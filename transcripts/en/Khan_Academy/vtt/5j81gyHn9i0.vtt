00:00:00.539 --> 00:00:01.696
- [Voiceover] See if you can evaluate

00:00:01.696 --> 00:00:04.300
this integral right over here.

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:05.713
Assuming you had a goal at it

00:00:05.713 --> 00:00:07.152
so let's work through this together.

00:00:07.152 --> 00:00:09.934
You probably realized that
some of the traditional

00:00:09.934 --> 00:00:11.831
techniques that we've already had

00:00:11.831 --> 00:00:13.592
in our tool kits don't seem to be directly

00:00:13.592 --> 00:00:17.727
applicable, u-substitution and others.

00:00:17.727 --> 00:00:19.770
The key here to realize
is we have a rational

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.167
expression here where the
numerator has the same

00:00:23.167 --> 00:00:25.390
degree or higher than the denominator.

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:26.647
In this case, the numerator

00:00:26.647 --> 00:00:29.115
and the denominator have the same degree.

00:00:29.115 --> 00:00:32.482
Whenever you see something
like that, it's probably a good

00:00:32.482 --> 00:00:36.152
idea to divide the denominator
into the numerator.

00:00:36.152 --> 00:00:37.478
That's what this rational expression

00:00:37.478 --> 00:00:38.643
could be interpreted as.

00:00:38.643 --> 00:00:42.002
X minus five, divided by
negative two x plus two.

00:00:42.002 --> 00:00:44.657
So it's a little bit of
algebraic long division.

00:00:44.657 --> 00:00:46.205
To actually divide negative two x plus two

00:00:46.205 --> 00:00:48.209
into x minus five is to
see if we can rewrite this

00:00:48.209 --> 00:00:51.686
in a way where we can
evaluate the integral.

00:00:51.686 --> 00:00:52.764
So let's do that.

00:00:52.764 --> 00:00:57.518
We're going to take x minus five.

00:00:57.518 --> 00:01:02.518
X minus five, and divide negative
two x plus two into that.

00:01:04.752 --> 00:01:08.678
Negative two x plus two.

00:01:08.678 --> 00:01:10.749
Look at the highest degree terms.

00:01:10.749 --> 00:01:15.235
How many times does
negative two x go into x?

00:01:15.235 --> 00:01:18.866
Let's going to go negative 1/2 times.

00:01:18.866 --> 00:01:23.456
Negative 1/2 times two is negative one.

00:01:23.456 --> 00:01:26.477
Negative 1/2 times negative two x is

00:01:26.477 --> 00:01:28.737
this is going to be positive x.

00:01:28.737 --> 00:01:30.099
Just like that.

00:01:30.099 --> 00:01:32.170
Now we want to subtract
this yellow expression

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:35.722
from this blue expression,
and so let's just,

00:01:35.722 --> 00:01:37.712
I'll just take the negative
of this and then add.

00:01:37.712 --> 00:01:41.470
So I'm just going to take
the negative of it and add.

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:45.788
We are left with negative five
plus one is negative four.

00:01:45.788 --> 00:01:48.201
You could say negative two
x plus two goes into x minus

00:01:48.201 --> 00:01:51.494
five, negative 1/2 times
with negative four left over.

00:01:51.494 --> 00:01:56.085
So we can rewrite this integral,
our original integral as,

00:01:56.085 --> 00:02:01.085
we can rewrite it as
negative 1/2 minus four

00:02:06.242 --> 00:02:11.242
over negative two x plus two, d x.

00:02:16.868 --> 00:02:18.487
Now let's see, looks like we can simplify

00:02:18.487 --> 00:02:19.998
this expression a little bit more.

00:02:19.998 --> 00:02:21.655
The numerator and the denominator,

00:02:21.655 --> 00:02:23.122
they're both divisible by two.

00:02:23.122 --> 00:02:25.282
All of these terms are divisible by two.

00:02:25.282 --> 00:02:26.621
Actually, we all have these negatives

00:02:26.621 --> 00:02:29.442
that always unnecessarily
complicate things.

00:02:29.442 --> 00:02:30.800
Let's actually divide the numerator

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.090
and the denominator by negative two.

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:36.042
What are we going to have then?

00:02:36.042 --> 00:02:37.649
We divide the numerator by negative two.

00:02:37.649 --> 00:02:39.789
If this is negative four, this is

00:02:39.789 --> 00:02:42.436
going to become positive two.

00:02:42.436 --> 00:02:44.363
Then this, if we divide negative two x

00:02:44.363 --> 00:02:46.989
by negative two, that's
just going to become x.

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:50.994
Then two divided by negative
two is going to be minus one.

00:02:50.994 --> 00:02:52.853
So our original integral...

00:02:52.853 --> 00:02:53.901
This is just all algebra.

00:02:53.901 --> 00:02:55.396
Everything we've done so far is algebra.

00:02:55.396 --> 00:02:56.903
We just rewritten it using a little bit

00:02:56.903 --> 00:02:58.575
of algebraic long division.

00:02:58.575 --> 00:03:02.667
Our original integral has
simplified to negative 1/2,

00:03:02.667 --> 00:03:04.458
and some might argue it's not simplified

00:03:04.458 --> 00:03:07.168
but it's actually much more
useful for finding the integral.

00:03:07.168 --> 00:03:12.168
Negative 1/2 plus two
over x minus one, d x.

00:03:16.376 --> 00:03:19.005
Now, how do we evaluate this?

00:03:19.005 --> 00:03:23.021
Well, the antiderivative

00:03:23.021 --> 00:03:26.072
of negative 1/2 is
pretty straight forward.

00:03:26.072 --> 00:03:31.072
That's just going to be negative 1/2 x,

00:03:31.585 --> 00:03:35.425
plus the entire derivative
of two over x minus one.

00:03:35.425 --> 00:03:36.690
You might reduce here ahead.

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:39.408
The derivative of x minus one is just one

00:03:39.408 --> 00:03:42.251
so you could say that the
derivative is sitting there.

00:03:42.251 --> 00:03:44.338
We can essentially use
substitution in our heads

00:03:44.338 --> 00:03:47.269
and say, "Okay, let's just
take the entire derivative,

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:49.684
"we could say with respect
to x minus one which will be

00:03:49.684 --> 00:03:52.456
"the natural log of the
absolute value of x minus one."

00:03:52.456 --> 00:03:53.958
If all of that sounds really confusing,

00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:56.424
I'll let you do the u-substitution.

00:03:56.424 --> 00:04:01.424
If I were just trying to evaluate

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:06.995
the integral two over x minus one, d x,

00:04:06.995 --> 00:04:10.849
I could see, okay, the derivative
of x minus one is just one

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:15.217
so I could say u is equal to x minus one,

00:04:15.217 --> 00:04:19.529
and then d u is going to be equal to d x.

00:04:19.529 --> 00:04:23.547
This is going to be, we can
rewrite in terms of u as two,

00:04:23.547 --> 00:04:27.218
I'll just take the constant
out two times the integral

00:04:27.218 --> 00:04:32.218
of one over u, d u, which
we know as two times

00:04:32.487 --> 00:04:37.411
the natural log of the
absolute value of u plus c.

00:04:37.411 --> 00:04:40.689
In this case, we know
that u is x minus one.

00:04:40.689 --> 00:04:41.939
This is equal to two times

00:04:41.939 --> 00:04:46.939
the natural log of x minus one plus c.

00:04:47.463 --> 00:04:49.681
That's what we're going
to have right over here.

00:04:49.681 --> 00:04:53.229
So plus two times the natural log

00:04:53.229 --> 00:04:57.456
of the absolute value
of x minus one plus c.

00:04:57.456 --> 00:04:59.029
The plus c doesn't just
come from this one,

00:04:59.029 --> 00:05:02.626
this general overtaking the
integral of the whole thing.

00:05:02.626 --> 00:05:05.066
It could be some constant
because if we go the other way,

00:05:05.066 --> 00:05:08.090
we take the derivative and
the constant will go away.

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:12.130
Let me just put the
plus c right over there,

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:17.130
and we are done.
