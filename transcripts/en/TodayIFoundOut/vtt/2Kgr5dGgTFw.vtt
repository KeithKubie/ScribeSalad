00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:15.940
On March 3, 1876, one Mrs. Crouch was working
in her yard in Bath County, Kentucky, making

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:21.670
soap, when suddenly “meat which looked like
beef began to fall all around her. The sky

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:26.100
was perfectly clear at the time.” Falling
like large snowflakes and settling all around

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:30.620
the 5000 square foot yard, pieces of flesh
ranging in size from about two inches square

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:34.600
to four, dotted the ground and were even stuck
on the fences. When it first appeared, the

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:39.350
meat was said to be fresh, and, accordingly,
two unidentified (but brave) men even sampled

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:43.610
it. They claimed it tasted a bit gamey – like
mutton or even venison.

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:47.220
The story was published in the New York Times
on March 9th, and it caught the attention

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:51.410
of Leopold Brandeis who was able to get his
hands on a sample that had been preserved

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:55.990
in glycerine. After examining it, Brandeis
declared that the meat wasn’t a supernatural

00:00:55.990 --> 00:01:01.449
phenomenon, or in fact, according to him,
even meat at all, but a substance called nostoc.

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:05.080
Nostoc has been known to scientists since
at least the 16th century when it was named

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:09.540
by Paracelsus. As with the Kentucky shower,
early on people believed that nostoc fell

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.870
from the sky in large chunks (or more rightly
blobs), and to medieval people it was known

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:18.040
as “witch’s jelly” and “troll’s
butter.”

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:22.220
Technically a genus of cyanobacteria that
live in colonies, it’s not clear when people

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:27.350
realized that nostoc does not, in fact, come
from the sky, but rather lives in the soil

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:31.540
and on moist surfaces. When dry, it is easy
to overlook nostoc as it appears as a dark,

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:36.561
flaky crust; however, after a rain, nostoc
will swell up into jelly-like masses. This

00:01:36.561 --> 00:01:41.790
led people to think it fell from the sky with
rain, thus one of its nicknames “star jelly.”

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.930
Edible and said to taste like chicken or frog,
Brandeis was convinced that the Crouch’s

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:51.000
had nothing more than bacterial blobs on their
hands; however, although his theory accounted

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.440
for some of the details in the report, he
had overlooked two important points – eye

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:01.310
witness testimony claims they actually saw
the substance falling from the sky and it

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:03.680
was a clear day with no rain.

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:09.060
Further investigations were also conducted,
including one by histologist, Dr. A. Mead

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.970
Edwards, who also examined the chunks. He
concluded that the substance was definitely

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:18.170
not nostoc, but rather hunks of flesh. From
the tissue samples he had, it appeared to

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:21.189
come from the lungs of either a horse or a
human baby.

00:02:21.189 --> 00:02:26.900
A third investigation by another histologist,
Dr. J.W.S. Arnold, confirmed the presence

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:32.769
of lung tissue, but also found animal cartilage.
Subsequent investigations confirmed both histologists’

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:35.790
findings and also revealed muscular tissue.

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:42.959
Finally, one man provided a theory that covered
all of the facts. L. D. Kastenbine, M.D.,

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:46.480
a Professor of Chemistry at the Louisville
College of Pharmacy, published an article

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:51.139
on the matter that same year in the Louisville
Medical Journal. Kastenbine concluded that

00:02:51.139 --> 00:02:55.659
the best explanation was that supplied by
an old Ohio farmer: the meat had been vomited

00:02:55.659 --> 00:03:00.050
by several vultures who were flying too high
to be seen (some varieties of vulture can

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:13.920
fly as high as 40,000 feet; for reference
Mount Everest is about 29,029 feet). Given

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:18.480
that the chunks fell from a great height,
they were scattered by the wind over a relatively

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:19.680
large area.

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.159
Both the turkey vulture, Cathartes aura, and
the black vulture, Coragyps atratus, are found

00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:26.379
in that part of Kentucky, and both have been
observed projectile vomiting the contents

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:31.090
of their stomachs, sometimes in or just before
they take flight. They particular do this

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:35.609
in the presence of a predator, with the discarded
contents of their stomachs simultaneously

00:03:35.609 --> 00:03:40.459
distracting the predator while also lightening
the vulture’s load for flight. When one

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:43.981
vomits, this also often induces others nearby
to vomit as well. As to why this particular

00:03:43.981 --> 00:03:47.939
flock of vultures chose to vomit mid-flight
is anybody’s guess, but at least the theory

00:03:47.939 --> 00:03:52.939
seems the most plausible explanation for this
bizarre phenomenon.

00:03:52.939 --> 00:03:57.319
In November of 1970, whale meat rained from
the sky over a portion of Oregon. The cause

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:01.290
of this one is definitively known. The Oregon
Department of Transportation had the bright

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:06.139
idea of disposing of a dead beached sperm
whale by blowing it up with a half a ton of

00:04:06.139 --> 00:04:11.269
dynamite. This did not work out as anticipated
and instead of disintegrating much of the

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:16.299
whale, instead huge flying, very dangerous,
chunks of whale were launched in all directions,

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:23.060
with one large chunk destroying a car some
1/4 of a mile away from the detonation point.

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:27.860
Frogs and toads have been reported falling
from the skies many times. In 1794, near Lalain,

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:33.390
France, 150 French soldiers were pelted with
hundreds of toads, many of which still retained

00:04:33.390 --> 00:05:18.420
some of their tadpole tails.
