00:00:06.606 --> 00:00:08.639
Acids and bases are everywhere.

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:10.215
They're used to make foods,

00:00:10.215 --> 00:00:11.540
soaps and detergents,

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:12.316
fertilizers,

00:00:12.316 --> 00:00:13.485
explosives,

00:00:13.485 --> 00:00:14.200
dyes,

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:14.650
plastics,

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:15.312
pesticides,

00:00:15.312 --> 00:00:16.545
even paper.

00:00:16.545 --> 00:00:18.212
Our stomachs are very acidic.

00:00:18.212 --> 00:00:20.038
Our blood is slightly basic.

00:00:20.038 --> 00:00:22.907
Our proteins are made up of amino acids,

00:00:22.907 --> 00:00:24.623
and the letters in our genetic code,

00:00:24.623 --> 00:00:26.828
those As, Ts, Cs, and Gs,

00:00:26.828 --> 00:00:28.649
are all bases.

00:00:28.649 --> 00:00:29.508
You were probably taught

00:00:29.508 --> 00:00:30.864
how acids and bases behave

00:00:30.864 --> 00:00:32.450
on the molecular level.

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:34.129
You were probably never taught

00:00:34.129 --> 00:00:35.247
that a long time ago,

00:00:35.247 --> 00:00:37.305
like ancient Greek ago,

00:00:37.305 --> 00:00:39.673
before anyone knew about atoms or molecules,

00:00:39.673 --> 00:00:41.212
acids and bases were defined

00:00:41.212 --> 00:00:43.008
by how they behaved.

00:00:43.008 --> 00:00:46.460
Acids tasted sour and corroded metal.

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:48.120
Bases felt slippery

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.934
and could somehow counteract acids.

00:00:52.395 --> 00:00:54.599
When molecules dissolved in water interact,

00:00:54.599 --> 00:00:56.540
they are exchanging two main currencies

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:58.198
with their surroundings:

00:00:58.198 --> 00:01:01.035
protons, also known as hydrogen ions,

00:01:01.035 --> 00:01:02.448
and electrons.

00:01:02.448 --> 00:01:05.339
Depending on how a molecule is composed or shaped,

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.537
it may be willing to donate or accept

00:01:07.537 --> 00:01:09.118
either protons or electrons

00:01:09.118 --> 00:01:11.331
with some other community member.

00:01:11.331 --> 00:01:14.427
And some molecules are far more aggressive than others

00:01:14.427 --> 00:01:17.873
when it comes to donating or accepting either currency.

00:01:17.873 --> 00:01:19.955
Remember that protons are positively charged

00:01:19.955 --> 00:01:22.280
and electrons are negatively charged.

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.980
So, if a molecule is willing to give up a proton,

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:26.230
that's not too different

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:28.745
from it being willing to accept an electron --

00:01:28.745 --> 00:01:31.980
either way it's becoming more negatively charged.

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:34.489
Other molecules are willing to accept a proton

00:01:34.489 --> 00:01:36.327
or give up an electron.

00:01:36.327 --> 00:01:38.649
These are becoming more positively charged.

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:41.040
Some substances are so aggressive

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.572
about donating their protons

00:01:42.572 --> 00:01:43.782
that when they get a chance,

00:01:43.782 --> 00:01:45.620
all of the molecules in a sample

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:46.994
will dump a proton,

00:01:46.994 --> 00:01:48.288
sometimes more than one,

00:01:48.288 --> 00:01:50.285
to the surrounding water molecules.

00:01:50.285 --> 00:01:53.120
We call these strong acids.

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:54.837
Meanwhile, some compounds are so ready

00:01:54.837 --> 00:01:56.117
to accept a proton

00:01:56.117 --> 00:01:57.369
that they won't wait around,

00:01:57.369 --> 00:01:59.009
they'll just rip one off water,

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:00.535
which usually has two protons

00:02:00.535 --> 00:02:03.143
but is generous enough to hang out with just one.

00:02:03.143 --> 00:02:05.513
We call these strong bases.

00:02:05.513 --> 00:02:08.303
Other acids and bases are not so strong.

00:02:08.303 --> 00:02:11.313
They may donate just a few of their protons to water

00:02:11.313 --> 00:02:13.642
or accept just a few protons from water,

00:02:13.642 --> 00:02:16.708
but most of their molecules stay exactly the same.

00:02:16.708 --> 00:02:18.412
If left alone in water,

00:02:18.412 --> 00:02:20.243
they'll reach some equilibrium point

00:02:20.243 --> 00:02:22.073
where maybe only one out of a hundred

00:02:22.073 --> 00:02:23.906
or one out of ten thousand of their molecules

00:02:23.906 --> 00:02:26.455
has exchanged currency with water.

00:02:26.455 --> 00:02:27.577
As you might guess,

00:02:27.577 --> 00:02:30.159
we label these acids and bases weak,

00:02:30.159 --> 00:02:31.451
but in the common sense of the word,

00:02:31.451 --> 00:02:32.747
they're not weak.

00:02:32.747 --> 00:02:34.372
The vinegar in your salad dressing

00:02:34.372 --> 00:02:36.124
that you can smell from across the room,

00:02:36.124 --> 00:02:38.207
that is a weak acid.

00:02:38.207 --> 00:02:39.427
The ammonia you spray on glass

00:02:39.427 --> 00:02:40.553
for a streak-free shine,

00:02:40.553 --> 00:02:42.420
that is a weak base.

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.058
So, it doesn't take much to be an active player

00:02:45.058 --> 00:02:46.938
in the chemical economy.

00:02:47.676 --> 00:02:50.349
Most acid-base chemistry takes place in water,

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:53.068
which can act as either an acid or a base,

00:02:53.068 --> 00:02:54.996
accepting deposits and enabling withdrawals

00:02:54.996 --> 00:02:57.823
like a 24-hour molecular ATM.

00:02:57.823 --> 00:03:00.084
And when a proton-deposit customer,

00:03:00.084 --> 00:03:01.159
that's an acid,

00:03:01.159 --> 00:03:03.530
and a proton-withdrawal customer,

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:04.340
the base,

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:05.721
shop at the same time,

00:03:05.721 --> 00:03:07.503
their net effect on water's account

00:03:07.503 --> 00:03:09.087
may cancel out,

00:03:09.087 --> 00:03:11.737
and we call this neutralization.

00:03:11.737 --> 00:03:13.682
Now, certain molecules can behave

00:03:13.682 --> 00:03:15.889
as acids or bases without water,

00:03:15.889 --> 00:03:17.469
but that's another story.

00:03:17.469 --> 00:03:19.139
Let's end by saluting water

00:03:19.139 --> 00:03:20.890
as the resilient and fair banker

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:22.718
for acids and bases.

00:03:22.718 --> 00:03:24.020
It's always open for business,

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:25.222
doesn't charge interest,

00:03:25.222 --> 00:03:27.522
and will never foreclose on your molecules,

00:03:27.522 --> 00:03:30.463
which is more than I can say for [bleep].

00:03:30.816 --> 00:03:31.941
Waah-waah.
