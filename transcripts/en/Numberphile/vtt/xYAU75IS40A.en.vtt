00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:01.680
BRADY HARAN: So I was out doing
the shopping the other

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:06.210
day, and I walked
past Alphabetti.

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:08.480
What words can you spell?

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:11.410
But then something else
caught my eye.

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:12.750
Numberetti.

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:14.970
What's the biggest number
you can make?

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:17.985
Those evil geniuses at Heinz
know that no self-respecting

00:00:17.985 --> 00:00:20.300
Numberphile can resist
that challenge.

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:22.860
And that's what this
video is about.

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:25.190
Now of course, a highbrow
filmmaker like me doesn't want

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:28.180
to get his hands dirty, so I've
brought in the neighbors,

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:29.830
Danny and Emily.

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:33.200
And before you accuse me of
using slave labor, make sure

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.470
you watch the end of this video
when we negotiate an

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:36.385
appearance fee.

00:00:36.385 --> 00:00:39.870
So here we go, extracting
the numbers.

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.832
It's a dirty business.

00:00:41.832 --> 00:00:44.330
EMILY: Is that a seven?

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:46.570
BRADY HARAN: Now if you take all
these numbers and just add

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:51.430
them together, you come up
with quite a modest 881.

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:54.200
Then we tried multiplying them
together, and we came up with

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:55.450
a slightly more impressive.

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.500
But an even bigger number comes
when you displace the

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.740
numbers end on end, making
one big integer.

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:05.510
This is going to take a while,
and I probably won't include

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:08.060
all of it in this video
for obvious reasons.

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.992
999 tresexagintillion, 999

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.340

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.380
100 nonillion.

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:42.460
That's it.

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:44.220
So here are the digits.

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.010
I'd be curious to know what
the biggest number you can

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:48.420
come up with is.

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.990
First of all, using
just addition.

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.940
Or maybe using just
multiplication.

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:58.280
And lastly, what's the biggest
number you can make if we

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.110
bring powers into play?

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:03.040
You can leave a message under
the video, or if you think

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:04.750
you're going to bust the
character limit, and I think

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:07.810
there's a chance you might, you
can also send me an email.

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:10.289
And depending on what you come
up with, we might make another

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:14.640
video about the biggest number
you can make from a tin of

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:15.930
Numberetti.

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:17.603
You've got two options here.

00:02:17.603 --> 00:02:18.350
DANNY: Yep.

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:21.720
BRADY HARAN: I will give each of
you four pounds right now.

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:22.510
EMILY: Yeah.

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:23.720
BRADY HARAN: You can walk
out the door with it.

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:24.590
EMILY: OK.

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:29.770
BRADY HARAN: Or I will put that
on eBay, and let all the

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:32.630
people who watch my videos
decide what they want to pay

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:34.030
for that piece of paper.

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.080
And all the money raised
will go to you

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:38.640
guys to split in half.

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:39.990
DANNY: Half.

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.335
EMILY: Don't.

00:02:40.335 --> 00:02:40.880
BRADY HARAN: What do you want?

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.480
Do you want four pounds each in
your pocket now, or do you

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.990
want the people who watch
my videos to decide?

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.930
EMILY: How long will the--

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:48.530
how long will it go on for?

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:49.370
BRADY HARAN: One week.

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:50.860
Seven days I'll have to bid.

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:53.076
Seven days from when
the video goes on.

00:02:53.076 --> 00:02:54.048
EMILY: What do you
reckon then?

00:02:54.048 --> 00:02:56.964
It can't hurt.

00:02:56.964 --> 00:02:58.422
DANNY: I reckon eBay.

00:02:58.422 --> 00:03:00.366
EMILY: Should go for eBay.

00:03:00.366 --> 00:03:00.852
DANNY: Yeah.

00:03:00.852 --> 00:03:01.340
EMILY: OK.

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.710
Yep.

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:02.810
BRADY HARAN: All right,
there you go.

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:04.180
So there you go, everyone.

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.890
They could've taken four pounds
each right now, but

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:09.560
they're going to let you decide
how much they get.

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.310
So that piece of paper is
going to be on eBay, and

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:15.320
whatever's raised goes
to these guys.

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:16.530
DANNY: Ugh.

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:17.800
BRADY HARAN: Do you think you
made a good decision?

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:18.220
EMILY: Yeah.

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:18.640
DANNY: Yeah.

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:20.530
BRADY HARAN: So the eBay link
is in the video description,

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:21.690
and will be for one week.

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:23.490
And if you're curious about
what we did with that

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:25.890
Numberetti after we filmed
with it, there's

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:27.140
another link for you.
