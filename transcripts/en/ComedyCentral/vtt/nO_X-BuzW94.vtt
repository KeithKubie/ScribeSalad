00:00:01.502 --> 00:00:04.371
It's time
to play Poster Children.

00:00:04.404 --> 00:00:06.306
Poster Children.

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.847
If you can remember the '70s,
you weren't there, man.

00:00:13.881 --> 00:00:15.883
Or you were probably
not even born.

00:00:15.916 --> 00:00:17.918
Uh, I-I wasn't.
I was born in, like, '80...

00:00:17.951 --> 00:00:19.119
(stammers)
...eight.

00:00:19.152 --> 00:00:21.722
Um, either way, that decade
was jammed

00:00:21.755 --> 00:00:24.024
with primitive inspirational
posters that adorned the walls

00:00:24.057 --> 00:00:25.726
of junior high guidance offices.

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:28.161
We found an archive of these
wonderful, inspirational

00:00:28.195 --> 00:00:30.397
roll-ups on westword.com.

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:32.299
So comedians, some
of the messages on the posters

00:00:32.332 --> 00:00:34.034
seem like unfinished thoughts.

00:00:34.067 --> 00:00:36.670
So for 250 points, just tell us
the rest of the phrase.

00:00:36.703 --> 00:00:39.173
First up,
"Know and accept yourself."

00:00:39.206 --> 00:00:41.074
"Know and accept yourself."
Matt.

00:00:41.108 --> 00:00:43.343
Your mom was a horse
and your dad was a cowboy

00:00:43.377 --> 00:00:45.846
and that makes you
a beautiful centaur.

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:48.315
-You can't see. -Oh, yeah, you
can't see from the waste down.

00:00:48.348 --> 00:00:49.783
You can't see
from the waist down.

00:00:49.816 --> 00:00:52.019
Yeah, it's all...
it's all horse down here.

00:00:52.052 --> 00:00:53.720
-Just all horse.
-See?

00:00:53.754 --> 00:00:55.322
Yeah. Hari.

00:00:55.355 --> 00:00:57.958
Uh, you will never
get off this farm.

00:01:03.163 --> 00:01:04.698
Grace.

00:01:04.731 --> 00:01:07.668
What happened between and you
Farmer Bill is in the past.

00:01:09.903 --> 00:01:11.839
Yeah. Points.

00:01:15.075 --> 00:01:17.678
All right, next,
"Tell it truthfully."

00:01:17.711 --> 00:01:19.746
"Tell it truthfully."

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:21.081
Uh, Hari.

00:01:21.114 --> 00:01:23.750
Your dick is a fish.

00:01:23.784 --> 00:01:26.420
Mm-hmm. Yup. Yup.

00:01:26.453 --> 00:01:28.655
-Yeah.
-KONDABOLU: Obviously.

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:30.224
Points.
Grace.

00:01:30.257 --> 00:01:33.193
You drowned that blind kid,
didn't you?

00:01:40.534 --> 00:01:44.071
Next one.
"I'm okay and you're okay."

00:01:44.104 --> 00:01:46.073
"I'm okay and you're okay."
Grace.

00:01:46.106 --> 00:01:48.509
It's normal for three
out of four teens

00:01:48.542 --> 00:01:51.345
to (bleep) their pants
playing basketball.

00:01:52.946 --> 00:01:55.482
Points.
Wait a minute.

00:01:58.452 --> 00:02:00.354
To be fair...

00:02:00.387 --> 00:02:02.823
To be fair, this one looks like

00:02:02.856 --> 00:02:05.192
he's really trying not to.

00:02:05.225 --> 00:02:07.027
"I'm not gonna be the fourth."

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.329
And she is freaking
the (bleep) out about it.

00:02:09.363 --> 00:02:10.664
Yeah, she's like... -What's
going on?

00:02:10.697 --> 00:02:12.065
You-you know why--

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:14.868
he's... he wiped some
on the ball. Look.

00:02:14.902 --> 00:02:18.071
Like, dude, stop.

00:02:18.105 --> 00:02:21.909
I don't want to play four square
anymore with you.

00:02:21.942 --> 00:02:25.712
Next, "Things we learn
can help us now."

00:02:25.746 --> 00:02:28.382
"Things we learn can..." Hey,
look, they're reading a magazine

00:02:28.415 --> 00:02:32.152
called <i>Fun.</i> Look at how much fun
they're having, Hari.

00:02:32.186 --> 00:02:34.821
Perhaps there is
information in here

00:02:34.855 --> 00:02:37.424
that will get us out of this
stranger's basement.

00:02:45.732 --> 00:02:47.401
Braunger.

00:02:47.434 --> 00:02:50.337
Dock worker Jim says this
magazine <i>Fun</i> is the filthiest

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.406
porno mag you can
get your hands on.

00:02:52.439 --> 00:02:54.508
I mean, it's practically
illegal, dude.

00:02:54.541 --> 00:02:55.943
Yeah, points.
Points.

00:02:55.976 --> 00:02:57.144
-Oh.
-Next one.

00:02:57.177 --> 00:02:59.146
"Every member
of a group is important."

00:02:59.179 --> 00:03:02.916
"Every member of a group
is important." Matt Braunger.

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:05.519
Even Rusty, who's too stoned
to get off the bench.

00:03:05.552 --> 00:03:08.055
Yeah, points.
Yup.

00:03:08.088 --> 00:03:09.857
-Hey, man.
-What?

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:11.391
Hari.

00:03:11.425 --> 00:03:13.460
How come only the white kids
get to play?

00:03:13.493 --> 00:03:16.163
Yeah.

00:03:16.196 --> 00:03:17.364
Oh.

00:03:17.397 --> 00:03:19.766
Oh... Oh, you know why?

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.402
Uh, this is the, uh, Oscar's
league, uh, softball team.

00:03:22.436 --> 00:03:24.171
Oh!

00:03:24.204 --> 00:03:25.672
Get 'em.
Get 'em.

00:03:25.706 --> 00:03:25.772
Get 'em.
