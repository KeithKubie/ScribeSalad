00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.900
The third HIE classification
is architecture.

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:08.850
The main types are Centralized HIE
which involves a master

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:10.610
repository of patient data.

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:16.420
Federated HIEs where all
data remains at the source.

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:20.410
And Hybrid HIEs where clinical
data is either stored locally with

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:23.490
centralized services to help locate it,
or

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.100
in an alternative approach
there are data lockers,

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:31.290
where any centrally stored clinical
data is segregated by institution, and

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:34.490
each contributing institution
controls access to their data.
