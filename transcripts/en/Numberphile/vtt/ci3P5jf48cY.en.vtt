00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:02.640
ALEX BELLOS: These are the
English and American versions

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:05.180
of the same book, of
my book on numbers.

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:08.330
The English version, Alex's
Adventures in Numberland,

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:10.390
which was the first title
I came up with.

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:13.250
But then when we took it to the
American publishers, they

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:15.760
said, who's Alex?

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:17.210
Not going to work in America.

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:19.430
So we came up with another one,
which is kind of funnier,

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:22.450
Here's Looking at Euclid, which
when I then suggested to

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:26.310
the British publishers, they
said, well, who's Euclid?

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.490
So it actually works really
well for both different

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:29.900
territories.

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.189
Because in America, it
seems that everyone

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:33.730
has heard of Euclid.

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:34.700
And I'm not sure--

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.390
I'm never sure if this is
because Americans have better

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:42.090
geometry lessons or if it's
because Euclid appears a lot

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.390
more in street names and
city names in the US.

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:51.030
Actually, my theory is that the
reason why the Americans

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.420
name cities and streets after
Euclid is because the Founding

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.415
Fathers were Masons, and the
Masons were big into geometry.

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.310
I studied maths and philosophy
at university, but then I

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:06.420
became a journalist.

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:07.630
And then I ended
up as a foreign

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:10.030
correspondent in Brazil.

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:13.990
And so when I decided to write
about math, I decided to write

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:15.890
about math in the way
that a foreign

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:17.450
correspondent would write.

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:20.580
So I traveled all around the
world, interviewing different

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.880
people to do with numbers
and maths.

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:27.050
And it seemed to me that in a
sense, I was doing just what I

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:30.040
was doing as a foreign
correspondent, but I wasn't

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:31.180
going to any one country.

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:33.050
I was going to a kind of
fictitious country,

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:34.110
Numberland.

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.730
So in the same way that when I
was in Brazil, I would fly to

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:42.220
the Amazon and do a report, and
then explain it to people

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:43.800
who'd never been there.

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:48.030
In Numberland, I can fly to
the land of algebra or the

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.650
land of geometry, explain it,
come back, and give a report,

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:54.940
explain to people who don't
really understand the land of

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:58.260
algebra or geometry, and
explain how it is.

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:06.020
So I was also lucky that I've
had about 20 translations.

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.410
And I've got some of them here,
which has been done.

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:10.580
So we start here with Italian.

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:13.590
Il Meraviglioso Mondo
dei Numeri.

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.430
There are lots of
books around.

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:17.720
And there are lots of
books on numbers.

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:23.420
But I guess I felt there was a
gap in the market for a book

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:32.160
about numbers that was
accessible to the lay reader

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.500
in a way that other books
haven't been.

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.580
There have been books written
aimed at the lay reader, and

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:40.500
some of them should be
very successful.

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.960
But nothing really that's been
written by a news reporter.

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:47.890
Alex au Pays des Chiffres,
which is the French one.

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:50.660
Alex en el Pais de los
Numeros, which

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:52.090
is the Spanish one.

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:53.600
I hoped it would work.

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:54.980
I didn't know whether
it would.

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:56.510
I thought, maybe one of the
reasons why it hasn't been

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:59.110
done before is that it's
impossible to do.

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:02.790
But actually, using reportage
and journalism to write about

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:04.860
math, I think, works.

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:09.540
And I think I have brought
a new audience--

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:13.030
even if that audience is quite
small-- a new audience to

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:14.510
buying books about math.

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:18.320
And definitely if you read the
comments or the feedback about

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:21.650
the book, you do get lots of
people saying, oh my god, I've

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:24.590
never been interested in math
before, but I read this, and

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:25.520
it's quite interesting.

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:29.390
Kiehtova Matematikka, with a
little joke on the pi there,

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:31.620
which is Finnish.

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.580
Alex No Pais Dos Numeros,
from Brazil.

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:40.420
Always, when I'm writing, I'm
thinking, could the man on the

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:42.250
street read this?

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:44.000
Maybe a slightly educated
man on the street.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.600
Because there are lots of people
who, you just put a

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.770
number in there and they don't
understand it at all.

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:50.550
But could someone who--

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:52.700
if you can read Freakonomics
and understand, if you can

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:58.030
read the financial pages of a
newspaper, if you've got GCSC

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:01.170
Maths, you should be able
to get quite a lot

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:02.300
out of what I write.

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:03.710
That's the aim.

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:08.490
Getallen Ontraadseld,
which is Dutch.

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:11.320
And that's the American, Here's
Looking at Euclid.

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:14.300
Pace is very difficult, because
you need to go slow

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:18.230
enough to take everyone with
you, but not so slow that

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:20.480
people who understand it
get a little bit bored.

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:21.990
So how did you do that?

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:28.740
You need to kind of sugar the
pill by including lots of

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:31.240
interesting color
and observation.

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:33.850
But you can't have too much of
that, because looks like it's

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:34.860
just filler.

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:36.150
Essentially, what you
need is you need a

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:37.900
really strong narrative.

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:41.080
You need people to want to know
what's going to happen.

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:44.190
And actually, my favorite
is the German

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:45.600
one, which is here--

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:49.240
Alex im Wunderland der Zahlen,
because it's got this

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:51.790
fantastic picture of me
kind of surfing an

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:53.500
abacus in my slippers.

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:56.320
I don't know which picture
they used, but--

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:59.328
BRADY HARAN: I've got you,
there, and let me zoom in on--

00:04:59.328 --> 00:05:00.980
oh, yeah.

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:02.790
Yeah, that looks
a bit like you.

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:07.140
It is said that the minute you
put an equation in a piece of

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:08.910
text, you lose half
the readers.

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:10.690
I don't think that's true.

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:13.850
If you put it in--

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:15.370
if you build up the
equation and you

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:17.070
explain it well enough--

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:18.960
but still, you can't have
that many equations.

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:21.270
There's always going to be
more words than there are

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:24.820
numbers or equations per page.

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:31.900
And that can be quite difficult,
because maths

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:34.150
naturally has lots of number
and equations in it.

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:35.780
BRADY HARAN: Is your
book about numbers?

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:37.380
Or is your book about maths?

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:39.310
ALEX BELLOS: No, my book
is about maths.

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:43.140
And I started to write my book
about maths without having a

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:44.360
title for it.

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:45.900
And it was only halfway
through that

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:48.150
the title came up.

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:50.690
But even though it's a book
about maths, most people

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:53.020
think, well, maths and numbers
are the same thing.

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:56.420
So you know, the first 100 pages
of my book is really

00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:57.910
about numbers-- the
birth of numbers.

00:05:57.910 --> 00:06:00.560
Where did they come from?

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:02.900
Tribes that don't
have numbers.

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:04.740
Animals that understand
numbers.

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:09.590
Base systems, why we count up
to 10 and not 12, say, or 8.

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:11.400
So I think that numbers is

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:14.270
essentially where maths starts.

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:16.960
And in any book about maths,
you need to kind

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:18.590
of cover that area.

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:23.750
But actually, maths is about
structure, and pattern, and

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:27.860
logic, and proofs,
and elegance, and

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:29.370
all those other things.

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:33.670
And sometimes-- the thing with
numbers is that numbers in

00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:35.700
themselves are actually
quite dry.

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:40.480
You need to use numbers to
explain other things.

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:43.720
BRADY HARAN: When you look back
and read the book now,

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:45.280
are there things you wish
you'd done differently?

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:47.000
Are there things you look at it
and go, I could have done

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:47.370
that better?

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:49.975
Or do you look at it and think,
I'm happy with that?

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:56.100
ALEX BELLOS: I think if you
ask most writers what they

00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:58.700
think when they read their
books, they just cringe with

00:06:58.700 --> 00:06:59.550
embarrassment.

00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:05.540
So it's not so far in the past
that I don't look at it and

00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:07.080
think, oh, I should have
done that a bit better.

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:09.740
That's not quite good enough.

00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:15.040
But actually, in terms of
sales, and reviews, and

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:17.820
acclaim, I can't complain,
so I guess I must

00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:19.070
be happy with it.
