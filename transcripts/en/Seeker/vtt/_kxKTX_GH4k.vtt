00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:18.630
Wormholes were theorized in 1935 by my buddy
Al Einstein and his pal Nathan Rosen as part

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.550
of the theory of general relativity.

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.590
They were called Einstein-Rosen "bridges,"
and are thought of as holes through space-time.

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.810
Wormholes have never been spotted, though
one Russian researcher believes he could spot

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:33.130
them with a radio telescope… but it's never
been done.

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:35.470
Until now, sort of.

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:39.460
Scientists at the Autonomous University of
Barcelona have created a magnetic wormhole

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:45.320
that appears to transfer a magnetic field
through quote "an extra special dimension."

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:49.710
Magnetic wormholes aren't space-time wormholes,
but they are a similar concept.

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.160
Space-time wormholes are a manipulation of
gravitational energy, which we don't YET know

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.050
how to do, whereas magnetic wormholes are
manipulating electromagnetic energy.

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.649
Which we're really good at.

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:04.140
Using metamaterials (something that gave me
a headache on DNews before) the scientists

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.470
were able to create a tunnel of magnetic energy
last year, and this year they made the tunnel

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:10.470
invisible.

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.710
See, while "normal" space-time wormholes connect
two points in this (or other) universes through

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:21.670
an unseen bridge, but this wormhole connects
two magnetic fields through an unseen bridge!

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:25.540
It's really key to point out, that if you
looked at the wormhole, you'd see it.

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:28.500
It's not invisible to the human eye, just
to magnetic sensing.

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.451
A normal magnet has two poles, North and South,
and they're opposed, with a magnetic field

00:01:33.451 --> 00:01:34.451
connecting them.

00:01:34.451 --> 00:01:39.530
In this case, their wormhole separated the
poles, singling them out, creating a monopole

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:42.100
-- something that does not happen in nature.

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.580
Researchers can't tell where the magnetic
field that connects those monopoles is, which

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:49.640
gives the illusion it's in a "special dimension."

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.580
This device makes a monopole pop into existence,
with no detectable connection to that pole

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:55.980
on the other side.

00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:00.240
Manipulation of magnetic fields is used for
Magnetic Resonance Imaging at hospitals.

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:05.130
MRI machines use giant magnets to force the
protons inside our bodies to align, then use

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.220
radio waves to knock them around, causing
them to show up on the scans.

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:14.750
MRI scanners are very sensitive to other magnetic
interference, and any metal can ruin the image

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:19.870
and be dangerous to the occupants; because
it's basically a giant electromagnet.

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:24.269
Not to mention people have to slide into that
claustrophobia-inducing tube.

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:29.870
With this new magnetic manipulation technique,
MRI machines might be built which could scan

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:35.090
multiple things at once without interference,
and wouldn't need one massive magnet.

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:39.770
Using a magnetic wormhole MRI they might be
able to do surgery and scan at the same time!

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:44.340
Plus, the manipulation of electromagnetic
fields isn't just big business in medical

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:45.340
science…

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:49.500
Remember way back in 2007 when Bush was president
and I was a server at a popular chain Italian

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:50.500
restaurant?

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:55.380
A study in Physical Review Letters made a
big splash when it found if you could manipulate

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:01.310
electromagnetic energy in such a way, to create
an "invisibility cloak," and that is essentially

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:03.419
what these Spanish researchers have done!

00:03:03.419 --> 00:03:09.360
They hid a magnetic field's distortions from
the outside, by using metamaterials, to create

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.579
an invisible electromagnetic wormhole.

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:15.610
In the end, this wormhole can't move anything
from one place to another, and, like much

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:21.150
scientific research, doesn't do anything super
practical at the moment, but it IS a proof-of-concept

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:25.150
for some future technologies and could be
used for things we haven't even thought of

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:26.150
yet.

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:29.690
On top of that, it's a great simulation of
the gravitational wormhole we sci-fi addicts

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:30.690
know and love!

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:35.220
So, when we finally learn to manipulate gravitational
energy on a massive scale… we'll have a

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:36.480
few more theories to work with.

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.840
If you're more into the mystery of gravitational
wormholes, Dr. Ian O'Neill and I did a podcast

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:45.900
over on TestTube Plus all about black holes,
wormholes, white holes and really insane physics.

00:03:45.900 --> 00:04:02.060
It was a great series!! (soundup-link to playlist)
There's also a link in the description if

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:06.090
you're on mobile, OR if you're more of a radio
person, check it out over on itunes!

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:10.769
We took all five episodes from YouTube and
smushed them into one kick-ass black hole

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:20.049
podcast.
