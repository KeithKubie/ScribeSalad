00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
In homework 3.4, you're asked to simulate circular robotic motion.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
We gave you some equations to help you along in your simulations.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
I want to give you those formulas again and explain where some of them came from.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
The first equation I want to talk about is this one.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.000
The radius of curvature is equal to the length of the vehicle over the tangent of alpha

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
where alpha is our steering angle. Let me write that up here.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
So where does this equation come from.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.000
To derive it, the key realization is that the front and rear tire do not travel along the same circle.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Here's my rear tire, and here's my front tire.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
They are, of course, separated by a distance that we called "L."

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Let's draw the circles that these tires travel along.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Well, this rear tire is actually going to travel along a smaller inner circle

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
while this tire is going to travel along a larger outer circle.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Since we defined our radius of curvature as the distance from the back tire to the center,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Let's label this r, and we can see that the line connecting these tires defines an axis,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000
and here we have our steering angle, alpha, from here.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Now we can do a little bit of geometry.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Let's make a right triangle.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Well, if this angle here is alpha, then this much be a 90 degree angle,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
because a radius intersecting with a tangent line always forms a right angle.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:37.000
That means that that this angle here must be equal to 90 degrees minus alpha,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:43.000
which means this angle, since this is a right triangle must be alpha.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Well, we're almost there. The tangent of this angle is equal to the opposite side,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
which is the length, over the adjacent side, which is the radius.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.000
So tangent of alpha is equal to L over r.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
We manipulate this equation a little bit, and we find that the radius of curvature

00:02:00.000 --> 09:59:59.000
is equal to the length of the vehicle over the tangent of the steering angle.
