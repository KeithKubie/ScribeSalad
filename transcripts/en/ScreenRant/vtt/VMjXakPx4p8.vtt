00:00:07.339 --> 00:00:11.850
If an entertainers finds success as a musician,
it only makes sense they try their hand at

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:12.850
acting.

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:16.070
There are some entertainers like Janet Jackson
and Frank Sinatra who are known for their

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:17.850
music but started out as actors.

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.650
Others emerge as musicians and transition
to film and television.

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:26.270
Here are the 10 Most Amazing Musicians Turned
Actors of all Time.

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:29.750
Queen Latifah
In the late 80s Queen Latifah was making her

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:34.090
way as a rapper and hip hop star following
her days beat boxing on the streets.

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:37.449
After the release of her successful album
“All Hail the Queen” the artist formerly

00:00:37.449 --> 00:00:41.390
known as Dana Owens took a swing at acting
and managed to hit some home runs.

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:44.790
After appearing on a few episodes of shows
like The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, Latifah

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:48.649
had a starring role on the Fox sitcom Living
Single which lasted five seasons while she

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:50.680
was also making her way to the big screen.

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:54.510
Since then she has been in countless films
and even received an Academy Award nomination

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.960
for her stellar performance in Chicago which
demonstrated her acting and musical talents.

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:00.300
All Hail the queen.

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.559
Harry Connick Jr.

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:06.469
In the 80s Harry Connick Jr. came out with
music showcasing his Sinatra-like crooning

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:07.469
ability.

00:01:07.469 --> 00:01:11.510
He made a name for himself with not only his
first album but also his Grammy winning compilation

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:13.759
for the When Harry Met Sally Soundtrack.

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:17.149
He was the handsome jazz musician that made
everyone’s mom swoon.

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:19.880
Making the hearts of the elderly skip a beat
was not enough.

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.280
Harry delved into acting with Memphis Belle
in 1990.

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.899
It wasn’t until his high profile roles in
Copycat and Independence Day that proved his

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:28.560
film appearances were not a fluke.

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.350
He was wildly charming in Hope Floats opposite
Sandra Bullock and used his velvet voice to

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:34.520
narrate My Dog Skip.

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:39.039
He gained a spot as a judge on American Idol
in 2010 but now that the show is over, Connick

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:45.529
can dedicate his time to what he does best;
utilizing his charisma on the big screen.

00:01:45.529 --> 00:01:49.499
Barbra Streisand
Barbra Streisand is a legendary performer

00:01:49.499 --> 00:01:51.349
with dozens of studio albums.

00:01:51.349 --> 00:01:54.670
She started out singing in nightclubs and
earning minor roles on Broadway.

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:58.689
After releasing her first album in 1963 she
emerged a star.

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:02.290
After a few years of sharing her musical talents
with the world, she starred in Funny Girl

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:06.869
and Hello Dolly proving her acting talent
was just as flawless as her singing voice.

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:12.180
The 1970s were a busy time for Babs with memorable
work in A Star is Born and the classic romance

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.180
The Way We Were.

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:17.719
Her talents have resulted in numerous awards
including multiple Academy Awards for both

00:02:17.719 --> 00:02:18.819
her music and acting.

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:22.620
In recent years she has only sporadically
worked in film and when she does, she goes

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.840
for the questionable comedies but that doesn’t
detract from her full wattage talent and her

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:32.870
legendary status.

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:36.630
Will Smith
Will Smith is one of the best examples of

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:40.560
a talented musician turned actor but acting
did not always come naturally to the Fresh

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:41.560
Prince.

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:44.549
After releasing hits like “Parents Just
Don’t Understand” and “Summer Time”,

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:48.000
NBC decided to make a sitcom loosely based
on Smith’s life.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.469
In the early years of The Fresh Prince of
Bel-Air, it was apparent that Smith was unsure

00:02:51.469 --> 00:02:55.400
how to hit a mark or how to avoid mouthing
other actor’s lines but he pushed through

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.019
and became not only a television star but
a monumental movie star.

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:03.510
The 90s brought the box office hits like Independence
Day and Men in Black, but the 2000s brought

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:06.480
the critical acclaim with Ali and The Pursuit
of Happyness.

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.709
Smith still occasionally releases music but
barely compared to his serious dedication

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:11.709
to acting.

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:15.209
Since he is able churn out one exceptional
performance after another, the kid from Philly

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:21.709
can do whatever he wants.

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:25.030
Meat Loaf
Meat Loaf is known for his powerful voice

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:26.510
and theatrical music.

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:30.900
In the early 1970s he debuted as the beefy
musician with a funny name and a dramatic

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:31.900
musical presence.

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:36.060
The 70s and 80s were a time of exploring his
acting bug with his first film, appropriately

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:39.709
a musical, The Rocky Horror Picture Show and
a few supporting roles in smaller films.

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:44.090
Meatloaf began racking up film credits in
the 1990s with solid performances in Black

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:45.790
Dog, The Mighty and Fight Club.

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:50.629
He has only since gathered more acting work
with no signs of quitting.

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:55.889
Ludacris
Musician turned actor Ludacris was a case

00:03:55.889 --> 00:03:59.049
of someone being far too charming to only
stick to the airwaves.

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:03.599
Ludacris first emerged in the late 90s as
a rapper and his popularity only grew in the

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:04.599
early 2000s.

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:08.430
His career took a turn for the best with acting
roles in 2 Fast 2 Furious, Hustle and Flow

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:09.430
and Crash.

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:13.709
Ludacris takes on mostly supporting roles
in ensemble films but still manages to stand

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:15.310
out amongst a cast of bigger names.

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:18.180
He found a home with the Fast films as the
mouthy Tej Parker cementing his likability

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:19.540
as a supporting player.

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:23.960
Ludacris continues to release music regularly
but his acting has given him a name for those

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:24.960
who were unaware of his music.

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:28.460
He may not be as major of an actor as some
of the others on our list, but to say that

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:35.419
the man isn’t talented would just be ludicrous.

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:38.270
Justin Timberlake
With his ramen noodle hairstyle and loose

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:42.030
fitting white tank top, there was a time when
Justin Timberlake was every tweens favorite

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:43.250
member of Nsync.

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:46.082
Even before he was a mousketeer on The New
Mickey Mouse Club where he was singing his

00:04:46.082 --> 00:04:47.480
prepubescent heart out, he was testing the
waters of acting.

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:49.889
Once Timberlake went solo, he not only proved
what everyone knew to be true, he was a legitimate

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:53.210
musician amongst a sea of boy bad members
of the late 90s.

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:56.990
Taking the music world by storm was not enough
for Timberlake, it was time to dive back into

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:59.740
the acting world and somehow he accomplished
it with great aplomb.

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:03.430
From his devastating performance in Alpha
Dog, to his cocky role in The Social Network

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:07.270
to Friends with Benefits which confirmed his
ability to play an impeccable romantic lead.

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:11.090
Timberlake’s ability to jump back and forth
between acting and singing is justified by

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:15.120
his talent.

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:19.169
Cher
Cher started her career as a solo artist in

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:22.889
the mid-1960s performing many covers and gracing
the Billboard charts.

00:05:22.889 --> 00:05:26.060
It was her pairing with Sonny Bono that helped
her rise to pop stardom.

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:29.990
The duo had already been a married for a while,
as Cher was a teenage bride, when they released

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:33.750
the smash hit “I Got You Babe” a song
that is still considered one of the best pop

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:34.750
songs ever.

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:39.290
After a few iterations of Sonny and Cher variety
shows, and a few popular solo albums, Cher

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:40.890
went the acting route in the 1980s.

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:45.139
Her work in Silkwood, Moonstruck and Mask
made it obvious that she was more than just

00:05:45.139 --> 00:05:49.430
a talented singer, the diva was a fantastic
actress who holds audience’s attention every

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:54.610
time she is onscreen.

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:57.810
Jennifer Hudson
Compared to the other artists on our list,

00:05:57.810 --> 00:05:59.990
Jennifer Hudson is a relatively new performer.

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:03.920
She was first introduced to audiences showing
off her phenomenal voice on American Idol.

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:07.580
Despite the fact that she only came in 7th
place on the reality competition show, she

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:10.500
has become one of the most successful contestants
in the show’s history.

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:14.210
Her soulful voice was not her only talent
but it certainly helped her get an integral

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:16.639
role in the film adaptation of Dreamgirls.

00:06:16.639 --> 00:06:20.199
She belted out familiar songs while demonstrating
her natural acting talent.

00:06:20.199 --> 00:06:24.370
That first acting gig not only earned her
an Academy Award but a multitude of other

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:25.370
accolades.

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:29.919
Hudson continues to show off her acting chops
in films and has segued to stage, making her

00:06:29.919 --> 00:06:32.419
Broadway debut in the revival of The Color
Purple.

00:06:32.419 --> 00:06:39.550
Jennifer Hudson’s career is evidence that
losing can sometimes lead to winning.

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:42.729
Mark Wahlberg
As much as Mark Wahlberg may want everyone

00:06:42.729 --> 00:06:47.150
to forget about his musical career, he actually
did hit the Billboard charts twice back when

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:49.260
he was part of Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch.

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:53.110
Wahlberg made his departure from mediocre
rapper to accomplished actor with small roles

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:57.940
in The Basketball Diaries opposite Leonardo
DiCaprio and quickly landed a lead role in

00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:01.189
1996’s Fear as the demented boyfriend of
Reese Witherspoon.

00:07:01.189 --> 00:07:04.700
His performance was memorable but it was his
role as Dirk Diggler in Boogie Nights that

00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:07.020
made everyone forget about his pants-dropping
earlier career routine.

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:10.930
Wahlberg has proven himself as a strong actor
since then and while he probably shouldn’t

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:14.979
be embarrassed about his music past, audiences
are certainly pleased he traded in his mic

00:07:14.979 --> 00:07:16.860
for an acting chair.

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:17.860
There you have it.

00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:18.860
What do you think of our list?

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:19.860
Who did we forget?
