00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:13.530
Although the phrase “mad as a hatter”
is, and will likely long be, associated with

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:19.010
Charles Dodgson’s (a.k.a. Lewis Carroll’s)
1865 novel, Alice in Wonderland, contrary

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:23.849
to popular belief, Carroll neither coined
the phrase nor did he use it in his works.

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:28.140
(The Hatter is referred to as “mad”, along
with his little tea party, but he is never

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.270
explicitly called “Mad Hatter” in Carroll’s
works nor is the phrase “mad as a hatter”

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:34.270
used.)

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:36.700
So where did the phrase “mad as a hatter”
actually come from?

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:42.560
The first documented instance of the phrase
can be found in the 1829 short story, Noctes

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:45.920
Ambrocianæ, published in Blackwood’s Edinburgh
Magazine:

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:51.050
NORTH: Many years – I was Sultan of Bello
for a long period, until dethroned by an act

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:56.120
of the grossest injustice; but I intend to
expose the traitorous conspirators to the

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.120
indignation of an outraged world.

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.290
TICKLER (aside to SHEPHERD.): He’s raving.

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:04.379
SHEPHERD (to TICKLER.): Dementit.

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.070
ODOHERTY (to both.): Mad as a hatter.

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:08.880
Hand me a segar.

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:14.230
The next known documented instance of it appears
in the 1835 work The Clockmaker, by Canadian

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:16.340
Thomas Chandler Haliburton:

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:21.580
And with that he turned right round, and sat
down to his map and never said another word,

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:25.060
lookin’ as mad as a hatter the whole blessed
time…

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:30.030
(And later in the same work) Father he larfed
out like any thing; I thought he would never

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:35.100
stop – and sister Sall got right up and
walked out of the room, as mad as a hatter.

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.920
Says she, Sam, I do believe you are a born
fool, I vow.

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.200
The leading theory as to the origin of the
phrase is that it refers to a genuine condition

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:49.330
that began afflicting certain hat makers in
the 17th century called “mad hatters’

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:51.270
syndrome” or “hatters’ shakes”.

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.260
The symptoms associated with this condition
were first described in full detail in 1829

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:00.780
by a Russian physician, the same year the
first known instance of the expression came

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:01.780
about.

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:06.030
It continued to be a problem for hat makers
through the 19th century in much of the Western

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.610
world, though in the U.S. it was a phenomenon
that continued into the mid-20th century for

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:12.660
reasons we’ll get into in a bit.

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:17.959
As to the underlying cause of mad hatters’
syndrome, in the 17th century in France, expensive

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:22.090
hats made of felt began being produced using
mercury nitrate.

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:26.500
The method in question seems to have been
developed by the Huguenots of France who,

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:31.740
after Louis XIV revoked the Edict of Nantes
in 1685, which had previously given them certain

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:35.950
religious freedoms and rights, were forced
to flee to Britain where they soon shared

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:40.510
their little trade secret with British hatters,
with it spreading from there.

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:45.200
The specific felt production method here was
to use mercury nitrate in a solution used

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:50.590
to strip fur from animal skin (usually from
a rabbit or beaver) in a process known as

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:54.680
“carroting”, so called because of the
orange-ish colour of the mercury-nitrate solution.

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:55.680
(Aside: before the 17th century, carrots were
predominantly purple, not orange.)

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.540
The specific benefit to the mercury nitrate
here was to cause the stiffer outer hairs

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.700
to soften and become limp, allowing the hatters
to pack them together more easily.

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:08.940
After carrotting, the resulting matted fur
was shrunk in boiling water and then dried.

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:13.640
The processed felt subsequently used for hat
making continued to emit mercury vapour for

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:15.690
some time after carrotting.

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:19.780
Hat makers rarely wore any kind of safety
equipment or protective clothing back then

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:24.250
and often worked in cramped, extremely poorly
ventilated work spaces.

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:29.250
Because of this, invariably they were exposed
to dangerous amounts of mercury vapours during

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:35.050
their day to day lives, culminating in prevalent
mercury poisoning among those in the industry.

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:40.099
The symptoms of mercury poisoning are numerous
and in many cases extremely severe, affecting

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:45.910
the heart, brain, lungs, kidneys and in some
cases, the immune system, among other things.

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:50.760
Most pertinent to the topic at hand, neurological
symptoms associated with mercury poisoning

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:55.850
can include, but are not limited to, abnormal
sensations in the limbs, muscle tremors, erratic

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:58.670
mood changes and mental deterioration.

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:03.540
The behaviour of those afflicted by mercury
poisoning is usually typified by anxiety,

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:07.870
extreme timidness and a general desire to
remain “unobserved”, usually responding

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:11.640
with anger or irritability if this wish is
ignored.

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:16.500
Back in the halcyon days of the 18th and 19th
century when these symptoms were seen simply

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:21.959
as a necessary aspect of making nice hats,
instead of a debilitating, avoidable health

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:26.389
concern, people simply referred to the condition
as the “hatters’ shakes” with little

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:31.520
effort initially being expended to discover
the underlying cause.

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:35.639
Over in America, hat makers didn’t fare
any better, with those suffering from what

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:40.610
medical literature would later more accurately
define as “mercurial tremors” experiencing

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:45.840
a similar amount of apathy towards fixing
or preventing the problem being demonstrated.

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:49.469
The condition was also known to some in the
1850s as the “Danbury Shakes”, Danbury

00:04:49.469 --> 00:04:53.819
being the largest hat-making town in America
at the time.

00:04:53.819 --> 00:04:58.389
In 1860, a treatise on common ailments that
seemed to affect a large percentage of New

00:04:58.389 --> 00:05:05.289
Jersey hatters was written by physician Addison
Freeman, titled Mercurial Disease Among Hatters,

00:05:05.289 --> 00:05:09.030
published in the Transactions of Medical Society
of New Jersey.

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:13.099
Freeman noted in the paper (which was completely
ignored by the local industry),

00:05:13.099 --> 00:05:17.029
A proper regard for the health of this class
of citizens demands that mercury should not

00:05:17.029 --> 00:05:21.969
be used so extensively in the manufacture
of hats, and that if its use is essential,

00:05:21.969 --> 00:05:27.150
that the hat finishers’ room should be large,
with a high ceiling, and well ventilated.

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:31.160
One year later, Adolph Kussmaul wrote at length
about the symptoms of mercury poisoning in

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:35.250
1861, including briefly mentioning hatters
in the work.

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:40.129
As a result of mercury now correctly being
identified as the culprit behind mad hatters’

00:05:40.129 --> 00:05:43.879
syndrome, alternate methods of processing
the fur were developed over the following

00:05:43.879 --> 00:05:44.990
decades.

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:49.850
This resulted in mercury being phased out
of the production of felt hats in places like

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:54.139
France and Britain by the end of the 19th
century (even by law in France), but not in

00:05:54.139 --> 00:05:55.619
the United States.

00:05:55.619 --> 00:05:59.740
As one report in the Bureau of Statistic of
Labor and Industries of New Jersey noted in

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:03.319
1890 concerning the conditions at hatter workshops:

00:06:03.319 --> 00:06:08.139
The surprise is that men can be induced to
work at all in such death producing enclosures.

00:06:08.139 --> 00:06:13.240
It is hard to believe that men of ordinary
intelligence could be so indifferent to the

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:14.759
ordinary laws of health…

00:06:14.759 --> 00:06:19.659
It does not seem to have occurred to them
that all the efforts to keep up wages… [are]

00:06:19.659 --> 00:06:24.229
largely offset by the impairment of their
health, due to neglect of proper hygienic

00:06:24.229 --> 00:06:26.460
regulations of their workshops…

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:30.589
And when the fact of the workmen in the sizing
room, who stand in water, was mentioned, and

00:06:30.589 --> 00:06:35.229
the simple and inexpensive means by which
it could be largely avoided was spoken of,

00:06:35.229 --> 00:06:40.319
the reply was that it would cost money and
hat manufacturers did not care to expend money

00:06:40.319 --> 00:06:43.210
for such purposes, if they could avoid it.

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:47.419
Another report, Chronic Mercury Poisoning,
noted of hatters in the 1940s,

00:06:47.419 --> 00:06:52.419
The man affected is easily upset and embarrassed,
loses all joy in life and lives in constant

00:06:52.419 --> 00:06:54.550
fear of being dismissed from his job.

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:58.020
He has a sense of timidity and may lose self
control before visitors.

00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:02.279
Thus, if one stops to watch such a man in
a factory, he will sometimes throw down his

00:07:02.279 --> 00:07:06.949
tools and turn in anger on the intruder, saying
he cannot work if watched.

00:07:06.949 --> 00:07:11.050
Occasionally a man is obliged to give up work
because he can no longer take orders without

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:15.449
losing his temper or, if he is a foreman,
because he has no patience with men under

00:07:15.449 --> 00:07:16.449
him.

00:07:16.449 --> 00:07:21.050
Drowsiness, depression, loss of memory and
insomnia may occur, but hallucinations, delusions

00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:22.469
and mania are rare.

00:07:22.469 --> 00:07:26.680
The most characteristic symptom, though it
is seldom the first to appear, is mercurial

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:27.680
tremor.

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:31.330
It is neither as fine nor as regular as that
of hyperthyroidism.

00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:34.300
It may be interrupted every few minutes by
coarse jerky movements.

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:39.090
It usually begins in the fingers, but the
eyelids, lips and tongue are affected early.

00:07:39.090 --> 00:07:43.150
As it progresses it passes to the arms and
legs, so that it becomes very difficult for

00:07:43.150 --> 00:07:47.310
a man to walk about the workshop, and he may
have to be guided to his bench.

00:07:47.310 --> 00:07:51.509
At this stage the condition is so obvious
that it is known to the layman as “hatter’s

00:07:51.509 --> 00:07:52.509
shakes.”

00:07:52.509 --> 00:07:56.599
Rampant mercury poisoning among hatters and
felt makers didn’t end in the United States

00:07:56.599 --> 00:07:57.849
until WW2.

00:07:57.849 --> 00:08:03.379
In 1941, the U.S. Public Health Service convened
a meeting with representatives from the felt

00:08:03.379 --> 00:08:07.469
and hat making industries to force them to
use an alternative method of felt production.

00:08:07.469 --> 00:08:11.889
While it may seem like they were doing this
only out of concern for the workers, in fact

00:08:11.889 --> 00:08:15.289
they had long known about this particular
problem within this industry.

00:08:15.289 --> 00:08:19.689
The real impetus for finally doing something
about it was to conserve mercury for use in

00:08:19.689 --> 00:08:24.190
the war, with a side benefit being better
working conditions for felt producers.

00:08:24.190 --> 00:08:28.649
With the push, the industry representatives
agreed to switch to using a different, well-known

00:08:28.649 --> 00:08:33.000
method of felt production using prevalent
and cheap hydrogen peroxide.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:37.190
In any event, Lewis Carroll would have been
well aware of the symptoms of mad hatters’

00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:41.280
syndrome, as he grew up in Stockport, one
of the major hat making hubs of England at

00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:42.280
the time.

00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:46.390
Nevertheless, seemingly intentionally, Carroll’s
Hatter, while a bit of an oddball, does not

00:08:46.390 --> 00:08:51.380
portray the typical symptoms associated with
mercury poisoning, such as extreme shyness,

00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:55.370
shakes, loss of self-confidence, and timidness
to an excessive degree.

00:08:55.370 --> 00:08:59.600
This type of behavior couldn’t contrast
more with the exuberant and jovial personality

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:04.110
of the character, a fact that probably wasn’t
lost on Carroll’s original audience.

00:09:04.110 --> 00:09:07.830
Later, Carroll further injects a little subtle
reference to the syndrome when the King of

00:09:07.830 --> 00:09:11.960
Hearts tells the Hatter not to be nervous,
a seemingly uncontrollable trait of “mad

00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:15.500
hatters” of the day, lest he execute him
on the spot.

00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:19.110
It has also been speculated (with no hard
evidence to back this notion up, so take this

00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:23.970
with a very large grain of salt) that Carroll
based the character on Theophilus Carter,

00:09:23.970 --> 00:09:28.810
a noteworthy furniture dealer who lived at
48 High Street, Oxford while Carroll was an

00:09:28.810 --> 00:09:29.810
Oxford don.

00:09:29.810 --> 00:09:33.690
Carter was considered something of an eccentric
who, according to the British Medical Journal,

00:09:33.690 --> 00:09:38.040
is known to have been called “the mad hatter”,
presumably referencing his oddball behavior

00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:43.050
and the fact that he purportedly almost always
went around wearing a large top hat.

00:09:43.050 --> 00:09:47.240
Pertinent to the topic at hand, Theophilus
once invented a particularly useful alarm

00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:51.910
clock (presented at the Great Exhibition in
Hyde Park in 1851) that, at the appropriate

00:09:51.910 --> 00:09:56.800
time, would tip the bed over, unceremoniously
dumping the sleeping occupant on the floor.

00:09:56.800 --> 00:10:01.740
It has been speculated, again with zero documented
evidence backing the idea up, that this particular

00:10:01.740 --> 00:10:06.400
invention inspired Carroll a little over a
decade later to make the Hatter obsessed with

00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:10.380
time in Alice and Wonderland.

00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:14.130
If mercury poisoning wasn’t enough, New
Jersey hatters in the late 19th century had

00:10:14.130 --> 00:10:18.900
another major ailment to contend with due
to the extremely poor working conditions they

00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:20.460
were made to endure- tuberculosis.

00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:27.200
In fact, nearly 2/3 of hatters in New Jersey
were dead of a pulmonary disease by 30 years

00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:28.200
old.

00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:32.370
The rates of mercury poisoning among this
same group was reported as high as 50%, with

00:10:32.370 --> 00:10:36.970
this number thought to be low given that many
workers would attempt to mask their symptoms

00:10:36.970 --> 00:10:38.870
for fear of losing their jobs.

00:10:38.870 --> 00:10:43.210
In the 1930s, the U.S. Public Health Service
reported the condition appearing in a whopping

00:10:43.210 --> 00:11:01.399
80% of all felt makers.
