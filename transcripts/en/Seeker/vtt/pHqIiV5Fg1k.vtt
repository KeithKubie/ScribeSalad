00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:05.069
IUDs are one of the safest, most effective
forms of birth control out there - so why

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:08.440
aren’t more people using them?

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:15.849
Hey guys, Tara here for Dnews - and it’s
always a fun day when I get to talk about

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:18.750
something I truly, firmly believe in.

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.920
Today, that thing is the IUD.

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:25.320
IUD stands for intrauterine device, and it’s
a birth control method that’s been around

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:26.690
since the 60s.

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:31.289
It’s currently the most popular form of
contraception in China, and many other countries

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.399
around the world - but for some reason, it
hasn’t really caught on here in America.

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:42.079
That may soon change, though, as the American
Academy of Pediatrics just labeled the IUD

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:45.930
the number one choice for contraceptive use
in teens.

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.020
So what makes it so great?

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.220
And why is almost nobody in the western world
using them?

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:52.620
Let’s start with the basics.

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.100
Here in the US, there are 2 different kinds
of IUDs.

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.350
There’s copper, and then there’s hormonal.

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:03.530
Both of them look like little T-shaped devices
that get inserted into your uterus.

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:05.690
Copper IUDs basically work like a spermicide.

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:10.550
They release copper ions into your system,
which damage incoming sperm - preventing them

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:12.380
from joining with an egg.

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:16.610
Hormonal IUDs, on the other hand, release
very small amounts of progestin into your

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:21.160
system, which thickens your cervical mucus
to the point where sperm cannot penetrate

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:22.160
it.

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:26.610
In some women, they can actually inhibit ovulation
- which significantly decreases both the frequency

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.580
and duration of your periods.

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:33.720
Some women stop menstruating almost entirely
- unlike copper IUDs, which can actually increase

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:34.720
menstrual bleeding.

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:38.940
Still, a lot of women prefer the copper ones,
because they don’t have hormones - and because

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:43.630
they last 10 years - unlike hormonal IUDs,
which only 3-5 years.

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:46.310
That’s actually part of the reason doctors
recommend them.

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:50.380
You implant it once, and then you don’t
have to worry about it for several years.

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:52.510
So there’s basically no room for human error.

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:55.790
Especially with teens, who can be forgetful.

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:58.850
Another reason doctors like them - is that
they’re incredibly effective.

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:04.290
A 2012 study labeled them the most effective
form of birth control out there - and 20 times

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.290
more effective than the pill or the patch.

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:09.640
But if they’re really so great, then why
aren’t more people using them?

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:11.580
Well, there’s a few reasons for that.

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.110
One, is that a lot of women simply don’t
know about them - whereas everyone’s heard

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:16.110
of the pill.

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.470
But there are also a lot of misconceptions
surrounding IUDs.

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:23.310
A common one, is that they’re dangerous
- which stems from a particular brand in the

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:28.230
70s called the Dalkon Shield, that ended up
being recalled after it was linked to a number

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.570
of deaths from septic miscarriages.

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:34.980
Turns out, it was due to a faulty design - and
today’s devices have never been linked to

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.290
anything like that.

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:41.990
That said, there is evidence that women with
IUDs who contract STDs - and in particular,

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:47.060
chlamydia - are at increased risk for Pelvic
Inflammatory Disease, which can lead to infertility.

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:52.180
That’s why all doctors are required to order
thorough STD screenings before inserting them

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:57.200
- and many won’t even consider giving IUDs
to women who aren’t in monogamous relationships.

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.540
Some doctors also don’t wanna give them
to women who haven’t had children - because

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:05.430
they’re afraid of being sued by women who
mistakenly believe their infertility was caused

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:08.790
by an IUD, when in fact - they were infertile
all along.

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:14.400
So even though studies show that the risk
of an IUD causing infertility is almost nonexistent,

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.350
some doctors just prefer to play it safe.

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:20.980
Still, it’s kinda tough to argue with something
that A) lasts several years, B)

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:25.490
saves you thousands of dollars in the long
run, C) is more effective than any other birth

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:28.220
control out there, and D) is virtually worry-free.

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:33.250
At the risk of giving too much information,
all I’ll say - is that I have one, and I

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:35.810
will never, ever use anything else.

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:36.810
It’s awesome.

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:38.740
Enough about me though, what do you guys think?

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:39.880
Would you get an IUD?

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:42.320
And if you have one already, what do you think
of it?

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:45.470
