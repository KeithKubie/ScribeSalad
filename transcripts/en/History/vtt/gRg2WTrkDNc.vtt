00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:07.960
NARRATOR: Egypt, Valley of the
Kings. November 4th,1922.

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:11.380
A young boy working for
a British excavation team

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:13.710
led by Howard Carter.

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.040
He's riding his
donkey home one night

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:19.620
when suddenly, the animal's
hoofs slips into a hole

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:22.250
below the sand.

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:25.710
Thinking he may have stumbled
upon the entrance to a tomb,

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.750
he rushes home
and alerts Carter.

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.080
[suspenseful music]

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.920
RAMY ROMANY: When
Howard Carter came in,

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:40.210
they dumped feverishly all the
way through the tomb, 72 steps

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:44.750
till they reached the sealed
door of the tomb, which

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:47.330
was right here.

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:51.170
He instantly made a hole into
the wall before destroying it.

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.080
And Howard Carter
peeked in and said,

00:00:54.080 --> 00:01:00.670
and I quote, "I see wonderful
things," which was very true.

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:05.620
Right inside King Tut's tomb,
there were wonderful things.

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:10.920
This tomb was packed
with gold and treasures.

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.620
NARRATOR: Incredibly,
Howard Carter and his team

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:18.580
had unearthed the tomb
of King Tutankhamun.

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:21.250
To this day, it is
considered the best

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:24.920
preserved and most
intact tomb ever found

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:25.960
in the Valley of the Kings.

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:33.080
Although the excavation
team achieved

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:36.620
instant worldwide fame
for their discovery,

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:40.080
their triumph was short-lived.

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:45.000
During the opening of
the tomb of King Tut,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.830
all the workers were
very wary, the Egyptians.

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:53.170
It is known that
ancient Egyptian tombs

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:56.670
have the curse of the pharaohs.

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.460
Whoever enters the
tomb first will die.

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.670
[suspenseful music]

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.250
NARRATOR: While most
Westerners involved

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.120
did not take the ancient
stories of a curse seriously,

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:12.620
the opening of King Tut's
tomb was almost immediately

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:17.290
followed by numerous tragedies,
some with eerie connections

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:18.620
to the alleged curse.

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.080
[suspenseful music]

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.290
Soon after the
opening of the tomb,

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:26.540
a messenger went to
the archaeologist

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.620
houses was Howard Carter.

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:33.710
He found Carter's beloved
canary in the mouth

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:40.210
of a cobra, which was the
symbolic snake of the pharaoh.

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:43.460
Later, we learned that
Lord Carnarvon himself was

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:46.880
a bit on the cheek by a
mosquito in the very same place

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:51.210
that King Tut, it turned
out, was also wounded.

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:54.000
He died within weeks of
a blood-borne disease

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.380
very mysteriously.

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:58.500
Howard Fields,
another archaeologist,

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.670
who came to the tomb, had his
home burned down and flooded.

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.380
And people began to
wonder if, in fact, this

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:06.040
was the curse of Tutankhamun.

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.710
[suspenseful music]

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:11.380
NARRATOR: No fewer
than seven deaths

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:14.670
have been associated with
the opening of the tomb,

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:18.420
the same number of lives
that Oak Island must claim,

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.830
according to the legend.

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:22.670
Could there really
have been a curse

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:25.670
protecting King Tut's tomb?

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:29.880
And if so, what was behind it?

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:36.330
Curses were a tool of
heka, the magical technology

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:40.210
that the Egyptians used
that they said was a gift

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:43.080
of their extraterrestrial gods.

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:45.000
This suggests that the
curse of the pharaohs

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.750
is an extraterrestrial force,
or perhaps, even technology

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:51.580
that the ancient
Egyptians were utilizing

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:52.540
to protect these tombs.

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:55.380
[suspenseful music]

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:57.580
NARRATOR: Is it
possible that some type

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:02.120
of extraterrestrial technology
was activated with the opening

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:04.920
of King Tut's Tomb?

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:07.960
Ancient astronaut
theorists say yes,

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:12.290
and its further evidence point
to the so-called magic bricks

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:13.250
found at the tomb.

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:15.120
[suspenseful music]

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:20.080
In the tomb of
Tutankhamun was four bricks

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:25.460
in the four cardinal positions
with some magical spells

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:29.210
from chapter 151 of
the "Book of the Dead."

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:31.920
Spells of protecting the dead.

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:33.250
They believed in magic.

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:35.500
They believed in the
power of the words.

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:38.500
The word for them makes
power, makes protection.

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:40.670
[suspenseful music]

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:44.830
When we go over to
the Tibetan arena,

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:46.500
we see these prayer wheels.

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:49.000
And this is a very interesting
thing, because the priest

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.420
would actually go by.

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:52.830
And they would roll
these cylindrical drums

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:54.460
with their hands.

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:57.620
And they believe that the
simple rolling of the drum

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:01.620
would actually impress the words
upon the space around them.

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:04.500
They believed that space
was alive and intelligent.

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:08.250
So this suggest the
possibility that certain words

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:12.460
do, in a sense, become
imbued with a force.

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:14.540
That force may be something
that certain types

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:17.460
of extraterrestrial or
extradimensional beings

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:20.620
can actually access.

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:23.670
Is it possible that the
Egyptians were working

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:28.120
with extraterrestrials who
would, in fact, generate

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:33.040
these types of seemingly
magical phenomena in the event

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:36.040
that people tried to transgress
into these locations?
