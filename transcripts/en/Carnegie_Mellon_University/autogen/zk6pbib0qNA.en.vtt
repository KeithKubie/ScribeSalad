funding and this is the time when
 

00:32:21.429 --> 00:32:23.220
funding and this is the time when
pittsburgh was going through his crisis

00:32:23.220 --> 00:32:23.230
pittsburgh was going through his crisis
 

00:32:23.230 --> 00:32:25.049
pittsburgh was going through his crisis
and there was hardly any VC funding over

00:32:25.049 --> 00:32:25.059
and there was hardly any VC funding over

dollars created about 50 jobs over here
 

00:32:32.290 --> 00:32:37.380
dollars created about 50 jobs over here
and then I left super excited the

00:32:37.380 --> 00:32:37.390
and then I left super excited the
 

00:32:37.390 --> 00:32:39.570
and then I left super excited the
company from scratch and we built up the

00:32:39.570 --> 00:32:39.580
company from scratch and we built up the
 

00:32:39.580 --> 00:32:44.159

years ago pretty much in the fourth

00:33:02.850 --> 00:33:02.860
years ago pretty much in the fourth
 

00:33:02.860 --> 00:33:04.980
years ago pretty much in the fourth
quarter of super bowl we signed a

00:33:04.980 --> 00:33:04.990
quarter of super bowl we signed a
 

00:33:04.990 --> 00:33:06.690
quarter of super bowl we signed a
contract to solve that division of the

00:33:06.690 --> 00:33:06.700
contract to solve that division of the
 

00:33:06.700 --> 00:33:08.610
contract to solve that division of the
company so that got sold that day and

00:33:08.610 --> 00:33:08.620
company so that got sold that day and
 

00:33:08.620 --> 00:33:10.730
company so that got sold that day and
steelers won that day so that work out

00:33:10.730 --> 00:33:10.740
steelers won that day so that work out
 

00:33:10.740 --> 00:33:13.110
steelers won that day so that work out
it's a good day it has good

00:33:13.110 --> 00:33:13.120
it's a good day it has good
 

00:33:13.120 --> 00:33:15.480
it's a good day it has good
so out of that they said you know we got

00:33:15.480 --> 00:33:15.490
so out of that they said you know we got
 

00:33:15.490 --> 00:33:16.710
so out of that they said you know we got
to do something we got this very

00:33:16.710 --> 00:33:16.720
to do something we got this very
 

00:33:16.720 --> 00:33:17.880
to do something we got this very
interesting technology called

00:33:17.880 --> 00:33:17.890
interesting technology called
 

00:33:17.890 --> 00:33:20.160
interesting technology called
supercritical fluids which is you know

00:33:20.160 --> 00:33:20.170
supercritical fluids which is you know
 

00:33:20.170 --> 00:33:22.380
supercritical fluids which is you know
user co2 which you and I breathe in and

00:33:22.380 --> 00:33:22.390
user co2 which you and I breathe in and
 

00:33:22.390 --> 00:33:24.200
user co2 which you and I breathe in and
breathe out so it's considered organic

00:33:24.200 --> 00:33:24.210
breathe out so it's considered organic
 

00:33:24.210 --> 00:33:26.370
breathe out so it's considered organic
physiologically compatible zero

pollution no air no water no solid

00:33:28.410 --> 00:33:28.420
pollution no air no water no solid
 

00:33:28.420 --> 00:33:30.600
pollution no air no water no solid
pollution and we decided to focus on the

00:33:30.600 --> 00:33:30.610
pollution and we decided to focus on the
 

00:33:30.610 --> 00:33:33.000
pollution and we decided to focus on the
energy side so last year we spun out the

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:33.010
energy side so last year we spun out the
 

00:33:33.010 --> 00:33:35.549
energy side so last year we spun out the
new company called her energy and the

00:33:35.549 --> 00:33:35.559
new company called her energy and the
 

00:33:35.559 --> 00:33:37.080
new company called her energy and the
first thing that we focus on this

00:33:37.080 --> 00:33:37.090
first thing that we focus on this
 

00:33:37.090 --> 00:33:40.020
first thing that we focus on this
geothermal and when I say geothermal I'm

00:33:40.020 --> 00:33:40.030
geothermal and when I say geothermal I'm
 

00:33:40.030 --> 00:33:41.549
geothermal and when I say geothermal I'm
not talking parts in generation I'm

00:33:41.549 --> 00:33:41.559
not talking parts in generation I'm
 

00:33:41.559 --> 00:33:43.980
not talking parts in generation I'm
talking ground source heat pumps the

00:33:43.980 --> 00:33:43.990
talking ground source heat pumps the
 

00:33:43.990 --> 00:33:45.720
talking ground source heat pumps the
reason we are interested in that is if

00:33:45.720 --> 00:33:45.730
reason we are interested in that is if
 

00:33:45.730 --> 00:33:47.280
reason we are interested in that is if
you look at all the energy in the u.s.

00:33:47.280 --> 00:33:47.290
you look at all the energy in the u.s.
 

00:33:47.290 --> 00:33:49.680
you look at all the energy in the u.s.
thirty percent of our energy goes to

00:33:49.680 --> 00:33:49.690
thirty percent of our energy goes to
 

00:33:49.690 --> 00:33:51.510
thirty percent of our energy goes to
heat and cool these buildings that's a

00:33:51.510 --> 00:33:51.520
heat and cool these buildings that's a
 

00:33:51.520 --> 00:33:53.910
heat and cool these buildings that's a
lot of energy and it takes a lot of

00:33:53.910 --> 00:33:53.920
lot of energy and it takes a lot of
 

00:33:53.920 --> 00:33:56.549
lot of energy and it takes a lot of
infrastructure to deliver this energy so

00:33:56.549 --> 00:33:56.559
infrastructure to deliver this energy so
 

00:33:56.559 --> 00:33:58.230
infrastructure to deliver this energy so
what best you can do is if you can

00:33:58.230 --> 00:33:58.240
what best you can do is if you can
 

00:33:58.240 --> 00:34:00.570
what best you can do is if you can
reduce this energy consumption even five

00:34:00.570 --> 00:34:00.580
reduce this energy consumption even five
 

00:34:00.580 --> 00:34:02.160
reduce this energy consumption even five
percent it will have a significant

00:34:02.160 --> 00:34:02.170
percent it will have a significant
 

00:34:02.170 --> 00:34:03.780
percent it will have a significant
effect not only you become more

00:34:03.780 --> 00:34:03.790
effect not only you become more
 

00:34:03.790 --> 00:34:06.030
effect not only you become more
efficient but all the billions of

00:34:06.030 --> 00:34:06.040
efficient but all the billions of
 

00:34:06.040 --> 00:34:07.500
efficient but all the billions of
dollars that you have to spend to bring

00:34:07.500 --> 00:34:07.510
dollars that you have to spend to bring
 

00:34:07.510 --> 00:34:08.970
dollars that you have to spend to bring
additional energies are the

00:34:08.970 --> 00:34:08.980
additional energies are the
 

00:34:08.980 --> 00:34:10.950
additional energies are the
infrastructures the grid lines and the

00:34:10.950 --> 00:34:10.960
infrastructures the grid lines and the
 

00:34:10.960 --> 00:34:12.960
infrastructures the grid lines and the
pipelines if you can reduce that that
