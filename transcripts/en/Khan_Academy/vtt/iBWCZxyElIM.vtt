00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.886
- [Instructor] In the
last video, we started

00:00:01.886 --> 00:00:04.814
with the story of the
Patriarchs in Genesis.

00:00:04.814 --> 00:00:08.530
How Abraham settles his people in Canaan,

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:12.075
but eventually they get enslaved in Egypt.

00:00:12.075 --> 00:00:14.586
According to the Old Testament,
that enslavement lasts

00:00:14.586 --> 00:00:19.305
for over 500 years until we
have the emergence of Moses

00:00:19.305 --> 00:00:21.695
whom we also spoke
about in the last video.

00:00:21.695 --> 00:00:25.862
The next four books of the
Hebrew Bible which are often

00:00:26.711 --> 00:00:29.079
given authorship to Moses.

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:32.205
These really talk about Moses
freeing the Jewish people

00:00:32.205 --> 00:00:35.672
from enslavement,
getting the Commandments,

00:00:35.672 --> 00:00:39.839
the Law, from God, and
eventually bringing the people

00:00:40.768 --> 00:00:44.413
so that they can resettle back in Canaan.

00:00:44.413 --> 00:00:48.100
As I mentioned in the last
video, these first five books

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.787
of the Hebrew Bible,
also the first five books

00:00:50.787 --> 00:00:53.566
of the Christian Old
Testament, they are referred to

00:00:53.566 --> 00:00:57.993
as the Torah, and they are
given authorship to Moses

00:00:57.993 --> 00:01:01.192
although historians are doubtful of that.

00:01:01.192 --> 00:01:03.482
Even the historicity to
the degree to which these

00:01:03.482 --> 00:01:07.825
are historical characters
are significantly debated.

00:01:07.825 --> 00:01:09.946
We have the Jewish people,
according to Biblical accounts,

00:01:09.946 --> 00:01:11.750
now in Canaan.

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:14.681
As we go into the rest of
this video, we're getting into

00:01:14.681 --> 00:01:18.931
more of a historical period
with the first significant kings

00:01:18.931 --> 00:01:20.431
of the Israelites.

00:01:22.167 --> 00:01:26.932
Now we're getting into
the first millennium BCE.

00:01:26.932 --> 00:01:31.106
The people, the Israelites,
are settled in Canaan.

00:01:31.106 --> 00:01:35.273
In the 11th century, BCE you
have King Saul comes to power.

00:01:39.068 --> 00:01:41.574
He's considered to be the
first significant king,

00:01:41.574 --> 00:01:45.241
or the first king really
of a united kingdom

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:48.327
of Israel and Judah.

00:01:48.327 --> 00:01:49.749
This is King Saul.

00:01:49.749 --> 00:01:53.916
He is then succeeded by King
David who is his son-in-law.

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:58.106
It was a very continuous succession.

00:01:58.106 --> 00:02:00.478
David is considered a significant figure

00:02:00.478 --> 00:02:04.232
in Judaism and Christianity and Islam.

00:02:04.232 --> 00:02:07.705
He's considered a warrior,
poet, philosopher.

00:02:07.705 --> 00:02:11.499
He really strengthens and
really unifies the kingdom.

00:02:11.499 --> 00:02:15.457
He's succeeded by his son, King Solomon.

00:02:15.457 --> 00:02:20.225
King Solomon is famous in
Biblical accounts for his wisdom.

00:02:20.225 --> 00:02:24.392
He's also known for creating
the First Temple in Jerusalem.

00:02:26.179 --> 00:02:28.719
As we will see, this
First Temple in Jerusalem,

00:02:28.719 --> 00:02:31.375
the way that I have marked
it off on this timeline,

00:02:31.375 --> 00:02:34.663
the green is periods according
to Biblical accounts,

00:02:34.663 --> 00:02:37.199
then later according to
historical accounts as well.

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:41.366
When the Jewish people were
for the most part not in Canaan

00:02:42.934 --> 00:02:45.578
where they were in captivity,
or they were being enslaved.

00:02:45.578 --> 00:02:48.014
They were in exile some place else.

00:02:48.014 --> 00:02:49.809
The white that I show here,

00:02:49.809 --> 00:02:51.411
this is the enslavement in Egypt,

00:02:51.411 --> 00:02:53.899
this is going to be the
Babylonian captivity

00:02:53.899 --> 00:02:55.337
that we're going to talk about shortly.

00:02:55.337 --> 00:02:58.641
Then the white, this is
when we have the existence

00:02:58.641 --> 00:03:00.974
of the temples in Jerusalem.

00:03:02.594 --> 00:03:05.191
The First Temple in Jerusalem,
this is a depiction of it,

00:03:05.191 --> 00:03:06.941
was built by Solomon.

00:03:07.976 --> 00:03:12.143
Now the unified kingdoms Judah
and Israel don't last beyond

00:03:15.804 --> 00:03:17.791
these three kings.

00:03:17.791 --> 00:03:22.053
Shortly thereafter, it gets
fragmented into two kingdoms.

00:03:22.053 --> 00:03:26.273
The kingdom of Judah and
the kingdom of Israel.

00:03:26.273 --> 00:03:30.126
The kingdom of Israel
is going to be overrun

00:03:30.126 --> 00:03:34.293
by the Neo-Assyrians in 722
when they refuse to pay tribute

00:03:36.177 --> 00:03:38.260
to the Neo-Assyrian king.

00:03:39.901 --> 00:03:42.919
The kingdom of Judah essentially
becomes a client-state

00:03:42.919 --> 00:03:44.484
of the Assyrians.

00:03:44.484 --> 00:03:46.871
It's important to keep
in mind even though these

00:03:46.871 --> 00:03:49.224
are called kingdoms for
most of this history,

00:03:49.224 --> 00:03:51.662
they are client-states to larger powers

00:03:51.662 --> 00:03:54.183
whether it's the
Assyrians, the Babylonians,

00:03:54.183 --> 00:03:56.991
the Egyptians, the Seleucid.

00:03:56.991 --> 00:03:59.203
They keep being client-states.

00:03:59.203 --> 00:04:03.444
They also have some degree
of autonomy which is why

00:04:03.444 --> 00:04:05.922
they are called kingdoms.

00:04:05.922 --> 00:04:10.089
In 722, you have the kingdom
of Israel being overrun

00:04:11.521 --> 00:04:15.091
and many of the Jewish people
having to go into exile

00:04:15.091 --> 00:04:18.624
and being held captive
by the Neo-Assyrians.

00:04:18.624 --> 00:04:21.957
Then as we get into the 6th century BCE,

00:04:23.597 --> 00:04:27.165
you have the famous Babylonian Conquest,

00:04:27.165 --> 00:04:30.281
The Neo-Babylonian Conquest
of Nebuchadnezzar the Second,

00:04:30.281 --> 00:04:32.301
who conquers Judah.

00:04:32.301 --> 00:04:34.434
Once again, this is really a side battle

00:04:34.434 --> 00:04:37.654
between the Neo-Babylonians
and the Egyptians,

00:04:37.654 --> 00:04:40.162
and we talk about that in other videos.

00:04:40.162 --> 00:04:43.988
That takes us to the
Babylonian captivates.

00:04:43.988 --> 00:04:47.341
This is a picture here of Jerusalem,

00:04:47.341 --> 00:04:52.010
and maybe as equally important,
that First Temple of Solomon

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:54.702
being destroyed and the
Jewish people being taken

00:04:54.702 --> 00:04:57.302
into captivity where they are taken

00:04:57.302 --> 00:04:59.469
from Jerusalem to Babylon.

00:05:04.679 --> 00:05:08.031
They're held in captivity, a
significant fraction of them

00:05:08.031 --> 00:05:11.433
are held in captivity, in
Babylon from this period

00:05:11.433 --> 00:05:15.600
from around 597, 586 BCE
until Babylon is conquered

00:05:18.108 --> 00:05:22.403
by Cyrus the Great, conquered
by the Achaemenid Persians

00:05:22.403 --> 00:05:24.491
that we talk about in another video.

00:05:24.491 --> 00:05:27.909
Once again, the end of the
captivity is really a side effect

00:05:27.909 --> 00:05:31.361
of larger battles and conquests going on.

00:05:31.361 --> 00:05:36.260
But Cyrus the Great frees
the Jewish people in 538 BCE.

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:39.063
This is the end of the
Babylonian captivity.

00:05:39.063 --> 00:05:43.230
He resettles them back in
Jerusalem, and he and his successors

00:05:44.638 --> 00:05:47.829
assist in the rebuilding of the temple.

00:05:47.829 --> 00:05:51.734
Then you have the Second
Temple of Jerusalem.

00:05:51.734 --> 00:05:55.455
You often will hear Second Temple Judaism

00:05:55.455 --> 00:05:58.307
because this is the period
now where the Jewish people

00:05:58.307 --> 00:05:59.941
are resettled in Jerusalem.

00:05:59.941 --> 00:06:02.899
They are rebuilding that
Second Temple that a lot

00:06:02.899 --> 00:06:06.482
of the Old Testament
takes its modern form.

00:06:07.784 --> 00:06:10.430
Now this is going to last
for several hundred years.

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:14.180
As I mentioned the kingdom
of Judea is a client-state

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:15.795
of all of these various empires.

00:06:15.795 --> 00:06:19.167
It eventually becomes a
client-state of the Roman Empire

00:06:19.167 --> 00:06:23.334
as we get into the end of
the first millennium BCE.

00:06:26.844 --> 00:06:31.011
As we get to 70 CE, so this
is shortly after the time

00:06:32.069 --> 00:06:35.819
of Jesus, you have the
first Jewish-Roman War

00:06:37.601 --> 00:06:41.086
sometimes referred to
as the Jewish Revolt.

00:06:41.086 --> 00:06:44.919
In that, the Romans
destroy the Second Temple.

00:06:46.003 --> 00:06:48.711
This is really significant,
the Second Temple

00:06:48.711 --> 00:06:51.314
as we mentioned it starts getting rebuilt

00:06:51.314 --> 00:06:54.356
at the end of the captivity and famously

00:06:54.356 --> 00:06:57.987
gets really, nicely constructed as we get

00:06:57.987 --> 00:07:00.904
into the First Century BCE.

00:07:00.904 --> 00:07:03.709
Then in 70 CE, Jerusalem
is destroyed again.

00:07:03.709 --> 00:07:05.825
This time by the Romans.

00:07:05.825 --> 00:07:09.492
This is the beginning
of the Jewish Diaspora

00:07:11.545 --> 00:07:15.712
where they are exiled for,
now we're talking thousands

00:07:16.882 --> 00:07:19.074
of years, from Rome.

00:07:19.074 --> 00:07:22.041
They spread through the Roman
Empire and other empires,

00:07:22.041 --> 00:07:25.041
and we talk more about
that in other videos.

00:07:25.041 --> 00:07:27.829
This is a significant thing
because now the Jewish people

00:07:27.829 --> 00:07:30.837
are for the most part dispersed.

00:07:30.837 --> 00:07:34.881
They don't have a temple, and
you don't see a significant

00:07:34.881 --> 00:07:39.075
resettlement of the Jewish
people into this area

00:07:39.075 --> 00:07:41.825
until we get to the 20th century.
