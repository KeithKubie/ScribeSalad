00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:02.620
 From the time I and my beloved went to a party 

00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:04.640
 His old lover was present at the ceremony 

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:07.680
 He turned to me and asked me, "Did I know you?" 

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:12.300
 I answered him with all literature 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:13.820
 Why do not I expect my father to meet her? 

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:16.140
 Ok 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.420
 Because this subject was strange to me 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:21.220
 I mean, I do not meet my father Mo Moalishani immature 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:21.880
 I wish 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:24.140
 But why not meet someone you grew up with 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:27.760
 This is all my father I think about 

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:34.060
 Is it wrong that I am not friendly and I am surrounded by a strange attitude? 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:36.060
 Then fat we speak and absorbed .. 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.200
 Are you a friend of all your former granaries? 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.360
 I mean. Why Ante? 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:44.040
 Here. No. I'm Mani authenticated by one of them. no one. 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:45.480
 Absolutely 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.100
 Why do not you hate them? 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.600
 Not what I hate them. But I hope the first thing we separate disappear from existence 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.060
 I mean, they die 

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:54.180
 They shall be born from the foundation 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:56.420
 Ok this can be childlike 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:58.380
 But if we broke up !! I do not want to see you again 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:00.840
 I do not want to know about you Shi 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.620
 Perhaps this is because all my failures were bad 

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:08.920
 I do not once get a mature separation for what the parties are 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:12.200
 I love your person, but I think we are compatible 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.780
 Oh, I agree, I expect you are wonderful, but what we are attracted to 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:17.980
 I love to be friends 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:19.860
 But it will take time for Anasaki 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:20.840
 Sure, so am I. 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.060
 But, when I'm ready, I hope to be friends 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:26.980
 No 

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:28.980
 If the break was classical music 

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:30.640
 My break is loud music 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:32.760
 رااااار !! 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.400
 Tbe leave me !!? 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.060
 I did not ever run a girlfriend with a former lover 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:39.960
 Not once 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.560
 The fact that my lover is a constant friend with his granules 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.300
 Great food. honesty. 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:48.460
 WOW Explain to me your relationship? 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.880
 Such as when you see a new color, or you discover a new species 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:57.380
 So the idea that you got a friend was your lover .. 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.380
 Is a new concept for me 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:14.040
 My God! 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:15.420
 It is impossible to get. 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.480
 But, maybe I'm Mani's friend with my lover 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.520
 Because I was not his first friend 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:24.600
 All relationships start with romance 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.660
 It was a solid foundation for friendship 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.020
 I do not have time and prepared one of my friends 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:33.420
 And then we return friends 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.940
 But, who knows? 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:36.600
 I mean, are you a friend with a former lover? 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.480
 Or are you childlike like me and wish they 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:39.580
 They were not born from the foundation. 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:41.580
 I am an Akana, and stay great
