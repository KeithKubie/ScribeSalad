&gt;&gt;Daniel: I've always had this kind
of secret talk radio host fantasy,

00:00:13.226 --> 00:00:15.896
so I'm gonna play that
out this afternoon,

00:00:15.896 --> 00:00:19.846
and we have a great lineup here
on Castle Radio this afternoon,

00:00:20.296 --> 00:00:21.796
really outstanding guests.

00:00:22.446 --> 00:00:25.276
To my left, immediate
left, is Mark Greenberg.

00:00:25.316 --> 00:00:28.826
Mark is Edna Bennett chair of
prevention at Penn State University.

00:00:28.826 --> 00:00:31.086
He directs Penn State's
Prevention Research Center

00:00:31.656 --> 00:00:33.376
for the promotion of
human development.

00:00:33.676 --> 00:00:37.696
Maurice Elias is a professor of
psychology at Rutger's University,

00:00:37.696 --> 00:00:40.836
the president elect of the Society
for Community Research and Action.

00:00:41.186 --> 00:00:43.716
He's also the senior
author promoting social

00:00:43.716 --> 00:00:47.036
and emotional learning
guidelines for educators.

00:00:47.266 --> 00:00:50.306
Larry Abner, Larry's
professor of applied psychology

00:00:50.306 --> 00:00:52.376
and public policy at
New York University.

00:00:52.966 --> 00:00:56.696
There he serves as board
chair of the new Institute

00:00:56.696 --> 00:00:58.756
for Human Development
and Social Change.

00:00:59.116 --> 00:01:03.746
And finally, we have George
Lucas who needs no introduction,

00:01:03.746 --> 00:01:06.676
because he founded GLEF,
which we all worship.

00:01:06.766 --> 00:01:10.596
&gt;&gt;That's your claim to fame.

00:01:11.666 --> 00:01:14.706
&gt;&gt;Daniel: Because it's so effective
in getting the message out,

00:01:14.826 --> 00:01:18.096
so let me take people one by one.

00:01:18.096 --> 00:01:21.536
And first in the guest
chair is Mark Greenberg.

00:01:22.056 --> 00:01:25.636
So let's just start by
seeing where are we starting?

00:01:25.636 --> 00:01:28.916
What do you think the most
important scientific developments

00:01:28.946 --> 00:01:30.346
in SEL are so far?

00:01:30.656 --> 00:01:33.006
&gt;&gt;Mark: The message this
morning is critically important,

00:01:33.006 --> 00:01:36.096
and that is that social and
emotional learning programs

00:01:36.126 --> 00:01:40.346
in carefully done randomized trials
not only affect children's social

00:01:40.426 --> 00:01:42.406
development and their
emotional processing,

00:01:42.936 --> 00:01:45.256
but they dramatically affect
the academic achievement.

00:01:45.256 --> 00:01:47.866
This effect size of point
two eight is as large

00:01:47.866 --> 00:01:49.206
as almost any effect size.

00:01:49.506 --> 00:01:52.556
Even reading achievement
interventions don't change reading

00:01:52.556 --> 00:01:55.816
achievement in most cases more than
social emotional learning does.

00:01:55.816 --> 00:01:59.386
And that's because, as Dan said
many years ago, it's a master skill.

00:01:59.616 --> 00:02:02.276
It's a skill that underlies all
kinds of achievements in learning.

00:02:02.506 --> 00:02:05.856
You know that in the nineteen
eighties, an experiment was stopped

00:02:06.056 --> 00:02:08.606
because we found that aspirin,
by taking aspirin each day,

00:02:08.606 --> 00:02:10.186
we reduced our rate of heart disease.

00:02:10.566 --> 00:02:15.486
The effect size for that is
less than point one oh, okay?

00:02:15.766 --> 00:02:18.056
The effect size of the social
emotional learning programs

00:02:18.056 --> 00:02:20.176
on academic achievement
is point two eight.

00:02:20.176 --> 00:02:22.326
It's almost three times
that effect size.

00:02:23.676 --> 00:02:26.586
So we need to use language, I agree
with, language is very important,

00:02:26.676 --> 00:02:29.186
that we can get a sense of
the proportion of this effect.

00:02:29.186 --> 00:02:32.506
That's an effect that
literally can change the lives

00:02:32.506 --> 00:02:33.746
of millions of American children.

00:02:35.116 --> 00:02:37.716
&gt;&gt;Daniel: When you go to a school
and you say, "We've got this program.

00:02:38.406 --> 00:02:41.556
We want you to start doing it,"
and teachers are so hard pressed,

00:02:41.556 --> 00:02:42.756
don't you get a lot of pushback?

00:02:42.806 --> 00:02:43.906
"We don't have time for this."

00:02:43.906 --> 00:02:45.306
What's your response to that?

00:02:45.306 --> 00:02:47.936
&gt;&gt;Maurice: I frankly find that
this message was not something

00:02:47.936 --> 00:02:51.156
that people wanted to hear ten years
ago, but I think they're ready.

00:02:52.006 --> 00:02:55.316
I think they're ready, and
in New Jersey, of course,

00:02:55.316 --> 00:02:56.656
we have a way of making
sure they're ready.

00:02:57.346 --> 00:03:01.686
But in New Jersey,
the State Department

00:03:01.686 --> 00:03:05.546
of Education is actually funding an
effort that's now in its third year,

00:03:05.736 --> 00:03:09.666
developing safe and civil
schools, which has as its mission

00:03:10.036 --> 00:03:13.216
to bring social and emotional
and character development

00:03:13.336 --> 00:03:15.506
to all twenty-four
hundred New Jersey schools.

00:03:16.616 --> 00:03:20.456
So the aspiration is there, the
support is there, it's possible.

00:03:20.756 --> 00:03:23.666
&gt;&gt;Daniel: Let me ask you this, we've
been hearing that it's important

00:03:23.716 --> 00:03:25.396
to get to schools of education.

00:03:25.396 --> 00:03:29.266
At the same time, Roger's showing
that teachers can do this very well.

00:03:29.926 --> 00:03:33.436
Do you think that teachers need some
extra training before they become

00:03:33.436 --> 00:03:37.746
teachers, and how seamless is
it really, getting a teacher

00:03:37.746 --> 00:03:39.116
up to speed to teach SEL?

00:03:39.956 --> 00:03:42.946
&gt;&gt;Maurice: There's nothing
pedagogically challenging about most

00:03:42.946 --> 00:03:46.936
of what we ask teachers to do in
various SEL curricular programs,

00:03:46.936 --> 00:03:49.736
nothing beyond what they have to
do in most of their other pedagogy.

00:03:50.816 --> 00:03:53.476
Teachers are not used to
their language of emotions,

00:03:53.566 --> 00:03:55.616
and I think that's the
single biggest issues

00:03:55.966 --> 00:03:57.106
that we have to help them with.

00:03:57.896 --> 00:04:00.726
They don't know how to talk
to children about emotions

00:04:00.726 --> 00:04:02.816
and they're afraid how to respond

00:04:02.816 --> 00:04:05.496
when children mention
difficult emotions.

00:04:06.336 --> 00:04:09.086
And I think that's something that
should be part of teachers' training,

00:04:09.086 --> 00:04:13.656
because it's going to be what
they're faced with in the classroom.

00:04:13.656 --> 00:04:16.986
&gt;&gt;Daniel: Larry, you're really
an expert on education policy

00:04:17.146 --> 00:04:20.696
and it looks to me like
we've got a really good case

00:04:21.366 --> 00:04:24.116
from a scientific point of view
and a practice point of view,

00:04:24.656 --> 00:04:28.666
of bringing SEL into schools,
but it's not that easy, isn't it?

00:04:28.776 --> 00:04:32.596
There's a little thing called policy,
and what do you think it would take

00:04:32.806 --> 00:04:37.566
to convince key policy
decision makers to go for this?

00:04:38.276 --> 00:04:40.886
&gt;&gt;Larry: Well, the first thing I
wanna say is, I'm grateful for my--

00:04:41.356 --> 00:04:46.396
my brother from New
Jersey's comments,

00:04:46.746 --> 00:04:52.476
and I'd like to see the
whole family working.

00:04:52.716 --> 00:04:59.276
On a much more serious note,
policy is a gigantic task.

00:04:59.276 --> 00:05:03.116
I have the opportunity to talk about
policy in front of George Miller

00:05:03.116 --> 00:05:06.476
and Ed Ziegler and then
allude to one or two issues

00:05:06.476 --> 00:05:09.046
about communications
right before George Lucas,

00:05:09.046 --> 00:05:11.856
so take my comments in their context.

00:05:11.856 --> 00:05:17.236
One of the things that I think we've
heard already from the meeting today,

00:05:17.236 --> 00:05:20.986
and from Castle's work, is that
policy exists at multiple levels.

00:05:21.086 --> 00:05:25.986
It exists from the building level and
community level, through the district

00:05:25.986 --> 00:05:28.996
and municipality level, to the
state level, to the national level

00:05:28.996 --> 00:05:30.406
and indeed to the international
level.

00:05:30.806 --> 00:05:36.486
So I think explicit policy strategies
that recognize all of those levels,

00:05:36.486 --> 00:05:39.676
trying to create an echo
chamber, trying to create things

00:05:39.676 --> 00:05:42.066
that reinforce instead of
detract from each other

00:05:42.066 --> 00:05:44.046
at these multiple levels is one part.

00:05:44.446 --> 00:05:48.576
We need top down, bottom up
and middle out strategies.

00:05:49.056 --> 00:05:56.856
And policy equals politics, so Janice
Jackson said the big R word hasn't

00:05:57.006 --> 00:05:59.736
been described and used
much in this meeting.

00:06:00.206 --> 00:06:03.956
The other word is culture wars.

00:06:05.196 --> 00:06:08.896
We use the umbrella term,
social emotional learning.

00:06:09.176 --> 00:06:15.446
Red America uses the term social and
character development, and somehow,

00:06:15.886 --> 00:06:19.036
solving some of the political
issues related to, is this social

00:06:19.036 --> 00:06:23.616
and character development, and is it
religion and morals and values based,

00:06:23.616 --> 00:06:26.186
or is it social emotional learning,

00:06:26.266 --> 00:06:29.356
and is it science and
rationale based?

00:06:29.636 --> 00:06:31.966
That has to be solved.

00:06:31.966 --> 00:06:35.596
George Miller has scars all
over his body associated

00:06:35.596 --> 00:06:39.986
with the challenge of, do you do this
as evidence based or as values based?

00:06:40.126 --> 00:06:41.556
&gt;&gt;Daniel: What's your
answer, what's the most-- ?

00:06:41.556 --> 00:06:43.686
&gt;&gt;Larry: Yes, it has to be both.

00:06:43.686 --> 00:06:50.006
We have to align both, and we've
talked a lot about communications.

00:06:50.006 --> 00:06:52.316
We're going to talk about
communications more.

00:06:52.316 --> 00:06:54.226
Anybody in this room
who hasn't looked

00:06:54.706 --> 00:07:00.896
at the Frameworks Institute's
website, www.frameworksinstitute.org,

00:07:01.386 --> 00:07:04.726
it is about evidence based
communications strategies.

00:07:04.936 --> 00:07:10.596
The words we use, how they call
up, in Pedro Noguera's terms,

00:07:10.596 --> 00:07:13.256
our assumptions about what
the causes of the problem are,

00:07:13.776 --> 00:07:17.326
and how they dispose toward
preferred policy solutions.

00:07:17.326 --> 00:07:22.366
So we have to apply the same
rigor to policy development

00:07:23.036 --> 00:07:25.856
and to message development
associated with policies

00:07:25.856 --> 00:07:27.176
as we apply to our science.

00:07:27.846 --> 00:07:32.606
&gt;&gt;Daniel: You have gotten to
actually stake your ground

00:07:32.666 --> 00:07:38.616
in the education world as a
communicator, as finding the way

00:07:38.616 --> 00:07:44.266
to message the meat, so to speak, you
know, what works, what's promising,

00:07:44.416 --> 00:07:49.866
what's a beautiful vision, and
taking it to a public in a way

00:07:49.866 --> 00:07:51.126
that people resonate with.

00:07:52.016 --> 00:07:55.836
&gt;&gt;George: Our mission really is to
help facilitated high technology

00:07:55.836 --> 00:08:02.116
in the schools, and what that did
was take us to a place where, okay,

00:08:02.116 --> 00:08:03.396
you've got your computers
in your schools,

00:08:03.396 --> 00:08:04.256
now what do you do with them?

00:08:05.116 --> 00:08:08.956
But that took us into what we
call project based learning

00:08:09.446 --> 00:08:12.946
and collaborative learning,
which is basically what this is,

00:08:13.626 --> 00:08:17.036
and interdisciplinary
studies, and a lot of things

00:08:17.036 --> 00:08:18.296
that don't have anything
to do with technology,

00:08:18.566 --> 00:08:23.356
but the technology allows this to
happen, and they're all connected.

00:08:23.986 --> 00:08:25.966
So we sorta look at a bigger picture

00:08:25.966 --> 00:08:29.626
in which emotional
intelligence is one part of it.

00:08:29.626 --> 00:08:31.556
But when you start to
pull everything all apart,

00:08:31.766 --> 00:08:35.136
you realize that everything depends
on everything else in order to work.

00:08:35.906 --> 00:08:38.006
A computer allows you
to do a project.

00:08:38.186 --> 00:08:41.836
A project allows you to do it with
two or three people at a time.

00:08:41.946 --> 00:08:45.266
That basically demands
emotional intelligence.

00:08:45.316 --> 00:08:49.606
It's not just for the recess, you
know, where you learn who gets

00:08:49.606 --> 00:08:50.826
to go on the jungle gym first.

00:08:50.856 --> 00:08:54.466
It's actually, you know, and I
hear it from my own kids, you know,

00:08:54.466 --> 00:08:56.146
they say, "Well, I gotta do
this project with so and so.

00:08:56.146 --> 00:08:57.086
I hate him."

00:08:57.556 --> 00:08:59.236
And I say, "Well, you know,
that's the way the world is.

00:08:59.236 --> 00:09:01.046
You're gonna have to learn
to work with people you hate.

00:09:01.726 --> 00:09:04.466
That's just the way it works,
and it's not gonna go away

00:09:04.466 --> 00:09:06.706
and you're gonna have
to learn how to do it."

00:09:07.166 --> 00:09:10.526
And to have the teachers
as facilitators explain it

00:09:10.576 --> 00:09:13.106
to the students ahead of time,
"This is how you make this work,"

00:09:14.676 --> 00:09:17.996
then their projects not only become
the academic project, but it becomes

00:09:17.996 --> 00:09:20.736
and emotional challenge
of, "How do I work

00:09:20.736 --> 00:09:22.286
with somebody and make this happen?"

00:09:23.386 --> 00:09:27.526
I like to say, you know, unless
you're a college professor

00:09:27.526 --> 00:09:30.716
or a scientist, you're never
gonna get fired for being stupid.

00:09:31.606 --> 00:09:33.726
You're only gonna get fired for
not being able to work with people,

00:09:34.676 --> 00:09:36.286
and that's usually the way
it works in the real world.

00:09:36.956 --> 00:09:42.936
&gt;&gt;Daniel: Actually, I saw a study of
CEOs which showed that they got hired

00:09:43.026 --> 00:09:44.956
for their business expertise
and their intelligence,

00:09:44.986 --> 00:09:47.846
but they got fired for lapses in
social and emotional learning.

00:09:48.016 --> 00:09:48.406
&gt;&gt;George: Yeah.

00:09:48.406 --> 00:09:52.076
&gt;&gt;Daniel: Which brings up the
question of, if you were going to try

00:09:52.176 --> 00:09:55.416
to sell this, to get this
message to the business community,

00:09:55.876 --> 00:09:57.186
what would you emphasize?

00:09:58.866 --> 00:10:05.686
&gt;&gt;George: Well, again, it's the
ability to work with other people.

00:10:05.686 --> 00:10:07.376
Any business, they know this.

00:10:07.736 --> 00:10:09.056
All businesses know this.

00:10:09.306 --> 00:10:14.076
They all know that what they want
is people who are team builders,

00:10:14.076 --> 00:10:16.056
who are able to work
with other people,

00:10:16.056 --> 00:10:19.856
who are able to inspire other people,
who are able to, without conflict,

00:10:20.336 --> 00:10:21.726
get other people to do things

00:10:21.726 --> 00:10:23.416
or change their ways
or this sort of thing.

00:10:23.666 --> 00:10:26.456
And if you can say, "This is
going to make that happen"

00:10:26.906 --> 00:10:29.706
to the business community, I'm
sure they would embrace it,

00:10:29.706 --> 00:10:31.646
because that's their biggest problem.

00:10:31.886 --> 00:10:34.196
&gt;&gt;Daniel: But what would
your message to parents be?

00:10:34.196 --> 00:10:36.706
I mean, don't parents really
care if their children are happy

00:10:36.706 --> 00:10:37.766
and doing well in school?

00:10:37.796 --> 00:10:39.916
I mean, don't you need
to change language-- ?

00:10:39.966 --> 00:10:41.536
&gt;&gt;George: But that's where some
of these statistics, you know,

00:10:41.536 --> 00:10:43.016
the fact that they
do better on tests.

00:10:43.116 --> 00:10:46.136
I mean, to me, that's the biggest
sales point here, is to say,

00:10:46.956 --> 00:10:49.316
"They will do better
on their test scores

00:10:49.316 --> 00:10:51.426
if they understand
emotional intelligence."

00:10:51.666 --> 00:10:54.156
That would get a parent behind it.

00:10:54.546 --> 00:10:58.976
If we can bring down the incidence of
violence in our school by doing this,

00:10:59.746 --> 00:11:04.106
and we can save some money by having
less police officers on the campus,

00:11:04.716 --> 00:11:06.016
well, that's a good argument.

00:11:07.576 --> 00:11:09.546
