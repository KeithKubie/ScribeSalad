feedbacks know it's feedback so what

many people point to their head when

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:32.990
many people point to their head when
 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:34.780
many people point to their head when
they talk about their mind and they

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:34.790
they talk about their mind and they
 

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:37.870
they talk about their mind and they
place the mind inside the skull but even

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:37.880
place the mind inside the skull but even
 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:39.700

if you kept the mind only inside the

the word embodied and many people do

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:45.520
the word embodied and many people do
 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:48.670
the word embodied and many people do
however once you say it's both embodied

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:48.680
however once you say it's both embodied
 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:52.930

and relational you get into this really

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:52.940

interesting new way of thinking because

you say how could one thing mind be both

00:04:59.320 --> 00:04:59.330
you say how could one thing mind be both

within in between in two places well

here's a way to think about it our

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:03.820
here's a way to think about it our
 

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:06.690
here's a way to think about it our
fundamental element we're proposing is

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:06.700

energy and information flow now if you

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:10.040
energy and information flow now if you
 

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:13.750
energy and information flow now if you
think about that the skull nor the skin

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:13.760
think about that the skull nor the skin
 

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:18.040
think about that the skull nor the skin
are impermeable boundaries for energy

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:18.050
are impermeable boundaries for energy
 

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:20.560
are impermeable boundaries for energy
and information to flow so you may think

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:20.570
and information to flow so you may think
 

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:23.230
and information to flow so you may think
of them as two places but it's one

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:23.240
of them as two places but it's one
 

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:26.409

system energy and information flow and

00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:26.419
system energy and information flow and
 

00:05:26.419 --> 00:05:28.840
system energy and information flow and
it's happening in many different

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:28.850
it's happening in many different
 

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:31.140
