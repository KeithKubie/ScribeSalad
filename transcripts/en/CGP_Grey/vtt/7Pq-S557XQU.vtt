00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:08.990
Every human used to have to hunt or gather to survive. But humans are smart...ly lazy so

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:13.680
we made tools to make our work easier. From sticks, to plows, to tractors we’ve gone

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:18.140
from everyone needing to make food to, modern agriculture with almost no one needing to

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:20.360
make food — and yet, we still have abundance.

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.080
Of course, it’s not just farming, it’s
everything. We’ve spent the last several

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:29.580
thousand years building tools to reduce physical
labor of all kinds. These are mechanical muscles.

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.140
Stronger, more reliable, and more tireless
than human muscles ever could be.

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.660
And that's a good thing. Replacing human labor
with mechanical muscles frees people to specialize

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:44.370
and that leaves everyone better off - even those
still doing physical labor. This is how economies

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.610
grow and standards of living rise.

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:51.230
Some people have specialized to be programmers
and engineers whose job is to build mechanical

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:56.120
minds. Just as mechanical muscles made human
labor less in demand so are mechanical minds

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.100
making human brain labor less in demand.

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.809
This is an economic revolution. You may think
we've been here before, but we haven't.

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.499
This time is different.

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.130
## Physical Labor

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:11.619
When you think of automation, you probably
think of this: giant, custom-built, expensive,

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:16.450
efficient, but really dumb robots blind to
the world and their own work. They were a

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:20.450
scary kind of automation but they haven't
taken over the world because they're only

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:23.310
cost effective in narrow situations.

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.279
But they're the old kind of automation, this
is the new kind.

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:28.319
Meet Baxter.

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.200
Unlike these things which require skilled
operators and technicians and millions of dollars,

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:37.039
Baxter has vision and can learn what
you want him to do by watching you do it.

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:41.579
And he costs less than the average annual
salary of a human worker. Unlike his older

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:46.649
brothers he isn't pre-programmed for one specific
job, he can do whatever work is within the

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:51.399
reach of his arms. Baxter is what might be
thought of as a general purpose robot and

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:53.579
general purpose is a big deal.

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:58.849
Think computers, they too started out as highly
custom and highly expensive, but when cheap-ish

00:01:58.849 --> 00:02:02.749
general-purpose computers appeared they quickly
became vital to everything.

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:07.429
A general-purpose computer can just as easily
calculate change or assign seats on an airplane

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:13.180
or play a game or do anything just by swapping
its software. And this huge demand for computers

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:18.170
of all kinds is what makes them both more
powerful and cheaper every year.

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:23.320
Baxter today is the computer of the 1980s.
He’s not the apex but the beginning. Even

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:27.960
if Baxter is slow his hourly cost is pennies
worth of electricity while his meat-based

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:32.770
competition costs minimum wage. A tenth the
speed is still cost effective when it's a

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:36.610
hundredth the price. And while Baxter isn't
as smart as some of the other things we will

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:40.600
talk about, he's smart enough to take over
many low-skill jobs.

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:45.290
And we've already seen how dumber robots than
Baxter can replace jobs. In new supermarkets

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:50.540
what used to be 30 humans is now one human
overseeing 30 cashier robots.

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:54.820
Or take the hundreds of thousand baristas employed
world-wide? There’s a barista robot coming

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:59.960
for them. Sure maybe your guy makes the double-mocha-whatever
just perfect and you’d never trust anyone

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:05.260
else -- but millions of people don’t care
and just want a decent cup of coffee. Oh, and

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:09.300
by the way this robot is actually a giant
network of robots that remembers who you are

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:13.040
and how you like your coffee no matter where
you are. Pretty convenient.

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:17.650
We think of technological change as the fancy
new expensive stuff, but the real change comes

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:22.360
from last decade's stuff getting cheaper and
faster. That's what's happening to robots

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:27.230
now. And because their mechanical minds are
capable of decision making they are out-competing

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:31.730
humans for jobs in a way no pure mechanical
muscle ever could.

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:33.670
## Luddite Horses

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:38.180
Imagine a pair of horses in the early 1900s
talking about technology. One worries all

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:41.170
these new mechanical muscles will make horses
unnecessary.

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:45.420
The other reminds him that everything so far
has made their lives easier -- remember all

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:50.210
that farm work? Remember running from coast-to-coast
delivering mail? Remember riding into battle?

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:54.930
All terrible. These city jobs are pretty cushy, and with so many humans in the cities there

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:57.400
will be more jobs for horses than ever.

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:00.200
Even if this car thingy takes off - he might say - there will be

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:02.660
new jobs for horses we can't imagine.

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:08.240
But you, dear viewer, from beyond 2000 know
what happened -- there are still working horses,

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:13.650
but nothing like before. The horse population
peaked in 1915 -- from that point on it was

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:14.650
nothing but down.

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:18.900
There isn’t a rule of economics that says
better technology makes more better jobs

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:24.599
for horses. It sounds shockingly dumb to even
say that out loud, but swap horses for humans

00:04:24.599 --> 00:04:27.389
and suddenly people think it sounds about
right.

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:31.460
As mechanical muscles pushed horses out of
the economy, mechanical minds will do the

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:37.099
same to humans. Not immediately, not everywhere,
but in large enough numbers and soon enough

00:04:37.099 --> 00:04:42.099
that it's going to be a huge problem if we
are not prepared. And we are not prepared.

00:04:42.099 --> 00:04:46.099
You, like the second horse, may look at the
state of technology now and think it can’t

00:04:46.099 --> 00:04:50.310
possibly replace your job. But technology
gets better, cheaper, and faster at a rate

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:52.090
biology can’t match.

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:56.520
Just as the car was the beginning of the end
for the horse so now does the car show us

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:57.710
the shape of things to come.

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:01.999
## Automobiles

00:05:01.999 --> 00:05:05.999
Self-driving cars aren't the future: they're
here and they work. Self-driving cars have

00:05:05.999 --> 00:05:09.419
travelled hundreds of thousands of miles up
and down the California coast and through

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:12.199
cities -- all without human intervention.

00:05:12.199 --> 00:05:16.870
The question is not if they'll replaces cars,
but how quickly. They don’t need to be perfect,

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:22.580
they just need to be better than us. Humans
drivers, by the way, kill 40,000 people a

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:26.979
year with cars just in the United States.
Given that self-driving cars don’t blink,

00:05:26.979 --> 00:05:30.960
don’t text while driving, don’t get sleepy
or stupid, it's easy to see them being better

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:33.779
than humans because they already are.

00:05:33.779 --> 00:05:39.150
Now to describe self-driving cars as cars
at all is like calling the first cars mechanical

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:44.090
horses. Cars in all their forms are so much
more than horses that using the name limits

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:48.710
your thinking about what they can even do.
Lets call self-driving cars what they really

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:49.289
are:

00:05:49.289 --> 00:05:55.129
Autos: the solution to the transport-objects-from-point-A-to-point-B
problem. Traditional cars happen to be human

00:05:55.129 --> 00:05:59.669
sized to transport humans but tiny autos can
work in warehouses and gigantic autos can

00:05:59.669 --> 00:06:04.539
work in pit mines. Moving stuff around is
who knows how many jobs but the transportation

00:06:04.539 --> 00:06:09.319
industry in the United States employs about
three million people. Extrapolating world-wide

00:06:09.319 --> 00:06:13.469
that’s something like 70 million jobs at
a minimum.

00:06:13.469 --> 00:06:15.270
These jobs are over.

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:19.370
The usual argument is that unions will prevent
it. But history is filled with workers who

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:24.870
fought technology that would replace them
and the workers always lose. Economics always

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:30.389
wins and there are huge incentives across
wildly diverse industries to adopt autos.

00:06:30.389 --> 00:06:34.749
For many transportation companies, humans
are about a third their total costs. That's

00:06:34.749 --> 00:06:39.439
just the straight salary costs. Humans sleeping
in their long haul trucks costs time and money.

00:06:39.439 --> 00:06:44.069
Accidents cost money. Carelessness costs money.
If you think insurance companies will be against

00:06:44.069 --> 00:06:48.689
it, guess what? Their perfect driver is one
who pays their small premiums and never gets

00:06:48.689 --> 00:06:50.099
into an accident.

00:06:50.099 --> 00:06:54.110
The autos are coming and they're the first
place where most people will really see the

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:58.490
robots changing society. But there are many
other places in the economy where the same

00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:00.860
thing is happening, just less visibly.

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:03.780
So it goes with autos, so it goes for everything.

00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:06.400
## The Shape of Things to Come

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:10.740
It's easy to look at Autos and Baxters and
think: technology has always gotten rid of

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:15.400
low-skill jobs we don't want people doing
anyway. They'll get more skilled and do better

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:17.900
educated jobs -- like they've always done.

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:22.580
Even ignoring the problem of pushing a hundred-million
additional people through higher education,

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:27.009
white-collar work is no safe haven either.
If your job is sitting in front of a screen

00:07:27.009 --> 00:07:31.110
and typing and clicking -- like maybe you're
supposed to be doing right now -- the bots

00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:32.539
are coming for you too, buddy.

00:07:32.539 --> 00:07:37.599
Software bots are both intangible and way
faster and cheaper than physical robots. Given

00:07:37.599 --> 00:07:41.960
that white collar workers are, from a company's
perspective, both more expensive and more

00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:46.129
numerous -- the incentive to automate their
work is greater than low skilled work.

00:07:46.129 --> 00:07:51.009
And that's just what automation engineers
are for. These are skilled programmers whose

00:07:51.009 --> 00:07:54.759
entire job is to replace your job with a software
bot.

00:07:54.759 --> 00:07:58.939
You may think even the world's smartest automation
engineer could never make a bot to do your

00:07:58.939 --> 00:08:03.669
job -- and you may be right -- but the cutting
edge of programming isn't super-smart programmers

00:08:03.669 --> 00:08:08.589
writing bots, it's super-smart programmers
writing bots that teach themselves how to

00:08:08.589 --> 00:08:11.749
do things the programmer could never teach
them to do.

00:08:11.749 --> 00:08:15.529
How that works is well beyond the scope of
this video, but the bottom line is there are

00:08:15.529 --> 00:08:20.249
limited ways to show a bot a bunch of stuff
to do, show the bot a bunch of correctly done

00:08:20.249 --> 00:08:23.969
stuff, and it can figure out how to do the
job to be done.

00:08:23.969 --> 00:08:28.099
Even with just a goal and no knowledge of how
to do it the bots can still learn. Take the

00:08:28.099 --> 00:08:33.680
stock market which, in many ways, is no longer
a human endeavor. It's mostly bots that taught

00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:38.160
themselves to trade stocks, trading stocks
with other bots that taught themselves.

00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:42.039
As a result, the floor of the New York Stock
exchange isn't filled with traders doing their

00:08:42.039 --> 00:08:44.780
day jobs anymore, it's largely a TV set.

00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:48.970
So bots have learned the market and bots have
learned to write. If you've picked up a newspaper

00:08:48.970 --> 00:08:53.240
lately you've probably already read a story
written by a bot. There are companies that

00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:57.940
teach bots to write anything: sports
stories, TPS reports, even say, those quarterly

00:08:57.940 --> 00:08:59.730
reports that you write at work.

00:08:59.730 --> 00:09:03.680
Paper work, decision making, writing -- a
lot of human work falls into that category

00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:09.510
and the demand for human metal labor is these
areas is on the way down. But surely the professions

00:09:09.510 --> 00:09:11.930
are safe from bots? Yes?

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.240
## Professional Bots

00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:19.880
When you think 'lawyer' it's easy to think
of trials. But the bulk of lawyering is actually

00:09:19.890 --> 00:09:24.380
drafting legal documents, predicting the likely
outcome and impact of lawsuits, and something

00:09:24.380 --> 00:09:28.730
called 'discovery' which is where boxes of
paperwork gets dumped on the lawyers and they

00:09:28.730 --> 00:09:32.610
need to find the pattern or the one out-of-place
transaction among it all.

00:09:32.610 --> 00:09:38.700
This can be bot work. Discovery, in particular,
is already not a human job in many law firms.

00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:42.420
Not because there isn't paperwork to go through,
there's more of it than ever, but because

00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:46.720
clever research bots shift through millions
of emails and memos and accounts in hours

00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:51.750
not weeks -- crushing human researchers in
terms of not just cost and time but, most

00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:56.810
importantly, accuracy. Bots don't get sleepy
reading through a million emails.

00:09:56.810 --> 00:10:01.340
But that's the simple stuff: IBM has a bot
named Watson: you may have seen him on TV

00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:05.590
destroy humans at Jeopardy — but that was
just a fun side project for him.

00:10:05.590 --> 00:10:09.810
Watson's day-job is to be the best doctor
in the world: to understand what people say

00:10:09.810 --> 00:10:14.250
in their own words and give back accurate
diagnoses. And he's already doing that at

00:10:14.250 --> 00:10:17.710
Slone-Kettering, giving guidance on lung cancer
treatments.

00:10:17.710 --> 00:10:21.700
Just as Auto don’t need to be perfect -- they
just need to make fewer mistakes than humans --

00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:23.930
the same goes for doctor bots.

00:10:23.930 --> 00:10:28.100
Human doctors are by no means perfect -- the
frequency and severity of misdiagnoses are

00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:33.240
terrifying -- and human doctors are severely
limited in dealing with a human's complicated

00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:37.940
medical history. Understanding every drug
and every drug's interaction with every other

00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:40.940
drug is beyond the scope of human knowability.

00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:45.450
Especially when there are research robots
whose whole job it is to test thousands of new

00:10:45.450 --> 00:10:47.030
drugs at a time.

00:10:47.030 --> 00:10:51.200
And human doctors can only improve through their
own experiences. Doctor bots can learn from

00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:54.930
the experiences of every doctor bot. Can read
the latest in medical research and keep track

00:10:54.930 --> 00:10:59.190
of everything that happens to all their patients
world-wide and make correlations that would

00:10:59.190 --> 00:11:01.760
be impossible to find otherwise.

00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:06.350
Not all doctors will go away, but when the doctor
bots are comparable to humans and they're

00:11:06.350 --> 00:11:10.850
only as far away as your phone -- the need
for general doctors will be less.

00:11:10.850 --> 00:11:15.350
So professionals, white-collar workers and
low-skill workers all have things to worry about

00:11:15.350 --> 00:11:21.260
from automation. But perhaps you are unfazed because
you're a special creative snowflake. Well

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:23.400
guess what? You're not that special.

00:11:23.620 --> 00:11:26.720
## Creative Bots

00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:32.680
Creativity may feel like magic, but it isn't.
The brain is a complicated machine -- perhaps

00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:36.920
the most complicated machine in the whole
universe -- but that hasn't stopped us from

00:11:36.930 --> 00:11:38.220
trying to simulate it.

00:11:38.220 --> 00:11:42.050
There is this notion that just as mechanical
muscles allowed us to move into thinking jobs

00:11:42.050 --> 00:11:45.510
that mechanical minds will allow us  to
move into creative work.

00:11:45.510 --> 00:11:50.450
But even if we assume  the human mind is magically creative -- it's
not, but just for the sake of argument --

00:11:50.450 --> 00:11:55.940
artistic creativity isn't what the majority of jobs
depend on. The number of writers and poets

00:11:55.940 --> 00:12:00.630
and directors and actors and artists who actually
make a living doing their work is a tiny,

00:12:00.630 --> 00:12:04.540
tiny portion of the labor force. And given
that these are professions dependent

00:12:04.550 --> 00:12:08.610
on popularity they'll always be a very small
portion of the population.

00:12:08.610 --> 00:12:12.800
There can't be such a thing as a poem and painting
based economy.

00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:17.270
Oh, by the way, this music in the background
that you're listening to? It was written by a bot.

00:12:17.270 --> 00:12:21.790
Her name is Emily Howell and she can
write an infinite amount of new music all day for free.

00:12:21.790 --> 00:12:25.050
And people can't tell the difference between her and human composers

00:12:25.050 --> 00:12:27.000
when put to a blind test.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:31.080
Talking about artificial creativity gets weird
fast -- what does that even mean?

00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:33.800
But it's nonetheless a developing field.

00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:37.390
People used to think that playing chess was
a uniquely creative human skill that machines

00:12:37.390 --> 00:12:43.070
could never do right up until they beat the
best of us. And so it will go for all human talents.

00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:46.120
## Conclusion

00:12:47.220 --> 00:12:51.220
Right: this may have been a lot to take
in, and you might want to reject it -- it's

00:12:51.220 --> 00:12:55.610
easy to be cynical of the endless and idiotic
predictions of futures that never are. So

00:12:55.610 --> 00:13:00.190
that's why it's important to emphasize again that
this stuff isn't science fiction. The robots

00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:05.530
are here right now. There is a terrifying
amount of working automation in labs and warehouses

00:13:05.530 --> 00:13:07.470
around the world.

00:13:07.470 --> 00:13:12.950
We have been through economic revolutions
before, but the robot revolution is different.

00:13:12.950 --> 00:13:17.990
Horses aren't unemployed now because they
got lazy as a species, they’re unemployable.

00:13:17.990 --> 00:13:21.440
There's little work a horse can do that do
to pay for its housing and hay.

00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:26.620
And many bright, perfectly capable humans
will find themselves the new horse: unemployable

00:13:26.620 --> 00:13:28.220
through no fault of their own.

00:13:28.220 --> 00:13:33.010
But if you still think new jobs will save
us: here is one final point to consider. The

00:13:33.010 --> 00:13:38.620
US census in 1776 tracked only a few kinds
of jobs. Now there are hundreds of kinds of

00:13:38.620 --> 00:13:42.870
jobs, but the new ones are not a significant
part of the labor force.

00:13:42.870 --> 00:13:46.880
Here's the list of jobs ranked by the number
of people who perform them - it's a sobering

00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:52.370
list with the transportation industry at the
top. Continuing downward, all of this work existed

00:13:52.370 --> 00:13:58.450
in some form a hundred years ago and almost
all of them are targets for automation. Only

00:13:58.450 --> 00:14:02.660
when we get to number 33 on the list is there
finally something new.

00:14:02.660 --> 00:14:07.340
Don't that every barista or white collar worker need lose their job before things are a problem.

00:14:07.340 --> 00:14:10.010
The unemployment rate during the great depression
was 25%.

00:14:10.010 --> 00:14:17.360
This list above is 45% of the workforce. Just
what we've talked about today, the stuff that

00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:22.520
already works, can push us over that number
pretty soon. And given that even in our modern

00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:28.210
technological wonderland new kinds of work
aren't a significant portion of the economy,

00:14:28.210 --> 00:14:29.990
this is a big problem.

00:14:29.990 --> 00:14:34.870
This video isn't about how automation is bad
-- rather that automation is inevitable. It's

00:14:34.870 --> 00:14:39.960
a tool to produce abundance for little effort.
We need to start thinking now about what to

00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:44.520
do when large sections of the population are
unemployable -- through no fault of their own.

00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:49.220
What to do in a future where, for most
jobs, humans need not apply.
