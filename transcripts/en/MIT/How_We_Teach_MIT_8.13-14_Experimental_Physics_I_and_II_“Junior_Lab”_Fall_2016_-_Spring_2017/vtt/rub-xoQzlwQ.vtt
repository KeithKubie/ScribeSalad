GUNTHER ROLAND: So
I'm Gunther Roland.

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:08.735
I'm a professor in the
physics department.

00:00:08.735 --> 00:00:12.260
I have been at MIT
for about 17 years,

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:15.530
have taught Junior Lab
for close to 20 semesters,

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:17.780
and for the last few
years have served

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:19.940
as director of Junior Lab.

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:22.520
So in that role, we've
tried to incorporate

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:27.050
a number of new elements in
the lab, both in 8.13 and 8.14.

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:31.670
And the other role I have is
to coordinate various sections

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:34.000
of the lab a little bit.
