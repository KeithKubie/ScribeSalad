00:00:06.448 --> 00:00:08.432
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:09.424 --> 00:00:10.786
OBI FELTEN: Right.

00:00:10.786 --> 00:00:12.090
Well, hello everyone.

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.520
It's a real honor to be here.

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:17.880
I'm following Maryann Bruce,
which is pretty tough,

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.560
and I'm standing between you and
drinks, which is pretty tough,

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:21.060
too.

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.080
But I'll try and make the next
20 minutes interesting, OK?

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:32.310
So I work at X. We're the
team behind self-driving cars,

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:39.330
self-flying delivery vehicles,
smartglasses, smart contact

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:46.300
lenses, energy kites, and
internet from balloons.

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:50.020
We work on solving large
problems with technology.

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:54.130
But this talk isn't
about X. This talk

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:57.930
is about how to kill good
things-- a good idea,

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.110
a project, your company, or
your current job-- to make

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:05.440
room for truly great ones.

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:09.330
We don't like killing our own
projects, because it's hard.

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:14.220
And it's hard for two
reasons-- fear and inertia.

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.187
And to overcome these two
things that stand in your way,

00:01:17.187 --> 00:01:18.520
you have to tackle them head-on.

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:22.340
And that's what my talk
is going to be about.

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.520
So let's start with inertia.

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.800
This is Newton's
first law of motion.

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:31.120
And as you know, as
a good physicist,

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:34.590
the bigger the mass and the
faster the object is moving,

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.060
the more force you have to apply
to stop it or divert its path.

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.690
Well, the rest of
life is just the same.

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:44.490
It's often much easier
for us to just keep going.

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:49.290
But the longer we keep
going with a project,

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.240
the higher is the
opportunity cost

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.698
if we eventually do kill it.

00:01:54.698 --> 00:01:57.910
At X, we therefore try
to kill as many things as

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:01.480
possible as early as possible.

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:05.196
Our process starts with a
small team called Rapid Eval.

00:02:05.196 --> 00:02:08.610
They are a team of polymath
scientists and prototypers,

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.030
and their job is
to create new ideas

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:13.560
and prototype them as
quickly as possible,

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.530
and figure out whether
they work or not.

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.090
And if they don't
work, they kill them.

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:21.300
I asked Rich, the guy who
runs our team, how many

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:24.630
of their ideas make it through.

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:27.380
And he said, oh, about 3%.

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:30.080
So about 3% of Rapid
Eval ideas make it

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.290
into the next stage,
which is Foundry.

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.420
And that's my team.

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:37.310
So we're a group of product
managers, of engineers,

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:41.490
of strategists, and we continue
to de-risk the technology,

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:44.360
but we also try and
find product market fit.

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:47.030
And we build business plans.

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:49.120
And we try and do
that within a year,

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.070
just like a startup would do.

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:56.270
And the goal of that year is
to either de-risk the project

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:58.274
to a point where we're
comfortable growing it,

00:02:58.274 --> 00:03:00.440
and therefore graduate it
to become an independent X

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:03.694
project, or we kill it.

00:03:03.694 --> 00:03:05.360
Now, you'll notice
on this chart that we

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.760
don't hire a manager
for the project

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:09.530
until it graduates from Foundry.

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:11.010
And that's deliberate.

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:14.790
Because often, the lead
is the last person who

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:18.240
wants to kill their project.

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:20.500
The chart also illustrates
the opportunity

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.740
cost-- the professional
opportunity cost to X--

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:27.880
that the longer we wait to
close a project down that no

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:32.480
longer makes sense, the bigger
the waste of our resources.

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:34.740
But also, think about the
personal opportunity cost

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:37.190
to the people on that team.

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:38.940
When you wake up in
the morning, are you

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:41.000
excited about going into work?

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.800
Or do you think, I'd rather
be spending time with my kids,

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:46.280
or sailing a boat
across the Pacific?

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:50.730
When that balance tips, it's
time to beat the inertia

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:51.340
and move on.

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:56.860
Now let's talk about fear.

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:59.710
Killing our own
project is scary.

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:03.170
We're afraid of losing
the respect of our peers.

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:06.790
We're afraid of losing that
promotion or of our job.

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:08.710
Or we're simply
afraid of the unknown,

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:12.340
of what's going to happen next.

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:16.649
I had a really big crash early
on in my career which redefined

00:04:16.649 --> 00:04:19.959
my relationship with that fear.

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:22.500
In the late 1990s,
those internet

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:24.440
heydays that Ruth
was talking about,

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:28.910
I was working for a high-flying
management consulting firm.

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:31.230
And I did a lot of
internet case studies,

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:33.000
like for an insurance company.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.100
Should we sell insurance online?

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:36.230
We said yes, they should.

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:41.120
So in 1999, when
all of my friends

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:45.280
went to business school, I
went to a startup instead.

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:46.840
It was called eToys.

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:50.810
As you might guess,
we sold toys online.

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:52.950
I was one of the
first product managers

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:54.620
that they hired in the UK.

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:56.480
So I worked on the UK website.

00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:00.610
And then I was the first person
to start eToys in Germany.

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:02.490
So I helped to set
up the company.

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:03.610
I hired the people.

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:06.530
I worked on the website.

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:10.870
In the summer of 2000, our
board back in California

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:13.300
pulled the plug on
our launch a week

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:17.170
before the toys were
coming into the warehouse.

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:19.950
EToys was losing too
much money, too fast,

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:21.795
and expanding to Germany
was not a priority.

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:27.990
So I had to fire all those
people I'd just hired

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:30.530
and had sold on
the internet dream.

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:33.380
I had to fire people
who came to join us

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:36.500
after 20 years of
successful careers in retail

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:38.480
with good pension schemes.

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:41.890
That was really,
really horrible.

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:44.210
And it didn't save eToys.

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:48.220
We went bust just
six months later.

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:51.150
In the European team, we
saw the writing on the wall,

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:57.120
and we let everyone go one
week before Christmas, 2000.

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:01.890
That was horrible, too, firing
people a week before Christmas.

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:04.790
But everyone got paid, and
we closed the company down

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:07.220
in an organized fashion.

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:10.500
In the US, eToys kept going
until the creditors showed up

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:14.600
in the office and
impounded the furniture.

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:17.390
So what I learned
from that is no matter

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:20.730
how bad things get,
even at the worst time,

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:22.490
when you have to close
down your company

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:24.700
and you have to
fire your friends,

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:27.640
it's better to face those facts
earlier, rather than later.

00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:34.130
I'm still friends with many
people that were at eToys.

00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:37.180
In fact, I saw one of
them just this week.

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:41.020
She now runs a
charity about a cause

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:42.890
that she's really
passionate about.

00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:47.692
Many of them have gone on to
do bigger and better things.

00:06:47.692 --> 00:06:49.650
So having this experience
so early in my career

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:51.150
made me fearless.

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:53.090
Actually, that's not true.

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:54.830
I'm scared all the time.

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:56.930
I was scared just now,
when I stepped out

00:06:56.930 --> 00:06:57.961
in front of all of you.

00:06:57.961 --> 00:07:00.210
That's why I have my phone,
so I have my notes in case

00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:03.530
I forget what I want to say.

00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:07.020
But I've trained myself to
be brave in the face of fear.

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:09.330
And in fact, that's the
definition of bravery.

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:14.960
Bravery is about taking
action in spite of your fears.

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:18.130
When you decide to kill a
project or your company,

00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:21.580
that takes, perhaps,
the most bravery.

00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:23.890
But we don't have the
opportunity every day.

00:07:23.890 --> 00:07:27.380
So how can we train
ourselves to be brave?

00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:29.590
Well, it turns out there
are many opportunities

00:07:29.590 --> 00:07:33.040
to practice bravery in
our work and in our lives.

00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:38.410
So here's my list of
five opportunities

00:07:38.410 --> 00:07:41.560
to practice bravery.

00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:43.250
Number one.

00:07:43.250 --> 00:07:43.910
Jump in.

00:07:43.910 --> 00:07:46.680
Try something new.

00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:50.100
Even if you have no idea whether
you're going to be good at it.

00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:52.950
You all remember the first
day in your first job, right?

00:07:52.950 --> 00:07:56.120
When you walked in and you
had no clue what was going on?

00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:57.300
I started in consulting.

00:07:57.300 --> 00:08:02.470
I don't know what Excel was
until some kind soul showed me.

00:08:02.470 --> 00:08:04.600
I did such a jump into
the unknown again,

00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:08.180
almost four years ago,
when I came here to X.

00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:13.054
I left behind a great role as
director of consumer marketing

00:08:13.054 --> 00:08:15.400
in EMEA, in Europe.

00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:18.650
I left behind a team I loved,
where I knew everybody.

00:08:18.650 --> 00:08:22.230
I left behind a credible
career in marketing.

00:08:22.230 --> 00:08:24.970
Even though I've always thought
of myself as a product manager,

00:08:24.970 --> 00:08:26.770
I found myself to
be the number 4

00:08:26.770 --> 00:08:33.360
on the UK list of top marketers,
just after the CMO of Unilever.

00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:37.360
I also left behind the UK, which
had been my home for 20 years,

00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:40.870
and uprooted my family
to move to California.

00:08:40.870 --> 00:08:43.630
I was excited to
begin a new challenge,

00:08:43.630 --> 00:08:45.140
but I was also
really scared to walk

00:08:45.140 --> 00:08:49.560
into a team at X that was made
up of scientists and engineers

00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:51.490
only.

00:08:51.490 --> 00:08:56.160
Neither they nor I knew
what I would be doing,

00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:59.030
or whether I would
add any value.

00:08:59.030 --> 00:09:00.810
So how did I get over that fear?

00:09:00.810 --> 00:09:03.950
Well, I gave myself
a safety net.

00:09:03.950 --> 00:09:06.990
I agreed with my new
boss at X, Astro,

00:09:06.990 --> 00:09:11.670
that I would come for
six months to try it out.

00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:15.370
And I agreed with my old boss
back in Europe, [INAUDIBLE],

00:09:15.370 --> 00:09:17.712
to treat it like
a maternity leave.

00:09:17.712 --> 00:09:20.170
I would be gone for six months,
and then I would come back,

00:09:20.170 --> 00:09:23.710
just like after having a baby.

00:09:23.710 --> 00:09:25.690
After three months, I
called her and I said,

00:09:25.690 --> 00:09:26.810
I'm not coming back.

00:09:26.810 --> 00:09:28.890
And she said, you know,
I kind of suspected

00:09:28.890 --> 00:09:31.220
that was going to happen.

00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:32.760
But I truly didn't know.

00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:34.392
And that's why I
built the safety net.

00:09:37.930 --> 00:09:38.990
Number two.

00:09:38.990 --> 00:09:42.850
Ask stupid questions and
question assumptions.

00:09:42.850 --> 00:09:46.190
I attribute some of my
success in leading teams

00:09:46.190 --> 00:09:49.550
to my willingness to always
ask stupid questions.

00:09:49.550 --> 00:09:51.840
My team knows this.

00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:55.460
In my job, I have to learn
about a new area all the time.

00:09:55.460 --> 00:09:57.150
I'm always the person
in the room who

00:09:57.150 --> 00:09:59.820
knows the least about an area.

00:09:59.820 --> 00:10:01.990
So I ask a lot of questions.

00:10:01.990 --> 00:10:04.590
And often I find that there are
other people in the room who

00:10:04.590 --> 00:10:06.440
also didn't know
how that worked,

00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:10.240
or what the stupid
acronym stood for.

00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:12.970
And I found that the experts,
especially the engineers,

00:10:12.970 --> 00:10:16.256
are incredibly patient and
love to explain things to you.

00:10:16.256 --> 00:10:17.030
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:17.030 --> 00:10:20.510
You just have to ask them.

00:10:20.510 --> 00:10:23.010
Although I'm not
an engineer myself,

00:10:23.010 --> 00:10:25.140
I lead engineering teams.

00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:27.900
At first, this was
incredibly intimidating.

00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:33.460
How can I be their lead if
I can't be their tech lead?

00:10:33.460 --> 00:10:35.750
It turns out that
it's very valuable

00:10:35.750 --> 00:10:38.920
to check the assumptions that
have been made by everyone.

00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:41.910
Because widely held assumptions
often mask decisions

00:10:41.910 --> 00:10:43.860
that haven't actually been made.

00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:45.870
And what you'll find out,
if you question them,

00:10:45.870 --> 00:10:50.070
is that everyone holds
slightly different assumptions.

00:10:50.070 --> 00:10:52.100
Other times, my questions
point to an area

00:10:52.100 --> 00:10:54.860
that nobody has thought
about yet at all.

00:10:54.860 --> 00:10:57.170
So it turns out that
stupid questions can often

00:10:57.170 --> 00:10:59.433
be hard questions,
or helpful questions.

00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:04.160
Number three.

00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:06.015
Share your work
before it's done.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.790
So Google always had this
"launch early and iterate"

00:11:12.790 --> 00:11:14.970
principle.

00:11:14.970 --> 00:11:17.110
Gmail was famously
in beta for-- I

00:11:17.110 --> 00:11:19.970
think it was about five years.

00:11:19.970 --> 00:11:22.290
When Chrome first
launched, many websites

00:11:22.290 --> 00:11:24.090
didn't even render
in it properly,

00:11:24.090 --> 00:11:25.290
especially banking ones.

00:11:28.180 --> 00:11:31.610
At X, we work on hardware, which
takes a long time to get out,

00:11:31.610 --> 00:11:34.030
much longer than hardware.

00:11:34.030 --> 00:11:36.790
So what we do is we
take our prototypes out

00:11:36.790 --> 00:11:38.890
to get them in contact
with the real world

00:11:38.890 --> 00:11:42.360
long before they're ready,
long before they're anywhere

00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:46.490
near a finished product
in the conventional sense.

00:11:46.490 --> 00:11:48.280
Our self-driving
car prototypes have

00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:53.230
driven hundreds of millions
of miles on real roads,

00:11:53.230 --> 00:11:55.770
testing our hardware
and our software.

00:11:55.770 --> 00:11:58.830
And with Google Glass, we ran
perhaps the biggest experiment

00:11:58.830 --> 00:12:00.290
of all.

00:12:00.290 --> 00:12:02.860
In the Explorer
program we asked people

00:12:02.860 --> 00:12:06.280
to test not just the device,
the hardware and the software,

00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:08.830
but also to give us feedback
on the use cases, what

00:12:08.830 --> 00:12:10.780
it might be useful for.

00:12:10.780 --> 00:12:14.400
So from surgeons to chefs,
to parents, to oil engineers,

00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:16.890
to fashion models,
people tried it out,

00:12:16.890 --> 00:12:19.589
and they gave us feedback--
lots of bad feedback,

00:12:19.589 --> 00:12:20.380
some good feedback.

00:12:23.180 --> 00:12:25.990
And we learned so much.

00:12:25.990 --> 00:12:27.600
The feedback was invaluable.

00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:30.450
And in the end, it
led the Glass team

00:12:30.450 --> 00:12:34.160
to pivot away from a consumer
product to a device that's

00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:37.440
aimed more at the
business market.

00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:40.010
Now, it's always better
to get that feedback

00:12:40.010 --> 00:12:41.930
earlier rather than later.

00:12:41.930 --> 00:12:43.600
And this doesn't just
apply to products.

00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:44.820
It applies to anything.

00:12:44.820 --> 00:12:47.800
It could be a half-baked idea
that you share with your team.

00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:49.410
It could be some
paper wireframes

00:12:49.410 --> 00:12:51.760
that you show to your
friends and family.

00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:53.310
What matters is
that you don't keep

00:12:53.310 --> 00:12:55.950
polishing it and
polishing it until you

00:12:55.950 --> 00:12:57.930
feel comfortable sharing it.

00:12:57.930 --> 00:12:59.570
You have to still
feel uncomfortable.

00:12:59.570 --> 00:13:02.030
Because I guarantee you, if
you wait until it's polished

00:13:02.030 --> 00:13:03.902
and you feel comfortable,
it's too late.

00:13:06.990 --> 00:13:08.410
Number four.

00:13:08.410 --> 00:13:11.260
Stand up for your opinion.

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:13.040
It can be especially
scary if you're

00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:15.870
the only person in the room
who has a different view

00:13:15.870 --> 00:13:18.360
from everyone else.

00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:21.560
Our first use case for
Wing, our Drone project,

00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:23.680
was to deliver
defibrillators to people

00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:26.650
who just had a heart attack.

00:13:26.650 --> 00:13:29.360
Every minute counts
after a heart attack.

00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:31.760
So the idea was that
we would get you

00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:33.840
the defibrillator faster
than the ambulance can

00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:37.220
get there, and thus save lives.

00:13:37.220 --> 00:13:40.910
This assumption turned
out to be wrong.

00:13:40.910 --> 00:13:44.000
Matt, one of the researchers
in our User Experience team,

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.230
put dummies in the lab, and
he got innocent bystanders,

00:13:47.230 --> 00:13:48.850
and he gave him
the defibrillator.

00:13:48.850 --> 00:13:51.630
And he said, this person's
just had a heart attack.

00:13:51.630 --> 00:13:53.370
Save their life.

00:13:53.370 --> 00:13:56.730
And he timed how long it
took them to figure out

00:13:56.730 --> 00:13:58.550
how to use the defibrillator.

00:13:58.550 --> 00:14:00.950
It turns out--
quite a long time.

00:14:00.950 --> 00:14:03.080
In fact, about the
same time that it

00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:06.680
takes, on average, for
the ambulance to arrive.

00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:10.480
And if you do it wrong,
it doesn't work at all.

00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:13.910
The trouble was, the team was
in love with this use case.

00:14:13.910 --> 00:14:15.980
They loved the idea
of saving lives

00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:18.440
by delivering defibrillators.

00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:21.740
Some of them had joined
the project because of it.

00:14:21.740 --> 00:14:24.590
So Matt had to show the
data and its conclusions

00:14:24.590 --> 00:14:27.290
again and again.

00:14:27.290 --> 00:14:32.170
In the end, he got help from
Laura, one of my team members,

00:14:32.170 --> 00:14:35.675
and they finally convinced the
team to let go of this idea.

00:14:35.675 --> 00:14:37.800
So we still think that
delivering stuff with flying

00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:38.870
things is a good idea.

00:14:38.870 --> 00:14:40.619
But we won't be
delivering defibrillators.

00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:48.090
So this brings me back to
killing your own project.

00:14:48.090 --> 00:14:52.090
I already mentioned that 97%
of Rapid Eval investigations

00:14:52.090 --> 00:14:54.370
get killed.

00:14:54.370 --> 00:14:59.690
Earlier this month, we closed
down a project in Foundry

00:14:59.690 --> 00:15:02.650
after the team came to
us with the conclusion

00:15:02.650 --> 00:15:05.470
that it no longer made
sense to pursue it.

00:15:05.470 --> 00:15:07.410
They wrote a really
detailed post-mortem

00:15:07.410 --> 00:15:09.650
where they explained why.

00:15:09.650 --> 00:15:11.800
They stood up at the
all-hands this week at X

00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:15.090
and they explained it to
everyone for half an hour.

00:15:15.090 --> 00:15:17.690
And later this year, we hope
to publish their findings

00:15:17.690 --> 00:15:20.080
in a peer-reviewed journal.

00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:23.630
The important part is this--
I didn't kill that project.

00:15:23.630 --> 00:15:26.290
And Rich, who runs Rapid Eval
doesn't kill the Rapid Eval

00:15:26.290 --> 00:15:27.180
investigations.

00:15:27.180 --> 00:15:29.590
It's always the team.

00:15:29.590 --> 00:15:32.110
Because Xers are encouraged
to kill the ideas

00:15:32.110 --> 00:15:34.520
and to kill their projects
as soon as it makes

00:15:34.520 --> 00:15:37.710
sense to do so-- and
they're rewarded for it.

00:15:37.710 --> 00:15:39.510
In Rapid Eval,
they get a sticker

00:15:39.510 --> 00:15:41.810
of a crumpled piece of
paper, and they put it

00:15:41.810 --> 00:15:44.870
on their laptops as
a badge of honor.

00:15:44.870 --> 00:15:48.060
People get applause
from their peers.

00:15:48.060 --> 00:15:49.510
They get a spot bonus.

00:15:49.510 --> 00:15:54.280
I gave my team that closed down
their own project a spot bonus.

00:15:54.280 --> 00:15:59.180
They get promoted because
of it, not despite it.

00:15:59.180 --> 00:16:01.420
And they get exciting
new jobs, because as soon

00:16:01.420 --> 00:16:03.860
as the project closes
down, every other project

00:16:03.860 --> 00:16:06.260
tries to recruit them.

00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:08.340
So in other words,
we remove the fear

00:16:08.340 --> 00:16:13.230
and we make it safe for people
to kill their own project.

00:16:13.230 --> 00:16:15.850
Now let's talk about the
elephant in the room.

00:16:15.850 --> 00:16:18.890
Some of you might be thinking,
OK, that's really nice.

00:16:18.890 --> 00:16:22.550
You work at X. Um, but
my organization's nothing

00:16:22.550 --> 00:16:24.600
like this.

00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:26.520
So for those of you who
are running companies

00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:29.000
and for those of you who are
running teams in the room,

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:30.530
please, this is your job.

00:16:30.530 --> 00:16:31.140
Right?

00:16:31.140 --> 00:16:35.010
You have to remove the fear
and remove the inertia.

00:16:35.010 --> 00:16:38.620
So please go back and
do that next week.

00:16:38.620 --> 00:16:41.060
If you work in a team
where the culture is not

00:16:41.060 --> 00:16:44.420
supportive of this kind of
behavior, you have two options.

00:16:44.420 --> 00:16:49.330
You can change the culture
from within, or you move on.

00:16:49.330 --> 00:16:54.740
In between eToys
and Google, I worked

00:16:54.740 --> 00:16:58.480
in brick-and-mortar
retailers for five years,

00:16:58.480 --> 00:16:59.690
for a very simple reason.

00:16:59.690 --> 00:17:03.600
When eToys went bust in 2001,
how many ecommerce start-ups

00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:05.130
do you think got funded?

00:17:05.130 --> 00:17:05.740
Not many.

00:17:08.790 --> 00:17:11.150
But in retail, I often
felt like an alien that

00:17:11.150 --> 00:17:12.500
had landed in another planet.

00:17:15.010 --> 00:17:17.240
And in my last job,
just before Google,

00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:19.410
the culture in my ecommerce
team was very different

00:17:19.410 --> 00:17:21.849
from the rest of the company.

00:17:21.849 --> 00:17:23.750
And the physical
manifestation of this

00:17:23.750 --> 00:17:27.560
was the fact that we had painted
our walls pink and turquoise

00:17:27.560 --> 00:17:31.780
in a fun team event, because
the office was really drab.

00:17:31.780 --> 00:17:33.370
Now, this sounds ridiculous.

00:17:33.370 --> 00:17:36.550
But it was so radical that the
rumor that the crazy ecommerce

00:17:36.550 --> 00:17:38.550
team was painting
their walls spread

00:17:38.550 --> 00:17:41.460
throughout the entire
building like a wildfire.

00:17:41.460 --> 00:17:44.881
And people kept showing up at
our door with a mug of tea,

00:17:44.881 --> 00:17:46.380
on the pretense
that they would just

00:17:46.380 --> 00:17:48.963
want to check on something, to
see whether it was really true.

00:17:51.639 --> 00:17:53.180
Unfortunately, the
wider organization

00:17:53.180 --> 00:17:55.900
remained unchanged.

00:17:55.900 --> 00:17:59.180
And in the end, I wasn't
patient enough, not savvy enough

00:17:59.180 --> 00:18:02.670
in corporate politics, to
be successful long-term

00:18:02.670 --> 00:18:04.330
in that kind of environment.

00:18:04.330 --> 00:18:06.836
So I left for Google.

00:18:06.836 --> 00:18:08.210
And when I walked
into Google, it

00:18:08.210 --> 00:18:10.260
wasn't just the primary
colors of the logo

00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:12.500
and the bouncy balls in the
hallway that reminded me

00:18:12.500 --> 00:18:13.000
of eToys.

00:18:16.610 --> 00:18:19.060
So far, I've talked
mostly about why

00:18:19.060 --> 00:18:21.540
it's so important to
teach ourselves bravery

00:18:21.540 --> 00:18:24.710
and how to practice it in
our work and in our lives.

00:18:24.710 --> 00:18:27.960
But arguably, it's even more
important to teach bravery

00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:33.450
to the next generation,
especially our girls.

00:18:33.450 --> 00:18:35.880
Reshma Saujani, the
founder of Girls Who Code,

00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:39.610
gave the really brilliant
TED Talk a few weeks ago

00:18:39.610 --> 00:18:41.400
where she talked about this.

00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:42.930
And she talked
about how boys are

00:18:42.930 --> 00:18:47.090
taught to climb trees and fall
off and graze their knees,

00:18:47.090 --> 00:18:50.770
while girls are taught
to be pretty and perfect.

00:18:50.770 --> 00:18:53.090
And she talked about
how in their camps,

00:18:53.090 --> 00:18:56.270
the boys have no problem
with sharing imperfect work,

00:18:56.270 --> 00:18:58.980
whereas the girls would
rather show a blank screen

00:18:58.980 --> 00:19:02.199
than show their attempts
at solving a coding problem

00:19:02.199 --> 00:19:03.490
where they feel they've failed.

00:19:06.220 --> 00:19:08.740
My daughter is two
years old, and I'm

00:19:08.740 --> 00:19:11.680
proud to say that she's
a fearless climber.

00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:13.487
I found this out
last summer, when

00:19:13.487 --> 00:19:15.320
I was chatting to a
friend in the playground

00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:17.944
and not paying attention.

00:19:17.944 --> 00:19:19.610
Another parent tapped
me on the shoulder

00:19:19.610 --> 00:19:23.400
and said, very disapprovingly,
is that your child

00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:24.937
on the top there?

00:19:24.937 --> 00:19:27.270
And I turned around to see
her on the top of the big kid

00:19:27.270 --> 00:19:29.719
climbing structure.

00:19:29.719 --> 00:19:32.010
And the boy on the right is
her eight-year-old brother.

00:19:32.010 --> 00:19:33.992
But you see, she's
higher than him.

00:19:33.992 --> 00:19:35.285
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:36.150 --> 00:19:40.140
I was very scared at this
point, and I ran over.

00:19:40.140 --> 00:19:43.283
But then I also felt very
proud, so I took a photo.

00:19:43.283 --> 00:19:45.255
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:46.740 --> 00:19:50.010
And that, on the right,
is Cosima just last week

00:19:50.010 --> 00:19:51.520
at the climbing gym.

00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:55.180
She's about 2 meters
up the wall, where

00:19:55.180 --> 00:19:56.770
she's running out of boulders.

00:19:56.770 --> 00:20:00.090
Because that's how high they
make the kids' climbing wall.

00:20:00.090 --> 00:20:05.890
Now, I hope she will always
climb on, all her life.

00:20:05.890 --> 00:20:08.450
You are all building
incredible things.

00:20:08.450 --> 00:20:10.690
But what I hope
I've done today is

00:20:10.690 --> 00:20:13.800
to inspire you to kill
some things along the way.

00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:14.570
Thank you.

00:20:14.570 --> 00:20:16.805
[APPLAUSE]
