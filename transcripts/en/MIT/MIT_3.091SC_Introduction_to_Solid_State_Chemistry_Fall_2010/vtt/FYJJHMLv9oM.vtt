00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:22.790
Hi there.

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:23.750
I'm Brian.

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:26.960
We're going to be doing problem
number 7 of the 2009

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.880
final examination.

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.460
So the way I like to approach
these problems is to identify

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:35.720
what I think is important to
know before attempting them.

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:37.670
Things that you should review
that will help you

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:39.320
successfully navigate
the problem.

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:42.430
I call this the what
I need, W I N.

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:44.470
So for this particular problem,
which I think of as

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:47.590
the phase diagram problem, you
need three things critically

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:50.610
in order to successfully
complete it.

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.240
Number one you need to have a
general understanding of what

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:56.400
a phase diagram is, how to read
it, how to write it, how

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.890
to interpret the information
it gives you.

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.430
You can find a lot of this in
chapter 9 of Shackleford.

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.670
Along the same lines you should
probably know how to go

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.230
in between binary and unary
phase diagrams. How they are

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:10.150
related at least. In this
problem it's not absolutely

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:11.490
necessary to know this.

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.440
But in similar problems we might
ask, this is critical to

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:17.050
understand how these two
are interrelated.

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:19.850
The second thing you should
know is some language like

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:21.610
critical point and
triple point.

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:24.700
Where these are and what they
mean on the phase diagram.

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:27.210
And the third thing is the
phase coexistence.

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.160
So what does that
actually mean?

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:30.780
How do you find it on
the phase diagram?

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:36.180
So with these three particular
points, I'd review them and

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.720
then I would recommend
attempting the problem

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:39.370
afterwards.

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:42.040
So we're going to start
the problem.

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:43.280
We're going to start
over here.

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.160
I'm actually going to start this
from a reverse direction.

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:49.520
And review really quick what
a binary phase diagram is.

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.850
because this is actually the
phase diagram which you will

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:55.560
see most often as you progress
in your career as a scientist

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:56.940
or an engineer.

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:58.270
This is something you'll
see a lot of the time.

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:00.940
It'll have either one element
and another element.

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:03.940
Or one compound and another
compound along the axis.

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:08.220
And it shows the different
phases which exist at certain

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.200
temperatures and compositions.

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.720
So in general it's important
to sort of understand

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.970
what a phase is.

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:18.800
So a phase, is a chemically and
a structurally homogeneous

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.790
material given certain
state conditions.

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:25.540
So a phase diagram depicts
picks all these phases.

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:29.380
It's the master plot of phases
that are in equilibrium given

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:32.620
a particular set of
state conditions.

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.560
When I say state conditions
I'm actually referring to

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.410
things like temperature,
pressure, I even sometimes

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:41.110
consider composition to be one
of those state conditions.

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:45.210
So in a binary phase diagram,
what we're looking at is the

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:48.100
temperature versus
the composition.

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:51.040
So if you have some composition
of silicon and

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.850
germanium at some temperature,
you know exactly what phase it

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:55.255
should be at thermodynamically.

00:02:55.255 --> 00:02:58.090
It doesn't actually mean it
will be, but it should be.

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:00.750
So that's what a binary phase
diagram looks like.

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:03.050
So this is something you'll
see a lot and this is

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:05.230
something you probably will
become used to seeing a lot as

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:06.620
you go on in your years.

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:08.530
We're going to come back
to this in a second.

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:10.210
But first, for now, we're going
to it actually attempt

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:11.540
the problem that's given.

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:14.810
And then I'll tie both of
those together for you.

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:17.310
So let's go over and
let's actually look

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:18.070
at the problem now.

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:20.350
We'll go back to that
in a second.

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:23.090
We're asked to draw a unary
phase diagram for silicon.

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:25.190
And we're given some critical
information.

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:28.800
Specifically on the problem
we're given the triple point,

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:30.910
we're given the critical
point, and we're

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:32.280
asked to draw this.

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.610
Not to scale, of course,
but what it should

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:36.650
generally look like.

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:39.840
So the first thing I do
is label my axes.

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.630
Pressure, temperature.

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:44.260
And then we're given
certain data.

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:45.900
So I'm just going to throw it
down right in the beginning.

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.230
We're given pressure and
temperature for triple point.

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:49.570
We're given pressure
and temperature for

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:50.530
the critical point.

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:52.300
So I'm going to put those
points down right now.

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:54.350
Because I know that's
part of the answer.

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:56.160
So let me first put down
the triple point.

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:05.880
We're told the triple point
occurs at 0.15 atm.

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:12.530
And we're told that that is at a
temperature of 1415 celsius.

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:14.700
So temperatures are going
to be in celsius and our

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:16.690
pressures are going to
be in atmospheres.

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:23.680
So we're going to go up
to find this point.

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.020
In fact I'm going to give
it a different color.

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:33.160
That is our triple point.

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:35.870
I'm next going to plot the
critical point here.

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:40.100
We're told that that occurs
at a pressure of 6,600.

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:41.570
So not to scale of course.

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:43.170
But that's going to be somewhere
all the way up here.

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:55.760
Now we're told that that is
at a temperature of 4880.

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:58.330
So here's a point here.

00:04:58.330 --> 00:04:59.645
So we've just put
two points down.

00:04:59.645 --> 00:05:01.500
But that's not enough to
complete the problem.

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:03.150
It doesn't actually answer
all the questions.

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:06.630
The problem actually also asks
us to provide the normal

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:10.590
boiling point and the normal
melting point of silicon.

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:12.570
So you're not actually given
those temperatures because

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:13.350
you've got to be clever.

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:15.880
And all the students in our
class are given a periodic

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:17.150
table during the exam.

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:18.780
So I would encourage you to
have a periodic table with

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:20.020
this type of data.

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:22.720
So if you look at the periodic
table for silicon you can then

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:24.510
find your melting point
and you can find

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:26.370
your boiling point.

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:30.520
So this data, a normal melting
point and a normal boiling

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:32.460
point will occur at
1 atmosphere.

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:35.840
Let me just put 1 atmosphere
on the pressure here.

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:37.090
Again not to scale.

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:44.500
So anything that occurs at this
particular pressure, this

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:47.250
isobaric line, is going
to be normal.

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:53.730
So our normal melting point
occurs at 1414, which is right

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:56.050
next to 1415.

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:57.730
There we go.

00:05:57.730 --> 00:06:01.700
And our normal boiling
point occurs at 3265.

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:03.690
These are approximate numbers.

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:04.940
So we'll put that here.

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:10.940
And now if you've seen a unary
phase diagram before, which I

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:12.530
hope you have during your
studying, you'll know that it

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:15.530
looks somewhat like a y shape.

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:17.340
So one thing we're going to do
now is we're going to connect

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:18.260
these dots.

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:20.640
We know that at very high
temperatures we're going to

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:23.510
have what's a gas, basically.

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:26.160
And at very low temperatures
we're going to have something

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:28.090
like a solid.

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:30.340
And we have some liquid
in the middle.

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:33.220
And the way we're going to
delineate these phases is to

00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:34.470
connect these dots.

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:46.850
And this is what our unary
phase diagram is

00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:48.410
going to look like.

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:51.760
So in order to complete this
problem-- it was actually not

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:54.230
too bad of a problem-- all you
have to do is label some

00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:56.640
particular aspects
of this graph.

00:06:56.640 --> 00:07:00.400
So number 1, we have a solid
region, we have a gas region.

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:02.500
That implies this must
be the liquid region.

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:04.140
I'll put an L there.

00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:08.860
You're asked to identify 1,
2 and 3 component regions.

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:11.270
Or three 1-phase regions,
2-phase regions.

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:14.640
So number 1, you could have
chosen for a 1-phase region,

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:17.960
you can chosen a point here in
the gas, a point here in the

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:20.890
liquid, or a point here
in the solid.

00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:23.470
I'll just choose
one in the gas.

00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:28.290
So something here, let's call
that i, for answering part i.

00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:32.090
You could have chosen a point
along any of these lines for a

00:07:32.090 --> 00:07:33.100
2-phase equilibrium.

00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:36.370
Which implies that at that
point, so at that specific

00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:39.990
pressure and at that specific
temperature, you have both

00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:40.710
phases of equilibrium.

00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:42.280
Let me just choose one
and explain it.

00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:45.250
So let's choose something
here.

00:07:45.250 --> 00:07:48.355
Between 0.15 and 1.

00:07:48.355 --> 00:07:50.350
So let's choose this point.

00:07:50.350 --> 00:07:52.940
There we are.

00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:56.500
So at this point, at whatever
pressure we're at and whatever

00:07:56.500 --> 00:07:59.970
temperature we're at here, we
have both liquid and gas in

00:07:59.970 --> 00:08:00.570
equilibrium.

00:08:00.570 --> 00:08:02.540
They both coexist. You're
not tending

00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:03.970
towards one or the other.

00:08:03.970 --> 00:08:05.370
They're both there.

00:08:05.370 --> 00:08:09.560
So that's part B, the 2-phase
coexistence area.

00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:11.300
So we put that here.

00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:12.660
i i.

00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:14.190
And the third part
is the 3-phase

00:08:14.190 --> 00:08:15.680
coexistence, which is--

00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:18.540
almost you can pull it out of
the name-- the triple point.

00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:20.820
At the triple point-- and
there's only one of these--

00:08:20.820 --> 00:08:23.530
you have all three,
gas, liquid and

00:08:23.530 --> 00:08:25.680
solid coexisting together.

00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:26.960
So we've already sort
of made that.

00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:29.740
That was our blue dot.

00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:30.940
1, 2, 3.

00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:33.090
That's that point right there.

00:08:33.090 --> 00:08:34.140
So not to scale.

00:08:34.140 --> 00:08:34.940
But this is the answer.

00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:36.110
This is full credit.

00:08:36.110 --> 00:08:38.690
One thing that's really
interesting to note is that on

00:08:38.690 --> 00:08:41.847
this particular answer we have
a negative slope on our

00:08:41.847 --> 00:08:44.240
solid-liquid coexistence line.

00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:46.320
Now you've probably seen this
before in your studying and it

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:48.000
occurred with water.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.400
Most materials actually will
have a positive slope.

00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:52.860
If you think about it it's
sort of counterintuitive.

00:08:52.860 --> 00:08:56.070
What this implies is that if I'm
at a constant temperature

00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:59.670
and as I raise my pressure I'm
going to go from the solid to

00:08:59.670 --> 00:09:00.680
the liquid.

00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:03.170
Intuitively, we would think that
the solid is more densely

00:09:03.170 --> 00:09:05.970
packed and therefore as we
increase the pressure we're

00:09:05.970 --> 00:09:07.590
going to tend towards a solid.

00:09:07.590 --> 00:09:10.590
That's not the case in water and
in this problem is not the

00:09:10.590 --> 00:09:13.370
case with the data we're
given for silicon.

00:09:13.370 --> 00:09:15.740
In this case as we raise the
pressure we're actually

00:09:15.740 --> 00:09:16.630
turning into a liquid.

00:09:16.630 --> 00:09:18.410
It's kind of counterintuitive.

00:09:18.410 --> 00:09:21.550
Another way of actually saying
that is the liquid phase at

00:09:21.550 --> 00:09:24.850
this particular temperature
is more dense

00:09:24.850 --> 00:09:26.240
than the solid phase.

00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:28.270
And you see that with water,
which is why ice

00:09:28.270 --> 00:09:30.020
floats on top of water.

00:09:30.020 --> 00:09:32.390
So that is our unary diagram.

00:09:32.390 --> 00:09:34.710
That is the full credit
on this problem.

00:09:34.710 --> 00:09:37.360
I do want to tie it in really
quick though, with what a

00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:38.160
binary diagram is.

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:41.040
Because this is a very important
concept to get and a

00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:42.440
potential problem.

00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:45.160
So we're going to go back
over to binary phase

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:46.410
diagram over here.

00:09:49.750 --> 00:09:52.810
And so what we're looking at on
this binary phase diagram

00:09:52.810 --> 00:09:55.590
is actually, it's the
temperature versus the

00:09:55.590 --> 00:09:57.920
composition at a specific
pressure.

00:09:57.920 --> 00:10:00.920
Now for a binary phase diagram
you're going to assume--

00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:02.500
unless you're told otherwise--

00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:05.740
that it occurs at 1
atm, 1 atmosphere.

00:10:08.420 --> 00:10:10.970
If I want to go between the
binary and the unary that we

00:10:10.970 --> 00:10:14.670
just looked at, you need
to add your third axis.

00:10:14.670 --> 00:10:16.570
So if we had a third axis--

00:10:16.570 --> 00:10:17.470
let me draw that here.

00:10:17.470 --> 00:10:18.720
This is going to
be our z-axis.

00:10:21.850 --> 00:10:23.240
There's the z.

00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:27.070
We know that if we put a
pressure along this axis,

00:10:27.070 --> 00:10:29.520
we're going to be able to
extract what we had for our

00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:30.300
unary diagram.

00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:33.500
So let me do that for you.

00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:38.050
I'm going to call this
the pressure axis.

00:10:38.050 --> 00:10:41.480
Going back in and out
of the board.

00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:43.720
And actually this is at 1 atm.

00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:45.360
Which implies at some
point farther

00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:48.000
back we have the origin.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:49.290
You can just do this
lightly so it

00:10:49.290 --> 00:10:50.520
doesn't get too confusing.

00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:51.870
We have an origin for
our pressure.

00:10:51.870 --> 00:10:54.120
So at this point we
have 0 pressure.

00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:55.950
We don't work with negative
pressures.

00:10:55.950 --> 00:10:57.000
0 pressure.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.920
Which implies-- let me just
draw the Cartesian form of

00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:04.600
this-- so we have composition,
we have

00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:07.180
temperature, we have pressure.

00:11:07.180 --> 00:11:09.770
That's our x, y, z.

00:11:09.770 --> 00:11:13.480
Now what happens is that as we
increase pressure what happens

00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:15.560
to, for example, this point?

00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:17.330
Now what is this point?

00:11:17.330 --> 00:11:18.870
This point is the point
where we go from the

00:11:18.870 --> 00:11:21.240
solid to the liquid.

00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:22.600
That's the melting point.

00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:25.920
What happens to the melting
point as we increase or

00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:27.310
decrease our pressure?

00:11:27.310 --> 00:11:30.650
Well that information is given
on our unary phase diagram.

00:11:30.650 --> 00:11:31.900
Let's go back really quickly.

00:11:35.270 --> 00:11:38.200
As we increase our pressure we
can see that what's going to

00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:42.280
happen with our point is
it's going to go up.

00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:45.150
So what basically we have to
do is we need to take-- you

00:11:45.150 --> 00:11:46.610
have to think
three-dimensionally--

00:11:46.610 --> 00:11:50.360
and take this graph and you're
going to take it an spin it

00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:52.450
and put it on to one of
those planes there.

00:11:52.450 --> 00:11:53.410
So we're going to get an idea.

00:11:53.410 --> 00:11:56.670
This is something that I would
challenge you, the listener,

00:11:56.670 --> 00:11:59.800
to do and think about and do
on your paper after you've

00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:01.480
completed this problem
successfully.

00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:02.705
I'm going to draw
it right now.

00:12:02.705 --> 00:12:04.290
And I'm going to let you
look at it and think

00:12:04.290 --> 00:12:07.080
about it, what it means.

00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:08.670
So let me do that.

00:12:08.670 --> 00:12:10.570
Let's take a look now.

00:12:10.570 --> 00:12:12.210
This is our temperature axis.

00:12:12.210 --> 00:12:13.360
Here's t.

00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:15.110
Here's p.

00:12:15.110 --> 00:12:18.370
Remember unary was p versus
t, so you've got

00:12:18.370 --> 00:12:19.770
to do a little flipping.

00:12:19.770 --> 00:12:21.020
But let me just draw it now.

00:12:29.912 --> 00:12:31.640
It kind of goes up
to the words.

00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:33.490
But you get the idea.

00:12:33.490 --> 00:12:35.640
This is-- if you do a little
flipping and I challenge you

00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:37.680
to do that, some
three-dimensional thinking--

00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:40.710
this is the unary phase plot
that we gave for our answer.

00:12:40.710 --> 00:12:43.390
And the point I'm trying to
make is that you can go in

00:12:43.390 --> 00:12:47.650
between your unary and your
binary diagrams by

00:12:47.650 --> 00:12:48.630
understanding that.

00:12:48.630 --> 00:12:52.710
For example, binary diagram is
at a constant pressure and

00:12:52.710 --> 00:12:56.050
your unary diagram, unary
means that it has one

00:12:56.050 --> 00:12:58.190
material, one composition.

00:12:58.190 --> 00:13:01.590
So in this particular problem
I've created germanium to be

00:13:01.590 --> 00:13:03.170
our b element.

00:13:03.170 --> 00:13:07.210
And we're operating here
with pure silicon.

00:13:07.210 --> 00:13:08.880
So you can go in between
if you have the

00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:10.380
grasp of that concept.

00:13:10.380 --> 00:13:12.720
So I would challenge you
to think about that.

00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:14.510
If you've gotten the problem
right and you understand this

00:13:14.510 --> 00:13:17.570
concept, I think you're good
to go on phase diagrams.
