00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:04.800
Now that we have seen how, the semantic network knowledge representation,

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:09.250
enables problem solving, let us return to that earlier problem that we

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:14.280
were talking about. The problem of A is to B, as C is to 5.

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.390
Recall that we have worked out the representations for both A is to B and

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:22.690
C is to 5. The question now becomes, whether we can use this representation,

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:26.520
to decide whether or not 5 is the correct answer. If we look at

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:30.630
the two representations in detail, then we see part of the representation here,

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.980
is the same as the representation here. Except that, this part is different from

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:41.080
this part. Here we have y expanded and right here, we have s remain unchanged.

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:44.776
So this may not be the best answer. Perhaps there is a better answer. Where

00:00:44.776 --> 00:00:47.950
the representation on the left, will exactly match representation on the right.
