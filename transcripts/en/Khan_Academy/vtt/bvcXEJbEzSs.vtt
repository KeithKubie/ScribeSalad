00:00:00.877 --> 00:00:02.720
- [Voiceover] Let's now
see if we can convert

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:06.221
a larger decimal representation to binary.

00:00:06.221 --> 00:00:10.739
So let's say that we have the number 114

00:00:10.739 --> 00:00:12.673
and this is its decimal representation.

00:00:12.673 --> 00:00:14.106
See if you can pause the video

00:00:14.106 --> 00:00:17.781
and rewrite this in its
binary representation.

00:00:18.555 --> 00:00:21.524
So I'm assuming you have at least tried.

00:00:21.524 --> 00:00:23.731
Now we can work on this together.

00:00:23.731 --> 00:00:26.277
So as always, we just
want to decompose this

00:00:26.277 --> 00:00:28.404
into the sum of powers of two.

00:00:28.404 --> 00:00:31.306
You can always decompose
this and any number

00:00:31.306 --> 00:00:34.495
into a sum of powers of two.

00:00:34.495 --> 00:00:37.262
We can once again just remind
ourselves the powers of two.

00:00:37.262 --> 00:00:41.051
Two to the zero is one, two
to the first power is two,

00:00:41.051 --> 00:00:43.437
two to the third power is eight,

00:00:43.437 --> 00:00:45.207
two to the fourth power is 16,

00:00:45.207 --> 00:00:50.207
two to the fifth power is 32,
two to the sixth power is 64,

00:00:51.318 --> 00:00:54.086
two to the seventh power is 128,

00:00:54.086 --> 00:00:55.456
and that gets us large enough.

00:00:55.456 --> 00:00:57.827
We've already gotten larger
than the number here.

00:00:57.827 --> 00:01:01.398
So let's see, 114 can be rewritten as,

00:01:01.398 --> 00:01:03.129
the largest power of two that is less than

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:06.745
or equal to that is 64.

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:11.003
So we can rewrite it as 64 plus,

00:01:11.003 --> 00:01:14.891
what's going to be left over, 64 plus 50,

00:01:14.891 --> 00:01:16.678
now we're going to have to rewrite 50

00:01:16.678 --> 00:01:18.952
as the sum of the powers of two.

00:01:18.952 --> 00:01:23.952
And let's see, 50 can be
rewritten as the largest power

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.338
of two that is less than
or equal to 50 is 32.

00:01:30.338 --> 00:01:35.338
So we can rewrite it as 32 plus,

00:01:36.141 --> 00:01:41.141
32 plus 18 and now we have to rewrite 18

00:01:42.099 --> 00:01:44.727
as the sum of some powers of two.

00:01:44.727 --> 00:01:48.263
Well 18, the largest power of two that is

00:01:48.263 --> 00:01:51.570
less than or equal to 18 is 16.

00:01:52.202 --> 00:01:56.846
So this is going to be
16 and then 16 plus,

00:01:56.846 --> 00:02:00.142
16 plus two, and lucky for
us, two, well I guess not

00:02:00.142 --> 00:02:02.245
that lucky, we had to do this a good bit,

00:02:02.245 --> 00:02:07.245
two is a power of two,
so we can rewrite this,

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:13.350
114 is equal to, lemme give
myself enough real estate here,

00:02:14.109 --> 00:02:19.109
is equal to 64 plus 32 plus 16 plus 2.

00:02:27.907 --> 00:02:31.871
I've just written 114 as
the sum of powers of two.

00:02:31.871 --> 00:02:34.823
And once again we can read
this as one 64 plus one 32

00:02:34.823 --> 00:02:38.185
plus one 16 plus one two.

00:02:38.185 --> 00:02:41.667
Now we're ready to really
rewrite this in binary.

00:02:41.667 --> 00:02:43.757
Let's just write the
different place values.

00:02:43.757 --> 00:02:46.754
So remember, this is the
ones, this right over here

00:02:46.754 --> 00:02:51.171
is the one's place value or
the one's place, I should say.

00:02:51.171 --> 00:02:53.028
Lemme just do this in a different color.

00:02:53.028 --> 00:02:58.028
So this is going to be the
ones, then we're gonna have

00:02:59.461 --> 00:03:04.461
the twos, then we're gonna have the fours,

00:03:06.612 --> 00:03:10.444
the four's place, then we're gonna have

00:03:10.444 --> 00:03:15.444
the eight's place, then we're
gonna have the 16's place,

00:03:19.924 --> 00:03:22.796
tells you how many 16s are in this number.

00:03:22.796 --> 00:03:27.796
Then we're gonna have the 32's place,

00:03:28.042 --> 00:03:29.991
how many 32s are in this number.

00:03:29.991 --> 00:03:33.689
And then you're going
to have the 64's place.

00:03:35.424 --> 00:03:38.582
So how many ones do we have
here? We have zero ones.

00:03:38.582 --> 00:03:42.109
How many twos do we have?
Well, we have one two,

00:03:42.109 --> 00:03:43.505
you're going to have one
of something or zero,

00:03:43.505 --> 00:03:46.636
there's only two digits if
you're thinking in binary.

00:03:46.636 --> 00:03:50.314
Now we have no fours, no fours here,

00:03:50.314 --> 00:03:52.738
and no eights, no eights.

00:03:52.738 --> 00:03:57.738
We have a 16, we have
a 32 and we have a 64.

00:04:02.323 --> 00:04:04.984
So in binary the number 114 in decimal?

00:04:04.984 --> 00:04:06.754
Would be in binary, would be written as

00:04:06.754 --> 00:04:10.754
one, one, one, zero, zero, one, zero.
