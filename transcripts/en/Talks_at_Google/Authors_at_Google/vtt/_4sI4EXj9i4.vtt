SPEAKER 1: Good afternoon.

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:12.240
Today at Google we're delighted
to welcome Mr. Robin Sloan.

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.840
Mr. Sloan grew up in Detroit
and attended Michigan State,

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:20.040
where he co-founded a literary
journal called "Oats."

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:23.460
After college, he went to work
at the intersection of media

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.710
and technology, first in
St. Petersburg, Florida,

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:28.560
at the Poynter
Institute, and then

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.400
in San Francisco at
current TV and Twitter.

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:35.550
His first novel, "Mr.
Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore,"

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.540
went on to become a "New
York Times" best seller.

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:40.800
And it was called
by George Saunders

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.030
a "tour de force," after
which Mr. Sloan has politely

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.240
requested that no further
commentary on his writing

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:49.540
be offered.

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:51.940
Ever.

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:55.120
He's here today to discuss
his second novel titled

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:56.889
"Sourdough."

00:00:56.889 --> 00:00:59.180
Please join me in welcoming
to Google, Mr. Robin Sloan.

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:00.599
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:00.599 --> 00:01:02.491
ROBIN SLOAN: Thanks.

00:01:02.491 --> 00:01:03.700
Hey, everybody.

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:05.533
Thanks for coming for
this, for getting out.

00:01:05.533 --> 00:01:08.270
It's a nice intimate
crowd here in the flesh.

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:11.510
But I understand there are some
more people watching virtually,

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:13.830
and of course, more
people online later.

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.120
So here's what I would
like to propose--

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:21.590
I want to tell you a couple
of stories about this book.

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:24.270
One about where the idea
came from in the first place.

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.330
And one about where this
book kind of ended up for me.

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.170
Kind of like where I ended
up maybe after writing it.

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:32.780
And then, I want to
offer something else.

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:34.580
It's actually pretty Googley.

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:36.754
This is something that I
do all over-- at bookstores

00:01:36.754 --> 00:01:37.670
and reading festivals.

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:40.550
But in a way, it's
even more apropos here.

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:43.010
And it's something that
I don't think you've ever

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:45.422
heard at a book reading before.

00:01:45.422 --> 00:01:46.880
And then, of course,
I'll have time

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.120
to answer some questions if you
have them and we'll wrap it up.

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:52.050
Does that sound
like a good plan?

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:53.550
OK.

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:59.660
So this new book "Sourdough"
came about shortly

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:01.214
after I had wrapped
up the manuscript

00:02:01.214 --> 00:02:03.380
for my first novel, which
was titled "Mr. Penumbra's

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.000
24-Hour Bookstore."

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.490
And I was in that state
of mind that follows--

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:11.690
I think only a first novel can
kind of put you in this space.

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:13.880
Because-- you guys might
have heard this before.

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.460
There's sort of a
saying or a cliche

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:20.210
about first novels, which is
that an author just opens up

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:23.930
their head and pours in
everything-- every thought

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:27.870
they've ever had, every dream
of a book they've ever dreamt.

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.014
Because you're not
sure you're ever

00:02:30.014 --> 00:02:31.430
going to get to
write another one,

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:32.820
so like this is your chance.

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:33.960
And you put it all in.

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:36.680
That was definitely the case
with me and my first novel.

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.840
And so then my brain was empty.

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:41.621
I had kind of put
it all out there

00:02:41.621 --> 00:02:44.120
and I had to figure out what I
was going to fill it up again

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.500
with to write this next book.

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.250
Of course, I am sure this is
true for a lot of the folks

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:52.140
in the audience here,
you're not struggling

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:53.390
to be interested in something.

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:55.520
You're actually interested
in too many things.

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:58.730
And so the challenge for me, at
that point, as I was beginning

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:00.530
to contemplate
this next book, was

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:03.590
what of all these different
paths am I going to choose?

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:07.340
And at that point, nothing
had really grabbed me

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:09.560
in that irresistible way.

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:11.920
So I'm thinking
about this stuff.

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:13.750
I'm sort of struggling
with the decision,

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:16.250
looking at all these interesting
things in the world and all

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:20.380
the different ways a novel could
go, when I went wine tasting.

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:21.710
I was up in Booneville.

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:23.840
Has anyone here ever
actually been to Booneville

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:24.960
up in Anderson Valley?

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:25.700
Yeah.

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:28.640
For those of you who haven't
been, well worth the trip.

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:30.140
It's about three hours north.

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:33.110
It's just this lovely
little green fold

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:37.970
of rustic wineries and
breweries and parks

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:39.890
and all sorts of
things like that.

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:43.160
I was up there tasting
wine at one winery

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:45.260
in particular--
tiny little place,

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.830
like a one-room
schoolhouse sort of.

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:50.460
They were very serious.

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:53.000
A little bit severe, actually,
in their whole approach

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.140
to wines.

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:58.340
Sort of unsmiling and like, you
should enjoy this and take it

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:00.080
very seriously.

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:02.060
And so they're pouring
one wine after another,

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:04.518
and they get to one somewhere
in the middle of this flight.

00:04:04.518 --> 00:04:08.510
And the person who is helping
us set out those largest wine

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:11.600
glasses, the ones that are
like the big sort of globular

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:14.480
forms with their really
sharp, skinny edge.

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:18.040
And as she pouring this
wine-- which was a red wine--

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:18.950
inky dark.

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:21.089
Just dark, dark red.

00:04:21.089 --> 00:04:23.910
She leaned forward a
little bit and her voice

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:26.340
was full of conspiracy--

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:27.900
I just remember this so well--

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:31.850
as she said to us,
very meaningfully,

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:38.540
"You know, this one
is a suitcase clone."

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:41.110
I see some looks sort of
confusion and consternation

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:42.045
in the audience.

00:04:42.045 --> 00:04:45.040
I don't know if anyone here
had ever heard those two

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:47.500
words juxtaposed before.

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:48.610
I had not.

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:52.720
But I really liked the sound
of it-- "suitcase clone."

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:55.720
So I actually, at
that time, whipped

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:57.160
my notebook out
of my back pocket,

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:59.110
my ever present
notebook, into which

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:02.320
I put all interesting words
and phrases I ever run across.

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:05.770
Street signs or people's
names or little things

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:07.942
you overhear in cafes.

00:05:07.942 --> 00:05:08.650
I whipped it out.

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:10.880
I said, hold on.

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:11.870
Say that again.

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:13.610
Suitcase clone?

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:15.260
OK.

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:18.040
What does that mean?

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:19.540
And so this is what she told me.

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:20.915
This is a real
thing, by the way.

00:05:20.915 --> 00:05:23.010
This is totally just
documentary truth

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:25.410
from the history
of California wine.

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:30.849
Turns out, decades ago,
especially around the time when

00:05:30.849 --> 00:05:33.390
California wine was starting to
take itself seriously as kind

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:36.930
of a peer to the wine makers
of the Old World-- you know,

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:39.090
France, Italy,
and all the rest--

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:41.460
in terms of quality, kind
of global reputation.

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:44.575
There was this thing
that people would do.

00:05:44.575 --> 00:05:45.450
So let's say it's me.

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:47.490
Let's say I'm up there
in Anderson Valley.

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:51.390
I have some acreage on the
side of a hill somewhere.

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:53.970
And I imagine
myself a wine maker.

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:57.080
I want to plant
some grapes there.

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:01.940
What I might have done is found
a friend, an acquaintance,

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:04.730
perhaps someone in this room,
a faithful reader of one

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:05.810
of my books.

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:09.680
And said, how would you
like to take a trip?

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:12.650
All expenses paid
vacation to France,

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:14.570
one of the great old
winemaking regions.

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:15.540
Bordeaux.

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:16.040
Go.

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:16.770
For a week.

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:17.870
Enjoy yourself.

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:18.830
Eat good food.

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:19.910
Drink good wine.

00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:20.810
Soak up the sun.

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:22.100
It'll be great.

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:24.500
So you do that.

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:26.210
You would have a good time.

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:31.070
But then, maybe, just maybe,
on the last day of your trip,

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:32.180
you could find yourself.

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:35.630
by chance, walking
down a path that

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:39.620
abuts one of those
great old vineyards.

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:41.360
Like, legendary.

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:44.430
Functioning for hundreds
of years in some cases.

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:48.800
And maybe haven taken that
path along that old vineyard,

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:53.240
you could suddenly notice
that your shoelace is untied.

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:56.300
And so then, of course,
you'll duck down low,

00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:58.640
below the level of the vines.

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:02.600
And from some pocket produce
a little pair of garden snips.

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:04.970
Even just a pocket knife.

00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:07.550
And you'll go snip, snip.

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:10.430
And take just a couple of
cuttings from these plants.

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:15.050
Then, you go back to the
B&amp;B. You take a towel.

00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:17.570
You wet it under the
tap, kind of wring it out

00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:20.660
so it's not too soggy wet.

00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:23.870
You wrap up those cuttings to
protect them for the journey

00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:27.080
ahead, put them at the
bottom of your luggage.

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:29.690
Stack all your
other stuff on top.

00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:32.720
And then book it
back to California.

00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:37.670
Very importantly, you do not
declare those grape cuttings

00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:39.050
at customs.

00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:41.930
Instead, you bring them to
me up in Anderson Valley,

00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:43.160
where I will take them.

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:45.320
I will graft them
onto American roots.

00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:46.160
Help them grow.

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:48.020
And then I'll cut and
graft, cut and graft,

00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:52.040
cloning that legendary
grape from whatever vineyard

00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:54.770
in Bordeaux all
across my vineyard.

00:07:54.770 --> 00:07:58.250
And so then I will have
exactly the same substance

00:07:58.250 --> 00:08:00.230
from which to make my own wine.

00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:02.660
As an aside, of course it's
not really the same substance.

00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:05.030
And in fact, the entire
thing is a little bit silly,

00:08:05.030 --> 00:08:07.370
because everything is different.

00:08:07.370 --> 00:08:08.289
The soil is different.

00:08:08.289 --> 00:08:09.330
The climate is different.

00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:12.180
All the choices I make in my
cultivation are different.

00:08:12.180 --> 00:08:15.800
But it has the
mystique, the aura.

00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:18.860
And one thing is
indisputably true,

00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:21.320
having done this whole
circuitous process,

00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:26.660
I do get to tell people decades
later in my tasting room,

00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:31.440
you know, this one
is a suitcase clone.

00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:33.190
So I don't know how
that story strikes you

00:08:33.190 --> 00:08:35.789
or what else it
makes you think of.

00:08:35.789 --> 00:08:41.190
I can report to you that kind
to my surprise, I was entranced.

00:08:41.190 --> 00:08:43.890
I was like, oh, I love it.

00:08:43.890 --> 00:08:46.200
I just loved the
feeling of it, I think.

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:49.350
The combination of
something that's very--

00:08:49.350 --> 00:08:50.610
or seems to be very--

00:08:50.610 --> 00:08:53.810
traditional and
familiar and grounded,

00:08:53.810 --> 00:08:54.790
like literally rooted.

00:08:54.790 --> 00:08:55.770
Like, come on.

00:08:55.770 --> 00:08:58.720
Like, grapes and winemaking.

00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:03.370
With the very strange and
kind of the secret and just

00:09:03.370 --> 00:09:05.950
the image of someone
like skulking

00:09:05.950 --> 00:09:08.410
through a vineyard at night
or smuggling something

00:09:08.410 --> 00:09:09.220
across borders.

00:09:09.220 --> 00:09:11.046
That kind of spy vibe.

00:09:11.046 --> 00:09:13.420
Those two things together
seemed to me really interesting

00:09:13.420 --> 00:09:16.812
and really magnetic, honestly.

00:09:16.812 --> 00:09:18.520
I mean, it was that
sense of irresistibly

00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:19.990
that I'd been looking for.

00:09:19.990 --> 00:09:24.220
So learning about the suitcase
clones up in Anderson Valley

00:09:24.220 --> 00:09:27.000
sent me on this hunt for
other stories like that.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:31.810
Other stories of normal or
traditional-seeming foods

00:09:31.810 --> 00:09:34.870
and other things we eat with
kind of a secret back story.

00:09:34.870 --> 00:09:38.890
I can report to you after doing
probably way too much research.

00:09:38.890 --> 00:09:41.110
At a certain point, my
reading on all this stuff

00:09:41.110 --> 00:09:44.747
turned into very
high-class procrastination.

00:09:44.747 --> 00:09:45.580
But I learned a lot.

00:09:45.580 --> 00:09:49.930
And I can report to you
now that the whole history

00:09:49.930 --> 00:09:53.720
of food and
cultivation and eating

00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:56.350
is more that than anything else.

00:09:56.350 --> 00:09:58.786
Like everything that seems
normal and natural now,

00:09:58.786 --> 00:10:00.285
everything that we
take for granted,

00:10:00.285 --> 00:10:06.190
it was all smuggled and stolen
and misappropriated and moved

00:10:06.190 --> 00:10:07.700
around the planet.

00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:12.190
So this whole kind of world
of stuff I was learning

00:10:12.190 --> 00:10:13.690
and all the stories
wrapped up in it

00:10:13.690 --> 00:10:17.320
were so seductive, so perfect,
and they sent me on this path

00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:19.037
to sort of writing this book.

00:10:19.037 --> 00:10:20.620
I want to give you
a quick sense, just

00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:23.200
a little tiny,
super short reading

00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:25.180
from the book of
how that came out

00:10:25.180 --> 00:10:28.300
the other end, like how some
of that emerged in the story.

00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:30.549
So I'm going to read
you this tiny bit.

00:10:30.549 --> 00:10:32.590
And what's happening here
is that the protagonist

00:10:32.590 --> 00:10:36.820
of this novel has found her way
into a super secret underground

00:10:36.820 --> 00:10:38.620
farmers market, where
all the people are

00:10:38.620 --> 00:10:42.310
doing strange new
innovative things with food.

00:10:42.310 --> 00:10:45.910
The most innovative
perhaps is a microbiologist

00:10:45.910 --> 00:10:49.300
who is actually splicing
the genomes of microbes

00:10:49.300 --> 00:10:52.030
in an effort to sort of
coax them into producing

00:10:52.030 --> 00:10:54.860
some new potent kinds of food.

00:10:54.860 --> 00:10:58.330
Some of her peers at this market
are understandably a little

00:10:58.330 --> 00:11:00.610
skeptical of this whole program.

00:11:00.610 --> 00:11:02.200
And they tell her, nope.

00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:03.640
We are not OK with this.

00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:04.870
We are not on board.

00:11:04.870 --> 00:11:06.880
What you're doing
is not natural.

00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:10.830
The microbiologist replies,
are you kidding me?

00:11:10.830 --> 00:11:13.024
Nothing is natural.

00:11:13.024 --> 00:11:14.690
And then following
that little argument,

00:11:14.690 --> 00:11:17.880
there's another exchange
between two other characters.

00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:20.870
And this is what they say--

00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:24.470
"After the microbe
sequencing session was over,

00:11:24.470 --> 00:11:27.006
I walked with Horace
through the grove

00:11:27.006 --> 00:11:28.130
at the heart of the market.

00:11:30.810 --> 00:11:35.030
'These are Meyer lemons,'
Horace said as we passed through

00:11:35.030 --> 00:11:36.750
the lemon grove.

00:11:36.750 --> 00:11:39.850
'They're named for
Frank Nicholas Meyer.

00:11:39.850 --> 00:11:42.820
He was Dutch by birth but an
agent of the United States

00:11:42.820 --> 00:11:44.490
government.

00:11:44.490 --> 00:11:46.725
He worked for the Department
of Agriculture's Office

00:11:46.725 --> 00:11:50.800
of Seed and Plant Introduction
before the First World War.

00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:53.790
And I thought of him
when Dr. [? Jana ?] Mitra

00:11:53.790 --> 00:11:57.070
spoke of her microbial survey.

00:11:57.070 --> 00:12:00.990
Meyer and his cohort were
hunters for larger prey.

00:12:00.990 --> 00:12:02.740
They crossed the
world and sent back

00:12:02.740 --> 00:12:05.350
living samples of
plants thought to be

00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:09.210
useful to the advancement
of the American economy.

00:12:09.210 --> 00:12:11.440
Meyer worked in China.

00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:15.310
He sent the first
soybean to America.

00:12:15.310 --> 00:12:16.840
And persimmons.

00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:19.360
Any persimmon grown
in this country today

00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:21.890
comes from that lineage.

00:12:21.890 --> 00:12:26.890
And of course, there are
these lemons named for him.

00:12:26.890 --> 00:12:29.270
Meyer died in China.

00:12:29.270 --> 00:12:35.420
He drowned in the Yangtze,
pushed from a river boat.'

00:12:35.420 --> 00:12:40.130
I looked at the lemon trees
with new found appreciation.

00:12:40.130 --> 00:12:43.760
Horace continued, 'He sent
these across the Pacific

00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:48.860
and the Spanish sent tomatoes
to Italy in the 16th Century.

00:12:48.860 --> 00:12:53.090
And the Portuguese--
chiles to India.

00:12:53.090 --> 00:12:56.090
Maybe a comet brought it all
the earth in the first place.

00:12:56.090 --> 00:12:57.830
Who knows?

00:12:57.830 --> 00:13:03.970
Oh, I quite agree with
Dr. [? Jana ?] Mitra.'

00:13:03.970 --> 00:13:08.050
He plucked a lemon from a tree.

00:13:08.050 --> 00:13:13.520
'Nothing is natural.'"

00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:16.730
So that's a big part of
the philosophy of this book

00:13:16.730 --> 00:13:19.100
and a lot of the sort of
characters and the work they do

00:13:19.100 --> 00:13:20.975
and the arguments they
have, kind of bound up

00:13:20.975 --> 00:13:22.735
in that question of
what is traditional?

00:13:22.735 --> 00:13:23.360
What is normal?

00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:24.620
What is natural?

00:13:24.620 --> 00:13:26.420
Maybe nothing really is.

00:13:26.420 --> 00:13:30.500
But of course, I've been telling
you about wine and grapes

00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:32.120
and suitcase clones.

00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:34.330
And the title of this book
is not the suitcase clone,

00:13:34.330 --> 00:13:35.270
it's "Sourdough."

00:13:35.270 --> 00:13:37.650
So what happened?

00:13:37.650 --> 00:13:40.870
As I was writing this book,
I discovered two things--

00:13:40.870 --> 00:13:43.470
one kind of personal, the other
one actually quite mechanical.

00:13:43.470 --> 00:13:45.570
The personal thing is
that I don't actually

00:13:45.570 --> 00:13:48.150
care about wine that much
or at least not enough

00:13:48.150 --> 00:13:51.230
to write a whole novel set
in kind of the world of wine

00:13:51.230 --> 00:13:52.470
and wine making.

00:13:52.470 --> 00:13:54.490
The mechanical thing, though--

00:13:54.490 --> 00:13:55.870
this is pretty nerdy.

00:13:55.870 --> 00:13:58.920
It kind of gets into the weeds
of how fiction comes together.

00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:01.560
But I think there's
people who tend

00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:03.300
to be interested in
this kind of stuff.

00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:05.220
I discovered something
that surprised me.

00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:08.450
I was trying to sort of sequence
these stories about wine

00:14:08.450 --> 00:14:10.320
and figure out how
things might happen

00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:12.570
and how you might discover
the secret of, say,

00:14:12.570 --> 00:14:15.870
this super mysterious
suitcase clone.

00:14:15.870 --> 00:14:18.180
And I realized that
almost by definition

00:14:18.180 --> 00:14:22.760
a story about winemaking
runs really slow.

00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:28.530
Its clock ticks year by year
by year, vintage by vintage

00:14:28.530 --> 00:14:29.400
by vintage.

00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:32.580
So again, almost by definition
the book you're going to write

00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:36.990
is going to be this sort
of slow generational story.

00:14:36.990 --> 00:14:39.390
And members of a
family are going

00:14:39.390 --> 00:14:41.940
to be getting older,
relationships shifting.

00:14:41.940 --> 00:14:44.470
They're going to be
harvesting grapes every year.

00:14:44.470 --> 00:14:48.210
And sure enough, you'll learn
things about this grape year

00:14:48.210 --> 00:14:48.940
by year.

00:14:48.940 --> 00:14:52.020
And eventually, someone
will kind of crack the code

00:14:52.020 --> 00:14:55.045
and its mysterious origins
will become apparent.

00:14:55.045 --> 00:14:57.420
But it's going to happen after
years and years and years.

00:14:57.420 --> 00:14:59.650
The dog-- the golden
retriever in the field,

00:14:59.650 --> 00:15:01.650
it's muzzle getting gray.

00:15:01.650 --> 00:15:05.910
And it's all sort of very warm
and nostalgic and all that.

00:15:05.910 --> 00:15:07.580
Sounds like an interesting book.

00:15:07.580 --> 00:15:09.330
I would probably read
that book, actually.

00:15:09.330 --> 00:15:10.830
But I didn't think
it was the kind

00:15:10.830 --> 00:15:13.140
of book that I wanted to
write or the kind that I'd

00:15:13.140 --> 00:15:14.760
be good at writing.

00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:19.770
The kind of books that I write
best, I think, at least so far,

00:15:19.770 --> 00:15:21.750
are books that are about now.

00:15:21.750 --> 00:15:25.530
Books about the moment we're in
and maybe kind of the next 15

00:15:25.530 --> 00:15:27.220
minutes into the future.

00:15:27.220 --> 00:15:29.130
That's just what I'm
interested in myself.

00:15:29.130 --> 00:15:30.910
That's what gets me excited.

00:15:30.910 --> 00:15:34.710
So figuring out how I was
going to anchor this story that

00:15:34.710 --> 00:15:37.860
was going to be about food
and eating and the mysteries

00:15:37.860 --> 00:15:40.140
and the secrets kind of
bound up in these worlds,

00:15:40.140 --> 00:15:44.130
it came almost like
balancing an equation

00:15:44.130 --> 00:15:46.490
from like middle school math.

00:15:46.490 --> 00:15:47.860
Like really, really simple.

00:15:47.860 --> 00:15:48.840
You've got some
things that you want

00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:50.790
to hold constant and
another value that you're

00:15:50.790 --> 00:15:51.800
trying to find.

00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:54.900
So the things I was holding
constant were the following--

00:15:54.900 --> 00:15:57.990
food and eating and
secret histories.

00:15:57.990 --> 00:16:01.680
I mean, that was what I had
gotten so fascinated by.

00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:05.610
I wanted the sort of
the core substance

00:16:05.610 --> 00:16:08.460
or the sort of sub-genre
of food and eating

00:16:08.460 --> 00:16:10.500
to be something I
actually cared more about

00:16:10.500 --> 00:16:12.510
and was more intrinsically
interested in myself

00:16:12.510 --> 00:16:16.601
and maybe something I
knew more about naturally.

00:16:16.601 --> 00:16:18.600
And finally, importantly,
it had to be something

00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:20.280
with a faster clock speed.

00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:22.530
Something that could
reveal its secrets.

00:16:22.530 --> 00:16:26.310
Something you could kind of work
with and ask questions about,

00:16:26.310 --> 00:16:30.060
not year by year by year,
but day by day by day,

00:16:30.060 --> 00:16:30.990
or even faster.

00:16:30.990 --> 00:16:33.210
You know, hour by hour by hour.

00:16:33.210 --> 00:16:36.870
And truly, I
discovered the solution

00:16:36.870 --> 00:16:38.430
that kind of balanced
this equation

00:16:38.430 --> 00:16:41.460
perfectly sitting there
in a scummy little Mason

00:16:41.460 --> 00:16:42.840
jar in my kitchen.

00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:44.970
And it was my sourdough starter.

00:16:44.970 --> 00:16:48.130
And for anyone who doesn't
know, which some people take it

00:16:48.130 --> 00:16:50.820
so for granted, but other people
actually never learned this.

00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:52.736
And I was one of them
until not that long ago.

00:16:52.736 --> 00:16:56.320
Sourdough starter is a little
community of microorganisms.

00:16:56.320 --> 00:16:58.770
You feed it every day, if
you're a sourdough baker.

00:16:58.770 --> 00:17:00.960
And it kind of rises and falls.

00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:03.810
And it's a key ingredient
in being sourdough bread.

00:17:03.810 --> 00:17:06.750
It gives it its texture by kind
of inflating and producing gas.

00:17:06.750 --> 00:17:09.790
It also gives it a lot of
its flavor just because

00:17:09.790 --> 00:17:13.530
of some of the chemicals that
these little microbes produce.

00:17:13.530 --> 00:17:18.660
And truly, it is less
ingredient and more roommate.

00:17:18.660 --> 00:17:23.460
It is like a little
gang of living organisms

00:17:23.460 --> 00:17:25.920
that you have to care
for and kind of respect

00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:27.499
their demands in some cases.

00:17:27.499 --> 00:17:29.790
So I realized that sourdough
was going to be it for me.

00:17:29.790 --> 00:17:31.890
Sourdough was going
to be the key.

00:17:31.890 --> 00:17:34.450
Because you can
use it every day.

00:17:34.450 --> 00:17:38.640
And just like a cutting
from a grape plant,

00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:41.820
a sourdough starter, in
it's little container,

00:17:41.820 --> 00:17:43.890
could of course be
something that someone

00:17:43.890 --> 00:17:47.550
smuggled across borders,
under cover of darkness.

00:17:47.550 --> 00:17:50.250
So that's the core of the story.

00:17:50.250 --> 00:17:53.670
It is, indeed, about a
mysterious sourdough starter

00:17:53.670 --> 00:17:58.860
that it soon becomes apparent
has properties, powers perhaps,

00:17:58.860 --> 00:18:02.490
that are much stranger than
your everyday San Francisco

00:18:02.490 --> 00:18:04.140
sourdough starter.

00:18:04.140 --> 00:18:08.690
I actually think that in the
history of English literature

00:18:08.690 --> 00:18:10.910
so far, as far as I
know-- as far as I've

00:18:10.910 --> 00:18:14.180
been able to kind of research--
this is the first novel

00:18:14.180 --> 00:18:18.590
to feature as a very
important supporting character

00:18:18.590 --> 00:18:22.220
a sentient sourdough starter.

00:18:22.220 --> 00:18:24.390
And I'm proud of
that distinction.

00:18:24.390 --> 00:18:28.670
So I want to share with you guys
something that kind of sprung

00:18:28.670 --> 00:18:31.730
immediately out of
that decision to anchor

00:18:31.730 --> 00:18:33.230
this book in the
sourdough starter,

00:18:33.230 --> 00:18:37.170
and something that's actually
very quite Googley, I think.

00:18:37.170 --> 00:18:40.190
So as you may or
might not know--

00:18:40.190 --> 00:18:44.210
might or might not know, audio
books are super popular, just

00:18:44.210 --> 00:18:46.290
like soaring popularity.

00:18:46.290 --> 00:18:48.920
They are the part of
the publishing industry

00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:49.730
that's growing.

00:18:49.730 --> 00:18:53.210
Everything else is kind of
maintaining and kind of trying

00:18:53.210 --> 00:18:57.260
to keep it together and stay
healthy and just kind of fight

00:18:57.260 --> 00:18:59.152
the tides of digital stuff.

00:18:59.152 --> 00:19:01.610
Audio books are this one great
exception where they're just

00:19:01.610 --> 00:19:03.410
going like gangbusters.

00:19:03.410 --> 00:19:06.290
So appropriately,
audio book producers

00:19:06.290 --> 00:19:08.450
are taking their task
really seriously.

00:19:08.450 --> 00:19:10.655
They're trying to produce
things that are not just

00:19:10.655 --> 00:19:12.920
kind of flat recitations
of the words on the page,

00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:15.230
but are productions
in their own right.

00:19:15.230 --> 00:19:17.420
So one of things they do
is they reach out to you--

00:19:17.420 --> 00:19:20.577
the author of a book about to be
transformed into an audio book.

00:19:20.577 --> 00:19:22.910
They ask you for something
different, something special.

00:19:22.910 --> 00:19:24.732
They want to make the
audio book distinct.

00:19:24.732 --> 00:19:26.690
So sure enough, for the
"Sourdough" audio book,

00:19:26.690 --> 00:19:28.522
I wrote a little
bit of extra text.

00:19:28.522 --> 00:19:30.980
Just a few little nuggets that
we kind of slipped in there,

00:19:30.980 --> 00:19:33.620
almost as like Easter eggs, for
people who listened to the book

00:19:33.620 --> 00:19:35.570
rather than read it on the page.

00:19:35.570 --> 00:19:37.115
But there's something else, too.

00:19:37.115 --> 00:19:38.990
That something else has
to do with the story.

00:19:38.990 --> 00:19:40.910
It has to do with the
sourdough starter.

00:19:40.910 --> 00:19:43.280
In my sort of
fictional imaginings

00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:45.710
it is brought to San
Francisco by a couple

00:19:45.710 --> 00:19:47.000
of mysterious brothers.

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:48.930
They are from a culture--

00:19:48.930 --> 00:19:52.310
pun not totally intended--

00:19:52.310 --> 00:19:54.830
that is very mysterious,
not known by many people.

00:19:54.830 --> 00:19:56.330
And it has a few
sort of things--

00:19:56.330 --> 00:19:59.330
hallmarks-- of its
people and its history.

00:19:59.330 --> 00:20:01.690
One of them is this particular
sourdough starter, which

00:20:01.690 --> 00:20:03.200
had been going for a long time.

00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:04.449
They bake their bread with it.

00:20:04.449 --> 00:20:06.890
And it is very, very good bread.

00:20:06.890 --> 00:20:09.110
But then to go along with
that, they have songs.

00:20:09.110 --> 00:20:11.690
They have a particular
genre of music.

00:20:11.690 --> 00:20:15.480
And they actually sing these
songs to the sourdough starter.

00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:17.784
And it's really important
to its development.

00:20:17.784 --> 00:20:19.700
And I mean, truly, these
two things together--

00:20:19.700 --> 00:20:20.990
the starter and the songs--

00:20:20.990 --> 00:20:22.280
they make the whole story go.

00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:24.690
Without them, nothing happens.

00:20:24.690 --> 00:20:28.070
This is just the story of a sort
of mildly depressed software

00:20:28.070 --> 00:20:29.940
engineer in San Francisco.

00:20:29.940 --> 00:20:33.680
So I talk about it so much and
I write so many descriptions

00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:35.004
of this music.

00:20:35.004 --> 00:20:37.170
This, of course, is the
great affordance of fiction.

00:20:37.170 --> 00:20:39.480
I can write something like--

00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:41.830
just for example--

00:20:41.830 --> 00:20:46.160
Lois pressed play
on the blank CD

00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:48.650
that one of the mysterious
brothers had given her.

00:20:48.650 --> 00:20:54.650
The music started to play slow
and sad, nothing but voices,

00:20:54.650 --> 00:20:59.000
curling together, in a language
that she didn't recognize,

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:05.500
but danced just on the
edge of legibility--

00:21:05.500 --> 00:21:06.500
And you're like, oh, OK.

00:21:06.500 --> 00:21:07.708
I can kind of hear it, right?

00:21:07.708 --> 00:21:09.310
I mean this is
how fiction works.

00:21:09.310 --> 00:21:12.280
You write something that kind of
gets the reader halfway there,

00:21:12.280 --> 00:21:15.010
and then you let them go
the rest of way themselves.

00:21:15.010 --> 00:21:19.060
Every novel exists
probably more than halfway

00:21:19.060 --> 00:21:22.880
towards the reader's mind than
the authors, which is amazing.

00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:26.590
I think this is why this is such
an amazing and powerful medium.

00:21:26.590 --> 00:21:31.060
But knowing that I
was describing music--

00:21:31.060 --> 00:21:34.455
audio-- this is an audio
book, I had the sense

00:21:34.455 --> 00:21:36.580
it was going to be frustrating
if somebody listened

00:21:36.580 --> 00:21:40.240
to the entire however many
dozens of hours of this thing

00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:42.910
and didn't get to hear
at least the tiniest

00:21:42.910 --> 00:21:45.290
whisper of this fictional music.

00:21:45.290 --> 00:21:46.300
It was like, come on.

00:21:46.300 --> 00:21:47.590
Seriously?

00:21:47.590 --> 00:21:51.580
So this was a challenge,
because we could not

00:21:51.580 --> 00:21:57.340
afford to hire the people
who invent Dothraki for "Game

00:21:57.340 --> 00:22:02.331
of Thrones," much less a choir
to perform it and then record

00:22:02.331 --> 00:22:03.580
it and play on the audio book.

00:22:03.580 --> 00:22:06.700
So we needed something a
little more rough and ready.

00:22:06.700 --> 00:22:09.310
Because I live and work here
in the San Francisco Bay area

00:22:09.310 --> 00:22:12.700
and am interested in code and
technology and all these things

00:22:12.700 --> 00:22:14.560
and have been
forever, and just am

00:22:14.560 --> 00:22:18.040
an inveterate kind of tinkerer
and explorer with these things,

00:22:18.040 --> 00:22:19.874
I knew about machine learning.

00:22:19.874 --> 00:22:21.790
I knew what some of the
tools were capable of.

00:22:21.790 --> 00:22:23.860
And I tinkered with
them a bit myself.

00:22:23.860 --> 00:22:26.000
And of course, as some of
you might already know,

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:28.720
one of the things that a
machine learning system can do

00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:31.120
is sort of extract patterns.

00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:33.160
You can give it this big
set of training data.

00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:36.192
It can be text; images;
indeed, even audio.

00:22:36.192 --> 00:22:37.150
And set this challenge.

00:22:37.150 --> 00:22:39.430
Say, I want you to
kind of figure out

00:22:39.430 --> 00:22:41.050
what the pieces of this are.

00:22:41.050 --> 00:22:44.020
What makes this the way it is?

00:22:44.020 --> 00:22:46.780
And then I want you to be able
to generate new things that

00:22:46.780 --> 00:22:48.430
fit those patterns.

00:22:48.430 --> 00:22:50.560
You're not allowed to
just copy and paste.

00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:52.662
You can't just playback
what I gave you.

00:22:52.662 --> 00:22:54.370
You've got to come up
with something new,

00:22:54.370 --> 00:22:59.320
but it has to kind of fit that
pattern in a really rough way.

00:22:59.320 --> 00:23:01.780
I'd run experiments with
text and the results

00:23:01.780 --> 00:23:05.050
were weird but
compelling, I thought.

00:23:05.050 --> 00:23:07.140
Actually, really
creatively provocative.

00:23:07.140 --> 00:23:10.420
And so I had the sense that
maybe I could apply this

00:23:10.420 --> 00:23:12.740
to the problem of the music.

00:23:12.740 --> 00:23:14.380
So just to kind of
get you up to speed

00:23:14.380 --> 00:23:16.840
where I was starting from,
there was a kind of music--

00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:18.340
or there is a kind
of music-- that's

00:23:18.340 --> 00:23:21.300
real that I had listened to
for years and really enjoyed.

00:23:21.300 --> 00:23:23.530
It was kind of in my
head when I was imagining

00:23:23.530 --> 00:23:27.970
this mysterious language and
this mysterious slow, sad music

00:23:27.970 --> 00:23:28.900
in the book.

00:23:28.900 --> 00:23:32.050
That kind of real music is
called Klapa, K-L-A-P-A.

00:23:32.050 --> 00:23:33.130
It's Croatian.

00:23:33.130 --> 00:23:35.879
It's all acappella,
sort of choral singing.

00:23:35.879 --> 00:23:36.670
It's really lovely.

00:23:36.670 --> 00:23:38.650
I'm going to play you
a little example here.

00:23:38.650 --> 00:23:40.750
And I think I can just
play it into my microphone

00:23:40.750 --> 00:23:42.010
and it'll work OK.

00:23:42.010 --> 00:23:45.146
This is real life
Croatian Klapa music.

00:23:45.146 --> 00:23:48.122
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:23:54.570 --> 00:23:55.630
It's nice.

00:23:55.630 --> 00:23:57.049
It also kind of
sounds like that.

00:23:57.049 --> 00:23:58.840
A big part of the appeal
for me, of course,

00:23:58.840 --> 00:24:00.810
is that do not
understand Croatian,

00:24:00.810 --> 00:24:03.447
so it has that
sort of opaqueness,

00:24:03.447 --> 00:24:05.030
like, oh, what are
they singing about?

00:24:05.030 --> 00:24:07.980
Oh, I don't know, but it's
so sort of melancholic

00:24:07.980 --> 00:24:09.000
and slow and sad.

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:10.210
I just love it.

00:24:10.210 --> 00:24:13.200
I knew we couldn't just put
Klapa in the audio book,

00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:15.450
because even if it kind
of does the trick for me,

00:24:15.450 --> 00:24:18.060
there's plenty of people in the
world who do speak Croatian.

00:24:18.060 --> 00:24:20.250
They'd be like, why is
their weird Croatian

00:24:20.250 --> 00:24:22.080
song in this audio book?

00:24:22.080 --> 00:24:23.626
The songs are all
about something.

00:24:23.626 --> 00:24:25.500
I mean, it just seemed
kind of in poor taste,

00:24:25.500 --> 00:24:28.230
in fact, to sort of take
somebody else's language

00:24:28.230 --> 00:24:29.130
and say, no, no, no.

00:24:29.130 --> 00:24:32.280
I'm going to use it as
my fictional stand in.

00:24:32.280 --> 00:24:35.160
Wanted to use this machine
learning method instead

00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:38.100
to create something that
was no language at all.

00:24:38.100 --> 00:24:39.330
No language on earth.

00:24:39.330 --> 00:24:43.890
So I took my collection of
Croatian Klapa mp3s, lovingly

00:24:43.890 --> 00:24:45.150
assembled over the years.

00:24:45.150 --> 00:24:47.530
Just this big kind of
junk pile of things

00:24:47.530 --> 00:24:50.040
I'd scraped from all
sorts of sources online.

00:24:50.040 --> 00:24:52.742
I fed those into
a neural network.

00:24:52.742 --> 00:24:53.700
And I set up this task.

00:24:53.700 --> 00:24:57.570
I was like learn the
patterns, like learn something

00:24:57.570 --> 00:24:59.770
of the essence that makes
this music what it is.

00:24:59.770 --> 00:25:03.990
And then use that to
generate some new music.

00:25:03.990 --> 00:25:05.616
So this is what I got.

00:25:05.616 --> 00:25:08.604
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:25:27.570 --> 00:25:29.830
So it's pretty weird.

00:25:29.830 --> 00:25:35.000
To my ear, at least, it is
weird in like the right way.

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:37.100
It has that sense.

00:25:37.100 --> 00:25:38.900
And there's reasons for this.

00:25:38.900 --> 00:25:40.400
You can hear the
human voices there.

00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:42.850
You can tell that that's
something human, the sort

00:25:42.850 --> 00:25:46.240
of syllables and phonemes
and little fragments,

00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:47.714
but it's not Croatian.

00:25:47.714 --> 00:25:48.880
It's definitely not English.

00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:50.440
It's, in fact, no
language at all.

00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:52.148
I think that's actually
sort of exciting,

00:25:52.148 --> 00:25:53.980
an exciting creative artifact.

00:25:53.980 --> 00:25:56.260
We could take the snippets
of this music-- oh,

00:25:56.260 --> 00:25:57.820
so I should complete
the thought.

00:25:57.820 --> 00:26:00.500
I generated a bunch of sounds
just like the ones you heard,

00:26:00.500 --> 00:26:02.710
like hundreds, most
of which were just

00:26:02.710 --> 00:26:05.380
too weird to kind
of even contemplate.

00:26:05.380 --> 00:26:09.370
But some of which, just
out of pure chance, kind of

00:26:09.370 --> 00:26:10.415
had a loveliness to them.

00:26:10.415 --> 00:26:12.040
Some interesting
things were happening.

00:26:12.040 --> 00:26:13.660
So I curated those down.

00:26:13.660 --> 00:26:14.860
I zipped them up.

00:26:14.860 --> 00:26:17.890
And I attached them to an email,
which I sent to the audio book

00:26:17.890 --> 00:26:19.310
producers.

00:26:19.310 --> 00:26:22.850
And I really, really hope that
that's like the weirdest thing

00:26:22.850 --> 00:26:24.430
they've ever gotten.

00:26:24.430 --> 00:26:26.810
And the task, I said, listen.

00:26:26.810 --> 00:26:29.470
This is actually kind of what I
imagine this music sounds like.

00:26:29.470 --> 00:26:32.080
So if you can find
some snippets in here

00:26:32.080 --> 00:26:34.900
that you can use, feel free to
cut and paste, and manipulate,

00:26:34.900 --> 00:26:36.109
do whatever you need to do.

00:26:36.109 --> 00:26:38.650
But maybe we can find a way to
slip this into the audio book.

00:26:38.650 --> 00:26:40.540
Sure enough, the audio
book for "Sourdough"

00:26:40.540 --> 00:26:44.020
is, as far as I know,
the first audio book ever

00:26:44.020 --> 00:26:51.070
to feature in its experience
the output of a neural network.

00:26:51.070 --> 00:26:52.540
Small distinctions.

00:26:52.540 --> 00:26:53.290
I will take them.

00:26:53.290 --> 00:26:54.962
I will always take
a small distinction

00:26:54.962 --> 00:26:56.170
that no one else cares about.

00:26:58.754 --> 00:27:01.170
There's one other thing I want
to share before I close out

00:27:01.170 --> 00:27:04.210
and answer some
of your questions.

00:27:04.210 --> 00:27:07.240
One of things I
learned producing all

00:27:07.240 --> 00:27:09.640
of these weird little tracks--

00:27:09.640 --> 00:27:11.390
of course, they were
always unpredictable.

00:27:11.390 --> 00:27:13.306
They just always had
sort of a different shape

00:27:13.306 --> 00:27:15.680
and a different sound.

00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:17.012
Of course, the way this works--

00:27:17.012 --> 00:27:18.470
some of you will
know this already,

00:27:18.470 --> 00:27:20.510
but for those of you who don't--

00:27:20.510 --> 00:27:22.010
it was all probabilistic.

00:27:22.010 --> 00:27:24.840
I always take great pains
describing this project

00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:27.560
not to use the word
artificial intelligence,

00:27:27.560 --> 00:27:30.860
because there are some things
that sort of are beginning

00:27:30.860 --> 00:27:33.420
to dance toward that boundary.

00:27:33.420 --> 00:27:36.110
Something that you really
could call like "AI."

00:27:36.110 --> 00:27:38.240
This, assuredly, is not.

00:27:38.240 --> 00:27:41.240
It's totally statistical
and kind of probabilistic.

00:27:41.240 --> 00:27:44.240
It's really just about
learning a statistical model

00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:45.860
of a particular thing.

00:27:45.860 --> 00:27:47.330
The way that works--

00:27:47.330 --> 00:27:49.492
it works the same way
with text, with images,

00:27:49.492 --> 00:27:51.450
with sound, when you're
using these techniques.

00:27:51.450 --> 00:27:53.280
If we're talking about text--

00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:56.060
and I had asked this thing
not to learn Croatian Klapa,

00:27:56.060 --> 00:27:58.940
but to learn Melville
or to learn Harry Potter

00:27:58.940 --> 00:28:01.472
or like any kind of
English prose, one

00:28:01.472 --> 00:28:02.930
of the things it
would have learned

00:28:02.930 --> 00:28:07.070
at the most basic level is that
given the letter T and then

00:28:07.070 --> 00:28:10.960
the letter H, the next
letter it ought to generate

00:28:10.960 --> 00:28:14.420
is almost certainly E or A or O.

00:28:14.420 --> 00:28:16.820
I mean, definitely a
vowel, something like that.

00:28:16.820 --> 00:28:20.930
It is definitely not-- or
with such a vanishingly low

00:28:20.930 --> 00:28:22.870
probability--

00:28:22.870 --> 00:28:26.640
Z or Q or X. And you
can imagine very easily

00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:29.440
kind of building a network
of all these probabilities

00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:32.260
as they all build one on
another on another on another.

00:28:32.260 --> 00:28:35.470
And eventually, you end up with
this really sort of interesting

00:28:35.470 --> 00:28:39.550
and powerful statistical model
of how you make a sentence

00:28:39.550 --> 00:28:41.020
from a Harry Potter book.

00:28:41.020 --> 00:28:44.740
It's really cool, but it's
also strangely simple.

00:28:44.740 --> 00:28:48.190
So one of things I
learned, to my surprise,

00:28:48.190 --> 00:28:50.940
is that following
that same model,

00:28:50.940 --> 00:28:52.585
one of these neural
networks trained

00:28:52.585 --> 00:28:54.580
on Croatian choral music--

00:28:54.580 --> 00:28:57.370
or I suspect any kind
of recorded music--

00:28:57.370 --> 00:28:59.020
one of the first
things it learns

00:28:59.020 --> 00:29:02.500
is that if it selects
a sample of silence

00:29:02.500 --> 00:29:05.590
or just like a really,
really quiet sample and then

00:29:05.590 --> 00:29:08.690
another sample of
silence, there's

00:29:08.690 --> 00:29:12.290
a very, very good chance,
it ought to next select

00:29:12.290 --> 00:29:13.990
another sample of silence.

00:29:13.990 --> 00:29:16.694
Because it turns out
little chunks of silence

00:29:16.694 --> 00:29:18.110
are one of the
most common things.

00:29:18.110 --> 00:29:20.510
It's one of the most
reliable sort of artifacts

00:29:20.510 --> 00:29:22.100
in any one of these files.

00:29:22.100 --> 00:29:24.740
There are the big silence
at the beginning, the fade

00:29:24.740 --> 00:29:25.730
out at the end.

00:29:25.730 --> 00:29:27.770
Even the spaces
between movements,

00:29:27.770 --> 00:29:30.200
or even in the case of this
choral music, the spaces

00:29:30.200 --> 00:29:32.825
where the whole choir takes
a breath, and they all go--

00:29:32.825 --> 00:29:33.325
[GASP]

00:29:34.600 --> 00:29:38.279
And it kind of just vanishes
into this void for a minute.

00:29:38.279 --> 00:29:39.820
And of course, these
neural networks,

00:29:39.820 --> 00:29:41.740
they don't have a sense
of the whole track.

00:29:41.740 --> 00:29:43.590
They only have a sense of this
small window they're looking

00:29:43.590 --> 00:29:45.100
at at any particular time.

00:29:45.100 --> 00:29:48.370
And so they become very,
very confident in silence.

00:29:48.370 --> 00:29:50.700
They're like, OK.

00:29:50.700 --> 00:29:51.730
One really quiet sample.

00:29:51.730 --> 00:29:52.670
Another quiet sample.

00:29:52.670 --> 00:29:54.415
Oh, I got this.

00:29:54.415 --> 00:29:55.290
Another quiet sample.

00:29:55.290 --> 00:29:57.280
And then having generated
that quiet sample,

00:29:57.280 --> 00:30:00.460
I'm even more sure that the
next one ought to be silent,

00:30:00.460 --> 00:30:02.330
and on and on and on.

00:30:02.330 --> 00:30:04.240
What that meant is
that very often, I

00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:07.824
would ask this neural network
to generate a new 30-second song

00:30:07.824 --> 00:30:08.740
or a minute-long song.

00:30:08.740 --> 00:30:10.256
It would kind of
churn and crunch.

00:30:10.256 --> 00:30:12.880
It would take a little while to
do that-- five minutes or seven

00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:13.467
minutes.

00:30:13.467 --> 00:30:14.800
And it would spit out this file.

00:30:14.800 --> 00:30:16.540
And I would very
excitedly hit play

00:30:16.540 --> 00:30:18.710
to see what the new
song was going to be.

00:30:18.710 --> 00:30:21.370
And I would hear--

00:30:21.370 --> 00:30:23.259
this totally confident nothing.

00:30:23.259 --> 00:30:25.300
So I got very used to kind
of just dragging those

00:30:25.300 --> 00:30:28.330
into the trash and trying again.

00:30:28.330 --> 00:30:32.380
There was, however, in addition
to the sort of very confident

00:30:32.380 --> 00:30:36.400
silent tracks and then the
sort of more interesting sort

00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:39.254
of bubbling percolating tracks,
like the one I played first,

00:30:39.254 --> 00:30:40.420
there was a third kind, too.

00:30:40.420 --> 00:30:41.600
And it actually
became my favorite.

00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:43.141
I just want to share
it with you now,

00:30:43.141 --> 00:30:47.220
because I think it's sort of a
remarkable creative artifact.

00:30:47.220 --> 00:30:50.460
Of course, these probabilities
are not definite.

00:30:50.460 --> 00:30:53.130
I mean, they're all just
sort of like values--

00:30:53.130 --> 00:30:56.100
smushy values on a wide scale.

00:30:56.100 --> 00:30:59.640
And so even if something has
a super small chance of ever

00:30:59.640 --> 00:31:04.460
happening-- you know 1/10,000
of 1% or whatever it is--

00:31:04.460 --> 00:31:08.160
you run the computer for long
enough and it can happen.

00:31:08.160 --> 00:31:11.130
So sure enough, some
of these files open up

00:31:11.130 --> 00:31:13.710
and the computers just locked
into this confident groove

00:31:13.710 --> 00:31:16.660
of silence, like, ha ha,
what could be easier?

00:31:16.660 --> 00:31:17.160
Yes.

00:31:17.160 --> 00:31:20.460
I have learned the secrets
of human composition--

00:31:20.460 --> 00:31:21.820
silence!

00:31:21.820 --> 00:31:23.880
And it goes on and
on and on and on.

00:31:23.880 --> 00:31:25.770
But in each one
of those samples,

00:31:25.770 --> 00:31:27.930
some calculation is being made.

00:31:27.930 --> 00:31:29.640
And who knows what happens?

00:31:29.640 --> 00:31:33.270
At one moment, something
trembles in the computer's

00:31:33.270 --> 00:31:37.680
little random number
generator and it

00:31:37.680 --> 00:31:40.321
sparks just enough
to tip a domino

00:31:40.321 --> 00:31:41.820
in a different
direction, and having

00:31:41.820 --> 00:31:44.700
tipped in that other direction,
we're off to the races.

00:31:44.700 --> 00:31:47.100
Because suddenly,
you're not calculating

00:31:47.100 --> 00:31:49.470
what's sort of most
confidently following

00:31:49.470 --> 00:31:51.482
silence but something else.

00:31:51.482 --> 00:31:52.440
And I love that moment.

00:31:52.440 --> 00:31:55.530
I think it's really
beautiful, actually,

00:31:55.530 --> 00:31:57.730
because there's
no reason for it.

00:31:57.730 --> 00:31:58.822
It just happens sometimes.

00:31:58.822 --> 00:32:00.030
I want to share one with you.

00:32:00.030 --> 00:32:02.220
This is a track that
I started playing,

00:32:02.220 --> 00:32:04.080
and at first, I
despaired, because I

00:32:04.080 --> 00:32:05.663
thought it was going
to be another one

00:32:05.663 --> 00:32:06.720
of these silent ones.

00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:07.780
But I was a little bit patient.

00:32:07.780 --> 00:32:09.863
And so I want you to be a
little bit patient, too.

00:32:09.863 --> 00:32:12.330
It's going to start with
silence, which is by design,

00:32:12.330 --> 00:32:16.470
but then you're going to hear
just a little ways in something

00:32:16.470 --> 00:32:22.094
in the universe trembles, and
we get something else instead--

00:32:22.094 --> 00:32:22.594
[BEEP]

00:32:27.564 --> 00:32:30.546
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:33:02.480 --> 00:33:05.460
No reason for any
of that to happen.

00:33:05.460 --> 00:33:06.960
But it did happen.

00:33:06.960 --> 00:33:08.120
And it's really lovely.

00:33:08.120 --> 00:33:15.830
And I have decided that I think
that is what "having an idea"

00:33:15.830 --> 00:33:16.757
sounds like.

00:33:16.757 --> 00:33:18.590
With that, I'll say
thank you for your time.

00:33:18.590 --> 00:33:19.952
[APPLAUSE]

00:33:22.417 --> 00:33:25.000
AUDIENCE: "Penumbra" had a lot
of interesting literary devices

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:28.030
in it, like from the short
story where the narrator is

00:33:28.030 --> 00:33:30.896
really unreliable and you never
see any exact quotes they have.

00:33:30.896 --> 00:33:32.770
So I'm kind of curious,
what literary devices

00:33:32.770 --> 00:33:34.780
should I be looking
forward to in this book?

00:33:34.780 --> 00:33:37.070
ROBIN SLOAN: Oh, that
is a good question.

00:33:37.070 --> 00:33:39.760
I don't know that I have
a direct answer, often

00:33:39.760 --> 00:33:43.300
because those tricky little
things emerge, sometimes

00:33:43.300 --> 00:33:45.095
even to my own surprise
in this writing.

00:33:45.095 --> 00:33:47.470
I kind of follow a feeling
and realize only in retrospect

00:33:47.470 --> 00:33:50.260
that I've hopefully done
something interesting.

00:33:50.260 --> 00:33:54.640
I did try to make the starter,
the sourdough starter,

00:33:54.640 --> 00:33:55.780
a character.

00:33:55.780 --> 00:34:00.430
I wanted it to be not just an
object but sort of a character

00:34:00.430 --> 00:34:02.350
with a will of its
own in the story.

00:34:02.350 --> 00:34:05.620
But I wanted to do so in
like a hard sci-fi way.

00:34:05.620 --> 00:34:06.580
It never talks.

00:34:06.580 --> 00:34:08.800
It never goes, "I am
the sourdough starter.

00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:10.900
Thank you for unlocking me."

00:34:10.900 --> 00:34:15.471
It operates in a way
that I think is credible.

00:34:15.471 --> 00:34:17.179
At a certain point,
it gets pretty weird.

00:34:17.179 --> 00:34:19.137
But I think it's all
within the realm of what's

00:34:19.137 --> 00:34:21.736
possible in our real universe.

00:34:21.736 --> 00:34:23.110
And so I guess
that's the thing I

00:34:23.110 --> 00:34:24.909
would say to look for--
the way that I have

00:34:24.909 --> 00:34:28.060
it sort of communicate
and talk and express

00:34:28.060 --> 00:34:29.799
its opinions to the narrator.

00:34:29.799 --> 00:34:30.340
I don't know.

00:34:30.340 --> 00:34:32.506
I don't know if I succeeded
in what I set out to do,

00:34:32.506 --> 00:34:35.440
but I wanted to make this
thing seem like a character

00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:39.560
without making it
like a cartoon.

00:34:39.560 --> 00:34:42.260
AUDIENCE: It seems like your
books span multiple genres.

00:34:42.260 --> 00:34:44.480
How would you classify them?

00:34:44.480 --> 00:34:46.460
ROBIN SLOAN: That's
a hard question.

00:34:46.460 --> 00:34:49.520
I don't really believe
in genres anymore.

00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:51.830
And I think there's
good reason not to.

00:34:51.830 --> 00:34:55.610
They're getting so blurred
and people are reading

00:34:55.610 --> 00:34:59.600
so deeply into one genre only
to extract ideas and then

00:34:59.600 --> 00:35:01.400
use them in a different genre.

00:35:01.400 --> 00:35:03.470
The books sit on the
fiction shelf, which I guess

00:35:03.470 --> 00:35:05.780
is the best shelf for them now.

00:35:05.780 --> 00:35:07.880
Earlier, I was chatting
with some other people

00:35:07.880 --> 00:35:11.640
about the idea of a new genre
called puzzle fiction, which

00:35:11.640 --> 00:35:14.080
I'm sort of newly excited about.

00:35:14.080 --> 00:35:19.629
But if there was a
shelf at a bookstore--

00:35:19.629 --> 00:35:21.170
it was like there's
the fiction shelf

00:35:21.170 --> 00:35:23.700
here and the
science-fiction shelf here.

00:35:23.700 --> 00:35:26.880
And then there was just a little
shelf that was between them,

00:35:26.880 --> 00:35:30.860
and it was for like
books both written by

00:35:30.860 --> 00:35:33.110
and I guess written
for people who

00:35:33.110 --> 00:35:35.840
love the contents of both
those shelves, that's

00:35:35.840 --> 00:35:38.980
the right home for I think
everything that I write.

00:35:38.980 --> 00:35:39.520
Well, cool.

00:35:39.520 --> 00:35:40.310
Thank you, guys, for your time.

00:35:40.310 --> 00:35:40.700
I really appreciate it.

00:35:40.700 --> 00:35:41.790
Thanks for coming out.

00:35:41.790 --> 00:35:44.081
And also, I'll be happy to
sign your books if you want.

00:35:44.081 --> 00:35:46.010
