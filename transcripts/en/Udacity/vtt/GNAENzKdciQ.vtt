Hi, I'm Ilya Grigorik, developer advocate, and web performance engineer at

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:07.070
Google. Which is to say, I like to make things fast.

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:08.570
&gt;&gt; And I'm Cameron Pittman. I'm a course

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:11.300
developer here at Udacity. Pretty new to web development,

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:12.820
which means I've made a few pages in the

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:14.970
past, but never optimized any of them for speed.

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:18.110
&gt;&gt; Developing a great website requires that you

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:19.680
understand your users and what they want to

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.680
achieve, but also how the browser works, so

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:24.140
you can build a fast and great experience.

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:25.630
&gt;&gt; Right. You know, I recently

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:28.900
ran my page through PageSpeed Insights. And I, well,

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:31.140
my score was pretty low, and I got some suggestions

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.230
I didn't quite understand. Like, for instance, how do

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:37.060
I remove render blocking JavaScript, and what are asynchronous scripts?

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:37.920
&gt;&gt; You know what, those are great

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.800
questions. And you're definitely not the only one.

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.530
Both of the optimizations that you've asked about

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:44.080
have to do with critical rendering path, which

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:48.030
is the sequence of steps the browser goes through to render the page. And I

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.240
think a lot of us take it for granted that the browser does all the work,

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:52.870
but once you understand how the browser

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:55.120
constructs dom, the cssom subject model layout

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:00.020
and paint, you can reliably build pages that rendered in less than one second.

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:02.940
&gt;&gt; Wow. One second. That is awesome. I would love to have all my

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.260
pages rendered in less than a second. What do I need to get started?

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.160
&gt;&gt; Well, to start how about an hour of your

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:11.370
time. We're going to take a ground up view of how the

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:14.480
browser constructs the page and once you know that I

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:16.470
think you'll be in great shape to answer your own questions

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:17.930
about how to optimize your own page.

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:19.390
&gt;&gt; Awesome. Let's do it.

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:20.780
&gt;&gt; Actually, one more thing before we get

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:23.430
started. I want you to write down some thoughts

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.600
about what you want to get out of this course and what you would like to learn.

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.800
&gt;&gt; Okay.
