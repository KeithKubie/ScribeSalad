because oddly enough philosophers who

because oddly enough philosophers who
 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.150
because oddly enough philosophers who
are famous notorious for being Mabel

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:08.160
are famous notorious for being Mabel
 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.669

I wanted to draw attention to how

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470
I wanted to draw attention to how
 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.349

philosophers actually go about their
 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.679
philosophers actually go about their
business and get them thinking more

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689
business and get them thinking more
 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:25.730

about the tools they use and how they
 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.859
about the tools they use and how they
use them a tool that everybody should be

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869
use them a tool that everybody should be
 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.959

and deduce something absurd from them

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370
and deduce something absurd from them
 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.160

that is you deduce a contradiction

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170
that is you deduce a contradiction
 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.959

like Superman which you know is absurd

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409

bother spelling it out you just say you

ridiculous consequence well let's look

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759
ridiculous consequence well let's look
 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.109
ridiculous consequence well let's look
at one of the great Grandaddy reductio

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119
at one of the great Grandaddy reductio
 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.300
at one of the great Grandaddy reductio
ad absurdum arguments of all times and

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310
ad absurdum arguments of all times and
 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.740
ad absurdum arguments of all times and
that's Galileo's proof that heavy things

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750
that's Galileo's proof that heavy things
 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.749
that's Galileo's proof that heavy things
don't fall faster than light things

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759
don't fall faster than light things
 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.719
don't fall faster than light things
believing in friction aside he argued as

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729
believing in friction aside he argued as
 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.069
believing in friction aside he argued as
follows okay suppose you take the

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079
follows okay suppose you take the
 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:38.330
follows okay suppose you take the
premise that you're going to show it's

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340
premise that you're going to show it's
 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.910
premise that you're going to show it's
false suppose and heavier things do fall

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920
false suppose and heavier things do fall
 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.840
false suppose and heavier things do fall
faster than light things now take a

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850
faster than light things now take a
 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.810
faster than light things now take a
stone a which is heavier than another

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820
stone a which is heavier than another
 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.969
stone a which is heavier than another
stone B that means if we tied B to a

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979
stone B that means if we tied B to a
 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:57.620
stone B that means if we tied B to a
with a string B should act as a drag on

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630
with a string B should act as a drag on
 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.289
with a string B should act as a drag on
a when we drop it because a will fall

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299
a when we drop it because a will fall
 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:04.700
a when we drop it because a will fall
faster B will fall slower and so a tied

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710
faster B will fall slower and so a tied
 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.550
faster B will fall slower and so a tied
to B should fall slower than a by itself

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560
to B should fall slower than a by itself
 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.940
to B should fall slower than a by itself
but a be tied together is heavier than a

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950
but a be tied together is heavier than a
 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.690
but a be tied together is heavier than a
by itself so it should fall faster

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700
by itself so it should fall faster
 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.059
by itself so it should fall faster
should fall both faster and slower than

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:16.069
should fall both faster and slower than
 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:19.270
should fall both faster and slower than
a by itself that's a manifest

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280
a by itself that's a manifest
 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.030
a by itself that's a manifest
contradiction so we know that our

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040
contradiction so we know that our
 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.610
contradiction so we know that our
premise was which we become began has to

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620
premise was which we become began has to
 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.070
premise was which we become began has to
be false that's a classic reductio ad

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080
be false that's a classic reductio ad
 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.710
be false that's a classic reductio ad
absurdum that's been known and named for

absurdum that's been known and named for
 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:33.520
absurdum that's been known and named for
several millennia I guess and as I say

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530
several millennia I guess and as I say
 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:35.110
