00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:03.630
Let's play the angle game.

00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:07.170
So I've drawn this crazy figure
here and I'm going to give you

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:09.590
a couple of angles and then I
want you to figure

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:10.950
out another angle.

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.350
So let me give you some angles.

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:24.970
So let's say that this angle
up here is 56 degrees.

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:37.580
Then I also tell you this
angle here is 115 degrees.

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:45.980
What I would like you to figure
out -- this is the object of

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:50.040
the angle game -- I want you to
figure out what this

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:51.960
angle is right here.

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:59.050
If you are brave, you can
pause the video and try to

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:00.520
figure it out yourself.

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.815
If you would like me to walk
you through it -- and maybe I

00:01:02.815 --> 00:01:04.520
can give you a couple of steps
and then you pause it and you

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:05.970
get the rest of it by yourself.

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.410
But I will now show you
how I would have solved

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:10.810
this in the angle game.

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:14.370
You have all the tools
necessary to already solve it.

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:16.420
I want you to be able to get
good at this, because this is

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:19.800
kind of like the key
skill on the SAT.

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.080
Oh, I didn't give you a key
piece of -- you're probably

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.560
saying I can't solve this.

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:25.250
You probably can't because
I haven't given you a key

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:26.760
piece of information.

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:29.510
This line here and this line
here, so this line and this

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:32.130
line, they're parallel.

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.330
I was telling you to solve
it before giving you a

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:35.290
key piece of information.

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:37.120
That means that
they are parallel.

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:38.740
So what can we do this figure?

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:41.500
So whenever I see these type of
problems, either while playing

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:46.890
the angle game or on, say, an
SAT, I just literally kind of

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.320
figure out every angle that I
can figure out and slowly try

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:53.570
to make my way to
the goal angle.

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:54.950
Let's see what we can
figure out here.

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.080
So I'm going to do it in this
blue-green color anything

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.070
that I can figure out.

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:04.260
So this angle is 56
degrees, right?

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.700
These lines are parallel.

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:08.535
This line here looks
like a transversal.

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.670
Well, let's see, what's a
corresponding angle to

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.420
this angle right here?

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.830
Well, it's the angle, right?

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:21.230
What do we know about
corresponding angles for

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.000
parallel lines when you
have a transversal.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:30.110
Well, that's 56 degrees because
corresponding angles are equal.

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:31.320
We could have done a
lot of other stuff.

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.730
We could have figured out that
this angle is 56 degrees, but

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:37.430
that probably wouldn't have
gotten us closer to our goal.

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:40.150
That angle's 56 degrees and
its corresponding angle

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:41.580
is also 56 degrees.

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:43.460
That wouldn't have gotten
us any closer to our goal.

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:46.910
We could have figured out that
this is 180 minus 56, right,

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:49.710
which is, what, 124 degrees.

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:51.270
That really wouldn't
have helped us much.

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:53.540
I'm showing you, these are all
things that you can do while

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:54.870
playing the angle game.

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.380
But anyway, the first step
-- I said well, these are

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:00.810
corresponding angles,
so that's 56 degrees.

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:04.160
So let's see, I need to figure
out this angle right here.

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:07.720
I know this one, and they're
in a triangle, right?

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.120
You see this triangle.

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:10.885
If only I knew this angle.

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:16.910
Can you figure out this angle?

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:22.410
Well, it is supplementary to
this 115 degrees, right?

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:26.000
So this green angle plus this
purple angle is equal to 180.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.240
So this is 180 minus 115.

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.870
So what's that?

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:32.355
180 minus -- so this
is 65 degrees.

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.940
So what have we done so far?

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:38.060
We just said well these
are parallel lines, so

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:40.010
corresponding angles are equal.

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:43.900
So this 56 degrees is
equal to this 56 degrees.

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:47.240
Then we said, well, this green
angle and this purple angle are

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:49.110
supplementary, so they
have to add up to 180.

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:51.010
So this is 115.

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:55.870
But this is 65, which
is just 180 minus 115.

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:57.690
I think you might see
where I'm going now.

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:02.640
Now we know two angles
of a triangle.

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:05.440
If we know two angles of a
triangle, what can figure

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:05.960
out about the third?

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:09.870
Well, we know the angles of a
triangle add up to 180, right?

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:13.210
So let's called this x.

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:23.350
We know that x plus 56
plus 65 equals 180.

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:25.210
What's 56 plus 65?

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:27.635
This is where I always
mess up, on the addition

00:04:27.635 --> 00:04:28.820
and the subtraction.

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:32.340
So, 5 plus 6 is 110.

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:33.990
This is 121 I believe.

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:40.900
121 equals 180.

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:43.160
Then x is equal to --
let's see, 180 minus

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:46.040
20 is 60, so it's 59.

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:48.570
x is equal to 59 degrees.

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:53.590
There we go.

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:59.430
We have accomplished our first
goal in the angle game.

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:00.090
There you saw it.

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:03.005
So let's do a tougher
angle problem.

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:09.580
This one maybe won't
involve parallel lines.

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:11.400
But I just want to show you,
everything really just boils

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:15.280
down to everything we learned
about parallel lines and

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:18.340
triangles and angles
adding up to each other.

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:20.180
So this one involves a star.

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:28.600
So, a line from there to there,
draw a line from there to

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:33.650
there, draw a line from there
to there, draw a line

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:36.240
from there to there.

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:39.840
Draw a line from
there to there.

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:41.510
What do we know about this?

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:44.400
We know that this angle
is 75 -- oh boy, I'm

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:45.410
using the wrong tool.

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:48.750
This angle is 75 degrees.

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:54.280
We also know that this
angle is 75 degrees.

00:05:54.280 --> 00:06:00.300
We know this angle
here is 101 degrees.

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:06.640
Your mission in this angle
game is to figure out

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:08.920
this angle right here.

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:10.910
What is this angle?

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:13.030
This is a good time to
pause because I will now

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:14.550
show you the solution.

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:15.560
So what can we do here?

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:19.230
So this angle, well jeez, I
just like to just mess around

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:20.690
and see what I can figure out.

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:23.800
So, if this angle here is
101 degrees, what other

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:24.880
angles can we figure out?

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:27.550
We could figure out -- well, we
could figure out this angle.

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:28.540
We could figure out
a bunch of angles.

00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:31.640
We could figure out that -- let
me switch the color, these

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:33.720
are my figure out angles.

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:37.010
So that's 101, then this
is supplementary, that's

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:39.110
79 degrees, right?

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:44.190
That's also 79 degrees because
this is also supplementary.

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:46.100
This angle right here is
opposite to it, so this

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:48.010
angle right here is
going to be 101 degrees.

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:54.340
What else can figure out?

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:56.510
We could figure out this angle
because it's supplementary, we

00:06:56.510 --> 00:06:57.910
could figure out this angle.

00:06:57.910 --> 00:06:59.700
We could also figure out this
angle because we see this

00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:01.380
triangle right here.

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:07.860
This angle plus 75 plus 75 is
going to equal 180, right?

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:12.180
So let's call this
angle b, b for blue.

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:19.910
So b plus 75 plus 75 is
going to equal 180.

00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:25.050
And I'm just using this
triangle right here.

00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:33.200
So b plus 150 is equal to 180,
or b is equal to 30 degrees.

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:35.960
So we're able to
figure this out.

00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:39.120
Now, what will you do if I told
you that we are now ready to

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:41.280
figure out this yellow angle?

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:42.260
It might not be obvious to you.

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:43.965
You kind of have to look at the
triangle in the right way, and

00:07:43.965 --> 00:07:46.850
the SAT will do this to you
all the time, all the time.

00:07:46.850 --> 00:07:49.170
That's why I'm testing
you this way.

00:07:49.170 --> 00:07:51.740
Well, let me give
you a little hint.

00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:52.555
Look at this triangle.

00:07:56.290 --> 00:08:00.360
Non-ideal color, let me do it
in red so it really stands out.

00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:02.590
Look at this triangle.

00:08:02.590 --> 00:08:04.290
I'll tell you, the hardest
thing about these problems is

00:08:04.290 --> 00:08:07.140
just looking at the right
triangle and kind of seeing

00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:11.260
that oh wow, I actually
can figure out something.

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:14.800
Look at this triangle
right here.

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:17.380
We know this angle
of it, 101 degrees.

00:08:17.380 --> 00:08:19.040
We know this angle, we
just figured it out,

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:20.970
it was 30 degrees.

00:08:20.970 --> 00:08:23.210
So all we have left is to
figure out this yellow

00:08:23.210 --> 00:08:24.405
angle, call it x.

00:08:28.230 --> 00:08:35.740
So x plus 101 plus 30 is
equal to 180 degrees because

00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:38.430
the angles in a triangle
add up to 180 degrees.

00:08:38.430 --> 00:08:43.222
So x plus 131 is equal to 180.

00:08:43.222 --> 00:08:45.300
x is equal to what?

00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:47.580
49 degrees.

00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:49.190
There you go.

00:08:49.190 --> 00:08:53.520
We've done the second
problem in the angle game.

00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:56.230
I think that's all of the time
I have now in this video.

00:08:56.230 --> 00:08:58.100
In the next video maybe I'll
do a couple more of these

00:08:58.100 --> 00:08:59.600
angle game problems.

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:01.030
See you soon.
