00:00:00.611 --> 00:00:03.251
- So this, this picture right over here,

00:00:03.251 --> 00:00:04.811
we've taken this square,

00:00:04.811 --> 00:00:09.411
we've divided it into 100
equal, smaller squares,

00:00:09.411 --> 00:00:10.432
and then we've colored in,

00:00:10.432 --> 00:00:11.711
let's see how many we've colored in.

00:00:11.711 --> 00:00:13.891
Each of these rows has
10 squares, so this is,

00:00:13.891 --> 00:00:17.251
10, 20, 30, 40,

00:00:17.251 --> 00:00:20.311
41, 42, 43, 44, 45,

00:00:20.311 --> 00:00:22.091
46, 47.

00:00:22.091 --> 00:00:23.652
So over here, we have colored in

00:00:23.652 --> 00:00:27.851
47 out of 100 equal, smaller squares.

00:00:27.851 --> 00:00:29.302
Or you could say that this,

00:00:29.302 --> 00:00:32.044
what's shaded in in blue
and green right over here,

00:00:32.044 --> 00:00:35.324
this represents 47 hundredths.

00:00:35.324 --> 00:00:38.515
This is represents 47
hundredths of the entire,

00:00:38.515 --> 00:00:40.588
of the entire whole.

00:00:40.588 --> 00:00:42.708
Now what I'm curious about is,

00:00:42.708 --> 00:00:44.588
I wanna break up this fraction.

00:00:44.588 --> 00:00:48.748
I wanna write it as 40 over,

00:00:48.748 --> 00:00:49.688
actually lemme write it this way.

00:00:49.688 --> 00:00:53.050
I wanna write it as four over 10,

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:54.810
plus,

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:57.630
plus something over 100.

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:59.030
And I'll just write star.

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:01.571
Plus star over 100.

00:01:01.571 --> 00:01:03.130
And my question to you is,

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:06.490
what is the star going to be equal to?

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:07.990
The star is equal to what?

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:10.801
And pause the video to
try to figure it out.

00:01:10.801 --> 00:01:14.550
Alright, so let's, let's
work this together.

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:17.090
So one thing that we
could say immediately,

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:19.030
is we could say that

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:22.870
47 over 100

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:25.280
is equal to 40 hundredths,

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.198
40 hundredths.

00:01:27.198 --> 00:01:30.798
You see that over here,
10, 20, 30, 40 hundredths.

00:01:30.798 --> 00:01:33.718
This is 10, 20,

00:01:33.718 --> 00:01:36.738
30, 40 hundredths,

00:01:36.738 --> 00:01:38.298
plus,

00:01:38.298 --> 00:01:42.678
one, two, three, four,
five, six, seven hundredths.

00:01:42.678 --> 00:01:46.088
Plus seven hundredths.

00:01:46.958 --> 00:01:49.019
Now, 40 hundredths is the

00:01:49.019 --> 00:01:51.949
same thing as four tenths.

00:01:51.949 --> 00:01:55.364
40 hundredths is the same
thing as four tenths.

00:01:55.364 --> 00:01:57.264
There's a bunch of ways
we could think about it.

00:01:57.264 --> 00:01:58.964
One is, you could think about dividing

00:01:58.964 --> 00:02:01.524
this larger, larger square into tenths,

00:02:01.524 --> 00:02:04.064
so this would be a tenth right over here,

00:02:04.064 --> 00:02:05.544
that would be a tenth,

00:02:05.544 --> 00:02:07.004
this would be another tenth,

00:02:07.004 --> 00:02:08.664
that's two tenths.

00:02:08.664 --> 00:02:11.584
This would be three tenths.

00:02:11.584 --> 00:02:12.684
And all I'm doing here, is I'm dividing

00:02:12.684 --> 00:02:15.124
the larger thing into tents,

00:02:15.124 --> 00:02:16.415
into tenths, I should say.

00:02:16.415 --> 00:02:17.975
If I'm taking the larger,

00:02:17.975 --> 00:02:19.375
if I'm taking the larger square,

00:02:19.375 --> 00:02:21.015
instead of dividing it into hundredths,

00:02:21.015 --> 00:02:22.715
I divide it into tenths.

00:02:22.715 --> 00:02:25.295
So this would be four tenths,

00:02:25.295 --> 00:02:26.816
(mumbles) doing five tenths,

00:02:27.746 --> 00:02:29.056
six tenths,

00:02:29.946 --> 00:02:31.286
six tenths,

00:02:31.286 --> 00:02:33.646
seven tenths,

00:02:33.646 --> 00:02:35.606
eight tenths,

00:02:35.606 --> 00:02:36.986
and nine tenths,

00:02:36.986 --> 00:02:38.346
and then 10 tenths.

00:02:38.346 --> 00:02:40.146
Notice, if you look at the orange lines,

00:02:40.146 --> 00:02:42.646
I've divided my square not
into a hundred equal sections,

00:02:42.646 --> 00:02:44.546
but into ten equal sections.

00:02:44.546 --> 00:02:46.486
And so you see, these 40 hundredths

00:02:46.486 --> 00:02:48.126
that are in blue right over there,

00:02:48.126 --> 00:02:50.496
that's the same thing as one tenth,

00:02:51.646 --> 00:02:52.879
two tenths,

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:55.452
three tenths,

00:02:56.682 --> 00:02:58.943
and four tenths.

00:02:58.943 --> 00:03:02.614
So that is the four
tenths, right over there.

00:03:02.614 --> 00:03:04.285
Another way you could think about it,

00:03:04.285 --> 00:03:05.826
when you go from hundredths to tenths,

00:03:05.826 --> 00:03:09.066
each 10 hundredths, each 10 hundredths,

00:03:09.066 --> 00:03:11.697
is are equal to one tenth.

00:03:11.697 --> 00:03:15.217
So you're dividing both
the denominator by 10,

00:03:15.217 --> 00:03:16.877
when you go from hundredths to tenths.

00:03:16.877 --> 00:03:19.697
And you'd also divide the numerator by 10,

00:03:19.697 --> 00:03:22.397
going from hundredths to tenths.

00:03:22.397 --> 00:03:24.657
So 40 divided by 10 is four,

00:03:24.657 --> 00:03:26.937
100 divided by 10 is 10.

00:03:26.937 --> 00:03:27.917
So hopefully you're convinced that

00:03:27.917 --> 00:03:30.357
40 hundredths is the same
thing as four tenths.

00:03:30.357 --> 00:03:31.797
But what's left over?

00:03:31.797 --> 00:03:34.897
Well, we still have the
seven hundredths over here.

00:03:34.897 --> 00:03:37.178
So 40 hundredths plus seven hundredths

00:03:37.178 --> 00:03:41.877
is the same thing as four
tenths, plus seven hundredths.

00:03:41.877 --> 00:03:43.639
So the star right over here,

00:03:43.639 --> 00:03:45.759
this is going to, let me actually,

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:47.051
let me erase this.

00:03:47.051 --> 00:03:48.571
The star right over here,

00:03:48.571 --> 00:03:52.011
I could write that as seven hundredths.

00:03:52.011 --> 00:03:53.311
So you see, 47 hundredths,

00:03:53.311 --> 00:03:54.532
which is all the stuff shaded,

00:03:54.532 --> 00:03:56.552
that's the same thing as the four tenths.

00:03:56.552 --> 00:03:58.392
Which is the same thing as 40 hundredths,

00:03:58.392 --> 00:03:59.652
shaded in blue.

00:03:59.652 --> 00:04:01.632
Plus these one, two, three, four,

00:04:01.632 --> 00:04:04.752
five, six, seven
hundredths, right over here.

00:04:04.752 --> 00:04:06.952
47 on 100, or 47 hundredths,

00:04:06.952 --> 00:04:09.412
4 tenths, plus seven hundredths.
