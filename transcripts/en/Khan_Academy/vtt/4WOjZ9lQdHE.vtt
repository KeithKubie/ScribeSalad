00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:04.270
We're on problem 201 which I
had continued in the last

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:07.020
video, but, frankly, I had bad
reading comprehension.

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.770
I had read the first statement
wrong, and I went down an

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:11.050
incorrect path.

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:12.230
So let me read it correctly.

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:15.700
If the sum of n consecutive
integers is 0, which of the

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:16.730
following must be true?

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:18.730
So I have n numbers in
the row, and their

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:20.760
sum has to be 0.

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.470
So, first of all, that tells us
that some of them have to

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.990
be positive and some of them
have to be negative.

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.710
And they're consecutive,
right?

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:30.430
So if we put this as 0-- let's
think about how we can even

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:33.090
construct this, how this
could ever happen.

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.705
n consecutive numbers,
the sum being 0.

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.730
Really in, order to do that--
and they're consecutive, which

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.280
is a trick.

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:55.770
If a is one of the numbers,
then, really, negative a has

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.390
to be one of the numbers
as well.

00:00:58.390 --> 00:00:59.190
And why is that?

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.270
You might say, oh well why can't
I have some other set of

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.370
negative numbers
that offset a?

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:07.080
Well, the key here is
that we're dealing

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.030
with consecutive numbers.

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:09.910
Because those other negative
numbers are going to have to

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:12.760
offset all of the other positive
numbers in between.

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:15.920
Maybe I should do this
with more abstract.

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.550
Let's say that n
is equal to 1.

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:22.720
The sum of n consecutive
integers is 0.

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:24.760
So, first of all,
can n equal 0?

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:25.880
Well sure.

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.760
Only if that one integer is 0.

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:31.910
Now what if n is equal to 2?

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:33.580
Can n equal 2?

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:35.200
Well let's think about it.

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.160
We have to add one integer
to this, and

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.000
they're integers right?

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.030
So if we add one integer-- if
we add any positive integer

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:49.140
here, a, then the sum is
going to be 0 plus a.

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.544
If you're going to cross the
negative boundary, if you're

00:01:52.544 --> 00:01:56.700
going to cross 0, 0 has to
be one of your integers.

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.270
So that's always going
to be counted.

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:01.050
So, in order to get into
negative a, you need to have

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:04.360
at least three integers.

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:08.630
So, if I said that n is equal
to 3, you could do 1,

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:11.500
0, and minus 1.

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.060
Now, if n is equal to 4, can
I just add one number?

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:16.320
Can I add either 2
or negative 2?

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.960
No, that'll change
the sum again.

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:24.050
So I have to add a
2 and a minus 2.

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:26.250
So I think you could see here
that there's a pattern because

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.130
0 is always going to be one
of the integers and it's

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:30.860
symmetric on the right-
or left-hand side.

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:35.470
We're always going to have an
odd number of integers we're

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:36.040
summing up.

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.800
So we know that n is odd.

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:43.310
So, we know statement one.

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:45.480
They say statement
one, n even.

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:46.230
That's not true.

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.830
We actually can't construct
it with n as even.

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:53.660
Statement two says, n is odd
which we've just shown.

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:57.020
And then statement three
is, the average of the

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:59.380
n integers is 0.

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:00.840
Well sure.

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.430
What's the average?

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:08.750
It's the sum of the integers
divided by n.

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:12.340
Well, they're telling us that
the sum of the integers is 0.

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:14.490
So 0 divided by anything, as
long as we don't have zero

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:17.280
integers, is 0.

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.150
So two and three are
both correct.

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.250
So the choice is e.

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:25.500
Next question.

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:38.390
202.

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:46.690
In the formula, v is equal
to 1 over 2r cubed.

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:51.800
If r is halved, then v is
multiplied by what?

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:53.400
The easiest thing I always
find to do in

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.100
this is take numbers.

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:57.490
So let's say, if r is
2 what happens?

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:59.600
And let's halve it when
r equals 1 and see

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:00.550
what happens to v.

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:03.350
We can do it analytically, but
this is, frankly, the easiest

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:04.400
way to do it.

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:07.510
So you can say when r is equal
to 2, v is equal to 1 over 2

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:11.870
times 2, is 4, to the
third power is 64.

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:16.740
And then when r is 1, you get 1
over-- let's see, 2 times 1

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:18.130
is 2 to the third power.

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:20.209
So you get 1/8.

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:22.180
So what happened to v?

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:26.830
We, essentially, multiplied
that by 8.

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:30.260
So that is choice b.

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:33.760
To go from 1/64 to 1/8 you
have to multiply by 8.

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:37.070
You can view 1/8 as the same
thing as 8/64 if that

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:38.380
clarifies it at all.

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:40.700
I always find it easier to
deal with actual physical

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:43.050
numbers where they say, if you
change this variable by a

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:46.190
factor of 5 what happened
to that variable?

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:47.830
So easy to just-- well anyway.

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:51.060
It could get very confusing if
you try to do an r1 and an r2,

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:54.800
and r1 is 2 times
r2 and all that.

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:57.350
Next question.

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:01.840
203.

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:05.040
A certain bakery has
six employees.

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:08.220
It pays annual salaries
of $14,000

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:09.785
to each of two employees.

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:17.300
$16,000 to one employee.

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:20.050
And $17,000 to each of the
remaining three employees.

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:28.240
The average annual salary of
these employees is closest to

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:29.620
which of the following?

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:31.730
So, we have to take the sum
of all their salaries

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:33.460
and divide by 6.

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:39.490
So it'll be 2 times 14, plus 1
times 16-- which is 16, plus 3

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:44.090
times 17, and we
divide it by 6.

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:51.290
2 times 14 is 28, plus 16, plus
51, all of that over 6.

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:52.450
Let's see, what is
that equal to?

00:05:52.450 --> 00:06:02.790
28, 16, 51, 8 plus 6 is 14, 14
plus 1 is 15, 1 plus 2 is 3, 3

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:08.070
plus 1 is 4, 4 plus 5 is 9.

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:09.360
This was 8 plus 6.

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:12.410
So, it's 95 divided by 6.

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:15.090
Sorry, 95 divided by 6.

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:17.850
I think my brain was computing
ahead of me because 96 divided

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:23.710
by 6 is equal to 16.

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:26.230
So this number is going
to be just under 16.

00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:28.790
It's 15 and 5/6.

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:32.210
So they want to get an
approximate, as close as-- oh,

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:34.210
actually they have a lot of
numbers that are really close.

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:39.490
Let me make sure that
I get it right.

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:42.650
So, 6 goes into 95-- if they
didn't have numbers that

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:44.070
weren't close, I wouldn't
do this.

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:46.830
6 goes into 95, 6 into 9, 6.

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:52.570
35, goes 5 times, 5 times
6 is 30, remainder of 5.

00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:55.600
Actually let's keep going
because we want a decimal.

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:58.530
We're doing it in thousands
So, bring down a 0.

00:06:58.530 --> 00:07:02.670
6 goes into 50 8 times.

00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:04.150
8 times 6 is 48.

00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:07.140
Remember, we were dealing in
thousands when I said 16, that

00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:07.730
was thousands.

00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:10.840
So, now we're at
15.8 thousand.

00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:16.190
So 8 times 48, 20, 6 goes
into 20 3 times.

00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:18.420
I think that's close enough
to what we need.

00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:21.750
So it's going to be
roughly $15,800.

00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:23.920
Or 15.8 thousands.

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:27.850
And that is choice C.

00:07:27.850 --> 00:07:29.650
At first I said maybe we can
approximate, and they had

00:07:29.650 --> 00:07:33.510
16,000 there, but then I saw the
15,800 so we should do a

00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:34.300
little bit more math.

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:37.230
We don't want to get
too careless.

00:07:37.230 --> 00:07:39.010
Next problem.

00:07:39.010 --> 00:07:42.810
204.

00:07:42.810 --> 00:07:48.260
If x is equal to the sum of the
even integers from 40 to

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:58.480
60 inclusive.

00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:00.990
This is my ad hoc notation.

00:08:00.990 --> 00:08:03.510
And y is the number
of even integers.

00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:11.900
Let's see, if x is equal to the
sum of the even integers

00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:18.750
from 40 to 60, inclusive, so it
includes 40 and 60, and y

00:08:18.750 --> 00:08:22.640
is the number of even integers
from 40 to 60 inclusive, what

00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:25.915
is the value of x plus y?

00:08:30.060 --> 00:08:32.120
The number-- y is
an easy thing.

00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:34.890
How many integers are there
between 40 and 60, if you

00:08:34.890 --> 00:08:37.520
include both of them?

00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:39.580
This is always a tricky
thing to think about.

00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:44.260
But, if you think about it, if
I said the numbers 1, 2, and

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:46.740
3, how many integers
are there here?

00:08:46.740 --> 00:08:47.860
Well, clearly, you
can count them.

00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:49.270
1, 2, and 3.

00:08:49.270 --> 00:08:53.150
But if you wanted a quick way
you could say 3 minus-- if I

00:08:53.150 --> 00:08:58.360
just took the endpoint minus
the starting point, I would

00:08:58.360 --> 00:08:59.960
get these integers.

00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:02.300
Then I want to add 1.

00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:05.150
If I want to know how integers
are there between 60 and 40, I

00:09:05.150 --> 00:09:07.960
would say 60 minus 40.

00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:11.180
And that'll give me 41,
42, 43, 44, all the

00:09:11.180 --> 00:09:12.840
way to 59, and 60.

00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:14.210
And then I have to add
1 because we're

00:09:14.210 --> 00:09:15.920
including 40 as well.

00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:20.870
So y is equal to 21.

00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:26.490
Now let's think about, is there
an easy way to add up

00:09:26.490 --> 00:09:30.200
all of the integers between
40 and-- all of the

00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:32.360
even, oh no, no sorry.

00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:36.600
y is the number of even integers
from 40 to 60.

00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:38.430
So that's not right.

00:09:38.430 --> 00:09:39.700
So, even integers.

00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:41.920
Frankly, it might just
be easier to-- let's

00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:43.110
just write them out.

00:09:43.110 --> 00:09:56.740
40, 42, 44, 46, 48, 50, 52,
54, 56, 58, and 60.

00:09:56.740 --> 00:10:02.460
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,
7, 8, 9, 10, 11.

00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:03.760
11 intergers.

00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:05.300
So that's y.

00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:09.140
And we need to take the
sum of all of these.

00:10:09.140 --> 00:10:11.390
So there's a couple of ways
we could think about it.

00:10:11.390 --> 00:10:18.170
You could view this as 40
plus 0, 40 plus 2, 40

00:10:18.170 --> 00:10:20.620
plus 3, and so forth.

00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:23.540
All the way to 40 plus 8.

00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:27.580
And so if you wanted to add up
at least up to this point,

00:10:27.580 --> 00:10:29.650
it's a pretty straightforward
way of doing it.

00:10:29.650 --> 00:10:34.300
You could just say, there's
1, 2, 3, 4, 5 of them.

00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:38.140
So it's equal to 40 times 5.

00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:39.460
That adds up all the 40's.

00:10:39.460 --> 00:10:42.330
Plus 2, plus 4, plus
6, plus 8.

00:10:42.330 --> 00:10:47.540
So 2 plus 4 is 6, plus 6
is 12, plus 8 is 20.

00:10:47.540 --> 00:10:48.880
So, plus 20.

00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:52.290
So, that's 40 times 5 is what?

00:10:52.290 --> 00:10:55.663
200 plus 20 is equal to 220.

00:10:55.663 --> 00:10:58.020
And you use the same
logic here.

00:10:58.020 --> 00:11:06.070
This is 50 plus 0, 50 plus 2,
all the way to 50 plus 10.

00:11:06.070 --> 00:11:07.010
And how many are there?

00:11:07.010 --> 00:11:10.590
There's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

00:11:10.590 --> 00:11:21.170
So, it's equal to 6 times 50,
plus 2 plus 4 is 6, plus 6 is

00:11:21.170 --> 00:11:24.970
12, plus 8 is 20.

00:11:24.970 --> 00:11:25.960
Which we actually
already knew.

00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:26.880
We already calculated it there.

00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:28.050
It was 20.

00:11:28.050 --> 00:11:32.130
Because these don't contribute
to the-- oh no, no plus 10.

00:11:32.130 --> 00:11:33.120
Sorry, plus 10.

00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:34.010
Don't want to get careless.

00:11:34.010 --> 00:11:36.070
Plus 10.

00:11:36.070 --> 00:11:38.300
Because there's six of these.

00:11:38.300 --> 00:11:42.310
There's plus 0, plus 2, plus
4, plus 6, plus 8, plus 10.

00:11:42.310 --> 00:11:44.940
So, it's 20 plus 10 is 30.

00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:48.510
2 plus 4 plus 6 plus
8 plus 10 is 30.

00:11:48.510 --> 00:11:54.710
So, 6 times 6 is 300, plus
30 is equal to 330.

00:11:54.710 --> 00:11:57.320
So, 330 plus 220.

00:11:57.320 --> 00:12:00.970
These numbers have a strange
pattern that-- well there is a

00:12:00.970 --> 00:12:04.470
formula if you want to add the
first n numbers, but they've

00:12:04.470 --> 00:12:06.510
changed it a little bit by
talking about even numbers so

00:12:06.510 --> 00:12:08.820
I wanted to do it manually.

00:12:08.820 --> 00:12:11.750
So you go 0, 5, 5.

00:12:11.750 --> 00:12:15.670
So 550 is the sum.

00:12:15.670 --> 00:12:18.030
And then we know that
y-- this is x.

00:12:18.030 --> 00:12:19.280
x is equal to 550.

00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:20.640
And y is equal to 11.

00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:22.300
We figured that out before.

00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:30.320
So x plus y is equal to 550,
plus 11 which is equal to 561,

00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:33.820
which is, thank goodness,
actually one of the choices.

00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:35.470
That's choice D.

00:12:35.470 --> 00:12:37.500
