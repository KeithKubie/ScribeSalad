00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:11.840
J.P. Morgan and His Giant, Knobbly, Purple
Nose

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:15.019
John “J.P.” Morgan is a name synonymous
with business.

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:20.190
A man who was so respected and influential
in the spheres of business and finance that

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:24.920
the appearance of the guy on the Monopoly
board, Rich Uncle Pennybags, is thought to

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:25.920
be based on him.

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:31.059
But rather than talk about how Morgan accumulated
his truly vast amount of wealth, how he was

00:00:31.059 --> 00:00:35.590
such a powerful force in the world of finance
that he once rescued the United States government

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:41.039
from bankruptcy in 1893; or that time in 1907
when he managed to stop cold the Wall Street

00:00:41.039 --> 00:00:46.841
Panic of 1907 which might have otherwise plunged
the U.S. into a Depression (and the result

00:00:46.841 --> 00:00:51.480
of which inspired the creation of the Federal
Reserve System, for when someone like J.P.

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.339
Morgan wasn’t around to fix the situation);
or that time he financed Thomas Edison in

00:00:55.339 --> 00:00:59.970
the invention of a commercially viable light
bulb and helped form General Electric; or

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:04.050
any of the other of his countless history
changing business conquests, no, we’re going

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:08.280
to talk about something much less well known
about this admiral of industry- his giant

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.280
nose.

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:13.950
Now given the list of accomplishments attributed
to Morgan and the ridiculous amount of power

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.570
he wielded during his lifetime to the point
that the President of the United States was

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:24.110
called his lapdog and nicknames in the finance
industry for the man included Zeus and Jupiter,

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:29.540
it may seem a little odd that we want to talk
about his nose; so let us explain.

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:33.600
Morgan didn’t just have a bulbous nose;
it was also purple-ish/red because of a skin

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.340
condition he suffered from as a child known
as rosacea.

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:40.090
This causes the blood vessels in the face
to dilate and rupture.

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:43.760
In addition to this, Morgan also suffered
from rhinophyma, which is a common side effect

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:48.100
of rosacea, resulting in numerous growths,
lesions and fissures also marking the surface

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:49.310
of his nose.

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:54.440
But here’s the thing, almost nobody in America
during Morgan’s lifetime was aware of any

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:58.590
of this- impressive considering he was one
of the most famous business magnates in the

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.670
world for a not insignificant portion of his
life.

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:06.609
jp-morganMorgan was largely able to avoid
having the general public know about his condition

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:11.009
by being absolutely terrifying both in private
and public.

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:15.220
Standing at an intimidating 6 ft 2 inches
tall (the average male height in the U.S.

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:23.660
at the time was 5’7″ or 170 cm, and in
Europe 5’5″ or 165 cm) with massive shoulders

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:28.800
and piercing eyes some have likened to those
a magpie, few people dared approach Morgan

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:34.250
in public and fewer still dared to do so with
a camera out of fear Morgan would quite literally

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:37.260
attempt to beat them half to death in the
street.

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.760
This may sound like hyperbole, but Morgan
was known to violently lash out at anyone

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:46.110
who attempted to take his photo without his
permission, so much so that one of the few

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:50.840
unofficial pictures we have of him actually
shows him in the middle of swinging his walking

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.920
stick at the cameraman’s face.

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:57.910
While conducting business Morgan was decidedly
less violent, but was still feared by those

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:01.780
who had to deal with him due to his infamously
short temper.

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:06.080
Morgan hated long meetings and would often
seemingly make snap judgements about business

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:10.950
deals and people, sometimes throwing the latter
out of his office mere seconds after meeting

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:11.950
them.

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:16.030
This habit earned Morgan the nickname “Yes-or-No
Morgan” amongst his peers.

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:20.470
Though many assumed this was simply a result
of Morgan’s temper, behind the scenes he

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:25.360
had his staff meticulously research anyone
who wished to meet with him and what exactly

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:29.700
they were going to be presenting him with
so that by the time they shook hands, he already

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:34.310
knew a lot about them and had made himself
an expert on whatever venture they would be

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:38.340
proposing; thus, he was really just looking
to size the individual up in person before

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.690
agreeing to some deal or tossing them out.

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:45.140
Supposedly Morgan started doing this as a
result of a shady business deal he financed

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:50.570
during the American Civil War that came to
be known as the Hall Carbine Affair, the unscrupulous

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:54.980
nature of which Morgan purportedly had been
ignorant of- he had simply lent one Simon

00:03:54.980 --> 00:04:00.080
Stevens the $20,000 (a little over half a
million dollars today) to move forward with

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:01.080
the scheme.

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:04.820
(Speaking of the Civil War, Morgan himself
never took part, instead paying a substitute

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:06.060
to take his place.

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:07.480
The cost?

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:13.590
$300, about $9,000 today, or roughly the amount
of money Morgan spent on a single order of

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:17.160
cigars, which he smoked dozens of every day.)

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:21.150
Outside of countless extramarital affairs
(his first wife, Amelia “Mimi” Sturges,

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:25.629
“the only woman he ever loved” died of
tuberculosis within four months of their marriage;

00:04:25.629 --> 00:04:30.330
his second, Frances Louisa Tracy, he wasn’t
so loyal to), Morgan was known as a man of

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:34.490
impeccable moral integrity as a result of
his deeply religious beliefs.

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:38.740
He was also famous for his hands-on approach
to business, often insisting on personally

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:44.199
meeting with anyone who wished to deal in
any significant way with any of his many business

00:04:44.199 --> 00:04:45.199
holdings.

00:04:45.199 --> 00:04:50.490
In these meetings, Morgan would use his towering
frame and reputation to squarely address prospective

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:56.020
business partners, making unflinching eye
contact the entire time- a refusal to hold

00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:00.620
his gaze was seen as weakness by Morgan and
meetings where a person failed to shake his

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:03.850
hand in a satisfactory manner rarely lasted
long.

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:08.320
morganBack to his visage, Morgan intensely
disliked having his portrait painted, due

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:13.080
to both his self-consciousness about his nose
(something he required be touched up in all

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:17.729
photographs and paintings to appear more normal)
as well as the fact that he simply didn’t

00:05:17.729 --> 00:05:19.860
like sitting still doing nothing.

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:24.550
As a result, portrait painters often used
a picture of Morgan he would intensely scrutinise

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:25.550
beforehand.

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:30.210
A notable example of this occurred in 1903
when an artist called Fedor Encke hired a

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:35.539
young photographer by the name of Edward Steichen
to take a picture of the business titan to

00:05:35.539 --> 00:05:39.189
help him complete a portrait he had been commissioned
to create.

00:05:39.189 --> 00:05:43.740
Steichen spent hours perfecting the lighting
for the resulting shoot, using a janitor with

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:48.599
a similar build to the tycoon to sit in for
Morgan who himself agreed to turn up for only

00:05:48.599 --> 00:05:50.349
a grand total of 5 minutes.

00:05:50.349 --> 00:05:54.430
The eventual shoot lasted only 3 minutes,
the efficiency of which inspired Morgan to

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:57.539
exclaim to Steichen, “I like you, young
man!”

00:05:57.539 --> 00:06:01.590
According to Steichen, Morgan turned up to
the shoot and without saying a word, sat in

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:06.039
the chair positioned in the middle of the
room and struck a dignified pose; Steichen

00:06:06.039 --> 00:06:10.880
obliged and took a photo before saying something
that would define his later career- “Would

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:12.569
you mind moving your head?”

00:06:12.569 --> 00:06:16.419
Morgan answer the question with a withering
glare that Steichen managed to quickly capture

00:06:16.419 --> 00:06:19.919
with a second photo before Morgan could change
his expression.

00:06:19.919 --> 00:06:25.849
Morgan then stood up, paid Steichen $500 (about
$13,000 today) and after a brief exchange,

00:06:25.849 --> 00:06:26.849
left.

00:06:26.849 --> 00:06:29.729
JP-Morgan-daggerKnowing Morgan’s sensitivity
about his nose, Steichen touched up the two

00:06:29.729 --> 00:06:35.349
photos as best he could to make the protuberance
look more normal, then took the photos to

00:06:35.349 --> 00:06:36.849
Morgan to show him the result.

00:06:36.849 --> 00:06:41.349
Morgan loved the first, ordering a dozen copies
and ordering that Fedor Encke use it as the

00:06:41.349 --> 00:06:43.210
basis of the aforementioned portrait.

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:49.099
The second photo, however, was much closer
to the stereotypical idea of J.P. Morgan-

00:06:49.099 --> 00:06:50.849
the ruthless robber baron.

00:06:50.849 --> 00:06:55.789
In fact, whereas the first photo showed Morgan
as a dignified businessman, the second literally

00:06:55.789 --> 00:06:58.379
made him look like he was about the stab someone.

00:06:58.379 --> 00:07:02.580
You see, beyond his stern expression, it looked
like he was holding a knife in his hand thanks

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:06.620
to a quirk of the lighting which made the
arm of the chair Morgan was holding look like

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:08.050
a small dagger.

00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:12.729
Morgan hated the photo and tore up the first
copy he saw on the spot before throwing Steichen

00:07:12.729 --> 00:07:13.879
out of his office.

00:07:13.879 --> 00:07:17.759
Perhaps in an attempt to make sure the photo
never saw the light of day, Morgan offered

00:07:17.759 --> 00:07:23.980
the photographer $5,000 ($130,000 today) for
the original print, which he never sold, as

00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:27.720
a way of annoying the banking behemoth for
being so rude to him.

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:31.919
When Morgan eventually requested copies of
that second photo, Steichen agreed to send

00:07:31.919 --> 00:07:35.110
them over, but delayed doing so for three
full years.

00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:39.479
As he said, this was “my rather childish
way of getting even with [him] for tearing

00:07:39.479 --> 00:07:41.160
up that first proof.”

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:45.439
In the end, Morgan died with virtually nobody
outside of his circle of friends and those

00:07:45.439 --> 00:07:49.990
he did face-to-face business with knowing
how he truly looked, and it took years for

00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:55.319
actual, untouched photos of the man to surface
publicly- so tightly had he controlled his

00:07:55.319 --> 00:07:56.319
image.

00:07:56.319 --> 00:08:00.449
Beyond controlling how people saw him visually,
unfortunately for those of us who love history,

00:08:00.449 --> 00:08:05.939
Morgan’s love of privacy also inspired him
to, shortly before his death, burn thousands

00:08:05.939 --> 00:08:10.860
of letters he wrote, including just over 30
years worth of weekly letters to his father

00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:15.379
in England concerning the state of business
and politics in the United States starting

00:08:15.379 --> 00:08:20.409
in the 1850s- letters which otherwise would
have been a veritable treasure-trove of firsthand

00:08:20.409 --> 00:08:25.289
accounts and insights on business and politics
in the United States from one of the greatest

00:08:25.289 --> 00:09:13.850
businessmen 

00:09:13.850 --> 00:10:14.810
in history.
