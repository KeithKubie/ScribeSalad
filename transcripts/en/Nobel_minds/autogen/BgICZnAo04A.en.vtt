about the future now it's not gonna go
quite<00:01:19.759><c> that</c><00:01:19.970><c> way</c><00:01:20.149><c> and</c><00:01:20.300><c> we</c><00:01:20.450><c> will</c><00:01:20.570><c> intermingle</c>

quite that way and we will intermingle
the<00:01:21.320><c> times</c><00:01:21.590><c> so</c><00:01:22.130><c> don't</c><00:01:22.310><c> forgive</c><00:01:22.670><c> us</c><00:01:22.820><c> but</c><00:01:23.270><c> that's</c>

described<00:06:10.259><c> somewhat</c><00:06:10.650><c> by</c><00:06:10.800><c> that</c><00:06:10.979><c> first</c><00:06:11.190><c> picture</c>

00:06:11.619 --> 00:06:11.629 align:start position:0%
described somewhat by that first picture
 

00:06:11.629 --> 00:06:15.740 align:start position:0%
described somewhat by that first picture
but<00:06:12.629><c> then</c><00:06:13.050><c> in</c><00:06:13.440><c> 1916</c><00:06:14.400><c> he</c><00:06:14.520><c> wrote</c><00:06:14.699><c> a</c><00:06:14.729><c> paper</c><00:06:14.969><c> and</c><00:06:15.659><c> I</c>

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:15.750 align:start position:0%
but then in 1916 he wrote a paper and I
 

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:17.089 align:start position:0%
but then in 1916 he wrote a paper and I
have<00:06:15.780><c> to</c><00:06:16.020><c> drink</c><00:06:16.199><c> something</c><00:06:16.469><c> just</c><00:06:16.830><c> to</c><00:06:16.919><c> bear</c>

00:06:17.089 --> 00:06:17.099 align:start position:0%
have to drink something just to bear
 

00:06:17.099 --> 00:06:25.580 align:start position:0%
have to drink something just to bear

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:25.590 align:start position:0%
with me it's not forever in that theory
 

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:29.029 align:start position:0%
with me it's not forever in that theory
yeah<00:06:26.490><c> later</c><00:06:26.880><c> on</c><00:06:27.090><c> he</c><00:06:27.270><c> had</c><00:06:27.300><c> a</c><00:06:27.449><c> paper</c><00:06:27.930><c> in</c><00:06:28.199><c> 1916</c>

00:06:29.029 --> 00:06:29.039 align:start position:0%
yeah later on he had a paper in 1916
 

00:06:29.039 --> 00:06:31.519 align:start position:0%
yeah later on he had a paper in 1916
where<00:06:29.669><c> he</c><00:06:29.789><c> describes</c><00:06:30.300><c> a</c><00:06:30.690><c> lot</c><00:06:30.930><c> of</c><00:06:31.080><c> things</c><00:06:31.319><c> that</c>

00:06:31.519 --> 00:06:31.529 align:start position:0%
where he describes a lot of things that
 

00:06:31.529 --> 00:06:34.939 align:start position:0%
where he describes a lot of things that
showed<00:06:32.219><c> that</c><00:06:32.400><c> it</c><00:06:32.520><c> had</c><00:06:32.550><c> a</c><00:06:32.639><c> Newtonian</c><00:06:33.270><c> limit</c><00:06:33.949><c> and</c>

00:06:34.939 --> 00:06:34.949 align:start position:0%
showed that it had a Newtonian limit and
 

00:06:34.949 --> 00:06:36.980 align:start position:0%
showed that it had a Newtonian limit and
he<00:06:35.580><c> also</c><00:06:35.729><c> shows</c><00:06:36.060><c> that</c><00:06:36.599><c> there</c><00:06:36.960><c> are</c>

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:36.990 align:start position:0%
he also shows that there are
 

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:39.290 align:start position:0%
he also shows that there are

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:41.370 align:start position:0%
and the only reason why I bring this up
 

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:43.459 align:start position:0%
and the only reason why I bring this up
here<00:06:42.029><c> is</c><00:06:42.060><c> because</c><00:06:42.330><c> of</c><00:06:42.630><c> a</c><00:06:42.810><c> very</c><00:06:42.840><c> interesting</c>

talk to them about them in a minute but
 

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:51.529 align:start position:0%
talk to them about them in a minute but
he<00:06:50.009><c> describes</c><00:06:50.460><c> an</c><00:06:50.699><c> equation</c><00:06:51.000><c> which</c><00:06:51.300><c> is</c><00:06:51.389><c> up</c>

he describes an equation which is up
 

00:06:51.539 --> 00:06:53.390 align:start position:0%
he describes an equation which is up

00:06:55.249 --> 00:06:55.259 align:start position:0%
it says this is the strength of gravity
 

00:06:55.259 --> 00:06:57.290 align:start position:0%
it says this is the strength of gravity

00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:36.570 align:start position:0%
so yeah and you have to be far enough
 

00:09:36.570 --> 00:09:38.750 align:start position:0%
so yeah and you have to be far enough

00:09:38.750 --> 00:09:38.760 align:start position:0%
away so you're not looking at Newtonian
 

00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:40.670 align:start position:0%

just<00:09:39.330><c> a</c><00:09:39.420><c> new</c><00:09:39.540><c> induced</c><00:09:39.960><c> field</c><00:09:40.260><c> you</c><00:09:40.380><c> have</c><00:09:40.470><c> to</c><00:09:40.560><c> go</c>

00:09:40.670 --> 00:09:40.680 align:start position:0%
just a new induced field you have to go
 

00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:41.810 align:start position:0%
just a new induced field you have to go

00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:43.070 align:start position:0%

enough<00:09:41.970><c> so</c><00:09:42.210><c> that</c><00:09:42.360><c> you're</c><00:09:42.480><c> looking</c><00:09:42.720><c> at</c><00:09:42.870><c> the</c>

00:09:43.070 --> 00:09:43.080 align:start position:0%

radiation field the field that carries
these<00:09:45.540><c> waves</c><00:09:45.840><c> so</c><00:09:46.470><c> you</c><00:09:46.560><c> have</c><00:09:46.650><c> to</c><00:09:46.800><c> go</c><00:09:46.890><c> out</c><00:09:47.010><c> a</c>

00:09:47.030 --> 00:09:47.040 align:start position:0%
these waves so you have to go out a
 

00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:49.310 align:start position:0%
these waves so you have to go out a

00:09:49.310 --> 00:09:49.320 align:start position:0%
wavelength about that's 300 kilometers
 

00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:52.010 align:start position:0%

00:09:58.040 --> 00:09:58.050 align:start position:0%
can't even do that now and that's why
 

00:09:58.050 --> 00:10:00.830 align:start position:0%
can't even do that now and that's why
