00:00:06.682 --> 00:00:09.811
Is she turning towards you
or away from you?

00:00:09.811 --> 00:00:11.536
No one can agree.

00:00:11.536 --> 00:00:14.961
She's the mysterious subject
of Dutch master Johannes Vermeer's

00:00:14.961 --> 00:00:17.191
"Girl with the Pearl Earring,"

00:00:17.191 --> 00:00:22.119
a painting often referred to
as the 'Mona Lisa of the North.'

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:27.121
Belonging to a Dutch style of idealized, 
sometimes overly expressive paintings

00:00:27.121 --> 00:00:28.561
known as tronies,

00:00:28.561 --> 00:00:31.011
the "Girl with the Pearl Earring"
has the allure

00:00:31.011 --> 00:00:34.542
and subtlety characteristic 
of Vermeer's work.

00:00:34.542 --> 00:00:37.811
But this painting stands apart from
the quiet narrative scenes

00:00:37.811 --> 00:00:42.002
that we observe from afar in many
of Vermeer's paintings.

00:00:42.002 --> 00:00:43.431
A girl reading a letter.

00:00:43.431 --> 00:00:44.672
A piano lesson.

00:00:44.672 --> 00:00:46.641
A portrait artist at work.

00:00:46.641 --> 00:00:51.071
These paintings give us a sense of
intimacy while retaining their distance,

00:00:51.071 --> 00:00:54.643
a drawn curtain often emphasizes
the separation.

00:00:54.643 --> 00:00:58.123
We can witness a milkmaid
serenely pouring a bowl of milk,

00:00:58.123 --> 00:01:00.221
but that milk isn't for us.

00:01:00.221 --> 00:01:02.132
We're only onlookers.

00:01:02.132 --> 00:01:04.571
The studied composition
in Vermeer's paintings

00:01:04.571 --> 00:01:07.492
invokes a balanced harmony.

00:01:07.492 --> 00:01:10.003
With the checkered floor in many
of his works,

00:01:10.003 --> 00:01:14.462
Vermeer demonstrates his command
of perspective and foreshortening.

00:01:14.462 --> 00:01:16.443
That's a technique that uses distortion

00:01:16.443 --> 00:01:20.763
to give the illusion
of an object receding into the distance.

00:01:20.763 --> 00:01:24.213
Other elements, like sight lines,
mirrors, and light sources

00:01:24.213 --> 00:01:27.513
describe the moment through space
and position.

00:01:27.513 --> 00:01:29.963
The woman reading 
a letter by an open window

00:01:29.963 --> 00:01:35.312
is precisely placed so the window
can reflect her image back to the viewer.

00:01:35.312 --> 00:01:40.064
Vermeer would even hide the leg
of an easel for the sake of composition.

00:01:40.064 --> 00:01:45.212
The absence of these very elements brings
the "Girl with the Pearl Earring" to life.

00:01:45.212 --> 00:01:48.673
Vermeer's treatment of light and shadow,
or chiaroscuro,

00:01:48.673 --> 00:01:54.755
uses a dark, flat background to further
spotlight her three-dimensionality.

00:01:54.755 --> 00:01:58.564
Instead of being like a set piece
in a theatrical narrative scene,

00:01:58.564 --> 00:02:01.694
she becomes a psychological subject.

00:02:01.694 --> 00:02:06.193
Her eye contact and slightly parted lips,
as if she is about to say something,

00:02:06.193 --> 00:02:08.505
draw us into her gaze.

00:02:08.505 --> 00:02:12.945
Traditional subjects of portraiture
were often nobility or religious figures.

00:02:12.945 --> 00:02:16.584
So why was Vermeer painting 
an anonymous girl?

00:02:16.584 --> 00:02:20.454
In the 17th century, the city of Delft,
like the Netherlands in general,

00:02:20.454 --> 00:02:25.044
had turned against ruling aristocracy
and the Catholic church.

00:02:25.044 --> 00:02:27.951
After eight decades of rebellion
against Spanish power,

00:02:27.951 --> 00:02:34.202
the Dutch came to favor the idea
of self-rule and a political republic.

00:02:34.202 --> 00:02:37.871
Cities like Delft were unsupervised
by kings or bishops,

00:02:37.871 --> 00:02:42.941
so many artists like Vermeer
were left without traditional patrons.

00:02:42.941 --> 00:02:44.920
Fortunately, business innovation

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.562
spearheaded by 
the Dutch East India Company

00:02:47.562 --> 00:02:51.084
transformed the economic landscape
in the Netherlands.

00:02:51.084 --> 00:02:55.371
It created a merchant class
and new type of patron.

00:02:55.371 --> 00:02:58.242
Wishing to be represented
in the paintings they financed,

00:02:58.242 --> 00:03:00.741
these merchants preferred 
middle class subjects

00:03:00.741 --> 00:03:03.683
depicted in spaces that looked
like their own homes

00:03:03.683 --> 00:03:05.832
surrounded by familiar objects.

00:03:05.832 --> 00:03:08.583
The maps that appear in Vermeer's
paintings, for example,

00:03:08.583 --> 00:03:11.040
were considered fashionable and worldly

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.638
by the merchant class of what is known
as the Dutch Golden Age.

00:03:15.638 --> 00:03:18.692
The oriental turban worn by the "Girl
with the Pearl Earring"

00:03:18.692 --> 00:03:22.708
also emphasizes the worldliness
of the merchant class,

00:03:22.708 --> 00:03:27.443
and the pearl itself, a symbol of wealth,
is actually an exaggeration.

00:03:27.443 --> 00:03:31.514
Vermeer couldn't have afforded
a real pearl of its size.

00:03:31.514 --> 00:03:36.531
It was likely just a glass or tin drop
varnished to look like a pearl.

00:03:36.531 --> 00:03:40.223
This mirage of wealth is mirrored
in the painting itself.

00:03:40.223 --> 00:03:43.903
In greater context, the pearl appears
round and heavy,

00:03:43.903 --> 00:03:48.713
but a detailed view shows that it's
just a floating smudge of paint.

00:03:48.713 --> 00:03:54.574
Upon close inspection, we are reminded
of Vermeer's power as an illusion maker.

00:03:54.574 --> 00:03:58.213
While we may never know the real identity
of the "Girl with the Pearl Earring,"

00:03:58.213 --> 00:04:01.923
we can engage with her portrait
in a way that is unforgettable.

00:04:01.923 --> 00:04:06.463
As she hangs in her permanent home
in the Mauritshuis Museum in The Hague,

00:04:06.463 --> 00:04:10.293
her presence is simultaneously penetrating
and subtle.

00:04:10.293 --> 00:04:14.694
In her enigmatic way, she represents
the birth of a modern perspective

00:04:14.694 --> 00:04:17.544
on economics, politics, and love.
