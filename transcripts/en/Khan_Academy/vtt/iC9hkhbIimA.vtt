00:00:00.591 --> 00:00:02.189
- [Instructor] What we're
going to do in this video

00:00:02.189 --> 00:00:05.468
is a deep dive into the
difference between demand

00:00:05.468 --> 00:00:07.537
and quantity demanded.

00:00:07.537 --> 00:00:09.607
In particular, we're gonna
focus on change in demand

00:00:09.607 --> 00:00:11.902
versus change in quantity demanded.

00:00:11.902 --> 00:00:15.027
And so just as context, I
have price versus quantity

00:00:15.027 --> 00:00:18.578
here for brand X of
cars in a certain market

00:00:18.578 --> 00:00:21.781
and you see the demand
curve for brand X of cars

00:00:21.781 --> 00:00:25.280
and we see the it follows
the classic law of demand.

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:29.447
At a high price, there is
a low quantity demanded,

00:00:31.056 --> 00:00:34.307
and so this is already trying
to draw the distinction.

00:00:34.307 --> 00:00:37.718
A quantity demanded,
so I'll call this qd1,

00:00:37.718 --> 00:00:41.167
is associated with a particular
point on the demand curve,

00:00:41.167 --> 00:00:43.225
it's not the whole curve itself.

00:00:43.225 --> 00:00:45.016
When people talk about demand,

00:00:45.016 --> 00:00:47.352
they're talking about the whole curve.

00:00:47.352 --> 00:00:49.409
But just following on of what I just said,

00:00:49.409 --> 00:00:52.192
following the law of
demand at a low price,

00:00:52.192 --> 00:00:56.028
this is associated with, if
we go to the demand curve,

00:00:56.028 --> 00:01:00.028
a high quantity demanded,
quantity demanded two.

00:01:01.793 --> 00:01:04.319
And so to be very particular about this,

00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:07.433
quantity demanded is associated
with a particular point

00:01:07.433 --> 00:01:10.350
on the demand curve while
the demand curve is the set

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.668
of all of these points that
show how price and quantity

00:01:13.668 --> 00:01:14.918
are associated.

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:18.740
So with that out of the way,
to make things more tangible,

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:21.557
let's go through a bunch
of different circumstances

00:01:21.557 --> 00:01:23.248
and think about whether they would result

00:01:23.248 --> 00:01:27.415
in a change in demand versus
a change in quantity demanded.

00:01:31.651 --> 00:01:34.308
So in this first scenario
we say car dealerships

00:01:34.308 --> 00:01:36.918
slash prices by 10%.

00:01:36.918 --> 00:01:39.144
Would that result in a change in demand,

00:01:39.144 --> 00:01:41.504
which would involve
shifting our demand curve,

00:01:41.504 --> 00:01:44.375
or would it involve a
shift along the curve,

00:01:44.375 --> 00:01:46.702
a change in quantity demanded?

00:01:46.702 --> 00:01:49.783
Pause the video and try to figure it out.

00:01:49.783 --> 00:01:52.907
Well, there's a couple of
ways to think about it.

00:01:52.907 --> 00:01:55.529
In order to shift the demand curve itself

00:01:55.529 --> 00:01:58.285
the one way I think about
it is if you were to pick

00:01:58.285 --> 00:02:02.156
a given price, if you were
to pick a given price,

00:02:02.156 --> 00:02:06.900
does what's described here
in any way shift the quantity

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:10.146
that would demanded at that price?

00:02:10.146 --> 00:02:12.855
Well, no, this is not
shifting how much consumers

00:02:12.855 --> 00:02:15.273
would want to buy at that price.

00:02:15.273 --> 00:02:18.822
This is just shifting the price itself.

00:02:18.822 --> 00:02:22.286
So this is going to be a
shift along the demand curve.

00:02:22.286 --> 00:02:26.124
So this would be a scenario where maybe

00:02:26.124 --> 00:02:28.549
the equilibrium price, and
we'll talk more about that

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:32.972
in future videos, maybe
the equilibrium price

00:02:32.972 --> 00:02:35.422
and quantity demanded are
associated with that point

00:02:35.422 --> 00:02:38.767
right over here before car
dealers slashed their prices.

00:02:38.767 --> 00:02:41.410
So let's call this quantity demanded,

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:43.788
let's call that quantity demanded three.

00:02:43.788 --> 00:02:46.132
But then when they slashed their prices,

00:02:46.132 --> 00:02:51.046
the prices go down, and so
we end up with this point

00:02:51.046 --> 00:02:55.213
on our demand curve, and so
this would be quantity demanded,

00:02:56.496 --> 00:02:59.014
quantity demanded four.

00:02:59.014 --> 00:03:00.871
So this would be a change

00:03:00.871 --> 00:03:04.202
in quantity demanded right over here,

00:03:04.202 --> 00:03:07.452
so change, I'll do delta for change in,

00:03:08.357 --> 00:03:11.049
change in quantity demanded.

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:15.523
And in this case, the
quantity demanded would go up.

00:03:15.523 --> 00:03:18.576
What about the price
of gasoline increases?

00:03:18.576 --> 00:03:19.409
Pause this video.

00:03:19.409 --> 00:03:20.242
Think about what would happen.

00:03:20.242 --> 00:03:22.524
Would that change the
quantity demanded for the cars

00:03:22.524 --> 00:03:26.189
or would it shift the entire demand curve?

00:03:26.189 --> 00:03:28.605
Well, I'll do the same exercise.

00:03:28.605 --> 00:03:30.042
Pick a given price.

00:03:30.042 --> 00:03:31.989
Let's say we're at this
price right over here

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:35.464
and this is the current quantity demanded,

00:03:35.464 --> 00:03:39.108
now if all of a sudden, actually
for any price that I pick,

00:03:39.108 --> 00:03:41.605
if the price of gasoline increases,

00:03:41.605 --> 00:03:45.245
consumers will just have
less money in their pocket,

00:03:45.245 --> 00:03:49.670
the cost of maintaining and
using a car at any price

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:53.611
would go up, and so they
might be willing to buy

00:03:53.611 --> 00:03:57.567
less cars because the
operating cost has gone up.

00:03:57.567 --> 00:04:00.891
And this would be true at
any price, at any price.

00:04:00.891 --> 00:04:02.572
And so one way to think about it is

00:04:02.572 --> 00:04:06.210
the entire demand curve, the
way I've just phrased it,

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:11.142
you could view for the entire
demand curve would shift.

00:04:11.142 --> 00:04:15.225
So if we call this D1
here, now this would be D2.

00:04:16.231 --> 00:04:19.398
So here we would say change in demand,

00:04:20.363 --> 00:04:22.591
and in this case, our change in demand,

00:04:22.591 --> 00:04:26.063
it would shift, it would go down.

00:04:26.063 --> 00:04:28.775
You could view it as shifting to the left.

00:04:28.775 --> 00:04:31.063
Actually, let me write that
as shifting to the left

00:04:31.063 --> 00:04:33.995
because that's what it
looks like on this graph.

00:04:33.995 --> 00:04:35.745
Let's do this third example,

00:04:35.745 --> 00:04:38.618
prices of public transportation goes down,

00:04:38.618 --> 00:04:39.773
what would happen?

00:04:39.773 --> 00:04:41.485
Is this a change in quantity demanded

00:04:41.485 --> 00:04:44.537
or would it be a shift
in the demand curve?

00:04:44.537 --> 00:04:48.370
Well, once again, for
any, for any given price

00:04:49.286 --> 00:04:52.270
that we are talking about,
whether we're talking about here

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:54.214
or whether we're talking about here,

00:04:54.214 --> 00:04:56.431
the substitute or one of the substitutes,

00:04:56.431 --> 00:04:57.869
which is public transportation,

00:04:57.869 --> 00:05:00.529
is now looking more favorable.

00:05:00.529 --> 00:05:02.966
So you could imagine
people at a given price

00:05:02.966 --> 00:05:06.510
will just not demand, the
market will just not demand

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:07.808
as much of a quantity.

00:05:07.808 --> 00:05:09.164
And so this, once again,

00:05:09.164 --> 00:05:11.677
would be a change in the demand curve.

00:05:11.677 --> 00:05:14.218
When something is true for any given price

00:05:14.218 --> 00:05:16.390
along the curve, then you
know that you're going to be

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:17.308
shifting the curve.

00:05:17.308 --> 00:05:20.252
So our change in demand, and once again,

00:05:20.252 --> 00:05:22.531
we're going to shift to the left,

00:05:22.531 --> 00:05:24.781
so it's similar to bullet point two.

00:05:24.781 --> 00:05:27.308
Now, let's see, here
we say the state lowers

00:05:27.308 --> 00:05:29.375
vehicle registration fees.

00:05:29.375 --> 00:05:32.126
Pause the video and think about that.

00:05:32.126 --> 00:05:34.840
Well, once again, regardless
of where we might be sitting

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:38.263
along the demand curve
now, if registration fees

00:05:38.263 --> 00:05:40.875
has gone down, now the
total cost of ownership

00:05:40.875 --> 00:05:43.815
of a car has gone down,
and so for any given price,

00:05:43.815 --> 00:05:47.866
people might be able to
demand a little bit more car.

00:05:47.866 --> 00:05:51.215
And so here we would have
a shift of the demand curve

00:05:51.215 --> 00:05:52.298
to the right.

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:55.101
Shift of the demand curve to the right.

00:05:55.101 --> 00:05:57.460
We could call this D3 right over here.

00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:00.294
So we have a change in
the entire demand curve,

00:06:00.294 --> 00:06:03.693
not just quantity demanded,
and we are going to the right.

00:06:03.693 --> 00:06:06.837
Let's do this, what is
this, the fifth example.

00:06:06.837 --> 00:06:10.754
A recession leads to
falling household incomes.

00:06:11.743 --> 00:06:14.158
Pause this video and think about it.

00:06:14.158 --> 00:06:17.402
Well, falling household
incomes is actually

00:06:17.402 --> 00:06:20.499
analogous in some ways to the
price of gasoline increases

00:06:20.499 --> 00:06:22.249
because people are just
going to have less incomes

00:06:22.249 --> 00:06:25.757
regardless of what point
we are on the curve.

00:06:25.757 --> 00:06:28.207
People are just going
to be able to buy less.

00:06:28.207 --> 00:06:30.727
So that's going to shift the demand curve,

00:06:30.727 --> 00:06:33.324
the entire demand curve to the left.

00:06:33.324 --> 00:06:36.209
So it's a shift in demand
or a change in demand

00:06:36.209 --> 00:06:38.851
once again going to the left.

00:06:38.851 --> 00:06:42.765
Last but not least, consumers
expect new car prices

00:06:42.765 --> 00:06:44.265
to rise next year.

00:06:45.822 --> 00:06:48.739
What is that going to do to either,

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:51.805
is that going to be a
change in demand or a change

00:06:51.805 --> 00:06:53.182
in quantity demanded?

00:06:53.182 --> 00:06:56.599
Pause the video and think about it.

00:06:56.599 --> 00:06:58.825
Well, once again, this
is something that applies

00:06:58.825 --> 00:07:00.895
regardless of where we happen to sit

00:07:00.895 --> 00:07:02.589
at a given moment on the curve,

00:07:02.589 --> 00:07:04.214
whatever the equilibrium price is,

00:07:04.214 --> 00:07:07.125
and we'll talk more about
that in other videos.

00:07:07.125 --> 00:07:09.467
This is generally going
to apply to any point

00:07:09.467 --> 00:07:10.834
that we are on the curve.

00:07:10.834 --> 00:07:14.086
If people expect prices to increase,

00:07:14.086 --> 00:07:15.587
if all of a sudden there's
a bulletin that says,

00:07:15.587 --> 00:07:19.260
Hey, car prices are going
to double next year,

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:22.025
well then you can imagine
wherever we are on the curve,

00:07:22.025 --> 00:07:23.642
people are going to say, Oh, if car prices

00:07:23.642 --> 00:07:25.128
are going to double next year,

00:07:25.128 --> 00:07:28.096
I better buy more car right now,

00:07:28.096 --> 00:07:30.872
so our entire demand
curve is going to shift

00:07:30.872 --> 00:07:34.031
to the right, so it's a change
in the entire demand curve,

00:07:34.031 --> 00:07:37.196
and it is going to go to the right.

00:07:37.196 --> 00:07:39.775
So the big picture here,
if we're talking about

00:07:39.775 --> 00:07:43.004
a change in, well you could say a change

00:07:43.004 --> 00:07:45.946
in a particular price,
someone raises the price

00:07:45.946 --> 00:07:48.421
or lowers the price, well
that's going to change

00:07:48.421 --> 00:07:50.399
the quantity demanded.

00:07:50.399 --> 00:07:52.625
And later when we draw the supply curve

00:07:52.625 --> 00:07:54.388
and we see where they
intersect and you have

00:07:54.388 --> 00:07:58.418
an equilibrium price, when one
or both of the curves shift,

00:07:58.418 --> 00:08:02.095
their intersecting point
changes and so then you will,

00:08:02.095 --> 00:08:03.885
you could have a shift in the curves,

00:08:03.885 --> 00:08:08.832
which will then result in a
change in the quantity demanded.

00:08:08.832 --> 00:08:11.736
But if we're talking about
things that are generally

00:08:11.736 --> 00:08:15.256
true regardless of where
we are on the curve,

00:08:15.256 --> 00:08:18.189
that will just affect
people's general demand

00:08:18.189 --> 00:08:22.341
for something, that is going
to shift the entire curve,

00:08:22.341 --> 00:08:23.738
it's going to be a change in demand

00:08:23.738 --> 00:08:26.563
versus a change in quantity demanded.
