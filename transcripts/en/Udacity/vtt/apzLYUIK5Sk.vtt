00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:02.770
Congratulations, you've reached
the end of the first lesson.

00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:05.790
And you've learned the principles that
are the basis of Dev ops, culture,

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.170
automation, measurement, and sharing.

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:11.050
In the next lesson, we'll go deeper
into the culture, automation and

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:11.830
sharing topics.

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:14.440
And not only in theory,
but also in practice.

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:17.040
&gt;&gt; And now you have an idea where
we're coming from with this course.

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:19.080
We'd like to know where
you're coming from too.

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:19.810
On the next page,

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:22.840
there's a link to a survey about
your background and experience.

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:24.150
And what you think of the course.

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:25.960
Please take a moment to fill it out.

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:27.280
&gt;&gt; Then, we'll see you in lesson two.
