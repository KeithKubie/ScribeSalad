00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:21.490
GUEST SPEAKER 1:
So we built a game.

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:23.740
It's a baseball
game, so you have

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:28.610
control over this bat using a
potentiometer, and it swings.

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:35.680
Use it to hit the ball.

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:38.239
GUEST SPEAKER 2: So this
ball, it's really irregular

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:39.530
because it's just made of tape.

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:42.074
But Ideally, you'd
have an actual sphere.

00:00:42.074 --> 00:00:42.990
GUEST SPEAKER 1: And--

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:44.370
oops-- and that's a strike.

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:44.775
GUEST SPEAKER 2: Strike.

00:00:44.775 --> 00:00:47.070
And then it comes out of a
bar or two which can't see.

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.080
But both the home
run and a strike

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:52.530
will empty out into this chute
down here below the table.

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.845
GUEST SPEAKER 3: Oh, it
went a little too far down.

00:00:54.845 --> 00:00:56.136
GUEST SPEAKER 2: It's all good.

00:00:56.136 --> 00:00:57.767
GUEST SPEAKER 3:
Which spin was it?

00:00:57.767 --> 00:00:58.850
GUEST SPEAKER 1: Oh, yeah.

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:00.794
OK, if you get a home run--

00:01:00.794 --> 00:01:03.114
go ahead.

00:01:03.114 --> 00:01:04.305
It's a very difficult game.

00:01:04.305 --> 00:01:05.180
GUEST SPEAKER 3: Yes.

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:05.946
[LAUGHING]

00:01:05.946 --> 00:01:06.821
GUEST SPEAKER 1: Woo!

00:01:06.821 --> 00:01:07.795
We got a home run.

00:01:07.795 --> 00:01:10.320
GUEST SPEAKER 3: And then
there's a tap sensor here.

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.790
So she scored a home
run and it displays one.

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:15.990
And now it's displaying
much more than that.

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.560
GUEST SPEAKER 2: So where's
it-- it's a prototype.

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.384
GUEST SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:01:20.384 --> 00:01:23.080
GUEST SPEAKER 4: Activate
LEDs the first time.

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:24.750
But the models were
really unreliable,

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.826
because just by
moving the bread board

00:01:26.826 --> 00:01:28.200
it would activate
and deactivate.

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.465
And by moving the buttons, it
would turn on and off the LEDs.

00:01:31.465 --> 00:01:34.482
Or not turn the LEDs, even
if the button was pressed.

00:01:34.482 --> 00:01:35.940
So that was really
hard, and that's

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:38.990
why we switched to
the [INAUDIBLE]..
