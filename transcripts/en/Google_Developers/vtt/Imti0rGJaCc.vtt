TIMOTHY JORDAN:
Hello, and welcome

00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:04.240
to "The Developer Show."

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:06.260
This is your TLDR.

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:08.330
Project Tango is
hosting workshops

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:10.424
to help bring indoor
location apps to life.

00:00:10.424 --> 00:00:12.590
You may remember our visit
to one of these workshops

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:13.660
a couple episodes ago.

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:14.860
It was really cool.

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:18.390
Follow the link to read more
and submit your own idea.

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.390
To help your business
grow, we are significantly

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:23.310
increasing the size limits of
all Google Compute Engine block

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.000
storage products, including up
to three terabytes of local SSD

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.910
and 64 terabytes of persistent
disk per virtual machine.

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:33.480
Check out the post
for more details.

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.340
If you enjoy debating the merits
of the spark and data flow

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:38.790
programming models, you
get excited at the idea

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.382
of processing terabytes in
seconds with zero setup,

00:00:42.382 --> 00:00:44.590
or simply want to learn how
to use the infrastructure

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:47.260
that powers Google for
your data processing work,

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.730
this new blog on
big data is for you.

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.407
Dart 1.14 is now
available and contains

00:00:53.407 --> 00:00:54.990
a number of additions
and improvements

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:57.000
across our core
libraries and tools,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.890
including progress
towards eliminating

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.990
symbolic links and a new way
to access package assets easily

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:05.170
and reliably.

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:08.420
The newest Chrome Beta release
includes CSS custom properties,

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:10.230
background sync with
service workers,

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:13.090
and new ECMAScript
2015 features.

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:16.036
Check out the blog
post and the Beta.

00:01:16.036 --> 00:01:17.410
Over the last
couple weeks, we've

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:19.120
published a bunch
of new articles

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:20.840
on our Web Updates page.

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:22.770
Check out all the
great new content,

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.610
including information
on ECMAScript proxies,

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:29.250
controlling font
performance, and more.

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.820
Invalid activity consists
of any clicks or impressions

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.000
that may artificially
inflate an advertiser's costs

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.130
or a publisher's earnings.

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:43.110
Learn how you can avoid invalid
activity with these quick tips.

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.980
Intelligence is not the product
of any singular mechanism

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:47.930
but comes from the
managed interaction

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:51.730
of a diverse variety
of resourceful agents.

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:55.030
This and other big ideas came
from the work of Marvin Minsky,

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:57.220
a pioneer in
artificial intelligence

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:00.330
and winner of Turing
Award in 1969.

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:02.550
He recently died
at the age of 88.

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:05.190
For more on Minsky's work,
check out this great article

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:08.370
by the "The New York Times."

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:10.280
Women Techmakers is
Google's global program

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.890
for women in tech and is hosting
14 summits at Google offices,

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.790
and 100 meet-ups are expected
with Google Developer groups

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:19.020
globally to celebrate
International Women's

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:20.840
Day in March and April.

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.800
Follow the link and
apply to attend.

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.060
They're going to be awesome.

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:26.810
That's your TLDR for this week.

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:28.890
Now, you may notice
that I'm in front

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.290
of a highly refined and
sophisticated podcast studio.

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:35.590
We've taken down the
Android UI toolkit fan art,

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:39.060
but you can still probably guess
this is where Chet Haas and Tor

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:43.090
Norbye record their podcast
"Android Developers Backstage."

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:45.540
I talked shop with Chet
and Tor earlier today,

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.878
and this is how it went.

00:02:47.878 --> 00:02:49.854
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:02:49.854 --> 00:02:52.810
-Hello, and welcome to
"Android Developers Backstage,"

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:53.310
the podcast.

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:54.708
I'm Chet Haase from--

00:02:54.708 --> 00:02:57.980
-I'm Tor Norbye from the
Android [INAUDIBLE] team.

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:01.096
-We're kind of backstage at
"Android Developers Backstage,"

00:03:01.096 --> 00:03:01.970
which is pretty neat.

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:03.420
This is your clubhouse.

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.080
-Actually, this is the
backstage and the front stage.

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.780
We're engineers.

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:07.660
We get one stage.

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:10.150
-So let's talk about "Android
Developers Backstage."

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:10.750
What is it?

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:12.083
How'd you come up with the idea?

00:03:12.083 --> 00:03:13.400
It's been around for two years.

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.900
-Yeah.

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:16.740
-Are you filling a need
here, or is this your hobby?

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:19.370
-Are we-- I don't want to
think about that too deeply.

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:22.430
Has my life been
worthwhile, or is it just

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:24.320
a pile of meaninglessness?

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:26.510
I'm just going to go home
make a warm bath with--

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:28.830
-It's actually fun
for us because it's

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:31.337
a way for us to talk to
people that we work with,

00:03:31.337 --> 00:03:32.920
but we don't really
know what they do.

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:35.420
And this is the perfect excuse
to ask all the dumb questions

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:38.030
that we wouldn't probably
otherwise admit to not knowing.

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:39.940
-Actually. yeah, the
funnest part of the show

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:41.370
is that we're actually
learning about stuff.

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:43.090
I think there the reason
it works, at least I'm

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:44.465
going to pretend
that it actually

00:03:44.465 --> 00:03:46.840
works for people, because
the whole point of the show

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:49.560
is to teach people or
educate people or help people

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:51.770
understand deeper parts of
the platform, the bigger

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:53.530
picture of how
Android works, how

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:58.160
technology works in general,
APIs, deeper stuff, whatever.

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:00.780
And it's not like we're
pretending, giving

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:02.816
prompting questions so
that those people can

00:04:02.816 --> 00:04:03.690
talk to the audience.

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:05.210
No, they're talking to us.

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:06.990
We don't know either.

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:09.170
So we talk to people
who are domain experts

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:11.120
in the thing that they do.

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:13.475
And then they tell us about
it, and along the way,

00:04:13.475 --> 00:04:15.350
they happen to be speaking
into a microphone.

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:16.558
We happen to be recording it.

00:04:16.558 --> 00:04:18.459
And hopefully, other
people are benefiting

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:20.000
from the conversation as well.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.500
-Who's the most surprising
guest that came on?

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:26.380
And it's like, I had no idea
that was true about Android.

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:28.860
-For me, it was one
of the early episodes.

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:29.974
It was on security.

00:04:29.974 --> 00:04:31.890
And I wasn't expecting
to be as fun as it was.

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:36.169
But that episode with
Adrian Ludwig on security,

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:37.460
didn't he have some background?

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:39.660
He'd been working for like the--

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:40.836
-NSA or CIA?

00:04:40.836 --> 00:04:41.960
- --yeah, CIA or something.

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:43.350
And he was just
totally-- he would

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:45.558
talk about things I didn't
think he would talk about,

00:04:45.558 --> 00:04:47.644
like what we thought of
virus checkers on Android

00:04:47.644 --> 00:04:48.310
and things like.

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:49.750
So I remember that episode.

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:53.780
I was really surprised by how it
was just surprisingly exciting.

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:56.710
-So a couple things, I think
the episode in particular

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:59.310
that I though that we could
have just gone on for days,

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:01.680
and we actually did break
it into two was art.

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:03.990
So we had Anwar on to talk
about garbage collectors,

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:07.040
which being a graphics person,
I wouldn't think that I would

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:08.790
find inherently
interesting, because there

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:09.930
are no pixels involved.

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:12.755
But it's fascinating actually,
the way the runtime works,

00:05:12.755 --> 00:05:14.130
the way garbage
collection works,

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:15.957
the way you can
optimize these things,

00:05:15.957 --> 00:05:17.790
the way things have
gotten better over time.

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:19.230
So we just sort of
went on and on and on,

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:20.960
and it was an hour
and a half later.

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:23.110
-So what you think is the
coolest thing happening

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:24.770
in the development
community right now,

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:26.930
not the stuff that we're making
available via the platform,

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:28.600
but the coolest
thing that developers

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:29.680
are doing with Android?

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:32.680
-Well, so if you're only
just doing the platform,

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:34.540
then I would say
Android Studio, clearly.

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:36.200
Because that's not the
platform, but it's something

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:37.360
that is super exciting.

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:38.830
-Yeah, and the
speed improvements

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:40.670
are incredible with instant run.

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:42.350
-I don't know, I mean, the
great thing about the platform,

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:44.650
it's such a huge ecosystem
with developers is people

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:46.340
do all kinds of crazy stuff.

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:48.580
-I think that's the
thing with Android that's

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:51.900
really cool is that every week
or so there's something just

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:54.095
really surprising that
somebody's doing with Android

00:05:54.095 --> 00:05:55.220
that's really, really cool.

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:57.178
-I think actually one of
the guests that we had

00:05:57.178 --> 00:05:58.720
on that was surprising
to us, or we

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:00.220
knew about it going
into the studio,

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:02.310
but the nearby stuff
I was really cool

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:06.900
was like using audio as like
a transmission protocol.

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:08.390
-The ultrasonic audio.

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:09.855
-Yeah, that was
such a neat hack.

00:06:09.855 --> 00:06:11.730
-Well, what I think is
really neat about that

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:16.890
is blending that with Bluetooth,
low energy, and other things

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:18.490
sort of in the background.

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:22.170
And so you get that stuff,
no matter how it happens.

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:24.600
I think that's
what's really cool.

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:27.379
So I think we're
nearly out of time.

00:06:27.379 --> 00:06:29.920
Is there anything else you want
to tell people about "Android

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:31.430
Developers Backstage"
that you don't

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:33.100
get to talk about on the show?

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:34.330
-Listen?

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:37.320
-Yeah, that's what I
like about podcasts,

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:41.617
that I can listen to podcasts
while I'm driving or doing

00:06:41.617 --> 00:06:42.810
dishes or whatever.

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:45.440
So it's a good way to get
more technical knowledge

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:47.021
while it's downtime.

00:06:47.021 --> 00:06:48.770
-I think that's all
the time that we have.

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:51.210
Chet, Tor, thank you very
much for taking the time

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:53.330
to chat with me about
stuff and things.

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:55.650
