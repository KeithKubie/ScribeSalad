1
00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:04.800
What is the Gospel and how should we read it?

2
00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.100
Popular opinion may think that the gospels are biographies of Jesus,

3
00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.660
but they're not biographies,
at least not a new thing like the modern sense.

4
00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.390
We don't get much of a personal portrait of Jesus from the Gospels.

5
00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:23.580
We don't know anything about how he developed,

6
00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:28.290
how he went from being an obnoxious teenager to being an apocalyptic prophet.

7
00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:31.590
We don't know him about his relationship to his parents,

8
00:00:31.591 --> 00:00:33.240
his brothers and sisters.
We don't know.

9
00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.860
We don't know all kinds of things that a modern biography would automatically be

10
00:00:37.861 --> 00:00:42.270
expected to tell you.
So the gospels aren't biographies.

11
00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:45.780
Somebody has one set of scholar,

12
00:00:45.781 --> 00:00:50.010
one's called mark a passion narrative with an extended introduction.

13
00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.450
Well,
what's a passion?
Narrative?
Passion comes from the Latin Passio,

14
00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.870
which doesn't mean just desire.
It could mean that in the actual world,

15
00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.250
but it also means suffering.
Suffering is what passio means,

16
00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.370
and so it's the suffering of Jesus that happens at his arrest,

17
00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.280
his trial,
His crucifixion,
and the resurrection.

18
00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.940
All of that's part of what scholars call the passion narrative.

19
00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.630
And if you notice that occupies a huge part of the gospel of mark.

20
00:01:20.641 --> 00:01:23.610
The Gospel of Mark is our shortest gospel that's in the Canon.

21
00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.550
It's only 16 chapters in your course.

22
00:01:26.551 --> 00:01:29.550
The chapters and verse numbers weren't there and the original manuscripts,

23
00:01:29.551 --> 00:01:30.271
it was just written.
In fact,

24
00:01:30.271 --> 00:01:33.030
they even divide up words and they had very little punctuation.

25
00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.250
It was just one capitol letter after another,

26
00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.120
which is one of the reasons that ancient people tended to read text out loud.

27
00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:42.480
They didn't read silently to themselves and whether he is cause it was easier to

28
00:01:42.481 --> 00:01:46.080
read a text that had node word divisions.
It was all capital letters,

29
00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.870
no punctuation.
And it wasn't divided up into sentences.

30
00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.540
It was much easier to read that if you read it out loud to yourself.

31
00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.040
So that's the way ancient people read.

32
00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.340
But so we don't have chapter numbers and verse divisions.

33
00:01:56.341 --> 00:02:00.420
Those are all later creations that came about in the Middle Ages in
Christianity.

34
00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:05.670
But,
uh,
there's if by modern reckoning,

35
00:02:05.671 --> 00:02:08.610
therefore they're 16 chapters in mark,
that's the shortest gospel.

36
00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:13.760
And of that one third of mark is just the last week of Jesus' life.

37
00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.670
The Passion narrative part of it.
So one does a scholar said,

38
00:02:17.671 --> 00:02:20.790
mark is really a passion narrative with an extended introduction.

39
00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.980
Notice what you get if you have an outline of mark chapter one verse one is the

40
00:02:25.981 --> 00:02:30.930
title,
the Young Deleon or the gospel of uh,
according to Jesus,
you know,

41
00:02:30.931 --> 00:02:32.760
Jesus Christ.
And uh,

42
00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:36.070
it doesn't say according to mark in the title because that name was led,

43
00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.070
edited later.
That's the title of the book.

44
00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.970
And then for the next few verses from one to that is chapter one,

45
00:02:41.971 --> 00:02:46.110
verse two to verse 13 you get an initial introduction to Jesus,

46
00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:51.060
just a little bit about him.
Then from one 14 to nine 50.

47
00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.650
So nine chapters is Jesus has Galilean ministry.

48
00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:56.520
His healings,

49
00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:00.760
his teachings is traveling around his miracles that all take place in Galilee,

50
00:03:00.761 --> 00:03:01.780
which is where he's from.

51
00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:06.220
That's of course the northern part of Palette of Palestine where it's Judea is

52
00:03:06.221 --> 00:03:11.221
down in the southern part of Palestine and then versus chapters 11 through 15

53
00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:16.270
are all just the last week in Jerusalem.
Again,
five chapters,

54
00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:17.590
Justin is last week.

55
00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:23.640
And then chapter 16 one through eight is rumors of the resurrection.

56
00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:26.440
Why do I say rumors of the resurrection?

57
00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:28.960
Because if you'll notice in the gospel of Mark,

58
00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:32.470
if mark ends at Chapter 16,
Verse Eight,

59
00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:35.530
and there's been some controversy about whether it really is supposed to end

60
00:03:35.531 --> 00:03:40.270
there,
but in most of your modern additions,
it ends at 16 eight.
If that's true,

61
00:03:40.271 --> 00:03:43.610
you don't actually see the resurrected Jesus.
You just get,

62
00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:45.580
he doesn't appear on the stage,
so to speak.

63
00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.350
You only get reports that he has been raised or one report that he's raised.

64
00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:55.060
And then the women are told by this young man who's sitting at the tomb,

65
00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:58.090
probably supposed to represent an angel,
uh,

66
00:03:58.091 --> 00:04:00.790
to go and tell the other disciples that he's raised and he'll go before them to

67
00:04:00.791 --> 00:04:01.450
Galilee.

68
00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:04.180
But notice the women don't tell them that says the women were afraid and they

69
00:04:04.181 --> 00:04:08.800
ran away.
So you don't even get mini reports about Jesus' resurrection.
In mark.

70
00:04:08.801 --> 00:04:12.310
You just get the one young man at the tune telling the women that he's been

71
00:04:12.311 --> 00:04:17.080
raised.
So a huge bulk of the book tells us about the last week of Jesus' life.

72
00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:20.680
And even in the previous 10 chapters of the book,

73
00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:25.390
you have Jesus talking about his upcoming crucifixion.

74
00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:30.160
So these passion predictions we call them,
did occur in the gospel.

75
00:04:30.161 --> 00:04:32.050
You have several of those in the gospel of mark.

76
00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:36.400
So there are several references to use this upcoming death that focuses our

77
00:04:36.401 --> 00:04:40.390
attention even more on the last part of the book.
Is that important?

78
00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:45.160
Does that tell us anything about what sort of thing Mark's Gospel is?

79
00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:46.270
If it's not a biography,

80
00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:53.040
let's look at the ending also mark 16 now remember I want you to bring your

81
00:04:53.141 --> 00:04:57.550
bibles to class.
Why do I want you to bring your bibles to class?

82
00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:01.480
Yes.
Cause I will lie to you.

83
00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:05.590
I may say something that's not true and you need to check me out.

84
00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:09.460
They all knew boost to be tandem.
When the Sabbath was over.

85
00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:12.130
Mark 16 Mary Magdalene and Mary,

86
00:05:12.131 --> 00:05:15.340
the mother of James and Salome brought spices so that they might go and anoint

87
00:05:15.341 --> 00:05:19.000
him.
And very early on,
the first day of the week when the sun had risen,

88
00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:20.020
they went to the tomb.

89
00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:23.020
They had been saying to one another who will roll away the stone for us from the

90
00:05:23.021 --> 00:05:25.780
entrance to the tomb.
When they looked up,
they saw that the stone,

91
00:05:25.781 --> 00:05:29.230
which was very large,
had already been rolled back as they entered the tomb.

92
00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:33.970
They saw a young man dressed in a white robe sitting on the right side and they

93
00:05:33.971 --> 00:05:36.730
were alarmed,
but he said to them,
do not be alarmed.

94
00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:39.100
You are looking for Jesus of Nazareth who was crucified.

95
00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:42.760
He's been raised but he's not here.
Look,
there is the place they laid him,

96
00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:47.560
but go tell his disciples and Peter that he is going ahead of you to Galilee.

97
00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:50.170
There you will see him just as he told you.

98
00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:54.370
So they went out and fled from the tomb for terror and amazement has seized them

99
00:05:54.371 --> 00:05:57.710
and they said nothing to anyone for they were afraid.

100
00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:01.280
Now you'll notice there's,
and maybe some of your bibles,

101
00:06:01.281 --> 00:06:03.620
there will be a paragraph into that titled a shorter ending,

102
00:06:03.621 --> 00:06:06.800
the shorter ending of mark.
All the had been a commanded them.

103
00:06:06.801 --> 00:06:09.020
They briefly told her those around Peter afterward.

104
00:06:09.021 --> 00:06:11.450
Jesus himself went through them from east to west,
the sacred,

105
00:06:11.451 --> 00:06:13.880
imperishable proclamation of eternal salvation.

106
00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:17.990
And then you'll notice there's maybe a few paragraphs call by your editors,

107
00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:20.840
the longer ending of mark,
and it has several verses.

108
00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:23.300
I'm not gonna Bother to read that to you,
but if you look at that,

109
00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:25.670
the little incidents,
Sarah,

110
00:06:25.671 --> 00:06:29.150
the incidents in that longer ending of mark could sound familiar to you.

111
00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:32.090
If you know the other gospels that how they end,

112
00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:35.510
what scholars now believe is that the,

113
00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:39.740
probably the gospel of Mark Really did end at chapter 16 verse eight some people

114
00:06:39.741 --> 00:06:43.670
said,
well,
that's no way to end a book.
The women don't tell anything.

115
00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:45.770
It just as they were afraid and they run away.
That's it.

116
00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:49.760
And even in the Greek that it ends in is a very short little sentence.

117
00:06:49.761 --> 00:06:54.550
That's an odd way to end a book in Greek.
So some people sought,

118
00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:57.050
scholars have said,
well,
maybe that wasn't originally ending.

119
00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:00.620
Maybe mark was riding along.
He got 69 and he fell over and died.

120
00:07:00.621 --> 00:07:05.621
Of a heart attack or maybe he left the manuscript out and some mice ate at the

121
00:07:06.411 --> 00:07:07.670
end of it because you know,

122
00:07:07.671 --> 00:07:11.810
you roll up a scroll and just have the leftover parts of the at the bar back or

123
00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:15.450
maybe it got in a fire and burnt maybe the last few verses.
The last part of the,

124
00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:16.430
the Gospel Burnt,

125
00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:21.680
obviously ancient people had the same sense of uneasiness with the way with mark

126
00:07:21.681 --> 00:07:25.100
ending at 16 eight and what you got in that shorter ending of the longer ending,

127
00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:27.170
we're later compositions of scribes,

128
00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:30.500
Christian scribes who thought you can't end Mark's gospel that way.

129
00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:34.100
So they made up those other verses and they put them at the end of the

130
00:07:34.101 --> 00:07:35.970
manuscript.
They were copying,
because you remember before,

131
00:07:36.170 --> 00:07:37.340
before printing presses,

132
00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:42.670
all manuscripts had to be made one by one by somebody sitting down with a quill

133
00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:45.980
and ink and Papayas and just copying it word by word.

134
00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:50.000
So other scribes when copying this over must've added that on.

135
00:07:50.001 --> 00:07:52.460
In fact that it looks very much like the longer ending.

136
00:07:52.670 --> 00:07:57.620
It was scribes who knew some events from the other gospels and they took some

137
00:07:57.621 --> 00:07:59.960
events from Matthew,
Luke,
and John,

138
00:08:00.170 --> 00:08:02.600
and they stuck them into a little paragraph and they say,
well,

139
00:08:02.601 --> 00:08:07.160
that must be the way mark really intended to end his Gospel in the 20th century.

140
00:08:07.161 --> 00:08:07.760
Basically,

141
00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:12.050
modern scholars have come to pretty much reject most of those theories and at

142
00:08:12.051 --> 00:08:17.051
least we take the gospel of Mark as ending at 16 eight even intentionally.

143
00:08:17.750 --> 00:08:18.710
But if you do that,

144
00:08:19.010 --> 00:08:22.790
then you still have to explain why and a gospel this way.

145
00:08:22.791 --> 00:08:26.600
It's not a normal way to end the book and it's not the way the other gospels end

146
00:08:26.601 --> 00:08:27.930
at all.
So the,

147
00:08:27.980 --> 00:08:32.980
the very ending of mark is one of the problems of the text that scholars feel

148
00:08:33.051 --> 00:08:33.980
like we have to deal with.

149
00:08:35.570 --> 00:08:40.010
This all demonstrates though that scholars don't read the Gospels as

150
00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:43.310
biographies,
three Ds or as even straightforward accounts of events.

151
00:08:43.370 --> 00:08:47.240
Last time I tried to show you how you can't take the book of acts and Paul's

152
00:08:47.241 --> 00:08:51.770
letters as simply being a historical description of what happened because each

153
00:08:51.771 --> 00:08:53.480
of these documents had agendas.

154
00:08:53.510 --> 00:08:57.480
These authors had things that points they to get across these.

155
00:08:57.540 --> 00:09:01.830
We learned to read these gospels in 20th century by the using the,
uh,

156
00:09:01.950 --> 00:09:03.840
method of historical criticism.

157
00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:08.130
The criticism part of that doesn't mean necessarily being critical of it.

158
00:09:08.130 --> 00:09:12.150
That is criticizing the texts.
It just means reading it with critical eyes,

159
00:09:12.210 --> 00:09:15.930
with questioning eyes with if you were doubting eyes in some cases.

160
00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:17.640
But what we do is we read these texts,

161
00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:19.800
not for what they tell us about the events in the past,

162
00:09:19.801 --> 00:09:20.940
although you can read this,

163
00:09:21.210 --> 00:09:25.110
but we actually read the text as if they were intentional documents written by

164
00:09:25.111 --> 00:09:28.890
authors who had points they want it to make and they tell the story the way they

165
00:09:28.891 --> 00:09:33.600
tell the story because they have a message that the important thing is not what

166
00:09:33.601 --> 00:09:36.540
really happened or what lies behind the text for modern scholars.

167
00:09:36.541 --> 00:09:39.090
Most of the time,
unless you're doing historical Jesus Research,

168
00:09:39.330 --> 00:09:41.910
and I'll lecture about that at one period in later,

169
00:09:42.210 --> 00:09:45.930
but most of the time we're saying what did mark as an author want to do?

170
00:09:45.931 --> 00:09:49.500
And therefore we say,
why would he in the Gospel this way?
Uh,
if he did that.

171
00:09:49.830 --> 00:09:52.200
Now that's notice this historical critical method,

172
00:09:52.201 --> 00:09:55.500
which is what I'm teaching in this class is somewhat different from several

173
00:09:55.501 --> 00:09:56.850
other ways of reading text.

174
00:09:56.910 --> 00:10:00.990
And I'm not implying by this the historical critical method is the correct

175
00:10:00.991 --> 00:10:03.060
method all we'll give you the correct meaning of the text.

176
00:10:03.450 --> 00:10:06.360
I believe that it's perfectly legitimate for Christians,
for example,

177
00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:10.980
to read these texts,
to get something religious out of the text for their lives,

178
00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:13.470
from personal guidance,
for doctrine,

179
00:10:13.650 --> 00:10:16.860
for images of Jesus to help their relationship to God,
whatever.

180
00:10:17.310 --> 00:10:19.410
That's a perfectly legitimate way in my view,

181
00:10:19.411 --> 00:10:21.540
to read a text to read it theologically,

182
00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:25.530
but a theological reading the text is not the same thing as a historical

183
00:10:25.531 --> 00:10:26.580
critical reading of the text.

184
00:10:26.730 --> 00:10:29.580
The historian is what I'm playing my role here in this class.

185
00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:33.990
I don't care whether these texts have anything theological to say to you or to

186
00:10:33.991 --> 00:10:34.824
me personally,

187
00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:39.480
what I care about is what kind of theological message was this original writer

188
00:10:39.481 --> 00:10:41.880
intending to give and to whom was he intending to give it?

189
00:10:42.570 --> 00:10:45.330
So the theological way to reading is one way perfectly fine way,

190
00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:47.430
but it's not the historical critical reading necessarily.

191
00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:49.890
They're also literary ways of reading these texts.

192
00:10:49.891 --> 00:10:53.880
And this has been a very common thing in English departments,
uh,
for uh,
you know,

193
00:10:53.910 --> 00:10:57.510
people to write an account of the gospel of mark.
It's been a particularly

194
00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:04.280
significant gospel for modern literary people to retail or talk about the gospel

195
00:11:04.621 --> 00:11:07.020
of Mark,
do a literary reading of it and they're,

196
00:11:07.021 --> 00:11:09.060
they're looking for things like the plot of it,

197
00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:12.030
the way it accomplishes its story is there,

198
00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:15.900
are there figures and characters and what kind of thing does this character

199
00:11:15.901 --> 00:11:19.350
represent or what kind of thing does this event represent symbolically or

200
00:11:19.351 --> 00:11:23.880
literarily?
So just as you know how to do a literary reading of a novel,

201
00:11:23.970 --> 00:11:27.930
some modern scholars will redo a literary reading of the Gospels.

202
00:11:28.050 --> 00:11:30.090
It's a perfectly legitimate way to read the gospels.

203
00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:32.400
It's just not the one that I'm going to concentrate on in this class.

204
00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:34.050
And there are many,
many others you could say,

205
00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:37.530
I'm going to do a deconstruction is poststructuralist reading of mark and they

206
00:11:37.531 --> 00:11:40.170
had been done.
You can go buy books that have done it,

207
00:11:40.230 --> 00:11:42.120
you can do a structuralist reading of mark,

208
00:11:42.180 --> 00:11:44.220
and those are the dullest ones of hall.

209
00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:47.490
So lots of different ways to read these texts.

210
00:11:47.670 --> 00:11:49.620
And I'm going to teach you the historical critical reading,

211
00:11:49.621 --> 00:11:50.610
which means certain things.

212
00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.280
It means we're not going to read the gospel of Mark Through the Lens of Matthew,

213
00:11:54.370 --> 00:11:58.480
Luke,
or John.
We're going to take marks on gospel as standing on its own.

214
00:11:58.750 --> 00:12:01.750
So we're not going to rush off to another gospel or to act or the letters of

215
00:12:01.751 --> 00:12:05.440
Paul to provide an interpretive clue for how to read.
Mark.

216
00:12:05.470 --> 00:12:08.260
We're gonna read mark as mark by itself.

217
00:12:08.410 --> 00:12:11.830
And that's one of the fundamental rules of historical criticism is don't

218
00:12:11.831 --> 00:12:15.790
harmonize different texts in the Bible.
Take them each individually.

219
00:12:16.570 --> 00:12:19.900
Uh,
another one is you have to avoid anachronism.
That is,

220
00:12:20.020 --> 00:12:22.600
you can't attribute a meaning to the text of mark.

221
00:12:22.780 --> 00:12:27.220
That doesn't make sense in the first century,
in his own context.
For example,

222
00:12:27.310 --> 00:12:28.240
if you're a Christian,

223
00:12:28.270 --> 00:12:32.200
you're going to read some of the songs in the Hebrew Bible as being about Jesus.

224
00:12:32.201 --> 00:12:35.830
Probably most Christians do.
So when the psalmist says,

225
00:12:35.950 --> 00:12:37.900
the Lord said to my Lord,

226
00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:41.020
sit at my right hand and I'll make your enemies your footstool.

227
00:12:41.830 --> 00:12:45.940
Christians have traditionally said the first Lord,
there is God.

228
00:12:45.941 --> 00:12:48.770
And the second Lord is Jesus.
And this is uh,

229
00:12:48.790 --> 00:12:52.570
an old testament reference to the fuck God,
the father and God the son.

230
00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:57.700
And this is a Christological song that's a theological wavering.
The Psalm,

231
00:12:57.850 --> 00:13:01.810
it doesn't pass the test of historical criticism because historians will point

232
00:13:01.811 --> 00:13:05.350
out,
look,
the original som is,
didn't know anything about Jesus.

233
00:13:05.650 --> 00:13:07.840
He wasn't prophesying about Jesus personally.

234
00:13:07.990 --> 00:13:10.290
He was talking probably to the Davidic king today.

235
00:13:10.630 --> 00:13:15.100
The song's meant to talk to David or to David's descendants who sit on the

236
00:13:15.101 --> 00:13:15.934
throne of Judah.

237
00:13:16.630 --> 00:13:20.650
So anachronism has to be avoided in historical critical readings.

238
00:13:20.850 --> 00:13:24.100
And there are several other kinds of clues that you're doing a historical

239
00:13:24.101 --> 00:13:26.230
reading rather than a theological reading or literary reading.

240
00:13:26.410 --> 00:13:31.150
And you'll pick up on those as we go through the class.
In fact,
in your sections,

241
00:13:31.151 --> 00:13:31.811
not this time,

242
00:13:31.811 --> 00:13:36.130
but next time you will actually talk about how to write an Exige Jesus paper

243
00:13:36.190 --> 00:13:39.850
because you'll be writing one and your section leaders will lead you through

244
00:13:39.970 --> 00:13:42.400
this method and try to get you to see how it's done.

245
00:13:44.380 --> 00:13:48.280
If we're going to do that though,
let's imagine what kind of community,

246
00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:51.550
this ancient guy,
we're going to call mark,
we're gonna continue to call him mark,

247
00:13:51.551 --> 00:13:54.430
even though we don't believe that it was the historical John Mark who wrote the

248
00:13:54.431 --> 00:13:57.580
Gospel.
But for convenience sake,
we just call him the Gospel Writers,
Matthew,

249
00:13:57.581 --> 00:14:00.960
Mark,
Luke,
and John for convenience sake.
So what kinds of,

250
00:14:00.961 --> 00:14:04.630
what did mark want to do with this text?
Who did he want to do it with?

251
00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:06.760
What kind of historical context do we imagine?

252
00:14:06.970 --> 00:14:11.410
And first we see immediately we see a bunch of problems with this text.

253
00:14:11.830 --> 00:14:15.640
There's first the problem when the most famous problems of the messianic secret.

254
00:14:16.780 --> 00:14:18.730
This is when over and over again mark,

255
00:14:18.731 --> 00:14:20.920
and it happens sometimes in the other gospels,
but it's,

256
00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:23.560
it happens more in mark than a lot of other places.

257
00:14:24.010 --> 00:14:29.010
You get Jesus doing something and then he tells somebody to be too quiet about

258
00:14:29.531 --> 00:14:30.364
what he's just done.

259
00:14:30.670 --> 00:14:35.470
Looking at one 25 mark one 25 he's just cast.

260
00:14:35.540 --> 00:14:39.880
He has,
he's confronted an unclean spirit.
The unclean spirit cried out.

261
00:14:40.030 --> 00:14:43.000
What have you to do with us?
Jesus of Nazareth have you come to destroy us?

262
00:14:43.001 --> 00:14:45.880
I know who you are,
the holy one of God.
In other words,

263
00:14:45.881 --> 00:14:50.200
the unclean spirit has just made a correct Christological confession according

264
00:14:50.201 --> 00:14:53.300
to the gospel of mark,
but Jesus rebuked him saying,

265
00:14:53.301 --> 00:14:56.600
be silent and come out of him and the unclean spirit convulsing and crying out

266
00:14:56.601 --> 00:14:57.590
with a loud voice came out of him.

267
00:14:58.100 --> 00:15:01.640
Look at one 34th Chapter 34 right below that.

268
00:15:02.510 --> 00:15:05.570
He cured many who are sick with various diseases and cast out many demons,

269
00:15:05.690 --> 00:15:09.980
but he would not permit the demons to speak because they knew him.

270
00:15:10.730 --> 00:15:11.563
Wait a minute.

271
00:15:11.780 --> 00:15:15.050
If Jesus is going around and we're supposed to think that he's announcing that

272
00:15:15.051 --> 00:15:18.560
he is the Messiah,
the Christ,
when people recognize this,

273
00:15:18.650 --> 00:15:22.100
why doesn't he let them speak?
Why does he tell them not to speak?

274
00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:24.050
And so he does this with demons a lot,

275
00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:27.800
but it's not just demons that he commands to silence.
He also does it to people.

276
00:15:27.801 --> 00:15:32.801
Look at one 43 [inaudible] immediately the leprosy left him this man.

277
00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:37.970
Let's try verse 42 and he was made clean after sternly warning him.

278
00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:41.270
He sent him away at once,
sang to him,
see that you say nothing to anyone,

279
00:15:41.271 --> 00:15:42.650
but go show yourself to the priest.

280
00:15:42.830 --> 00:15:46.370
Offer your cleansing what Moses commanded as a testimony to them.

281
00:15:46.580 --> 00:15:49.070
So it's a testimony to the fact that he's now no longer a leper,

282
00:15:49.220 --> 00:15:52.430
but he tells the men,
don't tell anybody about the miracle.

283
00:15:53.830 --> 00:15:54.520
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

284
00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:59.440
<v 0>Uh,
one,
five 53.
Now also notice what happens right below that in fort chip,</v>

285
00:15:59.441 --> 00:16:00.071
verse 45,

286
00:16:00.071 --> 00:16:03.760
but he went out to the man did and began to proclaim it freely and to spread the

287
00:16:03.761 --> 00:16:06.130
word so that Jesus could no longer go into a town openly,

288
00:16:06.280 --> 00:16:08.860
but stayed out in the country and people came to him from every quarter.

289
00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:13.060
So Jesus does some great act.
He tells the person,
the demon of the person,

290
00:16:13.061 --> 00:16:17.710
don't tell anybody.
The person goes out and tells people.
Anyway,
it's a pattern.

291
00:16:18.610 --> 00:16:23.350
So this is what we call the one of the old theories about the messianic secret

292
00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:27.040
was a modern scholar in the early 20th century said,
well,
here's what happened.

293
00:16:27.730 --> 00:16:29.590
The disciples of Jesus,
the say,
the Gospel,

294
00:16:29.591 --> 00:16:33.850
the writer of the gospel of mark knew that Jesus wasn't proclaimed openly and

295
00:16:33.851 --> 00:16:36.490
widely as the Messiah during Jesus's own lifetime.

296
00:16:36.940 --> 00:16:40.120
He was proclaimed as a messiah by Jesus,
the disciples after his death.

297
00:16:40.990 --> 00:16:44.590
So why didn't all these people recognize Jesus was the Messiah during his

298
00:16:44.591 --> 00:16:47.200
lifetime?
And so the scholar said,
well,

299
00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:50.000
the writer of the gospel of mark decided it must have been cut.

300
00:16:50.001 --> 00:16:52.780
Jesus kept it a secret.
Jesus wanted to keep it a secret.

301
00:16:53.500 --> 00:16:57.250
Now the problem with that theory is can you pick out the problem with that

302
00:16:57.251 --> 00:16:58.000
theory?

303
00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.480
The reason we have the messianic secret and mark is because people knew that

304
00:17:01.481 --> 00:17:04.270
Jesus was not openly proclaimed to the Messiah during his lifetime.

305
00:17:04.450 --> 00:17:08.680
So this was a literary device to explain why Jesus wasn't known as lifetime is

306
00:17:08.681 --> 00:17:12.520
because Jesus kept it a secret.
What's wrong with this theory?
Yes ma'am.

307
00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:14.093
<v 1>Yep.</v>

308
00:17:17.980 --> 00:17:22.120
<v 0>There's one place where he does say go tell the binding of the strong man other</v>

309
00:17:22.121 --> 00:17:22.954
problems with the theory

310
00:17:26.620 --> 00:17:27.610
the people tell anyway,

311
00:17:28.450 --> 00:17:31.600
so it doesn't explain that Jesus wasn't proclaimed in the PSI because all the

312
00:17:31.601 --> 00:17:34.090
people that tell us to be quiet go and proclaim him anyway.

313
00:17:34.270 --> 00:17:36.130
And it just says his fame spread.

314
00:17:36.910 --> 00:17:39.640
So there's been a lot of other theories about this whole messianic secret.

315
00:17:39.820 --> 00:17:42.130
What does it mean?
Why does he tell people to be quiet?

316
00:17:42.430 --> 00:17:45.520
What is it that he wants them to keep quiet and why did they go tell him,

317
00:17:45.580 --> 00:17:49.000
tell about him anyway,
what does that mean for the story?
That's the first,

318
00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:52.200
the second problem.
The problem of misunderstanding.

319
00:17:52.710 --> 00:17:54.720
Look at Mark Two 16

320
00:17:57.320 --> 00:18:01.530
uh,
when the scribes of the Pharisees saw that he was eating with sinners and tax

321
00:18:01.531 --> 00:18:03.810
collectors,
they said to his disciples,

322
00:18:03.811 --> 00:18:07.350
why does he eat with tax collectors and sinners?
When Jesus heard this,

323
00:18:07.351 --> 00:18:09.780
he said to them,
those who are well,
instead what I want to read,

324
00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:11.633
<v 2>okay,</v>

325
00:18:13.980 --> 00:18:14.813
<v 0>well,
okay,</v>

326
00:18:15.060 --> 00:18:18.930
look at 1534 I think I can make this point better with a couple of other texts.

327
00:18:20.340 --> 00:18:23.430
This point is that the point I'm making is that people tend to misunderstand

328
00:18:23.431 --> 00:18:27.600
Jesus,
his sayings and off often events.
At three o'clock,

329
00:18:27.601 --> 00:18:31.410
Jesus cried out with our loud voice.
This is when he's crucified.
Loi,
Loi,

330
00:18:31.411 --> 00:18:35.460
Lama Sabachthani,
which means it's Aramaic.
It means my God,
my God,

331
00:18:35.490 --> 00:18:39.300
why have you forsaken me?
When some of the bystanders heard it,
they said,
listen,

332
00:18:39.301 --> 00:18:42.900
he's calling for Elijah.
What does not count for Elijah?
It's just that the word,

333
00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:45.870
that Aramaic word,
Ella,
Ella is sounds like the name of Ligeia.

334
00:18:46.230 --> 00:18:50.640
So people standing around misunderstand things that are happening,
did it,

335
00:18:50.641 --> 00:18:53.580
but it's not just people standing around the disciples in mark,

336
00:18:53.581 --> 00:18:54.660
the disciples themselves,

337
00:18:54.661 --> 00:18:59.160
the people who are closest to Jesus are the ones who get it wrong the most.

338
00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:02.130
I hope you notice this when you were reading this text before class,

339
00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:07.020
is that repeatedly Jesus has to explain things to Peter and James and John,

340
00:19:07.021 --> 00:19:09.770
his closest disciples for 41 [inaudible].

341
00:19:11.810 --> 00:19:12.130
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

342
00:19:12.130 --> 00:19:15.460
<v 0>He said to them,
why are you afraid?
Have you still no faith?
In other words,</v>

343
00:19:15.461 --> 00:19:17.830
they've already seen him do all kinds of miracles by this point in mark,

344
00:19:18.820 --> 00:19:22.060
and they were filled with great Oland said to another who then is this that even

345
00:19:22.061 --> 00:19:24.790
the wind and the sea obey him?
Well,
where are the readers?
We're going?

346
00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:29.390
You learn to that.
And the first verse,
sign of God.
Hmm.

347
00:19:30.700 --> 00:19:33.550
All the way through here,
we've been just been telling people what he is,

348
00:19:33.551 --> 00:19:37.090
or at least demons have another people and people had been confessing and yet

349
00:19:37.091 --> 00:19:40.300
the disciples don't understand.
Uh,
six 52.

350
00:19:41.950 --> 00:19:45.250
Now notice my point about this is not to say that historically Jesus,

351
00:19:45.251 --> 00:19:49.180
his disciples actually didn't understand.
We're not looking for what happened.

352
00:19:49.420 --> 00:19:52.840
What we're looking for is the narrative structure.
What,
what store,

353
00:19:52.870 --> 00:19:57.280
what kind of story the author tells and why does he tell it this way?
Six 52,

354
00:20:00.190 --> 00:20:03.700
um,
start reading at say 51.
Then he got out of the boat.
This is when Jesus,

355
00:20:03.750 --> 00:20:06.930
you know,
doing another kind of see miracle.

356
00:20:07.230 --> 00:20:10.530
He got out into the boat with them and the wind ceased and they were utterly

357
00:20:10.531 --> 00:20:13.440
astounded.
Four,
they did not understand about the loaves,

358
00:20:13.441 --> 00:20:15.150
but their hearts were hardened.
In other words,

359
00:20:15.151 --> 00:20:17.880
Jews had multiplied loaves and fishes and a previous scene.

360
00:20:18.420 --> 00:20:21.000
They should have picked up on that,
that he somehow special

361
00:20:22.650 --> 00:20:26.490
somehow they didn't understand what special about Jesus.

362
00:20:26.850 --> 00:20:31.470
It goes all the way at seven,
18,
a eight,
six,
17 through 21 over and over again.

363
00:20:31.471 --> 00:20:32.940
Just if when you're studying mark,

364
00:20:32.941 --> 00:20:36.240
go through and mark the different times when somebody gets it wrong,

365
00:20:36.660 --> 00:20:38.880
even when they should not have gotten it wrong.

366
00:20:39.570 --> 00:20:41.190
There are people who recognize them.

367
00:20:42.270 --> 00:20:47.270
The first person who recognizes Jesus in the gospel of Mark is you because the

368
00:20:48.251 --> 00:20:53.251
very first verse announces the beginning of the good news you Angeli on in Greek

369
00:20:53.681 --> 00:20:57.400
meaning just good announcement,
good news of Jesus Christ,
the son of God.

370
00:20:57.820 --> 00:21:01.060
Now some manuscripts don't have that verse quite like that,

371
00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:04.480
but if that's the original wording of the of that verse,

372
00:21:04.570 --> 00:21:07.510
you have been told from the very first verse that Jesus is the Son of God.

373
00:21:07.970 --> 00:21:09.310
It's not a mystery to you,
the reader.

374
00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:13.510
That's part of the fun of the gospel of this.
Mark and John both play with this.

375
00:21:13.780 --> 00:21:18.070
They let you the reader in on certain kinds of jokes and puzzles that the people

376
00:21:18.071 --> 00:21:19.270
in the story don't get.

377
00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:22.600
So that's one of the things that mark is doing is letting you in on some things,

378
00:21:22.601 --> 00:21:26.440
but still it's very difficult for us to figure out this whole messianic secret

379
00:21:26.441 --> 00:21:27.820
thing and this lack of understanding.

380
00:21:27.850 --> 00:21:32.590
Even though we'd been on the secret and the last person to know who Jesus is and

381
00:21:32.591 --> 00:21:37.591
to recognize them and not to misunderstand is this interior at the cross in 1539

382
00:21:38.351 --> 00:21:42.370
the Roman centurion,
when Jesus dies says this,

383
00:21:42.371 --> 00:21:45.400
and now I'll do it the way the greatest story ever told the movie.

384
00:21:46.660 --> 00:21:49.120
This scene is played by John Wayne.

385
00:21:50.020 --> 00:21:53.440
He's the Roman Centurion and you don't really see John Wayne.

386
00:21:53.441 --> 00:21:57.100
Clearly you'd see a shadow with the sun coming in and Jesus just died on the

387
00:21:57.101 --> 00:22:02.060
cross.
And then you hear this over voice over voice.
Surely there's was us,

388
00:22:02.061 --> 00:22:06.490
son of God,
John Wayne,
invitation for you.

389
00:22:07.810 --> 00:22:11.530
So this material though recognizes that Jesus,
son of God,
at least the court,

390
00:22:11.560 --> 00:22:12.281
if that's the way we read,

391
00:22:12.281 --> 00:22:15.760
that the other people who recognize Jesus and understand our demons,

392
00:22:16.450 --> 00:22:20.350
at least they recognize him.
Now let's look at the turning point in the gospel.

393
00:22:20.351 --> 00:22:24.550
And what I'm going to do is show you how I,
as a brilliant modern scholar,

394
00:22:25.450 --> 00:22:28.450
has posed these problems.
The Messianic secret problem,

395
00:22:28.540 --> 00:22:31.060
the problem of misunderstanding and all this sort of thing.

396
00:22:31.061 --> 00:22:32.470
And now and the problem of the ending,

397
00:22:32.471 --> 00:22:34.960
which I'll get to in a minute and I'm going to make it all make sense for you.

398
00:22:35.410 --> 00:22:38.500
There are other scholars who might not think I'm so brilliant and might have

399
00:22:38.501 --> 00:22:41.140
other explanations,
but this one's mine and I'm sticking to it.

400
00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:42.880
[inaudible] eight 27

401
00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:47.590
follow along with me in your hymnals.

402
00:22:49.720 --> 00:22:54.710
Eight 27 Jesus went on with his disciples to the villages of Cesarea,

403
00:22:54.740 --> 00:22:59.410
Philippon and on the way he asks his disciples,
who do people say that I am?

404
00:22:59.470 --> 00:23:02.620
Okay,
nice little introduction.
You're a smart readers.

405
00:23:02.890 --> 00:23:05.140
As soon as you get to this part,
you go,
okay,

406
00:23:05.650 --> 00:23:09.370
we're getting to the climax of this book because all the way through the book,

407
00:23:09.371 --> 00:23:11.680
up to this point,
we've had this issue of who is he?

408
00:23:12.310 --> 00:23:16.100
Who Do people say is how do they understand him?
So you should your,

409
00:23:16.101 --> 00:23:19.420
your antenna should be picking up that this story is going to be an important

410
00:23:19.421 --> 00:23:22.960
story for you.
And they answered him,
John the Baptist and others,

411
00:23:22.961 --> 00:23:25.870
Elijah and still love this one of the prophets.
He asked them,

412
00:23:25.990 --> 00:23:29.680
but who do you say that I am?
Peter answered him,

413
00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:34.920
you are the Messiah and he sternly ordered them not to tell anyone about him.

414
00:23:36.700 --> 00:23:39.760
There it is again.
Peter confesses correctly,

415
00:23:39.870 --> 00:23:42.850
you are the Messiah and Jesus says,
okay,
don't tell anybody.

416
00:23:44.260 --> 00:23:46.370
[inaudible] is not very good evangelist.

417
00:23:46.371 --> 00:23:51.080
Apparently he's not Joel Ornstein or whoever that guy is in Houston.

418
00:23:51.560 --> 00:23:53.450
He's not the kind who is proclaiming it all out,

419
00:23:53.451 --> 00:23:57.650
at least according to the gospel of mark.
Then he began to teach them.

420
00:23:57.860 --> 00:24:01.280
Now wait a minute,
that might be important.
He just did this command to silence.

421
00:24:01.310 --> 00:24:03.770
What is the next verse say?

422
00:24:04.100 --> 00:24:08.330
Then he began to teach them that the son of man must undergo great suffering.

423
00:24:08.450 --> 00:24:10.220
Then he began to teach them.

424
00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:14.180
Then he began to teach them not before.

425
00:24:14.181 --> 00:24:18.350
Then he began to teach them that the son of man must undergo great suffering,

426
00:24:18.630 --> 00:24:19.850
be rejected by the elders,

427
00:24:19.851 --> 00:24:23.360
the chief priests and scribes and be killed and after three day rise again,

428
00:24:24.140 --> 00:24:26.870
he said all this quite openly.

429
00:24:28.010 --> 00:24:29.360
Mark is a clever writer.

430
00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:33.740
He puts little short sentences like this and his Gospel at interesting places

431
00:24:33.980 --> 00:24:37.250
and you are,
the reader is supposed to go,
okay,
he's talking right to me.

432
00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:41.330
He said this openly,
it's not closed anymore.

433
00:24:41.960 --> 00:24:43.730
This part's open.
This part's not closed,

434
00:24:45.170 --> 00:24:46.850
but it's not going to be the end of the problem.

435
00:24:46.910 --> 00:24:49.400
And Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him,

436
00:24:49.610 --> 00:24:51.320
but turning and looking at his disciples,

437
00:24:51.410 --> 00:24:55.820
he rebuked Peter Peter's course saying something like,
no,
no,
no,
no,
Jesus.

438
00:24:55.821 --> 00:24:58.670
You didn't get it.
We just said,
you're the messiah.

439
00:24:59.250 --> 00:25:01.550
The Messiah doesn't suffer and die on a cross.

440
00:25:01.551 --> 00:25:04.340
The Messiah comes with angels and rules the world,

441
00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:05.900
the Messiah overthrows the Romans,

442
00:25:06.050 --> 00:25:09.710
the messiah sets up the new reconstituted Israel and all the nations will flock

443
00:25:09.711 --> 00:25:12.710
to Jerusalem.
Now you're the messiah.
That's what you do.
No,
no,

444
00:25:12.711 --> 00:25:17.690
you don't suffer and die.
That's not what Messiah is due and this is actually,

445
00:25:17.691 --> 00:25:17.990
you know what?

446
00:25:17.990 --> 00:25:21.560
You know there's no Jewish expectation in the ancient world that the Messiah

447
00:25:21.561 --> 00:25:24.680
would suffer and die.
We Modern Christians think,

448
00:25:24.681 --> 00:25:26.420
well that's of course it's all the way through the Old Testament.

449
00:25:26.630 --> 00:25:28.610
But that those prophecies and things,

450
00:25:28.611 --> 00:25:30.230
those statements and poems in the Old Testament,

451
00:25:30.380 --> 00:25:33.320
they weren't taken to be about the messiah they were taking to be about other

452
00:25:33.321 --> 00:25:36.830
profits are holy men of God who might have to suffer,
who might be persecuted,

453
00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:41.120
but the messiah passages don't have suffering and death in them.

454
00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:44.750
They just refer to this coming king,
the descendant of David.

455
00:25:45.110 --> 00:25:47.570
So no Jews in this,
in the first century,

456
00:25:47.571 --> 00:25:50.480
this time expected that the Messiah would be crucified.

457
00:25:50.510 --> 00:25:53.150
It just was absolutely against common sense.

458
00:25:53.930 --> 00:25:57.800
You just cruise Messiahs don't suffer.
Messiahs aren't crucified.
Messiah is,

459
00:25:57.801 --> 00:26:00.530
aren't,
aren't beaten.
So Peter actually is quite,

460
00:26:02.060 --> 00:26:06.710
quite understandably,
thinks that Jesus has got it wrong.
So Peter says,

461
00:26:07.130 --> 00:26:10.010
you know,
you're the messiah.
You're not,
you're not going to be killed and suffer.

462
00:26:10.250 --> 00:26:14.750
And that's when Jesus turns around and rebukes Peter Looking at his disciples.

463
00:26:14.751 --> 00:26:15.301
Is that an interest?

464
00:26:15.301 --> 00:26:18.980
Include that Jesus is looking at his disciples and he rebukes Peter,

465
00:26:19.880 --> 00:26:22.250
get behind me,
Satan.

466
00:26:23.510 --> 00:26:26.990
For you are setting your mind not on divine things,
but on human things.

467
00:26:29.210 --> 00:26:32.630
So that's a very interesting story in itself.
What is Paul?

468
00:26:32.660 --> 00:26:36.290
What does Jesus rebuking Peter for and calling him Satan.

469
00:26:37.610 --> 00:26:40.400
He called the crowd with his disciples and said to them,

470
00:26:40.850 --> 00:26:44.730
if you want to become my followers,
let them.
If any wants to become my followers,

471
00:26:44.731 --> 00:26:49.050
let them deny themselves and take up their cross and follow me.

472
00:26:49.560 --> 00:26:53.580
For those who want to save their life will lose it for the sake of the Gospel.

473
00:26:54.330 --> 00:26:57.900
Um,
lose their life for my sake and for the sake of the Gospel will save it.

474
00:26:58.170 --> 00:27:01.440
But what would it profit them to gain the whole world and forfeit their life?

475
00:27:01.441 --> 00:27:05.190
Indeed.
What can,
what can they give in return for their life?

476
00:27:05.490 --> 00:27:08.700
Those who are ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful

477
00:27:08.701 --> 00:27:10.080
generation of them,

478
00:27:10.081 --> 00:27:13.680
the son of man will also be ashamed when he comes in the glory of his angels,

479
00:27:13.740 --> 00:27:15.660
of his father with the holy angels.

480
00:27:15.780 --> 00:27:19.560
That's what Messiah we're expected to do is come in glory with holy angels.

481
00:27:21.090 --> 00:27:22.080
And he said to them,
truly,

482
00:27:22.081 --> 00:27:26.610
I tell you there are some standing here who will not taste death until they see

483
00:27:26.611 --> 00:27:30.210
that kingdom of God has come with power.
What's going on here?

484
00:27:31.740 --> 00:27:33.990
You have the correct identification of Jesus.

485
00:27:34.470 --> 00:27:38.400
Even according to mark as the Messiah.
You have the charge to secrecy.

486
00:27:38.730 --> 00:27:41.400
In eight 30 you had the passion,
prediction,

487
00:27:42.140 --> 00:27:44.820
one of the passion predictions of the first of several that we'll see in mark

488
00:27:44.910 --> 00:27:46.530
Jesus saying,
this is going to happen,

489
00:27:47.160 --> 00:27:51.360
and then you hit this word and he said this plainly and clearly to them and I

490
00:27:51.361 --> 00:27:54.240
said,
no clue.
Then you have Peter's misunderstanding,

491
00:27:54.241 --> 00:27:57.780
but what does Peter Misunderstand?
That's what we'll ask.

492
00:27:58.800 --> 00:28:01.380
What was it Peter expecting different while he was expecting the Messiah to come

493
00:28:01.381 --> 00:28:02.670
with angels and triumphant.

494
00:28:03.240 --> 00:28:06.450
Then you have an emphasis on suffering that everybody has to suffer.

495
00:28:06.451 --> 00:28:07.261
Not just a son of man,

496
00:28:07.261 --> 00:28:12.090
but everybody has to suffer and you have a prediction of future eschatological

497
00:28:12.120 --> 00:28:16.860
glory.
Eschatology is just a fancy theological word,
meaning the end times,

498
00:28:16.861 --> 00:28:20.940
the study of the end times as cotton is just a Greek word,

499
00:28:20.941 --> 00:28:22.020
meaning the end.

500
00:28:25.240 --> 00:28:26.010
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

501
00:28:26.010 --> 00:28:30.870
<v 0>You'll see this.
If you read much about the new,
the Bible or ancient religion,</v>

502
00:28:31.320 --> 00:28:36.320
the eschaton will come up in apocalyptic context and eschatology means any study

503
00:28:36.361 --> 00:28:40.680
or doctrine about the end of the world as we know it.
In fact,

504
00:28:40.681 --> 00:28:43.320
I used to direct a little singing group and the divinity school when I was a

505
00:28:43.350 --> 00:28:45.710
Grad student here and we called ourselves the ESCA tones,

506
00:28:47.640 --> 00:28:49.740
a joke that only divinity students would get.

507
00:28:53.130 --> 00:28:57.360
So the the prediction of the eschatological glory that comes after the suffering

508
00:28:57.900 --> 00:29:02.700
and then right after that,
six to six days later,
Jesus took with him,

509
00:29:02.701 --> 00:29:06.780
Peter and James and John led them up to a high mountain apart by themselves and

510
00:29:06.781 --> 00:29:10.440
he was transfigured before them and his clothes became dazzling white such as no

511
00:29:10.441 --> 00:29:12.510
one on earth could bleach them and they appeared to them.

512
00:29:12.511 --> 00:29:16.350
Elijah with Moses and Elijah with Moses who we're talking with Jesus.

513
00:29:16.530 --> 00:29:20.010
Peter says to Jesus,
rabbi,
it's good for us to be here.

514
00:29:20.040 --> 00:29:24.540
Let us make three dwellings,
three tabernacles,
three tents,
one for you,

515
00:29:24.541 --> 00:29:26.100
one for Moses and one for Elijah.

516
00:29:26.370 --> 00:29:28.440
He did not know what to say for they were terrified.

517
00:29:28.710 --> 00:29:31.290
Then a cloud overshadowed them and from the cloud there came a voice.

518
00:29:31.291 --> 00:29:35.790
This is my son,
the beloved,
listen to him.
Suddenly when they looked around,

519
00:29:35.820 --> 00:29:39.870
they saw no one with him anymore,
but only Jesus.
The next verse,

520
00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:42.320
and they were coming down the mountain as argument.

521
00:29:42.370 --> 00:29:45.250
He ordered them to tell no one what they had seen.
Again,

522
00:29:45.251 --> 00:29:50.251
that secrecy motif until the son of man had risen from the dead and again and

523
00:29:50.520 --> 00:29:53.560
it's just on death.
What's going on with all this?

524
00:29:53.830 --> 00:29:57.730
What's going on is that mark is trying to make an important point maybe even to

525
00:29:57.731 --> 00:30:00.850
his fellow believers at the time.
Apparently

526
00:30:04.030 --> 00:30:09.030
Mark's basically what peer doesn't understand about Jesus is that Jesus has to

527
00:30:09.161 --> 00:30:14.140
suffer and has to die and if that causes a redefinition of Peter's notion of

528
00:30:14.141 --> 00:30:15.940
what a messiah is,
so be it.

529
00:30:16.630 --> 00:30:21.220
Peter needs to work with a redefined notion of the Christ,
the Messiah,

530
00:30:21.460 --> 00:30:25.420
if he doesn't include the necessity of suffering in that notion.

531
00:30:26.290 --> 00:30:29.500
Let's look,
let's imagine the context for this kind of message.

532
00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:34.780
The rapid fire style of mark is one of the,
if you noticed,

533
00:30:34.810 --> 00:30:37.690
did you notice how many times immediately is used the word immediately,

534
00:30:38.080 --> 00:30:38.810
the writer of the Gospel,

535
00:30:38.810 --> 00:30:43.300
Martin needed a good Yale college editor or a writing tutor because it's kind of

536
00:30:43.301 --> 00:30:47.180
a rapid fire is not written very good Greek style either is rapid fire exists

537
00:30:47.181 --> 00:30:47.590
immediately.

538
00:30:47.590 --> 00:30:49.360
This happened then immediately this happened in the meeting and said,

539
00:30:49.480 --> 00:30:53.800
you get the idea reading Guzman mark,
that the narrative is,
is pulling you along,

540
00:30:53.801 --> 00:30:58.330
is shoving you along as is rushing you along.
That's actually part of,
I think,

541
00:30:58.331 --> 00:31:02.470
this apocalyptic style of Mark Because the gospel of mark is also apocalyptic in

542
00:31:02.471 --> 00:31:04.870
its message.
It talks about angels coming at the end.

543
00:31:04.871 --> 00:31:07.570
It talks about a big war that's going to happen,

544
00:31:07.990 --> 00:31:11.200
so you have demons and the battle of Jesus with the strong man.

545
00:31:11.230 --> 00:31:12.670
Another apocalyptic story.

546
00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:17.140
You have the emphasis on suffering and persecution and that's a common theme of

547
00:31:17.141 --> 00:31:19.690
Jewish apocalyptic.
Not that the Messiah would suffer,

548
00:31:19.900 --> 00:31:24.190
but that the Jews themselves might have to suffer before the fabulous kingdom of

549
00:31:24.191 --> 00:31:28.090
the end time.
Remember you saw it in Daniel.
When we read Daniel Two classes ago,

550
00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:32.350
Daniel predicts suffering for the righteous and only after the suffering would

551
00:31:32.351 --> 00:31:34.990
you have the goodies heaven,
the Kingdom of God.

552
00:31:35.530 --> 00:31:40.180
Now we look at mark 13 we're going to analyze it pretty carefully because again,

553
00:31:40.181 --> 00:31:41.350
some of these things will come into play.

554
00:31:42.790 --> 00:31:47.410
The basic message I'm saying is that people misunderstand about Jesus is they

555
00:31:47.411 --> 00:31:51.400
misunderstand the necessity of suffering that must be there before you.

556
00:31:51.610 --> 00:31:55.270
It must precede glory.
Yes,
God promises them glory.

557
00:31:55.390 --> 00:31:58.090
They're going to be glorified in the end.
They're gonna win in the end,

558
00:31:58.870 --> 00:32:01.690
but they have to go through a period of suffering.

559
00:32:02.020 --> 00:32:04.090
Jesus is the first one who does this.

560
00:32:04.240 --> 00:32:08.560
He accepts suffering and death before he himself is glorified,

561
00:32:08.590 --> 00:32:11.200
but the glory will come.
It has to be preceded by suffering,

562
00:32:11.410 --> 00:32:13.720
but Jesus also in mark tells the disciples over and over again,

563
00:32:13.840 --> 00:32:17.980
you also will have to suffer first,
but if you endure,

564
00:32:18.040 --> 00:32:22.180
you will experience glory.
Also Nicola Mark 13

565
00:32:24.880 --> 00:32:28.810
as he came out of the temple,
one of his disciples said to him,
look,
teacher,

566
00:32:28.811 --> 00:32:32.470
what large stones and what large buildings,
and Jesus asked him,

567
00:32:32.620 --> 00:32:36.970
do you see these great buildings?
Not One stone will be left here upon another.

568
00:32:37.150 --> 00:32:38.350
All will be thrown down.

569
00:32:38.740 --> 00:32:43.190
So he's predicting the destruction of the temple in Jerusalem when he was

570
00:32:43.191 --> 00:32:46.550
sitting on the Mount of Olives opposite the temple,
Peter,
James,
John,

571
00:32:46.551 --> 00:32:48.110
and Andrew asked him privately,

572
00:32:48.590 --> 00:32:52.370
tell us when will this be and what will be the sign that all these things are to

573
00:32:52.371 --> 00:32:54.980
be accomplished.
Then Jesus began to say them,

574
00:32:55.250 --> 00:32:58.610
but where that no one leads you astray.
Many will come in my name and say,

575
00:32:58.611 --> 00:33:00.710
I am he and they will lead me astray.

576
00:33:01.070 --> 00:33:04.490
So false prophets do you just predict there'll be false profits,

577
00:33:04.491 --> 00:33:08.480
maybe even false messiahs although he doesn't use that term here in mark it

578
00:33:08.990 --> 00:33:10.130
there will occur in other places.

579
00:33:10.790 --> 00:33:15.680
When you hear of wars and rumors of wars do not be alarmed.
This must take place,

580
00:33:15.920 --> 00:33:19.810
but the end is still to come.
So just when people have the,
when times are bad in,

581
00:33:19.811 --> 00:33:21.980
there are wars,
that's not necessarily the end yet.

582
00:33:22.370 --> 00:33:25.250
You've got to have few of those for nation will rise against nation,

583
00:33:25.251 --> 00:33:28.190
kingdom against kingdom.
There will be earthquakes in various places,
famines,

584
00:33:28.520 --> 00:33:32.840
but it is the but the beginning of the birth pangs as for yourself,

585
00:33:32.870 --> 00:33:34.710
beware for,
they will hand you over to the councils.

586
00:33:34.711 --> 00:33:37.070
You will be beaten in synagogues again,
this theme of suffering.

587
00:33:37.340 --> 00:33:41.240
So you have all these terrible cosmic events,
terrible wars and disasters,

588
00:33:41.270 --> 00:33:42.560
earthquakes and all that sort of thing.

589
00:33:42.680 --> 00:33:45.110
But also he says you're going to have to suffer.

590
00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:50.200
They're going to hand you over for persecution in 1310 and the good news must

591
00:33:52.911 --> 00:33:54.650
first be proclaimed to all nations.

592
00:33:54.860 --> 00:33:58.220
So Jesus is predicting that before the incomes,
his message,

593
00:33:58.250 --> 00:34:01.130
the Gospel message will be proclaimed all around.

594
00:34:01.550 --> 00:34:03.800
And even though you have worse things happening,

595
00:34:03.860 --> 00:34:07.090
1312 brother will betray brother to death of father,
his child,

596
00:34:07.120 --> 00:34:10.640
child and children will rise against parents and have them put to death and you

597
00:34:10.641 --> 00:34:12.260
will be hated by all because of my name,

598
00:34:12.290 --> 00:34:16.430
but the one who endures to the end will be saved.
In other words,

599
00:34:16.431 --> 00:34:17.690
familial divisions,

600
00:34:17.720 --> 00:34:22.430
even the households will be torn apart by the suffering,
by the conflict,

601
00:34:23.360 --> 00:34:28.360
and then 1314 but when you see the desolating sacrilege set up where it ought

602
00:34:29.601 --> 00:34:32.000
not to be.
Now here's one of those little phrases.

603
00:34:32.150 --> 00:34:36.830
Let the reader understand.
The author is giving you a very,

604
00:34:36.831 --> 00:34:40.280
very clear clue that this is when you really better be paying attention.

605
00:34:41.420 --> 00:34:45.650
Let the reader understand when you see the desolating sacrilege set up where it

606
00:34:45.651 --> 00:34:47.690
ought not to be.
Have we heard that before?

607
00:34:47.840 --> 00:34:51.050
The abomination of desolation is that King James,
English,

608
00:34:51.170 --> 00:34:52.340
English translation of it.

609
00:34:52.720 --> 00:34:55.840
The desolating sacrilege is often when it's translated in more modern bibles at

610
00:34:55.841 --> 00:34:57.050
our first,
at the same language,

611
00:34:57.560 --> 00:35:01.400
wherever we heard about the abomination of desolation being set up where it

612
00:35:01.401 --> 00:35:04.250
ought not to be set up before Daniel.

613
00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:09.290
The words come right out of Daniel.
They occur three of course,

614
00:35:09.291 --> 00:35:12.260
Daniel was written in a combination of Hebrew and Aramaic,
and this is in Greek,

615
00:35:12.530 --> 00:35:16.310
but this is the Greek translation.
You have it in Daniel nine 27.

616
00:35:16.580 --> 00:35:19.760
Daniel 1131 and Daniel 1211.

617
00:35:19.790 --> 00:35:21.800
So this Jesus has read his Daniel

618
00:35:23.550 --> 00:35:28.490
and then you have warnings in row woes,
uh,
verses 15 through 13.

619
00:35:29.480 --> 00:35:32.690
So you have all this stuff,
but now what happens after that?

620
00:35:33.800 --> 00:35:34.760
The one who in the house got,

621
00:35:34.761 --> 00:35:36.680
must not go down to into the house to take anything away.

622
00:35:36.860 --> 00:35:38.700
The one in the field must not turn back to the coat.

623
00:35:38.850 --> 00:35:41.430
Woe to those who are pregnant to those who are nursing infants in those days,

624
00:35:41.610 --> 00:35:43.770
pray that it may not be in winter for in those days,

625
00:35:43.771 --> 00:35:46.500
there will be suffering such as not even from the beginning of creation that God

626
00:35:46.780 --> 00:35:49.110
and never will be.
And if the Lord had not cut short those days,

627
00:35:49.380 --> 00:35:50.250
no one will be saved.

628
00:35:50.310 --> 00:35:53.820
Now notice we're not getting any more historical events here.

629
00:35:54.300 --> 00:35:56.970
We're not getting any more stuff happening except right then he says,

630
00:35:57.150 --> 00:35:59.760
if anyone says to you,
look,
here's the Messiah,
or look,
there he is.

631
00:35:59.761 --> 00:36:01.650
Do not believe it.
False Messiah is false profits,

632
00:36:01.651 --> 00:36:02.830
so this is more false besides him,

633
00:36:02.831 --> 00:36:05.640
all false profits in those days after that suffering.

634
00:36:05.700 --> 00:36:09.060
Now here's where you really get the cataclysmic end.
The world crashing down.

635
00:36:09.240 --> 00:36:11.730
The Sun will be darkened.
The moon will not give it's light.

636
00:36:11.790 --> 00:36:15.420
Stars will fall from the skies.
The powers in the heavens will be shaken.

637
00:36:15.630 --> 00:36:20.630
Then you will see the son of man coming in clouds with great glory and power.

638
00:36:21.540 --> 00:36:24.870
Then he will send out the angels and gather his elect from the four winds,

639
00:36:24.871 --> 00:36:29.220
from the ends of the Earth to the ends of Heaven.
When does it happen?

640
00:36:29.730 --> 00:36:34.590
Right after the abomination of desolation is set up where it ought not to be.

641
00:36:34.980 --> 00:36:39.420
What is the abomination of desolation?
Well,
we don't know some.

642
00:36:39.630 --> 00:36:42.660
Obviously if Jesus is reading Daniel,
and this is where getting this,

643
00:36:43.020 --> 00:36:45.780
he also believes that something's going to happen in the temple.

644
00:36:46.620 --> 00:36:49.890
That author Daniel believed it was something that Antioch is the for the

645
00:36:49.900 --> 00:36:50.400
Epiphany's.

646
00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:54.240
May Be sacrificed a pig on the altar or he desecrated somehow the altar in the

647
00:36:54.241 --> 00:36:56.670
holy of holies in the temple.
Jesus says,

648
00:36:56.700 --> 00:36:59.940
doesn't believe that that event was the end event is Daniel thought it was.

649
00:37:00.120 --> 00:37:02.580
Jesus is predicting that this is going to happen.

650
00:37:02.581 --> 00:37:03.900
Something's going to happen in the temple.

651
00:37:03.990 --> 00:37:07.530
There's going to be so awful and it's going to be an abomination.

652
00:37:08.100 --> 00:37:11.100
And once that happens,
then all hell breaks loose.

653
00:37:11.370 --> 00:37:13.440
And when all hell has broken loose the worst,

654
00:37:13.560 --> 00:37:17.910
then the son of man will swoop down with in the clouds with angels and put a

655
00:37:17.911 --> 00:37:20.280
stop to it all.
That'll be the glorification.

656
00:37:21.360 --> 00:37:22.160
<v 1>Okay,</v>

657
00:37:22.160 --> 00:37:25.910
<v 0>so when does this happen?
Well,
mark has told us one thing.</v>

658
00:37:26.120 --> 00:37:29.120
It's going to happen during your own generation.
Jesus said,

659
00:37:29.180 --> 00:37:31.760
this generation will not pass away before this stuff happens.

660
00:37:32.180 --> 00:37:35.780
The apostles asked him,
so he said,
well,
it will be within a generation.

661
00:37:36.170 --> 00:37:37.940
And then he says,
now nobody's going to know the exact time,

662
00:37:37.941 --> 00:37:41.130
but once you see the abomination of desolation set up and the temple word all

663
00:37:41.131 --> 00:37:44.510
got to be,
that's when it's going to happen.
Now,
did this happen?

664
00:37:46.250 --> 00:37:48.530
Well,
we're not,
we're not narrated anything about it.

665
00:37:49.100 --> 00:37:49.933
<v 1>Okay.</v>

666
00:37:50.940 --> 00:37:54.480
<v 0>What does mark not narrate in this section?</v>

667
00:37:55.110 --> 00:37:59.340
That we as historians know happened with the temple?

668
00:38:01.560 --> 00:38:02.393
<v 1>What?</v>

669
00:38:03.580 --> 00:38:07.690
<v 0>What does he do?
What does he not narrate?
Happening is destruction.</v>

670
00:38:08.200 --> 00:38:12.370
Jesus predicts the destruction.
Jesus prophesies about destruction,

671
00:38:13.060 --> 00:38:16.750
but mark doesn't tell us that the temple in Jerusalem are destroyed.

672
00:38:17.230 --> 00:38:22.230
He doesn't tell us explicitly about the Roman armies led by Vespasian and Titus

673
00:38:23.200 --> 00:38:26.170
surrounding Jerusalem and seat besieging it for two years.

674
00:38:26.770 --> 00:38:31.770
He doesn't tell us that in the year 70 the Romans actually did take Jerusalem

675
00:38:32.980 --> 00:38:36.610
and burned the temple,
destroyed the temple.
If mark knew about that,

676
00:38:36.611 --> 00:38:39.340
why didn't he tell us about it?
This is why scholars,

677
00:38:39.430 --> 00:38:42.700
a lot of scholars believe this is exactly like Daniel.
Remember how we said,

678
00:38:42.790 --> 00:38:46.780
how do you date Daniel?
You figure out when does his,
his,
his,
his,

679
00:38:46.781 --> 00:38:50.920
his history gone,
right and when does his sister not go ride anymore?

680
00:38:51.490 --> 00:38:55.270
And if you applied that same standard of tests to this text,

681
00:38:55.510 --> 00:38:58.120
what you've got is a prediction of the temple destruction.

682
00:38:58.180 --> 00:39:01.390
So at least the rider knows that it is likely to happen.

683
00:39:01.870 --> 00:39:05.500
He can see it happening in the future,
but he doesn't narrate it.
Hackman.
Yes sir.

684
00:39:06.160 --> 00:39:06.993
<v 1>Wow.</v>

685
00:39:13.180 --> 00:39:15.220
<v 0>Yes.
Conservatives,</v>

686
00:39:16.120 --> 00:39:21.120
conservative Christians know that more than one generation has happened since

687
00:39:23.201 --> 00:39:26.310
that time.
Many,
many,
many generations.
They've taken the,

688
00:39:26.370 --> 00:39:28.540
the Greek word translated here as generation,

689
00:39:28.541 --> 00:39:32.560
which I think is the right translation and they say,
well,
if you,
you know,

690
00:39:32.590 --> 00:39:35.590
you can take that to mean race of people and of course,

691
00:39:35.591 --> 00:39:37.240
what race would they then be referring to?

692
00:39:37.390 --> 00:39:42.130
The Jews and so conservative Christians who don't believe who believe this has

693
00:39:42.131 --> 00:39:44.500
to be an accurate prediction of something that's going to happen in our future.

694
00:39:44.501 --> 00:39:48.910
Also translate that as race or say the generation doesn't refer to a generation

695
00:39:48.911 --> 00:39:52.480
of time of 40 years or so.
It means the race of the Jews,

696
00:39:52.930 --> 00:39:55.030
as long as there are Jews in existence,

697
00:39:55.300 --> 00:39:57.700
then this thing can still go on and hasn't happened yet.

698
00:39:58.150 --> 00:40:00.790
So that explains the translation.
Quite frankly,

699
00:40:00.940 --> 00:40:05.300
I think the translation is just wrong
because it seems to me that the,

700
00:40:05.380 --> 00:40:08.730
that what Mark's intention is to put some kind of time limit on this.

701
00:40:08.731 --> 00:40:11.250
He's trying to get his readers to see a time.
Well,

702
00:40:11.251 --> 00:40:12.750
if you just say the race of the Jews,

703
00:40:12.810 --> 00:40:16.350
then that doesn't give you any sense of time.
You have a question?

704
00:40:18.300 --> 00:40:19.920
Okay,
so where are we now?

705
00:40:22.890 --> 00:40:24.930
I think what's going on is this.
Let's just think of,

706
00:40:24.931 --> 00:40:29.040
imagine this happening 16 one through eight I've already read.

707
00:40:29.520 --> 00:40:33.450
And what happens in 61 through eight the women are told that Jesus has been

708
00:40:33.451 --> 00:40:35.400
raised from the dead as Jesus predicted he would be.

709
00:40:36.270 --> 00:40:39.150
And [inaudible] the young man tells the woman,

710
00:40:39.180 --> 00:40:42.810
go tell his disciples that he will go before the into Galilee.

711
00:40:42.840 --> 00:40:43.890
Go meet him in Galilee.

712
00:40:44.520 --> 00:40:47.610
And in fact earlier in mark in one of these sort of passion predictions,

713
00:40:47.850 --> 00:40:52.850
Jesus had told the disciples once I'm dead and I will go before you to Galilee,

714
00:40:54.120 --> 00:40:57.900
implying that they're supposed to follow him to Galilee.
But then 16 eight ends,

715
00:40:58.830 --> 00:41:00.330
one possible reconstruction for all this.

716
00:41:00.331 --> 00:41:04.050
And this is just an interpretation put out by some scholars excepted by some

717
00:41:04.200 --> 00:41:05.520
rejected by a whole lot of others.

718
00:41:06.120 --> 00:41:11.120
What if mark himself is writing right before the year 70 he knows he maybe he's

719
00:41:12.391 --> 00:41:16.800
even riding in Galilee himself or in some place close to Galilee and he knows

720
00:41:16.830 --> 00:41:21.300
the Romans army went through Galilee first in the year is 66 and 68 and

721
00:41:21.301 --> 00:41:22.830
destroyed lots of stuff and they,

722
00:41:22.831 --> 00:41:27.831
they won their battles against the Jews in Galilee first and they run through

723
00:41:27.901 --> 00:41:29.520
Galilee on the way to Jerusalem.

724
00:41:29.700 --> 00:41:33.530
They get to Jerusalem around 68 and for two years they're besieging the city of

725
00:41:33.531 --> 00:41:34.280
Jerusalem.

726
00:41:34.280 --> 00:41:38.420
What if mark has written right at that time before Jerusalem had had been taken

727
00:41:38.690 --> 00:41:42.710
before the temple had actually been destroyed because he has Jesus predict,

728
00:41:42.711 --> 00:41:45.560
like Daniel prayed in some abomination of desolation happening in the temple,

729
00:41:45.680 --> 00:41:46.820
but we don't know of anything like that.

730
00:41:46.820 --> 00:41:48.620
Really that happened is a historical event,
right?

731
00:41:48.621 --> 00:41:51.830
Then the temple was simply destroyed by the Romans.

732
00:41:52.460 --> 00:41:54.110
They didn't as far as we might think,

733
00:41:54.111 --> 00:41:56.900
well maybe he thinks that they're going to set up a Roman standard there or do

734
00:41:56.901 --> 00:42:00.350
something,
but we're not narrated what actually happened,
what,

735
00:42:00.351 --> 00:42:04.460
but so this and this scenario,
Mark writes his gospel with this message.

736
00:42:05.300 --> 00:42:10.300
Things are going to get a lot worse before they get better and just like they

737
00:42:10.671 --> 00:42:13.160
got a lot worse for Jesus before they got better,

738
00:42:13.490 --> 00:42:17.030
they're going to get a lot worse for us before they get better.

739
00:42:17.870 --> 00:42:21.920
And you need to be prepared because if you think that the Romans are gonna win

740
00:42:22.760 --> 00:42:24.500
and we're all going to be carried off into slavery,

741
00:42:25.070 --> 00:42:28.250
you don't have the right faith.
Jesus told us this,

742
00:42:28.430 --> 00:42:30.830
Jesus told us it wouldn't be all pine,
the sky by and by.

743
00:42:30.830 --> 00:42:31.970
It wouldn't be all good stuff.

744
00:42:32.570 --> 00:42:34.460
We're going to have to suffer just like he suffered.

745
00:42:34.820 --> 00:42:39.820
And he writes this Gospel message that over and over again has Jesus saying,

746
00:42:40.190 --> 00:42:45.050
suffering must precede glory.
Suffering must precede glory.

747
00:42:45.590 --> 00:42:49.220
Even as Jesus predict around the time when all this will happen.

748
00:42:49.400 --> 00:42:51.630
When you see Jerusalem says,
you know,

749
00:42:51.770 --> 00:42:54.350
with Jerusalem is surrounded by Roman armies who were pagans,

750
00:42:54.680 --> 00:42:56.780
you can pretty well guess that something's gonna happen.

751
00:42:58.190 --> 00:43:02.600
So I believe that the gospel of Mark May have been written right before 70 all

752
00:43:02.601 --> 00:43:07.070
right around 70 but the destruction of the temple has not sunk into

753
00:43:07.071 --> 00:43:08.690
consciousness yet or is not known to happen.

754
00:43:09.260 --> 00:43:13.040
And maybe even mark himself and his disciples are themselves in Galilee.

755
00:43:13.580 --> 00:43:17.480
Maybe this is why he says we're supposed to be in Galilee waiting for Jesus,

756
00:43:17.870 --> 00:43:20.740
and then he will appear to us when all is worse,

757
00:43:20.810 --> 00:43:24.710
when it just seems like everything's couldn't get worse.
I tr,
I tell you,

758
00:43:24.711 --> 00:43:29.390
he's gonna come in on the clouds and he'll destroy the Romans and he'll set up

759
00:43:29.391 --> 00:43:32.000
the Kingdom of God.
If he's doing this,

760
00:43:32.001 --> 00:43:35.810
it makes a lot of sense for the document also ending where it ends,
it says,

761
00:43:36.410 --> 00:43:38.510
tell them to go to Galilee and weight.

762
00:43:39.600 --> 00:43:40.080
<v 2>Okay.</v>

763
00:43:40.080 --> 00:43:44.160
<v 0>And Jesus goes to Galilee to meet them in a sense marks telling his readers,</v>

764
00:43:44.430 --> 00:43:47.700
all we have to do is stay here and he'll come for us.

765
00:43:49.460 --> 00:43:50.293
<v 2>Okay.</v>

766
00:43:50.330 --> 00:43:54.560
<v 0>That's one historical reading of the gospel of mark that plates,</v>

767
00:43:54.561 --> 00:43:57.860
it places it and one not provable time.

768
00:43:57.980 --> 00:43:59.930
Some scholars believe mark was written in Rome.

769
00:44:00.920 --> 00:44:04.700
Some people believe it was written after 70 I would say if mark was written

770
00:44:04.701 --> 00:44:08.810
after 70 very long after 70 I would clearly expect him to narrate the

771
00:44:08.811 --> 00:44:13.160
destruction of Jerusalem and the destruction of the temple as Luke does.

772
00:44:13.760 --> 00:44:16.610
When you read Luke,
who used mark is one of his sources.

773
00:44:16.820 --> 00:44:20.630
You'll notice that the writer of the gospel of Luke uses this passage out of

774
00:44:20.631 --> 00:44:25.631
mark and he edits it to add in the destruction of the temple before Jesus comes

775
00:44:28.011 --> 00:44:29.750
back.
The reason,

776
00:44:29.990 --> 00:44:32.390
because the writer of Luke knew that the temple had been destroyed.

777
00:44:32.960 --> 00:44:35.060
Why does it Mark Keller about it?
Because he doesn't know yet.

778
00:44:35.061 --> 00:44:35.780
That has been destroyed.
