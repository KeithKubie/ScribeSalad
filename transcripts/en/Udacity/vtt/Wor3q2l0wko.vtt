00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:03.040
Now this is something you should be proud of.

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:07.105
It's hard to learn JavaScript, but it's even harder to learn it well.

00:00:07.105 --> 00:00:10.690
Now you may still feel a little bit shaky around implementing things like this,

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:12.570
but that's completely normal.

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.910
So, I'm going to give you a few other ideas on how to

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:17.900
change your todo application.

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:21.910
Because although it's cliche' to say, practice does make perfect.

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:25.530
Here's some things that you can add to the todo application.

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:29.540
Let the user set the priority status when their creating the todo item.

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:33.740
Let users filter or sort by that same priority status.

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:37.270
Expand the priority status feature to have more than two levels.

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:40.410
Right now it's either priority or not priority.

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.600
What if there were different levels of priority?

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.340
Priority one, two and three?

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:49.140
What about adding a recycle bin for recovering deleted todos.

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.260
You could add colors, so that way people using your

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.850
application can associate different todos with each other by using colors.

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.430
You could add a whole labeling system for sorting and filtering.

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:02.850
And those are only the ideas that I came up with,

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.060
there are tons more things that you can do with this particular application.

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:09.300
Some of these are fairly trivial to implement, and

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.500
some of them are quite a bit more work.

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:12.710
And here's the best part,

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:18.030
if you make any of these changes or any others, they'll be your changes.

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.240
You will also be making whatever CSS changes are necessary, and

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.930
that is exciting.

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:27.770
You're finally at the point where you can do this stuff completely on your own.

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:31.160
So here's my challenge to you, try it.

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:34.440
If you're feeling hesitation or trepidation, go ahead and

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:38.750
change your attitude from, oh, I don't know if I can do that.

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:41.950
To, I know I can do that, my self.

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:45.900
It might just take me a little bit of time, or I might need to do some research.

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:49.990
And that right there, that change is the hardest part.

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:53.910
It's changing your mind, you're not grappling with the code, or

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:55.330
the technical problem.

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:57.350
You're grappling with yourself.

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:02.500
So, take your hesitation, throw it out the window, and do it.

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:03.910
Start on the project.

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:05.310
Start solving the problem.

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.060
Now here are two things that have worked for

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.500
me that I would like to share with you.

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.340
The first is to be a detective.

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.420
Remember that in the world of computer programming there is no magic at all.

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.220
So any code that you have and

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:22.030
any problems that you have, are discoverable and understandable.

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.180
You can go in and you can change things.

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.090
You can change the way they work, and you can fix them.

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.800
So remember that, there's no magic.

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:34.220
The second thing is, I'd like you to write code everyday.

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:36.010
That's a challenge.

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:38.669
John Resig, the original author of jQuery wrote,

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:45.320
the feeling of making progress is just as important as making actual progress.

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:49.870
So, I'd like you to add this to your calendar, every single day

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:54.200
make yourself a notification, or a reminder, to write some code.

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:55.510
So congratulations.

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:57.970
You've made it through this course.

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:59.630
But don't let it stop here.

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:03.060
Keep the momentum up, keep building things and reading, and

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:04.910
learning, and exploring.

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:08.470
And as you build cool things, go ahead and share them on the Udacity Forum,

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:11.990
because it's always good for other students to see what you've been building,

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:13.540
for you to see what they've been building,

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:15.970
and we always love seeing what you guys built.

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:19.450
Keep it up, good work, and have fun.

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:21.880
We'll see you later.
