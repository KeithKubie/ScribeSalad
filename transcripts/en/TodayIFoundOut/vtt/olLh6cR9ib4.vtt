00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:09.010
In the spring of 2005 during their mating
season, toads in Germany and Denmark began

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:10.530
exploding.

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.720
Spewing guts, blood and skin for nearly a
yard in every direction; the disturbing phenomenon

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:18.551
at first baffled concerned scientists, although
they eventually discovered the cause of the

00:00:18.551 --> 00:00:19.720
fatal condition.

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:24.660
Observed near two ponds during that spring,
one in the Altona district of Hamburg, Germany,

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.640
and the other near Laasby in Jutland, Denmark,
some of the explosions were actually witnessed

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.180
by environmental scientists.

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:35.140
First, they began with “several minutes”
of “agonizing and twitching” followed

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:39.300
by the toads blowing up like a balloon, and
then culminating in an explosion.

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.800
As the environmental workers noted, after
“the toads burst, the entrails slid out.

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.220
But the animals [weren’t] immediately dead
– they keep struggling for several minutes.”

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:52.060
With no explanation at hand, scientists with
Hamburg’s Institute for Hygiene and the

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:56.630
Environment tested the pond’s water quality,
searched for a fungus or virus (the latter

00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:00.053
of which was hypothesized to have been transmitted
from horses at a nearby race track), and even

00:01:00.053 --> 00:01:01.053
considered the somewhat fantastical notion
that the toads may have been purposely killing

00:01:01.053 --> 00:01:02.053
themselves to prevent overpopulation.

00:01:02.053 --> 00:01:03.053
(Aside: Ants sometimes do something like this,
for the good of the colony.

00:01:03.053 --> 00:01:04.053
Specifically, certain species of ants have
suicide bomber ants.

00:01:04.053 --> 00:01:05.053
When these suicide bomber ants encounter enemies,
such as ants from another colony, they will

00:01:05.053 --> 00:01:06.053
literally explode, causing a chemical to cover
the enemies around them.

00:01:06.053 --> 00:01:07.053
This chemical is extremely sticky and when
it dries will immobilize any enemy ants, eventually

00:01:07.053 --> 00:01:08.053
resulting in them dying.

00:01:08.053 --> 00:01:09.053
The Forelius pusillus ant also has worker
ants that will sacrifice themselves for the

00:01:09.053 --> 00:01:10.053
good of the colony, but this time in a slightly
different manner than the exploding ants.

00:01:10.053 --> 00:01:11.053
Every night, the nest of a colony needs sealed
off in such a way that the nest will be undetectable

00:01:11.053 --> 00:01:12.053
from the outside, in order to protect it from
predators.

00:01:12.053 --> 00:01:13.053
As such, sick ants or ones who are older will
apparently volunteer to perform the task of

00:01:13.053 --> 00:01:14.053
staying outside the nest at night.

00:01:14.053 --> 00:01:15.053
Once all the rest of the ants are inside,
the sacrificial ants will seal up the entrance

00:01:15.053 --> 00:01:16.053
and usually will end up dying from being left
outside.

00:01:16.053 --> 00:01:17.053
Even when researchers have collected these
sacrificial ants and taken care of them, they

00:01:17.053 --> 00:01:18.053
usually die soon anyways, which is why it
is thought that generally older or sick ants

00:01:18.053 --> 00:01:19.053
are chosen for this task.)

00:01:19.053 --> 00:01:20.053
In any event, each of these theories on the
exploding frog front were rejected, and authorities

00:01:20.053 --> 00:01:21.053
were forced to warn residents away from the
pools until an answer was found.

00:01:21.053 --> 00:01:22.053
An eminent amphibian expert from Berlin, Dr.
Frank Mutschmann, carefully examined live

00:01:22.053 --> 00:01:23.053
and dead specimens and noticed several interesting
facts:

00:01:23.053 --> 00:01:24.053
Each had a small circular incision on its
back

00:01:24.053 --> 00:01:25.053
Each was missing its liver
None had any other bite or scratch marks

00:01:25.053 --> 00:01:28.829
This last was especially significant, since
it proved that neither rats nor raccoons were

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.130
attacking the toads.

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:34.549
Of particular note, however, was the size
of the circular incision, which matched the

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:36.280
size of a bird’s beak.

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:40.970
Knowing how clever crows are, Dr. Mutschmann
theorized the birds were aware that the toad’s

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:45.020
skin was poisonous, but that the nutritious
liver could easily be popped out with little

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:46.049
toxic exposure.

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.299
His theory also explained how the toads’
exploding reaction appeared to come well after

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:49.299
they lost their livers.

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:50.299
Since it was mating season, the toads would
have been so distracted by their biological

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:51.299
imperative that they wouldn’t have paid
heed to a few quick pecks:

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:52.299
Only once the liver is gone does the toad
realize it’s been attacked.

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:54.159
It puffs itself up as a natural defence mechanism.

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:58.100
But since it doesn’t have a diaphragm or
ribs, without the liver there is nothing to

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:59.100
hold the rest of its organs in.

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.420
The lungs stretch out of all proportion and
rip; the rest of the organs simply expel themselves.

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.560
After Dr. Mutschmann’s explanation came
to light, besides being confirmed, it was

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.440
soon discovered that exploding toad epidemics
have happened before in Germany and Denmark

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:28.830
as well as in Belgium and the U.S.
