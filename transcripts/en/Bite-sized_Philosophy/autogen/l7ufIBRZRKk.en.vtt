hill and there's no shortage of rocks to
put up to push up the hill and that's

put up to push up the hill and that's
 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.359
put up to push up the hill and that's
what we're built for anyways and so

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369
what we're built for anyways and so
 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.640

let's go out and like push some down
 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.320
let's go out and like push some down
boulders up the hill and then maybe we

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330
boulders up the hill and then maybe we
 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.089
boulders up the hill and then maybe we
could have enough self-confidence and

enough enough respect for ourselves that

which is the notion that you should be

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620
which is the notion that you should be
 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.770
which is the notion that you should be
able to recognize in yourself all the

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780
able to recognize in yourself all the
 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.900
able to recognize in yourself all the
horror of humanity and take

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910
horror of humanity and take
 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.670
horror of humanity and take
responsibility for it because that's

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680
responsibility for it because that's
 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.439
responsibility for it because that's
what that means and the thing that's so

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449
what that means and the thing that's so
 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:01.849
what that means and the thing that's so
interesting about that is that if you

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859
interesting about that is that if you
 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.160
interesting about that is that if you
can recognize yourself in yourself all

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170
can recognize yourself in yourself all
 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.020
can recognize yourself in yourself all
the horror of humanity you will

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030
the horror of humanity you will
 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.310
the horror of humanity you will
instantly have a hell of a lot more

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320
instantly have a hell of a lot more
 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.990
instantly have a hell of a lot more
respect for yourself than you did before

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000
respect for yourself than you did before
 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
respect for yourself than you did before
you did that because there's some real

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010
you did that because there's some real
 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.550
you did that because there's some real
utility in knowing that you're a monster

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:12.560
utility in knowing that you're a monster
 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.539
utility in knowing that you're a monster
now and just because you're a monster

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549
now and just because you're a monster
 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.490
now and just because you're a monster
doesn't mean you have to be a monster

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500
doesn't mean you have to be a monster
 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.620
doesn't mean you have to be a monster
but it's really useful to know that you

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630
but it's really useful to know that you
 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.469
but it's really useful to know that you
are one so then and one of the things

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479
are one so then and one of the things
 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.600
are one so then and one of the things
that you knew and this is something that

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610
that you knew and this is something that
 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.940
that you knew and this is something that
I find so amazing about his writings I

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950
I find so amazing about his writings I
 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:26.929
I find so amazing about his writings I
think something that really

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939
think something that really
 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.550
think something that really
distinguishes him for example from

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560
distinguishes him for example from
 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:29.780
distinguishes him for example from
Joseph Campbell who talked about

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790
Joseph Campbell who talked about
 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.090
Joseph Campbell who talked about
following your bliss is like Jung said

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100
following your bliss is like Jung said
 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.010
following your bliss is like Jung said
very clearly that the first step to

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020
very clearly that the first step to
 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.749
very clearly that the first step to
enlightenment is the encounter with the

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759
enlightenment is the encounter with the
 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.170
enlightenment is the encounter with the
shadow and what he meant by that was

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:38.180
shadow and what he meant by that was
 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:40.550
shadow and what he meant by that was
everything horrible that human beings

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560
everything horrible that human beings
 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.460
everything horrible that human beings
have done was done by human beings and

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470
have done was done by human beings and
 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.639
have done was done by human beings and
you're one of them and so if you don't

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649
you're one of them and so if you don't
 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.469
you're one of them and so if you don't
understand that and to understand that

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479
understand that and to understand that
 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.350
understand that and to understand that
really means to know how it was that you

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360
really means to know how it was that you
 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.850
really means to know how it was that you
could have done it and that's a

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860
could have done it and that's a
 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.190
could have done it and that's a
shattering thing to try to imagine that

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200
shattering thing to try to imagine that
 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.200
shattering thing to try to imagine that
to try to imagine yourself as someone

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210
to try to imagine yourself as someone
 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.990
to try to imagine yourself as someone
who's engaged in medieval torture to see

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000
who's engaged in medieval torture to see
 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.850
who's engaged in medieval torture to see
how you could in fact do that

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860
how you could in fact do that
 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.260
how you could in fact do that
you're never the same after you learn

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270
you're never the same after you learn
 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.289
you're never the same after you learn
that but being never the same after

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299
that but being never the same after
 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:07.910
that but being never the same after
learning that is unbelievably useful

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920
learning that is unbelievably useful
 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.589
learning that is unbelievably useful
because when you understand that that's

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599
because when you understand that that's
 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:10.850
because when you understand that that's
what you're like

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860
what you're like
 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.229
what you're like
then you're a whole different creature

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239
then you're a whole different creature
 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:13.730
then you're a whole different creature
and I don't think and this is

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740
and I don't think and this is
 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.050
and I don't think and this is
something I did learn from young is that

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060
something I did learn from young is that
 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.840
something I did learn from young is that
you cannot be a good person until you

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:17.850
you cannot be a good person until you
 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:20.600
you cannot be a good person until you
know how much evil you contain within

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610
know how much evil you contain within
 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.850
know how much evil you contain within
you it is not possible and it's partly

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860
you it is not possible and it's partly
 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:24.460
you it is not possible and it's partly
because you just don't have any potency

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470
because you just don't have any potency
 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:27.410
because you just don't have any potency
like if you're just naive if you're just

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420
like if you're just naive if you're just
 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.120
like if you're just naive if you're just
nice if you'd never hurt anyone you've

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130
nice if you'd never hurt anyone you've
 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:30.470
nice if you'd never hurt anyone you've
never heard of fly you don't have the

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480
never heard of fly you don't have the
 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.120
never heard of fly you don't have the
capability for any of that why would

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130
capability for any of that why would
 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:35.030
capability for any of that why would
anyone ever take you seriously you're

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040
anyone ever take you seriously you're
 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.890
anyone ever take you seriously you're
you're just you're a domestic animal at

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900
you're just you're a domestic animal at
 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.990
you're just you're a domestic animal at
best you know and a rather contemptible

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000
best you know and a rather contemptible
 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.850
best you know and a rather contemptible
one at that and it's a very strange

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860
one at that and it's a very strange
 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:42.710
one at that and it's a very strange
thing because you wouldn't think that

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720
thing because you wouldn't think that
 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.110
thing because you wouldn't think that
the revelation of the capacity for evil

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120
the revelation of the capacity for evil
 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.480
the revelation of the capacity for evil
is a precondition for the realization of

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:47.490
is a precondition for the realization of
 

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:49.460
is a precondition for the realization of
good but I believe first of all why

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470
good but I believe first of all why
 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.530
good but I believe first of all why
would you be serious enough to even

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540
would you be serious enough to even
 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.660
would you be serious enough to even
attempt to pursue the good unless you

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670
attempt to pursue the good unless you
 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:55.970
attempt to pursue the good unless you
had some sense of what the consequence

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980
had some sense of what the consequence
 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:59.150
had some sense of what the consequence
was of not doing it you have to be

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160
was of not doing it you have to be

was of not doing it you have to be
serious about these sorts of things it's
