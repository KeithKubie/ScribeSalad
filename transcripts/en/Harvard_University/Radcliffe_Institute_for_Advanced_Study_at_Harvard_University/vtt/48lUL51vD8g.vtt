00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.220
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:07.900
- I want to welcome you back
to our second panel, which

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:10.600
is on gender, sports,
health, and wellness.

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:14.050
And it's my real pleasure to
introduce our moderator, Dr.

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:18.880
Cheri Blauwet, who I know
from organizing on the panel

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:22.900
and who I knew already as a
doctor of physical medicine

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:25.180
and rehabilitation
at Harvard Medical

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:27.010
School, my own hospital--

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:30.610
Brigham Women's Hospital--
and Spaulding Rehabilitation

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:33.520
Hospital, where she's a
principal investigator

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:36.910
for the Kelley Adaptive
Sports Research Institute.

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:40.240
What I didn't know, until I read
her biography just yesterday,

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:44.770
that she also has
seven Paralympic medals

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:49.216
and has won both the Boston
and the New York marathons.

00:00:49.216 --> 00:00:52.618
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:57.840
Cheri has also addressed
the United Nations

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.660
on behalf of athletes.

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.933
So, please welcome me
in welcoming Cheri.

00:01:03.933 --> 00:01:07.314
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:09.152 --> 00:01:10.360
- Thank you very much, Janet.

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:13.180
And thanks, everyone, for
returning for our second panel

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:14.800
of the morning.

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:16.780
The focus of our
session will be a bit

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:20.320
of a deeper dive on the topic
of gender, sports, health,

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:21.280
and wellness.

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.670
And I'd like to take a brief
moment to encourage everyone,

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:30.160
on the back of your program
is the social media handle,

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:31.740
the hashtag, etc. for today.

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.030
So, please feel free to
be active on social media.

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:36.190
We really want what
we're doing here

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:40.330
to get out in the broader
public discourse via some

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:42.670
of those outlets, as
well as via the webcast.

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:45.110
So, thanks for
engaging in that way.

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:47.050
So, when we first
initiated planning meetings

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:48.670
to bring this
conference together,

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:51.040
it became very
clear, very quickly

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:52.930
that topics related
to health and medicine

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:54.430
were some of the
hottest topics that

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:57.145
are out there in the public
discourse, in the media,

00:01:57.145 --> 00:01:59.410
and what people
are talking about.

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:01.990
And we then realized that,
indeed, really health wellness

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:03.610
is quite broadly
defined, when we

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:06.200
think about the interaction
of gender and sport.

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.610
And it encompasses concepts
like gender disparities

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:12.670
in common sports injuries,
like ACL tears and concussions,

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:13.870
for example--

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:15.700
both in terms of
their incidence,

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.650
or how much they
happen, but also

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:20.950
how they're treated, so,
who ends up having surgery

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:23.650
or not after an ACL
tear, and who returns

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:26.140
to play after a concussion.

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:29.800
And it's more likely that
in this post-Title-IX boom,

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.770
with over three million
high school girls competing

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:35.320
in sports, as was
noted this morning,

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:38.920
that these topics are going to
become more and more important.

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:43.270
How we address treatment and
issues related to sports injury

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:45.820
according to gender is going
to become even more important

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:47.290
over time.

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:49.270
It also encompasses
the impact of gender

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:53.080
on youth sport participation
as a measure of wellness.

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:55.420
And, you know, these days,
the childhood obesity rate

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:57.220
is estimated at up to 30%.

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.190
So, when we think about
how gender impacts things

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:03.400
like implicit bias and
unconscious perceptions of who

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.580
we expect to be active,
who do we expect to engage

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:09.760
in physical activity in sport
as a means of healthy lifestyles

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.980
as they move into
adulthood, we can

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:14.620
see that that is a critical
component of when we think

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:16.300
about health and wellness.

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:18.430
And last but not least,
in our elite athletes,

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:20.380
how much is too much?

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:22.810
And we know that athletes
often feel the pressure to win

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:26.080
at all costs, despite the
potential for adverse health

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:28.720
outcomes, related to things
like packed competition

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:32.140
schedules, over-training,
and even when athletes

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:33.880
are tempted to cross
the line into use

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:35.590
of performance-enhancing
substances,

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:40.100
and prohibited methods,
and other mechanisms.

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:42.520
So we're thrilled to host
these three esteemed panelists

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:44.936
to help us work through some
of these challenging and very

00:03:44.936 --> 00:03:47.962
timely themes all related
to health and wellness.

00:03:47.962 --> 00:03:49.420
And each of these
three individuals

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:51.220
really works at the
intersection of what's

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:54.910
going on, in terms of how we're
interacting with athletes.

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:57.580
And I think we'll provide
very interesting insights

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:00.670
and perspectives on how we
grapple with these issues

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:03.170
and also the way
forward into the future.

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:05.170
So, as with earlier
in the morning,

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:07.390
you'll note that
the full biographies

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:11.230
are in your conference program.

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:13.930
So, just very briefly, I'll
introduce our speakers.

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:16.360
Dr. Brian Hainline is
the chief medical officer

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:19.089
for the National Collegiate
Athletic Association,

00:04:19.089 --> 00:04:22.029
and also clinical professor of
neurology at Indiana University

00:04:22.029 --> 00:04:24.310
School of Medicine at NYU.

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:27.227
And I think Dr. Hainline
provides a very amazing example

00:04:27.227 --> 00:04:29.560
of blending a clinical career
with leadership and policy

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:30.310
change.

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:32.710
He's been active with the
American Academy of Neurology

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:34.870
Sports Section, as far as
the International Tennis

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:36.190
Federation.

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:40.060
And with tennis more broadly,
as a sport for many years,

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:42.970
he also oversees the NCAA
Sports Science Institute, so

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:47.860
blending that issues of research
as they impact athletes.

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:49.720
So welcome, Dr. Hainline.

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:51.370
Our next speaker
will be Travis Tygart

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:55.030
from the chief executive officer
of the US Anti-Doping Agency,

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:56.290
or USADA.

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:58.990
And Travis is really at the
helm of helping USADA carry out

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:01.870
its mission of preserving
integrity of competition,

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:03.550
inspiring true
sport, and protecting

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:05.282
the rights of clean athletes.

00:05:05.282 --> 00:05:07.740
He's also been at the helm of
many important investigations

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:10.240
and, of course,
been very prominent

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:12.310
in public and in the
media, such as the BALCO

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:14.725
investigation, the
US Postal Service,

00:05:14.725 --> 00:05:17.030
and Lance Armstrong, etc.

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:19.690
So, under his leadership,
USADA has really led the way,

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:21.370
and also been really
involved in what

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:25.120
happens at the grassroots
level with the issues related

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:28.306
to true sport and how we impart
ethics in our young people

00:05:28.306 --> 00:05:30.180
as they progress through
their sports career.

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:31.990
So welcome, Travis.

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:35.270
And our third speaker
will be Dr. Parissa Safai,

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:37.807
who's an associate professor
at the School of Kinesiology

00:05:37.807 --> 00:05:39.640
and Health Science and
the Faculty of Health

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:41.860
at York University in Toronto.

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:44.380
And Parissa will really bring
us a very unique and important

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:46.510
lens for the morning, as
her research has focused

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:49.520
on the sport at the intersection
of risk, health, and health

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:53.080
care, including topics such
as the culture of risk,

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:55.450
social determinants
of athlete's health,

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:58.600
and the impact of various
inequalities related to gender,

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:02.110
socioeconomic disparities, and
ethnic, cultural issues on how

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:05.480
we access physical activity and
how these impact our society.

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:07.480
So welcome, Dr. Safai.

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:09.260
So without further
ado, in our panel.

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.630
And just a brief
reminder on mechanics,

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:13.940
we'll hear from each
speaker for 15 minutes.

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:17.630
We'll then open it up for
intra-panel Q&amp;A and a bit more

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:19.970
discussion on some of
the topics that come up.

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:22.220
And then we'll open
up for audience Q&amp;A,

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:24.980
as well, prior to
heading into the lunch.

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:26.180
So, thank you very much.

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:28.810
And without further ado, we'll
invite Dr. Hainline's comments.

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:32.065
[APPLAUSE]

00:06:35.279 --> 00:06:36.320
- Well, thank you, Cheri.

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:40.630
And thank you, everyone,
for this great conference.

00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:43.300
And I'm really fired up just
being here and listening.

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:45.880
And it was a little difficult
for me to prepare for this.

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:47.620
It wasn't your
typical medical talk.

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:49.540
I had to really step
outside of the box

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:52.080
and think about what
I was going to say.

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:54.070
And so, the first thing
I did was a little bit

00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:54.940
of history checking.

00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:56.920
And I came up with
this great photo.

00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:59.320
This is the Radcliffe crew team.

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:01.884
It is the only Harvard
varsity sport team

00:07:01.884 --> 00:07:03.300
which carries the
name "Radcliffe"

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:05.750
and which wears the
Radcliffe colors, so--

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:08.250
[APPLAUSE]

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:10.480
Go Radcliffe Crew.

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:12.040
So, I'm the chief
medical officer

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:14.969
of the NCAA, the first
chief medical officer.

00:07:14.969 --> 00:07:17.260
I've been at his job for a
little more than four years.

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:19.760
The NCAA, for those
of you who don't know,

00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:22.600
is the governing body
of college varsity

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:26.470
sports for 1,100 schools,
500,000 student athletes.

00:07:26.470 --> 00:07:28.150
We were formed in 1906.

00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:29.620
Really, it was
President Roosevelt

00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:32.890
at the time who decided that we
needed to have a governing body

00:07:32.890 --> 00:07:36.765
to really oversee football
because there were 18 football

00:07:36.765 --> 00:07:38.140
deaths the year
before, and there

00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:39.480
was an existential crisis.

00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:43.120
So, flash forward, 90% of my
headaches for the 23 sports

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:46.330
and 90 championships that
we oversee is football.

00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:49.230
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:49.230 --> 00:07:51.870
The NCAA is a
membership-driven organization.

00:07:51.870 --> 00:07:52.890
It's bottom-up.

00:07:52.890 --> 00:07:54.390
So, when we read
in the newspaper,

00:07:54.390 --> 00:07:57.300
the NCAA didn't do this,
the NCAA didn't do that--

00:07:57.300 --> 00:07:59.410
it's the membership.

00:07:59.410 --> 00:08:02.130
We are the opposite of
top-down organizations,

00:08:02.130 --> 00:08:05.241
such as the NFL and
the Catholic church.

00:08:05.241 --> 00:08:07.890
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:07.890 --> 00:08:10.125
I have no disclosures.

00:08:10.125 --> 00:08:13.350
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:13.850 --> 00:08:15.720
Although I did go to Notre Dame.

00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:19.190
So, there's a
Catholic disclosure.

00:08:19.190 --> 00:08:22.640
I'm going to just give a very,
very brief overview of things

00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:24.830
that I believe are
pertinent to the NCAA

00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:27.110
because, after all,
that's my world.

00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:29.210
We won't take a deep
dive into any of these.

00:08:29.210 --> 00:08:31.800
We really don't have the time.

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:33.440
So, let's look at
participation rates.

00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:35.120
We've talked about this briefly.

00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:37.520
And we could look and say,
wow, participation rates

00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:40.820
for women's sports have really
been increasing considerably

00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:41.679
over the years.

00:08:41.679 --> 00:08:42.950
And, yay, Title IX.

00:08:42.950 --> 00:08:44.620
And, yay, society.

00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:46.490
We're really getting
our act together.

00:08:46.490 --> 00:08:49.460
And when we talk to the
women who are in sport,

00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:52.160
they get a lot out of it.

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:55.460
They really love being athletes.

00:08:55.460 --> 00:08:58.610
And it drives them for
the rest of their life.

00:08:58.610 --> 00:09:01.930
And so it is a reason
to truly celebrate.

00:09:01.930 --> 00:09:05.240
But we can look at these same
statistics and say, well,

00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:06.580
is this a reason to celebrate?

00:09:06.580 --> 00:09:08.530
Or is this a reason to
look at our barriers?

00:09:08.530 --> 00:09:11.290
Because, well, look at this.

00:09:11.290 --> 00:09:14.140
Yes, there has been a great
increase in women participation

00:09:14.140 --> 00:09:14.980
in sport.

00:09:14.980 --> 00:09:18.520
But also, for all those
naysayers of Title IX,

00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:20.410
look at the growth
in men's sport.

00:09:20.410 --> 00:09:23.930
Title IX has done nothing
to diminish that growth.

00:09:23.930 --> 00:09:26.900
And look at the more recent
statistics about women

00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:28.880
in college compared to men.

00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:32.030
And they are the majority,
but the statistics

00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:34.430
are more than reversed
for women participation

00:09:34.430 --> 00:09:35.750
in college sports.

00:09:35.750 --> 00:09:37.760
So, there is still a gap.

00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:41.340
There are barriers
that still exist.

00:09:41.340 --> 00:09:43.920
I want to talk a little bit
about one aspect of sport

00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:46.980
injury that we've heard a lot
about, and that is concussion.

00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:48.510
And I will say very clearly--

00:09:48.510 --> 00:09:51.000
I've said this publicly
on many occasions--

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.670
concussion is the
elephant in the room.

00:09:53.670 --> 00:09:57.540
But the single most
important aspect

00:09:57.540 --> 00:10:01.230
of care that we need to address
for our student athletes

00:10:01.230 --> 00:10:02.980
is mental health.

00:10:02.980 --> 00:10:06.930
The student athletes have told
me that, time and time again.

00:10:06.930 --> 00:10:09.540
And I've visited over 100
schools, including Harvard,

00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:11.760
and I meet with the
student athletes.

00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:14.380
This is their number 1 concern.

00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:15.550
But what about concussion?

00:10:15.550 --> 00:10:16.970
So, we hear about concussion.

00:10:16.970 --> 00:10:18.790
We hear about football.

00:10:18.790 --> 00:10:20.680
And this is a study,
it was actually

00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:22.630
published just recently.

00:10:22.630 --> 00:10:24.880
And the rate of
concussion is determined

00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:26.590
by athletic exposures.

00:10:26.590 --> 00:10:29.200
The highest-risk sport
for rate of concussion

00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:30.730
is men's wrestling.

00:10:30.730 --> 00:10:32.440
But look at the
four women's sports

00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:35.410
that have virtually the same
rate of concussion as men's

00:10:35.410 --> 00:10:36.580
football--

00:10:36.580 --> 00:10:41.050
women's soccer, women's ice
hockey, women's basketball,

00:10:41.050 --> 00:10:42.970
woman's lacrosse.

00:10:42.970 --> 00:10:45.910
Now you should be shocked
that women's lacrosse is there

00:10:45.910 --> 00:10:47.570
because the rules
of woman lacrosse

00:10:47.570 --> 00:10:50.545
is that this is a
non-contact sport.

00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:55.150
Well, what about concussion?

00:10:55.150 --> 00:10:57.980
For every single major
aspect of health and safety,

00:10:57.980 --> 00:11:00.010
we must do a gap analysis.

00:11:00.010 --> 00:11:02.050
And the real gap analysis
is that we don't even

00:11:02.050 --> 00:11:04.490
know the natural
history of concussion.

00:11:04.490 --> 00:11:06.940
We have no idea what
neurobiological recovery

00:11:06.940 --> 00:11:08.140
is in concussion.

00:11:08.140 --> 00:11:10.870
And we know very
little about women

00:11:10.870 --> 00:11:13.840
who get concussed
because 95% of the world

00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:16.750
literature on concussion
is dominated by men's

00:11:16.750 --> 00:11:19.270
football and men's ice hockey.

00:11:19.270 --> 00:11:21.250
So, when we have a gap
analysis like that,

00:11:21.250 --> 00:11:22.930
we have to take action.

00:11:22.930 --> 00:11:24.550
We have to advocate.

00:11:24.550 --> 00:11:27.220
The NCAA partnered with
the Department of Defense,

00:11:27.220 --> 00:11:29.890
and we have put together the
largest prospective clinical

00:11:29.890 --> 00:11:33.220
longitudinal study ever done
in the history of concussion.

00:11:33.220 --> 00:11:36.250
It's currently with 30
schools, and our recent data

00:11:36.250 --> 00:11:39.790
tell us that we've now
analyzed over 30,000 athletes.

00:11:39.790 --> 00:11:41.820
We've tracked 2,000 concussions.

00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:43.780
And we're taking an
exceptionally deep dive

00:11:43.780 --> 00:11:46.250
into several
high-contact, risk sports,

00:11:46.250 --> 00:11:48.900
including women's ice hockey,
women's soccer, women's

00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:51.910
lacrosse, where the athletes
are wearing had accelerometers.

00:11:51.910 --> 00:11:54.540
They're getting genetic testing
blood biomarkers, genomics,

00:11:54.540 --> 00:11:55.780
and brain MRIs.

00:11:55.780 --> 00:11:59.110
So, we are going to understand
the neurobiology of concussion.

00:11:59.110 --> 00:12:01.540
I will say that of these
2,000 concussed athletes

00:12:01.540 --> 00:12:03.940
we've studied, 40% are women.

00:12:03.940 --> 00:12:07.920
A large study
before that was 20%.

00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:09.570
It's an exceptionally
intense study.

00:12:09.570 --> 00:12:11.490
I won't go into
the details of it.

00:12:11.490 --> 00:12:14.190
But athletes are
tested at baseline

00:12:14.190 --> 00:12:17.790
and then at subsequent
intervals over six months.

00:12:17.790 --> 00:12:22.170
On average, most athletes return
to play after a concussion

00:12:22.170 --> 00:12:23.940
by three weeks.

00:12:23.940 --> 00:12:26.760
If we sort that out-- and this
is not yet published data.

00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:29.151
It has not been vetted in
peer-reviewed literature.

00:12:29.151 --> 00:12:30.900
And by the way, in all
the literature that

00:12:30.900 --> 00:12:32.370
is going to come
from this study,

00:12:32.370 --> 00:12:34.380
I will only be on the
first two studies,

00:12:34.380 --> 00:12:36.150
the methodological studies.

00:12:36.150 --> 00:12:38.820
I will not be part of
any of the data analysis.

00:12:38.820 --> 00:12:40.770
And these studies are
being run independently

00:12:40.770 --> 00:12:42.420
by our member schools.

00:12:42.420 --> 00:12:45.590
But the athletes that return
the quickest after a concussion

00:12:45.590 --> 00:12:48.771
are our contact-sport athletes.

00:12:48.771 --> 00:12:50.520
I'm not going to give
you the why of that.

00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:51.580
We can talk about that.

00:12:51.580 --> 00:12:53.400
We can hypothesize about that.

00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:55.170
But it's the non-contact
sport athletes

00:12:55.170 --> 00:12:57.870
that take the longest
to return to play.

00:12:57.870 --> 00:13:01.470
And women, in general,
are taking two days longer

00:13:01.470 --> 00:13:02.310
to play--

00:13:02.310 --> 00:13:04.650
to return to play, after
a concussion than men.

00:13:04.650 --> 00:13:06.600
I will tell you
right off the bat,

00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:09.540
women concuss
differently than men--

00:13:09.540 --> 00:13:14.350
neurophysiologically
and biomechanically.

00:13:14.350 --> 00:13:16.270
That's just a fact.

00:13:16.270 --> 00:13:19.540
It's not a statement of saying
women and men do mathematics

00:13:19.540 --> 00:13:20.560
differently.

00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:23.160
It's saying that women
concuss differently.

00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:25.300
And part of it, in
childbearing ages,

00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:27.130
is because of the
profound influence

00:13:27.130 --> 00:13:30.010
of estradiol, which prepares
the woman every month

00:13:30.010 --> 00:13:34.430
to receive a fertilized egg.

00:13:34.430 --> 00:13:36.380
And that has a
profound effect on what

00:13:36.380 --> 00:13:38.720
we call spreading ways
of electrical depression

00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:41.600
in brain activity, which is
one of the pathophysiologic

00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:45.290
mechanisms of migraine and
also for a prolonged concussion

00:13:45.290 --> 00:13:46.700
recovery.

00:13:46.700 --> 00:13:49.910
Women, in general, also,
they have more symptoms

00:13:49.910 --> 00:13:51.860
to report than men.

00:13:51.860 --> 00:13:53.810
These are just facts.

00:13:53.810 --> 00:13:56.180
And at some point, we are
going to take a deep dive

00:13:56.180 --> 00:13:57.010
into the why.

00:14:00.070 --> 00:14:01.930
Moving to sexual
violence, the NCAA

00:14:01.930 --> 00:14:05.200
has put out just recently the
Sexual Violence Prevention Tool

00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:06.010
Kit.

00:14:06.010 --> 00:14:08.710
Every member school
has this toolkit.

00:14:08.710 --> 00:14:12.430
It has been endorsed by 12
higher education organizations.

00:14:12.430 --> 00:14:15.310
And our goal is to
widely socialize this.

00:14:15.310 --> 00:14:18.250
The Board of Governors, who is
the highest ranking committee

00:14:18.250 --> 00:14:20.580
for the NCAA made
of 16 presidents,

00:14:20.580 --> 00:14:22.720
they just appointed
a special commission

00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:25.000
to look deeper into
this, and to come up

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.550
with policy that will be
independent of Title IX

00:14:27.550 --> 00:14:28.390
and Clery.

00:14:28.390 --> 00:14:30.200
Why?

00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:34.380
Because Clery, as we know
it, may be gone soon.

00:14:34.380 --> 00:14:38.280
Violence Against Women Act,
as we know it, may be gone.

00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:40.710
Title IX may shift to
the Department of Justice

00:14:40.710 --> 00:14:42.480
from the Department
of Education.

00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:46.350
We must be actively
prepared for the future.

00:14:46.350 --> 00:14:49.770
And we are addressing
this with sexual violence.

00:14:49.770 --> 00:14:55.440
Looking at a recent study that
looked over 25,000 college

00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:56.370
students--

00:14:56.370 --> 00:14:59.340
so the rate of sexual
violence, even in one year,

00:14:59.340 --> 00:15:02.790
it varies from school to school,
but it is still astoundingly

00:15:02.790 --> 00:15:05.105
high up to 20% in some schools.

00:15:05.105 --> 00:15:06.480
And we will look
at these college

00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:09.600
students and their lifetime
incidents of sexual violence.

00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:12.010
It's astoundingly high.

00:15:12.010 --> 00:15:14.590
This is part of our society.

00:15:14.590 --> 00:15:16.600
This is humanity.

00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:19.660
This is Homo sapiens.

00:15:19.660 --> 00:15:22.090
And when we look at
those individuals

00:15:22.090 --> 00:15:24.820
and talk to those individuals
who have been victims,

00:15:24.820 --> 00:15:28.900
they are much more likely to
be hopeless, to be depressed,

00:15:28.900 --> 00:15:32.920
and to actually suffer with
psychiatric conditions.

00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:34.540
And I'll just take
a pause right now

00:15:34.540 --> 00:15:36.940
because I have treated
thousands of victims

00:15:36.940 --> 00:15:40.030
of the most horrendous sexual
and interpersonal violence

00:15:40.030 --> 00:15:41.480
ever.

00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:45.140
That was part of my
subspecialty as a neurologist--

00:15:45.140 --> 00:15:47.960
working with
Holocaust survivors,

00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:51.260
working with survivors of
other profound violence.

00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:54.540
And when you talk to
these individuals,

00:15:54.540 --> 00:15:59.590
and you try to
understand, you realize

00:15:59.590 --> 00:16:04.250
that free will, as we
may hypothesize about it,

00:16:04.250 --> 00:16:06.470
as we may think
metaphysically about it--

00:16:06.470 --> 00:16:09.800
it no longer exists.

00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:12.950
It doesn't exist at the
moment of sexual violence

00:16:12.950 --> 00:16:16.490
and from every
moment thereafter.

00:16:16.490 --> 00:16:19.490
Because it changes
your physiology.

00:16:19.490 --> 00:16:22.130
It changes your
perception of life.

00:16:22.130 --> 00:16:24.680
And unless there is a
miraculous, neurobiological

00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:27.710
reconciliation,
peacefully, and almost

00:16:27.710 --> 00:16:29.780
with what we call
unconditional love,

00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:33.520
your physiology is
forever changed.

00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:34.975
Free will no longer exists.

00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:41.120
Moving to some
lighter subjects--

00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:42.374
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:43.210 --> 00:16:45.280
--anterior cruciate
ligament tears,

00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:51.580
we know that females have a
much higher rate of ACL tears

00:16:51.580 --> 00:16:52.990
than males.

00:16:52.990 --> 00:16:53.920
Why?

00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:55.450
Well, there are a few reasons.

00:16:55.450 --> 00:16:57.910
But let's look at
the societal reasons

00:16:57.910 --> 00:16:59.530
and the neurobiological reasons.

00:16:59.530 --> 00:17:02.890
Because an ACL tear is
not a mechanical issue.

00:17:02.890 --> 00:17:06.730
It's a neuromuscular,
maladaptive response.

00:17:06.730 --> 00:17:09.609
It is, when you look
at the women who

00:17:09.609 --> 00:17:12.950
are landing in their
ready position,

00:17:12.950 --> 00:17:15.160
and if they're landing
repetitively like this,

00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:17.410
with poor neuromuscular
control, that's

00:17:17.410 --> 00:17:19.960
a profound stress on the ACL.

00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:22.569
It is not the proper
land, like this.

00:17:22.569 --> 00:17:24.910
And when we have,
in our society,

00:17:24.910 --> 00:17:26.920
people who are
specializing in sport

00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:28.300
before the age of puberty--

00:17:28.300 --> 00:17:33.170
despite all of the data that
it is the wrong thing to do--

00:17:33.170 --> 00:17:35.350
and then, when you look at
what happens at puberty,

00:17:35.350 --> 00:17:37.660
and testosterone
takes over in men,

00:17:37.660 --> 00:17:40.540
and that goes right
to the muscles,

00:17:40.540 --> 00:17:44.210
it gives the men an advantage.

00:17:44.210 --> 00:17:47.500
And when you have someone who is
highly specialized, who doesn't

00:17:47.500 --> 00:17:49.240
know how to land,
who doesn't have

00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:51.940
testosterone receptors
in their muscular system,

00:17:51.940 --> 00:17:54.310
and you have a repetitive,
maladaptive response,

00:17:54.310 --> 00:17:56.380
you have data like this.

00:17:56.380 --> 00:17:59.510
It is simply not acceptable.

00:17:59.510 --> 00:18:00.880
Now, we talked about tennis.

00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:02.590
I'm not going to go
through all of these.

00:18:02.590 --> 00:18:04.630
But the tennis injury
rates are similar.

00:18:04.630 --> 00:18:07.750
And I do agree,
tennis is not perfect.

00:18:07.750 --> 00:18:10.570
But we should study
tennis because it's

00:18:10.570 --> 00:18:12.880
pretty close to perfect.

00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:15.320
You go to the US Open
tennis championships,

00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:17.290
and on any given
day or night, we

00:18:17.290 --> 00:18:19.090
are paying equal
amounts of money,

00:18:19.090 --> 00:18:21.580
and the women are getting
equal amounts of pay,

00:18:21.580 --> 00:18:26.260
for the single largest annual
sporting event in the world.

00:18:26.260 --> 00:18:29.110
But I won't talk
about tennis anymore,

00:18:29.110 --> 00:18:31.722
other than that, when
I visit every school--

00:18:31.722 --> 00:18:33.930
and I'm a former tennis
player, and I still compete--

00:18:33.930 --> 00:18:35.490
I always meet with
the tennis team.

00:18:35.490 --> 00:18:38.160
And I tell them in silence,
behind closed doors

00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:40.410
that, yes, there
are 23 NCAA sports,

00:18:40.410 --> 00:18:42.672
but tennis is definitely
the greatest sport.

00:18:42.672 --> 00:18:44.400
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:48.690
And what about what's
happening since Title IX?

00:18:48.690 --> 00:18:51.740
Who's overseeing all of this?

00:18:51.740 --> 00:18:56.440
Who's overseeing the
care of our women?

00:18:56.440 --> 00:18:59.110
Because it does
make a difference.

00:18:59.110 --> 00:19:03.090
Pre-Title IX, when we
looked at coaches, well,

00:19:03.090 --> 00:19:05.080
women's athletics were
separate from men.

00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:08.410
So, the vast, vast
majority-- close to 100%--

00:19:08.410 --> 00:19:11.930
of coaches for women's
teams were female.

00:19:11.930 --> 00:19:20.270
We've been stuck at about
between 40%, 45% for years.

00:19:20.270 --> 00:19:23.100
Does it make sense?

00:19:23.100 --> 00:19:26.190
Well, ask this question--
does it make sense

00:19:26.190 --> 00:19:28.680
that we've been
stuck at this amount,

00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:33.970
at this rate of athletic
directors across the NCAA?

00:19:33.970 --> 00:19:36.940
We should be as
complacent with this data

00:19:36.940 --> 00:19:39.370
as we are with the data
of the number of females

00:19:39.370 --> 00:19:42.400
in the current President
Trump's cabinet,

00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:45.100
or with the number of females
who have been president

00:19:45.100 --> 00:19:46.480
of the United States.

00:19:46.480 --> 00:19:49.430
We cannot be complacent
with this data.

00:19:49.430 --> 00:19:52.570
The NCAA has recently sent
out a presidential pledge.

00:19:52.570 --> 00:19:56.110
It has gone to the president
of every one of the 1,100 NCAA

00:19:56.110 --> 00:19:56.860
schools.

00:19:56.860 --> 00:20:03.650
And 75% have signed on to this
to make a concerted effort

00:20:03.650 --> 00:20:09.550
to shift the gap for
diversity, for gender, for all

00:20:09.550 --> 00:20:13.600
of the things that
truly matter to us.

00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:16.750
So, that's my brief,
very brief overview

00:20:16.750 --> 00:20:21.700
of some various aspects of
gender issues and sport.

00:20:21.700 --> 00:20:24.100
And I'm going to take
another giant step back

00:20:24.100 --> 00:20:27.370
because I'm really
listening very carefully.

00:20:27.370 --> 00:20:30.310
This first panel was nothing
short of exceptional.

00:20:30.310 --> 00:20:33.460
And again, I really thank you
from the bottom of my heart

00:20:33.460 --> 00:20:36.200
for allowing me to be here
and to learn from you.

00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:36.790
So, thank you.

00:20:36.790 --> 00:20:40.192
[APPLAUSE]

00:20:44.371 --> 00:20:45.120
- Well, thank you.

00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:46.036
It's great to be here.

00:20:46.036 --> 00:20:49.140
I'm Travis Tygart of the
US Anti-Doping Agency,

00:20:49.140 --> 00:20:52.219
and just want to first
thank Radcliffe institute

00:20:52.219 --> 00:20:53.510
for the invitation to be here--

00:20:53.510 --> 00:20:55.280
Liz, Rebecca, Jessica,
all your hard work

00:20:55.280 --> 00:20:56.321
in putting this together.

00:20:56.321 --> 00:20:58.104
It's truly an honor for me.

00:20:58.104 --> 00:20:59.270
And I'm thrilled to be here.

00:20:59.270 --> 00:21:02.840
I guess the only exception to
me being thrilled to be here

00:21:02.840 --> 00:21:06.836
is having to follow Brian
Hainline, who likewise,

00:21:06.836 --> 00:21:08.210
compared to this
morning's panel,

00:21:08.210 --> 00:21:12.030
gave a fantastic opening
remarks to this session.

00:21:12.030 --> 00:21:13.970
I also wanted to say
thank you to Cheri, who's

00:21:13.970 --> 00:21:16.730
been a personal hero
of mine, and really

00:21:16.730 --> 00:21:19.310
took simply a phone call, or
it might have been an email,

00:21:19.310 --> 00:21:20.645
from Cheri, asking me to come.

00:21:20.645 --> 00:21:22.144
And I said, absolutely
I'll be here.

00:21:22.144 --> 00:21:22.970
Anything for Cheri.

00:21:22.970 --> 00:21:24.950
And if you don't know
Cheri, I strongly

00:21:24.950 --> 00:21:26.325
encourage you to
get to know her.

00:21:26.325 --> 00:21:28.640
What she's done not only
on the athletic field,

00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:33.050
but off the field is just
flatly incredible, and one

00:21:33.050 --> 00:21:36.170
of the role models that all of
us should look to and honor.

00:21:36.170 --> 00:21:38.530
So, Cheri, thank you for
reaching out and having me

00:21:38.530 --> 00:21:39.029
here.

00:21:39.029 --> 00:21:42.074
[APPLAUSE]

00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:45.400
So, I'm going to
dive right into it.

00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:49.480
And I heard, I think, Donna said
she speaks fast because people

00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:51.806
retain when you speak faster.

00:21:51.806 --> 00:21:52.930
And that's good news to me.

00:21:52.930 --> 00:21:56.140
I always assumed I spoke
fast mainly because I'm

00:21:56.140 --> 00:22:00.010
a middle child, and I assume
at my house my parents never

00:22:00.010 --> 00:22:01.750
listen to me.

00:22:01.750 --> 00:22:03.400
And I never got
what I asked for.

00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:05.710
So, I'm glad to hear the
research has caught up.

00:22:05.710 --> 00:22:08.140
And I'll continue to speak
as fast as I possibly

00:22:08.140 --> 00:22:10.540
can and, particularly,
given the short 15 minutes

00:22:10.540 --> 00:22:13.750
that we've got here in
our opening remarks.

00:22:13.750 --> 00:22:16.730
Let me just say that the United
States Anti-Doping Agency,

00:22:16.730 --> 00:22:18.230
we're not a government
organization.

00:22:18.230 --> 00:22:19.850
We're not for-profit
organization.

00:22:19.850 --> 00:22:23.230
We are recognized by Congress
as the independent national

00:22:23.230 --> 00:22:26.560
anti-doping agency for
Olympic, Paralympic, and Pan

00:22:26.560 --> 00:22:28.120
American sports in
the United States.

00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:31.240
We also do run some
of the pro programs--

00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:33.520
UFC, specifically,
I'm happy to talk

00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:36.940
about that in the
discussion if it's

00:22:36.940 --> 00:22:39.130
relevant to any of you all.

00:22:39.130 --> 00:22:40.810
What is our job?

00:22:40.810 --> 00:22:45.181
We're here to protect
the athletes right.

00:22:45.181 --> 00:22:46.930
And you heard a little
bit of a discussion

00:22:46.930 --> 00:22:49.540
on the first panel about
privilege versus right.

00:22:49.540 --> 00:22:52.550
We could get into the
constitutional definitions

00:22:52.550 --> 00:22:53.740
under the 14th Amendment.

00:22:53.740 --> 00:22:55.180
I'm a lawyer by training.

00:22:55.180 --> 00:22:57.712
Whether or not it is a
constitutionally-protected

00:22:57.712 --> 00:22:59.920
right here in the United
States, you heard Anita talk

00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:02.080
about the right to
work laws that apply

00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:03.640
to athletes over in Europe.

00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:06.760
Bottom line-- however you
want to define "right,"

00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:07.510
it is a right.

00:23:07.510 --> 00:23:10.510
And athletes who
agree to the rules--

00:23:10.510 --> 00:23:13.480
and let's remember, and this is
a little bit of the philosophy

00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:15.550
major in me coming
out-- but sport

00:23:15.550 --> 00:23:21.390
is an agreement to a set
of rules by the competitors

00:23:21.390 --> 00:23:23.260
and to agree to
abide by the rules

00:23:23.260 --> 00:23:26.720
that all competitors
have agreed to abide by.

00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:27.670
And in our world--

00:23:27.670 --> 00:23:31.470
anti-doping-- when someone
uses a prohibited substance--

00:23:31.470 --> 00:23:33.970
might be an anabolic steroid,
might be human growth hormone,

00:23:33.970 --> 00:23:39.520
might be whatever the rule says
is not allowed that ultimately

00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:42.190
gives them a
performance-enhancing advantage

00:23:42.190 --> 00:23:43.682
under the rule--

00:23:43.682 --> 00:23:45.640
well, the person that
they're competing against

00:23:45.640 --> 00:23:47.170
is harmed by that.

00:23:47.170 --> 00:23:51.220
Their rights under the rule
aren't equally enforced.

00:23:51.220 --> 00:23:54.820
And they become, I think, in a
lot of people's mind, a victim.

00:23:54.820 --> 00:23:56.590
There is a global
set of rules that

00:23:56.590 --> 00:23:59.080
apply to all athletes
in the Olympic movement.

00:23:59.080 --> 00:24:00.370
It's called the WADA Code.

00:24:00.370 --> 00:24:06.160
This deals with the anti-doping
question within millions

00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:08.830
of athletes who compete
on a daily basis,

00:24:08.830 --> 00:24:11.320
literally hundreds of
sport organizations,

00:24:11.320 --> 00:24:14.270
with the exception of the
pro sports here in the United

00:24:14.270 --> 00:24:17.080
States, with the
exception of the NCAA--

00:24:17.080 --> 00:24:20.950
unless those athletes also
compete within the Olympic

00:24:20.950 --> 00:24:24.340
movement-- so the NBA Dream
Team, for example, or now,

00:24:24.340 --> 00:24:26.950
Redeem Team that
won a gold medal

00:24:26.950 --> 00:24:32.650
in '08, and '12, and again in
'16, despite losing in '04--

00:24:32.650 --> 00:24:35.710
they are all held under the
standards of our program

00:24:35.710 --> 00:24:38.580
that apply to athletes
like Cheri, like Stephanie,

00:24:38.580 --> 00:24:40.630
you heard earlier,
day in and day

00:24:40.630 --> 00:24:42.420
out within the Olympic movement.

00:24:42.420 --> 00:24:45.910
But right in the preamble
of the global rules--

00:24:45.910 --> 00:24:49.540
and by the way, relevant
for a short video I'm

00:24:49.540 --> 00:24:51.310
going to show you at the end--

00:24:51.310 --> 00:24:53.500
there is also an
international treaty

00:24:53.500 --> 00:24:54.970
that the United
States government

00:24:54.970 --> 00:24:57.490
has signed, ratified as
the Constitution requires

00:24:57.490 --> 00:24:59.440
by the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee,

00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:01.420
signed by President
Bush at the time.

00:25:01.420 --> 00:25:03.640
Close to 200 other
countries around the world

00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:08.540
have also signed that UNESCO
treaty against doping in sport,

00:25:08.540 --> 00:25:10.180
including Russia.

00:25:10.180 --> 00:25:12.700
And that's received
a lot of headlines

00:25:12.700 --> 00:25:15.400
recently with the
state-run doping

00:25:15.400 --> 00:25:19.154
that Russia has
perpetuated on the world.

00:25:19.154 --> 00:25:21.070
And I'm going to show
you a short video of it.

00:25:21.070 --> 00:25:23.410
But I think it's also
really important that there

00:25:23.410 --> 00:25:25.180
is an international treaty.

00:25:25.180 --> 00:25:28.060
There are sport
rules that all define

00:25:28.060 --> 00:25:31.090
how the global
stage for athletes

00:25:31.090 --> 00:25:32.434
is supposed to be conducted.

00:25:32.434 --> 00:25:33.850
So, you hear right--
you see right

00:25:33.850 --> 00:25:37.570
in the preamble, "to protect
athlete's fundamental right

00:25:37.570 --> 00:25:39.160
to participate in
doping-free sport,

00:25:39.160 --> 00:25:42.920
and thus promote health,
safety, and equality."

00:25:42.920 --> 00:25:45.280
And I think that is
at the heart of what

00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:46.640
you sought us here to do.

00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:49.630
We're simply the rules enforcer.

00:25:49.630 --> 00:25:52.090
While we have a big say
in what the rules are,

00:25:52.090 --> 00:25:54.430
when it comes time to those
rules being implemented

00:25:54.430 --> 00:25:56.800
in the United States
for our athletes, that's

00:25:56.800 --> 00:25:58.840
our job to ensure
that they're evenly,

00:25:58.840 --> 00:26:02.110
fairly, and thoroughly,
and robustly, enforced.

00:26:02.110 --> 00:26:04.450
Listen, I can give you
all the legalese you want

00:26:04.450 --> 00:26:08.110
and show you the language right
from the mouths of athletes.

00:26:08.110 --> 00:26:11.500
There's a UNC Tar Heel
grad, which I am--

00:26:11.500 --> 00:26:15.940
we're all very happy these
days after Monday night--

00:26:15.940 --> 00:26:19.540
but also, Marblehead, Mass.,
athlete who, just last week,

00:26:19.540 --> 00:26:22.360
and was confirmed
again yesterday,

00:26:22.360 --> 00:26:26.080
was upgraded from the bronze
medal in the '08 Olympic games

00:26:26.080 --> 00:26:29.170
to silver medal in
the Olympic games.

00:26:29.170 --> 00:26:31.660
Unfortunately, it
was nine-plus years

00:26:31.660 --> 00:26:34.270
later that she got wind of that.

00:26:34.270 --> 00:26:36.490
But you see her
tweeting out, I think,

00:26:36.490 --> 00:26:39.330
the sentiment that we hear
from our athletes day in

00:26:39.330 --> 00:26:40.900
and day out, which is--

00:26:40.900 --> 00:26:45.047
you know, and good for her of
putting her own interests aside

00:26:45.047 --> 00:26:47.380
and being willing to speak
for others because there were

00:26:47.380 --> 00:26:50.050
other athletes who
also got elevated

00:26:50.050 --> 00:26:51.580
and will receive
metals that were

00:26:51.580 --> 00:26:54.250
taken by other athletes
who doped at the time.

00:26:54.250 --> 00:26:56.500
And she says, I think
very eloquently,

00:26:56.500 --> 00:27:02.280
I'm gutted for those athletes
that had theirs stolen.

00:27:02.280 --> 00:27:05.287
So, in addition to
protecting our elite athletes

00:27:05.287 --> 00:27:07.620
within the Olympic, Paralympic,
and Pan Am movement here

00:27:07.620 --> 00:27:10.500
in the United States through
testing, research, education,

00:27:10.500 --> 00:27:12.879
and results management,
we also, from time

00:27:12.879 --> 00:27:14.670
to time, where appropriate
for our mission,

00:27:14.670 --> 00:27:15.780
embark on some research.

00:27:15.780 --> 00:27:18.900
And I think, academics in the
room, please go to our website.

00:27:18.900 --> 00:27:21.270
You can find this "What
Sport Means in America,"

00:27:21.270 --> 00:27:24.150
as well as companion
study, "True Sport,

00:27:24.150 --> 00:27:26.350
What We Stand to Lose in
Our Obsession to Win."

00:27:26.350 --> 00:27:27.760
I'm not going to spend
a bunch of time on it.

00:27:27.760 --> 00:27:29.700
But I there's some really
important findings.

00:27:29.700 --> 00:27:32.310
You know, sport-- as I think
you all probably agree,

00:27:32.310 --> 00:27:34.934
which is likely why you're here,
or you heard it from the first

00:27:34.934 --> 00:27:35.850
panel this morning--

00:27:35.850 --> 00:27:40.650
it touches our society
and our communities

00:27:40.650 --> 00:27:43.080
like almost no
other institution.

00:27:43.080 --> 00:27:46.510
Our research shows 162 million
here in the United States,

00:27:46.510 --> 00:27:50.430
roughly 3/5 of the population
have some relationship

00:27:50.430 --> 00:27:52.320
to sport-related activities.

00:27:52.320 --> 00:27:56.850
Parents overwhelmingly cite
personal and social values

00:27:56.850 --> 00:27:59.220
when describing their
hopes for their children

00:27:59.220 --> 00:28:00.330
in playing sport.

00:28:00.330 --> 00:28:02.790
And I was really struck
by Brian's statement

00:28:02.790 --> 00:28:05.240
about the mental health issue.

00:28:05.240 --> 00:28:08.340
And I think we have to ask
ourselves the question, what

00:28:08.340 --> 00:28:11.940
lessons are our
children learning when

00:28:11.940 --> 00:28:13.140
they get to the elite level?

00:28:13.140 --> 00:28:16.020
And Brian has access to
them through their surveys

00:28:16.020 --> 00:28:17.490
at the NCAA.

00:28:17.490 --> 00:28:19.050
Well what lessons
are they learning?

00:28:19.050 --> 00:28:22.150
What factors are causing
them, at that level,

00:28:22.150 --> 00:28:25.590
to have the mental health issues
that they're so willingly,

00:28:25.590 --> 00:28:27.030
apparently, to describe?

00:28:27.030 --> 00:28:31.710
Coaches also rank as the number
1 influence on today's youth

00:28:31.710 --> 00:28:32.805
who are involved in sport.

00:28:32.805 --> 00:28:35.850
And listen, I've frequently
said my children--

00:28:35.850 --> 00:28:38.940
daughter, two sons-- all of
whom play sports at the youth

00:28:38.940 --> 00:28:39.570
level--

00:28:39.570 --> 00:28:43.100
they'll learn more
watching the Broncos play

00:28:43.100 --> 00:28:44.940
and seeing Peyton
Manning and how

00:28:44.940 --> 00:28:47.700
he acts off the field than
they'll ever learn from me.

00:28:47.700 --> 00:28:49.290
But the reality is,
they're probably

00:28:49.290 --> 00:28:51.180
learning more from
the coach that they

00:28:51.180 --> 00:28:55.300
spend quite a bit of time
with on a day-to-day basis.

00:28:55.300 --> 00:28:57.780
And the fact that there's
no national coaching

00:28:57.780 --> 00:29:00.720
accreditation, certification--
you've seen some of the recent

00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:03.480
news on the sexual abuse--

00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:07.030
it just simply has to be dealt
with in a more effective way.

00:29:07.030 --> 00:29:10.917
2/3 of America agrees
that sport over-emphasizes

00:29:10.917 --> 00:29:12.000
the importance of winning.

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:14.935
And I have just
two quick graphs.

00:29:14.935 --> 00:29:16.560
And I know that might
be tough to read.

00:29:16.560 --> 00:29:19.050
And I don't want you to try to
read all that in the short time

00:29:19.050 --> 00:29:19.591
that we have.

00:29:19.591 --> 00:29:21.900
But at the top,
this is a question

00:29:21.900 --> 00:29:25.690
from the survey that asks
those that took the survey--

00:29:25.690 --> 00:29:29.790
and over 6,000 people, it
was done through an IRB,

00:29:29.790 --> 00:29:34.320
robustly put together-- what
values, as a participant

00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:36.930
in sport, do you want to see?

00:29:36.930 --> 00:29:39.600
And I think it's,
if you can see--

00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:42.930
so this is what people
want out of sport, OK.

00:29:42.930 --> 00:29:45.410
Honesty, that's a
value they want taught.

00:29:45.410 --> 00:29:48.450
Fair play, this is in
order of importance

00:29:48.450 --> 00:29:50.250
to those that were surveyed.

00:29:50.250 --> 00:29:52.650
I think you see in
one of the main points

00:29:52.650 --> 00:29:55.470
is down here at the bottom,
winning and competitiveness.

00:29:55.470 --> 00:29:59.760
And by no means am I saying we
don't want to be competitive.

00:29:59.760 --> 00:30:01.770
We just have to be
realistic about what are we

00:30:01.770 --> 00:30:03.780
willing to do in order to win.

00:30:03.780 --> 00:30:07.380
And "win at all costs"
culture is a real, live issue,

00:30:07.380 --> 00:30:09.450
all the way down to
our youth sports.

00:30:09.450 --> 00:30:13.160
So, when you then
ask the question,

00:30:13.160 --> 00:30:17.060
what is sport
actually reinforcing?

00:30:17.060 --> 00:30:19.160
Not that it's completely
turned on its head,

00:30:19.160 --> 00:30:22.870
but you see a pretty
dramatic difference

00:30:22.870 --> 00:30:26.750
in what sport, at least what
the perceptions are from parents

00:30:26.750 --> 00:30:30.740
and others who were
involved with this research,

00:30:30.740 --> 00:30:33.250
competitive winning
is at the top.

00:30:33.250 --> 00:30:36.140
And I think it's no
wonder we're seeing

00:30:36.140 --> 00:30:38.960
some of the manifestations
of that culture,

00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:40.340
as Brian described.

00:30:40.340 --> 00:30:43.760
But you also see a big drop
off from kids playing sport

00:30:43.760 --> 00:30:48.170
at that 12- to 14-year-old
level because it's simply not

00:30:48.170 --> 00:30:48.884
fun anymore.

00:30:48.884 --> 00:30:50.300
And they don't
like what they have

00:30:50.300 --> 00:30:54.950
to do-- the specialization, the
professionalization, and what

00:30:54.950 --> 00:30:56.840
they have to do
in order to please

00:30:56.840 --> 00:30:59.010
the number 1 influence in
their life, their coach,

00:30:59.010 --> 00:31:01.650
is just simply not
fun for them anymore.

00:31:01.650 --> 00:31:03.900
We've tried to address
it through a program--

00:31:03.900 --> 00:31:04.462
TrueSport.

00:31:04.462 --> 00:31:06.920
I'd encourage you, if you're
interested, please go and take

00:31:06.920 --> 00:31:08.690
a look at it.

00:31:08.690 --> 00:31:13.610
I think we would be remiss if
we didn't at least acknowledge

00:31:13.610 --> 00:31:14.630
this issue.

00:31:14.630 --> 00:31:19.860
And I heard earlier about the
"head in the sand," I think,

00:31:19.860 --> 00:31:21.280
or the "elephant in the room."

00:31:21.280 --> 00:31:24.020
We might describe this one
as the "head in the sand"

00:31:24.020 --> 00:31:26.150
if we don't address it.

00:31:26.150 --> 00:31:28.250
Because sport is addressing it.

00:31:28.250 --> 00:31:29.750
And I want to be
really clear, these

00:31:29.750 --> 00:31:32.420
are not issues that we deal
with on a day-to-day basis.

00:31:32.420 --> 00:31:34.670
And I'm certainly
not the expert on it.

00:31:34.670 --> 00:31:39.200
But I think this conference
should examine these issues.

00:31:39.200 --> 00:31:44.300
I think sport has to deal with
it in a fair, objective way

00:31:44.300 --> 00:31:49.520
to ensure that all athletes'
rights are protected in the way

00:31:49.520 --> 00:31:50.930
that they should be protected.

00:31:50.930 --> 00:31:53.420
You know, frankly, if
you follow these cases--

00:31:53.420 --> 00:31:58.190
and there were very popular
in the headlines in 2012

00:31:58.190 --> 00:32:00.860
for the Games, in
2016 for the Games--

00:32:00.860 --> 00:32:04.400
I think it should
break all of our hearts

00:32:04.400 --> 00:32:06.590
to see how some of these
individual athletes

00:32:06.590 --> 00:32:08.630
have been treated
and humiliated.

00:32:08.630 --> 00:32:12.320
And I think we should all
take steps to ensure best

00:32:12.320 --> 00:32:14.340
practices and policies
that are in place, so

00:32:14.340 --> 00:32:16.010
that individual
athletes don't have

00:32:16.010 --> 00:32:18.290
to go through the
type of humiliation

00:32:18.290 --> 00:32:19.670
that some have
had to go through.

00:32:19.670 --> 00:32:21.860
I think, good for these
athletes, frankly,

00:32:21.860 --> 00:32:25.670
for not backing down, and
being tough to push back

00:32:25.670 --> 00:32:28.820
on that potential humiliation
and things that otherwise might

00:32:28.820 --> 00:32:32.780
cause people to cower away,
and truly be role models for us

00:32:32.780 --> 00:32:33.290
all.

00:32:33.290 --> 00:32:37.610
And listen, the rules are
set by the sport federations.

00:32:37.610 --> 00:32:40.580
I think it's fair to say they've
done a very poor job in even

00:32:40.580 --> 00:32:43.520
attempting to get their
arms around these issues.

00:32:43.520 --> 00:32:46.730
The IOC has put out a policy--

00:32:46.730 --> 00:32:53.060
it passes, or punts, on
the inter-sex question

00:32:53.060 --> 00:32:55.880
until sometime,
probably this summer.

00:32:55.880 --> 00:32:57.680
So I'd encourage you,
if you're following

00:32:57.680 --> 00:33:00.140
these issues, to pay attention.

00:33:00.140 --> 00:33:03.530
What ultimately will happen
on the gender question,

00:33:03.530 --> 00:33:06.970
whether a transitioning
athlete can participate,

00:33:06.970 --> 00:33:08.990
those rules are
pretty well-developed.

00:33:08.990 --> 00:33:12.410
The one area where that
touches anti-doping

00:33:12.410 --> 00:33:16.070
is where you have a
transitioning female who

00:33:16.070 --> 00:33:21.800
wants to compete, can compete
as a man under the IOC policy.

00:33:21.800 --> 00:33:24.740
Frequently that
transition will require

00:33:24.740 --> 00:33:27.950
the use of testosterone,
which as I've said previously,

00:33:27.950 --> 00:33:30.794
is a violation, potentially,
of the anti-doping rules.

00:33:30.794 --> 00:33:32.210
Fortunately, the
anti-doping rules

00:33:32.210 --> 00:33:34.220
have a process to
deal with that.

00:33:34.220 --> 00:33:36.500
We've had two
cases where someone

00:33:36.500 --> 00:33:39.380
in a transitioning
environment has a decision,

00:33:39.380 --> 00:33:43.250
has come forward and
disclosed, and since disclosure

00:33:43.250 --> 00:33:45.560
received permission to
use that testosterone.

00:33:45.560 --> 00:33:47.360
So, I think the
anti-doping rules

00:33:47.360 --> 00:33:52.740
where it interfaces slightly
deals with it directly

00:33:52.740 --> 00:33:53.720
in a very robust way.

00:33:53.720 --> 00:33:56.000
But happy to talk about
that more as we can.

00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:59.620
Lastly, let me end with
just a quick video,

00:33:59.620 --> 00:34:01.410
and it may go one minute over.

00:34:01.410 --> 00:34:03.890
I'm not sure what the
opportunity for women

00:34:03.890 --> 00:34:05.840
to compete in Russia is.

00:34:05.840 --> 00:34:07.100
Honestly, I don't know.

00:34:07.100 --> 00:34:08.540
It's a really
fascinating question

00:34:08.540 --> 00:34:11.870
that I ask myself after
hearing the first panel.

00:34:11.870 --> 00:34:16.010
My guess is they don't have
a Title 9-type provision that

00:34:16.010 --> 00:34:17.899
gives the same
opportunities that we

00:34:17.899 --> 00:34:19.190
have here in the United States.

00:34:19.190 --> 00:34:22.909
But thank goodness
this particular woman

00:34:22.909 --> 00:34:27.417
competed in Russia and rose
to the elite level ranks.

00:34:27.417 --> 00:34:29.000
Some of you may have
heard this story,

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:31.280
but it's the Russian
whistle-blower, a female.

00:34:31.280 --> 00:34:35.570
She was named BBC Most
Influential Woman in the World,

00:34:35.570 --> 00:34:38.120
and I think you'll find her
story compelling of what

00:34:38.120 --> 00:34:39.922
good women can do when
they do participate.

00:34:39.922 --> 00:34:41.380
Let's see if we
can get us to work.

00:34:45.489 --> 00:34:48.256

00:37:42.697 --> 00:37:43.280
[END PLAYBACK]

00:37:43.280 --> 00:37:46.110
Incredible courage that
this female competitor has

00:37:46.110 --> 00:37:48.570
showed for the good of
athletes around the world,

00:37:48.570 --> 00:37:50.480
including many here
in the United States.

00:37:50.480 --> 00:37:51.952
Thank you for your attention.

00:37:51.952 --> 00:37:55.326
[APPLAUSE]

00:37:58.220 --> 00:38:00.430
- Good morning.

00:38:00.430 --> 00:38:03.250
I would like to first
start by recognizing

00:38:03.250 --> 00:38:07.060
that we're gathered today on the
traditional lands of a number

00:38:07.060 --> 00:38:08.680
of different
indigenous communities

00:38:08.680 --> 00:38:12.250
and that I am grateful for this
opportunity to work on this.

00:38:12.250 --> 00:38:15.400
Land I'd also like
to add my thanks

00:38:15.400 --> 00:38:18.040
to Dean Cohen and all the
members of the planning

00:38:18.040 --> 00:38:22.150
committee for, first of
all, this tremendous event

00:38:22.150 --> 00:38:24.950
and for inviting me
to be part of it.

00:38:24.950 --> 00:38:30.380
Now, we're going to go into
far different direction

00:38:30.380 --> 00:38:33.200
than what my co-panelists
have initiated

00:38:33.200 --> 00:38:35.330
in this particular
session, as I will

00:38:35.330 --> 00:38:39.200
be focusing on gender health and
community or grassroots sport.

00:38:39.200 --> 00:38:40.790
I'm also, I think,
representing--

00:38:40.790 --> 00:38:43.280
the only representative
of Canada here.

00:38:43.280 --> 00:38:45.290
So, we'll be going
international a little bit.

00:38:45.290 --> 00:38:49.710
Now, because I am the last
panelist before lunch,

00:38:49.710 --> 00:38:53.030
I'm just going to go straight to
the key points here of my talk.

00:38:53.030 --> 00:38:54.404
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:57.610 --> 00:39:01.010
Health is a political issue and
a right of social citizenship.

00:39:01.010 --> 00:39:03.790
These are the key points that
I will be coming through,

00:39:03.790 --> 00:39:05.440
throughout my entire talk.

00:39:05.440 --> 00:39:07.690
Two, that access to
equitable community sport

00:39:07.690 --> 00:39:11.170
is an access-to-health issue
in that the negative health

00:39:11.170 --> 00:39:16.180
consequences of inaccessible
and inequitable community sport

00:39:16.180 --> 00:39:19.390
is far more substantial for
vulnerable and marginalized

00:39:19.390 --> 00:39:21.790
individuals and groups, in
particular low-income girls

00:39:21.790 --> 00:39:23.110
and women.

00:39:23.110 --> 00:39:26.650
I suspect-- I hope that
these points may seem

00:39:26.650 --> 00:39:28.270
obvious to most of us here.

00:39:28.270 --> 00:39:31.210
But if not, I will unpack each.

00:39:31.210 --> 00:39:35.380
In Canada, as in many
other neoliberal regimes,

00:39:35.380 --> 00:39:38.380
preoccupations with
individualized and behavioral

00:39:38.380 --> 00:39:41.410
approaches to disease
prevention prevail.

00:39:41.410 --> 00:39:44.470
And they in fact act as barriers
to more critical conversations

00:39:44.470 --> 00:39:48.430
about our health,
despite the fact

00:39:48.430 --> 00:39:52.540
that there's a tremendous
amount of evidence

00:39:52.540 --> 00:39:55.030
of the social
determinants of health.

00:39:55.030 --> 00:39:57.520
And a key question
then becomes, how do we

00:39:57.520 --> 00:40:01.060
go past our fixation
on our waistlines?

00:40:01.060 --> 00:40:03.520
How do we go past these
behavioral approaches

00:40:03.520 --> 00:40:07.090
to think more concretely
about health and health care?

00:40:07.090 --> 00:40:09.880
Certainly, raising
awareness of health

00:40:09.880 --> 00:40:13.360
as a political phenomenon
is one approach.

00:40:13.360 --> 00:40:15.730
And to this end, Bambra
et al.'s explication

00:40:15.730 --> 00:40:18.950
of the political nature
of health is quite useful.

00:40:18.950 --> 00:40:20.920
These are folks from the UK.

00:40:20.920 --> 00:40:23.440
This is how they define the
political nature of health.

00:40:23.440 --> 00:40:27.970
Health is political because some
social groups have more of it

00:40:27.970 --> 00:40:28.820
than others.

00:40:28.820 --> 00:40:32.030
It's a resource that some
enjoy more so than others.

00:40:32.030 --> 00:40:33.850
Its social determinants
are amenable

00:40:33.850 --> 00:40:36.550
to political intervention
and political action--

00:40:36.550 --> 00:40:39.040
more often than not,
political inaction.

00:40:39.040 --> 00:40:41.560
And health is political
because the right

00:40:41.560 --> 00:40:43.630
to a standard of
living and well-being

00:40:43.630 --> 00:40:46.960
is or should be a
right of citizenship

00:40:46.960 --> 00:40:49.000
and a human right--
something that was raised

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:52.590
in the first panel session.

00:40:52.590 --> 00:40:55.320
In this conceptualisation,
health is not simply

00:40:55.320 --> 00:40:58.110
about our genetics,
or our lifestyles,

00:40:58.110 --> 00:40:59.910
or our medical systems.

00:40:59.910 --> 00:41:02.490
It's not about how
long is the wait

00:41:02.490 --> 00:41:06.090
time for a particular procedure
or who's going to pay for it.

00:41:06.090 --> 00:41:10.500
Those downstream-type
questions and the debates

00:41:10.500 --> 00:41:12.960
that they engender
are critical, yes.

00:41:12.960 --> 00:41:15.600
But they also keep the
priority on this very

00:41:15.600 --> 00:41:18.270
individualized and medicalized
approach to health.

00:41:18.270 --> 00:41:21.720
Rather, this
conceptualization here

00:41:21.720 --> 00:41:23.760
sees health as
fundamentally linked

00:41:23.760 --> 00:41:27.450
to power and to the distribution
of resources in our lives,

00:41:27.450 --> 00:41:31.590
as well as also to the quality
of the social relations

00:41:31.590 --> 00:41:33.690
within our communities.

00:41:33.690 --> 00:41:35.940
And this third point
clearly emphasizes

00:41:35.940 --> 00:41:38.700
that health is a right of
social citizenship, which

00:41:38.700 --> 00:41:43.830
refers to a right of us
to share fully in life.

00:41:43.830 --> 00:41:46.170
To go beyond just
economic welfare,

00:41:46.170 --> 00:41:50.130
but to be able to participate
in life fulsomely and robustly.

00:41:50.130 --> 00:41:52.590
Whereas civil and
political rights protect us

00:41:52.590 --> 00:41:55.170
from unwarranted
interference from others,

00:41:55.170 --> 00:41:57.240
a person's social
right of citizenship

00:41:57.240 --> 00:42:00.120
emphasizes equality,
a sense of solidarity,

00:42:00.120 --> 00:42:02.130
and mutual dependency.

00:42:02.130 --> 00:42:06.420
So, this emphasis on
collectivity and community

00:42:06.420 --> 00:42:08.220
leads to my second
point, that access

00:42:08.220 --> 00:42:10.500
to equitable,
community-based support

00:42:10.500 --> 00:42:12.690
is an access-to-health issue.

00:42:12.690 --> 00:42:15.690
Let me offer you two very
well-established facts.

00:42:15.690 --> 00:42:18.090
The first is that social
cohesion and social

00:42:18.090 --> 00:42:21.240
connectedness-- some of us may
use the term "social capital,"

00:42:21.240 --> 00:42:23.490
it depends on us--

00:42:23.490 --> 00:42:25.830
but social cohesion,
social connectedness

00:42:25.830 --> 00:42:28.110
has profound implication
on our health.

00:42:28.110 --> 00:42:30.450
The greater our sense of
connection with one another,

00:42:30.450 --> 00:42:32.340
the greater our sense
of compassion for one

00:42:32.340 --> 00:42:35.160
another, the more we trust
in one another, and engage

00:42:35.160 --> 00:42:38.250
in one another, the healthier
we are, the happier that we are.

00:42:38.250 --> 00:42:41.430
The World Health Report
2017 came out two weeks ago.

00:42:41.430 --> 00:42:43.800
The Scandinavian countries
are back up at the top

00:42:43.800 --> 00:42:44.970
again, right.

00:42:44.970 --> 00:42:46.380
And why is that?

00:42:46.380 --> 00:42:48.780
Because of, well the
Danes have a concept,

00:42:48.780 --> 00:42:50.066
they call it "hygge."

00:42:50.066 --> 00:42:51.690
I don't know if anyone
is Danish here--

00:42:51.690 --> 00:42:52.920
forgive me for my Danish.

00:42:52.920 --> 00:42:54.780
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:54.780 --> 00:42:56.910
What it means, it
translates to "coziness"--

00:42:56.910 --> 00:42:58.867
this element of coziness
in their communities.

00:42:58.867 --> 00:43:01.200
That's one of the reasons why
they rank at the top, year

00:43:01.200 --> 00:43:02.850
after year.

00:43:02.850 --> 00:43:03.750
The reverse is true.

00:43:03.750 --> 00:43:05.820
The greater the sense
of social isolation

00:43:05.820 --> 00:43:09.690
and social polarization,
the greater our illness,

00:43:09.690 --> 00:43:11.730
greater our injury
and ill health.

00:43:11.730 --> 00:43:14.612
This is one of the core things
that we're finding with regards

00:43:14.612 --> 00:43:17.070
to, let's say, the opioid crisis
that's happening in the US

00:43:17.070 --> 00:43:19.120
and across Canada.

00:43:19.120 --> 00:43:21.720
The second fact is that,
when done well and equitably,

00:43:21.720 --> 00:43:24.720
community sport fosters social
connectedness and belonging.

00:43:24.720 --> 00:43:28.530
I want to emphasize what I
said there-- when done well.

00:43:28.530 --> 00:43:30.720
In its best moments,
community sport

00:43:30.720 --> 00:43:33.270
is a site where one can
share fully in social life.

00:43:33.270 --> 00:43:35.670
It's inclusive and integrative.

00:43:35.670 --> 00:43:39.840
It is a resource that, when done
well, can boost health, right.

00:43:39.840 --> 00:43:42.860
And so, therefore,
access to community sport

00:43:42.860 --> 00:43:45.180
is an access-to-health issue.

00:43:45.180 --> 00:43:48.000
And yet, the provision and
delivery of community sport

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:50.210
is more often than not quite
disconnected from health

00:43:50.210 --> 00:43:51.210
and health care systems.

00:43:51.210 --> 00:43:54.210
In the city of Toronto,
Parks, Forestry &amp; Recreation,

00:43:54.210 --> 00:43:56.010
which is the
division responsible

00:43:56.010 --> 00:43:59.100
for publicly-funded,
publicly-accessible community

00:43:59.100 --> 00:44:01.710
sport, that which is
available to Torontonians--

00:44:01.710 --> 00:44:04.200
it's completely separated
from public health,

00:44:04.200 --> 00:44:05.940
the Department of Public Health.

00:44:05.940 --> 00:44:09.000
It's completely separated
also from Children's Services,

00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:11.710
Economic Development
&amp; Culture, Equity,

00:44:11.710 --> 00:44:14.100
Diversity, and Human
Rights, Shelter, Support

00:44:14.100 --> 00:44:17.650
&amp; Housing, and Social
Development, et cetera.

00:44:17.650 --> 00:44:20.010
In other words, in
the siloization--

00:44:20.010 --> 00:44:21.060
which is a word--

00:44:21.060 --> 00:44:23.070
in the siloization
of governance,

00:44:23.070 --> 00:44:26.040
community sport gets
isolated into one department

00:44:26.040 --> 00:44:28.680
with very little dialogue
or sustained conversation

00:44:28.680 --> 00:44:30.600
between these departments.

00:44:30.600 --> 00:44:32.310
This compartmentalization
is matched

00:44:32.310 --> 00:44:34.500
by the too-common relegation
of community sport

00:44:34.500 --> 00:44:38.170
as just a frill, or just
fun and games for the kids.

00:44:38.170 --> 00:44:40.680
And we hear this narrative
by civic leaders,

00:44:40.680 --> 00:44:43.440
but also from community
residents too.

00:44:43.440 --> 00:44:45.570
Outside of those occasions
when a major sporting

00:44:45.570 --> 00:44:49.140
event is being hosted, with all
of the politics that happens

00:44:49.140 --> 00:44:51.570
and the fanfare, rarely is
the provision and delivery

00:44:51.570 --> 00:44:53.790
of community sport
discussed or debated

00:44:53.790 --> 00:44:57.060
with the same visibility
and sustained sort of energy

00:44:57.060 --> 00:44:59.850
as, let's say, budgets,
property taxes,

00:44:59.850 --> 00:45:02.640
police-community relations,
infrastructure troubles,

00:45:02.640 --> 00:45:04.260
or public transit.

00:45:04.260 --> 00:45:06.840
Of course, those
issues are critical.

00:45:06.840 --> 00:45:09.570
But the near-complete
silence or the dismissal--

00:45:09.570 --> 00:45:11.850
outright dismissal
of community sport

00:45:11.850 --> 00:45:14.130
as just not as
important as whatever

00:45:14.130 --> 00:45:19.210
XYZ is very problematic,
given its health consequences.

00:45:19.210 --> 00:45:21.690
This is particularly the case
in this contemporary moment

00:45:21.690 --> 00:45:25.640
in time when public sectors
are being hollowed out

00:45:25.640 --> 00:45:27.530
and when community
sport programs are often

00:45:27.530 --> 00:45:30.860
the first to be sacrificed in
the name of cost containment.

00:45:30.860 --> 00:45:32.900
Closing an outdoor hockey rink--

00:45:32.900 --> 00:45:36.982
ice hockey rink-- may seem
the lesser of two evils when

00:45:36.982 --> 00:45:38.690
compared to cutting
funding for community

00:45:38.690 --> 00:45:40.730
housing or public transit.

00:45:40.730 --> 00:45:43.880
But for the more vulnerable
groups in our communities,

00:45:43.880 --> 00:45:46.520
those resources--
community sport resources--

00:45:46.520 --> 00:45:48.530
are just as necessary
and meaningful

00:45:48.530 --> 00:45:50.390
as shelter and transit.

00:45:50.390 --> 00:45:51.170
Why?

00:45:51.170 --> 00:45:54.620
Because they offer spaces
and places to get beyond,

00:45:54.620 --> 00:45:58.220
even if just momentarily,
the stark challenges of life.

00:45:58.220 --> 00:46:01.430
These are the spaces and
places where people connect,

00:46:01.430 --> 00:46:03.440
where they get relief--

00:46:03.440 --> 00:46:06.830
stress relief, where
they have pleasure,

00:46:06.830 --> 00:46:09.847
where they attend to
health and well-being.

00:46:09.847 --> 00:46:11.430
Then this leads to
my third key point.

00:46:11.430 --> 00:46:14.690
The reduction of public services
has impact on all of us,

00:46:14.690 --> 00:46:17.510
but has heightened consequence
for those who are vulnerable.

00:46:17.510 --> 00:46:21.650
And low-income girls and women
are one such vulnerable group.

00:46:21.650 --> 00:46:23.270
Even though the
data that we have

00:46:23.270 --> 00:46:26.320
on sport participation, at least
in Canada, is quite imprecise,

00:46:26.320 --> 00:46:28.430
there is consistent
empirical evidence

00:46:28.430 --> 00:46:30.710
that the rate of participation
among girls and women

00:46:30.710 --> 00:46:33.000
is consistently less
than boys and men.

00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:35.210
And that the trend or the
gap is more pronounced

00:46:35.210 --> 00:46:38.930
as you go up the
socioeconomic ladder--

00:46:38.930 --> 00:46:40.730
or should go down, I should say.

00:46:40.730 --> 00:46:45.090
Low-income girls and
women disproportionately

00:46:45.090 --> 00:46:47.460
bear the burden of
inaccessible community sport.

00:46:47.460 --> 00:46:50.000
While the fight for
gender equality continues,

00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:52.110
sport still remains a
school for masculinity.

00:46:52.110 --> 00:46:55.050
And a majority of community
resources still go

00:46:55.050 --> 00:46:57.290
to boys' and men's sport,
helping to reproduce

00:46:57.290 --> 00:46:59.790
the likelihood that boys are
more likely to participate than

00:46:59.790 --> 00:47:00.867
girls.

00:47:00.867 --> 00:47:02.450
And this becomes
even more complicated

00:47:02.450 --> 00:47:05.550
when we go back to the issue of
the closure of community spaces

00:47:05.550 --> 00:47:07.710
and places, like a
hockey rink, right.

00:47:07.710 --> 00:47:09.480
For families with
the financial means,

00:47:09.480 --> 00:47:12.330
the loss of that
neighborhood hockey rink

00:47:12.330 --> 00:47:14.211
can be managed,
can be mitigated.

00:47:14.211 --> 00:47:15.960
They have the means
with which to then get

00:47:15.960 --> 00:47:19.650
their sons and daughters into
a private sport club, right.

00:47:19.650 --> 00:47:22.410
But for low-income families,
the evidence suggests that once

00:47:22.410 --> 00:47:24.570
those community
spaces are closed,

00:47:24.570 --> 00:47:27.270
it is the son's participation
that gets more supported than

00:47:27.270 --> 00:47:28.260
the daughter's.

00:47:28.260 --> 00:47:30.420
Now, these are not
cruel families.

00:47:30.420 --> 00:47:32.550
These are folks who are
living in very precarious

00:47:32.550 --> 00:47:34.125
financial situations.

00:47:34.125 --> 00:47:36.000
And these are folks who,
more often than not,

00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:38.370
have quite different
ingrained perceptions

00:47:38.370 --> 00:47:41.700
about the value of sports
for girls and women,

00:47:41.700 --> 00:47:45.150
as compared to boys and men.

00:47:45.150 --> 00:47:48.630
In other words, even the
meaning of sport participation

00:47:48.630 --> 00:47:50.850
is different as you travel
down the social gradient.

00:47:50.850 --> 00:47:52.620
And to use the most
Canadian of examples,

00:47:52.620 --> 00:47:55.350
we know that Canadian girls
playing ice hockey-- again,

00:47:55.350 --> 00:47:57.070
I come back to like ice hockey.

00:47:57.070 --> 00:47:58.269
I was a rugby player.

00:47:58.269 --> 00:48:00.060
I don't even know how
to skate, but anyway.

00:48:00.060 --> 00:48:00.780
[LAUGHTER]

00:48:00.780 --> 00:48:04.170
We know that Canadian girls
who are playing ice hockey

00:48:04.170 --> 00:48:07.710
tend to have parents who have
higher socioeconomic status.

00:48:07.710 --> 00:48:11.097
Not only do these parents
have greater economic capital,

00:48:11.097 --> 00:48:12.930
but they tend to offer
greater encouragement

00:48:12.930 --> 00:48:15.390
for their daughters to break
out of traditional gender

00:48:15.390 --> 00:48:16.410
boundaries.

00:48:16.410 --> 00:48:18.900
For them, it is much
more organic a thought

00:48:18.900 --> 00:48:21.869
that, if my son can do
it, my daughter can do it.

00:48:21.869 --> 00:48:23.910
What we know is that when
you go to the other end

00:48:23.910 --> 00:48:26.670
of the socioeconomic spectrum,
the meaningfulness of sport

00:48:26.670 --> 00:48:29.220
changes, as well
as the exposure to,

00:48:29.220 --> 00:48:32.142
the competence in,
and the access, right.

00:48:32.142 --> 00:48:34.350
And this is some information
coming out of colleagues

00:48:34.350 --> 00:48:36.870
from the UK, Jay
Coakley and Anita White.

00:48:36.870 --> 00:48:39.450
This is not just about
children and youth.

00:48:39.450 --> 00:48:41.100
The hollowing out
of the public sector

00:48:41.100 --> 00:48:43.080
contributes to the
inaccessibility of community

00:48:43.080 --> 00:48:45.930
sport for women of all ages.

00:48:45.930 --> 00:48:47.850
This is a quote
from a participant,

00:48:47.850 --> 00:48:50.700
a woman that I spoke to from a
study I did a number of years

00:48:50.700 --> 00:48:53.400
ago, living in one of Toronto's
high-risk neighborhoods--

00:48:53.400 --> 00:48:56.190
"high-risk" being code
for very racialized--

00:48:56.190 --> 00:48:59.430
high number of immigrants,
low socioeconomic status.

00:48:59.430 --> 00:49:02.646
She was from Sri Lanka, living
in a high-rise department.

00:49:02.646 --> 00:49:04.020
The city of Toronto,
because they

00:49:04.020 --> 00:49:05.730
needed to shrink
the budget, decided

00:49:05.730 --> 00:49:08.970
that they wouldn't be shoveling
the sidewalks as often

00:49:08.970 --> 00:49:10.477
when there was snowfall.

00:49:10.477 --> 00:49:12.810
And she said, "When the City
decides to no longer shovel

00:49:12.810 --> 00:49:14.970
the sidewalk around
my building, how

00:49:14.970 --> 00:49:17.040
can my mother and I
go for a daily walk

00:49:17.040 --> 00:49:20.289
when that's all I can afford?"

00:49:20.289 --> 00:49:22.455
We're so good about preaching
health promotion-- you

00:49:22.455 --> 00:49:25.300
know, be physically active, it's
good for you, da, da, da, da,

00:49:25.300 --> 00:49:25.800
da.

00:49:25.800 --> 00:49:29.100
This woman knows physical
activity as good for her.

00:49:29.100 --> 00:49:32.430
What this is, is commentary on
some of the systemic barriers

00:49:32.430 --> 00:49:34.380
she's facing, right.

00:49:34.380 --> 00:49:37.090
And if we had time to go into
the complexities of gender,

00:49:37.090 --> 00:49:39.360
ethnicity, health,
and community sport,

00:49:39.360 --> 00:49:42.090
we would see the marking
of racialized difference

00:49:42.090 --> 00:49:45.510
and otherness entwined
with material conditions,

00:49:45.510 --> 00:49:48.520
such that struggles around the
politics of identity cohere

00:49:48.520 --> 00:49:52.140
through processes, as much
economic as ethnocultural.

00:49:52.140 --> 00:49:55.600
Still to this day in Canada,
it is recent women immigrants

00:49:55.600 --> 00:49:57.750
who are probably at
the lowest levels

00:49:57.750 --> 00:49:59.970
of the socioeconomic ladder.

00:49:59.970 --> 00:50:02.640
They are still-- even
though their education rates

00:50:02.640 --> 00:50:05.910
are higher, greater than ever
because of Canada's immigration

00:50:05.910 --> 00:50:08.460
system, they are earning
a fraction of what

00:50:08.460 --> 00:50:11.220
Canadian-born women are earning.

00:50:11.220 --> 00:50:13.350
And Canadian-born women
are earning a fraction

00:50:13.350 --> 00:50:15.250
of what men are earning.

00:50:15.250 --> 00:50:17.250
Again, where does community
sport fit into this?

00:50:17.250 --> 00:50:20.490
Now, I don't want to end
my talk with doom and gloom

00:50:20.490 --> 00:50:24.349
because I'm just
before lunch, right.

00:50:24.349 --> 00:50:25.890
Because there is
also good news here.

00:50:25.890 --> 00:50:28.015
There are some incredibly
innovative and thoughtful

00:50:28.015 --> 00:50:30.120
programs out there,
all across Canada,

00:50:30.120 --> 00:50:32.880
and I suspect across
the US, too, as well as

00:50:32.880 --> 00:50:34.950
other parts of the
world, that are trying

00:50:34.950 --> 00:50:38.560
to prioritize accessibility
and equity for low-income girls

00:50:38.560 --> 00:50:39.060
and women.

00:50:39.060 --> 00:50:40.685
So what are the common
characteristics?

00:50:40.685 --> 00:50:42.119
I'm only going to highlight two.

00:50:42.119 --> 00:50:44.160
There's challenges, I can
address that afterwards

00:50:44.160 --> 00:50:46.020
if anyone's interested.

00:50:46.020 --> 00:50:49.140
One is that they
take into account

00:50:49.140 --> 00:50:51.450
a priori that low-income
girls and women may

00:50:51.450 --> 00:50:54.210
have different prerequisites
for participation.

00:50:54.210 --> 00:50:57.180
And they factor in those
different participation

00:50:57.180 --> 00:50:59.190
prerequisites into the
design and the delivery

00:50:59.190 --> 00:51:00.960
of the program.

00:51:00.960 --> 00:51:05.040
The other one is that they
ensure that key individuals are

00:51:05.040 --> 00:51:06.330
at the decision-making table.

00:51:06.330 --> 00:51:08.100
They ensure
representational access.

00:51:08.100 --> 00:51:09.620
Who are the key individuals?

00:51:09.620 --> 00:51:12.240
The low-income girls
and women themselves.

00:51:12.240 --> 00:51:15.630
That they are there to inform
how different programs get

00:51:15.630 --> 00:51:17.460
developed and then delivered.

00:51:17.460 --> 00:51:21.780
So for example, in British
Columbia a number of years ago,

00:51:21.780 --> 00:51:23.562
city officials,
program developers,

00:51:23.562 --> 00:51:25.770
and academics from the
University of British Columbia

00:51:25.770 --> 00:51:27.330
gathered together
because they wanted

00:51:27.330 --> 00:51:29.280
to develop a program
that would ameliorate

00:51:29.280 --> 00:51:31.860
the conditions for low-income
girls and women living

00:51:31.860 --> 00:51:33.630
in some parts of the city.

00:51:33.630 --> 00:51:35.280
And it was a flop.

00:51:35.280 --> 00:51:37.440
They went to the girls and
women in the community,

00:51:37.440 --> 00:51:39.150
and they said, please
come to the table.

00:51:39.150 --> 00:51:40.680
It was women, in
fact, excuse me.

00:51:40.680 --> 00:51:43.530
They said, please tell us,
let us know what's going on.

00:51:43.530 --> 00:51:46.530
The women came to the
decision-making table and said,

00:51:46.530 --> 00:51:48.380
we have children.

00:51:48.380 --> 00:51:50.570
Two things-- we don't
have money for childcare,

00:51:50.570 --> 00:51:52.820
and the other thing is
if our children can't

00:51:52.820 --> 00:51:55.250
find opportunities
to play sport,

00:51:55.250 --> 00:51:57.350
we're not going to
engage in sport.

00:51:57.350 --> 00:51:59.120
The program revamped.

00:51:59.120 --> 00:52:00.950
And they developed
free childcare

00:52:00.950 --> 00:52:05.270
for the women, free sport
programs for the children,

00:52:05.270 --> 00:52:06.920
and it was a huge success.

00:52:06.920 --> 00:52:09.926
And the women said, we know
that we were socially isolated.

00:52:09.926 --> 00:52:11.300
We know this is
going to help us.

00:52:11.300 --> 00:52:13.640
And thank you for
hearing our voices.

00:52:13.640 --> 00:52:15.590
In a Toronto-based
program, it was in fact

00:52:15.590 --> 00:52:17.750
a group of Somalian
recent immigrants,

00:52:17.750 --> 00:52:19.580
women who came to the city.

00:52:19.580 --> 00:52:21.470
And they said, hey,
city of Toronto,

00:52:21.470 --> 00:52:23.840
we want to engage in sport.

00:52:23.840 --> 00:52:26.000
By the way, we want to
engage in field hockey.

00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:28.790
Why they chose field
hockey, I don't know.

00:52:28.790 --> 00:52:30.440
They said, we will
bring the women

00:52:30.440 --> 00:52:33.320
if you can attend to our
participation prerequisites.

00:52:33.320 --> 00:52:36.260
We need a space where
there is security,

00:52:36.260 --> 00:52:39.760
so that we can learn,
train, and figure out

00:52:39.760 --> 00:52:41.720
field hockey in private.

00:52:41.720 --> 00:52:43.730
And we need a female coach.

00:52:43.730 --> 00:52:45.470
City of Toronto said yes.

00:52:45.470 --> 00:52:48.380
So, here we have
bottom-up approaches.

00:52:48.380 --> 00:52:51.710
And what that ends up doing is
it breaks a very vicious cycle.

00:52:51.710 --> 00:52:54.200
Most community-sport
providers still

00:52:54.200 --> 00:52:59.060
believe that if you
build it, they will come.

00:52:59.060 --> 00:53:02.300
So, they develop a program
that's not informed.

00:53:02.300 --> 00:53:04.880
It fails to take in the material
conditions of these women's

00:53:04.880 --> 00:53:06.410
lives into account.

00:53:06.410 --> 00:53:08.630
The women don't participate.

00:53:08.630 --> 00:53:11.510
Then the program
officials blame the women

00:53:11.510 --> 00:53:13.767
for not taking advantage
of the opportunity.

00:53:13.767 --> 00:53:15.350
And then some
stereotypes keep getting

00:53:15.350 --> 00:53:18.050
reproduced-- the
apathetic poor person,

00:53:18.050 --> 00:53:21.500
or just the stigma of poverty.

00:53:21.500 --> 00:53:25.640
Bottom-up approaches
get rid of this cycle.

00:53:25.640 --> 00:53:30.061
So, let me leave you
citing here Jane Jacobs--

00:53:30.061 --> 00:53:32.060
from New York, but then
transplanted to Toronto,

00:53:32.060 --> 00:53:33.260
so I claim her as Canadian.

00:53:33.260 --> 00:53:34.912
[LAUGHTER]

00:53:34.912 --> 00:53:36.620
But let me change her
words a little bit.

00:53:36.620 --> 00:53:39.050
"Community sports
have the capability

00:53:39.050 --> 00:53:40.790
of providing something
for everybody,

00:53:40.790 --> 00:53:42.530
only because, and
only when, they

00:53:42.530 --> 00:53:43.900
are created for everybody."

00:53:43.900 --> 00:53:44.820
Thank you very much.

00:53:44.820 --> 00:53:48.250
[APPLAUSE]

00:53:55.110 --> 00:54:00.300
- So, thank you so much, to
our panelists for these really

00:54:00.300 --> 00:54:01.860
insightful remarks.

00:54:01.860 --> 00:54:05.190
And, you know, I was talking
to Parissa before our panel,

00:54:05.190 --> 00:54:06.870
and I said, well,
I hope we get some

00:54:06.870 --> 00:54:09.204
of those fist-pump moments,
like the first panel had,

00:54:09.204 --> 00:54:10.870
where people in the
audience are saying,

00:54:10.870 --> 00:54:13.290
yeah, it is a
rights-based issue.

00:54:13.290 --> 00:54:15.489
And I think that what
we've seen with this,

00:54:15.489 --> 00:54:18.030
is that even when we talk about
health-wellness, even if it's

00:54:18.030 --> 00:54:20.430
something as concrete
as a concussion,

00:54:20.430 --> 00:54:24.450
it's still a rights-based
issue at the end of the day.

00:54:24.450 --> 00:54:27.480
And it is a right to be
able to participate and play

00:54:27.480 --> 00:54:30.390
sports safely, and in
a fair environment,

00:54:30.390 --> 00:54:34.050
and to have access to identify
as an athlete or someone who

00:54:34.050 --> 00:54:36.490
wants to live an
active lifestyle,

00:54:36.490 --> 00:54:40.277
as Dr. Safai so
poignantly noted.

00:54:40.277 --> 00:54:42.360
So, I'd like to open it
up for some discussion now

00:54:42.360 --> 00:54:43.230
amongst the panel.

00:54:43.230 --> 00:54:48.270
And I'm going to kick it off
with a question focusing on,

00:54:48.270 --> 00:54:52.310
I think that we realize when
we talk about wellness-health

00:54:52.310 --> 00:54:54.420
in medicine that
very frequently we're

00:54:54.420 --> 00:54:56.030
quite reactive in our approach.

00:54:56.030 --> 00:54:58.860
So, the health care
system here in the US

00:54:58.860 --> 00:55:00.714
is known to be very reactive.

00:55:00.714 --> 00:55:02.880
We're very good at treating
disease when it happens,

00:55:02.880 --> 00:55:05.220
but we're very terrible,
or we don't focus enough

00:55:05.220 --> 00:55:06.450
on prevention.

00:55:06.450 --> 00:55:08.280
So, maybe we could
talk a little bit

00:55:08.280 --> 00:55:10.450
about what we're doing
in terms of prevention,

00:55:10.450 --> 00:55:12.450
and how we're trying to
move the needle on that,

00:55:12.450 --> 00:55:15.330
whether it's sports injuries,
or people being pressured

00:55:15.330 --> 00:55:17.040
for doping, or
thinking about being

00:55:17.040 --> 00:55:19.085
more proactive for communities.

00:55:23.935 --> 00:55:30.880
- Well, I think we start
by understanding that sport

00:55:30.880 --> 00:55:32.500
is a microcosm of society.

00:55:32.500 --> 00:55:35.170
In the United States, 95%
of our health care dollars

00:55:35.170 --> 00:55:38.680
are spent on treating
disease, and 5% is prevention.

00:55:38.680 --> 00:55:40.150
So, that's one social issue.

00:55:40.150 --> 00:55:42.470
The other, I
mentioned it briefly,

00:55:42.470 --> 00:55:47.350
is that we're not doing sport
right at the youth level.

00:55:47.350 --> 00:55:50.020
Even girls are
playing in traveling

00:55:50.020 --> 00:55:52.040
soccer leagues all year round.

00:55:52.040 --> 00:55:53.680
And we think that that's good.

00:55:53.680 --> 00:55:56.200
And it's bad, because we know
that the way we're doing sport

00:55:56.200 --> 00:55:59.740
is leading to a 75% drop-out
rate at the age of puberty.

00:55:59.740 --> 00:56:02.530
So, we have to really
take a giant step back.

00:56:02.530 --> 00:56:10.300
But I see, well, Nelson
Mandela, I think, said it right.

00:56:10.300 --> 00:56:12.010
He said, you can
measure a society

00:56:12.010 --> 00:56:14.680
by the way it treats sport.

00:56:14.680 --> 00:56:18.070
And the way we treat
sport in the United States

00:56:18.070 --> 00:56:22.450
is that we replace the one
day of worship in church

00:56:22.450 --> 00:56:25.100
with a day of worship
on the football field.

00:56:25.100 --> 00:56:26.750
And that's a metaphor.

00:56:26.750 --> 00:56:28.690
And we have to acknowledge that.

00:56:28.690 --> 00:56:32.110
So, I don't have the
answer, other than that I

00:56:32.110 --> 00:56:36.100
believe so deeply in sport that
I'm devoting my life to it.

00:56:36.100 --> 00:56:39.980
And I think it is really an
access to equal opportunity.

00:56:39.980 --> 00:56:42.938
But we're not doing it
right at the youth level.

00:56:42.938 --> 00:56:44.313
And that's where
it has to start.

00:56:48.100 --> 00:56:51.200
- I have a bit of
a different tack.

00:56:51.200 --> 00:56:55.730
As an academic, as also a
sociologist, I'm a little bit--

00:56:55.730 --> 00:56:58.980
I just am going to be
more critical here.

00:56:58.980 --> 00:57:01.640
So, the challenge that we
actually face with regards

00:57:01.640 --> 00:57:04.010
to this piece around
prevention versus action,

00:57:04.010 --> 00:57:06.350
is the fact that we
don't have good data.

00:57:06.350 --> 00:57:08.450
We really just don't
have great data.

00:57:08.450 --> 00:57:10.700
I said already, I intimated
in my presentation

00:57:10.700 --> 00:57:12.980
that, when it comes to sport
participation, the data

00:57:12.980 --> 00:57:14.960
that we have is really
quite imprecise.

00:57:14.960 --> 00:57:18.500
Because the data is coming
from who is playing--

00:57:18.500 --> 00:57:21.380
how many people are tuned in
and going through the turnstiles

00:57:21.380 --> 00:57:24.234
to get into the facilities
or to get into clubs.

00:57:24.234 --> 00:57:26.150
What we don't have great
data on our the folks

00:57:26.150 --> 00:57:29.560
who are absolutely
turned off of sport,

00:57:29.560 --> 00:57:32.266
and why are they
turned off of sport.

00:57:32.266 --> 00:57:33.640
The other challenge
that we face,

00:57:33.640 --> 00:57:36.370
too, is that we
also are really--

00:57:36.370 --> 00:57:38.140
we don't have very
good information

00:57:38.140 --> 00:57:39.640
on the number of
folks who are not

00:57:39.640 --> 00:57:42.340
necessarily interested in
organized competitive sport,

00:57:42.340 --> 00:57:43.090
but who--

00:57:43.090 --> 00:57:45.430
I think about kids and girls--

00:57:45.430 --> 00:57:47.950
who will happily go into
their room, lock the door,

00:57:47.950 --> 00:57:49.780
turn on the music,
and dance like there's

00:57:49.780 --> 00:57:52.360
no one watching, and are
getting physical activity

00:57:52.360 --> 00:57:53.740
in that sense.

00:57:53.740 --> 00:57:56.800
So, to come back to this
question around prevention

00:57:56.800 --> 00:57:59.590
and action, it's a
very challenging one

00:57:59.590 --> 00:58:01.930
because we don't
have very good data.

00:58:01.930 --> 00:58:04.240
The other challenge
is that there's

00:58:04.240 --> 00:58:09.190
a lot of rhetoric about
how sport is good for you.

00:58:09.190 --> 00:58:11.260
And yet, some of the data
that we just saw today

00:58:11.260 --> 00:58:13.210
really puts a pause on
that thinking, right.

00:58:13.210 --> 00:58:16.240
How good is sport for us?

00:58:16.240 --> 00:58:19.156
Do we really want to democratize
some of the highest levels

00:58:19.156 --> 00:58:20.280
of sport that we're seeing?

00:58:20.280 --> 00:58:21.970
I don't know.

00:58:21.970 --> 00:58:23.560
I played rugby for 20 years.

00:58:23.560 --> 00:58:25.810
It was powerfully
transformative in my life.

00:58:25.810 --> 00:58:29.680
It was absolutely meaningful
in so many ways, contributed

00:58:29.680 --> 00:58:31.300
to who I am today.

00:58:31.300 --> 00:58:33.940
But I also have the body
of a woman who played rugby

00:58:33.940 --> 00:58:37.900
for 20 years, with all of
the screws, and the pins,

00:58:37.900 --> 00:58:39.990
and all of that sort of stuff.

00:58:39.990 --> 00:58:43.549
Do we-- is it part of
our prevention strategy

00:58:43.549 --> 00:58:44.840
that we want to really support?

00:58:44.840 --> 00:58:47.089
I think there's some good,
thoughtful critical debates

00:58:47.089 --> 00:58:48.780
around that need to happen.

00:58:48.780 --> 00:58:52.300
I may have gone on a
tangent there, but.

00:58:52.300 --> 00:58:55.230
- Yeah, I guess
I would just say,

00:58:55.230 --> 00:58:57.360
and I don't disagree
at all, Parissa,

00:58:57.360 --> 00:58:58.360
with what you just said.

00:58:58.360 --> 00:59:00.750
I mean, there's
been many moments

00:59:00.750 --> 00:59:03.810
after sitting in long
interviews with athletes

00:59:03.810 --> 00:59:07.590
who have succumbed to the
temptation to dope where we--

00:59:07.590 --> 00:59:10.740
myself and an attorney or two--
would walk out of the room

00:59:10.740 --> 00:59:14.820
and say, you know,
it's too bad we don't--

00:59:14.820 --> 00:59:17.319
aren't filming these to
then show to parents.

00:59:17.319 --> 00:59:19.110
Because I think there
were a lot of parents

00:59:19.110 --> 00:59:22.710
out there that never would want
their son or daughter to be

00:59:22.710 --> 00:59:25.950
an elite-level athlete if they
have to go through the things

00:59:25.950 --> 00:59:28.590
that these athletes have had
to go through and then make

00:59:28.590 --> 00:59:32.160
in our world decisions
that compromise the values

00:59:32.160 --> 00:59:34.980
that they were taught, couldn't
look their parents in the face,

00:59:34.980 --> 00:59:37.697
kept secrets from their spouses
to break the rules of sport,

00:59:37.697 --> 00:59:38.780
just to gain an advantage.

00:59:38.780 --> 00:59:40.330
So, I think there's
some real truth to that

00:59:40.330 --> 00:59:42.080
that we certainly see
at the ground level.

00:59:42.080 --> 00:59:45.450
From-- and just one topic,
and I'll only mention it

00:59:45.450 --> 00:59:47.506
around this health
question-- and Brian,

00:59:47.506 --> 00:59:49.380
I think, actually, on
one of our phone calls,

00:59:49.380 --> 00:59:51.230
asked me to talk
about supplements.

00:59:51.230 --> 00:59:55.230
But one area that's also a real,
live issue for us, that I think

00:59:55.230 --> 00:59:59.070
is elite athletes
are bombarded--

00:59:59.070 --> 01:00:01.570
as are, I think, young
athletes-- you know,

01:00:01.570 --> 01:00:04.590
I saw supplement
powder drinks being

01:00:04.590 --> 01:00:06.600
used at my daughter's
10-year-old swim

01:00:06.600 --> 01:00:08.370
meet a few years ago.

01:00:08.370 --> 01:00:13.380
And this is an area where we
have very poor regulation.

01:00:13.380 --> 01:00:15.150
Some would argue
there's no regulation

01:00:15.150 --> 01:00:18.120
on the dietary
supplement market.

01:00:18.120 --> 01:00:19.800
There is some
legislation out there

01:00:19.800 --> 01:00:20.966
that attempts to control it.

01:00:20.966 --> 01:00:23.160
But it's a $30-plus
billion industry,

01:00:23.160 --> 01:00:26.580
and $8 to $10 billion of that
is on this performance category.

01:00:26.580 --> 01:00:29.850
And it's a pretty easy sell,
if you can have more energy,

01:00:29.850 --> 01:00:32.479
and you can build bigger
muscles, and you can be faster,

01:00:32.479 --> 01:00:34.020
and you can be better
in bed, and you

01:00:34.020 --> 01:00:37.164
can pay attention at
conferences like this easier.

01:00:37.164 --> 01:00:38.580
You know, it's a
really easy sell.

01:00:38.580 --> 01:00:42.900
And unfortunately,
there's not a whole lot

01:00:42.900 --> 01:00:45.390
to give good advice to athletes.

01:00:45.390 --> 01:00:46.260
And they're risky.

01:00:46.260 --> 01:00:47.759
And what we tell
our athletes, we've

01:00:47.759 --> 01:00:50.340
developed the website
"Supplement 411"--

01:00:50.340 --> 01:00:53.190
we pull supplements off
store shelves and test them.

01:00:53.190 --> 01:00:56.010
And, you know, there's
been a prenatal vitamin

01:00:56.010 --> 01:00:59.940
that hasn't contained
the amounts that it

01:00:59.940 --> 01:01:03.420
says on the labels and has
contained significantly

01:01:03.420 --> 01:01:05.970
more amounts of
certain vitamins that

01:01:05.970 --> 01:01:08.630
would be harmful at the
levels that they're taking.

01:01:08.630 --> 01:01:10.120
And that's just one example.

01:01:10.120 --> 01:01:13.560
There's also synthetic drugs,
and some of them as well,

01:01:13.560 --> 01:01:15.907
that have caused athletes
inadvertent positive tests

01:01:15.907 --> 01:01:16.990
that we have to deal with.

01:01:16.990 --> 01:01:22.410
So, I think we, having a
captive audience in our 2,500

01:01:22.410 --> 01:01:25.890
athletes that compete
within the Olympic movement

01:01:25.890 --> 01:01:27.510
on a daily basis,
attempt to do what

01:01:27.510 --> 01:01:29.820
we can do to address
some of these issues

01:01:29.820 --> 01:01:32.910
and supplements as one that's
right in the cross-hairs of us

01:01:32.910 --> 01:01:35.190
having to really give good
advice to those athletes

01:01:35.190 --> 01:01:38.400
at that level, to make
informed decisions around it.

01:01:38.400 --> 01:01:41.530
- Absolutely, thank you.

01:01:41.530 --> 01:01:44.730
So, and feel free to pipe in
if you have other questions

01:01:44.730 --> 01:01:46.770
for one another, too.

01:01:46.770 --> 01:01:50.010
One thing that I'm very
curious about, we've

01:01:50.010 --> 01:01:53.550
seen recent commercials
and media pieces focused

01:01:53.550 --> 01:01:58.350
on trying to change that, I
guess you could say, stigma--

01:01:58.350 --> 01:02:01.620
or the bias that we have about,
particularly, young girls

01:02:01.620 --> 01:02:02.332
being active.

01:02:02.332 --> 01:02:04.290
So, there is a recent
campaign about, you know,

01:02:04.290 --> 01:02:05.190
throw like a girl.

01:02:05.190 --> 01:02:06.898
What does that mean
to throw like a girl?

01:02:06.898 --> 01:02:10.050
And you know, I'm curious
to hear whether you think,

01:02:10.050 --> 01:02:12.690
particularly you, Parissa,
whether we're moving the needle

01:02:12.690 --> 01:02:14.400
one on when we
conceptualize and when

01:02:14.400 --> 01:02:15.900
we have that first
thought of, like,

01:02:15.900 --> 01:02:19.380
what are the differences
between young men and women?

01:02:19.380 --> 01:02:25.056
And whether or not our bias
about our expectations--

01:02:25.056 --> 01:02:26.430
do we think it's
changing at all,

01:02:26.430 --> 01:02:29.280
with some of these campaigns
that are coming out?

01:02:29.280 --> 01:02:32.880
- So, the pragmatist
in me will be

01:02:32.880 --> 01:02:37.200
quick to say that any sort of
campaign that, at some level,

01:02:37.200 --> 01:02:40.120
sort of seeks to boost girls'
and women's participation

01:02:40.120 --> 01:02:43.410
in sports should be applauded.

01:02:43.410 --> 01:02:45.390
The more critical
scientist in me,

01:02:45.390 --> 01:02:48.120
though, is very quick to start
to see some of the places

01:02:48.120 --> 01:02:50.269
where those are
really quite limited.

01:02:50.269 --> 01:02:52.185
There was a campaign,
the "throw like a girl."

01:02:52.185 --> 01:02:56.130
A few years ago, they had the
"if you let me play," right.

01:02:56.130 --> 01:02:59.060
I wonder if some of
you may remember that.

01:02:59.060 --> 01:03:02.130
The big challenges with
these types of campaigns

01:03:02.130 --> 01:03:04.950
is that they do nothing
to actually destabilize

01:03:04.950 --> 01:03:08.760
the stereotypes that are faced
by girls and women in sport.

01:03:08.760 --> 01:03:11.340
They're not about
saying, whoa, what

01:03:11.340 --> 01:03:13.960
we say about girls and
women in sport is false.

01:03:13.960 --> 01:03:16.740
It's not supported
by any of the data,

01:03:16.740 --> 01:03:18.860
physiological all the way
to social to cultural.

01:03:18.860 --> 01:03:20.970
It actually reproduces
all of that.

01:03:20.970 --> 01:03:23.370
All it says is, well, let's
just have more opportunities

01:03:23.370 --> 01:03:24.580
for girls and women to do it.

01:03:24.580 --> 01:03:26.371
And that's a disservice
to girls and women,

01:03:26.371 --> 01:03:28.140
but also to boys and men.

01:03:28.140 --> 01:03:29.790
The reproduction of
these stereotypes

01:03:29.790 --> 01:03:31.410
are just about what
girls and women

01:03:31.410 --> 01:03:34.140
can do on the sporting field
are just as damaging for boys

01:03:34.140 --> 01:03:38.370
and men, who need to be
seeing more and more sort

01:03:38.370 --> 01:03:41.760
of competent, capable women
on the fields, off the fields,

01:03:41.760 --> 01:03:44.970
in the coaching roles, in
the administrative roles.

01:03:44.970 --> 01:03:46.740
And they're not seen it.

01:03:46.740 --> 01:03:51.770
So again, it's a,
yay, more campaigns,

01:03:51.770 --> 01:03:54.080
more commercials-- excellent.

01:03:54.080 --> 01:03:57.740
But we need to be very
sort of controlled

01:03:57.740 --> 01:03:59.370
with how much
applause we give them.

01:03:59.370 --> 01:04:02.540
They're very, very,
very double-edged and--

01:04:02.540 --> 01:04:04.430
- Potentially one piece,
but certainly not--

01:04:04.430 --> 01:04:05.935
- Yeah.

01:04:05.935 --> 01:04:08.540
And the fact that
they reproduce these,

01:04:08.540 --> 01:04:12.170
they're not destabilizing the
boxes of sex and gender, right.

01:04:12.170 --> 01:04:13.490
They're not shifting them.

01:04:13.490 --> 01:04:16.670
Even though, in other areas,
they are being shifted.

01:04:16.670 --> 01:04:20.390
I think of what's happening
in the transgender

01:04:20.390 --> 01:04:23.330
movement, right, and some
of the varied nuances

01:04:23.330 --> 01:04:25.070
that are being explored there.

01:04:25.070 --> 01:04:26.720
But those kinds of
nuances are being

01:04:26.720 --> 01:04:30.280
supported in other
spheres and not in sport.

01:04:30.280 --> 01:04:31.520
- Excellent, thank you.

01:04:31.520 --> 01:04:33.410
So, we'll have time
now to open it up

01:04:33.410 --> 01:04:34.940
to questions, prior to lunch.

01:04:34.940 --> 01:04:37.850
So, we have about 25 minutes.

01:04:37.850 --> 01:04:40.400
And I invite everyone,
please, to use the mic

01:04:40.400 --> 01:04:42.030
in the center of the room.

01:04:42.030 --> 01:04:45.410
If you have a question,
please introduce yourself,

01:04:45.410 --> 01:04:48.620
and try to be brief, and be
sure to keep it to a question.

01:04:48.620 --> 01:04:50.360
And we'll get through
as many as we can

01:04:50.360 --> 01:04:53.656
and use the wisdom
on the panel here

01:04:53.656 --> 01:04:54.780
to the best of our ability.

01:04:54.780 --> 01:04:56.540
So, yes, thank you.

01:04:56.540 --> 01:04:57.220
- Hi.

01:04:57.220 --> 01:04:59.780
I'm Tori Clay.

01:04:59.780 --> 01:05:03.230
Before I make my
comment, I'd like

01:05:03.230 --> 01:05:05.570
to thank the unsung
heroes here, the people

01:05:05.570 --> 01:05:09.320
in the back of the room because
I wear two hearing aids,

01:05:09.320 --> 01:05:12.380
and this is so rare for me to
come to something like this

01:05:12.380 --> 01:05:14.564
and be able to hear every word.

01:05:14.564 --> 01:05:15.064
- Yay!

01:05:15.064 --> 01:05:15.536
[APPLAUSE]

01:05:15.536 --> 01:05:16.577
- Really appreciate that.

01:05:16.577 --> 01:05:19.784
[APPLAUSE]

01:05:22.160 --> 01:05:25.220
Obviously, I'm
transgender female.

01:05:25.220 --> 01:05:32.660
And when, Brian, you had
that pledge up there,

01:05:32.660 --> 01:05:35.300
I just want you to know I
have a little issue with it.

01:05:35.300 --> 01:05:40.150
I felt excluded
because it said, it

01:05:40.150 --> 01:05:46.520
was a phrase, something like,
racial and ethnic diversity.

01:05:46.520 --> 01:05:50.720
And then after gender
was the word "equality."

01:05:50.720 --> 01:05:54.620
And I'd much prefer
gender diversity

01:05:54.620 --> 01:05:56.125
be included in that pledge.

01:05:58.850 --> 01:06:02.740
- Yeah, so I think
that's a fair point.

01:06:02.740 --> 01:06:05.590
And actually that's
a point I'm going

01:06:05.590 --> 01:06:08.710
to bring back to the people
who put together that pledge.

01:06:08.710 --> 01:06:11.070
So, how the pledge
came about, is

01:06:11.070 --> 01:06:14.620
the head of diversity and
inclusion at the NCAA,

01:06:14.620 --> 01:06:17.140
and it's a staff initially
written thing, and then

01:06:17.140 --> 01:06:19.090
the Board of
Governors, they have

01:06:19.090 --> 01:06:24.460
to approve that for it to
become open policy like that.

01:06:24.460 --> 01:06:27.910
And I think that's
a very fair point.

01:06:27.910 --> 01:06:29.500
I think another fair point is--

01:06:32.220 --> 01:06:34.490
and this isn't just because
I'm part of the NCAA,

01:06:34.490 --> 01:06:36.170
it's because I
truly believe this--

01:06:36.170 --> 01:06:39.140
I think if you follow some of
the politics of what's happened

01:06:39.140 --> 01:06:42.650
recently, and because the
NCAA was unwavering in certain

01:06:42.650 --> 01:06:47.180
aspects, that we have seen
some laws change particularly

01:06:47.180 --> 01:06:52.250
in North Carolina--
imperfectly, very imperfectly--

01:06:52.250 --> 01:06:57.920
because the standard was set at
still a bar that many believe

01:06:57.920 --> 01:06:58.700
is unacceptable.

01:06:58.700 --> 01:07:00.910
But that's a standard
that exists in--

01:07:00.910 --> 01:07:01.850
- It is unacceptable.

01:07:01.850 --> 01:07:05.360
- a considerable number
of states in this country.

01:07:05.360 --> 01:07:08.390
But with regard to certain
transgender issues,

01:07:08.390 --> 01:07:13.040
I think we are learning, and
we are trying to be a model.

01:07:13.040 --> 01:07:14.420
But your point's
very well taken.

01:07:14.420 --> 01:07:14.940
- Thank you.

01:07:14.940 --> 01:07:18.020
And I'd like to
thank the whole panel

01:07:18.020 --> 01:07:21.520
for mentioning transgender
in a lot of the things

01:07:21.520 --> 01:07:23.540
that you mentioned it today.

01:07:23.540 --> 01:07:24.890
I appreciate that.

01:07:24.890 --> 01:07:25.784
- Thank you.

01:07:25.784 --> 01:07:29.102
[APPLAUSE]

01:07:31.709 --> 01:07:32.420
Please.

01:07:32.420 --> 01:07:34.010
- My name is Sam Bachelor.

01:07:34.010 --> 01:07:37.490
I have a question particularly
about performance-enhancing

01:07:37.490 --> 01:07:42.260
drugs and that the language
around the use of them

01:07:42.260 --> 01:07:46.920
is always couched, or often
couched, in terms of fairness.

01:07:46.920 --> 01:07:49.100
Whereas it often
really seems it's

01:07:49.100 --> 01:07:53.770
a matter of health or
safety for the athletes,

01:07:53.770 --> 01:07:58.430
and that you're basically
asking the athletes to choose

01:07:58.430 --> 01:08:02.270
between their long-term or even
short-term health and a higher

01:08:02.270 --> 01:08:04.010
performance level.

01:08:04.010 --> 01:08:07.760
And I'm curious why you think
that hasn't taken more hold

01:08:07.760 --> 01:08:14.390
and hasn't been pitched or even
championed more by athletes

01:08:14.390 --> 01:08:15.830
as an issue of
safety, as opposed

01:08:15.830 --> 01:08:18.649
to an issue of fairness?

01:08:18.649 --> 01:08:20.779
- Yeah, well, thanks
for your question, Sam.

01:08:20.779 --> 01:08:22.910
You know, listen, I
think, first of all,

01:08:22.910 --> 01:08:26.779
for a particular substance
or method, so a transfusion

01:08:26.779 --> 01:08:29.990
or an IV, whatever the case
may be that's prohibited,

01:08:29.990 --> 01:08:32.479
it has to meet two
of three criteria.

01:08:32.479 --> 01:08:35.340
One, is it enhances performance,
or has the potential to.

01:08:35.340 --> 01:08:37.069
Two, it violates
health or safety

01:08:37.069 --> 01:08:38.810
of the individual
athlete taking it.

01:08:38.810 --> 01:08:41.660
But there's also a concern, and
some of the Supreme Court cases

01:08:41.660 --> 01:08:45.800
have dealt with, when you
have a high football player,

01:08:45.800 --> 01:08:47.490
let's say, on cocaine--

01:08:47.490 --> 01:08:50.270
they're more reckless,
inhibitions are down,

01:08:50.270 --> 01:08:51.988
they might cause
injury to other people

01:08:51.988 --> 01:08:53.279
that they're competing against.

01:08:53.279 --> 01:08:55.487
So there's kind of a double
facet there from a health

01:08:55.487 --> 01:08:56.450
and safety standpoint.

01:08:56.450 --> 01:08:59.840
And then this more
nebulous spirit of sport--

01:08:59.840 --> 01:09:03.470
you know, I think part of the
problem is young athletes--

01:09:03.470 --> 01:09:07.069
and some of you will remember
there was a Sports Illustrated

01:09:07.069 --> 01:09:08.210
study that was done.

01:09:08.210 --> 01:09:11.970
I think it's since been
refuted as not credible.

01:09:11.970 --> 01:09:16.729
But the exaggerated
point it makes--

01:09:16.729 --> 01:09:18.890
the point, I think,
is the biggest hurdle

01:09:18.890 --> 01:09:22.189
in getting athletes to
recognize this issue is,

01:09:22.189 --> 01:09:24.450
they said, if you can
win a gold medal--

01:09:24.450 --> 01:09:26.450
take a drug, not get
caught, win a gold medal,

01:09:26.450 --> 01:09:28.760
but die within five
years, I think--

01:09:28.760 --> 01:09:30.200
you may remember the study--

01:09:30.200 --> 01:09:33.140
and a majority of the people
said, yeah, they would do it.

01:09:33.140 --> 01:09:36.080
So, I think you're dealing with
a population of young athletes

01:09:36.080 --> 01:09:39.270
who really aren't
fearful of something

01:09:39.270 --> 01:09:40.520
bad happening to their health.

01:09:40.520 --> 01:09:42.710
And if they can get
a short-term glory,

01:09:42.710 --> 01:09:45.104
maybe it translates into
millions of dollars,

01:09:45.104 --> 01:09:46.729
and they can take
care of their family.

01:09:46.729 --> 01:09:50.180
They're not necessarily thinking
ahead, a few years, too.

01:09:50.180 --> 01:09:52.010
But I think you
also-- that said,

01:09:52.010 --> 01:09:56.720
I think you're also seeing
a generation of athletes

01:09:56.720 --> 01:09:59.960
who are coming off the
field, who have participated

01:09:59.960 --> 01:10:03.590
in the era where these synthetic
pharmaceutical drugs have

01:10:03.590 --> 01:10:06.230
flooded the market like we've
never seen before in a very

01:10:06.230 --> 01:10:07.760
concentrated time period.

01:10:07.760 --> 01:10:10.460
And I think you have to
look at some of the injuries

01:10:10.460 --> 01:10:13.850
that these players in
their 40s, 50s, and 60s

01:10:13.850 --> 01:10:17.230
are now suffering from,
if they're still around.

01:10:17.230 --> 01:10:19.400
And let's have a
candid conversation

01:10:19.400 --> 01:10:22.910
about what else, other than
the contact of the game,

01:10:22.910 --> 01:10:26.360
for example, is causing
some of these injuries.

01:10:26.360 --> 01:10:31.250
And very many of them seem
to be textbook, classic side

01:10:31.250 --> 01:10:34.460
effects of the abuse of
androgenic-anabolic steroids,

01:10:34.460 --> 01:10:35.150
for example.

01:10:35.150 --> 01:10:37.670
So, I think we'll see
ongoing discussion

01:10:37.670 --> 01:10:40.442
about those very issues.

01:10:40.442 --> 01:10:41.300
- Thank you.

01:10:41.300 --> 01:10:43.280
- Thank you.

01:10:43.280 --> 01:10:44.150
- Hi.

01:10:44.150 --> 01:10:45.260
My name is Kira Healey.

01:10:45.260 --> 01:10:47.440
I appreciate you
mentioning North Carolina.

01:10:47.440 --> 01:10:49.430
I am currently working at Duke.

01:10:49.430 --> 01:10:52.130
And I would also like to point
out, as a rival to tennis,

01:10:52.130 --> 01:10:56.000
that roller derby is
a fast-growing sport

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.250
for both men,
women, and children.

01:10:58.250 --> 01:11:00.420
And it's played
coed at many levels,

01:11:00.420 --> 01:11:02.750
though not at the elite level.

01:11:02.750 --> 01:11:06.860
For the policies and for
testosterone as a kind

01:11:06.860 --> 01:11:09.290
of doping, or potentially
as a kind of doping,

01:11:09.290 --> 01:11:11.540
as a performance-enhancing
drug, I

01:11:11.540 --> 01:11:13.670
would like to encourage
you to study sports

01:11:13.670 --> 01:11:16.820
outside of the ones that
are legitimized by the NCAA

01:11:16.820 --> 01:11:19.010
and the Olympics,
and look at sports

01:11:19.010 --> 01:11:23.100
that, in fact, have gender
policies that are quite broad.

01:11:23.100 --> 01:11:25.880
For example, the Women's
Flat Track Derby Association,

01:11:25.880 --> 01:11:29.810
if you identify as a woman,
or you are "gender expansive,"

01:11:29.810 --> 01:11:31.310
you may skate.

01:11:31.310 --> 01:11:34.760
For the Men's Derby
Association, their policy

01:11:34.760 --> 01:11:38.540
is, we do not interfere
in the privacy of skaters.

01:11:38.540 --> 01:11:42.350
Their presence on the
track is enough to say they

01:11:42.350 --> 01:11:44.240
can skate with the men's team.

01:11:44.240 --> 01:11:48.860
Same for Junior Derby, which is
coed, all the way from 7 to 17.

01:11:48.860 --> 01:11:50.487
Boys and girls play
together, and there

01:11:50.487 --> 01:11:53.366
are adolescents who
are transitioning

01:11:53.366 --> 01:11:54.740
from one way or
the other, or are

01:11:54.740 --> 01:11:56.000
considered gender expansive.

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:59.750
So, if you would like to
inform yourselves regarding

01:11:59.750 --> 01:12:03.020
gender expensive skater,
skaters in transition, athletes

01:12:03.020 --> 01:12:05.300
in a full contact
sport that play coed

01:12:05.300 --> 01:12:07.790
at many levels of
the game, I recommend

01:12:07.790 --> 01:12:10.651
that you look at that sport.

01:12:10.651 --> 01:12:11.150
- Thank you.

01:12:11.150 --> 01:12:13.940
- Thanks.

01:12:13.940 --> 01:12:14.960
- I'll just comment.

01:12:14.960 --> 01:12:17.570
I think we've seen--

01:12:17.570 --> 01:12:21.050
so, I don't know sport very
well outside of this country,

01:12:21.050 --> 01:12:23.060
but I'm exceptionally
data-driven when

01:12:23.060 --> 01:12:24.020
I look at things.

01:12:24.020 --> 01:12:28.790
And sport has been
transformative in terms

01:12:28.790 --> 01:12:33.430
of opening up opportunities,
at some level, racially

01:12:33.430 --> 01:12:37.070
and for women participation.

01:12:37.070 --> 01:12:39.740
I think where we are
really missing the greatest

01:12:39.740 --> 01:12:41.310
opportunity--

01:12:41.310 --> 01:12:43.880
and if we look at the
data we understand this--

01:12:43.880 --> 01:12:47.150
is that there is a
phenomenal segregation

01:12:47.150 --> 01:12:51.382
of sport from our
public high schools

01:12:51.382 --> 01:12:53.090
and public grade
schools in this country.

01:12:53.090 --> 01:12:54.210
It's phenomenal.

01:12:54.210 --> 01:12:56.960
And it actually is cited
as one of the five most

01:12:56.960 --> 01:12:59.460
important reasons why
there is sport dropout.

01:12:59.460 --> 01:13:01.460
And we can argue whether
a sport is good or bad,

01:13:01.460 --> 01:13:05.300
but the data are unequivocal as
well, at least from the NCAA,

01:13:05.300 --> 01:13:06.950
that those who
participate in sport--

01:13:06.950 --> 01:13:09.120
and we do quality-of-life
studies 10, 20,

01:13:09.120 --> 01:13:10.910
30 years later--

01:13:10.910 --> 01:13:13.070
and even when we look at
the mental-health aspects

01:13:13.070 --> 01:13:15.830
in college, sport
offers something

01:13:15.830 --> 01:13:17.550
that non-sport does not.

01:13:17.550 --> 01:13:20.180
And that's just looking
at sport, not exercise.

01:13:20.180 --> 01:13:22.430
I think we have to get a
better dive into exercise.

01:13:22.430 --> 01:13:24.110
But at the grade
school level, there

01:13:24.110 --> 01:13:28.430
is an exceptional opportunity
to break all of the barriers

01:13:28.430 --> 01:13:29.702
with equal participation.

01:13:29.702 --> 01:13:31.160
And the greatest
thing that I saw--

01:13:31.160 --> 01:13:33.860
and there are pretty good data
on this in New York City--

01:13:33.860 --> 01:13:38.420
it was, when a single person
brought ballroom dancing

01:13:38.420 --> 01:13:41.540
into New York City public
school and then expanded it to I

01:13:41.540 --> 01:13:44.480
think over 50,000 kids
who were participating.

01:13:44.480 --> 01:13:47.730
And you track these kids, and
they become dancers for life.

01:13:47.730 --> 01:13:51.270
But more importantly, they
learn how to interact together

01:13:51.270 --> 01:13:52.410
at the most profound level.

01:13:52.410 --> 01:13:53.930
They learn how to
touch one another,

01:13:53.930 --> 01:13:55.360
and to lead, and to follow.

01:13:55.360 --> 01:13:57.470
And so, we need more
examples like this.

01:13:57.470 --> 01:13:59.420
But it's not-- in
this country, it's not

01:13:59.420 --> 01:14:03.560
happening at the grade-school
level, where it must start.

01:14:03.560 --> 01:14:04.860
- Yes?

01:14:04.860 --> 01:14:05.360
- Hello.

01:14:05.360 --> 01:14:09.470
My name is Connor, and I'm a
senior at Tufts University.

01:14:09.470 --> 01:14:11.930
I just wanted to ask you guys
a question about something

01:14:11.930 --> 01:14:13.721
that wasn't really
brought up on the panel.

01:14:13.721 --> 01:14:16.730
And I was kind of
surprised about that.

01:14:16.730 --> 01:14:20.370
How do you feel that eating
disorder is impacting

01:14:20.370 --> 01:14:23.390
women and men, as well?

01:14:23.390 --> 01:14:25.890
And how is that being combated
at the higher-up level?

01:14:29.642 --> 01:14:30.600
- Do you want to start?

01:14:30.600 --> 01:14:31.100
- Go ahead.

01:14:31.100 --> 01:14:31.854
- Yeah, go ahead.

01:14:37.185 --> 01:14:39.810
- So, just to be clear, you want
to know about high-performance

01:14:39.810 --> 01:14:40.601
sport?

01:14:40.601 --> 01:14:41.100
- Right.

01:14:41.100 --> 01:14:44.700
- And so, from a
research perspective--

01:14:44.700 --> 01:14:46.160
and I don't specialize
in the area,

01:14:46.160 --> 01:14:48.660
or I don't do a great deal of
research in the area of eating

01:14:48.660 --> 01:14:49.476
disorders.

01:14:49.476 --> 01:14:51.600
But what we do know is
that, yes, the higher up you

01:14:51.600 --> 01:14:54.183
move up the competitive sporting
ladder, the greater tolerance

01:14:54.183 --> 01:14:56.100
for just what's
called, as shorthand

01:14:56.100 --> 01:14:58.560
in the sociology of sport,
the "culture of risk,"

01:14:58.560 --> 01:15:00.540
which is more specifically
about tolerance

01:15:00.540 --> 01:15:03.150
for health-compromising
behaviors,

01:15:03.150 --> 01:15:06.930
including eating disorders,
or excessive exercise.

01:15:06.930 --> 01:15:09.357
Part of that is part
and parcel of what

01:15:09.357 --> 01:15:11.190
it means to be a
high-performance athletes--

01:15:11.190 --> 01:15:15.240
folks who are putting in 40,
50 hours to train, let alone

01:15:15.240 --> 01:15:16.530
get ready for competitions.

01:15:20.430 --> 01:15:21.600
How is it being managed?

01:15:21.600 --> 01:15:23.070
I can't speak with confidence.

01:15:23.070 --> 01:15:27.012
But if I may throw a
little bit of a spanner

01:15:27.012 --> 01:15:29.220
into the works, a different
way of thinking about it,

01:15:29.220 --> 01:15:30.960
I do do research
looking at poverty

01:15:30.960 --> 01:15:32.880
amongst high-performance
athletes.

01:15:32.880 --> 01:15:35.310
And one of the
repeated messages I

01:15:35.310 --> 01:15:38.400
hear from athletes, most of whom
are living below the poverty

01:15:38.400 --> 01:15:41.400
line, it's very-- they
are the exceptional ones,

01:15:41.400 --> 01:15:42.857
are the ones with
the sponsorship,

01:15:42.857 --> 01:15:44.190
with the commercials, et cetera.

01:15:44.190 --> 01:15:47.250
Most of them are actually
really quite impoverished.

01:15:47.250 --> 01:15:50.820
And it's almost like
forced starvation.

01:15:50.820 --> 01:15:52.759
I've spoken to many
athletes who speak about,

01:15:52.759 --> 01:15:55.050
many nights, having peanut
butter and jelly sandwiches.

01:15:55.050 --> 01:15:57.300
And that's the only meal
that they can afford.

01:15:57.300 --> 01:15:58.770
It's not what you've asked.

01:15:58.770 --> 01:16:01.680
But it is a different way
of thinking about some

01:16:01.680 --> 01:16:04.530
of the determinants of
a very dangerous, sort

01:16:04.530 --> 01:16:07.140
of health-compromising
behaviors and practices.

01:16:07.140 --> 01:16:09.660
But maybe Brian can speak
with greater confidence

01:16:09.660 --> 01:16:11.145
about your question.

01:16:13.760 --> 01:16:15.642
- Yes, so what was really the--?

01:16:15.642 --> 01:16:18.040
- Eating disorders,
disordered eating,

01:16:18.040 --> 01:16:21.856
and like, female athletes
and disordered eating.

01:16:21.856 --> 01:16:25.680
And like, it being an
issue with regards to--

01:16:25.680 --> 01:16:26.776
- For the athletes.

01:16:26.776 --> 01:16:27.901
- The competitive athletes.

01:16:27.901 --> 01:16:32.010
- Yeah, so, just because I'm not
sure I completely understood.

01:16:32.010 --> 01:16:35.820
So, the competitive athletes at
the elite level, the question

01:16:35.820 --> 01:16:38.190
is--?

01:16:38.190 --> 01:16:41.220
- Just what has been done at the
higher-up level to kind of look

01:16:41.220 --> 01:16:45.430
into this, and how
it's being reconciled?

01:16:45.430 --> 01:16:47.820
Just, like, how much
research has been done?

01:16:47.820 --> 01:16:48.630
- It's not.

01:16:48.630 --> 01:16:51.480
[LAUGHS] Sorry, I
shouldn't be laughing.

01:16:51.480 --> 01:16:51.980
I apologize.

01:16:51.980 --> 01:16:55.230
- Is it a main focal point?

01:16:55.230 --> 01:16:56.730
- Yeah, at the
highest level, or so,

01:16:56.730 --> 01:16:59.580
addressing, say, the
female athlete triad is,

01:16:59.580 --> 01:17:01.860
so, I think the
International Olympic

01:17:01.860 --> 01:17:05.310
Committee took a great lead
in that when, what they do

01:17:05.310 --> 01:17:06.162
is they--

01:17:06.162 --> 01:17:07.620
and Travis and I
talking about this

01:17:07.620 --> 01:17:13.084
beforehand-- they organize these
two- or three-day symposium

01:17:13.084 --> 01:17:14.250
where they address an issue.

01:17:14.250 --> 01:17:17.220
So they address an issue
of female athlete triad.

01:17:17.220 --> 01:17:20.220
And it spun into
a differentiation

01:17:20.220 --> 01:17:23.580
of female athlete triad
and energy deficiency,

01:17:23.580 --> 01:17:26.070
and saying that
those are really--

01:17:26.070 --> 01:17:28.892
it might be a continuum, but
there are two separate issues.

01:17:28.892 --> 01:17:30.600
So, energy deficiency
means you're simply

01:17:30.600 --> 01:17:33.300
not getting the energy
requirements for what you need.

01:17:33.300 --> 01:17:38.610
And and we see that that
is very high in sports

01:17:38.610 --> 01:17:42.050
where there is a certain
uniform that's worn.

01:17:42.050 --> 01:17:45.020
And so, like, in
men's wrestling,

01:17:45.020 --> 01:17:48.660
or in women's swimming,
women's track and field.

01:17:48.660 --> 01:17:51.650
And so, that's one aspect.

01:17:51.650 --> 01:17:53.750
Energy deficiency
does not mean that you

01:17:53.750 --> 01:17:56.630
move to female
athlete triad per se,

01:17:56.630 --> 01:17:59.900
which is the combination of
not menstruating, and having

01:17:59.900 --> 01:18:03.020
an eating disorder,
and bone loss.

01:18:03.020 --> 01:18:05.300
And that has a much
higher morbidity

01:18:05.300 --> 01:18:08.300
and even mortality rate to it.

01:18:08.300 --> 01:18:11.180
I think the IOC took
the lead in trying

01:18:11.180 --> 01:18:14.360
to then educate the entire
sports body about that.

01:18:14.360 --> 01:18:18.170
I can just say, we're trying
to do that at the NCAA level.

01:18:18.170 --> 01:18:20.330
But here is the block.

01:18:20.330 --> 01:18:24.080
And Travis actually, I think,
insightfully, made a comment

01:18:24.080 --> 01:18:27.980
that we must understand
because the block is happening

01:18:27.980 --> 01:18:30.170
at the coaching level.

01:18:30.170 --> 01:18:32.990
The coaches say, this is
what you must look like.

01:18:32.990 --> 01:18:34.520
This is what you must do.

01:18:34.520 --> 01:18:37.440
And the United
States of America,

01:18:37.440 --> 01:18:40.860
as great as we may be, to be
a coach, all you have to do

01:18:40.860 --> 01:18:44.780
is hold up a shingle
and say, I'm a coach.

01:18:44.780 --> 01:18:46.730
In Europe, you are
required to take

01:18:46.730 --> 01:18:51.810
hundreds of hours of in-class
and experiential learning.

01:18:51.810 --> 01:18:54.320
So now, there are
some governing bodies

01:18:54.320 --> 01:18:58.100
that are moving to requiring a
master's level certification.

01:18:58.100 --> 01:19:00.680
And I'll speak out, because
tennis just started USTA U.

01:19:00.680 --> 01:19:01.970
But there are others.

01:19:01.970 --> 01:19:04.490
I just had a meeting last
week with the PGA tour,

01:19:04.490 --> 01:19:06.454
and they're thinking of
doing the same thing.

01:19:06.454 --> 01:19:08.370
Wrestling is thinking
of doing the same thing.

01:19:08.370 --> 01:19:10.580
We have to have a movement
in this country, where

01:19:10.580 --> 01:19:13.280
if you're going to be a
coach, you must understand

01:19:13.280 --> 01:19:14.470
what it means to be a coach.

01:19:14.470 --> 01:19:16.370
You must understand
the sport sciences.

01:19:16.370 --> 01:19:19.880
And we are so far away from
that that it's dangerous.

01:19:19.880 --> 01:19:21.980
And that gets to
the level of, so,

01:19:21.980 --> 01:19:24.450
how do we influence our athletes
about the female athlete

01:19:24.450 --> 01:19:25.970
triad and eating disorders?

01:19:25.970 --> 01:19:28.790
When Travis also said the
number one influence on athletes

01:19:28.790 --> 01:19:33.440
is the coach, there
is the disconnect.

01:19:33.440 --> 01:19:35.140
- And I'll add,
briefly, as well, I

01:19:35.140 --> 01:19:39.960
think that I certainly know
from transitioning in my role

01:19:39.960 --> 01:19:42.640
as an athlete to now
practicing sport medicine,

01:19:42.640 --> 01:19:46.240
that there's certainly been an
evolution in the recognition

01:19:46.240 --> 01:19:49.720
of eating disorders, and
that evolving into concepts

01:19:49.720 --> 01:19:51.700
like the female
athlete triad or what

01:19:51.700 --> 01:19:57.340
the IOC titled "relative
energy deficiency" in sport.

01:19:57.340 --> 01:20:00.130
And it's better
than it used to be,

01:20:00.130 --> 01:20:02.350
in terms of relative
awareness of the fact

01:20:02.350 --> 01:20:06.072
that that as an entity is
just as dangerous as some

01:20:06.072 --> 01:20:07.780
of the other things
that we did describe,

01:20:07.780 --> 01:20:09.370
like concussion and ACL tears.

01:20:09.370 --> 01:20:13.270
It's yet another
health-related issue

01:20:13.270 --> 01:20:16.690
that does show some
propensity towards impacting

01:20:16.690 --> 01:20:18.790
female athletes
disproportionately.

01:20:18.790 --> 01:20:21.410
Although it does
impact males, as well.

01:20:21.410 --> 01:20:23.590
And we just have a
lot more work to do

01:20:23.590 --> 01:20:26.200
to educate athletes--
the entire entourage,

01:20:26.200 --> 01:20:30.190
as well as even our colleagues
in the medical community.

01:20:30.190 --> 01:20:33.340
We are trying to
kick off some work

01:20:33.340 --> 01:20:36.820
on looking at these issues,
the female athlete triad,

01:20:36.820 --> 01:20:38.360
et cetera, in
Paralympic athletes,

01:20:38.360 --> 01:20:40.690
for example, where there's
nothing known currently.

01:20:40.690 --> 01:20:42.250
So, it's very much
an evolving area,

01:20:42.250 --> 01:20:45.010
and I appreciate-- that
was a great question.

01:20:45.010 --> 01:20:47.170
- I just say, just real quick--

01:20:47.170 --> 01:20:48.810
clearly, not enough
is being done.

01:20:48.810 --> 01:20:51.580
And I think we have to
be realistic about why

01:20:51.580 --> 01:20:53.470
some of these issues
aren't being addressed

01:20:53.470 --> 01:20:56.680
by athletic programs, whether
it's in a college setting,

01:20:56.680 --> 01:20:58.870
whether it's by
international federations.

01:20:58.870 --> 01:21:00.730
Because it cuts
against the money

01:21:00.730 --> 01:21:03.470
that could be used to
win, quite frankly.

01:21:03.470 --> 01:21:05.650
And I think we just have
to be realistic about that

01:21:05.650 --> 01:21:08.500
from an enforcement standpoint,
which is where I come from.

01:21:08.500 --> 01:21:10.270
I'm not a sport organization.

01:21:10.270 --> 01:21:12.820
We're independent of
sport organizations.

01:21:12.820 --> 01:21:16.150
I think we see a couple
of disturbing trends, that

01:21:16.150 --> 01:21:20.960
one clearly being one of
those trends that we see,

01:21:20.960 --> 01:21:24.460
particularly where prohibited
substances or supplements might

01:21:24.460 --> 01:21:28.330
be introduced to help combat or
provide the nutritional needs

01:21:28.330 --> 01:21:30.340
that someone otherwise needs.

01:21:30.340 --> 01:21:34.680
Also, what we're seeing is
this abuse of non-prohibited,

01:21:34.680 --> 01:21:37.690
so they're drugs that are
allowed to be used in sport--

01:21:37.690 --> 01:21:39.640
like tramadol, for example--

01:21:39.640 --> 01:21:41.920
like thyroxine, for example--

01:21:41.920 --> 01:21:43.540
thyroxine, a
classic one that can

01:21:43.540 --> 01:21:46.710
be used for weight loss,
where if someone doesn't have,

01:21:46.710 --> 01:21:50.020
at least, under our US medical
guidelines and particular state

01:21:50.020 --> 01:21:53.770
guidelines, reason enough to
use them, they're abusing them,

01:21:53.770 --> 01:21:56.050
in fact, for sport performance.

01:21:56.050 --> 01:21:58.410
And there's serious
questions around health.

01:21:58.410 --> 01:22:02.150
It falls outside of our
enforcement jurisdiction.

01:22:02.150 --> 01:22:05.650
Some sports have put in a
code of conduct violations

01:22:05.650 --> 01:22:08.590
that might capture some
of those pressures that

01:22:08.590 --> 01:22:11.200
are being put on athletes
to starve themselves

01:22:11.200 --> 01:22:13.960
or abuse prescription
medications for performance

01:22:13.960 --> 01:22:14.860
purposes.

01:22:14.860 --> 01:22:17.950
I think the US is in the
process and has just--

01:22:17.950 --> 01:22:21.490
there's a bill pending in
Congress, the Feinstein

01:22:21.490 --> 01:22:23.530
Bill on the US
Center for SafeSport,

01:22:23.530 --> 01:22:27.400
the USOC has announced it
opening earlier this month,

01:22:27.400 --> 01:22:29.240
or maybe by March 1, I think.

01:22:29.240 --> 01:22:33.310
And it's going to deal with,
from an enforcement standpoint,

01:22:33.310 --> 01:22:36.700
things like bullying,
harassment, sexual abuse.

01:22:36.700 --> 01:22:39.730
And we'll see where some
of these trends that we're

01:22:39.730 --> 01:22:41.440
seeing that aren't
in our jurisdiction

01:22:41.440 --> 01:22:43.944
from an enforcement standpoint
end up being covered.

01:22:43.944 --> 01:22:46.360
Because they have to be dealt
with in an effective fashion

01:22:46.360 --> 01:22:47.230
to protect athletes.

01:22:47.230 --> 01:22:51.070
If we truly care about athletes'
health and safety and fairness,

01:22:51.070 --> 01:22:54.010
we have to deal with these
in a more effective way.

01:22:54.010 --> 01:22:54.510
- Thank you.

01:22:54.510 --> 01:22:56.926
That was really great from all
the different perspectives.

01:22:56.926 --> 01:22:58.600
I appreciate it.

01:22:58.600 --> 01:22:59.100
- Yes?

01:22:59.100 --> 01:23:00.220
Please.

01:23:00.220 --> 01:23:00.910
- Hi.

01:23:00.910 --> 01:23:01.900
My name is Annie Brown.

01:23:01.900 --> 01:23:04.970
I'm an alum of Harvard College
and that Radcliffe rugby team.

01:23:04.970 --> 01:23:06.930
And I also had my third
ACL reconstruction

01:23:06.930 --> 01:23:10.330
at the age of 19, so I was
particularly interested in some

01:23:10.330 --> 01:23:13.420
of the data you were
showing about, like, sort

01:23:13.420 --> 01:23:15.520
of biomechanical
injuries for girls,

01:23:15.520 --> 01:23:17.950
and whether you're sense
of the solution to that

01:23:17.950 --> 01:23:20.290
is just that girls
aren't getting access

01:23:20.290 --> 01:23:22.510
and support to go to
strength and conditioning,

01:23:22.510 --> 01:23:24.790
kind of lateral movement,
that sort of coaching?

01:23:24.790 --> 01:23:28.099
Or whether there's actual, kind
of female-specific programs

01:23:28.099 --> 01:23:30.140
that need to be researched
further and developed,

01:23:30.140 --> 01:23:36.090
that treat women's
mechanics differently?

01:23:36.090 --> 01:23:38.866
- Well great question.

01:23:38.866 --> 01:23:42.110
, So we're in the middle
of actually our first round

01:23:42.110 --> 01:23:44.950
of data analysis of 30
million data points.

01:23:44.950 --> 01:23:48.740
And the articles
are probably going

01:23:48.740 --> 01:23:51.740
to be coming out, the
more definitive ones,

01:23:51.740 --> 01:23:53.720
in about a year from now.

01:23:53.720 --> 01:23:59.990
But a couple of highlights--
so, if we look at soccer,

01:23:59.990 --> 01:24:02.750
the biggest concussion
risk in soccer

01:24:02.750 --> 01:24:05.330
is actually in the
act of heading.

01:24:05.330 --> 01:24:09.860
But for men, it's head-to-head
and elbow-to-head.

01:24:09.860 --> 01:24:13.610
For women, it's head-to-ground.

01:24:13.610 --> 01:24:18.050
In ice hockey, the
biggest singular event

01:24:18.050 --> 01:24:20.860
that causes more concussion in
women in ice hockey than men,

01:24:20.860 --> 01:24:22.430
is head-to-ice.

01:24:22.430 --> 01:24:25.460
And ice is more
unforgiving than concrete.

01:24:25.460 --> 01:24:28.190
For men it's head-to-board
and elbow-to-head.

01:24:28.190 --> 01:24:31.160
So something fundamentally
different is happening.

01:24:31.160 --> 01:24:33.440
Also, if we analyze soccer--

01:24:33.440 --> 01:24:35.790
and we must think this way.

01:24:35.790 --> 01:24:37.250
And I had mentioned
testosterone,

01:24:37.250 --> 01:24:42.260
and so it shifts
even your ability

01:24:42.260 --> 01:24:44.450
for scapulothoracic control.

01:24:44.450 --> 01:24:47.330
And if you analyze how
young women head the ball,

01:24:47.330 --> 01:24:49.310
it's more often up here.

01:24:49.310 --> 01:24:53.060
Whereas men, young men, are
heading the ball properly here.

01:24:53.060 --> 01:24:54.710
When you are heading
the ball up here,

01:24:54.710 --> 01:24:58.070
you have a sudden rotational
force that you should not have.

01:24:58.070 --> 01:25:00.800
Now, we don't understand all of
the biomechanics of that yet.

01:25:00.800 --> 01:25:02.380
So, I think we're early on.

01:25:02.380 --> 01:25:05.770
And we are actually
putting sensors in it

01:25:05.770 --> 01:25:09.050
a large number of individuals
that are playing soccer.

01:25:09.050 --> 01:25:11.940
And I think we'll have
that data in two years.

01:25:11.940 --> 01:25:14.060
But but the most
important thing I can say

01:25:14.060 --> 01:25:16.010
is that fundamentally
concussions in women

01:25:16.010 --> 01:25:18.560
has been ignored, largely.

01:25:18.560 --> 01:25:21.190
And this study is
addressing that.

01:25:21.190 --> 01:25:26.450
We have I think 800
concussion in women

01:25:26.450 --> 01:25:29.090
that we were studying
in great detail.

01:25:29.090 --> 01:25:31.580
But the final thing
I'll say is, I'm not

01:25:31.580 --> 01:25:36.070
certain concussion
is the right metric.

01:25:36.070 --> 01:25:39.430
It may be repetitive
head impact exposure.

01:25:39.430 --> 01:25:41.656
And so, we have to be
mindful of that, as well.

01:25:46.140 --> 01:25:47.350
- My name is Vicky.

01:25:47.350 --> 01:25:48.780
I'm a freshman at the college.

01:25:48.780 --> 01:25:50.340
I had a question
about transitioning

01:25:50.340 --> 01:25:54.180
from playing sport for
fun into an elite level.

01:25:54.180 --> 01:25:57.100
You mentioned how, like,
it's bad to specialize.

01:25:57.100 --> 01:25:59.070
But I feel like when
you do, ultimately,

01:25:59.070 --> 01:26:00.778
if your goal is to
play for the Olympics,

01:26:00.778 --> 01:26:03.690
or to play for varsity
college, if you look at,

01:26:03.690 --> 01:26:05.574
like my friends who
were on varsity teams,

01:26:05.574 --> 01:26:06.990
you have to start
at a young level

01:26:06.990 --> 01:26:09.030
in order to be able to
compete at that level.

01:26:09.030 --> 01:26:12.109
And I was wondering,
I could be wrong,

01:26:12.109 --> 01:26:13.650
but it's like, for
a lot of students,

01:26:13.650 --> 01:26:14.774
you do have to start young.

01:26:14.774 --> 01:26:18.570
And I was wondering, in terms of
addressing this issue, in terms

01:26:18.570 --> 01:26:21.090
of, I guess not
specializing, are we

01:26:21.090 --> 01:26:23.550
supposed to change the
whole way we view sports,

01:26:23.550 --> 01:26:25.837
in terms of winning
and competitiveness?

01:26:25.837 --> 01:26:27.420
And I feel like,
because the thing is,

01:26:27.420 --> 01:26:29.610
this whole body of the
Olympics, it's like,

01:26:29.610 --> 01:26:30.600
why do people compete?

01:26:30.600 --> 01:26:33.120
And then it's like, you compare
countries by how many medals

01:26:33.120 --> 01:26:35.770
you have, which is
defined by winning.

01:26:35.770 --> 01:26:37.590
And then, I think that
just trickles down

01:26:37.590 --> 01:26:40.307
to like you have to start
playing a sport when you're

01:26:40.307 --> 01:26:41.890
really young and
specializing in order

01:26:41.890 --> 01:26:43.980
to ultimately reach that level.

01:26:43.980 --> 01:26:46.800
And what are the
ways to address this?

01:26:46.800 --> 01:26:48.150
- So it's a great question.

01:26:48.150 --> 01:26:51.780
Again, being data-driven, if you
look at the Olympic medalists,

01:26:51.780 --> 01:26:53.850
most of them were multi-sport.

01:26:53.850 --> 01:26:56.396
And so, there's a
difference between--

01:26:56.396 --> 01:27:02.470
and there's a great American
football coach at Ohio State,

01:27:02.470 --> 01:27:04.020
and he said, how
does he determined

01:27:04.020 --> 01:27:05.940
who he chooses as athletes?

01:27:05.940 --> 01:27:07.710
The number 1 thing
he looks at first,

01:27:07.710 --> 01:27:10.110
is those that played
five sports or more.

01:27:10.110 --> 01:27:11.190
So, that's Urban Meyer.

01:27:11.190 --> 01:27:13.350
But let's go to the
fundamental question.

01:27:13.350 --> 01:27:15.420
There is a difference
between early initiation

01:27:15.420 --> 01:27:17.810
and early specialization.

01:27:17.810 --> 01:27:20.750
And if you want to be an Olympic
athlete, there's no question.

01:27:20.750 --> 01:27:24.170
You have to initiate in
sport at a young age.

01:27:24.170 --> 01:27:26.060
But playing multiple
sports allows

01:27:26.060 --> 01:27:29.090
you to develop what's called
"athleticism," as opposed

01:27:29.090 --> 01:27:29.870
to being a player.

01:27:29.870 --> 01:27:31.430
So, look at data again--

01:27:31.430 --> 01:27:34.340
if you wanted to be a great
baseball player, and you

01:27:34.340 --> 01:27:37.670
look at ESPN Little League World
Series over the last 30 years

01:27:37.670 --> 01:27:40.250
and track every single one
of the pitchers at age 12.

01:27:40.250 --> 01:27:41.120
They all had beards.

01:27:41.120 --> 01:27:43.460
They were all throwing
100-mile-an-hour fastballs.

01:27:43.460 --> 01:27:45.800
And they were winning the
World Series at age 12.

01:27:45.800 --> 01:27:47.480
Not one has pitched
in major league

01:27:47.480 --> 01:27:49.200
baseball on a regular basis.

01:27:49.200 --> 01:27:51.740
So that's the development
of a player at a young age,

01:27:51.740 --> 01:27:53.090
versus an athlete.

01:27:53.090 --> 01:27:58.670
And USA Basketball just came
out with an exceptional document

01:27:58.670 --> 01:28:01.760
on how you can become an
elite-level basketball player.

01:28:01.760 --> 01:28:06.830
It's early initiation, but
you don't start totally

01:28:06.830 --> 01:28:09.140
specializing until
you are really

01:28:09.140 --> 01:28:10.430
beyond the age of puberty.

01:28:10.430 --> 01:28:13.480
So, that's the American
development model, as well.

01:28:13.480 --> 01:28:18.110
And all 47 NBGs in this
country have signed on to it.

01:28:18.110 --> 01:28:21.830
But we just haven't gotten
beyond the hype and the craze

01:28:21.830 --> 01:28:24.642
of the parents and the
kids who think they have

01:28:24.642 --> 01:28:25.850
to specialize at a young age.

01:28:25.850 --> 01:28:27.393
The data don't support that.

01:28:27.393 --> 01:28:28.240
- That's right.

01:28:28.240 --> 01:28:29.110
Thank you.

01:28:29.110 --> 01:28:31.950
OK, I think we need to wrap up.

01:28:31.950 --> 01:28:34.520
So I want to thank our panelists
for a fantastic discussion.

01:28:34.520 --> 01:28:36.115
Many thanks to the audience.

01:28:36.115 --> 01:28:38.240
They were really great
questions, great discussion.

01:28:38.240 --> 01:28:39.210
[APPLAUSE]
