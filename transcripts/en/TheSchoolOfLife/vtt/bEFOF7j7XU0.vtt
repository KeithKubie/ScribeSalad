00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:06.460
From the outside, people's minds seem like pretty  straightforward places.

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:11.120
What we hear people saying suggests a certain logic, order and coherence.

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:15.100
But inside the mind, it's a VERY different matter.

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:20.920
Here, things are infinitely more complex, fractured, multilayered, and confusing

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:27.100
Amidst the shadowy tangled darkness, one could imagine a single brightly lit zone

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:28.700
like a spotlight in a cave.

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:31.720
The area that normally goes by the term

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:33.020
"consciousness".

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:35.020
This is where we do our rational thinking.

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:40.160
Where ideas are clarified, where plans are put on a systematic footing,

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.680
where we order and clean up our thoughts

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.680
but the key thing about the way we work

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:50.560
is that unless we take very special measures, most of what is inside the mind

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.840
will remain far outside the spotlight of consciousness

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.700
in what we can call the "unconscious zones".

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:05.560
These unconscious zones contain recesses and grottos filled with unknown disavowed

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:07.320
thoughts and feelings

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:11.680
feelings you HAD, without properly experiencing

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:15.460
emotions we FELT without properly registering

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:20.640
Here, we find our record of pretty much everything we've ever seen

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.020
Where we been to, who we've met, and how we felt.

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.680
Most of the time, the images are dormant and submerged, then occasionally,

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.700
at what can feel like random points,

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:35.260
an image will suddenly come back to us as clear as day

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:41.180
suddenly, we'll see Uncle Ernie or the pier in Britain or the train taking us up the Matterhorn

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:42.640
When we were nine

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:45.940
A lot of what lies in the unconscious are worries,

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.960
things were frightened might happen

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:49.960
at which we push out of consciousness

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:51.960
We keep them at bay

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:57.020
but the effort creates a hum and static of background anxiety

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:58.120
In the unconscious,

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:04.060
the (there are) desires that can't find a place in our more ordered, sensible, day-to-day lives

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.340
there are ideas we haven't had time to sort out

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.240
and angry, hurt feelings we haven't digested

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.420
a sadness we haven't dared to feel

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.000
When we speak of getting to know ourselves,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
of increasing self-knowledge,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.720
really what we mean is the task of getting more active with the spotlight of consciousness

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.540
moving it around more regularly in our minds

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.320
more systematically

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:32.500
shining its beams into unfamiliar corners

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:37.900
so that we're less surprised and frightened by some of what we have in our minds

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:42.560
our founding belief is that the more of the mind we can light up with consciousness,

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:46.240
the more peaceful, coherent and focused we can be.

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:50.060
this is what it means to lead an examined life

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:55.540
to try to become less of a stranger to oneself by illuminating our minds

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:57.540
with a spotlight of consciousness.
