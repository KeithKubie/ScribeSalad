00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:01.590
- [Instructor] We are asked, Which table

00:00:01.590 --> 00:00:05.763
has a constant of proportionality
between y and x of 0.6?

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:10.440
Pause this video and see
if you can figure that out.

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.050
All right, so just as a reminder,

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:15.290
the constant of proportionality
between y and x,

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:16.260
one way to think about it

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.500
is that y is equal to
some constant times x.

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:22.970
Y is proportional to x.

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:24.470
And this constant right over here

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:27.230
is our constant of proportionality.

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:29.280
So if that's going to be 0.6,

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:30.600
so in our tables,

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:31.950
or in the table that has

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:34.690
a constant of proportionality of 0.6,

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:38.380
y should be equal to 0.6 times x

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:40.830
for every x,y pair.

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:43.000
So let's look at these choices.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.130
So is seven 0.6 times four?

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:49.290
Well, no, seven is larger than four.

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:51.833
0.6 times four would actually be 2.4,

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.100
so this one is not gonna be,

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:56.210
is definitely not going to have

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:58.740
a constant of proportionality of 0.6.

00:00:58.740 --> 00:00:59.900
And in fact, this table,

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.800
this isn't even a
proportional relationship.

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.070
For this first one,

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:06.400
I would have to multiply by 7/4.

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.340
And then here I'm going
to be multiplying by 10/6,

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.020
which is equivalent to 5/3.

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:14.910
And here I'm multiplying by 13/8,

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:17.940
so I'm not multiplying by
the same constant every time.

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:21.540
So this isn't even a
proportional relationship.

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.430
Now let's look at choice B.

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.980
Well, to go from four to 2.4, that is.

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:27.463
You would multiply by 0.6.

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.120
But that's not enough for us to say

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:32.840
that this is truly a
proportional relationship.

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:34.820
It would have to be 0.6 in every scenario.

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:35.653
So let's see.

00:01:35.653 --> 00:01:39.260
Nine times 0.6, yeah, that is 5.4.

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.060
Nine times six is 54.

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:43.180
But now this is nine times 6/10.

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:46.190
It's 54 divided by 10, which is 5.4.

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:50.270
And now let's see, 14 times six is 84.

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:53.620
So 14 times 6/10 would indeed be 8.4.

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:56.990
So this looks like our choice.

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:59.550
And we can verify that
this would not be the case.

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:01.110
Let's see, three,

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.250
to get to two we would
be multiplying by 2/3.

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:07.170
And then here, once again,
we're multiplying by 2/3.

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.883
And then here, once again,
we're multiplying by 2/3.

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.690
So this is actually describing
a proportional relationship,

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:17.980
but our constant of
proportionality here is 2/3,

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.200
which, if you tried to
express it as a decimal,

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.500
it would be 0.6 repeating.

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.290
2/3 is equal to 0.6 repeating.

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:29.420
And so it is proportional
but does not have

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.900
this constant of proportionality.

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.343
So we like our choice B.
