you<00:08:29.140><c> would</c><00:08:29.290><c> think</c><00:08:29.470><c> they</c><00:08:30.190><c> if</c><00:08:31.150><c> they</c><00:08:31.450><c> wanted</c><00:08:31.930><c> more</c>

00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:32.290 align:start position:0%
you would think they if they wanted more
 

00:08:32.290 --> 00:08:34.920 align:start position:0%
you would think they if they wanted more
of<00:08:32.530><c> like</c><00:08:32.770><c> the</c><00:08:33.220><c> surgery</c><00:08:33.580><c> and</c><00:08:34.120><c> the</c><00:08:34.270><c> gore</c><00:08:34.510><c> and</c>

00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:34.930 align:start position:0%
of like the surgery and the gore and
 

00:08:34.930 --> 00:08:36.570 align:start position:0%
of like the surgery and the gore and
stuff<00:08:35.230><c> like</c><00:08:35.500><c> that</c><00:08:35.800><c> and</c><00:08:36.040><c> that's</c><00:08:36.370><c> what</c><00:08:36.550><c> the</c>

00:08:36.570 --> 00:08:36.580 align:start position:0%
stuff like that and that's what the
 

00:08:36.580 --> 00:08:40.020 align:start position:0%
stuff like that and that's what the
other<00:08:36.670><c> two</c><00:08:37.150><c> do</c><00:08:37.900><c> apparently</c><00:08:38.530><c> and</c><00:08:38.950><c> to</c><00:08:39.760><c> me</c><00:08:39.910><c> it</c>

00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:40.030 align:start position:0%
other two do apparently and to me it
 

00:08:40.030 --> 00:08:42.060 align:start position:0%
other two do apparently and to me it
sounds<00:08:40.360><c> more</c><00:08:40.480><c> like</c><00:08:40.540><c> if</c><00:08:40.930><c> the</c><00:08:41.050><c> gore</c><00:08:41.290><c> you</c><00:08:41.950><c> know</c>

00:08:42.060 --> 00:08:42.070 align:start position:0%
sounds more like if the gore you know
 

00:08:42.070 --> 00:08:43.710 align:start position:0%
sounds more like if the gore you know
it's<00:08:42.250><c> over-the-top</c><00:08:42.730><c> and</c><00:08:42.880><c> that</c><00:08:43.060><c> one</c><00:08:43.240><c> that</c><00:08:43.450><c> like</c>

00:08:43.710 --> 00:08:43.720 align:start position:0%
it's over-the-top and that one that like
 

00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:45.870 align:start position:0%
it's over-the-top and that one that like
I<00:08:43.960><c> would</c><00:08:44.410><c> just</c><00:08:44.440><c> sort</c><00:08:44.680><c> of</c><00:08:44.770><c> be</c><00:08:44.830><c> used</c><00:08:45.400><c> to</c><00:08:45.610><c> it</c><00:08:45.760><c> in</c>

00:08:45.870 --> 00:08:45.880 align:start position:0%
I would just sort of be used to it in
 

00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:47.190 align:start position:0%
