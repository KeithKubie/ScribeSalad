Well, there are lots of features within
Google Analytics, but the top three that

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:06.689
I would say that are really important,
the first one is measuring events.

00:00:06.689 --> 00:00:09.460
And events is learning how to
measure user engagement and

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:11.460
with an interactive
content like buttons or

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.910
videos, or any other media
that's inside the app itself.

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.448
The second one is measuring
in-app payments or

00:00:17.448 --> 00:00:19.548
transactions that are within the app.

00:00:19.548 --> 00:00:21.898
And the third one is measuring
your campaign effectiveness.

00:00:21.898 --> 00:00:25.333
So this is how you can implement
campaign measurement to understand

00:00:25.333 --> 00:00:29.020
which channels and campaigns are doing
app installs for your app today.
