00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Let's see--we've learned that work and energy have an intimate relationship

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
namely that total work causes a change in kinetic energy and we see the energy is conserved.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
The total amount never changes.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Now, what's really fascinating is that even though the total amount never changes,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
energy can change forms and that's when potential energy comes in.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
We can think of this as the potential to do work.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Now, I can think of what sort of situations involved potential energy.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
It's often the case that things that are very frightening have high potential energy.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Which of these situations, tell me what you think has more potential energy?

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
A rock teetering in a high cliff versus a low,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
a 12-volt car battery versus a small AA battery with 1.5 volts,

00:00:40.000 --> 99:59:59.000
a lit stick of dynamite versus a lit twig, and a drawn bone arrow versus a relax one.
