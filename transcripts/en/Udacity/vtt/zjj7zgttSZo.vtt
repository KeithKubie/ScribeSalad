00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:02.969
When monetizing an e-commerce site,

00:00:02.969 --> 00:00:06.450
there are four main principles
you should keep in mind.

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.600
First, let users explore
before they commit.

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:12.740
Second, let users purchase as guest.

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:16.320
Third, make it easy to
finish from another device.

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.050
Four, use existing information
to maximize the convenience.

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:22.425
Now let's go deeper on each rule.

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:28.853
Requiring a log in or account creation
too early in a site experience can be

00:00:28.853 --> 00:00:30.531
harmful to conversions.

00:00:30.531 --> 00:00:33.921
Beware of making enemies
at registration gates.

00:00:33.921 --> 00:00:37.480
Don't require customer account
registration up front.

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.480
We understand that getting access
to the customer information and

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.760
preferences can be integral
to your website success.

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.390
But don't ask for
it too early in the process.

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:48.560
You can see here on the left side,

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:54.170
an example of a pop-up that could block
the users from achieving her goals.

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:57.450
However, here on the right side,
you could be productive and

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:58.780
browse the site right away.

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.520
Offer the option to
check out as a guest and

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.990
encourage registration
with tangible benefits.

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:10.710
If purchasing is something that people
can do on your website, then you want to

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.850
aim for the option to clearly enable
users to check out as guests.

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:19.310
The guest option is universally
preferred when users didn't have

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:20.630
an existing account.

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.290
At the end of the guest
checkout process,

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:28.820
you have another opportunity to
get users to create an account.

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:32.260
And you can communicate tangible
benefits to them for doing so, for

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:35.730
example, so
that they could track their order.

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:40.260
Also remember that you don't
want to negate the benefits of

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:44.810
free users' purchase by having
a process that isn't smooth here.

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.590
All browsers including the ability
to auto complete forms, so

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:50.630
make sure you are using them.

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:56.980
Offer an easy way to save or
share information across devices,

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:01.660
providing functionality to allow
users to pick up where they left off.

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:04.730
Seek opportunities to
scaffold users behavior and

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:09.180
facilitate cross-channel conversion
through your mobile website.

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:13.240
Your users move from one
device to another, or

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:17.230
simply want to go back to where
they were on the same device.

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.596
This functionality
could help them a lot.

00:02:19.596 --> 00:02:24.000
As you could see here, they could email
it or share it on social networks.

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:29.110
Please take advantage of
information you already have or

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:34.750
use third party payment service to
make conversion as easy as possible.

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:37.700
Another useful way to streamline
the conversion's experience for

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.360
users is to know and

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:44.550
use what already exists in terms of
information that the user has provided.

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:49.230
We also find that autofilling, when
possible, was a huge benefit to users.
