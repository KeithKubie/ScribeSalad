well to be honest I had a very

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:02.870
well to be honest I had a very
 

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:06.619
well to be honest I had a very
variegated early career I worked in

00:00:06.619 --> 00:00:06.629
variegated early career I worked in
 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:11.990
variegated early career I worked in
various jobs and I at one point I was an

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000
various jobs and I at one point I was an
 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.379
various jobs and I at one point I was an
engineer working making airplanes and

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389
engineer working making airplanes and
 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:16.910
engineer working making airplanes and
while I was studying engineering I

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920
while I was studying engineering I
 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.330
while I was studying engineering I
became interested in philosophy and

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:19.340
became interested in philosophy and
 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:21.500
became interested in philosophy and
particularly in those areas of

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510
particularly in those areas of
 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.300
particularly in those areas of
philosophy which were dealing with the

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310
philosophy which were dealing with the
 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.089
philosophy which were dealing with the
mind-body problem how things were

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099
mind-body problem how things were
 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.840
mind-body problem how things were
represented in the mind and and things

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850
represented in the mind and and things
 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.319
represented in the mind and and things
like that and I began to think that it

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329
like that and I began to think that it
 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.130
like that and I began to think that it
was just possible that if we understood

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140
was just possible that if we understood
 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.380
was just possible that if we understood
more about the brain we will be able to

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390
more about the brain we will be able to
 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.200
more about the brain we will be able to
understand some of the problems which

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210
understand some of the problems which
 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:46.790
understand some of the problems which
people had been dealing with prefer

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800
people had been dealing with prefer

centuries in paignton millennia so I set

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340
centuries in paignton millennia so I set
 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.939
centuries in paignton millennia so I set
out on the course where I decided it

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949
out on the course where I decided it
 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.040
out on the course where I decided it
would be great to study the brain in

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050
would be great to study the brain in
 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.840
would be great to study the brain in
those days there wasn't anything called

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850
those days there wasn't anything called
 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.299
those days there wasn't anything called
neuroscience there were several people

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309
neuroscience there were several people
 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.220
neuroscience there were several people
studying the brain but it wasn't a very

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230
studying the brain but it wasn't a very
 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.070
studying the brain but it wasn't a very
developed subject so i went to back to

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080
developed subject so i went to back to
 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.100
developed subject so i went to back to
university full time and ended up doing

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110
university full time and ended up doing
 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.870
university full time and ended up doing
psychology because it was one of the few

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880
psychology because it was one of the few
 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.230
psychology because it was one of the few
areas where you could study study the

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240
areas where you could study study the
 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.010
areas where you could study study the
brain so i came to the field of studying

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020
brain so i came to the field of studying
 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.230
brain so i came to the field of studying
brain neuroscience really through my

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240
brain neuroscience really through my
 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.109
brain neuroscience really through my
interest in philosophy and trying to

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119
interest in philosophy and trying to
 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.580
interest in philosophy and trying to
answer some of the fundamental questions

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590
answer some of the fundamental questions
 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.469
answer some of the fundamental questions
i think i've been very lucky that it

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479
i think i've been very lucky that it
 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.450
i think i've been very lucky that it
turns out that i have made a

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460
turns out that i have made a
 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.450
turns out that i have made a
contribution towards one of those those

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460
contribution towards one of those those
 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.450
contribution towards one of those those
questions and i'm very fortunate that

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460
questions and i'm very fortunate that
 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.030
questions and i'm very fortunate that
