00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:04.450
We've already seen that the
fraction 2/5, or fractions

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:08.390
like the fraction 2/5, can
be literally represented

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:18.280
as 2 times 1/5, which
is the same thing, which

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:21.950
is equal to literally
having two 1/5s.

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:24.920
So 1/5 plus 1/5.

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:26.690
And if we wanted
to visualize it,

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:28.380
let me make a hole
here and divide it

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.610
into five equal sections.

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:34.140
And so this represents
two of those fifths.

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.940
This is the first of the
fifths, and then this

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:43.430
is the second of the fifths,
Literally 2/5, 2/5, 2/5.

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:46.070
Now let's think about something
a little bit more interesting.

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:50.350
What would 3 times
2/5 represent?

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:53.820
3 times 2/5.

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.580
And I encourage you
to pause this video

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:57.079
and, based on what
we just did here,

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:01.260
think about what you think
this would be equivalent to.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.290
Well, we just saw that 2/5
would be the same thing

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:07.100
as-- so let me just
rewrite this as instead

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.720
of 3 times 2/5
written like this,

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.950
let me write 2/5
like that-- so this

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:17.120
is the same thing as
3 times 2 times 1/5.

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:26.930
And multiplication, we can
multiply the 2 times the 1/5

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:29.000
first and then
multiply by the 3,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.990
or we can multiply the 3
times the 2 first and then

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:33.890
multiply by the 1/5.

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:38.800
So you could view this literally
as being equal to 3 times 2

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:44.790
is, of course, 6, so this is
the same thing as 6 times 1/5.

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:50.060
And if we were to try
to visualize that again,

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.090
so that's a whole.

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:53.690
That's another whole.

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:55.490
Each of those wholes
have been divided

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:58.190
into five equal sections.

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:01.850
And so we're going to
color in six of them.

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:09.009
So that's the first 1/5, second
1/5, third 1/5, fourth 1/5,

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:10.930
fifth 1/5-- and that
gets us to a whole--

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:15.320
and then we have
6/5 just like that.

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:20.370
So literally 3 times 2/5
can be viewed as 6/5.

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.130
And of course, 6
times 1/5, or 6/5,

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:26.660
can be written as--
so this is equal to,

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:36.530
literally-- let me do the
same color-- 6/5, 6 over 5.

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:39.440
Now you might have said, well,
what if we, instead of viewing

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.000
2/5 as this, as we just
did in this example,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.200
we view 2/5 as 1/5 plus
1/5, what would happen then?

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:46.870
Well, let's try it out.

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:57.260
So 3 times 2/5-- I'll rewrite
it-- 3 times 2/5, 2 over 5,

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:04.360
is the same thing as
3 times 1/5 plus 1/5.

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:07.010
2/5 is the same thing
as 1/5 plus 1/5.

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:11.650
So 3 times 1/5 plus
1/5 which would

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:14.440
be equal to-- well, I just
have to have literally

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:15.970
three of these added together.

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:22.020
So it's going to be
1/5 plus 1/5 plus 1/5

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:26.150
plus 1/5 plus-- I think
you get the idea here--

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:30.560
plus 1/5 plus 1/5.

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:31.930
Well, what's this going to be?

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:34.860
Well, we literally
have 6/5 here.

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:37.291
We can ignore the parentheses
and just add all of these

00:03:37.291 --> 00:03:37.790
together.

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:43.130
We, once again, have
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6/5.

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:45.940
So once again, this
is equal to 6/5.

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:47.360
So hopefully this
shows that when

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:52.850
you multiply-- The 2/5 we saw
already represents two 1/5s.

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:55.280
We already saw that,
or 2 times 1/5.

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:59.830
And 3 times 2/5 is literally
the same thing as 3 times

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:01.730
2 times 1/5.

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:04.608
In this case, that would be 6/5.
