RAEGAN KELLY JOHNSON:
Archives, to me, mean stories.

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:13.540
Stories that are told
that can connect the past

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:14.840
to the present.

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:17.170
And I think that is why it's
just so important that we

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:20.574
continue to fund
programs such as this,

00:00:20.574 --> 00:00:22.740
so that we can just have
the opportunity to continue

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.632
to tell this narrative.

00:00:26.632 --> 00:00:29.430
DAN LINKE: ARCH stands
for Archives Research

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:31.270
and Collaborative History.

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:33.870
And it is a pilot
program to bring students

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.140
from the historically black
colleges and universities

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.490
to Princeton for a week to
learn about archival practice.

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:42.240
ALEXIS ANTRACOLI: We're
doing a little bit

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:45.210
of lecture and
discussion, activities,

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.400
where they can do some hands-on
work with our collections.

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:52.510
So they're learning about how
archival research is done.

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:54.330
And we're also talking
about critiques

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:56.625
of the archival
profession, and bringing

00:00:56.625 --> 00:01:00.066
in social justice critiques.

00:01:00.066 --> 00:01:02.250
MADISON WASHINGTON:
Interpretation changes,

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.870
depending on the perspective,
depending on the person.

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:08.010
So if I'm able to go back to
something that was read 20

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.450
years ago, and bring a new
look onto it, then that's --

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.620
not having that will be
a missed opportunity.

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:16.560
So I think archives
are important to have,

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.395
because you're able
to go back and see

00:01:18.395 --> 00:01:20.520
what was being discussed,
what was being looked at,

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:21.810
what was being done.

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.566
Bring a new
interpretation to it.

00:01:24.566 --> 00:01:28.230
TONY BOUNDS: These
documents, these artifacts,

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:31.110
objects, they're from
particular periods.

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.720
And these particular
periods evoke

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.930
particular social evolution,
whether it's the civil rights

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.810
movement, whether it's
the antebellum period,

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.960
whether it's American
Reconstruction.

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.330
It's a glimpse into the past.

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:48.630
And in many instances,
it's a glimpse into today,

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.390
because every day,
we make history.

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.260
KIMBERLY MONROE: Archives
are vital to the existence

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.470
of Africana people
in this world.

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:01.440
With archives, we're
able to make a connection

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:03.960
to our descendants
because, in a way,

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.210
they've met us
through the archives.

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.250
So it's like all
of these historical

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.846
and present and future
moments are tied together.

00:02:12.846 --> 00:02:15.240
ANNE JARVIS: Working
together with colleagues

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:18.540
from historically black
colleges and universities

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.620
on this program has meant
that we are providing students

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.020
with practical
ways in which they

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:29.830
can work on their archives back
in their home institutions.

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:32.730
SARAH TROTTY: So many
students don't know much

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:33.960
about the archival field.

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:35.550
So I feel it's
important for them

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:39.690
to have the experience to at
least have a look, a real close

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:43.300
look, at what archival
work provides.

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:45.120
Whether they're
interested in history

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.930
or interested in visual art,
or interested in writing,

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:50.970
they'll see the
connectivity, they'll

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:55.680
see the chance to
preserve, archive

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.982
those things that are very
important to cultural history.

00:02:59.982 --> 00:03:01.890
KIMBERLY MONROE: What
we're doing here today,

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:04.080
and what we've done
all week, is only

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:06.840
the beginning of
what I like to call

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.660
the revolution of archives.

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:14.250
As scholars, as archivists,
as communication experts, what

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:18.360
we do for the world is to make
sure that everyone has a voice,

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.850
is to make sure that we're
not losing that voice,

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:23.130
and making sure that
everyone's voice is heard.

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:24.930
