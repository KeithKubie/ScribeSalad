1
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:05,030
Hey, what's going on? It's Bill Burr and
It's time for the Monday morning. No,

2
00:00:05,031 --> 00:00:09,000
it isn't. God dammit. It's a Thursday
afternoon just before Friday,

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:09,900
Monday morning podcast and

4
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:14,890
Ahhh,

5
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:20,010
just checking in on you and the volumes
too loud and the volumes to love what's

6
00:00:20,921 --> 00:00:24,910
going on. Hey, hey. Hey, test has
two, two, check check two, two.

7
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:29,890
Oh Jesus Christ.
Happy Thanksgiving to you.

8
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:33,530
Happy Thanksgiving to you.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,680
Happy thanksgiving,
United States of America.

10
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:42,893
Ah,

11
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:48,400
happy Thanksgiving to you.

12
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:50,110
What's going on?

13
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:54,670
Happy Thanksgiving to the United
States of America's citizens.

14
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:56,530
Each and every one of you.

15
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:00,560
I am thankful to be in America.

16
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:04,930
Sitting here with my gun,
eating the fucking doughnut,

17
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:07,150
getting fat and having fun.

18
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:10,990
My wife miles off to me going
to slap her in the face,

19
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:15,790
get my sales and pie,
and then make fun of another race.

20
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:18,100
Hey, all right. What's going on?

21
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:21,400
This is it for all you around the world
and you want to know what the fuck at

22
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:24,160
Thanksgiving is all about.
This is what it's about.

23
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:30,010
It's about sitting down and overreading
celebrating the fact that on this day,

24
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:32,620
thanksgiving,
1776,

25
00:01:32,621 --> 00:01:36,160
the United States of America kicked
the shit out of the fucking bread.

26
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:39,880
It's British people at the
battle of thanksgiving.

27
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:45,610
You know, this black dude
Crispus addicts act, acts,

28
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:51,250
Attica, whatever his fucking name
was, he came walking up and he said,

29
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:55,270
he said, Yo, motherfuckers, what's,

30
00:01:55,271 --> 00:01:57,790
what's your powdered wig pitch?
Right?

31
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:02,890
And then the English were like, Whoa,
why you can't talk to me like dad,

32
00:02:02,891 --> 00:02:06,070
especially with dead skin complexion.
Then they tried to shoot him,

33
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:10,120
but he fucking Stab King Henry
the, uh, the eighth. Yeah,

34
00:02:10,121 --> 00:02:13,840
right in the throat with the, uh, with
the Turkey bone, broke his larynx.

35
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:16,690
The guy survived. Really took
it out on his wife, you know,

36
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:19,870
beat her to death with a chastity belt.
This is all true and you can look it up,

37
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:22,840
but at the end of the day,
the end of the day,

38
00:02:22,841 --> 00:02:27,670
that small act was what
created this country. And,

39
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:28,970
um,

40
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:33,970
I'm thankful for Crispus addicts where
his name was going back to my history

41
00:02:35,501 --> 00:02:39,370
classes. You know, was that the
only black guy they talked about?

42
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:43,780
I think it was.
They sort of touched on slavery.

43
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:48,730
Um, all these white guys
did this amazing stuff.

44
00:02:48,731 --> 00:02:52,990
Slavery and then they
built the White House.

45
00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:57,940
Um, anyways, I don't know what the
fuck I'm talking about. Who Cares?

46
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:06,780
Hang on. Here we go. We're back.
We're back. Yeah. I don't give a shit.

47
00:03:06,781 --> 00:03:09,810
This is one of these podcasts. I don't
care. I don't care from entertaining you.

48
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:11,700
I don't care if I'm confusing you.

49
00:03:11,701 --> 00:03:16,340
I don't care if I'm ruining your fucking
meal because I am in a resentful moved.

50
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:19,890
A lot of people are thankful today.
I am not thankful and I'll tell you why.

51
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:21,240
Cause I'm working right now.

52
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:26,100
I'm doing a podcast because you can hear
my daughter screaming in the background.

53
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:29,130
She's already half in the bag.
Everybody's boozing. Evan,

54
00:03:29,131 --> 00:03:33,120
a great time and old Billy.
No Fun little Billy.

55
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:37,950
No Fun is continuing with his streak.
Why is he continued with his streak?

56
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:42,120
Is it cause he's vain?
I don't know why I'm continuing.

57
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:46,370
I just don't want to be a fat
booze bag again. Can I just,

58
00:03:46,371 --> 00:03:48,770
I'm just going to ride out the
rest of the year. I'll see what,

59
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:52,080
I'll see what the vibe is for 2018.
You know,

60
00:03:52,081 --> 00:03:54,990
that first day when I roll out of bed,
I'll see how I feel.

61
00:03:57,210 --> 00:04:00,630
Granted, I'll be at the rose
bowl, so I'll be very excited. Um,

62
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:04,450
which this year is going to be a,
as one of those semifinal playoffs.

63
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:10,140
I think the Miami hurricanes are going to
be there. Um, somebody was saying that,

64
00:04:10,141 --> 00:04:14,880
I have no idea. All I know is I'm
going, I'm going right that, that,

65
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:15,691
that's what I did.

66
00:04:15,691 --> 00:04:20,430
I bought some tickets for myself and my
friends for the Rose Bowl because I was

67
00:04:20,431 --> 00:04:25,020
giving thanks to living in this wonderful
country that has the stadiums that you

68
00:04:25,021 --> 00:04:26,790
can go to,
right.

69
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:31,560
It used to be able to get drunk and
have a good time. Can't do that anymore.

70
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,140
You can't do that anymore.

71
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:40,770
Somebody was jerking off vigorously with
the fucking shrimp cocktail and now to

72
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:45,970
everybody, shut it down. It's
going to be no fun anymore.

73
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:50,680
No Fun in the comedy clubs,
Dude.

74
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:53,950
Fucking the vibe and comedy clubs,
depending on what you talk about,

75
00:04:53,951 --> 00:04:57,370
if you talk about absolutely nothing,
I'm sure nothing has changed,

76
00:04:57,371 --> 00:05:00,520
but if you even remotely
touch on fucking anything,

77
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:05,770
there's so many subjects now and these
fucking millennials, they swear to God,

78
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:09,100
they just, they just sit there.
It's like doing a cruise ship Gig.

79
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:11,100
Yeah.

80
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:13,980
Can you imagine, sorry,
didn't mean to scream,

81
00:05:13,981 --> 00:05:18,720
but can you imagine the fucking midlife
crisis that millennials are going to

82
00:05:18,721 --> 00:05:21,960
have?
They're not having any fun.

83
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:24,750
This sitting around staring
at the goddamn screens,

84
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:29,490
they're afraid to say anything.
Everything's been judged and labeled.

85
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:34,550
It's like this, this fucking bizarre
like way back in the day, hey,

86
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:37,770
back in the day they, they used
to say that the government, right,

87
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:39,810
they're going to come down on you,
man.

88
00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:42,900
They're going to take away free speech
man and Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

89
00:05:42,901 --> 00:05:44,730
Wasn't social media.

90
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:50,430
Social media has made
everything so fucking important.

91
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:53,730
Your quote,
everybody's on eggshells.

92
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:55,770
It's really different.

93
00:05:55,771 --> 00:06:00,771
The amount of times I have to fucking
sit there is almost a 50 year old man and

94
00:06:00,801 --> 00:06:02,840
tell young people to snap out of it.

95
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:09,160
And then they always applaud like, Yay, we
want to snap on it. But what did it say?

96
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:13,940
I'm calling this right now.

97
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:15,440
Yeah.

98
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:18,290
I don't know what's gonna come out of
this at the very least is going to be a

99
00:06:18,291 --> 00:06:22,940
great wrestling character.
You know, if I were,

100
00:06:22,941 --> 00:06:26,720
if I actually could take the beating,
the punishment of professional wrestling,

101
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:30,530
you know, and I was a younger fellow, my
character's name would be the millennial.

102
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:36,170
Right. And I would be
fucking sanctimonious my,
the word I learned this year,

103
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,860
self righteous, which is basically the
same thing. Set in a different way,

104
00:06:39,861 --> 00:06:40,694
isn't it?

105
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:44,450
And I would act like how much I cared and
then I would go into the ring and be a

106
00:06:44,451 --> 00:06:48,350
selfish fucking prick who just cheated
and fucked over everybody all the way to

107
00:06:48,351 --> 00:06:49,760
my victory. Something like that. That's,

108
00:06:49,761 --> 00:06:53,750
that's the loose or maybe maybe it's
not too late for me to be at wrestling

109
00:06:53,751 --> 00:06:54,584
manager.

110
00:06:56,570 --> 00:06:56,780
Yeah.

111
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:59,750
But I'm too old to be a millennial.
I'll be proud of my millennial children.

112
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:02,580
I don't fucking know.
This is why I don't rest.

113
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:07,320
I don't write for the fucking WWF or
whatever they're called now, the WWE,

114
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:13,340
um, Jesus Christ. Jesus' question.

115
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:17,040
How was your guys' Wednesday, just
before thanksgiving. How was it?

116
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:22,050
Did you go to the local bar here?

117
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:23,610
Did you see that lady?

118
00:07:23,611 --> 00:07:28,380
Did you see that fella or maybe you
wanted to bang one of your teachers?

119
00:07:28,381 --> 00:07:33,360
Did you hook up? Did it happen?
If I was a creepy teacher,

120
00:07:33,361 --> 00:07:36,060
that's what I would do. You know
what I mean? To keep my job.

121
00:07:36,061 --> 00:07:37,800
I wouldn't try to bang one of my students,

122
00:07:37,801 --> 00:07:41,550
but I would hit every fucking Wednesday
before Thanksgiving at the local

123
00:07:41,551 --> 00:07:44,820
watering hole, you know,
by then when the fucking,

124
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:49,800
whoever the hell I wanted to
bang was of age and I'd show up,

125
00:07:49,801 --> 00:07:52,770
you know what I mean?
Just fucking chalk dust on my pants.

126
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:59,000
Do a little dance.
Mega little love bug.

127
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:04,910
[inaudible] um, hey ladies, have you ever
gone the Wednesday before thanksgiving?

128
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:10,070
Did you just check in on one
of your teachers? Have you
ever done that? You know,

129
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:13,760
not an old crusty guy, but
that new guy. All right.

130
00:08:13,761 --> 00:08:17,570
The guy who was like in his
thirties seemed like he had
it all together at least

131
00:08:17,571 --> 00:08:20,570
to you when you were sitting in your class
before you realize he's probably make

132
00:08:20,571 --> 00:08:25,160
it only 18 grand a year with no benefits.
Course he has the whole summer off,

133
00:08:25,161 --> 00:08:27,830
which would be great for the
kids and the above ground pool.

134
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:29,490
Yeah.

135
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:34,490
Underrated above ground pool under
fucking rated the above ground pool.

136
00:08:36,031 --> 00:08:38,520
I mean,
how much into the water do you need to be?

137
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:44,280
As long as it goes up to your neck, you're
fine. Right? There isn't one at a time.

138
00:08:44,281 --> 00:08:46,230
You let it freeze over
and you can skate on it.

139
00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:51,290
Actually bill for above ground pool, a
little bottle of water. Shut the fuck up.

140
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:56,020
Nobody cares about your science.
So listen to this.

141
00:08:56,021 --> 00:09:01,021
I told you last week I fucked up my ribs
or I fucking the Cartlidge around them.

142
00:09:01,571 --> 00:09:05,680
I don't know what happened. So, uh,
I went to him with Seuss, you know,

143
00:09:05,681 --> 00:09:08,830
which is what you wanna do.
You want to go to ah, fuck.

144
00:09:08,831 --> 00:09:11,770
You want to go to an as suits, just
sitting up purse. If you want to go to,

145
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:15,130
you want to go to a fucking misuse
that knows what the fuck they're doing.

146
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:18,640
Cause basically all my muscles
were spasms in this guy.

147
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:22,810
Fucking fixed all of it. And I walked
out of there and they felt great.

148
00:09:22,811 --> 00:09:27,670
And then like the German Irish asshole I
was, I'm like, well, you know about 60%.

149
00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:31,900
I guess I can go play drums at 100% now
and see what happens that I came out of

150
00:09:31,901 --> 00:09:35,500
there and I felt like I got
hit by a fucking car. Um,

151
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:39,830
you know why it is? Because they'll bill,
he's working on his double bass pedal.

152
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:43,760
He's got the double pedal now.
Huh. And you know what the deal is?

153
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:47,300
If you're a white guy and you're fun and
you're white drummer if you're a warmer,

154
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:51,560
right. What are the first couple of
songs you're going to learn? Huh?

155
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:56,800
Motley Crue live wire before
you move up to Pantera,

156
00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:00,900
uh, cowboys from hell. That's what it is.

157
00:10:00,901 --> 00:10:04,890
And I'm actually finding that fucking
triplet lick is easier than actually just

158
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:09,270
plain 16th 16th pass,
like fucking 95 a hundred bpms.

159
00:10:09,271 --> 00:10:11,430
I just sound like a horse
gallop and down the street.

160
00:10:11,431 --> 00:10:15,390
But what I didn't realize was how
much I was encouraging my obliques.

161
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:20,090
And the right side is all fucked
up. So whatever. I have a, uh,

162
00:10:21,210 --> 00:10:23,310
I have another appointment
next fucking week. But dude,

163
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:25,430
I got to tell you something right now.
You guys out there,

164
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:26,790
all you old fucks like me.

165
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:31,830
If you have aches and pains in your
body before you go to a doctor,

166
00:10:33,530 --> 00:10:36,290
I'm telling you, go see
him as Seuss. All right?

167
00:10:36,291 --> 00:10:41,150
That actually I a top shelf misuse that
knows what that understands the body and

168
00:10:41,151 --> 00:10:44,720
how it fucking works. Cause I'm telling
you right now, if you go to a doctor,

169
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:48,920
you know what they're gonna do. What
is it hard? This is my specialty.

170
00:10:48,921 --> 00:10:49,790
I'm a knee doctor,

171
00:10:49,791 --> 00:10:52,700
so I'm just looking at your fucking
knee and then they're going to give you

172
00:10:52,701 --> 00:10:55,700
prescriptions. They're going to give
you some pain medications, you know,

173
00:10:55,701 --> 00:11:00,400
next thing you know, you're, you're
fucking on heroin. You don't need,

174
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:04,500
Oh you just go to him with Seuss and
not play drums at the end of the day.

175
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:09,270
And I think you'll be fine. As always.
I have no idea what I'm talking about,

176
00:11:09,271 --> 00:11:11,100
but it does warm my heart on thing.

177
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:15,240
I do give thanks right now thinking
that I'm possibly ignoring,

178
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:19,230
not ignoring,
unknowing somebody in the medical field.

179
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:24,170
That's not true on the new dog.

180
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:29,090
Do I take in consideration the hip joint,
the fucking theorics,

181
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:32,930
your larynx, pharynx, the
hypothalamus, pharynx.

182
00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:36,640
I think I just invented a body
part. That's, yeah, that's,

183
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:40,640
it's your thyroid and your
lyrics where they connect.

184
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:42,470
It's like the taint
between the two of them

185
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:48,490
larynx is somewhere in your voicebox and
your thyroid. I don't know where that,

186
00:11:48,491 --> 00:11:53,200
that isn't that in your neck?
Let a swollen thyroid Glenn.

187
00:11:53,890 --> 00:11:55,770
Yeah. And you also got something
on the side of your mouth.

188
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:58,930
So if you don't pick up the conversation,

189
00:11:58,931 --> 00:12:03,130
I'm walking away cause I don't give a
shit about you. Fucking can I say that?

190
00:12:03,131 --> 00:12:06,760
Can I say that in the podcast?
Will I offend thyroid Americans?

191
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:10,840
Um, anyway, so I, uh,

192
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:17,680
I'd fucking made a sweet potato pie first
time this year. And what I learned was,

193
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:22,720
uh, there's no sweet potato and a sweet
potato pie. It's actually fucking yams.

194
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:27,710
I didn't know that I'm white. I
don't know. So I, it was the least,

195
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:32,130
the fucking sweet potatoes I got when I
fucking boiled them and got the skin off

196
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:34,330
them, they will, they will Hawaii.
So I was thinking, all right,

197
00:12:34,331 --> 00:12:37,690
maybe the cinnamon and nutmeg and
that shit turns it Brown. It did not.

198
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:41,430
I basically made a sweet,
uh,

199
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,290
I made a potato pie that had a
little bit of sweetness to it,

200
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:48,970
so I had to fucking get rid of that
thing. Went back, got some yams. You know,

201
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:54,110
you've got to understand people that I'm
essentially going to be one of the few

202
00:12:54,371 --> 00:12:58,570
white people at my Thanksgiving dinner.
And rather than making a Hawaii Pie,

203
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:03,780
I'm making a pie that is the staple of
the black communities as far as I've been

204
00:13:04,031 --> 00:13:07,990
told. So there's all this
fucking pressure. Um,

205
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:11,380
I'm thinking I'm going to take a
pounding today as far as like, you know,

206
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:14,440
I should've put the,
he should put some vanilla in there.

207
00:13:14,441 --> 00:13:17,110
You should have done this. You should've
done that. We'll see what happens.

208
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:20,800
We'll see how I survive.
You know what I mean?

209
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:25,300
Which is probably a good thing that I'm
not drinking today. You know what I mean?

210
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:28,750
Cause then, you know, I would
have all that alcohol in me,

211
00:13:28,751 --> 00:13:33,130
everybody be criticizing my Pi and
then I'd start crying like a sad drunk.

212
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,450
Speaking of sad,
I realize I just fucking set back,

213
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:40,900
which is not what you want to do because
now I've got to make that noise again

214
00:13:40,901 --> 00:13:44,970
when I fucking sit up.
Um, anyways, congrats.

215
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,540
You know what I'm thankful for something
else that I'm thankful for is the

216
00:13:49,541 --> 00:13:51,970
Celtic 16 game winning streak.

217
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:55,930
What an absolute gift
to start off the season.

218
00:13:56,260 --> 00:14:01,260
I'm thankful for Danny Ainge
or as I like to call him,

219
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:06,640
Bill Belicheck Jr Luke,
what this man is doing with draft picks,

220
00:14:06,641 --> 00:14:08,230
look what this guy has done.

221
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:11,770
Anybody can be like the Lakers
and just sit around and go,

222
00:14:11,771 --> 00:14:15,820
who's the best players in the league?
I will have them. Thank you very much.

223
00:14:16,210 --> 00:14:18,010
Oh did you already developed them?

224
00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:23,970
But to actually sit there and hold onto
your draft picks for years and then

225
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:26,890
exquisitely use them to trade,

226
00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:31,270
to move up in the draft to pick
the guys to assemble the pieces.

227
00:14:32,650 --> 00:14:33,940
Who's kidding?
Who were in the east?

228
00:14:33,941 --> 00:14:36,100
So everybody in the east is
doing the exact same thing.

229
00:14:36,130 --> 00:14:39,580
We're waiting for Lebron to get old.
You know?

230
00:14:39,581 --> 00:14:41,980
It's like everybody in
the AFC east and football.

231
00:14:42,010 --> 00:14:46,840
It's just how long is this motherfucker
Tom Brady going to be great for?

232
00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:51,800
You know, you know what the
turning point in his career was,

233
00:14:51,801 --> 00:14:56,050
was getting with Jazelle. All right,
so what she has him on is she eat,

234
00:14:56,051 --> 00:15:00,980
he's like on that fucking wheat grass
yoga diet. He's all flexible and stuff.

235
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:01,843
You know what I mean?

236
00:15:03,290 --> 00:15:08,210
He's eating like a stab
in model. Right? You.

237
00:15:08,430 --> 00:15:13,010
So when he came into the league,
came right in out of the fucking dorms,

238
00:15:13,011 --> 00:15:16,370
eating fucking Jalapeno poppers.
Do they even have those back then?

239
00:15:16,371 --> 00:15:17,540
That's how old he is.
Like,

240
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:20,870
like a new appetizer has come around
since he started in the league.

241
00:15:20,871 --> 00:15:24,110
That's when you know you're old.
You know what I mean?

242
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:28,520
When all you want is those little mini
fucking hot dogs with the mustard on them

243
00:15:29,410 --> 00:15:33,230
and somebody go, we have Jalapeno
poppers. What? What? What are those?

244
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:37,770
I am not familiar with
those. Do you want some? Uh,

245
00:15:37,930 --> 00:15:42,320
what are what set fucking weird one,
not smores. Let's say one. Every.

246
00:15:42,321 --> 00:15:43,850
All those other weird families.

247
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:48,410
You know what the weird families are
that basically people that cook the shit

248
00:15:48,411 --> 00:15:51,500
that you don't eat,
you know that's smores.

249
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:56,000
Not Charlie Brown's, what do they
call him? I said some chocolate thing.

250
00:15:56,450 --> 00:15:58,880
It just sounds like a sweet
name for taking a dump.

251
00:15:58,881 --> 00:16:01,670
I can't remember what the fuck it is.
They always hit. You want one of these?

252
00:16:01,671 --> 00:16:04,550
It's like, no I don't, I don't,

253
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:08,840
I'm hoping the lovely Nia will come
in here and join me at some point on

254
00:16:08,841 --> 00:16:13,280
Thanksgiving,
so I give thanks for having a lovely wife.

255
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:14,943
Yeah,

256
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:19,970
I was hoping that that was going
to happen at some point, you know,

257
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:22,070
you know what,
my wife is like,

258
00:16:22,071 --> 00:16:27,071
she's like Louie Depalma on fucking taxi
as far as the way she always gives me a

259
00:16:28,341 --> 00:16:29,900
fucking other jobs.
Sick.

260
00:16:29,930 --> 00:16:34,930
She's like dispatch every time I'm out
driving around you gotta shut your phone

261
00:16:35,421 --> 00:16:39,470
off. Cause if you don't, you're just
going to get all these assignments. Hey,

262
00:16:39,471 --> 00:16:42,290
are you like 40 miles
away from the dry cleaner?

263
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:45,830
Could you go over there and
pick up some stuff, Neha?

264
00:16:49,950 --> 00:16:52,600
Yeah.
Yes.

265
00:16:54,910 --> 00:16:56,380
I'm in here trashing you.

266
00:16:58,330 --> 00:17:03,270
Happy Thanksgiving to
you, but a boop, boop,

267
00:17:03,271 --> 00:17:06,760
boop, boop. Who Do you guys
like today? You like the
lines? Do you like the cowboys?

268
00:17:06,761 --> 00:17:11,050
Oh, here we go. Oh look
who's here. There she is.

269
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:19,020
Mrs Mrs Burb a Baba Baba Baba [inaudible]
triumphant return making a triumphant

270
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:24,260
return. Aw Man, I was just trashing you.
Can you, uh, can you pull up the, uh,

271
00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:28,930
did your chair there? I was comparing
you to Louie Depalma on taxi member.

272
00:17:28,931 --> 00:17:32,500
How he's in dispatch and it was always
telling the guys where to go and pick up

273
00:17:32,501 --> 00:17:34,400
stuff.
You're 10 years older than man,

274
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:37,810
I don't does these references a lot of
times I don't get, well, it's classic.

275
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:42,640
Have you ever seen the Maltese Falcon
in college? But I don't remember it. Oh,

276
00:17:42,641 --> 00:17:46,210
you don't? Oh, that's right. What's
your plan? What is my point? Oop.

277
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:49,350
I like how aggressive you're going into
this. This is very offensive. I like it.

278
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:53,040
But you just said to me, you're
trashing me, so why wouldn't I be I,

279
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:56,280
I wasn't saying that it was wrong.
What was your point?

280
00:17:56,460 --> 00:18:00,660
Is it me or is there a lot of tension
for a holiday? Yes. Yes, there is.

281
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:05,160
I was just saying that I'm going to start
when I go out and about when I drive

282
00:18:05,161 --> 00:18:07,110
around Hollywood,
checking out the scene,

283
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,250
I'm going to start shutting off my phone.

284
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,033
Okay.

285
00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:16,960
Because you're always giving me jobs.
Ah.

286
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:22,410
Do you notice when you go out, I don't
call you up and be like, Hey Nia,

287
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:26,460
can you go by the two page
shop and pick up my, my rug?

288
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:28,850
[inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible]

289
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:34,830
yeah. I mean, it's a real, that's a
real hard time for you. I understand.

290
00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:36,850
It's difficult for you.
I get it.

291
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:42,330
Kind of just going to go with arrogance.
So beyond your capabilities.

292
00:18:42,331 --> 00:18:47,100
So that's cool. I'll manage
my expectations. Thank you.
Thank you. Can you do that?

293
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:52,950
Can you stop giving me assignments?
It's really hot in here. Is it just me?

294
00:18:52,951 --> 00:18:57,520
Is it really? It's really hot in
here. So take off your bath robe.

295
00:18:58,410 --> 00:19:02,750
Um, come on, stop it. Be
Fun on the podcast. Okay.

296
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:05,730
Just cause I went in there and I trashed
you right out of the gate rather than

297
00:19:05,731 --> 00:19:10,350
being thankful. Oh my God. Oh my God. Hey,

298
00:19:10,351 --> 00:19:13,890
did you, um, where were you giving me
shit for coming in so late last night.

299
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:18,750
Cause I was wondering where that after
you were. I was upstairs first of all.

300
00:19:18,810 --> 00:19:19,980
Okay.
Okay.

301
00:19:19,981 --> 00:19:24,981
Mom and I went to turn on the
fucking TV to watch the Bruins first.

302
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:29,310
The New Jersey devils and the fast forward
button worked and then I couldn't get

303
00:19:29,311 --> 00:19:34,140
it to stop you. Always
worse. It was on one. Oh No.

304
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:35,340
I was actually trying to watch it

305
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:41,100
and I realized it needed to do batteries.
First.

306
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:44,730
World problems. Right. All right.

307
00:19:44,731 --> 00:19:49,290
So tell me what happened with your
Thanksgiving dinner. Oh Wow. You know,

308
00:19:49,291 --> 00:19:54,060
I don't like to trash people in the
podcast, but I will say that this,

309
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:56,400
you know,
particular company that I ordered from,

310
00:19:56,430 --> 00:19:59,850
they promised you a peach cobbler and
you got there and it wasn't there. Well,

311
00:19:59,851 --> 00:20:04,500
you know,
and so I made it known via a very short,

312
00:20:04,501 --> 00:20:09,300
simple email that I was disappointed
in that fact. And you know,

313
00:20:09,301 --> 00:20:12,200
I was waiting two and a half
hours to pick it up and you know,

314
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:14,550
nobody could have nobody came
out and said, hey, listen,

315
00:20:14,551 --> 00:20:16,740
doesn't look like the peach
cobblers happening. I'm so sorry.

316
00:20:16,741 --> 00:20:18,420
Because then I would've been like,
okay,

317
00:20:18,421 --> 00:20:22,350
well let me maybe run out and try
to grab something. But you know,

318
00:20:22,351 --> 00:20:26,010
I waited for two and a half hours in
the parking lot and got my food and came

319
00:20:26,011 --> 00:20:26,940
home.
I was exhausted.

320
00:20:26,941 --> 00:20:29,850
And now you're going to write those people
back as they responded to your email

321
00:20:29,851 --> 00:20:33,600
with like a four page Gettysburg address.
I'm telling you,

322
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:34,501
she write him back and be like,

323
00:20:34,501 --> 00:20:39,090
if you spend as much time making my
peach cobbler rather than giving me four

324
00:20:39,091 --> 00:20:41,700
pages of excuses where you're the victim,

325
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,430
here's a good one for your
business in the future.

326
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:47,920
Don't promise what you can't deliver.
That's pretty much

327
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:52,240
what I, yeah, yeah. They said you ordered
really late then don't take the order.

328
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:57,100
Yeah, they should've said no. All right.
Um, hey, but they were doing me a favor.

329
00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:01,870
Is is basically the tone that I got back
was that they were doing me a favor and

330
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:06,490
you know, um, it was difficult
to get my payments information,

331
00:21:06,730 --> 00:21:09,850
but it's like I missed a couple phone
calls cause I was with the baby.

332
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:12,700
So now you have excuses.
Yes.

333
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:17,560
But then when the [inaudible]
pod here on a third time,

334
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:19,870
I gave them the information
and for the full amount,

335
00:21:19,871 --> 00:21:22,480
not the half deposit that
they initially requested,

336
00:21:22,481 --> 00:21:26,020
I was like go ahead and do the
full amount, but you know, um,

337
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:28,420
do you guys think that,
will there be a second date?

338
00:21:28,421 --> 00:21:31,850
Do you guys think you're ever going
to, this is the second date. Recall.

339
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:35,290
So this is this, there will
not be a third date. You know,

340
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:38,980
life goes on and uh,
yeah,

341
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:42,310
but one thing is your own fucking
meal. I'm telling you, I see that.

342
00:21:43,370 --> 00:21:47,110
So I have to deal with other people's
bullshit. You know, it's, it's,

343
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:47,921
it's fine though.

344
00:21:47,921 --> 00:21:51,430
It's like I expected this response back
because I have dealt with this person

345
00:21:51,431 --> 00:21:53,800
before. So, you know,

346
00:21:53,801 --> 00:21:58,801
this isn't surprising that it would be
like a whole list of reasons of excuses,

347
00:21:59,021 --> 00:22:01,050
I should say.
Not even reasons it's excused.

348
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:03,970
I love how she kept complimenting
you and telling you to have a happy

349
00:22:03,971 --> 00:22:05,410
thanksgiving. Oh, all in Cadillac.

350
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:10,490
Just the air getting on an airplane and
we're jetting away to enjoy or the anger

351
00:22:12,430 --> 00:22:16,790
as opposed to being like, I know you're
disappointed. Sorry about that. Sorry.

352
00:22:16,810 --> 00:22:20,590
We promise something that we couldn't
deliver, but here's four pages of excuses.

353
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:24,340
Yeah. Here's a bunch of excuses
why. And then to like, you know,

354
00:22:24,341 --> 00:22:28,360
bring my mother into it as well,
which is very classy. Very,

355
00:22:28,361 --> 00:22:32,260
very classy on, on this person's part.
But you know, I feel like Andy Cohen,

356
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:33,100
right nose.

357
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:36,580
Like I wish the other person who didn't
make the sweet potato pie was here.

358
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:42,730
Sweet Potato Pie guy.
I don't, I'll come on.

359
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:48,910
So Nia, um, I have to, what? Have you
started Christmas shopping yet? No,

360
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:53,740
I have, I am fucking crushing
it. Nieces, nephews done. Okay.

361
00:22:54,190 --> 00:22:58,690
You done what's I'm done with you.
I'm breaking up with, you know,

362
00:22:58,691 --> 00:23:00,700
Christmas gift for you. No, I'm actually,

363
00:23:00,701 --> 00:23:05,370
I'm going to wrap some shit and then
I'm going to wrap my presence. Sorry,

364
00:23:06,310 --> 00:23:07,500
I'll look.
Can read a little bit.

365
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:11,170
Did you see the Christmas wrapping
paper that I got for you? For the kids?

366
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:15,210
Oh yeah. I thought it was cute. Like
peanuts and then like Rudolph or Mickey,

367
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,320
your gifts are also going
to be wrapped in that.

368
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:24,000
We have other wrapping paper. All right,
let me read this thing here. Yeah.

369
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:28,360
This frigging shied feel so much
better today after not moving.

370
00:23:28,361 --> 00:23:33,220
I think the key, the key to letting your
rib cage heal is to not move. Right?

371
00:23:33,221 --> 00:23:36,850
So I want to let you know today,
I'm not avoiding you and your relatives.

372
00:23:37,430 --> 00:23:39,820
You're just not. I'm
nursing my side. Okay.

373
00:23:39,970 --> 00:23:44,290
Are you just going to be able to handle
this sober? Me On the holidays. I mean,

374
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:46,070
having,
I've been it for the last

375
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:48,080
however long. You haven't
been drinking? No,

376
00:23:48,081 --> 00:23:50,410
but on the holidays usually
get all drunk and belligerent.

377
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:54,220
Start telling everybody around the
room with their problems. It's anytime

378
00:23:55,850 --> 00:23:56,780
I'm a happy drunk.

379
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:00,860
I like to think so silly and
goofy and you're very loving.

380
00:24:00,890 --> 00:24:03,700
You're one of those drunks that calls
me up at four in the morning and telling

381
00:24:03,701 --> 00:24:08,120
me how much you love me.
I do. That's so funny.

382
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:13,010
Yeah. That's why I don't need
weed, man. I don't need the we,

383
00:24:13,011 --> 00:24:16,850
I'm done with that shit. You
say that all the time. Yeah,

384
00:24:16,851 --> 00:24:20,570
but I don't smoke that much.
[inaudible] so every time I do,

385
00:24:20,571 --> 00:24:23,510
I just always fucking burns my throat.
I don't get it.

386
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:29,300
I just don't know how to control your
inhale. Yeah. And I just don't get it.

387
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:33,920
You're just doing like these bong
rip type of things and like do shots.

388
00:24:33,921 --> 00:24:36,350
What do you want? Because you're
trying to get that same effect.

389
00:24:36,351 --> 00:24:37,730
It doesn't work like that.
You know,

390
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:42,500
I'm not just trying to fucking
inhale and fill it out. I don't know.

391
00:24:42,950 --> 00:24:45,440
Yeah. I don't want to get good at
it. I don't want to get good at,

392
00:24:45,441 --> 00:24:48,770
but whenever I don't drink then I'll
every once in a while I'll come around and

393
00:24:48,771 --> 00:24:50,360
be all right. I got to,
I got to do something.

394
00:24:50,450 --> 00:24:51,830
I've got to break up the monotony here.

395
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:56,030
Thank God you're not into heroin
or I'd be doing that. The heroin,

396
00:24:56,300 --> 00:25:00,360
I made a sweet potato pie. I feel like
I'm down. I feel like I'm woke. Um,

397
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:02,720
all right.
Frame bridge everybody.

398
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:06,530
If you've previously
listened to this show,

399
00:25:06,531 --> 00:25:08,360
you've heard me talk about frame bridge,

400
00:25:08,930 --> 00:25:13,930
they make it super easy and affordable
to co two custom frame favorite things

401
00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:17,690
from art prints and posters
to the photos on your phone.

402
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:22,100
I actually collected all the pictures
of our lovely daughter and put it on a

403
00:25:22,101 --> 00:25:25,040
hard drive and there was so many of
them that I was like, you know what?

404
00:25:25,610 --> 00:25:29,060
I think frame bridge could really help
me out with this one. There you go.

405
00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:30,103
That's a personal story.

406
00:25:30,290 --> 00:25:35,290
Men's health says frame
bridge has disrupted the
custom framing industry making

407
00:25:37,850 --> 00:25:41,150
what has typically been a
frustrating and expensive process.

408
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:46,030
Easy and affordable shots
fired in the customer.

409
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:48,000
Big Frame. Yeah. Take that. Yeah.

410
00:25:48,050 --> 00:25:51,410
Custom framers and with the
holiday around the quarter frame,

411
00:25:51,411 --> 00:25:55,850
bridge is the perfect way to send truly
one of a kind gifts without that much

412
00:25:55,851 --> 00:26:00,800
thought out. Right to everyone on your
list. This perfect. This is what you need.

413
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:03,650
The thing about it is there's so
many people that you don't like,

414
00:26:03,651 --> 00:26:08,390
but you have to get him something right.
You know what I mean? That's perfect.

415
00:26:08,391 --> 00:26:12,050
You don't have the fucking time. Just
scroll through your Goddamn cell phone.

416
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:15,680
Go past the Dick Pics. Go past that, that,

417
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:18,350
that picture of the directions.
Okay.

418
00:26:18,351 --> 00:26:20,300
That you have saved on
there for whatever reason,

419
00:26:20,301 --> 00:26:24,680
and find that picture of you in this
person you just required to get a stocking

420
00:26:24,681 --> 00:26:29,681
stuffer for right and go in there and
just send it up and then it's done and

421
00:26:31,071 --> 00:26:33,550
then it's done. There you
go. There you go. What's the,

422
00:26:33,551 --> 00:26:34,760
where did you go during all of that?

423
00:26:34,790 --> 00:26:39,070
You just fucking started staring a hole
through my giant head here. Sorry, I'm no,

424
00:26:39,170 --> 00:26:41,870
I'm, what do you think you're
thinking about the meal,
right? You're a little off.

425
00:26:41,930 --> 00:26:44,130
You're a little off on this
podcast. Sorry. I'm, yeah,

426
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:47,430
because I'm trying to figure out if I'm
going to respond to this email or not.

427
00:26:47,431 --> 00:26:51,330
I don't think I'm going
to, oh, I would have to,

428
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:53,010
I would just real quickly I would just be,

429
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:56,670
I would just pay something along them
going back and forth and back and forth

430
00:26:56,671 --> 00:27:01,290
about it. You know what I mean? Like
it's just going to be more of the same,

431
00:27:01,770 --> 00:27:04,860
you know?
I said what I had to say and I was,

432
00:27:04,861 --> 00:27:07,210
that they said would be right to say.
And you know,

433
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:11,040
you guys both said what you had to say.
Anything she's supposed to be thankful

434
00:27:12,670 --> 00:27:17,280
that you, yeah. You know why I'm doing
this and highly favored, you know,

435
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:19,280
like the letters.
Do you want to keep doing this?

436
00:27:19,310 --> 00:27:22,640
What I'm thankful for is I fucking hate.

437
00:27:22,910 --> 00:27:25,640
That's the one thing about
Thanksgiving that I cannot stand.

438
00:27:25,670 --> 00:27:27,530
What is listening to adults

439
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:33,400
toothbrush, like just eat.
Don't think that's nice.

440
00:27:33,430 --> 00:27:38,430
I don't like listening to it because
I am so jaded that I'm just like,

441
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:44,720
I just feel like people try to top one
another about like what they're thankful

442
00:27:44,721 --> 00:27:48,920
for and how much more they understand
what's really makes you happy in life.

443
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:50,810
Yeah.
Um,

444
00:27:51,110 --> 00:27:54,710
it's like when people have a baby and
they tried to sit there and talk about

445
00:27:54,711 --> 00:27:58,190
like how much they love their babies,
so then they have to top the other person.

446
00:27:58,850 --> 00:28:02,840
Oh my God, my heart is just filled
to the brim with love. Oh yeah.

447
00:28:02,990 --> 00:28:06,440
I feel like my heart is on the outside
of my body now and then they just keep

448
00:28:06,441 --> 00:28:10,220
fucking going about their heart
and she's like to, to begin it.

449
00:28:10,221 --> 00:28:13,190
You love your kids. You love your
kid. Yes. I get it. Oh my God.

450
00:28:13,191 --> 00:28:17,000
Is it standing up like all babies
eventually do. That is incredible.

451
00:28:19,090 --> 00:28:22,840
Actually. Some babies can't and that's
where we need to be thankful for.

452
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:25,970
That's right. All right. Just go
to frame bridge dot. Yeah. Calm.

453
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:33,590
Oh, blowed your photo from your computer
or directly from your Instagram feed.

454
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:37,160
Fucking ribs being messed up.
You can't sneeze and you can't laugh.

455
00:28:37,190 --> 00:28:41,640
I mean that is basically, that's
my wheelhouse of emotion. I live,

456
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:46,230
I live between laughing and sneezing.
I'm going to be robotic today.

457
00:28:46,510 --> 00:28:50,430
Do you we have ribs for as a,
as part of our uh, entrepreneur.

458
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:53,730
I hope he didn't get into the
peach cobbler fight before
they made those goddamn

459
00:28:53,731 --> 00:28:57,460
things. No, I waited. So you
know, I just pictured him,

460
00:28:58,660 --> 00:29:02,760
pictured him taking the ribs and running
itall right along the crack of his ass.

461
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:06,420
Now as you glaze for your
mother, fuck. Alright.

462
00:29:06,421 --> 00:29:09,540
I don't think he would ever do that.
He is actually very classy I think.

00:29:27,230 --> 00:29:30,500
you just take a selfie if you scowling
at them and then get it framed.

Yeah. And have a tee shirt on that

a lot of fun with these. The best part,

476

at $39 in all shipping is free.

478
00:30:08,561 --> 00:30:10,570
The best part is this
copy's going to keep going,

479

gets the concept frame.

go back to cooking our own
meal, right? Oh, absolutely.

487
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:38,200
This is just because we got
the little one this year.

488
00:30:38,650 --> 00:30:42,640
I feel like I'm all over as I got a
little overwhelming. So, you know,

489
00:30:42,670 --> 00:30:43,930
I thought I kinda like,

490
00:30:43,931 --> 00:30:46,390
you have ever cheat on a test and then
you get it back and you have kind of that

491
00:30:46,391 --> 00:30:51,250
feeling of guilt. Yeah. I never
did. Uh, me undies. Everybody.

492
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:54,790
Ah, but do, do, do beyond
these, beyond these,

493
00:30:54,791 --> 00:30:58,810
where's my fucking pie?
Did you do to me and eat me undies?

494
00:30:58,811 --> 00:31:00,700
Make it as someone's got to die.

495
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:05,110
I don't give a fuck about all your
excuses. Make the fucking thing.

496
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:10,390
Put it in the Khumbu, sir. And I'm
going to drive away nice and happy.

497
00:31:10,450 --> 00:31:14,020
I guess we don't get to is there it
you fucking cunts. They're all right.

498
00:31:14,050 --> 00:31:18,430
Every year millions of people receive
the least liked gift of all time

499
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:23,320
underwear. But I like, you know what's
funny is buying your wife sexy underwear.

500
00:31:23,321 --> 00:31:27,340
I mean, is that really a gift?
Hey, put this on, dress it up.

501
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:33,310
Yeah. Who Does the flower? You
like lingerie? You like lingerie?

502
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:37,620
I love lingerie. You just liked the
word, makes you feel bilingual. Um,

503
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:38,980
lingerie on,

504
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:43,000
but we still give it to try it because
we still give it to our family.

505
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:47,950
That's what you do. You take a picture
of underwear, you get it framed,

506
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:52,740
and then you send it to
somebody. And that's two for
one. That's weird, isn't it?

507
00:31:52,930 --> 00:31:57,220
Sounds like some weird like Jeffrey
Dahmer Shit. It's just the underwear.

508
00:31:57,221 --> 00:31:58,990
I'm not saying you're in it with a stiffy,

509
00:31:59,650 --> 00:32:03,370
but we still give it to our families and
our loved ones who just don't want it.

510
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:08,950
Uh, but maybe it's not, I
couldn't even just chuckle there,

511
00:32:09,250 --> 00:32:12,220
but it's not that underwear to go.
Ha ha ha.

512
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:20,770
Oh, that wasn't a bad one. But maybe no,

513
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:23,500
because what happens is the muscle
spasms and they just fucking,

514
00:32:23,501 --> 00:32:28,090
they start locking up. Okay. You know,
it's funny, he's trying to sneeze,

515
00:32:28,091 --> 00:32:28,924
relaxed,

516
00:32:29,830 --> 00:32:32,890
but I tried to do was just exhale as much
air out as I can and then you just go,

517
00:32:33,570 --> 00:32:37,720
whew. He sneezed and it doesn't
get out. And then it just, yeah,

518
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:40,910
you need that Guy Barnes platoon
in your face going take the,

519
00:32:41,690 --> 00:32:46,370
but maybe it's not that an underwear is
the problem. It's the kind of underwear.

520
00:32:47,150 --> 00:32:50,240
Let, Oh, let, let me
tell you about me undies.

521
00:32:50,270 --> 00:32:55,040
The only underwear that makes for
an amazing gift, soft, flexible,

522
00:32:55,041 --> 00:32:59,300
like the whore up the street waistband
three times softer than cotton.

523
00:32:59,930 --> 00:33:04,250
Naturally sustainable sourced fiber.
Mandy's maid underwear.

524
00:33:04,251 --> 00:33:06,830
The perfect gift that
everyone is going to love.

525
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:10,730
He's going to love you for you know it's
funny. Did they break up with modal,

526
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:12,920
modal, cause they don't talk
about the fabric anymore.

527
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:16,760
Can they send me some underwear?
Underwear. Can I have some to there?

528
00:33:16,761 --> 00:33:20,420
I don't want you walking around and
guys underwear. Oh wait a minute.

529
00:33:20,421 --> 00:33:23,030
They also make them for the lady.

530
00:33:23,990 --> 00:33:27,670
It's a Goddamn holiday miracle this year.
Don't give it, don't give underwear it.

531
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:28,670

Jesus Christ lift Nia. Can I come back?

537
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:54,290
Oh absolutely. I'll turn down
the volume I have to change.

538
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:57,830
Change into what did you buy?
Electric Turkey dress.

539
00:33:59,930 --> 00:34:04,660
Do you have the little underneath
your chin? Peach Cobbler. That was,

540
00:34:05,090 --> 00:34:09,530
that sounds like a wrestler.
Oh, maybe that'll be my
wrestling name. Peach Cobbler.

541
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:13,280
Peach Cobbler. I like it. I was
going to go as the millennial.

542
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:15,230
I just think it's a great
wrestling character.

543
00:34:15,231 --> 00:34:18,980
You just get offended by everything
and then you go when you do some self

544
00:34:18,981 --> 00:34:23,540
righteous con. Yeah. I'm going to be
peach cobbler. I like it. Okay. Okay.

545
00:34:24,370 --> 00:34:27,770
There she goes. Everybody. All right.
I wonder if I use two microphones.

546
00:34:27,771 --> 00:34:32,210
Will I be half is funny or twice as
funny? All right, lift everybody.

547
00:34:32,660 --> 00:34:37,660
Lyft knows that drivers are what keeps
them moving so they do everything they

548
00:34:37,941 --> 00:34:41,030
can to make sure their drivers
are happy on every trip.

549
00:34:43,590 --> 00:34:44,330
Oh,

550
00:34:44,330 --> 00:34:47,960
lift believes that being a ride
sharing drivers should be fun.

551
00:34:49,410 --> 00:34:52,140
Oh, don't have too much fun. You
fucking drive in the car. Ramen.

552
00:34:52,810 --> 00:34:55,940
That's like when you fly one of these
stupid airlines and the stewardesses as a

553
00:34:55,941 --> 00:34:58,700
singing songs like on southwest,
it's like,

554
00:34:58,790 --> 00:35:01,970
will you shut the fuck up and
try to be remotely professional?

555
00:35:02,210 --> 00:35:05,980
My life is in your hands.
You know,

556
00:35:06,010 --> 00:35:11,010
I hate more is the people that laugh and
applaud and just egg them on every got

557
00:35:11,031 --> 00:35:15,760
a free show. I don't even know why we
have to get off the plate in Vegas. Uh,

558
00:35:16,130 --> 00:35:19,850
lift believes that being a ride sharing
drivers should be fun if you have a good

559
00:35:19,851 --> 00:35:23,050
time. So are the passengers. Um,

560
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:25,700
if you're choosing a Rogers
picturing everybody boozing it up,

561
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:27,170
we're having a great time,
right?

562
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:30,850
You're not going to be okay.
I said a God damn fucking Barts.

563
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:35,370
If you're choosing a ride sharing company
to drive for a go with the company

564
00:35:35,371 --> 00:35:40,050
that treats you better. Lyft, Lyft
was the first to offer in APP tipping.

565
00:35:40,051 --> 00:35:43,320
When you drive for Lyft,
you get 100% of the tips.

566
00:35:43,321 --> 00:35:48,090
Drivers have been paid over 200 million
in tips since the feature was introduced.

567
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:53,610
Lyft has taken the guesswork out
of pickups. The new amp device,

568
00:35:53,670 --> 00:35:58,290
is it supposed to be app amp device
uses color coding to help passages find

569
00:35:58,291 --> 00:35:59,820
their drivers and lets
the light in the car.

570
00:36:00,150 --> 00:36:03,030
You couldn't earn hundreds of
dollars a week plus tips. One,

571
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:07,620
earned money drive more. You want to
earn more money. Everybody worked more.

572
00:36:07,770 --> 00:36:10,230
It's never been easier
to give yourself a raise.

573
00:36:10,530 --> 00:36:14,570
It's a simple formula that's
not a res, uh, raises.

574
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:19,500
You make more an hour. A raise is not
you work more. Jesus fucking Christ.

575
00:36:19,501 --> 00:36:23,550
I suck at math that even I saw through
that bullshit. It's a simple formula.

576
00:36:23,551 --> 00:36:26,490
Happy drivers mean happy passengers make.

577
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:31,440
Maybe that's why nine out of 10 Lyft rides
get a perfect five star rating. Yeah,

578
00:36:31,441 --> 00:36:36,030
and one out of 10 are good at math. Uh, s
of Jesus built. Don't burn this one down.

579
00:36:36,031 --> 00:36:39,270
I love Lyft. I love Lyft.
Do you know what I mean?

580
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:44,220
Less people die from drinking and
driving because of Lyft. I love Lyft.

581
00:36:45,210 --> 00:36:47,100
I love lamp.
I love Lyft.

582
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:51,270

believes in treating its people betters.

we in the podcast? Oh 38 minutes.

610
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:52,270
Are you guys thankful for the extra
eight minutes that I gave you?

611
00:38:54,010 --> 00:38:57,520
Um, so I got my Christmas shopping
started. I'm very excited about that.

612
00:38:57,521 --> 00:39:00,100
I think I'm actually going to do
a family Christmas card this year.

613
00:39:00,130 --> 00:39:04,630
Every year we were like, we should do
that and we never did it well this year.

614
00:39:04,631 --> 00:39:07,450
God dammit we're going to do it
cause we got a kid now. Right?

615
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:12,730
If you don't have a fucking kid, you know,
past a certain age is, if it's just you,

616
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:16,210
you, your significant other
other than your family pet,

617
00:39:16,211 --> 00:39:18,970
don't you start feeling like
the other people judging you?

618
00:39:20,410 --> 00:39:22,810
They haven't reproduced. What's
wrong with them? I don't know.

619
00:39:22,811 --> 00:39:27,580
Maybe they're informed. They understand
how much you know, population.

620
00:39:27,581 --> 00:39:31,330
Let's not get into the population problem.
Hey, hey, fair enough. Fair enough.

621
00:39:31,570 --> 00:39:35,470
Speaking of, fair enough, the
throwback podcast for you,

622
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:39,010
for those of you who are new to my
podcast and you're listening for the first

623
00:39:39,011 --> 00:39:42,010
time,
which I am so thankful for,

624
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:47,710
I just feel it for me. If
I have for listeners, um,

625
00:39:49,750 --> 00:39:50,350
Andrew,

626
00:39:50,350 --> 00:39:55,000
who I am also thankful for the wonderful
producer who picks out the music every

627
00:39:55,001 --> 00:39:58,420
week. When we do the, the, uh,
after I, I babbled for a half hour,

628
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:01,030
we then had listened to some music,
a little interlude,

629
00:40:01,031 --> 00:40:05,890
and then we go into a classic podcast
from a Thursday going by and another year

630
00:40:05,891 --> 00:40:08,830
or possibly earlier this year.
Evidently last year,

631
00:40:08,831 --> 00:40:13,570
one of these years I gave
the, uh, the now classic.

632
00:40:13,690 --> 00:40:17,620
I like to call it a classic
because I would like to do
something classic in life.

633
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:20,630
So I'm going to say that what I did
was classic, uh, the fair enough,

634
00:40:21,670 --> 00:40:25,360
like how to get through your Thanksgiving
dinner with the simple phrase.

635
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,940
Fair enough,
Huh?

636
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:33,100
You don't feel that a
boarding a child is murder.

637
00:40:33,550 --> 00:40:37,780
Fair enough. It is. You
killed something. Right?

638
00:40:38,050 --> 00:40:41,680
Cause if you didn't do it, I mean they're
dead based something. Fair enough.

639
00:40:42,850 --> 00:40:46,090
I like doing that. I like arguing
the opposite side of political shit.

640
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:48,040
Like if I was in a conservative,

641
00:40:49,090 --> 00:40:53,890
conservative fucking state,
I would argue pro pro choice.

642
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:55,960
When I'm in La,

643
00:40:56,110 --> 00:41:00,520
I argue pro life and none of it,

644
00:41:00,550 --> 00:41:03,370
none of it has to do with the
fetus or anything like that.

645
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:08,400
All it has to do with is me annoying
the person that I'm talking to him.

646
00:41:10,150 --> 00:41:12,940
That's what I do. Anyways, that's,
that's the Thursday afternoon,

647
00:41:12,941 --> 00:41:16,360
just before Friday. Monday morning
podcast. God bless all of you.

648
00:41:17,110 --> 00:41:18,670
I am so thankful.

649
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:23,830
I'm so thankful to be able to go out and
tell jokes every night and I just feel

650
00:41:23,831 --> 00:41:26,920
like for me,
all right,

651
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:32,080
have a great thanksgiving weekend you
cunt and I will talk to you on Monday.

652
00:41:32,530 --> 00:41:34,130
I cannot to watch the football

653
00:41:34,130 --> 00:41:37,940
game, but unfortunately my wife has gone
into that fucking Westminster dog show,

654
00:41:37,941 --> 00:41:41,450
which I really enjoy except for the fact
that it comes on at the same time as

655
00:41:41,451 --> 00:41:43,160
the football game there.
I said it by

656
00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:00,253
[inaudible]

657
00:42:29,870 --> 00:42:30,703
[inaudible]

658
00:42:31,130 --> 00:42:34,970
the Turkey day to you. Oh, you know,

659
00:42:34,971 --> 00:42:38,870
stuffing and potatoes and pie and beer.

660
00:42:39,950 --> 00:42:44,950
Cranberries in gravy and
your cousin who's gay.

661
00:42:46,370 --> 00:42:50,870
Um, hey, what's going on? How
are you? Happy thanksgiving.

662
00:42:51,020 --> 00:42:54,680
Happy not having to fucking
go to work today. Huh?

663
00:42:55,790 --> 00:42:58,700
You around the table. Are
you sitting down yet? Well,

664
00:42:58,701 --> 00:43:01,310
if you haven't gone downstairs yet,
I got, I got some advice for you.

665
00:43:01,311 --> 00:43:05,270
Today is going to be a day. I think it's
going to be a lot of fucking arguments.

666
00:43:06,470 --> 00:43:09,920
A lot of fucking arguments at the
table, right? The big fucking election.

667
00:43:09,921 --> 00:43:12,260
Some people wanted the
guy with the eyebrows.

668
00:43:12,620 --> 00:43:17,620
Some people wanted the fucking
lady with the pants suit.

669
00:43:18,380 --> 00:43:22,310
Right? Um, this is what you gotta do.

670
00:43:22,311 --> 00:43:24,110
So you're already gonna have a fight,
right?

671
00:43:24,111 --> 00:43:27,710
There's already going to be your older
brother. There's going to be this person.

672
00:43:28,150 --> 00:43:31,100
There's going to be another
person, somebody who's going
to say something, right?

673
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:33,830
And you're going to be begging to have
a couple of wild fucking turkeys as you

674
00:43:33,831 --> 00:43:37,630
standing over there. You know,
eating a fucking appetizer or two.

675
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:39,710
Somebody's going to be
getting on your nerves.

676
00:43:39,711 --> 00:43:44,360
Maybe somebody fucking wife who
won't shut the fuck up, right?

677
00:43:44,870 --> 00:43:49,790
Why the fuck did he marry her? Maybe.
Maybe it's the husband, Jesus Christ.

678
00:43:49,791 --> 00:43:52,760
What is she doing with this guy?
All he does is fucking talk about himself.

679
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:56,480
Something's going to drive you up
the fucking wall. If it's not this,

680
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:58,940
it's going to be that this is,
this is the phrase,

681
00:44:00,020 --> 00:44:03,320
this is a phrase that's going to save your
day. Okay? Save the whole fucking day.

682
00:44:03,470 --> 00:44:06,260
Cause you're not going to change anybody's
opinion. Oh, these fucking jerk off.

683
00:44:06,261 --> 00:44:09,080
Still yelling. He hung blue.
Could you vote for Trump? Well,

684
00:44:09,081 --> 00:44:11,030
what the Fuck About Hillary?
You're not changing.

685
00:44:11,031 --> 00:44:12,530
You're just gonna fucking
yell at each other.

686
00:44:12,531 --> 00:44:15,560
So here's the phrase you've got to
use to get through this fucking day.

687
00:44:16,100 --> 00:44:19,280
All right? Along with the alcohol or
whatever drug you fucking want to use,

688
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:24,680
fair enough. You know, hey, fair enough.

689
00:44:26,190 --> 00:44:30,930
It's like, that's all you gotta do. What'd
you say? Hey, hey guys, guys, guys, fair,

690
00:44:31,860 --> 00:44:36,300
fair enough. Whatever. You don't
need to see him anymore right now,

691
00:44:36,301 --> 00:44:39,000
if you're younger and you still live
there, that's kind of fucking tough.

692
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:41,910
I don't know what to tell you, but if
you've already moved out of the house,

693
00:44:41,911 --> 00:44:43,770
why are you still arguing
with these people?

694
00:44:44,310 --> 00:44:46,980
Why are you still trying to
change their fucking minds?

695
00:44:47,310 --> 00:44:50,430
You're not can change their minds.
All right? I don't give a fuck.

696
00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:54,990
If you majored in debating, it's just
stupid fucking school in the woods.

697
00:44:55,170 --> 00:44:57,330
Whatever the fuck it is.
You did that.

698
00:44:57,331 --> 00:45:01,290
Now you're coming back and now you think
you know something and you think that

699
00:45:01,291 --> 00:45:05,190
you fucking siblings want to hear it.
You know what? They don't the same way.

700
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:07,730
You don't want to hear the way
they fucking eat. When they had,

701
00:45:07,780 --> 00:45:10,070
they've had a couple, two, three,
right? And all of a sudden the man,

702
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:14,100
everything just sounds like they're
eating fucking mashed potatoes. You know,

703
00:45:14,101 --> 00:45:17,730
you start hammering these murderers
fucking thoughts, you know?

704
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:21,980
Just fair enough. Hey, fair
enough. Whenever, whenever.

705
00:45:22,100 --> 00:45:24,850
Was that what you think is that? Is
that how you look at the world? Hey,

706
00:45:24,851 --> 00:45:29,850
God bless you. Pass the fucking
peas and carrots. Fair enough.

707
00:45:30,630 --> 00:45:31,650
Fair enough.
You know,

708
00:45:32,580 --> 00:45:36,840
and that's all you've got to do that
eventually the meal's going to be over.

709
00:45:37,350 --> 00:45:37,950
All right?

710
00:45:37,950 --> 00:45:40,500
And you're going to get in your fucking
car and you're going to drive away

711
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:45,240
unless you stay in there for the weekend.
Well then you've got to go out to,

712
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:48,390
I don't know, you've got
Uber. You gotta write,

713
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:53,070
you gotta get the fuck out of
there. Yeah. Thanksgiving is a, uh,

714
00:45:53,310 --> 00:45:56,930
it's such a great day. There is no
pressure to get any gifts eaten,

715
00:45:56,960 --> 00:46:01,470
a bunch of great food. All of
that is tremendous. Okay. Unless,

716
00:46:02,430 --> 00:46:05,640
unless you go into her fucking
family's house or his family's house,

717
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:07,800
that's a weird one because you know,

718
00:46:07,801 --> 00:46:10,740
you're used to all your
family's food and thanksgiving.

719
00:46:10,741 --> 00:46:13,140
You know how it's supposed to taste it.
You're going to go somewhere else.

720
00:46:13,141 --> 00:46:16,020
It's going to taste a little
bit different. You know,

721
00:46:16,590 --> 00:46:20,250
this is like a classic standup bit,
like here's how it usually is,

722
00:46:20,251 --> 00:46:24,210
but when you're fucking blah, blah,
blah, it's a whole different story,

723
00:46:25,110 --> 00:46:29,220
right? And you just got to suck
it up and just be like, you know,

724
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:34,740
worst case scenario, this
absolutely fucking sucks, you know,

725
00:46:35,340 --> 00:46:38,250
in which case, fair enough. You know,
you don't know how to cook. Okay,

726
00:46:38,251 --> 00:46:40,960
you're supposed to cook
today. You know, it's,

727
00:46:40,961 --> 00:46:45,300
it's like when it's somebody's birthday,
most people can't sing,

728
00:46:45,301 --> 00:46:48,510
but God dammit, you got to sing the
song. So they do the best they can.

729
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:52,590
Happy Birthday, right? They
do what the fuck they can.

730
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:56,170
Well, sometimes you got to take the, the,

731
00:46:56,180 --> 00:47:01,180
the same fucking theory of a tone deaf
person singing happy birthday to you

732
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:06,270
because they love you, right? You
get, you got to apply that to food,

733
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:08,640
which is a motherfucker,

734
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:12,720
which brings it to how do I make it
look like I ate the shit when I really

735
00:47:12,721 --> 00:47:17,010
didn't? Well, oh Jesus.

736
00:47:17,011 --> 00:47:20,770
I don't know how to do this one. Once
you got to do is you got to fucking, uh,

737
00:47:21,030 --> 00:47:25,350
eager to engage in a lot of conversation
as you just sort of fucking hitting the

738
00:47:25,351 --> 00:47:28,950
plate with your fork a little
bit is if you almost like,

739
00:47:28,990 --> 00:47:31,810
you know that noise people make when
they want someone to make a speech,

740
00:47:31,811 --> 00:47:35,680
that annoying fucking
thing, you know? Oh my God,

741
00:47:35,681 --> 00:47:38,140
nothing fucking makes
my goddamn blood boil.

742
00:47:38,170 --> 00:47:41,950
Like when I'm in the middle of a fucking
conversation at some con starts hitting

743
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:45,760
the glass with the fork and then for
whatever social fucking reason I have to

744
00:47:45,761 --> 00:47:50,470
now shut up, you know? Oh
my God, that gets me gone.

745
00:47:50,471 --> 00:47:54,630
But not today. Not Today. Everybody.
Hey, fair enough. Hey, someone's downs.

746
00:47:55,150 --> 00:47:57,730
Somebody down the fucking street over
there with a little little fucking scone

747
00:47:58,140 --> 00:48:01,640
knocking against some glass.
You know,

748
00:48:01,820 --> 00:48:06,470
I guess we all have to stop as adults.
We have to shut the fuck up, right?

749
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:07,620
Yeah.

750
00:48:07,620 --> 00:48:10,860
Like we're working for this asshole
bay. You know what? Hey, fair enough.

751
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:16,320
Fair enough. You know, he
just fucking sit there. Oh,

752
00:48:16,321 --> 00:48:20,490
here we go. Oh good. Oh, here's a cliched
what? I'm thankful for speech. Oh,

753
00:48:20,491 --> 00:48:23,220
is that what you're thankful for?
I'm thankful for lady.

754
00:48:23,340 --> 00:48:26,110
Every fucking word that comes out
of your mouth is one less war.

755
00:48:26,111 --> 00:48:29,610
It was one word closer to the end of
whatever the fuck it is you're saying.

756
00:48:30,510 --> 00:48:33,620
You know,
that's when you know,

757
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,620
you know the passive aggressive movies
is when someone's in the middle of that

758
00:48:36,650 --> 00:48:41,150
is you, you fucking as some just kind
of pointed, somebody pointed some plate,

759
00:48:41,180 --> 00:48:44,480
you know,
little fucking give me that butter.

760
00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:46,760
They'll still yammering on.
You know,

761
00:48:47,780 --> 00:48:51,310
you know back in 1983 when we
first saw this house, right?

762
00:48:51,311 --> 00:48:53,240
And you just sit there
butter in your fucking roll.

763
00:48:56,870 --> 00:49:00,470
Oh is this mother fucker gonna go
every goddamn year from 1983 hey,

764
00:49:00,471 --> 00:49:05,450
you know what? Fair enough. Fair enough.
Yeah. I didn't want to wear this sweater.

765
00:49:05,510 --> 00:49:09,800
Right?
He's fucking have these potatoes,

766
00:49:09,830 --> 00:49:13,910
instant these fucking potatoes and
hey, fair enough. Hey, you didn't,

767
00:49:13,911 --> 00:49:18,500
you didn't have time to fucking cook real
ones. Maybe they ran out of up, down.

768
00:49:18,501 --> 00:49:21,230
The quote is the last fucking time
they ever ran out of potatoes.

769
00:49:22,490 --> 00:49:24,170
They never run out of
potatoes in this country.

770
00:49:24,171 --> 00:49:28,520
It's why somebody fucking Irish people
over here, right? Fucking Irishmen,

771
00:49:28,521 --> 00:49:32,000
they tapped out on their own country
one fucking time in their whole history.

772
00:49:32,001 --> 00:49:35,540
They run out of potatoes and
everybody fucking jumped ship. Right?

773
00:49:35,720 --> 00:49:37,280
But not the real Irishman,

774
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:41,660
the real Irish men and real
lady say fuck it stuck around.

775
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:48,000
I like these cowards that I'll
move to fucking New Jersey. Um,

776
00:49:48,060 --> 00:49:50,670
but you know what a fair enough,
you know, they wanted some potatoes.

777
00:49:55,500 --> 00:50:00,150
This is one of these days people,
you know, and if you're younger man,

778
00:50:00,550 --> 00:50:03,600
you got to enjoy the holidays cause
cause they're never going to get,

779
00:50:03,660 --> 00:50:07,440
it doesn't get better than you know,
cause you don't know any better.

780
00:50:07,441 --> 00:50:11,370
So the food tastes the way the fucking
food is supposed to taste in your world,

781
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:14,430
right? Everyone who's
supposed to be there is there,

782
00:50:15,010 --> 00:50:15,843
you know?

783
00:50:17,830 --> 00:50:20,430
So when you get older and you start
expanding your fucking world and all of a

784
00:50:20,431 --> 00:50:22,830
sudden you know Jesus Christ,

785
00:50:22,860 --> 00:50:25,230
I mean you're sitting there with somebody
you might've given me up me and might

786
00:50:25,231 --> 00:50:26,550
be sitting at that fucking table being,

787
00:50:26,551 --> 00:50:28,490
I don't even know if I'm with
the right person right now.

788
00:50:29,820 --> 00:50:34,350
What the fuck am I take? You know,
what hey say with be fair enough.

789
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:39,660
I'm with somebody that I probably was
never really in love with but didn't

790
00:50:39,661 --> 00:50:43,710
realize what love was. You
know, and now here I am,

791
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:45,220
okay.

792
00:50:45,220 --> 00:50:50,200
And all I gotta do is not get in
an argument for one fucking day.

793
00:50:50,350 --> 00:50:55,350
I can do this right by Saturday I want
to be out of this fucking relationship

794
00:50:56,080 --> 00:50:58,630
and you know what all I'm
going to be thankful then

795
00:51:00,290 --> 00:51:01,990
you bet your sweet fucking

796
00:51:04,410 --> 00:51:05,243
mmm

797
00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:11,590
oh my God. If it starts going into
politics, that starts going into politics.

798
00:51:11,690 --> 00:51:15,740
You almost need like a referee during
this period of us history to just

799
00:51:15,741 --> 00:51:18,340
literally step in with
one of those footlocker,

800
00:51:18,470 --> 00:51:21,980
fucking athlete's foot ref shirts,
blow of fucking whistle.

801
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:25,940
And just send the two people
to opposite fucking Lazy Boys.

802
00:51:27,230 --> 00:51:27,900
Let it go.

803
00:51:27,900 --> 00:51:32,720
Letter to Aa. It's all, it's all, she
went home. She went home solver. Okay.

804
00:51:33,170 --> 00:51:36,950
She's not coming back.
I don't think she's got a third runner.

805
00:51:37,480 --> 00:51:38,313
All right.

806
00:51:39,630 --> 00:51:44,060
Sorry. Sit down. Sit down. Sit Down Buddy.
Nobody's building a wall today. Okay.

807
00:51:44,061 --> 00:51:47,450
Just fucking relax.
Maybe it could be the peacemaker.

808
00:51:48,470 --> 00:51:52,970
Who knows who the fuck knows.
Um, I'm actually very excited.

809
00:51:52,971 --> 00:51:56,840
You wouldn't know it this
year for Thanksgiving because
I'm back at my house. Um,

810
00:51:58,220 --> 00:52:02,810
yeah, there's going to be a
lot of arguments today and
it'll be a victory if I'm,

811
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:06,320
you know,
if you don't get in one,

812
00:52:06,980 --> 00:52:10,670
maybe it could be that person that keeps
everybody out of it is everybody starts

813
00:52:10,671 --> 00:52:14,190
screaming and yelling. You know, you
know, he's a fucking sex offender,

814
00:52:14,210 --> 00:52:15,290
blah blah blah.
Well,

815
00:52:15,291 --> 00:52:18,820
she's a fucking day and all that type of
shit and you can be in the back. I like

816
00:52:19,450 --> 00:52:20,650
anybody tried this,

817
00:52:23,220 --> 00:52:26,710
just walk right in the middle of it.
Oh Man.

818
00:52:26,711 --> 00:52:31,420
I want to see a compilation of youtube
videos of the political fucking,

819
00:52:33,020 --> 00:52:33,580
okay.

820
00:52:33,580 --> 00:52:35,910
I've almost said discourse.
That's probably the wrong fucking word.

821
00:52:37,080 --> 00:52:37,620
Okay.

822
00:52:37,620 --> 00:52:40,140
Do you realize how many fucking words
I know that I don't even know what the

823
00:52:40,141 --> 00:52:42,210
fuck they mean.
I just know what words they go with.

824
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:47,990
You know, discourse goes with
political, political discourse.

825
00:52:49,790 --> 00:52:50,623
You know,

826
00:52:51,850 --> 00:52:54,030
you used the word or Nate
when you're in a theater.

827
00:52:56,040 --> 00:53:00,930
I Dunno what it means. I, you know, I
remember, you know, I got a computer.

828
00:53:00,931 --> 00:53:03,720
I can look at any, fair
enough. I can look it up.

829
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:05,200
Why am I going to bore
you guys with the ship?

830
00:53:25,940 --> 00:53:26,773
[inaudible]

831
00:53:37,790 --> 00:53:38,623
Karen

832
00:53:52,830 --> 00:53:53,080
[inaudible].

833
00:53:53,080 --> 00:53:53,950
Hey,
what's going on?

834
00:53:53,951 --> 00:53:58,210
It's bill burr and it is the
Monday morning podcast for Monday,

835
00:53:58,270 --> 00:54:02,590
November 23rd. Listen to my
voice. Does it sound tired?

836
00:54:03,060 --> 00:54:06,040
Does it sound sexy?
Um,

837
00:54:06,670 --> 00:54:10,420
I just got back from the Improv in Tempe,
Arizona and uh,

what does that my 11th fucking week on
the road in the last couple of weeks.

840
00:54:16,340 --> 00:54:19,300
That doesn't make sense. Mathematically.
I whatever, I been on the road a lot.

841
00:54:19,301 --> 00:54:21,520
My fucking voice is tired. So, uh,

vibe for you this Monday. And, uh,

843
00:54:27,730 --> 00:54:31,870
I imagine some of you will complain.
I liked it better when you were angrier.

844
00:54:33,250 --> 00:54:37,270
Go Fuck Yourself. How about that?
Is that angry enough for you? Okay.

845
00:54:37,271 --> 00:54:40,990
I don't really have the fucking
energy to get as mad as I usually do,

846
00:54:40,991 --> 00:54:45,880
but just know, you know that I'm
thinking hateful thoughts towards you.

847
00:54:46,060 --> 00:54:49,530
All right? You fucking angry. Cons. See,

848
00:54:49,780 --> 00:54:52,960
that's why you gotta Watch out who you
surround yourself with is because when

849
00:54:52,961 --> 00:54:57,730
you actually make a positive step
in your life, for example, uh,

850
00:54:57,760 --> 00:55:01,930
being less angry, they actually, they try
to make it seem like it's a bad thing.

851
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:07,840
Dude. You Change, man. You fucking change.
Look at you, you're smiling, you're happy.

852
00:55:08,410 --> 00:55:12,910
You know, what are you doing? You
know what I'm doing right now?

853
00:55:12,911 --> 00:55:17,530
I'm sitting here on my fucking couch
in the living room and it is my fucking

854
00:55:17,531 --> 00:55:20,320
couch. If I was on the Sofa, I
just sales on the cell phone.

855
00:55:20,350 --> 00:55:23,920
That's what I have in my living room.
I have a sofa and I have a fucking couch.

856
00:55:24,550 --> 00:55:26,800
The fucking couch is fucking comfortable,

857
00:55:27,370 --> 00:55:32,320
hence its name and I'm on it
because I'm fucking tired. Um,

858
00:55:32,650 --> 00:55:36,350
let's try to hype my shit. Let's try
to be smart with this podcast, uh,

859
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:38,710
to begin with. Um, all right.

860
00:55:38,711 --> 00:55:43,711
I'm doing a stand up special I next hour
long special of filth and silly faces,

861
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:50,110
which might be the name. It'd be a
good name, Huh? Filson silly faces. Um,

862
00:55:51,940 --> 00:55:56,380
maybe this, I don't fucking know. Listen
to me. I'm exhausted. Fucking exhausted.

863
00:55:56,410 --> 00:55:57,310
All right.
Uh,

864
00:55:57,311 --> 00:56:02,311
I'm going to be taping it at the Fillmore
in San Francisco on December 17th.

865
00:56:02,321 --> 00:56:06,850
I'm doing two shows,
one at one time and one at another time.

866
00:56:09,970 --> 00:56:12,850
I don't have the information, but I
do have the link right on my website.

867
00:56:12,851 --> 00:56:17,290
If you go onto a billboard.com
and you go down to a, you know,

868
00:56:17,291 --> 00:56:20,830
scroll down on the lower left hand corner
and you will get to the link and it'll

869
00:56:20,831 --> 00:56:24,010

870
00:56:24,010 --> 00:56:27,700
Julio Iglesias,
um,

871
00:56:27,730 --> 00:56:30,370
fucking men at work.
You know,

872
00:56:31,690 --> 00:56:34,570
what's the name of that other group
is the name of that fucking group.

873
00:56:34,571 --> 00:56:35,770
What was the name of the group?

874
00:56:35,771 --> 00:56:38,890
It was the name of the song and it was
the name of the album in a lead singer

875
00:56:38,891 --> 00:56:43,540
killed himself. There's a trivia
question. Do you remember it?

876
00:56:43,570 --> 00:56:46,120
Early eighties big country.

877
00:56:47,530 --> 00:56:49,210
There was a band called big country.

878
00:56:49,240 --> 00:56:52,660
They had an album called big country
and the name of their hit song was big

879
00:56:52,661 --> 00:56:54,910
country.
Needless to say,

880
00:56:55,720 --> 00:56:58,360
with a well of talent
like that to pull from,

881
00:56:59,050 --> 00:57:01,090
I dunno how they only had one hit song.

882
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:08,230
We're called cupcake is our
thong cupcake offer album cupcake

883
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:14,200
fucking cupcake to Lou and then that's it.

884
00:57:14,201 --> 00:57:15,880
I mean what the fuck is wrong with you?

885
00:57:15,881 --> 00:57:18,730
Don't think about switching
it up a little bit.

886
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:21,850
It's actually isn't funny cause the
lead singer ended up killing himself.

887
00:57:23,260 --> 00:57:27,370
You know the song should've been called
continent I. What was I thinking?

888
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:32,530
Um, anyways, so if you go on,
you go on the live nation.com.

889
00:57:32,531 --> 00:57:36,700
Let me see if I can even fucking do it.
If I even can find tickets to my special,

890
00:57:36,730 --> 00:57:40,420
I'll go to bill burr.com I am blue. I'll
look at that. What a good looking guy.

891
00:57:41,140 --> 00:57:44,980
All right, I'm going to click on the
link and it takes me to live nation.com.

892
00:57:44,981 --> 00:57:47,760
Let me do this with you because so many
of you fucking idiots are going to,

893
00:57:48,100 --> 00:57:50,430
I couldn't find it.
I did.

894
00:57:50,530 --> 00:57:54,160
I clicked on the link and it
didn't do everything for me. A,

895
00:57:54,161 --> 00:57:56,410
I don't know what to do.
You know what it's like.

896
00:57:56,470 --> 00:57:59,860
That's like those Douche bags
you see on youtube. By the way,

897
00:57:59,861 --> 00:58:01,750
you can learn how to play drums,
guitar,

898
00:58:01,810 --> 00:58:04,570
a fucking Sitar or whatever you
want to learn, right on youtube.

899
00:58:04,571 --> 00:58:08,560
Somebody is going to show you how
to play, uh, you know a Didgeridoo.

900
00:58:09,160 --> 00:58:14,110
So these fucking guys get on there and
they show you. Exactly. They slow it down.

901
00:58:14,120 --> 00:58:18,550
They show you how to play it. And
people still ask for tabs. Great video.

902
00:58:18,551 --> 00:58:20,200
But do you have any tabs?

903
00:58:20,530 --> 00:58:24,490
Why don't you just ask the guy to fucking
go over there and put your fingers on

904
00:58:24,491 --> 00:58:27,650
the Fret Board for you? You're
lazy. Fuck. Oh, there's Lamponeli.

905
00:58:27,900 --> 00:58:29,900
They got a nice picture of
Lisa Lampanelli on. Now.

906
00:58:29,901 --> 00:58:34,900
Let's see if my picture comes up.
Now goes right to fucking you too.

907
00:58:36,500 --> 00:58:37,010
Okay.

908
00:58:37,010 --> 00:58:41,810
And some guy with a cowboy hat named Brad
Paisley on his American Saturday night

909
00:58:41,811 --> 00:58:45,380
tour. All right, let's see if
there's some sort of search here.

910
00:58:47,210 --> 00:58:51,810
All right, let's go to
the bees. Blue Rodeo.

911
00:58:52,620 --> 00:58:56,370
Bob Dylan,
boys like girls brand new Brandi Carlile.

912
00:58:57,270 --> 00:59:01,760
Brian Regan and know me
well, that's good. Well,

913
00:59:01,761 --> 00:59:06,450
I'm glad I fucking did this.
Why don't we do this on sale now?

914
00:59:06,510 --> 00:59:11,160
Top 10 tours. I know that's not going
to be me. Top 10 venues, the Fillmore.

915
00:59:11,730 --> 00:59:15,450
Bam. That's what you do. All right,
so you get on the homepage, all right?

916
00:59:15,630 --> 00:59:19,080
And then you, uh, scroll down,

919
00:59:26,840 --> 00:59:31,070
And then you scroll down. Let's see.
He was going to be playing there.

920
00:59:31,071 --> 00:59:36,050
The Black Crowes
Lo Los Lobos bill bar right there.

921
00:59:36,830 --> 00:59:38,540
So that's what you do.
All right?

922
00:59:38,660 --> 00:59:42,140
So I don't need any fucking emails from
you whiny bitches about how you can't

923
00:59:42,141 --> 00:59:46,820
find fucking tickets, cause I just
did it in real time. All right?

924
00:59:46,821 --> 00:59:47,690
So anyways,
as I said,

925
00:59:47,691 --> 00:59:51,110
I'm sitting on my fucking couch here and
I'm actually watching a replay of the

926
00:59:51,111 --> 00:59:55,270
Bruin sabers game. I don't know who
wins. Don't fucking tell me. Um,

927
00:59:55,340 --> 00:59:56,000
that's what I do.

928
00:59:56,000 --> 01:00:00,450
I tape all the hockey games and I come
back like a fucking scout and I watch

929
01:00:00,451 --> 01:00:04,100
like seven games. I already watched
when the Bruins beat the, uh,

930
01:00:04,190 --> 01:00:06,700
Atlanta thrashers and I
gotta tell you something.

931
01:00:06,860 --> 01:00:10,940
They got a great fucking team and I
don't know why they have an NHL team in

932
01:00:10,941 --> 01:00:14,650
Atlanta because you should,

933
01:00:14,750 --> 01:00:17,600
you should have seen the amount of silica.
I got fucking AA meeting.

934
01:00:17,630 --> 01:00:22,430
That's how many people were there for
the fucking thrashers game, you know?

935
01:00:22,490 --> 01:00:27,320
And they got eagle yet Koval chuck and
a couple other fucking guys with names.

936
01:00:27,321 --> 01:00:29,210
Like they should be
working the Russian border,

937
01:00:29,270 --> 01:00:32,450
but they're fucking great players. But I
don't understand why did they put what,

938
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:35,690
what the fuck is wrong with the NHL?
Why did they put another team in Atlanta?

939
01:00:37,220 --> 01:00:37,760
You know,

940
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:41,870
I don't understand cities that fail in a
sport and then get another opportunity.

941
01:00:42,860 --> 01:00:43,191
You know,

942
01:00:43,191 --> 01:00:47,510
I'm one of the few people that understands
why Los Angeles doesn't have an NFL

943
01:00:47,511 --> 01:00:51,650
team. Well, let's say you had two
of them and you'll, they both left.

944
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:57,300
You know right there. I mean, granted,
I don't know why the fuck they left.

945
01:00:57,360 --> 01:00:59,720
Typical me. I don't know what
the fuck I'm talking about,

946
01:01:00,080 --> 01:01:04,940
but all I know is you don't put
fucking hockey in Atlanta. All right?

947
01:01:04,970 --> 01:01:06,080
If the fact that the,

948
01:01:06,081 --> 01:01:10,790
the original Atlanta
flames left 30 years ago,

949
01:01:10,791 --> 01:01:12,350
if that wasn't enough of a tip,

950
01:01:12,440 --> 01:01:15,050
why don't you listen to parliament
and they'll let you know that it's a

951
01:01:15,051 --> 01:01:16,040
chocolate city.

952
01:01:19,670 --> 01:01:23,210
You know who the fuck is
from Atlanta Little Wayne.

953
01:01:24,350 --> 01:01:27,680
You've got everyone from like
little Wayne to like rem.

954
01:01:27,980 --> 01:01:31,150
And I'm going to go out on a limb here
and I'm going to say, Michael Stipe isn't,

955
01:01:31,190 --> 01:01:34,880
he doesn't strike me as a
fucking hockey fan. You know,

956
01:01:34,980 --> 01:01:37,760
the fuck is wrong with you. So
anyways, I'm watching the game.

957
01:01:37,761 --> 01:01:40,790
There's like 30 people in the crowd.
There's no fucking energy whatsoever.

958
01:01:41,120 --> 01:01:43,760
But now I'm watching the
Bruin sabers and I always, uh,

959
01:01:44,330 --> 01:01:46,790
never the Bruins play the Sabres.
I have to listen to the, uh,

960
01:01:46,791 --> 01:01:49,490
the sabers announcer.
I Dunno what the fucking guy's name is,

961
01:01:49,491 --> 01:01:51,380
but I swear to God he could make,

962
01:01:52,280 --> 01:01:55,250
he can make watching somebody sit
waiting for a bus. Sound exciting.

963
01:01:55,251 --> 01:01:57,710
He's one of the best guys in the leaks.
I always watch that fucking guy.

964
01:01:57,711 --> 01:02:02,060
So that's what I'm doing. Was that boring?
I hope it was. Cause I'm fucking tired.

965
01:02:02,840 --> 01:02:07,400
I'm really country this week. Um,
uh, why am I being an asshole?

966
01:02:07,401 --> 01:02:11,160
It's thanksgiving. Thanksgiving is
come up is coming up. Let me, uh,

967
01:02:11,210 --> 01:02:14,180
let me switch the tone
here. Um, you know people,

968
01:02:14,181 --> 01:02:17,120
this is a week when everyone,

969
01:02:17,180 --> 01:02:20,340
all Americans should sit
down, okay? When those fucking

970
01:02:20,950 --> 01:02:23,880
Douche bags get on TV,
you know,

971
01:02:24,030 --> 01:02:27,960
with their ear muffs and their
little fucking NBC gloves,

972
01:02:28,180 --> 01:02:30,900
they're fucking overcoats with the
floats going by in the background,

973
01:02:30,901 --> 01:02:34,470
they start telling you about why you
should be so fucking thankful for your

974
01:02:34,471 --> 01:02:36,780
fucking miserable life.
You know,

975
01:02:37,890 --> 01:02:42,030
we now maybe if I was on
network television, you know,

976
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:44,730
where the cashmere coat that I
didn't have to fucking pay for.

977
01:02:44,731 --> 01:02:48,570
I could enjoy my Turkey a
little more this year. You know,

978
01:02:50,040 --> 01:02:52,770
you know what all Americans
should be given. Thanks right now.

979
01:02:52,920 --> 01:02:56,700
This should be sitting around going, what
the fuck happened? For whatever reason,

980
01:02:56,701 --> 01:03:00,600
everything from the bankers to that
fucking twats dropped you out of nowhere.

981
01:03:01,390 --> 01:03:05,250
He's supposed to sit there and happy and
you're catatonic state with cranberry

982
01:03:05,251 --> 01:03:10,170
sauce dripping down your fucking chin.
You know I can't [inaudible].

983
01:03:10,330 --> 01:03:13,260
You know, this is such a great fucking
holiday. If you don't listen to anybody,

984
01:03:13,261 --> 01:03:15,780
you know you don't have to buy any gifts.
And by the way,

985
01:03:16,950 --> 01:03:20,400
Wednesday of this week for
all you drunks out there,

986
01:03:20,401 --> 01:03:21,780
I know you know this information,

987
01:03:21,781 --> 01:03:25,440
but just bear with me for all you
amateur drinkers, drinkers out there.

988
01:03:25,620 --> 01:03:26,640
This is the best.

989
01:03:27,150 --> 01:03:31,920
The Wednesday before Thanksgiving is
the best night of drinking all year.

990
01:03:31,950 --> 01:03:34,500
Hands down. All right? It's not new years.

991
01:03:35,190 --> 01:03:39,100
You know when all his fucking idiots go
out with this silly hats and those noise

992
01:03:39,101 --> 01:03:43,050
makers, why anyone goes out that
night, his fucking beyond me.

993
01:03:43,051 --> 01:03:45,960
Unless you're out there telling jokes
trying to make money, which I understand.

994
01:03:47,060 --> 01:03:47,893
All right

995
01:03:49,410 --> 01:03:53,550
that night and Saint Patrick's day and
everyone's got their green plastic hats

996
01:03:54,200 --> 01:03:58,650
and they're singing those stupid fucking
Saiad at green alligator and along net

997
01:03:58,680 --> 01:04:03,420
goes, why are all eating corn beef
sandwiches? Let me ask you this.

998
01:04:03,480 --> 01:04:05,250
During the course of the fucking year,

999
01:04:05,610 --> 01:04:07,980
the amount of times you go out
to eat and grab a sandwich,

1000
01:04:08,060 --> 01:04:11,910
do you ever order a corned beef sandwich?
She had doubt caution down.

1001
01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:14,610
Does anybody even know what animal
that comes from? Cause I don't

1002
01:04:16,230 --> 01:04:19,860
corn beef is that Ah,
that's cattle, right? Beef.

1003
01:04:20,460 --> 01:04:24,390
Pork is a pig.
I fucking know.

1004
01:04:25,110 --> 01:04:28,350
You know,
you know as I was riffing about this week,

1005
01:04:28,351 --> 01:04:31,230
and I'll actually talk about it here in
the podcast because I don't give a fuck

1006
01:04:31,231 --> 01:04:33,570
about burning this joke just
cause it's a topical joke.

1007
01:04:33,571 --> 01:04:38,571
Why did they stop calling it the swine
flu and did all the farmers complain?

1008
01:04:39,270 --> 01:04:41,340
We ain't going to be able
sell no fucking pigs.

1009
01:04:41,430 --> 01:04:44,610
You keep calling it
the swine flu you want,

1010
01:04:44,820 --> 01:04:49,050
you want bacon up here fucking eyeballs
and every fucking pig warehouse out

1011
01:04:49,051 --> 01:04:52,320
there,
you know and don't even act like it.

1012
01:04:52,321 --> 01:04:54,750
Don't affect it because the government's
going to have to buy it back.

1013
01:04:55,040 --> 01:04:57,270
So why don't you come up
with a new fucking name for

1014
01:04:59,910 --> 01:05:03,300
h one n one is not the
name of a fucking plague,

1015
01:05:04,950 --> 01:05:09,530
the black death. That's the name of
a plague. All right. You know what?

1016
01:05:09,570 --> 01:05:10,860
Let me fucking look that up.

1017
01:05:11,250 --> 01:05:14,610
That's what's pissing me off
here is we finally got a plague.

1018
01:05:15,390 --> 01:05:17,710
You know something that I've been for

1019
01:05:17,980 --> 01:05:21,520
for a long fucking time.
Imagine if I ended up getting it.

1020
01:05:21,690 --> 01:05:22,780
They'd play this at my funeral.

1021
01:05:23,880 --> 01:05:28,690
Well, you know, we uh, he died
away wanting to die. I mean,

1022
01:05:28,691 --> 01:05:30,190
the guy was into the fucking

1023
01:05:30,940 --> 01:05:34,030
swine flu. Let me, let
me, let me search here.

1024
01:05:34,031 --> 01:05:37,300
Great plagues.
There's no way.

1025
01:05:37,301 --> 01:05:40,840
I'm not on some FBI fucking watch
list after this goddamn search.

1026
01:05:41,260 --> 01:05:44,020
How to fuck yourself spell plague.
I know it's not that way.

1027
01:05:44,620 --> 01:05:49,570
Pla gue great plagues did you mean I like
that after you should be fucking spell

1028
01:05:49,571 --> 01:05:53,740
it wrong and then Google's like, did
you mean this? You're fucking moron.

1029
01:05:53,800 --> 01:05:54,730
Of course I did.

1030
01:05:56,790 --> 01:05:56,990
Yeah.

1031
01:05:56,990 --> 01:05:59,220
All right. I guess there was
one called the great plague.

1032
01:06:00,780 --> 01:06:05,400
What do I need to search? Awesome plagues,
plagues. I want, I just search plagues.

1033
01:06:06,550 --> 01:06:08,940
All right.
This is a long fucking way to go.

1034
01:06:08,941 --> 01:06:11,850
Just tell you why that they should
still call it the fucking swine flu.

1035
01:06:12,780 --> 01:06:17,220
The 10 plagues of Egypt, Jesus
Christ, and one of the fluff.

1036
01:06:17,250 --> 01:06:21,030
So fucking skinny over there, Huh?
Time you turn around them. Mess.

1037
01:06:21,031 --> 01:06:25,440
A great way to lose weight. 10 plagues
in a row, even if you survive it, right?

1038
01:06:25,680 --> 01:06:28,860
There's no way you're going to be more
than a buck 40 are Egyptian skinny.

1039
01:06:28,861 --> 01:06:32,850
I don't even know what they are.
The only Egyptian I know is Anwar Sadat,

1040
01:06:33,900 --> 01:06:38,700
right? The 10 plagues. Ah,
who gives a fuck? All right.

1041
01:06:39,180 --> 01:06:42,960
Wait, the plague of lice,
the plague of flies.

1042
01:06:42,990 --> 01:06:45,990
What does it some biblical Shit I fucking
give up. You know what I'm saying?

1043
01:06:45,991 --> 01:06:50,190
They swine flu. That's a great
name. We'll think about it.

1044
01:06:50,191 --> 01:06:52,920
If you could just put yourself a
hundred years in the hit in history.

1045
01:06:53,220 --> 01:06:55,650
If you look back and they talk about,
you know,

1046
01:06:55,730 --> 01:07:00,650
when we're old we talk about it,
you know, every day was going great.

1047
01:07:00,651 --> 01:07:04,280
And then in 2009 the swine flu came.

1048
01:07:05,660 --> 01:07:06,150
Yeah.

1049
01:07:06,150 --> 01:07:10,950
G J GRANDPA. Where did the swine flu come
from? I'll tell you where I cam from.

1050
01:07:10,951 --> 01:07:13,140
Some foreign are fucked or fucking peg.

1051
01:07:18,190 --> 01:07:20,980
Have you guys noticed that?
All the new diseases,

1052
01:07:21,640 --> 01:07:25,450
there's never any sort of scientific
explanation of where they come from.

1053
01:07:25,750 --> 01:07:30,610
So all you can do is go get down to
your local bar and listen to people

1054
01:07:30,611 --> 01:07:35,260
hypothesize. I Dunno if you've
noticed, but anytime you go into a bar,

1055
01:07:35,440 --> 01:07:39,490
if you ask where a disease came from,
that's the answer you always get.

1056
01:07:39,640 --> 01:07:44,530
Somebody from another country had sex with
an animal and now we're all gonna die.

1057
01:07:45,700 --> 01:07:49,210
Ever since AIDS, remember that?
Do, I'll tell you what happened.

1058
01:07:49,211 --> 01:07:52,990
Somebody fucking blew a monkey and
then they fucked her store that's in,

1059
01:07:52,991 --> 01:07:57,700
there you go. You know, you always have
to have some sort of nationalism in it.

1060
01:07:57,730 --> 01:08:00,880
You know, don't, you don't see anybody
fucking pigs in this country. Right?

1061
01:08:01,660 --> 01:08:03,640
It's why we need to close the borders.

1062
01:08:06,570 --> 01:08:09,330
Ah, fuck. Yeah. I think the swine
flu would be great. You know,

1063
01:08:09,780 --> 01:08:12,630
it'd be a nice cleansing,
a nice cleansing,

1064
01:08:14,490 --> 01:08:17,000
get rid of, of punchy, you know,
you're not going to die of it.

1065
01:08:17,001 --> 01:08:19,940
Just take some vitamins, put
on a sweater, you'll be fine.

1066
01:08:19,970 --> 01:08:23,120
It's just going to kill the week.
And that's what needs to happen.

1067
01:08:23,450 --> 01:08:27,470
If you notice every other animal,
all the strong survive,

1068
01:08:27,530 --> 01:08:30,410
all the weak die the,
and that's why there's no,

1069
01:08:30,650 --> 01:08:33,650
there's no traffic in the
squirrel community. Have you ever,

1070
01:08:33,651 --> 01:08:37,970
have you ever just seen just a
fucking highways worth of squirrels,

1071
01:08:39,160 --> 01:08:39,940
you know,

1072
01:08:39,940 --> 01:08:42,820
peaking over each other's shoulders trying
to figure out what the fuck is going

1073
01:08:42,821 --> 01:08:46,330
on up front as are all waiting
to try to get some fucking

1074
01:08:47,750 --> 01:08:48,583
yeah.

1075
01:08:48,790 --> 01:08:51,460
Not or whatever the fuck they eat.
You know, you don't, you know why?

1076
01:08:51,461 --> 01:08:55,990
Because they did cause the weak
don't survive. And the problem is,

1077
01:08:57,160 --> 01:08:59,590
is we have medicine and
we keep saving people.

1078
01:08:59,620 --> 01:09:04,620
And that's why you can't get an empty row
on a plane anymore because seated next

1079
01:09:05,441 --> 01:09:10,320
to you or two fucking people who should
have died 30 fucking years ago, you know,

1080
01:09:10,410 --> 01:09:12,010
and if you don't believe me,
watch them.

1081
01:09:12,011 --> 01:09:15,040
Try to get their oversized
bag into the fucking, uh,

1082
01:09:15,041 --> 01:09:18,520
overhead compartment and
watch how their brain works.

1083
01:09:18,760 --> 01:09:21,850
As you're sitting there visually seeing
why doesn't he just turn it sideways?

1084
01:09:22,780 --> 01:09:25,480
If he has it going that way,
there's no way the door can close.

1085
01:09:25,481 --> 01:09:27,610
I can't believe he just tried
to close the door again.

1086
01:09:27,940 --> 01:09:31,750
Are you a fucking moron then? I like when
they're sitting there with a suitcase,

1087
01:09:31,751 --> 01:09:36,220
which I don't know if you've
noticed is a solid object. Okay.

1088
01:09:36,460 --> 01:09:40,480
And it's in the shape that it's in.
You can't push it in further.

1089
01:09:40,481 --> 01:09:45,400
Like it's a fucking beanbag and it's going
to take the shape of the compartment.

1090
01:09:45,401 --> 01:09:49,840
Like it's some sort of water based
thing. Alright. Jesus Christ,

1091
01:09:50,650 --> 01:09:54,640
Cleo. Oh my God, fucking
dog. Just farted really bad.

1092
01:09:55,480 --> 01:09:59,620
Really? You just got to lay there.
That's, you know, that's what kills me.

1093
01:09:59,621 --> 01:10:03,250
It's not that my dog farts, it's the
complete lack of guilt on her face.

1094
01:10:03,520 --> 01:10:08,370
She just doesn't give a shit.
Evidently that causes a lot of stress,

1095
01:10:08,371 --> 01:10:12,030
doesn't it? Holding farts in or
whatever. Some sort of methane gas.

1096
01:10:13,380 --> 01:10:16,830
I can tell you right now,
there's not a fucking ounce in my dog.

1097
01:10:18,780 --> 01:10:19,613
Cleo.

1098
01:10:21,140 --> 01:10:25,670
Why I bought you that nice big bed
about my dog. That's fucking insane.

1099
01:10:25,671 --> 01:10:30,380
Bed cost me like 200 bucks,
you know and I,

1100
01:10:30,381 --> 01:10:32,060
you know who spends 200 bucks in a bed?

1101
01:10:32,061 --> 01:10:34,850
I'll tell you I'd fucking dog on her
does cause that's how much you love your

1102
01:10:34,851 --> 01:10:38,990
dog. Right? And I swear to God, I've
gotten this thing there and it literally,

1103
01:10:39,650 --> 01:10:42,680
it loves this bed so much. You know
what it looks like when it's sleeves,

1104
01:10:42,681 --> 01:10:46,340
how hard this fucking dog sleeps on
the bed. You guys watch pro football.

1105
01:10:46,341 --> 01:10:50,450
You haven't noticed when somebody gets
knocked out for some reason when a wide

1106
01:10:50,451 --> 01:10:52,910
receiver gets knocked out,
this always ends up happening there.

1107
01:10:52,911 --> 01:10:57,911
Legs always end up crossed and then
they got that one arm like thing is like

1108
01:10:57,951 --> 01:11:00,140
stuck up in the air,
you know,

1109
01:11:00,141 --> 01:11:02,000
like they were right in the
middle of making a point.

1110
01:11:02,450 --> 01:11:03,620
Like they were pontificating.

1111
01:11:03,730 --> 01:11:06,110
If anybody at you haven't noticed
that that's how she fucking sleeps.

1112
01:11:06,111 --> 01:11:10,160
Her back legs get crossed and one of her
and she lays on her back and one of her

1113
01:11:10,420 --> 01:11:15,420
paws is up in the air. Like she
just got drilled by fucking ray. Um,

1114
01:11:15,810 --> 01:11:18,260
anyways, I what the fuck
I'm talking about here. Uh,

1115
01:11:19,350 --> 01:11:21,390
now I'm interested in
this 10 plagues of Egypt.

1116
01:11:21,391 --> 01:11:23,670
This has to be some sort of biblical Shit,
right?

1117
01:11:24,030 --> 01:11:27,120
That they're still fighting about today
that makes them want to kill Jews in

1118
01:11:27,121 --> 01:11:29,770
Egypt,
on Egypt and Israel as number three.

1119
01:11:29,771 --> 01:11:34,170
They always end up arguing about,
um,

1120
01:11:34,230 --> 01:11:38,610
I say you let them fight it out. That's
my solution to the Middle East. You know,

1121
01:11:39,480 --> 01:11:44,190
why don't we just pull up stakes
and let them have at it. You know,

1122
01:11:44,191 --> 01:11:47,520
you want to fucking kill each other. Go
ahead. It's great for the environment,

1123
01:11:48,940 --> 01:11:49,773
you know,

1124
01:11:51,230 --> 01:11:55,190
sort of a manmade plague. All right.
That's what I do the week of Thanksgiving,

1125
01:11:55,191 --> 01:11:59,810
I say, Oh, I'm pro war. Um, all right,
let's, let's talk about football.

1126
01:11:59,811 --> 01:12:03,020
I got a lot of shit last week
from people who are fans of, um,

1127
01:12:04,010 --> 01:12:08,900
Peyton manning for, uh, talking
about what a cry baby cry baby is.

1128
01:12:08,901 --> 01:12:11,280
And then a lot of points
that people brought up. Uh,

1129
01:12:11,330 --> 01:12:14,870
for some reason I can't fucking find them.
I don't know where the hell they are.

1130
01:12:14,930 --> 01:12:18,430
Maybe they're in junk,
but I'll basically paraphrase it.

1131
01:12:18,740 --> 01:12:19,790
Oh my God.
You're going to,

1132
01:12:19,791 --> 01:12:23,780
you're going to give Peyton manning
shitty and you can say Brady's not a cry

1133
01:12:23,781 --> 01:12:24,201
baby.

1134
01:12:24,201 --> 01:12:28,070
What about that time earlier this year
when he turned around and asked for a

1135
01:12:28,071 --> 01:12:32,110
flag and got the call?
What do you mean? Oh,

1136
01:12:32,120 --> 01:12:36,890
that's your example of Brady being a
crybaby because he got hit and he turned

1137
01:12:36,891 --> 01:12:39,650
around and asked for a fucking flag.
What you mean?

1138
01:12:39,651 --> 01:12:42,290
Like every wide receiver
when they don't catch a ball,

1139
01:12:42,320 --> 01:12:44,210
every fucking play in the NFL,

1140
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:47,210
every fucking guy gets up
bitch and looking for a flag.

1141
01:12:48,350 --> 01:12:49,490
He got the flag.

1142
01:12:49,610 --> 01:12:53,690
The same way Michael Jordan is allowed
to push off people and doesn't get called

1143
01:12:53,691 --> 01:12:57,560
for a foul cause. He's one of the
stars in the fucking league. All right,

1144
01:12:59,760 --> 01:13:02,510
and other points somebody tried to make,
they're talking about all the roughing,

1145
01:13:02,511 --> 01:13:04,400
the passer,
the Tom Brady rule.

1146
01:13:04,610 --> 01:13:09,350
Tom Brady did not fucking
campaign for that rule. He didn't.

1147
01:13:09,351 --> 01:13:12,650
That was a fucking NFL rule where
they're like, wait a minute.

1148
01:13:12,980 --> 01:13:15,350
If our pretty boy
quarterbacks aren't playing,

1149
01:13:15,590 --> 01:13:19,670
the viewership goes down and we make
less money. That was a business decision.

1150
01:13:19,671 --> 01:13:22,160
Tom Brady didn't campaign
for that fucking rule,

1151
01:13:22,310 --> 01:13:25,130
which brings me back to the crybaby.
Peyton Manning,

1152
01:13:25,610 --> 01:13:29,750
who lost a playoff game to the Patriots
and fucking cried at the end of the

1153
01:13:29,751 --> 01:13:34,460
fucking game. And then he and his
coach, Tony Dungy made a fucking a tape,

1154
01:13:34,550 --> 01:13:39,500
a game tapes sent it to the league. They
cried some more at the fucking pro bowl.

1155
01:13:39,680 --> 01:13:42,800
Two weeks later, a week after
the Patriots won another title,

1156
01:13:43,300 --> 01:13:46,940
they're fucking crying again about it
and then he cried about it at the draft.

1157
01:13:47,090 --> 01:13:48,620
That's why he's a fucking baby.

1158
01:13:48,740 --> 01:13:52,190
And I forgot to bring up the fact when
he didn't win the Heisman trophy that's

1159
01:13:52,191 --> 01:13:55,760
on fucking youtube.
I believe Ricky Williams won it that year.

1160
01:13:55,880 --> 01:13:56,760
And when he didn't win it,

1161
01:13:56,900 --> 01:14:00,710
the look of entitlement would
you professional quarterback.

1162
01:14:00,711 --> 01:14:04,730
I always prayed for this. That fucking
look on his face. He's a fucking baby.

1163
01:14:05,540 --> 01:14:10,040
Tom Brady has never lost a game and
then thrown his teammates under the bus.

1164
01:14:10,700 --> 01:14:12,490
Peyton manning has.
How many fucking

1165
01:14:12,490 --> 01:14:14,950
more examples do you need?
All right.

1166
01:14:14,951 --> 01:14:18,700
You jackasses with your fucking
surrogate fucking team out there.

1167
01:14:18,760 --> 01:14:23,540
It's the Baltimore Colts, by the way.
All right. Or Colts. When I say Boston,

1168
01:14:24,460 --> 01:14:26,860
Baltimore Coats, I don't
fucking know. Fuck all you guys.

1169
01:14:26,890 --> 01:14:30,400
You just fucking hate the patriots because
we fucking went. And what did I say?

1170
01:14:30,610 --> 01:14:33,940
Did I not say that the Patriots
were going to fucking kill the jets,

1171
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:37,150
which we did yesterday.
Other than that little brief hiccup,

1172
01:14:38,410 --> 01:14:43,300
31 14 all right.
And I called that Rex Ryan Shit too.

1173
01:14:43,870 --> 01:14:48,220
I've been saying it since the third
week. Rex Ryan, that poor bastard,

1174
01:14:48,221 --> 01:14:49,570
the guy's out of his fucking mind.

1175
01:14:50,170 --> 01:14:53,020
He's gonna make a halfhearted
attempt at his life this week. I did.

1176
01:14:53,110 --> 01:14:55,270
My prediction is he's going to break his,

1177
01:14:55,330 --> 01:15:00,160
he's gonna break his tailbone trying to
hang himself and yes, that is a fat joke.

1178
01:15:00,580 --> 01:15:03,370
All right.
I think I already did this on a podcast.

1179
01:15:03,370 --> 01:15:05,380
My psychological breakdown of Rex Ryan,

1180
01:15:06,550 --> 01:15:08,830
this is when I knew that guy
was out of his mind. Okay.

1181
01:15:08,860 --> 01:15:11,680
When he first said when the Patriots
were going to play him and he was like,

1182
01:15:11,681 --> 01:15:15,220
you know, I'm not here to kiss their
rings. I thought it was funny and like,

1183
01:15:15,221 --> 01:15:18,280
I like this guy, you know,
even though he's a coach of
the jets, he's talking shit.

1184
01:15:18,760 --> 01:15:22,870
But then there was that week when a
player from another team said something

1185
01:15:22,871 --> 01:15:25,480
derogatory about them and
he actually responded to it,

1186
01:15:25,580 --> 01:15:30,190
a hedge co head coach responding to some
player on another team and he's trying

1187
01:15:30,191 --> 01:15:32,860
to act all cocky and confident and
there was something about his smile.

1188
01:15:32,861 --> 01:15:33,880
I saw it in his face.
I'm like,

1189
01:15:33,881 --> 01:15:38,470
this guy fucking cries himself to sleep
every night with a pint of fucking ice

1190
01:15:38,471 --> 01:15:39,304
cream.

1191
01:15:39,830 --> 01:15:40,663
You know,

1192
01:15:42,260 --> 01:15:45,320
this is what I think happened.
All right? His Dad, Buddy Ryan,

1193
01:15:45,321 --> 01:15:49,580
one of the great defensive coaches
came up with the 40 60 fence, you know,

1194
01:15:50,270 --> 01:15:52,910
won a Superbowl. I'll tell
ya, doing something like that,

1195
01:15:52,911 --> 01:15:55,710
you don't have time to raise your kid
and you don't have time to be there for

1196
01:15:55,820 --> 01:15:56,090
them.

1197
01:15:56,090 --> 01:16:00,300
So all this shit talk and fucking Rex
Ryan does all the shitty saying is this

1198
01:16:00,470 --> 01:16:02,760
shit he wished his dad said to
him when he was, uh, killed kid.

1199
01:16:02,761 --> 01:16:05,060
So he could have built up some
sort of confidence, but he didn't.

1200
01:16:05,150 --> 01:16:06,020
He wasn't around.

1201
01:16:06,140 --> 01:16:10,430
So the combination is still looking for
his dad's fucking approval and living in

1202
01:16:10,431 --> 01:16:15,431
the shadow of a man who created the 46
fucking defense has caused this guy to be

1203
01:16:15,951 --> 01:16:20,810
an insecure shit-talking psychopath.
And I think in his head,

1204
01:16:20,811 --> 01:16:24,710
he knows that he can coach
at the professional level,

1205
01:16:25,010 --> 01:16:30,010
but the, the fucking deafening
voice of doubt that he goes,

1206
01:16:30,030 --> 01:16:33,410
that fucking is in that guy's head. I'm
telling you, that's why you overeat.

1207
01:16:33,470 --> 01:16:37,990
He's one of those guys, you know,
when that voice in his head's going,

1208
01:16:38,560 --> 01:16:41,680
rex, what are you doing coaching
at the professional level?

1209
01:16:41,681 --> 01:16:45,520
You're not as good as your dad that got
to find out you're going to get fired.

1210
01:16:46,960 --> 01:16:47,950
You'll never coach again.

1211
01:16:47,951 --> 01:16:49,900
You're going to have to move
home with your fucking parents.

1212
01:16:50,080 --> 01:16:52,710
They're going to kick you out.
You're going to be all bless. Yeah.

1213
01:16:52,900 --> 01:16:57,850
Not Heavy baguette. Oh yeah. That's
why he eats all that ice cream.

1214
01:16:57,851 --> 01:17:00,820
He gives himself that fucking ice cream
headache and that's all you can focus on,

1215
01:17:01,210 --> 01:17:01,700
you know?
And they,

1216
01:17:01,700 --> 01:17:05,260
it takes a couple of Tylenol pms and
then he goes to sleep and the next day

1217
01:17:05,261 --> 01:17:08,740
wakes up with all that dairy product
rolling around in his fucking intestines

1218
01:17:09,530 --> 01:17:11,660
and he's hung over from
all the Tylenol PM's.

1219
01:17:11,661 --> 01:17:14,210
And then he does a press conference.
He doesn't know what the fuck he's doing.

1220
01:17:14,390 --> 01:17:19,070
He's like one of those
wrestlers, you know, he's got
the sickness. He's like, Jake,

1221
01:17:19,071 --> 01:17:22,730
the snake. If he was fat, Hey,
you know what? Speaking of which,

1222
01:17:22,731 --> 01:17:26,920
somebody asked me a question,
um, this week they said, Bill,

1223
01:17:26,930 --> 01:17:31,310
you always drop references to
wrestling on your podcast. Um,

1224
01:17:31,400 --> 01:17:32,780
and during your appearances a,

1225
01:17:32,781 --> 01:17:37,130
the ric flair mentioned suplex seeing
a girl and you've said that during your

1226
01:17:37,131 --> 01:17:38,030
standup special.

1227
01:17:38,330 --> 01:17:42,710
So are you actually a fan or were you
a fan back when you were a kid? Um,

1228
01:17:42,711 --> 01:17:45,800
I don't think I know one adult in real
life who watches wrestling and I don't

1229
01:17:45,801 --> 01:17:49,910
blame him because a lot of a time it's
corny and it's Corny as hell, but a,

1230
01:17:49,911 --> 01:17:53,540
I'm still a fan and it's just one
of those things I never grew out of.

1231
01:17:53,541 --> 01:17:56,360
And if you're a fan, who is your
all time favorite? All right. I,

1232
01:17:56,361 --> 01:17:58,130
your first guest was correct.
I was a huge

1233
01:17:58,230 --> 01:18:01,560
fan when I was a kid and,
um,

1234
01:18:02,910 --> 01:18:04,500
but ric flair,
I have to admit,

1235
01:18:04,501 --> 01:18:07,890
I got into ric flair because of one of
the listeners here when he brought up the

1236
01:18:07,891 --> 01:18:11,160
flare chop and I started watching Rick
flair and I realized what a fucking

1237
01:18:11,161 --> 01:18:15,990
genius he was. So, um, I
watched the WWF when I grew up,

1238
01:18:15,991 --> 01:18:20,640
so ric flair was in something else.
I think with the von Erickson.

1239
01:18:20,641 --> 01:18:22,450
I kind of used to watch that,
but I,

1240
01:18:22,451 --> 01:18:27,451
I watch WWF and when I first started
watching Bob Backlund was the champion.

1241
01:18:29,280 --> 01:18:34,280
And I want to say Bruno Bruno Sammartino
might've been ted DBRC was the

1242
01:18:34,591 --> 01:18:38,910
intercontinental champion until Pat
Patterson took that foreign object out of

1243
01:18:38,911 --> 01:18:43,080
his trunks, smashed him in the face with
it, and somehow the ref didn't see it.

1244
01:18:43,710 --> 01:18:46,230
Then Pat Patterson became the
intercontinental champion.

1245
01:18:47,370 --> 01:18:49,440
And let's give me a sound like the
fucking rain man, as I always do.

1246
01:18:49,441 --> 01:18:50,460
When I tried to remember this shit,

1247
01:18:51,310 --> 01:18:52,143
uh,

1248
01:18:53,250 --> 01:18:55,410
the tag team champion was Tony,

1249
01:18:55,411 --> 01:19:00,160
Gloria and Larry's of Bisco and uh,

1250
01:19:01,660 --> 01:19:06,130
oh the fuck else. I haven't put
ski Polish power bulldog Brower.

1251
01:19:07,140 --> 01:19:07,420
Yeah.

1252
01:19:07,420 --> 01:19:11,710
Mr Fuji, Mr Sado, the Moondog,
you remember the fucking Moondogs,

1253
01:19:11,830 --> 01:19:16,170
those three fat hillbillies with their
overalls and then one wouldn't be laying

1254
01:19:16,171 --> 01:19:19,950
on the floor with the dog bone. And
I was, I was scared shitless of them.

1255
01:19:20,940 --> 01:19:21,360
You know,

1256
01:19:21,360 --> 01:19:24,720
it used to scare me was George the animal
Steele when he came out with the green

1257
01:19:24,721 --> 01:19:28,320
tongue and he'd be eating the belt buckle.
I thought it was fucking real.

1258
01:19:28,980 --> 01:19:33,420
Is fucking Harry back killer Khan the
way you used to scream that big Mongolian

1259
01:19:33,421 --> 01:19:38,100
son of a bitch used to scare
the shit out of me, you know.

1260
01:19:38,240 --> 01:19:39,300
Then I realized like George,

1261
01:19:39,301 --> 01:19:42,890
the animal Steele was like a fucking
substitute teacher ought to Detroit and

1262
01:19:42,900 --> 01:19:44,760
just kind of all fell
apart. So then I, you know,

1263
01:19:44,761 --> 01:19:49,160
I watched it right through Mr.
Wonderful Rowdy Roddy Piper.

1264
01:19:50,560 --> 01:19:51,393
MMM.

1265
01:19:52,080 --> 01:19:56,130
Oh Jesse the body Ventura when
he used to call a Tito Santana,

1266
01:19:56,131 --> 01:20:01,020
used to call him Chico Santana.
I don't care about no Chico Santana.

1267
01:20:01,230 --> 01:20:03,270
I used to watch back
then and then I briefly,

1268
01:20:03,271 --> 01:20:08,220
10 years ago I got back into it cause I
was roommates with Robert Kelly and he

1269
01:20:08,221 --> 01:20:13,221
started watching the Rock
and stone cold Steve Austin.

1270
01:20:14,880 --> 01:20:18,510
I got into it briefly during then,
but I used to mainly watch, uh,

1271
01:20:18,840 --> 01:20:21,730
just the shit talking on the mic,
but it hasn't been good for awhile.

1272
01:20:21,840 --> 01:20:24,450
So there you go.
There's my long drawn out,

1273
01:20:24,900 --> 01:20:27,990
a fucking answer to your
question there. Um, all right,

1274
01:20:27,991 --> 01:20:31,370
let's get on with the podcast here.
Um, oh wait a minute at the hype.

1275
01:20:31,380 --> 01:20:35,910
One other thing. I'm really all over
the place as opposed to the usual.

1276
01:20:36,180 --> 01:20:39,030
I'm even more so all over the place.
Um,

1277
01:20:40,440 --> 01:20:45,080
I have a new website out there.
It's called a uninformed radio.com and a,

1278
01:20:45,100 --> 01:20:49,380
that's the radio show. I deal with,
uh, Joe de Rosa and myself. Uninformed,

1279
01:20:49,410 --> 01:20:53,130
no reading, no research, just strong
opinions. It's our radio show.

1280
01:20:54,490 --> 01:20:57,840
Um, we are unable to get it onto iTunes
because we're not going through some big

1281
01:20:57,841 --> 01:21:02,040
conglomerate. Um, so we're just
going to be putting them up for free.

1282
01:21:02,041 --> 01:21:05,070
You can listen for free and eventually
you'll be able to download them for a

1283
01:21:05,071 --> 01:21:08,250
buck of whack. So there you go.
That'll be your options. You know,

1284
01:21:08,480 --> 01:21:09,211
if you don't want to pay,

1285
01:21:09,211 --> 01:21:12,300
you can just sit there and listen to
it at your computer. But if you know,

1286
01:21:12,301 --> 01:21:15,030
you want to take it on your iPod
and become the hit of the year,

1287
01:21:15,031 --> 01:21:17,970
the next party you go to,
you know,

1288
01:21:18,330 --> 01:21:21,240
just in case you go to a party and
they don't have a fucking computer,

1289
01:21:23,370 --> 01:21:26,220
you can download it, you can
download it for a buck. So, uh,

1290
01:21:26,640 --> 01:21:30,930
we're going to be trying to get that
up as quickly as possible. And uh,

1291
01:21:30,931 --> 01:21:35,520
and that's it. So anyways,
really been all over the place.

1292
01:21:35,521 --> 01:21:38,490
You know what I did last last week?
No, Bill, what the fuck did you do?

1293
01:21:38,940 --> 01:21:41,660
I went and I saw,
uh,

1294
01:21:41,730 --> 01:21:45,870
the best rock show I've seen in a
long time. I went to go see, uh,

1295
01:21:47,100 --> 01:21:50,880
uh, what does it them, Crick Crick.
Crooked vultures. So what the fuck?

1296
01:21:50,881 --> 01:21:55,620
I kept calling them crooked buzzards,
them crooked vultures. I went to go see,

1297
01:21:55,621 --> 01:21:58,320
which is, uh, uh, I guess
it's, that's super group.

1298
01:21:59,170 --> 01:22:02,940
It's got John Paul Jones
from led Zeppelin, uh,

1299
01:22:02,970 --> 01:22:04,860
David Grohl on drums.

1300
01:22:05,490 --> 01:22:08,250
And I don't know how to say the lead
singer's name cause I never heard anybody

1301
01:22:08,251 --> 01:22:12,420
say as a Josh Hommie from Queens of the
Stone Age and eagles of death metal.

1302
01:22:12,690 --> 01:22:17,130
I've been listening to all those bands
for years just because, uh, you know,

1303
01:22:17,131 --> 01:22:20,130
I've been a big fan of Dave girls drama
and so whenever he would go, you know,

1304
01:22:20,131 --> 01:22:22,740
do like killing joke or he'd
be in Queens of the Stone Age,

1305
01:22:22,741 --> 01:22:26,680
I got into those guys. So anyways,
I went to go see this show, um,

1306
01:22:26,690 --> 01:22:29,670
and I bought their new album.
They were actually selling it on vinyl,

1307
01:22:29,671 --> 01:22:33,930
so I had to get it so I could seem
cool and my next party and if you get a

1308
01:22:33,931 --> 01:22:38,280
chance, um, I mean their
whole album is up on youtube,

1309
01:22:38,281 --> 01:22:40,890
so listen to it. If you
like it, don't be a comment.

1310
01:22:41,040 --> 01:22:44,700
Go out and go buy it and then go see them
on tour. Man, they will fucking unreal.

1311
01:22:44,910 --> 01:22:48,990
And Dave Grohl might be the best live
rock drummer I've ever seen. The Guy,

1312
01:22:49,230 --> 01:22:53,400
he's just, he's fucking unreal.
The guy was the shit. And uh,

1313
01:22:54,930 --> 01:22:58,140
I dunno man. I felt like I was like a
fucking kid watching that were, you know,

1314
01:22:58,141 --> 01:23:00,960
even when you watch a great band and you
just wish you were up there doing it,

1315
01:23:00,961 --> 01:23:02,220
and then as you're driving home,

1316
01:23:02,490 --> 01:23:05,410
you start thinking of all the cool stuff
that happened and then you're actually

1317
01:23:05,411 --> 01:23:06,130
fantasizing

1318
01:23:06,130 --> 01:23:09,310
that it was you that did it. Like
that's how fucking good the, uh,

1319
01:23:10,120 --> 01:23:13,910
that's how I was just fucking
awesome. They're just a
fucking killer band. And, uh,

1320
01:23:14,230 --> 01:23:17,650
that's all I've been doing is listening
to this shit. So, uh, if you get a chance,

1321
01:23:17,651 --> 01:23:19,030
definitely go check those guys out.

1322
01:23:19,031 --> 01:23:20,500
Or if you want to see
the show that I went to,

1323
01:23:20,501 --> 01:23:25,300
what's already up on fucking youtube
because people record everything. Um,

1324
01:23:26,510 --> 01:23:31,460
just search, um, them crooked
vultures will turn w I l,

1325
01:23:31,461 --> 01:23:35,030
T, e, r, n and then Los Angeles,
and you'll get to see the fucking

1326
01:23:36,770 --> 01:23:39,170
show. I saw, you know, I haven't,
I've been fucking sitting here.

1327
01:23:39,220 --> 01:23:43,490
I've got the Goddamn game on mute here.
Who's winning?

1328
01:23:44,060 --> 01:23:45,140
Is it still one to one?

1329
01:23:46,790 --> 01:23:47,623
Okay.

1330
01:23:51,700 --> 01:23:56,180
Am I allowed to do that or am I on some
sort of copyright infringement here? Oh,

1331
01:23:56,181 --> 01:23:57,500
it's one to one.
The third period.

1332
01:23:59,460 --> 01:24:03,420
Buffalo's got a fucking great
goaltender, sons of bitches. You know,

1333
01:24:03,421 --> 01:24:07,650
something I wouldn't mind seeing
buffalo when it poor bastards. You know,

1334
01:24:07,890 --> 01:24:12,250
you got fucked in 99.
What else did you go to the finals?

1335
01:24:12,330 --> 01:24:15,760
Did you go to the finals in the 70s?
Was that Saint Louis?

1336
01:24:16,430 --> 01:24:19,420
Do you lose to the flyers? I don't
fucking know. No one gives a shit bill.

1337
01:24:19,760 --> 01:24:24,520
All right, let's plow ahead here. Uh,
last week I did the answer to the, uh,

1338
01:24:24,640 --> 01:24:26,830
the women thing.
Why is it never enough?

1339
01:24:27,970 --> 01:24:32,970
And that created an absolute shit storm
and a of basically misogynistic trashing

1340
01:24:34,151 --> 01:24:38,410
of women. So let's continue
it. No, I'm kidding.

1341
01:24:38,650 --> 01:24:42,130
We're going to try to balance it
out here. I actually, I took one,

1342
01:24:43,180 --> 01:24:46,960
two comments from women,
one supporting what was said last week,

1343
01:24:46,961 --> 01:24:49,780
and another one who just really brought
up the point that should have been made

1344
01:24:49,781 --> 01:24:53,740
from the beginning. So let me read the
first one. All right. Uh, first off,

1345
01:24:53,741 --> 01:24:56,460
bill loved the podcast,
especially this week's,

1346
01:24:56,690 --> 01:24:59,920
I've rarely heard someone so succinctly
describe what is wrong with the

1347
01:24:59,921 --> 01:25:04,480
predominant attitudes of
women. Even men today. Um,

1348
01:25:04,510 --> 01:25:07,900
you know what most women really
want from men? It's not material,

1349
01:25:07,930 --> 01:25:11,320
nor is it being spontaneous.
It runs deeper than that.

1350
01:25:12,340 --> 01:25:16,540
Women want sacrifice that I read this
last week. I can't fucking remember.

1351
01:25:16,541 --> 01:25:21,460
Maybe I did. I'm losing my
mind. Women, one sacrifice.
Most women will tell you, uh,

1352
01:25:21,700 --> 01:25:25,480
your dreams are selfish if
they don't revolve around them.

1353
01:25:25,481 --> 01:25:29,320
And that real love is
compromise and commitment. Uh,

1354
01:25:29,321 --> 01:25:34,020
they want you to drop. I'm just trying
to remember, did I had already read this?

1355
01:25:34,900 --> 01:25:37,660
Ah, fuck it. I'm going to plow ahead. They
want you to drop your hopes and dreams.

1356
01:25:37,661 --> 01:25:39,550
They want to see the moment you give up.

1357
01:25:39,551 --> 01:25:43,510
I emphasize that because once that moment
has passed and you have nothing left

1358
01:25:43,511 --> 01:25:44,291
to sacrifice,

1359
01:25:44,291 --> 01:25:48,610
you become that 30 to 40 year old loser
that they will leave to the guy who

1360
01:25:48,611 --> 01:25:49,990
asked,
why is it never enough?

1361
01:25:50,170 --> 01:25:53,140
It isn't until you've given up
everything that is important to you.

1362
01:25:53,380 --> 01:25:57,190
This is what love is for most women.
It's not even that they are selfish,

1363
01:25:57,191 --> 01:26:01,390
but proposed precisely the opposite.
It's the complete other lack of self.

1364
01:26:01,420 --> 01:26:02,830
I think I already read this,
didn't I?

1365
01:26:03,230 --> 01:26:08,230
The nature of love is not that of a host
and a parasite love is only possible

1366
01:26:08,751 --> 01:26:13,190
between two complete or independent
individuals who do not require sacrifice

1367
01:26:13,191 --> 01:26:17,420
from one another. Real selfish people do
not need approval or love from others.

1368
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:21,110
They simply would not give a fuck.
I don't know if I agree with that.

1369
01:26:21,350 --> 01:26:26,350
What you're basically saying is you need
a significant part of your life that

1370
01:26:26,480 --> 01:26:28,520
you,
it's not two overlapping circles.

1371
01:26:28,521 --> 01:26:31,190
It's two intersecting circles
is basically what it is.

1372
01:26:31,790 --> 01:26:35,600
So where you intersect is your lives
together and where you're not is your own

1373
01:26:35,601 --> 01:26:38,810
fucking life that you're allowed to lead.
Um,

1374
01:26:40,160 --> 01:26:42,860
sign out. That was a bunch
of generalizations, but
that's what we do here.

1375
01:26:42,861 --> 01:26:46,010
But this, this lady here just basically
sums up the whole thing. She says,

1376
01:26:46,011 --> 01:26:46,890
Bill late,

1377
01:26:46,891 --> 01:26:50,090
you've been talking about men who have
been doing all these nice things for

1378
01:26:50,091 --> 01:26:53,540
women and the women have been complaining
about it like selfish [inaudible].

1379
01:26:53,900 --> 01:26:55,220
My response is this,

1380
01:26:55,430 --> 01:26:59,330
men need to stop allowing women to get
away with anything they fucking want.

1381
01:26:59,570 --> 01:27:04,370
Seriously as the pursuit of pussy turn
men into, um, all men into whiny bitches.

1382
01:27:04,670 --> 01:27:07,970
All these guys have been whining about
the way these girls react when they do

1383
01:27:07,971 --> 01:27:10,340
something they think is nice.

1384
01:27:10,550 --> 01:27:14,840
What these guys really need to do is
stand up for themselves and tell these

1385
01:27:14,841 --> 01:27:19,490
chicks they have two options. Say thank
you or I don't get number two. It says,

1386
01:27:19,491 --> 01:27:23,180
try to be nice and let them
and let him complain about it.

1387
01:27:23,900 --> 01:27:25,330
I don't know what that means.
Um,

1388
01:27:25,340 --> 01:27:29,930
these guys are writing to you instead
of confronting these women so the women

1389
01:27:29,931 --> 01:27:32,780
aren't even aware that their
behavior needs to change.

1390
01:27:32,781 --> 01:27:34,760
They are only making it worse.
Exactly.

1391
01:27:35,420 --> 01:27:37,400
That's really the truth
of all of this shit.

1392
01:27:37,650 --> 01:27:38,483
You know?

1393
01:27:39,580 --> 01:27:44,360
I mean, I actually ran into the guy when
I was in Tempe who wrote that, uh, that,

1394
01:27:44,480 --> 01:27:47,050
that letter of why isn't it enough?
I met his girl,

1395
01:27:47,051 --> 01:27:49,330
she was a sweetheart and everything.
It's just kind of a,

1396
01:27:50,440 --> 01:27:52,780
it just was a great question to ask.

1397
01:27:52,781 --> 01:27:57,190
That set off a lot of fucking
frustration and a, yeah,

1398
01:27:57,760 --> 01:28:01,780
what do the reality is, is what this
woman wrote here. Is that 100% true?

1399
01:28:01,840 --> 01:28:06,840
Is that you really shouldn't be
writing me bitching about it.

1400
01:28:07,101 --> 01:28:10,550
You should be talking to you woman.
But you know, some of it is, you know,

1401
01:28:10,551 --> 01:28:14,240
people just want to vent and then there's
other times people are there in fucked

1402
01:28:14,241 --> 01:28:18,920
up situations and by fucked up situations,
I mean they're married.

1403
01:28:19,670 --> 01:28:20,680
So,
um,

1404
01:28:20,690 --> 01:28:24,860
I think what a lot of guys learned quickly
is when they get married is now that

1405
01:28:24,940 --> 01:28:28,250
they are legally bound to someone
and if they break up with them,

1406
01:28:28,251 --> 01:28:31,550
they lose half their shit.
It becomes,

1407
01:28:32,240 --> 01:28:34,790
it's not a balanced situation,

1408
01:28:35,910 --> 01:28:36,743
you know,

1409
01:28:38,340 --> 01:28:40,980
if it, why should, I shouldn't
just just put that on guys,

1410
01:28:40,981 --> 01:28:42,330
but it's whoever has more,

1411
01:28:42,331 --> 01:28:46,320
whoever brought more into the relationship
when you get married you fucked

1412
01:28:47,220 --> 01:28:51,450
because you stand to lose more,
which weakens your arguing position,

1413
01:28:52,110 --> 01:28:56,820
which you have to do is get to that zen
place where you don't give a fuck about

1414
01:28:56,821 --> 01:28:58,110
materialistic goods.

1415
01:28:58,170 --> 01:29:01,740
And then you can really go off on whoever
the fuck you are with. But reality is,

1416
01:29:01,741 --> 01:29:04,560
you know, same thing, like when you
see like, you know, the big thing,

1417
01:29:04,561 --> 01:29:06,080
when I first started doing comedies,
I used,

1418
01:29:06,170 --> 01:29:09,540
so we see female comics would go on
stage and they'd be joking about how guys

1419
01:29:09,780 --> 01:29:13,500
don't know what they're doing in
bed. They'd be like, oh my God,

1420
01:29:13,501 --> 01:29:17,820
they have no idea where it is or what
to do. But Baba Baba Baba, you know,

1421
01:29:17,821 --> 01:29:22,320
which I understand the frustration
of that, but it's like, so, you know,

1422
01:29:23,100 --> 01:29:27,570
I'll wait. Sam Kinison did the bit,
just tell us, tell us what to do,

1423
01:29:27,760 --> 01:29:31,410
we'll fucking do it. Um, I think
that's what a lot of complaining is.

1424
01:29:31,411 --> 01:29:33,060
God knows a lot of my complaining is,
well,

1425
01:29:33,061 --> 01:29:36,450
why don't you just walk up to the person
or thing that you're bitching about and

1426
01:29:36,451 --> 01:29:41,451
tell him how you feel and just take
out all the fucks in the insulting the,

1427
01:29:42,120 --> 01:29:45,360
the insults. I Dunno, you know,

1428
01:29:45,361 --> 01:29:48,750
at this podcast fucking sucks.
I'm going to call it out before you guys.

1429
01:29:48,751 --> 01:29:51,600
This is podcast is just sucked this week.
All right.

1430
01:29:52,380 --> 01:29:54,750
I'm all over the fucking place.
I'm fucking exhausted.

1431
01:29:54,751 --> 01:29:56,130
It's a Goddamn holiday weekend.

1432
01:29:56,131 --> 01:29:58,380
You can you guys [inaudible] how
hard are you working this week?

1433
01:29:58,870 --> 01:30:00,440
You know,
has it?

1434
01:30:00,710 --> 01:30:04,670
Somebody's gonna come in and brought a
pie in and somebody is wearing an awful

1435
01:30:04,671 --> 01:30:08,210
brown and orange Thanksgiving sweater.
You know,

1436
01:30:08,211 --> 01:30:12,200
maybe it's your manager to show
that he has a human side. You know?

1437
01:30:12,201 --> 01:30:13,970
Isn't that the worst when
you hate your fucking boss?

1438
01:30:13,971 --> 01:30:15,050
And then around the holidays,

1439
01:30:15,051 --> 01:30:19,070
all of a sudden he just lets up a little
bit and tries to act nice, you know,

1440
01:30:19,850 --> 01:30:22,310
or it's a female. She gets a
little bit nicer, you know,

1441
01:30:22,880 --> 01:30:25,190
and the whole time she's sitting there
wishing you a happy thanksgiving,

1442
01:30:25,191 --> 01:30:29,600
you just want to fucking kick
her right in the box, you know?

1443
01:30:29,601 --> 01:30:31,790
But you can't,
you fucking can't.

1444
01:30:35,390 --> 01:30:38,450
Well, that was sad. What the fuck is it?

1445
01:30:38,451 --> 01:30:42,050
It's one to one 1515 minutes left
in the third period. You know,

1446
01:30:42,051 --> 01:30:42,861
one of the hardest things to do,

1447
01:30:42,861 --> 01:30:45,440
I think is to be announced or for hockey
now that they took and taken out the

1448
01:30:45,441 --> 01:30:46,910
red line,
the fucking game.

1449
01:30:48,710 --> 01:30:50,540
You break your neck sitting
there watching the fucking game.

1450
01:30:50,541 --> 01:30:53,360
That's why I like it and watching it on
TV is cause I don't have to keep turning

1451
01:30:53,361 --> 01:30:57,590
my head. The camera, the camera
moves for me. It does all the work.

1452
01:30:58,370 --> 01:31:01,190
What I'm literally out of
Shit to say they don't.

1453
01:31:01,191 --> 01:31:04,910
I feel like right now this how bad this
podcast is when you bomb is a comedian

1454
01:31:05,060 --> 01:31:07,730
is that works. When, when,
when shit is going great,

1455
01:31:07,760 --> 01:31:11,270
when everything you say is killing,
when you're on stage,

1456
01:31:11,690 --> 01:31:13,250
basically what happens is,

1457
01:31:13,310 --> 01:31:17,930
is you've done about 20
minutes of material and you
look down at your watch and

1458
01:31:17,931 --> 01:31:20,360
your watch says you've been
up there for 55 minutes.

1459
01:31:20,660 --> 01:31:24,080
That's when you know that you're
fucking killing. And conversely,

1460
01:31:24,530 --> 01:31:25,610
when you're bombing,

1461
01:31:25,640 --> 01:31:30,640
you will do an hour's worth of material
in 17 minutes and all you have left is

1462
01:31:31,341 --> 01:31:32,270
your closing bit.

1463
01:31:32,300 --> 01:31:35,330
And you look down at your watch and you
realize that you've been on stage for

1464
01:31:35,331 --> 01:31:39,980
just under 20 minutes and you're like,
wow, now what the fuck am I doing?

1465
01:31:39,981 --> 01:31:44,630
You know your mouth gets dry. That's
when you start going into the crowd.

1466
01:31:45,410 --> 01:31:49,100
Hey, you know, so what's there
to do around here in Raleigh,

1467
01:31:49,640 --> 01:31:53,440
North Carolina. Huh? Look
at this guy over here, Huh?

1468
01:31:54,080 --> 01:31:59,080
What do you do sir? Oh,
you're a plumber. Really? Uh,

1469
01:31:59,680 --> 01:32:03,550
a, I bet your butt crack is
always shut. Fucking kill me.

1470
01:32:04,330 --> 01:32:07,360
You know, you just, you just fucked. Hey,

1471
01:32:07,361 --> 01:32:11,350
how about a round of applause for the wait
staff, you know, keep it going for him.

1472
01:32:11,351 --> 01:32:13,840
You know, and I just want to thank
all you guys were showing up.

1473
01:32:13,840 --> 01:32:18,190
I know it's a recession. I
appreciate, uh, you know,

1474
01:32:18,191 --> 01:32:21,720
how about I am for the
tropes, you know, you know,

1475
01:32:21,820 --> 01:32:23,530
whether you support going to war or not,
you know,

1476
01:32:23,531 --> 01:32:27,250
these kids are out there that laying
down their lives and they're away from

1477
01:32:27,251 --> 01:32:29,230
their families in thanksgivings this week.

1478
01:32:29,231 --> 01:32:34,231
I think we should all sit back and give
thanks and be appreciative that I've

1479
01:32:34,391 --> 01:32:37,320
already done an hours worth of fucking
jokes and you cons haven't laughed in

1480
01:32:37,321 --> 01:32:40,890
anything.
So now I'm technically in overtime,

1481
01:32:40,900 --> 01:32:42,940
even though contractually I already,

1482
01:32:42,970 --> 01:32:47,620
I owe you like another 40 minutes
of fucking comedy, you know,

1483
01:32:48,280 --> 01:32:52,780
and let's not forget all the people who
have died in boating accidents this year.

1484
01:32:53,490 --> 01:32:53,860
You know,

1485
01:32:53,860 --> 01:32:56,680
a lot of people don't know that boating
accidents is one of the leading,

1486
01:32:56,710 --> 01:33:00,190
leading causes of death.
When human beings are out in the ocean

1487
01:33:04,360 --> 01:33:08,410
and you start remembering jokes from
the early part of your act and you start

1488
01:33:08,411 --> 01:33:13,300
telling him, you know, yeah, they
did a study the other day. They said,

1489
01:33:13,301 --> 01:33:17,440
you know, 90% of shark attacks
actually happen in shallow water.

1490
01:33:18,280 --> 01:33:22,540
No Shit. That's where the people are.
It's called the fucking beach. Oh,

1491
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:27,890
what are their people swimming to Europe?
Let's go to France. You pussies. Ah,

1492
01:33:27,940 --> 01:33:31,510
you like that joke?
That's a joke for my act in 2001.

1493
01:33:31,511 --> 01:33:35,950
I'm too fucking old jokes on my act
on us than I used to fucking do.

1494
01:33:37,540 --> 01:33:40,880
All right? He didn't want to like my
original jokes. You guys see these uh,

1495
01:33:41,430 --> 01:33:46,260
rap group? Criss Cross one went up. Chris
warm it up. Chris. Hey, go to bed. Chris.

1496
01:33:46,261 --> 01:33:49,200
What do you like? Nine years old. Oh.

1497
01:33:53,310 --> 01:33:55,170
Oh my God.
I had horrible jokes.

1498
01:33:56,240 --> 01:34:00,240
He's do jokes about working in a dental
office. A people, I got news for you.

1499
01:34:00,960 --> 01:34:05,550
Six years. Neglect is not cured by
a tic tac in the waiting room. Hey.

1500
01:34:06,320 --> 01:34:09,840
Huh? You guys ready for
your next stack? Too Bad.

1501
01:34:09,870 --> 01:34:12,030
I still got another 30 minutes to do.

1502
01:34:13,800 --> 01:34:14,630
Yeah,

1503
01:34:14,630 --> 01:34:18,080
ladies back me up. Uh,
guys are crazy, right?

1504
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:23,230
I mean, you know, where are we? We,

1505
01:34:23,231 --> 01:34:28,231
we don't give a shit that's gonna be
just searching for shit to say what,

1506
01:34:29,600 --> 01:34:33,290
but I mean it's, it's great to be
here in Raleigh. You know what I mean?

1507
01:34:35,120 --> 01:34:38,080
It's guy, you know, you come out
here to Raleigh, you know they got a,

1508
01:34:39,180 --> 01:34:43,810
they got a mall. All right folks, I'm
not gonna lie to you. I'm out of jokes.

1509
01:34:44,020 --> 01:34:46,380
I wish you could just do that and
just fucking become honest. I'm,

1510
01:34:46,420 --> 01:34:49,030
I'm out of fucking material. I don't
know what the fuck you guys want from me.

1511
01:34:49,740 --> 01:34:52,930
Come on. Tic, tic, tic, tic, tic,
tic, tic, tic. All right, 41 minutes.

1512
01:34:53,020 --> 01:34:56,110
Does that qualify as a podcast?
Oh, I actually, you know,

1513
01:34:56,111 --> 01:34:58,040
I forgot one story was
supposed to be here. I think

1514
01:34:58,040 --> 01:35:02,750
I got one other question. It's a
Phillips some time as I scroll down,

1515
01:35:03,230 --> 01:35:06,200
what's up with scrolling is a little,

1516
01:35:06,201 --> 01:35:09,300
when you're willing to do a fucking
piece of paper with some old Rodeo all.

1517
01:35:09,650 --> 01:35:10,760
Alright, unacceptable. Here you go.

1518
01:35:10,880 --> 01:35:13,880
Here's a classic example where somebody
should just have used the phrase

1519
01:35:14,180 --> 01:35:17,330
unacceptable and I really want to
go into this bar with this guy went,

1520
01:35:17,790 --> 01:35:21,650
this is a classic fuck over. Um, so bill,

1521
01:35:21,651 --> 01:35:25,820
I show up to this local sports bar at
11:00 PM the night before my birthday by

1522
01:35:25,821 --> 01:35:28,880
myself. While do, that's
your fucking fault, you know?

1523
01:35:30,230 --> 01:35:30,590
Yeah.

1524
01:35:30,590 --> 01:35:31,850
I don't know what your problem is.

1525
01:35:32,210 --> 01:35:34,820
Stop lashing out at the people
around you right now. Look at me.

1526
01:35:34,821 --> 01:35:37,790
I'm taking it out on you because I'm on
a material here and whatever the fuck it

1527
01:35:37,791 --> 01:35:41,030
is, I've lost my stream of consciousness.
Still one to one by the way,

1528
01:35:41,240 --> 01:35:46,000
with 12 minutes and 32 seconds to go.
Hey,

1529
01:35:46,010 --> 01:35:49,220
if anybody knows the name of the announcer
for the, uh, the Sabers, I'd love,

1530
01:35:49,250 --> 01:35:51,860
I'd love to know the guy's name.
I mean, I guess I could Google it,

1531
01:35:51,861 --> 01:35:55,340
but I know when I do, there's going
to be like fucking 58, you know,

1532
01:35:55,341 --> 01:35:58,970
buffalo sabers.net backslash org and
I don't want to go through that shit.

1533
01:35:59,520 --> 01:36:00,820
All right. So anyways, built, uh,

1534
01:36:00,821 --> 01:36:04,700
I show up to a local sports bar at
11:00 PM the night before my birthday by

1535
01:36:04,701 --> 01:36:08,780
myself. All right. He goes, the bartender
asked for my id, I give it to her,

1536
01:36:08,781 --> 01:36:11,060
she hands it back and
asked me what I would like.

1537
01:36:11,450 --> 01:36:14,570
Now I'm not looking for comments,
but you would,

1538
01:36:15,110 --> 01:36:19,130
you would think the bartender would be
aware of the date and time and have some

1539
01:36:19,131 --> 01:36:23,240
snide remark about hanging out by myself.

1540
01:36:25,010 --> 01:36:27,660
Um,
this close to my birthday.

1541
01:36:28,190 --> 01:36:29,023
Yeah.

1542
01:36:29,230 --> 01:36:30,520
Well,
I think she's just trying to see,

1543
01:36:30,521 --> 01:36:33,160
or he's trying to see if you're of age
and not, right. I don't fucking know.

1544
01:36:33,161 --> 01:36:38,130
Anyways. Uh, I'm not upset.
I'm just expecting a stupid
comment. So I ask her, uh,

1545
01:36:38,230 --> 01:36:39,340
what the specials are.

1546
01:36:39,490 --> 01:36:43,690
She tells me that the large
domestics are three bucks and well,

1547
01:36:43,691 --> 01:36:47,830
drinks are two bucks. I see they have
blue moon on tap. I'm not a huge fan,

1548
01:36:48,130 --> 01:36:51,610
but it's 22 ounces of beer for
three bucks. I'll suck it up.

1549
01:36:52,720 --> 01:36:56,260
I order. She says, okay, and serves
it. Fast forward to the bill,

1550
01:36:56,500 --> 01:37:01,500
it seems a tad high and I
see I was charged for 50
for each of the three beers.

1551
01:37:01,930 --> 01:37:03,970
I ask about the bill and she said,
oh,

1552
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:08,680
only domestics are $3 my reply
was blue moon is a domestic beer.

1553
01:37:08,830 --> 01:37:11,170
It's made in America and she says,

1554
01:37:11,171 --> 01:37:15,280
no domestics or Bud Miller and cores.
Now wait a minute.

1555
01:37:15,281 --> 01:37:17,950
I thought Blue Moon wasn't
that made in fucking Belgium.

1556
01:37:19,240 --> 01:37:22,390
Now I've got to fucking look it up before
I take your side here because I really

1557
01:37:22,391 --> 01:37:26,290
want to be blue moon.
All right,

1558
01:37:26,680 --> 01:37:30,610
Blue Moon brewing company. All right,
here we go. Let's see what we got here.

1559
01:37:32,520 --> 01:37:37,410
Oh Jesus Christ. It's a whole
fucking website isn't blue moon.

1560
01:37:37,440 --> 01:37:41,690
It's not a Belgian beer date of birth.
Enter.

1561
01:37:43,320 --> 01:37:46,710
I have to give you a valid date
of birth to read about beer.

1562
01:37:46,800 --> 01:37:49,770
Are you fucking kidding me? All
right, let's go to Wikipedia.

1563
01:37:49,800 --> 01:37:51,300
God knows that's fucking accurate,
right?

1564
01:37:52,290 --> 01:37:56,820
A blue moon is a full moon. That's
not what I want. Blue Moon bear.

1565
01:37:57,000 --> 01:38:00,750
You're fucking, no one gives a
shit about space. Actually, I do.

1566
01:38:00,810 --> 01:38:05,640
My brother's really in this space
and I learned the other day I thought

1567
01:38:05,641 --> 01:38:08,190
something was the north star. He's
like, that's not in the north star.

1568
01:38:08,190 --> 01:38:11,370
That's Jupiter. How you'll get the fuck
out of here? He goes, yeah. First of all,

1569
01:38:11,880 --> 01:38:15,150
he goes, stars, twinkle
planets reflect light.

1570
01:38:16,230 --> 01:38:18,580
So ever since then I've been
looking up at the sky and go,

1571
01:38:18,700 --> 01:38:19,830
and that's a fucking planet.

1572
01:38:20,190 --> 01:38:23,400
I want to know what that is and
I want to go buy a telescope.

1573
01:38:23,430 --> 01:38:26,730
But there's no way to buy telescope
without looking like a fucking pervert.

1574
01:38:26,940 --> 01:38:27,773
You know what I mean?

1575
01:38:27,900 --> 01:38:32,040
That's yet another thing that perverts
who fucking ruin the same way gay guys

1576
01:38:32,041 --> 01:38:36,630
have ruined cowboy boots, cowboy hats,
and foo man shoes. You can't fucking,

1577
01:38:36,631 --> 01:38:37,464
you know,

1578
01:38:38,250 --> 01:38:43,250
you can't wear any of that shit unless
you're on a fucking ranch rustling of

1579
01:38:43,261 --> 01:38:47,550
fucking cow to the Goddamn ground or else
people think you're out there blowing

1580
01:38:47,590 --> 01:38:52,160
someone. Um, all right. Blue
Moon Beer. Let's see here.

1581
01:38:54,430 --> 01:38:58,300
Blue Moon beer is Molson
Coors brewing company.

1582
01:38:59,990 --> 01:39:02,050
All right, so the is fucking right. Good.

1583
01:39:02,080 --> 01:39:04,150
Now I can side with you because
I really want to go off on this.

1584
01:39:04,151 --> 01:39:06,640
So the fucking dude is ordering
a domestic beer and she goes,

1585
01:39:06,780 --> 01:39:10,300
no domestics or Bud Miller
and cores. Two things. First,

1586
01:39:10,480 --> 01:39:14,680
why couldn't she mentioned that Blue Moon
is not considered a domestic beer when

1587
01:39:14,681 --> 01:39:18,760
I ordered, but second, let's look at
the bigger picture. I'm sure bill,

1588
01:39:18,940 --> 01:39:22,420
you've run into this. You're told
domestics are on sale for happy hour.

1589
01:39:22,421 --> 01:39:23,770
So you order a Sam Adams.

1590
01:39:23,771 --> 01:39:27,670
At which point you told Sam Adams
isn't considered a domestic beer. Well,

1591
01:39:27,671 --> 01:39:30,940
actually, um, you may have thought, yes.

1592
01:39:30,941 --> 01:39:32,980
Sam Adams is a domestic beer.

1593
01:39:33,190 --> 01:39:37,090
It was made by the blood of the
American patriots. He had dumb cunt.

1594
01:39:37,510 --> 01:39:40,000
I like this guy. Uh,
who made the decision?

1595
01:39:40,020 --> 01:39:43,120
Who made the decision to call
Shitty Beers? Domestic beer.

1596
01:39:43,270 --> 01:39:47,800
What kind of a euphemism is that?
Whenever this happens in the future,

1597
01:39:47,920 --> 01:39:51,430
I'm going to ask for a manager and tell
them that not including all domestic

1598
01:39:51,431 --> 01:39:54,490
beers with their domestic
specials is unacceptable. Dude,

1599
01:39:54,491 --> 01:39:57,880
you should us fucking said that unless
this is actually made in a different

1600
01:39:57,881 --> 01:40:01,510
company. A country in Molson
Coors brewing just bought it.

1601
01:40:02,110 --> 01:40:03,280
You guys want to hear about it?

1602
01:40:03,730 --> 01:40:08,730
Blue Moon is a Belgian style wheat beer
brewed by the Molson brewing company in

1603
01:40:08,801 --> 01:40:09,970
Golden,
Colorado.

1604
01:40:10,510 --> 01:40:15,510
It's a fucking domestic beer was launched
in 1995 in Canada is marketed as a

1605
01:40:16,961 --> 01:40:20,170
similar beer called Rickard's white.

1606
01:40:20,830 --> 01:40:25,830
Why do they not have blue moon's up there
is blue moon offensive and it's brewed

1607
01:40:27,101 --> 01:40:31,840
in Montreal, Quebec. All right, so some
of it is brewed in another country.

1608
01:40:31,841 --> 01:40:36,790
Is that they're out? Well then it should
be called Rickard's white, right dude,

1609
01:40:36,850 --> 01:40:39,030
bottom line is you got fucked.
Yeah.

1610
01:40:39,170 --> 01:40:44,170
So they should say our are cheap ass beers
are a r three bucks and anything with

1611
01:40:44,261 --> 01:40:48,190
any sort of hops and flavor in it
is going to be for 50. There you go.

1612
01:40:48,250 --> 01:40:51,970
That's the big outrage of the week.
The student fucked. Um, all right.

1613
01:40:52,090 --> 01:40:54,160
That's the end of my lackluster one.
You know what I mean?

1614
01:40:55,600 --> 01:40:58,330
What the fuck do you guys want from me?
I do one of these every fucking week.

1615
01:40:58,331 --> 01:41:02,050
I'm running out of stories to tell you
I already did that gay guy joke before.

1616
01:41:02,170 --> 01:41:05,140
I've already done the fucking,
I think I need to take a break.

1617
01:41:05,141 --> 01:41:08,350
Just like the foo fighters, you know
when they sold out Wembley Stadium,

1618
01:41:08,530 --> 01:41:11,230
they sold it out twice and
they were sitting around going,

1619
01:41:11,231 --> 01:41:14,190
what the fuck else can we
do? Just like when, uh,

1620
01:41:14,680 --> 01:41:18,310
the Beatles sold out Shea stadium
or the police sold out Shea stadium,

1621
01:41:19,030 --> 01:41:21,820
that's when you just realize, well,
the only way to go now is to go down.

1622
01:41:22,030 --> 01:41:26,830
I think I've begun the backward slide.
I'm sliding down the backside of a,

1623
01:41:28,030 --> 01:41:30,850
of the podcast and I was
actually thinking about that.

1624
01:41:30,851 --> 01:41:35,560
How long am I going to do this
podcast? You know, Oprah's retiring.

1625
01:41:39,820 --> 01:41:42,490
She's calling it quits
after 25 fucking years.

1626
01:41:44,580 --> 01:41:44,901
I mean,

1627
01:41:44,901 --> 01:41:49,010
I've basically done one episode every
week for the past two and a half years,

1628
01:41:49,011 --> 01:41:53,990
or two years. Two months. So 52
weeks a year. That's 104 episodes.

1629
01:41:54,770 --> 01:41:59,750
Plus like another 20 maybe I'm
up to 125 episodes. All right.

1630
01:41:59,990 --> 01:42:01,640
Back in the day,
if you did a sitcom,

1631
01:42:01,641 --> 01:42:04,160
you needed a hundred episodes
to go into syndication.

1632
01:42:04,550 --> 01:42:08,960
I'm in syndication right now. So
think about that shit. I'm like,

1633
01:42:09,200 --> 01:42:13,130
if this was the drew Carey show,
I would be in like the seventh season,

1634
01:42:13,131 --> 01:42:16,460
you know when they've added the
fat chick with the crazy makeup,

1635
01:42:16,640 --> 01:42:19,810
cause we're on a story, ideas, you know?

1636
01:42:19,910 --> 01:42:23,930
So my question to you is how
much longer should I do this?

1637
01:42:23,931 --> 01:42:26,570
When do I bow out gracefully
and come out with a new,

1638
01:42:27,290 --> 01:42:29,300
a new form of a,

1639
01:42:30,710 --> 01:42:34,010
what do they call this
shit on the Internet? Huh?

1640
01:42:34,940 --> 01:42:35,773
Viral.

1641
01:42:37,070 --> 01:42:37,310
Yeah.

1642
01:42:37,310 --> 01:42:39,890
Do I, do I take it to the
next level? I do a video.

1643
01:42:40,430 --> 01:42:44,000
Maybe I'll do a video podcast next and
I'll do like, I'll, I'll have puppets.

1644
01:42:45,180 --> 01:42:47,900
All right, I'll have
the cont puppet, right.

1645
01:42:47,930 --> 01:42:52,190
What'd you just be sort of some twats
shape tortilla with a red lips on it,

1646
01:42:52,220 --> 01:42:55,910
you know, that can talk
and uh, whatever. I'm,

1647
01:42:55,911 --> 01:43:00,320
I'm just sort of brainstorming here
and a fucking no puppets.

1648
01:43:00,321 --> 01:43:02,480
A creepy,
you know,

1649
01:43:02,530 --> 01:43:05,840
you ever go back and watch
Mr. RogersRogers' and
just see how creepy those

1650
01:43:05,841 --> 01:43:09,410
fucking puppets are. You know why? Cause
their mouse didn't move king Friday.

1651
01:43:10,830 --> 01:43:12,870
Hello Lady Mclean.

1652
01:43:15,920 --> 01:43:17,940
My name is much.
Think I'm out of my fucking mind.

1653
01:43:17,950 --> 01:43:20,610
Actually did it in the living
room this week. You know,

1654
01:43:20,611 --> 01:43:22,950
that's why I had the Nice
Carnegie Hall sort of

1655
01:43:25,720 --> 01:43:27,820
Ah, Acoustics in here. Oh my
dog fucking walked out on me.

1656
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:32,500
You don't really think my dog finds me
annoying. You know, I practice my guitar,

1657
01:43:33,130 --> 01:43:34,120
she has a habit of going,

1658
01:43:37,500 --> 01:43:41,860
gives me like a big fucking exhale and
if I'm practicing anything up high,

1659
01:43:41,861 --> 01:43:44,710
like I was trying to learn how to play
the beginning of for those about to rock,

1660
01:43:44,711 --> 01:43:47,620
we salute you,
which is way up on the neck of the guitar.

1661
01:43:48,250 --> 01:43:51,440
And I was trying to play it the way Angus
plays it, which is a combination of uh,

1662
01:43:51,441 --> 01:43:52,160
using a pick

1663
01:43:52,160 --> 01:43:55,100
and plucking with two other fingers.
So needless to say,

1664
01:43:55,550 --> 01:44:00,260
it sounded like somebody was choking
aspera and uh, my dog, you know,

1665
01:44:00,470 --> 01:44:02,750
she sort of got,
you know,

1666
01:44:02,751 --> 01:44:06,860
just lifted her head up and sort of looked
at me and I laughed because I knew I

1667
01:44:06,861 --> 01:44:07,581
was bugging her.

1668
01:44:07,581 --> 01:44:11,690
And then I was so focused on trying to
be able to play this for some stupid

1669
01:44:11,691 --> 01:44:14,410
fucking reason. And, uh,

1670
01:44:14,770 --> 01:44:18,700
when I came out of my fucking comatose
state, I looked and the dog had left.

1671
01:44:19,810 --> 01:44:24,340
So, uh, I don't know what the point of
that was. You know what the point was?

1672
01:44:24,341 --> 01:44:28,540
The point was to somehow get to 50
minutes because if I don't do it for 50

1673
01:44:28,541 --> 01:44:33,460
minutes, then I can't continue
to, to not get paid for this. Um,

1674
01:44:33,461 --> 01:44:36,640
what type my website? Uh,
Bill bird.com. Um, once again,

1675
01:44:36,641 --> 01:44:40,390
go there and a fucking,
I don't know,

1676
01:44:40,750 --> 01:44:44,770
go to my show in Cleveland or go to my
show at Sacramento. Those in, in a, in a,

1677
01:44:44,771 --> 01:44:46,030
the punchline is Sacramento.

1678
01:44:46,031 --> 01:44:51,031
There's the next two weeks I have coming
up and a or c'mon out and watch my live

1679
01:44:51,131 --> 01:44:53,560
taping. Oh, somebody asked me
a question and they're like,

1680
01:44:53,770 --> 01:44:56,350
which one of the two shows
are being taped that night?

1681
01:44:56,530 --> 01:44:59,110
Are both of them being taped?
And if you take both,

1682
01:44:59,260 --> 01:45:03,190
will you combine both and
make one special? Yes,

1683
01:45:04,490 --> 01:45:06,080
yes I will.
That's what happens.

1684
01:45:06,081 --> 01:45:09,980
You take both of them and if I just have
one set that's just fucking awesome and

1685
01:45:09,981 --> 01:45:12,500
I loved it. Wire to wire, which
I hope is going to happen,

1686
01:45:12,501 --> 01:45:15,620
I'll just take that cause I'm,
I'm really big into a,

1687
01:45:17,170 --> 01:45:20,770
you know, not creating a
performance that didn't happen. Um,

1688
01:45:20,800 --> 01:45:25,300
my CD is all one show. Why
do I do this? We only did,

1689
01:45:25,301 --> 01:45:29,890
we only taped one show, so that's
all one show. Um, my HBO special,

1690
01:45:29,891 --> 01:45:30,724
we did too.

1691
01:45:32,080 --> 01:45:35,800
And I forget which one joke is from the
first show and the rest was all from the

1692
01:45:35,801 --> 01:45:36,490
second show.

1693
01:45:36,490 --> 01:45:41,490
It's so it's basically
one performance and um,

1694
01:45:43,330 --> 01:45:46,480
yeah, so that's what I'm hoping for.
So yes, if you're wondering, yes,

1695
01:45:46,780 --> 01:45:50,260
both shows will be taped and um,

1696
01:45:50,860 --> 01:45:52,300
this is what you basically hope for.

1697
01:45:52,301 --> 01:45:55,270
What you do is you go out and you
fucking rock on the first one. See like,

1698
01:45:55,350 --> 01:45:55,571
all right,

1699
01:45:55,571 --> 01:46:00,130
I got a great special already and then
you can just totally relax and fuck

1700
01:46:00,131 --> 01:46:03,170
around on the second one. You
know, kind of the way you,

1701
01:46:03,380 --> 01:46:05,500
you get into like your head,
like you just in a club rather than,

1702
01:46:05,501 --> 01:46:08,800
than doing a special, that's
where you want to be. Um,

1703
01:46:08,890 --> 01:46:11,290
and that's what I want to try
to hope to do. So that said,

1704
01:46:11,291 --> 01:46:14,950
I need to rest my voice. I hope
everybody has a wonderful thanksgiving.

1705
01:46:15,340 --> 01:46:19,270
I would've played a Thanksgiving
song on my guitar, but, uh,

1706
01:46:19,330 --> 01:46:22,540
none of them exist.
There aren't any thanksgiving songs.

1707
01:46:23,020 --> 01:46:25,320
And I'd like saying Shit like
that cause there's always be,

1708
01:46:25,550 --> 01:46:30,550
actually there is one d Lawrence Welk
orchestra did and nobody gives a fuck.

1709
01:46:30,850 --> 01:46:31,683
There's none.
There's no

1710
01:46:32,110 --> 01:46:36,280
names. Is there a famous
one? You know what,

1711
01:46:36,850 --> 01:46:38,410
this is the last thing I'm
going to Google this week.

1712
01:46:38,411 --> 01:46:40,690
Let me see if I can find a
fucking thanksgiving song.

1713
01:46:42,070 --> 01:46:45,010
Do you know we used to do for
Thanksgiving, me and my family, we, uh,

1714
01:46:45,910 --> 01:46:49,860
or the family that I was part of,
it really wasn't my family. Um,

1715
01:46:51,230 --> 01:46:52,700
we used to fucking,
we used to,

1716
01:46:52,730 --> 01:46:55,490
we decided we were going to play
football one year and became a tradition.

1717
01:46:55,491 --> 01:46:57,890
We would play football and it was great.

1718
01:46:57,891 --> 01:47:02,891
It divided the family in half and it would
always be sleeting and raining and uh

1719
01:47:03,830 --> 01:47:08,630
, we would end up getting
into huge fights. Like, fuck
you, fuck you fist fights.

1720
01:47:09,320 --> 01:47:12,380
And uh, it was really bizarre.
And then we'd sit down,

1721
01:47:12,381 --> 01:47:17,240
we'd all be fucking soaking
wet, you know, grass stains and

1722
01:47:18,560 --> 01:47:19,393
uh,

1723
01:47:19,660 --> 01:47:23,560
but the food was great. You know,
still one of my favorite days.

1724
01:47:24,280 --> 01:47:28,640
Thanksgiving
music.

1725
01:47:31,700 --> 01:47:32,660
Get the fuck Outta here.

1726
01:47:33,970 --> 01:47:34,170

Thanksgiving songs.

1728
01:47:37,620 --> 01:47:40,410
They actually have thanksgiving music.
You fucking kidding me.

1729
01:47:44,570 --> 01:47:49,300
The Fuck Outta here? No, you
don't. You know what this
is. This is a classic thing.

1730
01:47:49,301 --> 01:47:52,450
When you go to search something and
it's just music. Shit just came up.

1731
01:47:52,451 --> 01:47:56,590
There's no thanks. Wait a minute, let me
go to fucking the evil that is iTunes.

1732
01:47:56,760 --> 01:47:58,870
This is the last thing I'm going
to do. This is over time. People.

Hi. I wish I knew about classical
music. I could have made that funny.

1754
01:49:28,960 --> 01:49:33,080
This is where, uh, we're out of
potatoes. The fifth movement,
