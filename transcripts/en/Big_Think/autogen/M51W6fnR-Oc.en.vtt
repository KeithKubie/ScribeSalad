00:00:06.279 --> 00:00:10.230
There’s a sort of a funny saying, which
is that whenever people are free to choose

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.949
anything they want, they usually choose what
their friends have chosen.&nbsp;

00:00:13.949 --> 00:00:17.290
This mimicry that we humans evince is extremely
fundamental.&nbsp;

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:25.060
Therefore, networks provide us a kind of mathematical,
social and biological tool to understand the

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:29.720
kind of fundamental basis for this mimicry
because you copy the people to whom you are

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:34.670
connected primarily and you come to copy them
along a whole variety of traits.&nbsp;

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:39.030
In the workplace these traits might include
things like how energized you are at work

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:44.590
or how innovative you are at work or how cooperative
you are at work or whether you smoke or not

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:46.440
or other health traits.&nbsp;

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.930
All these desirable properties -- your productivity,
your innovativeness, your cooperativeness,

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:57.719
your health -- come to depend upon the like
attributes in individuals to whom you're connected.&nbsp;

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:03.460
Our group and other groups have mapped networks
in the workplace, have come to understand

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:08.320
how people are connected to each other and
have used that understanding as a kind of

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:15.990
mechanism or tool, an opportunity for intervention,
in order to call forth from people better

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:22.060
behavior, if you will, more cooperativeness,
more innovativeness, more collaborative-ness

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.270
and better health behaviors.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.009
The usual way of understanding workplace organization
is the classic org chart where you have boxes

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:34.590
and names and it's like a tree, but actually
the real work or the real organization of

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.700
a workplace looks nothing like that.&nbsp;

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.289
It's the way people interact with each other.&nbsp;

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:39.560
It's a more jumble of ties.&nbsp;

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.640
It looks more like a jumble of Christmas tree
lights.&nbsp;

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.430
So if you can think of a network as every
node, every person is a little light and the

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:50.789
wires connecting them are the ties between
them, and when you take out a jumble of Christmas

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:54.979
tree lights and you put it on the floor and
look at it, actually that's what workplace

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:56.520
networks really look like.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.929
Once you understand those patterns of interactions
you can begin to understand how people influence

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:05.549
each other with respect to health and health
behaviors in the workplace, and once you understand

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:09.650
that pattern of interactions and that pattern
of influence you can begin to think about

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:11.230
ways of intervening in it.&nbsp;

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.120
For example, you can identify influential
individuals within the network and target

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:21.120
them with health interventions or you can
identify ways to get groups of people to sign

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.129
up for interventions.&nbsp;

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:26.849
And we know that when groups of people, particularly
people who know each other and are interconnected

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:32.290
collaboratively, engage in something such
as a health improvement behavior that they're

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:35.680
more likely to sustain it and more likely
to respond positively.

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.370
So once you understand the structure of human
interactions it opens up all kinds of new

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:41.320
vistas, new ways that you can intervene.&nbsp;

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:42.320
In fact, it's not just relevant when it comes
to health—in fact, it's not just relevant

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:43.320
when it comes to health to understand the
network of interactions of, let's say, lay

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:44.320
people or workers or regular old people.&nbsp;

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:44.332
It's also important to understand the pattern
of interactions among healthcare providers.&nbsp;
