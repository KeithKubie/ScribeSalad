00:00:06.442 --> 00:00:09.527
If you've ever floated on an ocean swell,

00:00:09.527 --> 00:00:12.749
you'll know that the sea moves constantly.

00:00:12.749 --> 00:00:14.962
Zoom out, and you'll see the larger picture:

00:00:14.962 --> 00:00:18.046
our Earth, covered by 71 percent water,

00:00:18.046 --> 00:00:21.608
moving in one enormous current around the planet.

00:00:21.608 --> 00:00:23.761
This intimidating global conveyor belt

00:00:23.761 --> 00:00:25.692
has many complicated drivers,

00:00:25.692 --> 00:00:28.192
but behind it all is a simple pump

00:00:28.192 --> 00:00:30.941
that moves water all over the earth.

00:00:30.941 --> 00:00:34.228
The process is called thermohaline circulation,

00:00:34.228 --> 00:00:36.192
and it's driven by a basic concept:

00:00:36.192 --> 00:00:43.135
the concentration gradient.

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:44.825
Let's leave the ocean for one moment

00:00:44.825 --> 00:00:46.610
and imagine we're in an empty room

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:49.156
with lots of Roombas sardined together

00:00:49.156 --> 00:00:50.739
in one corner.

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:52.243
Turn them all on at once

00:00:52.243 --> 00:00:53.991
and the machines glide outwards

00:00:53.991 --> 00:00:56.204
bumping into and away from each other

00:00:56.204 --> 00:01:00.241
until the room is filled with an evenly spaced distribution.

00:01:00.241 --> 00:01:02.126
The machines have moved randomly

00:01:02.126 --> 00:01:03.742
towards equilibrium,

00:01:03.742 --> 00:01:05.824
a place where the concentration of a substance

00:01:05.824 --> 00:01:07.658
is equally spread out.

00:01:07.658 --> 00:01:10.526
That's what happens along a concentration gradient,

00:01:10.526 --> 00:01:13.054
as substances shift passively from a high,

00:01:13.054 --> 00:01:14.906
or squashed, concentration,

00:01:14.906 --> 00:01:17.601
to a lower, more comfortable one.

00:01:17.601 --> 00:01:21.187
How does this relate to ocean currents and thermohaline circulation?

00:01:21.187 --> 00:01:22.939
Thermo means temperature,

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:24.524
and haline means salt

00:01:24.524 --> 00:01:26.777
because in the real world scenario of the sea,

00:01:26.777 --> 00:01:29.612
temperature and salinity drive the shift

00:01:29.612 --> 00:01:33.168
from high to low concentrations.

00:01:33.168 --> 00:01:34.792
Let's put you back in the ocean

00:01:34.792 --> 00:01:36.707
to see how this works.

00:01:36.707 --> 00:01:37.704
Snap!

00:01:37.704 --> 00:01:40.660
You're transformed into a molecule of surface water,

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:42.542
off the temperate coast of New York

00:01:42.542 --> 00:01:44.914
surrounded by a zillion rowdy others.

00:01:44.914 --> 00:01:47.791
Here, the sun's rays act as an energizer

00:01:47.791 --> 00:01:49.876
that set you and the other water molecules

00:01:49.876 --> 00:01:52.126
jostling about, bouncing off each other

00:01:52.126 --> 00:01:53.626
like the Roombas did.

00:01:53.626 --> 00:01:54.721
The more you spread out,

00:01:54.721 --> 00:01:56.852
the less concentrated the water molecules

00:01:56.852 --> 00:01:58.763
at the surface become.

00:01:58.763 --> 00:02:00.281
Through this passive motion,

00:02:00.281 --> 00:02:03.865
you move from a high to a lower concentration.

00:02:03.865 --> 00:02:05.948
Let's suspend the laws of physics for a moment,

00:02:05.948 --> 00:02:07.697
and pretend that your molecular self

00:02:07.697 --> 00:02:10.870
can plunge deep down into the water column.

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:12.198
In these colder depths,

00:02:12.198 --> 00:02:14.446
the comparative lack of solar warmth

00:02:14.446 --> 00:02:16.489
makes water molecules sluggish,

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:19.698
meaning they can sit quite still at high concentrations.

00:02:19.698 --> 00:02:21.446
No jostling here.

00:02:21.446 --> 00:02:22.615
But seeking relief

00:02:22.615 --> 00:02:24.249
from the cramped conditions they're in,

00:02:24.249 --> 00:02:26.364
they soon start moving upwards

00:02:26.364 --> 00:02:29.310
towards the roomier situation at the surface.

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:30.422
This is how temperature

00:02:30.422 --> 00:02:32.341
drives a shift of water molecules

00:02:32.341 --> 00:02:34.447
from high to low concentrations,

00:02:34.447 --> 00:02:36.135
towards equilibrium.

00:02:36.135 --> 00:02:39.198
But sea water is made up of more than just H2O.

00:02:39.198 --> 00:02:42.614
There are a great deal of salt ions in it as well.

00:02:42.614 --> 00:02:44.811
And like you, these guys have a similar desire

00:02:44.811 --> 00:02:46.532
for spacious real estate.

00:02:46.532 --> 00:02:48.365
As the sun warms the sea,

00:02:48.365 --> 00:02:50.198
some of your fellow water molecules

00:02:50.198 --> 00:02:52.032
evaporate from the surface,

00:02:52.032 --> 00:02:55.113
increasing the ration of salt to H2O.

00:02:55.113 --> 00:02:57.030
The crowded salt ions left behind

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:58.657
notice that lower down,

00:02:58.657 --> 00:03:01.364
salt molecules seem to be enjoying more space.

00:03:01.364 --> 00:03:03.114
And so an invasion begins,

00:03:03.114 --> 00:03:06.310
as they too move downwards in the water column.

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:07.615
In the polar regions,

00:03:07.615 --> 00:03:09.615
we see how this small local process

00:03:09.615 --> 00:03:11.447
effects global movement.

00:03:11.447 --> 00:03:13.116
In the arctic and antarctic,

00:03:13.116 --> 00:03:15.466
where ice slabs decorate the water's surface,

00:03:15.466 --> 00:03:16.927
there's little temperature difference

00:03:16.927 --> 00:03:19.310
between surface and deeper waters.

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:20.512
It's all pretty cold.

00:03:20.512 --> 00:03:22.058
But salinity differs,

00:03:22.058 --> 00:03:23.266
and in this scenario,

00:03:23.266 --> 00:03:24.976
that's what triggers the action.

00:03:24.976 --> 00:03:27.431
Here, the sun's rays melt surface ice,

00:03:27.431 --> 00:03:29.696
depositing a new load of water molecules

00:03:29.696 --> 00:03:31.280
into the sea.

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:33.407
That not only increases the proximity

00:03:33.407 --> 00:03:35.742
between you and other water molecules,

00:03:35.742 --> 00:03:37.886
leaving you vying for space again,

00:03:37.886 --> 00:03:39.885
but it also conversely dilutes

00:03:39.885 --> 00:03:42.166
the concentration of salt ions.

00:03:42.166 --> 00:03:43.416
So, down you go,

00:03:43.416 --> 00:03:45.084
riding along the concentration gradient

00:03:45.084 --> 00:03:47.386
towards more comfortable conditions.

00:03:47.386 --> 00:03:48.968
For salt ions, however,

00:03:48.968 --> 00:03:50.969
their lower concentration at the surface,

00:03:50.969 --> 00:03:52.676
acts like an advertisement

00:03:52.676 --> 00:03:55.470
to the clamoring masses of salt molecules below

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:57.469
who begin their assent.

00:03:57.469 --> 00:03:59.469
In both temperate and polar regions,

00:03:59.469 --> 00:04:02.385
this passive motion along a concentration gradient,

00:04:02.385 --> 00:04:04.190
can get a current going.

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:05.855
And that is the starting point

00:04:05.855 --> 00:04:07.136
of the global conveyor

00:04:07.136 --> 00:04:09.385
called thermohaline circulation.

00:04:09.385 --> 00:04:10.803
This is how a simple concept

00:04:10.803 --> 00:04:12.637
becomes the mechanism underlying

00:04:12.637 --> 00:04:13.737
one of the largest

00:04:13.737 --> 00:04:15.906
and most important systems on our planet.

00:04:15.906 --> 00:04:16.992
And if you look around,

00:04:16.992 --> 00:04:18.635
you'll see it happening everywhere.

00:04:18.635 --> 00:04:20.495
Turn on a light, and it's there.

00:04:20.495 --> 00:04:22.165
Concentration gradients govern

00:04:22.165 --> 00:04:23.802
the flow of electricity,

00:04:23.802 --> 00:04:26.219
allowing electrons squashed together in one space

00:04:26.219 --> 00:04:28.837
to travel to an area of lower concentration

00:04:28.837 --> 00:04:30.587
when a channel is opened,

00:04:30.587 --> 00:04:32.508
which you do by flipping a switch.

00:04:32.508 --> 00:04:35.382
Right now, in fact, there's some gradient action going on

00:04:35.382 --> 00:04:39.137
inside you as you breath air into your lungs

00:04:39.137 --> 00:04:41.219
letting the concentrated oxygen in that air

00:04:41.219 --> 00:04:43.266
move passively out of your lungs

00:04:43.266 --> 00:04:45.195
and into your blood stream.

00:04:45.195 --> 00:04:46.969
We know that the world is filled

00:04:46.969 --> 00:04:48.553
with complex physical problems,

00:04:48.553 --> 00:04:50.053
but sometimes the first step

00:04:50.053 --> 00:04:52.719
towards understanding them can be simple.

00:04:52.719 --> 00:04:54.070
So when you confront the magnitude

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:55.468
of the ocean's currents,

00:04:55.468 --> 00:04:57.534
or have to figure out how electricity works,

00:04:57.534 --> 00:04:59.284
remember not to panic.

00:04:59.284 --> 00:05:02.328
Understanding can be as simple as flipping a switch.
