needs an MRI box so it has a hint of a
sci-fi theme to it but it's still very

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:21.470
sci-fi theme to it but it's still very
 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:23.200

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:28.190
simple looking but it has to look like a
 

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:31.180

piece of medical equipment in a sense so

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:31.190
piece of medical equipment in a sense so
 

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:33.869
piece of medical equipment in a sense so
you know very sterile white clean lines

00:00:33.869 --> 00:00:33.879
you know very sterile white clean lines
 

00:00:33.879 --> 00:00:36.520
you know very sterile white clean lines
the best way that I thought of doing it

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:36.530
the best way that I thought of doing it
 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:39.490
the best way that I thought of doing it
was to create a box and vacuum format so

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:39.500
was to create a box and vacuum format so
 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.200
was to create a box and vacuum format so
I could have very smooth rounded edges

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:41.210
I could have very smooth rounded edges
 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:44.100
I could have very smooth rounded edges
and something that looks clean and

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:44.110
and something that looks clean and
 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:46.540
and something that looks clean and
simple but still has that element of

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:46.550
simple but still has that element of
 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:48.640
simple but still has that element of
something of a piece of equipment you

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:48.650
something of a piece of equipment you
 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:50.229
something of a piece of equipment you
know you could go to like a thrift store

00:00:50.229 --> 00:00:50.239
know you could go to like a thrift store
 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:52.719
know you could go to like a thrift store
and probably find a piece of kitchen

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:52.729
and probably find a piece of kitchen
 

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:55.630
and probably find a piece of kitchen
equipment or a piece of electronics or

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:55.640
equipment or a piece of electronics or
 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.130
equipment or a piece of electronics or
something like that that kind of looks

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:57.140
something like that that kind of looks
 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:58.990
something like that that kind of looks
like something you can kind of convert

00:00:58.990 --> 00:00:59.000
like something you can kind of convert
 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
like something you can kind of convert
it into whatever you want but what the

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.010
it into whatever you want but what the
 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:02.530
it into whatever you want but what the
client wanted was actually very very

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:02.540
client wanted was actually very very
 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:06.010
client wanted was actually very very
simple in a sense it was just a box and

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:06.020
simple in a sense it was just a box and
 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:08.200
simple in a sense it was just a box and
his dimensions he was kind of open to

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:08.210
his dimensions he was kind of open to
 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:10.240
his dimensions he was kind of open to
kind of within that frame of maybe like

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:10.250
kind of within that frame of maybe like
 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:12.700
kind of within that frame of maybe like
eight inches to 12 inches so I can't

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:12.710
eight inches to 12 inches so I can't
 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:14.770
eight inches to 12 inches so I can't
revise and just went to ten it had to

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:14.780
revise and just went to ten it had to
 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:17.709
revise and just went to ten it had to
have just one function button it was

00:01:17.709 --> 00:01:17.719
have just one function button it was
 

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:21.819
have just one function button it was
like a very simple just clean box with a

00:01:21.819 --> 00:01:21.829
like a very simple just clean box with a
 

00:01:21.829 --> 00:01:23.800
like a very simple just clean box with a
screen and one function button and that

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:23.810
screen and one function button and that
 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:25.539
screen and one function button and that
was that he didn't want any kind of

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:25.549
was that he didn't want any kind of
 

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:27.880
was that he didn't want any kind of
detailing on it or a logo or anything

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:27.890
detailing on it or a logo or anything
 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:29.889
detailing on it or a logo or anything
that kind of distinguished it it kind of

00:01:29.889 --> 00:01:29.899
that kind of distinguished it it kind of
 

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:31.179
that kind of distinguished it it kind of
won everything he kind of wanted it to

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:31.189
won everything he kind of wanted it to
 

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:33.660
won everything he kind of wanted it to
have an ambiguity to it that lent it

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:33.670
have an ambiguity to it that lent it
 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:36.130
have an ambiguity to it that lent it
gave it a bit of a mystery sort of I

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:36.140
gave it a bit of a mystery sort of I
 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:37.990
gave it a bit of a mystery sort of I
didn't want to necessarily pull like an

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:38.000
didn't want to necessarily pull like an
 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.240
didn't want to necessarily pull like an
object off the shelf like an old toaster

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:40.250
object off the shelf like an old toaster
 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:41.679
object off the shelf like an old toaster
or something like that or a little oven

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:41.689
or something like that or a little oven
 

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:42.969
or something like that or a little oven
something that was gonna be too

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:42.979
something that was gonna be too
 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:45.190
something that was gonna be too
recognizable even if I cleaned it up

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:45.200
recognizable even if I cleaned it up
 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.639
recognizable even if I cleaned it up
right dressed it up and and changed it

00:01:48.639 --> 00:01:48.649
right dressed it up and and changed it
 

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:51.340
right dressed it up and and changed it
enough to where it would look different

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:51.350
enough to where it would look different
 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:54.730
enough to where it would look different
I feel like you still would be like oh

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:54.740
I feel like you still would be like oh
 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:56.330
I feel like you still would be like oh
you know what that's my

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340
you know what that's my
 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.310
you know what that's my
as that toaster in her basement you know

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320
as that toaster in her basement you know
 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.330
as that toaster in her basement you know
I mean I would rather go with a

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340
I mean I would rather go with a
 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.969
I mean I would rather go with a
completely clean slate and create the

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979
completely clean slate and create the
 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:05.359
completely clean slate and create the
box completely from scratch that being

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369
box completely from scratch that being
 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.789
box completely from scratch that being
said I did up some sketches my first

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799
said I did up some sketches my first
 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:08.779
said I did up some sketches my first
ones were probably a little too

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789
ones were probably a little too
 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.309
ones were probably a little too
complicated and then I kind of worked

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319
complicated and then I kind of worked
 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.020
complicated and then I kind of worked
back you did leave you know some

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030
back you did leave you know some
 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.280
back you did leave you know some
creative license as I come up with some

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290
creative license as I come up with some
 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.039
creative license as I come up with some
ideas and show me what you got and I'm

00:02:16.039 --> 00:02:16.049
ideas and show me what you got and I'm
 

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:18.680
ideas and show me what you got and I'm
sure you know whatever you come up with

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690
sure you know whatever you come up with
 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:19.309
sure you know whatever you come up with
will be cool

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319
will be cool
 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:22.610
will be cool
so I sent up some sketches and we talked

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620
so I sent up some sketches and we talked
 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.559
so I sent up some sketches and we talked
back and forth and get feedback and

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:24.569
back and forth and get feedback and
 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:28.309
back and forth and get feedback and
basically this is my last sketch an SD

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:28.319
basically this is my last sketch an SD
 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:30.710
basically this is my last sketch an SD
it's very very simple

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720
it's very very simple
 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.170
it's very very simple
it's a lot less complicated this in my

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180
it's a lot less complicated this in my
 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.449
it's a lot less complicated this in my
first sketches what I'll do is I'm going

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:35.459
first sketches what I'll do is I'm going
 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:41.270
first sketches what I'll do is I'm going
to sculpt the box out of MDF board which

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280
to sculpt the box out of MDF board which
 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.110
to sculpt the box out of MDF board which
is like a press board basically you can

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120
is like a press board basically you can
 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.780
is like a press board basically you can
get very clean cuts out of it and sand

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790
get very clean cuts out of it and sand
 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:50.930
get very clean cuts out of it and sand
it very smooth and it's pretty easy to

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940
it very smooth and it's pretty easy to
 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.240
it very smooth and it's pretty easy to
work with so I think that's what we're

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250
work with so I think that's what we're
 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.759
work with so I think that's what we're
gonna do the other thing is then we're

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:55.769
gonna do the other thing is then we're
 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:57.319
gonna do the other thing is then we're
going to like as I said we're gonna use

00:02:57.319 --> 00:02:57.329
going to like as I said we're gonna use
 

00:02:57.329 --> 00:02:58.970
going to like as I said we're gonna use
the vacuform machine now I know you're

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980
the vacuform machine now I know you're
 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.340
the vacuform machine now I know you're
probably like I'm a banking floor

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.350
probably like I'm a banking floor
 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:03.319
probably like I'm a banking floor
machine and how the hell do you build

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:03.329
machine and how the hell do you build
 

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:05.330
machine and how the hell do you build
one well there actually are a lot of

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340
one well there actually are a lot of
 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.819
one well there actually are a lot of
tutorials online and how to build your

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:07.829
tutorials online and how to build your
 

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:10.099
tutorials online and how to build your
own makeshift kind of effective for

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:10.109
own makeshift kind of effective for
 

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:12.770
own makeshift kind of effective for
machine at home and it's really actually

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780
machine at home and it's really actually
 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:14.629
machine at home and it's really actually
very simple if you have like a high

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:14.639
very simple if you have like a high
 

00:03:14.639 --> 00:03:16.970
very simple if you have like a high
power vacuum or a shop vac or something

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980
power vacuum or a shop vac or something
 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.970
power vacuum or a shop vac or something
and you need a heat source the rest of

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980
and you need a heat source the rest of
 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:21.379
and you need a heat source the rest of
the stuff you can basically just build

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:21.389
the stuff you can basically just build
 

00:03:21.389 --> 00:03:23.390
the stuff you can basically just build
on your own I made you a tutorial in the

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400
on your own I made you a tutorial in the
 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.309
on your own I made you a tutorial in the
future of how I built mine but like I

00:03:25.309 --> 00:03:25.319
future of how I built mine but like I
 

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:27.349
future of how I built mine but like I
said there are a lot of tutorials on

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:27.359
said there are a lot of tutorials on
 

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:29.530
said there are a lot of tutorials on
YouTube and stuff like that that are

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:29.540
YouTube and stuff like that that are
 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:33.379
YouTube and stuff like that that are
very simple and very easy examples of

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:33.389
very simple and very easy examples of
 

00:03:33.389 --> 00:03:34.350
very simple and very easy examples of
how to build a back

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:34.360
how to build a back
 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:36.480
how to build a back
machine so we're just gonna measure out

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:36.490
machine so we're just gonna measure out
 

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:39.990
machine so we're just gonna measure out
our basic box and cut it out of the MDF

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:40.000
our basic box and cut it out of the MDF
 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.970
our basic box and cut it out of the MDF
board and then ya go from there now once

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:44.980
board and then ya go from there now once
 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:47.150
board and then ya go from there now once
I made my measurements and my cuts I

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160
I made my measurements and my cuts I
 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:50.760
I made my measurements and my cuts I
only had to make one side of the box

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:50.770
only had to make one side of the box
 

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:52.860
only had to make one side of the box
because I could just vacuum form that

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:52.870
because I could just vacuum form that
 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:56.190
because I could just vacuum form that
same shape four times and have my four

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:56.200
same shape four times and have my four
 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:58.080
same shape four times and have my four
sides and the bottom was going to be an

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:58.090
sides and the bottom was going to be an
 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:02.070
sides and the bottom was going to be an
extra piece of ABS plastic and the top

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:02.080
extra piece of ABS plastic and the top
 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:04.380
extra piece of ABS plastic and the top
was going to be a lens or a piece of

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:04.390
was going to be a lens or a piece of
 

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:06.000
was going to be a lens or a piece of
acrylic that the light could shine

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.010
acrylic that the light could shine
 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:08.250
acrylic that the light could shine
through so I double up the two pieces

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:08.260
through so I double up the two pieces
 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:09.630
through so I double up the two pieces
and rounded off the edges and the

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:09.640
and rounded off the edges and the
 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:19.199
and rounded off the edges and the
corners get a nice round shape we're

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:19.209
corners get a nice round shape we're
 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:22.200
corners get a nice round shape we're
gonna be using as I said ABS plastics

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:22.210
gonna be using as I said ABS plastics
 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:24.390
gonna be using as I said ABS plastics
thermoforming plastic there are a couple

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:24.400
thermoforming plastic there are a couple
 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:26.790
thermoforming plastic there are a couple
different kinds styrene and abs are the

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:26.800
different kinds styrene and abs are the
 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:27.990
different kinds styrene and abs are the
most common and you can get them in

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:28.000
most common and you can get them in
 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.030
most common and you can get them in
black white or clear obvious we're gonna

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:30.040
black white or clear obvious we're gonna
 

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:31.980
black white or clear obvious we're gonna
use white cuz I want that look this has

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:31.990
use white cuz I want that look this has
 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:33.570
use white cuz I want that look this has
got a nice ABS has a little bit of a

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:33.580
got a nice ABS has a little bit of a
 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:35.880
got a nice ABS has a little bit of a
glassy or shinier finish and on the

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:35.890
glassy or shinier finish and on the
 

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:37.710
glassy or shinier finish and on the
other side has a really kind of rough

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:37.720
other side has a really kind of rough
 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:39.750
other side has a really kind of rough
texture so this would be the inside of

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:39.760
texture so this would be the inside of
 

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:41.820

I took near like I build on machine

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:05.620
I took near like I build on machine
 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:07.500
I took near like I build on machine
because I want to do some larger pieces

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:07.510
because I want to do some larger pieces
 

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:11.159
because I want to do some larger pieces
and smaller pieces so the board actually

00:05:11.159 --> 00:05:11.169
and smaller pieces so the board actually
 

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:13.740
and smaller pieces so the board actually
comes out and I'm gonna place it with a

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:13.750
comes out and I'm gonna place it with a
 

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:18.600
comes out and I'm gonna place it with a
smaller one and you can buy sheets then

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:18.610
smaller one and you can buy sheets then
 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:21.810
smaller one and you can buy sheets then
in either 12 or 24 just easier to cut

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:21.820
in either 12 or 24 just easier to cut
 

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:23.790
in either 12 or 24 just easier to cut
them then so I'm just gonna stick this

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:23.800
them then so I'm just gonna stick this
 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:25.020
them then so I'm just gonna stick this
into my frame

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:25.030
into my frame
 

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:27.690
into my frame
so my frame is basically just that it

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:27.700
so my frame is basically just that it
 

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:30.420

says two pieces of plywood that I took

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:30.430
says two pieces of plywood that I took
 

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:33.690
says two pieces of plywood that I took
the center out of and then using a

end and some fasteners on the sides just

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:40.300
end and some fasteners on the sides just
 

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:42.360
end and some fasteners on the sides just
tighten it down and I've got some

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:42.370
tighten it down and I've got some
 

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:44.010

00:06:10.479 --> 00:06:15.019
 
turn down our heat alright now this is

00:06:15.019 --> 00:06:15.029
turn down our heat alright now this is
 

00:06:15.029 --> 00:06:19.049
turn down our heat alright now this is
basically just a garage heater it was

00:06:19.049 --> 00:06:19.059
basically just a garage heater it was
 

00:06:19.059 --> 00:06:21.629
basically just a garage heater it was
like 50 bucks or something and I created

00:06:21.629 --> 00:06:21.639
like 50 bucks or something and I created
 

00:06:21.639 --> 00:06:24.439
like 50 bucks or something and I created
this box that's lined with aluminum foil

00:06:24.439 --> 00:06:24.449
this box that's lined with aluminum foil
 

00:06:24.449 --> 00:06:27.059
this box that's lined with aluminum foil
and it's got a little bit of a reducer

00:06:27.059 --> 00:06:27.069
and it's got a little bit of a reducer
 

00:06:27.069 --> 00:06:28.140
and it's got a little bit of a reducer
to it

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:28.150
to it
 

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:31.679
to it
because the space heater or the garage

00:06:31.679 --> 00:06:31.689
because the space heater or the garage
 

00:06:31.689 --> 00:06:36.049
because the space heater or the garage
here that I had was like 24 inches by

00:06:36.049 --> 00:06:36.059
here that I had was like 24 inches by
 

00:06:36.059 --> 00:06:38.820
here that I had was like 24 inches by
like 12 inches maybe so I had to kind of

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:38.830
like 12 inches maybe so I had to kind of
 

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:41.369
like 12 inches maybe so I had to kind of
reduce it on either side so it kind of

00:06:41.369 --> 00:06:41.379
reduce it on either side so it kind of
 

00:06:41.379 --> 00:06:43.320
reduce it on either side so it kind of
fans out and then I created this box

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:43.330
fans out and then I created this box
 

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:45.059
fans out and then I created this box
it's like an insulated put some

00:06:45.059 --> 00:06:45.069
it's like an insulated put some
 

00:06:45.069 --> 00:06:46.920
it's like an insulated put some
insulation in there so the heat is all

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:46.930
insulation in there so the heat is all
 

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:50.089
insulation in there so the heat is all
directed down towards our substrate

00:06:50.089 --> 00:06:50.099
directed down towards our substrate
 

00:06:50.099 --> 00:06:53.579
directed down towards our substrate
which abs we're using and I'm using a

00:06:53.579 --> 00:06:53.589
which abs we're using and I'm using a
 

00:06:53.589 --> 00:06:55.890
which abs we're using and I'm using a
1/16 thickness which is get a nice

00:06:55.890 --> 00:06:55.900
1/16 thickness which is get a nice
 

00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:57.869
1/16 thickness which is get a nice
rigidity to it so it's gonna be a nice

00:06:57.869 --> 00:06:57.879
rigidity to it so it's gonna be a nice
 

00:06:57.879 --> 00:07:00.989
rigidity to it so it's gonna be a nice
hard plastic it's not too thick to where

00:07:00.989 --> 00:07:00.999
hard plastic it's not too thick to where
 

00:07:00.999 --> 00:07:04.139
hard plastic it's not too thick to where
we can't get a good mold or a good

00:07:04.139 --> 00:07:04.149
we can't get a good mold or a good
 

00:07:04.149 --> 00:07:06.389
we can't get a good mold or a good
vacuum seal over it but it still has a

00:07:06.389 --> 00:07:06.399
vacuum seal over it but it still has a
 

00:07:06.399 --> 00:07:09.329
vacuum seal over it but it still has a
nice rigidity that will create a nice

00:07:09.329 --> 00:07:09.339
nice rigidity that will create a nice
 

00:07:09.339 --> 00:07:11.869
nice rigidity that will create a nice
hard box if you're going to be doing

00:07:11.869 --> 00:07:11.879
hard box if you're going to be doing
 

00:07:11.879 --> 00:07:16.320
hard box if you're going to be doing
that conforming to create like an armor

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:16.330
that conforming to create like an armor
 

00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:17.399
that conforming to create like an armor
or something that we want to make storm

00:07:17.399 --> 00:07:17.409
or something that we want to make storm
 

00:07:17.409 --> 00:07:18.830
or something that we want to make storm
trooper or something like that that's

00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:18.840
trooper or something like that that's
 

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:20.740
trooper or something like that that's
I think there's probably a pretty good

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:20.750
I think there's probably a pretty good
 

00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:23.600
I think there's probably a pretty good
thickness I would say if you know you

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:23.610
thickness I would say if you know you
 

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:24.830
thickness I would say if you know you
might go a little bit thinner it's gonna

00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:24.840
might go a little bit thinner it's gonna
 

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:28.460
might go a little bit thinner it's gonna
be a little bit cheaper if you styrene

00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:28.470
be a little bit cheaper if you styrene
 

00:07:28.470 --> 00:07:30.020
be a little bit cheaper if you styrene
that's a little bit cheaper but it's

00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:30.030
that's a little bit cheaper but it's
 

00:07:30.030 --> 00:07:33.170
that's a little bit cheaper but it's
also it's it's not as sturdy its abs I

00:07:33.170 --> 00:07:33.180
also it's it's not as sturdy its abs I
 

00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:34.640
also it's it's not as sturdy its abs I
don't think so

00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:34.650
don't think so
 

00:07:34.650 --> 00:07:36.170
don't think so
so we're going to be for this to heat up

00:07:36.170 --> 00:07:36.180
so we're going to be for this to heat up
 

00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:38.920
so we're going to be for this to heat up
it should take about seven eight minutes

00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:38.930
it should take about seven eight minutes
 

00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:41.270
it should take about seven eight minutes
for this heat so it kind of depends on

00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:41.280
for this heat so it kind of depends on
 

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:46.520
for this heat so it kind of depends on
what you're using but then once it heats

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:46.530
what you're using but then once it heats
 

00:07:46.530 --> 00:07:49.280
what you're using but then once it heats
up we'll drop it down over our vacuum

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:49.290
up we'll drop it down over our vacuum
 

00:07:49.290 --> 00:07:50.930
up we'll drop it down over our vacuum
box turn on the vacuum it's going to

00:07:50.930 --> 00:07:50.940
box turn on the vacuum it's going to
 

00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:54.080
box turn on the vacuum it's going to
suck the air out and plataform over our

00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:54.090
suck the air out and plataform over our
 

00:07:54.090 --> 00:07:57.500
suck the air out and plataform over our
positive it's just a waiting game down

00:07:57.500 --> 00:07:57.510
positive it's just a waiting game down
 

00:07:57.510 --> 00:08:04.810
positive it's just a waiting game down
okay it's got a pretty good sale going

00:08:04.810 --> 00:08:04.820
 
 

00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:08.240
 
so thing is you don't really too long

00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:08.250
so thing is you don't really too long
 

00:08:08.250 --> 00:08:10.040
so thing is you don't really too long
and have it burn a hole or melt all

00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:10.050
and have it burn a hole or melt all
 

00:08:10.050 --> 00:08:11.900
and have it burn a hole or melt all
together and fall out to your table

00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:11.910
together and fall out to your table
 

00:08:11.910 --> 00:08:13.460
together and fall out to your table
that's not going to be good itself

00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:13.470
that's not going to be good itself
 

00:08:13.470 --> 00:08:43.029
that's not going to be good itself
think we're pretty good

00:08:43.029 --> 00:08:43.039
 
 

00:08:43.039 --> 00:08:48.520
 
that's it

00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:48.530
 
 

00:08:48.530 --> 00:08:51.100
 
now I just cut my form out the plastic

00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:51.110
now I just cut my form out the plastic
 

00:08:51.110 --> 00:08:53.590
now I just cut my form out the plastic
using my rotary tool and then sanded the

00:08:53.590 --> 00:08:53.600
using my rotary tool and then sanded the
 

00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:58.480
using my rotary tool and then sanded the
edges down then once I hit it all sanded

00:08:58.480 --> 00:08:58.490
edges down then once I hit it all sanded
 

00:08:58.490 --> 00:09:02.560
edges down then once I hit it all sanded
down all the edges are clean I glued the

00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:02.570
down all the edges are clean I glued the
 

00:09:02.570 --> 00:09:05.200
down all the edges are clean I glued the
box together using a two-part epoxy and

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:05.210
box together using a two-part epoxy and
 

00:09:05.210 --> 00:09:10.880
box together using a two-part epoxy and
it bonds really well the plastics

00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:10.890
 
 

00:09:10.890 --> 00:09:15.210
 
just curing didn't have to be too clean

00:09:15.210 --> 00:09:15.220
just curing didn't have to be too clean
 

00:09:15.220 --> 00:09:16.740
just curing didn't have to be too clean
on the inside because you're never gonna

00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:16.750
on the inside because you're never gonna
 

00:09:16.750 --> 00:09:18.540
on the inside because you're never gonna
see the inside the top is going to have

00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:18.550
see the inside the top is going to have
 

00:09:18.550 --> 00:09:21.330
see the inside the top is going to have
a clear acrylic lens that the light can

00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:21.340
a clear acrylic lens that the light can
 

00:09:21.340 --> 00:09:26.880
a clear acrylic lens that the light can
shine through so using a simple socket

00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:26.890
shine through so using a simple socket
 

00:09:26.890 --> 00:09:30.930
shine through so using a simple socket
it's an extra wire and button that I

00:09:30.930 --> 00:09:30.940
it's an extra wire and button that I
 

00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:33.780
it's an extra wire and button that I
have it is wired up using an old

00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:33.790
have it is wired up using an old
 

00:09:33.790 --> 00:09:39.740
have it is wired up using an old
extension cord as my plug

00:09:39.740 --> 00:09:39.750
 
 

00:09:39.750 --> 00:09:47.090
 
shop light the red bulb from Home Depot

00:09:47.090 --> 00:09:47.100
 
 

00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:51.130
 
pretty simple

00:09:51.130 --> 00:09:51.140
 
 

00:09:51.140 --> 00:09:54.580
 
test it out

00:09:54.580 --> 00:09:54.590
 
 

00:09:54.590 --> 00:09:57.960
 
works

00:09:57.960 --> 00:09:57.970
 
 

00:09:57.970 --> 00:10:00.509
 
and as I said I used a piece of acrylic

00:10:00.509 --> 00:10:00.519
and as I said I used a piece of acrylic
 

00:10:00.519 --> 00:10:04.229
and as I said I used a piece of acrylic
for my lens so you don't want to see the

00:10:04.229 --> 00:10:04.239
for my lens so you don't want to see the
 

00:10:04.239 --> 00:10:05.129
for my lens so you don't want to see the
the light bulb

00:10:05.129 --> 00:10:05.139
the light bulb
 

00:10:05.139 --> 00:10:17.170
the light bulb
so use a frosted really

00:10:17.170 --> 00:10:17.180
 
 

00:10:17.180 --> 00:10:19.640
 
that's completely peace

00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:19.650
that's completely peace
 

00:10:19.650 --> 00:10:23.540
that's completely peace
oh no I'm sure not pretty well the

00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:23.550
oh no I'm sure not pretty well the
 

00:10:23.550 --> 00:10:26.210
oh no I'm sure not pretty well the
client was happy

00:10:26.210 --> 00:10:26.220
 
 

00:10:26.220 --> 00:10:28.220
 
and the footage that you're about to see

00:10:28.220 --> 00:10:28.230
and the footage that you're about to see
 

00:10:28.230 --> 00:10:32.450
and the footage that you're about to see
is footage that they provided over the

00:10:32.450 --> 00:10:32.460
is footage that they provided over the
 

00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:35.840
is footage that they provided over the
film synthetic love I still haven't seen

00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:35.850
film synthetic love I still haven't seen
 

00:10:35.850 --> 00:10:38.960
film synthetic love I still haven't seen
the film but basically I think it's like

00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:38.970
the film but basically I think it's like
 

00:10:38.970 --> 00:10:41.960
the film but basically I think it's like
a dark romantic comedy play with some

00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:41.970
a dark romantic comedy play with some
 

00:10:41.970 --> 00:10:45.110
a dark romantic comedy play with some
kind of sci-fi type element with the

00:10:45.110 --> 00:10:45.120
kind of sci-fi type element with the
 

00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:48.550
kind of sci-fi type element with the
whole like portable MRI machine II

00:10:48.550 --> 00:10:48.560
whole like portable MRI machine II
 

00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:52.310
whole like portable MRI machine II
obviously this is a very simplified MRI

00:10:52.310 --> 00:10:52.320
obviously this is a very simplified MRI
 

00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:55.600
obviously this is a very simplified MRI
machine there is no attempt to make it

00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:55.610
machine there is no attempt to make it
 

00:10:55.610 --> 00:10:59.660
machine there is no attempt to make it
literal in the sense that as the be

00:10:59.660 --> 00:10:59.670
literal in the sense that as the be
 

00:10:59.670 --> 00:11:13.790
literal in the sense that as the be
believable it's just a plot device

00:11:13.790 --> 00:11:13.800
 
 

00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:16.470
 
all right so here's the completed MRI

00:11:16.470 --> 00:11:16.480
all right so here's the completed MRI
 

00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:18.210
all right so here's the completed MRI
box the client said that I actually

00:11:18.210 --> 00:11:18.220
box the client said that I actually
 

00:11:18.220 --> 00:11:19.590
box the client said that I actually
didn't have to put a battery in it it

00:11:19.590 --> 00:11:19.600
didn't have to put a battery in it it
 

00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:20.790
didn't have to put a battery in it it
could just plug in so let's simplify

00:11:20.790 --> 00:11:20.800
could just plug in so let's simplify
 

00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:22.049
could just plug in so let's simplify
things quite a bit

00:11:22.049 --> 00:11:22.059
things quite a bit
 

00:11:22.059 --> 00:11:25.590
things quite a bit
I had the parts already so it's just

00:11:25.590 --> 00:11:25.600
I had the parts already so it's just
 

00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:28.949
I had the parts already so it's just
that simple socket you've got your

00:11:28.949 --> 00:11:28.959
that simple socket you've got your
 

00:11:28.959 --> 00:11:32.040
that simple socket you've got your
positive and negative on either side I

00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:32.050
positive and negative on either side I
 

00:11:32.050 --> 00:11:34.739
positive and negative on either side I
got plenty of black and white wire an

00:11:34.739 --> 00:11:34.749
got plenty of black and white wire an
 

00:11:34.749 --> 00:11:37.470
got plenty of black and white wire an
extension cord or a piece of cable or

00:11:37.470 --> 00:11:37.480
extension cord or a piece of cable or
 

00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:40.169
extension cord or a piece of cable or
something like that or an old power

00:11:40.169 --> 00:11:40.179
something like that or an old power
 

00:11:40.179 --> 00:11:42.299
something like that or an old power
cable is something that doesn't work

00:11:42.299 --> 00:11:42.309
cable is something that doesn't work
 

00:11:42.309 --> 00:11:45.660
cable is something that doesn't work
anymore and just cut it off I keep those

00:11:45.660 --> 00:11:45.670
anymore and just cut it off I keep those
 

00:11:45.670 --> 00:11:48.900
anymore and just cut it off I keep those
around because you never know when you

00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:48.910
around because you never know when you
 

00:11:48.910 --> 00:11:51.900
around because you never know when you
might need it so yeah and the switch was

00:11:51.900 --> 00:11:51.910
might need it so yeah and the switch was
 

00:11:51.910 --> 00:11:55.859
might need it so yeah and the switch was
just in a bag full of switches that I

00:11:55.859 --> 00:11:55.869
just in a bag full of switches that I
 

00:11:55.869 --> 00:11:57.689
just in a bag full of switches that I
have I collect switches all kinds of

00:11:57.689 --> 00:11:57.699
have I collect switches all kinds of
 

00:11:57.699 --> 00:12:00.119
have I collect switches all kinds of
switches when parts and stuff like that

00:12:00.119 --> 00:12:00.129
switches when parts and stuff like that
 

00:12:00.129 --> 00:12:03.919
switches when parts and stuff like that
break down or electrical equipment

00:12:03.919 --> 00:12:03.929
break down or electrical equipment
 

00:12:03.929 --> 00:12:06.499
break down or electrical equipment
sometimes I just go and buy switches at

00:12:06.499 --> 00:12:06.509
sometimes I just go and buy switches at
 

00:12:06.509 --> 00:12:08.400
sometimes I just go and buy switches at
American science and surplus or the

00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:08.410
American science and surplus or the
 

00:12:08.410 --> 00:12:09.960
American science and surplus or the
hardware store or something if I see a

00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:09.970
hardware store or something if I see a
 

00:12:09.970 --> 00:12:12.179
hardware store or something if I see a
cool switch on an old piece of

00:12:12.179 --> 00:12:12.189
cool switch on an old piece of
 

00:12:12.189 --> 00:12:13.499
cool switch on an old piece of
industrial equipment or something like

00:12:13.499 --> 00:12:13.509
industrial equipment or something like
 

00:12:13.509 --> 00:12:15.449
industrial equipment or something like
that I'll take it off a lot of times

00:12:15.449 --> 00:12:15.459
that I'll take it off a lot of times
 

00:12:15.459 --> 00:12:16.980
that I'll take it off a lot of times
yeah they still work is which is still

00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:16.990
yeah they still work is which is still
 

00:12:16.990 --> 00:12:19.530
yeah they still work is which is still
good test them but I've had this switch

00:12:19.530 --> 00:12:19.540
good test them but I've had this switch
 

00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:21.600
good test them but I've had this switch
sit in a bag switches for years and

00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:21.610
sit in a bag switches for years and
 

00:12:21.610 --> 00:12:23.340
sit in a bag switches for years and
wanted to have a use for it and I think

00:12:23.340 --> 00:12:23.350
wanted to have a use for it and I think
 

00:12:23.350 --> 00:12:25.350
wanted to have a use for it and I think
they kind of fit this perfectly he

00:12:25.350 --> 00:12:25.360
they kind of fit this perfectly he
 

00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:28.139
they kind of fit this perfectly he
wanted a switch that was very much like

00:12:28.139 --> 00:12:28.149
wanted a switch that was very much like
 

00:12:28.149 --> 00:12:31.679
wanted a switch that was very much like
a video game button and I actually have

00:12:31.679 --> 00:12:31.689
a video game button and I actually have
 

00:12:31.689 --> 00:12:33.960
a video game button and I actually have
one but this was that was a little

00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:33.970
one but this was that was a little
 

00:12:33.970 --> 00:12:35.639
one but this was that was a little
cooler with the it actually had the

00:12:35.639 --> 00:12:35.649
cooler with the it actually had the
 

00:12:35.649 --> 00:12:41.009
cooler with the it actually had the
metallic tightening nut on here

00:12:41.009 --> 00:12:41.019
metallic tightening nut on here
 

00:12:41.019 --> 00:12:44.669
metallic tightening nut on here
I used that metallic tape to cover up my

00:12:44.669 --> 00:12:44.679
I used that metallic tape to cover up my
 

00:12:44.679 --> 00:12:49.319
I used that metallic tape to cover up my
scenes I know it's pretty cheap trick so

00:12:49.319 --> 00:12:49.329
scenes I know it's pretty cheap trick so
 

00:12:49.329 --> 00:12:54.139
scenes I know it's pretty cheap trick so
this is it simple completely dimensional

00:12:54.139 --> 00:12:54.149
this is it simple completely dimensional
 

00:12:54.149 --> 00:12:57.509
this is it simple completely dimensional
at different phases I want the face of

00:12:57.509 --> 00:12:57.519
at different phases I want the face of
 

00:12:57.519 --> 00:13:02.489
at different phases I want the face of
it to be completely clean I don't want

00:13:02.489 --> 00:13:02.499
it to be completely clean I don't want
 

00:13:02.499 --> 00:13:07.439
it to be completely clean I don't want
any Bosman or any raised elements on the

00:13:07.439 --> 00:13:07.449
any Bosman or any raised elements on the
 

00:13:07.449 --> 00:13:09.179
any Bosman or any raised elements on the
face of it I wanted that to be the most

00:13:09.179 --> 00:13:09.189
face of it I wanted that to be the most
 

00:13:09.189 --> 00:13:12.559
face of it I wanted that to be the most
ambiguous part of the of the piece and

00:13:12.559 --> 00:13:12.569
ambiguous part of the of the piece and
 

00:13:12.569 --> 00:13:15.660
ambiguous part of the of the piece and
yeah like I said it's very simple just a

00:13:15.660 --> 00:13:15.670
yeah like I said it's very simple just a
 

00:13:15.670 --> 00:13:18.509
yeah like I said it's very simple just a
simple white box but with rounded edges

00:13:18.509 --> 00:13:18.519
simple white box but with rounded edges
 

00:13:18.519 --> 00:13:19.540
simple white box but with rounded edges
and

00:13:19.540 --> 00:13:19.550
and
 

00:13:19.550 --> 00:13:22.059
and
so it looks pretty clean it's got a nice

00:13:22.059 --> 00:13:22.069
so it looks pretty clean it's got a nice
 

00:13:22.069 --> 00:13:28.239
so it looks pretty clean it's got a nice
gloss to it and yeah lights up your home
