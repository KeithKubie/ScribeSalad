00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:12.990
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: Good
afternoon, everybody.

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:14.380
Welcome to the Library
of Congress.

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:16.880
I'm John Haskell, the
Director of the Kluge Center

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:20.560
which sits right over
there through that wall.

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:25.120
And we have our conference today
exploring important questions

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:26.910
about the bible and
U.S. History.

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.650
I just want to let you know
that the program is being filmed

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:32.050
for the Library of Congress,
and Kluge Center websites,

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:34.290
as well as for the
Kluge Center YouTube,

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.540
and iTube -- iTunes channels.

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:40.350
Just a quick word
about the Kluge Center.

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.630
I know a lot of you
know something about it,

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:44.740
but a lot of you don't
know anything about it.

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:48.720
So, it was created 18 years
ago through a generous gift

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:51.580
from philanthropist
John W. Kluge.

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:54.470
The Kluge Center's purpose
is to bring together scholars

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:56.300
and researchers,
to distill wisdom

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.630
from the Library's
resources, and interact

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:01.130
with policymakers
and the public.

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:03.570
In the words of our charter,
the Kluge Center is here

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.110
to bridge the divide between
scholarship and policymaking.

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:10.570
The Kluge Center also
-- and this is a --

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:12.450
my timely announcement --

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:18.020
awards typically every other
year a $1 million prize

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:20.990
for achievement in
the study of Humanity.

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:23.630
The next award winner will
be announced on Tuesday

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:27.500
in a press release by Dr.
Carla Hayden, our librarian.

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.970
This will be her first selection

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.910
as the winner of
the Kluge prize.

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:35.010
So, I encourage you to go.

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:36.310
[ Background noise ]

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:37.650
Of course, it will be announced
on the Library's website,

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.440
but I'd rather you go to the
Kluge Center website especially

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:45.010
since if you look at the Kluge
Center website today you might

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:48.580
not be overwhelmed by
how up to date it is.

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:50.890
But we will have
a newly designed

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:55.580
and much more user friendly
website by next Tuesday.

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:59.800
And so, I hope you will consult
it not to just look to see

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.280
who the winner is, but
also for other purposes.

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.050
The panel we're hosting
today is a part

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:08.480
of the Annual Scholar's
Council meeting at the Library.

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:11.560
The Scholar's Council is a body
of distinguished scholars --

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.300
many of whom are here
today at this meeting --

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.030
conveyed by the Librarian
of Congress --

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:18.000
convened by the Librarian
of Congress to advise

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.110
on matters related to
scholarship at the Library,

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:22.890
as well as scholar selection,

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.440
and other issues at
the Kluge Center.

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.220
Mark Noll -- one

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:30.290
of our Scholar's Council members
sitting directly right here

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:32.800
to my left -- has
convened today's panel

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.860
on the bible in American
history.

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.370
Dr. Noll is the Francis A.
McAnarney [assumed spelling]

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:39.190
professor of History of
Merida's [assumed spelling]

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:41.280
at the University of Notre Dame.

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.280
His recent publications include
"In the Beginning was the Word:

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:49.670
The Bible in American
Public Life 1492-1783".

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:54.240
That was a 2016 publication,
Oxford University Press.

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:57.410
He also wrote "19th Century
American Biblical Interpretation

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:01.650
in the Oxford Handbook of the
Bible in America" in 2017,

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:05.640
and the Catholic Press "The
Bible and Responsibility

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:10.010
for the Civil War - Journal
of the Civil War Era" --

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:11.310
[ Coughing ]

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:12.610
-- September 2017.

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:14.570
And also, recently he wrote
"The Bible Then and Now"

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:17.620
and "The Bible in American
Life" Oxford University Press.

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:20.110
I'm going to turn this
over to Mark and he's going

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:22.970
to introduce the other
people on the panel.

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:25.200
Welcome.

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.230
&gt;&gt; Mark Noll: It's a
real privilege to be

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:30.610
at The Kluge Center,
the Library of Congress.

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:36.200
Once again, a real privilege
to introduce today's panel.

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:39.380
Library of Congress is
an ideal physical setting

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:42.520
to consider our subject
this afternoon.

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:44.910
Just to the west of
where we are now sitting,

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:49.230
Abraham Lincoln quoted four
spirit - scriptural passages

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:53.460
in his short, but incomparable
second inaugural address

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:58.020
which he delivered March
4th, 1865 on the east steps

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:59.320
of the Capitol building.

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:01.620
In addition, he explained

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:04.930
that the Civil War had
been especially grievous

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:10.590
because both read the same
bible and pray to the same God.

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:13.560
Nearly a center -- century
after Lincoln spoke these words,

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:16.440
Martin Luther King, Jr.
likewise put scripture

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:19.760
to use strategically in
his address on the March

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:21.620
on Washington for
Jobs and Freedom.

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:25.230
For King, speaking from the east
front of the Lincoln Memorial

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:30.280
on August 28th, 1963, quotations
from the biblical book of Amos,

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:34.260
"Let justice roll down like
waters and righteousness

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:37.200
like a mighty stream"
and the book of Isaiah,

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:39.770
"Every valley shall be exalted.

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:42.610
Every hill and mountain
should be made.

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:45.640
Built the high plant form
from which he could dream

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:48.400
about a more just nation."

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:50.770
The bible in American
history defines a subject

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:53.430
of great depth and complexity.

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:57.100
For countless Americans, high
estate and low, slave and free,

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:59.100
male and female, red and yellow,

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:02.280
black and white scripture
has been the doorway

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:04.810
to personal experience with God.

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:07.560
To these and many others,
the bible also has functioned

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:10.860
as a guide to life
sometimes with liberating

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:17.140
or comic effects, sometimes with
oppressive or tragic results.

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:19.150
Scripture's obviously
played a dominant part

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:21.520
in organized religious
activities all Christian

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:23.870
and Jewish traditions, as well

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:26.520
as with variations among
Muslims, and believers

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:29.010
in other sacred texts.

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:30.310
[ Coughing ]

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:31.610
As a tangible object,

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:34.700
it has been a ubiquitous
physical presence sanctifying

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:38.890
all manner of homes, but
also focusing rituals,

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:40.230
stimulating commerce,

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:41.990
distinguishing ethnic
communities,

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:43.450
and naming the landscape.

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:46.850
It is made an incalculably
large contribution

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:50.010
to the construction
of culture --

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:51.310
[ Clears throat ]

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:53.190
-- in vernacular and elite
speech, in political persuasion,

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:57.450
in iconic and literary
representation, and scholarship

00:05:57.450 --> 00:05:59.420
in legal reasoning
and in entertainment.

00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:03.220
It is no exaggeration to
claim that the bible has been

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:07.530
and by far the single
most widely read text,

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:10.170
distributed object,
and referenced book

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:12.800
in all of American history.

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:15.490
Today it's a real pleasure
to introduce the panelists

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:18.860
who will be examining what
might be considered tidbits,

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:22.660
but really interesting tidbits
related to this vast subject.

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:26.220
My introduction you've heard
and my subject will be Tom Payne

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:29.010
and the bible in the
early United States.

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:32.920
Our next presenter will be
Paul Gutjahr who is Professor

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:35.300
and Chair of the
Department of English

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:40.280
at Indiana University
though Paul has just told me

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:45.010
that he's been raised or
lowered into the Dean's office.

00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:46.310
[ Laughter ]

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:47.610
Paul has produced a remarkable
array of insightful works

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:49.380
of publishing and
literacy in U.S. History.

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:51.170
He has edited or co-edited
books on typography

00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:52.840
and textual interpretation
as well

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:55.670
as on 19th Century
American popular literature.

00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:58.690
He has published, "The Book
of Mormon: A Biography"

00:06:58.690 --> 00:07:01.880
with Princeton University
Press and Charles Hodge,

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:05.370
Guardian of American
Orthodoxy from Oxford.

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:08.150
For our purposes today,
it is most significant

00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:11.180
that he is the author
of "An American Bible:

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:13.310
A History of the Good
Book in the United States"

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:16.800
and recently has edited
the "Oxford Handbook

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:18.520
of the Bible in America".

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:22.470
His subject today is the bible
and Noah's Ark in America.

00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:26.950
Our next presenter is Valerie
Cooper, associate professor

00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:29.500
of Religion and Society
in Black Church Studies

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:32.570
at the Divinity School
of Duke University.

00:07:32.570 --> 00:07:33.960
Her teaching and
scholarship concentrates

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:35.260
on religion, race, politics --

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:36.560
[ Coughing ]

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:38.820
-- and other culture.

00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:41.700
Along with published
essays on African Americans

00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:45.020
and the holiness in Pentecostal
traditions, she's the co-author

00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:46.560
of an essay on religion and race

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:50.060
in the 2008 presidential
election.

00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:53.900
In 2012, she published
"Word like Fire:

00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:55.380
Maria Stewart [assumed
spelling], the bible

00:07:55.380 --> 00:07:56.970
and the Rights of
African Americans"

00:07:56.970 --> 00:07:59.380
from the University
Press of Virginia.

00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:02.980
She is currently at work
on "Racial Reconciliation:

00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:06.020
An American Christian
Organization since the 1990's".

00:08:06.020 --> 00:08:09.260
Her subject today is
"The Bible and the Rights

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:11.870
of African Americans".

00:08:11.870 --> 00:08:14.360
Our last presenter is Lincoln
Mullen, Assistant Professor

00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:17.470
of History at nearby
George Mason University.

00:08:17.470 --> 00:08:20.500
Lincoln has pioneered in
the use of digital research

00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:23.720
for exploring subjects in
law, politics and religion.

00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:27.930
He's the co-author of a
recently published article

00:08:27.930 --> 00:08:32.290
in the American Historic
Review on Digital Text Analysis

00:08:32.290 --> 00:08:34.940
and U.S. Legal Practice.

00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:36.920
His book, "The Choice
of Salvation:

00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:39.590
The History of Conversion in
America" was published last year

00:08:39.590 --> 00:08:41.800
by Harvard University Press.

00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:45.940
Most relevant for today
is his forthcoming volume,

00:08:45.940 --> 00:08:47.780
"America's Public Bible:

00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:51.250
Biblical Quotations
in U.S. Newspapers".

00:08:51.250 --> 00:08:53.410
His talk comes from
that project, the bible

00:08:53.410 --> 00:08:55.400
and America's newspapers.

00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:57.280
We'll proceed with
the four presentations

00:08:57.280 --> 00:09:01.100
without interruption which
should I hope leave us plenty

00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:05.670
of time for reaction
from you folks here.

00:09:05.670 --> 00:09:10.370
So, "Tom Payne -- the
Founding and the Bible

00:09:10.370 --> 00:09:13.950
in the Early United States" --

00:09:13.950 --> 00:09:16.410
the history of scripture

00:09:16.410 --> 00:09:21.530
in the early United States
flowed directly from its history

00:09:21.530 --> 00:09:24.730
in the colonial and
revolutionary periods,

00:09:24.730 --> 00:09:27.290
but with developments
of great significance.

00:09:27.290 --> 00:09:31.180
In that earlier history,
a vast majority

00:09:31.180 --> 00:09:34.110
of the continent's European
settlers treated the bible

00:09:34.110 --> 00:09:39.220
as revelation from God
deserving highest respect.

00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:43.340
During the intermittent imperial
crises of the mid-18th Century,

00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:46.250
spellbinding preachers
like Samuel Davies

00:09:46.250 --> 00:09:49.600
of Virginia routinely
defined that conflict

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:54.330
as an apocalyptic clash
between on the one side France,

00:09:54.330 --> 00:09:58.910
Catholicism, tyranny and the
Pope over against Britain,

00:09:58.910 --> 00:10:01.080
Protestantism, poverty
and the bible.

00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:06.920
During the War for Independence,
a far greater host led

00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:09.050
by clergymen, but
also reinforced

00:10:09.050 --> 00:10:11.740
by [inaudible] substituted
for Britain.

00:10:11.740 --> 00:10:14.320
For France, it once
again viewed the conflict

00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:15.820
in apocalyptic terms.

00:10:15.820 --> 00:10:18.860
Now it was Parliament,
corruption,

00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:20.320
enslavement by Parliament

00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:23.130
and a veno-anglican [assumed
spelling] church establishment

00:10:23.130 --> 00:10:26.230
over against the
continental Congress, virtue,

00:10:26.230 --> 00:10:29.010
liberty and the bible.

00:10:29.010 --> 00:10:33.140
In those dramatic days,

00:10:33.140 --> 00:10:36.690
no one had more effectively
enlisted scripture

00:10:36.690 --> 00:10:39.390
for the patriot cause
than Tom Payne,

00:10:39.390 --> 00:10:43.050
the peripatetic English
radical whose riveting pamphlet

00:10:43.050 --> 00:10:47.060
from early 1776 "Common
Sense" galvanized opinion

00:10:47.060 --> 00:10:49.200
against the Monarchy.

00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:51.990
At the heart of this
incendiary work,

00:10:51.990 --> 00:10:54.980
Payne included a
detailed exposition

00:10:54.980 --> 00:10:58.160
from 1:Samuel:8 [assumed
spelling] in the Hebrew

00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:00.230
or Old Testament scriptures.

00:11:00.230 --> 00:11:03.710
This passage explained why
the Lord denounced Israel

00:11:03.710 --> 00:11:07.500
for requesting a king
like all the nations.

00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:09.830
Payne's reasoning
was remorseless.

00:11:09.830 --> 00:11:13.920
Surely, if God himself
repudiated the very principle

00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:18.870
of Monarchy so too should those
oppressed columnists who chafed

00:11:18.870 --> 00:11:22.150
under Britain's corrupt rule.

00:11:22.150 --> 00:11:26.750
But then with independence
secured, almost everything

00:11:26.750 --> 00:11:28.050
in the new nation was still

00:11:28.050 --> 00:11:31.990
up for grabs including general
questions about religion

00:11:31.990 --> 00:11:35.070
and specific questions
about scripture.

00:11:35.070 --> 00:11:37.900
Into that parlous
state of affairs,

00:11:37.900 --> 00:11:41.660
Payne launched a second
literary bombshell.

00:11:41.660 --> 00:11:45.140
It's title was, "The Age of
Reason Being an Investigation

00:11:45.140 --> 00:11:48.230
of True and Fabulous Theology".

00:11:48.230 --> 00:11:51.510
Payne wrote the first part of
this work published in 1794

00:11:51.510 --> 00:11:54.920
as a prisoner of the French
Revolutionary government

00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:58.760
which he had traveled to Paris
to support, but which had turned

00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:01.300
on him as it did
on so many others.

00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:04.030
He penned the second part
published the next year

00:12:04.030 --> 00:12:06.050
in England where he had come

00:12:06.050 --> 00:12:09.730
after an unexpected
rescue from the guillotine.

00:12:09.730 --> 00:12:13.090
Furious controversy
followed the publication

00:12:13.090 --> 00:12:15.810
of this second hyper
liberal protest

00:12:15.810 --> 00:12:18.490
against despotic authority.

00:12:18.490 --> 00:12:21.710
The consequences of this
controversy were momentous.

00:12:21.710 --> 00:12:23.610
It hastened the emergence

00:12:23.610 --> 00:12:26.190
of the United States
first political parties.

00:12:26.190 --> 00:12:29.690
It shaped the evolving character
of American public discourse

00:12:29.690 --> 00:12:34.620
and it directly stimulated plans
for universal primary education.

00:12:34.620 --> 00:12:37.370
It also profoundly affected
the fate of religion

00:12:37.370 --> 00:12:40.240
in the new Democratic Republic.

00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:43.650
In Payne's mind, the new
work followed inevitably

00:12:43.650 --> 00:12:46.060
from what he had
promoted before.

00:12:46.060 --> 00:12:48.750
Early in the first
part he wrote,

00:12:48.750 --> 00:12:52.270
"Soon after I published
the pamphlet 'Common Sense'

00:12:52.270 --> 00:12:56.400
in America, I saw the exceeding
probability that a revolution

00:12:56.400 --> 00:12:59.850
in a system of government would
be followed by a revolution

00:12:59.850 --> 00:13:01.230
in a system of religion'."

00:13:01.230 --> 00:13:04.610
With his great gift
for electric pros,

00:13:04.610 --> 00:13:07.200
Payne boldly advanced
this second revolution

00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:09.800
by denouncing foundational
principles

00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:13.590
of the Christian faith and
particularly tacked difference

00:13:13.590 --> 00:13:16.680
in scripture with the same
passion he had once attached

00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:21.940
subservient to King George
III of the Old Testament.

00:13:21.940 --> 00:13:24.000
Payne was utterly dismissive.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.680
Let's see if we can
get this quotation,

00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:30.240
"Whenever we read
the obscene stories,

00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:36.110
the voluptuous debaucheries, the
cruel and tortuous executions,

00:13:36.110 --> 00:13:39.230
the unrelenting vindictiveness
with which more

00:13:39.230 --> 00:13:43.040
than half the bible is filled,
it would be more consistent

00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:47.940
if we called it the word of a
demon than the word of God."

00:13:47.940 --> 00:13:51.130
As for the New Testament, you
know, Payne found much to admire

00:13:51.130 --> 00:13:52.430
in the character of Jesus.

00:13:52.430 --> 00:13:56.720
He claimed that Christian
churches have set up a system

00:13:56.720 --> 00:13:59.470
of religion very
contradictory to the character

00:13:59.470 --> 00:14:02.020
or the person whose
name it bears.

00:14:02.020 --> 00:14:05.170
Instead of childish adherence
to the Christian mythologists

00:14:05.170 --> 00:14:08.210
who by exalting scripture
had voiced at yolk

00:14:08.210 --> 00:14:11.690
of spiritual tyranny
on hapless believers,

00:14:11.690 --> 00:14:13.630
Payne proclaimed a
more excellent way.

00:14:13.630 --> 00:14:17.240
It is only by the
exercise of reason

00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:20.190
that man can discover God.

00:14:20.190 --> 00:14:23.010
Payne's vivid, demonic
prose ensured

00:14:23.010 --> 00:14:26.120
that even the most marginally
literate had grasped his

00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:27.700
central thesis.

00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:30.510
The idea of verbal regulation,

00:14:30.510 --> 00:14:33.820
the impedes [assumed spelling]
belief that God had spoken

00:14:33.820 --> 00:14:38.230
to man was the prime cause
for the bloody persecutions,

00:14:38.230 --> 00:14:41.360
and torches unto death,
and religious wars

00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:45.340
that since biblical times have
laid Europe in blood and ashes.

00:14:45.340 --> 00:14:48.060
In Britain, Payne had
already become notorious.

00:14:48.060 --> 00:14:49.360
When he attacked
monarchy, histocracy

00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:50.660
and hereditary privilege --

00:14:50.660 --> 00:14:51.960
[ Coughing ]

00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:56.470
-- in a dramatic literary
exchange with Edmond Burke

00:14:56.470 --> 00:14:59.010
over the nature of
the French Revolution.

00:14:59.010 --> 00:15:02.240
Now with the "Age of
Reason", Britain's booed.

00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:05.430
Democratic radicals
cheered even as defenders

00:15:05.430 --> 00:15:08.950
of the standing order mobilized
to slap him down once again.

00:15:08.950 --> 00:15:12.590
It was different in
the United States.

00:15:12.590 --> 00:15:15.060
When cheap copies of
Payne's work began to pour

00:15:15.060 --> 00:15:18.710
from the presses,
consternation went much deeper.

00:15:18.710 --> 00:15:20.950
Like Payne's British opponents,

00:15:20.950 --> 00:15:23.560
also rushed to defend the
truths of Christianity.

00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:27.620
Yet because the American
reaction came primarily

00:15:27.620 --> 00:15:32.430
from figures who shared many of
Payne's political principles,

00:15:32.430 --> 00:15:34.150
the result took a
different course

00:15:34.150 --> 00:15:35.830
on this side of the Atlantic.

00:15:35.830 --> 00:15:39.900
Among the many wall
hooks - you're going

00:15:39.900 --> 00:15:41.770
to earn your independence.

00:15:41.770 --> 00:15:43.070
The relationship to religion

00:15:43.070 --> 00:15:45.990
or public life was
the most uncertain.

00:15:45.990 --> 00:15:49.620
The majority of religious
disposition's a fairly narrow

00:15:49.620 --> 00:15:51.060
British cast.

00:15:51.060 --> 00:15:54.710
But even after the banishment
of the Protestant loyalists,

00:15:54.710 --> 00:15:57.390
the Protestants who remained
embraced a great range

00:15:57.390 --> 00:16:00.040
of footing religious
opinions as well

00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:03.690
as equally conflicting
positions on public issues.

00:16:03.690 --> 00:16:07.510
In addition, the new nation had
also repudiated the Christendom

00:16:07.510 --> 00:16:11.450
that had long upheld
Europe's Christian regimes.

00:16:11.450 --> 00:16:14.290
It's government at every level
now guaranteed a religious

00:16:14.290 --> 00:16:16.140
liberty for all techniques
and practices

00:16:16.140 --> 00:16:18.610
that did not endanger
the public sphere.

00:16:18.610 --> 00:16:20.880
They had in other words
achieved a state of affairs

00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:24.170
for which Payne praised
the French.

00:16:24.170 --> 00:16:25.570
With only a little ambiguity,

00:16:25.570 --> 00:16:28.800
the American states had
also forced worn government

00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:32.390
sponsorship religion or at
least the coercive establishment

00:16:32.390 --> 00:16:34.250
of only one Christian
denomination

00:16:34.250 --> 00:16:35.740
as the official Church
of the Realm.

00:16:35.740 --> 00:16:40.030
And despite much in the new
United States had fulfilled Tom

00:16:40.030 --> 00:16:42.670
Payne's ideals for true liberty,

00:16:42.670 --> 00:16:45.920
the new nation's religious
disposition opposed much

00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:48.940
that Payne so colorfully
proposed.

00:16:48.940 --> 00:16:51.070
Specifically, unlike the French,

00:16:51.070 --> 00:16:54.090
American's exhibited
very little hostility

00:16:54.090 --> 00:16:56.750
to traditional religion as such.

00:16:56.750 --> 00:17:01.400
How could they since a robust,
biblical Protestantism had

00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:05.880
so resolutely supported
the drive for independence.

00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:08.660
Hence, the question
that Americans' faced

00:17:08.660 --> 00:17:14.600
when they should show Payne and
when not European Christianity,

00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:18.760
but rather how to maintain
Christianity once the props

00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:22.810
of formal Christendom
had been kicked away.

00:17:22.810 --> 00:17:25.760
Payne's "Age of Reason"
was published in almost

00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:30.530
as many American editions
from 1794-1796 as his

00:17:30.530 --> 00:17:34.850
"Common Sense" had
been published in 1776.

00:17:34.850 --> 00:17:37.820
The great reversal
of the 1790's was

00:17:37.820 --> 00:17:41.870
that nearly universal
condemnation replaced the

00:17:41.870 --> 00:17:45.500
ferrous affirmations that had
greeted his patriotic call

00:17:45.500 --> 00:17:47.060
to arms.

00:17:47.060 --> 00:17:49.960
The nearly 70 refutations

00:17:49.960 --> 00:17:53.640
that Americans prepared
themselves are republished

00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:55.900
from Britain stimulated even

00:17:55.900 --> 00:17:59.320
as they foreshadowed
three major features

00:17:59.320 --> 00:18:03.660
of the bible's later
history in the United States.

00:18:03.660 --> 00:18:06.040
First, was an exultation
of scripture

00:18:06.040 --> 00:18:09.020
in public consciousness
that reached even higher

00:18:09.020 --> 00:18:10.450
than in earlier decades.

00:18:10.450 --> 00:18:13.820
In the new United States,
the political infrastructure

00:18:13.820 --> 00:18:18.180
that has supported the bible in
European Christendom had shrunk.

00:18:18.180 --> 00:18:20.960
While a public disposition
toward Christianity continued,

00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:22.770
the formal church state ties

00:18:22.770 --> 00:18:26.260
that officially supported
particular Christian traditions

00:18:26.260 --> 00:18:27.730
did not.

00:18:27.730 --> 00:18:31.180
That new situation with an open
religious marketplace made the

00:18:31.180 --> 00:18:35.560
near unanimity in response to
paying even more consequential

00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:39.680
than the parallel
outcry in Britain.

00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:43.390
Three or four American
publications did embrace Payne's

00:18:43.390 --> 00:18:45.270
radical deism.

00:18:45.270 --> 00:18:48.550
But the overwhelming majority
which affirms scripture

00:18:48.550 --> 00:18:51.200
as trustworthy divine
revelation came from all

00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:54.170
around the theological compass.

00:18:54.170 --> 00:18:56.110
To be sure, a majority of titles

00:18:56.110 --> 00:18:59.510
and reprinted editions were
prepared by proprietary figures.

00:18:59.510 --> 00:19:01.620
Remember it's either of
the Church of England,

00:19:01.620 --> 00:19:04.870
Church of Scotland, or in
America Congregationalists,

00:19:04.870 --> 00:19:07.460
Presbyterians, Episcopalians.

00:19:07.460 --> 00:19:09.600
Such authors tended
to view the threat

00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:12.440
of Payne's theological
hierarchy and the threat

00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:16.540
of his political radicalism
as two sides of one coin.

00:19:16.540 --> 00:19:20.130
Yet rushing to join these
traditional voices came also

00:19:20.130 --> 00:19:23.590
unitarians including
interestingly enough Joseph

00:19:23.590 --> 00:19:27.320
Priestly, the renowned
discover of oxygen, harsh critic

00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:30.710
of Britain in its standoff
with revolutionary France

00:19:30.710 --> 00:19:33.560
and friend of Thomas Jefferson.

00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:37.080
Universalists, several
Baptists, one Jew,

00:19:37.080 --> 00:19:40.850
one Sandemanian all wrote
against Payne's "Age of Reason".

00:19:40.850 --> 00:19:44.430
In other words, he
stimulated a sharper, clearer,

00:19:44.430 --> 00:19:46.310
and more widely shared
affirmation

00:19:46.310 --> 00:19:49.730
of scriptural primacy than
Americans had inherited

00:19:49.730 --> 00:19:51.790
from Protestant Europe.

00:19:51.790 --> 00:19:55.750
If the United States was
embracing liberal democratic

00:19:55.750 --> 00:20:00.590
and enlightenment principles, it
was not embracing the secularism

00:20:00.590 --> 00:20:03.010
that accompanied these
principles in Europe.

00:20:03.010 --> 00:20:04.650
[ Coughing ]

00:20:04.650 --> 00:20:05.950
The second important result

00:20:05.950 --> 00:20:08.950
of this controversy
concerned the means

00:20:08.950 --> 00:20:10.610
that Payne's opponents used

00:20:10.610 --> 00:20:14.270
to affirm the indispensability
of scripture.

00:20:14.270 --> 00:20:17.520
Consequences flowing from
the general excitement

00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:21.540
over Payne's infidelity have
been insightfully specified

00:20:21.540 --> 00:20:23.160
by Historian, Eric [inaudible].

00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:25.430
In particular, the challenge

00:20:25.430 --> 00:20:28.390
of radical deism
created the playing field

00:20:28.390 --> 00:20:31.450
on which Americans fashioned
two rules for organizing,

00:20:31.450 --> 00:20:35.560
civilizing, and directing
their new nation.

00:20:35.560 --> 00:20:38.920
Thus, the means used
to counteract Payne --

00:20:38.920 --> 00:20:42.920
pamphlets, locally organized
societies, periodicals

00:20:42.920 --> 00:20:48.280
and newspapers exalted
persuasive argumentation

00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:51.200
as the prime means that
shape pacific order.

00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:53.770
In the unfolding of the
American experience,

00:20:53.770 --> 00:20:58.190
it was no longer top down,
state guided coercion,

00:20:58.190 --> 00:21:01.100
but bottom-up citizen
directed mobilization

00:21:01.100 --> 00:21:02.650
that would shape public opinion.

00:21:02.650 --> 00:21:06.890
And if public's fear
defined by freedom of speech,

00:21:06.890 --> 00:21:11.450
the radicals well-publicized
efforts which attacked scripture

00:21:11.450 --> 00:21:15.070
as immoral and actually
dangerous had their greatest

00:21:15.070 --> 00:21:19.180
long-term a pact -- impact when
they provoked a popular rally

00:21:19.180 --> 00:21:22.810
around the opposite conviction
where the bible could be trusted

00:21:22.810 --> 00:21:25.030
as the very word of God.

00:21:25.030 --> 00:21:27.540
This way of linking
private religion

00:21:27.540 --> 00:21:31.200
and public morality created
a situation for those

00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:34.050
who would later contend over
slavery, women's rights,

00:21:34.050 --> 00:21:38.090
and temperance were forced to
pursue absolute moral claims

00:21:38.090 --> 00:21:44.290
in a political culture guided by
persuasion and public opinion.

00:21:44.290 --> 00:21:45.590
Controversy over the age

00:21:45.590 --> 00:21:48.180
of reason also anticipated
important developments

00:21:48.180 --> 00:21:49.780
in education.

00:21:49.780 --> 00:21:52.950
The broad American commitment
to a Republican understanding

00:21:52.950 --> 00:21:55.000
of the world which assumed

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:58.940
that a healthy social order
required self-directed virtuous

00:21:58.940 --> 00:22:02.650
citizens, almost inevitably
led opponents of deism

00:22:02.650 --> 00:22:07.430
to propose innovative plans
for educating all children.

00:22:07.430 --> 00:22:10.380
The overwhelming unity
that Americans displayed

00:22:10.380 --> 00:22:14.810
in defending scripture against
Payne's attacks paved the way

00:22:14.810 --> 00:22:18.610
for the Protestant sects to
subordinate their own conflicts

00:22:18.610 --> 00:22:20.760
over biblical interpretation.

00:22:20.760 --> 00:22:23.040
So, it was that when proponents

00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:26.710
of public education saw
a universally respected,

00:22:26.710 --> 00:22:31.040
but non-sectarian means of
promoting morality in schools

00:22:31.040 --> 00:22:34.250
and thereby ensuring
public well-being,

00:22:34.250 --> 00:22:35.810
their instrument
would soon be obvious.

00:22:35.810 --> 00:22:39.570
It was the King James'
version of the bible.

00:22:39.570 --> 00:22:41.500
In a word, the way
in which pone --

00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:45.010
Payne's opponents defended
the bible cut the channels

00:22:45.010 --> 00:22:48.220
in which later American
patterns of public advocacy

00:22:48.220 --> 00:22:50.700
and public education flowed.

00:22:50.700 --> 00:22:55.240
A third result -- and the most
important for the later hiss --

00:22:55.240 --> 00:22:59.120
history of the bible came from
the fact that Americans united

00:22:59.120 --> 00:23:01.940
in their defense of
scripture against the age

00:23:01.940 --> 00:23:03.880
of reason continued to differ

00:23:03.880 --> 00:23:06.360
on almost everything
else among themselves.

00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:09.970
For the history of the
bible knows the visions --

00:23:09.970 --> 00:23:13.000
knew almost as much -- as large

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:16.110
as the defense of
scripture itself.

00:23:16.110 --> 00:23:18.840
Excellent scholarship when
efforts to combat deism

00:23:18.840 --> 00:23:20.670
and fidelity or radical religion

00:23:20.670 --> 00:23:23.520
in the early American
Republic has concentrated

00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:26.640
on Payne's critics who linked
the defense of scripture

00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:30.480
to the defense of social
and political order.

00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:33.290
But two other broad
responses arose to response

00:23:33.290 --> 00:23:34.590
of "The Age of Reason".

00:23:34.590 --> 00:23:38.540
Some Americans agreed
with Payne's politics even

00:23:38.540 --> 00:23:40.830
as they abhorred his religion.

00:23:40.830 --> 00:23:44.500
And still, others ignored
Payne's politics in order

00:23:44.500 --> 00:23:48.560
to advance in our political
understanding of biblical faith.

00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:50.310
The contrast can
be oversimplified

00:23:50.310 --> 00:23:53.510
into tri-apatite [assumed
spelling] question.

00:23:53.510 --> 00:23:56.540
Did faithfully biblical
Christianity support a religion

00:23:56.540 --> 00:23:57.840
of order?

00:23:57.840 --> 00:24:02.130
Did it support a religion
of liberty or did it re -

00:24:02.130 --> 00:24:05.920
support a religion of
disinterested piety?

00:24:05.920 --> 00:24:13.200
Uzal Ogden [assumed spelling] --
not a common name in the Library

00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:16.280
of Congress - was the Episcopal
rector [assumed spelling]

00:24:16.280 --> 00:24:17.580
of Newark, New Jersey.

00:24:17.580 --> 00:24:20.870
He spoke boldly for
those who regarded Payne

00:24:20.870 --> 00:24:23.010
as primarily a threat
to public order.

00:24:23.010 --> 00:24:29.110
His massive 1790 tone
Antidote to Deism" finally got

00:24:29.110 --> 00:24:33.000
around to defending scripture
as such, but only after more

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:37.180
than 100 pages devoted
to his main concern.

00:24:37.180 --> 00:24:41.650
In proportion as a neglect he
wrote, "As a neglect or attempt

00:24:41.650 --> 00:24:44.790
of religion maintains,
dissoluteness

00:24:44.790 --> 00:24:47.680
of morals will prevail
and when a people

00:24:47.680 --> 00:24:50.940
in general become dissolute,
probing, and virtue,

00:24:50.940 --> 00:24:53.530
public spirit and generous
concern for the interests

00:24:53.530 --> 00:24:56.410
of the nation will
be extinguished."

00:24:56.410 --> 00:24:59.330
For Ogden and others like him,
the bible is most important

00:24:59.330 --> 00:25:05.290
for supplying the virtue without
which the Republic would fail.

00:25:05.290 --> 00:25:07.990
This emphasis on the
bible usually mixed

00:25:07.990 --> 00:25:11.540
with early religious concerns
decisively shaped much

00:25:11.540 --> 00:25:13.630
of later American history.

00:25:13.630 --> 00:25:16.850
It spurred the Herculean labors
of voluntary organizations

00:25:16.850 --> 00:25:19.660
like American Bible Society
and American Track Society.

00:25:19.660 --> 00:25:22.260
It inspired educational
reformers

00:25:22.260 --> 00:25:25.210
and many theological varieties
to promote daily readings

00:25:25.210 --> 00:25:29.300
of the King James version as a
mainstay of school instruction.

00:25:29.300 --> 00:25:31.370
It fed into the emergence
of the Wig Party

00:25:31.370 --> 00:25:36.120
and it would shape the efforts
of many consequential leaders

00:25:36.120 --> 00:25:38.840
like the abolitionists
Theodore Dwight [inaudible],

00:25:38.840 --> 00:25:40.140
Frances Willard, the founder

00:25:40.140 --> 00:25:42.260
of the Women's Christian
Temperance Organization

00:25:42.260 --> 00:25:44.840
and Daniel Alexander Payne

00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:48.230
of the African Methodists'
Episcopal Church.

00:25:48.230 --> 00:25:53.210
By contrast, a second group of
Payne's critics agreed with him

00:25:53.210 --> 00:25:55.540
when he attacked
political elites

00:25:55.540 --> 00:25:57.640
and traditional social
hierarchies.

00:25:57.640 --> 00:26:00.870
For them, biblical religion
supplied the fortitude

00:26:00.870 --> 00:26:03.830
to resist tyranny and corruption

00:26:03.830 --> 00:26:07.040
without which the
Republic would fail.

00:26:07.040 --> 00:26:11.000
A Virginia Baptist, Andrew
Broadus [assumed spelling] spoke

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:13.330
for this cohort when
he confessed that,

00:26:13.330 --> 00:26:17.670
"Although I am disgusted
with Payne as a religionist,

00:26:17.670 --> 00:26:21.350
I do admire Mr. Payne
as a politician."

00:26:21.350 --> 00:26:24.900
In his book, Broadus summarized
the "Age of Reason" charge --

00:26:24.900 --> 00:26:29.190
or "The Age of Reason's
charges against tyranny and vice

00:26:29.190 --> 00:26:31.310
of traditional churches,
and then said

00:26:31.310 --> 00:26:34.820
that he too abominated
national establishments,

00:26:34.820 --> 00:26:38.820
pomp and reference, published
indulgences and all the rest

00:26:38.820 --> 00:26:42.160
of what the bible is
an utter stranger too.

00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:45.260
So, it wasn't Broadus
who defended the bible,

00:26:45.260 --> 00:26:49.270
also endorsed Payne's
radical Republican approach

00:26:49.270 --> 00:26:51.470
to formal establishment
structures

00:26:51.470 --> 00:26:55.890
and informal church power which
she saw especially as exercise

00:26:55.890 --> 00:26:58.880
by American Episcopalians,
Presbyterians

00:26:58.880 --> 00:27:01.170
and Congregationalists.

00:27:01.170 --> 00:27:03.950
With the influence of
Baptist convictions like those

00:27:03.950 --> 00:27:05.770
at Broadus, a growing
number willing

00:27:05.770 --> 00:27:09.690
to go further attacking any
kind of hierarchy, the emphasis

00:27:09.690 --> 00:27:11.250
of those that have posed Payne

00:27:11.250 --> 00:27:13.880
as a religionist
while following him

00:27:13.880 --> 00:27:17.390
as a politician was
destined to grow.

00:27:17.390 --> 00:27:20.680
Such ones would go on to
impact the reforming ambitions

00:27:20.680 --> 00:27:22.490
of national voluntary
organizations

00:27:22.490 --> 00:27:24.730
like the American Bible Society.

00:27:24.730 --> 00:27:28.010
They would lien strongly to the
Democratic Party, Andrew Jackson

00:27:28.010 --> 00:27:32.460
and its insistence of a local
control over local institutions.

00:27:32.460 --> 00:27:34.430
But ironically in
an extreme form,

00:27:34.430 --> 00:27:37.710
this kind of criticism
also infused the work

00:27:37.710 --> 00:27:41.740
of David Walker's 1829
appealed to the colored citizens

00:27:41.740 --> 00:27:45.570
of the world which level a
thoroughly biblical critique

00:27:45.570 --> 00:27:48.460
against slavery and the
national institutions

00:27:48.460 --> 00:27:51.420
that supported the slave system.

00:27:51.420 --> 00:27:53.780
Critics of Payne in
other words who wanted

00:27:53.780 --> 00:27:57.360
to defend the bible became
critics of each other

00:27:57.360 --> 00:27:58.820
when they used the bible

00:27:58.820 --> 00:28:01.160
to defend conflicting
interpretations

00:28:01.160 --> 00:28:04.310
of Republic well-being.

00:28:04.310 --> 00:28:07.730
The third group of Payne's
critics has received less

00:28:07.730 --> 00:28:11.070
attention in part because they
did not want to have anything

00:28:11.070 --> 00:28:15.400
to do with politics, but rather
hope to preserve the scripture

00:28:15.400 --> 00:28:17.770
in a strictly religious book.

00:28:17.770 --> 00:28:21.880
Such ones included David
Levy, a New York City Jew

00:28:21.880 --> 00:28:23.340
for whom the text quoted

00:28:23.340 --> 00:28:27.400
on his title page summarized
the entirety of his argument

00:28:27.400 --> 00:28:29.130
against "The Age of Reason".

00:28:29.130 --> 00:28:32.130
"The fool hath said in
his heart there is no God

00:28:32.130 --> 00:28:36.010
and the wicked worketh a
deceitful work" both quoted

00:28:36.010 --> 00:28:38.840
incidentally from the
King James version.

00:28:38.840 --> 00:28:41.330
Similarly, David Humphries --

00:28:41.330 --> 00:28:45.040
a Yale graduate and well-known
New Hampshire lawyer --

00:28:45.040 --> 00:28:49.300
spent most of his attack
on Payne attacking those

00:28:49.300 --> 00:28:52.410
who viewed Payne as
a political threat.

00:28:52.410 --> 00:28:55.540
Humphries -- a follower of
the Sandemanian sect imported

00:28:55.540 --> 00:28:59.790
from Scotland -- wanted an
absolute divide between religion

00:28:59.790 --> 00:29:02.130
and anything corporately
perfect.

00:29:02.130 --> 00:29:05.430
His stance moved him closer
to the anti-Payne-ites

00:29:05.430 --> 00:29:07.470
who denounced American efforts

00:29:07.470 --> 00:29:10.120
and created informal
Christendom's

00:29:10.120 --> 00:29:13.110
to replace the formal
Christendom's of Europe.

00:29:13.110 --> 00:29:15.590
But Humphries main
concern was not the future

00:29:15.590 --> 00:29:19.290
of the American public, but
as he put it "the honor of God

00:29:19.290 --> 00:29:22.390
and His saving truth".

00:29:22.390 --> 00:29:23.690
The way that David Levi

00:29:23.690 --> 00:29:26.430
and David Humphries defended
scripture would also have a

00:29:26.430 --> 00:29:28.450
consequential future.

00:29:28.450 --> 00:29:31.640
It was a stance their great
contemporary Francis Asberry

00:29:31.640 --> 00:29:33.740
[assumed spelling] whose
single-minded devotion

00:29:33.740 --> 00:29:37.610
to the salvation of souls made
early American Methodism the

00:29:37.610 --> 00:29:41.880
most effective means of church
creation in American History.

00:29:41.880 --> 00:29:44.600
Could it also be the
stance of some Baptists?

00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:47.750
Some in the Disciples of Christ
Christian Church tradition,

00:29:47.750 --> 00:29:51.070
many among the Adventists,
and some in later High Church,

00:29:51.070 --> 00:29:53.130
Pentecostal and fundamentalist
movements.

00:29:53.130 --> 00:29:56.780
It would guide the noteworthy
service of African Americans

00:29:56.780 --> 00:29:58.080
like Richard Allen
[assumed spelling],

00:29:58.080 --> 00:30:00.040
Harriet Jacob, and Amanda Smith.

00:30:00.040 --> 00:30:03.360
It was also close to
the sentiments expressed

00:30:03.360 --> 00:30:06.030
by Abraham Lincoln when
he referenced the bible

00:30:06.030 --> 00:30:09.080
in his second inaugural address.

00:30:09.080 --> 00:30:11.770
IN summary, responses
to Tom Payne's "Age

00:30:11.770 --> 00:30:15.270
of Reason" are almost as
important for the unfolding

00:30:15.270 --> 00:30:18.160
of American History as
the influence of Payne's

00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:22.280
"Common Sense" had been for
the beginning of that history.

00:30:22.280 --> 00:30:25.560
These responses insured that
the bible would remain an object

00:30:25.560 --> 00:30:28.280
in merely universal respect.

00:30:28.280 --> 00:30:32.820
They defined how religion would
relate to American public life.

00:30:32.820 --> 00:30:37.220
And in their diversity these
responses also anticipated the

00:30:37.220 --> 00:30:41.310
major fissures among the
many groups that could agree

00:30:41.310 --> 00:30:46.060
with Elias [inaudible],
friend of George Washington,

00:30:46.060 --> 00:30:49.980
President of the Confederation
Congress, founding President

00:30:49.980 --> 00:30:51.490
of the American Bible Society

00:30:51.490 --> 00:30:56.310
and dedicated Presbyterian
laymen who in his large response

00:30:56.310 --> 00:31:00.700
to Payne called the bible
simply the most valuable book

00:31:00.700 --> 00:31:03.000
in the world.

00:31:04.510 --> 00:31:14.510
[ Applause ]

00:31:14.510 --> 00:31:28.680
[ Background noise ]

00:31:28.680 --> 00:31:30.030
&gt;&gt; Paul Gutjahr: Okay.

00:31:30.030 --> 00:31:31.500
Are we on?

00:31:31.500 --> 00:31:34.590
Okay. Good afternoon.

00:31:34.590 --> 00:31:35.960
Thank you for all coming today.

00:31:35.960 --> 00:31:41.090
I wanted to say if you can't
see a screen for this talk,

00:31:41.090 --> 00:31:44.980
you may want to move to a place
where you can see a screen

00:31:44.980 --> 00:31:47.480
because there's some
really nice pictures

00:31:47.480 --> 00:31:49.130
of Noah's Ark coming up, so.

00:31:49.130 --> 00:31:51.250
[ Laughter ]

00:31:51.250 --> 00:31:53.780
I'd also like to thank Dan
[inaudible] and Mark Nowell

00:31:53.780 --> 00:31:59.900
for putting this panel together.

00:32:07.480 --> 00:32:11.960
Okay. Going to begin today by
talking a little bit about the

00:32:11.960 --> 00:32:14.570
"Oxford Handbook of the
Bible in America" --

00:32:14.570 --> 00:32:18.280
a volume which I edited and
was released last September.

00:32:18.280 --> 00:32:21.050
The 700 page volume took
four years to complete

00:32:21.050 --> 00:32:25.390
and involves some 45 scholars
writing on various aspects

00:32:25.390 --> 00:32:26.770
of the bible in America.

00:32:26.770 --> 00:32:32.000
In the end, these scholars
produced 42 chapters

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:37.890
on a wide variety of topics
-- the bible and politics,

00:32:37.890 --> 00:32:41.400
the bible and African Americans,
the bible and art, the bible

00:32:41.400 --> 00:32:44.140
and preaching, and the
list goes on, and on.

00:32:44.140 --> 00:32:45.440
And one of the fascinating
things

00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:48.360
about editing a collection of
essays like this one is the way

00:32:48.360 --> 00:32:53.330
in which you have to
read, reread, re-reread,

00:32:53.330 --> 00:32:58.340
often help rewrite various
essays and that gives ones --

00:32:58.340 --> 00:33:01.540
one a bird's eye view
of the topic as a whole.

00:33:01.540 --> 00:33:03.700
And in so doing, allowing one

00:33:03.700 --> 00:33:06.640
to see how many different
chapters often speak

00:33:06.640 --> 00:33:10.070
to one another.

00:33:10.070 --> 00:33:15.930
I would like to spend my
time today with you talking

00:33:15.930 --> 00:33:19.010
about just one set of
connections that became apparent

00:33:19.010 --> 00:33:20.830
to me as I edited
this collection.

00:33:20.830 --> 00:33:24.690
Namely just how present
the trope of Noah's Ark is

00:33:24.690 --> 00:33:27.450
when it comes to the bible
and American culture.

00:33:27.450 --> 00:33:33.000
I will spend my remaining
time speaking briefly

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:35.360
about five moments in
American history and culture

00:33:35.360 --> 00:33:38.480
where the biblical story of
Noah's Ark has had a presence

00:33:38.480 --> 00:33:41.870
in how the bible has been
used, viewed and interpreted

00:33:41.870 --> 00:33:45.650
over the past 300
years in America.

00:33:45.650 --> 00:33:50.130
The first moment
involves children's bibles

00:33:50.130 --> 00:33:51.540
in the United States.

00:33:51.540 --> 00:33:53.120
Not surprisingly, the story

00:33:53.120 --> 00:33:55.820
of Noah's Ark plays an
absolutely central role

00:33:55.820 --> 00:34:00.020
in how the bible was redacted
and simplified for children.

00:34:00.020 --> 00:34:01.950
In fact, the story
of Noah's Ark is one

00:34:01.950 --> 00:34:04.190
of the most commonly
included bible stories

00:34:04.190 --> 00:34:06.470
in bible editions
specifically created

00:34:06.470 --> 00:34:08.620
and marketed to children.

00:34:08.620 --> 00:34:11.380
Just one of the interesting
facets of the Noah's Ark story

00:34:11.380 --> 00:34:13.120
in such bibles is
how the emphasis

00:34:13.120 --> 00:34:15.500
of the story has changed
over three centuries

00:34:15.500 --> 00:34:18.040
of American Children's
bible editions.

00:34:18.040 --> 00:34:23.690
When the story of Noah and
his ark was told in the 18th

00:34:23.690 --> 00:34:26.810
and 19th Century, children
bibles, it was a tale

00:34:26.810 --> 00:34:29.820
that concentrated on the
wickedness of men, and women,

00:34:29.820 --> 00:34:32.580
and often used pictures of
people being left behind

00:34:32.580 --> 00:34:34.910
to die outside the ark.

00:34:34.910 --> 00:34:37.630
The emphasis was on the
plight of the wicked

00:34:37.630 --> 00:34:39.290
and the righteousness
of God's wrath

00:34:39.290 --> 00:34:43.340
as he punished those
wicked people.

00:34:43.340 --> 00:34:46.340
Matching this emphasis, the most
common illustration accompanying

00:34:46.340 --> 00:34:48.250
the story of Noah's Ark in
the 19th Century edition

00:34:48.250 --> 00:34:51.870
of bible editions was
Gustave Dore's "The Deluge"

00:34:51.870 --> 00:34:53.820
which depicts young
children on a mountaintop

00:34:53.820 --> 00:34:57.210
about to be overcome
by flood waters.

00:34:57.210 --> 00:34:58.770
The lesson to children
was clear.

00:34:58.770 --> 00:35:00.500
Be good.

00:35:00.500 --> 00:35:02.920
[ Laughter ]

00:35:02.920 --> 00:35:06.410
Be obedient to God's commands
or suffer the consequences.

00:35:06.410 --> 00:35:10.940
As one 1831 bible version
stated, "Oh, how dreadful it is

00:35:10.940 --> 00:35:15.870
to dissipate -- disobey such
a powerful God who can destroy

00:35:15.870 --> 00:35:18.990
in a moment if he please."

00:35:18.990 --> 00:35:24.560
By the end of the 20th Century,
the main point of the Noah story

00:35:24.560 --> 00:35:28.330
in children's bible editions was
something very different indeed.

00:35:28.330 --> 00:35:29.880
Instead of a prod
toward obedience

00:35:29.880 --> 00:35:32.230
and a nod toward
God's vengeful power,

00:35:32.230 --> 00:35:35.060
these bibles portrayed a God
who is friendly and an --

00:35:35.060 --> 00:35:37.750
and is intent on
keeping children safe

00:35:37.750 --> 00:35:39.910
from things such as floods.

00:35:39.910 --> 00:35:42.740
In these editions, Noah's Ark
is often pictured chalk full

00:35:42.740 --> 00:35:45.660
of animals without
humans even being present.

00:35:45.660 --> 00:35:47.080
When Noah does appear,

00:35:47.080 --> 00:35:49.570
he is often portrayed
comically interacting

00:35:49.570 --> 00:35:53.020
with his animal friends
or smiling at his readers.

00:35:53.020 --> 00:35:56.330
The message here is not one
of obedience in God's wrath,

00:35:56.330 --> 00:36:00.400
but playfulness in
God's kindness.

00:36:00.400 --> 00:36:06.220
Let us move on to our
second Ark moment.

00:36:06.220 --> 00:36:08.230
This time I turn
to American art.

00:36:08.230 --> 00:36:10.350
Focus this discussion,
we will look

00:36:10.350 --> 00:36:13.200
at the early 19th Century
folk painter and Quaker,

00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:15.090
Edward Hicks [assumed spelling].

00:36:15.090 --> 00:36:17.910
Hicks is most famous
for his 62 variations

00:36:17.910 --> 00:36:19.390
of "The Peaceable Kingdom".

00:36:19.390 --> 00:36:21.970
Renditions on the Isiah
Messianic [assumed spelling]

00:36:21.970 --> 00:36:25.270
were the lion facedown
with the lamb.

00:36:27.010 --> 00:36:31.470
Hicks did however, paint his
own version of Noah's Ark

00:36:31.470 --> 00:36:33.420
and he based it on a lithograph

00:36:33.420 --> 00:36:34.860
by Nathaniel Currier
[assumed spelling]

00:36:34.860 --> 00:36:39.180
of Currier &amp; Ives fame -- and
also of animals found in many

00:36:39.180 --> 00:36:45.750
of the children's picture
bibles of the time.

00:36:45.750 --> 00:36:48.550
Hicks however, took
the Currier lithograph

00:36:48.550 --> 00:36:51.050
and changed it in
various respects.

00:36:51.050 --> 00:36:53.650
He thinned the herd of
animals and focused the action

00:36:53.650 --> 00:36:56.800
with such touches as having the
lion directly engage the viewer

00:36:56.800 --> 00:36:58.100
as he marches to the ark.

00:36:58.100 --> 00:37:01.560
But perhaps the most
interesting change can be found

00:37:01.560 --> 00:37:03.740
in the background
of the two pictures.

00:37:03.740 --> 00:37:06.120
Currier's lithograph
portrayed the art with the

00:37:06.120 --> 00:37:08.450
to be expected Middle
Eastern domed buildings

00:37:08.450 --> 00:37:11.270
in the background.

00:37:11.270 --> 00:37:13.060
Hicks does something
revolutionary

00:37:13.060 --> 00:37:15.120
in his portrayal of the ark.

00:37:15.120 --> 00:37:18.090
He puts a New England
town in the background.

00:37:18.090 --> 00:37:20.680
Some have argued that
he has placed the Ark

00:37:20.680 --> 00:37:23.860
in Boston Harbor itself.

00:37:23.860 --> 00:37:26.230
In Hicks' painting, Noah and the
animals are seen entering the

00:37:26.230 --> 00:37:28.990
ark in order to flee
the wrath to come,

00:37:28.990 --> 00:37:30.930
but Hicks' painting
is a commentary

00:37:30.930 --> 00:37:33.430
on a disappointing America.

00:37:33.430 --> 00:37:36.990
His Noah's Ark painting of
1846 comes at the same time

00:37:36.990 --> 00:37:40.350
that his peaceful kingdom
paintings are also changing.

00:37:40.350 --> 00:37:42.730
His lions in these pictures
become more decrepit,

00:37:42.730 --> 00:37:45.370
and his animals are separated,
and no longer huddling

00:37:45.370 --> 00:37:47.560
as peacefully together.

00:37:47.560 --> 00:37:49.950
Hicks is undergoing
grave doubts period

00:37:49.950 --> 00:37:52.230
about the future
of this country.

00:37:52.230 --> 00:37:55.660
Two issues of much concern
to Quakers such as himself --

00:37:55.660 --> 00:37:58.240
the displacement and poor
treatment of Native Americans

00:37:58.240 --> 00:38:00.280
and the evils of slavery --

00:38:00.280 --> 00:38:03.850
fill much of Hicks' pessimistic
outlook at this time.

00:38:03.850 --> 00:38:06.630
The Quakers themselves are
also experiencing significant

00:38:06.630 --> 00:38:10.410
doctrinal strife in their
own ranks in this period.

00:38:10.410 --> 00:38:12.110
The once promised
peace of people

00:38:12.110 --> 00:38:14.560
like William Penn
has seemingly receded

00:38:14.560 --> 00:38:18.700
into the background making Hicks
wonder just how promising the

00:38:18.700 --> 00:38:21.270
supposedly promise
land of America was.

00:38:21.270 --> 00:38:25.320
Hicks own doubt about his
country and his hatred

00:38:25.320 --> 00:38:29.150
of slavery points to the rising
power of contradictory theories

00:38:29.150 --> 00:38:30.450
of race circulating

00:38:30.450 --> 00:38:33.010
in the United States
before the Civil War.

00:38:33.010 --> 00:38:34.310
[ Coughing ]

00:38:34.310 --> 00:38:36.790
As the hotly contested
issue of slavery came

00:38:36.790 --> 00:38:39.150
to an ever more fervent
boil in the years leading

00:38:39.150 --> 00:38:41.800
up to the Civil War,
a host of proponents

00:38:41.800 --> 00:38:44.050
of slavery articulated
their beliefs

00:38:44.050 --> 00:38:47.380
with ever more sophisticated
arguments from the bible.

00:38:47.380 --> 00:38:52.650
A key text in this regard came
from Noah's story in Genesis.

00:38:52.650 --> 00:38:58.630
"And Noah began to be a husband
and he planted a vineyard.

00:38:58.630 --> 00:39:01.090
And he drank wine
and was drunken.

00:39:01.090 --> 00:39:04.200
And he was uncovered
within his tent.

00:39:04.200 --> 00:39:05.500
And Ham [assumed spelling] --

00:39:05.500 --> 00:39:06.800
the father of Cainon [assumed
spelling] then saw the nakedness

00:39:06.800 --> 00:39:09.050
of his father and told
his two brethren without.

00:39:09.050 --> 00:39:11.470
And Shem and Japheth [assumed
spelling] took a garment,

00:39:11.470 --> 00:39:13.640
and laid it upon their
shoulders, and went backward,

00:39:13.640 --> 00:39:15.470
and covered the nakedness
of their father.

00:39:15.470 --> 00:39:17.190
And their faces were backward

00:39:17.190 --> 00:39:20.030
and they saw not their
father's nakedness.

00:39:20.030 --> 00:39:21.940
And Noah awake from his wine

00:39:21.940 --> 00:39:24.280
and he knew what his
younger son had done to him.

00:39:24.280 --> 00:39:27.430
And he said, "Cursed be Cainon.

00:39:27.430 --> 00:39:31.540
A servant of servants shall
he be unto his brethren."

00:39:31.540 --> 00:39:33.930
He said, "Blessed
be the Lord of Shem

00:39:33.930 --> 00:39:36.930
and Cainon shall be his servant.

00:39:36.930 --> 00:39:39.360
God shall enlarge jewfish

00:39:39.360 --> 00:39:41.790
and he shall dwell
in the tents of Shem.

00:39:41.790 --> 00:39:46.150
And Cainon shall
be his servant."

00:39:46.150 --> 00:39:49.130
The pivotal point here is
that Noah curses his son,

00:39:49.130 --> 00:39:51.940
Ham and all of Ham's
descendants.

00:39:51.940 --> 00:39:54.160
Many biblical scholars
also declared

00:39:54.160 --> 00:39:57.590
that the cursed dark skin
of Ham forever marking him

00:39:57.590 --> 00:39:59.000
and his descendants in a way

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:02.540
that would underline their
darker hearts and their destiny

00:40:02.540 --> 00:40:04.960
of servitude to the more
light skinned descendants

00:40:04.960 --> 00:40:07.250
of Jeffith and Shem.

00:40:07.250 --> 00:40:09.200
The Pro-slavery reasoning
for Noah's curse

00:40:09.200 --> 00:40:11.640
on Ham has a long history.

00:40:11.640 --> 00:40:15.050
In this history, usually
sexual themes dominate.

00:40:15.050 --> 00:40:16.350
These theories have ranged

00:40:16.350 --> 00:40:19.120
from Ham sexually
molesting his father --

00:40:19.120 --> 00:40:22.110
he knew what his younger
son had done to him --

00:40:22.110 --> 00:40:26.650
to a willful violation of Noah's
policy of celibacy on the ark.

00:40:26.650 --> 00:40:29.780
Southerners extend Ham's
sin to the heinous acts

00:40:29.780 --> 00:40:32.840
of achillea [assumed spelling]
disrespect - a respect that Shem

00:40:32.840 --> 00:40:35.790
and Jeffith clearly show
to their father, Noah.

00:40:35.790 --> 00:40:40.100
According to such reasoning, Ham
was not only a sexual reprobate,

00:40:40.100 --> 00:40:42.610
he was a man without honor --

00:40:42.610 --> 00:40:44.040
a terrible accusation

00:40:44.040 --> 00:40:48.080
in the honor-based
culture of the south.

00:40:49.210 --> 00:40:52.320
The fourth moment I would
like us to look at today is

00:40:52.320 --> 00:40:54.200
of a more recent vintage.

00:40:54.200 --> 00:40:57.420
The colossal art
constructed as a centerpiece

00:40:57.420 --> 00:40:58.720
of an amusement park

00:40:58.720 --> 00:41:02.310
and religious pilgrimage
location in northern Kentucky.

00:41:02.310 --> 00:41:06.560
Set on 800 acres 40 miles
south of Cincinnati, Ohio,

00:41:06.560 --> 00:41:09.760
the park's centerpiece
is an all-wooden built

00:41:09.760 --> 00:41:12.950
to scale reproduction
of Noah's Ark.

00:41:12.950 --> 00:41:14.870
Built to the specifications
outlined

00:41:14.870 --> 00:41:18.330
in the text of Genesis 6:9.

00:41:18.330 --> 00:41:22.250
At a cost of $172
million, the park known

00:41:22.250 --> 00:41:26.530
as Ark Encounter
opened in July 2016.

00:41:26.530 --> 00:41:29.240
The ark itself required
nearly four million total feet

00:41:29.240 --> 00:41:30.540
of timber.

00:41:30.540 --> 00:41:36.250
It stands 51 feet tall, 510
feet long and 85 feet wide.

00:41:36.250 --> 00:41:38.830
It contains more than
$100,000 spare feet

00:41:38.830 --> 00:41:41.580
of theme and living space.

00:41:44.650 --> 00:41:46.760
It's important to note
that Ark Encounter's

00:41:46.760 --> 00:41:49.310
from the first biblical
museum are a biblically themed

00:41:49.310 --> 00:41:51.710
entertainment park fund
in the United States

00:41:51.710 --> 00:41:53.060
or in American History.

00:41:53.060 --> 00:41:55.050
It is simply one of
many such locations --

00:41:55.050 --> 00:41:58.230
-- including some dozen
creation museums plotted

00:41:58.230 --> 00:42:00.170
around the country.

00:42:00.170 --> 00:42:02.370
Ark Encounter also
bears some similarities

00:42:02.370 --> 00:42:05.370
to the Holy Land experience
edification park in Orlando,

00:42:05.370 --> 00:42:08.890
Florida where visitors are able
to walk the streets of Jerusalem

00:42:08.890 --> 00:42:12.440
and even eat at The
Last Supper with Jesus.

00:42:14.020 --> 00:42:15.810
Ark Encounter is a sister park

00:42:15.810 --> 00:42:19.590
to the Creation Museum located
roughly five miles to its north.

00:42:19.590 --> 00:42:23.280
Both museums were spearheaded by
the famous biblical apologist,

00:42:23.280 --> 00:42:24.650
Ken Hamm [assumed spelling].

00:42:24.650 --> 00:42:26.850
An Australian born
speaker and scholar

00:42:26.850 --> 00:42:28.950
who has built a worldwide
reputation

00:42:28.950 --> 00:42:30.860
for defending literal
interpretations

00:42:30.860 --> 00:42:32.840
of the biblical text.

00:42:32.840 --> 00:42:35.830
Both museums stress an
immersive experience focused

00:42:35.830 --> 00:42:38.800
on providing sophisticated
apologetic frameworks

00:42:38.800 --> 00:42:41.380
for stories found in the bible.

00:42:41.380 --> 00:42:43.930
Arc Encounter addresses
the plausibility

00:42:43.930 --> 00:42:47.410
of Noah's mighty ark being able
to carry all the animals found

00:42:47.410 --> 00:42:50.600
in creation and help them
to survive the flood.

00:42:50.600 --> 00:42:53.770
It perukes of what one
might call a common sense

00:42:53.770 --> 00:42:56.210
experimental apologetic.

00:42:56.210 --> 00:42:59.500
Such an apologetic approach
reaches all the way back

00:42:59.500 --> 00:43:00.800
to the 19th Century in America

00:43:00.800 --> 00:43:02.380
when the congregational
theologian,

00:43:02.380 --> 00:43:04.330
Edward Robinson spent much

00:43:04.330 --> 00:43:06.550
of his career mapping
the land of Judah.

00:43:06.550 --> 00:43:09.170
While us contemporaries
argued over issues

00:43:09.170 --> 00:43:12.680
of biblical chronology,
theology and historicity,

00:43:12.680 --> 00:43:16.930
Robinson emphasized the actual
existence of the Holy Land.

00:43:16.930 --> 00:43:19.310
The very existence of
such sites is the town

00:43:19.310 --> 00:43:21.170
of Bethlehem and
the River Jordan.

00:43:21.170 --> 00:43:24.230
It still has evidence
that the bible was true

00:43:24.230 --> 00:43:28.050
and the events recorded
in it actually took place.

00:43:28.050 --> 00:43:31.310
Our encounter calls upon the
same type of argumentation

00:43:31.310 --> 00:43:34.680
by using a full-scale
replica of the ark to testify

00:43:34.680 --> 00:43:38.200
to the plausibility of Noah's
journey and saving action.

00:43:38.200 --> 00:43:40.550
And in so doing, argues
for the plausibility

00:43:40.550 --> 00:43:42.370
of the bible itself.

00:43:42.370 --> 00:43:45.300
Both Edward Robinson and
Ken Hamm are interested

00:43:45.300 --> 00:43:49.660
in bringing elements of the Holy
Land to America and in so doing,

00:43:49.660 --> 00:43:51.700
showing the truth of the bible.

00:43:51.700 --> 00:43:57.130
Finally, I wanted to touch upon
another aspect of the presence

00:43:57.130 --> 00:43:59.750
of Noah's Ark in
American biblical culture.

00:43:59.750 --> 00:44:04.750
In this case, I wanted to look
at how Noah's Ark is a metaphor

00:44:04.750 --> 00:44:06.470
and a troupe that is
seen throughout much

00:44:06.470 --> 00:44:08.690
of American religious history.

00:44:08.690 --> 00:44:13.870
Just one case of this can
be seen in the preaching

00:44:13.870 --> 00:44:16.360
of the famous 19th Century
publisher, evangelist

00:44:16.360 --> 00:44:19.220
and educator, Dwight L. Moody.

00:44:19.220 --> 00:44:23.110
Many know of Moody because of
one of his most famous sayings,

00:44:23.110 --> 00:44:26.070
"I look upon the world
as a wrecked vessel.

00:44:26.070 --> 00:44:28.170
God has given me a
lifeboat and said,

00:44:28.170 --> 00:44:31.610
'Moody, save all you can'."

00:44:31.610 --> 00:44:34.470
Here the world is
awash in sin and Moody

00:44:34.470 --> 00:44:38.400
in Noah-like fashion is bent
on getting all that he can

00:44:38.400 --> 00:44:40.010
into his lifeboat
with him to save him.

00:44:40.010 --> 00:44:41.810
[ Coughing ]

00:44:41.810 --> 00:44:44.850
[ Door opens and shuts ]

00:44:44.850 --> 00:44:47.710
Moody often returned to
Noah's Ark in his preaching

00:44:47.710 --> 00:44:49.930
and speaking about how
to raise Godly children.

00:44:49.930 --> 00:44:51.230
He told his congregation,

00:44:51.230 --> 00:44:54.810
"Every one of our children
can be brought into the ark

00:44:54.810 --> 00:44:57.140
if we pray and work earnestly."

00:44:57.140 --> 00:45:01.910
And in a famous evangelistic
sermon he delivered countless

00:45:01.910 --> 00:45:04.690
times in his many
visits to England,

00:45:04.690 --> 00:45:07.600
Moody explained his
experience by bringing

00:45:07.600 --> 00:45:09.600
that experience to Noah's Ark.

00:45:09.600 --> 00:45:12.480
I understand it now.

00:45:12.480 --> 00:45:13.940
Christ is the ark.

00:45:13.940 --> 00:45:17.660
He saves me and I
must get inside.

00:45:18.810 --> 00:45:22.410
The self-[inaudible] trope
and those are a wide array

00:45:22.410 --> 00:45:25.300
of American religious
traditions including the Mormon.

00:45:25.300 --> 00:45:27.310
The first book in the Book
of Mormon tells the tale

00:45:27.310 --> 00:45:30.740
of a righteous Jew by the
name of Levi - a revelation

00:45:30.740 --> 00:45:35.310
about around 600 BC from the
Lord that you hear so much

00:45:35.310 --> 00:45:36.900
about to be destroyed.

00:45:36.900 --> 00:45:40.370
He fled into the wilderness with
his family and with his family,

00:45:40.370 --> 00:45:44.690
he eventually built a giant boat
and sailed it on a long journey

00:45:44.690 --> 00:45:48.270
to the western hemisphere
founding a new civilization

00:45:48.270 --> 00:45:53.540
there in such a fashion
another ark saved human kind.

00:45:53.540 --> 00:45:57.220
What I've tried to do
today is show just a little

00:45:57.220 --> 00:45:59.900
of what I've learned about while
editing "The Oxford Handbook

00:45:59.900 --> 00:46:03.750
on the Bible in America" -- a
volume that I decided to grace

00:46:03.750 --> 00:46:06.260
with a cover of Noah's Ark.

00:46:06.260 --> 00:46:10.050
The story of the - of Noah and
his ark is an oft repeated trope

00:46:10.050 --> 00:46:13.370
in Christianity showing up and
it's everything from paintings,

00:46:13.370 --> 00:46:14.670
to bilateral administrations
[assumed spelling],

00:46:14.670 --> 00:46:17.050
to social theories,
to preaching.

00:46:17.050 --> 00:46:20.100
In many ways, it is
an ancient story.

00:46:20.100 --> 00:46:22.710
It is a story that an
American never seem

00:46:22.710 --> 00:46:26.510
to tire of making new.

00:46:26.510 --> 00:46:50.550
[ Applause ]

00:46:50.550 --> 00:46:53.340
&gt;&gt; Valerie Cooper:
Good afternoon.

00:46:55.070 --> 00:47:00.190
It is a hard truth, but
one that must be faced.

00:47:00.190 --> 00:47:03.330
African Americans are a
people who were created

00:47:03.330 --> 00:47:05.990
by the Atlantic Slave Trade.

00:47:05.990 --> 00:47:09.530
There were Africans and
there were Americans.

00:47:09.530 --> 00:47:13.790
But Africans in the Americas
mostly arrived on these shores

00:47:13.790 --> 00:47:16.340
after having passed
through the middle passage

00:47:16.340 --> 00:47:22.120
as through a terrible womb still
wearing the bloody afterbirth

00:47:22.120 --> 00:47:25.520
of their singular
creation as a people.

00:47:25.520 --> 00:47:28.340
In the main, Africans were
brought to the America's

00:47:28.340 --> 00:47:31.430
to serve in chains and
degradation a system

00:47:31.430 --> 00:47:33.310
that defined them as
chattel [assumed spelling],

00:47:33.310 --> 00:47:35.310
not human beings.

00:47:35.310 --> 00:47:38.340
As "Lift Every Voice
and Sing" --

00:47:38.340 --> 00:47:41.170
the so-called Negro
National Anthem puts it --

00:47:41.170 --> 00:47:46.380
"We have come over a way that
with tears has been watered.

00:47:46.380 --> 00:47:48.350
We have come treading our path

00:47:48.350 --> 00:47:52.160
through the blood
of the slaughter."

00:47:52.160 --> 00:47:55.060
Even as Africans in the
Americas, were being introduced

00:47:55.060 --> 00:47:59.300
to slavery, many were also
being introduced to the bible.

00:47:59.300 --> 00:48:02.490
Indeed, for many, the bible
became this central tool

00:48:02.490 --> 00:48:05.750
in the battle for
freedom in the New World.

00:48:05.750 --> 00:48:10.380
In "The Talking Book: African
Americans and the Bible",

00:48:10.380 --> 00:48:14.440
Allen Callahan wrote, "African
Americans are the children

00:48:14.440 --> 00:48:19.610
of slavery in America and the
bible -- as no other book --

00:48:19.610 --> 00:48:23.770
is the book of slavery's
children."

00:48:23.770 --> 00:48:26.690
From its New Testament -- from
its Old Testament narratives

00:48:26.690 --> 00:48:29.770
about freeing the Israelites
from slavery in Egypt

00:48:29.770 --> 00:48:33.380
to its New Testament teachings
about freeing the believer

00:48:33.380 --> 00:48:36.860
from slavery to sin, the
bible makes deliverance

00:48:36.860 --> 00:48:40.440
from slavery one of
its central themes.

00:48:40.440 --> 00:48:43.310
For African Americans,
the question remained,

00:48:43.310 --> 00:48:45.780
"How can we be recognized
in the fullness

00:48:45.780 --> 00:48:49.010
of our humanity however
degrading our condition

00:48:49.010 --> 00:48:50.310
as slaves -- "

00:48:50.310 --> 00:48:51.960
[ Coughing ]

00:48:51.960 --> 00:48:54.640
" -- however terrible
our birth as a people."

00:48:54.640 --> 00:48:57.740
One way they sought to define
themselves as fully human was

00:48:57.740 --> 00:48:59.530
through an appeal to scripture.

00:48:59.530 --> 00:49:02.660
Again, and again, during this
period and into the presence --

00:49:02.660 --> 00:49:06.920
present, scripture continued
to be defined as that

00:49:06.920 --> 00:49:10.310
which affirmed black
people's humanity.

00:49:10.310 --> 00:49:12.260
From the earliest
slave narratives

00:49:12.260 --> 00:49:14.800
to the more recent work
of liberation theologians

00:49:14.800 --> 00:49:16.100
like James Cohen
[assumed spelling]

00:49:16.100 --> 00:49:19.110
and Kelly Brown-Douglas,
African Americans have argued

00:49:19.110 --> 00:49:22.950
that scripture is that which
declares God to be a liberator

00:49:22.950 --> 00:49:28.690
and African Americans as
people deserving of liberation.

00:49:28.690 --> 00:49:32.350
God is never understood
as an abstract concept,

00:49:32.350 --> 00:49:37.750
but rather always seen in
relation to the people of God --

00:49:37.750 --> 00:49:39.170
people like the downtrodden

00:49:39.170 --> 00:49:42.840
and oppressed Africans
in the America's.

00:49:42.840 --> 00:49:45.950
The history of African
Americans and their encounters

00:49:45.950 --> 00:49:48.040
with slavery, with racism,

00:49:48.040 --> 00:49:51.690
with oppression has shaped
black biblical hermeneutics

00:49:51.690 --> 00:49:55.790
and interpretation in particular
ways to produce a reading

00:49:55.790 --> 00:49:57.590
of scripture among
African Americans

00:49:57.590 --> 00:49:58.890
that emphasizes their humanity

00:49:58.890 --> 00:50:00.650
and celebrates their
particularity.

00:50:00.650 --> 00:50:06.350
Understanding how African
Americans have wrestled

00:50:06.350 --> 00:50:09.470
with the bible is essential to
understanding their formation

00:50:09.470 --> 00:50:14.050
as a people and their survival
through the pains of slavery,

00:50:14.050 --> 00:50:15.770
Jim Crowe [assumed
spelling] segregation,

00:50:15.770 --> 00:50:19.630
and continuing race-based
oppression.

00:50:19.630 --> 00:50:22.210
For evangelical Christians,
the authority

00:50:22.210 --> 00:50:25.740
of scripture is the
central pillar of belief.

00:50:25.740 --> 00:50:27.690
Historically, as Africans

00:50:27.690 --> 00:50:31.060
in America overwhelmingly
became evangelical Christians

00:50:31.060 --> 00:50:34.520
in the 18th and 19th
Centuries, their encounters

00:50:34.520 --> 00:50:38.840
with the bible determinatively
shaped their interactions

00:50:38.840 --> 00:50:40.450
with others.

00:50:40.450 --> 00:50:43.150
They rejected biblical
texts that seemed

00:50:43.150 --> 00:50:46.010
to favor slaving while
embrace -- emblaze --

00:50:46.010 --> 00:50:50.650
embracing those that reinforce
blacks claims of humanity

00:50:50.650 --> 00:50:53.420
and demands for equality.

00:50:55.750 --> 00:50:58.210
Henry Louis Gates argues

00:50:58.210 --> 00:51:00.180
that among the earliest
black writings

00:51:00.180 --> 00:51:03.260
in English are five
slave narratives

00:51:03.260 --> 00:51:05.060
that include a similar encounter

00:51:05.060 --> 00:51:08.720
between a black slave
and the bible.

00:51:08.720 --> 00:51:11.400
Based on the similarities
of these encounters,

00:51:11.400 --> 00:51:15.920
Gates' calls this the trope
of the talking book and notes

00:51:15.920 --> 00:51:20.280
that it's found in slave
narratives published in 1770,

00:51:20.280 --> 00:51:27.620
1785, 1787, 1789 and 1815.

00:51:27.620 --> 00:51:30.290
The first slave narrative
in which the trope

00:51:30.290 --> 00:51:34.230
of the talking book
appears is in a narrative

00:51:34.230 --> 00:51:36.850
of the most remarkable
particulars in the life

00:51:36.850 --> 00:51:42.560
of James, Albert [inaudible],
an African prince related

00:51:42.560 --> 00:51:47.300
by himself written by James
Albert [inaudible] and published

00:51:47.300 --> 00:51:57.320
in at least seven versions
including a 1770, 1774, 1790,

00:51:57.320 --> 00:52:03.380
1810, 1811, and 1814 edition.

00:52:03.380 --> 00:52:05.160
[inaudible]'s narrative
is thought

00:52:05.160 --> 00:52:08.300
to have been only the second
such slave narrative written

00:52:08.300 --> 00:52:11.980
in English after
the 1760 narrative

00:52:11.980 --> 00:52:14.900
of the incompetent sufferings
and surprising deliverance

00:52:14.900 --> 00:52:18.690
of Britain Hammond [assumed
spelling], a Negro man.

00:52:18.690 --> 00:52:22.480
Throughout his slave narrative,
[inaudible] is fascinated

00:52:22.480 --> 00:52:23.880
with literacy and books.

00:52:23.880 --> 00:52:27.490
But it is not until he
encounters a bible in English

00:52:27.490 --> 00:52:30.860
that this fascination
comes to a head.

00:52:30.860 --> 00:52:34.010
Having observed his
master read from the bible,

00:52:34.010 --> 00:52:38.060
[inaudible] is shocked when
he is unable to hear anything

00:52:38.060 --> 00:52:42.050
from the book himself.

00:52:42.050 --> 00:52:45.680
"My master used to
read prayers in public

00:52:45.680 --> 00:52:49.460
to the ship's crew every Sabbath
Day and then I saw him read.

00:52:49.460 --> 00:52:52.480
I was never so surprised
in my life.

00:52:52.480 --> 00:52:56.190
And when I took the - when I
saw the book take to my master,

00:52:56.190 --> 00:52:58.730
for I wished it did
as I observed him

00:52:58.730 --> 00:53:01.840
to look upon it and
move his lips.

00:53:01.840 --> 00:53:04.670
I wished it would do so for me.

00:53:04.670 --> 00:53:07.740
As soon as my master had
done reading, I followed him

00:53:07.740 --> 00:53:11.510
to the place where he put the
book being mightily delighted

00:53:11.510 --> 00:53:12.810
with it.

00:53:12.810 --> 00:53:17.020
And when nobody saw me, I
opened it and put my ear

00:53:17.020 --> 00:53:20.270
down close upon it
in great hopes

00:53:20.270 --> 00:53:23.040
that it would say
something to be.

00:53:23.040 --> 00:53:27.270
But I was sorry and greatly
disappointed when I found

00:53:27.270 --> 00:53:30.360
that it would not speak.

00:53:30.360 --> 00:53:35.420
This spot immediately presented
itself to me, that everybody

00:53:35.420 --> 00:53:41.450
and everything despised
me because I was black.

00:53:41.450 --> 00:53:48.750
The bible talked to him as a
consequence of his blackness.

00:53:48.750 --> 00:53:53.590
However, by the end of his life,
he's become literate in Dutch,

00:53:53.590 --> 00:53:56.710
and English, and conversant
with Protestant Christianity.

00:53:56.710 --> 00:54:00.060
In the years following that --

00:54:00.060 --> 00:54:01.940
the publication of
that narrative,

00:54:01.940 --> 00:54:05.320
at least four other authors
would describe an encounter

00:54:05.320 --> 00:54:10.400
with the bible that Gates calls
the "Trope of the Talking Book".

00:54:10.400 --> 00:54:12.620
As each author took
up the trope,

00:54:12.620 --> 00:54:16.220
he transformed it as he told it.

00:54:16.220 --> 00:54:21.320
In a final version,
John Jay told the Trope

00:54:21.320 --> 00:54:24.370
in his autobiography,
"The Life, History,

00:54:24.370 --> 00:54:28.280
and Unparalleled
Sufferings of John Jay".

00:54:28.280 --> 00:54:32.560
Although published in 1815,
Jay's narrative was thought lost

00:54:32.560 --> 00:54:35.540
until rediscovered in 1983.

00:54:35.540 --> 00:54:38.470
As a result, it does not appear
in many standard bibliographies

00:54:38.470 --> 00:54:41.950
of black biographies
of the period.

00:54:41.950 --> 00:54:43.680
Jay writes that his final --

00:54:43.680 --> 00:54:46.520
his initial encounter with
the bible is very similar

00:54:46.520 --> 00:54:49.530
to Breanna Shaw's
in its futility.

00:54:49.530 --> 00:54:52.660
"I took up the book
and held it to my ears

00:54:52.660 --> 00:54:56.190
to try whether the book
would talk to me or not.

00:54:56.190 --> 00:54:58.650
But it proved to be all in vain

00:54:58.650 --> 00:55:02.780
for I could not hear it speak
one word which caused me

00:55:02.780 --> 00:55:07.590
to grieve and lament that after
God had done so much for me,

00:55:07.590 --> 00:55:12.440
as he had in pardoning my sins,
and blotting out my inequities,

00:55:12.440 --> 00:55:15.890
and transgressions, and
making me a new creature,

00:55:15.890 --> 00:55:20.760
the book would not talk to me."

00:55:20.760 --> 00:55:24.370
Nevertheless, Jay is
encouraged by God and decides

00:55:24.370 --> 00:55:27.000
to devote himself to
prayer and supplication,

00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:31.590
so that God will give him the
gift of literacy and in effect,

00:55:31.590 --> 00:55:39.110
force the book -- the
bible -- to talk to him.

00:55:39.110 --> 00:55:43.380
The Lord heard my groans and
cries at the end of six weeks

00:55:43.380 --> 00:55:49.020
and sent the blessed angel
of the covenant to my heart

00:55:49.020 --> 00:55:51.960
and soul to release me
from my stress and troubles

00:55:51.960 --> 00:55:53.570
and delivered me
from all my enemies

00:55:53.570 --> 00:55:55.010
which were ready to destroy me.

00:55:55.010 --> 00:55:56.310
[ Coughing ]

00:55:56.310 --> 00:55:58.290
Thus, the Lord was so
pleased in his infinite mercy

00:55:58.290 --> 00:56:01.790
to send an angel in a vision
in shining arraignment,

00:56:01.790 --> 00:56:06.650
and his counting, and shining
like the sun with a large bible

00:56:06.650 --> 00:56:09.730
in his hands, and brought
it to me, and said,

00:56:09.730 --> 00:56:15.150
"I am come to bless the and
to grant the thy request."

00:56:15.150 --> 00:56:17.680
Thus, my eyes were
opened at the end

00:56:17.680 --> 00:56:20.970
of six weeks while I was praying
in the place where I slept.

00:56:20.970 --> 00:56:22.270
Although the place was as dark

00:56:22.270 --> 00:56:25.150
as a dungeon I awoke
s the scripture said,

00:56:25.150 --> 00:56:28.430
and found it illuminated with
the light of the glory of God,

00:56:28.430 --> 00:56:33.860
and an angel standing beside
me with a large book open

00:56:33.860 --> 00:56:36.670
which was the Holy bibl.

00:56:36.670 --> 00:56:39.130
And said to me, "Thou
has desire to read,

00:56:39.130 --> 00:56:42.440
and understand this book, and
to speak the language of it both

00:56:42.440 --> 00:56:44.410
in English and in Dutch.

00:56:44.410 --> 00:56:49.900
I will therefore teach
them and now, read."

00:56:51.290 --> 00:56:54.790
Of the four authors who reused
the Trope of the Talking Book

00:56:54.790 --> 00:56:58.590
in their slave narratives
-- John [inaudible],

00:56:58.590 --> 00:57:00.570
John Stewart [assumed spelling],

00:57:00.570 --> 00:57:03.820
Alonso [assumed spelling]
[inaudible] and John Jay --

00:57:03.820 --> 00:57:07.120
none were content to leave
the trope as Breanna saw --

00:57:07.120 --> 00:57:10.790
had presented it with the bible
having been silent before a

00:57:10.790 --> 00:57:12.580
black supplicant.

00:57:12.580 --> 00:57:16.720
Indeed, in Jay's narrative the
bible speaks to him in English

00:57:16.720 --> 00:57:21.020
and Dutch precisely because
of his faithfulness in prayer

00:57:21.020 --> 00:57:23.930
and supplication before God.

00:57:23.930 --> 00:57:28.130
The bible recognizes and
affirms Jay's humanity.

00:57:28.130 --> 00:57:31.750
It speaks to him as to others
as a result of sovereign

00:57:31.750 --> 00:57:35.890
and miraculous acts of God.

00:57:35.890 --> 00:57:38.520
God affirms Jay's humanity.

00:57:38.520 --> 00:57:43.410
And so, the book -- the
bible -- speaks to him.

00:57:43.410 --> 00:57:47.760
In these slave narratives
and in black preaching,

00:57:47.760 --> 00:57:53.890
the bible is the bible because
it speaks to black people.

00:57:53.890 --> 00:57:56.330
In "Notes on the
State of Virginia",

00:57:56.330 --> 00:57:59.160
Thomas Jefferson --
oh, there it was.

00:57:59.160 --> 00:58:00.460
I'm sorry.

00:58:00.460 --> 00:58:02.470
I knew it was in
there somewhere.

00:58:02.470 --> 00:58:07.450
Sorry. In "Notes on the State of
Virginia", Thomas Jefferson --

00:58:07.450 --> 00:58:09.940
perhaps the preeminent
and enlightened thinker

00:58:09.940 --> 00:58:11.240
on the America's --

00:58:11.240 --> 00:58:15.070
wrote speculatively about
blacks' abilities concluding

00:58:15.070 --> 00:58:19.980
that while in music they're more
generally gifted than whites

00:58:19.980 --> 00:58:24.740
with accurate ears for tune and
time, he nevertheless lamented

00:58:24.740 --> 00:58:27.550
that their gifts for
reason or literature were

00:58:27.550 --> 00:58:31.470
in his view entirely absent.

00:58:31.470 --> 00:58:35.070
But I -- but never
yet could I find

00:58:35.070 --> 00:58:37.380
that a black had
uttered a thought

00:58:37.380 --> 00:58:41.640
above the level of
plain narration.

00:58:41.640 --> 00:58:43.320
Misery is often the parent

00:58:43.320 --> 00:58:47.390
of the most effecting
touches in poetry.

00:58:47.390 --> 00:58:49.870
Among the blacks
is misery enough,

00:58:49.870 --> 00:58:53.710
God knows, but no poetry.

00:58:53.710 --> 00:58:55.960
This is from his notes
on the state of Virginia.

00:58:55.960 --> 00:58:58.520
He then goes on to misspell
Phyllis Wheatley's [assumed

00:58:58.520 --> 00:59:00.690
spelling] name.

00:59:00.690 --> 00:59:05.560
The fiery black abolitionist,
David Walker was affronted

00:59:05.560 --> 00:59:10.080
by Jefferson's quest - comments
questioning black abilities.

00:59:10.080 --> 00:59:13.560
Of Jefferson, Walker wrote,
"I say that unless we try

00:59:13.560 --> 00:59:18.220
to refute Mr. Jefferson's
arguments respecting us,

00:59:18.220 --> 00:59:20.630
they will only establish them.

00:59:20.630 --> 00:59:22.960
Walker then undertook
to refute Jefferson

00:59:22.960 --> 00:59:26.880
by presenting a reasoned and
well-articulated argument

00:59:26.880 --> 00:59:29.680
for black equality in
America from the bible

00:59:29.680 --> 00:59:33.580
and the federal government's
own founding documents.

00:59:33.580 --> 00:59:37.680
In 1829, Walker published
his answers

00:59:37.680 --> 00:59:41.130
to Jefferson's [inaudible]
in his book "Walker's Appeal"

00:59:41.130 --> 00:59:43.970
in four articles
together with the preamble

00:59:43.970 --> 00:59:47.490
to the colored citizens of
the world, but in particular

00:59:47.490 --> 00:59:52.970
and very expressly to those of
the United States of America.

00:59:52.970 --> 00:59:57.810
In his appeal, Walker attacks
Jefferson arguing slavery

00:59:57.810 --> 00:59:59.110
and the general oppression

00:59:59.110 --> 01:00:00.410
of black people was
a sin before God.

01:00:00.410 --> 01:00:06.640
Including Jefferson among the
enemies of God, Walker predicts

01:00:06.640 --> 01:00:12.110
that God's judgment will fall
upon those who oppress blacks,

01:00:12.110 --> 01:00:14.830
and those enemies
who for hundreds

01:00:14.830 --> 01:00:18.540
of years stole our rights,
and kept us ignorant of him,

01:00:18.540 --> 01:00:20.220
and his divine worship.

01:00:20.220 --> 01:00:22.500
He will remove.

01:00:22.500 --> 01:00:25.880
Fear not the number in
education of our enemies

01:00:25.880 --> 01:00:31.120
against whom we have to contend
for our lawful right guaranteed

01:00:31.120 --> 01:00:34.900
to us by our maker for
why should we be afraid

01:00:34.900 --> 01:00:38.640
when God is -- and will
continue if we continue

01:00:38.640 --> 01:00:41.830
to be humble, to be on our side.

01:00:41.830 --> 01:00:45.090
For Walker, slavery contradicted
scripture because it went

01:00:45.090 --> 01:00:48.330
against the most basic
of Jesus' teachings --

01:00:48.330 --> 01:00:51.810
the golden rule as
found in Matthew 7.

01:00:51.810 --> 01:00:59.160
Our divine Lord and master said,
"All things whatsoever you would

01:00:59.160 --> 01:01:04.000
that men should do unto you,
do ye even so unto them"

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:07.050
which is found in Matthew 7:12.

01:01:07.050 --> 01:01:11.300
But an American minister with
a bible in his hands holds us

01:01:11.300 --> 01:01:15.290
and our children in the most
abject slavery and wretchedness.

01:01:15.290 --> 01:01:20.400
Now I ask them would they
like for us to hold them

01:01:20.400 --> 01:01:24.950
and their children in abject
slavery and wretchedness?

01:01:24.950 --> 01:01:26.850
"How -- " Walker asks, " --

01:01:26.850 --> 01:01:30.230
could a Christian countenance
[assumed spelling] slavery?"

01:01:30.230 --> 01:01:35.910
His answer is to approve of
slavery is to deny the bible.

01:01:35.910 --> 01:01:38.650
Walker told of once traveling
to hear a minister preach

01:01:38.650 --> 01:01:40.380
at a camp meeting
in South Carolina.

01:01:40.380 --> 01:01:45.350
"Being seated, I fixed
myself in complete position

01:01:45.350 --> 01:01:46.670
to hear the word of the save --

01:01:46.670 --> 01:01:51.130
of my Savior and to receive such
as I thought was authenticated

01:01:51.130 --> 01:01:53.320
by the Holy scriptures.

01:01:53.320 --> 01:01:56.250
But to my no ordinary
astonishment,

01:01:56.250 --> 01:02:00.130
our referend gentleman got
up and told us colored people

01:02:00.130 --> 01:02:03.410
that slaves must be obeyed
-- obedient to their masters,

01:02:03.410 --> 01:02:06.620
must do their duty to their
masters or be whipped.

01:02:06.620 --> 01:02:11.880
The whip was made for the backs
of fools", etc. Here I pause

01:02:11.880 --> 01:02:15.540
for a moment to give
the world time

01:02:15.540 --> 01:02:20.990
to consider what was my
surprise, to hear such preaching

01:02:20.990 --> 01:02:24.770
from a minister of my
master whose very gospel is

01:02:24.770 --> 01:02:27.240
that of peace and not of blood,

01:02:27.240 --> 01:02:31.570
and whips as this
pretended preacher tried

01:02:31.570 --> 01:02:34.410
to make us believe.

01:02:34.410 --> 01:02:37.640
For Walker, that could
not be the gospel

01:02:37.640 --> 01:02:40.390
that was being preached.

01:02:40.390 --> 01:02:42.830
David Walker declared that
this could not be the gospel

01:02:42.830 --> 01:02:45.450
that was being preached
because it was antithetical

01:02:45.450 --> 01:02:48.550
to Jesus' teachings
on love and justice.

01:02:48.550 --> 01:02:50.590
For walker, such declarations

01:02:50.590 --> 01:02:55.140
as "slaves obey your masters"
invalidated both the preacher

01:02:55.140 --> 01:02:56.880
and his message.

01:02:56.880 --> 01:03:00.850
Indeed, for Walker it was not
scripture unless it affirmed

01:03:00.850 --> 01:03:04.490
blacks, humanity and
relationship with God.

01:03:04.490 --> 01:03:07.230
In questioning this
preacher's use of scripture,

01:03:07.230 --> 01:03:10.910
Walker was actually questioning
the man's identification s

01:03:10.910 --> 01:03:12.970
a Christian.

01:03:12.970 --> 01:03:15.620
Despite how this
pretend preacher --

01:03:15.620 --> 01:03:19.060
as Walker called him -- might
have identified himself,

01:03:19.060 --> 01:03:21.890
Walker argued that he cannot
actually be a Christian

01:03:21.890 --> 01:03:25.730
if he fails to live and
teach the liberating love

01:03:25.730 --> 01:03:29.390
at the heart of the gospel.

01:03:29.390 --> 01:03:32.040
Maria Stewart -- David
Walker's protégé --

01:03:32.040 --> 01:03:34.840
took up Walker's published
work after his death

01:03:34.840 --> 01:03:36.580
and eventually published
her speeches,

01:03:36.580 --> 01:03:43.470
and theological meditations in a
book in 1835 and again in 1879.

01:03:43.470 --> 01:03:46.550
Stewart was believed to be
the first American woman black

01:03:46.550 --> 01:03:50.500
or white to give a
political speech before a

01:03:50.500 --> 01:03:52.220
promiscuous audience.

01:03:52.220 --> 01:03:54.070
That's more interesting
than it sounds.

01:03:54.070 --> 01:03:57.060
It just means an audience that
contains men and women in it.

01:03:57.060 --> 01:03:59.110
[ Laughter ]

01:03:59.110 --> 01:04:03.230
And to leave extended
copies of her text.

01:04:03.230 --> 01:04:06.770
In addition to arguing as Walker
had that God would judge America

01:04:06.770 --> 01:04:09.570
for the treatment of blacks,
Stewart also contended

01:04:09.570 --> 01:04:11.420
that African Americans
were a people

01:04:11.420 --> 01:04:14.890
of particular blessing by God.

01:04:14.890 --> 01:04:18.680
They were children
of God's covenant.

01:04:18.680 --> 01:04:23.510
Stewart's use of scripture seems
to invite endless examination.

01:04:23.510 --> 01:04:26.490
But on almost every level
the meeting grows richer

01:04:26.490 --> 01:04:30.610
as the scriptures comment
and illuminate the text

01:04:30.610 --> 01:04:31.910
into which it has been set.

01:04:31.910 --> 01:04:34.510
An example of this
is the elegance

01:04:34.510 --> 01:04:41.170
of Stewart's masterful knowledge
of the bible and it's clear

01:04:41.170 --> 01:04:42.980
in five little words which -

01:04:42.980 --> 01:04:47.060
with which she powerfully frames
a new exegetical paradigm.

01:04:47.060 --> 01:04:50.510
She states simply, "Of those
Americans who have grown rich

01:04:50.510 --> 01:04:54.180
at the expense of the labor of
slaves and the oppressed blacks,

01:04:54.180 --> 01:04:57.580
you fair sumptuously every day."

01:04:57.580 --> 01:05:00.180
The biblical illusion is clear.

01:05:00.180 --> 01:05:04.240
Stewart is quoting Luke
16:19-31 "The Parable

01:05:04.240 --> 01:05:07.490
of Lazarus and the Rich Man".

01:05:07.490 --> 01:05:11.850
In "The Parable", Jesus tells of
a rich man who dies after a life

01:05:11.850 --> 01:05:17.240
of ease in which he faired
sumptuously every day only

01:05:17.240 --> 01:05:20.340
to end up in hell.

01:05:20.340 --> 01:05:23.120
While in torment in hell,
he looks up to heaven

01:05:23.120 --> 01:05:24.890
and sees the old bag beggar,

01:05:24.890 --> 01:05:28.150
Lazarus who used
to sit at his door.

01:05:28.150 --> 01:05:30.770
Lazarus sits in Heaven being
comforted by none other

01:05:30.770 --> 01:05:33.630
than the patriarch Abraham.

01:05:33.630 --> 01:05:36.960
The rich man asks Abraham
to send Lazarus to Hell

01:05:36.960 --> 01:05:39.850
to get him some water to drink.

01:05:39.850 --> 01:05:44.650
Hell is apparently too hot
for the rich man and he's used

01:05:44.650 --> 01:05:49.340
to being comfortable even at
the expense of other's comfort.

01:05:49.340 --> 01:05:51.160
He doesn't seem to realize

01:05:51.160 --> 01:05:55.900
that things have
radically changed forever.

01:05:55.900 --> 01:05:59.150
Abraham refuses the request
noting the final ends

01:05:59.150 --> 01:06:00.560
of the two men are justified

01:06:00.560 --> 01:06:03.270
because of the lives
they lived on earth.

01:06:03.270 --> 01:06:06.260
The text itself is
subversive and Stewart's use

01:06:06.260 --> 01:06:08.480
of it's doubly subversive.

01:06:08.480 --> 01:06:12.920
You notice we keep the rich
man's name just "rich man"

01:06:12.920 --> 01:06:14.700
and Lazarus the poor man.

01:06:14.700 --> 01:06:19.010
It's like we've forgotten
Kluge or --

01:06:19.010 --> 01:06:20.310
[ Laughter ]

01:06:20.310 --> 01:06:25.820
We've forgotten the wealthy
name and we kept Leroy, right?

01:06:25.820 --> 01:06:28.200
In a further reversal of
the manifestations in life,

01:06:28.200 --> 01:06:31.210
the poor man is comforted in
Heaven after a miserable life

01:06:31.210 --> 01:06:33.980
on earth while the rich
man is tormented in hell

01:06:33.980 --> 01:06:37.230
after a comfortable
life on earth.

01:06:37.230 --> 01:06:40.270
Moreover, the rich man
believes even in hell

01:06:40.270 --> 01:06:43.280
that Lazarus will still
fetch and carry for him

01:06:43.280 --> 01:06:47.630
as the poor man did
when he was on earth.

01:06:47.630 --> 01:06:49.920
But in Stewart's retelling,

01:06:49.920 --> 01:06:55.670
in context it does not merely
describe a rich man punished

01:06:55.670 --> 01:07:00.850
and a poor man rewarded,
but rather slaves in Heaven

01:07:00.850 --> 01:07:04.040
and slave owners in Hell.

01:07:04.040 --> 01:07:07.740
Stewart's words, "You fair
sumptuously every day" can be

01:07:07.740 --> 01:07:10.420
taken at face value as
an indictment of those

01:07:10.420 --> 01:07:12.470
who live well and
particularly those

01:07:12.470 --> 01:07:16.050
in the slave-ocracy
whose leisure was brought

01:07:16.050 --> 01:07:18.610
from the forced labor of others.

01:07:18.610 --> 01:07:21.320
However, in the context
of Luke 16,

01:07:21.320 --> 01:07:25.970
"The Parable" becomes a broader,
more stark and eternal judgment

01:07:25.970 --> 01:07:29.170
against all of those who
lived well on the backs

01:07:29.170 --> 01:07:31.430
of others who were suffering.

01:07:31.430 --> 01:07:34.550
Since the Parable was set in
the context of final judgment

01:07:34.550 --> 01:07:38.170
with the ultimate
consequence of Heaven and Hell,

01:07:38.170 --> 01:07:42.500
Stewart's accusation that you
fair sumptuously every day

01:07:42.500 --> 01:07:45.270
invokes recollection
of one earthly banquet

01:07:45.270 --> 01:07:49.010
where Lazarus must
contend himself with crumbs

01:07:49.010 --> 01:07:53.700
and a later celestial
banquet where he reclines

01:07:53.700 --> 01:07:56.800
in Abraham's bosom
where the rich

01:07:56.800 --> 01:08:01.550
and hard-hearted master's
thirst goes unabated.

01:08:01.550 --> 01:08:03.970
As a result, Stewart's
invocation

01:08:03.970 --> 01:08:05.400
of the parable carries
with it some

01:08:05.400 --> 01:08:09.150
of the same apocalyptic
implications of judgment

01:08:09.150 --> 01:08:12.600
and social reversal that
was central to its telling

01:08:12.600 --> 01:08:14.740
in the gospel of Luke.

01:08:14.740 --> 01:08:17.710
It suggests slave
owners forgotten,

01:08:17.710 --> 01:08:21.260
and nameless slaves
comforted, and applauded.

01:08:21.260 --> 01:08:25.050
The rich hungry, but
the hungry filled.

01:08:25.050 --> 01:08:29.980
It suggests God's clear advocacy
for an ultimate rewarding

01:08:29.980 --> 01:08:34.090
of Lazarus, the punitive
underdog of the story.

01:08:40.750 --> 01:08:42.900
Here's Stewart's
words of indictment

01:08:42.900 --> 01:08:48.500
against the slave
system, "We will tell you

01:08:48.500 --> 01:08:51.440
that it is our goal that clothes
you in fine linen, and purple,

01:08:51.440 --> 01:08:54.240
and causes you to fair
sumptuously every day.

01:08:54.240 --> 01:08:56.920
And it is the blood of
our fathers and the tears

01:08:56.920 --> 01:09:00.130
of our brethren that
have enriched your soil.

01:09:00.130 --> 01:09:03.930
And we claim our rights."

01:09:03.930 --> 01:09:06.320
Stewart is prophetizing
a radical reversal --

01:09:06.320 --> 01:09:09.730
a come uppance for the wealthy
west and the vindication

01:09:09.730 --> 01:09:11.030
for the suffering Africa

01:09:11.030 --> 01:09:16.020
out of who's spilled blood
western wealth has flowed.

01:09:16.020 --> 01:09:19.670
Yet she must say it in ways
that encode her meanings,

01:09:19.670 --> 01:09:23.640
so that she's not killed because
of such incendiary words.

01:09:23.640 --> 01:09:26.250
For example, she writes simply,

01:09:26.250 --> 01:09:31.360
"You fair sumptuously
every day" quoting Luke 16,

01:09:31.360 --> 01:09:35.550
but without giving the text
or the rest of the parable

01:09:35.550 --> 01:09:39.370
which made me wonder when people
realized what bible verse she

01:09:39.370 --> 01:09:41.130
was quoting.

01:09:41.130 --> 01:09:45.100
I think she probably would've
preferred they got it the

01:09:45.100 --> 01:09:48.830
ride home.

01:09:48.830 --> 01:09:50.520
Stewart laced her
political speeches

01:09:50.520 --> 01:09:53.190
with biblical illusions
weaving her way in and out

01:09:53.190 --> 01:09:55.020
of the King James
version of the bible.

01:09:55.020 --> 01:09:57.320
I'm going to move ahead.

01:10:05.090 --> 01:10:08.610
Howard Thurman [assumed
spelling], who was Dean Ameritus

01:10:08.610 --> 01:10:11.620
of Howard University's Rank in
Chapel described the attitude

01:10:11.620 --> 01:10:14.330
of his grandmother who
had been born a slave.

01:10:14.330 --> 01:10:16.530
He recalled reading
the bible to this woman

01:10:16.530 --> 01:10:19.890
since she'd never learned to
read or write for herself.

01:10:19.890 --> 01:10:23.610
Thurman's grandmother would ask
him to read the psalms, Isiah,

01:10:23.610 --> 01:10:27.100
or the gospels, but never
the Paul line Epistles

01:10:27.100 --> 01:10:29.500
with the lone exception
of the 13th chapter

01:10:29.500 --> 01:10:30.800
of first Corinthians --

01:10:30.800 --> 01:10:34.470
that chapter on love which
she permitted to be read

01:10:34.470 --> 01:10:37.240
to her only very rarely.

01:10:37.240 --> 01:10:40.250
Eventually when he was older,
Thurman got up the nerve

01:10:40.250 --> 01:10:42.820
to ask his grandmother
why she was so particular

01:10:42.820 --> 01:10:45.120
about which bible verses
she was willing to hear.

01:10:45.120 --> 01:10:49.060
"With a feeling of
great temerity,

01:10:49.060 --> 01:10:51.470
I asked her one day why it was

01:10:51.470 --> 01:10:55.280
that she would not let me read
any of the Paul line letters.

01:10:55.280 --> 01:10:58.060
What she told me I
will never forget.

01:10:58.060 --> 01:11:00.100
'During the days of
slavery -- ' she said, ' --

01:11:00.100 --> 01:11:03.060
the master's minister would
occasionally hold services

01:11:03.060 --> 01:11:04.600
for the slaves.

01:11:04.600 --> 01:11:06.140
Old Man McGee was so mean.

01:11:06.140 --> 01:11:07.880
He would not let a Negro to --

01:11:07.880 --> 01:11:10.980
Negro minister to
preach to his slaves.

01:11:10.980 --> 01:11:15.140
Always the white minister used
as his text something from Paul.

01:11:15.140 --> 01:11:19.150
At least three or four times
a year he used as a text,

01:11:19.150 --> 01:11:24.130
"Slaves be obedient to those who
are your masters as to Christ'.

01:11:24.130 --> 01:11:27.080
Then he would go on to
show that it was God's will

01:11:27.080 --> 01:11:29.450
that we were slaves and
how if we were good,

01:11:29.450 --> 01:11:33.320
and happy slaves God would
bless them -- bless us.

01:11:33.320 --> 01:11:37.780
I promised my maker that
if I ever learned to read

01:11:37.780 --> 01:11:41.360
and if freedom ever
came, I would not read

01:11:41.360 --> 01:11:44.200
that part of the bible."

01:11:44.200 --> 01:11:47.110
Howard Thurman's grandmother
refused to hear text

01:11:47.110 --> 01:11:51.420
that even suggested her
enslavement was God's will.

01:11:51.420 --> 01:11:55.950
Instead she rejected such texts
preferring to find as canonical

01:11:55.950 --> 01:11:59.860
and authoritative only those
biblical passages that jived

01:11:59.860 --> 01:12:04.010
with her own sense of humanity.

01:12:04.010 --> 01:12:07.790
For African Americans, the
bible was a talking book.

01:12:07.790 --> 01:12:12.470
It spoke to their humanity
of their covenant with God.

01:12:12.470 --> 01:12:16.390
James Evans calls the
bible a text for outsiders.

01:12:16.390 --> 01:12:20.150
As the ultimate outsiders,
Africans in the Americas sought

01:12:20.150 --> 01:12:22.730
to make the bible their
own clinging to text

01:12:22.730 --> 01:12:25.600
that affirmed their humanity
while rejecting all others

01:12:25.600 --> 01:12:28.430
including other biblical
texts which seemed

01:12:28.430 --> 01:12:31.820
to deny them full inclusion
in the human family.

01:12:31.820 --> 01:12:35.240
If it didn't affirm them,
it wasn't scripture.

01:12:35.240 --> 01:12:39.240
A southern folk song
put it quite strongly,

01:12:39.240 --> 01:12:40.540
but for the purposes

01:12:40.540 --> 01:12:44.040
of our discussion today I will
replace the more vulgar N word

01:12:44.040 --> 01:12:49.810
that was found in the song with
a politer descriptor "negro".

01:12:49.810 --> 01:12:54.430
"Negro never went to free
school nor any other college

01:12:54.430 --> 01:12:55.840
and all the white folks wonder

01:12:55.840 --> 01:12:59.550
where that negro
got his knowledge.

01:12:59.550 --> 01:13:03.740
He chewed up all the bible and
then spat out the scripture.

01:13:03.740 --> 01:13:07.270
And when he began to argue
strong he were a snorting raptor

01:13:07.270 --> 01:13:08.870
[assumed spelling].

01:13:08.870 --> 01:13:13.390
African Americans chewed up
all the bible and then spat

01:13:13.390 --> 01:13:16.820
out the scripture in ways
that allowed them to survive

01:13:16.820 --> 01:13:19.220
and to thrive in the Americas."

01:13:19.220 --> 01:13:22.710
In the biblical text, they
found a narrative of liberation

01:13:22.710 --> 01:13:25.200
that included them even

01:13:25.200 --> 01:13:29.040
as others thought
desperately to exclude them.

01:13:29.040 --> 01:13:31.980
They spit out scripture
in spirituals, and songs,

01:13:31.980 --> 01:13:35.950
and sermons, and in
stories, and they survived.

01:13:35.950 --> 01:13:38.680
In the end, African
Americans were so well versed

01:13:38.680 --> 01:13:42.480
in the bible they had chewed
and so able to argue strong

01:13:42.480 --> 01:13:46.320
for their humanity by the
means of that same scripture

01:13:46.320 --> 01:13:48.550
that others were left to wonder

01:13:48.550 --> 01:13:51.790
where that negro
got his knowledge.

01:13:51.790 --> 01:13:55.630
Even when African Americans
were at their lowest,

01:13:55.630 --> 01:13:58.080
even when they were not human
in the eyes of the world

01:13:58.080 --> 01:14:02.510
and sometimes even in their own
eyes they clung to the bible

01:14:02.510 --> 01:14:05.330
and an understanding of
scripture that called them sons

01:14:05.330 --> 01:14:10.120
and daughters of Africa, and
sons and daughters of God.

01:14:10.120 --> 01:14:12.900
In their encounter
with religious others,

01:14:12.900 --> 01:14:15.860
African Americans have
tended to emphasize two ideas

01:14:15.860 --> 01:14:20.990
from scripture -- that God
is a liberator and that God

01:14:20.990 --> 01:14:26.490
who loves humanity
affirms their humanity.

01:14:26.490 --> 01:14:30.830
If it attests to our shared
humanity, if it portrays God

01:14:30.830 --> 01:14:36.600
as a liberator, and indeed
if the book talks to us,

01:14:36.600 --> 01:14:39.580
then that book describes the
God they've come to know.

01:14:39.580 --> 01:14:41.380
Thank you.

01:14:41.380 --> 01:15:00.890
[ Applause ]

01:15:00.890 --> 01:15:02.940
&gt;&gt; Lincoln Mullen: Good
afternoon, everyone.

01:15:02.940 --> 01:15:04.870
I want to thank the
Kluge Center,

01:15:04.870 --> 01:15:06.880
and especially Dan Druello
[assumed spelling] and Mark Noll

01:15:06.880 --> 01:15:09.470
for the invitation to
speak to you today.

01:15:09.470 --> 01:15:12.960
And as you'll see in a moment,
also thanks to the Library

01:15:12.960 --> 01:15:15.360
of Congress staff who are
behind the Chronicling America

01:15:15.360 --> 01:15:18.920
collection of digitized
historical newspapers.

01:15:18.920 --> 01:15:20.800
I'd like to begin by asking you

01:15:20.800 --> 01:15:24.020
to imagine three
different bibles.

01:15:24.020 --> 01:15:26.020
The first bible is
somebody's personal bible.

01:15:26.020 --> 01:15:28.010
As you flip through the pages,

01:15:28.010 --> 01:15:30.550
you might notice
highlighting and underlining.

01:15:30.550 --> 01:15:32.850
In many of the margins you'll
notice comments wrestling

01:15:32.850 --> 01:15:34.190
with the text.

01:15:34.190 --> 01:15:36.400
These marginal annotations
are a guide how

01:15:36.400 --> 01:15:38.530
that reader interpreted
the bible.

01:15:38.530 --> 01:15:39.830
You might quickly notice

01:15:39.830 --> 01:15:41.130
that the reader did
not give equal weight

01:15:41.130 --> 01:15:43.050
to all parts of scripture.

01:15:43.050 --> 01:15:45.630
Some readers will favor the
psalms, others the epistles

01:15:45.630 --> 01:15:49.590
to the romans, many
the prophetic passages.

01:15:49.590 --> 01:15:52.840
We could learn a lot about how a
particular person read the bible

01:15:52.840 --> 01:15:55.420
by looking at how
they marked it up.

01:15:55.420 --> 01:15:58.120
Okay. Next, I want you
to imagine a bible used

01:15:58.120 --> 01:16:00.270
by a particular church
or congregation.

01:16:00.270 --> 01:16:03.320
Maybe one of those imposing
leather bound folios.

01:16:03.320 --> 01:16:06.140
As far as I know, most
churches discourage you

01:16:06.140 --> 01:16:08.440
from marking up the bible.

01:16:08.440 --> 01:16:11.550
But using our historian's
imagination, we could figure

01:16:11.550 --> 01:16:13.860
out other ways to
get a sense of how

01:16:13.860 --> 01:16:16.710
that congregation
interpreted the scriptures.

01:16:16.710 --> 01:16:19.290
Perhaps we could catalog all the
texts that the minister preached

01:16:19.290 --> 01:16:22.030
from or that were
discussed at bible studies.

01:16:22.030 --> 01:16:24.620
Again, not every text
would receive equal weight

01:16:24.620 --> 01:16:25.920
and the members

01:16:25.920 --> 01:16:28.020
of the congregation would likely
have differences of opinion

01:16:28.020 --> 01:16:30.260
about the text that
they studied in content.

01:16:30.260 --> 01:16:32.000
And we could find
those passages --

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:35.030
those patterns of
usage revealing.

01:16:35.030 --> 01:16:39.440
By the way, let's move up one
more level of abstraction.

01:16:39.440 --> 01:16:43.020
What might a bible look like not
for an individual or a church,

01:16:43.020 --> 01:16:45.270
but for the public sphere?

01:16:45.270 --> 01:16:48.280
Many scholars have demonstrated
the significance of the bible

01:16:48.280 --> 01:16:50.410
for public affairs
in the United States.

01:16:50.410 --> 01:16:52.400
So, what would a marked up copy

01:16:52.400 --> 01:16:56.180
of America's public
bible look like?

01:17:00.040 --> 01:17:01.580
Thanks to the National
Endowment for the Humanities

01:17:01.580 --> 01:17:04.300
in the Library of Congress,
one place we could go looking

01:17:04.300 --> 01:17:07.820
for America's public bible
is in "Chronicling America".

01:17:07.820 --> 01:17:09.620
"Chronicling America"
is an amazing collection

01:17:09.620 --> 01:17:12.310
of some 13 million
newspaper pages covering more

01:17:12.310 --> 01:17:15.290
than a century and a
half of American history.

01:17:15.290 --> 01:17:18.160
Now there are many digitized
newspaper collections available

01:17:18.160 --> 01:17:21.490
from commercial publishers
mostly at a staggering expense

01:17:21.490 --> 01:17:24.030
to universities, but
the publicly funded

01:17:24.030 --> 01:17:26.490
"Chronicling America"
is something special.

01:17:26.490 --> 01:17:29.200
Instead of being locked behind
pay walls and license agreement

01:17:29.200 --> 01:17:30.920
that restrict most kinds of use,

01:17:30.920 --> 01:17:32.580
"Chronicling America"
is truly free.

01:17:32.580 --> 01:17:36.260
In the world of open source
software, they have a saying,

01:17:36.260 --> 01:17:39.220
"Chronicling America is
free as in free beer --

01:17:39.220 --> 01:17:40.840
" meaning you can use it
without paying for it " --

01:17:40.840 --> 01:17:44.300
but it's also free
as in free speech."

01:17:44.300 --> 01:17:45.680
Meaning that you can
use its open API's

01:17:45.680 --> 01:17:50.120
and bulk data downloads to do --
well, whatever you can think of.

01:17:50.120 --> 01:17:54.670
In 2016, I heard Mark Noll give
a paper at the American Society

01:17:54.670 --> 01:17:56.500
of Church History
which he counted

01:17:56.500 --> 01:17:59.360
which biblical texts were
using sermons after the deaths

01:17:59.360 --> 01:18:02.590
of Presidents Washington,
Lincoln and Garfield.

01:18:02.590 --> 01:18:04.250
It occurred to me then
that it might be possible

01:18:04.250 --> 01:18:06.860
to do something similar
using a computer program

01:18:06.860 --> 01:18:08.160
and chronicling America.

01:18:08.160 --> 01:18:10.010
So, thanks for the idea, Mark.

01:18:10.010 --> 01:18:11.590
[ Laughter ]

01:18:11.590 --> 01:18:13.290
I wrote a computer
program which scans through

01:18:13.290 --> 01:18:15.710
"Chronicling America"
looking for words and phrases

01:18:15.710 --> 01:18:18.360
in the King James
version of the bible.

01:18:18.360 --> 01:18:19.980
The program measures
certain things

01:18:19.980 --> 01:18:21.680
about those matching phrases.

01:18:21.680 --> 01:18:22.980
How many of them are there?

01:18:22.980 --> 01:18:25.730
Are there phrases which are
distinct to the bible such as

01:18:25.730 --> 01:18:29.710
"through a glass darkly" or are
they common phrases in English?

01:18:29.710 --> 01:18:32.310
Are the matched phrases close
to one another on the page

01:18:32.310 --> 01:18:35.010
or are they scattered?

01:18:35.010 --> 01:18:36.310
[ Coughing ]

01:18:36.310 --> 01:18:37.610
A machine learning model then
sorts through all of them

01:18:37.610 --> 01:18:39.560
to decide which of these
actually genuine quotations

01:18:39.560 --> 01:18:40.860
are illusions.

01:18:40.860 --> 01:18:43.680
The result is a list of which
verses were quoted or alluded

01:18:43.680 --> 01:18:46.290
to on which newspaper page.

01:18:46.290 --> 01:18:49.410
Like the marginal annotations in
a personal bible where the list

01:18:49.410 --> 01:18:51.990
of sermons preached
from a pulpit bible --

01:18:51.990 --> 01:18:54.910
this list of well over a million
quotations and counting --

01:18:54.910 --> 01:18:56.210
is one kind of evidence

01:18:56.210 --> 01:18:59.020
for understanding
America's public bible.

01:18:59.020 --> 01:19:01.260
When I go and read these
quotations in the context

01:19:01.260 --> 01:19:03.160
of these newspaper pages
in "Chronicling America",

01:19:03.160 --> 01:19:06.250
I'm consistently
surprised by what I find.

01:19:06.250 --> 01:19:08.940
Let me give you a
smattering of examples

01:19:08.940 --> 01:19:10.720
to show you what I mean.

01:19:10.720 --> 01:19:14.470
This newspaper that's on your
screen is an 1852 South Carolina

01:19:14.470 --> 01:19:16.830
newspaper which reprints
a sermon preached

01:19:16.830 --> 01:19:19.630
at St. Paul's cathedral
in London.

01:19:19.630 --> 01:19:21.880
The sermon was preached
against the idea that

01:19:21.880 --> 01:19:24.580
"divided the human
race into separate

01:19:24.580 --> 01:19:26.740
and distinct parentages
[assumed spelling]".

01:19:26.740 --> 01:19:30.080
In other words, it was
preached against polygenesis --

01:19:30.080 --> 01:19:33.210
the prevailing scientific
idea in the 19th Century

01:19:33.210 --> 01:19:36.020
that said different races
had different origin points

01:19:36.020 --> 01:19:39.940
or even the result of
different acts of creation.

01:19:39.940 --> 01:19:43.320
Against this scientific idea,
it martialed Paul's text

01:19:43.320 --> 01:19:45.820
from the book of Acts [assumed
spelling] that God has made

01:19:45.820 --> 01:19:49.330
of one blood all nations of men.

01:19:49.330 --> 01:19:54.640
The same text from Acts was
featured in an advertisement

01:19:54.640 --> 01:19:56.300
for the New York Tribune

01:19:56.300 --> 01:19:59.080
which circulated wildly
during the Civil War.

01:19:59.080 --> 01:20:02.130
The Tribune or Republican paper
promised potential readers

01:20:02.130 --> 01:20:05.060
that it was "Republican
in its hearty occasion

01:20:05.060 --> 01:20:07.420
to the great truth
that God has made

01:20:07.420 --> 01:20:10.560
of one blood all
nations of men."

01:20:10.560 --> 01:20:13.260
From these two examples
we can observe --

01:20:13.260 --> 01:20:15.660
as historians have pointed out
- that the bible was central

01:20:15.660 --> 01:20:18.350
to debates about race and
slavery in the 19th Century.

01:20:18.350 --> 01:20:21.820
And we can also notice that
the particular characteristics

01:20:21.820 --> 01:20:23.260
of newspaper publishing --

01:20:23.260 --> 01:20:25.820
such as advertisements
and reprinted articles --

01:20:25.820 --> 01:20:29.910
shaped how frequently text
from the bible were quoted.

01:20:29.910 --> 01:20:33.580
Of course, not all biblical
quotations were so serious.

01:20:33.580 --> 01:20:37.140
Take this widely circulated
joke printed in a 1912 newspaper

01:20:37.140 --> 01:20:39.670
in Oregon and it said that
up in the moonshine district

01:20:39.670 --> 01:20:42.800
in East Tennessee a popular
minister has this inscription

01:20:42.800 --> 01:20:45.010
posted on his door, "Jug
not lest ye be judged."

01:20:45.010 --> 01:20:46.690
[ Laughter ]

01:20:46.690 --> 01:20:50.480
You know, of course, that's a
reference to Matthew Chapter 5.

01:20:50.480 --> 01:20:53.260
Many biblical quotations
in newspapers were jokes.

01:20:53.260 --> 01:20:54.690
Being 19th Century jokes,

01:20:54.690 --> 01:20:57.450
they're not particularly
funny most times.

01:20:57.450 --> 01:20:59.680
But as Robert [inaudible]
pointed out in his essay

01:20:59.680 --> 01:21:02.780
on the Great Cat Massacre, "If
we can understand the jokes,

01:21:02.780 --> 01:21:05.000
then we are starting to
understand the foreign systems

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:07.130
of meaning in the past."

01:21:07.130 --> 01:21:10.470
Quotations from the bible and
newspapers often chose passages

01:21:10.470 --> 01:21:13.250
that were pithy,
programmatic or practical.

01:21:13.250 --> 01:21:16.080
It would be a tautology
to say that the verses

01:21:16.080 --> 01:21:17.770
which were quoted were quotable.

01:21:17.770 --> 01:21:20.890
But it's worth mentioning I
think that newspapers tended

01:21:20.890 --> 01:21:23.130
to engage with the
low-hanging fruit of the bible

01:21:23.130 --> 01:21:25.270
such as the parables,
and the proverbs,

01:21:25.270 --> 01:21:28.050
and mostly avoided any
kind of exposition except

01:21:28.050 --> 01:21:31.180
in reprinted sermons and
in Sunday school lessons.

01:21:31.180 --> 01:21:34.850
A large proportion of the uses
were casual rather than reverent

01:21:34.850 --> 01:21:36.980
and used the bibles for
meanings which could be imposed

01:21:36.980 --> 01:21:39.650
on rather than drawn out of it.

01:21:39.650 --> 01:21:42.010
You understand that "a million
quotations" I'm painting

01:21:42.010 --> 01:21:44.730
with a broad brush here.

01:21:44.730 --> 01:21:47.850
Sometimes though newspapers
did publish lengthy excerpts

01:21:47.850 --> 01:21:49.150
in the bible.

01:21:49.150 --> 01:21:50.940
Here an 1872 newspaper published

01:21:50.940 --> 01:21:54.250
without commentary all
three chapters on the sermon

01:21:54.250 --> 01:21:56.330
on the [inaudible]
under the title,

01:21:56.330 --> 01:21:58.010
"An original sermon
by the son of God".

01:21:58.010 --> 01:21:59.940
[ Laughter ]

01:21:59.940 --> 01:22:02.760
Initially, I thought that this
was just a newspaper man needing

01:22:02.760 --> 01:22:04.410
to fill column inches.

01:22:04.410 --> 01:22:07.190
But when I dug a little more
deeply into it, I asked, "What?

01:22:07.190 --> 01:22:09.280
Which newspaper was doing this?"

01:22:09.280 --> 01:22:12.890
It was the Weekly Caucasian
whose title page proclaimed its

01:22:12.890 --> 01:22:17.780
stand for state sovereignty
and white supremacy.

01:22:17.780 --> 01:22:20.830
Quite obviously, the bare fact
of quotation tells us little

01:22:20.830 --> 01:22:23.590
and we have to go back
to the newspapers to ask

01:22:23.590 --> 01:22:25.440
who quoted the text and why.

01:22:25.440 --> 01:22:28.800
Quotations from the bible and
newspapers were often driven

01:22:28.800 --> 01:22:30.100
by an effort to evangelize.

01:22:30.100 --> 01:22:31.910
[ Coughing ]

01:22:31.910 --> 01:22:33.350
There are relatively
few religious

01:22:33.350 --> 01:22:35.910
or denominational papers in
"Chronicling America" relative

01:22:35.910 --> 01:22:38.560
to their importance for 19th
Century newspaper publishing

01:22:38.560 --> 01:22:40.010
in general.

01:22:40.010 --> 01:22:41.310
[ Background noise ]

01:22:41.310 --> 01:22:42.860
But many papers had regular
or semi-regular sections

01:22:42.860 --> 01:22:45.030
with religious cults
like the "Sermon

01:22:45.030 --> 01:22:46.330
on the Mountain [assumed
spelling]",

01:22:46.330 --> 01:22:47.790
"The Weekly Caucasian"
that I just showed you

01:22:47.790 --> 01:22:51.550
or in this feature from
the [inaudible] in 1912.

01:22:51.550 --> 01:22:52.850
Now unfortunately, the big type

01:22:52.850 --> 01:22:55.320
in this headline didn't make
it any easier for my algorithm

01:22:55.320 --> 01:22:57.690
to find the quotation
and I'm not so sure

01:22:57.690 --> 01:23:00.100
that non-Christian readers
would've found it so easy

01:23:00.100 --> 01:23:03.620
to understand the sidebar which
consisted solely of quotations

01:23:03.620 --> 01:23:07.710
about sin and hell from the
bible without any explanation

01:23:07.710 --> 01:23:10.740
or text to glue them together.

01:23:10.740 --> 01:23:15.150
But the fact of this bare
quotation which happens

01:23:15.150 --> 01:23:17.820
in many different contexts
in the newspapers shows

01:23:17.820 --> 01:23:20.940
at least the presumption that
the bible was a commonly known,

01:23:20.940 --> 01:23:24.850
plainly interpretable text.

01:23:24.850 --> 01:23:28.150
The bible was often used as a
political slogan quite on par

01:23:28.150 --> 01:23:29.960
from any obvious
meaning in the text.

01:23:29.960 --> 01:23:32.320
In the 1876 presidential
election

01:23:32.320 --> 01:23:34.400
between Democrat
Samuel J. Tilden

01:23:34.400 --> 01:23:36.460
and the Republican Rutter
[assumed spelling] B. Hayes was

01:23:36.460 --> 01:23:37.760
hotly disputed.

01:23:37.760 --> 01:23:40.750
It eventually went to a
congressional commission

01:23:40.750 --> 01:23:44.080
which resolved in
favor of Rutherford,

01:23:44.080 --> 01:23:46.740
but in that intervening period
the Democratic papers were all

01:23:46.740 --> 01:23:48.570
sure that their candidate
had won

01:23:48.570 --> 01:23:51.840
and frequently quoted the
verse, "The Lord called Samuel"

01:23:51.840 --> 01:23:55.010
and added, "But not Rutherford".

01:23:55.010 --> 01:23:56.310
[ Laughter ]

01:23:56.310 --> 01:23:57.610
The Lord may have called Samuel,

01:23:57.610 --> 01:24:00.470
but the Congressional
commission picked Rutherford.

01:24:00.470 --> 01:24:02.880
Not all such political
quotations were superficial

01:24:02.880 --> 01:24:04.180
slogans, however.

01:24:04.180 --> 01:24:07.570
One of my favorite examples is
this retelling of the parable

01:24:07.570 --> 01:24:09.050
of the "The Good
Samaritan" titled

01:24:09.050 --> 01:24:11.440
"Reading Between the Lines".

01:24:11.440 --> 01:24:15.900
The parable identified the man
who was injured by the thieves

01:24:15.900 --> 01:24:21.210
as the people - the ones who did
the injuring as the Plutocrats,

01:24:21.210 --> 01:24:23.840
those who passed him
by as the Democratic,

01:24:23.840 --> 01:24:27.610
and Republican parties, and the
Samaritan who took care of him

01:24:27.610 --> 01:24:29.810
as the Populous Party.

01:24:29.810 --> 01:24:33.480
Here's an example from 1899
using a familiar passage

01:24:33.480 --> 01:24:37.240
of scripture for its moral
authority in public discourse.

01:24:37.240 --> 01:24:42.280
So, I want to suggest that
by using machine learning

01:24:42.280 --> 01:24:45.080
to find biblical quotations
in "Chronicling America",

01:24:45.080 --> 01:24:48.010
we can start to peace out what
this annotated marked up copy

01:24:48.010 --> 01:24:50.630
of America's public
bible looked like.

01:24:50.630 --> 01:24:52.620
These newspaper quotations
are like annotations

01:24:52.620 --> 01:24:55.470
in a personal bible in that
they provide us with a clue

01:24:55.470 --> 01:24:58.400
to how Americans read the
bible in a public sphere

01:24:58.400 --> 01:25:01.290
and how they argued
with and about it.

01:25:01.290 --> 01:25:03.610
Through these seven examples,
I tried to show you some

01:25:03.610 --> 01:25:05.720
of the kinds of surprising
evidence

01:25:05.720 --> 01:25:07.290
that we can turn up
using this method.

01:25:07.290 --> 01:25:10.910
And that's one of the key
points that I want to make.

01:25:10.910 --> 01:25:13.780
One of the things that I worry
most about as a historian is

01:25:13.780 --> 01:25:17.250
that I only find evidence of the
things that I go looking for.

01:25:17.250 --> 01:25:20.340
This is especially a problem for
large [inaudible] collections

01:25:20.340 --> 01:25:22.590
where you can find it --
always find an example or two

01:25:22.590 --> 01:25:26.580
of something in 13
million newspaper pages.

01:25:26.580 --> 01:25:29.670
So, this computational approach
is my way of trying to get

01:25:29.670 --> 01:25:31.220
around that limitation.

01:25:31.220 --> 01:25:32.540
I think of historical
research --

01:25:32.540 --> 01:25:35.450
the sort of historical detective
work that we do as swinging

01:25:35.450 --> 01:25:37.680
like a pendulum between
two polls.

01:25:37.680 --> 01:25:39.680
Sometimes historians
start with a question

01:25:39.680 --> 01:25:40.980
that they want to answer.

01:25:40.980 --> 01:25:43.840
Other times they go to the
archives or in this case

01:25:43.840 --> 01:25:46.190
to the Library of
Congress' digital collections

01:25:46.190 --> 01:25:47.860
to emerge ourselves
in the sources

01:25:47.860 --> 01:25:50.880
and understand what was
important to people at the time.

01:25:50.880 --> 01:25:53.150
The project I've been
describing is useful I hope

01:25:53.150 --> 01:25:55.090
because it uncovers
the kinds of things

01:25:55.090 --> 01:25:57.910
that I would never have known
to look for which I can then use

01:25:57.910 --> 01:26:00.510
to form new questions
about the past.

01:26:00.510 --> 01:26:02.270
The second point that
I want to make is

01:26:02.270 --> 01:26:05.870
that this computational approach
lets us see large scale trends

01:26:05.870 --> 01:26:07.670
that we would never have been
able to see while looking

01:26:07.670 --> 01:26:10.740
at the individual newspaper
page which we might only begin

01:26:10.740 --> 01:26:13.740
to intuit with a
life3time of study.

01:26:13.740 --> 01:26:16.050
Now we come to the
audience engagement portion

01:26:16.050 --> 01:26:17.720
of the afternoon.

01:26:17.720 --> 01:26:20.110
Here is a blank chart for you.

01:26:20.110 --> 01:26:21.470
Take this chart, for instance.

01:26:21.470 --> 01:26:22.900
How would you fill it in?

01:26:22.900 --> 01:26:26.340
From the 1840's to the 1920's
were there more biblical

01:26:26.340 --> 01:26:28.500
quotations per newspaper
page or fewer?

01:26:28.500 --> 01:26:31.270
Did the trend line go
up, or down, or sideways?

01:26:31.270 --> 01:26:33.480
I'm going to show you the
answer in a few minutes.

01:26:33.480 --> 01:26:35.680
But to keep you honest, I want
you to turn to your neighbor

01:26:35.680 --> 01:26:40.510
and I want to tell you -- you
to tell him or her your guess.

01:26:40.510 --> 01:26:52.050
[ Background noise ]

01:26:52.050 --> 01:26:59.370
&gt;&gt; Okay. There's not going
to be a quiz on the way out.

01:26:59.370 --> 01:27:01.320
Don't worry.

01:27:01.320 --> 01:27:03.580
So, I didn't say
this to trick you.

01:27:03.580 --> 01:27:06.180
I couldn't have filled in
this blank chart myself

01:27:06.180 --> 01:27:08.060
until I did the research.

01:27:08.060 --> 01:27:12.370
Here's what I found for
the bible as a whole.

01:27:12.370 --> 01:27:13.670
Unless you knew what this --

01:27:13.670 --> 01:27:16.570
unless you could guess what this
trend line would be in advance,

01:27:16.570 --> 01:27:18.890
once you've seen a visualization
like this it's easy

01:27:18.890 --> 01:27:20.600
to tell yourself
a "just so" story

01:27:20.600 --> 01:27:21.900
and assume you can already --

01:27:21.900 --> 01:27:24.170
you already knew
what the chart shows.

01:27:24.170 --> 01:27:26.820
But I could not guess
this in advance.

01:27:26.820 --> 01:27:29.450
The trend in quotations is
practically the opposite

01:27:29.450 --> 01:27:31.120
of what I assumed it would be.

01:27:31.120 --> 01:27:33.860
On the one hand, there is a very
steep decline from the 1830's

01:27:33.860 --> 01:27:36.270
to the early 1840's, but I
don't think that's the most

01:27:36.270 --> 01:27:37.570
important point.

01:27:37.570 --> 01:27:39.560
For one thing, there are
many fewer newspapers

01:27:39.560 --> 01:27:41.160
in "Chronicling America"
for that period,

01:27:41.160 --> 01:27:42.590
so there's a lot
more uncertainty

01:27:42.590 --> 01:27:43.940
about the trend line.

01:27:43.940 --> 01:27:46.830
And also, the 1830's
and 1840's were a period

01:27:46.830 --> 01:27:49.480
of especially high activism
among evangelical Protestants

01:27:49.480 --> 01:27:51.870
and it wouldn't be too
surprising to see a higher rate

01:27:51.870 --> 01:27:54.100
of quotation in that period.

01:27:54.100 --> 01:27:56.060
What is interesting
is that the trend goes

01:27:56.060 --> 01:27:59.250
up after the 1860's roughly
doubling from [inaudible]

01:27:59.250 --> 01:28:03.850
in the mid-1860's to the peaks
of the early 1890's in mid-10's.

01:28:03.850 --> 01:28:06.220
So, there's no easy narrative
of the secularization

01:28:06.220 --> 01:28:08.520
of the press -- whatever
secularization might mean

01:28:08.520 --> 01:28:09.820
in this case.

01:28:09.820 --> 01:28:11.830
Such general trends
are suggested.

01:28:11.830 --> 01:28:15.790
Why is there a peak in the
mid-1910's, for example?

01:28:15.790 --> 01:28:17.090
The answer is almost certainly

01:28:17.090 --> 01:28:19.540
that newspapers were publishing
material about the Great War,

01:28:19.540 --> 01:28:21.430
and memorials of the dead,

01:28:21.430 --> 01:28:23.620
and calls for sacrifice
lent themselves

01:28:23.620 --> 01:28:24.920
to biblical quotations.

01:28:24.920 --> 01:28:28.670
Now the trend for the bible as
a whole is much less interesting

01:28:28.670 --> 01:28:31.150
than the trend line
for individual verses.

01:28:31.150 --> 01:28:34.260
So, what verse would you guess
is the most frequently quoted

01:28:34.260 --> 01:28:36.850
in "Chronicling America"?

01:28:36.850 --> 01:28:39.510
Come on, you know you all
want to say John 3:16.

01:28:39.510 --> 01:28:42.200
[ Laughter ]

01:28:42.200 --> 01:28:43.500
That's what I would've
guessed --

01:28:43.500 --> 01:28:45.370
John 3:16, "For God
saw that the world --

01:28:45.370 --> 01:28:48.370
". But that text only became
popular at the beginning

01:28:48.370 --> 01:28:50.970
of the 20th Century and
only managed to squeak

01:28:50.970 --> 01:28:53.180
into the top 10 overall.

01:28:53.180 --> 01:28:56.880
The most popular verse was Luke
18:16, "Suffer little children

01:28:56.880 --> 01:28:59.360
to come unto me and
forbid them not."

01:28:59.360 --> 01:29:00.660
Why was it so popular?

01:29:00.660 --> 01:29:03.590
Because many newspapers
included Sunday school lessons

01:29:03.590 --> 01:29:07.650
and they often included that
verse at the top of the lesson.

01:29:07.650 --> 01:29:11.600
Coming in second was Matthew
25:21, "Well done thy good

01:29:11.600 --> 01:29:15.090
and faithful servant" which
was a reliable quotation

01:29:15.090 --> 01:29:16.580
for obituaries.

01:29:16.580 --> 01:29:19.200
But why was Exodus 20:15,

01:29:19.200 --> 01:29:23.070
"Though shall not steal"
suddenly so popular only

01:29:23.070 --> 01:29:25.410
in the years 1912 and 1913.

01:29:25.410 --> 01:29:28.420
It was not because the income
tax amendment was ratified

01:29:28.420 --> 01:29:30.490
in 1913, though that's
a pretty good guess.

01:29:30.490 --> 01:29:32.970
[ Laughter ]

01:29:32.970 --> 01:29:35.920
After Theodore Roosevelt lost
the Republican Party nomination

01:29:35.920 --> 01:29:38.420
to William Howard Taft,
he accepted the nomination

01:29:38.420 --> 01:29:40.560
of the Progressive Party
otherwise called the Bull

01:29:40.560 --> 01:29:41.940
Moose Party.

01:29:41.940 --> 01:29:45.010
He'd previously quoted the 10
Commandments in his 1906 --

01:29:45.010 --> 01:29:46.310
[ Coughing ]

01:29:46.310 --> 01:29:47.610
-- speech "The Man
with the Muckrake".

01:29:47.610 --> 01:29:49.950
And then, when he
accepted the nomination

01:29:49.950 --> 01:29:52.030
of the Bull Moose
Party, Roosevelt declared

01:29:52.030 --> 01:29:54.670
that his most important
principle went back

01:29:54.670 --> 01:29:55.970
to Sinai [assumed spelling],
"Though shalt not steal."

01:29:55.970 --> 01:29:57.340
"Thou shalt not steal
a nomination."

01:29:57.340 --> 01:30:00.360
"Thou shall neither steal in
politics nor in business."

01:30:00.360 --> 01:30:03.900
Thou shalt not steal
from the people --

01:30:03.900 --> 01:30:06.550
the birthrights of the
people to rule themselves.

01:30:06.550 --> 01:30:08.680
And newspapers launched
in a virtual frenzy

01:30:08.680 --> 01:30:11.090
of quoting the verse
"Thou shalt not steal."

01:30:11.090 --> 01:30:15.020
Progressives -- political
progressives insisted

01:30:15.020 --> 01:30:16.920
that Capitol was
stealing the fruits

01:30:16.920 --> 01:30:19.480
of labor whereas Capitalists
turned right around and said

01:30:19.480 --> 01:30:22.340
that the Labor Union Movement
was trying to steal the due

01:30:22.340 --> 01:30:24.350
that was owed to Capitalism.

01:30:24.350 --> 01:30:29.480
The point is that the
frequently quoted text

01:30:29.480 --> 01:30:32.660
which comprised America's
public bible changed over time.

01:30:32.660 --> 01:30:34.000
When we look at the
biblical text

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:36.240
that were frequently quoted,
we find a lot of debate

01:30:36.240 --> 01:30:38.140
about what they mean,
but the key text

01:30:38.140 --> 01:30:40.910
that were debated also
changed over time.

01:30:40.910 --> 01:30:42.210
One thing that I've been working

01:30:42.210 --> 01:30:44.380
on is clustering the time
series for these verses.

01:30:44.380 --> 01:30:45.820
In other words, I'm
trying to group verses

01:30:45.820 --> 01:30:47.500
which had a similar trend line.

01:30:47.500 --> 01:30:49.210
I still don't have all
the kinks worked out,

01:30:49.210 --> 01:30:51.820
but here are a few examples.

01:30:51.820 --> 01:30:54.850
Some verses were very popular up
to the 1860's and then declined

01:30:54.850 --> 01:30:56.530
in popularity during
the Civil War.

01:30:56.530 --> 01:31:01.470
Some verses were
very popular before

01:31:01.470 --> 01:31:04.000
and after the Civil
War, but not during.

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:06.270
Take for instance,
Matthew 19:16, "So,

01:31:06.270 --> 01:31:09.040
they are no longer two, but one.

01:31:09.040 --> 01:31:10.520
What God therefore
had joined together,

01:31:10.520 --> 01:31:13.190
let no man put asunder."

01:31:13.190 --> 01:31:15.000
This verse was obviously
about marriage,

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:16.940
but it had political
implications during the

01:31:16.940 --> 01:31:18.760
sectional crisis over slavery

01:31:18.760 --> 01:31:20.750
and then again during
reconstruction.

01:31:20.750 --> 01:31:23.070
But it must've had a bitter
taste during the Civil War.

01:31:23.070 --> 01:31:26.200
Other verses had chewed
[assumed spelling] peaks

01:31:26.200 --> 01:31:30.330
of popularity in
the 1870's-1900's.

01:31:30.330 --> 01:31:34.250
Psalm 1:33:1, "Behold how
good and how pleasant it is

01:31:34.250 --> 01:31:37.400
for brethren to dwell together
in unity" was a useful text

01:31:37.400 --> 01:31:39.490
for healing the nation's
wounds after the Civil War,

01:31:39.490 --> 01:31:42.180
but also for forgetting
about the promises made

01:31:42.180 --> 01:31:44.970
to the freed people
during reconstruction.

01:31:44.970 --> 01:31:49.640
And finally, some verses only
became popular in the 1920's.

01:31:49.640 --> 01:31:53.460
Why did John 15:13, "Greater
love have no man than this

01:31:53.460 --> 01:31:56.860
that a man lay down his life for
his friends" become so popular?

01:31:56.860 --> 01:31:58.810
Because it became the
text that was quoted

01:31:58.810 --> 01:32:02.320
in virtually every obituary
of a soldier or a sailor

01:32:02.320 --> 01:32:04.060
who died in World War I.

01:32:04.060 --> 01:32:06.910
Let me give you one
final example.

01:32:06.910 --> 01:32:11.760
We're going to look at a verse,
acts 20:35, "Laboring ye ought

01:32:11.760 --> 01:32:13.590
to support the weak
and remember the words

01:32:13.590 --> 01:32:15.790
of the Lord Jesus how he
said, 'It is more blessed

01:32:15.790 --> 01:32:18.260
to give than to receive'."

01:32:18.260 --> 01:32:19.810
This verse is an
interesting case study

01:32:19.810 --> 01:32:22.570
because it could be quoted for
either of those two phrases --

01:32:22.570 --> 01:32:24.760
"laboring to support the
weak" or "It is more blessed

01:32:24.760 --> 01:32:26.530
to give than to receive".

01:32:26.530 --> 01:32:30.050
But looking over the 2,600
instances I found so far

01:32:30.050 --> 01:32:31.350
in "Chronicling America",

01:32:31.350 --> 01:32:34.460
we can ask why this first
became popular over time.

01:32:34.460 --> 01:32:36.710
Was it the first part of
the verse used to critique

01:32:36.710 --> 01:32:38.380
or emirate [assumed
spelling] capitalism

01:32:38.380 --> 01:32:42.210
or was the second part of the
verse quoted more frequently?

01:32:42.210 --> 01:32:44.160
There are a few dozen
examples where the phrase

01:32:44.160 --> 01:32:46.820
"laboring ye ought to
support the weak" is used.

01:32:46.820 --> 01:32:48.900
One example's a story
called "The Sacrifice"

01:32:48.900 --> 01:32:52.830
which was circulated in western
newspapers in November of 1908.

01:32:52.830 --> 01:32:55.450
The story featured two
penniless and hungry men.

01:32:55.450 --> 01:32:57.340
When the first man
tried to rob the other,

01:32:57.340 --> 01:33:00.370
the victim gave him the meal
he had earned from menial labor

01:33:00.370 --> 01:33:02.520
and so saved the other
from a life of crime

01:33:02.520 --> 01:33:04.620
by going hungry himself.

01:33:04.620 --> 01:33:06.190
The phrase, "It is
more blessed to give

01:33:06.190 --> 01:33:08.690
than to receive" was far
more likely to be quoted.

01:33:08.690 --> 01:33:11.190
It was often used with
a request for donations

01:33:11.190 --> 01:33:12.490
to churches or charities.

01:33:12.490 --> 01:33:14.910
It was also used to
memorialize the dead,

01:33:14.910 --> 01:33:17.050
to encourage selflessness
or praise generosity,

01:33:17.050 --> 01:33:20.010
and to advertise life insurance.

01:33:20.010 --> 01:33:21.510
[ Laughter ]

01:33:21.510 --> 01:33:23.170
It was even used for jokes.

01:33:23.170 --> 01:33:26.000
After one bout, the boxer
Jack Johnson was said

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:29.010
to have given more
than he had received.

01:33:29.010 --> 01:33:30.310
[ Laughter ]

01:33:30.310 --> 01:33:31.780
But the real driver
of the popularity

01:33:31.780 --> 01:33:33.420
of this verse was Christmas --

01:33:33.420 --> 01:33:35.630
specifically the growing
popularity of Christmas

01:33:35.630 --> 01:33:36.930
as a consumer holiday.

01:33:36.930 --> 01:33:40.120
Here's an advertisement from
the chain of department stores

01:33:40.120 --> 01:33:42.900
that James Cash Penny [assumed
spelling] founded in 1902.

01:33:42.900 --> 01:33:45.500
Now the day of rejoicing
has come to us for we have

01:33:45.500 --> 01:33:47.900
in our own hearts realized the
truth that it is more blessed

01:33:47.900 --> 01:33:50.790
to give than to receive.

01:33:50.790 --> 01:33:52.190
By the early 20th Century,

01:33:52.190 --> 01:33:54.080
newspapers have become
more dependent on revenue

01:33:54.080 --> 01:33:56.390
from advertisers
and subscribers.

01:33:56.390 --> 01:33:58.000
And so, under our
quotation of this verse

01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:00.060
in large type the evening times

01:34:00.060 --> 01:34:02.770
of [inaudible] instructed
readers, "Start now

01:34:02.770 --> 01:34:05.550
and read The Times
advertisements closely

01:34:05.550 --> 01:34:07.590
and constantly every day.

01:34:07.590 --> 01:34:09.480
Then you will know where
to buy, and what to give,

01:34:09.480 --> 01:34:14.070
and purchase all your Christmas
presents to the best advantage."

01:34:14.070 --> 01:34:17.290
I would end with one
-- end with two points.

01:34:17.290 --> 01:34:19.270
One is that in terms
of methodology,

01:34:19.270 --> 01:34:21.430
this kind of computational
method is useful for

01:34:21.430 --> 01:34:23.770
"stirring the archive" as Lauren
Cline [assumed spelling] has

01:34:23.770 --> 01:34:25.070
put it.

01:34:25.070 --> 01:34:26.590
To figure out how the verse,
"It is more blessed to give

01:34:26.590 --> 01:34:29.100
than to receive" fit into the
public sphere, we had to look

01:34:29.100 --> 01:34:30.400
at both the general
trend line --

01:34:30.400 --> 01:34:31.700
[ Coughing ]

01:34:31.700 --> 01:34:34.820
-- and then the context of the
verse in individual newspapers.

01:34:34.820 --> 01:34:36.470
The second point
concerns the relationship

01:34:36.470 --> 01:34:38.600
between the bible
and the newspaper.

01:34:38.600 --> 01:34:39.900
The thing that I am struck

01:34:39.900 --> 01:34:42.310
by is just how malleable
America's public bible was.

01:34:42.310 --> 01:34:45.590
I thought that the debates
were going to be primarily

01:34:45.590 --> 01:34:47.910
over the bible with text
martialed in one side

01:34:47.910 --> 01:34:49.210
of a debate or another.

01:34:49.210 --> 01:34:52.360
But at least for newspapers
in the 19th Century,

01:34:52.360 --> 01:34:53.890
I would now say that
the debates tended

01:34:53.890 --> 01:34:56.550
to happen through the bible.

01:34:56.550 --> 01:34:59.490
That is to say that the
bible provided the language

01:34:59.490 --> 01:35:02.520
for expressing ideas in
the public sphere even more

01:35:02.520 --> 01:35:05.850
than it provided the
content for those ideas.

01:35:05.850 --> 01:35:10.230
As a storehouse of commandments,
stories, and moral reflection

01:35:10.230 --> 01:35:12.730
of pity [assumed spelling],
phrases, proverbs and parables,

01:35:12.730 --> 01:35:15.780
the bible was a common
yet contested text

01:35:15.780 --> 01:35:18.100
that provided much of the
framework for discussions

01:35:18.100 --> 01:35:21.120
of wealth and capitalism,
marriage and family,

01:35:21.120 --> 01:35:23.910
law and politics, and
even the occasional joke.

01:35:23.910 --> 01:35:25.710
Thank you.

01:35:25.710 --> 01:35:35.060
[ Applause ]

01:35:35.060 --> 01:35:38.270
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: I thank
all of you very much.

01:35:38.270 --> 01:35:42.130
We have a few minutes
for questions.

01:35:42.130 --> 01:35:44.190
And if you don't
have an opportunity

01:35:44.190 --> 01:35:46.320
to ask your question, we do
have a reception afterward

01:35:46.320 --> 01:35:48.560
and you might be able to
corner our scholars here, but.

01:35:48.560 --> 01:35:51.610
So, indicate to me if you have
a question and we have folks

01:35:51.610 --> 01:35:54.400
with microphones ready to --

01:35:55.950 --> 01:35:57.500
&gt;&gt; Male speaker:
Thank you very much.

01:35:57.500 --> 01:36:00.750
I enjoyed all the [inaudible].

01:36:00.750 --> 01:36:08.930
So, I just want to do two
things to move the discussion

01:36:08.930 --> 01:36:14.990
into other geographic
space which we have to do.

01:36:14.990 --> 01:36:18.170
And second, to move it

01:36:18.170 --> 01:36:21.700
to the zone [assumed
spelling] of non-believers.

01:36:21.700 --> 01:36:25.410
Suppose I'm not a Christian.

01:36:25.410 --> 01:36:30.600
Suppose I'm antagonistic
to the bible.

01:36:30.600 --> 01:36:34.600
How do you fit that
into your conversation?

01:36:34.600 --> 01:36:38.080
And I will do this by just
raising four good points

01:36:38.080 --> 01:36:40.030
to allow us to talk.

01:36:40.030 --> 01:36:43.410
One is the entire
concept of translation.

01:36:43.410 --> 01:36:51.660
So, your presentations are based
on various English additions

01:36:51.660 --> 01:36:58.220
because of your monolingualism.

01:36:58.220 --> 01:37:02.390
So, I was introduced to the
bible via another language

01:37:02.390 --> 01:37:11.650
and it is a document
that did a lot of damage

01:37:11.650 --> 01:37:12.950
to [inaudible] languages

01:37:12.950 --> 01:37:14.330
and [inaudible] --
incredible damage.

01:37:14.330 --> 01:37:17.090
And I will give you one example.

01:37:17.090 --> 01:37:18.390
I'm [inaudible].

01:37:18.390 --> 01:37:19.930
We don't have a concept
of a Satan.

01:37:19.930 --> 01:37:21.900
It doesn't exist
in the religion.

01:37:21.900 --> 01:37:25.930
We have a concept of witchcraft.

01:37:25.930 --> 01:37:32.100
So, in trying to resolve
this they joke a god

01:37:32.100 --> 01:37:35.860
of the crossroads called
[inaudible] was a very

01:37:35.860 --> 01:37:37.160
famous god.

01:37:37.160 --> 01:37:42.230
It was like an intermediary
between all the divinities

01:37:42.230 --> 01:37:43.530
and the [inaudible],

01:37:43.530 --> 01:37:48.210
Satan because they're
looking for [inaudible].

01:37:49.610 --> 01:37:55.560
But more so they are looking --
the critical problem they face

01:37:55.560 --> 01:37:57.820
when they were doing this
project in [inaudible]

01:37:57.820 --> 01:38:00.990
in the 19th Century is
what do you call God?

01:38:00.990 --> 01:38:03.340
What is a name for God?

01:38:03.340 --> 01:38:08.080
So, what they did is to
say, "We don't want the name

01:38:08.080 --> 01:38:12.780
in association with Paganism."

01:38:12.780 --> 01:38:17.470
So, then we credit the name

01:38:17.470 --> 01:38:21.700
which now give God a
homeland with the heaven.

01:38:21.700 --> 01:38:25.340
So, for instance, that's
my name, [inaudible].

01:38:25.340 --> 01:38:31.350
But that alone is not
necessarily generic biblical

01:38:31.350 --> 01:38:32.650
[assumed spelling].

01:38:32.650 --> 01:38:36.540
But they couldn't just get
a name for it and they said,

01:38:36.540 --> 01:38:39.010
"This big man who
lives in the sky."

01:38:39.010 --> 01:38:40.310
[ Coughing ]

01:38:40.310 --> 01:38:42.010
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: Could you
just still this to a question?

01:38:42.010 --> 01:38:43.310
&gt;&gt; Male speaker: Yes.

01:38:43.310 --> 01:38:44.610
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: Because I know
there's a lot of other people.

01:38:44.610 --> 01:38:45.910
&gt;&gt; Male speaker: Yes, that's it.

01:38:45.910 --> 01:38:47.210
&gt;&gt; John Haskell:
And we can get Mark

01:38:47.210 --> 01:38:48.510
and the others to come and -

01:38:48.510 --> 01:38:49.810
&gt;&gt; Male speaker: And
then, [inaudible].

01:38:49.810 --> 01:38:51.110
&gt;&gt;John Haskell: Just a
quick question would be good

01:38:51.110 --> 01:38:53.270
at this point because you've
already brought up enough

01:38:53.270 --> 01:38:54.570
for these folks to chew on.

01:38:54.570 --> 01:38:55.870
&gt;&gt; Male speaker: Wow.

01:38:55.870 --> 01:38:57.750
Okay. Finally, on Islam.

01:38:57.750 --> 01:39:02.640
Islam because there's
an extensive conserving

01:39:02.640 --> 01:39:06.360
conversation in Islam
about the bible.

01:39:06.360 --> 01:39:12.120
And when they're interrogating
the bible not as Christians,

01:39:12.120 --> 01:39:15.060
and not within the
Christian space,

01:39:15.060 --> 01:39:17.060
but outside of that space.

01:39:17.060 --> 01:39:18.360
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: Okay.

01:39:18.360 --> 01:39:19.660
Thank you.

01:39:19.660 --> 01:39:21.870
Mark, do you want
to speak briefly?

01:39:21.870 --> 01:39:25.060
&gt;&gt; Mark Noll: I just -- to
brief matters, first question

01:39:25.060 --> 01:39:27.380
about the place in the
bible for non-believers,

01:39:27.380 --> 01:39:32.300
it is an interesting reality
that in the 19th Century one

01:39:32.300 --> 01:39:37.750
of the most able bible
quotes was Robert Ingersoll,

01:39:37.750 --> 01:39:40.150
the public atheist and
he knew the bible well.

01:39:40.150 --> 01:39:43.820
He actually recommended it to
people to study, but with a kind

01:39:43.820 --> 01:39:45.390
of Tom Payne conclusion.

01:39:45.390 --> 01:39:48.440
So, he had the Thomas
Huxley approach.

01:39:48.440 --> 01:39:52.940
Huxley, the great
atheist/evolutionist wanted

01:39:52.940 --> 01:39:55.010
to keep the King James
bible in English schools

01:39:55.010 --> 01:39:56.780
because of its cultural place.

01:39:56.780 --> 01:40:00.040
But the foreign matter
is a different situation.

01:40:00.040 --> 01:40:02.980
You know the work of [inaudible]
and he's gone into a lot

01:40:02.980 --> 01:40:06.210
of these more difficult
issues that I think are --

01:40:06.210 --> 01:40:09.350
would pertain to non-English
speakers in the U.S.,

01:40:09.350 --> 01:40:12.740
but not so much the English
speaking population here.

01:40:12.740 --> 01:40:14.040
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: And if --

01:40:14.040 --> 01:40:15.940
Lincoln, if you want
to say something?

01:40:15.940 --> 01:40:18.840
&gt;&gt; Lincoln Mullen: I want to
echo Mark's recommendation

01:40:18.840 --> 01:40:20.140
on [inaudible]'s work.

01:40:20.140 --> 01:40:22.100
One of the interesting
things that I learned

01:40:22.100 --> 01:40:27.090
from his work is the difference
between the way that protestants

01:40:27.090 --> 01:40:31.650
and Islam treat the sacrality
[assumed spelling] of text.

01:40:31.650 --> 01:40:34.350
So, my understanding
anyway is that in Islam,

01:40:34.350 --> 01:40:40.180
only the original text is sacred
whereas American Protestants

01:40:40.180 --> 01:40:43.240
very clearly treat the
English translations

01:40:43.240 --> 01:40:46.490
as being the actual
word of God and may

01:40:46.490 --> 01:40:47.790
or may not know anything --

01:40:47.790 --> 01:40:49.090
&gt;&gt; Male speaker: Yeah.

01:40:49.090 --> 01:40:50.390
&gt;&gt; Lincoln Mullen: --
about the Greek and Hebrew.

01:40:50.390 --> 01:40:53.330
One of the things that I
definitely want to do is drawing

01:40:53.330 --> 01:40:56.180
on the work of Peter [inaudible]
and others who have written

01:40:56.180 --> 01:40:59.810
about biblical translations in
the United States to try to get

01:40:59.810 --> 01:41:02.570
at these many sort of
different versions of the bible

01:41:02.570 --> 01:41:05.580
to see how they come
to be quoted over time.

01:41:05.580 --> 01:41:06.880
&gt;&gt; Valerie Cooper: It
seems to me that embedded

01:41:06.880 --> 01:41:09.450
in your question is an
understanding that the text --

01:41:09.450 --> 01:41:12.840
the biblical text can shape
culture and life even for people

01:41:12.840 --> 01:41:17.800
who don't believe the miraculous
aspects of the stories

01:41:17.800 --> 01:41:19.100
that are being told, right?

01:41:19.100 --> 01:41:23.370
And so, it seems clear
to me that one of the way

01:41:23.370 --> 01:41:27.150
to study scripture is
its impact on a culture.

01:41:27.150 --> 01:41:31.170
And in the context of
West Africa, for example,

01:41:31.170 --> 01:41:35.270
the ways that missionizing
then shapes

01:41:35.270 --> 01:41:38.380
and ultimately perhaps
even distorts the cultures

01:41:38.380 --> 01:41:39.950
that were existing there, right?

01:41:39.950 --> 01:41:43.740
I mean, that's I think a very
appropriate way of thinking

01:41:43.740 --> 01:41:45.810
about the biblical text.

01:41:45.810 --> 01:41:48.760
Another way of thinking about
it is the ways that auth -

01:41:48.760 --> 01:41:50.920
West African authors
often use the text, right?

01:41:50.920 --> 01:41:54.870
Or speak to it, or
speak against it, right?

01:41:54.870 --> 01:41:56.270
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: Do we
have any other questions?

01:41:56.270 --> 01:41:58.940
Yeah?

01:41:58.940 --> 01:42:01.600
&gt;&gt; Female speaker: This
question is for Dr. Mullen.

01:42:01.600 --> 01:42:03.220
I really love your data sets

01:42:03.220 --> 01:42:09.600
and I think it's innovative how
you're using original documents

01:42:09.600 --> 01:42:13.970
and using quantitative analysis
to enhance the study of history.

01:42:13.970 --> 01:42:20.090
Your time series -- the one
that's from 1840-1910 that talks

01:42:20.090 --> 01:42:24.810
about the amount -- the number
of quotations of the bible.

01:42:24.810 --> 01:42:29.760
Do you view that as a good
empirical proxy for the level

01:42:29.760 --> 01:42:32.760
of religiosity in
the United States?

01:42:32.760 --> 01:42:36.440
Would that be something that
other scholars could use

01:42:36.440 --> 01:42:40.520
as a good proxy variable to
measure the wax and waning

01:42:40.520 --> 01:42:43.250
of lignosity [assumed spelling]?

01:42:43.250 --> 01:42:44.550
&gt;&gt; Lincoln Mullen: Thank you.

01:42:44.550 --> 01:42:45.850
That's a very interesting
question.

01:42:45.850 --> 01:42:48.850
And I don't think that
you could really use it

01:42:48.850 --> 01:42:53.910
as a direct measure of lignosity
where we always have the things

01:42:53.910 --> 01:42:56.000
that we can study and the
things we want to know about.

01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:57.360
And there's a distance
between them

01:42:57.360 --> 01:43:00.290
and I think we'd be too
many leaps away from that.

01:43:00.290 --> 01:43:04.060
I think we'd be better off to
look at things like affiliation

01:43:04.060 --> 01:43:06.360
and so on which is
difficult to do,

01:43:06.360 --> 01:43:08.680
but is -- it's possible to do.

01:43:08.680 --> 01:43:10.510
One thing I want to point
out about these charts

01:43:10.510 --> 01:43:14.100
that may not be obvious
especially when they're flashing

01:43:14.100 --> 01:43:19.180
by on the screen is that
the number of quotations

01:43:19.180 --> 01:43:21.680
on newspaper pages is
large in the aggregate,

01:43:21.680 --> 01:43:26.270
but the actual rate of quotation
is relatively low when you sort

01:43:26.270 --> 01:43:28.420
of divide it by the
number of pages.

01:43:28.420 --> 01:43:29.720
It's not so much like --

01:43:29.720 --> 01:43:32.360
we can think of it in
very broad brush terms

01:43:32.360 --> 01:43:34.160
as is it one quotation
per column?

01:43:34.160 --> 01:43:37.020
Is it one quotation per paper?

01:43:37.020 --> 01:43:38.860
Is it one per page?

01:43:38.860 --> 01:43:40.170
Is it one per --
quotation per issue?

01:43:40.170 --> 01:43:42.650
And I think it's more like one
quotation every other issue

01:43:42.650 --> 01:43:43.950
or something like that.

01:43:43.950 --> 01:43:48.830
So, it's actually a pretty
low rate of quotation.

01:43:48.830 --> 01:43:51.160
[inaudible], folks.

01:43:51.160 --> 01:43:53.300
[ Coughing ]

01:43:53.300 --> 01:43:55.730
&gt;&gt; Female speaker: I wanted
to ask Professor Gutjahr

01:43:55.730 --> 01:43:59.520
in particular, in
the United States,

01:43:59.520 --> 01:44:05.980
of course there is often a
correlation between people

01:44:05.980 --> 01:44:10.640
who consider themselves
biblical Christians and people

01:44:10.640 --> 01:44:15.580
who don't take seriously the
threat of climate change.

01:44:15.580 --> 01:44:19.530
So, perhaps that is --
ought to be sufficient

01:44:19.530 --> 01:44:20.830
to answer my question.

01:44:20.830 --> 01:44:23.610
Nevertheless, I'm curious as
to whether you've yet come

01:44:23.610 --> 01:44:28.410
across any use of the Noah's
Ark story as a metaphor

01:44:28.410 --> 01:44:32.110
for the kinds of choices
human beings may have to face

01:44:32.110 --> 01:44:37.120
if climate change moves
forward, and other life

01:44:37.120 --> 01:44:41.010
on this planet is tremendously
threatened, and imperiled

01:44:41.010 --> 01:44:45.640
as it will be if we
don't deal with that?

01:44:45.640 --> 01:44:47.540
&gt;&gt; Paul Gutjahr: It's --
that's a great question.

01:44:47.540 --> 01:44:50.010
Okay. They --

01:44:50.010 --> 01:44:51.310
[ Sigh ]

01:44:51.310 --> 01:44:54.130
-- there's different
ways to answer it.

01:44:54.130 --> 01:44:58.860
Perhaps the simplest one is
Noah's Ark gets invoked a lot

01:44:58.860 --> 01:45:00.370
in popular discourse

01:45:00.370 --> 01:45:03.260
and evangelical
environmentalism, okay?

01:45:03.260 --> 01:45:05.010
But what --

01:45:05.010 --> 01:45:06.310
[ Background noise ]

01:45:06.310 --> 01:45:08.330
-- if you really want to look
at kind of scholarly treatments

01:45:08.330 --> 01:45:12.730
of the passage or
not so much, no.

01:45:12.730 --> 01:45:15.710
People really like it as
a trope, and you're going

01:45:15.710 --> 01:45:20.570
to see it in popular talks,
and fundraising materials,

01:45:20.570 --> 01:45:24.760
etc. But as far as the
scholar really, you know,

01:45:24.760 --> 01:45:28.020
some kind of exogenesis [assumed
spelling] out of the article.

01:45:28.020 --> 01:45:30.620
It becomes much more
of a metaphor for them

01:45:30.620 --> 01:45:34.760
and if I'm wrong on that I'd
love somebody to point me

01:45:34.760 --> 01:45:37.270
to stuff where it's more -- it's
been treated more seriously.

01:45:37.270 --> 01:45:38.570
But Noah's Ark is -- -

01:45:38.570 --> 01:45:44.120
I could've easily done a
sixth moment on Noah's Ark

01:45:44.120 --> 01:45:46.890
and environmentalism because
there's just a lot of concern

01:45:46.890 --> 01:45:48.190
that we're going to need an ark.

Over here.

01:45:52.820 --> 01:45:54.120
Gordon's got a question.

01:45:54.120 --> 01:45:55.420
The mic's coming.

01:45:55.420 --> 01:45:56.970
&gt;&gt; Gordon: I think one
of the themes that comes

01:45:56.970 --> 01:46:00.740
through from these papers
is the tension that exists

01:46:00.740 --> 01:46:04.810
between you might say
Democracy and religiosity

01:46:04.810 --> 01:46:07.700
or I should say the
secularization

01:46:07.700 --> 01:46:12.170
which is elite driven
and democracy.

01:46:12.170 --> 01:46:16.990
Often, elitists are stunned by
the extent of the religiosity

01:46:16.990 --> 01:46:18.730
that exists among common people

01:46:18.730 --> 01:46:20.770
and I don't mean
just in the present.

01:46:20.770 --> 01:46:26.280
I mean, 1821 Jefferson
commented to a friend,

01:46:26.280 --> 01:46:28.700
"There's not a young
man now alive

01:46:28.700 --> 01:46:30.010
who won't die a Unitarian."

01:46:30.010 --> 01:46:31.310
[ Laughter ]

01:46:31.310 --> 01:46:32.610
Well, how wrong could he be?

01:46:32.610 --> 01:46:33.940
This is one of the factors

01:46:33.940 --> 01:46:37.000
and the Methodists are
growing by leaps and bounds.

01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:40.040
He simply did not
understand the middle

01:46:40.040 --> 01:46:41.650
of the country if you will.

01:46:41.650 --> 01:46:43.930
And so, I think there's
that tension

01:46:43.930 --> 01:46:45.490
and certainly that's
what's happening.

01:46:45.490 --> 01:46:49.300
The culture -- now there's
a cultural war that goes on.

01:46:49.300 --> 01:46:51.590
It's going on in Europe and
they're far more advanced

01:46:51.590 --> 01:46:53.500
in their secularization.

01:46:53.500 --> 01:46:56.860
They're also less democratic
than the United States.

01:46:56.860 --> 01:47:00.010

that I'd be interested

01:47:00.010 --> 01:47:01.310
in the panel talking about.

Recent scholarship
has suggested though

01:47:13.700 --> 01:47:17.590
that secularization is happening
here in the U.S. particularly

01:47:17.590 --> 01:47:22.180
with the rise of the
nones -- N-O-N-E-S --

01:47:22.180 --> 01:47:25.340
millennials and others with
no religious affiliation.

01:47:25.340 --> 01:47:26.640
What's interesting to me --

01:47:26.640 --> 01:47:30.600
and I have a colleague
who's studying these --

01:47:30.600 --> 01:47:35.410
we think when you hear "none"
you think atheist or agnostic.

01:47:35.410 --> 01:47:38.460
But some of these
are post-evangelical.

01:47:38.460 --> 01:47:41.560
So, one of the consequences
perhaps --

01:47:41.560 --> 01:47:45.040
it's very early days
yet to know --

01:47:45.040 --> 01:47:46.610
-- this scholarship
is being done now.

01:47:46.610 --> 01:47:49.890
But one of the suggestions
is that the --

01:47:49.890 --> 01:47:55.350
perhaps a consequence of
the hyper polarization

01:47:55.350 --> 01:48:00.430
of churches is that churches
are losing their young people,

01:48:00.430 --> 01:48:01.730
right?

01:48:01.730 --> 01:48:06.380
So, that we may have in the 2016
election exacerbated the growth

01:48:06.380 --> 01:48:07.680
of the nones.

01:48:07.680 --> 01:48:13.140
So, I'm not sure initially
that we are -- I mean, we --

01:48:13.140 --> 01:48:18.130
certainly we're a very religious
people in our practice.

01:48:18.130 --> 01:48:21.890

back 10 years from now and say

01:48:21.890 --> 01:48:25.010
that this was a turning point.

School of Government

01:48:30.370 --> 01:48:37.140
and a presenter asked why I
thought it was that presidents

01:48:37.140 --> 01:48:40.450
so rarely quote scripture.

01:48:40.450 --> 01:48:46.590

about it for a minute.

01:48:46.590 --> 01:48:49.340

quoted scripture, right?

nervous when for example,

01:49:19.450 --> 01:49:21.310
that when black people
are quoting scripture,

01:49:21.310 --> 01:49:24.090
they're quoting scripture
about liberation and not

01:49:24.090 --> 01:49:27.260
about social control, and
that they're concerned

01:49:27.260 --> 01:49:31.560
about elites quoting
scripture is that it may be

01:49:31.560 --> 01:49:33.410
about social control,

01:49:33.410 --> 01:49:37.800
about taking away someone
else's rights, right?

01:49:37.800 --> 01:49:42.490
I'm not sure that elites are
necessarily less religious,

01:49:42.490 --> 01:49:46.380
but I think that there might
be some social pressure not

01:49:46.380 --> 01:49:48.880
to show it in the
same sorts of ways.

01:49:48.880 --> 01:49:51.060
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: Mark, did
you want to say something?

01:49:51.060 --> 01:49:52.360
&gt;&gt; Mark Noll: The question

01:49:52.360 --> 01:49:55.300
about demarketization [assumed
spelling]and public religiosity

01:49:55.300 --> 01:49:57.870
is what drew me to Tom
Payne because you have

01:49:57.870 --> 01:50:01.340
to have an explanation
that -- or it's good --

01:50:01.340 --> 01:50:05.000
it would be good to have an
explanation for why coming

01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:08.510
out of a Protestant sect --
common Protestant British stock,

01:50:08.510 --> 01:50:14.590
you really do get a different
approach to public guidance

01:50:14.590 --> 01:50:17.370
and persuasion in the
United States 19th Century

01:50:17.370 --> 01:50:20.330
as opposed to Britain.

01:50:20.330 --> 01:50:23.740
I think the reason is there
needed to be some kind

01:50:23.740 --> 01:50:26.830
of adjustment after Christendom

01:50:26.830 --> 01:50:31.720
of the Anglican sort was
dismissed for a religious people

01:50:31.720 --> 01:50:36.670
to be religious and the way
that which it happened was

01:50:36.670 --> 01:50:41.850
through the expansion of popular
persuasion, the proliferation

01:50:41.850 --> 01:50:45.360
of newspapers, and the
publication of the bible

01:50:45.360 --> 01:50:50.530
which in the U.K. remains
a royal copyright way

01:50:50.530 --> 01:50:51.830
into the 19th Century.

01:50:51.830 --> 01:50:56.530
In the United States, the
first printed bible --

01:50:56.530 --> 01:51:00.400
the people who wanted to first
print the bible asked Congress

01:51:00.400 --> 01:51:01.700
for their permission.

01:51:01.700 --> 01:51:05.430
This was 1785-'6 or something

01:51:05.430 --> 01:51:08.040
and the Continental
Congress is -- I don't know.

01:51:08.040 --> 01:51:10.010
I mean, why are you asking me?

01:51:10.010 --> 01:51:11.310
[ Laughter ]

01:51:11.310 --> 01:51:17.010
And then, there's a good
publication rate in the 1790's.

01:51:17.010 --> 01:51:18.310
[ Coughing ]

01:51:18.310 --> 01:51:20.460
And then, after 1800 the
bible publication explodes all

01:51:20.460 --> 01:51:21.760
over the country.

01:51:21.760 --> 01:51:23.060
Overwhelmingly King
James version.

01:51:23.060 --> 01:51:24.360
I mean, there's a few
[inaudible] versions

01:51:24.360 --> 01:51:27.810
in the 1790's, but almost
nothing until the 1830's.

01:51:27.810 --> 01:51:31.400
And so, it's the popularization
of publication going

01:51:31.400 --> 01:51:35.030
with the popularization of
persuasion that I think makes

01:51:35.030 --> 01:51:36.330
for American religiosity.

01:51:36.330 --> 01:51:38.100
There's also a lot of pushback.

01:51:38.100 --> 01:51:41.720
I mean, there are a lot of
Payne-ites who remain alive,

01:51:41.720 --> 01:51:43.020
but they're always shouted out.

01:51:43.020 --> 01:51:45.550
They're always shouted down.

01:51:45.550 --> 01:51:47.690
&gt;&gt; Valerie Cooper: Let
me also say that in terms

01:51:47.690 --> 01:51:52.760
of popular religious expression
in the U.S., it's interesting

01:51:52.760 --> 01:51:55.840
that it produces a kind of
a political divide, right?

01:51:55.840 --> 01:52:01.010
One of the easiest ways to
identify a Republican voter is

01:52:01.010 --> 01:52:05.020
that he or she goes to
church more than once a week.

01:52:05.020 --> 01:52:07.200
The easiest way to
identify a demo --

01:52:07.200 --> 01:52:08.500
one of the easiest ways
to identify one of --

01:52:08.500 --> 01:52:09.800
something like 90
percent, right?

01:52:09.800 --> 01:52:13.590
One of the easiest ways to
identify a Democratic voter is

01:52:13.590 --> 01:52:17.080
that he or she goes to
a black church, right?

01:52:17.080 --> 01:52:20.760
So, they share the same
popular devotion to scripture

01:52:20.760 --> 01:52:25.430
and they are radically
opposed politically, right?

01:52:25.430 --> 01:52:28.900
So, when you talk
about popular devotion,

01:52:28.900 --> 01:52:31.790
we have to acknowledge
the partisan divide

01:52:31.790 --> 01:52:33.700
in popular devotion
today, right?

01:52:33.700 --> 01:52:36.960
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: There's
even some data from Gallop

01:52:36.960 --> 01:52:40.010
about people saying they go
to church, but actually don't.

01:52:40.010 --> 01:52:41.310
[ Laughter ]

01:52:41.310 --> 01:52:42.610
But that's important too, right?

01:52:42.610 --> 01:52:43.910
It's listed along those lines.

01:52:43.910 --> 01:52:45.680
If you feel the pressure to say
you go once or twice a week,

01:52:45.680 --> 01:52:46.980
that's a significant --

01:52:46.980 --> 01:52:49.000
that could be a significant
thing politically irrespective

01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:51.600
of whether it's true.

01:52:51.600 --> 01:52:53.970
This lady here?

01:52:53.970 --> 01:52:58.330
You've got a microphone
coming right behind you.

01:52:58.330 --> 01:52:59.630
&gt;&gt; Female speaker: Thank you.

01:52:59.630 --> 01:53:01.790
I just had a question if --

01:53:01.790 --> 01:53:04.080
I hope it's not too
much of a deviation.

01:53:04.080 --> 01:53:09.990
But I am in the middle of
reading Tony Morrison's novel

01:53:09.990 --> 01:53:15.550
"Beloved" and I was wondering
if you could connect the history

01:53:15.550 --> 01:53:20.620
of the bible talking to what's
happening in that novel?

01:53:21.710 --> 01:53:23.210
&gt;&gt; Valerie Cooper: So,
my favorite scene from

01:53:23.210 --> 01:53:27.970
"Beloved" is Baby Sugs
Holy [assumed spelling]

01:53:27.970 --> 01:53:31.890
and that service that she has
sort of in the hush harbors

01:53:31.890 --> 01:53:34.640
that Historian, Albert
[inaudible] spoke

01:53:34.640 --> 01:53:38.510
about where she says, "Out
there they don't love you.

01:53:38.510 --> 01:53:40.030
They don't love your flesh.

01:53:40.030 --> 01:53:41.330
You should love your flesh"

01:53:41.330 --> 01:53:44.560
and she preaches essentially
a woman inspiration

01:53:44.560 --> 01:53:50.010
and still sermon about
loving yourself despite -

01:53:50.010 --> 01:53:51.310
[ Coughing ]

01:53:51.310 --> 01:53:53.490
-- the difficulties of
living in the world.

01:53:53.490 --> 01:53:56.690
Ultimately, "Beloved"
is a story about people

01:53:56.690 --> 01:53:59.670
who have been haunted by
the legacy of slavery.

01:53:59.670 --> 01:54:01.260
It takes place almost
exclusively

01:54:01.260 --> 01:54:03.150
after slavery has ended.

01:54:03.150 --> 01:54:07.430
But we learn of someone
who has scars on her back

01:54:07.430 --> 01:54:10.340
like a choked [assumed
spelling] cherry tree, right?

01:54:10.340 --> 01:54:12.950
She carries it -- these
scars in her body.

01:54:12.950 --> 01:54:14.940
And the question
is how do you live

01:54:14.940 --> 01:54:19.400
into liberation having
experienced what you did?

01:54:19.400 --> 01:54:23.480
And Morrison wrote the
novel after having read --

01:54:23.480 --> 01:54:24.840
I mean, as a -- after --

01:54:24.840 --> 01:54:26.950
as a student at Howard
University learning

01:54:26.950 --> 01:54:28.750
that it was a true story,

01:54:28.750 --> 01:54:32.890
that a woman escaping
slavery was retaken --

01:54:32.890 --> 01:54:34.340
or was about to be retaken --

01:54:34.340 --> 01:54:37.530
and began killing her
children rather than allow them

01:54:37.530 --> 01:54:38.950
to be taken back into slavery.

01:54:38.950 --> 01:54:40.250
And she's literally the --

01:54:40.250 --> 01:54:41.550
[ Coughing ]

01:54:41.550 --> 01:54:44.120
-- in the course of the
novel, she's literally haunted

01:54:44.120 --> 01:54:47.110
by the child she calls
"Beloved" -- the one she killed.

01:54:47.110 --> 01:54:50.280
Presumably, she would have
been committed to Psych rather

01:54:50.280 --> 01:54:56.310
than be retaken, but
they stopped her, right?

01:54:56.310 --> 01:55:01.300
So, I would say that Morrison's
conception of scripture --

01:55:01.300 --> 01:55:03.600
I would point you not only to
that one, but also to "Song

01:55:03.600 --> 01:55:08.880
of Solomon" where the text
is used utterly randomly.

01:55:08.880 --> 01:55:10.770
People get names
just by, you know,

01:55:10.770 --> 01:55:13.920
open the bible and
poking at words.

01:55:13.920 --> 01:55:17.780
I think that as a scholar --

01:55:17.780 --> 01:55:22.420
as an author - Morrison
challenges perhaps some

01:55:22.420 --> 01:55:24.670
of the devotion to
the bible that is

01:55:24.670 --> 01:55:27.680
in the African American
community.

01:55:27.680 --> 01:55:31.230
I think she challenges
us to ask the question,

01:55:31.230 --> 01:55:33.390
"Is this text helpful

01:55:33.390 --> 01:55:36.020
to the body politic
-- to the community?"

01:55:36.020 --> 01:55:40.290
I think she would agree with
Howard Thurman's grandmother,

01:55:40.290 --> 01:55:43.010
"If it's not life
giving, throw it out."

01:55:43.010 --> 01:55:44.310
[ Laughter ]

01:55:44.310 --> 01:55:48.070
And so, she gives us a
very progressive preacher

01:55:48.070 --> 01:55:52.180
in Baby Sug's Holy who is not --

01:55:52.180 --> 01:55:56.040
who is preaching a
text that is her body.

01:55:56.040 --> 01:55:57.400
If "Beloved" is a text

01:55:57.400 --> 01:56:02.050
about people whose bodies
bear the scars of slavery,

01:56:02.050 --> 01:56:07.890
Baby Sugs is preaching
holiness out of her body.

01:56:07.890 --> 01:56:12.070
She is -- if -- to borrow the,
you know, the movie's thing,

01:56:12.070 --> 01:56:15.560
"If Jesus is an ark, I
should get in to", right?

01:56:15.560 --> 01:56:21.420
She's embodying holiness,
the Holy Spirit,

01:56:21.420 --> 01:56:24.050
the transformative power of God.

01:56:24.050 --> 01:56:27.150
And so, Morrison makes the
point that she's unordained,

01:56:27.150 --> 01:56:30.920
that she's -- that no one's
called her, but God which kind

01:56:30.920 --> 01:56:35.070
of suggests I think perhaps how
lonely it is to get out there

01:56:35.070 --> 01:56:40.130
and do that -- to preach that
against church traditions

01:56:40.130 --> 01:56:44.490
that don't ordain women
against all of the difficulties.

01:56:44.490 --> 01:56:47.380
Baby Sugs is out there
preaching life in the midst

01:56:47.380 --> 01:56:49.080
of a text about death.

01:56:49.080 --> 01:56:51.620
John Haskell: Thank
you all very much.

01:56:51.620 --> 01:56:54.970
I want to draw your attention
to one event we have coming up.

01:56:54.970 --> 01:56:59.810
I think a crowd like this might
be interested in a July 19 event

01:56:59.810 --> 01:57:01.340
in Coolidge Auditorium
where our -

01:57:01.340 --> 01:57:04.470
where we will be discussing
the history and relevance

01:57:04.470 --> 01:57:08.090
of the American Dream with Ann
[assumed spelling] Compton of --

01:57:08.090 --> 01:57:10.580
formerly of ABC News will
be moderating a discussion

01:57:10.580 --> 01:57:13.780
with E.J. Deon [assumed
spelling] and Ross [inaudible]

01:57:13.780 --> 01:57:15.620
of the New York Times.

01:57:15.620 --> 01:57:20.860
And - with questions generated
by Ann, but also by students

01:57:20.860 --> 01:57:23.820
across the United States,
but particularly in Hawaii

01:57:23.820 --> 01:57:26.240
because the In A Way [assumed
spelling] Foundation is

01:57:26.240 --> 01:57:27.540
supporting that event.

01:57:27.540 --> 01:57:28.840
So anyway, I hope
to see you there.

01:57:28.840 --> 01:57:31.320
You'll get, you know,
notification about it.

01:57:31.320 --> 01:57:33.370
But thank you all
again very much.

01:57:33.370 --> 01:57:35.510
This is a fascinating
discussion.
