form of salt water and in fact most of
 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.499
form of salt water and in fact most of
the planet is covered by salt water so

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509
the planet is covered by salt water so
 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.120

that water and we have actually figured
 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:20.810
that water and we have actually figured
out the technology it's called

and to deliver it to bring it to
 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:38.190
and to deliver it to bring it to
people's homes and to their farms then

00:16:09.780 --> 00:16:09.790
talk about food next week if it wasn't
 

00:16:09.790 --> 00:16:11.310
talk about food next week if it wasn't
for industrial farming we would all be

00:16:11.310 --> 00:16:11.320
for industrial farming we would all be
 

00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:13.590
for industrial farming we would all be
starving to death and so we need those

00:16:13.590 --> 00:16:13.600
starving to death and so we need those
 

00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:15.960
starving to death and so we need those
technologies but we need to make them

00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:15.970
technologies but we need to make them
 

00:16:15.970 --> 00:16:19.500
technologies but we need to make them
more sustainable now the ocean is also

00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:19.510
more sustainable now the ocean is also
 

00:16:19.510 --> 00:16:22.800
more sustainable now the ocean is also

morning in the summer they have to go
 

00:16:35.590 --> 00:16:38.160
morning in the summer they have to go
and rake the beach and clean up all the

they don't even think about it anymore
 

00:16:42.790 --> 00:16:45.900
they don't even think about it anymore
you got guys with these beach rakes and

00:16:45.900 --> 00:16:45.910
you got guys with these beach rakes and
 

00:16:45.910 --> 00:16:48.120
you got guys with these beach rakes and
then you have kids with green garbage

00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:48.130

we've seen loss of biodiversity from
 

00:17:02.020 --> 00:17:04.320
we've seen loss of biodiversity from
overfishing and also the practice of

00:17:04.320 --> 00:17:04.330
overfishing and also the practice of
 

00:17:04.330 --> 00:17:06.329

take water in a ship say in one part of
 

00:17:14.110 --> 00:17:15.750
take water in a ship say in one part of
the world and then you dump the water

00:17:15.750 --> 00:17:15.760
the world and then you dump the water
 

00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:18.300
the world and then you dump the water
out in another part of the world and so

00:17:18.300 --> 00:17:18.310
out in another part of the world and so
 

00:17:18.310 --> 00:17:20.490
out in another part of the world and so
the ecosystems of this other part of the

so this issue of water quality is

00:17:38.370 --> 00:17:38.380
so this issue of water quality is
 

00:17:38.380 --> 00:17:41.370
so this issue of water quality is
important and is a growing issue

00:17:41.370 --> 00:17:41.380

and again a problem that can be solved

00:17:46.420 --> 00:17:46.430
and again a problem that can be solved
 

00:17:46.430 --> 00:17:48.340
and again a problem that can be solved
with better technology and better

with better technology and better
 

00:17:48.350 --> 00:17:50.890
with better technology and better
management practices which leads me to

supply and sewage treatment when we
built the first sewage treatment plants

00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:06.410
built the first sewage treatment plants
 

00:18:06.410 --> 00:18:08.740

in New York City we had what are called

00:18:08.740 --> 00:18:08.750
in New York City we had what are called
 

00:18:08.750 --> 00:18:10.990
in New York City we had what are called
what's called primary treatment which

00:18:10.990 --> 00:18:11.000
what's called primary treatment which
 

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:13.510
what's called primary treatment which
was essentially a screen that kept the

00:18:13.510 --> 00:18:13.520
was essentially a screen that kept the
 

00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:16.180
was essentially a screen that kept the
junk from going into jamaica bay then we

00:18:16.180 --> 00:18:16.190
junk from going into jamaica bay then we
 

00:18:16.190 --> 00:18:18.250
junk from going into jamaica bay then we
created secondary treatment where we

00:18:18.250 --> 00:18:18.260
created secondary treatment where we
 

00:18:18.260 --> 00:18:21.610
created secondary treatment where we
evaporated some of the contaminants and

00:18:21.610 --> 00:18:21.620
evaporated some of the contaminants and
 

00:18:21.620 --> 00:18:24.010
evaporated some of the contaminants and
then created a sludge and now we have

00:18:24.010 --> 00:18:24.020
then created a sludge and now we have
 

00:18:24.020 --> 00:18:25.780
then created a sludge and now we have
what's called tertiary treatment where

00:18:25.780 --> 00:18:25.790
what's called tertiary treatment where
 

00:18:25.790 --> 00:18:28.240
what's called tertiary treatment where
we apply technology to actually change

pretty interesting here some of the
older treatment plants in Brooklyn take

00:18:38.110 --> 00:18:38.120
older treatment plants in Brooklyn take
 

00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:40.660
older treatment plants in Brooklyn take
their sludge and bring it to the

00:18:40.660 --> 00:18:40.670
their sludge and bring it to the
 

00:18:40.670 --> 00:18:43.000
their sludge and bring it to the
