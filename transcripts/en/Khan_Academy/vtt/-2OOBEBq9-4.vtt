00:00:00.363 --> 00:00:02.348
- "Ana played five rounds of golf

00:00:02.348 --> 00:00:04.559
"and her lowest score was an 80.

00:00:04.559 --> 00:00:08.425
" The scores of the first four rounds and the lowest round

00:00:08.425 --> 00:00:10.589
"are shown in the following dot plot."

00:00:10.589 --> 00:00:12.720
And we see it right over here.

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:14.328
The lowest round she scores an 80,

00:00:14.328 --> 00:00:16.789
she also scores a 90 once, a 92 once,

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:19.426
a 94 once, and a 96 once.

00:00:19.426 --> 00:00:22.286
"It was discovered that Ana broke some rules when she scored

00:00:22.286 --> 00:00:25.385
"80, so that score", so I guess cheating didn't help her,

00:00:25.385 --> 00:00:27.684
"so that score will be removed from the data set."

00:00:27.684 --> 00:00:29.631
So they removed that 80 right over there.

00:00:29.631 --> 00:00:32.810
We're just left with the scores from the other four rounds.

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:35.286
"How will the removal of the lowest round

00:00:35.286 --> 00:00:38.025
"affect the mean and the median?"

00:00:38.025 --> 00:00:40.564
So let's actually think about the median first.

00:00:40.564 --> 00:00:42.528
So the median is the middle number.

00:00:42.528 --> 00:00:44.741
So over here when you had five data points

00:00:44.741 --> 00:00:46.947
the middle data point is gonna be the one

00:00:46.947 --> 00:00:49.130
that has two to the left and two to the right.

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:52.857
So the median up here is going to be 92.

00:00:52.857 --> 00:00:57.479
The median up there is 92.

00:00:57.479 --> 00:00:59.372
And what's the median once you remove this?

00:00:59.372 --> 00:01:01.100
Now you only have four data points.

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:02.463
When you're trying to find the median

00:01:02.463 --> 00:01:03.926
of an even number of numbers

00:01:03.926 --> 00:01:05.817
you look at the middle two numbers.

00:01:05.817 --> 00:01:08.811
So that's a 92 and a 94.

00:01:08.811 --> 00:01:10.529
And then you take the average of them.

00:01:10.529 --> 00:01:12.934
You go halfway between them to figure out the median.

00:01:12.934 --> 00:01:15.981
So the median here is going to be,

00:01:15.981 --> 00:01:17.572
let me do that a little bit clearer.

00:01:17.572 --> 00:01:18.754
The median over here is going to be

00:01:18.754 --> 00:01:22.088
halfway between 92 and 94 which is 93.

00:01:22.088 --> 00:01:26.865
So the median, the median is 93.

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.980
Median is 93.

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:32.180
So removing the lowest data point

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:35.272
in this case increased the median.

00:01:35.272 --> 00:01:37.910
So the median, let me write it down here.

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:40.263
So the median increased by a little bit.

00:01:40.854 --> 00:01:42.693
The median increases.

00:01:42.693 --> 00:01:45.638
Now what's going to happen to the mean?

00:01:45.638 --> 00:01:48.677
What's going to happen to the mean?

00:01:48.677 --> 00:01:50.535
Well one way to think about it without having to do

00:01:50.535 --> 00:01:53.965
any calculations is if you remove a number

00:01:53.965 --> 00:01:57.275
that is lower than the mean, lower than the existing mean,

00:01:57.275 --> 00:01:59.098
and I haven't calculated what the existing mean is,

00:01:59.098 --> 00:02:02.268
but if you remove that the mean is going to go up.

00:02:02.268 --> 00:02:04.182
The mean is going to go up.

00:02:04.182 --> 00:02:05.691
So hopefully that gives you some intuition.

00:02:05.691 --> 00:02:07.814
If you removed a number that's larger than the mean

00:02:07.814 --> 00:02:11.959
your mean is, your mean is going to go down

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:14.010
cause you don't have that large number anymore.

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.420
If you remove a number that's lower than the mean,

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:19.283
well you take that out, you don't have that small number

00:02:20.031 --> 00:02:22.590
bringing the average down and so the mean will go up.

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.638
But let's verify it mathematically.

00:02:24.638 --> 00:02:26.986
So let's calculate the mean over here.

00:02:26.986 --> 00:02:30.550
So we're gonna add 80, plus 90,

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:37.247
plus 92, plus 94, plus 96.

00:02:37.247 --> 00:02:38.859
Those are our data points.

00:02:38.859 --> 00:02:43.581
And that gets us: two plus four is six, plus six is 12.

00:02:43.581 --> 00:02:47.801
And then we have one plus eight is nine, and this is,

00:02:47.801 --> 00:02:49.798
so these are nine and then you have another nine,

00:02:49.798 --> 00:02:51.237
another nine, another nine, another nine.

00:02:51.237 --> 00:02:54.385
You essentially have, this is five nines right over here.

00:02:54.385 --> 00:02:59.644
So this is going to be 452.

00:02:59.644 --> 00:03:03.292
So that's the sum of the scores of these five rounds,

00:03:03.292 --> 00:03:05.730
and then you divide it by the number of rounds you have.

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.588
So it would be 452 divided by five.

00:03:08.588 --> 00:03:13.839
So 452 divided by five

00:03:13.839 --> 00:03:15.875
is going to give us, five goes into,

00:03:15.875 --> 00:03:18.564
it doesn't go into four, it goes into 45 nine times.

00:03:18.564 --> 00:03:23.127
Nine times five is 45, you subtract, get zero,

00:03:23.127 --> 00:03:24.459
bring down the two.

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:27.628
Five goes into two zero times, zero times five is,

00:03:27.628 --> 00:03:29.845
zero times five is zero, subtract.

00:03:29.845 --> 00:03:34.043
You have two left over, so you can say that the mean here,

00:03:34.043 --> 00:03:38.837
the mean here is 90 and 2/5.

00:03:39.645 --> 00:03:43.057
Not nine and 2/5, 90 and 2/5.

00:03:43.057 --> 00:03:46.230
So the mean is right around here.

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:49.943
So that's the mean of these data points right over there.

00:03:49.943 --> 00:03:53.295
And if you remove it what is the mean going to be?

00:03:53.295 --> 00:03:57.996
So here we're just going to take our 90, plus our 92,

00:03:57.996 --> 00:04:03.075
plus our 94, plus our 96, add 'em together.

00:04:03.075 --> 00:04:06.937
So let's see, two plus four plus six is 12.

00:04:06.937 --> 00:04:10.087
And then you add these together you're gonna get 37.

00:04:10.087 --> 00:04:13.045
372 divided by four, cause I have

00:04:13.045 --> 00:04:15.007
four data points now, not five.

00:04:15.007 --> 00:04:16.853
Four goes into, let me do this

00:04:16.853 --> 00:04:18.370
in a place where you can see it.

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:23.203
So four goes into 372,

00:04:23.203 --> 00:04:25.141
goes into 37 nine times.

00:04:25.141 --> 00:04:28.368
Nine times four is 36, subtract, you get a one.

00:04:28.368 --> 00:04:31.139
Bring down the two, it goes exactly three times.

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:33.256
Three times four is 12.

00:04:33.256 --> 00:04:34.544
You have no remainder.

00:04:34.544 --> 00:04:36.379
So the median and the mean here

00:04:36.379 --> 00:04:38.997
are both, so this is also the mean.

00:04:38.997 --> 00:04:41.529
The mean here is also 93.

00:04:41.529 --> 00:04:43.820
So you see that the median,

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:46.676
the median went from 92 to 93, it increased.

00:04:46.676 --> 00:04:50.321
The mean went from 90 and 2/5 to 93.

00:04:50.321 --> 00:04:53.589
So the mean increased by more than the median.

00:04:53.589 --> 00:04:56.433
They both increased but the mean increased by more.

00:04:56.433 --> 00:04:58.515
And it makes sense cause this number was way,

00:04:58.515 --> 00:05:00.828
way below all of these over here.

00:05:00.828 --> 00:05:02.349
So you could imagine if you take this out

00:05:02.349 --> 00:05:04.235
the mean should increase by a good amount.

00:05:04.235 --> 00:05:05.891
But let's see which of these choices

00:05:05.891 --> 00:05:07.955
are what we just described.

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:11.541
"Both the mean and the median will decrease", nope.

00:05:11.541 --> 00:05:14.734
"Both the mean and the median will decrease", nope.

00:05:14.734 --> 00:05:16.932
"Both the mean and the median will increase,

00:05:16.932 --> 00:05:19.927
"but the mean will increase by more than the median."

00:05:19.927 --> 00:05:23.155
That's exactly, that's exactly, what happened.

00:05:23.155 --> 00:05:26.957
The mean went from 90 and 2/5 or 90.4,

00:05:26.957 --> 00:05:30.776
went from 90.4 or 90 and 2/5 to 93.

00:05:30.776 --> 00:05:33.411
And then the median only increased by one.

00:05:33.411 --> 00:05:35.732
So this is the right answer.
