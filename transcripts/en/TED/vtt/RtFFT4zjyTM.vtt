00:00:12.788 --> 00:00:14.554
To kick the bucket,

00:00:14.578 --> 00:00:16.265
bite the dust,

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:18.412
cash in your chips,

00:00:18.436 --> 00:00:21.402
check out, depart, expire,

00:00:21.426 --> 00:00:22.946
launch into eternity ...

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.542
These are all euphemisms we use in humor

00:00:27.566 --> 00:00:31.153
to describe the one life event
we are all going to experience:

00:00:32.597 --> 00:00:33.747
death.

00:00:34.759 --> 00:00:37.746
But most of us don't want
to acknowledge death,

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.644
we don't want to plan for it,

00:00:39.668 --> 00:00:43.343
and we don't want to discuss it with
the most important people in our lives.

00:00:44.551 --> 00:00:47.682
I grew up in an Australian community
where people got old or sick

00:00:47.706 --> 00:00:48.857
and passed away,

00:00:48.881 --> 00:00:50.848
and only the adults attended the funeral.

00:00:51.495 --> 00:00:54.051
My parents would come home
looking sad and drained,

00:00:54.075 --> 00:00:55.860
but they didn't discuss it with us.

00:00:56.306 --> 00:00:59.653
So I was ignorant to death
and of the grieving process.

00:01:01.021 --> 00:01:03.168
At 15, I got my invitation.

00:01:03.872 --> 00:01:06.230
A dear neighbor who was like an aunt to me

00:01:06.254 --> 00:01:08.103
died suddenly of a heart attack,

00:01:08.127 --> 00:01:10.879
and I attended my first funeral
and did my first reading.

00:01:12.122 --> 00:01:16.900
I didn't know the tightness in my chest
and the dryness in my mouth was normal.

00:01:18.376 --> 00:01:21.812
The celebrant got some of the facts wrong,
and it made me really angry.

00:01:23.027 --> 00:01:25.788
He talked about how she loved knitting.

00:01:28.239 --> 00:01:29.390
Knitting.

00:01:29.414 --> 00:01:30.708
(Laughter)

00:01:30.732 --> 00:01:34.792
He didn't mention that, at 75,
she still mowed her own lawn,

00:01:34.816 --> 00:01:36.943
built an amazing fish pond
in her front yard

00:01:36.967 --> 00:01:38.450
and made her own ginger beer.

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.891
I'm pretty sure "keen knitter"

00:01:41.915 --> 00:01:44.231
isn't what she would
have chosen for her eulogy.

00:01:44.255 --> 00:01:46.238
(Laughter)

00:01:46.262 --> 00:01:49.563
I believe if we discuss death
as part of day-to-day living,

00:01:49.587 --> 00:01:52.945
we give ourselves the opportunity
to reflect on our core values,

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:54.914
share them with our loved ones,

00:01:54.938 --> 00:01:58.602
and then our survivors
can make informed decisions

00:01:58.626 --> 00:02:02.356
without fear or regret
of having failed to honor our legacy.

00:02:04.316 --> 00:02:08.038
I am blessed to lead a wonderful,
culturally diverse team,

00:02:08.062 --> 00:02:09.722
and in the last 12 months,

00:02:09.746 --> 00:02:11.865
we've lost five parents,

00:02:11.889 --> 00:02:13.904
including my own father,

00:02:13.928 --> 00:02:17.896
and most recently, a former colleague
who died at 41 from bowel cancer.

00:02:19.392 --> 00:02:21.666
We started having
open and frank conversations

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.245
about what we were experiencing.

00:02:24.027 --> 00:02:26.487
We talked about the practical stuff,

00:02:26.511 --> 00:02:28.225
the stuff no one prepares you for:

00:02:29.098 --> 00:02:31.136
dealing with government agencies,

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.214
hospitals, nursing homes,

00:02:33.238 --> 00:02:34.876
advanced care directives,

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:36.333
funeral directors

00:02:36.357 --> 00:02:39.055
and extended family members,

00:02:39.079 --> 00:02:40.652
(Laughter)

00:02:40.676 --> 00:02:43.062
making decisions about coffins,

00:02:43.086 --> 00:02:44.344
headstones,

00:02:44.368 --> 00:02:45.850
headstone wording,

00:02:45.874 --> 00:02:47.820
headstone font size,

00:02:47.844 --> 00:02:49.436
all while sleep-deprived.

00:02:50.834 --> 00:02:52.708
We also discussed some of the issues

00:02:52.732 --> 00:02:55.294
triggered by our various
cultural backgrounds,

00:02:55.318 --> 00:02:58.024
and we realized there can be
some significant differences

00:02:58.048 --> 00:03:00.222
in how we honor
the passing of a loved one.

00:03:01.504 --> 00:03:04.211
A great example of this
is "Sorry Business,"

00:03:04.235 --> 00:03:07.138
practiced by Aboriginal
and Torres Strait Islander people.

00:03:07.895 --> 00:03:09.980
During Sorry Business,

00:03:10.004 --> 00:03:13.765
family members will take on
specific roles and responsibilities,

00:03:13.789 --> 00:03:16.630
protocols such as limiting
the use of photographs,

00:03:16.654 --> 00:03:18.987
saying the name of the deceased,

00:03:19.011 --> 00:03:21.226
and holding a smoking ceremony

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:25.281
are all a sign of respect and allow
for a peaceful transition of the spirit.

00:03:26.642 --> 00:03:28.602
These customs can be a complete contrast

00:03:28.626 --> 00:03:31.094
to those we might practice
in Western cultures,

00:03:31.118 --> 00:03:33.285
where we would honor
the memory of a loved one

00:03:33.309 --> 00:03:35.895
by talking about them
and sharing photographs.

00:03:37.312 --> 00:03:39.882
So my lesson from this last year is,

00:03:39.906 --> 00:03:45.050
life would be a lot easier to live
if we talked about death now,

00:03:45.074 --> 00:03:46.335
while we're healthy.

00:03:47.066 --> 00:03:50.673
For most of us, we wait
until we are too emotional,

00:03:50.697 --> 00:03:52.197
too ill

00:03:52.221 --> 00:03:53.967
or too physically exhausted --

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:56.544
and then it's too late.

00:03:57.933 --> 00:04:02.067
Isn't it time we started taking ownership
of our finale on this earth?

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:04.266
So let's get going.

00:04:05.581 --> 00:04:07.517
Do you know what you want when you die?

00:04:08.231 --> 00:04:10.522
Do you know how you want to be remembered?

00:04:10.834 --> 00:04:12.604
Is location important?

00:04:13.005 --> 00:04:15.202
Do you want to be near the ocean

00:04:15.226 --> 00:04:16.752
or in the ocean?

00:04:16.776 --> 00:04:18.769
(Laughter)

00:04:18.793 --> 00:04:22.126
Do you want a religious service
or an informal party,

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:24.619
or do you want to go out with a bang,

00:04:24.643 --> 00:04:26.993
literally, in a firework?

00:04:27.017 --> 00:04:28.731
(Laughter)

00:04:28.755 --> 00:04:31.151
When it comes to death,
there's so much to discuss,

00:04:31.175 --> 00:04:33.412
but I want to focus on two aspects:

00:04:33.436 --> 00:04:39.031
why talking about and planning your death
can help you experience a good death,

00:04:39.055 --> 00:04:41.524
and then reduce the stress
on your loved ones;

00:04:41.548 --> 00:04:44.905
and how talking about death can help us
support those who are grieving.

00:04:45.876 --> 00:04:47.524
So let's start with planning.

00:04:48.241 --> 00:04:50.122
How many of you have a will?

00:04:50.146 --> 00:04:51.296
Put your hand up.

00:04:51.898 --> 00:04:53.972
Oh, this is fantastic.

00:04:53.996 --> 00:04:58.179
In Australia, 45 percent
of adults over the age of 18

00:04:58.203 --> 00:05:00.067
do not have a legal will.

00:05:01.133 --> 00:05:03.807
You're a little bit above average.

00:05:03.831 --> 00:05:06.177
This is a startling statistic

00:05:06.201 --> 00:05:09.815
given that writing a will can actually
be quite simple and inexpensive.

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:12.846
So I started asking
my friends and neighbors

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:16.077
and was really surprised to learn
many of them don't have a will,

00:05:16.101 --> 00:05:19.028
and some couples don't realize
they need individual wills.

00:05:19.627 --> 00:05:23.420
The usual explanation was, well,
it's all going to go to my partner anyway.

00:05:24.667 --> 00:05:26.494
So keep in mind that laws vary

00:05:26.518 --> 00:05:29.335
from state to state
and country to country,

00:05:29.359 --> 00:05:31.517
but this is what happens
in New South Wales

00:05:31.541 --> 00:05:34.017
if you die without leaving a legal will.

00:05:35.621 --> 00:05:38.819
Firstly, a suitable administrator
must be appointed

00:05:38.843 --> 00:05:41.065
by the Supreme Court of New South Wales.

00:05:41.854 --> 00:05:45.028
Chances are this is someone
who would never have met the deceased.

00:05:45.814 --> 00:05:49.225
That person is then responsible
for arranging your funeral,

00:05:49.249 --> 00:05:53.090
collecting assets and distributing them
after paying debts and taxes.

00:05:54.042 --> 00:05:57.026
And one of those debts
will be the bill for their services.

00:05:57.462 --> 00:05:59.367
This is not someone who would have known

00:05:59.391 --> 00:06:02.058
you want the four-foot
wooden giraffe in your living room

00:06:02.082 --> 00:06:05.537
to go to the person who helped you
carry it halfway across the world,

00:06:05.561 --> 00:06:07.874
and yes, that's in my will.

00:06:07.898 --> 00:06:09.799
(Laughter)

00:06:10.251 --> 00:06:12.939
If you die leaving a spouse
or a domestic partner,

00:06:12.963 --> 00:06:15.782
then chances are
they will receive your estate,

00:06:15.806 --> 00:06:18.726
but if you are single,
it's far more complicated,

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:23.306
as parents, siblings, half-siblings
and dependents all come into play.

00:06:24.101 --> 00:06:28.455
And did you know that if you make
a regular donation to charity,

00:06:28.479 --> 00:06:31.394
that charity may have grounds
to make a claim on your estate?

00:06:32.511 --> 00:06:35.784
The most important thing to know
is the bigger your estate,

00:06:35.808 --> 00:06:37.698
the more complicated that will will be,

00:06:37.722 --> 00:06:39.704
and the more expensive that bill.

00:06:40.882 --> 00:06:44.067
So if you don't have a will, I ask you ...

00:06:45.406 --> 00:06:47.402
when else in your life

00:06:47.426 --> 00:06:50.567
have you willingly given money
to the government

00:06:50.591 --> 00:06:52.029
when you didn't have to?

00:06:52.053 --> 00:06:54.267
(Laughter)

00:06:55.682 --> 00:06:59.063
I lost my father in February
to a progressive lung disease.

00:06:59.706 --> 00:07:01.506
When dad knew his death was imminent,

00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:02.944
he had three clear wishes.

00:07:03.698 --> 00:07:06.016
He wanted to die at home;

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:08.569
he wanted to die surrounded by family;

00:07:08.593 --> 00:07:11.674
and he wanted to die peacefully,
not choking or gasping for air.

00:07:13.008 --> 00:07:17.183
And I'm pleased to say that my family
were able to support dad's wishes,

00:07:17.207 --> 00:07:18.814
and he achieved his goals,

00:07:18.838 --> 00:07:21.817
and in that sense, he had a good death.

00:07:22.444 --> 00:07:24.206
He had the death he planned for.

00:07:25.538 --> 00:07:27.237
Because dad wanted to die at home,

00:07:27.261 --> 00:07:29.405
we had to have some
pretty tough conversations

00:07:29.429 --> 00:07:31.133
and fill out a lot of paperwork.

00:07:31.853 --> 00:07:36.138
The questions on the forms cover everything
from resuscitation to organ donation.

00:07:37.282 --> 00:07:40.393
Dad said, "Take whatever
organs you can use."

00:07:41.226 --> 00:07:43.289
This was upsetting to my mum,

00:07:43.313 --> 00:07:45.738
as my dad's health
was deteriorating rapidly,

00:07:45.762 --> 00:07:49.273
and it was no longer the right time
to talk about organ donation.

00:07:50.912 --> 00:07:54.198
I believe we need to discuss these issues
when we are fit and healthy,

00:07:54.222 --> 00:07:56.670
so we can take the emotion out of it,

00:07:56.694 --> 00:07:59.472
and then we can learn
not just what is important,

00:07:59.496 --> 00:08:01.098
but why it's important.

00:08:02.269 --> 00:08:04.729
So as part of my journey,

00:08:04.753 --> 00:08:09.277
I started engaging my family and friends
to find out their thoughts on death,

00:08:09.301 --> 00:08:11.118
and how they wanted to be remembered.

00:08:12.406 --> 00:08:16.739
I discovered you can host
a "Death Over Dinner,"

00:08:16.763 --> 00:08:18.723
or a "Death Cafe,"

00:08:18.747 --> 00:08:21.507
which is a great, casual way
to introduce the topic ...

00:08:21.531 --> 00:08:23.564
(Laughter)

00:08:23.588 --> 00:08:25.342
and gain some wonderful insight.

00:08:25.366 --> 00:08:27.061
(Laughter)

00:08:27.085 --> 00:08:30.744
Did you know that your body
has to be legally disposed of,

00:08:30.768 --> 00:08:33.332
and you can't just be shoved off a cliff

00:08:33.356 --> 00:08:35.046
or set fire to in the backyard?

00:08:35.070 --> 00:08:36.303
(Laughter)

00:08:36.327 --> 00:08:38.204
In Australia, you have three options.

00:08:38.228 --> 00:08:40.475
The two most common
are burial and cremation,

00:08:40.499 --> 00:08:43.538
but you can also donate
your body to science.

00:08:43.562 --> 00:08:46.491
And I am pleased to report
that innovation has touched

00:08:46.515 --> 00:08:48.109
the world of corpse disposal.

00:08:48.133 --> 00:08:49.234
(Laughter)

00:08:49.258 --> 00:08:51.314
You can now opt for an eco-funeral.

00:08:51.338 --> 00:08:53.406
You can be buried at the base of a tree

00:08:53.430 --> 00:08:56.234
in recycled cardboard or a wicker basket,

00:08:56.258 --> 00:08:57.900
and for those who love the ocean,

00:08:57.924 --> 00:09:00.480
there are eco-friendly urns
that will dissolve at sea.

00:09:01.448 --> 00:09:04.179
Personally, I plan to be cremated,

00:09:04.203 --> 00:09:06.717
but given that I get seasick,

00:09:06.741 --> 00:09:08.552
I can think of nothing worse

00:09:08.576 --> 00:09:11.822
than having my ashes
flung into a huge ocean swell.

00:09:12.735 --> 00:09:15.655
I've actually bought a plot
in the rose garden next to my dad.

00:09:16.314 --> 00:09:18.267
I call it my investment property.

00:09:18.291 --> 00:09:20.751
(Laughter)

00:09:20.775 --> 00:09:23.900
But sadly, there's no tax deduction.

00:09:23.924 --> 00:09:26.161
(Laughter)

00:09:26.185 --> 00:09:29.534
So if you plan for your death,

00:09:29.558 --> 00:09:33.654
then your survivors will know
how to experience a healthy bereavement

00:09:33.678 --> 00:09:36.781
without fear or guilt of having failed
to honor your legacy.

00:09:37.866 --> 00:09:40.533
As part of my research,
I've been to seminars,

00:09:40.557 --> 00:09:43.603
read books and talked
to palliative care nurses.

00:09:43.627 --> 00:09:44.958
And I've come to understand

00:09:44.982 --> 00:09:48.301
as a consequence
of not talking about death,

00:09:48.325 --> 00:09:50.452
we don't know how to be around grief.

00:09:51.591 --> 00:09:54.810
And on the flip side,
if we talk about death more,

00:09:54.834 --> 00:09:59.151
we will become more comfortable with
the emotions we experience around grief.

00:10:01.556 --> 00:10:03.327
I discovered, this year,

00:10:03.351 --> 00:10:07.224
it's actually a privilege
to help someone exit this life,

00:10:07.248 --> 00:10:11.111
and although my heart
is heavy with loss and sadness,

00:10:11.135 --> 00:10:12.659
it is not heavy with regret.

00:10:13.524 --> 00:10:15.517
I knew what dad wanted,

00:10:15.541 --> 00:10:18.413
and I feel at peace knowing
I could support his wishes.

00:10:21.057 --> 00:10:24.698
My dad's last 24 hours
were in a peaceful coma,

00:10:24.722 --> 00:10:26.730
and after days of around-the-clock care,

00:10:26.754 --> 00:10:29.167
we had time to sit, hold his hand,

00:10:29.191 --> 00:10:30.475
and say goodbye.

00:10:31.494 --> 00:10:34.883
He passed away on a Monday morning
just before breakfast,

00:10:34.907 --> 00:10:36.574
and after the doctor came

00:10:36.598 --> 00:10:39.214
and we waited for the funeral home,

00:10:39.238 --> 00:10:42.984
I went into the kitchen,
and I ate a big bowl of porridge.

00:10:45.041 --> 00:10:48.136
When I told some of my friends this,
they were really shocked.

00:10:48.947 --> 00:10:51.985
"How could you eat at a time like that?"

00:10:53.164 --> 00:10:56.073
Well, I was hungry.

00:10:56.097 --> 00:11:00.787
(Laughter)

00:11:00.811 --> 00:11:04.764
You see, grief impacted my sleep
and my ability to concentrate,

00:11:04.788 --> 00:11:08.039
but it never impacted my stomach.
I was always hungry.

00:11:08.063 --> 00:11:09.247
(Laughter)

00:11:09.271 --> 00:11:10.881
It's different for all of us,

00:11:10.905 --> 00:11:13.626
and it's really important
that we acknowledge that.

00:11:14.698 --> 00:11:17.849
So if we don't talk about our death
and the death of loved ones,

00:11:17.873 --> 00:11:22.004
how can we possibly support
a friend, a colleague, a neighbor

00:11:22.028 --> 00:11:23.645
who is grieving?

00:11:23.669 --> 00:11:26.678
How do we support someone
who has lost someone suddenly,

00:11:26.702 --> 00:11:28.605
like an accident or suicide?

00:11:29.685 --> 00:11:31.145
We tend to avoid them ...

00:11:32.359 --> 00:11:34.820
not because we don't care,

00:11:34.844 --> 00:11:36.716
because we don't know what to say.

00:11:37.912 --> 00:11:40.564
We know as a friend we can't fix it,

00:11:40.588 --> 00:11:43.183
we can't take away that pain,

00:11:43.207 --> 00:11:46.398
so we say things
to fill that awkward silence,

00:11:46.422 --> 00:11:48.119
sometimes things we regret saying.

00:11:49.532 --> 00:11:50.817
Examples would be:

00:11:53.158 --> 00:11:55.174
"At least he isn't suffering anymore."

00:11:56.673 --> 00:11:58.418
"At least you've got your memories."

00:12:00.215 --> 00:12:03.135
"At least you don't have to pay
for hospital parking anymore."

00:12:03.159 --> 00:12:05.255
(Laughter)

00:12:05.279 --> 00:12:08.040
Really, we don't need to say anything.

00:12:08.588 --> 00:12:10.048
We just need to be.

00:12:11.211 --> 00:12:13.055
Be patient,

00:12:13.079 --> 00:12:15.261
be understanding,

00:12:15.285 --> 00:12:16.512
and be a listener.

00:12:17.672 --> 00:12:20.906
And if you can't be any of those things,

00:12:20.930 --> 00:12:25.141
then please, be the person who makes
the lasagna, the curry or the casserole,

00:12:25.165 --> 00:12:27.625
because your offerings
will be greatly appreciated.

00:12:27.649 --> 00:12:29.212
(Laughter)

00:12:29.686 --> 00:12:32.028
I've been to 10 funerals in the last year,

00:12:32.052 --> 00:12:34.022
one of which I helped arrange.

00:12:34.046 --> 00:12:36.264
They ran the full gamut:

00:12:36.288 --> 00:12:38.749
a very solemn Greek Orthodox service,

00:12:38.773 --> 00:12:41.384
four Catholic requiem masses

00:12:41.408 --> 00:12:43.067
and a garden party

00:12:43.091 --> 00:12:47.528
where I made a toast while scattering
my friend's ashes around her garden

00:12:47.552 --> 00:12:48.877
with a soup ladle.

00:12:48.901 --> 00:12:50.427
(Laughter)

00:12:50.451 --> 00:12:55.085
I have carried, kissed, written on
and toasted coffins with a shot of ouzo.

00:12:55.783 --> 00:12:57.359
I have worn all black,

00:12:57.383 --> 00:13:00.160
all color and a party dress.

00:13:00.184 --> 00:13:02.469
Despite the vast differences in sendoff,

00:13:02.493 --> 00:13:05.015
despite me being at times
out of my comfort zone

00:13:05.039 --> 00:13:07.881
doing something I've never done before,

00:13:07.905 --> 00:13:09.865
I drew comfort from one thing --

00:13:10.889 --> 00:13:13.873
knowing that this is what each person
would have wanted.

00:13:15.187 --> 00:13:16.337
So what do I want?

00:13:17.218 --> 00:13:21.210
Well, I like to be organized,
so I have the will,

00:13:21.234 --> 00:13:24.424
I'm a registered organ donor,
and I have my investment property.

00:13:25.186 --> 00:13:27.917
All that is left is planning my sendoff,

00:13:27.941 --> 00:13:31.282
a big party, lots of champagne,

00:13:31.306 --> 00:13:35.020
color, laughter, and of course,
music to remember me by.

00:13:35.496 --> 00:13:36.647
Thank you.

00:13:36.671 --> 00:13:43.671
(Applause)
