00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:06.660
So we have 14x plus 4
over negative 3x minus 2

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.060
is equal to 8.

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:10.680
And I'll give you a
few moments to see

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:14.510
if you can tackle
it on your own.

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:16.180
So this equation
right here, at first

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:18.600
it doesn't look like a
straightforward linear

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:19.220
equation.

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:22.720
We have one expression on
top of another expression.

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:24.720
But as we'll see,
we can simplify

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.740
this to turn it into
a linear equation.

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:29.250
So the first thing
that I want to do

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.479
is, I don't like this negative
3x plus 2 sitting here

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:35.320
in the denominator,
it makes me stressed.

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:39.140
So I want to multiply both
sides of this equation

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:42.760
times negative 3x minus 2.

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:48.170
What does that do for us?

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:51.140
Well, on the left-hand side, you
have this negative 3x minus 2,

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:53.370
it's going to be over
negative 3x minus 2,

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.600
they will cancel out.

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.460
And so you're left with,
on the left-hand side,

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:03.200
your 14x plus 4.

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.190
And on your right-hand
side, you just

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:08.090
have to multiply 8 times
negative 3x minus 2.

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.560
So you are left with--
well, 8 times negative 3x

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:18.460
is negative 24x, and
then 8 times negative 2

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:21.154
is negative 16.

00:01:21.154 --> 00:01:22.070
And there you have it.

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:25.590
We have simplified this to just
a traditional linear equation.

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.330
We've got variables
on both sides,

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.577
so we can just keep simplifying.

00:01:29.577 --> 00:01:31.160
So the first thing
I want to do, let's

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:32.909
just say we want to
put all of our x terms

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.330
on the left-hand side.

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:39.469
So I want to get rid of this
negative 24x right over here.

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:41.010
So the best way to
do that, I'm going

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:43.630
to add 24x to the
right-hand side.

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:45.380
I can't just do it to
the right-hand side,

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:48.320
I have to also do it
to the left-hand side.

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:52.130
And so I am left with,
on the left-hand side,

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:56.220
14x plus 24x is 38x.

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:00.130
And then I have the plus
4-- Is equal to, well,

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:02.590
negative 24x plus 24x.

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:05.335
Those cancel each
other out, and we

00:02:05.335 --> 00:02:07.330
are left with just
the negative 16.

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:12.900
Now we just have to
get rid of this 4 here.

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.880
Let's subtract that
4 from both sides.

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.010
And we are left with-- and
this is the home stretch now--

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:27.570
we are left with 38x is
equal to negative 16 minus 4

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:29.860
is negative 20.

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:33.373
And so we can divide both
sides of this equation by 38.

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:40.420
And we are left with x
is equal to negative 20

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:43.320
over 38, which can be
simplified further.

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:46.220
Both the numerator the
denominator is divisible by 2.

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:48.360
So let's divide the numerator
and denominator by 2,

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:52.490
and we get negative 10 over 19.

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:57.670
x is equal to negative 10
over 19, and we are done.

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:00.200
I encourage you to
validate this for yourself.

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.570
It's a little bit of a hairy
number right over here,

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:04.570
but to take this number,
substitute it back

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:07.510
into our original equation,
and validate that it actually

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:10.390
does satisfy that equation.
