00:00:00.337 --> 00:00:01.811
- People say everybody believes

00:00:01.811 --> 00:00:03.820
that these students are
going to be the future.

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:05.063
- Yep.
- And yet,

00:00:05.063 --> 00:00:06.816
we have a dropout rate that's ridiculous,

00:00:06.816 --> 00:00:08.316
we have kids who go to college

00:00:08.316 --> 00:00:10.571
and they need remedial
courses in English and Math,

00:00:10.571 --> 00:00:12.364
they're dropping out of college.

00:00:12.364 --> 00:00:14.947
So, how do you get past saying,

00:00:15.804 --> 00:00:18.155
I believe that you're
going to be the future

00:00:18.155 --> 00:00:20.123
and actually making it come true?

00:00:20.123 --> 00:00:23.259
- I actually will push back and say,

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:25.377
I don't know if everybody
truly believes that.

00:00:25.377 --> 00:00:26.498
- Okay, maybe that's why.

00:00:26.498 --> 00:00:28.639
- If we truly all believed that,

00:00:28.639 --> 00:00:31.117
then why would we have to deal with some

00:00:31.117 --> 00:00:33.582
of the systemic issues around bias

00:00:33.582 --> 00:00:35.255
and the individual issues around bias

00:00:35.255 --> 00:00:37.619
that we know our young people confront

00:00:37.619 --> 00:00:39.132
each and every single day.

00:00:39.132 --> 00:00:42.896
There is systemic issues
that need to be dealt with,

00:00:42.896 --> 00:00:46.146
and if we truly hold every single child

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:50.173
has that expectation,
we hold the expectation

00:00:50.173 --> 00:00:52.185
for them to be college,
career, and life ready,

00:00:52.185 --> 00:00:54.034
we need to make sure our young people

00:00:54.034 --> 00:00:55.928
actually get those opportunities.

00:00:55.928 --> 00:01:00.267
This is about opportunity
gaps that we must close.

00:01:00.267 --> 00:01:03.291
Too many of our young people
have been marginalized.

00:01:03.291 --> 00:01:04.708
Especially our young people of color.

00:01:04.708 --> 00:01:06.624
And we've gotta give
them those opportunities

00:01:06.624 --> 00:01:07.613
to actually be successful.
