00:00:04.567 --> 00:00:06.533
Albert Einstein
lived through, and was,

00:00:06.533 --> 00:00:08.600
in fact, a central
figure, in some

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:12.066
of the most important
moments of the first half

00:00:12.066 --> 00:00:13.633
of the 20th century.

00:00:13.633 --> 00:00:17.000
You know the world was
in a real state of chaos.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.300
Things were shifting hugely.

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:20.934
Huge plates were shifting.

00:00:20.934 --> 00:00:26.400
The big part of our story
is about a Jewish man who is

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.066
living in Europe in a time of
extraordinary anti-Semitism

00:00:30.066 --> 00:00:31.967
and the rise of fascism.

00:00:31.967 --> 00:00:33.900
And a big part of our story is--

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:35.834
is he going to stay in Germany?

00:00:35.834 --> 00:00:37.033
Is he going to leave?

00:00:37.033 --> 00:00:39.033
And it becomes an
immigration story.

00:00:39.033 --> 00:00:40.033
No.

00:00:40.033 --> 00:00:41.433
I will not kowtow to police.

00:00:41.433 --> 00:00:43.734
And I will not sit by
and wait for fascists

00:00:43.734 --> 00:00:44.967
to kill my husband.

00:00:44.967 --> 00:00:48.233
He took an awful lot of
persuading to leave Germany.

00:00:48.233 --> 00:00:49.800
I want to leave, Albert.

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.200
Please!

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:55.500
Had Elsa and his family
have not taken the steps,

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:56.533
he'd have been lost to us.

00:00:56.533 --> 00:00:58.500
He would had been exterminated.

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.066
On a personal level,
this is a fascinating story

00:01:01.066 --> 00:01:05.533
about somebody doing all of that
amazing stuff, which isn't even

00:01:05.533 --> 00:01:07.133
at the forefront of this story.

00:01:07.133 --> 00:01:09.633
The forefront of this story are
these personal relationships,

00:01:09.633 --> 00:01:11.500
and the drama that
he suffered along

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:15.133
the way whilst trying to
achieve these amazing things

00:01:15.133 --> 00:01:16.433
for humanity.

00:01:16.433 --> 00:01:18.467
He wanted to give these
things to the world,

00:01:18.467 --> 00:01:21.133
and interpret things as
his reason for being,

00:01:21.133 --> 00:01:22.400
as his reason for existing.

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.333
And he faced huge
adversity in doing so.

00:01:25.333 --> 00:01:27.500
These tragedies
and relationships

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.600
that disintegrated, and
governments that didn't support

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.266
him or ostracized
him as a Jew, that

00:01:34.266 --> 00:01:35.800
forced him out of the country.

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:41.266
Take an individual who is
struggling, complete underdog.

00:01:41.266 --> 00:01:43.533
Come back when you wish
to be taken seriously!

00:01:43.533 --> 00:01:45.033
You know, he was brilliant.

00:01:45.033 --> 00:01:49.367
But he struggled within the
world of formal academia.

00:01:49.367 --> 00:01:51.200
They didn't really know
what to make of him.

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.333
He was working in
a patent office

00:01:53.333 --> 00:01:54.700
when he was making
his breakthroughs,

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:57.066
because he couldn't even
get a teaching position.

00:01:57.066 --> 00:02:02.100
However, it's all heightened
because Albert Einstein was

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.667
Jewish at a time
when his religion was

00:02:04.667 --> 00:02:09.500
a tremendous liability,
if not a physical threat.

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.000
This is what he lived through.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.367
And he faced it.
