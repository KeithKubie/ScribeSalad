the blood typing game is an educational
 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:13.869
the blood typing game is an educational
game that teaches students about the

00:00:13.869 --> 00:00:13.879
game that teaches students about the
 

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:16.060
game that teaches students about the
human blood types by administering

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:16.070
human blood types by administering
 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:19.679
human blood types by administering
virtual blood transfusions to patients

00:00:19.679 --> 00:00:19.689
virtual blood transfusions to patients
 

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:22.600
virtual blood transfusions to patients
when you receive your patient you need

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:22.610
when you receive your patient you need
 

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:24.250
when you receive your patient you need
to discover their blood type before

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:24.260
to discover their blood type before
 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:27.339
to discover their blood type before
performing the transfusion first use the

00:00:27.339 --> 00:00:27.349
performing the transfusion first use the
 

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:29.560
performing the transfusion first use the
syringe to draw your patient's blood and

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:29.570
syringe to draw your patient's blood and
 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:32.799
syringe to draw your patient's blood and
deposit it into three test tubes the

00:00:32.799 --> 00:00:32.809
deposit it into three test tubes the
 

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:34.720
deposit it into three test tubes the
test tubes contain three different

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:34.730
test tubes contain three different
 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:37.840
test tubes contain three different
reagents with either a B or RH

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:37.850
reagents with either a B or RH
 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:40.750
reagents with either a B or RH
antibodies the antibodies attached to

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:40.760
antibodies the antibodies attached to
 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:42.700
antibodies the antibodies attached to
antigens on the patient's red blood

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:42.710
antigens on the patient's red blood
 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:46.240
antigens on the patient's red blood
cells if they match no agglutination in

cells if they match no agglutination in
 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:48.579
cells if they match no agglutination in
test tube a indicates that the patient

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:48.589
test tube a indicates that the patient
 

00:00:48.589 --> 00:00:50.670
test tube a indicates that the patient
does not belong to blood group a

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:50.680
does not belong to blood group a
 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.530
does not belong to blood group a
agglutination in test tube B indicates

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:53.540
agglutination in test tube B indicates
 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:56.049
agglutination in test tube B indicates
the patient does belong to blood group B

00:00:56.049 --> 00:00:56.059
the patient does belong to blood group B
 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:00:59.619
the patient does belong to blood group B
in test tube Rh the blood is Rh positive

00:00:59.619 --> 00:00:59.629
in test tube Rh the blood is Rh positive
 

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:03.250
in test tube Rh the blood is Rh positive
if there is clumping and Rh negative

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:03.260
if there is clumping and Rh negative
 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:07.240
if there is clumping and Rh negative
if there is no clumping we know that

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:07.250
if there is no clumping we know that
 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:09.399
if there is no clumping we know that
this patient's blood type is b-positive

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:09.409
this patient's blood type is b-positive
 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:11.620
this patient's blood type is b-positive
because clumping occurred in the test

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:11.630
