00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:02.960
If you were to design a version control system specifically for

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:04.490
code, what would it look like?

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:05.300
In the rest of this lesson,

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:08.660
we'll be discussing many ways version control systems can be different and

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:11.030
what a programmer would want in each case.

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:13.980
Wikipedia and Google Docs are clearly not designed for writing code.

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.110
They require you to use their special purpose editors that don't have any

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:19.600
features that programmers tend to want in an editor,

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:22.310
like syntax highlighting and parenthesis matching.

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:26.300
Using Dropbox is a more plausible alternative here since you can use any editor

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.640
you want and the files are saved on your computer, as well as in the cloud.

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.500
Similarly, when you save copies manually,

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.770
you can edit with whatever program you prefer.

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:36.870
Wikipedia also doesn't actually save files on your computer,

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.185
which would make it hard to run your code.

00:00:38.185 --> 00:00:42.325
Google Drive does let you save your Google Docs files on your own computer, but

00:00:42.325 --> 00:00:46.010
they're in a special format that only works with their special purpose editor

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:48.250
and you can't access the history offline.

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:49.460
Dropbox is similar.

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:51.590
Again, you can edit your files on your own computer, but

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:53.360
you can only see the history online.

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.100
Manual saving is the only option here that you can use offline.

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.200
Of course syntax highlighting and offline access to history aren't the only

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:02.350
areas where programmers would want different features in their version control.

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:05.730
The next feature I want to consider is whether users should manually choose when

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:09.160
to save or whether the systems should save versions automatically.

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:12.100
Let's think about which option would be better for code.

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:16.070
As a programmer, when would you want to have versions of your code saved?

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:18.460
Consider a few different use case scenarios when you're coming up

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:19.700
with your answer.

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:23.970
One option would be at regular intervals, maybe every hour.

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.750
Or maybe whenever there's a big enough change, maybe 50 lines or so.

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.850
Or maybe when there's a long pause in editing.

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:32.920
Or lastly, when you choose to save a version.
