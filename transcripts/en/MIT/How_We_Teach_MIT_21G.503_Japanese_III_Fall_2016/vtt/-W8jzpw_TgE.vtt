TAKAIKO AIKAWA: So on campus,
besides our language classes,

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:14.130
our students have
some opportunities

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.340
to interact with native
Japanese speakers,

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.800
or so we have lots of events.

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.790
One major event is lunch table.

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:28.560
That is actually sponsored
by MIT Japan, which actually

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.910
is a program that sends
a lot of our students

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.540
to Japan as internship.

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.350
So together with
MIT Japan program,

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.550
we host a Japanese
lunch table once a week,

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.390
so that students go to
lunch table and then

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.530
the native speakers of Japanese,
especially the Japanese Wives

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.240
Club at MIT, they really
support this activity.

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:02.100
We also have a
Japan at MIT event.

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.810
This event is also in
collaboration with MIT Japan.

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.800
And at the beginning
of each semester,

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:14.730
we kind of have a big
party, together with sushi,

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:19.050
and then we introduce
language program.

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:22.920
At the same time, we introduce
a lot of Japan-related culture

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.690
courses.

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:27.270
And then we invite
Japanese Wives

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.780
Club so that students
can be exposed

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.670
to cultural activities,
such as tea ceremony

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.204
or how to wear kimono,
those kind of things.
