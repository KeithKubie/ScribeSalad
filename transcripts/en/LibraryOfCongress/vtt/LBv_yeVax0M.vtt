00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.130
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:07.730
&gt;&gt; Fred Augustyn: It
is my pleasant task

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:11.780
to introduce Callista Gingrich
the author of several books,

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:15.680
four so far on Ellis the
Elephant featuring him.

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:19.640
In any case including
"Sweet Land of Liberty"

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:22.770
about American exceptionalism,
"Land of the Pilgrim's Pride"

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:26.360
about colonial America both were on
the New York Times Best Seller list

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:27.980
of children's picture books.

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:30.140
"Yankee Doodle Dandy" is
about the American Revolution,

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:34.940
"From Sea to Shining Sea" is about
the expedition of Lewis and Clark

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:37.670
and the early years
of the United States.

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:40.080
"Christmas in America" is about
the history of that holiday

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:44.440
and was released in October, 2015.

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.750
There is a pattern here.

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:50.360
Callista if I may so address
her is very much interested

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.090
in American history and the
cause of freedom in the world

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:58.040
and that accounts for many of
her, much of her work on history

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:59.740
and public policy documentaries.

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:04.130
She's multi-talented
and a multi-tasker.

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:08.140
Long interest in music which was
her major in college Callista sings

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:10.620
in the choir at the Basilica
of the National Shrine

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:12.220
of the Immaculate Conception
in Washington,

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:15.360
D.C. Many people probably know.

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.100
It's right near the Catholic
University of America.

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:23.620
Originally from Wisconsin she is of
Polish descent on her father's side

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:27.100
and the Polish connection led to
my meeting her several years ago

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.640
which I remember very
fondly, four years ago.

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:35.410 position:56%
She was at a bipartisan event to get
out the vote among Polish Americans

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:38.080
and the President of
that organization,

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:42.540 position:56%
the American Polish Advisory Council
is retired General Edward Roney then

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:49.520
95 years old but still with us
thankfully and she and her husband,

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:55.120
Newt Gingrich who is a writer in
his own right talked about one

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:59.970
of their trips to Poland and they
did a documentary on the first trip

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:04.500
to Poland by the Pope
John Paul II in 1979.

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.150
And at that time I said to
myself what a nice person she is.

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:12.990
And somebody who generally enjoys
talking to and looking about people

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:16.540
and I'm sure that you will agree
with me so it is my privilege

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.850 position:56%
to introduce author, musician and
documentarian Callista Gingrich here

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:23.940
to talk about her role as a
writer of children's books.

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:25.240
[Applause]

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:27.370
&gt;&gt; Callista Gingrich: Thank you.

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:29.960
Thank you so much.

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:32.260
Come on over Ellis.

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:35.600
Well, good morning.

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.440
It's wonderful to be
here with you today.

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.780
My name is Callista Gingrich

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:46.090
and this is my very special
friend Ellis the Elephant.

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:56.220
Ellis is a very smart
and very fun elephant.

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:00.090
He loves to read books,
don't you Ellis?

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:02.340
And I know that many of
you love to read books

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:07.260
as well that's why we're all here
at the National Book Festival.

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:11.670
Now, Ellis loves to read
about American history

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:15.150
and has had many, many adventures.

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:18.980
In my first book "Sweet Land
of Liberty" Ellis learns

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:22.560
about what makes America special.

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:25.090
In "Land of the Pilgrims
Pride" he learns

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:28.940
about the pilgrims
and colonial America.

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:33.060
In "Yankee Doodle Dandy" Ellis
learns about our patriots

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.990
and the American Revolution.

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:40.640
In "From Sea to Shining Sea" he
learns about the Wild, Wild West

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:44.110
and the great expedition
of Lewis and Clark.

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:47.000
And in "Christmas in
America" Ellis learns

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.930
about how Christmas has been
celebrated throughout our

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:51.990
nation's history.

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:54.870
Do any of you like Christmas?

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:59.480
Yes, well and snow too.

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:00.780
Excellent.

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:03.280
Well Ellis likes Christmas too.

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:06.610
Well today we are going
to join Ellis as he learns

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:10.130
about something very,
very important.

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:13.590
In my new book "Hail to
the Chief" Ellis learns

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:15.920
about our American presidents

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:20.930 position:56%
and discovers how they've led our
country throughout American history.

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:25.980 position:56%
Now, who knows who our president is?

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:28.010
Who is our president?

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:30.140
Anybody know?

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:33.180
Our president is President
Obama of course

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:36.610
and where does our president live?

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:37.910
Anybody.

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:39.210
&gt;&gt; In the White House.

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:41.180
&gt;&gt; The White House exactly.

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:45.520
And who was our very
first president?

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:46.820
&gt;&gt; Washington.

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:48.130
&gt;&gt; Yes. It was George Washington.

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:50.080
That is exactly right.

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:54.790
Now in "Hail to the Chief" Ellis
is going to learn about some

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:59.830
of our most important and
influential presidents and I am

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:03.490
so excited to share this
book with you today.

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:09.530
But first I want to talk about why
it's so important for you to learn

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:12.340
about our American
presidents with Ellis.

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:17.020
Now in a just a few weeks
our country will vote

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:20.280
for our 45th president.

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:26.240 position:56%
This is a very big decision and it's
going to impact our entire nation

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:32.870
and someday all of you kids are
going to be able to vote as well.

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:38.720 position:56%
Now to vote you'll have to
understand what the presidency means

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:41.920
and what better way to do so
than by learning about some

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:44.470
of our greatest presidents.

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:49.080
This is what you can do
with Ellis the Elephant.

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:52.030
In "Hail to the Chief" you'll
learn that the President

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:56.500
of the United States is one of
the most important elected leaders

00:05:56.500 --> 00:06:02.780
in the world and that he or she
represents our entire nation.

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:04.790
You'll learn that many
different kinds

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:09.600
of people have become president
each with their unique strengths,

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:13.030
perspectives and weaknesses.

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:16.230
And finally you'll
learn that any American

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:20.190
from any background can
grow up to become President

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:24.910
of the United States and have
the chance to change history.

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:31.820
Now we have never had an
elephant as president before.

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:35.820 position:56%
And Ellis I don't think we ever will

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:38.700
so unfortunately President
Ellis might be

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:43.170
out of the question
but you know what?

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:46.390
Anyone of you could grow
up to be the President

00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:50.000
of the United States just like the
presidents in this book have done.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.960
Isn't that right Ellis?

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:56.540
This is the first time
I've ever read this book

00:06:56.540 --> 00:07:04.380
to anyone including Ellis so,
let's read "Hail to the Chief"

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:07.320
and I hope you'll enjoy it.

00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:10.410
And if some of you children
want to come up a little closer

00:07:10.410 --> 00:07:14.950
so you can see the pictures in
the book that would be great.

00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:17.810
Come on up.

00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:19.110
Come on up.

00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:21.640
There's lots of room for everybody.

00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:42.400
Let's switch places Ellis.

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:44.700
Yeah. All right.

00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:47.140
It's great to see so
many of you here today.

00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:49.480
Wow what a great looking group.

00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:51.780
Isn't it Ellis?

00:07:56.510 --> 00:07:58.190
Yes. All right.

00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:04.380
All right it looks like
we're all ready to go and I'm

00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:06.900
so happy to see all of you here.

00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:12.440
So the book is called "Hail to
the Chief" and you can see Ellis

00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:26.060
on the cover with some of our other
presidents and the dedication says,

00:08:26.060 --> 00:08:28.930
"Dedicated to our American
presidents

00:08:28.930 --> 00:08:34.460
who have led this exceptional
nation.

00:08:39.420 --> 00:08:43.120
"The American president
has a great task,

00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:47.330
a job as exciting as
anyone could ask.

00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:50.970
Elected to uphold America's
laws the Commander

00:08:50.970 --> 00:08:55.090
in Chief defends freedom's cause.

00:08:55.090 --> 00:08:59.810 position:56%
Ellis the elephant knew our country
was blessed with exceptional leaders

00:08:59.810 --> 00:09:01.830
who stood up to the test.

00:09:01.830 --> 00:09:05.360
He was eager to meet the
presidents of the past

00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:11.310
and learn how they
governed a nation so vast."

00:09:11.310 --> 00:09:15.350
Ellis is in the portrait gallery
in this illustration with some

00:09:15.350 --> 00:09:18.840
of our very first presidents.

00:09:23.350 --> 00:09:27.610
"Ellis had heard of George
Washington before the man

00:09:27.610 --> 00:09:30.790
who led the Revolutionary War.

00:09:30.790 --> 00:09:34.410
After the war it was
General Washington's fate

00:09:34.410 --> 00:09:38.000
to lead the new nation
he fought to create.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.660
As president, Washington was ready

00:09:40.660 --> 00:09:46.180
to serve defending the
freedoms he pledged to preserve.

00:09:46.180 --> 00:09:49.860
Our country's first leader
set the standard indeed

00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:53.740
for future presidents who
would follow his lead.

00:09:53.740 --> 00:09:55.090
Here's George Washington

00:09:55.090 --> 00:10:00.350
at his inauguration our
very first president."

00:10:00.350 --> 00:10:06.670
That was an exciting moment Ellis.

00:10:06.670 --> 00:10:12.300
"Thomas Jefferson was a
Founding Father of our nation.

00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:16.280
He wrote of independence
in a famous declaration.

00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:21.780 position:56%
With clarity and passion this
document explained how our God-given

00:10:21.780 --> 00:10:25.440
rights must always be maintained.

00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:29.260
As president, Jefferson
had a grand vision

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:32.410
and boldly made an
important decision.

00:10:32.410 --> 00:10:35.620
His Louisiana Purchase
added new land

00:10:35.620 --> 00:10:40.020
and opened the West
for America to expand."

00:10:40.020 --> 00:10:47.470
And here is Ellis with
Lewis and Clark and they're

00:10:47.470 --> 00:10:54.150
with President Jefferson and where
does President Jefferson live?

00:10:54.150 --> 00:10:56.120
Monticello.

00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:58.120
Not any more.

00:10:58.120 --> 00:11:01.190
He used to.

00:11:01.190 --> 00:11:02.740
"Known as the father

00:11:02.740 --> 00:11:07.520
of the Constitution James Madison
drafted a brilliant solution.

00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:11.310
As president, Madison
had challenges galore

00:11:11.310 --> 00:11:14.150
when a British invasion
took our country to war.

00:11:14.150 --> 00:11:20.430 position:56%
At the Battle of Baltimore Ellis had
no doubt we'd win the War of 1812

00:11:20.430 --> 00:11:22.600
and kick the British out.

00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:26.960
Here the Star Spangled Banner
waved high for all to see

00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:31.840
and inspired our anthem
by Francis Scott Key."

00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:36.870
Do some of you know the
Star Spangled Banner?

00:11:36.870 --> 00:11:38.170
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:11:38.170 --> 00:11:43.600
&gt;&gt; Callista Gingrich:
Yeah that's great.

00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:47.320
"Andrew Jackson captured
the public's admiration.

00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:51.550
A man of the people with a
strong reputation he vowed

00:11:51.550 --> 00:11:57.930 position:56%
to remember his own humble start and
took every American's need to heart.

00:11:57.930 --> 00:12:01.360
But Jackson learned the
challenge of fame and success

00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:06.400
when his inaugural party
became a real mess.

00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:08.960
Thousands crowded the
White House and made

00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:14.220
such a clamor a major departure
from its usual glamor."

00:12:14.220 --> 00:12:17.840
Look at the White House
and how crazy things got

00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:21.440 position:56%
at Andrew Jackson's inaugural party.

00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:26.080
There's even an eagle swinging
from the chandelier and I've got

00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:27.590
to share something with you.

00:12:27.590 --> 00:12:31.700
In all of these illustrations
there's an eagle and so

00:12:31.700 --> 00:12:34.490
when you're reading these
books you'll always want

00:12:34.490 --> 00:12:35.790
to look for the eagle.

00:12:35.790 --> 00:12:40.050 position:56%
And the eagle represents our freedom
and independence that we have

00:12:40.050 --> 00:12:42.080
in this beautiful country.

00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:48.350
So we'll always look for the eagle.

00:12:48.350 --> 00:12:52.810
"Abraham Lincoln bravely and
wisely presided over a nation

00:12:52.810 --> 00:12:55.660
in crisis and deeply divided.

00:12:55.660 --> 00:12:59.110
A fight over slavery
caused the country to split

00:12:59.110 --> 00:13:03.630
and the Civil War started
when the south tried to quit.

00:13:03.630 --> 00:13:06.970
The conflict was awful
and took a great toll

00:13:06.970 --> 00:13:10.240
so at Gettysburg wrote
and rose to console.

00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:13.520
The Union army fought
long and hard to ensure

00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:18.270
that this fragile young
nation could long endure."

00:13:18.270 --> 00:13:21.280
There's President Lincoln
at Gettysburg.

00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:23.210
&gt;&gt; I see the eagle.

00:13:23.210 --> 00:13:25.610
&gt;&gt; Callista Gingrich:
Do you see the eagle?

00:13:25.610 --> 00:13:28.770
Yes. There he is with
President Lincoln.

00:13:28.770 --> 00:13:31.440
Do you see the eagle?

00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:32.740
&gt;&gt; I see it.

00:13:32.740 --> 00:13:35.830
&gt;&gt; Callista Gingrich:
You see the eagle too.

00:13:35.830 --> 00:13:38.540
That's right.

00:13:38.540 --> 00:13:42.990
"America was filled with many
beautiful places with mountains

00:13:42.990 --> 00:13:46.390
and valleys and wide open spaces.

00:13:46.390 --> 00:13:50.580
President Teddy Roosevelt
cherished conservation and wanted

00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:53.790
to preserve the best
land for the nation.

00:13:53.790 --> 00:13:57.410
Roosevelt set aside
millions of acres of land

00:13:57.410 --> 00:14:00.770
and traveled the country
to see them firsthand.

00:14:00.770 --> 00:14:04.360
On one camping trip he
couldn't help but remark,

00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:06.990
on the beauty of Yosemite
National Park."

00:14:06.990 --> 00:14:08.970
&gt;&gt; I see the eagle again.

00:14:08.970 --> 00:14:10.270
&gt;&gt; Callista Gingrich:
There's Teddy Roosevelt

00:14:10.270 --> 00:14:13.410
and there's the eagle with Teddy.

00:14:13.410 --> 00:14:16.480
Have any of you been
to a national park?

00:14:17.690 --> 00:14:19.790
Probably so.

00:14:19.790 --> 00:14:22.400
Ellis have you been
to a national park?

00:14:25.110 --> 00:14:26.410
All right.

00:14:26.410 --> 00:14:30.680
"As President Woodrow Wilson
decided to send U.S. soldiers

00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:33.340
to bring World War I to an end,

00:14:33.340 --> 00:14:36.670
when all sides agreed the
fighting would cease he sought

00:14:36.670 --> 00:14:39.870
to ensure a long-lasting peace.

00:14:39.870 --> 00:14:43.020
Ellis learned that Wilson
advanced a greater cause

00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:46.720
that all nations would agree
to the same set of laws.

00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:51.860
In Paris he argued for a new
organization an international body

00:14:51.860 --> 00:14:54.590
called the League of Nations."

00:14:54.590 --> 00:14:55.890
&gt;&gt; I see the eagle.

00:14:55.890 --> 00:14:57.900
&gt;&gt; Callista Gingrich: There's
the eagle and there's Ellis

00:14:57.900 --> 00:15:02.030
with President Wilson in Paris.

00:15:02.030 --> 00:15:07.350
Does anybody recognize
the Eiffel Tower in Paris?

00:15:11.310 --> 00:15:17.420
Yes. It is, it is and our President
Woodrow Wilson went to France

00:15:17.420 --> 00:15:28.050
to Paris to work on this particular
body called the League of Nations.

00:15:28.050 --> 00:15:31.150
"Before long World
War II suddenly began

00:15:31.150 --> 00:15:34.890
and Franklin D. Roosevelt
was just the right man.

00:15:34.890 --> 00:15:38.990
He spoke out so the American
people could hear that through war

00:15:38.990 --> 00:15:42.560
and hardship they had
nothing to fear.

00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:46.080
Through fireside chats he
shared America's plight

00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:49.640
and gave people the courage
to continue to fight.

00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:51.960
Month by month Allied Forces pushed

00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:57.530
on to Berlin certain this was the
struggle they'd eventually win."

00:15:57.530 --> 00:15:58.830
&gt;&gt; I see the eagle.

00:15:58.830 --> 00:16:00.450
&gt;&gt; Callista Gingrich: And here's
the eagle and here Ellis is

00:16:00.450 --> 00:16:02.680
with FDR, President Roosevelt.

00:16:02.680 --> 00:16:07.950
He was our President during World
War II and he has his dog with him.

00:16:07.950 --> 00:16:11.450
His dog was named Fala
and there's Fala and Ellis

00:16:11.450 --> 00:16:12.950
with President Roosevelt.

00:16:12.950 --> 00:16:14.850
Do you see the dog?

00:16:14.850 --> 00:16:19.620
That was a cute dog.

00:16:21.180 --> 00:16:24.920
"At long last the Second
World War was won

00:16:24.920 --> 00:16:27.620
but America's job was not yet done.

00:16:27.620 --> 00:16:30.170
Communism threatened
freedom once more

00:16:30.170 --> 00:16:34.940
and this Ellis learned
was called the Cold War.

00:16:34.940 --> 00:16:38.200
President Harry Truman
proposed an alliance

00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:42.120
to unite the free nations
in strong defiance.

00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:45.900
NATO agreement left many
impressed with the strength

00:16:45.900 --> 00:16:49.320
and resolve of the unified west."

00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:50.620
&gt;&gt; I see the eagle.

00:16:50.620 --> 00:16:51.920
&gt;&gt; Callista Gingrich:
You see the eagle

00:16:51.920 --> 00:17:00.190
and there Ellis is
with President Truman.

00:17:02.390 --> 00:17:06.880
"General Dwight Eisenhower best
known as Ike was a president

00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:09.430
that most Americans liked.

00:17:09.430 --> 00:17:12.500
In World War II he earned
the people's respect

00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:16.670
and soon won their
hearts as President-elect.

00:17:16.670 --> 00:17:18.620
Ike made it his mission to plan

00:17:18.620 --> 00:17:23.510
and create a nationwide
network of new interstates.

00:17:23.510 --> 00:17:27.030
These wide open roads
kept America thriving

00:17:27.030 --> 00:17:31.610
and Ellis imagined the
thrill of fast driving."

00:17:31.610 --> 00:17:33.620
That's right there's the eagle

00:17:33.620 --> 00:17:37.290
and can you imagine not having
interstates to drive on?

00:17:37.290 --> 00:17:39.160 position:56%
It's because of President Eisenhower

00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:41.480
that we have this wonderful
interstate system now

00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:45.400
and we can drive our cars on it.

00:17:47.950 --> 00:17:51.810 position:56%
"The early 1960s were a hopeful time

00:17:51.810 --> 00:17:55.400
for a courageous leader
who served in his prime.

00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:59.250
John F. Kennedy asked citizens
to volunteer to improve

00:17:59.250 --> 00:18:02.800
and preserve the nation
they held dear.

00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:05.980
Ellis was inspired by
Kennedy's bold themes

00:18:05.980 --> 00:18:09.620
and how he challenged
Americans to dream big dreams.

00:18:09.620 --> 00:18:13.920
He sent men to the moon within
a few short years to discover

00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:18.470 position:56%
and explore its vast new frontiers."

00:18:18.470 --> 00:18:23.840
And here is President
Kennedy at his inauguration.

00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:31.600
Yes and the eagle is there as well.

00:18:33.050 --> 00:18:37.050
"Lyndon Johnson's years were
anything but calm with unrest

00:18:37.050 --> 00:18:39.630
at home and war in Vietnam.

00:18:39.630 --> 00:18:44.550
While the times made his job
especially tough President Johnson

00:18:44.550 --> 00:18:47.250
did some important stuff.

00:18:47.250 --> 00:18:50.470
With Martin Luther King
he fought discrimination

00:18:50.470 --> 00:18:53.730
to keep a founding promise
of our great nation.

00:18:53.730 --> 00:18:57.660
Together they were determined to
win crucial fights that guaranteed

00:18:57.660 --> 00:19:01.080
to everyone equal civil rights.

00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:03.380
&gt;&gt; I see the eagle next the Ellis.

00:19:03.380 --> 00:19:06.100
&gt;&gt; Callista Gingrich: That's right
and here we have President Johnson

00:19:06.100 --> 00:19:12.250
and Martin Luther King Jr.
Signing the Civil Rights Act.

00:19:12.250 --> 00:19:18.330
That was quite a moment
wasn't it Ellis?

00:19:18.330 --> 00:19:22.260
"Ronald Reagan had faith
in the American way knowing

00:19:22.260 --> 00:19:26.160
that freedom not fear
would carry the day.

00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:29.590
Ellis learned that Reagan
pursued one major goal

00:19:29.590 --> 00:19:33.190
to liberate the world
from Soviet control.

00:19:33.190 --> 00:19:36.730
Reagan went to Berlin
a city split in two

00:19:36.730 --> 00:19:40.710
with one thing he insisted
the Soviets do.

00:19:40.710 --> 00:19:42.830
When he called on their
leaders to tear

00:19:42.830 --> 00:19:48.450
down this wall his words marked
the start of the Communist fall."

00:19:48.450 --> 00:19:51.370
And there's Ellis with
President Reagan in Berlin.

00:19:51.370 --> 00:19:52.670
&gt;&gt; I see the eagle.

00:19:52.670 --> 00:19:53.970
&gt;&gt; Callista Gingrich:
You see the eagle.

00:19:53.970 --> 00:19:55.270
Yeah he gets around.

00:19:55.270 --> 00:19:58.820
He's everywhere in every
single illustration.

00:19:58.820 --> 00:20:00.120
And I just want to add

00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:03.910
that my illustrator Susan
Arciero is a very talented artist

00:20:03.910 --> 00:20:05.210
and we worked together
on this series

00:20:05.210 --> 00:20:07.510
and she really does a nice job.

00:20:09.030 --> 00:20:15.210 position:56%
"Thinking back on all the presidents
he observed Ellis was so grateful

00:20:15.210 --> 00:20:17.350
for those who had served.

00:20:17.350 --> 00:20:21.280
Throughout our history they
gave what was needed and strived

00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:24.800
to ensure that our
country succeeded.

00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:29.520
Each had accepted a great
responsibility and done the job

00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:31.970
to the best of their ability.

00:20:31.970 --> 00:20:36.500
Ellis had tremendous respect and
admiration for the presidents

00:20:36.500 --> 00:20:40.130
who had led this exceptional
nation."

00:20:40.130 --> 00:20:42.630
&gt;&gt; I see the eagle.

00:20:42.630 --> 00:20:44.120
I see the eagle.

00:20:44.120 --> 00:20:45.550
&gt;&gt; Callista Gingrich: The end.

00:20:45.550 --> 00:20:48.520
Great. Thank you.

00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:49.820
Thank you.

00:20:49.820 --> 00:20:53.040 position:56%
Well I hope you enjoyed that because
Ellis and I certainly enjoyed being

00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:57.840
with you today and before we go
we'll come just down off the stage

00:20:57.840 --> 00:21:00.920
and if you'd like the meet
Ellis give him a high five,

00:21:00.920 --> 00:21:02.220
have a picture.

00:21:02.220 --> 00:21:03.520
Would you like that?

00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:05.060
All right let's do that Ellis.

00:21:05.060 --> 00:21:08.580
Thank you so much.

00:21:08.580 --> 00:21:12.010
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
