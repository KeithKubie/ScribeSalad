All right, well.

00:00:16.682 --> 00:00:17.784 align:start size:22% position:78%
Bye.

00:00:17.817 --> 00:00:18.985 align:start position:0%
Bye.

00:00:38.003 --> 00:00:39.139 align:start position:0%
Whew.

00:00:41.474 --> 00:00:44.043 align:start position:0%
Here's the craziest
thing about last night.

00:00:44.076 --> 00:00:46.045 align:start position:0%
Like his body just--

00:00:46.078 --> 00:00:47.547 align:start position:0% line:92%
It felt like home.

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:49.182 align:start size:66% position:34%
Dude, does this taste
skunked to you?

00:00:49.215 --> 00:00:50.650 align:start size:44% position:56%
No.

00:00:50.683 --> 00:00:51.617 align:start position:0%
What does he do?

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:52.985 align:start position:0%
Okay, we did
not get to that,

00:00:53.018 --> 00:00:56.789 align:start position:0%
but according to Google,
like finance, maybe.

00:00:56.822 --> 00:00:58.391 align:start size:59% position:41%
What'd you get into
last night?

00:00:58.424 --> 00:01:01.060 align:start size:28% position:72%
Nothing.

00:01:01.093 --> 00:01:02.695 align:start size:63% position:38%
Actually, I got kind
of hammered.

00:01:02.728 --> 00:01:03.963 align:start position:0%
God, I like,
miss him.

00:01:03.996 --> 00:01:04.964 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna text him.

00:01:04.997 --> 00:01:06.299 align:start position:0%
Oh,
you should wait.

00:01:06.332 --> 00:01:11.337 align:start position:0%
No, the amazing thing
is that we're not playing games.

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:12.872 align:start position:0% line:85%
Oh my God.

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:12.872 align:start size:47% position:53%
( phone alert )

00:01:18.544 --> 00:01:19.679 align:start size:34% position:66%
No idea who
that is.

00:01:23.315 --> 00:01:25.551 align:start position:0%
How hard is it to open
a joint checking account?

00:01:25.584 --> 00:01:27.987 align:start position:0%
And this is for you
and your husband?

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.089 align:start position:0%
Husband?

00:01:30.122 --> 00:01:33.226 align:start position:0%
I--
I guess, I guess.

00:01:44.103 --> 00:01:45.205 align:start position:0%
I have a feeling.

00:01:52.578 --> 00:01:54.580 align:start position:0%
Mm-hmm.

00:01:54.613 --> 00:01:56.716 align:start position:0%
This is it.

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:58.284 align:start position:0%
This is my
wedding cake.

00:02:03.455 --> 00:02:06.559 align:start position:0%
This place
is perfect.

00:02:06.592 --> 00:02:09.662 align:start position:0%
Unless he's Jewish.

00:02:09.695 --> 00:02:10.997 align:start position:0%
Whatever, it's my day,
right?

00:02:12.398 --> 00:02:13.633 align:start position:0%
You know what?

00:02:13.666 --> 00:02:15.635 align:start position:0%
There's one more thing
I'd like to take a look at.

00:02:19.471 --> 00:02:20.406 align:start position:0%
You know what?

00:02:20.439 --> 00:02:21.607 align:start position:0%
I just--
I feel it.

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.577 align:start position:0%
I feel like Matt and I will
just be at peace here.

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:25.611 align:start position:0%
Yeah.

00:02:25.644 --> 00:02:26.579 align:start position:0%
God.

00:02:26.612 --> 00:02:27.813 align:start position:0%
You know what?

00:02:27.846 --> 00:02:31.651 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna call my boo-boo,
see what he's up to.

00:02:31.684 --> 00:02:34.554 align:start size:56% position:44%
( phone ringing )

00:02:34.587 --> 00:02:35.588 align:start size:22% position:78%
Hello?

00:02:35.621 --> 00:02:36.789 align:start position:0%
Hey.

00:02:36.822 --> 00:02:39.091 align:start position:0%
Just at the cemetery,
thinking boutcha.

00:02:39.124 --> 00:02:40.226 align:start position:0%
What are you thinking
for tonight?

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:43.329 align:start position:0%
I'm literally
down for whatever.

00:02:43.362 --> 00:02:45.464 align:start size:41% position:59%
Who is this?

00:02:45.497 --> 00:02:47.967 align:start position:0%
Uh, it's Amy.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.470 size:84% position:42%
We--we hung out last night,
I came back to your place.

00:02:51.503 --> 00:02:54.340 align:start size:41% position:59%
Right, yeah.

00:02:54.373 --> 00:02:56.609 align:start size:66% position:34%
Sorry, I think
I'm gonna take a pass

00:02:56.642 --> 00:02:59.178 align:start size:53% position:47%
on us seeing each
other again.

00:02:59.211 --> 00:03:00.647
Did I wear a bag?

00:03:02.881 --> 00:03:05.318 align:start position:0%
What a dick!

00:03:05.351 --> 00:03:07.053
Ma'am, should
I stop digging?

00:03:07.086 --> 00:03:08.188 align:start position:0%
Yeah.

00:03:10.189 --> 00:03:11.991 align:start position:0%
Wait.

00:03:12.024 --> 00:03:13.326 align:start position:0%
What's your name?

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:14.460 align:start size:59% position:41%
My name's Charles.

00:03:16.962 --> 00:03:19.832 align:start position:0%
Amy Charles.

00:03:19.865 --> 00:03:22.368 align:start position:0%

<i> ( Jess )
 What's wrong?</i>

00:04:08.247 --> 00:04:09.415
Okay, Bobby just text me,

00:04:09.448 --> 00:04:10.850
he wants me to send him, like,
a sexy picture.

00:04:10.883 --> 00:04:12.018
<i> Oh my God, did you?</i>

00:04:12.051 --> 00:04:13.653
No, no, I've been trying

00:04:13.686 --> 00:04:15.154
and they're just,
like, really bad.

00:04:15.187 --> 00:04:16.722
Should I just
send him that one where--

00:04:16.755 --> 00:04:18.291
Remember I met Hillary Clinton
at LaGuardia?

00:04:18.324 --> 00:04:19.425
Should I
send him that one?

00:04:19.458 --> 00:04:20.793
You can, like, basically see
my nipple.

00:04:20.826 --> 00:04:21.927
They made me take it off
Facebook,

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:24.697
so it's
definitely not not sexual.

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:26.165
<i> You're taking them yourself?</i>

00:04:26.198 --> 00:04:28.100

00:04:43.749 --> 00:04:44.850
Hi, thank you.

00:04:44.883 --> 00:04:45.985
Cute place.

00:04:46.018 --> 00:04:47.119
Do you teach art
to cats?

00:04:47.152 --> 00:04:48.254 align:start position:0%
Can I
offer you something?

00:04:48.287 --> 00:04:49.488
Offer me what?

00:04:49.521 --> 00:04:51.157
Half a coconut water
and the dirt from your Brita?

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:52.291
I think I'm actually good,
lonelybones,

00:04:52.324 --> 00:04:53.626
I'm kind of in a rush.

00:04:53.659 --> 00:04:55.928
What do you got already,
let's see.

00:04:55.961 --> 00:04:57.330
Ooh.

00:04:57.363 --> 00:04:59.298
Why the cactus?

00:04:59.331 --> 00:05:02.335 align:start position:0%
That's not a--
that's not a cactus.

00:05:02.368 --> 00:05:04.670
Okay, we need the bush
team on standby,

00:05:04.703 --> 00:05:05.838
it looks like
she's got a Hasidic rabbi

00:05:05.871 --> 00:05:07.106
living in her underpants.

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:08.274
No offense.

00:05:08.307 --> 00:05:09.508 align:start position:0%
Okay.

00:05:09.541 --> 00:05:11.043
We're just gonna clean you up,
it'll take a second.

00:05:11.076 --> 00:05:12.745
20 minutes.

00:05:12.778 --> 00:05:14.880
Don't worry, you're in good
hands, okay?

00:05:14.913 --> 00:05:16.048
I've done everyone's.

00:05:16.081 --> 00:05:18.250
I'm talking Blake Lively,
Scarlett Jo,

00:05:18.283 --> 00:05:19.518
George Lopez.

00:05:19.551 --> 00:05:21.721
It was actually my idea to make
Brett Favre's dick,

00:05:21.754 --> 00:05:22.955
like, bright yellow.

00:05:22.988 --> 00:05:24.123 align:start position:0%
No, that was you?

00:05:24.156 --> 00:05:25.358
That was me.

00:05:25.391 --> 00:05:27.059
Let's get to it.

00:05:27.092 --> 00:05:29.195
Did you
wear that yesterday?

00:05:30.329 --> 00:05:31.764
Yes!

00:05:31.797 --> 00:05:33.232
Very good, but don't forget
your duck mouth,

00:05:33.265 --> 00:05:34.800
don't forget
that duck mouth.

00:05:34.833 --> 00:05:36.102
Now you're in a boat.

00:05:36.135 --> 00:05:38.270
You're in a boat because
you're Pocahontas

00:05:38.303 --> 00:05:39.638
and it's the new world!

00:05:39.671 --> 00:05:41.807 line:92%
Maybe less feathers.

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:44.243
Smile like you don't
have Spanx on.

00:05:44.276 --> 00:05:45.778
Yeah!

00:05:45.811 --> 00:05:47.747
Lay back
and look really alluring.

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:49.849
Well, actually, don't
look dead.

00:05:49.882 --> 00:05:51.016
You're pregnant!

00:05:51.049 --> 00:05:53.719
You're pregnant with
gift cards !

00:05:53.752 --> 00:05:54.920
Yeah!

00:05:54.953 --> 00:05:56.722
Oh-- Are you
gonna ( bleep ) your pants?

00:05:56.755 --> 00:05:57.957
Oh my God, are you gonna
( bleep ) your pants?

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:00.025
You're so comfy.

00:06:00.058 --> 00:06:01.193
Too comfy.

00:06:01.226 --> 00:06:02.361
Too comfy.

00:06:02.394 --> 00:06:04.063
Look, if you don't watch your
( bleep ) shadow,

00:06:04.096 --> 00:06:05.431
I will remove it.

00:06:05.464 --> 00:06:08.167
Here we go.

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:09.402
Yes!

00:06:09.435 --> 00:06:12.104
You've got a secret and only the
pillow can know.

00:06:12.137 --> 00:06:13.506
Wash yourself.

00:06:13.539 --> 00:06:16.041
Wash your whole body and your
armpits and under your boobs.

00:06:16.074 --> 00:06:17.143
Amy!

00:06:17.176 --> 00:06:18.844
Oh no, there's a spider
in your hair!

00:06:18.877 --> 00:06:20.012
There's a spider
in your hair!

00:06:20.045 --> 00:06:21.147 align:start size:22% position:78%
No!

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:23.015
There's a spider in your hair,
get it out!

00:06:23.048 --> 00:06:24.683
Yes!

00:06:24.716 --> 00:06:26.419
We have our shot,
that's a wrap.

00:06:26.452 --> 00:06:27.753
You were amazing.

00:06:27.786 --> 00:06:29.088
Yoko!

00:06:29.121 --> 00:06:31.690
Unplug everything, we're gonna
burn this rat's nest down.

00:06:31.723 --> 00:06:33.159
You were so great.

00:06:33.192 --> 00:06:35.294
I'd love to stay and chat, but
I've got to run downtown.

00:06:35.327 --> 00:06:38.330
I have to shoot Diane Keaton
bottomless with a turtleneck

00:06:38.363 --> 00:06:40.766
like an hour ago, I'm sure you
understand.

00:06:40.799 --> 00:06:44.303
Oh my God, I just don't
know how to thank you.

00:06:44.336 --> 00:06:47.373

extensions but

00:07:06.325 --> 00:07:09.028

Why don't you just get
a glass of wine or something?

No, please, babe!

00:07:32.951 --> 00:07:34.787 align:start size:50% position:50% line:92%
Nice party, huh?

00:07:32.951 --> 00:07:34.787 align:start position:0%
Yeah.

00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:35.754 align:start position:0%
Ooh, I like your shirt.

00:07:35.787 --> 00:07:37.556 align:start size:38% position:63% line:92%
It's ironic.

00:07:35.787 --> 00:07:37.556 align:start position:0%
Right.

00:07:37.589 --> 00:07:38.824 align:start size:19% position:81% line:92%
Right?

00:07:37.589 --> 00:07:38.824 align:start position:0%
That is ironic.

00:07:38.857 --> 00:07:40.059 align:start size:75% position:25%
So how do you know Glen?

00:07:40.092 --> 00:07:41.126 size:81% position:41%
Oh, um, I don't know Glen.

00:07:41.159 --> 00:07:43.762 align:start position:0%
He was my boyfriend's
roommate in college.

00:07:43.795 --> 00:07:46.232 align:start size:75% position:25%
Okay, you don't have
to slip in that you have
a boyfriend, okay?

00:07:46.265 --> 00:07:49.802 align:start size:75% position:25%
I was just making casual
conversation, all right?

00:07:49.835 --> 00:07:52.038 align:start position:0%
You're just a four.
Wow.

00:07:53.238 --> 00:07:53.973
I wasn't even making...

00:07:56.341 --> 00:07:58.444 align:start size:31% position:69% line:83%
Sorry.
Excuse me.

00:07:56.341 --> 00:07:58.444 align:start position:0%
No, no, no, no.
You're fine.

00:07:58.477 --> 00:08:01.280 align:start size:78% position:22%
I haven't even had enough
drinks to be stumbling.

00:08:01.313 --> 00:08:03.082 align:start size:78% position:22%
Which is a sign I should
probably get another one.

00:08:03.115 --> 00:08:04.650 align:start position:0%
Yeah, I hear you.
(chuckles)

00:08:04.683 --> 00:08:05.818 align:start size:75% position:25%
Can I get you something?

00:08:05.851 --> 00:08:08.854 align:start position:0%
Oh, no, no, no.
My boyfriend's grabbing me one.

00:08:08.887 --> 00:08:10.489 align:start size:66% position:34%
Wow, you're arrogant.

00:08:10.522 --> 00:08:11.824 align:start size:53% position:47%
I was just trying
to be nice.

00:08:11.857 --> 00:08:13.959 align:end position:100%
You don't have to cram in
that you have a boyfriend.

00:08:13.992 --> 00:08:15.094 size:75% position:38%
No, I wasn't doing that.

00:08:15.127 --> 00:08:16.428 align:start size:53% position:47%
I only sleep
with Asian girls.

00:08:16.461 --> 00:08:18.497 align:start position:0%
Pretty arrogant.

00:08:18.530 --> 00:08:19.765 align:start position:0%
For a three.

00:08:21.967 --> 00:08:23.302
I'm a four.

00:08:28.907 --> 00:08:31.043
Looks like you don't know too
many people here either, huh?

00:08:31.076 --> 00:08:32.411 align:start size:53% position:47%
Oh, no, I just...

00:08:32.444 --> 00:08:34.547 align:start position:0%
(mouthing)

00:08:36.014 --> 00:08:37.416 align:start size:31% position:69%
No.
(chuckles)

Where are you from?

00:08:37.449 --> 00:08:39.251 align:start size:38% position:63%
Long Island.

00:08:39.284 --> 00:08:41.020 align:start position:0%
Ooh, Long Island,
that's cool.

00:08:41.053 --> 00:08:42.288 align:start size:16% position:84%
Yeah.

00:08:42.321 --> 00:08:45.124 align:start position:0%
Can I get you a drink?

00:08:45.157 --> 00:08:46.759 align:start size:44% position:56%
No, I-- I'm...

00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:50.396 align:start size:69% position:31% line:92%
Yeah, that'd be great.

00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:50.396 align:start position:0%
Yeah?

00:08:50.429 --> 00:08:51.864 align:start position:0% line:85%
What do you want?

00:08:50.429 --> 00:08:51.864 align:start size:34% position:66%
White wine.

00:08:51.897 --> 00:08:53.199 align:start position:0% line:85%
Oh, I'll be right back.

00:08:51.897 --> 00:08:53.199 align:start size:31% position:69%
Thank you.

00:08:55.901 --> 00:08:57.403 align:start position:0% line:85%
Here.

00:08:55.901 --> 00:08:57.403 align:start size:25% position:75%
Oh, wow.

00:08:57.436 --> 00:08:58.571 align:start position:0% line:85%
That was easy.

00:08:57.436 --> 00:08:58.571 align:start size:50% position:50%
(chuckles) Yeah.

00:08:58.604 --> 00:08:59.605 align:start position:0%

00:09:06.678 --> 00:09:08.681 align:start size:78% position:22%
wants a really refreshing
drink like that?

00:09:08.714 --> 00:09:10.249
(both laughing)

00:09:10.282 --> 00:09:11.550 size:81% position:41%

Mmm.

00:09:17.789 --> 00:09:20.225 align:start position:0%

I can't remember.

00:09:22.227 --> 00:09:25.097 align:start size:63% position:38%

00:10:45.577 --> 00:10:49.381 align:start position:0%
I tried to tell you
after Bennett was born,

00:10:49.414 --> 00:10:51.517 size:78% position:39%

Yes, we're not

00:11:52.077 --> 00:11:53.445 align:start size:44% position:56%
We need help.

00:11:53.478 --> 00:11:55.013 align:start position:0%
We're not

00:11:55.046 --> 00:11:56.782 align:start size:47% position:53%
Yeah, we're not

00:11:56.815 --> 00:11:57.850 align:start position:0%

Come on in.

00:12:03.722 --> 00:12:04.957
Thank you so much
for seeing us.

00:12:04.990 --> 00:12:06.192 align:start size:38% position:63%
No problem.

00:12:16.434 --> 00:12:17.670 align:start size:31% position:69%
It's gonna
be fine.

00:12:19.538 --> 00:12:21.340 align:start position:0%
So let's get started.

00:12:21.373 --> 00:12:23.375 align:start position:0%
First of all, how long
have you two been together?

00:12:23.408 --> 00:12:25.677 align:start position:0% line:78%
Four years.

00:12:23.408 --> 00:12:25.677 align:start size:75% position:25%
Well, we had a good run,
if that's what you mean.

00:12:25.710 --> 00:12:27.412 size:75% position:38%
Well, I think it's great
you guys are both here.

00:12:27.445 --> 00:12:29.248 align:start position:0%
It shows that
this relationship

00:12:29.281 --> 00:12:30.816 align:start position:0%
is something that's important
to the both of you.

00:12:30.849 --> 00:12:32.551
I'm sorry,
aren't you a model?

00:12:32.584 --> 00:12:34.353 align:start size:63% position:38%
She's a supermodel.

00:12:34.386 --> 00:12:36.155 align:start size:69% position:31%
You sound like a real
ass(bleep) right now.

00:12:36.188 --> 00:12:37.923 align:start position:0%
I actually was a model,

00:12:37.956 --> 00:12:39.558 align:start position:0%
but now I'm a clinical
social worker

00:12:39.591 --> 00:12:41.193 align:start position:0%
and I really love it.

00:12:41.226 --> 00:12:42.928 align:start position:0%
You know, I'm really
enjoying this now

00:12:42.961 --> 00:12:44.696 align:start position:0%
and I mean, who wants
to ride a horse naked

00:12:44.729 --> 00:12:46.265 align:start position:0%
for the camera
all the time?

00:12:46.298 --> 00:12:48.734 align:start position:0%
I'd rather just
do that on my own.

00:12:48.767 --> 00:12:50.402 align:start position:0%
And as you know, modeling
is great,

00:12:50.435 --> 00:12:52.571 align:start position:0%
but you hit 27
and suddenly, you're old.

00:12:52.604 --> 00:12:54.640 align:start size:63% position:38%
Oh, that's not old.

00:12:54.673 --> 00:12:56.241 align:start size:31% position:69%
Amy's 37.

00:12:56.274 --> 00:12:57.843
I'm 32.

00:12:57.876 --> 00:12:59.778 align:start size:50% position:50%
Yeah, but you're
a drinker.

00:12:59.811 --> 00:13:01.079 align:start position:0%
All right, so let's talk about
what brought you two here.

00:13:01.112 --> 00:13:03.148 align:start size:38% position:63%
I'll start.

00:13:03.181 --> 00:13:05.017 align:start size:22% position:78%
Um...

00:13:05.050 --> 00:13:08.754 align:start size:69% position:31%

I gotta sweat it out.

00:13:17.329 --> 00:13:19.131 align:start size:53% position:47%
Just... (growls)

00:13:19.164 --> 00:13:20.966 align:start position:0%
And Amy?

00:13:20.999 --> 00:13:24.269
Well, I, I feel like
he's cheating on me.

00:13:24.302 --> 00:13:28.307 align:start size:75% position:25%
You just need to learn

00:13:28.340 --> 00:13:32.444 align:start position:0%
Uh, well, these sound
like two very conflicting
perspectives, obviously--

00:13:32.477 --> 00:13:35.781
Can you put your glasses
back on, please?

00:13:35.814 --> 00:13:36.982 align:start position:0%
Of course.

00:13:37.015 --> 00:13:38.150
Thank you.

00:13:38.183 --> 00:13:39.618
No, no.

00:13:39.651 --> 00:13:41.253
No, no, no.

00:13:41.286 --> 00:13:43.255
No,
don't do that.

00:13:43.288 --> 00:13:47.059
Okay, uh, well, he never has sex
with me, like at all.

00:13:47.092 --> 00:13:48.794 align:start size:50% position:50%
It's because
I don't want to.

00:13:48.827 --> 00:13:51.096 align:start position:0%

that make you feel?

00:13:51.129 --> 00:13:55.133

00:14:04.976 --> 00:14:07.079 align:start position:0%
All right, I want

00:14:07.112 --> 00:14:08.614 align:start position:0%

00:14:08.647 --> 00:14:10.482 align:start position:0%

like to do to Amy in bed.

00:14:12.317 --> 00:14:14.019 align:start size:19% position:81% line:92%
Okay--

00:14:12.317 --> 00:14:14.019
No.

00:14:14.052 --> 00:14:15.687
I don't think that's
a good idea for us--

00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:18.423 align:start size:66% position:34%
First, I want to kiss
you for hours.

00:14:18.456 --> 00:14:19.958 align:start size:53% position:47%
And then I want
to run my fingers

00:14:19.991 --> 00:14:22.794 align:start size:56% position:44%
through your long,
dark hair.

00:14:22.827 --> 00:14:25.931 align:start size:72% position:28%
And then
I wanna drive you crazy

00:14:25.964 --> 00:14:29.268 align:start size:75% position:25%

before.

00:14:33.872 --> 00:14:35.374 align:start position:0%
All right,
why don't you now

00:14:35.407 --> 00:14:37.643 align:start position:0%
say those things
directly to Amy?

00:14:37.676 --> 00:14:39.144 align:start size:34% position:66%
It's okay.

00:14:39.177 --> 00:14:40.846 align:start size:63% position:38%
I think she got it.

00:14:40.879 --> 00:14:43.048
I don't think
this is helping at all.

00:14:43.081 --> 00:14:45.050 align:start size:53% position:47%
So it's agreed.
We're on a break.

00:14:45.083 --> 00:14:47.319 align:start position:0%
You know what I like
to do sometimes is kind of

00:14:47.352 --> 00:14:49.354 align:start position:0%

with just one of you.

00:14:49.387 --> 00:14:51.223 align:start position:0%
I think that would be
the smartest deal here.

00:14:51.256 --> 00:14:52.891 align:start size:38% position:63%
Okay, yeah.

00:14:52.924 --> 00:14:54.493 align:start size:75% position:25%
Amy, you'll take
a Citi Bike home, right?

00:14:54.526 --> 00:14:56.328
I've never even used
a Citi Bike.

00:14:56.361 --> 00:14:58.263 align:start size:84% position:16%
It's really easy.
You just use a credit card.

00:14:58.296 --> 00:14:59.831
Actually, Kevin, I think it's
best if I finish with Amy,

00:14:59.864 --> 00:15:01.500 align:start position:0%
