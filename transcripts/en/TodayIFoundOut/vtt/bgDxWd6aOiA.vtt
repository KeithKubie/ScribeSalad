00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:15.230
As you might expect, the rules surrounding
how one goes about donating one’s body FOR

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:20.160
SCIENCE varies a little from region to region,
though the general process and what happens

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.840
after you donate seems to be relatively consistent.

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:27.830
For instance, in the United Kingdom, donating
one’s body typically involves nothing more

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:32.050
than filling out a few forms provided by your
nearest university or medical school.

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:36.710
Under British law and the Human Tissue Act
of 2004, “written and witnessed consent”

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:42.430
is required prior to death for a medical authority
to claim a body and it’s highly recommended

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:46.930
that you make your family aware of your wishes
to expedite the process of transporting your

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:48.250
body after death.

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:52.659
The latter is important as it is possible
in the UK for your next of kin to override

00:00:52.659 --> 00:00:57.690
your final wishes in regards to organ and
body donation, and just in general it’s

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.630
a good idea to process your body quickly lest
it get rejected for not being, for lack of

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:03.890
a better phrase, fresh enough.

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:09.009
Speaking of organ donation and body rejection,
in most cases being an organ donor whose organs

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:14.290
are harvested will disqualify you from subsequently
donating your body to science directly (though

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:18.990
there is a potential loophole in the United
States in going through a body broker, which

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.520
we’ll get to shortly).

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:26.429
However, it is possible to be both a body
and organ donor simultaneously regardless

00:01:26.429 --> 00:01:30.490
of what side of the pond you’re on; in this
case, in the event that your organs are deemed

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:35.039
unsuitable for transplantation, the relevant
medical authority you’ve willed ownership

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:39.570
of your body to can then choose to take your
body or not at their discretion.

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.069
On that note, while there are no universal
rules for what condition your body has to

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:47.020
be in at the time of death for a medical authority
to be able to make use of it, a number of

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:50.780
things can exclude you immediately from being
considered.

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:54.159
For instance, you’ll almost certainly be
disqualified from donating your body if you

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:59.100
die of a communicable illness or “anything
that doesn’t have a known cause but which

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.369
may be communicable”.

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:05.649
In fact, among the first things done to donated
bodies, beyond refrigerating them to slow

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:08.319
decomposition, is to test them for any infectious
diseases.

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:12.980
After this, the body will typically be embalmed,
though there are exceptions to this, such

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:17.900
as if it’s being used for study on how the
body decomposes naturally over time in certain

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.510
scenarios, as is sometime done with CSI training
or investigation.

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:26.430
Another way your body will usually be disqualified
is if you die in a manner which renders it

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:27.689
in any way abnormal.

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:32.290
So, for example, if you die in a severe car
crash or from a disease which wastes away

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:37.180
your organs or muscle, it may be rejected
due to the fact that institutions accepting

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:42.160
bodies usually only want cadavers that are
representative of a healthy adult.

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:46.959
As one source puts it: “In a way, to successfully
donate your body, you have to be in perfect

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:47.959
health.

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:48.959
But dead.”

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:51.640
But, again, there are always exceptions and,
for example, researchers wanting to study

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:56.290
some disease or the effects of a given car
crash may be interested in your body, just

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:01.300
particularly in the latter case that can be
hard to arrange beforehand.

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:06.500
Even if your body is relatively unscathed
at the time of death, if you die under mysterious

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:10.969
or suspicious circumstances and an autopsy
needs to be performed, there’s a good chance

00:03:10.969 --> 00:03:14.049
this too will result in your body being rejected.

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:18.360
Other things that can result in your body
being rejected, according to one non-exhaustive

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:22.750
list provided by the University of Liverpool
include: bedsores being present on your body

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:27.040
at the time of death, dying of an aortic aneurysm
and being obese.

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:31.090
Your body could also potentially be rejected
if the relevant medical authority simply has

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:35.329
no room for more bodies or you happen to die
at a time of year when nobody is around to

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:40.379
study your corpse in a relatively timely manner,
such as during the holidays in late December.

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:44.770
It’s also important to note that in the
event your body is rejected, the medical authority

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:49.640
you willed it to will take no responsibility
for your body’s disposal and the relevant

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:52.400
funerary costs will, thus, fall to your estate.

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:57.129
On the other hand, if your body is accepted,
the medical authority studying it will often,

00:03:57.129 --> 00:04:01.540
depending on the wishes of you or your family,
cremate the remains free of charge, or otherwise

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:04.659
return them to your family for a private service
at your own expense.

00:04:04.659 --> 00:04:08.499
Interestingly, because medical institutions
potentially cover the costs of the disposal

00:04:08.499 --> 00:04:13.709
of your body, a not insignificant number Britons
have relatively recently started to opt into

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:17.721
donating their body “to science” in the
hopes that if their body is accepted, their

00:04:17.721 --> 00:04:27.040
loved ones won’t have to pay expensive funeral
costs, which in Britain in 2016 averaged about

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:30.610
£3,702 (~$5,000) per funeral.

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:35.060
Over in the United States, the criteria for
donating a body to science is basically the

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:39.919
same and require you to sign a few forms signalling
consent prior to death and, again, it’s

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:44.710
a good idea to inform your family of your
wishes in regards to body disposal because,

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:49.490
as in the UK, the ultimate decision of what
happens to your body rests with your kin.

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:53.870
As the Forensic Anthropology Center of the
University of Tennessee puts it:

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:58.590
Regardless of what you have arranged, signed
or instructed, your family or next-of-kin

00:04:58.590 --> 00:04:59.930
has the final say.

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:02.300
We will not fight your family for your body.

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:07.479
We urge you to convince your family that the
donation is what you want at your death.

00:05:07.479 --> 00:05:11.280
Also like in the UK, certain factors can render
your body unsuitable for study and, for the

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:15.430
most part, they’re fairly comparable- death
from extreme trauma, infectious disease and

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:19.840
certain cancers can all cause your body to
be rejected, as can being obese.

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:24.110
On that note, most medical institutions in
the United States place a height and weight

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:29.639
limit on the cadavers they’ll accept, usually
limited to 6 feet (1.83 meters) and a max

00:05:29.639 --> 00:05:36.419
of between 180-200 lbs (82-91 kg) depending
on the medical institution.

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:39.979
The main reasons for these restrictions are
practical in nature, with it being noted that

00:05:39.979 --> 00:05:44.340
transporting obese bodies is more difficult
and that the medical tables typically used

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:49.210
aren’t large enough to accommodate pleasantly
plump corpses or those who’re very tall.

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:53.500
On top of this, dissecting obese bodies is
also more difficult owing to having to slice

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:56.430
through a lot of fat just to get to what’s
being studied.

00:05:56.430 --> 00:06:00.110
Having organs and arteries and the like a
bit more accessible thanks to low body fat

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:02.509
percentage is just easier to work with.

00:06:02.509 --> 00:06:06.900
Or, as Louisiana State University professor
Steven Heymsfield very frankly states, “When

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:11.820
you’re doing medical dissection, and you’re
up to your elbows in fat, it’s greasy and

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:12.940
unpleasant.”

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:17.930
In the UK, no such height limit is explicitly
specified in any literature we could find,

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:20.259
although especially large persons (either
in regards to height or weight) are advised

00:06:20.259 --> 00:06:24.590
that their bodies might be rejected, with
the common reason listed being difficulty

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:26.000
in moving the body.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.850
Unlike Britons, thanks to competition for
bodies being stiff in the states, American

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:33.000
citizens who are somewhat petite have a great
deal of choice when it comes to donating their

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.000
body to science.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.710
And if you’re now wondering why competition
is high in the land of the descendants of

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:39.770
traitors to the British crown, besides the
larger number of institutions needing bodies,

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:44.440
only a small fraction of the 100 million or
so people who opt into organ donation end

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:48.050
up opting to alternately donate their body
to science.

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:53.099
This is despite full body donation arguably
being just as beneficial as organ donation,

00:06:53.099 --> 00:06:57.620
if not more so in some cases in that the benefit
to science can potential help many people,

00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:01.110
instead of just a maximum of a handful as
in organ donation.

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:07.009
(And, note, as with organ donation, a single
body can, and often is, used for several research

00:07:07.009 --> 00:07:08.009
projects.)

00:07:08.009 --> 00:07:12.319
As the Associate Director for Education at
Indiana University School of Medicine, Ernest

00:07:12.319 --> 00:07:16.629
Talarico, notes, “You literally help tens
of thousands, hundreds of thousands with donation.

00:07:16.629 --> 00:07:21.680
It’s not only those who learn from you;
it’s also the research and those who learn

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:23.520
from the research.”

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:26.940
Because of the high need for bodies, some
companies in the U.S. have made a fortune

00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:30.740
acting as a middleman of sorts between families
and scientific institutions.

00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:34.440
Said companies generally offer to pay the
costs of cremation and the transportation

00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:37.810
and storage of the body to and from wherever
it is needed.

00:07:37.810 --> 00:07:42.120
For instance, Science Care has taken the idea
to its logical extreme, comparing themselves

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:46.220
to McDonald’s in that they deliver a product
(in this case, human bodies and body parts)

00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:51.020
of consistent quality regardless of where
the institution wanting the body or body part

00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:52.539
is in the country.

00:07:52.539 --> 00:07:59.280
In fact, it’s reported from 2012-2014 alone,
Science Care brought in a cool $12.5 million

00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:03.960
selling human remains, which is only publicly
known due to certain court filings.

00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:09.570
Another body broker, Research for Life, notes
they typically get about “$2,500-$3,000”

00:08:09.570 --> 00:08:11.150
profit per full body.

00:08:11.150 --> 00:08:15.240
As for gross cost, documents from another
body broker, Biological Resource Center, showed

00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:22.280
they were charging $5,893 per whole body in
2013, but could potentially make more if slicing

00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:23.280
the body up.

00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:30.470
For instance, they listed a price of $1,900
for a spine, $3,500 for a torso, and $1,300

00:08:30.470 --> 00:08:31.470
for a leg…

00:08:31.470 --> 00:08:34.840
One of the main controversies with such for-profit
body brokers is that it’s not clear how

00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:39.020
many of the people signing up to them realise
these companies generate income by selling

00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:43.969
body parts (or whole bodies) from those who
donate their deceased selves to the companies.

00:08:43.969 --> 00:08:47.399
To be fair, though, it should be noted that,
at least in the case of Science Care, their

00:08:47.399 --> 00:08:52.330
donor consent form does explicitly state the
for-profit nature of the company.

00:08:52.330 --> 00:08:55.630
And for those wanting to increase the odds
that their family won’t have to shell out

00:08:55.630 --> 00:08:59.990
any money for disposing of one’s remains,
companies like these do offer a reasonably

00:08:59.990 --> 00:09:01.190
good outlet.

00:09:01.190 --> 00:09:05.470
As previously noted, some body brokers also
allow you to donate your organs first and

00:09:05.470 --> 00:09:08.440
then they take the rest of you to sell off
at their discretion.

00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:11.800
With most all of these companies, though,
you just have to understand that what happens

00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:15.950
to your body after they get it isn’t generally
something you or your loved ones have much

00:09:15.950 --> 00:09:16.950
say in.

00:09:16.950 --> 00:09:19.950
For instance, certain of these organizations
have taken advantage of the fact that there

00:09:19.950 --> 00:09:24.350
is little in the way of oversight in the body
donation industry (unlike organ donation,

00:09:24.350 --> 00:09:29.200
which is regulated), sometimes using bodies
in ways explicitly against the wishes of the

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:31.470
deceased when they filled out the paper work.

00:09:31.470 --> 00:09:35.029
Other such companies simply note right on
the application form that they can’t be

00:09:35.029 --> 00:09:39.019
sure what your body or body parts will ultimately
be used for.

00:09:39.019 --> 00:09:43.550
So, as with everything in life, even in death,
if you’re getting a product for free, odds

00:09:43.550 --> 00:09:45.360
are reasonable you’re the product.

00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:49.650
It’s just that in this case the old adage
is a little more literal than usual.

00:09:49.650 --> 00:09:54.160
Some people, of course, have a huge problem
with such for-profit body broker companies,

00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:57.440
while others are just happy to maximize the
odds of their loved ones not having to pay

00:09:57.440 --> 00:10:02.780
for an expensive burial or cremation, caring
little about what’s done with their corpse.

00:10:02.780 --> 00:10:08.010
Moving swiftly on, whether donating to a medical
institution directly or to a body broker,

00:10:08.010 --> 00:10:12.899
there’s a wide range of career options available
to the discerning corpse, not just in giving

00:10:12.899 --> 00:10:16.880
medical students incredibly valuable practice
working on a human body that doesn’t care

00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:18.100
if they screw up.

00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:22.440
As for these dead body career options, doctors
may use your body to train in some new and

00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:25.500
innovative surgical method or with some new
piece of equipment.

00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:28.900
Being able to use your corpse for this can
be a huge benefit in reducing the risk of

00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:30.920
mistakes when operating on the living.

00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:35.490
A somewhat more exciting cadaver career path
can be found at the University of Tennessee’s

00:10:35.490 --> 00:10:39.290
Forensic Anthropology Center where they have
been watching bodies decompose in various

00:10:39.290 --> 00:10:41.350
ways for about three decades now.

00:10:41.350 --> 00:10:45.149
(If you live within 200 miles and they accept
your body, they’ll even transport it for

00:10:45.149 --> 00:10:46.149
free.)

00:10:46.149 --> 00:10:49.600
One of the many ways in which they might use
your body is to mimic various ways in which

00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:53.940
people are murdered and then just observe
the effects on your body, possibly even over

00:10:53.940 --> 00:10:55.279
spans of many years.

00:10:55.279 --> 00:11:00.990
They also might use a living picture of you
to observe the change in your visage to help

00:11:00.990 --> 00:11:04.550
them figure out how a given corpse probably
looked in life.

00:11:04.550 --> 00:11:09.459
This and many other such experiments provide
incredibly valuable data to a variety of fields,

00:11:09.459 --> 00:11:12.620
most notably in this case crime scene investigation.

00:11:12.620 --> 00:11:16.910
If being murdered after you die and then observed
as you decompose isn’t your thing, when

00:11:16.910 --> 00:11:20.730
you donate your body, some institutions allow
for selecting to donate for “Safety Testing”.

00:11:20.730 --> 00:11:22.080
If you check that box, your body then may
be used as a crash test dummy.

00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:25.310
While this might seem a bit bizarre if you’ve
never heard of it before, the use of dead

00:11:25.310 --> 00:11:29.930
bodies in car safety testing is something
every car manufacturer benefits from when

00:11:29.930 --> 00:11:33.070
testing some new safety device or car design.

00:11:33.070 --> 00:11:38.310
Although, when asked, most seem prone to outright
deny they test in this way.

00:11:38.310 --> 00:11:42.420
For some, it’s technically true that they
don’t in that they may simply donate funds

00:11:42.420 --> 00:11:46.190
to various medical institutions that in turn
at the behest of the company and the National

00:11:46.190 --> 00:11:51.000
Highway Traffic Administration use bodies
to test various cars and car safety equipment.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:56.200
So it’s not technically the car company
doing it.

00:11:56.200 --> 00:12:00.080
Depending on the nature of the deal, the data
collected may be available to all car companies

00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:04.970
(and the public) or, in some cases, such as
with Ford’s inflatable seat belts, the information

00:12:04.970 --> 00:12:09.500
may only be shared with the company and the
National Highway Traffic Administration.

00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:13.300
In these proprietary cases, the information
is declared by the company as confidential

00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:18.200
business information so that it’s not even
available through a Freedom of Information

00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:19.449
Act request to the NHTA.

00:12:19.449 --> 00:12:22.779
Perhaps gruesome to some, use of your body
in this way can potentially save thousands

00:12:22.779 --> 00:12:27.980
of lives, as no artificial crash test dummy
perfectly mimics the human body like, well,

00:12:27.980 --> 00:12:29.260
a human body can.

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:33.320
As former Ford safety researcher Priya Prasad
notes, “Even though we have very good math

00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:36.880
modeling of dummies, human modeling hasn’t
reached that state yet.”

00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:41.670
(For anyone wondering, we checked and as far
as we can tell neither Ferrari nor Lamborghini

00:12:41.670 --> 00:12:42.830
offer such a program.

00:12:42.830 --> 00:12:44.664
That could mean they really don’t use human
bodies in crash tests, or it could mean they,

00:12:44.664 --> 00:12:47.850
like seemingly all major car companies, don’t
like to admit they do or otherwise fund such

00:12:47.850 --> 00:12:48.850
research on their cars.

00:12:48.850 --> 00:12:52.360
Either way, given the number of non-sports
car models produced is much greater than the

00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:57.510
blazing fast variety, keep in mind that if
you opt to have your body used in safety testing

00:12:57.510 --> 00:13:01.670
and you’re selected for crash testing, your
corpse will probably end up stuck driving

00:13:01.670 --> 00:13:03.800
a rather boring family car.)

00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:08.000
Beyond crash tests, there are countless other
ways in which your body might be used if you

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.640
opt for safety testing, including in testing
various helmet types.

00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:15.790
In fact, some dead people’s heads are presently
being used to design better helmets for those

00:13:15.790 --> 00:13:20.180
who participate in American Football- as you
can imagine, the NFL is particularly interested

00:13:20.180 --> 00:13:24.019
in this line of research, but it’s also
potentially massively beneficial for the many

00:13:24.019 --> 00:13:26.510
thousands of teens who play the sport.

00:13:26.510 --> 00:13:31.740
In the end, if something is used to protect
a human in some way and it’s made by a major

00:13:31.740 --> 00:13:36.380
corporation, odds are strong at some point
said device was tested on dead people, generally

00:13:36.380 --> 00:13:41.000
via grants given to medical institutions who
actually have access to the bodies.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.800
If having your head put in prototype helmets
and bashed up against hard surfaces or having

00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:49.860
your body involved in a mini-van crash isn’t
your thing, another, slightly more badass

00:13:49.860 --> 00:13:54.070
sounding, option is to donate your body to
a medical institution and, assuming the option

00:13:54.070 --> 00:13:55.690
is available, opt into use by the military.

00:13:55.690 --> 00:13:59.759
If accepted, your body will likely be loaded
with state of the art sensors and then used

00:13:59.759 --> 00:14:04.220
to help test new weapons and armor, or just
used in things like testing a given explosion’s

00:14:04.220 --> 00:14:05.759
affect on a human body.

00:14:05.759 --> 00:14:10.199
Yes, if you’d like to help protect the troops
or to help in the design of weapons for making

00:14:10.199 --> 00:14:15.060
more bodies, you too can potentially have
your corpse blown up FOR MILITARY SCIENCE!

00:14:15.060 --> 00:14:19.050
Or, if you’re more of a pacifist, you may
have the option to spend the afterlife as

00:14:19.050 --> 00:14:20.120
a skeleton…

00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:24.949
But not like other skeletons- a skeleton examined
by countless researchers.

00:14:24.949 --> 00:14:29.259
Yes, there are numerous anthropology departments
across America who can take your body and

00:14:29.259 --> 00:14:31.860
strip it down to such for study and research.

00:14:31.860 --> 00:14:35.860
In these cases, of course, your skeleton will
likely not be cremated or otherwise returned

00:14:35.860 --> 00:14:36.930
to your loved ones.

00:14:36.930 --> 00:14:40.160
On this note, the University of Tennessee
currently boasts an impressive collection

00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:45.670
over around 1,000 full human skeletons, noting,
“Every individual donated to the skeletal

00:14:45.670 --> 00:14:49.960
collection is also used to educate, train
and provide a resource for research in forensic

00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:50.960
taphonomy…”

00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:54.949
And for the extreme exhibitionists among you,
it’s even possible to donate your body,

00:14:54.949 --> 00:14:58.139
or at least part of it, to be put on public
display.

00:14:58.139 --> 00:15:02.520
Besides the famed Body Worlds exhibition,
The Mutter Museum in Philadelphia is one such

00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:03.520
option for such.

00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:06.820
So to sum up, whatever you’d like your body
to be used for once you’re done with it,

00:15:06.820 --> 00:15:10.930
donating your body “to science” is simply
a matter of first contacting a relevant authority

00:15:10.930 --> 00:15:15.080
or institution- usually your local medical
school is your best bet, though if you just

00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:19.250
want the free body disposal and don’t care
what’s done with your corpse, a body broker

00:15:19.250 --> 00:15:21.430
isn’t necessarily a bad option.

00:15:21.430 --> 00:15:25.540
Either way, you’ll then only need to fill
out a few quick forms to signal your consent

00:15:25.540 --> 00:15:26.630
to make it happen.

00:15:26.630 --> 00:15:30.910
And best to also explicitly mention to your
loved ones that those are your wishes to make

00:15:30.910 --> 00:15:33.400
sure things go smoothly after you die.

00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:37.730
Also, for most every option, you should generally
plan that your estate may need to at the least

00:15:37.730 --> 00:15:42.500
pay for transport of your body, and possibly
that your body will be rejected when the time

00:15:42.500 --> 00:15:46.290
comes, meaning funds for a more typical body
disposal will be needed.

00:15:46.290 --> 00:15:50.310
And, hey, if your body is accepted and the
institution chooses to go ahead and handle

00:15:50.310 --> 00:15:55.240
all the fees, that’s just extra money freed
up for use by your loved ones to throw a better

00:15:55.240 --> 00:15:57.839
party in your honour with.

00:15:57.839 --> 00:16:02.339
It’s speculated that the likely reasons
for the large disparity between people opting

00:16:02.339 --> 00:16:06.880
into organ donation vs. full body donation
in the United States are that donating one’s

00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:13.110
entire body is somewhat stigmatized, rather
than celebrated as in organ donation; arranging

00:16:13.110 --> 00:16:17.380
to donate your body requires slightly more
effort than just checking a box on a form

00:16:17.380 --> 00:16:21.529
when renewing your license or the like; and
the average American male particularly simply

00:16:21.529 --> 00:16:27.329
has a body outside of the height/weight range
usually accepted by medical institutions (max

00:16:27.329 --> 00:16:30.519
of ~180-200 lbs and 6ft tall).

00:16:30.519 --> 00:16:36.019
For reference here, the average adult American
male rings in at about 195 pounds and 5 feet

00:16:36.019 --> 00:16:39.880
10 inches (1.8 meters) tall according to the
CDC.

00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:43.819
Given that this is more the norm than the
more physically fit bodies many medical students

00:16:43.819 --> 00:16:47.920
and doctors practice on, there has been some
call of late to start accepting bodies with

00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:51.980
a bit more girth and height so said medical
students will end up getting more first-hand

00:16:51.980 --> 00:16:56.709
experience with the type of bodies they’re
likely to frequently work on in their career.

00:16:56.709 --> 00:17:00.720
However, the practical side of things still
rules the day at present, though many institutions

00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:05.100
are starting to transition to bigger tables
and particularly loosening their guidelines

00:17:05.100 --> 00:17:07.530
on weight restriction on accepted bodies.

00:17:07.530 --> 00:17:11.500
As professor Heymsfield goes on to state,
“I don’t think you need a room full of

00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:15.170
obese cadavers, but I still think there’s
a usefulness for students.

00:17:15.170 --> 00:17:19.270
I think to give them a sense of what the effects
of obesity can be on a person’s body.

00:17:19.270 --> 00:17:31.690
There’s nothing like the real thing.”
