00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.129
If two black holes collide in space and nobody’s
around to hear it, did they make a sound.

00:00:05.129 --> 00:00:06.680
It turns out, YES.

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:08.970
And we can hear them, with the help of a supercomputer.

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:10.090
That’s right, folks.

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:14.370
Every few minutes a pair of black holes smash
into each other, apparently, which is something

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.109
no one told me about until now, like it’s
not the coolest thing ever?

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:22.800
When black holes collide, also known as black
hole mergers, they cause ripples that travel

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.249
through spacetime--this is what we call gravitational
waves.

00:00:26.249 --> 00:00:30.249
As you may have heard, 2015 marked the first
time we were able to detect gravitational

00:00:30.249 --> 00:00:36.079
waves, arguably one of the biggest astronomical
discoveries of the 21st century and confirmation

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:39.430
of Einstein’s 1915 theory of general relativity.

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:40.430
No big deal.

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:44.809
And while there are some gravitational-wave
producing events that are distinctly measurable--that

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:47.930
we have observed and recorded--there’s also
what researchers call the gravitational-wave

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:48.930
background.

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.969
This is basically background noise resulting
from all the hundreds of thousands of gravitational-wave

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:57.880
producing events, like black hole collisions,
that we can’t distinguish individually because

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:00.199
our equipment isn’t sensitive enough to
discern them.

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:05.159
We haven’t even been able to detect the
background noise as a whole YET, but new research

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.430
is out from a team that’s developing sensitive
ways of listening to space that may allow

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:13.119
us to detect it faster than we’d previously
thought possible.

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:15.909
And of course, they’re using a supercomputer
to do it.

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:20.090
These researchers are using a particular kind
of computer simulation, called Monte Carlo

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:24.540
simulation, to produce a kind of ‘practice’
background noise that they can listen to.

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.619
With a new and unique search strategy, they’ve
shown they can identify gravitational-wave

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.380
producing events within the “practice”
noise.

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:36.770
Their new methods mean they can perform this
search with about a day’s worth of calculation,

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:40.659
whereas by the previously existing method
it would take up to 40 months to detect the

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:41.710
same thing.

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:46.329
Plus, the researchers say that their method
is a thousand times more sensitive than previous

00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:47.329
attempts.

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:50.490
We’re talking some serious sensitivity,
here.

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:55.009
Gravitational waves that we can pick up produce
a disruption in space about 10,000 times smaller

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:57.149
than the radius of a proton.

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.720
And that’s the ones we can detect and distinguish.

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:04.670
So, this team is making improvements in detection,
but not with the actual measuring or listening

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:06.180
capabilities we’ve developed.

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:11.120
Instead they’re working by improving data
analysis and basically, number-crunching technique

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:12.239
and capacity.

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:13.930
Wizardry, it’s wizardry.

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:17.590
To speed things along even further, as of
March of this year the researchers have access

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:21.900
to a new 4 million dollar supercomputer, allowing
them to search for this background noise for

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.400
real, not just in simulation.

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.320
In the future, the researchers think that
extensions of their research could be used

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:32.700
to study gravitational waves that originated
very far away, in both space and in time...potentially

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:37.350
even letting us see and listen to gravitational
waves leftover from the Big bang, which are

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:39.260
currently hidden behind more recent events.

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.850
So, we don’t know what the background noise
sounds like yet.

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:44.090
That’s the goal.

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:49.290
But individual gravitational waves that are
relatively close to us in space time sound….Kind

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:50.700
of chirpy!

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:56.850
Have 
a listen.

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:00.319
I don’t know about you, but my takeaway
from this is that computers basically could

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:04.280
be our best bet at understanding where our
universe came from, and that understanding

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:08.930
how to work with them could help us look at
the fabric of spacetime (which will never

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:10.720
not be the coolest phrase ever).

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.709
Need more gravitational waves in your life?

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:16.530
Subscribe to Seeker and check out this video
on how they could help us understand dark

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:17.530
matter.

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:21.239
And, fun fact, gravitational waves vary based
on the properties of the objects that smashed

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:25.159
into each other, basically like a thumbprint
of a unique spacetime event.

00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:26.939
Thanks for watching Seeker, I’m Maren.
