00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:02.850
The continuous
function f is defined

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:05.000
on the interval
negative 4 is less than

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.870
or equal to x is less
than or equal to 3.

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:11.480
The graph of f consists of two
quarter circles and one line

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:12.330
segment.

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.620
So this right here is
one quarter circle,

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:16.350
then we have another
quarter circle,

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.850
and then it has this
line segment over here,

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:20.080
as shown in the figure above.

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:21.746
I put the figure on
the side, so that we

00:00:21.746 --> 00:00:24.170
have some screen real
estate down here.

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:28.450
Let g of x be equal to 2x plus
the definite integral from 0

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:31.020
to x of f of t dt.

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:33.320
All right, that's a
little bit interesting.

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:34.970
Now, let's do Part a.

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:35.690
Part a.

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:38.030
Find g of negative 3.

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:40.350
So we want to find
g of negative 3.

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.680
So first of all, it
tells us what g of x is.

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.239
So g of negative 3,
every time we see an x,

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:46.530
we just put a negative 3 there.

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.790
So it's going to
be 2 times negative

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:56.610
3 plus the definite integral
from 0 to negative 3, f

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.730
of t dt.

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.930
So this first part is
pretty straightforward.

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:05.604
2 times negative
3 is negative 6.

00:01:05.604 --> 00:01:07.020
And then this part
right over here

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.335
is the definite integral from
0 to negative 3 of f of t dt.

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:21.470
So this is essentially
the area under f of t--

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:25.724
or under f of x, if you want to
view it that way-- from 0 to 3.

00:01:25.724 --> 00:01:27.140
And this is pretty
straightforward

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:29.840
to figure out but we
have to be careful here.

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.380
Because this area
right over here,

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:35.750
this would be the integral--
let me do this in a color

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:36.810
that you can see.

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.720
That area right
over there would be

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:45.590
the integral from
negative 3 to 0 f of t,

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:50.460
or we could even say f of t
dt or f of x dx, either way.

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.460
That would be this
area right over here.

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:53.430
They've swapped it.

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.750
They have the larger
number as the lower bound.

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:57.920
They have 0 as the lower bound.

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.090
So what we could do,
we could rewrite this.

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.250
This is the same thing,
this is equal to negative 6

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:06.880
minus-- if you swap the
bounds of integration,

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.139
you swap the sign
on the integral.

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:16.810
So we could say minus from
negative 3 to 0 of f of t dt.

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:19.920
And now this thing right over
here-- this expression right

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:25.485
over here is the area
under this quarter circle.

00:02:25.485 --> 00:02:27.110
And the area under
this quarter circle,

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:29.670
we can just use a little bit
of geometry to figure that out.

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.160
We know its radius.

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.350
The radius here is 3.

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:34.960
Radius is equal to 3.

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:37.580
The entire circle
is pi r squared.

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:39.780
So the entire circle--
the area if this

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:45.960
was an entire circle right over
here-- that area would be pi r

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:46.460
squared.

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:48.280
So pi times 3 squared.

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:49.680
So 9 pi.

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:54.580
So it would be 9 pi, but this is
only 1/4 of the entire circle.

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:56.290
So we want to divide it by 4.

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:59.290
So this right over here we'll
evaluate to 9 pi over 4.

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:03.450
So Part a, we get it's
equal to negative 6, that's

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:11.630
that right over there,
minus 9 pi over 4.

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:13.710
And that's at least the
first part of Part a.

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:16.030
Then they say find g prime of x.

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:19.430
So let's find g prime of x.

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:22.380
We did the first part of
Part a right over there.

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:25.842
Then we need to
find g prime of x.

00:03:25.842 --> 00:03:28.050
Well, it's just going to be
the derivative of g of x.

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:31.439
The derivative of 2x
is just going to be 2.

00:03:31.439 --> 00:03:33.980
And then the derivative-- and
this is the fundamental theorem

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:36.190
of calculus right over
here-- the derivative

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:39.350
of the definite integral
from 0 to x of f of t dt,

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:40.705
that's just going to be f of x.

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:45.740
So that is g prime of x.

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:48.260
We did this second
part right over there.

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.840
That is g prime of x.

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.580
And then we need to
evaluate it at negative 3.

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:58.510
So g prime of
negative 3 is going

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:02.510
to be equal to 2
plus f of negative 3,

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:06.300
which is equal to 2 plus-- and
let's look at our-- let's see

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:08.500
what f of negative 3 is.

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:10.030
This is our function definition.

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:14.120
When x is equal to negative
3, our function is at 0.

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:16.329
So f of negative 3 is just 0.

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:19.680
So it's just two plus
0, which is equal to 2.

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:22.300
So g of negative
3 is equal to 2.

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:24.295
And we're done with Part a.

00:04:24.295 --> 00:04:25.920
And the trickiest
part of this is just

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:28.580
realizing the bounds
of integration.

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:31.565
That you might be tempted to
say, oh, the integral between 0

00:04:31.565 --> 00:04:33.690
and negative 3, that's
just this area over here

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:35.330
because we're going
between 0 and negative 3.

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:37.060
But you've got to
realize that we actually

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:39.310
have to swap them and make
them negative if you really

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:41.780
want to consider this
area right over here.

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:44.470
That this integral is going to
be the negative of this area.

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:46.928
And that's what we did when we
went through this step right

00:04:46.928 --> 00:04:47.780
over there.
