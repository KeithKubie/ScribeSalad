00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:03.930
I've been asked to make
predictions for the year 2060,

00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:06.317
or 50 years in the future.

00:00:06.317 --> 00:00:07.900
And I thought I would
focus this video

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:10.680
on things that I feel
pretty good about

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:13.920
or things that I feel are
close to my heart and hopefully

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.030
things that things
like the Khan Academy

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:17.970
might be able to bring about.

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.764
So the first big change I
expect in the next 50 years--

00:00:20.764 --> 00:00:23.430
and I actually don't think it'll
take 50 years for it to happen.

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.410
It'll probably
happen fairly quickly

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.450
over the next 10 years--
is that the classroom

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:29.400
model fundamentally changes.

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.170
So classroom different.

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:34.840
And it's going to change
from a model like this,

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.536
and not all classrooms
look like this.

00:00:36.536 --> 00:00:37.910
There are already
classrooms that

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:39.680
are exploring
different types of ways

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:41.380
for students to
interact with each other

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:42.670
and with the professor.

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:45.462
But still, in most
classrooms of the world,

00:00:45.462 --> 00:00:47.420
especially if you take
the introductory courses

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:50.190
at most universities, you'll
see something like this.

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.750
You'll see a professor lecturing
in some way and a bunch

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:56.380
of students sitting
in rows taking notes,

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:58.930
and then they'll take an
exam at the end of the term.

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:02.970
In probably, frankly, 10 years,
this is going to go away,

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:04.030
completely go away.

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:05.870
You won't have people
passively sitting

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:07.770
in lecture halls taking notes.

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.480
So we're going to move
from a passive model,

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:14.250
taking lectures completely--
and this is already

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.560
happening to a certain
degree-- completely

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:23.580
to an active, I would call it,
discovery and creative model.

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.520
So the classroom of the future
will look something much more

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:27.040
like this.

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:29.850
In fact, you might not
even call it a classroom.

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.690
You would call it a room or
some type of project room

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:35.110
or something like that.

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:36.610
And the general
idea is right now

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:41.540
all of these resources are spent
for people to passively get

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:43.920
information from a professor.

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.180
When that is
necessary-- and there

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:48.820
will be times where you want
to learn a little bit of what

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:51.374
someone else discovered about
calculus or quantum physics

00:01:51.374 --> 00:01:53.540
or anything like that--
that'll be at your own time,

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:54.450
at your own pace.

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.330
And we can pretend like that's
happening to this gentleman

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:58.190
right over there, and
maybe he's even able

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:00.070
to practice some of
those core skills.

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:03.430
But a bulk of the time
will be spent doing this,

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:05.750
will be doing-- building
things, creating things,

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:06.459
exploring things.

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:08.708
And it doesn't just have to
be science and technology.

00:02:08.708 --> 00:02:11.420
These people look like they're
building some type of a robot.

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:18.380
It could be painting a
picture or composing a sonata

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:20.281
or choreographing a dance.

00:02:20.281 --> 00:02:22.280
Whatever it might be,
it's going to be much more

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.390
active, discovery-based,
and creative.

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:27.264
And actually, one,
I think this is

00:02:27.264 --> 00:02:29.180
going to happen
technologically, because a lot

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:35.170
of the stuff that's happening
in this model right over here

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:37.080
can start to happen
a little bit more

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:38.970
efficiently through this model.

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:40.380
So it frees up time for this.

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.430
But it's also going to
be a social imperative

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:43.560
that it happens.

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.805
If you rewind a
few hundred years--

00:02:45.805 --> 00:02:47.180
and actually, you
don't even have

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:51.950
to rewind that far--
the bulk of society

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:55.260
was kind of involved in,
I'll call it physical labor.

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:03.890
You had a smaller fraction that
was involved in mental labor.

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:09.190
So I'll call this mental labor,
sometimes white collar jobs.

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:12.630
Something like filling out your
taxes, that is mental labor.

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:14.990
And you had a very small
percentage of society--

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:17.750
so this is kind of
historically, and I'm even

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:20.940
overstating what it is-- a very
small percentage of society

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:24.220
spent in kind of
innovation, creativity,

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:26.030
art, things like that.

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:30.930
So art, innovation,
true science,

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:34.420
true pushing the frontiers
of the human experience

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:36.730
and human understanding forward.

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:38.680
Now, as you get more
and more technology,

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:40.930
technology, especially with
the Industrial Revolution,

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:43.810
started to automate
a lot of this.

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:45.890
And it also made the pie bigger.

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:49.080
And so when you have kind of
an industrial society, what

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:52.780
happened is the necessity
for physical labor went down.

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:55.250
So you had a smaller
percentage of the population

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:57.240
that needed to do
physical labor.

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:00.190
The mental labor actually
grew, so more people

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:03.810
can now be involved in
things like mental labor.

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:06.390
And obviously, even automation
is handling some of that

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:09.550
as well, but you've freed up
more people to do mental labor.

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:12.150
And you've definitely
freed up a good bit more

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:16.450
of resources and people that
can now do the frontier,

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:20.430
pushing the envelope, the art,
the innovation, the creativity.

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:23.750
Now, if we fast-forward
to the year 2060,

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:26.310
I think this is going to
become an extreme form, where

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:29.520
almost no physical labor
is necessarily required.

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:31.930
People might like to
do it for exercise.

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:35.980
So this part right over here
is going to be very, very, very

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:37.890
small, especially in
developed countries.

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:41.140
And hopefully by 2060, most
countries will be developed.

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:44.690
Even the mental labor is going
to be taken over more and more

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:45.970
by automation.

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:47.980
So a lot of this is
going to be automated.

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:50.000
So you're going to
need less people

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.090
doing traditional mental labor
tasks-- filling out paperwork,

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:56.392
filling out your taxes,
things like that.

00:04:56.392 --> 00:04:58.100
And it's going to free
up a lot of wealth

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:00.570
and a lot of resources and
a lot of people's hours

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:04.380
to do truly artful,
creative, innovative things.

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:07.970
And so the bulk of society,
I think, by 2060, if things

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:10.720
go well, will be
over here, will be

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:12.300
in this kind of creative class.

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:14.830
This is where most
people will sit.

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:17.280
So it's actually an imperative
that our classrooms--

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:20.000
one, the tools are happening
to make it possible,

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.220
to make it feasible.

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:23.950
But not only that, but it's an
imperative if society really

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:25.500
is moving in this
direction-- and I

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:28.530
think it is-- so that we have
as many people as possible that

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:30.590
can do this research
and development,

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:33.890
that can do truly
creative activity.

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:36.507
Now, a corollary to this
idea that the classroom will

00:05:36.507 --> 00:05:39.090
be different, that people will
be working self-paced-- they'll

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:41.930
be spending a lot more
time working on projects--

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:44.590
is that instead of
our credentials being,

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:48.020
for the most part, seat-time
based-- so right now,

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:51.390
our credentials-- and
it's not 100% seat-time.

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:53.910
But to a large
degree, most people

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:57.130
spend 12-- actually, 13
years in K through 12.

00:05:57.130 --> 00:05:58.829
So that's 13 years.

00:05:58.829 --> 00:06:00.370
And then if you get
a college degree,

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:04.290
it's expected it's going
to be another four years.

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:05.730
And there are some
people who are

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:07.782
able to tweak this, skip
a grade here or there.

00:06:07.782 --> 00:06:09.490
But for the most part,
the bulk of people

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:11.680
do 13 years and then four years.

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:14.040
And then what the variable
is is how well you actually

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:18.160
achieved-- how well you actually
understood the material.

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:22.860
So the variable-- so this
thing is relatively fixed,

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:25.040
and then the variable is
your level of achievement.

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:31.920
Forgot an E, achievement.

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:34.380
And this right over
here is variable.

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:37.259
So some people go through
the system with straight A's.

00:06:37.259 --> 00:06:38.800
They've really
understood everything,

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:40.980
or hopefully they've understood
everything if they got straight

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:41.530
A's.

00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:42.580
Some people have B's.

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:43.817
Some people get C's.

00:06:43.817 --> 00:06:46.400
And that's why we have something
called a grade point average.

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:48.910
It shows that variation
in achievement,

00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:51.824
even though everyone is kind
of in this fixed seat-time.

00:06:51.824 --> 00:06:53.240
What we're going
to transition to,

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:55.830
especially once everyone is
learning at their own pace--

00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:58.150
they don't have to kind
of move together lockstep

00:06:58.150 --> 00:06:59.940
in these classrooms--
is you're going

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:05.940
to go to an
achievement-based model

00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:08.630
where there are achievements
that you are trying to get to,

00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:10.660
and they can be multiple things.

00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:12.310
Part of the
achievements could be

00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:21.080
skills like maybe calculus
or being able to read music

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:25.970
or being able to, I don't know,
understand quantum physics.

00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:28.480
These would all be
achievements, but you

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:33.530
decide how you will learn to
master these core concepts.

00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:36.590
So it won't be based on you
have to spend 13 years and then

00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:38.840
four years going
into debt to do it.

00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:40.832
You could go to a
formal institution

00:07:40.832 --> 00:07:42.290
to learn some of
this stuff, or you

00:07:42.290 --> 00:07:43.730
could learn it
however you see fit.

00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:45.813
You might be able to be
an apprentice with someone

00:07:45.813 --> 00:07:48.112
and then eventually
show that you

00:07:48.112 --> 00:07:49.940
know quantum physics very well.

00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:51.690
And I can imagine these
achievements would

00:07:51.690 --> 00:07:54.467
be far more rigorous
than the assessments that

00:07:54.467 --> 00:07:55.550
are being given right now.

00:07:55.550 --> 00:07:57.260
They could be oral examinations.

00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:58.830
They could be
practical examinations.

00:07:58.830 --> 00:08:01.160
They could be contingent
upon you building or applying

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:02.850
some of this information.

00:08:02.850 --> 00:08:06.160
But what's interesting about
this is now the seat-time,

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:09.030
the time is variable.

00:08:09.030 --> 00:08:09.780
Let me write this.

00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:13.350
The time is now the variable.

00:08:13.350 --> 00:08:15.540
You can do this whenever,
wherever, however long it

00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:16.040
takes.

00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:18.260
You could even revisit
things when you're 40 or 50.

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:20.560
There won't be any
artificial stopping point,

00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:21.244
that you are 22.

00:08:21.244 --> 00:08:22.160
You're a college grad.

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:24.400
Now you will not learn
new things anymore.

00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:26.400
And what's fixed-- and
I won't call it fixed,

00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:28.650
because you can always get
more and more achievements.

00:08:28.650 --> 00:08:31.140
But the achievements will
be at a high standard.

00:08:31.140 --> 00:08:32.990
It's a fixed high standard.

00:08:32.990 --> 00:08:35.710
So that if you get this
reading music achievement,

00:08:35.710 --> 00:08:37.611
you really do know
how to read music,

00:08:37.611 --> 00:08:39.610
which is different than
some other achievements.

00:08:39.610 --> 00:08:41.289
If I get a C in
a calculus class,

00:08:41.289 --> 00:08:43.655
it's not clear that I actually
do understand calculus.

00:08:43.655 --> 00:08:45.280
In fact, it's not
even necessarily true

00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:46.760
if I got an A in
a calculus class

00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:49.060
whether I definitely
understand calculus.

00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:53.567
So fixed high standards.

00:08:53.567 --> 00:08:55.650
And I imagine that the
only credentials won't just

00:08:55.650 --> 00:08:58.350
be these kind of
subject-based credentials.

00:08:58.350 --> 00:09:00.290
The most important
part-- because remember,

00:09:00.290 --> 00:09:03.080
the emphasis here is on the
creative, on the projects.

00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:05.770
And in creative fields,
your real transcript

00:09:05.770 --> 00:09:06.840
is not your GPA.

00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:09.070
Your real transcript
is your portfolio

00:09:09.070 --> 00:09:12.050
of projects, portfolio
of work that you've done.

00:09:12.050 --> 00:09:13.530
So people will get
things like this

00:09:13.530 --> 00:09:17.000
to show that they
understand specific domains,

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.490
but the most important part of
the transcript of the future

00:09:20.490 --> 00:09:23.600
will be people's
achievements-- or I

00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:24.730
should say, their projects.

00:09:24.730 --> 00:09:31.600
So maybe I made a robot that can
maybe make toast of some kind.

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:35.310
Maybe I've painted a
picture, so here's a picture.

00:09:35.310 --> 00:09:37.050
Maybe I've written
a piece of software

00:09:37.050 --> 00:09:40.240
that does something
interesting, so some software.

00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:43.390
So what employers and other
people will really care about

00:09:43.390 --> 00:09:45.880
isn't just your GPA
or how much time you

00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:46.920
spent in a lecture hall.

00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:49.570
They'll say, show me the
stuff that you have actually

00:09:49.570 --> 00:09:54.711
built, that shows that you are
really in this creative class,

00:09:54.711 --> 00:09:56.460
that you can start
from scratch and create

00:09:56.460 --> 00:09:58.145
something new and novel.

00:09:58.145 --> 00:09:59.520
And I also imagine,
because we'll

00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:02.010
be getting so much data
while people are actually

00:10:02.010 --> 00:10:05.640
working on getting some
of their core skills,

00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:08.330
that you won't just even have
these, do you know calculus?

00:10:08.330 --> 00:10:09.590
Do you know quantum physics?

00:10:09.590 --> 00:10:12.670
You'll also have metrics,
how hard working were you?

00:10:12.670 --> 00:10:14.760
How well did you
persevere, especially maybe

00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:16.360
when you failed first?

00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:19.132
These would be, I think,
considered to be good things.

00:10:19.132 --> 00:10:20.590
And on top of that,
you could start

00:10:20.590 --> 00:10:23.420
to measure, how well
did you help others?

00:10:23.420 --> 00:10:26.960
So that could be another
achievement, helping others.

00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:30.050
When you virtually tutor people
or physically tutor people,

00:10:30.050 --> 00:10:30.680
they rate you.

00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:32.390
And they say, wow, that
person really did help me.

00:10:32.390 --> 00:10:34.080
And we can even look
at the data to see

00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:37.710
whether you had a statistically
significant impact

00:10:37.710 --> 00:10:39.410
on their results.

00:10:39.410 --> 00:10:41.950
Now, the next corollary with
this different classroom

00:10:41.950 --> 00:10:43.470
and this
achievement-based learning

00:10:43.470 --> 00:10:45.030
is I think the
role of the teacher

00:10:45.030 --> 00:10:46.290
will change dramatically.

00:10:46.290 --> 00:10:48.590
And I think it'll be
in a very powerful way.

00:10:48.590 --> 00:10:53.470
So the role of the teacher,
rather than being a lecturer

00:10:53.470 --> 00:10:55.860
and often giving similar
lectures from year to year

00:10:55.860 --> 00:10:57.750
and always going
at the same pace,

00:10:57.750 --> 00:11:00.060
the teacher will now
be a coach or a mentor.

00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:02.610
And anyone who's ever seen a
great football or basketball

00:11:02.610 --> 00:11:05.190
coach will tell you that
a great coach or a mentor

00:11:05.190 --> 00:11:09.120
is a very rich and
important role,

00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:11.280
and so I think that
the role of the teacher

00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:14.820
will go up dramatically.

00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:17.820
And it actually won't even be
an isolated profession anymore.

00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:19.820
Right now, in a
traditional classroom,

00:11:19.820 --> 00:11:22.815
because it's lecture-based,
you have a classroom of 20,

00:11:22.815 --> 00:11:25.450
25, 30 students,
another classroom of 20,

00:11:25.450 --> 00:11:28.270
25, 30 students,
another classroom of 20,

00:11:28.270 --> 00:11:30.040
25, 30 students.

00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:34.830
And in each of them,
you'll have a teacher,

00:11:34.830 --> 00:11:36.600
often at the front
of the classroom,

00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:39.170
running class,
lecturing in some way.

00:11:39.170 --> 00:11:41.420
Because every student is now
working at their own pace

00:11:41.420 --> 00:11:43.169
at their own time and
the teachers are now

00:11:43.169 --> 00:11:45.940
spending most of their time
interacting with students,

00:11:45.940 --> 00:11:47.780
I could imagine a
world where, why

00:11:47.780 --> 00:11:49.590
have these walls
between classrooms?

00:11:49.590 --> 00:11:52.200
Why not just have
one larger classroom?

00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:54.980
Now it's 70, 75, 90 students.

00:11:54.980 --> 00:11:58.870
And all three teachers
work together.

00:11:58.870 --> 00:12:01.990
And so the teachers aren't
isolated in their rooms.

00:12:01.990 --> 00:12:05.160
They're all able to tag team and
play to each other's strengths.

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:07.340
And the students will
have the benefit-- instead

00:12:07.340 --> 00:12:11.410
of having the benefit of
one, I guess, experience

00:12:11.410 --> 00:12:13.220
base and knowledge
set, the students

00:12:13.220 --> 00:12:16.210
have the experience base
of all of these teachers.

00:12:16.210 --> 00:12:18.730
And not only that, they'll
also be tutoring each other.

00:12:18.730 --> 00:12:21.490
So in this model, it's
all going from the teacher

00:12:21.490 --> 00:12:23.990
to the student.

00:12:23.990 --> 00:12:28.050
Here, it's going from
teachers to multiple students

00:12:28.050 --> 00:12:30.990
and from students to students
and maybe even students

00:12:30.990 --> 00:12:32.190
to teachers.

00:12:32.190 --> 00:12:36.190
So it's going from peer to
peer and multiple teachers

00:12:36.190 --> 00:12:37.620
to multiple peers.

00:12:37.620 --> 00:12:39.290
And I think in this
type of a model--

00:12:39.290 --> 00:12:41.873
because the teacher's going to
become that much more valuable,

00:12:41.873 --> 00:12:44.110
because now it is
all interactive.

00:12:44.110 --> 00:12:45.680
There is no more
passive lecture.

00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:48.180
There is no giving the
same lecture every year.

00:12:48.180 --> 00:12:51.530
I think that the
profession of teaching

00:12:51.530 --> 00:12:53.550
will become even
more prestigious.

00:12:53.550 --> 00:12:56.892
So my big-- and I'm
saying 2060, but I

00:12:56.892 --> 00:12:59.350
think this is going to happen
over the next 10 to 15 years.

00:12:59.350 --> 00:13:02.350
So I think by 2020
or 2025 you're

00:13:02.350 --> 00:13:04.100
going to have-- the
teaching profession is

00:13:04.100 --> 00:13:08.350
going to become at parity
with professions like medicine

00:13:08.350 --> 00:13:11.180
or law or engineering in
terms of how much of a teacher

00:13:11.180 --> 00:13:14.040
can make and how they
are valued by society.

00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:16.680
So I predict in this
reality teachers, based

00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:18.550
on today's money if you
inflation-adjust it,

00:13:18.550 --> 00:13:23.122
are going to make $150,000
to $200,000 per year.

00:13:23.122 --> 00:13:24.580
And for any of
those who say, wait,

00:13:24.580 --> 00:13:28.470
where's the money for
$150,000 to $200,000 per year,

00:13:28.470 --> 00:13:30.770
you just should realize
that right now most states--

00:13:30.770 --> 00:13:32.550
even if you just focus
on public schools--

00:13:32.550 --> 00:13:38.400
are spending on the order
of $10,000 a student.

00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:41.340
And even if you had a 25 to
one student to teacher ratio,

00:13:41.340 --> 00:13:44.870
that means that you have--
so if you multiply it

00:13:44.870 --> 00:13:51.380
by 25 students, that means you
have $250,000 for the teacher

00:13:51.380 --> 00:13:54.030
and the facilities and
any other technology.

00:13:54.030 --> 00:13:56.970
And all I'm arguing
for is that the master

00:13:56.970 --> 00:13:58.840
teachers, the ones
that are really

00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:00.770
pushing the envelope
here, should

00:14:00.770 --> 00:14:02.910
get a bulk of these
resources, as opposed

00:14:02.910 --> 00:14:06.360
to layers of bureaucracy
and whatever else.

00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:08.166
Now, the last prediction
I'll make related

00:14:08.166 --> 00:14:09.790
to education right
over here-- and it's

00:14:09.790 --> 00:14:13.720
related to all of this--
is because the actual cost

00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:15.500
of delivering a lot
of the core material,

00:14:15.500 --> 00:14:17.880
a lot of the core
practice, over here

00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:20.960
is going to go close to zero,
because you'll really just need

00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:24.357
an internet connection and
maybe your peers who are also

00:14:24.357 --> 00:14:25.440
learning alongside of you.

00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:27.200
And it'll become
even better if you

00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:29.890
have a really
amazing, experienced,

00:14:29.890 --> 00:14:31.650
professional teacher with you.

00:14:31.650 --> 00:14:35.210
But the fourth part
of it is I believe

00:14:35.210 --> 00:14:38.940
we're going to get to a
99% global literacy rate,

00:14:38.940 --> 00:14:42.070
and we're already close to this
in much of the developed world.

00:14:42.070 --> 00:14:44.980
But in the developing world,
it's significantly below this.

00:14:44.980 --> 00:14:46.650
And obviously, you
can imagine if we

00:14:46.650 --> 00:14:48.810
do get to this type
of a literacy rate

00:14:48.810 --> 00:14:52.832
what that means for health care,
what that means for population,

00:14:52.832 --> 00:14:54.540
what that means for
economic growth, what

00:14:54.540 --> 00:14:55.400
that means for wars.

00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:59.060
I think this is a very,
very, very positive thing.

00:14:59.060 --> 00:15:02.380
And coinciding with this idea
that students around the world

00:15:02.380 --> 00:15:05.360
are able to get access to
a world-class education,

00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:09.530
that it's like having clean
drinking water or electricity,

00:15:09.530 --> 00:15:13.570
I think you start getting closer
to a global meritocracy, where

00:15:13.570 --> 00:15:16.250
that student who, right
now she might just

00:15:16.250 --> 00:15:19.830
be the daughter of beggars
in some part of the developed

00:15:19.830 --> 00:15:22.510
world, but because she has
access to this material

00:15:22.510 --> 00:15:25.260
and she can develop herself--
and people will know how she's

00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:27.940
developing herself, because all
the data is being logged-- we

00:15:27.940 --> 00:15:30.540
can say, wow, she
has the potential

00:15:30.540 --> 00:15:33.740
to really be one of the
leaders in this creative class.

00:15:33.740 --> 00:15:37.270
She has the potential to
find the cure for cancer

00:15:37.270 --> 00:15:40.460
or find a new way
of doing X, Y, or Z.

00:15:40.460 --> 00:15:45.880
And so you really can give these
students all over the world

00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:48.630
the opportunities that
they really should have.

00:15:48.630 --> 00:15:50.950
And hopefully there will
be a ton of opportunities,

00:15:50.950 --> 00:15:53.560
because the pie will have
gotten so much bigger that we

00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:57.430
can support a lot of
these creative endeavors.
