00:00:03.769 --> 00:00:07.529
Someday a grandpa is going to be listening
to 2 Chainz and telling his friends that those

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:15.070
damn kids keep leaving notes on his tumblr.

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:18.360
It's going to happen!

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:20.040
But is it a bad thing?

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:25.370
Earth's population is aging, In 1970, the
average woman on Earth birthed 4.7 children,

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:28.420
by 2011 it was down to 2 point 5.

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:31.010
We're getting older, fast.

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:34.840
Some humans think it's a terrible thing, while
others think it's great!

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:35.840
Why the discrepancy?

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:37.430
A bunch of reasons.

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:41.940
Worries about adequate health care, economic
shortfalls, pension burdens, and the concern

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.480
with the youths taking over… dang kids…

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:49.079
I feel like I've read a million-and-a-half
Gen-X or Baby Boomer penned articles complaining

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:55.079
how Millennials are horrible pampered narcissists,
and another million blog features on how the

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.730
Olds are unoriginal, corporate, luddites,
who don't see the world is changing.

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:02.940
This isn't going to be either of those, because
science.

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:08.150
A study was released recently in Plos One
exploring the idea of an aging population

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:12.329
from the angles of productivity, environmentalism,
wealth, and wellbeing.

00:01:12.329 --> 00:01:16.049
Looking at Germany's aging population, the
researchers from the Max Planck Institute

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:22.090
and the University of Washington found an
aging population can actually be a GOOD thing!

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:25.530
Researchers chose Germany because it's the
second oldest population in the world (after

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.079
Japan), with a median age of 44.3 years.

00:01:29.079 --> 00:01:34.259
They found older populations can cause INCREASED
productivity, and are usually more financially

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.139
stable, which is good for the economy.

00:01:36.139 --> 00:01:40.619
Plus, those Pop-pops and Nana's are able to
share that wealth with their children as they

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:41.619
age.

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:45.180
In a country like Germany, where health care
is socialized, the researchers project older

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.889
people will stay healthier longer, allowing
them to contribute to society; this will keep

00:01:49.889 --> 00:01:53.950
them in a better Quality of Life too -- allowing
more leisure time.

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:59.799
By 2050, the average German man will spend
80-percent of his life in good health (17-percent

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:03.579
longer than today), live longer, and be happier.

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:06.170
Another big one, is the impact on the environment.

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:12.080
An older population will use fewer energy-intensive
goods and a decreasing population will mean

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:13.570
lower carbon emissions.

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:18.630
Older people living in cities encourages better
urban planning, more walking and ease of access.

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:22.760
It's great for childcare also, because grandma
and grandpa can help take care of children

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:23.760
too!

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.540
There ARE negatives though, let's not pretend
there aren't.

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:29.040
Older folks' bodies are more vulnerable to
breakage, they adapt more slowly to major

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:34.530
environmental shifts -- like a natural disaster
-- and are generally more likely to fall ill.

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.060
All hope is not lost!

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:39.880
Kids from this year's Google Science Fair
are coming up with fantastic inventions and

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:43.470
ideas to keep those cotton tops integrated
with everyone else.

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.620
Some of the projects create prosthetics for
improving movement, like the eye-movement-controlled

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:52.930
wheelchair, or speech, like the breath-to-speech
monitor invented by a 16-year-old from India.

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:56.870
There's even a health monitor that can help
a caregiver track their old friend as they

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:01.380
move in and out of bed, especially helpful
for senior communities or families.

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:07.650
In the end, getting older is going to happen
to us all, so I'm looking forward to the exoskeletons,

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:12.370
replaceable organs and cool technologies coming
out of experiments like these and the promise

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:13.940
of a healthy, aging population.

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:18.670
Just goes to show that clever innovations
can come from anywhere - including the U.S.

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:19.670
Air Force!

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:22.200
I wanna take a moment to thank them for supporting
DNews.

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.950
The U.S. Air Force is always breaking barriers
and using science and technology to push the

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:27.450
limits of what's possible.

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:32.710
They were the first to break the sound barrier
in 1947, and they're still pushing today.

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:34.240
Are you excited to get old?

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:35.240
Or are you dreading it?

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:36.610
Are you OLD ALREADY?!

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:46.310
Tell us your wisdom!!
