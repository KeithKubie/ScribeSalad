00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:04.370
Mary wants the fraction
of pink blocks in model B

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:07.530
to be equivalent to the fraction
of pink blocks in model A.

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:10.090
How many blocks in
model B need to be pink

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:11.420
in order to make that happen?

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:12.930
So let's look at model A.

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:14.640
So how many equal
sections are there?

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:18.390
There's 1, 2, 3, 4,
5 equal sections.

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.390
There are 5 equal sections.

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:22.730
And what fraction
of them are pink?

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:26.440
Well, you have one
of them is pink.

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:28.070
One of the blocks is pink.

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:34.175
So 1/5 of the blocks over
here in model A is pink.

00:00:34.175 --> 00:00:35.800
Now, we have to think
about how to make

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.420
1/5 pink right over here.

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:39.420
So let's think about it.

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.540
So how many, first of all,
total blocks are there?

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:43.673
There's 1, 2, 3--
let me actually

00:00:43.673 --> 00:00:44.960
do this in another color.

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:52.824
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,
11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17,

00:00:52.824 --> 00:00:54.890
18, 19, 20.

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:59.042
There are 20 total blocks here.

00:00:59.042 --> 00:01:01.000
And you see that this is
the exact same length.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.900
Model B is the exact
same length as model A.

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:06.540
And so for every
block that you have

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.040
in model A, for
every block here,

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:13.655
you must have 4 in model B
because we went from 5 sections

00:01:13.655 --> 00:01:15.280
to 20.

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.050
So we're essentially
multiplying by 4.

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:18.091
And you even see it here.

00:01:18.091 --> 00:01:20.810
If we were to just
draw a line right down

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:25.050
here you see, you see for
every block in model A,

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:28.940
you have 1, 2, 3, 4
blocks in model B.

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:31.980
So one block in
model A that is pink

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:35.700
would be the same thing
as 4 blocks in model B.

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.890
We would literally just
multiply this times 4.

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:47.850
So 4 of the 20 will need to
be made pink, so 1, 2, 3, 4.

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.380
And you see that it
exactly matches up.

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:55.069
This is the exact same fraction
of the entire model over here.

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:56.860
So when they say how
many blocks in model B

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:58.950
need to be pink to
make that happen?

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.940
It would be 4.
