00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.250
ASIA SEAVERS:
Rachael Ray is here.

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:10.876
Welcome Emmy award winning
talk show host, Rachael Ray.

00:00:10.876 --> 00:00:11.376
Woo.

00:00:11.376 --> 00:00:12.334
RACHAEL RAY: Hey, guys.

00:00:12.334 --> 00:00:15.322
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:15.322 --> 00:00:16.780
ASIA SEAVERS: Well,
hello, Rachael.

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:17.710
RACHAEL RAY: Well, hello.

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:18.970
ASIA SEAVERS: How are
you today, darling?

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:19.886
RACHAEL RAY: I'm good.

00:00:19.886 --> 00:00:21.070
It's low humidity.

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:21.690
I like that.

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:22.160
ASIA SEAVERS: Great.

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:23.368
RACHAEL RAY: Yeah, it's good.

00:00:23.368 --> 00:00:25.270
ASIA SEAVERS: Frizz
Control yes, thank you.

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:26.444
So oh, wow.

00:00:26.444 --> 00:00:28.110
I didn't know that
was reading up there.

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:28.600
That's awesome.

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:29.020
OK, cool.

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:30.520
RACHAEL RAY: You
don't have to read.

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:31.472
I answer anything.

00:00:31.472 --> 00:00:32.680
ASIA SEAVERS: That's awesome.

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:34.600
Well, we have a couple
of things going on

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.629
for you in the next
couple days, couple weeks.

00:00:37.629 --> 00:00:38.670
"Rachael Ray," your show.

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.030
RACHAEL RAY: Promises, promises.

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:41.680
ASIA SEAVERS: Tell
me about your show,

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:43.087
your 12th season coming up.

00:00:43.087 --> 00:00:44.920
RACHAEL RAY: Yeah, 12
is a big thing for me.

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:46.330
I got married 12 years ago.

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:48.140
I adopted my pit
bull 12 years ago.

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:50.080
We launched the
magazine 12 years ago

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:52.630
and the daytime talk show.

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:56.597
So knock on wood,
they're all still here.

00:00:56.597 --> 00:00:57.430
ASIA SEAVERS: Right.

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:58.340
RACHAEL RAY: Going well.

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.670
ASIA SEAVERS: 12's [INAUDIBLE].

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:01.630
RACHAEL RAY: I remain gainfully
employed and the dog is good.

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:03.830
She's home with John.

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:06.421
It's Monday, so he's probably
having a lovely afternoon

00:01:06.421 --> 00:01:06.920
scotch.

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:08.706
He usually takes Monday off, so.

00:01:08.706 --> 00:01:10.580
ASIA SEAVERS: 12, OK,
what's your dog's name?

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:11.090
I do not know.

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.590
RACHAEL RAY: Isaboo.

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:12.720
ASIA SEAVERS:
Isaboo, oh, my gosh.

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.428
RACHAEL RAY: Isabella
is my favorite name

00:01:14.428 --> 00:01:16.720
and I don't have time
to have human children.

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:20.420
And my first pit bull was
named Boo and when she passed,

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:22.472
I got Isaboo because
she had bindi dot

00:01:22.472 --> 00:01:23.930
right in the middle
of her forehead

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:26.070
and she looked very
similar to her.

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.524
So I combined the two
names and named her Isaboo.

00:01:28.524 --> 00:01:30.440
ASIA SEAVERS: Isaboo,
go Isaboo, whoop, whoop.

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:36.020
OK, what was something that
really influenced the trend

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.177
of your show, "Rachael Ray"?

00:01:38.177 --> 00:01:40.010
RACHAEL RAY: I think
our show didn't set out

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:43.460
to be like anything
else of its kind.

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:45.890
Our show, we love
having celebrities

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:48.854
on but when they come on, we
like them to do a longer format

00:01:48.854 --> 00:01:50.270
and let people get
to know them as

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:52.760
if they were their next
door neighbors rather

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:54.009
than celebrities.

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:56.300
So they can bring a clip of
whatever and plug whatever,

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:59.210
but we try and have a little
more next door neighbor

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:00.920
kind of time with them.

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.690
And our show is not
celebrity-dependent.

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:04.730
So we try and make
sure that people

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:07.460
see as much of
themselves on our show

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:10.759
as they do celebrities or
politicians or athletes

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:15.180
or people that they see
as celebrities or famous.

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.690
And I think that's a
fun promise, you know?

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:19.670
Because you never get
the same show twice.

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:22.190
At the very least,
hopefully, we make you hungry

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:24.060
and want to make dinner.

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.440
Look, the concept of the show,
the concept of our business

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:31.370
model as a brand is that
good life should not be

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:33.710
for rich or privileged people.

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:36.080
Life should be
adventurous and feel good

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:40.260
and feel fun, not just on
weekends or when you retire.

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.260
But whether it's
talking to strangers,

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.250
taking a left instead of right,
taking small vacations instead

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:48.800
of saving up for one big one,
making something different

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:53.270
for dinner, we want people
to have fun every day

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.860
they're alive.

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:57.769
So the show has very
small goals but we want

00:02:57.769 --> 00:02:59.060
to reach those goals every day.

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:03.036
We just want people to have
fun and learn something.

00:03:03.036 --> 00:03:04.070
Something huge?

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:05.000
No.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.550
Maybe a recipe, maybe
a tip, maybe a trick,

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:09.866
maybe they learn something
about a celebrity

00:03:09.866 --> 00:03:11.240
when we do have
them on that they

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:12.950
wouldn't see someplace else.

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:14.930
We like it to be a
friendly space where

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:17.240
everybody feels that they
can conquer what they see.

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.630
ASIA SEAVERS: Yeah.

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:20.088
RACHAEL RAY: It's another thing
that's very important to me

00:03:20.088 --> 00:03:24.620
as a producer, a
writer, a presenter.

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:27.200
I want people to feel that
they have access to everything

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:27.800
that they see.

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:31.850
So we let people see
messes and successes.

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:34.802
We are not scripted, which is
wildly evident if you watch.

00:03:34.802 --> 00:03:36.010
ASIA SEAVERS: That's amazing.

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:38.180
RACHAEL RAY: So,
you know, we want

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:41.750
people to feel comfortable
and not intimidated

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:43.240
to try anything they see.

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:45.440
And we want them to be a
little bit inspired to just

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:46.440
have a little bit more fun.

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:47.231
ASIA SEAVERS: Yeah.

00:03:47.231 --> 00:03:49.220
Now, with you having
celebrities on your show,

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:51.740
is there a celebrity that
you've ever been starstruck

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:52.640
by where you're just like, oh--

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:54.848
RACHAEL RAY: My first crush
when I was a little girl,

00:03:54.848 --> 00:03:57.140
and the only thing I
would put a dress on for,

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:58.422
was the "Tom Jones Show."

00:03:58.422 --> 00:03:59.130
ASIA SEAVERS: Oh!

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:01.546
RACHAEL RAY: So the first time
Tom Jones came on the show,

00:04:01.546 --> 00:04:03.746
I had a very difficult
time looking at him, yes.

00:04:03.746 --> 00:04:04.870
ASIA SEAVERS: That's crazy.

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:06.735
I would have been
like, [GASPS] hi.

00:04:06.735 --> 00:04:08.430
RACHAEL RAY: I mean, there's
a million huge moments.

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:08.720
I mean--

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:09.511
ASIA SEAVERS: Yeah.

00:04:09.511 --> 00:04:12.360
RACHAEL RAY: I never
thought I'd have

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:14.442
any sort of life in
television or hanging out

00:04:14.442 --> 00:04:15.150
with celebrities.

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:17.339
So I mean, some of
my favorites are--

00:04:17.339 --> 00:04:19.200
the most optimistic
person on the planet

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:21.149
to me is Michael J. Fox.

00:04:21.149 --> 00:04:23.340
You know, the first time
he was ever on the show

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:24.900
overwhelmed me.

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:27.984
And he slow danced with me
to that song from the show

00:04:27.984 --> 00:04:30.150
when he fell in love with
Tracy, his real-life wife.

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:31.550
Yeah, I know!

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:31.690
ASIA SEAVERS: That's amazing.

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:33.330
RACHAEL RAY: And he used to
get-- that guy was great.

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:35.610
The first day we launched
our children's initiative,

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:38.070
I can't believe that
was 10 years ago,

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:41.010
but President Clinton was there
and he partnered the Alliance

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:44.949
for a Healthier Generation
with our little upstart.

00:04:44.949 --> 00:04:46.740
There's a lot of
important days on my show.

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:47.823
ASIA SEAVERS: That's good.

00:04:47.823 --> 00:04:50.540
RACHAEL RAY: You know,
I think every day,

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:53.240
as I said, what's most important
to me is that-- every day,

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:57.320
we shoot three shows on
most days, taping our show.

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:59.390
What's important to
me is that I'm always

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:01.310
surprised by how
many shows don't have

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:05.930
a celebrity or a star
athlete or a politician

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:08.794
and then when you're like, wow,
the audience really loved that.

00:05:08.794 --> 00:05:11.210
And it's just people watching
each other and sharing ideas

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:12.510
with each other.

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:16.219
Those are some of my favorites
from that arena of my life.

00:05:16.219 --> 00:05:18.260
ASIA SEAVERS: Now, with
the clip we just watched,

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.930
it seems like you have
so much fun on set.

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:22.640
What is the funniest
thing that's

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:24.890
ever happened to you on set?

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:28.040
RACHAEL RAY: I mean, it
depends, know what I mean?

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:29.090
It's all funny, you know?

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:33.050
When Regis sets himself
on fire, it's funny.

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:35.180
When I cut myself
on air, it's usually

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:36.530
pretty funny for people.

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:37.640
I mean, we just--

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:41.330
I just like that people see
that, we don't clean things up

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:42.320
or--

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:45.020
what I'm upset about is
how much we over edit.

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:49.740
We take out-- when Denis Leary
and I are sitting together,

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:51.950
there's a lot of heavy
editing that goes down.

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:55.880
But it's more because of
our language with each other

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:56.750
than the content.

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:59.210
But, you know, I don't know.

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:03.010
I think we always have,
hopefully, a good time.

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:05.030
Every day should be
fun for everybody.

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:06.950
ASIA SEAVERS: That's so good.

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:08.690
Now, with your first--

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:11.201
I remember watching "Rachael
Ray" a while back and it

00:06:11.201 --> 00:06:13.200
was cooking, cooking,
cooking, cooking, cooking,

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:14.060
and so much cooking and--

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:15.140
RACHAEL RAY: Well,
I was on 30 minute--

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:17.890
I've been on Food Network
for 20 years, 19 years, so--

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:18.350
ASIA SEAVERS: That's amazing.

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:18.950
RACHAEL RAY: --yeah, of course.

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:20.000
ASIA SEAVERS: Now,
was the transition

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.190
tough to come from cooking
shows to doing interviews?

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:23.390
RACHAEL RAY: No, it
wasn't my idea at all.

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:23.600
ASIA SEAVERS: Oh.

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:25.440
RACHAEL RAY: My
friend, Brooke Johnson,

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:27.504
who ran a Food
Network at the time,

00:06:27.504 --> 00:06:29.420
she said, you know, you
should do a talk show.

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:32.097
I said, well, I'm under
contract with you guys.

00:06:32.097 --> 00:06:32.930
It's not, you know--

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:34.555
ASIA SEAVERS: You
got to figure it out.

00:06:34.555 --> 00:06:35.910
RACHAEL RAY: Uh, no.

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:41.270
So we've always been partners
with Scripps and CBS,

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:43.490
of course, and our
little company.

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:45.530
And then Oprah became
a part of the process

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:46.850
and invited me on her show.

00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:50.375
And I mean, once
you're on Oprah--

00:06:50.375 --> 00:06:51.500
ASIA SEAVERS: You're there.

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:52.180
RACHAEL RAY: --you're in.

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:53.590
ASIA SEAVERS: You're in there.

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:56.532
RACHAEL RAY: You
know, so it was just

00:06:56.532 --> 00:06:57.740
a weird set of circumstances.

00:06:57.740 --> 00:06:59.180
It wasn't part of the plan.

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:01.057
It just sort of
organically happened.

00:07:01.057 --> 00:07:03.140
ASIA SEAVERS: Now, you
have another show coming up

00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:05.280
that's premiered, "Worst
Cooks in America."

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:07.940
RACHAEL RAY: Oh, that's work
that I do for Food Network

00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:11.710
and I do that project especially
for my friend, Anne Burrell.

00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:15.077
I love Anne, so I'm kind of
a sucker for any friend who

00:07:15.077 --> 00:07:16.160
says, please come do this.

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:17.930
That is a very hard show to do.

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:19.867
Yeah, it's been on
all summer, I think.

00:07:19.867 --> 00:07:21.950
It's probably coming towards
the end of its cycle.

00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:25.310
But "Worst Cooks" really
is one of the worst jobs

00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:26.810
to have because the
days are so long

00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:28.268
and you really
torture these people

00:07:28.268 --> 00:07:30.800
and they really do
suck in the kitchen.

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:32.420
So it's hard.

00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:34.890
It's like watching children
play in traffic, you know?

00:07:34.890 --> 00:07:35.270
ASIA SEAVERS: Oh, no.

00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:36.340
RACHAEL RAY: It's
like, here's people

00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:38.000
who don't know how
to turn on stoves

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:39.740
and they're playing
with knives and fire.

00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:40.374
And you know--

00:07:40.374 --> 00:07:42.290
ASIA SEAVERS: And the
model for that is people

00:07:42.290 --> 00:07:43.770
bring in their dishes.

00:07:43.770 --> 00:07:45.000
And do try the dishes?

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:46.000
Do you taste the dishes?

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:46.850
RACHAEL RAY: Oh,
we're supposed to.

00:07:46.850 --> 00:07:49.070
But since I work very
little for Food Network,

00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:51.945
I feel perfectly free to
say, I'm not eating that.

00:07:51.945 --> 00:07:53.320
ASIA SEAVERS: No,
this is not OK.

00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:54.490
RACHAEL RAY: And
it is Anne's show.

00:07:54.490 --> 00:07:55.760
Anne's kind of the same.

00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:57.980
Anne's like, yeah,
I'm not going there.

00:07:57.980 --> 00:08:00.740
The worst of the
worst that we ever had

00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:04.190
was a very sweet man, older man
trying to learn a new trick.

00:08:04.190 --> 00:08:05.120
That's great.

00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:07.400
He cooked for us
and he put together

00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:10.760
a jar of mayonnaise, three
or four cans of tuna,

00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:14.092
and a jar of raspberry
preserves and then baked it

00:08:14.092 --> 00:08:15.550
with American cheese
slices on top.

00:08:15.550 --> 00:08:16.420
ASIA SEAVERS: No.

00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:16.920
No.

00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:19.270
RACHAEL RAY: In a loaf pan.

00:08:19.270 --> 00:08:20.102
ASIA SEAVERS: No.

00:08:20.102 --> 00:08:22.310
RACHAEL RAY: There's no
freaking way I'm eating that.

00:08:22.310 --> 00:08:23.690
I mean, of course not.

00:08:23.690 --> 00:08:25.130
ASIA SEAVERS: Does anyone
actually try them, though?

00:08:25.130 --> 00:08:25.630
Do people actually--

00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:27.213
RACHAEL RAY: Oh,
Anne and I try a lot.

00:08:27.213 --> 00:08:29.540
We've had a lot of really
horrible, awful stuff.

00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:31.280
But you know,
everybody's heart is

00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:32.767
in the right place
and the reason

00:08:32.767 --> 00:08:34.850
I do this show is that
it's very important to Anne

00:08:34.850 --> 00:08:38.476
to really teach people and
get them excited about it.

00:08:38.476 --> 00:08:40.559
And the reason I do it is
not only because of Anne

00:08:40.559 --> 00:08:43.159
but because I think it changes
the quality of your life

00:08:43.159 --> 00:08:45.470
to be able to provide food
for yourself and people

00:08:45.470 --> 00:08:47.180
that you care about,
whether you're

00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:49.610
a rocket scientist or
you cook for a living.

00:08:49.610 --> 00:08:52.719
It changes the day-to-day
quality of your life.

00:08:52.719 --> 00:08:54.260
ASIA SEAVERS: Yeah,
that's very true.

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:57.020
And even what you said about
cooking for people you love.

00:08:57.020 --> 00:08:59.250
You have a pet food line.

00:08:59.250 --> 00:09:02.000
RACHAEL RAY: I started that
because several years ago,

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:07.260
a lot of American
animals, dogs and cats,

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:10.070
were literally being poisoned
by their loved ones unknowingly

00:09:10.070 --> 00:09:11.990
and unwittingly
because there were so

00:09:11.990 --> 00:09:15.440
many fillers in the foods
that were being imported

00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:17.780
and there was no
regulation of it.

00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:21.932
We've always had, since day
one of the magazine, a pet food

00:09:21.932 --> 00:09:24.140
column if you want to cook
something for your animal.

00:09:24.140 --> 00:09:26.510
But to be honest,
it's hard for people

00:09:26.510 --> 00:09:28.310
to find time to
cook for themselves.

00:09:28.310 --> 00:09:30.110
It's not realistic people are
going to cook for their pets

00:09:30.110 --> 00:09:30.860
every single day.

00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:36.500
So we started a line
with an American company.

00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:39.050
At the time, it
was called Dad's.

00:09:39.050 --> 00:09:40.760
Ainsworth is the
name of the company.

00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:43.340
And they were lovely
people and they

00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:47.660
agreed to make this
food, two recipes based

00:09:47.660 --> 00:09:50.630
on what I would write
for the magazine,

00:09:50.630 --> 00:09:52.070
and to the highest of standards.

00:09:52.070 --> 00:09:58.062
I have eaten the kibble and
the cat food, wet cat food.

00:09:58.062 --> 00:09:59.520
Needs a little salt
but it's tasty.

00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:00.870
But I eat it on
television all the time

00:10:00.870 --> 00:10:02.570
to prove to people
that it's delicious--

00:10:02.570 --> 00:10:02.950
ASIA SEAVERS: Edible.

00:10:02.950 --> 00:10:05.116
RACHAEL RAY: --and I can,
of course that it's tasty.

00:10:05.116 --> 00:10:08.020
But because that brand's
been very successful,

00:10:08.020 --> 00:10:10.080
we've raised and
given away I think

00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:11.460
we may be over $17 million now.

00:10:11.460 --> 00:10:13.260
Because we were at $16 million.

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:16.905
And then we gave $1
million to Harvey,

00:10:16.905 --> 00:10:19.130
to animal victims of that--

00:10:19.130 --> 00:10:20.130
ASIA SEAVERS: Hurricane.

00:10:20.130 --> 00:10:21.088
RACHAEL RAY: --tragedy.

00:10:21.088 --> 00:10:23.234
So I think now we're
over $17 million.

00:10:23.234 --> 00:10:24.900
But it's because the
brand is successful

00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:28.950
and it's doing well for animals
that have special allergies,

00:10:28.950 --> 00:10:30.990
elderly dogs.

00:10:30.990 --> 00:10:34.170
We've really had great
luck with that brand

00:10:34.170 --> 00:10:36.065
and it serves its purpose.

00:10:36.065 --> 00:10:37.440
One of the most
important lessons

00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:42.090
I think I learned over the
last 19 years of my life

00:10:42.090 --> 00:10:44.220
and building this brand
and building the business

00:10:44.220 --> 00:10:48.840
is you can make business models
to fund anything you want.

00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:52.050
It shouldn't just be about
what you can collect and get.

00:10:52.050 --> 00:10:54.390
If you become
successful in business,

00:10:54.390 --> 00:10:56.700
you can make a model,
large or small,

00:10:56.700 --> 00:10:57.929
to fund whatever you want.

00:10:57.929 --> 00:10:58.720
ASIA SEAVERS: Yeah.

00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:01.350
RACHAEL RAY: So we
send kids to school.

00:11:01.350 --> 00:11:02.460
We improve school food.

00:11:02.460 --> 00:11:05.610
We feed hungry
American children,

00:11:05.610 --> 00:11:07.650
that was our first
initiative Yum-O.

00:11:07.650 --> 00:11:09.900
We used that as the
model for Nutrish.

00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:12.769
That's how we fund
animals, animal rescue.

00:11:12.769 --> 00:11:14.310
And we don't just
save dogs and cats.

00:11:14.310 --> 00:11:16.530
We save horses and
llamas and goats

00:11:16.530 --> 00:11:20.790
and all kinds of non-kill
facilities, large and small.

00:11:20.790 --> 00:11:23.010
ASIA SEAVERS: Oh,
that's so amazing.

00:11:23.010 --> 00:11:24.960
Entering the pet
food market, what

00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:27.540
was probably the
most surprising thing

00:11:27.540 --> 00:11:31.122
to learn about the
actual pet food market?

00:11:31.122 --> 00:11:32.330
RACHAEL RAY: Nothing, really.

00:11:32.330 --> 00:11:35.740
I mean, once you give people a
fair price and a great product,

00:11:35.740 --> 00:11:37.396
it's a--

00:11:37.396 --> 00:11:39.270
you know, I never look
at business like that.

00:11:39.270 --> 00:11:43.280
I try and think of what I
want in a product or a thing.

00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:44.310
I design furniture.

00:11:44.310 --> 00:11:45.330
I design pots.

00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:48.990
I certainly produce
and program television.

00:11:48.990 --> 00:11:53.160
I write recipes, religiously,
tons of them every single day.

00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:56.490
And I try and figure out
how to serve my customer

00:11:56.490 --> 00:11:58.380
and what's not being done yet.

00:11:58.380 --> 00:12:01.169
I never think about,
what do I have to learn

00:12:01.169 --> 00:12:02.460
about this genre or that genre.

00:12:02.460 --> 00:12:05.760
I try and come up with,
as a consumer or customer

00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:08.670
myself, what do I think's
missing out there.

00:12:08.670 --> 00:12:10.080
And that's my head space.

00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:10.430
ASIA SEAVERS: Yeah.

00:12:10.430 --> 00:12:12.679
RACHAEL RAY: I don't study
what the other guy's doing.

00:12:12.679 --> 00:12:13.750
I don't really care.

00:12:13.750 --> 00:12:15.810
I wish them all the
success in the world.

00:12:15.810 --> 00:12:18.393
I want to come up with something
that feels comfortable for me

00:12:18.393 --> 00:12:20.760
and the people I work with
and our style and our way.

00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:23.264
And if that doesn't work,
we move along and came up

00:12:23.264 --> 00:12:24.180
with the new solution.

00:12:24.180 --> 00:12:25.740
And if it does work, great.

00:12:25.740 --> 00:12:28.560
We try and nurture that
thing and let it grow.

00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:30.960
We are not a group
of people that

00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:34.560
goes to work thinking about the
next guy or the competition.

00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:37.512
We go to work to problem solve
and to work for each other,

00:12:37.512 --> 00:12:38.970
to give each other
something that's

00:12:38.970 --> 00:12:40.920
a solution for a small problem.

00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:41.890
ASIA SEAVERS: Wow.

00:12:41.890 --> 00:12:43.770
Now, have you ever
cooked for your pets?

00:12:43.770 --> 00:12:44.920
Do you make dinner
for your pets often?

00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:45.090
RACHAEL RAY: Always.

00:12:45.090 --> 00:12:45.850
ASIA SEAVERS: Oh, how often?

00:12:45.850 --> 00:12:46.990
RACHAEL RAY: Always.

00:12:46.990 --> 00:12:48.210
Always, every day.

00:12:48.210 --> 00:12:51.099
I mean, Izzy also
likes her dry food

00:12:51.099 --> 00:12:52.890
and there's always some
kibble in the bowl.

00:12:52.890 --> 00:12:54.690
But Izzy's a very weird dog.

00:12:54.690 --> 00:12:57.840
She only eats when she's
truly, truly hungry.

00:12:57.840 --> 00:13:01.650
I can't tell you how many times
my husband comes home from--

00:13:01.650 --> 00:13:05.100
he does these dinners with
his friends once every month

00:13:05.100 --> 00:13:08.640
or every other month,
steak and men night.

00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:10.620
It's mostly scotch
and men night but they

00:13:10.620 --> 00:13:12.840
eat a little bit of
steak and he brings home

00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:14.370
Peter Luger or something.

00:13:14.370 --> 00:13:15.540
She will walk away from it.

00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:15.810
ASIA SEAVERS: Oh.

00:13:15.810 --> 00:13:16.530
RACHAEL RAY: If
she's not hungry,

00:13:16.530 --> 00:13:17.970
she doesn't want any part of it.

00:13:17.970 --> 00:13:18.240
ASIA SEAVERS: It's a good--

00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:20.490
RACHAEL RAY: She's a very,
very, very, very picky dog,

00:13:20.490 --> 00:13:21.307
very picky eater.

00:13:21.307 --> 00:13:22.890
But yeah, I cook for
her all the time.

00:13:22.890 --> 00:13:23.970
I love to cook.

00:13:23.970 --> 00:13:25.410
ASIA SEAVERS: That's amazing.

00:13:25.410 --> 00:13:27.930
When I think about pet
food, I'm like, oh, my gosh,

00:13:27.930 --> 00:13:30.470
if I don't eat it then
why should my pet eat it?

00:13:30.470 --> 00:13:30.810
And that's literally what--

00:13:30.810 --> 00:13:31.530
RACHAEL RAY: Well
that's the point--

00:13:31.530 --> 00:13:32.160
ASIA SEAVERS: --your brand is.

00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:32.900
RACHAEL RAY: --behind our food.

00:13:32.900 --> 00:13:33.320
ASIA SEAVERS: Yeah.

00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:34.194
RACHAEL RAY: Exactly.

00:13:34.194 --> 00:13:36.124
If I wouldn't feed
it to people, why

00:13:36.124 --> 00:13:37.290
would I give it to someone--

00:13:37.290 --> 00:13:37.640
ASIA SEAVERS: Exactly.

00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:40.181
RACHAEL RAY: --or to something
that's as important in my life

00:13:40.181 --> 00:13:40.800
as humans?

00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:41.716
ASIA SEAVERS: Exactly.

00:13:41.716 --> 00:13:43.980
Now, with the whole Google
food module-- as you know,

00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:46.109
Google is a tech
company, whoop, whoop.

00:13:46.109 --> 00:13:48.150
RACHAEL RAY: Yeah, but
you also got a lot of food

00:13:48.150 --> 00:13:48.650
in this place.

00:13:48.650 --> 00:13:48.960
ASIA SEAVERS: Exactly.

00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:49.590
RACHAEL RAY: In
this one building,

00:13:49.590 --> 00:13:51.420
y'all have eight restaurants.

00:13:51.420 --> 00:13:52.620
ASIA SEAVERS: Yes, exactly.

00:13:52.620 --> 00:13:54.240
So what do you
think the next food

00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:57.510
trend is with technology
and food merging together?

00:13:57.510 --> 00:14:01.770
RACHAEL RAY: You know, I think
that food, as in everything,

00:14:01.770 --> 00:14:06.600
because of Google, access to
information, because of the way

00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:09.510
people are so connected
now and anyone can go up

00:14:09.510 --> 00:14:13.980
on YouTube and share
stop motion quick videos

00:14:13.980 --> 00:14:16.260
and how they made this
or that and people

00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:19.170
are educating themselves in what
they eat and why they eat it

00:14:19.170 --> 00:14:23.220
and how they eat it, I
think that it opens up

00:14:23.220 --> 00:14:25.380
lots of doors and
possibilities for everyone,

00:14:25.380 --> 00:14:27.390
for people just starting
out in the business,

00:14:27.390 --> 00:14:30.570
for people that want to continue
to educate themselves or build

00:14:30.570 --> 00:14:32.050
their customer base.

00:14:32.050 --> 00:14:33.922
I think it's great.

00:14:33.922 --> 00:14:35.380
I mean, people ask
me all the time,

00:14:35.380 --> 00:14:37.430
what do you think about the meal
kits and the meal deliveries?

00:14:37.430 --> 00:14:39.660
I'm like, listen, anything
gets you into the kitchen,

00:14:39.660 --> 00:14:41.159
sooner or later, I
hope you'll learn

00:14:41.159 --> 00:14:43.920
how to do it for yourself,
because it of course

00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:46.027
costs you less money and
you have the byproduct.

00:14:46.027 --> 00:14:48.110
You don't have to cook out
of these little pouches

00:14:48.110 --> 00:14:50.835
and they send you
three pea pods.

00:14:50.835 --> 00:14:52.530
But I think it's
terrific if people

00:14:52.530 --> 00:14:56.580
need that as the thing that gets
them started or down that line.

00:14:56.580 --> 00:14:58.449
I think it's great.

00:14:58.449 --> 00:15:00.990
ASIA SEAVERS: Do you see your
self in the mobile applications

00:15:00.990 --> 00:15:01.620
market?

00:15:01.620 --> 00:15:03.000
We have so many markets--

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.700
RACHAEL RAY: Only as much as I
see the smart people around me

00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:09.695
trying to push me into that.

00:15:09.695 --> 00:15:11.820
I mean, is it something
that I'm naturally good at?

00:15:11.820 --> 00:15:12.319
No.

00:15:12.319 --> 00:15:14.730
Do we have a lot of really
educated people around me

00:15:14.730 --> 00:15:17.640
that will bring us there?

00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:19.000
Sure, I hope.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:19.910
ASIA SEAVERS: Yeah.

00:15:19.910 --> 00:15:22.110
Now, how do you find the
balance between eating

00:15:22.110 --> 00:15:24.277
healthy and just comfort food?

00:15:24.277 --> 00:15:25.110
I love comfort food.

00:15:25.110 --> 00:15:25.680
You love comfort food.

00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:26.855
RACHAEL RAY: That
one drives me nuts.

00:15:26.855 --> 00:15:27.130
ASIA SEAVERS: Right?

00:15:27.130 --> 00:15:29.129
RACHAEL RAY: I think that
word is such bullshit.

00:15:29.129 --> 00:15:30.390
I just do.

00:15:30.390 --> 00:15:34.410
I am not a person that likes
to live balanced anything.

00:15:34.410 --> 00:15:35.520
I eat colorful food.

00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:36.270
ASIA SEAVERS: Yes.

00:15:36.270 --> 00:15:38.590
RACHAEL RAY: I cook
with largely olive oil.

00:15:38.590 --> 00:15:40.760
I've never felt
guilt about food.

00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:42.520
I am not--

00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:44.240
I eat what I feel like eating.

00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:49.230
But actually, most people that
cook for a living or that work

00:15:49.230 --> 00:15:51.810
in the service industry,
what makes us happy

00:15:51.810 --> 00:15:53.700
is to make the person
we're serving happy.

00:15:53.700 --> 00:15:57.930
So all we want to cook is
whatever the person sitting

00:15:57.930 --> 00:15:59.110
with us wants to eat.

00:15:59.110 --> 00:15:59.943
ASIA SEAVERS: Right.

00:15:59.943 --> 00:16:01.520
RACHAEL RAY: We're
not picky at all.

00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:03.312
We'll literally eat anything.

00:16:03.312 --> 00:16:04.770
When I was a kid
and Judy Blume had

00:16:04.770 --> 00:16:06.270
the book "How to
Eat Fried Worms,"

00:16:06.270 --> 00:16:08.450
I was the kid that would
eat the worm for $1.

00:16:08.450 --> 00:16:09.390
ASIA SEAVERS: What?

00:16:09.390 --> 00:16:11.240
RACHAEL RAY: I really
can eat anything.

00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:13.980
I'm happy with just
scrambled eggs.

00:16:13.980 --> 00:16:17.380
But it's not something I
give, really, a thought to.

00:16:17.380 --> 00:16:20.130
And I never give a thought
to balance about my life.

00:16:20.130 --> 00:16:22.680
I can cook all day and do three
shows and get home at 8:00.

00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:23.640
We always make dinner.

00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:23.970
ASIA SEAVERS: Yeah.

00:16:23.970 --> 00:16:25.620
RACHAEL RAY: I
prefer to be at home.

00:16:25.620 --> 00:16:31.440
I prefer to go there, put my
Spamalot slippers and Jets

00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:33.790
slippers on, get in the
kitchen, open some wine,

00:16:33.790 --> 00:16:35.717
and make our dinner.

00:16:35.717 --> 00:16:37.050
And that's the way I was raised.

00:16:37.050 --> 00:16:39.150
My mother worked 80
to 100 hours a week.

00:16:39.150 --> 00:16:43.180
My grandfather before her was
my best friend when I was a kid.

00:16:43.180 --> 00:16:44.306
He worked 100 hours a week.

00:16:44.306 --> 00:16:46.596
He'd get his kids out of bed
in the middle of the night

00:16:46.596 --> 00:16:48.110
so he could sing
arias to them they

00:16:48.110 --> 00:16:50.110
could watch the northern lights.

00:16:50.110 --> 00:16:51.672
It's about your quality of life.

00:16:51.672 --> 00:16:52.630
It's not about balance.

00:16:52.630 --> 00:16:53.421
ASIA SEAVERS: Yeah.

00:16:53.421 --> 00:16:56.020
RACHAEL RAY: That word
kind of is like getting hit

00:16:56.020 --> 00:16:57.730
with a shock or something.

00:16:57.730 --> 00:16:59.140
It shouldn't be about balance.

00:16:59.140 --> 00:17:00.820
If you love your
job, you should love

00:17:00.820 --> 00:17:03.430
doing it a lot of the time.

00:17:03.430 --> 00:17:06.579
If you care about enjoying
the time you're home,

00:17:06.579 --> 00:17:09.190
you should care enough to
stay up a little later,

00:17:09.190 --> 00:17:11.470
pull out a pan, make
some food for yourself

00:17:11.470 --> 00:17:14.750
because it feeds your soul,
not just your stomach.

00:17:14.750 --> 00:17:18.149
It's more about the quality
for me than the balance thing.

00:17:18.149 --> 00:17:18.940
ASIA SEAVERS: Yeah.

00:17:18.940 --> 00:17:21.150
Now, with the quality, I
know that your shopping list

00:17:21.150 --> 00:17:23.394
is probably insane every week.

00:17:23.394 --> 00:17:25.540
[LAUGHS] Sorry.

00:17:25.540 --> 00:17:27.099
RACHAEL RAY: This is such--

00:17:27.099 --> 00:17:28.690
people find this
so freaky about me.

00:17:28.690 --> 00:17:30.520
ASIA SEAVERS: Uh-huh.

00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:34.330
RACHAEL RAY: My friend Emily
made me this wrapping paper

00:17:34.330 --> 00:17:35.720
of all of my grocery lists.

00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:36.120
She went in and--

00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:36.350
ASIA SEAVERS: What?

00:17:36.350 --> 00:17:38.183
RACHAEL RAY: --photographed
them because she

00:17:38.183 --> 00:17:39.240
thinks they're so nuts.

00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:40.990
And now whenever I
give a gift to someone,

00:17:40.990 --> 00:17:42.531
I don't even have
to put a card on it

00:17:42.531 --> 00:17:45.460
because they know because it's
wrapped in my grocery lists.

00:17:45.460 --> 00:17:47.644
Yeah, I'm a nutty,
nutty list maker.

00:17:47.644 --> 00:17:49.810
I don't know if I believe
in horoscopes or whatever,

00:17:49.810 --> 00:17:52.090
but I am a Virgo and
that's supposed to be

00:17:52.090 --> 00:17:53.380
people love to make lists.

00:17:53.380 --> 00:17:54.255
ASIA SEAVERS: Virgos.

00:17:54.255 --> 00:17:55.934
RACHAEL RAY: And I'm--

00:17:55.934 --> 00:17:57.100
ASIA SEAVERS: A listed out--

00:17:57.100 --> 00:17:57.803
RACHAEL RAY: I'm nuts.

00:17:57.803 --> 00:17:58.216
ASIA SEAVERS: Yeah.

00:17:58.216 --> 00:17:58.966
RACHAEL RAY: Yeah.

00:17:58.966 --> 00:18:00.910
So every year, we take--

00:18:00.910 --> 00:18:05.110
a group of our friends,
primarily musicians and cooks,

00:18:05.110 --> 00:18:07.774
we did, for 10 years,
take 100 people every year

00:18:07.774 --> 00:18:09.940
to the scene of the crime
where my husband and I got

00:18:09.940 --> 00:18:11.200
married in Italy.

00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:13.579
It's the only ridiculous
expenditure in my life,

00:18:13.579 --> 00:18:16.120
otherwise I live in sweatpants
and I'm down at the "Tar-jay."

00:18:16.120 --> 00:18:19.390
but we would, every
year for 10 years,

00:18:19.390 --> 00:18:23.557
take all of our friends and most
of our family to Italy with us

00:18:23.557 --> 00:18:25.390
and just party for the
whole weekend, right?

00:18:25.390 --> 00:18:26.140
ASIA SEAVERS: I'm
now your family.

00:18:26.140 --> 00:18:27.060
RACHAEL RAY: Yeah.

00:18:27.060 --> 00:18:31.610
Now, that castle, the guy who
owns it, he moved back in.

00:18:31.610 --> 00:18:33.262
So now it's a much
smaller thing.

00:18:33.262 --> 00:18:33.970
ASIA SEAVERS: OK.

00:18:33.970 --> 00:18:37.160
RACHAEL RAY: And we have
like 30, 35 of us go to Italy

00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:39.010
and they're all
cooks or musicians.

00:18:39.010 --> 00:18:42.172
And I go there and I cook
for two of the nights.

00:18:42.172 --> 00:18:42.880
ASIA SEAVERS: OK.

00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:45.639
RACHAEL RAY: And our friends
jump in and make extra dishes

00:18:45.639 --> 00:18:46.430
to go on the table.

00:18:46.430 --> 00:18:49.580
But I basically just live in the
kitchen for all of it, right?

00:18:49.580 --> 00:18:53.140
So the list I just finished--
this is coming up next week--

00:18:53.140 --> 00:18:56.360
the list I just finished
over this weekend,

00:18:56.360 --> 00:19:02.170
it is 16 handwritten pages
of equipment, the groceries,

00:19:02.170 --> 00:19:05.470
every single checklist
of everything possible.

00:19:05.470 --> 00:19:06.329
It's 16 pages.

00:19:06.329 --> 00:19:07.120
ASIA SEAVERS: What?

00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:09.270
RACHAEL RAY: [LAUGHS]
I took a photograph

00:19:09.270 --> 00:19:10.210
and sent it to Italy.

00:19:10.210 --> 00:19:12.010
I call my friend
Giancarlo at the place.

00:19:12.010 --> 00:19:13.550
I'm like, are you ready?

00:19:13.550 --> 00:19:14.710
Let's go through the list.

00:19:14.710 --> 00:19:15.055
ASIA SEAVERS: We're
going to do it.

00:19:15.055 --> 00:19:16.260
RACHAEL RAY: And she's
like, oh, my god.

00:19:16.260 --> 00:19:18.520
Yeah, 2 and 1/2 hours on
the phone to go through it.

00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:20.295
Yeah, I'm a nutter.

00:19:20.295 --> 00:19:22.420
And then I get there and
of course I change my mind

00:19:22.420 --> 00:19:24.220
when I get to the market or
I see this or I see that.

00:19:24.220 --> 00:19:25.844
But I do that for my
family every week.

00:19:25.844 --> 00:19:28.630
I cook for my mom.

00:19:28.630 --> 00:19:30.760
Usually every other
weekend we go upstate.

00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:32.350
I'm from the Adirondacks.

00:19:32.350 --> 00:19:35.060
And I try and plan out
every menu seasonally.

00:19:35.060 --> 00:19:37.660
I'll get up before work and go
to Union Square Greenmarket.

00:19:37.660 --> 00:19:40.610
What I can't find, I'll
order through the kitchens

00:19:40.610 --> 00:19:42.160
at the show or my
husband will go

00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:43.240
to Garden of Eden or something.

00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:43.690
But--

00:19:43.690 --> 00:19:45.550
ASIA SEAVERS: So that's
the 16-page game plan.

00:19:45.550 --> 00:19:46.360
You're like, divvy it up.

00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:47.943
RACHAEL RAY: Next
week is 16 to pages.

00:19:47.943 --> 00:19:50.314
Usually for the weekend,
it's only two to four.

00:19:50.314 --> 00:19:51.250
ASIA SEAVERS: What?

00:19:51.250 --> 00:19:53.460
So what is your game plan when
you go in the grocery store?

00:19:53.460 --> 00:19:55.001
Is it like produce
last, this first--

00:19:55.001 --> 00:19:57.950
RACHAEL RAY: Well, I rarely
go to grocery store or grocery

00:19:57.950 --> 00:19:58.450
stores.

00:19:58.450 --> 00:20:00.820
I go to-- I'm very lucky in
that when I'm in the city,

00:20:00.820 --> 00:20:04.070
I go to Union Square Greenmarket
for most of the season.

00:20:04.070 --> 00:20:06.660
And then I can also
order stuff at the show

00:20:06.660 --> 00:20:09.746
and tack it into orders
that are coming in, right?

00:20:09.746 --> 00:20:10.740
ASIA SEAVERS: Yeah.

00:20:10.740 --> 00:20:12.823
RACHAEL RAY: And I love
to shop in Chelsea Market.

00:20:12.823 --> 00:20:16.360
There's a lobster place
and Buon Italia, I love.

00:20:16.360 --> 00:20:19.780
So I kind of piecemeal it and
I put together my game plan.

00:20:19.780 --> 00:20:21.670
But then when I
get to the market,

00:20:21.670 --> 00:20:24.440
I also say, oh, yeah, we should
do a whole roast cauliflower,

00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:24.940
too.

00:20:24.940 --> 00:20:25.649
ASIA SEAVERS: Oh.

00:20:25.649 --> 00:20:27.273
RACHAEL RAY: I have
a thumbnail sketch,

00:20:27.273 --> 00:20:29.110
but when I get there,
I mean, generally, I

00:20:29.110 --> 00:20:31.630
cook like every person
who cooks for a living.

00:20:31.630 --> 00:20:34.060
You cook seasonally and what
you know is going to be there

00:20:34.060 --> 00:20:37.150
and what's going to look
good and have the best price.

00:20:37.150 --> 00:20:39.839
But you always change it up a
little bit or mystery box it

00:20:39.839 --> 00:20:40.630
when you get there.

00:20:40.630 --> 00:20:43.180
If I was teaching people how
to shop, which I do often

00:20:43.180 --> 00:20:45.670
on our show, you
go into the store,

00:20:45.670 --> 00:20:47.950
you should always take a
look at the loss leaders.

00:20:47.950 --> 00:20:49.790
There's a loss leader
in every department.

00:20:49.790 --> 00:20:51.332
Buy that, whatever
it is, even if you

00:20:51.332 --> 00:20:52.498
don't want to get that week.

00:20:52.498 --> 00:20:53.530
Put it in your freezer.

00:20:53.530 --> 00:20:55.900
Always shop low and high,
never in the middle.

00:20:55.900 --> 00:20:57.010
Those are the best prices.

00:20:57.010 --> 00:20:59.890
Always buy per unit of
measure, not the price that's

00:20:59.890 --> 00:21:01.920
ticketed on the item,
so on and so forth.

00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:02.920
ASIA SEAVERS: Thank you.

00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:04.050
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:04.050 --> 00:21:05.430
You just saved so
much of my life

00:21:05.430 --> 00:21:07.240
right now because I'm just
like, middle aisle, whatever

00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:09.120
I can reach, I'm just like,
OK, you go in the cart.

00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:10.940
RACHAEL RAY: Yeah, you're
wasting a lot of money.

00:21:10.940 --> 00:21:11.610
ASIA SEAVERS: Apparently.

00:21:11.610 --> 00:21:12.340
RACHAEL RAY: And
you got to learn

00:21:12.340 --> 00:21:13.510
how to break down a chicken.

00:21:13.510 --> 00:21:15.130
You've got to learn how to buy--

00:21:15.130 --> 00:21:16.330
ASIA SEAVERS: My mom
taught me that last week.

00:21:16.330 --> 00:21:17.740
She's like, we're doing this.

00:21:17.740 --> 00:21:18.400
RACHAEL RAY: You've
got to learn it.

00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:18.980
ASIA SEAVERS: You want gloves?

00:21:18.980 --> 00:21:20.320
RACHAEL RAY: If you know
how to break down a chicken,

00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:20.945
you know a lot.

00:21:20.945 --> 00:21:21.944
ASIA SEAVERS: Thank you.

00:21:21.944 --> 00:21:24.000
RACHAEL RAY: And it
saves you a lot of money.

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:24.700
ASIA SEAVERS: A
lot of-- it does.

00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:24.940
RACHAEL RAY: A lot of money.

00:21:24.940 --> 00:21:25.750
ASIA SEAVERS: And
then you can freeze it

00:21:25.750 --> 00:21:26.690
and just have it for next--

00:21:26.690 --> 00:21:26.950
RACHAEL RAY: That's right.

00:21:26.950 --> 00:21:28.360
ASIA SEAVERS: I was
like, thanks, Mom.

00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:28.830
RACHAEL RAY: I know.

00:21:28.830 --> 00:21:29.300
ASIA SEAVERS: Make
it [INAUDIBLE]

00:21:29.300 --> 00:21:29.770
RACHAEL RAY: Isn't that fun?

00:21:29.770 --> 00:21:30.936
ASIA SEAVERS: It's so great.

00:21:30.936 --> 00:21:31.650
Oh, my gosh.

00:21:31.650 --> 00:21:33.250
Now, what influenced
all of this?

00:21:33.250 --> 00:21:35.740
What inspired you to get into
cooking and start teaching?

00:21:35.740 --> 00:21:38.530
RACHAEL RAY: I mean,
just luck of the draw.

00:21:38.530 --> 00:21:40.240
My mother is one of 10 children.

00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:41.930
My grandfather was one of 16.

00:21:41.930 --> 00:21:42.850
14 lived.

00:21:42.850 --> 00:21:44.380
The four youngest came here.

00:21:44.380 --> 00:21:46.720
My mother was his
firstborn so she was always

00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:48.510
in the kitchen with my grandpa.

00:21:48.510 --> 00:21:50.510
My grandpa was my best
friend when I was little.

00:21:50.510 --> 00:21:53.247
My mom worked in
restaurants for 55 years.

00:21:53.247 --> 00:21:55.580
And she didn't trust other
people to watch her children,

00:21:55.580 --> 00:21:58.240
so we were largely with her.

00:21:58.240 --> 00:21:59.560
All of us learned how to cook.

00:21:59.560 --> 00:22:01.120
I have one brother, one sister.

00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:03.690
I think because my mom was one
of 10, she stopped at three.

00:22:03.690 --> 00:22:04.398
ASIA SEAVERS: Oh.

00:22:04.398 --> 00:22:07.720
RACHAEL RAY: But it
just felt good to me.

00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:10.731
I like working in food.

00:22:10.731 --> 00:22:11.230
It's easy.

00:22:11.230 --> 00:22:12.220
You're always going
to have a gig.

00:22:12.220 --> 00:22:13.680
People will always be hungry.

00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:14.060
ASIA SEAVERS: Hungry.

00:22:14.060 --> 00:22:14.470
RACHAEL RAY: You
know what I mean?

00:22:14.470 --> 00:22:15.345
ASIA SEAVERS: Always.

00:22:15.345 --> 00:22:18.720
RACHAEL RAY: The rest of
it was ice cream or whipped

00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:19.630
cream on the cake.

00:22:19.630 --> 00:22:21.530
I don't eat sweets
but, you know,

00:22:21.530 --> 00:22:24.530
extra cheese on the spaghetti
was the other stuff.

00:22:24.530 --> 00:22:26.010
But I like working in food.

00:22:26.010 --> 00:22:27.820
There's great job security.

00:22:27.820 --> 00:22:30.924
It's very humbling and
empowering at the same time.

00:22:30.924 --> 00:22:32.840
I think everybody should
have to work in food.

00:22:32.840 --> 00:22:33.910
I don't care what you do.

00:22:33.910 --> 00:22:34.880
ASIA SEAVERS: It's
a good experience.

00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:35.510
It's a humbling experience.

00:22:35.510 --> 00:22:35.850
RACHAEL RAY: Sure is.

00:22:35.850 --> 00:22:36.940
ASIA SEAVERS: It
teaches you a lot.

00:22:36.940 --> 00:22:37.410
And you will never--

00:22:37.410 --> 00:22:38.826
RACHAEL RAY: Dish
machine operator

00:22:38.826 --> 00:22:40.120
will teach you a whole lot.

00:22:40.120 --> 00:22:41.100
ASIA SEAVERS: You were
a dish machine operator?

00:22:41.100 --> 00:22:43.130
RACHAEL RAY: Hell
yes, my first job.

00:22:43.130 --> 00:22:43.937
That's glamorous.

00:22:43.937 --> 00:22:44.770
ASIA SEAVERS: It is.

00:22:44.770 --> 00:22:45.420
It's fun.

00:22:45.420 --> 00:22:46.135
I think it would be fun.

00:22:46.135 --> 00:22:47.010
RACHAEL RAY: Oh, no,
it's not fun, sweetheart.

00:22:47.010 --> 00:22:47.800
ASIA SEAVERS: It's
hot, it's crazy.

00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:49.100
RACHAEL RAY: It's 120 degrees--

00:22:49.100 --> 00:22:49.690
ASIA SEAVERS: No.

00:22:49.690 --> 00:22:51.070
RACHAEL RAY: --all
day and you're

00:22:51.070 --> 00:22:55.295
one big sweaty nasty
piece of business.

00:22:55.295 --> 00:22:57.310
And at 14 or 15, that ain't fun.

00:22:57.310 --> 00:22:58.600
ASIA SEAVERS: It is not.

00:22:58.600 --> 00:23:00.200
RACHAEL RAY: That
ain't a cute look.

00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:03.272
ASIA SEAVERS: No, what is your
personal mission after you've

00:23:03.272 --> 00:23:05.230
got the luck of the draw,
you got through here,

00:23:05.230 --> 00:23:07.870
you've come up with these
different innovative ideas

00:23:07.870 --> 00:23:10.174
and cookware, cookbooks,
what is your next--

00:23:10.174 --> 00:23:11.590
RACHAEL RAY:
Furniture, too, yeah.

00:23:11.590 --> 00:23:12.010
ASIA SEAVERS: Furniture.

00:23:12.010 --> 00:23:13.060
RACHAEL RAY: I love
designing furniture.

00:23:13.060 --> 00:23:14.070
It's fun.

00:23:14.070 --> 00:23:16.150
Just to stay true to the brand.

00:23:16.150 --> 00:23:17.870
You can't be all
things to all people.

00:23:17.870 --> 00:23:21.460
You have to decide what you are
and who you are and work with

00:23:21.460 --> 00:23:23.680
and surround yourself
with people that

00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:26.340
are of like thinking, believe
in whatever your mantra

00:23:26.340 --> 00:23:28.870
or motto is.

00:23:28.870 --> 00:23:30.310
And then just be grateful.

00:23:30.310 --> 00:23:33.770
I like the feeling of
working as hard as possible.

00:23:33.770 --> 00:23:36.239
I like feeling that
I put in a full day.

00:23:36.239 --> 00:23:37.030
ASIA SEAVERS: Yeah.

00:23:37.030 --> 00:23:39.760
RACHAEL RAY: Whether
it's a day off or not,

00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:41.500
I have to be active, you know?

00:23:41.500 --> 00:23:42.760
ASIA SEAVERS: Yeah.

00:23:42.760 --> 00:23:46.089
RACHAEL RAY: And as long as
I'm true to that, I'm good.

00:23:46.089 --> 00:23:47.380
ASIA SEAVERS: That makes sense.

00:23:47.380 --> 00:23:49.135
To stay stagnant,
it's like, what am I--

00:23:49.135 --> 00:23:50.260
I think it's a Virgo thing.

00:23:50.260 --> 00:23:51.090
We're just like, we cannot--

00:23:51.090 --> 00:23:52.330
RACHAEL RAY: No,
I can't do that.

00:23:52.330 --> 00:23:53.150
I'm real bad at it.

00:23:53.150 --> 00:23:53.500
ASIA SEAVERS: Right.

00:23:53.500 --> 00:23:54.180
You have to keep--

00:23:54.180 --> 00:23:55.638
RACHAEL RAY: And
my husband's a Leo

00:23:55.638 --> 00:23:57.820
but he's a cusp-y
kind of a thing.

00:23:57.820 --> 00:24:03.760
Our birthdays are just a few
days apart and he's the same.

00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:06.010
We suck at doing nothing.

00:24:06.010 --> 00:24:07.609
It's really bad.

00:24:07.609 --> 00:24:09.650
He has to be in his studio
or I'm in the kitchen.

00:24:09.650 --> 00:24:12.970
And we have to be
working during the day.

00:24:12.970 --> 00:24:15.010
We're not good at just
being like, hey, let's

00:24:15.010 --> 00:24:16.300
watch nine movies in a row.

00:24:16.300 --> 00:24:16.720
ASIA SEAVERS: No.

00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:17.630
RACHAEL RAY: Although
that does happen.

00:24:17.630 --> 00:24:18.310
"Ozark" really--

00:24:18.310 --> 00:24:19.110
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:19.110 --> 00:24:20.380
I was like, oh, this is bad.

00:24:20.380 --> 00:24:20.960
ASIA SEAVERS: If it's good--

00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:23.126
RACHAEL RAY: I watched the
entire thing in 30 hours.

00:24:23.126 --> 00:24:24.602
I'm like, I might have an issue.

00:24:24.602 --> 00:24:26.560
ASIA SEAVERS: Binge
watching Netflix and chill.

00:24:26.560 --> 00:24:26.810
RACHAEL RAY: Mm-hmm.

00:24:26.810 --> 00:24:27.920
ASIA SEAVERS: Oh, yes.

00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:28.557
Now, what is--

00:24:28.557 --> 00:24:29.890
RACHAEL RAY: Or Apple or Amazon.

00:24:29.890 --> 00:24:31.330
I've been known to
do it on all of them.

00:24:31.330 --> 00:24:32.260
ASIA SEAVERS: All of them.

00:24:32.260 --> 00:24:32.620
RACHAEL RAY: I know.

00:24:32.620 --> 00:24:33.055
It's dangerous.

00:24:33.055 --> 00:24:33.835
That is dangerous.

00:24:33.835 --> 00:24:34.180
ASIA SEAVERS: It is.

00:24:34.180 --> 00:24:35.830
The on-demand TV
is really just--

00:24:35.830 --> 00:24:36.640
RACHAEL RAY: It is
really dangerous.

00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:37.931
ASIA SEAVERS: --devouring time.

00:24:37.931 --> 00:24:38.930
I'm like, yes, now.

00:24:38.930 --> 00:24:40.930
Now, what is the most
interesting thing

00:24:40.930 --> 00:24:43.930
we would learn from you
without watching your movie--

00:24:43.930 --> 00:24:46.297
watching your TV show,
books, or anything like that?

00:24:46.297 --> 00:24:48.130
What's the most interesting
thing we could--

00:24:48.130 --> 00:24:49.690
RACHAEL RAY: I don't know.

00:24:49.690 --> 00:24:51.230
I wait on people for a living.

00:24:51.230 --> 00:24:54.430
You can't ask somebody that does
what I do for a living, what's

00:24:54.430 --> 00:24:56.760
the coolest thing about you?

00:24:56.760 --> 00:24:57.352
I don't know.

00:24:57.352 --> 00:24:58.060
ASIA SEAVERS: OK.

00:24:58.060 --> 00:24:59.650
I think that it's
pretty cool, everything

00:24:59.650 --> 00:25:01.000
you're doing thus far, though.

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:01.480
It's pretty awesome.

00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:03.480
RACHAEL RAY: I mean, I like
to jump out of airplanes.

00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:03.820
That's fun.

00:25:03.820 --> 00:25:04.480
ASIA SEAVERS: That is--

00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:05.060
what?

00:25:05.060 --> 00:25:05.560
OK.

00:25:05.560 --> 00:25:05.680
RACHAEL RAY: Love it.

00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:06.430
ASIA SEAVERS: How
many times have you

00:25:06.430 --> 00:25:07.600
jumped out of an airplane?

00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:09.100
RACHAEL RAY: Four or five.

00:25:09.100 --> 00:25:09.650
ASIA SEAVERS: Where, were they--

00:25:09.650 --> 00:25:11.530
RACHAEL RAY: And I've been
shut down a couple times,

00:25:11.530 --> 00:25:12.738
because of winds or whatever.

00:25:12.738 --> 00:25:14.350
But yeah, I love it.

00:25:14.350 --> 00:25:16.565
I mean, it organizes my
brain in a strange way.

00:25:16.565 --> 00:25:18.190
It makes me very calm
for a few months.

00:25:18.190 --> 00:25:19.170
I love it.

00:25:19.170 --> 00:25:20.200
ASIA SEAVERS: Were they
all different heights

00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:21.110
are the same like--

00:25:21.110 --> 00:25:23.610
RACHAEL RAY: No, the flight
deck that we jump from,

00:25:23.610 --> 00:25:25.760
the sky ranch is 14,500.

00:25:25.760 --> 00:25:28.300
So it's like three miles.

00:25:28.300 --> 00:25:29.230
It's fun.

00:25:29.230 --> 00:25:30.814
It really is wildly
relaxing, I swear.

00:25:30.814 --> 00:25:33.104
ASIA SEAVERS: Did anyone else
hear three miles just out

00:25:33.104 --> 00:25:34.230
of the sky, just pew.

00:25:34.230 --> 00:25:35.896
RACHAEL RAY: You know
what's so funny is

00:25:35.896 --> 00:25:39.490
I am petrified of being
on a ladder over six feet.

00:25:39.490 --> 00:25:40.942
Short heights, I'm terrible at.

00:25:40.942 --> 00:25:41.650
ASIA SEAVERS: No.

00:25:41.650 --> 00:25:43.140
RACHAEL RAY: Jumping out
of an airplane, love it.

00:25:43.140 --> 00:25:43.984
ASIA SEAVERS: You
have time to think.

00:25:43.984 --> 00:25:44.830
RACHAEL RAY: Can't
get there fast enough.

00:25:44.830 --> 00:25:45.600
I love it.

00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:46.617
Oh, so fun.

00:25:46.617 --> 00:25:48.700
ASIA SEAVERS: I wanted to
go indoor skydiving just

00:25:48.700 --> 00:25:49.420
to be like, OK.

00:25:49.420 --> 00:25:50.420
RACHAEL RAY: That was harder.

00:25:50.420 --> 00:25:50.650
ASIA SEAVERS: What?

00:25:50.650 --> 00:25:52.420
RACHAEL RAY: I just
did that with friends.

00:25:52.420 --> 00:25:54.460
My girlfriends and I
were up in Montreal

00:25:54.460 --> 00:25:56.070
and we did one of
those tube things

00:25:56.070 --> 00:25:58.710
because it looks like so fun
and I'm like, ah, I got this.

00:25:58.710 --> 00:25:59.450
ASIA SEAVERS: Your
face is just like--

00:25:59.450 --> 00:26:00.671
RACHAEL RAY: Oh, it's horrible.

00:26:00.671 --> 00:26:02.650
It was so much more fun
jumping out of the real plane.

00:26:02.650 --> 00:26:04.000
ASIA SEAVERS: Real airplane, no.

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:04.570
Nuh-uh.

00:26:04.570 --> 00:26:05.800
I'm like, there's a ground.

00:26:05.800 --> 00:26:07.330
I might hit it
and I'm just flat.

00:26:07.330 --> 00:26:08.530
But at least there's air.

00:26:08.530 --> 00:26:09.710
You can slow down.

00:26:09.710 --> 00:26:12.430
RACHAEL RAY: Yeah, no, actually,
once you open the chute,

00:26:12.430 --> 00:26:14.192
it's so incredibly chill.

00:26:14.192 --> 00:26:16.150
You can totally stop your
body if you push down

00:26:16.150 --> 00:26:17.590
with both hands
at the same time.

00:26:17.590 --> 00:26:20.170
And you're just suspended
above the earth.

00:26:20.170 --> 00:26:22.410
You're not dropping at
all for several seconds.

00:26:22.410 --> 00:26:24.689
You're just there
and it's pin silent.

00:26:24.689 --> 00:26:25.230
It's so cool.

00:26:25.230 --> 00:26:26.500
It's very cool.

00:26:26.500 --> 00:26:27.749
That tube thing, not so cool.

00:26:27.749 --> 00:26:29.040
ASIA SEAVERS: It was just loud.

00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:30.400
RACHAEL RAY: Just looking
like bug or something

00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:31.600
in a hair dryer.

00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:32.925
It was really bad.

00:26:32.925 --> 00:26:34.570
ASIA SEAVERS: Is it
hot air, cold air?

00:26:34.570 --> 00:26:35.410
RACHAEL RAY: No,
it's just like--

00:26:35.410 --> 00:26:36.115
ASIA SEAVERS: Regular air.

00:26:36.115 --> 00:26:37.560
RACHAEL RAY: Right,
room temperature air.

00:26:37.560 --> 00:26:38.530
But I don't know.

00:26:38.530 --> 00:26:39.190
I sucked at it.

00:26:39.190 --> 00:26:40.870
I was just getting
batted around.

00:26:40.870 --> 00:26:41.470
ASIA SEAVERS: I'm taking my--

00:26:41.470 --> 00:26:42.490
RACHAEL RAY: Like
something got sucked up

00:26:42.490 --> 00:26:43.406
in the vacuum cleaner.

00:26:43.406 --> 00:26:44.620
I felt like I was in a Dyson.

00:26:44.620 --> 00:26:45.892
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:45.892 --> 00:26:47.850
ASIA SEAVERS: This is
what the dust feels like.

00:26:47.850 --> 00:26:48.370
RACHAEL RAY: No, it was--

00:26:48.370 --> 00:26:48.790
ASIA SEAVERS: Just freaking out.

00:26:48.790 --> 00:26:49.790
RACHAEL RAY: --not cool.

00:26:49.790 --> 00:26:51.110
It wasn't good.

00:26:51.110 --> 00:26:54.160
I think I need a lot more
practice time in those tubes.

00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:55.572
I did not do a respectable job.

00:26:55.572 --> 00:26:56.780
ASIA SEAVERS: All the tricks.

00:26:56.780 --> 00:26:58.840
Have you mastered any
tricks going airborne?

00:26:58.840 --> 00:27:00.130
RACHAEL RAY: I love
doing tricks but it's

00:27:00.130 --> 00:27:01.630
easy to do tricks when
you jump out of planes

00:27:01.630 --> 00:27:03.910
because you can't go by yourself
till after you go four times.

00:27:03.910 --> 00:27:04.780
So they do whatever you want.

00:27:04.780 --> 00:27:05.440
ASIA SEAVERS: OK.

00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:06.856
RACHAEL RAY: So
my guy that I love

00:27:06.856 --> 00:27:08.547
to go with, he's been
over 10,000 times.

00:27:08.547 --> 00:27:11.130
So he would spin us and flip us
and do all that kind of stuff.

00:27:11.130 --> 00:27:11.440
ASIA SEAVERS: That makes sense.

00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:12.244
RACHAEL RAY: Yep.

00:27:12.244 --> 00:27:13.410
That's what I love about it.

00:27:13.410 --> 00:27:16.302
Because you can be like Iron
Man for a couple of seconds.

00:27:16.302 --> 00:27:17.680
ASIA SEAVERS: I love Iron Man.

00:27:17.680 --> 00:27:18.700
RACHAEL RAY: I know, me, too.

00:27:18.700 --> 00:27:20.065
ASIA SEAVERS: I'm like,
I need to do this.

00:27:20.065 --> 00:27:20.410
No.

00:27:20.410 --> 00:27:21.520
RACHAEL RAY: I so
wish I had the ability

00:27:21.520 --> 00:27:22.894
to be an actress
because I really

00:27:22.894 --> 00:27:24.520
want to do those action movies.

00:27:24.520 --> 00:27:26.604
I want to shoot guns, kill
people, jump off stuff.

00:27:26.604 --> 00:27:28.644
ASIA SEAVERS: No stunt
double, just straight up--

00:27:28.644 --> 00:27:30.321
RACHAEL RAY: No,
that's the fun part.

00:27:30.321 --> 00:27:31.820
ASIA SEAVERS: No,
I would be afraid.

00:27:31.820 --> 00:27:31.940
I'm like, no--

00:27:31.940 --> 00:27:32.500
RACHAEL RAY: No, not me.

00:27:32.500 --> 00:27:32.920
ASIA SEAVERS: --don't hit me.

00:27:32.920 --> 00:27:33.100
RACHAEL RAY: That look like--

00:27:33.100 --> 00:27:33.760
ASIA SEAVERS: Don't it.

00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:34.957
RACHAEL RAY: --so much fun.

00:27:34.957 --> 00:27:36.290
I just want to get in the there.

00:27:36.290 --> 00:27:36.940
ASIA SEAVERS: Flipping out cars.

00:27:36.940 --> 00:27:38.640
"Fast and Furious," you're next.

00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:39.390
RACHAEL RAY: Yeah.

00:27:39.390 --> 00:27:41.770
Well, no, not with the cars
so much, more hand-to-hand.

00:27:41.770 --> 00:27:42.620
ASIA SEAVERS: OK.

00:27:42.620 --> 00:27:44.110
All right, "Mission Impossible."

00:27:44.110 --> 00:27:44.230
RACHAEL RAY: It's weird.

00:27:44.230 --> 00:27:44.470
ASIA SEAVERS: There we go.

00:27:44.470 --> 00:27:46.030
RACHAEL RAY: A lot of people
think of them as nightmares

00:27:46.030 --> 00:27:48.500
but I have dreams where I'm
like in bar brawls and stuff

00:27:48.500 --> 00:27:49.870
and I'm a bad ass.

00:27:49.870 --> 00:27:52.750
That, to me, is super fun
and I wake up all excited.

00:27:52.750 --> 00:27:54.330
ASIA SEAVERS: Did you know what
my dream was about last night?

00:27:54.330 --> 00:27:55.724
Do you write your dreams down?

00:27:55.724 --> 00:27:56.390
RACHAEL RAY: No.

00:27:56.390 --> 00:27:56.665
ASIA SEAVERS: No?

00:27:56.665 --> 00:27:57.331
RACHAEL RAY: No.

00:27:57.331 --> 00:27:59.140
I do have notebooks everywhere.

00:27:59.140 --> 00:28:02.420
Everything that I do, whether
it's a piece of furniture,

00:28:02.420 --> 00:28:06.250
a recipe, every single
thing I make in my home,

00:28:06.250 --> 00:28:08.650
I have over 20
years of notebooks.

00:28:08.650 --> 00:28:10.960
Every single cookbook,
everything that I

00:28:10.960 --> 00:28:12.330
do, I write in notebooks.

00:28:12.330 --> 00:28:13.830
I do have a notebook
next to my bed,

00:28:13.830 --> 00:28:15.080
but I don't write down dreams.

00:28:15.080 --> 00:28:16.917
I rarely even remember them.

00:28:16.917 --> 00:28:19.000
I do write down recipes
in the middle of the night

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:23.260
or if I come up with an idea
for a different shape of pillow

00:28:23.260 --> 00:28:26.980
or a different type of
end table or something

00:28:26.980 --> 00:28:29.350
or a different shape of
pop we haven't done yet,

00:28:29.350 --> 00:28:31.160
I do keep the notebook
there for that.

00:28:31.160 --> 00:28:32.940
ASIA SEAVERS:
Rachael Ray library.

00:28:32.940 --> 00:28:34.315
RACHAEL RAY: That's
creepy, but--

00:28:34.315 --> 00:28:35.090
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:35.090 --> 00:28:36.400
ASIA SEAVERS: I was thinking--

00:28:36.400 --> 00:28:39.530
RACHAEL RAY: And they're all
just those regular composition

00:28:39.530 --> 00:28:40.030
books.

00:28:40.030 --> 00:28:40.390
ASIA SEAVERS: Oh, OK.

00:28:40.390 --> 00:28:40.959
Yeah.

00:28:40.959 --> 00:28:41.750
Oh, that's amazing.

00:28:41.750 --> 00:28:43.870
RACHAEL RAY: I have a
whole cellar full of them.

00:28:43.870 --> 00:28:45.910
ASIA SEAVERS: Is there a food
that you absolutely hate?

00:28:45.910 --> 00:28:47.350
You talked about
food that you love--

00:28:47.350 --> 00:28:48.266
RACHAEL RAY: Not hate.

00:28:48.266 --> 00:28:50.680
Again, I think that if
you're blessed enough not

00:28:50.680 --> 00:28:51.760
to be going hungry--

00:28:51.760 --> 00:28:55.340
I mean, I would literally
eat anything and I have.

00:28:55.340 --> 00:28:58.180
I have, literally, probably
eaten everything there is.

00:28:58.180 --> 00:28:59.380
ASIA SEAVERS: What's the
craziest thing you've eaten?

00:28:59.380 --> 00:29:01.171
RACHAEL RAY: I mean,
I've eaten everything.

00:29:01.171 --> 00:29:03.190
I've eaten every organ
in animals' bodies.

00:29:03.190 --> 00:29:06.850
I've eaten bugs and
all that kind of stuff.

00:29:06.850 --> 00:29:08.422
Things I don't really love--

00:29:08.422 --> 00:29:09.130
ASIA SEAVERS: OK.

00:29:09.130 --> 00:29:12.682
RACHAEL RAY: --I don't like the
mouth feel of cooked salmon.

00:29:12.682 --> 00:29:13.390
ASIA SEAVERS: OK.

00:29:13.390 --> 00:29:15.060
RACHAEL RAY: Not
really my thing.

00:29:15.060 --> 00:29:18.040
But I love smoked
salmon and every type

00:29:18.040 --> 00:29:19.190
of sashimi and sushi.

00:29:19.190 --> 00:29:20.930
But I don't love cooked salmon.

00:29:20.930 --> 00:29:22.770
Kind of meh.

00:29:22.770 --> 00:29:25.106
And I don't like store
bought mayonnaise

00:29:25.106 --> 00:29:26.480
because I didn't
grow up with it.

00:29:26.480 --> 00:29:31.150
I make aioli and I am
obsessed with Fabanaise,

00:29:31.150 --> 00:29:32.560
the egg-less mayonnaise.

00:29:32.560 --> 00:29:34.780
Love the consistency of
it, use it all the time.

00:29:34.780 --> 00:29:36.694
It's fabulous.

00:29:36.694 --> 00:29:38.110
But I just didn't
grow up with it.

00:29:38.110 --> 00:29:42.090
So I'm not the first one in
line at the mayo bar, [LAUGHS]

00:29:42.090 --> 00:29:45.370
at the condiment station at
wherever But there's really

00:29:45.370 --> 00:29:47.232
nothing I wouldn't eat or try.

00:29:47.232 --> 00:29:49.690
ASIA SEAVERS: Now, what is your
favorite, absolute favorite

00:29:49.690 --> 00:29:50.920
food that you could--

00:29:50.920 --> 00:29:51.545
RACHAEL RAY: Don't have one.

00:29:51.545 --> 00:29:51.820
ASIA SEAVERS: [GASPS]

00:29:51.820 --> 00:29:53.080
RACHAEL RAY: Seriously don't.

00:29:53.080 --> 00:29:56.240
I mean, I love pasta.

00:29:56.240 --> 00:29:59.050
I love primarily
Mediterranean food.

00:29:59.050 --> 00:30:00.925
But again, I'm not picky.

00:30:00.925 --> 00:30:03.970
If I haven't had a really great
scrambled egg or an omelet

00:30:03.970 --> 00:30:06.812
in a while and I make
an omelet that I'm like,

00:30:06.812 --> 00:30:07.770
oh, that's really good.

00:30:07.770 --> 00:30:09.040
That's the best
thing I ever had.

00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:09.540
Do you know what I mean?

00:30:09.540 --> 00:30:10.380
ASIA SEAVERS: Right.

00:30:10.380 --> 00:30:11.970
RACHAEL RAY: I think a lot of
people that cook for a living

00:30:11.970 --> 00:30:12.750
are like that.

00:30:12.750 --> 00:30:13.767
We're just not picky.

00:30:13.767 --> 00:30:15.100
ASIA SEAVERS: We just like food.

00:30:15.100 --> 00:30:15.780
I love food.

00:30:15.780 --> 00:30:17.730
Now, there are
preferences though.

00:30:17.730 --> 00:30:20.679
Kale versus broccoli, which one?

00:30:20.679 --> 00:30:22.720
RACHAEL RAY: They're both
cruciferous vegetables.

00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:24.430
I like them both.

00:30:24.430 --> 00:30:27.060
I like-- I don't
love a kale salad

00:30:27.060 --> 00:30:32.230
unless it can set for a while
and start to get and proper

00:30:32.230 --> 00:30:34.390
and have a good chew to it.

00:30:34.390 --> 00:30:36.460
But I liked kale
before kale was cool.

00:30:36.460 --> 00:30:38.540
My grandpa grew kale
when I was this big.

00:30:38.540 --> 00:30:42.190
So I was a kid that nobody
wanted to sit next to

00:30:42.190 --> 00:30:45.880
in kindergarten or first
grade because my lunch stank.

00:30:45.880 --> 00:30:48.334
Sardines sandwiches
with onions and--

00:30:48.334 --> 00:30:49.250
ASIA SEAVERS: Perfect.

00:30:49.250 --> 00:30:51.700
RACHAEL RAY: --pickled kale
or pickled garden vegetables

00:30:51.700 --> 00:30:53.507
and a big old sardine
sandwich was my life.

00:30:53.507 --> 00:30:54.340
ASIA SEAVERS: Right.

00:30:54.340 --> 00:30:54.930
So what did you have--

00:30:54.930 --> 00:30:56.888
RACHAEL RAY: I was not
it is especially popular

00:30:56.888 --> 00:30:57.555
super young kid.

00:30:57.555 --> 00:30:59.888
ASIA SEAVERS: Just in the
lunchroom opening up sardines,

00:30:59.888 --> 00:31:00.935
hey, you want to trade?

00:31:00.935 --> 00:31:01.230
No.

00:31:01.230 --> 00:31:01.680
RACHAEL RAY: No.

00:31:01.680 --> 00:31:02.180
Nope.

00:31:02.180 --> 00:31:02.840
Trade?

00:31:02.840 --> 00:31:04.530
Nobody would even sit
at the table, man.

00:31:04.530 --> 00:31:05.280
No.

00:31:05.280 --> 00:31:07.738
ASIA SEAVERS: I like any food
that makes your breath stink.

00:31:07.738 --> 00:31:09.460
I love anchovies,
olives, onions.

00:31:09.460 --> 00:31:09.980
RACHAEL RAY: We have
a lot in common.

00:31:09.980 --> 00:31:11.680
ASIA SEAVERS: They're
just like, mm, yes.

00:31:11.680 --> 00:31:12.280
RACHAEL RAY: Yes.

00:31:12.280 --> 00:31:13.160
ASIA SEAVERS: They nurture the--

00:31:13.160 --> 00:31:14.860
RACHAEL RAY: Down
with the anchovies.

00:31:14.860 --> 00:31:15.910
ASIA SEAVERS: Always.

00:31:15.910 --> 00:31:17.380
OK, we have a speed round.

00:31:17.380 --> 00:31:19.165
Are you ready for
the speed round?

00:31:19.165 --> 00:31:21.040
RACHAEL RAY: You'll be
surprised at how bad I

00:31:21.040 --> 00:31:21.831
am at speed rounds.

00:31:21.831 --> 00:31:22.869
ASIA SEAVERS: What?

00:31:22.869 --> 00:31:24.160
RACHAEL RAY: No, I'm too wordy.

00:31:24.160 --> 00:31:25.440
I talk too much.

00:31:25.440 --> 00:31:27.310
And there's always
a but, but whatever.

00:31:27.310 --> 00:31:27.850
I'll try.

00:31:27.850 --> 00:31:29.032
I'll do my best.

00:31:29.032 --> 00:31:29.740
ASIA SEAVERS: OK.

00:31:29.740 --> 00:31:32.279
So I know that you like all
foods but you have to pick, OK?

00:31:32.279 --> 00:31:33.070
You have to choose.

00:31:33.070 --> 00:31:35.111
RACHAEL RAY: No, I'm not
going to play your game.

00:31:35.111 --> 00:31:36.335
ASIA SEAVERS: You-- no.

00:31:36.335 --> 00:31:38.210
RACHAEL RAY: I'm not
going to play your game.

00:31:38.210 --> 00:31:39.200
ASIA SEAVERS: No, Rachael--

00:31:39.200 --> 00:31:40.450
RACHAEL RAY: I have
a friend, Melanie--

00:31:40.450 --> 00:31:41.290
see, here we go.

00:31:41.290 --> 00:31:42.700
Now here's a really long story.

00:31:42.700 --> 00:31:43.750
ASIA SEAVERS: Go for it.

00:31:43.750 --> 00:31:45.625
RACHAEL RAY: Melanie is
a famous photographer

00:31:45.625 --> 00:31:47.826
and she does this series
of books, "The Last Meal"

00:31:47.826 --> 00:31:48.700
or "The Last Supper."

00:31:48.700 --> 00:31:50.408
It's all these chefs
and what they'd eat.

00:31:50.408 --> 00:31:52.265
And she asked me
to do the first one

00:31:52.265 --> 00:31:54.140
and I said, oh, that
makes me so creeped out.

00:31:54.140 --> 00:31:55.056
I don't want to do it.

00:31:55.056 --> 00:31:57.460
I ended up in the
sequel to that book.

00:31:57.460 --> 00:31:59.770
And the only way I could
do it was to say the truth.

00:31:59.770 --> 00:32:02.110
If I knew it was my
last meal, I wouldn't

00:32:02.110 --> 00:32:03.640
be worried about eating.

00:32:03.640 --> 00:32:06.940
I'd be doing some serious
drugs or drinking.

00:32:06.940 --> 00:32:08.857
I'd be really bummed out.

00:32:08.857 --> 00:32:09.940
ASIA SEAVERS: That's true.

00:32:09.940 --> 00:32:13.150
RACHAEL RAY: But I would
want my first meal,

00:32:13.150 --> 00:32:15.490
if there was an
afterlife in some form

00:32:15.490 --> 00:32:17.602
to be with my grandfather
and my first dog.

00:32:17.602 --> 00:32:18.310
ASIA SEAVERS: OK.

00:32:18.310 --> 00:32:20.335
RACHAEL RAY: Boo loved
butternut squash more

00:32:20.335 --> 00:32:21.460
than anything in the world.

00:32:21.460 --> 00:32:23.337
So it would be butternut
squash for Boo.

00:32:23.337 --> 00:32:25.420
And my grandpa and I loved
sardines and anchovies.

00:32:25.420 --> 00:32:27.610
So we'd have spaghetti
with sardines or anchovies

00:32:27.610 --> 00:32:30.050
and a side of roast
squash, and I'd

00:32:30.050 --> 00:32:33.610
be eating with the Runzo
boys, my grandpa's best

00:32:33.610 --> 00:32:36.760
friends and my grandpa
and my first pit bull.

00:32:36.760 --> 00:32:38.226
That's who I'd be eating with.

00:32:38.226 --> 00:32:39.850
That's as close as
you're going to get.

00:32:39.850 --> 00:32:40.850
ASIA SEAVERS: Thank you.

00:32:40.850 --> 00:32:42.070
I appreciate it.

00:32:42.070 --> 00:32:43.681
Now, you cook a lot.

00:32:43.681 --> 00:32:45.430
Do you ever go out on
the town, and if you

00:32:45.430 --> 00:32:47.800
do, what is one of your
top favorite restaurants?

00:32:47.800 --> 00:32:49.530
RACHAEL RAY:

00:32:49.530 --> 00:32:53.400
RACHAEL RAY: I'd like to go out
when we're taking friends out

00:32:53.400 --> 00:32:56.370
or if I have friends
visiting and they don't get

00:32:56.370 --> 00:32:59.310
to go out in New York a lot.

00:32:59.310 --> 00:33:00.274
I like a lot of places.

00:33:00.274 --> 00:33:01.440
You have to pick a category.

00:33:01.440 --> 00:33:04.920
I love Madame Vo
for Vietnamese food.

00:33:04.920 --> 00:33:06.697
ASIA SEAVERS: OK.

00:33:06.697 --> 00:33:08.030
RACHAEL RAY: I mean, it depends.

00:33:08.030 --> 00:33:10.590
I live Via Carota if I'm going
to have Italian food that I

00:33:10.590 --> 00:33:12.240
didn't make myself.

00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:15.200
I love Via Carota.

00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:21.040
Pizza, we like Speedy Romeo
and Motorino and Mexican food,

00:33:21.040 --> 00:33:25.590
I like Toro Blanco,
Josh Capon's place.

00:33:25.590 --> 00:33:26.700
It depends on what it is.

00:33:26.700 --> 00:33:27.180
ASIA SEAVERS: Yeah.

00:33:27.180 --> 00:33:28.596
RACHAEL RAY: If
it's Chinese food,

00:33:28.596 --> 00:33:32.836
I like this Australian
Chinese restaurant.

00:33:32.836 --> 00:33:34.460
[INAUDIBLE],, what
is the name of that?

00:33:34.460 --> 00:33:35.635
AUDIENCE: Chinese Tuxedo.

00:33:35.635 --> 00:33:37.010
RACHAEL RAY: Yes,
Chinese Tuxedo.

00:33:37.010 --> 00:33:37.830
Love that place.

00:33:37.830 --> 00:33:39.856
Very sexy.

00:33:39.856 --> 00:33:41.230
You know, it
depends on the food.

00:33:41.230 --> 00:33:43.670
I have a place I like to go
to for pretty much anything.

00:33:43.670 --> 00:33:44.910
Sure, I live in New York.

00:33:44.910 --> 00:33:45.743
ASIA SEAVERS: Right.

00:33:45.743 --> 00:33:46.770
It's a big city.

00:33:46.770 --> 00:33:49.080
Now, you have to
ask this question.

00:33:49.080 --> 00:33:50.750
What would you do without EVOO?

00:33:53.520 --> 00:33:55.780
RACHAEL RAY: I guess
I'd use canola oil.

00:33:55.780 --> 00:33:56.532
ASIA SEAVERS: No!

00:33:56.532 --> 00:33:57.670
RACHAEL RAY: I mean, what--

00:33:57.670 --> 00:34:00.780
if it didn't exist, that's
your choice I guess.

00:34:00.780 --> 00:34:01.770
Avocado oil?

00:34:01.770 --> 00:34:02.610
I don't know.

00:34:02.610 --> 00:34:06.180
I mean, I only use olive
oil because that's--

00:34:06.180 --> 00:34:08.219
my grandpa is an
Italian-American immigrant

00:34:08.219 --> 00:34:10.710
and that's the fat
we cooked with.

00:34:10.710 --> 00:34:12.570
It's not like I'm an oil hater.

00:34:12.570 --> 00:34:15.989
But that's what we always have
in the pantry because that's

00:34:15.989 --> 00:34:16.698
how I was raised.

00:34:16.698 --> 00:34:18.822
ASIA SEAVERS: I can't
imagine my life without EVOO.

00:34:18.822 --> 00:34:19.800
I'm like, I can't--

00:34:19.800 --> 00:34:21.449
RACHAEL RAY: No, I think it
gives you a nice shiny coat.

00:34:21.449 --> 00:34:24.110
My mom always rubbed it on
her feet, warm, on her feet

00:34:24.110 --> 00:34:26.460
and in her hair.

00:34:26.460 --> 00:34:29.334
Maybe too much
information, but you know.

00:34:29.334 --> 00:34:30.375
We use it for everything.

00:34:30.375 --> 00:34:32.820
[LAUGHS]

00:34:32.820 --> 00:34:34.800
ASIA SEAVERS: Well, thank
you so much, Rachael.

00:34:34.800 --> 00:34:35.690
RACHAEL RAY: That was easy.

00:34:35.690 --> 00:34:36.110
ASIA SEAVERS: It was a pleasure.

00:34:36.110 --> 00:34:36.540
RACHAEL RAY: That was fun.

00:34:36.540 --> 00:34:37.415
ASIA SEAVERS: It was.

00:34:37.415 --> 00:34:38.909
I'm not like, [GROWLS].

00:34:38.909 --> 00:34:39.414
No, no?

00:34:39.414 --> 00:34:39.914
Was I scary?

00:34:39.914 --> 00:34:41.010
RACHAEL RAY: No, you're
not scary at all.

00:34:41.010 --> 00:34:41.760
ASIA SEAVERS: Yay!

00:34:41.760 --> 00:34:42.389
Whoop, whoop.

00:34:42.389 --> 00:34:45.330
So what we're going to do now
is open the questioning up

00:34:45.330 --> 00:34:46.620
to the audience.

00:34:46.620 --> 00:34:49.179
There's a mic to my left
and a mic to my right.

00:34:49.179 --> 00:34:51.155
If you would like to
line up behind that,

00:34:51.155 --> 00:34:52.280
go ahead and give Rachael--

00:34:52.280 --> 00:34:53.500
RACHAEL RAY: Oh, such a rush.

00:34:53.500 --> 00:34:54.333
ASIA SEAVERS: Right?

00:34:54.333 --> 00:34:56.171
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:56.171 --> 00:34:56.670
No, really.

00:34:56.670 --> 00:34:57.180
Be my guest.

00:34:57.180 --> 00:34:58.410
Go for it.

00:34:58.410 --> 00:35:00.450
RACHAEL RAY: I answer anything.

00:35:00.450 --> 00:35:01.537
Have fun with it.

00:35:01.537 --> 00:35:03.870
AUDIENCE: I'm right near the
mic so I figured I should--

00:35:03.870 --> 00:35:05.180
RACHAEL RAY: Oh, you
have a nice voice.

00:35:05.180 --> 00:35:05.440
ASIA SEAVERS: Right?

00:35:05.440 --> 00:35:06.273
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:35:06.273 --> 00:35:07.414
RACHAEL RAY: Voice envy.

00:35:07.414 --> 00:35:09.330
AUDIENCE: I'm a yoga
teacher on the side, so--

00:35:09.330 --> 00:35:10.652
ASIA SEAVERS: Oh, thank you.

00:35:10.652 --> 00:35:11.340
AUDIENCE: Lots of practice.

00:35:11.340 --> 00:35:13.090
RACHAEL RAY: Lots of
controlled breathing.

00:35:13.090 --> 00:35:14.680
AUDIENCE: Yes, exactly.

00:35:14.680 --> 00:35:16.170
So you're very
humble and talking

00:35:16.170 --> 00:35:19.490
about the beginning of your
career, you just got lucky.

00:35:19.490 --> 00:35:22.500
I'm actually curious to
know, obviously a lot of us

00:35:22.500 --> 00:35:25.230
you work for Google,
probably very goal oriented,

00:35:25.230 --> 00:35:27.030
had an idea in mind
kind of before we

00:35:27.030 --> 00:35:28.140
got into this whole gig.

00:35:28.140 --> 00:35:28.890
RACHAEL RAY: Yeah.

00:35:28.890 --> 00:35:31.017
AUDIENCE: And it sounds like you
are very entrepreneurial right

00:35:31.017 --> 00:35:31.740
from the beginning.

00:35:31.740 --> 00:35:33.323
RACHAEL RAY: I am
very entrepreneurial

00:35:33.323 --> 00:35:36.930
and I like the idea
of being fearless.

00:35:36.930 --> 00:35:38.820
I think if you can
close your eyes

00:35:38.820 --> 00:35:40.395
and see yourself
trying something,

00:35:40.395 --> 00:35:43.020
that that's something
you should then try.

00:35:43.020 --> 00:35:45.350
When I was a little kid, I
started a basket company,

00:35:45.350 --> 00:35:47.040
when delicious Liaisons--

00:35:47.040 --> 00:35:49.860
I mean, when "Dangerous
Liasons" was a movie.

00:35:49.860 --> 00:35:51.750
I started a little
basket company,

00:35:51.750 --> 00:35:53.430
hand drew the whole catalog.

00:35:53.430 --> 00:35:55.080
It was called Delicious Liasons.

00:35:55.080 --> 00:35:56.760
I only sold 45 baskets.

00:35:56.760 --> 00:35:58.437
This was not a big industry.

00:35:58.437 --> 00:35:59.770
But I thought that would be fun.

00:35:59.770 --> 00:36:03.390
And I just liked the name
in my head so I did it.

00:36:03.390 --> 00:36:05.450
I think that it's
good to be fearless

00:36:05.450 --> 00:36:08.040
and that you do need to be
able to picture yourself trying

00:36:08.040 --> 00:36:09.030
something.

00:36:09.030 --> 00:36:13.230
But my mom taught
me a great lesson.

00:36:13.230 --> 00:36:16.020
Always work harder
than everybody else

00:36:16.020 --> 00:36:21.430
and be grateful for that job
and you'll get opportunity.

00:36:21.430 --> 00:36:24.480
And of the opportunities
that present themselves,

00:36:24.480 --> 00:36:28.270
if you can close your eyes
and see yourself trying it,

00:36:28.270 --> 00:36:30.160
what's the worst thing
that could happen?

00:36:30.160 --> 00:36:33.059
You go back to the thing you
were already grateful for.

00:36:33.059 --> 00:36:35.350
That's why you have to start
with gratitude and working

00:36:35.350 --> 00:36:36.370
harder.

00:36:36.370 --> 00:36:39.310
If you can work harder than
anybody else and be grateful,

00:36:39.310 --> 00:36:40.960
you can be literally fearless.

00:36:40.960 --> 00:36:42.490
It's like jumping
out of an airplane

00:36:42.490 --> 00:36:44.560
because the only
thing that can happen

00:36:44.560 --> 00:36:46.509
is you go back to what
you were doing before.

00:36:46.509 --> 00:36:47.300
ASIA SEAVERS: Yeah.

00:36:47.300 --> 00:36:52.930
RACHAEL RAY: So I truly believe
that's the key to my life.

00:36:52.930 --> 00:36:55.690
And going to bed feeling
good and getting out of bed

00:36:55.690 --> 00:36:58.330
feeling good is that
if the worst thing that

00:36:58.330 --> 00:37:01.555
can happen to you is what
you were doing last month,

00:37:01.555 --> 00:37:05.724
last year, last week,
then you can try anything.

00:37:05.724 --> 00:37:07.390
AUDIENCE: You'd be a
great yoga teacher.

00:37:07.390 --> 00:37:08.440
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:08.440 --> 00:37:10.840
RACHAEL RAY: I
think I'm too loud.

00:37:10.840 --> 00:37:13.600
A friend of mine has a yoga
studio and she's really cool

00:37:13.600 --> 00:37:15.880
and I'm always so scared
to go there because I

00:37:15.880 --> 00:37:17.380
don't want to embarrass her.

00:37:17.380 --> 00:37:19.750
I don't want to be the
person that goes, ha!

00:37:19.750 --> 00:37:20.250
You know?

00:37:20.250 --> 00:37:22.900
Or somebody falls over
and I accidentally laugh.

00:37:22.900 --> 00:37:25.567
Or I pass some gross gas
or weird burp or something.

00:37:25.567 --> 00:37:27.400
ASIA SEAVERS: That is
me in the yoga studio.

00:37:27.400 --> 00:37:29.025
RACHAEL RAY: I always
pictured myself--

00:37:29.025 --> 00:37:30.910
that is something I'm
really phobic about.

00:37:30.910 --> 00:37:32.320
I really want to try yoga.

00:37:32.320 --> 00:37:33.250
I was a cheerleader.

00:37:33.250 --> 00:37:34.291
I'm very bendy, stretchy.

00:37:34.291 --> 00:37:35.740
I think I'd be
good at it, but I'm

00:37:35.740 --> 00:37:38.227
petrified to go because
I think I'm too loud.

00:37:38.227 --> 00:37:39.560
ASIA SEAVERS: I am loud in yoga.

00:37:39.560 --> 00:37:41.410
RACHAEL RAY: I'm also scared
to go to really, really

00:37:41.410 --> 00:37:42.280
fine restaurants.

00:37:42.280 --> 00:37:43.030
ASIA SEAVERS: OK.

00:37:43.030 --> 00:37:45.710
RACHAEL RAY: When you get up the
Michelin star scale, petrified.

00:37:45.710 --> 00:37:46.512
ASIA SEAVERS: Yep.

00:37:46.512 --> 00:37:48.970
RACHAEL RAY: Because I just
feel like I'm not in that club.

00:37:48.970 --> 00:37:49.450
ASIA SEAVERS: Right.

00:37:49.450 --> 00:37:50.366
RACHAEL RAY: You know?

00:37:50.366 --> 00:37:52.930
Somehow, I start to sweat
when I walk through the door.

00:37:52.930 --> 00:37:53.440
ASIA SEAVERS: Am I
doing this right?

00:37:53.440 --> 00:37:54.970
RACHAEL RAY: Like they're
going to come from me mid-meal

00:37:54.970 --> 00:37:57.303
and say, excuse me, Miss Ray,
but you're really just not

00:37:57.303 --> 00:37:58.410
our client here.

00:37:58.410 --> 00:37:59.332
[LAUGHS]

00:37:59.332 --> 00:38:00.350
ASIA SEAVERS: Am I
using the right fork?

00:38:00.350 --> 00:38:00.970
RACHAEL RAY: It's the truth.

00:38:00.970 --> 00:38:01.720
ASIA SEAVERS: What is going on?

00:38:01.720 --> 00:38:02.610
RACHAEL RAY: It's the truth.

00:38:02.610 --> 00:38:04.068
Every once in
awhile, I get invited

00:38:04.068 --> 00:38:06.805
to those types of places
and I'm always petrified.

00:38:06.805 --> 00:38:09.430
And I'm not hungry
because I'm so nervous.

00:38:09.430 --> 00:38:10.720
I don't want to eat anything.

00:38:10.720 --> 00:38:12.930
So then it looks like I'm
rude and inappropriate.

00:38:12.930 --> 00:38:13.650
ASIA SEAVERS: Oh.

00:38:13.650 --> 00:38:15.140
You've got to get a
side salad, something.

00:38:15.140 --> 00:38:15.310
Just--

00:38:15.310 --> 00:38:15.700
RACHAEL RAY: I know.

00:38:15.700 --> 00:38:16.390
ASIA SEAVERS: --one time.

00:38:16.390 --> 00:38:17.020
RACHAEL RAY: I know.

00:38:17.020 --> 00:38:18.728
I need therapy, if
one only had the time.

00:38:18.728 --> 00:38:20.524
[LAUGHS]

00:38:20.524 --> 00:38:21.940
ASIA SEAVERS: Any
other questions?

00:38:21.940 --> 00:38:22.870
Next question.

00:38:22.870 --> 00:38:23.560
Hey, go for it.

00:38:23.560 --> 00:38:24.970
AUDIENCE: Hi, Rachael.

00:38:24.970 --> 00:38:26.950
Shameless plug, I was
on your show twice.

00:38:26.950 --> 00:38:27.220
RACHAEL RAY: Woo-hoo!

00:38:27.220 --> 00:38:28.090
Did you have fun?

00:38:28.090 --> 00:38:28.930
AUDIENCE: I had an amazing time.

00:38:28.930 --> 00:38:30.680
The first time, I asked
Mario Lopez on a date.

00:38:30.680 --> 00:38:31.320
He chickened out.

00:38:31.320 --> 00:38:32.020
RACHAEL RAY: Nice.

00:38:32.020 --> 00:38:32.760
AUDIENCE: And the second time--

00:38:32.760 --> 00:38:33.590
RACHAEL RAY: His loss.

00:38:33.590 --> 00:38:34.256
You're stunning.

00:38:34.256 --> 00:38:35.070
[LAUGHS]

00:38:35.070 --> 00:38:36.230
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:38:36.230 --> 00:38:37.690
And then the second
time, we did the potluck.

00:38:37.690 --> 00:38:38.690
I don't know if you
remember that show.

00:38:38.690 --> 00:38:39.700
It was a potluck, bring--

00:38:39.700 --> 00:38:41.100
RACHAEL RAY: Oh,
everybody brought dishes.

00:38:41.100 --> 00:38:41.500
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:38:41.500 --> 00:38:41.900
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:38:41.900 --> 00:38:42.550
And I--

00:38:42.550 --> 00:38:43.925
RACHAEL RAY:
Literally a potluck.

00:38:43.925 --> 00:38:45.700
AUDIENCE: --did the
Italian skewers.

00:38:45.700 --> 00:38:46.120
RACHAEL RAY: Nice.

00:38:46.120 --> 00:38:48.190
AUDIENCE: And that was way
before I decided to be vegan.

00:38:48.190 --> 00:38:49.260
I decided to be crazy--

00:38:49.260 --> 00:38:51.490
RACHAEL RAY: Hey, man, I
am very into the vegan.

00:38:51.490 --> 00:38:54.610
I have broken down every wall.

00:38:54.610 --> 00:38:57.430
I used to be like, aw, man,
can't we all just get along

00:38:57.430 --> 00:38:59.420
and live in moderation?

00:38:59.420 --> 00:39:03.950
I have studied so much,
trying to educate myself

00:39:03.950 --> 00:39:08.290
about vegan, vegetarian,
and I'm down with it now.

00:39:08.290 --> 00:39:09.150
I really am.

00:39:09.150 --> 00:39:09.850
AUDIENCE: Well,
that's my question.

00:39:09.850 --> 00:39:11.710
I was going to ask you what's
your favorite vegan dish.

00:39:11.710 --> 00:39:12.910
RACHAEL RAY: You
know, it depends.

00:39:12.910 --> 00:39:14.743
I write a lot of them
for some of our guests

00:39:14.743 --> 00:39:15.880
that are, of course, vegan.

00:39:15.880 --> 00:39:20.980
This time of year, my
lentil and beet soup is--

00:39:20.980 --> 00:39:23.350
you got to go and
download this immediately.

00:39:23.350 --> 00:39:26.290
I wrote it for Alan
Cummings was on the show

00:39:26.290 --> 00:39:28.030
and I love him so much.

00:39:28.030 --> 00:39:29.429
I'm obsessed with that soup.

00:39:29.429 --> 00:39:31.720
It's so easy to make and it's
the perfect time of year.

00:39:31.720 --> 00:39:36.850
Beets are so cheap and cheerful
right now and just delicious.

00:39:36.850 --> 00:39:38.380
And do you eat pasta?

00:39:38.380 --> 00:39:39.330
Do you--

00:39:39.330 --> 00:39:39.660
ASIA SEAVERS: Yeah.

00:39:39.660 --> 00:39:41.201
RACHAEL RAY: Are
you down with pasta?

00:39:41.201 --> 00:39:44.470
So I make a pasta that's
cooked in red wine

00:39:44.470 --> 00:39:48.400
with roasted beets
and beet greens.

00:39:48.400 --> 00:39:50.620
You want to get into
anybody's anything, make that.

00:39:50.620 --> 00:39:51.161
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:39:51.161 --> 00:39:53.255
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:53.255 --> 00:39:54.880
RACHAEL RAY: Just
don't made for people

00:39:54.880 --> 00:39:58.000
you don't really, really like,
because they will come back

00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:00.610
and you know, that's that.

00:40:00.610 --> 00:40:02.950
I also love-- my favorite
restaurant that's vegan,

00:40:02.950 --> 00:40:04.300
vegetarian is Nix.

00:40:04.300 --> 00:40:05.290
Have you been to Nix?

00:40:05.290 --> 00:40:06.820
AUDIENCE: I haven't been.

00:40:06.820 --> 00:40:08.950
RACHAEL RAY: I'm going
to change your world.

00:40:08.950 --> 00:40:12.250
So Nix is in my neighborhood.

00:40:12.250 --> 00:40:16.519
My husband, his favorite word
other than scotch is pork.

00:40:16.519 --> 00:40:19.060
My husband loves this restaurant
and we go there once a week,

00:40:19.060 --> 00:40:20.320
no problem.

00:40:20.320 --> 00:40:25.180
Nix is the name of the
Supreme Court case in America

00:40:25.180 --> 00:40:29.980
that allowed produce people
to classify tomatoes, which

00:40:29.980 --> 00:40:32.470
are fruits, as vegetables
because they thought

00:40:32.470 --> 00:40:33.640
it was better PR.

00:40:33.640 --> 00:40:34.840
That's insane.

00:40:34.840 --> 00:40:37.300
It's "Nix versus" whatever's
the name of the case.

00:40:37.300 --> 00:40:40.030
So Nix, N-I-X is the
name of the restaurant.

00:40:40.030 --> 00:40:44.080
It's all vegan, vegetarian
and it is amazing.

00:40:44.080 --> 00:40:48.430
They make duck buns that aren't
duck, they're cauliflower.

00:40:48.430 --> 00:40:50.150
They make braised
pork shoulder that's

00:40:50.150 --> 00:40:53.260
a cabbage that tastes
smoky and crazy.

00:40:53.260 --> 00:40:54.800
It is the find of the century.

00:40:54.800 --> 00:40:58.450
They make little
shiitake mushroom tacos.

00:40:58.450 --> 00:41:00.887
They have insane tandoor
bread with all sorts

00:41:00.887 --> 00:41:01.720
of dips and spreads.

00:41:01.720 --> 00:41:02.717
Go to Nix, immediately.

00:41:02.717 --> 00:41:04.300
And they have one
of the best cocktail

00:41:04.300 --> 00:41:06.130
programs in New York City.

00:41:06.130 --> 00:41:07.730
You will have the best--

00:41:07.730 --> 00:41:09.970
again, only take people you
like there because you'll

00:41:09.970 --> 00:41:11.800
have to return with them.

00:41:11.800 --> 00:41:14.265
AUDIENCE: Rachael, instead of
Mario, will you be my date?

00:41:14.265 --> 00:41:15.750
RACHAEL RAY: Absolutely.

00:41:15.750 --> 00:41:16.810
I live in the hood.

00:41:16.810 --> 00:41:18.320
Easy.

00:41:18.320 --> 00:41:18.880
Done.

00:41:18.880 --> 00:41:19.630
AUDIENCE: Perfect.

00:41:19.630 --> 00:41:21.279
Thank you.

00:41:21.279 --> 00:41:22.320
RACHAEL RAY: I love that.

00:41:22.320 --> 00:41:23.510
Maybe I'll be in page six.

00:41:23.510 --> 00:41:26.635
Rachael had a lesbian date.

00:41:26.635 --> 00:41:28.230
She was so hot for this girl.

00:41:28.230 --> 00:41:29.355
ASIA SEAVERS: Whoop, whoop.

00:41:31.414 --> 00:41:32.330
AUDIENCE: Hi, Rachael.

00:41:32.330 --> 00:41:34.310
RACHAEL RAY: I would love to
be in somebody's cool gossip

00:41:34.310 --> 00:41:34.810
column.

00:41:34.810 --> 00:41:35.643
ASIA SEAVERS: Right.

00:41:35.643 --> 00:41:37.610
RACHAEL RAY: So not
the lame, you know,

00:41:37.610 --> 00:41:38.810
I cook better than her.

00:41:38.810 --> 00:41:39.860
I don't like her.

00:41:39.860 --> 00:41:41.400
I want to be
something that's cool.

00:41:41.400 --> 00:41:42.430
ASIA SEAVERS: Something juicy.

00:41:42.430 --> 00:41:43.805
RACHAEL RAY: Right,
right, right.

00:41:43.805 --> 00:41:45.245
ASIA SEAVERS:
Like, I'm in there.

00:41:45.245 --> 00:41:46.370
AUDIENCE: I had a question.

00:41:46.370 --> 00:41:47.840
I'm a big fan of
your show and the--

00:41:47.840 --> 00:41:48.080
RACHAEL RAY: Thank you.

00:41:48.080 --> 00:41:49.490
AUDIENCE: --other
projects you work on.

00:41:49.490 --> 00:41:52.040
It sounds like there are so many
amazing aspects of your job.

00:41:52.040 --> 00:41:55.550
So I was curious what your
favorite part of your job is.

00:41:55.550 --> 00:41:57.380
And you're such a
positive person,

00:41:57.380 --> 00:41:59.296
I don't know if you'll
be able to answer this,

00:41:59.296 --> 00:42:01.807
but if you have a least
favorite part of your job.

00:42:04.202 --> 00:42:05.660
RACHAEL RAY: Red
carpet anything. .

00:42:05.660 --> 00:42:06.990
AUDIENCE: Least favorite or--

00:42:06.990 --> 00:42:07.781
RACHAEL RAY: Least.

00:42:07.781 --> 00:42:08.620
ASIA SEAVERS: Oh.

00:42:08.620 --> 00:42:12.440
RACHAEL RAY: Any time I have
to be on a carpet, surrounded

00:42:12.440 --> 00:42:15.330
by what I think are
real celebrities,

00:42:15.330 --> 00:42:16.890
I'm sick to my stomach.

00:42:16.890 --> 00:42:19.040
I hate super high heels.

00:42:19.040 --> 00:42:19.890
When I went to--

00:42:19.890 --> 00:42:21.950
I love Michelle
and Barack Obama.

00:42:21.950 --> 00:42:23.990
I got to work with
them for the entirety

00:42:23.990 --> 00:42:26.570
of their administration.

00:42:26.570 --> 00:42:27.420
I miss them.

00:42:27.420 --> 00:42:29.180
I considered them
actual friends,

00:42:29.180 --> 00:42:30.990
which is mind blowing to me.

00:42:30.990 --> 00:42:33.729
But probably the most
embarrassing night of my life

00:42:33.729 --> 00:42:35.270
was going to their
last state dinner,

00:42:35.270 --> 00:42:37.460
which was for the
prime minister of Italy

00:42:37.460 --> 00:42:39.200
and his beautiful wife.

00:42:39.200 --> 00:42:41.540
Walking into the White
House, first of all,

00:42:41.540 --> 00:42:43.130
I chose a dress that
was very autumnal

00:42:43.130 --> 00:42:45.300
because it was late October.

00:42:45.300 --> 00:42:50.060
Freaky summer-like
90-plus day, I'm

00:42:50.060 --> 00:42:53.120
in a dress with a black
turtleneck up to here.

00:42:53.120 --> 00:42:54.950
So a river ran through it.

00:42:54.950 --> 00:42:57.200
I'm pouring sweat
the whole night.

00:42:57.200 --> 00:43:00.230
And walking up the steps, I'm
not even in the White House

00:43:00.230 --> 00:43:03.770
yet, I stick my giant high
heel through the inside lining

00:43:03.770 --> 00:43:06.710
of my dress and rip
the entire thing out

00:43:06.710 --> 00:43:11.004
and tie the tulle around
my foot so much so--

00:43:11.004 --> 00:43:13.420
by the way, I'm getting chills
while I'm telling you this.

00:43:13.420 --> 00:43:16.370
The woman at the desk that's
checking in everybody--

00:43:16.370 --> 00:43:20.660
everybody, prime ministers,
presidents, movie stars--

00:43:20.660 --> 00:43:23.000
she has to leave her
post to go find scissors

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:25.110
to cut my foot out
of the inside lining.

00:43:25.110 --> 00:43:28.200
This is before I even walked
the carpet have the picture.

00:43:28.200 --> 00:43:28.910
Yeah.

00:43:28.910 --> 00:43:30.210
Worst, worst, worst.

00:43:30.210 --> 00:43:32.780
Then I get inside and I find
out we're at the head table.

00:43:32.780 --> 00:43:35.210
No stress there.

00:43:35.210 --> 00:43:37.230
It was like-- I can't.

00:43:37.230 --> 00:43:39.710
I'm hive-y just
talking about it.

00:43:39.710 --> 00:43:41.850
It's so hard to me.

00:43:41.850 --> 00:43:46.240
The thing that makes me
feel most comfortable

00:43:46.240 --> 00:43:48.080
is being in our
studio because I know

00:43:48.080 --> 00:43:52.310
that whether it's somebody
new who's been there

00:43:52.310 --> 00:43:55.640
or somebody that's never been
there, that that's our house

00:43:55.640 --> 00:43:57.300
and we play by our
rules and everybody

00:43:57.300 --> 00:43:58.619
is going to feel comfortable.

00:43:58.619 --> 00:44:00.410
And I feel like I'm in
a really safe place.

00:44:00.410 --> 00:44:03.530
I love being at our job.

00:44:03.530 --> 00:44:06.680
My most favorite thing
that I do in my entire year

00:44:06.680 --> 00:44:11.480
is Feedback, which is a
show I put together 10--

00:44:11.480 --> 00:44:14.890
now 11-- years ago at
South by Southwest.

00:44:14.890 --> 00:44:19.030
My husband is a lawyer by
day but he has a rock band.

00:44:19.030 --> 00:44:21.100
He got into Berklee
School of Music

00:44:21.100 --> 00:44:23.140
but his parents wanted
him to be a lawyer

00:44:23.140 --> 00:44:25.990
so he wussed out and didn't
just pay for his own schooling

00:44:25.990 --> 00:44:28.040
like the rest of the world.

00:44:28.040 --> 00:44:30.490
But he saved me a fortune
over the years because he

00:44:30.490 --> 00:44:32.989
became an entertainment lawyer,
so that came in quite handy.

00:44:32.989 --> 00:44:34.030
ASIA SEAVERS: Right.

00:44:34.030 --> 00:44:36.340
RACHAEL RAY: But we are
both really into music.

00:44:36.340 --> 00:44:39.820
We have about 2,500
vinyl records.

00:44:39.820 --> 00:44:41.560
The most expensive
thing in our apartment

00:44:41.560 --> 00:44:44.020
is our floating record player.

00:44:44.020 --> 00:44:48.640
And we have this
combination of my food,

00:44:48.640 --> 00:44:54.040
sponsored cocktails, no
overcrowding, three stages,

00:44:54.040 --> 00:44:57.355
20 or so bands during
a day long rock concert

00:44:57.355 --> 00:44:59.260
that we call Feedback.

00:44:59.260 --> 00:45:02.940
And it is the most fun
I have all year long.

00:45:02.940 --> 00:45:04.360
It's during the
South by Southwest

00:45:04.360 --> 00:45:07.780
music festival in Austin
and that is my Christmas.

00:45:07.780 --> 00:45:10.206
And we're doing interesting
things with that.

00:45:10.206 --> 00:45:11.330
I have to leave it at that.

00:45:11.330 --> 00:45:13.190
But we're doing some
interesting things with that.

00:45:13.190 --> 00:45:14.565
AUDIENCE: One
follow-up question,

00:45:14.565 --> 00:45:18.670
as a follow record player owner,
what is your favorite record?

00:45:18.670 --> 00:45:19.300
"Hunky Dory."

00:45:19.300 --> 00:45:22.150
David Bowie is probably
my favorite single artist.

00:45:22.150 --> 00:45:24.340
We have an enormous
Beatles collection.

00:45:24.340 --> 00:45:27.040
The one that's most special
to both my husband and myself

00:45:27.040 --> 00:45:30.430
is our "Sergeant Pepper's"
that's signed by Ringo.

00:45:30.430 --> 00:45:32.695
Again, I almost
burst into tears.

00:45:32.695 --> 00:45:34.930
Because he did it the
day he was on our show

00:45:34.930 --> 00:45:36.670
and he doesn't sign
anything, you know?

00:45:36.670 --> 00:45:39.050
And my husband was telling
him that his first word was

00:45:39.050 --> 00:45:41.390
more because he had the
"Sergeant Pepper's mono

00:45:41.390 --> 00:45:45.560
playing on his little
toddler record player.

00:45:45.560 --> 00:45:47.900
And his mom wanted him
to come to the table

00:45:47.900 --> 00:45:50.736
and sit in his high chair and
eat dinner with the family.

00:45:50.736 --> 00:45:52.610
And she took the record
off and he got so mad

00:45:52.610 --> 00:45:54.450
he screamed, more, and
that's his first word

00:45:54.450 --> 00:45:56.390
and he ripped the cover.

00:45:56.390 --> 00:45:58.110
And Ringo made fun
of him and said,

00:45:58.110 --> 00:46:00.530
you know, I could have brought
you a fresh one of this

00:46:00.530 --> 00:46:02.040
and he signed it for him.

00:46:02.040 --> 00:46:03.860
But the idea that it's
John's first word,

00:46:03.860 --> 00:46:06.110
that I ever got to
meet a Beatle, I mean,

00:46:06.110 --> 00:46:08.120
it makes me want to
burst into tears.

00:46:08.120 --> 00:46:10.470
My first word was vino,
no big surprise there.

00:46:10.470 --> 00:46:11.390
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:11.390 --> 00:46:13.880
My Grandpa made wine and
he used to babysit me

00:46:13.880 --> 00:46:16.220
when I was little because
my mom was in the restaurant

00:46:16.220 --> 00:46:17.660
and I hated formula.

00:46:17.660 --> 00:46:19.550
My mom raised me on formula.

00:46:19.550 --> 00:46:21.410
So he used to put
water and a little

00:46:21.410 --> 00:46:23.020
of his homemade
wine and my bottle

00:46:23.020 --> 00:46:25.730
and he'd hold the bottle
up and go, vino, vino.

00:46:25.730 --> 00:46:28.347
And I would drink that and
then my cheeks would get rosy

00:46:28.347 --> 00:46:29.180
and I'd go to sleep.

00:46:29.180 --> 00:46:31.220
So I was the good baby, right?

00:46:31.220 --> 00:46:33.890
But he would hold up my
bottle and I thought,

00:46:33.890 --> 00:46:35.505
that's how you said
ba-ba was vino.

00:46:35.505 --> 00:46:36.380
ASIA SEAVERS: Oh, no.

00:46:36.380 --> 00:46:37.880
RACHAEL RAY: There's
a picture of me

00:46:37.880 --> 00:46:40.580
in one of those stick the high
chair on the edge of the table.

00:46:40.580 --> 00:46:41.630
They stopped selling
them because they

00:46:41.630 --> 00:46:42.685
killed so many people.

00:46:42.685 --> 00:46:42.960
ASIA SEAVERS: Oh.

00:46:42.960 --> 00:46:45.450
RACHAEL RAY: But I'm in one
of those hook on high chairs.

00:46:45.450 --> 00:46:47.180
It's an old Polaroid
and on the back

00:46:47.180 --> 00:46:49.700
it says, Rachael's
first word, vino.

00:46:49.700 --> 00:46:51.950
And it's me holding my
hand up from my ba-ba,

00:46:51.950 --> 00:46:54.162
but it looks like
I'm a drunk at a bar.

00:46:54.162 --> 00:46:55.280
So funny.

00:46:55.280 --> 00:46:58.220
So my husband, more, mine, vino.

00:46:58.220 --> 00:46:58.920
More vino.

00:46:58.920 --> 00:47:01.515
That's we got married in
Tuscany in a vineyard.

00:47:01.515 --> 00:47:03.140
ASIA SEAVERS: That
makes so much sense.

00:47:03.140 --> 00:47:03.560
Oh, my god.

00:47:03.560 --> 00:47:03.770
Mind blown.

00:47:03.770 --> 00:47:05.728
RACHAEL RAY: Anyway, that
was a great question.

00:47:05.728 --> 00:47:07.661
Thank you.

00:47:07.661 --> 00:47:09.660
AUDIENCE: Thank you so
much for coming in today.

00:47:09.660 --> 00:47:11.076
Really cool way
to start the week.

00:47:11.076 --> 00:47:12.335
RACHAEL RAY: Oh, thank you.

00:47:12.335 --> 00:47:13.710
AUDIENCE: So I'm
hosting my first

00:47:13.710 --> 00:47:17.010
ever Thanksgiving this
year for around 25 people,

00:47:17.010 --> 00:47:19.104
and I was wondering
if you had advice on--

00:47:19.104 --> 00:47:20.145
RACHAEL RAY: I have lots.

00:47:20.145 --> 00:47:21.030
AUDIENCE: Oh, great.

00:47:21.030 --> 00:47:23.205
I was onto the side dish
that you would recommend

00:47:23.205 --> 00:47:25.404
and any general advice
would be awesome.

00:47:25.404 --> 00:47:27.070
RACHAEL RAY: For the
turkeys themselves,

00:47:27.070 --> 00:47:28.412
you're doing the whole thing?

00:47:28.412 --> 00:47:30.495
AUDIENCE: I'm outsourcing
the turkey to my parents

00:47:30.495 --> 00:47:32.072
but I'm going to do the rest.

00:47:32.072 --> 00:47:33.780
RACHAEL RAY: See, now
I wouldn't do that.

00:47:33.780 --> 00:47:34.863
The turkey is the easiest.

00:47:34.863 --> 00:47:37.440
But let me tell you
my top turkey tips

00:47:37.440 --> 00:47:41.040
in case you're brave enough to
do the actual birds next time.

00:47:41.040 --> 00:47:42.420
It's a funny term.

00:47:42.420 --> 00:47:43.670
It's an old English term.

00:47:43.670 --> 00:47:48.120
Spatchcocking is when you take
the backbone out of any poultry

00:47:48.120 --> 00:47:49.620
and make it flat.

00:47:49.620 --> 00:47:51.990
And I never make one big bird.

00:47:51.990 --> 00:47:56.239
It's impossible to successfully
cook one large bird

00:47:56.239 --> 00:47:57.780
and you should do
a pound per person,

00:47:57.780 --> 00:47:59.280
so that'd be a 25-pound bird.

00:47:59.280 --> 00:48:01.110
That's a big bird.

00:48:01.110 --> 00:48:03.774
So we spatchcocked the
birds for even cooking.

00:48:03.774 --> 00:48:05.190
So the white meat
in the dark meat

00:48:05.190 --> 00:48:07.080
cooked at the exact same time.

00:48:07.080 --> 00:48:10.440
And always, no matter how
many people I'm cooking for,

00:48:10.440 --> 00:48:12.270
I do birds there
are 12 to 14 pounds

00:48:12.270 --> 00:48:14.070
and then multiples of them.

00:48:14.070 --> 00:48:18.060
So you do two birds is what I
would recommend for you guys,

00:48:18.060 --> 00:48:20.400
flattened, on a rock.

00:48:20.400 --> 00:48:23.790
It cuts your cooking
time down to a third.

00:48:23.790 --> 00:48:25.890
It cooks perfectly
evenly and you

00:48:25.890 --> 00:48:27.960
can platter one on a
giant cutting board

00:48:27.960 --> 00:48:29.400
and carve the other
one completely

00:48:29.400 --> 00:48:30.870
before you even sit down.

00:48:30.870 --> 00:48:33.810
So there's one you can
decorate and it stays pretty

00:48:33.810 --> 00:48:35.730
till everybody's
seated at least.

00:48:35.730 --> 00:48:40.110
Side dishes, we have
millions on the website

00:48:40.110 --> 00:48:43.350
and of course on the show site.

00:48:43.350 --> 00:48:46.260
We have literally
over a decade of them.

00:48:46.260 --> 00:48:49.830
But I think generally
speaking, roast vegetables

00:48:49.830 --> 00:48:52.470
are very simple for people.

00:48:52.470 --> 00:48:54.600
Cauliflower, whole
heads of cauliflower

00:48:54.600 --> 00:48:57.240
are very showy and
very simple to master.

00:48:57.240 --> 00:48:59.010
We have tons of
recipes for them.

00:48:59.010 --> 00:49:00.660
They look like
giant brains and you

00:49:00.660 --> 00:49:03.270
can do like three giant
whole roast cauliflowers

00:49:03.270 --> 00:49:06.150
and you cut them like cake
and it looks really fancy.

00:49:06.150 --> 00:49:08.430
You can pour Welsh
rarebit sauce over them

00:49:08.430 --> 00:49:10.050
or lots of ricotta
and parmigiano

00:49:10.050 --> 00:49:11.850
and garlic all over them.

00:49:11.850 --> 00:49:13.410
And it just looks cool.

00:49:13.410 --> 00:49:16.770
Roast vegetables are
your easiest bet.

00:49:16.770 --> 00:49:19.140
Mashed potatoes hold
all day in a bain-marie

00:49:19.140 --> 00:49:21.570
and you can make those
interesting by doing

00:49:21.570 --> 00:49:24.090
a third of the weight
in parsnip, which is

00:49:24.090 --> 00:49:25.710
like a carrot with an attitude.

00:49:25.710 --> 00:49:28.680
Parsnip and potato
together and then mixing

00:49:28.680 --> 00:49:32.790
in a surprising flavor, boursin
soft cheese and garlic and herb

00:49:32.790 --> 00:49:35.970
or super sharp cheddar and
nutmeg and a little cayenne

00:49:35.970 --> 00:49:37.650
pepper.

00:49:37.650 --> 00:49:38.970
That's always a big hit.

00:49:38.970 --> 00:49:41.790
People love the mashed potatoes.

00:49:41.790 --> 00:49:44.160
I rarely make gravy
out of the pan stock.

00:49:44.160 --> 00:49:47.870
I'll add a little bit but I
always make gallons of gravy.

00:49:47.870 --> 00:49:50.350
And I do that with store
bought turkey stock.

00:49:50.350 --> 00:49:53.174
And the way I deepen the flavor
of my gravy and the color

00:49:53.174 --> 00:49:55.590
is with Worcestershire sauce
rather than that gravy liquid

00:49:55.590 --> 00:49:57.540
stuff.

00:49:57.540 --> 00:49:58.970
On and on and on.

00:49:58.970 --> 00:50:01.650
Baked pastas are always
popular with people.

00:50:01.650 --> 00:50:03.750
Pumpkin soup is such
an easy starter.

00:50:03.750 --> 00:50:05.740
Deviled eggs, people love.

00:50:05.740 --> 00:50:08.880
I always do stuffed eggs
to start the course.

00:50:08.880 --> 00:50:12.870
Everybody loves them
and they're so easy.

00:50:12.870 --> 00:50:15.750
But honestly, I got
you covered on this.

00:50:15.750 --> 00:50:18.810
Go to our web sites and just
put in Thanksgiving sides.

00:50:18.810 --> 00:50:20.940
You'll be able to
download a ream--

00:50:20.940 --> 00:50:22.860
like 500-- recipes.

00:50:22.860 --> 00:50:23.610
AUDIENCE: Awesome.

00:50:23.610 --> 00:50:24.109
Thank you.

00:50:24.109 --> 00:50:25.670
And maybe I'll give
the turkey a try.

00:50:25.670 --> 00:50:26.586
RACHAEL RAY: OK, good.

00:50:30.010 --> 00:50:30.930
AUDIENCE: Hi, Rachael.

00:50:30.930 --> 00:50:32.525
Thanks again for being here.

00:50:32.525 --> 00:50:33.900
RACHAEL RAY: Thanks
for having me

00:50:33.900 --> 00:50:36.150
AUDIENCE: I have a bit
of a silly question

00:50:36.150 --> 00:50:37.240
but I'm really curious.

00:50:37.240 --> 00:50:38.676
RACHAEL RAY: I'm a silly
person, so that's--

00:50:38.676 --> 00:50:39.430
AUDIENCE: Great.

00:50:39.430 --> 00:50:43.140
So when Beyonce's "Lemonade"
came out, there were some--

00:50:43.140 --> 00:50:45.535
RACHAEL RAY: Oh, I was
in bad news once, right?

00:50:45.535 --> 00:50:47.890
The most preposterous thing
in the world, that I even

00:50:47.890 --> 00:50:49.027
know Jay Z is ridiculous.

00:50:49.027 --> 00:50:49.860
ASIA SEAVERS: Right.

00:50:49.860 --> 00:50:50.650
Oh, no.

00:50:50.650 --> 00:50:53.620
RACHAEL RAY: But anyway, I
barely had an awareness of it

00:50:53.620 --> 00:50:55.160
until I went to
work the next day.

00:50:55.160 --> 00:50:57.470
And all of the young people that
worked for me told me about it.

00:50:57.470 --> 00:50:58.970
But I just thought
it was hilarious.

00:50:58.970 --> 00:51:00.390
And I was kind of thrilled.

00:51:00.390 --> 00:51:04.630
I sent Rachel Roy some flowers
and apologized to her, though.

00:51:04.630 --> 00:51:07.030
AUDIENCE: Does everybody
know what I'm referring to?

00:51:07.030 --> 00:51:08.780
Maybe you want to tell
them what happened.

00:51:08.780 --> 00:51:10.950
RACHAEL RAY: No, you
can go right ahead.

00:51:10.950 --> 00:51:14.650
Somehow, it was rumored
that Rachel Roy,

00:51:14.650 --> 00:51:17.770
the super tall, gorgeous
fashion designer lady

00:51:17.770 --> 00:51:19.930
got mixed up with
me, Rachael Ray,

00:51:19.930 --> 00:51:22.450
and that they were rumored
to have been having

00:51:22.450 --> 00:51:26.680
a fling, Jay Z and her, not me.

00:51:26.680 --> 00:51:29.110
So somehow, I got into
this and all these people

00:51:29.110 --> 00:51:31.930
were zapping me with their
stingers or something,

00:51:31.930 --> 00:51:33.210
all hating on me.

00:51:33.210 --> 00:51:36.170
I'm like, I think that's really
flattering that anybody even

00:51:36.170 --> 00:51:39.220
thinks I'm in that room.

00:51:39.220 --> 00:51:42.670
I'm home in my King Kong
slippers making John spaghetti.

00:51:42.670 --> 00:51:46.490
The idea that I could even be
in the room with those people.

00:51:46.490 --> 00:51:47.830
Come on.

00:51:47.830 --> 00:51:49.627
Please.

00:51:49.627 --> 00:51:52.085
AUDIENCE: Which leads me to
the second half of my question.

00:51:52.085 --> 00:51:54.210
It's how much were
you aware of what--

00:51:54.210 --> 00:51:55.210
RACHAEL RAY: Not at all.

00:51:55.210 --> 00:51:55.760
AUDIENCE: --on social media.

00:51:55.760 --> 00:51:56.510
RACHAEL RAY: Zero.

00:51:56.510 --> 00:51:57.220
Zippo.

00:51:57.220 --> 00:51:58.120
Zilch-o.

00:51:58.120 --> 00:52:00.070
But thank you for reminding
me that one time I

00:52:00.070 --> 00:52:01.840
was by accident cool.

00:52:01.840 --> 00:52:03.550
[LAUGHTER]

00:52:03.550 --> 00:52:06.660
Cool enough to be
gossiped about.

00:52:06.660 --> 00:52:07.415
Yeah.

00:52:07.415 --> 00:52:10.300
I was cool enough to be in
the room once by mistake.

00:52:10.300 --> 00:52:11.642
[LAUGHS]

00:52:11.642 --> 00:52:12.850
ASIA SEAVERS: That's perfect.

00:52:12.850 --> 00:52:14.066
That was funny.

00:52:14.066 --> 00:52:14.740
RACHAEL RAY: Hi.

00:52:14.740 --> 00:52:15.240
Hello.

00:52:15.240 --> 00:52:17.640
AUDIENCE: Rachael, so with
the past 10 or 15 years,

00:52:17.640 --> 00:52:20.090
we've seen people care
more about local food,

00:52:20.090 --> 00:52:20.700
organic food--

00:52:20.700 --> 00:52:21.170
RACHAEL RAY: Absolutely.

00:52:21.170 --> 00:52:22.420
AUDIENCE: --and natural stuff.

00:52:22.420 --> 00:52:24.310
So what other trends
do you see going

00:52:24.310 --> 00:52:28.134
into the future, or some new
things people are trying?

00:52:28.134 --> 00:52:30.550
RACHAEL RAY: I think it goes
back to that awareness thing,

00:52:30.550 --> 00:52:33.970
just that everybody's having
the conversation about it.

00:52:33.970 --> 00:52:37.030
What I hope people do is take
it to the local government

00:52:37.030 --> 00:52:38.500
and grassroots level.

00:52:38.500 --> 00:52:40.840
Unfortunately, a lot of
the work that I put in

00:52:40.840 --> 00:52:44.470
over the last eight years,
lobbying literally physically

00:52:44.470 --> 00:52:47.050
in person in Washington and
improving the quality of school

00:52:47.050 --> 00:52:49.000
food has just been ripped out.

00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:51.250
Although Mayor de
Blasio in New York City,

00:52:51.250 --> 00:52:54.040
I'm so proud to say,
as of last Thursday,

00:52:54.040 --> 00:52:56.020
no more food shaming in
the city of New York.

00:52:56.020 --> 00:53:00.170
Every child now has equal access
to school lunch in New York,

00:53:00.170 --> 00:53:02.357
which is amazing and
that's a huge thing.

00:53:02.357 --> 00:53:03.940
What I would love
people to not only--

00:53:03.940 --> 00:53:04.180
[APPLAUSE]

00:53:04.180 --> 00:53:04.840
I agree.

00:53:04.840 --> 00:53:07.160
It's a very, very,
very big deal.

00:53:07.160 --> 00:53:11.490
But I would love to see people
take what they like about food

00:53:11.490 --> 00:53:15.330
or what they've learned about
it and share with younger people

00:53:15.330 --> 00:53:17.220
and people in their
community and care

00:53:17.220 --> 00:53:19.680
about the quality of food
of their neighbors, not just

00:53:19.680 --> 00:53:21.000
themselves.

00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:24.270
I think that everybody now
has the knowledge to do that

00:53:24.270 --> 00:53:27.000
and when you see
natural disasters,

00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:29.232
understand that there
is always a disaster,

00:53:29.232 --> 00:53:31.190
whether you live in a
small town or a big city.

00:53:31.190 --> 00:53:34.320
There's a food bank
everywhere that you

00:53:34.320 --> 00:53:39.810
should be giving of your time
and your money or both or food

00:53:39.810 --> 00:53:42.329
to those around you and
educating each other,

00:53:42.329 --> 00:53:43.620
talking to each other about it.

00:53:43.620 --> 00:53:45.356
Because we have to
build that network.

00:53:45.356 --> 00:53:46.730
I don't even have
human children.

00:53:46.730 --> 00:53:47.670
I have a pit bull.

00:53:47.670 --> 00:53:50.370
But I care about the quality
of school food and access

00:53:50.370 --> 00:53:53.040
to food because I care
about health care costs,

00:53:53.040 --> 00:53:56.370
because I care about the
ability of children to learn,

00:53:56.370 --> 00:54:00.510
because they're going to grow up
and become the next generation

00:54:00.510 --> 00:54:02.940
of everything for us.

00:54:02.940 --> 00:54:05.190
I need them to be
healthy and smart.

00:54:05.190 --> 00:54:06.900
So I'm hoping that
what comes out

00:54:06.900 --> 00:54:10.710
of everybody getting more social
and sharing with each other

00:54:10.710 --> 00:54:13.200
and coming up with all these
alternatives for no matter

00:54:13.200 --> 00:54:16.560
what type of lifestyle you
want to live that they also

00:54:16.560 --> 00:54:19.320
take the time to share
that with each other

00:54:19.320 --> 00:54:22.590
and be mindful of giving
back to their community.

00:54:22.590 --> 00:54:25.050
I think the last
hurdle for young people

00:54:25.050 --> 00:54:28.200
is because of social media,
everybody is also very vision.

00:54:28.200 --> 00:54:31.170
We don't socialize in
person as much as we should.

00:54:31.170 --> 00:54:35.080
We don't spend as much time
in the community as we should.

00:54:35.080 --> 00:54:37.800
I think that we need
to be mindful of that,

00:54:37.800 --> 00:54:41.640
not to be so closed-in
and only communicating

00:54:41.640 --> 00:54:42.780
with each other like this.

00:54:42.780 --> 00:54:45.870
To go out and spend
time with actual people

00:54:45.870 --> 00:54:48.030
and share with them
I think is important.

00:54:48.030 --> 00:54:51.000
What I'd like people to do
with food and anything else

00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:55.200
that they have to offer is
to be more community-minded.

00:54:55.200 --> 00:54:56.196
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:54:56.196 --> 00:54:56.870
ASIA SEAVERS: Any
more questions?

00:54:56.870 --> 00:54:58.328
RACHAEL RAY: Wow,
that was serious.

00:54:58.328 --> 00:55:00.540
[LAUGHTER]

00:55:00.540 --> 00:55:02.870
ASIA SEAVERS: Do we have
any other questions?

00:55:02.870 --> 00:55:03.670
No?

00:55:03.670 --> 00:55:04.560
RACHAEL RAY: All right,
think we can all just

00:55:04.560 --> 00:55:05.640
do the staring contest.

00:55:05.640 --> 00:55:07.745
ASIA SEAVERS: We can but
we're actually on time.

00:55:07.745 --> 00:55:08.930
RACHAEL RAY: Oh,
we're on time, yay!

00:55:08.930 --> 00:55:09.418
ASIA SEAVERS:
Whoop, whoop, whoop.

00:55:09.418 --> 00:55:10.126
RACHAEL RAY: Woo!

00:55:10.126 --> 00:55:11.370
ASIA SEAVERS: Oh, yeah.

00:55:11.370 --> 00:55:12.910
So thank you so much, Rachael.

00:55:12.910 --> 00:55:13.850
Let's give a hand for Rachael.

00:55:13.850 --> 00:55:14.320
RACHAEL RAY: Thank you.

00:55:14.320 --> 00:55:14.986
Thank you, guys.

00:55:14.986 --> 00:55:16.200
[APPLAUSE]

00:55:16.200 --> 00:55:17.610
I hope that was fun for you.

00:55:17.610 --> 00:55:18.080
ASIA SEAVERS: It was.

00:55:18.080 --> 00:55:18.830
I had so much fun.

00:55:18.830 --> 00:55:21.010
RACHAEL RAY:
Certainly fun for me.

00:55:21.010 --> 00:55:22.900
Today's my mother
in law's birthday.

00:55:22.900 --> 00:55:25.090
That's rough, of course,
to have your birthday

00:55:25.090 --> 00:55:28.180
on a very somber occasion.

00:55:28.180 --> 00:55:30.534
But it's our family
business tonight

00:55:30.534 --> 00:55:32.700
to go out and make her feel
special for a few hours.

00:55:32.700 --> 00:55:33.408
ASIA SEAVERS: OK.

00:55:33.408 --> 00:55:35.644
RACHAEL RAY: So I'm going
to go do exactly what she'd

00:55:35.644 --> 00:55:37.810
want me to do and have a
glass of wine before dinner

00:55:37.810 --> 00:55:39.310
and get myself in the mood.

00:55:39.310 --> 00:55:40.060
Thanks, everybody.

00:55:40.060 --> 00:55:41.380
I really appreciate being here.

00:55:41.380 --> 00:55:41.880
Thank you.

00:55:41.880 --> 00:55:42.320
ASIA SEAVERS: Thank you.

00:55:42.320 --> 00:55:42.920
[APPLAUSE]

00:55:42.920 --> 00:55:43.820
RACHAEL RAY: Thanks, AJ.

00:55:43.820 --> 00:55:45.361
ASIA SEAVERS: No,
thank you, Rachael.

00:55:45.361 --> 00:55:48.070
RACHAEL RAY: You're such a
cutie pie and I love that--
