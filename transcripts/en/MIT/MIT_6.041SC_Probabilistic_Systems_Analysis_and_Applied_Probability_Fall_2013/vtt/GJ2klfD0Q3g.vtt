00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.770
 

00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:01.540
Hi.

00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:04.980
In this video, we're going to
compute some useful quantities

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.520
for the exponential
random variable.

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:12.230
So we're given that x is
exponential with rate lambda.

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:16.050
PDF looks like this, and
the formula is here.

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:19.770
First question, part
a, what's the CDF?

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.495
So let's go right in.

00:00:23.495 --> 00:00:28.350
The CDF of x is the probability
that X is less

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:30.590
than or equal to little x.

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:33.090
Let's look at some cases here.

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.340
What if little x
is less than 0?

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.770
Well, x random variable
only takes on these

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:41.670
non-negative values.

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.710
And so the probability that X is
less than or equal to some

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:49.155
negative number is
going to be 0.

00:00:49.155 --> 00:00:52.080
On the other hand, if x is
greater than or equal to 0, we

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:54.490
do actually have to
integrate here.

00:00:54.490 --> 00:01:00.800
So to do that, we take the
integral from minus infinity

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.390
to x of fx of t--

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.570
the dummy variable
here used is t.

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:12.080
Notice that again, fx of t is
going to be 0 for negative

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:17.310
values, so we take the
integral here from 0.

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.205
And now we plug in
for fx of t.

00:01:22.205 --> 00:01:25.760
That's minus lambda t dt.

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:32.970
And recall that the integral
of u to the a t is 1 over a

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.425
times e to the a t.

00:01:34.425 --> 00:01:37.020
So here in this case,
we'll get lambda,

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:37.900
which is just a constant.

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:40.610
And then a here is going
to be negative lambda.

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:46.060
So we get this, 0 to x.

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:50.520
Lambdas cancel and we actually
get 1 minus e to the

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.600
minus lambda x.

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.310
 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:57.760
So do this.

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:59.150
And we are done with the CDF.

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:01.700
 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:03.630
Now for the expectation.

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:13.520
We use the standard formula,
which is minus infinity to

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:20.250
infinity t times fx of t dt.

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.410
So again, fx of t is going to
be 0 for a negative value.

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:28.670
So we do the integral from 0.

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:37.130
We get 0 to infinity t lambda
e to the minus lambda t dt.

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:41.700
Now, you can try all you want
to get rid of this t.

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.850
It's not going to go even if
you try all kinds of u

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:44.740
substitution.

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:49.050
But at the end the day, you're
going to have to pull out your

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:53.380
calculus textbook and find
the integration by parts

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:55.863
formula, which is--

00:02:55.863 --> 00:03:04.340
 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:05.590
v du.

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:07.630
 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:10.370
So the hope is that this
integral is going to be easier

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:12.170
than the one on the left.

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:15.603
Notice that this is the
integral of one

00:03:15.603 --> 00:03:17.100
of the terms here.

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:18.880
And this is the derivative
of one of the terms.

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:22.780
So that may help you decide
on how you select u and v.

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:27.310
In our case actually, I'm
going to use u as--

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:28.490
t for u.

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:30.860
Because when you take
the derivative, it's

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:31.780
going to become 1.

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:34.175
And the derivative is what's
going to go in that integral.

00:03:34.175 --> 00:03:38.100
 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:40.290
So this is going to
be dt for du.

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:43.140
And then, dv I'm going
to select as

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:43.930
whatever's left over.

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:47.130
It's lambda e to minus
lambda t dt.

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:49.070
So v is going to be--

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:50.490
we already did the integral--

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:52.457
minus e to the minus lambda t.

00:03:52.457 --> 00:03:55.390
 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:04:01.740
And so if we do this, it's going
to be negative t times e

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:03.550
to the minus lambda t.

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:04.720
So that's uv.

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:08.240
Minus v, which is negative
e to the minus

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:11.430
lambda t times dt.

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:13.310
That goes from 0 to infinity.

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:17.529
This is evaluated from
0 to infinity.

00:04:17.529 --> 00:04:19.990
Well, what does it mean
for this to be

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:22.300
evaluated from 0 to infinity?

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:25.640
A better and easier way to look
at this is to say, well,

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:27.890
it's going to go from 0 to x.

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:31.960
But then you take the limit
as x goes to infinity.

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:34.540
So that's going to
help us here.

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:35.860
And this negative--

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:37.310
these negatives cancel.

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:39.040
And we're left with--

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:42.280
let's plug in the bounds.

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:51.010
We're left with negative x
minus lambda x plus the

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:56.610
integral of this is going to be
1 over negative lambda e to

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:03.050
the minus lambda t evaluated
from 0 to infinity.

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:07.210
All right, so now the limit.

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:11.490
So for the limit, notice
that x increases

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:14.140
as x goes to infinity.

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:17.650
And this exponential decays.

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:19.890
So they're kind of competing
for each other.

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:22.830
But the exponential is going to
win because it decays way

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:24.160
faster than x.

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:27.580
And so this first term
is going to go off--

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:29.490
the limit is going to go to 0.

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:36.930
 

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:37.820
All right.

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:40.582
For this, if you evaluate
the balance, the

00:05:40.582 --> 00:05:42.750
infinity makes this 0.

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:47.650
And 0, you're going to
get 1 over lambda.

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:49.520
So that's 1 over lambda.

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:50.340
All right.

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:55.900
And so the expectation
is 1 over lambda.

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:59.290
OK, so now what's
the variance?

00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:01.750
That's part c, right?

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:11.710
So we use the standard formula
for variance, which is this.

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:15.930
 

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:17.640
We already figured out
the expectation.

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:21.380
We just need to figure out the
expectation of x squared.

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:24.850
Well, we're just going to follow
the same set of steps

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:25.710
from before.

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:29.360
For x squared, it's just going
to be t squared, t squared, t

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:31.010
squared, x squared.

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:36.680
The only thing that's going to
change is what we choose for u

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:37.920
here, for the u substitution.

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:40.310
So it's going to be t squared.

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:43.530
So the derivative is going
to change to 2t dt.

00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:45.880
v is going to be exactly
the same.

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:51.160
And so here in this term, we
get negative 2t e to the

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:54.410
minus lambda t.

00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:56.660
But there's a negative sign
out here, so the negatives

00:06:56.660 --> 00:07:01.460
cancel and we're left with
a positive sign here.

00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:04.120
This is going to change.

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:06.450
All right.

00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:07.190
OK.

00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:10.840
So in order to do this integral,
we can use a trick.

00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:12.830
We can move this--

00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:14.090
so there's a 2t here.

00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:17.710
We move this 2 in here,
leave the t inside.

00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:20.200
And you have to leave
the t inside.

00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:24.530
But multiply by lambda
and divide by lambda.

00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:27.050
 

00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:28.750
Now, look at that integral.

00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:32.870
0 to infinity t times lambda
e to the minus lambda t dt.

00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:36.200
Exactly the expectation
that we computed.

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:37.622
We already did that.

00:07:37.622 --> 00:07:42.260
That is just 1 over lambda, so
it's 2 over lambda times 1

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:43.900
over lambda.

00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:47.350
Again, the limit as x
goes to infinity--

00:07:47.350 --> 00:07:51.180
the exponential will
beat x squared.

00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:53.810
No matter what polynomial
we put in there, the

00:07:53.810 --> 00:07:56.070
exponential's going to win.

00:07:56.070 --> 00:07:59.320
So this is going
to be 0 still.

00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:02.760
This one's going to be 2
over lambda squared.

00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:06.590
So we're left with 2 over lambda
squared for expectation

00:08:06.590 --> 00:08:09.700
of x squared.

00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:17.170
And so we have 1 over lambda
squared for the variance.

00:08:17.170 --> 00:08:19.265
OK, so we're done with
the variance.

00:08:19.265 --> 00:08:23.980
 

00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:25.710
Part d.

00:08:25.710 --> 00:08:31.580
We're given that x1, x2, and
x3 are independent and

00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:32.669
identically distributed.

00:08:32.669 --> 00:08:34.659
They're exponentials
with rate lambda.

00:08:34.659 --> 00:08:37.690
We're asked for the PDF
of z, which is the max

00:08:37.690 --> 00:08:39.809
of x1, x2, and x2.

00:08:39.809 --> 00:08:42.610
How do we generally
find a PDF?

00:08:42.610 --> 00:08:47.100
We take the CDF and then take
the derivative, right?

00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:49.920
We first find the CDF, and
then take the derivative.

00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:54.110
So let's do that.

00:08:54.110 --> 00:08:56.300
So first, let's see.

00:08:56.300 --> 00:09:02.540
Part d, find the CDF of z,
which is going to be the

00:09:02.540 --> 00:09:06.330
probability that Z is less than
or equal to little z,

00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:09.330
which is going to be equal to
the probability that the max

00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:15.680
of x1, x2, x3 is less
than or equal to z.

00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:17.910
And this is going to have
the same sort of

00:09:17.910 --> 00:09:18.920
structure as before.

00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:23.800
If z is less than 0, x1,
x2, x3 are positive--

00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:24.650
non-negative.

00:09:24.650 --> 00:09:28.380
And so this is the probability
that if you get little z less

00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:31.850
than 0, you're not going to have
any probability there.

00:09:31.850 --> 00:09:36.630
And so if z is greater than or
equal to 0 is where it gets

00:09:36.630 --> 00:09:37.680
interesting.

00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:38.930
We need to do something
special.

00:09:38.930 --> 00:09:45.570
 

00:09:45.570 --> 00:09:50.210
So the special thing here
is to recognize that the

00:09:50.210 --> 00:09:53.770
probability of the max being
less than or equal to z is

00:09:53.770 --> 00:09:58.545
actually also the probability
of each of these random

00:09:58.545 --> 00:10:02.000
variables individually being
less than or equal to z.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.510
Why is that true?

00:10:04.510 --> 00:10:07.200
One way to check whether the
events-- these two events are

00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:11.170
the same is to check
the two directions.

00:10:11.170 --> 00:10:14.512
One direction say, if the max of
x1, x2, x3 is less than or

00:10:14.512 --> 00:10:18.400
equal to z, does that mean x1 is
less than or equal to z, x2

00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:19.730
is less than or equal
to z, and x3 is less

00:10:19.730 --> 00:10:21.050
than or equal to z?

00:10:21.050 --> 00:10:21.640
Yes.

00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:22.600
OK.

00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:26.116
And then, if x1, x2, and x3 are
individually less than or

00:10:26.116 --> 00:10:29.870
equal to z, then the max is also
less than or equal to z.

00:10:29.870 --> 00:10:35.950
So these two events are
equivalent and this is true.

00:10:35.950 --> 00:10:37.800
By independence we can
break this up.

00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:47.720
 

00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:49.660
And we get--

00:10:49.660 --> 00:10:53.050
these are all CDFs of the
exponential and they

00:10:53.050 --> 00:10:54.500
all have this form.

00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:57.030
So it's just going to
be 1 minus e to the

00:10:57.030 --> 00:11:02.370
minus lambda z cubed.

00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:03.620
Plug this in here.

00:11:03.620 --> 00:11:07.990
 

00:11:07.990 --> 00:11:10.550
And then, try to take the
derivative to get the PDF.

00:11:10.550 --> 00:11:21.530
 

00:11:21.530 --> 00:11:21.940
Let's see.

00:11:21.940 --> 00:11:28.250
So it's going to be the same,
like this for z less than 0.

00:11:28.250 --> 00:11:30.700
For z greater than or equal
to 0, it's going to be the

00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:32.700
derivative of this thing.

00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:38.080
Derivative of this thing is by
chain rule, 3 times 1 minus e

00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:40.980
to the minus lambda z squared.

00:11:40.980 --> 00:11:43.360
Then the derivative of negative
e to the minus lambda

00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:49.040
z, that's just lambda e
to the minus lambda z.

00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:51.370
There we go.

00:11:51.370 --> 00:11:54.710
This is the PDF we
were looking for.

00:11:54.710 --> 00:11:55.850
So last problem.

00:11:55.850 --> 00:11:58.240
We're looking for the PDF
of w, which is the

00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:00.770
min of x1 and x2.

00:12:00.770 --> 00:12:03.830
So let's try this as
a similar approach.

00:12:03.830 --> 00:12:05.670
Try the same thing, actually.

00:12:05.670 --> 00:12:06.920
See if it works.

00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:15.260
 

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:23.785
So w, w, w, w, min, less
than or equal to w.

00:12:23.785 --> 00:12:26.700
 

00:12:26.700 --> 00:12:27.720
OK.

00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:28.970
So let's see if this works.

00:12:28.970 --> 00:12:36.860
 

00:12:36.860 --> 00:12:39.250
Is it true that the min--

00:12:39.250 --> 00:12:45.360
if the min of x1 and x2 is less
than or equal to w, that

00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:47.910
each of them is less
than or equal to w?

00:12:47.910 --> 00:12:49.220
No, right?

00:12:49.220 --> 00:12:52.590
X1 could be less than or
equal to w and x2 could

00:12:52.590 --> 00:12:53.690
be bigger than w.

00:12:53.690 --> 00:12:57.682
And the min could still be
less than or equal to w.

00:12:57.682 --> 00:13:00.560
So that's definitely not true.

00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:04.310
So what do we do here?

00:13:04.310 --> 00:13:12.430
The trick is to flip it and say
we want to compute the min

00:13:12.430 --> 00:13:15.850
of x1 and x2 being
greater than w.

00:13:15.850 --> 00:13:20.860
In that case, let's check
if we can do this trick.

00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:26.420
 

00:13:26.420 --> 00:13:30.960
If the min of x1 and x2 is
greater than w, then clearly

00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:33.650
x1 is bigger than w and
x2 is bigger than w.

00:13:33.650 --> 00:13:36.405
And if x1 and x2 are
individually bigger than w,

00:13:36.405 --> 00:13:40.390
then clearly the min's
also bigger than w.

00:13:40.390 --> 00:13:41.600
So this works.

00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:43.390
And now we can use independence
as before.

00:13:43.390 --> 00:13:48.610
 

00:13:48.610 --> 00:13:51.860
And for this, this is just
1 minus the CDF here.

00:13:51.860 --> 00:13:54.790
So it's just going to be
e to the minus lambda

00:13:54.790 --> 00:13:59.950
w for each of them.

00:13:59.950 --> 00:14:03.020
But that's the same as e
to the minus lambda 2w.

00:14:03.020 --> 00:14:09.070
 

00:14:09.070 --> 00:14:12.140
Or e to the 2 lambda w.

00:14:12.140 --> 00:14:13.390
So it's going to be--

00:14:13.390 --> 00:14:18.330
 

00:14:18.330 --> 00:14:21.110
Notice the similarity between
this and this.

00:14:21.110 --> 00:14:24.350
 

00:14:24.350 --> 00:14:28.120
The only difference is this
has a 2 lambda in there.

00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:31.210
That means that w is an
exponential random variable

00:14:31.210 --> 00:14:34.260
with rate 2 lambda.

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:42.720
So then the PDF is going to be
an exponential, whatever it is

00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:45.260
for an exponential.

00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:48.280
Except with rate 2 lambda.

00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:55.470
 

00:14:55.470 --> 00:14:58.550
You can also take the derivative
of this and find

00:14:58.550 --> 00:15:00.950
that you get this.

00:15:00.950 --> 00:15:05.182
OK, so we're done with
the problems.

00:15:05.182 --> 00:15:08.590
We computed some interesting
quantities for the exponential

00:15:08.590 --> 00:15:10.650
random variable in this--
