00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:05.440
Hey,
what's going on it's Bill Burr and It's time for the Thursday afternoon,

2
00:00:05.441 --> 00:00:08.350
just before Friday,
Monday morning podcast.

3
00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:11.500
And I am checking in.

4
00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:13.260
<v 0>Okay.</v>

5
00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:18.090
<v 1>Argue you woo.
What's going on?
How's your week been going?
Aw,</v>

6
00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:22.400
Jesus.
That's wonderful.
That's fantastic.

7
00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:26.750
I'm out here in La.
It's overcast,
it's gloomy,
it's rainy,

8
00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:28.840
which is a good thing.

9
00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:32.140
Which was a good thing because we always need the fucking rain out here.

10
00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:35.860
And I'm so pissed at whoever the,
I don't know was the mayor,

11
00:00:35.861 --> 00:00:36.641
I don't know who it was,

12
00:00:36.641 --> 00:00:40.980
but last year it rained like it's never rained out here and this fucking asshole

13
00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:45.850
goes,
okay.
You know the drought officially over.
It's like it's never over.

14
00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:51.400
There was never supposed to be a city out here.
Okay.
So whatever we got,

15
00:00:51.401 --> 00:00:56.401
we need to conserve because who not fuck knows when it's going to rain again.

16
00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:02.270
So what do I see?
What do I see the other day?
I see this whole fucking thing,

17
00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:06.800
this video about how to put these giant black rubber balls.

18
00:01:06.801 --> 00:01:08.630
They just roll them into lakes,
I think.

19
00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:12.830
And I believe that it's to try to prevent,
you know,

20
00:01:12.831 --> 00:01:17.510
to slow down the evaporation of the water in the searing heat out here.

21
00:01:17.511 --> 00:01:18.410
And once again,

22
00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:22.520
this saying that we're in a drought and does anybody go back to the stupid ass

23
00:01:22.521 --> 00:01:25.760
fucking mayor or the governor or the lieutenant something,
whatever,

24
00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.970
whatever the fuck the person's position is that makes the ignorant statement

25
00:01:28.971 --> 00:01:31.800
that the drought is over.
So every stupid cards out here,

26
00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:34.610
it goes back to fucking take an extra long shower.

27
00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.980
Of course not.
Why would you do that?
Why would you do that?

28
00:01:40.981 --> 00:01:43.170
It's not your job as a politician.

29
00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.400
You job as a politician is not to tell people what's going on.

30
00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.390
It's to make people feel that everything is going to be okay.

31
00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:55.460
You make them feel like everything's going to be okay when,

32
00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:57.410
when everything isn't okay.

33
00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:00.860
And then you make people scared shitless when there's really nothing to be

34
00:02:00.861 --> 00:02:05.210
afraid of.
And that is my cynical fucking view on a cloudy fucking la morning.

35
00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:07.163
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

36
00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.210
<v 1>Oh,
these people are,
they're,
they're,
they're coming to get you.</v>

37
00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.710
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

38
00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:13.780
<v 1>Oh,
there's plenty of water.</v>

39
00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:18.670
Fucking take a nice long shower.
You stupid content.

40
00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:24.040
Um,
well that's not,
that's,
you know,
we're getting towards the end of the week.

41
00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.930
Why,
why,
why,
why,
why would I come at you?
So in this way,

42
00:02:28.931 --> 00:02:30.880
I'm a little grumpy today.
I'm a little grumpy.

43
00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:33.120
It didn't get a lot of sleep last night.
And then I got to,
uh,

44
00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:36.240
I'm going out to Pittsburgh today.
I've got Pittsburgh,

45
00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.160
I got Cincinnati this weekend too.

46
00:02:39.161 --> 00:02:43.510
Fucking towns and people ain't afraid to work lease or Dad's work and their

47
00:02:43.511 --> 00:02:46.570
dad's dad,
but these kids now and sitting around playing video games,

48
00:02:46.571 --> 00:02:50.260
trying to fucking come up with an APP that ain't steal working is,

49
00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:52.690
um,
I'm going out there.

50
00:02:52.691 --> 00:02:56.980
Some of my great friends that I've met in this business live in Pittsburgh.

51
00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:58.210
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

52
00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:00.580
<v 1>And,
uh,
so I'm to be doing tomorrow morning,</v>

53
00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:04.690
<v 0>I'm going to be on the,
uh,
the morning show,
Randy bombing and Bill Crawford,</v>

54
00:03:04.691 --> 00:03:09.070
wd Lee.
He so tune in if you're in Pittsburgh.
Um,

55
00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:11.110
I always try to make sure that I want to come back,

56
00:03:11.111 --> 00:03:13.180
that I do their show because I remember,

57
00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:17.530
I remember back in the day when I would go there and I would play the fucking

58
00:03:17.531 --> 00:03:21.190
Pittsburgh improv out at the stacks.

59
00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:25.060
This is small out there and they literally had the,
kept a stacks from,
you know,

60
00:03:25.061 --> 00:03:30.061
when we used to fucking produce shit in this country and for meal steel mills or

61
00:03:31.001 --> 00:03:35.980
whatever.
And uh,
I used to go down there and I'd sell low about 30,

62
00:03:35.981 --> 00:03:38.400
35 tickets.
Okay,

63
00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:42.160
<v 1>let me,
what's a fucking hard ticket to sell?
I can't explain it.</v>

64
00:03:42.161 --> 00:03:44.950
That God damn mall,
first of all,

65
00:03:44.951 --> 00:03:48.730
there was one way in and one way out on the skinny bridge,

66
00:03:48.731 --> 00:03:50.590
if I remember correctly.
And it took,

67
00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:54.300
it just took forever to get in and out of there.
And a,

68
00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:57.280
if nobody knew who the fuck you,
where it was very difficult to sell tickets.

69
00:03:57.281 --> 00:04:00.400
So a Randy used to put me on the show.
He'd be like,
dude,

70
00:04:00.401 --> 00:04:04.750
just come in Tuesday dude.
Do the fucking show every single day.

71
00:04:04.751 --> 00:04:08.650
Tuesday,
Wednesday,
Thursday,
Friday.
Come in.
I would do it.
Just sit in for the,

72
00:04:08.651 --> 00:04:11.890
almost the whole show,
all four days in a row.

73
00:04:11.891 --> 00:04:16.480
And then I finally started selling tickets.
So,
you know,

74
00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:18.340
now that I'm selling tickets,

75
00:04:18.341 --> 00:04:21.730
I don't want to come back to Pittsburgh like gold Billy big shot,
right?

76
00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:26.510
I gotta go back there and kiss the fucking ring.
They made me want I,

77
00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:28.240
why should you still shooting?
Um,

78
00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:30.490
and of course they're going to probably be fucking give me shit.

79
00:04:30.491 --> 00:04:35.491
I already already willing to believe that they're going to give me shit about

80
00:04:35.571 --> 00:04:39.350
the last patriots,
Steelers game,
those poor fuck at people.

81
00:04:39.351 --> 00:04:42.960
I can't remember the last time the Steelers beat the Patriots.
It's unbelievable.

82
00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.750
He used to beat the fuck out of us when we were kids.

83
00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:49.990
I'm just trying to enjoy the last fucking whatever Tom Brady has left because I

84
00:04:50.241 --> 00:04:51.920
know it's going to be,
it's like dolphin fence.

85
00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:53.700
They're still waiting for the next day.
Marina.

86
00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:59.790
They'd been waiting since 99 and entire generation has grown up watching them

87
00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:05.050
lose to the Patriots.
And my whole childhood,
I watched us lose to the dolphins.

88
00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:10.390
Bob fucking greasy,
right?
And then he finally retired like,
oh,

89
00:05:10.391 --> 00:05:11.380
thank God.
Right.

90
00:05:11.381 --> 00:05:15.300
And then somehow Don Shula's still got David Woodley and don Strock okay.

91
00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:18.610
To trade off at that position.

92
00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:19.910
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

93
00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:22.790
<v 1>And they went to another fucking Superbowl.
Granted they lost,</v>

94
00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:27.950
they still kicked our ass
and then they get Dan Marino.

95
00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:34.130
So our lives were fucking miserable for a good 17 years.
So,
uh,
you know what?

96
00:05:34.131 --> 00:05:35.120
That's an interesting question.

97
00:05:35.121 --> 00:05:39.260
I would love to see what is the Patriots that lifetime record against the Miami

98
00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.920
Dolphins?
Let's see here.

99
00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:46.720
Patriots first.
Dolphins,

100
00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:53.870
all time.
Uh,
wait,
what did I just say?

101
00:05:53.871 --> 00:05:57.080
I said it perfectly.
Lifetime record.

102
00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:01.860
See if we get it here.
This is why the Internet's fucking great.

103
00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:08.470
This is why it's fucking great.
Wait,

104
00:06:08.471 --> 00:06:09.131
what do you mean the pate?

105
00:06:09.131 --> 00:06:12.730
The Patriots one 11 one 11 and 10 in the eighties against the dolphins.

106
00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:17.720
It's not fucking possible.
Wait a minute.

107
00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:21.770
Okay.
And the 60s at dolphins won.

108
00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:23.930
They won four out of,

109
00:06:23.931 --> 00:06:28.931
so they were four and three and the 70s they were 13 and seven

110
00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:34.730
in the 80s the Patriots who are 11 and 10 I never would've known that.

111
00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:37.520
And the 90s they were 14 and seven

112
00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:41.760
Oh,
we didn't even do that.

113
00:06:41.761 --> 00:06:45.060
Well against him in two thousands we were 11 and nine verse them.

114
00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:47.100
I didn't even know that there was that close.

115
00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.540
I thought they destroyed us in the eighties and we won one more game than them

116
00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:56.130
and I thought we killed them in the two thousands we were 11 and nine and then

117
00:06:57.150 --> 00:07:02.120
this Dick Decade we were 12 and four.
All right,
so who's winning here?

118
00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:05.740
Oh,
Jesus.
12 and 11 it's 23 everybody.

119
00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:11.360
I can't fucking do this.
This is going to take forever.
You know what?

120
00:07:11.361 --> 00:07:14.570
I just realized.
I don't care if you can,
can you do give me a total?

121
00:07:14.571 --> 00:07:16.760
Do I have to fucking think?
I mean,
this is the Internet.

122
00:07:16.761 --> 00:07:19.970
The whole fucking reason to get on this is not the thing.
All right,

123
00:07:19.971 --> 00:07:21.350
let's see here.
Dolphins,

124
00:07:22.130 --> 00:07:27.130
one 1717 and 10 after two decades,

125
00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:31.250
then they were 27 and 21

126
00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:39.720
oh then they crushed us 27 and 21 than they were 35 and 28 my brain's going to

127
00:07:40.631 --> 00:07:41.171
explode here.

128
00:07:41.171 --> 00:07:46.171
35 and 28 then they were 44 in 39,

129
00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:56.330
Ben,
48 and 51 I believe I just did the math correctly.

130
00:07:56.450 --> 00:07:57.510
They're 48 and 51.
I'll

131
00:07:59.850 --> 00:08:02.660
swap a tape for the willow for fucking decades.

132
00:08:04.310 --> 00:08:06.560
So your that right there.
Whenever I gamble on football,

133
00:08:06.561 --> 00:08:10.100
I always stay away from division rivalries because it makes no fucking sense.

134
00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:14.600
But somehow it's like the jets as much as the jet suck,

135
00:08:15.650 --> 00:08:18.890
they still are the bills or whatever.
They you still going to go like you know,

136
00:08:19.250 --> 00:08:23.250
I don't know.
One of them's going to get you.
You're going to have a letdown.

137
00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:26.900
Gay play it twice a year.
It's really hard.
A big the two times he said,

138
00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:29.670
David said say pockets season.
All right,

139
00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:31.880
let's get down to what I really want to talk about.

140
00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:37.720
Dean del Rey's 52nd birthday party slash tribute to bond Scott at the Avalon

141
00:08:40.970 --> 00:08:44.180
might've been the most fun I've ever fucking had,

142
00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:50.540
um,
since I got into this business.
Um,

143
00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:55.130
it was a stand up show slash comedy show if you don't,

144
00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:59.850
if you didn't see the floor.
And um,

145
00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:06.240
the stand up show was Joey Diaz who should have been closing and then Mark Marin

146
00:09:06.271 --> 00:09:10.560
and then myself,
they should have flipped the fucking order.
But,
uh,

147
00:09:11.190 --> 00:09:11.791
we came out,

148
00:09:11.791 --> 00:09:16.791
we did done dean of course hosted the show was sold out and a,

149
00:09:17.581 --> 00:09:18.570
and then in the end,

150
00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:23.550
Dean went up in front of this all star band and sang the entire power age album.

151
00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:28.890
I got to see Mark Marin play lead guitar and I got to sit in on three songs on

152
00:09:28.891 --> 00:09:32.040
drums and a,
it's the best day ever played.

153
00:09:32.041 --> 00:09:35.340
And I still had a train rector and fucking live where.
But other than that,

154
00:09:35.341 --> 00:09:38.100
it was fucking great and a dude.
It was,

155
00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:42.600
I just want to thank everybody who played and let me be a part of that Dean del

156
00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:47.610
Ray for putting it together.
Scottie and Nikki Sixx,
Mike Devin,
Rudy Sasso,

157
00:09:48.750 --> 00:09:53.640
Josie.
Dave pushed her.
Steve Gorman fucking murdered it on drums.
Uh,

158
00:09:53.670 --> 00:09:58.500
Mark Marin,
George Lynch.
I know,
I probably forgot a couple of people.
Um,

159
00:09:58.560 --> 00:09:59.850
whoever the one got all,

160
00:09:59.851 --> 00:10:04.851
like they got like the same amps and guitars in exact gear that ACDC use back

161
00:10:06.931 --> 00:10:09.030
then.
So they had that crunch song sound.

162
00:10:09.031 --> 00:10:12.270
I know that we've been posting clips on Instagram and everything and,
uh,

163
00:10:13.050 --> 00:10:17.970
around the,
um,
around the internet,
but it was fucking unbelievable.

164
00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:21.810
Unbelievable night.
And I already knew that.
I love Steve Gorman as a drummer,

165
00:10:21.811 --> 00:10:26.811
but just watching him fucking murdering for an entire hour,

166
00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:32.100
uh,
it was incredible.
I still see,
I still cannot believe that that happened

167
00:10:33.870 --> 00:10:38.870
fucking play and drums and I'm looking up in this fucking fucking Nikki Sixx

168
00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:43.770
plain base,
Scotty and on guitar.
I don't think I'll ever get over that people.

169
00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:45.900
Um,
that was another thing,
you know,

170
00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:49.890
and that the part is thing about doing that is sitting there going,
how the fuck,

171
00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:53.970
what the fuck am I doing here?
Um,

172
00:10:55.410 --> 00:10:59.820
but Jesus Christ,
Dean del Ray,
I've never heard him sing better.
Um,
you know,

173
00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:01.950
cause now he got himself in like ridiculous shape.

174
00:11:01.951 --> 00:11:04.230
You know what's Hilarious is if you can somehow find clips.

175
00:11:04.231 --> 00:11:09.231
Two years ago when we did it and dean sang the entire highway to hell album and

176
00:11:09.901 --> 00:11:11.880
I believe the next day or two days later,

177
00:11:11.881 --> 00:11:15.930
he went to the doctor trying to figure out while he was still tired and his

178
00:11:15.931 --> 00:11:19.980
levels of something we're off.
And then that's when he,
uh,
he went on this diet,

179
00:11:20.970 --> 00:11:22.560
you know,
his new diet that,
you know,

180
00:11:22.650 --> 00:11:25.500
that fucking guy gets locked into something and he's just into it.

181
00:11:25.530 --> 00:11:27.840
You know what I mean?
You know,
I just quit drinking and then,
you know,

182
00:11:27.841 --> 00:11:31.920
eventually I come back to it.
That dude quits.
It's fucking over.
It's past him.

183
00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:35.910
And,
um,
but if you look at the difference,

184
00:11:36.390 --> 00:11:41.220
he doesn't even look like the same person.
Like two,

185
00:11:41.221 --> 00:11:45.270
two,
little over two years ago when we did the last one,
he looked like a fucking,

186
00:11:46.710 --> 00:11:50.610
he looked like he'd been on the police force with a desk job for like fucking 25

187
00:11:50.611 --> 00:11:54.430
years.
Um,
did undercover work.

188
00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.970
He got into a little too deep and then they fucking,
they pulled them out.

189
00:11:57.971 --> 00:12:00.310
You know,
can you get rid of whatever drug addiction he had?

190
00:12:00.311 --> 00:12:04.210
And he put it into fucking donuts and eating colorful cereal.

191
00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:07.090
That's what this fucking guy looked like.
And like you look at him now,

192
00:12:07.091 --> 00:12:09.640
he doesn't even look like the same person.
In fact,
he told me the other day,

193
00:12:09.970 --> 00:12:12.850
he ran into somebody and started talking to them and they will get acting all

194
00:12:12.851 --> 00:12:17.740
weird and he had to like reintroduce himself cause they just thought he was some

195
00:12:17.741 --> 00:12:18.730
sort of weird fan.

196
00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:26.290
So,
um,
he already killed it a few years ago,

197
00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:27.550
but uh,

198
00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:32.640
and he was horrifically out of shape and now this year he was in unbelievable

199
00:12:32.771 --> 00:12:37.600
shape and he fucking fucking murdered it.
And uh,

200
00:12:37.601 --> 00:12:41.920
and I would also give a shout out to this one dude in the crowd.

201
00:12:41.921 --> 00:12:44.470
The crowd was amazing with this one fucking dude.

202
00:12:44.471 --> 00:12:49.120
He took me back to the 80s when I used to see shows that the Worcester Centrum

203
00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:54.250
was the providence civic center.
This guy,

204
00:12:54.280 --> 00:12:58.330
he had the long hair not styled it all.
Okay.

205
00:12:58.360 --> 00:13:01.450
Not the way after a while they learned back in the day when you just grew your

206
00:13:01.451 --> 00:13:05.590
hair to piss off your parents,
you just didn't cut it.
You know,

207
00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:10.480
if you look at like fucking Robert Plant's hair in like before he got the do in

208
00:13:10.481 --> 00:13:13.510
the 80s.
Right.
Would you just let it go out?
This guy had,

209
00:13:13.511 --> 00:13:15.220
I guess it was more of a seventies haircut.

210
00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:18.280
You just parted down the middle and let it fucking go.

211
00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:21.670
He had the black fingerless gloves,

212
00:13:21.940 --> 00:13:25.300
the Jean jacket with the band patches on it and shit.

213
00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:30.360
And he was headbanging vintage headbang and like it was like 84 before Glam

214
00:13:32.860 --> 00:13:36.100
Cayman.
And he wasn't just headbanging with the beat.

215
00:13:36.101 --> 00:13:39.390
He was whatever the guitars were doing.
Uh,

216
00:13:39.460 --> 00:13:42.550
like my neck hurt watching him and uh,
I dunno if he noticed,

217
00:13:42.551 --> 00:13:46.000
but everybody that was on the show at some point notice him and was pointing

218
00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:51.340
like laughing going like this fucking guy.
I remember guys like this and uh,

219
00:13:51.370 --> 00:13:55.070
we actually,
I actually ran into him at the end of the show and,
uh,
uh,

220
00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:58.030
families took a little bit of video,
so hopefully,
uh,

221
00:13:59.290 --> 00:13:59.480
<v 0>yeah,</v>

222
00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:04.180
<v 1>it was just the coolest fucking crowd ever.
Like somebody walked by the line,</v>

223
00:14:04.220 --> 00:14:04.731
he's like,
dude,

224
00:14:04.731 --> 00:14:09.731
it looks like heavy metal parking lot meets the comedy store.

225
00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:13.670
It was perfect.
So,
um,
I mean,
I don't know.

226
00:14:13.671 --> 00:14:15.350
I haven't heard of Dean's going to do it again,

227
00:14:15.351 --> 00:14:17.180
but I got a feeling it was so much fun.

228
00:14:17.210 --> 00:14:21.620
There's no fucking way he's not going to do it again.
And um,

229
00:14:23.730 --> 00:14:25.600
you,
you,
you owe it to yourself.

230
00:14:26.940 --> 00:14:27.350
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

231
00:14:27.350 --> 00:14:29.210
<v 1>You got to come out here cause people going like,
dude,</v>

232
00:14:29.300 --> 00:14:30.590
you've got to take this show on the road.

233
00:14:30.591 --> 00:14:35.540
It's just too many fucking amazing people that have their own careers.

234
00:14:35.541 --> 00:14:36.410
All those musicians.

235
00:14:36.411 --> 00:14:38.900
I don't know how the fuck you would get that on the road somewhere.

236
00:14:38.901 --> 00:14:41.830
Maybe you could do a one off somewhere in New York City or something.

237
00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:44.450
I have no idea.
Um,

238
00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:48.500
but that's another great thing about living in La is all these guys are out here

239
00:14:48.501 --> 00:14:52.460
in la and everybody's always shitting on la going to fuck you.

240
00:14:52.461 --> 00:14:57.230
But did you folding fucking Bug Luba?
Yeah.
And then that happens.
That happens.

241
00:14:57.860 --> 00:15:02.600
Um,
and everyone was so generous and I remember afterwards,
like a,
I don't know,

242
00:15:02.601 --> 00:15:04.040
just everybody was just so fucking,

243
00:15:04.041 --> 00:15:08.030
everybody would like was literally a fan of ACDC and it was just the greatest

244
00:15:08.031 --> 00:15:11.790
night ever.
So thank you to Dean del Rey.
Uh,

245
00:15:11.810 --> 00:15:15.380
the all things comedy network.
Um,

246
00:15:15.410 --> 00:15:18.560
let there be talk podcast and,
uh,

247
00:15:19.310 --> 00:15:24.260
amazing comedian now who gets sustained rounds of applause.
Uh,

248
00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:27.680
um,
the last couple of dates I did with them,
I'm so happy for him.

249
00:15:27.710 --> 00:15:31.490
It was just a fucking night in my life.
I've his life too.
I should say.

250
00:15:31.550 --> 00:15:34.610
I'm fucking making it about myself.
Um,
anyways.

251
00:15:36.650 --> 00:15:37.200
Uh,

252
00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:39.150
<v 2>I dunno.
That's weird.
That was all positive.</v>

253
00:15:39.180 --> 00:15:41.160
Now that's kind of thrown me off my game here.

254
00:15:43.830 --> 00:15:45.660
I got a trash something now.
Oh.

255
00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:50.190
I actually am taking a connecting flight to Pittsburgh because the only direct

256
00:15:50.191 --> 00:15:55.191
flight is on southwest and I just cannot fucking handle the standup comedy that

257
00:15:56.761 --> 00:16:00.990
they tried to do on those things.
It just,
it's excruciating.

258
00:16:02.580 --> 00:16:04.290
<v 1>The jokes never work,</v>

259
00:16:05.290 --> 00:16:06.520
<v 2>at least when I'm on there.</v>

260
00:16:06.521 --> 00:16:10.180
And then there's just this awkward pause and everybody sort of laughs out of the

261
00:16:10.181 --> 00:16:14.410
awkwardness and it's just,
I find it unbelievably fucking unprofessional

262
00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:19.500
considering we're all on a fucking plane.
That always,
you know,

263
00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:22.500
they'd see always the outside chance this thing could crash

264
00:16:24.870 --> 00:16:28.320
is we're going down the tarmac and the guy's doing a Darth Vader voice,

265
00:16:28.630 --> 00:16:32.370
make sure your seatbelt is on doing this shit.
And everybody's

266
00:16:33.930 --> 00:16:35.880
fucking labs like,
dude,
what the fuck are you doing?

267
00:16:38.700 --> 00:16:40.310
<v 1>Sorry.
Um,</v>

268
00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:45.300
<v 2>I don't,
I don't know why it bothers me as much as it does because I actually,</v>

269
00:16:45.301 --> 00:16:48.720
I told you last time I went on the Internet and I tried to find people that

270
00:16:48.721 --> 00:16:51.450
agreed with me and I couldn't find one post.

271
00:16:51.451 --> 00:16:53.300
I went through four pages of the Internet

272
00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:54.660
<v 1>when I searched,</v>

273
00:16:55.460 --> 00:16:58.610
<v 2>you know,
flight attendant's doing their comedy routines and all it was,</v>

274
00:16:58.611 --> 00:17:02.600
was glowing reviews.
So at some point,
I guess I just have to admit that it's me.

275
00:17:04.150 --> 00:17:08.110
<v 1>That is me.
But uh,
you know,
they have an incredible safety record over there.</v>

276
00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:10.690
They really do.
But I don't think it's because of those fucking

277
00:17:12.610 --> 00:17:17.590
those fuck away.
I don't know.
I almost made a fucking joke that I,
I,

278
00:17:18.700 --> 00:17:22.930
I'm not gonna do that joke cause we live in a time that you just can't make

279
00:17:22.931 --> 00:17:26.080
jokes like that.
But just know that in involved Mohammed.
Atta,

280
00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:34.210
how about those Boston Bruins,
everybody,

281
00:17:35.140 --> 00:17:39.010
<v 2>they are tied.
We just got smoked by the Tampa Bay lightning,
four to nothing.
Uh,</v>

282
00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:42.190
we are tied for points.
We got three games left.
We're paying,

283
00:17:42.191 --> 00:17:46.840
playing the panthers,
the senators,
and then the pant is again,

284
00:17:48.130 --> 00:17:48.310
um,

285
00:17:48.310 --> 00:17:53.250
to see who's to have I guess Ho mice throughout the whole eastern culprits

286
00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:57.570
fucker playoffs.
Congratulations to them.
This amazing season,

287
00:17:57.690 --> 00:18:00.900
this amazing rebuilt,
you know,

288
00:18:00.901 --> 00:18:03.990
since we let all of those guys go from our 2011,

289
00:18:03.991 --> 00:18:06.450
essentially 2011 Stanley Cup team.

290
00:18:07.710 --> 00:18:12.230
The fact that they turned it around this quick quickly,
um,

291
00:18:13.470 --> 00:18:17.250
has been incredible in the only thing that sucks right now as a Canadian suck.

292
00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:21.960
You know,
cause I would be like really excited,
you know,
when we get this good.

293
00:18:22.010 --> 00:18:23.850
Do you want to go play a good Canadian team,

294
00:18:24.180 --> 00:18:29.180
a Montreal Canadiens team and have a great classic seven game series and um,

295
00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:34.290
you know,
it's like if the Yankees suck and the red sox are good or vice versa,

296
00:18:34.340 --> 00:18:39.300
it's not fun for the fence,
you know,
unless she just did Douche bag.

297
00:18:39.300 --> 00:18:44.010
And you'd like to see a one sided event,
but,
um,
playoffs are coming up.
Celtics,

298
00:18:44.470 --> 00:18:47.520
it's coming up.
I haven't been able to watch any fucking games.

299
00:18:47.521 --> 00:18:51.660
The amount of times I've had five or six games,
Bruins games or Celtics Games,

300
00:18:52.760 --> 00:18:57.690
just,
you know,
backlogged.
And I can only watch the first period of one game.

301
00:18:57.691 --> 00:19:02.070
Like I did the lightning game and then I gotta erase all of them because it

302
00:19:02.071 --> 00:19:06.690
takes up too much space.
I just don't have the fucking time.
You loosely,

303
00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:07.673
we Yada

304
00:19:09.270 --> 00:19:13.050
yawning like the fucking parent I am right now.
Proud to be a parent.

305
00:19:13.051 --> 00:19:17.130
But Jesus Christ,
you're fucking,
and I,
I,
you know,
I got all the packages.

306
00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:20.770
I think I'm going to have to get rid of them.
I don't even,
I can't eat.

307
00:19:20.790 --> 00:19:22.140
I don't have fucking time to watch them.

308
00:19:22.141 --> 00:19:25.230
This is all good reasons why you don't have time to watch them.
But,
uh,

309
00:19:26.910 --> 00:19:31.200
you know,
I,
the red sox came out.
I think we're like five and one.

310
00:19:31.260 --> 00:19:33.480
Everybody's excited about our pitching staff.

311
00:19:33.481 --> 00:19:38.481
The Red Sox who are now the evil empire and the Yankees have this little team

312
00:19:38.491 --> 00:19:42.090
that could,
that has,
you know,
500 zillion fucking dollars.
Uh,

313
00:19:42.091 --> 00:19:44.550
but the way the Yankees did it versus the way the red sox did it,

314
00:19:44.551 --> 00:19:46.740
we've literally become them.
But,
uh,

315
00:19:46.741 --> 00:19:49.290
it seems to be working for us and it's working for the Yankees.

316
00:19:49.291 --> 00:19:54.000
So I have a bet this year with Paul Versey,

317
00:19:54.570 --> 00:19:57.930
the pride of Trenton fee in Newark,
New Jersey.

318
00:19:58.110 --> 00:20:01.290
Paul Versey 50 bucks a game in the regular season.

319
00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:05.040
And I also have another 50 bucks a game with,
uh,

320
00:20:05.070 --> 00:20:09.780
with my agent who books me on the road.
So I figure if I,

321
00:20:09.781 --> 00:20:13.320
if I put some money on it,
I'll be able to,
you know,

322
00:20:14.010 --> 00:20:17.700
at least pay attention.
Cause I don't want to miss all this shit.
I don't know,

323
00:20:17.701 --> 00:20:22.380
become that dad that,
that doesn't know any,
any of the players' names.
You know,

324
00:20:22.990 --> 00:20:26.810
it starts talking about Omar Moreno and fucking Dave full,
uh,

325
00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:29.520
the Fuck Tim Foley de Felice from kids in the hall,

326
00:20:30.270 --> 00:20:34.890
Tim Foley and all these old guys.
Widleen Mcgee,

327
00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:37.860
you know,
it's like,
listen to that guy who doesn't know.

328
00:20:37.890 --> 00:20:42.840
You know when I was a kid,
talk is still talking about Stan Musial.
Um,
all right,

329
00:20:42.841 --> 00:20:45.180
let me read some of the fucking advertising here and then I gotta work.

330
00:20:45.181 --> 00:20:48.100
I gotta get the Fuck Outta here.
I gotta pack

331
00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:52.180
<v 1>my bags.
Go out to Burbank,
get on a fucking plane.</v>

332
00:20:53.290 --> 00:20:57.040
Um,
wait,
am I going here?
Who Do we got here?
We got here.
All right.

333
00:20:57.041 --> 00:21:00.160
Dollar Shave Club.
Everybody.
All right.

334
00:21:00.161 --> 00:21:02.800
Get rid of all the junk that's lying around your bathroom.

335
00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:06.340
It give it the cleaning it deserves.
Unless you live with a woman,

336
00:21:07.570 --> 00:21:08.770
then just continue to joy.

337
00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:12.940
You're one eighth of the fucking countertop in the bathroom.

338
00:21:13.180 --> 00:21:15.850
You probably don't really have any clutter.
Do you freshen it up with,

339
00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:17.410
do you ever try to like clean up your side,

340
00:21:17.530 --> 00:21:21.900
your little fucking third of the House to try to guilt your wife had to pick it

341
00:21:21.910 --> 00:21:25.960
up?
Some of our stretchy pants,
it doesn't really work,
does it?

342
00:21:27.130 --> 00:21:27.470
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

343
00:21:27.470 --> 00:21:30.650
<v 1>That was my goal.
I was just going to be,
I'm just going to fuck it.
I'm,
I'm gonna,</v>

344
00:21:30.710 --> 00:21:34.400
I'm gonna lead by example.
You can't lead by example.

345
00:21:34.550 --> 00:21:39.360
You gotta lead by example and you have to accompany it with,
um,
loud,

346
00:21:39.380 --> 00:21:40.213
sighing

347
00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:48.520
and then passive aggressive.
What's the matter?
Nothing.

348
00:21:49.130 --> 00:21:52.100
What do you mean nothing?
What's the matter?
Well,
you know,
it's just,
you know,

349
00:21:52.101 --> 00:21:53.570
you kinda got your

350
00:21:55.660 --> 00:21:59.680
stretchy pants all over the F.
Oh,
I'm sorry.

351
00:22:01.550 --> 00:22:06.290
I mean,
I,
I didn't do it on purpose.
Um,
fresh.

352
00:22:06.440 --> 00:22:10.700
Where does that go?
Where does it go?
It goes nowhere.
It goes nowhere.
Okay?

353
00:22:10.701 --> 00:22:12.860
That's why God invented the garage.

354
00:22:13.340 --> 00:22:16.580
That's the place we just go out there where you have the stuff that you really

355
00:22:16.581 --> 00:22:20.000
love,
that you kind of have locked out there so she won't throw it out.

356
00:22:20.650 --> 00:22:24.080
A fresh it up with high quality products from dollar Shave Club,

357

358
00:22:31.531 --> 00:22:35.940
door.

359

smell and feel your best.

360
00:22:41.010 --> 00:22:44.850
You get an amazing high quality shave every morning using dollar shave club's

361
00:22:44.851 --> 00:22:48.690
executive razor.
I can't stop yawning.

362
00:22:52.210 --> 00:22:52.991
Dear Dr Covey's,
you know,
it's going to happen.

363
00:22:52.991 --> 00:22:55.570
I'm going to get on that fucking plane and everybody's going to have the shades

364
00:22:55.571 --> 00:22:59.530
down except for that one fucking asshole who not only has the shade open,

365
00:22:59.531 --> 00:23:01.210
also has the overhead lighting on it.

366
00:23:03.290 --> 00:23:05.360
You get an amazing high quality,
uh,

367
00:23:05.420 --> 00:23:10.420
shave every morning using dollar shave club's executive razor there.

368
00:23:11.090 --> 00:23:16.090
Dr Covey's easy shave butter goes on clear so you can see where you're shaving.

369
00:23:18.020 --> 00:23:21.470
That makes no sense,
but it goes unclear.
How can you see where you're shaving?

370
00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:25.970
You need the fucking white foam to show that you already did that part of your

371
00:23:25.971 --> 00:23:30.920
face,
right?
You're saying that you can see through the shave butter,
I dunno.

372
00:23:31.460 --> 00:23:34.670
And since dollar shave club delivers everything to you,
you don't have to,

373
00:23:34.671 --> 00:23:37.220
you don't have to set a foot in a store wanting around the isles,

374
00:23:37.610 --> 00:23:40.850
hunting for razors,
shampoo,
body wash,
toothpaste,
none of it.

375
00:23:40.850 --> 00:23:43.070
You can just eat yourself into an early grave.

376
00:23:43.730 --> 00:23:47.030
Eventually your wife has to Shavia.
Clean up y'all.
Let's,

377
00:23:47.031 --> 00:23:48.290
how about a round of applause

378
00:23:50.030 --> 00:23:54.260
for all the people that stay with people that get that big,
you know what I mean?

379
00:23:54.860 --> 00:23:57.080
And they got to take them down to the fucking car wash,
you know,

380
00:23:57.081 --> 00:24:00.920
the self car wash and take out that fucking scrubber that the soaps shoots out

381
00:24:00.921 --> 00:24:02.870
of,
you know,

382
00:24:05.450 --> 00:24:10.310

Legal Zoom.

394
00:24:55.370 --> 00:24:58.040
It's a fact of life.
Attorneys are expensive.

395
00:24:58.280 --> 00:25:01.160
You're likely to pay around $300 an hour.

396
00:25:04.910 --> 00:25:05.743
Fuck.

397
00:25:06.830 --> 00:25:11.420
That's just one reason why smart business owners turn to legal zoom.
Sure.

398
00:25:11.540 --> 00:25:16.430
Over 2 million Americans have used legal zoom to start their businesses with LSC

399
00:25:16.431 --> 00:25:21.080
LLCs and corporations in more.
I got to take out the fucking Invisalign.

400
00:25:23.270 --> 00:25:28.090
Yeah,
we go.
But even right after your business is set up,
legal zoom can help you,

401
00:25:28.120 --> 00:25:31.330
can help you out.
Things like lease agreements,

402
00:25:31.390 --> 00:25:34.870
changing tax laws and contract reviews.

403
00:25:35.710 --> 00:25:39.310
Can you fucking do a postnuptial prenup with this?
I Dunno.

404
00:25:39.610 --> 00:25:41.800
Are all part of running your own business.

405
00:25:43.330 --> 00:25:47.920
Do you promise to love hold and Cherice and pick up your fucking stretchy pants

406
00:25:48.130 --> 00:25:52.180
when he sighs loudly I to,
well,
maybe,
I don't know,

407
00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:53.590
waving need to me,

408
00:25:53.920 --> 00:25:58.120
but these are precisely the kinds of legal hurdles that take time and effort

409
00:25:58.600 --> 00:26:00.490
away from growing your business.

410
00:26:00.520 --> 00:26:04.390
That's why legals and created their business legal plan with it.

411

412
00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:13.360

That's what vetted means.

you also receive access to Ndas,

415
00:26:22.511 --> 00:26:25.540
lease agreements and more.
The best part is you don't,

416
00:26:25.541 --> 00:26:29.800
you won't get charged by the hour.
Since legalzoom isn't a law firm.

417
00:26:29.980 --> 00:26:32.710
Instead you just pay one low upfront price.

418
00:26:35.630 --> 00:26:39.160

00:27:05.130 --> 00:27:08.700
one pair of jeans,
two shirts,
underwear and socks and that's it.

426
00:27:09.210 --> 00:27:10.860
He Slam it in a fucking bag.

427
00:27:11.730 --> 00:27:14.010
You never have to sit there at the fucking turnstile.

428
00:27:14.011 --> 00:27:15.090
I don't give a fuck if I was,

429
00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:18.720
if I was going on the road for the for a year that that's exactly what I would

430
00:27:18.721 --> 00:27:23.350
bring.
Never coming home again.
I don't give a fuck.

431
00:27:24.700 --> 00:27:27.730
And you wear black and white.
Johnny Cash wore black,

432
00:27:27.731 --> 00:27:30.520
so they couldn't tell he was wearing the same fucking shirt everyday.
Right.

433
00:27:32.860 --> 00:27:35.790
That's,
and that's how you gotta do what you got to wear dark colors.
You know,

434
00:27:35.791 --> 00:27:37.860
you start walking around dressing all flashy.

435
00:27:37.861 --> 00:27:41.400
All of a sudden you gotta be like Mariah Carey bringing all these Badass old

436
00:27:41.401 --> 00:27:42.690
shit out on the fucking road.

437
00:27:42.691 --> 00:27:46.650
I always think that that's why she's always in such a mood.
You know what I mean?

438
00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:51.450
Should we seems to be talking yet also thinking about something else at the same

439
00:27:51.451 --> 00:27:52.890
time,
I think she's probably wondering,

440
00:27:53.340 --> 00:27:58.340
did I pack those that dazzled red bottom shoes that have my face in diamonds on

441
00:28:01.141 --> 00:28:05.610
them?
Can we talk about divas for a minute?
You know,

442
00:28:06.480 --> 00:28:07.500
is there a reason,

443
00:28:07.980 --> 00:28:12.900
you know why they're vetting all these men out here in Hollywood yet they're

444
00:28:12.901 --> 00:28:15.480
leaving the divas alone.
I mean,

445
00:28:15.481 --> 00:28:19.590
just think about how many phones they've thrown at fucking people that are

446
00:28:19.591 --> 00:28:22.380
probably working for free.
You know,

447
00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:26.940
the amount of time they've slapped people in the face just said horrible things.

448
00:28:26.940 --> 00:28:31.710
At what point are we going to hold the Diana Ross is fucking high heel shoes to

449
00:28:31.711 --> 00:28:32.370
the fire.

450
00:28:32.370 --> 00:28:35.790
That's what I want to know that that's your homework between now and Monday

451
00:28:36.010 --> 00:28:40.860
chamber.
People say that.
That's your homework.
I took a yoga class the other day.

452
00:28:40.861 --> 00:28:45.720
It was fucking awesome.
I went there with my wife,
you know,
and uh,

453
00:28:45.780 --> 00:28:50.070
I actually,
I actually,
I found this,
um,

454
00:28:51.290 --> 00:28:54.240
this,
you know,
they are,
they have fake mess must statutes.

455
00:28:54.241 --> 00:28:58.320
They actually now have like fake man buns and I actually had a little fucking

456
00:28:59.100 --> 00:29:00.810
velcro strip strip that yeah.

457
00:29:00.820 --> 00:29:03.660
Glued to my head and I stuck it on the back of my head,
my bald head,

458
00:29:04.230 --> 00:29:05.340
and then went there and it was great.

459
00:29:06.780 --> 00:29:08.790
I've noticed say yoga teachers for some reason,

460
00:29:08.791 --> 00:29:11.400
they can't just take you through the fucking class.
They always have to,

461
00:29:11.401 --> 00:29:12.510
for whatever reason,

462
00:29:12.511 --> 00:29:17.250
they always have to tell your fucking story about how they failed during their

463
00:29:17.251 --> 00:29:21.300
life.
And then they remembered,
oh look who's here.

464
00:29:21.960 --> 00:29:24.600
Come busting through the door.
Hey Buddy,

465
00:29:25.600 --> 00:29:29.280
you've got your AC DC high voltage rock and roll.

466
00:29:29.281 --> 00:29:32.190
1975 one's a yawn.
Okay.

467
00:29:32.191 --> 00:29:34.830
I guess they got to put the mic down because somebody wants to hunt.

468
00:29:37.410 --> 00:29:41.740
You have any idea how much I'm gonna miss you over the next couple of days?
Huh?

469
00:29:42.610 --> 00:29:46.260
You know,
that's why I take the earliest flight back so I can see you sing.

470
00:29:46.390 --> 00:29:48.790
You the itsy bitsy spider.
Huh?

471
00:29:49.890 --> 00:29:53.050
About I can sing you some ACTC this morning.
Huh?

472
00:29:53.590 --> 00:29:56.950
Back in black hit thing.
I bet you know what?

473
00:29:56.960 --> 00:30:00.250
I had to be back without cutting loose.
Probably News,

474
00:30:01.430 --> 00:30:04.870
you know that was,
that was the song for Bon Scott back in black.

475
00:30:04.871 --> 00:30:09.640
Like they were at a funeral.
Um,
all right.

476
00:30:09.670 --> 00:30:13.090
I'm done with the podcast.
What are you guys having for breakfast?
Hi,

477
00:30:14.230 --> 00:30:18.460
you say hi?
Nothing.

478
00:30:21.160 --> 00:30:24.610
A Gol.
Hi.
All right.
I'll be in there in a minute.

479
00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:29.100
Thanks for helping me get to the last 90 seconds of the podcast.
Cutie Pie.
Um,

480
00:30:29.650 --> 00:30:31.950
oh yeah,
we got all,

481
00:30:31.951 --> 00:30:34.300
I got all this rock stuff that I always put her out whenever she,

482
00:30:34.360 --> 00:30:37.180
whenever I dress her,
you know,
they got these things.

483
00:30:37.181 --> 00:30:41.360
I got these Motley Crue onesies.
What is it called?
What does,

484
00:30:41.520 --> 00:30:46.420
what's Somali crew one set of shout at the Devil's shout at your Mama
there.

485
00:30:46.660 --> 00:30:51.550
They're fucking adorable.
What the hell is it called?
They're all like these,

486
00:30:51.551 --> 00:30:55.080
these cute like toddler punts and uh,

487
00:30:55.140 --> 00:30:58.720
the data level of close their kid kids can wear now even as toddlers,

488
00:30:58.721 --> 00:31:01.360
they attended,
they didn't have any of that shit when I was a kid.

489
00:31:01.361 --> 00:31:04.780
We had like Choo Choo trains,
you know,

490
00:31:04.781 --> 00:31:08.890
some sort of cowboys and Indians that just completely ignored the genocide that

491
00:31:08.891 --> 00:31:11.740
happened.
That's what the fuck we had.

492
00:31:12.300 --> 00:31:15.120
We didn't have all these cool rock onesies.
You know what Teddy said,

493
00:31:15.400 --> 00:31:19.360
kick this spoiled today.
Um,
well I need to save this.

494
00:31:20.710 --> 00:31:24.070
I signed up for global entry.
You know,

495
00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:28.870
the Illuminati one step closer to me building my fucking robot replacement when

496
00:31:28.871 --> 00:31:33.280
I answer all these fucking questions.
But,
um,
I just,
I just gotta have it now.

497
00:31:33.430 --> 00:31:35.320
Then I'm bringing my family and I'm fucking proud.

498
00:31:35.321 --> 00:31:38.920
That makes me feel this to say that I actually have a family have to just be in

499
00:31:38.921 --> 00:31:43.690
this isolated psycho stir fucking greatest.
It's the greatest thing ever.

500
00:31:43.691 --> 00:31:48.070
I love going to the mall.
I like going to the park,
pushing my kid on the swing.

501
00:31:48.490 --> 00:31:50.010
I remember looking at people thinking,

502
00:31:50.060 --> 00:31:53.110
I always knew having a kid was cool bass a thinking somebody at some level.

503
00:31:53.111 --> 00:31:57.880
I was sad for those people.
I had it totally fucking wrong.
So anyways,

504
00:31:57.881 --> 00:32:01.390
I'm going to uh,
um,
200 Gig in London,
England,

505
00:32:01.660 --> 00:32:04.960
Dublin and then over to London to in Royal Albert Hall,

506
00:32:04.961 --> 00:32:09.520
which was an absolute dream of mine.
And I'm going to record that night.

507
00:32:10.330 --> 00:32:11.830
Hopefully I'm going to do enough time.

508
00:32:11.831 --> 00:32:16.831
I'm going to make the double album then I'm only gonna put out on vinyl after I

509
00:32:16.841 --> 00:32:20.200
made fun of people that listen to records only on my last podcast.

510
00:32:20.201 --> 00:32:21.040
That's what I'm going to do.

511
00:32:21.160 --> 00:32:24.280
It's what I want to do at Madison Square Garden in that recording got fucked up.

512
00:32:24.670 --> 00:32:26.830
So I'm going to make sure I get it done right.
And,
uh,

513
00:32:27.070 --> 00:32:29.860
I also want to try to get a drum kit there so I can play during the day and hope

514
00:32:29.861 --> 00:32:34.420
they can find some fucking somebody to jam with over there.
Uh,

515
00:32:34.450 --> 00:32:37.420
but anyways,
afterwards I'm going to take a little week off,

516
00:32:39.530 --> 00:32:42.080
um,
over there in Europe and I'm bringing the whole family over.

517
00:32:42.080 --> 00:32:44.360
So when he got a little one flying that far,

518
00:32:44.361 --> 00:32:47.360
it's going to be a frigging nightmare.
Um,

519
00:32:48.260 --> 00:32:50.180
so at the very least,

520
00:32:50.181 --> 00:32:54.350
we can at least blow through the security by giving up a ridiculous amount of

521
00:32:54.351 --> 00:32:57.410
privacy by answering all these questions.
That's,
I,
I just had to do well,

522
00:32:57.411 --> 00:33:02.080
you know what's,
I had to make a sacrifice if so.
Um,

523
00:33:02.600 --> 00:33:04.820
that's it.
That's the podcast.
Once again,

524
00:33:06.050 --> 00:33:09.110
thank you to everybody involved with Dean del Rey's,

525
00:33:09.200 --> 00:33:13.610
a birthday celebration and all of that.
I mean,
that was just,

526
00:33:14.400 --> 00:33:17.750
I,
I,
you know,
I,
I took some video during sound check.
I got to put it up.

527
00:33:17.780 --> 00:33:21.530
You cannot fucking believe how good that band sounded.

528
00:33:23.910 --> 00:33:28.340
It.
They are top notch musicians playing out of all that gear from the late

529
00:33:28.340 --> 00:33:31.350
seventies.
It was,
fuck,
I was getting like goosebumps.
Uh,

530
00:33:31.360 --> 00:33:34.520
I know I took a couple of,
mmm.

531
00:33:35.830 --> 00:33:38.800
I walked out into where the crowd was going to be before they,
they,

532
00:33:38.830 --> 00:33:43.830
they brought everybody in and just listening to those how fucking good they are.

533
00:33:44.201 --> 00:33:45.520
And I gotta tell you too,
Steve Corner,

534
00:33:45.540 --> 00:33:49.690
just watching a professional fucking drummer is just my favorite goddamn up that

535
00:33:50.070 --> 00:33:53.950
closes my favorite thing.
It's just a sec.
How do they make it sound that good?

536
00:33:54.970 --> 00:33:59.240
He was incredible.
Um,
yeah.
So anyways,
I'll try to post some of that.

537
00:33:59.241 --> 00:34:01.240
And after I came down for the sound check,

538
00:34:01.340 --> 00:34:03.740
as I was so nervous that I was going to inevitably fuck up the songs,

539
00:34:03.741 --> 00:34:08.650
which of course I did in a number of areas,
um,
but I plowed through.
But,
uh,

540
00:34:08.651 --> 00:34:11.750
I wanted to make sure I had one more crack at it before the people came in.
But,

541
00:34:11.990 --> 00:34:15.440
uh,
after we were done with the sound check,
mmm.

542
00:34:16.540 --> 00:34:21.310
It was me,
Mike,
Devin,
I think Josh Z.
And we just,
we just started playing.

543
00:34:21.850 --> 00:34:24.640
I started playing some bond of beats and then they just jumped right in.

544
00:34:25.090 --> 00:34:29.410
And Devin started singing and I put the immigrant song up there.
And,
uh,

545
00:34:29.800 --> 00:34:33.490
it was just,
I was so much fucking fun.
Um,

546
00:34:33.640 --> 00:34:37.570
so I hope to continue to do that every other year or whatever the fuck he wants

547
00:34:37.571 --> 00:34:40.360
to do.
And anytime he wants to do it,
if they'll have me on,

548
00:34:40.390 --> 00:34:44.780
I would be honored to be there.
Cause uh,
that really was,
it's perfect.

549
00:34:45.220 --> 00:34:45.711
It's perfect.

550
00:34:45.711 --> 00:34:50.330
My dream of being a stand up comedian and then my dream hobby that I was never

551
00:34:50.331 --> 00:34:53.930
good enough to do professionally clean drums.
It's just fucking awesome.

552
00:34:53.931 --> 00:34:57.650
So a thousand thanks to him.
All right.
With that,
here's some,

553
00:34:57.710 --> 00:35:02.100
here's some music picked out by Andrew Feminists before we give you another half

554
00:35:02.100 --> 00:35:06.020
hour from a Thursday afternoon podcasts from earlier this year or a year gone
by.

555
00:35:06.021 --> 00:35:09.040
I don't know what,
but that's it.
Have a great weekend yet.
Comments.

556
00:35:09.050 --> 00:35:09.950
I'll talk to you on Monday.

557
00:35:24.430 --> 00:35:25.263
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

558
00:35:37.920 --> 00:35:38.753
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

559
00:35:48.160 --> 00:35:48.993
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

560
00:35:59.340 --> 00:36:02.130
<v 2>this youtube video of this week,
you really have to watch it.
Okay.</v>

561
00:36:02.131 --> 00:36:04.770
It's one of those showers.
It's basically,
it's a rip off of the view.

562
00:36:05.280 --> 00:36:08.430
It's for broad sitting around and they got,
you know,
the same thing.
You know,

563
00:36:08.660 --> 00:36:10.770
they've got the older one,
they got the sexy one,

564
00:36:10.880 --> 00:36:13.830
they got the one who was fat and then got her fucking stomach tied up like a

565
00:36:14.270 --> 00:36:18.300
goddamn balloon.
Not now she's dropping weight faster than a junkie.
Right.

566
00:36:18.540 --> 00:36:21.210
I don't even know if that's true.
I just looked around,
you know,

567
00:36:21.780 --> 00:36:26.520
they got the racially mixed chicks and they all got on their fucking shoes.

568
00:36:26.700 --> 00:36:31.170
Right.
The little outfits.
Hang on a second.

569
00:36:31.171 --> 00:36:33.330
Hang on a second.
Somebody's knocking.
I'll let you know what this is.

570
00:36:34.620 --> 00:36:35.240
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

571
00:36:35.240 --> 00:36:35.411
<v 2>All right.</v>

572
00:36:35.411 --> 00:36:39.760
You guys aren't going to believe this shit that was security and they just said

573
00:36:39.761 --> 00:36:44.130
that they,
they had a noise complaint
anyways.

574
00:36:44.131 --> 00:36:46.770
You know what some Richard Costs on the other side of the door at the fucking

575
00:36:47.040 --> 00:36:50.730
piece of one of those really fancy classes that they think came from France but

576
00:36:50.731 --> 00:36:55.530
actually came from a fucking pottery barn.
Um,
if you can hear me,

577
00:36:55.560 --> 00:37:00.330
go fuck yourself.
This is what you get for nuke in the economy.
Um,
anyway,

578
00:37:00.331 --> 00:37:02.280
so these four fucking brides are on TV,
right?

579
00:37:02.820 --> 00:37:07.050
And they ended up there talking about that guy that doing that story.

580
00:37:07.051 --> 00:37:09.900
You know that story where that dude got his dick cut off,

581
00:37:11.470 --> 00:37:12.303
<v 3>man out there.</v>

582
00:37:12.730 --> 00:37:17.730
Brace yourselves because we're about to go there because this woman,

583
00:37:21.070 --> 00:37:25.780
this woman allegedly did,
according to the Orange County DA's office,

584
00:37:27.010 --> 00:37:31.320
Katherine Q.
Becker is accused of cutting off her husband's penis with a knife,

585
00:37:31.890 --> 00:37:36.220
uh,
taking his penis and throwing it into the garbage disposal.

586
00:37:40.200 --> 00:37:40.380
[inaudible]

587
00:37:40.380 --> 00:37:45.340
<v 2>so talking about that guy who got his dick cut off
his wife,</v>

588
00:37:46.060 --> 00:37:49.870
drugged him,
tied him to a bed,
cut his dick off,

589
00:37:49.871 --> 00:37:52.240
threw it in a garbage disposal and turned it on.

590
00:37:52.930 --> 00:37:54.880
And it was basically because

591
00:37:56.590 --> 00:37:59.020
he wanted to get a divorce from her

592
00:37:59.830 --> 00:38:04.710
<v 3>police.
Say Becker attacked him because he filed for divorce.</v>

593
00:38:07.170 --> 00:38:09.840
<v 2>Did she mutilated them?
She ended the guy's fucking life.</v>

594
00:38:10.090 --> 00:38:11.760
And he saw of quality life is over.

595
00:38:12.710 --> 00:38:13.250
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

596
00:38:13.250 --> 00:38:18.250
<v 2>And these women are talking about it and lo and behold,</v>

597
00:38:18.920 --> 00:38:20.660
it's fucking hilarious to them.

598
00:38:24.860 --> 00:38:25.693
<v 3>[inaudible] California,</v>

599
00:38:25.880 --> 00:38:30.880
<v 2>they had all they could do to keep a straight face during the first minute of</v>

600
00:38:31.701 --> 00:38:32.870
setting up the story.

601
00:38:32.900 --> 00:38:36.790
And then all the jokes come and they're laughing their fucking asses off.

602
00:38:37.430 --> 00:38:39.570
<v 3>I do think it's quite fabulous.
I mean</v>

603
00:38:47.240 --> 00:38:51.000
[inaudible] cool.
I would've just thrown it in the dog's bowl.

604
00:38:53.720 --> 00:38:57.280
Does a dog have to suffer chewing on an old boat

605
00:38:59.660 --> 00:39:00.900
call?
Remember the Laredo?

606
00:39:00.990 --> 00:39:04.350
<v 2>It's the funniest fucking thing ever.
And this right here,</v>

607
00:39:05.130 --> 00:39:07.110
it's because of that type of shit.

608
00:39:07.890 --> 00:39:12.840
Then I don't feel that I am misogynistic.
I just don't.

609
00:39:13.140 --> 00:39:16.140
I think that I am just like women.

610
00:39:17.310 --> 00:39:19.380
I trashed women the way they trash guys.

611
00:39:19.410 --> 00:39:23.280
It's just nobody pays attention to the broads.
They don't.

612
00:39:24.910 --> 00:39:29.910
Do you think if a guide mutilated a woman in any shape or form that four guys on

613
00:39:30.761 --> 00:39:34.840
a pregame NFL show would be laughing about it and we'll hear more of that talk a

614
00:39:34.841 --> 00:39:38.710
little bit later as well.
Sharon Osborne was the guest and she goes,
okay,

615
00:39:40.050 --> 00:39:42.250
somebody asked,
do you think that guy deserved?
And she goes,
well,

616
00:39:42.300 --> 00:39:43.140
it depends on what he did.

617
00:39:43.420 --> 00:39:47.290
<v 3>Did I think I would have just depending on why she caught it all.</v>

618
00:39:47.650 --> 00:39:50.230
I mean it does depend on the reasons why does it

619
00:39:55.630 --> 00:40:00.150
[inaudible]
I'm still pro reason.
Oh,
I'll think of one.

620
00:40:01.310 --> 00:40:01.800
<v 2>You know,</v>

621
00:40:01.800 --> 00:40:06.800
I made that thought is totally overlaps the thought of those morons in the

622
00:40:10.200 --> 00:40:14.540
Middle East who cut women's clits off.
You know,

623
00:40:16.140 --> 00:40:19.650
it's fucking made evil thought and it's just considered silly.

624
00:40:19.680 --> 00:40:21.930
I don't know what it is.
I don't know.

625
00:40:22.200 --> 00:40:24.690
But it maintains what I've always fucking said,

626
00:40:24.691 --> 00:40:29.691
that women will do it to you exactly what they don't want you to do to them if

627
00:40:30.811 --> 00:40:31.644
you let them.

628
00:40:31.890 --> 00:40:36.690
And I think why so many guys are miserable in marriages is they get married to

629
00:40:36.691 --> 00:40:40.980
fucking young before they really know how to stick up for themselves in a

630
00:40:40.981 --> 00:40:44.130
relationship.
And that's why before you know it,

631
00:40:45.090 --> 00:40:50.090
you're married and all your shit is either in the basement of the garage and

632
00:40:50.101 --> 00:40:53.070
she's barely touching it and a,

633
00:40:53.071 --> 00:40:56.610
and you're wondering what the fuck happened to your life.
Yeah,

634
00:40:57.810 --> 00:41:00.510
I dunno.
The video is,

635
00:41:00.960 --> 00:41:03.630
is going to be up on the [inaudible] podcast.com you know something.

636
00:41:03.631 --> 00:41:05.490
This is actually,
I like this talking like this.

637
00:41:05.491 --> 00:41:10.491
This is very challenging to try and be funny with a late night DJ voice.

638
00:41:12.710 --> 00:41:16.110
All right,
this next chunk of the podcast goes out to the ladies.

639
00:41:16.500 --> 00:41:18.000
Ladies that you're out there and you're singing,

640
00:41:19.720 --> 00:41:22.420
<v 3>hang in,
there is a date rape or something.</v>

641
00:41:33.910 --> 00:41:34.743
[inaudible]

642
00:42:04.410 --> 00:42:06.070
<v 5>Hey,
what's going on?
It is,
uh,</v>

643
00:42:06.780 --> 00:42:10.760
Bill Burr and this is the Monday morning podcasts from Monday.
Uh,

644
00:42:10.770 --> 00:42:14.800
I'm going to go with April 4th.
I have no fucking idea what day it is because a,

645
00:42:14.890 --> 00:42:18.130
I'm doing something a unique this week where,
uh,

646
00:42:18.150 --> 00:42:21.000
people have asked me Saint Bill,
you know,
every week,
you know,

647
00:42:21.001 --> 00:42:24.810
you do your podcast.
It's just you babbling.
Sometimes it's funny,

648
00:42:24.811 --> 00:42:25.660
sometimes it isn't.

649
00:42:25.680 --> 00:42:27.810
Why don't you have a fucking guest on there every once in a while?

650
00:42:27.811 --> 00:42:30.190
How about a comedian that people,
uh,

651
00:42:30.210 --> 00:42:33.360
people want to know about or already know about wanting to hear his views on

652
00:42:33.361 --> 00:42:34.740
other shit?
So this week,

653
00:42:35.130 --> 00:42:39.450
this is a very special episode of the Monday morning podcast.

654
00:42:39.990 --> 00:42:43.550
While I will be doing it with a,
the one and only Mark Marin mark,

655
00:42:43.830 --> 00:42:45.270
what's going on?
Thank you for having me,
Bill.

656
00:42:45.271 --> 00:42:47.550
I didn't realize that I was actually one of the first guests.

657
00:42:47.670 --> 00:42:50.730
You've never had a guest.
I've had a Joe De Rosa who I do a,

658
00:42:50.731 --> 00:42:53.670
I do a show with on uh,
every,
once every,

659
00:42:53.671 --> 00:42:57.540
I think a leap year we do an episode of this show.
Uninformed.

660
00:42:57.541 --> 00:42:59.520
We used to do it on Xm.
What's a long fucking story?

661
00:42:59.521 --> 00:43:02.310
But so you have to have them on cause he lives in your apartment.
Yeah,

662
00:43:02.340 --> 00:43:06.170
he peaked there.
There you go.
Part of the contract.
It's in his week.

663
00:43:07.230 --> 00:43:10.710
It's basically,
yeah,
he lets me crash when I come back to New York to do a,

664
00:43:11.100 --> 00:43:14.400
to do Caroline's.
He sees the mixer.
I feel bad.
I'm like,
all right,

665
00:43:14.401 --> 00:43:17.160
grab a microphone.
Here we go.
But yeah,
you're the,
you're the first year,

666
00:43:17.161 --> 00:43:20.700
the first one outside of the,
uh,
the family.
You know what you are,

667
00:43:20.820 --> 00:43:23.370
you're Tim Roth and reservoir dogs.
You're the only one.
I'm not sure.

668
00:43:23.490 --> 00:43:27.020
So I ended up with a gut shot.
Yeah.
Laying there in the garage.

669
00:43:27.040 --> 00:43:27.960
The whole fucking movie.

670
00:43:27.961 --> 00:43:31.590
You're going to tell me you're a cop or something towards the end of this.
Oh,

671
00:43:31.591 --> 00:43:35.430
I'm not going to tell you that.
I wish I had that biggest secret.
No.

672
00:43:35.431 --> 00:43:37.790
But basically,
you know what the funny thing is is uh,
uh,
if,

673
00:43:37.850 --> 00:43:41.790
if the audio sounds different,
which means clearer this week is um,
um,

674
00:43:41.791 --> 00:43:43.590
actually this is how I have guests.

675
00:43:43.591 --> 00:43:46.800
This is the only way I do guess on the Monday morning podcast is if they already

676
00:43:46.801 --> 00:43:50.620
have microphones in a mixer.
And then I,
yeah,

677
00:43:50.820 --> 00:43:54.420
I invited mark onto my podcast and I'm like,
I got a rescue pit bull.

678
00:43:54.421 --> 00:43:57.300
I don't want to get sued.
So good half hour into it.

679
00:43:57.301 --> 00:44:00.510
So I'm literally setting in Mark's compound out here.
Yeah.

680
00:44:00.511 --> 00:44:02.630
And you brought your own equipment,
which I thought it was very polite,

681
00:44:02.710 --> 00:44:06.750
but I just automatically assume we just jump on my mix and I you don't think I'm

682
00:44:06.751 --> 00:44:08.460
a gentleman.
I brought my own mixer,

683
00:44:08.461 --> 00:44:11.310
I brought my own mix and then when we sit there and I'm sitting there with my

684
00:44:11.311 --> 00:44:15.300
little stupid fucking travel radio show and I'm like,

685
00:44:15.301 --> 00:44:17.670
I got a mixer and all that.
And then Mark's smiling.
Well you know,

686
00:44:17.671 --> 00:44:21.270
I kind of got that already set up.
You want to use mine?
I got the travel bag,

687
00:44:21.300 --> 00:44:23.760
I got the bag right there for when I have to,
uh,
you know,

688
00:44:24.070 --> 00:44:27.090
had talked to people on the road and hotel rooms and make me feel awkward.
Look,

689
00:44:27.091 --> 00:44:27.950
mark,
I'm not gonna lie to him.

690
00:44:28.010 --> 00:44:30.240
Our relationships on the rocks and I've officially moved in.

691
00:44:30.300 --> 00:44:31.990
You don't realize that.
Oh my God.
No,

692
00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:35.430
<v 6>I'm fucking with my shit in the car.
That's all right buddy.</v>

693
00:44:35.431 --> 00:44:37.830
If you could just sleep in here and if you know how to run a mixer,

694
00:44:37.831 --> 00:44:41.130
you could help me out.
There we go.
Can I be your assistant?
Yeah,
absolutely.

695
00:44:41.160 --> 00:44:43.020
A lot of people try to move up in this business.

696
00:44:43.021 --> 00:44:46.020
I'm going to try to go backwards.
Can I ask you a question?
Absolutely.
All right.

697
00:44:46.021 --> 00:44:46.591
So I'm in,

698
00:44:46.591 --> 00:44:50.090
I'm in Scotland for the Glasgow Festival for five days and I'm playing pub

699
00:44:50.091 --> 00:44:53.820
basements and I did my one man show it and not in a pub basement,
but in a pub,

700
00:44:54.220 --> 00:44:57.670
uh,
uh,
attic and I see posters at you.
Yeah,
they're,

701
00:44:57.900 --> 00:45:00.750
they're betting the big money on Bill Byrd.
I talking to the promoted there.

702
00:45:00.751 --> 00:45:03.450
I'm like,
is he a big drug out here?
And she's like,
I don't know.

703
00:45:03.451 --> 00:45:07.310
We're going to see out of go.
MMM.
I drew like 200 and then they,

704
00:45:07.311 --> 00:45:11.850
they papered another 400 drunk Scott's,
oh,
get him in there at the,
uh,

705
00:45:11.860 --> 00:45:16.530
the king's theater.
But it went great.
You know,
hopefully,
uh,
you know,

706
00:45:16.531 --> 00:45:19.440
I'll come back again.
I mean,
I,
how'd you feel?
I loved it over there.
I had,

707
00:45:19.470 --> 00:45:21.630
I actually,
I talked about on my podcast,

708
00:45:21.631 --> 00:45:26.160
I had a great time because I had a resentment of the Scots and of the UK in

709
00:45:26.161 --> 00:45:30.480
general,
only because the last time I went there I had a bad experience and I,

710
00:45:30.481 --> 00:45:34.560
and I chose to blame them other than myself.
What happened?
Well,
I was in the,

711
00:45:34.561 --> 00:45:37.560
I was in Edinburgh for 30 days doing that fringe festival and I,
you know,

712
00:45:37.561 --> 00:45:40.440
I was a,
are we three months since my wife left me,
I was miserable.

713
00:45:40.650 --> 00:45:45.360
I was broken and I was on a double bill with Kirk Fox that we were brought out

714
00:45:45.361 --> 00:45:46.350
there,
which is a,

715
00:45:46.590 --> 00:45:48.990
the best part of it because they paid for our lodging and everything else.

716
00:45:48.990 --> 00:45:52.110
Usually you have to pay for your own shit and I couldn't give it away.
I mean,

717
00:45:52.111 --> 00:45:55.080
we were drawing audiences of nine and you'll have to two weeks of that.

718
00:45:55.110 --> 00:45:57.900
You're like,
holy crap.
Do you want to kill yourself?
Yeah.
It's like,

719
00:45:57.901 --> 00:46:01.230
it's like open Mike every night.
It's like doing a show in Dedham.
Yeah.
It's like,

720
00:46:03.050 --> 00:46:06.030
it's like doing a show at a bar in Dedham.
Well,
you know what's funny,
dude?

721
00:46:06.031 --> 00:46:09.270
That's why I never did Edinburgh.
I always wanted to go over there,

722
00:46:09.271 --> 00:46:12.030
but it's a fucking month.
Same thing with Australia.

723
00:46:12.031 --> 00:46:14.730
There's some sort of Australia comedy festival and it's like,

724
00:46:14.970 --> 00:46:18.480
what can I go there for 10 days and like,
no,
you gotta be over here for 30 days.

725
00:46:18.481 --> 00:46:19.410
And it's like,
well,

726
00:46:19.760 --> 00:46:22.710
what will that the way they were supposed to do with my fucking life back here.

727
00:46:22.870 --> 00:46:24.240
Yeah.
You just,
you put it on hold,

728
00:46:24.241 --> 00:46:27.180
he gets somebody to watch your dog and you help your girlfriend doesn't run
away.

729
00:46:27.380 --> 00:46:28.350
That's that tiger woods.

730
00:46:28.351 --> 00:46:31.020
Shit I was talking about last week when I went off on his wife.
What,

731
00:46:31.180 --> 00:46:35.490
how can these fucking women who they get like a w w where they ha they,

732
00:46:35.500 --> 00:46:39.030
they married these rich fucking guys yet they don't have a job.
Right.

733
00:46:39.120 --> 00:46:42.390
And then they have kids and they still get help.
They get like a fucking nanny.

734
00:46:42.750 --> 00:46:45.380
There's somebody clipping the hedges.
They should,
they don't do that.

735
00:46:45.381 --> 00:46:48.650
Somebody clipping the kid everything.
Everything.
Yeah.
So I sat at,

736
00:46:48.651 --> 00:46:50.370
so as jokingly just fucking around,

737
00:46:50.371 --> 00:46:53.050
I was saying the reason why I messed around on her is because she's lazy.
Oh.

738
00:46:53.560 --> 00:46:56.550
And it's,
that's a very,
I don't know about you.
That's very untrue on attractive,

739
00:46:58.010 --> 00:47:02.100
uh,
quality old messy.
If you want Ac.
Yeah.
The same shit.
They don't like,

740
00:47:02.160 --> 00:47:05.190
who knows?
I mean,
if you want to talk about entitlement,
you know,
I just found,

741
00:47:05.191 --> 00:47:08.790
you know,
because I've had the processes over and over again in terms of,
uh,

742
00:47:09.150 --> 00:47:12.520
in terms of what the whole spousal support thing.
I mean,
my wife didn't that,

743
00:47:12.600 --> 00:47:14.640
you know,
she wrote a book,
she didn't have a job or whatever,

744
00:47:14.641 --> 00:47:17.340
and then afterwards done,
you think you're equals,
but then they're like,
you know,

745
00:47:17.341 --> 00:47:19.440
I want support.
I want this.
And they can exploit that.

746
00:47:19.620 --> 00:47:23.700
That's the saddest thing about fucking divorce is that it's set up so the woman

747
00:47:23.701 --> 00:47:25.530
can break you no matter what.

748
00:47:25.830 --> 00:47:28.920
And the reason I was putting the place might have been in earnest.
I mean,

749
00:47:28.921 --> 00:47:31.870
if you think about people when they first put sport,
spouses are born,

750
00:47:31.960 --> 00:47:34.600
I'm talking without kids,
not alimony,
spousal support.

751
00:47:34.810 --> 00:47:37.930
So grant that if you're married to a woman for 20 years and she's been doing

752
00:47:37.931 --> 00:47:40.810
nothing but making you feel better for your miserable life,

753
00:47:40.960 --> 00:47:43.750
and then all of a sudden it's done because he went and fuck somebody who did

754
00:47:43.751 --> 00:47:46.330
whatever and she's got to enter the world again with nothing.

755
00:47:46.330 --> 00:47:48.770
I understand what you,
she owes a,
you're older,

756
00:47:48.790 --> 00:47:50.620
a little payment to get yourself started,

757
00:47:50.740 --> 00:47:54.460
but if you're married fucking 10 minutes and the chicken is perfectly capable of

758
00:47:54.461 --> 00:47:56.620
doing whatever the fuck she needs to do to make a living.

759
00:47:56.710 --> 00:48:00.370
And then she still busted and takes half your shit.
Shit.
Where it's like,

760
00:48:00.371 --> 00:48:01.250
when it's a good one,

761
00:48:01.330 --> 00:48:04.720
when there's something good on the table that just as good as you and they're

762
00:48:04.721 --> 00:48:07.720
equals and they want their 50% but when it's something bad,

763
00:48:07.730 --> 00:48:10.870
I'm just the girl yet.
That's exactly.

764
00:48:10.871 --> 00:48:14.050
And they get it coming and going because guys want to fuck them.

765
00:48:15.050 --> 00:48:18.300
And that's why the judge,
the judge half the time when he's judging against you,

766
00:48:18.430 --> 00:48:20.770
was thinking he's going to fucking get some action with your ex wife.

767
00:48:21.270 --> 00:48:22.960
My judge towards,
he throws her a little look,

768
00:48:23.020 --> 00:48:26.110
we had little wink just sitting there like,
am I not fucking sitting here?

769
00:48:26.260 --> 00:48:28.870
Oh right.
So I'm married to this woman.
She's a comic.
She's an equal.

770
00:48:28.871 --> 00:48:32.150
We always use a condom.
I was like,
wow,
you're really gonna fucking Yo Yo.
No,
no,

771
00:48:32.151 --> 00:48:36.040
no.
I mean,
I,
I'm not gonna do that.
Look,
I will take my side,
I will own my,

772
00:48:36.130 --> 00:48:38.440
my shit there.
I had an anger problem,
you know,

773
00:48:38.441 --> 00:48:41.440
it took me a long time to learn that,
you know,
but I did learn it.

774
00:48:41.441 --> 00:48:42.251
If you're an angry guy,

775
00:48:42.251 --> 00:48:45.790
that means you're probably with somebody married to or living with or involved

776
00:48:45.791 --> 00:48:48.870
in a relationship with someone who's a pain sponge that will deserve,
you know,

777
00:48:48.910 --> 00:48:51.670
absorb your bile and bullshit until they can't take any more.

778
00:48:51.750 --> 00:48:54.100
And then they'll want to be wrung out by somebody else.
But you know,

779
00:48:54.101 --> 00:48:58.420
as an angry guy,
I knew that what I learned is that,
you know,
when you're angry,

780
00:48:58.570 --> 00:49:01.780
you compensate for it in other ways.
You know,
like I used to make her breakfast,

781
00:49:01.781 --> 00:49:03.190
you know,
espresso,
waffles,

782
00:49:03.191 --> 00:49:07.450
pancakes here knowing that me softly weeped in the corner of right.
That's right.

783
00:49:07.770 --> 00:49:12.100
This will make up for it.
But what I learned,
you know,
after,
uh,
after nine years,

784
00:49:12.101 --> 00:49:14.800
there's no number of pancakes are racist.
Shut the fuck up.

785
00:49:15.070 --> 00:49:18.190
Shut your fucking mouth.
[inaudible]

786
00:49:19.360 --> 00:49:21.940
before we get too deep.
But why don't we,
uh,

787
00:49:22.180 --> 00:49:24.290
why don't you back up here for a second Scotland.
No.

788
00:49:24.310 --> 00:49:26.830
Just cause I've known you so long.
You know,

789
00:49:26.831 --> 00:49:30.820
some of my listeners here crosspollinate here,
just so they know,
you know.
Uh,

790
00:49:30.850 --> 00:49:34.120
how long have you been doing stand up where you started out?
Uh,
let,
let's,

791
00:49:34.121 --> 00:49:37.750
let's get into stand up inside the actor's studio.

792
00:49:37.900 --> 00:49:41.630
I think that the first time,
uh,
you know,
I did stand up,
I was in a,

793
00:49:41.660 --> 00:49:43.720
I was in college,
I did an open mic.

794
00:49:43.721 --> 00:49:47.960
I was in a team with another guy I met in College Guy Steve Brill went on.

795
00:49:48.390 --> 00:49:52.090
They went on stage with,
with,
with another.
Originally we put the,
we put the,

796
00:49:52.091 --> 00:49:54.730
I put my first stand up together.
I always wanted to do it,

797
00:49:54.910 --> 00:49:58.150
but I met this guy in college who,
uh,
we auditioned for something,

798
00:49:58.151 --> 00:50:02.880
catch a rising star at that time it must've been [inaudible] 83 82 83 and that's

799
00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:04.780
what we want to in Cambridge and Boston.
No,
no,

800
00:50:04.781 --> 00:50:07.180
this was the original and that one didn't exist then.
It was the,
Oh,

801
00:50:07.181 --> 00:50:10.600
the original catch.
A rising star that was still up on the upper east side in a,

802
00:50:10.960 --> 00:50:14.920
in New York City.
The original cat green kitchen.
Right,
right.
Okay.
So,
uh,

803
00:50:14.921 --> 00:50:18.430
so they had posted all these signs around my college,
uh,
you know,
uh,

804
00:50:18.520 --> 00:50:21.310
catch a rising star live on campus.
They were putting together a show,

805
00:50:21.311 --> 00:50:24.730
like a showcase of college acts,
like new acts.
So,

806
00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:27.920
so we put together this team bit and we auditioned for them,
you know,

807
00:50:27.921 --> 00:50:31.820
in a room and they liked it.
And then we,
we,
uh,
audition for them.
Uh,
what was,

808
00:50:31.821 --> 00:50:34.810
what was the name of it?
Marin and something.
I don't remember if we had a name.

809
00:50:34.850 --> 00:50:38.480
I think it was just Marin and brill.
Uh,
and you know,
it was a series of sketches.

810
00:50:38.480 --> 00:50:41.000
It wasn't even real team.
It wasn't like team comedy.

811
00:50:41.001 --> 00:50:42.800
It wasn't like a straight guy and a goofy guy.

812
00:50:42.950 --> 00:50:46.640
We actually had several different sketches that we did.
I kind of remember them.

813
00:50:47.150 --> 00:50:51.740
They're,
the one sketch was,
uh,
you know,
where the word,
um,
n****r came from.

814
00:50:52.490 --> 00:50:55.400
Oh,
it's Jesus.
You came right out both barrels.
Well,
no,
it was like,

815
00:50:55.401 --> 00:51:00.340
and I hate to say that word even,
you know,
even in the context of,
uh,
of,
uh,

816
00:51:00.370 --> 00:51:04.100
you know,
casual conversation even though,
cause I get in trouble for that once,

817
00:51:04.490 --> 00:51:05.220
when,
what?

818
00:51:05.220 --> 00:51:08.000
I was trying to have a conversation about that word with a couple of black

819
00:51:08.001 --> 00:51:11.630
comics and I said the word as I just did now,
and a woman in my audience said,

820
00:51:11.750 --> 00:51:16.010
just the fact that you said it,
I'm,
I'm done with you.
See that's retarded.

821
00:51:16.400 --> 00:51:18.500
I know the word you're not supposed to fucking say.

822
00:51:18.830 --> 00:51:22.260
It's just how like you can't even like that.
That's one year.
Uh,

823
00:51:22.310 --> 00:51:25.190
people who do stuff like that,
it's like they're not even listening to you.

824
00:51:25.191 --> 00:51:27.640
They just have lists of words like these words are good.
Well,

825
00:51:27.650 --> 00:51:30.290
I used towards a bad that there's no like a right,

826
00:51:30.291 --> 00:51:33.560
but I can't integrate tech feeling that she had.
I mean,
you know,
if that word,

827
00:51:33.561 --> 00:51:37.520
no matter what context it is,
makes her co horrendously upset,

828
00:51:37.521 --> 00:51:39.890
then there's nothing I can do about that.
Whether it's right or wrong.
I,
you know,

829
00:51:39.891 --> 00:51:43.650
I can't account for feeling.
So we did that sketch,
which was these two,
uh,

830
00:51:44.180 --> 00:51:45.590
these two guys that were like,
you know,

831
00:51:45.591 --> 00:51:48.380
white guys who were working and they were trying to name the,
you know,

832
00:51:48.420 --> 00:51:51.890
the figure out a nickname for the people and it was like diggers and that it was

833
00:51:51.891 --> 00:51:55.100
stupid.
And then we did another one.
We did,
uh,

834
00:51:55.870 --> 00:51:58.400
Neil Armstrong's if Neil Armstrong on the moon,
the first moonwalk,

835
00:51:58.401 --> 00:51:59.240
if you were on acid.

836
00:51:59.450 --> 00:52:02.510
So my buddy played ground control and I play and I was doing the bit where I was

837
00:52:02.511 --> 00:52:05.790
on the most and crushed.
Yeah.
I would give well,
and then we did another one that,

838
00:52:06.540 --> 00:52:07.640
uh,
Japs funeral,

839
00:52:07.730 --> 00:52:10.850
like we did these two Jewish girls who were at a funeral of a friend,
you know,

840
00:52:10.851 --> 00:52:13.490
and they're like,
oh my God,
she looks so thin.
You know,
that kind of shit.

841
00:52:13.590 --> 00:52:17.600
There you go.
You kind of got everybody.
Yeah,
yeah.
We know blacks.
Jews.
Yeah.

842
00:52:19.070 --> 00:52:22.960
So what happens then is that,
uh,
we,
uh,
you know,
we,
we,
we,

843
00:52:22.961 --> 00:52:26.090
we auditioned him at the comedy connection.
We go to do it live.

844
00:52:26.190 --> 00:52:30.080
We had done it in a room and they said,
we want to see you live and we bond bond.

845
00:52:30.630 --> 00:52:34.440
It's just like sucking silence now.
What do you think?
Wait a minute.
Waves.

846
00:52:34.441 --> 00:52:37.040
So the first time you ever did it on comedy stage,

847
00:52:37.070 --> 00:52:40.520
now I've always said the first time if I bombed the first time,

848
00:52:40.760 --> 00:52:44.390
I don't know if I would ever have the courage to go back and do it again.

849
00:52:44.760 --> 00:52:47.960
Well then that's a difference between people that are,
are,
are,

850
00:52:48.080 --> 00:52:49.390
are hooked on it and people,
yeah.

851
00:52:49.400 --> 00:52:51.830
People who are born comics and people who are just,
you know,

852
00:52:51.831 --> 00:52:55.820
dabbling is that like really,
if you bond,
you would have done it again.

853
00:52:56.170 --> 00:52:59.750
It would've,
I would've taken me a minute.
I would had it been like,
just the,

854
00:52:59.840 --> 00:53:04.700
the sheer fucking embarrassment of,
uh,
of taking the hit.
Well,
I mean,

855
00:53:04.820 --> 00:53:07.910
you can see these a deal with stand up.
You can still eat it today.

856
00:53:07.911 --> 00:53:11.150
I'm 18 years in,
I,
yeah,
you can eat it,
but this is the thing.

857
00:53:11.360 --> 00:53:15.470
You have years of good shows to be like,
well,
you know,

858
00:53:15.500 --> 00:53:17.480
I know I don't suck at this.
I had a bad night,

859
00:53:17.481 --> 00:53:21.180
but you know right out of the gate.
Oh yeah.
The bad night thing is hard to,

860
00:53:21.210 --> 00:53:23.930
to really get around.
You had,
cause it still hurts me if I bombed,

861
00:53:23.931 --> 00:53:27.490
but when you're up there and know you have this whole idea that,
you know,
uh,

862
00:53:27.710 --> 00:53:31.320
it's,
it's never,
the audience is bullshit.
I mean sometimes it's the audience,

863
00:53:31.490 --> 00:53:33.930
right.
And you know,
like you could fall,
you know,

864
00:53:33.931 --> 00:53:37.020
you've done your shit and you can see where they're peaking laughter wise and

865
00:53:37.021 --> 00:53:38.740
you know,
after a certain point that,
you know,

866
00:53:38.760 --> 00:53:41.200
they're not going to go any further than that.
So I'll get after it.

867
00:53:41.940 --> 00:53:44.610
I'm just going to have to realize this is the best I'm going to do in this

868
00:53:44.611 --> 00:53:48.090
situation and either eat it and you know,
and take the hit or,

869
00:53:48.091 --> 00:53:50.340
or make light of the fact.
Yeah.
I've,

870
00:53:50.341 --> 00:53:53.330
I've learned like there's nothing worse than being angry on stage,
but I hurts.

871
00:53:53.350 --> 00:53:57.020
I actually heard a funny story last night.
I was doing a kick and uh,
this,
uh,

872
00:53:57.030 --> 00:54:00.840
this book or Jeff Wills from the,
I know Jeff.
Yeah.
He was telling a story.

873
00:54:00.970 --> 00:54:01.990
He's so one night,
uh,

874
00:54:02.220 --> 00:54:05.400
said Bill Hicks did an entire show with his back to the audience.

875
00:54:05.820 --> 00:54:08.800
It was like a Bachelorette party.
There was every fucking thing you do those,

876
00:54:08.980 --> 00:54:11.820
you know,
those Booker's they love to talk about those stories,
you know.

877
00:54:11.910 --> 00:54:13.650
But if anyone else did that now,

878
00:54:13.680 --> 00:54:16.860
they would never fucking work in that club again.
All these guys pretend like,

879
00:54:16.861 --> 00:54:17.221
you know,
like,

880
00:54:17.221 --> 00:54:21.360
Oh Bill Hicks was the guy and he went on stage and angrily tanked in a brilliant

881
00:54:21.361 --> 00:54:23.970
inspired way most all the time.

882
00:54:24.150 --> 00:54:27.240
But if someone existed like that now he wouldn't have a fucking shot.

883
00:54:27.300 --> 00:54:29.430
It think so.
Absolutely.
Well,
I bet.

884
00:54:29.431 --> 00:54:32.550
I bet he was still selling tickets at that point.
Cause you can't,
you can't,

885
00:54:32.580 --> 00:54:35.730
you can't turn your back on a fucking crowd and ever think that you're going to

886
00:54:35.731 --> 00:54:36.750
work.
I don't think that's true.

887
00:54:36.751 --> 00:54:40.420
I think that the reason he got booked in this country primarily was to,

888
00:54:40.450 --> 00:54:43.320
to make club owners feel like they were,
you know,

889
00:54:43.350 --> 00:54:46.380
they were at least championing something terrific.

890
00:54:46.740 --> 00:54:50.160
Like I think they innately knew this guy was special.
There was no one like him.

891
00:54:50.310 --> 00:54:53.520
And even the fact that he didn't sell tickets or alienated the audience every

892
00:54:53.521 --> 00:54:57.570
time they were going to have him twice a year to keep their content straight.
Oh.

893
00:54:57.571 --> 00:55:01.180
So that could be dicks to everybody else basically.
But just sort of like to,

894
00:55:01.270 --> 00:55:04.890
to at least support that we say knew well enough that he was an inspired guy.

895
00:55:05.010 --> 00:55:07.790
But I've gotten angry on stage.
I did it the other night,
dude,
not in it.

896
00:55:07.791 --> 00:55:11.010
And it would have been a long time because I used to snap all the tabs and say

897
00:55:11.011 --> 00:55:13.980
that's kind of an understatement coming from you.
Yeah.
But,

898
00:55:14.020 --> 00:55:16.950
but that's like me saying I've snapped.
No,
but I,
but you know,

899
00:55:16.951 --> 00:55:21.180
I'm pretty accessible now.
Not all.
Yeah.
Your,
your way,
your way.
Uh,

900
00:55:21.600 --> 00:55:24.510
but it happened at the store,
dude.
It happened at this how long ago?

901
00:55:24.660 --> 00:55:29.370
Two nights ago.
And I,
I go down this whole thing.
Yeah.

902
00:55:29.380 --> 00:55:31.380
Much better now.
Much better enough.
I snapped one time.

903
00:55:31.480 --> 00:55:33.890
What does that have a 48 hours ago?
I couldn't believe I did it.

904
00:55:33.970 --> 00:55:36.810
It's such a different person,
you know,
that place brings it out of you.
Come on.

905
00:55:36.811 --> 00:55:40.680
The comedy store brings it out of you sometimes.
I that's what I love it though.

906
00:55:40.790 --> 00:55:44.850
It's me too.
So fucking so I'm on stage.
It is evil.
It is.

907
00:55:44.851 --> 00:55:47.880
It's just painted on hate.
You know,

908
00:55:47.940 --> 00:55:51.690
you feel the walls wanting you to lose it,
you know it's just in the place.

909
00:55:52.470 --> 00:55:53.290
So I'm on stage,

910
00:55:53.290 --> 00:55:57.120
it's like 40 people in the room and like I'm already like just right when I get

911
00:55:57.121 --> 00:56:00.060
in there.
You have some kid,
that kid David Taylor,
you know that kid,

912
00:56:00.300 --> 00:56:03.840
he's a tall guy,
used to do comedy is very cynical and negative and I just,

913
00:56:03.870 --> 00:56:07.380
I wasn't in the mood for and hadn't seen him in months and I said hi to him and

914
00:56:07.381 --> 00:56:10.380
he goes,
I'm stayed around just to see you.
You better be good.

915
00:56:10.530 --> 00:56:13.230
And so right away I'm like,
I haven't seen you in a fucking long time.

916
00:56:13.231 --> 00:56:16.920
You have no right to fucking talk like that to me.
Enough with the negative shit.

917
00:56:18.340 --> 00:56:23.040
Storm dog getting angry again and marina anchor from and I walked back and made

918
00:56:23.050 --> 00:56:24.620
me feel really good about myself by though,

919
00:56:24.790 --> 00:56:27.670
cause usually I sound like the angry psycho.
I can be like the happy person.
Yes.

920
00:56:27.671 --> 00:56:31.000
We take take a break.
Yeah,
there you go.
Go ahead.
You Go.
All right.
So,

921
00:56:31.200 --> 00:56:35.360
so I get onstage magical one on who I think is just terrific.
I love how he's,

922
00:56:35.710 --> 00:56:38.350
I think he's fucking hilarious.
Totally original to unique stylists,

923
00:56:38.351 --> 00:56:42.040
real storyteller.
He does good,
you know,
and then he brings me up and then,

924
00:56:42.041 --> 00:56:43.500
you know,
I'm getting laughs.

925
00:56:43.600 --> 00:56:46.390
There's only like 30 or 40 people in the or and it's going fine.

926
00:56:46.391 --> 00:56:48.280
There's an old couple up front,
the,
you know,

927
00:56:48.281 --> 00:56:50.680
maybe in their mid fifties early sixties.
And they,

928
00:56:50.930 --> 00:56:53.650
if someone talked to him and [inaudible] and they asked him about religion,

929
00:56:53.651 --> 00:56:56.170
I think Neal Brennan did.
And they said they were Jews.
I'm like,
fine.

930
00:56:56.171 --> 00:56:57.850
So I'm doing my show and they're not laughing at nothing.

931
00:56:58.030 --> 00:57:02.500
And I looked at them and I said,
uh,
I'm sorry,
my two filthy.
You want me to talk?

932
00:57:02.501 --> 00:57:04.810
Some political stuff,
you know,
is,
is that what it is?

933
00:57:04.840 --> 00:57:09.480
And then the old man looks at me and goes,
you're not funny.
Yeah.
And I,

934
00:57:09.620 --> 00:57:12.790
and I just had this moment where I'm like,
all right,
dude,
all right.
And I said,

935
00:57:12.820 --> 00:57:14.830
you know what,
I am funny.
I know I'm funny.

936
00:57:14.831 --> 00:57:18.310
I'm doing well with the rest of the audience.
All right.
And,
and I,
and I,

937
00:57:18.340 --> 00:57:21.430
I understand what you're saying.
And,
uh,

938
00:57:21.431 --> 00:57:24.160
and then like for some reason I just looked at him,
I said,

939
00:57:24.161 --> 00:57:27.910
but the fact that that's what you had to pull out of your guts to say to me in

940
00:57:27.911 --> 00:57:30.250
this situation makes me fucking hate you.

941
00:57:32.850 --> 00:57:37.710
And,
and the Syrup punchline there,
mark,
now you lose the rest of the crowd,

942
00:57:37.920 --> 00:57:40.150
right?
There's this quiet the room.
And I'm like,
what?
That wasn't funny.

943
00:57:40.200 --> 00:57:43.270
What did I say?
Did Not come out funny now you turn on the rest of them.

944
00:57:43.390 --> 00:57:48.160
All right.
Then I turned on the rest of them
and then,
uh,
and then he goes,

945
00:57:48.161 --> 00:57:50.920
you know,
you asked and I said,
well,
you could've qualified.
Like,

946
00:57:50.921 --> 00:57:52.690
how about you're not funny to me.

947
00:57:52.780 --> 00:57:55.360
All of a sudden you're the god of this fucking room.
You're the Almighty.

948
00:57:55.450 --> 00:57:58.810
You're the one that has the last word.
Fuck that.
Right.
And so that,

949
00:57:59.080 --> 00:58:01.840
and then like I'll you in a bad mood before you got there because you really

950
00:58:02.080 --> 00:58:02.450
little,

951
00:58:02.450 --> 00:58:05.290
cause I gotta say the read of this guy saying y'all not funny sounds to me like

952
00:58:05.291 --> 00:58:08.680
you said some shit that he didn't want to hear.
It was more of a subject thing,

953
00:58:08.690 --> 00:58:12.100
not that it was a general thing.
So then I,
and the rest of the act,

954
00:58:12.101 --> 00:58:14.770
I'm doing my act and everyone's laughing every time.
Everyone else laughed.

955
00:58:14.800 --> 00:58:17.500
I looked at him and I went,
Huh,
Huh.
And then like you know,

956
00:58:17.501 --> 00:58:19.950
at the end of my set and bringing up her in as easy and he,

957
00:58:20.210 --> 00:58:23.620
he stands up with his wife and they walk out and while I'm still on stage

958
00:58:23.621 --> 00:58:27.730
bringing up Steve and I got very powerful statement,
very powerful.

959
00:58:28.030 --> 00:58:33.000
I'll see you later dad.
Ah,
Jesus mark.
Cause that's what I said to him.
I said,
hey,

960
00:58:33.130 --> 00:58:35.830
you know,
it's like every fucking Jewish guy that has that kind of judgment.

961
00:58:35.831 --> 00:58:38.500
That's your rage is just some surrogate for my father.
And I understand,

962
00:58:38.501 --> 00:58:41.320
I'm transparent.
I'm transposing some contempt on you,

963
00:58:41.321 --> 00:58:43.870
but you could have fucking chose a different way.
All right.
All right.
Anyways,

964
00:58:43.871 --> 00:58:47.650
Mark Marin here on a Monday morning park.
But that's not fun.
No,
no,
no.

965
00:58:47.651 --> 00:58:50.560
I'm just letting people know I'm acting.
You know what I just did there?

966
00:58:50.561 --> 00:58:53.700
I acted like this was a live show.
I like it.
Like take some color,

967
00:58:53.710 --> 00:58:58.630
like when it takes some time.
We're actually doing this on a Easter Sunday and I,

968
00:58:58.631 --> 00:59:01.180
a mark asked me what I want to do and I said,
I will do it Sunday.
And he goes,

969
00:59:01.181 --> 00:59:04.070
you do realize it's Easter.
And I was like,
yeah,
why I'm going to,

970
00:59:04.090 --> 00:59:05.260
I'm really not into that shit.

971
00:59:05.650 --> 00:59:07.900
But I actually went to church this morning with my,
uh,

972
00:59:07.901 --> 00:59:10.480
with my girlfriend and her and her mom because her mom goes,
so I,

973
00:59:10.481 --> 00:59:14.730
I went with her and a dude.
You should've heard the homily.
Yeah,

974
00:59:14.770 --> 00:59:16.000
that guy was up there.

975
00:59:16.010 --> 00:59:18.880
The homilies basically after they tell one of those you're Jewish,
right?
Yeah.

976
00:59:18.910 --> 00:59:22.510
Yeah.
So after they tell like the uh,
the little Jesus diddy,
yeah,
they have,

977
00:59:22.600 --> 00:59:23.500
they have like an opener.
Yeah.

978
00:59:23.770 --> 00:59:26.330
Tells a couple of little ones than the pre springs at home.
You know,

979
00:59:26.450 --> 00:59:31.250
all dressed up the headliner.
Catholic.
Catholic,
yeah.
Oh yeah.
Oh yeah.
Raping kids.

980
00:59:31.251 --> 00:59:34.570
The whole thing.
Deaf kids looking confused outside.
Yeah.

981
00:59:35.330 --> 00:59:39.870
How is anyone any adhere to that religion after this?
You can see,

982
00:59:39.890 --> 00:59:42.050
I even told,
I even was talking to some,
some older people,

983
00:59:42.051 --> 00:59:44.330
they were saying the same thing.
Like when the collection thing went around,

984
00:59:44.510 --> 00:59:47.180
I wanted to give money for the fucking car wash or whatever.

985
00:59:47.181 --> 00:59:48.530
But I'm thinking like,
yeah,

986
00:59:48.531 --> 00:59:51.770
but isn't this going to go towards the defense attorney for somebody who did all

987
00:59:51.771 --> 00:59:55.550
the fucking deaf kid?
I'm not giving you any more money.
Sort that out first.

988
00:59:55.551 --> 00:59:58.250
That's right.
And now it's like,
it's not an American thing.

989
00:59:58.250 --> 01:00:01.130
It's also in Europe and it's in the numbers and this has been going on for

990
01:00:01.131 --> 01:00:04.230
generations.
It's almost like it was a contest with these guys.
It's like,

991
01:00:04.400 --> 01:00:07.590
do one doesn't count if you do the same killed twice.
Yeah.

992
01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.760
Do you want to be a cardinal?
You've got a dental at least fucking three.

993
01:00:10.850 --> 01:00:15.370
I have a theory about it.
I think I know why,
uh,
that are so many gay,
uh,

994
01:00:15.420 --> 01:00:19.640
or pedophile priests because I think that these communities going back hundreds

995
01:00:19.640 --> 01:00:20.510
of years,
certainly in this country,

996
01:00:20.511 --> 01:00:25.310
and I imagine other countries that when a mother or a community saw that one of

997
01:00:25.311 --> 01:00:30.080
their male kids was going the way of the cock and then they started to pick up

998
01:00:30.081 --> 01:00:34.270
that they were feminine.
I mean the communities are the gay thing.
Just,
no,
no,
no,

999
01:00:34.271 --> 01:00:37.190
no,
no,
no.
Wait,
let me go this way.
All right.
I know what,
no,
no.

1000
01:00:37.340 --> 01:00:39.920
What I'm saying is that when they saw that happening,

1001
01:00:40.220 --> 01:00:43.080
they muscled these kids into the priesthood.
They said that as,

1002
01:00:43.081 --> 01:00:46.520
as opposed to live a life of sin as a homosexual,
probably go that way.

1003
01:00:46.610 --> 01:00:49.300
Let's push them towards the priesthood.
Now the,

1004
01:00:49.370 --> 01:00:52.280
and I'm not saying this will offset the Dick Sucking.
That's right.

1005
01:00:52.400 --> 01:00:55.250
And I think what happens a little bit safe and they couldn't do that in the

1006
01:00:55.251 --> 01:00:58.790
priesthood.
So I think a lot of them,
uh,
you know,
I'm not saying that they're,

1007
01:00:58.960 --> 01:01:00.800
they're homosexual and I know that they're pedophiles,

1008
01:01:00.950 --> 01:01:04.100
but I think that the guilt compounded with the idea that they may have been

1009
01:01:04.101 --> 01:01:08.180
homosexual and then that actually made them more evil because then they would

1010
01:01:08.420 --> 01:01:11.210
prey upon these kids that couldn't say anything that,
you know,

1011
01:01:11.211 --> 01:01:14.900
they could terrify and completely control with this horrendous urge.
I have.

1012
01:01:15.410 --> 01:01:19.430
I gotta be honest with you,
I have no idea because it fascinates me because like,

1013
01:01:20.850 --> 01:01:23.750
um,
I think cause a lot of people out there,
they confuse,
uh,

1014
01:01:24.560 --> 01:01:28.310
it being gay with being a pedophile because it is a guy and a boy.

1015
01:01:28.400 --> 01:01:32.180
You know what I mean?
So that's completely different yet cause it's like,
alright,

1016
01:01:32.660 --> 01:01:32.991
you know,

1017
01:01:32.991 --> 01:01:37.991
you could stick me and in that place and say that I can hook up with anybody and

1018
01:01:38.560 --> 01:01:42.410
uh,
I'm still not going to fuck a little girl.
You know what I mean?

1019
01:01:43.510 --> 01:01:46.010
Adam files.
But I think that that's absolutely true.

1020
01:01:46.011 --> 01:01:49.790
But I'm saying that I bet you a lot of them were probably on the,
on the,
on the,

1021
01:01:50.150 --> 01:01:54.320
on the train.
If they weren't abused by priests themselves.
Now on the train.

1022
01:01:54.350 --> 01:01:57.260
That's the thing about those guys is what they've 16,000.

1023
01:01:57.261 --> 01:02:00.500
It's like not only you ruined,
you ruin someone's life.
The second you do that,

1024
01:02:00.501 --> 01:02:03.830
that childhood is fucking over.
You ruined them.
You blow a hole in their soul,

1025
01:02:03.860 --> 01:02:06.950
it's over.
And then this is the thing.
And then they go on to have kids.

1026
01:02:07.220 --> 01:02:10.610
And even if they,
even if they don't do anything to them,
it's just,

1027
01:02:10.760 --> 01:02:12.560
it detach them.
You generations,

1028
01:02:13.010 --> 01:02:16.220
anytime you're talking 16,000 people like that old pro commercial,

1029
01:02:16.221 --> 01:02:18.710
they have five kids,
they have five kids.
They're all affected by that.

1030
01:02:18.740 --> 01:02:20.130
Oh absolutely.
And you know what?

1031
01:02:20.130 --> 01:02:23.710
<v 5>That they're troubled in laws.
So they're more candidates for the,
for,</v>

1032
01:02:23.780 --> 01:02:27.840
for the church.
Yeah.
They,
they,
they,
they become comedians.
That's right.

1033
01:02:27.930 --> 01:02:32.580
They're actually creating new lost to people in hopes that they will come back

1034
01:02:32.581 --> 01:02:36.570
to the Catholic church.
Yeah.
So I think this,
this priest,
because it was mandated,

1035
01:02:37.080 --> 01:02:40.200
all of that shit was kinda opened this week.
This priest,

1036
01:02:40.201 --> 01:02:41.970
I guess this guy is kind of like,
he's like the,
the,
the,

1037
01:02:41.971 --> 01:02:44.320
instead of the comic's comic,
this guy's like the priest priests,

1038
01:02:44.321 --> 01:02:49.250
like in the back of the room to the deacons in the back guys.
Great guys,
great.

1039
01:02:49.680 --> 01:02:51.720
No,
but he,
um,
he like,

1040
01:02:51.721 --> 01:02:54.510
he's actually admitted that he actually thought about leaving the priesthood for

1041
01:02:54.511 --> 01:02:59.100
awhile.
He's actually not,
he didn't say why,
but today during his homily,

1042
01:02:59.160 --> 01:03:03.060
when he's surmising the Jesus story,
he said something.
He goes,
you know,

1043
01:03:04.320 --> 01:03:06.120
um,
a lot of people look at this religion,
you know,

1044
01:03:06.121 --> 01:03:08.970
look at our religion like we do.
We say the,
uh,
the,
the,

1045
01:03:08.971 --> 01:03:12.090
the wafer is the body of Christ and the wine is his blood.

1046
01:03:12.091 --> 01:03:13.230
And they think that's nonsense.

1047
01:03:13.290 --> 01:03:16.890
A lot of people think that because we think that Jesus dwells in all of us,

1048
01:03:16.891 --> 01:03:18.330
that that's nonsense.
That he kept going,

1049
01:03:18.690 --> 01:03:22.440
just kept talking about major cornerstones of the religion and people thinking

1050
01:03:22.441 --> 01:03:24.270
was nonsense.
And I was sitting there going,
oh my God,

1051
01:03:24.271 --> 01:03:27.810
this is like the fucking Domino's pizza moment where they finally admit that

1052
01:03:27.930 --> 01:03:31.080
their pizza sucks.
Remember that?
Hold like,
dude,
fucked up.

1053
01:03:32.220 --> 01:03:36.930
We're not recording.
No,
we are recording,
but I thought,
I think,
see,

1054
01:03:36.931 --> 01:03:40.800
this is why we should have used [inaudible] out to me.
One.
Okay.
We're okay.

1055
01:03:40.801 --> 01:03:43.830
We're okay.
We're okay.
Yeah,
there was a little jump there.
I apologize.

1056
01:03:44.160 --> 01:03:46.440
I think we're okay.
I thought I had the metro really freaked on me.

1057
01:03:46.441 --> 01:03:47.161
We just actually,

1058
01:03:47.161 --> 01:03:50.640
literally for the first time and the two and a half years of the Monday morning

1059
01:03:51.150 --> 01:03:56.110
podcast,
it came.
It's stopped.
It never stops.
It's alive.

1060
01:03:56.510 --> 01:03:59.810
Goddamn show.
I just wanted to make sure that wasn't it.
Oh yeah.

1061
01:03:59.820 --> 01:04:03.670
He thought he thought the metronome was on.
That would be bad.
My bad.
My bad.
I,

1062
01:04:03.710 --> 01:04:06.600
so he was body of Christ and he's sitting there.

1063
01:04:06.601 --> 01:04:08.630
He's having like the Domino's pizza mom,
you know where they,

1064
01:04:08.631 --> 01:04:10.930
they admit that their pizza sucked after all these years.
Yeah.

1065
01:04:11.040 --> 01:04:13.860
And then they still try to put out a fucking large pizza for five bucks.

1066
01:04:14.010 --> 01:04:15.510
What do you think?
It's gonna Taste like idiots.

1067
01:04:16.050 --> 01:04:19.610
But he somehow spun it around where a,
it was,
it was the clothes.

1068
01:04:19.670 --> 01:04:22.730
You know what he's doing?
He's actually telling the truth,

1069
01:04:23.270 --> 01:04:26.930
the way he can tell the truth without having it be a national scandal.

1070
01:04:26.931 --> 01:04:30.380
Just going,
I can't explain the way he did the guy.
He's fucking good.

1071
01:04:30.381 --> 01:04:34.770
I got a medic,
I got to admit it.
David tell was a priest.
Yeah,
he got Ya.

1072
01:04:35.200 --> 01:04:38.160
I was like this guy,
this guy is good.
Look and I,

1073
01:04:38.161 --> 01:04:40.770
I got into it this way last week with like,
I used to do this,
this,

1074
01:04:40.771 --> 01:04:45.670
this section on,
on the podcast called old g h and I would talk about,
uh,

1075
01:04:45.710 --> 01:04:49.860
a religion and you know,
for the most part,
you know,
I was saying that they,
they,

1076
01:04:50.320 --> 01:04:51.270
ah,
I can't even get into it,

1077
01:04:51.271 --> 01:04:54.300
but every once in awhile people listen to the old podcasts where I was kind of

1078
01:04:54.301 --> 01:04:57.960
trashed and organized religion and they come at me and they drive me fucking

1079
01:04:57.961 --> 01:05:02.880
nuts because they just make grand statements.

1080
01:05:03.240 --> 01:05:05.220
Like you're,
like I said,
you know,
I went like,

1081
01:05:05.221 --> 01:05:07.830
I went to church for the first time,
15 years,
like a month,
like two months ago.

1082
01:05:07.831 --> 01:05:11.250
Right.
And when I went it was like,
I didn't like what they were saying,

1083
01:05:11.251 --> 01:05:13.710
but there was a feeling I had,
I liked the sense of community.

1084
01:05:13.830 --> 01:05:15.680
And then what they do is they go,
yeah,

1085
01:05:15.681 --> 01:05:18.510
that feeling you will feel and how much Jesus.
Yeah,
yeah.
They always got it.

1086
01:05:18.790 --> 01:05:20.410
They'd like,
they own that fucking feeling.

1087
01:05:20.560 --> 01:05:23.230
So then I'm sitting there going like talking about their fucking stories that

1088
01:05:23.231 --> 01:05:26.670
don't even make sense.
Adam and eve forget about how,
you know their,

1089
01:05:26.860 --> 01:05:29.740
their kids would then have to fuck and then we'd be all descendants of retarded

1090
01:05:29.741 --> 01:05:33.430
children.
Right.
They,
they,
they don't even address the dinosaurs.
I'm like,

1091
01:05:33.431 --> 01:05:36.430
what about the dinosaurs and all that?
Never addressed that.
They always just,

1092
01:05:36.580 --> 01:05:38.020
they never in the emails back and forth.

1093
01:05:38.050 --> 01:05:40.000
They will never address the fucking point.
You May,

1094
01:05:40.120 --> 01:05:42.400
they just spend it all off into other states.
Okay.

1095
01:05:42.550 --> 01:05:45.460
Jesus is waiting for you and all this type of shit.
And it just,

1096
01:05:45.461 --> 01:05:48.520
it drives me fucking nuts.
And then I,

1097
01:05:48.530 --> 01:05:52.100
I show them were science like this is what I can't stand the,

1098
01:05:52.160 --> 01:05:56.020
they'll attack scientists and say what they're saying is wrong until they can't

1099
01:05:56.021 --> 01:05:58.270
fucking deny it anymore.
Like the fact that the,

1100
01:05:58.271 --> 01:06:00.860
that the sun doesn't go around the earth and after,

1101
01:06:00.890 --> 01:06:02.680
if they've tortured and killed fucking people,

1102
01:06:03.070 --> 01:06:06.180
then what they do is then they embrace it and then they act like it's theirs and

1103
01:06:06.300 --> 01:06:09.840
they're like,
well,
who made the scientist?
Jesus made the scientist.
Sure.

1104
01:06:10.080 --> 01:06:10.770
And it's like,

1105
01:06:10.770 --> 01:06:14.130
<v 6>it's just a spin thing and they just hold onto their beliefs until becomes</v>

1106
01:06:14.131 --> 01:06:16.770
irrefutable and then they,
sorry.
It's sort of like those people like,
well,

1107
01:06:16.771 --> 01:06:19.820
how I am now,
what I always thought was fascinating is that these cults,

1108
01:06:20.070 --> 01:06:22.800
you remember years ago there was more of them where you'd have this called where

1109
01:06:22.801 --> 01:06:27.720
the leader would say,
the world is going to end on this date.
Tomorrow's the day.

1110
01:06:27.750 --> 01:06:31.680
Yeah.
And they get these,
these,
these followers frothing that and like ready,

1111
01:06:31.681 --> 01:06:34.410
prepared.
They're underground,
they're in bunkers,
they're going to go,

1112
01:06:34.560 --> 01:06:38.610
they're all strapped in and then the day comes and it passes and it doesn't

1113
01:06:38.611 --> 01:06:42.180
happen.
I would love to be at that sermon.
Yeah.
Because then it's sort of like,

1114
01:06:42.181 --> 01:06:44.610
well,
you know,
it doesn't mean it's not going to happen.

1115
01:06:44.611 --> 01:06:47.730
And now that we've got all this underground infrastructure,
yes,
that's right.

1116
01:06:47.870 --> 01:06:51.030
He's testing.
Let's start a mushroom farm.
Let's use this.
Yeah.

1117
01:06:51.060 --> 01:06:54.150
Now that we're in the basement,
I just don't understand how they read.
You read,

1118
01:06:54.420 --> 01:06:57.000
bought,
tell you why.
Because you've got,
people are so fucking stupid.

1119
01:06:57.030 --> 01:07:00.120
They're stupid.
That's true.
Yeah.
You got it.
But you're seeing that now,

1120
01:07:00.121 --> 01:07:02.220
even outside of religion,
even in politics,

1121
01:07:02.370 --> 01:07:05.730
that because there's so much information out there,
people,
here's what,

1122
01:07:05.731 --> 01:07:09.210
here's what really fascinates me is they will believe what they believe and you

1123
01:07:09.211 --> 01:07:11.880
can't shake their beliefs even with facts,
because now,

1124
01:07:11.881 --> 01:07:15.060
because there's so much information because the internet,
they can just go,
well,

1125
01:07:15.061 --> 01:07:18.380
that's your version.
That's,
that's the spin the truth.
Yeah.

1126
01:07:18.510 --> 01:07:22.320
The facts are the spin and that they,
you know,
that you can believe that,

1127
01:07:22.321 --> 01:07:24.510
but you're wrong.
No.
Do it.
That drives me.

1128
01:07:25.160 --> 01:07:29.050
<v 5>It drives me nuts in it.
And then they'll just like,
at one point,
uh,
I,</v>

1129
01:07:29.190 --> 01:07:32.860
I'll go like,
and like you guys have persecuted science.
Like basically my,
my,

1130
01:07:32.890 --> 01:07:37.280
my theory is that science is religion for intelligent people forward thinking

1131
01:07:37.281 --> 01:07:42.281
people and religion is science for morons because whatever they can explain,

1132
01:07:42.291 --> 01:07:44.980
they just invent fucking bushes talking to people.
Sure.

1133
01:07:45.080 --> 01:07:46.820
And albatrosses or whatever the fuck they have.

1134
01:07:46.910 --> 01:07:49.790
Conspiracy theories are the same way and this is what they ended up saying.

1135
01:07:49.970 --> 01:07:51.080
She ends up riding back.

1136
01:07:51.180 --> 01:07:54.920
Well actually science has proven the Bible correct over and over again.

1137
01:07:55.010 --> 01:07:59.240
So I'm like,
okay,
what's the,
where's the followup statement to support that?

1138
01:07:59.300 --> 01:08:02.630
Nothing.
Yeah,
there's nothing.
Yeah,
there's nothing,
there's no,

1139
01:08:02.690 --> 01:08:06.510
no followup statement whatsoever.
All they do is they just,
they,
they,
they,

1140
01:08:06.520 --> 01:08:07.130
they collect.

1141
01:08:07.130 --> 01:08:11.060
I can actually sit here and prove to you that the fucking earth goes around the

1142
01:08:11.061 --> 01:08:13.730
sun because of scientists.
I'm too fucking stupid approval,

1143
01:08:13.880 --> 01:08:18.500
but it actually on makes sense.
None of this shit can be proven on paper.

1144
01:08:18.950 --> 01:08:19.621
And,
and then when,

1145
01:08:19.621 --> 01:08:23.090
when you show stuff that can be proven on paper that disproves their shit,

1146
01:08:23.210 --> 01:08:26.300
then they do that show.
Well,
God created the scientist.

1147
01:08:26.301 --> 01:08:28.550
He created the paper that they wrote it like,
yeah,

1148
01:08:28.551 --> 01:08:32.000
they just sort of short circuit.
I actually find I tapped out in that moment.

1149
01:08:32.030 --> 01:08:34.040
I was like,
you know what?
I get it now.
You,
you,

1150
01:08:34.070 --> 01:08:37.880
no matter what I say are going to believe what you're going to say and I'm never

1151
01:08:37.881 --> 01:08:41.150
going to convince you that's right of the way that I think so fuck it.

1152
01:08:41.151 --> 01:08:41.984
So I'm done with it.

1153
01:08:42.150 --> 01:08:44.400
<v 6>Well we always,
the funny thing I'm dealing with it.
Yeah,
you can't,</v>

1154
01:08:44.401 --> 01:08:45.234
you can't go to it.

1155
01:08:45.530 --> 01:08:48.750
There's no reason to go to war with those people because belief is impenetrable

1156
01:08:48.870 --> 01:08:50.160
no matter how delusional they are.

1157
01:08:50.161 --> 01:08:53.940
It's based in complete ignorance and it's something,
it's something outside of,

1158
01:08:54.150 --> 01:08:54.870
of intelligent.

1159
01:08:54.870 --> 01:08:57.690
<v 5>Yeah.
But this is one I don't care cause I bought into it when I was a kid.</v>

1160
01:08:57.950 --> 01:08:59.400
We were scared and I,
I was,

1161
01:08:59.430 --> 01:09:02.500
I was listening to us scared and then also thinking like,
Oh I,

1162
01:09:02.620 --> 01:09:05.250
and some of this is good.
It was like my fucking house.
It was like my life.

1163
01:09:05.370 --> 01:09:06.660
Some of who was good,
some was bad,

1164
01:09:07.170 --> 01:09:10.230
but then it just got to a point where it's like,

1165
01:09:10.500 --> 01:09:15.270
this shit doesn't make sense and it's so loud in your head you can't ignore it.

1166
01:09:15.600 --> 01:09:17.100
And I don't understand I,

1167
01:09:17.220 --> 01:09:19.500
well that's because there's a real fucking arrogant statement.

1168
01:09:19.501 --> 01:09:20.580
I'm going to say only.
Yeah,

1169
01:09:20.581 --> 01:09:25.110
you gotta be a moron to just continue to,
uh,

1170
01:09:25.920 --> 01:09:27.570
to,
to,
to,
to block it out.

1171
01:09:28.350 --> 01:09:32.190
<v 6>That's the difference between free thinking and,
and thinking based in fear.</v>

1172
01:09:32.600 --> 01:09:35.600
You know,
cause like the way it works in my mind is,
well,

1173
01:09:35.720 --> 01:09:38.850
if the world is a scary place,
everything is,
is serendipitous.

1174
01:09:38.940 --> 01:09:40.830
Who the hell knows when you're going to get hit by a truck?

1175
01:09:40.860 --> 01:09:43.620
Who knows when the earth is going to fall into the sea or start shaking?

1176
01:09:43.800 --> 01:09:45.660
No one knows anything.
There's very little,

1177
01:09:45.720 --> 01:09:49.540
there's very few things we have control over in our life.
Just is,
I mean you,

1178
01:09:49.640 --> 01:09:52.620
you know how this,
this garage could slide down the hill at any second.

1179
01:09:52.621 --> 01:09:55.050
Who the hell knows very few things out of our,

1180
01:09:55.400 --> 01:09:58.200
are in our control almost nothing right now.

1181
01:09:58.201 --> 01:10:02.820
Depending on how frightening that is.
Even if you understand everything in,
in,
uh,

1182
01:10:03.540 --> 01:10:04.990
uh,
you know,
proportionately,
like,
you know,
the,

1183
01:10:04.991 --> 01:10:06.930
the possibility of this happening versus that having,

1184
01:10:06.931 --> 01:10:10.590
even if you're scientific about the,
the how,
how,
how,

1185
01:10:10.591 --> 01:10:13.230
how much fate has to do with our everyday life,

1186
01:10:13.410 --> 01:10:17.430
that is not completely comforting.
So depending on how overwhelmed you are,
right.

1187
01:10:17.460 --> 01:10:20.430
Oh,
that I taught I,
yeah.
So,
so I believe on some level,

1188
01:10:20.431 --> 01:10:25.030
the need to believe or feel like you're part of something bigger than you to,

1189
01:10:25.070 --> 01:10:29.400
to sort of justify your existence or make you feel comfortable in the world is

1190
01:10:29.401 --> 01:10:32.090
probably almost genetic.
I just feel that,

1191
01:10:32.380 --> 01:10:34.470
that the way communities function or whatever,
but you know,

1192
01:10:34.471 --> 01:10:37.530
you can make it your community,
you can make it a,
your television,

1193
01:10:37.531 --> 01:10:39.540
you can make it sports,
whatever the hell it is.

1194
01:10:39.541 --> 01:10:43.170
There's part of our brain that wants to be part of a bigger thing in order to

1195
01:10:43.171 --> 01:10:44.850
feel that were significant.
Thank you.

1196
01:10:44.851 --> 01:10:48.810
Just go in the ground and I'm comfortable with that because that's a whole

1197
01:10:48.811 --> 01:10:50.640
different thing.
I'm going to be right,

1198
01:10:50.641 --> 01:10:53.550
but I'm just talking about the need to believe now.
You know what,

1199
01:10:53.551 --> 01:10:56.270
you're gonna be able to grow unbelievable potatoes.

1200
01:10:56.270 --> 01:10:59.280
That's fine with my Irish DNA in the soil.

1201
01:10:59.460 --> 01:11:03.660
But I think that the people that whose wives are so fucking miserable that they

1202
01:11:03.661 --> 01:11:07.440
can't even fathom post us happy go lucky [inaudible] we got a lot to be grateful

1203
01:11:07.441 --> 01:11:12.020
for.
We do.
Doesn't mean we appreciate it.
That's true.
That's true.
But,
but,
but the,

1204
01:11:12.030 --> 01:11:15.540
I think there's some people that handle it and,
and the idea of heaven to them,

1205
01:11:15.541 --> 01:11:19.770
which is I agree with you,
is ridiculous and,
and frankly boring.
I mean,

1206
01:11:20.010 --> 01:11:21.600
the idea that we live forever,
I,
you know,

1207
01:11:21.630 --> 01:11:25.330
I can barely get through this one and the,
and the idea that,

1208
01:11:25.960 --> 01:11:29.040
and the idea that like it's going to be better because nothing boredom.

1209
01:11:29.190 --> 01:11:30.870
Oh my God,
that doesn't even make sense.

1210
01:11:30.871 --> 01:11:35.040
Like if it's absolute fucking euphoria forever,

1211
01:11:35.100 --> 01:11:38.700
it would get boring.
Oh my God,
they would get boring.
And that's like,

1212
01:11:38.760 --> 01:11:40.680
at some point you'd be like,
can I get a day pass to hell?

1213
01:11:40.680 --> 01:11:41.790
I want to fucking good time.

1214
01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.700
It'd be the hell would be like Vegas in heaven till one.
Are you going?

1215
01:11:44.701 --> 01:11:46.260
I'm going to hell for three weeks.

1216
01:11:46.800 --> 01:11:50.160
I got some time off from this tedious fucking happy bullshit.

1217
01:11:50.500 --> 01:11:52.440
I want to be able to feel happiness again.

1218
01:11:52.650 --> 01:11:56.340
Let me on fire for fucking three weeks so I can appreciate it.
Got It.
Go.

1219
01:11:56.460 --> 01:12:00.390
Have you been to the fifth ring?
Awesome.
Awesome.
Oh,
do it.
It's great.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1220
01:12:00.391 --> 01:12:04.740
We went there with a wife and I went,
it was tremendous.

1221
01:12:04.741 --> 01:12:07.080
They had great performance.
You'll all the comics went to hell.

1222
01:12:07.081 --> 01:12:10.260
So they're all there.
You got to go to the fifth ring.
It's tremendous.

1223
01:12:10.261 --> 01:12:14.190
Great shows.
Great.
Show me the heck.
Not even the hacks.
You can see Houdini there.

1224
01:12:14.280 --> 01:12:18.780
It's amazing,
dude.
Speaking of that Shit,
you know,
I did a,
like I did a theater,

1225
01:12:19.380 --> 01:12:20.520
uh,
what was it?

1226
01:12:20.520 --> 01:12:24.810
The San Jose Improv recently and he allegedly performed there and all these
guys.

1227
01:12:24.811 --> 01:12:27.320
It was fun.
It was a classic old theater that had,

1228
01:12:27.380 --> 01:12:30.720
had gone through that hundred year of history of like the most beautiful thing

1229
01:12:30.721 --> 01:12:33.420
ever.
And people flocked in an opulent place.

1230
01:12:33.660 --> 01:12:36.660
Slowly deteriorated to like a porn porno movie.

1231
01:12:36.780 --> 01:12:41.010
People jerking off and somebody like Jackie Onassis put some money together and

1232
01:12:41.011 --> 01:12:44.490
they fucking revive it.
Got a colorful history of corruption in filth.
Oh yeah.

1233
01:12:44.850 --> 01:12:48.810
Great.
Absolutely.
Absolutely.
So I show business should,
yeah.
So I went to,

1234
01:12:48.811 --> 01:12:52.360
I did the,
uh,
the Gibson amphitheatre last night for a,

1235
01:12:52.550 --> 01:12:56.580
that the Kevin and being show a radio show under this cancer.
I remember when,
uh,

1236
01:12:56.610 --> 01:13:00.750
being was in,
uh,
what was the name of the comedy team?
Steven Bean.

1237
01:13:02.130 --> 01:13:06.180
Chrissy Zito.
And being from Boston,
is that right?
Yeah.
Fuck,

1238
01:13:06.240 --> 01:13:10.160
you did not even know that.
Yeah.
Chris bean or Steve Zee,

1239
01:13:10.470 --> 01:13:13.800
I always heard of by her.
Yeah.
Those guys used to kill.
That's that.
That's them.

1240
01:13:13.890 --> 01:13:18.240
Okay.
To opt you up,
put you up at you,
but you up.
They used to open with a Jew,

1241
01:13:18.480 --> 01:13:21.170
Dah,
Dah,
Dah,
Dah,
Dah,
Dah,
Dah,
Dah.
He's a wop.
Yeah.

1242
01:13:23.970 --> 01:13:28.080
That was either being,
yeah,
that was the fucking eighties,
man.
That was before.
Uh,

1243
01:13:28.250 --> 01:13:29.400
when,
when,
when,
when did you start?

1244
01:13:30.030 --> 01:13:33.180
Well getting back to me after I did the team thing,

1245
01:13:33.210 --> 01:13:36.780
I was more thinking how chew up a dude [inaudible] would actually get a laugh.

1246
01:13:37.080 --> 01:13:38.670
Well No,
no,
I ignored the think that shit.

1247
01:13:38.690 --> 01:13:41.040
We were talking about the up the other night we were looking at a particular

1248
01:13:41.041 --> 01:13:41.821
comedian going,
you know what?

1249
01:13:41.821 --> 01:13:44.580
If this is a fucking eighties this guy would be famous by now because it just

1250
01:13:44.581 --> 01:13:47.010
seemed everybody back then completely subjective.

1251
01:13:47.040 --> 01:13:51.360
If you have like if you had any sort of a character,
the glasses you're wearing,

1252
01:13:51.361 --> 01:13:52.980
if you always wore those on stage,

1253
01:13:52.981 --> 01:13:56.380
if you did three then three evening at the Improv classes.
Yeah,

1254
01:13:56.440 --> 01:13:58.710
but you can't even get a pair of glasses.
It doesn't look like this.

1255
01:13:58.711 --> 01:14:01.800
Now believe me,
I don't want to surrender to the horn rims,
but you really,

1256
01:14:02.250 --> 01:14:05.190
you really have to struggle and fight to find something different.

1257
01:14:05.190 --> 01:14:08.340
Right now buddy Holly's there.
They're everywhere.
I mean some version of them.

1258
01:14:08.341 --> 01:14:11.070
I used to wear round glasses member and a and I,

1259
01:14:11.071 --> 01:14:14.560
I can find out anybody about you.
Yeah.
You've got that whole rock star look.

1260
01:14:14.561 --> 01:14:17.160
So when you wore the round ones,
you had the John Lennon looking now,

1261
01:14:17.310 --> 01:14:20.010
now you're looking a little buddy Holly and the crickets.
That's all right.
I,

1262
01:14:20.020 --> 01:14:24.100
I'd rather be a Peggy sue than,
uh,
than uh,
no,
that's not true.
They're,

1263
01:14:24.110 --> 01:14:26.950
they're both good.
I'm not going to take anything away from John Lennon,

1264
01:14:27.130 --> 01:14:30.040
but speaking of the eighties was just quicker cause I feel like I left it

1265
01:14:30.050 --> 01:14:32.470
hanging.
Is that after I did the team thing,
you know,

1266
01:14:32.471 --> 01:14:35.490
he graduated and went on to direct Adam Sandler movies.
I,
you know,

1267
01:14:35.491 --> 01:14:39.890
I wrote a whatever it Steve Brill did.
Um,
but I,

1268
01:14:39.891 --> 01:14:42.750
I stayed in Boston and I started on my own.
I started at play,

1269
01:14:43.090 --> 01:14:45.160
played against Sam's in the basement doing open mics.
What?

1270
01:14:45.161 --> 01:14:47.560
Kenny Rogers than everybody else.
In my last year of college,

1271
01:14:47.561 --> 01:14:50.980
I was doing open mikes that summer and I drank myself almost to death and was

1272
01:14:50.981 --> 01:14:54.960
waiting on my lungs.
Have those stories when you bring up Kenny?
Yeah.
Well I,

1273
01:14:54.961 --> 01:14:57.160
I mean not with him,
but I used to just wait.

1274
01:14:57.220 --> 01:14:59.740
You mean back then you had to wait to go on until everyone else was done for

1275
01:14:59.741 --> 01:15:02.980
three people.
I couldn't take it.
And then when I graduated college,

1276
01:15:02.981 --> 01:15:05.170
I moved to Hollywood.
I became a doorman at the comedy store.

1277
01:15:05.171 --> 01:15:08.290
I was there for a year and then I hit the wall and drugs and I went back to

1278
01:15:08.291 --> 01:15:11.080
Boston,
started over ketchup.
Wait a minute.
Slow down here.
Let's do this.

1279
01:15:11.081 --> 01:15:15.090
Do the behind the music here.
Mark Marin.
A lot of people know that story.
No,

1280
01:15:15.250 --> 01:15:17.680
you'd want to put it out there again.
Oh No,
I don't care.
But I mean,

1281
01:15:17.800 --> 01:15:21.250
the people who know me know why I came out to,
after I graduated college,

1282
01:15:21.251 --> 01:15:24.670
I already had a pretty good,
uh,
coke monkey on my back.
So I drove out here.

1283
01:15:24.850 --> 01:15:28.540
I moved in,
I was in Culver city.
We live in with Steve.
Just out of curiosity,

1284
01:15:28.570 --> 01:15:32.920
did you start before the ad campaign?
Uh,
cocaine,
the big lie.
Oh,
of course.

1285
01:15:32.921 --> 01:15:36.250
I started,
I started moving when the ad campaign was a coke.
It's good for you.

1286
01:15:36.280 --> 01:15:39.460
Yeah.
Yeah.
It was no more addictive than a caffeine.
Good Times.

1287
01:15:39.560 --> 01:15:40.393
We were all doing it.

1288
01:15:41.110 --> 01:15:44.260
So I come out here and I move into a place in Culver city with Steve Brill,

1289
01:15:44.261 --> 01:15:44.591
that guy,

1290
01:15:44.591 --> 01:15:47.050
we wrote a screenplay and that I never wanted to talk to them again cause we're

1291
01:15:47.230 --> 01:15:51.780
is unbearable.
And then,
uh,
I auditioned at the store,
uh,
to,
you know,
to,

1292
01:15:51.910 --> 01:15:54.270
to see if I could start doing comedy and Mitzi senior,

1293
01:15:54.280 --> 01:15:57.220
funny you can be a doorman.
So,
uh,

1294
01:15:57.340 --> 01:16:02.340
so I immediately moved into Crest Hill and I was a doorman in 1987.

1295
01:16:03.630 --> 01:16:08.320
Tennyson was,
uh,
it was just starting to come to break and I net you suck.

1296
01:16:08.720 --> 01:16:12.720
Why met Carl and Carl was Sam's best friend and he,
uh,
yeah,

1297
01:16:12.730 --> 01:16:15.340
he gave me a watch and said,
you're good people.
When Sam comes back,

1298
01:16:15.341 --> 01:16:19.420
I want you to meet him and you don't know the story.
I'll tell it to you.

1299
01:16:20.440 --> 01:16:24.280
So,
uh,
I can tell you stick.
Tell him no,
no,
I'm not,
I haven't done it that much.

1300
01:16:24.281 --> 01:16:27.100
And certainly people on your podcast might not know that people that don't

1301
01:16:27.101 --> 01:16:30.250
listen to both of ours,
but they know if they know Sam Kennison.
Oh,
of course.

1302
01:16:30.320 --> 01:16:32.620
My favorite.
Is this a cell phone fucking moment?
I want to,
I'll tell you,

1303
01:16:33.370 --> 01:16:36.790
it's a great story.
All right.
Uh,
so like I,
you know,

1304
01:16:36.791 --> 01:16:39.400
I didn't really know that much about Canada.
Soon when I got there,

1305
01:16:39.401 --> 01:16:42.640
I'd seen him once or twice,
but I had really dismissed him as this novelty act,

1306
01:16:42.641 --> 01:16:45.670
you know,
this screaming guy and I,
I,
I wasn't here nor there with them.

1307
01:16:46.120 --> 01:16:49.150
So when Carl said,
I'll meet,
introduce you to Sam,
I didn't know what that meant.

1308
01:16:49.630 --> 01:16:52.230
So Sam comes and you know,
in the car,
I was like,
this is,

1309
01:16:52.231 --> 01:16:54.970
that guy's talking to you.
He's talking about he's the new head doorman.

1310
01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:58.720
And Sam was like,
Guy,
the doorman.
So you're,
you're the new guy,
you know,
am I?

1311
01:16:59.030 --> 01:17:02.200
Yeah,
yeah.
And he's like,
yeah,
we should hang out and talk.
And I'm like,
all right,

1312
01:17:02.230 --> 01:17:05.920
so,
so I'm living in Crest Hill,
so he knows that place too,
right.

1313
01:17:06.160 --> 01:17:08.950
So the first night I ever hang out,
Sam Kennison,
he,
you know,

1314
01:17:08.960 --> 01:17:11.600
he comes up to Cresco,
which is that house Mitzi used to own.

1315
01:17:11.660 --> 01:17:14.420
And I'm staying there,
you know,
and guys used to live there.
A lot of people that,

1316
01:17:14.421 --> 01:17:17.840
yeah,
that's that classic house.
Just to tell my listeners,
know when comics,

1317
01:17:17.870 --> 01:17:19.370
like you would move out to La,

1318
01:17:19.700 --> 01:17:22.230
if Mitzi tapped you on the shoulder and knighted you,

1319
01:17:22.240 --> 01:17:25.370
you then moved into this house where you had to pay rent and also drive the

1320
01:17:25.371 --> 01:17:28.100
fucking jeep and take,
you know,
get her chickens.
Yeah,
totally,
totally.

1321
01:17:28.101 --> 01:17:31.220
But like the amount of Comedians who live there.
Oh yeah.
Dice with their,

1322
01:17:31.221 --> 01:17:32.600
the Todd was there to mio,

1323
01:17:32.601 --> 01:17:37.070
this was a tricky thing to mio Tookie who used to date,
Sam was a Japanese comic.

1324
01:17:37.071 --> 01:17:39.340
I don't know what happened to her,
but she lived upstairs.
You know,

1325
01:17:39.410 --> 01:17:42.890
I lived in dices old room.
Uh,
Todd wasn't moved in yet.

1326
01:17:42.891 --> 01:17:46.940
I'm trying to think of who Todd limits.
He,
he later went on to have,

1327
01:17:47.130 --> 01:17:50.330
he used to call himself that Todd and eventually had some sort of aneurysm and,

1328
01:17:50.660 --> 01:17:52.490
and you know,
showed up at the club saying,
you know,

1329
01:17:52.491 --> 01:17:55.610
years after Sam died saying Tim's come in and you know,
he was sent to Florida.

1330
01:17:55.610 --> 01:17:59.720
But I,
but if that's a Shubert lived there for awhile places evil.
Yeah.
Oh,

1331
01:17:59.721 --> 01:18:03.710
definitely.
Definitely.
So,
so what happens is I'm living up there and,
and uh,

1332
01:18:03.730 --> 01:18:05.750
and Sam says,
you know,
let's go up to the house,
you know,

1333
01:18:05.751 --> 01:18:08.880
and this is the way it worked back then.
It's Monday night,
uh,

1334
01:18:08.960 --> 01:18:13.070
in the late eighties was no cover night and all the rooms were free.

1335
01:18:13.280 --> 01:18:17.120
So all the freaks from Hollywood and everywhere came to the store on Monday

1336
01:18:17.120 --> 01:18:19.340
night.
And that was Sam's night.
He would show up at about 1130,

1337
01:18:19.341 --> 01:18:22.460
12 o'clock on a Monday,
take over the stage in the main room,

1338
01:18:22.550 --> 01:18:25.750
which was just filled with rock and roll drug freaks and just say,

1339
01:18:26.100 --> 01:18:27.860
this is like hair,
metal,
hair,
metal.

1340
01:18:28.010 --> 01:18:29.600
There's all different kinds of hair metal though,

1341
01:18:29.601 --> 01:18:32.030
end of towards the end of hair metal.
Yeah.
So like,
you know,

1342
01:18:32.031 --> 01:18:35.150
the people that would come to the club where it was pretty spectacular,
you know,

1343
01:18:35.151 --> 01:18:37.040
and I was a doorman and at that time that people,

1344
01:18:37.300 --> 01:18:41.320
ut on stage where people like dice,
Damon Wayans Kennison,
uh,

1345
01:18:41.480 --> 01:18:46.310
prior was still coming by occasionally.
Christ.
Um,
you know,

1346
01:18:47.270 --> 01:18:51.660
so I was just,
I just entered this world,
right?
So Sam says,
let's hang out.

1347
01:18:51.770 --> 01:18:53.990
So we go up to the house,
it's just me and Sam were doing coke.

1348
01:18:54.650 --> 01:18:57.500
He pulls out all this coke and we're just sitting there and he's like,

1349
01:18:57.590 --> 01:19:01.100
so you're the new guy,
you know,
June this year.
And he's looking right in my face.

1350
01:19:01.101 --> 01:19:02.570
He's like,
look,
me in the eyes mayor,

1351
01:19:02.571 --> 01:19:05.180
and a lack of men who can look me in the eyes.
And I'm like,
Holy Shit.
All right,

1352
01:19:05.181 --> 01:19:06.320
I'm looking right.

1353
01:19:06.321 --> 01:19:09.770
So we're sitting there doing coke and I thought I was Mr Rock and roll.

1354
01:19:09.771 --> 01:19:13.670
I can handle coke's.
I'm doing coke with Sam and he's laying out the world,

1355
01:19:13.671 --> 01:19:15.560
you know,
as Sam,
you know,
Deq and the thing,

1356
01:19:15.561 --> 01:19:19.430
I cannot tell you how it works here from Aaron,
you know,
and then like,
you know,

1357
01:19:19.540 --> 01:19:22.970
out of nowhere he goes,
Hey Marin,
you ever,
he ever burned money?
And I'm like,
no.

1358
01:19:22.971 --> 01:19:24.470
And he's like,
let's burn some money.

1359
01:19:24.830 --> 01:19:28.160
So Sam pulls out these hundred dollar bills and we start burning money at Sam's.

1360
01:19:28.161 --> 01:19:30.740
I'm figuring fuckhead.
Yeah.
Okay.
What's burned some money.

1361
01:19:31.390 --> 01:19:33.380
We're sitting there burning money and we're getting fucked up.

1362
01:19:33.790 --> 01:19:38.150
It is about three 34 in the morning and we're at a coke and Sam's wasted and I'm

1363
01:19:38.151 --> 01:19:41.660
kind of wasting.
So like when you buy a yacht and money too?
No,
he,
yeah,

1364
01:19:41.960 --> 01:19:44.650
he shouldn't have done that to me cause I called that back later and he wasn't

1365
01:19:44.690 --> 01:19:47.600
that happy about it.
I mean,
I made them do like the way this,

1366
01:19:47.660 --> 01:19:49.850
I'll tell you what happens.
This is the first night.
So he's like,
we're at a coke,

1367
01:19:49.860 --> 01:19:51.800
let's go get some more coke.
And I'm like,
all right,
I don't,

1368
01:19:52.130 --> 01:19:53.930
I don't know where we're going until we get in my car.

1369
01:19:54.050 --> 01:19:56.750
I'm driving like pretty much one of the biggest stars in comedy through the

1370
01:19:56.751 --> 01:19:59.930
Hollywood hills at like three 30 in the fucking morning.

1371
01:19:59.990 --> 01:20:03.470
He's half passed out in my car.
Like,
can,
I'm trying to like,
where are we going?

1372
01:20:03.471 --> 01:20:06.980
Where are we going?
He like,
he like wakes up and he goes,
I don't even know you.

1373
01:20:06.990 --> 01:20:09.570
You could kill me.
And I'm like,
well,
where are we going dude?

1374
01:20:09.810 --> 01:20:13.710
So we ended up at this guy's house at this point is he stopped being Sam Kinison

1375
01:20:13.920 --> 01:20:17.250
and it's become some annoying guy that you're partying with?
No,
he is still,

1376
01:20:17.251 --> 01:20:21.460
he was really good at staying in still Sam.
Okay.
Even when he was like swapping,

1377
01:20:21.660 --> 01:20:23.280
you know when it got pathetic,

1378
01:20:23.560 --> 01:20:26.460
he still held onto that thing and it was always sort of men.

1379
01:20:26.640 --> 01:20:30.140
It's ever burned money.
Dude.
I started too fucking late in this business.
So,

1380
01:20:30.141 --> 01:20:32.910
so we fun was gone through.
We'd get to this guy's house,

1381
01:20:33.240 --> 01:20:37.980
this guy who as as time went on,
I real,
I grew to know was a hairdresser by day,

1382
01:20:38.010 --> 01:20:40.860
but with Sam's coke dealer at the time and it's out on,
it's,

1383
01:20:40.970 --> 01:20:43.140
that was down on crescent heights.
It wasn't that far from the store.

1384
01:20:43.141 --> 01:20:46.530
So we knock on this door,
this guy shows up at the door in his bathrobe,

1385
01:20:46.560 --> 01:20:48.630
clearly woke them up from sweeping.
I got salaries,

1386
01:20:48.780 --> 01:20:53.370
we need to go and we barrel into this guy's house and we're in this guy's

1387
01:20:53.371 --> 01:20:56.880
bedroom and Sam just sits on the floor,
crashes on the floor,
he goes,
got any,

1388
01:20:56.910 --> 01:20:59.700
you got any booze?
And,
and this guy was like,

1389
01:20:59.701 --> 01:21:01.470
I just got these miniatures I got on the plane.

1390
01:21:02.130 --> 01:21:05.040
So now Sam is sitting there with these like severe enough bottles of vodka

1391
01:21:06.170 --> 01:21:07.650
drinking the Smirnoff.
You look like a giant,

1392
01:21:07.651 --> 01:21:10.880
like he should have been surrounded by the rock and roll people going

1393
01:21:12.540 --> 01:21:17.070
and then like,
you know,
he passes out in this guy's floor and you know,

1394
01:21:17.071 --> 01:21:18.830
the guy gives me the coke,
you know,

1395
01:21:18.990 --> 01:21:21.090
I end up paying for it and then I go out there,

1396
01:21:21.100 --> 01:21:24.910
an Asian guy throwing fire fireworks and on it should've been,
it should've.

1397
01:21:25.560 --> 01:21:28.080
So I'm like,
well,
I don't know what the hell to tell you I'm going to take off.

1398
01:21:28.081 --> 01:21:30.420
I guess you'll deal with him.
He's like,
you're not fucking leaving them here.

1399
01:21:30.421 --> 01:21:34.530
I don't want him to pull a Belushi on me.
And I'm like,
what?
And I'm like,
Oh fuck.

1400
01:21:34.610 --> 01:21:38.400
So now I've gotta like get him up and walk him out and throw them in the car.

1401
01:21:38.401 --> 01:21:41.400
And he was big and I get them back to the house.
We go in,

1402
01:21:41.530 --> 01:21:42.560
he doesn't even do the coke.

1403
01:21:42.660 --> 01:21:45.570
He ends up crawling on the floor in the living room and just lay it on the floor

1404
01:21:45.571 --> 01:21:46.404
and passing out,

1405
01:21:47.010 --> 01:21:50.660
which is something he did a lot because that house became the party house eats

1406
01:21:51.090 --> 01:21:55.170
raped in the scarves and 12 fucking head wraps.
Not yet.
I mean this is early Sam.

1407
01:21:55.171 --> 01:21:58.320
So it was still just a trench coat and the cap dude,
this is not,

1408
01:21:58.321 --> 01:22:01.920
this is pre rock and roll.
Sam.
He's,
I don't have any story that can match this.

1409
01:22:02.680 --> 01:22:05.970
[inaudible] the falling out was,
was the better story.

1410
01:22:06.480 --> 01:22:09.990
I mean cause like that year,
well how does that night then he just passes out,

1411
01:22:10.140 --> 01:22:12.270
you passes out and then,
you know,
he wakes up and then,
you know,
we'd,

1412
01:22:12.630 --> 01:22:13.411
we'd build this bond.

1413
01:22:13.411 --> 01:22:16.080
I get sucked into the Kennison and entourage and I'm now like,
you know,

1414
01:22:16.081 --> 01:22:19.560
doing my graduate work and cutting coke for Sam Kennison and,

1415
01:22:19.890 --> 01:22:23.340
and it was my job at that point to organize the party.

1416
01:22:23.341 --> 01:22:25.230
Like Sam would do this every Monday night.

1417
01:22:25.231 --> 01:22:29.040
It became very taxing because I knew he was coming in.

1418
01:22:29.041 --> 01:22:32.550
What would happen is he'd show up in the fucking party would start and like you

1419
01:22:32.551 --> 01:22:33.271
show up at the store,

1420
01:22:33.271 --> 01:22:36.000
he'd give me a couple of hundred bucks and I'd go by all the booze and

1421
01:22:36.001 --> 01:22:39.150
cigarettes and mixers that everyone needed to bring up to the house.

1422
01:22:39.270 --> 01:22:40.680
So I would get into this pattern.

1423
01:22:40.681 --> 01:22:42.900
After a while I knew how long the party could go on for.

1424
01:22:42.901 --> 01:22:46.360
It could go on for two or three days.
You 15 years.
I didn't,
I had no idea.

1425
01:22:46.460 --> 01:22:47.790
You did this stuff.
Yeah.
So like,

1426
01:22:47.791 --> 01:22:51.000
so I used to get this shit so I'd go buy all this booze,

1427
01:22:51.001 --> 01:22:54.720
but I know what would happen is that he'd show up with 20 people and then come

1428
01:22:54.721 --> 01:22:59.490
day two or three.
It just be me and Sam and some freaks like you know,
you know,

1429
01:22:59.491 --> 01:23:03.210
it ended up like eight people.
So I would hide the liquor all around the house.

1430
01:23:03.370 --> 01:23:05.840
Now when you up for the three days that mark for,

1431
01:23:06.430 --> 01:23:08.750
how the fuck did you write any jokes?
Well,

1432
01:23:08.770 --> 01:23:11.050
I was only working the belly room and you know,
we were all in the,

1433
01:23:11.051 --> 01:23:11.884
and we were on the,

1434
01:23:11.920 --> 01:23:14.860
in the comedy store at school in the same school where she's like,
you know,

1435
01:23:14.861 --> 01:23:17.530
you lived your life as hard as possible when you got up there and you fucking

1436
01:23:17.531 --> 01:23:20.760
did the work.
Well there's other newer comedians resent you that you,

1437
01:23:20.761 --> 01:23:24.190
you got into the Sam's because like at that time,
you know,
it was like,

1438
01:23:24.191 --> 01:23:27.550
who the fuck would want to be in that entourage?
I mean at that time,
you know,

1439
01:23:27.560 --> 01:23:30.530
the,
the guy who used to be Mitsis assistant was like,
uh,
you know,

1440
01:23:30.540 --> 01:23:33.100
he used to call us some Nance and family because you know,

1441
01:23:33.101 --> 01:23:36.520
Sam was like this weird charismatic freak that dwelled in the underworld.

1442
01:23:36.640 --> 01:23:39.250
In most of the comics.
There were,
you know,
were sort of like,
you know,

1443
01:23:39.251 --> 01:23:42.880
just working comics.
I mean,
he was one of a kind.
That's what always blew my mind.

1444
01:23:42.881 --> 01:23:47.380
If I can just stop this for just half a second was where did guys like Seinfeld

1445
01:23:47.770 --> 01:23:50.440
fit in?
Cause he was around during that time.
Like,

1446
01:23:50.441 --> 01:23:55.270
I just can't imagine like that universe where there was like a level of partying

1447
01:23:55.270 --> 01:23:58.620
.
He wouldn't,
he would just come in.
But he was singular in that,
you know,
he,
he,

1448
01:23:58.640 --> 01:24:01.390
he,
you know,
he was,
you know,
he celebrated it.
I mean,

1449
01:24:01.391 --> 01:24:02.700
there's a lot of comics as you know,

1450
01:24:02.860 --> 01:24:05.940
and as we all know that had their abusive substance of problems,
but you know,

1451
01:24:05.950 --> 01:24:07.630
they would try and hide it and just do their job.

1452
01:24:07.631 --> 01:24:10.270
There were plenty of hacky comics that were fucked up on drugs,

1453
01:24:10.510 --> 01:24:15.040
but the fact that Sam had to live the life as the beast,
like out of the beast,

1454
01:24:15.340 --> 01:24:19.270
he had the honor it.
So he was the first one that,
that was shameless about it.

1455
01:24:19.271 --> 01:24:21.040
And then you'd see all these other comics that you,

1456
01:24:21.041 --> 01:24:24.130
I don't need to drop names or mention names where they'd come around and,

1457
01:24:24.210 --> 01:24:25.630
you know,
they'd hang out and do some well,

1458
01:24:25.631 --> 01:24:28.030
but they wouldn't want to be tagged with it.
You know,

1459
01:24:28.031 --> 01:24:30.730
there was a lot of guys that would hang out and do coke and be like,
you know,

1460
01:24:30.731 --> 01:24:33.670
don't tell nobody,
you know.
I mean,
I saw a lot of that.

1461
01:24:33.820 --> 01:24:35.890
I mean there are certain people that would come up and party with us and we

1462
01:24:35.891 --> 01:24:36.880
weren't allowed to do drugs.

1463
01:24:36.881 --> 01:24:39.170
Like one time Ted Nugent was hanging around and Sam was like,

1464
01:24:39.190 --> 01:24:40.410
no drugs because Ted's gleaned.

1465
01:24:40.480 --> 01:24:43.220
So we had to sit there and I'll behave ourselves for the three hours at Nugent.

1466
01:24:43.221 --> 01:24:46.280
Sat there and talked,
told me wild boar stories.
Well he sent me,

1467
01:24:46.400 --> 01:24:47.530
still hold court at this house.

1468
01:24:47.531 --> 01:24:50.950
So I'd go out and stock up the place and set up the party and then he'd come up

1469
01:24:50.951 --> 01:24:52.510
with all his freaks and then it just,

1470
01:24:52.511 --> 01:24:56.050
a lot of times I'd end up just me and him and two or three people and eventually

1471
01:24:56.800 --> 01:25:00.010
I started to lose my mind and I wasn't progressing as a comic,

1472
01:25:00.011 --> 01:25:01.930
I was losing a lot of weight.
I was sleep deprived,

1473
01:25:01.931 --> 01:25:05.470
I was driving poor fuckers to the airport and Mitsis when they had to go play

1474
01:25:05.471 --> 01:25:06.820
the dunes because that was part of my,

1475
01:25:07.210 --> 01:25:10.300
my job to work at the store was to drive the guys to the airport.

1476
01:25:10.301 --> 01:25:13.870
I remember one time I was driving,
you know,
Mendoza and camp and naira to the,

1477
01:25:13.900 --> 01:25:17.650
to the Burbank airport because they had to go play the comedy store that was at

1478
01:25:17.651 --> 01:25:18.640
the dunes at that time.

1479
01:25:18.730 --> 01:25:21.250
And I'd been up all night and there was no gas and I could've killed those

1480
01:25:21.251 --> 01:25:25.800
fucking guys.
A Christ.
So like,
so what ultimately started happening,

1481
01:25:25.810 --> 01:25:28.660
I started losing my mind,
you know,
you get to sleep deprived,
too much drugs.

1482
01:25:28.661 --> 01:25:31.630
He started to hear voices,
start hearing voices in your head and you know,

1483
01:25:31.720 --> 01:25:33.010
and you're,
you're a conspiracy guy.

1484
01:25:33.040 --> 01:25:37.540
I had a mystical conspiracy organized around Sam and Hollywood and how I,

1485
01:25:37.541 --> 01:25:40.390
you know,
like I used to do this bit about how like,
you know,

1486
01:25:40.391 --> 01:25:43.090
I thought I was special.
I didn't think it was a sickness because you know,

1487
01:25:43.300 --> 01:25:46.570
when you hear voices in your head,
it's never one.
It's always many.

1488
01:25:46.571 --> 01:25:49.150
And you spend a lot of time trying to get them to pick a fucking leader.

1489
01:25:49.390 --> 01:25:51.580
You know,
if someone's got something to say and step to the front of the head,

1490
01:25:51.581 --> 01:25:52.600
I need instructions.

1491
01:25:53.230 --> 01:25:57.730
So I'm losing my mind and thank fucking God.
You know,
uh,

1492
01:25:58.480 --> 01:26:02.470
shit hit the fan.
Uh,
ultimately after almost a year of this living like this,

1493
01:26:03.230 --> 01:26:05.960
you know,
uh,
you know,
Sam had a know he,
you know,

1494
01:26:06.200 --> 01:26:09.740
every week for a year you were up for three days straight.

1495
01:26:09.940 --> 01:26:12.340
And totally once I got out,
unless I went out,
well y'all,

1496
01:26:12.610 --> 01:26:15.320
Tim now to through dia two days,
but you'd have to take breaks.
I mean,
it wasn't,

1497
01:26:15.410 --> 01:26:17.900
he'd go on the road.
I mean,
it wasn't that steady,
but you know,

1498
01:26:18.110 --> 01:26:22.910
it was part of a cycle because even when he was gone,
we were all hopped up and,

1499
01:26:23.270 --> 01:26:26.150
uh,
like he'd do weird shit,
you know.
I mean,
the one time,
you know,

1500
01:26:26.151 --> 01:26:28.270
there's this chick,
I remember one night at the table,

1501
01:26:28.290 --> 01:26:30.260
there was some girl like sitting at the table,

1502
01:26:30.261 --> 01:26:31.400
you never knew who showed up there.

1503
01:26:31.401 --> 01:26:33.590
And I started to get that creepy feeling like someone's going to die and it

1504
01:26:33.591 --> 01:26:36.560
might be me because there was too much weirdness going on up there.

1505
01:26:36.830 --> 01:26:38.900
And I remember one night like,
um,

1506
01:26:40.070 --> 01:26:43.340
some chick was at the table and she had a bandaged wrists,
you know,

1507
01:26:43.341 --> 01:26:46.730
and I didn't know when she was all wasted and like,
uh,
you know,
so I said,

1508
01:26:46.731 --> 01:26:49.820
why is your risk bandage?
And she goes,
well,
I tried to kill myself.
And I said,

1509
01:26:49.821 --> 01:26:51.350
well,
why don't you do the other wrist?
And she does,

1510
01:26:51.530 --> 01:26:55.550
cause I didn't want to fuck up my watch.
And I'm like,
what?
And then she,

1511
01:26:56.240 --> 01:26:57.880
she goes,
I just remember.

1512
01:26:57.910 --> 01:27:01.250
So like she goes into the other room and passes out in a couple of hours later,

1513
01:27:01.610 --> 01:27:04.520
sparky comes out to me and goes,
I think Sam pissed on that girl.
And I'm like,

1514
01:27:04.521 --> 01:27:07.030
what are you talking about?
And be like,
she was laying and Todd's Ben,

1515
01:27:07.180 --> 01:27:08.240
there was piss all over the place.

1516
01:27:08.360 --> 01:27:11.840
And Sam at this weird thing where occasionally he pissed on things.
It was just,

1517
01:27:12.050 --> 01:27:15.860
he was weird.
So this is really killing my Sam Kinison all right,
go ahead.
Well,

1518
01:27:15.861 --> 01:27:19.400
here's the,
here's the story though.
I like,
I didn't know he did the drugs.

1519
01:27:19.401 --> 01:27:21.380
I just don't need to know the peeing.
Well,
this is the,

1520
01:27:21.381 --> 01:27:22.960
this is the punchline of the story and I know,

1521
01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:24.680
I apologize if people have heard this story,

1522
01:27:24.681 --> 01:27:29.520
but it is sort of comedy lore that interests you.
Okay.

1523
01:27:30.300 --> 01:27:33.570
They used to be this guy that hung around the comedy store.
He was a satanist.
He,

1524
01:27:33.580 --> 01:27:37.460
his name was Dave London and uh,
I'm,
I should fictionalize his name.

1525
01:27:37.461 --> 01:27:40.460
His name was Dave.
I don't know.
It's too whatever.

1526
01:27:40.670 --> 01:27:42.680
So this guy had like a Pentagram tech I,

1527
01:27:42.681 --> 01:27:45.140
you said his whole name and then he goes,
I'm going to fictionalize it.

1528
01:27:45.140 --> 01:27:48.770
And he just said,
just his real first time.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I'm just trying to help out.

1529
01:27:49.190 --> 01:27:51.080
I don't want to hurt anyone's feelings or get myself in trouble.

1530
01:27:51.170 --> 01:27:54.560
So this guy had a pentagram tattooed on his heart.
He had six,
six,
six on his arm.

1531
01:27:54.561 --> 01:27:56.490
He had the mark of the Illuminati on the other arm.

1532
01:27:56.560 --> 01:27:58.970
He looked like Christopher walk and he was a dope fiend and he used to hang

1533
01:27:58.971 --> 01:28:00.870
around the store and we couldn't get rid of them.

1534
01:28:00.871 --> 01:28:03.680
You now the story is that attracts these fucking people in there.
There,
there,

1535
01:28:03.710 --> 01:28:07.560
there will be.
There's no,
that's just that open hallway where people just did.

1536
01:28:07.680 --> 01:28:12.410
But it's also,
it's a psychic drain for fucking dark,
weird people.
You know,

1537
01:28:12.411 --> 01:28:16.490
it's a home that it's for the,
for the people who don't fit in,

1538
01:28:16.491 --> 01:28:20.160
fit in at the store,
you know,
which is why I love it so much.
But this,

1539
01:28:20.230 --> 01:28:23.390
you guys used to hang around and Sam hated him.
I don't,
I never knew really why?

1540
01:28:24.710 --> 01:28:27.050
So one night,
you know,
a couple of nights,

1541
01:28:27.051 --> 01:28:30.780
I can't remember if it was a couple of days before his HBO special premiered.
Uh,

1542
01:28:30.820 --> 01:28:32.270
you know,
he brought all his guitars and shit.

1543
01:28:32.271 --> 01:28:35.690
He played guitar up to the House and we had this big jam session and out on the

1544
01:28:35.691 --> 01:28:38.730
patio.
It was great.
Sam brought him up.
Sam,
Sam,

1545
01:28:38.810 --> 01:28:40.520
just setting up the story and you know,

1546
01:28:40.521 --> 01:28:43.850
he took off and I'd put all the equipment in my bedroom because Sam,

1547
01:28:43.900 --> 01:28:46.130
do you want to take it home?
So a couple of nights after that,

1548
01:28:46.131 --> 01:28:50.000
we have a party at the house,
you know,
Sam's up there and this Guy Dave,

1549
01:28:50.001 --> 01:28:53.540
the Satan shows up and we're all doing drugs and it's getting weird and they're

1550
01:28:53.541 --> 01:28:55.700
sitting at the table and everyone,
he's holding court.

1551
01:28:55.701 --> 01:29:00.440
Sam isn't in Dave's there in a few other people.
And,
and Dave,
the Satan says,

1552
01:29:00.441 --> 01:29:03.120
you know,
like they're getting into it about satanism like,
you know,

1553
01:29:03.300 --> 01:29:06.840
it's like the beast versus the mini beast.
It was ridiculous.
And then Dave goes,

1554
01:29:06.841 --> 01:29:09.480
I'm going to tell the Anton levay about you.
You're not a real satanist.

1555
01:29:09.960 --> 01:29:13.500
And Sam just like stands up.
And this was a common tactic he used in fighting.

1556
01:29:13.740 --> 01:29:17.760
He stands up,
he throws a drink in this guy's face and pops him.
Oh,
that's good.

1557
01:29:17.910 --> 01:29:20.650
Yeah.
That's like the old throw salt and the guy that does it.
Sand.
Yeah.

1558
01:29:21.060 --> 01:29:23.970
And there's a fight.
There's a scuffle.
And then,
you know,
and then I'm like,

1559
01:29:24.050 --> 01:29:24.930
you know,
I break it up in,

1560
01:29:24.931 --> 01:29:27.480
Dave's all fucked up and all the other people in the room are freaked out.

1561
01:29:27.481 --> 01:29:30.120
And Dade,
the Satan is his shirts all ripped up.
And I'm like,

1562
01:29:30.210 --> 01:29:31.980
you gotta get Outta here,
man.
Needs you to got to get out of here.

1563
01:29:32.040 --> 01:29:34.720
You've got to get out of his face.
He's like,
I'm not fucking,
we even fuck that.

1564
01:29:34.780 --> 01:29:35.090
And I'm like,

1565
01:29:35.090 --> 01:29:37.860
well I got to leave cause I gotta pick up a buddy of mine at the airport.

1566
01:29:38.250 --> 01:29:40.470
I don't know what the hell to do it yet.
So I lock him in my room.

1567
01:29:42.450 --> 01:29:45.390
I locked him in my room with the guitars.
That sounded like a good idea to me.

1568
01:29:45.391 --> 01:29:45.780
Right.

1569
01:29:45.780 --> 01:29:48.840
So I have to leave because my buddy's flying in and I told him I'd been hanging

1570
01:29:48.841 --> 01:29:51.630
out with Sam and this guy was high right now.
Oh,
of course I will always high.

1571
01:29:52.150 --> 01:29:54.660
So I got to go pick my buddy up at the airport and I'd been telling him all

1572
01:29:54.661 --> 01:29:57.780
about Sam,
you know,
and,
and this guy was in Boston and he's like,
yeah,

1573
01:29:57.781 --> 01:29:59.760
I used to do coke with him too.
And he was excited to come out.

1574
01:29:59.970 --> 01:30:01.950
So I pick them up at the airport,
we go to his hotel and I'm like,

1575
01:30:01.980 --> 01:30:03.780
I want to stay out there.
I don't want to go back tonight.

1576
01:30:03.781 --> 01:30:07.650
I'm going to crash at the hotel.
So I crashed at the hotel.
All right.

1577
01:30:08.070 --> 01:30:11.280
And then we drive back to the house,
you know,
me and my buddy in the morning,

1578
01:30:11.460 --> 01:30:14.580
all right,
God.
And we walk in and it's like,
you know,

1579
01:30:15.380 --> 01:30:19.350
if I walk into my room and it's been,
you know,
it,
the door had been kicked in,

1580
01:30:19.440 --> 01:30:22.320
the beds all fucked up,
all the equipments gone.
And I'm like,
Oh fuck.

1581
01:30:22.321 --> 01:30:23.040
What happened?

1582
01:30:23.040 --> 01:30:26.730
That walk into the living room and there Sam sitting with two or three other

1583
01:30:26.731 --> 01:30:31.440
people,
a weird mix of people and they'd been at it all night,
you know.

1584
01:30:31.441 --> 01:30:34.500
And I walk in and I'm with my friend and I'm like,

1585
01:30:34.501 --> 01:30:37.650
this is my buddy bill and Sam just sitting there.
He goes,
Marin,

1586
01:30:38.610 --> 01:30:41.520
I pissed on your bed.
You want to know why?

1587
01:30:44.010 --> 01:30:48.200
And I go,
yeah,
I do want to know why Sam.
He goes,
cause you let that Evie,

1588
01:30:48.330 --> 01:30:49.770
it's sweep with my guitars.

1589
01:30:51.270 --> 01:30:54.030
And I know that apparently I turned to my friend bill and I said,

1590
01:30:54.090 --> 01:30:55.200
I told you I knew him.

1591
01:31:00.420 --> 01:31:03.710
That was the last time I ever slept in that bed.
And I,
and then I,
that was,

1592
01:31:03.720 --> 01:31:06.440
I did the guy fuck up his guitars and everything like that.
Oh,

1593
01:31:06.530 --> 01:31:09.110
we didn't do anything.
Sam just had his fucking freak out.
You know,

1594
01:31:09.350 --> 01:31:12.680
it's manic psychotic cocaine for guy.
I don't know what the hell transpired,

1595
01:31:13.160 --> 01:31:16.450
but I never signed,
knew him.
I never slept in that bed again.

1596
01:31:16.820 --> 01:31:18.860
A couple of days later I snapped at the store in,

1597
01:31:18.861 --> 01:31:21.050
lost my shit and I packed up everything.

1598
01:31:21.320 --> 01:31:24.740
I went up to the coke dealer who was not the,
the hairdresser at this point.

1599
01:31:24.741 --> 01:31:27.890
He was just Palestinian dude who was kind of scary.
And I said,
I don't get it,

1600
01:31:27.891 --> 01:31:30.500
man.
I'm kicked out of the group,
man.
What the fuck am I gonna do?

1601
01:31:30.501 --> 01:31:32.810
And the coke dealer,
Shit,
you gotta get Outta here,
man.

1602
01:31:32.870 --> 01:31:35.930
You got to start your own thing.
And when the drug dealers telling you to leave,

1603
01:31:35.990 --> 01:31:38.900
yeah.
You gotta lead.
Yeah.
So I pack up my car,

1604
01:31:38.901 --> 01:31:42.230
I gave away everything and go find Jesus son back up my car.

1605
01:31:42.231 --> 01:31:45.590
And I think I'm hearing voices and um,
you know,
and I,
and I leave,
I leave,

1606
01:31:45.591 --> 01:31:47.510
I call my brother and two sides and I'm fucked up.

1607
01:31:47.511 --> 01:31:49.700
I'm coming to stay with you for a few days.
Do I get straightened out?

1608
01:31:49.701 --> 01:31:52.430
I got to go clean up.
And,
uh,
you know,

1609
01:31:52.550 --> 01:31:56.300
is this Christ you sound like slash yeah.
Well,
so fucking unbelievable.

1610
01:31:56.301 --> 01:32:00.040
I was 21 years old,
dude.
I was 21 old and I,
can I

1611
01:32:00.040 --> 01:32:04.000
<v 5>just pause for one second now all you guys,
uh,
who,
no one,
you know,</v>

1612
01:32:04.001 --> 01:32:07.330
listen to this podcast a lot and I talk about my early days of stand up.

1613
01:32:07.480 --> 01:32:11.620
I swear to God,
Mark,
when I started stand up in Boston,
Massachusetts,

1614
01:32:11.800 --> 01:32:14.680
I started the two,
well,
the amount of,
of headliners,

1615
01:32:14.681 --> 01:32:19.390
I would say like 65% of the headliners that I work with in my first three years,

1616
01:32:20.060 --> 01:32:24.160
they're opening line to their set was so,
uh,
I've been sober for six months.
Yeah.

1617
01:32:24.280 --> 01:32:27.430
Everybody was in fucking Aa.
Everybody had cleaned up.

1618
01:32:27.610 --> 01:32:31.240
And half of those guys were,
um,
were,

1619
01:32:31.270 --> 01:32:35.410
what should gum dude on the Mike there,
the,
the,
uh,
half of those guys were like,

1620
01:32:36.070 --> 01:32:38.560
um,
uh,
like their,

1621
01:32:38.561 --> 01:32:42.260
their wages were getting garnished by the IRS because they were making like four

1622
01:32:42.690 --> 01:32:44.790
for granted.
Those guys like Sweeney and uh,
you know,

1623
01:32:44.880 --> 01:32:47.230
I don't want to name names here.
That's one of the things on the podcast.

1624
01:32:47.231 --> 01:32:50.320
We don't name names,
I've got to tell you that shit.
So they,
they basically,
yeah.

1625
01:32:50.321 --> 01:32:51.820
Like these guys had fucking,
you know,

1626
01:32:51.821 --> 01:32:56.260
they'd be making four grand cash every fucking weekend for 10 years and didn't

1627
01:32:56.261 --> 01:32:57.850
pay a diamond taxes.
Right.

1628
01:32:58.060 --> 01:33:01.660
And then all of them basically couldn't leave Massachusetts unless they got a

1629
01:33:01.661 --> 01:33:06.640
written note from the IRS.
Yeah.
Or some shit.
So by the time I came in,

1630
01:33:07.660 --> 01:33:12.030
the rebellious thing to do was to go on stage sober.
Oh.
If it was kind of,

1631
01:33:12.380 --> 01:33:14.920
well maybe I should even say rebellious.
It was the norm.

1632
01:33:14.921 --> 01:33:17.560
So when I came in and the guys I started out with,

1633
01:33:17.561 --> 01:33:19.960
and I'll mention names here just because I'm not saying anything bad,

1634
01:33:19.961 --> 01:33:24.490
but I started off with Dane and Patrice and like those guys just didn't drink.

1635
01:33:24.491 --> 01:33:28.240
And I came from a,
like me and my friends,
we were a bunch of booze bags.
Yeah.

1636
01:33:28.300 --> 01:33:32.800
And when I came in,
they didn't drink and I saw how fucked up these guys were,

1637
01:33:32.860 --> 01:33:36.730
you know,
who messed up.
Yeah.
And,
and you know,
and some of them had some regret,

1638
01:33:36.731 --> 01:33:38.800
not all of them,
but some of them were there.
I should have done that yet.

1639
01:33:38.801 --> 01:33:42.580
So I immediately equated with,
oh,
getting fucked up is stupid.

1640
01:33:42.970 --> 01:33:46.990
And so I started my whole career,
I started off,
you know,
work totally clean.

1641
01:33:47.350 --> 01:33:50.710
And I went and I was,
and I was totally sober.
And then a fucking,

1642
01:33:51.160 --> 01:33:53.860
this year I had to actually go on the wagon for like two and a half months.

1643
01:33:53.890 --> 01:33:56.890
I Dunno what happened.
Touring,
touring did it to me.
No,
if it breaks you down,

1644
01:33:56.891 --> 01:34:00.070
it's a tough racket.
But you know,
I mean,
I always wanted to be that.
I mean,
I,

1645
01:34:00.071 --> 01:34:03.120
you know,
before I got to La,
I always want him to be,
you know,
I,

1646
01:34:03.170 --> 01:34:06.460
all my heroes were fucks up.
We were fucked up.
You know,
all my heroes,
all,

1647
01:34:06.461 --> 01:34:08.920
you know,
all the comics,
you know,
all everyone,
I respect.

1648
01:34:08.921 --> 01:34:12.490
Why is it so romantic that that whole fucking cause I'm sitting cause I'm

1649
01:34:12.491 --> 01:34:15.010
sitting there going like,
even as fucked up as that story is,

1650
01:34:15.220 --> 01:34:19.300
I'm sitting there like feeling like I'm like show business light because I don't

1651
01:34:19.301 --> 01:34:22.160
have any stories of being up for fucking three days and,
and,
and,

1652
01:34:22.161 --> 01:34:25.300
and I'm old enough to know I don't want those fucking stories,

1653
01:34:25.301 --> 01:34:27.880
but you just don't want to have a boring autobiography.
You know,

1654
01:34:27.881 --> 01:34:29.170
when you do that,
when the comedian,

1655
01:34:29.410 --> 01:34:32.140
when you finally hit and they give you the book deal and you've got to have you

1656
01:34:32.250 --> 01:34:35.260
in your head on your hand,
like,
well,
you know,
my take on life,

1657
01:34:35.560 --> 01:34:38.420
the truth of the matter is,
is that,
you know,
it doesn't help you and you,

1658
01:34:38.421 --> 01:34:40.540
you know,
and if you stay doing that,
it will kill you.

1659
01:34:40.690 --> 01:34:44.310
There's no way around it that no,
but you want to have a couple of fucking stone.

1660
01:34:44.920 --> 01:34:46.840
That's a great story.
Oh,
there's another story.

1661
01:34:46.841 --> 01:34:49.690
When I was hanging out with Sam [inaudible] to Aa meetings just to fucking

1662
01:34:49.691 --> 01:34:53.500
listen to yell.
You should Tommy Lee.
I mean I've been sober for over 10 years.

1663
01:34:53.890 --> 01:34:58.360
Over 10 years.
Just,
you haven't done anything?
No.
I,
you know,
I got,
I got straight

1664
01:34:58.430 --> 01:35:01.460
<v 6>and got into the program,
you know,
you know,
learned how to rewire my brain.</v>

1665
01:35:01.610 --> 01:35:05.540
I've done nothing.
I'm a sober guy 10 years.
Yeah.
But you know,
whatever.

1666
01:35:05.720 --> 01:35:06.070
But you know what?

1667
01:35:06.070 --> 01:35:08.000
You're a cool sober guy cause I didn't even know that about you.

1668
01:35:08.600 --> 01:35:11.450
I mentioned to somebody last night to get gun.
Yeah.
You know,
I was,
I,
you know,

1669
01:35:11.451 --> 01:35:13.700
I didn't drink for two and a half months and then I went to England.
I was like,

1670
01:35:13.701 --> 01:35:17.420
I got to try these spirits and beers and now I'm like bummed when I go three

1671
01:35:17.421 --> 01:35:18.760
fucking days.
And I was like,
fuck.

1672
01:35:18.761 --> 01:35:22.010
I was up to like 75 and then all of a sudden he just got real serious.
He goes,

1673
01:35:22.060 --> 01:35:22.893
do you want to get sober?

1674
01:35:23.360 --> 01:35:26.100
Like really like looking into my soul and my Jesus Christ,
dude,
no,
I'm,

1675
01:35:26.140 --> 01:35:29.090
I'm not like that.
No,
the only question is,
is like,
look,
you know,

1676
01:35:29.091 --> 01:35:30.630
I don't care what anyone does,
you know,
and,

1677
01:35:30.680 --> 01:35:34.850
and I certainly appreciate the process of drinking and boozing and doing drugs.

1678
01:35:35.060 --> 01:35:39.200
I loved it,
but,
you know,
it really just comes down to,
if you get to that point,

1679
01:35:39.550 --> 01:35:42.770
he,
the only time you need to get sober really is if you all of a sudden,

1680
01:35:42.890 --> 01:35:46.040
you know,
try to stop and you can't,
or you like becomes unmanageable.
That's it.

1681
01:35:46.280 --> 01:35:49.020
You know?
And then that's when you need help.
That's it.
You know,

1682
01:35:49.040 --> 01:35:53.980
this is where I'm at.
I'm,
I'm,
uh,
I have stopped and done,

1683
01:35:54.410 --> 01:35:58.820
you know,
but like,
I don't want to stop.
It's not that I can't,

1684
01:35:59.210 --> 01:36:01.910
I like it.
Like last night I'm sitting there doing the Gig.

1685
01:36:02.180 --> 01:36:05.330
It was a place I always wanted to perform at.
I fucking destroyed.

1686
01:36:05.750 --> 01:36:08.210
I even yelled out of blues brothers line.
Yeah.

1687
01:36:08.420 --> 01:36:11.420
That John Belushi said on stage and in the Nolan got it.

1688
01:36:11.421 --> 01:36:14.390
But I did it for me and I just said a fucking great time,
you know?

1689
01:36:14.480 --> 01:36:19.040
And afterwards I got this big ice chest of fucking Heineken's just staring at me

1690
01:36:19.041 --> 01:36:23.270
and I didn't drink one because I knew that,
you know,
I didn't want one.

1691
01:36:23.271 --> 01:36:25.820
I wanted one of the drink all of them,

1692
01:36:26.090 --> 01:36:30.860
and then stuffed my face into the ice when I was done.
So I,
I,
I,

1693
01:36:31.090 --> 01:36:34.550
I like it the way I like cookies.
I want to eat the whole fucking bag.
All right,

1694
01:36:34.551 --> 01:36:38.720
so then you know what that's called was set alcoholism?
No,
it is,
I'm kidding.
No,

1695
01:36:39.200 --> 01:36:42.800
but tell me that.
Denial.
I'm not an alcoholic.
No,
no.
Look,

1696
01:36:42.920 --> 01:36:46.560
the bottom line is you can do it however you want.
It's like he,

1697
01:36:46.580 --> 01:36:49.970
a lot of people you have to understand something about people in the program is

1698
01:36:49.971 --> 01:36:52.730
that most of them,
you know,
who are especially gung ho about it,

1699
01:36:52.890 --> 01:36:56.930
it's saved their fucking life.
And it does every fucking day.
That's it.
You know?

1700
01:36:56.931 --> 01:36:58.730
And it's,
you know,
that's really interesting.

1701
01:36:58.731 --> 01:37:02.450
So now I'll be more forgiving of somebody who they're like fanatics of any kind,

1702
01:37:02.451 --> 01:37:04.280
but they're not trying to push Jesus on you.
I mean,

1703
01:37:04.281 --> 01:37:08.660
part of the program is really,
it's based on helping other alcoholics.

1704
01:37:08.661 --> 01:37:13.370
So they actually,
when they do that in a way,
you know,
you know,

1705
01:37:13.970 --> 01:37:15.980
uh,
in terms of,
of the way the program works,

1706
01:37:15.981 --> 01:37:20.300
it's helping them see it teaches pathologically self centered people who can't

1707
01:37:20.301 --> 01:37:24.320
control themselves to behave like,
like regular people by helping other people.

1708
01:37:24.380 --> 01:37:27.830
I mean a very specific way.
So yeah,
that's it.
You know what I mean?
It's not,

1709
01:37:27.831 --> 01:37:28.580
usually they don't,

1710
01:37:28.580 --> 01:37:32.440
it's not a hard line thing and no one's ever going to come up to you.
Like why?

1711
01:37:32.450 --> 01:37:34.700
I've actually really though,
uh,

1712
01:37:34.850 --> 01:37:39.850
monitored my drinkings because I'm so fucking vain.
I liked the,
uh,
the,

1713
01:37:39.851 --> 01:37:43.130
the hot,
my face looks a lot better when you drink,
when I don't.
Oh,

1714
01:37:43.340 --> 01:37:47.810
cause when I don't cause I lose,
I lose that.
Sure.
However you want it.
And then,

1715
01:37:47.960 --> 01:37:50.450
you know,
the thing is,
is like if it's not destroying your wife,
so be it.

1716
01:37:50.810 --> 01:37:52.880
And if you want to go up and down and quit here and there,

1717
01:37:52.881 --> 01:37:56.010
and if it's not destroying your life,
that's it.
Yeah.
Like after I go do

1718
01:37:56.010 --> 01:37:58.470
<v 5>this,
my Easter dinner is going to be,
I'm gonna go to somebodies house.</v>

1719
01:37:58.560 --> 01:38:00.810
I'm gonna Watch going to watch the red sox Yankees.
It's great.

1720
01:38:00.840 --> 01:38:02.590
Now how the fuck am I not mine

1721
01:38:03.610 --> 01:38:06.480
<v 6>to,
the thing is,
is it really comes down to,
yeah,
in,
in,
in,</v>

1722
01:38:06.510 --> 01:38:09.540
in light of what you're talking about.
If you've tried this,

1723
01:38:09.541 --> 01:38:13.560
stop with all your heart over and over again because you want to stop drinking

1724
01:38:13.860 --> 01:38:16.890
and you can right then,
then it's something to be addressed.

1725
01:38:16.891 --> 01:38:19.140
If you want to take a break,
but you like to drink,

1726
01:38:19.141 --> 01:38:22.620
but it's not ruining your life and you're just a weird kind of controlling guy

1727
01:38:22.740 --> 01:38:24.870
in your mind.
And you're like,
fuck,
I had two months and you know,

1728
01:38:24.871 --> 01:38:27.270
but if it's not a plague bucket,

1729
01:38:27.370 --> 01:38:30.970
<v 5>this is,
this is what's killing me.
I had a buddy of mine,
uh,
he,</v>

1730
01:38:30.971 --> 01:38:34.750
he quit for a minute and I swear to God,
like,
he's one of these guys who quit.

1731
01:38:34.751 --> 01:38:36.820
I'm like,
dude,
what the fuck are you equipment for you?
You don't have a problem.

1732
01:38:36.821 --> 01:38:38.650
Okay.
This guy quit for like,

1733
01:38:38.700 --> 01:38:42.520
I may be 17 days and I think he lost about 30 pounds.
And I was like,

1734
01:38:42.890 --> 01:38:47.890
chats is Christ.
Yeah,
you will fucking Busan.
And he looked great.
Yet he usually,

1735
01:38:47.891 --> 01:38:51.790
you know what he looked like?
He loves like an Oscar,
but that's uses the exact,

1736
01:38:51.910 --> 01:38:54.600
I can't wait to hit him with that one.
If you didn't,
if you knew this guy.
Yeah.

1737
01:38:54.660 --> 01:38:59.590
You look literally liked his body,
the silhouette of an Oscar.
And uh,

1738
01:38:59.680 --> 01:39:02.680
and then one day call me and say,
you know,
I started drinking.

1739
01:39:02.700 --> 01:39:05.470
I realized I didn't have a problem.
I just was drinking too much and blah,
blah.

1740
01:39:05.770 --> 01:39:08.710
So now he's back on the drinking.
Okay.
I saw him again at dude,

1741
01:39:08.711 --> 01:39:10.540
he looked like fucking hell.

1742
01:39:11.110 --> 01:39:15.760
He looked like he got run over by a bus man.
Terrible.
The tricky business.

1743
01:39:15.790 --> 01:39:20.760
It's a tricky shit,
man.
Yeah.
Like he just look,
uh,
he,
you know,

1744
01:39:20.780 --> 01:39:23.180
he looked like when he stopped drinking for three weeks,
you know,

1745
01:39:23.220 --> 01:39:25.570
all those fucking shows as I do on makeover.
Yeah,

1746
01:39:25.630 --> 01:39:27.060
we're going to give you a new hip haircut.

1747
01:39:27.190 --> 01:39:30.400
We're gonna give you a shiny shirt and all of a sudden you come walk up.
Yeah,

1748
01:39:30.630 --> 01:39:32.860
yeah,
no.
And all of a sudden the women's start paying and that's,

1749
01:39:32.861 --> 01:39:33.920
that's what he looked like.

1750
01:39:34.540 --> 01:39:39.040
He came down to the club and even my girlfriend was like,
Jesus,
look at you.
Wow.

1751
01:39:39.260 --> 01:39:41.200
This is the thing about him.
He didn't go to the fucking gym.

1752
01:39:41.710 --> 01:39:44.540
He just stopped drinking.
Yeah.
So,
uh,

1753
01:39:44.590 --> 01:39:47.470
that is the one aspect of it is my face look better.

1754
01:39:47.471 --> 01:39:51.010
And then one girl told me that my skin looked great.
Yeah.
So that's,
you know,

1755
01:39:51.011 --> 01:39:55.940
I'm still fuck accuracy,
so secure and so fucking vain.
I'm like,
well,
you know,

1756
01:39:55.960 --> 01:39:58.900
I can't drink my mother.
My Skin's looking great right now.
Yeah.

1757
01:39:59.240 --> 01:40:02.560
<v 6>Hell yeah.
I,
I'm with you on that.
I mean,
I used to talk,
I talk about it a lot,</v>

1758
01:40:02.561 --> 01:40:06.230
you know,
in the sense onstage and how it is.
I mean,
like I said,
it's just I'm,

1759
01:40:06.260 --> 01:40:10.210
I'm happy I live through it because yeah,
there's a,
there's periods air,
you know,

1760
01:40:10.211 --> 01:40:11.410
and whatever anyone thinks,
you know,

1761
01:40:11.411 --> 01:40:14.900
either that's your life and that's the lifestyle you want to live or are you

1762
01:40:15.080 --> 01:40:17.980
going to make a drastic change or you just deal with the ups and downs of it.

1763
01:40:17.981 --> 01:40:19.990
But I used to say when I did,
but you can say,
you know,

1764
01:40:19.991 --> 01:40:22.990
the great thing about sobriety is how clearly you can see your disappointment.

1765
01:40:23.530 --> 01:40:24.220
Yeah.

1766
01:40:24.220 --> 01:40:25.053
<v 5>The</v>

1767
01:40:26.460 --> 01:40:31.180
thing I was joking about is how fucking long a year is.
Yeah.
When you're sober,

1768
01:40:31.240 --> 01:40:35.290
it's like,
I remember every second of this other than when I was sleeping.

1769
01:40:35.291 --> 01:40:38.550
It's like,
it was like February 2nd I can't believe it's not may yet.
Yeah.

1770
01:40:38.730 --> 01:40:41.890
It's just fucking insane.
I like that though.
I,
I,
you know,
as I get older,

1771
01:40:41.891 --> 01:40:45.340
I'd much rather time just drip by then rush by.
Know it's brutal.

1772
01:40:45.400 --> 01:40:47.680
I don't even know what happened this last fucking decade,
but I think,

1773
01:40:47.770 --> 01:40:50.830
I think we're getting close to what are we up to there on your arguing computer?

1774
01:40:50.950 --> 01:40:54.070
How many,
how many minutes?
I don't know.
We have no idea.
No,
it's three 20.

1775
01:40:54.071 --> 01:40:57.910
What time did we start?
About two 15.
Yeah,
we might be a little bit over now.

1776
01:40:57.940 --> 01:41:00.280
You want to do it?
Uh,
yeah.
Well let me,
let me,
let me,

1777
01:41:00.580 --> 01:41:01.580
let me give it a chance here.

1778
01:41:01.680 --> 01:41:04.120
Are you listening to mark Marin and just for the future when I do these

1779
01:41:04.121 --> 01:41:05.050
interviews?
So,
uh,

1780
01:41:05.110 --> 01:41:09.250
it's always uncomfortable given other comedians compliments where we were such

1781
01:41:09.830 --> 01:41:12.190
self-loathing people.
But I think seriously,
mark,
for my,
for my money,

1782
01:41:12.640 --> 01:41:15.820
you've always been one of one of the fucking best comics in the country.

1783
01:41:15.821 --> 01:41:19.210
So if mark is coming to your area,
definitely go see him.
He's,

1784
01:41:19.211 --> 01:41:22.870
he does not pander to the audience.
He says what the fuck he wants to say.

1785
01:41:22.871 --> 01:41:25.870
I think you're fucking awesome.
And every comic from here on out,

1786
01:41:26.230 --> 01:41:28.750
if they're on my show,
they fit that bill.

1787
01:41:28.751 --> 01:41:30.400
I don't know if there'll be able to follow your stories,

1788
01:41:30.401 --> 01:41:32.200
but every once in a while we're going to do this on the podcast.

1789
01:41:32.201 --> 01:41:35.800
I'm going to have a comedian that I really admire and I admired your work for a

1790
01:41:35.801 --> 01:41:37.750
long time.
So how about,
let me know some of the gigs.

1791
