understanding.

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:34.590

to succeed on Google Play.

With it, you can discover
insights from Google

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:51.340
to help you develop
and launch your app,

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:55.920
engage and grow your audience,
and earn more revenue.

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.920

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.030
and comes with lots of new

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.580

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.290

and publish your updates to give
your users a smooth transition

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:23.830

Adobe recently announced their
plans to end support for Flash

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:45.560
in late 2020.

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.740
For Flash developers, this will
mean transitioning to HTML,

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:51.680
as Chrome will increasingly
require explicit permission

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:55.280
from users to run Flash content
until support is removed

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.770
completely at the end of 2020.

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:59.870
For some links to help
make the transition,

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:02.250
