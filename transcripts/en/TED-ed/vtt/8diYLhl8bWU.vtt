00:00:06.728 --> 00:00:11.616
What do Charles Darwin, Michael Jordan,
and Yoda have in common?

00:00:11.616 --> 00:00:16.623
They, like many other historical
and fictive individuals, are bald,

00:00:16.623 --> 00:00:19.034
in some cases by their own choice.

00:00:19.034 --> 00:00:23.151
For centuries, a shining dome has been
a symbol of intelligence,

00:00:23.151 --> 00:00:28.644
but despite this, many balding people
still wish their hair would return.

00:00:28.644 --> 00:00:30.662
Scientists have long pondered,

00:00:30.662 --> 00:00:35.322
"Why do some people lose their hair,
and how can we bring it back?"

00:00:35.322 --> 00:00:41.643
The full-headed among us have about
100,000 to 150,000 hairs on our scalps,

00:00:41.643 --> 00:00:45.566
and scientists have discovered two things
about this dense thicket.

00:00:45.566 --> 00:00:50.194
Firstly, the sprouting hair we see
is mostly made up of keratin,

00:00:50.194 --> 00:00:54.745
the protein leftover from dead cells
that are forced upwards

00:00:54.745 --> 00:00:57.319
as new cells grow beneath them.

00:00:57.319 --> 00:01:00.119
Secondly, the structures 
that drive hair growth

00:01:00.119 --> 00:01:02.076
are called hair follicles,

00:01:02.076 --> 00:01:06.572
a network of complex organs
that forms before we're born,

00:01:06.572 --> 00:01:10.260
and grows hair in an everlasting cycle.

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.483
This cycle has three main phases.

00:01:12.483 --> 00:01:15.728
The first is anagen, the growth phase,

00:01:15.728 --> 00:01:20.741
which up to 90% of your hair follicles
are experiencing right now,

00:01:20.741 --> 00:01:24.980
causing them to push up hair
at a rate of one centimeter per month.

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:29.573
Anagen can last for two to seven years,
depending on your genes.

00:01:29.573 --> 00:01:31.371
After this productive period,

00:01:31.371 --> 00:01:36.316
signals within the skin instruct
some follicles to enter a new phase

00:01:36.316 --> 00:01:39.819
known as catagen, or the regressing stage,

00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:44.413
causing hair follicles to shrink
to a fraction of their original length.

00:01:44.413 --> 00:01:47.299
Catagen lasts for
about two to three weeks

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:51.993
and cuts blood supply to the follicle,
creating a club hair,

00:01:51.993 --> 00:01:54.147
meaning it's ready to be shed.

00:01:54.147 --> 00:01:57.609
Finally, hairs enter telogen,
the resting phase,

00:01:57.609 --> 00:01:59.894
which lasts for ten to twelve weeks,

00:01:59.894 --> 00:02:03.978
and affects about 
5-15% of your scalp follicles.

00:02:03.978 --> 00:02:08.862
During telogen, up to 200 club hairs
can be shed in a day,

00:02:08.862 --> 00:02:10.333
which is quite normal.

00:02:10.333 --> 00:02:13.411
Then, the growth cycle begins anew.

00:02:13.411 --> 00:02:15.795
But not all heads are hairy,

00:02:15.795 --> 00:02:19.700
and, in fact, some of them grow
increasingly patchy over time

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.430
in response to bodily changes.

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:28.029
95% of baldness in men can
be attributed to male pattern baldness.

00:02:28.029 --> 00:02:29.825
Baldness is inherited,

00:02:29.825 --> 00:02:31.594
and in people with this condition,

00:02:31.594 --> 00:02:36.983
follicles become incredibly sensitive
to the effects of dihydrotestosterone,

00:02:36.983 --> 00:02:40.014
a hormonal product 
made from testosterone.

00:02:40.014 --> 00:02:45.052
DHT causes shrinkage 
in these overly sensitive follicles,

00:02:45.052 --> 00:02:47.750
making hair shorter and wispier.

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:49.804
But loss isn't sudden.

00:02:49.804 --> 00:02:54.042
It happens gradually, along a metric
known as the Norwood Scale,

00:02:54.042 --> 00:02:57.287
which describes the severity of hair loss.

00:02:57.287 --> 00:02:59.758
First, hair recedes along the temples,

00:02:59.758 --> 00:03:04.574
then hair on the crown begins to thin
in a circular pattern.

00:03:04.574 --> 00:03:06.794
At the highest rating on the scale,

00:03:06.794 --> 00:03:10.981
these balding areas meet 
and expand dramatically,

00:03:10.981 --> 00:03:15.300
eventually leaving only a ring
of sparse hair around the temples

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:17.158
and the back of the head.

00:03:17.158 --> 00:03:19.577
Genetics isn't all that drives hair loss.

00:03:19.577 --> 00:03:24.162
Long periods of stress can release
signals that shock follicles

00:03:24.162 --> 00:03:27.635
and force them into 
the resting phase prematurely.

00:03:27.635 --> 00:03:30.470
Some women experience this
after childbirth.

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:35.980
Follicles might also lose the ability
to go into anagen, the growth phase.

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:40.892
People going through chemotherapy
treatment temporarily experience this.

00:03:40.892 --> 00:03:42.825
But while balding may look permanent,

00:03:42.825 --> 00:03:46.520
scientific investigation 
has revealed the opposite.

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:48.253
Below the skin's surface,

00:03:48.253 --> 00:03:52.502
the roots that give rise to our hair
actually remain alive.

00:03:52.502 --> 00:03:53.965
Using this knowledge,

00:03:53.965 --> 00:03:57.342
scientists have developed drugs
that shorten the resting phase,

00:03:57.342 --> 00:04:00.105
and force follicles into anagen.

00:04:00.105 --> 00:04:02.699
Other drugs combat male pattern baldness

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:06.973
by blocking the conversion 
of testosterone to DHT

00:04:06.973 --> 00:04:10.386
so that it doesn't affect 
those sensitive follicles.

00:04:10.386 --> 00:04:13.914
Stem cells also play a role in regulating
the growth cycle,

00:04:13.914 --> 00:04:17.250
and so scientists are investigating
whether they can manipulate

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:23.263
the activity of these cells to encourage
follicles to start producing hair again.

00:04:23.263 --> 00:04:24.423
And in the meantime,

00:04:24.423 --> 00:04:27.240
while scientists hone 
their hair-reviving methods,

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:30.770
anyone going bald, 
or considering baldness,

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:33.734
can remember that 
they're in great company.
