said this is ridiculous because nothing

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:14.810
said this is ridiculous because nothing
 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:16.270

question can you send a message this way
 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.550
question can you send a message this way
and the answer is probably no you see

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:27.560
and the answer is probably no you see
 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.770

it's not Morse code you can't send a

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:40.580
it's not Morse code you can't send a
 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:42.490
it's not Morse code you can't send a
love letter from one part of the

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:42.500
love letter from one part of the
 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.290

universe to another part of the universe

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:44.300
universe to another part of the universe
 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:46.300

faster than the speed of light because a

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:46.310
faster than the speed of light because a
 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:48.610
faster than the speed of light because a
love letter has net information

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:48.620
love letter has net information
 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:51.130
love letter has net information
so in some sense maybe Einstein has the

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:51.140
so in some sense maybe Einstein has the
 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:54.130
so in some sense maybe Einstein has the
last laugh it does mean that we have to

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:54.140
last laugh it does mean that we have to
 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.040
last laugh it does mean that we have to
revise the famous statement nothing can

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:57.050
revise the famous statement nothing can
 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:59.200
revise the famous statement nothing can
go faster than the speed of light now

00:01:59.200 --> 00:01:59.210
go faster than the speed of light now
 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:02.530
go faster than the speed of light now
what we have to say is no usable

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:02.540
what we have to say is no usable
 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:05.860
what we have to say is no usable
information can travel faster than the

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:05.870
information can travel faster than the
 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:07.719
information can travel faster than the
speed of light so in some sense

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:07.729
speed of light so in some sense
 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:11.979
speed of light so in some sense
Einstein still has the last laugh
