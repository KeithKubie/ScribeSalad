00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:06.630
The intensity and suffering exacted by a heartbreak
depends not only on the core fact that we’ve

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:14.180
been left; it also decisively depends on how
we’ve been left. Our hurt can be hugely

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:20.650
intensified when we’ve been left badly – just
as it may be rendered a great deal more bearable

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:26.119
when we are fortunate enough to have landed
on a lover who has learnt the psychologically-rich

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:33.320
art of mature break-ups. There are certain
things guaranteed to make a break up worse

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:40.469
than it ever needs to be: (i) Lingering: All
decisions around relationships should be taken

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:46.219
with the awareness that life is desperately
short for both parties. It therefore really

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:50.840
shouldn’t matter if the holiday has already
been booked or if preparations for our birthday

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:56.460
are – awkwardly – well under way. As soon
as the decision is taken, a courageous lover

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:02.210
will not dither out of a misplaced desire
not to upset pre-existing plans. They know

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:06.530
they must leave. They are ruining things,
of course, but they can see that the holiday

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:11.729
or restaurant meal would in any case be doomed
– and they are kind enough to know not to

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:20.810
waste any more of our precious time. (ii)
Collateral Accusations A wise departing lover

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:27.079
knows not to accuse the other of more sins
than they are guilty of. It is not, they know,

00:01:27.079 --> 00:01:31.899
our fault that their career is going wrong
and we truly aren’t responsible for their

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:37.399
insomnia or the conflicts with their brother.
The wise lover keeps the list of accusations

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:43.229
down to the specific problems that necessitated
a break-up; they don’t use the parting as

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:48.840
an occasion to rehearse all that happens to
be a bit wrong with us – an inevitably far

00:01:48.840 --> 00:02:01.899
longer but irrelevant charge sheet.(iii) Deceptive
Niceness The most harmful lovers are those

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:08.170
who labour under a misplaced impression that
they need to be nice – even when they are

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:14.220
firing us. But there is, in fact, no need
for honeyed words, we simply require the basic

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:21.000
information and then some privacy to put ourselves
back together again. Indeed, ongoing niceness

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.760
simply confuses us all the more. The tenderness
makes us ache to restart the relationship,

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:34.609
for there seems no reason why not, given how
they are behaving. (iv) Evasiveness Clumsy

00:02:34.609 --> 00:02:39.079
lovers are so scared of the news they have
to share with us, they cannot bear to come

00:02:39.079 --> 00:02:46.079
out with – and let it seep out in odd symptomatic
ways. They start drinking too much, or come

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:51.660
home very late, or advance odd-sounding theories
about relationships. They hope – through

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:57.959
their strange and harmful behaviour – to
be fired rather than have to resign. In sly

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:05.370
and unfair ways, they seek to push us to take
the agonising next step. On the other hand,

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:11.000
there is so much that can spare us excessive
pain at the end: (i) Directness Kind departing

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.920
lovers make a sharp break. Once they’ve
decided, they move swiftly to letting us know;

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:20.420
they clear off quickly; they don’t hold
out hints of reconciliation; they don’t

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:24.799
suggest that if we changed in certain ways,
they’d reconsider. It’s awful, of course,

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:30.239
but there’s a vein of mature kindness in
their brusque manner: in an obviously difficult

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:39.719
situation, they are sparing us the extended
torture of false hope. (ii) Reasons Good departing

00:03:39.719 --> 00:03:45.489
lovers try to explain in convincing ways why
the relationship didn’t work out. They might

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:50.249
point out, for instance, that you are both
really quite anxious by nature – and therefore

00:03:50.249 --> 00:03:55.390
struggle to soothe and calm each other. This
isn’t so much a complaint about you as on

00:03:55.390 --> 00:04:01.060
observation about why the fit between you
as a couple wasn’t very helpful. Or they

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:05.479
may explore the ways in which the two of you
have powerfully divergent attitudes to money

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:10.040
– and hence are set on a serious collision
course. They’re not saying you are horrendous

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:15.940
or a fool – just that the two of you turn
out not to be very adept partners for each

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:23.490
other. (iii) Honesty about who they are Nice
departing lovers let us see and actively remind

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:29.169
us of what’s not so nice or good about them.
They admit that they brought a lot of difficult

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:33.770
things into the relationship. They admit,
perhaps, that they’re obsessed by work;

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:37.810
they may acknowledge they are bossy or very
controlling; they might be open about their

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:43.669
unfaithful nature. They are doing us the kindness
of showing us that life with them would be

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:49.020
seriously difficult in major ways. We’re
losing them, but we’re not losing the prospect

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:51.200
of a blissful or problem-free future.

00:04:55.040 --> 00:05:00.160
Good departing lovers
know that the news they are breaking will,

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:06.000
inevitably, lead to them being hated for a
time. They are brave in the face

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:11.110
of this. They don’t suffer from the fateful
and sentimental desire to be loved by people

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:17.740
they no longer love. We’re gradually disentangling
two distinct sources of pain – which mean

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:22.370
very different things. There’s the sorrow
of losing someone we liked. But there may

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:27.810
well also be the suffering caused by the unfortunate
ways a lover acted at the end.

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:30.770
We
may not be able to escape the agony of broken

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:36.560
hearts but we can always strive to keep it
to a very basic minimum.
