Hi, I’m John Green, this is Crash Course Literature
and today we continue our discussion of Hamlet.

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:10.200
Mr. Green, Mr. Green, I’ve figured it out already. Hamlet has an Oedipus complex. That explains everything.

00:00:10.209 --> 00:00:15.289
No, no, no Me From the Past. As we’ve already
learned, not even Oedipus had an Oedipus complex.

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:18.010
Although your fascination with it is starting
to freak me out a little.

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:22.369
And while you can read Hamlet as being entirely
about sex, sex, sex, sex, sex, you don’t

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:24.730
have to.
I’ll give you this though Me From The Past,

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:28.370
whether or not Hamlet wants to sleep with
his mother, he definitely has girl trouble.

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:37.160
[Theme Music]

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:43.800
So Hamlet’s pretty vicious to the women in this play. He orders Ophelia, for instance, to “get thee to a nunnery!”

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:50.320
And he tells his mother Gertrude: “frailty, thy
name is woman,” even though Hamlet isn’t terribly

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.379
robust, as you may have noticed.
Now there’s been some backlash discussing

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:57.460
gender dynamics in literature, but this is
a really important contemporary approach to

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:01.059
the study of literature. It’s not the only
one. It’s not the only one that we do here.

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:04.779
But it is one that matters.
So a basic reading of Hamlet would look like this:

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:09.580
Claudius has and uses power, Hamlet
has power but mostly chooses not to use it,

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:15.170
Polonius has less power than he imagines himself
to have, and Ophelia and Gertrude have no

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:19.750
power. Right? Yeah, not exactly.
Let’s go to the Thought Bubble.

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:24.250
So in painting, there’s a tradition of depicting
Ophelia as a tragic, romantic, completely

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:28.590
powerless heroine, following the mythology
created by Gertrude when she describes Ophelia’s

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.170
death in extensive detail.
How she “fell in the weeping brook. Her

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:38.880
clothes spread wide, / and mermaid-like awhile
they bore her up […] till that her garments,

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:44.460
heavy with their drink, / pull’d the poor
wretch from her melodious lay / to muddy death”

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.740
Did Gertrude actually see this? Probably not.
And if she did, why didn’t she to try to

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.820
save Ophelia instead of coming up with a lovely
simile about how much she looks like a mermaid

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.619
while she drowns?
Gertrude’s description makes Ophelia’s

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:00.860
death sound like an accident. A branch broke
and she plunged helplessly into the water.

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:04.259
Could have happened to anyone hanging out
on a riverbank wearing lots of layers.

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:08.860
But pretty much everyone else accepts Ophelia’s
death as a deliberate suicide caused by her

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:13.780
madness. So that raises the question: What
kind of agency did she have since she clearly

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:18.440
had some and how did she use it? And, also,
what caused her madness?

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.760
Thanks, Thought Bubble.
So before Hamlet escapes into madness he’s

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:26.330
in a difficult spot. He’s heir to a throne
that should be his already, son to a mother

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:32.400
he no longer trusts, nephew to the guy who
possibly killed his dad. Well, Ophelia is

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.330
in a pretty tight spot too.
I mean, Ophelia’s father has been murdered

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:41.020
by Hamlet, who used to be in love with her,
and who is now shouting at her about nunneries

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:45.050
and then making weird sexual banter
and then going off to sea.

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:49.010
It’s like if that guy, who you’re totally
not sure is your boyfriend, killed your dad

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:53.510
and then still sort of wanted to be your boyfriend,
but only sometimes, we’ve all been there.

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:58.380
In Act 2, Polonius says of Hamlet, “though
this be madness yet there is method in’t”

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:03.750
and let’s not overlook the method in Ophelia’s
madness. Like, towards the end of Act 4, she

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:08.440
hands out flowers she has collected to Claudius,
Gertrude, and Laertes.

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:12.120
These flowers each have meanings that would
be known to the Elizabethan audience, who

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:15.520
were the kind of people who liked their bouquets
to contain secret codes.

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:20.290
“There’s fennel for you, and columbines,”
says Ophelia, presumably to Gertrude as Fennel

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:23.850
signified flattery and Columbines marital
infidelity.

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:28.900
She also hands out rue, which signified repentance,
and mentions that the violets –associated

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:32.290
with faithfulness – “withered all when
my father died.”

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:37.330
This is Ophelia at her most deliciously subversive,
delivering her own form of judgment, speaking

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:42.790
out against corruption and injustice and doing
it in her own particularly feminine way behind

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:46.480
the mask of seeming madness.
So while Hamlet’s off on some pirate ship

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:51.680
giving yet more soliloquies about his indecisiveness,
Ophelia is asserting her own beliefs about

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:56.610
right and wrong and life and death, and she’s
doing it in a way that’s clear. I mean,

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:00.590
at least it would be clear to Elizabethans.
But then, she tragically decides to inflict

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:05.390
this judgment on her own body, viewing her
death as the only way to free herself from

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:09.300
Elsinore’s depravity and depression.
Quick personal sidenote: I think that is a

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:14.300
terrible decision and a poor use of Ophelia’s
agency. As bad as her her use of the flowers

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:19.420
is good. Suicide is a permanent solution to
a temporary problem. Even in Ophelia’s case.

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:23.200
So there’s very popular reading of Hamlet
that Ophelia’s suicide is an assertive choice,

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:27.510
the only choice she really can make. But,
in fact, the flowers show that she can also

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:30.040
make other choices.
Now of course those choices might have resulted

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:34.210
in her death anyway, but the choice was there.
All that noted, there’s no question that

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:40.640
while Hamlet is stuck between to be or not
to be, Ophelia actively chooses NOT to be.

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:44.620
She makes her peace with death, and she does
it a whole act before Hamlet does.

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:48.960
So without Ophelia we’re left with the other
woman in the play, Queen Gertrude. Gertrude’s

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:52.790
quickie marriage to Claudius forces Hamlet
to think a lot more than he would want to

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:56.210
about his mother’s sexuality. Or maybe it’s
exactly as much as he wants to.

00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:01.250
Hamlet sees Gertrude’s hookup with Claudius
as a betrayal of his father but also of Hamlet

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:05.060
himself, because it deprives him of the throne.
So it’s not fair to say that Gertrude has

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:09.710
no power or agency, she has the one vote in
the election for who becomes king.

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:13.460
But does her choice make Gertrude a traitor?
I mean is she complicit in her husband’s

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:18.350
murder or is she just another victim of
Claudius’s sweet, sweet, poisonous lies?

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:22.750
And this is where the oedipal reading comes
in, like is Hamlet angry at Claudius because

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:28.370
Claudius has done what Hamlet always secretly
wanted to do. You know, kill the father, marry

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:32.340
the mother, become king.
And he does focus pretty intently on Gertrude’s

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:36.530
“incestuous sheets,” but most of the time
he’s hesitating to kill Claudius, it’s

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:40.780
because he doesn’t want to become a murderer
not because of anything about what’s happening

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:43.300
between the sheets.
For a character with not that many lines,

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:49.080
Gertrude is very interesting. Like is her
ultimate loyalty to Hamlet or to Claudius?

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:52.900
Shakespeare presses this idea in the duel
scene when Gertrude — either inadvertently

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:56.650
or on purpose — saves Hamlet’s life,
if only for like a minute.

00:05:56.650 --> 00:06:01.310
Gertrude reaches for Hamlet’s poisoned cup,
and Claudius orders her not to drink, but

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:05.590
her only response is “I will, my lord, I
pray you pardon me.”

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:09.020
Is she just thirsty or is that a conscious
choice?

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:13.490
In her final moments, is she showing Hamlet
where her allegiance lies? Now, of course,

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:19.020
Shakespeare meant this to be ambiguous but
her final line is, “O my dear Hamlet!”

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:22.110
not “O my dear Claudius.”
Now both Gertrude and Ophelia’s defiance

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:26.360
of authority ultimately results in their suicide.
And I want to underscore that I don’t think

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:30.430
suicide is heroic, but the most interesting
discussion question in my high school English

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:34.740
classes was, “Which of these characters, in
Hamlet, is the most heroic?”

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:38.310
I think you can make a case for almost anyone,
except for Polonius and of course Claudius.

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:41.610
But there’s certainly a case to be made
for Gertrude or Ophelia. Anyway, this leads

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:46.050
us to the question whether heroism always
involves taking heroic actions. Certainly,

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:50.570
Hamlet’s a big fan of action. I mean not
in his own life, but, you know, as an idea.

00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:54.250
I mean he describes man as “in action how
like an angel.”

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:58.720
But then he shows that this image of angelic
man is inaccessible to him, even repellent,

00:06:58.730 --> 00:07:01.990
saying “and yet to me, what is this quintessence
of dust?”

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:05.389
And then of course smack dab in the middle
of the play Hamlet lectures the traveling

00:07:05.389 --> 00:07:12.720
players about how best to act. And then Hamlet
doesn’t act, for scene after scene, after scene.

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:16.990
Except when he stabs Polonius who,
while annoying, is innocent.

00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:21.500
But is this indecision meant to be seen as
heroic? Like iIs Hamlet a weak and wishy washy

00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:27.050
guy for wasting all his time on investigations,
or is it in fact kind of heroic to fact-check

00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:29.790
information that you get from a ghost before
killing someone?

00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:34.270
Amleth, the inspiration for the tragedy, acts
decisively and he’s certainly seen as a

00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:37.120
hero. But it’s much more complicated in
Shakespeare’s play.

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:41.970
For one thing, as we’ve seen, ghosts were
not necessarily to be trusted, Oh… a ghost

00:07:41.970 --> 00:07:46.970
is moving my desk. It must be time for the
open letter. No, no, no, no, you no! You are

00:07:46.970 --> 00:07:51.580
not real. You are not a ghost. You are a digital
representation created by Thought Cafe. I am

00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:54.940
not giving you an open letter! Moving on!
Sorry, I’m scared of ghosts, even though

00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:58.770
they aren’t real. They definitely aren’t
real. Anyway, there’s also the fact that

00:07:58.770 --> 00:08:05.690
killing a king - even if that king is a usurper
- was generally seen as not a fantastic idea.

00:08:05.690 --> 00:08:09.240
Except when it came to Macbeth.
I mean kings were seen to rule by divine right,

00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:14.460
so offing one was an insult to god. Also,
it was in Hamlet’s best interest to keep

00:08:14.460 --> 00:08:18.730
that idea around so, you know, no one would
off him if he became king.

00:08:18.730 --> 00:08:22.639
So maybe it’s a good thing that Hamlet doesn’t
take murder lightly. Well, except for when

00:08:22.639 --> 00:08:25.990
he kills Polonius for the unforgivable
sin of hiding behind curtains.

00:08:25.990 --> 00:08:30.830
So what finally turns Hamlet into an actor?
Maybe pirates. Maybe nothing, Many critics

00:08:30.830 --> 00:08:35.020
feel that it’s a different Hamlet who shows
up in the fifth act, one who has undergone

00:08:35.020 --> 00:08:39.820
a “sea change” literally and now feels
less conflicted about his own mortality.

00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:43.460
Bit it’s not like the play immediately becomes
a Jean Claude Van Damme movie, I mean Hamlet

00:08:43.460 --> 00:08:49.120
tells Horatio “There's a special providence
in the fall of a sparrow. If it be now, 'tis

00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:54.330
not to come. If it be not to come, it will
be now.” That doesn’t sound like a guy

00:08:54.330 --> 00:08:59.060
who’s about to go on a slaughtering spree.
When Hamlet does act it’s at the last possible

00:08:59.060 --> 00:09:03.370
moment. Killing Claudius only because he has
learned that Claudius was planing to kill

00:09:03.370 --> 00:09:07.310
him, Gertrude, and Laertes.
At a certain point all that stuff about mortal

00:09:07.310 --> 00:09:11.030
and divine justice and the perpetual cycle
of violence goes out the window and you think,

00:09:11.030 --> 00:09:13.839
"Hey, maybe I should just kill this
multiple murderer."

00:09:13.839 --> 00:09:17.850
But then, of course, in doing so you re-raise
all those questions about mortal and divine

00:09:17.850 --> 00:09:21.670
justice and the perpetual cycle of violence.
Ahhh, I love Shakespeare!

00:09:21.670 --> 00:09:26.220
But one thing you can say about Hamlet is that
once he starts to take action he really takes it.

00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:30.940
He stabs Claudius with the poison sword
and forces him to drink from the poison cup.

00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:34.820
Killing him twice.
And he insults Claudius, calling him “thou

00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:39.800
incestuous, murderous, damned Dane,” which
in Elizabethan terms is quite the burn.

00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:44.900
But taking action doesn’t really resolve
or integrate Hamlet’s character. As he dies,

00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:50.510
Hamlet charges Horatio with telling his story,
as though only in death will Horatio be able

00:09:50.510 --> 00:09:55.040
to make a coherent narrative out of all of
his delay and wavering and ambivalence.

00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:59.820
If it’s revenge that made the original Amleth
famous, that’s not what keeps drawing us

00:09:59.820 --> 00:10:05.360
back to Shakespeare’s play. It’s Hamlet
inaction rather than his action that makes

00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:08.450
us pay attention.
The soliloquies in which he weighs his options

00:10:08.450 --> 00:10:13.260
and tries to decide whether he will direct
the course of his life or let fate determine

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:18.620
it teaches us something about what it means
to be human, to have a conscience, to make

00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:23.690
difficult decisions in our own lives.
Or not make them. Inaction, as Hamlet shows

00:10:23.690 --> 00:10:29.149
us, is its own kind of action. Which kind
of action is heroic? I don’t know. Tell
