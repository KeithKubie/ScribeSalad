00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.690
 
so I have two calipers or dividers

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:02.700
so I have two calipers or dividers
 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.660
so I have two calipers or dividers
they're both the same if I set them up

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:05.670
they're both the same if I set them up
 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.990
they're both the same if I set them up
you can see the jump from here we have

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000
you can see the jump from here we have
 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.209
you can see the jump from here we have
the jump from this one to this and

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219
the jump from this one to this and
 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.419
the jump from this one to this and
that's the same on this set from here to

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429
that's the same on this set from here to
 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.210
that's the same on this set from here to
here and when I line them up you see

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220
here and when I line them up you see
 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.630
here and when I line them up you see
that the second division sort of grows

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640
that the second division sort of grows
 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.150
that the second division sort of grows
at the same rate so now I've got this

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160
at the same rate so now I've got this
 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:30.650
at the same rate so now I've got this
one over here that turns up then and if

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660
one over here that turns up then and if
 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.299
one over here that turns up then and if
you are following along carefully you

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309
you are following along carefully you
 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.400
you are following along carefully you
can now actually work out what the

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410
can now actually work out what the
 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.620
can now actually work out what the
number is but let's just stay with the

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630
number is but let's just stay with the
 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.750
number is but let's just stay with the
dividers for a little bit now if I sort

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760
dividers for a little bit now if I sort
 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.910
dividers for a little bit now if I sort
of widen this out a little bit that's

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920
of widen this out a little bit that's
 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.380
of widen this out a little bit that's
lined up there and then this middle one

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390
lined up there and then this middle one
 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.600
lined up there and then this middle one
is now lined up with the gap of the

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610
is now lined up with the gap of the
 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.380
is now lined up with the gap of the
first two but this one is now land up

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390
first two but this one is now land up
 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.319
first two but this one is now land up
with these two so I'm going to widen it

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329
with these two so I'm going to widen it
 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.110
with these two so I'm going to widen it
a little bit further so that I get out

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120
a little bit further so that I get out
 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.389
a little bit further so that I get out
this one now this middle one is like

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399
this one now this middle one is like
 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.960
this one now this middle one is like
that and this last one is the fourth

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970
that and this last one is the fourth
 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.700
that and this last one is the fourth
thing are those two sets of calipers

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710
thing are those two sets of calipers
 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.149
thing are those two sets of calipers
decide they are sir if I go back to they

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159
decide they are sir if I go back to they
 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.179
decide they are sir if I go back to they
are exactly the same so we could try and

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189
are exactly the same so we could try and
 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.160
are exactly the same so we could try and
do it with one pair but it's hard to

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170
do it with one pair but it's hard to
 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.990
do it with one pair but it's hard to
line something up against itself so when

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000
line something up against itself so when
 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.080
line something up against itself so when
I look at the different possible jumps

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090
I look at the different possible jumps
 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.080
I look at the different possible jumps
from this one to here from here to here

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090
from this one to here from here to here
 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.160
from this one to here from here to here
from here to these two from these two to

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170
from here to these two from these two to
 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.230
from here to these two from these two to
these two and from these two to the full

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240
these two and from these two to the full
 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.719
these two and from these two to the full
thing it's the same ratio every time

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729
thing it's the same ratio every time
 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.940
thing it's the same ratio every time
it's that a specific ratio is it many

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950
it's that a specific ratio is it many
 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.090
it's that a specific ratio is it many
things let's find out so we sort of have

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100
things let's find out so we sort of have
 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.880
things let's find out so we sort of have
from here to here let's call that one

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890
from here to here let's call that one
 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.569
from here to here let's call that one
and then from here to here that's going

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579
and then from here to here that's going
 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:47.480
and then from here to here that's going
to be X this is a mysterious number and

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490
to be X this is a mysterious number and
 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.990
to be X this is a mysterious number and
then from here to here that's going to

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000
then from here to here that's going to
 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.050
then from here to here that's going to
be x squared because whatever proportion

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060
be x squared because whatever proportion
 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.730
be x squared because whatever proportion
we took from here to here the same

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740
we took from here to here the same
 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.010
we took from here to here the same
proportion goes from a little bit now

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020
proportion goes from a little bit now
 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:03.170
proportion goes from a little bit now
let's go from here to here and that is

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180
let's go from here to here and that is
 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.069
let's go from here to here and that is
going to be X cubed if you recall this

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079
going to be X cubed if you recall this
 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:08.529
going to be X cubed if you recall this
leap here

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:08.539
leap here
 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:12.290
leap here
fitted on to this here and now we've got

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300
fitted on to this here and now we've got
 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.520
fitted on to this here and now we've got
something which is going to give

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530
something which is going to give
 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.850
something which is going to give
an equation we can say that X cubed is

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860
an equation we can say that X cubed is
 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:21.350
an equation we can say that X cubed is
equal to X plus 1 and this might be

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360
equal to X plus 1 and this might be
 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:22.790
equal to X plus 1 and this might be
familiar to people who've seen the

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800
familiar to people who've seen the
 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.800
familiar to people who've seen the
golden ratio which is a very similar

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810
golden ratio which is a very similar
 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.660
golden ratio which is a very similar
formula but you've got an x squared here

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670
formula but you've got an x squared here
 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:30.170
formula but you've got an x squared here
if X plus 1 is X cubed we can just

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180
if X plus 1 is X cubed we can just
 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.160
if X plus 1 is X cubed we can just
multiply x + 1 so this is going to be X

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170
multiply x + 1 so this is going to be X
 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.280
multiply x + 1 so this is going to be X
to the 4 and now we can look at what

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290
to the 4 and now we can look at what
 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.040
to the 4 and now we can look at what
we've got and here I've got my x squared

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050
we've got and here I've got my x squared
 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:43.370
we've got and here I've got my x squared
and here I've got my X cubed when I

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380
and here I've got my X cubed when I
 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:48.070
and here I've got my X cubed when I
combine them together I have sort of x

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:48.080
combine them together I have sort of x
 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:53.750
combine them together I have sort of x
squared times X plus 1 and by this same

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760
squared times X plus 1 and by this same
 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.600
squared times X plus 1 and by this same
equation we get x squared times X cubed

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610
equation we get x squared times X cubed
 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:00.320
equation we get x squared times X cubed
which is X to the 5 across this whole

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330
which is X to the 5 across this whole
 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:03.800
which is X to the 5 across this whole
thing we get X to the 5 and so this

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810
thing we get X to the 5 and so this
 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:07.250
thing we get X to the 5 and so this
value of x this polynomial has three

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260
value of x this polynomial has three
 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.860
value of x this polynomial has three
solutions but two of them are complex

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870
solutions but two of them are complex
 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:11.390
solutions but two of them are complex
numbers so they're clearly not what we

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400
numbers so they're clearly not what we
 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:16.430
numbers so they're clearly not what we
want but this is one point three to five

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440
want but this is one point three to five
 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:21.620
want but this is one point three to five
and it is called the plastic ratio a bit

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630
and it is called the plastic ratio a bit
 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:23.210
and it is called the plastic ratio a bit
unfortunate as a name

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220
unfortunate as a name
 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:26.539
unfortunate as a name
well it was named before plastic was

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:26.549
well it was named before plastic was
 

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:29.030
well it was named before plastic was
named plastic and it's the old meaning

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040
named plastic and it's the old meaning
 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.250
named plastic and it's the old meaning
of plastic meaning a sort of flexible or

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260
of plastic meaning a sort of flexible or
 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.949
of plastic meaning a sort of flexible or
multi-purpose number and one of the

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959
multi-purpose number and one of the
 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:37.100
multi-purpose number and one of the
first people to investigate it Han

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:37.110

Stallone who was actually an architect

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090
Stallone who was actually an architect
 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:40.880
Stallone who was actually an architect
and a monk I think he named it the

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:40.890
and a monk I think he named it the
 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:42.620
and a monk I think he named it the
plastic ratio because he thought this

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:42.630
plastic ratio because he thought this
 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:46.430
plastic ratio because he thought this
was the real ultimate system of beauty

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:46.440
was the real ultimate system of beauty
 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.380
was the real ultimate system of beauty
that you could use for architecture and

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:48.390
that you could use for architecture and
 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:50.180
that you could use for architecture and
all that stuff and he even designed a

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.190
all that stuff and he even designed a
 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:52.340
all that stuff and he even designed a
building on the basis of it and so he

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:52.350
building on the basis of it and so he
 

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:54.229
building on the basis of it and so he
was really setting it up in opposition

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:54.239
was really setting it up in opposition
 

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:56.300
was really setting it up in opposition
to the golden ratio the real fact is

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310
to the golden ratio the real fact is
 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:58.280
to the golden ratio the real fact is
that there isn't a single number which

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290
that there isn't a single number which
 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:01.729
that there isn't a single number which
can express all beauty but this number

00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:01.739
can express all beauty but this number
 

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:03.259
can express all beauty but this number
the plastic ratio has many of

00:04:03.259 --> 00:04:03.269
the plastic ratio has many of
 

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:05.120
the plastic ratio has many of
interesting properties like the golden

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:05.130
interesting properties like the golden
 

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:07.520
interesting properties like the golden
ratio and so it is quite useful for

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:07.530
ratio and so it is quite useful for
 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:10.340
ratio and so it is quite useful for
architects to you know there's some nice

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:10.350
architects to you know there's some nice
 

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:13.250
architects to you know there's some nice
ideas to use in design so we've got

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:13.260
ideas to use in design so we've got
 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:14.840
ideas to use in design so we've got
these calipers but maybe we can look at

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:14.850
these calipers but maybe we can look at
 

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:16.909
these calipers but maybe we can look at
a couple of the other things thinking

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:16.919
a couple of the other things thinking
 

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:18.770
a couple of the other things thinking
about the golden ratio one of the things

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:18.780
about the golden ratio one of the things
 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:21.020
about the golden ratio one of the things
you can do is I can just take a square

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:21.030
you can do is I can just take a square
 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:24.380
you can do is I can just take a square
and then a build another square and then

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:24.390
and then a build another square and then
 

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:26.710
and then a build another square and then
I can put a square onto them here

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:26.720
I can put a square onto them here
 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:29.890
I can put a square onto them here
and then a square here and a square here

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:29.900
and then a square here and a square here
 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:36.250
and then a square here and a square here
and I have 1 1 2 3 5 your classic golden

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:36.260
and I have 1 1 2 3 5 your classic golden
 

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.680
and I have 1 1 2 3 5 your classic golden
spiral what would happen if instead of

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:38.690
spiral what would happen if instead of
 

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:40.780
spiral what would happen if instead of
using squares here we used equilateral

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:40.790
using squares here we used equilateral
 

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:42.880
using squares here we used equilateral
triangles I start with a Mac collateral

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:42.890
triangles I start with a Mac collateral
 

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:45.790
triangles I start with a Mac collateral
triangle put another one on there I get

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:45.800
triangle put another one on there I get
 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:48.370
triangle put another one on there I get
another one on there but now I've got a

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:48.380
another one on there but now I've got a
 

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:50.620
another one on there but now I've got a
bigger one it's gonna go there bigger

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:50.630
bigger one it's gonna go there bigger
 

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:51.190
bigger one it's gonna go there bigger
one

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:51.200
one
 

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:56.050
one
again one more over here so now the side

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:56.060
again one more over here so now the side
 

00:04:56.060 --> 00:05:00.850
again one more over here so now the side
lengths are 1 1 and 1 and then I get

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:00.860
lengths are 1 1 and 1 and then I get
 

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:03.400
lengths are 1 1 and 1 and then I get
this is going to be 2 this is the same

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:03.410
this is going to be 2 this is the same
 

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:06.760
this is going to be 2 this is the same
size so that's 2 this is 2 and 1 so

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:06.770
size so that's 2 this is 2 and 1 so
 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:11.410
size so that's 2 this is 2 and 1 so
that's 3 and this is 3 and 1 that that's

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:11.420
that's 3 and this is 3 and 1 that that's
 

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:17.200
that's 3 and this is 3 and 1 that that's
so that's 4 this one here is going to be

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:17.210
so that's 4 this one here is going to be
 

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:21.220
so that's 4 this one here is going to be
4 and 1 so that's 5 so we get instead of

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:21.230
4 and 1 so that's 5 so we get instead of
 

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:25.300
4 and 1 so that's 5 so we get instead of
the Fibonacci numbers 1 1 2 3 5 we get

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:25.310
the Fibonacci numbers 1 1 2 3 5 we get
 

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:27.310
the Fibonacci numbers 1 1 2 3 5 we get
what Accord the pad of n numbers which

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:27.320
what Accord the pad of n numbers which
 

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:33.940
what Accord the pad of n numbers which
are 1 1 1 2 2 3 4 5 the next one is

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:33.950
are 1 1 1 2 2 3 4 5 the next one is
 

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:37.990
are 1 1 1 2 2 3 4 5 the next one is
going to be 2 and 5 so that's 7 then

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:38.000
going to be 2 and 5 so that's 7 then
 

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.120
going to be 2 and 5 so that's 7 then
we're going to get 7 and 2 so that will

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:40.130
we're going to get 7 and 2 so that will
 

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:43.720
we're going to get 7 and 2 so that will
be 9 similar to the Fibonacci but you

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:43.730
be 9 similar to the Fibonacci but you
 

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:45.820
be 9 similar to the Fibonacci but you
instead of just taking the two previous

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:45.830
instead of just taking the two previous
 

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:49.920
instead of just taking the two previous
ones you skip one so I know I start

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:49.930
ones you skip one so I know I start
 

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:53.560
ones you skip one so I know I start
let's start with just 1 1 1 Fibonacci

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:53.570
let's start with just 1 1 1 Fibonacci
 

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:55.900
let's start with just 1 1 1 Fibonacci
would be 1 1 I'd add these two but I'm

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:55.910
would be 1 1 I'd add these two but I'm
 

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:57.970
would be 1 1 I'd add these two but I'm
gonna skip this and I'm gonna add these

00:05:57.970 --> 00:05:57.980
gonna skip this and I'm gonna add these
 

00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:00.850
gonna skip this and I'm gonna add these
two together so I get 2 that's the sum

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:00.860
two together so I get 2 that's the sum
 

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:03.040
two together so I get 2 that's the sum
of these 2 now I'm going to skip that 2

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:03.050
of these 2 now I'm going to skip that 2
 

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:06.730
of these 2 now I'm going to skip that 2
and add the 2 ones and that's to skip

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:06.740
and add the 2 ones and that's to skip
 

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:09.580
and add the 2 ones and that's to skip
that and add these two three skip that

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:09.590
that and add these two three skip that
 

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:18.730
that and add these two three skip that
map these 2 4 5 7 9 12 16 the effect of

having the equilateral triangle is you

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:21.500
having the equilateral triangle is you
 

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:23.140
having the equilateral triangle is you
get that skipping effect because you're

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:23.150
get that skipping effect because you're
 

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:25.930
get that skipping effect because you're
going round three sides you miss out the

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:25.940
going round three sides you miss out the
 

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:27.909
going round three sides you miss out the
side you just put in then you're

00:06:27.909 --> 00:06:27.919
side you just put in then you're
 

00:06:27.919 --> 00:06:29.860
side you just put in then you're
connecting things up how does that tie

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:29.870
connecting things up how does that tie
 

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:32.170
connecting things up how does that tie
into the plastic ratio it's a similar

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:32.180
into the plastic ratio it's a similar
 

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:35.200
into the plastic ratio it's a similar

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:35.210
rule back to the the golden ratio how
 

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:37.930
rule back to the the golden ratio how
did we find that the Fibonacci numbers

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:37.940
did we find that the Fibonacci numbers
 

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:40.600
did we find that the Fibonacci numbers
end up be

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:40.610
end up be
 

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:43.360
end up be

way you look at it is I replace this

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:45.770
way you look at it is I replace this

way you look at it is I replace this
drawing where everything is squares by

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:48.770
drawing where everything is squares by
 

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:53.080
drawing where everything is squares by
one rectangle like cut a square off and

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:53.090
one rectangle like cut a square off and
 

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:57.970
one rectangle like cut a square off and
if this is five and then one so now I

00:06:57.970 --> 00:06:57.980
if this is five and then one so now I
 

00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:01.870
if this is five and then one so now I
have a square this is one and one this

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:01.880
have a square this is one and one this
 

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:05.620
have a square this is one and one this
is length one and so this length is five

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:05.630
is length one and so this length is five
 

00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:11.200
is length one and so this length is five
minus one but because Phi minus one is

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:11.210
minus one but because Phi minus one is
 

00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:14.530
minus one but because Phi minus one is
equal to 1 over Phi so this rectangle

00:07:14.530 --> 00:07:14.540
equal to 1 over Phi so this rectangle
 

00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:17.890
equal to 1 over Phi so this rectangle
here is similar to the whole rectangle

00:07:17.890 --> 00:07:17.900
here is similar to the whole rectangle
 

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:21.400
here is similar to the whole rectangle
as I build up my spiral I get closer and

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:21.410
as I build up my spiral I get closer and
 

00:07:21.410 --> 00:07:24.310
as I build up my spiral I get closer and
closer to Phi with this it's a slightly

00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:24.320
closer to Phi with this it's a slightly
 

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:26.890
closer to Phi with this it's a slightly
more complicated set up because I've got

00:07:26.890 --> 00:07:26.900
more complicated set up because I've got
 

00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:30.010
more complicated set up because I've got
more sides there but if I look at how

00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:30.020
more sides there but if I look at how
 

00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:33.880
more sides there but if I look at how
the sides come together and I can say if

00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:33.890
the sides come together and I can say if
 

00:07:33.890 --> 00:07:36.370
the sides come together and I can say if
well if we started with one instead of

00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:36.380
well if we started with one instead of
 

00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:38.800
well if we started with one instead of
doing this addition we said this was X

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:38.810
doing this addition we said this was X
 

00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:43.120
doing this addition we said this was X
and then this is x squared this term

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:43.130
and then this is x squared this term
 

00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:46.450
and then this is x squared this term
here is now going to be one plus X so

00:07:46.450 --> 00:07:46.460
here is now going to be one plus X so
 

00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:50.260
here is now going to be one plus X so
this is X cubed but it's also one plus X

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:50.270
this is X cubed but it's also one plus X
 

00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:53.410
this is X cubed but it's also one plus X
we again get X cubed is equal to one

00:07:53.410 --> 00:07:53.420
we again get X cubed is equal to one
 

00:07:53.420 --> 00:07:56.800
we again get X cubed is equal to one
plus X which is familiar from what we

00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:56.810
plus X which is familiar from what we
 

00:07:56.810 --> 00:07:59.730
plus X which is familiar from what we
had for the plastic ratio

00:07:59.730 --> 00:07:59.740
had for the plastic ratio
 

00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:03.390
had for the plastic ratio
so I actually have a bit of a challenge

00:08:03.390 --> 00:08:03.400
so I actually have a bit of a challenge
 

00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:06.090
so I actually have a bit of a challenge
for the numberphile viewers there's

00:08:06.090 --> 00:08:06.100
for the numberphile viewers there's
 

00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:07.860
for the numberphile viewers there's
something that I came up with it's just

00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:07.870
something that I came up with it's just
 

00:08:07.870 --> 00:08:10.470
something that I came up with it's just
such a simple thing that I can't believe

00:08:10.470 --> 00:08:10.480
such a simple thing that I can't believe
 

00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:14.400
such a simple thing that I can't believe
it's not out there somewhere and so find

00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:14.410
it's not out there somewhere and so find
 

00:08:14.410 --> 00:08:16.590
it's not out there somewhere and so find
find other references to this sort of

00:08:16.590 --> 00:08:16.600
find other references to this sort of
 

00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:18.690
find other references to this sort of
idea I guess we need to come up with a

00:08:18.690 --> 00:08:18.700
idea I guess we need to come up with a
 

00:08:18.700 --> 00:08:20.520
idea I guess we need to come up with a
good Greek letter for the plastic ratio

00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:20.530
good Greek letter for the plastic ratio
 

00:08:20.530 --> 00:08:23.730
good Greek letter for the plastic ratio
pi would be be good but that's sort of

00:08:23.730 --> 00:08:23.740
pi would be be good but that's sort of
 

00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:26.970
pi would be be good but that's sort of
taken yeah - sigh the plastic with the

00:08:26.970 --> 00:08:26.980
taken yeah - sigh the plastic with the
 

00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:29.280

00:08:29.290 --> 00:08:31.110
golden ratio I cut off a square in this
case instead of cutting off a whole

rectangle so if the long side is not a
 

00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:55.740
rectangle so if the long side is not a
one this is going to be one over then

00:08:55.740 --> 00:08:55.750
one this is going to be one over then
 

00:08:55.750 --> 00:09:00.630
one this is going to be one over then
this length is going to be sy minus one

00:09:00.630 --> 00:09:00.640
this length is going to be sy minus one
 

00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:04.410
this length is going to be sy minus one
over so and we want this to be similar

00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:04.420
over so and we want this to be similar
 

00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:08.130
over so and we want this to be similar
so the length is going to be this thing

00:09:08.130 --> 00:09:08.140
so the length is going to be this thing
 

00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:12.060
so the length is going to be this thing
divided by size so that's one minus one

00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:12.070
divided by size so that's one minus one
 

00:09:12.070 --> 00:09:16.620
divided by size so that's one minus one
over sine squared this is a square so

00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:16.630
over sine squared this is a square so
 

00:09:16.630 --> 00:09:22.230
over sine squared this is a square so
this length is also sy minus one over so

00:09:22.230 --> 00:09:22.240
this length is also sy minus one over so
 

00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:24.990
this length is also sy minus one over so
now I can add these two together and I

00:09:24.990 --> 00:09:25.000
now I can add these two together and I
 

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:30.200
now I can add these two together and I
get 1 so I have 1 equals sy

00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:30.210
get 1 so I have 1 equals sy
 

00:09:30.210 --> 00:09:37.860
get 1 so I have 1 equals sy
- 1 / sy plus 1 minus 1 over sine

00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:37.870
- 1 / sy plus 1 minus 1 over sine
 

00:09:37.870 --> 00:09:41.910
- 1 / sy plus 1 minus 1 over sine
squared so now we've got 1 on both sides

00:09:41.910 --> 00:09:41.920
squared so now we've got 1 on both sides
 

00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:44.700
squared so now we've got 1 on both sides
so we can cancel those and then we're

00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:44.710
so we can cancel those and then we're
 

00:09:44.710 --> 00:09:47.160
so we can cancel those and then we're
going to multiply through by side

00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:47.170
going to multiply through by side
 

00:09:47.170 --> 00:09:56.550
going to multiply through by side
Squared's 0 and this again gives us that

00:09:56.550 --> 00:09:56.560
Squared's 0 and this again gives us that
 

00:09:56.560 --> 00:10:00.930
Squared's 0 and this again gives us that
same equation so this box if we have the

00:10:00.930 --> 00:10:00.940
same equation so this box if we have the
 

00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:02.550
same equation so this box if we have the
property that we take off a similar

00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:02.560
property that we take off a similar
 

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:05.550
property that we take off a similar
rectangle we take off a square and we're

00:10:05.550 --> 00:10:05.560
rectangle we take off a square and we're
 

00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:08.430
rectangle we take off a square and we're
left with similar rectangle has the same

00:10:08.430 --> 00:10:08.440
left with similar rectangle has the same
 

00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:10.440
left with similar rectangle has the same
proportion that we've been looking at

00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:10.450
proportion that we've been looking at
 

00:10:10.450 --> 00:10:12.180
proportion that we've been looking at
again we get the same equation

00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:12.190
again we get the same equation
 

00:10:12.190 --> 00:10:14.400
again we get the same equation

coming out you know that this idea of
 

00:10:14.410 --> 00:10:16.590
coming out you know that this idea of
the golden ratio is one that's just such

00:10:16.590 --> 00:10:16.600
