&gt;&gt;Rachel: On video, so welcome everyone to
"Authors Talks".

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:14.050
Today we have Chris Guillebeau who is here
with us to talk about his book "The $100 Startup."

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:22.870
And essentially Chris comes to us as a writer,
a world traveler he has gone to 160 countries,

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:25.430
couple more left on the list.

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:27.730
He's also an entrepreneur and lifelong learner.

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:32.859
So in addition to his book Chris is also the
author of this blog and site "The Art of Nonconformity",

00:00:32.859 --> 00:00:34.999
it's a great site to check out.

00:00:34.999 --> 00:00:41.739
Today Chris is going to talk about how anyone
can start their small startup where you can

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:48.050
commit little time or money, maybe $100 or
so and wait to take the real plunge when you're

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:49.789
sure it's successful.

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:53.089
And the best part is if we can change our
own life, we can help others change theirs

00:00:53.089 --> 00:00:55.479
which I think is a great sentiment.

00:00:55.479 --> 00:00:57.230
So please welcome Chris.

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:03.609
[Applause]
&gt;&gt;Chris: All right, thank you so much Rachel.

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:09.050
Thanks googlers for having me, both those
who are here and those who are watching.

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:13.320
It's fun to be back, I was at the Mountain
View campus last time for my first book "The

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:19.390
Art of Nonconformity" and its fun to come
and talk about "The $100 Startup".

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:23.450
In the cab on the way over all the sudden
I had this surge of guilt as I was reminded

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.619
I haven't updated my Google+ page in a couple
of weeks.

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:31.149
I was like oh shit I feel really bad, I have
to come and apologize and beg forgiveness.

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:32.890
I can take the mic out?

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:33.890
Okay.

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:39.020
So first of all my apologies for that.

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:44.159
And second of all I don't want to lecture
for a long time so I'll just talk a little

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:49.149
bit about why I wrote the book and what "The
$100 Startup" is about, tell you a couple

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:53.969
stories from it, a little bit more about the
model and what I hope will come out of it.

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:59.960
But then we'll do questions and attempted
answers, QAA which sometimes goes better than

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.640
others, but I'm sure at Google it'll be great.

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.520
And then we'll just hang out if anybody wants
to hang out, I know lots of you guys have

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:06.860
to get back to work.

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:14.820
So first things first, whenever you undertake
a project, hey guys, c'mon in.

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:19.990
Whenever you undertake a big project, whether
in business or anything else I always think

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:22.830
it's good to define your own success.

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:28.180
I always think it's good to decide for yourself
what success is gonna look like as opposed

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.530
to someone else deciding for you.

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:36.420
And in the case of writing a book, it's really
good to understand to whom you're writing.

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.730
To understand you know who the audience for
this message is.

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:44.530
And it takes a lot of work to write a book,
so who do you really hope to reach with that.

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:49.310
And there's a long tradition in publishing
of authors complaining about their publishers

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:53.440
but unfortunately I had a very good relationship
working with Crown on this book.

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:58.600
And so it's not so good for drama, but it
is good for the editorial content of the book

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:05.190
because in the beginning of the research process
I got some really good advice from my editor.

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:10.520
And my editor said, you know Chris you use
this word entrepreneur a lot on your blog

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:12.120
and in your writing.

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:18.911
And maybe in some of the circles that you
travel in, maybe online, with your blog, maybe

00:03:18.911 --> 00:03:21.930
elsewhere some people understand what you're
talking about.

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:26.640
But for a lot of mainstream America they have
their own conception of what entrepreneurship

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:27.860
is.

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:32.190
And a lot of people are actually intimidated
by the idea of entrepreneurship, and not everyone

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.740
is necessarily interested in entrepreneurship.

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:39.320
And for a lot of people when they think about
entrepreneurship, they tend to think of the

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:40.900
Silicon Valley model.

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:45.900
And they think of kind of moving and banding
together to form real company and pursuing

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.550
angel investing or venture capital.

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:53.010
And that's one model of startups, but that's
not really what the $100 startup is about

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:54.570
at all.

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:59.850
And then sometimes when people think about
"business," they think about things like wearing

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:06.640
a suit every day or playing golf or voting
Republican or all these different things that

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:10.410
you might associate with traditional larger
business.

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:13.390
And that's not what the $100 startup is about
either.

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:19.650
So essentially this book and a lot of what
I do with "The Art of Nonconformity," is for

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:21.970
those who are seeking freedom.

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:26.730
And it's for those who are hoping to have
more freedom and independence in their lives.

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:32.020
Whether it's people that are dissatisfied
in their work, people who have jobs they don't

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:34.430
like, obviously no one at Google.

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:39.660
But other companies elsewhere, people who
are dissatisfied and want to make a change.

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:43.440
But they don't necessarily know how to make
that change and they don't necessarily know

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:45.120
what the next step is.

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:51.280
And so there's a lot of resources that are
kind of general motivational encouraging people

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:53.840
to go for it and I think that's great.

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:57.540
But when you're ready to go for it, the next
question is where you going and how you get

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:58.590
there?

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:04.510
And so my hope with "The $100 Startup," was
to provide 300 pages of next steps and a very

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:10.460
specific model of checklists and case studies,
very data-driven approach, based on extensive

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:14.780
study that would tell people exactly what
to do and how to do it.

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:18.070
To establish their own small business.

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:23.400
And the second group of people that I'm writing
for in the book are those people who are just

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:29.410
now entering the job market, either just right
out of college or those who are unsuccessfully

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:32.280
trying to compete in a difficult job market.

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:34.320
People of all ages.

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:38.980
And right now we have a situation where a
lot of people, in many cases are competing

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:41.070
for few jobs.

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:45.850
And I don't know entirely what the situation
is here, I don't think it's quite as bad in

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:51.750
the Bay Area, but where I live in Portland
Oregon it's not unusual at all to go to the

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:56.890
coffee shop and your barista who makes your
coffee has a Master's degree.

00:05:56.890 --> 00:05:58.940
Or sometimes higher.

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:03.100
So it's not unusual at all to find all kinds
of people who have this higher education but

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:06.290
they're not able to find work in the field
in which they've trained.

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:11.770
It used to be that when we meet people like
this, we might think that they've fallen on

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:13.410
hard times.

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:16.571
We might even think something's wrong with
them, they're not trying hard enough, they

00:06:16.571 --> 00:06:22.440
should just work harder, they should get on
Linkedin, polish their resume whatever.

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:27.580
But I would suggest when we have situations
like last year in Portland there was a job

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:30.200
announcement for an entry-level receptionist
position.

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:37.530
It paid $14 an hour with no benefits and 300
applicants showed up to apply for that job

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:38.530
and interview.

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:39.620
Many of them have college degrees.

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:44.820
So essentially everyone is qualified or very
overqualified for that kind of job.

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:50.280
And I would suggest when we have situations
like that the answer isn't just try harder

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:51.280
for those people.

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:55.800
I would say that the answer for many of them
is actually found through creative self-employment.

00:06:55.800 --> 00:07:02.120
And the answer is found through kind of taking
matters into their own hands and making something

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:05.320
for themselves that improves the state of
the world.

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:08.850
And this used to be seen as kind of a risky
thing.

00:07:08.850 --> 00:07:12.150
Entrepreneurship used to be seen as kind of
a scary risky choice and there might be a

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:16.150
lot of rewards on the other side possibly
but there certainly is a lot of risk.

00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:21.449
And I think during a difficult economy a lot
of people are reevaluating that and thinking

00:07:21.449 --> 00:07:25.200
about where their security really is found
and what really is risky and what is really

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:26.200
safe.

00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:30.550
And for a lot of people, especially if you
can start a business without investing a lot

00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:34.870
of money and without spending a lot of time
in the planning stage.

00:07:34.870 --> 00:07:38.070
I think in many ways that's actually the safe
conservative choice.

00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:41.840
So that's the message that I'm hoping to bring
to people through the book.

00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:46.610
And the best way to tell you more about the
$100 startup model is to tell you a couple

00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:49.620
of stories from people who are in the book.

00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:55.020
So when we began at research process I was
traveling all over the world, cast a really

00:07:55.020 --> 00:08:00.990
wide net and said I want to hear from people
from all different backgrounds, from all different

00:08:00.990 --> 00:08:06.440
countries, different ages, operating different
kinds of businesses who had all successfully

00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:07.910
found this freedom.

00:08:07.910 --> 00:08:12.470
Found this independence through starting a
successful business.

00:08:12.470 --> 00:08:15.150
But we also had very specific characteristics.

00:08:15.150 --> 00:08:20.580
So we said that the business has to make at
least $50,000 a year, and in many cases it

00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:23.930
made a lot more but we just establish that
as the baseline so that we're not looking

00:08:23.930 --> 00:08:27.680
at hobbies, we're actually looking at real
small businesses.

00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:32.930
And the business owner had to provide very
specific financial information about how much

00:08:32.930 --> 00:08:37.809
money they made and how much it cost to start
the business, mistakes along the way, what

00:08:37.809 --> 00:08:41.769
went well, you know if they scale that business,
how do they do it?

00:08:41.769 --> 00:08:46.379
And again the goal with that was to provide
a very specific resource as opposed to a general

00:08:46.379 --> 00:08:47.379
resource.

00:08:47.379 --> 00:08:50.680
Because often if you ask someone how their
business is doing, assuming it's a private

00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:54.550
company or a very small business they might
say "Oh it's going well," but you have no

00:08:54.550 --> 00:08:57.670
idea what that means so we wanted to be very
specific about that.

00:08:57.670 --> 00:09:04.540
We also looked primarily at micro-businesses
or businesses that have five or fewer employees.

00:09:04.540 --> 00:09:09.019
So I really am looking at this very very small
startup model, and in most cases or let's

00:09:09.019 --> 00:09:14.149
say at least half the cases the business owners
were solo entrepreneurs.

00:09:14.149 --> 00:09:18.230
So people who were just running their business
as just one person, maybe a virtual assistant

00:09:18.230 --> 00:09:21.379
or something, but essentially it was just
themselves.

00:09:21.379 --> 00:09:25.910
And then lastly we were looking primarily
at people who started this business without

00:09:25.910 --> 00:09:31.759
a lot of advanced technical skills or without
a lot of special skills that couldn't be somewhat

00:09:31.759 --> 00:09:33.579
easily acquired.

00:09:33.579 --> 00:09:37.959
So for example we talked with a guy who opened
a coffee bar.

00:09:37.959 --> 00:09:41.040
And before he did that, he didn't know much
about running a coffee bar but he was able

00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:42.480
to acquire that knowledge.

00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:49.210
On the other hand I had someone submit a survey
from Croatia who said that he had taught himself

00:09:49.210 --> 00:09:50.480
dentistry.

00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:52.800
And I said that's great, that's awesome, good
for you.

00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:55.980
But I'm not gonna put that in the book cause
I'd probably get sued.

00:09:55.980 --> 00:10:00.879
So again no special skills or least no skills
that couldn't be easily acquired.

00:10:00.879 --> 00:10:06.499
So we received maybe 1500 submissions, lots
of data and surveys, and then from there kind

00:10:06.499 --> 00:10:14.040
of narrowed down to the 50 to 70 most interesting
or most poignant stories I felt kinda reflected

00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:15.930
the times in which we live.

00:10:15.930 --> 00:10:19.589
And then that's constructed around a narrative
in the book that tells the story of how these

00:10:19.589 --> 00:10:25.920
people found that freedom through small business
and then hopefully a blueprint for how readers

00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:27.759
can do the same thing.

00:10:27.759 --> 00:10:31.720
And one of the first people that I talked
with, in fact the book begins with the story

00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:33.670
of Michael Hanna.

00:10:33.670 --> 00:10:37.399
And Michael was a 25 year veteran sales professional.

00:10:37.399 --> 00:10:42.370
He worked in media sales and he'd always been
a good worker, got good performance reviews,

00:10:42.370 --> 00:10:44.189
really helped his firm a lot.

00:10:44.189 --> 00:10:50.300
But one day three years ago he went to work
and while he was planning his schedule, his

00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:55.079
meetings, his pitches he received a message
from his boss asking him to come and see her.

00:10:55.079 --> 00:10:59.800
And he went into his boss's office and he
noticed that she didn't make eye contact with

00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:01.279
him.

00:11:01.279 --> 00:11:07.959
And she said Michael as you know the industry
is in kind of a decline, we had to make some

00:11:07.959 --> 00:11:08.959
hard choices.

00:11:08.959 --> 00:11:14.550
And Michael said at that point it was like
everything happened in slow motion for him.

00:11:14.550 --> 00:11:17.889
And he said, you know I had heard stories
of other people who had lost their jobs, been

00:11:17.889 --> 00:11:19.339
laid off.

00:11:19.339 --> 00:11:23.630
This has happened to some of our colleagues,
it wasn't a complete surprise but until it

00:11:23.630 --> 00:11:26.750
actually happened to me I had no idea what
it felt like.

00:11:26.750 --> 00:11:30.019
And someone from HR came in and they gave
him a box, and he had to pack up his things

00:11:30.019 --> 00:11:32.689
and leave right away.

00:11:32.689 --> 00:11:37.630
And on the way home, he called his wife Mary
Ruth and he said, "Honey, I'm sure it's gonna

00:11:37.630 --> 00:11:42.379
be okay but I'm just letting you know I've
lost my job today."

00:11:42.379 --> 00:11:47.800
Everything was okay for Michael in the end,
but not in the way he first expected.

00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:55.079
So Michael thought, okay this is a shock but
I'll regroup and I will just get another job.

00:11:55.079 --> 00:12:00.009
And so he started trying to line up interviews,
talk to his colleagues and former colleagues,

00:12:00.009 --> 00:12:02.910
he used LinkedIn, he did all the things he
was supposed to do.

00:12:02.910 --> 00:12:07.519
And he got some interviews, but what he discovered
pretty quickly was he wasn't the only one

00:12:07.519 --> 00:12:10.269
looking for work first of all.

00:12:10.269 --> 00:12:14.170
And second of all because his industry was
in a decline there weren't really any companies

00:12:14.170 --> 00:12:15.989
that were hiring.

00:12:15.989 --> 00:12:18.209
So Michael began to get a little discouraged.

00:12:18.209 --> 00:12:23.939
And one day a friend of his who owned a furniture
store called him up and his friends said I

00:12:23.939 --> 00:12:29.220
know this is kind of random I have a truckload
of mattresses I don't want maybe you could

00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:33.490
take these and sell them one at a time on
Craigslist or eBay or something.

00:12:33.490 --> 00:12:38.790
So Michael called Mary Ruth again he said,
"Honey it's a long story but is it okay if

00:12:38.790 --> 00:12:40.319
I buy some mattresses?"

00:12:40.319 --> 00:12:43.239
And she said, "Okay, whatever Michael."

00:12:43.239 --> 00:12:48.600
So Michael buys the mattresses, but instead
of selling them through craigslist Michael

00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:49.739
had this other idea.

00:12:49.739 --> 00:12:54.999
While he had been driving around to all these
fruitless job interviews he had noticed a

00:12:54.999 --> 00:12:57.899
car dealership that went out of business.

00:12:57.899 --> 00:13:02.499
So Michael contacted the developer thinking
that he could probably rent that space very

00:13:02.499 --> 00:13:06.550
cheaply because there weren't any other car
dealerships coming to town during this economy.

00:13:06.550 --> 00:13:08.850
So he was able to get this space.

00:13:08.850 --> 00:13:13.819
And Michael didn't know anything about running
a mattress store, his impression was that

00:13:13.819 --> 00:13:17.100
mattress stores were kind of high pressure
seedy places you didn't really want to go

00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:18.410
to them.

00:13:18.410 --> 00:13:21.670
So he decided to create an unconventional
mattress shop.

00:13:21.670 --> 00:13:24.800
And he made a family-friendly space where
people could bring their kids, and there was

00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:27.189
a play area and there was a coffee area.

00:13:27.189 --> 00:13:31.899
And then Michael started the world's first
mattress delivery by bicycle service, which

00:13:31.899 --> 00:13:33.649
you can look up on YouTube.

00:13:33.649 --> 00:13:36.410
It's very popular bringing mattresses all
over town.

00:13:36.410 --> 00:13:43.509
And this was 2 1/2 years ago, and now Mattress
Lot is a $1 million a year business.

00:13:43.509 --> 00:13:47.929
And I talked with Michael recently right before
the book came out, and he said, "You know

00:13:47.929 --> 00:13:53.499
if someone had said to me a couple years ago
that I'd be running a mattress shop, I never

00:13:53.499 --> 00:13:55.689
would've believed it at all.

00:13:55.689 --> 00:13:58.800
But I really love what we're doing, and we're
really making a difference in our community

00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:02.839
and the whole family is involved and I feel
like I'm actually creating security for myself

00:14:02.839 --> 00:14:03.869
through this."

00:14:03.869 --> 00:14:09.759
And the other thing he said was, "That day
that I got laid off, it was a shock.

00:14:09.759 --> 00:14:11.209
It was bad.

00:14:11.209 --> 00:14:14.739
But it turned into probably the best thing
that ever happened to me, so I'm so glad that

00:14:14.739 --> 00:14:17.399
happened that caused this transition."

00:14:17.399 --> 00:14:22.259
And as I traveled the world and interviewed
lots of different people, I heard a lot of

00:14:22.259 --> 00:14:24.029
stories like Michael's.

00:14:24.029 --> 00:14:30.699
And they didn't all involve being laid off
or fired or something that difficult, but

00:14:30.699 --> 00:14:36.779
in most cases they did involve the person
kind of stumbling into their business project.

00:14:36.779 --> 00:14:42.160
Or not necessarily beginning with a hugely
strategic plan, they were just kind of pursuing

00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:45.129
an opportunity and seeing where it led.

00:14:45.129 --> 00:14:51.620
And so I learned to kind of alter the questions
that I ask people in response to this phenomenon.

00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:54.889
So I talked with Susannah Conway in England.

00:14:54.889 --> 00:14:58.980
And Susannah was a former journalist, she
was also a photographer.

00:14:58.980 --> 00:15:04.290
And at one point she decided to create a photography
course at first just for her friends and family

00:15:04.290 --> 00:15:07.540
and then everyone signed up that she knew.

00:15:07.540 --> 00:15:12.089
And she wasn't a famous blogger, she didn't
have thousands of followers on twitter or

00:15:12.089 --> 00:15:13.839
Google+.

00:15:13.839 --> 00:15:18.139
But she did have a Facebook account and she
offered her course to anyone who was connected

00:15:18.139 --> 00:15:20.249
with her, and everyone signed up.

00:15:20.249 --> 00:15:25.629
And Susannah ended up creating a $90,000 income
out of this project which is more than she

00:15:25.629 --> 00:15:27.519
had made as a journalist.

00:15:27.519 --> 00:15:33.059
And I talked to her and said, "Was there anything
that you didn't foresee when you were starting

00:15:33.059 --> 00:15:34.059
up?"

00:15:34.059 --> 00:15:36.259
And she said, "I didn't know I was starting
up.

00:15:36.259 --> 00:15:39.749
I just thought I was doing something for fun
and everyone liked it and I ended up creating

00:15:39.749 --> 00:15:42.259
this business model around it."

00:15:42.259 --> 00:15:48.019
And then I talked with Benny Lewis who's originally
from Ireland, and Benny is now a full-time

00:15:48.019 --> 00:15:52.450
professional language hacker who travels the
world learning foreign languages and teaching

00:15:52.450 --> 00:15:55.119
people through this method he's devised.

00:15:55.119 --> 00:15:58.889
And at the end of one of our conversations
I said, "Is there anything else I should know

00:15:58.889 --> 00:16:00.170
about your business?"

00:16:00.170 --> 00:16:04.350
And he said "Yes, please stop calling it a
business I'm just having the time I life.

00:16:04.350 --> 00:16:10.050
I'm just doing something that I really love
to do, but I found a way to connect that with

00:16:10.050 --> 00:16:12.829
something that's desired by the marketplace.

00:16:12.829 --> 00:16:15.899
Something that other people also value enough
to pay for."

00:16:15.899 --> 00:16:19.629
And that's how he's able to make good living.

00:16:19.629 --> 00:16:24.019
One way or another, everyone that we focused
on in this study and everyone who's in the

00:16:24.019 --> 00:16:28.749
book as well as many of the people in the
broader community that I am fortunate to work

00:16:28.749 --> 00:16:34.860
with, they've all found a way to merge that
question of passion and skill with the question

00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:36.350
of usefulness.

00:16:36.350 --> 00:16:40.249
With the idea of making something that not
only they're excited about but also other

00:16:40.249 --> 00:16:42.389
people are excited about and willing to pay
for.

00:16:42.389 --> 00:16:44.820
And they found out how to do that in different
ways.

00:16:44.820 --> 00:16:52.149
There is a story about a guy who's a full-time
CFO for a University in Virginia.

00:16:52.149 --> 00:16:56.429
And he likes his job, he has no plans to leave,
he's relatively happy there.

00:16:56.429 --> 00:17:02.519
But he's also been very passionate about travel,
and he and his wife have often traveled first-class

00:17:02.519 --> 00:17:05.860
or business-class around the world using their
frequent flyer miles.

00:17:05.860 --> 00:17:09.220
And for years he always helped his colleagues
with this, and his colleagues would ask him

00:17:09.220 --> 00:17:11.199
I want to go to Paris with my wife can you
help me?

00:17:11.199 --> 00:17:12.649
And he did this for free.

00:17:12.649 --> 00:17:18.419
And then two years ago he decided kind of
on a whim to create a very very basic website

00:17:18.419 --> 00:17:22.139
offering this as a service for anyone else
who wanted help booking their frequent flyer

00:17:22.139 --> 00:17:23.260
tickets.

00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:26.220
And he said, you know if you have miles and
you're not sure how to use them, I'll advise

00:17:26.220 --> 00:17:29.990
you on your itinerary, I'll even phone the
airline for you, whatever you want will make

00:17:29.990 --> 00:17:32.169
sure you have the trip.

00:17:32.169 --> 00:17:37.850
And long story short two years on this is
now $100,000 a year side business.

00:17:37.850 --> 00:17:43.500
And so Gary Leff this guy still works as a
CFO but for about one hour a day he operates

00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:46.510
this business that brings in $100,000 a year.

00:17:46.510 --> 00:17:52.910
And Gary says, "I like my job, I have no plans
to leave but it's actually a very good feeling

00:17:52.910 --> 00:17:57.000
to go to work because you want to go to work
as opposed to going to work because you have

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:58.000
to go to work."

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:03.110
And he said, "It is a good job, but if something
were to ever change then I have this security

00:18:03.110 --> 00:18:06.210
that we've established on the side and I could
go full-time with this."

00:18:06.210 --> 00:18:09.790
So people apply this model in different ways.

00:18:09.790 --> 00:18:15.419
Some after losing their job, some continuing
in their job, some making a gradual transition.

00:18:15.419 --> 00:18:17.990
But again all in pursuit of freedom.

00:18:17.990 --> 00:18:21.440
And they all did so for the most part without
spending a lot of money.

00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:26.070
Almost everyone in the book spent less than
$1000, about half of the stories are $100

00:18:26.070 --> 00:18:27.070
or less.

00:18:27.070 --> 00:18:31.139
I think the average startup cost was something
like $432.

00:18:31.139 --> 00:18:35.930
We decided that $432 startup didn't sound
as good as $100 startup we went with that.

00:18:35.930 --> 00:18:40.010
But the whole point is not a lot of money,
not a lot of special skills or skills that

00:18:40.010 --> 00:18:42.010
couldn't be otherwise acquired.

00:18:42.010 --> 00:18:48.840
Last story, I talked with Sarah Young in Portland
Oregon who opened a yarn shop at the height

00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:49.840
of the recession.

00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:53.700
So she opens this retail business in a nice
location just as everything else was closing

00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:54.960
down.

00:18:54.960 --> 00:19:00.120
And Sarah didn't have a lot of business experience
and so I asked her, "What were you thinking

00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:01.679
in doing this?

00:19:01.679 --> 00:19:03.450
You weren't an entrepreneur."

00:19:03.450 --> 00:19:07.980
And she said, "Well I wasn't an entrepreneur
but I was a shopper.

00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:10.659
And I knew what I wanted and it didn't exist.

00:19:10.659 --> 00:19:16.769
And I thought I wasn't the only one, and so
that's why I decided to create Happiness."

00:19:16.769 --> 00:19:20.710
And some of you may have seen the video book
trailer for "The $100 Startup" and in that

00:19:20.710 --> 00:19:26.419
trailer Sarah is there in her store and she
tells the story of her first $1000 day.

00:19:26.419 --> 00:19:30.700
She tells the story of making $1000 for the
first time and calling her dad on the phone

00:19:30.700 --> 00:19:32.799
and saying, "Dad, we had $1000 day at the
store."

00:19:32.799 --> 00:19:35.440
And she talks about just how empowering that
felt.

00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:39.730
Well we made that trailer a few months ago,
and right before the book came out I went

00:19:39.730 --> 00:19:41.240
back to her and said, "Are there any updates?"

00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:45.830
And she said, "Well we just had this big festival,
we had lots of knitters come to town and we

00:19:45.830 --> 00:19:47.980
had our first $10,000 day."

00:19:47.980 --> 00:19:52.020
So Happiness continues to grow and it has
five employees now.

00:19:52.020 --> 00:19:53.350
And it is doing very well.

00:19:53.350 --> 00:19:57.419
So again I share all these stories in the
book and in the talk and through our other

00:19:57.419 --> 00:20:02.669
work with the goal of inspiring readers to
take action.

00:20:02.669 --> 00:20:06.370
And as I said in the beginning, I think it's
important to define your own success with

00:20:06.370 --> 00:20:10.679
any project whether it's a book or business
or anything else as opposed to someone else

00:20:10.679 --> 00:20:12.760
defining that success for you.

00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:17.789
And so in the case of "The $100 Startup" I
think the book will be successful if it does

00:20:17.789 --> 00:20:18.789
a couple of things.

00:20:18.789 --> 00:20:22.570
And that first thing is inspiration combined
with action.

00:20:22.570 --> 00:20:27.500
I hope that people will read the book and
say not only was it a good book, but I hope

00:20:27.500 --> 00:20:30.750
they read and say, "I read this and then I
went and took action on it.

00:20:30.750 --> 00:20:35.190
And I started my own little micro-business,"
or "I improved the one I had," or "I helped

00:20:35.190 --> 00:20:36.769
someone else with theirs."

00:20:36.769 --> 00:20:40.100
I really hope that that inspiration will be
combined with action.

00:20:40.100 --> 00:20:41.620
Because I talk a lot about freedom.

00:20:41.620 --> 00:20:46.460
And the question I would have to all of us,
or to anyone who's watching is do you have

00:20:46.460 --> 00:20:48.049
enough freedom in your life?

00:20:48.049 --> 00:20:52.860
And are you doing most of what you love most
of the time?

00:20:52.860 --> 00:20:57.270
All of us have things that we have to do from
time to time and that's okay, but most of

00:20:57.270 --> 00:21:02.440
the time are you doing something that you
find meaningful, that's challenging and rewarding?

00:21:02.440 --> 00:21:06.970
And then because freedom and responsibility
are correlated are you making the world a

00:21:06.970 --> 00:21:07.970
better place?

00:21:07.970 --> 00:21:08.970
Are you giving enough?

00:21:08.970 --> 00:21:11.919
Do you feel like you're doing enough for yourself
and for others?

00:21:11.919 --> 00:21:17.720
The second thing that I hope for is education
for all those people who want to start something

00:21:17.720 --> 00:21:20.050
but don't know what those next steps are.

00:21:20.050 --> 00:21:25.570
The book has lots of examples and checklists
and case studies and one page business plans

00:21:25.570 --> 00:21:27.029
and promotion plans.

00:21:27.029 --> 00:21:29.850
Again just kind of helping people take those
next steps.

00:21:29.850 --> 00:21:34.389
And then the third and final thing that I
hope will come out of the book is I hope it

00:21:34.389 --> 00:21:38.580
will create a sense of urgency among those
who read it.

00:21:38.580 --> 00:21:43.500
Because we do live in this remarkable beautiful
age where we're all connected and we can come

00:21:43.500 --> 00:21:48.620
together today but we can also go and reach
tens of thousands of people all over the world

00:21:48.620 --> 00:21:51.490
based on shared ideals and shared values.

00:21:51.490 --> 00:21:58.830
And that I think is very unique because micro-entrepreneurship
in different ways has always existed, since

00:21:58.830 --> 00:22:00.559
the beginning of commerce.

00:22:00.559 --> 00:22:03.820
You know that's micro entrepreneurship is
not new.

00:22:03.820 --> 00:22:06.080
I used to live in Sierra Leone.

00:22:06.080 --> 00:22:10.530
And I would drive my Land Rover in the interior
of the country and go to the village and in

00:22:10.530 --> 00:22:13.799
West Africa almost everyone is an entrepreneur.

00:22:13.799 --> 00:22:17.970
Because everyone is buying and selling and
responsible for their own well-being and there

00:22:17.970 --> 00:22:20.450
is no formal economy for the most part.

00:22:20.450 --> 00:22:25.970
But the difference is in West Africa you can
pretty much only buy and sell in the village

00:22:25.970 --> 00:22:30.059
with your neighbors or with people in a very
small circle for the most part.

00:22:30.059 --> 00:22:34.160
But all of us have the chance to connect with
people all over the world based on those shared

00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:35.840
ideals or values or worldview.

00:22:35.840 --> 00:22:37.750
And I think that's very unique.

00:22:37.750 --> 00:22:41.450
And so I like something that Steve Jobs said
before his death.

00:22:41.450 --> 00:22:45.950
He said "Your time is limited so don't waste
it living someone else's life."

00:22:45.950 --> 00:22:52.070
And as I worked on the book and talked with
everyone whose stories are in the book I found

00:22:52.070 --> 00:22:55.750
that those stories were a testament to that
ideal.

00:22:55.750 --> 00:22:59.940
Testaments to the idea that we can do something
that we love, we can make the world a better

00:22:59.940 --> 00:23:01.799
place, we can earn a good income from it.

00:23:01.799 --> 00:23:06.230
But we can pursue things that are meaningful
most of the time.

00:23:06.230 --> 00:23:11.100
And I'm really grateful to be here at Google
today and thank you so much Rachel for arranging

00:23:11.100 --> 00:23:12.100
this.

00:23:12.100 --> 00:23:22.620
And thanks to all of you both here and elsewhere
for sharing the space with me, thanks.

00:23:22.620 --> 00:23:25.789
[Applause]
So should we do some questions?

00:23:25.789 --> 00:23:29.600
&gt;&gt;Rachel: I have a question.

00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:30.840
&gt;&gt;Chris: Yes Rachel.

00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:32.870
&gt;&gt;Rachel: You didn't plant me out here.

00:23:32.870 --> 00:23:33.870
&gt;&gt;Chris: I didn't.

00:23:33.870 --> 00:23:38.690
&gt;&gt;Rachel: So can you talk about, from your
pool of applicants and the survey people who

00:23:38.690 --> 00:23:46.009
either dropped out of college or high school,
what is the ratio there, did you find trends?

00:23:46.009 --> 00:23:47.450
&gt;&gt;Chris: Yeah great question.

00:23:47.450 --> 00:23:48.450
Yeah of course.

00:23:48.450 --> 00:23:53.929
So the question is people who dropped out
of college or high school versus those who

00:23:53.929 --> 00:23:58.019
stayed and were there trends in terms of the
people who are in the case study.

00:23:58.019 --> 00:23:59.399
I think it was quite varied.

00:23:59.399 --> 00:24:03.080
There were a lot of people who did have advanced
education.

00:24:03.080 --> 00:24:07.240
There were other people who had very little
higher education.

00:24:07.240 --> 00:24:08.840
So I'm not sure if there was a trend.

00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:14.950
I guess if there was a trend, it was a trend
towards independent learning of some form.

00:24:14.950 --> 00:24:18.000
A trend towards risk taking.

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:22.200
And again earlier I talked about risk and
kind of define that a bit differently because

00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:26.410
I don't necessarily think entrepreneurs are
risk takers or mavericks.

00:24:26.410 --> 00:24:31.140
But I would say that in a lot of the people
that we talked with there was a, more of a

00:24:31.140 --> 00:24:34.299
history of international travel for example.

00:24:34.299 --> 00:24:39.649
More of a history of living in more than one
place for example.

00:24:39.649 --> 00:24:42.210
Maybe just being exposed to different ideals.

00:24:42.210 --> 00:24:45.280
But within the education itself I would say
there were all kinds of people.

00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:49.809
There were high school dropout to PhD's who
left their field to do something else.

00:24:49.809 --> 00:24:55.519
&gt;&gt;Male number one: Along the same lines were
there any trends with regards to say people

00:24:55.519 --> 00:25:00.509
like the mattress story who did it out of
necessity versus the frequent-flier story

00:25:00.509 --> 00:25:04.789
where he was just sort of doing it as a side
hobby.

00:25:04.789 --> 00:25:06.640
&gt;&gt;Chris: Yeah great question.

00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:14.000
So was there a trend in terms of people making
this switch out of necessity, like the person

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:18.590
who was laid off versus the person who was
deliberate in staying in the job and establishing

00:25:18.590 --> 00:25:19.889
a side income?

00:25:19.889 --> 00:25:27.379
I would say it was more common for people
to make a transition out of a transition.

00:25:27.379 --> 00:25:31.851
And I would say it's more common for people
to be faced with a change or to have some

00:25:31.851 --> 00:25:35.080
kind of change imposed upon themselves and
then to make that change.

00:25:35.080 --> 00:25:36.690
And that's because you have to.

00:25:36.690 --> 00:25:38.470
You have this imperative.

00:25:38.470 --> 00:25:43.919
And so it creates a dramatic story and it's
interesting.

00:25:43.919 --> 00:25:48.070
But what I find in some ways is almost more
interesting is those people who don't have

00:25:48.070 --> 00:25:53.490
that imperative but then kind of take it upon
themselves to go and establish the side income.

00:25:53.490 --> 00:25:57.139
So we had both sides.

00:25:57.139 --> 00:26:04.100
I think the related question is sometimes,
for those people who are in a job and no plans

00:26:04.100 --> 00:26:07.889
to leave the job for awhile but they do want
to establish something on their own what do

00:26:07.889 --> 00:26:09.340
they do?

00:26:09.340 --> 00:26:14.860
And I tend to find a lot of those people kind
of remain in paralysis.

00:26:14.860 --> 00:26:17.700
Because everything's going okay.

00:26:17.700 --> 00:26:21.309
And so everything's going okay and they're
busy because we're all busy.

00:26:21.309 --> 00:26:27.490
And I do feel it's good for those who want
to create this side income or side project.

00:26:27.490 --> 00:26:32.740
I do feel that it's good to be more active
about that and to focus more on action than

00:26:32.740 --> 00:26:34.670
planning.

00:26:34.670 --> 00:26:39.259
Like almost no one in the study had a 60 page
business plan.

00:26:39.259 --> 00:26:42.240
Almost no one in the study borrowed money
from the bank.

00:26:42.240 --> 00:26:47.429
There was a couple of exceptions out of 1000
stories, but almost everyone just kind of

00:26:47.429 --> 00:26:50.870
bootstrapped and found a way to get to market
quickly.

00:26:50.870 --> 00:26:55.580
So regardless of the situation I would say
that the lesson is the same.

00:26:55.580 --> 00:26:57.539
Yes sir.

00:26:57.539 --> 00:27:01.555
&gt;&gt;Male #2: I had a question about choosing
the right idea.

00:27:01.555 --> 00:27:02.555
I think that, I'm just out of college last
year.

00:27:02.555 --> 00:27:07.460
And I think a lot of my fears in college and
even now about starting our own business is

00:27:07.460 --> 00:27:12.559
finding that idea that really resonates with
us as well as others.

00:27:12.559 --> 00:27:22.870
I think that there was a line that you used
that said that finding your passion that's

00:27:22.870 --> 00:27:28.790
doing something that no longer is a job, no
longer feels like a job.

00:27:28.790 --> 00:27:32.919
We also have the example with the mattress
salesman, that doesn't seem to be his passion.

00:27:32.919 --> 00:27:35.409
He wasn't like I'm gonna sell mattresses so,
&gt;&gt;Chris: Correct, correct

00:27:35.409 --> 00:27:36.875
&gt;&gt;Male #2: So where is that line about market
opportunities and about your passion?

00:27:36.875 --> 00:27:40.259
&gt;&gt;Chris: Where is that line about the market
opportunities and your passion?

00:27:40.259 --> 00:27:44.460
You said a few other things, but I'm just
gonna kinda go off that point.

00:27:44.460 --> 00:27:50.580
So the whole thing about following your passion,
there is a survey on a blog I read recently

00:27:50.580 --> 00:27:54.010
the question was what is the most overrated
phrase to see online?

00:27:54.010 --> 00:27:57.790
And follow your passion was like number one
or number two.

00:27:57.790 --> 00:28:02.970
It's really fascinating because there's like
two sides to this.

00:28:02.970 --> 00:28:08.380
Not everything that we are passionate about
is going to make a good business model.

00:28:08.380 --> 00:28:12.110
And in fact there's lots of things that we're
excited about, or passionate about that no

00:28:12.110 --> 00:28:14.999
one else is gonna care about enough to value.

00:28:14.999 --> 00:28:18.879
You know as I said in the book I used to be
very passionate about playing video games.

00:28:18.879 --> 00:28:21.629
And I was a really good Halo player.

00:28:21.629 --> 00:28:25.249
But no one came along and offered me a check
to do that right?

00:28:25.249 --> 00:28:29.499
I had to find a way to create value in my
business like everyone else.

00:28:29.499 --> 00:28:34.850
So not every passion can be monetized, however
I think when you look at successful people

00:28:34.850 --> 00:28:37.710
certainly everyone in the $100 startup model.

00:28:37.710 --> 00:28:44.309
But almost, I won't say everyone a lot of
successful entrepreneurs they have followed

00:28:44.309 --> 00:28:45.559
their passion right?

00:28:45.559 --> 00:28:47.490
They have done something that they're excited
about.

00:28:47.490 --> 00:28:52.379
But just as with those pursuing the smaller
model, they have found a way to make it useful

00:28:52.379 --> 00:28:55.070
and to connect with people and deliver something
that's valuable.

00:28:55.070 --> 00:28:59.730
So in terms of the mattress guy, no he wasn't
passionate about mattresses per se.

00:28:59.730 --> 00:29:04.350
I guess what he discovers that he was passionate
about community and he was passionate about

00:29:04.350 --> 00:29:07.350
small business and the role that his shop
could play in that.

00:29:07.350 --> 00:29:11.120
And doing the fun things like delivering the
mattresses on the bicycle, and just kind of

00:29:11.120 --> 00:29:12.749
making business fun.

00:29:12.749 --> 00:29:19.840
So in terms of ideas which you mentioned earlier,
one thing that's helpful if you're trying

00:29:19.840 --> 00:29:23.889
to figure out which skill do I have or which
passion do I have that could also be interesting

00:29:23.889 --> 00:29:25.169
to other people?

00:29:25.169 --> 00:29:29.769
So like the frequent-flier tickets as opposed
to playing Halo.

00:29:29.769 --> 00:29:33.789
One thing that's helpful is to focus on the
questions that people ask you.

00:29:33.789 --> 00:29:39.600
Because people probably ask you a certain
number of questions about specific topics

00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:40.730
frequently.

00:29:40.730 --> 00:29:44.409
And if you think about it, what is it that
people always ask me about?

00:29:44.409 --> 00:29:48.320
That is often a sign that you are perceived
authority in something.

00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:52.010
And also that that information is valued and
desirable.

00:29:52.010 --> 00:29:56.100
So with the frequent-flier guy, he discovered
his colleagues kept asking him how do you

00:29:56.100 --> 00:29:57.100
do this?

00:29:57.100 --> 00:29:58.350
And this whole thing is confusing to me.

00:29:58.350 --> 00:30:00.370
And when I call the airlines I don't get good
information.

00:30:00.370 --> 00:30:03.410
So he would explain that and go into it in
detail.

00:30:03.410 --> 00:30:06.779
And then finally he figured out that most
people don't actually want to do that themselves,

00:30:06.779 --> 00:30:07.919
they just want to have the outcome.

00:30:07.919 --> 00:30:09.999
So he was able to create a business out of
that.

00:30:09.999 --> 00:30:15.210
So I would go back to passions and skills
and then think about which of those are then

00:30:15.210 --> 00:30:17.419
useful or interesting to other people.

00:30:17.419 --> 00:30:21.019
And the same was true with Benny Lewis, the
language hacking guy.

00:30:21.019 --> 00:30:25.879
He was passionate about learning languages,
and he describes himself and in fact I mentioned

00:30:25.879 --> 00:30:28.840
it as a full-time language hacker.

00:30:28.840 --> 00:30:34.950
But essentially he's not being paid to learn
languages; he's being paid to help other people

00:30:34.950 --> 00:30:35.950
do that.

00:30:35.950 --> 00:30:37.799
So that's also a key distinction.

00:30:37.799 --> 00:30:41.220
And Rachel mentioned I'm on this quest to
visit every country in the world, every once

00:30:41.220 --> 00:30:45.269
in a while I read these blog posts that say
you know Chris Guillebeau is paid to travel.

00:30:45.269 --> 00:30:49.380
I'm not really paid to travel, like I'm glad
people like the blog and they might enjoy

00:30:49.380 --> 00:30:50.509
it, but no one pays me to travel.

00:30:50.509 --> 00:30:52.660
I have to create a specific business model.

00:30:52.660 --> 00:30:53.660
Thank you.

00:30:53.660 --> 00:30:54.660
Yes hi.

00:30:54.660 --> 00:30:55.679
&gt;&gt; Female #1: Hello.

00:30:55.679 --> 00:31:00.429
We're any of your case studies about entrepreneurs
who created nonprofits?

00:31:00.429 --> 00:31:07.770
And if so, what was that sort of process,
how does that differ from the other type?

00:31:07.770 --> 00:31:08.999
&gt;&gt;Chris: Yeah a very good question.

00:31:08.999 --> 00:31:11.740
Were any of the case studies about nonprofits?

00:31:11.740 --> 00:31:15.379
And if so how does that differ from other
kinds of businesses?

00:31:15.379 --> 00:31:22.499
So for the most part in this study I'm focusing
on for profit small businesses.

00:31:22.499 --> 00:31:27.120
Because again the whole goal is providing
freedom and independence for that entrepreneur

00:31:27.120 --> 00:31:28.120
or micro-entrepreneur.

00:31:28.120 --> 00:31:34.179
There are a lot of people who then created
that freedom for themselves and then used

00:31:34.179 --> 00:31:38.130
the time that they had or the resources that
they had to devote more to their nonprofit

00:31:38.130 --> 00:31:40.330
causes as well.

00:31:40.330 --> 00:31:45.120
But what I was interested in, probably more
than strictly nonprofits, I was interested

00:31:45.120 --> 00:31:49.659
in those who took a hybrid approach, which
we're seeing more and more.

00:31:49.659 --> 00:31:54.570
Like with Kiva for Toms Shoes or something
like that where it's like a for-profit company

00:31:54.570 --> 00:31:56.000
or organization with a cause.

00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:58.789
Or something this kind of merging the two
things.

00:31:58.789 --> 00:32:00.860
So there were a couple of stories about that.

00:32:00.860 --> 00:32:07.710
One of them was Selena and Khary Cuffe who
I believe they live in Los Angeles.

00:32:07.710 --> 00:32:11.600
And they had traveled a bit on the continent
of Africa.

00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:17.200
And in South Africa specifically, South Africa
is known for its wine industry and great wine.

00:32:17.200 --> 00:32:22.879
But due to all the effects of apartheid, most
of the vineyard owners were white South Africans.

00:32:22.879 --> 00:32:27.299
And there was a very small number of vineyards
that were owned by black South Africans.

00:32:27.299 --> 00:32:32.230
And so Selena and Khary started this business
called Heritage Link Brands that imported

00:32:32.230 --> 00:32:36.559
wine from South Africa from black-owned vineyards.

00:32:36.559 --> 00:32:38.820
And so they basically created a business around
this.

00:32:38.820 --> 00:32:41.289
I mean I think it's a low seven-figure business
now.

00:32:41.289 --> 00:32:46.110
They're importing wines to the US and I think
Canada and probably some other places too.

00:32:46.110 --> 00:32:49.779
So it's a business, but it's a business with
a deliberate social cause.

00:32:49.779 --> 00:32:54.860
And it's a business to uplift a population
that wasn't previously served well.

00:32:54.860 --> 00:32:56.820
So I was interested in the approaches of combining
both profit and nonprofit.

00:32:56.820 --> 00:32:57.820
Thank you.

00:32:57.820 --> 00:32:58.820
Yep
&gt;&gt;Male #3: Chris I have a group of friends

00:32:58.820 --> 00:32:59.820
that follow you very closely.

00:32:59.820 --> 00:33:00.820
Actually myself one of them as well.

00:33:00.820 --> 00:33:01.820
And we were chatting the other night after
having all read your book.

00:33:01.820 --> 00:33:02.820
And there was a topic that came up recently
that had to do with just the fear of having

00:33:02.820 --> 00:33:03.820
a great jobs, having that unconventional desire
to do something different than your jobs.

00:33:03.820 --> 00:33:04.820
He actually works for a large corporation
and felt that wasn't enough.

00:33:04.820 --> 00:33:05.820
Then went to like the rock stars start up,
and now he still is in that situation where

00:33:05.820 --> 00:33:06.820
it's not driving that freedom that he's looking
for.

00:33:06.820 --> 00:33:07.820
&gt;&gt;Chris: Right.

00:33:07.820 --> 00:33:14.820
&gt;&gt;Male #3: And he just coming up with these
reasons to what he wanted to do and how he

00:33:14.820 --> 00:33:17.460
wanted to do it.

00:33:17.460 --> 00:33:48.159
And the thing that was holding him back was,
what do I do if in a month or two I can pay

00:33:48.159 --> 00:33:49.159
my rent?

00:33:49.159 --> 00:33:50.850
Because I want to walk into one of them and
say I'm done, Then I want to be able to start

00:33:50.850 --> 00:33:51.850
my business and go for it.

00:33:51.850 --> 00:33:56.134
But that fear is something that constantly
holds us back, and I know that something you

00:33:56.134 --> 00:33:57.134
hear all the time.

00:33:57.134 --> 00:33:58.134
&gt;&gt;Chris: I do hear that all the time.

00:33:58.134 --> 00:34:01.450
And the question was about fear and if you
have a good job, but you have this desire

00:34:01.450 --> 00:34:04.610
for freedom what do you do and how do you
reconcile these things.

00:34:04.610 --> 00:34:09.080
And you have a good salary but you have this
desire to do something different.

00:34:09.080 --> 00:34:13.030
I do hear that all the time, I often hear
it from people who write in, especially from

00:34:13.030 --> 00:34:17.820
the large companies, Microsoft and other places,
never here of course.

00:34:17.820 --> 00:34:21.350
And it's phrased almost always exactly like
that.

00:34:21.350 --> 00:34:24.610
You know I have this desire to do something
but I have this.

00:34:24.610 --> 00:34:30.230
And sometimes it's from people who have families
or other real responsibilities and obligations.

00:34:30.230 --> 00:34:33.770
I think the wrong advice to tell those people
is quit your job now.

00:34:33.770 --> 00:34:35.920
You know quit your job, just go for it, it's
gonna be okay.

00:34:35.920 --> 00:34:38.080
I think that's the wrong advice.

00:34:38.080 --> 00:34:42.120
I would also say, I mentioned paralysis earlier.

00:34:42.120 --> 00:34:45.750
What often happens is that they get stuck
because they can only envision two alternatives.

00:34:45.750 --> 00:34:51.530
They can only envision staying in this job
which may have served me for a time and maybe

00:34:51.530 --> 00:34:54.070
its okay but I'm ready to do something different.

00:34:54.070 --> 00:34:58.750
And this general idea of freedom or working
for myself.

00:34:58.750 --> 00:35:03.060
But they don't really see how to get from
here to there and they don't imagine all the

00:35:03.060 --> 00:35:04.420
points in between.

00:35:04.420 --> 00:35:09.610
So I would say to that person why can't you
start now?

00:35:09.610 --> 00:35:10.760
While you have this job.

00:35:10.760 --> 00:35:14.310
And why can't you begin taking those steps
now.

00:35:14.310 --> 00:35:20.100
Because that fear is real, but there's nothing
to inhibit you from taking action now.

00:35:20.100 --> 00:35:22.950
And people often ask sometimes they say well
I got this really busy job and I'm working

00:35:22.950 --> 00:35:26.140
50 or 60 hours a week and I have no time.

00:35:26.140 --> 00:35:30.300
Well a couple of things, one we all make time
for what's important to us.

00:35:30.300 --> 00:35:33.810
So if this is important to you then you can
make some time.

00:35:33.810 --> 00:35:39.190
I also think it's an advantage when you have
limited time to pursue your micro startup

00:35:39.190 --> 00:35:42.180
because then you can only do things that matter.

00:35:42.180 --> 00:35:45.190
And if you have 40 hours a week to work on
it, you can probably think of all kind of

00:35:45.190 --> 00:35:47.800
things that are irrelevant to the business
model.

00:35:47.800 --> 00:35:50.880
But a business essentially is just three things.

00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:56.400
It's a product or a service, a group of people
willing to pay for it, and a means of getting

00:35:56.400 --> 00:35:57.400
paid.

00:35:57.400 --> 00:36:02.180
So if you focus on those three things and
go from a general offer, general business

00:36:02.180 --> 00:36:05.540
idea to a specific offer as soon as possible.

00:36:05.540 --> 00:36:11.910
There's a one-page consulting guide in the
book, how to get your website up, how to one-page

00:36:11.910 --> 00:36:14.580
promotion plan, what to do every day to get
the word out.

00:36:14.580 --> 00:36:20.180
If you just start that now, I feel that that
is so much healthier, and I feel like it generates

00:36:20.180 --> 00:36:21.300
more security.

00:36:21.300 --> 00:36:25.560
And if you had something that's making even
a thousand dollars a month or something then

00:36:25.560 --> 00:36:29.310
I know that's not a lot of money but it's
much easier usually to grow a business that's

00:36:29.310 --> 00:36:32.140
making some amount of money than it is to
start it from the beginning.

00:36:32.140 --> 00:36:35.600
So I feel like one of the ways of dealing
with that fear is to start now and to have

00:36:35.600 --> 00:36:38.800
something so then maybe you don't have the
hundred thousand dollar a year side income

00:36:38.800 --> 00:36:40.550
like the frequent-flier type.

00:36:40.550 --> 00:36:44.760
But if you have something that so much more
easier to envision, the possibilities as opposed

00:36:44.760 --> 00:36:49.180
to just saying yeah go for it, let me quit
my job at the greatest company in the world

00:36:49.180 --> 00:36:54.040
or something to go and do something that's
kind of uncertain.

00:36:54.040 --> 00:37:00.350
And some people do that, but maybe it's easier
to do both for a while.

00:37:00.350 --> 00:37:01.680
That's great anything else, are we good?

00:37:01.680 --> 00:37:02.680
&gt;&gt;Male #3: I was gonna asked if you could
briefly touch on how you went from your first

00:37:02.680 --> 00:37:03.680
book to the idea for this book.

00:37:03.680 --> 00:37:11.960
It sounds like much of the messaging is the
same.

00:37:11.960 --> 00:37:12.960
I haven't read this one yet.

00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:17.930
But I was wondering how you sorta went from
that one to one that was more focused on taking

00:37:17.930 --> 00:37:19.740
action and creating a side business.

00:37:19.740 --> 00:37:23.760
&gt;&gt;Chris: OK, so how did I go from book number
one which was "The Art of Nonconformity",

00:37:23.760 --> 00:37:25.410
to book number two "The $100 Startup?"

00:37:25.410 --> 00:37:27.700
What was the process?

00:37:27.700 --> 00:37:29.190
So they're actually quite different.

00:37:29.190 --> 00:37:33.940
The first book was much more general, much
more about world view.

00:37:33.940 --> 00:37:36.630
A lot of stories of like challenging authority.

00:37:36.630 --> 00:37:40.810
Some more information about travel which this
book doesn't really touch on.

00:37:40.810 --> 00:37:45.970
So "The $100 Startup," is much more specifically
focused on this idea of establishing freedom

00:37:45.970 --> 00:37:47.110
through a micro business.

00:37:47.110 --> 00:37:52.490
And it's also based on, I guess I would also
say it's based a lot more on data and on the

00:37:52.490 --> 00:37:53.490
study.

00:37:53.490 --> 00:37:56.640
That came about in part from the first book
tour.

00:37:56.640 --> 00:38:01.070
I went to every state and every province in
Canada and along the way I just met a lot

00:38:01.070 --> 00:38:04.390
of people who fit this unexpected entrepreneur
model.

00:38:04.390 --> 00:38:07.650
And I heard a lot of stories, and I started
getting more e-mail.

00:38:07.650 --> 00:38:11.120
And so that's when I thought we need to tell
the story well.

00:38:11.120 --> 00:38:16.190
So my main goal in writing the book was to
tell these stories well hopefully.

00:38:16.190 --> 00:38:20.370
To do honor to them and then to provide that
narrative or that blueprint that other people

00:38:20.370 --> 00:38:21.370
could follow.

00:38:21.370 --> 00:38:25.700
So it came about mostly organically, just
as I traveled and I heard from different people

00:38:25.700 --> 00:38:26.780
that I'm connected with.

00:38:26.780 --> 00:38:27.780
Great.

00:38:27.780 --> 00:38:28.780
&gt;&gt;Rachel: anybody else?

00:38:28.780 --> 00:38:29.780
&gt;&gt;Male #3: Can you do one last question?

00:38:29.780 --> 00:38:30.780
&gt;&gt;Chris: Sure.

00:38:30.780 --> 00:38:43.800
&gt;&gt;Male #3: I haven't read the book yet, but
a lot of the stories you mentioned were very

00:38:43.800 --> 00:38:45.010
individual.

00:38:45.010 --> 00:38:54.170
And this person had an idea or has a situation.

00:38:54.170 --> 00:38:59.960
What about in other industries that require
more cooperation.

00:38:59.960 --> 00:39:06.380
[Inaudible] Do you have any examples of partnerships
in general?

00:39:06.380 --> 00:39:12.350
&gt;&gt;Chris: Great so most of the stories that
we've touched on are fairly individual and

00:39:12.350 --> 00:39:14.920
wondering about partnerships.

00:39:14.920 --> 00:39:18.280
And opportunities to leverage knowledge and
connectivity.

00:39:18.280 --> 00:39:19.280
That's a great question.

00:39:19.280 --> 00:39:26.130
I would say I probably have my own individual
bias towards solo entrepreneurs and those

00:39:26.130 --> 00:39:28.920
people who just kind of establish things on
their own.

00:39:28.920 --> 00:39:30.690
One because that's what I know.

00:39:30.690 --> 00:39:34.431
I don't know the big startup model, I don't
know that traditional business model that

00:39:34.431 --> 00:39:36.080
we talked about in the beginning.

00:39:36.080 --> 00:39:40.440
I just know my own history of always being
self-employed, of always kind of hustling

00:39:40.440 --> 00:39:42.940
to make my own way.

00:39:42.940 --> 00:39:44.860
And so that's the world in which I'm most
comfortable with.

00:39:44.860 --> 00:39:48.310
And those of the stories that I'm probably
best at telling and analyzing.

00:39:48.310 --> 00:39:56.330
I would say though that everyone that we looked
at in the book, we also had a number of partnerships.

00:39:56.330 --> 00:40:00.590
Lots of husbands and wives or couples operating
their business together or two business partners

00:40:00.590 --> 00:40:01.690
operating it together.

00:40:01.690 --> 00:40:09.660
But I really wasn't looking at like a model
of 10 people or more than that building an

00:40:09.660 --> 00:40:11.120
actual company.

00:40:11.120 --> 00:40:15.600
So in terms of the partnerships, there's some
information about partnerships, about how

00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:16.870
that works and how it doesn't.

00:40:16.870 --> 00:40:21.880
About using the strength of one person to
remedy the weaknesses of the other.

00:40:21.880 --> 00:40:25.910
But for the most part I guess I'm much more
interested in that individual focus of freedom.

00:40:25.910 --> 00:40:27.290
Just because that's what I know.

00:40:27.290 --> 00:40:32.100
All right, thanks again guys thank you.

00:40:32.100 --> 00:40:37.060
[Applause]
&gt;&gt;Rachel: Thanks Chris.

00:40:37.060 --> 00:40:37.619
&gt;&gt;Chris: Thank You.
