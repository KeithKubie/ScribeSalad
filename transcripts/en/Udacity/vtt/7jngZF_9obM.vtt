00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.960
So now let's try a little more challenging example.

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:06.330
It's not really challenging, but it's a bit more difficult than the first one.

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.390
So this is a 3-line code and then I want you to tell me the number of time steps

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:15.060
that this code will need on the run.

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:19.220
For this, I should mention that we're going to count this operation here--the while

00:00:19.220 --> 99:59:59.000
and the comparison of s if it's greater than 0 as a simple operation.
