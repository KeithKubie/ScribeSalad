we're going to go into agonizing detail

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:17.539
we're going to go into agonizing detail
 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:23.330
we're going to go into agonizing detail
about what DNA viruses do to elaborate

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340
about what DNA viruses do to elaborate
 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.279
about what DNA viruses do to elaborate
the genetic information that's contained

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289
the genetic information that's contained
 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.679
the genetic information that's contained
in their genomes and by that I mean in

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689
in their genomes and by that I mean in
 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.189
in their genomes and by that I mean in
particular how do they transcribe RNA

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199
particular how do they transcribe RNA
 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.810
particular how do they transcribe RNA
from their DNA genomes and there are a

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820
from their DNA genomes and there are a
 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.440
from their DNA genomes and there are a
couple of points that are important and

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:38.450
couple of points that are important and
 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:41.270
couple of points that are important and
they start with what if viruses taught

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280
they start with what if viruses taught
 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.299
they start with what if viruses taught
us as with everything that dr. a Canelo

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309
us as with everything that dr. a Canelo
 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.459
us as with everything that dr. a Canelo
has told you viruses of course teach us

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469
has told you viruses of course teach us
 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.700
has told you viruses of course teach us
everything well they teach us a lot but

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710
everything well they teach us a lot but
 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.799
everything well they teach us a lot but
they've yielded some very fundamental

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809
they've yielded some very fundamental
 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.080
they've yielded some very fundamental
information about control signals and

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090
information about control signals and
 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:59.000
information about control signals and
that is how various promoters are used

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010
that is how various promoters are used
 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.540
that is how various promoters are used
to initiate transcription and they've

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550
to initiate transcription and they've
 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.939
to initiate transcription and they've
told us informed us about what

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949
told us informed us about what
 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.670
told us informed us about what
constitutes a promoter that is what are

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680
constitutes a promoter that is what are
 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.310
constitutes a promoter that is what are
the DNA sequences that are recognized by

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320
the DNA sequences that are recognized by
 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.080

are very important in separating virus
 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.070
are very important in separating virus
from host promoters they've told us

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080
from host promoters they've told us
 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.380
from host promoters they've told us
about what an enhancer is and we'll get

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390
about what an enhancer is and we'll get
 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:31.789
about what an enhancer is and we'll get
into a little more detail about that

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799
into a little more detail about that
 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.679
into a little more detail about that
later but an enhancer is a magic

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689
later but an enhancer is a magic
 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.929
later but an enhancer is a magic
sequence it's something that does just

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939
sequence it's something that does just
 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:39.039
sequence it's something that does just
that it raises the initiation rate of

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:39.049
that it raises the initiation rate of
 

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:42.620
that it raises the initiation rate of
transcription and results in more RNA

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630
transcription and results in more RNA
 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.510
transcription and results in more RNA
being transcribed and there are some

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520
being transcribed and there are some
 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.399
being transcribed and there are some
very interesting properties of enhancers

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409
very interesting properties of enhancers
 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:49.039
very interesting properties of enhancers
they've also told us about introns and

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049
they've also told us about introns and
 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:53.179
they've also told us about introns and
exons and why nascent RNA transcripts

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189
exons and why nascent RNA transcripts
 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.609
exons and why nascent RNA transcripts
are bigger than messenger rnas and we'll

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619
are bigger than messenger rnas and we'll
 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.770
are bigger than messenger rnas and we'll
talk a lot about transcripts and we'll

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780
talk a lot about transcripts and we'll
 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.139
talk a lot about transcripts and we'll
talk about messenger RNAs and it's very

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149
talk about messenger RNAs and it's very
 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:01.910
talk about messenger RNAs and it's very
important to me that you understand what

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920
important to me that you understand what
 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.740
important to me that you understand what
the difference between those two is so I

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750
the difference between those two is so I
 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.260
the difference between those two is so I
will hammer that into your heads until

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270
will hammer that into your heads until
 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.359
will hammer that into your heads until
we're all sick of it and then finally

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369
we're all sick of it and then finally
 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.699
we're all sick of it and then finally
and perhaps most interestingly they've

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709
and perhaps most interestingly they've
 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.280
and perhaps most interestingly they've
told us how RNA synthesis is initiated

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290
told us how RNA synthesis is initiated
 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.500
told us how RNA synthesis is initiated
and regulated and they're very very

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510
and regulated and they're very very
 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.830

that so why is transcription important

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340
that so why is transcription important
 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.280

it's usually one of the first events

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290
it's usually one of the first events
 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.649
it's usually one of the first events
that follows infection and it's like

00:02:39.649 --> 00:02:39.659
that follows infection and it's like
 

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:43.250
that follows infection and it's like
that because viruses tend not to carry

hosts in most cases are recognized by

00:21:36.090 --> 00:21:36.100
hosts in most cases are recognized by
 

00:21:36.100 --> 00:21:38.950
hosts in most cases are recognized by
cell RNA polymerase and that leads to

00:21:38.950 --> 00:21:38.960
cell RNA polymerase and that leads to
 

00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:41.230
cell RNA polymerase and that leads to
either early or immediate early gene

00:21:41.230 --> 00:21:41.240
either early or immediate early gene
 

00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:45.730
either early or immediate early gene
expression and those are the proteins

00:21:45.730 --> 00:21:45.740

again that either enhance gene

00:21:49.149 --> 00:21:49.159

for late transcription this template has

00:21:58.360 --> 00:21:58.370
for late transcription this template has
 

00:21:58.370 --> 00:22:00.940
for late transcription this template has
to produce a structure that's

00:22:00.940 --> 00:22:00.950
to produce a structure that's
 

00:22:00.950 --> 00:22:03.669
to produce a structure that's
recognizable by the transcription

00:22:03.669 --> 00:22:03.679
recognizable by the transcription
 

00:22:03.679 --> 00:22:06.460

apparatus of the host and that's to

00:22:06.460 --> 00:22:06.470
apparatus of the host and that's to
 

00:22:06.470 --> 00:22:09.100

a virus you want to make hundreds
 

00:22:19.620 --> 00:22:21.890
a virus you want to make hundreds
because you want to make more virus but

00:22:21.890 --> 00:22:21.900
because you want to make more virus but
 

00:22:21.900 --> 00:22:23.840
because you want to make more virus but
in order to make more virus you have to

00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:23.850
in order to make more virus you have to
 

00:22:23.850 --> 00:22:26.090
in order to make more virus you have to
make more messenger RNA and a lot more

00:22:26.090 --> 00:22:26.100
make more messenger RNA and a lot more
 

00:22:26.100 --> 00:22:28.640
make more messenger RNA and a lot more

00:33:43.060 --> 00:33:43.070
and what's important for me to tell you
 

00:33:43.070 --> 00:33:45.670
and what's important for me to tell you
about is that there is one transcription

00:33:45.670 --> 00:33:45.680
about is that there is one transcription
 

00:33:45.680 --> 00:33:48.660
about is that there is one transcription

DNA synthesis called ena that is

00:33:52.630 --> 00:33:52.640
DNA synthesis called ena that is
 

00:33:52.640 --> 00:33:55.420
DNA synthesis called ena that is
recognized by host proteins and host

00:33:55.420 --> 00:33:55.430
recognized by host proteins and host
 

00:33:55.430 --> 00:33:57.910
recognized by host proteins and host
proteins alone and it contains an

transcribed from adenovirus DNA and it

00:34:04.870 --> 00:34:04.880
transcribed from adenovirus DNA and it
 

00:34:04.880 --> 00:34:06.760
transcribed from adenovirus DNA and it
is absolutely essential because what it

00:34:06.760 --> 00:34:06.770
is absolutely essential because what it
 

00:34:06.770 --> 00:34:10.300
is absolutely essential because what it
does is it activates transcription of e

00:34:10.300 --> 00:34:10.310
does is it activates transcription of e
 

00:34:10.310 --> 00:34:14.230
does is it activates transcription of e
to an early gene product so this is an

00:34:14.230 --> 00:34:14.240
to an early gene product so this is an
 

00:34:14.240 --> 00:34:16.540
to an early gene product so this is an
immediate early gene product in E 2 and

00:34:16.540 --> 00:34:16.550
immediate early gene product in E 2 and
 

00:34:16.550 --> 00:34:20.440
immediate early gene product in E 2 and
E 2 begins to start the DNA replication

00:34:20.440 --> 00:34:20.450
E 2 begins to start the DNA replication
 

00:34:20.450 --> 00:34:24.220
E 2 begins to start the DNA replication
cycle and that allows for the synthesis

00:34:24.220 --> 00:34:24.230
cycle and that allows for the synthesis
 

00:34:24.230 --> 00:34:29.530
cycle and that allows for the synthesis
of late RNAs so why is why is this

00:34:29.530 --> 00:34:29.540
of late RNAs so why is why is this
 

00:34:29.540 --> 00:34:31.750

and they like to do that and they like

01:10:24.859 --> 01:10:24.869
and they like to do that and they like
 

01:10:24.869 --> 01:10:26.300
and they like to do that and they like
to do it because they want to get things

01:10:26.300 --> 01:10:26.310
to do it because they want to get things
 

01:10:26.310 --> 01:10:26.959

control is it at many levels not just

01:10:29.750 --> 01:10:29.760
control is it at many levels not just
 

01:10:29.760 --> 01:10:32.330
control is it at many levels not just
that starting the first family of

01:10:32.330 --> 01:10:32.340

transcription units but the later
 

01:10:34.080 --> 01:10:36.160
transcription units but the later
families and sometimes they depend upon

01:10:36.160 --> 01:10:36.170
families and sometimes they depend upon
 

01:10:36.170 --> 01:10:39.379
families and sometimes they depend upon
expression of gene products and or DNA

01:10:39.379 --> 01:10:39.389
expression of gene products and or DNA
 

01:10:39.389 --> 01:10:43.010
expression of gene products and or DNA
replication there are always host

01:10:43.010 --> 01:10:43.020
replication there are always host
 

01:10:43.020 --> 01:10:43.550
replication there are always host

that are involved and they help regulate

01:10:45.530 --> 01:10:45.540
that are involved and they help regulate
 

01:10:45.540 --> 01:10:47.870
that are involved and they help regulate
transcription and in almost every case

01:10:47.870 --> 01:10:47.880
transcription and in almost every case
 

01:10:47.880 --> 01:10:50.300
transcription and in almost every case
that we know about virus gene expression

01:10:50.300 --> 01:10:50.310
that we know about virus gene expression
 

01:10:50.310 --> 01:10:52.940
that we know about virus gene expression
is coordinate regulated in the temporal

01:10:52.940 --> 01:10:52.950
is coordinate regulated in the temporal
 

01:10:52.950 --> 01:10:56.360
is coordinate regulated in the temporal
manner thank you
