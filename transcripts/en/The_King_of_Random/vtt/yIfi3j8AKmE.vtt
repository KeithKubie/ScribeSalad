[Captions by Y Translator]
YouTuber Mark Rober
has a cool video

00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:05.900
where he makes a giant
fluid sand bed out of a hot tub.

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:07.100
In the beginning of that video,

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:09.692
he also shows his small
prototype sand bed

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:12.700
and we're going to be showing you
step-by-step how you can build one

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:13.880
of those for yourself.

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:20.460
[Music]

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.000
If you are the kind of person
who likes watching cool builds,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.300
and engineering on YouTube,

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.000
then you probably know
who Mark Rober is,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.200
and you've probably seen
his video where he took a hot tub,

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.100
filled it with sand,
ran air through it,

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:33.800
and made just a fluid sand bed
that you could lie down inside.

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.120
It was very cool.

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.100
But he started out the video showing
a smaller version that he built

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.180
as a proof of concept.

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.100
I reached out to Mark,
and he said it would be cool

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.900
if I did a video showing
you step-by-step how to build one

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:46.100
of those smaller fluid
sand beds for yourself.

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.100
Here's the basic plan,
we're going to set up a series of tubes

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.980
and corners that fit inside a box,
and pressurized with air.

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.500
The piping will be full
of very small holes that run air

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.500
into the sand turning it into a fluid.

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.160
Here are the parts that we
are going to need to build this.

00:01:00.182 --> 00:01:03.100
We have our 1/2 inch pipe,
right here, we have about,

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:04.000
15 feet of it.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:04.900
We won't use all of that

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:06.100
but it's a good amount
to start with.

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:09.100
We have four,
1/2 inch elbow pieces.

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.500
We have eight,
1/2 inch T pieces

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.980
that are smooth in all three ports.

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:16.000
And we have one,
1/2 inch T piece

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.300
that's threaded in the center port
and just a push fit on the sides.

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.900
We've got a little bit
of metal hardware as well.

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:26.780
This is a bushing that goes
from 1/2 inch to 1/4 inch

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:27.500
on the inside.

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:30.840
A connector that's 1/4
inch on both sides.

00:01:31.072 --> 00:01:35.300
A small 1/4 inch ball valve
and a 1/4 inch fitting that attaches

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:36.200
to our air compressor.

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:40.892
We also have this plastic tub that I
bought at Home Depot for about 6 bucks.

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.400
This size tub ends up
working out really well,

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:48.600
and the bottom inside measurements
are about 18 1/2 by 12 inches,

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:53.980
and that would be 47 centimeters
by 30 and 1/2 centimeters.

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:56.600
Now, we need to cut several pieces
out of our 1/2 inch pipe.

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:00.800
First, we need five pieces that
are 16 and 1/4 inches long.

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.600
If you want to get really precise,

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.252
that's about 41 and 1/4 centimeters.

00:02:06.012 --> 00:02:08.000
You don't have to use one
of these pipe cutters for this

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.702
but it really is nice.

00:02:10.512 --> 00:02:11.600
With those five pieces cut,

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:17.452
the next two pieces are two that are
7 inches long just under 18 centimeters.

00:02:20.332 --> 00:02:24.220
Finally, we want 10 pieces
that are 1/3 quarters of an inch long,

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.192
which is about 4 and 1/2 centimeters.

00:02:26.612 --> 00:02:29.640
While he was coming up with the design,
Mark did a lot of trial and error,

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.000
and he found that the way
to get the best air flow

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.200
through the pipes was

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.400
that each of these long pieces,
which will be going across our box

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.000
will have a series
of small holes running

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.180
along the bottom.

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:44.200
There will be pairs of holes
at 90-degree angles apart

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.320
from each other and spaced out
about every 2 and 1/2 centimeters

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:48.500
all the way down the pipe.

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.620
To get the lines of where
I'm going to drill the holes,

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.700
I've marched two spots on the end
of the pipe that are about

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.740
90 degrees apart from each other

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:59.221
and I'm now going to line
these up just on the table,

00:02:59.221 --> 00:03:01.740
and trace a line down the whole pipe.

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:05.000
We've got our lines drawn our pipes
and now we need to mark out the spacing

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.700
for where we'll drill all of the holes.

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:08.752
Every 2 and 1/2 centimeters is the goal.

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.680
We've got 80 marks on the pipes,

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:14.100
and we need to drill
each of them on both sides.

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:17.520
So that is 160 holes that we need
to drill into these pipes.

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:18.900
For that, we are going
to be using a drill press

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.100
and a 1 millimeter drill bit.

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:23.100
It's very small drill bit
and it helps prevent any

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:25.982
of the sand getting up through the hole
and ending up inside the piping.

00:03:25.982 --> 00:03:32.860
[Music]

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.300
Alright, we've got
all five pipes drilled out.

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:37.800
If we block one end
and blow on the other side,

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:40.912
we can feel all of those holes
just pumping air out.

00:03:43.442 --> 00:03:44.900
Now we have those,
and it's time to start

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:46.660
connecting all of our pipes together.

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:49.140
I'm going to put together all of one side,

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:51.040
and then all of the other side,

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:53.962
and then I'll go about gluing
all of the pieces in between.

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:57.400
Making stuff out of PVC.

00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:59.240
Guys, my album
drops next month.

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:00.500
It's gonna be so good.

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.480
Now, this side can be a little bit tricky

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:06.492
because we kind of need to push
all of them on at the same time.

00:04:07.572 --> 00:04:09.172
But, I think we
can make it work.

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:17.280
[Music]

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:20.500
So now we've got this lattice
with hundreds of holes

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:23.460
along the bottom that
will be spraying our air out.

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:25.600
There is another modification
I do want to make.

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:28.840
We're going to take that same drill bit
and add a few more holes

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:30.880
through all of the supporting structure

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:33.200
so that all of the air
gets blown all the way

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:34.400
to the sides of the container,

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:35.940
and we don't just have it in the middle.

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:40.380
Our air is going to enter into
this through these two T pieces,

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:42.880
and you can see that this
mostly fits down in there,

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:45.780
but it's just a little bit too wide,
and that's intentional

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:48.160
because we're going to drill
two holes in the bottom,

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:49.700
and fit it in through those holes.

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:56.340
This 1 and 1/8 inch spade bit
we're using is just barely larger

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:58.400
than the pipes we're trying
to fit through the hole

00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:59.500
so it should be pretty snug

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:01.480
if it cuts a nice clean hole.

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:03.700
We are cutting on
to sort of a curved edge.

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:07.212
So there's a very real possibility
that it won't be perfectly smooth.

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:11.460
[Music]

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:12.700
Alright that fits.

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:14.600
It's pretty snug,
holds itself into place.

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:17.580
There is some gap around that,
we'll fill and plug that up.

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:19.040
That's working.

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:23.180
[Music]

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:26.200
Takes a little bit
of effort squishing it down

00:05:26.252 --> 00:05:27.100
forcing it into place.

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:30.600
But, once we get it down
in there, it fits quite snug.

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:33.000
You can see it's just right up
against all of the edges of the tub,

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.800
which is just what we want.

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:38.400
A little bit of space down below
that'll help the airflow up

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:39.000
through it better.

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:41.700
Now, let's take
some silicone caulking.

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:44.400
Mix it with a little bit of water,
and then just press that

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:45.700
around these seals.

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:47.600
It will basically be
Proto Putty although,

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:49.080
we won't add the cornstarch,

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:51.200
and it should just keep
a nice tight seal around there.

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:53.800
There's not going to be
pressure pushing out on these

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:55.700
so it doesn't have to be
a high pressure seal.

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:58.852
That's just to keep any of the sand
from running out those holes

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:00.280
while it's nice and fluid.

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:02.100
With our box glued in place,

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:04.620
it's now time to add
the rest of the hardware.

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:09.180
We're going to use our other two
small pieces to connect two more elbows.

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:11.940
Those elbows will connect
to our seven inch pieces,

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:14.700
and that will connect to
our T with the threaded spot,

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:17.360
our T with the threaded spot
will have the bushing,

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:19.800
the connector, the quarter inch ball valve,

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:22.122
and finally the piece that connects
to the air compressor.

00:06:23.982 --> 00:06:25.300
Now, we're going to turn
the compressor on,

00:06:25.312 --> 00:06:26.820
and while that's charging up,

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:28.600
we're going to load
in the first type of sand.

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:31.500
We've got four different types
of sand that we're going to try out

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:34.780
to see which one's work well with this
and see which ones don't.

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:38.680
First up is play sand.

00:06:39.322 --> 00:06:41.200
This is just your normal
playground stuff.

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:45.300
It's not super consistent,
there's a lot of size variation with it.

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:47.900
All we have to do to add
pressure is open the valve

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:50.500
and we actually have control
if we just open it a little bit.

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:52.500
We only have a little bit
of are getting through.

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:55.252
If we open it a lot,
a lot pours through.

00:06:55.260 --> 00:07:09.040
[Music]

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:11.440
Weird how little it works
in the middle, though.

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:16.080
That's not putting up
much at all right there.

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:23.040
[Music]

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:25.600
So the playground sand
works a little bit.

00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:28.400
It's very very dense
while it's just sitting in there

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:29.700
without any air flowing through it.

00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:31.812
You can't really pass your hand
through it very easily,

00:07:31.812 --> 00:07:33.982
unless you're just
like digging down in.

00:07:34.542 --> 00:07:36.500
So, playground sand is not so good,

00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:41.200
it's very uneven and even the finest
grains of the sand aren't that fine

00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:42.600
compared to some other types.

00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:44.960
So playground sand,
I don't know,

00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:48.900
I'd give this like a C-grade,
really not that great.

00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:50.500
Let's move on to the next kind.

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:53.500
Next up, we have
this Quartz mineral filler,

00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:57.520
and this is usually designed for just
mixing into cement to make concrete.

00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:00.500
It's a fairly coarse grain,
so, I have my doubts

00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:01.800
that this stuff is going
to work very well,

00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:03.422
but I haven't actually tried this kind.

00:08:04.252 --> 00:08:04.842
Here goes.

00:08:04.842 --> 00:08:10.560
[Music]

00:08:10.660 --> 00:08:12.920
All the way open and nothing.

00:08:14.342 --> 00:08:16.112
Now, we'll fill it
back up into the bag.

00:08:17.432 --> 00:08:20.300
So now we have what
isn't actually sand.

00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:23.000
This is actually
a glass bead material.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.100
It's used for sandblasting.

00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:27.480
Mark in his video
used glass bead too.

00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:32.400
I don't know if we're using the exact same
grain, but it is a very small, very fine,

00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:35.500
and fairly uniform grain,
which is really what you want

00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:36.540
for one of these beds.

00:08:36.540 --> 00:08:40.120
[Music]

00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:42.960
That was a lot of bubbling
and I barely had this open.

00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:46.400
Whoo!

00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:49.200
That is crazy already.

00:08:50.482 --> 00:08:53.700
So, even when it's closed,
this stuff is fine grain enough

00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:57.700
that I can move it,
and kind of swirl it pretty easily,

00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:00.492
but it does stop my hand.

00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:03.900
Doesn't go anywhere
and opening just a little bit.

00:09:05.380 --> 00:09:08.002
I can now just push my hand
right down through that.

00:09:09.140 --> 00:09:11.380
Let's open it more,
to really get it bubbling.

00:09:11.380 --> 00:09:15.380
[Music]

00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:18.100
Look at that, it's just got
like waves back and forth.

00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:23.220
[Music]

00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:24.220
Beautiful.

00:09:24.572 --> 00:09:27.200
This is a cool way
of illustrating a concept

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:29.100
that when you're in a boat,
and you're in the ocean,

00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:30.700
if you ever see water that's bubbling,

00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:32.000
you're supposed to avoid it.

00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:35.000
A boat floats on the water
because the boat plus the air

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.400
in it has a lower average density
than the water underneath it.

00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:42.500
However, water with are bubbling up
through it has a lower average density

00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:43.400
than regular water,

00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:44.740
and you can hit a critical point,

00:09:44.740 --> 00:09:46.600
where your boat,
even with nothing wrong with it,

00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:49.300
can just sink right down
into the water air mixture.

00:09:49.820 --> 00:09:53.080
If you think of this sand
as water and the air as air,

00:09:53.340 --> 00:09:55.140
you can get something similar happening.

00:09:55.140 --> 00:09:58.500
These pieces of plastic,
they float on top of the sand.

00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:02.600
However, once there's air floating
through the density of the sand goes down

00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:04.460
and these pieces of plastic,

00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:07.360
they don't survive very well.

00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:14.660
[Music]

00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:16.280
And your ship has sunk.

00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:24.620
[Music]

00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:27.860
"Random fact, it's been estimated
that there are approximately

00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:31.292
seven quintillion,
five hundred quadrillion grains

00:10:31.292 --> 00:10:33.200
of sand on all the beaches in the world.

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:37.040
That's a "75"
with 17 zeros after it."

00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:52.680
[Music]

00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:53.300
Alright.

00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:54.972
Let's see if our
colored sand works.

00:10:54.980 --> 00:10:57.760
[Music]

00:10:57.860 --> 00:10:59.380
Yeah.

00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:01.100
I'm just gonna turn
it off again.

00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:04.380
That's already starting
to mix so much.

00:11:04.992 --> 00:11:05.700
Alright, I'm going
to turn it on.

00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:06.500
It's going to get fluid

00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:07.700
and I'm just going to put
my hand through it.

00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:10.160
And it's just going
to get mixed up fast.

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:28.700
[Music]

00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:30.600
The fluid sand bed is
not that hard to build.

00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:32.700
It doesn't take that long
and it doesn't cost that much.

00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:34.659
I think, by far,
your biggest expense

00:11:34.659 --> 00:11:37.000
is going to be if you want
to get the really good sand.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.420
That's the superfine glass beads
that are used for sandblasting.

00:11:40.420 --> 00:11:43.220
That bag did cost me 30-35 bucks,

00:11:43.220 --> 00:11:45.260
but it works by far the best.

00:11:45.402 --> 00:11:47.900
But thank you again
to Mark Rober for his design,

00:11:47.900 --> 00:11:48.700
and saying it's cool

00:11:48.700 --> 00:11:51.300
if we make a video showing
how to build the small one.

00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:55.500
If you guys have not seen his video
where he turns a hot tub

00:11:55.500 --> 00:11:57.200
into one of these things,
you got to check it out.

00:11:57.200 --> 00:11:59.300
He's like floating in it,
and there's like six people

00:11:59.380 --> 00:12:02.080
in it at once, it is super cool.

00:12:02.100 --> 00:12:05.800
I also thought it was super funny
watching the up-close slow-mo

00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:07.800
of the sandy erupting
into being a fluid.

00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:09.800
It really looks kind of
like a landscape that

00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:13.300
you're seeing from a drone shot above
but we just took a camera and like

00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:15.220
put it down in the sand practically.

00:12:15.220 --> 00:12:16.300
It looks really fun.

00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:18.340
But it just starts
moving a little bit.

00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:21.400
The sand is really light reflective
so you can see like little points

00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:22.300
of light starting to appear

00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:23.680
and then the whole landscape just starts...

00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:27.400
just like that.

00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:29.300
I hope to see some of you build this.

00:12:29.300 --> 00:12:31.800

like to post the photos

00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:34.262
and we'll check it out.

00:12:35.042 --> 00:12:36.500
Guys, the fun
does not end here.

00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:37.480
There's more for you to see.

00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:38.700
That box up at the top,
will take you directly

00:12:38.700 --> 00:12:40.600
to our last video
and you should check that one out.

00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:43.300
The other box shows you what YouTube
thinks you should be watching next,

00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:45.420
and if you aren't a subscriber
yet to our channel,

00:12:45.420 --> 00:12:46.800

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:48.000
so you never miss
out on the fun.

00:12:48.300 --> 00:12:49.200
Don't forget to ring that bell,

00:12:49.212 --> 00:12:50.302
and we'll see you
in the next one.

00:12:50.452 --> 00:12:51.000
Talk to you then.
