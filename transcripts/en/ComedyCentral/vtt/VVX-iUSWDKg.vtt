00:00:01.166 --> 00:00:05.205
 ("Latino N' Proud by DJ Raff)

00:00:08.441 --> 00:00:09.675 line:0%
 - What's up guys, I'm Matt FX,

00:00:09.708 --> 00:00:11.210 line:0%
music supervisor of Broad City.

00:00:11.243 --> 00:00:13.546 align:start position:0% line:0%
  Broad City's a really dope
  show, shot in New York

00:00:13.579 --> 00:00:14.647 size:84% position:42%
  that I'm blessed
  to be working on.

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:16.783 align:start position:0%
  I've got an opportunity
  to put some really, really

00:00:16.816 --> 00:00:17.984 size:84% position:42%
  cool music in it.

00:00:18.017 --> 00:00:20.286 align:start position:0%
 Underground artists, both kind
 of in the world of hip-hop

00:00:20.319 --> 00:00:22.522 align:start size:88% position:13%
as well as the
electronic dance scene.

00:00:22.555 --> 00:00:25.358 size:88% position:44%
  A lot of music that Ilana
  and Abbi chose themselves,

00:00:25.391 --> 00:00:27.226 size:84% position:42%
  so let's dive in.

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:28.828 size:88% position:44%
  Starting off, we have an
  artist called Tony Quatrro

00:00:28.861 --> 00:00:29.996 size:88% position:44%
  with the track "Fast Car."

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.098 align:start position:0%
 Tony's an artist that I've
 been following a little while

00:00:32.131 --> 00:00:33.666 size:88% position:44%
 now, he's a DJ and
 producer living out

00:00:33.699 --> 00:00:35.068
 in Brooklyn, New York.

00:00:35.101 --> 00:00:36.803 align:start position:0%
 "Fast Car" worked
 perfectly in our scene with

00:00:36.836 --> 00:00:39.572 align:start size:88% position:13%
 Soulstice, our
 fictional bougie gym.

00:00:39.605 --> 00:00:43.242
 Got Abbi and Ilana in the gym
 with Abbi's trainer boss guy.

00:00:43.275 --> 00:00:44.410 size:88% position:44%
  - [Abbi] I didn't think...

00:00:44.443 --> 00:00:46.179 align:start size:88% position:13%
 - Woah, what happened
 to your face?

00:00:46.212 --> 00:00:47.047
 - Oh.

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.383 align:start size:88% position:13%
It's really
embarrassing, actually.

00:00:50.416 --> 00:00:52.185 size:88% position:44%
 I was doing parkour

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:54.253 size:84% position:42%
  just now.

00:00:54.286 --> 00:00:55.488 align:start size:88% position:13%
 - Abbi, that's great.
 - [Abbi] Yeah.

00:00:55.521 --> 00:00:57.190 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Using the city as your
gym, very Soulstice.

00:00:57.223 --> 00:01:00.293 align:start position:0%
 - Tony makes really awesome
 90s-inspired house music

00:01:00.326 --> 00:01:03.129 align:start position:0%
 and in the case of Soulstice,
 it seemed like the perfect

00:01:03.162 --> 00:01:04.530
 pump-up jam to play.

00:01:04.563 --> 00:01:06.399 align:start position:0%
 Next up we have a scene
 near the end of the episode

00:01:06.432 --> 00:01:08.101 size:88% position:44%
 in our coffee shop.

00:01:08.134 --> 00:01:09.469 size:84% position:42% line:0%
  The song's called "Same
  Sad Story" and the artist

00:01:09.502 --> 00:01:11.237 size:88% position:44% line:0%
  is Dawn Mitschele.

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:14.073 size:84% position:42%
  It's a pretentious, kind
  of snobby coffeeshop that

00:01:14.106 --> 00:01:15.575 size:88% position:44%
  Abbi's showing her art in.

00:01:15.608 --> 00:01:18.644
She's having a bit of an
argument with a barista.

00:01:18.677 --> 00:01:20.746 align:start position:0%
 Personally, if I was in
 that situation, I feel like

00:01:20.779 --> 00:01:23.216 align:start position:0%
  a sad, beautiful, moving,
  full track playing

00:01:23.249 --> 00:01:25.551 align:start position:0%
 very quietly in the
 background would be exactly

00:01:25.584 --> 00:01:26.819 size:88% position:44%
  the thing that set
  me over the edge

00:01:26.852 --> 00:01:29.255 align:start size:88% position:13%
so we figured this would
be the perfect track.

00:01:29.288 --> 00:01:32.725 size:88% position:44%
  ("Same Sad Story"
  by Dawn Mitschele)

00:01:32.758 --> 00:01:33.726
 - That's my...

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:35.695
 My drawing up there.

00:01:35.728 --> 00:01:38.598
 You're in a good spot for us.

00:01:38.631 --> 00:01:40.066 size:88% position:44%
  - I'll take the hamburger.

00:01:40.099 --> 00:01:42.835 align:start size:88% position:13%
 - Oh, that's actually
 not a menu item.

00:01:42.868 --> 00:01:44.504 size:84% position:42%
  It's art.

00:01:44.537 --> 00:01:45.738 align:start position:0%
 - I feel a little guilty
 playing the track for laughs,

00:01:45.771 --> 00:01:47.540 align:start size:88% position:13%
so apologies, Dawn, it's
a really great track

00:01:47.573 --> 00:01:49.475 align:start size:88% position:13%
 and all of you should
 go check it out.

00:01:49.508 --> 00:01:51.210 align:start size:88% position:13%
  - Do you know what
  a sandwich is?

00:01:51.243 --> 00:01:52.445 size:84% position:42%
  - Do you?
  - Yeah.

00:01:52.478 --> 00:01:55.148 align:start size:88% position:13%
 - 'Cause you don't
 have any meat in them.

00:01:55.181 --> 00:01:56.415
- Last but certainly not least,

00:01:56.448 --> 00:01:58.151 align:start size:88% position:13%
we've got a track called
"Start" by an artist,

00:01:58.184 --> 00:01:59.152 line:0%
 Ethan Gooding.

00:01:59.185 --> 00:02:01.020 line:0%
 "Start" is featured in
 one of out transitions

00:02:01.053 --> 00:02:01.821 size:88% position:44%
  in between scenes.

00:02:01.854 --> 00:02:03.289 align:start size:88% position:13%
  If you watch a
  bit of Broad City,

00:02:03.322 --> 00:02:04.657
 you'll start to get a
 sense of how it works.

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:05.691 align:start position:0%
  We've got these
  transitions kind of moving

00:02:05.725 --> 00:02:08.294 align:start position:0%
  the episode along, showing
  scenes of New York,

00:02:08.327 --> 00:02:10.029 size:84% position:42%
  what Abbi and Ilana might
  be seeing on their way

00:02:10.062 --> 00:02:11.597
 to the next location.

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:14.300 size:88% position:44%
  ("Start" by Ethan Gooding)

00:02:14.333 --> 00:02:15.668
 - Listen, don't mess
 this up for me, okay?

00:02:15.701 --> 00:02:17.136 align:start size:88% position:13%
 I'm gonna be a
 teacher here one day.

00:02:17.169 --> 00:02:18.604
 - These transitions
 are never very long,

00:02:18.637 --> 00:02:20.306 size:84% position:42%
  so it's all about finding
  the best three or four

00:02:20.339 --> 00:02:21.574
second snippet.

00:02:21.607 --> 00:02:23.042 size:88% position:44%
 Luckily, "Start" is
 one hell of a beat,

00:02:23.075 --> 00:02:26.078
 so that really wasn't
 very difficult for me.

00:02:26.111 --> 00:02:27.346
This has been our music
recap for Broad City's

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:29.615
fourth episode, "The Lock-Out."
