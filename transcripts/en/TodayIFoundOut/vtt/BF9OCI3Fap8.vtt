00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:16.060
The color of warning signals, smiley faces,
rubber duckies and the Sun (at least from

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:22.250
our perspective- in fact the Sun is white
if viewed from space), for many of us yellow

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:26.070
has a favorable connotation; yet, at various
points throughout human history, yellow has

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.340
decidedly been a symbolism of, alternately,
heresy, jealousy, treachery, sin and gutlessness.

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:36.540
It’s not completely clear when yellow came
to represent human weakness and immorality.

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.750
In fact, during the Early Middle Ages (5th-10th
centuries), yellow (as a cheaper substitute

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:46.770
for gold) was commonly used to represent divine
light in art and manuscripts, and even Jesus

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.140
was sometimes depicted with blond hair.

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.430
However, during the High Middle Ages (11th-15th
centuries), things began to change.

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:58.550
Although it’s not clear why the color was
chosen, as part of the Abilgensian Inquisition

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:04.080
(mid-13th century), which started in the 1100s
in France, Cathar heretics who repented were

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.990
forced to wear yellow crosses as part of their
penance.

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.690
Similarly, Jews, widely despised by other
religions at the time, had been forced to

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:15.860
wear some type of marker since the days of
the Umayyad Caliph Umar II (8th century),

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:20.740
and by the 12th century Jewish men in Baghdad
each wore two yellow badges (one on the head

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:22.240
and another on the neck).

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.910
This practice of marking Jews in yellow continued
throughout the Middle Ages and the Renaissance,

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:30.840
with the symbols themselves being variously
rings, circles, patches, strips of cloth,

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.580
badges, belts and hats.

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:37.210
By the late 14th century, Venetian prostitutes
were also wearing yellow – a practice that

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:41.430
spread throughout Italy during the Renaissance;
reflecting this, in Renaissance artwork Mary

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.509
Magdalene was often depicted in yellow as
well.

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:50.840
By the time of the Spanish Inquisition (1478-1834),
heretics were dressed in tunics of yellow

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.320
cloth called a Sanbenito (for Saint Benedict).

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:57.090
Moreover, from the late Middle Ages yellow
had been associated with falsehood, treason

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.549
and treachery; Judas was also often depicted
wearing yellow at this time.

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:05.810
By the early 17th century, the negative symbolism
of yellow had expanded to refer to jealousy

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:12.590
as well, as seen in Thomas Dekker’s North-ward
Hoe (1607): “Iealous men are eyther kaues

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.810
or Coxcombes, bee you neither; you weare yellow
hose without cause.”

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:21.880
Notably, yellow still retains a connotation
meaning along these lines, today, and particularly

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:27.190
with regard to unscrupulous and recklessly
sensational journalism; its earliest appearance

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:33.040
in an English language publication was The
Daily News (London) (Mar 2 1898): “The yellow

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.650
Press is for a war with Spain, at all costs.”

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:41.210
Yellow continued its descent in the late 18th
century when the phrase yellow-belly was first

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:46.710
identified as a xenophobic, derogatory term,
as set out in Grose’s A provincial glossary

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:52.410
(1787): “Yellow bellies . . . an appellation
given to persons born in the Fends . . . who

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:54.720
. . . have yellow bellies, like their eels.”

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:59.600
It’s not clear if this insult was intended
to convey cowardice at the time, but the singular

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:03.561
yellow seems to have by 1856 when it appeared
in P.T.

00:03:03.561 --> 00:03:07.440
Barnum’s Struggles &amp; Triumphs, yellow did:
“We never thought your heart was yellow.”

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:11.880
Completing the circle, yellow-bellied for
cowardly was first seen definitively in English

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:17.430
language print in 1924, in Percy Marks The
Plastic Age when he wrote: “Yellow-bellied

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:18.430
quiters.”

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:22.090
It has been suggested that yellow-bellied,
meaning a coward, may have been inspired by

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:25.610
chicken egg yolks being yellow and chicken
meaning coward.

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:29.310
However, this cannot be as chicken with this
definition didn’t pop up until around the

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:30.889
mid-20th century.

00:03:30.889 --> 00:03:35.400
An alternate more compelling, yet no less
speculative, hypothesis has it that yellow-bellied,

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:39.690
meaning coward, was inspired by someone with
“guts” being referred to as courageous-

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:44.799
thus those with “yellow guts” (yellow-bellied)
have “fake” courage, borrowing from one

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:47.750
of the former definitions of yellow meaning
falsehood.

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:52.060
This is somewhat plausible as, despite the
fact that for most of the 19th century guts

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:56.240
or gutsy actually meant “greedy,” around
the turn of the century the “courageous”

00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:01.860
definition of guts began gaining steam, first
attested in 1893, a few decades before the

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:17.930
first definitive instance of yellow-bellied
meaning someone who lacks courage.
