00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
I hope the correct answer is the third choice--

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
that the running time is exponential in the size of X.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
We're looping through the values from 2 to X.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
So if X is N bits, that's going to require 2 to the N iterations,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
and for each one we're computing this modulo.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
So this is not going to work if X is large.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
And in order to use primes in cryptography,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
we need to find large primes.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
So we need a faster prime test.
