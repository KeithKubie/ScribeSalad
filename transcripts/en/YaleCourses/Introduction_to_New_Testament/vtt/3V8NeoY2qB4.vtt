1
00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:01.711
All right.

2
00:00:01.711 --> 00:00:06.711
The last time we talked about the historical Jesus and I talked about some of

3
00:00:06.961 --> 00:00:09.180
the methodology that,
uh,

4
00:00:09.181 --> 00:00:14.181
scholars debate about what criteria you use to figure out what in the gospels

5
00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.360
might tell you something about the actual historical Jesus and what may be later

6
00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:26.030
writing are myths or legends are additions of the Gospel writers themselves.

7
00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.050
There's a very similar kind of problem with Paul and that,
uh,

8
00:00:31.051 --> 00:00:35.880
it's rather debatable what we know historically about the historical Paul,

9
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.950
uh,
than what we find in different literary accounts with Paul.

10
00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.850
There's a lot more to go on for one thing is I'll explain later today we

11
00:00:44.851 --> 00:00:46.120
actually have,
uh,

12
00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:51.090
at least seven letters from Paul that he wrote himself that most scholars

13
00:00:51.091 --> 00:00:54.170
believe are actually authentic to Paul.
Uh,

14
00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.220
then we have some other letters that are written,
his name.

15
00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.920
We also have the traditions that are in the gospel of,

16
00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:01.230
I mean the book of acts of the Apostles,
which you've read,

17
00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.170
which talk about Paul and his travels.
So we,

18
00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:06.300
there's a lot more material to go on with Paul,

19
00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.450
but there's still quite a bit of debate about what is historical about Paul and

20
00:01:11.581 --> 00:01:14.790
what is later legend or what is stuff that's just in some of the letters that

21
00:01:14.791 --> 00:01:17.570
may not have been by him at all.
In fact,
if you remember,

22
00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.820
we go back to the lecture we had to the very beginning of the semester,

23
00:01:20.821 --> 00:01:23.760
one of the Times where we talked about what,

24
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.510
where does Paul go when in the book of acts,
where does he go?

25
00:01:27.511 --> 00:01:29.070
According to Galatians one and two.

26
00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.990
And at that point I tried to show that the two accounts of pause,

27
00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:35.910
a back and forth between Damascus and Jerusalem,

28
00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.540
the amount of time he spent in Jerusalem when he was there for how long,

29
00:01:39.541 --> 00:01:40.920
who he saw,
who knew him.

30
00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.040
All those different things that are presented in the book of acts.

31
00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:49.140
I argued or probably not historical because if we've got Paul's own descriptions

32
00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.380
of his movements and Galatians one and two,
uh,

33
00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:56.100
it's much more likely we think that we have more accurate historical material

34
00:01:56.101 --> 00:01:58.320
from Galatians than we do from acts.

35
00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.000
But that's one of the places we would go is first to try to see what we've

36
00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:03.540
gotten acts,
what do we have in his letters?

37
00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:08.670
So this is a controversial thing to what I've said is Paul probably didn't spend

38
00:02:08.671 --> 00:02:12.900
nearly as much time in Jerusalem as the acts of the apostles wants to make it

39
00:02:12.901 --> 00:02:14.000
sound like,
uh,

40
00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:19.050
I don't believe he started off his ministry in Jerusalem as acts makes it sound

41
00:02:19.321 --> 00:02:23.160
to be,
there'll be other things about Paul that I'll talk about today,
uh,

42
00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:28.220
from acts that I at least believe we should doubt whether they're historical or

43
00:02:28.321 --> 00:02:32.370
at least we can't use them in any kind of dependable way as providing a

44
00:02:32.371 --> 00:02:34.560
biography of the apostle Paul.

45
00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.410
What does Paul though tell us about himself?
Okay,
first,

46
00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.920
well,
actually let me say that that's not all there is with Paul.

47
00:02:43.921 --> 00:02:48.390
There's a ton of more material about Paul that you have to work through in the

48
00:02:48.391 --> 00:02:52.450
whole European tradition.
Paul has been thought of,
uh,

49
00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:55.440
as the founder of Christianity.

50
00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:58.320
Some people have said Jesus was not really the founder of Christianity.

51
00:02:58.321 --> 00:03:00.970
He was a moral,
he went around and talking about different things.

52
00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:03.340
Paul was the one who really founded Christianity.

53
00:03:03.341 --> 00:03:04.570
He was the one who built churches.

54
00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.810
He was one who came up with the dogmas and doctrines of Christianity.

55
00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:11.140
He's the one who preached that.
What's the central central aspect of faith?

56
00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:15.430
His faith in a crucified Messiah who's been raised by God and it's faith in

57
00:03:15.431 --> 00:03:17.620
Christ.
It's the foundation of Christianity,

58
00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:20.500
not what some might people say.

59
00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:24.760
Jesus of Nazareth own faithfulness to God himself.

60
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.910
All of these things people have said makes Paul Moore the founder of

61
00:03:27.911 --> 00:03:32.050
Christianity than uh,
than Jesus is.
In fact,
though,

62
00:03:32.051 --> 00:03:37.051
Paul has been read in so many different ways throughout the last 2000 years that

63
00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:40.420
people have even compared him to proteus.

64
00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:44.530
Does anybody remember the Homeric figure of Proteus from the Odyssey?

65
00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:51.780
Anybody who know proteus is this guy that is captured by a decease in his

66
00:03:51.971 --> 00:03:54.580
sailors and they're trying to get a secret out of him.

67
00:03:54.581 --> 00:03:58.300
So they hold onto him and he turns into different things.

68
00:03:58.301 --> 00:04:02.320
He turns into different animals and he turns and they keep holding onto him

69
00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:04.840
until he finally turns back into a man.

70
00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:09.790
And then they can force him to give him their secret.
So people,
uh,
Wayne Meeks,

71
00:04:09.791 --> 00:04:13.060
my predecessor in the chair I occupy here at Yale,

72
00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:17.020
published a book in which it's just come out in a second edition in which he

73
00:04:17.021 --> 00:04:20.770
talks about the apostle Paul and how he's been a represented throughout history.

74
00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:22.300
And in his essay,

75
00:04:22.301 --> 00:04:27.301
he calls Paul the Protean Apostle because Paul himself even says,

76
00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:32.440
I have become all things to all people in First Corinthians nine.

77
00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:35.890
So is Paul the kind of person who everybody makes out of him,

78
00:04:35.891 --> 00:04:37.030
whatever they want to make out of them,

79
00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:40.060
he turns into different kinds of things according to who's looking at him.

80
00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:43.960
And that's exactly the way Paul has come across in many different aspects of,
um,

81
00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:47.230
western history.
The early church,
for example,

82
00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:52.320
didn't think of Paul as being so much the great theologian that sometimes he

83
00:04:52.361 --> 00:04:55.750
became in later Christian tradition.
They certainly didn't think of him as their,

84
00:04:55.751 --> 00:04:59.950
sort of the best Protestant apostle as he would become for Lutherans.

85
00:04:59.951 --> 00:05:03.910
And for Calvinist,
Paul was mainly known as a martyr.

86
00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:08.350
So in the early church,
when you see Paul depicted in art and in literature,

87
00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:12.790
most often,
he's not depicted so much.
Uh,
as this great theologian,

88
00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:14.950
he's depicted as the great martyr who is,

89
00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:18.070
whose head was cut off in Rome.

90
00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:22.210
So the Great Martyr Apostle is the early church's way of looking at him.

91
00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:27.550
But then Saint Augustine and then following him,
Martin Luther,

92
00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:29.050
they saw on Paul,

93
00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:32.710
someone who is more like their own sort of psychological way of thinking about

94
00:05:32.711 --> 00:05:37.540
themselves.
They saw Paul is this guy who was really trying to be righteous.

95
00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:40.900
He tried to do everything.
He was a catholic monk,
and so he was,

96
00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:44.170
he was trying to do all the kinds of things that the Catholic Church expected.

97
00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:49.380
And he just became crushed under all the requirements of doctrine and ethics and

98
00:05:49.601 --> 00:05:53.260
Christian and Catholic requirements.
And he finally,
he was,

99
00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:56.800
he felt like I have to be perfect in order to be,
to be acceptable to God.

100
00:05:56.890 --> 00:06:00.080
But no matter how much I try,
I can't do it.
I can't keep the law.

101
00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:03.590
I can't keep the church's teachings.
I'm this total moral failure.

102
00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:08.360
And so they read Paul as this person who experienced his life as trying to live

103
00:06:08.361 --> 00:06:09.800
up to the requirements of God,

104
00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:14.450
which they interpret it as the law and just found that you couldn't do it.

105
00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:18.800
And this expressed for them a sort of universal human experience that all of us

106
00:06:18.801 --> 00:06:21.680
feel when we try to live up to very demanding,

107
00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:24.980
ethical and moral guidelines.
And we find out we can't,

108
00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:28.730
we always fall short of what God wants us to do.

109
00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:32.150
None of us is perfect.
We are always,
we're all sinners.

110
00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:36.740
And so this idea that Paul represented this psychological,
uh,

111
00:06:36.741 --> 00:06:39.660
struggling figure,
trying to be righteous and,

112
00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:42.590
and trying to earn his righteousness by works.

113
00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:46.730
And then all of a sudden discovering when he read Galatians and Romans,
oh wait,

114
00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:50.150
we're saved by faith apart.
We're saved by grace through faith,
apart from works,

115
00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:51.500
therefore works don't matter.

116
00:06:51.501 --> 00:06:54.830
Therefore all the Roman Catholic requirements that we have to do this and that,

117
00:06:54.831 --> 00:06:58.340
that that's not where salvation comes from.
It comes from simply your faith.

118
00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:02.690
So this Paul then became the Paul,
not the ancient,
you know,

119
00:07:02.691 --> 00:07:04.610
Christian Martyr Apostle.
So much.

120
00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:09.760
But the Paul of the psychological discovery that True Gospel is you're saved by

121
00:07:10.941 --> 00:07:11.990
grace through faith.

122
00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:16.160
It's nothing you can do and therefore it works with the law don't matter with

123
00:07:16.161 --> 00:07:16.994
you and God.

124
00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:22.000
So the Great Lutheran Protestant Paul then becomes invented as this man who had

125
00:07:22.611 --> 00:07:24.110
this psychological struggle.

126
00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:28.220
And through this psychological struggle broke out through that,
into this,
uh,

127
00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:30.680
discovery of grace,
the grace of God.

128
00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:36.530
So that became this anguished guilt ridden Paul who discovers grace.

129
00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:37.640
And that's been one of the,

130
00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:42.140
the main figure of Paul that you get in Protestantism ever since Martin Luther

131
00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:46.160
and John Calvin.
And as I said,
there are other people,
and even in the modern,

132
00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:49.070
the 19th and 20th century,
who became worse than in history,

133
00:07:49.190 --> 00:07:54.190
and they noticed that Paul Paul's letters don't sound like what you get from

134
00:07:54.471 --> 00:07:58.130
Jesus in the gospels.
They just sound like different kinds of stuff.

135
00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:02.060
Jesus was preaching the Kingdom of God was going to come.

136
00:08:02.570 --> 00:08:07.570
Paul preaches Jesus as the King Jesus as the Messiah.

137
00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:13.040
In fact,
people said the message of Jesus was about God and the kingdom.

138
00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:17.000
By the time you get to Paul,
Paul's message is about Jesus himself.

139
00:08:17.930 --> 00:08:20.690
So this shift of the proclaimer,

140
00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:25.720
Jesus becoming the proclaimed in Paul that is Jesus being proclaimed by Paul is

141
00:08:26.541 --> 00:08:29.270
one of the shifts that historians notes in the 19th 20th century.

142
00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:34.610
So all of this stuff sorted or different ways of figuring Paul in history.
Um,

143
00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:38.990
in fact,
one of the ways that people talked about this was Paul was actually the

144
00:08:38.991 --> 00:08:43.340
corruptor of the Nobel pristine religion of Jesus.

145
00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:45.440
Jesus was a great moral teacher.

146
00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:49.640
He didn't care about all these Christian doctrines about the trinity and about,

147
00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:52.580
you know,
hell and heaven and all this kind of stuff.

148
00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:57.150
Jesus was just saying things like,
consider the lilies of the field,

149
00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:02.070
how they grow.
They toil.
Not Neither do they spin.

150
00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:07.140
And yet I say that it's Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of

151
00:09:07.141 --> 00:09:09.570
these.
I should be in a movie,
right?

152
00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:14.820
Jesus of Nazareth at Yale
or you know,

153
00:09:14.821 --> 00:09:17.940
so Jesus comes across sometimes as being this,
you know,

154
00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:22.200
moral teacher who's floating around on boats and that'll sea of Galilee with his

155
00:09:22.201 --> 00:09:25.650
disciples saying things.
Consider the sparrow.

156
00:09:26.130 --> 00:09:29.640
And then Jay Paul comes along according to this reading and he turns all that

157
00:09:29.641 --> 00:09:34.470
into this stuff about doctrine and hell and heaven and doing the right thing and

158
00:09:34.471 --> 00:09:37.230
God's condemnation.
So for these kinds of people,

159
00:09:37.770 --> 00:09:42.330
Paul was actually the founder of Christianity because he destroyed the kind of

160
00:09:42.331 --> 00:09:44.820
message that the historical Jesus taught.

161
00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:47.520
This is what you get from someone like Friedrich Nietzsche,

162
00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:52.530
who wasn't that crazy about Jesus,
but he really hated Paul.

163
00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:56.700
So Nicha said this,
this is Paul,

164
00:09:56.701 --> 00:10:00.060
the corruptor of Jesus religion.
This is that kind of Paul,

165
00:10:00.690 --> 00:10:03.960
the glad tidings,
that is the gospel,
the good news.

166
00:10:04.470 --> 00:10:08.760
We're followed closely by the absolutely worst tidings,

167
00:10:08.761 --> 00:10:10.290
those of Saint Paul.

168
00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:15.840
Paul is the incarnation of a type which is the reverse of that of the savior.

169
00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:18.810
He is a genius in hatred,

170
00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:21.660
in the standpoint of hatred.

171
00:10:22.830 --> 00:10:27.830
Nicha goes on to talk about Paul by making the heroic but unfortunate death of

172
00:10:27.871 --> 00:10:32.280
Jesus into a sacrifice for sin,
which is what Nisha thought Paul had done,

173
00:10:33.390 --> 00:10:37.680
nailed Christ to his cross.
That's what Nisha says about Paul.

174
00:10:38.190 --> 00:10:41.820
The Cross was Paul's invention for Christianity.

175
00:10:41.821 --> 00:10:46.650
And that's what made Christianity or George Bernard Shaw,
he has a great thing.

176
00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:48.870
When I was at high school kid,
remember I told you about this?

177
00:10:49.050 --> 00:10:52.590
I grew up in this very conservative church in Texas and I went to this big

178
00:10:52.591 --> 00:10:56.190
public high school and I mean I'd gone to Sunday school my whole life and I

179
00:10:56.191 --> 00:10:58.920
wasn't very well read in literature.
Well,

180
00:10:58.980 --> 00:11:03.510
in high school we were reading some plays by George Bernard Shaw and we were

181
00:11:03.511 --> 00:11:05.880
assigned,
I think mainly the play.
Uh,

182
00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:09.030
and I was flipping through a bunch of George [inaudible] and I came across

183
00:11:09.031 --> 00:11:11.370
Andrew cleaning the lion,
I think was the name of the play.

184
00:11:11.371 --> 00:11:12.820
You know about the Andrew [inaudible],

185
00:11:12.830 --> 00:11:15.960
the young man who finds the line with the thorn in his Paul.

186
00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:19.890
He pulls the thorn out of the lion's Paul and then the lines very grateful.

187
00:11:19.890 --> 00:11:22.260
And then years,
years,
years later,
Andrew,
please becomes a Christian.

188
00:11:22.410 --> 00:11:27.060
And he's thrown into the,
into the lion,
until the lions in the Roman Coliseum.

189
00:11:27.330 --> 00:11:29.970
And it just so happens that the lion who's thought,
who's Paul,

190
00:11:29.971 --> 00:11:32.220
he cured is the one who's supposed to eat him.

191
00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:35.610
And of course the line comes up and recognizes them and licks him and saved him.

192
00:11:35.611 --> 00:11:38.160
And so Andrew cleaning the line is this story about,
you know,

193
00:11:38.161 --> 00:11:43.020
the Christian martyr who say by the lion,
well that's the play,
but Shawl,

194
00:11:43.021 --> 00:11:47.520
you always upended these wonderful introductions to his place.

195
00:11:47.850 --> 00:11:51.480
And sometimes the introductions are more interesting than the plays themselves.

196
00:11:51.481 --> 00:11:55.300
Cause this is where a Shaw who is a wonderful atheist and the beginning of the

197
00:11:55.301 --> 00:12:00.301
20th century where he just lets loose and he just slams all kinds of political

198
00:12:00.851 --> 00:12:05.530
stuff,
but a lot of religion,
he just really doesn't like religion.
So he in his,

199
00:12:05.531 --> 00:12:08.470
uh,
I remember coming across into the library or something and here I was,

200
00:12:08.471 --> 00:12:12.430
this pious little,
you know,
Protestant boy growing up in my conservative church.

201
00:12:12.730 --> 00:12:13.960
And here's this guy,
very,

202
00:12:13.961 --> 00:12:18.940
very smart in this introduction to Andrew plays in the lion explaining to me how

203
00:12:18.941 --> 00:12:23.440
bad Christianity was really and how Paul had screwed the whole thing up.

204
00:12:24.370 --> 00:12:28.900
It was kind of blew my mind.
You know,
was like,
took me days to get over this,

205
00:12:29.170 --> 00:12:32.530
but George Bernard Shaw said this about Paul.

206
00:12:33.310 --> 00:12:38.310
No sooner had Jesus knocked over the dragon of superstition than Paul boldly set

207
00:12:40.571 --> 00:12:43.750
it up on its legs again in the name of Jesus.

208
00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:49.330
So Paul is the one who makes Jesus's movement.
Superstitious are here.

209
00:12:49.390 --> 00:12:50.230
He said this also,

210
00:12:50.470 --> 00:12:55.470
Paul is the true head and founder of our reformed church as Peter is of the

211
00:12:56.231 --> 00:12:57.250
Roman church,

212
00:12:57.760 --> 00:13:02.760
the followers of p of Paul and Peter Made Christendom while the Nazarenes were

213
00:13:04.361 --> 00:13:08.800
wiped out.
So the religion of Jesus,

214
00:13:08.801 --> 00:13:10.990
according to Sean,
disappeared from the earth.

215
00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:15.310
And all that we were left with is this shell called Christendom.

216
00:13:16.180 --> 00:13:20.980
So all those things are Paul.
So we're going to talk about for the next few days,

217
00:13:20.981 --> 00:13:24.310
we're going to talk about Paul,
both the authentic letters he wrote.

218
00:13:24.311 --> 00:13:25.840
We're going to try to figure out who he was,

219
00:13:26.230 --> 00:13:29.410
and then we're going to talk about how he was depicted by his own followers in

220
00:13:29.411 --> 00:13:32.260
the Bible and then by some of his followers outside of the Bible.

221
00:13:32.710 --> 00:13:36.430
What does Paul tell us about himself?
There are some important things,

222
00:13:36.431 --> 00:13:41.230
but they're just a couple of details.
One in Philippians three,

223
00:13:41.530 --> 00:13:44.200
five to six.
So Philippians three,
five and six,

224
00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:47.590
Paul tells us that he was of the tribe of Benjamin,

225
00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:51.580
so he even knows his tribal identity identity as a Jew.

226
00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:56.920
He was a pharisee.
Now that surprises some people.
In fact,

227
00:13:56.921 --> 00:13:59.590
Paul doesn't ever say I used to be a fair seat,
but I'm no longer.

228
00:13:59.591 --> 00:14:04.330
He basically just called himself a pharisee that Paul's the one Pharisee from

229
00:14:04.331 --> 00:14:08.980
priest 70,
uh,
Judaism that we know much about at all.

230
00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:12.700
We don't know,
a lot of the rabbis of the Pharisees appear in rabbinic documents,

231
00:14:12.701 --> 00:14:14.290
but those come from hundreds of years later.

232
00:14:14.530 --> 00:14:18.280
Paul's one person who calls himself a pharisee and whose writings we actually

233
00:14:18.281 --> 00:14:20.860
possess.
So Paul calls himself a pharisee.

234
00:14:21.250 --> 00:14:25.240
He says that he was a persecutor of the church before he became a follower of

235
00:14:25.241 --> 00:14:29.110
Jesus.
And he implies that this was out of zeal for the law.

236
00:14:29.590 --> 00:14:33.670
So Paul started off as a very law abiding,
in fact,

237
00:14:33.671 --> 00:14:36.280
zealous for the law Jew,

238
00:14:36.580 --> 00:14:38.680
even to the point of being a pharisee.

239
00:14:38.980 --> 00:14:43.240
And he says in Philippians that he was righteous under the law.
Now,

240
00:14:43.241 --> 00:14:46.210
this is one of the reasons that scholars in the last part of the 20th century

241
00:14:46.211 --> 00:14:51.211
started questioning this more Lutheran idea that Paul came to his knowledge of

242
00:14:51.561 --> 00:14:55.550
grace because he felt like he couldn't keep the law.
I've tried to keep the law.

243
00:14:55.551 --> 00:14:58.520
I just can't keep the law.
I've tried.
I just can't do it.
Well,

244
00:14:58.521 --> 00:15:03.020
he tells us in Philippians that he actually was pretty righteous with the law,

245
00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:08.000
so maybe Paul didn't have such a problem with the law after all for that reason.

246
00:15:08.540 --> 00:15:13.540
Those are the things he tells us in Philippians in Galatians five 11 he also

247
00:15:13.911 --> 00:15:17.390
says at one point,
am I still preaching circumcision

248
00:15:19.220 --> 00:15:22.790
that just kind of hangs there?
Am I still preaching circumcision?

249
00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:27.500
The one thing that at least tells us is that Paul at one time preached

250
00:15:27.501 --> 00:15:32.450
circumcision was that maybe the reason that he was persecuting these followers

251
00:15:32.451 --> 00:15:37.190
of Jesus is that some of them were not preaching circumcision or we don't know.

252
00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:38.421
Now,

253
00:15:38.421 --> 00:15:41.660
there are several other things about Paul that we don't get from his letters,

254
00:15:41.870 --> 00:15:45.560
but that if you pick up most books on Paul nowadays at the bookstore,

255
00:15:45.561 --> 00:15:47.780
they'd probably tell you these things about Paul's biography.

256
00:15:47.930 --> 00:15:51.140
But these are things that we only find in the acts of the apostles.

257
00:15:51.650 --> 00:15:53.240
And as I've tried to get you to see,

258
00:15:53.420 --> 00:15:55.940
there are a lot of things in the acts of the apostles that we should doubt their

259
00:15:55.941 --> 00:15:58.940
historicity,
especially when it comes to Paul.

260
00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:02.860
So some of the things about Paul that people think they know about Paula's

261
00:16:02.900 --> 00:16:07.220
historical facts only come from acts.
What are those one?

262
00:16:08.030 --> 00:16:13.030
He was brought up and educated in Jerusalem at the feet of Gamaliel,

263
00:16:13.730 --> 00:16:16.550
a very famous first century rabbi.
Well,

264
00:16:16.551 --> 00:16:19.340
it's only an ax that Paul says that about himself.

265
00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:24.260
Is this something that Luke kind of made up or put in there?
A part of tradition?

266
00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:28.130
His original name was Saul.
According to acts,

267
00:16:28.670 --> 00:16:32.210
Paul never tells us that himself.
It's not too unlikely.

268
00:16:32.211 --> 00:16:37.211
A lot of Jews then as Jews now might have two separate names,

269
00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:40.760
you know,
sort of their American named in their Israeli name or something,

270
00:16:40.770 --> 00:16:44.960
their Hebrew name and their English name.
So maybe Paul did have two names,

271
00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:47.630
but he never called himself salt in his letters.

272
00:16:47.900 --> 00:16:49.880
That's a name that he's given an ax.

273
00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:54.770
He also says in acts that he's a Roman citizen and that he was born a Roman

274
00:16:54.771 --> 00:16:55.604
citizen.

275
00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:00.080
That's pretty impressive thing for a Jew in the eastern part of the Metro

276
00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:04.400
Uranian to be a Roman citizen.
And the first part of the first century,

277
00:17:04.580 --> 00:17:06.050
that would have been fairly unusual,

278
00:17:07.220 --> 00:17:12.090
but Paul claims that enacts but only in acts in acts,
Paul is,

279
00:17:12.350 --> 00:17:16.250
is portrayed as speaking Hebrew fluently.
He gets it,

280
00:17:16.251 --> 00:17:18.440
gets up in Jerusalem and gives a whole long speeches.

281
00:17:18.470 --> 00:17:21.110
In Hebrew it may mean Aramaic,

282
00:17:21.111 --> 00:17:24.950
but sometimes in ancient Greek texts they'll say Hebrew.

283
00:17:24.951 --> 00:17:27.710
And what we think they probably were talking was Aramaic,

284
00:17:27.711 --> 00:17:31.610
which is kind of a dialogue,
a dialect of Hebrew and Syriac.
So,

285
00:17:31.850 --> 00:17:36.470
but Paul seems to be speaking Hebrew and ex Paul never in his letters gives us

286
00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:39.080
any indication that he spoke Hebrew.

287
00:17:40.580 --> 00:17:43.640
So did he speak Hebrew?
He seemed,

288
00:17:43.940 --> 00:17:47.600
I would say Greek at least seems to be his first language and we don't have any

289
00:17:47.601 --> 00:17:50.280
direct indication that he spoke Hebrew.

290
00:17:51.570 --> 00:17:55.440
And then one of the things that's important for us today,
according to acts,

291
00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:58.440
Paul's normal modus operandi,

292
00:17:58.470 --> 00:18:03.470
his way of operating was to go to a town and go to the synagogue first.

293
00:18:03.750 --> 00:18:07.320
And only after he was rejected in the synagogue would he then go preach to the

294
00:18:07.321 --> 00:18:08.730
gentiles?
Do you remember?

295
00:18:08.731 --> 00:18:12.900
This goes along with that ax theme that we talked about to the Jew first and

296
00:18:12.901 --> 00:18:13.860
then to the Greeks.

297
00:18:14.370 --> 00:18:17.130
So look with me because we're going to talk about first Thessalonians in a bit.

298
00:18:17.730 --> 00:18:22.730
Acts 17 gives the account of when Paul first went to festival Anika,

299
00:18:24.300 --> 00:18:26.730
at least according to acts now festival,

300
00:18:26.731 --> 00:18:30.630
Annika is an important Roman city on in the,

301
00:18:30.631 --> 00:18:31.740
in Macedonia.

302
00:18:31.980 --> 00:18:36.030
That is the home area of Alexander the Great and Philip his father,

303
00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:38.850
which is now considered by the Romans,

304
00:18:38.851 --> 00:18:43.350
sort of proud of mainly the sort of the area that's ruled also with a Kia or

305
00:18:43.351 --> 00:18:45.420
Greece.
It's a Greek speaking area,

306
00:18:45.570 --> 00:18:48.510
but that's the one I get is a Roman kind of city.
It's,

307
00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:50.100
it's romanized to some extent.

308
00:18:50.220 --> 00:18:53.220
It's right on a major highway running east to west.

309
00:18:53.340 --> 00:18:58.000
So it's an important place and here's the way acts describes Paul's getting to

310
00:18:58.070 --> 00:18:58.830
Thessalonica.

311
00:18:58.830 --> 00:19:01.110
Now what I'm going to do is I'm going to read this carefully because we're going

312
00:19:01.111 --> 00:19:02.940
to then go to first Thessalonians and say,

313
00:19:03.090 --> 00:19:08.090
can we confirm any of the acts material from Paul's own description about what

314
00:19:08.851 --> 00:19:12.780
happened in vessel and not go after Paul and Silas.

315
00:19:12.870 --> 00:19:17.370
This is x 17 one had passed through [inaudible] and Apollonia.

316
00:19:17.550 --> 00:19:22.550
They came to the festival and Naca where there was a synagogue of the Jews and

317
00:19:23.161 --> 00:19:28.161
Paul went in as was his custom and on three Sabbath days argued with them from

318
00:19:28.921 --> 00:19:32.730
the scriptures explaining and proving that it was necessary for the Messiah to

319
00:19:32.731 --> 00:19:37.320
suffer and to rise from the dead and saying,
this is the Messiah,

320
00:19:37.560 --> 00:19:40.830
the Christ Jesus,
whom I am proclaiming to you.

321
00:19:41.490 --> 00:19:46.290
Some of them were persuaded and joined Paul and Silas as did a great many of the

322
00:19:46.291 --> 00:19:49.710
devout Greeks and not a few leading women.

323
00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:54.770
Luke likes that phrase case.
If you read,
these are kind of he,

324
00:19:54.930 --> 00:19:59.730
he likes to say that a few leading women also were converted in different

325
00:19:59.731 --> 00:20:01.230
places.
It's more than one place he does this,

326
00:20:02.010 --> 00:20:05.670
but the Jews I we see that turn that we've often seen an ax.

327
00:20:06.060 --> 00:20:09.660
The Jews became jealous and with the help of some rough Ian's in the

328
00:20:09.661 --> 00:20:10.500
marketplaces,

329
00:20:10.890 --> 00:20:15.750
they formed a mob and set the city in an uproar while they were searching for

330
00:20:15.751 --> 00:20:17.910
Paul and Silas to bring them up to the assembly.

331
00:20:18.750 --> 00:20:22.470
They attacked Jason's house when they could not find them.

332
00:20:22.471 --> 00:20:26.640
They dragged Jason and some believers before the city authorities shouting.

333
00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:30.300
These people who have been turning the world upside down have come here also,

334
00:20:30.510 --> 00:20:32.550
and Jason has entertained them as guests.

335
00:20:32.970 --> 00:20:36.400
They are all acting contrary to the decrees of the emperor saying that there's

336
00:20:36.420 --> 00:20:38.460
another king named Jesus.

337
00:20:39.030 --> 00:20:42.570
The people in the city officials were disturbed when they heard this and after

338
00:20:42.571 --> 00:20:44.730
they had taken bail from Jason and the others,

339
00:20:44.910 --> 00:20:47.740
they let them go that very night.

340
00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:51.910
The believers sent Paul and Silas off to Berea,
and when they arrived,

341
00:20:51.911 --> 00:20:54.790
they went to the Jewish synagogue.
So they're arrested.

342
00:20:54.791 --> 00:20:57.960
They have to post bail and then during the night they send them off,

343
00:20:57.990 --> 00:21:00.250
get them out of town,
and they go to Berea.
And again,

344
00:21:00.251 --> 00:21:04.470
Paul and Silas go first to the synagogue.
That's the account,
uh,

345
00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:07.780
from x.
Now let's look though at first Thessalonians,

346
00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:09.220
and let's compare a few things here.

347
00:21:11.350 --> 00:21:13.870
First we're going to ask,

348
00:21:14.140 --> 00:21:17.980
what does first Thessalonians tell us about several things?

349
00:21:20.050 --> 00:21:23.560
How did Paul Work as a missionary?
How did he do this?

350
00:21:23.561 --> 00:21:28.561
He was going around trying to convince gentiles to accept that Jesus of

351
00:21:29.351 --> 00:21:31.630
Nazareth,
this guy they had never heard of before,

352
00:21:32.110 --> 00:21:37.110
who had been executed by the Romans way off in a corner of the world in

353
00:21:37.361 --> 00:21:41.200
Jerusalem,
that this guy was not only the new king of the Jews,

354
00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:44.260
he had been raised from the dead and make king of the Jews.

355
00:21:44.500 --> 00:21:46.480
But then now he's going to be king of the whole world.

356
00:21:46.840 --> 00:21:51.840
And that even gentiles should be loyal to him and they should all become loyal

357
00:21:51.881 --> 00:21:53.350
to the god of Israel.

358
00:21:53.770 --> 00:21:57.760
Precisely because the god of Israel had raised this Jesus guy from the dead.

359
00:21:58.180 --> 00:22:02.770
And therefore he demanded faith and adherence and worship from all the world,

360
00:22:02.830 --> 00:22:05.980
even gentiles.
And that's so that's what he's doing.

361
00:22:05.981 --> 00:22:08.380
He's going around to different towns and he's trying to plant little house

362
00:22:08.381 --> 00:22:12.880
churches,
little cell groups in the different cities of the Greeks where he goes.

363
00:22:13.390 --> 00:22:15.700
So here's what he talks about in first Thessalonians,

364
00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:20.290
he gives this long thanksgiving,
Paul Sylvain Sylvain,

365
00:22:20.291 --> 00:22:22.600
this is the Latinized name of Silas.

366
00:22:22.630 --> 00:22:25.950
So we're talking about the same person that acts called Silas called Sylvania

367
00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:30.100
here and Timothy to the Church of the Thessaloniki in God,

368
00:22:30.101 --> 00:22:32.740
the father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
Grace to you and peace.

369
00:22:33.130 --> 00:22:36.850
We always give thanks to God and then he goes on this long Thanksgiving about

370
00:22:36.851 --> 00:22:38.020
their faith,
blah,
blah,
blah,

371
00:22:38.050 --> 00:22:40.900
because our message of the Gospel came to you not only in word but also in the

372
00:22:40.901 --> 00:22:43.060
power of the Holy Spirit.
Full conviction.

373
00:22:43.061 --> 00:22:45.210
Just as you know what kind of persons we proved them wrong.

374
00:22:45.430 --> 00:22:49.500
You became imitators of us and of the Lord.
In spite of persecutions,

375
00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:52.840
you received the word with joints piper,
those Barrett,

376
00:22:53.050 --> 00:22:57.150
you became an example to all the believers in Macedonia and a Kia.

377
00:22:57.230 --> 00:23:01.480
A care refers then to the main part of Greece where Athens of course is,

378
00:23:01.481 --> 00:23:04.960
and corn the other for the word of the Lord had sounded forth from you,

379
00:23:04.961 --> 00:23:07.660
not only in Macedonia and a Kia,
but in every place.

380
00:23:07.661 --> 00:23:11.200
Your faith in God has become known so that we have no need to speak about it.

381
00:23:11.740 --> 00:23:14.380
So now here's the report that they're getting.
This has a few clues.

382
00:23:14.710 --> 00:23:19.710
For the people of those regions that is of Macedonian a Kia report about us.

383
00:23:21.010 --> 00:23:26.010
What kind of welcome we had among you and how you turned to God from idols to

384
00:23:28.631 --> 00:23:33.631
serve a living and true God and to wait for his son from heaven whom he raised

385
00:23:33.671 --> 00:23:37.480
from the dead.
Jesus who rescues us from the wrath that is coming.

386
00:23:39.130 --> 00:23:43.020
That basically sounds like a little nutshell of what Paul must have preached to

387
00:23:43.021 --> 00:23:47.210
them.
There's a wrath coming.
You're going to be distorting that wrath.

388
00:23:47.540 --> 00:23:52.540
You can be rescued from that wrath if you turned to this Guy Jesus did we tell

389
00:23:53.511 --> 00:23:58.511
you about who's the son of God and God raised him from the dead and you will

390
00:23:59.181 --> 00:24:01.370
wait for him to come from heaven and he'll rescue you.

391
00:24:02.150 --> 00:24:04.880
So that's kind of the nutshell of this message.

392
00:24:05.030 --> 00:24:07.520
But notice who is Paul talking to here?

393
00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:11.570
What kind of people were they before they became followers of Jesus?

394
00:24:12.950 --> 00:24:14.000
Where are the Jews?

395
00:24:16.600 --> 00:24:19.380
Is Paul talking to Jews?
This is not a trick question.

396
00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:20.580
It's right there in front of you.

397
00:24:21.810 --> 00:24:26.550
He's talking to gentiles because he says you turned from Gods to serve the

398
00:24:26.551 --> 00:24:29.730
living and true God.
So these are clearly gentiles he's addressing.

399
00:24:30.150 --> 00:24:34.110
So that's one clue about this is that Paul is addressing gentiles in First

400
00:24:34.111 --> 00:24:38.130
Thessalonians chapter two verse nine he gives us another little clue.

401
00:24:39.510 --> 00:24:43.050
You remember our labor and toil.

402
00:24:43.890 --> 00:24:48.090
Now my translation,
I'm using the new revised standard version and in order to,

403
00:24:48.091 --> 00:24:48.841
as I said before,

404
00:24:48.841 --> 00:24:52.620
in order to make this translation usable for liturgical use in churches,

405
00:24:52.860 --> 00:24:57.060
they've actually inclusive by some of the language.
So it says,
the Greek says,

406
00:24:57.090 --> 00:24:59.640
you remember our labor and toil brothers.

407
00:25:00.750 --> 00:25:02.760
My English translation says brothers and sisters,

408
00:25:03.150 --> 00:25:07.380
but the Greek just says auto Foy,
which means brothers.

409
00:25:07.410 --> 00:25:09.060
It can include women sometimes,

410
00:25:09.270 --> 00:25:13.200
so it's sorta like the word men and older English when it was supposed to

411
00:25:13.201 --> 00:25:17.400
include both women and men.
So the Greek Otto Foy can include women,

412
00:25:17.610 --> 00:25:21.300
but it's just the masculine Greek word brothers here that's in the text.

413
00:25:21.990 --> 00:25:23.280
That's not just a linguistic point.

414
00:25:23.281 --> 00:25:27.300
I'm going to return to that later because I'm going to argue that there's

415
00:25:27.301 --> 00:25:31.680
something important about this fact that Paul seems to address only men in first

416
00:25:31.681 --> 00:25:36.430
Thessalonians.
Do you remember our labor and taught brothers?

417
00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:40.480
We worked night and day so that we might not burden any of you while we proclaim

418
00:25:40.481 --> 00:25:41.710
to you the gospel of God,

419
00:25:42.040 --> 00:25:45.160
you are witnesses and God also so now one of the things to notice,

420
00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:46.420
notice what Paul is saying.

421
00:25:46.900 --> 00:25:49.750
He's saying that they themselves practice manual labor.

422
00:25:50.140 --> 00:25:53.200
One of the things that Paul wants to insist is that he,
he didn't,

423
00:25:53.230 --> 00:25:56.710
he and Silas and Timothy didn't live off handouts from the Thessaloniki.

424
00:25:57.490 --> 00:26:01.630
He's insisting we owned our re earned our own keep.
We practiced our own trade.

425
00:26:01.900 --> 00:26:04.570
What exactly was Paul's trade is again,

426
00:26:04.810 --> 00:26:06.970
acts calls him a leather worker or a tent maker.

427
00:26:07.330 --> 00:26:09.550
The word there in Greek is not exactly clear,

428
00:26:09.551 --> 00:26:13.300
but some people have said that if that acts account is true than Paul May have

429
00:26:13.301 --> 00:26:13.451
been.

430
00:26:13.451 --> 00:26:16.780
The kind of person there was not a lot of tents you made for city dwellers are

431
00:26:16.781 --> 00:26:20.830
some that they made awnings that would go these leather type in canvas awnings

432
00:26:20.831 --> 00:26:23.350
that would go in front of shops and everything's to keep the sun off.

433
00:26:23.560 --> 00:26:24.460
And they did make tense.

434
00:26:24.461 --> 00:26:27.760
So if that's true and you and Paul was a tent maker or a leather worker,

435
00:26:27.910 --> 00:26:31.090
that's the kind of thing he would have made.
But remember that's only an ax,

436
00:26:31.330 --> 00:26:34.990
but at least here we get a definite indication from his own letters that Paul

437
00:26:34.991 --> 00:26:37.690
was a manual laborer.
He worked with his hands.

438
00:26:38.950 --> 00:26:42.280
He doesn't tell us exactly in his letters what he did,
but he's holding,

439
00:26:42.550 --> 00:26:44.190
we did days we wouldn't burn you.

440
00:26:45.030 --> 00:26:48.600
You are witnesses and God also how pure upright and blameless our conduct was

441
00:26:48.690 --> 00:26:52.290
toward you.
Believers as you know,
we dealt with each one like a children,
blah,

442
00:26:52.291 --> 00:26:56.800
blah,
blah.
Oh say so.
So they,
they practice manual labor when they were there.

443
00:26:56.801 --> 00:27:01.801
And now look at Fort Verse 14 Chapter Two verse 14 for you brothers became

444
00:27:03.090 --> 00:27:08.090
imitators of the Churches of God in Christ Jesus that are in Judea there in

445
00:27:08.701 --> 00:27:11.100
Macedonia.
He's talking about the churches also in Judea,

446
00:27:11.790 --> 00:27:16.790
for you suffered the same things from your own compatriots as they did from the

447
00:27:17.461 --> 00:27:21.420
Jews who killed both the Lord Jesus and the prophets and drove us out that

448
00:27:21.421 --> 00:27:25.080
displeased God and oppose everyone by hindering us from speaking to the gentiles

449
00:27:25.081 --> 00:27:26.730
so that they may be saved.
Thus,

450
00:27:26.731 --> 00:27:28.680
they have constantly been filling up the measure of their sins,

451
00:27:28.860 --> 00:27:31.230
but God's wrath has overtaken them at last.

452
00:27:32.280 --> 00:27:35.820
Now what's going on here is at least that Paul is saying,

453
00:27:35.940 --> 00:27:37.920
you people in tests on like,
uh,

454
00:27:38.250 --> 00:27:42.690
you received persecution just like the followers of Jesus did in Judea,

455
00:27:43.260 --> 00:27:47.530
but who is persecuting these followers of Jesus in Thessaloniki?

456
00:27:49.820 --> 00:27:50.653
<v 2>Pardon</v>

457
00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:54.030
<v 0>compatriots?
In other words,
Greeks,</v>

458
00:27:54.780 --> 00:27:56.730
they're not being persecuted by Jews.

459
00:27:56.970 --> 00:27:59.010
They're being persecuted by their fellow Greeks.

460
00:28:00.900 --> 00:28:01.733
<v 2>So</v>

461
00:28:02.500 --> 00:28:06.130
<v 0>they're experiencing persecution to once they've decided to follow this Jewish</v>

462
00:28:06.131 --> 00:28:09.970
Messiah,
but they're not experiencing persecution from Jews,

463
00:28:10.030 --> 00:28:13.630
they're expensing it from Greeks.
Now you put all that together.

464
00:28:14.260 --> 00:28:19.260
There is no mention of Jews anywhere in First Thessalonians at all.

465
00:28:20.290 --> 00:28:20.831
In other words,

466
00:28:20.831 --> 00:28:25.831
is pretty clear that Paul is addressing a church that's composed of all

467
00:28:25.991 --> 00:28:26.824
gentiles.

468
00:28:28.120 --> 00:28:32.530
They became followers of Jesus by turning away from idols.
They weren't Jews.

469
00:28:32.860 --> 00:28:36.070
They're also experiencing persecution as the churches in Judea,

470
00:28:36.190 --> 00:28:38.230
but they don't experience persecution from Jews.

471
00:28:38.380 --> 00:28:41.650
They're experiencing persecution from gentiles,
their own neighbors.

472
00:28:42.250 --> 00:28:46.690
Now notice how this doesn't fit the narrative of acts.
According to acts,

473
00:28:46.691 --> 00:28:49.720
Paul goes first to the synagogue.
He preached to the Jews,

474
00:28:49.930 --> 00:28:53.950
some of them believe including leading women,
and he started,

475
00:28:53.980 --> 00:28:56.860
he saw he farms the nucleus of his group with Jews,

476
00:28:57.100 --> 00:29:01.300
and then he adds onto that nucleus.
Gentiles.
That doesn't seem to fit.

477
00:29:01.300 --> 00:29:03.760
First Thessalonians where there's no Jews mentioned at all.

478
00:29:03.910 --> 00:29:08.110
The only people he addresses are gentiles and he says they were persecuted not

479
00:29:08.111 --> 00:29:12.670
by Jews,
as is the case in ax,
but by gentiles.
So again,

480
00:29:12.850 --> 00:29:16.600
Paul's letters seem to provide a somewhat different picture.

481
00:29:16.810 --> 00:29:20.890
Then we got an ax and it's easy to see how ax told the story the way it did.

482
00:29:20.891 --> 00:29:24.340
Remember over and over the acts of the apostles presents Paul in the same

483
00:29:24.341 --> 00:29:27.160
pattern.
All the people in acts go to the Jews first.

484
00:29:27.161 --> 00:29:30.040
They preach in synagogues first city after city.

485
00:29:30.190 --> 00:29:33.130
They're rejected by the Jews or at least by most of them and then they go to the

486
00:29:33.131 --> 00:29:37.300
gentiles later,
so it's schematic in acts.
In first Thessalonians,

487
00:29:37.301 --> 00:29:39.010
we don't have a schematic history.

488
00:29:39.011 --> 00:29:41.200
We probably have a much better idea of what actually happened,

489
00:29:41.710 --> 00:29:45.790
which was that Paul founded this church with gentile believers and when they

490
00:29:45.791 --> 00:29:49.330
experienced persecution,
it wasn't from the Romans and it wasn't from Jews,

491
00:29:49.510 --> 00:29:52.810
it was from their neighbors so that we're going to come back to first

492
00:29:52.811 --> 00:29:53.644
Thessalonians,

493
00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:56.810
but that's just basically the set up that when we look at what's going on and

494
00:29:56.820 --> 00:29:57.653
pestle and Annika,

495
00:29:57.760 --> 00:30:02.140
we need to look at first Thessalonians and not depend upon acts again to tell us

496
00:30:02.141 --> 00:30:04.870
the story.
Any questions about that before I go on?

497
00:30:07.380 --> 00:30:09.300
Okay.
Other things about Paul?

498
00:30:10.170 --> 00:30:13.770
Paul has this many letters in the new testament.

499
00:30:15.750 --> 00:30:17.550
As you been reading in your textbook,

500
00:30:17.551 --> 00:30:22.080
you've already noticed that Bart Ehrman talks about the undisputed letters.

501
00:30:22.170 --> 00:30:25.290
There's just means.
These are the letters that almost all scholars will agree.

502
00:30:25.291 --> 00:30:30.291
Paul wrote the disputed letters that is letters that scholars disagree about.

503
00:30:33.240 --> 00:30:37.410
And then there are three letters that most scholars are agreed or not by Paul.

504
00:30:37.950 --> 00:30:42.060
So the undisputed letters are Romans first and second Corinthians,
Galatians,

505
00:30:42.061 --> 00:30:44.430
Philippians,
first Thessalonians and Phi Lehman.

506
00:30:45.330 --> 00:30:50.220
Most of us reject as being by uh,
uh,
later disciple of Paul,

507
00:30:50.520 --> 00:30:52.320
maybe even written in the second century.

508
00:30:52.560 --> 00:30:56.100
Some people believe these are decades after Paul's death that these letters were

509
00:30:56.101 --> 00:30:59.670
written a first and second Timothy and Titus.

510
00:30:59.790 --> 00:31:04.590
We also call these the pastoral epistles because they show Paul trying to teach

511
00:31:04.591 --> 00:31:07.530
Timothy and Titus how to be good pastors of a church.

512
00:31:07.830 --> 00:31:09.210
It's Paul giving instruction,

513
00:31:09.440 --> 00:31:12.120
so called Paul Given instruction to pastors of the church.

514
00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:14.460
Now these letters is a lot more debate about,

515
00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:18.060
I would say that I've ranked them here according to how,

516
00:31:18.150 --> 00:31:20.970
how likely some scholars believe they may have been written by Paul.

517
00:31:21.180 --> 00:31:24.480
More scholars will take from second Thessalonians is being by Paul.

518
00:31:25.110 --> 00:31:26.130
A lot of us doubted

519
00:31:27.630 --> 00:31:32.630
a few fewer scholars will take Colassians as being by Paul with more doubt on

520
00:31:32.971 --> 00:31:37.710
that.
And then Ephesians is a letter is a different letter written by a different

521
00:31:37.711 --> 00:31:40.050
person,
which use collagen's as a model.

522
00:31:40.470 --> 00:31:43.680
And more people believe that Ephesians is not by Paul.

523
00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:47.400
So in a rank of descending low probability,

524
00:31:47.700 --> 00:31:52.700
second Thessalonians collages in Ephesians are doubted as being truly by the

525
00:31:53.041 --> 00:31:53.874
Apostle Paul

526
00:31:59.320 --> 00:32:00.153
<v 1>the.</v>

527
00:32:00.830 --> 00:32:04.550
<v 0>So let's,
that's just to give you what's going on here just for a moment.</v>

528
00:32:04.551 --> 00:32:07.460
And let me back up also and tell you before we turned to some particular texts

529
00:32:07.461 --> 00:32:11.360
in First Thessalonians,
remember the lecture about the House Church.

530
00:32:11.810 --> 00:32:16.810
And remember I talked about the Roman household structure and the patron client

531
00:32:16.821 --> 00:32:19.340
structure.
Now this will be very important,

532
00:32:19.370 --> 00:32:22.070
especially for your discussions as we come find Lehman.

533
00:32:22.550 --> 00:32:27.230
Remember that the Roman household is a pyramid kind of structure with the potter

534
00:32:27.231 --> 00:32:31.820
Familias,
the Roman head of the household at the top and that person's,
uh,

535
00:32:31.880 --> 00:32:36.880
sons and daughters being next in the level the person's slaves in the household

536
00:32:37.221 --> 00:32:38.480
being at the very bottom level,

537
00:32:38.780 --> 00:32:41.840
but then above the slaves and below the sons and the daughters,

538
00:32:42.050 --> 00:32:46.340
you've got people like freed persons of the householder who are,

539
00:32:46.640 --> 00:32:49.070
who are become then the householders clients.

540
00:32:49.670 --> 00:32:54.410
The clients give honor to their patron and the patron gives financial security

541
00:32:54.560 --> 00:32:57.800
and sometimes legal help or other kinds of help,
social help,

542
00:32:57.890 --> 00:32:59.810
social connections to the client.

543
00:33:00.530 --> 00:33:03.230
And you might even have free people,

544
00:33:03.740 --> 00:33:07.280
free men and women who have connected to different households even if they're

545
00:33:07.281 --> 00:33:11.360
not connected legally.
Because in Roman law,
a freed slave,

546
00:33:11.361 --> 00:33:16.190
the Friedman was even legally a client of the patron still owed legal duties to

547
00:33:16.191 --> 00:33:17.024
the patron.

548
00:33:17.240 --> 00:33:21.950
So it wasn't like the person who was freed became entirely free and footloose

549
00:33:21.951 --> 00:33:25.070
and happy away from the household.
They still had connections,

550
00:33:25.071 --> 00:33:28.100
both legal connections,
but apart from the League of requirements,

551
00:33:28.220 --> 00:33:32.810
you would have even other nonlegal clients become like clients of a household.

552
00:33:33.230 --> 00:33:37.040
That's we're going to see how different Char House churches start constructing

553
00:33:37.041 --> 00:33:37.874
themselves.

554
00:33:38.060 --> 00:33:43.060
Paul and his letters will repeatedly then address certain people by name and

555
00:33:43.581 --> 00:33:44.840
greet them and he'll say,

556
00:33:44.870 --> 00:33:48.260
and the church that meets in your house are in their house.

557
00:33:48.950 --> 00:33:53.660
That's setting up that idea that the people he's named are kind of considered

558
00:33:53.661 --> 00:33:57.050
the patrons,
the Potter Familia of the House Church.

559
00:33:57.380 --> 00:34:00.080
And then the House Church has this patron client structure.

560
00:34:00.410 --> 00:34:04.070
So keep that in mind when what we talk about this.

561
00:34:04.160 --> 00:34:05.600
So now let's back up again and say now,

562
00:34:05.601 --> 00:34:08.660
so what did Paul have to teach to the Thessaloniki?

563
00:34:08.661 --> 00:34:13.661
Ans first he talked them mainly to turn from idol worship and polytheism.

564
00:34:14.780 --> 00:34:18.350
Now this is hard for us to think about tape today because you don't go around to

565
00:34:18.351 --> 00:34:22.940
almost any church and they have an altar call.
We had lots of altar calls.

566
00:34:22.941 --> 00:34:23.571
My church,
you know,

567
00:34:23.571 --> 00:34:27.440
they had songs at the end just as I am sung with like 75 different verses.

568
00:34:27.740 --> 00:34:30.140
And they're trying to get you to come down to confess Jesus as your Lord and

569
00:34:30.141 --> 00:34:34.190
Personal Savior and be prayed for and maybe be bad ties.
And you know,

570
00:34:34.191 --> 00:34:37.760
they keep seeing the invitation song until you finally feel guilty enough that

571
00:34:37.761 --> 00:34:41.180
you come down front for the altar call.
And yes,
the buses will wait.

572
00:34:41.210 --> 00:34:45.860
The buses will wait,
come on down.
And almost no situation like that.

573
00:34:45.870 --> 00:34:50.870
Are they saying you need to turn from stop worshiping Zeus and Apollo and

574
00:34:51.411 --> 00:34:53.750
Artemis and turn to the living and True God?

575
00:34:55.010 --> 00:34:57.650
Our Gospels today have other kinds of messages,

576
00:34:57.830 --> 00:35:01.490
but apparently the most fundamental message that Paul was telling people when

577
00:35:01.491 --> 00:35:05.360
you went around to these Greek cities was idols are not gods.

578
00:35:05.480 --> 00:35:09.230
You need to stop worshiping these stones and rocks and things and start

579
00:35:09.231 --> 00:35:10.460
worshiping the god of Israel.

580
00:35:10.461 --> 00:35:13.580
The God of Israel is the only true God is the only living God.

581
00:35:13.730 --> 00:35:15.380
All the rest of these are dead gods.

582
00:35:15.740 --> 00:35:19.430
So that's the main thing that Paul seems had been teaching as he quotes,

583
00:35:19.431 --> 00:35:22.160
they're in first Thessalonians.
Like I said,

584
00:35:22.190 --> 00:35:25.400
he's teaching them to accept the god of Israel as their God.

585
00:35:26.930 --> 00:35:31.930
He's teaching them to accept the kingship of Jesus Christ as God's son and the

586
00:35:32.601 --> 00:35:33.440
Jewish Messiah,

587
00:35:34.580 --> 00:35:39.580
to await the salvation of Jesus to come from heaven in the near future.

588
00:35:39.660 --> 00:35:40.493
So yes,

589
00:35:40.590 --> 00:35:44.190
Jesus is going to swoop down from heaven and Paul expecting this very soon.

590
00:35:44.790 --> 00:35:47.760
And then to avoid certain gentile behaviors and he'd kind of,

591
00:35:47.761 --> 00:35:50.790
we'll list sometimes things he calls gentile behaviors.

592
00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:55.140
One of the most important of those gentile behaviors was sexual immorality,

593
00:35:55.350 --> 00:35:59.370
or in the Greek,
simply the word [inaudible],
where we get the word pornography.

594
00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:07.620
This is very difficult to translate into English because it could be used in

595
00:36:07.621 --> 00:36:09.390
Greek simply for sexual intercourse.

596
00:36:10.380 --> 00:36:14.010
A poor also was used for a prostitute,
but it,

597
00:36:14.250 --> 00:36:19.200
but it didn't mean necessarily someone who sold a porn ages was a sex person,

598
00:36:19.710 --> 00:36:24.570
a sexy woman,
or a sex man.
So porn,
a pornhub meant really basically just sex.

599
00:36:24.870 --> 00:36:26.730
But June two Jews at the time,

600
00:36:26.850 --> 00:36:31.590
it came to represent every aspect of sexuality that they believed were wrong and

601
00:36:31.591 --> 00:36:34.560
that only gentiles did,
but they included a lot of things in this.

602
00:36:34.710 --> 00:36:37.350
So adultery would be included in Porneia,

603
00:36:37.500 --> 00:36:40.200
all kinds of having sex with anybody else,

604
00:36:40.201 --> 00:36:43.610
but your married partner would be considered porneia masturbation.

605
00:36:43.660 --> 00:36:48.390
It could be considered Porneia.
Homosexuality could be considered Porneia.
Uh,

606
00:36:48.391 --> 00:36:53.391
having the woman on top with a man could be considered Porneia if the woman uses

607
00:36:53.401 --> 00:36:57.750
a Dildo or something to penetrate the man that could also be pornea any kind of

608
00:36:57.751 --> 00:37:00.600
oral sex,
whether it was homosexual or heterosexual,

609
00:37:00.630 --> 00:37:03.150
any oral sex was considered Porneia by the Jews.

610
00:37:03.420 --> 00:37:08.420
So porneia was as any list of things that Jews believed shouldn't be done and

611
00:37:08.911 --> 00:37:10.530
that gentiles typically did.

612
00:37:11.640 --> 00:37:14.130
And that's one of the thing Paul is very much against.

613
00:37:14.460 --> 00:37:17.520
And he talks about that in one place.
Look in first Thessalonians four.

614
00:37:18.390 --> 00:37:19.680
Now remember he's addressing here,

615
00:37:19.860 --> 00:37:23.610
men who used to be Greeks and who thought,

616
00:37:23.611 --> 00:37:26.610
who probably thought nothing at all about having sex with lots of different

617
00:37:26.611 --> 00:37:29.490
people.
I mean,
you know,
the Greeks didn't seem to have many.

618
00:37:29.640 --> 00:37:32.520
Of course women weren't supposed to have sex with me because the woman was the

619
00:37:32.521 --> 00:37:33.600
possession of the man,

620
00:37:34.080 --> 00:37:38.250
but they didn't care about men having sex with prostitutes or other men or other

621
00:37:38.251 --> 00:37:41.070
women.
You know there when danger in that.

622
00:37:41.370 --> 00:37:45.000
So he's talking to people who this was their idea of sex was that it's not that

623
00:37:45.001 --> 00:37:49.980
big a deal for one.
Finally brothers,
and he's not saying sisters here,

624
00:37:49.981 --> 00:37:54.270
the word his brothers,
and you'll see why as he goes on,
we ask an urge,

625
00:37:54.271 --> 00:37:55.110
you in the Lord Jesus,

626
00:37:55.111 --> 00:37:58.560
that as you learn from us how you ought to live and to please God as you are

627
00:37:58.561 --> 00:37:58.980
doing,

628
00:37:58.980 --> 00:38:01.980
we do so more and more for you know what instructions we gave you through the

629
00:38:01.981 --> 00:38:03.960
Lord Jesus for this is the will of God.

630
00:38:03.960 --> 00:38:07.560
Your sanctification that you abstain from Porneia.

631
00:38:07.650 --> 00:38:09.780
It's translated in your texts maybe is fornication.

632
00:38:09.880 --> 00:38:14.430
You just means any kind of immoral sex that each of you know how to control your

633
00:38:14.431 --> 00:38:18.150
own vessel is the actual Greek and maybe translate his body,

634
00:38:18.510 --> 00:38:19.440
but it means vessel.

635
00:38:19.470 --> 00:38:22.590
So there's a debate among scholars is just talking about control your own body.

636
00:38:22.591 --> 00:38:26.970
As a man or to control your woman,
who's the vessel for your sexual overflow.

637
00:38:27.030 --> 00:38:31.590
Overflow in holding this and honor,
not with lustful passion,

638
00:38:31.620 --> 00:38:36.620
not with desire like the gentiles who do not know God.

639
00:38:36.940 --> 00:38:40.900
See Desire,
sexual desire and passion are linkedin.

640
00:38:40.901 --> 00:38:43.090
Paul's mind only to the gentile world,

641
00:38:43.750 --> 00:38:48.750
not the body of Christ that no one wrong or exploit a brother in this matter or

642
00:38:49.870 --> 00:38:54.010
sister is not in the text.
You don't expect your book,

643
00:38:54.130 --> 00:38:56.050
and the reason that makes them minimums is ancient.

644
00:38:56.051 --> 00:39:01.051
People never thought about defrauding a woman by having sex with her husband.

645
00:39:02.770 --> 00:39:03.880
They just didn't think that way,

646
00:39:04.150 --> 00:39:09.150
but because the woman was the receptacle for the sexuality of the man and she

647
00:39:09.191 --> 00:39:12.400
was polluted by having sex with any man except her husband,

648
00:39:12.850 --> 00:39:17.320
to have sex with another man's woman was depriving that man of his property

649
00:39:17.321 --> 00:39:21.940
rights.
So it made no sense to have it defrauding the woman here,
the sister.

650
00:39:22.180 --> 00:39:25.150
It made perfect sense in Paul's mind to talk about defrauding the brother

651
00:39:26.170 --> 00:39:28.960
because the Lord has eventually all these things for God.

652
00:39:28.961 --> 00:39:31.000
Did Not call you to impurity,
but wholeness.
Therefore,

653
00:39:31.001 --> 00:39:33.880
whoever rejects this rejects not human floated.
But God gives us the Holy Spirit.

654
00:39:33.970 --> 00:39:37.390
Notice what Paul is doing.
Paula,
just like almost anybody else of his society.

655
00:39:37.540 --> 00:39:42.280
He's talking to men here and he says,
you guys,
now you're in this new church,

656
00:39:42.281 --> 00:39:44.980
this new community.
This is different from the way you used to live.

657
00:39:45.640 --> 00:39:50.290
So you guys have your own mate and do what you need to do with her.

658
00:39:51.130 --> 00:39:53.050
You know,
just control yourself.
Do what you need to do with her.

659
00:39:53.410 --> 00:39:57.250
Don't go after the woman of your Christian brother.

660
00:39:57.910 --> 00:40:01.900
Why?
Notice he says nothing about any concern for the woman.
There's he did,

661
00:40:01.910 --> 00:40:05.620
at least in this text,
he shows no concerns for the woman's interest.

662
00:40:05.621 --> 00:40:08.620
What he says is if you have sex with another man's woman,

663
00:40:08.740 --> 00:40:12.580
you will be defrauding your brother.
You're robbing your brother of his right.

664
00:40:13.900 --> 00:40:18.900
So that's shows this very traditional Jewish sense about Porneia sexuality that

665
00:40:20.021 --> 00:40:20.830
Paul is expressing.

666
00:40:20.830 --> 00:40:25.120
And you can see why he needs to say this because he's addressing this group of

667
00:40:25.121 --> 00:40:28.420
guys who had all been Greeks now,
but what does he also say?

668
00:40:28.570 --> 00:40:32.110
Look at for uh,
let's see,
five one through 11.

669
00:40:33.660 --> 00:40:34.540
This is something else.

670
00:40:34.541 --> 00:40:37.510
He seems to need to clear up with them concerning the times and seasons.

671
00:40:37.511 --> 00:40:40.360
Brothers and sisters,
you do not need to have anything written to you.

672
00:40:40.360 --> 00:40:43.390
For you yourselves know very well that the day of the Lord will come like a

673
00:40:43.391 --> 00:40:46.630
thief in the night when they say there is peace and security,

674
00:40:46.840 --> 00:40:51.460
then sudden destruction will come upon them as labor pains come upon a pregnant

675
00:40:51.461 --> 00:40:52.990
woman,
there will be no escape.

676
00:40:53.020 --> 00:40:55.980
He's talking about that Jesus coming on the clouds of heaven.

677
00:40:56.050 --> 00:40:59.170
Now he's getting to what he did.
He alluded to it the first.

678
00:40:59.171 --> 00:41:00.790
Now he's telling you how it's going to happen.

679
00:41:00.880 --> 00:41:04.420
This is how it's going to happen and he's telling them,
you don't need to be.

680
00:41:04.450 --> 00:41:08.320
He's reminding us of this,
right?
He already said,
you don't need to be told this.

681
00:41:08.321 --> 00:41:12.100
I'm reminding of stuff you already know.
So this is stuff he's told them

682
00:41:13.690 --> 00:41:16.630
but you believe it or not in darkness for that date as surprised you like a

683
00:41:16.631 --> 00:41:16.930
thief.

684
00:41:16.930 --> 00:41:20.200
You are all children of light and none of the day we are not of the night is a

685
00:41:20.201 --> 00:41:22.960
darkness.
So let us not fall asleep as others do.
Others do.

686
00:41:22.961 --> 00:41:26.020
But let us keep awake and be sober for those who sleep,
sleep at night,

687
00:41:26.200 --> 00:41:29.830
those who are drunk get drunk at night,
but we belong to the day.
In other words,

688
00:41:29.831 --> 00:41:34.230
he says basically stay awake.
Stay.
It's going to happen.

689
00:41:34.260 --> 00:41:37.740
You don't know when.
Just be ready.
But why does he remind them of that?

690
00:41:37.890 --> 00:41:42.890
Let's look back for 13 this is after he's talked about Porneia for 13 but we do

691
00:41:45.301 --> 00:41:47.730
not want you to be uninformed brothers.

692
00:41:48.570 --> 00:41:50.730
This is an art I grew up in that the King James version says,

693
00:41:50.940 --> 00:41:52.950
we would not have you ignorant brothers,

694
00:41:53.220 --> 00:41:56.730
which the men in my church like to say we wouldn't have you ignorant brothers

695
00:41:58.320 --> 00:42:01.470
about those who have died.
Now notice now he's sending them something new.

696
00:42:01.590 --> 00:42:05.040
This is not stuff they already know.
He's,
this is new material,

697
00:42:05.340 --> 00:42:07.020
so this is not stuff he's preached them before.

698
00:42:07.630 --> 00:42:08.463
<v 1>Okay,</v>

699
00:42:08.560 --> 00:42:11.410
<v 0>so that you may not grieve as others who do not have hope.</v>

700
00:42:11.650 --> 00:42:14.800
What he's telling them.
Don't grieve.
People in the church seemed to have died.

701
00:42:15.430 --> 00:42:17.740
He says,
don't grieve.
Don't greet first.

702
00:42:17.741 --> 00:42:21.100
Since we believe that Jesus died and rose again,
even so through Jesus,

703
00:42:21.280 --> 00:42:25.270
God will bring with him those who have died for this,

704
00:42:25.271 --> 00:42:28.690
we declare it to you by the word of the Lord that we who are alive,

705
00:42:28.960 --> 00:42:31.030
who are left until the coming of the Lord.

706
00:42:31.210 --> 00:42:34.990
So Paul believes that he probably will still be alive when Jesus comes back.

707
00:42:35.650 --> 00:42:40.630
Will by no means precede those who have died for the Lord himself with a cry of

708
00:42:40.631 --> 00:42:42.130
command,
with the archangels.

709
00:42:42.131 --> 00:42:45.040
Call with the sound of God's trumpet will descend from heaven.

710
00:42:45.190 --> 00:42:49.810
The dead in Christ will rise first.
This is not something he's told him before.

711
00:42:49.811 --> 00:42:52.390
Seeing then we who are alive,

712
00:42:52.391 --> 00:42:55.210
who are left will be caught up in the clouds together with them to meet the Lord

713
00:42:55.211 --> 00:42:58.270
in the air and so we will be the wee bits,
the lord forever.

714
00:42:58.360 --> 00:43:00.550
Therefore encourage one another with these words.

715
00:43:00.670 --> 00:43:02.200
This is pretty astounding to me.

716
00:43:04.300 --> 00:43:09.300
These people did not know what happened to dead people in Christ.

717
00:43:10.450 --> 00:43:10.850
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

718
00:43:10.850 --> 00:43:12.950
<v 0>Paul hadn't told them that when he preached to them.</v>

719
00:43:13.900 --> 00:43:14.540
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

720
00:43:14.540 --> 00:43:17.450
<v 0>In Modern Christianity,
in fact,
a lot of modern religion in the west,</v>

721
00:43:17.750 --> 00:43:22.700
we tend to think one of the main things people become religious four is to live

722
00:43:22.701 --> 00:43:26.540
forever.
Life after death to go to heaven.

723
00:43:27.590 --> 00:43:32.060
What modern p Christians think salvation is his salvation from death or

724
00:43:32.061 --> 00:43:34.820
salvation from hell.
Paul,

725
00:43:34.850 --> 00:43:39.050
these people converted to this new group without having been told any of that.

726
00:43:39.950 --> 00:43:43.400
What seems to have happened is that Paul converted them because he said,

727
00:43:43.401 --> 00:43:47.750
Jesus will save you from this big apocalyptic coming wrath of God that's coming

728
00:43:47.751 --> 00:43:51.410
upon the whole world,
so convert come to Jesus and he'll save you from that.

729
00:43:51.411 --> 00:43:52.820
He'll rescue from that rep,

730
00:43:53.540 --> 00:43:56.600
but what they seem to have thought was that while they were still living any

731
00:43:56.601 --> 00:43:58.130
week now,
Jesus would come down,

732
00:43:58.370 --> 00:44:02.810
he would destroy the evil people and he would set up the Kingdom of God on earth

733
00:44:02.930 --> 00:44:06.110
and we'd have a new kingdom,
a new Ian that would last forever.

734
00:44:06.140 --> 00:44:08.660
God would be ever over everything.
Jesus would be the king of the earth,

735
00:44:08.900 --> 00:44:11.330
but it's not like it's going to happen in a thousand years from now.

736
00:44:11.380 --> 00:44:13.010
They were all expecting to happen right now.

737
00:44:13.130 --> 00:44:17.930
What they converted to was to escape the wrath and to live on into that kingdom.

738
00:44:18.620 --> 00:44:23.620
They weren't expecting anybody to die and somebody in their community dies and

739
00:44:23.631 --> 00:44:27.440
they go,
what?
Mary just died?

740
00:44:28.160 --> 00:44:29.690
She's going to miss out on the party.

741
00:44:31.140 --> 00:44:33.450
She's not going to get partake in the Pero CEO,

742
00:44:33.451 --> 00:44:35.520
which is this Greek word that means the coming,
the appearing,

743
00:44:35.521 --> 00:44:38.520
the presence of Jesus is the word here for the coming of Jesus,

744
00:44:38.700 --> 00:44:40.080
the Pero Si of Jesus.

745
00:44:40.081 --> 00:44:43.120
She's not able to participate because she died and Paul says,
way Babu had,

746
00:44:43.170 --> 00:44:44.100
I forgot to tell you something.

747
00:44:46.560 --> 00:44:49.890
You know that there will be people to die.
Don't grieve.
Now.

748
00:44:49.891 --> 00:44:51.540
That's pretty radical thing in the ancient world.

749
00:44:51.541 --> 00:44:53.940
You just don't go around telling people,
don't grieve over your dead.

750
00:44:54.150 --> 00:44:57.720
Grieving is a big deal for everybody.
You're supposed to agree,
right?

751
00:44:57.980 --> 00:45:02.760
Paul is so radical.
He tells him not to grieve and he says,
don't grieve because

752
00:45:04.530 --> 00:45:07.890
if Mary is,
Mary's died.
But when Jesus comes back,

753
00:45:08.790 --> 00:45:12.330
before we all get swooped up into the air to be with him,

754
00:45:12.870 --> 00:45:15.720
the grays wall open,
the dead in Christ will rise up.

755
00:45:15.750 --> 00:45:19.560
They'll all fly up in the air,
they'll meet Jesus in the air,

756
00:45:20.550 --> 00:45:21.720
and then we'll fly up in the air.

757
00:45:21.721 --> 00:45:24.720
We'll meet Jesus in the air and then we'll all come back down here and have the

758
00:45:24.720 --> 00:45:29.280
Kingdom of God.
So don't worry,
the dead people won't miss out on anything.

759
00:45:30.540 --> 00:45:35.540
But now isn't that curious that Paul has to fill in this big gap

760
00:45:37.770 --> 00:45:38.670
in their knowledge,

761
00:45:40.080 --> 00:45:44.490
the very thing that most of us modern people think you become a Christian for,

762
00:45:44.910 --> 00:45:47.160
which is,
I don't know,

763
00:45:47.520 --> 00:45:51.780
immortal life or the immortality of the soul or life after death,

764
00:45:52.620 --> 00:45:54.690
the Thessaloniki is didn't know anything about.

765
00:45:55.440 --> 00:45:57.480
They did some notes thinking about eternal life,
I think.

766
00:45:57.481 --> 00:46:00.900
But I think what they thought was that if you are still living when Jesus came

767
00:46:00.901 --> 00:46:02.550
back,
then you'd get to live forever.

768
00:46:03.660 --> 00:46:07.170
But they were upset because people in their community had died and they didn't

769
00:46:07.171 --> 00:46:08.460
know what was going to happen to them.

770
00:46:09.300 --> 00:46:12.450
So Paul tells them this bit of information.
In other words,

771
00:46:12.451 --> 00:46:16.980
what Paul had first told them was what would happen to them to,
to them.

772
00:46:17.010 --> 00:46:20.640
When Jesus came back,
they would be saved from the wrath of God.

773
00:46:21.960 --> 00:46:24.300
Now Paul has to write to them to say,
no,

774
00:46:24.301 --> 00:46:28.110
don't worry if people in your community die because it's also going to happen.

775
00:46:28.320 --> 00:46:30.480
But they won't get left out either.

776
00:46:31.530 --> 00:46:36.530
And it gives us a very interesting sense of what kind of group this was,

777
00:46:37.920 --> 00:46:41.730
that they didn't know something about Christianity,

778
00:46:41.731 --> 00:46:44.940
the resurrection of Christians at the end of time.

779
00:46:45.780 --> 00:46:49.260
This so much part of the creeds,
part of modern faith,

780
00:46:49.261 --> 00:46:52.860
part of faith is the last few thousand years and these early converts to this

781
00:46:52.861 --> 00:46:56.250
group didn't seem to know it.
So what kind of group is this?

782
00:46:56.370 --> 00:46:59.400
Now I want to go back to the fact that I said over and over again,

783
00:47:00.120 --> 00:47:03.690
Paul never addresses any women in this letter.

784
00:47:04.710 --> 00:47:07.530
Now that it's not because he doesn't address women and other letters and other

785
00:47:07.531 --> 00:47:12.090
letters.
Paul does talk to women even by name.
He talks about women's problems.

786
00:47:12.480 --> 00:47:15.630
If you look in First Corinthians and we will,
we will when we get there.

787
00:47:15.900 --> 00:47:20.900
Paul brings up this issue of sexual immorality again and there he talks to the

788
00:47:21.361 --> 00:47:26.250
husbands and says,
you husbands,
don't go fill around with somebody else's wife.

789
00:47:26.670 --> 00:47:30.520
But he also talks to the wives.
In other words,
Paul and other places,

790
00:47:30.521 --> 00:47:34.750
when he talks to husbands,
he talks to wives also.
When he talks to men,

791
00:47:34.870 --> 00:47:39.820
he talks to women.
He addresses women's problems in different letters,

792
00:47:40.120 --> 00:47:41.470
but in first Thessalonians,

793
00:47:41.620 --> 00:47:46.620
he never talks to a woman at all and he only talks about women when he's talking

794
00:47:47.951 --> 00:47:52.850
about men trying to get to them con to control themselves sexually and what he

795
00:47:52.851 --> 00:47:56.510
says to them is control your own thing.
Guys,

796
00:47:57.290 --> 00:48:01.520
the Greek word translated body or vessel also means thing.

797
00:48:01.700 --> 00:48:05.570
Screw us.
That's what Paul uses.
Their control,
your thing,

798
00:48:06.470 --> 00:48:08.420
not as thing referred to his body,

799
00:48:08.960 --> 00:48:11.540
his wife's body or as Genitalia.

800
00:48:12.140 --> 00:48:16.670
It's anybody's guess and different interpreters disagree about how they would

801
00:48:16.671 --> 00:48:17.504
want to translate it.

802
00:48:17.810 --> 00:48:22.810
But what it certainly shows is that Paul's addressing a group of men and one

803
00:48:23.271 --> 00:48:26.990
scholar [inaudible] Copenhagen has written an article where she says,

804
00:48:27.050 --> 00:48:30.530
we've got to take this seriously at at least at this stage in Paul's career,

805
00:48:30.590 --> 00:48:35.510
maybe he really did see these groups as being primarily male clubs.

806
00:48:35.870 --> 00:48:37.670
Sure,
they may have had women,
you know,

807
00:48:37.760 --> 00:48:40.370
and daughters and wives as part of them in a way.

808
00:48:40.850 --> 00:48:45.110
But maybe in Paul's conception,
these things were sort of like fraternities,

809
00:48:45.880 --> 00:48:47.410
the fraternity of Jesus.

810
00:48:48.310 --> 00:48:52.210
And that's why he addresses only men and he doesn't talk about women.

811
00:48:53.440 --> 00:48:55.210
And that's why when he's talking about,

812
00:48:55.360 --> 00:48:59.290
and these are a fraternity that seem not to the expected,

813
00:48:59.920 --> 00:49:02.800
the resurrection and all this other kind of stuff.
So Paul writes verse,

814
00:49:02.801 --> 00:49:04.900
let's Odians to clue them in on it.

815
00:49:06.490 --> 00:49:11.380
So what this would be would be a male club of Greek speaking,

816
00:49:11.770 --> 00:49:13.930
gentile,
manual laborers.

817
00:49:15.410 --> 00:49:20.410
They've now been initiated into a new group that demands adherence and loyalty

818
00:49:22.430 --> 00:49:27.420
to the God of the Jews and unexpected Jewish Messiah.

819
00:49:28.710 --> 00:49:29.221
In other words,

820
00:49:29.221 --> 00:49:34.221
this is an apocalyptic Jewish sect of gentiles.

821
00:49:38.800 --> 00:49:41.170
Now we'll see after spring break.

822
00:49:42.030 --> 00:49:42.430
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

823
00:49:42.430 --> 00:49:45.820
<v 0>How some of Paul's other letters show that his churches,</v>

824
00:49:45.910 --> 00:49:50.110
if they started off like that,
they became a lot more complex later.

825
00:49:51.800 --> 00:49:55.100
See you after spring break have you'll be talking about file Lehman.

826
00:49:55.670 --> 00:49:58.700
A lot of the stuff we talked about today,
how's churches?

827
00:49:59.240 --> 00:50:03.800
That sort of stuff may be important for your discussion groups.
This,
oh,

828
00:50:03.801 --> 00:50:08.090
not this week,
right?
You're doing that next.
Next time we have class.

829
00:50:09.080 --> 00:50:11.330
That's right.
This is not spring break.
Oh good.
We're good.

830
00:50:11.331 --> 00:50:12.470
We can cover all this next time.
