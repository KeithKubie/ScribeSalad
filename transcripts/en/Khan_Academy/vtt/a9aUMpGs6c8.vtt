00:00:00.564 --> 00:00:01.980
In the last few
videos, we've been

00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:04.120
talking about the
production possibilities

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:06.290
frontier as a relatively
static thing, something

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:08.552
that you couldn't change
but you could move along.

00:00:08.552 --> 00:00:10.510
What I want to do in this
video is think about,

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:13.710
maybe there are ways
to change or expand

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.690
the production
possibilities frontier.

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:19.720
And to do that let's assume that
our little hunter-gatherer has

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:21.710
decided to become
a strict carnivore.

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:24.310
So he's only focused
on rabbits now.

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:28.070
And his whole happiness in
life is optimizing the number

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:31.500
of rabbits he can catch
and eat in a given day.

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.650
And so let's-- on
one axis let's draw,

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:38.750
let's say the number of rabbits
that he can catch in a given

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:39.550
day.

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:46.200
Let's say it's 1,
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7--

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.660
I could keep going on and on.

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:51.810
So this right over
here is rabbits

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:55.910
that he can catch in a
given day, rabbits in a day.

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:57.920
But remember, he wants
to optimize this.

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.490
He wants to think about how he
can increase his productivity

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:03.210
in terms of the
number of rabbits.

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.010
And he knows-- we'll
just assume that he

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.005
knows how to build rabbit traps.

00:01:07.005 --> 00:01:09.130
So now we're going to do
a production possibilities

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:11.270
frontier, not between
rabbits and berries,

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:16.630
but between rabbits and building
rabbit traps, so rabbit traps.

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:22.250
So maybe he's able
to get twigs together

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:23.410
and he builds something.

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:25.920
Puts the twigs together
in a little thing.

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.990
It's a little box that--
maybe he puts a little,

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:31.620
I don't know some type of
carrot down over there.

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:34.920
And then if the rabbit comes
then takes the carrot then

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.270
the box falls on the rabbit
or something like that.

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:41.070
We don't have to go into the
particulars of the actual trap.

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.720
But he can also spends his
time building rabbit traps.

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.990
So let's say, 1 rabbit
trap, 2 rabbit traps,

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.430
and 3 rabbit traps.

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:54.320
And let's say-- we're going to
hold all other things equal,

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:55.950
ceteris parabus.

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.680
So we're not worrying
about other things.

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.320
And as we'll see, in most
introductory economics class,

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.060
whenever you do a production
possibilities frontier

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.900
you're only doing it
with two dimensions.

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:06.820
And so that's why you
have a regular curve.

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:08.560
You could have one with three
dimensions, where you're

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:10.509
doing the trade off
between three things.

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:13.450
But then you would have to
have a three dimensional graph,

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.940
and essentially the production
possibilities frontier

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:17.220
would be a surface.

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.520
But let's just focus
on this right now.

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:22.340
Maybe I'll do a surface in
the future, just for fun.

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.300
So these are the rabbit traps.

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.030
And let's say the production
possibilities frontier

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.180
between rabbit traps and rabbits
look something like this.

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.610
He could spend all his
time making rabbit traps,

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:35.520
but in that case he
won't get any rabbits

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:36.640
and he'll probably starve.

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.770
And that wouldn't
be a good scenario.

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:41.540
Or he could spend all of
this time hunting for rabbits

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:44.840
and he would catch, on
average, 5 rabbits per day.

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.630
But that would leave him no
time to make rabbit traps.

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:49.910
So this is our
current production

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:54.770
possibilities-- let
me just draw it.

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:58.970
This is our current production
possibilities frontier.

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:03.350
So I'll call this p, production
possibilities frontier.

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:06.330
And I'll put a little
0 subscript there.

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:07.810
That's our starting point.

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:09.875
So he can he can sit
anywhere over here,

00:03:09.875 --> 00:03:12.250
and he would have achieved
productive efficiency anywhere

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:13.510
on this curve.

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:18.360
But as we saw, if he just spent
all of his time doing this

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.790
over here, he'll never
get any rabbit traps.

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:22.170
And so he won't
be able to change

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:25.140
the productive
possibility frontier.

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:27.550
But what happens if
instead he decides

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:29.590
that he does want to
build some rabbit traps?

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:32.780
So he decreases the number
of rabbits a day to 4

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:36.780
and that allows him to
make 1 rabbit trap per day.

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:39.620
So he wants to hang
out in this scenario.

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:41.400
So every day that
goes by, on average,

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:42.920
he's going to make 4 rabbits.

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:45.880
And he's going to
build a rabbit trap.

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:47.380
So what's going to happen?

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:50.420
So as we go into, maybe
into the next period,

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:54.470
he would now have a rabbit
trap after just one day

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:56.830
that he can use to
help catch rabbits.

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:00.150
So that will actually change
the production possibilities

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:01.460
frontier.

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:03.530
So if he makes
this investment, it

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:06.620
will actually allow him,
in a given amount of time,

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:08.880
to actually catch more rabbits.

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:11.000
So if he does that, the
production possibilities

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.180
frontier-- having a rabbit
trap won't make him that much,

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:16.890
won't allow him to make
more rabbit traps in a day.

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:19.630
So the most rabbit traps
he can make in a day

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:21.339
is still going to be 3.

00:04:21.339 --> 00:04:24.450
But maybe now he can
catch 6 rabbits a day.

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:30.210
So now it might look
something like that.

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:32.380
So now he could either
stop making rabbit traps,

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:35.020
and catch 6 a day just
with that 1 rabbit trap

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:37.840
he has, or he could
continue that.

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:39.980
And now actually he can
catch 5 rabbits a day

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:42.130
and still make 1
rabbit trap a day.

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:43.600
And maybe he decides to do that.

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:46.130
But it could be anywhere along
this production possibilities

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:47.830
frontier.

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:51.400
Or he could say, hey, I'm happy
eating the 4 rabbits a day.

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:54.660
I'm going to make 2 rabbit
traps now every day.

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:57.520
And now after another period
he gets even more productive.

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:01.900
And so then the production--
so let me call this one,

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:02.890
this is after one day.

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:07.130
Production possibilities
frontier after one day,

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:08.770
and then after two
days, let's say

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:10.860
he did this scenario
right over here.

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:12.670
Now he's produce 2 rabbit traps.

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:15.010
And obviously, maybe I'm
exaggerating how quickly

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:16.580
his productivity would grow.

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:19.970
But maybe now the new production
possibilities frontier

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:22.680
looks something like this.

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:24.745
He now has 2 rabbit traps.

00:05:24.745 --> 00:05:27.690
Or he has 2 more rabbit
traps, he already had 1.

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:30.135
So now he has 3 rabbit
traps after two days.

00:05:30.135 --> 00:05:32.260
And so now if he wanted to
devote themselves purely

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:35.130
to rabbit trapping he
can get 8 rabbits a day.

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:37.340
Or he could do some
combination in between.

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:39.850
And actually this curve,
it shouldn't go up at all.

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:40.720
I don't want to give
you the impression

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:41.970
that it went up and then down.

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:44.490
It just goes kind of
straight and does something

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:45.844
like that right over here.

00:05:45.844 --> 00:05:47.260
So this right over
here, I'll call

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:51.430
that the production
possibilities frontier 2.

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:55.300
So what this hunter-gatherer
is doing in this scenario

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:59.280
right here is, he is
making an investment.

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:01.540
He is accumulating capital.

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:04.650
This right over here,
this is capital.

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:09.887
He is choosing, instead of to
consume all of his resources--

00:06:09.887 --> 00:06:11.220
so there's two things he can do.

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:14.620
He can either spend all of
his time in pure consumption,

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:17.120
getting as many rabbits
as possible a day

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:19.570
and then eating them
all, pure consumption.

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:22.080
Or he could reduce
his consumption

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:23.860
and then allocate
some of his resources

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:25.460
towards and investment.

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:29.800
So this right over here,
this is an investment.

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:32.190
It makes him more productive.

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:34.357
This right over
here is consumption.

00:06:34.357 --> 00:06:35.940
There's some base
level of consumption

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:38.350
he needs to survive.

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:40.180
But if he invests,
then it increases

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:42.740
his overall productive capacity.

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:44.420
So if you viewed
him as an economy

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:47.860
by himself, by investing
instead of consuming

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:49.282
all of his resources,
by investing

00:06:49.282 --> 00:06:50.990
some of his resources--
and in this case,

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:53.670
his resources are his
time and his expertise--

00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:56.190
by investing some of them
he's able to increase

00:06:56.190 --> 00:06:57.680
his productivity.

00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:59.370
And if you viewed
him as an economy,

00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:05.760
he's experiencing
economic growth.

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:07.680
And so there's multiple
types of investments.

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:10.970
And we'll talk about
these in multiple videos.

00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:13.800
In this case, he is doing
capital accumulation.

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:16.620
He is building tools that
will make him more productive.

00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:20.130
Another type of
investment is essentially

00:07:20.130 --> 00:07:23.110
technological change,
technological improvement,

00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:25.140
which would actually make
his tools even better.

00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:27.800
So we could maybe draw another
production possibilities

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:30.680
frontier between
making rabbit traps

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:34.600
and then doing R&amp;D on inventing
new types of rabbit traps.

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:36.600
And so he could decide
which of those two things

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:38.270
he wants to decide between.

00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:40.790
But what I wanted you to
just appreciate in this video

00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:42.660
is that the production
possibilities

00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:44.480
frontier can change.

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:46.580
You can become more
productive if you

00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:50.520
do have investment in R&amp;D
or capital accumulation.

00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:54.600
And in this case, that just
happened to be rabbit traps.
