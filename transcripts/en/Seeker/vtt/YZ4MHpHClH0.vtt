00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:02.320
Peanut allergies are serious.

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:04.540
People can die even with just a tiny exposure.

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:08.690
Unless they take a bit of poop bacteria with
their peanuts.

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:10.340
It’s not your imagination.

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:12.450
Food allergies are more visible now than ever.

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.450
A 2010 study found peanut allergies are increasing.

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.449
But a new double-blind, long-term clinical
trial found success with a pill.

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:25.390
A prized probiotic peanut protein pill from
poop.

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:31.529
For 18 months, kids took a pill with a specific
strain of Lactobacillus rhamnosus part of

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.390
a bacterial family that was isolated from
feces.

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.000
Our gut is a veritable metropolis of bacteria
that help digest food, work with our immune

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.800
system and just keep things rolling.

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:49.620
Lactobacillus is a probiotic, meaning it may
even help other bacteria flourish in the gut.

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.230
Bacteria helpin’ bacteria.

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:55.300
Also in the pill was peanut protein… and
the amount of protein increased throughout

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:56.330
the treatment.

00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:01.050
After that, the kids didn’t have terrifying
allergic reactions to eating peanuts.

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.220
It’s like a peanut allergy cure!

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:08.180
Now, it’s been four years, and more than
two-thirds of the kids can still eat peanuts!

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.229
Meanwhile, almost none of the placebo kids
can.

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:14.020
This is a game-changer for parents with kids
who are like: peanut?

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:15.439
Pea-nope.

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:17.920
No one really knows why allergies are increasing.

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:23.210
Epigenetics, the industrial food system, excessive
cleanliness, or it could be that we’re,

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:24.760
simply, more aware of the allergies now.

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:30.580
According to the CDC, only eight foods account
for 90-percent of allergies -- milk, eggs,

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:34.850
peanuts, tree nuts, wheat, soy, fish and crustacean
shellfish.

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:40.679
It’s important to note, 150 to 200 people
die in the U.S. annually from food allergies,

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:43.250
with about half being peanut related.

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:46.090
But peanut allergies aren’t that dangerous…

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:50.150
47 people die from lightning strikes each
year you’re only twice as likely to die

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:52.439
from peanuts as being hit by lightning.

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:57.899
However, accidental ingestion of peanuts Is
a huge worry for parents, and a pill changes

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:59.079
the whole calculus!

00:01:59.079 --> 00:02:03.189
If we can knock down one of these food allergies
hopefully we can move onto another…

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:05.729
I humbly request it be shellfish.

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.190
I really miss all-you-can-eat shrimp.

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.190
Like.

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:10.190
A lot.

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:12.340
Those lobster commercials are torture.

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.330
This isn’t the first time we’ve talked
about this allergy, for more on why it’s

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.129
becoming so common -- watch this video.

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:19.269
Are you allergic to any foods?

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:20.290
Shrimp for me.

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:21.290
Sadly.

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:22.290
Tell me yours in the comments.

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:28.560
Thanks for watching seeker, please, take a
second and subscribe so we know you’re out

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.140
there.
