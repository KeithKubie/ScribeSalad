00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:01.720
- [Narrator] Can flexible classrooms

00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:04.290
actually boost student achievement?

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:05.850
Will this comfortable chair

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.630
and this emoji pillow
improve academic performance?

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:11.280
Well, no.

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.900
It's not the furniture,
but a study out of England

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:17.630
looked at 27 schools, 153 classrooms,

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:21.650
and 3,766 students across the country

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:24.440
and concluded that flexible
welcoming classrooms

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:26.400
did raise test scores.

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.380
In fact, classroom flexibility
is about as important

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:31.750
as air quality, light, or temperature

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:34.190
in boosting academic outcomes.

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:37.020
And taken together, flexibility
and a student's sense

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.990
of ownership account for over a quarter

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:42.720
of the academic benefit
attributed to classroom design.

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:44.460
So what's happening?

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.340
It turns out that flexible classrooms

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:48.890
change teaching and learning habits.

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:51.550
They are versatile, so they
support a broader range

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:55.610
of educational strategies
and they're modifiable too.

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:56.930
So they can quickly be adapted

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:59.500
to meet individual and group needs.

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:00.800
That makes a big difference,

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.300
because the research shows
that using a mix of strategies

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.890
to teach a lesson, direct instruction,

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:08.550
group work, independent inquiry,

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:11.530
drives deeper learning among students.

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:13.640
So changing the furniture
in your classroom

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.130
will almost certainly
have no impact at all.

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:18.570
If you don't change your teaching too.

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:19.870
