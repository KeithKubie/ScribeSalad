00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:03.490
We're in the last section
of test 6.

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:06.170
Section 9, page 743.

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:09.660
Problem number 1.

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.900
For which of the following
values of m will the value of

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:20.130
3m minus 1 be greater than 10?

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.570
So we add 1 to both sides.

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:26.960
3m is going to be
greater than 11.

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.050
Divide both sides by 3, and you
don't have to switch the

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:30.530
inequality because
3 is positive.

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:34.650
So you get m is going to
be greater than 11/3.

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:36.580
And 11/3, this is what?

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:39.480
This is equal to 3 and 2/3.

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.880
So anything greater than
3, really, any integer

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:42.790
greater than 3.

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:44.310
If you look at all the choices,
the only one that's

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:50.040
greater than 3 and 2/3
is choice A, 4.

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.620
Next problem.

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:58.650
If a times k is equal to k--
sorry, if a times k is equal

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:05.050
to a for all values of a,
what is the value of k?

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:06.590
And the reason why they have
to say all values of a is

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:09.890
because if a was 0, then that
would work for any k.

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:12.230
But if it's for all values of
k, you divide both sides of

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:17.110
this equation by a, you
get k is equal to a/a

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:18.840
which is equal to 1.

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.790
So k would have be equal
to 1, which is D.

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:22.430
And you knew that.

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:23.790
You didn't have to
do any algebra.

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.980
If I multiply something times
some number and I get the

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:30.470
original thing, that number's
going to be 1.

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:31.720
Problem 3.

00:01:34.814 --> 00:01:36.064
Image.

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:42.370
So let me draw what
they've drawn.

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:45.400
So I have one parallel
line like that.

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:47.310
I'm assuming they're parallel,
because they look parallel in

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.060
the picture.

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.510
And then there's a line that
comes down like this.

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:57.266
There's another line that
goes up like that.

00:01:57.266 --> 00:01:59.580
And what do they tell
us about it?

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:03.280
They tell us that this is
x degrees right here.

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.870
This is z degrees.

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:08.330
This is y degrees.

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:09.389
This is line l.

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:11.500
This is line m.

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.795
In the figure above,
l is parallel to m.

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:22.655
If x is equal to 80 degrees-- so
this is 80 degrees-- and y

00:02:22.655 --> 00:02:29.850
is equal to 70 degrees, what
is the value of z?

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:32.860
So the trick here is just to
see the opposite angles.

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:35.800
In fact, the information that
they're parallel lines is

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.970
actually just extra information
to start making

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:39.870
you do corresponding
angles and all that

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:40.850
kind of fancy stuff.

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:42.380
Which you could do.

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:44.950
But the really easy thing is to
realize that x, this angle,

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:47.020
is the same thing as this
angle, which is

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:49.130
going to be 80 degrees.

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.400
Right?

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.090
Because they're opposite angles
of intersecting lines.

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:54.170
And this-- if that's 70,
then this angle is

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:56.260
also going to be 70.

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.840
And now 80 plus 70 plus z has to
equal 180, because they're

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.095
all in the same triangle
together.

00:03:02.095 --> 00:03:07.920
So 80 plus 70 plus z
is equal to 180.

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.660
150 plus z is equal to 180.

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:14.750
Subtract 150 from both
sides, you get z

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:17.260
is equal to 30 degrees.

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.080
The other way you could have
done it is you could have used

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:21.990
the information about
the parallel lines.

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:24.350
And you could have said, well,
the corresponding angle here

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:26.360
is here, so that this
is also 80 degrees.

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:27.920
And you could have said the
corresponding angle here is

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:30.080
also here, so this
is 70 degrees.

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:31.760
And then you could have said
all three of these are

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.970
supplementary, and that they
would have to add up to 180.

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:37.290
And you'd get z equals
30 either way.

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:38.540
And that is choice A.

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:43.070
Next problem.

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:50.690
Problem 4.

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:53.890
The scenic route from Mia's
home to her office is 5

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:56.000
kilometers longer than
the direct route.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.600
So I'll call S for scenic.

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:02.650
S is equal to the direct
route plus 4.

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:05.375
The scenic route is 4 miles
longer than the direct route,

00:04:05.375 --> 00:04:07.030
or 4 kilometers.

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:09.460
When she goes by the scenic
route and returns by the

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:13.360
direct route, the round
trip is 35 kilometers.

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:14.150
So that means what?

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:18.010
The distance of the scenic route
plus the distance of the

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:26.240
direct route is equal
to 35 kilometers.

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:28.550
How many kilometers is
the direct route?

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:31.010
So we want to solve for this.

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:40.600
So this top equation, we can
rewrite this as S minus D is

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:43.420
equal to 4.

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:45.580
And actually just to make
things-- well, let me write

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:46.270
that down right here.

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:51.580
So you get S minus
D is equal to 4.

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:54.240
And we can multiply this
equation by negative 1, so you

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:56.840
cancel out the S's instead of
the D's, but since it's so

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:58.560
convenient already, let's just
cancel out the D's and solve

00:04:58.560 --> 00:04:59.410
for the scenic route.

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:00.610
The S's.

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:03.080
So this is just a
system with two

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:04.110
equations and two unknowns.

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:06.180
So let's add these
two equations.

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:11.740
So you get 2S-- D plus
D is 0-- is equal to

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:18.430
35 plus 4 is 39.

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:19.450
The numbers look strange.

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:25.770
The scenic distance is 39/2.

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:26.360
Right?

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:28.390
That's 39/2 kilometers.

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:29.640
And what is that equal to?

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:31.190
If I were to write that
as a mixed number.

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:31.840
Let's see.

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:35.625
38 is-- that's 19 and
1/2 kilometers.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.620
A little less than
20 kilometers.

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:42.060
That's the scenic route.

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:44.950
The direct route is 4 less
than that, right?

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:47.380
We said the scenic route is 4
more than the direct route.

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:49.890
So the direct route is going
to be that minus 4.

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:51.200
So what's 19 minus 4?

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:53.760
It's 15, and then you still
have that half there.

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:55.990
15 and 1/2 kilometers.

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:58.370
And I don't see that
choice there, so I

00:05:58.370 --> 00:05:59.890
must have made a mistake.

00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:05.200
Let me do it here, just
to see where-- I

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:06.270
don't see that choice.

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:09.240
The scenic route from Mia's
home to her office is 5

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:11.450
kilometers longer than
the direct route.

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:12.350
Right.

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:16.170
The scenic route-- we could even
say scenic route minus--

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:18.100
oh, sorry, it's 5 kilometers
longer.

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:19.020
Sorry.

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:20.180
This is 5.

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:21.730
That was my mistake.

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:23.020
5 kilometers longer.

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:25.470
Scenic minus direct is 5.

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:27.120
They normally don't give weird
numbers like that.

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:29.350
So this is 5.

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:31.150
This is 40.

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:33.360
This is 40/2.

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:34.540
This is 20.

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:35.940
Hope I'm not confusing you.

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:38.280
And then if you're going to be
5 less than 20, it's going to

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:40.220
be 15 kilometers, right?

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:43.030
I hope you see what
I just did.

00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:45.140
I wrote 4 kilometers longer
instead of 5.

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:48.250
That was my mistake, which
you should avoid.

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:49.500
Next problem.

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:54.120
Let me switch colors.

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:58.880
I think that yellow induces
careless mistakes.

00:06:58.880 --> 00:06:59.950
5.

00:06:59.950 --> 00:07:03.650
A complete cycle of a traffic
light takes 80 seconds.

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:10.030
During each cycle, the light
is green for 40 seconds.

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:17.260
Amber-- I guess that's red--
amber for 10 seconds.

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:18.380
Oh, I guess amber is yellow.

00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:19.400
I don't know my colors.

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:22.690
And red for 30 seconds.

00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:25.020
And the whole cycle
takes 80 seconds.

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:27.500
If you add those up.

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:30.170
At a randomly chosen time, what
is the probability that

00:07:30.170 --> 00:07:32.630
the light will not be red?

00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:34.470
So the probability that the
light will not be red is the

00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:37.980
probability that it's going
to be green or amber.

00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:43.730
And it's green or amber for 40
plus 10, for 50 seconds out of

00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:45.570
a total of 80 seconds, right?

00:07:45.570 --> 00:07:48.290
So the probability that when
you randomly walk up to the

00:07:48.290 --> 00:07:51.260
light, that it's going to be
green or amber-- or not red--

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:53.370
is going to be 50 seconds.

00:07:53.370 --> 00:07:57.180
50/80, which is 5/8.

00:07:57.180 --> 00:08:01.030
And that is choice B.

00:08:01.030 --> 00:08:02.280
Next problem.

00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:06.430
Problem 6.

00:08:06.430 --> 00:08:09.310
For a certain hot water heater,
the increase in

00:08:09.310 --> 00:08:12.640
heating expenses is directly
proportional to the increase

00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:14.680
in the water temperature
setting.

00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:19.960
If heating expenses increase
by $24 when the water

00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:23.460
temperature is increased by
20 degrees Fahrenheit-- so

00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:33.780
expense goes up by 24 when
temperature is increased by 20

00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:37.630
degrees Fahrenheit.

00:08:37.630 --> 00:08:40.159
By how much will heating
expenses increase when the

00:08:40.159 --> 00:08:43.030
water temperature setting is
increased by 15 degrees

00:08:43.030 --> 00:08:43.900
Fahrenheit?

00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:46.210
So this is just a
ratio problem.

00:08:46.210 --> 00:08:52.160
So you say, well, the expenses
go up $24 when we have a

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:54.990
20-degree increase
in temperature.

00:08:54.990 --> 00:08:58.340
So then how many dollars will
it increase when you have a

00:08:58.340 --> 00:09:00.780
15-degree increase?

00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:04.280
The denominator in both cases
was the change in temperature.

00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:06.160
And then this is the
change in expense.

00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:08.410
The triangle means
change, right?

00:09:08.410 --> 00:09:10.920
So you just have to make sure
that the ratios are consistent

00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:11.830
and let's just multiply.

00:09:11.830 --> 00:09:15.990
You get 20-- actually, and so
we don't have to get big

00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:18.420
numbers, let me reduce
this fraction.

00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:19.350
Divide the top and the bottom.

00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:24.500
This is the same thing as
6/5 is equal to x/15.

00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:25.920
This is easier to
multiply now.

00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:30.820
You get 5x is equal
to 15 times 6.

00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:32.400
Divide both sides by 5.

00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:37.070
You get x is equal to 15
times 6 divided by 5.

00:09:37.070 --> 00:09:40.460
That's 3, that's 1, that's 18.

00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:45.240
So the change in expense will
be $18, and that's choice B.

00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:47.060
See you in the next video.
