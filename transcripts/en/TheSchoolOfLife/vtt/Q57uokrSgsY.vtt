00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:06.049
Flattery has a bad name. It’s associated
with saying something upbeat but untrue in

00:00:06.049 --> 00:00:12.659
order to hoodwink its unsuspecting target
for low personal gain. In Aesop’s famous

00:00:12.659 --> 00:00:17.980
fable, The Fox and the Crow, an ugly crow
has found a piece of cheese and retired to

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:24.200
a branch to eat it. A sly fox, wanting it
for himself, flatters the crow, calling it

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:29.470
beautiful and wondering whether its voice
will be as sweet as its appearance. The crow

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:35.010
lets out a horrific screeching sound and the
cheese drops straight into the fox’s gaping

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:41.870
expectant mocking jaw. But there’s another
form of flattery with more valuable and ethical

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:47.949
ambitions. Parents of small children invariably
discover its uses – which deserve to be

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:54.100
better known and practiced around all age
groups. Let’s imagine that a child isn’t

00:00:54.100 --> 00:01:01.949
yet entirely kind to their brother, or good
at drawing, or a perfect cook or helpful around

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:07.190
the house – but the parent declares that
they are so as to encourage and make more

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:14.390
concrete what is as yet only tentative and
fragile in their ambivalent nature. The child

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:22.390
is being helped to end up as some of the things
he has already been described as being. In

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:27.960
1956, the Brazilian architect Oscar Niemeyer
was invited to create a new capital city for

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:35.510
his nation: Brasilia. Brazil is a country
of frenetic economic activity, of rainforest

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:42.210
and Amazonian villages, favelas, soccer, beaches
and intense disagreement about political priorities…

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:48.520
none of which is apparent from contemplation
of the beautiful, serene, futuristic rational

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:54.770
architecture of Brasilia. One day, the buildings
propose, Brazil will be a place where rationality

00:01:54.770 --> 00:02:00.691
is powerful; where order and harmony reign;
where elegance is normal. There will be no

00:02:00.691 --> 00:02:06.310
more corruption or chaos. In offices, efficient
secretaries will type up judicious briefing

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:11.780
notes; the filing systems will be perfect
– nothing will get lost, overlooked, neglected

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:13.560
or mislaid; negotiations will take place in
an atmosphere of impersonal wisdom. The country

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:20.610
will be perfectly managed. Oscar Niemeyer’s
capital is an essay in flattery. It hints

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:27.590
that certain desirable qualities which are
as yet only very latent could one day be central

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:32.990
to the country and its governing class. Shortly
after the capital buildings were completed,

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:38.980
a journalist asked Niemeyer why he had designed
a capital that was so dramatically unlike

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:44.200
the country it was meant to represent. ‘It
won’t be one day,’ said Niemeyer – with

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:52.280
a wry smile. Brazilians continue to wait.
And the finest buildings of Brasilia continue

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:58.870
to inspire. We need flattery because we so
badly need to be guided to develop beyond

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:04.860
what we are right now. We need other people’s
belief in us to bolster our capacities for

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:10.530
reform and growth. We need a chance to grow
into the person we have flatteringly been

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:17.950
described as already being. Consider a painting
by Velázquez, The Surrender of Breda. There’s

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:23.260
been a battle between Spain and the Netherlands.
Spain has won. The picture shows the Spanish

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:28.340
general, Spinola receiving the key to the
city of Breda from the representative of the

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:35.390
defeated Dutch forces, Justin of Nassau. What’s
striking is how cordial everything is. Historians

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:41.750
report that both sides behaved extremely well.
There was no recrimination or wanton bloodshed.

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:48.450
The painting is a memorial to unusually noble
conduct. But it’s not a comprehensive or

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:55.770
accurate account of war or sieges; just as
Brasilia is not a completely accurate presentation

00:03:55.770 --> 00:04:03.129
of what Brazil is like. Instead, each of these
works presents an ideal in the hope of generating

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:09.960
a subsequent reality. We should learn to be
gentler on flattery and the energy it can

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:15.680
lend us to move towards greater generosity,
intelligence and wisdom. We should use its

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:21.440
benign power in order to bring about a world
where we’ll more often be able simply to

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:27.520
praise one another, and no longer merely just to flatter.

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:31.320
We believe in making the world a more emotionally intelligent place

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:35.920
and to that end we have now also published some extraordinary books.

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:42.320
As well as other merchandise that reinforces some of the other themes illustrated in our videos.
