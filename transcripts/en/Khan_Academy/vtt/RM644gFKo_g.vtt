00:00:00.167 --> 00:00:01.978
- [Voiceover] So I have
a finite series here

00:00:01.978 --> 00:00:04.022
expressed in sigma notation
and I encourage you

00:00:04.022 --> 00:00:06.622
to pause the video and
see if you can figure out

00:00:06.622 --> 00:00:08.062
what this evaluates to.

00:00:08.062 --> 00:00:11.916
This is going to evaluate to a number.

00:00:11.916 --> 00:00:14.168
So assuming you've had a go at it,

00:00:14.168 --> 00:00:15.283
let's work through this together.

00:00:15.283 --> 00:00:19.068
So this is a sum from k
equals 1 to k equals 550,

00:00:19.068 --> 00:00:21.808
so we're going to have 550 terms here

00:00:21.808 --> 00:00:24.896
and it's the sum from k
equals 1 to k equals 550

00:00:24.896 --> 00:00:27.450
of 2k plus 50,

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:29.238
so whenever I try to evaluate a series,

00:00:29.238 --> 00:00:31.397
I like to just expand
out the sum a little bit

00:00:31.397 --> 00:00:34.137
just so that I can get a
feel for what it looks like,

00:00:34.137 --> 00:00:34.740
so let's see.

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:35.948
This is going to look like,

00:00:35.948 --> 00:00:38.038
when k is equal 1, this is going to be

00:00:38.038 --> 00:00:40.894
2 times 1 plus 50.

00:00:40.894 --> 00:00:42.589
When k is equal to 2, it's going to be

00:00:42.589 --> 00:00:45.212
2 times 2 plus 50.

00:00:45.212 --> 00:00:46.652
When k is equal to 3, it's going to be

00:00:46.652 --> 00:00:49.485
2 times 3 plus 50.

00:00:49.485 --> 00:00:51.505
And we're going to keep
going all the way until

00:00:51.505 --> 00:00:52.921
we get to the last term,

00:00:52.921 --> 00:00:55.266
when k is equal to 550, it's going to be

00:00:55.266 --> 00:00:59.654
2 times 550 plus 50.

00:00:59.654 --> 00:01:00.328
So let's see.

00:01:00.328 --> 00:01:01.744
This first term is going to be,

00:01:01.744 --> 00:01:05.761
it evalutes to 52

00:01:05.761 --> 00:01:08.362
plus, this next term is 2 times 2 plus 50

00:01:08.362 --> 00:01:10.312
is going to be 54,

00:01:10.312 --> 00:01:12.146
plus the next term, 2 times 3 is 6

00:01:12.146 --> 00:01:14.352
plus 50 is 56,

00:01:14.352 --> 00:01:16.767
and we're going to go all the way,

00:01:16.767 --> 00:01:19.832
all the way to our last term,

00:01:19.832 --> 00:01:23.384
2 times 550 is 1100 plus 50

00:01:23.384 --> 00:01:25.776
is going to be 1150.

00:01:25.776 --> 00:01:27.749
So that gives us a good feel for this sum,

00:01:27.749 --> 00:01:28.492
for this series.

00:01:28.492 --> 00:01:31.256
We're going to start 52, and
we're just going to keep adding

00:01:31.256 --> 00:01:33.606
2 for each successive term, all the way

00:01:33.606 --> 00:01:35.185
until we get to 1150,

00:01:35.185 --> 00:01:38.320
and we're going to take
the sum of all of these,

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:40.549
and since each successive
term, we're increasing

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:41.663
by the same amount,

00:01:41.663 --> 00:01:43.776
we're increasing by 2,

00:01:43.776 --> 00:01:46.237
we're increasing by 2,
we can recognize this

00:01:46.237 --> 00:01:48.931
as an arithmetic series.

00:01:48.931 --> 00:01:51.578
We are increasing by the same amount

00:01:51.578 --> 00:01:52.832
each time.

00:01:52.832 --> 00:01:54.434
And there is a formula for the sum

00:01:54.434 --> 00:01:56.384
of an arithmetic series, and
first we're just going to

00:01:56.384 --> 00:01:57.406
apply the formula,

00:01:57.406 --> 00:01:58.985
but then we're going to get
a little bit of an intuitive

00:01:58.985 --> 00:02:01.098
sense for why that formula works,

00:02:01.098 --> 00:02:02.932
and actually, in other
videos, we have proved

00:02:02.932 --> 00:02:05.440
this formula, but it's always
good to get a sense that,

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:06.818
you know, that this formula
just doesn't come out of

00:02:06.818 --> 00:02:10.232
thin air, so the formula for the sum

00:02:10.232 --> 00:02:12.855
of an arithmetic series,

00:02:12.855 --> 00:02:16.222
so the sum of the first
n terms is going to be

00:02:16.222 --> 00:02:20.634
the first term plus the nth term

00:02:20.634 --> 00:02:22.932
over 2, so it's really the,

00:02:22.932 --> 00:02:25.394
it's really the arithmetic
mean of the first and

00:02:25.394 --> 00:02:27.414
the last terms,

00:02:27.414 --> 00:02:28.226
you could say the average,

00:02:28.226 --> 00:02:29.991
in, I guess, everyday language,

00:02:29.991 --> 00:02:31.988
average of the first and last terms

00:02:31.988 --> 00:02:36.771
and then times the number
of terms you actually have,

00:02:36.771 --> 00:02:38.977
so if we were to try to
apply it to this case,

00:02:38.977 --> 00:02:40.974
we're trying to take the sum,

00:02:40.974 --> 00:02:43.458
sum of the first 550 terms,

00:02:43.458 --> 00:02:45.966
I'll do this in a new
color just for kicks.

00:02:45.966 --> 00:02:47.870
All right, so we're going to take the sum

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:52.165
of the first 550 terms,

00:02:52.165 --> 00:02:54.464
and it's going to be
equal to the first term,

00:02:54.464 --> 00:02:57.552
so that's 52 plus the last term,

00:02:57.552 --> 00:03:00.803
the nth term, 1150,

00:03:00.803 --> 00:03:02.451
it's really just the average of those two,

00:03:02.451 --> 00:03:04.750
the average of the first and the last term

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:06.468
and then times the
number of terms we have,

00:03:06.468 --> 00:03:09.579
times 550,

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:10.787
so what is this going to be?

00:03:10.787 --> 00:03:12.180
Well, we could simplify this a little bit.

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:15.709
If we're going to take 550 divided by 2,

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:17.265
this is going to be,

00:03:17.265 --> 00:03:18.495
I could write this as times,

00:03:18.495 --> 00:03:19.262
actually, let me just,

00:03:19.262 --> 00:03:21.584
let me just simply this
in a different way.

00:03:21.584 --> 00:03:24.532
So this is going to be the same thing as,

00:03:24.532 --> 00:03:25.508
I could write this,

00:03:25.508 --> 00:03:26.738
52 divided,

00:03:26.738 --> 00:03:27.899
well, let me just add first.

00:03:27.899 --> 00:03:32.899
This is going to be 1,202

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:35.120
over 2.

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:36.026
All right, did I do that right?

00:03:36.026 --> 00:03:39.091
Yeah, 1,202 over 2

00:03:39.091 --> 00:03:42.179
times 550.

00:03:42.179 --> 00:03:47.179
Now, 1202 divided by 2 is going to be 601,

00:03:47.217 --> 00:03:49.795
so this is equal to 601

00:03:49.795 --> 00:03:52.929
times 550.

00:03:52.929 --> 00:03:55.112
And let's see, I can multiply that out.

00:03:55.112 --> 00:03:58.711
So, let me just do 550

00:03:58.711 --> 00:04:01.822
times 601,

00:04:01.822 --> 00:04:05.537
so 1 times 550 is 550,

00:04:05.537 --> 00:04:06.977
and then I have a zero here,

00:04:06.977 --> 00:04:08.277
but I just have a zero there,

00:04:08.277 --> 00:04:09.763
so zero times 550,

00:04:09.763 --> 00:04:11.481
I'm just going to get a bunch of zeros,

00:04:11.481 --> 00:04:14.059
and then I go to the hundreds place.

00:04:14.059 --> 00:04:17.541
6 times zero is zero.

00:04:17.541 --> 00:04:21.303
6 times 5 is 30.

00:04:21.303 --> 00:04:24.879
6 times 5 is 30 plus 3 is 33.

00:04:24.879 --> 00:04:25.993
You add it all together,

00:04:25.993 --> 00:04:27.711
we get a zero, we get a 5,

00:04:27.711 --> 00:04:29.430
we get a 5, we get a zero,

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:31.357
we get a 3, we get a 3.

00:04:31.357 --> 00:04:35.258
We get 330,550.

00:04:35.258 --> 00:04:36.976
That's what this whole thing,

00:04:36.976 --> 00:04:39.716
that's what this whole thing sums up to.

00:04:39.716 --> 00:04:42.780
Now, I just said that we'll
get a little bit of intuition

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:45.451
for why we were able to
just apply this formula,

00:04:45.451 --> 00:04:47.146
and let's just think about what the sum

00:04:47.146 --> 00:04:48.887
of the first 550 terms is,

00:04:48.887 --> 00:04:50.745
and I just wrote it down up here.

00:04:50.745 --> 00:04:52.602
So, let me write it,

00:04:52.602 --> 00:04:54.529
I'm just going to switch colors again.

00:04:54.529 --> 00:04:58.593
So, we're going to have the
sum of the first 550 terms,

00:04:58.593 --> 00:05:00.288
which is what we just wrote over here,

00:05:00.288 --> 00:05:01.240
we already said this is going to be

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:05.512
52 plus 54 plus 56

00:05:05.512 --> 00:05:08.020
plus, and we're going to
keep going all the way

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:09.854
to 1150.

00:05:09.854 --> 00:05:11.108
I'm going to write it again,

00:05:11.108 --> 00:05:13.592
the sum of the first 550 terms,

00:05:13.592 --> 00:05:15.148
but I'm going to just write it in reverse.

00:05:15.148 --> 00:05:17.284
We can obviously swap the
order in which we add.

00:05:17.284 --> 00:05:19.513
It's going to be 1150

00:05:19.513 --> 00:05:23.298
plus 1150 minus 2, which is

00:05:23.298 --> 00:05:26.920
1148, plus that minus 2,

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:30.519
which is 1146,

00:05:30.519 --> 00:05:34.373
and we go all the way to the first term,

00:05:34.373 --> 00:05:37.345
all the way to 52.

00:05:37.345 --> 00:05:38.576
Now, what I want to do is just

00:05:38.576 --> 00:05:39.899
I want to add these two sums,

00:05:39.899 --> 00:05:42.546
so I'm just going to get 2
times the sum of the first 550,

00:05:42.546 --> 00:05:43.963
so if I had the two left sides,

00:05:43.963 --> 00:05:47.445
I would have 2 times the
sum of the first 550 terms,

00:05:47.445 --> 00:05:50.278
and we do this generally
when we prove this formula

00:05:50.278 --> 00:05:50.998
in previous videos,

00:05:50.998 --> 00:05:53.157
but I always like to get a
sense of where it comes from

00:05:53.157 --> 00:05:55.549
and so this is going to be equal to,

00:05:55.549 --> 00:05:58.892
well if I add these two
terms right over here,

00:05:58.892 --> 00:05:59.844
I get what?

00:05:59.844 --> 00:06:02.422
I get 1202.

00:06:02.422 --> 00:06:04.209
That number should look familiar.

00:06:04.209 --> 00:06:07.646
And then if I add these
two, right over here,

00:06:07.646 --> 00:06:08.691
what do I get?

00:06:08.691 --> 00:06:11.082
I get 1202.

00:06:11.082 --> 00:06:14.403
And then if I add, I think
you see where this is going,

00:06:14.403 --> 00:06:17.862
and then if I add these two characters,

00:06:17.862 --> 00:06:18.628
what do I get?

00:06:18.628 --> 00:06:22.645
I get 1202, all the way

00:06:22.645 --> 00:06:24.735
to these last two characters.

00:06:24.735 --> 00:06:25.571
You add them together, what do you get?

00:06:25.571 --> 00:06:27.939
You get 1202,

00:06:27.939 --> 00:06:31.004
so how many 1202s do I have?

00:06:31.004 --> 00:06:33.256
Well I have 550 of them.

00:06:33.256 --> 00:06:35.485
There are 550 of these terms.

00:06:35.485 --> 00:06:36.995
So this is going to be equal to

00:06:36.995 --> 00:06:41.476
550 times 1202.

00:06:41.476 --> 00:06:44.007
And so if you just wanted
to solve for this sum,

00:06:44.007 --> 00:06:46.584
you just divide all
these sides divided by 2,

00:06:46.584 --> 00:06:48.720
so you divide by 2.

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:51.042
You divide by 2.

00:06:51.042 --> 00:06:54.780
You divide by 2, and that's
exactly what we did over here.

00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:58.426
550 times 1202, divided by 2.

00:06:58.426 --> 00:07:00.928
So hopefully that gives you
an intuition for things.
