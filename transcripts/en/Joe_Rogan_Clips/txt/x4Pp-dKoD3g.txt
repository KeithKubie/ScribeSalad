Speaker 1:          00:00          The Joe Rogan experience, but like Japan is one of the most unhappy countries in the world. People at the suicide rate is off the charts, but they take themselves out. Yeah. You know, in America it's like, let me, who can I take with me? Yeah. I don't know what that, what that is. Well, Japan emphasizes humility and uh, they rewarded like if in the emphasize being polite and orderly, it's really interesting. Um, there was a dis piece I was watching on Youtube of these people that live in cyber cafes, that they have cyber cafes that are open 24 hours a day in Japan and they have like this little cubicles that you taken there and they're just online on their computer and they have all their things there and that's where they live. And they shower and then they go back to the little cubicle. But this woman was saying that it made her feel like she wasn't alone, but she wasn't with people either.

Speaker 1:          00:54          Like she likes that, that like she wants to know that there's people around her, but she doesn't want anybody in her life and also dark. Yeah. Yeah. That's super fucking dark, sad. Just the loneliness like that. That's a giant issue apparently in Japan is how lonely people are, which is incredibly ironic when you consider that it's probably one of the most population dense places on earth and Tokyo at least. Oh yeah. I think it just working their asses off. I mean they fucking loved at the jump in front of the trends they live for it. Like it really is like the of countries that it's the least happy country in the world. Wow. I think number like the happiest is like someone's Scandinavian. Great. Yeah. Sweden or some shit. Yeah. Yeah. Finland, I think Finland like ranks very highly on that. Yeah. Why is it got it.

Speaker 1:          01:43          The thing I was watching said it was like a sense of community. I think that checks them live together and like they eat their meals together as like a neighborhood almost and they just like everyone contributes and they're just happy and content. That makes sense. The numbers are smaller too and think that that helps also. It's gorgeous up there. That helps too. It's a lot of factors there, right? Yeah. Like, what's a big city in Finland? Helsinki. How many people's at 50 how many people live in Helsinki Fizzy? 50 55 at 50 I pay you right? Feel like I would, I bet Helsinki as 1.2 million people. How many people Helsinki have? That's a wild guess. I don't know why I had to put the 0.2 in there. I'm hedging my bet. Like if I was on the prices right thing instead. It's the biggest, but the thing I pull up doesn't say the second largest says 279,000 so say what he'll think he does.

Speaker 1:          02:34          Well, it doesn't, you can't. Doesn't. If you Google population of Helsinki, the very first thing I had, which was the biggest cities in Finland, I figured it would have had, it just blew up. Five 58 558,000 yeah, that ain't shit. Wow. That's it. That's why they're happy. It's basically like four boulders. Yeah. For Boulder. Colorado's and it's a whole country. Yeah. You go to boulder, some of the nicest people ever. Why 100,000 of them? That's it. Hard to build there. Beautiful, bold, beautiful, beautiful, gorgeous, grey people. Little on the social side, but I get it a little too many Birkenstocks and tables and girls could use a little bit more makeup, pull makeup on gals. It's not all it up a little. It's not pronounced Tiva. Tivos maybe it is divas. I Dunno if I've even heard the word weird leather sandals and shit, but it's a cool place, man. But I think, you know, that's what you get if you live around nature, you get a bunch of fit people that like hiking and shared a lot of north face jackets. You know, they've got great weather. Yeah, yeah, they'd really do. They have blue blizzards and snow storms and shit, but they also have like you'll, it'll be 30 degrees in Denver or boulder, and then the next day it'll be 60 yeah. It doesn't make any sense. Okay.
