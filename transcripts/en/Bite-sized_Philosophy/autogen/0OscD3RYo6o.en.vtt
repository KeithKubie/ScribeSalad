all right so you're always in one of

00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:01.500
all right so you're always in one of
 

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:02.720
all right so you're always in one of
these little frameworks and there's just

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:02.730
these little frameworks and there's just
 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:04.550
these little frameworks and there's just
no getting them out of it so and that's

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:04.560
no getting them out of it so and that's
 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.380
no getting them out of it so and that's
because you know at any given moment

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:06.390
because you know at any given moment
 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:08.720
because you know at any given moment
this is like it's like field theory

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730
this is like it's like field theory
 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:10.549
this is like it's like field theory
there used to be psychological theories

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559
there used to be psychological theories
 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:12.140
there used to be psychological theories
that talked about the field of human

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150
that talked about the field of human
 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.120
that talked about the field of human
experience something like that and this

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130
experience something like that and this
 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.129
experience something like that and this
is kind of what that is this is a field

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139
is kind of what that is this is a field
 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.769
is kind of what that is this is a field
and basically what happens is you parse

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779
and basically what happens is you parse
 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:21.230
and basically what happens is you parse
out a little part of the world say

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240
out a little part of the world say
 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.790
out a little part of the world say
and so amount you can handle so let's

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800
and so amount you can handle so let's
 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.439
and so amount you can handle so let's
say it has some duration you're not

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449
say it has some duration you're not
 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.029
say it has some duration you're not
aiming at something 50 years in the

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039
aiming at something 50 years in the
 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:30.470
aiming at something 50 years in the
future it's because how the hell are you

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480
future it's because how the hell are you
 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.120
future it's because how the hell are you
going to do that you there's too many

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130
going to do that you there's too many
 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.850
going to do that you there's too many
variables you know so you're aiming at

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860
variables you know so you're aiming at
 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.060
variables you know so you're aiming at
some handleable amount of time and you

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:37.070
some handleable amount of time and you
 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:39.920
some handleable amount of time and you
posit a goal in there and you plot your

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930
posit a goal in there and you plot your
 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.410
posit a goal in there and you plot your
route and then that tells you what's up

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420
route and then that tells you what's up
 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.389
route and then that tells you what's up
and tells you what's down because up

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399
and tells you what's down because up
 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.040
and tells you what's down because up
moves you towards the goal and down

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050
moves you towards the goal and down
 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.900
moves you towards the goal and down
moves you away from the goal and that

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910
moves you away from the goal and that
 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.819
moves you away from the goal and that
sets up your motivation framework so

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829
sets up your motivation framework so
 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.250
sets up your motivation framework so
that you have some worth detaining you

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260
that you have some worth detaining you
 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.569
that you have some worth detaining you
know that's a really interesting thing

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579
know that's a really interesting thing
 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.020
know that's a really interesting thing
to know - it's like why have a goal well

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030
to know - it's like why have a goal well
 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.819
to know - it's like why have a goal well
it's easy no goal no positive emotions

00:01:00.819 --> 00:01:00.829
it's easy no goal no positive emotions
 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:03.740
it's easy no goal no positive emotions
because you experience positive emotion

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750
because you experience positive emotion
 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.359
because you experience positive emotion
by noticing that you're moving towards a

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369
by noticing that you're moving towards a
 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.390
by noticing that you're moving towards a
goal and so you don't have a goal well

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400
goal and so you don't have a goal well
 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.609
goal and so you don't have a goal well
you can't have any positive emotion so

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619
you can't have any positive emotion so
 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.550
you can't have any positive emotion so
you better have a goal and so you might

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560
you better have a goal and so you might
 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.980
you better have a goal and so you might
say well what should the goal be well we

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990
say well what should the goal be well we
 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.899
say well what should the goal be well we
could start by saying well any goal is

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909
could start by saying well any goal is
 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.940
could start by saying well any goal is
better than none and then we might say

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950
better than none and then we might say
 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.260
better than none and then we might say
well it should be a goal that other

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270
well it should be a goal that other
 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.600
well it should be a goal that other
people will let you pursue because

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610
people will let you pursue because
 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:24.950
people will let you pursue because
otherwise it's going to be kind of

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960
otherwise it's going to be kind of
 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.570
otherwise it's going to be kind of
difficult and maybe they'll be even

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580
difficult and maybe they'll be even
 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.700
difficult and maybe they'll be even
happy to help you pursue it that would

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710
happy to help you pursue it that would
 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.920
happy to help you pursue it that would
even be better and maybe it's a goal

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930
even be better and maybe it's a goal
 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.359
even be better and maybe it's a goal
that would enable you to learn how to

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369
that would enable you to learn how to
 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.550
that would enable you to learn how to
pursue other goals while you pursue that

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560
pursue other goals while you pursue that
 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.219
pursue other goals while you pursue that
goal boy that would really be good and

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229
goal boy that would really be good and
 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.710
goal boy that would really be good and
so you can see that your goal is

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720
so you can see that your goal is
 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.960
so you can see that your goal is
parameterised but that doesn't mean that

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970
parameterised but that doesn't mean that
 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.359
parameterised but that doesn't mean that
any old goal works it means there's some

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369
any old goal works it means there's some
 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.580
any old goal works it means there's some
goals that work nicely and some not so

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590
goals that work nicely and some not so
 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.649
goals that work nicely and some not so
nicely there are playable games and non

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659
nicely there are playable games and non
 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.510
nicely there are playable games and non
playable games that's a good way of

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520
playable games that's a good way of
 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.249
playable games that's a good way of
thinking about it and you want to have a

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259
thinking about it and you want to have a
 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.350
thinking about it and you want to have a
playable game and there's a lot of them

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360
playable game and there's a lot of them
 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.030
playable game and there's a lot of them

you know actor whatever they're your
 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.660
you know actor whatever they're your
playable games and and it's not obvious

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670
playable games and and it's not obvious
 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.969
playable games and and it's not obvious
which one's better but it's certainly

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979
which one's better but it's certainly
 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.830
which one's better but it's certainly
obvious which ones are sustainable in

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840
obvious which ones are sustainable in
 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.020
obvious which ones are sustainable in
which ones are worth so there's a set of

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030
which ones are worth so there's a set of
 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.119
which ones are worth so there's a set of
playable games and you need to extract

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129
playable games and you need to extract
 

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:13.430
playable games and you need to extract
from that set of playable games

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440
from that set of playable games
 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.440
from that set of playable games
game it suits you and that would be

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450
game it suits you and that would be
 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.120
game it suits you and that would be
partly due to your temperament you know

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130
partly due to your temperament you know
 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:18.920
partly due to your temperament you know

because extroverted people want to play
 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.080
because extroverted people want to play

an extroverted game and highly neurotic
 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.000
an extroverted game and highly neurotic
people want to play a safe game and

they can win and you know fine but

they can win and you know fine but

they can win and you know fine but
they're all within the realm of playable

they're all within the realm of playable
 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.160
they're all within the realm of playable
games and that means they're socially

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170
games and that means they're socially
 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.130
games and that means they're socially
acceptable as well and so that means it

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140
acceptable as well and so that means it
 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.130

isn't just arbitrary

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140
isn't just arbitrary
 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.070
isn't just arbitrary
it isn't just relative what you decide

it isn't just relative what you decide

it isn't just relative what you decide
to do it's heavily parameterised there's

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330
to do it's heavily parameterised there's
 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:51.440
to do it's heavily parameterised there's
only there's a set of playable games and

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450
only there's a set of playable games and
 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.650
only there's a set of playable games and
it's large the set is large but it there

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660
it's large the set is large but it there
 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:56.540
it's large the set is large but it there
are commonalities within it and that's

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550
are commonalities within it and that's
 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:58.180
are commonalities within it and that's
why there are commonalities

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:58.190
why there are commonalities
 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:01.180
why there are commonalities
that's why morality has a common basis

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.190
that's why morality has a common basis
 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:03.110
that's why morality has a common basis
fundamentally and so that's partly what

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120
fundamentally and so that's partly what
 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.630
fundamentally and so that's partly what
we're trying to investigate is like

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:04.640
we're trying to investigate is like
 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:07.790
we're trying to investigate is like
what's up what does that mean what does

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:07.800
what's up what does that mean what does
 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.220
what's up what does that mean what does
it mean is there such a thing now

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230
it mean is there such a thing now
 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:13.880
it mean is there such a thing now
one thing to remember is that if you

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:13.890
one thing to remember is that if you
 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:15.410
one thing to remember is that if you
don't erect a hierarchical structure

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420
don't erect a hierarchical structure
 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.590
don't erect a hierarchical structure

positive motivation because you

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:21.570
positive motivation because you
 

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:23.360
positive motivation because you
experience positive motivation in
