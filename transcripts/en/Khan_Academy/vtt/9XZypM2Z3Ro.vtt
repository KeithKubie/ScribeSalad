00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:03.384
Voiceover: The goal of this video 
is to essentially write down

00:00:03.384 --> 00:00:07.726
all the numbers in order
from zero to a 100.

00:00:07.726 --> 00:00:09.954
But I’m going to do it in
an interesting way, a way

00:00:09.954 --> 00:00:11.993
that maybe will allow
us to see some patterns

00:00:11.993 --> 00:00:13.969
in the numbers themselves.

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:20.118
So let me just start, so I’m
gonna start at zero, one, two,

00:00:20.118 --> 00:00:30.213
three, four, five, six,
seven. eight, and nine,

00:00:30.213 --> 00:00:32.233
and instead of, of course we
know the next number is 10,

00:00:32.233 --> 00:00:34.848
which I could write down
but instead of doing that

00:00:34.848 --> 00:00:37.703
I’m just going to copy
and paste all of this.

00:00:37.703 --> 00:00:43.876
So copy and paste all of that
and see what this does for us.

00:00:43.876 --> 00:00:46.693
So if I do that, how does that help us?

00:00:46.693 --> 00:00:48.547
Well we know the next number is 10,

00:00:48.547 --> 00:00:50.311
which one way to think about it is,

00:00:50.311 --> 00:00:52.652
it’s a one followed by a zero.

00:00:52.652 --> 00:00:53.786
What’s the number after that?

00:00:53.786 --> 00:00:56.715
Well it’s 11, which is
a one followed by a one.

00:00:56.715 --> 00:00:57.616
What’s the number after that?

00:00:57.616 --> 00:00:59.793
Well it’s a 12, which is
a one followed by a two,

00:00:59.793 --> 00:01:08.231
and then 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19.

00:01:08.231 --> 00:01:09.818
Well that was pretty neat.

00:01:09.818 --> 00:01:12.677
This next row of numbers
as I went from 10 to 19

00:01:12.677 --> 00:01:14.724
looked just like the first ones,

00:01:14.724 --> 00:01:16.766
so the 2nd number is the same in yellow,

00:01:16.766 --> 00:01:19.789
but then I added a purple
one to the front of it.

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:23.025
And one way to think about
it is, each of these numbers,

00:01:23.025 --> 00:01:27.441
the purple one that I
added, that represents 10.

00:01:27.441 --> 00:01:31.130
So 11 could be viewed as 10 plus one,

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:35.191
12 could be viewed as 10 plus two.

00:01:35.191 --> 00:01:37.768
Let’s see if this keeps working.

00:01:37.768 --> 00:01:40.607
So let’s take another row of numbers.

00:01:40.607 --> 00:01:43.419
So let’s take another
row , my original row,

00:01:43.419 --> 00:01:45.910
and what do I get to after 19?

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:51.174
Well of course after 19 we get to 20.

00:01:51.174 --> 00:02:03.507
So 20, two zero and then 21,
22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29.

00:02:03.507 --> 00:02:06.218
I think you might start
to see the pattern here.

00:02:06.218 --> 00:02:08.346
What are we gonna do for the next row?

00:02:08.346 --> 00:02:10.816
Well now we’re in the 30s.

00:02:10.816 --> 00:02:14.862
So the first number 30 is 30 plus zero,

00:02:14.862 --> 00:02:19.379
30 plus one, 30 plus two,
30 plus three which is 33,

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:26.220
34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39.

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.027
So just doing that I think
you already see the pattern.

00:02:29.027 --> 00:02:33.019
The number on the right we
keep going from zero, one, two,

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:34.295
three, four, five, six, seven,

00:02:34.295 --> 00:02:36.682
eight, nine, and then
the number on the left,

00:02:36.682 --> 00:02:40.046
if we’re between 10 and 19,
you’ll always have a one.

00:02:40.046 --> 00:02:42.386
If you’re between 20 and 29,
you’ll always have a two.

00:02:42.386 --> 00:02:46.626
If you’re between 30 and 39,
you’ll always have a three.

00:02:46.626 --> 00:02:48.247
Now how can I complete this

00:02:48.247 --> 00:02:51.026
going all the way to 99 pretty fast?

00:02:51.026 --> 00:02:53.588
Well let’s do that, so
that’s going to be my 40s,

00:02:53.588 --> 00:02:56.522
I haven’t written it out yet.

00:02:56.522 --> 00:03:02.036
That’s going to be my 50s,
this is going to be my 60s,

00:03:04.205 --> 00:03:13.484
70s, 80s, and then I have
my 90s right over here.

00:03:13.484 --> 00:03:18.954
And so this one we already said
this is going to be my 40s,

00:03:18.954 --> 00:03:24.074
this is going to be my
50s, this is going to be,

00:03:24.074 --> 00:03:27.785
I’m trying to make sure I
use all my colors, my 60s,

00:03:27.785 --> 00:03:33.315
this is going to be my 70s,
and then I have my 80s,

00:03:33.315 --> 00:03:39.452
and then of course I have
my, let me do a color that,

00:03:39.452 --> 00:03:42.540
I’ll re-use magenta, I’ll have my 90s.

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.971
So what if I woulda just take this,

00:03:44.971 --> 00:03:48.283
so let me just take this right over here,

00:03:48.283 --> 00:03:50.197
and copy and paste that.

00:03:50.197 --> 00:03:52.916
So copy, and then let me paste it.

00:03:52.916 --> 00:03:57.585
So now I have 41, 51, 61, 71, 81, and 91.

00:03:58.215 --> 00:04:03.196
Now I can do it over here,
42, 52, 62, 72, 82, and 92.

00:04:03.196 --> 00:04:07.126
And I can do it for each of
these, for each of these now.

00:04:07.126 --> 00:04:12.378
So that’s, now, 44,
54, 64, 74, 84, and 94.

00:04:12.378 --> 00:04:16.487
And so when I do that
we see the full pattern.

00:04:16.487 --> 00:04:19.930
We see the full pattern
and I’m almost done.

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:28.738
I’m almost done filling in
my numbers from zero to 99.

00:04:28.738 --> 00:04:34.461
49, 59,69,79,89,99 and if
we just wanna feel good,

00:04:34.461 --> 00:04:40.979
we could throw in, we
could throw in a 100,

00:04:40.979 --> 00:04:44.902
a 100 right over there.

00:04:44.902 --> 00:04:47.109
And you’ll see the pattern
still holds, we went from one,

00:04:47.109 --> 00:04:50.477
two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine,

00:04:50.477 --> 00:04:55.123
and now we got to 10 followed by a zero.

00:04:55.123 --> 00:04:57.470
That was pretty neat.
