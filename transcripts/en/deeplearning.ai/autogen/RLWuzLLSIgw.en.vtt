ten thousand words in the vocabulary and

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180
ten thousand words in the vocabulary and
 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.450

to simplify the problem a bit I'm going

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460
to simplify the problem a bit I'm going
 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.459
to simplify the problem a bit I'm going
to ignore capitalization so I'm just

the first step of beam search or use

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420
the first step of beam search or use
 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.750
the first step of beam search or use
this network fragment with the encoder

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760
this network fragment with the encoder
 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.250

in purple to try to evaluate what is the
 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.440
in purple to try to evaluate what is the
probability of that first word so what's

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450
probability of that first word so what's
 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.359
probability of that first word so what's
the probability of the first output Y

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369
the probability of the first output Y
 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.450

given the input sentence x given the

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460
given the input sentence x given the
 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.539
given the input sentence x given the
French input so we're as greedy search

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549
French input so we're as greedy search
 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.120
French input so we're as greedy search
will pick only the one most likely words

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130
will pick only the one most likely words
 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.300
will pick only the one most likely words
and move on beam search instead can

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310
and move on beam search instead can
 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.910
and move on beam search instead can
consider multiple alternatives so the

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920
consider multiple alternatives so the
 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.350
consider multiple alternatives so the
beam search algorithm has a parameter

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360
beam search algorithm has a parameter
 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.660
beam search algorithm has a parameter
called B which is called the beam width

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670
called B which is called the beam width
 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.660
called B which is called the beam width
and for this example I'm gonna set the

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670
and for this example I'm gonna set the
 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.539
and for this example I'm gonna set the
beam width to be equal to three and what

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549
beam width to be equal to three and what
 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.039
beam width to be equal to three and what
this means this beam search because

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049
this means this beam search because
 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.810
this means this beam search because
they're not just one possibility but

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820
they're not just one possibility but
 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.600
they're not just one possibility but
consider three at a time so in

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610
consider three at a time so in
 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.090
consider three at a time so in
particular let's say evaluating this

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100
particular let's say evaluating this
 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.160
particular let's say evaluating this
probability over different choices the

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170
probability over different choices the
 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.359
probability over different choices the
first word it finds that the choices in

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:52.369
first word it finds that the choices in
 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:56.690
first word it finds that the choices in
Jane and September are the most likely

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700
Jane and September are the most likely
 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.539
Jane and September are the most likely
three possibilities for the first words

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549
three possibilities for the first words
 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:02.060
three possibilities for the first words
in the English output then beam search

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070
in the English output then beam search
 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.819
in the English output then beam search
will store away in computer memory that

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829
will store away in computer memory that
 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:07.069
will store away in computer memory that
it wants to try out all three of these

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079
it wants to try out all three of these
 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.830
it wants to try out all three of these
words and if the beam with parameter was

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840
words and if the beam with parameter was
 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.029
words and if the beam with parameter was
said differently if the beam width

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039
said differently if the beam width
 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.740
said differently if the beam width
parameter was say 10

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750
parameter was say 10
 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.840
parameter was say 10
then we keep track of not just three but

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:14.850
then we keep track of not just three but
 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:17.390
then we keep track of not just three but
of the ten most likely possible choices

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400
of the ten most likely possible choices
 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.030
of the ten most likely possible choices
for the first word so to be clear in

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040
for the first word so to be clear in
 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.090

order to perform this first step of beam

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100
order to perform this first step of beam
 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:25.250
order to perform this first step of beam
search what you need to do is run the

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260
search what you need to do is run the
 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:26.870
search what you need to do is run the
input French sentence through this

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880
input French sentence through this
 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.900
input French sentence through this
encoder network and then this first step

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910
encoder network and then this first step
 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.480
encoder network and then this first step
of the decoder network if this is a soft

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:32.490
of the decoder network if this is a soft
 

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:35.110

max output over all 10,000 possibilities
 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.510
max output over all 10,000 possibilities
then you would take those 10,000

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520
then you would take those 10,000
 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:42.260
then you would take those 10,000
possible outputs and keep in memory

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:42.270
possible outputs and keep in memory
 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:45.199
possible outputs and keep in memory
which were the top of the week let's go

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209
which were the top of the week let's go
 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:46.720
which were the top of the week let's go
on to the second step of beam search

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:46.730
on to the second step of beam search
 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:50.750
on to the second step of beam search
having picked in Jane and September as

having picked in Jane and September as
 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.940
having picked in Jane and September as
the three most likely choice of the

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950
the three most likely choice of the
 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:54.890
the three most likely choice of the
first word what beam search will do now

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900
first word what beam search will do now
 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.680
first word what beam search will do now
is for each of these three choices

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:56.690
is for each of these three choices
 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:59.150
is for each of these three choices
consider what should be the second word

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160
consider what should be the second word
 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.250
consider what should be the second word
so after in maybe the second word is a

the last word is Zulu so to evaluate the
 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:19.580
the last word is Zulu so to evaluate the
probability is second word it will use

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590
probability is second word it will use
 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.009

the decoder first outputs why that's one

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730
the decoder first outputs why that's one
 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:36.050
the decoder first outputs why that's one
so we're going to set to this y hat one

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060
so we're going to set to this y hat one
 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:39.229
so we're going to set to this y hat one
to the word in and feed this back in so

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239
to the word in and feed this back in so
 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:43.009
to the word in and feed this back in so
this is the words in because it decided

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:43.019
this is the words in because it decided
 

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:45.440
this is the words in because it decided
for now that because we're trying to

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450
for now that because we're trying to
 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:47.240
for now that because we're trying to
figure out it the first word was in what

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250
figure out it the first word was in what
 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:49.490
figure out it the first word was in what
is the second word and then this will

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500
is the second word and then this will
 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:54.259
is the second word and then this will
output yes Y hat too and so by

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:54.269
output yes Y hat too and so by
 

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:58.490
output yes Y hat too and so by
hardwiring y hat one here really the

and so if for each of the three words

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:53.650
and so if for each of the three words
 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:55.950
and so if for each of the three words
you've chosen in Jane and September

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:55.960
you've chosen in Jane and September
 

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:58.379
you've chosen in Jane and September
you've saved away this probability then

00:04:58.379 --> 00:04:58.389
you've saved away this probability then
 

00:04:58.389 --> 00:05:00.719
you've saved away this probability then
you can multiply them by this second

00:05:00.719 --> 00:05:00.729
you can multiply them by this second
 

00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:02.610
you can multiply them by this second
probability to get the probability of

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:02.620
probability to get the probability of
 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:06.059

the first and second words so now you've

00:05:06.059 --> 00:05:06.069
the first and second words so now you've
 

00:05:06.069 --> 00:05:08.610
the first and second words so now you've
seen how if the first word was in how

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:08.620
seen how if the first word was in how
 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:10.350

second words are in September or Jane is
 

00:07:53.319 --> 00:07:56.309
second words are in September or Jane is
or Jane visits then what that means is

00:07:56.309 --> 00:07:56.319
or Jane visits then what that means is
 

00:07:56.319 --> 00:07:59.749
or Jane visits then what that means is
that it is now rejecting September as a
