00:00:06.875 --> 00:00:10.453
There's a concept that's crucial
to chemistry and physics.

00:00:10.453 --> 00:00:15.293
It helps explain why physical processes
go one way and not the other:

00:00:15.293 --> 00:00:16.849
why ice melts,

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:19.279
why cream spreads in coffee,

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:22.529
why air leaks out of a punctured tire.

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.039
It's entropy, and it's notoriously
difficult to wrap our heads around.

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:31.879
Entropy is often described as
a measurement of disorder.

00:00:31.879 --> 00:00:35.739
That's a convenient image,
but it's unfortunately misleading.

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:38.511
For example, which is more disordered -

00:00:38.511 --> 00:00:43.469
a cup of crushed ice or a glass
of room temperature water?

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.373
Most people would say the ice,

00:00:45.373 --> 00:00:49.069
but that actually has lower entropy.

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:52.898
So here's another way of thinking
about it through probability.

00:00:52.898 --> 00:00:57.290
This may be trickier to understand,
but take the time to internalize it

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:01.260
and you'll have a much better 
understanding of entropy.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.661
Consider two small solids

00:01:03.661 --> 00:01:07.541
which are comprised 
of six atomic bonds each.

00:01:07.541 --> 00:01:12.781
In this model, the energy in each solid
is stored in the bonds.

00:01:12.781 --> 00:01:15.292
Those can be thought of 
as simple containers,

00:01:15.292 --> 00:01:20.070
which can hold indivisible units of energy
known as quanta.

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.601
The more energy a solid has,
the hotter it is.

00:01:24.601 --> 00:01:29.042
It turns out that there are numerous
ways that the energy can be distributed

00:01:29.042 --> 00:01:30.552
in the two solids

00:01:30.552 --> 00:01:34.592
and still have the same 
total energy in each.

00:01:34.592 --> 00:01:38.502
Each of these options 
is called a microstate.

00:01:38.502 --> 00:01:43.341
For six quanta of energy in Solid A
and two in Solid B,

00:01:43.341 --> 00:01:47.832
there are 9,702 microstates.

00:01:47.832 --> 00:01:52.861
Of course, there are other ways our eight
quanta of energy can be arranged.

00:01:52.861 --> 00:01:57.833
For example, all of the energy
could be in Solid A and none in B,

00:01:57.833 --> 00:02:00.872
or half in A and half in B.

00:02:00.872 --> 00:02:04.154
If we assume that each microstate
is equally likely,

00:02:04.154 --> 00:02:06.794
we can see that some of the energy
configurations

00:02:06.794 --> 00:02:10.543
have a higher probability of occurring
than others.

00:02:10.543 --> 00:02:14.184
That's due to their greater number
of microstates.

00:02:14.184 --> 00:02:20.143
Entropy is a direct measure of each
energy configuration's probability.

00:02:20.143 --> 00:02:23.193
What we see is that the energy
configuration

00:02:23.193 --> 00:02:26.843
in which the energy
is most spread out between the solids

00:02:26.843 --> 00:02:28.924
has the highest entropy.

00:02:28.924 --> 00:02:30.474
So in a general sense,

00:02:30.474 --> 00:02:34.853
entropy can be thought of as a measurement
of this energy spread.

00:02:34.853 --> 00:02:37.893
Low entropy means 
the energy is concentrated.

00:02:37.893 --> 00:02:41.623
High entropy means it's spread out.

00:02:41.623 --> 00:02:45.765
To see why entropy is useful for
explaining spontaneous processes,

00:02:45.765 --> 00:02:48.075
like hot objects cooling down,

00:02:48.075 --> 00:02:52.434
we need to look at a dynamic system
where the energy moves.

00:02:52.434 --> 00:02:54.935
In reality, energy doesn't stay put.

00:02:54.935 --> 00:02:58.065
It continuously moves between 
neighboring bonds.

00:02:58.065 --> 00:03:00.206
As the energy moves,

00:03:00.206 --> 00:03:02.955
the energy configuration can change.

00:03:02.955 --> 00:03:05.085
Because of the distribution 
of microstates,

00:03:05.085 --> 00:03:09.836
there's a 21% chance that the system
will later be in the configuration

00:03:09.836 --> 00:03:13.595
in which the energy is maximally 
spread out,

00:03:13.595 --> 00:03:17.357
there's a 13% chance that it will
return to its starting point,

00:03:17.357 --> 00:03:22.857
and an 8% chance that A will actually
gain energy.

00:03:22.857 --> 00:03:26.935
Again, we see that because there are
more ways to have dispersed energy

00:03:26.935 --> 00:03:30.026
and high entropy than concentrated energy,

00:03:30.026 --> 00:03:32.558
the energy tends to spread out.

00:03:32.558 --> 00:03:35.509
That's why if you put a hot object
next to a cold one,

00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:40.420
the cold one will warm up
and the hot one will cool down.

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:41.867
But even in that example,

00:03:41.867 --> 00:03:47.116
there is an 8% chance that the hot object
would get hotter.

00:03:47.116 --> 00:03:51.427
Why doesn't this ever happen
in real life?

00:03:51.427 --> 00:03:54.177
It's all about the size of the system.

00:03:54.177 --> 00:03:58.057
Our hypothetical solids only had
six bonds each.

00:03:58.057 --> 00:04:03.938
Let's scale the solids up to 6,000 bonds
and 8,000 units of energy,

00:04:03.938 --> 00:04:07.527
and again start the system with
three-quarters of the energy in A

00:04:07.527 --> 00:04:10.127
and one-quarter in B.

00:04:10.127 --> 00:04:14.337
Now we find that chance of A
spontaneously acquiring more energy

00:04:14.337 --> 00:04:17.247
is this tiny number.

00:04:17.247 --> 00:04:22.308
Familiar, everyday objects have many, many
times more particles than this.

00:04:22.308 --> 00:04:25.920
The chance of a hot object 
in the real world getting hotter

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:28.011
is so absurdly small,

00:04:28.011 --> 00:04:30.409
it just never happens.

00:04:30.409 --> 00:04:31.528
Ice melts,

00:04:31.528 --> 00:04:32.918
cream mixes in,

00:04:32.918 --> 00:04:34.676
and tires deflate

00:04:34.676 --> 00:04:39.942
because these states have more
dispersed energy than the originals.

00:04:39.942 --> 00:04:43.630
There's no mysterious force
nudging the system towards higher entropy.

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:48.928
It's just that higher entropy is always
statistically more likely.

00:04:48.928 --> 00:04:52.480
That's why entropy has been called
time's arrow.

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:56.739
If energy has the opportunity
to spread out, it will.
