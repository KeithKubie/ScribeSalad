Osinga: Hello, everyone.

00:00:01.801 --> 00:00:03.834
Hi.
[laughs]

00:00:03.834 --> 00:00:06.334
Um...whoa.
This is a little loud.

00:00:06.334 --> 00:00:10.934
Welcome to the API talk,
the talk where we explain

00:00:10.934 --> 00:00:14.467
how you can program
for and with Wave,

00:00:14.467 --> 00:00:17.434
how you can build applications
that interact with Wave.

00:00:17.434 --> 00:00:20.400
Before I get started,
I'd like to remind you

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.701
that you can put feedback
on this presentation

00:00:23.701 --> 00:00:26.834
on www.haveasec.com/io.

00:00:26.834 --> 00:00:31.467
And we'd really appreciate that
if you do that.

00:00:31.467 --> 00:00:35.567
So, um...
yeah, let's get started.

00:00:38.901 --> 00:00:42.033
There we go.
So yeah.

00:00:45.567 --> 00:00:48.000
As I cannot stress enough,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.033
this is a developer preview.

00:00:52.033 --> 00:00:58.033
We'll start giving out accounts
on wavesandbox.com, um...

00:00:58.033 --> 00:01:02.033
anywhere from now
and next week or so.

00:01:02.033 --> 00:01:05.634
You're all invited to explore
Google Docs

00:01:05.634 --> 00:01:07.400
with the API descriptions
on them.

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.400
They should be live already.

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.901
Also we have a blog site
that gives you more information.

00:01:13.901 --> 00:01:17.200
And you'll get an email
at some point

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.534
with instructions
as to how to sign into

00:01:19.534 --> 00:01:23.033
this wavesandbox.com domain

00:01:23.033 --> 00:01:25.200
where you'll find the client

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.868
that you saw in the
demonstration this morning,

00:01:28.868 --> 00:01:31.701
and that should allow you to...

00:01:31.701 --> 00:01:33.934
interact with using, you know,
building robots

00:01:33.934 --> 00:01:38.334
and extensions and all
that sort of goodness.

00:01:38.334 --> 00:01:42.067
Yeah.
So...Wave building.

00:01:42.067 --> 00:01:47.400
This is...
the Wave Building in Australia.

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:51.400
I, um, I'm personally
always a fan of building slides

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:53.334
that have mostly
a picture in them,

00:01:53.334 --> 00:01:55.000
and then I tell the story
about it.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.334
But I was told that

00:01:56.334 --> 00:01:58.367
I couldn't do that
for this presentation

00:01:58.367 --> 00:02:01.067
since people would be looking
at the presentation afterwards.

00:02:01.067 --> 00:02:03.667
This is sort of like the only
reminder that they have.

00:02:03.667 --> 00:02:05.400
It's fitting because,
you know,

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.367
we're talking about how you can
build stuff on top of Wave,

00:02:08.367 --> 00:02:11.000
and our team
is based in Australia.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.567
So I thought
I'd slip it in anyway.

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:18.834
So before you get--

00:02:18.834 --> 00:02:21.367
do a dive into
the various APIs that we have,

00:02:21.367 --> 00:02:23.934
I thought it might be
a good idea to take a moment

00:02:23.934 --> 00:02:26.267
and look at what a Wave is

00:02:26.267 --> 00:02:28.634
from an architectural
perspective,

00:02:28.634 --> 00:02:30.400
other than the pretty pictures

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.300
that Lars showed you
this morning.

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:36.801
So a Wave is actually...
not much.

00:02:36.801 --> 00:02:39.367
It's an envelope
that has wavelets in them

00:02:39.367 --> 00:02:41.334
for the physicist under you,
that might be--

00:02:41.334 --> 00:02:42.901
physics students under you,

00:02:42.901 --> 00:02:44.367
that might be
a little confusing,

00:02:44.367 --> 00:02:45.634
because wavelets
are already used

00:02:45.634 --> 00:02:47.667
for something else there too.

00:02:47.667 --> 00:02:49.534
Hey, what can I say?

00:02:49.534 --> 00:02:54.167
So essentially,
a wavelet is a complete Wave

00:02:54.167 --> 00:02:56.367
and has participants on them.

00:02:56.367 --> 00:02:59.334
And the reason that we split
waves up in wavelets

00:02:59.334 --> 00:03:01.200
is to manage permissions.

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:02.634
So each wavelet--

00:03:02.634 --> 00:03:05.334
each wavelet
has the same permissions,

00:03:05.334 --> 00:03:07.667
and the permissions are usually
assigned to the participants.

00:03:07.667 --> 00:03:09.901
So in this case,
we have one Wave...

00:03:09.901 --> 00:03:12.133
with the top thing
has five participants

00:03:12.133 --> 00:03:15.100
and, you know, there's some sort
of discussion going on there

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:19.067
about what to get for
food this evening.

00:03:19.067 --> 00:03:21.000
And then you can see
the second wavelet,

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.667
which has a subset
of the participant

00:03:22.667 --> 00:03:24.367
of the first ones on it.

00:03:24.367 --> 00:03:26.100
And there you see that,
you know,

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:28.367
these two guys think that,
actually...

00:03:28.367 --> 00:03:31.200
you know, let's not get pizza,
have to get Mexican food.

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:34.667
So to the clients, this will
look like a private reply,

00:03:34.667 --> 00:03:38.200
as you might remember
from the demo this morning.

00:03:41.934 --> 00:03:47.033
Now, we have two types
of APIs and, um,

00:03:47.033 --> 00:03:48.534
the first one is embedding.

00:03:48.534 --> 00:03:51.767
The second one is extensions.

00:03:51.767 --> 00:03:54.400
I like to say that,
you know, with embedding,

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.234
you can take Wave
and put it out in the world.

00:03:57.234 --> 00:03:59.467
And with extensions,
you can take bits of the world

00:03:59.467 --> 00:04:00.901
and put it in Wave.

00:04:00.901 --> 00:04:04.667
So the embedding API is...

00:04:04.667 --> 00:04:07.734
is much inspired
on the Google Maps API

00:04:07.734 --> 00:04:11.400
and lets you take a Wave
that you have

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.767
and display it
on your website.

00:04:13.767 --> 00:04:18.701
This is a very simple schema
describing that.

00:04:18.701 --> 00:04:22.834
So this is a, supposedly,
chess site

00:04:22.834 --> 00:04:26.868
where we have a tiny bit
of script include,

00:04:26.868 --> 00:04:29.234
which is the library
that we provide,

00:04:29.234 --> 00:04:30.934
that you put on
your website.

00:04:30.934 --> 00:04:34.601
You then tell this,
you know, what to do

00:04:34.601 --> 00:04:36.367
and in reaction to that,

00:04:36.367 --> 00:04:38.901
that piece of script
goes to ahead

00:04:38.901 --> 00:04:42.534
and essentially, it's a complete
version of our client

00:04:42.534 --> 00:04:44.567
minus all the chrome
around it.

00:04:44.567 --> 00:04:47.300
And that thing lives
in an iframe

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:49.501
and communicates
with the Wave Server

00:04:49.501 --> 00:04:50.934
so that you get
all the liveness

00:04:50.934 --> 00:04:54.200
and all that sort of thing
for free.

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:56.601
I have to say that the API

00:04:56.601 --> 00:04:58.501
that we're going
live with right now

00:04:58.501 --> 00:05:00.667
is fairly restricted.

00:05:00.667 --> 00:05:02.200
We're still working on this,

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:05.067
and over the coming
weeks or months,

00:05:05.067 --> 00:05:06.767
we hope that we can expand it

00:05:06.767 --> 00:05:08.667
and to make
a lot more possible.

00:05:08.667 --> 00:05:11.167
So right now
you can load a Wave.

00:05:11.167 --> 00:05:12.801
You can set
the UI configuration

00:05:12.801 --> 00:05:15.000
of, you know, how you
want to display that Wave.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.100
You can add a reply,
and you can follow.

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:20.267
Now, these last two things
need a little explanation,

00:05:20.267 --> 00:05:22.000
because actually,
what they do

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.868
is they let the page
that you embed the Wave on

00:05:24.868 --> 00:05:30.834
request the Wave client
that sits in that page

00:05:30.834 --> 00:05:34.100
to add the current user
to that Wave

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:35.968
so that the current user
follows that Wave

00:05:35.968 --> 00:05:38.434
or requests the current user

00:05:38.434 --> 00:05:41.200
to create a reply
inside of that Wave.

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:43.200
So this way you can,
as a developer,

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:44.934
you put a little button on there
saying reply.

00:05:44.934 --> 00:05:46.567
And what happens, in fact,

00:05:46.567 --> 00:05:49.968
is that the person that is
logged into the Wave client

00:05:49.968 --> 00:05:53.000
replies by clicking that.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.334
So here's a bit
of a example code...

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:05.033
of how that works in...
practice.

00:06:05.033 --> 00:06:07.234
So we start by having--

00:06:07.234 --> 00:06:09.434
Oh! I did not know
that would happen.

00:06:09.434 --> 00:06:12.200
So here on the top--
I wish I had a pointer.

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:14.968
We have pointers?
No pointers.

00:06:14.968 --> 00:06:16.534
And I can't select it,

00:06:16.534 --> 00:06:18.067
because then I go
to the next slide.

00:06:18.067 --> 00:06:21.067
So here on the top,
we have a waveframe

00:06:21.067 --> 00:06:23.334
that is just a div

00:06:23.334 --> 00:06:26.200
saying like it's 500 pixels
width--500 pixels high,

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:28.968
and it's, you know,
the entire width of the page.

00:06:28.968 --> 00:06:31.701
We include
the bit of JavaScript here

00:06:31.701 --> 00:06:35.634
from this bit of temporary URL
that we're currently using.

00:06:35.634 --> 00:06:38.133
We're working on getting
something better,

00:06:38.133 --> 00:06:40.667
but in the haste
to get to this event,

00:06:40.667 --> 00:06:43.501
it took us a little while
to get there.

00:06:43.501 --> 00:06:47.267
So...and then we go ahead
and we create a Wave panel.

00:06:47.267 --> 00:06:49.467
We request this Wave panel
to be hosted

00:06:49.467 --> 00:06:52.801
on the Wave Sandbox thing

00:06:52.801 --> 00:06:54.334
as we...you know,

00:06:54.334 --> 00:06:56.501
once we get to the point
where we have a public launch,

00:06:56.501 --> 00:06:58.367
we'd no longer
have to specify that,

00:06:58.367 --> 00:07:00.300
because then it would
just be the global thing.

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:03.033
But right now it's only for
the developer preview,

00:07:03.033 --> 00:07:04.767
so you only get that bit.

00:07:04.767 --> 00:07:09.734
And here we get the hairy bit
of the API, load Wave,

00:07:09.734 --> 00:07:15.200
and you do that by specifying
a Wave ID.

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:19.167
There's ways around
to get the right Wave ID.

00:07:19.167 --> 00:07:20.534
I'll get to that.

00:07:20.534 --> 00:07:22.834
And now we go ahead and we
fill the Wave panel to init

00:07:22.834 --> 00:07:26.934
and to put its work
on this URL here.

00:07:26.934 --> 00:07:32.334
So...in practice,
that looks like this thing here,

00:07:32.334 --> 00:07:35.734
which is the same source code
as I just showed.

00:07:35.734 --> 00:07:37.901
And if I double-click
that thing,

00:07:37.901 --> 00:07:42.100
it will go ahead...
with a little luck

00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:43.367
load a Wave.

00:07:43.367 --> 00:07:45.601
So this is a Wave
that is live on the thing,

00:07:45.601 --> 00:07:47.067
and it looks just like
a normal web page,

00:07:47.067 --> 00:07:49.334
but if I hover over it,
I can just, you know,

00:07:49.334 --> 00:07:52.934
go ahead and I can actually
reply to this thing.

00:07:55.434 --> 00:08:00.467
So that's as simple as...
as that...as embedding is.

00:08:00.467 --> 00:08:04.067
Now we have...added--

00:08:04.067 --> 00:08:06.067
like I said,
there's a few more things

00:08:06.067 --> 00:08:08.033
that you can do with embedding.

00:08:08.033 --> 00:08:09.534
Um...

00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:14.968
Here I added a button
to leave a comment,

00:08:14.968 --> 00:08:19.167
and I decided not to go with
the default styling

00:08:19.167 --> 00:08:22.434
but choose for
a black background

00:08:22.434 --> 00:08:24.534
and red lettering
and courier new

00:08:24.534 --> 00:08:27.334
to give it a nice
aggressive look.

00:08:27.334 --> 00:08:28.968
'Cause, you know,
that's always good

00:08:28.968 --> 00:08:31.534
for this sort of
pubic demonstrations.

00:08:31.534 --> 00:08:35.534
So if you load that one,
you get...

00:08:39.267 --> 00:08:41.334
Tch. Ta-da.

00:08:41.334 --> 00:08:43.534
So it's the same--
it's the same blog.

00:08:43.534 --> 00:08:45.667
And I can, you know,
I have--

00:08:45.667 --> 00:08:48.701
you can see this
in the Wave client too.

00:08:48.701 --> 00:08:50.601
You can see that the reply
that I just made

00:08:50.601 --> 00:08:52.601
is here and here's
the add comment button

00:08:52.601 --> 00:08:54.934
that would do
essentially the same thing

00:08:54.934 --> 00:08:57.334
as, uh, as before.

00:08:57.334 --> 00:08:58.801
Going back
to the presentation.

00:08:58.801 --> 00:09:00.834
So that is the--

00:09:00.834 --> 00:09:03.067
this is where we are
with embedding.

00:09:03.067 --> 00:09:07.834
Ooh, yeah.

00:09:07.834 --> 00:09:09.267
We have a little preview,

00:09:09.267 --> 00:09:11.400
developer stuff inside
of Google, of course, too,

00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:12.968
and somebody came up with

00:09:12.968 --> 00:09:15.501
this really nifty application
of embedding

00:09:15.501 --> 00:09:19.400
where he, uh, has taken
a normal gadget

00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:21.868
and put the embedding code
inside of the Google Gadget.

00:09:21.868 --> 00:09:25.234
So now you have this thing
that allows you

00:09:25.234 --> 00:09:27.834
to take a Google Wave
and put it on any website

00:09:27.834 --> 00:09:30.834
that supports gadgets
in a very simple way.

00:09:30.834 --> 00:09:33.467
And this also has the advantage
that, you know,

00:09:33.467 --> 00:09:35.834
he came up with a whole bunch
of user preferences

00:09:35.834 --> 00:09:37.367
that lets you configure

00:09:37.367 --> 00:09:39.067
the way that the Wave
looks in your thing.

00:09:39.067 --> 00:09:41.267
So instead of having to do
all the JavaScript yourself,

00:09:41.267 --> 00:09:44.033
you can just, you know
go ahead, insert the gadget,

00:09:44.033 --> 00:09:46.033
and now you get this
nice little diagram

00:09:46.033 --> 00:09:47.801
and, you know,
you click submit,

00:09:47.801 --> 00:09:50.634
and you get this Wave
on your iGoogle page.

00:09:50.634 --> 00:09:52.901
So if you would, you know,

00:09:52.901 --> 00:09:56.734
have your team meeting notes
in Google Wave

00:09:56.734 --> 00:10:00.300
but you normally use
iGoogle to start your day

00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:03.033
then you could, you know,
put that Wave in iGoogle

00:10:03.033 --> 00:10:05.501
and type directly there
to Wave or, you know,

00:10:05.501 --> 00:10:07.734
go to the Wave
client from there.

00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:14.234
In the demo you saw, um,

00:10:14.234 --> 00:10:19.868
how we used the embedding API
to extend Orkut.

00:10:19.868 --> 00:10:23.367
I hope I don't disappoint you
too much that, uh,

00:10:23.367 --> 00:10:26.100
we're not quite ready
to release that bit of the API

00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:27.734
that makes that possible.

00:10:27.734 --> 00:10:31.434
There are some security things
there that keep us from that.

00:10:31.434 --> 00:10:35.801
But we have a ambition
to make it completely possible

00:10:35.801 --> 00:10:38.767
to...essentially
build your own--

00:10:38.767 --> 00:10:42.567
assemble your own Wave client
using the embedding API

00:10:42.567 --> 00:10:46.367
and to go as far as
make it possible to embed waves

00:10:46.367 --> 00:10:49.834
that let your users
communicate with each other

00:10:49.834 --> 00:10:53.834
using Wave with their own
sort of database of waves

00:10:53.834 --> 00:10:56.534
without requiring your users
to log into Google,

00:10:56.534 --> 00:10:59.200
which is one of the things
that we currently do.

00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:04.167
So that we'll make it possible
to just take Wave

00:11:04.167 --> 00:11:06.467
and use it
for your applications,

00:11:06.467 --> 00:11:08.300
and, you know,
people will never have to

00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:11.901
first sign up
for whatever service we have.

00:11:11.901 --> 00:11:13.534
Okay...

00:11:17.100 --> 00:11:19.901
That brings us
to the bigger part of our API,

00:11:19.901 --> 00:11:21.434
extensions.

00:11:21.434 --> 00:11:26.667
So extensions are
the things that, uh,

00:11:26.667 --> 00:11:30.300
let you, as a developer,
extend Wave.

00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:32.801
Currently, we have two
types of extensions.

00:11:32.801 --> 00:11:35.033
We have robot and gadgets,

00:11:35.033 --> 00:11:40.167
and, um, the distinction is...

00:11:40.167 --> 00:11:42.133
really that a robot
runs on a server

00:11:42.133 --> 00:11:44.033
and a gadget runs
on a client.

00:11:44.033 --> 00:11:45.767
It still often gets
confusing,

00:11:45.767 --> 00:11:47.400
so hence this little
explanation here.

00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:50.701
So a robot runs in the server,
runs in the cloud,

00:11:50.701 --> 00:11:52.868
and talks to our Wave Server
directly.

00:11:52.868 --> 00:11:55.968
And so it communicates
by the user, with the user

00:11:55.968 --> 00:11:57.934
by manipulating the Wave,

00:11:57.934 --> 00:12:00.167
and then the user
can manipulate the Wave back,

00:12:00.167 --> 00:12:01.968
and that way,
they communicate.

00:12:01.968 --> 00:12:06.467
While a gadget is just a normal
open social type of gadget

00:12:06.467 --> 00:12:09.100
that gets extentiated
inside of our client

00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:11.567
and that can talk
directly to the user

00:12:11.567 --> 00:12:13.133
because it has
a bit of the screen.

00:12:13.133 --> 00:12:15.667
And it can store its state
in the Wave,

00:12:15.667 --> 00:12:19.868
so if you have a gadget
that is on a Wave

00:12:19.868 --> 00:12:22.834
that is being viewed
by five people at the same time,

00:12:22.834 --> 00:12:25.000
then those five people
each have their own instance

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.868
of this gadget.

00:12:28.868 --> 00:12:34.734
So, let's talk a little bit
more about, um, gadgets.

00:12:34.734 --> 00:12:39.501
So here's the...
the basic model...

00:12:39.501 --> 00:12:41.501
of gadgets.

00:12:41.501 --> 00:12:45.334
We have this page,
LS Wave client

00:12:45.334 --> 00:12:48.100
which shows the user
what it is.

00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:51.634
And it maintains
an XML document

00:12:51.634 --> 00:12:54.200
that is the entire state
of that Wave.

00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:57.067
And any time you do something
to do the Wave

00:12:57.067 --> 00:12:58.834
using the Wave client,

00:12:58.834 --> 00:13:00.567
it looks like
you're manipulating the HML.

00:13:00.567 --> 00:13:02.200
But in the background we,
you know,

00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:03.634
manipulate the XML documents.

00:13:03.634 --> 00:13:05.667
And if you make a change,

00:13:05.667 --> 00:13:07.868
then the client calculates
the change that you made

00:13:07.868 --> 00:13:12.434
since this diff or op over
the wire to the Wave Server--

00:13:12.434 --> 00:13:14.300
The Wave Server
applies that to the, you know,

00:13:14.300 --> 00:13:18.033
to the actual
canonical version of the Wave...

00:13:18.033 --> 00:13:20.234
takes into account of all
the changes of the other people

00:13:20.234 --> 00:13:22.234
and then sends back
the operations

00:13:22.234 --> 00:13:24.434
that bring the client
in sync

00:13:24.434 --> 00:13:26.267
with the canonical version.

00:13:26.267 --> 00:13:29.234
So that's, you know,
very briefly how our...

00:13:29.234 --> 00:13:31.167
how our collaboration thing
works.

00:13:31.167 --> 00:13:32.834
If you want the details,

00:13:32.834 --> 00:13:37.434
we have a talk at 2:15,
I think, with a--

00:13:37.434 --> 00:13:40.234
where we take
a much deeper dive

00:13:40.234 --> 00:13:43.634
into, you know,
the technology behind this.

00:13:43.634 --> 00:13:45.834
For gadgets, this is really
all you need to know.

00:13:45.834 --> 00:13:47.434
So this gadget
sits in its iframe,

00:13:47.434 --> 00:13:49.400
and it can do
whatever gadgets can do,

00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:52.734
But we have this nice
little library

00:13:52.734 --> 00:13:56.634
that lets the gadget
make modifications

00:13:56.634 --> 00:13:58.434
to the XML document.

00:13:58.434 --> 00:14:01.267
For now, it can only change
one note in this XML document,

00:14:01.267 --> 00:14:05.067
and this is the--
well, its own gadget note

00:14:05.067 --> 00:14:07.133
where, essentially,

00:14:07.133 --> 00:14:10.834
all it gets to do is set
a bunch of key value pairs.

00:14:10.834 --> 00:14:13.734
But you can pretty much
represent any state

00:14:13.734 --> 00:14:15.934
in a list of key value pairs.

00:14:15.934 --> 00:14:19.467
So that's all good.

00:14:19.467 --> 00:14:23.400
Um...that API
that I was talking about

00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:25.534
basically has three bits.

00:14:25.534 --> 00:14:27.100
We have the Wave object.

00:14:27.100 --> 00:14:28.667
The Wave object
gives you access

00:14:28.667 --> 00:14:31.334
to the participants
on that Wave.

00:14:31.334 --> 00:14:33.701
It also gets you,
you know,

00:14:33.701 --> 00:14:35.834
gives you access
to the state object

00:14:35.834 --> 00:14:37.267
that I was talking about
before.

00:14:37.267 --> 00:14:42.033
Furthermore, we have
a thing called the mode.

00:14:42.033 --> 00:14:44.701
So the Wave can be
in a whole bunch of modes.

00:14:44.701 --> 00:14:47.100
The most important thing
is that

00:14:47.100 --> 00:14:50.200
sometimes you want to
distinguish what happens to--

00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:53.501
how you display things,
whether you are in playback mode

00:14:53.501 --> 00:14:55.300
or whether you are
in edit mode.

00:14:55.300 --> 00:14:57.501
And the same for--

00:14:57.501 --> 00:14:59.634
although we don't support it
right now,

00:14:59.634 --> 00:15:02.467
but...remember
during your demo,

00:15:02.467 --> 00:15:04.167
if you go back to a Wave
that you have been,

00:15:04.167 --> 00:15:06.767
you see the differences
that were made last time.

00:15:06.767 --> 00:15:08.567
We want to support that
in gadgets too

00:15:08.567 --> 00:15:10.567
so that you write a chess game

00:15:10.567 --> 00:15:13.167
and you go back to a Wave
that has this chess game on it.

00:15:13.167 --> 00:15:14.567
You can show the user

00:15:14.567 --> 00:15:16.367
what happened
since last time he looked.

00:15:16.367 --> 00:15:17.767
So you can sort of show
all the arrows

00:15:17.767 --> 00:15:19.367
of all the pieces that moved.

00:15:19.367 --> 00:15:21.367
We think that is a very
powerful thing to do.

00:15:21.367 --> 00:15:26.167
So the state object
lets you submit deltas,

00:15:26.167 --> 00:15:29.767
and it lets you
query the state.

00:15:29.767 --> 00:15:32.434
And the way that work is

00:15:32.434 --> 00:15:34.501
you always submit
deltas to the state,

00:15:34.501 --> 00:15:37.167
and then you get called back
with this is the new state.

00:15:37.167 --> 00:15:38.801
The reason that we do this

00:15:38.801 --> 00:15:41.267
is that you're not the only one
modifying a state.

00:15:41.267 --> 00:15:43.167
So that way we guarantee

00:15:43.167 --> 00:15:45.067
that any time you get
called back with the state

00:15:45.067 --> 00:15:46.434
that it's actually the state

00:15:46.434 --> 00:15:49.467
and not something that
you think you would be creating.

00:15:49.467 --> 00:15:53.601
Last thing that we have
is the participant object.

00:15:56.367 --> 00:15:58.000
Participants
are anybody on the Wave,

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.667
including robots,
and we give you access for now

00:16:00.667 --> 00:16:04.667
to the name of the participant
and to the thumbnail URL.

00:16:04.667 --> 00:16:07.534
Well, let's have a look
at some actual code.

00:16:07.534 --> 00:16:09.567
This is just a reminder.

00:16:09.567 --> 00:16:11.601
Just for my sense,
how many people here

00:16:11.601 --> 00:16:16.434
have, uh, taken the time
to write a gadget before?

00:16:16.434 --> 00:16:20.100
Okay, well...
that's not too many.

00:16:20.100 --> 00:16:22.167
So this is a bare bone gadget.

00:16:22.167 --> 00:16:24.300
It's essentially
an XML document

00:16:24.300 --> 00:16:28.968
within the middle, uh,
a bit of HTML here and...

00:16:28.968 --> 00:16:31.234
it tells...

00:16:31.234 --> 00:16:33.300
you send this
to the gadget server

00:16:33.300 --> 00:16:36.400
and it configures a iframe
for you from a perspective.

00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:40.067
And so if you would load
this gadget

00:16:40.067 --> 00:16:43.968
inside of a iGoogle
or whatever,

00:16:43.968 --> 00:16:46.467
you would just see
Hello Wave--this thing here.

00:16:46.467 --> 00:16:48.434
'Cause that's really
all it does.

00:16:48.434 --> 00:16:50.000
So that's not very interesting.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.167
And I'm not going even
to show you this,

00:16:52.167 --> 00:16:53.868
because it's not much
of a demo.

00:16:53.868 --> 00:16:57.167
One thing I learned from Lars
is that, you know,

00:16:57.167 --> 00:16:59.601
if you want to make a nice demo,
throw in a map.

00:16:59.601 --> 00:17:02.100
[laughter]
So...

00:17:02.100 --> 00:17:05.033
That's what I did here.
It's the same gadget as before.

00:17:05.033 --> 00:17:07.400
But now what we do is,
you know,

00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:09.567
easy, easy Maps API.

00:17:09.567 --> 00:17:12.467
We create a map here,
set it on 3,500, 35,

00:17:12.467 --> 00:17:14.467
which is, you know, Japan.

00:17:14.467 --> 00:17:17.334
I--wrong number but so...

00:17:17.334 --> 00:17:20.367
now we can go to the Wave client
and uh--ooh.

00:17:20.367 --> 00:17:24.567
We can go to the Wave client...
and we can open that map.

00:17:24.567 --> 00:17:26.200
It's here.

00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:32.067
And with a little luck,
it will even load.

00:17:32.067 --> 00:17:34.467
Oh, come on!

00:17:46.267 --> 00:17:48.300
Well, I guess it's better
for me that it doesn't load

00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:50.300
than, you know,
this morning, but still...

00:17:50.300 --> 00:17:52.634
Seems unfortunate.

00:18:06.767 --> 00:18:09.167
Well, you know,
let's assume it loaded,

00:18:09.167 --> 00:18:13.767
then it would look like this.
[laughter]

00:18:13.767 --> 00:18:17.701
So the thing is that...

00:18:17.701 --> 00:18:18.701
ah, there we go.

00:18:18.701 --> 00:18:19.868
So the thing is this--

00:18:19.868 --> 00:18:21.167
this is a nice, you know,
it's a map.

00:18:21.167 --> 00:18:23.167
And you can move it around
and...you know.

00:18:23.167 --> 00:18:25.968
It shows that you can
basically take any gadget

00:18:25.968 --> 00:18:29.167
from the gadget galleries
that we have and...

00:18:29.167 --> 00:18:31.767
drop it into Wave and it will,
you know, it will play.

00:18:31.767 --> 00:18:33.367
So we have...you know...

00:18:33.367 --> 00:18:36.367
The thing though, is,
that if I move this map around

00:18:36.367 --> 00:18:38.400
and you're also looking
at this map,

00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:40.968
then, you know,
you see your own version.

00:18:40.968 --> 00:18:43.767
And if I...

00:18:43.767 --> 00:18:46.567
so, you know, if I focus
this thing on like Europe

00:18:46.567 --> 00:18:51.968
and then I go to a...
different Wave here...

00:18:51.968 --> 00:18:53.968
oh, man, this is not good

00:18:53.968 --> 00:18:55.567
that it loads so slowly.

00:18:55.567 --> 00:18:58.167
[man speaking indistinctly]
Osinga: Huh?

00:18:58.167 --> 00:19:00.968
[man repeats]

00:19:00.968 --> 00:19:03.834
Osinga: I know, but I'm supposed
to be on a special wired network

00:19:03.834 --> 00:19:06.033
that's much faster
than what you guys got.

00:19:06.033 --> 00:19:09.033
[laughter]

00:19:09.033 --> 00:19:10.968
Um...

00:19:13.634 --> 00:19:16.634
Anyway, so the point is
I go back to this Wave,

00:19:16.634 --> 00:19:18.434
and whoop--
now I'm back in Japan.

00:19:18.434 --> 00:19:19.834
It doesn't save its state.

00:19:19.834 --> 00:19:24.234
So we can use the...
the API...

00:19:24.234 --> 00:19:26.334
to do exactly that.

00:19:26.334 --> 00:19:29.868
So in the next slide,
what we did add here

00:19:29.868 --> 00:19:32.467
is a little...so now
we're getting to the point

00:19:32.467 --> 00:19:34.300
where, you know, unload.

00:19:34.300 --> 00:19:37.734
What we do is we say, well,
you know, set...

00:19:37.734 --> 00:19:41.200
take this set change--
interesting, it doesn't--

00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:43.601
It's called
a state changed method

00:19:43.601 --> 00:19:46.801
as soon as I--as soon as
the state of the gadget changed.

00:19:46.801 --> 00:19:48.834
And we add a listener
to the map.

00:19:48.834 --> 00:19:52.767
As soon as we're done with
the dragging of the map,

00:19:52.767 --> 00:19:54.300
we submit a delta

00:19:54.300 --> 00:19:56.968
saying that the key
latitude and the key longitude

00:19:56.968 --> 00:19:59.701
are now set to the latitude
and longitude of the map.

00:19:59.701 --> 00:20:03.434
And in the state changed,
we actually take the map

00:20:03.434 --> 00:20:07.767
and move it go
those keys from the state.

00:20:07.767 --> 00:20:09.801
The point here is that...

00:20:09.801 --> 00:20:12.434
this will execute on
all clients at the same time.

00:20:12.434 --> 00:20:14.434
So essentially
what we do here is

00:20:14.434 --> 00:20:16.033
if any of the...

00:20:16.033 --> 00:20:19.434
any user of any of those gadgets
moves that map around,

00:20:19.434 --> 00:20:22.234
then all the gadgets
get the state changed.

00:20:22.234 --> 00:20:23.834
So they will all, you know,

00:20:23.834 --> 00:20:26.634
synchronize
the move of the thing.

00:20:26.634 --> 00:20:30.133
And now, with a little
network luck,

00:20:30.133 --> 00:20:32.467
I can show you this other
version of the map.

00:20:57.367 --> 00:21:00.033
Uh...

00:21:00.033 --> 00:21:01.501
come on.

00:21:01.501 --> 00:21:03.467
Sorry about this.

00:21:03.467 --> 00:21:05.501
Okay, there we go.

00:21:05.501 --> 00:21:08.167
And I cleverly also
loaded this thing already

00:21:08.167 --> 00:21:09.501
in Firefox.

00:21:09.501 --> 00:21:12.868
And now if the connection
here didn't die...

00:21:12.868 --> 00:21:17.300
See? See, the network moves--
the map moves in the back.

00:21:17.300 --> 00:21:19.501
How cool is that?

00:21:19.501 --> 00:21:24.234
[applause]

00:21:24.234 --> 00:21:26.100
Yes. Should I switch off
the wireless?

00:21:26.100 --> 00:21:28.701
[woman speaking indistinctly]

00:21:28.701 --> 00:21:30.834
Osinga: Oh, off.
woman: Yes.

00:21:30.834 --> 00:21:32.200
Osinga:
Oh, yeah, I can do that.

00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:35.501
Maybe then I don't have
a connection at all, of course.

00:21:35.501 --> 00:21:37.701
[tittering]

00:21:37.701 --> 00:21:40.901
Okay, switching off
the thing now.

00:21:40.901 --> 00:21:45.267
All Wave radios are off...
ready for takeoff.

00:21:45.267 --> 00:21:47.501
Okay, so...
this is, of course, only using

00:21:47.501 --> 00:21:49.334
the state bit of the API.

00:21:49.334 --> 00:21:51.033
We also have
the participant API,

00:21:51.033 --> 00:21:52.767
so this looks like
a lot of code.

00:21:52.767 --> 00:21:56.868
If you add this bit of the code
to the same--

00:21:56.868 --> 00:22:00.067
so what I did here is
I added to the callback

00:22:00.067 --> 00:22:02.901
to also,
if the participants change,

00:22:02.901 --> 00:22:04.501
also call this function.

00:22:04.501 --> 00:22:06.067
So what we do here at the top is

00:22:06.067 --> 00:22:08.267
we go to the Wave and we ask for
all the participants.

00:22:08.267 --> 00:22:11.701
And then we look through
the participants and...

00:22:11.701 --> 00:22:16.767
for each of the participants,
we retrieve a key.

00:22:16.767 --> 00:22:18.601
And we use the participant ID
as the key

00:22:18.601 --> 00:22:20.901
so that each of the persons
on that Wave

00:22:20.901 --> 00:22:22.234
get their own key
in the state.

00:22:22.234 --> 00:22:23.567
So that way we make sure

00:22:23.567 --> 00:22:25.701
that they don't interfere
with each other.

00:22:25.701 --> 00:22:28.834
And for each of those,
we get these little string

00:22:28.834 --> 00:22:31.968
which is called ploc here,
you know, personal location.

00:22:31.968 --> 00:22:34.400
And this personal location,
um, I, you know,

00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:37.300
I could have used two strings
for the X and the Y coordinates.

00:22:37.300 --> 00:22:38.868
'Cause what we're trying
to do here is

00:22:38.868 --> 00:22:41.033
give each person on the Wave

00:22:41.033 --> 00:22:44.601
a little avatar that he can move
but nobody else can.

00:22:44.601 --> 00:22:49.467
So what we do is
we fetch the current cordinat--

00:22:49.467 --> 00:22:52.300
coordinates
from the participants,

00:22:52.300 --> 00:22:53.734
and if we don't have one,

00:22:53.734 --> 00:22:55.734
we put him in
somewhere in Africa.

00:22:55.734 --> 00:23:00.400
And then we construct
a marker.

00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:03.467
You know, it's an Earth Google
Maps marker

00:23:03.467 --> 00:23:07.200
using the getThumbnail method
on the participant.

00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:09.734
And we add it to the Wave.

00:23:09.734 --> 00:23:12.300
And the other thing that we do

00:23:12.300 --> 00:23:16.167
is we set the icon to draggable
so it can actually be moved.

00:23:16.167 --> 00:23:18.167
Then we attach a listener
to this thing

00:23:18.167 --> 00:23:21.601
that makes it possible
for, you know,

00:23:21.601 --> 00:23:23.901
the current user
to drag this thing around.

00:23:23.901 --> 00:23:25.501
We make it such that

00:23:25.501 --> 00:23:27.367
the [indistinct] are missing
a little bit.

00:23:27.367 --> 00:23:29.234
But if you're not
the current viewer,

00:23:29.234 --> 00:23:30.667
then you can't move
this thing around.

00:23:30.667 --> 00:23:33.100
So then with this bit
of participant code

00:23:33.100 --> 00:23:35.634
added to the gadget,

00:23:35.634 --> 00:23:42.267
we get a nice...

00:23:42.267 --> 00:23:43.968
[humming]

00:23:43.968 --> 00:23:45.467
the "where are you from?"

00:23:45.467 --> 00:23:48.501
So I added this to the...

00:23:48.501 --> 00:23:50.033
it does load faster.

00:23:50.033 --> 00:23:52.834
So I added this thing
with our team on it.

00:23:52.834 --> 00:23:55.334
You can see our team members.
Say hello.

00:23:55.334 --> 00:23:56.634
Thanks.

00:23:56.634 --> 00:23:59.634
And, you know, I asked them
to, you know,

00:23:59.634 --> 00:24:02.501
indicate where
they're from and...

00:24:02.501 --> 00:24:04.701
So, you know, they--

00:24:04.701 --> 00:24:06.901
everybody can pick up
their own--

00:24:06.901 --> 00:24:09.901
you can see here David jumping
around in the Atlantic.

00:24:09.901 --> 00:24:11.901
So that's...
kinda nice.

00:24:11.901 --> 00:24:15.501
So I can...
I can move my guy around

00:24:15.501 --> 00:24:17.100
to say, okay, I'm in Japan.

00:24:17.100 --> 00:24:18.701
So, you know,
it's just a...

00:24:18.701 --> 00:24:21.701
a cute little thing
where you have the shared state

00:24:21.701 --> 00:24:24.100
and you can see
how the gadget actually

00:24:24.100 --> 00:24:25.901
gets access
to the thing.

00:24:25.901 --> 00:24:30.100
Since I left
the move map around,

00:24:30.100 --> 00:24:33.300
I think we can even make it
so that David moved the map.

00:24:33.300 --> 00:24:35.100
David moved the map.

00:24:35.100 --> 00:24:40.100
Come on.

00:24:40.100 --> 00:24:43.734
See? No hands.
[chuckling]

00:24:43.734 --> 00:24:46.801
Anyway...

00:24:46.801 --> 00:24:49.300
so that's the...
the gadget bit.

00:24:49.300 --> 00:24:52.300
Here's a bunch of
example gadgets

00:24:52.300 --> 00:24:54.300
that we have written

00:24:54.300 --> 00:25:00.501
and that if the source code
is not on the Google.com site,

00:25:00.501 --> 00:25:02.567
then it should be
really soon.

00:25:02.567 --> 00:25:07.767
Here's the chess gadgets
that has...

00:25:07.767 --> 00:25:11.567
was shown in the demo
which nicely shows off--

00:25:11.567 --> 00:25:13.367
That's a good point
to make, actually.

00:25:13.367 --> 00:25:15.567
All these gadgets,
they share the state--

00:25:15.567 --> 00:25:17.567
they save the state
in the Wave.

00:25:17.567 --> 00:25:20.000
But by doing that they,
you know,

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:23.567
they obviously get to play
in the whole...

00:25:23.567 --> 00:25:24.968
synchronization
of the state,

00:25:24.968 --> 00:25:26.567
so they don't have
to take care of that.

00:25:26.567 --> 00:25:27.968
But the other thing
that they do

00:25:27.968 --> 00:25:30.167
is since we record
all the change through the Wave,

00:25:30.167 --> 00:25:33.501
you can automatically
just replay the thing.

00:25:33.501 --> 00:25:36.934
So I can just go
to any of those...

00:25:36.934 --> 00:25:39.133
waves that we have,
for example, this thing here,

00:25:39.133 --> 00:25:42.567
and I can put it
in playback mode.

00:25:42.567 --> 00:25:44.334
And, you know, you can see...

00:25:44.334 --> 00:25:47.968
I can just...
where everybody moved the map

00:25:47.968 --> 00:25:52.567
and when
and, you know, how.

00:25:52.567 --> 00:25:55.167
So that way, you get
this powerful playback thing

00:25:55.167 --> 00:25:57.300
and especially for games,
it's really neat

00:25:57.300 --> 00:25:59.567
because you can play a game
and then when you're done,

00:25:59.567 --> 00:26:01.634
you can just replay
and see where you went wrong.

00:26:01.634 --> 00:26:04.033
So that's, you know,
kind of cool,

00:26:04.033 --> 00:26:06.634
and you get it for free.

00:26:06.634 --> 00:26:09.234
Uh, sudoku was also
mentioned here.

00:26:09.234 --> 00:26:11.834
This is another--
here in the corner,

00:26:11.834 --> 00:26:13.434
it's probably hard to read,

00:26:13.434 --> 00:26:15.434
but it's another
cute little game

00:26:15.434 --> 00:26:18.234
where it's based
on this magnetic poetry thing.

00:26:18.234 --> 00:26:21.033
So you have a whole
bunch of words

00:26:21.033 --> 00:26:22.634
and you can just
drag them around.

00:26:22.634 --> 00:26:23.834
And if you add
a whole group of people,

00:26:23.834 --> 00:26:26.434
you can sort of collectively
create poems.

00:26:26.434 --> 00:26:28.834
It's, you know,
hours of fun

00:26:28.834 --> 00:26:30.634
for people
with nothing else to do.

00:26:30.634 --> 00:26:33.033
[laughter]

00:26:33.033 --> 00:26:34.634
People that do have
a lot to do here

00:26:34.634 --> 00:26:35.834
wrote this gadget
here in the corner

00:26:35.834 --> 00:26:37.834
which is, you know,

00:26:37.834 --> 00:26:39.834
we had one of those
late-night sessions

00:26:39.834 --> 00:26:42.434
and then at some point,
always the point appears.

00:26:42.434 --> 00:26:44.033
This is on the weekend and...

00:26:44.033 --> 00:26:46.834
apparently, there's no food
at Google in the weekend.

00:26:46.834 --> 00:26:49.434
So somebody, you know,
somebody will get hungry

00:26:49.434 --> 00:26:50.834
and somebody else
will get hungry

00:26:50.834 --> 00:26:52.434
and usually
the most hungry person

00:26:52.434 --> 00:26:55.434
then finally decides
to get food for everybody.

00:26:55.434 --> 00:26:58.234
And it's always hard
to figure out what to get.

00:26:58.234 --> 00:27:00.067
So somebody wrote
a little gadget

00:27:00.067 --> 00:27:02.901
that allows everybody
to add one line to the gadget

00:27:02.901 --> 00:27:05.701
from a bunch of menus
that he screen scraped

00:27:05.701 --> 00:27:07.100
from a bunch of websites

00:27:07.100 --> 00:27:10.501
of restaurants that
we could do the food run to.

00:27:10.501 --> 00:27:12.901
And so you can have this
whole discussion about the food

00:27:12.901 --> 00:27:15.100
and the top of this Wave
then automatically

00:27:15.100 --> 00:27:18.501
keeps track of a list of all
the things that we want to get

00:27:18.501 --> 00:27:21.534
and from which restaurants,
so it's very neat.

00:27:25.100 --> 00:27:29.667
Okay. So...
we get to the robot bit.

00:27:32.501 --> 00:27:34.801
One of the reasons that robots
are cooler than gadgets

00:27:34.801 --> 00:27:37.400
is that it just sounds
much cooler.

00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:39.200
[laughter]

00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:42.100
I mean, building a robot...

00:27:42.100 --> 00:27:44.667
who can say that,
that you do that for a job?

00:27:44.667 --> 00:27:46.334
Well, I can.

00:27:46.334 --> 00:27:49.334
Um, so robot sits sort of
on the other side of the thing.

00:27:49.334 --> 00:27:51.501
Here we have Carl's client,
in this case,

00:27:51.501 --> 00:27:53.434
and Carl's also looking
at a gadget here still,

00:27:53.434 --> 00:27:56.400
and this is the...
this is the XML documents

00:27:56.400 --> 00:27:58.100
that is kept by its client.

00:27:58.100 --> 00:28:00.234
And it's kept in sync
by the Wave Server.

00:28:00.234 --> 00:28:02.234
But the Wave Server
talks not just to clients.

00:28:02.234 --> 00:28:05.801
It also talks to a bunch
of agents that we have here.

00:28:05.801 --> 00:28:09.200
So Spelly and Linky
are sort of the robot agents

00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:11.033
that come with the system,

00:28:11.033 --> 00:28:13.067
and they are on all waves

00:28:13.067 --> 00:28:14.868
and they have another,
you know,

00:28:14.868 --> 00:28:17.033
they sort of have
direct access to everything.

00:28:17.033 --> 00:28:19.901
For these basic agents,
you really need that.

00:28:19.901 --> 00:28:21.767
So they're a little special.

00:28:21.767 --> 00:28:24.000
But in order to make it
as simple as possible

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:25.634
for everybody to build robots,

00:28:25.634 --> 00:28:28.400
we have also created
a robot proxy here.

00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:30.334
The robot proxy
also talks to the Wave Server

00:28:30.334 --> 00:28:32.033
and it talks
to the Wave protocol.

00:28:32.033 --> 00:28:35.267
What it does,
it takes the Wave protocol

00:28:35.267 --> 00:28:38.767
and it converts it
to HTTP calls.

00:28:38.767 --> 00:28:42.567
And we have
a adjacent format

00:28:42.567 --> 00:28:45.000
where we take
those HTTP calls.

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:47.200
We take basically
all operations

00:28:47.200 --> 00:28:48.701
that come from
the Wave Server

00:28:48.701 --> 00:28:50.501
that are interesting
for your robot

00:28:50.501 --> 00:28:52.901
and call out
to this HTTP server

00:28:52.901 --> 00:28:54.968
that is implementing
the robot interface

00:28:54.968 --> 00:28:57.367
with adjacent string
encoding those operations.

00:28:57.367 --> 00:29:01.834
And then, uh, that robot
returns the thing back.

00:29:01.834 --> 00:29:06.434
So this is essentially
the API that we have.

00:29:06.434 --> 00:29:07.834
We have a bunch of events.

00:29:07.834 --> 00:29:10.434
These are the things that,
as a robot, you can react to.

00:29:10.434 --> 00:29:11.834
And we have
a bunch of operations

00:29:11.834 --> 00:29:13.434
which are the things that,
as a robot,

00:29:13.434 --> 00:29:16.234
you can return to us
and, uh, to modify.

00:29:16.234 --> 00:29:20.200
Oh, one remark is
you can see here at the bottom

00:29:20.200 --> 00:29:22.200
that it calls out
to App Engine,

00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:24.701
and you might think
that's just Google propaganda.

00:29:24.701 --> 00:29:28.367
But for now,
we have restricted it

00:29:28.367 --> 00:29:30.267
to robots only
running in App Engine.

00:29:30.267 --> 00:29:33.968
There's a bunch of good
technical reasons for

00:29:33.968 --> 00:29:37.367
but as we progress,
we'll lift that restriction

00:29:37.367 --> 00:29:40.868
and make it possible to run
robots in any old server

00:29:40.868 --> 00:29:42.634
that you might have.

00:29:42.634 --> 00:29:46.667
So the...
robots have a model of the Wave,

00:29:46.667 --> 00:29:49.000
and robots have access
to the entire Wave,

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:51.400
not like gadgets
that only have access

00:29:51.400 --> 00:29:53.834
to the little bit
that they control.

00:29:53.834 --> 00:29:58.434
And the model is fairly similar
to the model I described before,

00:29:58.434 --> 00:30:00.667
except for that we have
simplified it a little bit

00:30:00.667 --> 00:30:05.434
so we--robots see, by default,
only the text in a Wave.

00:30:05.434 --> 00:30:07.334
It makes it a lot easier
to manipulate.

00:30:07.334 --> 00:30:10.868
And we sort of extract little
text bits from the XML document

00:30:10.868 --> 00:30:12.434
and create a TextView
out of that,

00:30:12.434 --> 00:30:14.033
and then if you modify
that TextView,

00:30:14.033 --> 00:30:16.033
we figure out what bits
you modified

00:30:16.033 --> 00:30:18.634
and throw it into
the whole OT stack

00:30:18.634 --> 00:30:21.734
and make sure that
it synchronizes nicely.

00:30:21.734 --> 00:30:24.234
And we have similar views
of these documents

00:30:24.234 --> 00:30:26.634
if you want to talk
to a gadget in the Wave

00:30:26.634 --> 00:30:28.434
or if you want to talk
to the forum.

00:30:28.434 --> 00:30:31.968
In terms of events...

00:30:31.968 --> 00:30:34.434
you can react to events
on three different levels.

00:30:34.434 --> 00:30:37.033
You can react on wavelets
where, you know,

00:30:37.033 --> 00:30:39.434
you can look whether
there's a blip created,

00:30:39.434 --> 00:30:42.067
participant changed,
or a title changed.

00:30:42.067 --> 00:30:44.567
And for the blips you can,
you know,

00:30:44.567 --> 00:30:47.234
essentially see what changed
in a specific blips

00:30:47.234 --> 00:30:51.434
or document
inside of a wavelet.

00:30:51.434 --> 00:30:55.334
And then we have right now
only one method for the forms--

00:30:55.334 --> 00:30:57.367
that is when a button
get clicked.

00:31:00.868 --> 00:31:03.300
So you can insert
an entire form in a Wave,

00:31:03.300 --> 00:31:05.200
but then when, you know,
a button gets clicked,

00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:07.300
you can react
and do something.

00:31:07.300 --> 00:31:09.300
Now, what can you do,
you might wonder.

00:31:09.300 --> 00:31:10.701
A whole bunch of things.

00:31:10.701 --> 00:31:14.100
Essentially, we allow you
to manipulate the robot

00:31:14.100 --> 00:31:16.501
in...[stammering]

00:31:16.501 --> 00:31:20.067
manipulate the document
in whatever way you want

00:31:20.067 --> 00:31:23.534
by creating new replies,
creating new waves

00:31:23.534 --> 00:31:27.100
or changing the text title
or whatever is in there.

00:31:27.100 --> 00:31:28.701
And again,
we have this gadget form

00:31:28.701 --> 00:31:30.501
and TextView
that makes it simple

00:31:30.501 --> 00:31:32.300
to make text modifications

00:31:32.300 --> 00:31:34.701
or just modify
the state of the gadget

00:31:34.701 --> 00:31:38.567
or to modify the form.

00:31:40.901 --> 00:31:46.501
As of today, we have
on the code, the Google site,

00:31:46.501 --> 00:31:50.300
we have two APIs published,

00:31:50.300 --> 00:31:53.300
one in Python
and one in Java.

00:31:53.300 --> 00:31:55.100
And they both run on the--

00:31:55.100 --> 00:31:57.901
and the reason that
we have done it this way

00:31:57.901 --> 00:32:00.100
is that we have
this wire protocol

00:32:00.100 --> 00:32:02.167
that goes out
to the HTTP servers

00:32:02.167 --> 00:32:05.767
and that the adjacent
saying, well, we're...

00:32:05.767 --> 00:32:07.968
we're, unfortunately,
not quite ready

00:32:07.968 --> 00:32:10.400
to commit to that completely.

00:32:10.400 --> 00:32:12.534
'Cause we changed
a lot of things.

00:32:12.534 --> 00:32:14.901
So instead, we have chosen
for now to give you

00:32:14.901 --> 00:32:16.868
the Python Library
and the Java Library,

00:32:16.868 --> 00:32:18.434
and we can kind of promise

00:32:18.434 --> 00:32:20.667
that we keep those APIs
fairly stable,

00:32:20.667 --> 00:32:22.801
and the wire protocol
underneath it might change.

00:32:22.801 --> 00:32:25.501
Once we get to the point where
we actually are fairly sure,

00:32:25.501 --> 00:32:28.033
you know, when we get that,
we'll standardize on that.

00:32:28.033 --> 00:32:30.100
We'll publish the thing
and, you know,

00:32:30.100 --> 00:32:32.267
if you wanna go wild
and create other libraries,

00:32:32.267 --> 00:32:33.734
then it's all fine.

00:32:33.734 --> 00:32:35.534
Or if you find that,
you know,

00:32:35.534 --> 00:32:37.133
our libraries
that will open source

00:32:37.133 --> 00:32:38.701
or are...

00:32:38.701 --> 00:32:42.133
are faulty or need things,
please send us the changes.

00:32:42.133 --> 00:32:44.567
You know,
it can always be better.

00:32:44.567 --> 00:32:47.033
Anyway, so I have here
the code in Python

00:32:47.033 --> 00:32:49.000
of a very simple robot.

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:51.868
You know, I could have
taken the Java version of this,

00:32:51.868 --> 00:32:53.868
but then, you know,
I would have needed

00:32:53.868 --> 00:32:56.501
seven files
instead of, uh, 20 lines.

00:32:56.501 --> 00:32:58.868
[laughter]

00:32:58.868 --> 00:33:01.968
[applause]

00:33:01.968 --> 00:33:06.467
Good thing
it's not JavaOne here.

00:33:06.467 --> 00:33:08.634
Anyway, so this--
this robot is very simple.

00:33:08.634 --> 00:33:11.067
We create here the robot.
We call it Yasr.

00:33:11.067 --> 00:33:13.467
And you might wonder why
Yasr.

00:33:13.467 --> 00:33:15.667
Well, that's because
when people get the chance

00:33:15.667 --> 00:33:17.234
to play with a robot API,

00:33:17.234 --> 00:33:18.901
there's always two things
they want to try:

00:33:18.901 --> 00:33:21.501
One is Echoy, which echoes
whatever the user types.

00:33:21.501 --> 00:33:23.501
And the other one
is they realize

00:33:23.501 --> 00:33:25.567
that a Wave doesn't have
any Smiley support.

00:33:25.567 --> 00:33:28.000
If you type a Smiley,
it doesn't stop to do that.

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:29.801
So they come
to the brilliant idea

00:33:29.801 --> 00:33:31.801
that they should be
the first person to do that.

00:33:31.801 --> 00:33:33.634
They're not.
[laughter]

00:33:33.634 --> 00:33:36.701
So Yasr means
"yet another Smiley robot."

00:33:36.701 --> 00:33:38.968
Okay, so Yasr subscribes

00:33:38.968 --> 00:33:43.033
to the events
blip submitted...event.

00:33:43.033 --> 00:33:46.634
And then it will actually

00:33:46.634 --> 00:33:50.634
call this on blip submitted
function, which is defined here.

00:33:50.634 --> 00:33:53.167
This thing then goes
to the context.

00:33:53.167 --> 00:33:55.734
So we have two elements here.
We have properties and context.

00:33:55.734 --> 00:34:00.167
Properties is...

00:34:00.167 --> 00:34:01.834
it's a little...

00:34:01.834 --> 00:34:04.167
so properties
is specific to that event,

00:34:04.167 --> 00:34:06.701
and contacts is sort of
like what happened--

00:34:06.701 --> 00:34:08.801
what is the context
in which this event happened.

00:34:08.801 --> 00:34:10.834
So what are the bits
of the Wave?

00:34:10.834 --> 00:34:14.000
And we...

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:17.234
don't quite support yet...

00:34:17.234 --> 00:34:20.234
a good way to specify
which contacts you want.

00:34:20.234 --> 00:34:22.200
But the idea is that as,
you know,

00:34:22.200 --> 00:34:25.200
that you don't always want to
have full access to everything.

00:34:25.200 --> 00:34:28.667
That, you know,
you don't want to have always

00:34:28.667 --> 00:34:31.400
the entire Wave sent
to your poor little robot

00:34:31.400 --> 00:34:33.434
if you're only interested
in the title changing.

00:34:33.434 --> 00:34:35.234
Anyway, so if we have
this little thing,

00:34:35.234 --> 00:34:38.033
we look for this string
and we look for that string

00:34:38.033 --> 00:34:41.067
and then we substitute it
by the Unicode character

00:34:41.067 --> 00:34:42.734
that is that thing.

00:34:42.734 --> 00:34:45.100
So now we'll see whether...

00:34:45.100 --> 00:34:47.701
the gods of the network are...

00:34:47.701 --> 00:34:51.434
Here we have the Smiley robot,
and I can reply to this

00:34:51.434 --> 00:34:56.567
and I can say...Hello.

00:34:56.567 --> 00:34:58.300
And now...

00:34:58.300 --> 00:35:00.400
you see, it substituted
for a tiny Smiley.

00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:04.434
You know, that's the drawback
of using the Unicode trick.

00:35:04.434 --> 00:35:06.234
You could also insert an image,

00:35:06.234 --> 00:35:08.968
but then the whole code
would be a little longer.

00:35:08.968 --> 00:35:11.133
So that's the simplest robot
that you can imagine.

00:35:11.133 --> 00:35:12.868
It's not very useful.

00:35:12.868 --> 00:35:15.968
Now, if we take the code
of just before

00:35:15.968 --> 00:35:17.767
and we insert this...

00:35:17.767 --> 00:35:22.534
we get a slightly more...
more interesting thing.

00:35:22.534 --> 00:35:25.567
This was based on an idea of
somebody from the search team.

00:35:25.567 --> 00:35:27.033
Essentially what it does here,

00:35:27.033 --> 00:35:29.067
it looks at the contents
of your blip.

00:35:29.067 --> 00:35:30.767
It looks for three
question marks

00:35:30.767 --> 00:35:33.267
and then it substitutes it
for a star,

00:35:33.267 --> 00:35:36.567
and it does using the Ajax
Search APIs that Google has.

00:35:36.567 --> 00:35:38.400
It does a search for that thing.

00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:40.534
And it looks at all the results,

00:35:40.534 --> 00:35:43.367
and it finds back
all the things that are

00:35:43.367 --> 00:35:45.667
using as a tiny
regular expression here

00:35:45.667 --> 00:35:47.133
that are in bold,

00:35:47.133 --> 00:35:49.767
and then it counts
all the things that are in bold

00:35:49.767 --> 00:35:52.100
and it returns the one
that has the highest frequency.

00:35:52.100 --> 00:35:54.300
So what does it all mean?

00:35:54.300 --> 00:35:56.167
I, you know,
I'll show you what it means

00:35:56.167 --> 00:36:00.801
by bringing up this robot.

00:36:00.801 --> 00:36:04.100
Ah...where is he?

00:36:04.100 --> 00:36:05.901
There we go.

00:36:05.901 --> 00:36:07.834
So I can ask this robot
questions

00:36:07.834 --> 00:36:14.767
by saying things like
the capital of Germany is--

00:36:14.767 --> 00:36:17.300
It's a little scary.
I've never tried this.

00:36:17.300 --> 00:36:19.334
So what it will do,
it will do a quick Google search

00:36:19.334 --> 00:36:20.801
for this string,

00:36:20.801 --> 00:36:22.367
except for it takes
the three question marks,

00:36:22.367 --> 00:36:23.767
replace it by a star

00:36:23.767 --> 00:36:25.467
and then essentially
try to count

00:36:25.467 --> 00:36:27.467
what is the most likely,
you know,

00:36:27.467 --> 00:36:29.234
answer that appears in star

00:36:29.234 --> 00:36:32.667
in the Google search results
highlighted.

00:36:32.667 --> 00:36:36.467
So then...

00:36:36.467 --> 00:36:37.467
yes?

00:36:37.467 --> 00:36:39.033
[man speaking indistinctly]

00:36:39.033 --> 00:36:40.634
Osinga: A log?

00:36:40.634 --> 00:36:44.167
Oh, well, it runs on App Engine,
so...

00:36:46.634 --> 00:36:49.434
so, yes, I mean, you can
just look at...

00:36:49.434 --> 00:36:51.834
what the App Engine thing
gets called.

00:36:51.834 --> 00:36:54.467
I'm more concerned
that this didn't actually work.

00:36:54.467 --> 00:36:58.167
[laughter]

00:37:02.834 --> 00:37:06.467
[laughter]

00:37:06.467 --> 00:37:08.334
Ah, there he goes!

00:37:08.334 --> 00:37:16.300
[applause]

00:37:16.300 --> 00:37:18.501
I mean, it's kind of nice,
because it also does things

00:37:18.501 --> 00:37:20.567
where, you know, you don't
know in the middle

00:37:20.567 --> 00:37:21.934
what it was like.

00:37:21.934 --> 00:37:23.901
You can say thing like
found at Google.

00:37:23.901 --> 00:37:25.300
'Cause you know,
there was this guy,

00:37:25.300 --> 00:37:29.267
but I forgot his name.

00:37:29.267 --> 00:37:31.868
Come on.
Do it.

00:37:35.300 --> 00:37:37.601
[man speaking indistinctly]

00:37:37.601 --> 00:37:39.667
Osinga: Well, I know!

00:37:39.667 --> 00:37:40.968
[laughter]

00:37:40.968 --> 00:37:43.868
Ah...poor network.

00:37:46.701 --> 00:37:49.767
Anyway, um...

00:37:49.767 --> 00:37:52.267
it's really quite nice,
what you can do

00:37:52.267 --> 00:37:56.701
with just
a simple bits of Python codes.

00:37:56.701 --> 00:38:00.801
So...we have a bunch
of other examples here

00:38:00.801 --> 00:38:03.868
that mostly figured
in a demo this morning.

00:38:03.868 --> 00:38:07.601
We have Polly.
It handles the flow of polling.

00:38:07.601 --> 00:38:10.701
And it really stretches
what you can do with the API.

00:38:10.701 --> 00:38:12.901
Again, it will--
this one is written in Java,

00:38:12.901 --> 00:38:16.934
and you should be able
to look at the code

00:38:16.934 --> 00:38:18.934
as of today.

00:38:18.934 --> 00:38:21.968
It stores the...
you know, it uses the forms

00:38:21.968 --> 00:38:23.601
to interact with the user,

00:38:23.601 --> 00:38:26.367
and the other thing that's
kind of interesting is that

00:38:26.367 --> 00:38:28.567
it stores the entire state

00:38:28.567 --> 00:38:30.968
of all the thing that happens
in the Wave.

00:38:30.968 --> 00:38:34.567
We have this little thing
called data documents,

00:38:34.567 --> 00:38:36.567
and data documents
are like blips

00:38:36.567 --> 00:38:38.968
except for that they're
not visible to the user.

00:38:38.968 --> 00:38:41.367
They're really for robots
to store their state in that.

00:38:41.367 --> 00:38:43.968
And a robot could, you know,
either use that

00:38:43.968 --> 00:38:45.567
to share that information
with other robots,

00:38:45.567 --> 00:38:48.567
or it can even go as far as
creating a private reply

00:38:48.567 --> 00:38:51.167
or creating a private wavelet
with the data documents and that

00:38:51.167 --> 00:38:53.267
so that you now have this Wave

00:38:53.267 --> 00:38:55.300
where there's
this little bit of data

00:38:55.300 --> 00:38:57.567
where you can store your own
arbitrary key value pairs

00:38:57.567 --> 00:39:00.567
and that you know that
only your robot has access to.

00:39:00.567 --> 00:39:03.534
I imagine you wanna write
something like a poker game

00:39:03.534 --> 00:39:05.100
that, you know...

00:39:05.100 --> 00:39:07.834
and if you want to just
play it for fun, that's fine.

00:39:07.834 --> 00:39:09.234
But if you want to do it
more seriously,

00:39:09.234 --> 00:39:10.634
it becomes kind of important.

00:39:10.634 --> 00:39:12.234
You can't actually just,
you know,

00:39:12.234 --> 00:39:14.834
look at what goes over the wire
and see that, you know,

00:39:14.834 --> 00:39:17.033
the gadget that handles
the while poker game

00:39:17.033 --> 00:39:20.434
actually knows what the cards
of your opponents are.

00:39:20.434 --> 00:39:23.234
So using this day thing,
you can actually

00:39:23.234 --> 00:39:25.434
get around that.

00:39:25.434 --> 00:39:29.367
Bloggy publishes waves
to a blog.

00:39:29.367 --> 00:39:34.534
So the way that that works
is that...

00:39:34.534 --> 00:39:37.234
there are two things
that you need to do to publish.

00:39:37.234 --> 00:39:40.234
One is you want to make this
Wave accessible to everybody,

00:39:40.234 --> 00:39:41.834
not just the people
that are on the Wave.

00:39:41.834 --> 00:39:44.434
'Cause by default,
waves are only accessible

00:39:44.434 --> 00:39:47.634
by people that were added
to this Wave.

00:39:47.634 --> 00:39:51.033
So we have come up with
this secret group--

00:39:51.033 --> 00:39:53.634
It's called pubic@gwave.com--

00:39:53.634 --> 00:39:57.434
which actually has
all Wave users in it.

00:39:57.434 --> 00:39:59.834
So if you add that thing
to a Wave,

00:39:59.834 --> 00:40:02.434
this Wave now becomes
available to everybody.

00:40:02.434 --> 00:40:04.834
And, uh...

00:40:04.834 --> 00:40:06.634
the nice thing about that
is that, you know,

00:40:06.634 --> 00:40:08.868
then you can actually
use it for blogging.

00:40:08.868 --> 00:40:10.634
Right now, if you do that,

00:40:10.634 --> 00:40:12.634
it won't actually work
completely

00:40:12.634 --> 00:40:14.834
because we're still, you know,
only in sandbox,

00:40:14.834 --> 00:40:17.634
so anybody that doesn't
have a sandbox account

00:40:17.634 --> 00:40:20.267
that goes to your blog
demonstration

00:40:20.267 --> 00:40:22.634
will actually see some sort
of screen saying like,

00:40:22.634 --> 00:40:24.033
look, this is a demo.

00:40:24.033 --> 00:40:27.033
But after we go public,
we'll make it possible

00:40:27.033 --> 00:40:30.067
that people that don't have
a Wave account

00:40:30.067 --> 00:40:32.033
when they go
to your published Wave

00:40:32.033 --> 00:40:34.033
get automatically signed in

00:40:34.033 --> 00:40:37.234
by a virtual user
called anonymous

00:40:37.234 --> 00:40:39.834
and then can interact
in a limited way

00:40:39.834 --> 00:40:43.634
with your Wave
without having a Wave account.

00:40:43.634 --> 00:40:45.300
Uh, Buggy.

00:40:45.300 --> 00:40:48.167
Yeah, so Buggy is a...
the drawback

00:40:48.167 --> 00:40:50.501
is that we're secretly
using an API

00:40:50.501 --> 00:40:52.834
that, you know,
isn't quite ready out there.

00:40:52.834 --> 00:40:55.200
So we can't really come out
with the code there.

00:40:55.200 --> 00:40:58.667
But we think it demonstrates
a very nice

00:40:58.667 --> 00:40:59.968
how you can use robots

00:40:59.968 --> 00:41:03.234
to connect Wave
to legacy systems.

00:41:05.100 --> 00:41:06.567
Yeah, Searchy.

00:41:06.567 --> 00:41:11.033
Searchy is the little thing
that...

00:41:11.033 --> 00:41:17.167
if you click in the Wave client
here on top...

00:41:17.167 --> 00:41:20.067
well, that's interesting.

00:41:20.067 --> 00:41:22.067
Oh, here.

00:41:22.067 --> 00:41:24.334
It actually populates
this thing here.

00:41:24.334 --> 00:41:26.834
And it shows off
that it's a nice combination

00:41:26.834 --> 00:41:29.934
between UI elements
and a robot.

00:41:29.934 --> 00:41:31.968
So, you know, we could have
gone the simple way here

00:41:31.968 --> 00:41:36.467
and done this all on the...
on the client's site

00:41:36.467 --> 00:41:39.367
using the search APIs
that we have at Google here.

00:41:39.367 --> 00:41:41.567
But we decided
not to go that way

00:41:41.567 --> 00:41:44.434
because using a robot,
we can make it so that

00:41:44.434 --> 00:41:46.434
we can search together

00:41:46.434 --> 00:41:49.567
And, you know, we haven't quite
worked that out to the bottom,

00:41:49.567 --> 00:41:51.133
'cause, you know,
there's a lot to do.

00:41:51.133 --> 00:41:54.100
But we think it's very powerful
and it's possible for,

00:41:54.100 --> 00:41:56.634
you know, if you can't
find somebody else--

00:41:56.634 --> 00:41:58.934
if you can't find something
on Google

00:41:58.934 --> 00:42:00.567
or your favorite search engine

00:42:00.567 --> 00:42:03.133
that you can just add
somebody to your search session

00:42:03.133 --> 00:42:05.467
and that way,
search together.

00:42:08.934 --> 00:42:13.534
Tweety, one of our, I think,
most attractive robots.

00:42:13.534 --> 00:42:16.534
At this point,
it shows two things off.

00:42:16.534 --> 00:42:18.634
It shows how you can sync
between

00:42:18.634 --> 00:42:22.968
an external communication
system like Twitter and Wave,

00:42:22.968 --> 00:42:24.567
but it also shows you--

00:42:24.567 --> 00:42:27.434
and this is in the details
of the API--

00:42:27.434 --> 00:42:30.367
but you can...

00:42:30.367 --> 00:42:32.567
so by default,
everything that the robot does

00:42:32.567 --> 00:42:34.434
is assigned to that robot.

00:42:34.434 --> 00:42:36.968
And in the case of Twitter,
you don't actually want that,

00:42:36.968 --> 00:42:39.968
because you don't want
the post from Twitter coming in

00:42:39.968 --> 00:42:42.534
being labeled as from
Twitter the robot.

00:42:42.534 --> 00:42:44.033
You want to have this post
coming in

00:42:44.033 --> 00:42:47.767
being labeled from...

00:42:47.767 --> 00:42:50.767
the person
that Twittered this.

00:42:50.767 --> 00:42:52.767
So we have this thing
where robots

00:42:52.767 --> 00:42:56.767
can create blips on account
of external people.

00:42:56.767 --> 00:42:59.567
And that opens up
an entire new way,

00:42:59.567 --> 00:43:01.834
an entire new gateway
to building robots,

00:43:01.834 --> 00:43:04.033
because that way you can
build gateway robots.

00:43:04.033 --> 00:43:06.667
You could do this for email,
for example,

00:43:06.667 --> 00:43:09.834
where you take incoming emails

00:43:09.834 --> 00:43:18.000
and you make them appear
on account of somebody else.

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:20.067
Okay...

00:43:20.067 --> 00:43:23.434
I wanted to leave a lot of
time for questions.

00:43:23.434 --> 00:43:25.334
I see we have
16 minutes left, so...

00:43:25.334 --> 00:43:27.234
I'll just see what
we can do.

00:43:27.234 --> 00:43:29.067
Well, it should be okay.

00:43:29.067 --> 00:43:30.701
Yes.

00:43:30.701 --> 00:43:35.200
So the last bit of the API
is the extension API.

00:43:35.200 --> 00:43:39.367
And, uh, the extension API
is our answer

00:43:39.367 --> 00:43:43.467
to how do you distribute
these robots and these gadgets?

00:43:43.467 --> 00:43:45.868
Because, you know, we could
stick them into a gallery.

00:43:45.868 --> 00:43:47.534
That is sort of like
the standard practice

00:43:47.534 --> 00:43:49.167
in the industry.

00:43:49.167 --> 00:43:50.601
And then your users,

00:43:50.601 --> 00:43:52.701
every time they want
to invoke this robot

00:43:52.701 --> 00:43:54.501
or every time they want
to insert this gadget,

00:43:54.501 --> 00:43:55.501
they will have to go
to this gallery

00:43:55.501 --> 00:43:57.968
and find that thing back.

00:43:57.968 --> 00:43:59.567
And, you know,
it's a lot of hassle.

00:43:59.567 --> 00:44:01.901
Especially since, you know,
that works kind of okay

00:44:01.901 --> 00:44:03.334
for something like iGoogle,

00:44:03.334 --> 00:44:05.167
because there you installed
the gadget once,

00:44:05.167 --> 00:44:06.400
and you're done.

00:44:06.400 --> 00:44:07.868
But here,
if you like this chess gadget,

00:44:07.868 --> 00:44:09.567
more likely than not,

00:44:09.567 --> 00:44:12.501
you'll want to keep inserting
this chess gadget

00:44:12.501 --> 00:44:14.667
and play chess with many,
many of your...

00:44:14.667 --> 00:44:16.400
of your friends.

00:44:16.400 --> 00:44:19.167
So then if--
every time you have to go there,

00:44:19.167 --> 00:44:20.534
it's a lot of hassle.

00:44:20.534 --> 00:44:22.734
So instead we came up with idea
of these extensions,

00:44:22.734 --> 00:44:25.634
and extensions is essentially
a little...

00:44:25.634 --> 00:44:28.868
it's a little XML document
that hooks...

00:44:28.868 --> 00:44:32.501
that...connects
a hook to an action.

00:44:32.501 --> 00:44:34.767
So we have a bunch of hooks
in the client,

00:44:34.767 --> 00:44:36.734
and right now I think

00:44:36.734 --> 00:44:41.968
we only have two
in the new Wave menu,

00:44:41.968 --> 00:44:44.234
and in the toolbar
you can add things.

00:44:44.234 --> 00:44:47.667
But we're actively
working to expand this

00:44:47.667 --> 00:44:50.901
to make it possible
to hook into keyboard shortcuts

00:44:50.901 --> 00:44:53.234
and the file menu,
and we have plans

00:44:53.234 --> 00:44:56.033
to support text macros,
and that sort of thing.

00:44:56.033 --> 00:44:58.234
And all these things
will then invoke

00:44:58.234 --> 00:45:01.934
one of the...
the things that we have.

00:45:01.934 --> 00:45:03.467
What can they do?

00:45:03.467 --> 00:45:05.767
Essentially,
they can trigger an action,

00:45:05.767 --> 00:45:07.801
and the actions
that they can do right now

00:45:07.801 --> 00:45:10.901
is they can insert a gadget
in the current Wave,

00:45:10.901 --> 00:45:14.000
they can add a participant,
or they can create a new Wave.

00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:15.901
And again, there, you know,

00:45:15.901 --> 00:45:17.968
there's an infinite amount
of new actions

00:45:17.968 --> 00:45:20.801
you'd come up with,
and we expect to add them.

00:45:20.801 --> 00:45:24.167
So how does it look
in practice?

00:45:24.167 --> 00:45:27.467
So this is the...
the document

00:45:27.467 --> 00:45:29.133
that I was talking about.

00:45:29.133 --> 00:45:31.367
In this case we say, well,
we have this extension

00:45:31.367 --> 00:45:33.601
insert something
into the toolbar.

00:45:33.601 --> 00:45:37.200
And there's a little info
thing here

00:45:37.200 --> 00:45:40.701
with a tool tip
and an icon.

00:45:40.701 --> 00:45:44.367
And this is an icon that,
unfortunately for you guys,

00:45:44.367 --> 00:45:47.234
I drew, so...
it's not as pretty,

00:45:47.234 --> 00:45:49.267
half as pretty
as the rest of the client.

00:45:49.267 --> 00:45:52.467
This is one of the things
that always breaks Lars' heart

00:45:52.467 --> 00:45:56.367
when it comes to developers
that...

00:45:56.367 --> 00:45:58.567
they have the ability
to make things ugly.

00:45:58.567 --> 00:46:00.667
[laughter]

00:46:00.667 --> 00:46:03.601
So please,
if you publish something,

00:46:03.601 --> 00:46:07.601
make sure it looks pretty
so Lars is also happy.

00:46:07.601 --> 00:46:09.501
And then we have
this other thing

00:46:09.501 --> 00:46:11.634
where we insert
this participant map

00:46:11.634 --> 00:46:14.334
that, you know,
we had before.

00:46:14.334 --> 00:46:15.868
Oh!

00:46:15.868 --> 00:46:19.901
So then if we...
right now...

00:46:19.901 --> 00:46:21.767
the way that you create
these things

00:46:21.767 --> 00:46:25.934
are a little unfortunate
because we haven't...

00:46:25.934 --> 00:46:28.634
We'll come up with
a better UI for that.

00:46:28.634 --> 00:46:30.834
But this
is for developers only,

00:46:30.834 --> 00:46:33.567
so we figured that
it's probably okay.

00:46:36.234 --> 00:46:38.634
So the way it works

00:46:38.634 --> 00:46:40.434
is you go to
the debug menu here,

00:46:40.434 --> 00:46:44.033
which also...and you choose
this add extension installer

00:46:44.033 --> 00:46:47.834
where you insert
the manifest URL and...

00:46:47.834 --> 00:46:50.033
image URL that shows
the content of the thing.

00:46:50.033 --> 00:46:51.834
And you get something
like this.

00:46:51.834 --> 00:46:53.634
And you can see here that...

00:46:53.634 --> 00:46:56.033
that, you know, you have
this little puzzle piece

00:46:56.033 --> 00:46:58.634
that describes the extension
that I created.

00:46:58.634 --> 00:47:00.701
And now if I create
this install button--

00:47:00.701 --> 00:47:02.701
let me show you...look.

00:47:02.701 --> 00:47:06.100
There is no ugly
toolbar button here.

00:47:06.100 --> 00:47:10.300
But now when I click install,

00:47:10.300 --> 00:47:12.234
nothing happens.

00:47:15.901 --> 00:47:19.133
Let's see...

00:47:25.901 --> 00:47:27.701
Wireless network unavailable.

00:47:27.701 --> 00:47:31.634
Well, I thought
I didn't have...

00:47:34.701 --> 00:47:38.701
Yes, so now it switched
from install to uninstall

00:47:38.701 --> 00:47:40.100
because I haven't installed
this thing.

00:47:40.100 --> 00:47:42.400
And now if I go to the--
ooh.

00:47:42.400 --> 00:47:44.100
[laughter]

00:47:44.100 --> 00:47:47.701
To the edit button, you see
here, indeed, an ugly button.

00:47:47.701 --> 00:47:49.501
How nicely created.

00:47:49.501 --> 00:47:52.100
And I can go ahead
and create a new Wave,

00:47:52.100 --> 00:47:54.300
and now I can insert
this gadget,

00:47:54.300 --> 00:47:56.100
and you see that, you know,

00:47:56.100 --> 00:47:59.300
it inserted that
"where are you" gadget

00:47:59.300 --> 00:48:01.567
with my draggable icon here.

00:48:01.567 --> 00:48:03.367
So that's a really neat way

00:48:03.367 --> 00:48:06.767
to distribute applications
that you built on top of Wave.

00:48:06.767 --> 00:48:11.367
So, I mean, you can create
a Wave with that installer on it

00:48:11.367 --> 00:48:12.567
and then invite
all your friends,

00:48:12.567 --> 00:48:14.367
an they can invite
their friends.

00:48:14.367 --> 00:48:15.767
Or you can create this Wave,

00:48:15.767 --> 00:48:17.167
describe the application
that you built,

00:48:17.167 --> 00:48:18.567
and embed that thing
on the website.

00:48:18.567 --> 00:48:20.667
So you can have your website
with your product.

00:48:20.667 --> 00:48:22.234
And people clicking
that button--

00:48:22.234 --> 00:48:24.767
well, when they visit your
website, they see immediately

00:48:24.767 --> 00:48:28.167
whether they have that extension
installed or not.

00:48:28.167 --> 00:48:29.767
And people clicking that button

00:48:29.767 --> 00:48:31.901
will get that extension
installed in their client.

00:48:31.901 --> 00:48:36.767
So it's a really neat way
to combine the...

00:48:36.767 --> 00:48:40.767
the install niceties
of traditional software

00:48:40.767 --> 00:48:43.968
with the greatness

00:48:43.968 --> 00:48:46.501
of these sort of
web-based applications.

00:48:50.968 --> 00:48:52.968
Okay, thanks.

00:48:52.968 --> 00:48:54.567
That was all I have.

00:48:54.567 --> 00:48:57.167
So we have like ten minutes
for questions.

00:48:57.167 --> 00:49:01.033
And again, haveasec.com/io

00:49:01.033 --> 00:49:03.234
will take your feedback
for this thing.

00:49:03.234 --> 00:49:04.834
Thank you very much.

00:49:04.834 --> 00:49:11.767
[applause]

00:49:11.767 --> 00:49:13.267
If you do have a question,

00:49:13.267 --> 00:49:15.634
please use the microphone
so...

00:49:15.634 --> 00:49:17.634
this talk is being recorded,

00:49:17.634 --> 00:49:19.033
and it'd be nice
for the people

00:49:19.033 --> 00:49:21.567
that want
to listen to it later.

00:49:23.434 --> 00:49:24.434
Uh, yes.

00:49:24.434 --> 00:49:26.234
man: On the android platform,

00:49:26.234 --> 00:49:32.434
we can run a Wave client
within a browser frame.

00:49:32.434 --> 00:49:35.033
Is it possible--
will it be possible

00:49:35.033 --> 00:49:37.634
to have in the Android API

00:49:37.634 --> 00:49:43.033
the ability to access wavelets
and these blips directly?

00:49:43.033 --> 00:49:47.667
Without having to create
a separate frame.

00:49:47.667 --> 00:49:51.634
Osinga: Um, so...
you want to...

00:49:51.634 --> 00:49:56.033
man: Could we create
our own Wave client

00:49:56.033 --> 00:49:59.834
using, in essence,
the Android API

00:49:59.834 --> 00:50:03.234
instead of having to go
through a browser within--

00:50:03.234 --> 00:50:07.033
a browser frame within
the Android API?

00:50:07.033 --> 00:50:09.033
Osinga: Uh...
well, I suppose you could,

00:50:09.033 --> 00:50:11.968
but it seems that--

00:50:11.968 --> 00:50:13.634
So that sort of--

00:50:13.634 --> 00:50:15.834
so the API
that I described here

00:50:15.834 --> 00:50:19.434
is really about
how you expand the...

00:50:19.434 --> 00:50:22.634
the Wave client as we build it
and using your robots.

00:50:22.634 --> 00:50:23.834
If you want to do something
like that

00:50:23.834 --> 00:50:26.033
and build a native client
for Wave,

00:50:26.033 --> 00:50:27.434
that will be possible,

00:50:27.434 --> 00:50:29.834
but it's not covered
with our current APIs.

00:50:29.834 --> 00:50:32.801
'Cause for that,
we would have to...

00:50:32.801 --> 00:50:34.634
you know,
and we're working on that.

00:50:34.634 --> 00:50:36.234
The protocol that is spoken

00:50:36.234 --> 00:50:38.167
between the server
and the client

00:50:38.167 --> 00:50:41.234
would have to be stable enough
for us to publish it

00:50:41.234 --> 00:50:43.234
so that you can come up
with your own native client.

00:50:43.234 --> 00:50:44.567
man: Yes.

00:50:44.567 --> 00:50:47.234
Osinga: You can do it
kind of using federation.

00:50:47.234 --> 00:50:49.634
I mean, if you went
to the talk this morning,

00:50:49.634 --> 00:50:54.367
there was this Python client
with text-based form stuff.

00:50:54.367 --> 00:50:55.634
man: Yes.

00:50:55.634 --> 00:50:57.367
Osinga: So that's kind of
in that direction.

00:50:57.367 --> 00:50:59.400
man: Okay. Thank you.
Osinga: Thanks.

00:50:59.400 --> 00:51:01.701
Take from the other side.
Sorry.

00:51:01.701 --> 00:51:03.534
man: Yeah, hi.
Thanks for the great talk.

00:51:03.534 --> 00:51:05.567
So far I've only seen you guys
logging in

00:51:05.567 --> 00:51:08.701
with consumer Google Accounts,
Gmail Accounts.

00:51:08.701 --> 00:51:11.701
Are there any plans to make
this work with Google Apps,

00:51:11.701 --> 00:51:13.300
specifically premier edition,

00:51:13.300 --> 00:51:16.300
and enable things like
signed fetch

00:51:16.300 --> 00:51:17.901
for secure data connector

00:51:17.901 --> 00:51:19.501
and private gadgets
and these kinds of things?

00:51:19.501 --> 00:51:22.501
Osinga: Well,
there's lots of plans.

00:51:22.501 --> 00:51:24.901
To start with
your first question,

00:51:24.901 --> 00:51:29.033
so actually, the...

00:51:29.033 --> 00:51:30.901
this thing is not a...

00:51:30.901 --> 00:51:34.100
this thing here runs
on a hosted domain, right?

00:51:34.100 --> 00:51:37.100
So it's not your normal
Gmail Account.

00:51:37.100 --> 00:51:40.100
It's a separate thing,
so we have...

00:51:40.100 --> 00:51:41.901
that is how we'll start,

00:51:41.901 --> 00:51:43.701
with just domains
for your thing, and...

00:51:43.701 --> 00:51:48.100
yeah, so the embedding story,
if you wanna continue that,

00:51:48.100 --> 00:51:51.667
will at some point support...

00:51:51.667 --> 00:51:53.300
the ability for, you know,

00:51:53.300 --> 00:51:55.501
for non-Google people
to log into there.

00:51:55.501 --> 00:51:57.100
But we're not quite done there.

00:51:57.100 --> 00:51:58.501
But, yeah, we're working
on that.

00:51:58.501 --> 00:52:01.367
And, yeah, this whole...
gadgets--

00:52:01.367 --> 00:52:03.567
we're also working on that,
yeah.

00:52:03.567 --> 00:52:05.167
man: Great. That's good news.
Thank you.

00:52:05.167 --> 00:52:07.167
Osinga: So...yes and yes.
Yeah.

00:52:07.167 --> 00:52:10.167
man: I had a couple questions.
Osinga: A couple?

00:52:10.167 --> 00:52:11.968
man: One, is there any
SEO combinations,

00:52:11.968 --> 00:52:14.167
like if we wanted to use this
as sort of like

00:52:14.167 --> 00:52:18.100
a...open discussion
for maybe a particular user

00:52:18.100 --> 00:52:20.868
or instance of something
on a site,

00:52:20.868 --> 00:52:23.367
to have that be, you know,
SEOed at all?

00:52:23.367 --> 00:52:25.767
I know it's active,
it's constantly changing,

00:52:25.767 --> 00:52:27.968
but...is that possible?

00:52:27.968 --> 00:52:29.734
'Cause I know it's a frame,
and I don't know,

00:52:29.734 --> 00:52:32.167
it's not gonna be a next
in relation to the site at all.

00:52:32.167 --> 00:52:35.100
Osinga: Yeah.
Yeah, so...again.

00:52:35.100 --> 00:52:36.767
I mean, this is all
a developer preview,

00:52:36.767 --> 00:52:38.767
so a lot of these questions,
we have answers,

00:52:38.767 --> 00:52:40.634
but we're not quite ready
with them.

00:52:40.634 --> 00:52:42.567
So we have a...

00:52:42.567 --> 00:52:44.734
The way it will work is that
any of those waves

00:52:44.734 --> 00:52:46.534
also has a static version.

00:52:46.534 --> 00:52:48.367
And we'll make it so that

00:52:48.367 --> 00:52:50.968
if you do the right thing
with the embed,

00:52:50.968 --> 00:52:53.567
that we'll have some sort
of information

00:52:53.567 --> 00:52:54.968
to point out to the crawler

00:52:54.968 --> 00:52:57.167
where to find the static
version of that thing.

00:52:57.167 --> 00:52:58.968
Now, of course, the crawler
won't, you know--

00:52:58.968 --> 00:53:01.601
it will get the static version
and not the dynamic version.

00:53:01.601 --> 00:53:04.634
But we think we can
make it so that

00:53:04.634 --> 00:53:06.501
that will all work out

00:53:06.501 --> 00:53:10.234
and that the crawler will index
the content on your website

00:53:10.234 --> 00:53:14.033
as belonging to you at the point
of where it came by.

00:53:14.033 --> 00:53:15.834
man: Okay, and then
one quick one.

00:53:15.834 --> 00:53:19.133
Script libs, like dojo
or new tools or something--

00:53:19.133 --> 00:53:20.834
can I use those in extensions

00:53:20.834 --> 00:53:23.067
without, you know,
before I use new tools

00:53:23.067 --> 00:53:25.167
and erect a dom
with the dollar sign?

00:53:25.167 --> 00:53:26.400
Is that possible?

00:53:26.400 --> 00:53:27.801
Osinga: Where?

00:53:27.801 --> 00:53:31.267
man: Like using a script lib
library inside of the extensions

00:53:31.267 --> 00:53:33.634
to do...you know,

00:53:33.634 --> 00:53:36.601
if I wanted to augment
certain things with...

00:53:36.601 --> 00:53:41.634
Osinga: So...you can totally
use something, you know...

00:53:41.634 --> 00:53:43.234
I'm still not sure
I follow--

00:53:43.234 --> 00:53:45.033
man: Okay, so like new tools,
if I use that,

00:53:45.033 --> 00:53:47.033
if I instantiate it, obviously,
if there's any other--

00:53:47.033 --> 00:53:48.834
It's done with web toolkits,

00:53:48.834 --> 00:53:50.434
so I'm sure it spits out
native script.

00:53:50.434 --> 00:53:52.434
But it's obviously gonna
collide and destroy

00:53:52.434 --> 00:53:55.234
any other library out there
that's trying to...

00:53:55.234 --> 00:53:57.434
Osinga: So...
so the gadgets...

00:53:57.434 --> 00:54:00.067
the gadgets run
normal JavaScript.

00:54:00.067 --> 00:54:03.901
We have a grid library
that lets you build

00:54:03.901 --> 00:54:08.901
Wave specific gadgets
for using grid.

00:54:08.901 --> 00:54:11.634
We don't have any dojo
or...that--

00:54:11.634 --> 00:54:13.300
man: Oh, I was just asking
if I could use them.

00:54:13.300 --> 00:54:14.901
Is that okay,
since it's all native script,

00:54:14.901 --> 00:54:16.234
it's gonna be
inside that frame?

00:54:16.234 --> 00:54:18.400
It's not gonna like
hurt it or anything or...

00:54:18.400 --> 00:54:19.701
you guys are cool with that?

00:54:19.701 --> 00:54:20.701
Osinga: No, no, no, no.

00:54:20.701 --> 00:54:23.501
And, you know,
I like JQuery,

00:54:23.501 --> 00:54:28.033
so, you know, for some
of these things I use JQuery.

00:54:31.901 --> 00:54:33.701
Um...yeah.

00:54:33.701 --> 00:54:36.901
man: What browser
would Wave run on?

00:54:36.901 --> 00:54:39.701
Osinga: So currently,
it runs in

00:54:39.701 --> 00:54:42.200
what we like to call
modern browsers.

00:54:42.200 --> 00:54:45.234
So that's like...
[laughter]

00:54:47.133 --> 00:54:49.300
But once we're launched,

00:54:49.300 --> 00:54:54.834
we'll support Internet Explorer,
Safari, Chrome, and Firefox.

00:54:56.767 --> 00:54:57.901
[indistinct]

00:54:57.901 --> 00:54:59.300
man: Can you talk
a little bit about

00:54:59.300 --> 00:55:01.300
the maybe interoperative
ability

00:55:01.300 --> 00:55:05.067
between setting up non-Google
Accounts related to Wave,

00:55:05.067 --> 00:55:07.000
so if we set up
our own server

00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:09.400
that has the federation
protocol implemented

00:55:09.400 --> 00:55:12.234
and then we need to be able
to communicate with waves,

00:55:12.234 --> 00:55:15.234
I assume you won't have to
log into a Google Account

00:55:15.234 --> 00:55:17.968
in order to communicate
with waves.

00:55:17.968 --> 00:55:19.834
And will those be able
to be integrated?

00:55:19.834 --> 00:55:21.167
Does that make sense?

00:55:21.167 --> 00:55:23.434
Osinga: Yeah.
So...right now, you do have to.

00:55:23.434 --> 00:55:26.367
So right now the only way
to use Wave

00:55:26.367 --> 00:55:28.167
is if you have
a Wave Sandbox Account.

00:55:28.167 --> 00:55:31.367
man: Right.
Osinga: But...

00:55:31.367 --> 00:55:33.501
we expect that we can get--

00:55:33.501 --> 00:55:35.334
So the first step
for this will be

00:55:35.334 --> 00:55:39.868
that we'll have
this anonymous API that lets...

00:55:39.868 --> 00:55:42.567
lets you embed a Wave
on a website

00:55:42.567 --> 00:55:46.567
and then assign a user
to the user that comes in there

00:55:46.567 --> 00:55:47.968
using your own
sort of thing.

00:55:47.968 --> 00:55:49.767
And this will be
very untrusted,

00:55:49.767 --> 00:55:51.167
but it allows them
at least to...

00:55:51.167 --> 00:55:53.167
have Wave-like discussions
on that website.

00:55:53.167 --> 00:55:56.167
But we expect that
we'll come out with an API

00:55:56.167 --> 00:55:58.567
that will actually
allow you to do that

00:55:58.567 --> 00:56:04.234
with any...any system...

00:56:04.234 --> 00:56:07.067
you know, like...

00:56:07.067 --> 00:56:11.400
any open ID like thing.

00:56:11.400 --> 00:56:13.634
Does that make sense?

00:56:13.634 --> 00:56:16.167
[man speaking indistinctly]

00:56:16.167 --> 00:56:17.634
Osinga: Well, so, yeah.

00:56:17.634 --> 00:56:20.033
If you go to Federation Wave,
of course, anything is possible.

00:56:20.033 --> 00:56:22.367
Right? Then...

00:56:25.834 --> 00:56:28.334
Yeah. Let's take one
from this side again.

00:56:28.334 --> 00:56:31.234
man: With regard
to the embedding thing,

00:56:31.234 --> 00:56:33.734
it uses just an ID

00:56:33.734 --> 00:56:35.834
that identifies
a particular Wave, right?

00:56:35.834 --> 00:56:36.968
Osinga: Yes.

00:56:36.968 --> 00:56:38.801
man: So if you put in
a different ID,

00:56:38.801 --> 00:56:40.234
you'd get a different Wave,
obviously.

00:56:40.234 --> 00:56:41.501
Osinga: Yes.

00:56:41.501 --> 00:56:43.534
man: Is there any sort of
security concerns

00:56:43.534 --> 00:56:46.033
where, you know,
if you went in and changed--

00:56:46.033 --> 00:56:48.367
someone went into the source
and changed, you know...

00:56:48.367 --> 00:56:50.434
Osinga: Well, there's always
security concerns.

00:56:50.434 --> 00:56:53.434
So the way it works
is that...

00:56:53.434 --> 00:56:55.434
if you put an ID in there

00:56:55.434 --> 00:56:57.234
that the user
that visits your page

00:56:57.234 --> 00:56:59.434
has to have access rights
to that Wave,

00:56:59.434 --> 00:57:02.501
otherwise they will see
a warning that they don't.

00:57:02.501 --> 00:57:03.501
man: Okay.

00:57:03.501 --> 00:57:04.901
Osinga: And you can add

00:57:04.901 --> 00:57:07.501
this special user public
to the Wave

00:57:07.501 --> 00:57:09.901
to make sure that everybody
has access to that Wave.

00:57:09.901 --> 00:57:11.501
But of course,
that will result

00:57:11.501 --> 00:57:14.100
to the thing that everybody
has access to this Wave.

00:57:14.100 --> 00:57:16.868
That's why in a normal
Wave client if you do that,

00:57:16.868 --> 00:57:18.701
you see a little banner
on top warning you

00:57:18.701 --> 00:57:21.300
that this Wave is actually
accessible for everybody.

00:57:21.300 --> 00:57:23.501
And we have this publish API

00:57:23.501 --> 00:57:28.300
that lets the robot
that adds public to the Wave

00:57:28.300 --> 00:57:31.000
also set the little
data document in that Wave

00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:32.567
specifying
where it's published,

00:57:32.567 --> 00:57:36.300
which will change this banner
from a generic warning

00:57:36.300 --> 00:57:38.901
saying "this Wave
is publicly accessible"

00:57:38.901 --> 00:57:40.300
to "this Wave
has been published

00:57:40.300 --> 00:57:42.501
by the publishing author
at the URL."

00:57:42.501 --> 00:57:48.300
That's what you saw
at the demo this morning.

00:57:48.300 --> 00:57:50.100
woman: So the content
of the Wave

00:57:50.100 --> 00:57:52.100
seems to be text right now.

00:57:52.100 --> 00:57:55.300
I was wondering how flexible
the content model is.

00:57:55.300 --> 00:57:57.734
Could you have more structured
types of data

00:57:57.734 --> 00:58:00.968
that you can collaboratively
edit?

00:58:00.968 --> 00:58:02.767
Osinga: Well, so the...

00:58:02.767 --> 00:58:06.167
the waves are...
are not text only.

00:58:06.167 --> 00:58:10.067
I mean, so a Wave
is a tree of blips, right?

00:58:10.067 --> 00:58:13.167
And these blips each
are XML documents

00:58:13.167 --> 00:58:15.367
with arbitrary structure
in them.

00:58:15.367 --> 00:58:19.567
The thing that we have
decided right now

00:58:19.567 --> 00:58:22.567
is that robots--and there's
good reasons for this--

00:58:22.567 --> 00:58:26.567
for right now, robots see
these blips as strings of text.

00:58:26.567 --> 00:58:28.601
It just makes the robots
a lot easier to develop.

00:58:28.601 --> 00:58:30.167
But we expect that over time

00:58:30.167 --> 00:58:33.133
we'll add different views
of this text for the robots

00:58:33.133 --> 00:58:35.567
that will allow you to do
more of these arbitrary things.

00:58:35.567 --> 00:58:36.968
And the same for gadgets.

00:58:36.968 --> 00:58:40.167
So right now, the gadget
state is a key list--

00:58:40.167 --> 00:58:42.234
a list of key value pairs.

00:58:42.234 --> 00:58:44.767
But over time,
we expect to make this into

00:58:44.767 --> 00:58:46.300
more data structures

00:58:46.300 --> 00:58:50.767
that get you whatever
structure that you want.

00:58:50.767 --> 00:58:56.701
man: Any plans for old-school
mail protocol integrability,

00:58:56.701 --> 00:58:58.968
SMTP, IMAP?

00:58:58.968 --> 00:59:01.434
Osinga: Oh. Yes.

00:59:01.434 --> 00:59:03.234
man: Can you elaborate?

00:59:03.234 --> 00:59:04.834
Osinga: But partly,
we hope that

00:59:04.834 --> 00:59:06.834
we'll get our API
to the point

00:59:06.834 --> 00:59:09.834
where it's not us that build
a mail gateway

00:59:09.834 --> 00:59:12.767
but where anybody can come up
with their own gateway.

00:59:12.767 --> 00:59:16.234
So if you look at--I think
the Twitter demo that we have

00:59:16.234 --> 00:59:17.834
gives a glimpse of that.

00:59:17.834 --> 00:59:19.834
Of course, Titter is,
you know, very simple.

00:59:19.834 --> 00:59:21.634
man: So no plans for you guys
to provide those

00:59:21.634 --> 00:59:23.400
out of the gate.

00:59:23.400 --> 00:59:25.267
You want us to kind
of come in--

00:59:25.267 --> 00:59:27.234
Osinga: Well, that would
be ideal, you know, just...

00:59:27.234 --> 00:59:29.434
[laughter]

00:59:29.434 --> 00:59:31.033
That would save so much work.

00:59:31.033 --> 00:59:32.634
So that's part of why
we have this API,

00:59:32.634 --> 00:59:35.434
'cause, you know, it...
there's...

00:59:35.434 --> 00:59:37.234
and, you know, I think
that sort of thing,

00:59:37.234 --> 00:59:38.634
when you get here--

00:59:38.634 --> 00:59:39.901
there's loads and loads
of ideas

00:59:39.901 --> 00:59:41.501
and things that are possible
with Wave,

00:59:41.501 --> 00:59:43.634
and we can't all do them.

00:59:43.634 --> 00:59:45.434
man: You want to displace
email, though,

00:59:45.434 --> 00:59:47.501
like the keynote
was pointing at.

00:59:47.501 --> 00:59:50.434
You're probably gonna want
to interoperate with it

00:59:50.434 --> 00:59:51.634
from the get-go a little bit.

00:59:51.634 --> 00:59:54.033
Osinga: Yes. No, no, no.
And I think...

00:59:54.033 --> 00:59:55.634
I think that, of course,

00:59:55.634 --> 00:59:59.033
that is one of the things
that we'll have at some point.

00:59:59.033 --> 01:00:01.033
That's a really short answer.
I just wanted to...

01:00:01.033 --> 01:00:04.033
Okay, I see there's
ten seconds on the clock.

01:00:04.033 --> 01:00:06.234
man: What would Wave address
look like?

01:00:06.234 --> 01:00:08.000
Osinga: So a Wave address
right now

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.467
looks like the domain
that hosts that address,

01:00:10.467 --> 01:00:16.434
and then there's a bunch of
seemingly random characters.

01:00:16.434 --> 01:00:20.634
To show you,
you can get to the Wave...

01:00:20.634 --> 01:00:22.934
Oh, what do you mean,
the Wave address?

01:00:22.934 --> 01:00:24.834
man: Like if you want to
replace email,

01:00:24.834 --> 01:00:26.767
you're gonna have to put
something on your business card.

01:00:26.767 --> 01:00:29.334
What's that gonna look like?

01:00:29.334 --> 01:00:33.801
Osinga: Oh, so right now,
we just use Google Accounts

01:00:33.801 --> 01:00:36.234
to log in and to communicate.

01:00:36.234 --> 01:00:37.834
I thought you were
talking about--

01:00:37.834 --> 01:00:40.234
so for embedding,
you need just Wave ID

01:00:40.234 --> 01:00:42.434
which you can get
from the debug menu here.

01:00:42.434 --> 01:00:44.033
I thought I showed it quickly,

01:00:44.033 --> 01:00:46.434
because some may want
to try with that.

01:00:46.434 --> 01:00:48.234
man: I mean more like
if I ran my own Wave Server,

01:00:48.234 --> 01:00:50.033
and I wanted people
to be able to email me where

01:00:50.033 --> 01:00:51.434
what would that look like?

01:00:51.434 --> 01:00:52.767
Would it look like
an email address?

01:00:52.767 --> 01:00:54.467
Would you guys have
the equivalent of MX records

01:00:54.467 --> 01:00:57.234
in the NS for waves?

01:00:57.234 --> 01:00:59.033
Osinga: Yes.

01:00:59.033 --> 01:01:01.901
Yeah. So yeah,
it looks like an email address.

01:01:01.901 --> 01:01:05.701
[man speaking indistinctly]

01:01:05.701 --> 01:01:08.267
Osinga: So yeah.

01:01:08.267 --> 01:01:10.868
It looks like an email address

01:01:10.868 --> 01:01:12.901
or that the convention is,
you know,

01:01:12.901 --> 01:01:15.334
it's user at...at a domain,
right?

01:01:15.334 --> 01:01:19.000
So you reach that user
using a protocol

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:20.501
at that domain,

01:01:20.501 --> 01:01:23.901
and the default is email
in a lot of people's heads,

01:01:23.901 --> 01:01:25.701
but we use the same convention.

01:01:25.701 --> 01:01:29.901
I think that's all we have
time for today.

01:01:29.901 --> 01:01:34.300
If you have more questions
and you can find me,

01:01:34.300 --> 01:01:35.300
ask them.

01:01:35.300 --> 01:01:37.501
[woman speaking indistinctly]

01:01:37.501 --> 01:01:39.534
[applause]

01:01:39.534 --> 01:01:42.434
I mentioned it twice.
