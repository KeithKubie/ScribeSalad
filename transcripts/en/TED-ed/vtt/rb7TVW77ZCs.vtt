00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:10.441
In 1796, the scientist Edward Jenner

00:00:10.441 --> 00:00:15.111
injected material from a cowpox virus
into an eight-year-old boy

00:00:15.111 --> 00:00:17.878
with a hunch that this would provide
the protection needed

00:00:17.878 --> 00:00:23.243
to save people from deadly outbreaks
of the related smallpox virus.

00:00:23.243 --> 00:00:24.890
It was a success.

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:27.619
The eight-year-old was inoculated
against the disease

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:30.930
and this became the first ever vaccine.

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:32.723
But why did it work?

00:00:32.723 --> 00:00:34.657
To understand how vaccines function,

00:00:34.657 --> 00:00:39.118
we need to know how the immune system
defends us against contagious diseases

00:00:39.118 --> 00:00:40.915
in the first place.

00:00:40.915 --> 00:00:43.071
When foreign microbes invade us,

00:00:43.071 --> 00:00:46.124
the immune system triggers
a series of responses

00:00:46.124 --> 00:00:49.756
in an attempt to identify
and remove them from our bodies.

00:00:49.756 --> 00:00:52.806
The signs that this immune
response is working

00:00:52.806 --> 00:00:57.500
are the coughing, sneezing,
inflammation and fever we experience,

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:03.414
which work to trap, deter and rid the body
of threatening things, like bacteria.

00:01:03.414 --> 00:01:07.824
These innate immune responses
also trigger our second line of defense,

00:01:07.824 --> 00:01:10.198
called adaptive immunity.

00:01:10.198 --> 00:01:15.113
Special cells called B cells and T cells
are recruited to fight microbes,

00:01:15.113 --> 00:01:18.331
and also record information about them,

00:01:18.331 --> 00:01:21.479
creating a memory of what
the invaders look like,

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.047
and how best to fight them.

00:01:24.047 --> 00:01:25.940
This know-how becomes handy

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:29.472
if the same pathogen
invades the body again.

00:01:29.472 --> 00:01:33.520
But despite this smart response,
there's still a risk involved.

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:36.696
The body takes time to learn
how to respond to pathogens

00:01:36.696 --> 00:01:38.757
and to build up these defenses.

00:01:38.757 --> 00:01:39.757
And even then,

00:01:39.767 --> 00:01:43.179
if a body is too weak or young
to fight back when it's invaded,

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:48.881
it might face very serious risk
if the pathogen is particularly severe.

00:01:48.881 --> 00:01:51.933
But what if we could prepare
the body's immune response,

00:01:51.933 --> 00:01:55.080
readying it before someone even got ill?

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:57.491
This is where vaccines come in.

00:01:57.491 --> 00:02:00.998
Using the same principles
that the body uses to defend itself,

00:02:00.998 --> 00:02:05.975
scientists use vaccines to trigger
the body's adaptive immune system,

00:02:05.975 --> 00:02:09.681
without exposing humans
to the full strength disease.

00:02:09.681 --> 00:02:13.559
This has resulted in many vaccines,
which each work uniquely,

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:16.067
separated into many different types.

00:02:16.067 --> 00:02:19.769
First, we have live attenuated vaccines.

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:24.748
These are made of the pathogen itself
but a much weaker and tamer version.

00:02:24.748 --> 00:02:29.499
Next, we have inactive vaccines,
in which the pathogens have been killed.

00:02:29.499 --> 00:02:32.528
The weakening and inactivation
in both types of vaccine

00:02:32.528 --> 00:02:36.438
ensures that pathogens don't develop
into the full blown disease.

00:02:36.438 --> 00:02:40.298
But just like a disease,
they trigger an immune response,

00:02:40.298 --> 00:02:42.452
teaching the body to recognize an attack

00:02:42.452 --> 00:02:46.248
by making a profile
of pathogens in preparation.

00:02:46.248 --> 00:02:51.049
The downside is that live attenuated
vaccines can be difficult to make,

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:53.249
and because they're live
and quite powerful,

00:02:53.249 --> 00:02:56.589
people with weaker immune systems
can't have them,

00:02:56.589 --> 00:03:00.963
while inactive vaccines
don't create long-lasting immunity.

00:03:00.963 --> 00:03:03.790
Another type, the subunit vaccine,

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:08.033
is only made from one part
of the pathogen, called an antigen,

00:03:08.033 --> 00:03:11.569
the ingredient that actually triggers
the immune response.

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:14.946
By even further isolating
specific components of antigens,

00:03:14.946 --> 00:03:17.383
like proteins or polysaccharides,

00:03:17.383 --> 00:03:21.753
these vaccines can prompt
specific responses.

00:03:21.753 --> 00:03:25.671
Scientists are now building
a whole new range of vaccines

00:03:25.671 --> 00:03:27.171
called DNA vaccines.

00:03:27.171 --> 00:03:32.029
For this variety, they isolate the very
genes that make the specific antigens

00:03:32.029 --> 00:03:36.566
the body needs to trigger its immune
response to specific pathogens.

00:03:36.566 --> 00:03:38.720
When injected into the human body,

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:42.538
those genes instruct cells
in the body to make the antigens.

00:03:42.538 --> 00:03:44.980
This causes a stronger immune response,

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:47.912
and prepares the body
for any future threats,

00:03:47.912 --> 00:03:51.382
and because the vaccine only includes
specific genetic material,

00:03:51.382 --> 00:03:55.004
it doesn't contain any other ingredients
from the rest of the pathogen

00:03:55.004 --> 00:03:58.605
that could develop into the disease
and harm the patient.

00:03:58.605 --> 00:04:00.881
If these vaccines become a success,

00:04:00.881 --> 00:04:03.515
we might be able to build
more effective treatments

00:04:03.515 --> 00:04:06.152
for invasive pathogens in years to come.

00:04:06.152 --> 00:04:08.370
Just like Edward Jenner's
amazing discovery

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:11.656
spurred on modern medicine
all those decades ago,

00:04:11.656 --> 00:04:13.685
continuing the development of vaccines

00:04:13.685 --> 00:04:16.894
might even allow us
to treat diseases like HIV,

00:04:16.894 --> 00:04:17.894
malaria,

00:04:17.898 --> 00:04:19.608
or Ebola, one day.
