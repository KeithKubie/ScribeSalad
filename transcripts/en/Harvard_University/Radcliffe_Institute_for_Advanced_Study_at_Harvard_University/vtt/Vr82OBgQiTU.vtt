00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.892
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.748 --> 00:00:08.210
- Hello.

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:13.880
First, I'm going to talk
briefly before I read my poems.

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:18.380
And my talk is inspired
by my Radcliffe Fellow

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:21.110
Fellows, many of
whom have expressed

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:24.860
to me over the past
nine months or so--

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:27.920
me, the lone poet
in the cohort--

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:30.920
that they wish that they
understood poetry better,

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:34.500
its meaning and its purpose.

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.660
I remember being out on
the lawn in Radcliffe yard

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:42.090
on a sunny September
day early on,

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.920
and one of these 50 fascinating
people who I had just met

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.580
was standing behind me
in the barbecue line.

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:54.170
And he asked me, how do
you know if a poem is good?

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:59.120
And I don't think I had a very
good answer to that question,

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.001
if I was able to answer at all.

00:01:01.001 --> 00:01:02.000
I really don't remember.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.420
But what I wish I had
said was, I don't.

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.050
Isn't that wonderful?

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:09.800
Because the first thing
that I want to say

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:13.610
about poetry is that a poem
is an utterly free space

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:17.720
for language, the only utterly
free space for language

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:19.340
that I'm aware of.

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.980
And that is what makes
it indispensable to me,

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:26.000
and also what
makes it political.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.770
When I first considered
what I wanted

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:31.370
to say about poetry to potential
readers who had not yet

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:33.860
found their way
there, my impulse

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:37.750
was to write a manifesto
or even a rant.

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:40.760
But then I thought maybe that
we hear quite enough ranting

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:42.050
these days.

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:45.920
And maybe the rant is devalued
right now, like a currency.

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:51.860
So maybe another mode I
felt would be more useful

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:53.910
and buy more.

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:57.350
So I decided instead to
ask some questions, which

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:00.920
is poetry's most important job
anyway, to get you to listen

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.560
and to get you to wonder.

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.350
So who really
listens to a shouter,

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:09.320
and who wonders on command?

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:11.930
It's my hope that
questions, like a poem,

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:14.060
will be more effective
in getting the mind

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.670
to participate in making
the meaning of what I want

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:19.370
to see here, because
another thing

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.410
that I believe about
poems is that they,

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:25.130
more than any
other kind of text,

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:30.110
invite or even demand
that their readers lean in

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:34.280
and become active participants
in the joyful task of making

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.850
meaning, another reason why
reading or writing poetry

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:41.260
is a political action.

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:42.850
Before I get to the
questions, I want

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:46.780
to point out that poetry
seems to get attention

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:52.260
in the mainstream culture in
only two sets of circumstances.

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.190
First, every year or so, The
New York Times or The Atlantic

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:59.970
or some other media outlet
with cultural prestige

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:02.670
features an article
with a title like,

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.900
"Does Poetry Matter,"
or "Can Poetry Matter,"

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.320
or "Why Doesn't Poetry
Matter Anymore?"

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:12.480
And then the second
set of circumstances

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.930
is in times of public
trauma or crisis,

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:20.710
like our current trauma or
like the aftermath of 9/11,

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:22.230
The New York Times
or The Atlantic

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:25.650
or some other media outlet
with cultural prestige features

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:29.130
an article with a blunt
title like, "Americans Turn

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:32.910
to Poetry in Times of
Crisis," as if to keep us

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:34.890
from panicking, it's
time to break out

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:38.490
the poems like expired
Ativans that have been sitting

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:41.510
in the nightstand drawer.

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:44.690
Both kinds of articles
diminish the value of poetry.

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:48.890
And if my questions do take
a ranting or political tone,

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:51.410
it's this mainstream
diminishment

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:53.450
that I'm talking back to.

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:56.510
After all, The New York
Times never asks, does

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:00.470
football matter or
do restaurants matter

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:02.420
or does television matter?

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:06.500
So here are my questions.

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:10.940
How many people have to read a
poem to make it worth writing?

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:13.580
Do the people have to be
alive at the time the poem is

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:15.050
written?

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:18.000
Does it matter that the Super
Bowl will always have more fans

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.250
than any poem I write?

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:22.470
If you think maybe
it does matter,

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:25.080
do you apply this
capitalist mode of value

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.690
to everything in your life?

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:31.520
How impoverished would
your life be if you did?

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:35.145
Would poetry be more valued
if it cost more and took up

00:04:35.145 --> 00:04:35.645
more space?

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:41.570
Isn't it cool that poetry
is the ultimate reality

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:46.010
show, a site for confusion,
ambivalence, complexity,

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:50.560
uncertainty, and big
and tiny feelings?

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:54.550
Isn't it cool that in a world
of increasing specialization,

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:57.280
a poet is the
ultimate generalist,

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:00.160
whose area is nothing
less general than what

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:03.610
it feels like to be human?

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:07.220
Could poetry have begun as
the chanting of vowel sounds

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:12.900
around a communal fire,
or by mothers to infants?

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:14.540
Which is more
important, your mother

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:19.000
singing to you or your mother
telling you to eat your beets?

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.340
Which came first?

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:24.110
Which is more
fundamental to you?

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:26.930
Which makes you human?

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:30.310
The poetry I love most,
as Judy so acutely pointed

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:32.620
out, partakes of song.

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:35.320
If you like music and
you like language,

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:36.520
you're the target market.

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:41.680
If a society doesn't
value poetry,

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:43.930
the most essential art--

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:46.690
I may be biased about that--

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:49.510
because it is solely made
from the very language that

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:55.570
makes us human, is poetry fucked
up or is the society fucked up?

00:05:55.570 --> 00:06:00.190
Do we have other evidence
that our society is fucked up?

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:02.170
Is it possible
everything that can

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:04.750
be done is being
done to numb you

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:07.150
to the essential and
infinitely subtle

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:10.740
suffering and joy
of being alive?

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:13.740
Is it possible that
poetry wants to awaken

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:17.040
your awareness of the
essential and infinitely subtle

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:20.760
joy and suffering
of being alive?

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:24.150
Is it possible that poetry can
awaken you without telling you

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:27.270
exactly how?

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:30.790
Do we need to
discuss difficulty?

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:33.430
Is difficulty something
to discuss or something

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:37.110
to experience, or both?

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:39.840
Has your life been
without difficulty?

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:42.070
Do you know from difficulty?

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:45.570
Poems know from difficulty too.

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:50.300
Why shouldn't a poem create
a space for difficulty?

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:53.240
Paraphrasing the poet
Catherine Wagner,

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:55.400
do you like
understanding so much

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:59.670
you want it to
happen over and over?

00:06:59.670 --> 00:07:03.000
Could it be that not
understanding or wondering

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:07.510
is more honest and even
less violent than knowing?

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:10.450
If you can't go that far, is
it possible at least every

00:07:10.450 --> 00:07:12.880
once in a while?

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:17.620
Can something be difficult
and also a pleasure?

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:19.570
Could part of
poetry's difficulty

00:07:19.570 --> 00:07:21.670
be that poems are
made from something

00:07:21.670 --> 00:07:23.800
we've depended on
since toddlerhood

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:27.130
to communicate our basic needs?

00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:29.480
Is it a little
disconcerting to encounter

00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:31.870
a language that doesn't
have so much interest

00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:35.750
in informational exchange?

00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:37.700
Could it be OK that
language can be

00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:41.090
used to communicate basic
physical and emotional needs,

00:07:41.090 --> 00:07:45.710
and information, and also to
make crafted objects, i.e.

00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:47.820
poems?

00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:49.030
Some water you drink.

00:07:49.030 --> 00:07:50.500
Some water you swim in.

00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:55.460
Some water sprays up out
of an ornamental fountain.

00:07:55.460 --> 00:07:58.170
Can you enjoy an art
form that uses language

00:07:58.170 --> 00:08:00.970
like paint on a canvas?

00:08:00.970 --> 00:08:03.580
Can you enjoy an art
form that uses language

00:08:03.580 --> 00:08:07.040
like notes on a staff?

00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:09.440
Can you enjoy an art
form that uses language

00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:12.380
to make a frame for a
picture that never quite gets

00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:15.530
hung at the museum?

00:08:15.530 --> 00:08:19.920
Could it be OK to use
language to give pleasure?

00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:23.230
Could this pleasure be
an act of resistance,

00:08:23.230 --> 00:08:27.360
resistance against the
debasement of language?

00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:31.110
Are you starting to
want some answers?

00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:33.270
Here's one possible answer.

00:08:33.270 --> 00:08:35.669
Poetry opens up
spaces for language

00:08:35.669 --> 00:08:37.799
that echo through centuries.

00:08:37.799 --> 00:08:42.659
Poetry is the fresh stream that
feeds the lake of language.

00:08:42.659 --> 00:08:45.510
Other streams also
pour into the lake,

00:08:45.510 --> 00:08:48.210
with waters not so
fresh and lively.

00:08:48.210 --> 00:08:49.710
In fact, some of
the other streams

00:08:49.710 --> 00:08:52.860
are dull or toxic or fake.

00:08:52.860 --> 00:08:57.180
Poetry replenishes and
restores the lake of language.

00:08:57.180 --> 00:09:00.290
Do you need fresh water only
under drought conditions,

00:09:00.290 --> 00:09:03.040
or do you need it all the time?

00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:06.730
Even if you don't drink directly
from the spring of poetry,

00:09:06.730 --> 00:09:08.500
you drink from the
lake of language

00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:11.350
the spring has
fed and sweetened.

00:09:11.350 --> 00:09:13.960
Even if you don't read
poetry, I assure you

00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:16.840
that poetry is whispering
to you and maybe

00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:19.040
waiting for you to jump in.

00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:19.540
Thank you.

00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:22.516
[APPLAUSE]

00:09:25.984 --> 00:09:26.484
Thanks.

00:09:29.956 --> 00:09:30.470
Thank you.

00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:34.160
So now let's see if
I can walk the walk.

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:37.370
The first poem I'm going
to read is the first poem

00:09:37.370 --> 00:09:42.030
I wrote here at Radcliffe,
in my office in Byerly Hall.

00:09:42.030 --> 00:09:44.090
And I found that
because I suddenly

00:09:44.090 --> 00:09:47.030
had such oodles
of time to write,

00:09:47.030 --> 00:09:51.890
this poem rejected my usual
urge to compress and distill.

00:09:51.890 --> 00:09:55.160
And instead, I allowed myself
to go on every tangent that

00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:59.240
occurred to me and make lots
of long digressions, which

00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:02.180
happen on the page
between parentheses,

00:10:02.180 --> 00:10:05.750
so you'll hear them as
like frequent interruptions

00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:08.480
in the poem's basic narrative.

00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:13.190
And for anyone who is familiar
with Elizabeth Bishop's poetry,

00:10:13.190 --> 00:10:17.710
the echoes of her that you
hear are very intentional.

00:10:17.710 --> 00:10:20.410
It's called-- this is
maybe a little daring

00:10:20.410 --> 00:10:23.770
to lead with a poem
called "On Boredom,"

00:10:23.770 --> 00:10:26.870
but yes, my first poem
is called "On Boredom."

00:10:29.670 --> 00:10:33.640
"One Saturday, Saturday
when my time comes,

00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:36.940
among my last thoughts will
be that I did not fully

00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:39.310
appreciate Saturdays.

00:10:39.310 --> 00:10:42.610
My aunt Anne, who
died this month,

00:10:42.610 --> 00:10:47.080
took me to my first Broadway
show, 'Fiddler on the Roof.'

00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:50.500
She took me and five
cousins on an early morning

00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:55.420
bus from the Albany Trailways
station to Port Authority.

00:10:55.420 --> 00:10:59.820
She treated us to lunch,
and then to a matinee.

00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:02.820
I ate fried chicken
for lunch, a food

00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:07.110
I now abhor for reasons
of taste and ethics,

00:11:07.110 --> 00:11:10.710
neither of my well-doing,
but products of the passage

00:11:10.710 --> 00:11:13.020
of time and consciousness.

00:11:13.020 --> 00:11:17.370
Then I was beguiled by the
red plastic basket where

00:11:17.370 --> 00:11:22.140
the golden chicken rested, and
had an orange drink and Junior

00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:24.330
Mints in the theater.

00:11:24.330 --> 00:11:28.410
Of the show, I remember
'Matchmaker, Matchmaker,' and

00:11:28.410 --> 00:11:31.950
how the three daughters found
their matches, true love,

00:11:31.950 --> 00:11:36.030
which of course came with
the iconic problems, money,

00:11:36.030 --> 00:11:38.190
religion, politics.

00:11:38.190 --> 00:11:41.580
But we, the audience,
knew an inescapable pair

00:11:41.580 --> 00:11:43.380
when we saw it.

00:11:43.380 --> 00:11:47.690
I was only nine, but wished
that I could be a pair too.

00:11:47.690 --> 00:11:49.920
What a limited life I had.

00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:50.730
I was nine.

00:11:50.730 --> 00:11:53.490
I didn't know any
Jews, though I'd later

00:11:53.490 --> 00:11:56.100
marry a Jew, who
has sheltered me

00:11:56.100 --> 00:11:59.790
from my chronic problems, who
has worked so I could work

00:11:59.790 --> 00:12:03.210
on poems that don't earn money.

00:12:03.210 --> 00:12:06.360
Sitting in the dark full of
chicken and sweetness made

00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:10.620
me drowsy and dull, my
critical sense, such as it

00:12:10.620 --> 00:12:13.830
was at nine, absolutely dulled.

00:12:13.830 --> 00:12:17.190
To this day, I can't sit in
a theater and feel anything

00:12:17.190 --> 00:12:20.220
but grateful to the
actors and musicians.

00:12:20.220 --> 00:12:22.890
I have no critical sense.

00:12:22.890 --> 00:12:25.020
This was not the
kind of boredom I

00:12:25.020 --> 00:12:29.520
had felt the year before at the
Baseball Hall of Fame, where

00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:32.970
my father, Aunt Anne's
brother, who has seen me

00:12:32.970 --> 00:12:36.930
through life to this day,
has cushioned me through,

00:12:36.930 --> 00:12:40.950
led me around a room filled
with nothing more entertaining

00:12:40.950 --> 00:12:44.930
than three walls
of bronze plaques.

00:12:44.930 --> 00:12:47.300
This was not that
kind of boredom.

00:12:47.300 --> 00:12:50.930
It was boredom of my
will doing, abstracted

00:12:50.930 --> 00:12:55.850
extravagance, a red velvet
cushion cocoon of mindlessness.

00:12:55.850 --> 00:12:59.150
This sumptuous mindlessness
is what I cultivate

00:12:59.150 --> 00:13:02.830
when I let a poem begin.

00:13:02.830 --> 00:13:05.440
Unlike the show's
three daughters,

00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:07.900
Aunt Anne was not a pair.

00:13:07.900 --> 00:13:11.530
She was an unmarried
woman, considered pitiable

00:13:11.530 --> 00:13:14.470
in that family and at that time.

00:13:14.470 --> 00:13:17.350
She lived all her
life with her parents,

00:13:17.350 --> 00:13:19.690
and after they died, alone.

00:13:19.690 --> 00:13:22.630
She enjoyed theater
and gambling--

00:13:22.630 --> 00:13:26.080
also took me to my
first bingo night--

00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:29.740
and vivid conversations around
her mother's kitchen table,

00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:31.450
later hers.

00:13:31.450 --> 00:13:35.590
Every Sunday there I was,
bored by the grownup talk

00:13:35.590 --> 00:13:39.250
and breathing secondhand
cigarette smoke.

00:13:39.250 --> 00:13:43.210
What a limited life she had
with her fire and ice lipstick

00:13:43.210 --> 00:13:45.370
and heavy gold bangles.

00:13:45.370 --> 00:13:47.930
Didn't she have ambitions?

00:13:47.930 --> 00:13:52.420
I think she was ambitious to
take six kids all that way.

00:13:52.420 --> 00:13:56.260
Must ambitious-- must
ambition be performance?

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:59.590
Does ambition only count
if many people see?

00:13:59.590 --> 00:14:01.660
Many needs defining.

00:14:01.660 --> 00:14:06.290
And if the people aren't
your immediate family?

00:14:06.290 --> 00:14:09.950
After the show, we boarded
a crowded Trailways bus

00:14:09.950 --> 00:14:11.360
back home.

00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:14.590
We kids were sleepy,
wired, and fractious.

00:14:14.590 --> 00:14:19.970
The seats in pairs, I had to sit
next to a stranger, a man who

00:14:19.970 --> 00:14:23.840
looked to a nine-year-old who
didn't know any professors

00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:25.740
like a professor.

00:14:25.740 --> 00:14:30.960
He wore dark-framed glasses
like my father's, a tweed cap.

00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:34.170
The little pinpoint
light shone down on him.

00:14:34.170 --> 00:14:37.830
He read first a magazine
and then a book.

00:14:37.830 --> 00:14:43.350
He had a leather briefcase
full of books and magazines.

00:14:43.350 --> 00:14:46.530
I had nothing to
read but my playbill.

00:14:46.530 --> 00:14:49.410
I read front to back,
then back to front,

00:14:49.410 --> 00:14:51.840
then started over again.

00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:55.380
The man, although absorbed
in his own reading,

00:14:55.380 --> 00:14:59.010
must have noticed, because he
took the magazine, National

00:14:59.010 --> 00:15:03.510
Geographic, out from his
briefcase and gave it to me.

00:15:03.510 --> 00:15:08.580
Maybe you'd like to
read this, he smiled.

00:15:08.580 --> 00:15:12.480
In Citizen Kane, a movie
I watched with my father

00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:15.150
and which didn't bore
me, the accountant

00:15:15.150 --> 00:15:19.350
talks about seeing a woman in
a white dress one day when he

00:15:19.350 --> 00:15:22.230
was 17, and then never again.

00:15:22.230 --> 00:15:27.070
But not a month goes by
that I don't think of her.

00:15:27.070 --> 00:15:30.490
This is supposed to
be a doleful mystery.

00:15:30.490 --> 00:15:33.040
He only saw her once.

00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:34.990
It's not mysterious.

00:15:34.990 --> 00:15:37.000
It is perfectly clear.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.160
The woman was his creation.

00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:42.090
He conjured her from boredom.

00:15:42.090 --> 00:15:45.510
Clarity, what use
are you to me now?

00:15:45.510 --> 00:15:47.460
My mystery is this.

00:15:47.460 --> 00:15:49.830
How many days were
blank of thought

00:15:49.830 --> 00:15:53.520
about Aunt Anne, who
gave me this memory poem,

00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:56.070
or about my father,
who gave me leisure

00:15:56.070 --> 00:16:00.390
to think about my inner life
instead of about hardships

00:16:00.390 --> 00:16:04.050
and displacement,
leisure to be bored.

00:16:04.050 --> 00:16:07.060
Bored is a withdrawal
of attention.

00:16:07.060 --> 00:16:07.860
Pay attention.

00:16:10.620 --> 00:16:13.320
My aunt and cousins
in the back of the bus

00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:17.190
were sleeping, snuffling
close but separate,

00:16:17.190 --> 00:16:21.010
dreaming privately,
thrilling dreams probably,

00:16:21.010 --> 00:16:25.650
for dreams are never boring,
unlike the magazine so

00:16:25.650 --> 00:16:30.300
kindly offered but photo
of bleak hot desert,

00:16:30.300 --> 00:16:34.110
photo of frozen
mountain, so boring.

00:16:34.110 --> 00:16:37.710
My eyes were dim with sleepiness
and the strain of reading

00:16:37.710 --> 00:16:42.630
in the dark and something else,
a look I carry to this day,

00:16:42.630 --> 00:16:47.070
no matter what I'm reading, even
when I'm reading, that says,

00:16:47.070 --> 00:16:51.390
hungry, hungry, please won't
you give me something to read?"

00:16:56.450 --> 00:16:59.830
So the next two poems
I'm going to read also

00:16:59.830 --> 00:17:03.010
have an early fall
semester connection.

00:17:03.010 --> 00:17:06.609
Back in August I think
it was, I got an email

00:17:06.609 --> 00:17:10.300
from Meg Rotzel asking me
to contribute something

00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:12.430
to the gallery
exhibit that was meant

00:17:12.430 --> 00:17:16.240
to showcase the work of
the incoming Fellows.

00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:18.910
And I couldn't imagine
what I could possibly

00:17:18.910 --> 00:17:22.720
send to her that she would want
to put on the wall of an art

00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:24.460
gallery and told her so.

00:17:24.460 --> 00:17:27.099
And she just sort of
persisted and encouraged

00:17:27.099 --> 00:17:29.980
me to think of something
with a visual element.

00:17:29.980 --> 00:17:33.100
And finally, I thought
of these next two poems.

00:17:33.100 --> 00:17:35.890
They appear in my most
recent book, The Do-Over.

00:17:35.890 --> 00:17:37.570
And they do have
a visual element,

00:17:37.570 --> 00:17:41.440
because they're acrostics,
which mean that they spell out

00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:43.540
the name of their subject.

00:17:43.540 --> 00:17:47.590
They're part of a little suite
of elegies for famous people

00:17:47.590 --> 00:17:51.160
that appear in the book, which
is an exploration of death

00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:54.370
in a variety of forms.

00:17:54.370 --> 00:17:58.520
Acrostics as a form were widely
used in 19th century mourning

00:17:58.520 --> 00:17:59.540
poetry.

00:17:59.540 --> 00:18:02.300
And they seem to form a
kind of like gravestone

00:18:02.300 --> 00:18:04.910
on the page, a kind
of engraved monument

00:18:04.910 --> 00:18:06.920
to the one who has gone.

00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:10.570
And I'm going to show
you the first one now.

00:18:10.570 --> 00:18:14.130
So you can see this is a
poem for Amy Winehouse.

00:18:14.130 --> 00:18:20.100
And you can see how in the
left column if you read down,

00:18:20.100 --> 00:18:22.170
it spells out her name.

00:18:22.170 --> 00:18:24.030
And so the other
Radcliffe connection

00:18:24.030 --> 00:18:29.820
with this poem and the
companion poem that goes with it

00:18:29.820 --> 00:18:33.480
is that I've been working with
my research partner, Daniela

00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:37.580
Muhleisen to translate
the book into Spanish.

00:18:37.580 --> 00:18:39.960
And she has done
such an amazing job

00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:45.150
of rising to the challenge of
putting up with my insistence

00:18:45.150 --> 00:18:49.650
on complicated forms like this,
and also maintaining the music

00:18:49.650 --> 00:18:51.810
and the content of these poems.

00:18:51.810 --> 00:18:54.240
So I'm going to read
this one and then I'm

00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:58.860
going to ask her to come up
and read the translation, which

00:18:58.860 --> 00:19:03.690
you'll also see next, and
then another acrostic elegy

00:19:03.690 --> 00:19:06.234
and the translation for that.

00:19:06.234 --> 00:19:13.770
So "Amy Winehouse.

00:19:13.770 --> 00:19:17.640
All song is formal and
you maybe felt this

00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:22.590
and decided you'd be formal
too, the eyeliner, the beehive,

00:19:22.590 --> 00:19:24.600
formal.

00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:29.430
When a desire to escape
becomes formal, it's dangerous.

00:19:29.430 --> 00:19:33.210
Then escape requires
nullity, rather than

00:19:33.210 --> 00:19:35.860
a walk in the park or a movie.

00:19:35.860 --> 00:19:41.370
Eventually, nullity gets
harder and harder to achieve.

00:19:41.370 --> 00:19:45.090
After surgery, I had opiates.

00:19:45.090 --> 00:19:48.680
I pushed the button
as often as I could.

00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:53.090
Understood by music was
how I felt, an escape so

00:19:53.090 --> 00:19:55.910
complete it became a song.

00:19:55.910 --> 00:20:00.260
After that, elegy's the
only necessary form."

00:20:03.090 --> 00:20:04.800
- Amy Winehouse.

00:20:04.800 --> 00:21:00.060
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:21:00.060 --> 00:21:03.006
[APPLAUSE]

00:21:08.407 --> 00:21:13.080
- And the next little
elegy is for Donna Summer.

00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:17.920
"Discourse that night concerned
the warm-blooded love we felt.

00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:22.810
On the divan in the bar room
and on the terrace, we felt it.

00:21:22.810 --> 00:21:27.540
Now virtue meant liking the
look of the face we lay next to.

00:21:27.540 --> 00:21:30.660
Never mind the staying
of the winter solstice.

00:21:30.660 --> 00:21:34.080
All discourse that night
concerned the warm-blooded love

00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:38.540
we felt. Something
lifted us higher,

00:21:38.540 --> 00:21:43.370
her little finger told her so,
untangling with careless skill

00:21:43.370 --> 00:21:46.430
the flora of the sexual grove.

00:21:46.430 --> 00:21:49.160
Master physician
with a masterly joy

00:21:49.160 --> 00:21:52.610
in wrapping up mud-spattered
coke-dusted wounds

00:21:52.610 --> 00:21:57.950
at midnight, when it's too early
to stop dancing and go home.

00:21:57.950 --> 00:22:02.030
Our lily-minds
soothed by her royalty

00:22:02.030 --> 00:22:06.410
concealed in the synthesizers in
the flora of the sexual grove."

00:22:09.050 --> 00:22:10.750
- Donna Summer.

00:22:10.750 --> 00:23:10.948
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:23:10.948 --> 00:23:13.338
[APPLAUSE]

00:23:20.980 --> 00:23:21.480
- OK.

00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:26.900
So the next poem
is what I spent--

00:23:26.900 --> 00:23:30.060
or excerpts from what I spent
the bulk of last semester

00:23:30.060 --> 00:23:34.290
writing, which is a long
diary poem based on notes

00:23:34.290 --> 00:23:37.260
I had made last July
during a road trip

00:23:37.260 --> 00:23:39.330
I took with my daughter.

00:23:39.330 --> 00:23:41.490
It was the summer before
she went to college,

00:23:41.490 --> 00:23:42.750
and we decided--

00:23:42.750 --> 00:23:45.850
we're a family who
loves nutty road trips,

00:23:45.850 --> 00:23:48.360
so we decided we
were going to drive

00:23:48.360 --> 00:23:53.550
from the northernmost point in
the continental United States

00:23:53.550 --> 00:23:57.430
to the southernmost point.

00:23:57.430 --> 00:24:00.700
So I want to share a little
of that diary poem, which

00:24:00.700 --> 00:24:04.270
turned out to be so much
more epic than I ever

00:24:04.270 --> 00:24:05.470
dreamed it was going to be.

00:24:05.470 --> 00:24:08.420
But that's the result
of having all this time.

00:24:08.420 --> 00:24:12.760
It's clocking in right
now at around 50 pages.

00:24:12.760 --> 00:24:17.170
There's an entry for almost
every day in July, 2016.

00:24:17.170 --> 00:24:19.360
And the poem is
written in diary form,

00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:22.690
with the date and the
location as headers.

00:24:22.690 --> 00:24:25.720
There are prose sections,
sections written

00:24:25.720 --> 00:24:28.810
in syllabic verse,
and some freestanding

00:24:28.810 --> 00:24:34.000
poems with separate titles
that kind of act as lyric

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:38.870
interludes apart from or in
counterpoint to the diary

00:24:38.870 --> 00:24:40.510
sections.

00:24:40.510 --> 00:24:44.740
And because of the time,
July 2016, and the places,

00:24:44.740 --> 00:24:47.950
basically the heart
of the United States

00:24:47.950 --> 00:24:51.490
where we were traveling, it
is a mother-daughter story,

00:24:51.490 --> 00:24:52.930
but it's also more.

00:24:52.930 --> 00:24:58.200
And there is a lot of
political reverberations.

00:24:58.200 --> 00:25:01.620
My daughter's name is Muriel,
and she's usually called Murie

00:25:01.620 --> 00:25:04.470
in the poem and in real life.

00:25:04.470 --> 00:25:06.750
And my husband's name
is Rob, and he was there

00:25:06.750 --> 00:25:08.750
for part of the trip.

00:25:08.750 --> 00:25:12.000
So July-- ooh.

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:13.590
Let me get rid of this.

00:25:17.020 --> 00:25:20.200
"July 16th, Branson,
Missouri,"--

00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:22.480
which I don't know if
anyone has ever been there,

00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:25.780
but it's basically-- yeah.

00:25:25.780 --> 00:25:31.240
It's basically the like
Las Vegas of the Ozarks.

00:25:31.240 --> 00:25:35.770
So Branson, Missouri.

00:25:35.770 --> 00:25:41.080
"I woke up to Rob's salty
smell and the fucking sun.

00:25:41.080 --> 00:25:45.010
Replica of Empire State
Building topped by King Kong.

00:25:45.010 --> 00:25:47.260
At first, I think it's
the World Trade Center

00:25:47.260 --> 00:25:49.930
tower with its plume of smoke.

00:25:49.930 --> 00:25:52.090
Replica of Titanic.

00:25:52.090 --> 00:25:53.980
We're each given
a passenger's name

00:25:53.980 --> 00:25:56.110
and have to wait until
the end of the tour

00:25:56.110 --> 00:25:58.690
to find out whether we survive.

00:25:58.690 --> 00:26:00.190
I survive.

00:26:00.190 --> 00:26:01.810
Murie survives.

00:26:01.810 --> 00:26:05.590
Rob, as a male crewmember,
doesn't survive.

00:26:05.590 --> 00:26:07.030
Toy museum.

00:26:07.030 --> 00:26:09.360
Quotes from Bible on walls.

00:26:09.360 --> 00:26:12.820
BB gun annex,
segregated cabinets

00:26:12.820 --> 00:26:15.940
with black Sambo and
Aunt Jemima dolls,

00:26:15.940 --> 00:26:19.310
careless piles, dusty
board games, unloved dolls.

00:26:21.850 --> 00:26:24.930
What I thought I had learned
about towns, where there

00:26:24.930 --> 00:26:28.460
is money, towns are pleasant,
and where there is no money,

00:26:28.460 --> 00:26:30.710
towns are unpleasant.

00:26:30.710 --> 00:26:34.095
But there has to
be a quietness too.

00:26:34.095 --> 00:26:39.450
We play mini golf, our family
sport, at Pirate's Cove."

00:26:39.450 --> 00:26:42.420
And then here is one of
the standalone poems,

00:26:42.420 --> 00:26:45.780
which is called "Mini Golf."

00:26:45.780 --> 00:26:49.320
"The object of the game
is to be a family sport.

00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:53.590
The object of a family
is to self-destruct.

00:26:53.590 --> 00:26:55.840
Mini golf, like
a family, creates

00:26:55.840 --> 00:26:58.650
its own artificial world.

00:26:58.650 --> 00:27:03.540
Mini golf, like a family,
trades in myths and legends.

00:27:03.540 --> 00:27:08.360
In both, there is the illusion
of individuality, club heights,

00:27:08.360 --> 00:27:13.120
ball colors, contradiction,
rebellion, separation.

00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:16.750
Both are at their most
intense in summer.

00:27:16.750 --> 00:27:19.390
Money troubles tend
to disrupt each.

00:27:19.390 --> 00:27:22.990
The mini golf boom of the early
20th century came to an end

00:27:22.990 --> 00:27:28.070
during the economic
depression in the late 1930s.

00:27:28.070 --> 00:27:30.260
Mini golf and
families are for those

00:27:30.260 --> 00:27:32.810
who wish the past different.

00:27:32.810 --> 00:27:35.390
Mini golf was invented
in the United States,

00:27:35.390 --> 00:27:38.010
as was my family.

00:27:38.010 --> 00:27:41.700
The object of the United
States is to self-destruct.

00:27:41.700 --> 00:27:45.300
Can I prevent it with my
pink putter and orange ball,

00:27:45.300 --> 00:27:47.550
driving into the
artificial sand trap

00:27:47.550 --> 00:27:51.465
or farther, far into the myth of
the unblemished bloody summer?"

00:27:56.240 --> 00:27:58.700
"July 25th, Key West, Florida."

00:27:58.700 --> 00:28:00.670
That was our final destination.

00:28:03.260 --> 00:28:06.320
"Posh white town with
a mask of slackerdom.

00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:07.700
Somebody made the money.

00:28:07.700 --> 00:28:10.380
Who and how?

00:28:10.380 --> 00:28:13.290
Bernie addressing
the DNC now, a moment

00:28:13.290 --> 00:28:15.990
that could or should have been.

00:28:15.990 --> 00:28:19.320
Murie says they
all sound so fake.

00:28:19.320 --> 00:28:21.930
I'm reading books of poetry
like they're clementines

00:28:21.930 --> 00:28:23.680
and I have scurvy.

00:28:23.680 --> 00:28:28.780
Spahr, Buffam, Schiff,
Mayer, white women.

00:28:28.780 --> 00:28:33.640
There's whiskey in the jar,
Confederate flag on the car.

00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:35.590
Roosters strutting
around Old Town

00:28:35.590 --> 00:28:40.900
remind me of Elizabeth
Bishop's war poem, white women.

00:28:40.900 --> 00:28:43.000
Walk to southernmost point.

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:45.430
Waves slap the
embankment and we slap

00:28:45.430 --> 00:28:48.040
the concrete buoy monument.

00:28:48.040 --> 00:28:49.960
Made it.

00:28:49.960 --> 00:28:52.630
We produced by far the
most progressive platform

00:28:52.630 --> 00:28:54.430
in the history of
the Democratic Party,

00:28:54.430 --> 00:28:59.010
says Bernie, I am proud
to stand with her."

00:28:59.010 --> 00:29:04.100
This is a little standalone
poem, "On Gender."

00:29:04.100 --> 00:29:07.340
"I said to Murie
over key lime pie

00:29:07.340 --> 00:29:10.340
that we need more
feminine energy in power

00:29:10.340 --> 00:29:12.740
to challenge the patriarchy.

00:29:12.740 --> 00:29:14.480
I meant Bernie.

00:29:14.480 --> 00:29:16.040
She disagreed.

00:29:16.040 --> 00:29:18.800
She doesn't think
anything is gendered.

00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:24.200
I modified, nurturing energy
instead of dominating energy.

00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:26.210
Then she could agree.

00:29:26.210 --> 00:29:29.060
Are mothers always a
mystery to daughters?

00:29:29.060 --> 00:29:30.080
I don't want to be.

00:29:33.300 --> 00:29:36.180
July 26th, Key West, Florida.

00:29:36.180 --> 00:29:38.380
Last night, the convention.

00:29:38.380 --> 00:29:40.170
I was so dispirited
that I wanted

00:29:40.170 --> 00:29:44.250
to open the bottle of $2 Chuck
the Miami Airbnb host left

00:29:44.250 --> 00:29:46.440
and drink myself to sleep.

00:29:46.440 --> 00:29:47.640
Today I'm more resigned.

00:29:47.640 --> 00:29:51.830
And because we have to move on
into the future, I have hope.

00:29:51.830 --> 00:29:54.690
Murie in pain from
her period today.

00:29:54.690 --> 00:29:57.150
We did next to nothing,
late brunch and visit

00:29:57.150 --> 00:29:58.710
to Hemingway's house.

00:29:58.710 --> 00:30:02.700
Highlight, the six-toed
cats, of course.

00:30:02.700 --> 00:30:04.560
Dropped Murie off
at our room, then

00:30:04.560 --> 00:30:07.790
walked to Elizabeth
Bishop's house."

00:30:07.790 --> 00:30:11.060
And this is a little poem
called "On Memory," and then

00:30:11.060 --> 00:30:12.710
in parentheses, "On Poetry."

00:30:12.710 --> 00:30:15.710
I couldn't decide.

00:30:15.710 --> 00:30:18.590
It seems to fit both.

00:30:18.590 --> 00:30:20.840
And the first line
is, "I remember it,"

00:30:20.840 --> 00:30:23.150
and that refers to
Elizabeth Bishop's house

00:30:23.150 --> 00:30:25.550
in Key West, which I walked to.

00:30:25.550 --> 00:30:28.550
"I remember it from
2000 as a white house

00:30:28.550 --> 00:30:31.550
with a very high
white fence around it.

00:30:31.550 --> 00:30:33.710
Either someone took
down the fence or else

00:30:33.710 --> 00:30:38.630
I'm misremembering, or maybe she
had two addresses in Key West.

00:30:38.630 --> 00:30:42.800
And my poem about the house with
the sign about dog sweaters,"

00:30:42.800 --> 00:30:47.390
found in my first book, "may
be a complete figment too.

00:30:47.390 --> 00:30:49.880
No sign except for one
next to the front door

00:30:49.880 --> 00:30:53.720
that said 'hippies use back
door' and a formal plaque

00:30:53.720 --> 00:30:54.890
on the gate.

00:30:54.890 --> 00:30:58.670
First I typed fate.

00:30:58.670 --> 00:31:01.830
In the noiseless siesta
streets, lots of meaty

00:31:01.830 --> 00:31:04.160
succulents, lots
of scattered stone.

00:31:08.150 --> 00:31:11.480
I remember a story I heard about
Elizabeth Bishop and her lover

00:31:11.480 --> 00:31:15.050
Louise Crane, how they bought
a house together in Key West

00:31:15.050 --> 00:31:16.970
and then Louise went
back to New York

00:31:16.970 --> 00:31:20.600
and Elizabeth wrote letter
to New York for her.

00:31:20.600 --> 00:31:23.600
In your next letter, I wish
you'd say where you are going

00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:25.490
and what you are doing.

00:31:25.490 --> 00:31:29.120
And then Elizabeth's surprised
Louise by paying a bit a visit

00:31:29.120 --> 00:31:31.790
and was in turn surprised
to find Louise in bed

00:31:31.790 --> 00:31:34.520
with a musician friend.

00:31:34.520 --> 00:31:36.470
When Elizabeth told
the story afterwards,

00:31:36.470 --> 00:31:39.070
she named Billie Holiday.

00:31:39.070 --> 00:31:42.040
Then I remember her poem
with the cringe-worthy title

00:31:42.040 --> 00:31:44.710
"Songs for a Colored Singer."

00:31:44.710 --> 00:31:48.610
The time has come to call
a halt, and so it ends.

00:31:48.610 --> 00:31:51.550
Then I remember how tired
I am of sleeping alone.

00:31:56.800 --> 00:31:59.650
Mary and I talked about
how to deal with her period

00:31:59.650 --> 00:32:00.850
at college.

00:32:00.850 --> 00:32:04.570
Like me, she has just
24 bad hours a month.

00:32:04.570 --> 00:32:06.490
She said she'll just
go to her classes

00:32:06.490 --> 00:32:09.490
and spend the rest of
the 24 hours in bed.

00:32:09.490 --> 00:32:12.100
I tell her about tribes that
have separate huts where

00:32:12.100 --> 00:32:15.700
menstruating women can be
outside of their daily lives,

00:32:15.700 --> 00:32:18.110
be taken care of
by the other women.

00:32:18.110 --> 00:32:21.490
They also stay in bed, swaddled
along with their newborns,

00:32:21.490 --> 00:32:23.680
for a month after
they give birth.

00:32:23.680 --> 00:32:27.420
That always sounded right to me.

00:32:27.420 --> 00:32:31.560
Later we go out for ice cream,
sweat sluicing our backs.

00:32:31.560 --> 00:32:35.040
I ask for chocolate
amaretto in a cone.

00:32:35.040 --> 00:32:38.430
The depressed-looking manager,
a white guy around 60,

00:32:38.430 --> 00:32:42.840
says, the flavors with alcohol
are too soft for cones.

00:32:42.840 --> 00:32:46.010
I'm sure you know that
alcohol doesn't freeze,

00:32:46.010 --> 00:32:48.420
a futile bit of information.

00:32:48.420 --> 00:32:49.610
No, I didn't know.

00:32:49.610 --> 00:32:51.420
But OK.

00:32:51.420 --> 00:32:54.360
He looks at me blankly
and offers to accommodate,

00:32:54.360 --> 00:32:58.440
ice cream in a dish
with cone stuck on top."

00:32:58.440 --> 00:33:04.030
So the next poem is
outside of that diary poem.

00:33:04.030 --> 00:33:07.430
It comes from the domestic
experience, which we probably

00:33:07.430 --> 00:33:09.890
all had, of lifting
up a chair cushion

00:33:09.890 --> 00:33:12.860
and finding objects
underneath it.

00:33:12.860 --> 00:33:17.030
So I did that and
I took a picture,

00:33:17.030 --> 00:33:19.160
and I posted it on Facebook.

00:33:19.160 --> 00:33:21.470
And someone commented
that the picture looked

00:33:21.470 --> 00:33:23.900
like a Joseph Cornell box.

00:33:23.900 --> 00:33:25.550
And then I took a
closer look, and I

00:33:25.550 --> 00:33:28.130
did find a kind of
coherence and emotion

00:33:28.130 --> 00:33:29.400
in the grouping of objects.

00:33:29.400 --> 00:33:31.270
So I'm going to
show you the photo.

00:33:31.270 --> 00:33:32.770
Here we go.

00:33:32.770 --> 00:33:35.770
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:37.270 --> 00:33:40.570
So the poem is written
in a list form.

00:33:40.570 --> 00:33:45.850
I list each object and then
do a little riff on it.

00:33:45.850 --> 00:33:49.640
Don't judge me for my
poor housekeeping skills,

00:33:49.640 --> 00:33:53.150
and my poor housekeeping
skills are in the poem,

00:33:53.150 --> 00:33:55.480
so at least I'm honest about it.

00:33:55.480 --> 00:34:00.610
And the poem is called "Found
Under a Chair Cushion."

00:34:00.610 --> 00:34:05.280
"One, dark brown hair
tie, one of a set

00:34:05.280 --> 00:34:07.830
once primly wrapped
around a card

00:34:07.830 --> 00:34:12.750
in varying shades of brown meant
to match the ponytail of anyone

00:34:12.750 --> 00:34:16.219
who wanders into the CVS.

00:34:16.219 --> 00:34:19.639
I don't know what color
my hair is, so long have I

00:34:19.639 --> 00:34:23.929
paid to have it painted
gold as an October leaf

00:34:23.929 --> 00:34:28.500
when the pavement
is cool and wet.

00:34:28.500 --> 00:34:34.159
Two, Mad Men DVD,
season 1, disk 1.

00:34:34.159 --> 00:34:35.330
I tried to watch it.

00:34:35.330 --> 00:34:38.360
I really did.

00:34:38.360 --> 00:34:41.960
It turned into an elephant
lumbering toward me,

00:34:41.960 --> 00:34:46.370
then it tiptoed like a Disney
elephant, eyeing me coyly.

00:34:46.370 --> 00:34:49.969
But lumbering and
shilly-shallying are faddish.

00:34:49.969 --> 00:34:53.060
I wanted a bullet,
express and true.

00:34:53.060 --> 00:34:56.409
I've always been
a boy in that way.

00:34:56.409 --> 00:35:00.100
The boys on the disk
are splendid and shaved,

00:35:00.100 --> 00:35:04.030
in white shirts, courtiers
forming a circle around the sun

00:35:04.030 --> 00:35:05.410
king.

00:35:05.410 --> 00:35:08.680
While the velvet folds
of my spirit slept,

00:35:08.680 --> 00:35:12.340
I tried to believe I owed
it to my generation to act

00:35:12.340 --> 00:35:15.130
as a dutiful audience member.

00:35:15.130 --> 00:35:19.060
In other words, even in the
presence of the sun king,

00:35:19.060 --> 00:35:21.430
I tried being good,
but I got bored.

00:35:24.280 --> 00:35:28.420
Three, flyer for
house-cleaning service.

00:35:28.420 --> 00:35:32.380
Life's too short to
clean your own home.

00:35:32.380 --> 00:35:35.440
I agreed and the
family flew apart,

00:35:35.440 --> 00:35:38.990
couch flew apart, hand
towels flew apart.

00:35:38.990 --> 00:35:43.250
Dust overwhelms the
lungs twice daily.

00:35:43.250 --> 00:35:46.910
Homer, for example, has
never been out of print.

00:35:46.910 --> 00:35:50.690
Is it because he lacked
ambition for the clean life?

00:35:50.690 --> 00:35:54.470
Capitalism plus art plus
laziness, a dangerous formula.

00:35:57.180 --> 00:36:01.830
Four, seven dimes and one penny.

00:36:01.830 --> 00:36:05.820
Dimes are jewelry, pretty
beyond what monetary value

00:36:05.820 --> 00:36:07.590
we endow them with.

00:36:07.590 --> 00:36:12.780
With $0.71, I could buy
almost 3/4 of a Snickers bar,

00:36:12.780 --> 00:36:14.820
but I'm off sugar.

00:36:14.820 --> 00:36:19.830
$0.71 is what I'd need for 3 and
1/2 minutes of garage parking

00:36:19.830 --> 00:36:23.880
on 12th Street, while I teach
the willing and unwilling

00:36:23.880 --> 00:36:27.450
how to laugh and cry
about line breaks,

00:36:27.450 --> 00:36:32.210
or the amount I earn for
every $1 earned by a man,

00:36:32.210 --> 00:36:35.960
or shall I adorn myself
with coins, like a mad girl

00:36:35.960 --> 00:36:36.485
in tatters?

00:36:39.140 --> 00:36:42.350
Five, tweezer.

00:36:42.350 --> 00:36:43.970
It is time.

00:36:43.970 --> 00:36:47.270
It is time to wrench
out all the ugly hairs.

00:36:47.270 --> 00:36:49.255
The sun king approaches.

00:36:49.255 --> 00:36:53.135
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:53.135 --> 00:36:57.570
Six, red-haired
Playskool plastic kid,

00:36:57.570 --> 00:37:02.540
dressed in jeans and gray
hoodie, paint spattered.

00:37:02.540 --> 00:37:05.850
This small person
appears to be angry,

00:37:05.850 --> 00:37:09.390
having spent 10 years
under a chair cushion,

00:37:09.390 --> 00:37:13.110
having first suffered abuse
during some long forgotten

00:37:13.110 --> 00:37:14.880
crafts project.

00:37:14.880 --> 00:37:17.970
He is furious, but
is nevertheless

00:37:17.970 --> 00:37:19.410
giving me a thumbs-up."

00:37:19.410 --> 00:37:21.910
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:22.410 --> 00:37:25.110
Thank you for laughing.

00:37:25.110 --> 00:37:31.470
So the next poem is an example
of l'esprit de l'escalier.

00:37:31.470 --> 00:37:34.680
Some of you probably know that's
the French name for literally

00:37:34.680 --> 00:37:36.420
"the wit of the staircase."

00:37:36.420 --> 00:37:39.900
And it's the name for the
experience of thinking up

00:37:39.900 --> 00:37:43.440
the perfect retort
for something only

00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:47.760
after you've left the party
and are walking down stairs.

00:37:47.760 --> 00:37:49.830
A couple of years
ago, I gave a reading.

00:37:49.830 --> 00:37:53.040
And after the reading, a
poet who was in the audience

00:37:53.040 --> 00:37:56.520
came up to me and said,
your poems are good.

00:37:56.520 --> 00:37:58.920
Eccentric, but good.

00:37:58.920 --> 00:38:01.680
And so if I had come up with
the perfect response to that,

00:38:01.680 --> 00:38:05.940
I wouldn't have had
to write this poem.

00:38:05.940 --> 00:38:08.520
The poem references
Emily Dickinson

00:38:08.520 --> 00:38:12.600
and her habit of making little
crosses on her manuscripts

00:38:12.600 --> 00:38:15.910
to denote alternative words.

00:38:15.910 --> 00:38:19.319
So like she'd write a line and
put a little cross next to one

00:38:19.319 --> 00:38:19.860
of the words.

00:38:19.860 --> 00:38:22.140
And then somewhere
else on the page,

00:38:22.140 --> 00:38:26.490
she'd put another little
cross with an alternate word.

00:38:26.490 --> 00:38:29.670
So she didn't-- either
she didn't get around

00:38:29.670 --> 00:38:33.360
to finalizing, or because she
wasn't planning to publish it

00:38:33.360 --> 00:38:37.450
she didn't want to finalize,
or as I choose to think of it,

00:38:37.450 --> 00:38:41.460
she just was really making great
use of that utterly free space

00:38:41.460 --> 00:38:45.170
of the poem that I talked about.

00:38:45.170 --> 00:38:47.610
And you'll see that
I too incorporate

00:38:47.610 --> 00:38:52.920
multiple possibilities
for words in my poem.

00:38:52.920 --> 00:38:55.530
It also has a quote
from Emily Dickinson,

00:38:55.530 --> 00:38:59.100
which is something she
wrote in one of her letters.

00:38:59.100 --> 00:39:03.780
"All men say what to me,"
meaning that she'd often

00:39:03.780 --> 00:39:09.360
say something to a man and get
a response, what, like no one

00:39:09.360 --> 00:39:12.540
understood her because
she was too brilliant.

00:39:12.540 --> 00:39:16.620
And then there's a tad bit of
French in the first stanza,

00:39:16.620 --> 00:39:20.180
so "un Francais" is a Frenchman.

00:39:20.180 --> 00:39:24.190
And in the poem,
this Frenchman says,

00:39:24.190 --> 00:39:27.740
"c'est chaud, hein," which
just means, "it's hot, right?"

00:39:27.740 --> 00:39:30.965
"It's hot, isn't it?

00:39:30.965 --> 00:39:38.450
So, "To the Poet Who After
My Reading Said, 'Your Poems

00:39:38.450 --> 00:39:39.350
are Good.

00:39:39.350 --> 00:39:43.200
Eccentric, But Good.'"

00:39:43.200 --> 00:39:48.090
Imagine that you at 18, in Paris
for the first time with all

00:39:48.090 --> 00:39:53.400
your loving ideals about penises
intact, in your new mini trench

00:39:53.400 --> 00:39:57.300
coat and smelling the smell
of garlic and unfiltered smoke

00:39:57.300 --> 00:40:01.690
and assaultive coffee, were
approached from behind.

00:40:01.690 --> 00:40:05.890
Imagine un Francais,
bald, smooth, spectacled,

00:40:05.890 --> 00:40:10.170
grabbed your right hand and
pressed it to his yes soft yes

00:40:10.170 --> 00:40:14.490
exposed penis, and hissed,
'c'est chaud, hein?'

00:40:14.490 --> 00:40:16.740
as he kept walking
past you shaking

00:40:16.740 --> 00:40:19.770
with his poor French
demented laughs.

00:40:19.770 --> 00:40:21.270
Would you say trauma?

00:40:21.270 --> 00:40:22.410
It wasn't.

00:40:22.410 --> 00:40:24.060
Would you think poem fodder?

00:40:24.060 --> 00:40:26.670
Would you bring to bear
your rhetoric textbook

00:40:26.670 --> 00:40:30.450
and wall of metaphors
built up from yes stone

00:40:30.450 --> 00:40:34.080
yes sky yes Shakespeare?

00:40:34.080 --> 00:40:38.250
You no not arrogant mentioned
your encroaching baldness,

00:40:38.250 --> 00:40:41.400
which I said that I yes liked.

00:40:41.400 --> 00:40:44.880
You were not spectacled nor
smooth, but admire, I think,

00:40:44.880 --> 00:40:46.350
smoothness.

00:40:46.350 --> 00:40:47.940
You didn't want to say bad.

00:40:47.940 --> 00:40:50.190
You couldn't commit to good.

00:40:50.190 --> 00:40:52.410
Smoothly, the
current does not run.

00:40:52.410 --> 00:40:55.200
Smoothness can never shock.

00:40:55.200 --> 00:40:57.600
When electricity
veins through the sky,

00:40:57.600 --> 00:41:01.950
is that really its best,
it's crispest manifestation?

00:41:01.950 --> 00:41:06.700
Must Emily Dickinson ride
through the yes cloud-dark sky

00:41:06.700 --> 00:41:12.010
on a flashing bolt, screaming
'all men say what to me?'

00:41:12.010 --> 00:41:14.550
Hands tattooed with
the small crosses

00:41:14.550 --> 00:41:19.120
that meant she couldn't choose,
settle on an ideal word.

00:41:19.120 --> 00:41:24.590
Abandoned possibility fairer
than prose for a what, word?

00:41:24.590 --> 00:41:28.880
Imagine this same hot lightning
snaking up your rectum.

00:41:28.880 --> 00:41:32.750
That was childbirth,
14 hours hard work.

00:41:32.750 --> 00:41:34.790
And my husband's
smell and my cow

00:41:34.790 --> 00:41:37.610
moans and the doula's
watered-down grape juice

00:41:37.610 --> 00:41:38.900
helped.

00:41:38.900 --> 00:41:41.120
I couldn't call it pain, no.

00:41:41.120 --> 00:41:42.410
Orgasm, no.

00:41:42.410 --> 00:41:45.110
Earthquake, closer, but no.

00:41:45.110 --> 00:41:48.080
But I wanted so to
call it something.

00:41:48.080 --> 00:41:51.290
This is the merry
disease we share.

00:41:51.290 --> 00:41:53.390
I suspected that
the Queen's English

00:41:53.390 --> 00:41:58.940
and I would not run smoothly
then, so I wept past imagining.

00:41:58.940 --> 00:42:03.080
Is it possible that death
will be a yes, immortality not

00:42:03.080 --> 00:42:06.290
a marble stone but
a what, maxipad?

00:42:06.290 --> 00:42:08.180
A silver perfume?

00:42:08.180 --> 00:42:14.790
There is no yes true metaphor,
each eccentric as the others.

00:42:14.790 --> 00:42:18.320
When I dab my wrist and neck
with the oily rollerball

00:42:18.320 --> 00:42:22.850
of my favorite perfume
essence, Rain by Terranova,

00:42:22.850 --> 00:42:26.830
a bargain at yes less
than $20 for 0.3 ounces,

00:42:26.830 --> 00:42:30.210
notes of lily of the
valley, clover, and musk,

00:42:30.210 --> 00:42:35.220
I do it because it smells
fresh, like a new earth.

00:42:35.220 --> 00:42:37.950
Imagine that same
lightning struck you down

00:42:37.950 --> 00:42:40.080
on the new earth dead.

00:42:40.080 --> 00:42:41.970
You'd say critical judgment.

00:42:41.970 --> 00:42:44.850
I'd say poor social skills.

00:42:44.850 --> 00:42:48.360
Imagine instead the lightning
struck the earth and a laurel

00:42:48.360 --> 00:42:51.930
bloomed where once
stood only tombstones.

00:42:51.930 --> 00:42:54.780
I know it's hard to
be a man with an ideal

00:42:54.780 --> 00:42:57.900
between your legs, and
nothing but Shakespeare's

00:42:57.900 --> 00:43:02.310
cold lightning waiting
for you on Judgment Day.

00:43:02.310 --> 00:43:04.440
Let's wait together.

00:43:04.440 --> 00:43:07.970
We open our hearts
and dictionaries.

00:43:07.970 --> 00:43:12.980
You were waiting, weren't you,
for me to say, gee, thanks,

00:43:12.980 --> 00:43:18.250
and are still what
yes no waiting?"

00:43:18.250 --> 00:43:20.019
So thank you.

00:43:20.019 --> 00:43:22.434
[APPLAUSE]

00:43:27.161 --> 00:43:27.660
Thank you.

00:43:27.660 --> 00:43:29.400
So this is the last poem.

00:43:29.400 --> 00:43:33.090
And it's an example, I think,
of a poem that song-like.

00:43:33.090 --> 00:43:38.640
I've always been obsessed with
the idea of radical inclusion,

00:43:38.640 --> 00:43:43.360
the idea of making a poem that
I could put everything in.

00:43:43.360 --> 00:43:46.410
So that's impossible,
but I do keep trying.

00:43:46.410 --> 00:43:49.810
And this is a poem where
I was trying to do that.

00:43:49.810 --> 00:43:53.970
And it's just called "Go,"
so I send you forth with it.

00:43:57.530 --> 00:43:58.550
"It is a cube.

00:43:58.550 --> 00:43:59.360
It is red.

00:43:59.360 --> 00:44:00.560
It is mountainous.

00:44:00.560 --> 00:44:01.850
It is a bird of fire.

00:44:01.850 --> 00:44:03.530
It is the bones of the pelvis.

00:44:03.530 --> 00:44:04.640
It is a walnut.

00:44:04.640 --> 00:44:06.290
It is treasured.

00:44:06.290 --> 00:44:09.620
It is yellow Saturn,
wobbling in its orbit.

00:44:09.620 --> 00:44:12.590
It is danger squawking.

00:44:12.590 --> 00:44:16.190
It is the desire to sit down
with strangers in cafes,

00:44:16.190 --> 00:44:19.130
and then it is the
strangers in cafes.

00:44:19.130 --> 00:44:21.680
It is the man with the
black t-shirt labeled

00:44:21.680 --> 00:44:25.130
'unarmed civilian,' and it is
the blind man with him and his

00:44:25.130 --> 00:44:27.550
painful trembling.

00:44:27.550 --> 00:44:32.380
Always it is oxygen and more
oxygen. It is the fight in you

00:44:32.380 --> 00:44:34.810
and the fight in you dying.

00:44:34.810 --> 00:44:40.020
It is the need for water and the
water that falls from the sky.

00:44:40.020 --> 00:44:42.110
It is desperate
for a theory and it

00:44:42.110 --> 00:44:45.110
is the acts you call
evil when you know there

00:44:45.110 --> 00:44:48.050
is no evil, only desperation.

00:44:48.050 --> 00:44:51.970
It is that bravery, that
arrogance, that blindness.

00:44:51.970 --> 00:44:57.510
It is the pink morning and
your smile in the pink morning.

00:44:57.510 --> 00:45:00.120
It is a phantom and a
thin neck of a tree.

00:45:00.120 --> 00:45:03.420
It is a little project
called loving the world.

00:45:03.420 --> 00:45:04.890
It is howling in the dirt.

00:45:04.890 --> 00:45:07.200
It is an extravaganza.

00:45:07.200 --> 00:45:12.550
It's the abandoned sports bra
in the dirt beside howling you.

00:45:12.550 --> 00:45:15.080
It's the wind chimes
in the thin-neck tree

00:45:15.080 --> 00:45:16.880
and it is tongue-tied.

00:45:16.880 --> 00:45:18.230
It is asleep.

00:45:18.230 --> 00:45:19.910
It is waking up now.

00:45:19.910 --> 00:45:22.190
It is a small cat on the bed.

00:45:22.190 --> 00:45:24.170
It is the threads
of the leaf and it

00:45:24.170 --> 00:45:28.490
is the three graces, splendor,
mirth, and good cheer.

00:45:28.490 --> 00:45:30.740
It is their heartfelt advice.

00:45:30.740 --> 00:45:32.760
You can't let it hurt you.

00:45:32.760 --> 00:45:35.120
You're must let it hurt you.

00:45:35.120 --> 00:45:39.610
It is a careless error and the
hotel pool blue with chemistry.

00:45:39.610 --> 00:45:40.550
It's a kiss.

00:45:40.550 --> 00:45:42.620
Of course it is a kiss.

00:45:42.620 --> 00:45:46.970
It's an old strange book, newly
acquired but not yet cataloged.

00:45:46.970 --> 00:45:49.460
It is crazy.

00:45:49.460 --> 00:45:53.630
It is you crazy with honesty
and crazy with ambition.

00:45:53.630 --> 00:45:57.560
It's the sun that stuns
over and over again.

00:45:57.560 --> 00:46:01.250
It's your tablet, which is
every tablet everywhere.

00:46:01.250 --> 00:46:02.240
It's an explosion.

00:46:02.240 --> 00:46:05.490
It is every
explosion everywhere.

00:46:05.490 --> 00:46:09.420
It is pavement, mineral and
hot, and wet with droplets.

00:46:09.420 --> 00:46:13.320
It's the stars that pitch
white needles into the pond.

00:46:13.320 --> 00:46:14.290
It is provable.

00:46:14.290 --> 00:46:15.270
It is a lotion.

00:46:15.270 --> 00:46:16.990
It is a lie.

00:46:16.990 --> 00:46:20.960
It is a baby, because
everyone is a baby.

00:46:20.960 --> 00:46:23.390
It talks to you, always to you.

00:46:23.390 --> 00:46:24.680
It moves swiftly.

00:46:24.680 --> 00:46:25.430
It is stuck.

00:46:25.430 --> 00:46:26.600
It moves swiftly.

00:46:26.600 --> 00:46:27.410
It is stuck.

00:46:27.410 --> 00:46:29.390
It moves swiftly.

00:46:29.390 --> 00:46:33.040
It's the impenetrable
truth, now clear as ice.

00:46:33.040 --> 00:46:34.170
It is serious.

00:46:34.170 --> 00:46:35.360
It is irreversible.

00:46:35.360 --> 00:46:37.940
It is going, going.

00:46:37.940 --> 00:46:40.580
It is flying now,
laughing, strong enough

00:46:40.580 --> 00:46:42.960
to know anything."

00:46:42.960 --> 00:46:43.980
Thank you very much.

00:46:43.980 --> 00:46:45.780
[APPLAUSE]

00:46:45.780 --> 00:46:48.830
