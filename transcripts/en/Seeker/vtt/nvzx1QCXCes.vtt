00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:02.800
Canada's Syncrude Tailings is the largest.

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:05.250
Tajikistan Nurek is the tallest.

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:07.680
Brazil's Itaipu is the most powerful.

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:19.520
Damn dams are everywhere and they're getting
bigger all the time dammit!

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:23.710
Hydropower is one of the oldest methods of
power generation in the world.

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:30.050
Today, we often think of Hoover dam, but ancient
Greeks used the power of turning waterwheels

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:31.520
to grind grain.

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:35.620
That power was harnessed even in the early
Americas when colonists built mills on creeks

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:37.910
with enough drop to run waterwheels.

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:42.320
Today, instead of a waterwheel on a creek,
hydropower often involves building a massive

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.310
dam to hold back a water source.

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:49.829
With enough water pressure and drop, the water
can turn giant turbines and generate electricity.The

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.579
Department of Energy says "70 percent of Washington
State’s electricity comes from hydropower…

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:59.130
and 11 states get more than 10 percent of
their electricity from hydro."

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:04.960
The thing is, only 3 percent of the 80,000
dams in the U.S. generate electricity, and

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:11.790
even if they do, dams inevitably alter thousands
of square miles of waterways in both directions,

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.640
affecting fish and wildlife, forests, farms,
and (of course) human populations.

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:21.610
China is the largest producer of hydroelectricity,
followed by Canada, Brazil, and the United

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:24.369
States, according to the Energy Information
Administration.

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:29.580
The Xayaburi dam is a three-and-a-half billion
dollar project on the Mekong river in northern

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:32.880
Laos scheduled to be completed in 2019.

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.240
It's one of 11 dams planned to be completed
by 2025.

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:43.060
Though they'll provide 8 percent of the region's
electricity, and 3.7 billion a year in income;

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:47.890
it will affect more than 200-thousand people
in the region and result in "possible extinction

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:53.020
of fish species, reduced fish populations,
inundation of river bank gardens, and loss

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:59.780
of nutrients for floodplain agriculture equivalent
to 500 million dollars a year," according

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.330
to a 2011 International Rivers report.

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:06.610
Plus, construction of the dams could expedite
the extinction of these cute but weird-looking

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:08.160
Irrawaddy dolphins.

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.220
Most people are aware of the impediments these
dams make for spawning and migrating fish,

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:13.690
but it's not just that...

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:17.870
Water in a reservoir is stagnant, gathering
more sediment and growing more aquatic weeds

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:22.440
and algae -- causing problems with downstream
life.

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.340
Fish are used to certain temperatures and
levels of oxygen in their river water.

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:32.470
Dams not only block the fish, but the deep
reservoirs held by the dam result in damn

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:35.200
cold water with VERY little oxygen.

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:41.239
Opening the reservoir to respond to a sudden
demand for electricity causes this cold, barely

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:46.970
oxygenated water to rush into rivers, suffocating
and killing fish, this is according to the

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:49.190
Union of Concerned Scientists.

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:53.760
On top of all that, the river itself suffers,
because sand, rocks, wood and other natural

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:58.450
sediment builds up in the reservoir rather
than spreading downriver.

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:03.430
On top of ALL THAT, The Union of Concerned
Scientists found large hydroelectric dams

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:08.590
DO pollute with greenhouses gases.

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:15.849
As the reservoir behind the dam grows or floods
over plants; that material decomposes releasing

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:19.420
CO2 and methane; especially in tropical areas.

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:24.660
Emissions vary, but are just underneath the
lowest levels from a natural gas plant.

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:29.470
The Balbina hydroelectric dam in Brazil flooded
over 900 square miles (2360 sq km) of land

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:35.240
-- an area the size of Delaware, that's a
lot of decomposing vegetation.

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:39.950
Dams are considered symbols of human achievement
and national willpower, but that can come

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:45.480
at the expense of our national resources and
still cause pollution and destruction.

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:51.599
We didn't even talk about earthquakes or the
construction of the dams themselves -- which

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:53.400
can take as long as a decade.

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.380
So what can we do?

00:03:55.380 --> 00:04:00.340
Two, century-old, dams on the Elwha River
in Washington state are blocking a key salmon

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:06.659
spawning channel -- and they generate very
little electricity -- so they're being demolished!

00:04:06.659 --> 00:04:10.980
Aside from tearing them down, some hydropower
plants simply divert water rather than daming

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:18.519
a whole river, and you can even generate power
using natural wave surge in the ocean!

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:22.259
Another way companies are using nature to
power our appliances is with wind energy,

00:04:22.259 --> 00:04:25.710
but what about when the wind's not blowing?

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:28.930
Then you just capture the wind in a cave and
use it later!

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:31.050
It sounds like a cartoon, but it's REAL.

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:49.780
Check out this REALLY OLD DNews video about
it here And if you love DNews, you really

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:54.599
should click that subscribe button, that's
how we know you're coming back to watch more.

00:04:54.599 --> 00:04:55.599
Go ahead and do it dammit!

00:04:55.599 --> 00:04:56.599
No, i mean, don't dam it.

00:04:56.599 --> 00:04:57.599
But click the button.
