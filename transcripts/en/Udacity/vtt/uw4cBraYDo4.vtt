00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Buon giorno! We're here in Pisa, Italy, where Galileo Galilei is rumored to have completed

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
some of this famous experiments on motion

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
including dropping objects from the leaning tower.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
In this unit, we're going to complete some of those experiments ourselves,

00:00:15.000 --> 99:59:59.000
and we're going to derive the laws of motion that Galileo Galilei figured out in the 16th century.
