1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:02,280
Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich.

2
00:00:02,390 --> 00:00:06,330
This is radio lab and today my name is
Alisa Faith Pennington and I am a u s

3
00:00:06,331 --> 00:00:07,890
citizen by birth. We're going to start,

4
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:10,520
I was homeschooled my entire
life with a cry for help.

5
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:15,410
I have no 19 years old and I'm unable
to get a driver's license, get a job,

6
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:18,800
go to college, get on a plane,
get a bank account for vote.

7
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:22,070
This is the story of a woman
who became sort of famous.

8
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:27,130
I didn't pick the situation for
myself and I don't know how to fix it.

9
00:00:27,261 --> 00:00:31,400
I don't know how to get this
through being invisible.

10
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:34,220
So

11
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:36,110
for having no identity whatsoever,

12
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:38,840
if you've been through a similar
situation or know anyone who can help,

13
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:42,260
please contact me. The story
comes to us from our reporter,

14
00:00:42,261 --> 00:00:46,280
Alexandra young and the young
woman at the center of this story.

15
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,000
Um, I was born in Texas is Elisia faith.

16
00:00:50,001 --> 00:00:53,600
Pennington goes by faith
in, born in Houston.

17
00:00:53,601 --> 00:00:56,030
And then we moved to Kerrville.
Uh, when I was real little,

18
00:00:56,031 --> 00:00:59,420
like I don't even remember Houston at
all. She grew up in a really small town.

19
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:02,840
About 45 minutes outside of San
Antonio and it's kind of country.

20
00:01:02,841 --> 00:01:04,790
We lived right outside
of Kerrville actually.

21
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:09,290
So it was even more in the
country than Kerrville. His face.

22
00:01:09,291 --> 00:01:11,930
Parents were very
conservative, very religious,

23
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:17,350
and they had created a place for their
family that was separate from the rest of

24
00:01:18,021 --> 00:01:18,854
the world.

25
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:22,010
Well, hi there. Welcome
to the Pennington point.

26
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:26,660
I'm Lisa and I just wanted to
say a quick hello face mom.

27
00:01:26,661 --> 00:01:30,920
Lisa actually kept a video blog
of life in the Pennington family.

28
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:32,180
Right now the sun is shining,

29
00:01:32,181 --> 00:01:35,330
the birds are singing so
peaceful out here in the country.

30
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:39,350
So we had like maybe like five acres
of land. This is our front porch.

31
00:01:39,351 --> 00:01:42,440
We bought this old farm house
about 10 years ago and started

32
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:46,840
and we had a little home
farm. We had goats, chickens.

33
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:51,670
We had um, rabbits at one point,
a cow that we would like raise,

34
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:52,150
you know,

35
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:55,090
we'd butcher it and then freeze like all
the meat and then eat it over the year.

36
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:59,500
So it was this sort of approaching
self-sufficiency or was it, was it,

37
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:03,550
I think what my parents wanted to do
is kind of reach that self-sufficient

38
00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:06,090
point. Um, but they also really
wanted to give their something,

39
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:07,230
their kids to teach them

40
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:11,360
responsibility every day before he
could go play. You had to do a chore.

41
00:02:11,361 --> 00:02:12,194
There was a chore.

42
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:17,180
We had a chart and it would have the
kids names down one. How many of those,

43
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:21,230
how many of you were there? But
nine children, grace, Jacob hope,

44
00:02:21,231 --> 00:02:25,090
faith patients don't. Adam a legend,
Levi. Um, you've got that down pat

45
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:32,390
picking loader forth right in the
middle, Middle Child Syndrome.

46
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:36,560
And her parents says
faith. They were kind,

47
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:41,600
but I'm very firm, very strict.

48
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:44,630
A lot of rules for how you're supposed
to dress and how you're supposed to look

49
00:02:44,631 --> 00:02:47,840
and how you supposed to carry yourself.
What were some of those rules? Uh,

50
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:49,230
for the girls? Um,

51
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:53,000
you had to wear dresses and little super
high callers and we always had to wear

52
00:02:53,001 --> 00:02:57,980
sleeves. No sleeveless, kinda Amish
but not like that conservative. And uh,

53
00:02:58,190 --> 00:02:59,890
we all had really, really long hair.

54
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:03,220
We didn't cut our hair and we just didn't
have a lot of access to things that

55
00:03:03,221 --> 00:03:06,040
they didn't want us to have access to.
Like we didn't have internet until like,

56
00:03:06,041 --> 00:03:09,310
you were like 18 and could get on the
allowed on the Internet for like limited

57
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:13,180
sites and stuff. What about
television? Did you guys have that? No.

58
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:18,220
None of kids watch television today.
Um, love electronics then they don't,

59
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:23,340
they tend to not have as much of a
passion for learning and working and um,

60
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,790
their bottle reading and they didn't
get to watch a lot of movies growing up.

61
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:30,790
They only listen to Christian music.
Were you homeschooled or were you,

62
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:33,070
did you go to public school
or what? How did that work?

63
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:36,550
All homeschool DePaul school. Every
single one. What does that mean?

64
00:03:36,551 --> 00:03:39,340
That you were like, I'm always on the,

65
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:44,790
on the property or we need a go to
church off and on various times.

66
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:49,060
So we'd go off for that because stuff
but just sort of super rarely like we

67
00:03:49,061 --> 00:03:53,020
didn't most of the time Trisha,
mostly you are with your family.

68
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:58,440
Then I was just having a kind of a moral
thing like like we are trying to keep

69
00:03:59,681 --> 00:04:04,681
you a wholly and I think they just
wanted to keep like the things that they

70
00:04:07,691 --> 00:04:11,860
thought were like sinful in the world
away from their kids and try to like keep

71
00:04:11,861 --> 00:04:15,430
them safe and everything. But they
stopped that. So if you said I want yes,

72
00:04:15,431 --> 00:04:19,630
they would say no and they when they
say nope. Yeah, arguing was not allowed.

73
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:24,250
But faith actually she was always just
kind of pushing that line just the little

74
00:04:24,251 --> 00:04:29,140
bit. I am definitely a lot more stubborn
and a lot more free spirited and right

75
00:04:29,141 --> 00:04:32,470
around her 18th birthday
I just, I don't know,

76
00:04:32,471 --> 00:04:34,120
I reached a point like a breaking point.

77
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:35,860
Mm.

78
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:36,020
Was,

79
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:38,830
we were actually having like a little
family meeting and I was with the four

80
00:04:38,831 --> 00:04:41,500
oldest siblings and my parents were
kind of supposed to discuss things.

81
00:04:41,501 --> 00:04:44,260
And then my oldest sister
asked was asking my mom,

82
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:48,580
she was considering getting a job and
kind of asking advice or permission if she

83
00:04:48,581 --> 00:04:52,270
could. And they're like, nope, that
brings in too much outside influence.

84
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:54,530
But she was 23 yeah. Hmm.

85
00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:58,180
And then my brother said he wanted more
internet because he was doing work for

86
00:04:58,181 --> 00:05:00,850
our church and they're like, I'm
sorry we can't do that. You know,

87
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:02,860
you could be looking at
things online, you know,

88
00:05:02,861 --> 00:05:06,040
we just have to shut it off then
hope the one that's right next to me,

89
00:05:06,041 --> 00:05:09,730
she was 21 she was asking for a
phone. My own parents were like, no,

90
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:13,360
you don't have to have a phone. And
so I was just like, wow. You know,

91
00:05:13,361 --> 00:05:14,340
I'm looking at my other siblings

92
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:17,730
and they have nothing ahead of
them. We're not allowed to get jobs,

93
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:18,840
not allowed to go to school.

94
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:22,920
They have no life except living here on
this little farm. They have no future.

95
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:26,850
After that night, I decided I
couldn't live like that. I couldn't,

96
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:28,710
I was not going to turn out like that.

97
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:34,010
So I had an iPod and I went down
to my parent's room and I snuck,

98
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:34,680
um,

99
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:37,920
when my mom wasn't there and I snuck my
grandpa's phone number and since he had

100
00:05:37,921 --> 00:05:41,700
an iPhone, I could text him over Wifi
from my iPod. So I did. And I said, hey,

101
00:05:41,701 --> 00:05:44,610
when y'all come visit next weekend,
I want to go back with you.

102
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,390
I need help. Like I need
to go away from here.

103
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:52,530
Can you take me back home with
you? And um, he said he would.

104
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:57,880
So grandpa is not of the
same mind as your folks? Oh,

105
00:05:57,890 --> 00:05:58,490
well

106
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:01,100
they weren't really on board
with how my parents did things,

107
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:05,780
but they always kept coming to see us and
so I knew that they cared about me and

108
00:06:05,781 --> 00:06:08,360
so I felt safe to reach out to them.

109
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:14,050
So the next week her grandpa and her
grandma show up at the farm and um,

110
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:14,410
Yep.

111
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:16,000
Plan was to just, you know, just

112
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:20,020
what were you going to bolt or
how are you going to do this?

113
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:25,340
I went into bold. Yeah, no, but I just
wanted to go, but my grandpa was like,

114
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:28,490
you need to ask them first. You
need to ask permission. So I did.

115
00:06:28,491 --> 00:06:33,260
And then they said, no, you can't go
with them. And then so I was like,

116
00:06:33,261 --> 00:06:37,970
okay, cause I couldn't
argue. And then I said,

117
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,720
uh, or they approached my
grandparents approached me back,

118
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:44,810
so do you still want to go or,
and I finally decided that I did.

119
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:45,991
As far as you know,

120
00:06:45,991 --> 00:06:50,991
you're the only one so far in the family
history that might dare to act on this,

121
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:52,643
these convictions.

122
00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:57,690
Uh, no one had ever done anything
like that in our family before.

123
00:06:58,170 --> 00:06:59,003
So

124
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:03,730
the next morning, September 24th,

125
00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:07,840
2014 my mom was on her morning
run and my dad was in his office.

126
00:07:07,841 --> 00:07:09,190
He said he was always there
working in the morning,

127
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:12,520
so none of them were in the house and my
grandparents had goodbye to the rest of

128
00:07:12,521 --> 00:07:14,680
the kids. Then I just walked
out the door with them.

129
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:19,660
With luggage or just one suitcase? Yeah,

130
00:07:20,530 --> 00:07:23,710
my, my grandpa texted my mom and was
like, we're taking faith with us.

131
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:26,620
Just wanted you to know. And
then my mom texted him and said,

132
00:07:26,621 --> 00:07:28,450
don't go anywhere yet. I'm coming back.

133
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:35,000
She had texted my dad and then
they, they both came and, uh,

134
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:37,420
tried to get me to get out
of the car. They were like,

135
00:07:37,421 --> 00:07:39,550
you have to get out of the car. I was
like, I don't have to like, well, yeah,

136
00:07:39,551 --> 00:07:42,340
you have to because we're telling
you to. I'm like, well, no.

137
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:46,780
So they got in and they actually
asked my grandparents to get out.

138
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:48,011
They were like,

139
00:07:48,011 --> 00:07:50,080
can you get out of the car and
we'll get in so we can talk to her.

140
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:53,230
So you were alone in the car with your
parents then? That's when all the,

141
00:07:53,231 --> 00:07:55,000
all the safety goes away right here.

142
00:07:55,001 --> 00:07:59,470
That's the only thing I had on my side
is that I was buckled in the car and

143
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:03,640
refused to get out. I think
they were just kind of shocked.

144
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:09,100
I was so torn. I mean, they
felt like I was just melting.

145
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:13,870
And what was it that
kept you in the seat? Um,

146
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:17,380
I think it was just telling myself over
and over that I knew it was the right

147
00:08:17,381 --> 00:08:19,600
thing to do, even though
it doesn't feel like it.

148
00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:24,810
I had to take control of my
life and after awhile they,

149
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:29,140
my grandparents were like, we have
to go, like we need to leave now.

150
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:34,030
And so they left just drove away.

151
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:35,230
[inaudible]

152
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:39,700
so these were like, this is, this is what,
eight people that you eight plus two,

153
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:42,220
so this is 10 people that you are,

154
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:47,900
yeah, they're my entire world. Like yeah,

155
00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:52,310
I was astonished that she had the
boldness to carry out that plan.

156
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:55,010
This is Jenny Elena's
face and her mother's,

157
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:59,370
who like her grandparents didn't really
subscribe to the Pennington Worldview,

158
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:03,090
but she would visit them from time to
time at the farm. You know, for faith,

159
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,240
it's even more than just the
boldness of leaving her family.

160
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:09,990
She believed she was walking
into this world that was bad,

161
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:12,360
that was potentially going to harm her.

162
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:14,390
[inaudible]

163
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:18,170
so that first night she gets to my
parents' house, my grandparents said, hey,

164
00:09:18,171 --> 00:09:21,590
you can sleep in this room and
there's a TV in the guest room.

165
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:24,740
And they just toss a remote
and leave her alone and said,

166
00:09:24,741 --> 00:09:26,630
we want whatever you want. Now faith,

167
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:30,490
she had never been allowed to pick
her own TV shows. No. And so she,

168
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:32,920
she turns it on

169
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:38,130
for a place that gets full sun and she
said it was like a eight to 10 hours of

170
00:09:38,131 --> 00:09:41,910
sunlight a day gardening show or a
home improvement show or something.

171
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:46,200
And she's sitting there thinking, I
don't know if this is bad for me exactly.

172
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:49,020
Just pour a little water on
top and if it drains away,

173
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:52,210
should I be watching this? Cause that's
kind of what my parents did there.

174
00:09:52,211 --> 00:09:54,280
They would kind of dictate what
was right, was wrong. You know,

175
00:09:54,281 --> 00:09:56,170
when someone would do something, but
okay, that's wrong. We're like, okay,

176
00:09:56,171 --> 00:09:59,350
that's right. And now that
moral compass was gone,

177
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:04,530
she suddenly wasn't sure what was
good and what was bad anymore. Yeah.

178
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,560
I am so tired of the way
we relate to one another.

179
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:10,560
And 19 is a tough place
to step into the world.

180
00:10:10,561 --> 00:10:14,960
Being that naive to have sex
with his wife, I don't care.

181
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:18,570
You know, she was asking me about sex,
like how do you learn? What do you,

182
00:10:18,571 --> 00:10:21,720
I don't know anything. I thought
I knew what kind of manual.

183
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:25,470
I didn't know anything. Even
the most basic social norms,

184
00:10:25,471 --> 00:10:28,890
like I don't know how I'm supposed to act
when she'd hang out with her cousin or

185
00:10:28,891 --> 00:10:31,410
other people her own age. I don't
know what I'm supposed to talk about.

186
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:35,370
I didn't catch mostly like the references
I'd make all these other teenagers

187
00:10:35,371 --> 00:10:39,900
would be talking about shows, boys
music, movies, school in faith.

188
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,100
I had no idea

189
00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:45,590
she wanted to join this
world. We all live in.

190
00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:50,540
I mean even in the most simple ways. She
wanted to get a job and learn to drive,

191
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:53,840
have an apartment, but she couldn't,

192
00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:56,720
she didn't have course have
a driver's license. Nope.

193
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:58,880
Plus she didn't have a
social security number.

194
00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:02,240
Didn't have the birth certificate?
No. Where you were born. We did.

195
00:11:02,241 --> 00:11:03,980
When you were born, didn't they say, okay,

196
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:06,230
this is the hospital will
wasn't at a hospital.

197
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:10,220
It was all home birth plus
they specifically sought
out midwives that would

198
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:14,270
agree to file no records. Why
would you want to do that? Um,

199
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:18,500
there's this whole kind of way of
thinking. It's called, what's it called,

200
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:22,760
sovereignty to take some of
these documents as they exist,

201
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:25,610
they've got hooks in them.
So as I dug into this story,

202
00:11:25,611 --> 00:11:28,220
I actually talked to a bunch of people who

203
00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:31,580
the birth certificate seemed
like a paper of ownership

204
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:35,400
for political or religious
or just privacy reasons,

205
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:38,360
don't want this kind of documentation
from the government. Yeah,

206
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:41,370
definitely been used for
a measure of control.

207
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:46,030
Now faced parents who actually
wouldn't talk to me for this story,

208
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:47,650
they're not specifically
a part of that movement,

209
00:11:47,651 --> 00:11:52,651
but my dad kind of adopted some of those
ideas that the government should not a

210
00:11:53,291 --> 00:11:54,124
number assigned to us.

211
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:59,380
They purposefully raised faith and her
eight siblings to be outside of this

212
00:11:59,381 --> 00:12:03,670
system and that's probably
something they thought of as a gift.

213
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:08,080
I guess the thinking is that faith
would be free from the rules of society.

214
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:09,100
Clearly my parents

215
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:12,910
did what they did out of like the best
that they thought they could do. So,

216
00:12:12,911 --> 00:12:16,150
I mean I'm not going to get mad at anybody
for doing what they think they should

217
00:12:16,151 --> 00:12:19,750
do. But to faith it
didn't feel like freedom.

218
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:24,640
It actually felt like prison. And this
is where faith journey really began.

219
00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:28,540
Faith and her aunt and her
grandma, they went online,

220
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:33,040
started poking around and they realize
that the first thing you need is a birth

221
00:12:33,041 --> 00:12:36,190
certificate. Yes, you're starting at
the beginning said, let's get you born.

222
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:39,760
Right. So she applied to the
bureau of vital statistics,

223
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:44,530
government office where they keep track
of like births, deaths, marriages,

224
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:47,410
adoptions, and the bureau of
vital statistics does a search,

225
00:12:47,411 --> 00:12:50,980
not only of that name,
but of any like Jane Doe,

226
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:52,510
babies born in that area.

227
00:12:52,511 --> 00:12:55,450
You know what to make sure that you
weren't stolen at birth from some other

228
00:12:55,930 --> 00:12:58,060
parent or something like that.
But they couldn't find anything.

229
00:12:58,090 --> 00:13:01,060
So they said the next
step is to go to court.

230
00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:06,570
So my mom contacts the court and they
wanted three pieces of information proving

231
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:12,190
her birth facts. Well, there was
a sworn affidavit by my mother,

232
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:15,250
a swearing that, you know, she was
at her birth. So we got that one.

233
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:20,080
So they needed two more documents.
She could get a doctor's records,

234
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:21,670
but she doesn't have any,

235
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:25,420
I've never been at the hospital face
says she's never been that sick.

236
00:13:25,421 --> 00:13:27,560
Never even had an accident
and never been to the dentist.

237
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:30,310
And you're flipping through
the no school records?

238
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:35,170
I had never even set foot inside of
school. Oh Wow. Any savings account?

239
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:39,580
No. You can't get a bank account without
a social. What about immunizations?

240
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:41,860
My Dad was super against all that.

241
00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:45,550
One of the court clerks asked if she
had ever been baptized because the

242
00:13:45,551 --> 00:13:49,540
certificate that you get when you're
baptized in a lot of churches can work as

243
00:13:49,541 --> 00:13:51,400
one of the three pieces of evidence.

244
00:13:52,930 --> 00:13:57,130
But it turns out the baptismal record
didn't have her birthday on it,

245
00:13:57,131 --> 00:13:58,570
so it didn't count.

246
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:02,740
Did you ever go to the library
and get a library card? Nope.

247
00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:04,750
You can't get a library
card without an ID.

248
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:09,760
Did you ever get any mail addressed to
your name at your parents' house? Yes,

249
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:12,430
but it was all, you know, handwritten
stuff, which doesn't count.

250
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:16,960
So you have to go to the judge and say,
what? What do you say to the judge?

251
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:18,730
Well, the judge won't
listen. He just said,

252
00:14:18,731 --> 00:14:21,760
we're not going to hear the case because
you don't have enough to even for me to

253
00:14:21,761 --> 00:14:23,980
even consider because you have
to have some kind of records.

254
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:25,030
You don't have enough proof.

255
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:27,760
So you're sitting there at a table and
there's a lawyer sitting there opposite

256
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:31,070
and you, and you think so.
So I know I was born. Uh,

257
00:14:31,090 --> 00:14:33,040
I believe that I am this age.

258
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:38,290
I was born in my house at
such and such an address.

259
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:41,800
Now what do we do? He looks at you and
says, or she looks at you and says,

260
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:44,290
I've never seen this
before. She seen people,

261
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:45,480
well, undocumented,

262
00:14:45,481 --> 00:14:50,481
but not someone born in this country
invisible to the state and the federal

263
00:14:51,321 --> 00:14:54,200
government we put up, if
you're born in America,

264
00:14:54,201 --> 00:14:57,280
you're not automatically a citizen.
So shouldn't that, I mean that.

265
00:14:57,410 --> 00:15:01,250
It's not like when you're born there's
like this halo floating over your house.

266
00:15:01,251 --> 00:15:05,540
Just letting everyone know you
have to prove it. Yeah. Were they,

267
00:15:05,541 --> 00:15:09,530
couldn't she get a, an immigration
attorney to help? Won't, no, not really.

268
00:15:09,531 --> 00:15:13,040
Because when an immigrant comes
here from another country,

269
00:15:13,041 --> 00:15:18,041
they have this country of origin and
for faith in the eyes of the government,

270
00:15:18,141 --> 00:15:22,880
she has no country of origin. They just
think of her as being from nowhere.

271
00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:26,390
Wow. So I was just like,
I was stuck. That's weird.

272
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:30,320
We called everyone and we could not get
help and we'd get like a little bit of a

273
00:15:30,321 --> 00:15:31,580
lead. Like maybe this will work.

274
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:34,340
And we'd go and we talked to
somebody or we fill out a paper,

275
00:15:34,341 --> 00:15:36,500
we mail something yet or we
call somebody or something.

276
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:40,310
And just like you're rejected every
time, you know, it just looked hopeless.

277
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:43,880
It just made me feel like this is
never going to happen. You know,

278
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:48,550
it got to the point where when she was
at parties or just talking to people

279
00:15:48,551 --> 00:15:49,780
about her situation,

280
00:15:50,030 --> 00:15:52,110
there was like, oh, what are you
doing? I say, oh, I don't exist.

281
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:55,080
And it would kind of start this like
weird conversation and it would actually

282
00:15:55,081 --> 00:15:56,940
start a lot of conversations
for other people.

283
00:15:57,210 --> 00:16:00,300
And it would kind of help
me to like navigate stuff.

284
00:16:00,301 --> 00:16:04,170
And so I actually kind of helped
me figure out how to socialize.

285
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:06,390
It's just this funny
little thing she could say,

286
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:10,410
but when she was alone
it wasn't funny at all.

287
00:16:10,650 --> 00:16:13,260
I went through a really
dark time during that.

288
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:18,120
I went through a lot of depression. And
did your depression manifest in you?

289
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:22,710
What, what happened to you?
Um, I was not self harmful,

290
00:16:22,711 --> 00:16:26,430
but I was having a lot of suicidal
thoughts. I feel me. Doesn't know.

291
00:16:26,431 --> 00:16:27,600
Most of my friends don't even know.

292
00:16:28,050 --> 00:16:33,050
It's just felt like I was just floating
in like in the middle of just see,

293
00:16:33,690 --> 00:16:36,410
have just so much stuff, you
know, I didn't know who I was.

294
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:39,260
I kind of feel like I
didn't really exist at all.

295
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:48,750
[inaudible]

296
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:51,540
we're going to take a quick
break and we'll be right back.

297

anemia last year. His friends, his fans,

I know you're talking about this sunny
day right here that we have it right now.

Hey, I'm Jen. I boom, rod. I'm Robert
Krulwich. This is radio lab and today

312
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:50,460
the story of a woman who famous for being

313
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:52,510
infamously invisible,

314
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:56,990
so she decided that the only solution was,

315
00:17:57,020 --> 00:18:00,470
my name is Alicia Face Pennington
and I'm a u s citizen by birth.

316
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:01,580
To make this video,

317
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:05,810
I was born at home and my
parents neglected to file
birth certificate or birth

318
00:18:05,811 --> 00:18:09,110
record of any kind. She just figured
I was homeschooled my entire life,

319
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:13,040
so I have no school records. Maybe
there's somebody out there that has,

320
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:16,640
you know, done this before, so I was
like, well, let's give it a shot.

321
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:19,430
I want to travel, I want
to get an education.

322
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:22,190
I wanted to just be a
functioning American,

323
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:24,860
but I can't until I can prove citizenship.

324
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:28,280
If you've been through a similar
situation or know anyone who can help,

325
00:18:28,610 --> 00:18:33,380
please contact me. She put it up
on Youtube and then that was it.

326
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:34,670
[inaudible]

327
00:18:34,670 --> 00:18:35,930
I didn't expect anyone to watch it

328
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:38,320
[inaudible]

329
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:39,153
but

330
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:43,430
my phone was just like
notification after notification.

331
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:45,220
It was like dinging and dean and dean.

332
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:48,280
In the first week I had
over 1.3 million views.

333
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:53,770
I hadn't even like been on youtube before
that let alone like posted a video,

334
00:18:53,771 --> 00:18:56,230
so it was crazy. It went up on Reddit,

335
00:18:56,290 --> 00:19:01,060
Twitter and never seeing it on Yahoo in
the front of snapchat daily. Oh my gosh.

336
00:19:01,090 --> 00:19:04,600
People just couldn't believe it. They
were like, can this seriously happen?

337
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:07,810
Gay just took off and then she just
starts getting all these emails.

338
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:11,200
It was insane. I was getting literally
two emails every single second.

339
00:19:11,290 --> 00:19:13,570
That's not an exaggeration and
I couldn't keep up with it.

340
00:19:13,571 --> 00:19:16,860
Like I could not read all of them coming
from like Germany and Israel, Africa,

341
00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:21,160
Australia, India, like it went
worldwide. And what were people saying?

342
00:19:21,161 --> 00:19:23,890
What did they email you
about? Oh, all kinds.

343
00:19:23,891 --> 00:19:26,050
Like I was not only touched
by your screen presence,

344
00:19:26,051 --> 00:19:29,290
but I'm also very infuriated and
frustrated by the circumstances of your

345
00:19:29,291 --> 00:19:29,800
dilemma.

346
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:33,010
I actually sat down with faith while she
read through a bunch of these emails.

347
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:35,560
Hello. I'm very intrigued by your
story, but I'm currently 23 years,

348
00:19:35,561 --> 00:19:38,520
some of them from homeschoolers.
Hello. Elisia my name is Jose.

349
00:19:38,521 --> 00:19:42,130
I'm from the children of immigrants
who felt like a sense of solidarity.

350
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,920
I commend you for reaching out to
the Internet, but a lot of it was,

351
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:47,200
and I pray that you were able to get
the documents you need. Just a lot,

352
00:19:47,201 --> 00:19:49,450
a ton of encouragement saying,
I don't know how to help you,

353
00:19:49,451 --> 00:19:52,030
but I just want you to know I'm
rooting for you. Like don't give up.

354
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:56,020
What did it feel like to
have eyes on you in that way?

355
00:19:56,170 --> 00:19:59,860
It was really empowering.
Um, like I didn't, I didn't,

356
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:03,130
it wasn't very confident in who I was. Um,

357
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:08,080
so just to have so many people
be like, we're behind you. Yeah.

358
00:20:08,170 --> 00:20:11,590
I know. It felt really good
to be recognized a little bit,

359
00:20:11,770 --> 00:20:16,770
but at the same time it kind of made
her more famously that woman who doesn't

360
00:20:18,701 --> 00:20:19,300
exist,

361
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:24,250
the girl with no identity and it didn't
even solve her problem because when

362
00:20:24,251 --> 00:20:28,540
people did offer advice didn't really
help start working on not paying tax.

363
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:30,960
They'll come to you. I got
people who just had, you know,

364
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,150
dumb ideas of what to do.

365
00:20:32,510 --> 00:20:35,440
[inaudible] if I knew you enough to
marry you so you can gain citizenship.

366
00:20:35,441 --> 00:20:39,850
Many of them were marriage proposals.
I got a lot of proposals. Uh,

367
00:20:39,910 --> 00:20:42,450
actually I'll get you pregnant
if that will help. Oh my God,

368
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:45,460
that is some of them not
so subtle. Doesn't want to
just like delete. I'm like,

369
00:20:45,461 --> 00:20:49,570
nope. Nope. And also inside
of those emails and comments,

370
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:53,260
there was a conversation about whether
what her parents did was right.

371
00:20:53,530 --> 00:20:55,930
This one is from like
the opposite perspective.

372
00:20:55,931 --> 00:21:00,220
It says her parents didn't quote neglect
anything. They stood on an exercise,

373
00:21:00,221 --> 00:21:03,520
their rights, and wisely. So what
they did was in her best interest,

374
00:21:03,521 --> 00:21:06,970
she just doesn't understand it because
she is young and she's led a protective

375
00:21:06,971 --> 00:21:07,300
life.

376
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:12,190
A lot of these folks felt like faith was
blowing this gift that her parents had

377
00:21:12,191 --> 00:21:13,024
given her.

378
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:18,980
From my perspective, if you take some
of these documents as they exist,

379
00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:20,090
they've got hooks in them.

380
00:21:20,730 --> 00:21:25,640
This is Alfred addict who blogs about
sovereignty and sovereign citizens.

381
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:28,220
First off, just to give
you a little bit of, uh,

382
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:31,070
evidence that maybe I'm not crazy.

383
00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:36,370
There's a case called Chisholm
versus Georgia from 1793,

384
00:21:36,530 --> 00:21:39,410
and they're talking about
European jurisprudence.

385
00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:42,800
The distinction between
the prince and the subject.

386
00:21:43,610 --> 00:21:46,200
And the distinction is that the
prince gets his rights from God.

387
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:48,860
That's when they say the
king is anointed. The Nice,

388
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:52,670
exactly right in a coronation ceremony.
But they go on and they say, no.

389
00:21:52,671 --> 00:21:56,930
Such ideas obtained here, meaning
within the United States of America,

390
00:21:57,380 --> 00:22:02,060
after the revolution, the
sovereignty devolved on the people,

391
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:05,690
and they are the true sovereigns.

392
00:22:05,870 --> 00:22:08,600
And the word sovereigns is plural. Yeah.

393
00:22:08,630 --> 00:22:10,190
I think we all know
that you're a sovereign.

394
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:12,230
I'm a sour and Alexandra's a sovereign.

395
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:15,080
How do you deal with the opening
phrase then in the constitution,

396
00:22:15,081 --> 00:22:19,280
which is we the girl, we and
people, not I the person one by one,

397
00:22:19,281 --> 00:22:22,730
but we the people want it says we the
people. It means we, the sovereigns.

398
00:22:23,810 --> 00:22:27,650
Sovereigns are not a collective.
Think many people would argue.

399
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:31,810
I understand that. But if you are,
we ended up getting into this,

400
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,210
a little tussle over the rules
of government, not in visibility,

401
00:22:35,850 --> 00:22:40,190
the idea that the constitution, but
eventually we got back to faith.

402
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:45,050
Once you have been recognized as
a sovereign, how do you avoid,

403
00:22:45,170 --> 00:22:48,350
it's like getting rid, I'm doing
well. I'm just gonna. I want to judge.

404
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:51,590
I don't want blue eyes
anymore. But part of you must,

405
00:22:51,591 --> 00:22:54,890
part of you must go out and feel a
little sorry for her. Right? Like she,

406
00:22:54,891 --> 00:22:57,290
she's got, she has a,

407
00:22:57,710 --> 00:23:02,710
she has a will to become something other
than he has a will to become a subject.

408
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,830
A subject. Yes. Yes. So,

409
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:10,040
but I don't think that you
condemning want to be free. Oh,

410
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:13,850
you are condemning her then? A little
bit. No, I'm saying she's making a choice.

411
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,030
There's proviso in the Bible
where people in the Old Testament,

412
00:23:17,031 --> 00:23:18,350
if you wanted to remain, you could,

413
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:20,390
you could volunteer to
be a slave for some guy.

414
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:24,740
Some people don't want to be
sovereigns. It's not an email.

415
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:27,640
I just want a job and they want to
travel and they want to work for a little

416
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:29,270
bit. That's exactly right, but there's,

417
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:33,880
there are consequences for her abandoning
her status as a free woman. Well,

418
00:23:33,890 --> 00:23:37,940
here's the weird irony because she has
no birth certificate because she has no

419
00:23:37,941 --> 00:23:41,390
passport. The state of Texas in the
government or the United States say, well,

420
00:23:41,391 --> 00:23:44,990
we can't figure out how to make you
visible like we, yeah, it's probably,

421
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:46,040
they may

422
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:46,873
not be able to,

423
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:52,010
but then face grandmother lives in
my district in Sun City and she,

424
00:23:52,011 --> 00:23:53,180
the government stepped in.

425
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:56,030
My grandma was able to get
in touch with Marsha Farney,

426
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:59,090
Marsha Farney state representative
I of House district one.

427
00:23:59,091 --> 00:24:02,330
She's a Republican member of the
Texas House of Representatives.

428
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:04,400
We would get together. I
do with my staff and say,

429
00:24:04,401 --> 00:24:06,260
what are the calls we've
had come in this week?

430
00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:10,430
And this one really caught our attention.
So usually heard about it. She said,

431
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:12,890
we need to do something
about this. And she did

432
00:24:13,610 --> 00:24:18,410
this bill isn't as chimp to get
a birth certificate for those.

433
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:21,170
Around a month after her
face video went viral,

434
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:24,580
Marsha Ferny put together a bill
and brought it before the House of

435
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:25,413
Representatives in Austin.

436
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:30,300
The committee already read about
this bill and they are keenly aware.

437
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,080
So the bill does a couple of things.

438
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:37,170
It makes the process logistically easier
expanded where someone could apply for

439
00:24:38,021 --> 00:24:39,440
a delayed birth certificate. It was,

440
00:24:39,490 --> 00:24:43,510
but also outlines punishments for the
parents. So in the case of faith, right,

441
00:24:43,511 --> 00:24:47,260
if she asked her parents for
documentation and they refused,

442
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:52,320
then that's punishable by up to a year
in jail and up to $4,000 of a fine or a

443
00:24:53,711 --> 00:24:55,900
combination of both. Yeah.

444
00:24:56,070 --> 00:24:56,671
Mr Chairman,

445
00:24:56,671 --> 00:24:59,910
I know they are full of witnesses
here who want to testify on this bill

446
00:24:59,970 --> 00:25:04,410
and they held this hearing to kind
of weigh the various sides. Hi,

447
00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:07,890
I'm Alicia Southworth
live in Georgetown, Texas,

448
00:25:07,950 --> 00:25:12,150
and I'm and so faith and her aunt
and her grandma all went to testify.

449
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:15,060
Faith is my granddaughter and my namesake.

450
00:25:15,270 --> 00:25:19,410
I was in the room the day she was
born. Unfortunately that is not okay.

451
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:22,690
Her grandma fills in the state wraps
on what they'd been doing the last six

452
00:25:22,691 --> 00:25:22,980
months.

453
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:26,910
We went to the DPS to get her a driver's
license and they said no. They said,

454
00:25:26,911 --> 00:25:29,940
go to the social security
people. Security people said no.

455
00:25:29,970 --> 00:25:31,840
Go to the voter registration people

456
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:34,420
meetings and dead ends and rejections.

457
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:38,800
No, go to the DPS. We
were stuck in a do loop.

458
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:42,850
Well, I wasn't gonna quit there
for goodness sake. She's a Texan.

459
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:48,780
So Marsha Farney has offered us our only
hope we have had since this started.

460
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:52,030
I just, I urge you to pass this bill,

461
00:25:52,390 --> 00:25:56,310
take faith out of limbo and give
her the life she desires might be.

462
00:25:56,380 --> 00:26:00,010
It was just like we would not allow my
parent to physically handicap a child.

463
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:04,690
We should not allow a parent to handicap
a child where they can't operate and

464
00:26:04,691 --> 00:26:06,670
function in society. She is truly,

465
00:26:07,450 --> 00:26:10,360
although you've seen her
standing here a nonperson,

466
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:15,700
she could walk off the face of the earth
and legally nobody would know she was

467
00:26:15,701 --> 00:26:16,534
gone.

468
00:26:19,770 --> 00:26:23,760
I think the bill is a little misguided.
That's James Pennington face dad.

469
00:26:23,761 --> 00:26:27,780
He came out to the hearing and ended
up on the Fox seven newscast and

470
00:26:27,810 --> 00:26:31,350
unfortunately this is the only
bit of tape we have of him.

471
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:35,250
He provides some pretty
draconian penalties for a
process. It's already there.

472
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:40,160
There are six other children, I
think. I don't disagree with that.

473
00:26:40,161 --> 00:26:44,220
I mean just the state of Texas want to
put start putting parents jail. Well,

474
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:47,700
the bill gives the judge some leeway based
on what the circumstances are for the

475
00:26:47,701 --> 00:26:49,200
parents, but we,

476
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:53,620
we felt there was a need for
some teeth to this bill to Ganda.

477
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:57,000
It turns out that the Texas State
House and State Senate agreed,

478
00:26:57,030 --> 00:27:00,330
so we were able to get it
through the house and the Senate.

479
00:27:00,450 --> 00:27:04,440
The bill ended up passing, Republicans
voted for it. Democrats voted for it.

480
00:27:04,470 --> 00:27:06,240
There was actually only one, no vote,

481
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:09,120
but the next time Marsha for
any was up for reelection.

482
00:27:09,121 --> 00:27:11,250
She actually lost in the primaries.

483
00:27:11,670 --> 00:27:16,260
And according to the Texas observer who
actually did a really nice podcast of

484
00:27:16,261 --> 00:27:17,094
face story,

485
00:27:17,430 --> 00:27:21,300
there's this lobbying group called the
Texas homeschool coalition who donated a

486
00:27:21,301 --> 00:27:22,920
bunch of money to Farnese primary

487
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:27,360
opponent who's parental
revenge I guess. Okay.

488
00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:29,640
But then what, so where does your,
does that leave faith though?

489
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:30,760
Well, um,

490
00:27:30,761 --> 00:27:34,420
because of the bill faith was able to
take her case to a different court,

491
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:35,440
a higher court,

492
00:27:35,890 --> 00:27:39,700
and it seems like the bill allowed the
judge to consider different kinds of

493
00:27:39,730 --> 00:27:40,301
evidence.

494
00:27:40,301 --> 00:27:44,620
So in the end faith was able to use an
old orthodontist record and a piece of

495
00:27:44,621 --> 00:27:46,270
paper from her uncle,

496
00:27:46,271 --> 00:27:49,630
a doctor who had treated her
toe back when she was a kid.

497
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:52,210
And in just a couple of weeks,

498
00:27:52,850 --> 00:27:54,800
success is the by certificate.

499
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:57,740
Sometimes I just take it out and
look at it sometimes randomly.

500
00:27:57,890 --> 00:28:00,470
I know it's like, it's so dumb. It's
like it's your birth certificate.

501
00:28:00,471 --> 00:28:03,020
Every person has one. But
I'm like, I have one too.

502
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:07,610
Can you read it to me a little bit? Like
what's, what information is on here?

503
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:13,730
Um, it has my name at the top and
it has like my description, my sex,

504
00:28:13,910 --> 00:28:15,020
where I was born,

505
00:28:15,850 --> 00:28:18,370
the county, just what county
does it say you're born in?

506
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:20,080
Harris County was born in Houston.

507
00:28:20,850 --> 00:28:21,683
Ah.

508
00:28:26,550 --> 00:28:31,550
I'm hoping that the physical papers can
like mirror the emotional thing that

509
00:28:33,571 --> 00:28:36,900
she's going through because I feel like
it's like as she's getting the papers

510
00:28:36,930 --> 00:28:40,080
she's appearing so that by the
time she gets that last one,

511
00:28:40,081 --> 00:28:43,740
she will know who she is and then she
will be that person, whoever that is.

512
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,750
She's working so hard for it.

513
00:28:46,290 --> 00:28:51,240
I'm hoping that that just that will
have developed in her something that she

514
00:28:51,241 --> 00:28:55,770
feels like it's more than a piece
of paper, you know? Yeah. I'm hoping

515
00:28:57,330 --> 00:29:00,330
so. Now faith, she was actually
able to get a driver's license,

516
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:04,920
but she still doesn't have her social
security number a which means she can't

517
00:29:04,921 --> 00:29:08,610
get a real job. She can't open up
a bank account. She's still really,

518
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:12,570
she can vote, but she
can't get health insurance.

519
00:29:12,810 --> 00:29:14,790
She might not be able to go to college,

520
00:29:15,390 --> 00:29:18,120
so I don't know what's
going to happen to her.

521
00:29:19,410 --> 00:29:22,500
We were asking her this question
like, when this is all over,

522
00:29:22,770 --> 00:29:26,520
do you know who you're going to be? You
know, because now this is who you are.

523
00:29:26,521 --> 00:29:28,650
You're the girl with no identity. And uh,

524
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:32,730
she was a little concerned that she
wouldn't know who she was going to be if

525
00:29:33,150 --> 00:29:36,620
your, if your aunt asked you that
same question again, like who do,

526
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:39,440
who do you think you are now?
Who Do you think you are? No, I'm

527
00:29:41,910 --> 00:29:43,960
[inaudible] what, how
would you answer that now?

528
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:48,440
Um, I don't know. Like
I just feel like me,

529
00:29:50,690 --> 00:29:53,920
like I'm just faith.

530
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:55,493
Cool.

531
00:30:07,730 --> 00:30:10,220
Cute. Thanks to recording
producer Alexandra young.

532
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:14,360
This piece is also produced by Brenna
feral and Andy Mills and we had a lot of

533
00:30:14,361 --> 00:30:18,560
help from a lot of Texans, I should
say. Uh, I think they're mostly Texans.

534
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:23,660
Savannah Escobar, Rachel Komen, David
Glenn, Chris van Dusen, Zen Alegbra,

535
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:27,170
Russell Waylon, liberty
consultant, Nick Reed, the group,

536
00:30:27,171 --> 00:30:31,700
homeschool alumni reaching out and the
Lake Travis Zip line adventure company.

537
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:36,480
Speaking of that last one, as you say,
when I went to go visit faith in Austin,

538
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:41,340
uh, she's got green hair now.
She's got a nose ring and a tattoo.

539
00:30:41,610 --> 00:30:43,110
She goes home from time to time.

540
00:30:43,111 --> 00:30:47,280
And she actually visited with her mom on
mother's Day. Um, but when I was there,

541
00:30:47,281 --> 00:30:50,280
she wanted to do something with
me that she'd never done before.

542
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:55,650
I'm so excited you guys. So
we decided to go zip lining.

543
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,840
He said Zyban six,

544
00:30:58,290 --> 00:31:03,290
and this one just happened to
be called the leap of faith.

545
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:05,293
Okay.

546
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:12,713
[inaudible]

547
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:13,953
yeah.

548
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:39,690
Hey, this is Jack. One last
thing before we close. Um,

549
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:43,140
I wanted to let you know that this
fall I'm actually going to be, uh,

550
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:48,190
doing something that I haven't done in
the 14 years that I have been working on

551
00:31:48,191 --> 00:31:53,170
radio lab. I'm gonna take a little
time off. So, uh, you will not hear me,

552
00:31:53,550 --> 00:31:56,290
uh, producing or hosting this
podcast through the fall.

553
00:31:56,291 --> 00:32:00,730
I will be back early
January. Uh, and you know,

554
00:32:00,731 --> 00:32:02,500
the reason is very simply that, you know,

555
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:07,870
in creating this show and then building
it up and then going on for live tours

556
00:32:07,871 --> 00:32:11,770
and then most recently
creating the spinoff, our
first spinoff more perfect. Uh,

557
00:32:11,890 --> 00:32:13,570
just need, I mean, it's
all been incredible,

558
00:32:13,571 --> 00:32:18,400
but I just need a moment to catch my
breath and to reacquaint myself with my

559
00:32:18,401 --> 00:32:22,990
children. So I'm going to be doing
that. But the great thing is that, um,

560
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:23,231
you know,

561
00:32:23,231 --> 00:32:26,920
as much as Radiolab is this thing that I
started with Robert and with Ellen, um,

562
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:32,320
it's now as you know, home to a hugely
talented, amazing group of people. Uh,

563
00:32:32,321 --> 00:32:36,190
so you'll be hearing more of them.
I mean, Robert, my partner in crime,

564
00:32:36,310 --> 00:32:40,010
we'll be holding it down, but you'll
be hearing a lot more of Molly Webster,

565
00:32:40,310 --> 00:32:42,320
a Soren, and a lot different.

566
00:32:42,321 --> 00:32:45,500
Simon and the whole crew
will be doing stories.

567
00:32:46,370 --> 00:32:49,130
And I happen to know there's some pretty
amazing stuff coming down the pike and

568
00:32:49,131 --> 00:32:49,761
I, for one,

569
00:32:49,761 --> 00:32:54,761
am really excited to be able to listen
to it from the outside for the first

570
00:32:55,071 --> 00:32:59,120
time. So yeah, now we're making
a few appearances here and there.

571
00:32:59,121 --> 00:33:03,140
So if you find yourself in like
Missoula, Montana or Sydney or Melbourne,

572
00:33:03,141 --> 00:33:05,960
Australia, uh, come say, hey,

573
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:08,240
otherwise I will see you in the new year.
