00:00:00.167 --> 00:00:02.245
- [Voiceover] Let k equal four,

00:00:02.245 --> 00:00:05.961
so that f of x is equal to one
over x squared minus four x.

00:00:05.961 --> 00:00:08.738
Determine whether f
has a relative minimum,

00:00:08.738 --> 00:00:12.449
a relative maximum, or
neither at x equals two.

00:00:12.449 --> 00:00:15.329
Justify your answer.

00:00:15.329 --> 00:00:16.051
All right.

00:00:16.051 --> 00:00:18.883
Well, if f of x is equal
to this, then f prime of x,

00:00:18.883 --> 00:00:21.655
they gave us f prime of x in terms of k.

00:00:21.655 --> 00:00:24.808
So f prime of x

00:00:24.808 --> 00:00:26.123
is going to be equal to,

00:00:26.123 --> 00:00:27.237
in this case k is four.

00:00:27.237 --> 00:00:29.756
So it's gonna be four minus two x.

00:00:29.756 --> 00:00:31.428
Four minus two x.

00:00:31.428 --> 00:00:35.138
Over x squared minus

00:00:35.138 --> 00:00:37.388
four x squared

00:00:37.388 --> 00:00:40.763
minus four x

00:00:40.763 --> 00:00:42.586
minus four x squared.

00:00:42.586 --> 00:00:45.595
So now we know f of x
and we know f prime of x.

00:00:45.595 --> 00:00:47.879
And if we were looking for relative minima

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.329
or relative maxima,

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:53.676
we would be interested in
points, and critical points.

00:00:53.676 --> 00:00:57.124
And especially where f
prime of x is equal to zero.

00:00:57.124 --> 00:01:01.591
And so if we said f prime
of x is equal to zero,

00:01:01.591 --> 00:01:04.982
well, we would say, when does
this numerator equal zero?

00:01:04.982 --> 00:01:09.326
And so you could say, when does
four minus two x equal zero?

00:01:09.326 --> 00:01:12.919
You add two x to both sides,
you get four is equal to two x.

00:01:12.919 --> 00:01:16.774
Or x is equal to two, x is equal to two.

00:01:16.774 --> 00:01:17.868
And they told us that.

00:01:17.868 --> 00:01:19.608
Or I guess we've confirmed that

00:01:19.608 --> 00:01:23.830
at f prime of two

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:26.857
does indeed equal to zero.

00:01:26.857 --> 00:01:29.881
So this is definitely
an interesting point.

00:01:29.881 --> 00:01:32.207
So let's think about whether before,

00:01:32.207 --> 00:01:34.087
when x is less than two,

00:01:34.087 --> 00:01:37.187
is f prime of x increasing or decreasing?

00:01:37.187 --> 00:01:39.149
And then when x is greater than two,

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:41.727
is f prime of x increasing or decreasing?

00:01:41.727 --> 00:01:44.792
And that will let us know if
this is a minima or a maxima.

00:01:44.792 --> 00:01:45.940
So let's say,

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:50.715
so when x is less than two,

00:01:50.715 --> 00:01:52.508
we could test something out.

00:01:52.508 --> 00:01:54.704
We could say f prime of,

00:01:54.704 --> 00:01:57.770
so let's just say f prime of one.

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:00.323
So if x is less than two.

00:02:00.323 --> 00:02:01.208
You know, you actually don't even

00:02:01.208 --> 00:02:02.822
have to test f prime of one.

00:02:02.822 --> 00:02:03.927
Ii mean, you could if you want.

00:02:03.927 --> 00:02:06.659
You would have four minus two.

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.211
Four minus two times one.

00:02:08.211 --> 00:02:10.539
So that's going to be positive.

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:11.704
And then this down over here

00:02:11.704 --> 00:02:14.095
is always going to be non-negative.

00:02:14.095 --> 00:02:16.527
Because you have a
squared right over here.

00:02:16.527 --> 00:02:18.330
So when x is less than two,

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:22.369
f prime of x is greater than zero.

00:02:22.369 --> 00:02:25.494
And you could try this out with
different exes if you like.

00:02:25.494 --> 00:02:27.378
You could say, for example,

00:02:27.378 --> 00:02:29.799
for example,

00:02:30.843 --> 00:02:33.682
f prime of one is equal to

00:02:33.682 --> 00:02:36.017
four minus two, which is two

00:02:36.017 --> 00:02:39.704
over one minus four.

00:02:39.704 --> 00:02:41.931
Which is negative three, but then squared.

00:02:41.931 --> 00:02:44.965
Is equal to two ninths.

00:02:44.965 --> 00:02:46.387
And then we could say

00:02:47.227 --> 00:02:52.227
when x is greater than two,

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.397
f prime of x,

00:02:55.407 --> 00:02:57.160
f prime of x.

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:58.903
Well, when x is greater than two,

00:02:58.903 --> 00:03:02.026
you're gonna have four minus two times

00:03:02.026 --> 00:03:04.337
something larger than four.

00:03:04.337 --> 00:03:05.812
So this is going to be negative.

00:03:05.812 --> 00:03:08.097
So f prime of x is going
to be less than zero.

00:03:08.097 --> 00:03:09.855
Up here's gonna be negative.

00:03:09.855 --> 00:03:11.646
Down here's not going to be negative.

00:03:11.646 --> 00:03:14.606
And so f prime of x is
going to be less than zero.

00:03:14.606 --> 00:03:18.711
So if we are increasing
as we approach something,

00:03:18.711 --> 00:03:20.901
and then our slope is zero.

00:03:20.901 --> 00:03:22.929
And then we are decreasing,

00:03:22.929 --> 00:03:25.937
well then this is going
to be a maximum point.

00:03:25.937 --> 00:03:28.508
So that means that

00:03:28.508 --> 00:03:30.281
we have a maximum,

00:03:31.121 --> 00:03:32.703
maximum point

00:03:33.663 --> 00:03:34.585
point

00:03:34.585 --> 00:03:37.112
at x is equal

00:03:37.112 --> 00:03:40.002
at x is equal to,

00:03:40.002 --> 00:03:41.767
or we could say, yes.

00:03:41.767 --> 00:03:44.824
That we have, f has a relative maximum,

00:03:44.824 --> 00:03:47.220
relative maximum

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:49.578
at x equals,

00:03:49.578 --> 00:03:51.042
at x equals two.

00:03:51.042 --> 00:03:52.409
Actually, let's make it right.

00:03:52.409 --> 00:03:55.611
X has a relative maximum.

00:03:55.611 --> 00:03:56.962
We're just going to use
the words they are using.

00:03:56.962 --> 00:03:58.627
Relative,

00:03:58.627 --> 00:04:01.705
relative maximum

00:04:01.705 --> 00:04:05.019
at x is equal to two.

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:06.956
Now another way that you
could have tried to do it

00:04:06.956 --> 00:04:07.901
is you could have tried to take

00:04:07.901 --> 00:04:09.315
the second derivative of this

00:04:09.315 --> 00:04:12.197
and then saw whether that
was positive or negative,

00:04:12.197 --> 00:04:14.043
and whether it was concave
upwards or downwards.

00:04:14.043 --> 00:04:15.928
But taking the second derivative of this,

00:04:15.928 --> 00:04:17.141
it gets quite hairy.

00:04:17.141 --> 00:04:18.849
And any time you're taking the AP test

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:20.016
and you find yourself going down

00:04:20.016 --> 00:04:21.599
a really, really hairy path.

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:23.583
Like taking the derivative of,

00:04:23.583 --> 00:04:25.650
or like taking the second derivative of f,

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:27.860
which would be the first
derivative of f prime.

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:30.598
Any time you see yourself going
down a hairy path like that,

00:04:30.598 --> 00:04:34.468
it might work, but it's
probably not the optimal path.

00:04:34.468 --> 00:04:36.186
So an easier way is to just think,

00:04:36.186 --> 00:04:39.345
okay, well what is f prime
doing as we approach this?

00:04:39.345 --> 00:04:40.264
Or another way is thinking,

00:04:40.264 --> 00:04:43.650
is the function increasing
as we approach from below?

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:46.242
And is it increasing or decreasing

00:04:46.242 --> 00:04:50.742
as we get beyond that
point, beyond x equals two?
