00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.780
So in workflows, we were able to say whenever an entry is created or whatever,

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:06.140
we're not doing that here, and that's because

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:08.140
we're manually hitting the submit for approval button.

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:08.620
&gt;&gt; Exactly.

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:13.270
&gt;&gt; Okay. Okay, so select approver using the options below.

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:17.830
Who should this approval request be assigned to? So this again

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:20.380
is something that would be a lot more dynamic if we

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:22.600
had a lot of users in our orginization that had roles.

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:22.950
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:25.180
&gt;&gt; You could assign it specifically based off of the role

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:28.840
hierarchy in the company. Because maybe you want certain managers to approve it.

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:31.020
&gt;&gt; So that would be the hierarchy field, I assume?

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:34.240
&gt;&gt; Yep. Or you could, you know, choose that

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:37.150
Approver manually. Assign it to a queue. In this

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:39.460
case we're just going to automatically assign it to ourselves

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:41.280
since we're the only user that could approve anyway.

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.520
&gt;&gt; So what does that mean. Who should I?

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:46.940
&gt;&gt; Automatically Assign Approvers, and then just choose Yourself.

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:49.640
&gt;&gt; Save?

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:50.100
&gt;&gt; And

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.750
Save. So, I just want to call out, that that's really not the

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:58.560
most realistic, as far as, you know, we would always be the approver.

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:02.990
The real dynamic, you know, power behind approval processes, is that you could

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:06.140
get anyone that needs to approve it, based off of their role, or.

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:07.780
&gt;&gt; Their position in the company, yeah.

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:09.750
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm. Alright. So this is explaining how

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.610
you're going to build out the approval process. So this

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.490
is another one of those setup windows that, if

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:15.260
I weren't here right now, this is how you'd

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:16.160
teach yourself how to do it.

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.500
&gt;&gt; Sure.

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.500
&gt;&gt; But let's just go to the Approval Process Detail Page.
