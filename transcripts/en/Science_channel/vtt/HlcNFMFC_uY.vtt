00:00:05.267 --> 00:00:09.868
Narrator:
TO MAKE THE DIVING-BOARD SHELL,
WORKERS LOAD A SHEET OF ACRYLIC

00:00:09.868 --> 00:00:13.100
INTO A CLAMPING MACHINE
THAT TRANSPORTS IT INTO AN OVEN.

00:00:16.133 --> 00:00:19.667
THE OVEN HEATS THE SHEET FOR
ABOUT 30 SECONDS TO SOFTEN IT.

00:00:19.667 --> 00:00:22.167
THEN, A FORMING MACHINE
APPLIES SUCTION

00:00:22.167 --> 00:00:25.133
TO DRAW THE SOFTENED ACRYLIC
TIGHTLY OVER A MOLD

00:00:25.133 --> 00:00:27.734
IN THE SHAPE
OF TWO DIVING BOARDS.

00:00:27.734 --> 00:00:29.167
FANS BLOW COOL AIR,

00:00:29.167 --> 00:00:32.767
HARDENING THE ACRYLIC
TO THIS SHAPE WITHIN SECONDS.

00:00:32.767 --> 00:00:35.000
THEY EXTRACT THE MOLDED ACRYLIC,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.567
THEN SAW IT IN HALF TO SEPARATE
THE TWO DIVING-BOARD SHELLS.

00:00:39.567 --> 00:00:44.234
THEY COAT THE SHELL SURFACE IN
A RESIN-AND-FIBERGLASS MIXTURE.

00:00:45.634 --> 00:00:48.100
THIS TOOL
IS CALLED A CHOPPER GUN

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:51.200
BECAUSE IT CHOPS AND SHREDS
THE FIBERGLASS STRING,

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.033
THEN SHOOTS IT OUT
DRENCHED IN RESIN.

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:01.234
THEY ROLL IT TO COMPRESS THE
FIBERS AND PUSH OUT AIR POCKETS.

00:01:01.234 --> 00:01:05.834
ANY TRAPPED AIR WOULD CREATE
A WEAK SPOT IN THE DIVING BOARD.

00:01:05.834 --> 00:01:09.133
AFTER LETTING THE RESIN DRY
AND HARDEN FOR 30 MINUTES,

00:01:09.133 --> 00:01:11.067
THEY BEGIN
FILLING THE SHELL CAVITY

00:01:11.067 --> 00:01:14.501
WITH .2-INCH THICK
FIBERGLASS MAT.

00:01:14.501 --> 00:01:17.267
THEN THEY LAY DOWN
ANOTHER FIBERGLASS MAT,

00:01:17.267 --> 00:01:18.734
THIS ONE A BIT THINNER

00:01:18.734 --> 00:01:21.534
AND SATURATED
WITH THE EXISTING RESIN.

00:01:22.934 --> 00:01:26.067
THE DIVING BOARD'S CORE
IS MADE OF LAMINATED WOOD,

00:01:26.067 --> 00:01:29.501
WHICH IS SEVERAL THIN LAYERS
OF WOOD GLUED TOGETHER.

00:01:29.501 --> 00:01:31.701
LAMINATED WOOD
IS ACTUALLY STRONGER

00:01:31.701 --> 00:01:33.934
THAN A SOLID PIECE OF WOOD.

00:01:35.067 --> 00:01:39.534
AFTER ROUNDING THE TOP EDGE,
THEY LAY TWO WOOD-LAMINATE CORES

00:01:39.534 --> 00:01:42.868
OVER THE RESIN-SATURATED
FIBERGLASS MATS.

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:49.367
THEY POSITION CLAMPS
TO HOLD THE CORES IN PLACE,

00:01:49.367 --> 00:01:51.734
THEN LET THE RESIN CURE
AT ROOM TEMPERATURE

00:01:51.734 --> 00:01:54.267
FOR A HALF HOUR OR SO.

00:01:55.467 --> 00:01:59.367
THEN THE CLAMPS COME OFF,
AND WORKERS COVER THE CORES

00:01:59.367 --> 00:02:03.200
WITH AN EVEN THICKER FIBERGLASS
MAT IMPREGNATED WITH RESIN.

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.667
THIS IS THE BOTTOM
OF THE DIVING BOARD.

00:02:08.434 --> 00:02:10.701
THEY MAKE SURE
THE MAT IS CENTERED...

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.300
...THEN MANUALLY FORM IT
TO THE SHAPE OF THE BOARD,

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:19.000
PUSHING OUT THE AIR POCKETS
AS THEY GO.

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.767
THEY SPRAY ON
SOME DECORATIVE PAINT,

00:02:27.767 --> 00:02:32.133
THEN PUT THE BOARD IN AN OVEN
FOR 24 HOURS TO CURE.

00:02:32.133 --> 00:02:34.934
WHEN IT COMES OUT,
THEY USE A DIAMOND BLADE

00:02:34.934 --> 00:02:38.434
TO SAW OFF THE EXCESS FIBERGLASS
AROUND THE EDGE.

00:02:43.367 --> 00:02:45.167
THEN THEY DO A FINAL TRIMMING

00:02:45.167 --> 00:02:47.801
TO MAKE THE EDGE
NEAT AND SMOOTH.

00:02:52.133 --> 00:02:56.334
THEY MASK THE SIDES WITH TAPE,
LEAVING ONLY THE TOP EXPOSED.

00:02:56.334 --> 00:02:59.067
THIS IS WHERE THEY'LL NOW APPLY
A ROUGH TEXTURE --

00:02:59.067 --> 00:03:01.667
A SAFE, NON-SLIP SURFACE.

00:03:03.467 --> 00:03:07.033
FIRST, THEY ROLL ON
A THIN COAT OF RESIN.

00:03:09.334 --> 00:03:12.434
ONTO THAT, THEY SPRINKLE A LAYER
OF SILICA SAND,

00:03:12.434 --> 00:03:16.133
MAKING SURE TO COVER THE SURFACE
THOROUGHLY AND EVENLY.

00:03:17.434 --> 00:03:19.267
THE SAND STICKS TO THE RESIN,

00:03:19.267 --> 00:03:22.634
WHICH SETS AND CURES
IN ABOUT 15 MINUTES.

00:03:23.968 --> 00:03:27.033
AFTER SWEEPING OFF THE
EXCESS SAND THAT DIDN'T ADHERE,

00:03:27.033 --> 00:03:29.467
THEY ROLL ON A COAT
OF LAMINATING RESIN,

00:03:29.467 --> 00:03:30.968
WHICH BONDS TO THE SAND,

00:03:30.968 --> 00:03:34.200
GIVING THE SURFACE
A CLEAN, FINISHED LOOK.

00:03:40.701 --> 00:03:42.501
THEY PULL OFF THE TAPE

00:03:42.501 --> 00:03:45.767
AND APPLY THE MANUFACTURER'S
DECAL TO THE SIDE.

00:03:47.634 --> 00:03:49.901
THE DIVING BOARD IS NOW ALL SET
TO BE INSTALLED

00:03:49.901 --> 00:03:52.634
ON A STAND
AT THE EDGE OF THE DEEP END

00:03:52.634 --> 00:03:55.467
TO AWAIT ANYONE
READY TO TAKE THE PLUNGE.
