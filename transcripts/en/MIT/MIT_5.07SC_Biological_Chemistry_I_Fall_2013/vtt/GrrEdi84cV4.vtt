JOHN ESSIGMANN: As I
mentioned, I'm diabetic.

00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:07.770
And when things that
I noticed in my dad,

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.140
before he knew he was diabetic--

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:12.300
he'd come home from
the train at night,

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:17.830
and my sister and I would rub
his legs, because they hurt.

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:19.650
This is one of the
problems with diabetics.

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.360
His feet hurt.

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:26.750
And I remember my sister
Nancy saying once, gee.

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:31.350
Daddy smells like Mommy's
nail polish remover.

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:33.280
Which was acetone.

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:36.060
And acetone is one of
the three ketone bodies,

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:38.760
the other two being
Beta-Hydroxybutyric

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.340
acid and acetoacetate.

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.370
So what happens in
diabetes is, the diabetic

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.090
doesn't have ample carbohydrate
reserves within their cells

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:53.430
as glycogen. So they're doing
a lot of fatty acid oxidation,

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.680
rather than
carbohydrate metabolism.

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:58.530
If you take a fatty
acid, and you break it

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.860
down to Acetyl-CoA,
the last step

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:03.250
is called
Beta-ketothiolase-- backs up,

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:05.670
then your two
carbons of Acetyl-CoA

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.920
will be four carbons
of acetoacetate.

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:12.840
And then acetoacetate-- a
third Acetyl-CoA can add to it

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.025
to form what's called
hydroxy-methylglutaryl-coenzyme

00:01:16.025 --> 00:01:17.110
A--

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:18.900
HMG CoA.

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.330
And then rearrangements
can happen

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.410
that give rise, ultimately,
to the three ketone bodies--

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:27.420
acetoacetate,
Beta-Hydroxybutyrate,

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.470
and acetone.

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:33.000
So in situations
where-- of starvation--

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.770
and diabetes is
basically, my cells

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.150
were in a technical
state of starvation.

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.950
In a case of
starvation, what happens

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.570
is you get this backup
of the lipid breakdown,

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:46.890
or catabolism pathway.

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.850
And then these ketone bodies
flush out into your blood.

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.580
In starvation situations,
the ketone bodies

00:01:53.580 --> 00:02:00.550
will act as fuels for your
brain and other organs.

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:02.610
It's a difficult transition.

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.640
But ketone bodies are--

00:02:07.686 --> 00:02:09.060
in the case of
diabetics, they're

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.530
produced to excess, to such
extent that they're actually

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:14.940
quite harmful to you.

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.120
The reason a person
smells of acetone

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.530
is the intermediate
ketone body--

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:25.680
the acetoacetate
basically decarboxylates.

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.590
It's a Beta-keto
acid, and so it's

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:32.160
a spontaneous decomposition
to form acetone.

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.030
Acetone is not, to my
knowledge, biochemically

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.340
useful as a kind of
an energy source.

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.020
But it's a sentinel,
or it's something

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:47.720
that is smelled, so that it can
be diagnostic of the disease.
