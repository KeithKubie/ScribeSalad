00:00:13.226 --> 00:00:14.686
&gt;&gt;Jon: The Flipped 
class requires us

00:00:14.686 --> 00:00:17.556
to fundamentally rethink
two important aspects

00:00:17.556 --> 00:00:20.106
of education, space and time.

00:00:20.106 --> 00:00:22.326
&gt;&gt;Aaron: So let's talk a
little bit about space.

00:00:23.186 --> 00:00:25.356
If you think about the way
classrooms have been set

00:00:25.356 --> 00:00:26.716
up traditionally.

00:00:26.716 --> 00:00:28.526
They had a chalkboard in
the front of the classroom.

00:00:28.526 --> 00:00:30.236
And then those chalkboards
become white boards.

00:00:30.236 --> 00:00:32.696
And then those white boards
became overhead projectors,

00:00:32.696 --> 00:00:34.876
which then turned
into LCD projectors

00:00:34.876 --> 00:00:36.266
that we hung on the ceiling.

00:00:36.576 --> 00:00:38.276
But really the classroom in all

00:00:38.276 --> 00:00:41.036
of those situations is
a presentation station.

00:00:41.036 --> 00:00:42.646
It's not a center of learning.

00:00:43.956 --> 00:00:45.846
When we rethink the
space of the classroom,

00:00:45.846 --> 00:00:48.786
we're reorienting how
the classroom is used,

00:00:48.786 --> 00:00:51.396
where the front of the
classroom is or where the front

00:00:51.396 --> 00:00:53.236
of the classroom isn't.

00:00:53.896 --> 00:00:57.006
&gt;&gt;Jon: All you have to really do
is rethink where are you going

00:00:57.006 --> 00:00:58.066
to put tables and chairs.

00:00:58.326 --> 00:01:00.396
But then that begs a very
interesting question,

00:01:00.606 --> 00:01:03.316
now what do you do with the
extra time you're going to have

00:01:03.316 --> 00:01:05.706
in a Flipped classroom
with the kids?

00:01:06.216 --> 00:01:08.526
&gt;&gt;Aaron: The short answer is
we don't know what the best use

00:01:08.526 --> 00:01:10.236
of your face-to-face
class time is.

00:01:10.236 --> 00:01:12.256
But what we want to encourage
you to do is to think

00:01:12.256 --> 00:01:15.016
about ways you can get your
students engaged in some

00:01:15.016 --> 00:01:17.136
of the higher order
thinking, the higher tiers

00:01:17.136 --> 00:01:19.986
of Bloom's Taxonomy, the
analysis and application

00:01:19.986 --> 00:01:22.446
and evaluation and
creation components all

00:01:22.446 --> 00:01:24.416
within the context
of the content

00:01:24.416 --> 00:01:26.296
that they've already learned
before they come to class

00:01:26.536 --> 00:01:30.046
in better ways with an expert
in the room, a contentary expert

00:01:30.046 --> 00:01:31.046
and a learning expert.

00:01:31.046 --> 00:01:32.106
And that expert is you.

00:01:32.166 --> 00:01:33.686
&gt;&gt;Jon: This probably
sounds familiar,

00:01:34.346 --> 00:01:36.956
project-based learning,
PBL, universal design

00:01:36.956 --> 00:01:38.676
for learning, inquiry learning.

00:01:38.946 --> 00:01:41.246
These learning pedagogies
fit greatly

00:01:41.246 --> 00:01:42.966
in a Flipped Learning
environment.

00:01:43.806 --> 00:01:46.426
&gt;&gt;Aaron: In short, a Flipped 
classroom is a way for teachers

00:01:46.426 --> 00:01:49.106
to transition into the
role of facilitator,

00:01:49.106 --> 00:01:50.636
becoming that guide on the side.

00:01:50.896 --> 00:01:53.616
We really see the Flipped 
classroom as a transitional tool

00:01:53.616 --> 00:01:56.826
for educators to move away from
being the center of attention

00:01:56.826 --> 00:01:59.786
in the classroom and move
that attention onto students

00:01:59.896 --> 00:02:02.896
and onto the learning that's
happening in those classrooms.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.000
