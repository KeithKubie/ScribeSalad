00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.120
Let's look at a solution
to our TLB size quiz.

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:08.730
We have a cache that is 32 kB in
size and has a 64 B block size.

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.150
We have a 4 kB page size.

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:15.640
So the question is how many TLB entries
do we need to have a similar hit rate

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:18.280
and miss rate to our cache.

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:23.700
Well, if the processor is just
accessing up to 32 kB of memory,

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:28.850
then our TLB needs to cover the same
amount of memory that the cache does,

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:31.450
and that means we need eight pages.

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:34.590
Now it looks like this
would be the best answer.

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.100
However, if the processor is not
accessing all of the data in each of

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:45.030
the pages, then we would need more pages
to cover the same amount of memory

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:50.020
because in the cache with
a 64 B block size, we

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:55.600
can fit 512 different blocks, and they
can be spread around the whole memory.

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:56.250
In contrast,

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.320
with eight entries in the TLB, we can
only be accessing eight different pages,

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.850
while these 500 blocks theoretically
could be in 512 different pages.

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.728
So our TLB, in this case, needs to
have up to 512 different pages in

00:01:10.728 --> 00:01:14.830
order to have hits for
the same data that the cache does.

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:17.450
In reality,
the number of pages we need for

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:20.480
the same hit rate will be
somewhere in between these two.

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:22.060
So this is the best answer.
