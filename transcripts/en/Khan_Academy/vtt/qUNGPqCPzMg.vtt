00:00:00.551 --> 00:00:02.050
So what we're going
to attempt to do

00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:05.570
is evaluate this
sum right over here,

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:08.109
evaluate what this
series is, negative 2

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:11.660
over n plus 1 times n plus
2, starting at n equals 2,

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:13.750
all the way to infinity.

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:16.850
And if we wanted to see what
this looks like, it starts at n

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:17.400
equals 2.

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.430
So when n equals 2, this
is negative 2 over 2

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.370
plus 1, which is 3, times
2 plus 2, which is 4.

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:28.940
Then when n is equal to 3,
this is negative 2 over 3

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:32.560
plus 1, which is 4, times
3 plus 2, which is 5.

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:34.820
And it just keeps going
like that, negative 2

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:37.670
over 5 times 6.

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:40.620
And it just keeps
going on and on and on.

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.880
And now, it looks pretty clear
that each successive term

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:45.620
is getting smaller.

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:47.680
And it's getting
smaller reasonably fast.

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:51.814
So it's reasonable to assume
that even though you have

00:00:51.814 --> 00:00:53.480
an infinite number
of terms, it actually

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:54.842
might give you a finite value.

00:00:54.842 --> 00:00:56.800
But it doesn't jump out
at me, at least the way

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.470
that I've looked
at it right now,

00:00:58.470 --> 00:00:59.970
as to what this sum
would be, or how

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:02.120
to actually figure out that sum.

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.269
So what I want you to do
now is pause this video.

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:07.630
And I'm going to give you a hint
about how to think about this.

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:12.170
Try to dig up your memories
of partial fraction expansion,

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:14.160
or partial fraction
decomposition,

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:17.920
to turn this expression into
the sum of two fractions.

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:22.280
And that might help us think
about what this sum is.

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.337
So I'm assuming you've
given a go at it.

00:01:24.337 --> 00:01:25.920
So let's try to
manipulate this thing.

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.840
And let's see if we can rewrite
this as a sum of two fractions.

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.870
So this is negative
2 over-- and I'm

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:35.990
going to do this in two
different colors-- n plus 1

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:37.650
times n plus 2.

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:42.870
And we remember from our
partial fraction expansion

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:45.710
that we can rewrite this as
the sum of two fractions,

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:54.846
as A over n plus 1
plus B over n plus 2.

00:01:54.846 --> 00:01:55.970
And why is this reasonable?

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:57.090
Well, if you're
adding two fractions,

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.620
you want to find a
common denominator, which

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:00.650
would be a multiple of
the two denominators.

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:03.300
This is clearly a multiple of
both of these denominators.

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:05.660
And we learned in partial
fraction expansion

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:08.919
that whatever we have up here,
especially because the degree

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:13.020
here is lower than the degree
down here, whatever we have

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.890
up here is going to be a degree
lower than what we have here.

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:18.000
So this is a first-degree
term in terms of n,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.850
so these are going to be
constant terms up here.

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:22.740
So let's figure out
what A and B are.

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:25.580
So if we perform
the addition-- well,

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.590
let's just rewrite
both of these with

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:29.400
the same common denominator.

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:34.190
So let's rewrite
A over n plus 1,

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:37.720
but let's multiply the numerator
and denominator by n plus 2.

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:41.570
So we multiply the numerator
by n plus 2 and the denominator

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:42.100
by n plus 2.

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:44.490
I haven't changed the value
of this first fraction.

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:50.850
Similarly, let's do the same
thing with B over n plus 2.

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:54.470
Multiply the numerator and the
denominator by n plus 1, so

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:57.960
n plus 1 over n plus 1.

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:01.276
Once again, I haven't change
the value of this fraction.

00:03:01.276 --> 00:03:03.400
But by doing this, I now
have a common denominator,

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:04.570
and I can add.

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:12.714
So this is going to be equal
to n plus 1 times n plus 2 is

00:03:12.714 --> 00:03:13.380
our denominator.

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:19.690
And then our numerator--
let me expand it out.

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:21.690
This is going to be,
if I distribute the A,

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:25.290
it is An plus 2A.

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:31.730
So let me write
that, An plus 2A.

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:40.680
And then let's distribute
this B, plus Bn plus B.

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.680
Now, what I want to do
is I want to rewrite this

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.330
so I have all of the n terms.

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:51.070
So for example, An plus Bn--
I could factor an n out.

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:58.730
And I could rewrite that
as A plus B times n, those

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:00.350
two terms right over there.

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:03.895
And then these two
terms, the 2A plus B,

00:04:03.895 --> 00:04:09.080
I could just write it
like this, plus 2A plus B.

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:17.550
And, of course, all of that is
over n plus 1 times n plus 2.

00:04:20.915 --> 00:04:24.020
So how do we solve for A and B?

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:26.650
Well, the realization
is that this thing

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:29.070
must be equal to negative 2.

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:31.879
These two things must
be equal to each other.

00:04:31.879 --> 00:04:33.670
Remember, we're making
the claim that this,

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:36.160
which is the same thing
as this, is equal to this.

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:38.754
That's the whole reason
why we started doing this.

00:04:38.754 --> 00:04:40.420
So we're making the
claim that these two

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:42.680
things are equivalent.

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:44.470
We're making this claim.

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:47.560
So everything in the numerator
must be equal to negative 2.

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:48.710
So how do we do that?

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:52.130
It looks like we have
two unknowns here.

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:54.930
To figure out two unknowns, we
normally need two equations.

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:56.990
Well, the realization
here is, look,

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:00.030
we have an n term on
the left-hand side here.

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:01.520
We have no n term here.

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:03.950
So you literally could view
this, instead of just viewing

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:05.366
this as negative
2, you could view

00:05:05.366 --> 00:05:10.960
this as negative 2 plus
0n, plus 0 times n.

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:11.740
That's not "on."

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:17.599
That's 0-- let me write
it this way-- 0 times n.

00:05:17.599 --> 00:05:19.140
So when you look at
it this way, it's

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:22.430
clear that A plus B is
the coefficient on n.

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:24.700
That must be equal to 0.

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:28.340
A plus B must be equal to 0.

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:30.810
And this is kind of
bread-and-butter partial

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:32.180
fraction expansion.

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:34.530
We have other videos on that
if you need to review that.

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:43.010
And the constant part, 2A plus
B, is equal to negative 2.

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:51.020
And so now we have two
equations in two unknowns.

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:53.020
And we could solve it a
bunch of different ways.

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:55.450
But one interesting way is
let's multiply the top equation

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:56.930
by negative 1.

00:05:56.930 --> 00:06:01.090
So then this becomes negative
A minus B is equal to-- well,

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:03.360
negative 1 times 0 is still 0.

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:05.600
Now we can add these
two things together.

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:11.110
And we are left with 2A minus
A is A, plus B minus B-- well,

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:13.830
those cancel out.

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:16.320
A is equal to negative 2.

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:20.120
And if A is equal to
negative 2, A plus B is 0,

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:21.520
B must be equal to 2.

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:28.000
Negative 2 plus 2 is equal to 0.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.100
We solved for A. And then I
substituted it back up here.

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:34.860
So now we can rewrite all
of this right over here.

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:37.830
We can rewrite it as
the sum-- and actually,

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:39.200
let me do a little bit instead.

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:43.020
Let me just write it as
a finite sum as opposed

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:44.200
to an infinite sum.

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:47.450
And then we can just take the
limit as we go to infinity.

00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:49.190
So let me rewrite it like this.

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:53.700
So this is the sum from n
equals 2-- instead to infinity,

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:56.540
I'll just say to capital
N. And then later, we

00:06:56.540 --> 00:07:00.750
could take the limit as this
goes to infinity of-- well,

00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:03.850
instead of writing this, I can
write this right over here.

00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:06.370
So A is negative 2.

00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:11.110
So it's negative
2 over n plus 1.

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:17.820
And then B is 2,
plus B over n plus 2.

00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:20.610
So once again, I've just
expressed this as a finite sum.

00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:23.210
Later, we can take the limit
as capital N approaches

00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:25.020
infinity to figure out
what this thing is.

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:27.870
Oh, sorry, and B-- let
me not write B anymore.

00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:33.450
We now know that B
is 2 over n plus 2.

00:07:33.450 --> 00:07:37.850
Now, how does this actually
go about helping us?

00:07:37.850 --> 00:07:39.330
Well, let's do what
we did up here.

00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:42.260
Let's actually write out what
this is going to be equal to.

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:46.900
This is going to be
equal to-- when n is 2,

00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:54.410
this is negative 2/3, so
it's negative 2/3, plus 2/4.

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:02.810
So that's n equals-- let me
do it down here, because I'm

00:08:02.810 --> 00:08:04.400
about to run out of real estate.

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:06.640
That is when n is equal to 2.

00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:10.120
Now, what about when
n is equal to 3?

00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:21.920
When n is equal to 3, this
is going to be negative 2/4

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:22.610
plus 2/5.

00:08:28.770 --> 00:08:30.530
What about when n is equal to 4?

00:08:30.530 --> 00:08:33.890
I think you might see a pattern
that's starting to form.

00:08:33.890 --> 00:08:34.640
Let's do one more.

00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:42.090
When n is equal to
4, well, then, this

00:08:42.090 --> 00:08:46.710
is going to be
negative 2/5-- let

00:08:46.710 --> 00:08:53.170
me do that same blue color--
negative 2/5 plus 2/6.

00:08:57.640 --> 00:09:00.460
And we're just
going to keep going.

00:09:00.460 --> 00:09:02.520
Let me scroll down to
get some space-- we're

00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:05.190
going to keep going all the
way until the N-th term.

00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:13.680
So plus dot dot dot plus
our capital N-th term,

00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:24.110
which is going to be negative
2 over capital N plus 1 plus 2

00:09:24.110 --> 00:09:27.560
over capital N plus 2.

00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:29.310
So I think you might
see the pattern here.

00:09:29.310 --> 00:09:33.466
Notice, from our first when
n equals 2, we got the 2/4.

00:09:33.466 --> 00:09:35.590
But then when n equals 3,
you had the negative 2/4.

00:09:35.590 --> 00:09:37.450
That cancels with that.

00:09:37.450 --> 00:09:39.090
When n equals 3, you had 2/5.

00:09:39.090 --> 00:09:42.690
Then that cancels when n
equals 4 with the negative 2/5.

00:09:42.690 --> 00:09:47.170
So the second term cancels
with-- the second part,

00:09:47.170 --> 00:09:50.380
I guess, for each
n, for each index,

00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:53.040
cancels out with the first
part for the next index.

00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:55.420
And so that's just going to
keep happening all the way

00:09:55.420 --> 00:09:59.730
until n is equal to capital N.

00:09:59.730 --> 00:10:02.300
And so this is going to
cancel out with the one right

00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:03.110
before it.

00:10:03.110 --> 00:10:06.540
And all we're going
to be left with

00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:13.790
is this term and this
term right over here.

00:10:13.790 --> 00:10:15.950
So let's rewrite that.

00:10:15.950 --> 00:10:19.090
So we get-- let's
get more space here.

00:10:19.090 --> 00:10:26.290
This thing can be rewritten
as the sum from lowercase n

00:10:26.290 --> 00:10:30.850
equals 2 to capital
N of negative 2

00:10:30.850 --> 00:10:37.020
over n plus 1 plus
2 over n plus 2

00:10:37.020 --> 00:10:39.440
is equal to-- well, everything
else in the middle canceled

00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:39.940
out.

00:10:39.940 --> 00:10:43.740
We're just left
with negative 2/3

00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:50.460
plus 2 over capital N plus 2.

00:10:50.460 --> 00:10:53.110
So this was a huge
simplification right over here.

00:10:53.110 --> 00:10:57.000
And remember, our original sum
that we wanted to calculate,

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.510
that just has a limit as
capital N goes to infinity.

00:11:00.510 --> 00:11:04.620
So let's just take the limit
as capital N goes to infinity.

00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:06.170
So let me write it this way.

00:11:06.170 --> 00:11:07.878
Well, actually, let
me write it this way.

00:11:07.878 --> 00:11:10.810
The limit-- so we can
write it this way.

00:11:10.810 --> 00:11:15.350
The limit as
capital N approaches

00:11:15.350 --> 00:11:20.030
infinity is going to be equal
to the limit as capital N

00:11:20.030 --> 00:11:22.239
approaches infinity
of-- well, we just

00:11:22.239 --> 00:11:23.280
figured out what this is.

00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:33.240
This is negative 2/3 plus
2 over capital N plus 2.

00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:36.180
Well, as n goes to
infinity, this negative 2/3

00:11:36.180 --> 00:11:37.600
doesn't get impacted at all.

00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:40.375
This term right over here, 2
over an ever larger number,

00:11:40.375 --> 00:11:42.000
over an infinitely
large number-- well,

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:43.520
that's going to go to 0.

00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:47.990
And we're going to be
left with negative 2/3.

00:11:47.990 --> 00:11:48.750
And we're done.

00:11:48.750 --> 00:11:54.740
We were able to figure out the
sum of this infinite series.

00:11:54.740 --> 00:11:58.460
So this thing right over here
is equal to negative 2/3.

00:11:58.460 --> 00:12:01.320
And this type of series is
called a telescoping series--

00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:02.920
telescoping, I should say.

00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:04.380
This is a telescoping series.

00:12:09.270 --> 00:12:12.130
And a telescoping series
is a general term.

00:12:12.130 --> 00:12:14.500
So if you were to
take its partial sums,

00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:18.430
it has this pattern right over
here, where, in each term,

00:12:18.430 --> 00:12:20.020
you're starting to
cancel things out.

00:12:20.020 --> 00:12:23.270
So what you're left with
is just a fixed number

00:12:23.270 --> 00:12:25.520
of terms at the end.

00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:27.130
But either way,
this was a pretty--

00:12:27.130 --> 00:12:29.421
it's a little bit hairy, but
it was a pretty satisfying

00:12:29.421 --> 00:12:30.640
problem.
