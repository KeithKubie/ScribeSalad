00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.900
Combinatorics is the study of possibilities.

00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:04.520
So, you know, if you have a given set, how many subsets might it have?

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:06.720
Or if we have a given set, how can you arrange it in a line?

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.380
So I want to talk about these questions but I want to talk about them from a geometric point of view.

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:13.980
Let's do an example.  So let's say, we have a set of 3 elements A, B, and C.

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.240
Now, I want to figure out, what are the possible subsets?

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:20.900
Usually the notation that we use is {} -&gt; this one. 
But just to make it a little bit easier to read,

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:22.680
I am just going to add it like this -&gt; abc

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.180
And so, a subset is just choosing 
some of these, and... and not others.

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:29.380
And so, I might chose for example:
A, B, or C.

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:32.640
Or I might chose A and B.  Or I might chose B and C.

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:36.280
Or I might chose A and C.
I could choose all of them. Why not?

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:37.880
Or I could chose none of them -&gt; É¸

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:41.000
Now one point that I want to make is that we don't just want to count.

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.660
But, we do want to count. So if we were to just count how many subsets there are,

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:48.460
then here is the argument that we can do.  I need to make 3 decisions.

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:52.400
Am going to put the element A in my subset, yes or no?

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:56.240
I am going to put my element B in the subset?

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:58.520
And I am gonna put my element C on the subset, yes or no?

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:00.980
So I got three decisions.  And if for example:

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:08.560
I say I don't want to put A in, and I do wanna put B in, and I do want to put C in.

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:13.380
Then, that is going to determine uniquely one of these; in this case it's B and C.

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.940
This is kind of a different point of view so,

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:20.220
if instead of trying to choose the whole subset we just ask each element,

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.180
"OK, are you in? Are you out? Are you in? Or are you out?"

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:26.220
Then each element has two options, right?
A has 2 options

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.320
B has 2 options, and C has 2 options.

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.780
And so, the number of possibilities is 2x2x2, which is 8.

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:39.800
This is true in general, that if I had a set of N elements, then each element has, "yes or no," "yes or no."

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.680
So I get 2^N possible subsets.

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:44.020
So that's kind of the plain combinatorial point of view.

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:47.320
But now what I want to do, is talk about little bit about how we can model this geometrically,

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:51.980
and see if we learn a little bit more not just about the subsets, but, you know, how we gonna make sure we got them all?

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:55.020
How they are related to each other?
And so on. Before we go into this one,

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.120
let's go into a smaller example
where it is a little bit easier to draw.

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:00.200
We're actually going to start at the set of 1 element--

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.420
Actually, just start with a set of 0 element.

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:06.180
So we have 1 subset because we only have 1 option which is to not do anything.

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.220
This is going to be my subset right here. This dot is going to be very important.

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.380
I know it doesn't look important, but you'll see it is important.

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:16.140
So now let's move to 1 element, and let's call it A.

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:21.960
So now our subsets are... well, we have two options. You either, "don't chose A," or you, "do chose A."

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:26.220
And so what I want to do now, is that I want to represent them like this.

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:30.720
This is where I, "don't chose A," and this is where I, "do choose A."

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:32.780
Bear with me, I am just going to draw a line between them.

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.800
For the 0 element case... so what I'm trying to do is to draw a picture,

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.220
where every dot corresponds to every subset.

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:41.400
And then we'll talk about the connections between them,

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.160
so that we know how they are really related to each other.

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.720
So to do the next one, where we have two elements.  Let's say they're A and B.

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:50.620
I'm actually kind of getting tired of listing these subsets in on a line.

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:54.400
And I want to convince you that actually these subsets don't want to be on the line.

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.740
Does not... that's not really the shape they wanna make. They wanna make a different shape.

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:02.080
So I will try to convince you of that!  Let's start with the subset that we have before, OK.

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:05.640
And one thing you'll notice that these are still subsets of my set.

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:09.760
The empty set is the subset of {A,B}. A is the subset of {A,B}.

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:13.620
But now there's some new subsets, which I'm going to put right here.

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:17.200
When I add a green line, that means then I take a subset and then I add B to it.

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.480
Let's do the green marker. I add B to my set, so I get AB.

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:24.180
And now my red marker is still going to mean that I add A.

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:27.560
So if I take B and I add A to it, I get AB.

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:31.280
Really I would argue that actually this is the shape that these subsets want to be in.

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:35.840
Let's do the next one. Lets try to do the same thing we did here, but now let's use a different order.

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:43.080
So if I have three elements A, B, and C, we get the same picture that I have here, because each one of these is still a subset of ABC,

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:46.660
and it's still connected in the same way; red means add A, green means add B.

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:48.080
You see what we are missing, right?

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:49.920
BRADY HARAN: You're missing C.
FEDERICO ARDILA: We're missing C?

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:52.560
We need... we need to get C involved. C is not playing any role.

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.460
And I think I need a new color to put C in there.

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:00.280
So, if I go like this, that's going to mean I add C.

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:04.560
And of course I can do it for each one of these, and I'm going to get these new sets.

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:07.340
In this case I get AC.

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:09.800
In this case I get BC.

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:11.960
In this case I get ABC.

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:17.100
And this can follow the connections as before. So I use red to add A, I use red to add A,

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:21.380
And then with my green marker that means add B.  You know what we get?

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:22.760
BRADY HARAN: You made a cube!

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:27.240
FEDERICO ARDILA: And so this is the thing. The subsets... I mean okay here when we... when we did this,

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:31.600
we listed them all, and we... you know, it's a fine list. It's complete.

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:35.060
But we totally missed an aspect that is very important, which is that actually,

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:39.200
these things don't want to be sitting in a line, they want to be sitting in a cube.

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:43.420
We count them by listing them and going, "1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8."

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:47.400
And usually when we think about counting, kind of in everyday life,

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:51.700
we think of laying things in a row, and going, "1, 2, 3," and so on.

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:55.640
But if you look at this other method that we used, this is a very different kind of method,

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:59.180
where we actually were using the internal structure of these objects,

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:02.600
and let's try and let's think/see why it's 2 times 2 times 2.

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:09.140
Really what we're saying, in this argument is that: every time I add a new element to my set, the number of subsets doubles.

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:11.880
And this is something that becomes very clear visually.

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:14.980
Where I had one element, then I projected, and the number doubles.

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:18.660
Then I take these subsets, and now they double to become 4.

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:21.320
And these 4; they doubled to become 8.

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:26.120
And so now you see a pictorial representation of why these are doubling each time.

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:31.560
And then not only have we counted them, but we really have understood what is the kind of universal substance, and what that looks like.

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:36.240
The first time that I saw this, it was so clever.  And so beautiful. And now when I think of the subsets,

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:39.480
I just think of a cube.  And that's what I'm used to.  I've been doing it for many years.

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:41.020
And this is the image in my head now.

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:45.500
You know, we walk around the world and then I see a table, and then I think, "well, the table..." it took humanity

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:47.360
many generations to figure out, that.. you know,

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:49.940
that tables are made of molecules, and the molecules are made of atoms.

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:52.540
Depending on what atom it is, or what the material is made of,

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:55.680
then you know is maybe more flexible... it's flexible, stronger or weaker.

00:05:55.680 --> 00:06:00.140
BRADY HARAN: Okay, I'm going to give you nineteen elements, you know, in a set.

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:02.920
Tell me how many combinations there are.

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:08.100
You wouldn't sit there, in your head, and start creating this nineteen-dimensional object though.

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:10.100
You would... you would come... you would use this.

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:13.560
FEDERICO ARDILA: So, right. So, if I wanted to know the subsets of 19 are,

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:16.940
I definitely wouldn't use use this method of trying to list all of them.

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:22.440
Because, you know, that would take me impossibly long.  When I think I'm done, I'm not sure I'm going to be sure if I'm done.

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:30.300
So really, the way that I would do it is just, you know... here I have a method for understanding why the number of subsets of 19 elements is 2x2x2 19 times,

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:32.600
And then it's 2^19.  And then I figure out what that is.

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:39.680
I think more that what I would say is this geometric model is really a more detailed explanation for why this multiplicative formula holds.

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:44.500
BRADY HARAN: And since Mathematicians starting using this kind of technique, your way of thinking,

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:49.140
have they made new discoveries or reached new understandings because they see it this way?

00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:51.100
FEDERICO ARDILA: That's a... that's a really great question.

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:55.880
And maybe what I will answer to that is... you know, let's... let's look at these pictures.

00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:59.080
And... and let me follow exactly the question that you made earlier.

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:03.400
So here's 0 elements, 1 element, here's 2 elements, here's 3 elements.

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:08.060
And this doesn't stop here.  It's... it's clear that I could keep doing this for any number of elements.

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:11.980
I think what we should be asking ourselves is what kind of realm I working into now?

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:14.480
For example, you see this and you immediately call it a cube.

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:17.520
How many dimensions to a cube have?  We are used to saying that a cube is a 3 dimensional object.

00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:22.000
If I look at the subsets of a 2 element set, then they form a square.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.920
And... and a square is a 2 dimensional shape.

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:29.300
If I look at the subsets of a 1 element set, it's a line segment, and that's a 1 dimensional shape.

00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:34.760
We're not used to talking about 0 dimensions, but... but a dot is a 0 dimensional shape.

00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:40.200
And so here I'm going 0 dimensions, 1 dimension, 2 dimensions, 3 dimensions.

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:43.820
And then, this really shows me that the 4th dimension is going to appear very naturally here.

00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:46.980
And I might be thinking here that I'm scared of 4 dimensions.

00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:50.020
I might be thinking that I don't know how this goes.

00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:53.080
But I can certainly just do the next step, and I think we should.

00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:55.560
And we should find out what a 4 dimensional polytope looks like.

00:07:56.320 --> 00:08:00.700
Let's say that I have now, the 4 element set.

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:03.840
And let's try to figure out, what are the subsets here?

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.120
So now what I am going to do is the same procedure that we did before.

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:10.800
I am going to want to add Ds.  And so basically I am going to have to give this a new direction.

00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:15.000
This picture is going to now kind of move over here, and include Ds also.

00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:19.140
And before we do that I think we should go back and see... and just look at what happened over here.

00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:24.200
Here we had the subsets of 0 elements.  So this was 0 dimensional.

00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:28.040
And now to move from here to here, we basically had 2 copies of this... of this picture.

00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:31.200
One of them is here, one of them is here.  And we connected it with an edge.

00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:33.020
So we added a new direction, OK?

00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:38.400
Now when we move in this direction, we basically are taking 2 copies of this one.

00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:42.720
There's this copy, and this copy.  And now we are adding a new dimension.

00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:45.960
So now this is a line, and it becomes a 2 dimensional square.

00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:52.080
Now here, I have a square.  And now I really want to think that this is 3 dimensional,

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:55.580
in the sense that we are taking a square, and I am protruding it to a 3rd dimension.

00:08:55.720 --> 00:09:01.600
So I am really taking a 2 dimensional picture, and I'm taking the bottom and top square, and connecting to make it a 3 dimensional picture.

00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:04.080
And so that's the visualization that we want to think of here.

00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:06.480
I have a now 3 dimensional thing, and it's... it's a cube.

00:09:07.020 --> 00:09:09.560
And, this is the part that's going to be a little hard to imagine.

00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:12.660
But, we are going to want to move it into the 4th dimension.

00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:17.700
By taking a 3 dimensional cube here, a 3 dimensional cube some parallel universe, and connect them with a line.

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:20.900
So, I don't know about this parallel universe.  I don't know what that looks like.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:22.920
But I know how to draw another cube and make the connections.

00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:23.600
In fact I'm going to...

00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:30.880
We're going to make a 4th dimension.  We're going to add a new direction telling me to add the Element D.

00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:35.360
It's going to look like... this.

00:09:37.180 --> 00:09:38.460
And this is green.

00:09:40.540 --> 00:09:43.740
And this is red.

00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:44.700
OK.

00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:48.120
BRADY HARAN: That's a monster.

00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:49.640
FEDERICO ARDILA:  So that's... that's it.

00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:57.200
So, this picture right here... is... you know, for one, is the illustration of subsets of a 4 elements set.

00:09:57.500 --> 00:09:58.940
And we can see that there's 16 of them.

00:09:58.940 --> 00:10:02.440
It also is maybe the first time you have seen a 4 dimensional shape.

00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:04.100
This is a 4 dimensional figure.

00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:10.080
Now, of course this is drawn on a piece of paper, so this is like the 2 dimensional shadow of a 4 dimensional object.

00:10:10.340 --> 00:10:15.280
But then you can see, for example, how... for example in a 3 dimensional cube.

00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:18.460
You can see that there's a lot of squares, right?

00:10:18.460 --> 00:10:20.400
A 3 dimensional cube has 6 squares.

00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:23.680
Corresponding to the 6 times that you get shapes like this.

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:29.320
If you look at this one carefully, we started by drawing one and two 2 dimensional cubes.

00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:32.320
But if you look more carefully, you are going to find that there's many other cubes.

00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:35.540
For example, here's another one with these two squares.

00:10:35.540 --> 00:10:37.420
Here's another one with these two squares.

00:10:37.540 --> 00:10:40.260
And really there's a bunch of different cubes that are living together.

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:43.240
And so then you start to see there's a lot of inherent structure here,

00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:45.940
where there's you know, in this case, the 4 dimensional shape,

00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:50.960
and then there's all these 3 dimensional pieces, and 2 dimensional pieces, which fit together into this... this nice shape.

00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:53.520
This is exactly what geometrical combinatorics is about.

00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:57.960
It's about kind of drawing the connections between geometry.  And it's often geometry in very high dimensions.

00:10:58.220 --> 00:11:01.640
And noticing that there's actually a lot of discrete structure behind there.

00:11:01.660 --> 00:11:04.280
So for example, if you know about the regular solids.

00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:06.640
Then, you know that there's the 3 dimensional regular solids.

00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:09.580
And there's a few 4 dimensional, 5 dimensional, and so on.

00:11:09.580 --> 00:11:11.220
They have a very rigid combinatorial structure.

00:11:11.220 --> 00:11:12.660
And if you really want to understand those,

00:11:12.660 --> 00:11:16.140
you also have to get into what is the combinatorics behind what is those discrete structures.

00:11:16.140 --> 00:11:21.060
There's this beautiful dictionary that really teaches you about... both about these very old questions of,

00:11:21.060 --> 00:11:24.620
"how do you count the subsets of a set?"  Something as basic as that.

00:11:24.620 --> 00:11:30.600
But then if you really just take that idea further, you end up finding... just landing into 4 dimensional space,

00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:32.980
And figuring out how... how to walk around in that space.

00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:35.700
BRADY HARAN: Are you going to draw a 5 dimensional one for us?

00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:38.660
FEDERICO ARDILA: No. (laughs)

00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:44.940
But I... you know I know, say I definitely would invite the viewers... with grid paper.

00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:47.400
Which is what... you know it's tricky to this without grid paper.

00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:49.680
But... but with grid paper, it's actually pretty simple to do.

00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:53.820
You do... you take this shape, and you draw it, you know, you take it, you shift it over, and you make connections.

00:11:53.820 --> 00:11:55.140
And that's the 5 dimensional shape.

00:11:55.140 --> 00:11:58.500
And if you really have a lot of time on your hands, you could draw your 19 dimensional shape.

00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:02.580
By taking it and protruding it, protruding it to 5, to 6, to 7, and so on.

00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:23.840
Oh, we have got something very interesting.

00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:25.120
Have we?

00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:27.120
Yes.  Look at this.  We have--
