&gt;&gt; Suzanne Schadl: My
name is Suzanne Schadl,

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:17.780
I am the new chief in the
Hispanic division here

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:19.080
in the Library of Congress.

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.500
I'd like to welcome the audience
and thank you for coming.

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:27.440
I would like to say just
real quickly a few words

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:32.640
about the Hispanic division and
about Talia Guzman-Ganzalez,

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.020
who has organized today's event.

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:38.420
So, does everybody here know
about the Hispanic division

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:40.880
and what we do for
the most part?

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:42.180
So, I'll just reiterate.

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.610
I think one of the most
-- this is from me --

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.590
I think one of the most
important things that we do is

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:51.750
that we provide people who
help people and you can see

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.030
when we're talking
about corrections

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.790
that we have corrections
in many different parts

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:58.970
of the Library of Congress.

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:01.350
So, here today you
have rare books,

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.750
you have general collection,
you have prints and photographs.

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:07.610
And they all deal with
some extent with the topic

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:10.880
of our presentation today
and that's brought together

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:15.000
by Talia, who has also
brought in community members

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.230
and academics who are
experts in this field.

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:21.520
So, one of the most important
contributions we can make is

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:25.020
to bring resources and
people and discussions

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.230
about those resources
and topics together.

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:31.720
And I'm very grateful to
Talia and many others of you

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:36.140
in the room to do that kind of
work, so I'm going to turn it

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.260
over to her so she can
introduce our speaker.

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.560
And thank you.

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.650
&gt;&gt; TALIA GUZMAN-GONZALEZ:

focusing on the efforts

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:20.800
to integrate the two
distinctly tried traditions

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:22.100
of Latin America.

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:23.410
I would also like to add

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:25.390
that Thayse has been here
several times to work

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:29.160
on her book and I look forward

and Portuguese Literary
and Cultural Studies.

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:45.380
Please join me in
welcoming Thayse

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:47.510
and Patricia to this
presentation.

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:55.390
[ Applause ]

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:57.260
&gt;&gt; Patricia Vieira: Well,
good afternoon, everyone.

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:02.760
I'd like to first of all
thank Dr. Talia Guzman

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:06.500
and the Hispanic division for
the opportunity to be here

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:10.430
and to talk to you a bit
about my most recent book.

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:14.680
And to thank Dr. Thayse Lina for
accepting to moderate the debate

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:18.880
and to talk a bit about
the book later on.

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:20.800
And I would like to
start with a few words

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:22.600
about the Brazilian elections.

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:26.240
Those of you who are even
a bit interested in Brazil,

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:28.270
probably have followed
the elections

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:32.570
that took place this last Sunday
and I think in the context

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:35.990
of those elections it becomes
more important than ever

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:41.470
to reflect upon utopia
and the two candidates

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:45.660
who will face each other in the
second round of the elections

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:47.820
at the end of the mouth.

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:51.590
Jair Balsonaro and Fernando
Haddad, they both, of course,

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:56.110
presents two almost
diametrically opposed views

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:57.410
of Brazil.

00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:00.440
One a very nationalistic
and tradition

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:04.680
and even authoritarian
vision of the country

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:08.260
and the other one
the dream of a kind

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:11.040
of a more egalitarian Brazil
that would be more open

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:13.780
to external influences.

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:16.970
That I would argue that both
candidates go back to some

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:21.610
of the utopian themes that have
shaped the history of Brazil

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:25.600
and Brazilian thought
throughout the centuries.

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:31.200
And just as an example,
Balsonaro draws heavily

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:35.410
on the messianic tradition
that I discuss in the book.

00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:37.180
I don't know if all of you know,

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:40.450
but his middle name is actually
the Portuguese for Messiah,

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:46.590
[inaudible], and he often
presents himself as this savior

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:51.300
who is going to come and lead
the country to a golden age

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:56.120
of security and of stability,
even if this comes at the cost

00:06:56.120 --> 00:07:01.570
of embracing past racial
and gender hierarchies.

00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:05.200
And, of course, of cementing
some of the economic disparities

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:07.460
that have plagued Brazil.

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:12.830
Haddad's platform on the other
hand goes back to the promise

00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:18.240
of social political and economic
justice that has been one

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:21.740
of the key tenants of
one Brazilian utopianism

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:24.550
as I discussed in the book.

00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:28.330
And, so, even though they
are both very different,

00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:33.790
both of these candidates go
back to utopian ideas of Brazil

00:07:33.790 --> 00:07:37.120
that I think we need to
really analyze in order

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:41.320
to understand what is going
on today in the country.

00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:46.450
So, the idea to write this
book, I rose precisely

00:07:46.450 --> 00:07:51.260
from this reflection that Brazil
has throughout the centuries

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:55.620
been a repository for
Utopian aspirations.

00:07:55.620 --> 00:08:02.270
And so that was the goal of
my project, to kind of go back

00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:04.250
to these utopian aspirations

00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:08.620
that have shaped
what Brazil is today.

00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:13.660
An Example of this is
Thomas More's book, Utopia,

00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:18.940
and you have the copy of I
believe the first edition

00:08:18.940 --> 00:08:24.020
of Thomas More's
Utopia, from 1516.

00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:27.640
And in this book and in Thomas
More's utopia, of course,

00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:29.690
the word utopia was coined,

00:08:29.690 --> 00:08:35.660
right and in this book
Thomas More, British writer,

00:08:35.660 --> 00:08:41.160
he imagines an island
that would be more perfect

00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:44.160
than the England of his kind.

00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:47.550
And use of this island
supposedly was brought

00:08:47.550 --> 00:08:51.590
to Thomas More by a Portuguese
sailor called Raphael.

00:08:51.590 --> 00:08:53.790
And you can see here
he's alluding

00:08:53.790 --> 00:08:59.280
to the Portuguese voyages to
Africa, to Asia, and especially

00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:01.590
to the Americas, right?

00:09:01.590 --> 00:09:05.160
this is a map, of
course, fictional map

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:08.760
of the fictional island
of utopia from the end

00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:13.570
of the 16th century based
on Thomas More's book.

00:09:13.570 --> 00:09:21.440
So, More he never really
specified the coordinates

00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:24.050
of his imaginary
island of Utopia.

00:09:24.050 --> 00:09:26.870
But he did write that
it was located somewhere

00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:28.290
in the New World.

00:09:28.290 --> 00:09:31.880
And given that I was first
visited by a Portuguese sailor,

00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:36.010
we can imagine that maybe More
had the land that is now Brazil

00:09:36.010 --> 00:09:42.700
in mind when he wrote about
this island of Utopia, right.

00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:47.660
The Utopian drive became
part of Brazil's cultural

00:09:47.660 --> 00:09:50.870
and intellectual
DNA from the arrival

00:09:50.870 --> 00:09:53.980
from the first Portuguese
sailors and settlers onwards.

00:09:53.980 --> 00:09:59.350
The regions environment was
often compared to paradise,

00:09:59.350 --> 00:10:02.740
because it was so
lush and bountiful.

00:10:02.740 --> 00:10:08.620
And even Brazil's pre-Columbian
inhabitants were first regarded

00:10:08.620 --> 00:10:12.240
as very amicable and friendly.

00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:15.710
Of course, this then this
perception then changed

00:10:15.710 --> 00:10:18.150
as colonization progressed.

00:10:18.150 --> 00:10:20.030
But early Brazil was seen

00:10:20.030 --> 00:10:23.490
by European explorers
as utopia realized.

00:10:23.490 --> 00:10:26.300
This is a painting called,
The First Mass in Brazil,

00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:29.040
by a painter from
the romantic period.

00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:32.880
I think it's from
1861, this painting,

00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:34.830
and the painter is
Victor Meirelles.

00:10:34.830 --> 00:10:37.840
And you can see here some of
the things I'm talking about.

00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:41.420
So, the lush environment,
the large trees.

00:10:41.420 --> 00:10:43.880
You have, of course,
the religious element,

00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:46.150
you have the soldiers
also there.

00:10:46.150 --> 00:10:47.450
And then you have

00:10:47.450 --> 00:10:51.790
in the foreground the
native Brazilian population,

00:10:51.790 --> 00:10:54.340
which looks on, they
look on with interest

00:10:54.340 --> 00:10:57.090
and without any sort
of animosity

00:10:57.090 --> 00:11:01.360
at the colonizers, right?

00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:06.840
One of the most powerful
utopian forces

00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:10.080
that really led settlers --

00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:19.110
well, that led settlers to
establish themselves in Brazil

00:11:19.110 --> 00:11:25.870
in the beginning was, of course,
an economic reason, right?

00:11:25.870 --> 00:11:31.070
Brazil at first there
was lots of money made

00:11:31.070 --> 00:11:35.170
through the selling of sugar
produced in Brazil in Europe,

00:11:35.170 --> 00:11:41.460
so the cane plantations were
the first large scale economic

00:11:41.460 --> 00:11:42.830
practice in Brazil.

00:11:42.830 --> 00:11:49.110
Then there was the gold rush in
Brazil, which was another seen

00:11:49.110 --> 00:11:55.070
as an easy path to
enrichment, right, so, again,

00:11:55.070 --> 00:11:56.750
this utopian idea that if you go

00:11:56.750 --> 00:11:59.590
to Brazil you'll
get money easily

00:11:59.590 --> 00:12:01.290
and you'll get rich easily.

00:12:01.290 --> 00:12:04.170
This is a picture from the 1980s

00:12:04.170 --> 00:12:08.070
by Brazilian photographer,
Sebastiao Salgado.

00:12:08.070 --> 00:12:11.960
And, so mining continues
to be an important activity

00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:13.410
in Brazil to this day.

00:12:13.410 --> 00:12:17.810
This is in [inaudible], which is
in the southern part of Prada,

00:12:17.810 --> 00:12:20.260
so in the northern
area of Brazil.

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:24.290
And then another moment
where there was this idea

00:12:24.290 --> 00:12:28.460
of easy enrichment in Brazil
with the so called Rubber Boom

00:12:28.460 --> 00:12:33.500
in the Amazon in the late
19th, early 20th century,

00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:37.480
where the sale of
latex in Europe,

00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:40.300
because rubber was
needed to produce,

00:12:40.300 --> 00:12:44.430
among other things,
tires for cars.

00:12:44.430 --> 00:12:49.680
So, people extracted latex from
the rubber trees in the Amazon

00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:52.950
and that created
prodigious wealth

00:12:52.950 --> 00:12:55.860
in the Amazon reason, right?

00:12:55.860 --> 00:12:59.590
So, my point is that
various moments

00:12:59.590 --> 00:13:03.120
in its history Brazil was
seen of a kind of El Dorado,

00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:06.690
where you could just go
and get rich very easily

00:13:06.690 --> 00:13:09.470
without too much work.

00:13:09.470 --> 00:13:13.240
But, these economic
considerations I think do not

00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:18.850
exhaust the utopian
aura of Brazil.

00:13:18.850 --> 00:13:23.510
The idea that Brazil is an
economic El Dorado goes hand

00:13:23.510 --> 00:13:28.440
in hand with the idea that also
social politically Brazil can

00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:31.170
point the way to the future.

00:13:31.170 --> 00:13:35.650
There is an Austrian
author called Stefan Zweig,

00:13:35.650 --> 00:13:40.610
who titled his book from
the 1940s, Precisely Brazil,

00:13:40.610 --> 00:13:42.760
a Country of the Future.

00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:46.390
And in this book, which
we also have therefore you

00:13:46.390 --> 00:13:52.520
to see afterwards, he contrasts
the racism that was prevalent

00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:55.670
in Europe at the time he was
writing during the Second

00:13:55.670 --> 00:13:56.970
World War.

00:13:56.970 --> 00:13:59.470
And so he contrasts
the situation in Europe

00:13:59.470 --> 00:14:07.390
that was engulfed in racial
bigotry with the situation

00:14:07.390 --> 00:14:13.330
in Brazil that he sees as the
prototype for human relations

00:14:13.330 --> 00:14:15.220
in the rest of the globe.

00:14:15.220 --> 00:14:18.310
Of course, he might have
a somewhat rosy picture

00:14:18.310 --> 00:14:23.680
of what Brazil was, but he
believed that the country

00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:27.460
and this is a quote from his
book, "Is destined to become one

00:14:27.460 --> 00:14:29.260
of the most important factors

00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:32.490
in the future development
of our world."

00:14:32.490 --> 00:14:35.760
And he continues by
writing about Brazil,

00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:40.010
"I knew that I had glimpsed
the future of our world."

00:14:40.010 --> 00:14:43.660
And he says, "Brazil gave me the
feeling of living in a process

00:14:43.660 --> 00:14:47.950
of becoming, in what is
to come, in the future."

00:14:47.950 --> 00:14:51.620
And, so, this idea of Brazil as
being a country of the future

00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:57.720
that points the way to how our
future might look like remains

00:14:57.720 --> 00:15:00.540
to this day and I think
became very much a part

00:15:00.540 --> 00:15:02.880
of the country's identity.

00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:07.150
To this day Brazilian
politicians, economists,

00:15:07.150 --> 00:15:10.310
scholars and so on, speculate

00:15:10.310 --> 00:15:13.200
about whether the country
will be able to live

00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:17.080
up to its promise of being a
country of the future enough

00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:24.180
and this is very much at play
also in the electoral race

00:15:24.180 --> 00:15:28.340
in the rhetoric of
both candidates.

00:15:28.340 --> 00:15:33.170
So, In States of Grace, in this
book that I have just published,

00:15:33.170 --> 00:15:39.860
I traced how this idea of Brazil
as a utopian land was reworked

00:15:39.860 --> 00:15:42.760
by Brazilian intellectuals
at various moments

00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:44.880
in the country's history.

00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:49.620
And my first step was where
the messianic writings

00:15:49.620 --> 00:15:54.070
of Jesuit priest, Antonio
Vieira, whom you can see here,

00:15:54.070 --> 00:15:59.090
are preaching to Brazilian
Indians, pointing, of course,

00:15:59.090 --> 00:16:03.160
to heaven, right, which is --
it's very interesting that,

00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:05.700
of course, the indigenous
population is seen as close

00:16:05.700 --> 00:16:09.630
to the ground and they have
to somehow rise up spiritually

00:16:09.630 --> 00:16:13.640
in the direction
of heaven, right?

00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:19.260
So, this was my first step in
the book and the utopian moment

00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:24.150
in his writings is that he
believes that the colonization

00:16:24.150 --> 00:16:27.370
of Brazil was the first
-- not the colonization,

00:16:27.370 --> 00:16:29.660
the colonization and
the evangelization

00:16:29.660 --> 00:16:32.660
or the Christianization
of Brazil was going

00:16:32.660 --> 00:16:34.570
to be the first step

00:16:34.570 --> 00:16:37.670
of Christianization
of the entire world.

00:16:37.670 --> 00:16:40.700
And this conversion
of the entire world

00:16:40.700 --> 00:16:45.290
to Catholicism would herald
the second coming of Christ,

00:16:45.290 --> 00:16:48.080
who would establish
a millenarian kingdom

00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:49.380
of peace on Earth.

00:16:49.380 --> 00:16:55.420
So, you can see the utopian
undertones of his thought here.

00:16:55.420 --> 00:16:58.950
Another moment I explored in
the book was the perception

00:16:58.950 --> 00:17:03.470
of the Amazon and you have
here a beautiful image

00:17:03.470 --> 00:17:07.160
of the Amazon during
the time of the flood

00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:11.100
when the river is
very full, right?

00:17:11.100 --> 00:17:16.130
So, the Amazon has also been
perceived as a utopian space,

00:17:16.130 --> 00:17:20.730
both by Brazilians and by
foreign explorers who project

00:17:20.730 --> 00:17:28.200
onto the Amazon their ideas of
social and political justice.

00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:32.190
I also discussed in the
book the close relationship

00:17:32.190 --> 00:17:35.610
between Brazilian culture
and the environment

00:17:35.610 --> 00:17:38.430
as a source of utopianism.

00:17:38.430 --> 00:17:42.400
Brazil, as you all know,
is rightly so associated

00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:46.730
to biodiversity and Brazilian
writers have often imagined

00:17:46.730 --> 00:17:50.620
alternative relationships
to animals and plants

00:17:50.620 --> 00:17:54.360
that would not be predicated
on just exploitation.

00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:57.240
And then a final
topic I discussed

00:17:57.240 --> 00:18:00.340
in the book was the
conception of Brazil

00:18:00.340 --> 00:18:02.810
as a society of leisure.

00:18:02.810 --> 00:18:07.240
And while colonizers often
criticized the work ethics

00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:11.550
of native Brazilians, Brazilian
intellectuals have come

00:18:11.550 --> 00:18:15.220
to imagine leisure
and even laziness

00:18:15.220 --> 00:18:19.690
as a positive Brazilian trait
that distinguishes Brazil

00:18:19.690 --> 00:18:24.980
from other countries in
Europe and in North America.

00:18:24.980 --> 00:18:29.290
And according to this view of
Brazil, the country's laziness

00:18:29.290 --> 00:18:33.240
or leisurely way of life,
heralds a future time

00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:36.910
when machines will do all
the work and we will be able

00:18:36.910 --> 00:18:42.910
to devote ourselves to
leisurely pursuits, such as,

00:18:42.910 --> 00:18:45.850
for instance, artistic pursuits.

00:18:45.850 --> 00:18:53.920
Right? This is a clip from a
1969 film titled Macunaima,

00:18:53.920 --> 00:18:57.760
by Joaquim Pedro de
Andrade, and Macunaima,

00:18:57.760 --> 00:19:02.030
who is said to be the hero of
Brazil, the hero of our people,

00:19:02.030 --> 00:19:08.380
as it is said in the book, he
was defined by his laziness,

00:19:08.380 --> 00:19:11.400
he was extremely lazy,
didn't like to work at all.

00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:15.080
And here you see him
lying in a hammock

00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:18.660
where he spends a lot of time.

00:19:18.660 --> 00:19:24.320
And the film is in and of itself
a rework of a novel published

00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:28.560
in 1928 by Mario de
Adnrade, modernist writer.

00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:30.410
Also called Macunaima.

00:19:30.410 --> 00:19:34.480
And also in the novel
Macunaima is extremely lazy

00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:38.110
and has his brothers
do most of the work.

00:19:38.110 --> 00:19:40.900
And this is again seen
as something positive,

00:19:40.900 --> 00:19:43.300
so it's not criticized
in the book.

00:19:43.300 --> 00:19:46.900
It's seen as a positive
trait and it's almost

00:19:46.900 --> 00:19:52.360
as if Brazilian intellectuals
were embracing a criticism

00:19:52.360 --> 00:19:55.030
that is also often leveled
against Brazilians, right,

00:19:55.030 --> 00:19:57.840
that Brazilians are lazy, they
don't like doing too much work.

00:19:57.840 --> 00:20:01.030
And, so, these intellectuals
were saying, yes,

00:20:01.030 --> 00:20:05.240
but this is a good thing
that we resist doing work

00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:06.980
that in fact leads nowhere.

00:20:06.980 --> 00:20:10.540
Right, so, this is another
moment of utopianism

00:20:10.540 --> 00:20:14.120
that I explored in the book.

00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:17.910
So, positing Brazil as
this country of the future,

00:20:17.910 --> 00:20:25.910
as some of these utopias
do, creates a kind of a gap

00:20:25.910 --> 00:20:29.840
between Brazil's present
reality as a country

00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:33.040
that has a certain
set of limitations

00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:38.050
and the utopian expectations
that we place up on Brazil.

00:20:38.050 --> 00:20:42.080
And this so called, we could
call it even a cognizant

00:20:42.080 --> 00:20:46.610
dissonance between reality as
it is and reality as we would

00:20:46.610 --> 00:20:54.930
like it to be creates a problem
that Brazilians respond to,

00:20:54.930 --> 00:20:58.150
I would think, in
two different ways.

00:20:58.150 --> 00:21:02.710
On the one hand the
significance of utopia

00:21:02.710 --> 00:21:06.130
for Brazilian identity
contributes

00:21:06.130 --> 00:21:09.510
to what has been called
oofanista [phonetic

00:21:09.510 --> 00:21:10.810
spelling] attitude.

00:21:10.810 --> 00:21:15.390
Oofanista means just proud
or self-congratulatory.

00:21:15.390 --> 00:21:19.990
And, so, often in -- if
you espouse this attitude,

00:21:19.990 --> 00:21:24.440
you tend to disregard Brazil's
problems and to believe

00:21:24.440 --> 00:21:28.240
that Brazil is the
greatest nation on Earth,

00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:32.990
surpassing even the wildest
utopian expectations.

00:21:32.990 --> 00:21:36.030
This is the main
argument of a book titled,

00:21:36.030 --> 00:21:38.360
Why I Am Proud of My Country.

00:21:38.360 --> 00:21:42.550
In Portuguese, [speaking foreign
language], published in 1900.

00:21:42.550 --> 00:21:46.740
And in this book
by Alfonso Selsu,

00:21:46.740 --> 00:21:50.600
the author really just
lavishes praise on Brazil

00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:53.680
as the greatest country
on Earth and it says

00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:58.010
if Brazil is really
utopia realized.

00:21:58.010 --> 00:22:03.020
And this mindset has
resurfaced at several moments

00:22:03.020 --> 00:22:05.540
in Brazil's cultural history.

00:22:05.540 --> 00:22:08.870
For instance, during the
period of modernismo,

00:22:08.870 --> 00:22:13.330
which I already modernism,
which I already talked about.

00:22:13.330 --> 00:22:16.620
Some of the factions that
emerged during this period,

00:22:16.620 --> 00:22:23.230
they really had a radically
nationalistic oofanista agenda

00:22:23.230 --> 00:22:27.880
that advocated the
superiority of Brazilian values

00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:31.720
and of the Brazilian way
of being in the world.

00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:35.510
This segment of modernism
was associated

00:22:35.510 --> 00:22:39.620
with far right political
movements, such as integralism

00:22:39.620 --> 00:22:40.920
and this is a picture

00:22:40.920 --> 00:22:45.000
of Brazilian integralists
demonstrating.

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:50.370
And then some of these values
of integralism then fed

00:22:50.370 --> 00:22:51.890
into the nationalism

00:22:51.890 --> 00:22:53.570
of [inaudible] totalitarian
new states

00:22:53.570 --> 00:22:59.770
in the late 1930s and 1940s.

00:22:59.770 --> 00:23:03.570
And, again, the military
dictatorship that ruled Brazil

00:23:03.570 --> 00:23:09.700
between '64 and '85 went back
to some of the oofanista values,

00:23:09.700 --> 00:23:13.290
singing the glory of
the Brazilian nation.

00:23:13.290 --> 00:23:19.520
And I would argue to a certain
extent current candidate

00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:23.530
for Brazilian presidency,
[inaudible] also goes back

00:23:23.530 --> 00:23:25.780
to some of these ideas

00:23:25.780 --> 00:23:28.780
of oofanismal [phonetic
spelling] praising a certain

00:23:28.780 --> 00:23:34.760
version of what Brazil
is as opposed to --

00:23:34.760 --> 00:23:39.840
as opposed to a more,
let's say, horizontal view

00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:43.000
of what the country could be.

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:49.350
So, I'm not saying that
nationalism and allegiance

00:23:49.350 --> 00:23:53.930
to one's country is
necessarily something negative,

00:23:53.930 --> 00:23:59.260
but this excessively
nationalistic oofanista attitude

00:23:59.260 --> 00:24:04.700
often entails a racist posture
and it's ultranationalism

00:24:04.700 --> 00:24:08.900
and it's exaltation of
Brazilianess often goes hand

00:24:08.900 --> 00:24:10.200
and hand with the --

00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:12.950
at the debasement of other
nations and cultures.

00:24:12.950 --> 00:24:16.760
And even with certain groups
within the Brazilian nations,

00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:18.860
such as afro Brazilians.

00:24:18.860 --> 00:24:20.610
All right.

00:24:20.610 --> 00:24:24.300
So, this is one of the paths

00:24:24.300 --> 00:24:26.780
that utopia can follow
in Brazil.

00:24:26.780 --> 00:24:30.860
So, this cognitive dissonance
between the way things are

00:24:30.860 --> 00:24:35.530
and the way things could be
can lead to this overtly --

00:24:35.530 --> 00:24:38.160
over nationalistic attitude.

00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:42.480
The other attitude it can
produce, this disparity

00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:45.080
between how things are
and how we would like them

00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:51.370
to be is an excessively critical
and even fatalistic view

00:24:51.370 --> 00:24:56.050
of Brazil, according to which
Brazil permanently falls short

00:24:56.050 --> 00:24:58.370
of one's expectations, right?

00:24:58.370 --> 00:25:01.970
at the very mundane level
in Brazil and those of you

00:25:01.970 --> 00:25:03.780
who know a bit about Brazil,

00:25:03.780 --> 00:25:07.410
remember that Brazilians keep
referring to the exterior,

00:25:07.410 --> 00:25:09.770
to the countries
that are outside

00:25:09.770 --> 00:25:11.970
as if they were much
better than Brazil.

00:25:11.970 --> 00:25:14.790
And, so, Brazil always
compares negatively

00:25:14.790 --> 00:25:17.670
to other countries, right?

00:25:17.670 --> 00:25:22.400
And the root of this
self-debasement lies

00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:27.300
in an interpretation of
Brazil as plagued by a kind

00:25:27.300 --> 00:25:29.430
of fundamental deficiency,

00:25:29.430 --> 00:25:32.440
and this deficiency
has been identified

00:25:32.440 --> 00:25:35.200
by different intellectuals
differently.

00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:41.080
It can be racism, it can
be the profound inequality

00:25:41.080 --> 00:25:45.140
that plagues the country, it
can be corruption, for instance,

00:25:45.140 --> 00:25:48.300
I have a cartoon that says,

00:25:48.300 --> 00:25:51.270
"Either Brazil finishes
corrupt people

00:25:51.270 --> 00:25:53.300
or corrupt people
will finish Brazil."

00:25:53.300 --> 00:25:57.760
And, so, you have all of
the corrupt people eating,

00:25:57.760 --> 00:25:59.890
eating away at Brazil.

00:25:59.890 --> 00:26:07.510
And again, corruption was a key
issue in this Sunday's election

00:26:07.510 --> 00:26:13.410
and will be a key issue in the
second round as well, right?

00:26:13.410 --> 00:26:16.570
So, [inaudible] is justified,
of course, in identifying --

00:26:16.570 --> 00:26:19.270
in identifying the
shortcomings of Brazil

00:26:19.270 --> 00:26:21.960
or of any other country.

00:26:21.960 --> 00:26:26.740
Many of these shortcomings that
Brazilian intellectuals identify

00:26:26.740 --> 00:26:30.100
as a shortcoming
of their country,

00:26:30.100 --> 00:26:32.520
they're not problems
of Brazil alone.

00:26:32.520 --> 00:26:36.080
I mean, they exist in most
countries in the world.

00:26:36.080 --> 00:26:40.200
And, so, I would argue that they
do not warrant this permanent

00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:44.970
feeling of inadequacy
of Brazil when compared

00:26:44.970 --> 00:26:48.400
to its utopian potential.

00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:52.690
Nor do they condemn Brazil
to somehow lag behind

00:26:52.690 --> 00:26:57.160
and not be a better
version of itself, right?

00:26:57.160 --> 00:27:01.860
And as we know this critical
impulse was part of utopia

00:27:01.860 --> 00:27:05.330
from the beginning, that's why
Thomas More wrote his book,

00:27:05.330 --> 00:27:09.870
Utopia, was to criticize
the England of his time

00:27:09.870 --> 00:27:14.100
and to show how it could
be a better country.

00:27:14.100 --> 00:27:19.820
So, to conclude and then I would
like to hear a bit from you,

00:27:19.820 --> 00:27:23.750
but to conclude, In States
of Grace I tried to showed

00:27:23.750 --> 00:27:28.170
that utopia determines Brazilian
history from the beginning

00:27:28.170 --> 00:27:32.380
and it is and will probably
remain a central element

00:27:32.380 --> 00:27:35.430
in Brazil's collective identity.

00:27:35.430 --> 00:27:39.180
And, as I was discussing
just now, the very nature

00:27:39.180 --> 00:27:43.110
of utopia is to create
this gap between what is

00:27:43.110 --> 00:27:46.250
and what could be,
between reality

00:27:46.250 --> 00:27:49.300
and a better version of reality.

00:27:49.300 --> 00:27:54.220
And Brazilian intellectuals
have responded to this tension

00:27:54.220 --> 00:27:57.080
that is part of utopianism
by hovering

00:27:57.080 --> 00:28:01.910
between the two extremes
of exalted nationalism

00:28:01.910 --> 00:28:06.040
and excessive criticism
of their country.

00:28:06.040 --> 00:28:10.530
And I think that by giving in
to either of these tendencies,

00:28:10.530 --> 00:28:14.670
Brazil risk is never
really embracing the present

00:28:14.670 --> 00:28:18.980
and never really fulfilling
its utopian potential.

00:28:18.980 --> 00:28:22.660
I think these two tendencies,
this excessive nationalism

00:28:22.660 --> 00:28:28.780
and this fatalistic criticism
are easy responses to utopianism

00:28:28.780 --> 00:28:33.250
that fail to meet the
challenge of utopia.

00:28:33.250 --> 00:28:36.710
Because in one way or the
other they end up subscribing

00:28:36.710 --> 00:28:38.410
to the current state of affairs.

00:28:38.410 --> 00:28:40.410
Either because it's
already great

00:28:40.410 --> 00:28:42.300
or because it cannot be changed.

00:28:42.300 --> 00:28:45.630
Right? So, both of
these tendencies lead us

00:28:45.630 --> 00:28:49.580
to stay the way we are,
so they do not prompt us

00:28:49.580 --> 00:28:52.070
to change anything.

00:28:52.070 --> 00:28:55.740
So, I think that Brazil
should reject these two paths

00:28:55.740 --> 00:29:00.540
of excessive nationalism or
excessive criticism and continue

00:29:00.540 --> 00:29:04.850
to be open to the utopian
possibilities that are woven

00:29:04.850 --> 00:29:09.260
into the very fabric of
the nation's culture.

00:29:09.260 --> 00:29:14.670
As Brazilians prepare to vote
in the second round of elections

00:29:14.670 --> 00:29:18.860
in the end of October, I hope
that they will steer clear

00:29:18.860 --> 00:29:23.380
of both this over
nationalistic attitudes and also

00:29:23.380 --> 00:29:28.320
of a defeatist stance that only
foregrounds the negative aspects

00:29:28.320 --> 00:29:30.160
in Brazilian culture.

00:29:30.160 --> 00:29:33.460
The ultra conservative
rights represented

00:29:33.460 --> 00:29:36.650
by Jai Balsonaro I
think has been able

00:29:36.650 --> 00:29:39.130
to capitalize very well both

00:29:39.130 --> 00:29:43.750
on the extreme nationalist
oofanista sentiment

00:29:43.750 --> 00:29:48.570
and on a defeatist outlook of
an elector that is really tired

00:29:48.570 --> 00:29:51.110
of corruption scandals
and the social violence.

00:29:51.110 --> 00:29:55.490
So, Balsonaro has been, I think,
very savvy in capitalizing

00:29:55.490 --> 00:29:57.100
on both of these attitudes.

00:29:57.100 --> 00:30:00.360
He, of course, always presents
himself with a background

00:30:00.360 --> 00:30:03.660
of the Brazilian
national flag or dressed

00:30:03.660 --> 00:30:05.570
in the Brazilian
national colors.

00:30:05.570 --> 00:30:08.380
Again, in line with
what I was talking

00:30:08.380 --> 00:30:12.490
about this overtly
nationalistic posture.

00:30:12.490 --> 00:30:15.960
It remains to be seen
whether the left,

00:30:15.960 --> 00:30:18.350
represented by Fernando Haddad,

00:30:18.350 --> 00:30:22.100
can mobilize another
more constructive version

00:30:22.100 --> 00:30:25.770
of Brazilian utopianism,
one that would be predicated

00:30:25.770 --> 00:30:31.070
on social and economic justice
and on environmental harmony

00:30:31.070 --> 00:30:35.300
as a path for Brazil to live
up to its utopian promise.

00:30:35.300 --> 00:30:37.100
Thank you.

00:30:37.100 --> 00:30:50.330
[ Applause ]

00:30:50.330 --> 00:30:51.910
&gt;&gt; Thayse Lina: Hello, everyone.

00:30:51.910 --> 00:30:53.480
Good afternoon.

00:30:53.480 --> 00:30:54.780
Good afternoon.

00:30:54.780 --> 00:30:58.030
Thank you very much for
the Library and Talia

00:30:58.030 --> 00:31:02.130
and also Patrice here for
inviting me to discuss the book.

00:31:02.130 --> 00:31:04.900
Personally it's been a
pleasure to read the book,

00:31:04.900 --> 00:31:09.970
because I've been wrapped
around writing my own book,

00:31:09.970 --> 00:31:14.830
so it's good to read somebody
else's thoughts and ideas.

00:31:14.830 --> 00:31:18.480
On the other hand, on the
current context in Brazil,

00:31:18.480 --> 00:31:23.440
which is to say the least is
scary, it was also refreshing

00:31:23.440 --> 00:31:26.520
to have contact with some --

00:31:26.520 --> 00:31:28.510
with a book that is
discussing something positive

00:31:28.510 --> 00:31:31.410
for a change, which is utopia.

00:31:31.410 --> 00:31:32.940
Even though we know that --

00:31:32.940 --> 00:31:37.020
and I think that's what

00:31:37.020 --> 00:31:39.100
for [inaudible] perspective
is also very interesting

00:31:39.100 --> 00:31:41.920
from your book, is
that you refrain

00:31:41.920 --> 00:31:46.220
from discussing negative
utopias and you also disagree

00:31:46.220 --> 00:31:50.190
with the idea that utopians
will necessarily lead

00:31:50.190 --> 00:31:53.390
into totalitarian systems.

00:31:53.390 --> 00:31:56.960
So, that has been
refreshing as well,

00:31:56.960 --> 00:31:59.240
because I think very
often we read books

00:31:59.240 --> 00:32:03.120
that take a different
position, which are necessary

00:32:03.120 --> 00:32:07.370
and important to take a
critical position in relation

00:32:07.370 --> 00:32:12.040
to certain projects, right,
certain national projects

00:32:12.040 --> 00:32:14.050
in some ways you
imagine the country.

00:32:14.050 --> 00:32:17.910
But I think that the other
way around has been discussed

00:32:17.910 --> 00:32:22.570
and done to exhaustion, so I
found the book very original

00:32:22.570 --> 00:32:24.760
and very refreshing to read.

00:32:24.760 --> 00:32:29.390
So, I'm very glad I
was invited for this.

00:32:29.390 --> 00:32:34.760
So, I think we were going to
start with couple of questions,

00:32:34.760 --> 00:32:37.250
then I'm going to open
for everybody else.

00:32:37.250 --> 00:32:42.610
One of the things that I found
really interesting and new

00:32:42.610 --> 00:32:45.390
to the book that I was
talking to you before earlier

00:32:45.390 --> 00:32:49.880
on today was that even
though some of the projects

00:32:49.880 --> 00:32:53.530
that you discuss are known
and some are discussed,

00:32:53.530 --> 00:32:56.570
they were never organized
around the idea of utopia,

00:32:56.570 --> 00:33:00.630
which I found -- it was almost
this obvious thing that was

00:33:00.630 --> 00:33:03.900
in front of, that this is
permeating Brazilian history,

00:33:03.900 --> 00:33:06.550
Brazilian intellectual
history, but was never discussed

00:33:06.550 --> 00:33:10.060
as such organized as such and
I found it very interesting.

00:33:10.060 --> 00:33:15.070
So, as you were explaining
to everybody there's a lot

00:33:15.070 --> 00:33:19.330
of utopian streaks that run
through Brazilian history

00:33:19.330 --> 00:33:21.680
and some of them are
related to nature,

00:33:21.680 --> 00:33:24.910
some of them are political,
some of them are cultural,

00:33:24.910 --> 00:33:28.400
there are messianic ones,
and that is something

00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:30.730
that it found quite new.

00:33:30.730 --> 00:33:33.860
I never really thought about
our intellectual history

00:33:33.860 --> 00:33:35.160
through this lenses.

00:33:35.160 --> 00:33:40.380
So, I -- one of the questions
that I have for you is that,

00:33:40.380 --> 00:33:45.180
how you went about
organizing, it's such a long --

00:33:45.180 --> 00:33:50.610
it's such a large theme and it
runs through such a, you know,

00:33:50.610 --> 00:33:52.630
basically the whole
history of Brazil.

00:33:52.630 --> 00:33:55.690
Everything, the discoveries.

00:33:55.690 --> 00:34:00.230
How did you go about selecting
what you were going to have

00:34:00.230 --> 00:34:02.860
in the book and what you were
not going to have in the book?

00:34:02.860 --> 00:34:06.960
And I will ask you the question
that I asked you earlier on,

00:34:06.960 --> 00:34:12.270
which is, I found it interesting
and I wanted to ask you,

00:34:12.270 --> 00:34:15.920
one of the biggest, I
think, the most discussed,

00:34:15.920 --> 00:34:19.600
at least nowadays,
utopians, Brazilian utopians

00:34:19.600 --> 00:34:23.000
and also a failed
utopian, right,

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:27.940
is the idea of racial
democracy and was a tropicalism

00:34:27.940 --> 00:34:32.380
that [inaudible] was
writing in the 1930s.

00:34:32.380 --> 00:34:34.170
[inaudible] is a
Brazilian sociologist

00:34:34.170 --> 00:34:38.710
who wrote [inaudible], I
think is translated as.

00:34:38.710 --> 00:34:41.700
Masters and Slaves.

00:34:41.700 --> 00:34:43.300
Yeah, that's right.

00:34:43.300 --> 00:34:47.830
so, I was wondering, I
imagine the reason is

00:34:47.830 --> 00:34:51.340
because it's been discussed
to exhaustion lately, but,

00:34:51.340 --> 00:34:54.790
I wanted you to talk a little
bit more about this process

00:34:54.790 --> 00:34:57.890
of what going about selecting
what you were going to put

00:34:57.890 --> 00:35:01.460
and what you were going
to exclude from the book.

00:35:01.460 --> 00:35:02.760
&gt;&gt; Patricia Vieira:
Okay, that's --

00:35:02.760 --> 00:35:04.910
it's actually a very good
question and I struggled

00:35:04.910 --> 00:35:08.470
with what I was going to
include for a long time.

00:35:08.470 --> 00:35:12.640
First of all, to the first half
of the question, of course,

00:35:12.640 --> 00:35:18.420
this utopian streak is not
something that is part only

00:35:18.420 --> 00:35:21.510
of Brazil, but it's really
part of most American nations,

00:35:21.510 --> 00:35:24.220
because the idea was
that Europeans would come

00:35:24.220 --> 00:35:28.370
to the new world and this very
concept of the world being new,

00:35:28.370 --> 00:35:31.380
of course, it was not new,
there were people here before.

00:35:31.380 --> 00:35:35.270
But the conception when the
Europeans arrived with this

00:35:35.270 --> 00:35:38.640
that they were arriving
at kind of a blank slate

00:35:38.640 --> 00:35:41.910
where they could start
anew and avoid the mistakes

00:35:41.910 --> 00:35:43.440
that they had made in Europe.

00:35:43.440 --> 00:35:47.590
So, the idea that they could
create a better society

00:35:47.590 --> 00:35:52.950
in the New World and
the every publication

00:35:52.950 --> 00:35:55.790
of Thomas More's Utopia
is indebted to this idea,

00:35:55.790 --> 00:35:59.310
because finally you
had a new world

00:35:59.310 --> 00:36:02.640
where you could project all
of these dreams of social,

00:36:02.640 --> 00:36:05.100
political and economic
emancipation

00:36:05.100 --> 00:36:10.030
that you could no longer think
of in Europe because Europe was

00:36:10.030 --> 00:36:12.480
so corrupt and decadent
and so on and so on.

00:36:12.480 --> 00:36:16.570
So, the very concept of
a New World is what made

00:36:16.570 --> 00:36:17.900
utopia possible.

00:36:17.900 --> 00:36:26.040
So, utopia became part of the
makeup of American nations,

00:36:26.040 --> 00:36:29.800
much more than it was
of European nations.

00:36:29.800 --> 00:36:32.710
And in the case of
Brazil, as you were saying,

00:36:32.710 --> 00:36:36.510
I think what struck me is that
even though it's so much a part

00:36:36.510 --> 00:36:40.060
of Brazilian history, it hadn't
been studied systemically

00:36:40.060 --> 00:36:44.650
and there were a few articles
here and there about utopia

00:36:44.650 --> 00:36:47.730
and especially the
utopias in Brazil.

00:36:47.730 --> 00:36:49.690
But there was not
a systematic study

00:36:49.690 --> 00:36:52.820
of how utopia had
impacted Brazilian thought.

00:36:52.820 --> 00:36:57.690
And, so, that was
what I tried to do.

00:36:57.690 --> 00:37:03.690
And I selected -- I
didn't want to study books

00:37:03.690 --> 00:37:06.190
that were utopias, in the sense

00:37:06.190 --> 00:37:10.070
that they presented
alternative visions of reality.

00:37:10.070 --> 00:37:11.740
That was not my main goal.

00:37:11.740 --> 00:37:14.310
My main goal was really
to study utopian thought

00:37:14.310 --> 00:37:20.540
as it presented itself, either
in literature or in books

00:37:20.540 --> 00:37:25.570
that were -- books of
sociology, essays and so on

00:37:25.570 --> 00:37:30.480
and that had become key to
thinking what Brazil is today.

00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:33.820
And, so, I went about
studying this --

00:37:33.820 --> 00:37:36.890
and selecting the key moments.

00:37:36.890 --> 00:37:39.830
I wanted to key moments
in Brazilian history

00:37:39.830 --> 00:37:42.410
that on the one hand
would be representative

00:37:42.410 --> 00:37:45.080
of utopian thoughts in Brazil,

00:37:45.080 --> 00:37:48.410
so I needed to include
messianism, for instance,

00:37:48.410 --> 00:37:52.460
as the root of utopian
thinking in Brazil.

00:37:52.460 --> 00:37:55.470
So, the -- like the
theological base

00:37:55.470 --> 00:37:59.940
from which posterior
utopia is developed.

00:37:59.940 --> 00:38:03.570
So, that was something
I knew had to be there.

00:38:03.570 --> 00:38:05.860
And then I tried to
select other moments

00:38:05.860 --> 00:38:07.210
that would be representative.

00:38:07.210 --> 00:38:14.620
So, I wanted to have one chapter
on the environment as a utopia,

00:38:14.620 --> 00:38:16.980
so that was also for sure.

00:38:16.980 --> 00:38:19.820
The part on leisure I was
also absolutely sure I wanted

00:38:19.820 --> 00:38:21.260
to write about.

00:38:21.260 --> 00:38:24.400
Now, the issue of race could
have been another chapter

00:38:24.400 --> 00:38:27.610
in the book, but as you
mentioned, it's something

00:38:27.610 --> 00:38:30.980
that has been studied a
lot in Brazil, so I thought

00:38:30.980 --> 00:38:35.140
that I was not going to be
able to say anything as new

00:38:35.140 --> 00:38:40.230
on utopia, on racial democracy
as I could say on other topics.

00:38:40.230 --> 00:38:42.170
So, that's why I
kind of bracketed it.

00:38:42.170 --> 00:38:44.640
I also didn't mention, as
we were talking before,

00:38:44.640 --> 00:38:49.480
I could have written a chapter
on the issue of the reworking

00:38:49.480 --> 00:38:54.270
of messanism in the
beginning of the 20th century

00:38:54.270 --> 00:38:59.500
with [inaudible]
writing about this issue.

00:38:59.500 --> 00:39:01.950
But, again, I decided
against it,

00:39:01.950 --> 00:39:04.970
because so much scholarship
has been produced on this

00:39:04.970 --> 00:39:06.710
that in the end I
thought I wouldn't be able

00:39:06.710 --> 00:39:10.340
to add anything very
substantive to the topic.

00:39:10.340 --> 00:39:15.080
But, so, yes, I wanted to
have key moments in utopianism

00:39:15.080 --> 00:39:18.510
in Brazil and how it
has changed and evolved,

00:39:18.510 --> 00:39:20.650
especially in the 20th century.

00:39:20.650 --> 00:39:26.670
So that was the rationale behind
the choice of the chapters.

00:39:26.670 --> 00:39:28.750
&gt;&gt; Thayse Lina: One
more thing that I --

00:39:28.750 --> 00:39:31.130
after your presentation
I was thinking

00:39:31.130 --> 00:39:34.360
about what you just
said and how --

00:39:34.360 --> 00:39:37.570
obviously as I was reading
the book I couldn't help

00:39:37.570 --> 00:39:40.490
but to think about the moment
that we are going on right now

00:39:40.490 --> 00:39:42.800
in Brazil and I was really
glad that you brought it

00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:44.650
up in your presentation.

00:39:44.650 --> 00:39:49.450
I was surprised and I've
never really thought

00:39:49.450 --> 00:39:52.810
about Balsonaro representing
somehow, like,

00:39:52.810 --> 00:39:55.300
or I've never really thought
about how he brings back some

00:39:55.300 --> 00:39:58.940
of the utopias that you
discussed or representing

00:39:58.940 --> 00:40:02.530
or presenting some sort of
utopian view for the Brazilians,

00:40:02.530 --> 00:40:04.770
because so much of what
he says is associated

00:40:04.770 --> 00:40:09.300
with actually fear and,
right, and he's running

00:40:09.300 --> 00:40:14.830
through this fear and that's
how constructed his platform

00:40:14.830 --> 00:40:17.400
and his discourse.

00:40:17.400 --> 00:40:19.780
But it's certainly
something refreshing.

00:40:19.780 --> 00:40:23.040
It made me think
about something else.

00:40:23.040 --> 00:40:25.590
What it made me think about
is that most of the times

00:40:25.590 --> 00:40:29.110
when you're talking about
utopia we think about --

00:40:29.110 --> 00:40:32.790
you're thinking with the
intellectual lead of Brazil

00:40:32.790 --> 00:40:35.810
and they dream of what
the country could be

00:40:35.810 --> 00:40:38.640
and the confrontation with
the realities of it, right?

00:40:38.640 --> 00:40:41.480
That since all of these
actually fall short,

00:40:41.480 --> 00:40:44.940
because these utopias are
actually rethinking core

00:40:44.940 --> 00:40:53.200
problems of the country, which
are inequality, racial injustice

00:40:53.200 --> 00:40:54.500
and so on and so forth.

00:40:54.500 --> 00:40:58.180
So, we always feel
like it's falling short

00:40:58.180 --> 00:41:00.780
of fixing those problems, right?

00:41:00.780 --> 00:41:05.050
But as I was thinking about
it, I was thinking I had

00:41:05.050 --> 00:41:09.590
to actually recheck my
position on Balsonato, at least,

00:41:09.590 --> 00:41:12.230
not on Balsonato, but on the
people that are voting for him,

00:41:12.230 --> 00:41:16.160
because I think in light of
what happened two days ago,

00:41:16.160 --> 00:41:19.360
49 million people voted for him.

00:41:19.360 --> 00:41:22.230
You ask yourself, what
people are thinking, like,

00:41:22.230 --> 00:41:24.180
they really condone these ideas

00:41:24.180 --> 00:41:28.960
and are they really
supportive of this.

00:41:28.960 --> 00:41:31.870
Or is actually what is moving
them is something else,

00:41:31.870 --> 00:41:33.500
it's that they believe

00:41:33.500 --> 00:41:40.090
that somehow disregarding
all the violent threats

00:41:40.090 --> 00:41:41.630
that is coming from
this candidate,

00:41:41.630 --> 00:41:45.450
he somewhat offers a
view of the country

00:41:45.450 --> 00:41:49.450
that they actually think
it's important possible.

00:41:49.450 --> 00:41:52.310
So, my question, I
think, is it has to do

00:41:52.310 --> 00:41:54.160
with this disconnect perhaps

00:41:54.160 --> 00:41:56.560
and if you think there
is a disconnection

00:41:56.560 --> 00:42:00.950
between what the Brazilian
elites imagine about Brazil --

00:42:00.950 --> 00:42:03.500
and I'm sorry I go
back to [inaudible],

00:42:03.500 --> 00:42:07.000
because I think it's kind of
like a poignant example of that,

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:09.840
but you can see it in
other ones as well.

00:42:09.840 --> 00:42:12.640
I mean, and the idea of
coming together that you see

00:42:12.640 --> 00:42:15.530
in Macunaima, the
ideas of community

00:42:15.530 --> 00:42:17.460
and the [inaudible]
community, it's also there.

00:42:17.460 --> 00:42:21.020
So, if there is a disconnect
between the dreams of the elite

00:42:21.020 --> 00:42:24.150
and the dreams of
the people out there,

00:42:24.150 --> 00:42:28.630
the ones that we're not studying
or reading or having access to,

00:42:28.630 --> 00:42:32.310
but it's more your
opinion about it, I guess.

00:42:32.310 --> 00:42:33.610
&gt;&gt; Patricia Vieira: I think --

00:42:33.610 --> 00:42:37.230
I think to a certain extent
there is a disconnect,

00:42:37.230 --> 00:42:41.890
but I think to a certain extent
also the elites are responding

00:42:41.890 --> 00:42:43.980
to something that
is in the country.

00:42:43.980 --> 00:42:47.050
Let me make this more concrete.

00:42:47.050 --> 00:42:51.450
In the case of the current
elections I don't think there is

00:42:51.450 --> 00:42:54.380
so much of a disconnect
between Balsonaro

00:42:54.380 --> 00:42:57.180
and the Brazilian
elites and the country.

00:42:57.180 --> 00:43:01.180
I think he really
embodies many of the ideas

00:43:01.180 --> 00:43:05.450
that have been latent in Brazil
throughout -- for centuries.

00:43:05.450 --> 00:43:08.910
Again, the fact that he
presents himself as a savior

00:43:08.910 --> 00:43:11.600
of the country, who is
going to bring stability,

00:43:11.600 --> 00:43:13.990
peace, prosperity and so on.

00:43:13.990 --> 00:43:18.860
This was a discourse, messianic
discourse that has been part

00:43:18.860 --> 00:43:23.350
of Brazil for centuries
and is described very well

00:43:23.350 --> 00:43:26.840
by [inaudible] in the
Back Lands when he talks

00:43:26.840 --> 00:43:29.910
about Antonio [inaudible]
and why people voted for him.

00:43:29.910 --> 00:43:34.350
I mean, it's shocking,
but people in many

00:43:34.350 --> 00:43:40.220
of the Brazilian slums or
villas, he won, so the people

00:43:40.220 --> 00:43:42.060
that are going to
be more impacted

00:43:42.060 --> 00:43:45.440
by his policies are
voting for him exactly

00:43:45.440 --> 00:43:50.980
because he has been very
clever at appropriating some

00:43:50.980 --> 00:43:54.260
of these cultural tropes, some
of these cultural themes are

00:43:54.260 --> 00:43:56.530
that are so much part
of Brazilian history

00:43:56.530 --> 00:43:59.710
and of the way Brazilians
think about themselves.

00:43:59.710 --> 00:44:02.710
And I think this is why
he has been so successful.

00:44:02.710 --> 00:44:06.800
And, on the other hand, he has
also capitalized on this feeling

00:44:06.800 --> 00:44:11.080
of discontent that is
also, as I was saying,

00:44:11.080 --> 00:44:15.490
also comes out of this idea
that you're never able to live

00:44:15.490 --> 00:44:18.260
up to the utopian promise
as a Brazilian purpose.

00:44:18.260 --> 00:44:22.200
And, so, you're always
falling short

00:44:22.200 --> 00:44:23.940
and he has capitalized on this.

00:44:23.940 --> 00:44:26.170
He's saying, "I'm
going to overcome this,

00:44:26.170 --> 00:44:29.040
we will not fall short
of Brazil's promise,

00:44:29.040 --> 00:44:31.440
but we will tackle
these problems

00:44:31.440 --> 00:44:33.200
and we will overcome them."

00:44:33.200 --> 00:44:37.540
Right? So, I think he has
been a very smart politician.

00:44:37.540 --> 00:44:42.250
I don't know if he has done this
more or less without thinking

00:44:42.250 --> 00:44:45.850
or if his team of advisors have
really thought this through,

00:44:45.850 --> 00:44:50.070
but the fact of the matter is
he has used cultural elements

00:44:50.070 --> 00:44:53.860
that have been very
prevalent in Brazilian thought

00:44:53.860 --> 00:44:56.110
and he has used them to
his advantage in a way

00:44:56.110 --> 00:44:58.700
that I think the left
has been unable to do

00:44:58.700 --> 00:45:00.490
and that's why he won.

00:45:00.490 --> 00:45:03.730
So, it's not that he's the
candidate of the elites

00:45:03.730 --> 00:45:05.480
and the people didn't
vote for him.

00:45:05.480 --> 00:45:07.800
No, the people actually
voted for him,

00:45:07.800 --> 00:45:09.970
it was not just the
Brazilian elite,

00:45:09.970 --> 00:45:13.490
so I think this division
here doesn't apply

00:45:13.490 --> 00:45:16.530
because he has really
been selected.

00:45:16.530 --> 00:45:21.120
I mean, if anything, there
is a geographic imbalance,

00:45:21.120 --> 00:45:24.680
because I think the only
region that did not vote

00:45:24.680 --> 00:45:27.800
for him was the northeast
for historical reasons,

00:45:27.800 --> 00:45:32.290
Lula being very popular in
the northeast and so on.

00:45:32.290 --> 00:45:33.590
&gt;&gt; Thayse Lina: I think
I was thinking more

00:45:33.590 --> 00:45:38.470
about the enlightened
midcentury elite and the dreams

00:45:38.470 --> 00:45:41.490
of the country coming together
and being more egalitarian.

00:45:41.490 --> 00:45:42.790
And that's actually something

00:45:42.790 --> 00:45:45.150
that is lacking on
his discourse.

00:45:45.150 --> 00:45:47.730
But I appreciate
what you're saying

00:45:47.730 --> 00:45:51.650
about how he actually
has conquered the support

00:45:51.650 --> 00:45:55.920
of the elites and in some
parts of the population

00:45:55.920 --> 00:45:57.220
that would be directly affected

00:45:57.220 --> 00:46:01.440
by what he's bringing
to his candidacy.

00:46:01.440 --> 00:46:05.770
I don't know if I should -- we
should open to questions now

00:46:05.770 --> 00:46:10.050
or if I -- I want to give
people the opportunity

00:46:10.050 --> 00:46:11.580
to ask her questions too.

00:46:11.580 --> 00:46:14.310
I have a lot of questions.

00:46:14.310 --> 00:46:21.680
&gt;&gt; I have a question or two.

00:46:21.680 --> 00:46:22.980
[inaudible].

00:46:22.980 --> 00:46:24.290
First, thank you for
the presentation.

00:46:24.290 --> 00:46:27.500
Is it possible for me --

00:46:27.500 --> 00:46:30.820
when you're talking about
this [inaudible], for example,

00:46:30.820 --> 00:46:37.560
of the [inaudible] we have in
this [inaudible] of some sort

00:46:37.560 --> 00:46:41.410
of utopia, you know,
[inaudible].

00:46:41.410 --> 00:46:48.630
First, I have a curiosity
about [inaudible] and the role

00:46:48.630 --> 00:46:51.960
that she plays in
this utopian thought

00:46:51.960 --> 00:46:56.740
and how do you use her book,
particularly the [inaudible] GH

00:46:56.740 --> 00:47:00.610
that we have here in this place,

00:47:00.610 --> 00:47:02.850
I would like to hear
your thoughts on it

00:47:02.850 --> 00:47:05.910
and how you represent
her in your book.

00:47:05.910 --> 00:47:10.380
And another one is I
wonder if in your studies

00:47:10.380 --> 00:47:14.490
for this book you
came across this idea

00:47:14.490 --> 00:47:17.770
of utopian thought coming
from indigenous [inaudible].

00:47:17.770 --> 00:47:22.120
We've heard of how Europeans
sort of rigged this idea

00:47:22.120 --> 00:47:26.170
of utopia with them
and then it's reworked

00:47:26.170 --> 00:47:29.340
through other moments by
Brazilians themselves, you know,

00:47:29.340 --> 00:47:34.500
[inaudible] later on and
the mid-19th century.

00:47:34.500 --> 00:47:37.480
But I'm wondering if in your
studies as a [inaudible],

00:47:37.480 --> 00:47:40.800
the utopia from [inaudible]?

00:47:40.800 --> 00:47:42.100
&gt;&gt; Patricia Vieira: Oh great.

00:47:42.100 --> 00:47:43.400
Those are great questions.

00:47:43.400 --> 00:47:46.780
So, first about the
utopia from sources

00:47:46.780 --> 00:47:49.170
that are not literature
or essays and so on.

00:47:49.170 --> 00:47:51.770
Of course, perhaps the most
obvious one would be the

00:47:51.770 --> 00:47:57.100
construction of Brasilia in the
1960s as this utopian moment

00:47:57.100 --> 00:48:02.290
of creating a space that would
be completely new and modern.

00:48:02.290 --> 00:48:04.740
So, again, this attempt
of Brazil to catch

00:48:04.740 --> 00:48:07.760
up with the future, right,
and utopia is very --

00:48:07.760 --> 00:48:13.380
Brazil is very futuristic in
its architecture as you --

00:48:13.380 --> 00:48:17.650
those of you who know it can
probably imagine the center

00:48:17.650 --> 00:48:20.190
of Brasilia as this
attempt really

00:48:20.190 --> 00:48:24.870
to create the utopian space
concretely, architecturally.

00:48:24.870 --> 00:48:29.910
Then [inaudible],
so I read her book

00:48:29.910 --> 00:48:32.530
through what I call
interspecies literature,

00:48:32.530 --> 00:48:36.210
and this is my new project
I'm working on, literature

00:48:36.210 --> 00:48:40.350
and the environment and how
we can think of literature

00:48:40.350 --> 00:48:45.290
as a space where we give
voice to non-human beings

00:48:45.290 --> 00:48:50.850
and how non-human beings plants,
animals impact literary --

00:48:50.850 --> 00:48:54.020
literature and writings
and also cinema.

00:48:54.020 --> 00:48:58.430
So, that's how I try to read,
The Passion According to GH,

00:48:58.430 --> 00:49:02.220
how the animal in the story
impacts the very writing

00:49:02.220 --> 00:49:03.520
of the story.

00:49:03.520 --> 00:49:05.660
So, that's through there.

00:49:05.660 --> 00:49:09.260
And about the indigenous
cultures,

00:49:09.260 --> 00:49:14.450
whether utopia is also part of
Brazilian indigenous thought,

00:49:14.450 --> 00:49:20.470
I haven't read too much
anthropological studies,

00:49:20.470 --> 00:49:24.710
but there is the concept of the
land without evil in [inaudible]

00:49:24.710 --> 00:49:28.940
in indigenous Brazilian
and throughout the Americas

00:49:28.940 --> 00:49:32.770
and I forget, I don't
know if any

00:49:32.770 --> 00:49:35.990
of you are an anthropologist,
there is even a group

00:49:35.990 --> 00:49:39.760
of Brazilian indigenous
peoples who used to go

00:49:39.760 --> 00:49:43.030
on a pilgrimage every few
years looking for this land

00:49:43.030 --> 00:49:44.910
without evil, so
they would just --

00:49:44.910 --> 00:49:47.040
they were settled
in a specific place

00:49:47.040 --> 00:49:50.290
and they would just take off
and go look for this land

00:49:50.290 --> 00:49:52.000
without evil that
has been compared

00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:54.250
to the Christian paradise.

00:49:54.250 --> 00:49:58.880
And, so, the idea is presence
in indigenous thought.

00:49:58.880 --> 00:50:01.690
I mean, one might
argue that utopia in

00:50:01.690 --> 00:50:04.240
and of itself is part
of human culture.

00:50:04.240 --> 00:50:08.310
That in one form or another,
it might not be called utopia

00:50:08.310 --> 00:50:13.510
because other cultures might
not have a name for this idea,

00:50:13.510 --> 00:50:17.010
which western culture did
not have a name for utopia

00:50:17.010 --> 00:50:19.700
until Thomas More
published Utopia.

00:50:19.700 --> 00:50:24.040
But the idea of something
better than the current state

00:50:24.040 --> 00:50:29.330
of affairs is very much a part
of human cultures throughout,

00:50:29.330 --> 00:50:33.730
so it would not be surprising
that it exists, you know,

00:50:33.730 --> 00:50:40.120
in Native American thoughts and,
of course, in Asian literature,

00:50:40.120 --> 00:50:43.270
it's full of utopia --
examples of what we call utopia

00:50:43.270 --> 00:50:45.570
in the west, so, yeah.

00:50:49.450 --> 00:50:51.510
Any other questions or comments.

00:50:51.510 --> 00:50:58.040
[ Inaudible Speaker ]

00:50:58.040 --> 00:51:07.250
&gt;&gt; I kind have a question,
but I want to make sure

00:51:07.250 --> 00:51:18.940
that if I ask it doesn't
misunderstand your first part

00:51:18.940 --> 00:51:21.050
of the lecture.

00:51:21.050 --> 00:51:27.730
So, and also I want to
reiterate what you just asked,

00:51:27.730 --> 00:51:33.710
but you mentioned
agriculture -- not agriculture,

00:51:33.710 --> 00:51:38.770
but environmentalism and the
connection with [inaudible]

00:51:38.770 --> 00:51:43.330
and [inaudible] and
this kind of view

00:51:43.330 --> 00:51:46.430
that now Amazon is bringing
us this [inaudible].

00:51:46.430 --> 00:51:52.370
So, how do we reconcile
the forced labor

00:51:52.370 --> 00:51:57.710
that was brought upon
by the rubber movement?

00:51:57.710 --> 00:52:05.440
At least in my experience is
studying Peru in the Amazon

00:52:05.440 --> 00:52:09.720
and there was what be
[inaudible] genocide

00:52:09.720 --> 00:52:12.210
because of the rubber move,

00:52:12.210 --> 00:52:14.280
so how does this
utopian narrative kind

00:52:14.280 --> 00:52:17.670
of reconcile itself with
finding a better purpose

00:52:17.670 --> 00:52:19.660
and better society
when there's --

00:52:19.660 --> 00:52:20.960
it's paved the way
by [inaudible]?

00:52:20.960 --> 00:52:22.260
&gt;&gt; Patricia Vieira:
Right, right.

00:52:22.260 --> 00:52:23.740
Yeah, so, what I was saying
is that this utopian image

00:52:23.740 --> 00:52:27.630
of Brazil has been very much
connected with natural resources

00:52:27.630 --> 00:52:31.040
that were very abundant
in Brazil.

00:52:31.040 --> 00:52:33.320
Of course, no one ever
reflected how those were going

00:52:33.320 --> 00:52:35.500
to be extracted, which was
mostly by either slave labor

00:52:35.500 --> 00:52:38.220
or later forced labor.

00:52:38.220 --> 00:52:41.730
But, so, from a perspective of
the outsiders who were going

00:52:41.730 --> 00:52:47.630
to colonize Brazil, this was
one of the main attractions

00:52:47.630 --> 00:52:55.690
that you could go to Brazil and
just get wealthy very quickly,

00:52:55.690 --> 00:53:01.490
because that country was just
so rich in natural resources,

00:53:01.490 --> 00:53:04.730
so that was the utopian
moment there.

00:53:04.730 --> 00:53:07.760
In the Amazon, more
specifically, in my chapter

00:53:07.760 --> 00:53:13.140
about the Amazon, what I
studied was really the myth

00:53:13.140 --> 00:53:18.110
of the amazons, which are --
it's what gave the name Amazon

00:53:18.110 --> 00:53:23.110
to the Amazon and these were
just some female warriors

00:53:23.110 --> 00:53:27.540
from classical Greece that
when the first colonizers went

00:53:27.540 --> 00:53:29.680
to the Amazon they thought

00:53:29.680 --> 00:53:33.110
that they saw these women
there along with the river.

00:53:33.110 --> 00:53:38.260
So, they gave the name the river
of the Amazons to the Amazon

00:53:38.260 --> 00:53:40.050
and that's where
the name comes from.

00:53:40.050 --> 00:53:42.480
So, later on, in the
beginning of the 20th century,

00:53:42.480 --> 00:53:45.300
this group of women was -- there
are several books of literature

00:53:45.300 --> 00:53:46.860
that present this group of
women as a utopian society.

00:53:46.860 --> 00:53:48.160
And, so, there are
stories such as, you know,

00:53:48.160 --> 00:53:49.460
outsider enters the Amazon,
gets lost, goes to the tribe

00:53:49.460 --> 00:53:50.760
of the amazons and realizes
they live a great life

00:53:50.760 --> 00:53:52.060
where everyone is equal
and people share the burden

00:53:52.060 --> 00:53:53.360
of work and so and so.

00:53:53.360 --> 00:53:54.660
They are presented as this
utopian society that contrasts

00:53:54.660 --> 00:53:55.960
with the inequalities
of the rest of Brazil.

00:53:55.960 --> 00:53:57.260
So, that's the utopian moment.

00:53:57.260 --> 00:53:58.560
And, of course, this is located
in the Amazon, because it's

00:53:58.560 --> 00:53:59.860
that open space of possibility
where anything can happen

00:53:59.860 --> 00:54:01.160
because it's just so huge.

00:54:01.160 --> 00:54:04.360
Yeah.

00:54:04.360 --> 00:54:09.640
&gt;&gt; How is utopian is the
[inaudible] and shared labor

00:54:09.640 --> 00:54:14.450
and that sort of thing,
how do you then [inaudible]

00:54:14.450 --> 00:54:16.400
with authoritarian control?

00:54:16.400 --> 00:54:21.860
I mean, how was he able
to create this narrative,

00:54:21.860 --> 00:54:31.710
is it simply just harkening
back to the good old days or --

00:54:31.710 --> 00:54:35.600
because I always thought it
had to have this future goal?

00:54:35.600 --> 00:54:38.140
How is this [inaudible]
able to square [inaudible]?

00:54:38.140 --> 00:54:39.610
&gt;&gt; Patricia Vieira: Yeah,
no, I think you're right.

00:54:39.610 --> 00:54:46.160
There are different strands
of utopianism in Brazil.

00:54:46.160 --> 00:54:50.990
So, one of them is this
egalitarian horizontal view

00:54:50.990 --> 00:54:54.690
of society that is present,
for instance, in the conception

00:54:54.690 --> 00:54:58.260
of laziness and leisure, Brazil
as a country, that is able

00:54:58.260 --> 00:55:00.130
to provide for everyone
so people won't have

00:55:00.130 --> 00:55:01.430
to work and so and so on.

00:55:01.430 --> 00:55:03.120
So, that's one strand.

00:55:03.120 --> 00:55:08.450
Now the messianic strands of
utopian, which comes directly

00:55:08.450 --> 00:55:13.690
from theology, always has an
authoritarian streak to it.

00:55:13.690 --> 00:55:15.950
even if we think about one

00:55:15.950 --> 00:55:22.600
of the most famous messianic
real life experiments in Brazil,

00:55:22.600 --> 00:55:25.700
which was described, as I
mentioned, by [inaudible]

00:55:25.700 --> 00:55:29.610
in the Back Lands, famous
book, which [inaudible] Brazil

00:55:29.610 --> 00:55:32.790
where he describes
a community living

00:55:32.790 --> 00:55:34.320
in the back lands of Brazil.

00:55:34.320 --> 00:55:38.200
The leader of this
community, Antonio [inaudible],

00:55:38.200 --> 00:55:43.900
he was what we would call today
really an authoritarian leader

00:55:43.900 --> 00:55:46.360
within this community, right?

00:55:46.360 --> 00:55:49.310
So, I think that
[inaudible] harks back

00:55:49.310 --> 00:55:55.190
to that particular strand of
utopian thought that goes back

00:55:55.190 --> 00:55:58.590
to the messianic tradition
and to authoritarianism

00:55:58.590 --> 00:56:01.210
within the messianic
tradition, right?

00:56:01.210 --> 00:56:06.670
And what I was suggesting is
that I think he has been able

00:56:06.670 --> 00:56:12.500
to activate something that has
been part of a Brazilian culture

00:56:12.500 --> 00:56:16.690
for a very long time, which
is this thinking of messianism

00:56:16.690 --> 00:56:20.030
and the savior that will come
and make everything right.

00:56:20.030 --> 00:56:23.770
And this savior often has
authoritarian characteristics.

00:56:23.770 --> 00:56:25.550
I mean, historically.

00:56:25.550 --> 00:56:28.880
And so people tend to
accept his authoritarianism

00:56:28.880 --> 00:56:32.390
because there are other examples
in Brazilian history of this.

00:56:32.390 --> 00:56:34.820
And, so, it jus t-- he
falls back onto something

00:56:34.820 --> 00:56:37.910
that already exists in the
culture and that's why, I think,

00:56:37.910 --> 00:56:40.970
he's so accepted and
so popular really.

00:56:52.550 --> 00:56:57.060
&gt;&gt; Maybe we have time
for one more questions?

00:56:57.060 --> 00:56:58.360
&gt;&gt; Thayse Lina: I do.

00:56:58.360 --> 00:56:59.660
&gt;&gt; Patricia Vieira:
One last time.

00:56:59.660 --> 00:57:02.060
&gt;&gt; Thayse Lina: I think that
I was talking to you about it

00:57:02.060 --> 00:57:05.570
that -- and I think I'm going
to kind of recuperate some

00:57:05.570 --> 00:57:07.980
of your questions
in a certain way.

00:57:07.980 --> 00:57:15.200
It was impossible for me to read
a book about utopianism and not

00:57:15.200 --> 00:57:19.480
to think -- not about
necessarily negative utopia,

00:57:19.480 --> 00:57:23.300
which would be kind of like an
apocalyptical thoughts and --

00:57:23.300 --> 00:57:25.690
right, and it would
fall into nihilism.

00:57:25.690 --> 00:57:31.750
But mostly about this disconnect
that you see between this dreams

00:57:31.750 --> 00:57:42.100
of a better more egalitarian
country, and the reality that --

00:57:42.100 --> 00:57:45.700
does these authors were
themselves experiencing

00:57:45.700 --> 00:57:47.110
at the time that
they were writing.

00:57:47.110 --> 00:57:51.470
And what is interesting is that
not only that I understand that

00:57:51.470 --> 00:57:53.690
and you make it very
clear in the introduction

00:57:53.690 --> 00:57:57.650
that utopias are not
necessarily to be --

00:57:57.650 --> 00:58:01.960
to become a reality or to be,
right, put to work in actuality,

00:58:01.960 --> 00:58:05.820
at least not in the intellectual
tradition that you are studying.

00:58:05.820 --> 00:58:10.580
They are supposed to work as a
north, right, to be aspired to

00:58:10.580 --> 00:58:12.990
and that we are going towards.

00:58:12.990 --> 00:58:17.040
But, to recuperating what
people were saying is,

00:58:17.040 --> 00:58:21.110
especially if you're looking
at Brazil from the outside,

00:58:21.110 --> 00:58:24.480
it always -- it doesn't only
feel like a disconnection

00:58:24.480 --> 00:58:28.630
between reality and thoughts
and dreams, but it also seems

00:58:28.630 --> 00:58:32.230
that this very reality,
or the dreams

00:58:32.230 --> 00:58:38.810
of this more utopian
future are sometimes trying

00:58:38.810 --> 00:58:41.110
to fix that reality, right?

00:58:41.110 --> 00:58:45.490
Trying to create like another
or to encompass that problem

00:58:45.490 --> 00:58:51.070
or that they're seeing there and
to do something else with it.

00:58:51.070 --> 00:58:56.500
I think that it becomes
really clear in the utopians

00:58:56.500 --> 00:59:01.620
of leisure, which is in a
way a revolt against, right,

00:59:01.620 --> 00:59:03.990
or protest against
the imposition

00:59:03.990 --> 00:59:06.710
or the necessity of work, right?

00:59:06.710 --> 00:59:09.590
So, I wonder if at any point

00:59:09.590 --> 00:59:14.800
when you're writing these ideas
were there with you, you know,

00:59:14.800 --> 00:59:18.810
thinking about how
there is this contrast?

00:59:18.810 --> 00:59:21.010
&gt;&gt; Patricia Vieira: Yeah,
that's a great question

00:59:21.010 --> 00:59:25.380
and I think that's the main
criticism against utopia

00:59:25.380 --> 00:59:28.530
and the argument that
utopia sometimes leads

00:59:28.530 --> 00:59:31.620
to authoritarianism
goes back to that.

00:59:31.620 --> 00:59:35.990
That in order to achieve the
utopian goal, anything goes.

00:59:35.990 --> 00:59:37.890
So you can do anything
politically

00:59:37.890 --> 00:59:40.240
because you have a goal
that you need to achieve.

00:59:40.240 --> 00:59:42.660
That was the problem,
for instance,

00:59:42.660 --> 00:59:44.950
of communism as a system.

00:59:44.950 --> 00:59:47.720
A political system
that -- how is it --

00:59:47.720 --> 00:59:52.140
the ends justified
the means, right?

00:59:52.140 --> 00:59:56.810
So, when I was studying
utopianism in Brazil I worked

00:59:56.810 --> 00:59:59.710
with a different notion
of utopia that I called

00:59:59.710 --> 01:00:03.380
in another book I
co-edited a few years ago,

01:00:03.380 --> 01:00:05.200
existential utopia.

01:00:05.200 --> 01:00:07.540
And, so, by existential
utopia, I mean,

01:00:07.540 --> 01:00:12.990
utopia not as a goal
that's somehow hovers above

01:00:12.990 --> 01:00:17.050
and beyond society in the
future, but as the utopia

01:00:17.050 --> 01:00:21.240
as something that is imbedded
in every day practices, right?

01:00:21.240 --> 01:00:25.590
And that's why, for instance,
I think utopia is related

01:00:25.590 --> 01:00:27.310
to the environment
are so powerful,

01:00:27.310 --> 01:00:29.630
because the environment
is something you encounter

01:00:29.630 --> 01:00:31.170
on an everyday basis.

01:00:31.170 --> 01:00:32.970
It's not something out there.

01:00:32.970 --> 01:00:34.750
And, again, issues of leisure.

01:00:34.750 --> 01:00:41.620
People work every day, they
experience labor every day,

01:00:41.620 --> 01:00:45.240
so utopias of leisure
are not something

01:00:45.240 --> 01:00:48.220
that somehow could
exist in somewhere

01:00:48.220 --> 01:00:51.480
in a very distance future, but
they are something that speaks

01:00:51.480 --> 01:00:53.560
to our realities in the present.

01:00:53.560 --> 01:00:57.610
And I think that's the only way
that a concept, such as the one

01:00:57.610 --> 01:01:01.470
of utopia, can still be relevant
today, is if we think about it

01:01:01.470 --> 01:01:06.340
as operative on an everyday
basis and not as something

01:01:06.340 --> 01:01:10.540
that we should really try to
reach sometime in the future

01:01:10.540 --> 01:01:14.580
and that ends up being almost
oppressive in the present.

01:01:14.580 --> 01:01:18.640
So, to the country I think
utopias should make us feel

01:01:18.640 --> 01:01:22.180
uncomfortable in the
present, but in a good way.

01:01:22.180 --> 01:01:26.620
Showing us that the present can
be better, but not as some sort

01:01:26.620 --> 01:01:30.330
of an ideal that we always have
to match and we can never match.

01:01:30.330 --> 01:01:35.230
But as the kind of
making us slightly --

01:01:35.230 --> 01:01:37.540
how I should put this --

01:01:37.540 --> 01:01:40.080
slightly uncomfortable
where we sit knowing

01:01:40.080 --> 01:01:42.720
that we could be a
bit better, right?

01:01:42.720 --> 01:01:45.260
So, I think that's
the kind of utopia

01:01:45.260 --> 01:01:49.520
that is valuable
politically today, right,

01:01:49.520 --> 01:01:53.920
a utopia that makes us see
that things could be better,

01:01:53.920 --> 01:01:57.740
but that doesn't dictate how
they necessarily need to go

01:01:57.740 --> 01:02:04.980
and how you necessarily need
for them to be better, right?

01:02:04.980 --> 01:02:06.280
&gt;&gt; Thayse Lina: Thank you.

01:02:06.280 --> 01:02:07.580
&gt;&gt; Patricia Vieira:
Okay, thank you.

01:02:07.580 --> 01:02:08.880
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

01:02:08.880 --> 01:02:10.180
&gt;&gt; Patricia Vieira: Thank you.
