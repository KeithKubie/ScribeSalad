00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:01.230
- [Instructor] What we're
going to do in this video

00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:05.770
is think about optimal decision
making by rational agents.

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:08.860
And it's just thinking
about how would a logical,

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:11.430
someone with a lot of reasoning ability,

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:12.950
make optimal decisions,

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:16.360
make the best decisions for themselves?

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:19.860
Well they would look at the
costs and benefits of a decision

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:23.130
and they would try to do
the action that maximizes

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.790
the difference between benefits and costs.

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:28.500
So they would wanna maximize benefits,

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.740
benefits minus costs.

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.750
And this is an important
idea because I think

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.830
all of us would like
to be rational agents,

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:40.810
logical agents, making optimal decisions.

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:43.430
Now when we think about
benefits and costs,

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:45.670
benefits you might try
to quantify it somehow,

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:46.860
maybe in terms of dollars.

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.026
What's the benefit of say going to a movie

00:00:49.026 --> 00:00:51.220
or having some ice cream?

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:54.190
And costs, we tend to
associate with a price,

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:57.540
the cost of going to a
movie say might be $10.

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:01.080
Those types of things are
known as explicit costs,

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:04.090
when there's an explicit
price associated with it.

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:08.020
But there's also something
known as implicit costs,

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:12.490
and the most well-defined implicit cost

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:15.690
is the idea of an opportunity cost.

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:18.720
And the opportunity cost in economic terms

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.720
is defined as the cost of
the next best alternative.

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.360
So if I'm going to go to
a movie, there might be

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.630
the explicit costs of
paying for the movie,

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.290
but then there's the implicit cost.

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:34.670
Maybe if I'm going to a movie,
that time I could've used

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:35.720
for something else.

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.090
Maybe I could've earned money somehow.

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:41.130
And so a rational actor
would consider both of those

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.200
and then compare them to the
benefit of going to the movie,

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.360
and if that's what
maximizes the difference

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:48.510
between benefits and
costs, well they might

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:50.150
decide to do that.

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:52.170
Now to make this a
little bit more tangible,

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.763
let's look at that exact example.

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:58.830
So right over here, we are told,

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:01.890
suppose you have the choice
between going to a movie

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.970
for three hours versus
working for three hours.

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:07.480
Movie tickets cost $10.

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:11.137
If you work, you can earn
$30 an hour mowing lawns,

00:02:11.137 --> 00:02:14.800
$12 an hour working in an ice cream shop,

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:18.190
or $10 an hour weeding your aunt's garden.

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:21.160
What is the opportunity
cost of going to a movie

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:22.120
for three hours?

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.150
And what is the total cost?

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.900
So pause this video and see
if you can figure that out.

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:29.950
All right well we just have
to go back to the definition.

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:31.640
The opportunity cost is the cost

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:34.240
of the next best alternative.

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:39.200
So what is the next best
alternative to going to the movie?

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.130
Well, I can make the most
money if I am mowing lawns,

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:45.100
if I am mowing lawns.

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:49.100
And so my opportunity cost
is going to be $30 an hour,

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:52.020
and if I'm going to a movie,
that would've been three hours

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:54.570
that I would not have
been able to mow lawns.

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:56.870
And so my opportunity cost, I'll write OC,

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.580
I'm not talking about Orange County,

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:02.957
the opportunity cost right
over here is going to be

00:03:02.957 --> 00:03:05.370
$30 an hour times three hours,

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:09.767
so 30 times three, which
is going to be a $90,

00:03:09.767 --> 00:03:12.370
$90 opportunity cost.

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:14.220
Now some of you might be
saying, well what about

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.990
the $12 an hour for an ice
cream shop or $10 an hour

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:19.520
for weeding your aunt's garden?

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:21.680
Well, those weren't the
next best alternative.

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:25.020
The next best alternative
was mowing the lawn.

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:26.640
Some people might be confused and say,

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:29.000
okay I'm gonna add all of
these together per hour

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.140
and multiply by three, but
you're not gonna be able

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:32.440
to do all three of these things.

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.720
You're going to have to pick one of them.

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:38.160
And we're assuming that maybe
there aren't any extra costs

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:42.350
that are not, maybe you get
extra tired from mowing lawns

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:44.410
versus working in an ice cream shop,

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:45.760
but we're trying to simplify things,

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:48.530
so let's not get overly
complicated right now.

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:51.730
So at a very face level
or at a high level,

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:53.350
the next best alternative

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:56.300
is making $30 an hour mowing lawns.

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:58.370
So that would be the opportunity cost.

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:00.270
Now what would be the total cost?

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:04.910
Well the total cost would be
the sum of the implicit costs,

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:07.880
which is opportunity cost
is an example of that,

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:09.810
plus the explicit cost.

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:12.120
So the implicit costs, we
already talked about that,

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:13.293
that is $90.

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:17.270
That's the cost of not,
that's the opportunity cost

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:18.960
of not mowing lawns.

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:22.400
And then to that you're
gonna add the explicit cost

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:23.780
of just the price of the movie ticket.

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:26.580
For $10 you get to watch
a movie for three hours.

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:28.740
So there's a $10 explicit cost.

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:32.880
So the total cost of going
to the movie is $100.

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:35.610
And so how would an optimal decision

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:38.250
or how would a rational
agent use this information

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:40.130
to make an optimal decision?

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:42.650
Well they would wanna
compare that to the benefit

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:44.370
of going to a movie.

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:46.740
And so if they could
quantify that benefit somehow

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:50.080
and say oh, yeah, the benefit
to me of going to a movie

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:54.430
is $200 and that difference
between $200 and $100,

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:56.910
that's the best difference that I can get

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:00.530
out of all of my choices between
my benefits and my costs.

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:03.330
Well then I'm going to go to that movie.

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:05.540
So I will leave you there
and in future videos,

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:07.540
we'll dig a little bit deeper into this.
