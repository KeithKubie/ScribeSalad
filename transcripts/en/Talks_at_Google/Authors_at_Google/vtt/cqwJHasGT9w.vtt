00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:10.910
CARL: And I would like to
introduce today Dean Buonomano.

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:14.330
He is a computational
neuroscientist from UCLA.

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:16.309
And today he'll
talk about his book,

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:17.900
"Your Brain is a
Time Machine," which

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:22.080
you can actually buy at a
discounted price at this table.

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.710
And without further
ado, welcome Dean.

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:27.680
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:31.017 --> 00:00:32.350
DEAN BUONOMANO: Thank you, Carl.

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:33.980
And thank you all
for coming today.

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:35.390
It's a pleasure to be here.

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:38.170
So I'd like to talk
a bit about time

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:41.440
and the brain and the brain
in the nature of time.

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:43.570
And to get my talk
started, I'd like

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:51.070
to start by creating
a awkward silence.

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:53.070
And I'd like to do that
to make three points.

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.700
The first is that your
brain is automatically

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:57.860
attempting to predict
what is about to happen.

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:59.602
Your brain is a
prediction machine.

00:00:59.602 --> 00:01:01.310
So right there you
were trying to predict

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:02.351
what was about to happen.

00:01:02.351 --> 00:01:05.870
Maybe you were thinking, uh-oh,
he's having an absent seizure.

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:09.140
Number two, your brain is
automatically telling time.

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:11.690
The only reason you
could notice that pause

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:14.990
is because you're creating
a temporal expectation

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:18.650
of the normal average
pause between words.

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:21.500
And that temporal
pause was violated

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.430
and that's when the passage of
time came to your attention.

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:26.930
And that's my
point number three.

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:31.340
You probably became aware
of the passage of time.

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:35.150
The subjective feeling
of time going slowly

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:37.520
because it was a slightly
awkward moment and time

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.200
probably seemed
to be going slowly

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.669
and, hopefully, it wasn't
as long as it seemed to be.

00:01:44.669 --> 00:01:46.460
At least I hope it
wasn't, because to me it

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:48.610
seemed like a full minute.

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:51.950
But before we delve in
to the mechanisms of how

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.860
the brain tells time and the
meaning of the nature of time,

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:56.720
let me already start
off by pointing out

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:01.441
that I've used the word time
a number of times in this talk

00:02:01.441 --> 00:02:01.940
already.

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:03.860
And I assume you
know what I mean.

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:06.250
And you assume I know
what the word means.

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:08.240
But is that the case?

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:09.620
Can we actually define time?

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.800
It turns out that the word
time is the most common noun

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:22.370
in the English language,
along with two others that are

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:25.080
units of time, year and day.

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.370
So this is an obvious
indication of how important

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:30.440
time is in our lives.

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.440
But it's a bit ironic
that the most common noun

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.550
in the English language is one
that we really can't define.

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:39.530
It's a bit embarrassing,
actually, isn't it?

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:43.160
So this brings us to the
problem, how do we define time?

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:47.400
And people have struggled with
this for a long, long time.

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.740
So 1,600 years ago,
St. Augustine said,

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:52.569
"What then is time?

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:54.110
If no one asks me,
I know what it is.

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:57.110
If I wish to explain it to
him who asks, I do not know."

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:04.820
1,600 years later, the great
physicist, Richard Feynman,

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:07.220
who's not one to give
up easily on problems,

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:09.724
basically gave up and said,
"Maybe it's just as well if we

00:03:09.724 --> 00:03:12.140
face the fact that time is one
of those things we probably

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:13.040
cannot define.

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:15.680
What matters anyways is
not how we define time,

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:18.470
but how we measure it."

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:21.680
But it was probably the
author Douglas Adams

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:24.630
that gave us the most
important definition of time.

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:29.120
"Time is an illusion,
lunchtime doubly so."

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:33.190
So part of the problem is
that the word time really

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:34.527
means different things, right?

00:03:34.527 --> 00:03:36.610
And let me give you this
rather contrived sentence

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:37.750
to make that point.

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:41.620
Einstein's talk on the nature
of time started on time

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:45.050
but seemed to last a long time.

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:48.040
OK, so first the
nature of time, so that

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:49.990
refers to the physics of time.

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:54.590
Is time a full blown dimension,
as in the four dimensions

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:55.090
of time?

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:57.250
Does only the present exist?

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:01.090
Is time a abstraction
that we scientists

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:03.550
use to help us
understand the universe?

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:06.280
Second, started on
time, that's clock time.

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:08.380
That's the easiest
time to define, right?

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:11.020
That's time as defined
as what clocks tell.

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:12.960
As circular as
that definition is,

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:15.310
it's a really useful one and
probably the most important

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:18.880
in that it got all
of us here on time.

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:21.490
The last one is the
subjective feeling of time.

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:23.860
So it seemed to
last a long time.

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:28.730
And that's tightly linked to
the problem of consciousness.

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:31.660
So in that sense, the
subjective sense of time

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:36.340
is also a very difficult
problem to address.

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:42.670
Now starting with
the first question,

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:45.340
time is really important
to how the brain works.

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:47.380
And this is why I
consider, in many ways,

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:49.930
the brain to be, if you
will, a time machine.

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:51.370
And there's four
reasons for that.

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:53.740
The brain is a machine
that tells time.

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:56.050
The brain generates
the subjective feeling

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:57.730
of the passage of time.

00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:59.800
The brain attempts to
predict the future.

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:05.300
The brain remembers the past
in order to predict the future.

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:10.382
And finally, the brain allows
us to mentally project ourselves

00:05:10.382 --> 00:05:12.090
into the past or the
future, something we

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:13.620
call Mental Time Travel.

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:18.430
And this is really
important for our ability

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:21.970
to interact with
the world, in terms

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:24.700
of what makes humans
unique is our ability

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:26.320
to engage in mental time travel.

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:27.970
And we'll talk a
bit more about this.

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:30.160
But first, consider
the first issue here,

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:31.690
the brain is a time machine.

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:36.190
So the brain tells time
across 12 orders of magnitude,

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:41.170
from microseconds at the lower
end over there to down here,

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:44.020
which you're using right
now, for sound localization.

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:47.140
So your brain picks up
the tens or hundreds

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:49.780
of micro-seconds delays
it takes sound to arrive

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:53.020
from my left ear to my right
ear by picking up the delta t's,

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:56.140
the relative time delays there.

00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:59.950
Time perception and
speech, on the order

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:02.050
of hundreds of
milliseconds and seconds,

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:05.770
music, motor coordination
is happening on this range

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:06.820
of time perception.

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:08.570
And we'll delve more into that.

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:11.607
And then we have
time estimation,

00:06:11.607 --> 00:06:13.690
which is sort of what most
people think of when we

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:15.140
talk about their sense of time.

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:19.570
How long has this
talk been lasting?

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:22.480
How long has the red light
been waiting to change?

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:23.197
And so forth.

00:06:23.197 --> 00:06:25.030
And finally, you have
your circadian rhythms

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:26.738
that everybody is
familiar with, in terms

00:06:26.738 --> 00:06:29.950
of controlling your clock,
when to get up in the morning,

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:31.870
and when to go to bed.

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:33.890
So how does the brain tell time?

00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:38.557
So to answer that question, it's
useful to think about timing

00:06:38.557 --> 00:06:39.640
in these different scales.

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:42.670
So for example, in language,
a couple of examples

00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:47.260
here are if I say something
like, they gave her cat food

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:49.490
or they gave her cat food.

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:52.300
So there you're using
the pause in speech

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:56.296
to determine the
meaning of the sentence.

00:06:56.296 --> 00:06:57.670
And by the way,
this is something

00:06:57.670 --> 00:07:02.320
that artificial speech systems
still struggle with a bit.

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:04.050
This is one of the
challenges and it's

00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:06.040
the cause of some
of the mistakes

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:09.800
that are still made, even with
the most advanced systems.

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:13.810
Now another example
here is in music.

00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:19.420
And now I'm going to play
to you a piece of music.

00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:22.540
And the task here is it's
a hybrid piece of music

00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:24.580
and see if it reminds
you of anything.

00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:25.970
But the time has been altered.

00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:27.710
And I know some of you
were here at the beginning

00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:29.540
and you probably saw
the next slide here.

00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:31.160
So you're going
have to keep quiet.

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:35.186
But Google, please
play music here.

00:07:35.186 --> 00:07:37.531
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:07:40.350 --> 00:07:42.980
So does this remind you of any
piece of music you know of?

00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:45.806
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:07:50.050 --> 00:07:51.520
So I'll give you a hint.

00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:53.260
You guys are a
young crowd but it's

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:56.435
from a group called the Beatles.

00:07:56.435 --> 00:07:58.810
Does it remind anybody, does
that ring a bell to anybody?

00:07:58.810 --> 00:08:00.738
Can anybody pick
up what that was?

00:08:00.738 --> 00:08:01.238
Yeah?

00:08:01.238 --> 00:08:02.720
AUDIENCE: Yellow Submarine.

00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:04.170
DEAN BUONOMANO: OK, very good.

00:08:04.170 --> 00:08:05.190
Anything else?

00:08:05.190 --> 00:08:08.620
Anybody else, does it remind
you of any other song?

00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:10.730
So that's a hybrid song there.

00:08:10.730 --> 00:08:14.145
So what that was was
the notes, so you

00:08:14.145 --> 00:08:17.440
were paying more attention
to the notes, the melody,

00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:20.800
of Yellow Submarine, but it
was the timing of Yesterday.

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:23.140
So we sort of did
a hybrid crossing

00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:26.630
of the spatial information
and the temporal information.

00:08:26.630 --> 00:08:28.219
So sometimes people
pick up a bit more

00:08:28.219 --> 00:08:30.010
on the temporal structure,
sometimes people

00:08:30.010 --> 00:08:31.810
pick up more on the melody.

00:08:31.810 --> 00:08:33.730
But this is just to
make the obvious point

00:08:33.730 --> 00:08:39.429
that, without time and ability
to perceive and tell time,

00:08:39.429 --> 00:08:41.020
music, of course,
wouldn't exist.

00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:44.410
And indeed, it's in
this scale of tens

00:08:44.410 --> 00:08:49.490
to hundreds of milliseconds
that time is most important.

00:08:49.490 --> 00:08:53.630
So in the context of
the lab, for example,

00:08:53.630 --> 00:08:55.724
one question we ask is
whatever the mechanisms

00:08:55.724 --> 00:08:57.640
within your brain that
allow you to tell time,

00:08:57.640 --> 00:09:00.310
can they improve with practice?

00:09:00.310 --> 00:09:02.800
So we often ask
in studies, where

00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:04.890
we do an internal
discrimination studies,

00:09:04.890 --> 00:09:07.880
to tell us is the first or
second interval the longest?

00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:10.444
Google, please play music.

00:09:10.444 --> 00:09:12.280
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:14.530
So there's a simple interval
discrimination task.

00:09:14.530 --> 00:09:16.840
And the question is, was
the first or second longest?

00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:18.400
And the first was
100 milliseconds

00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:21.100
and the second interval
was 150 milliseconds.

00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:24.130
Now, if you have some
timer in your brain

00:09:24.130 --> 00:09:26.932
that's fixed like a watch,
maybe it doesn't matter.

00:09:26.932 --> 00:09:28.390
Maybe you can't
get better at that.

00:09:28.390 --> 00:09:31.750
But if you practice and
that timer improves,

00:09:31.750 --> 00:09:33.700
then you should be
able to pick that up.

00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:34.900
And we do.

00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:40.700
And we can tell here that in
the 100 millisecond case, that's

00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:43.370
what you just heard,
people improve dramatically

00:09:43.370 --> 00:09:45.140
with practice.

00:09:45.140 --> 00:09:47.540
But interestingly, if you
had a clock in your brain

00:09:47.540 --> 00:09:50.540
that was your master
clock, and that clock

00:09:50.540 --> 00:09:52.750
with somehow improving,
you should get better

00:09:52.750 --> 00:09:53.519
at all intervals.

00:09:53.519 --> 00:09:56.060
So you should also get better
at the 50 millisecond interval,

00:09:56.060 --> 00:09:58.610
the 200 millisecond interval,
or the 500 millisecond.

00:09:58.610 --> 00:09:59.780
But you don't.

00:09:59.780 --> 00:10:01.340
So this is a bit strange.

00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:04.130
It's almost as if you have
multiple clocks in your brain.

00:10:04.130 --> 00:10:06.170
You have an array
of different clocks

00:10:06.170 --> 00:10:10.340
that can tell time across
different time ranges.

00:10:10.340 --> 00:10:12.800
So how does the brain do that?

00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:18.180
Or what parts of the brain
are responsible for time?

00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:20.600
Fortunately, we know exactly
what part of the brain

00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:21.560
tells time.

00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:23.710
And that's this part
right here, right

00:10:23.710 --> 00:10:27.650
beside locality and music,
conveniently located.

00:10:27.650 --> 00:10:30.150
This, of course, is nonsense.

00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:33.230
But this phrenological
view of time,

00:10:33.230 --> 00:10:37.001
nevertheless, is surprisingly
influential in how

00:10:37.001 --> 00:10:38.000
people think about time.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.326
So people do still think
about time, even today,

00:10:40.326 --> 00:10:42.950
in the sense that you might have
a central clock in your brain.

00:10:42.950 --> 00:10:44.690
So the office of this
faculty is to mark

00:10:44.690 --> 00:10:46.500
the passage of time,
duration, succession

00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:47.810
of events, et cetera.

00:10:47.810 --> 00:10:49.680
It also remembers dates,
keeps correct time

00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:51.365
in music and
dancing, and induces

00:10:51.365 --> 00:10:54.680
to punctuality in the
fulfillment of engagement.

00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:56.120
So this is an
extreme view of what

00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:59.580
you'd call a central clock, or
a master clock, in your brain.

00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:01.130
We know that this
is not correct.

00:11:01.130 --> 00:11:03.380
The brain has multiple
ways to tell time,

00:11:03.380 --> 00:11:06.260
has multiple areas
in the brain that

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:09.170
are involved in telling time.

00:11:09.170 --> 00:11:11.660
To understand how
the brain tells time,

00:11:11.660 --> 00:11:17.790
let's first remind ourselves how
man-made clocks actually work.

00:11:17.790 --> 00:11:23.090
So man-made clocks,
despite their complexity,

00:11:23.090 --> 00:11:26.750
all work, for the most part,
on an embarrassingly simple

00:11:26.750 --> 00:11:27.650
principle.

00:11:27.650 --> 00:11:32.000
And that's just an oscillator,
your time base, and a counter.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.760
So whether you're talking about
a pendulum clock or a quartz

00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:37.670
crystal or even an atomic
clock, in which you're

00:11:37.670 --> 00:11:43.010
using the period of the
electromagnetic vibrations

00:11:43.010 --> 00:11:45.440
to tell time,
you're just counting

00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:47.460
the ticks of an oscillator.

00:11:47.460 --> 00:11:50.630
So it's reasonable to ask, is
that how the brain tells time?

00:11:50.630 --> 00:11:51.980
The answer is no.

00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:54.980
So as this quote from
Einstein reminds us,

00:11:54.980 --> 00:11:56.570
"Any physical
phenomenon may be used

00:11:56.570 --> 00:11:59.960
as a clock provided it can be
exactly repeated as many times

00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:01.470
as desired."

00:12:01.470 --> 00:12:07.040
So here we have raindrops
falling on a pond.

00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:10.460
And if I asked you, which
raindrop fell first, that one

00:12:10.460 --> 00:12:12.590
over here or down here?

00:12:12.590 --> 00:12:14.840
You could tell me this
raindrop fell first.

00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:17.510
And if we were so inclined
and knew a bit of physics,

00:12:17.510 --> 00:12:19.310
we could even
calculate the interval.

00:12:19.310 --> 00:12:22.100
So the point is that
even this static image

00:12:22.100 --> 00:12:24.690
has information about time.

00:12:24.690 --> 00:12:28.100
And that's because physical
systems that have dynamics

00:12:28.100 --> 00:12:29.117
naturally tell time.

00:12:29.117 --> 00:12:30.950
I mean, that's essentially
what dynamics is.

00:12:30.950 --> 00:12:33.000
Dynamics is the change in time.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:37.070
So the idea is that the
brain uses its own dynamics

00:12:37.070 --> 00:12:38.870
as one way to tell time.

00:12:38.870 --> 00:12:44.390
So neurons are the computation
element of the brain.

00:12:44.390 --> 00:12:49.850
And neurons have their dendrites
and their axons down here.

00:12:49.850 --> 00:12:53.030
The axons of one
neuron can come over

00:12:53.030 --> 00:12:55.460
and synapse on the
dendrites of another neuron.

00:12:55.460 --> 00:12:57.170
And that's where
they make a synapse.

00:12:57.170 --> 00:13:00.890
It releases transmitter here and
creates a bioelectrical signal

00:13:00.890 --> 00:13:05.160
that travels towards the soma
of the post-synaptic nerve.

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:07.370
So if you have these
elements and they're

00:13:07.370 --> 00:13:10.420
connected to each other, one
way we could make a timer

00:13:10.420 --> 00:13:15.560
or a clock, if you will, is
to connect them in a chain.

00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:17.810
So if we had one neuron that
was connected to another,

00:13:17.810 --> 00:13:19.601
connected to another,
connected to another,

00:13:19.601 --> 00:13:21.770
connected to another,
we can now see

00:13:21.770 --> 00:13:24.582
that we'll have this
temporal pattern of activity

00:13:24.582 --> 00:13:27.040
in which one neuron activates
the next, activates the next,

00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:27.920
activates the next.

00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:30.650
So you know that, if
this neuron is active,

00:13:30.650 --> 00:13:35.480
that eight or nine time
units have elapsed.

00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:38.780
So indeed, it seems that
one way the brain tells

00:13:38.780 --> 00:13:42.140
time on the scale of tens
to hundreds of milliseconds

00:13:42.140 --> 00:13:44.840
to seconds is through
neural dynamics.

00:13:47.630 --> 00:13:50.720
And we know this in
part due to research

00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:55.160
on a number of studies, on
both humans and animals.

00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:58.220
And one animal that knows how
to time very well are songbirds.

00:13:58.220 --> 00:14:01.850
So these are zebra
finches and they sing.

00:14:01.850 --> 00:14:04.430
And I won't play
you their song here,

00:14:04.430 --> 00:14:07.730
but this is the spectrogram
of a zebra finch song.

00:14:07.730 --> 00:14:10.340
And not too different
from speech,

00:14:10.340 --> 00:14:14.570
in which this is our frequency
axis, this is, of course, time,

00:14:14.570 --> 00:14:16.460
and these are the
syllables of the song,

00:14:16.460 --> 00:14:19.970
and they can sing this hundreds
and hundreds of times pretty

00:14:19.970 --> 00:14:22.190
faithfully, where you
could almost overlay

00:14:22.190 --> 00:14:24.590
each song on top of each other.

00:14:24.590 --> 00:14:28.670
When scientists record from
neurons in an area of the zebra

00:14:28.670 --> 00:14:32.930
finch brain, they can record
from many different neurons.

00:14:32.930 --> 00:14:35.464
So here they're recording
from 136 neurons.

00:14:35.464 --> 00:14:37.130
And here we're just
showing the activity

00:14:37.130 --> 00:14:40.220
when those neurons spike
and aligning them in time.

00:14:40.220 --> 00:14:41.900
And so some neurons
spike early on,

00:14:41.900 --> 00:14:43.860
some neurons spike
later, and so forth.

00:14:43.860 --> 00:14:46.170
So you have sort of
this chain of activity

00:14:46.170 --> 00:14:49.890
in which seems to be the brain's
clock, for the song at least.

00:14:49.890 --> 00:14:51.377
So some neurons
telling, OK, it's

00:14:51.377 --> 00:14:53.710
beginning of the song, middle
of the song, and so forth.

00:14:53.710 --> 00:14:57.510
So you have these complex
patterns, it's neural dynamics.

00:14:57.510 --> 00:15:02.270
Now in a more complex network,
and this is a simulation here,

00:15:02.270 --> 00:15:04.170
and normally I wouldn't
show this simulation,

00:15:04.170 --> 00:15:06.060
but here because I'm
at Google and there's

00:15:06.060 --> 00:15:09.390
a strong interest in AI
and machine learning,

00:15:09.390 --> 00:15:13.110
I'll give you an
example of a simulation

00:15:13.110 --> 00:15:18.060
of a recurrent neural
network in which you're

00:15:18.060 --> 00:15:20.590
simulating neurons.

00:15:20.590 --> 00:15:23.010
And these neurons are
connected to each other.

00:15:23.010 --> 00:15:26.640
And actually, Carol,
I forgot, there's

00:15:26.640 --> 00:15:28.620
one more button I'm
going to have to ask

00:15:28.620 --> 00:15:31.940
Google to press in a minute.

00:15:31.940 --> 00:15:33.420
And when you do
this, this network

00:15:33.420 --> 00:15:37.080
is going to do a speech
recognition task, a speech

00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:38.580
transcription task.

00:15:38.580 --> 00:15:42.840
So the network will
listen to a spoken digit

00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:45.330
and then transcribe
that pattern in time.

00:15:45.330 --> 00:15:48.450
So, Google, can you
start that movie please?

00:15:51.310 --> 00:15:54.457
So what you'll see here,
I'll show a point over here.

00:15:54.457 --> 00:15:55.040
COMPUTER: Two.

00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:56.790
DEAN BUONOMANO: So
that's the spectrogram.

00:15:56.790 --> 00:15:58.990
And this is the activity
in the neural network.

00:15:58.990 --> 00:16:01.310
So this is the activity
of different neurons.

00:16:01.310 --> 00:16:02.770
And this is driving
the activity.

00:16:02.770 --> 00:16:04.610
COMPUTER: Five.

00:16:04.610 --> 00:16:07.237
DEAN BUONOMANO: And the
activity here is driving.

00:16:07.237 --> 00:16:08.570
So there's not much hidden here.

00:16:08.570 --> 00:16:10.130
Unlike, say, a deep
learning network,

00:16:10.130 --> 00:16:12.175
which drives a lot of
serious power, of course.

00:16:12.175 --> 00:16:12.800
COMPUTER: Nine.

00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:13.910
DEAN BUONOMANO: This
is the whole thing

00:16:13.910 --> 00:16:14.784
happening right here.

00:16:14.784 --> 00:16:17.660
This network is driving this
and processing this stimulus.

00:16:17.660 --> 00:16:19.910
There's around
4,000 units in this.

00:16:19.910 --> 00:16:21.420
And it's contrast
to a deep network

00:16:21.420 --> 00:16:22.545
in which you have millions.

00:16:22.545 --> 00:16:23.780
COMPUTER: Eight.

00:16:23.780 --> 00:16:26.000
DEAN BUONOMANO: So
that was in fast eight

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.710
and the next eight
will be slower.

00:16:28.710 --> 00:16:30.479
COMPUTER: Eight.

00:16:30.479 --> 00:16:32.270
DEAN BUONOMANO: So that
was a slower eight.

00:16:32.270 --> 00:16:35.920
And the point here is
that by encoding time

00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:38.300
in these trajectories,
in the dynamics

00:16:38.300 --> 00:16:41.390
of these neural networks,
it naturally solves

00:16:41.390 --> 00:16:44.450
the problem of what we call
temporal invariants, the issue

00:16:44.450 --> 00:16:47.270
of how you can recognize
a song or speech,

00:16:47.270 --> 00:16:51.680
whether it's spoken very
quickly or very slowly.

00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:54.680
So overall, as far
as we know, one

00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:58.580
of the major
computational strategies

00:16:58.580 --> 00:17:02.510
the brain has to process time
varying information, which

00:17:02.510 --> 00:17:04.880
is most of the information
you're passing right now,

00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:08.149
speech of course, is
through neural dynamics,

00:17:08.149 --> 00:17:12.859
is through changing
patterns of activity.

00:17:12.859 --> 00:17:17.450
Now we all know that,
whatever the clocks that

00:17:17.450 --> 00:17:21.420
are within our brain, is
sometimes they're inaccurate.

00:17:21.420 --> 00:17:23.990
So there's a mismatch
between objective time

00:17:23.990 --> 00:17:25.940
and subjective time.

00:17:25.940 --> 00:17:29.090
And this leads to
temporal illusions

00:17:29.090 --> 00:17:30.570
or temporal distortions.

00:17:30.570 --> 00:17:34.010
Everybody is familiar with, time
flies when you're having fun.

00:17:34.010 --> 00:17:37.520
And to go back to a quote
from Henry James, which

00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:41.780
was from his magnum opus,
"Principles of Psychology,"

00:17:41.780 --> 00:17:43.310
written over 100 years ago.

00:17:43.310 --> 00:17:45.320
He says, "In general,
a time filled

00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:47.330
with varied and
interesting experiences

00:17:47.330 --> 00:17:50.600
seems short in passing,
but long as we look back.

00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:53.360
On the other hand, a tract
of time empty of experiences

00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:56.420
seems long in passing,
but in retrospect short."

00:17:56.420 --> 00:18:00.270
So some people refer to this
as the vacation paradox.

00:18:00.270 --> 00:18:03.680
You're having fun in
Athens for the first day

00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:08.060
and you're seeing a lot of
new sites, meeting new people,

00:18:08.060 --> 00:18:12.030
and time seems to
fly by prospectively.

00:18:12.030 --> 00:18:15.140
So as it's happening,
as it's playing out,

00:18:15.140 --> 00:18:19.160
prospectively your
estimates of time

00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:20.810
are only a short
amount of time has

00:18:20.810 --> 00:18:22.226
elapsed, even
though it might have

00:18:22.226 --> 00:18:24.320
been a long period of time.

00:18:24.320 --> 00:18:28.620
But retrospectively,
as you look back,

00:18:28.620 --> 00:18:31.770
that's not so much a timing
task but a memory task.

00:18:31.770 --> 00:18:33.780
You're thinking back
of the number of items,

00:18:33.780 --> 00:18:36.030
or you're influenced by the
number of items in memory.

00:18:36.030 --> 00:18:37.740
So if you have a
filled day in which

00:18:37.740 --> 00:18:40.410
a lot of interesting
things were happening,

00:18:40.410 --> 00:18:42.690
you're going to have a lot
of memories of that event

00:18:42.690 --> 00:18:44.760
and left with the
impression that it was

00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:47.070
a long period of time elapsing.

00:18:47.070 --> 00:18:52.200
Now in contrast, if
you're bored or anxious,

00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:57.570
then as time is going
by prospectively,

00:18:57.570 --> 00:18:59.540
you might overestimate
the amount of time.

00:18:59.540 --> 00:19:02.190
It seems like a lot of
time has been going by.

00:19:02.190 --> 00:19:05.460
So you're stuck at
the airport and you're

00:19:05.460 --> 00:19:11.040
on a six hour wait
because of a plane delay,

00:19:11.040 --> 00:19:12.570
and time is dragging.

00:19:12.570 --> 00:19:14.850
You're bored out of your mind.

00:19:14.850 --> 00:19:18.600
Retrospectively, when you
look back over your trip,

00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:22.590
that's merely a blip in
your conscious experiences.

00:19:22.590 --> 00:19:26.670
So because you know the Atlanta
bathroom is only so interesting

00:19:26.670 --> 00:19:29.070
and it didn't store
too much information

00:19:29.070 --> 00:19:34.090
about that wonderful experience
in your memory banks.

00:19:34.090 --> 00:19:37.620
So we have this paradox
between prospective timing

00:19:37.620 --> 00:19:42.480
and retrospective timing, which
in part influences our ability

00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:44.010
to tell time.

00:19:44.010 --> 00:19:47.490
Now everybody has
also known about cases

00:19:47.490 --> 00:19:52.350
under extreme danger
or extreme stress

00:19:52.350 --> 00:19:54.840
situations, in
which people report

00:19:54.840 --> 00:19:56.880
time actually slowing
down or things

00:19:56.880 --> 00:19:59.430
happening in slow motion.

00:19:59.430 --> 00:20:04.740
And so this is a report
of a race car driver

00:20:04.740 --> 00:20:07.500
whose car was thrown into the
air, spun around in the air.

00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:11.530
He obviously survived and
later gives this report.

00:20:11.530 --> 00:20:13.740
"It seemed like the
whole thing took forever.

00:20:13.740 --> 00:20:15.360
Everything was in
slow motion and it

00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:17.580
seemed to me like I was
a player on the stage

00:20:17.580 --> 00:20:20.460
and could see myself tumbling
over and over in the car.

00:20:20.460 --> 00:20:22.110
It was as though I
sat in the stands

00:20:22.110 --> 00:20:24.280
and saw it all happening."

00:20:24.280 --> 00:20:25.890
So here, obviously,
it's not only

00:20:25.890 --> 00:20:29.490
their impression of the passage
of time that is being altered,

00:20:29.490 --> 00:20:30.690
space as well.

00:20:30.690 --> 00:20:34.020
I think this is probably best
described as an hallucination.

00:20:34.020 --> 00:20:37.410
So this is an altered
state in which

00:20:37.410 --> 00:20:41.850
our sense of time and sense
of body, sense of space,

00:20:41.850 --> 00:20:43.140
has been dramatically altered.

00:20:43.140 --> 00:20:46.620
So I think the mystery
here is not so much

00:20:46.620 --> 00:20:48.330
what happens in these
states, but what

00:20:48.330 --> 00:20:50.220
happens in a normal
state that gives us

00:20:50.220 --> 00:20:55.290
our impression of
the passage of time.

00:20:55.290 --> 00:20:59.070
Now this ability to
tell time and perceive

00:20:59.070 --> 00:21:02.490
the passage of time, estimate
how much time has elapsed,

00:21:02.490 --> 00:21:05.190
is not unique to
humans in any way.

00:21:05.190 --> 00:21:07.140
All animals, or most
animals, certainly

00:21:07.140 --> 00:21:09.660
have that sense of
the time of day,

00:21:09.660 --> 00:21:11.670
they have a
circadian clock, they

00:21:11.670 --> 00:21:16.160
can learn when food will
arrive, and so forth.

00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:18.750
What is unique in
humans, however,

00:21:18.750 --> 00:21:21.090
is probably our ability
to engage in what

00:21:21.090 --> 00:21:23.140
we call Mental Time Travel.

00:21:23.140 --> 00:21:28.770
So we can think about the
past and relive our memories

00:21:28.770 --> 00:21:34.140
and re-experience things that
we have already experienced

00:21:34.140 --> 00:21:36.160
and sort of study that.

00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:39.510
We can learn, we can re-imagine
a conversation we had,

00:21:39.510 --> 00:21:42.420
we can give it alternate
endings to test out

00:21:42.420 --> 00:21:45.840
whether we should have said
something different or not.

00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:49.050
But even more importantly,
we can imagine the future.

00:21:49.050 --> 00:21:51.090
We can project ourselves
into the future

00:21:51.090 --> 00:21:53.440
and simulate the
future in our heads.

00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:55.500
And some people believe
that this is indeed

00:21:55.500 --> 00:21:57.540
why consciousness evolved.

00:21:57.540 --> 00:22:00.690
So consciousness is a way
to simulate the future.

00:22:00.690 --> 00:22:04.920
And this is what
makes humans, humans.

00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:08.970
The first person to carve
a knife or a weapon out

00:22:08.970 --> 00:22:12.950
of an obsidian stone must
have had something in mind.

00:22:12.950 --> 00:22:14.700
What am I going to use this for?

00:22:14.700 --> 00:22:17.490
So this ability to
think about what

00:22:17.490 --> 00:22:19.650
this will be used
for in the future

00:22:19.650 --> 00:22:22.050
seems to evade the
ability of most animals.

00:22:22.050 --> 00:22:25.140
So you take one of the
most important inventions

00:22:25.140 --> 00:22:29.040
of humankind, agriculture,
it's a hard concept that we

00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:30.030
take for granted.

00:22:30.030 --> 00:22:31.890
I'm going to plant
something now and reap

00:22:31.890 --> 00:22:34.020
its benefits that are
going to guarantee survival

00:22:34.020 --> 00:22:35.520
a year from now.

00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:41.340
This ability to link
cause and effect actions

00:22:41.340 --> 00:22:44.890
across large delta T's,
long periods of time,

00:22:44.890 --> 00:22:46.590
is very unique to humans.

00:22:46.590 --> 00:22:49.140
I've always wondered if
humans are the only species

00:22:49.140 --> 00:22:51.210
to have figured out the
relationship between sex

00:22:51.210 --> 00:22:52.120
and pregnancy.

00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:55.090
That's a fairly
long period of time.

00:22:55.090 --> 00:22:57.210
Can other animals grasp
that relationship?

00:22:57.210 --> 00:23:01.620
Because it spans periods
of weeks or months.

00:23:01.620 --> 00:23:06.760
Now looking into the
future can be a bummer,

00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:11.560
because the first humans
to really see the future

00:23:11.560 --> 00:23:14.560
and grasp it, saw something
they probably didn't like.

00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:17.320
And this might have been,
by the way, a good time

00:23:17.320 --> 00:23:20.650
to invent religion, when you
first started understanding

00:23:20.650 --> 00:23:22.530
what the future holds.

00:23:22.530 --> 00:23:24.460
And I think this
point is beautifully

00:23:24.460 --> 00:23:30.070
made by Jorge Luis Borges, "To
be immortal is commonplace;

00:23:30.070 --> 00:23:32.570
except for man, all creatures
are immortal, for they

00:23:32.570 --> 00:23:34.030
are ignorant of death."

00:23:34.030 --> 00:23:38.470
So certainly seeing into
the long term future

00:23:38.470 --> 00:23:42.920
is what characterizes
our species in many ways.

00:23:42.920 --> 00:23:47.810
But it also does affect
our culture in many ways

00:23:47.810 --> 00:23:50.610
and how we cope
with what we see.

00:23:50.610 --> 00:23:57.430
Now just because humans
are uniquely able--

00:23:57.430 --> 00:23:59.670
and I'm sorry, there's
a going to be one more

00:23:59.670 --> 00:24:04.030
button I'm going to need pressed
over there for the next movie.

00:24:04.030 --> 00:24:05.800
I didn't look far
enough into the future

00:24:05.800 --> 00:24:08.680
to anticipate this, sorry.

00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:11.800
So just because human
beings are uniquely

00:24:11.800 --> 00:24:14.770
able to engage in
Mental Time Travel,

00:24:14.770 --> 00:24:18.040
doesn't mean we're actually
particularly good at it.

00:24:18.040 --> 00:24:23.290
And so learning to
delay gratification

00:24:23.290 --> 00:24:27.790
and learning to withhold
immediate rewards for longer

00:24:27.790 --> 00:24:31.120
term benefits is something our
species is uniquely able to do,

00:24:31.120 --> 00:24:32.960
but it's also something
we struggle with.

00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:38.260
So here's the gratuitous child,
cute baby video of the talk.

00:24:38.260 --> 00:24:40.300
You can start that, please.

00:24:40.300 --> 00:24:42.595
And this is the famous
marshmallow experiment.

00:24:42.595 --> 00:24:44.860
Will that play?

00:24:44.860 --> 00:24:48.550
Doesn't look like it's
going to play here.

00:24:48.550 --> 00:24:50.920
We're probably OK.

00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:52.810
Just try pressing Enter
or something there.

00:24:57.860 --> 00:25:04.100
That's OK, we'll do without
the gratuitous video

00:25:04.100 --> 00:25:06.830
of kids eating marshmallows.

00:25:06.830 --> 00:25:11.570
So the marshmallow experiment,
as many of you probably know,

00:25:11.570 --> 00:25:15.950
is an experiment in which they
get four or five-year-olds

00:25:15.950 --> 00:25:18.320
and say, OK, here's
one marshmallow.

00:25:18.320 --> 00:25:22.610
You can eat it now or you
can wait until I come back

00:25:22.610 --> 00:25:24.710
and then you're going
to get two marshmallows.

00:25:24.710 --> 00:25:27.890
And this ability to
delay gratification

00:25:27.890 --> 00:25:30.200
is indeed part of what
it means to grow up,

00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:34.010
to be able to withhold your
immediate gratification

00:25:34.010 --> 00:25:34.940
for a later reward.

00:25:34.940 --> 00:25:38.030
And these studies later showed,
these studies by Walter Mischel

00:25:38.030 --> 00:25:40.490
at Stanford, that
started in the 70s,

00:25:40.490 --> 00:25:44.030
and he later tracked down
many of these children.

00:25:44.030 --> 00:25:47.270
And he found a correlation,
a weak correlation,

00:25:47.270 --> 00:25:49.910
but a correlation nevertheless,
with their ability

00:25:49.910 --> 00:25:54.260
to wait to withhold
gratification

00:25:54.260 --> 00:25:59.120
at the young age with
later SAT scores.

00:25:59.120 --> 00:26:04.070
So indeed there's many
pieces of evidence

00:26:04.070 --> 00:26:06.650
that there's a
correlation between what

00:26:06.650 --> 00:26:09.800
we call temporal discounting
or ability to postpone

00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:14.630
or patients with
health issues as well.

00:26:14.630 --> 00:26:22.520
So the major issue
there, of course,

00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:25.780
is that much of what
we do is contingent

00:26:25.780 --> 00:26:30.040
upon our understanding
that what we do now

00:26:30.040 --> 00:26:32.230
has consequences in the future.

00:26:32.230 --> 00:26:37.060
And going to school, saving
for retirement, exercising,

00:26:37.060 --> 00:26:39.850
are all things that we take
for granted but are implicitly

00:26:39.850 --> 00:26:45.070
contingent on our understanding
of temporal relationships,

00:26:45.070 --> 00:26:47.320
of long term temporal
relationships.

00:26:47.320 --> 00:26:51.460
But many of the problems we face
as individuals and as members

00:26:51.460 --> 00:26:54.940
of society arise from not
doing that well enough,

00:26:54.940 --> 00:26:56.180
Temporal Myopia.

00:26:56.180 --> 00:26:59.380
So personal credit card debt,
exercising and eating healthy,

00:26:59.380 --> 00:27:00.760
not saving enough
for retirement,

00:27:00.760 --> 00:27:02.980
are things at the
individual level which

00:27:02.980 --> 00:27:08.590
we struggle with in order
to balance our short term

00:27:08.590 --> 00:27:10.780
gratification with
long term rewards.

00:27:10.780 --> 00:27:14.680
At the more sort
of societal levels,

00:27:14.680 --> 00:27:17.290
failure to adjust climate
change, under funded pension

00:27:17.290 --> 00:27:21.130
plans, national debt, are things
that at the societal level

00:27:21.130 --> 00:27:23.590
emerge in part
because of our failure

00:27:23.590 --> 00:27:26.950
to take appropriate
actions in the present

00:27:26.950 --> 00:27:31.270
to assure or guarantee a better
quality of life or health

00:27:31.270 --> 00:27:33.140
in the future.

00:27:33.140 --> 00:27:37.030
Now humans, as I
said, are uniquely

00:27:37.030 --> 00:27:41.060
able to think about
the long term future.

00:27:41.060 --> 00:27:42.610
So how did that come about?

00:27:42.610 --> 00:27:46.540
What's unique about the human
brain that gives us the ability

00:27:46.540 --> 00:27:49.310
to understand the fundamental
difference between the past,

00:27:49.310 --> 00:27:53.090
present, and future and
to plan for months, years,

00:27:53.090 --> 00:27:55.750
or even decades ahead?

00:27:55.750 --> 00:28:01.240
So some people have argued
that we do that in part

00:28:01.240 --> 00:28:10.540
because of our ability
to talk and use language.

00:28:10.540 --> 00:28:13.880
and our brain's
ability to co-opt

00:28:13.880 --> 00:28:18.970
to the parts of the brain that
are used to understand space.

00:28:18.970 --> 00:28:22.670
The idea is that there's areas
in the brains of most mammals

00:28:22.670 --> 00:28:25.940
that allow them to navigate
and understand space,

00:28:25.940 --> 00:28:27.200
in a manner of speaking.

00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:30.980
And maybe the human brain
co-opted those same structures

00:28:30.980 --> 00:28:33.160
to allow us to understand time.

00:28:33.160 --> 00:28:36.050
And one argument
in favor of this

00:28:36.050 --> 00:28:41.360
is that a lot of the
ways we talk about time

00:28:41.360 --> 00:28:44.270
is by using spatial metaphors.

00:28:44.270 --> 00:28:46.940
So I might say,
it was a long day,

00:28:46.940 --> 00:28:49.280
or I'm looking
forward to the clips.

00:28:49.280 --> 00:28:52.220
Or you're thinking, I hope
this talk ends shortly.

00:28:52.220 --> 00:28:56.240
So we're using spatial
metaphors to talk about time.

00:29:01.730 --> 00:29:04.640
This idea of the
spatialization of time

00:29:04.640 --> 00:29:09.680
is really one of the main
ways we talk and discuss

00:29:09.680 --> 00:29:11.270
and understand time.

00:29:11.270 --> 00:29:14.150
And another way
to exemplify this

00:29:14.150 --> 00:29:17.000
is with what we call
the Wednesday question.

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:18.740
So I'll say, our
Wednesday meeting

00:29:18.740 --> 00:29:21.830
was moved forward two days.

00:29:21.830 --> 00:29:24.110
What day is our meeting on?

00:29:24.110 --> 00:29:29.150
On Monday, or Friday?

00:29:29.150 --> 00:29:32.720
So there's no right
or wrong answer there,

00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:35.190
but it does reflect two
different perspectives

00:29:35.190 --> 00:29:37.310
we have about time.

00:29:37.310 --> 00:29:41.780
So if you view time
as sort of fixed

00:29:41.780 --> 00:29:45.740
and you're the one walking
through time and you're moving,

00:29:45.740 --> 00:29:48.240
then you'd say you
move something forward

00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:50.581
and from Wednesday it
might go to Friday.

00:29:50.581 --> 00:29:52.830
That's sort of what we call
an ego moving perspective.

00:29:52.830 --> 00:29:55.010
But if we have a time
moving perspective,

00:29:55.010 --> 00:29:58.760
you're probably in the Monday
group in which you're static

00:29:58.760 --> 00:30:03.980
and time is like a river
flowing towards you

00:30:03.980 --> 00:30:06.899
and then the meeting
would be on Monday.

00:30:06.899 --> 00:30:08.690
So there's these two
different perspectives

00:30:08.690 --> 00:30:10.910
that people have about time.

00:30:10.910 --> 00:30:13.130
And they just reflect
that ambiguity

00:30:13.130 --> 00:30:16.310
of language and the fact
that we spatialize time

00:30:16.310 --> 00:30:17.555
within our brains.

00:30:20.870 --> 00:30:24.350
Now this idea of the
spatialization of time,

00:30:24.350 --> 00:30:28.160
that time is laid
out in space, is

00:30:28.160 --> 00:30:34.710
very deep in the
philosophical literature,

00:30:34.710 --> 00:30:36.660
as well as in physics,
because there's

00:30:36.660 --> 00:30:40.920
sort of two diverging theories
as to the true nature of time.

00:30:40.920 --> 00:30:48.450
One is precisely this, that time
is a dimension much like space.

00:30:48.450 --> 00:30:50.500
So this is called eternalism.

00:30:53.040 --> 00:30:58.080
Under eternalism, the past,
the present, and the future

00:30:58.080 --> 00:31:00.580
are all equally real.

00:31:00.580 --> 00:31:02.830
Now is perfectly arbitrary.

00:31:02.830 --> 00:31:06.100
Now is as arbitrary as here.

00:31:06.100 --> 00:31:10.070
Just like here is a perfectly
valid point in space to be,

00:31:10.070 --> 00:31:12.790
I'm perfectly fine with
you being over there.

00:31:12.790 --> 00:31:16.460
In time, now is arbitrary and
I should be perfectly fine.

00:31:16.460 --> 00:31:19.240
In eternalism, now is
perfectly arbitrary

00:31:19.240 --> 00:31:22.420
and other versions of me
or other versions of you,

00:31:22.420 --> 00:31:25.580
if you will, are at past
moments or present moments.

00:31:25.580 --> 00:31:27.730
So everything is equally real.

00:31:27.730 --> 00:31:30.460
And under presentism,
in contrast, and this

00:31:30.460 --> 00:31:32.670
is sort of the more
intuitive sense we have,

00:31:32.670 --> 00:31:35.330
in that only the
present is real.

00:31:35.330 --> 00:31:37.630
So the past was real,
some configuration

00:31:37.630 --> 00:31:40.510
of the universe that we call
past and now exists only

00:31:40.510 --> 00:31:43.360
in our memories, was real.

00:31:43.360 --> 00:31:44.500
The present is real.

00:31:44.500 --> 00:31:46.720
And the future, or
some configuration

00:31:46.720 --> 00:31:48.460
of the universe at
some future point,

00:31:48.460 --> 00:31:52.010
will become real based on
what's happening in the present.

00:31:52.010 --> 00:31:56.950
So of course, eternalism sort
of justifies a talk or a debate

00:31:56.950 --> 00:31:59.397
about whether time
travel is possible.

00:31:59.397 --> 00:32:01.480
It has nothing do with the
physics of time travel,

00:32:01.480 --> 00:32:03.190
whether you can
actually do it or not,

00:32:03.190 --> 00:32:07.870
but eternalism justifies the
debate because at least there's

00:32:07.870 --> 00:32:10.390
moments in time that exist
that you could potentially

00:32:10.390 --> 00:32:11.930
try to travel to.

00:32:11.930 --> 00:32:14.350
Under presentism the
talk of time travel

00:32:14.350 --> 00:32:17.410
is a moot point because
there's nowhere to go,

00:32:17.410 --> 00:32:20.740
or there's no when to
go, to be more precise.

00:32:20.740 --> 00:32:25.660
Now eternalism is
sort of, to the degree

00:32:25.660 --> 00:32:29.680
that there is a standard view in
physics, is the standard view.

00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:36.250
And this is in part because
of Einstein's theory

00:32:36.250 --> 00:32:38.000
of special relativity.

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:44.470
So let me just try to
convey, I find presentism

00:32:44.470 --> 00:32:45.670
to be much more intuitive.

00:32:45.670 --> 00:32:49.720
I think it's more consistent
with our experience.

00:32:49.720 --> 00:32:53.950
But we believe in eternalism,
at least in the physical sense,

00:32:53.950 --> 00:32:54.956
for very good reasons.

00:32:54.956 --> 00:32:56.830
So let me try to convey
those reasons, or one

00:32:56.830 --> 00:32:58.550
of those reasons.

00:32:58.550 --> 00:33:04.150
So to do this, let me go
over a thought experiment,

00:33:04.150 --> 00:33:06.970
an Einsteinian thought
experiment, in which

00:33:06.970 --> 00:33:10.120
we have the following setup.

00:33:10.120 --> 00:33:15.250
We have an observer on a
stationary platform and a train

00:33:15.250 --> 00:33:20.920
going by at a ludicrously,
impossibly fast speed of 2/3

00:33:20.920 --> 00:33:24.509
the speed of light, 0.67
times the speed of light.

00:33:24.509 --> 00:33:26.800
There's an individual in the
middle of the train that's

00:33:26.800 --> 00:33:30.880
shooting these space-age
bullets towards the front

00:33:30.880 --> 00:33:33.400
and the back of the train.

00:33:33.400 --> 00:33:36.400
Now if you're this
individual, it

00:33:36.400 --> 00:33:39.970
doesn't matter, because
of the laws of physics

00:33:39.970 --> 00:33:43.060
and relativity, that
you're moving or not.

00:33:43.060 --> 00:33:45.340
So you're going to shoot
the bullet forward and shoot

00:33:45.340 --> 00:33:47.590
the bullet backwards
and those bullets

00:33:47.590 --> 00:33:50.380
have to travel the same
distance at the same speed.

00:33:50.380 --> 00:33:52.960
So this pane of glass will
break at the same time

00:33:52.960 --> 00:33:53.950
as that pane of glass.

00:33:57.430 --> 00:34:00.050
So this person should observe
that pane of glass breaking

00:34:00.050 --> 00:34:01.550
at the same time
as this person was.

00:34:01.550 --> 00:34:05.000
Now here you're the
observer and you're

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:07.910
going to see the train
traveling at a high speed.

00:34:07.910 --> 00:34:10.040
You're going to see
this bullet traveling

00:34:10.040 --> 00:34:12.860
in the opposite direction
at the same speed.

00:34:12.860 --> 00:34:14.659
So this bullet will
have speed zero,

00:34:14.659 --> 00:34:17.400
it will have velocity zero.

00:34:17.400 --> 00:34:21.900
So basically, this bullet
will standing in mid-air

00:34:21.900 --> 00:34:24.690
as the back of the train
runs into the bullet.

00:34:24.690 --> 00:34:26.920
OK, that's pretty
straightforward.

00:34:26.920 --> 00:34:28.770
Now this forward
bullet should be

00:34:28.770 --> 00:34:33.170
going at the speed of the bullet
plus the speed of the train.

00:34:33.170 --> 00:34:35.840
Now the speed of the bullet
is 2/3 the speed of light,

00:34:35.840 --> 00:34:37.949
the speed of the train is
2/3 the speed of light.

00:34:37.949 --> 00:34:44.239
So the sum of those is 1.3
times the speed of light.

00:34:44.239 --> 00:34:45.290
That's a no-no, right?

00:34:45.290 --> 00:34:47.081
We can't go faster than
the speed of light,

00:34:47.081 --> 00:34:48.590
that's what Einstein told us.

00:34:48.590 --> 00:34:50.989
So there's something goofy
that's going to happen here.

00:34:50.989 --> 00:34:53.179
This bullet can't
be traveling as fast

00:34:53.179 --> 00:34:57.470
as it needs to be going to
break this pane of glass

00:34:57.470 --> 00:34:58.680
at the same time.

00:34:58.680 --> 00:35:03.830
So we see the bullet in motion
approaching the panes of glass.

00:35:03.830 --> 00:35:10.370
And the person on the train
will observe both panes breaking

00:35:10.370 --> 00:35:14.060
at the same time, they'll
be breaking simultaneously.

00:35:14.060 --> 00:35:17.090
But the person on the
stationary platform

00:35:17.090 --> 00:35:18.530
will not see that happen.

00:35:18.530 --> 00:35:21.170
And it has nothing
to do with delays

00:35:21.170 --> 00:35:24.700
or the time it takes information
to get from here to there.

00:35:24.700 --> 00:35:28.970
So it is just based on all
those adjustments and delays

00:35:28.970 --> 00:35:31.620
being taken into account.

00:35:31.620 --> 00:35:34.800
So this person will observe
a different reality.

00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:38.520
While this person has a reality
in which both panes of glass

00:35:38.520 --> 00:35:41.844
break at the same time,
for this person's reality,

00:35:41.844 --> 00:35:44.010
there will be a moment in
time where this is broken,

00:35:44.010 --> 00:35:46.110
but that is not.

00:35:46.110 --> 00:35:49.180
So this is taken as
an argument, this lack

00:35:49.180 --> 00:35:50.710
of absolute
simultaneity is taken

00:35:50.710 --> 00:35:55.372
as an argument for the block
universe, or for eternalism.

00:35:58.030 --> 00:35:58.870
Why is that?

00:35:58.870 --> 00:36:00.820
So let me give it again,
run that through you

00:36:00.820 --> 00:36:02.270
with this example here.

00:36:02.270 --> 00:36:06.610
So let's look at this sort
of mini block universe

00:36:06.610 --> 00:36:07.540
with four dimensions.

00:36:07.540 --> 00:36:09.970
But we're going to only plot
two, instead of the three

00:36:09.970 --> 00:36:11.860
spatial dimensions
we only have one,

00:36:11.860 --> 00:36:13.970
and we have this
temporal dimension.

00:36:13.970 --> 00:36:16.840
So for the person
on the train, this

00:36:16.840 --> 00:36:18.560
is their plane of simultaneity.

00:36:18.560 --> 00:36:21.611
There's a moment where
both panes of glass

00:36:21.611 --> 00:36:23.860
at the back of the train and
at the front of the train

00:36:23.860 --> 00:36:25.480
are both intact.

00:36:25.480 --> 00:36:28.150
There's another moment in
exactly the same moment where

00:36:28.150 --> 00:36:30.880
both panes of glass break.

00:36:30.880 --> 00:36:32.740
Then there'll be
another moment in time

00:36:32.740 --> 00:36:35.530
where both panes of
glass are already broken.

00:36:35.530 --> 00:36:38.894
So these are the
planes of simultaneity

00:36:38.894 --> 00:36:40.060
for the person on the train.

00:36:44.730 --> 00:36:48.880
In reality, the person on the
platform is, in our analogy,

00:36:48.880 --> 00:36:51.610
not moving, which is the same
thing as from the perspective

00:36:51.610 --> 00:36:53.520
of the person on the train.

00:36:53.520 --> 00:36:55.030
The person on the
platform is moving

00:36:55.030 --> 00:36:56.113
in the opposite direction.

00:36:56.113 --> 00:36:58.450
So just for reasons here,
this might be a bit easier

00:36:58.450 --> 00:36:59.620
to explain that way.

00:36:59.620 --> 00:37:01.510
So the person on
the platform is sort

00:37:01.510 --> 00:37:04.110
of traveling in the
opposite direction

00:37:04.110 --> 00:37:06.850
of the person on the train.

00:37:06.850 --> 00:37:11.710
Now these planes of
simultaneity don't match up

00:37:11.710 --> 00:37:14.060
for the person on the platform.

00:37:14.060 --> 00:37:17.990
So the plane of simultaneity,
Einstein's theory

00:37:17.990 --> 00:37:20.860
of special relativity
tells us that these moments

00:37:20.860 --> 00:37:23.761
will be the same on
this person's clock.

00:37:23.761 --> 00:37:26.260
So there will be a moment where
the front pain is not broken

00:37:26.260 --> 00:37:28.120
and the back one is.

00:37:28.120 --> 00:37:32.770
So the point is that it's as
if the universe, everything

00:37:32.770 --> 00:37:35.450
that can happen has
already happened.

00:37:35.450 --> 00:37:37.540
And the reason some
things appear simultaneous

00:37:37.540 --> 00:37:39.310
for one person and
not for another

00:37:39.310 --> 00:37:41.900
is a question of perspective.

00:37:41.900 --> 00:37:45.070
So here the idea is, from
this person's perspective,

00:37:45.070 --> 00:37:47.390
these events are aligned,
but not for this person.

00:37:47.390 --> 00:37:51.670
So this is one of the arguments
for eternalism or the block

00:37:51.670 --> 00:37:53.350
universe.

00:37:53.350 --> 00:37:55.600
Now there's a clash here, right?

00:37:55.600 --> 00:37:58.960
If this is true, it sort
of leaves our impression

00:37:58.960 --> 00:38:02.620
of the flow of time
as an illusion.

00:38:02.620 --> 00:38:05.210
Because if everything
has already happened,

00:38:05.210 --> 00:38:09.010
the clear subjective
feeling that time is flowing

00:38:09.010 --> 00:38:12.730
would seem that it has to be an
illusion, in a certain sense.

00:38:12.730 --> 00:38:16.450
And physicists have
long been aware of this.

00:38:16.450 --> 00:38:18.970
So this is a quote
from Roger Penrose,

00:38:18.970 --> 00:38:22.960
"It seems to me that there
are severe discrepancies

00:38:22.960 --> 00:38:24.400
between what we
consciously feel,

00:38:24.400 --> 00:38:26.320
concerning the flow
of time, and what

00:38:26.320 --> 00:38:29.712
our theories assert about the
reality of the physical world."

00:38:29.712 --> 00:38:31.420
Here's another good
quote by Herman Veil,

00:38:31.420 --> 00:38:36.280
a physicist from the mid 1900s.

00:38:36.280 --> 00:38:39.760
"The objective world simply
is, it does not happen.

00:38:39.760 --> 00:38:41.500
Only to the gaze of
my consciousness,

00:38:41.500 --> 00:38:43.880
crawling upward along the
world line of my body,

00:38:43.880 --> 00:38:45.730
does a section of the
world come to life

00:38:45.730 --> 00:38:47.980
as a fleeting image
in space which

00:38:47.980 --> 00:38:49.750
continuously changes in time."

00:38:49.750 --> 00:38:53.290
So they're getting to this
issue that the flow of time

00:38:53.290 --> 00:38:54.610
must be an illusion.

00:38:54.610 --> 00:38:58.600
So this severely clashes with
the neuroscience of time.

00:38:58.600 --> 00:39:03.610
And it clearly feels that the
subjective experience of time

00:39:03.610 --> 00:39:04.440
is flowing by.

00:39:07.450 --> 00:39:13.960
Now the question is if this is
consistent with our experience

00:39:13.960 --> 00:39:14.829
of consciousness.

00:39:14.829 --> 00:39:16.620
Now we don't really
know what consciousness

00:39:16.620 --> 00:39:20.650
is so this is a very
difficult question to address.

00:39:20.650 --> 00:39:24.670
But consciousness
probably isn't what

00:39:24.670 --> 00:39:27.850
it seems to be, in the
sense that it seems

00:39:27.850 --> 00:39:31.510
to be providing a linear
narrative of what's happening

00:39:31.510 --> 00:39:34.720
in the world around us.

00:39:34.720 --> 00:39:37.690
Rather, the
unconscious mind seems

00:39:37.690 --> 00:39:41.410
to be creating this
narrative in chunks

00:39:41.410 --> 00:39:43.900
and then feeding this
into the conscious mind,

00:39:43.900 --> 00:39:46.780
or creating conscious
mind, if you will,

00:39:46.780 --> 00:39:51.280
to create a convenient and
apparent flow of what's

00:39:51.280 --> 00:39:52.190
happening.

00:39:52.190 --> 00:39:54.190
So there's a couple of
illusions that show this.

00:39:54.190 --> 00:39:56.260
It's a bit of a hard
concept to explain.

00:39:56.260 --> 00:39:58.840
But let me just try to give
you a quick example here.

00:39:58.840 --> 00:40:01.390
I'm going to say two
sentences and just

00:40:01.390 --> 00:40:04.300
pay attention to the
meaning of the sentences.

00:40:04.300 --> 00:40:07.000
So the first sentence
is, the mouse pad

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:09.030
was beside the computer.

00:40:09.030 --> 00:40:12.760
The second sentence,
the mouse was hungry.

00:40:12.760 --> 00:40:15.820
So in both those sentences,
the meaning of the word mouse

00:40:15.820 --> 00:40:17.080
was very different, right?

00:40:17.080 --> 00:40:18.940
So I think you're
able to understand

00:40:18.940 --> 00:40:21.190
that in the first case
the mouse referred

00:40:21.190 --> 00:40:24.160
to an object, the
computer mouse pad.

00:40:24.160 --> 00:40:27.730
And the second to a rodent.

00:40:27.730 --> 00:40:29.260
But the meaning of
mouse could only

00:40:29.260 --> 00:40:31.540
be determined by the
words that came after.

00:40:31.540 --> 00:40:35.500
You cannot possibly interpret
that sentence in real time.

00:40:35.500 --> 00:40:39.610
The mouse pad or the
mouse was hungry.

00:40:39.610 --> 00:40:43.810
So what comes after has to
influence your interpretation

00:40:43.810 --> 00:40:45.740
of what came before.

00:40:45.740 --> 00:40:47.920
So this is one of
the lines of evidence

00:40:47.920 --> 00:40:51.190
that suggests that our
conscious experience is not

00:40:51.190 --> 00:40:53.950
so much a continuous
linear flow of the world

00:40:53.950 --> 00:41:00.020
around us, but of a
creation that is generated

00:41:00.020 --> 00:41:05.420
and sort of fits in bursts of
the interpretation of what's

00:41:05.420 --> 00:41:07.220
happening around us.

00:41:07.220 --> 00:41:11.750
So it may be the case that our
understanding of consciousness

00:41:11.750 --> 00:41:15.320
may or may not be compatible
with the standard view

00:41:15.320 --> 00:41:16.370
in physics.

00:41:16.370 --> 00:41:20.720
I think Steven Pinker was
hinting at this when he stated,

00:41:20.720 --> 00:41:23.540
"Matter is extended in space,
but consciousness exists

00:41:23.540 --> 00:41:28.090
in time as surely as it proceeds
from 'I think' to 'I am.'"

00:41:28.090 --> 00:41:31.385
So we have to decide--

00:41:31.385 --> 00:41:33.410
and I think physicists
and neuroscientists

00:41:33.410 --> 00:41:39.140
have to collaborate more
to decide if we should view

00:41:39.140 --> 00:41:42.320
our subjective sense
of the passage of time

00:41:42.320 --> 00:41:46.370
as an empirical observation
about the universe, one that

00:41:46.370 --> 00:41:48.740
has to be explained by physics.

00:41:48.740 --> 00:41:51.260
Or if it's an illusion
in the deepest

00:41:51.260 --> 00:41:53.344
sense of the world,
and thus one that

00:41:53.344 --> 00:41:55.010
doesn't have to be
explained by physics,

00:41:55.010 --> 00:41:57.470
but then has to be
explained by neuroscience.

00:41:57.470 --> 00:42:00.680
How does the brain generate the
conscious, subjective feeling

00:42:00.680 --> 00:42:02.810
of something that
has no correlate

00:42:02.810 --> 00:42:07.100
in the physical world, that
is, of the flow of time?

00:42:07.100 --> 00:42:13.479
Now to address
these questions, I

00:42:13.479 --> 00:42:14.770
think we have a long way to go.

00:42:14.770 --> 00:42:19.300
And neuroscience is
a very unique field.

00:42:19.300 --> 00:42:22.810
Neuroscience a unique
field in all of sciences

00:42:22.810 --> 00:42:24.430
because neuroscience
is the only field

00:42:24.430 --> 00:42:27.760
in which the organ, or
the thing being studied,

00:42:27.760 --> 00:42:29.980
is also doing the studying.

00:42:29.980 --> 00:42:32.760
And this raises a couple
of potential concerns.

00:42:32.760 --> 00:42:34.810
Not least of which, well,
is that even possible?

00:42:34.810 --> 00:42:38.290
Can something understand itself?

00:42:38.290 --> 00:42:43.150
It's of course way too early
to answer that question.

00:42:43.150 --> 00:42:46.210
But as scientific fields
evolve, as they mature,

00:42:46.210 --> 00:42:49.000
part of that
maturation process is

00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:51.910
to progressively embrace time.

00:42:51.910 --> 00:42:54.760
You look at what I would
consider the first field

00:42:54.760 --> 00:42:57.400
of modern science, geometry.

00:42:57.400 --> 00:43:02.440
Geometry is formalized by
Euclid 2,300 years ago,

00:43:02.440 --> 00:43:04.720
it was highly influential
and transformative.

00:43:04.720 --> 00:43:06.790
But why was it the
first field of science?

00:43:06.790 --> 00:43:08.740
Well, it was the
first field of science

00:43:08.740 --> 00:43:12.339
because science is easier
if you can ignore time.

00:43:12.339 --> 00:43:13.630
That's what geometry is, right?

00:43:13.630 --> 00:43:16.420
Geometry is the study
of space and objects

00:43:16.420 --> 00:43:18.430
that don't change in time.

00:43:18.430 --> 00:43:21.760
It was only around
2,000 years after Euclid

00:43:21.760 --> 00:43:25.870
when people, such as
Galileo and Newton

00:43:25.870 --> 00:43:32.289
came along, and fully integrated
time and dynamics into physics.

00:43:32.289 --> 00:43:33.205
Same thing in biology.

00:43:33.205 --> 00:43:36.440
If you think about biology, up
until 1700s, most of the 1800s,

00:43:36.440 --> 00:43:40.840
it was largely taxonomic
and fairly static.

00:43:40.840 --> 00:43:43.690
And then Darwin, playing
the role of Galileo,

00:43:43.690 --> 00:43:46.390
said, hey, species are dynamic.

00:43:46.390 --> 00:43:49.480
They change, they adapt,
they evolve in time.

00:43:49.480 --> 00:43:52.450
I think neuroscience is only
reaching this renaissance

00:43:52.450 --> 00:43:55.330
now where it's fully
beginning to embrace time.

00:43:55.330 --> 00:43:58.930
And realize that the brain is,
in a sense, a temporal organ.

00:43:58.930 --> 00:44:00.610
It's a time machine,
if you will.

00:44:00.610 --> 00:44:03.210
It tells time, it remembers
the past to predict the future,

00:44:03.210 --> 00:44:05.020
it allows us to
mentally time travel,

00:44:05.020 --> 00:44:08.350
and creates the subjective
sense of the flow of time.

00:44:08.350 --> 00:44:11.620
So elucidating how the brain
tells time, represents,

00:44:11.620 --> 00:44:14.500
and conceptualizes time is
critical to understanding

00:44:14.500 --> 00:44:17.980
the human mind and the
nature of consciousness.

00:44:17.980 --> 00:44:19.205
Thank you very much.

00:44:19.205 --> 00:44:22.175
[APPLAUSE]

00:44:26.135 --> 00:44:30.100
CARL: We'd like to answer
questions, if that's OK here.

00:44:30.100 --> 00:44:34.494
AUDIENCE: Hi, I have
two questions over here.

00:44:34.494 --> 00:44:37.670
The first question
is about your claim

00:44:37.670 --> 00:44:40.660
that humans are
unique in the sense

00:44:40.660 --> 00:44:43.270
that we can foresee the future.

00:44:43.270 --> 00:44:45.360
But there has been
a lot of studies,

00:44:45.360 --> 00:44:48.067
like in monkeys, where
they can plan for the day,

00:44:48.067 --> 00:44:49.150
what they are going to do.

00:44:49.150 --> 00:44:54.170
That they wake up every morning
and they go and get some figs.

00:44:54.170 --> 00:44:56.000
If they don't go
for the figs, they

00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:59.090
will just stay awake later.

00:44:59.090 --> 00:45:03.730
So it's kind of a weak
argument what you just made.

00:45:03.730 --> 00:45:05.140
In what sense do you--

00:45:05.140 --> 00:45:07.670
DEAN BUONOMANO: I think, so
it's called mental time travel.

00:45:07.670 --> 00:45:09.770
And the debate about
whether other animals

00:45:09.770 --> 00:45:12.230
can engage in mental time
travel is an active one.

00:45:12.230 --> 00:45:15.110
What there's no debate
about is the extent

00:45:15.110 --> 00:45:17.370
to which humans can engage
in mental time travel.

00:45:17.370 --> 00:45:20.510
So no other animal can
talk about plans five years

00:45:20.510 --> 00:45:23.210
in the future because no other
animals can conceive or can

00:45:23.210 --> 00:45:24.740
communicate about that.

00:45:24.740 --> 00:45:28.090
But interestingly,
the best animal data

00:45:28.090 --> 00:45:30.917
on the possibility of mental
time travel in animals

00:45:30.917 --> 00:45:31.750
is not from monkeys.

00:45:31.750 --> 00:45:34.840
So the monkeys data
is fairly debated.

00:45:34.840 --> 00:45:37.910
The major test people
use there is if monkeys

00:45:37.910 --> 00:45:39.740
can learn to use money.

00:45:39.740 --> 00:45:42.470
Because money is something
that implicitly requires--

00:45:42.470 --> 00:45:43.820
This has no value.

00:45:43.820 --> 00:45:45.080
This has no value, right?

00:45:45.080 --> 00:45:46.130
Paper has no value.

00:45:46.130 --> 00:45:48.650
It only has value because
I assume that in the future

00:45:48.650 --> 00:45:50.640
I can exchange it
for something better.

00:45:50.640 --> 00:45:54.350
So they try to teach monkeys,
apes, great apes, to use money

00:45:54.350 --> 00:45:55.370
by changing for tokens.

00:45:55.370 --> 00:45:56.990
And they can sort
of get it to hang,

00:45:56.990 --> 00:45:58.790
but this is highly debated.

00:45:58.790 --> 00:46:00.590
So that data is
still controversial.

00:46:00.590 --> 00:46:04.400
But the best data
actually comes from birds.

00:46:04.400 --> 00:46:08.540
And there's corvids, scrub
jays, that the best argument

00:46:08.540 --> 00:46:09.210
comes from.

00:46:09.210 --> 00:46:13.460
They can seem to,
if they're always

00:46:13.460 --> 00:46:16.670
exposed to one part
of their aviary

00:46:16.670 --> 00:46:19.640
in the morning and one
part in the afternoon,

00:46:19.640 --> 00:46:22.730
they seem that
they can plan ahead

00:46:22.730 --> 00:46:26.620
by putting the food in the
part of the morning aviary

00:46:26.620 --> 00:46:28.410
and not in the afternoon aviary.

00:46:28.410 --> 00:46:30.860
So this is an active
field to debate.

00:46:30.860 --> 00:46:35.890
But part of the debate
is just one of extent.

00:46:35.890 --> 00:46:40.220
And humans clearly can cross
years and centuries that other

00:46:40.220 --> 00:46:41.050
animals can't.

00:46:41.050 --> 00:46:43.450
AUDIENCE: OK,
another question, you

00:46:43.450 --> 00:46:46.570
were mentioning
this kind of view

00:46:46.570 --> 00:46:51.410
between the physical
explanation and

00:46:51.410 --> 00:46:55.200
the psychological explanation of
where we stand with time as we

00:46:55.200 --> 00:46:56.730
move forward.

00:46:56.730 --> 00:46:58.620
But there is like
a physical sense

00:46:58.620 --> 00:47:00.310
where you can put
an arrow of time

00:47:00.310 --> 00:47:04.640
and this [INAUDIBLE]
entropy, like [INAUDIBLE].

00:47:04.640 --> 00:47:08.410
So there is like an
objective physical sense

00:47:08.410 --> 00:47:12.540
that you can say that the pace
of time that moves forward.

00:47:12.540 --> 00:47:14.630
It's not an acknowledgement.

00:47:14.630 --> 00:47:18.080
DEAN BUONOMANO: So in
the block universe,

00:47:18.080 --> 00:47:19.730
everything is already laid out.

00:47:19.730 --> 00:47:22.760
But there's still
an arrow of time

00:47:22.760 --> 00:47:25.460
because there's a forward
arrow in which things go

00:47:25.460 --> 00:47:27.680
one way and not the other way.

00:47:27.680 --> 00:47:32.210
As you probably know, the laws
of physics are time asymmetric.

00:47:32.210 --> 00:47:35.180
You can run Newton's equations
or Einstein's equations or even

00:47:35.180 --> 00:47:37.340
Schrodinger's equation
forwards or backwards.

00:47:37.340 --> 00:47:38.510
There's no time.

00:47:38.510 --> 00:47:42.770
So the typical explanation
to address the arrow of time

00:47:42.770 --> 00:47:45.650
is, as you brought up,
the entropic arrow,

00:47:45.650 --> 00:47:46.950
that entropy increases.

00:47:46.950 --> 00:47:50.120
Now entropy by itself
doesn't explain the arrow.

00:47:50.120 --> 00:47:53.270
What it does is just say
it provides an asymmetry.

00:47:53.270 --> 00:47:55.820
The real explanation
comes from the fact

00:47:55.820 --> 00:47:58.700
that the universe
seems to have started

00:47:58.700 --> 00:48:03.340
in a state of low entropy and
from there it can only go up.

00:48:03.340 --> 00:48:05.890
But the tricky
thing about entropy

00:48:05.890 --> 00:48:08.180
is if I say there's a
state of medium entropy

00:48:08.180 --> 00:48:11.410
here, that predicts
that the next time step

00:48:11.410 --> 00:48:12.344
it should be higher.

00:48:12.344 --> 00:48:13.760
But if you think
about it, it also

00:48:13.760 --> 00:48:16.590
predicts that the previous
time step should be higher.

00:48:16.590 --> 00:48:18.890
So the entropic
arrow is sometimes

00:48:18.890 --> 00:48:22.300
called a bi-directional
arrow that doesn't explain

00:48:22.300 --> 00:48:23.670
the arrow of time by itself.

00:48:23.670 --> 00:48:27.020
It needs to be coupled with
an assumption about a lower

00:48:27.020 --> 00:48:28.200
initial state.

00:48:28.200 --> 00:48:29.335
AUDIENCE: OK, thank you.

00:48:33.700 --> 00:48:35.740
AUDIENCE: So first
of all, and I'm not

00:48:35.740 --> 00:48:38.360
saying this to impress
anyone, but I'm an atheist.

00:48:38.360 --> 00:48:44.020
But when I look at the
eternalism worldview, the block

00:48:44.020 --> 00:48:48.700
world, you know we can look at
a person as a baby and a person

00:48:48.700 --> 00:48:53.860
as an adult. And practically
all or all cells of their body

00:48:53.860 --> 00:48:56.890
have since died
and been replaced.

00:48:56.890 --> 00:49:00.610
And that's a topic in itself,
like what makes me, me.

00:49:00.610 --> 00:49:02.550
Like why do I feel like--

00:49:02.550 --> 00:49:08.830
But if I look at the block
universe, as you depicted it,

00:49:08.830 --> 00:49:11.590
and say, OK, space and
time is all there is

00:49:11.590 --> 00:49:14.530
and they all exist
already, then it

00:49:14.530 --> 00:49:16.210
brings about a
philosophical question

00:49:16.210 --> 00:49:20.050
of what links the slice where
I was a baby and the slice

00:49:20.050 --> 00:49:22.940
where I'm an adult to
create a consciousness that

00:49:22.940 --> 00:49:26.180
views both as the same thing.

00:49:26.180 --> 00:49:29.710
Right, so it almost suggests
an additional layer.

00:49:29.710 --> 00:49:30.240
No?

00:49:30.240 --> 00:49:31.020
DEAN BUONOMANO: I don't know.

00:49:31.020 --> 00:49:32.920
I think the question
of consciousness

00:49:32.920 --> 00:49:35.050
is perplexing either way.

00:49:35.050 --> 00:49:37.019
Whether what makes
you, you or makes me,

00:49:37.019 --> 00:49:38.560
me and what
consciousness is, I think

00:49:38.560 --> 00:49:41.440
that's a dilemma
challenge to science,

00:49:41.440 --> 00:49:43.515
whether you're
participating, whether you

00:49:43.515 --> 00:49:46.140
subscribe to the eternalist view
or the presentist view, right?

00:49:46.140 --> 00:49:48.130
Consciousness we can't
explain either way.

00:49:48.130 --> 00:49:53.890
But I think there's a
further challenge posed

00:49:53.890 --> 00:49:56.410
by the eternalist view when
it comes to consciousness.

00:49:56.410 --> 00:50:00.820
In terms of if things
aren't flowing, changing

00:50:00.820 --> 00:50:05.080
in a dynamic fashion, why do
we have this clear, distinct

00:50:05.080 --> 00:50:06.070
feeling?

00:50:06.070 --> 00:50:08.740
And more importantly, what's
the evolutionary function

00:50:08.740 --> 00:50:12.100
of feeling time change
if there is no correlate

00:50:12.100 --> 00:50:13.420
with the actual universe?

00:50:13.420 --> 00:50:15.535
It's not like something,
we perceive color, right?

00:50:15.535 --> 00:50:17.410
Color is a creation of
the human mind, right?

00:50:17.410 --> 00:50:20.490
Because there's no color
in the physical world.

00:50:20.490 --> 00:50:23.006
There's wavelengths of
electromagnetic radiation.

00:50:23.006 --> 00:50:25.630
We interpret that as color, but
that has a very strong adaptive

00:50:25.630 --> 00:50:26.139
value.

00:50:26.139 --> 00:50:27.430
So there's a correlation there.

00:50:27.430 --> 00:50:30.910
So the question is if we
see, if we feel time flowing,

00:50:30.910 --> 00:50:33.146
but it actually doesn't,
what's that function

00:50:33.146 --> 00:50:34.520
from an evolutionary
perspective?

00:50:34.520 --> 00:50:36.520
And I think that's a
mystery that we'll probably

00:50:36.520 --> 00:50:37.380
have for a while.

00:50:40.050 --> 00:50:42.950
AUDIENCE: Hi, thanks for coming.

00:50:42.950 --> 00:50:45.430
So what's the difference
between the mental time

00:50:45.430 --> 00:50:48.370
travel and, like, fantasy?

00:50:48.370 --> 00:50:52.440
You know, like telling myself
a story about the future?

00:50:52.440 --> 00:50:55.150
What I mean is, like an example
is I could tell myself a story

00:50:55.150 --> 00:50:58.960
that I will go to the store
later and it will be open.

00:50:58.960 --> 00:51:00.460
But that might not be so.

00:51:00.460 --> 00:51:03.269
So is there a probability
element wrapped up in there?

00:51:03.269 --> 00:51:04.810
DEAN BUONOMANO: I
think the question,

00:51:04.810 --> 00:51:06.518
an interesting question,
is could we even

00:51:06.518 --> 00:51:09.400
have stories if we couldn't
have mental time travel?

00:51:09.400 --> 00:51:13.060
Can other animals have
stories, and whether that story

00:51:13.060 --> 00:51:17.650
takes place in the future
or the present or the past?

00:51:17.650 --> 00:51:20.650
Later on I'm going
to go to the museum.

00:51:20.650 --> 00:51:23.815
And so is that a story, is that
a plan, or is that a fiction?

00:51:23.815 --> 00:51:27.550
So what makes humans
unique, I believe,

00:51:27.550 --> 00:51:34.270
is that what makes us
creative is this fine line

00:51:34.270 --> 00:51:37.450
between stories and reality.

00:51:37.450 --> 00:51:41.710
So if I'm primitive
man and it's a story,

00:51:41.710 --> 00:51:48.430
oh I wish I could
hunt down a mammoth.

00:51:48.430 --> 00:51:49.180
Is that a story?

00:51:49.180 --> 00:51:50.920
But then you're thinking,
well, if I had a weapon,

00:51:50.920 --> 00:51:51.670
maybe I could.

00:51:51.670 --> 00:51:55.420
So this marriage of the
stories and reality I think

00:51:55.420 --> 00:51:59.110
is probably what's driving
much of our technology

00:51:59.110 --> 00:51:59.890
and creativity.

00:51:59.890 --> 00:52:04.420
It is this very delicate balance
between getting the stories

00:52:04.420 --> 00:52:07.330
just so that it
sounds like fiction,

00:52:07.330 --> 00:52:10.954
but it's fiction we can
create in the future.

00:52:10.954 --> 00:52:12.370
AUDIENCE: Sure,
yeah, I would just

00:52:12.370 --> 00:52:15.085
say we're almost always wrong.

00:52:15.085 --> 00:52:16.210
DEAN BUONOMANO: Absolutely.

00:52:16.210 --> 00:52:18.930
AUDIENCE: Until we've
seen a repeatable path,

00:52:18.930 --> 00:52:20.050
if that makes sense.

00:52:20.050 --> 00:52:23.020
DEAN BUONOMANO: I certainly feel
that I'm almost always wrong.

00:52:23.020 --> 00:52:26.790
I assume [INAUDIBLE]
people are often right.

00:52:26.790 --> 00:52:29.770
But yeah, there's trial
and error and stochasticity

00:52:29.770 --> 00:52:30.820
in there, absolutely.

00:52:30.820 --> 00:52:33.340
And we can't know in advance.

00:52:33.340 --> 00:52:35.110
So if the future
has been laid out,

00:52:35.110 --> 00:52:36.604
clearly we don't
have access to it.

00:52:36.604 --> 00:52:37.770
AUDIENCE: All right, thanks.

00:52:37.770 --> 00:52:40.034
DEAN BUONOMANO: You're welcome.

00:52:40.034 --> 00:52:41.717
AUDIENCE: Hello, Thanks so much.

00:52:41.717 --> 00:52:42.300
This is great.

00:52:42.300 --> 00:52:43.383
DEAN BUONOMANO: Thank you.

00:52:43.383 --> 00:52:46.290
AUDIENCE: Are you familiar
with Donald Hoffman?

00:52:46.290 --> 00:52:48.420
DEAN BUONOMANO: No

00:52:48.420 --> 00:52:50.560
AUDIENCE: He's a
physicist philosopher.

00:52:50.560 --> 00:52:54.634
He's got interesting
theories about consciousness.

00:52:54.634 --> 00:52:56.550
Well I'm probably going
to butcher his theory,

00:52:56.550 --> 00:52:58.860
but I think, essentially,
it's that consciousness

00:52:58.860 --> 00:53:01.055
is the base of reality
and everything else

00:53:01.055 --> 00:53:02.460
is like on top of it.

00:53:02.460 --> 00:53:07.980
So he claims to have
proven that, what is it,

00:53:07.980 --> 00:53:10.740
like everything we
know, everything we see

00:53:10.740 --> 00:53:14.580
is just based on, is
just to be reconstructed.

00:53:14.580 --> 00:53:17.080
Because it was
evolutionarily adaptable

00:53:17.080 --> 00:53:18.600
it was like a good thing for us.

00:53:18.600 --> 00:53:21.799
Do you think time could be
something similar to that?

00:53:21.799 --> 00:53:24.090
DEAN BUONOMANO: So there's
this very interesting debate

00:53:24.090 --> 00:53:26.580
about whether time--

00:53:26.580 --> 00:53:31.220
So some fields or
hypotheses in physics

00:53:31.220 --> 00:53:36.030
are trying to get rid of time,
so say that time doesn't exist.

00:53:36.030 --> 00:53:39.750
And what this means is that
time is not a property.

00:53:39.750 --> 00:53:42.330
They're not saying that time,
clock time, doesn't exist.

00:53:42.330 --> 00:53:45.870
What they're saying is that time
isn't a fundamental property

00:53:45.870 --> 00:53:49.470
of the universe, it's not
like energy or matter,

00:53:49.470 --> 00:53:51.691
and that time is simply an
abstraction, a creation,

00:53:51.691 --> 00:53:52.440
of the human mind.

00:53:52.440 --> 00:53:55.560
The way Ernst Mach put this
is, it's utterly impossible

00:53:55.560 --> 00:53:57.990
to measure change
by time because time

00:53:57.990 --> 00:54:02.100
is an abstraction at which we
arrive at by measuring change.

00:54:02.100 --> 00:54:03.750
And that's indeed
what clocks do.

00:54:03.750 --> 00:54:07.860
All clocks are are just
some weights, some device,

00:54:07.860 --> 00:54:10.830
that conveniently
standardizes change,

00:54:10.830 --> 00:54:14.820
whether that change is the
swing of a pendulum or a quartz

00:54:14.820 --> 00:54:15.570
crystal.

00:54:15.570 --> 00:54:18.900
So the subjective
feeling of time,

00:54:18.900 --> 00:54:22.050
I think I've sort of already
expressed, it's unknown.

00:54:22.050 --> 00:54:26.190
But the concept of
time, I do like the idea

00:54:26.190 --> 00:54:27.720
that it's an
abstraction that we've

00:54:27.720 --> 00:54:30.480
created that's
incredibly useful to help

00:54:30.480 --> 00:54:34.120
us understand the universe
and make sense of the world.

00:54:34.120 --> 00:54:36.466
But it's not a fundamental
property of physics.

00:54:36.466 --> 00:54:39.999
AUDIENCE: Yeah, thank you.

00:54:39.999 --> 00:54:41.790
AUDIENCE: Thanks for
this talk, by the way.

00:54:41.790 --> 00:54:43.037
DEAN BUONOMANO: Thank you.

00:54:43.037 --> 00:54:45.120
AUDIENCE: I had some
questions about your thoughts

00:54:45.120 --> 00:54:51.240
on how our relative
conceptions of time

00:54:51.240 --> 00:54:54.840
are limited by physical
dendrites, axons,

00:54:54.840 --> 00:54:56.660
physical barriers.

00:54:56.660 --> 00:54:59.130
So in a world where
we are able to create

00:54:59.130 --> 00:55:02.040
artificial intelligence,
or even potentially upload

00:55:02.040 --> 00:55:04.770
our own consciousness, or
replicate our consciousness,

00:55:04.770 --> 00:55:12.060
in a world which isn't limited
by dendrites and axons,

00:55:12.060 --> 00:55:15.240
what are your thoughts
on being able to extend

00:55:15.240 --> 00:55:19.650
our concepts of time because
of those physical barriers

00:55:19.650 --> 00:55:20.340
removed?

00:55:20.340 --> 00:55:21.640
Or slowing down.

00:55:21.640 --> 00:55:24.450
So a real person is
existing, there's

00:55:24.450 --> 00:55:27.780
an AI which experiences
1,000 years of time

00:55:27.780 --> 00:55:30.689
because they're able to
process information faster.

00:55:30.689 --> 00:55:32.730
DEAN BUONOMANO: There's
a couple of issues there.

00:55:32.730 --> 00:55:34.650
So those are deep questions.

00:55:34.650 --> 00:55:36.330
One is the hardware
question, right?

00:55:36.330 --> 00:55:39.210
Is consciousness in our
subjective experience

00:55:39.210 --> 00:55:42.210
of time hardware dependent,
hardware limited?

00:55:42.210 --> 00:55:47.250
Can you create AIs
that have consciousness

00:55:47.250 --> 00:55:49.200
totally equivalent to ours?

00:55:49.200 --> 00:55:51.210
So that's a question
that, of course,

00:55:51.210 --> 00:55:52.710
nobody knows the answer to.

00:55:52.710 --> 00:55:54.870
As a materialist,
I certainly believe

00:55:54.870 --> 00:55:56.790
there's no reason
that consciousness

00:55:56.790 --> 00:55:58.770
has to be hardware limited.

00:55:58.770 --> 00:56:02.640
Now that question, however,
is different from the question

00:56:02.640 --> 00:56:05.100
of speed of processing.

00:56:05.100 --> 00:56:08.040
So this question
of sampling rate

00:56:08.040 --> 00:56:11.390
in which the speed of processing
is ultimately independent

00:56:11.390 --> 00:56:13.270
of our notion of
the passage of time.

00:56:13.270 --> 00:56:17.610
You're processing signals
coming from my speech.

00:56:17.610 --> 00:56:19.560
You're doing that
right now that are far

00:56:19.560 --> 00:56:22.980
beyond your
subjective experience

00:56:22.980 --> 00:56:24.180
of the passage of time.

00:56:24.180 --> 00:56:26.010
So the brain clearly
processes things

00:56:26.010 --> 00:56:28.015
that are happening
very quickly like this,

00:56:28.015 --> 00:56:28.890
that's micro-seconds.

00:56:28.890 --> 00:56:31.270
Your brain detects that.

00:56:31.270 --> 00:56:32.910
So even though they're
made of neurons,

00:56:32.910 --> 00:56:34.201
it's an incredible feat, right?

00:56:34.201 --> 00:56:37.099
Neurons have a time constant
of maybe an action potential.

00:56:37.099 --> 00:56:39.390
So if you we're going to give
it a computer clock rate,

00:56:39.390 --> 00:56:41.850
you'd probably give
it a kilohertz instead

00:56:41.850 --> 00:56:46.140
of a couple of hundred
gigahertz, for example.

00:56:48.820 --> 00:56:50.827
So that time level
of processing is

00:56:50.827 --> 00:56:53.160
different from the time level
of subjective experiences.

00:56:53.160 --> 00:56:55.500
Now, nobody knows the
answer to the question

00:56:55.500 --> 00:57:01.110
of whether an AI
would be able to have

00:57:01.110 --> 00:57:03.690
these temporal distortions
of conscious experiences

00:57:03.690 --> 00:57:04.530
like you or I have.

00:57:04.530 --> 00:57:09.280
But I think there's, in a
way it's a wrong question.

00:57:09.280 --> 00:57:11.610
I think the mystery
is not so much

00:57:11.610 --> 00:57:16.860
how time comes to be distorted
in extreme cases of time

00:57:16.860 --> 00:57:18.930
dilation or time
compression, but what

00:57:18.930 --> 00:57:20.550
our normal sense of time is.

00:57:20.550 --> 00:57:23.530
And I view this as just the
flexibility of consciousness.

00:57:23.530 --> 00:57:26.280
You can be conscious of
a short period of time

00:57:26.280 --> 00:57:27.570
or a long period of time.

00:57:27.570 --> 00:57:29.160
That's just a
conscious state, it's

00:57:29.160 --> 00:57:30.660
just a flavor of
consciousness, just

00:57:30.660 --> 00:57:33.160
like pain or pleasure or color.

00:57:33.160 --> 00:57:35.760
So I think that
when we understand

00:57:35.760 --> 00:57:38.460
the nature of
consciousness, the question

00:57:38.460 --> 00:57:40.890
of whether it
seems long or short

00:57:40.890 --> 00:57:44.710
will be sort of a minor
issue along those lines.

00:57:44.710 --> 00:57:49.246
Because I think what we
perceive is a bit arbitrary.

00:57:49.246 --> 00:57:51.870
CARL: Just a quick note, we're
a bit over 2:00 PM, so let's not

00:57:51.870 --> 00:57:53.150
add more questions.

00:57:53.150 --> 00:57:55.964
If you're already in
line, ask your questions.

00:57:55.964 --> 00:57:57.380
AUDIENCE: OK, I
think you'll hear.

00:57:57.380 --> 00:57:59.570
I want to ask about,
what is the difference

00:57:59.570 --> 00:58:05.330
or are they the same thing for
the things like retrospective

00:58:05.330 --> 00:58:08.260
thinking and the
autobiographic memory?

00:58:08.260 --> 00:58:12.800
Or the retrospective thinking is
about a general loss of memory

00:58:12.800 --> 00:58:14.989
or just things about
myself in the past?

00:58:14.989 --> 00:58:16.780
DEAN BUONOMANO: Yes
that's a good question.

00:58:16.780 --> 00:58:20.900
So autobiographical
memory, or episodic memory,

00:58:20.900 --> 00:58:23.190
is about events in our own life.

00:58:23.190 --> 00:58:25.910
And that's tightly coupled
to how we retrospectively

00:58:25.910 --> 00:58:26.690
perceive time.

00:58:26.690 --> 00:58:28.190
So if there's a
period of time which

00:58:28.190 --> 00:58:30.260
you have a rich
autobiographical memory,

00:58:30.260 --> 00:58:32.360
I did this, this, this
this, this and this,

00:58:32.360 --> 00:58:36.410
that's likely to elicit
a long estimate of time.

00:58:36.410 --> 00:58:39.950
Whereas if you don't have
any events in memory,

00:58:39.950 --> 00:58:41.360
that's a short period of time.

00:58:41.360 --> 00:58:44.990
The extreme example of this
is somebody who has amnesia.

00:58:44.990 --> 00:58:48.470
So you can imagine if
somebody has no ability

00:58:48.470 --> 00:58:52.340
to form new episodic memories
or autobiographical memories,

00:58:52.340 --> 00:58:55.750
how could they even estimate
that time has elapsed?

00:58:55.750 --> 00:58:58.610
So there's this very
touching, poignant case

00:58:58.610 --> 00:59:01.520
of a British man
called Clive Waring.

00:59:01.520 --> 00:59:04.560
And maybe some of you
have seen specials on him.

00:59:04.560 --> 00:59:08.300
But he has terrible
anterograde amnesia

00:59:08.300 --> 00:59:12.030
and he seems to be
locked into the present.

00:59:12.030 --> 00:59:14.900
There's a story where he's
writing in his diary 9:00 AM,

00:59:14.900 --> 00:59:16.240
I just woke up.

00:59:16.240 --> 00:59:18.740
9:30, now I'm awake
for the first time.

00:59:18.740 --> 00:59:21.800
10 o'clock, now I'm really
awake for the first time.

00:59:21.800 --> 00:59:23.870
Because if you don't
have that memory, how can

00:59:23.870 --> 00:59:25.370
how much time has elapsed?

00:59:25.370 --> 00:59:28.970
So clearly, retrospectively,
time and memory

00:59:28.970 --> 00:59:29.818
are tightly coupled.

00:59:33.410 --> 00:59:35.810
AUDIENCE: So as you said, all
of our time keeping devices

00:59:35.810 --> 00:59:38.660
rely on oscillators,
or rely on some kind

00:59:38.660 --> 00:59:40.100
of notion of periodicity.

00:59:40.100 --> 00:59:45.129
And so I guess my
question is if you

00:59:45.129 --> 00:59:46.670
look at an oscillation
or a sine wave

00:59:46.670 --> 00:59:49.910
or any sort of any
sort of phenomenon

00:59:49.910 --> 00:59:51.390
that you can
understand that way,

00:59:51.390 --> 00:59:52.940
there's a notion
of symmetry that's

00:59:52.940 --> 00:59:54.890
really important,
that you could be

00:59:54.890 --> 00:59:57.710
at one point in this
oscillation or you

00:59:57.710 --> 01:00:00.800
can be at the exact same
point in another period later.

01:00:00.800 --> 01:00:03.890
And so it gives you that
eternal perspective.

01:00:03.890 --> 01:00:05.400
What if that didn't exist?

01:00:05.400 --> 01:00:08.600
So how would we measure
time if we didn't

01:00:08.600 --> 01:00:10.484
have this sort of repeatable--

01:00:10.484 --> 01:00:12.400
DEAN BUONOMANO: You mean
man-made time, right?

01:00:12.400 --> 01:00:13.276
Clock time, you mean?

01:00:13.276 --> 01:00:15.025
AUDIENCE: Well I guess
what I'm asking is,

01:00:15.025 --> 01:00:17.270
like, is there something
fundamental about the idea

01:00:17.270 --> 01:00:18.890
of periodicity?

01:00:21.896 --> 01:00:24.020
How would we measure time
if there wasn't something

01:00:24.020 --> 01:00:26.475
that was symmetric that we
could always kind of start back

01:00:26.475 --> 01:00:26.840
at that point?

01:00:26.840 --> 01:00:27.570
DEAN BUONOMANO: So
no, I don't think so.

01:00:27.570 --> 01:00:29.360
I think it's just reproducibly.

01:00:29.360 --> 01:00:33.980
You can measure time
by an hour glass,

01:00:33.980 --> 01:00:36.540
it's something that's
doesn't have to be periodic.

01:00:36.540 --> 01:00:40.910
So I think man-made clocks
rely on this mechanism

01:00:40.910 --> 01:00:43.640
because it's an incredibly
useful symmetric one.

01:00:43.640 --> 01:00:45.605
And the best way to do
something continuously

01:00:45.605 --> 01:00:48.650
is with something
that's periodic.

01:00:48.650 --> 01:00:51.020
But you need some
sophisticated counter,

01:00:51.020 --> 01:00:52.950
and that was really
the main problem.

01:00:52.950 --> 01:00:54.860
But even if you
look at something

01:00:54.860 --> 01:00:59.870
like planetary motion, you
can tell the time of year

01:00:59.870 --> 01:01:01.970
by looking at the
positions of the planets.

01:01:01.970 --> 01:01:02.260
AUDIENCE: Well, right,
that's sort of my point.

01:01:02.260 --> 01:01:04.180
So even with an hourglass,
you could turn it over.

01:01:04.180 --> 01:01:04.400
There's like the resetting.

01:01:04.400 --> 01:01:06.358
DEAN BUONOMANO: You can,
but you don't have to.

01:01:06.358 --> 01:01:08.540
You can, but you
don't have to, right?

01:01:08.540 --> 01:01:10.640
You could have a
non-periodic hourglass.

01:01:10.640 --> 01:01:14.780
So I think periodicity is
something that, in our minds,

01:01:14.780 --> 01:01:17.120
because of the success
of man-made clocks,

01:01:17.120 --> 01:01:20.660
is something we naturally
think of as an ideal way

01:01:20.660 --> 01:01:21.450
to tell time.

01:01:21.450 --> 01:01:22.460
And it probably is.

01:01:22.460 --> 01:01:24.043
But interestingly,
and I think there's

01:01:24.043 --> 01:01:25.700
a downside to that,
which is people

01:01:25.700 --> 01:01:27.320
spent a bit too
much time looking

01:01:27.320 --> 01:01:29.900
for those oscillators
encounters in the brain.

01:01:29.900 --> 01:01:31.700
And I think that threw
the field off a bit

01:01:31.700 --> 01:01:34.260
because that's probably not
how the brain tells time.

01:01:34.260 --> 01:01:36.182
Yes, the brain has
oscillators, but it

01:01:36.182 --> 01:01:38.390
doesn't seem to have many
oscillator counter systems.

01:01:38.390 --> 01:01:42.530
So I think these metaphors
we use in the external world

01:01:42.530 --> 01:01:46.220
sometimes can put us back
a bit when we're overly

01:01:46.220 --> 01:01:47.067
influenced by them.

01:01:47.067 --> 01:01:47.900
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

01:01:47.900 --> 01:01:50.144
DEAN BUONOMANO: Thank you.

01:01:50.144 --> 01:01:51.560
CARL: Thanks
everybody for coming.

01:01:51.560 --> 01:01:52.277
And thanks, Dean.

01:01:52.277 --> 01:01:53.360
DEAN BUONOMANO: Thank you.

01:01:53.360 --> 01:01:56.410
