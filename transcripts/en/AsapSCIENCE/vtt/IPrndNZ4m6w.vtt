We all like to spice up our meals, but did you know that

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:06.600
129 teaspoons of pepper all at once could kill you?

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:11.790
Perhaps more concerning is that eating as little as a few teaspoons of nutmeg can induce convulsions,

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:20.189
palpitations, nausea and possibly death.  Of course sugar has also been linked to a myriad of diseases but for a 150-pound person

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:28.139
10.5 cups of sugar at once is deadly. 
 With that much sugar you might also develop some serious cavities, but don't go eating toothpaste.

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:31.859
Fluoride is very safe in small doses and can help fight cavities

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:34.500
but ingesting around 24 tubes with

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:40.980
170 milliliters or 6 ounces each could be fatal.  If you're trying to avoid wrinkles just know that

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:45.600
68 nanograms of Botox is lethal.  It does stand for botulinum

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:51.570
toxin after all.  Of course injections use a tiny fraction of that amount which prevents nerves from firing

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:56.640
essentially paralyzing muscle.  And while you've always been told to eat your fruits and veggies, enough oranges

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:02.939
And you'd be overdosing on Vitamin C. Granted you need to eat about eleven thousand at once to reach this dosage.

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:09.989
809 vitamin supplements would do the same. If healthy food makes you run the other way don't go too fast. 
 Though our bodies can handle

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:15.869
amazingly fast speeds we're not so great at acceleration.  The Earth is flying around the sun at around

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:19.439
1,600 kilometres an hour, and it doesn't faze you.

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.219
But if it started accelerating to a faster speed we'd all feel the jolt.

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:29.970
14 g's of lateral acceleration and your organs would start to tear loose from one another.  Running fast will also warm you up,

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:35.969
but when internal temperatures exceed 40 degrees Celsius, heatstroke will kick in and could potentially lead to death.

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:37.829
Sweating can help cool you down

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.829
but with any extreme heat dehydration

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:40.750
sets in

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:42.340
causing decreased blood flow to vital

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:48.570
organs like the kidneys and the brain. 
 As a result they begin to shut off while the intestines break down and release harmful bacteria

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:56.489
into your bloodstream.  Of course cool your internal temperature down too much below 21 degrees Celsius and your body enters a lethal phase of hypothermia

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:59.759
which causes veins to constrict and blood flow to decrease,

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:06.419
focusing warmth on internal organs until they begin to fail too.  If you're trying to see those internal organs try to avoid getting

00:02:07.629 --> 00:02:09.959
7143 abdominal X-Rays back-to-back

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:16.628
which is enough cumulative radiation to kill you.  This ionizing radiation has enough energy to rip electrons from atoms.

00:02:16.909 --> 00:02:20.169
5 grays of radiation is enough to kill 50% of the population

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:26.408
which a nuclear blast could administer.  If you're hiding from a nuclear blast to be careful of eating too many green

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:30.159
Potatoes in your bunker.  The green color that forms on the skin is actually

00:02:30.409 --> 00:02:34.689
chlorophyll which isn't toxic but indicates the presence of the toxin solanine

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:38.679
which is a defense mechanism against pests.  You might get sick from eating one,

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:43.209
but eat around 25 of these medium-sized green potatoes and your life could be on the line.

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:47.589
What's good for our own survival in small doses can sometimes be lethal, like potassium.

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:54.669
Potassium ions are essential for nerve impulses and muscle contractions, but potassium chloride is also used for lethal injections.

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:58.628
You need to eat about 480 bananas to reach this lethal amount,

00:02:58.629 --> 00:03:02.919
but your stomach might burst before you reach that.  Just remember the dose is the

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:08.709
poison.  If you want more examples of weird things that could kill you check out part 1 of this video.  You can also watch our
