00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:02.800
Alright, why don't you try to impute some

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:06.030
values on your own. Pandas dataframes have a

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:11.660
method called fillna. Which take in a value and allow you to pass in a static

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:17.130
value to replace any NAs that exist in a dataframe or series. You can call this

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.648
function like so. Data frame column, fillna value.

00:00:21.648 --> 00:00:25.810
Using the numpy.mean function, which calculates the mean of

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:28.050
an numpy array, why don't you impute any

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.400
missing values in our Lahman baseball data sets

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.000
weight column, by setting the missing values equal

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.650
to the average weight. Your code should go here.
