come back and give a talk today um so
 

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:18.270
come back and give a talk today um so
I'll talk today about image domain

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:18.280
I'll talk today about image domain
 

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:20.640
I'll talk today about image domain
transfer which I'll introduce in a

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:20.650
transfer which I'll introduce in a
 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:23.400
transfer which I'll introduce in a
minute so I'm part of Nvidia research

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:23.410
minute so I'm part of Nvidia research
 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:25.650
minute so I'm part of Nvidia research
immediate research is collection of

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:25.660
immediate research is collection of
 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:27.540
immediate research is collection of
researchers in blue work on a number of

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:27.550
researchers in blue work on a number of
 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:31.589
researchers in blue work on a number of
things really all the way from sort of

00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:31.599
things really all the way from sort of
 

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:33.870
things really all the way from sort of
circuits it's a very low level of harbor

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:33.880
circuits it's a very low level of harbor
 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:35.160
circuits it's a very low level of harbor
all the way up to you know machine

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:35.170
all the way up to you know machine
 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:38.310
all the way up to you know machine
learning and computer vision our mission

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:38.320
learning and computer vision our mission
 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:41.700
learning and computer vision our mission
is to develop technology through through

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:41.710
is to develop technology through through
 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:44.299
is to develop technology through through
research we have about 140 researcher in

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309
research we have about 140 researcher in
 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.779
research we have about 140 researcher in
11 different time zones and then my team

00:00:48.779 --> 00:00:48.789
11 different time zones and then my team
 

00:00:48.789 --> 00:00:50.610
11 different time zones and then my team
to learning perception team is about 20

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:50.620
to learning perception team is about 20
 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:52.529
to learning perception team is about 20
people and our focus really is a lot of

00:00:52.529 --> 00:00:52.539
people and our focus really is a lot of
 

00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:54.389
people and our focus really is a lot of
computer vision research and today I'll

00:00:54.389 --> 00:00:54.399
computer vision research and today I'll
 

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:57.150
computer vision research and today I'll
talk about some of it and I called it

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:57.160
talk about some of it and I called it
 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:00.840
talk about some of it and I called it
image domain transfer and the tasks I'm

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:00.850
image domain transfer and the tasks I'm
 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:03.119
image domain transfer and the tasks I'm
looking at it's yeah one way to think

00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:03.129
looking at it's yeah one way to think
 

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:06.450
looking at it's yeah one way to think
about it is can we teach machines some

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:06.460
about it is can we teach machines some
 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:10.140
about it is can we teach machines some
form of imagination abilities and then

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:10.150
form of imagination abilities and then
 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:11.430
form of imagination abilities and then
yeah we'll see it's not really

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:11.440
yeah we'll see it's not really
 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:13.290
yeah we'll see it's not really
imagination it's just yeah learning by

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:13.300
imagination it's just yeah learning by
 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:16.050
imagination it's just yeah learning by
example but still can we do things like

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:16.060
example but still can we do things like
 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:18.600
example but still can we do things like
this can we have an input image and ask

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:18.610
this can we have an input image and ask
 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:21.540
this can we have an input image and ask
a computer to translate into what it

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:21.550
a computer to translate into what it
 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:24.000
a computer to translate into what it
might look like say on a rainy day

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:24.010
might look like say on a rainy day
 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:26.550
might look like say on a rainy day
alright so given a sunny day image can

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:26.560
alright so given a sunny day image can
 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.350
alright so given a sunny day image can
we teach it to take this image and

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:28.360
we teach it to take this image and
 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.930
we teach it to take this image and
translate it to look like as if we were

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:30.940
translate it to look like as if we were
 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:34.110
translate it to look like as if we were
taken during a rainy day and you know we

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:34.120
taken during a rainy day and you know we
 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:35.850
taken during a rainy day and you know we
just need to play some function apply

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:35.860
just need to play some function apply
 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:37.350
just need to play some function apply
some function effort that takes this

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:37.360
some function effort that takes this
 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:39.990
some function effort that takes this
image and transfers it yeah to a rainy

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:40.000
image and transfers it yeah to a rainy
 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.350
image and transfers it yeah to a rainy
day the question is how can we do this

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360
day the question is how can we do this
 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.990
day the question is how can we do this
and I'll talk about a whole series of

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:46.000
and I'll talk about a whole series of
 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.030
and I'll talk about a whole series of
techniques that refused to do things

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:48.040
techniques that refused to do things
 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:49.430
techniques that refused to do things
along those lines

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:49.440
along those lines
 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:51.870
along those lines
now you want to ask why would I want to

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:51.880
now you want to ask why would I want to
 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:53.550
now you want to ask why would I want to
do this in the first place right

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:53.560
do this in the first place right
 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.740
do this in the first place right
so the example I showed this is actually

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:55.750
so the example I showed this is actually
 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:58.140
so the example I showed this is actually
one I'll come back to but it's other

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:58.150
one I'll come back to but it's other
 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:00.450
one I'll come back to but it's other
examples of translating one image to

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:00.460
examples of translating one image to
 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:03.150
examples of translating one image to
another with the goal of enhancing it or

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:03.160
another with the goal of enhancing it or
 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:05.100
another with the goal of enhancing it or
changing in some particular way so it

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:05.110
changing in some particular way so it
 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:07.170
changing in some particular way so it
could go blow race to high-res for

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:07.180
could go blow race to high-res for
 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:08.940
could go blow race to high-res for
instance or if a verb Lurie image am I

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950
instance or if a verb Lurie image am I
 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:12.110
instance or if a verb Lurie image am I
going to make it sharp or if you have a

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120
going to make it sharp or if you have a
 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.250
going to make it sharp or if you have a
photograph you might want to make it

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260
photograph you might want to make it
 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.680
photograph you might want to make it
look like a painting or if you have a

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690
look like a painting or if you have a
 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:17.170
look like a painting or if you have a
loader

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180
loader
 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.030
loader
too much you might want to make it look

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040
too much you might want to make it look
 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:20.679
too much you might want to make it look
like Hina my grant image or if you're a

00:02:20.679 --> 00:02:20.689
like Hina my grant image or if you're a
 

00:02:20.689 --> 00:02:22.809
like Hina my grant image or if you're a
synthetic image you might make it look

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:22.819
synthetic image you might make it look
 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:24.610
synthetic image you might make it look
more real or if you're a thermal image

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620
more real or if you're a thermal image
 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.009
more real or if you're a thermal image
maybe you want to add color tread and

00:02:27.009 --> 00:02:27.019
maybe you want to add color tread and
 

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:28.390
maybe you want to add color tread and
then sort the other examples that I just

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400
then sort the other examples that I just
 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.789
then sort the other examples that I just
showed if you had some are a summer

00:02:30.789 --> 00:02:30.799
showed if you had some are a summer
 

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:31.990
showed if you had some are a summer
image maybe want to make it a rainy day

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000
image maybe want to make it a rainy day
 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.789
image maybe want to make it a rainy day
in which or winter image if you have a

00:02:33.789 --> 00:02:33.799
in which or winter image if you have a
 

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:35.890
in which or winter image if you have a
data image can I make it a night time in

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900
data image can I make it a night time in
 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:37.420
data image can I make it a night time in
which and so forth there's lots of

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430
which and so forth there's lots of
 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:39.879
which and so forth there's lots of
application of Nia translating one image

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:39.889
application of Nia translating one image
 

00:02:39.889 --> 00:02:42.220
application of Nia translating one image
to a different domain that's related but

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230
to a different domain that's related but
 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:45.699
to a different domain that's related but
somewhat different and yeah being in

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:45.709
somewhat different and yeah being in
 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:47.649
somewhat different and yeah being in
video the ones we're actually quite

00:02:47.649 --> 00:02:47.659
video the ones we're actually quite
 

00:02:47.659 --> 00:02:49.629
video the ones we're actually quite
interested in it's actually the last one

00:02:49.629 --> 00:02:49.639
interested in it's actually the last one
 

00:02:49.639 --> 00:02:51.729
interested in it's actually the last one
to represent so day to night yeah data

00:02:51.729 --> 00:02:51.739
to represent so day to night yeah data
 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:53.740
to represent so day to night yeah data
or summer to winter summer to rainy day

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750
or summer to winter summer to rainy day
 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:56.890
or summer to winter summer to rainy day
and the reason is if you can do you know

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:56.900
and the reason is if you can do you know
 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.770
and the reason is if you can do you know
this type of translation you might not

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780
this type of translation you might not
 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:01.869
this type of translation you might not
need to acquire as much training data

00:03:01.869 --> 00:03:01.879
need to acquire as much training data
 

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:04.000
need to acquire as much training data
for a particular use case say you want

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010
for a particular use case say you want
 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:07.750
for a particular use case say you want
to train yeah something for yourself

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:07.760
to train yeah something for yourself
 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:09.610
to train yeah something for yourself
driving car right and you've taken lots

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:09.620
driving car right and you've taken lots
 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:12.699
driving car right and you've taken lots
of footage in California which is yeah

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:12.709
of footage in California which is yeah
 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:13.839
of footage in California which is yeah
always funny all right

00:03:13.839 --> 00:03:13.849
always funny all right
 

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:17.050
always funny all right
so no I'm gonna try and train it maybe

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.060
so no I'm gonna try and train it maybe
 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:19.690
so no I'm gonna try and train it maybe
or test it on winter image so either I

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:19.700
or test it on winter image so either I
 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:21.369
or test it on winter image so either I
go out and capture more data or maybe I

00:03:21.369 --> 00:03:21.379
go out and capture more data or maybe I
 

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:22.899
go out and capture more data or maybe I
can take my existing data and make it

00:03:22.899 --> 00:03:22.909
can take my existing data and make it
 

00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:25.449
can take my existing data and make it
look like a severe winter or at night or

00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:25.459
look like a severe winter or at night or
 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:28.750
look like a severe winter or at night or
rainy and so forth so I'll talk about

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:28.760
rainy and so forth so I'll talk about
 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:31.330
rainy and so forth so I'll talk about
two main approaches and they'll spend

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:31.340
two main approaches and they'll spend
 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:33.129
two main approaches and they'll spend
most of the time over on the second part

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:33.139
most of the time over on the second part
 

00:03:33.139 --> 00:03:35.830
most of the time over on the second part
or the second approach so one approach

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:35.840
or the second approach so one approach
 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.309
or the second approach so one approach
is you take examples and then based on

00:03:39.309 --> 00:03:39.319
is you take examples and then based on
 

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:42.429
is you take examples and then based on
this example you derive how an image

00:03:42.429 --> 00:03:42.439
this example you derive how an image
 

00:03:42.439 --> 00:03:43.839
this example you derive how an image
should be translated to another image

00:03:43.839 --> 00:03:43.849
should be translated to another image
 

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:45.129
should be translated to another image
and this is usually called not

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:45.139
and this is usually called not
 

00:03:45.139 --> 00:03:46.809
and this is usually called not
nonparametric so it we don't actually

00:03:46.809 --> 00:03:46.819
nonparametric so it we don't actually
 

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:48.580
nonparametric so it we don't actually
train anything really just base it on an

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:48.590
train anything really just base it on an
 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:50.319
train anything really just base it on an
example and take this example and

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:50.329
example and take this example and
 

00:03:50.329 --> 00:03:53.679
example and take this example and
somehow apply it to our image so the

00:03:53.679 --> 00:03:53.689
somehow apply it to our image so the
 

00:03:53.689 --> 00:03:56.159
somehow apply it to our image so the
function is the translating function f

00:03:56.159 --> 00:03:56.169
function is the translating function f
 

00:03:56.169 --> 00:03:59.259
function is the translating function f
takes an example in it and uses this to

00:03:59.259 --> 00:03:59.269
takes an example in it and uses this to
 

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:01.569
takes an example in it and uses this to
the translation and then I'll spend a

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:01.579
the translation and then I'll spend a
 

00:04:01.579 --> 00:04:03.399
the translation and then I'll spend a
lot of time under learning based methods

00:04:03.399 --> 00:04:03.409
lot of time under learning based methods
 

00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:05.530
lot of time under learning based methods
where we have some training set and we

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:05.540
where we have some training set and we
 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:08.080
where we have some training set and we
learn this function f to go say from

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:08.090
learn this function f to go say from
 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:11.679
learn this function f to go say from
summer to winter so how this first one

00:04:11.679 --> 00:04:11.689
summer to winter so how this first one
 

00:04:11.689 --> 00:04:12.729
summer to winter so how this first one
work well

00:04:12.729 --> 00:04:12.739
work well
 

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:15.699
work well

to style transference actually lots of

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:17.299
to style transference actually lots of
 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:19.089
to style transference actually lots of
old methods to do this especially in

00:04:19.089 --> 00:04:19.099
old methods to do this especially in
 

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:21.430
old methods to do this especially in
graphics originally but now also in the

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:21.440
graphics originally but now also in the
 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:22.839
graphics originally but now also in the
computer vision community is quite a few

00:04:22.839 --> 00:04:22.849
computer vision community is quite a few
 

00:04:22.849 --> 00:04:25.149
computer vision community is quite a few
methods do this and the set up is

00:04:25.149 --> 00:04:25.159
methods do this and the set up is
 

00:04:25.159 --> 00:04:26.709
methods do this and the set up is
usually false you have some kind of

00:04:26.709 --> 00:04:26.719
usually false you have some kind of
 

00:04:26.719 --> 00:04:28.390
usually false you have some kind of
content photo right it's usually a

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:28.400
content photo right it's usually a
 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:30.760
content photo right it's usually a
photograph you want to take it

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:30.770
photograph you want to take it
 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:33.460
photograph you want to take it
and modified to look like a given style

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:33.470
and modified to look like a given style
 

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:35.379
and modified to look like a given style
photo so I can give you a style and the

00:04:35.379 --> 00:04:35.389
photo so I can give you a style and the
 

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:36.760
photo so I can give you a style and the
content folder and now you want to apply

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:36.770
content folder and now you want to apply
 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:39.460
content folder and now you want to apply
this style to the content and make it

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:39.470
this style to the content and make it
 

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:41.409
this style to the content and make it
look like yeah like this right it's

00:04:41.409 --> 00:04:41.419
look like yeah like this right it's
 

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:42.939
look like yeah like this right it's
still the same pyramid or glass pyramid

00:04:42.939 --> 00:04:42.949
still the same pyramid or glass pyramid
 

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:45.999
still the same pyramid or glass pyramid
and now it has a style of architecture

00:04:45.999 --> 00:04:46.009
and now it has a style of architecture
 

00:04:46.009 --> 00:04:49.839
and now it has a style of architecture
photograph on the left so in a way it's

00:04:49.839 --> 00:04:49.849
photograph on the left so in a way it's
 

00:04:49.849 --> 00:04:51.550
photograph on the left so in a way it's
it's quite simple right we generated an

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:51.560
it's quite simple right we generated an
 

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:54.820
it's quite simple right we generated an
output given the input and given the

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:54.830
output given the input and given the
 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:56.680
output given the input and given the
example which is the style photo and

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:56.690
example which is the style photo and
 

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:58.420
example which is the style photo and
that's it now the question is how do we

00:04:58.420 --> 00:04:58.430
that's it now the question is how do we
 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:03.399
that's it now the question is how do we
do it there is a lot of work on artistic

00:05:03.399 --> 00:05:03.409
do it there is a lot of work on artistic
 

00:05:03.409 --> 00:05:04.719
do it there is a lot of work on artistic
style transfer and you might have seen

00:05:04.719 --> 00:05:04.729
style transfer and you might have seen
 

00:05:04.729 --> 00:05:07.059
style transfer and you might have seen
some of this where the goal is to take a

00:05:07.059 --> 00:05:07.069
some of this where the goal is to take a
 

00:05:07.069 --> 00:05:08.740
some of this where the goal is to take a
content and make it look like a painting

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:08.750
content and make it look like a painting
 

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:11.890
content and make it look like a painting
all right so here we apply this starry

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:11.900
all right so here we apply this starry
 

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:14.080
all right so here we apply this starry
night and get you know output of I think

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:14.090
night and get you know output of I think
 

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:16.029
night and get you know output of I think
it's tubing in and now looks like you

00:05:16.029 --> 00:05:16.039
it's tubing in and now looks like you
 

00:05:16.039 --> 00:05:19.360
it's tubing in and now looks like you
know the painting what we want to look

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:19.370
know the painting what we want to look
 

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:21.339
know the painting what we want to look
at today is what we call photo style

00:05:21.339 --> 00:05:21.349
at today is what we call photo style
 

00:05:21.349 --> 00:05:24.550
at today is what we call photo style
France where the input is a photo the

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:24.560
France where the input is a photo the
 

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:27.159
France where the input is a photo the
style is also photo I'm gonna apply at

00:05:27.159 --> 00:05:27.169
style is also photo I'm gonna apply at
 

00:05:27.169 --> 00:05:29.559
style is also photo I'm gonna apply at
this photographic style to our content

00:05:29.559 --> 00:05:29.569
this photographic style to our content
 

00:05:29.569 --> 00:05:31.689
this photographic style to our content
image and there's a slight difference

00:05:31.689 --> 00:05:31.699
image and there's a slight difference
 

00:05:31.699 --> 00:05:33.100
image and there's a slight difference
between the two in the artistic style

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:33.110
between the two in the artistic style
 

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:35.580
between the two in the artistic style
transfer your K or actually you desire

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:35.590
transfer your K or actually you desire
 

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:38.350
transfer your K or actually you desire
to change some of the geometry in the

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:38.360
to change some of the geometry in the
 

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:40.209
to change some of the geometry in the

all of a sudden get bent a little bit

00:05:41.589 --> 00:05:41.599
all of a sudden get bent a little bit
 

00:05:41.599 --> 00:05:43.180
all of a sudden get bent a little bit
right that's that's part of the style

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:43.190
right that's that's part of the style
 

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:44.800
right that's that's part of the style
whereas for photographic in which is

that's not the case you want to leave

00:05:45.879 --> 00:05:45.889
that's not the case you want to leave
 

00:05:45.889 --> 00:05:47.439
that's not the case you want to leave
the geometry alone you just want to have

00:05:47.439 --> 00:05:47.449
the geometry alone you just want to have
 

00:05:47.449 --> 00:05:51.640
the geometry alone you just want to have
the look to be different and the work

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:51.650
the look to be different and the work
 

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:54.490
the look to be different and the work
we've done recently published is EC CV

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:54.500
we've done recently published is EC CV
 

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:57.990
we've done recently published is EC CV
and it's this two-step process

00:05:57.990 --> 00:05:58.000
and it's this two-step process
 

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.290
and it's this two-step process
so we first so we model this photograph

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:02.300
so we first so we model this photograph
 

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:03.790
so we first so we model this photograph
excel transfer it's a closed form

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:03.800
excel transfer it's a closed form
 

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:06.640
excel transfer it's a closed form
function and we applied to function so

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:06.650
function and we applied to function so
 

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:08.830
function and we applied to function so
it's function f1 function f to the first

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:08.840
it's function f1 function f to the first
 

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:12.240
it's function f1 function f to the first
function applies to style photograph and

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:12.250
function applies to style photograph and
 

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:15.249
function applies to style photograph and
and that that's a yeah neural network

00:06:15.249 --> 00:06:15.259
and that that's a yeah neural network
 

00:06:15.259 --> 00:06:17.950
and that that's a yeah neural network
based and it does okay but it leaves

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:17.960
based and it does okay but it leaves
 

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:19.480
based and it does okay but it leaves
some artifacts and then B applies of a

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:19.490
some artifacts and then B applies of a
 

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:21.850
some artifacts and then B applies of a
second function which we call so the

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:21.860
second function which we call so the
 

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:23.110
second function which we call so the
first one we call sterilization ship and

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:23.120
first one we call sterilization ship and
 

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:25.330
first one we call sterilization ship and
the second one we call a smoothing step

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:25.340
the second one we call a smoothing step
 

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:27.219

all of this work it's similar to degree
to the neural style transfer work that

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:35.840
to the neural style transfer work that
 

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:38.529
to the neural style transfer work that
you might have seen so the main insight

00:06:38.529 --> 00:06:38.539
you might have seen so the main insight
 

00:06:38.539 --> 00:06:40.629
you might have seen so the main insight
is or the main assumption that we make

00:06:40.629 --> 00:06:40.639
is or the main assumption that we make
 

00:06:40.639 --> 00:06:43.240
is or the main assumption that we make
and it turns out to be true is that if

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:43.250
and it turns out to be true is that if
 

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:44.239
and it turns out to be true is that if
you encode your

00:06:44.239 --> 00:06:44.249
you encode your
 

00:06:44.249 --> 00:06:46.609
you encode your
on the left side the input image and you

00:06:46.609 --> 00:06:46.619
on the left side the input image and you
 

00:06:46.619 --> 00:06:49.729
on the left side the input image and you
have an an encoder and encodes it into

00:06:49.729 --> 00:06:49.739
have an an encoder and encodes it into
 

00:06:49.739 --> 00:06:52.819
have an an encoder and encodes it into
some space and we just used vgg 19 so we

00:06:52.819 --> 00:06:52.829
some space and we just used vgg 19 so we
 

00:06:52.829 --> 00:06:55.339
some space and we just used vgg 19 so we
use an existing vgg Network we encode it

00:06:55.339 --> 00:06:55.349
use an existing vgg Network we encode it
 

00:06:55.349 --> 00:06:58.189
use an existing vgg Network we encode it
up to a fourth layer and take the

00:06:58.189 --> 00:06:58.199
up to a fourth layer and take the
 

00:06:58.199 --> 00:07:00.109
up to a fourth layer and take the
features that come out of it we make

00:07:00.109 --> 00:07:00.119
features that come out of it we make
 

00:07:00.119 --> 00:07:01.999
features that come out of it we make
this assumption that the covariance

00:07:01.999 --> 00:07:02.009
this assumption that the covariance
 

00:07:02.009 --> 00:07:05.179
this assumption that the covariance
matrix of those features actually encode

00:07:05.179 --> 00:07:05.189
matrix of those features actually encode
 

00:07:05.189 --> 00:07:07.969
matrix of those features actually encode
this style somehow so if you take the

00:07:07.969 --> 00:07:07.979
this style somehow so if you take the
 

00:07:07.979 --> 00:07:11.659
this style somehow so if you take the
covariance matrix now HC is the are the

00:07:11.659 --> 00:07:11.669
covariance matrix now HC is the are the
 

00:07:11.669 --> 00:07:14.359
covariance matrix now HC is the are the
features of the content image HC x HC

00:07:14.359 --> 00:07:14.369
features of the content image HC x HC
 

00:07:14.369 --> 00:07:16.850
features of the content image HC x HC
transpose Y is the covariance matrix and

00:07:16.850 --> 00:07:16.860
transpose Y is the covariance matrix and
 

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:18.229
transpose Y is the covariance matrix and
we make the assumption that those

00:07:18.229 --> 00:07:18.239
we make the assumption that those
 

00:07:18.239 --> 00:07:22.279
we make the assumption that those
somehow encode the style features so we

00:07:22.279 --> 00:07:22.289
somehow encode the style features so we
 

00:07:22.289 --> 00:07:24.769
somehow encode the style features so we
can take the features from both the

00:07:24.769 --> 00:07:24.779
can take the features from both the
 

00:07:24.779 --> 00:07:26.419
can take the features from both the
content image as well as the style image

00:07:26.419 --> 00:07:26.429
content image as well as the style image
 

00:07:26.429 --> 00:07:29.119
content image as well as the style image
and now we're trying to enforce the

00:07:29.119 --> 00:07:29.129
and now we're trying to enforce the
 

00:07:29.129 --> 00:07:31.179
and now we're trying to enforce the
covariance the covariances of the style

00:07:31.179 --> 00:07:31.189
covariance the covariances of the style
 

00:07:31.189 --> 00:07:34.219
covariance the covariances of the style
features onto the content features so

00:07:34.219 --> 00:07:34.229
features onto the content features so
 

00:07:34.229 --> 00:07:36.619
features onto the content features so
that they look alike and it's actually

00:07:36.619 --> 00:07:36.629
that they look alike and it's actually
 

00:07:36.629 --> 00:07:38.419
that they look alike and it's actually
fairly simple to do so we encode the

00:07:38.419 --> 00:07:38.429
fairly simple to do so we encode the
 

00:07:38.429 --> 00:07:40.609
fairly simple to do so we encode the
image didn't be applied it's whitening

00:07:40.609 --> 00:07:40.619
image didn't be applied it's whitening
 

00:07:40.619 --> 00:07:42.169
image didn't be applied it's whitening
step it's really like yeah normal

00:07:42.169 --> 00:07:42.179
step it's really like yeah normal
 

00:07:42.179 --> 00:07:44.059
step it's really like yeah normal
whitening step let me apply a coloring

00:07:44.059 --> 00:07:44.069
whitening step let me apply a coloring
 

00:07:44.069 --> 00:07:45.559
whitening step let me apply a coloring
step which really take just make sure

00:07:45.559 --> 00:07:45.569
step which really take just make sure
 

00:07:45.569 --> 00:07:47.479
step which really take just make sure
that yeah those covariances are the same

00:07:47.479 --> 00:07:47.489
that yeah those covariances are the same
 

00:07:47.489 --> 00:07:49.759
that yeah those covariances are the same
and then we decode it again so it's a

00:07:49.759 --> 00:07:49.769
and then we decode it again so it's a
 

00:07:49.769 --> 00:07:51.469
and then we decode it again so it's a
it's almost like a normal encoder

00:07:51.469 --> 00:07:51.479
it's almost like a normal encoder
 

00:07:51.479 --> 00:07:52.999
it's almost like a normal encoder
decoder architecture except for this

00:07:52.999 --> 00:07:53.009
decoder architecture except for this
 

00:07:53.009 --> 00:07:55.509
decoder architecture except for this
whitening coloring step and outcomes

00:07:55.509 --> 00:07:55.519
whitening coloring step and outcomes
 

00:07:55.519 --> 00:07:58.219
whitening coloring step and outcomes
style transfer image and this is similar

00:07:58.219 --> 00:07:58.229
style transfer image and this is similar
 

00:07:58.229 --> 00:08:03.199
style transfer image and this is similar
to previous work we also make use of

00:08:03.199 --> 00:08:03.209
to previous work we also make use of
 

00:08:03.209 --> 00:08:05.269
to previous work we also make use of
labels if they're available a previous

00:08:05.269 --> 00:08:05.279
labels if they're available a previous
 

00:08:05.279 --> 00:08:06.739
labels if they're available a previous
work also uses this so if we know the

00:08:06.739 --> 00:08:06.749
work also uses this so if we know the
 

00:08:06.749 --> 00:08:08.959
work also uses this so if we know the
sky you know this part of an image is

00:08:08.959 --> 00:08:08.969
sky you know this part of an image is
 

00:08:08.969 --> 00:08:10.189
sky you know this part of an image is
described in this part of this tile and

00:08:10.189 --> 00:08:10.199
described in this part of this tile and
 

00:08:10.199 --> 00:08:11.419
described in this part of this tile and
which is also sky we mapped those

00:08:11.419 --> 00:08:11.429
which is also sky we mapped those
 

00:08:11.429 --> 00:08:13.339
which is also sky we mapped those
together to make sure if we don't mix

00:08:13.339 --> 00:08:13.349
together to make sure if we don't mix
 

00:08:13.349 --> 00:08:16.429
together to make sure if we don't mix
near roads and skies and so forth well

00:08:16.429 --> 00:08:16.439
near roads and skies and so forth well
 

00:08:16.439 --> 00:08:19.029
near roads and skies and so forth well
you get this this so style on the left

00:08:19.029 --> 00:08:19.039
you get this this so style on the left
 

00:08:19.039 --> 00:08:20.959
you get this this so style on the left
content in the middle so we applied the

00:08:20.959 --> 00:08:20.969
content in the middle so we applied the
 

00:08:20.969 --> 00:08:22.759
content in the middle so we applied the
style on the content and we get yeah the

00:08:22.759 --> 00:08:22.769
style on the content and we get yeah the
 

00:08:22.769 --> 00:08:24.289
style on the content and we get yeah the
output on the right I think as you can

00:08:24.289 --> 00:08:24.299
output on the right I think as you can
 

00:08:24.299 --> 00:08:26.539
output on the right I think as you can
see for the top image it looks it looks

00:08:26.539 --> 00:08:26.549
see for the top image it looks it looks
 

00:08:26.549 --> 00:08:29.149
see for the top image it looks it looks
alright for the bottom image it does

00:08:29.149 --> 00:08:29.159
alright for the bottom image it does
 

00:08:29.159 --> 00:08:31.549
alright for the bottom image it does
apply to style of divs this image to

00:08:31.549 --> 00:08:31.559
apply to style of divs this image to
 

00:08:31.559 --> 00:08:34.040
apply to style of divs this image to
this content photo however you can see

00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:34.050
this content photo however you can see
 

00:08:34.050 --> 00:08:35.509
this content photo however you can see
in the clouds yeah they're sort of these

00:08:35.509 --> 00:08:35.519
in the clouds yeah they're sort of these
 

00:08:35.519 --> 00:08:37.579
in the clouds yeah they're sort of these
artifacts are it's a little wobbly its

00:08:37.579 --> 00:08:37.589
artifacts are it's a little wobbly its
 

00:08:37.589 --> 00:08:39.649
artifacts are it's a little wobbly its
overall yes the style is there but the

00:08:39.649 --> 00:08:39.659
overall yes the style is there but the
 

00:08:39.659 --> 00:08:41.899
overall yes the style is there but the
geometry has suffered a bit but it's

00:08:41.899 --> 00:08:41.909
geometry has suffered a bit but it's
 

00:08:41.909 --> 00:08:46.160
geometry has suffered a bit but it's
more wobbly than it should be so we

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:46.170
more wobbly than it should be so we
 

00:08:46.170 --> 00:08:47.960
more wobbly than it should be so we
apply the second step which we call

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:47.970
apply the second step which we call
 

00:08:47.970 --> 00:08:49.189
apply the second step which we call
photo smoothing and it's actually a

00:08:49.189 --> 00:08:49.199
photo smoothing and it's actually a
 

00:08:49.199 --> 00:08:54.939
photo smoothing and it's actually a
fairly simple idea what we say is that

00:08:54.939 --> 00:08:54.949
fairly simple idea what we say is that
 

00:08:54.949 --> 00:08:56.610
fairly simple idea what we say is that
the

00:08:56.610 --> 00:08:56.620
the
 

00:08:56.620 --> 00:09:00.720
the
omit that the pixel in the resulting

00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:00.730
omit that the pixel in the resulting
 

00:09:00.730 --> 00:09:03.750
omit that the pixel in the resulting
image neighboring pixels their

00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:03.760
image neighboring pixels their
 

00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:05.820
image neighboring pixels their
relationships should be similar to the

00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:05.830
relationships should be similar to the
 

00:09:05.830 --> 00:09:08.850
relationships should be similar to the
original image of the style sorry of the

00:09:08.850 --> 00:09:08.860
original image of the style sorry of the
 

00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:10.200
original image of the style sorry of the
content they shouldn't change all that

00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:10.210
content they shouldn't change all that
 

00:09:10.210 --> 00:09:10.800
content they shouldn't change all that
much right

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:10.810
much right
 

00:09:10.810 --> 00:09:12.810
much right
it's ok to apply the style but the the

00:09:12.810 --> 00:09:12.820
it's ok to apply the style but the the
 

00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:14.640
it's ok to apply the style but the the
relationship between neighboring pixels

00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:14.650
relationship between neighboring pixels
 

00:09:14.650 --> 00:09:16.980
relationship between neighboring pixels
should still remain the same and we just

00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:16.990
should still remain the same and we just
 

00:09:16.990 --> 00:09:18.930
should still remain the same and we just
imposed this through an optimization

00:09:18.930 --> 00:09:18.940
imposed this through an optimization
 

00:09:18.940 --> 00:09:19.920
imposed this through an optimization
which actually has a closed form

00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:19.930
which actually has a closed form
 

00:09:19.930 --> 00:09:22.890
which actually has a closed form
solution to really make make sure that

00:09:22.890 --> 00:09:22.900
solution to really make make sure that
 

00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:24.420
solution to really make make sure that
the similarity between neighboring

00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:24.430
the similarity between neighboring
 

00:09:24.430 --> 00:09:28.320
the similarity between neighboring
pixels is the same between the image

00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:28.330
pixels is the same between the image
 

00:09:28.330 --> 00:09:30.000
pixels is the same between the image
that we are creating and the original

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:30.010
that we are creating and the original
 

00:09:30.010 --> 00:09:32.970
that we are creating and the original
one and one to apply this you get much

00:09:32.970 --> 00:09:32.980
one and one to apply this you get much
 

00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:35.400
one and one to apply this you get much
better results so this is the original

00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:35.410
better results so this is the original
 

00:09:35.410 --> 00:09:37.230
better results so this is the original
output again and once we apply this

00:09:37.230 --> 00:09:37.240
output again and once we apply this
 

00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:40.200
output again and once we apply this
smoothing step you get this so all the

00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:40.210
smoothing step you get this so all the
 

00:09:40.210 --> 00:09:42.690
smoothing step you get this so all the
while the artifacts yeah you can see

00:09:42.690 --> 00:09:42.700
while the artifacts yeah you can see
 

00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:45.420
while the artifacts yeah you can see
that disappear and it's much more

00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:45.430
that disappear and it's much more
 

00:09:45.430 --> 00:09:47.430
that disappear and it's much more
similar to the original content photo

00:09:47.430 --> 00:09:47.440
similar to the original content photo
 

00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:49.380
similar to the original content photo
but it has to style from the style that

00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:49.390
but it has to style from the style that
 

00:09:49.390 --> 00:09:52.650
but it has to style from the style that
are applied so let me show you a few

00:09:52.650 --> 00:09:52.660
are applied so let me show you a few
 

00:09:52.660 --> 00:09:55.110
are applied so let me show you a few
more examples and comparisons so again

00:09:55.110 --> 00:09:55.120
more examples and comparisons so again
 

00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:57.690
more examples and comparisons so again
content and style and we applied our sis

00:09:57.690 --> 00:09:57.700
content and style and we applied our sis
 

00:09:57.700 --> 00:09:59.310
content and style and we applied our sis
on the right and then in the middle is

00:09:59.310 --> 00:09:59.320
on the right and then in the middle is
 

00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:02.580
on the right and then in the middle is
two previous methods one is actually 46

00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:02.590
two previous methods one is actually 46
 

00:10:02.590 --> 00:10:03.600
two previous methods one is actually 46
I'll transfer and one is for

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:03.610
I'll transfer and one is for
 

00:10:03.610 --> 00:10:05.460
I'll transfer and one is for
photographic style transfer and they

00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:05.470
photographic style transfer and they
 

00:10:05.470 --> 00:10:07.350
photographic style transfer and they
work yeah okay but you can see for

00:10:07.350 --> 00:10:07.360
work yeah okay but you can see for
 

00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:09.090
work yeah okay but you can see for
instance this one that was geared

00:10:09.090 --> 00:10:09.100
instance this one that was geared
 

00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:11.340
instance this one that was geared
towards East I'll transfer it often

00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:11.350
towards East I'll transfer it often
 

00:10:11.350 --> 00:10:13.290
towards East I'll transfer it often
create some artifacts right so the

00:10:13.290 --> 00:10:13.300
create some artifacts right so the
 

00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:15.480
create some artifacts right so the
geometry of the pyramid it's not quite

00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:15.490
geometry of the pyramid it's not quite
 

00:10:15.490 --> 00:10:16.230
geometry of the pyramid it's not quite
the same anymore

00:10:16.230 --> 00:10:16.240
the same anymore
 

00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:21.210
the same anymore
whereas for ours it remains the same we

00:10:21.210 --> 00:10:21.220
whereas for ours it remains the same we
 

00:10:21.220 --> 00:10:24.480
whereas for ours it remains the same we
show few more examples so again you know

00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:24.490
show few more examples so again you know
 

00:10:24.490 --> 00:10:26.460
show few more examples so again you know
style applied to the content photo and

00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:26.470
style applied to the content photo and
 

00:10:26.470 --> 00:10:28.110
style applied to the content photo and
this is compared to some older method

00:10:28.110 --> 00:10:28.120
this is compared to some older method
 

00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:30.450
this is compared to some older method
and just one it's from last year I think

00:10:30.450 --> 00:10:30.460
and just one it's from last year I think
 

00:10:30.460 --> 00:10:32.790
and just one it's from last year I think
or prove it here and this is our result

00:10:32.790 --> 00:10:32.800
or prove it here and this is our result
 

00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:36.270
or prove it here and this is our result
and overall yeah ours works fairly

00:10:36.270 --> 00:10:36.280
and overall yeah ours works fairly
 

00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:38.730
and overall yeah ours works fairly
consistently the style is usually

00:10:38.730 --> 00:10:38.740
consistently the style is usually
 

00:10:38.740 --> 00:10:39.930
consistently the style is usually
applied fairly well and there's hardly

00:10:39.930 --> 00:10:39.940
applied fairly well and there's hardly
 

00:10:39.940 --> 00:10:42.030

it's very good we did a user study to

00:10:52.050 --> 00:10:52.060
it's very good we did a user study to
 

00:10:52.060 --> 00:10:55.800
it's very good we did a user study to
see what people thought about different

methods that I just showed and we asked

00:10:58.710 --> 00:10:58.720
methods that I just showed and we asked
 

00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:02.240
methods that I just showed and we asked
two question to compare how well

00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:02.250
two question to compare how well
 

00:11:02.250 --> 00:11:04.500
two question to compare how well
photograph a stylized so how well do we

00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:04.510
photograph a stylized so how well do we
 

00:11:04.510 --> 00:11:07.380
photograph a stylized so how well do we
replicate the stylized photo and how

00:11:07.380 --> 00:11:07.390
replicate the stylized photo and how
 

00:11:07.390 --> 00:11:09.860
replicate the stylized photo and how
well and how photo realistic is theirs

00:11:09.860 --> 00:11:09.870
well and how photo realistic is theirs
 

00:11:09.870 --> 00:11:12.200
well and how photo realistic is theirs

it's based on an example and you apply
 

00:11:31.110 --> 00:11:34.460
it's based on an example and you apply
it to an image so it's similar to older

some point in your course that I'll go

00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:02.370
some point in your course that I'll go
 

00:12:02.370 --> 00:12:06.829
some point in your course that I'll go
over it very very briefly so again it's

00:12:06.829 --> 00:12:06.839
over it very very briefly so again it's
 

00:12:06.839 --> 00:12:08.840
over it very very briefly so again it's
the following so there's two components

00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:08.850
the following so there's two components
 

00:12:08.850 --> 00:12:11.210
the following so there's two components
to again so you have a generator which

00:12:11.210 --> 00:12:11.220
to again so you have a generator which
 

00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:14.360
to again so you have a generator which
takes some vector Z it's a latent vector

00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:14.370
takes some vector Z it's a latent vector
 

00:12:14.370 --> 00:12:17.630
takes some vector Z it's a latent vector
Z and based on this vector it generates

00:12:17.630 --> 00:12:17.640
Z and based on this vector it generates
 

00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:20.360
Z and based on this vector it generates
an output image and at the beginning

00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:20.370
an output image and at the beginning
 

00:12:20.370 --> 00:12:22.220
an output image and at the beginning
it's just a neural network randomized

00:12:22.220 --> 00:12:22.230
it's just a neural network randomized
 

00:12:22.230 --> 00:12:24.230
it's just a neural network randomized
with random sorry initialized with

00:12:24.230 --> 00:12:24.240
with random sorry initialized with
 

00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:26.000
with random sorry initialized with
random weights and it'll output some

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:26.010
random weights and it'll output some
 

00:12:26.010 --> 00:12:27.410
random weights and it'll output some
random image all right

00:12:27.410 --> 00:12:27.420
random image all right
 

00:12:27.420 --> 00:12:29.870
random image all right
then there's a discriminator which will

00:12:29.870 --> 00:12:29.880
then there's a discriminator which will
 

00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:31.579
then there's a discriminator which will
check whether your output is realistic

00:12:31.579 --> 00:12:31.589
check whether your output is realistic
 

00:12:31.589 --> 00:12:33.140
check whether your output is realistic
or not and the question is what does

00:12:33.140 --> 00:12:33.150
or not and the question is what does
 

00:12:33.150 --> 00:12:34.730
or not and the question is what does
realistic mean well actually what it

00:12:34.730 --> 00:12:34.740
realistic mean well actually what it
 

00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:36.470
realistic mean well actually what it
means is the discriminator is supposed

00:12:36.470 --> 00:12:36.480
means is the discriminator is supposed
 

00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:39.340
means is the discriminator is supposed
to check whether the synthesized image

00:12:39.340 --> 00:12:39.350
to check whether the synthesized image
 

00:12:39.350 --> 00:12:42.800
to check whether the synthesized image
is similar or the distribution of the

00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:42.810
is similar or the distribution of the
 

00:12:42.810 --> 00:12:44.810
is similar or the distribution of the
synthesized images is similar to the

00:12:44.810 --> 00:12:44.820
synthesized images is similar to the
 

00:12:44.820 --> 00:12:47.780
synthesized images is similar to the
distribution of your training data set

00:12:47.780 --> 00:12:47.790
distribution of your training data set
 

00:12:47.790 --> 00:12:49.630
distribution of your training data set
so you might have a training data set of

00:12:49.630 --> 00:12:49.640
so you might have a training data set of
 

00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:53.930
so you might have a training data set of
say faces as in this example here then

00:12:53.930 --> 00:12:53.940
say faces as in this example here then
 

00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:56.240
say faces as in this example here then
your goal the goal for the generator is

00:12:56.240 --> 00:12:56.250
your goal the goal for the generator is
 

00:12:56.250 --> 00:12:58.730
your goal the goal for the generator is
to generate images of faces that are

00:12:58.730 --> 00:12:58.740
to generate images of faces that are
 

00:12:58.740 --> 00:13:00.290
to generate images of faces that are
similar to the one in a training set and

00:13:00.290 --> 00:13:00.300
similar to the one in a training set and
 

00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:02.510
similar to the one in a training set and
has and with a similar distribution so

00:13:02.510 --> 00:13:02.520
has and with a similar distribution so
 

00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:04.370
has and with a similar distribution so
that's its goal the discriminators goal

00:13:04.370 --> 00:13:04.380
that's its goal the discriminators goal
 

00:13:04.380 --> 00:13:06.170
that's its goal the discriminators goal
is to figure out whether the generator

00:13:06.170 --> 00:13:06.180
is to figure out whether the generator
 

00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:09.110
is to figure out whether the generator
synthesizes images that are similar to

00:13:09.110 --> 00:13:09.120
synthesizes images that are similar to
 

00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:11.150
synthesizes images that are similar to
those in the training set or if they're

00:13:11.150 --> 00:13:11.160
those in the training set or if they're
 

00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:13.280
those in the training set or if they're
different so for instance if you were

00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:13.290
different so for instance if you were
 

00:13:13.290 --> 00:13:14.960
different so for instance if you were
generator accident they were to

00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:14.970
generator accident they were to
 

00:13:14.970 --> 00:13:16.820
generator accident they were to
synthesize a car it would say no this is

00:13:16.820 --> 00:13:16.830
synthesize a car it would say no this is
 

00:13:16.830 --> 00:13:18.740
synthesize a car it would say no this is
yeah it's not a face well it's not a

00:13:18.740 --> 00:13:18.750
yeah it's not a face well it's not a
 

00:13:18.750 --> 00:13:20.569
yeah it's not a face well it's not a
realistic face or if you were to

00:13:20.569 --> 00:13:20.579
realistic face or if you were to
 

00:13:20.579 --> 00:13:23.900
realistic face or if you were to
generate by accident a cartoon

00:13:23.900 --> 00:13:23.910
generate by accident a cartoon
 

00:13:23.910 --> 00:13:25.610
generate by accident a cartoon
it should also say no it's not a

00:13:25.610 --> 00:13:25.620
it should also say no it's not a
 

00:13:25.620 --> 00:13:27.470
it should also say no it's not a
realistic face because it doesn't look

00:13:27.470 --> 00:13:27.480
realistic face because it doesn't look
 

00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:29.470
realistic face because it doesn't look
like my training set of realistic faces

00:13:29.470 --> 00:13:29.480
like my training set of realistic faces
 

00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:32.360
like my training set of realistic faces
and he trained these two in a ping-pong

00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:32.370
and he trained these two in a ping-pong
 

00:13:32.370 --> 00:13:33.980
and he trained these two in a ping-pong
fashion so both are neural networks but

00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:33.990
fashion so both are neural networks but
 

00:13:33.990 --> 00:13:35.720
fashion so both are neural networks but
both are generator and the discriminated

00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:35.730
both are generator and the discriminated
 

00:13:35.730 --> 00:13:37.430
both are generator and the discriminated
and neural networks and they're both

00:13:37.430 --> 00:13:37.440
and neural networks and they're both
 

00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:39.980
and neural networks and they're both
trained together really well one of the

00:13:39.980 --> 00:13:39.990
trained together really well one of the
 

00:13:39.990 --> 00:13:42.639
trained together really well one of the
other usually near ping pong fashion and

00:13:42.639 --> 00:13:42.649
other usually near ping pong fashion and
 

00:13:42.649 --> 00:13:44.420
other usually near ping pong fashion and
surprisingly you can actually make this

00:13:44.420 --> 00:13:44.430
surprisingly you can actually make this
 

00:13:44.430 --> 00:13:46.550
surprisingly you can actually make this
work right even though yeah needle

00:13:46.550 --> 00:13:46.560
work right even though yeah needle
 

00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:48.259
work right even though yeah needle
generator or the discriminator actually

knows anything at the beginning they

00:13:49.550 --> 00:13:49.560
knows anything at the beginning they
 

00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:52.699
knows anything at the beginning they
still manage to converge to a reasonable

still manage to converge to a reasonable
 

00:13:52.709 --> 00:13:59.500
still manage to converge to a reasonable
solution and synthesize realistic images

00:13:59.500 --> 00:13:59.510
 
 

00:13:59.510 --> 00:14:02.090
 
most of the Gantt work works in a

00:14:02.090 --> 00:14:02.100
most of the Gantt work works in a
 

00:14:02.100 --> 00:14:03.319
most of the Gantt work works in a
supervised fashion meaning you have

00:14:03.319 --> 00:14:03.329
supervised fashion meaning you have
 

00:14:03.329 --> 00:14:05.180
supervised fashion meaning you have
training samples at Roy training Paris

00:14:05.180 --> 00:14:05.190
training samples at Roy training Paris
 

00:14:05.190 --> 00:14:08.300

right you have an input image say a shoe

00:14:08.300 --> 00:14:08.310
right you have an input image say a shoe
 

00:14:08.310 --> 00:14:09.530
right you have an input image say a shoe
given oh sorry

00:14:09.530 --> 00:14:09.540
given oh sorry
 

00:14:09.540 --> 00:14:11.720

notice you give it an image given edges

00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:11.730
notice you give it an image given edges
 

00:14:11.730 --> 00:14:14.389
notice you give it an image given edges
and the output might be a

00:14:14.389 --> 00:14:14.399
and the output might be a
 

00:14:14.399 --> 00:14:15.259
and the output might be a
realistic-looking

00:14:15.259 --> 00:14:15.269
realistic-looking
 

00:14:15.269 --> 00:14:16.819
realistic-looking
shoes right it might be a training pair

00:14:16.819 --> 00:14:16.829
shoes right it might be a training pair
 

00:14:16.829 --> 00:14:18.350
shoes right it might be a training pair
so you know that you should go from this

00:14:18.350 --> 00:14:18.360
so you know that you should go from this
 

00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:20.930
so you know that you should go from this
edge image to this particular shoe we'll

00:14:20.930 --> 00:14:20.940
edge image to this particular shoe we'll
 

00:14:20.940 --> 00:14:22.699
edge image to this particular shoe we'll
also talk a bit about the unsupervised

00:14:22.699 --> 00:14:22.709
also talk a bit about the unsupervised
 

00:14:22.709 --> 00:14:24.920
also talk a bit about the unsupervised
setting where I have two training sets

00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:24.930
setting where I have two training sets
 

00:14:24.930 --> 00:14:26.870
setting where I have two training sets
but they're not in correspondence it

00:14:26.870 --> 00:14:26.880
but they're not in correspondence it
 

00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:29.569
but they're not in correspondence it
might be one training set of data images

00:14:29.569 --> 00:14:29.579
might be one training set of data images
 

00:14:29.579 --> 00:14:31.790
might be one training set of data images
they might one and the other training

00:14:31.790 --> 00:14:31.800
they might one and the other training
 

00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:33.710
they might one and the other training
set might be nighttime images they might

00:14:33.710 --> 00:14:33.720
set might be nighttime images they might
 

00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:36.110
set might be nighttime images they might
all be driving videos all right so they

00:14:36.110 --> 00:14:36.120
all be driving videos all right so they
 

00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:37.910
all be driving videos all right so they
might they're related to training sets

00:14:37.910 --> 00:14:37.920
might they're related to training sets
 

00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:39.439
might they're related to training sets
but they're not identical in a sense

00:14:39.439 --> 00:14:39.449
but they're not identical in a sense
 

00:14:39.449 --> 00:14:42.350
but they're not identical in a sense
that for x1 I have a corresponding image

00:14:42.350 --> 00:14:42.360
that for x1 I have a corresponding image
 

00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:44.840
that for x1 I have a corresponding image
x2 that was taken at night type from the

same point of view with the same cars in
 

00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:47.480
same point of view with the same cars in
the same place right because it's

00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:47.490
the same place right because it's
 

00:14:47.490 --> 00:14:48.980
the same place right because it's
difficult do actually it's impossible to

do to create data sets that are in full

00:14:50.750 --> 00:14:50.760
do to create data sets that are in full
 

00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:52.189

something that moves then you're

00:14:56.870 --> 00:14:56.880
something that moves then you're
 

00:14:56.880 --> 00:14:58.430

unsupervised fashion I have just two

00:14:58.430 --> 00:14:58.440
unsupervised fashion I have just two
 

00:14:58.440 --> 00:15:00.050
unsupervised fashion I have just two
separate training sets they're similar

00:15:00.050 --> 00:15:00.060
separate training sets they're similar
 

00:15:00.060 --> 00:15:05.389
separate training sets they're similar
but not in direct correspondence in

00:15:05.389 --> 00:15:05.399
but not in direct correspondence in
 

00:15:05.399 --> 00:15:07.430
but not in direct correspondence in
addition we also care about unimodal

00:15:07.430 --> 00:15:07.440
addition we also care about unimodal
 

00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:10.340
addition we also care about unimodal
verses multimodal so what I just showed

00:15:10.340 --> 00:15:10.350
verses multimodal so what I just showed
 

00:15:10.350 --> 00:15:12.470
verses multimodal so what I just showed
where the original candidates explained

00:15:12.470 --> 00:15:12.480
where the original candidates explained
 

00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:14.660
where the original candidates explained
there was a unimodal model meaning if

00:15:14.660 --> 00:15:14.670
there was a unimodal model meaning if
 

00:15:14.670 --> 00:15:16.100
there was a unimodal model meaning if
you want to do translations say from

00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:16.110
you want to do translations say from
 

00:15:16.110 --> 00:15:19.160
you want to do translations say from
dogs two cats it might only output one

00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:19.170
dogs two cats it might only output one
 

00:15:19.170 --> 00:15:21.530
dogs two cats it might only output one
cat right where's the multimodal model

00:15:21.530 --> 00:15:21.540
cat right where's the multimodal model
 

00:15:21.540 --> 00:15:23.480
cat right where's the multimodal model
you might be able to give it serve

00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:23.490
you might be able to give it serve
 

00:15:23.490 --> 00:15:28.460
you might be able to give it serve
another style vector and you might be

00:15:28.460 --> 00:15:28.470
another style vector and you might be
 

00:15:28.470 --> 00:15:31.009
another style vector and you might be
able to go not just from one dog to one

00:15:31.009 --> 00:15:31.019
able to go not just from one dog to one
 

00:15:31.019 --> 00:15:32.960
able to go not just from one dog to one
cat but to potentially different cats

00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:32.970
cat but to potentially different cats
 

00:15:32.970 --> 00:15:35.740
cat but to potentially different cats
that have yea different looks

00:15:35.740 --> 00:15:35.750
that have yea different looks
 

00:15:35.750 --> 00:15:38.090
that have yea different looks
so these are all the different ways of

00:15:38.090 --> 00:15:38.100
so these are all the different ways of
 

00:15:38.100 --> 00:15:40.280
so these are all the different ways of
classifying the work that I'm going to

00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:40.290
classifying the work that I'm going to
 

00:15:40.290 --> 00:15:41.690
classifying the work that I'm going to
present today and there's lots of work

00:15:41.690 --> 00:15:41.700
present today and there's lots of work
 

00:15:41.700 --> 00:15:43.070
present today and there's lots of work
in this space and this is just a list of

00:15:43.070 --> 00:15:43.080
in this space and this is just a list of
 

00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:44.960
in this space and this is just a list of
some of the gann papers that came out

00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:44.970
some of the gann papers that came out
 

00:15:44.970 --> 00:15:47.570
some of the gann papers that came out
with the last year or two and I'll talk

00:15:47.570 --> 00:15:47.580
with the last year or two and I'll talk
 

00:15:47.580 --> 00:15:49.670
with the last year or two and I'll talk
about some homework and I'll put that in

00:15:49.670 --> 00:15:49.680
about some homework and I'll put that in
 

00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:51.230
about some homework and I'll put that in
context so first one I'd like to talk

00:15:51.230 --> 00:15:51.240
context so first one I'd like to talk
 

00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:54.950
context so first one I'd like to talk
about fixed to pics HD which we

00:15:54.950 --> 00:15:54.960
about fixed to pics HD which we
 

00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:57.020
about fixed to pics HD which we
presented this year sorry last year at

00:15:57.020 --> 00:15:57.030
presented this year sorry last year at
 

00:15:57.030 --> 00:16:01.100
presented this year sorry last year at
cvpr and it's supervised and it's

00:16:01.100 --> 00:16:01.110
cvpr and it's supervised and it's
 

00:16:01.110 --> 00:16:03.770
cvpr and it's supervised and it's
multimodal and and really the goal was

00:16:03.770 --> 00:16:03.780
multimodal and and really the goal was
 

00:16:03.780 --> 00:16:07.160
multimodal and and really the goal was
here to do a conditional again that goes

00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:07.170
here to do a conditional again that goes
 

00:16:07.170 --> 00:16:09.230
here to do a conditional again that goes
from a label map which he shot which I

00:16:09.230 --> 00:16:09.240
from a label map which he shot which I
 

00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:11.300
from a label map which he shot which I
showed at the very beginning to an image

00:16:11.300 --> 00:16:11.310
showed at the very beginning to an image
 

00:16:11.310 --> 00:16:14.120
showed at the very beginning to an image
so given labels of the scene so the

00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:14.130
so given labels of the scene so the
 

00:16:14.130 --> 00:16:15.650
so given labels of the scene so the
labels say yeah this is road this is

00:16:15.650 --> 00:16:15.660
labels say yeah this is road this is
 

00:16:15.660 --> 00:16:17.660
labels say yeah this is road this is
sidewalk this is car this is you know

00:16:17.660 --> 00:16:17.670
sidewalk this is car this is you know
 

00:16:17.670 --> 00:16:20.540
sidewalk this is car this is you know
people and so forth given these labels I

00:16:20.540 --> 00:16:20.550
people and so forth given these labels I
 

00:16:20.550 --> 00:16:21.860
people and so forth given these labels I
want to synthesize an image that looks

00:16:21.860 --> 00:16:21.870
want to synthesize an image that looks
 

00:16:21.870 --> 00:16:24.020
want to synthesize an image that looks
realistic but corresponds to the label

00:16:24.020 --> 00:16:24.030
realistic but corresponds to the label
 

00:16:24.030 --> 00:16:26.420
realistic but corresponds to the label
that I'm given all right so now I need

00:16:26.420 --> 00:16:26.430
that I'm given all right so now I need
 

00:16:26.430 --> 00:16:29.360
that I'm given all right so now I need
to learn this somehow how do I learn

00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:29.370
to learn this somehow how do I learn
 

00:16:29.370 --> 00:16:35.510
to learn this somehow how do I learn
this we will make use of Gans with a

00:16:35.510 --> 00:16:35.520
this we will make use of Gans with a
 

00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:37.340
this we will make use of Gans with a
slight difference to the way I explained

00:16:37.340 --> 00:16:37.350
slight difference to the way I explained
 

00:16:37.350 --> 00:16:38.900
slight difference to the way I explained
to him at the beginning so now the input

00:16:38.900 --> 00:16:38.910
to him at the beginning so now the input
 

00:16:38.910 --> 00:16:41.120
to him at the beginning so now the input
is not just a latent vector z but rather

00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:41.130
is not just a latent vector z but rather
 

00:16:41.130 --> 00:16:44.990
is not just a latent vector z but rather
it's the label map if it's an image so

00:16:44.990 --> 00:16:45.000
it's the label map if it's an image so
 

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:46.910
it's the label map if it's an image so
we want to condition the generator on

00:16:46.910 --> 00:16:46.920
we want to condition the generator on
 

00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:50.300
we want to condition the generator on
the label image this the discriminator

00:16:50.300 --> 00:16:50.310
the label image this the discriminator
 

00:16:50.310 --> 00:16:51.740
the label image this the discriminator
still does the same thing it still will

00:16:51.740 --> 00:16:51.750
still does the same thing it still will
 

00:16:51.750 --> 00:16:54.200
still does the same thing it still will
tell you or it's it's task is to tell

00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:54.210
tell you or it's it's task is to tell
 

00:16:54.210 --> 00:16:56.780
tell you or it's it's task is to tell
you whether the synthesized image looks

00:16:56.780 --> 00:16:56.790
you whether the synthesized image looks
 

00:16:56.790 --> 00:17:00.320
you whether the synthesized image looks
like a real ya image except it also

00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:00.330
like a real ya image except it also
 

00:17:00.330 --> 00:17:02.360
like a real ya image except it also
knows what the labels look like so it

00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:02.370
knows what the labels look like so it
 

00:17:02.370 --> 00:17:04.880
knows what the labels look like so it
can sort of check whether or you can try

00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:04.890
can sort of check whether or you can try
 

00:17:04.890 --> 00:17:06.440
can sort of check whether or you can try
and figure out whether to synthesize the

00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:06.450
and figure out whether to synthesize the
 

00:17:06.450 --> 00:17:08.150
and figure out whether to synthesize the
image actually corresponds to the labels

00:17:08.150 --> 00:17:08.160
image actually corresponds to the labels
 

00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:10.280
image actually corresponds to the labels
and whether it's you know similar to

00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:10.290
and whether it's you know similar to
 

00:17:10.290 --> 00:17:15.170
and whether it's you know similar to
other images in the training set right

00:17:15.170 --> 00:17:15.180
other images in the training set right
 

00:17:15.180 --> 00:17:17.500
other images in the training set right
so in that sense it's similar in

00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:17.510
so in that sense it's similar in
 

00:17:17.510 --> 00:17:21.910
so in that sense it's similar in
addition what we do we add sources

00:17:21.910 --> 00:17:21.920
addition what we do we add sources
 

00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:23.329
addition what we do we add sources
multi-modality

00:17:23.329 --> 00:17:23.339
multi-modality
 

00:17:23.339 --> 00:17:27.140
multi-modality
to it so we add to this additional step

00:17:27.140 --> 00:17:27.150
to it so we add to this additional step
 

00:17:27.150 --> 00:17:30.410
to it so we add to this additional step
so once we finish training um we look at

00:17:30.410 --> 00:17:30.420
so once we finish training um we look at
 

00:17:30.420 --> 00:17:33.560
so once we finish training um we look at
all the features underneath a particular

00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:33.570
all the features underneath a particular
 

00:17:33.570 --> 00:17:35.660
all the features underneath a particular
label so if we look at all the streets

00:17:35.660 --> 00:17:35.670
label so if we look at all the streets
 

00:17:35.670 --> 00:17:38.060
label so if we look at all the streets
we look at all the cars and so forth and

00:17:38.060 --> 00:17:38.070
we look at all the cars and so forth and
 

00:17:38.070 --> 00:17:40.790
we look at all the cars and so forth and
then we try and cluster the features

00:17:40.790 --> 00:17:40.800
then we try and cluster the features
 

00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:42.800
then we try and cluster the features
that we see during training so for

00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:42.810
that we see during training so for
 

00:17:42.810 --> 00:17:44.360
that we see during training so for
instance for the road you might have

00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:44.370
instance for the road you might have
 

00:17:44.370 --> 00:17:46.760
instance for the road you might have
seen a lot of standard tar right

00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:46.770
seen a lot of standard tar right
 

00:17:46.770 --> 00:17:48.190
seen a lot of standard tar right
substandard yeah

00:17:48.190 --> 00:17:48.200
substandard yeah
 

00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:49.869
substandard yeah
Rhodes but you might also have seen

00:17:49.869 --> 00:17:49.879
Rhodes but you might also have seen
 

00:17:49.879 --> 00:17:52.269
Rhodes but you might also have seen
cobblestone and to hope is by clustering

00:17:52.269 --> 00:17:52.279
cobblestone and to hope is by clustering
 

00:17:52.279 --> 00:17:53.710
cobblestone and to hope is by clustering
you can figure out today sort of two

00:17:53.710 --> 00:17:53.720
you can figure out today sort of two
 

00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:55.570
you can figure out today sort of two
dominant things which is normal Road

00:17:55.570 --> 00:17:55.580
dominant things which is normal Road
 

00:17:55.580 --> 00:17:58.529
dominant things which is normal Road
which is paved and cobblestone road

00:17:58.529 --> 00:17:58.539
which is paved and cobblestone road
 

00:17:58.539 --> 00:18:00.399
which is paved and cobblestone road
because once we do this we can actually

00:18:00.399 --> 00:18:00.409
because once we do this we can actually
 

00:18:00.409 --> 00:18:02.409
because once we do this we can actually
use this for the synthesis we can give

00:18:02.409 --> 00:18:02.419
use this for the synthesis we can give
 

00:18:02.419 --> 00:18:04.779
use this for the synthesis we can give
it to the decoder and say it should be

00:18:04.779 --> 00:18:04.789
it to the decoder and say it should be
 

00:18:04.789 --> 00:18:06.279
it to the decoder and say it should be
one or the other so you can actually do

00:18:06.279 --> 00:18:06.289
one or the other so you can actually do
 

00:18:06.289 --> 00:18:11.139
one or the other so you can actually do
a multi-modal synthesis then there's

00:18:11.139 --> 00:18:11.149
a multi-modal synthesis then there's
 

00:18:11.149 --> 00:18:13.330
a multi-modal synthesis then there's
some other tricks that we play to make

00:18:13.330 --> 00:18:13.340
some other tricks that we play to make
 

00:18:13.340 --> 00:18:15.220
some other tricks that we play to make
sure it actually works well and those

00:18:15.220 --> 00:18:15.230
sure it actually works well and those
 

00:18:15.230 --> 00:18:17.139
sure it actually works well and those
are really important so if you just use

00:18:17.139 --> 00:18:17.149
are really important so if you just use
 

00:18:17.149 --> 00:18:19.690
are really important so if you just use
the standard again the quality of

00:18:19.690 --> 00:18:19.700
the standard again the quality of
 

00:18:19.700 --> 00:18:22.869
the standard again the quality of
results is usually okay but not great so

00:18:22.869 --> 00:18:22.879
results is usually okay but not great so
 

00:18:22.879 --> 00:18:24.669
results is usually okay but not great so
we do two things we do we change the

00:18:24.669 --> 00:18:24.679
we do two things we do we change the
 

00:18:24.679 --> 00:18:26.710
we do two things we do we change the
generator and train it in a coarse to

00:18:26.710 --> 00:18:26.720
generator and train it in a coarse to
 

00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:28.419
generator and train it in a coarse to
fine fashion so we first train it to

00:18:28.419 --> 00:18:28.429
fine fashion so we first train it to
 

00:18:28.429 --> 00:18:31.210
fine fashion so we first train it to
synthesize low res images and then once

00:18:31.210 --> 00:18:31.220
synthesize low res images and then once
 

00:18:31.220 --> 00:18:32.499
synthesize low res images and then once
we're good at these low resolution

00:18:32.499 --> 00:18:32.509
we're good at these low resolution
 

00:18:32.509 --> 00:18:34.899
we're good at these low resolution
images we take it and add sort of layers

00:18:34.899 --> 00:18:34.909
images we take it and add sort of layers
 

00:18:34.909 --> 00:18:36.669
images we take it and add sort of layers
around it serve it at the beginning at

00:18:36.669 --> 00:18:36.679
around it serve it at the beginning at
 

00:18:36.679 --> 00:18:40.060
around it serve it at the beginning at
the end to make it synthesize higher

00:18:40.060 --> 00:18:40.070
the end to make it synthesize higher
 

00:18:40.070 --> 00:18:42.249
the end to make it synthesize higher
resolution images and that really helps

00:18:42.249 --> 00:18:42.259
resolution images and that really helps
 

00:18:42.259 --> 00:18:44.979
resolution images and that really helps
a lot furthermore we have these multi

00:18:44.979 --> 00:18:44.989
a lot furthermore we have these multi
 

00:18:44.989 --> 00:18:46.269
a lot furthermore we have these multi
scale discriminator so we discriminate

00:18:46.269 --> 00:18:46.279
scale discriminator so we discriminate
 

00:18:46.279 --> 00:18:49.090
scale discriminator so we discriminate
so discriminate or not just looks at the

00:18:49.090 --> 00:18:49.100
so discriminate or not just looks at the
 

00:18:49.100 --> 00:18:50.950
so discriminate or not just looks at the
high resolution images but images of

00:18:50.950 --> 00:18:50.960
high resolution images but images of
 

00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:53.139
high resolution images but images of
different resolutions which helps it to

00:18:53.139 --> 00:18:53.149
different resolutions which helps it to
 

00:18:53.149 --> 00:18:54.879
different resolutions which helps it to
server have a better global view of

00:18:54.879 --> 00:18:54.889
server have a better global view of
 

00:18:54.889 --> 00:18:56.139
server have a better global view of
what's going on so it's better

00:18:56.139 --> 00:18:56.149
what's going on so it's better
 

00:18:56.149 --> 00:18:59.499
what's going on so it's better
discriminating badly synthesized images

00:18:59.499 --> 00:18:59.509
discriminating badly synthesized images
 

00:18:59.509 --> 00:19:00.999
discriminating badly synthesized images
from from what they actually should look

00:19:00.999 --> 00:19:01.009
from from what they actually should look
 

00:19:01.009 --> 00:19:04.409
from from what they actually should look
like and we also use this robust

00:19:04.409 --> 00:19:04.419
like and we also use this robust
 

00:19:04.419 --> 00:19:07.659
like and we also use this robust
objective so instead of just doing the

00:19:07.659 --> 00:19:07.669
objective so instead of just doing the
 

00:19:07.669 --> 00:19:12.489
objective so instead of just doing the
Gantt loss we we also add what people

00:19:12.489 --> 00:19:12.499
Gantt loss we we also add what people
 

00:19:12.499 --> 00:19:14.169
Gantt loss we we also add what people
call a feature loss so feature losses

00:19:14.169 --> 00:19:14.179
call a feature loss so feature losses
 

00:19:14.179 --> 00:19:16.180
call a feature loss so feature losses
are often used when you're when your

00:19:16.180 --> 00:19:16.190
are often used when you're when your
 

00:19:16.190 --> 00:19:18.669
are often used when you're when your
task is to synthesize or create images

00:19:18.669 --> 00:19:18.679
task is to synthesize or create images
 

00:19:18.679 --> 00:19:22.119
task is to synthesize or create images
of some kind which means that you don't

00:19:22.119 --> 00:19:22.129
of some kind which means that you don't
 

00:19:22.129 --> 00:19:23.950
of some kind which means that you don't
just look whether your synthesized image

00:19:23.950 --> 00:19:23.960
just look whether your synthesized image
 

00:19:23.960 --> 00:19:26.769
just look whether your synthesized image
looks like a particular other image so

00:19:26.769 --> 00:19:26.779
looks like a particular other image so
 

00:19:26.779 --> 00:19:28.389
looks like a particular other image so
you don't just use an L to different say

00:19:28.389 --> 00:19:28.399
you don't just use an L to different say
 

00:19:28.399 --> 00:19:31.269
you don't just use an L to different say
an l1 norm between images but rather e

00:19:31.269 --> 00:19:31.279
an l1 norm between images but rather e
 

00:19:31.279 --> 00:19:35.619
an l1 norm between images but rather e

00:19:35.619 --> 00:19:35.629
to it in the space of a neural network
 

00:19:35.629 --> 00:19:37.509
to it in the space of a neural network
so in this case if we take the features

00:19:37.509 --> 00:19:37.519
so in this case if we take the features
 

00:19:37.519 --> 00:19:39.099
so in this case if we take the features
of the discriminator and check what it

00:19:39.099 --> 00:19:39.109
of the discriminator and check what it
 

00:19:39.109 --> 00:19:41.379
of the discriminator and check what it
is similar between our you know training

00:19:41.379 --> 00:19:41.389
is similar between our you know training
 

00:19:41.389 --> 00:19:43.060
is similar between our you know training
images and there are synthesized images

00:19:43.060 --> 00:19:43.070
images and there are synthesized images
 

00:19:43.070 --> 00:19:44.499
images and there are synthesized images
which also helps a lot sometimes it's

00:19:44.499 --> 00:19:44.509
which also helps a lot sometimes it's
 

00:19:44.509 --> 00:19:46.599
which also helps a lot sometimes it's
also called a vgg loss and it's quite

00:19:46.599 --> 00:19:46.609
also called a vgg loss and it's quite
 

00:19:46.609 --> 00:19:47.549
also called a vgg loss and it's quite
useful

00:19:47.549 --> 00:19:47.559
useful
 

00:19:47.559 --> 00:19:50.560
useful
what so when you do all those things you

00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:50.570
what so when you do all those things you
 

00:19:50.570 --> 00:19:53.289
what so when you do all those things you
can do something like this so here ya

00:19:53.289 --> 00:19:53.299
can do something like this so here ya
 

00:19:53.299 --> 00:19:56.019
can do something like this so here ya
label map is shown on the top and then

00:19:56.019 --> 00:19:56.029
label map is shown on the top and then
 

00:19:56.029 --> 00:19:58.269
label map is shown on the top and then
we go through different modalities so

00:19:58.269 --> 00:19:58.279
we go through different modalities so
 

00:19:58.279 --> 00:20:00.910
we go through different modalities so
it's always the same

00:20:00.910 --> 00:20:00.920
it's always the same
 

00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:03.850
it's always the same
a structure that we create except we say

00:20:03.850 --> 00:20:03.860
a structure that we create except we say
 

00:20:03.860 --> 00:20:05.590
a structure that we create except we say
go through different pavements and

00:20:05.590 --> 00:20:05.600
go through different pavements and
 

00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:07.240
go through different pavements and
different cobblestone and change the

00:20:07.240 --> 00:20:07.250
different cobblestone and change the
 

00:20:07.250 --> 00:20:15.210
different cobblestone and change the
cars go through different potential cars

00:20:15.210 --> 00:20:15.220
 
 

00:20:15.220 --> 00:20:17.320
 
you know always it does something

00:20:17.320 --> 00:20:17.330
you know always it does something
 

00:20:17.330 --> 00:20:19.030
you know always it does something
sensible if you look carefully you can

00:20:19.030 --> 00:20:19.040
sensible if you look carefully you can
 

00:20:19.040 --> 00:20:21.190
sensible if you look carefully you can
see it it's not always great like the

00:20:21.190 --> 00:20:21.200
see it it's not always great like the
 

00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:22.840
see it it's not always great like the
white car you know it doesn't look

00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:22.850
white car you know it doesn't look
 

00:20:22.850 --> 00:20:25.630
white car you know it doesn't look
perfect actually if it comes up again it

00:20:25.630 --> 00:20:25.640
perfect actually if it comes up again it
 

00:20:25.640 --> 00:20:27.970
perfect actually if it comes up again it
looks ya slightly funky but overall it's

00:20:27.970 --> 00:20:27.980
looks ya slightly funky but overall it's
 

00:20:27.980 --> 00:20:29.260
looks ya slightly funky but overall it's
actually surprising that you can learn

00:20:29.260 --> 00:20:29.270
actually surprising that you can learn
 

00:20:29.270 --> 00:20:31.320
actually surprising that you can learn
you know from just the data set off

00:20:31.320 --> 00:20:31.330
you know from just the data set off
 

00:20:31.330 --> 00:20:33.760
you know from just the data set off
label maps and their corresponding

00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:33.770
label maps and their corresponding
 

00:20:33.770 --> 00:20:35.770
label maps and their corresponding
images you can actually learn to

00:20:35.770 --> 00:20:35.780
images you can actually learn to
 

00:20:35.780 --> 00:20:37.960
images you can actually learn to
synthesize realistic looking or mostly

00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:37.970
synthesize realistic looking or mostly
 

00:20:37.970 --> 00:20:42.580
synthesize realistic looking or mostly
realistic looking images if you're gonna

00:20:42.580 --> 00:20:42.590
realistic looking images if you're gonna
 

00:20:42.590 --> 00:20:44.410
realistic looking images if you're gonna
now change some of the labels in the

00:20:44.410 --> 00:20:44.420
now change some of the labels in the
 

00:20:44.420 --> 00:20:45.790
now change some of the labels in the
background so some of this guy we make

00:20:45.790 --> 00:20:45.800
background so some of this guy we make
 

00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:49.600
background so some of this guy we make
too so here the sky becomes trees you

00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:49.610
too so here the sky becomes trees you
 

00:20:49.610 --> 00:20:51.250
too so here the sky becomes trees you
know we change the trees to buildings

00:20:51.250 --> 00:20:51.260
know we change the trees to buildings
 

00:20:51.260 --> 00:20:53.320
know we change the trees to buildings
and so you can actually change this on

00:20:53.320 --> 00:20:53.330
and so you can actually change this on
 

00:20:53.330 --> 00:20:55.120
and so you can actually change this on
the fly not on the fly you can actually

00:20:55.120 --> 00:20:55.130
the fly not on the fly you can actually
 

00:20:55.130 --> 00:20:56.710
the fly not on the fly you can actually
change this and resynthesize and you get

00:20:56.710 --> 00:20:56.720
change this and resynthesize and you get
 

00:20:56.720 --> 00:20:59.140
change this and resynthesize and you get
a reasonable image out it's really quite

00:20:59.140 --> 00:20:59.150
a reasonable image out it's really quite
 

00:20:59.150 --> 00:21:01.210
a reasonable image out it's really quite
neat to do this you can also if you'd

00:21:01.210 --> 00:21:01.220
neat to do this you can also if you'd
 

00:21:01.220 --> 00:21:03.820
neat to do this you can also if you'd
like yes or paint parts that you want to

00:21:03.820 --> 00:21:03.830
like yes or paint parts that you want to
 

00:21:03.830 --> 00:21:05.740
like yes or paint parts that you want to
be houses or paint parts that you want

00:21:05.740 --> 00:21:05.750
be houses or paint parts that you want
 

00:21:05.750 --> 00:21:07.300
be houses or paint parts that you want
to be a tree so you can do modifications

00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:07.310
to be a tree so you can do modifications
 

00:21:07.310 --> 00:21:10.090
to be a tree so you can do modifications
of your label map and then at the neural

00:21:10.090 --> 00:21:10.100
of your label map and then at the neural
 

00:21:10.100 --> 00:21:12.370
of your label map and then at the neural
network just synthesize this and an

00:21:12.370 --> 00:21:12.380
network just synthesize this and an
 

00:21:12.380 --> 00:21:13.960
network just synthesize this and an
image according to your label map so

00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:13.970
image according to your label map so
 

00:21:13.970 --> 00:21:15.730
image according to your label map so
it's sort of painting by numbers and it

00:21:15.730 --> 00:21:15.740
it's sort of painting by numbers and it
 

00:21:15.740 --> 00:21:20.020
it's sort of painting by numbers and it
works yeah fairly well it's a comparison

00:21:20.020 --> 00:21:20.030
works yeah fairly well it's a comparison
 

00:21:20.030 --> 00:21:21.820
works yeah fairly well it's a comparison
to some of the previous work it's only

00:21:21.820 --> 00:21:21.830
to some of the previous work it's only
 

00:21:21.830 --> 00:21:24.550
to some of the previous work it's only
top left its previous method that was

00:21:24.550 --> 00:21:24.560
top left its previous method that was
 

00:21:24.560 --> 00:21:27.670
top left its previous method that was
called picks two picks and then CRN

00:21:27.670 --> 00:21:27.680
called picks two picks and then CRN
 

00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:29.500

without the feature loss and it's hard

00:21:37.690 --> 00:21:37.700
without the feature loss and it's hard
 

00:21:37.700 --> 00:21:39.610
without the feature loss and it's hard
to tell but the one on the right is

00:21:39.610 --> 00:21:39.620
to tell but the one on the right is
 

00:21:39.620 --> 00:21:41.670
to tell but the one on the right is
slightly better than the one on the left

00:21:41.670 --> 00:21:41.680
slightly better than the one on the left
 

00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:46.060
slightly better than the one on the left
so this was picks two picks then more

00:21:46.060 --> 00:21:46.070
so this was picks two picks then more
 

00:21:46.070 --> 00:21:48.910
so this was picks two picks then more
recently we extended this to videos so

00:21:48.910 --> 00:21:48.920
recently we extended this to videos so
 

00:21:48.920 --> 00:21:52.320
recently we extended this to videos so
it was published at nurbs late last year

00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:52.330
it was published at nurbs late last year
 

00:21:52.330 --> 00:21:54.730
it was published at nurbs late last year
so now the difference is that we don't

00:21:54.730 --> 00:21:54.740
so now the difference is that we don't
 

00:21:54.740 --> 00:21:56.950
so now the difference is that we don't
want to just take a single frame as

00:21:56.950 --> 00:21:56.960
want to just take a single frame as
 

00:21:56.960 --> 00:21:58.810
want to just take a single frame as
input and synthesize an image but rather

00:21:58.810 --> 00:21:58.820
input and synthesize an image but rather
 

00:21:58.820 --> 00:22:01.630
input and synthesize an image but rather
a video of label maps and synthesize a

00:22:01.630 --> 00:22:01.640
a video of label maps and synthesize a
 

00:22:01.640 --> 00:22:04.960
a video of label maps and synthesize a
video of realistic looking scenes

00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:04.970
video of realistic looking scenes
 

00:22:04.970 --> 00:22:08.350
video of realistic looking scenes
according to the video of label maps now

00:22:08.350 --> 00:22:08.360
according to the video of label maps now
 

00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:10.060
according to the video of label maps now
you could say well why don't just use

00:22:10.060 --> 00:22:10.070
you could say well why don't just use
 

00:22:10.070 --> 00:22:11.770
you could say well why don't just use
you know what you just presented right

00:22:11.770 --> 00:22:11.780
you know what you just presented right
 

00:22:11.780 --> 00:22:13.450
you know what you just presented right

our per frame basis
 

00:22:14.790 --> 00:22:17.000
our per frame basis
and you can do this except it looks like

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:17.010
and you can do this except it looks like
 

00:22:17.010 --> 00:22:20.230
and you can do this except it looks like
this each frame is alright

00:22:20.230 --> 00:22:20.240
this each frame is alright
 

00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:22.880
this each frame is alright
except temporally they're not coherent

00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:22.890
except temporally they're not coherent
 

00:22:22.890 --> 00:22:24.890
except temporally they're not coherent
because we didn't ask you to be

00:22:24.890 --> 00:22:24.900
because we didn't ask you to be
 

00:22:24.900 --> 00:22:26.150
because we didn't ask you to be
temporally coherent it doesn't know

00:22:26.150 --> 00:22:26.160
temporally coherent it doesn't know
 

00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:27.800
temporally coherent it doesn't know
anything about previous images for next

anything about previous images for next
 

00:22:27.810 --> 00:22:30.350
anything about previous images for next
image this that follow so each image is

00:22:30.350 --> 00:22:30.360
image this that follow so each image is
 

00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:32.720
image this that follow so each image is
okay but overall yeah it flickers a lot

00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:32.730
okay but overall yeah it flickers a lot
 

00:22:32.730 --> 00:22:36.230
okay but overall yeah it flickers a lot
right so it's not quite what you want so

00:22:36.230 --> 00:22:36.240
right so it's not quite what you want so
 

00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:37.700
right so it's not quite what you want so
we need to do something to make it too

00:22:37.700 --> 00:22:37.710
we need to do something to make it too
 

00:22:37.710 --> 00:22:41.930
we need to do something to make it too
poorly coherent and it's it's fairly

00:22:41.930 --> 00:22:41.940
poorly coherent and it's it's fairly
 

00:22:41.940 --> 00:22:47.240
poorly coherent and it's it's fairly
clear sorry Tara and it's a really an

00:22:47.240 --> 00:22:47.250

extension of pics to excite she says

00:22:48.710 --> 00:22:48.720
extension of pics to excite she says
 

00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:54.350
extension of pics to excite she says
it's very similar in architecture so the

00:22:54.350 --> 00:22:54.360
it's very similar in architecture so the
 

00:22:54.360 --> 00:22:55.940
it's very similar in architecture so the
first thing we do we built a sequential

00:22:55.940 --> 00:22:55.950
first thing we do we built a sequential
 

00:22:55.950 --> 00:22:58.850
first thing we do we built a sequential
generator so now we say you don't just

00:22:58.850 --> 00:22:58.860
generator so now we say you don't just
 

00:22:58.860 --> 00:23:02.210
generator so now we say you don't just
get a single map as input but what you

00:23:02.210 --> 00:23:02.220
get a single map as input but what you
 

00:23:02.220 --> 00:23:04.040
get a single map as input but what you
get you know multiple frames of label

00:23:04.040 --> 00:23:04.050
get you know multiple frames of label
 

00:23:04.050 --> 00:23:07.310
get you know multiple frames of label
Maps as input you also get past images

00:23:07.310 --> 00:23:07.320
Maps as input you also get past images
 

00:23:07.320 --> 00:23:09.080
Maps as input you also get past images
to be synthesized to actually know what

00:23:09.080 --> 00:23:09.090
to be synthesized to actually know what
 

00:23:09.090 --> 00:23:10.750
to be synthesized to actually know what
what's happened before

00:23:10.750 --> 00:23:10.760
what's happened before
 

00:23:10.760 --> 00:23:12.920
what's happened before
based on these we created an

00:23:12.920 --> 00:23:12.930
based on these we created an
 

00:23:12.930 --> 00:23:15.470
based on these we created an
intermediate output in addition we also

00:23:15.470 --> 00:23:15.480
intermediate output in addition we also
 

00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:18.230
intermediate output in addition we also
compute optical flow between the

00:23:18.230 --> 00:23:18.240
compute optical flow between the
 

00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:20.000
compute optical flow between the
previous images so we know how things

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:20.010
previous images so we know how things
 

00:23:20.010 --> 00:23:24.230
previous images so we know how things
have been moving we use the flow to warp

00:23:24.230 --> 00:23:24.240
have been moving we use the flow to warp
 

00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:27.140
have been moving we use the flow to warp
to warp the previous image into what the

00:23:27.140 --> 00:23:27.150
to warp the previous image into what the
 

00:23:27.150 --> 00:23:28.820
to warp the previous image into what the
next image could look like and then we

00:23:28.820 --> 00:23:28.830
next image could look like and then we
 

00:23:28.830 --> 00:23:31.640
next image could look like and then we
combine our synthesized image with the

00:23:31.640 --> 00:23:31.650
combine our synthesized image with the
 

00:23:31.650 --> 00:23:34.340
combine our synthesized image with the
protein with the warped image what it

00:23:34.340 --> 00:23:34.350
protein with the warped image what it
 

00:23:34.350 --> 00:23:36.080
protein with the warped image what it
might look like into a final image and

00:23:36.080 --> 00:23:36.090
might look like into a final image and
 

00:23:36.090 --> 00:23:38.090
might look like into a final image and
that helps I'm be obvious in network -

00:23:38.090 --> 00:23:38.100
that helps I'm be obvious in network -
 

00:23:38.100 --> 00:23:41.780
that helps I'm be obvious in network -
yeah - combine this then the trick of

00:23:41.780 --> 00:23:41.790
yeah - combine this then the trick of
 

00:23:41.790 --> 00:23:44.300
yeah - combine this then the trick of
using multiple scales for the

00:23:44.300 --> 00:23:44.310
using multiple scales for the
 

00:23:44.310 --> 00:23:45.590
using multiple scales for the
discriminator we use the same thing

00:23:45.590 --> 00:23:45.600
discriminator we use the same thing
 

00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:47.180
discriminator we use the same thing
again we do it not just spatially but

00:23:47.180 --> 00:23:47.190
again we do it not just spatially but
 

00:23:47.190 --> 00:23:49.100
again we do it not just spatially but
also temporally so when we discriminate

00:23:49.100 --> 00:23:49.110
also temporally so when we discriminate
 

00:23:49.110 --> 00:23:51.440
also temporally so when we discriminate
things we look at different spatial

00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:51.450
things we look at different spatial
 

00:23:51.450 --> 00:23:53.570
things we look at different spatial
resolutions but also different temporal

00:23:53.570 --> 00:23:53.580
resolutions but also different temporal
 

00:23:53.580 --> 00:23:55.070
resolutions but also different temporal
time frames we look at larger distances

00:23:55.070 --> 00:23:55.080
time frames we look at larger distances
 

00:23:55.080 --> 00:23:58.250
time frames we look at larger distances
as well as smaller distances the

00:23:58.250 --> 00:23:58.260
as well as smaller distances the
 

00:23:58.260 --> 00:24:00.530
as well as smaller distances the
training we still do progressive but we

00:24:00.530 --> 00:24:00.540
training we still do progressive but we
 

00:24:00.540 --> 00:24:02.540
training we still do progressive but we
don't just do it low resolution first

00:24:02.540 --> 00:24:02.550
don't just do it low resolution first
 

00:24:02.550 --> 00:24:04.760
don't just do it low resolution first
and high resolution but we do it low

00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:04.770
and high resolution but we do it low
 

00:24:04.770 --> 00:24:07.270
and high resolution but we do it low
resolution to high resolution as well as

00:24:07.270 --> 00:24:07.280
resolution to high resolution as well as
 

00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:10.550
resolution to high resolution as well as
temporally we do it sort of smaller

00:24:10.550 --> 00:24:10.560
temporally we do it sort of smaller
 

00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:13.370
temporally we do it sort of smaller
frames smaller temporal time steps and

00:24:13.370 --> 00:24:13.380
frames smaller temporal time steps and
 

00:24:13.380 --> 00:24:15.110
frames smaller temporal time steps and
then larger ones so we do it special

00:24:15.110 --> 00:24:15.120
then larger ones so we do it special
 

00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:16.700
then larger ones so we do it special
temporally progressive and then we

00:24:16.700 --> 00:24:16.710
temporally progressive and then we
 

00:24:16.710 --> 00:24:19.280
temporally progressive and then we
alternate between space and time when we

00:24:19.280 --> 00:24:19.290
alternate between space and time when we
 

00:24:19.290 --> 00:24:22.400
alternate between space and time when we
train so if you combine all this you can

00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:22.410
train so if you combine all this you can
 

00:24:22.410 --> 00:24:26.660
train so if you combine all this you can
now take this video

00:24:26.660 --> 00:24:26.670
 
 

00:24:26.670 --> 00:24:29.700
 
sorry went too far

00:24:29.700 --> 00:24:29.710
sorry went too far
 

00:24:29.710 --> 00:24:34.410
sorry went too far
take this video and turn it into a real

00:24:34.410 --> 00:24:34.420
take this video and turn it into a real
 

00:24:34.420 --> 00:24:36.770
take this video and turn it into a real
video in a second there you go

00:24:36.770 --> 00:24:36.780
video in a second there you go
 

00:24:36.780 --> 00:24:38.910
video in a second there you go
so you can see now it's temporally

00:24:38.910 --> 00:24:38.920
so you can see now it's temporally
 

00:24:38.920 --> 00:24:43.530
so you can see now it's temporally
consistent it is still not perfect if

00:24:43.530 --> 00:24:43.540
consistent it is still not perfect if
 

00:24:43.540 --> 00:24:45.510
consistent it is still not perfect if
you look carefully yeah you can see some

00:24:45.510 --> 00:24:45.520
you look carefully yeah you can see some
 

00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:46.950
you look carefully yeah you can see some
things are a little funky - trees seem a

00:24:46.950 --> 00:24:46.960
things are a little funky - trees seem a
 

00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:48.170
things are a little funky - trees seem a
little repetitive

00:24:48.170 --> 00:24:48.180
little repetitive
 

00:24:48.180 --> 00:24:59.910
little repetitive
the cars are glowing a little bit but

00:24:59.910 --> 00:24:59.920
the cars are glowing a little bit but
 

00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:03.470
the cars are glowing a little bit but
overall yeah it does let me play again

00:25:03.470 --> 00:25:03.480
overall yeah it does let me play again
 

00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:12.240
overall yeah it does let me play again
well it does a decent job when this is

00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:12.250
well it does a decent job when this is
 

00:25:12.250 --> 00:25:14.340
well it does a decent job when this is
on running on unseen label map so it

00:25:14.340 --> 00:25:14.350
on running on unseen label map so it
 

00:25:14.350 --> 00:25:15.840
on running on unseen label map so it
hasn't seen this particular sequence of

00:25:15.840 --> 00:25:15.850
hasn't seen this particular sequence of
 

00:25:15.850 --> 00:25:21.150
hasn't seen this particular sequence of
label maps of course right in this

00:25:21.150 --> 00:25:21.160
label maps of course right in this
 

00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:21.750

previous method bottom left that one was
also not meant for temporal sequences so

00:25:31.230 --> 00:25:31.240
also not meant for temporal sequences so
 

00:25:31.240 --> 00:25:36.440
also not meant for temporal sequences so
it also flickers and ours on the right

00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:36.450
 
 

00:25:36.450 --> 00:25:39.330
 
it does exit the autor surprisingly

00:25:39.330 --> 00:25:39.340
it does exit the autor surprisingly
 

00:25:39.340 --> 00:25:49.379
it does exit the autor surprisingly
decent job at synthesizing people

00:25:49.379 --> 00:25:49.389
 
 

00:25:49.389 --> 00:25:53.440
 
okay

00:25:53.440 --> 00:25:53.450
 
 

00:25:53.450 --> 00:25:56.539
 
now we can do the same thing for edges

00:25:56.539 --> 00:25:56.549
now we can do the same thing for edges
 

00:25:56.549 --> 00:25:58.730
now we can do the same thing for edges
so in this case we trained it on edges

00:25:58.730 --> 00:25:58.740
so in this case we trained it on edges
 

00:25:58.740 --> 00:26:02.600
so in this case we trained it on edges
and with yourself people since we have

00:26:02.600 --> 00:26:02.610
and with yourself people since we have
 

00:26:02.610 --> 00:26:05.149
and with yourself people since we have
to style or this is this multi-modality

00:26:05.149 --> 00:26:05.159
to style or this is this multi-modality
 

00:26:05.159 --> 00:26:06.950
to style or this is this multi-modality
where we look at you know what things

00:26:06.950 --> 00:26:06.960
where we look at you know what things
 

00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:09.980
where we look at you know what things
usually look like on average so yeah the

00:26:09.980 --> 00:26:09.990
usually look like on average so yeah the
 

00:26:09.990 --> 00:26:11.120
usually look like on average so yeah the
clustering figured out that's different

00:26:11.120 --> 00:26:11.130
clustering figured out that's different
 

00:26:11.130 --> 00:26:13.100
clustering figured out that's different
skin tones missed different hair colors

00:26:13.100 --> 00:26:13.110
skin tones missed different hair colors
 

00:26:13.110 --> 00:26:16.129
skin tones missed different hair colors
so now we can change skin tone and hair

00:26:16.129 --> 00:26:16.139
so now we can change skin tone and hair
 

00:26:16.139 --> 00:26:18.470
so now we can change skin tone and hair
color so input is just the edges on the

00:26:18.470 --> 00:26:18.480
color so input is just the edges on the
 

00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:20.330
color so input is just the edges on the
bottom left and we synthesize three

00:26:20.330 --> 00:26:20.340
bottom left and we synthesize three
 

00:26:20.340 --> 00:26:23.450
bottom left and we synthesize three
different well the same person three

00:26:23.450 --> 00:26:23.460
different well the same person three
 

00:26:23.460 --> 00:26:24.950
different well the same person three
times but with different hair and skin

00:26:24.950 --> 00:26:24.960
times but with different hair and skin
 

00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:35.989
times but with different hair and skin
tone

00:26:35.989 --> 00:26:35.999
 
 

00:26:35.999 --> 00:26:39.930
 
and here we've taken wages of someone

00:26:39.930 --> 00:26:39.940
and here we've taken wages of someone
 

00:26:39.940 --> 00:26:44.129
and here we've taken wages of someone
dancing so those examples of her dancing

00:26:44.129 --> 00:26:44.139
dancing so those examples of her dancing
 

00:26:44.139 --> 00:26:48.509
dancing so those examples of her dancing
and then yeah we extracted the pose and

00:26:48.509 --> 00:26:48.519
and then yeah we extracted the pose and
 

00:26:48.519 --> 00:26:50.700
and then yeah we extracted the pose and
then from this post we animated this

00:26:50.700 --> 00:26:50.710
then from this post we animated this
 

00:26:50.710 --> 00:26:53.940
then from this post we animated this
little colored figure and now we can

00:26:53.940 --> 00:26:53.950
little colored figure and now we can
 

00:26:53.950 --> 00:26:57.180
little colored figure and now we can
take new poses and since and go from the

00:26:57.180 --> 00:26:57.190
take new poses and since and go from the
 

00:26:57.190 --> 00:27:00.029
take new poses and since and go from the
colored figures figure to her dancing

00:27:00.029 --> 00:27:00.039
colored figures figure to her dancing
 

00:27:00.039 --> 00:27:02.519
colored figures figure to her dancing
again and you can see yeah if again you

00:27:02.519 --> 00:27:02.529
again and you can see yeah if again you
 

00:27:02.529 --> 00:27:07.200
again and you can see yeah if again you
look careful if you look careful it

00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:07.210
look careful if you look careful it
 

00:27:07.210 --> 00:27:08.940
look careful if you look careful it
works well ish

00:27:08.940 --> 00:27:08.950
works well ish
 

00:27:08.950 --> 00:27:11.369
works well ish
there's some places where yeah some

00:27:11.369 --> 00:27:11.379
there's some places where yeah some
 

00:27:11.379 --> 00:27:13.289
there's some places where yeah some
poses maybe it's not seen during

00:27:13.289 --> 00:27:13.299
poses maybe it's not seen during
 

00:27:13.299 --> 00:27:14.820
poses maybe it's not seen during
training so it doesn't quite know how to

00:27:14.820 --> 00:27:14.830
training so it doesn't quite know how to
 

00:27:14.830 --> 00:27:19.560
training so it doesn't quite know how to
do right the background wobbles

00:27:19.560 --> 00:27:19.570
do right the background wobbles
 

00:27:19.570 --> 00:27:27.570
do right the background wobbles
sometimes a little bit

00:27:27.570 --> 00:27:27.580
 
 

00:27:27.580 --> 00:27:31.399
 
but you know it's it's a start

00:27:31.399 --> 00:27:31.409
but you know it's it's a start
 

00:27:31.409 --> 00:27:34.440
but you know it's it's a start
also you notice that we use this colored

00:27:34.440 --> 00:27:34.450
also you notice that we use this colored
 

00:27:34.450 --> 00:27:36.269
also you notice that we use this colored
figure a previous label maps to are all

00:27:36.269 --> 00:27:36.279
figure a previous label maps to are all
 

00:27:36.279 --> 00:27:39.090
figure a previous label maps to are all
just uniformly colored right it just

00:27:39.090 --> 00:27:39.100
just uniformly colored right it just
 

00:27:39.100 --> 00:27:41.009
just uniformly colored right it just
said yeah this is the label for trees

00:27:41.009 --> 00:27:41.019
said yeah this is the label for trees
 

00:27:41.019 --> 00:27:42.659
said yeah this is the label for trees
this is the label for cars and so forth

00:27:42.659 --> 00:27:42.669
this is the label for cars and so forth
 

00:27:42.669 --> 00:27:44.879
this is the label for cars and so forth
here we did it slightly differently net

00:27:44.879 --> 00:27:44.889
here we did it slightly differently net
 

00:27:44.889 --> 00:27:46.409
here we did it slightly differently net
improved results so we have these

00:27:46.409 --> 00:27:46.419
improved results so we have these
 

00:27:46.419 --> 00:27:47.820
improved results so we have these
different colors and they're basically

00:27:47.820 --> 00:27:47.830
different colors and they're basically
 

00:27:47.830 --> 00:27:50.220
different colors and they're basically
UV coordinates like on the texture map

00:27:50.220 --> 00:27:50.230
UV coordinates like on the texture map
 

00:27:50.230 --> 00:27:52.739
UV coordinates like on the texture map
or like if you texture a person and it

00:27:52.739 --> 00:27:52.749
or like if you texture a person and it
 

00:27:52.749 --> 00:27:54.149
or like if you texture a person and it
helps to neural network to know what's

00:27:54.149 --> 00:27:54.159
helps to neural network to know what's
 

00:27:54.159 --> 00:27:56.340
helps to neural network to know what's
where alright so you can figure out what

00:27:56.340 --> 00:27:56.350
where alright so you can figure out what
 

00:27:56.350 --> 00:27:58.560
where alright so you can figure out what
what hands are it always knows which

00:27:58.560 --> 00:27:58.570
what hands are it always knows which
 

00:27:58.570 --> 00:28:00.119
what hands are it always knows which
part of the hand you're looking at and

00:28:00.119 --> 00:28:00.129
part of the hand you're looking at and
 

00:28:00.129 --> 00:28:02.009
part of the hand you're looking at and
it's same thing for all other body parts

00:28:02.009 --> 00:28:02.019
it's same thing for all other body parts
 

00:28:02.019 --> 00:28:06.330
it's same thing for all other body parts
so that helps quite a bit this the first

00:28:06.330 --> 00:28:06.340
so that helps quite a bit this the first
 

00:28:06.340 --> 00:28:08.159
so that helps quite a bit this the first
time we combine machine learning and

00:28:08.159 --> 00:28:08.169
time we combine machine learning and
 

00:28:08.169 --> 00:28:16.009
time we combine machine learning and
computer graph is to do I can't turn off

00:28:16.009 --> 00:28:16.019
 
 

00:28:16.019 --> 00:28:20.039
 
so this one was a NURBS so this is

00:28:20.039 --> 00:28:20.049
so this one was a NURBS so this is
 

00:28:20.049 --> 00:28:22.649
so this one was a NURBS so this is
actually running in real time so we take

00:28:22.649 --> 00:28:22.659
actually running in real time so we take
 

00:28:22.659 --> 00:28:26.099
actually running in real time so we take
as input a game engine that only outputs

00:28:26.099 --> 00:28:26.109
as input a game engine that only outputs
 

00:28:26.109 --> 00:28:28.409
as input a game engine that only outputs
label maps and then we take these label

00:28:28.409 --> 00:28:28.419
label maps and then we take these label
 

00:28:28.419 --> 00:28:30.930
label maps and then we take these label
maps and in real time we translate them

00:28:30.930 --> 00:28:30.940
maps and in real time we translate them
 

00:28:30.940 --> 00:28:33.239
maps and in real time we translate them
using they're not neural network and we

00:28:33.239 --> 00:28:33.249
using they're not neural network and we
 

00:28:33.249 --> 00:28:34.560
using they're not neural network and we
apply different styles and this is just

00:28:34.560 --> 00:28:34.570
apply different styles and this is just
 

00:28:34.570 --> 00:28:36.570
apply different styles and this is just
one example just a short example that I

00:28:36.570 --> 00:28:36.580
one example just a short example that I
 

00:28:36.580 --> 00:28:39.269
one example just a short example that I
found so it's really doing graphics

00:28:39.269 --> 00:28:39.279
found so it's really doing graphics
 

00:28:39.279 --> 00:28:41.489
found so it's really doing graphics
using yeah neural network so all the

00:28:41.489 --> 00:28:41.499
using yeah neural network so all the
 

00:28:41.499 --> 00:28:43.919
using yeah neural network so all the
textures and so forth everything comes

00:28:43.919 --> 00:28:43.929
textures and so forth everything comes
 

00:28:43.929 --> 00:28:45.930
textures and so forth everything comes
from the neural network it only sees

00:28:45.930 --> 00:28:45.940
from the neural network it only sees
 

00:28:45.940 --> 00:28:48.299
from the neural network it only sees
label maps that our game engine spits

00:28:48.299 --> 00:28:48.309
label maps that our game engine spits
 

00:28:48.309 --> 00:28:49.799
label maps that our game engine spits
out so the game engine is actually not

00:28:49.799 --> 00:28:49.809
out so the game engine is actually not
 

00:28:49.809 --> 00:28:51.389
out so the game engine is actually not
used to produce graphics it's only used

00:28:51.389 --> 00:28:51.399
used to produce graphics it's only used
 

00:28:51.399 --> 00:28:53.369
used to produce graphics it's only used
to produce label apps and you can take

00:28:53.369 --> 00:28:53.379
to produce label apps and you can take
 

00:28:53.379 --> 00:28:56.849
to produce label apps and you can take
it and produce like a game looking or

00:28:56.849 --> 00:28:56.859
it and produce like a game looking or
 

00:28:56.859 --> 00:29:05.279
it and produce like a game looking or
something like a game right okay so this

00:29:05.279 --> 00:29:05.289
something like a game right okay so this
 

00:29:05.289 --> 00:29:07.169
something like a game right okay so this
was all supervised learning so in this

00:29:07.169 --> 00:29:07.179
was all supervised learning so in this
 

00:29:07.179 --> 00:29:10.200
was all supervised learning so in this
case we always had yeah input examples

00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:10.210
case we always had yeah input examples
 

00:29:10.210 --> 00:29:11.609
case we always had yeah input examples
and what the output examples should look

00:29:11.609 --> 00:29:11.619
and what the output examples should look
 

00:29:11.619 --> 00:29:12.840
and what the output examples should look
like so we knew it for this particular

00:29:12.840 --> 00:29:12.850
like so we knew it for this particular
 

00:29:12.850 --> 00:29:14.940
like so we knew it for this particular
label map this particular output would

00:29:14.940 --> 00:29:14.950
label map this particular output would
 

00:29:14.950 --> 00:29:17.729
label map this particular output would
be desirable then this work it's just a

00:29:17.729 --> 00:29:17.739
be desirable then this work it's just a
 

00:29:17.739 --> 00:29:24.830
be desirable then this work it's just a
bit older we didn't use this we used we

00:29:24.830 --> 00:29:24.840
bit older we didn't use this we used we
 

00:29:24.840 --> 00:29:26.999
bit older we didn't use this we used we
tried to work with it in the

00:29:26.999 --> 00:29:27.009
tried to work with it in the
 

00:29:27.009 --> 00:29:28.349
tried to work with it in the
unsupervised case we're really we have

00:29:28.349 --> 00:29:28.359
unsupervised case we're really we have
 

00:29:28.359 --> 00:29:30.690
unsupervised case we're really we have
these two different data sets yeah like

00:29:30.690 --> 00:29:30.700
these two different data sets yeah like
 

00:29:30.700 --> 00:29:32.180
these two different data sets yeah like
the one on the Left no one on the right

00:29:32.180 --> 00:29:32.190
the one on the Left no one on the right
 

00:29:32.190 --> 00:29:35.669
the one on the Left no one on the right
that are separate it's not no one-to-one

00:29:35.669 --> 00:29:35.679
that are separate it's not no one-to-one
 

00:29:35.679 --> 00:29:37.649
that are separate it's not no one-to-one
correspondence between them they're just

00:29:37.649 --> 00:29:37.659
correspondence between them they're just
 

00:29:37.659 --> 00:29:40.440
correspondence between them they're just
happened to be similar except one is a

00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:40.450
happened to be similar except one is a
 

00:29:40.450 --> 00:29:42.120
happened to be similar except one is a
daytime and one is it

00:29:42.120 --> 00:29:42.130
daytime and one is it
 

00:29:42.130 --> 00:29:45.730
daytime and one is it
so now how can we yeah given that

00:29:45.730 --> 00:29:45.740
so now how can we yeah given that
 

00:29:45.740 --> 00:29:47.470
so now how can we yeah given that
there's no correspondents right how can

00:29:47.470 --> 00:29:47.480
there's no correspondents right how can
 

00:29:47.480 --> 00:29:50.289
there's no correspondents right how can
we train a neural network to take a

00:29:50.289 --> 00:29:50.299
we train a neural network to take a
 

00:29:50.299 --> 00:29:53.680
we train a neural network to take a
summer on in which taking it turn the

00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:53.690
summer on in which taking it turn the
 

00:29:53.690 --> 00:29:56.169
summer on in which taking it turn the
day and output an image during the night

00:29:56.169 --> 00:29:56.179
day and output an image during the night
 

00:29:56.179 --> 00:29:58.210
day and output an image during the night
that corresponds to it but it's at

00:29:58.210 --> 00:29:58.220
that corresponds to it but it's at
 

00:29:58.220 --> 00:30:01.570
that corresponds to it but it's at
nighttime right so if we let's say for a

00:30:01.570 --> 00:30:01.580
nighttime right so if we let's say for a
 

00:30:01.580 --> 00:30:03.940
nighttime right so if we let's say for a
moment all we do is we train again again

00:30:03.940 --> 00:30:03.950
moment all we do is we train again again
 

00:30:03.950 --> 00:30:08.500
moment all we do is we train again again
and we tell it here my input images

00:30:08.500 --> 00:30:08.510
and we tell it here my input images
 

00:30:08.510 --> 00:30:11.830
and we tell it here my input images
right based on this input image you have

00:30:11.830 --> 00:30:11.840
right based on this input image you have
 

00:30:11.840 --> 00:30:13.629
right based on this input image you have
to synthesize an output image it looks

00:30:13.629 --> 00:30:13.639
to synthesize an output image it looks
 

00:30:13.639 --> 00:30:16.560
to synthesize an output image it looks
similar to these other nighttime images

00:30:16.560 --> 00:30:16.570
similar to these other nighttime images
 

00:30:16.570 --> 00:30:19.600
similar to these other nighttime images
and it's all we tell it then what might

00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:19.610
and it's all we tell it then what might
 

00:30:19.610 --> 00:30:21.250
and it's all we tell it then what might
happen is the following

00:30:21.250 --> 00:30:21.260
happen is the following
 

00:30:21.260 --> 00:30:23.019
happen is the following
yeah I'm gonna yeah the generator it's

00:30:23.019 --> 00:30:23.029
yeah I'm gonna yeah the generator it's
 

00:30:23.029 --> 00:30:25.269
yeah I'm gonna yeah the generator it's
gonna generate things given the input

00:30:25.269 --> 00:30:25.279
gonna generate things given the input
 

00:30:25.279 --> 00:30:28.450
gonna generate things given the input
image x1 but there that are similar to

00:30:28.450 --> 00:30:28.460
image x1 but there that are similar to
 

00:30:28.460 --> 00:30:31.049
image x1 but there that are similar to
the distribution of the nighttime images

00:30:31.049 --> 00:30:31.059
the distribution of the nighttime images
 

00:30:31.059 --> 00:30:33.940
the distribution of the nighttime images
however it doesn't mean that there will

00:30:33.940 --> 00:30:33.950
however it doesn't mean that there will
 

00:30:33.950 --> 00:30:35.379
however it doesn't mean that there will
be a correspondence between the

00:30:35.379 --> 00:30:35.389
be a correspondence between the
 

00:30:35.389 --> 00:30:37.180
be a correspondence between the
synthesized night time image and the

00:30:37.180 --> 00:30:37.190
synthesized night time image and the
 

00:30:37.190 --> 00:30:38.919
synthesized night time image and the
input image right I didn't tell it that

00:30:38.919 --> 00:30:38.929
input image right I didn't tell it that
 

00:30:38.929 --> 00:30:40.480
input image right I didn't tell it that
they need to look alike all I said is

00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:40.490
they need to look alike all I said is
 

00:30:40.490 --> 00:30:42.909
they need to look alike all I said is
they need the night time in which images

00:30:42.909 --> 00:30:42.919
they need the night time in which images
 

00:30:42.919 --> 00:30:44.500
they need the night time in which images
need to look like nighttime images but

00:30:44.500 --> 00:30:44.510
need to look like nighttime images but
 

00:30:44.510 --> 00:30:45.850
need to look like nighttime images but
it didn't say it needs to look like a

00:30:45.850 --> 00:30:45.860
it didn't say it needs to look like a
 

00:30:45.860 --> 00:30:48.220
it didn't say it needs to look like a
nighttime image but also like the

00:30:48.220 --> 00:30:48.230
nighttime image but also like the
 

00:30:48.230 --> 00:30:49.720
nighttime image but also like the
original image right so what would

00:30:49.720 --> 00:30:49.730
original image right so what would
 

00:30:49.730 --> 00:30:51.909
original image right so what would
happen is given the state time in which

00:30:51.909 --> 00:30:51.919
happen is given the state time in which
 

00:30:51.919 --> 00:30:53.470
happen is given the state time in which
it'll just never would probably just

00:30:53.470 --> 00:30:53.480
it'll just never would probably just
 

00:30:53.480 --> 00:30:55.120
it'll just never would probably just
ignore this daytime image because it

00:30:55.120 --> 00:30:55.130
ignore this daytime image because it
 

00:30:55.130 --> 00:30:56.620
ignore this daytime image because it
doesn't really need it to produce a

00:30:56.620 --> 00:30:56.630
doesn't really need it to produce a
 

00:30:56.630 --> 00:30:57.940
doesn't really need it to produce a
nighttime in which it's just gonna

00:30:57.940 --> 00:30:57.950
nighttime in which it's just gonna
 

00:30:57.950 --> 00:31:00.190
nighttime in which it's just gonna
produce random nighttime images which is

00:31:00.190 --> 00:31:00.200
produce random nighttime images which is
 

00:31:00.200 --> 00:31:01.810
produce random nighttime images which is
not what we want but what we want is the

00:31:01.810 --> 00:31:01.820
not what we want but what we want is the
 

00:31:01.820 --> 00:31:05.200
not what we want but what we want is the
chute being correspondents so we make

00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:05.210
chute being correspondents so we make
 

00:31:05.210 --> 00:31:07.000
chute being correspondents so we make
this assumption what you call the shared

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:07.010
this assumption what you call the shared
 

00:31:07.010 --> 00:31:09.970
this assumption what you call the shared
latent space so again I want to create

00:31:09.970 --> 00:31:09.980
latent space so again I want to create
 

00:31:09.980 --> 00:31:11.560
latent space so again I want to create
an item which is actually responds to

00:31:11.560 --> 00:31:11.570
an item which is actually responds to
 

00:31:11.570 --> 00:31:13.389
an item which is actually responds to
the HMI which was just the case here

00:31:13.389 --> 00:31:13.399
the HMI which was just the case here
 

00:31:13.399 --> 00:31:15.430
the HMI which was just the case here
even though I've never seen different

00:31:15.430 --> 00:31:15.440
even though I've never seen different
 

00:31:15.440 --> 00:31:18.070
even though I've never seen different
correspondents so it makes the

00:31:18.070 --> 00:31:18.080
correspondents so it makes the
 

00:31:18.080 --> 00:31:20.139
correspondents so it makes the
assumption that there's some space in

00:31:20.139 --> 00:31:20.149
assumption that there's some space in
 

00:31:20.149 --> 00:31:22.629
assumption that there's some space in
which I can describe the scene I'm

00:31:22.629 --> 00:31:22.639
which I can describe the scene I'm
 

00:31:22.639 --> 00:31:24.940
which I can describe the scene I'm
currently in right so have if I take a

00:31:24.940 --> 00:31:24.950
currently in right so have if I take a
 

00:31:24.950 --> 00:31:28.480
currently in right so have if I take a
point in this latent space Z I can

00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:28.490
point in this latent space Z I can
 

00:31:28.490 --> 00:31:31.029
point in this latent space Z I can
somehow generate a daytime image as well

00:31:31.029 --> 00:31:31.039
somehow generate a daytime image as well
 

00:31:31.039 --> 00:31:32.500
somehow generate a daytime image as well
as a nighttime image and this light in

00:31:32.500 --> 00:31:32.510
as a nighttime image and this light in
 

00:31:32.510 --> 00:31:34.899
as a nighttime image and this light in
space is sufficient to describe either

00:31:34.899 --> 00:31:34.909
space is sufficient to describe either
 

00:31:34.909 --> 00:31:38.080
space is sufficient to describe either
one of them but what I have then is you

00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:38.090
one of them but what I have then is you
 

00:31:38.090 --> 00:31:40.090
one of them but what I have then is you
know different encoders ting can go from

00:31:40.090 --> 00:31:40.100
know different encoders ting can go from
 

00:31:40.100 --> 00:31:41.740
know different encoders ting can go from
a daytime image and encode it into this

00:31:41.740 --> 00:31:41.750
a daytime image and encode it into this
 

00:31:41.750 --> 00:31:43.240
a daytime image and encode it into this
latent space and they have different

00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:43.250
latent space and they have different
 

00:31:43.250 --> 00:31:46.060
latent space and they have different
generators that can take a code from

00:31:46.060 --> 00:31:46.070
generators that can take a code from
 

00:31:46.070 --> 00:31:47.889
generators that can take a code from
latent space and generate either daytime

00:31:47.889 --> 00:31:47.899
latent space and generate either daytime
 

00:31:47.899 --> 00:31:52.659
latent space and generate either daytime
or nighttime image so yeah if we want to

00:31:52.659 --> 00:31:52.669
or nighttime image so yeah if we want to
 

00:31:52.669 --> 00:31:54.690
or nighttime image so yeah if we want to
translate it then I can just use my echo

00:31:54.690 --> 00:31:54.700
translate it then I can just use my echo
 

00:31:54.700 --> 00:31:57.060
translate it then I can just use my echo
to encode from a daytime to the late in

00:31:57.060 --> 00:31:57.070
to encode from a daytime to the late in
 

00:31:57.070 --> 00:31:58.890
to encode from a daytime to the late in
space and I can use my generator to to

00:31:58.890 --> 00:31:58.900
space and I can use my generator to to
 

00:31:58.900 --> 00:32:02.820
space and I can use my generator to to
encode a night time of it but in

00:32:02.820 --> 00:32:02.830
encode a night time of it but in
 

00:32:02.830 --> 00:32:07.310
encode a night time of it but in
addition what we do is to fall we make

00:32:07.310 --> 00:32:07.320
addition what we do is to fall we make
 

00:32:07.320 --> 00:32:09.330
addition what we do is to fall we make
for these different encoders and

00:32:09.330 --> 00:32:09.340
for these different encoders and
 

00:32:09.340 --> 00:32:12.270
for these different encoders and
generators even though they're different

00:32:12.270 --> 00:32:12.280
generators even though they're different
 

00:32:12.280 --> 00:32:15.690
generators even though they're different
ones we share weights near the latent

00:32:15.690 --> 00:32:15.700
ones we share weights near the latent
 

00:32:15.700 --> 00:32:18.270
ones we share weights near the latent
space so the generator itself yeah

00:32:18.270 --> 00:32:18.280
space so the generator itself yeah
 

00:32:18.280 --> 00:32:20.580
space so the generator itself yeah
generate something then encodes it too

00:32:20.580 --> 00:32:20.590
generate something then encodes it too
 

00:32:20.590 --> 00:32:22.650
generate something then encodes it too
late in space and they the generator

00:32:22.650 --> 00:32:22.660
late in space and they the generator
 

00:32:22.660 --> 00:32:23.880
late in space and they the generator
takes it from the latent space and

00:32:23.880 --> 00:32:23.890
takes it from the latent space and
 

00:32:23.890 --> 00:32:26.940
takes it from the latent space and
encodes that sorry and creates an image

00:32:26.940 --> 00:32:26.950
encodes that sorry and creates an image
 

00:32:26.950 --> 00:32:29.220
encodes that sorry and creates an image
from it and the layers that are near

00:32:29.220 --> 00:32:29.230
from it and the layers that are near
 

00:32:29.230 --> 00:32:31.200
from it and the layers that are near
delayed in space we make them the same

00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:31.210
delayed in space we make them the same
 

00:32:31.210 --> 00:32:33.660
delayed in space we make them the same
for all encoders and generators and that

00:32:33.660 --> 00:32:33.670
for all encoders and generators and that
 

00:32:33.670 --> 00:32:35.640
for all encoders and generators and that
in itself is sufficient to make sure

00:32:35.640 --> 00:32:35.650
in itself is sufficient to make sure
 

00:32:35.650 --> 00:32:38.160
in itself is sufficient to make sure
that there is some similarity between

00:32:38.160 --> 00:32:38.170
that there is some similarity between
 

00:32:38.170 --> 00:32:41.460
that there is some similarity between
the input and the output so now what I

00:32:41.460 --> 00:32:41.470
the input and the output so now what I
 

00:32:41.470 --> 00:32:44.280
the input and the output so now what I
can do is after shared space I can go

00:32:44.280 --> 00:32:44.290
can do is after shared space I can go
 

00:32:44.290 --> 00:32:48.690
can do is after shared space I can go
between two different encoders and the

00:32:48.690 --> 00:32:48.700
between two different encoders and the
 

00:32:48.700 --> 00:32:51.170
between two different encoders and the
way you train it there's there's one

00:32:51.170 --> 00:32:51.180
way you train it there's there's one
 

00:32:51.180 --> 00:32:53.640
way you train it there's there's one
additional constraint that you know off

00:32:53.640 --> 00:32:53.650
additional constraint that you know off
 

00:32:53.650 --> 00:32:55.980
additional constraint that you know off
and that is if i encode an image and

00:32:55.980 --> 00:32:55.990
and that is if i encode an image and
 

00:32:55.990 --> 00:32:57.600
and that is if i encode an image and
they're decoded so I take a nighttime

00:32:57.600 --> 00:32:57.610
they're decoded so I take a nighttime
 

00:32:57.610 --> 00:33:00.090
they're decoded so I take a nighttime
image i encoded with my encoder and then

00:33:00.090 --> 00:33:00.100
image i encoded with my encoder and then
 

00:33:00.100 --> 00:33:01.620
image i encoded with my encoder and then
it decoded again with my nighttime

00:33:01.620 --> 00:33:01.630
it decoded again with my nighttime
 

00:33:01.630 --> 00:33:03.330
it decoded again with my nighttime
encoder it should correspond to the

00:33:03.330 --> 00:33:03.340
encoder it should correspond to the
 

00:33:03.340 --> 00:33:04.830
encoder it should correspond to the
original image right all I did is so

00:33:04.830 --> 00:33:04.840
original image right all I did is so
 

00:33:04.840 --> 00:33:06.240
original image right all I did is so
went to the late in space I'm going back

00:33:06.240 --> 00:33:06.250
went to the late in space I'm going back
 

00:33:06.250 --> 00:33:08.280
went to the late in space I'm going back
to the same domain I should be able to

00:33:08.280 --> 00:33:08.290
to the same domain I should be able to
 

00:33:08.290 --> 00:33:08.700
to the same domain I should be able to
it

00:33:08.700 --> 00:33:08.710
it
 

00:33:08.710 --> 00:33:10.290
it
yeah encoded correctly and the same

00:33:10.290 --> 00:33:10.300
yeah encoded correctly and the same
 

00:33:10.300 --> 00:33:13.320
yeah encoded correctly and the same
thing for the daytime image and those

00:33:13.320 --> 00:33:13.330
thing for the daytime image and those
 

00:33:13.330 --> 00:33:15.960
thing for the daytime image and those
constraints itself there sufficient to

make this work so now here is input and

00:33:19.680 --> 00:33:19.690
make this work so now here is input and

yeah somewhere so it's almost just adds

00:33:47.940 --> 00:33:47.950
yeah somewhere so it's almost just adds

yeah somewhere so it's almost just adds
lights randomly in the sky it's learned

00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:50.650
lights randomly in the sky it's learned
 

00:33:50.650 --> 00:33:57.350
lights randomly in the sky it's learned
that that's common

00:33:57.350 --> 00:33:57.360
 
 

00:33:57.360 --> 00:34:00.470
 
I also learned that the cars usually all

00:34:00.470 --> 00:34:00.480
I also learned that the cars usually all
 

00:34:00.480 --> 00:34:02.930
I also learned that the cars usually all
look black or dark at night whereas the

00:34:02.930 --> 00:34:02.940
look black or dark at night whereas the
 

00:34:02.940 --> 00:34:07.820
look black or dark at night whereas the
taillights might be red or white so this

00:34:07.820 --> 00:34:07.830
taillights might be red or white so this
 

00:34:07.830 --> 00:34:10.340
taillights might be red or white so this
is going day tonight I can do the same

00:34:10.340 --> 00:34:10.350
is going day tonight I can do the same
 

00:34:10.350 --> 00:34:14.510
is going day tonight I can do the same
thing for winter to summer so in this

00:34:14.510 --> 00:34:14.520
thing for winter to summer so in this
 

00:34:14.520 --> 00:34:17.090
thing for winter to summer so in this
case here we have training for driving

00:34:17.090 --> 00:34:17.100
case here we have training for driving
 

00:34:17.100 --> 00:34:18.860
case here we have training for driving
videos of during the winter driving

00:34:18.860 --> 00:34:18.870
videos of during the winter driving
 

00:34:18.870 --> 00:34:22.010
videos of during the winter driving
videos in the summer and it learns to go

00:34:22.010 --> 00:34:22.020
videos in the summer and it learns to go
 

00:34:22.020 --> 00:34:25.639
videos in the summer and it learns to go
yeah really from winter to summer and it

00:34:25.639 --> 00:34:25.649
yeah really from winter to summer and it
 

00:34:25.649 --> 00:34:27.380
yeah really from winter to summer and it
learns this on its own and I'll show you

00:34:27.380 --> 00:34:27.390
learns this on its own and I'll show you
 

00:34:27.390 --> 00:34:30.110
learns this on its own and I'll show you
some funky thinks that it's learned so

00:34:30.110 --> 00:34:30.120
some funky thinks that it's learned so
 

00:34:30.120 --> 00:34:31.790
some funky thinks that it's learned so
you'll you'll see what it learns that

00:34:31.790 --> 00:34:31.800
you'll you'll see what it learns that
 

00:34:31.800 --> 00:34:33.830
you'll you'll see what it learns that
vertical structures are usually trees

00:34:33.830 --> 00:34:33.840
vertical structures are usually trees
 

00:34:33.840 --> 00:34:35.720
vertical structures are usually trees
right but it doesn't really know that

00:34:35.720 --> 00:34:35.730
right but it doesn't really know that
 

00:34:35.730 --> 00:34:37.370
right but it doesn't really know that
it's a difference between these

00:34:37.370 --> 00:34:37.380
it's a difference between these
 

00:34:37.380 --> 00:34:40.639
it's a difference between these
electricity posts and trees so sometimes

00:34:40.639 --> 00:34:40.649
electricity posts and trees so sometimes
 

00:34:40.649 --> 00:34:43.460
electricity posts and trees so sometimes
it puts leaves on those because it looks

00:34:43.460 --> 00:34:43.470
it puts leaves on those because it looks
 

00:34:43.470 --> 00:34:46.040
it puts leaves on those because it looks
a bit like a tree right so it thinks

00:34:46.040 --> 00:34:46.050
a bit like a tree right so it thinks
 

00:34:46.050 --> 00:34:47.389
a bit like a tree right so it thinks
well yeah the other things have leaves

00:34:47.389 --> 00:34:47.399
well yeah the other things have leaves
 

00:34:47.399 --> 00:34:50.530
well yeah the other things have leaves
so maybe they should have leaves as well

00:34:50.530 --> 00:34:50.540
so maybe they should have leaves as well
 

00:34:50.540 --> 00:34:54.919
so maybe they should have leaves as well
which is not a bad yeah not a bad thing

00:34:54.919 --> 00:34:54.929
which is not a bad yeah not a bad thing
 

00:34:54.929 --> 00:34:56.750
which is not a bad yeah not a bad thing
to think here again you can see put

00:34:56.750 --> 00:34:56.760
to think here again you can see put
 

00:34:56.760 --> 00:34:59.120
to think here again you can see put
leaves on them but it also learns that

00:34:59.120 --> 00:34:59.130
leaves on them but it also learns that
 

00:34:59.130 --> 00:35:01.510
leaves on them but it also learns that
where there's snow in the winter right

00:35:01.510 --> 00:35:01.520
where there's snow in the winter right
 

00:35:01.520 --> 00:35:03.950
where there's snow in the winter right
yeah I should remove it so you know

00:35:03.950 --> 00:35:03.960
yeah I should remove it so you know
 

00:35:03.960 --> 00:35:06.500
yeah I should remove it so you know
usually puts some dirt color there or

00:35:06.500 --> 00:35:06.510
usually puts some dirt color there or
 

00:35:06.510 --> 00:35:09.740
usually puts some dirt color there or
some you know some grass color which is

00:35:09.740 --> 00:35:09.750
some you know some grass color which is
 

00:35:09.750 --> 00:35:11.750
some you know some grass color which is
quite interesting so it derives all this

00:35:11.750 --> 00:35:11.760
quite interesting so it derives all this
 

00:35:11.760 --> 00:35:14.450
quite interesting so it derives all this
on its own right nobody told it that you

00:35:14.450 --> 00:35:14.460
on its own right nobody told it that you
 

00:35:14.460 --> 00:35:16.370
on its own right nobody told it that you
know these are trees and and snow

00:35:16.370 --> 00:35:16.380
know these are trees and and snow
 

00:35:16.380 --> 00:35:17.810
know these are trees and and snow
disappears and it's armored it learned

00:35:17.810 --> 00:35:17.820
disappears and it's armored it learned
 

00:35:17.820 --> 00:35:21.710
disappears and it's armored it learned
that this is what usually happens and

00:35:21.710 --> 00:35:21.720
that this is what usually happens and
 

00:35:21.720 --> 00:35:24.140
that this is what usually happens and
this series goes from sunny to rainy

00:35:24.140 --> 00:35:24.150
this series goes from sunny to rainy
 

00:35:24.150 --> 00:35:27.290
this series goes from sunny to rainy
again it's learned that the sky is

00:35:27.290 --> 00:35:27.300
again it's learned that the sky is
 

00:35:27.300 --> 00:35:30.410
again it's learned that the sky is
usually more grave and it rains yeah

00:35:30.410 --> 00:35:30.420
usually more grave and it rains yeah
 

00:35:30.420 --> 00:35:33.350
usually more grave and it rains yeah
usually and usually there's reflections

00:35:33.350 --> 00:35:33.360
usually and usually there's reflections
 

00:35:33.360 --> 00:35:35.960
usually and usually there's reflections
on the road so it makes all roads

00:35:35.960 --> 00:35:35.970
on the road so it makes all roads
 

00:35:35.970 --> 00:35:38.930
on the road so it makes all roads
slightly reflective I also learned that

00:35:38.930 --> 00:35:38.940
slightly reflective I also learned that
 

00:35:38.940 --> 00:35:40.670
slightly reflective I also learned that
things are slightly more hazy when it's

00:35:40.670 --> 00:35:40.680
things are slightly more hazy when it's
 

00:35:40.680 --> 00:35:45.580
things are slightly more hazy when it's
raining so I did that

00:35:45.580 --> 00:35:45.590
 
 

00:35:45.590 --> 00:35:48.320
 
it also learned that which is actually

00:35:48.320 --> 00:35:48.330
it also learned that which is actually
 

00:35:48.330 --> 00:35:51.650
it also learned that which is actually
interesting that near taillights there's

00:35:51.650 --> 00:35:51.660
interesting that near taillights there's
 

00:35:51.660 --> 00:35:53.720
interesting that near taillights there's
often a red halo around them because of

00:35:53.720 --> 00:35:53.730
often a red halo around them because of
 

00:35:53.730 --> 00:35:55.910
often a red halo around them because of
the mist all right so you can see makes

00:35:55.910 --> 00:35:55.920
the mist all right so you can see makes
 

00:35:55.920 --> 00:35:58.970
the mist all right so you can see makes
this brighter but then it doesn't really

00:35:58.970 --> 00:35:58.980
this brighter but then it doesn't really
 

00:35:58.980 --> 00:36:01.580
this brighter but then it doesn't really
know to distinguish red car from tail

00:36:01.580 --> 00:36:01.590
know to distinguish red car from tail
 

00:36:01.590 --> 00:36:02.900
know to distinguish red car from tail
light so there's a red car and now

00:36:02.900 --> 00:36:02.910
light so there's a red car and now
 

00:36:02.910 --> 00:36:04.550
light so there's a red car and now
become sir has just it's like glow

00:36:04.550 --> 00:36:04.560
become sir has just it's like glow
 

00:36:04.560 --> 00:36:05.930
become sir has just it's like glow
around it because it also things it's

00:36:05.930 --> 00:36:05.940
around it because it also things it's
 

00:36:05.940 --> 00:36:11.020
around it because it also things it's
like a tail light

00:36:11.020 --> 00:36:11.030
 
 

00:36:11.030 --> 00:36:14.060
 
again overall given that it's only seen

00:36:14.060 --> 00:36:14.070
again overall given that it's only seen
 

00:36:14.070 --> 00:36:15.800
again overall given that it's only seen
two separate data sets that are not in

00:36:15.800 --> 00:36:15.810
two separate data sets that are not in
 

00:36:15.810 --> 00:36:17.570
two separate data sets that are not in
correspondence it's managed to figure

00:36:17.570 --> 00:36:17.580
correspondence it's managed to figure
 

00:36:17.580 --> 00:36:19.220
correspondence it's managed to figure
out now that the road should be more you

00:36:19.220 --> 00:36:19.230
out now that the road should be more you
 

00:36:19.230 --> 00:36:21.109
out now that the road should be more you
know more shiny or more reflective this

00:36:21.109 --> 00:36:21.119
know more shiny or more reflective this
 

00:36:21.119 --> 00:36:23.150
know more shiny or more reflective this
guy should be more great and all of this

00:36:23.150 --> 00:36:23.160
guy should be more great and all of this
 

00:36:23.160 --> 00:36:24.890
guy should be more great and all of this
was done overnight automatically right

00:36:24.890 --> 00:36:24.900
was done overnight automatically right
 

00:36:24.900 --> 00:36:26.330
was done overnight automatically right
nobody told it that that's what it's

00:36:26.330 --> 00:36:26.340
nobody told it that that's what it's
 

00:36:26.340 --> 00:36:31.370
nobody told it that that's what it's
going to be so this was a unimodal

00:36:31.370 --> 00:36:31.380
going to be so this was a unimodal
 

00:36:31.380 --> 00:36:32.839
going to be so this was a unimodal
translation so you could only create one

00:36:32.839 --> 00:36:32.849
translation so you could only create one
 

00:36:32.849 --> 00:36:35.060
translation so you could only create one
output all right not multiple different

00:36:35.060 --> 00:36:35.070
output all right not multiple different
 

00:36:35.070 --> 00:36:38.210
output all right not multiple different
outputs then we have an extension of

00:36:38.210 --> 00:36:38.220
outputs then we have an extension of
 

00:36:38.220 --> 00:36:40.310
outputs then we have an extension of
this work which again is unsupervised

00:36:40.310 --> 00:36:40.320
this work which again is unsupervised
 

00:36:40.320 --> 00:36:43.609
this work which again is unsupervised
but it allows to output things in a

00:36:43.609 --> 00:36:43.619
but it allows to output things in a
 

00:36:43.619 --> 00:36:45.260
but it allows to output things in a
multi-modal fashion so you can change

00:36:45.260 --> 00:36:45.270
multi-modal fashion so you can change
 

00:36:45.270 --> 00:36:48.109
multi-modal fashion so you can change
the style of the output and it works

00:36:48.109 --> 00:36:48.119
the style of the output and it works
 

00:36:48.119 --> 00:36:51.710
the style of the output and it works
very similar to before again we have an

00:36:51.710 --> 00:36:51.720
very similar to before again we have an
 

00:36:51.720 --> 00:36:53.060
very similar to before again we have an
encoder that goes into some shared

00:36:53.060 --> 00:36:53.070
encoder that goes into some shared
 

00:36:53.070 --> 00:36:55.730
encoder that goes into some shared
latent space but in and then you can

00:36:55.730 --> 00:36:55.740
latent space but in and then you can
 

00:36:55.740 --> 00:36:56.900
latent space but in and then you can
come from this Leighton space and

00:36:56.900 --> 00:36:56.910
come from this Leighton space and
 

00:36:56.910 --> 00:37:00.010
come from this Leighton space and
generate an out but in addition though

00:37:00.010 --> 00:37:00.020
generate an out but in addition though
 

00:37:00.020 --> 00:37:02.839
generate an out but in addition though
we have two styl encoders where we

00:37:02.839 --> 00:37:02.849
we have two styl encoders where we
 

00:37:02.849 --> 00:37:04.339
we have two styl encoders where we
automatically try and learn what the

00:37:04.339 --> 00:37:04.349
automatically try and learn what the
 

00:37:04.349 --> 00:37:07.160
automatically try and learn what the
style looks like of something that's

00:37:07.160 --> 00:37:07.170
style looks like of something that's
 

00:37:07.170 --> 00:37:09.530
style looks like of something that's
being coded and when it decoded I can

00:37:09.530 --> 00:37:09.540
being coded and when it decoded I can
 

00:37:09.540 --> 00:37:11.030
being coded and when it decoded I can
give it a style and the decoder should

00:37:11.030 --> 00:37:11.040
give it a style and the decoder should
 

00:37:11.040 --> 00:37:13.550
give it a style and the decoder should
adhere to the style a given so it could

00:37:13.550 --> 00:37:13.560
adhere to the style a given so it could
 

00:37:13.560 --> 00:37:15.859
adhere to the style a given so it could
be things like yeah I'm translating st.

00:37:15.859 --> 00:37:15.869
be things like yeah I'm translating st.
 

00:37:15.869 --> 00:37:18.589
be things like yeah I'm translating st.
leopards or Lions whatever it is to cats

00:37:18.589 --> 00:37:18.599
leopards or Lions whatever it is to cats
 

00:37:18.599 --> 00:37:21.849
leopards or Lions whatever it is to cats
I can have different styles during the

00:37:21.849 --> 00:37:21.859
I can have different styles during the
 

00:37:21.859 --> 00:37:24.410
I can have different styles during the
generation part and the different styles

00:37:24.410 --> 00:37:24.420
generation part and the different styles
 

00:37:24.420 --> 00:37:26.570
generation part and the different styles
correspond yeah to different cats but

00:37:26.570 --> 00:37:26.580
correspond yeah to different cats but
 

00:37:26.580 --> 00:37:28.190
correspond yeah to different cats but
they're all cats in the same pose just

00:37:28.190 --> 00:37:28.200
they're all cats in the same pose just
 

00:37:28.200 --> 00:37:30.589
they're all cats in the same pose just
yeah the different they're looking

00:37:30.589 --> 00:37:30.599
yeah the different they're looking
 

00:37:30.599 --> 00:37:34.700
yeah the different they're looking
different but it's overall it's very

00:37:34.700 --> 00:37:34.710
different but it's overall it's very
 

00:37:34.710 --> 00:37:37.250
different but it's overall it's very
similar to you know except yeah all this

00:37:37.250 --> 00:37:37.260
similar to you know except yeah all this
 

00:37:37.260 --> 00:37:38.630
similar to you know except yeah all this
the same except there's this additional

00:37:38.630 --> 00:37:38.640
the same except there's this additional
 

00:37:38.640 --> 00:37:42.170
the same except there's this additional
styling coder that we use and we play

00:37:42.170 --> 00:37:42.180
styling coder that we use and we play
 

00:37:42.180 --> 00:37:43.400
styling coder that we use and we play
the same trick that we played before

00:37:43.400 --> 00:37:43.410
the same trick that we played before
 

00:37:43.410 --> 00:37:45.440
the same trick that we played before
that you know if i encode something with

00:37:45.440 --> 00:37:45.450
that you know if i encode something with
 

00:37:45.450 --> 00:37:47.599
that you know if i encode something with
the style and decode with this file with

00:37:47.599 --> 00:37:47.609
the style and decode with this file with
 

00:37:47.609 --> 00:37:49.510
the style and decode with this file with
the same style it should look the same

00:37:49.510 --> 00:37:49.520
the same style it should look the same
 

00:37:49.520 --> 00:37:52.310
the same style it should look the same
and again that sort of sufficient to

00:37:52.310 --> 00:37:52.320
and again that sort of sufficient to
 

00:37:52.320 --> 00:37:54.970
and again that sort of sufficient to
make this all work

00:37:54.970 --> 00:37:54.980
make this all work
 

00:37:54.980 --> 00:37:58.210
make this all work
the structure is very similar to before

00:37:58.210 --> 00:37:58.220
the structure is very similar to before
 

00:37:58.220 --> 00:38:01.310
the structure is very similar to before
except now we used two bit more advanced

00:38:01.310 --> 00:38:01.320
except now we used two bit more advanced
 

00:38:01.320 --> 00:38:03.710
except now we used two bit more advanced
network with residual blocks you know a

00:38:03.710 --> 00:38:03.720
network with residual blocks you know a
 

00:38:03.720 --> 00:38:05.300
network with residual blocks you know a

before for the style encoder we used
 

00:38:09.420 --> 00:38:10.970
before for the style encoder we used

this trick which is called ADA and which
 

00:38:10.980 --> 00:38:12.849
this trick which is called ADA and which
is adaptive instance arm realization

cases so what can I do with this so in
 

00:38:29.670 --> 00:38:32.269

this case we've create a synthetic say
 

00:38:32.279 --> 00:38:33.859
this case we've create a synthetic say
that data said so we actually know what

correspondences we actually have
 

00:38:39.119 --> 00:38:40.940
correspondences we actually have
correspondences so we have inputs of

00:38:40.940 --> 00:38:40.950
correspondences so we have inputs of
 

00:38:40.950 --> 00:38:45.410

images of shoes but only their edges and

00:38:45.410 --> 00:38:45.420
images of shoes but only their edges and
 

00:38:45.420 --> 00:38:47.720
images of shoes but only their edges and
we also have the apparent truth images

00:38:47.720 --> 00:38:47.730
we also have the apparent truth images
 

00:38:47.730 --> 00:38:49.309
we also have the apparent truth images
for them even though we trained it in an

for them even though we trained it in an
 

00:38:49.319 --> 00:38:52.039
for them even though we trained it in an
unsupervised fashion and now I can ask

00:38:52.039 --> 00:38:52.049
unsupervised fashion and now I can ask
 

00:38:52.049 --> 00:38:55.430
unsupervised fashion and now I can ask
it they're never given this image of

00:38:55.430 --> 00:38:55.440
it they're never given this image of
 

00:38:55.440 --> 00:38:58.729
it they're never given this image of
shoes I saw edges give me example shoes

00:38:58.729 --> 00:38:58.739
shoes I saw edges give me example shoes
 

00:38:58.739 --> 00:39:00.650
shoes I saw edges give me example shoes
and I'll go through different styles and

00:39:00.650 --> 00:39:00.660
and I'll go through different styles and
 

00:39:00.660 --> 00:39:03.140
and I'll go through different styles and
it's gonna give me shoes that all adhere

00:39:03.140 --> 00:39:03.150
it's gonna give me shoes that all adhere
 

00:39:03.150 --> 00:39:05.690
it's gonna give me shoes that all adhere
to the edges but of different colors

00:39:05.690 --> 00:39:05.700
to the edges but of different colors
 

00:39:05.700 --> 00:39:06.950
to the edges but of different colors
right and they're sensible

00:39:06.950 --> 00:39:06.960
right and they're sensible
 

00:39:06.960 --> 00:39:09.680
right and they're sensible
so it's learn the sensible styles of

00:39:09.680 --> 00:39:09.690
so it's learn the sensible styles of
 

00:39:09.690 --> 00:39:27.079
so it's learn the sensible styles of
shoes yes it's yes it's not it's not

00:39:27.079 --> 00:39:27.089
shoes yes it's yes it's not it's not
 

00:39:27.089 --> 00:39:29.660
shoes yes it's yes it's not it's not
entirely obvious so for if you ignore

00:39:29.660 --> 00:39:29.670
entirely obvious so for if you ignore
 

00:39:29.670 --> 00:39:32.269
entirely obvious so for if you ignore
the style for a moment it really is this

00:39:32.269 --> 00:39:32.279
the style for a moment it really is this
 

00:39:32.279 --> 00:39:35.299
the style for a moment it really is this
really only one two constraints one is

00:39:35.299 --> 00:39:35.309
really only one two constraints one is
 

00:39:35.309 --> 00:39:39.680
really only one two constraints one is
that if i encode myself right and

00:39:39.680 --> 00:39:39.690
that if i encode myself right and
 

00:39:39.690 --> 00:39:41.630
that if i encode myself right and
decoded myself against with the same

00:39:41.630 --> 00:39:41.640
decoded myself against with the same
 

00:39:41.640 --> 00:39:44.140
decoded myself against with the same
with a corresponding encoded decoder or

00:39:44.140 --> 00:39:44.150
with a corresponding encoded decoder or
 

00:39:44.150 --> 00:39:47.479
with a corresponding encoded decoder or
encoder generator then you have a day

00:39:47.479 --> 00:39:47.489
encoder generator then you have a day
 

00:39:47.489 --> 00:39:49.190
encoder generator then you have a day
time in which i want the same day time

00:39:49.190 --> 00:39:49.200
time in which i want the same day time
 

00:39:49.200 --> 00:39:51.049
time in which i want the same day time
image back right that's your work and if

00:39:51.049 --> 00:39:51.059
image back right that's your work and if
 

00:39:51.059 --> 00:39:52.400
image back right that's your work and if
ever nighttime image i should get the

00:39:52.400 --> 00:39:52.410
ever nighttime image i should get the
 

00:39:52.410 --> 00:39:55.400
ever nighttime image i should get the
same night time of inch back so that's

00:39:55.400 --> 00:39:55.410
same night time of inch back so that's
 

00:39:55.410 --> 00:39:57.349
same night time of inch back so that's
the main constraint in addition when you

00:39:57.349 --> 00:39:57.359
the main constraint in addition when you
 

00:39:57.359 --> 00:39:59.059
the main constraint in addition when you
think the other sort of encoder for

00:39:59.059 --> 00:39:59.069
think the other sort of encoder for
 

00:39:59.069 --> 00:40:00.650
think the other sort of encoder for
daytime encoder for night time which is

00:40:00.650 --> 00:40:00.660
daytime encoder for night time which is
 

00:40:00.660 --> 00:40:02.749
daytime encoder for night time which is
generator for daytime which generator

00:40:02.749 --> 00:40:02.759
generator for daytime which generator
 

00:40:02.759 --> 00:40:05.660
generator for daytime which generator
for nighttime and which is these all

00:40:05.660 --> 00:40:05.670
for nighttime and which is these all
 

00:40:05.670 --> 00:40:07.339
for nighttime and which is these all
neural networks but each one is a neural

00:40:07.339 --> 00:40:07.349
neural networks but each one is a neural
 

00:40:07.349 --> 00:40:09.680
neural networks but each one is a neural
network the neural networks they share

00:40:09.680 --> 00:40:09.690
network the neural networks they share
 

00:40:09.690 --> 00:40:12.319
network the neural networks they share
weights near the latent space so it's

00:40:12.319 --> 00:40:12.329
weights near the latent space so it's
 

00:40:12.329 --> 00:40:15.559
weights near the latent space so it's
the same identical weights so the

00:40:15.559 --> 00:40:15.569
the same identical weights so the
 

00:40:15.569 --> 00:40:18.109
the same identical weights so the
encoders need to serve the beginning of

00:40:18.109 --> 00:40:18.119
encoders need to serve the beginning of
 

00:40:18.119 --> 00:40:19.849
encoders need to serve the beginning of
the encoders they do something that's

00:40:19.849 --> 00:40:19.859
the encoders they do something that's
 

00:40:19.859 --> 00:40:21.680
the encoders they do something that's
domain-specific to daytime or nighttime

00:40:21.680 --> 00:40:21.690
domain-specific to daytime or nighttime
 

00:40:21.690 --> 00:40:23.499
domain-specific to daytime or nighttime
but then once they're sort of near the

00:40:23.499 --> 00:40:23.509
but then once they're sort of near the
 

00:40:23.509 --> 00:40:25.970
but then once they're sort of near the
latent space they have the same weights

00:40:25.970 --> 00:40:25.980
latent space they have the same weights
 

00:40:25.980 --> 00:40:29.660
latent space they have the same weights
so there's some kind of will force them

00:40:29.660 --> 00:40:29.670
so there's some kind of will force them
 

00:40:29.670 --> 00:40:32.539
so there's some kind of will force them
to be in a space that's similar so at

00:40:32.539 --> 00:40:32.549
to be in a space that's similar so at
 

00:40:32.549 --> 00:40:34.279
to be in a space that's similar so at
that point it's independent if it's

00:40:34.279 --> 00:40:34.289
that point it's independent if it's
 

00:40:34.289 --> 00:40:35.599
that point it's independent if it's
daytime or nighttime in the same

00:40:35.599 --> 00:40:35.609
daytime or nighttime in the same
 

00:40:35.609 --> 00:40:37.910
daytime or nighttime in the same
for the generator at that point at the

00:40:37.910 --> 00:40:37.920
for the generator at that point at the
 

00:40:37.920 --> 00:40:39.079
for the generator at that point at the
beginning when they start generating

00:40:39.079 --> 00:40:39.089
beginning when they start generating
 

00:40:39.089 --> 00:40:41.089
beginning when they start generating
things it's the same way it's either

00:40:41.089 --> 00:40:41.099
things it's the same way it's either
 

00:40:41.099 --> 00:40:43.069
things it's the same way it's either
independent of daytime or nighttime and

00:40:43.069 --> 00:40:43.079
independent of daytime or nighttime and
 

00:40:43.079 --> 00:40:45.079
independent of daytime or nighttime and
then we have sort of the specific

00:40:45.079 --> 00:40:45.089
then we have sort of the specific
 

00:40:45.089 --> 00:40:46.670
then we have sort of the specific
weights to daytime and tonight them

00:40:46.670 --> 00:40:46.680
weights to daytime and tonight them
 

00:40:46.680 --> 00:40:49.489
weights to daytime and tonight them
which is the the reason why they're in

00:40:49.489 --> 00:40:49.499
which is the the reason why they're in
 

00:40:49.499 --> 00:40:51.019
which is the the reason why they're in
correspondence and that's really the

00:40:51.019 --> 00:40:51.029
correspondence and that's really the
 

00:40:51.029 --> 00:40:58.819
correspondence and that's really the
main reason the Train yeah but we train

00:40:58.819 --> 00:40:58.829
main reason the Train yeah but we train
 

00:40:58.829 --> 00:41:01.130
main reason the Train yeah but we train
them we just make sure yeah we've forced

00:41:01.130 --> 00:41:01.140
them we just make sure yeah we've forced
 

00:41:01.140 --> 00:41:03.430
them we just make sure yeah we've forced
him to be the same during training

00:41:03.430 --> 00:41:03.440
him to be the same during training
 

00:41:03.440 --> 00:41:06.949
him to be the same during training
actually the main the main inside and

00:41:06.949 --> 00:41:06.959
actually the main the main inside and
 

00:41:06.959 --> 00:41:09.140
actually the main the main inside and
yet the same the same here again except

00:41:09.140 --> 00:41:09.150
yet the same the same here again except
 

00:41:09.150 --> 00:41:12.219
yet the same the same here again except
with the addition of two style encoder

00:41:12.219 --> 00:41:12.229
with the addition of two style encoder
 

00:41:12.229 --> 00:41:18.799
with the addition of two style encoder
right what so no yeah I can create all

00:41:18.799 --> 00:41:18.809
right what so no yeah I can create all
 

00:41:18.809 --> 00:41:20.239
right what so no yeah I can create all
kind of shoes I can do it same thing for

00:41:20.239 --> 00:41:20.249
kind of shoes I can do it same thing for
 

00:41:20.249 --> 00:41:21.949
kind of shoes I can do it same thing for
bags and it learns the interesting

00:41:21.949 --> 00:41:21.959
bags and it learns the interesting
 

00:41:21.959 --> 00:41:24.279
bags and it learns the interesting
styles right so you can translate yeah

00:41:24.279 --> 00:41:24.289
styles right so you can translate yeah
 

00:41:24.289 --> 00:41:27.109
styles right so you can translate yeah
this image of edges of a back into the

00:41:27.109 --> 00:41:27.119
this image of edges of a back into the
 

00:41:27.119 --> 00:41:30.289
this image of edges of a back into the
various different bags and now we can do

00:41:30.289 --> 00:41:30.299
various different bags and now we can do
 

00:41:30.299 --> 00:41:33.229
various different bags and now we can do
the same thing that we did before so

00:41:33.229 --> 00:41:33.239
the same thing that we did before so
 

00:41:33.239 --> 00:41:34.729
the same thing that we did before so
let's up at the bottom one we can go

00:41:34.729 --> 00:41:34.739
let's up at the bottom one we can go
 

00:41:34.739 --> 00:41:36.259
let's up at the bottom one we can go
from summer to winter or winter to

00:41:36.259 --> 00:41:36.269
from summer to winter or winter to
 

00:41:36.269 --> 00:41:39.620
from summer to winter or winter to
summer except now because it's seen lots

00:41:39.620 --> 00:41:39.630
summer except now because it's seen lots
 

00:41:39.630 --> 00:41:41.239
summer except now because it's seen lots
of examples already seen some examples

00:41:41.239 --> 00:41:41.249
of examples already seen some examples
 

00:41:41.249 --> 00:41:42.799
of examples already seen some examples
where it's more snow and less snow some

00:41:42.799 --> 00:41:42.809
where it's more snow and less snow some
 

00:41:42.809 --> 00:41:44.150
where it's more snow and less snow some
examples where there might be more Leafs

00:41:44.150 --> 00:41:44.160
examples where there might be more Leafs
 

00:41:44.160 --> 00:41:46.039
examples where there might be more Leafs
and less leaves it actually learned to

00:41:46.039 --> 00:41:46.049
and less leaves it actually learned to
 

00:41:46.049 --> 00:41:48.109
and less leaves it actually learned to
use these different styles so now I can

00:41:48.109 --> 00:41:48.119
use these different styles so now I can
 

00:41:48.119 --> 00:41:50.180
use these different styles so now I can
go from winter to summer but also maybe

00:41:50.180 --> 00:41:50.190
go from winter to summer but also maybe
 

00:41:50.190 --> 00:41:52.430
go from winter to summer but also maybe
to a bit more spring where this you know

00:41:52.430 --> 00:41:52.440
to a bit more spring where this you know
 

00:41:52.440 --> 00:41:54.319
to a bit more spring where this you know
fewer Leafs and they can go from summer

00:41:54.319 --> 00:41:54.329
fewer Leafs and they can go from summer
 

00:41:54.329 --> 00:41:56.329
fewer Leafs and they can go from summer
to winter but with more or less know

00:41:56.329 --> 00:41:56.339
to winter but with more or less know
 

00:41:56.339 --> 00:41:59.269
to winter but with more or less know
what it's learned that the mapping then

00:41:59.269 --> 00:41:59.279
what it's learned that the mapping then
 

00:41:59.279 --> 00:42:02.180
what it's learned that the mapping then
we also did from cityscapes which just

00:42:02.180 --> 00:42:02.190
we also did from cityscapes which just
 

00:42:02.190 --> 00:42:04.989
we also did from cityscapes which just
realistic private leaders to this

00:42:04.989 --> 00:42:04.999
realistic private leaders to this
 

00:42:04.999 --> 00:42:08.390
realistic private leaders to this
synthetic images of driving and it's

00:42:08.390 --> 00:42:08.400
synthetic images of driving and it's
 

00:42:08.400 --> 00:42:10.039
synthetic images of driving and it's
learned that there's things like I think

00:42:10.039 --> 00:42:10.049
learned that there's things like I think
 

00:42:10.049 --> 00:42:12.289
learned that there's things like I think
this is rain there's snow and there's

00:42:12.289 --> 00:42:12.299
this is rain there's snow and there's
 

00:42:12.299 --> 00:42:15.829
this is rain there's snow and there's
near dusk and the same thing here we go

00:42:15.829 --> 00:42:15.839
near dusk and the same thing here we go
 

00:42:15.839 --> 00:42:20.259
near dusk and the same thing here we go
from a synthetic to realistic images of

00:42:20.259 --> 00:42:20.269
from a synthetic to realistic images of
 

00:42:20.269 --> 00:42:23.019
from a synthetic to realistic images of
silly scenes and it's learn today's surf

00:42:23.019 --> 00:42:23.029
silly scenes and it's learn today's surf
 

00:42:23.029 --> 00:42:24.709
silly scenes and it's learn today's surf
cobblestone again and different

00:42:24.709 --> 00:42:24.719
cobblestone again and different
 

00:42:24.719 --> 00:42:28.759
cobblestone again and different
pavements and for different looks and we

00:42:28.759 --> 00:42:28.769
pavements and for different looks and we
 

00:42:28.769 --> 00:42:31.390
pavements and for different looks and we
can do the same thing for ya

00:42:31.390 --> 00:42:31.400
can do the same thing for ya
 

00:42:31.400 --> 00:42:33.799
can do the same thing for ya
applying surf photographic style in a

00:42:33.799 --> 00:42:33.809
applying surf photographic style in a
 

00:42:33.809 --> 00:42:38.089
applying surf photographic style in a
way so here we've given it lots of

00:42:38.089 --> 00:42:38.099
way so here we've given it lots of
 

00:42:38.099 --> 00:42:40.219
way so here we've given it lots of
images of summer and winter images of

00:42:40.219 --> 00:42:40.229
images of summer and winter images of
 

00:42:40.229 --> 00:42:43.249
images of summer and winter images of
you know your somebody but some of them

00:42:43.249 --> 00:42:43.259
you know your somebody but some of them
 

00:42:43.259 --> 00:42:44.689
you know your somebody but some of them
were taking at night some of them we're

00:42:44.689 --> 00:42:44.699
were taking at night some of them we're
 

00:42:44.699 --> 00:42:46.849
were taking at night some of them we're
taking at dawn some of them are taking

00:42:46.849 --> 00:42:46.859
taking at dawn some of them are taking
 

00:42:46.859 --> 00:42:49.700
taking at dawn some of them are taking
yeah yeah when it was nice out some

00:42:49.700 --> 00:42:49.710
yeah yeah when it was nice out some
 

00:42:49.710 --> 00:42:51.140
yeah yeah when it was nice out some
so I'm wearin so it learns different

00:42:51.140 --> 00:42:51.150
so I'm wearin so it learns different
 

00:42:51.150 --> 00:42:52.490
so I'm wearin so it learns different
styles so when you go from summer to

00:42:52.490 --> 00:42:52.500
styles so when you go from summer to
 

00:42:52.500 --> 00:42:54.530
styles so when you go from summer to
winter yes they all have some a little

00:42:54.530 --> 00:42:54.540
winter yes they all have some a little
 

00:42:54.540 --> 00:42:56.180
winter yes they all have some a little
bit of snow but some of them are you

00:42:56.180 --> 00:42:56.190
bit of snow but some of them are you
 

00:42:56.190 --> 00:42:57.440
bit of snow but some of them are you
know during a bright day some of them

00:42:57.440 --> 00:42:57.450
know during a bright day some of them
 

00:42:57.450 --> 00:43:00.530
know during a bright day some of them
are sunset and so forth the same when

00:43:00.530 --> 00:43:00.540
are sunset and so forth the same when
 

00:43:00.540 --> 00:43:02.810
are sunset and so forth the same when
you go from winter to summer somewhere

00:43:02.810 --> 00:43:02.820
you go from winter to summer somewhere
 

00:43:02.820 --> 00:43:04.280
you go from winter to summer somewhere
taking at night some we're taking during

00:43:04.280 --> 00:43:04.290
taking at night some we're taking during
 

00:43:04.290 --> 00:43:05.960
taking at night some we're taking during
the day and it's learned today Steve

00:43:05.960 --> 00:43:05.970
the day and it's learned today Steve
 

00:43:05.970 --> 00:43:09.560
the day and it's learned today Steve
different styles now the different

00:43:09.560 --> 00:43:09.570
different styles now the different
 

00:43:09.570 --> 00:43:11.660
different styles now the different
styles they're not disentangle meaning I

00:43:11.660 --> 00:43:11.670
styles they're not disentangle meaning I
 

00:43:11.670 --> 00:43:13.990
styles they're not disentangle meaning I
can't tell you it should be sort of

00:43:13.990 --> 00:43:14.000
can't tell you it should be sort of
 

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:16.880
can't tell you it should be sort of
nighttime and more snow or because it

00:43:16.880 --> 00:43:16.890
nighttime and more snow or because it
 

00:43:16.890 --> 00:43:18.620
nighttime and more snow or because it
doesn't know about this so it's surf

00:43:18.620 --> 00:43:18.630
doesn't know about this so it's surf
 

00:43:18.630 --> 00:43:20.900
doesn't know about this so it's surf
one style which encodes all of the

00:43:20.900 --> 00:43:20.910
one style which encodes all of the
 

00:43:20.910 --> 00:43:23.089
one style which encodes all of the
different aspects of the image and you

00:43:23.089 --> 00:43:23.099
different aspects of the image and you
 

00:43:23.099 --> 00:43:25.130
different aspects of the image and you
can't actually just angle it there's the

00:43:25.130 --> 00:43:25.140
can't actually just angle it there's the
 

00:43:25.140 --> 00:43:26.720
can't actually just angle it there's the
other work who could apply but in this

00:43:26.720 --> 00:43:26.730
other work who could apply but in this
 

00:43:26.730 --> 00:43:30.970
other work who could apply but in this
case we didn't actually disentangle it

00:43:30.970 --> 00:43:30.980
 
 

00:43:30.980 --> 00:43:34.760
 
so now this is an example where we

00:43:34.760 --> 00:43:34.770
so now this is an example where we
 

00:43:34.770 --> 00:43:37.849
so now this is an example where we
translate from a dog video to a cat

00:43:37.849 --> 00:43:37.859
translate from a dog video to a cat
 

00:43:37.859 --> 00:43:40.400
translate from a dog video to a cat
video but since we have a style code we

00:43:40.400 --> 00:43:40.410
video but since we have a style code we
 

00:43:40.410 --> 00:43:43.720
video but since we have a style code we
can go through different types of cats

00:43:43.720 --> 00:43:43.730
can go through different types of cats
 

00:43:43.730 --> 00:43:46.839
can go through different types of cats
and then we can animate the dog again

00:43:46.839 --> 00:43:46.849
and then we can animate the dog again
 

00:43:46.849 --> 00:43:50.150
and then we can animate the dog again
and all its scene is really videos of or

00:43:50.150 --> 00:43:50.160
and all its scene is really videos of or
 

00:43:50.160 --> 00:43:54.070
and all its scene is really videos of or
images of dogs and images of cats and

00:43:54.070 --> 00:43:54.080
images of dogs and images of cats and
 

00:43:54.080 --> 00:43:58.280
images of dogs and images of cats and
it's learned how to translate them and

00:43:58.280 --> 00:43:58.290
it's learned how to translate them and
 

00:43:58.290 --> 00:44:00.620
it's learned how to translate them and
here we go house cat - big cat but we

00:44:00.620 --> 00:44:00.630
here we go house cat - big cat but we
 

00:44:00.630 --> 00:44:03.380
here we go house cat - big cat but we
interpolate in the latent space sorry we

00:44:03.380 --> 00:44:03.390
interpolate in the latent space sorry we
 

00:44:03.390 --> 00:44:06.109
interpolate in the latent space sorry we
interpolate the style code so it's the

00:44:06.109 --> 00:44:06.119
interpolate the style code so it's the
 

00:44:06.119 --> 00:44:08.240
interpolate the style code so it's the
same cat do you always see or the same

00:44:08.240 --> 00:44:08.250
same cat do you always see or the same
 

00:44:08.250 --> 00:44:10.550
same cat do you always see or the same
pose I should say but different types of

00:44:10.550 --> 00:44:10.560
pose I should say but different types of
 

00:44:10.560 --> 00:44:18.589
pose I should say but different types of
cats yeah go from cat dog I get it's

00:44:18.589 --> 00:44:18.599
cats yeah go from cat dog I get it's
 

00:44:18.599 --> 00:44:21.370
cats yeah go from cat dog I get it's
always the same pose but different

00:44:21.370 --> 00:44:21.380
always the same pose but different
 

00:44:21.380 --> 00:44:28.260
always the same pose but different
styles

00:44:28.260 --> 00:44:28.270
 
 

00:44:28.270 --> 00:44:29.880
 
it's interesting was actually even

00:44:29.880 --> 00:44:29.890
it's interesting was actually even
 

00:44:29.890 --> 00:44:32.010
it's interesting was actually even
learned that yeah some animals or some

00:44:32.010 --> 00:44:32.020
learned that yeah some animals or some
 

00:44:32.020 --> 00:44:34.020
learned that yeah some animals or some
styles have you know our furrier so

00:44:34.020 --> 00:44:34.030
styles have you know our furrier so
 

00:44:34.030 --> 00:44:35.880
styles have you know our furrier so
they're bigger and so it actually yeah

00:44:35.880 --> 00:44:35.890
they're bigger and so it actually yeah
 

00:44:35.890 --> 00:44:37.950
they're bigger and so it actually yeah
gross them a little bit to accommodate

00:44:37.950 --> 00:44:37.960
gross them a little bit to accommodate
 

00:44:37.960 --> 00:44:39.930
gross them a little bit to accommodate
the fur shrinks them again which is

00:44:39.930 --> 00:44:39.940
the fur shrinks them again which is
 

00:44:39.940 --> 00:44:42.660
the fur shrinks them again which is
which is quite interesting of course

00:44:42.660 --> 00:44:42.670
which is quite interesting of course
 

00:44:42.670 --> 00:44:44.700
which is quite interesting of course
once we have this we can also do it you

00:44:44.700 --> 00:44:44.710
once we have this we can also do it you
 

00:44:44.710 --> 00:44:46.050
once we have this we can also do it you
know what's called style transfer

00:44:46.050 --> 00:44:46.060
know what's called style transfer
 

00:44:46.060 --> 00:44:47.790
know what's called style transfer
meaning I want to apply a particular

00:44:47.790 --> 00:44:47.800
meaning I want to apply a particular
 

00:44:47.800 --> 00:44:50.280
meaning I want to apply a particular
style given an example image so similar

00:44:50.280 --> 00:44:50.290
style given an example image so similar
 

00:44:50.290 --> 00:44:52.650
style given an example image so similar
to the very first part of the talk so

00:44:52.650 --> 00:44:52.660
to the very first part of the talk so
 

00:44:52.660 --> 00:44:55.620
to the very first part of the talk so
here I have a tease potential shoes I

00:44:55.620 --> 00:44:55.630
here I have a tease potential shoes I
 

00:44:55.630 --> 00:44:57.060
here I have a tease potential shoes I
want to synthesize give them their edges

00:44:57.060 --> 00:44:57.070
want to synthesize give them their edges
 

00:44:57.070 --> 00:44:59.550
want to synthesize give them their edges
and now I can tell you I want this style

00:44:59.550 --> 00:44:59.560
and now I can tell you I want this style
 

00:44:59.560 --> 00:45:01.170
and now I can tell you I want this style
or this style or this style and then

00:45:01.170 --> 00:45:01.180
or this style or this style and then
 

00:45:01.180 --> 00:45:02.460
or this style or this style and then
kind of apply it to all kinds of

00:45:02.460 --> 00:45:02.470
kind of apply it to all kinds of
 

00:45:02.470 --> 00:45:04.440
kind of apply it to all kinds of
different shoes right so can have the

00:45:04.440 --> 00:45:04.450
different shoes right so can have the
 

00:45:04.450 --> 00:45:06.810
different shoes right so can have the
same style applied to different shoes

00:45:06.810 --> 00:45:06.820
same style applied to different shoes
 

00:45:06.820 --> 00:45:08.400
same style applied to different shoes
and the same thing can be done therefore

00:45:08.400 --> 00:45:08.410
and the same thing can be done therefore
 

00:45:08.410 --> 00:45:10.589
and the same thing can be done therefore
here we going from big cats to house

00:45:10.589 --> 00:45:10.599
here we going from big cats to house
 

00:45:10.599 --> 00:45:12.450
here we going from big cats to house
cats and they can tell you I want this

00:45:12.450 --> 00:45:12.460
cats and they can tell you I want this
 

00:45:12.460 --> 00:45:14.460
cats and they can tell you I want this
particular type of cat but in the pose

00:45:14.460 --> 00:45:14.470
particular type of cat but in the pose
 

00:45:14.470 --> 00:45:17.490
particular type of cat but in the pose
of the big cat that's on the left and

00:45:17.490 --> 00:45:17.500
of the big cat that's on the left and
 

00:45:17.500 --> 00:45:19.290
of the big cat that's on the left and
again this is an unsupervised fashion

00:45:19.290 --> 00:45:19.300
again this is an unsupervised fashion
 

00:45:19.300 --> 00:45:21.060
again this is an unsupervised fashion
but it learned what the correspondent

00:45:21.060 --> 00:45:21.070
but it learned what the correspondent
 

00:45:21.070 --> 00:45:22.980
but it learned what the correspondent
should be it learned that these poses

00:45:22.980 --> 00:45:22.990
should be it learned that these poses
 

00:45:22.990 --> 00:45:25.560
should be it learned that these poses
are similar without being told

00:45:25.560 --> 00:45:25.570
are similar without being told
 

00:45:25.570 --> 00:45:31.710
are similar without being told
explicitly right there's a comparison

00:45:31.710 --> 00:45:31.720
explicitly right there's a comparison
 

00:45:31.720 --> 00:45:35.370
explicitly right there's a comparison
between different methods in all

00:45:35.370 --> 00:45:35.380
between different methods in all
 

00:45:35.380 --> 00:45:36.890
between different methods in all
fairness not all of them are actually

00:45:36.890 --> 00:45:36.900
fairness not all of them are actually
 

00:45:36.900 --> 00:45:39.650
fairness not all of them are actually
geared towards this particular use case

00:45:39.650 --> 00:45:39.660
geared towards this particular use case
 

00:45:39.660 --> 00:45:42.420
geared towards this particular use case
so yeah ours worked fairly well which is

00:45:42.420 --> 00:45:42.430
so yeah ours worked fairly well which is
 

00:45:42.430 --> 00:45:43.829
so yeah ours worked fairly well which is
not surprising we made it

00:45:43.829 --> 00:45:43.839
not surprising we made it
 

00:45:43.839 --> 00:45:45.510
not surprising we made it
yeah such that it would work well in

00:45:45.510 --> 00:45:45.520
yeah such that it would work well in
 

00:45:45.520 --> 00:45:47.070
yeah such that it would work well in
this case where some of the sort of more

00:45:47.070 --> 00:45:47.080
this case where some of the sort of more
 

00:45:47.080 --> 00:45:49.140
this case where some of the sort of more
traditional neural our style transferred

00:45:49.140 --> 00:45:49.150
traditional neural our style transferred
 

00:45:49.150 --> 00:45:51.540
traditional neural our style transferred
they're not quite meant for it this is

00:45:51.540 --> 00:45:51.550
they're not quite meant for it this is
 

00:45:51.550 --> 00:45:53.599
they're not quite meant for it this is
actually the first work that I showed

00:45:53.599 --> 00:45:53.609
actually the first work that I showed
 

00:45:53.609 --> 00:45:56.599
actually the first work that I showed
yeah it's not really meant for this case

00:45:56.599 --> 00:45:56.609
yeah it's not really meant for this case
 

00:45:56.609 --> 00:45:58.620
yeah it's not really meant for this case
it doesn't work as well because these

00:45:58.620 --> 00:45:58.630
it doesn't work as well because these
 

00:45:58.630 --> 00:46:00.630
it doesn't work as well because these
are meant for sort of just applying

00:46:00.630 --> 00:46:00.640
are meant for sort of just applying
 

00:46:00.640 --> 00:46:03.120
are meant for sort of just applying
style but not changing yet a particular

00:46:03.120 --> 00:46:03.130
style but not changing yet a particular
 

00:46:03.130 --> 00:46:06.180
style but not changing yet a particular
animal as we did in this case in this

00:46:06.180 --> 00:46:06.190
animal as we did in this case in this
 

00:46:06.190 --> 00:46:12.510
animal as we did in this case in this
case right okay so this concludes my

00:46:12.510 --> 00:46:12.520
case right okay so this concludes my
 

00:46:12.520 --> 00:46:15.210
case right okay so this concludes my
talk so I've presented a lot of methods

00:46:15.210 --> 00:46:15.220
talk so I've presented a lot of methods
 

00:46:15.220 --> 00:46:17.880
talk so I've presented a lot of methods
on translating one image to another

00:46:17.880 --> 00:46:17.890
on translating one image to another
 

00:46:17.890 --> 00:46:20.270
on translating one image to another
omits another image in various ways

00:46:20.270 --> 00:46:20.280
omits another image in various ways
 

00:46:20.280 --> 00:46:22.470
omits another image in various ways
supervised Unser Royce you know model

00:46:22.470 --> 00:46:22.480
supervised Unser Royce you know model
 

00:46:22.480 --> 00:46:26.339
supervised Unser Royce you know model
and multi modal and that's it

00:46:26.339 --> 00:46:26.349
and multi modal and that's it
 

00:46:26.349 --> 00:46:28.570
and multi modal and that's it
thank you

00:46:28.570 --> 00:46:28.580
thank you
