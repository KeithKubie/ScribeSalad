MARU AHUES: Hi.

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:11.320
Welcome to Google
Developers Live.

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:12.360
My name is Maru.

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.600
And with me today, I have
Youssef Attalla from Orbitz.

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.680
Today, we have a
very exciting show.

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:19.810
We're going to go over
the Orbitz integration

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:21.810
with the Wallet Objects API.

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.980
This is the second show we're
doing to showcase the Orbitz

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:27.830
integration with Google Wallet.

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:30.110
The Wallet Object's API
is a simple platform

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:32.960
that allows developers
to build digital versions

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.850
of physical cards that can
be stored in Google Wallet,

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.840
such as loyalty cards, boarding
passes, offers, and more.

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.320
It also allows you to
engage your customers

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.310
through real time updates,
location-based notifications,

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:47.290
and messaging.

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:49.020
If you watched last
week's GDL, you

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.900
see how Orbitz integrated
with the Instant Buy API

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:53.340
to speed up checkout.

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:54.980
If you haven't
watched that video,

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:57.170
go ahead and watch
it after this one.

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:59.070
Today, Youssef is
going to walk us

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.710
through their integration
with the Wallet Objects API

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.580
and go over some
integration questions

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:06.300
and do a demo of how
it works with India.

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:06.800
Hi, Youssef.

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:07.450
How are you?

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:08.569
Thanks for joining us.

00:01:08.569 --> 00:01:09.610
YOUSSEF ATTALLA: Hi Maru.

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:10.959
Thanks for having me.

00:01:10.959 --> 00:01:12.750
MARU AHUES: We're so
glad to have you here.

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.040
Why don't we go over some
questions first, and then

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:19.400
let's do a demo of how the
account sign-up and the linking

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:22.456
works from within our app?

00:01:22.456 --> 00:01:24.140
Why don't you tell
us a little bit

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:28.600
of why did Orbitz decide to
integrate the Orbitz Rewards

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.704
Program into Google Wallet?

00:01:31.704 --> 00:01:32.620
YOUSSEF ATTALLA: Sure.

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:36.010
The idea was to reach the large
user base of the Google Wallet

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:39.970
app in order to drive awareness
of the Orbitz Awards Loyalty

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:42.760
Program that we just
launched last October.

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:46.315
And this has also increased
memberships on our website.

00:01:46.315 --> 00:01:48.940
MARU AHUES: So now that you guys
are done with the integration,

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:52.420
how easy or difficult was it
to integrate with the Wallet

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:54.040
Objects API?

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:55.960
YOUSSEF ATTALLA:
Oh, great question.

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:58.440
So, you know, working
with the new API

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.070
always comes with its
own set of challenges.

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:04.130
But it also comes with a
great learning experience.

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:06.210
So while some parts
of the documentation

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.720
were very well described and the
steps were very easy to follow,

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.050
some other parts
were evolving as we

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:13.820
are working on that feature.

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:16.850
I do have to mention, though,
that we did get a great support

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:19.320
from our Google
contact, aka Maru.

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:20.480
Thanks for that.

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.830
And that definitely helped
speeding up the process

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:25.120
and make it as
smooth as possible.

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.730
MARU AHUES: It was also
fun working with you guys.

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:31.070
So if I book a hotel
on Orbitz, when

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:33.950
do I get my Orbucks
updated in the app?

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:37.250
Do I get them update the
same day or the next day?

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:40.614
Can you tell us a little bit
about that process on updates?

00:02:40.614 --> 00:02:41.530
YOUSSEF ATTALLA: Yeah.

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:45.690
So as of now, it takes 24
hours for the Orbucks balance

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:47.010
to be updated.

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.750
And the way we do that is
that we run a daily job that

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.190
checks the status of
our loyalty members

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:56.720
who registered or linked
through the Google Wallet app.

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:00.610
And we get the most recent
version of the loyalty object,

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:03.190
compare that to
our local database.

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:05.510
If there's any differences
in their Orbucks

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:07.850
balance or their
status, then we have

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:11.210
to push a change to this
object through the API

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:13.280
calls in the documentation.

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.450
This way, next time
the user open the app,

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:17.807
they will see their
updated balance.

00:03:17.807 --> 00:03:19.640
MARU AHUES: So let's
take a look at the demo

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:24.144
and how I can book a hotel on
Orbitz and earn some Orbucks.

00:03:24.144 --> 00:03:25.060
YOUSSEF ATTALLA: Sure.

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:27.270
Let me show you how.

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:28.740
So here we go.

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:31.550
We go to the Hotels path.

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:33.140
Let's look for a city.

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:36.040
Let's say, Las Vegas.

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:37.830
Somewhere warmer than
here because it's

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:40.220
pretty cold in Chicago now.

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:43.460
And just pick a dates.

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:47.181
Some time in April.

00:03:47.181 --> 00:03:47.870
And search.

00:03:53.638 --> 00:03:54.140
All right.

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:56.160
So now, I get a list of hotels.

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:59.380
Looks like there's some deals.

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:02.620
Let's look for a good one.

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:06.160
And yeah, that seems
like a good deal.

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:08.192
Fits my budget.

00:04:08.192 --> 00:04:11.575
Let's check the pictures.

00:04:11.575 --> 00:04:13.250
All right.

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:14.010
Looks good to me.

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:15.640
Convinced.

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:21.200
So select a room like that one.

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:28.040
And now we can see the summary.

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:31.250
I see the mobiles
deal is applied.

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:32.350
And see this form?

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:34.930
I don't want to really
fill all this information.

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:38.820
So now that we integrated
the Google+ sign-in,

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:43.920
so what I can do is I can click
Sign In for faster booking.

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:46.200
Google+.

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:47.240
Pick a Google account.

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:51.546
And boom, now I'm signed
into Orbitz through Google+.

00:04:51.546 --> 00:04:53.520
And since I'm a
loyalty member, you

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:58.240
can see here that I can
earn $1.89 in Orbucks

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:00.400
if I made this booking.

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:02.900
And also, because I'm
signed in through Google+,

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:05.110
if I clicked on Buy
with Google Wallet,

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:07.830
I'll find the credit
card [INAUDIBLE].

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:10.250
I don't need to add
any more information.

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:11.195
I just click Continue.

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:16.954
Display the credit card.

00:05:16.954 --> 00:05:17.870
Check the information.

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:21.170
Confirm everything is right.

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:22.810
And book.

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:28.700
Now, if everything
went fine, we'll

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:33.460
see the confirmation screen
with the record locator

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:35.970
for this booking
and also tell you

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:37.871
how many Orbucks you
earned on this booking.

00:05:37.871 --> 00:05:38.370
Boom.

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:39.460
That's how easy it is.

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:41.660
MARU AHUES: Wow, that was
pretty easy and quick.

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:45.240
I really like the new Google+
integration that you guys did.

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:47.380
So now that I
earned some Orbucks,

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:50.350
let's take a look at how we
can link our existing Orbitz

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:52.610
Rewards account
into Google Wallet

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:55.280
and then take a look at my
points that we just earned.

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:57.460
YOUSSEF ATTALLA:
Sure, let me show you.

00:05:57.460 --> 00:05:59.990
So here we have the
Google Wallet app.

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:05.020
Then I go to Loyalty
Programs, Add a Program,

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:06.805
and look for Orbitz.

00:06:11.311 --> 00:06:13.950
Here you go.

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:17.980
And see here, that's the
Orbitz reward description.

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:22.850
I'll get up to 5% on hotels
on our mobile apps, plus 1%.

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:24.470
And since I'm
already a member, I'm

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:27.920
going to click on a
member with my email.

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:30.730
That's the same email that
I used to sign in on Orbitz.

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:42.687
All right.

00:06:42.687 --> 00:06:43.520
[INAUDIBLE] program.

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:47.530
Now there's a verify first and
last name and my phone number.

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:53.780
Click on Verify.

00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:56.950
And here you go.

00:06:56.950 --> 00:06:58.720
So now we see the Orbucks.

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:00.360
And if you click
on this card, you

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:04.690
get the loyalty object that
we talked about earlier.

00:07:04.690 --> 00:07:06.470
And you see the updated balance.

00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:07.220
MARU AHUES: Great.

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:08.345
YOUSSEF ATTALLA: That's it.

00:07:08.345 --> 00:07:10.350
MARU AHUES: It can't get
any easier than that.

00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:15.260
So you open the app and you look
for the program Orbitz Rewards.

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:18.090
Then you just enter
the same email address

00:07:18.090 --> 00:07:21.300
that we used to create our
Orbitz Rewards account online.

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:24.045
And then you can check
your points, right?

00:07:24.045 --> 00:07:24.920
YOUSSEF ATTALLA: Yep.

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:26.628
MARU AHUES: So the
Google Wallet app also

00:07:26.628 --> 00:07:29.800
allows users to sign up for
a new loyalty program in case

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:33.230
they haven't signed up
already or of course

00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:34.880
link to an existing
account the way

00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:36.600
that you just saw in the demo.

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:38.580
Google will post
[INAUDIBLE] request

00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:40.850
with the user-provided
information

00:07:40.850 --> 00:07:43.032
to the merchant's
web service URL.

00:07:43.032 --> 00:07:44.490
And then the
merchant's web service

00:07:44.490 --> 00:07:47.480
needs to respond back to
Google with either a success

00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:48.810
or failure.

00:07:48.810 --> 00:07:51.060
And in the case of
a success, then you

00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:52.710
need to send back
the loyalty object

00:07:52.710 --> 00:07:55.560
that will save on that
user, which is in this case

00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:57.400
a loyalty card.

00:07:57.400 --> 00:07:59.860
Youssef, thanks so
much for joining us.

00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:00.934
It was great to have you.

00:08:00.934 --> 00:08:02.600
YOUSSEF ATTALLA:
Thanks for inviting me.

00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:05.442
I really learned a lot from
working under this project.

00:08:05.442 --> 00:08:07.790
MARU AHUES: And be sure to
check out the Orbitz Loyalty

00:08:07.790 --> 00:08:10.300
Program, Orbitz Rewards,
and Google Wallet.

00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:12.810
And join now to start
earning some Orbucks

00:08:12.810 --> 00:08:14.890
or link your existing
account if you already

00:08:14.890 --> 00:08:17.910
have one to keep track
of your Orbucks as well.

00:08:17.910 --> 00:08:20.300

And thanks for joining us
for another week of Google

00:08:31.430 --> 00:08:32.549
Developers Live.

00:08:32.549 --> 00:08:34.650
See you next time.
