00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:01.799
- [Sal] Let's do some practice examples

00:00:01.799 --> 00:00:05.549
from our intro to slope
y intercept exercise.

00:00:06.422 --> 00:00:08.956
What is the slope of y is equal to

00:00:08.956 --> 00:00:12.055
negative four x minus three?

00:00:12.055 --> 00:00:13.462
So you might already recognize,

00:00:13.462 --> 00:00:15.747
this is in slope intercept form.

00:00:15.747 --> 00:00:17.842
Just as a reminder,
slope intercept form is

00:00:17.842 --> 00:00:18.925
y is equal to

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:20.743
mx plus b,

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:25.795
where the coefficient on
this x term right over here,

00:00:25.795 --> 00:00:27.295
that is our slope,

00:00:28.518 --> 00:00:30.362
and then this constant right over here,

00:00:30.362 --> 00:00:34.119
that is going to give
you your y intercept.

00:00:34.119 --> 00:00:36.038
So if they're saying,
what is the slope here?

00:00:36.038 --> 00:00:36.996
Well I just need to figure out,

00:00:36.996 --> 00:00:39.844
what is the coefficient on this x term?

00:00:39.844 --> 00:00:41.703
And you can see that the coefficient here

00:00:41.703 --> 00:00:43.286
is a negative four.

00:00:44.441 --> 00:00:47.054
So that is going to be our m,

00:00:47.054 --> 00:00:49.147
that is going to be our slope.

00:00:49.147 --> 00:00:50.711
Now just as a reminder,
you have to make sure

00:00:50.711 --> 00:00:52.550
that it's solved in this way,

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:54.345
that is is solved for y,

00:00:54.345 --> 00:00:58.262
y is equal to something
times x minus three,

00:00:59.535 --> 00:01:01.129
so that's our slope.

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:03.629
Let's do another one of these.

00:01:05.029 --> 00:01:07.919
So we're asked, what is the y intercept

00:01:07.919 --> 00:01:11.965
of y is equal to negative
three x minus two?

00:01:11.965 --> 00:01:15.684
So once again we already have
it in slope intercept form.

00:01:15.684 --> 00:01:17.562
It's already been solved for y.

00:01:17.562 --> 00:01:20.979
It's of the form y is equal to mx plus b,

00:01:22.037 --> 00:01:26.050
where m, our slope, is
given right over here,

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:27.207
negative three.

00:01:27.207 --> 00:01:28.787
But they're not asking for our slope,

00:01:28.787 --> 00:01:31.443
they're asking for the y intercept.

00:01:31.443 --> 00:01:33.710
Well the y intercept is given by b here,

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:35.460
so b is negative two.

00:01:36.645 --> 00:01:39.484
Pay close attention to the sign here.

00:01:39.484 --> 00:01:41.780
So b is equal to negative two.

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:43.201
But when I look at these choices,

00:01:43.201 --> 00:01:45.132
I don't see a b is equal to negative two,

00:01:45.132 --> 00:01:47.054
so what are they talking about?

00:01:47.054 --> 00:01:48.547
Well a y intercept is,

00:01:48.547 --> 00:01:51.497
what is the y value
when x is equal to zero?

00:01:51.497 --> 00:01:52.751
And you could see that here,

00:01:52.751 --> 00:01:55.082
if x was equal to zero
then that term goes away

00:01:55.082 --> 00:01:56.723
and y is equal to b.

00:01:56.723 --> 00:01:59.191
So if you want to know the point where

00:01:59.191 --> 00:02:01.391
the graph described by this equation

00:02:01.391 --> 00:02:03.498
intercepts the y axis,

00:02:03.498 --> 00:02:08.297
well it's going to be what
is y when x is equal to zero?

00:02:08.297 --> 00:02:12.422
Well when x is equal to zero,
y is equal to negative two.

00:02:12.422 --> 00:02:15.031
And you could see that in
our original equation, again.

00:02:15.031 --> 00:02:17.097
If x were zero, this term would go away,

00:02:17.097 --> 00:02:19.562
and y would be equal to negative two.

00:02:19.562 --> 00:02:22.286
So zero, comma, negative two.

00:02:22.286 --> 00:02:24.335
So it would be that
choice right over there.

00:02:24.335 --> 00:02:26.132
On Khan Academy obviously you
just have to click on that,

00:02:26.132 --> 00:02:27.987
you don't have to shade it in.

00:02:27.987 --> 00:02:29.487
Let's do one more.

00:02:32.062 --> 00:02:35.776
Complete the equation of the
line whose slope is five,

00:02:35.776 --> 00:02:38.859
and y intercept is zero, comma, four.

00:02:39.946 --> 00:02:41.946
So once again the general form is

00:02:41.946 --> 00:02:44.613
y is equal to our slope times x,

00:02:47.065 --> 00:02:48.894
if I want to put it in
slope intercept form,

00:02:48.894 --> 00:02:50.644
plus our y intercept.

00:02:52.233 --> 00:02:55.573
Well they're telling
us, our slope is five.

00:02:55.573 --> 00:02:58.049
Whose slope is five.

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:00.783
So we know that m is going to be five.

00:03:00.783 --> 00:03:05.198
And they tell us that the
y intercept is zero, four.

00:03:05.198 --> 00:03:08.387
So the y intercept, b,
that is the value of y

00:03:08.387 --> 00:03:10.218
when x is equal to zero.

00:03:10.218 --> 00:03:12.453
So the value of y when x equals zero

00:03:12.453 --> 00:03:14.375
is this four right over here.

00:03:14.375 --> 00:03:16.033
So that is going to be four.

00:03:16.033 --> 00:03:19.033
So I could say y is equal to

00:03:19.033 --> 00:03:21.200
five times x plus four.

00:03:25.619 --> 00:03:27.889
And when you're actually
entering it on Khan Academy,

00:03:27.889 --> 00:03:29.218
you would just type it in,

00:03:29.218 --> 00:03:30.325
or if you're using the app

00:03:30.325 --> 00:03:31.348
you would use it with your finger.

00:03:31.348 --> 00:03:33.370
And I always make the
mistake of writing y equals,

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:35.572
and I type in y equals five x plus four.

00:03:35.572 --> 00:03:38.074
Notice they already gave you
the y equals right over there.

00:03:38.074 --> 00:03:39.242
That's all you have to do,

00:03:39.242 --> 00:03:40.776
recognize the slope, the y intercept,

00:03:40.776 --> 00:03:44.905
and then remember what the slope
intercept form actually is.
