00:00:00.503 --> 00:00:02.128
- "Which of the following values

00:00:02.128 --> 00:00:03.986
"is equal to the value above?"

00:00:03.986 --> 00:00:05.948
And we got this expression here

00:00:05.948 --> 00:00:08.874
with a bunch of negative
fractional exponents.

00:00:08.874 --> 00:00:10.789
And at first you might say
how do I deal with this?

00:00:10.789 --> 00:00:14.132
Maybe I don't know what
the fifth root of three is,

00:00:14.132 --> 00:00:15.966
much less the negative fifth root,

00:00:15.966 --> 00:00:18.312
and this 1/3 to the negative 2/5,

00:00:18.312 --> 00:00:20.006
how do I simplify this?

00:00:20.006 --> 00:00:22.329
And the key realization here is that

00:00:22.329 --> 00:00:25.626
1/3 is the same thing as three
to the negative one power.

00:00:25.626 --> 00:00:29.250
1/3 is the same thing as three

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:30.968
to the negative one power.

00:00:30.968 --> 00:00:33.302
And we if do that I
suspect that we're going

00:00:33.302 --> 00:00:35.043
to be able to get similar bases here.

00:00:35.043 --> 00:00:36.332
Let me rewrite the whole thing.

00:00:36.332 --> 00:00:39.710
So it's gonna be three to the negative 1/5

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:41.544
times, instead of writing 1/3,

00:00:41.544 --> 00:00:44.446
I could write three to
the negative one power,

00:00:44.446 --> 00:00:47.128
to the negative 2/5 power

00:00:47.128 --> 00:00:49.044
and now we could just use up
our straight exponent rules

00:00:49.044 --> 00:00:51.261
to simplify things a little bit.

00:00:51.261 --> 00:00:53.025
So this business right over here

00:00:53.025 --> 00:00:54.941
that I'm squaring this orange color,

00:00:54.941 --> 00:00:56.485
if I raise something to an exponent

00:00:56.485 --> 00:00:58.667
and then raise it again
to another exponent

00:00:58.667 --> 00:00:59.747
that's going to be the same thing

00:00:59.747 --> 00:01:01.849
as taking our original raise

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:04.927
and raising it to the negative one times,

00:01:04.927 --> 00:01:09.628
the negative one times negative 2/5 power.

00:01:09.628 --> 00:01:11.322
So I can raise, if I raise
it to the negative one

00:01:11.322 --> 00:01:13.041
and then to the negative 2/5

00:01:13.041 --> 00:01:14.724
that's the same thing as raising three

00:01:14.724 --> 00:01:18.249
to the negative one
times negative 2/5 power.

00:01:18.249 --> 00:01:19.834
And so and this one over here is still

00:01:19.834 --> 00:01:23.769
going to be three to the negative 1/5.

00:01:23.769 --> 00:01:28.535
And so this is going to be
equal to three to the negative,

00:01:28.535 --> 00:01:33.482
three to the negative 1/5 times,

00:01:33.482 --> 00:01:35.847
now negative one times negative 2/5,

00:01:35.847 --> 00:01:37.448
that's gonna be positive 2/5,

00:01:37.448 --> 00:01:41.047
so times three to the 2/5,

00:01:41.047 --> 00:01:44.123
and now we have a situation
where we have the same base,

00:01:44.123 --> 00:01:47.362
we have the product of
three to the negative 1/5

00:01:47.362 --> 00:01:50.299
times three to the positive 2/5,

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:51.959
this is going to be equal to,

00:01:51.959 --> 00:01:53.561
we can take our base three,

00:01:53.561 --> 00:01:58.182
it's gonna be three to the negative 1/5

00:01:58.182 --> 00:02:02.187
plus 2/5 power, plus 2/5 power.

00:02:02.187 --> 00:02:03.207
If you have the same base,

00:02:03.207 --> 00:02:05.354
the product of that base
raised to one exponent

00:02:05.354 --> 00:02:07.188
and that same base raised
to another exponent

00:02:07.188 --> 00:02:09.069
that's the same thing as that base raised

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:10.996
to the sum of those exponents.

00:02:10.996 --> 00:02:12.552
A classic exponent property.

00:02:12.552 --> 00:02:13.818
I encourage you to go onto Khan Academy

00:02:13.818 --> 00:02:16.766
if this is looking foreign
or if you need some review.

00:02:16.766 --> 00:02:18.066
But now this is pretty straightforward.

00:02:18.066 --> 00:02:20.214
This is going to be equal to,

00:02:20.214 --> 00:02:23.882
this is going to be equal
to three to the negative 1/5

00:02:23.882 --> 00:02:26.396
plus 2/5 is just 1/5.

00:02:27.086 --> 00:02:31.644
And there you have it,
three to the 1/5 power.
