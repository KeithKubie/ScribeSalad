00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.080
Our lips decline in volume with increasing age, light damage, and a variety of genetic factors.

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:10.280
So with lip filler (or lip augmentation) procedures becoming increasingly common in the States.

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:11.140
Thanks, Kylie

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.580
Are there any problems with the rising trend?

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:15.920
What actually happens when you get lip fillers?

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:21.160
Lip fillers are typically made from hyaluronic acid which may be the safest option we have today as

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:26.640
hyaluronic acid is found naturally in our skin, regulating nutrients, hormones, and the movement of cells

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.340
It's unlikely that you'll have an allergic reaction to it upon injection. But how does it work?

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:35.960
Although this type of procedure varies depending on the person's facial structure and their own goals,

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:40.240
the most common procedure addresses a deflated vermilion, or drooping around the upper lips.

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:45.320
Upon injection, hyaluronic acid, which is a very polar sugar, physically fills the lips

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:49.920
but also attracts your body's natural stores of water and moisture to create a plumper look.

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.320
Doctors will most likely use injections to correct pre-existing asymmetry in your lips,

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:59.900
or to create a Cupid's bow, the dip in the central upper lip that's considered youthful or desirable.

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:01.320
Squeamish about needles?

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.420
Usually an anaesthetic similar to the one you get if the dentist can be applied before

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.040
or mixed in with the lip filler itself to reduce pain.

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.580
Post injection, the lip filler will be metabolised by the body between four and twelve months,

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:15.820
depending on the metabolism and physical activity of the person.

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:17.200
But are there any side effects?

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.740
Even with the best technique, there will be a lot of swelling and bruising at the sites of injection anywhere

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:23.800
from two days to two weeks.

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:28.340
Short term complications, like lumps, can be massaged in or treated with hyaluronidase,

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.660
an enzyme that will degrade the lip filler safely and rapidly.

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:35.800
This enzyme may also be injected in the lips if someone was unhappy with the results

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:38.160
allowing a complete reversal of the filler

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.600
Long-term, or late onset effects, like infections, chronic inflammation,

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.920
and allergic reactions have occurred as well.

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.520
However, these are extremely rare

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.920
They're usually associated with a non-licensed person performing the procedure

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.340
and can be treated easily with oral medication.

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.580
The only downside might be the $500 to $2000 dollar costs

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:57.000
which depends on the amount of injections you require.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.600
So if you're willing to put your money where your mouth is,

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.360
Lip augmentation could be a safe procedure and its risks can be minimized

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.200
when you work with a certified professional.

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.820
