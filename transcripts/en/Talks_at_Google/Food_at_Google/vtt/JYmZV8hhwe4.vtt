FEMALE SPEAKER: Good afternoon.

00:00:01.510 --> 00:00:04.788
It's my pleasure to welcome
Magnus Nilsson to Google.

00:00:06.625 --> 00:00:08.000
MAGNUS NILSSON:
I'm going to talk

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.810
a little bit about Nordic
food culture, in general.

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:13.260
And then I'm going to talk
a little bit about the book

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:18.210
that I've written about
it, "Nordic Cook Book."

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.660
Nordic food culture is
kind of interesting,

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.780
because it doesn't
really mean anything.

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:30.700
Because the Nordic Region, it's
simply a geographical area.

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:33.450
It's not a homogeneous cultural
region or anything like that.

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.730
So there's a lot of diversity
and a lot of variation

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:36.771
within the region itself.

00:00:36.771 --> 00:00:38.400
And it's quite
difficult to define.

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.437
And it's actually,
like, on these events,

00:00:40.437 --> 00:00:42.395
I try to do like a little
raise of hands, which

00:00:42.395 --> 00:00:45.250
is quite fascinating to
see, how people's knowledge

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:47.170
about the region itself is.

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:53.050
So how many in here
can say with certainty

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:55.889
what the difference is
between the Nordic Region

00:00:55.889 --> 00:00:56.555
and Scandinavia?

00:00:59.245 --> 00:01:00.680
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:04.430
So that was an unusually
poor result, zero.

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:06.514
It's usually about 10%,
I find, that at least

00:01:06.514 --> 00:01:07.680
think that they can do that.

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.770
So Scandinavia, which is
a cultural region as well

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.110
as a geographical region, it's
Sweden, Denmark, and Norway,

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:16.750
and nothing else.

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:20.370
And the Nordic Region, it's
Scandinavia plus Finland,

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:23.150
in the east, and then Aland,
in between Finland and Sweden

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:25.590
in the Baltic Sea,
the Faroe Islands,

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.280
between Iceland and
Scotland, and Iceland itself,

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.770
and Greenland.

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:33.230
So it's a much,
much bigger area.

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:35.530
And as you can imagine,
there's also, like,

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:38.700
a lot of diversity
within such a vast area.

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.480
So the natural circumstances
in the southeast of Finland

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:48.770
are quite different from what
you'll find west of Greenland.

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.710
And here you have
the whole region.

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:54.945
And as I said before, one of
the things that really define it

00:01:54.945 --> 00:01:56.800
is the geographical vastness.

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:01.620
And one thing that is
another defining factor--

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:04.350
because I often get a question
about, like, pan-Nordic dishes.

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.850
And there are no such things
as a pan-Nordic dish, something

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:08.090
that exists everywhere.

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:10.470
But one thing that ties all
of these different countries

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.010
and regions together,
though, is the climate.

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:15.810
Because regardless where
you are in the region,

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:19.720
you're going to have four
distinctive seasons, of which

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.550
at least one of them is going
to be one where you can't really

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:25.055
harvest anything, in
terms of plant foods.

00:02:25.055 --> 00:02:27.680
You know, there's going to be a
real winter-- except for maybe,

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.719
like, a little piece of
the very south of Denmark.

00:02:30.719 --> 00:02:33.260
And this thing is something that
really ties the whole region

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.760
together-- the need to
produce an excess in summer,

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.747
and store it for winter,
and then consume it

00:02:39.747 --> 00:02:40.705
during the dark months.

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:49.880
And like, one really
good example of a dish

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:51.990
that's-- it's not
pan-Nordic, and I said--

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:54.140
but it's kind of as close
as you can get to that.

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.070
And that's really,
really defined

00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:01.520
by this thing with, you
know, having a proper winter,

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:04.530
is the open sandwich.

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:08.490
Basically a slice of
bread with a topping

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:12.380
and not putting that unnecessary
other slice of bread on top,

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:13.134
like you guys do.

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:17.520
And why is it so important?

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:20.650
And why is it found in
the whole region then?

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:24.600
And simply, because
grains, cereals,

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:28.990
they're one of the best ways
of collecting solar energy

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:31.927
in the summer and
then storing it

00:03:31.927 --> 00:03:33.510
through winter to
be consumed when you

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:34.718
don't have much solar energy.

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:42.520
And the thing is that, if
you look at a sandwich,

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:47.092
it says so much about where it's
being prepared and consumed,

00:03:47.092 --> 00:03:49.300
regardless of where you do
it in the world, you know.

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:52.300
And this obviously also
applies for the Nordic region.

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:54.970
And if we start at looking
at the bread-- obviously,

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:57.822
these days, you'll find,
like, crisp crusted baguettes

00:03:57.822 --> 00:03:59.780
and stuff like that all
over the Nordic Region,

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:01.160
as much as you'll find
them anywhere else.

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:03.076
But if you look at the
more traditional breads

00:04:03.076 --> 00:04:05.300
and why they make sense
where they are produced,

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:07.130
it is quite interesting.

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:13.610
And if we start with the loaf,
the loaf is a form of bread

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:16.200
that you kind of have to
eat relatively fresh, right?

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:19.220
It's best to eat in the same
day it's produced, or perhaps

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:22.700
within a couple of days
of the production date.

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:25.820
It means that you have
to bake loaves of bread

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:29.440
on a very regular basis for them
to have any chance in becoming

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:32.590
an everyday staple.

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:35.740
This in its turn, it
means that loaves of bread

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:37.810
as an everyday staple,
it can pretty much only

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:39.110
exist where you have bakeries.

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:41.980
Because no one is going
to bake their own bread

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:43.910
on an everyday basis.

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:46.460
And bakeries, they need
customers to sustain them.

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:48.360
So if you look at
the Nordic Region,

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:53.700
you have basically an area
from Stockholm and then south

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:57.380
over Denmark, which is
densely populated enough

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:59.710
in a sort of longer
perspective historically

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:02.670
so that you can
actually have bakeries.

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:06.609
And the loaf of bread-- at least
if it's baked outside of tin,

00:05:06.609 --> 00:05:08.150
if it's baked like
in a free-form way

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:10.600
in a traditional
oven-- it's also

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:13.607
something that needs
wheat to really function.

00:05:13.607 --> 00:05:16.190
Because you need a lot of gluten
to shape the loaf and to make

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:17.182
it rise.

00:05:17.182 --> 00:05:19.140
And wheat, it doesn't
really grow further north

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:20.820
than Stockholm either.

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:24.630
So these defining
factors means that slices

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:26.280
from a loaf of
bread is really kind

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:28.860
of a city occurrence, in
historical perspective,

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:31.790
and something you will
find in the southern parts

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:35.240
of the central parts
of the Nordics.

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:43.570
And then, if you go on
and look, for example,

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:47.970
in the north of Sweden
where I come from,

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:49.670
very little wheat grows there.

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:53.530
And it's also
scarcely populated.

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:56.040
Yentlin, which is my region,
it's the size of Denmark.

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:57.780
It's a sixth of the
surface of Sweden,

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:01.770
and it has about, today,
about one inhabitant

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:04.140
per square kilometer.

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:05.580
So not many people.

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:08.740
And no real cities up
until, like, 100 years ago.

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:11.710
And here, obviously,
there were no bakeries.

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:15.350
And to use the grains that
stored the solar energy

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:18.560
in summer, people had to kind
of prepare them in some way.

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:21.040
And because they couldn't
buy a loaf from a baker,

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:23.280
they bake bread themselves.

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:27.330
And because it's so
labor-intensive and so

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:30.732
expensive to heat your
ordinary wood-fired oven,

00:06:30.732 --> 00:06:32.190
people couldn't do
that very often.

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:35.190
It was more like
perhaps an annual thing.

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:37.030
You did it once a year.

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:39.910
And each farm would have
their own big baking oven.

00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:44.340
And perhaps late November, early
December, something like that,

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:47.360
for Christmas, when all
of the barley-- that's

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:49.800
the most common grain up there--
was harvested, and dried,

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:53.170
and prepared, you started
firing up the wood-fired oven.

00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:55.710
It takes, like, a good
24 hours to get it up

00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:59.640
to about 800 degrees
of temperature.

00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:02.660
And the first thing you
did-- because the key

00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:06.412
there is to make as much as
possible of that, you know,

00:07:06.412 --> 00:07:08.620
the big effort of heating
the ovens-- the first thing

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:11.060
that people did was to
make very, very thin

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:12.740
and large flatbreads.

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:16.200
Like, we're talking about barley
dough rolled out to maybe two

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:17.905
millimeters of thickness.

00:07:17.905 --> 00:07:20.030
Cooks really quickly, and
then when you take it out

00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:21.770
of the oven, it also
dries really quickly.

00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:23.603
And you can easily stack
them and store them

00:07:23.603 --> 00:07:24.982
for a really long time.

00:07:24.982 --> 00:07:26.940
And the way people would
eat them was basically

00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:31.380
to simply break off a piece,
maybe put some butter on it

00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:33.320
and bread, and just
eat it like that--

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:35.255
or, even, like, crumble
it up and soak it

00:07:35.255 --> 00:07:38.320
in broths, or with some
culture milk, or, you know,

00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:41.600
different preparations.

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:46.750
When those first very thin flat
cakes, destined to be dried,

00:07:46.750 --> 00:07:49.660
were done cooking, the oven
had cooled down a little bit.

00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:54.220
And we proceed by doing
soft flatbreads, which is

00:07:54.220 --> 00:07:57.870
more of an annual luxury item.

00:07:57.870 --> 00:07:59.780
A bit thicker, it's
basically the same dough,

00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:01.660
maybe a little bit
of sugar in it,

00:08:01.660 --> 00:08:03.910
a little bit thicker so that
you can fold them and eat

00:08:03.910 --> 00:08:06.870
them fresh for a couple
days just after having

00:08:06.870 --> 00:08:09.320
baked the yearly bread.

00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:11.830
The third bread to be
baked was another thing

00:08:11.830 --> 00:08:14.150
that people used
to make to prolong

00:08:14.150 --> 00:08:17.760
the shelf life of another
ingredient, which was blood.

00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:19.370
Because this time
year, late autumn,

00:08:19.370 --> 00:08:23.760
is also when people historically
harvested the excess

00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:26.570
from their meat
production in summer.

00:08:26.570 --> 00:08:28.070
And blood is very perishable.

00:08:28.070 --> 00:08:29.630
It doesn't store well.

00:08:29.630 --> 00:08:32.390
And one way of storing it
is to simply substitute

00:08:32.390 --> 00:08:37.039
the water or milk as a
liquid in a dough with blood.

00:08:37.039 --> 00:08:41.299
Bake a loaf, and then
pretty much just dry it.

00:08:41.299 --> 00:08:44.290
And then when you want to eat
it later, like in March or June

00:08:44.290 --> 00:08:47.170
or something like that, is to
break off pieces and simmer

00:08:47.170 --> 00:08:49.070
them in broth.

00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:52.960
And the very last thing--
the one up to the right

00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:55.932
there is a blood
bread, by the way.

00:08:55.932 --> 00:08:57.640
And the very, very
last thing that people

00:08:57.640 --> 00:09:00.900
did was also loaves, but
not all in the same way as

00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:03.780
in the southern sort
of more urban areas,

00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:05.520
where the loaf is an
everyday ingredient

00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:07.470
and consists of
mainly flour, water,

00:09:07.470 --> 00:09:09.530
and a little bit of
salt. Up here they

00:09:09.530 --> 00:09:12.330
made loaves as a really
special treat, maybe

00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:13.870
like two or three of them.

00:09:13.870 --> 00:09:18.480
And as with special
treats, being human,

00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:21.010
we kind of want to make
them even more special.

00:09:21.010 --> 00:09:24.510
So we put everything in there
that's expensive and fancy.

00:09:24.510 --> 00:09:26.320
And in historical
times, obviously, that

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:29.520
was sugar, for
example, and spices.

00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:33.260
So the further north you go in
the Nordic Region, this sweeter

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:36.256
and more seasoned the
breads are going to be.

00:09:36.256 --> 00:09:37.630
And I remember,
like, growing up,

00:09:37.630 --> 00:09:40.470
my grandma's rye
loaf is basically

00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:44.130
like an egg-less
ginger sponge cake,

00:09:44.130 --> 00:09:49.657
very, very sweet, almost
like at dessert, very tasty.

00:09:49.657 --> 00:09:52.240
And obviously, like in the south
where it's an everyday thing,

00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:54.640
you don't do that at all.

00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:58.084
And you can follow this pattern
all through the Nordic Region

00:09:58.084 --> 00:09:59.750
and look at how people
bake their bread.

00:09:59.750 --> 00:10:01.490
You know, if you go
to Norway, you're

00:10:01.490 --> 00:10:06.530
going to have pretty much the
same tendencies as in Denmark

00:10:06.530 --> 00:10:10.250
and Sweden, with a difference
that Norway, with it's

00:10:10.250 --> 00:10:13.340
sort of exposed coastal
climate, have much less firewood

00:10:13.340 --> 00:10:14.270
available.

00:10:14.270 --> 00:10:17.890
So they figured out more
efficient ways of baking.

00:10:17.890 --> 00:10:19.380
So their flatbreads
are most often

00:10:19.380 --> 00:10:23.620
going to be baked on,
like, a piece of sheet iron

00:10:23.620 --> 00:10:26.060
or, like, a flat stone with
a little fire underneath it,

00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:30.010
instead of that huge,
big wood-fired oven.

00:10:30.010 --> 00:10:33.560
Same goes for the
semi-nomadic Sami population--

00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:35.310
the indigenous population
of Scandinavia--

00:10:35.310 --> 00:10:36.810
because they moved
around, naturally

00:10:36.810 --> 00:10:38.120
they didn't have any ovens.

00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:40.350
But they did take with
them their flat stones

00:10:40.350 --> 00:10:42.370
to produce their traditional
gahkku flatbread.

00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:49.160
Moving on to Iceland, a
country with even less trees

00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:52.570
than Norway.

00:10:52.570 --> 00:10:56.860
Ovens weren't really a thing
at all until the invention

00:10:56.860 --> 00:10:58.500
and popularization
of the cast iron

00:10:58.500 --> 00:11:01.690
stove, which on Iceland was
most often fired with peat.

00:11:01.690 --> 00:11:04.740
And this is, like,
late-20th century.

00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:06.980
And everyone who has
seen a cast iron stove

00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:08.960
knows that the oven
is not very big.

00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:12.449
You can't really do much in
there, maybe one loaf of bread.

00:11:12.449 --> 00:11:13.990
What they do have
on Iceland, though,

00:11:13.990 --> 00:11:16.940
are these sort of thermally
active and volcanic areas.

00:11:16.940 --> 00:11:21.020
And quite often, next
to a village on Iceland,

00:11:21.020 --> 00:11:23.030
you'll see something
like this, which is

00:11:23.030 --> 00:11:24.570
basically next to a hot spring.

00:11:24.570 --> 00:11:26.960
And people have dug little
holes in the ground.

00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:29.462
Each family, each house,
will have their own hole,

00:11:29.462 --> 00:11:30.920
and you'll have a
lid on top of it.

00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:32.980
And the idea is
that, in the evening,

00:11:32.980 --> 00:11:36.550
you'll go there with your
rye bread dough in a bucket,

00:11:36.550 --> 00:11:39.140
put it down into the hole, put
the lid on, and then come back

00:11:39.140 --> 00:11:39.660
in the morning.

00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:41.750
And you're going to have
a steamed and cooked loaf

00:11:41.750 --> 00:11:42.649
of bread.

00:11:42.649 --> 00:11:44.565
And as far as I know,
this is the only example

00:11:44.565 --> 00:11:47.630
of steamed bread
historically found in Europe.

00:11:49.790 --> 00:11:52.290
And now we've gone through sort
of the base of the sandwich,

00:11:52.290 --> 00:11:53.624
like the bread part of it.

00:11:53.624 --> 00:11:55.790
And then we can start looking
at the toppings, which

00:11:55.790 --> 00:11:58.760
is another factor that says
a lot about where they're

00:11:58.760 --> 00:11:59.530
consumed.

00:11:59.530 --> 00:12:02.050
And it says a lot about
the culture of that place.

00:12:02.050 --> 00:12:04.020
This image here is
from a restaurant

00:12:04.020 --> 00:12:06.130
in Copenhagen
called Schonnemann,

00:12:06.130 --> 00:12:09.250
which is one of the most
traditional open-faced sandwich

00:12:09.250 --> 00:12:10.660
restaurants.

00:12:10.660 --> 00:12:13.320
And Denmark, you know,
with its position

00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:16.660
as the land connection between
the Nordics and central Europe,

00:12:16.660 --> 00:12:20.330
naturally being quite
a rich trading country,

00:12:20.330 --> 00:12:23.660
happens also to be very rich
in terms of agriculture.

00:12:23.660 --> 00:12:25.590
And you can really see
this on the sandwiches.

00:12:25.590 --> 00:12:26.880
Look about that, you know?

00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:28.010
There's no way
you're going to be

00:12:28.010 --> 00:12:30.343
able to pick that up without
it all, like, falling apart

00:12:30.343 --> 00:12:32.160
because there's just
so much toppings.

00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:35.860
So you eat them sitting down on
the plate with knife and fork.

00:12:35.860 --> 00:12:39.170
You often have them for,
like, a kind of nicer lunch.

00:12:39.170 --> 00:12:41.447
You'll have beer and
you'll have Aquavit.

00:12:41.447 --> 00:12:43.530
This says a lot about the
richness of the country.

00:12:46.510 --> 00:12:48.611
If you were to go up to
where I grew up, like,

00:12:48.611 --> 00:12:50.110
the sandwich would
be more like what

00:12:50.110 --> 00:12:51.930
I said before, a piece
of crisp flatbread

00:12:51.930 --> 00:12:54.190
with a simple layer of butter
and some cheese on it--

00:12:54.190 --> 00:12:56.606
something you would probably
eat standing up after working

00:12:56.606 --> 00:12:58.180
in the fields, for example.

00:12:58.180 --> 00:13:01.560
Same goes for the Sami breads.

00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:04.150
They would have
their Gahkku cakes

00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:06.740
with them during the workday
out herding the reindeer,

00:13:06.740 --> 00:13:09.650
simply eating them as
is with perhaps a piece

00:13:09.650 --> 00:13:10.900
of dried reindeer on the side.

00:13:13.540 --> 00:13:18.160
On the Faroe Islands, which
is a self-governed part

00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:21.700
of Denmark, self-governed
territory belonging to Denmark.

00:13:21.700 --> 00:13:24.400
They're clearly influenced
by the Danes and their bread

00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:24.900
culture.

00:13:24.900 --> 00:13:29.220
So you definitely find like
rye loaves and rye breads.

00:13:29.220 --> 00:13:31.140
But the toppings
are quite different,

00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:33.470
and they say a lot
about the Faroe Islands

00:13:33.470 --> 00:13:37.490
and their geographical position
in the middle of the North

00:13:37.490 --> 00:13:39.160
Atlantic.

00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:41.890
Like these here, for example,
they're legs of mutton.

00:13:41.890 --> 00:13:44.610
And one thing which is
quite interesting with-- not

00:13:44.610 --> 00:13:48.250
only the Faroe Islands, but
with any country in the sort

00:13:48.250 --> 00:13:52.240
of Northeast Atlantic
Region or any part of that--

00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:56.900
is that salt is, like an
historical perspective,

00:13:56.900 --> 00:13:58.864
a rare commodity.

00:13:58.864 --> 00:14:00.530
Simply because there
are no trees there,

00:14:00.530 --> 00:14:03.490
so you can't really evaporate
salt water in salt urns

00:14:03.490 --> 00:14:05.200
like you would, for
example, in the UK

00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:09.080
or in some of the northern
parts of Europe, like Germany.

00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:12.500
And there's not enough
sunshine to produce water

00:14:12.500 --> 00:14:17.300
from salt urns like in Spain,
or France, or Portugal, simply

00:14:17.300 --> 00:14:21.090
by evaporating with solar power.

00:14:21.090 --> 00:14:26.530
So salt, which is something
that most Western palates is

00:14:26.530 --> 00:14:31.399
very tuned in to as a way
of distinguishing safe foods

00:14:31.399 --> 00:14:33.190
from foods that are
going to make you sick,

00:14:33.190 --> 00:14:35.900
is something that's
really rare here.

00:14:35.900 --> 00:14:37.640
And it didn't really
become available

00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:38.600
until modern shipping.

00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:41.090
So we're talking
like 100 years ago.

00:14:41.090 --> 00:14:43.510
Because of this, many of
the traditional preservation

00:14:43.510 --> 00:14:46.007
techniques, they're salt-less.

00:14:46.007 --> 00:14:47.590
And these legs of
mutton, for example,

00:14:47.590 --> 00:14:51.020
they're simply just,
after slaughter, hung up

00:14:51.020 --> 00:14:55.130
in a latticed house close to
the sea called the [INAUDIBLE].

00:14:55.130 --> 00:14:57.590
And because of the location
of the Faroe Islands

00:14:57.590 --> 00:14:59.470
in the middle of
the Gulf Stream,

00:14:59.470 --> 00:15:01.800
it's a very stable
climate both in terms

00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:03.830
of temperature and humidity.

00:15:03.830 --> 00:15:05.280
And in these
particular conditions

00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:11.430
they preserve the meat simply
by creating optimum conditions

00:15:11.430 --> 00:15:15.700
for certain microbiological
flora and fauna.

00:15:15.700 --> 00:15:19.530
Pretty much the same as what
we do with salt in the more

00:15:19.530 --> 00:15:20.800
central parts of Europe.

00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:23.340
Because salt, what it does
when you add salt to meat,

00:15:23.340 --> 00:15:26.470
is that it induces
Lactobacillus fermentation which

00:15:26.470 --> 00:15:29.880
produces lactic acid
and preserves the meat.

00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:33.190
And the difference here in
flavor is quite significant.

00:15:33.190 --> 00:15:36.430
Because most
Westerners are tuned

00:15:36.430 --> 00:15:38.790
in to the very rich
sort of umami flavors

00:15:38.790 --> 00:15:42.690
that lacto-fermentation gives--
whether it's cheese, or olives,

00:15:42.690 --> 00:15:44.370
or ham, or whatever it is.

00:15:44.370 --> 00:15:46.900
It's all the same kind
of indicative flavors

00:15:46.900 --> 00:15:51.910
that we like, simply because
it used to mean safe food.

00:15:51.910 --> 00:15:54.570
And for me, going to
the Faroe Islands, like,

00:15:54.570 --> 00:15:56.940
having a piece of
that, like, my body

00:15:56.940 --> 00:16:00.230
tells me that this is,
like, the worst idea ever.

00:16:00.230 --> 00:16:02.655
You're going to die.

00:16:02.655 --> 00:16:05.030
Even if you can see, like,
ten other people just munching

00:16:05.030 --> 00:16:09.200
away, clearly enjoying it,
simply because my body never

00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:12.300
learned that this is also a
safe way of preserving meats,

00:16:12.300 --> 00:16:12.887
you know.

00:16:12.887 --> 00:16:14.970
And if you don't find this
on top of your sandwich

00:16:14.970 --> 00:16:16.920
in the Faroe Islands,
there's a good chance

00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:19.437
you'll find some rhubarb
marmalade on it-- one

00:16:19.437 --> 00:16:21.770
of the few things that grows
there that you can actually

00:16:21.770 --> 00:16:22.603
turn into marmalade.

00:16:22.603 --> 00:16:25.840
There are no berries at
all growing on that island.

00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:28.170
And the same actually applies
for Iceland, as well--

00:16:28.170 --> 00:16:31.220
loads of rhubarb everywhere.

00:16:31.220 --> 00:16:38.800
Iceland, also being a
Northeastern Atlantic culture,

00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:41.520
they have these salt-less
preservation methods

00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:43.956
like the Faroe Islands.

00:16:43.956 --> 00:16:46.080
And with their mutton, they
have a little addition.

00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:48.880
And they smoke it in small
smokehouses like this.

00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:51.742
And it's a sort of slow
cold-smoking process.

00:16:51.742 --> 00:16:53.700
And then they also store
them in the smokehouse

00:16:53.700 --> 00:16:54.940
after they're done.

00:16:54.940 --> 00:16:57.960
And they, like, pick one down
from the rafters once a week

00:16:57.960 --> 00:16:59.700
or something like that.

00:16:59.700 --> 00:17:03.570
Being a country with
very, very few trees,

00:17:03.570 --> 00:17:07.099
they figured out a different way
of creating the smoke and heat.

00:17:07.099 --> 00:17:12.079
The reason why Iceland doesn't
have many trees is, you know,

00:17:12.079 --> 00:17:15.609
you have the exposed climate,
and it's also very remote.

00:17:15.609 --> 00:17:18.280
But mostly it's because
they have so many sheep

00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:20.180
who eat all the
saplings and produce

00:17:20.180 --> 00:17:22.609
sheep shit, which is
collected and then used

00:17:22.609 --> 00:17:24.637
for fuel in the houses.

00:17:24.637 --> 00:17:25.136
[CHUCKLE]

00:17:25.990 --> 00:17:29.350
Doesn't sound super
appetizing, right?

00:17:29.350 --> 00:17:33.670
So anyhow, that's perhaps
enough talking about sandwiches

00:17:33.670 --> 00:17:36.770
as a cultural marker, even
though it's very interesting,

00:17:36.770 --> 00:17:37.892
I think.

00:17:37.892 --> 00:17:39.350
I'm going to talk
a little bit also

00:17:39.350 --> 00:17:41.840
about how the book
was put together.

00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:45.490
And initially, I wasn't very
keen on doing this project.

00:17:45.490 --> 00:17:47.540
And I was kind of
offended when I

00:17:47.540 --> 00:17:52.350
was asked to do it,
actually-- simply because most

00:17:52.350 --> 00:17:54.280
people living in
the Nordic Region,

00:17:54.280 --> 00:17:57.420
they don't identify
themselves as Nordic.

00:17:57.420 --> 00:17:58.890
Because I am a Swede.

00:17:58.890 --> 00:18:00.220
I'm not Nordic.

00:18:00.220 --> 00:18:02.180
And most people
feel the same way.

00:18:02.180 --> 00:18:04.480
And I thought it was kind
of a little bit like taking,

00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:07.110
you know, Germany,
and some Portuguese,

00:18:07.110 --> 00:18:08.550
and some French,
and some Italian

00:18:08.550 --> 00:18:10.400
cooking and putting
into one book

00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:14.034
and calling it the
"European Cookbook."

00:18:14.034 --> 00:18:15.700
And it really turned
me off of the idea.

00:18:15.700 --> 00:18:20.550
But then, after going back and
forth a little bit about this

00:18:20.550 --> 00:18:24.139
and thinking more about
it, and I actually

00:18:24.139 --> 00:18:25.680
realized that that
was the reason why

00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:27.910
the book should be written.

00:18:27.910 --> 00:18:29.560
And also that the
publisher had clearly

00:18:29.560 --> 00:18:31.180
decided that the book
should be written,

00:18:31.180 --> 00:18:32.805
and I didn't want
anyone else to do it.

00:18:35.740 --> 00:18:39.230
But the fact that most people,
even within the region,

00:18:39.230 --> 00:18:43.200
doesn't know what Nordic
food culture is, I thought

00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:46.860
was really good motivation.

00:18:46.860 --> 00:18:50.020
And the purpose of the
book is to explain this.

00:18:50.020 --> 00:18:55.700
But not just by creating, like,
a very comprehensive collection

00:18:55.700 --> 00:18:56.890
of recipes.

00:18:56.890 --> 00:18:58.390
Because that kind
of already exists,

00:18:58.390 --> 00:19:00.160
and it's not very interesting.

00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:01.660
Because recipes are
just instruction

00:19:01.660 --> 00:19:03.740
on how to produce something.

00:19:03.740 --> 00:19:06.790
I also wanted to
provide a context.

00:19:06.790 --> 00:19:08.320
So it's about half
recipes-- there's

00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:11.430
700-and-something
recipes-- but there is also

00:19:11.430 --> 00:19:14.000
more than 130,000
words of narrative text

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.680
to explain, like, where
the recipes come from,

00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:20.940
and how they all tie together,
and why they make sense

00:19:20.940 --> 00:19:24.769
where they were produced or
where they're still produced.

00:19:24.769 --> 00:19:26.310
I really wanted the
book to be a kind

00:19:26.310 --> 00:19:30.120
of a documentation of where
everything comes from,

00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:30.720
historically.

00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:33.250
Because without that,
you can't really

00:19:33.250 --> 00:19:36.100
understand why we eat
the way we do today.

00:19:36.100 --> 00:19:37.765
But I didn't want
it to become, you

00:19:37.765 --> 00:19:42.891
know, like a romanticized
fairytale version of something

00:19:42.891 --> 00:19:43.390
either.

00:19:43.390 --> 00:19:47.130
So there's a little bit of that,
and then there's also a big

00:19:47.130 --> 00:19:50.090
focus on what people actually
eat today in the Nordic

00:19:50.090 --> 00:19:56.050
Region--- like a snapshot
of the actual food culture.

00:19:56.050 --> 00:19:59.080
And because of this, on top of
those sort of ordinary gravlax,

00:19:59.080 --> 00:20:01.700
and Herring, and
sheep-shit-smoked mutton

00:20:01.700 --> 00:20:05.760
recipes, you're going to
find recipes like this one.

00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:09.020
This is a thoroughly
regional specialty

00:20:09.020 --> 00:20:11.100
from Sweden, the Taco Quiche.

00:20:11.100 --> 00:20:12.080
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:12.947 --> 00:20:14.530
And there was actually
a lot of debate

00:20:14.530 --> 00:20:16.780
on whether recipes like this
were going to be included

00:20:16.780 --> 00:20:18.670
in the book or not.

00:20:18.670 --> 00:20:21.570
Because, like, why is
this a Swedish recipe?

00:20:21.570 --> 00:20:23.840
It's quite interesting
to look at how

00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:28.040
we define what comes
from where, and how we

00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:32.239
define the identity of a dish.

00:20:32.239 --> 00:20:34.030
And with these kind of
more recent recipes,

00:20:34.030 --> 00:20:36.780
this was developed
over the last 30 years,

00:20:36.780 --> 00:20:38.900
it's actually really
easy to figure out

00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:42.260
how they developed, why,
and when it all started.

00:20:42.260 --> 00:20:46.640
And then you can decide
whether it is Swedish or not.

00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:50.110
And with this
particular recipe, like,

00:20:50.110 --> 00:20:52.360
I know where it came from
because I kind of lived when

00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:54.860
that happened, which is
not the case with most

00:20:54.860 --> 00:20:56.990
of the recipes in the book.

00:20:56.990 --> 00:20:59.660
Late '80s, early
'90s, spice companies

00:20:59.660 --> 00:21:03.660
brought kind of the concept
of the taco to Sweden.

00:21:03.660 --> 00:21:06.900
And it wasn't like a real,
authentic, Mexican taco,

00:21:06.900 --> 00:21:10.740
but more of a sort of
bastardized Tex-Mex version,

00:21:10.740 --> 00:21:13.500
and you could buy, like,
taco seasoning kits.

00:21:13.500 --> 00:21:15.820
And it became
very, very popular.

00:21:15.820 --> 00:21:18.400
And as with things
that become popular,

00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:20.960
people start to
consume a lot of it.

00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:23.750
And eventually, they get
a little bit tired of it,

00:21:23.750 --> 00:21:26.850
and they lose the kind of
initial respect for it--

00:21:26.850 --> 00:21:29.210
even if it's just, like,
a taco seasoning kit.

00:21:29.210 --> 00:21:31.102
And then that's when
the interesting stuff

00:21:31.102 --> 00:21:31.810
starts to happen.

00:21:31.810 --> 00:21:35.150
Because that's when
people start to adapt it.

00:21:35.150 --> 00:21:37.120
Because this happens
everywhere, all the time,

00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:39.640
that we start to
adapt things just

00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:42.620
to better suit the circumstances
where we practice our food

00:21:42.620 --> 00:21:45.450
culture and to better
suit our own palates.

00:21:45.450 --> 00:21:47.570
And this has led to
dishes like this one--

00:21:47.570 --> 00:21:52.160
the merge between
Swedish mincemeat pie

00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:56.312
and the taco quiche-- or a taco,
and hence, the taco quiche.

00:21:59.090 --> 00:22:01.620
And it's like, back
to the discussion

00:22:01.620 --> 00:22:05.570
about what makes a dish
a regional specialty.

00:22:05.570 --> 00:22:09.620
If we compare this-- the
taco quiche-- with a dish

00:22:09.620 --> 00:22:14.490
that most Swedes identify as
a very, very Swedish dish--

00:22:14.490 --> 00:22:15.951
the sour herring, surstromming.

00:22:15.951 --> 00:22:17.700
I don't know if anyone's
heard about that.

00:22:17.700 --> 00:22:19.490
Yeah, there are a few nods.

00:22:19.490 --> 00:22:21.030
It's the world's stinkiest food.

00:22:23.460 --> 00:22:27.140
The sour herring is a
fish fermented with salt.

00:22:27.140 --> 00:22:28.490
And that's not unique to Sweden.

00:22:28.490 --> 00:22:30.615
Is actually not unique to
any country in the world,

00:22:30.615 --> 00:22:33.682
because it's done
pretty much anywhere.

00:22:33.682 --> 00:22:35.140
What's unique with
the sour herring

00:22:35.140 --> 00:22:40.510
though, is that it's fermented
was salt in a tin can.

00:22:40.510 --> 00:22:44.390
It produces a very particular
aromatic expression.

00:22:50.470 --> 00:22:52.100
And if we look at
what they both are.

00:22:52.100 --> 00:22:55.520
So, the Baltic herring
produced in a tin

00:22:55.520 --> 00:22:57.780
can, it's produced in
the region, for sure.

00:22:57.780 --> 00:23:01.350
But so is everything on
this picture, as well.

00:23:01.350 --> 00:23:03.897
Like those nachos are
made in Sweden, of course.

00:23:03.897 --> 00:23:05.980
Why would anyone transport
them from anywhere else

00:23:05.980 --> 00:23:07.350
if you can make them on site?

00:23:07.350 --> 00:23:11.422
Same with the store-bought
salsa, medium hot, and the taco

00:23:11.422 --> 00:23:12.770
quiche.

00:23:12.770 --> 00:23:15.110
So that's no longer
a defining factor

00:23:15.110 --> 00:23:19.320
in what's decided what
is a regional specialty.

00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:24.690
If we look at history, we
know that the herring, one

00:23:24.690 --> 00:23:27.330
of the most iconic Swedish
dishes, it needs to

00:23:27.330 --> 00:23:29.590
can to become what it is.

00:23:29.590 --> 00:23:34.020
The tin can wasn't popularized
until the late-20th century.

00:23:34.020 --> 00:23:36.864
So, you know, we can
pretty much assume

00:23:36.864 --> 00:23:38.780
that the sour herring,
at these as we know it,

00:23:38.780 --> 00:23:40.880
is not more than just
over a hundred years old.

00:23:40.880 --> 00:23:44.610
It's very, very short in
a historical perspective.

00:23:44.610 --> 00:23:46.890
The taco quiche, we know
that it came like late '80s

00:23:46.890 --> 00:23:49.240
to early '90s, so
it's about 30 years.

00:23:49.240 --> 00:23:52.280
It's also very short in
a historical perspective.

00:23:52.280 --> 00:23:56.379
And in 500 years, like whether
it was 30 or 100 years,

00:23:56.379 --> 00:23:57.420
it's not going to matter.

00:23:57.420 --> 00:24:01.000
So those are not
defining factors either.

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:05.350
Cultural importance, with food
that's really easy to measure.

00:24:05.350 --> 00:24:08.530
Because you can just watch and
how much people consume on it.

00:24:08.530 --> 00:24:12.000
And if you take 100 Swedes,
and you put them in long row,

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:14.880
and you ask about
their eating habits.

00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:19.310
And you ask them if they eat
sour herring and how often.

00:24:19.310 --> 00:24:22.960
I would say that
maybe 20 of them

00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:25.680
are going to say, yes,
I eat sour herring.

00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:28.680
And out of those 20,
the vast majority

00:24:28.680 --> 00:24:30.792
is going to eat it once a year.

00:24:30.792 --> 00:24:32.000
It's going to be late summer.

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:33.820
There's going to
be midnight sun.

00:24:33.820 --> 00:24:35.676
There's going to be
plenty of Aquavits.

00:24:39.080 --> 00:24:42.720
If you ask the same 100
Swedes about the taco quiche,

00:24:42.720 --> 00:24:46.460
there's going to be
many more than 20.

00:24:46.460 --> 00:24:49.900
And there's going to be many
more of those people eating it

00:24:49.900 --> 00:24:52.750
on an everyday basis.

00:24:52.750 --> 00:24:56.790
So you can then just like ask,
which is the most Swedish dish?

00:24:56.790 --> 00:24:58.640
And you can actually
have a little look.

00:24:58.640 --> 00:24:59.790
It's easy to measure this.

00:24:59.790 --> 00:25:02.560
If you just look at
Google, for example,

00:25:02.560 --> 00:25:05.000
and you put the Swedish name
for taco quiche in there,

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:08.540
you're going to get
175,000 hits from a country

00:25:08.540 --> 00:25:09.880
with 9.6 million people.

00:25:09.880 --> 00:25:12.490
And I know that a taco quiche
doesn't exist anywhere else.

00:25:12.490 --> 00:25:14.777
So they're all from there.

00:25:14.777 --> 00:25:17.110
You're going to get a lot of
sour herring hits, as well,

00:25:17.110 --> 00:25:19.000
but not so many for recipes.

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:21.960
That's for sure.

00:25:21.960 --> 00:25:23.600
And this is actually
quite interesting

00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:25.840
because you can really
look at the difference

00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:31.570
between perceived reality, what
we think is our food culture,

00:25:31.570 --> 00:25:34.830
and real reality, which is
what we actually consume.

00:25:34.830 --> 00:25:38.280
And most of those
dishes that people think

00:25:38.280 --> 00:25:41.830
is Swedish food culture, or
Nordic food culture, they are.

00:25:41.830 --> 00:25:44.810
But they are not very
significant anymore.

00:25:44.810 --> 00:25:49.740
The most common recipe
search from Sweden

00:25:49.740 --> 00:25:52.010
is from something
called Kladdkaka,

00:25:52.010 --> 00:25:56.390
means gooey chocolate cake,
which is also a recent recipe.

00:25:56.390 --> 00:26:02.010
It was first kind of
conceived in the mid '70s,

00:26:02.010 --> 00:26:03.080
something like that.

00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:04.760
And you track it from
when it was first

00:26:04.760 --> 00:26:07.460
published in a magazine
called "Allt on mat"

00:26:07.460 --> 00:26:09.810
until it's developed
into what it is today.

00:26:09.810 --> 00:26:14.410
And that has 750,000 hits.

00:26:14.410 --> 00:26:18.790
That says quite a lot
about food culture.

00:26:18.790 --> 00:26:26.300
So, anyhow, after doing
research for about two years,

00:26:26.300 --> 00:26:28.090
we had loads of material.

00:26:28.090 --> 00:26:30.880
I'd traveled all
across the region.

00:26:30.880 --> 00:26:33.169
We put up a
web-based poll to ask

00:26:33.169 --> 00:26:35.210
people what they thought
about their food culture

00:26:35.210 --> 00:26:37.040
and to submit recipes.

00:26:37.040 --> 00:26:40.500
And it was sort of time to
start compiling an index.

00:26:40.500 --> 00:26:42.410
And I did it first.

00:26:42.410 --> 00:26:45.640
I did a selection that
I felt represented

00:26:45.640 --> 00:26:48.880
all the different parts
of the Nordic Region well.

00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:51.500
And then I sent this
selection of recipes,

00:26:51.500 --> 00:26:55.550
or the index, out to one expert
in each of the separate regions

00:26:55.550 --> 00:26:57.530
or countries to review.

00:26:57.530 --> 00:27:00.060
And they came back with
feedback on what was missing,

00:27:00.060 --> 00:27:03.090
what was superfluous, what
was misspelled in Finnish,

00:27:03.090 --> 00:27:05.400
and all kinds of
stuff like that.

00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:09.910
And this resulted in a kind
of edited-down version,

00:27:09.910 --> 00:27:13.350
containing
730-something recipes.

00:27:13.350 --> 00:27:16.190
And I started actually
producing the content.

00:27:16.190 --> 00:27:19.170
When that was done, the
whole content of the book

00:27:19.170 --> 00:27:22.550
was sent out to all of
these experts one more time.

00:27:22.550 --> 00:27:25.460
And they go to review the
actual methods and the content

00:27:25.460 --> 00:27:27.610
in the recipes themselves
and send them back again.

00:27:31.670 --> 00:27:35.950
Next step was to copy edit
the book, like you do.

00:27:35.950 --> 00:27:38.610
And then the final step
was to send the whole book

00:27:38.610 --> 00:27:41.240
to a guy named
Richard Tellstrom.

00:27:41.240 --> 00:27:44.330
He's an associate
professor in ethnology

00:27:44.330 --> 00:27:47.580
who specializes in the
meal as a cultural marker.

00:27:47.580 --> 00:27:49.480
And he reviewed the
whole book and made sure,

00:27:49.480 --> 00:27:51.679
like, all of the dates
where in order and all

00:27:51.679 --> 00:27:53.220
that-- which they
weren't, obviously.

00:27:56.740 --> 00:27:59.670
And I think one of
the great challenges

00:27:59.670 --> 00:28:03.280
for me, as a food professional,
with writing a book

00:28:03.280 --> 00:28:08.030
like this which is mainly
targeted on the person who

00:28:08.030 --> 00:28:13.965
has quite a limited knowledge
about the topic of the book--

00:28:13.965 --> 00:28:16.090
regardless if you are from
the Nordic Region itself

00:28:16.090 --> 00:28:19.640
or from somewhere outside
of the region-- is

00:28:19.640 --> 00:28:23.322
that you have to eliminate
all of the assumed knowledge.

00:28:23.322 --> 00:28:24.530
And this is really difficult.

00:28:24.530 --> 00:28:26.710
It sounds like an easy task.

00:28:26.710 --> 00:28:29.260
You just have to explain how
everything actually works.

00:28:29.260 --> 00:28:31.450
But it's so easy to
just slip little pieces

00:28:31.450 --> 00:28:34.136
of assumed knowledge
into a method.

00:28:34.136 --> 00:28:38.850
And like, I tried about
400 of the recipes

00:28:38.850 --> 00:28:41.160
from the book myself, in
my own kitchen at home,

00:28:41.160 --> 00:28:44.480
to see that they actually worked
in a home environment and all

00:28:44.480 --> 00:28:45.330
that.

00:28:45.330 --> 00:28:47.530
And the rest of
them were tried on--

00:28:47.530 --> 00:28:49.680
out in the field when I
collected the recipes.

00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:53.060
And when we had done that,
we sent about 100 recipes out

00:28:53.060 --> 00:28:56.890
to different testers in
different parts of the world,

00:28:56.890 --> 00:29:00.174
to see, like, to
really try to make sure

00:29:00.174 --> 00:29:02.340
that we didn't have too
much assumed knowledge left.

00:29:02.340 --> 00:29:06.380
And it was quite interesting
to see what came back.

00:29:06.380 --> 00:29:11.870
So this is from me testing at
my house, different recipes.

00:29:11.870 --> 00:29:13.260
The first one
there was lutefisk.

00:29:13.260 --> 00:29:15.730
This is split pea soup.

00:29:15.730 --> 00:29:17.820
This is some spinach dishes.

00:29:17.820 --> 00:29:20.258
And then stuff like this
started coming back.

00:29:20.258 --> 00:29:21.130
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:22.070 --> 00:29:23.780
And this is a
really good example

00:29:23.780 --> 00:29:27.100
where I thought I had
explained very, very

00:29:27.100 --> 00:29:29.690
well how it was going to be.

00:29:29.690 --> 00:29:32.775
Because this is something
called [SWEDISH].

00:29:32.775 --> 00:29:34.860
It's a layer cake.

00:29:34.860 --> 00:29:39.210
And all of the different
parts of this-- the cake,

00:29:39.210 --> 00:29:41.240
the filling, the cream,
the various-- it's

00:29:41.240 --> 00:29:43.090
perfectly executed.

00:29:43.090 --> 00:29:45.510
Like, the person who's
tested this, she's

00:29:45.510 --> 00:29:48.880
followed the recipe,
every detail.

00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:52.595
And for me, I just hadn't
said how to assemble it.

00:29:52.595 --> 00:29:54.806
[LAUGHTER] Because to
me, it's so obvious.

00:29:54.806 --> 00:29:56.180
There's only one
way of doing it.

00:29:56.180 --> 00:29:58.711
So I didn't even
think about that.

00:29:58.711 --> 00:30:00.460
And this probably
tastes kind of the same,

00:30:00.460 --> 00:30:01.740
but it looks completely wrong.

00:30:01.740 --> 00:30:03.350
It looks nothing
like a layer cake

00:30:03.350 --> 00:30:06.090
would in the Nordic Region.

00:30:06.090 --> 00:30:09.990
This is another one that's
really interesting, as well.

00:30:09.990 --> 00:30:13.100
So in Swedish this
is called [SWEDISH].

00:30:13.100 --> 00:30:15.930
It's like a chocolate sponge
with a chocolate glaze

00:30:15.930 --> 00:30:18.600
and some coconut
shavings on top.

00:30:18.600 --> 00:30:21.975
And it turns out
that here in the US--

00:30:21.975 --> 00:30:23.850
because this is an
American recipe tester who

00:30:23.850 --> 00:30:27.590
tried this one--
the round cake tins,

00:30:27.590 --> 00:30:30.690
they are 25 millimeters
smaller in diameter

00:30:30.690 --> 00:30:33.210
than the Swedish ones.

00:30:33.210 --> 00:30:34.980
So the cake is
almost 50% higher.

00:30:37.550 --> 00:30:42.050
Like, who thinks about that
stuff when you write a book?

00:30:42.050 --> 00:30:44.480
This here is also-- I don't
know what happened here--

00:30:44.480 --> 00:30:46.910
but this is supposed
to be pickled herring.

00:30:46.910 --> 00:30:50.050
Clearly there's
something wrong there.

00:30:50.050 --> 00:30:53.500
Anyhow, that's "The
Nordic Cook Book,"

00:30:53.500 --> 00:30:55.160
and thank you so
much for coming.

00:31:06.006 --> 00:31:08.802
Does anyone have any questions?

00:31:08.802 --> 00:31:11.688
AUDIENCE: You can probably
hear me right there.

00:31:11.688 --> 00:31:13.104
FEMALE SPEAKER:
But the recording.

00:31:19.290 --> 00:31:21.540
AUDIENCE: Thank you so much
for coming to speak to us.

00:31:21.540 --> 00:31:23.331
MAGNUS NILSSON: Well,
thanks for having me.

00:31:23.331 --> 00:31:24.800
AUDIENCE: And I've
had your food.

00:31:24.800 --> 00:31:30.440
And I am very glad that you're
a great writer and speaker.

00:31:30.440 --> 00:31:32.910
What I wanted to ask
you is, you showed up

00:31:32.910 --> 00:31:36.316
some things that seem that are
easy enough to make at home,

00:31:36.316 --> 00:31:38.190
but a lot of what you
use in your own cooking

00:31:38.190 --> 00:31:39.800
has to deal with
cooking over fire.

00:31:39.800 --> 00:31:40.760
MAGNUS NILSSON: Yeah.

00:31:40.760 --> 00:31:43.790
AUDIENCE: Do you have
anything to recommend for us,

00:31:43.790 --> 00:31:47.276
with our tiny New York apartment
kitchens and fire regulations?

00:31:47.276 --> 00:31:48.150
MAGNUS NILSSON: Yeah.

00:31:48.150 --> 00:31:48.649
Exactly.

00:31:48.649 --> 00:31:50.450
We shouldn't violate those.

00:31:53.220 --> 00:31:56.250
For me, like, it was really
important to remove the way

00:31:56.250 --> 00:31:58.340
I cook professionally
from producing this book.

00:31:58.340 --> 00:32:00.100
Because this-- there's
not a single recipe

00:32:00.100 --> 00:32:02.810
in this book that's
actually mine.

00:32:02.810 --> 00:32:06.020
So it's just a document
of what people actually

00:32:06.020 --> 00:32:07.200
cook in their homes.

00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:09.280
So what I cook at
Faviken and, like,

00:32:09.280 --> 00:32:11.802
what was in the Faviken
book, my first book,

00:32:11.802 --> 00:32:13.260
is quite different
from this stuff.

00:32:13.260 --> 00:32:17.740
And I would say that out to the
730-something recipes, about 50

00:32:17.740 --> 00:32:21.480
of them, no one is
ever going to cook.

00:32:21.480 --> 00:32:23.530
They're just there
to explain something.

00:32:23.530 --> 00:32:25.740
Either because they're
ridiculously complicated

00:32:25.740 --> 00:32:27.300
and take several
weeks to reproduce,

00:32:27.300 --> 00:32:29.360
or because you just
can't get the produce.

00:32:29.360 --> 00:32:33.410
But the remaining
670-something recipes,

00:32:33.410 --> 00:32:37.275
they are representative
of what people actually

00:32:37.275 --> 00:32:38.890
eat in an everyday basis.

00:32:38.890 --> 00:32:41.760
And if someone can cook it
in their little apartment

00:32:41.760 --> 00:32:44.970
kitchen in Stockholm
or in Oslo, you're

00:32:44.970 --> 00:32:47.470
probably going to be able to
cook it here, as well, I think.

00:32:47.470 --> 00:32:49.940
They're quite accessible.

00:32:49.940 --> 00:32:52.240
AUDIENCE: So there are a
lot of universal things

00:32:52.240 --> 00:32:53.410
to what you talk about.

00:32:53.410 --> 00:32:56.360
Because a lot of this
is very regional,

00:32:56.360 --> 00:33:00.240
but I would say that
you can-- I guess,

00:33:00.240 --> 00:33:03.120
when you come to
America, you see how

00:33:03.120 --> 00:33:05.670
we do our tacos and all that.

00:33:05.670 --> 00:33:08.324
So is there something that
you've learned about the, sort

00:33:08.324 --> 00:33:11.477
of, the universal cook book?

00:33:11.477 --> 00:33:12.310
MAGNUS NILSSON: Yes.

00:33:12.310 --> 00:33:14.810
There's one thing that's
actually really important.

00:33:14.810 --> 00:33:17.850
And it's that there is no such
thing as a recipe that works

00:33:17.850 --> 00:33:20.440
everywhere and every time.

00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:24.900
And the idea of a recipe that's
bulletproof, it's just flawed.

00:33:24.900 --> 00:33:26.310
Because it will never happen.

00:33:26.310 --> 00:33:28.840
Because produce is different
from country to country,

00:33:28.840 --> 00:33:29.990
and from time to time.

00:33:29.990 --> 00:33:32.030
And we're working with
biological material,

00:33:32.030 --> 00:33:35.560
so it's really something
that you have to adapt to.

00:33:35.560 --> 00:33:41.470
And I think that, like, you
have to look at the recipe.

00:33:41.470 --> 00:33:45.980
And by doing so, get instruction
on kind of how to proceed,

00:33:45.980 --> 00:33:48.850
but then you still have
to be able to assess

00:33:48.850 --> 00:33:51.350
whether something is good or
not, whether something is tasty

00:33:51.350 --> 00:33:52.960
or not, and so on.

00:33:52.960 --> 00:33:56.770
And you have to allow
yourself to also adapt

00:33:56.770 --> 00:33:58.450
so that it suits the
circumstances where

00:33:58.450 --> 00:33:59.870
the recipe is made.

00:33:59.870 --> 00:34:02.530
And it's like-- if
you live in Italy,

00:34:02.530 --> 00:34:05.240
you're not going to be able to
get fresh herring, for example.

00:34:05.240 --> 00:34:08.300
But you can substitute
that with sardines.

00:34:08.300 --> 00:34:11.949
It's not going to be the same,
but it's going to be tasty.

00:34:11.949 --> 00:34:13.591
And maybe that's
sort of what matters.

00:34:17.519 --> 00:34:19.270
Any other questions?

00:34:19.270 --> 00:34:20.493
Yeah.

00:34:20.493 --> 00:34:21.659
AUDIENCE: Thank you, Magnus.

00:34:21.659 --> 00:34:22.409
That was fascinating.

00:34:22.409 --> 00:34:23.520
MAGNUS NILSSON: Thank you.

00:34:23.520 --> 00:34:25.520
AUDIENCE: I have actually
the opposite question.

00:34:25.520 --> 00:34:28.860
That is, by going through
this process for the last 24,

00:34:28.860 --> 00:34:32.370
36 months, how has that actually
influenced your own cooking

00:34:32.370 --> 00:34:34.829
within your own kitchen
and dish selection?

00:34:34.829 --> 00:34:36.370
MAGNUS NILSSON: It's
actually like, I

00:34:36.370 --> 00:34:39.770
didn't think it was going
to influence what I do much.

00:34:39.770 --> 00:34:42.659
Because I thought,
well, it's home cooking.

00:34:42.659 --> 00:34:45.170
But by doing this sort
of research process

00:34:45.170 --> 00:34:46.750
and by putting
the book together,

00:34:46.750 --> 00:34:51.050
I really realized
how much of what

00:34:51.050 --> 00:34:54.080
I already do that has it's
origins in home cooking.

00:34:54.080 --> 00:34:56.000
Because we know
home cooking, there

00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:57.990
will be no professional cooking.

00:34:57.990 --> 00:35:01.709
Like, that's where the
food culture comes from.

00:35:01.709 --> 00:35:03.250
And there are
definitely dishes today

00:35:03.250 --> 00:35:06.810
at the menu at Faviken
that have components

00:35:06.810 --> 00:35:09.170
from this sort of
research process.

00:35:09.170 --> 00:35:11.840
And I think that,
over the next years,

00:35:11.840 --> 00:35:14.710
there is going to be much
more coming in, for sure,

00:35:14.710 --> 00:35:17.025
that sort of ties into this.

00:35:17.025 --> 00:35:17.858
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:35:17.858 --> 00:35:18.941
MAGNUS NILSSON: Thank you.

00:35:24.489 --> 00:35:25.030
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:35:25.030 --> 00:35:27.010
Thank you for coming.

00:35:27.010 --> 00:35:30.340
In your copious
research, is there

00:35:30.340 --> 00:35:33.930
anything you can recall
really, really surprising

00:35:33.930 --> 00:35:36.430
you or delighting you
that you discovered?

00:35:36.430 --> 00:35:38.040
MAGNUS NILSSON: Yes.

00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:40.640
So the most surprising
thing to me,

00:35:40.640 --> 00:35:42.490
having a special
interest in Nordic

00:35:42.490 --> 00:35:44.136
cooking already
from the beginning

00:35:44.136 --> 00:35:45.510
and doing quite
a lot of research

00:35:45.510 --> 00:35:49.300
already for the restaurant
before this, what surprised me

00:35:49.300 --> 00:35:54.500
the most was that I thought I
knew a lot about Nordic cooking

00:35:54.500 --> 00:35:56.180
when I started, and
I realized halfway

00:35:56.180 --> 00:35:59.412
through that I knew almost
nothing about the diversity

00:35:59.412 --> 00:36:00.870
that you have in
the Nordic Region.

00:36:00.870 --> 00:36:03.190
And that was really
very fascinating to see

00:36:03.190 --> 00:36:04.447
how much there is.

00:36:04.447 --> 00:36:05.280
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:36:08.395 --> 00:36:09.290
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:36:09.290 --> 00:36:11.400
I have a bit of a
different question.

00:36:11.400 --> 00:36:14.810
I'm curious how you
experience a food culture

00:36:14.810 --> 00:36:17.525
in a place like New York City?

00:36:17.525 --> 00:36:19.650
When you're-- I don't know
how often you come here.

00:36:19.650 --> 00:36:24.370
But when you do, do you go
to the fanciest restaurants,

00:36:24.370 --> 00:36:27.190
or do you just stop
anywhere that looks good?

00:36:27.190 --> 00:36:30.380
MAGNUS NILSSON: Well, I think
the thing with restaurants

00:36:30.380 --> 00:36:33.190
is that-- the most important
with any restaurant

00:36:33.190 --> 00:36:36.311
is that it kind of reflects
its place, regardless where

00:36:36.311 --> 00:36:36.810
that is.

00:36:36.810 --> 00:36:38.934
And for me, for example,
like, running a restaurant

00:36:38.934 --> 00:36:40.970
in the countryside
of northern Sweden,

00:36:40.970 --> 00:36:44.690
obviously that reflects
quite a lot into what we do.

00:36:44.690 --> 00:36:47.230
We use produce from
the immediate region,

00:36:47.230 --> 00:36:49.220
simply because it makes sense.

00:36:49.220 --> 00:36:51.780
It's the best way for
us to get great quality.

00:36:51.780 --> 00:36:53.740
And I think the same
goes for a city.

00:36:53.740 --> 00:36:58.710
Like, you have to make as most
of the circumstances you have.

00:36:58.710 --> 00:37:02.090
In a city, that'll probably
be, like, a very varied

00:37:02.090 --> 00:37:06.100
and big influx of produce
and a huge influence

00:37:06.100 --> 00:37:07.322
from different cultures.

00:37:07.322 --> 00:37:09.780
So I think that's-- like, when
I come to a place like this,

00:37:09.780 --> 00:37:11.850
that's what I like
to experience.

00:37:11.850 --> 00:37:15.010
Because that's something that I
don't have at home, basically.

00:37:15.010 --> 00:37:17.910
AUDIENCE: Do you have any
favorite restaurants here?

00:37:17.910 --> 00:37:18.410
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:18.410 --> 00:37:21.684
MAGNUS NILSSON:
Oh, I have so many.

00:37:21.684 --> 00:37:24.240
I have-- I come
here quite often,

00:37:24.240 --> 00:37:26.640
and I have a lot of
favorite restaurants.

00:37:26.640 --> 00:37:28.086
I'm not going to say, though.

00:37:28.086 --> 00:37:29.489
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:29.489 --> 00:37:30.030
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:37:33.497 --> 00:37:35.330
AUDIENCE: As you've
shown, the Nordic Region

00:37:35.330 --> 00:37:36.780
is a fairly large region.

00:37:36.780 --> 00:37:39.180
And when you get to some parts
of Greenland, for example,

00:37:39.180 --> 00:37:40.760
you start to get
closer to Canada

00:37:40.760 --> 00:37:42.890
than, like, the
core of Scandinavia,

00:37:42.890 --> 00:37:44.582
and same for the
edges of Finland.

00:37:44.582 --> 00:37:47.040
So I was wondering, have you
seen any interesting crossover

00:37:47.040 --> 00:37:50.915
near these border areas?

00:37:50.915 --> 00:37:51.790
MAGNUS NILSSON: Yeah.

00:37:51.790 --> 00:37:53.748
You can actually see it
all through the region.

00:37:53.748 --> 00:37:58.470
Because the Nordic Region can be
divided into cultural regions.

00:37:58.470 --> 00:38:02.610
And it all has to do with who
made war with who and when.

00:38:02.610 --> 00:38:05.590
Basically, who occupied who.

00:38:05.590 --> 00:38:08.020
And the western part, the
biggest part of the Nordics,

00:38:08.020 --> 00:38:11.150
has clearly been
influenced by Denmark.

00:38:11.150 --> 00:38:13.960
Greenland, Iceland,
and the Faroe Islands

00:38:13.960 --> 00:38:17.080
is clearly influenced by
Denmark and Danish culture,

00:38:17.080 --> 00:38:19.330
in a historical perspective.

00:38:19.330 --> 00:38:21.360
And then the kind
of eastern part,

00:38:21.360 --> 00:38:23.720
which is today only
Finland, is influenced

00:38:23.720 --> 00:38:26.670
by Sweden who occupied, like,
whole Baltic area a long time

00:38:26.670 --> 00:38:27.991
ago.

00:38:27.991 --> 00:38:29.990
And then you have Norway,
kind of in the middle,

00:38:29.990 --> 00:38:31.840
which was Danish
for a long time,

00:38:31.840 --> 00:38:34.320
but which was also in
a union with Sweden

00:38:34.320 --> 00:38:36.100
until 1890-- which
is quite recently.

00:38:36.100 --> 00:38:37.660
So there you can see two layers.

00:38:37.660 --> 00:38:40.020
Like, you'll have a Danish
base, kind of mingled

00:38:40.020 --> 00:38:45.140
in with the regional
specialties of Norway.

00:38:45.140 --> 00:38:48.775
And then, stuff that happened
during the 19th century,

00:38:48.775 --> 00:38:50.400
you'll have a lot of
Swedish influence,

00:38:50.400 --> 00:38:52.874
as well-- because of the union.

00:38:52.874 --> 00:38:54.040
And you see that everywhere.

00:38:54.040 --> 00:38:57.840
Like Finland, you have
the whole Russian culture

00:38:57.840 --> 00:38:59.470
coming into the country.

00:38:59.470 --> 00:39:02.780
Greenland, you have the Innuit
culture mixing with Danish food

00:39:02.780 --> 00:39:03.760
culture.

00:39:03.760 --> 00:39:06.200
So it's really like,
it happens everywhere.

00:39:06.200 --> 00:39:08.600
And sometimes we kind
of fool ourselves

00:39:08.600 --> 00:39:10.870
that we are the first
couple of generations

00:39:10.870 --> 00:39:12.889
who's been traveling a lot.

00:39:12.889 --> 00:39:15.430
People have obviously been doing
that for a really long time.

00:39:15.430 --> 00:39:19.176
And you can really see
that in the food culture.

00:39:19.176 --> 00:39:20.990
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:39:20.990 --> 00:39:22.383
MAGNUS NILSSON: Good.

00:39:22.383 --> 00:39:24.632
FEMALE SPEAKER: Help me thank
Magnus for coming today.

00:39:24.632 --> 00:39:25.965
MAGNUS NILSSON: Thank you, guys.

00:39:28.632 --> 00:39:31.150
Thank you so much for
coming to listen to this.
