52 times a half is 26, and then I have 2w plus 6 on the right side. I don't have

00:00:04.549 --> 00:00:09.289
any multiplication here, this is addition. I'm just adding w to its like term.

00:00:09.394 --> 00:00:14.252
Subtracting 6 from both sides, we get 20 equals 2w, then we divide both sides by

00:00:14.264 --> 00:00:18.950
2, so we're left with 1w is equal to 10. We know the width, but we need to keep

00:00:18.962 --> 00:00:23.768
in mind that we still need to find the length. Let's check in with our diagram.

00:00:23.868 --> 00:00:28.111
I can replace these w's with 10, so each side is 10 feet. Now, you could have

00:00:28.123 --> 00:00:32.518
reasoned your way and figured out the length of l since you know the perimeter

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:36.798
has to add up to 52. Or you could be a little bit more clever. You could just

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:40.955
say the length of the rectangle is 6 more than the width. So, to find the

00:00:40.967 --> 00:00:45.355
length, I just have to take the width and add 6, so the length needs to be 16.

00:00:45.457 --> 00:00:50.005
And you could, of course, check your answer by finding the perimeter. Add up all

00:00:50.017 --> 00:00:54.450
the sides and your perimeter should be 52. Hopefully, you use your equation

00:00:54.462 --> 00:00:56.160
skills and got that one right.
