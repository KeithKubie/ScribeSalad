00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:03.070
So we have the graph of a
function right over here,

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:04.750
and we want to think
about what does

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:09.861
the limit of f of x as x
approaches 3 appear to be?

00:00:09.861 --> 00:00:11.860
And to do that, let's
just think about the limit

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:14.550
as x approaches 3 from
values less than 3,

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:16.680
and from values greater than 3.

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.920
So let's first think
about the limit

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:24.580
of f of x as x approaches
3 from values less than 3.

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:26.640
So this little
negative superscript

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.350
says we're going to
approach 3 from below 3.

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:33.880
From 1, 2, 2.5, 2.99, 2.999.

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:38.220
So if we approach-- so
this is 3 right over here.

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:41.530
And we're going take the left
handed, or the left sided

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:42.030
limit.

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.270
We're going to approach 3
from this direction first.

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.570
So when x is 0, f of x is there.

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:49.680
When x is 1, f of x is there.

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.900
When x is 2, f of x is there.

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:54.980
When x is 2 and
1/2, f of x is at 5.

00:00:54.980 --> 00:01:00.780
When x is at-- looks like
roughly 2 and 3/4, we get to 4.

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.740
Looks like about f
of x gets to 4.5.

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:06.510
And so it looks like
as x approaches 3

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.210
from values less
than 3, it looks

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.470
like our function
is approaching 4.

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.230
So I would say it looks
like the left sided

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:20.970
limit of f of x as
x approaches 3 is 4.

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.490
Now let's do the same thing
for the right hand side.

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:32.310
So the limit of f of x
as x approaches 3 from

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.570
values larger than 3.

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:38.500
So notice when x is equal
to 5, our f of x is up here.

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.340
When x is equal to
4, f of x is here.

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:45.930
When x is 3 and 1/2, it looks
like we're a little under 2

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.110
for f of x.

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:49.370
And it looks like we're
getting closer and closer

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:53.105
as x approaches 3 from
the positive direction,

00:01:53.105 --> 00:01:55.960
or from the right
side, it looks like f

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:01.410
of x is getting closer
and closer to 1.

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:04.300
So I would estimate,
based on this graph,

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:06.430
that the limit of f
of x as x approaches 3

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:10.820
from the positive
direction is equal to 1.

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:12.090
Now we have an issue.

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.230
In order for this
limit to exist,

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:18.600
we have to get the same value as
we approach from the left hand

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.290
side and the right hand
side, but it's clear

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:23.340
that we are not approaching
the same value when

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.360
we go from the left
hand side as we

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.690
do when we go from
the right hand side.

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:32.010
So this limit right over
here does not exist.

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.882
Does not exist.

00:02:35.882 --> 00:02:37.590
The only way that this
would have existed

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.430
is if we got the same
value for both of these,

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:42.140
and then the limit
would be that value.

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.280
But we're clearly not
getting the same value.
