00:00:01.084 --> 00:00:02.377
[thud]

00:00:11.344 --> 00:00:14.305
Greetings, brothers.

00:00:14.305 --> 00:00:15.974
Forgive our surprise.

00:00:15.974 --> 00:00:17.225
We're expecting to see some
of our own Templar brothers.

00:00:17.225 --> 00:00:18.393
Of course.

00:00:18.393 --> 00:00:20.979
And what brings
you so far from--

00:00:20.979 --> 00:00:21.730
Hautville.

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:22.689
Hautville.

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:25.358
That's quite a distance.

00:00:25.358 --> 00:00:28.027
There's been
rumor of a Templar

00:00:28.027 --> 00:00:31.364
frequenting this convent
engaging in unspeakable acts.

00:00:34.367 --> 00:00:35.535
What unspeakable acts?

00:00:35.535 --> 00:00:38.788
[music playing]

00:00:42.292 --> 00:00:44.961
MAN 1: Identify yourselves.

00:00:44.961 --> 00:00:46.963
If neither of you are
the Templar I speak of,

00:00:46.963 --> 00:00:49.299
you have nothing to fear.

00:00:49.299 --> 00:00:52.010
MAN 2: My name is
Tancrede de Hautville.

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:53.344
MAN 3: I'm Landry du Lauzon.

00:00:53.344 --> 00:00:56.723
[music playing]

00:01:02.812 --> 00:01:04.522
MAN 1: Brother,
why would you draw

00:01:04.522 --> 00:01:06.399
your sword on a fellow Templar?

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:08.067
Because I know that horse.

00:01:08.067 --> 00:01:10.361
And because Templars carry
swords, not cross bows.

00:01:10.361 --> 00:01:11.946
[music playing]

00:01:11.946 --> 00:01:13.198
And because you
are not Templars.

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:17.994
Kill them!

00:01:17.994 --> 00:01:18.745
[grunting]

00:01:18.745 --> 00:01:19.329
MAN 3: Inside!

00:01:24.083 --> 00:01:25.126
Get yourself to safety.

00:01:25.126 --> 00:01:26.169
Tell the rest of your sisters.

00:01:26.169 --> 00:01:27.170
Find a room, lock the door.

00:01:29.923 --> 00:01:31.257
Let's go.
WOMAN: I'm not leaving.

00:01:31.257 --> 00:01:32.258
MAN 2: There's no time, Anne.

00:01:32.258 --> 00:01:33.510
Tancrede, this is my home.

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:34.761
Dangerous men
impersonating Templars--

00:01:34.761 --> 00:01:35.386
- We have to go.
- --are here.

00:01:35.386 --> 00:01:36.262
Come on.

00:01:36.262 --> 00:01:37.263
We have to leave, Anne.

00:01:37.263 --> 00:01:38.306
Anne, please.

00:01:38.306 --> 00:01:39.849
[music playing]

00:01:39.849 --> 00:01:40.558
Come on.

00:01:40.558 --> 00:01:41.226
All right.

00:01:41.226 --> 00:01:44.145
[music playing]

00:01:45.063 --> 00:01:46.064
Get the horses.

00:01:46.064 --> 00:01:47.148
Take the roads to Chartres.

00:01:47.148 --> 00:01:48.024
We'll be right behind you.

00:01:48.024 --> 00:01:48.733
[loud bang]

00:01:48.733 --> 00:01:49.776
[music playing]

00:01:49.776 --> 00:01:50.485
Go.

00:01:50.485 --> 00:01:51.778

00:01:51.778 --> 00:01:52.487

00:02:09.254 --> 00:02:12.590
[grunting]

00:02:26.604 --> 00:02:29.107
We're going to kill
you and then your baby.

00:02:29.107 --> 00:02:32.402
[grunting]

00:02:54.757 --> 00:02:55.425
WOMAN: Hurry.

00:02:55.425 --> 00:02:56.885
Hurry up.

00:02:56.885 --> 00:02:58.845
[panting]

00:02:58.845 --> 00:02:59.846
MAN 4: Who are you?

00:02:59.846 --> 00:03:01.222
I've done nothing to you.

00:03:01.222 --> 00:03:03.141
Oh, but you have, Landry.

00:03:03.141 --> 00:03:06.519
[grunting]

00:03:16.821 --> 00:03:17.822

MAN 5: Prince Louis.

00:03:35.048 --> 00:03:37.050
MAN 1: They're getting
away with the baby!

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:38.801
Gaylord, kill the Templar!

00:03:38.801 --> 00:03:40.845
[grunting]

00:03:45.016 --> 00:03:47.644
Go, go, go, go!

00:03:47.644 --> 00:03:50.855
