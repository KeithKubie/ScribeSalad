Hi, I'm Craig and this is Crash Course Government
and Politics and today we're gonna talk about

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:13.820
parties. Woo! Yeah! No, not those kind of
parties. We're talking about political parties,

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.970
which can be a lot less fun. Woo.

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:27.820
[Theme Music]

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:31.300
So, today we're talking about why we have
political parties and the role of parties

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:35.230
in American politics. But before we dive into
the pool - some would say a cesspool - that

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:39.480
is political parties, let's have a definition.
Political party: a team of politicians, activists

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.159
and voters whose goal is to win control of
government. So kind of an important point:

00:00:43.159 --> 00:00:46.629
the goal of a party is to control government
and in the U.S. that means electing people

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:50.350
who agree with and usually are members of
the party. So above everything else, parties

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:54.870
exist to win elections. Parties don't mainly
focus on influencing policies, although particular

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.079
policies are often associated with particular
parties. Influencing elected officials is

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:02.920
mainly the job of interest groups, who we'll
talk about soon. For now, let's keep in mind

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.590
that political parties and interest groups
are not the same thing.

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:10.040
So let's look at three reasons why we have
political parties. One: I dunno. Two: I dunno.

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:15.030
Three: I dunno. I do know, I'll tell you in
a second. First, we create political parties

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.710
to facilitate collective action in the electoral
process. Given that parties exist to win elections,

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.409
this is probably the main reason we have them.
But what does facilitate collective action

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:27.280
in the electoral process mean exactly? Basically,
it means that parties make it easier for voters

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:31.909
to form groups that will vote in certain ways.
Here's an example, albeit one that overgeneralizes

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:35.939
a little bit. Just come on, just go with it.
In general, republican candidates support

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:39.180
policies that are more friendly to business,
so if you're a businessman, you know that

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.619
affiliating yourself with the republican party
is probably going to benefit you.

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:46.459
The second reason given for forming political
parties is that they facilitate policy making.

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:50.080
This reasoning applies to elected members
who being to political parties, not to voters.

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:53.539
So membership in a party allows politicians
to work together. It's easier for democrats

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:57.359
to form alliances with other democrats and
sometimes these alliances have the added benefit

00:01:57.359 --> 00:02:00.659
of strengthening the party. Party affiliation
can help legislators from different places

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:04.770
work together. For example, common republicanness
should make it easier for a republican from

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.649
rural Kansas to work with another republican
from suburban Florida. Sometimes though, party

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:12.680
ideology can prevent even members of the same
party from working together as happened in

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.340
2008 when republicans couldn't agree on whether
the government should bail out struggling banks.

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.440
A third, and I must say not altogether convincing
reason why we have political parties is to

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:24.319
deal with the problem of politicians' ambition.
According to this idea, parties provide a

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:27.900
structure, maybe even a career ladder for
politicians so that they're not always acting

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.459
in their own self interest. The fact that
the party provides different leadership possibilities

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:35.480
and some sense of discipline prevents ambitious
politicians with largely similar views from

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.830
competing against each other, like say 16
candidates running for president all in the

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:42.260
same party. Just wouldn't happen. Ever.

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.890
So that's why political parties exist, but
what do they do? Well, they have five main

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:50.380
functions in the U.S. and I'll leave it up to you
to decide which - if any - is the most important.

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:54.040
Eagle doesn't get to decide.
Eagle doesn't get to decide anything.

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:58.920
So here's the list: 1. Recruit candidates;
2. Nominate candidates; 3. Get out the vote;

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:02.940
4. Facilitate electoral choice;
5. Influence national government.

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:06.260
The first thing that parties have to do if
they want to win elections is find candidates.

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:10.049
This is a two-step process involving recruiting
and nominating. We've already mentioned that

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:13.360
in order to be a good candidate for office,
you generally have to have an unblemished

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:18.209
personal record - like me - or at least be
really good at heartfelt apologies. I don't

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:22.360
have an unblemished record and I'm very sorry
about that. Also, you need the ability to

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:25.750
raise money. Of course, in order to avoid
any problems with campaign financing, it's

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:29.319
helpful to have money yourself, but why spend
your own money if you can convince people

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:36.059
to give money to your campaign? Maybe print out
some hats. Merch works, merch helps raise money.

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.849
There are lots of people who want to run for
office, although there's some debate about

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:42.879
whether we're really getting the best candidates.
The pay isn't great and neither is the prestige

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:46.230
anymore, and then there's the scrutiny that
a run for office puts you and your family

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:48.939
through. Parties play an important role in
sifting through all the people who want to

00:03:48.939 --> 00:03:52.879
run and picking those who have the best chance
of winning. Nomination is the process through

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:56.980
which a potential candidate is actually chosen
to represent a particular party in an election.

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:59.920
When we talk about nominations in the US,
we're mostly talking about the presidency

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:04.010
because that's the only office that goes through
the formal nomination process. But technically

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:07.209
congressman and senators are nominated by
their parties to run as well. There are three

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:10.959
ways that a candidate for president can be
nominated. In the old days, presidential candidates

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:14.799
were nominated at a convention or caucus,
which are gatherings of party members governed

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:18.619
by rules. Conventions still occur every four
years but they're largely ceremonial these days

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:22.820
because presidential candidates are actually nominated
during the primaries. Let's go to the Thought Bubble.

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:26.760
Primary elections are held to choose candidates
who will then run in the later general election.

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:30.660
Political parties decide when and how primaries
will be held and who the candidates will be.

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:34.300
These are the elections that pit democrat
against democrat and republican against republican

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:38.400
to see who will face off in November. Primaries
can either be open or closed. Most states

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:41.860
have closed primaries, which means that only
registered voters of a particular party can

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:45.520
vote in that election. So, in a state with
closed primaries, like New York, only democrats

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:49.400
can vote in the democratic primary. And since
in many districts one party is overwhelmingly

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:53.139
dominant, the primary winner is very likely
to win the general election too. In states

00:04:53.139 --> 00:04:56.970
with open primaries, members of any party
can vote in the primary, which sounds great

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:00.940
because it encourages more participation but
it also opens up opportunities for mischief

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:04.919
*evil laughter*. For example, if there's a
strong republican candidate up against a weak

00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:08.479
republican candidate in a state with open
primaries, democrats can turn up and vote

00:05:08.479 --> 00:05:11.600
for the weak republican in the hopes that
if he wins he will have less of a chance in

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:14.530
the general election running against a democrat.
Sneaky.

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:17.789
In presidential elections, the winner of a
primary election will be assigned a certain

00:05:17.789 --> 00:05:22.120
number of party delegates. Delegates are non-elected
party members who actually nominate the candidates

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:25.490
at the convention. The delegates are usually
pledged to vote for the candidate who won

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:29.419
the primary in their state, at least on the
first ballot, and majority rules in nominating.

00:05:29.419 --> 00:05:32.940
This is why we see so much election coverage
of primaries and why some states like New

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:37.090
Hampshire try so hard to have their primaries
early. Once a candidate has sewn up enough

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:40.740
delegates, he or she becomes the nominee,
and the convention serves largely as a formality.

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:44.780
Although the primary system is more democratic
than the convention, it still has problems.

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:48.380
Even though there's more opportunity for participation,
that doesn't mean people actually participate.

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:52.150
In fact, only about 25% of those eligible
to vote in primary elections actually do,

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:55.470
and these tend to be the more ideologically
extreme members of the parties. Because to

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:58.919
them, winning elections matters most. So,
if only partisan voters show up, we tend to

00:05:58.919 --> 00:06:02.530
get uber-partisan candidates. And because
they have to win bruising primaries before

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:06.730
they even get to the general election, these
candidates tend to be aggressive and uncompromising.

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:09.900
That's good when you're competing in an election
but not so good when you're trying to work

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:14.300
with other people to craft policies or, in
very rare cases, legislation. This is why

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:17.980
many people think that primaries add to
political polarization in the US.

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:20.200
Thanks, Thought Bubble - you got my vote.

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:24.800
There's a third way that a person can become
a candidate, but it's a long and dangerous path.

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:31.400
Hey, Stan, zoom the camera in as I say that.
It's a long and dangerous path *evil laughter*.

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:35.020
A person can run as an independent
and if they get enough signatures on a petition,

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:38.410
they can become a candidate. You're more likely
to see this in congressional races but even

00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:42.620
then it's not super common. It's also really not that
long and dangerous as we implied in that last shot.

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:46.580
The third thing that parties do is mobilize
voters, also known as getting out the vote.

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:49.639
This is pretty obvious because you can't elect
a candidate if you don't get people out to

00:06:49.639 --> 00:06:54.050
vote for them - duh! Parties get out the vote
through direct mail, email and advertisements,

00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:57.270
and they can also help with voter registration
drives. The main thing the party does in terms

00:06:57.270 --> 00:07:00.639
of getting out the vote is coordinate volunteers
to help encourage voting. If you want to help

00:07:00.639 --> 00:07:04.399
on a campaign or with an election effort,
your local party office is a good place to start.

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:10.760
Another good place to start is getting out of bed.
Getting out the bed is a campaign we should have.

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:14.560
Parties also help to facilitate electoral
choice. Basically, a political party acts

00:07:14.569 --> 00:07:18.639
sort of like a brand. So, knowing which party
a candidate represents acts as a kind of shorthand

00:07:18.639 --> 00:07:23.150
for voters in the same way that seeing, say,
a Netflix logo lets you know that you're about

00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:26.069
to chill. I'm not going to go into what each
party stands for right now but let's just

00:07:26.069 --> 00:07:29.729
say that knowing that a candidate is a republican
or a democrat allows you to figure out pretty

00:07:29.729 --> 00:07:33.049
much what they stand for even if you don't
know anything about the candidate. Political

00:07:33.049 --> 00:07:37.360
parties even help non-partisan voters by narrowing
down political choices and making things easier.

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:41.129
If you want to, you can choose a candidate
by answering two relatively simple questions:

00:07:41.129 --> 00:07:45.160
which party better represents my interests and
values, and which candidate belongs to that party?

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:48.699
Finally, believe it or not, political parties
have a role in the way the national government

00:07:48.699 --> 00:07:52.199
actually works. Party membership is really
important in Congress. Parties determine who

00:07:52.199 --> 00:07:55.569
the Speaker is since he or she always comes
from the majority party and is chosen by a

00:07:55.569 --> 00:07:59.020
vote of members of that party. Parties also
determine the composition of the committees

00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:02.270
and party leaders assign members to those
committees. And parties help determine who

00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:05.669
the chairs of the committees are and they,
along with the Speaker and the majority leader

00:08:05.669 --> 00:08:09.800
in the Senate, largely shape Congress' agenda.
The president and his party have a reciprocal

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:14.819
relationship - that's the best kind of relationship
and the most fun to say. Reciprocal. The president

00:08:14.819 --> 00:08:18.289
is the leader of his party and his personal
character and popularity helps to shape the

00:08:18.289 --> 00:08:22.629
party's brand - for better or worse - and can
be used to raise money. On the other side, the party

00:08:22.629 --> 00:08:27.039
throws its support behind the president's initiatives and
helps to elect candidates that support him in Congress.

00:08:27.039 --> 00:08:30.639
So, at their most basic level, parties exist
to elect political candidates and thus gain

00:08:30.639 --> 00:08:34.120
control of the government. In order for them
to do this well, they need to provide voters

00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:38.000
with clear electoral preferences and encourage
them to act on those preferences. In a way,

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.650
this branding function - helping voters to
choose between Candidate A and Candidate B

00:08:41.650 --> 00:08:45.630
- is what parties are all about. But you're
free to disagree and if you do, go form your

00:08:45.630 --> 00:08:51.640
own party and do whatever you want. It's a
party! Woo! Thanks for watching, see you next time.
