ANNOUNCER:
<i> Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

00:00:03.402 --> 00:00:06.205
<i> the 45th and final
 President of the United States.</i>

00:00:06.238 --> 00:00:08.174
(cheers and applause)

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:13.112
Why?

00:00:13.145 --> 00:00:14.947
Thank you.

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:17.717
First, I want to comment
on the passing

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:20.319
of one of my own
personal heroes,

00:00:20.352 --> 00:00:23.222
<i> Playboy</i> founder, Hugh Hefner. 

00:00:23.255 --> 00:00:25.825
That guy was my kind
of feminist:

00:00:25.858 --> 00:00:27.794
A man who loved boobs.

00:00:27.827 --> 00:00:29.195
So much.

00:00:29.228 --> 00:00:31.798
Hef, I'll see you
in pervert heaven,

00:00:31.831 --> 00:00:35.535
which is regular-people hell.

00:00:35.568 --> 00:00:38.171
Can you tell us any more details
about your tax plan?

00:00:38.204 --> 00:00:41.474
My tax plan
is to never pay taxes.

00:00:41.507 --> 00:00:44.010
Oh, you mean the government one?

00:00:44.043 --> 00:00:45.578
No, I'm not gonna read that.

00:00:45.611 --> 00:00:47.480
Why can't your party pass a
health care bill?

00:00:47.513 --> 00:00:49.916
Because football players,

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:52.585
national anthem, kneeling.

00:00:52.618 --> 00:00:54.821
Where's the outrage?

00:00:54.854 --> 00:00:57.723
-You-you didn't answer
the question. -Excuse me.

00:00:57.756 --> 00:00:59.792
Pointing out that I didn't
answer the question

00:00:59.825 --> 00:01:04.197
is disrespectful to our flag.

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:06.933
I mean, look at her.

00:01:06.966 --> 00:01:09.435
Isn't she beautiful?

00:01:09.468 --> 00:01:12.038
So many stars.

00:01:12.071 --> 00:01:15.575
If she wasn't my flag,
I'd be dating her.

00:01:15.608 --> 00:01:19.112
And that's why tonight's theme
is flag.

00:01:19.145 --> 00:01:21.214
Isn't it hypocritical
for Jared and Ivanka

00:01:21.247 --> 00:01:23.015
to use personal e-mail
for official business

00:01:23.048 --> 00:01:26.152
