00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:12.713
In 1985, 16-year-old Douglas Casa,

00:00:12.713 --> 00:00:17.509
ran the championship 10,000 meter track race
at the Empire State Games.

00:00:17.509 --> 00:00:21.010
Suddenly, with just 200 meters to go,
he collapsed,

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:24.686
got back up and then collapsed again
on the final straightaway,

00:00:24.686 --> 00:00:27.315
with his body temperature 
at dangerous levels.

00:00:27.315 --> 00:00:29.593
He had suffered an exertional heat stroke.

00:00:29.593 --> 00:00:32.372
Fortunately, with immediate and
proper treatment,

00:00:32.372 --> 00:00:34.735
he survived the potentially fatal episode

00:00:34.735 --> 00:00:39.358
and has since helped save 167 people
in similar circumstances.

00:00:39.358 --> 00:00:41.498
From ancient soldiers on the battlefield

00:00:41.498 --> 00:00:43.802
to modern day warriors on the gridiron,

00:00:43.802 --> 00:00:48.162
exertional heat stroke, or sunstroke, 
has long been a serious concern.

00:00:48.162 --> 00:00:51.078
And unlike classical heat stroke, 
which affects vulnerable people

00:00:51.078 --> 00:00:53.685
such as infants and the elderly 
during heat waves,

00:00:53.685 --> 00:00:57.477
exertional heat stroke is caused by 
intense exercise in the heat,

00:00:57.477 --> 00:01:01.541
and is one of the top three killers
of athletes and soldiers in training.

00:01:01.541 --> 00:01:05.237
When you exercise, 
nearly 80% of the energy you use

00:01:05.237 --> 00:01:07.223
is transformed into heat.

00:01:07.223 --> 00:01:09.565
In normal circumstances, 
this is what's known as

00:01:09.565 --> 00:01:11.608
compensable heat stress.

00:01:11.608 --> 00:01:14.605
And your body can dissipate the heat
as quickly as it's generated

00:01:14.605 --> 00:01:17.442
through cooling methods 
like the evaporation of sweat.

00:01:17.442 --> 00:01:19.662
But with uncompensable heat stress,

00:01:19.662 --> 00:01:21.835
your body is unable to lose enough heat

00:01:21.835 --> 00:01:24.934
due to overexertion or 
high temperatures in humidity,

00:01:24.934 --> 00:01:28.016
which raises your core temperature 
beyond normal levels.

00:01:28.016 --> 00:01:31.136
This causes the proteins and 
cell membranes to denature,

00:01:31.136 --> 00:01:33.795
creating cells that no longer 
function properly

00:01:33.795 --> 00:01:36.083
and begin to leak their contents.

00:01:36.083 --> 00:01:38.334
If these leaky cells 
proliferate through the body,

00:01:38.334 --> 00:01:40.103
the results can be devastating.

00:01:40.103 --> 00:01:43.453
Including liver damage, 
blood clot formation in the kidneys,

00:01:43.453 --> 00:01:48.017
damage to the gastrointestinal tract 
and even the failure of vital organs.

00:01:48.017 --> 00:01:50.603
So how do you diagnose 
an exertional heat stroke?

00:01:50.603 --> 00:01:54.611
The main criterion is a core body temperature 
greater than 40 degrees Celsius

00:01:54.611 --> 00:01:57.007
observed along with physical symptoms

00:01:57.007 --> 00:02:00.370
such as increased heart rate, 
low blood pressure and rapid breathing

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:03.078
or signs of central nervous system disfunction

00:02:03.078 --> 00:02:07.409
such as confused behavior, 
aggression or loss of consciousness.

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:10.865
The most feasible and accurate way 
to assess core body temperature

00:02:10.865 --> 00:02:12.387
is with a rectal thermometer

00:02:12.387 --> 00:02:17.254
as other common temperature-taking methods
are not accurate in these circumstances.

00:02:17.254 --> 00:02:18.858
As far as treatment goes,

00:02:18.858 --> 00:02:22.901
the most important thing to remember is
cool first, transport second.

00:02:22.901 --> 00:02:27.284
Because the human body can withstand 
a core temperature above 40 degrees Celsius

00:02:27.284 --> 00:02:30.205
for about 30 minutes before cell damage sets in,

00:02:30.205 --> 00:02:33.230
it's essential to initiate rapid cooling on site

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:36.310
in order to lower it as quickly as possible.

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:39.842
After any athletic or protective gear 
has been removed from the victim,

00:02:39.842 --> 00:02:42.518
place them in an ice water tub 
while stirring the water

00:02:42.518 --> 00:02:45.132
and monitoring vitals continuously.

00:02:45.132 --> 00:02:46.755
If this is not possible,

00:02:46.755 --> 00:02:51.043
dousing in ice water and applying 
wet towels over the entire body can help.

00:02:51.043 --> 00:02:55.019
But before you start anything, 
emergency services should be called.

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:57.561
As you wait, it's important 
to keep the victim calm

00:02:57.561 --> 00:03:00.158
while cooling as much 
surface area as possible

00:03:00.158 --> 00:03:02.540
until emergency personnel arrive.

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:06.028
If medical staff are available on site,
cooling should continue

00:03:06.028 --> 00:03:10.653
until a core temperature
of 38.9 degrees Celsius is reached.

00:03:10.653 --> 00:03:12.586
The sun is known for giving life,

00:03:12.586 --> 00:03:15.220
but it can also take life away
if we're not careful,

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:17.710
even affecting the strongest among us.

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:21.944
As Dr. JJ Levick wrote of
exertional heat stroke in 1859,

00:03:21.944 --> 00:03:25.012
"It strikes down its victim 
with his full armor on.

00:03:25.012 --> 00:03:29.364
Youth, health and strength
oppose no obstacle to its power."

00:03:29.364 --> 00:03:34.193
But although this condition is one of the 
top three leading causes of death in sports,

00:03:34.193 --> 00:03:37.461
it has been 100% survivable with proper care.
