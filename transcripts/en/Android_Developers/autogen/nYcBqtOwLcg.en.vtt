00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:04.440
 Pokerers: I feel happy when I drive my bike 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:06.600
 To the unknown. 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.600
 Going away is everything. 

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:13.320
 More than 150,000 kilometers were cut 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.760
 On land or sea. 

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:17.240
 I'm not planning well. 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:19.960
 All I know is where I want to go. 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:21.960
 From there, you will 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.320
 I see what I am destined to see. 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:25.960
 I will not go anywhere else soon. 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:28.760
 My battery is down, but we're here now. 

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:31.080
 This is the spirit of adventure. 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.640
 [Rock music loud] 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:35.320
 I do not know where I will sleep. 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.000
 I do not know what I will eat, or who I will meet. 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.840
 This is the adventure for me. 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:42.080
 Boy: Where are you from? 

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:43.680
 Bookers: I'm from the Netherlands. 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.520
 If you are ready for this, you will encounter unique things. 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:49.080
 I have to look at my life in a day 

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:51.520
 I say, "My life was wonderful."
