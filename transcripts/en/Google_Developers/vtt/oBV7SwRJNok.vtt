TIMOTHY JORDAN: Hello,
I'm Timothy Jordan.

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:05.603
And this is your update about
the coolest developer news

00:00:05.603 --> 00:00:07.512
from Google in the last week.

00:00:07.512 --> 00:00:09.720
You can now apply for the
next class of the Launchpad

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:10.620
Accelerator.

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.134
The equity-free program
will begin on July 17, 2017,

00:00:14.134 --> 00:00:15.550
at the Google
Developers Launchpad

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:18.060
space in San Francisco
and will include two weeks

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:19.800
of all-expense-paid training.

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.620
We're now accepting applications
at the link in the description

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:26.590
below from several countries
in Asia, Latin America, Africa,

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:28.230
and Europe.

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.960
Android Studio 2.3
is now available.

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.390
The focus for this release
has been quality improvements

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:34.920
across the IDE.

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.600
For more details,
including screenshots

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.300
and a video introduction as
well as the link to download,

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.190
head on over to the post.

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.290
If you build Python code
that you'd like available

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.740
on the command line, this
open source tool is for you.

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:48.870
Python Fire generates
command line interfaces

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.340
from any Python code.

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.310
Simply call the Fire function
in any Python program

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:56.470
to automatically turn
that program into a CLI.

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:58.710
The GitHub link is on the post.

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.780
We've made updates to
Firebase Notifications

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.692
to help you reach your
users with greater focus.

00:01:03.692 --> 00:01:06.150
This release includes a set of
enhancements to the Firebase

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.890
Notifications console
that will allow

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.710
you to be much more granular
in selecting the audience that

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.630
receives your notification.

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.570
More details and a
screenshot are on the post.

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:19.150
Stream view and de-bug view
from Firebase Analytics

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:21.220
are being rolled out
to the general public.

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:22.930
Stream view visualizes
events as they

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:25.150
flow into Firebase
Analytics and gives you

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:27.640
a general sense of
how your users are

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:29.530
interacting with your app.

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:31.240
With de-bug view
you can immediately

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.180
see which events are being
reported to Firebase Analytics.

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:38.110
More details and some very cool
screenshots are on the post.

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:40.240
We're working on facilitating
better collaboration

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.780
between you and the Google
Cloud platform product teams

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:47.050
by upgrading to Issue Tracker,
a tool we use internally

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:48.120
at Google.

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:50.080
We've migrated
all of the issues.

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:52.570

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:54.520

and disaster recovery
provider to offer

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:03.610
a no cost self-service migration
tool for Google Cloud Platform

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:04.600
customers.

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.720
It allows you to migrate virtual
machines and physical servers

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.690
from their existing
environment into GCP

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:14.200
with near zero downtime and
little to no disruption.

webinar and get started today.

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:20.500
At the recent game
developers conference

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.510
we announced important
updates to AdMob

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:25.510
that could help you unlock new
business with rewarded video

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:29.410
formats and free unlimited and
real-time analytics reporting.

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:31.060

games more effectively
