00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.360
[upbeat intro music]

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:08.200
Hello, psych2goers!

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:11.460
We just want to take the time to thank you 
 for all your kind support.

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.300
We are a team of dedicated, passionate, and hardworking individuals

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:18.260
who come together every day with one goal in mind:

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.760
We want to make psychology come alive for you.

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:24.800
We are self-funded, and recently launched our Patreon

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.420
If you enjoy the work we do and find it meaningful,

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.680
please stick around until the end of the video

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:32.220
for more information on how to get more involved with us

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:34.920
and all the cool rewards you can get from us.

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:36.980
We hope you enjoy this video.

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.420
Childhood abuse can develop into lifelong issues

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:44.200
from insecurity to intimacy issues.

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:45.700
Depending on the severity,

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:49.640
it can also cause a person to suffer Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:50.920
(PTSD).

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:53.240
Along with mental health awareness,

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:55.380
our team also wants to take a stand

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:59.320
and educate the public about the dangerous effects of child abuse.

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:02.060
Some of the information we are about to share

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:03.460
might be triggering.

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:05.880
So we advise our viewers to be careful.

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.520
If you or someone you know is being abused,

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.340
we advise you to call your emergency hotline immediately for help.

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.020
Here are six types of child abuse.

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.160
One: Name-calling and other forms of verbal abuse.

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:23.520
While some people may argue and say that words may never hurt them,

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:25.660
words often can and do hurt,

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:27.380
especially when you're young.

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.680
Harsh words from a parent or guardian has even greater ability to hurt.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.640
One study by Johnson, Cohen, and others

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.520
suggest that verbal child abuse can increase the risk

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.160
of the victim developing personality disorders.

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.680
Research by Teicher and colleagues

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:48.000
also shows that verbal abuse can negatively alter development of the brain.

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:53.760
As a result, verbal abuse can have serious physical effects on the child.

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:56.800
Two: Shaming

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:59.560
Shaming people for something that isn't wrong

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:04.500
is an abusive behavior parents can inflict on their kids to gain control.

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.500
It causes the victim to develop insecurities

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.800
which parents can use to get what they want

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.340
if they find that their child is disobeying them.

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.220
Over time, this causes the child to lose trust in their caretaker.

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:18.040
As they grow up,

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:19.940
they may also become hesitant

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:23.220
in developing social connections with people

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.400
afraid that one day they will be betrayed or hurt.

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:30.280
Three: Extreme helicopter parenting.

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.080
Helicopter parenting is different from being a pushy parent.

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.640
Extreme helicopter parenting occurs

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.600
when parents are so overbearing

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:42.720
that children do not have any say in even minor details.

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.760
Parents who constantly check in on their child

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.400
make it difficult for the child to learn healthy boundaries.

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.560
Furthermore, if children are pushed too far emotionally or physically,

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:56.320
they can develop physical or mental scars.

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.600
Four: Sexual abuse.

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:03.460
Sexual abuse, however explicit or implicit,

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.220
can cause long-lasting harmful effects on the child.

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:10.700
The child may suffer from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder,

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.560
and can close themselves off completely,

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.020
afraid of getting into relationships.

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.840
This can cause them to fear intimacy

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:22.500
As a result, it's not just loneliness or alienation

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.700
that they will experience growing up--

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:26.980
but they will never feel safe again

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:29.240
because their caretaker took that away.

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:32.000
Five: Neglect.

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:36.260
Not providing a child with proper emotional or physical needs

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.760
can lead to many problems down the road.

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:43.640
The child may become emotionally, socially, or psychologically underdeveloped.

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:46.920
But neglect of physical and security needs,

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:48.740
such as food and proper shelter,

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:52.300
can also cause damage to the child's physical health.

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:53.900
Depending on the severity,

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:56.840
it can even result in immediate death.

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:59.260
Six: Physical abuse.

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:02.660
Physical abuse involves any harmful activity

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:04.660
that causes a person to feel pain.

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:09.120
Kicking, slapping, hitting, throwing, biting, and choking

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.240
are only a few to name.

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:16.900
The child may develop cuts, scars, bruises, broken bones, or even death,

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:18.940
depending on how badly they were beaten.

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:23.000
Never allow someone to hit you or excuse the action

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:24.660
even if they apologize.

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:29.780
Please call for help from the police before things get more out of hand.

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:33.760

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:35.840
