1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:04,380
Hey everyone. I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm
Robert Krulwich. This is radio lab,

2
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:05,190
the podcast.

3
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:09,990
Robert and I are about to go on tour
literally in a few hours to la in Seattle.

4
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:13,710
Yep. But before we do, um,
we leave you with a, um,

5
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:15,600
well why don't you set it
up? Well this is just a,

6
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:20,820
one of those crazy and wonderful
conversations that just popped into being.

7
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:21,630
Uh,

8
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:26,460
one of my favorite books of the last
couple of years was a book called the age

9
00:00:26,461 --> 00:00:26,941
of wonder.

10
00:00:26,941 --> 00:00:30,600
It was written by Richard Holmes and it
describes a particular group of people,

11
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:34,890
a bunch of people who kind of invented
modern science sort of together in the

12
00:00:34,891 --> 00:00:37,740
1780s, the 1790s in the early 18 hundreds.

13
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:40,860
A crazy and wonderful group.

14
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:46,010
Balloonists and explorers and astronomers
who believed that the world was full

15
00:00:46,711 --> 00:00:51,711
of miracles and surprising rules that
could be detected if you looked hard and

16
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:54,570
experiment an experimentation
was your thing.

17
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:01,143
Anyway,

18
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:05,670
I was talking to Mr. Holmes about his
book and move a little to the left,

19
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,950
why he wrote it and how it
all came to being a move.

20
00:01:08,951 --> 00:01:12,790
That just a bit full him down and
begin the conversation by mentioning

21
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:15,750
somebody's name. It's

22
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:22,420
Yvonne East Gullah if at least the guys
was so like what happened to you? Okay.

23
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:24,370
That's a great, great story.

24
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:28,420
It's to do with how I fell into
writing science after literature.

25
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:31,350
There are various reasons for this. Um,

26
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:35,140
I had it when I go a lot scientific
childhood, which we weren't going to now,

27
00:01:35,141 --> 00:01:36,160
but in fact as a,

28
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:40,840
as a kid I was fascinated by science
and because of the the Wade literature

29
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,300
literature. Yeah, the
education is sort of streamed.

30
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:47,050
I was taken away from that as
a kid. I could build radios,

31
00:01:47,051 --> 00:01:50,910
I could strip motorcycle engine. Actually
Modelez you were one of the things,

32
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:54,970
I was one of those and I had a wonderful
uncle in the Royal Air Force who taught

33
00:01:54,971 --> 00:01:58,270
me a lot about fight and
actually I can now set once,

34
00:01:58,271 --> 00:02:02,980
smuggle me in to a v Boma and
atomic bama. I have to say,

35
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:07,090
we didn't take over. There were
bombs. It was [inaudible]. It was,

36
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:10,520
it was one of those Big v bombers
that could carry smuggled,

37
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:12,100
doing it in a nice way as a tourist.

38
00:02:12,101 --> 00:02:15,460
Or he thought he was going to drop
you out of state. Yeah, no, he saw it.

39
00:02:15,461 --> 00:02:19,150
He thought, H, here's the kid.
Let's educate him. Say, took me in.

40
00:02:19,151 --> 00:02:22,120
He showed me how it worked.
Sat me in the copilot seat.

41
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:25,960
We were still on the ground. We was not.
Um, and then he smuggled me out again.

42
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:28,900
I've never forgotten
it. It was under a coat.

43
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:31,690
Now you just said it was
the same as on the parkway.

44
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:36,490
It was his plane after had his name on
it. He was the pilot. Okay. And he's a,

45
00:02:36,491 --> 00:02:40,870
I denied what he said to the engineer.
I would just take, take my nephew in,

46
00:02:40,871 --> 00:02:44,440
you know? Yeah. So, so I
had that last interview,

47
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:48,430
which all began to come back when I
started work on their magic scientists.

48
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,520
I also had this amazing braking. We're
getting into, everybody's got one now.

49
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:56,260
I was given what they call a visiting
fellowship at Trinity College, Cambridge.

50
00:02:56,261 --> 00:02:59,950
That's Cambridge, England. This is
Newton's college or it Barron's college.

51
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,060
It's famous for its scientists,
among other things, astrophysics,

52
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,680
particularly in mathematics.

53
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:09,670
And one you're invited
as a writer about poets.

54
00:03:09,671 --> 00:03:11,920
You've been now writing
biographies and books about side.

55
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:14,860
And I was meant to be doing
research thing on biography,

56
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:16,570
the history of bog literary biography.

57
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:20,260
And what actually happened was I found
these wonderful scientific archives,

58
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:24,730
particularly the letters of Hash
or that kept there in Cambridge.

59
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:29,410
And I started reading this. He's talking
about William and Caroline Herschel.

60
00:03:29,411 --> 00:03:34,411
This is a brother and sister team that
did build big telescopes and meet all

61
00:03:34,811 --> 00:03:39,550
kinds of fascinating discoveries about
stars and planets in those days. And uh,

62
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:41,650
and gradually I was drawn.

63
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,470
I thought this is absolutely
wonderful and there's all this,

64
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:48,670
this last side of me started
fading back plus, uh,

65
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:51,850
at trinity there's this tradition,
they talk about the high table.

66
00:03:51,851 --> 00:03:53,230
It's actually very democratic.

67
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:58,240
You go in every evening to
have a very rapid dinner,

68
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:03,220
but you sit next to whoever happens to
be there. There's no system of seating.

69
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:07,270
Okay. So this is you and all the other
teachers? This is, no, this is all the,

70
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:11,660
the senior research faculty and so
on. Okay. So these are people of imp,

71
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:16,410
Beazer Wiki people. There were
seven Nobel prize winners. Okay.

72
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:20,260
And I sat next to each of them
at various points. All right.

73
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:24,430
And as this is one of these long tables
where every plate is set that Friday and

74
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:28,540
every knife is perfectly exactly
right. Formal way form of silverware,

75
00:04:28,541 --> 00:04:29,710
jugs of water and sound.

76
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:33,130
And you talk basically the person on
your left or your right and you have to

77
00:04:33,131 --> 00:04:36,490
talk fast because they
don't, we imagine, you know,

78
00:04:36,491 --> 00:04:39,220
these don't sit around
bruising. They don't,

79
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:43,930
that I think I've really noticed the
meal would probably be over in about 25

80
00:04:43,931 --> 00:04:47,410
minutes. Amazing. Okay. And you
talked, and once you got talking,

81
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:51,950
I often never had time to finish my meal
because it was, I would sit next to,

82
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:56,190
I'd be next to an astrophysicist.
And the famous thing I, which for me,

83
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,640
this was something that
for you at this point,

84
00:04:57,641 --> 00:04:59,350
like you were just
laughing and he was, yes,

85
00:04:59,351 --> 00:05:03,040
I mean I was absolutely riveted and I
found things like scientists love to

86
00:05:03,041 --> 00:05:07,660
discuss their science. They're very
often very good at describing it,

87
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:11,590
which I loved compared with some of the
literary Don's you know God and you're

88
00:05:11,591 --> 00:05:16,480
going to literary theory and these guys
want you to understand. And I love that.

89
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:22,770
On this particular occasion I sat down
too next to a man who became clear a that

90
00:05:23,771 --> 00:05:27,730
he was Russian and he spoke
no English at all. And B,

91
00:05:27,731 --> 00:05:30,640
that he was a mathematician.
Okay. About which, you know,

92
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:32,200
which I knew very little.

93
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:36,040
I was trying to learn a bit to catch
up with the hurdles. Very, very little.

94
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:40,450
So I thought, I cannot let this pass.
There's no possibility of communication,

95
00:05:40,451 --> 00:05:44,530
but come on. The math and common
or the language. Yes. Okay.

96
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:50,250
So I think about this for a moment and
in studying beginning to tell you this

97
00:05:50,651 --> 00:05:51,484
period,

98
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:55,960
I have indeed been looking
at the mathematicians of
this period and the French

99
00:05:55,961 --> 00:05:59,150
mathematicians of this period
are where the cutting edge is.

100
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:04,310
And there's one particular thing
what the 1790 years at exactly Jim,

101
00:06:04,311 --> 00:06:06,110
particularly during the
French revolution, right.

102
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:11,030
And there's a young mathematician
whose name was ever east gala,

103
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:16,190
at least gala itself is music
to my ears. And, and he lived,

104
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:19,220
his life was a short, as a romantic poet.

105
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:24,360
He from at school, he was
at least a little, the,

106
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:27,410
I think got thrown out of almost
every institution he was in.

107
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:31,070
But he had a natural gift for
mathematics, theoretical mathematics.

108
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:35,060
And he also was
politically rather radical.

109
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:39,470
And to cut the story short in
a row, I've got the exact date,

110
00:06:39,471 --> 00:06:43,130
but maybe about roundabout age
and 20, something like that. Um,

111
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:48,190
he was writing on the theory
of mathematics number theory
in a more advanced way

112
00:06:48,501 --> 00:06:50,150
than anybody could understand.

113
00:06:50,151 --> 00:06:54,740
He sent in papers to the academy and
they were sent at the age of 19. Yes,

114
00:06:54,741 --> 00:06:59,510
19 2021 he was okay. And then he was
developing a theory which will come to,

115
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:04,310
which he got involved in. We're not
quite sure if it was a political thing,

116
00:07:04,311 --> 00:07:09,311
but it involved a deal he was challenged
to do and we think it was over a young

117
00:07:11,061 --> 00:07:12,620
woman as so many Jews are,

118
00:07:12,621 --> 00:07:17,621
if you're 1819 or 20 and he is summoned
out to have this June in the borderline

119
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:24,980
and the night before this deal he sits
down and he writes a mathematical paper.

120
00:07:24,981 --> 00:07:29,840
He puts in everything he knows into
the single paper and it's very moving.

121
00:07:29,841 --> 00:07:32,870
I've seen the manuscript, I have
some grasp of what's going on,

122
00:07:32,871 --> 00:07:36,890
but it's also that there are
lines of poetry in it that lines,

123
00:07:36,891 --> 00:07:38,330
which are clearly about this girl.

124
00:07:38,331 --> 00:07:40,370
We don't acquire what we
don't know what her name was.

125
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:43,370
And the repeated thing is I have no time.

126
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:48,020
I have no time. There is no time.

127
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:53,540
So he's cramming this all in until
dawn. It's unbelievable situation.

128
00:07:53,541 --> 00:07:56,960
This paper and the math is in there
too. And the masters in that too. Okay.

129
00:07:57,350 --> 00:08:01,150
And he, he completes the Syrian.
We'll come to this in a moment. Uh,

130
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:05,360
and then he goes out
and he shot and he dies

131
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:12,860
and this paper is left on his desk
and he's a great friend, saves it.

132
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:16,520
And it's published about, I
think about 20 years later,

133
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:21,470
the math bits or maths and the
love stuff, not the love stuff.

134
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:26,450
Um, and it's the beginning of
a stage, a mathematical theory,

135
00:08:26,451 --> 00:08:30,380
which is called groups.
Every group theory right now,

136
00:08:30,381 --> 00:08:34,420
this much I knew and very, very broadly,

137
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:38,160
here's my analogy to what groups
here is a very, very dangerous, uh,

138
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:41,260
it's to do with certain kinds
of equation. All right? That,

139
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:44,570
you know those things with an
equal sign and Ab and, yeah. Okay.

140
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,930
It involves what they call cubix.

141
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:51,440
So when something has x
to the power of three,

142
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:55,440
it's a particular form of equation,
which will, you cannot work it,

143
00:08:55,441 --> 00:08:58,470
it will not produce the result.
It will when it's square,

144
00:08:58,471 --> 00:09:02,760
but not when it's cubed or when it's,
what would it call four times in Sonic?

145
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:03,990
So it's a temperamental,

146
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:08,550
it is a temperamental equation and no
mathematics and had found a way of solving

147
00:09:08,551 --> 00:09:10,440
it at the higher power. All right,

148
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:15,870
so the analogy is it's like a box,
which when it reaches a certain size,

149
00:09:15,871 --> 00:09:20,300
you can't act in it anymore.
Okay. Now group theory will be v,

150
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:23,730
this is my fashion of it, which
I had vaguely come to understand.

151
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:25,620
It's like you kind of open that box.

152
00:09:25,621 --> 00:09:30,621
So what you do is you put that box
inside a bigger box and you can open the

153
00:09:32,311 --> 00:09:36,540
bigger box and that somehow lets
you into the little one. Oh, okay.

154
00:09:36,541 --> 00:09:39,430
I can't take you further
than that. Okay. Right.

155
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:43,860
So back to the Russian mathematician.
So I turned to him as it were,

156
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:46,020
with the soup thing still in my hand.

157
00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:51,480
And I said every gala means you just
needed to start the conversations. Right.

158
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:53,280
That's the only thing
I could think of doing.

159
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:57,140
I could just blurted out the name of a
19 year old ancient French mathematician,

160
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,520
Nutso, ancient romantic
French mathematician.

161
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:01,290
I looked him dead between the eyes.

162
00:10:01,291 --> 00:10:05,700
I said every gala and there
was a pause and to this day,

163
00:10:05,701 --> 00:10:06,534
this wonderful thing,

164
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:10,290
he looked at me and this sort
of seraphic green plastic face.

165
00:10:10,291 --> 00:10:13,260
And then he did this gesture,
which you cannot see being radio,

166
00:10:13,261 --> 00:10:14,940
which is so visual, but what it is,

167
00:10:14,941 --> 00:10:19,770
his right hand went over his heart as
if he was saluting the flag. All right.

168
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:23,850
And then both hands went out,
was in a big embracing gesture.

169
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:26,160
And what he was saying to me to start,

170
00:10:26,161 --> 00:10:30,720
it was every Skylar's so dear to
my heart and to any mathematician.

171
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:35,790
Alright. And then the big gesture
meant he invented group theory. Okay.

172
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:41,240
And then he looked at me and then the
smile got bigger and then he leaned across

173
00:10:41,341 --> 00:10:45,900
the table and he pulled in all the
Crockery, the silver water jug,

174
00:10:45,901 --> 00:10:47,460
the knife, the fort, the plates.

175
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:51,390
And he showed me group theory of what I
tried to explain to you the little box

176
00:10:51,391 --> 00:10:55,530
inside the big box in
terms of the knife spoons,

177
00:10:55,531 --> 00:10:56,470
played salts,

178
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:02,100
no words, no words. There was no way.

179
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:05,970
I knew he was talking about groups theory
and that's how he explained it to me.

180
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:10,240
So if I hear the sound first of
a hand gun. Yes, that's right.

181
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:11,920
I hear the clanking of silver. Well,

182
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:15,250
there's this wonderful gesture which can
cause, right? The broad gestures. Yes.

183
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,560
And in wonderful way.

184
00:11:16,561 --> 00:11:20,020
And it's very trinity this none
of the other dance turn her hair.

185
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:25,260
She's dragging all the crockery over and
things, you know? Yes, yes. Of course.

186
00:11:25,261 --> 00:11:26,700
You know, what else would we expect?

187
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:30,690
And there he is explaining to and giving
this model that I've tried to explain

188
00:11:30,691 --> 00:11:33,930
on air as the little box you can't
open, you put it in a bigger box.

189
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:38,290
[inaudible] position was
10 minutes long. Okay.

190
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:41,850
Well it couldn't be more than 25
because the dinners never lasted more.

191
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:46,110
I think that was one of the days
identically I ate anything from the thing.

192
00:11:46,111 --> 00:11:47,280
I think I had a glass of water.

193
00:11:47,281 --> 00:11:50,040
Maybe I had a glass of wine
probably to keep myself going.

194
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:54,970
But that whole conversation
took place wordlessly yes.

195
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:59,140
And I say that for sort
of the period of time,

196
00:11:59,141 --> 00:12:03,670
that 20 minutes I sort of understood
group's area because he somehow,

197
00:12:03,671 --> 00:12:07,120
the way he did it, I thought, Oh yes.
Okay. It's that. It's that, it's that.

198
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:09,780
And to me it was kind
of, it was a one off.

199
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:13,420
It was a sort of revelation
moment really. And I thought,

200
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:17,290
I love you science people that
you won't, nothing will stop you.

201
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:21,400
You or Jaguar going to explain
this. And also I thought, you know,

202
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:26,640
here I am sitting at one of the great
universities with this chance to learn,

203
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:30,760
okay and learn a new
field and said, this guy,

204
00:12:30,761 --> 00:12:34,780
this wonderful rush method, he's
done this to me. I am now going to,

205
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:38,050
I work at this and try and
produce, I know this is a big leap,

206
00:12:38,051 --> 00:12:38,884
but it was in my mind,

207
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:43,450
I would try and write a book that
was somehow do the same thing.

208
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:46,420
I didn't know how the hell I'm
going to do this at this time. Okay.

209
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:48,580
I don't know enough sense
some, but I'll work at it.

210
00:12:51,290 --> 00:12:55,160
And that's how he got to
right. The age of wonder,

211
00:12:55,161 --> 00:12:58,430
which was the best book of the year from
the National Academies of science and

212
00:12:58,431 --> 00:13:02,360
Engineering, whatever the other one
is. It's it and it's uh, is such a,

213
00:13:02,930 --> 00:13:06,740
Oh man. I mean, it was kind of an
adventure story. It's an adventure. Great.

214
00:13:06,741 --> 00:13:10,760
Yeah. Anyways, so that's Richard Holmes,
and I guess that's the vodcast. Uh,

215
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:14,540
I'm Jad Abumrad and I'm Roberta
quilvent. Thanks for listening.
