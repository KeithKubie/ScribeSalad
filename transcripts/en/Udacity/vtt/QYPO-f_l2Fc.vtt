00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:04.489
Let's think back to the leftover
pizza from the big pizza party again.

00:00:04.489 --> 00:00:07.034
Remember, I was choosing between
three-eights of a pizza and

00:00:07.034 --> 00:00:08.600
five-sixteenths of a pizza.

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:12.980
What if I took both
sets of leftovers home?

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:15.996
What is three-eights + five-sixteenths?

00:00:15.996 --> 00:00:17.472
Is it eight-eights?

00:00:17.472 --> 00:00:18.809
Eight-sixteenth?

00:00:18.809 --> 00:00:20.564
Eight-twenty fourths?

00:00:20.564 --> 00:00:22.570
Or is it something else?
