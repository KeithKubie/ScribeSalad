MICHAEL BOLOGNINO:
Well, hello everybody.

00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:02.200
Thank you for coming.

00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:03.741
Thank you for those
of you who aren't

00:00:03.741 --> 00:00:06.050
in the room that are tuned in.

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:07.970
It's a particularly
exciting day today.

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:09.710
We have Janet Mock here with us.

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:11.460
And for those of you
who don't know Janet,

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.230
she is a New York Times
best selling author.

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:16.079
She is a trans advocate.

00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:17.910
She is a GLAAD Award nominee.

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.260
The list goes on and on.

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.340
And we'll learn a lot more
about her as this goes on today.

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.020
So Janet, welcome.

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:26.320
Thank you very much for coming.

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:27.550
JANET MOCK: Thank
you for having me.

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:28.675
MICHAEL BOLOGNINO: Totally.

00:00:28.675 --> 00:00:31.132
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:31.132 --> 00:00:32.590
MICHAEL BOLOGNINO:
OK, so I thought

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:36.116
it would be fun to start with
some rapid fire questions.

00:00:36.116 --> 00:00:37.740
JANET MOCK: Did you
introduce yourself?

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:38.823
MICHAEL BOLOGNINO: Oh, no.

00:00:38.823 --> 00:00:39.548
I didn't.

00:00:39.548 --> 00:00:40.514
OK, I will.

00:00:40.514 --> 00:00:41.430
I'm Michael Bolognino.

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:42.540
I work at Google.

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.186
I do marketing for Google
Docs and thank you.

00:00:45.186 --> 00:00:46.310
JANET MOCK: Yes, of course.

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:47.518
MICHAEL BOLOGNINO: All right.

00:00:47.518 --> 00:00:49.590
Now that that's out of the way.

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.569
Your favorite New
York City season?

00:00:52.569 --> 00:00:53.360
JANET MOCK: Spring.

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:54.310
MICHAEL BOLOGNINO: OK.

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:56.337
The fashion trend
that you hope is dead.

00:00:56.337 --> 00:00:57.420
JANET MOCK: Fashion trend?

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:58.271
Uggs.

00:00:58.271 --> 00:00:59.270
MICHAEL BOLOGNINO: Yeah.

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:03.270
The favorite place that
you've been on vacation.

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.190
JANET MOCK: It has to
be going home to Hawaii.

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:06.106
MICHAEL BOLOGNINO: OK.

00:01:06.106 --> 00:01:07.960
And the last place
you went on vacation?

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:08.834
JANET MOCK: Sarasota.

00:01:08.834 --> 00:01:10.080
MICHAEL BOLOGNINO: All right.

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.922
Dogs or cats, or other?

00:01:11.922 --> 00:01:12.630
JANET MOCK: Dogs.

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.424
MICHAEL BOLOGNINO: OK The
golden girl you most relate to?

00:01:15.424 --> 00:01:16.340
JANET MOCK: Oh my god.

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.840
Sophia.

00:01:19.504 --> 00:01:20.920
MICHAEL BOLOGNINO:
A living person

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.170
that you haven't met,
that you dream to meet?

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:25.550
JANET MOCK: Hmm.

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:26.290
Toni Morrison.

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:27.500
MICHAEL BOLOGNINO: OK.

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.490
Do you have a current
TV show addiction?

00:01:32.905 --> 00:01:34.280
JANET MOCK: Oh my
god, I'm trying

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.460
to figure out which ones-- I
just finished "True Detective,"

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:39.850
but I'm not obsessed with it.

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:42.570
But I think one of
those, like "Revenge,"

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.690
which is kind of a
bizarre obsession,

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:46.755
because it's like so
bad, but it's so good.

00:01:46.755 --> 00:01:47.300
MICHAEL BOLOGNINO: Totally.

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:48.174
JANET MOCK: You know?

00:01:48.174 --> 00:01:49.365
MICHAEL BOLOGNINO: Yes.

00:01:49.365 --> 00:01:51.400
OK.

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:53.071
Aretha Franklin
or Patti Labelle?

00:01:53.071 --> 00:01:53.820
JANET MOCK: Patti.

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:54.902
MICHAEL BOLOGNINO: OK.

00:01:54.902 --> 00:01:56.110
JANET MOCK: I saw that shade.

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:58.190
MICHAEL BOLOGNINO:
Yeah that's what--

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:59.020
JANET MOCK: That
she threw at her.

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:00.294
She was like, I'm not
touching your hand.

00:02:00.294 --> 00:02:01.900
MICHAEL BOLOGNINO: So you're
on the side with Patti's team?

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:02.566
JANET MOCK: Yes.

00:02:02.566 --> 00:02:03.660
MICHAEL BOLOGNINO: OK, OK.

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:07.260
And for breakfast,
sweet or savory?

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:08.009
JANET MOCK: Sweet.

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:08.360
MICHAEL BOLOGNINO: OK.

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.139
And then your favorite
Janet Jackson album

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:13.274
that is not "The Velvet Rope."

00:02:13.274 --> 00:02:14.190
JANET MOCK: "Control."

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:15.290
MICHAEL BOLOGNINO: OK.

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:16.240
Excellent.

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:23.540
All right, now that that's out
of the way, let's talk about,

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:25.640
well things are super
exciting for you right now.

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.750
So before we talk about the
book itself, you've been,

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:31.090
obviously the New York Times
best seller just happened.

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:32.345
That's huge.

00:02:32.345 --> 00:02:34.720
Personally, it was just your
birthday, so happy birthday.

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.020
JANET MOCK: Thank you.

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:38.070
MICHAEL BOLOGNINO: The
book's doing amazing.

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:39.790
What do you think
is the highlight

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:42.610
in the last few months
for you personally?

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:45.180
JANET MOCK: I think it's meeting
people around the country,

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.660
and kind of sharing
space and stories,

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:50.030
and intimacies with strangers.

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:52.220
Because I think that the
bizarre thing about writing

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:55.580
in a genre like memoir,
is that everyone

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:57.495
knows so much about
you, but you know

00:02:57.495 --> 00:03:00.430
no one, nothing
about someone else.

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:03.280
And so I think that
there's this, especially

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.000
with just the platform
of books period,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.850
there's such intimacy there.

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:10.100
You have to really engage with
it for long periods of time,

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:11.100
right?

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:13.700
It's not like an article
that you can skim real quick,

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:16.158
and kind of read the headline,
and maybe read the first two

00:03:16.158 --> 00:03:18.066
paragraphs, and be
like, I really got that.

00:03:18.066 --> 00:03:19.940
A book, you have to
really sit there with it,

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:20.970
and share space with it.

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:26.050
And I think a book as open as
mine is in terms of intimacy,

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:28.430
it builds this-- it's real.

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:29.990
It's an authentic
sense of intimacy.

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:31.950
But when you're sharing
space with people,

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:33.575
and you don't know
anything about them,

00:03:33.575 --> 00:03:35.390
and they know so much
about you that they

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:37.270
can remember your best
friend from childhood,

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:39.880
and you're just like, OK.

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:41.840
And so hearing people
come back to me

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:44.890
and telling me about themselves,
writing letters to me,

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:48.600
telling me the points of
intersection, of resonance,

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:51.620
in the book with them
that struck them,

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:54.920
that's been the most
valuable, I think,

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:58.727
interactions and exchanges
post writing the book.

00:03:58.727 --> 00:04:00.810
MICHAEL BOLOGNINO: I'm
sure there's a ton of that.

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:03.030
I mean, I know just sitting with
you earlier, we were already

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:05.113
hearing from lots of people
since we've been here.

00:04:05.113 --> 00:04:07.930
So it's pretty incredible.

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:11.020
So let's talk about now the
process of writing the book.

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:13.430
So how did it start?

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:16.135
Are you a journaler,
what's your process?

00:04:16.135 --> 00:04:18.260
JANET MOCK: It definitely
started through journals.

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.790
I think before it was
"Redefining Realness,"

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:23.290
it was just kind of
my daily thoughts

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:26.677
about stories from
my life and memories.

00:04:26.677 --> 00:04:28.510
And so they weren't
really even stories yet.

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:30.030
The were just
fragments of memories

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:33.650
that I knew that I wanted
to like have a record of.

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:36.760
And so they were also informed
by my daily interactions

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:41.120
with self, meaning this is
before I stepped forward

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:43.260
in Marie Claire,
which I did in 2011,

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.340
and kind of tool
part of my story.

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:47.660
And so sitting
there telling myself

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:52.470
my own stories was a
way for me to, I guess,

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:54.890
strengthen myself a
little bit, and get ready

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:56.470
for public
consumption that comes

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:59.490
from the public space
of being visible.

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:02.462
And so it very much started
from daily journals.

00:05:02.462 --> 00:05:03.920
At the time I was
reading something

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:05.480
called "The Artist's Way."

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:07.735
So I don't know if anyone
knows Julia Cameron's book,

00:05:07.735 --> 00:05:10.400
but I was doing morning
pages faithfully.

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:13.280
And I was single at time, so
I had lots of time to myself.

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:16.060
So girl was navel
gazing for days.

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:18.580
And so it was very
much from that process.

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:21.450
And then it grew to not only
wanting to write my story,

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:23.750
but then talking to
people in my life.

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:25.430
My boyfriend who
came into my life

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:28.740
at the time, my best
friend, opening up to her.

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:30.520
Then the next level
was Marie Claire,

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:34.795
and then it was also
politicizing my experiences.

00:05:34.795 --> 00:05:37.170
Well, contextualizing them
through a political and social

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:40.320
landscape, and really
making it more than just me.

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:42.210
So this memoir is
very much birthed out

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:45.690
of my process over the
last four or five years.

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:47.610
And then it finally
came forward.

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:49.693
MICHAEL BOLOGNINO: OK, now
that makes total sense.

00:05:49.693 --> 00:05:51.530
And I think that for
me, reading the book,

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:54.170
the people that I encountered
were such a huge part

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:55.670
of the story, like
you said earlier.

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:58.440
And I remember you mentioning,
I think in the introduction

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:01.100
perhaps, that you
talked to a lot of them

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:03.250
before the book came out.

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:07.630
And so what is that like to have
a conversation with someone?

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:10.181
You deal with a lot of
challenging relationships

00:06:10.181 --> 00:06:10.680
in the book.

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:15.980
So how does that-- was it
particularly hard for you

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:17.850
to talk about them in the book?

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:21.300
Just help us understand that
process of publicly telling

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:23.360
your story that
involves someone else.

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:27.440
JANET MOCK: I think for me,
my parents were fair game.

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:30.400
Because I did not
get to choose them,

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:32.610
so I felt like it
was a completely fair

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:36.110
for me to write very
openly about their lives

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:37.810
and their interactions with me.

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:40.530
My siblings felt a
little more shaky for me.

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:43.860
And so I think I felt the
most obligation, probably

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:46.490
to my brother Chad,
because he spent so much,

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:48.410
we were only a year
and 13 days apart,

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:50.470
so we were born very closely.

00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:53.350
Our birthdays were always
celebrated very closely.

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:55.940
And so I felt the most
obligation and sensitivity

00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:57.920
towards him.

00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:00.399
And so that was a tricky
thing for me to navigate.

00:07:00.399 --> 00:07:02.440
So that's why I think that
I spent a lot of time.

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:03.950
If I was going to write
about someone a lot,

00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:06.310
I made sure that I had their
voice in the book a lot.

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:07.435
So I interviewed my mother.

00:07:07.435 --> 00:07:08.750
I interviewed my father.

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:12.010
I interviewed my brother Chad,
and interviewed my best friend

00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:12.540
Wendy.

00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:14.450
And so those were the
four people that I felt

00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:18.226
were very pivotal
characters in the book.

00:07:18.226 --> 00:07:19.600
But it's weird to
say characters,

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:20.570
because they're actual people.

00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:21.270
MICHAEL BOLOGNINO:
Right, totally.

00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:23.490
JANET MOCK: But for the
reader, it's a character,

00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:25.290
because they don't
really know this person.

00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:27.780
They know this person through
my lens, and experience,

00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:29.500
and interactions with them.

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:36.960
And so yeah, the process of
writing about people, people

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:39.660
you love and care about,
is also a difficult thing.

00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:42.130
But I think the one thing I
learned with memoir that it's

00:07:42.130 --> 00:07:45.460
not so much a space
for venting or revenge.

00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:50.390
It's a space to really look
at everyone in your life,

00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:53.110
even yourself, with
the same brutal honesty

00:07:53.110 --> 00:07:55.320
and sharp criticism
that you look

00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:56.580
at, quote unquote, villains.

00:07:56.580 --> 00:07:59.490
And so in this book, there's
no antagonists to me.

00:07:59.490 --> 00:08:02.010
I think that everyone's a
full person in this book.

00:08:02.010 --> 00:08:04.700
And I think that when you
communicate that kind of nuance

00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:07.160
and complexity, it gives
a more true experience.

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:10.680
Like my parents,
my parents, if you

00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:14.290
read "Redefining Realness,"
my parents for super messy,

00:08:14.290 --> 00:08:16.270
and ill equipped, and
battled a drug addiction

00:08:16.270 --> 00:08:18.220
and abusive relationship.

00:08:18.220 --> 00:08:22.740
And both had tons of children
that they didn't really

00:08:22.740 --> 00:08:25.360
have the resources
to take care of,

00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:28.560
but I had to really look at how
they grew up, in the same sense

00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:30.900
that I have to give
sensitivity to how I grew up.

00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:33.900
And so when I can look at
my parents as more than just

00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:37.390
these people who were my
mother and father, but as

00:08:37.390 --> 00:08:39.350
their own people who
had their own struggles,

00:08:39.350 --> 00:08:41.482
and failed expectations,
and heart breaks,

00:08:41.482 --> 00:08:42.940
I could paint a
more full portrait.

00:08:42.940 --> 00:08:47.000
And so I hoped to do that
with each character or person

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:48.670
in the book, in
which I wrote about.

00:08:48.670 --> 00:08:50.170
MICHAEL BOLOGNINO:
I definitely felt

00:08:50.170 --> 00:08:52.130
like I got to know
them very well.

00:08:52.130 --> 00:08:55.270
And that was one of the favorite
parts, for me, of the book.

00:08:55.270 --> 00:08:58.960
So after it came out,
had your relationships,

00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:01.930
have you sat down and
talked about the content

00:09:01.930 --> 00:09:02.930
about particular people.

00:09:02.930 --> 00:09:06.140
And how is that shaped,
has it strengthened or hurt

00:09:06.140 --> 00:09:08.010
any of your relationships?

00:09:08.010 --> 00:09:08.990
JANET MOCK: Wow.

00:09:08.990 --> 00:09:13.490
I think that's the bizarre
part, is that my parents were

00:09:13.490 --> 00:09:16.690
learning about me as the
world was learning about me.

00:09:16.690 --> 00:09:20.110
Because I had never been
so open with them about it.

00:09:20.110 --> 00:09:25.480
They're learning about their
child talking about sexuality,

00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:27.400
talking about creating
a space for the erotic,

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:30.890
talking about what she was
doing with her body and the pain

00:09:30.890 --> 00:09:34.310
that they caused
upon her, being me.

00:09:34.310 --> 00:09:37.040
It was a memoir, so still have
a hard time with "I" statements.

00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:38.590
So it's really bizarre.

00:09:38.590 --> 00:09:43.320
So I think or my parents,
it was this weird sense of,

00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:44.960
I'm really fascinated
by this story,

00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:47.322
but this story is
like about my child.

00:09:47.322 --> 00:09:48.780
And so I think
that's a weird space

00:09:48.780 --> 00:09:52.770
to be in as a reader,
someone that's so invested.

00:09:52.770 --> 00:09:56.050
The first person that
read the book in process

00:09:56.050 --> 00:09:57.750
was my boyfriend Aaron.

00:09:57.750 --> 00:10:02.202
And he was like, wow,
you really told it all.

00:10:02.202 --> 00:10:03.660
And I think that
he also felt there

00:10:03.660 --> 00:10:07.840
was this weird sense of Prince
Charming-esque abilities

00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:08.860
that I threw onto him.

00:10:08.860 --> 00:10:11.200
And he was like, this isn't
like necessarily true,

00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:12.794
but I can see, you know?

00:10:12.794 --> 00:10:15.820
For him, it's not how
he sees himself, right?

00:10:15.820 --> 00:10:17.940
And so I think there's
this weird-- for him,

00:10:17.940 --> 00:10:19.770
that's what he took
away from the book.

00:10:19.770 --> 00:10:22.470
But he was like, oh wow, it
was really interesting to see

00:10:22.470 --> 00:10:24.350
someone I love so
much, their full story

00:10:24.350 --> 00:10:25.600
through their own perspective.

00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:28.600
And I think it was the same
kind of thread with my parents.

00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:32.130
Like I finally had a real depth
conversation with my father

00:10:32.130 --> 00:10:34.449
three nights ago about the book.

00:10:34.449 --> 00:10:35.990
I think it was very
difficult for him

00:10:35.990 --> 00:10:39.060
to get through the book, because
so much of the first half of it

00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:41.340
is about his struggles.

00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:44.880
And I was writing about it from
my perspective as a six, seven,

00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:47.570
eight, nine-year-old,
10-year-old.

00:10:47.570 --> 00:10:49.870
And also his gender
policing of me as a child.

00:10:49.870 --> 00:10:52.120
MICHAEL BOLOGNINO: Let's
talk about that for a minute.

00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:55.200
One of the elements
the book that I thought

00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:58.940
was particularly intense,
or had to be hard for you,

00:10:58.940 --> 00:11:03.592
was when he discovered your,
I guess, alter ego, Keisha.

00:11:03.592 --> 00:11:05.550
And for those of you who
haven't read the book,

00:11:05.550 --> 00:11:06.710
maybe you want to explain--

00:11:06.710 --> 00:11:07.130
JANET MOCK: Yeah.

00:11:07.130 --> 00:11:08.670
MICHAEL BOLOGNINO: OK, who
Keisha was, and then I'll

00:11:08.670 --> 00:11:10.220
explain what
happened after that.

00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:13.910
JANET MOCK: So Keisha was,
I invented her, I think,

00:11:13.910 --> 00:11:15.730
when I was 10 years old.

00:11:15.730 --> 00:11:17.930
So my father had many
different girlfriends

00:11:17.930 --> 00:11:19.270
and they all had children.

00:11:19.270 --> 00:11:22.410
And so this one apartment
that we settled in, there's

00:11:22.410 --> 00:11:25.060
a teenage girl, she was about
15, and I was about, I think,

00:11:25.060 --> 00:11:26.250
nine or 10.

00:11:26.250 --> 00:11:28.970
And she would always talk
to boys on the phone.

00:11:28.970 --> 00:11:32.530
And so she would use me to
tell them that she's not home,

00:11:32.530 --> 00:11:33.295
to lie to them.

00:11:33.295 --> 00:11:35.170
And so one day when she
actually wasn't home,

00:11:35.170 --> 00:11:37.336
and there was this boy that
she was trying to avoid,

00:11:37.336 --> 00:11:39.650
I was like like, oh, you
know, Mikaela's not here,

00:11:39.650 --> 00:11:44.590
but this is Keisha, and
Mikaela told me to talk to you.

00:11:44.590 --> 00:11:47.190
And so I was just kind of
telling these tall tales,

00:11:47.190 --> 00:11:50.700
and fantasies, and stories of
my would be life as a girl.

00:11:50.700 --> 00:11:54.980
Because I was perceived to be
a boy throughout my childhood.

00:11:54.980 --> 00:11:58.630
And so at the time, being
this very feminine child who

00:11:58.630 --> 00:12:01.110
didn't yet know
that she was trans,

00:12:01.110 --> 00:12:05.487
I expressed my girlhood through
this character of Keisha,

00:12:05.487 --> 00:12:07.570
which fell closer to me
than myself, even though I

00:12:07.570 --> 00:12:09.940
knew that it was
very much a role.

00:12:09.940 --> 00:12:11.770
And so Keisha
began on the phone,

00:12:11.770 --> 00:12:15.250
and then Keisha went into real
life during my spring break

00:12:15.250 --> 00:12:20.030
of like 1994, 1993 it was.

00:12:20.030 --> 00:12:21.900
I just remember
"What A Man" was on.

00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:24.930
And I really wanted to memorize
Salt 'N Pepa's "What A Man,"

00:12:24.930 --> 00:12:26.570
which I did, by the way.

00:12:26.570 --> 00:12:30.058
And I will not sing
any of it here.

00:12:30.058 --> 00:12:31.932
MICHAEL BOLOGNINO: What
if we do it together?

00:12:31.932 --> 00:12:32.918
JANET MOCK: No.

00:12:32.918 --> 00:12:35.390
MICHAEL BOLOGNINO: OK.

00:12:35.390 --> 00:12:39.571
JANET MOCK: So that's
a side note, tangent.

00:12:39.571 --> 00:12:41.320
So I brought Keisha
out to the real world.

00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:45.370
And my little cousin, Michelle,
who was like two years

00:12:45.370 --> 00:12:49.140
younger than me, we went
out and I developed a crush

00:12:49.140 --> 00:12:50.990
on a boy who really liked me.

00:12:50.990 --> 00:12:53.992
And I had long curly
hair at the time.

00:12:53.992 --> 00:12:55.450
And so, I was like,
oh, I'm Keisha.

00:12:55.450 --> 00:12:58.120
We had this little
flirtation, very innocent.

00:12:58.120 --> 00:13:00.330
And then one day, when my
father was picking me up

00:13:00.330 --> 00:13:05.000
on the last day of spring
break, the boy, Jamie, knocks

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.461
on the door and
says, is Keisha here?

00:13:07.461 --> 00:13:08.960
And then it creates
this whole thing

00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:10.490
that you have to see play out.

00:13:10.490 --> 00:13:11.615
MICHAEL BOLOGNINO: Totally.

00:13:11.615 --> 00:13:14.500
Well, my heart was racing with
yours when I read that part.

00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:18.210
And so then what happens
next, essentially,

00:13:18.210 --> 00:13:20.550
is that your dad
shaves your head.

00:13:20.550 --> 00:13:26.660
And I think hair, to me,
seems like it represented

00:13:26.660 --> 00:13:29.510
a way that you could
express yourself at a time

00:13:29.510 --> 00:13:32.459
when you weren't quite sure how,
or what was OK or comfortable,

00:13:32.459 --> 00:13:33.750
and it was very natural to you.

00:13:36.870 --> 00:13:37.820
How did it feel?

00:13:37.820 --> 00:13:39.960
And I imagine that
it really felt

00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:43.690
like it stripped you
of that identity.

00:13:43.690 --> 00:13:45.780
And then I know the
process of going back,

00:13:45.780 --> 00:13:50.270
and the Gumby, someone called
you Gumby, or something?

00:13:50.270 --> 00:13:52.080
Just tell me about that.

00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:54.499
So what was your experience
after that with your dad?

00:13:54.499 --> 00:13:57.040
JANET MOCK: So I think it was
the first time my father really

00:13:57.040 --> 00:13:58.200
truly saw me.

00:13:58.200 --> 00:14:01.420
I think he saw me before, but
it was easy for him to deny it,

00:14:01.420 --> 00:14:03.790
because other people
didn't recognize or see.

00:14:03.790 --> 00:14:07.970
So having this boy walk up
into his sister's space,

00:14:07.970 --> 00:14:12.420
and to say, I'm looking for
Keisha, this girl, my father,

00:14:12.420 --> 00:14:14.150
he needed to correct that.

00:14:14.150 --> 00:14:18.830
And so for him, he, as you just
explained, he shaved my head.

00:14:18.830 --> 00:14:23.910
And that was my only sense
of a physical embodiment

00:14:23.910 --> 00:14:26.950
of my girlhood at the
time, of my true identity

00:14:26.950 --> 00:14:28.574
as how I knew myself.

00:14:28.574 --> 00:14:31.240
And so my father, doing that, he
thought that he was erasing it.

00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:33.480
But hair does grow
back, even though it

00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:35.030
was very traumatic at the time.

00:14:35.030 --> 00:14:38.200
And I had to really go through
it for a year and a half.

00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:40.880
And I think that is was
just this moment where

00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:44.690
he was very confused, and he was
battling himself, and battling

00:14:44.690 --> 00:14:48.580
his own ideas of what gender is,
and what his role as a father

00:14:48.580 --> 00:14:52.022
was, to raise this child
that he saw as his son that

00:14:52.022 --> 00:14:53.980
was his namesake, and
all these kind of things.

00:14:53.980 --> 00:14:58.050
And so I think
that it is symbolic

00:14:58.050 --> 00:15:00.424
of a lot of our
interactions growing up.

00:15:00.424 --> 00:15:02.090
And you see there's
these little moments

00:15:02.090 --> 00:15:05.730
and he even threatens me, years
before that, he'll cut my hair.

00:15:05.730 --> 00:15:07.430
It was always the big threat.

00:15:07.430 --> 00:15:10.930
And so when he actually
followed through on that,

00:15:10.930 --> 00:15:14.240
I think it was a major
pivot in our relationship.

00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:16.800
And I think it's great
that a year and a half

00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:19.200
later, I basically move
with my mother to Hawaii,

00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:21.630
and it's a completely
different environment.

00:15:21.630 --> 00:15:24.280
MICHAEL BOLOGNINO: Right, OK.

00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:27.100
JANET MOCK: It also shows also
the agency of young people,

00:15:27.100 --> 00:15:29.210
the lack of agency
often in most homes,

00:15:29.210 --> 00:15:32.920
where you don't have control
over having the resources

00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:34.460
and funds to buy
your own clothes,

00:15:34.460 --> 00:15:38.410
to say that you want to do what
you want and express yourself

00:15:38.410 --> 00:15:42.020
in dress, in hair, in makeup
or adornments in any way.

00:15:42.020 --> 00:15:43.490
And so a lot of
times your parents

00:15:43.490 --> 00:15:46.500
are very much, at least in the
households that I grew up in,

00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:50.910
it was very much, we
have $150 allotted to you

00:15:50.910 --> 00:15:52.410
at the beginning
of the school year.

00:15:52.410 --> 00:15:55.310
And we're not giving you $150,
we're going with you to shop.

00:15:55.310 --> 00:15:58.089
And so for me was
always this pained time.

00:15:58.089 --> 00:16:00.630
It was like, oh shit, I have to
wear all these damn JC Penney

00:16:00.630 --> 00:16:04.277
polos, and all this
stuff, cargo shorts.

00:16:04.277 --> 00:16:05.693
And it's like, oh
lord, and I have

00:16:05.693 --> 00:16:09.380
to wear the stuff, because I
have no agency to say that, no,

00:16:09.380 --> 00:16:11.930
and even no voice really to say
that I don't feel comfortable

00:16:11.930 --> 00:16:12.940
in these clothes.

00:16:12.940 --> 00:16:14.930
And this is not
what I want to wear,

00:16:14.930 --> 00:16:17.290
and I didn't feel that
safety in both of my homes

00:16:17.290 --> 00:16:20.609
to do that until I was maybe
like 13 or 14 years old.

00:16:20.609 --> 00:16:21.650
MICHAEL BOLOGNINO: Right.

00:16:21.650 --> 00:16:23.940
Well, I guess that's
almost near the point

00:16:23.940 --> 00:16:25.065
where you met Wendy, right?

00:16:25.065 --> 00:16:26.240
JANET MOCK: Mmm hmm.

00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:29.000
MICHAEL BOLOGNINO: And I think
you guys together found ways

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.840
to grab that agency, and started
buying the clothes that you

00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:32.720
wanted to buy, right?

00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:35.130
And so tell us a little
bit about that inflection

00:16:35.130 --> 00:16:36.920
point in your life.

00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:39.250
JANET MOCK: Yeah,
that relationship, I

00:16:39.250 --> 00:16:41.550
think it's one of those
things where some people just

00:16:41.550 --> 00:16:43.091
come into your life
at certain times.

00:16:43.091 --> 00:16:44.570
You don't know why.

00:16:44.570 --> 00:16:47.570
And so Wendy was just
someone who really saw me.

00:16:47.570 --> 00:16:49.960
MICHAEL BOLOGNINO: She saw
you first at school, right?

00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:51.080
JANET MOCK: Yes, she
saw me at school.

00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:52.760
I was picking up my
brother from school.

00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:54.426
We were waiting for
my mom to pick us up

00:16:54.426 --> 00:16:56.960
from the little playground
that's between our two schools.

00:16:56.960 --> 00:16:58.710
I was middle school, I
was in the seventh grade.

00:16:58.710 --> 00:17:00.443
And my brother Jeffrey
was six years younger,

00:17:00.443 --> 00:17:01.710
so he was in the first grade.

00:17:01.710 --> 00:17:04.085
And he was just playing, and
I was sitting on the swings.

00:17:04.085 --> 00:17:08.750
And Wendy was walking by with
her green bob and her high,

00:17:08.750 --> 00:17:11.550
her super short shorts,
soccer shorts rolled up,

00:17:11.550 --> 00:17:14.159
and her knee high socks.

00:17:14.159 --> 00:17:15.950
And she just passed by
with her volleyball,

00:17:15.950 --> 00:17:19.319
and she was like,
Mary, are you mahu?

00:17:19.319 --> 00:17:22.750
And I was just like,
I didn't say anything,

00:17:22.750 --> 00:17:26.200
because I wasn't ready for
that sense of reflection

00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:29.030
and recognition, like
she really saw me.

00:17:29.030 --> 00:17:31.670
And mahu is, I was in
Honolulu at the time,

00:17:31.670 --> 00:17:35.100
so mahu is this--
it's kind of a term,

00:17:35.100 --> 00:17:37.260
it's like a third
space for gender

00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:39.950
beyond the gender binary,
beyond male and female.

00:17:39.950 --> 00:17:42.170
There's a space to
explore the spectrum.

00:17:42.170 --> 00:17:44.700
But it mostly was
applied loosely,

00:17:44.700 --> 00:17:48.100
if you bring the Western
colonized sense of what mahu

00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:50.470
is, it's loosely
termed as transgender.

00:17:50.470 --> 00:17:52.300
But that's not
really what it is,

00:17:52.300 --> 00:17:54.380
but it's kind of a space
outside of male-female.

00:17:54.380 --> 00:17:57.840
And it's oftentimes
for children that

00:17:57.840 --> 00:18:00.481
are assigned male
at birth, based

00:18:00.481 --> 00:18:01.980
on the appearance
of their genitals,

00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:04.450
and who are feminine presenting.

00:18:04.450 --> 00:18:06.520
And so when Wendy saw
me, that's what she saw,

00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:09.040
even though I was wearing
these polos from JC Penney.

00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:09.400
MICHAEL BOLOGNINO:
She clocked you.

00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:11.191
JANET MOCK: Yeah, she
basically clocked me.

00:18:11.191 --> 00:18:11.920
She spooked me.

00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:15.330
She was like, girl, I see you.

00:18:15.330 --> 00:18:17.020
Why are you trying to pretend?

00:18:17.020 --> 00:18:18.470
And I just ignored her.

00:18:18.470 --> 00:18:19.956
And so I was not
ready for her yet.

00:18:19.956 --> 00:18:20.997
MICHAEL BOLOGNINO: Right.

00:18:20.997 --> 00:18:22.320
And here she is, so visible.

00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:22.590
JANET MOCK: Yes.

00:18:22.590 --> 00:18:23.220
MICHAEL BOLOGNINO: So green.

00:18:23.220 --> 00:18:25.100
JANET MOCK: Yes, and
looking for friends,

00:18:25.100 --> 00:18:26.920
and looking for like,
girl, I see you,

00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:28.590
I'm going to come
follow up later on.

00:18:28.590 --> 00:18:29.680
And she did.

00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:31.471
MICHAEL BOLOGNINO: So
when she followed up,

00:18:31.471 --> 00:18:33.490
what did you ready
to talk to her?

00:18:33.490 --> 00:18:38.240
JANET MOCK: I think growing
up in a home where I always

00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:41.140
had this dream
image of my mother,

00:18:41.140 --> 00:18:43.680
you have to really break
down the family chronology.

00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:44.730
My parents met.

00:18:44.730 --> 00:18:46.939
A year later, they got
married, and had me.

00:18:46.939 --> 00:18:49.355
And they already had children
from previous relationships.

00:18:49.355 --> 00:18:52.390
And they were fairly young,
they were 23 years old.

00:18:52.390 --> 00:18:54.800
And my mother already
had two girls before.

00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:58.300
And my father had three
children from high school.

00:18:58.300 --> 00:18:59.720
Messy.

00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:02.680
And so then I come along, the
embodiment of what they believe

00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:04.220
is going to be
their life together,

00:19:04.220 --> 00:19:06.467
their first marriages.

00:19:06.467 --> 00:19:08.300
They're going to fulfill
the American dream.

00:19:08.300 --> 00:19:10.420
And he was a Navy
officer, and she

00:19:10.420 --> 00:19:13.100
was this woman who
worked in Honolulu,

00:19:13.100 --> 00:19:15.160
and he's this black
man from Dallas, Texas.

00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:16.400
And they meet.

00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:19.120
That does not work out, because
of my father's philandering

00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:22.430
ways and my mother's just too
high expectations from someone

00:19:22.430 --> 00:19:24.574
that she's not fully seeing.

00:19:24.574 --> 00:19:26.490
And the so they break
up when I'm about three.

00:19:26.490 --> 00:19:29.920
Me and my brother go and
live with my parents,

00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:31.486
live with my mother in Honolulu.

00:19:31.486 --> 00:19:33.110
We stay with her for
a couple of years,

00:19:33.110 --> 00:19:35.234
then she sends us, because
we need mail influences,

00:19:35.234 --> 00:19:36.999
her sons need male influences.

00:19:36.999 --> 00:19:38.790
So she sends us to live
with my father, who

00:19:38.790 --> 00:19:41.540
I live with for six
years, five to six years.

00:19:41.540 --> 00:19:44.400
In that time, I don't
see my mother at all.

00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:46.560
And my parents both have
the same parenting style,

00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:49.160
which is, out of
sight, out of mind.

00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:51.057
And so I dreamt of my mother.

00:19:51.057 --> 00:19:53.140
I had these huge streams
of who I thought she was.

00:19:53.140 --> 00:19:57.230
They were Disney prone,
and very way too much

00:19:57.230 --> 00:19:59.650
imaginings of this
dream girl in my life.

00:19:59.650 --> 00:20:01.304
And so when I went
back to Hawaii,

00:20:01.304 --> 00:20:03.470
I thought I was going to
be the perfect son for her,

00:20:03.470 --> 00:20:06.320
and butch up, and Wendy
is like, girl, no.

00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:06.989
That's not true.

00:20:06.989 --> 00:20:09.030
I'm looking at you, and
I don't see that anymore.

00:20:09.030 --> 00:20:10.880
And so I was like I'm going to
hold onto it for a little bit

00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:11.920
more for my mother.

00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:12.420
Right?

00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:14.753
Because I think as children,
that's what we internalize.

00:20:14.753 --> 00:20:17.290
If we do the right
things, if we are perfect,

00:20:17.290 --> 00:20:20.290
our parents will truly see us,
and love us, and except us,

00:20:20.290 --> 00:20:21.790
and give us everything
that we want.

00:20:21.790 --> 00:20:22.635
MICHAEL BOLOGNINO: I
want to actually, I

00:20:22.635 --> 00:20:23.975
remember-- sorry
to interrupt you,

00:20:23.975 --> 00:20:25.770
but I remember seeing that work
that you did so well at school.

00:20:25.770 --> 00:20:28.275
And that kind of pride,
I think, is in line

00:20:28.275 --> 00:20:29.380
with what you're saying.

00:20:29.380 --> 00:20:32.135
That's part of being the perfect
child, is studying and getting

00:20:32.135 --> 00:20:32.700
good grades.

00:20:32.700 --> 00:20:33.949
JANET MOCK: Oh yeah, for sure.

00:20:33.949 --> 00:20:37.500
And so I think that I really
began, and within that year,

00:20:37.500 --> 00:20:39.780
I began really seeing my
mother for who she was.

00:20:39.780 --> 00:20:42.300
She was no longer this
dream girl image of her.

00:20:42.300 --> 00:20:44.140
She was herself.

00:20:44.140 --> 00:20:47.572
And I think it did not
live up to my-- no one

00:20:47.572 --> 00:20:49.030
can live up to the
expectations you

00:20:49.030 --> 00:20:50.629
have in your head of someone.

00:20:50.629 --> 00:20:52.170
And so for my mother,
there's a sense

00:20:52.170 --> 00:20:54.290
that she failed me,
in my childlike mind,

00:20:54.290 --> 00:20:55.680
in my adolescent mind.

00:20:55.680 --> 00:20:58.850
And so I decided to just
be myself after a while.

00:20:58.850 --> 00:21:03.350
And I was like, this pretending
to be someone else for her

00:21:03.350 --> 00:21:04.660
is not working for me anymore.

00:21:04.660 --> 00:21:07.410
And so that's when I
accepted Wendy's invitations

00:21:07.410 --> 00:21:08.110
of friendship.

00:21:08.110 --> 00:21:11.080
And that's when we begin
going to the thrift store,

00:21:11.080 --> 00:21:14.150
and pulling stunts
in the thrift store,

00:21:14.150 --> 00:21:17.722
and changing price tags for
like the color coded tag sales.

00:21:17.722 --> 00:21:19.680
Sometimes when you go,
it's like, the blue tags

00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:20.985
are 50% off.

00:21:20.985 --> 00:21:24.460
And so we were very much
scheming, and going in,

00:21:24.460 --> 00:21:25.150
it was a mess.

00:21:25.150 --> 00:21:26.540
But it was great.

00:21:26.540 --> 00:21:27.415
You know what I mean?

00:21:27.415 --> 00:21:29.960
It was how we found agency with
having very little resources.

00:21:29.960 --> 00:21:32.670
We could go in with $10
to $15, and leave what

00:21:32.670 --> 00:21:36.040
tons of little soccer
shorts, and high socks,

00:21:36.040 --> 00:21:38.430
and shoulder pads for hip
pads, and all these kind

00:21:38.430 --> 00:21:40.290
of little things that
we ended up doing.

00:21:40.290 --> 00:21:44.000
We carved out our own space
for womanhood together.

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:45.301
We developed that together.

00:21:45.301 --> 00:21:46.300
MICHAEL BOLOGNINO: Yeah.

00:21:46.300 --> 00:21:47.800
And she's still in
your life, right?

00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:50.960
JANET MOCK: Yeah, she's
still my closest friend.

00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:52.910
I think it's very interesting.

00:21:52.910 --> 00:21:59.110
We've had points when our lives
went in separate directions

00:21:59.110 --> 00:22:00.559
at certain points.

00:22:00.559 --> 00:22:01.600
I kind of write about it.

00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:04.310
And when we came back
to, in adulthood,

00:22:04.310 --> 00:22:06.195
really seeing each
other again, it's

00:22:06.195 --> 00:22:08.370
so great to have that
shared history with someone.

00:22:08.370 --> 00:22:11.330
But that history also
breeds so much intimacy.

00:22:11.330 --> 00:22:13.190
Because there's
nothing that I've ever

00:22:13.190 --> 00:22:16.490
had to explain
anything to Wendy.

00:22:16.490 --> 00:22:18.575
She just always has
seen me, and known me,

00:22:18.575 --> 00:22:20.590
and affirmed me, and
validated me, and also

00:22:20.590 --> 00:22:22.960
nurtured me as a friend.

00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:25.670
And I always think of
sisterhood, and just good

00:22:25.670 --> 00:22:27.560
friendships, and any
kind of relationships,

00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:29.990
whether they're
romantic, or platonic,

00:22:29.990 --> 00:22:32.857
or sisters, or
brothers, or siblings.

00:22:32.857 --> 00:22:35.190
That's the kind of relationship
she's always had for me.

00:22:35.190 --> 00:22:36.690
And I think of what
a blessing that

00:22:36.690 --> 00:22:40.330
was, for me to be a 12-year-old
to find that friendship,

00:22:40.330 --> 00:22:42.350
and then to develop
it and still have it

00:22:42.350 --> 00:22:46.455
now as a 30 something
year old person.

00:22:46.455 --> 00:22:47.580
MICHAEL BOLOGNINO: Totally.

00:22:47.580 --> 00:22:50.600
So in addition to the
people in your life,

00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:54.730
another theme that I saw come
through was music as something

00:22:54.730 --> 00:22:55.860
that you turned to.

00:22:55.860 --> 00:22:57.360
You already mentioned
"What A Man."

00:22:57.360 --> 00:23:02.620
But I read about Aaliyah, and
I read about Toni Braxton,

00:23:02.620 --> 00:23:04.170
and the list goes on.

00:23:04.170 --> 00:23:08.010
I'm actually curious, who do you
think, in today's music world,

00:23:08.010 --> 00:23:13.180
would be the equivalent for
a trans girl to look up to

00:23:13.180 --> 00:23:16.850
or [INAUDIBLE].

00:23:16.850 --> 00:23:19.530
JANET MOCK: I think pop
culture's so personal.

00:23:19.530 --> 00:23:21.250
So I think it's hard to say.

00:23:21.250 --> 00:23:25.010
I think some, obviously trans
girls, we're not all the same,

00:23:25.010 --> 00:23:27.810
so we would all like
different kinds of music.

00:23:27.810 --> 00:23:28.810
Some may be into punk.

00:23:28.810 --> 00:23:30.045
That's not my thing.

00:23:30.045 --> 00:23:31.100
You know what I mean?

00:23:31.100 --> 00:23:34.780
So I think for me, I was
very Pop R&amp;B oriented.

00:23:34.780 --> 00:23:39.890
So that's why when Destiny's
Child came out with "No, No,

00:23:39.890 --> 00:23:43.620
No," "Bills, Bills, Bills," and
"Say My Name," and "Independent

00:23:43.620 --> 00:23:45.200
Woman," that was my life.

00:23:48.040 --> 00:23:50.220
I basically have a
whole chapter dedicated

00:23:50.220 --> 00:23:52.620
to my love of Destiny's
Child and Beyonce.

00:23:52.620 --> 00:23:56.320
Because it just shows how
media representations,

00:23:56.320 --> 00:23:58.330
seeing yourself in media,
and someone else whose

00:23:58.330 --> 00:24:00.330
experiences are completely
different than yours,

00:24:00.330 --> 00:24:02.770
but who just has something
that resonates with you.

00:24:02.770 --> 00:24:04.978
And I think that for all of
us, that's very personal.

00:24:04.978 --> 00:24:06.600
But I think that
for me, I wanted

00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:10.000
to not only be literary
in my references,

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:12.450
because I talk about spending
a lot of time in libraries,

00:24:12.450 --> 00:24:15.710
and reading books by a
lot of women of color,

00:24:15.710 --> 00:24:17.420
like Toni Morrison
and Alice Walker,

00:24:17.420 --> 00:24:20.950
but also these media
representations of Beyonce,

00:24:20.950 --> 00:24:24.552
and Oprah Winfrey,
and Diana Ross.

00:24:24.552 --> 00:24:26.010
And all of these
women just kind of

00:24:26.010 --> 00:24:29.280
give me this whole composite
of self that really showed me.

00:24:29.280 --> 00:24:33.190
So I think that's very personal,
but it's also very shared too.

00:24:33.190 --> 00:24:35.630
I think we talked a
little bit about some

00:24:35.630 --> 00:24:38.345
of the points of pop culture--

00:24:38.345 --> 00:24:39.412
MICHAEL BOLOGNINO: Yes.

00:24:39.412 --> 00:24:40.620
JANET MOCK: Resonance for us.

00:24:40.620 --> 00:24:41.470
MICHAEL BOLOGNINO: Totally.

00:24:41.470 --> 00:24:41.969
Exactly.

00:24:41.969 --> 00:24:46.540
So have you encountered
any of these women

00:24:46.540 --> 00:24:48.480
since your book's come out?

00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:50.272
Has there been any
kind of crossover,

00:24:50.272 --> 00:24:52.090
or have you met any of them?

00:24:52.090 --> 00:24:53.590
JANET MOCK: No, not yet.

00:24:53.590 --> 00:24:54.560
Not yet, Beyonce.

00:24:54.560 --> 00:24:57.180
I've not met Beyonce.

00:24:57.180 --> 00:25:00.270
MICHAEL BOLOGNINO: This is your
chance to make an invitation.

00:25:00.270 --> 00:25:02.430
OK.

00:25:02.430 --> 00:25:04.722
All right, so I think we're
getting a little bit close.

00:25:04.722 --> 00:25:06.804
I have a few more things
that we could talk about,

00:25:06.804 --> 00:25:08.580
and then we'll open
it up for questions.

00:25:08.580 --> 00:25:11.310
So I want to talk
a little bit about

00:25:11.310 --> 00:25:13.460
your #GirlsLikeUs campaign.

00:25:13.460 --> 00:25:17.080
So tell us a little bit
about where that started,

00:25:17.080 --> 00:25:18.640
and where it's at today.

00:25:18.640 --> 00:25:23.000
JANET MOCK: So it started
specifically on Twitter

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:23.670
at first.

00:25:23.670 --> 00:25:27.800
And so it was a hashtag
of solidarity and space

00:25:27.800 --> 00:25:29.970
to share resources,
stories, experiences,

00:25:29.970 --> 00:25:32.360
and conversations
between trans women.

00:25:32.360 --> 00:25:34.990
And I started it in March
2012, and since then it's gone

00:25:34.990 --> 00:25:37.510
on to, of course,
Google+, and Facebook,

00:25:37.510 --> 00:25:39.970
and everywhere where
you can do hash tags.

00:25:39.970 --> 00:25:42.004
And so Tumblr, you'll
see a space for it,

00:25:42.004 --> 00:25:43.920
and Instagram, and all
these different spaces.

00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:46.130
So it's kind of like the
social media campaign

00:25:46.130 --> 00:25:50.440
to claim space, in virtual
space, which nowadays

00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:53.177
is kind of real life space,
for trans women in a world

00:25:53.177 --> 00:25:54.760
where trans women,
often it's not safe

00:25:54.760 --> 00:25:56.650
for them to leave their homes.

00:25:56.650 --> 00:25:58.191
I mean, I think that
that's something

00:25:58.191 --> 00:26:00.650
that people don't often realize.

00:26:00.650 --> 00:26:04.146
These social media
platforms can be a lifeline

00:26:04.146 --> 00:26:06.520
for a lot of people who are
struggling with identity, who

00:26:06.520 --> 00:26:09.710
are struggling with self,
who don't have validation,

00:26:09.710 --> 00:26:12.190
and affirmation, and
real life friendships.

00:26:12.190 --> 00:26:14.680
Because my experience
is very bizarre

00:26:14.680 --> 00:26:16.620
that I grew up with
a trans girlfriend.

00:26:16.620 --> 00:26:18.990
My best friend was trans.

00:26:18.990 --> 00:26:20.240
I didn't grow up in isolation.

00:26:20.240 --> 00:26:22.960
But most trans women
grow up in isolation.

00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:24.390
They're often the only ones.

00:26:24.390 --> 00:26:27.250
And so to have a space
for young, and poor,

00:26:27.250 --> 00:26:30.120
and all these different kinds
of trans women to come together

00:26:30.120 --> 00:26:33.160
and say, you know what, in this
space, on Twitter, on Facebook,

00:26:33.160 --> 00:26:36.670
on Google+, we can have a space
that's our own that we can go

00:26:36.670 --> 00:26:40.720
to for a source of mirroring,
and reflections, and sharing,

00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:41.810
and sisterhood.

00:26:41.810 --> 00:26:43.370
That's what
#GirlsLikeUs has always

00:26:43.370 --> 00:26:46.700
been for me and my idea
of what I want it to be.

00:26:46.700 --> 00:26:49.190
I don't know where
I'm taking it yet,

00:26:49.190 --> 00:26:51.400
because I feel like there's
just so much going on.

00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:54.500
But I would like it to still,
I think that for me, it

00:26:54.500 --> 00:26:57.010
would be creating a
real life space for it.

00:26:57.010 --> 00:26:59.010
I think that it is
still like, #GirlsLikeUs

00:26:59.010 --> 00:27:02.980
as a name, and a brand, is
something that I want to have,

00:27:02.980 --> 00:27:05.760
maybe for like a summer
camp for young trans girls.

00:27:05.760 --> 00:27:07.990
That would be my
legacy project that I

00:27:07.990 --> 00:27:09.569
would love to do with it.

00:27:09.569 --> 00:27:10.610
MICHAEL BOLOGNINO: Great.

00:27:10.610 --> 00:27:11.140
OK.

00:27:11.140 --> 00:27:13.470
And then, I guess,
one more question.

00:27:13.470 --> 00:27:17.810
So it seems like lately, even
the last couple of weeks,

00:27:17.810 --> 00:27:20.180
trans visibility is
popping up in the media

00:27:20.180 --> 00:27:22.592
perhaps more than I
have seen it previously.

00:27:22.592 --> 00:27:24.550
You were featured in the
New York Times article

00:27:24.550 --> 00:27:28.530
last week alongside a
lot of other trans folks,

00:27:28.530 --> 00:27:31.690
we've got to Laverne Cox in
"Orange Is The New Black."

00:27:31.690 --> 00:27:34.800
Do you feel like there's some
kind of turning point brewing?

00:27:34.800 --> 00:27:37.800
What do you think is next?

00:27:37.800 --> 00:27:39.637
What has to happen next?

00:27:39.637 --> 00:27:41.220
JANET MOCK: I think
what has to happen

00:27:41.220 --> 00:27:46.930
next, is actions of
true inclusivity,

00:27:46.930 --> 00:27:51.200
meaning that trans people
are not these objects

00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:53.070
to be gawked at, and
kind of say, look

00:27:53.070 --> 00:27:55.330
at these trans
superstars, right,

00:27:55.330 --> 00:27:57.420
that's a separate thing from us.

00:27:57.420 --> 00:27:59.950
I think they really need to
have more and more spaces.

00:27:59.950 --> 00:28:01.800
I think one that I
would like to applaud,

00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:04.970
that I was lucky enough to
be a part of, and humbled

00:28:04.970 --> 00:28:08.000
to be a part of, was the
Women's History Month Google

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:12.260
Doodle, which included two
trans women of color in it,

00:28:12.260 --> 00:28:14.780
an Asian American
trans woman and myself.

00:28:14.780 --> 00:28:17.450
And that's the kind
of actions that really

00:28:17.450 --> 00:28:20.210
need to be happening, I
think, in media platforms,

00:28:20.210 --> 00:28:23.410
to really think about the
points of intersection which,

00:28:23.410 --> 00:28:26.230
trans women for me, trans
women are kind of how I center

00:28:26.230 --> 00:28:29.070
a lot of my politic,
how we can include

00:28:29.070 --> 00:28:31.000
trans women in their
different intersections

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:32.050
in a lot of these spaces.

00:28:32.050 --> 00:28:35.030
Because trans issues are
not its own separate issues,

00:28:35.030 --> 00:28:36.970
it's a human issue.

00:28:36.970 --> 00:28:38.500
We all have a
sexual orientation,

00:28:38.500 --> 00:28:39.974
we all have a gender identity.

00:28:39.974 --> 00:28:41.640
And we really break
it down in that way.

00:28:41.640 --> 00:28:46.780
We see people as more complex,
more across the spectrum

00:28:46.780 --> 00:28:48.620
of just speaking
across difference.

00:28:48.620 --> 00:28:50.750
So for me, I would love
for a big media moment

00:28:50.750 --> 00:28:55.840
to really happen, where a
media platform takes leadership

00:28:55.840 --> 00:28:57.630
in really sparking
a conversation.

00:28:57.630 --> 00:29:00.080
Say, like a Time
Magazine creating a cover

00:29:00.080 --> 00:29:02.769
to say that this is the
next civil rights movement.

00:29:02.769 --> 00:29:05.310
This is something that we really
need to begin talking about.

00:29:05.310 --> 00:29:07.250
Because a lot of people
do it as trend pieces,

00:29:07.250 --> 00:29:09.344
like, trans people are
having a moment now.

00:29:09.344 --> 00:29:11.010
And for me, my entire
life, trans people

00:29:11.010 --> 00:29:12.160
have been having moments.

00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:13.201
MICHAEL BOLOGNINO: Right.

00:29:13.201 --> 00:29:16.010
JANET MOCK: It's just like, you
decided to pay attention now?

00:29:16.010 --> 00:29:18.090
But we've been having
moments forever.

00:29:18.090 --> 00:29:20.470
Christine Jorgensen
was around in the '50s.

00:29:20.470 --> 00:29:24.610
And Carolyn Cossey was
around in the '80s and '90s

00:29:24.610 --> 00:29:25.730
on the Arsenio Hall Show.

00:29:25.730 --> 00:29:27.900
So none of this stuff is new.

00:29:27.900 --> 00:29:29.530
It's kind of
cyclical, and I think

00:29:29.530 --> 00:29:32.710
it's just media that says
that, oh, this is hot now.

00:29:32.710 --> 00:29:35.410
And so I think our culture
is ready to develop language

00:29:35.410 --> 00:29:38.826
and to really discuss
discourse with trans people

00:29:38.826 --> 00:29:40.200
about their actual
lives, and not

00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:42.080
so much about what they
do to their bodies,

00:29:42.080 --> 00:29:44.420
because that's been
tried and true and done.

00:29:44.420 --> 00:29:46.454
So I think that a lot of
the reason why there's

00:29:46.454 --> 00:29:48.870
been a lot of discourse lately
is because trans women have

00:29:48.870 --> 00:29:51.245
been at a point to say that
the way that you're reporting

00:29:51.245 --> 00:29:53.590
on my life is not cute anymore.

00:29:53.590 --> 00:29:55.580
And so this is why there's
an issue with this,

00:29:55.580 --> 00:29:58.960
and why it's reductive, and why
it's not enough, and that yes,

00:29:58.960 --> 00:30:00.880
you need to see us as people.

00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:02.886
I am a woman, and
that's who I am.

00:30:02.886 --> 00:30:04.760
I happen to be trans,
and happen to be black.

00:30:04.760 --> 00:30:06.530
But all of these things
are part of my experience,

00:30:06.530 --> 00:30:08.270
and if you really want
to engage with me,

00:30:08.270 --> 00:30:11.967
please read my book first and
then bring me on your show.

00:30:11.967 --> 00:30:12.800
Hashtag #ShadyQueen.

00:30:15.750 --> 00:30:17.840
MICHAEL BOLOGNINO: OK.

00:30:17.840 --> 00:30:19.120
This has been really great.

00:30:19.120 --> 00:30:23.520
I could keep talking to
you for hours, but I won't.

00:30:23.520 --> 00:30:26.865
So does anyone here in the
room have any questions?

00:30:32.094 --> 00:30:33.510
Oh yeah, please
use the microphone

00:30:33.510 --> 00:30:35.440
so the people on the
live stream can hear.

00:30:35.440 --> 00:30:35.990
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:30:35.990 --> 00:30:37.460
I don't really have a
question, but I just

00:30:37.460 --> 00:30:39.775
wanted to thank you for being
willing to be in the spotlight.

00:30:39.775 --> 00:30:41.060
JANET MOCK: Oh,
thank you so much.

00:30:41.060 --> 00:30:41.990
AUDIENCE: Very helpful.

00:30:41.990 --> 00:30:43.698
JANET MOCK: Thank you,
I appreciate that.

00:30:45.925 --> 00:30:47.550
AUDIENCE: I was just
thinking about how

00:30:47.550 --> 00:30:49.890
you're talking about being
seen for who you really are.

00:30:49.890 --> 00:30:52.580
Do you feel like it's
been difficult for people

00:30:52.580 --> 00:30:53.450
to see who you are?

00:30:53.450 --> 00:30:54.908
Have you become
very good at seeing

00:30:54.908 --> 00:30:57.811
other people for
who they really are?

00:30:57.811 --> 00:31:00.582
Or is that difficult
for you too?

00:31:00.582 --> 00:31:02.540
JANET MOCK: I think I
can only truly see people

00:31:02.540 --> 00:31:07.680
if they allow me to share
space with their experiences

00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:09.560
and stories.

00:31:09.560 --> 00:31:12.396
So for me, what I've learned
in this entire process of being

00:31:12.396 --> 00:31:14.020
very visible is not
to make assumptions

00:31:14.020 --> 00:31:16.710
about people's identities,
or lives, or pains,

00:31:16.710 --> 00:31:19.927
or points of access, or
exile and oppression.

00:31:19.927 --> 00:31:21.510
And so for me, I
think there's only so

00:31:21.510 --> 00:31:24.650
much you can tell about a
person by just looking at them.

00:31:24.650 --> 00:31:26.455
So for me, I think
that as a trans

00:31:26.455 --> 00:31:30.070
person, as a person of
color, as a woman of color,

00:31:30.070 --> 00:31:33.170
I don't make assumptions about
people anymore just based

00:31:33.170 --> 00:31:36.530
on my vain
interaction with them,

00:31:36.530 --> 00:31:37.904
or how I may perceive them.

00:31:37.904 --> 00:31:39.320
And so that's the
one thing that I

00:31:39.320 --> 00:31:41.760
think that I wish
that we all should do.

00:31:41.760 --> 00:31:44.810
So that's why I appreciate when
there's points of conversation

00:31:44.810 --> 00:31:47.869
in group settings when we say
that, what are your pronouns?

00:31:47.869 --> 00:31:49.410
You announce those
things, so that we

00:31:49.410 --> 00:31:51.744
don't assume what someone's
gender is, because you never

00:31:51.744 --> 00:31:53.285
know just based on
looking on people.

00:31:53.285 --> 00:31:55.470
But I think that we've
grown up in a culture where

00:31:55.470 --> 00:31:59.370
we just kind of assume people's
identities and genders.

00:31:59.370 --> 00:32:01.790
And that's not necessarily
something we should do anymore.

00:32:01.790 --> 00:32:04.530
And I hope that that's what
these conversations kind of

00:32:04.530 --> 00:32:06.120
spark and bring up.

00:32:06.120 --> 00:32:09.345
In terms of myself, I
find that oftentimes I'm

00:32:09.345 --> 00:32:11.390
invited to spaces
and only expected

00:32:11.390 --> 00:32:14.670
to speak about being
trans, whereas I think

00:32:14.670 --> 00:32:17.460
that my experience is so
much more than just transes.

00:32:17.460 --> 00:32:19.340
Not that speaking
about transes alone

00:32:19.340 --> 00:32:22.060
is something that I shy away
from or anything like that.

00:32:22.060 --> 00:32:23.080
But I'm also a
woman of color, I'm

00:32:23.080 --> 00:32:24.080
also someone that grew up poor.

00:32:24.080 --> 00:32:26.720
I'm also someone that, as a
teenager, engaged in sex work

00:32:26.720 --> 00:32:29.409
because I don't have
resources to have health care.

00:32:29.409 --> 00:32:30.950
And all these
different things that I

00:32:30.950 --> 00:32:34.090
think that I can speak to,
but I'm not really brought

00:32:34.090 --> 00:32:35.575
to the table to
speak about that.

00:32:35.575 --> 00:32:37.199
They're like, hey,
young woman, we just

00:32:37.199 --> 00:32:39.330
want to talk about
being trans right now,

00:32:39.330 --> 00:32:40.750
as if that's my only experience.

00:32:40.750 --> 00:32:41.910
And most times when
I navigate the world,

00:32:41.910 --> 00:32:43.400
most people don't
know I'm trans.

00:32:43.400 --> 00:32:47.770
They often take me for a
cisgendered mixed black woman,

00:32:47.770 --> 00:32:50.030
and what does that mean to
be that kind of a woman,

00:32:50.030 --> 00:32:51.780
someone that's objectified
in the streets,

00:32:51.780 --> 00:32:54.071
and all these kind of different
points of intersection.

00:32:54.071 --> 00:32:57.570
And so I hope that we can
have deeper conversations

00:32:57.570 --> 00:32:59.710
about people's
identities, and what

00:32:59.710 --> 00:33:02.547
their lives and lived
experiences are actually like.

00:33:02.547 --> 00:33:04.130
MICHAEL BOLOGNINO:
Actually, could you

00:33:04.130 --> 00:33:07.210
define cisgender for these
people who aren't familiar?

00:33:07.210 --> 00:33:07.950
JANET MOCK: Sure.

00:33:07.950 --> 00:33:11.530
Well, so there's trans.

00:33:11.530 --> 00:33:13.790
I think most people
understand what trans is.

00:33:13.790 --> 00:33:16.620
And cis this kind of the
opposite in terms of a prefix.

00:33:16.620 --> 00:33:21.220
So trans means to
cross, and cis,

00:33:21.220 --> 00:33:24.200
it's kind of like chemistry
terms, which is interesting.

00:33:24.200 --> 00:33:27.614
But this is really getting
inside baseball a little bit.

00:33:27.614 --> 00:33:29.030
I don't even know
what that means.

00:33:29.030 --> 00:33:30.920
I just often say
that, inside baseball,

00:33:30.920 --> 00:33:32.336
because I don't
even watch sports.

00:33:34.470 --> 00:33:36.750
But cis means on
the same side of,

00:33:36.750 --> 00:33:40.640
and so when you're talking
about cisgendered, or cissexual,

00:33:40.640 --> 00:33:43.150
transgender or transsexual,
trans often means to cross,

00:33:43.150 --> 00:33:44.900
and cis means to stay
on the same side of.

00:33:44.900 --> 00:33:46.740
So often we're talking
about relationships

00:33:46.740 --> 00:33:49.947
with your assigned sex at
birth, which we are all

00:33:49.947 --> 00:33:51.780
based on the way that
our genitals may look.

00:33:51.780 --> 00:33:53.330
When we're born
as babies, you're

00:33:53.330 --> 00:33:57.040
assigned a sex, which is often
different from your gender

00:33:57.040 --> 00:33:58.290
expression.

00:33:58.290 --> 00:34:02.540
And so for cis people, they
often times, most likely,

00:34:02.540 --> 00:34:04.600
identify with the sex
and gender that they

00:34:04.600 --> 00:34:05.880
were assigned with that birth.

00:34:05.880 --> 00:34:07.500
So they stay on
the same side of,

00:34:07.500 --> 00:34:11.730
whereas trans people cross
that, or are perceived

00:34:11.730 --> 00:34:13.900
to cross some kind
of invisible barrier

00:34:13.900 --> 00:34:16.210
that we have in our culture
about gender and sex,

00:34:16.210 --> 00:34:18.260
and sex that's
assigned at birth.

00:34:18.260 --> 00:34:19.866
So I hope that
explained that well.

00:34:19.866 --> 00:34:21.449
MICHAEL BOLOGNINO:
Yeah, thank you OK,

00:34:21.449 --> 00:34:23.440
are there any other
questions from the room?

00:34:23.440 --> 00:34:25.997
OK.

00:34:25.997 --> 00:34:26.580
AUDIENCE: Hey.

00:34:26.580 --> 00:34:26.860
JANET MOCK: Hi.

00:34:26.860 --> 00:34:28.080
AUDIENCE: First off,
thank you for being here.

00:34:28.080 --> 00:34:30.000
This has been really
great to watch.

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:31.375
JANET MOCK: Thank
you for coming.

00:34:31.375 --> 00:34:36.060
AUDIENCE: There's this idea in
the gay world of guys or girls

00:34:36.060 --> 00:34:38.560
who can pass.

00:34:38.560 --> 00:34:41.300
Guys might be
masculine, or might not

00:34:41.300 --> 00:34:43.389
look like the
stereotypical image of what

00:34:43.389 --> 00:34:45.027
a homosexual looks
like to society.

00:34:45.027 --> 00:34:46.360
JANET MOCK: Whatever that means.

00:34:46.360 --> 00:34:47.690
AUDIENCE: Whatever that means.

00:34:47.690 --> 00:34:49.590
But what it means
in day to day life

00:34:49.590 --> 00:34:51.750
is that they have
to keep coming out

00:34:51.750 --> 00:34:54.570
in the workplace with new
colleagues, with new friends,

00:34:54.570 --> 00:34:58.200
they keep saying, hey, I'm gay,
by the way, this is who I am,

00:34:58.200 --> 00:35:00.340
because you can't tell.

00:35:00.340 --> 00:35:03.109
Do you feel you need to keep
coming out in your life?

00:35:03.109 --> 00:35:04.650
And maybe now it's
a little different

00:35:04.650 --> 00:35:05.650
because you're in the spotlight.

00:35:05.650 --> 00:35:06.706
But in general, do
you feel like you

00:35:06.706 --> 00:35:08.480
have to keep coming
out about who you are?

00:35:08.480 --> 00:35:09.810
Is that tiring for you?

00:35:09.810 --> 00:35:12.160
And do you ever just
want to be a young woman

00:35:12.160 --> 00:35:16.020
and live, and not have to keep
explaining who you are in life?

00:35:16.020 --> 00:35:18.646
JANET MOCK: So for me, I
think that I write something.

00:35:18.646 --> 00:35:20.020
That's a really
great question, I

00:35:20.020 --> 00:35:21.478
think that what
we're talking about

00:35:21.478 --> 00:35:23.720
is also gender expectations.

00:35:23.720 --> 00:35:26.830
And I think that's
the link between trans

00:35:26.830 --> 00:35:28.860
and lesbian, gay,
bisexual people,

00:35:28.860 --> 00:35:31.190
is this idea of
gender expectations.

00:35:31.190 --> 00:35:33.730
So if you're assigned
male at birth,

00:35:33.730 --> 00:35:38.080
and you're attracted to men,
that's not following the gender

00:35:38.080 --> 00:35:41.440
prescriptions that we prescribe
in our culture, right?

00:35:41.440 --> 00:35:44.290
And so oftentimes that means
that to be a gay man that

00:35:44.290 --> 00:35:47.487
is feminine presenting, then
people go, oh yeah, he's gay.

00:35:47.487 --> 00:35:49.320
Whereas you can be a
completely straight man

00:35:49.320 --> 00:35:51.520
and also be feminine
presenting, but we're

00:35:51.520 --> 00:35:54.060
talking about gender
expectations, right?

00:35:54.060 --> 00:35:58.695
So when you say a man who
isn't seen as homosexual,

00:35:58.695 --> 00:36:02.080
and has to continue to come out
because he presents in a more

00:36:02.080 --> 00:36:04.740
traditionally masculine way,
even though he's attracted

00:36:04.740 --> 00:36:06.700
to men, which often is
prescribed as something

00:36:06.700 --> 00:36:08.380
that women do, not
necessarily men,

00:36:08.380 --> 00:36:11.120
which is very simplistic, right?

00:36:11.120 --> 00:36:14.380
And so for me, I do
have trouble with that.

00:36:14.380 --> 00:36:18.370
And I come out, and I
disclose my identity

00:36:18.370 --> 00:36:20.910
as a trans woman for
political reasons.

00:36:20.910 --> 00:36:22.680
Often in my personal
life, I don't.

00:36:22.680 --> 00:36:25.820
It's not something that
I do every single day.

00:36:25.820 --> 00:36:29.030
I don't feel like it's people's
right to know my story,

00:36:29.030 --> 00:36:31.520
that my story is mine
to tell in spaces

00:36:31.520 --> 00:36:33.670
of intimacy and relationship.

00:36:33.670 --> 00:36:35.740
And if I feel like telling
someone, then I do.

00:36:35.740 --> 00:36:37.720
But I never felt
an obligation to.

00:36:37.720 --> 00:36:42.870
Often in public spaces I do, if
the context is to talk about,

00:36:42.870 --> 00:36:44.940
or to place me
sometimes as trans.

00:36:44.940 --> 00:36:47.565
So it's like, so why are you in
this LGBT space with this man,

00:36:47.565 --> 00:36:49.190
because you look like
a straight woman.

00:36:49.190 --> 00:36:51.740
Well, I am a straight woman,
but I am a trans woman.

00:36:51.740 --> 00:36:54.830
And so it's really unpacking
that for people oftentimes.

00:36:54.830 --> 00:36:56.540
But I don't feel an obligation.

00:36:56.540 --> 00:36:57.659
Politically, I do.

00:36:57.659 --> 00:36:59.700
And so I think that coming
out or inviting people

00:36:59.700 --> 00:37:02.310
into your life is a
politicized movement

00:37:02.310 --> 00:37:04.230
that we all do in
our personal lives.

00:37:04.230 --> 00:37:07.390
And I choose to do that in
certain strategic spaces,

00:37:07.390 --> 00:37:10.666
but oftentimes I don't
feel the obligation to.

00:37:10.666 --> 00:37:11.490
Yeah.

00:37:11.490 --> 00:37:11.991
Thank you.

00:37:11.991 --> 00:37:13.198
MICHAEL BOLOGNINO: Thank you.

00:37:13.198 --> 00:37:15.780
All right, it doesn't look
like there are other questions,

00:37:15.780 --> 00:37:18.330
so I want to thank you,
Janet, again for coming.

00:37:18.330 --> 00:37:20.810
I want to let everyone know
that "Redefining Realness" is

00:37:20.810 --> 00:37:23.010
available everywhere
books are sold.

00:37:23.010 --> 00:37:24.470
And I encourage you to read it.

00:37:24.470 --> 00:37:25.330
I read it twice.

00:37:25.330 --> 00:37:27.080
It's excellent.

00:37:27.080 --> 00:37:28.620
So thanks again,
Janet, for coming.

00:37:28.620 --> 00:37:30.120
JANET MOCK: Thank
you for having me.

00:37:30.120 --> 00:37:31.104
Thank you all.

00:37:31.104 --> 00:37:37.652
