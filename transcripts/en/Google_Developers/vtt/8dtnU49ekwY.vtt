KAY: My name is Erik Kay. I want to welcome

00:00:11.019 --> 00:00:17.070
you to this presentation. This is Developing
web apps for the Chrome Web Store. I am the

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:24.230
tech lead on the Chrome apps team. So before
we get started, you've seen this in other

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:28.510
presentations but if you want to--if you're
not--don't want to up to the mic at the end

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:34.670
to ask questions, feel free to use this link
to go to a wave to ask questions in the moderator

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:40.510
or vote up other people's question. Well,
if we don't have enough live questions we'll

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:47.399
go to those. Okay. So before we get going
into this, I want--I just want to have a recap

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:54.350
a little bit about what we talked about in
yesterday's keynote. First of, we talked about

00:00:54.350 --> 00:01:00.590
HTML file and the amazing progress that's
been made over the last couple of years on

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:08.130
that front. Not just in what the capabilities
are that had been added but, you know, the

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:14.000
adoption by browser makers and how that's
going to progress over the next year. We also

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.970
showed how--when you take web apps and really
take advantage of all that functionality,

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:26.490
how truly awesome they can be that they can
be every bit as good as native applications.

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:32.630
And finally, we announced the Web Store where
we're trying to do our part to improve app

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:40.220
discovery to make it easy for developers to
monetize their web apps. And, you know, all

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:48.340
these together we see as all parts in trying
to build and improve the web app ecosystem.

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:54.150
Okay. In this talk, I'm going look at this--look
at web apps from two different perspectives.

00:01:54.150 --> 00:02:00.850
I want to look at from the user perspective,
and for users it's all about, you know, how

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:07.009
can I get better web apps, you know, what's
going to make web apps as good as what I'm

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:13.781
used to on a desktop or on my mobile device
and how can it be easier to get them. For

00:02:13.781 --> 00:02:20.620
developers, first and foremost, it's, look,
how do I make money doing this? And then,

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:26.700
you know, how do I actually build them to
start with? I really hope at the end that

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.231
you're going to come away very excited about
the possibilities about what we're doing here

00:02:30.231 --> 00:02:37.579
because I certainly am. I think that the net
results of all these should be that end-users

00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:42.200
are going to start getting really great web
apps and a really great experience and developers

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.180
are going to be making more money and it's
not going to be a lot of extra effort to go

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:52.829
it. So before we get into the meat of it,
I want to give one little caveat which is

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:58.840
Chromes and open source project, and that's
a blessing and a curse sometimes. The--on

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:04.160
the plus side, it means that you guys get
to see some of the stuff really early on.

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:09.100
When we check stuff into the source tree,
you know, people see what we're doing and

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:13.600
we have--we literally have reporters that
watch our check-ins and look for interesting

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:17.870
things and then report on that, so we can't
keep secrets for long. So the interesting

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:23.049
bit is you get to find out about stuff like
this very early on. It makes our life a little

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:30.419
bit trickier at times but that's as it is.
But as a result, what you're seeing here is

00:03:30.419 --> 00:03:36.630
a technology preview, it's going to change
and not all of it all together and we don't

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:42.380
have all the answers. But we hope to give
you an idea of the direction and the motivations

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:50.229
behind what we're doing. Okay. So ground zero;
from the user's perspective, what are web

00:03:50.229 --> 00:03:56.310
apps. Well, you know, I think everybody in
this room knows but, you know, we know it

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:02.759
when we see it, right? It's Gmail, it's maps,
it's mint.com, it's Pandora. Basically, it's

00:04:02.759 --> 00:04:07.840
rich applications that are built using web
technologies designed to run in a web browser,

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:13.810
right? Their data tends to be stored in a
Cloud and that means it's available everywhere.

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:18.480
So, your home computer, your work computer,
your phone on the go; it's ubiquitous. It

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:25.130
doesn't matter what operating system, what
device you're using. The web is truly everywhere.

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:31.500
But from a user perspective, web apps can
be hard to find. You know, the first problem,

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:37.140
before we even get to finding them is just
knowing that they exist. Awareness is a big

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:42.210
deal. I mean, I'm sure, you've all had this
experience. I have myself of--you've been

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:46.540
using some cool web app and you show it to
a friend, you know, family member or whatever

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:51.450
and they go, "Oh, my god. What's that? I had
no clue that something like that even existed.

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:57.320
Why didn't anybody tell me?" And there's a
lot of these things that are out there that

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:03.840
just don't get the attention they should.
Part of this is because there are no authoritative

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:10.010
sources for web apps. There's no place you'd
go that shows you what are the good ones,

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:14.780
right? What are the ones that users use the
most, that they reviewed the best? What are

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:20.400
the ones that are going to help me the most?
You heard some examples in the keynote about

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:26.420
trying to find your, you know, a particular
game that you're interested in and how--the

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:32.162
fact that you can find them but you don't
know which ones are, you know, you don't see

00:05:32.162 --> 00:05:36.510
reviews intermixed, you don't see popularity
intermixed. And, in fact, it's a little worse

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:41.560
than that and that you'll often see things
that are, you know, platform specific or device

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:49.010
specific mixed in with the web apps that are--that
you're trying to find. So on top of that,

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:54.170
you know, the apps themselves don't actually
do a lot to help search engines, you know,

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:59.630
find them. Part of this is just due to the
nature of what is an app. An app is not necessarily

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:05.100
content itself but it contains other content
and often the content it contains is personal,

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:11.150
it's private to yourself. So, that content
might not be crawlable. The web apps don't

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:16.700
necessarily have a lot of information to crawl
that describes what they are that helps the

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:24.740
search engines reinforce what's, you know,
the normal tricks that they use to find things.

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:29.090
So when you find an app or web app out there,
you know, most of them you'll find are free

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:34.120
or ad supported, but, occasionally, you'll
find some that people charge money for, and

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:41.990
that--they tend to have a pretty poor experience.
Part of the reason is because as a user, you

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:46.580
know, when you come across, you know, a web
form that says, "Okay, I want to buy something

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:51.770
on the web." You know, regardless of what
it is, there's an immediate question of trust.

00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:57.780
First of, who are these guys? Now, a lot of
web apps are being built by small, unknown

00:06:57.780 --> 00:07:02.770
companies. These are things that, you know,
people haven't heard of before, and giving

00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:06.830
over your credit card information, your personal
information requires a certain amount of trust.

00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:11.800
So, there's the hesitation, should I do this,
and that you'll lose some number of users

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:16.520
just from trust right there. The next thing
is that actually filling out your payment

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:21.770
information as inconvenient. It can be multiple
pages of forms just to be able to buy a really

00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:27.330
simple thing. And the ironic thing about this
is that, the cheaper, you know, the purchase

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:33.070
is the more likely that those trust and inconvenience
issues actually get in the way and make it--so

00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:38.370
you say, "Ah, I'm not going to bother. It's
just, you know, a $5 thing or a $10, it's

00:07:38.370 --> 00:07:47.380
not worth my time." So, okay, so now you've--let's
say you get a web app. You know, we've gotten

00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:54.580
pass some of those hard to find, hard to buy
questions, but once you'll get a web app when

00:07:54.580 --> 00:08:02.590
there--if you look at how they interact with
browsers today, it's not ideal. Web apps sort

00:08:02.590 --> 00:08:08.450
of by definition are special to users. These
are the things where you've got your data

00:08:08.450 --> 00:08:14.550
in, your time in; you have--you're using it
as, you know, day-to-day stuff. It's important

00:08:14.550 --> 00:08:20.461
to you. But the browser doesn't make it particularly
important. It treats it just like any other--any

00:08:20.461 --> 00:08:26.130
old page. So if you look at, you know, this
browser here, you know, can you tell which

00:08:26.130 --> 00:08:30.180
ones are the web apps, which are ones are
the ones that are important to me, you know.

00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:35.120
Now, some of you might recognize a few of
the icons, but as you get a lot more tabs

00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:44.720
even that becomes hard to find. You know,
further, you know, a lot of these apps, if

00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:49.540
you compare them in to desktop apps, they're
missing a lot of functionality that you come

00:08:49.540 --> 00:08:52.860
to expect. They don't have deep OS integration.
They don't have, you know, a shortcut to launch

00:08:52.860 --> 00:09:01.920
it. They don't have an entry to in the taskbar
to dock. They don't have fast apps switching.

00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:07.310
They can't open document types. They don't
have access to a lot of the underlying capabilities

00:09:07.310 --> 00:09:14.450
that you're used to at seeing in normal desktop
apps. And they're not trusted to take--to

00:09:14.450 --> 00:09:19.900
use that functionality. And the--part of the
reason is because of the trust model, the

00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:25.990
security model in the Web. The nice thing
about the security model in the Web is it's

00:09:25.990 --> 00:09:31.529
set up in such a way that you can click on
a link, any old link and not really worry

00:09:31.529 --> 00:09:35.580
too much about it. This is different from
desktop applications where if you run any

00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:40.150
old desktop application, you know, who knows
what's going to happen to your computer, you

00:09:40.150 --> 00:09:45.230
know, versus with all the spyware and malware
and whatever out there. But in general, clicking

00:09:45.230 --> 00:09:49.860
on a link at a web browser should be safe.
You should be able to trust that it does something

00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:55.610
reasonable. But part of that trust, part of
that security model enforces limited capabilities.

00:09:55.610 --> 00:10:01.481
And in the case where we have web apps that
we trust that we know, we want them to do

00:10:01.481 --> 00:10:09.140
more, the web apps, the web security model
gets in the way of that. Okay. Let's see if

00:10:09.140 --> 00:10:20.730
we can improve some things. We're going to
get a demo together here. Let's see if the

00:10:20.730 --> 00:10:34.149
technology cooperates with us. Okay. Okay.
So you saw this in the demo yesterday. Here's

00:10:34.149 --> 00:10:39.480
our--another take on our--on the Chrome's
new tab page. You could see, we've got this

00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:46.980
new section at the top which is where we show
all the apps that you have installed. And

00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:51.950
prominently, in there, right away, we have
an icon for the Web Store. So when you click

00:10:51.950 --> 00:10:57.670
on the Web Store, it, you know, takes you
right in there and you could start browsing

00:10:57.670 --> 00:11:04.770
apps. Now, I want to reinforce that. It's--the
Web Store is always--is one click away. We're

00:11:04.770 --> 00:11:10.990
integrating it deeply into the browser. This
is going to be important. So you get to the

00:11:10.990 --> 00:11:17.370
store and it has everything you would expect
it to have. It has categories, it has search,

00:11:17.370 --> 00:11:24.290
it has reviews and ratings, it has--you could
tell which are the most popular ones, it has

00:11:24.290 --> 00:11:31.529
promotional areas for things that, you know,
we think are interesting, and a lot of room

00:11:31.529 --> 00:11:38.839
to do things like social recommendations or
other ways to help you discover apps. But

00:11:38.839 --> 00:11:43.320
first and foremost, just--you can browse.
You can see what's new and interesting. And

00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:49.649
if you see what you like and you all saw the
demo for Darkroom, the keynote I expect and

00:11:49.649 --> 00:11:54.380
we're as impressed as I was, so I'd like to
get that now. And when I see that there, I

00:11:54.380 --> 00:11:59.870
could hit buy in. And if you take a closer
look here, you can see what we've got is the

00:11:59.870 --> 00:12:06.870
purchases using Google check out. Now, this
is something that if you have the account,

00:12:06.870 --> 00:12:08.550
you should, basically, at this point only
have to type in the password to continue and

00:12:08.550 --> 00:12:22.790
you'll get the app. Basically, this is a part
we're reducing buy in friction. Trust, it's

00:12:22.790 --> 00:12:28.320
Google, right? So it's not somebody--some
small random company you've never heard of,

00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:33.770
so it's easy to say, "Oh, if there's a problem
I can go to Google. I can deal with that.

00:12:33.770 --> 00:12:41.279
They're going to take care of me." And because
it's part of this Web Store, it's not too

00:12:41.279 --> 00:12:45.390
inconvenient to even set it up that first
time because you know there's likely going

00:12:45.390 --> 00:12:49.970
to be more stuff and more reason to come back
for repeat purchases. So now you've got this

00:12:49.970 --> 00:12:56.220
app and it shows up right in the launcher
and you saw it coming. And when we go ahead

00:12:56.220 --> 00:13:02.080
and launch it, you could see that it behaves
a bit differently from a normal tab. There's

00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:08.560
a few things to take a note of here. One is,
it created a tab on the left-hand side. It

00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:13.610
created it as a tab with just an icon. The
icon is a bit larger than your normal fab

00:13:13.610 --> 00:13:21.350
icon, so it's a bit easier to pick out and
see. We're automatically hiding the toolbar,

00:13:21.350 --> 00:13:25.820
the address bar. We're giving basically more
screen real state to the app and you can get

00:13:25.820 --> 00:13:33.680
back to that if you need to. But by default
we're trying to make the app front and center

00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:41.360
here. Further, let's launch one or two more
here, just get those app and see, oh, we'll

00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:51.590
put up YouTube and we'll go back and launch
TweetDeck. And you could see that each one

00:13:51.590 --> 00:13:58.040
came in again to the left in this sort of
separate area. There's a few other features

00:13:58.040 --> 00:14:04.380
we've got here. One is--let's say I were to
launch Darkroom again. What you'll see is

00:14:04.380 --> 00:14:08.540
that instead of actually creating a new tab
like you would typically have with the link

00:14:08.540 --> 00:14:14.640
that you click on, it actually refocuses the
app, iIt finds it, gives it a chance to respond

00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:19.910
and to handle that. Again, we're trying to
treat the app more like, you know, first-class

00:14:19.910 --> 00:14:28.519
citizen here. Also, we give the app some control
and some say over how should it launch and

00:14:28.519 --> 00:14:32.709
how it should present itself. So, these were
all launching the tab by default but when

00:14:32.709 --> 00:14:38.380
I launch tab Plants versus Zombies, you could
see that it jumps straight into full-screen

00:14:38.380 --> 00:14:42.470
mode, which is exactly what you'd expect.
The game should be immersive, should take

00:14:42.470 --> 00:14:49.680
you in, not pull you out. Now, all of these,
of course, is under user control. So, even

00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:55.170
though an app might have a preferred, you
know, way of working, you can decide that

00:14:55.170 --> 00:15:30.310
you want to treat things differently. Okay.
Let's pop back to... Okay. So let's talk about

00:15:30.310 --> 00:15:43.740
money. Now, obviously, you know, that's--this
is the big question, you know, how do we make

00:15:43.740 --> 00:15:52.470
money with web apps? As you know more people
are spending more of their time online everyday.

00:15:52.470 --> 00:15:58.970
The Web continues to grow. This continues
to be the best reach of any platform out there

00:15:58.970 --> 00:16:05.839
and it's only getting better. But, again,
as you k now, monetizing web apps is not always

00:16:05.839 --> 00:16:12.300
easy. Now, probably, the easiest way today
is to use advertising, and advertising has

00:16:12.300 --> 00:16:18.750
been great. It's really easy to set up, you
know, you just sign up for your account, drop

00:16:18.750 --> 00:16:25.149
in a little JavaScript on your page and, you
know, start getting checks. It's pretty easy

00:16:25.149 --> 00:16:31.860
on that front. But it may not work for everybody
and for all cases and so we want to provide

00:16:31.860 --> 00:16:39.800
other options. So, for example, it really
works best when you have a lot of traffic,

00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:45.510
you know, adds some volume. Advertising is
about volume. It's also has, you know, about,

00:16:45.510 --> 00:16:49.860
you know, having low fixed costs to run your
site. That's sort of the ideal case, a small

00:16:49.860 --> 00:16:55.140
shop with a lot of traffic. If you would say
a large new organization with a lot of foreign

00:16:55.140 --> 00:17:01.920
bureaus, that's a huge fixed cost to overcome.
If you're a small company, you know, getting

00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:07.819
enough traffic to even pay for your small
number of employees is a big hurdle to overcome

00:17:07.819 --> 00:17:13.260
to attract users. You might have a lot of
marketing cost to overcome. And if for whatever

00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:17.909
reason, you're costs are high or your traffic
is low, you don't actually get to set the

00:17:17.909 --> 00:17:23.659
price. It is what it is. So, you can't tweak
the knobs and say, "Oh, I need to charge more

00:17:23.659 --> 00:17:29.799
because--in order to make my business work,"
so in order to do that you really have to

00:17:29.799 --> 00:17:39.690
charge for it. So let's look at what it takes
to actually sell your web app today. Okay.

00:17:39.690 --> 00:17:45.460
So you can sell it but there've been a lot
of barriers to getting there. First of, it's

00:17:45.460 --> 00:17:50.179
actually pretty--it's a lot of work. You have
to integrate with payment processors, choose

00:17:50.179 --> 00:17:53.960
which one, choose which, you know, credit
cards you're going to accept and figure out

00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:57.739
all the legal arrangement you needed to make
to take that, deal with a lot of issues of

00:17:57.739 --> 00:18:01.899
like chargebacks and taxes if you need to
go international and most of you will because,

00:18:01.899 --> 00:18:08.070
you know, the Web is global. International
is a whole another bowl of wax. You need to

00:18:08.070 --> 00:18:12.980
have bank accounts in all the different countries
and deal with, again, all the local regulations

00:18:12.980 --> 00:18:18.340
and rules. Now, you combine some of those,
some of that pain, some of those difficulties

00:18:18.340 --> 00:18:23.200
with the problems I was talking about before,
you know, where there's a lot of buying friction

00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:28.509
for users and the users can't find you to
begin with and don't even know you exist.

00:18:28.509 --> 00:18:32.909
You're user acquisition cost wind up being
pretty high. You know, you have to, you know,

00:18:32.909 --> 00:18:38.370
do big marketing campaigns to drop people
there. And because every user accounts and

00:18:38.370 --> 00:18:45.049
you're, you know, trying to make it all work,
you--the common decision that's made is to

00:18:45.049 --> 00:18:49.039
try to be as broad as you can in terms of
which browser you're going to support and

00:18:49.039 --> 00:18:52.990
which features you're going to support. That
means that you've aimed for the least capable

00:18:52.990 --> 00:18:59.350
browser. You don't take advantage of all the
rich features of the Web because that's, you

00:18:59.350 --> 00:19:04.840
know, you need to reach as many users as you
can. We believe the Web Store can help cut

00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:11.179
through a lot of these issues. So first of,
we're here to try to do as much of heavy lifting

00:19:11.179 --> 00:19:16.649
as we can. We want to make the transaction
process as simple as we can and we want to

00:19:16.649 --> 00:19:21.779
handle the licensing and make that really
trivial. And the thing about this is that

00:19:21.779 --> 00:19:27.489
the Web is not a closed ecosystem. We're not--we
don't have a captive where you have no choice

00:19:27.489 --> 00:19:33.169
but to go through us. As I said, you can sell
in the Web today. There are other options.

00:19:33.169 --> 00:19:37.621
So we're competing against what else is out
there, so we've got to be good. We've got

00:19:37.621 --> 00:19:47.779
to compete against that and make things smoother
for people. So how do you do this? Well, as

00:19:47.779 --> 00:19:53.509
we've talked about, web apps are really, you
know, you know what they are. You build them

00:19:53.509 --> 00:19:59.470
exactly as normal. Once you've got your app,
we're ready to go. You then come and sign

00:19:59.470 --> 00:20:04.269
up for an account with the Web Store, you
know, just get your bank account set up, get,

00:20:04.269 --> 00:20:10.059
you know, verify your demand ownership, all
that kind of stuff. And if you want to sell,

00:20:10.059 --> 00:20:12.940
if you actually want charge for your app,
you can list free apps in the store as well,

00:20:12.940 --> 00:20:16.600
but if you wanted to charge for your app,
add a little glue code to your backend Web

00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:22.799
server to talk to a license server. And then
create a little bit of metadata to describe

00:20:22.799 --> 00:20:29.580
your app, your installable web app and package
it up and upload it to our server and then

00:20:29.580 --> 00:20:33.720
you'll be ready to go. So I just described
it, I was--but I'll show you a quick walk

00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:39.029
through of what it looks like today. Now,
for those of you who have built Chrome extension,

00:20:39.029 --> 00:20:43.179
this is all going to look really familiar
to you and that's not an accident. The Web

00:20:43.179 --> 00:20:48.399
Store is actually built on the same technology
that we use for--for the extension gallery,

00:20:48.399 --> 00:20:55.009
and in fact, the extension gallery will turn
in to the Web Store. What this means is that

00:20:55.009 --> 00:21:00.070
you're going to be able to sell themes and
extensions as well as web apps. But for those

00:21:00.070 --> 00:21:04.509
of you who haven't seen this, basically, you
have your little zip file of metadata; you

00:21:04.509 --> 00:21:10.590
upload it, you get to a little page that sort
of shows you what you're layout is going to

00:21:10.590 --> 00:21:14.580
look like. You set some--your icons, some
descriptions, you pick a category, you upload

00:21:14.580 --> 00:21:21.510
some screenshots, maybe a link to a YouTube
video, then you say publish and then it's

00:21:21.510 --> 00:21:30.820
live. Now, we're talking, you know, minutes,
not days, weeks, months. In most cases our

00:21:30.820 --> 00:21:36.389
aim--and this is true with the extension gallery
today. In most cases our aim is for approval

00:21:36.389 --> 00:21:43.259
to be automatic. There'll be--we obviously
have legal requirements and issues and, you

00:21:43.259 --> 00:21:48.460
know, policies that--where we have to like,
you know, potentially take things down to

00:21:48.460 --> 00:21:55.479
the local laws and whatnot. But in general,
things will get up and published without direct

00:21:55.479 --> 00:22:04.100
manual intervention. So Chrome users as you
saw in the keynote the other day have been

00:22:04.100 --> 00:22:13.119
growing pretty fast. We're over 70 million
active users and it's continuing to grow.

00:22:13.119 --> 00:22:20.059
Now, Chrome is integrated with the Web Store
right on the main page. As you have heard

00:22:20.059 --> 00:22:25.529
with our auto-update mechanism makes it so
that people are all pretty much running the

00:22:25.529 --> 00:22:30.830
latest versions of Chrome very quickly. As
we get things--these things out, everyone's

00:22:30.830 --> 00:22:36.320
got the latest stuff. So when the stable channel
goes--push goes out it has all of this stuff

00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:43.460
some time later this fall. You know, everybody
will have that Web Store icon in their browser

00:22:43.460 --> 00:22:47.759
and we'll have a lot more users than that
at this point. So that's a lot of users for

00:22:47.759 --> 00:22:54.220
guiding straight into the store. So this is
lower purchase friction, this is easy to find,

00:22:54.220 --> 00:22:59.440
easy to buy. Google is going to be putting
a fair amount of marketing effort into the

00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:03.940
store. We're going to be helping to promote
your apps. All of this is going to translate

00:23:03.940 --> 00:23:11.379
into a net lower cost of user acquisition
for you. Now, on top of that, Chrome as you

00:23:11.379 --> 00:23:19.080
know has all the latest HTML5 features in
it that you want. New stuff coming down the

00:23:19.080 --> 00:23:24.970
road like WebGL, existing stuff like all of
the great, you know, CSS transitions. I think

00:23:24.970 --> 00:23:30.519
what I'm trying to get at here is that this
is a lot of users and it's growing and you

00:23:30.519 --> 00:23:37.609
don't have to target the least capable browsers
anymore. You can take advantage of the best

00:23:37.609 --> 00:23:46.940
features and make your apps awesome and you
can make money doing that. This is all part

00:23:46.940 --> 00:23:53.019
of the web app ecosystem, right, and it starts
with you, the developer. I hope we're convincing

00:23:53.019 --> 00:24:00.019
you that it's worthwhile to really step back
and build your, you know, cool new HTML5 application.

00:24:00.019 --> 00:24:05.710
It's really easy, say, you put it out in the
store and as you know all the users are going

00:24:05.710 --> 00:24:09.450
to--all those Chrome users are going to be
coming to the store and some of them are going

00:24:09.450 --> 00:24:13.629
to find your app, love your app, give it great
reviews and give you some money in exchange

00:24:13.629 --> 00:24:20.629
for the app. And as we know money for developer
makes a happy developer. And hopefully convinces

00:24:20.629 --> 00:24:25.779
you to make more apps or make your apps even
better and, you know, we're adding more users

00:24:25.779 --> 00:24:29.890
all the time but more apps, you know, are
going to even draw even more users and, of

00:24:29.890 --> 00:24:35.299
course, more love and more money. I think
you got the idea. This is all a virtuous circle.

00:24:35.299 --> 00:24:43.129
It increases competition, increases app quality,
increases user happiness, you know, and all

00:24:43.129 --> 00:24:51.220
around. So I didn't go into too much detail
yet. Let's dive into a little bit of the knots

00:24:51.220 --> 00:24:59.280
and bolts of what goes into your actual app.
Now, any web app can go in the Web Store today.

00:24:59.280 --> 00:25:05.259
If it runs in Chrome, you know, built--just
using normal HTML5, Flash, whatever, you could

00:25:05.259 --> 00:25:10.240
package it up and put it in the store. However,
we think you should do more than that, right?

00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:15.320
We think you should be trying to take advantage
of--with a great new features of HTML5 and

00:25:15.320 --> 00:25:21.141
CSS3 and all the other amazing features that
are out there; there's a lot of them. And

00:25:21.141 --> 00:25:28.179
you--if you haven't gotten to see the HTML5
talk that happened yesterday, I encourage

00:25:28.179 --> 00:25:31.840
you to check out the video. There's another
talk later today that's going to talk about

00:25:31.840 --> 00:25:38.429
some of the features. I think there's a session
going on right after this at the Chrome Hack

00:25:38.429 --> 00:25:43.320
Alcove where you can walk through some of
the cool HTML5 stuff that you can do. If you

00:25:43.320 --> 00:25:48.190
haven't played around with this stuff, definitely
dive in and see what you can do. You saw some

00:25:48.190 --> 00:25:51.740
of the apps in the keynote but I think we're
really just scratching the surface of the

00:25:51.740 --> 00:25:56.159
level of polish and performance. I'd like
you to, though, not think of this, it's just

00:25:56.159 --> 00:26:00.119
a feature checklist, right? This isn't just
a, "Oh, I should add this feature. I should

00:26:00.119 --> 00:26:06.950
add that feature." We need to step back as
Web developers and think more like, you know,

00:26:06.950 --> 00:26:11.629
the way desktop app developers think. It's
about polish, it's about performance, it's

00:26:11.629 --> 00:26:16.679
about all these little niceties that make
it feel rock solid. How can we make these

00:26:16.679 --> 00:26:23.039
great apps, deal with offline, maintaining
state, you know, make it fast, you know, Chrome

00:26:23.039 --> 00:26:27.590
team are very passionate about speed and we
hope to pass on some of that passion to you

00:26:27.590 --> 00:26:31.489
as well. We really need to set a higher bar
for the quality and features set at these

00:26:31.489 --> 00:26:41.369
apps and if you don't other people well and
competition will be fierce there. So once

00:26:41.369 --> 00:26:45.840
you've made your app, we now want to make
it an installable app, an installable web

00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:52.629
app. So, to do that, we create a little bit
of metadata and that gets packaged up using

00:26:52.629 --> 00:26:56.340
the Chrome extension system. You don't have
to worry about that, we do that all for you

00:26:56.340 --> 00:27:01.749
on the Web Store. If you want to sell your
app, you do a little bit of glue to integrate

00:27:01.749 --> 00:27:15.620
with the license server. So--and then you're
ready to go. Now, so let's actually show this

00:27:15.620 --> 00:27:28.309
in action. Okay. So I've got a little app
here that you probably heard of before. Let's

00:27:28.309 --> 00:27:39.330
see. So--let's increase the font size here.
Hopefully, it's good enough for you to see.

00:27:39.330 --> 00:27:42.920
This is just a little bit of JSON. It's very
simple. There's not a lot to it. We have a

00:27:42.920 --> 00:27:49.570
name. We have a version. We have a list of
icons. We have a launch URL. And that's really

00:27:49.570 --> 00:27:54.149
about it. That's the meta--all the metadata
we need to describe it. You also saw that

00:27:54.149 --> 00:28:01.990
we had a set of icons that came with it that
helps us, you know, display it in all the

00:28:01.990 --> 00:28:10.489
different formats. So in order to develop
that against this, as I said, the technology

00:28:10.489 --> 00:28:15.389
here is built on the Chrome extension system.
It's kind of an implementation detail. I wouldn't

00:28:15.389 --> 00:28:23.919
get to hang up on it right now. All these
is--oops, check point. All of this is in progress

00:28:23.919 --> 00:28:28.259
and probably will change to get a little more
app specific. But for now we're demoing it

00:28:28.259 --> 00:28:35.929
using this--the extension system. So to do
that what you do is you just load the directory

00:28:35.929 --> 00:28:40.869
to load the metadata in and this will behave
just like you bought the web app from the

00:28:40.869 --> 00:28:45.940
store and you could see we now have our Google
Maps app sitting there ready to go. And we

00:28:45.940 --> 00:28:51.690
launch it and it has the app tab and its nice
icon and it's there and it behaves just like

00:28:51.690 --> 00:28:55.909
the app we got from the store. And really
that was it. It just that little bit of JSON,

00:28:55.909 --> 00:29:04.179
that extra icon and that was all to define
it. Now, what about richer capabilities, some

00:29:04.179 --> 00:29:09.019
of the additional features that we might want
to add. Well, one thing to--I don't know if

00:29:09.019 --> 00:29:15.429
everybody is aware of but actually Google
Maps had a geolocation support not long ago.

00:29:15.429 --> 00:29:22.119
And there's this little icon here on geolocation
enabled browsers that if you click on will

00:29:22.119 --> 00:29:26.590
cause you to jump to your current location.
But you can see here that actually what it

00:29:26.590 --> 00:29:31.330
did is it put up a little info bar on top
that says that maps.google.com wants to, you

00:29:31.330 --> 00:29:35.799
know, look at your location, is that okay.
And the user has to opt in, it has to say,

00:29:35.799 --> 00:29:42.409
"Yes, I trust the site to do this." So that's
great. This is--again, back to the trust model,

00:29:42.409 --> 00:29:47.529
the security model of the web. We don't want
any old brand and page to be able to see my

00:29:47.529 --> 00:29:52.899
physical location without me saying it's okay
for that to happen. But I've installed this

00:29:52.899 --> 00:29:57.899
app, you know, I've kind of given my signal
that I trust it. And the gallery will tell

00:29:57.899 --> 00:30:03.499
me what--upfront what the app can do and users
have reviewed it and helps me out to know

00:30:03.499 --> 00:30:13.710
that this is a trustworthy thing. So, I want
to let it do this implicitly. Now, if we--let's

00:30:13.710 --> 00:30:23.909
see. Let me show you sort of a worst case
thing that can happen here. With geolocation

00:30:23.909 --> 00:30:33.880
maybe it was all right. For--it might have
been all right to say, you know--let me ask,

00:30:33.880 --> 00:30:43.869
you know, I understand geolocation. Geolocation
makes sense, but what about if I want to use

00:30:43.869 --> 00:30:48.779
a few more features? If I want to make a rich
app that really took advantage of everything?

00:30:48.779 --> 00:30:53.429
Well, you could see, it can get pretty crazy,
you know, prompting user for every single

00:30:53.429 --> 00:30:59.210
little thing that it wants to do could get
out of hand. And there are a lot of rich capabilities

00:30:59.210 --> 00:31:05.700
coming to HTML and the web. And a lot of this
is being driven by a handset--the phone makers.

00:31:05.700 --> 00:31:10.509
Some of it, it's going to be driven by what's
happening in Chrome OS and basically our desire

00:31:10.509 --> 00:31:16.710
to make web apps more capable. Things like,
you know, access to your webcam, you know.

00:31:16.710 --> 00:31:22.190
Again, you wouldn't want ran in webpage to
do that without you getting into it. But,

00:31:22.190 --> 00:31:26.570
some of these features are actually, some
of the things we want to add don't necessarily

00:31:26.570 --> 00:31:30.820
make sense, they even ask you. Don't necessarily
make sense to prompt sometimes because they

00:31:30.820 --> 00:31:38.899
really trivial things; sometimes because they're
very hard to explain. Imagine say for example

00:31:38.899 --> 00:31:43.339
a website wanted to see check your idle state.
They want to see like whether you're away

00:31:43.339 --> 00:31:46.809
from your, stepped away from your computer.
This could be really useful if you want to

00:31:46.809 --> 00:31:52.539
make a web-based instant messaging client
for example. But, that could be privacy invading

00:31:52.539 --> 00:31:57.379
but that's kind of a hard thing to explain
in a little, you know, info bar, a little

00:31:57.379 --> 00:32:02.190
dialog. So, you know, you could imagine your
average user getting something that says,

00:32:02.190 --> 00:32:07.169
"Hey, this website wants to get access to
your idle time, you know, is that okay?" Say,

00:32:07.169 --> 00:32:13.779
"Well, I don't know, whatever, maybe." And,
or what if they want to access your pasteboard,

00:32:13.779 --> 00:32:19.269
that seems safe. Well, there's some security
ramifications to that but, it's, again, something

00:32:19.269 --> 00:32:26.190
might not want to try to explain. So there's
a lot of these things coming and we want to

00:32:26.190 --> 00:32:40.210
make the trust model simpler. So let's go
back and see how we could do that. Let's see.

00:32:40.210 --> 00:32:58.729
All right. So we have our geolocation app
here, oops. Let's see. Sorry. All right. Let's

00:32:58.729 --> 00:33:09.739
open up our manifest again, and what we're
going to do is add one additional field here.

00:33:09.739 --> 00:33:16.130
Again this would be familiar to people who
played around with extension system. We're

00:33:16.130 --> 00:33:22.779
going to add a geolocation permission. So
this is basically saying declaring upfront

00:33:22.779 --> 00:33:27.450
that I want my app to be able to use the geolocation
functionality. So this way we could expose

00:33:27.450 --> 00:33:32.669
in the gallery to people knowing that this
app uses this feature. And then what I want

00:33:32.669 --> 00:33:43.149
to debug this to try it out again. Just reload
it, launch it. And this time when I click

00:33:43.149 --> 00:33:51.700
on the geolocation thing you could see a jumps
right to my location without prompting me.

00:33:51.700 --> 00:33:57.262
So, we think this is, this model of, sort
of, having a user to be able to trust in app

00:33:57.262 --> 00:34:03.269
and say, yes, this app is something that I
like and that I use and I want to be more

00:34:03.269 --> 00:34:08.349
capable is much more intuitive. If you've,
you know, thought it all about security you

00:34:08.349 --> 00:34:14.369
know that asking users to answer complex security
questions isn't good security. It's also not

00:34:14.369 --> 00:34:20.380
good UI and asking users a lot of security
questions is even worse on both of those fronts.

00:34:20.380 --> 00:34:26.080
So our hope is that this simplifies this yet
keeps the security model intact. By the way,

00:34:26.080 --> 00:34:32.230
the other to note is that it also simplifies
the removing of these permissions, removing

00:34:32.230 --> 00:34:38.360
this capabilities because if you think about
20 different types of features that you might

00:34:38.360 --> 00:34:43.370
have granted to any old website, what's the
user interface for that look like. We'll there's

00:34:43.370 --> 00:34:47.430
going to be some options panels somewhere
in an advance setting that says, here's a

00:34:47.430 --> 00:34:51.000
list of all of the sites that have access
to geolocation. I want to block this site

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:55.179
and deny this site or something. Or here's
all the sites that I've ever granted any permission

00:34:55.179 --> 00:35:00.310
to at all and now I need to browse each one
and individually select it. In this model,

00:35:00.310 --> 00:35:05.560
you just uninstall the app. It's, all the
permissions are gone, you don't have to think

00:35:05.560 --> 00:35:23.560
about what did you grant, what didn't you
grant, is just all taken care of in one, one

00:35:23.560 --> 00:35:31.530
fell swoop. Okay. I'm sorry, one second. Technology,
it's great. Okay. So let's recap a little

00:35:31.530 --> 00:35:39.230
bit. So from a user's perspective, we're talking
about getting great apps, you know, that they're

00:35:39.230 --> 00:35:48.750
easy to find that they're more capable. From
a developer's perspective, it's easy to build.

00:35:48.750 --> 00:35:54.240
We're already doing it. We can, it's easy
to make money, it's easy to sell. There's

00:35:54.240 --> 00:35:59.850
lower cost of users. You know, basically,
the net effect should be, you know, we've

00:35:59.850 --> 00:36:05.240
got more options basically. You know, you
can keep doing things the way you do but,

00:36:05.240 --> 00:36:09.930
now things are more discoverable to users.
You can take advantage of the latest features

00:36:09.930 --> 00:36:18.340
and not worry that you're not reaching enough
users. So, okay, this is a meeting and nobody

00:36:18.340 --> 00:36:23.110
likes getting action items in meetings but,
I'm going to give you, guys, a few. So, the

00:36:23.110 --> 00:36:28.740
first thing you should do is you have already
is go check out the FAQ that we've setup.

00:36:28.740 --> 00:36:33.040
This, try to answer some of the, you know,
obvious questions about how this is all going

00:36:33.040 --> 00:36:37.580
to work and what's going to, what's happening
there. This is also by the way the location

00:36:37.580 --> 00:36:43.210
of the stores actually going to show up at
when it goes live. Check out the technical

00:36:43.210 --> 00:36:47.560
documentation, just see what's there. There's
not a lot to it. As you saw it's very simple

00:36:47.560 --> 00:36:53.990
so, what's up there today is very minimum
and also as I told you before, this is early

00:36:53.990 --> 00:37:02.330
on, so it's going to change, but keep an eye
on that. And then, go build a really cool

00:37:02.330 --> 00:37:08.090
app. Now, you know, or, convert your existing
app to, you know, use, you know, the cool

00:37:08.090 --> 00:37:16.500
HTML5 features you've seen at Google I/O here.
Basically, the clock is sort of ticking on

00:37:16.500 --> 00:37:21.483
the store now and I think this is a good opportunity
to get in early. We're going to have a developer

00:37:21.483 --> 00:37:25.320
preview where you're going to build, upload
stuff and play with the store sometime later

00:37:25.320 --> 00:37:31.200
this summer. And, in fall, it's going to be
opened up for consumers. So, this is all going

00:37:31.200 --> 00:37:35.920
to come pretty quickly, I'll be here before
you know it. And so, if you don't start on

00:37:35.920 --> 00:37:43.500
your app now, you know, you'll miss the initial
watch on that front. And join the discussions.

00:37:43.500 --> 00:37:50.550
Now, on the docs in FAQ sites, we've got some
links to some mailing list and but there's

00:37:50.550 --> 00:37:57.410
already plenty chromium, you know, just general
mailing list. We love getting community involvement.

00:37:57.410 --> 00:38:02.770
As an open source project, we have a lot of
external contributors. We have IRC channels,

00:38:02.770 --> 00:38:07.380
all of our sources have checked in, the public,
so you could all check all of this stuff out

00:38:07.380 --> 00:38:12.350
and get involved personally. If you want to
influence the direction that we're headed,

00:38:12.350 --> 00:38:15.970
if you want to change some of the things have
you think we're making some stupid decisions

00:38:15.970 --> 00:38:21.790
here and there, we love to hear it. And, you
know, it's not just about the web app and

00:38:21.790 --> 00:38:27.160
the web store stuff, it's about anything like,
you know, if you're not convinced that HTML5

00:38:27.160 --> 00:38:32.510
has everything you need today, let us know
about that too. We want to know what it takes

00:38:32.510 --> 00:38:39.660
to make, what you need to make your apps as
good as or better than desktop, mobile, you

00:38:39.660 --> 00:38:47.150
know, native equivalence. So, once again,
I think we've got a little time for questions.

00:38:47.150 --> 00:38:53.220
So if you want to ask live questions to the
mic, that's fine. Or we'll, we could check

00:38:53.220 --> 00:38:59.271
out the wave as well if you don't have enough
live questions. Sure.

00:38:59.271 --> 00:39:04.720
&gt;&gt; So, yeah, thanks for the presentation.
It's very interesting. So, there's another

00:39:04.720 --> 00:39:09.850
company that has a slogan, there's an app
for that. And, well, my question is the technology

00:39:09.850 --> 00:39:13.590
is really interesting but I'm not still convinced
that people are going to Chrome and try to

00:39:13.590 --> 00:39:17.290
buy apps. So can you talk a little bit about
what marketing initiatives are going to be

00:39:17.290 --> 00:39:23.260
made available for, like, obviously, you know,
this other company they push marketing out

00:39:23.260 --> 00:39:25.831
there that push people to go to the App Store.
&gt;&gt; KAY: Sure.

00:39:25.831 --> 00:39:30.830
&gt;&gt; What is Google going to do to like promote
apps and to make it, you know, because I still

00:39:30.830 --> 00:39:36.870
use Firefox as my primary browser and so,
if I'm not way, I'm a developer, I feel like,

00:39:36.870 --> 00:39:40.310
skepticism that people are actually going
to Chrome and want to buy stuff and know that

00:39:40.310 --> 00:39:45.330
it's even there?
&gt;&gt; KAY: Sure, sure. Well, I appreciate that.

00:39:45.330 --> 00:39:51.110
Yeah, if it's too early to talk about some
any detail, probably the specifics of our

00:39:51.110 --> 00:39:55.490
marketing initiatives is probably the one
that we're at least equipped to go into the

00:39:55.490 --> 00:39:59.650
specifics about right now unfortunately. But,
I think the big take home point is that this

00:39:59.650 --> 00:40:04.190
is an important initiative for us. It's something
that we take very seriously and you hit on

00:40:04.190 --> 00:40:10.590
another issue which is just Chrome adoption
in general. And this is also something that,

00:40:10.590 --> 00:40:16.020
you know, Google is very committed to and
we are spending, you know, a lot of effort

00:40:16.020 --> 00:40:20.450
not just on marketing but just on, you know,
putting our money where our mouth is quality

00:40:20.450 --> 00:40:26.600
wise. We're continuing to up to bar performance
wise, quality wise with the browser and we

00:40:26.600 --> 00:40:32.630
think that, you know, on that front action,
action speaks louder than words. But, yeah,

00:40:32.630 --> 00:40:38.490
we definitely want to drive more users, you
know, in the Chrome, into the web store. The

00:40:38.490 --> 00:40:46.850
other thing is that, you know, these apps,
I tried to make this clear before but, this

00:40:46.850 --> 00:40:51.840
is a question where we keep getting from people
is, you know, will these apps run in another

00:40:51.840 --> 00:40:57.230
browsers, and the answer is absolutely yes.
Step one, start with the web app. And we're

00:40:57.230 --> 00:41:02.370
encouraging to make a modern web app so maybe
you'll only run modern web browsers, you know,

00:41:02.370 --> 00:41:08.040
the latest Firefox, Safari, you know, Opera,
Chrome; but these apps should run in another

00:41:08.040 --> 00:41:14.580
browsers. All we've done is put patch up some
metadata to make it an installable web app

00:41:14.580 --> 00:41:17.940
that makes it a little bit better experience,
a little bit more integrated and with the

00:41:17.940 --> 00:41:22.550
browser, that doesn't change the core functionality
of the app, the app will still work. Likewise,

00:41:22.550 --> 00:41:29.870
if you buy the app, you know, that app should
still work, you know, in another browsers.

00:41:29.870 --> 00:41:36.650
&gt;&gt; Are the apps are going to be able to be
synchronized between my browser or in my Chrome

00:41:36.650 --> 00:41:39.119
in Linux or my Chrome in Windows on different
computers?

00:41:39.119 --> 00:41:46.010
&gt;&gt; KAY: Yeah, absolutely. I missed that earlier.
I meant to say that the--when you buy an app,

00:41:46.010 --> 00:41:50.990
it's tied to your account and we synch just
like other things are synched with synchronization

00:41:50.990 --> 00:41:55.210
features that are built into Chrome.
&gt;&gt; Just, another question, are we going to

00:41:55.210 --> 00:42:00.140
be able to sell extensions as well as apps?
&gt;&gt; KAY: Yes, extensions and themes as well

00:42:00.140 --> 00:42:07.041
as apps.
&gt;&gt; So, that telling with that other browsers

00:42:07.041 --> 00:42:14.320
that offer extensions since it's open source
and open, are you guys going to or have thought

00:42:14.320 --> 00:42:19.109
about allowing extensions from other browsers
to be sold within this store?

00:42:19.109 --> 00:42:24.720
&gt;&gt; KAY: It's a good question and I'll just
be honest and say, we haven't talked about

00:42:24.720 --> 00:42:29.940
it. I don't know if there's any particular
version to it. But, since we haven't talked

00:42:29.940 --> 00:42:34.150
about it, I'd just be speculating right now
about what we decide.

00:42:34.150 --> 00:42:41.385
&gt;&gt; Okay. And just let's assume that it's the
case like, you know, goading on this. Would

00:42:41.385 --> 00:42:45.700
you guys allow Potomac API that would allow
the importing of like a massive number of

00:42:45.700 --> 00:42:49.580
extensions?
&gt;&gt; KAY: We've actually had that question before

00:42:49.580 --> 00:42:57.040
and you know I think, it would have to be
sort of one off kind of thing. You know, not,

00:42:57.040 --> 00:43:01.370
it's not something we want to look at on a
general basis probably just because, you know,

00:43:01.370 --> 00:43:05.540
the potential, we want them at the potential
for spam and for other sort of things. But,

00:43:05.540 --> 00:43:10.110
you know, I think we'd open to, assume, especially
assuming we're willing to like, you know,

00:43:10.110 --> 00:43:17.160
look at other extensions systems than, yeah,
it make sense to consider that.

00:43:17.160 --> 00:43:19.200
&gt;&gt; Okay, cool.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, two questions for you. Is there any

00:43:19.200 --> 00:43:25.750
plans to include gadgets in the store at all?
&gt;&gt; KAY: What do you mean by gadgets?

00:43:25.750 --> 00:43:30.620
&gt;&gt; iGoogle gadgets.
&gt;&gt; KAY: Oh, not at this time. Again, it's

00:43:30.620 --> 00:43:37.030
mostly that right now, I guess, I shouldn't
answer that way. I should say, we haven't

00:43:37.030 --> 00:43:42.140
talked about it. So I'm on the Chrome team
and we've been focused on the things for Chrome

00:43:42.140 --> 00:43:47.490
in particular and we just haven't tried with
the iGoogle folks about that. But, there's

00:43:47.490 --> 00:43:51.020
certainly the opportunity once we have the
infrastructure in place to consider selling

00:43:51.020 --> 00:43:55.820
other things like, you know, other extensions
or iGoogle gadgets or, you know, whatever

00:43:55.820 --> 00:44:00.369
else. But, right now, we're focused on apps
extension themes for Chrome.

00:44:00.369 --> 00:44:05.930
&gt;&gt; Okay. And certainly my question, is in
the billing model that you're releasing, will

00:44:05.930 --> 00:44:11.240
it support variable recurring, recurring based
upon usage as an example.

00:44:11.240 --> 00:44:17.780
&gt;&gt; KAY: So, we definitely think that lots
of billing mechanisms are going to be critical

00:44:17.780 --> 00:44:25.320
and important for the web. Subscription systems
and app payment, you know, group, bulk purchases,

00:44:25.320 --> 00:44:30.060
these are all things we want to do. At this
time, I don't know if we have timelines for

00:44:30.060 --> 00:44:33.220
exactly what's going to rule out when, which
functionality is going to be there.

00:44:33.220 --> 00:44:36.640
&gt;&gt; But in your first release, will there be
a form or recurring?

00:44:36.640 --> 00:44:40.541
&gt;&gt; KAY: Like I said, at this point, we don't
know from a timeline perspective, from a rule

00:44:40.541 --> 00:44:46.581
out perspective, which payment options are
going to be end yet. So, we'll, you know,

00:44:46.581 --> 00:44:49.750
try to get that information out as quickly
as we can but we're still working through

00:44:49.750 --> 00:44:51.180
it.
&gt;&gt; Okay. Thanks.

00:44:51.180 --> 00:44:54.320
&gt;&gt; KAY: Uh-hmm.
&gt;&gt; So, hopefully, you'll be available at office

00:44:54.320 --> 00:44:56.480
hours because I have a number of questions
but...

00:44:56.480 --> 00:45:01.510
&gt;&gt; KAY: Sure. There are office hours for Chrome,
just upstairs. Actually, they've already started

00:45:01.510 --> 00:45:04.870
now, so it's from now until, I don't know,
four or something.

00:45:04.870 --> 00:45:08.300
&gt;&gt; Awesome. But the one question then I think
could actually be more valuable for like an

00:45:08.300 --> 00:45:15.980
audience maybe here is in handling issues
regarding transitions into the store front.

00:45:15.980 --> 00:45:19.150
Say for instance some already have a webpage.
Man, as you said, the one of the big features

00:45:19.150 --> 00:45:23.560
of this is that you're existing site is an
essence, an application. And a lot of users

00:45:23.560 --> 00:45:25.610
are going to, want to be able to utilize the
functionality such as the little icons in

00:45:25.610 --> 00:45:35.220
the upper left and the easy extension, sorry,
the easy capability automatic allowing, et

00:45:35.220 --> 00:45:41.470
cetera. But if the users already been using
our site and is already paid for it, in essence,

00:45:41.470 --> 00:45:45.080
because we've been using existing payment
models. Is there going to be some mechanism

00:45:45.080 --> 00:45:50.210
by which we can tell you this list of Google
account should be authorized to apps that

00:45:50.210 --> 00:45:53.750
people don't feel almost like, oh, I should
have waited that extra month to get the app

00:45:53.750 --> 00:45:56.390
once it hit the Chrome stores because now
I'm never going to get that icon.

00:45:56.390 --> 00:46:01.240
&gt;&gt; KAY: Sure, sure. I could totally see the
use-case you're talking about. That's a great

00:46:01.240 --> 00:46:07.560
idea, it's a great suggestion and we, that's
kind of a feedback we're looking for. So I

00:46:07.560 --> 00:46:12.830
think the best thing I could suggest on that
front is to get involved in the mailing list,

00:46:12.830 --> 00:46:18.490
the discussion so toss it out there, or even
file a bug directly, we'll, and because, you

00:46:18.490 --> 00:46:22.560
know, that's the kind of feedback that's going
to help us really make this great and, you

00:46:22.560 --> 00:46:24.350
know, by launch time.
&gt;&gt; All right, thank you.

00:46:24.350 --> 00:46:26.370
&gt;&gt; KAY: Uh-hmm.
&gt;&gt; I was just wondering if you could speak

00:46:26.370 --> 00:46:29.730
to the experience that the user will have
when they're downloading the app and then

00:46:29.730 --> 00:46:34.720
I guess it would be like Android, you say
to them, hey, we want to know your location,

00:46:34.720 --> 00:46:37.880
we'd like to store offline data and then they
click that one time what you did basically

00:46:37.880 --> 00:46:43.860
to bypass that. Is it going to be like the
Android phone or perhaps you could just describe

00:46:43.860 --> 00:46:47.510
that experience.
&gt;&gt; KAY: Sure. So, we actually want the security--well...

00:46:47.510 --> 00:46:52.280
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; KAY: There's two answers to that, so one

00:46:52.280 --> 00:46:57.270
is you can look at how the extension systems
works today if you've installed the Chrome

00:46:57.270 --> 00:47:01.870
extension. And in some ways, yeah, it does
behave similarly to the Android model where

00:47:01.870 --> 00:47:06.490
there's a set of capabilities that it takes
advantage of and it says those upfront at

00:47:06.490 --> 00:47:13.000
install time. However, we actually think that
in many ways, the permissions that we're talking

00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:19.520
about for web apps are inherently a bit more
safe than the extension system. And so we

00:47:19.520 --> 00:47:25.150
want to make it an even lighter weight system
for granting those permissions. So, the permissions

00:47:25.150 --> 00:47:30.711
will likely be, you know, part of gallery
of listing page prominently displayed, but

00:47:30.711 --> 00:47:34.920
aren't necessarily going to be part of the
direct install flow. As you saw right there

00:47:34.920 --> 00:47:38.990
it was, essentially, aside from confirming
the account, it was really a one click thing

00:47:38.990 --> 00:47:43.450
to get it in there and we didn't, don't want
to really interrupt that unless it's really

00:47:43.450 --> 00:47:49.070
necessary. So if there's higher and security
features are permission that they need then

00:47:49.070 --> 00:47:53.411
we'll start looking back at it. But, for now,
the ones that we're looking at, I think, are,

00:47:53.411 --> 00:48:05.650
can be handled by the gallery by itself.
&gt;&gt; The payment question. Do you have any plans

00:48:05.650 --> 00:48:06.840
to allow alternative billing relationships
between a developer and a consumer, or do

00:48:06.840 --> 00:48:12.730
you have plans to make the checkout manager?
&gt;&gt; KAY: Right, that's a great question. And,

00:48:12.730 --> 00:48:17.580
I, unfortunately, I can't give you a good
answer on that right now. A lot of the--I

00:48:17.580 --> 00:48:23.330
know this could be, this is kind of a frustrating
non-answer but, a lot of the details about

00:48:23.330 --> 00:48:28.900
the payment mechanisms and the legal agreements
and the contracts and all that stuff are,

00:48:28.900 --> 00:48:34.320
we're too really on to get commitments. We
definitely have ideas and, you know, but,

00:48:34.320 --> 00:48:38.710
how we wanted to go but until we get them
a little further along, it's probably not

00:48:38.710 --> 00:48:44.430
a good idea to, you know, share have finished
ideas. And, so, we're going to try our best

00:48:44.430 --> 00:48:55.420
to get you the answers as quickly as we can
but, you know, keep an eye out for that.

00:48:55.420 --> 00:48:58.080
&gt;&gt; All right. For, you know, mobile apps there's,
you know, everybody knows go to an apps store

00:48:58.080 --> 00:49:03.100
App Store or a market to go get the apps.
But, for a browser, you know, for Chrome App

00:49:03.100 --> 00:49:09.850
Store apps or which are accessible otherwise
also. So, how do you ensure like, you know,

00:49:09.850 --> 00:49:19.340
people get directed to the Chrome App Store
for that? Or like what could happen if I directly

00:49:19.340 --> 00:49:22.660
go the website instead of discovering through
the Chrome store.

00:49:22.660 --> 00:49:26.980
&gt;&gt; KAY: Sure.
&gt;&gt; And then, how will the purchasing experience

00:49:26.980 --> 00:49:31.680
then extend to other browsers? You know that's
one detail we're also missing.

00:49:31.680 --> 00:49:37.710
&gt;&gt; KAY: Sure. So, I'll take the first one,
first part first. I think to some degree how

00:49:37.710 --> 00:49:46.041
your app behaves when a user comes in who
hasn't necessarily bought the app yet is kind

00:49:46.041 --> 00:49:49.170
of, is going to be up to the app developer
to figure out exactly what they want. We're

00:49:49.170 --> 00:49:54.410
definitely going to have a way to link back
in until like say, okay, you're now in the

00:49:54.410 --> 00:49:58.420
app and we want to have you be able to complete
the transaction. Say I have tried the app

00:49:58.420 --> 00:50:03.450
but I like it now I want to buy it and have
that full through into the store, but how

00:50:03.450 --> 00:50:08.840
that's going work exactly? We're not ready
to go into details yet. The second part of

00:50:08.840 --> 00:50:17.360
our purchasing in another browsers; I think
that we're definitely open to that that idea.

00:50:17.360 --> 00:50:22.050
And but I can't speak for the other browsers.
Some of it involves just the stuff that they

00:50:22.050 --> 00:50:27.300
would need to implement in their browsers
and we'd certainly want to encourage that

00:50:27.300 --> 00:50:32.550
and want to work with them to like help make
that happen. But, we're in, just starting

00:50:32.550 --> 00:50:37.000
our discussions with them about, you know,
how this is all going to work and what the

00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:41.600
format should exactly look like and if they're
even on board with the idea and the whole.

00:50:41.600 --> 00:50:48.220
So, until we have more to share on that, you
know, it has to come from, would love to hear

00:50:48.220 --> 00:50:49.839
what they say, I guess, is the short answer
for that.

00:50:49.839 --> 00:50:57.770
&gt;&gt; Can you speak about the, about integrating
with Google App Engine which you have to do

00:50:57.770 --> 00:51:04.110
with licensing server.
&gt;&gt; KAY: Sure. So, you're talking about the

00:51:04.110 --> 00:51:07.060
enterprise apps marketplace?
&gt;&gt; Yeah, you mentioned there had to be some

00:51:07.060 --> 00:51:13.340
Glue in the backend.
&gt;&gt; KAY: Yeah, it's a good question. So, the

00:51:13.340 --> 00:51:19.220
enterprise apps marketplace is definitely
serving sort of a different need, a different

00:51:19.220 --> 00:51:24.440
goal. The, you know, it's more about, you
know, organizations who are using apps for

00:51:24.440 --> 00:51:30.890
your domain. You know, I want integration
with Google Apps. And, we're on the flipside

00:51:30.890 --> 00:51:33.960
trying to aim more at consumers, you know,
finding...

00:51:33.960 --> 00:51:38.250
&gt;&gt; Oh, sorry, I'm not talking about the enterprise,
I'm talking about Google App Engine, so if

00:51:38.250 --> 00:51:42.630
I want to make an app for just regular users
not in an enterprise domain.

00:51:42.630 --> 00:51:48.810
&gt;&gt; KAY: Oh, so, but, yeah, having the App
Engine integrate with the license server,

00:51:48.810 --> 00:51:55.580
we want to make that as easy as we can, and
for sure. And, you can pretty much rest assure

00:51:55.580 --> 00:52:00.960
that there's going to be sample code and stuff
built-in. I mean, ideally, we'd love to make

00:52:00.960 --> 00:52:05.180
it even just sort of a one click thing of
like package up my app and have a wizard that

00:52:05.180 --> 00:52:09.470
gives you like here, okay, you're missing
this icon and here's your, which URL do you

00:52:09.470 --> 00:52:13.391
want to start at and what, you know, and have
it all be a one stop thing where you can just

00:52:13.391 --> 00:52:18.620
configure it and go. But, again, that's wishlist
and I can't say timing wise when that's going

00:52:18.620 --> 00:52:27.300
to exactly happen. But, there, certainly will
be sample code out there that will be easy

00:52:27.300 --> 00:52:30.300
to integrate into App Engine.
&gt;&gt; Okay, thank you.

00:52:30.300 --> 00:52:35.990
&gt;&gt; So, I have two questions. The first one
is the, if you're making a device that has

00:52:35.990 --> 00:52:40.560
device value that doesn't meet the standards
yet. Would you, say that it's a better approach

00:52:40.560 --> 00:52:45.130
to try and put native client? And do web apps
that integrate with native client or to put

00:52:45.130 --> 00:52:48.200
Android on to that device and use the JavaScript
interface and do web apps and Android that

00:52:48.200 --> 00:52:52.400
will let you and then you build your native
capabilities as data are stored?

00:52:52.400 --> 00:52:56.010
&gt;&gt; KAY: I'm sorry. I didn't fully follow what
you were...

00:52:56.010 --> 00:52:59.900
&gt;&gt; So there seem to be two different approaches
here, the web, the Chrome approach. You put

00:52:59.900 --> 00:53:01.890
Chrome and native client on to the device...
&gt;&gt; KAY: Okay.

00:53:01.890 --> 00:53:09.410
&gt;&gt; ...and get native capabilities in to web
apps that way or to put Android onto a device

00:53:09.410 --> 00:53:16.300
and use Android, the web view package in Android
has add JavaScript interface which lets you

00:53:16.300 --> 00:53:20.520
basically transmit and tend some activities...
&gt;&gt; KAY: Uh-ha.

00:53:20.520 --> 00:53:24.220
&gt;&gt; ...from Java domain into JavaScript and
that...

00:53:24.220 --> 00:53:30.570
&gt;&gt; KAY: Sure. Well, I mean, I'll just caveat
this by saying that I'm not an Android developer

00:53:30.570 --> 00:53:38.190
so, I don't know necessarily all that much
about what they're doing. But, what we're

00:53:38.190 --> 00:53:41.590
talking about is, you know, primarily web
applications, right? And so these are things

00:53:41.590 --> 00:53:46.661
that, if they run in Chrome, you know, then
we can, you know, well, you can list them

00:53:46.661 --> 00:53:52.640
on the store and sell them that way. Now,
there are advantages to building native apps,

00:53:52.640 --> 00:53:59.160
right, on the device. And if you're aiming
at, you know, a mobile phone, you know, a

00:53:59.160 --> 00:54:02.840
particular, an Android, maybe you want to
build an Android app. I guess, it depends

00:54:02.840 --> 00:54:08.390
on your goal. If you're trying to hit a wide
variety of devices, something which will run,

00:54:08.390 --> 00:54:14.600
you know, on different OSs and different browsers.
Take advantage of, you know, larger screens

00:54:14.600 --> 00:54:19.760
and desktops and whatever then, you know,
Chrome and Chrome apps, web, I mean, web apps

00:54:19.760 --> 00:54:25.180
for Chrome, you know, that's going to be more
what you want. So, I guess, it's hard to answer

00:54:25.180 --> 00:54:31.070
your answer because it's so apps specific
about what it is that you need, what your

00:54:31.070 --> 00:54:34.390
capabilities are.
&gt;&gt; So the goal, the goal is probably to build

00:54:34.390 --> 00:54:37.800
the most future proof platform for...
&gt;&gt; KAY: Sure.

00:54:37.800 --> 00:54:38.800
&gt;&gt; ...delivering applications across the heterogeneous
ecosystem.

00:54:38.800 --> 00:54:42.433
&gt;&gt; KAY: Sure. Well, I've got my own opinions
about what that would be and, but, I'm sure

00:54:42.433 --> 00:54:43.740
the Android people would have like their own
opinions as well.

00:54:43.740 --> 00:54:44.740
&gt;&gt; Maybe we should talk about this in the
Sandbox because my next question was about

00:54:44.740 --> 00:54:46.630
security models for native client integrated
into...

00:54:46.630 --> 00:54:49.180
&gt;&gt; KAY: Sure.
&gt;&gt; ...and that, again...

00:54:49.180 --> 00:54:57.900
&gt;&gt; KAY: Okay, yeah, we could talk afterwards.
&gt;&gt; Hi, hello.

00:54:57.900 --> 00:55:05.960
&gt;&gt; KAY: Yup.
&gt;&gt; Do you have applications in .net that are

00:55:05.960 --> 00:55:12.640
enterprise? And we're thinking about making
a small basic version of that for the, using

00:55:12.640 --> 00:55:17.210
the Google platform, and we want to give it
at the same looking field. How do you suggest

00:55:17.210 --> 00:55:22.560
we go about doing that?
&gt;&gt; KAY: Well, without seeing your app it's,

00:55:22.560 --> 00:55:26.630
okay, basically, the question was I've got
a native app and, you know, .net app and how

00:55:26.630 --> 00:55:32.760
do I make it as polished as, you know, using
the web? And, without seeing your app, you

00:55:32.760 --> 00:55:36.910
know, I can't give specific advice.
&gt;&gt; It's actually in a, it's a web based app

00:55:36.910 --> 00:55:40.950
in .net.
&gt;&gt; KAY: Oh, okay. So, when you say a web based

00:55:40.950 --> 00:55:43.730
app in .net, you mean, the server side is
.net or...?

00:55:43.730 --> 00:55:48.231
&gt;&gt; Yeah, on the server side is .net.
&gt;&gt; KAY: Sure. Well, with--so, the server side

00:55:48.231 --> 00:55:53.170
shouldn't impact the client look and fell.
You should be able to use all of the CSS,

00:55:53.170 --> 00:56:04.330
you know, all of the HTML5 tags you need from
ASP.NET. So, I would say just, you know, take

00:56:04.330 --> 00:56:08.760
a look into some of the latest CSS standards,
from the latest HTML5 stuff. There's a really

00:56:08.760 --> 00:56:14.790
organized online book, Dive Into HTML5, for
example, as a good primer on some of the basics

00:56:14.790 --> 00:56:19.250
there. There are a lot of great tutorials
out there by using the video tag and using--it

00:56:19.250 --> 00:56:28.020
depends on your app. But, there's, I'd also
recommend to go check out the presentation

00:56:28.020 --> 00:56:33.390
that I mentioned earlier, that happened yesterday
about there's an HTML5 presentation that sort

00:56:33.390 --> 00:56:37.780
of, that actually shows it from this perspective
of how do I make an apps that's really great,

00:56:37.780 --> 00:56:43.119
it looks really polished that looks like a
native app, and has a lot of the cool features.

00:56:43.119 --> 00:56:46.620
And, so there's could video that posted if
you missed it, so.

00:56:46.620 --> 00:56:51.460
&gt;&gt; Can we also interface with our database
using the Google Chrome web store?

00:56:51.460 --> 00:56:54.470
&gt;&gt; KAY: I'm not sure what you mean by your
database.

00:56:54.470 --> 00:57:00.321
&gt;&gt; We have a database already in SQL for the
enterprise app, can we link when we make the

00:57:00.321 --> 00:57:03.310
Google...
&gt;&gt; KAY: So the web app doesn't change. Your,

00:57:03.310 --> 00:57:08.450
if your web app talks to database, it's the
same web app. So, it's just a little bit of

00:57:08.450 --> 00:57:13.700
extra Glue to make it an installable web app,
but the web app itself if exactly the same.

00:57:13.700 --> 00:57:20.170
So if it can talk to the database today, that's
fine. And as an enterprise app, you know,

00:57:20.170 --> 00:57:24.850
it means that, you know, when the user downloads
it presumably there's some, you know, configuration

00:57:24.850 --> 00:57:31.210
that's going to be needed--maybe we should
talk offline about that, okay.

00:57:31.210 --> 00:57:33.330
&gt;&gt; Okay, thanks.
&gt;&gt; KAY: Yup.

00:57:33.330 --> 00:57:39.540
&gt;&gt; Hi, I got two questions; the first one
is going to be the easy one. Are you guys

00:57:39.540 --> 00:57:45.690
are going to take a cut of the purchases to
the web store?

00:57:45.690 --> 00:57:53.380
&gt;&gt; KAY: So, basically, I think the answer
to that right now is we're going to be very

00:57:53.380 --> 00:57:58.590
similar to what you're seeing in another web
store, another app stores out there. I'm hesitating

00:57:58.590 --> 00:58:03.510
this because we don't have specific numbers
to share right now but, you can expect similar

00:58:03.510 --> 00:58:08.150
arrangement to what's coming out there.
&gt;&gt; Okay. So, second a little bit complicated.

00:58:08.150 --> 00:58:16.270
Is there a DRM model? If so, is it client,
web apps encrypted client side or is it server

00:58:16.270 --> 00:58:23.670
side so you do that somewhere around. So I'm,
basically, you know, could someone just copy

00:58:23.670 --> 00:58:32.110
the web app and essentially, really what do
you are selling? Are you just selling basically

00:58:32.110 --> 00:58:36.920
the traffic like...?
&gt;&gt; KAY: Sure. So, DRM is on the server side.

00:58:36.920 --> 00:58:41.490
So basically the licensing--your web app will
talk to our licensed server to verify that

00:58:41.490 --> 00:58:47.020
this user has, in fact, you know, bought the
app and so that that you know that. I think

00:58:47.020 --> 00:58:53.170
that, you know, for pure like, it's possible
the package-up things are purely offline like

00:58:53.170 --> 00:59:00.550
extensions for example. And for those, you
know, the, any kind of protection we put in,

00:59:00.550 --> 00:59:05.869
is likely to be along the lines of keeping
honest people honest as opposed to like some

00:59:05.869 --> 00:59:11.380
massively complicated, you know, DRM system.
Our general take especially as an open source

00:59:11.380 --> 00:59:18.560
project is that, you know, complicated DRM
doesn't work. And that, you know, people who

00:59:18.560 --> 00:59:24.040
want to bypass it, can bypass it. So, the
idea is if you do anything on that front is

00:59:24.040 --> 00:59:31.790
to make is so it's a simple hurdle so that
people know that they are copying against

00:59:31.790 --> 00:59:37.390
your intentions. And that as long as that's
the case, then the people who are going to

00:59:37.390 --> 00:59:42.120
bypass it anyway, will do so. The people who
say, oh, I didn't realize what...

00:59:42.120 --> 00:59:46.869
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I get that so on the server side,
we're going have some kind of server to hit,

00:59:46.869 --> 00:59:48.500
to authenticate the client...
&gt;&gt; KAY: That's right.

00:59:48.500 --> 00:59:56.550
&gt;&gt; ...for using it and that, would that be
tied to the browser or to an account or unique

00:59:56.550 --> 00:59:59.922
ID or...&gt;
&gt;&gt; KAY: Basically, it'd be tied to a user

00:59:59.922 --> 01:00:05.060
ID of some kind. So, well, the license server,
we don't have a lot of details to share right

01:00:05.060 --> 01:00:09.260
now but it's going to be based on, you know,
open standards. Things like OAuth and OpenID,

01:00:09.260 --> 01:00:16.410
so there would be some user token behind that.
&gt;&gt; All right. Thank you.

01:00:16.410 --> 01:00:21.150
&gt;&gt; KAY: Uh-hmm. All right. It looks like we're
out of time here anyway. So, no more questions?

01:00:21.150 --> 01:00:22.620
But thank you all for coming.
