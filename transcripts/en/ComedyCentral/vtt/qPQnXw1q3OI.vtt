00:00:01.634 --> 00:00:04.237
I'm here at beautiful...

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:06.806
I don't know where.
Beats the hell out of me.

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:10.243
But my guest tonight is
a New York Daily News columnist

00:00:10.276 --> 00:00:12.178
and CNN contributor.

00:00:12.211 --> 00:00:14.547
Her new show,
 S.E. Cupp Unfiltered,

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.717
premieres July 17 on HLN.

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:19.619
Please welcome S.E. Cupp.

00:00:19.652 --> 00:00:22.889
-(cheers and applause) -Nice
to see you. Nice to see you.

00:00:22.922 --> 00:00:24.590
(mumbles)
Yeah.

00:00:24.623 --> 00:00:25.892
Yes.

00:00:25.925 --> 00:00:27.460
(clearing her throat)

00:00:27.493 --> 00:00:30.730
Now you're a Republican,
and Jeb Bush

00:00:30.763 --> 00:00:33.699
and Marco Rubio
both criticized me this week.

00:00:33.732 --> 00:00:36.402
Should more Republicans
be standing up to me,

00:00:36.435 --> 00:00:38.071
or should they shut up?

00:00:38.104 --> 00:00:40.840 line:0%
You know, I'd-I'd love it
if more Republicans

00:00:40.873 --> 00:00:44.243 line:0%
and conservatives took a stand
against the things

00:00:44.276 --> 00:00:48.848 line:0%
they believed in, not less than,
you know, 200 days ago.

00:00:48.881 --> 00:00:50.850
It's been pretty disappointing

00:00:50.883 --> 00:00:54.053
to see
how the party has unified,

00:00:54.086 --> 00:00:56.022
not around their principles,

00:00:56.055 --> 00:00:58.391
but around having an "R"
in the White House.

00:00:58.424 --> 00:00:59.725
Isn't that wonderful?

00:00:59.758 --> 00:01:02.128
No. My name's "T."
It's "T," not "R."

00:01:02.161 --> 00:01:03.796
My mistake.

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:04.931
Well, do you think it's because

00:01:04.964 --> 00:01:06.532
they care
about maintaining control

00:01:06.565 --> 00:01:09.469
in a party system
that's so partisan

00:01:09.502 --> 00:01:13.072
that it actually counteracts the
ability for people to govern?

00:01:13.105 --> 00:01:15.808
-Uh...
-(laughter)

00:01:15.841 --> 00:01:18.211
I think they're-they're
certainly interested

00:01:18.244 --> 00:01:21.114
in-in keeping control
and keeping a majority.

00:01:21.147 --> 00:01:23.616
The problem is,
what have they really been able

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:25.251
to do with this majority?

00:01:25.284 --> 00:01:26.819
Uh, not a whole lot.

00:01:26.852 --> 00:01:29.255
You'd think that having
nearly every lever of power

00:01:29.288 --> 00:01:31.357
in Washington,
you'd be able to get--

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:33.426
-I don't know--
health care passed. -We did.

00:01:33.459 --> 00:01:35.428
You've only got seven years
to work on it.

00:01:35.461 --> 00:01:37.463
-Oh, we totally did it.
We did it. -Yeah.

00:01:37.496 --> 00:01:39.332
-Didn't you see? I went
in the Rose Garden. -Uh-huh.

00:01:39.365 --> 00:01:42.201
And I said my catchphrase,
which I normally only say

00:01:42.234 --> 00:01:43.803
on the television show--

00:01:43.836 --> 00:01:45.438
"I'm the president.
You can believe it?"

00:01:45.471 --> 00:01:47.140
(laughter)

00:01:47.173 --> 00:01:50.009
You wrote an article called
"Our Endless Stream of Scandal."

00:01:50.042 --> 00:01:51.511
Is that...?

00:01:51.544 --> 00:01:54.013
Did you watch all of Scandal on
Netflix and just lost your mind?

00:01:54.046 --> 00:01:55.748
Yeah.

00:01:55.781 --> 00:01:58.985
So, how do we parse all
the messes that I'm involved in?

00:01:59.018 --> 00:02:00.753
Yeah. Well, there's a lot,

00:02:00.786 --> 00:02:04.090
and there's a lot of legitimate
controversies and scandals

00:02:04.123 --> 00:02:06.626
that we as a press
and we as a public

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.694
and we as a legislature

00:02:08.727 --> 00:02:11.531
should be looking at
very seriously, and we are.

00:02:11.564 --> 00:02:15.234
But there's also some
distracting non-scandals,

00:02:15.267 --> 00:02:18.304
like you swatting your wife's
hand away on a foreign trip.

00:02:18.337 --> 00:02:19.605
I was waving at her.

00:02:19.638 --> 00:02:22.175
-Not a story. -I was waving
at her, but really low.

00:02:22.208 --> 00:02:23.609
Right.

00:02:23.642 --> 00:02:26.145
I think when media outlets,

00:02:26.178 --> 00:02:28.481
serious and credible
media outlets,

00:02:28.514 --> 00:02:31.717
uh, create an equivalency
between that non-story

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:34.420
and real issues
that are troubling,

00:02:34.453 --> 00:02:36.822
it's no wonder
why people hate the media

00:02:36.855 --> 00:02:38.558
and feel like
they can't trust us.

00:02:38.591 --> 00:02:40.193
-Fake news.
-Right.

00:02:40.226 --> 00:02:42.695
Fake news.
Isn't it true that that problem,

00:02:42.728 --> 00:02:45.765
that generally people have
at a level

00:02:45.798 --> 00:02:47.533
that's almost underneath
their consciousness,

00:02:47.566 --> 00:02:50.937
of the fact that mainstream
media, at this point,

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:54.540
is a scandal-to-scandal
breaking-news collage,

00:02:54.573 --> 00:02:58.077
has created a problem in which
real stories get covered up

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:01.347
-by exactly what you're saying,
this type of scandal... -Mm-hmm.

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:04.283
and then I can come in,
label it fake news,

00:03:04.316 --> 00:03:05.952
and rob us of a real dialogue

00:03:05.985 --> 00:03:09.422
about the responsibilities
of the fourth estate?

00:03:09.455 --> 00:03:12.725
(applause, whooping)

00:03:12.758 --> 00:03:15.228 line:0%
Yeah, the fake news thing
is a... is a problem,

00:03:15.261 --> 00:03:17.797 line:0%
and as a, you know,
a member of the media,

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:20.132 line:0%
I find that to be
really, really unfair.

00:03:20.165 --> 00:03:22.768 line:0%
However,
if you're a news consumer,

00:03:22.801 --> 00:03:25.571 line:0%
it's hard to tell the difference
between "not news"

00:03:25.604 --> 00:03:26.939 line:0%
and "fake news."

00:03:26.972 --> 00:03:30.576
And I'm concerned that
when media outlets focus

00:03:30.609 --> 00:03:33.613
on the "not news,"
then the news viewer

00:03:33.646 --> 00:03:36.716
will have a very difficult time
telling the difference.

00:03:36.749 --> 00:03:38.985
You're a very likable
conservative,

00:03:39.018 --> 00:03:41.387
and I'm a very unlikable
conservative.

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:42.922
Also not a conservative.

00:03:42.955 --> 00:03:45.558
-Excuse me, I'm so conservative.
-(laughs): I don't think so.

00:03:45.591 --> 00:03:47.260
Well, you know,
that's really great.

00:03:47.293 --> 00:03:49.262
Why am I not a conservative?

00:03:49.295 --> 00:03:51.163 line:0%
Uh, I don't think you have

00:03:51.196 --> 00:03:53.466 line:0%
any undergirding
conservative principles.

00:03:53.499 --> 00:03:55.635 line:0%
Oh, I've got undergirding,
trust me.

00:03:55.668 --> 00:03:57.069
Trust me.

00:03:57.102 --> 00:03:58.504
Cinched tight.

00:03:58.537 --> 00:04:00.039
Bad word choice.

00:04:00.072 --> 00:04:01.874
You know, as you've said,
you know,

00:04:01.907 --> 00:04:04.277
you're not married
to a political party,

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:06.078
this is how you got elected.

00:04:06.111 --> 00:04:09.682
I think you wore the Republican
party like a rented tuxedo

00:04:09.715 --> 00:04:12.184
to get elected,
and it... and it worked.

00:04:12.217 --> 00:04:14.453
-Um, if...
-Thank you.

00:04:14.486 --> 00:04:18.491
It did, and I wish... I wish
you'd be a little less insecure.

00:04:18.524 --> 00:04:21.360
You won.
Stop, you know, obsessing

00:04:21.393 --> 00:04:23.763
about how,
or who didn't vote for you.

00:04:23.796 --> 00:04:26.065
Enough people liked you
to make you president,

00:04:26.098 --> 00:04:28.567
-so just do the job.
-Whatever, man.

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:31.103
Three million people
voted illegally,

00:04:31.136 --> 00:04:33.472
and if Hillary hadn't won
any of the votes,

00:04:33.505 --> 00:04:35.775
I would've gotten all of them.
You know that.

00:04:35.808 --> 00:04:37.476
-Right.
-That's the way it works.

00:04:37.509 --> 00:04:39.478
-Right.
-I have one last question.

00:04:39.511 --> 00:04:41.747
What are three places
where liberals and conservatives

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:43.983
can see eye to eye
with each other,

00:04:44.016 --> 00:04:48.354
if not agree, but at least
work towards understanding?

00:04:48.387 --> 00:04:51.991
Uh, today? Like, these 
liberals and conservatives?

00:04:52.024 --> 00:04:54.727
-Yeah.
-(laughs): Or... Geez.

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:56.962
It seems like, um...

00:04:56.995 --> 00:05:00.700
it seems difficult, honestly,
because we are so tribal

00:05:00.733 --> 00:05:02.935
and we are so encamped in our...

00:05:02.968 --> 00:05:06.205
in our, uh,
political ideologies,

00:05:06.238 --> 00:05:10.876
and... the idea that we
can come together on causes

00:05:10.909 --> 00:05:12.745
seems almost nostalgic.

00:05:12.778 --> 00:05:15.047
And that's...
that's very disappointing.

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:17.817
But I have faith that
there are very good people

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:20.419
on both sides of the aisle--
I know some of them,

00:05:20.452 --> 00:05:22.688
um, in the House
and in the Senate--

00:05:22.721 --> 00:05:26.525
who, uh... if they can emerge
out of this morass,

00:05:26.558 --> 00:05:29.328
uh, at some point,
will be able to...

00:05:29.361 --> 00:05:32.098
to work together on...
on some of those...

00:05:32.131 --> 00:05:35.067
those causes that used
to unite both of our parties

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:37.169
-not that long ago.
-I have an idea

00:05:37.202 --> 00:05:39.171
of what's gonna unite
both parties.

00:05:39.204 --> 00:05:41.307
-Hmm?
-My impeachment.

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:43.976
S.E. Cupp, everybody. S.E. Cupp.

00:05:44.009 --> 00:05:47.342
-(cheering, applause)
-S.E., stand up for a second.
