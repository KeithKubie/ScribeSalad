[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.948 --> 00:00:08.610
Good morning, everyone.

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:09.110
I'm Andy.

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:11.000
I'm going to be talking
to you about scaling

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.420
to the next billion players.

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.340
I'm on the product marketing
team for Google Cloud Platform.

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:19.400
So mobile and cloud
are better together.

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.260
If you think of today's
most compelling apps,

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:30.070
whether it's Uber or Spotify,
Netflix, YouTube, or even Maps,

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:33.800
the most compelling content
treats client and cloud

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.140
as a single platform.

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:44.020
And nowhere is this more
dramatic than games.

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:46.460
And this is going
to date me, but I

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:49.480
spent 10 years of my adolescence
playing these multiuser

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:50.960
dimensions, multiuser dungeons.

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.640
We're talking 9,600 baud
modems dialing up to BBSs.

00:00:54.640 --> 00:01:00.010
And as modest as the user
interface was for these,

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:01.730
it's amazing how
much they got right.

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:05.220
It's amazing how much they
understood their medium.

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.120
Things like a very in-depth
community, a guild system,

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:13.570
precursor to modern
day MMOs, your identity

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:15.350
within the community
was a huge reason

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:17.680
for players to come back.

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.654
Live daily events-- some
of these were goofy.

00:01:19.654 --> 00:01:21.820
On Thanksgiving Day, they
had turkeys running around

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:22.860
where you could loot.

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.520
They would drop gold and armor.

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.040
But it was just text, and
admins could orchestrate

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.830
all of that on the server side.

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:35.500
And every day had something new
for players to come back to.

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:38.790
Very Minecraft-esque, an
infinite world of UGC.

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.690
I built a zone called
Valley of the Jedi Tower,

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:45.050
and 15 years later,
it still stands.

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:48.880
All the NPCs, mobs, gear,
all the room descriptions,

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:50.290
it's still there today.

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:52.170
And players,
non-engineers, being

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.830
able to put content
back into the game

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:57.720
was huge and was expected.

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:59.235
So I think you
guys get the idea.

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:07.050
Fast forward to today, it's
a different era for gaming.

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:10.259
The stats for this are
all over the place.

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:11.180
It's going to vary.

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:16.170
But one source, GSMA, puts 6
billion folks with smartphones

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.740
in the next four to five years.

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:21.130
These folks, coming
online for the first time,

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:24.300
they're doing it through these
Playstations in their pockets,

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.300
gaming great
devices, that's going

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:30.970
to be their first
experience with gaming.

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:33.720
And along the same theme,
the other side of the coin

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:38.800
is ubiquitous cloud
access, 4G connectivity,

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:43.310
broadband connectivity on the go
where, in developed countries,

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:47.391
we're talking 100% coverage
and, in developing countries,

00:02:47.391 --> 00:02:49.640
right at the tipping point
where the majority of folks

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:53.170
are going to have 4G coverage,
that combination of mobile

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:55.916
and cloud together is
going to make the player

00:02:55.916 --> 00:02:57.790
experience greater than
the sum of the parts.

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:03.155
I'm going to back up.

00:03:03.155 --> 00:03:05.530
If you were to take something
away from this short lining

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:09.340
talk, what Google Cloud
Platform is trying to do

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:16.030
is to enable these great
foundational gaming experiences

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:18.790
in a way where the complexity
doesn't cause the whole house

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:19.665
of cards to collapse.

00:03:19.665 --> 00:03:23.510
In other words, if you're
bringing the same complexity

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:25.900
from the olden days
to the new mediums,

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:29.160
you're bringing forth
all this baggage.

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:33.720
So the one idea to take away is
we succeed-- our north star--

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:37.190
success for us is if you're
able to focus on content.

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:40.980
Every waking second, focus on
content and not infrastructure.

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:44.020
And this is an eye chart,
but Google Cloud Platform

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:49.250
is a collection of
services and, really,

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:52.190
across compute,
storage, and analytics

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:55.140
we have a range of
abstractions, and the magic

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:57.110
is in choosing the
right abstraction.

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:02.000
Abstraction's like being able
to have something fully managed.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.290
It's hard to see here,
but, in this case,

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:08.140
you're just focusing on the
content of your game, the state

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:10.140
of your persistent game world.

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:14.840
You just have a blob of
content in one line of code.

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:19.420
It writes it globally
across all gaming platforms

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:20.990
you care about.

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:23.980
The mutation is heard, and via
callback, they know about it.

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:25.820
You don't have to manage
any infrastructure.

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:30.360
You don't have to spin up any
VMs, spin up any REST services.

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:32.190
It just works.

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:35.220
So across compute,
storage, and analytics,

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:38.310
we have these-- what we call
third wave services that

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:40.240
allow you to focus
on your content,

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:44.050
and mere mortals like myself,
scripters, can go and put

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:47.040
content into the game.

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:50.850
Realizing that not everyone can
start with wave three services,

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:53.470
you can have your
existing stack today,

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:57.165
have it run on top of Google's
world class infrastructure.

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:02.660
So Google Cloud Platform is
allowing you to take your stack

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:05.010
or using our cloud
native services

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:07.220
and run it on top of
Google's infrastructure.

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:09.980
With that, I'm at time.

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:12.703
And I'd like to invite
you to check out
