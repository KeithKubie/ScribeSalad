00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.070
BRIAN BUTTERWORTH: The first
patient that we tested

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:07.870
formally and in detail was
a woman who had kept the

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:11.850
accounts of the hotel
that her family ran.

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:15.270
But after a stroke which
affected her left hemisphere,

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:18.150
she was unable to deal with
numbers above four.

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.030
Any numbers in any way
we presented them.

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:24.780
I mean, if we gave her a word
for a number above four, she

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:28.190
wouldn't know whether it was
even a real word or not, let

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:31.840
alone what it meant.

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:34.260
What was really interesting
for us was that everything

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:35.230
else seemed to be fine.

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:37.890
I mean, her language was fine,
she could understand what we

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.150
were saying perfectly well.

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:42.260
She could remember what she'd
had for breakfast.

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:43.570
She could reason.

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:45.230
We gave her lots of
reasoning tests.

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:46.510
She was absolutely fine.

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:48.010
She understood symbols.

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:50.250
So we gave her lots of different
sorts of symbols,

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.950
like traffic signs, political
party signs and so on.

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:55.650
Absolutely fine.

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:57.510
It was just numbers
that seemed to

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.770
be selectively affected.

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:02.550
So we thought, well, why
is it that numbers

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:03.740
are selectively affected?

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:08.560
Because the current theory at
that time including, the

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.360
theory that came from Chomsky
was really, numbers were just

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.290
an aspect of language.

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:17.660
That all the capacities that you
need for language kind of

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:21.480
automatically gave you numbers
as well, if you bothered to

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:22.280
learn them.

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.670
But here you had somebody whose
language was still fine,

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:29.000
but her numbers were really,
disastrously badly affected.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.660
So of course she couldn't
do her work anymore.

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:34.680
Then we found another patient
who seemed to have the

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:35.480
opposite problem.

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:38.120
Different kind of neurological
condition.

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:41.470
A kind of degenerative disease
that affected a different part

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:42.030
of the brain.

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.140
This affected the temporal lobes
rather than the parietal

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.760
lobes, which seem to be the
main areas for numbers.

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:50.980
This patient was--

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:54.260
language was disastrous,
completely disastrous.

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.700
If you gave him what we call a
picture pointer task, like

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:00.460
point to the orange,
he basically was

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:01.820
at chance at that.

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:05.500
And his speech was confined to
very stereotype phrases, just

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.460
a few stereotype phrases.

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:10.389
His memory for other sorts of
things seemed to be fine,

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:12.670
except what we call
semantic memory.

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:15.460
So he didn't, for example,
know that an

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:16.650
orange was a fruit.

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.810
However, his calculation
was superb.

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:21.630
If you gave it to him in
writing, he could do

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:25.480
multi-digit, multiplication and
division absolutely fine.

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:30.460
And what was even more
surprising to us was that

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:33.050
although his language was
terrible, he couldn't read

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:36.130
anymore, he couldn't write
anymore, if you asked him to

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:40.950
read number words like T-W-O
or E-I-G-H-T, he

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:42.640
could do that perfectly.

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.670
If you asked him to write these
words, remember, they're

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.360
very irregularly spelt.

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.680
There isn't another word in
English that gets consonant

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.180
W-O, it's pronounced "ooh."
He was absolutely perfect.

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:57.320
But on equivalent words which
weren't in the number domain

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:02.440
like flat or give, or take, he
couldn't read them and he

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:03.740
couldn't write them.

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:06.520
So we thought, well, there's
actually a separate system in

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:08.290
the brain for numbers.

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:11.000
And maybe for arithmetic
as well.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.810
And so that was really how we
got started in this area,

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:18.580
looking at these kind of
dissociations between the

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:20.965
number domain and other
domains of cognition.

00:03:20.965 --> 00:03:25.790
Our first paper in this area
was published in 1991.

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:27.830
It wasn't that long ago, no.

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:30.720
BRADY HARAN: Neuroscience is
quite an old science, though.

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:31.880
It's not like, brand new.

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:35.700
It seems extraordinary to me
that in the 1990s, people

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:39.060
still had no grasp of how we
were dealing with something as

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.670
fundamental as words
versus numbers.

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:43.970
BRIAN BUTTERWORTH: That's
absolutely right.

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:47.020
People were not really aware of
the difference between the

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:50.610
number domain of memory and
other domains of memory,

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:54.470
except that in the very early
part of the 20th century,

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:58.470
there was a Swedish neurologist
called Henshin,

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:02.560
who actually came to the same
conclusion that we did.

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:06.300
But although his work is often
referred to, it didn't seem to

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:09.470
generate a lot of new studies
in this area.

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:11.700
The left parietal lobe
seemed to be the

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:13.960
key area for numbers.

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:15.830
And if it was damaged,
then you've got

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:17.240
these selective deficits.

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:20.360
If it was preserved, you've
got preserved numerical

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:21.339
capacities.

00:04:21.339 --> 00:04:24.300
And if you did the imaging,
what you saw was that in

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:27.730
number tasks, this was the area
that was active when you

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:29.080
were doing the number tasks.

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:30.630
These are the parietal lobes.

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:32.320
These bits around here.

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:35.960
And although you do very simple
number tasks, like

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:39.730
estimate the number of objects
in an array, both in the left

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:42.780
and the right parietal, when
you're doing calculations,

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:45.500
it's mostly in the
left parietal.

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:48.640
So that area there seems
to be the part that's

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:50.500
critical for numbers.

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:52.480
The language areas,
they're here.

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:55.360
This is Wernicke's area, and
this is Broca's area around

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:56.420
about there.

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:59.290
So you can see that
anatomically,

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:00.410
they're rather separate.

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:02.920
BRADY HARAN: The thing that
you've said to me so far that

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:07.430
really strikes me is that my
brain could be damaged in such

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:12.140
a way that I can no longer
function very well with words,

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:16.750
but I will still recognize the
words for numbers, which makes

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:19.920
me think the words for numbers,
to me, aren't really

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:21.200
words at all.

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:22.630
Is that right?

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:28.580
Does my brain not process
E-I-G-H-T as a word?

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:30.500
Does it process it
as a number?

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:34.730
BRIAN BUTTERWORTH: Well, it
interprets it as a number.

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:41.010
So if you still know number
meanings, then you can process

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:45.940
E-I-G-H-T. So the neurological
patient who could read and

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:50.600
write E-I-G-H-T, but not a
word like G-A-V-E, gave--

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:52.560
although he had this
word in his brain.

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:55.900
We know he had the word in his
brain because we asked him to

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:59.790
say whether G-A-V-E
was a real word.

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:01.120
He would say yes, it is.

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:01.860
What does it mean?

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:02.800
He didn't know.

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:03.680
How do you pronounce it?

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:04.650
He couldn't do it.

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:05.420
Can you write it?

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:07.040
He couldn't write it.

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:09.350
It was in his brain, but
he didn't have an

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:11.190
interpretation for it.

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:15.530
So he only had interpretations
for number words.

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:18.020
So they were the words that
he could pronounce.

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:19.790
They were the words he
could understand.

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:22.420
The other words, although they
were still in his brain , he

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:24.950
couldn't do anything
with them.

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:26.790
BRADY HARAN: What do I
do for big numbers?

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:29.490
BRIAN BUTTERWORTH: Well, you
make an estimate which is

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:32.740
based on extracting
various visual

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:34.880
properties from the stimulus.

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:38.100
And there's now some brilliant
work done by Marco Zorzi's lab

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:42.130
in Italy, where they've modeled
how this might work.
