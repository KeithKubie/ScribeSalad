00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:18.290
While it’s likely others had tried it before,
the first surviving documented attempt of

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:22.270
someone trying to turn something to gold in
a (relatively) scientific fashion occurred

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:23.990
around 300 AD.

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:27.840
The proto-scientist in question was a Greco-Egyptian
named Zosimos.

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.430
During his lifetime, it’s thought that he
wrote nearly thirty books about alchemy, but

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:33.050
most of them have been lost to history.

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:37.320
What we do know is that in his work he focused
mainly on the use of vapors, specifically

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.390
sulfur vapors which do cause some things to
turn yellow.

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:44.570
For example, he found that when mixed with
liquid mercury, the resulting substance becomes

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:47.220
a yellow solid, but it wasn’t gold.

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:51.070
From there for nearly two thousand years famed
scientists like Isaac Newton, Roger Bacon,

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:55.380
Robert Boyle, and Jabir ibn Hayyan all tried
their hand at making gold.

00:00:55.380 --> 00:01:00.410
All failed, but did give the world numerous
other advancements as a result of their work.

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:06.630
As science historian Lawrence Principe noted
in 2014, they “were amazingly good experimentalists.”

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.460
This brings us to more modern times and one
of the most distinguished scientists of the

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:15.470
20th century you’ve probably never heard
of- Glenn T. Seaborg.

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:20.130
Seaborg was far from being a no-name chemist
with a crazy vision of turning lead into gold

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.509
when he decided to make the attempt in 1980.

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:27.350
For example, in 1941, he led the team that
first discovered/produced/isolated the element

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:28.350
plutonium.

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.280
This led to the United States pursuing a program
to make plutonium for use in their atomic

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.189
bomb project, which later morphed into the
top-secret Manhattan Project which Seaborg

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:38.189
also worked on.

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:39.189
(Although, along with many other scientists
who worked on the project, he strongly lobbied

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:43.759
for doing a public demonstration of a nuclear
explosion to show to Japan, rather than actually

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:45.140
using the bomb against them.)

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:49.609
All in all during his lifetime he helped discover
ten elements (via creating them in a lab),

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:53.659
which ultimately saw him receive a Nobel Prize
in chemistry in 1951.

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:59.289
He also discovered or helped isolate well
over 100 isotopes, most notably Iodine-131,

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:03.600
which if you’ve ever known someone with
certain thyroid diseases (including some types

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.999
of thyroid cancer), they may well still be
alive, or have had their life extended, thanks

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:09.530
to this one.

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:13.030
Along the way he became the chairman for the
Atomic Energy Commission, advising and working

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.780
for US Presidents Kennedy, Johnson, and Nixon.

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.840
During his time in that role, he successfully
lobbied for the nuclear test ban treaty prohibiting

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.300
the testing of nuclear devices in the atmosphere
or under the sea.

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:28.260
He also strongly advocated for increased funding
for science education in schools, better science

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.370
curriculum, and increased funding in pure
scientific research.

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:35.260
He’s also the only chemist in history to
have an element named after him while he was

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.129
still living- seaborgium.

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:40.610
This brings us to creating gold.

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:44.390
In 1980, the Seaborg and a group of other
scientists used a particle accelerator to

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:49.530
propel beams of carbon and neon nuclei at
nearly light speed into foils of the heavy

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:54.349
metal bismuth- you know, the stuff you find
in relatively large quantities in Peptol-Bismol,

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:58.180
used for shotgun pellets, and a variety of
other applications.

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:01.540
Why bismuth, rather than the originally planned
lead?

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.340
It is simply easier to isolate gold from bismuth
than it is from lead.

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:08.390
However, producing gold from lead would have
been no more difficult.

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:11.860
As for the result, when they were rifling
through the carnage that was the result of

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:16.019
the high speed collision between neon, carbon,
and bismuth, the physicists discovered the

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:18.520
they had successfully made several isotopes
of gold.

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:21.590
Of course, none of this was economical in
the slightest.

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:25.519
According to Seaborg, “It would cost more
than one quadrillion dollars per ounce to

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:27.579
produce gold by this experiment.”

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:31.609
The going rate for gold in 1980 was about
$590 an ounce…

00:03:31.609 --> 00:03:36.450
Still, regardless of cost, finally after at
least a couple thousand years of effort by

00:03:36.450 --> 00:04:06.829
some of the finest minds in history, a human
had finally created gold from

00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:44.789
something else.
