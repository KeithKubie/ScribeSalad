TIMOTHY JORDAN: Hello.

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:04.650
I'm Timothy Jordan, and
this is the first episode

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:06.960
of "The Developer's
Show" in 2017.

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.030
Remember to come back
every week for the latest

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.967
and coolest developer
news from Google.

00:00:11.967 --> 00:00:13.800
You can now start
building actions on Google

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:16.199
with the developer platform
for the Google Assistant.

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:17.490
It's super easy to get started.

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.940
Just head on over to the post
linked below for an intro video

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:22.430

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:24.150
Finding success
in global markets

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.580
means considering how
each market differs,

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.470
planning for high
quality localization,

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.740
and tailoring your activity
to the local audience.

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.680
This new "Going Global Playbook"
provides best practices

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.840

Grumpy is an experimental
Python runtime for Go.

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.160
It translates Python
code into Go programs,

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.290
and those transpiled
programs run seamlessly

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:50.794
within the Go Runtime.

00:00:50.794 --> 00:00:53.460
If you've been struggling to get
concurrent workloads to perform

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.450
well in Python or CPython,
Grumpy may be for you.

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:59.820

The Santa Tracker
app for Android

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.590
is a Google holiday tradition,
but a challenging one

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.200
to monitor and update.

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.270
See, it's live for a few
months each year, but about 90%

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.460
of the usage occurs in just two
weeks at the end of December.

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:23.370
Well, this year,
we used Firebase

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:25.140
to maintain a high
level of quality

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.630
without ever having
to republish the app.

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.660
All the details are on the post.

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:32.670

into cloud infrastructure

Data Center Professionals

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.310

who are looking

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.560

and experimentation in AdWords.

00:02:11.037 --> 00:02:12.870
It helps you understand
whether any proposed

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.360
changes to your account will
help you reach your business

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:16.290
