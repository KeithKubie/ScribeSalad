00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.670
in my main video I mentioned something

00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:01.680
in my main video I mentioned something
 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:03.200
in my main video I mentioned something
called the shortest split line method I

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:03.210
called the shortest split line method I
 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:05.480
called the shortest split line method I
really had to zoom past that because of

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:05.490
really had to zoom past that because of
 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:07.039
really had to zoom past that because of
time constraints but it's a very

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:07.049
time constraints but it's a very
 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:08.900
time constraints but it's a very
interesting way of dividing up voters

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910
interesting way of dividing up voters
 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:10.549
interesting way of dividing up voters
into boundaries into different districts

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559
into boundaries into different districts
 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:12.080
into boundaries into different districts
so I wanted to spend a little bit more

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090
so I wanted to spend a little bit more
 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.959
so I wanted to spend a little bit more
time going into depth with it here so

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969
time going into depth with it here so
 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:16.460
time going into depth with it here so
this is the sample population I used in

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470
this is the sample population I used in
 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.019
this is the sample population I used in
the main gerrymandering video there

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029
the main gerrymandering video there
 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:20.029
the main gerrymandering video there
about 40 voters here and I want to

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039
about 40 voters here and I want to
 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:21.230
about 40 voters here and I want to
divide them up into eight different

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240
divide them up into eight different
 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.720
divide them up into eight different
groups now when you have an easy number

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730
groups now when you have an easy number
 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.939
groups now when you have an easy number
it's a pretty simple thing to do you

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949
it's a pretty simple thing to do you
 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.320
it's a pretty simple thing to do you
find the line that divides them into two

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330
find the line that divides them into two
 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.450
find the line that divides them into two
equally populous groups and use the

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460
equally populous groups and use the
 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.189
equally populous groups and use the
shortest line if you have multiple lines

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199
shortest line if you have multiple lines
 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.319
shortest line if you have multiple lines
that will do the same thing there are 20

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329
that will do the same thing there are 20
 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:34.850
that will do the same thing there are 20
voters on the left and there's 20 voters

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860
voters on the left and there's 20 voters
 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.650
voters on the left and there's 20 voters
on the right then you take each of those

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660
on the right then you take each of those
 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.330
on the right then you take each of those
two groups and you do the same thing

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340
two groups and you do the same thing
 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.100
two groups and you do the same thing
again you find the shortest line that

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110
again you find the shortest line that
 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.720
again you find the shortest line that
will divide the two populations into

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730
will divide the two populations into
 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.030
will divide the two populations into
equal sized groups so now there's 10 in

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040
equal sized groups so now there's 10 in
 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.459
equal sized groups so now there's 10 in
each group and ultimately we want eight

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469
each group and ultimately we want eight
 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.260
each group and ultimately we want eight
voting ranges here so we divide them one

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270
voting ranges here so we divide them one
 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:48.680
voting ranges here so we divide them one
more time

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690
more time
 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.569
more time
then you end up with eight equally sized

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579
then you end up with eight equally sized
 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.900
then you end up with eight equally sized
ranges each with five votes and that's

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910
ranges each with five votes and that's
 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.160
ranges each with five votes and that's
the basics of the shortest split line

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170
the basics of the shortest split line
 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.139
the basics of the shortest split line
method just always use the shortest line

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149
method just always use the shortest line
 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.110
method just always use the shortest line
you can to divide the two groups but the

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120
you can to divide the two groups but the
 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.279
you can to divide the two groups but the
question that naturally comes up is what

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289
question that naturally comes up is what
 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:02.720
question that naturally comes up is what
if you have an odd number of districts

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730
if you have an odd number of districts
 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.640
if you have an odd number of districts
you want to divide them into seven

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650
you want to divide them into seven
 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.130
you want to divide them into seven
groups instead of into eight groups this

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140
groups instead of into eight groups this
 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.480
groups instead of into eight groups this
is where the cleverness of the shortest

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490
is where the cleverness of the shortest
 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.609
is where the cleverness of the shortest
split line method comes up is if you

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619
split line method comes up is if you
 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.230
split line method comes up is if you
take 7 divided by 2 you don't get a

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240
take 7 divided by 2 you don't get a
 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.289
take 7 divided by 2 you don't get a
round number you get 3.5 but what you do

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299
round number you get 3.5 but what you do
 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.630
round number you get 3.5 but what you do
is you take that 3.5 and you round it up

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640
is you take that 3.5 and you round it up
 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.170
is you take that 3.5 and you round it up
to get 4 and down to get 3 and this

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180
to get 4 and down to get 3 and this
 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.910
to get 4 and down to get 3 and this
tells you the ratio that you want to

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920
tells you the ratio that you want to
 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.679
tells you the ratio that you want to
draw the line app for the population so

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689
draw the line app for the population so
 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.210
draw the line app for the population so
you want to draw a line that divides the

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220
you want to draw a line that divides the
 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.480
you want to draw a line that divides the
population into a 4:3 ratio for every 4

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490
population into a 4:3 ratio for every 4
 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.520
population into a 4:3 ratio for every 4
voters in one group you want 3 voters in

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530
voters in one group you want 3 voters in
 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.590
voters in one group you want 3 voters in
the other group so as best I can tell

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600
the other group so as best I can tell
 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:34.999
the other group so as best I can tell
this is the shortest line that will

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009
this is the shortest line that will
 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.740
this is the shortest line that will
divide this population of voters into a

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750
divide this population of voters into a
 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.109
divide this population of voters into a
4:3 ratio unless there's double check

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119
4:3 ratio unless there's double check
 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.270
4:3 ratio unless there's double check
there's 24 voters on the left there are

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280
there's 24 voters on the left there are
 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.359
there's 24 voters on the left there are
18 voters on the right 24 divided by 18

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369
18 voters on the right 24 divided by 18
 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.969
18 voters on the right 24 divided by 18
gives us 1 point 3 and 4 divided by 3

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979
gives us 1 point 3 and 4 divided by 3
 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.100
gives us 1 point 3 and 4 divided by 3
gives us 1 point 3 we've drawn this line

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110
gives us 1 point 3 we've drawn this line
 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.590
gives us 1 point 3 we've drawn this line
in the right spot the next step is to

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600
in the right spot the next step is to
 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.810
in the right spot the next step is to
take that ratio that 4:3 ratio and that

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820
take that ratio that 4:3 ratio and that
 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.179
take that ratio that 4:3 ratio and that
actually tells you how many districts

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189
actually tells you how many districts
 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:57.709
actually tells you how many districts
you then want to divide each of these

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719
you then want to divide each of these
 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.959
you then want to divide each of these
separate groups into so on the left hand

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969
separate groups into so on the left hand
 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.670
separate groups into so on the left hand
side we want to take that group of

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680
side we want to take that group of
 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.590
side we want to take that group of
voters and divide them into four equally

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600
voters and divide them into four equally
 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.690
voters and divide them into four equally
sized groups now that's really easy to

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700
sized groups now that's really easy to
 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.880
sized groups now that's really easy to
do because we have an even number so we

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890
do because we have an even number so we
 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.380
do because we have an even number so we
find the shortest line to divide them

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390
find the shortest line to divide them
 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.229
find the shortest line to divide them
into two equal sized groups and then do

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239
into two equal sized groups and then do
 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:13.580
into two equal sized groups and then do
it once again

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590
it once again
 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:14.690
it once again
now we have our four groups on the Left

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700
now we have our four groups on the Left
 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.330
now we have our four groups on the Left
each of which has six voters inside of

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340
each of which has six voters inside of
 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.520
each of which has six voters inside of
it now to divide up the group that's on

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530
it now to divide up the group that's on
 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.229
it now to divide up the group that's on
the right we do the same thing that we

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:21.239
the right we do the same thing that we
 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:22.729
the right we do the same thing that we
did with the number seven take three

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:22.739
did with the number seven take three
 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:25.180
did with the number seven take three
divided by two you get one point five

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190
divided by two you get one point five
 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:27.470
divided by two you get one point five
round one point five up you get to

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480
round one point five up you get to
 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.600
round one point five up you get to
around one point five down you get one

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610
around one point five down you get one
 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.400
around one point five down you get one
so we want to divide that group into a

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410
so we want to divide that group into a
 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:33.800
so we want to divide that group into a
2:1 ratio finding the shortest line that

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810
2:1 ratio finding the shortest line that
 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:35.330
2:1 ratio finding the shortest line that
will do that should be this line we can

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340
will do that should be this line we can
 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.070
will do that should be this line we can
just double-check our math again there

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080
just double-check our math again there
 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:38.780
just double-check our math again there
are 12 voters in the top six voters in

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790
are 12 voters in the top six voters in
 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.570
are 12 voters in the top six voters in
the bottom 12 divided by 6 gives us 2 2

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580
the bottom 12 divided by 6 gives us 2 2
 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:43.460
the bottom 12 divided by 6 gives us 2 2
divided by 1 gives us 2 so we know we've

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470
divided by 1 gives us 2 so we know we've
 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.100
divided by 1 gives us 2 so we know we've
drawn that line in the correct spot and

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.110
drawn that line in the correct spot and
 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:47.390
drawn that line in the correct spot and
again that ratio tells us how many

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400
again that ratio tells us how many
 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.069
again that ratio tells us how many
districts we actually want to draw among

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:49.079
districts we actually want to draw among
 

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:50.900
districts we actually want to draw among
these remaining areas so that bottom one

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910
these remaining areas so that bottom one
 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:53.000
these remaining areas so that bottom one
is 1 we're done there right that has six

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010
is 1 we're done there right that has six
 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:54.170
is 1 we're done there right that has six
voters there's nothing more to do with

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180
voters there's nothing more to do with
 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.360
