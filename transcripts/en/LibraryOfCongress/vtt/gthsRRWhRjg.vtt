00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:03.970
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:20.720
&gt;&gt; Mark Sweeney: Good
evening, everyone.

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:24.500
I'm Mark Sweeney, the associate
librarian for Library Services.

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:28.070
And it's my pleasure to welcome
you to the Library of Congress

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:31.570 position:56%
for the Ninth Annual Kislak Lecture.

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:33.420
I would be remiss in starting

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.210
without first thanking Ralph
Ehrenberg and John Hessler for all

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:41.620
of their outstanding efforts in
organizing the conference today,

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:43.800
as well as this evening's lecture.

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:49.330
The Kislak Lecture is an integral
component of a program established

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:53.150
at the Library of Congress
in 2004, for the purpose

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:55.640
of fostering greater
understanding of the culture

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.450
and history of the Americas.

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:00.780
This multifaceted program
was made possible

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.710
through the generosity of the J. I.

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:04.670
Kislak Foundation.

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:08.480
I'm delighted that Mr. Kislak, who
is one of the Library's greatest

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:12.120
and most enlightened
benefactors, is here tonight.

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:15.510
Mr. Kislak, thank you
for being with us.

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:29.120
[ Applause ]

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:33.780
The centerpiece of the Kislak
gift is unique, extensive,

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.380
it's a supremely important
collection of books, manuscripts,

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.280
historical documents, maps,
and art of the Americas.

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.560
A permanent rotating
exhibition of materials

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.740
from the Kislak collection titled,

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:52.430
"Exploring the Early Americas"
opened here in December of 2007.

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:54.500
I think most of you
are familiar with it,

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.150
but if this is your first
visit to the Library,

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:02.720
I certainly encourage you to tour
the exhibition on the second floor.

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:07.780
I also want to point out that the
Kislak gift supports fellowships

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:10.140
for the study of the
materials in the collection.

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.660
And I must say it's been
very exciting to learn

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.890
about the many fresh insights
gained about the Kislak collection

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.860
through the efforts of
various fellows over the years.

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:24.760
Returning to the subject at hand,
which is the Annual Kislak Lecture,

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.300
I think it's safe to say that
it's one of the premier events

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.680
of its kind in the
field of cartography.

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.430
It is certainly one
of the highlights

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:34.040
of the year here at the Library.

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.880
Previous lecturers in the
Kislak series have included

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:42.670
such distinguished experts as Jared
Diamond, Felipe Fernandez-Armesto,

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:48.450
Michael Coe, Jonathan Spence,
David Stewart and Charles C. Mann.

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:51.760
Tonight, the Library of Congress
is fortunate once again to be able

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.120
to present an exciting
world-class speaker.

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.170
I will now turn to my colleague,
John Hessler, to introduce her.

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.510
John?

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:08.120
[ Applause ]

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:09.490
&gt;&gt; John Hessler: Thank you, Mark,
and thank you all for coming.

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:13.280
One of the great pleasures
of being the curator

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:18.520 position:56%
of the Kislak collection is not
only to get to study the collection,

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:20.990
interact with the scholars
who come here,

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:24.140
plan and work with our great
exhibits office to work

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:26.830
on the Exploring Early
Americas Exhibit,

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:31.640
but also to select a lecturer
for the annual lecture.

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:37.620
We've had a wide variety of
people speak to this audience.

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:40.460
And it's been on a wide
variety of subjects.

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:46.240
The Kislak Collection itself makes
us sort of rethink the history

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:48.640
of the early Americas,
due to the fact

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:53.150
that it has pre-Columbian
artifacts, postcolonial artifacts,

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:56.490
artifacts that sweep all
the way down from Florida

00:03:56.490 --> 00:04:00.900
down into Central America,
down all the way into Peru,

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:04.580
European writings on exploration.

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:07.260
So it makes us kind of
reconsider very broadly,

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.630
what is the early Americas?

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:11.010
How is it explored?

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:13.040
How did we find out about it?

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:17.720
And tonight, I have the special
pleasure of introducing Dava Sobel.

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:23.860 position:56%
Dava Sobel's writings, at least to
me, are some of the most fascinating

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:28.850
and most well-written science
writing that is being done today.

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:32.380
She has brought to audiences
all over the world in many,

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:39.750
many languages really complicated
themes, the longitude, Galileo,

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:43.580
themes that are revolutionary
in the history of science.

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:44.880
She doesn't dumb them down.

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:47.110
She writes narratives that
are extremely beautiful,

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:49.880
that make you feel the
excitement of discovery,

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:54.740
that make you feel the excitement
of scientific exploration.

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:59.050
Her new book is on the
women who actually worked

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:02.970
at the Harvard Observatory and
actually measured the distances

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:06.330
of the stars, which will
come out in the fall.

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:11.190
And so without further adieu, I
am going to give you Dava Sobel,

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:14.510
personally one of my
personal heroes.

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:25.080
[ Applause ]

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:26.380
&gt;&gt; Dava Sobel: Thank you very much.

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:29.750
It really is an honor
and a thrill to be here.

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:36.770
We spent much of today looking at
magnificent maps of land and sea.

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:41.140
And I want to talk to you
about maps of the sky,

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:44.940
especially the Southern Hemisphere.

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:55.420
Okay. So this is the
unprepossessing looking book.

00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:58.440
In a photograph, it
looks unprepossessing.

00:05:58.440 --> 00:05:59.830
I guess if it were really here

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:03.410
and we could see how big
it was, we would all gasp.

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:05.930
But this is the binding

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:12.800
that contained the two [inaudible]
mover maps, the globe gores,

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:19.170
and also the first
printed star chart.

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:22.970
And it's a star chart of
the Southern Hemisphere.

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:29.310
You might notice there's
a lot of empty space.

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:35.850
This is because the
information is really based

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:41.840 position:56%
on the ancient world knowledge, and
they hadn't traveled very far South.

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:45.780
But it's a very beautiful object.

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:49.960
It really evokes a period when art

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:55.930
and science were intimately
combined;

00:06:55.930 --> 00:06:58.360
exploration and imagination.

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:00.160
It's beautifully rendered.

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:05.560
But the positions of
the stars are accurate.

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:11.270
It was printed in 1515, and
there aren't many of them left.

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:17.870
Some of the few that survived have
been colored in, like this one,

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:23.060
to make it look even more exciting.

00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:27.500
But I actually prefer
the black and white,

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:32.190
because it's almost
like a treasure map.

00:07:32.190 --> 00:07:35.200
It's all promise of things to come.

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:41.330
And the Southern sky turned
out to be really different,

00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:47.200
and not just the question of
filling in the blanks on this map,

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:54.840
but discovering that the air
down there was clearer and drier,

00:07:54.840 --> 00:08:01.060
and there was less
light to get in the way.

00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:05.680
Light was already interfering
with observations

00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:08.300
of Northern observatories.

00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:14.060
So the Southern sky offered
something truly different.

00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:18.450
And there were objects
in the Southern sky

00:08:18.450 --> 00:08:21.270
that had no counterpart
in the North.

00:08:21.270 --> 00:08:24.520
And that really made the
difference in being able

00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:29.120
to track distances across space.

00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:36.920
So also in 1515, Ptolemy's
star charts were published.

00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:42.050
They weren't pictorial
like Ptolemy's geography.

00:08:42.050 --> 00:08:47.020
They were really instructions,
lists of locations.

00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:50.030
And these were widely used.

00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:53.140
He had 48 constellations.

00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:55.090
We have 88 today.

00:08:55.090 --> 00:08:57.460
But he described the positions

00:08:57.460 --> 00:09:01.470
of each very carefully
in this list format.

00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:08.330
And this is the first
real star atlas.

00:09:08.330 --> 00:09:14.840
It was by Alessandro Piccolomini,
and it came out in 1540.

00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:19.980
And the unusual thing about it
is that there are no pictures.

00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:25.850
It's just the position of the
stars, which are quite accurate.

00:09:25.850 --> 00:09:31.990
And he also had a technique for
showing which stars were brighter,

00:09:31.990 --> 00:09:35.200
this convention of drawing
the brightest stars larger

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:37.500
than the others.

00:09:40.420 --> 00:09:48.780 position:56%
So this is the Uranometria of Bayer.

00:09:48.780 --> 00:09:54.910
And it is one of the most
magnificent star atlases

00:09:54.910 --> 00:09:56.210
ever published.

00:09:56.210 --> 00:09:58.770
It was the first truly great one.

00:09:58.770 --> 00:10:01.390
It's beautifully illustrated.

00:10:01.390 --> 00:10:05.550
And the really -- one of the
most unusual things about it is

00:10:05.550 --> 00:10:10.470
that it contained this map of the
stars of the Southern Hemisphere.

00:10:10.470 --> 00:10:18.530 position:56%
So these are new constellations that
were discovered by Dutch traders

00:10:18.530 --> 00:10:21.910
on their way to the East Indies,

00:10:21.910 --> 00:10:26.320
and Bayer incorporated
them into the map.

00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:34.560
And he also had two little
cloud-like objects here and here,

00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:40.590
which were the clouds
that Magellan noticed.

00:10:40.590 --> 00:10:45.800
And they are today called
the "Magellanic Clouds."

00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:50.670
And we know them now as satellite
galaxies of the Milky Way.

00:10:50.670 --> 00:10:54.430
But at the time, their
nature was not understood.

00:10:54.430 --> 00:10:58.990
So again, you can see
the magnificent artwork,

00:10:58.990 --> 00:11:02.590
how beautifully things --
the pictures are rendered.

00:11:02.590 --> 00:11:07.010
But more importantly, the
star positions are accurate.

00:11:07.010 --> 00:11:13.060
Bayer had all the information
from Tycho Brahe.

00:11:13.060 --> 00:11:16.860
What he did not have
yet was a telescope,

00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:21.590
but this was the most
up-to-date information.

00:11:21.590 --> 00:11:28.490
And for most people, suddenly being
able to see new constellations

00:11:28.490 --> 00:11:33.960
in the Southern Hemisphere, this
must have been quite a shock.

00:11:38.070 --> 00:11:42.190
So no talk about star
charts would be complete

00:11:42.190 --> 00:11:47.970
without something from
Solarius from 1660.

00:11:47.970 --> 00:11:52.230
Again, this is the Southern
Hemisphere, lots going on,

00:11:52.230 --> 00:11:59.930
magnificent color, but
not really an improvement

00:11:59.930 --> 00:12:02.970
over what was known
in the earlier ones.

00:12:02.970 --> 00:12:07.350
I don't have the -- there we go.

00:12:07.350 --> 00:12:09.380
So this is Edmund Halley.

00:12:09.380 --> 00:12:14.340
You usually see him as an older
man with a great long white wig.

00:12:14.340 --> 00:12:17.990
But when he was very young,
when he was about 20 years old,

00:12:17.990 --> 00:12:24.420
he hadn't even finished college,
he took it upon himself to travel

00:12:24.420 --> 00:12:28.130
to the island of St.
Helena to map the stars

00:12:28.130 --> 00:12:30.050
of the Southern Hemisphere.

00:12:30.050 --> 00:12:32.960
And he used a telescope.

00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:38.990
In the North, Flamsteed, the first
astronomer royal at Greenwich,

00:12:38.990 --> 00:12:43.010
was making careful
maps with a telescope,

00:12:43.010 --> 00:12:47.900
and Halley had observed a little
bit with him, and wanted to be able

00:12:47.900 --> 00:12:49.620
to bring in the Southern stars.

00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:52.120
And he was very excited.

00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:56.670
He knew there was going to be a
solar eclipse, a lunar eclipse

00:12:56.670 --> 00:12:59.070
and a transitive Mercury.

00:12:59.070 --> 00:13:02.610
What he didn't count
on was St. Helena.

00:13:02.610 --> 00:13:04.490
The weather was terrible.

00:13:04.490 --> 00:13:08.550
He got maybe an hour a night
when he could really observe.

00:13:08.550 --> 00:13:14.340
But he did discover
more than 300 new stars.

00:13:14.340 --> 00:13:18.560
So he published his
findings himself.

00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:20.090
But they really didn't get spread

00:13:20.090 --> 00:13:26.690
around until Hevelius
published his Firmamentum.

00:13:26.690 --> 00:13:31.080
And you can see that on the left.

00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:33.710
And the funny thing about this --

00:13:33.710 --> 00:13:35.890
you notice they look
like mirror images.

00:13:35.890 --> 00:13:40.800
That's the Bayer on the
right, and the Hevelius

00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:43.300 position:56%
on the left, which is more accurate.

00:13:43.300 --> 00:13:48.140
But the reason they look like
mirror images is because they are;

00:13:48.140 --> 00:13:51.840
because Bayer looked up at
the stars from the Earth,

00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:55.400
and Hevelius took a God's eye view,

00:13:55.400 --> 00:14:01.680
as though the stars were
printed on a celestial globe.

00:14:03.050 --> 00:14:06.430
So they mirror each other.

00:14:06.430 --> 00:14:11.030
And this shows Halley's new work.

00:14:11.030 --> 00:14:19.640
But the next big advance
wasn't until the 1750s

00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:27.970 position:56%
when the French astronomer La Caile,
went to South Africa and made a --

00:14:27.970 --> 00:14:32.000
had much better weather,
and made a very careful map

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
of the Southern skies,

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:39.970
and introduced another
14 new constellations.

00:14:45.050 --> 00:14:46.580
And here they are in color.

00:14:46.580 --> 00:14:49.110
So you can see some of the names.

00:14:49.110 --> 00:14:55.880
Because rather than --
there were plenty of maps,

00:14:55.880 --> 00:15:01.470
plenty of ancient heroes in
the skies, plenty of dragons.

00:15:01.470 --> 00:15:04.790
You don't have to say, "Here
be dragons" on star charts,

00:15:04.790 --> 00:15:08.090
because the skies are full of them.

00:15:08.090 --> 00:15:11.140
But you can see he
named Telescopium,

00:15:11.140 --> 00:15:14.070
and Microscopium, and Horologium.

00:15:14.070 --> 00:15:22.130
So this was a new list
of heroes in the sky.

00:15:22.130 --> 00:15:26.290
I'm definitely getting
the hang of it now.

00:15:26.290 --> 00:15:30.660 position:56%
Okay; so here's La Caile on the left

00:15:30.660 --> 00:15:36.890
with his 14 new constellations,
and Bayer on the right.

00:15:36.890 --> 00:15:40.910
So you can see, things are
getting really crowded.

00:15:40.910 --> 00:15:48.730
And it's starting to be difficult
to fit in all those pictures.

00:15:54.360 --> 00:15:59.060
This is Johannes Bode's
Uranographia.

00:15:59.060 --> 00:16:01.520
This came out in 1801.

00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:09.960
So it's a 200-year time span
from the Bayer, 1603, to this.

00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:15.120
And the -- it's a colossal book.

00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:18.880
And the renderings are magnificent.

00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:25.780
And again, it's the latest
word in accuracy of position.

00:16:25.780 --> 00:16:29.750
And it's really the last
atlas that took that kind

00:16:29.750 --> 00:16:32.950
of trouble with the illustrations.

00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:43.240
And by the next one, which is
Argulander [phonetic] in 1843,

00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:47.210
you can see the pictures now,
they're just a little sketch.

00:16:47.210 --> 00:16:51.210
The stars are the more
important thing.

00:16:51.210 --> 00:16:55.820
And there start to
be these outlines,

00:16:55.820 --> 00:17:00.300
which is the way the constellations
are depicted on modern star charts,

00:17:00.300 --> 00:17:04.480
just the outlines of
the stellar territory

00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:10.030
that each constellation takes up.

00:17:10.030 --> 00:17:15.890 position:56%
And an American astronomer, Benjamin
Apthorp Gould, was the person

00:17:15.890 --> 00:17:22.250
who decided to make a very
thorough map of the stars

00:17:22.250 --> 00:17:28.400
of the Southern Hemisphere with
all the most modern approaches.

00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:33.500
And he was a difficult personality.

00:17:33.500 --> 00:17:37.260
He'd been fired from one job,
and didn't get another one.

00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:42.450
But his work on the Southern
stars was truly excellent.

00:17:42.450 --> 00:17:46.250
And it didn't look like
the earlier catalogues.

00:17:46.250 --> 00:17:52.080
You get charts like this, which
are giving exact positions,

00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:59.780
apparent magnitudes of the
stars, and kind of a diagram

00:17:59.780 --> 00:18:02.080
from the perspective
of the South Pole.

00:18:06.550 --> 00:18:11.840
So Argulander's book was 1877.

00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:19.310
In the 1880s, photography
really started to reach a point

00:18:19.310 --> 00:18:22.220
where could be useful
to astronomers.

00:18:22.220 --> 00:18:27.700
At first, the wet plates, people
tried, there were a few photographs

00:18:27.700 --> 00:18:30.570
of stars made, but it
was very difficult,

00:18:30.570 --> 00:18:33.470
and you couldn't do long exposures.

00:18:33.470 --> 00:18:37.710
I'm cheating a little because
this is a photograph from 1952.

00:18:37.710 --> 00:18:42.420
But you get the sense of
how much more shows up.

00:18:42.420 --> 00:18:47.110
Because once you can do a
long exposure photograph,

00:18:47.110 --> 00:18:53.050 position:56%
the light can just accumulate on the
plate, and stars that are too faint

00:18:53.050 --> 00:18:56.610
to show up even through the
most powerful instrument

00:18:56.610 --> 00:18:59.940
and the most skilled
observer looking through it,

00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:03.570
will register on the
photographic film.

00:19:03.570 --> 00:19:10.740
And this possibility was what
inspired Edward Pickering

00:19:10.740 --> 00:19:16.770 position:56%
at the Harvard College
Observatory to really commit himself

00:19:16.770 --> 00:19:19.900 position:56%
to a program of all sky photography.

00:19:19.900 --> 00:19:24.120
He likes to say he was
inspired by his younger brother,

00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:28.340 position:56%
who was teaching photography at MIT.

00:19:28.340 --> 00:19:32.780
But there had also been
an astronomical event,

00:19:32.780 --> 00:19:37.630
the Comet of 1882,
which was observed

00:19:37.630 --> 00:19:40.290
from South Africa by David Gill.

00:19:40.290 --> 00:19:45.260
And Gill was desperate to
take pictures of this comet.

00:19:45.260 --> 00:19:49.770
And he borrowed a newspaper
person's camera,

00:19:49.770 --> 00:19:53.460
and literally just strapped
it on the telescope.

00:19:53.460 --> 00:19:57.310
And not only did he get
good pictures of the comet,

00:19:57.310 --> 00:20:02.390
but people were dumbstruck by the
quality of the background sky.

00:20:02.390 --> 00:20:07.030
So this really looked
like a way to improve

00:20:07.030 --> 00:20:12.740
on the painstaking measurements
being made all through the night

00:20:12.740 --> 00:20:15.150
by practicing astronomers.

00:20:15.150 --> 00:20:20.950
And because Pickering
wanted the entire sky,

00:20:20.950 --> 00:20:25.950
he built a satellite
observatory at Arequipa in Peru.

00:20:25.950 --> 00:20:31.960
And he had a phenomenal
knack for attracting money.

00:20:33.180 --> 00:20:39.990 position:56%
And much of his project was paid for
by two heiresses who were interested

00:20:39.990 --> 00:20:45.400
in astronomy, Anna Palmer Draper
and Catherine Wolfe Bruce.

00:20:45.400 --> 00:20:51.190
And Miss Bruce put down --
wrote him a check for $50,000

00:20:51.190 --> 00:20:55.970
to buy the big telescope he wanted
for the observatory in Peru.

00:20:59.330 --> 00:21:01.940
So Pickering sent one
of this favorite people,

00:21:01.940 --> 00:21:06.840
Solan Bailey [phonetic], to run
the observatory at Arequipa.

00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:09.960
And Bailey got fascinated
by these objects.

00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:12.300
Again, this is a modern photograph.

00:21:12.300 --> 00:21:15.060
But this is a globular cluster.

00:21:15.060 --> 00:21:20.300
Astronomers are very pedestrian
the way they name things, you know,

00:21:20.300 --> 00:21:23.230
"Big Bang," "globular cluster."

00:21:23.230 --> 00:21:27.290
It looks like what it sounds like.

00:21:27.290 --> 00:21:33.620
And this is a giant
beehive of stars.

00:21:33.620 --> 00:21:37.130
And one of the things Bailey
tried to do, he and his wife,

00:21:37.130 --> 00:21:41.680
he would take these pictures, and
then they would put a grid over it,

00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:45.300
almost like a latitude and
longitude grid, and they would try

00:21:45.300 --> 00:21:49.890
to count all the stars in
each of these pictures,

00:21:49.890 --> 00:21:55.340
and also assess their brightness
relative to one another.

00:21:55.340 --> 00:22:02.030
The other thing they
photographed were spectra.

00:22:02.030 --> 00:22:06.890
So this is an image
taken with a prism

00:22:06.890 --> 00:22:09.670
at the far end of the telescope.

00:22:09.670 --> 00:22:14.140
And so instead of seeing
little dots of starlight,

00:22:14.140 --> 00:22:18.330
you're actually seeing
the spectra of the stars.

00:22:18.330 --> 00:22:20.700
And the black splotch
there is a penny.

00:22:20.700 --> 00:22:23.940
It's just to give you
a sense of the size.

00:22:28.640 --> 00:22:32.140
And Pickering was very
forward-thinking.

00:22:32.140 --> 00:22:38.940
He hired mostly women to
analyze these photographs.

00:22:38.940 --> 00:22:42.380
So he has telescopes
now, both hemispheres,

00:22:42.380 --> 00:22:46.340
working all through the
night every clear night.

00:22:46.340 --> 00:22:52.940
And the glass plates were
accumulating by the thousands.

00:22:52.940 --> 00:22:56.140
And no matter how many
people he hired,

00:22:56.140 --> 00:22:59.730
they never really got all
the information they could

00:22:59.730 --> 00:23:01.050
from the plates.

00:23:01.050 --> 00:23:07.930
But it was a whole new effort
at mapping, and also at looking

00:23:07.930 --> 00:23:13.020
at the spectra to see what could
be learned about the stars.

00:23:13.020 --> 00:23:15.560
You know, up to this
point, astronomy,

00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:19.620
feller [phonetic] astronomy was
all about position and navigation.

00:23:19.620 --> 00:23:23.660
Now, something -- because
of spectroscopy,

00:23:23.660 --> 00:23:26.750 position:56%
something physical could be learned.

00:23:26.750 --> 00:23:31.000
And Mrs. Draper's husband, Henry,
who was pioneer in the field said

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:35.460
that spectroscopy had made
the chemist's arms millions

00:23:35.460 --> 00:23:37.080
of miles long.

00:23:37.080 --> 00:23:42.860
So these are two of the most
accomplished, most famous ladies

00:23:42.860 --> 00:23:50.050
in the group that would sometimes
referred to as "Pickering's Harem."

00:23:50.050 --> 00:23:53.740
So in the white dress
is Annie Jump Cannon.

00:23:53.740 --> 00:23:57.320
And when she came to
the observatory in 1996,

00:23:57.320 --> 00:24:02.160
she was assigned the bright
stars of the Southern Hemisphere,

00:24:02.160 --> 00:24:05.060
and to look at them individually,

00:24:05.060 --> 00:24:10.990
and to try to perfect a
classification scheme.

00:24:10.990 --> 00:24:14.920
Stars -- the spectra came
in different varieties,

00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:18.060
and what did that mean, and
how could they be grouped?

00:24:18.060 --> 00:24:23.100
And the women standing next to
her is Henrietta Swan Leavitt,

00:24:23.100 --> 00:24:27.380
and she looked at the
photographs of the stars

00:24:27.380 --> 00:24:33.230
and studied the way the variable
stars changed their light.

00:24:33.230 --> 00:24:36.170
So here are some large spectra.

00:24:36.170 --> 00:24:41.770
When Miss Cannon was looking at
the spectra of the bright stars,

00:24:41.770 --> 00:24:44.540
they were greatly enlarged.

00:24:44.540 --> 00:24:47.840
And she came up with a system.

00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:51.030
She was the third woman
at the observatory

00:24:51.030 --> 00:24:53.060
to work on creating a system.

00:24:53.060 --> 00:24:55.700
But her system is still
in use today.

00:24:55.700 --> 00:25:00.600
So if you take an astronomy class,
you learn that the major types

00:25:00.600 --> 00:25:10.010 position:56%
of starts are O B A F G K M. And the
mnemonic for remembering that is,

00:25:10.010 --> 00:25:13.030
"Oh, be a fine girl, kiss me."

00:25:13.030 --> 00:25:19.050
[Laughter] And nowadays people
say, "Oh, be a fine guy, kiss me."

00:25:19.050 --> 00:25:23.420
But it all comes down to Miss
Cannon's plan, which had started

00:25:23.420 --> 00:25:26.190
out being in alphabetical order.

00:25:26.190 --> 00:25:29.880
But as more was learned about
the spectra and the stars,

00:25:29.880 --> 00:25:34.110
she saw a reason to fiddle
with the alphabetical order.

00:25:34.110 --> 00:25:41.030
And one of the things that came
out of the classification was --

00:25:41.030 --> 00:25:44.640
this is a famous diagram
in astronomy.

00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:53.170
And it plots the temperatures of
the stars against their sizes.

00:25:53.170 --> 00:25:58.930
And the classification turned
out to have everything to do

00:25:58.930 --> 00:26:02.710
with the temperatures of the stars,
which no one knew at the beginning.

00:26:02.710 --> 00:26:05.710
They weren't really sure
what was causing the spectra

00:26:05.710 --> 00:26:09.810
to look different from
one category to the next.

00:26:09.810 --> 00:26:12.620 position:56%
And it turned out to be temperature.

00:26:12.620 --> 00:26:17.770
So here's Miss Leavitt working
at her desk at the observatory,

00:26:17.770 --> 00:26:23.600 position:56%
looking at these images, following
the way the stars changed brightness

00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:24.900
over time.

00:26:24.900 --> 00:26:29.340
So she's got some photographs
that are taken hours apart,

00:26:29.340 --> 00:26:32.460
days apart, months apart.

00:26:32.460 --> 00:26:38.740
And she -- because she was
interested in variable stars,

00:26:38.740 --> 00:26:45.610
she found a great number of them
-- let's see if that's my next one,

00:26:45.610 --> 00:26:52.520
in those Magellanic clouds that
showed up in the early maps.

00:26:52.520 --> 00:26:54.820
Here they are.

00:26:58.360 --> 00:27:02.020
This is -- oh I'm sorry about that.

00:27:02.020 --> 00:27:04.830
The modern star maps aren't
all that exciting to look at.

00:27:04.830 --> 00:27:09.040
But you can see where
those clouds are.

00:27:09.040 --> 00:27:12.140
Here is an actual -- this is
one of the Harvard plates.

00:27:12.140 --> 00:27:14.760
So this is the small
Magellanic cloud.

00:27:14.760 --> 00:27:18.590
And she was looking at this one.

00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:22.760
Oh, there's one of those
globular clusters again.

00:27:22.760 --> 00:27:28.020
And this is the large
Magellanic cloud.

00:27:28.020 --> 00:27:30.920
These are other notations.

00:27:30.920 --> 00:27:34.650
People studied the plates
for all sorts of reasons,

00:27:34.650 --> 00:27:38.900
and they often wrote
right on the glass surface

00:27:38.900 --> 00:27:41.170
in different colors of ink.

00:27:41.170 --> 00:27:43.930
These plates are now
being digitized.

00:27:43.930 --> 00:27:49.580 position:56%
So the markings have to be taken off
before the plates can be digitized.

00:27:49.580 --> 00:27:54.880
And so this plate no longer
exists; it's been swiped clean.

00:27:54.880 --> 00:28:00.950
So as she was looking at the
variable stars in those two clouds,

00:28:00.950 --> 00:28:05.980
she noticed something
truly extraordinary.

00:28:05.980 --> 00:28:08.870
She did -- all the stars in each

00:28:08.870 --> 00:28:13.510
of the clouds were the
same distance away.

00:28:13.510 --> 00:28:25.200
And yet the -- so whatever
stars looked brighter actually

00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:26.500
were brighter.

00:28:26.500 --> 00:28:31.240
They didn't look brighter in the
cloud because they were closer.

00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:33.350
All these stars were
the same distance.

00:28:33.350 --> 00:28:36.690
So she could trust that the
brighter ones really were brighter.

00:28:36.690 --> 00:28:41.240
And she was looking
at variable stars.

00:28:41.240 --> 00:28:44.470
So she made the astounding
observation

00:28:44.470 --> 00:28:49.530
that the brighter stars
took a longer time to cycle

00:28:49.530 --> 00:28:51.710
through their pattern of variation,

00:28:51.710 --> 00:29:01.180
and that you could actually tie
a time period to a brightness.

00:29:01.180 --> 00:29:09.380
And she followed this carefully for
about 25 stars, and it held true,

00:29:09.380 --> 00:29:10.950
and she was able to graph it.

00:29:10.950 --> 00:29:14.560
And her work was published.

00:29:14.560 --> 00:29:20.250
And with that information,
other astronomers were able

00:29:20.250 --> 00:29:23.810
to calibrate a distance scale.

00:29:23.810 --> 00:29:30.560 position:56%
Because if you could find that kind
of star now anywhere in the heavens,

00:29:30.560 --> 00:29:34.970
you knew from its time period
how bright it really was.

00:29:34.970 --> 00:29:38.960
And if it looked dimmer than
it was supposed to look,

00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:42.880
it was farther way, and you
could actually calculate how much

00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:46.030
farther away.

00:29:46.030 --> 00:29:51.360
This is Harlow Shapley, who took
over from Pickering at Harvard.

00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:55.890
This was Pickering's
fantastic round desk.

00:29:55.890 --> 00:30:00.850
It managed to get about 25
feet of tabletop in a circle.

00:30:00.850 --> 00:30:02.260
And he could just spin it around,

00:30:02.260 --> 00:30:04.730
have different projects
at different stations.

00:30:04.730 --> 00:30:06.360
It's really a great invention.

00:30:06.360 --> 00:30:10.140
And then the bookcase in
the middle also revolves.

00:30:10.140 --> 00:30:16.060
And Shapley had been inspired to
look at the globular clusters.

00:30:16.060 --> 00:30:18.540
Even before he came to
Harvard, he worked at one

00:30:18.540 --> 00:30:22.160
of the new big telescopes on
Mount Wilson in California.

00:30:22.160 --> 00:30:26.950
And he looked at all
the globular clusters

00:30:26.950 --> 00:30:29.610
that were all around the Milky Way.

00:30:29.610 --> 00:30:32.590
And he realized that they were --

00:30:32.590 --> 00:30:36.670
they formed a ring
around the Milky Way.

00:30:36.670 --> 00:30:43.780
And where the sun is, where
the yellow, that's the sun.

00:30:43.780 --> 00:30:45.690
And it quickly became clear to him

00:30:45.690 --> 00:30:49.670
that the sun was nowhere near
the center of the galaxy.

00:30:49.670 --> 00:30:54.730
The center was where the red X is.

00:30:54.730 --> 00:30:59.180 position:56%
And he had great fun publishing this

00:30:59.180 --> 00:31:04.850
to take humankind down
a few notches.

00:31:04.850 --> 00:31:09.010
The way he put it was, "Man
is not such a big chicken.

00:31:09.010 --> 00:31:15.230
You know, we're really not
at the center of things."

00:31:15.230 --> 00:31:18.410
Miss Cannon actually
got to go to Peru

00:31:18.410 --> 00:31:23.550
and make her own observations
of the Southern stars.

00:31:23.550 --> 00:31:27.450
And she was really thrilled about
that, because as a young woman

00:31:27.450 --> 00:31:30.990
when she first came to the
Observatory, she had studied them

00:31:30.990 --> 00:31:32.830
without ever having seen them.

00:31:32.830 --> 00:31:36.940
So it was a great thrill
for her to be down there.

00:31:36.940 --> 00:31:40.880
She was close to 60 when she went,
and she had tremendous stamina.

00:31:40.880 --> 00:31:44.880
She walked and rode horseback
all day, and then stayed up

00:31:44.880 --> 00:31:50.900 position:56%
and did her astronomy and said she
had to force herself to go to sleep.

00:31:50.900 --> 00:31:56.880
So this is Edwin Hubble
riding a telescope.

00:31:56.880 --> 00:32:01.960
And Hubble didn't agree
with Shapley.

00:32:01.960 --> 00:32:05.400
Shapley thought that
the Milky Way Galaxy was

00:32:05.400 --> 00:32:10.800
so enormous the way its size had
increased with an understanding

00:32:10.800 --> 00:32:12.730
of a distance scale,

00:32:12.730 --> 00:32:16.670
that it probably constituted
the entire universe.

00:32:16.670 --> 00:32:21.700
And that the other blurry
spirally-looking things

00:32:21.700 --> 00:32:26.690
that could be seen in the sky
were not really other galaxies

00:32:26.690 --> 00:32:29.990
like the Milky Way, they
were just little nebulae.

00:32:29.990 --> 00:32:34.720
And there was a great debate
on this topic that lasted years

00:32:34.720 --> 00:32:40.320
in the astronomy community, "Was
the Milky Way Galaxy the extent

00:32:40.320 --> 00:32:46.330
of the universe, or was it just
one of billions of galaxies?"

00:32:46.330 --> 00:32:52.340
Edwin Hubble was looking
at the Andromeda Nebula,

00:32:52.340 --> 00:32:57.590 position:56%
which is a neighbor of the Milky
Way, and he was able to identify one

00:32:57.590 --> 00:33:00.560
of Miss Levitz's [phonetic]
variable stars.

00:33:00.560 --> 00:33:07.780
And from the distance to
this nebula, he could prove

00:33:07.780 --> 00:33:13.650
that it was not inside the
Milky Way, and that indeed,

00:33:13.650 --> 00:33:17.850
it was its own comparable galaxy.

00:33:17.850 --> 00:33:21.580
And that really changed
the way people have looked

00:33:21.580 --> 00:33:24.200
at the heavens ever since.

00:33:24.200 --> 00:33:30.730
And later, Hubble was also the
person who looked at these objects

00:33:30.730 --> 00:33:35.150
and noticed that the
farther away they were,

00:33:35.150 --> 00:33:37.530
the faster they were moving.

00:33:37.530 --> 00:33:42.400
They could tell the movement of
the galaxies by their spectra.

00:33:42.400 --> 00:33:46.610
If the light was shifted
very far toward the red,

00:33:46.610 --> 00:33:48.410
they were moving away.

00:33:48.410 --> 00:33:52.290 position:56%
And that was how an understanding --

00:33:52.290 --> 00:33:55.360
how astronomers came
to an understanding

00:33:55.360 --> 00:33:58.080
of the expansion of the universe.

00:33:58.080 --> 00:34:07.960
So the Southern Hemisphere today
is still the best place to go.

00:34:07.960 --> 00:34:12.820
This is the European
Southern Observatory.

00:34:12.820 --> 00:34:21.890
They have their telescopes in
the Atacama Desert in Chile.

00:34:21.890 --> 00:34:29.920
And one of the Times reporters
recently described it as saying,

00:34:29.920 --> 00:34:34.230
"You almost feel that the stars
are tangled in your hair."

00:34:34.230 --> 00:34:42.260
On Earth, of course, we have
space telescopes now because even

00:34:42.260 --> 00:34:47.230
from the high desert in Chile,
there is air to contend with,

00:34:47.230 --> 00:34:53.310
and air is always jiggling the
view through the telescope.

00:34:53.310 --> 00:34:59.330
But now that astronomers have
this new technique called

00:34:59.330 --> 00:35:03.340
"adaptive optics," they
can use laser light.

00:35:03.340 --> 00:35:07.000
They actually almost
paint the star on the sky,

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:15.990 position:56%
and then they can be adjusting the
mirror of the telescope by fractions

00:35:15.990 --> 00:35:25.240 position:56%
of a millimeter in milliseconds,
and can get views, earthbound views,

00:35:25.240 --> 00:35:28.970
that are really comparable
to views from space.

00:35:32.040 --> 00:35:34.440
So I'm happy to tell you that some

00:35:34.440 --> 00:35:38.330
of the art is coming
back into the science.

00:35:38.330 --> 00:35:40.860
This is actually a painting.

00:35:40.860 --> 00:35:45.920
Remember this, it's the
small Magellanic cloud.

00:35:45.920 --> 00:35:52.120
So this artist, Lia
Halloran, in Los Angeles,

00:35:52.120 --> 00:35:55.680
shares my fascination
with the Harvard women.

00:35:55.680 --> 00:36:00.430
And she is doing an art
installation that will open

00:36:00.430 --> 00:36:06.630
in Delaware next spring using
the plates they examined,

00:36:06.630 --> 00:36:10.580
but turning them into artworks.

00:36:10.580 --> 00:36:18.940
So she paints the stars first,
and then she covers the sheets

00:36:18.940 --> 00:36:27.490
with a photosensitive material,
and puts them out in the sun,

00:36:27.490 --> 00:36:29.680
and creates -- and
these are gigantic,

00:36:29.680 --> 00:36:31.980
they're about six feet square.

00:36:36.040 --> 00:36:39.080
This is a very scientific map.

00:36:39.080 --> 00:36:43.180
This is the work of
astronomer Andrea Ghez.

00:36:43.180 --> 00:36:47.740
And the astronomers are busy
putting the monsters back

00:36:47.740 --> 00:36:50.340
in maps of the stars.

00:36:50.340 --> 00:36:56.350
What she and her team have
discovered these are stars near the

00:36:56.350 --> 00:36:58.690
center of the Milky Way.

00:36:58.690 --> 00:37:05.130
And they've been watching
these stars orbit the center

00:37:05.130 --> 00:37:06.940
of the Milky Way.

00:37:06.940 --> 00:37:11.440
And there is a uncanny
speed to these motions,

00:37:11.440 --> 00:37:14.930
far more than anyone theorized.

00:37:14.930 --> 00:37:21.770
And the only explanation is
that there is something massive

00:37:21.770 --> 00:37:28.150
at the center of the galaxy;
massive but invisible.

00:37:28.150 --> 00:37:34.090 position:56%
And in their wonderfully descriptive
way, astronomers call it a

00:37:34.090 --> 00:37:39.090
"super-massive black hole."

00:37:39.090 --> 00:37:42.520
[Laughter] And this
object is estimated

00:37:42.520 --> 00:37:47.970
to be four million times
the mass of the sun.

00:37:53.170 --> 00:37:57.070
And it was there all the time.

00:37:57.070 --> 00:38:00.930
[Laughter] I think I'll
end with that picture.

00:38:00.930 --> 00:38:04.510
If we have time for questions --

00:38:04.510 --> 00:38:15.230
[ Applause ]

00:38:15.230 --> 00:38:18.400 position:56%
&gt;&gt; John Hessler: And you do you have
some time for questions if we --

00:38:18.400 --> 00:38:19.700
&gt;&gt; Dava Sobel: Yes.

00:38:19.700 --> 00:38:22.370
I cannot see the audience, though.

00:38:22.370 --> 00:38:25.420
&gt;&gt; How many different positions

00:38:25.420 --> 00:38:28.760
across the Southern
Hemisphere did you need to get

00:38:28.760 --> 00:38:30.060
to see the entire [inaudible]?

00:38:30.060 --> 00:38:32.120
&gt;&gt; Dava Sobel: How many
different positions did they need

00:38:32.120 --> 00:38:34.120
across the Southern Hemisphere?

00:38:34.120 --> 00:38:36.090
They really could do with one,

00:38:36.090 --> 00:38:38.450
because the Earth cooperatively
turns.

00:38:38.450 --> 00:38:41.380
So you just have to get
the Southern latitude,

00:38:41.380 --> 00:38:42.990
and then you get the whole sky.

00:38:42.990 --> 00:38:49.550
So they started in Peru, and
then they lost the weather.

00:38:49.550 --> 00:38:53.990
They were there for --
until about the 1920s,

00:38:53.990 --> 00:38:56.650 position:56%
and then they moved to South Africa.

00:38:56.650 --> 00:39:02.050 position:56%
The weather, which was notorious at
first -- people would get down there

00:39:02.050 --> 00:39:07.570
and were just astounded
at what they could see.

00:39:07.570 --> 00:39:12.090
And they would almost hope for bad
weather so they would have time

00:39:12.090 --> 00:39:14.890
to make repairs, or take a rest.

00:39:14.890 --> 00:39:18.480
But it was just great
night after night.

00:39:18.480 --> 00:39:23.750
So the total plate -- this
went on for a hundred years.

00:39:23.750 --> 00:39:27.010
So there are a half
a million plates,

00:39:27.010 --> 00:39:29.280
and they're all still at Harvard.

00:39:29.280 --> 00:39:32.250
And they are -- as I said,
they're being digitized

00:39:32.250 --> 00:39:39.300
because the information
content has not been scratched.

00:39:41.790 --> 00:39:46.710
And the star position plates
are still very valuable.

00:39:46.710 --> 00:39:49.330
And it's a unique collection.

00:39:49.330 --> 00:39:54.060
&gt;&gt; I'd like to know a
little more about the women,

00:39:54.060 --> 00:39:58.110
what kind of education, were
they well-paid, respected?

00:39:58.110 --> 00:40:02.520
&gt;&gt; Dava Sobel: The women
at the very beginning,

00:40:02.520 --> 00:40:05.830
they mostly had a high
school education.

00:40:05.830 --> 00:40:08.810
At the very beginning, of course,
they were the family members

00:40:08.810 --> 00:40:12.570
of the astronomers,
wives, sisters, daughters.

00:40:12.570 --> 00:40:15.170
But they did a really good job.

00:40:15.170 --> 00:40:19.010
And that opened the way
for other women to come in.

00:40:19.010 --> 00:40:22.980
But also at that time right around
the time photography was coming in,

00:40:22.980 --> 00:40:25.410
the women's colleges were started.

00:40:25.410 --> 00:40:31.860
So schools like Vassar and
Smith became feeder schools

00:40:31.860 --> 00:40:38.270
to the Wellesley, to the Harvard
Observatory, and Radcliff too.

00:40:38.270 --> 00:40:41.750
And so the women were
college-educated.

00:40:41.750 --> 00:40:43.740
Well paid, no.

00:40:43.740 --> 00:40:45.950
Was it -- no it was never thus.

00:40:45.950 --> 00:40:48.460
They were never well-paid.

00:40:48.460 --> 00:40:52.000
But their work was valued.

00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:55.480
They were -- everything they did
was published; they got their names

00:40:55.480 --> 00:41:00.950
on everything; they were members
of astronomical organizations.

00:41:00.950 --> 00:41:03.970
It was a happy story.

00:41:14.100 --> 00:41:18.920 position:56%
&gt;&gt; If you want to trace the history
back to the 16th century, you had --

00:41:18.920 --> 00:41:24.560
let's say -- you had
observations with the naked eye.

00:41:24.560 --> 00:41:25.860
&gt;&gt; Dava Sobel: Yes.

00:41:25.860 --> 00:41:30.840
&gt;&gt; You then had telescopes, which
showed obviously a lot more stars.

00:41:30.840 --> 00:41:32.900
And then you finally
had photography,

00:41:32.900 --> 00:41:35.900
which would show basically
an infinite number.

00:41:35.900 --> 00:41:42.600
My question is when they moved from
the naked eye to the telescopes

00:41:42.600 --> 00:41:46.860
on those charts that you've
observed, did the number

00:41:46.860 --> 00:41:50.430
of stars increase dramatically?

00:41:50.430 --> 00:41:54.620
Do they continue -- do they start
showing the very finest ones?

00:41:54.620 --> 00:41:55.920
&gt;&gt; Dava Sobel: Oh, yes.

00:41:55.920 --> 00:41:57.220
Oh, the number increased.

00:41:57.220 --> 00:42:03.520
And so each project
had its own system.

00:42:03.520 --> 00:42:06.720
First you would try to ascertain
whether the star you were looking

00:42:06.720 --> 00:42:11.110
at appeared in some catalogue,
or if it was really a new one.

00:42:11.110 --> 00:42:13.650
And if you couldn't find it
in any of the catalogues,

00:42:13.650 --> 00:42:16.180 position:56%
then you would give it a new number.

00:42:16.180 --> 00:42:19.030
And you would list
it in your catalogue.

00:42:19.030 --> 00:42:22.050
&gt;&gt; But the more powerful
the telescope,

00:42:22.050 --> 00:42:23.600
the more you could see, obviously.

00:42:23.600 --> 00:42:25.360
&gt;&gt; Dava Sobel: Yes; and
the longer the exposure,

00:42:25.360 --> 00:42:26.660
the more you could see.

00:42:26.660 --> 00:42:27.960
&gt;&gt; Sure, sure.

00:42:27.960 --> 00:42:32.450
One other quick question, the most
famous Southern constellation,

00:42:32.450 --> 00:42:35.490
let's say to navigators,
is the Southern Cross.

00:42:35.490 --> 00:42:39.460
I don't think I saw the Southern
Cross on any of your diagrams;

00:42:39.460 --> 00:42:41.600
or maybe I just missed it.

00:42:41.600 --> 00:42:45.610
&gt;&gt; Dava Sobel: I'm not sure how
well it shows up on any of these.

00:42:45.610 --> 00:42:48.060
&gt;&gt; Can you talk a little bit
about how the illustrations

00:42:48.060 --> 00:42:53.110
of the constellations
were developed?

00:42:53.110 --> 00:43:02.130
You said that they were [inaudible]
the ideas and the illustrations?

00:43:02.130 --> 00:43:05.640 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Dave Sobel: Well, all of that was
inherited from the ancient myths.

00:43:05.640 --> 00:43:11.960
So those constellations
had names from antiquity;

00:43:11.960 --> 00:43:18.340
and names like Orion, or
Hydra, the water snake, Gemini,

00:43:18.340 --> 00:43:20.960
all the zodiac constellations.

00:43:20.960 --> 00:43:25.040
They were handed down
from ancient times.

00:43:25.040 --> 00:43:28.280
And it was up to the person
creating the calendar,

00:43:28.280 --> 00:43:32.340
doing the artwork, to render them.

00:43:32.340 --> 00:43:35.760
And they didn't always
render them the same ways.

00:43:35.760 --> 00:43:42.230
So you might be looking up at
the sky or down from the sky.

00:43:42.230 --> 00:43:45.000
They might be more or less ornate.

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:50.350
The figure might be shown
from the front, or the back.

00:43:50.350 --> 00:43:53.190
People had a lot of
freedom with the pictures.

00:43:53.190 --> 00:43:55.460
The important -- and
in the beginning,

00:43:55.460 --> 00:43:56.790
the pictures were more important,

00:43:56.790 --> 00:43:59.550
and the stars were
dotted in at random.

00:43:59.550 --> 00:44:02.950
Then the positions of the
stars became more important,

00:44:02.950 --> 00:44:06.050 position:56%
and the pictures had to uphold that.

00:44:06.050 --> 00:44:10.200
And then the pictures just
faded from importance.

00:44:10.200 --> 00:44:13.860 position:56%
But they were imaginative renderings

00:44:13.860 --> 00:44:19.560
from ancient well-known
stories, Perseus, Andromeda.

00:44:19.560 --> 00:44:23.120
&gt;&gt; Even for the new constellations

00:44:23.120 --> 00:44:25.480
that were being discovered
[inaudible]?

00:44:25.480 --> 00:44:27.110
&gt;&gt; Dava Sobel: No; for
the new constellations,

00:44:27.110 --> 00:44:28.410
they would make up new things.

00:44:28.410 --> 00:44:31.220
For instance, Halley made
up a new constellation

00:44:31.220 --> 00:44:35.460
for Charles, with an oak.

00:44:35.460 --> 00:44:39.350
And then, La Caile would
name constellations

00:44:39.350 --> 00:44:41.550
for scientific instruments.

00:44:41.550 --> 00:44:50.400
The constellations that the Dutch
traders devised were mostly birds.

00:44:50.400 --> 00:44:54.330
Maybe they were birds they had
seen in the Southern Hemisphere.

00:44:54.330 --> 00:44:57.950
But if you are the
first one who sees it,

00:44:57.950 --> 00:45:01.030
you get to say what you
think it looks like.

00:45:01.030 --> 00:45:05.580
And then that's how it remains.

00:45:09.130 --> 00:45:12.370
&gt;&gt; Did the invention
of the chronometer

00:45:12.370 --> 00:45:17.150
by John Harrison influence
mapping of stars?

00:45:17.150 --> 00:45:21.010 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Dava Sobel: Well, the chronometer
helped people find their position

00:45:21.010 --> 00:45:22.310
at sea.

00:45:22.310 --> 00:45:28.420
And if you remember the story,
the chronometer was in competition

00:45:28.420 --> 00:45:32.960
with the learner distance
method, which relied totally

00:45:32.960 --> 00:45:35.660
on accurate maps of the heavens,

00:45:35.660 --> 00:45:40.990
and was the reason observatories
were built, to map the heavens

00:45:40.990 --> 00:45:43.520
for purposes of navigation.

00:45:43.520 --> 00:45:50.290
So when the astronomers
came -- began mapping --

00:45:50.290 --> 00:45:52.120
continued mapping stars

00:45:52.120 --> 00:45:55.980
with precision time
instruments, they needed that.

00:45:55.980 --> 00:46:00.670
They needed to be able to
time their observations.

00:46:00.670 --> 00:46:04.150
They didn't have to have
something quite so portable.

00:46:04.150 --> 00:46:09.920
But an observatory always had an
extremely accurate clock that was

00:46:09.920 --> 00:46:12.850
as important as the telescope.

00:46:12.850 --> 00:46:15.800
&gt;&gt; We can go with one more.

00:46:17.870 --> 00:46:21.220
&gt;&gt; I have the power.

00:46:23.330 --> 00:46:26.160
[Laughter] Is a constellation
defined by a set of criteria,

00:46:26.160 --> 00:46:27.830
or is it just a human thing?

00:46:27.830 --> 00:46:31.260
&gt;&gt; Dava Sobel: I'm
sorry, is it defined by --

00:46:31.260 --> 00:46:33.920
&gt;&gt; An objective set of criteria?

00:46:33.920 --> 00:46:37.930
&gt;&gt; Dava Sobel: An objective set
of criteria; absolutely not.

00:46:37.930 --> 00:46:41.690
No; and different cultures
have different constellations.

00:46:41.690 --> 00:46:45.430
It's really -- it's like
an ink blot in the sky.

00:46:45.430 --> 00:46:47.730
And then certain things stuck.

00:46:47.730 --> 00:46:50.430
The one that really looks
like what it is to me --

00:46:50.430 --> 00:46:54.760
I don't know if anybody else
agrees, but Orion, the hunter,

00:46:54.760 --> 00:47:00.140
when you look up, it really looks
like a figure of a guy with a club.

00:47:00.140 --> 00:47:01.670
It just really looks like it.

00:47:01.670 --> 00:47:05.670
Whereas Aries, the ram,
[laughter] it just --

00:47:05.670 --> 00:47:10.960
how they got a ram out of
those -- yes, it's a mystery.

00:47:10.960 --> 00:47:17.210
&gt;&gt; I have a question, with your
soon-to-be published book I'm

00:47:17.210 --> 00:47:23.590
wondering whether you are
engaging at all with students

00:47:23.590 --> 00:47:27.550
and personal interests, because
my niece is studying astronomy

00:47:27.550 --> 00:47:28.850
at Tufts.

00:47:28.850 --> 00:47:31.650
And astronomy, I think,
still is underrepresented

00:47:31.650 --> 00:47:33.750
in terms of girls and women.

00:47:33.750 --> 00:47:37.830
And it's sort of a downward
slide from biology, to chemistry,

00:47:37.830 --> 00:47:39.870
to physics, and the math-related.

00:47:39.870 --> 00:47:45.720
And I'm wondering if you're
intersecting with that community

00:47:45.720 --> 00:47:50.270
with the stem in education,
particularly now

00:47:50.270 --> 00:47:54.610
with the intersection of
astronomy and cartography

00:47:54.610 --> 00:47:57.610
that you're talking about,
and if you could comment

00:47:57.610 --> 00:48:06.160 position:56%
on your perspective of education and
inclusion of women in this arena.

00:48:06.160 --> 00:48:08.750
&gt;&gt; Dava Sobel: Well, I certainly
hope to be talking to students,

00:48:08.750 --> 00:48:14.870
and I -- because the book
is so much about women.

00:48:14.870 --> 00:48:16.780
I had an interesting experience,

00:48:16.780 --> 00:48:19.000
I asked one of the
Harvard astronomers --

00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:21.820
at Harvard women are
underrepresented

00:48:21.820 --> 00:48:23.580
in the astronomy faculty.

00:48:23.580 --> 00:48:26.630
But among the graduate
students, it's almost 50/50.

00:48:26.630 --> 00:48:31.240
So I think you'll be
happy to hear that.

00:48:31.240 --> 00:48:37.090
And I had asked one of the
astronomers there, one of the women

00:48:37.090 --> 00:48:41.250
to be one of my technical
expert readers.

00:48:41.250 --> 00:48:42.570
And she was so excited.

00:48:42.570 --> 00:48:44.660
She said, "I always
thought these women,

00:48:44.660 --> 00:48:47.000
that it was just kind
of a cute, quaint story.

00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:51.930
I didn't realize they
actually did science."

00:48:51.930 --> 00:48:57.640
So even being at Harvard
somehow it wasn't widely known.

00:48:57.640 --> 00:48:59.530
Whereas if you go to Wellesley,

00:48:59.530 --> 00:49:01.330
and you mention the
name Annie Jump Cannon,

00:49:01.330 --> 00:49:03.990
everybody knows what she did.

00:49:03.990 --> 00:49:08.100
So this will be an
interesting journey.

00:49:08.100 --> 00:49:11.060
&gt;&gt; John Hessler: Well, the book
is called "The Glass Universe,"

00:49:11.060 --> 00:49:12.360
be out in December, correct?

00:49:12.360 --> 00:49:13.660
&gt;&gt; Dava Sobel: Yes.

00:49:13.660 --> 00:49:15.040
&gt;&gt; John Hessler: I want
to thank Dava for coming

00:49:15.040 --> 00:49:16.480
and giving such a great talk.

00:49:16.480 --> 00:49:18.280
&gt;&gt; Dava Sobel: Thank you.

00:49:18.280 --> 00:49:21.050
[ Applause ]

00:49:21.050 --> 00:49:22.350
&gt;&gt; John Hessler: Thank
you very much.

00:49:22.350 --> 00:49:24.150
It's great.

00:49:24.150 --> 00:49:29.560
[ Applause ]

00:49:29.560 --> 00:49:31.870
And I want to thank
you all for coming.

00:49:31.870 --> 00:49:34.080
Tomorrow morning, the new librarian

00:49:34.080 --> 00:49:38.600
of Congress will be
introducing the conference.

00:49:38.600 --> 00:49:40.890
We will then have some
representatives

00:49:40.890 --> 00:49:43.780
from the Galileo Museum in
the Library of Congress.

00:49:43.780 --> 00:49:46.660
And we will be launching our
new Walter E. Mueller website

00:49:46.660 --> 00:49:47.960
to the world.

00:49:47.960 --> 00:49:53.040
We will also be having a talk
after that by Elmer Eusman,

00:49:53.040 --> 00:49:56.230
who is the chief conservator here
at the Library, who's going to talk

00:49:56.230 --> 00:50:00.940
about the complicated conservation
issues, and the physical studies

00:50:00.940 --> 00:50:02.860
that were done at the
Walter E. Mueller materials,

00:50:02.860 --> 00:50:04.160
and what they've taught.

00:50:04.160 --> 00:50:05.950
So I hope to see you tomorrow.

00:50:05.950 --> 00:50:08.250
Thanks very much for coming.

00:50:09.680 --> 00:50:13.340
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
