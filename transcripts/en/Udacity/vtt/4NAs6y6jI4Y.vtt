00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:03.110
In our last video, we considered possible models for

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:05.560
implementing our regression estimation problem.

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:09.530
In later lessons, we'll discuss in much greater detail which models are most

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:12.970
appropriate to take advantage of structure that might exist in data.

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:15.380
At this moment, let's choose linear regression.
