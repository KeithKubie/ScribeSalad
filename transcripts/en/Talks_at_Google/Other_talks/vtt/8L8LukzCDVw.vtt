ELEANOR: Hi, my name
is Eleanor [INAUDIBLE],

00:00:01.833 --> 00:00:04.330
and on behalf of the
Jewglers New York group

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:05.940
and the Talks At Google group.

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.180
I am so thrilled to welcome you
to the Google New York Hanukkah

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:10.470
party.

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:12.380
And, whoo!

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:14.580
That's what I like to hear.

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.200
And I have the pleasure today
of welcoming a very, very

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:18.674
special few guests.

00:00:18.674 --> 00:00:20.340
So, we're thrilled
to bring them onstage

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.530
and without further ado, a happy
Hanukkah, to Neshama and Josh

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:24.736
in the encore.

00:00:24.736 --> 00:00:25.630
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:27.744
Woo hoo!

00:00:27.744 --> 00:00:30.244
[MUSIC - NESHAMA CARLEBACH AND
 JOSH NELSON, "HAVA NASHIRA"]

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:43.910
JOSH NELSON: Try that.

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:44.410
You got it.

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:03.990
[APPLAUSE]

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:05.190
JOSH NELSON: Give yourselves
a big round of applause,

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:05.980
you sound so good!

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:06.480
All right!

00:05:08.705 --> 00:05:11.163
[MUSIC - NESHAMA CARLEBACH AND
 JOSH NELSON, "Y'HI SHALOM"]

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:17.580
NESHAMA CARLEBACH: So this is
one of my most favorite prayers

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:18.130
in the world.

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:21.620
It's called "Y'hi Shalom."

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:24.150
May there be peace
in your borders,

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:29.920
and tranquility in your castles,
which is such a deep concept.

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:33.960
Can I have a bit more
of myself, please?

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:38.350
Can you imagine how beautiful
this world would be,

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:41.330
if we didn't only understand
the secret of having peace

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:44.900
within our borders, but
serenity inside of our hearts,

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:46.687
inside of our souls?

00:05:46.687 --> 00:05:49.270
A world where nobody questioned
their decisions, a world where

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:51.770
there was no regret,
because it was clear

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:54.450
that every step of our
journey has taken us exactly

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:56.264
to the place we have to be.

00:05:56.264 --> 00:05:57.680
We would have space
for ourselves,

00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:59.330
space for each other.

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:01.930
To me, it's the answer.

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:05.130
Peace in our borders, and
tranquility in our castles.

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:07.775
And we are living
in a broken world.

00:06:07.775 --> 00:06:11.525
We're also living in a
world where Google exists.

00:06:11.525 --> 00:06:14.000
You guys better clap
for Google, seriously.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.475
[APPLAUSE]

00:06:16.475 --> 00:06:19.530
Where we're spreading our
arms wider, and opening

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:23.320
the doors wider, and
expanding our thinking,

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:27.960
and our consciousnesses,
and learning, and opening.

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:31.960
And changing how the
world sees the world.

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:34.670
So this is our
prayer, and you can

00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:36.163
pray no matter
where you come from,

00:06:36.163 --> 00:06:39.450
it's just sending some good
wishes into the universe,

00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:41.790
and hoping that the higher
power, whatever it is

00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:44.720
that's above us, is listening.

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:46.610
That's what we're here for.

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:48.916
So we hope that you will sing.

00:06:48.916 --> 00:06:51.446
And that at this moment,
somewhere in the world,

00:06:51.446 --> 00:06:53.612
there's going to be a new
glimmer of light and peace

00:06:53.612 --> 00:06:56.560
and hope in somebody's
heart, just because we're

00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:57.774
trying to send it there.

00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:23.052
[APPLAUSE]

00:12:23.052 --> 00:12:24.260
NESHAMA CARLEBACH: Thank you.

00:12:25.884 --> 00:12:28.050
JOSH NELSON: So we got a
little bit of a medley tune

00:12:28.050 --> 00:12:28.890
for you guys.

00:12:28.890 --> 00:12:33.710
We're really lucky that we were
brought to a place of deepness,

00:12:33.710 --> 00:12:37.740
I guess, by really important
mentors in our lives,

00:12:37.740 --> 00:12:40.000
as is usually the case
when you find somebody

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:41.500
who sort of guides
you down the path

00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:43.250
when you don't know
that you're looking.

00:12:43.250 --> 00:12:45.850
And for me that was an
extraordinary musician

00:12:45.850 --> 00:12:49.240
and teacher named Debbie
Friedman, of Blessed Memory.

00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:52.080
And for Neshama, of course, it
was her father, the late Rabbi

00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:53.060
Shlomo Carlebach.

00:12:53.060 --> 00:12:57.210
So together, it's an
incredible blessing

00:12:57.210 --> 00:13:00.100
to have sort of received
those teachings at a young age

00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:02.160
and to have found
ourselves together

00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:04.370
in a musical partnership now.

00:13:04.370 --> 00:13:08.860
So this is a little mash-up of
two of their most best-known.

00:13:08.860 --> 00:13:12.645
[MUSIC - NESHAMA CARLEBACH AND
 JOSH NELSON, HEBREW SONG]

00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:02.620
[APPLAUSE]

00:18:02.620 --> 00:18:05.460
JOSH NELSON: Thank
you all so very much.

00:18:05.460 --> 00:18:07.335
We're going to do one
more little quiet song,

00:18:07.335 --> 00:18:09.501
and then we're going to
light some candles together.

00:18:09.501 --> 00:18:12.210
I know there are kids that are
anxiously awaiting this candle

00:18:12.210 --> 00:18:13.710
lighting, there's
a lot of pressure.

00:18:13.710 --> 00:18:17.017
So we want to share this
little piece of music with you.

00:18:17.017 --> 00:18:19.100
It's in English, but there's
Hebrew in the chorus,

00:18:19.100 --> 00:18:22.850
and the message in the Hebrew
is a really important text

00:18:22.850 --> 00:18:24.860
for our community--
"L'dor vador nagid

00:18:24.860 --> 00:18:28.380
gadlecha," "from
generation to generation

00:18:28.380 --> 00:18:30.620
we will proclaim
your greatness."

00:18:37.480 --> 00:18:43.360
[MUSIC - NESHAMA CARLEBACH AND
 JOSH NELSON, "L'DOR VADOR"]

00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:55.670
JOSH NELSON: Thank you
all so very, very much.

00:22:55.670 --> 00:22:56.120
NESHAMA CARLEBACH: Thank you.

00:22:56.120 --> 00:22:58.203
JOSH NELSON: It was really
an honor and a pleasure

00:22:58.203 --> 00:22:59.332
to be with you today.

00:22:59.332 --> 00:23:01.540
I think we're going to have
an extraordinary lighting

00:23:01.540 --> 00:23:05.130
of candles at this time-- wow.

00:23:05.130 --> 00:23:08.590
This-- there's a first time,
this is a Shehecheyanu,

00:23:08.590 --> 00:23:10.644
from me.

00:23:10.644 --> 00:23:12.185
Is this your first
lava lamp menorah?

00:23:12.185 --> 00:23:12.975
AUDIENCE: Yeah!

00:23:12.975 --> 00:23:18.130
It's also my first
raspberry pie menorah, too.

00:23:18.130 --> 00:23:22.300
It's an exciting day at Google.

00:23:22.300 --> 00:23:25.070
[MUSIC - NESHAMA CARLEBACH AND
 JOSH NELSON, HEBREW SONG]

00:26:42.416 --> 00:26:44.915
JOSH NELSON: Let's just sing
together, come on. [INAUDIBLE],

00:26:44.915 --> 00:26:45.710
here we go.

00:27:45.120 --> 00:27:47.390
[SPEAKING HEBREW],
happy Hanukkah.

00:27:47.390 --> 00:27:48.630
Thanks so much for having us.

00:27:48.630 --> 00:27:49.838
NESHAMA CARLEBACH: Thank you.

00:27:49.838 --> 00:27:51.520
Lots of love, and
blessings, and light.

00:27:51.520 --> 00:27:52.560
Thank you so much.
