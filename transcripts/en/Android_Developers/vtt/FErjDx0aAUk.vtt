SAMI KIZILBASH: So at
Google Play, we love games.

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.040
We want games to be engaging.

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:14.020
We want game developers
to be successful.

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:16.030
VINEET TANWAR: We put
them through a Boot Camp

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:19.500
and they get feedback from
leading industry experts,

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.660
mentors, and they continue to
receive support long after they

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:23.864
graduate from the program.

00:00:23.864 --> 00:00:25.780
ANURAG RANA: The moment
when we were selected,

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:27.680
we're just scrolling through
all the names and saying,

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:28.000
where's our name?

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:28.708
Where's our name?

00:00:28.708 --> 00:00:31.410
And suddenly the name came
up, both of us, we got up,

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.730
we ran to the edge of the
room then came back and gave

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:35.891
each other a huge high-five.

KEERTI SINGH: I think
it's going to be super

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:46.360
awesome, considering all the
people from the gaming industry

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:47.200
would be there.

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.610
There's a lot in store
for all the developers

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:50.980
to learn over here.

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:52.940

SAMI KIZILBASH: Welcome to Indie
Games Accelerator, everybody.

00:01:03.735 --> 00:01:05.980
DESMOND WONG: It's also
been really, really great.

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:08.680
We've learned so much
from all the mentors, even

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.147
our fellow game developers and
Indies from around this region.

00:01:12.147 --> 00:01:13.730
RAMI ISMAIL: One of
my favorite things

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:16.660
was just the variety of problems
and issues and opportunities

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:19.250
that we get to deal
with and help on.

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:22.480
ALOK KEJRIWAL: If you've gained
so much from this industry

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:25.070
and from the people
who helped us,

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:28.144
it's time to give
it back to them.

00:01:28.144 --> 00:01:31.390
HOWARD GO: The best thing in
the program were the mentors.

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:34.600
I think mentors who knew
the business better than us,

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.640
who were able to state
hard truths that allowed

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:39.154
us to change our perspective.

00:01:39.154 --> 00:01:41.320
ASFANDIYAR KHAN: The Indie
Games Accelerator Program

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:43.990
has given me the confidence
that we can really

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:45.655
make amazing games.

00:01:45.655 --> 00:01:47.530
It doesn't matter where
you are in the world.

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:50.890
And my friends and
family are definitely

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:53.870
taking me more seriously and
what I do more seriously.

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:57.040
SAMI KIZILBASH: 2019, I'm
super excited about seeing

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.340
what these Indies come out
with, the new titles, but also

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:02.610
the teams that they
developed over time.

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.300
I'm also excited about bringing
in a whole new batch of Indies,

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:09.180
helping them through the
process of launching new titles

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:12.540
and building their game
studios and seeing what we can

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.240
do with them on a global stage.
