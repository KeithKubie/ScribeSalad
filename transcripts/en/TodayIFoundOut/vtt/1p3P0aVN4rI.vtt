00:00:08.969 --> 00:00:27.800
The 50,000 Word Novel That Doesn’t Contain
the Letter “E”

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:32.079
Ernest Vincent Wright’s 1939 novel Gadsby
is over 50,000 words long.

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:34.400
There is nothing remarkable about that.

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:39.149
What makes this novel noteworthy is that it
doesn’t contain a single letter “e”

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.300
anywhere other than the cover.

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.840
Given that ‘e’ is the most commonly used
letter in English, you might think this would

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:49.339
have been impossible, but Wright stated this
wasn’t nearly as limiting as one might think.

00:00:49.339 --> 00:00:53.080
For instance, about half of the top 500 most
commonly used words in English were still

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:54.680
available to him to use.

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:56.650
That’s not to say it was easy.

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:01.080
Among the more difficult aspects of writing
such a work, Wright had to avoid all “-ed”

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:03.390
endings as well as the word “the”.

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.190
Beyond that, he had to come up with clever,
non-awkward ways to refer to certain things,

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:11.810
such as a ‘Turkey’, which he called a
“Thanksgiving National Bird”, and “wedding

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:15.360
cake”, which was changed to “an astonishing
loaf of culinary art”.

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.550
He wrote the book in just under six months
starting in 1936 and finishing in February

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:21.659
of 1937.

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.650
In order to prevent himself from accidentally
using the letter ‘e’, he disabled the

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.250
key on his typewriter by tying it down.

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:32.330
As to his motivation for writing Gadsby, he
first thought to try writing a book without

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:36.060
the letter ‘e’ after learning that the
letter ‘e’ supposedly occurs in books

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.790
and other writings on average about five times
more often than any other letter in English.

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:44.940
He further became excited about the idea after
discussing the matter with various people

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:49.340
and having everyone tell him that it couldn’t
be done unless one threw out grammar and made

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.070
a habit of creating awkward sentences.

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:55.920
After completing the novel, he wrote:
“As I wrote along, in long-hand at first,

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:01.260
a whole army of little E’s gathered around
my desk, all eagerly expecting to be called

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:02.260
upon.

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:07.270
But gradually as they saw me writing on and
on, without even noticing them, they grew

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:12.420
uneasy; and, with excited whisperings amongst
themselves, began hopping up and riding on

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:17.670
my pen, looking down constantly for a chance
to drop off into some word; for all the world

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.230
like seabirds perched, watching for a passing
fish!

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:26.650
But when they saw that I had covered 138 pages
of typewriter size paper, they slid onto the

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:31.840
floor, walking sadly away, arm in arm; but
shouting back: “You certainly must have

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.430
a hodge-podge of a yarn there without *us*!

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:35.530
Why, man!

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:39.730
We are in every story ever written *hundreds
of thousands of times!

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:43.120
This is the first time we ever were shut out!”

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:47.511
He was unable to find a publishing house willing
to publish Gadsby, so after two years, he

00:02:47.511 --> 00:02:52.450
sought out a vanity publisher to self-publish
it, settling on Wetzel Publishing Co. in Los

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:53.470
Angeles.

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:57.550
Unfortunately for him, two things happened
to stop the book from becoming widely published

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:59.200
or even reviewed at all.

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.820
First, the fact that there was a fire at Wetzel’s
warehouse, which resulted in not only a firefighter

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:08.060
losing his life in the blaze, but also the
vast majority of the copies of Gadsby being

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:09.099
destroyed.

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:13.099
The second thing that happened was Wright
himself died just two months after publishing

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:15.450
the book at the age of 67.

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:19.890
With no one left to promote it and few copies
in existence, it faded into obscurity for

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:23.010
a time, but has gained in popularity over
the years.

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:27.480
Today Gadsby is considered something of a
classic, albeit in the “oddity” category,

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:30.000
rather than for its literative qualities.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.569
Nevertheless, thanks to its notoriety and
scarcity, a first edition copy of Gadsby,

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:39.020
even one in poor condition, tends to cost
around $4,000-$5,000.

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:43.240
Bonus Facts:
• Gadsby wasn’t the only classic not to

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:44.890
be appreciated in its time.

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:50.340
Moby Dick only sold 3000 copies over a 40
year span (during the author, Herman Melville’s,

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:55.590
lifetime), making Melville only $556.37.

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:58.980
It was also largely overlooked critically.

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:00.870
• Works like Gadsby are called lipograms.

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:06.120
A lipogram is basically just a form of writing
where the author purposefully excludes a letter

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:07.870
or symbol from their text.

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:12.720
‘Lipogram’ comes from the Greek ‘leipográmmatos’,
more or less meaning “leaving a letter out”.

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:15.269
Another type of lipogram is a pangrammatic
lipogram.

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:19.310
This is where you write something (usually
something very short, like a single sentence)

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:24.700
that includes every letter of the alphabet,
except one.

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:28.540
• Little is known of Ernest Wright beyond
some details surrounding Gadsby and that he

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:33.300
wrote three other books, The Wonderful Fairies
of the Sun in 1896, The Fairies That Run the

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:38.740
World and How They Do It in 1903, and Thoughts
and Reveries of an American Bluejacket in

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:39.740
1918.

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:44.680
He also wrote a comedic poem that became mildly
popular, “When Father Carves the Duck”.

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:47.690
As to what he did with the rest of his life,
there are conflicting accounts.

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:52.240
He was either English or American, and may
or may not have been in the navy or otherwise

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:53.240
a sailor.

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:57.510
It is known that he attended M.I.T.’s School
of Mechanic Arts, which had a two year program

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:59.000
for high school students.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.510
Instead of taking normal high school classes,
this program focused on educating teens with

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:07.330
practical skills like metallurgy, carpentry,
and the like.

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:10.830
It isn’t known whether he graduated though,
because they listed him as a “special student”

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:17.580
in his second year and no direct record of
him graduating exists.

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:23.570
• Georges Perec published a 250 page book,
La Disparition, in French which also doesn’t

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:24.590
contain the letter ‘e’.

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:26.400
This book was later translated into English.

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:30.800
The English translation conformed to the same
restriction as the French version, lacking

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:45.900
any instance of the letter ‘e’.
