00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:06.220
We're on problem 63.

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:10.130
Carlotta can drive from her home
to her office by one of

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:11.800
two possible routes.

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:15.370
If she must also return by one
of these routes, what is the

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:17.620
distance of the shorter route?

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:21.480
So essentially she has a long
route to go to her office,

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.820
that's her home, that's
her office.

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:27.820
And then she has a short route,
with fewer curves,

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:29.510
that's my guess.

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:33.380
And she can go and come
back by one of two--

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:38.220
Statement number one: when she
drives from her home to her

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:41.020
office by the shorter route
and returns by the longer

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:43.800
route, she drives a total
of 42 kilometers.

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.690
So when she goes this, way
shorter route this way and

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:50.500
then longer route back,
it's 42 kilometers.

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:56.490
So shorter plus longer
is equal to 42.

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:59.160
And that by itself doesn't let
me know what the distance of

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.380
the shorter route is.

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:05.459
Statement number two: when she
drives both ways from her home

00:01:05.459 --> 00:01:08.790
to her office and back by the
longer route, she drives a

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.890
total of 46 kilometers.

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.350
So if she goes by the longer
route and then by the longer

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.250
route again, so 2 times a longer
route is equal to 46

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:20.000
kilometers.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.020
Well, this by itself helps me
figure out what the longer

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:25.090
route is, but they want to
know the distance of the

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.560
shorter route.

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.380
So this, I could just eyeball
this, the longer route is 23

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:29.240
kilometers.

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.100
But if you want to know the
distance of the shorter route

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.960
you would need this information
as well.

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.100
The shorter route plus
23 is equal to 42.

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.510
So the shorter route
is 19 kilometers.

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:42.200
So you need both of
the statements.

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.070
Both statements are sufficient,
but one by

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.590
themselves are not enough
to figure out what the

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:47.370
shorter route is.

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:49.000
If they ask for the longer
route, just statement two

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.890
could have been good enough.

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:52.300
Next question.

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:54.780
64.

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.050
Is x greater than y?

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:04.770
My computer's updating
something.

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.500
It's a little bit-- Is
x greater than y?

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:17.580
Statement number one tells us
that x is equal to y plus 2.

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:18.880
Well, let me think about that.

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:22.820
No matter what y is, x is
going to be 2 more.

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:25.610
Even if y is a negative million,
x is still going to

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:26.650
be a bigger number.

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:29.460
It's going to be 2 more than
negative a million.

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:31.780
If it's y is negative 10,
this will be negative 8.

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:34.500
No matter what x will
be greater than y.

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.700
So statement one
is sufficient.

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:50.322
Statement number two: x/2
is equal to y minus 1.

00:02:50.322 --> 00:02:50.730
OK.

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.810
This doesn't look
as clear there.

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:56.640
So x is equal to 2y minus 2.

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.200
So we just have to come up with
a condition, one y where

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.770
y is less than x and another y
where y is greater than x and

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:03.950
then we would have
proven our point.

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:05.060
So let's think about it.

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:09.590
When y is 0-- this is using
statement number two-- when y

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:11.180
is 0, what's x?

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:14.220
x is minus 2.

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:18.970
So that's a statement where
y is greater than x.

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:25.030
And then when y is equal
to 10, what's x?

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:27.840
x is 18.

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:32.370
So this is a statement where
y is less than x.

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:35.060
So statement number two actually
tells us nothing

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:39.060
about whether x is greater than
y or y is greater than x.

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:40.540
So statement number
two is useless.

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:44.660
Statement number one, alone,
is sufficient.

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:45.910
Next problem.

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:51.260
65.

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.895
If m is an integer is m odd?

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:08.550
Statement number one: m divided
by 2 not-- they write

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:12.250
it real big and bold--
not even integer.

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:18.790
Well, that doesn't
tell me much.

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:21.120
I mean that doesn't tell
me that this is odd.

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:24.510
In fact, it's not an even
integer but if this was an odd

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:27.470
integer then that means that m
is an even integer, right?

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:32.550
Anything that's divisible by 2
and results in an integer--

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:34.820
right, that's essentially saying
that it's divisible by

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:37.150
2-- by definition is
going to be even.

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:40.400
So for example, what
if m divided by 2

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:41.590
is equal to 3, right?

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:46.900
3 is not an even integer but
still m would equal 6.

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:50.130
And then m would be even.

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:52.480
And I mean they're not
telling us much here.

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:57.210
m divided by 2 could be equal
to 2.5 in which case m would

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:58.850
be equal to 5 so that would
be an odd integer.

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:02.000
So this by itself doesn't give
me much information.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.480
Statement number two: m minus
3 is an even integer.

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:13.710
Well, this is useful, right?

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:20.150
If you subtract an odd number
from a number and you get an

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:24.310
even number, this number
is going to be even.

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:25.600
And let's think about that.

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:27.470
If I have an even number--
let me just

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:29.800
write a bunch of numbers.

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:33.410
Let me write x, y, and z.

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:35.600
And let's say they're
consecutive, right?

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:37.530
Actually let me write
it even better.

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:46.720
Let's say that x is even--
let's say x is odd.

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:48.450
Then x plus 1 is going
to be what?

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:49.880
It's going to be even, right?

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:51.390
The next number will be even.

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:55.650
Then x plus 2 is going
to be odd.

00:05:55.650 --> 00:06:02.520
And then x plus 3 is
going to be even.

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:04.450
And then if you go the other
way-- actually I should have

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:09.060
gone to the way first-- x
minus 1 would be even.

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:11.650
x minus 2 would be odd.

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:15.020
And x minus 3 would
be even, right?

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:21.170
If you have an odd number and
you subtract out an odd number

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:23.210
and you get an even number
then this number

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:24.910
is going to be odd.

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:27.960
So this statement two by itself
is actually sufficient.

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:29.620
And play around with some
numbers if that intuition

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:30.900
doesn't make sense.

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:34.540
Statement two, by itself, is
sufficient to solve this

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:37.360
problem and you don't need
statement one at all.

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:38.610
Next problem.

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:45.330
66.

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:48.240
what is the area of the
triangular region ABC above?

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:51.370
Well, they've drawn us a little
triangle so I will draw

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:51.935
us a triangle.

00:06:51.935 --> 00:06:57.140
Let's see, we have our
base and then, it

00:06:57.140 --> 00:06:59.180
looks pretty symmetric.

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:01.900
I'll try to draw it the
way they drew it.

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:09.230
One end, that's the other end,
and then this is the altitude.

00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:11.370
Good enough.

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:21.890
And then they label
it A, B, C, D.

00:07:21.890 --> 00:07:24.600
This is a right angle.

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:27.240
This is x degrees.

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:30.340
Alright, what is the area of
the triangular region?

00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:34.860
So area of a triangle is base
times height times 1/2.

00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:38.070
So if we can do that then
we're all done.

00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:42.670
One: the product of
BD and AC is 20.

00:07:42.670 --> 00:07:52.080
So BD times AC-- oh no, sorry,
BD times AC, oh that's it.

00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:53.230
So BD is the height.

00:07:53.230 --> 00:07:59.030
So area, let me just write it,
area is equal to 1/2 times

00:07:59.030 --> 00:08:05.970
this altitude, BD, times the
base, times AC, right?

00:08:05.970 --> 00:08:10.130
Statement number one, they tell
us what BD times AC is.

00:08:10.130 --> 00:08:16.690
They tell us that BD times
AC is equal to 20.

00:08:16.690 --> 00:08:19.370
So that immediately follows, if
this thing is equal to 20

00:08:19.370 --> 00:08:20.460
then the area is equal to 10.

00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:21.680
And you didn't even have
to figure that out.

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:25.800
So statement number one, by
itself, is sufficient.

00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:31.450
Statement number two: x is
equal to 45 degrees.

00:08:31.450 --> 00:08:33.890
This one's a little bit
more interesting.

00:08:33.890 --> 00:08:37.309
x is equal to 45 degrees.

00:08:37.309 --> 00:08:40.370
Well, I mean we could do a
little angle game, we could

00:08:40.370 --> 00:08:43.929
say, OK, this is a 90 degree
angle and we could say if this

00:08:43.929 --> 00:08:48.550
is 90, this is 45, and this is
going to be 45-- actually

00:08:48.550 --> 00:08:50.260
that's about where
we could stop.

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:53.770
And this tells us no information
about what any of

00:08:53.770 --> 00:08:56.930
the sides are so you could
imagine if this is 45 degrees,

00:08:56.930 --> 00:09:00.180
but this could be a million mile
high triangle or it could

00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:01.790
be a nanometer high triangle.

00:09:01.790 --> 00:09:02.330
We don't know.

00:09:02.330 --> 00:09:03.280
It could be of any size.

00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:04.280
You could scale it up or down.

00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:06.850
This just tells us the degree
and the angle information.

00:09:06.850 --> 00:09:08.260
So two, by itself, is useless.

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:11.800
So for this one, statement one,
alone, is sufficient to

00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:15.270
answer this problem, A.

00:09:15.270 --> 00:09:18.190
Next problem.

00:09:18.190 --> 00:09:21.170
67.

00:09:21.170 --> 00:09:23.810
What is the value of b plus c?

00:09:28.220 --> 00:09:41.050
Alright, number one: they tell
us that ab plus cd plus ac

00:09:41.050 --> 00:09:45.410
plus bd is equal to 6.

00:09:45.410 --> 00:09:47.400
And this by itself doesn't help
us much because there's

00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:50.320
all these a's and d's here and
they could be anything.

00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:52.670
So we can't solve
for b plus c.

00:09:52.670 --> 00:09:55.020
But I'm already suspecting that
we could factor out the

00:09:55.020 --> 00:09:56.820
a's and d's somewhere.

00:09:56.820 --> 00:10:00.150
So we can factor out the b's
plus c's, then we might be

00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:02.770
able to figure out the numbers
if we're given more

00:10:02.770 --> 00:10:04.920
information about a and d.

00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:07.260
Statement two, and they give
us more information about a

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:10.255
and d. a plus d is equal to 4.

00:10:10.255 --> 00:10:12.830
So let me see if I can simplify
this top one.

00:10:12.830 --> 00:10:16.080
Let me see if I can factor out
a bunch of b plus c's.

00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:20.370
So if we think about
it, let me think.

00:10:20.370 --> 00:10:24.030
So if you take this term and
that term and you factor out

00:10:24.030 --> 00:10:29.830
the a you get a-- let me do it
in a different color-- so this

00:10:29.830 --> 00:10:37.910
term and that term is equal to a
times what? b plus c, right?

00:10:37.910 --> 00:10:40.750
You can multiply that out
and you get ab plus ac.

00:10:40.750 --> 00:10:42.720
And then plus, and let's
do the same thing

00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:45.590
with this term, d.

00:10:45.590 --> 00:10:49.170
That's d times c plus b.

00:10:49.170 --> 00:10:53.180
But we can switch the order,
b plus c-- and if you don't

00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:55.540
believe me that this equals
this, multiply it out.

00:10:55.540 --> 00:10:59.340
All I did is I grouped the ab
and the ac terms and then

00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:04.120
factored out the a and then I
grouped the cd and the bd

00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:06.150
terms and factored out the d.

00:11:06.150 --> 00:11:10.190
And then now we can factor
out a b plus c.

00:11:10.190 --> 00:11:13.730
We can do the reverse
distributive property again.

00:11:13.730 --> 00:11:21.615
So now this equals a plus
d times b plus c, right?

00:11:21.615 --> 00:11:24.380
And if you don't believe me,
just multiply b plus c times a

00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:27.800
and then b plus c times d
and you get that, right?

00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:29.740
That's just the distributive
property.

00:11:29.740 --> 00:11:32.820
But now we're ready to solve
because they told us that this

00:11:32.820 --> 00:11:37.630
thing's equal to 6 and they
tell us that this thing is

00:11:37.630 --> 00:11:39.760
equal to 4.

00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:43.980
So b plus c is going to be equal
to 6/4 or 1 and 1/2.

00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:44.950
And we're done.

00:11:44.950 --> 00:11:47.070
You need both statements
together.

00:11:47.070 --> 00:11:48.940
Both statements, together,
are sufficient

00:11:48.940 --> 00:11:51.000
to solve this problem.
