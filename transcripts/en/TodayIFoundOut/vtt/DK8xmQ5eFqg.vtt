00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:15.559
Corsets dominated the undergarments of wealthier
women in the Western world for centuries,

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:17.220
until WWI.

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.300
So how did the war help popularize the bra?

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:23.840
In a word, or two words in this case: metal
shortage.

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:26.630
The making of corsets required quite a bit
of metal.

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:32.480
Thus, in 1917, the U.S. War Industries Board
asked American women to help their “men

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:36.030
win the war” by not wearing or buying corsets.

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.300
This may seem like it would only make a small
difference; but, in fact, during the war it

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:46.400
is estimated that they freed up around 28,000
tons of steel by this change.

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:51.359
(Similar reasoning later led to the banning
of pre-sliced bread in the U.S. during WWII,

00:00:51.359 --> 00:00:52.720
with much less success.)

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:57.530
Besides conserving resources, other aspects
of the war also contributed to the demise

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:00.329
of the corset and the rise of the bra.

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.890
For instance, during the war, American women
found themselves working in factories, places

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:10.350
where it simply wasn’t possible to function
properly wearing an ultra-tight, ultra-restrictive

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:11.350
corset.

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:15.830
Still needing some support in these active
jobs, the bra became the most used alternative.

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:20.880
By the end of the war, fashion-conscious women
in North America and Europe were now mostly

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.970
wearing brassieres and soon mass-production
of bras ramped up, despite their no longer

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:31.150
being metal shortages nor were as many women
still working factories and the like.

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:34.370
Women in Asia, Africa, and Latin America followed
the trend.

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:38.840
The reason the switch was more or less made
permanent was that corsets were designed to

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:45.500
accentuate the curvy Victorian ideal of beauty
by cinching the waist and boosting the breasts.

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.960
In the process, this made it very difficult
to breathe and squeezed women’s waists so

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:55.050
much that it could even displace organs and
cause certain internal problems, along with

00:01:55.050 --> 00:02:00.549
symptoms such as fainting, gynecological issues,
flushing, and nausea, among others.

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:04.290
With corsets out, women could move and breathe
again.

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.940
So who invented the first bra?

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:10.700
Wearing a specialized garment to support a
woman’s breasts dates as far back as at

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:16.050
least the 14th century BC in Greece where
women wore a band of wool or linen that was

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:19.260
wrapped across the breasts and tied or pinned
in the back.

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:24.200
Depictions of these first bras can be seen
in wall drawing in Crete, worn by female athletes

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:25.840
during athletic events.

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:30.770
The women in this civilization also seem to
have often worn bra-like clothing items that

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:35.810
were actually designed to expose the breasts,
while also pushing them up and making them

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:37.010
more prominent.

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:41.190
As to the modern bra, it isn’t clear who
was the first to invent it as numerous patents

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:46.820
in various nations were filed in the mid-19th
to early 20th centuries concerning bras.

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:51.380
Along with the official patent records, an
early 19th century push-up bra was recently

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:56.400
discovered in the London Science Museum storage
rooms; so even before they were being patented,

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:01.430
at least some intrepid women seem to have
been wearing something like a modern bra design.

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:06.390
The apparent “first” modern bra design
patented in the U.S. was made by Caresse Crosby,

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:10.530
born Mary Phelps Jacob, who invented her design
in 1910.

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:15.341
She got the idea for her bra when she was
just 19 years old and heading to a ball.

00:03:15.341 --> 00:03:17.310
Her dress for the evening was a sheer gown.

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:21.760
Owing to her large breast size, the dress
and a corset didn’t work- the whale bone

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.310
in the corset stuck out of her dress at the
top.

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:28.440
She then, with the help of her maid, took
two handkerchiefs and some ribbon and sewed

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:33.220
them together to make something like a modern
day bra, so she would still have support but

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:34.920
not need to wear the corset.

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:39.099
After her bra being the talk of the party,
with several women requesting she make bras

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:44.470
for them, she decided to make a business out
of it and patented her “backless brassiere”,

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:48.590
with the patent being approved on November
3, 1914.

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:53.120
She initially didn’t have much luck selling
her bra and decided to close down the business,

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:56.850
selling the patent rights to Warners Brothers
Corset Company of Connecticut.

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:02.870
From the sale she profited $1,500, which is
approximately $30,000 today.

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:07.849
Not bad, until you consider that Warners Brothers
Co. managed to do quite a bit better with

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:14.739
the patent, ultimately earning an estimated
$15 million, $200-$300 million today, from

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:17.010
it in the following three decades.

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:21.989
Various advancements were made on these early
bras, reflecting the shifting fashion trends.

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:27.550
In the 1920s, the flat chested, flapper look
was queen, and bra styles reflected this.

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:32.240
Soon a full chested look, not unlike what
was produced by corsets, became popular again.

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:37.499
In 1947, Frederick Mellinger, founder of Frederick’s
of Hollywood, introduced his design for the

00:04:37.499 --> 00:04:42.330
padded bra; a year later, his design for the
modern push up bra came out which was called

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:43.999
“Rising Star”.

00:04:43.999 --> 00:04:48.729
Before 1950, Mellinger would also introduce
us to the front hook bra and more colorful

00:04:48.729 --> 00:04:49.729
brassieres.

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:55.750
In 1977, Lisa Lindahl and her childhood friend,
Polly Smith, fashioned the modern day sports

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:57.949
bra out of two jock straps (seriously).

00:04:57.949 --> 00:05:02.199
They teamed up with clothing designer Hinda
Miller and soon the “Jogbra” was available

00:05:02.199 --> 00:05:03.430
to the general public.

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:08.110
That same year Victoria’s Secret was founded
by Stanford MBA, Roy Raymond.

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:13.909
How we size bras wasn’t invented until the
late 1920s or 1930s, with some contention

00:05:13.909 --> 00:05:17.469
over who actually invented the modern sizing
system.

00:05:17.469 --> 00:05:21.189
Some historians credit William Rosenthal and
his wife Ida.

00:05:21.189 --> 00:05:22.660
Others claim it was S.H.

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:27.289
Camp and Company who introduced the A, B,
C, D letter sizing, with documented evidence

00:05:27.289 --> 00:05:32.930
of Camp and Co.’s claim appearing in early
1930s ad campaigns showing such sizing.

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:37.789
Whoever was really first, the brassiere sizing
system, at least as far as the terminology

00:05:37.789 --> 00:05:41.240
went, soon caught on with other bra manufactures.

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:45.659
Before this, bras tended to come in a mostly
one size fits all variety, using stretchable

00:05:45.659 --> 00:05:49.710
material in the cup to accommodate women of
varying sizes.

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:53.939
The sizing method that was come up with, which
by the way is not standard from nation to

00:05:53.939 --> 00:05:58.930
nation, and can even vary somewhat from manufacturer
to manufacturer, consists of two measurements

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:03.650
– a linear measurement measuring underneath
the breasts and around the ribcage, and then

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:09.069
a second measurement, measuring the bra cup
size itself, which is measured in volume.

00:06:09.069 --> 00:06:14.490
In this system, an A cup generally can hold
around 8 fluid ounces; a B cup around 13 fluid

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:21.309
ounces; a C cup around 21 fluid ounces; and
a D cup around 27 fluid ounces.

00:06:21.309 --> 00:06:26.710
Not surprisingly, considering the slight variance
in sizing from bra maker to bra maker and

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:31.259
country to country, as well as the fact that
weight fluctuation in a woman, even as little

00:06:31.259 --> 00:06:36.520
as 5-10 pounds, effect bra size, the general
consensus is that the vast majority of women

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:39.189
out there wear the incorrect bra size.

00:06:39.189 --> 00:06:43.199
Because of this, it’s often recommended
that every single time you go bra shopping,

00:06:43.199 --> 00:06:49.839
you get re-measured and have a sizing expert
make sure a given bra actually is fitting

00:06:49.839 --> 00:06:50.839
you correctly.

00:06:50.839 --> 00:06:54.439
The world’s biggest breast augmentation
is 38KKK.

00:06:54.439 --> 00:06:59.569
Those mammoth mammaries are sported by Sheyla
Hershey, originally from Brazil, taking her

00:06:59.569 --> 00:07:01.940
10 different surgeries to get up to that size.

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:05.379
Sheyla’s goal is to some day get her boobs
up to 38MMM.

00:07:05.379 --> 00:07:08.849
While her reasoning behind the surgeries may
be essentially vanity (wanting to hold and

00:07:08.849 --> 00:07:14.599
keep the world record), Sheyla claims her
38KKK breasts once saved her life during a

00:07:14.599 --> 00:07:17.050
car accident where she wasn’t wearing her
seatbelt.

00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:20.619
Her implants functioned something like an
air bag, keeping her from smashing her head

00:07:20.619 --> 00:07:22.199
on the dash or windshield.

00:07:22.199 --> 00:07:26.569
Lucky for her, considering the volume of fluids
in them, during the accident, her implants

00:07:26.569 --> 00:07:39.099
did no burst.
