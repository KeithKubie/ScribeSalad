00:00:00.002 --> 00:00:00.915
- [Voiceover] So, I've talked about

00:00:00.915 --> 00:00:04.266
the partial derivative
and how you compute it,

00:00:04.266 --> 00:00:06.223
how you interpret in terms of graphs,

00:00:06.223 --> 00:00:09.070
but what I'd like to do here
is give its formal definition.

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:10.771
So, it's the kind of
thing, just to remind you,

00:00:10.771 --> 00:00:14.294
that applies to a function that
has a multi-variable input.

00:00:14.294 --> 00:00:16.401
So, X, Y, and you know,
I'll emphasize that

00:00:16.401 --> 00:00:19.153
it could actually be a
number of other inputs.

00:00:19.153 --> 00:00:21.177
You could have 100 inputs, or something

00:00:21.177 --> 00:00:24.006
like that, and as with
a lot of things here,

00:00:24.006 --> 00:00:25.233
I think it's helpful to take a look at

00:00:25.233 --> 00:00:28.058
the one dimensional
analogy and think about

00:00:28.058 --> 00:00:32.169
how we define the derivative,
just the ordinary derivative,

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:34.252
when you have a function
that's just one variable.

00:00:34.252 --> 00:00:36.455
You know, this would be
just something simple,

00:00:36.455 --> 00:00:38.967
F of X, and you know, if you're thinking

00:00:38.967 --> 00:00:42.437
in the back of your mind that
it's a function like F of X

00:00:42.437 --> 00:00:45.212
equals X squared, and
the way to think about

00:00:45.212 --> 00:00:47.647
the definition of this is
to just actually spell out

00:00:47.647 --> 00:00:49.832
how we interpret this
D F and D X, and then

00:00:49.832 --> 00:00:52.851
slowly start to tighten it
up into a formalization.

00:00:52.851 --> 00:00:55.126
So, you might be thinking of
the graph of this function.

00:00:55.126 --> 00:00:57.655
You know, maybe it's some
kind of curve, and when you

00:00:57.655 --> 00:00:59.739
think of evaluating it
at some point, you know,

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:02.793
let's say you're
evaluating it at a point A,

00:01:02.793 --> 00:01:07.103
you're imagining D X here as
representing a slight nudge,

00:01:07.103 --> 00:01:09.621
just a slight nudge in the input value.

00:01:09.621 --> 00:01:11.369
So, this is in the X direction.

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.079
Got your X coordinate, your output,

00:01:14.079 --> 00:01:17.687
F of X is what the Y axis
represents here, and then

00:01:17.687 --> 00:01:21.568
you're thinking of D F as
being the resulting nudge here,

00:01:21.568 --> 00:01:23.832
the resulting change to the function.

00:01:23.832 --> 00:01:26.281
So, when we formalize this,
we're gonna be thinking of

00:01:26.281 --> 00:01:30.434
a fraction that's gonna
represent D F over D X, and I'll

00:01:30.434 --> 00:01:31.594
leave myself some room.

00:01:31.594 --> 00:01:34.328
You can probably anticipate
why if you know where

00:01:34.328 --> 00:01:38.370
this is going, and instead
of saying D X, I'll say H.

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:41.284
So instead of thinking
D X is that tiny nudge,

00:01:41.284 --> 00:01:45.243
you'll think H, and I'm not
sure why H is used necessarily,

00:01:45.243 --> 00:01:47.379
but just having some
kind of variable that you

00:01:47.379 --> 00:01:49.637
think of as getting
small, maybe all the other

00:01:49.637 --> 00:01:51.224
letters in the alphabet were taken.

00:01:51.224 --> 00:01:53.024
Now, when you actually
say, what do we mean by

00:01:53.024 --> 00:01:56.565
the resulting change in
F, we should be writing,

00:01:56.565 --> 00:02:00.108
as well, where does it go after you nudge?

00:02:00.108 --> 00:02:02.590
So, when you take, you
know, from that input point,

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:05.077
plus that nudge, plus that little H,

00:02:05.077 --> 00:02:07.353
what's the difference
between that and the original

00:02:07.353 --> 00:02:10.003
function, or the original value of

00:02:10.003 --> 00:02:11.855
the function, at that point?

00:02:11.855 --> 00:02:15.201
So, this top part is really
what's representing D F.

00:02:15.201 --> 00:02:19.194
You know, this is what's
representing D F over here,

00:02:19.194 --> 00:02:21.633
but you don't do this for
any actual value of H.

00:02:21.633 --> 00:02:24.656
You don't do it for any specific nudge.

00:02:24.656 --> 00:02:27.074
Largely, the whole point
of calculus is that you're

00:02:27.074 --> 00:02:31.702
considering the limit as
H goes to zero of this,

00:02:31.702 --> 00:02:35.078
and this is what makes
concrete the idea of, you know,

00:02:35.078 --> 00:02:37.496
a tiny little nudge or a
tiny little resulting change.

00:02:37.496 --> 00:02:39.548
It's not that it's any specific one.

00:02:39.548 --> 00:02:41.586
You're taking the limit,
and you know, you could

00:02:41.586 --> 00:02:43.428
get into the formal definition of a limit,

00:02:43.428 --> 00:02:45.602
but it gives you room for rigor as soon as

00:02:45.602 --> 00:02:47.219
you start writing something like this.

00:02:47.219 --> 00:02:52.004
Now, over in the multi-variable
world, very similar story.

00:02:52.004 --> 00:02:54.491
We can pretty much do the
same thing, and we're gonna

00:02:54.491 --> 00:02:56.585
look at our original
fraction, and just start

00:02:56.585 --> 00:02:59.165
to formalize what we think of each of

00:02:59.165 --> 00:03:01.212
these variables as representing.

00:03:01.212 --> 00:03:03.940
That partial X, still it's
common to use the letter H,

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:05.269
just to represent a tiny nudge in

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:07.459
the X direction, and now if we think about

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:09.881
what is that nudge, and here, let me

00:03:09.881 --> 00:03:11.303
draw it out, actually.

00:03:11.303 --> 00:03:13.607
The way that I kinda
like to draw this out is

00:03:13.607 --> 00:03:16.601
you think of your entire input space as,

00:03:16.601 --> 00:03:17.639
you know, the X Y plane.

00:03:17.639 --> 00:03:18.927
If it was more variables, this would be

00:03:18.927 --> 00:03:20.606
a high dimensional space,
and you're thinking

00:03:20.606 --> 00:03:22.905
at some point, you know,
maybe you're thinking of it

00:03:22.905 --> 00:03:26.044
as A B, or maybe I should specify that,

00:03:26.044 --> 00:03:28.172
actually, where we're doing this

00:03:28.172 --> 00:03:31.339
at a specific point how you define it.

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:34.756
We're doing this at a very specific point,

00:03:34.756 --> 00:03:38.128
A B, and when you're
thinking of your tiny little

00:03:38.128 --> 00:03:40.505
change in X, you'd be thinking, you know,

00:03:40.505 --> 00:03:43.258
a tiny little nudge in the X direction,

00:03:43.258 --> 00:03:46.307
a tiny little shift there,
and the entire function

00:03:46.307 --> 00:03:49.119
maps that input space, whatever it is, to

00:03:49.119 --> 00:03:50.501
the real number line.

00:03:50.501 --> 00:03:52.975
This is your output
space, and you're saying,

00:03:52.975 --> 00:03:55.726
hey, how does that tiny
nudge influence the output?

00:03:55.726 --> 00:03:58.376
I've drawn this diagram
a lot, this loose sketch.

00:03:58.376 --> 00:03:59.446
I think it's actually a pretty good model,

00:03:59.446 --> 00:04:00.710
because once we start thinking of

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:02.577
higher dimensional outputs
or things like that,

00:04:02.577 --> 00:04:04.594
it's pretty flexible, and
you're thinking of this

00:04:04.594 --> 00:04:06.849
as your partial X, your changing

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:09.127
the X direction, and
this is that resulting

00:04:09.127 --> 00:04:10.953
change for the function.

00:04:10.953 --> 00:04:12.367
But, we go back up here, and we say,

00:04:12.367 --> 00:04:13.595
well what does that mean, right?

00:04:13.595 --> 00:04:16.879
If H represents that tiny
change to your X value,

00:04:16.879 --> 00:04:21.729
well then you have to evaluate
the function at the point A,

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:24.853
but plus that H, and you're adding it

00:04:24.853 --> 00:04:26.811
to the X value, that first component,

00:04:26.811 --> 00:04:28.736
just because this is
the partial derivative

00:04:28.736 --> 00:04:31.629
with respect to X, and the point B

00:04:31.629 --> 00:04:33.689
just remains unchanged, right?

00:04:33.689 --> 00:04:36.396
So, this is you evaluating it, kind of, at

00:04:36.396 --> 00:04:37.971
the new point, and you have to say,

00:04:37.971 --> 00:04:40.073
what's the difference
between that and the old

00:04:40.073 --> 00:04:44.233
evaluation, where it was just at A and B.

00:04:44.233 --> 00:04:45.191
And that's it.

00:04:45.191 --> 00:04:49.623
That's the formal definition
of your partial derivative,

00:04:49.623 --> 00:04:51.767
except, oh, the most
important part, right?

00:04:51.767 --> 00:04:53.305
The most important part, given that

00:04:53.305 --> 00:04:55.743
this is calculus is that
we're not doing this

00:04:55.743 --> 00:04:59.743
for any specific value
of H, but we're actually,

00:05:01.415 --> 00:05:02.853
let me just move this guy.

00:05:02.853 --> 00:05:05.482
Give a little bit of room here.

00:05:05.482 --> 00:05:06.515
Yes.

00:05:06.515 --> 00:05:07.973
But, we're actually taking the limit

00:05:07.973 --> 00:05:10.556
here, limit, as H goes to zero,

00:05:13.459 --> 00:05:15.612
and what this means is you're
not considering any specific

00:05:15.612 --> 00:05:17.981
size of D X, any specific size of this.

00:05:17.981 --> 00:05:20.703
Really, this is H, considering
the notation up here,

00:05:20.703 --> 00:05:22.398
but any size for that partial X.

00:05:22.398 --> 00:05:24.392
You're imagining that nudge shrinking

00:05:24.392 --> 00:05:26.706
more and more and more,
and the resulting change

00:05:26.706 --> 00:05:28.123
shrinks more and more and more, and you're

00:05:28.123 --> 00:05:31.390
wondering what the ratio
between them approaches.

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:32.829
So, that would be the partial derivative

00:05:32.829 --> 00:05:35.028
with respect to X, and just for practice,

00:05:35.028 --> 00:05:36.872
let's actually write out
what the partial derivative

00:05:36.872 --> 00:05:38.367
with respect to Y would be.

00:05:38.367 --> 00:05:39.660
So, we'll get rid of some of this

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:41.952
one dimensional analogy stuff here.

00:05:41.952 --> 00:05:44.349
Don't need that anymore,
and let's just think about

00:05:44.349 --> 00:05:47.660
what the partial
derivative with respect to

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:49.298
a different variable would be.

00:05:49.298 --> 00:05:51.553
So, if we were doing it
as partial derivative

00:05:51.553 --> 00:05:55.800
of F with respect to Y,
now we're nudging slightly

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:57.000
in the other direction, right?

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.413
We're nudging in the Y
direction, and you'd be thinking,

00:05:59.413 --> 00:06:01.842
okay, so we're still
gonna divide something

00:06:01.842 --> 00:06:03.610
by that nudge, and again I'm
just using the same variable.

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:05.892
Maybe it would be clearer
to write something like

00:06:05.892 --> 00:06:08.364
the change in Y, or to
go up here and write

00:06:08.364 --> 00:06:09.897
something like, you know, the change

00:06:09.897 --> 00:06:12.912
in X, and people will do
that, but it's less common.

00:06:12.912 --> 00:06:14.477
I think people just kinda want

00:06:14.477 --> 00:06:17.600
the standard go-to limiting variable.

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:18.923
But, this time when you're considering

00:06:18.923 --> 00:06:21.840
what is the resulting
change, oh, and again,

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:24.998
I always forget to write
in we're evaluating this

00:06:24.998 --> 00:06:28.748
at a specific point, at
a specific point A B,

00:06:34.542 --> 00:06:35.694
and as a result, maybe I'll give myself

00:06:35.694 --> 00:06:38.335
a little bit more room here.

00:06:38.335 --> 00:06:41.847
So, we're taking this whole thing,

00:06:41.847 --> 00:06:45.040
dividing by H, but what is
the resulting change in F?

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:49.310
This time you say F, the new
value is still gonna be at A,

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:51.941
but the change happens
for that second variable.

00:06:51.941 --> 00:06:54.508
It's gonna be that B, B plus H.

00:06:54.508 --> 00:06:56.060
So, you're adding that nudge to

00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:58.835
the Y value, and as
before, you subtract off.

00:06:58.835 --> 00:07:00.774
You see the difference
between that and how you

00:07:00.774 --> 00:07:04.095
evaluate it at the
original point, and again,

00:07:04.095 --> 00:07:06.194
the whole reason I move
this over and give myself

00:07:06.194 --> 00:07:09.218
some room is because
we're taking the limit,

00:07:09.218 --> 00:07:12.637
as this H goes to zero, and the way that

00:07:12.637 --> 00:07:14.058
you're thinking about
this is very similar.

00:07:14.058 --> 00:07:15.746
It's just that when you change the input

00:07:15.746 --> 00:07:19.301
by adding H to the Y value,
you're shifting it upwards.

00:07:19.301 --> 00:07:22.532
So, again, this is the partial derivative,

00:07:22.532 --> 00:07:24.797
the formal definition of
the partial derivative.

00:07:24.797 --> 00:07:26.624
Looks very similar to
the formal definition of

00:07:26.624 --> 00:07:30.267
the derivative, but I just
always think about this

00:07:30.267 --> 00:07:32.325
as spelling out what we mean by

00:07:32.325 --> 00:07:35.031
partial Y and partial F,
and kinda spelling out

00:07:35.031 --> 00:07:36.876
why it is that the Leibniz's came up

00:07:36.876 --> 00:07:38.757
with this notation in the first place.

00:07:38.757 --> 00:07:40.858
Well, I don't know if Leibniz
came up with the partials,

00:07:40.858 --> 00:07:44.548
but the D F, D X portion, and this is good

00:07:44.548 --> 00:07:45.829
to keep in the back of your mind,

00:07:45.829 --> 00:07:47.697
especially as we introduce new notions,

00:07:47.697 --> 00:07:50.155
new types of multi-variable derivatives,

00:07:50.155 --> 00:07:51.627
like the directional derivative.

00:07:51.627 --> 00:07:54.227
 I think it helps clarify
what's really go on

00:07:54.227 --> 00:07:55.454
in certain contexts.

00:07:55.454 --> 00:07:56.380
Great.

00:07:56.380 --> 00:07:57.213
See ya next video.
