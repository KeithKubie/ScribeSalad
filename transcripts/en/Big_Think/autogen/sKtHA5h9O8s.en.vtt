I often get questions about what it's

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:05.140
I often get questions about what it's
 

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:06.630
I often get questions about what it's
like being a woman in science which has

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:06.640
like being a woman in science which has
 

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:08.460
like being a woman in science which has
traditionally been a field dominated by

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:08.470
traditionally been a field dominated by
 

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:10.829
traditionally been a field dominated by
men and the interesting thing is the

00:00:10.829 --> 00:00:10.839
men and the interesting thing is the
 

00:00:10.839 --> 00:00:13.440
men and the interesting thing is the
complexity of that to me because I grew

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:13.450
complexity of that to me because I grew
 

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:15.239
complexity of that to me because I grew
up in the 1980s I went to college in the

00:00:15.239 --> 00:00:15.249
up in the 1980s I went to college in the
 

00:00:15.249 --> 00:00:18.330
up in the 1980s I went to college in the
1990s and that certainly was after the

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:18.340
1990s and that certainly was after the
 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:19.980
1990s and that certainly was after the
era at least for the most part where

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:19.990
era at least for the most part where
 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:22.050
era at least for the most part where
women were just told point blank you

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:22.060
women were just told point blank you
 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:23.519
women were just told point blank you
shouldn't be here you can't be a

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:23.529
shouldn't be here you can't be a
 

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:25.019
shouldn't be here you can't be a
scientist you don't belong here

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:25.029
scientist you don't belong here
 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:27.210
scientist you don't belong here
that never happened to me I never had

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:27.220
that never happened to me I never had
 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:29.040
that never happened to me I never had
anybody say to my face in terms of a

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:29.050
anybody say to my face in terms of a
 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:30.720
anybody say to my face in terms of a
teacher you know you're not welcome here

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:30.730
teacher you know you're not welcome here
 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:31.829
teacher you know you're not welcome here
you don't belong here

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:31.839
you don't belong here
 

00:00:31.839 --> 00:00:34.440
you don't belong here
and in fact when I was in college some

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:34.450
and in fact when I was in college some
 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:36.360
and in fact when I was in college some
of the the highest performing students

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:36.370
of the the highest performing students
 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:38.850
of the the highest performing students
in my physics classes were women they

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:38.860
in my physics classes were women they
 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:40.440
in my physics classes were women they
were certainly in the minority in terms

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:40.450
were certainly in the minority in terms
 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:41.790
were certainly in the minority in terms
of numbers you know there were there

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:41.800
of numbers you know there were there
 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.260
of numbers you know there were there
were fewer of them in class compared to

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:43.270
were fewer of them in class compared to
 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:45.450
were fewer of them in class compared to
men but they were doing very well but

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:45.460
men but they were doing very well but
 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:46.980
men but they were doing very well but
one of the things that's most surprising

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:46.990
one of the things that's most surprising
 

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:48.210
one of the things that's most surprising
to me and I've talked to a lot of my

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:48.220
to me and I've talked to a lot of my
 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:50.340
to me and I've talked to a lot of my
women colleagues about this is that I

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:50.350
women colleagues about this is that I
 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:52.620
women colleagues about this is that I
really didn't expect some of the biggest

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:52.630
really didn't expect some of the biggest
 

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:56.070
really didn't expect some of the biggest
barriers to come from inside myself from

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:56.080
barriers to come from inside myself from
 

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:58.080
barriers to come from inside myself from
the very start of my scientific career

00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:58.090
the very start of my scientific career
 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:59.490
the very start of my scientific career
and I'm talking about undergraduate

00:00:59.490 --> 00:00:59.500
and I'm talking about undergraduate
 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:03.150
and I'm talking about undergraduate
being a physics major I grappled with

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:03.160
being a physics major I grappled with
 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.999
being a physics major I grappled with
almost crippling self-doubt it was

00:01:05.999 --> 00:01:06.009
almost crippling self-doubt it was
 

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:08.219
almost crippling self-doubt it was
really hard to get myself into the class

00:01:08.219 --> 00:01:08.229
really hard to get myself into the class
 

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:10.499
really hard to get myself into the class
I mean sometimes I actually had to work

00:01:10.499 --> 00:01:10.509
I mean sometimes I actually had to work
 

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:12.359
I mean sometimes I actually had to work
myself up into a character I'd sort of

00:01:12.359 --> 00:01:12.369
myself up into a character I'd sort of
 

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:14.130
myself up into a character I'd sort of
stand outside a classroom and think

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:14.140
stand outside a classroom and think
 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:16.080
stand outside a classroom and think
about how a physics student should feel

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:16.090
about how a physics student should feel
 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:17.399
about how a physics student should feel
or how they should behave

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:17.409
or how they should behave
 

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:20.310
or how they should behave
I felt very deeply that I didn't belong

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:20.320
I felt very deeply that I didn't belong
 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.200
I felt very deeply that I didn't belong
there but that was coming from me that

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:22.210
there but that was coming from me that
 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:23.639
there but that was coming from me that
didn't seem to be coming from anything

00:01:23.639 --> 00:01:23.649
didn't seem to be coming from anything
 

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:26.580
didn't seem to be coming from anything
external through most of my career in

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:26.590
external through most of my career in
 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:28.410
external through most of my career in
science and I'm talking about my

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:28.420
science and I'm talking about my
 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:31.169
science and I'm talking about my
education I was too scared to ask a

00:01:31.169 --> 00:01:31.179
education I was too scared to ask a
 

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:33.230
education I was too scared to ask a
single question I spent my entire

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240
single question I spent my entire
 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.459
single question I spent my entire
undergraduate and most of my graduate

00:01:35.459 --> 00:01:35.469
undergraduate and most of my graduate
 

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:37.380
undergraduate and most of my graduate
classes in the back of the class

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:37.390
classes in the back of the class
 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:40.230
classes in the back of the class
terrified I was copying the notes the

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:40.240
terrified I was copying the notes the
 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.239
terrified I was copying the notes the
teacher was was deriving something on

teacher was was deriving something on

teacher was was deriving something on
the blackboard I was copying it down but

00:01:44.309 --> 00:01:44.319
the blackboard I was copying it down but
 

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:45.599
the blackboard I was copying it down but
I mean it could have been in a foreign

00:01:45.599 --> 00:01:45.609
I mean it could have been in a foreign
 

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:48.120
I mean it could have been in a foreign
language I didn't understand it and I

language I didn't understand it and I
 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:50.190
language I didn't understand it and I
was so embarrassed to admit that I was

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:50.200
was so embarrassed to admit that I was
 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.399
was so embarrassed to admit that I was
that lost in that far behind I spent my

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:53.409
that lost in that far behind I spent my
 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:56.190
that lost in that far behind I spent my
entire scientific education being scared

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:56.200
entire scientific education being scared
 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:00.300
entire scientific education being scared
and I look back and I think why you know

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:00.310
and I look back and I think why you know
 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:02.279
and I look back and I think why you know
it turns out I now have a doctorate in

00:02:02.279 --> 00:02:02.289
it turns out I now have a doctorate in
 

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:04.889
it turns out I now have a doctorate in
physics I I can learn that I can do

00:02:04.889 --> 00:02:04.899
physics I I can learn that I can do
 

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:07.410
physics I I can learn that I can do
physics I can be successful at that I'm

physics I can be successful at that I'm
 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.670
physics I can be successful at that I'm
not an idiot so why was I so crippled

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680
not an idiot so why was I so crippled
 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.460
not an idiot so why was I so crippled
and held back by my own fear and by my

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:14.470
and held back by my own fear and by my
 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:15.330
and held back by my own fear and by my
own shame

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340
own shame
 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:17.250
own shame
at how I wasn't understanding this very

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260
at how I wasn't understanding this very
 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.460
at how I wasn't understanding this very
quickly I've heard people use the term

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.470
quickly I've heard people use the term
 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:23.220
quickly I've heard people use the term
impostor syndrome that for some reason

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230
impostor syndrome that for some reason
 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:24.870
impostor syndrome that for some reason
you're absolutely sure you don't belong

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880
you're absolutely sure you don't belong
 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.670
you're absolutely sure you don't belong
here and in fact you must have fooled

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680
here and in fact you must have fooled
 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.000
here and in fact you must have fooled
people into letting you be here I've had

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010
people into letting you be here I've had
 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:32.160
people into letting you be here I've had
it pointed out that if you can pass

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170
it pointed out that if you can pass
 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:34.259
it pointed out that if you can pass
comprehensive exams and physics which I

00:02:34.259 --> 00:02:34.269
comprehensive exams and physics which I
 

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:36.960
comprehensive exams and physics which I
have it probably means you belong here

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970
have it probably means you belong here
 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:38.490
have it probably means you belong here
probably means you learn the material

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500
probably means you learn the material
 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.250
probably means you learn the material
but it never felt that way it always

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260
but it never felt that way it always
 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.110
but it never felt that way it always
felt like maybe I had sort of pulled the

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120
felt like maybe I had sort of pulled the
 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.150
felt like maybe I had sort of pulled the
wool over people's eyes alright I you

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.160
wool over people's eyes alright I you
 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:46.949
wool over people's eyes alright I you
know I shouldn't be here and I've fooled

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:46.959
know I shouldn't be here and I've fooled
 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:48.780
know I shouldn't be here and I've fooled
people into thinking I belong here and

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790
people into thinking I belong here and
 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:51.240
people into thinking I belong here and
there's this sense of shame and I'm

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250
there's this sense of shame and I'm
 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:53.430
there's this sense of shame and I'm
gonna admit this to you I still feel

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440
gonna admit this to you I still feel
 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.759
gonna admit this to you I still feel
that today I feel that every single day

00:02:56.759 --> 00:02:56.769
that today I feel that every single day
 

00:02:56.769 --> 00:02:58.680
that today I feel that every single day
I go to NASA and I'm with these

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:58.690
I go to NASA and I'm with these
 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:01.229
I go to NASA and I'm with these
brilliant people all around me every

00:03:01.229 --> 00:03:01.239
brilliant people all around me every
 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:03.030
brilliant people all around me every
single day I still feel like I don't

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040
single day I still feel like I don't
 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:04.860
single day I still feel like I don't
belong and it's been some kind of a

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:04.870
belong and it's been some kind of a
 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:08.250
belong and it's been some kind of a
mistake that they let me in imagine your

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260
mistake that they let me in imagine your
 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.070
mistake that they let me in imagine your
whole career being like that never

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:11.080
whole career being like that never
 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:13.020
whole career being like that never
feeling like you belong and I'm not

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.030
feeling like you belong and I'm not
 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.890
feeling like you belong and I'm not
saying this is something that only

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900
saying this is something that only
 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:15.660
saying this is something that only
happens to women I'm sure this happens

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:15.670
happens to women I'm sure this happens
 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:17.640
happens to women I'm sure this happens
to men too but I've had to ask myself

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650
to men too but I've had to ask myself
 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.630
