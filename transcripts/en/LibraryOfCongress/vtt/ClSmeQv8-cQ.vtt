&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:24.580
&gt;&gt; Brian Ausland: Okay,
welcome to session

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:26.470
on Digital Collections
K-12 Classroom;

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:28.690
Connecting with Teachers
and Students.

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:33.190
It's a co-presentation by our
three respective projects.

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:37.410
Go ahead and do a quick
introduction.

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.390
&gt;&gt; Franky Abbott: I'm Franky Abbott
of the Digital Public Library

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:45.240
of America, and I am the Curation
and Education Strategist at DPLA,

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:49.910
and I have worked on our
Primary Source Sets Project.

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:51.270
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Greenhut:
And I'm Stephanie Greenhut

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.510
from the National Archives.

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:57.850 position:56%
I'm an Education Technology
Specialist there and Project Manager

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:02.110
of the DocsTeach.org
project that we have.

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:03.410
&gt;&gt; Brian Ausland: And
I'm Brian Ausland.

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:07.820 position:56%
I'm with Navigation North out of
California, and we did the research,

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:09.120
development, and design

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:11.470
of Smithsonian's new
Learning Lab system.

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:18.100
Okay, so we have a plan
for this presentation.

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:22.970
We got the first bullet done, we're
going to take a high-level response

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:26.910
to the five questions that we
put in our session description.

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:29.380
As a team, we've met
a few times and talked

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:30.680
about those questions respectively

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:32.550
to our own experience
and background.

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:34.300
So it's going to be kind
of a high-level thing,

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:35.680
and then we're going to take
time for questions to get

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:40.630
into more detailed information
you based on that it is

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:43.990
that deem important
or need to know about,

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:51.980
but Robert Burns said
something about plans.

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:57.420
Part of our plan is
this macro approach,

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.210
and then the questions let us
get into some more details,

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.410 position:56%
and the reason for that is the
morals we met and talked about this.

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:06.480
The three of us are really not
talking about our own experience,

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:08.380
we're talking about the
experience of our projects.

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:12.420
These can all easily be their
own sessions, and so we're going

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.610 position:56%
to do our best to kind of just fly
across the top of these bigger ideas

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:18.240 position:56%
and then go where you need us to go.

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.690
So you're part of that plan.

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:25.890
So if you can help us
with in that last part

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.360
to let us know what you need to
know more about, and we've come

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.320
to the conclusion that if you
walk out of the room kind of clear

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:36.310 position:56%
about what our projects respectively
tackled and try to understand and do

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:39.310
and what they continue to grow
and want to do, and if you find

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:41.760
that valuable or of use or
of need for some of the work

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.710
that you're looking at,
then really, the best thing

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:46.600
that could happen is you would
develop a relationship with one

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:50.060
of us are all of us and we can
extend the conversation beyond this

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:52.910
presentation to help you or
give you whatever we know

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:54.960
and whatever we've learned
through the process.

00:02:54.960 --> 00:03:00.920
So we're going to start with just
a description about our projects,

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.150
very briefly, that we
are all involved with,

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:04.750
and we'll start with Franky.

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:08.060
&gt;&gt; Franky Abbott: Sure, so you
heard a little bit this morning

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:10.910
about the Prime Resource
Sets Project.

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:13.590
DPLA, as you know,
is a big aggregator.

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:17.210
We work with 1900 institutions
and 14 million items

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:21.180
from those institutions, and part
of the mission of DPLA is to get

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.830
that content used, and
education audiences want

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:26.240
to be possible audiences
that might use

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:28.600 position:56%
of cultural heritage content online.

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:33.090
So we did a research year in 2014
to 2015, and then we organized

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:34.570
in education advisory committee

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:36.230
of which we have a
member in the audience.

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:42.160
Hi, Ella. Which is a group of 10
educators in grades 6 through 14.

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:43.460
They met with us.

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:46.160
They helped us design a
template for primary source sets

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:49.410
and then they helped us develop
a collection of 100 of them.

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:52.700
The last group of which just went
up on Monday, which is exciting.

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:58.610
Primary Source Sets at the DPLA are
pretty simple and I think reusable

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:00.160
for teachers in a variety of ways.

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:02.000
They are an overview.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.290 position:56%
Ten to 15 selected and curated items

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:07.440
from the DLA's partners'
collections,

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:10.240
and then a teaching guide
with inquiry-based questions

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:12.690 position:56%
and activities that teachers can use

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:16.270
to employ the primary
sources in the classroom.

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:19.950
They're organized around topics in
US history, literature and culture,

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:22.710
although we've made some very
brief forays into world history

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:25.290
and our most recent round.

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:26.590
They are up online.

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:28.050 position:56%
You can see the URL, and our project

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:31.840 position:56%
of these three tackles some
similar issues in that it is working

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:36.390
with a specific group of
digital content that is online,

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:38.290
in this case, for multiple
institutions,

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:41.840
but it is by far the youngest
education effort on this panel.

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:45.030
So we have benefited a lot
from speaking with Stephanie

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:48.510
and also Brian's team of
folks at the Smithsonian.

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:51.400
So thanks for being
on our panel with me.

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:54.430
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Greenhut: All right,

00:04:54.430 --> 00:05:00.240
and just to tell you a
little bit about DocsTeach.

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:04.310
DocsTeach is, we call the online
tool for teaching with documents

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:05.910
from the national archives.

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:09.500
As opposed to the DPLA
Primary Source Sets,

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:13.450
this site is kind of
a dinosaur actually.

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:16.790 position:56%
We're in the midst of overhauling
it right now to be a little fresher,

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:19.240
but it's actually going to
be six years old next month,

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:23.910
which is pretty old for an
attractive website like this.

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:28.760
You can kind of get a hint
at the main components here.

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:31.600
It's really made up of
activities and documents,

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:34.390
and as you can imagine, the
documents here are coming

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:37.060
from the holdings of
the national archives.

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:39.490
You've probably heard little bit
about the National Archives today,

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:41.730
but we're an independent agency.

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:45.810
We have billions of records from
all three branches of government.

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:49.610
One of the things that we
try and do for DocsTeach,

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:55.240
which is a site geared at teachers
to be able to use for, you know,

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:59.120
to come up with teaching
materials for their students.

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:06.090 position:56%
We don't take all of the digitized
records that we have in the holdings

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:07.550
of the National Archives.

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:11.250
Our online catalog has thousands
and thousands and thousands more,

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:13.770
but what we're trying to
do is really pick the ones

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:18.900
that we think would be useful tools
for the classroom, and so we sort

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:21.500
of curate the set in a way.

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:25.350
It also would tend to be most
useful and a history classroom,

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:27.970
but there certainly are some
materials that could cross

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:33.090
over to world history, to language
arts, even foreign language.

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:35.510
We do have some records
that fit there.

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:40.390
We have, on the other side
of things, the activities.

00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:42.640
It's kind of a tool
wok tour teachers.

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:49.710
I always use -- describe it sort of
like food or cooking, if you will.

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:54.760
We have these activities on the
site where if you are a teacher,

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:58.490
and you know, just like now,
you're on your way home after work,

00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:02.020
and you don't feel like
putting together a dinner.

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:04.900
You stop, you pick up take
out or something pre-made

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:06.620
and it's ready to go,
just like that.

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:08.810
You can come, find activities
that are ready to use,

00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:11.170
use them in your classroom with
your students, but sometimes,

00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:13.210
you go the semi-homemade route.

00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:16.940
So, you might, you know,
make some mac &amp; cheese

00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:18.240
and slip some broccoli in there.

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:19.540
Excuse me, I have a toddler.

00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:25.030
So I'm always slipping in
things like that, but, you know,

00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:27.320
so what you can do on this
side as a teacher, if you come,

00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:29.480
you can find an activity
that you like,

00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:31.270
but then you can modify
it to fit your needs.

00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:33.680
So you might change the primary
sources that are involved,

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:34.980
swap out the instructions.

00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:36.280
That kind of thing.

00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:40.640
Or you can go from scratch and
use one of the tools that we have

00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:43.330
on the site to make
your own entirely

00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:45.260
from scratch new online activities,

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:49.840
and while the activities
have their own unique URL

00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:52.740
that students can do online or
teachers can project it to use

00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:55.840
in the classroom, that
kind of thing.

00:07:55.840 --> 00:08:00.210
So we've got the online sites, and
then we developed an app, as well,

00:08:00.210 --> 00:08:04.260
that students can actually
use to do the activities

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:07.260
that their teachers have either
found or created for them.

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:09.920
So that's DocsTeach in a nutshell.

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:11.220
Brian.

00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:14.020
&gt;&gt; Brian Ausland: I didn't advance.

00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:15.320
I didn't --

00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:16.620
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Greenhut:
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:17.920
I totally forgot.

00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:19.220
&gt;&gt; Brian Ausland: Because
if you could explain this.

00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:20.520
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Greenhut: Sure,
yeah, sorry about that.

00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:21.820
&gt;&gt; Brian Ausland: I've got.

00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:23.120
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Greenhut:
Here we click.

00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:26.250
Yeah, so totally forgot to -- but
one of the things I wanted to point

00:08:26.250 --> 00:08:33.170
out is we tried to put some of the
control into the teachers' hands.

00:08:33.170 --> 00:08:35.430
We really wanted to create a
tool that teachers could use.

00:08:35.430 --> 00:08:40.700
So here you can see sort of the
back end of teachers are able

00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:45.460 position:56%
to use these tools or templates that
we have pretty easily and quickly

00:08:45.460 --> 00:08:55.430
to pull together activities that
can really end up varying a lot.

00:08:55.430 --> 00:08:57.890
&gt;&gt; Brian Ausland: I like how
she describes her project

00:08:57.890 --> 00:09:00.200
as old, or what it's --

00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:01.500
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Greenhut: Dinosaur.

00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:02.800
&gt;&gt; Brian Ausland: A dinosaur.

00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:05.150
We actually value their project,
because we started working

00:09:05.150 --> 00:09:08.020
with the Smithsonian on the
research, we were looking at --

00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:11.590 position:56%
the Smithsonian had a long history
of developing, internally developing

00:09:11.590 --> 00:09:16.500
through central efforts with their
educator teams' curriculum bundles

00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:21.750
and curriculum models for teachers
to use, and they asked us to look

00:09:21.750 --> 00:09:23.130
and do an environmental scan

00:09:23.130 --> 00:09:26.440
of digital resource
learning object sites

00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:31.320
that weren't packaging the
curriculum as kind of locked

00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:34.880
up ready to go curriculum but, in
fact, was allowing practitioners

00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:38.680
in the field to do manipulations of
the curriculum, and at that time,

00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:41.640
five years ago, we only
found three examples

00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:44.030
that had any real traction
nationally,

00:09:44.030 --> 00:09:48.310
and the primary example we
found was the DocsTeach site,

00:09:48.310 --> 00:09:50.120
and so we approached Stephanie
and her team at that time.

00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:52.210
We said, "Whose crazy
idea was this?"

00:09:52.210 --> 00:09:54.780 position:56%
You know, because there wasn't a lot
of research to support at the time.

00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:57.240
So we knew they had done a
lot of that type of work.

00:09:57.240 --> 00:10:01.260
So we just want to know like it's
a pretty bold move in this space.

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:04.200
So I really like to acknowledge
their work in this field,

00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:07.040
because a lot of us have
built upon it since then.

00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:12.470
Of course, with the Smithsonian
we also had, and we have --

00:10:12.470 --> 00:10:14.330
is there Smithsonian
folks in the room today?

00:10:14.330 --> 00:10:16.280
I saw Sarah's here.

00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:18.000
Anyone else?

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:19.560
Okay, so Sarah, don't
share everything I say.

00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:21.330
I'm not a Smithsonian person.

00:10:21.330 --> 00:10:22.820
So I was a person who came
in and worked with them

00:10:22.820 --> 00:10:26.360 position:56%
that they contracted to come and
help them think through this process

00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:29.730
and perform research
and look at data,

00:10:29.730 --> 00:10:35.310
but I was impressed upon just the
sheer size of the bureaucracy,

00:10:35.310 --> 00:10:39.200
and the deepness and the
long-standing cultures of control,

00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:43.350 position:56%
and really, that became, and they're
like, "So our real work is to figure

00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:45.410
out what teachers want, and
we really quickly learned

00:10:45.410 --> 00:10:46.710
that that wasn't the real work.

00:10:46.710 --> 00:10:48.930
The real work was addressing
cultural shifts

00:10:48.930 --> 00:10:51.650
that would be required to do
something similar to DocsTeach.

00:10:51.650 --> 00:10:56.590
So just a schematic that we
developed for them at the time,

00:10:56.590 --> 00:11:00.700
19 museums, nine research centers,
one national zoo, lots of stuff,

00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:05.080 position:56%
lots of people, lots of history,
lots of ego, lots of stuff going on,

00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:11.000 position:56%
all corridors, and so we simply came
in, and we looked at this one piece

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.080
of data which drove their work
in the beginning was they said,

00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:19.450 position:56%
well 1995 to 2014, they had a
13.16% increase in physical visitors

00:11:19.450 --> 00:11:22.900
to their, any one of their places,

00:11:22.900 --> 00:11:27.740
and they had 135,000 plus percent
increase in their digital visits.

00:11:27.740 --> 00:11:30.030
So they're, like, well,
what are we doing with that?

00:11:30.030 --> 00:11:32.850
They also received is in funding
to investigate this through Gates

00:11:32.850 --> 00:11:35.290
at the time, which said,
we want you to do more

00:11:35.290 --> 00:11:40.320
to make the Smithsonian's assets
more accessible to citizens

00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:44.910
that are geographically remote from
the Smithsonian physically and are

00:11:44.910 --> 00:11:47.470
from certain demographics and
populations within communities

00:11:47.470 --> 00:11:50.770
that will most likely never come to
the Smithsonian in their lifetime.

00:11:50.770 --> 00:11:52.070
So they were looking
at some of that data.

00:11:52.070 --> 00:11:54.610 position:56%
So they said, "Well, we need to make
better use of our web presence,"

00:11:54.610 --> 00:11:58.780
and so one of their approaches,
which was the sliver of the project

00:11:58.780 --> 00:12:03.960
that moved our way was they'll make
it really consumable and desirable

00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:06.560
for teachers to use, and they'll
take it to kids in classrooms,

00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:08.690
and that will be one way
to expose the Smithsonian

00:12:08.690 --> 00:12:13.400
to a large group of
future US citizens.

00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:15.830
They had this piece of
research which drove some

00:12:15.830 --> 00:12:19.540 position:56%
of their early efforts, and that
was they had done this investigation

00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:21.500
piece for over two
years, and they saw

00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:23.660
that teachers were
readily disassembling all

00:12:23.660 --> 00:12:25.070
of their beautiful
curriculum, right?

00:12:25.070 --> 00:12:29.480
So teachers would take all of this
valuable, structured, thoughtful,

00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:32.760
methodically designed curriculum
and just pull it all apart.

00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:35.380
Like, at the third grade
level in classes in Ohio,

00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:41.070
in afterschool programs in Oregon,
and they said, "That's disturbing."

00:12:41.070 --> 00:12:46.050
And then the teachers and the
data that we did as follow-up,

00:12:46.050 --> 00:12:49.110
because we were monitoring this
through use data across a number

00:12:49.110 --> 00:12:52.450
of different state platforms
at the time, the data showed

00:12:52.450 --> 00:12:55.040
that not only were teachers taking
it apart, which they are saying,

00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:56.340
"Well, we can deal with it.

00:12:56.340 --> 00:12:57.640
We'll figure out how
to deal with that."

00:12:57.640 --> 00:12:59.450
The problem was that the
teachers valued the content,

00:12:59.450 --> 00:13:02.340
the Smithsonian content, as highly
and instructionally valuable,

00:13:02.340 --> 00:13:03.730
was their first assertion,

00:13:03.730 --> 00:13:06.260
the single most important
data point teachers gave us.

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:07.920
They found the value in
the instruction materials.

00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:10.440
They didn't promptly disassemble
those instruction materials,

00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:12.310
which they found valuable,
because they said, "Well,

00:13:12.310 --> 00:13:13.610
we want to add more value to it."

00:13:13.610 --> 00:13:15.920
So they always knew that
they could improve it.

00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:18.300
The third thing was more disturbing
to them, and that's what we showed,

00:13:18.300 --> 00:13:20.900
is that most of those
teachers who found value

00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:25.140 position:56%
in the instructional content and had
to do work without tools but do work

00:13:25.140 --> 00:13:28.140
to like crop a picture
out of one of their sites

00:13:28.140 --> 00:13:32.000
or take a paragraph information,
put it into a Word document,

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.100
rewrite it in a way that was more
accessible to their students,

00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:37.010
it was so cumbersome to them

00:13:37.010 --> 00:13:39.680
that they stopped using
the materials at all.

00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:41.350
So we'd show this incredible
drop-off

00:13:41.350 --> 00:13:43.850
where they'd come to
the systems once.

00:13:43.850 --> 00:13:45.730 position:56%
They had a 5-plus minute engagement,

00:13:45.730 --> 00:13:49.750 position:56%
and we could see what they were
doing with the system and record it,

00:13:49.750 --> 00:13:52.060
and so to them what was
most disturbing was not

00:13:52.060 --> 00:13:53.680
that they were modifying the
curriculum was that they found it

00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:55.260
so cumbersome that they just
didn't come use it at all,

00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:56.560 position:56%
even when they assigned value to it.

00:13:56.560 --> 00:14:02.000
So that was one of their
more significant findings.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:06.610
We did some work from there, and
really, our work was done directly

00:14:06.610 --> 00:14:07.910
with large groups of teachers.

00:14:07.910 --> 00:14:12.570
We did three years of research with
teacher teams from all over the US.

00:14:12.570 --> 00:14:16.200
We had the teachers of the
year from every single state

00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:18.880
that we had access to for the
weeks that they were here in DC

00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:22.350
for the teacher of the year,
trip to the White House,

00:14:22.350 --> 00:14:26.090
etc. Pearson would pay to have
them out here a week in advance.

00:14:26.090 --> 00:14:28.090
The Smithsonian would get to
work with them for certain hours

00:14:28.090 --> 00:14:29.390
of the day throughout those weeks.

00:14:29.390 --> 00:14:31.290
So we used that time
to test teachers.

00:14:31.290 --> 00:14:33.380
That's one of the pictures
that's up there.

00:14:33.380 --> 00:14:35.040
We worked with teachers
through that process.

00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:38.770
We then created a field group
of teachers across the US

00:14:38.770 --> 00:14:42.370
that had a more diverse
blue-collar approach to teachers.

00:14:42.370 --> 00:14:44.560
Not the teachers of the
year from every state,

00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:48.000
and from diverse communities,
and then our second line

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.590
of research was we distilled
that down to 25 teachers

00:14:51.590 --> 00:14:53.750
who then gave us access
to their classrooms,

00:14:53.750 --> 00:14:57.110
and from the teachers results,
which were paper-based prototypes

00:14:57.110 --> 00:14:59.320
that then turned into technical
prototypes, which then turned

00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:02.200
into web-based prototypes, we
actually took the prototypes

00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:05.360
into the classrooms of these
teachers, where the teachers,

00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:09.550
much to our amazement
and horror, said,

00:15:09.550 --> 00:15:12.270
"You work with our kids
with your prototype."

00:15:12.270 --> 00:15:16.390
And so we then would spend two
to four days, two hours a day,

00:15:16.390 --> 00:15:18.760
performing projects and activities,
as designed by the teachers

00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:21.590
with our prototype, and the teacher
said, "You should co-teach this

00:15:21.590 --> 00:15:24.320
with us, and then you might
understand where it works

00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:26.470
and doesn't work for the kids."

00:15:26.470 --> 00:15:32.480
Which was very scary for lots of
people on my side of the team.

00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:35.860
But what we ended up developing was
a system of tools that are shown

00:15:35.860 --> 00:15:39.670
where teachers could manipulate
resources, annotate resources,

00:15:39.670 --> 00:15:44.150
resequence them, put in
formative assessment pieces.

00:15:44.150 --> 00:15:48.000
Students could do different
things with a high-level imagery,

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.940
mix-and-match content resources.

00:15:50.940 --> 00:15:53.590
Teachers could roll assignments
out through the system,

00:15:53.590 --> 00:15:56.550
and it could track that, and we
took a very low-threshold approach

00:15:56.550 --> 00:15:59.790
that we can have the teachers
do the basic steps they do

00:15:59.790 --> 00:16:02.440
when developing curriculum and
engaging students in formative

00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:05.940
and summative activities, but
then we had to make it so that all

00:16:05.940 --> 00:16:08.830
of these things, as beautiful as
the system was, and as eloquent

00:16:08.830 --> 00:16:12.030
as the design teams
took effort to make it,

00:16:12.030 --> 00:16:16.460
that all of this could be ported
out to things like EdModo or Canvas

00:16:16.460 --> 00:16:18.680
by in structure or whatever
they're using locally,

00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:20.500
since that's what they
are invested in using.

00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:24.700
So that was the approach, and
that with our brief covering

00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:28.820
of three-and-half years of
research and development.

00:16:28.820 --> 00:16:32.670
&gt;&gt; Franky Abbott: Sure, so we would
go through the questions briefly

00:16:32.670 --> 00:16:35.200
as a group that we promised
to address in this session.

00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:38.480
Some of them, one of us are
going to take a little stab at,

00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:39.950
and then others we're
going to answer

00:16:39.950 --> 00:16:42.280
in a little bit more
of a group kind of way.

00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:48.370
So I'm going to take question
number one, which is -- oh, yes?

00:16:48.370 --> 00:16:49.840
&gt;&gt; Okay, okay.

00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:52.470
&gt;&gt; Franky Abbott: Okay,
question number one.

00:16:52.470 --> 00:16:58.930
What is the value of education
work for cultural institutions?

00:16:58.930 --> 00:17:03.300
I feel like I'm in a pretty good
position to answer this question,

00:17:03.300 --> 00:17:06.560
because DPLA is, of course, the
owner of none of its own content,

00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:09.920
but we do work with lots of other
institutions, and so I do interact

00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:12.630
with people from multiple
institutional contexts

00:17:12.630 --> 00:17:16.070
to create the primary source
sets, and I think for all of us,

00:17:16.070 --> 00:17:19.330
I think it's safe to say
that the big, exciting thing

00:17:19.330 --> 00:17:21.430
about education work is use, right?

00:17:21.430 --> 00:17:24.070
And education use, which
is a particular kind of use

00:17:24.070 --> 00:17:25.830
in the world of copyright.

00:17:25.830 --> 00:17:28.230
People are generally a
little bit more generous,

00:17:28.230 --> 00:17:30.360
a little more enthusiastic
to connect their materials

00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:33.860
with the education
audience, and also, often,

00:17:33.860 --> 00:17:37.270
education work is a core part of
a cultural institution's mission.

00:17:37.270 --> 00:17:40.440
So the idea of connecting with
teachers and students is a piece

00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:45.630
of that, and finally, sometimes
the idea or the promise

00:17:45.630 --> 00:17:47.680
of education use has, in
fact, been a rationale

00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:49.420 position:56%
for funding the digitization itself.

00:17:49.420 --> 00:17:53.000
So the idea that when this
stuff, which is such great stuff,

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:55.720
is online that it will become
useful for classrooms, you know,

00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:59.010
in the state or across the country,
is kind the part of the reason

00:17:59.010 --> 00:18:01.780
that people embark on digitization
projects in the first place.

00:18:01.780 --> 00:18:03.950
That's not the only reason,
but it's a valuable reason,

00:18:03.950 --> 00:18:07.590
and so I think it's safe to
say, from a use perspective,

00:18:07.590 --> 00:18:09.790
there's actually a tremendous
amount in education work

00:18:09.790 --> 00:18:13.700
for cultural institutions, but it
presents a series of big challenges

00:18:13.700 --> 00:18:17.010 position:56%
which we'll talk about in the
answers to these questions, as well.

00:18:17.010 --> 00:18:19.040
It's your turn.

00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:25.000
&gt;&gt; Brian Ausland: I
took question two,

00:18:26.980 --> 00:18:32.260
and please appreciate the amount
of time we spent researching this.

00:18:32.260 --> 00:18:34.370
Question is, "What is the value
of this content to teachers

00:18:34.370 --> 00:18:36.080
and students, and how
do they use it?"

00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:38.110
That's kind of a big,
loaded question.

00:18:38.110 --> 00:18:41.270
So bear with me on this slide.

00:18:41.270 --> 00:18:44.600
We published three separate
folios of research on this topic,

00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:49.210
which all can be found online
and it's really exciting reading.

00:18:49.210 --> 00:18:51.850
I urge you to take an
opportunity to nose through it.

00:18:51.850 --> 00:18:54.930
However, here's a distillation
of what we were looking at.

00:18:54.930 --> 00:18:59.890
Some of the Pew studies
was our first column

00:18:59.890 --> 00:19:05.450
of information that's Internet has
a major impact on 90% of teachers'

00:19:05.450 --> 00:19:08.260
to access content resource
materials for their teaching.

00:19:08.260 --> 00:19:09.890
90% of teachers are
using search engines

00:19:09.890 --> 00:19:11.450
to find information
on a daily basis.

00:19:11.450 --> 00:19:15.000
84% use the Internet weekly to find
content that'll engage students.

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:18.590
80% were using Internet weekly
to help them create lesson plans,

00:19:18.590 --> 00:19:23.190
and this a Pew study from 2013.

00:19:23.190 --> 00:19:27.720
So it's only gone up from there
when we did the original work

00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:31.910
with this a year into our project.

00:19:31.910 --> 00:19:38.600
Our findings were that
teachers needed the content

00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:39.900
as delivered in these ways.

00:19:39.900 --> 00:19:42.110
This type of OER with
tools that allowed them

00:19:42.110 --> 00:19:45.050
to manage how it's
structured and delivered

00:19:45.050 --> 00:19:47.200
to students to be flexible.

00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:52.310 position:56%
They valued that they could maximize
the use of high-quality images.

00:19:52.310 --> 00:19:56.390 position:56%
They wanted variable manipulations
with those images that weren't built

00:19:56.390 --> 00:19:59.420
in at the time and that weren't
being released digitally for fear

00:19:59.420 --> 00:20:02.280
of printing and copyright
infringement.

00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:06.410
So we had to overcome
some of those hurdles,

00:20:06.410 --> 00:20:10.350
particularly with the
National Portrait Gallery.

00:20:10.350 --> 00:20:15.480
Tools suggested to help adapt
resources to diverse learners.

00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:16.950
They appreciated that
they could diversify

00:20:16.950 --> 00:20:19.450
for different learner types in
their classrooms, which typically,

00:20:19.450 --> 00:20:22.940
a single set of curriculum couldn't
do or couldn't know how to do,

00:20:22.940 --> 00:20:25.140
for a given teacher's kids.

00:20:25.140 --> 00:20:29.160
They wanted to dedicate a space for
collecting and saving resources.

00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:32.730
Some of the outcomes they were
looking for that started to get

00:20:32.730 --> 00:20:35.220
to us that started to be more

00:20:35.220 --> 00:20:39.080
about pedagogy involved
making content more inclusive,

00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:43.370
increasing learner
engagement, localizing

00:20:43.370 --> 00:20:45.340
and personalizing content
to their area.

00:20:45.340 --> 00:20:49.890
An example we had were the teachers
in, particularly California,

00:20:49.890 --> 00:20:52.510
but particularly in Northern
California that do a real emphasis

00:20:52.510 --> 00:20:55.060
on Gold Rush, which they are not
going to see with a curriculum

00:20:55.060 --> 00:20:56.440
that comes from outside
of that area to the degree

00:20:56.440 --> 00:21:00.340
that they do that work there.

00:21:00.340 --> 00:21:03.250
Modification to support
specific learner needs.

00:21:03.250 --> 00:21:05.660
Diverse content types and sources,

00:21:05.660 --> 00:21:07.720
which they typically don't have
access to, which could come

00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:09.600
through vehicles like this.

00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:13.260
Differentiate formative
and summative materials,

00:21:13.260 --> 00:21:15.720
particularly the formative pieces.

00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:18.110
They were more interested
in delivering

00:21:18.110 --> 00:21:24.730
and creating contemporary content
that was up-to-date, timely,

00:21:24.730 --> 00:21:27.340
something that typically
doesn't get delivered to them

00:21:27.340 --> 00:21:32.010
in their traditional sources
of instructional information

00:21:32.010 --> 00:21:35.660
and materials and resources,
and support non-trad

00:21:35.660 --> 00:21:40.950
and emerging pedagogies, which
is, as Lisa's team pointed

00:21:40.950 --> 00:21:42.990
out this morning, there's a
real shift going on in K-12

00:21:42.990 --> 00:21:46.670
with that textbooks aren't
prepared to or structured

00:21:46.670 --> 00:21:51.290
to support cross-disciplinary
instruction, STEM-based focus,

00:21:51.290 --> 00:21:53.760
all the way down into the
lower elementary levels.

00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:56.670
So they need some flexibility
to respond

00:21:56.670 --> 00:22:00.490 position:56%
to those new pedagogical shifts that
they're seeing and they're liking

00:22:00.490 --> 00:22:02.040
and wanting to take
up on behalf of kids.

00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:08.120
So some of the other things that we
had to point out was that the value

00:22:08.120 --> 00:22:10.600
of the content for
the teachers was in --

00:22:10.600 --> 00:22:12.680
some of it was just in
the digital delivery.

00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:16.050
So the teachers are having to
have kids take high-stakes,

00:22:16.050 --> 00:22:18.350
summative assessments in digital
environments, by and large,

00:22:18.350 --> 00:22:21.610
and almost every state now,
moving off of paper and pencil,

00:22:21.610 --> 00:22:23.110
and just the fact that
they could move kids

00:22:23.110 --> 00:22:27.180 position:56%
through some digital environments
and iterations of analyzing research

00:22:27.180 --> 00:22:31.220 position:56%
and content, responded to questions,
working collaboratively online,

00:22:31.220 --> 00:22:33.800
is helping kids be more
prepared for when those types

00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:36.250
of high-summative level events
happen later in the school year.

00:22:36.250 --> 00:22:40.300
So that was an asset to
teachers that they could do that,

00:22:40.300 --> 00:22:42.480
and they also said
that the students tend

00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:45.320
to be just a little more
engaged in the use of technology

00:22:45.320 --> 00:22:47.310
in their classrooms, and
it was giving teachers kind

00:22:47.310 --> 00:22:53.890
of a guided vehicle to
use that in that way.

00:22:53.890 --> 00:22:55.240
&gt;&gt; Franky Abbott: This
slide has less text on it

00:22:55.240 --> 00:22:56.540
than the slide before it.

00:22:56.540 --> 00:22:57.860
Question three, we're
going to answer

00:22:57.860 --> 00:23:00.870
in a little bit more of a group.

00:23:00.870 --> 00:23:02.580
"What are the most
important considerations

00:23:02.580 --> 00:23:04.010
when designing for this audience?"

00:23:04.010 --> 00:23:09.200 position:56%
This is another really big question,
but two contributions from me

00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:12.150
and from our experience on
the Primary Source Sets.

00:23:12.150 --> 00:23:16.500
Number one, there is a disconnect
between the folks who organize

00:23:16.500 --> 00:23:19.600 position:56%
and describe digital collections and
the teachers who want to use them,

00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:21.970
and some of that disconnect
appears in the way

00:23:21.970 --> 00:23:24.540
that objects are described
in digital collections.

00:23:24.540 --> 00:23:27.580
So the way that metadata, which
is, in the best case scenario,

00:23:27.580 --> 00:23:32.960
pretty comprehensive, appears and
is useful to any and a variety

00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:36.510 position:56%
of audiences in the general public
is sometimes an information overload

00:23:36.510 --> 00:23:38.550
and requires a little
bit of translation

00:23:38.550 --> 00:23:40.480
and sometimes some
additional contextualization

00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:42.490
to make an object useful
for the classroom.

00:23:42.490 --> 00:23:48.720
So I think one of the biggest
roles that we play on our teams is

00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:51.400
that with the assistance of lots
of other people and teachers is

00:23:51.400 --> 00:23:56.070
that role of translator between
how an object is being described

00:23:56.070 --> 00:23:57.580
and how it arrives
in the collection,

00:23:57.580 --> 00:24:00.270
and how it might be slightly
differently described

00:24:00.270 --> 00:24:03.390
and contextualized to put
it in an education resource.

00:24:03.390 --> 00:24:07.140
So considering the kinds of
translation that would be required

00:24:07.140 --> 00:24:08.770
of your digital collection
items, which again,

00:24:08.770 --> 00:24:10.370
are not necessarily
inherently useful.

00:24:10.370 --> 00:24:14.160
They are made useful by
education curation I would say,

00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:17.880
and the second is probably pretty
obvious, that it's important to us

00:24:17.880 --> 00:24:22.410
on this stage, but if you are
considering designing an education

00:24:22.410 --> 00:24:24.240
resource project from
a digital collection,

00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:27.330
you have to engage teachers
in your project in real ways.

00:24:27.330 --> 00:24:29.950
So they need to be part
of a research process

00:24:29.950 --> 00:24:34.260
for the design process it
itself or the curation process.

00:24:34.260 --> 00:24:36.640
I think it's pretty rare

00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:38.970
that cultural institutions
have a huge number of people

00:24:38.970 --> 00:24:41.200
with an education background on
their staff, and if you have that,

00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:46.210
that's terrific, but if not, there
are creative ways to incentivize,

00:24:46.210 --> 00:24:49.880
employ, or otherwise engage
teachers in the process of thinking

00:24:49.880 --> 00:24:51.620
through your education
project and executing it.

00:24:51.620 --> 00:24:53.790
So that's a really
big consideration.

00:24:53.790 --> 00:24:57.290
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Greenhut:
I'm really going

00:24:57.290 --> 00:24:59.190
to piggyback on both
of those points.

00:24:59.190 --> 00:25:04.670
I think Franky's first point
about there's this kind of idea

00:25:04.670 --> 00:25:08.440
of translation is really
important and something

00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:11.900
that we have seen a lot,
especially, you know,

00:25:11.900 --> 00:25:15.220
even if it's just hiding
some of the metadata

00:25:15.220 --> 00:25:18.300
that can be a bit overwhelming
to both teachers

00:25:18.300 --> 00:25:23.750 position:56%
and students, and providing context.

00:25:23.750 --> 00:25:27.600
You know, we have definitely always
seen that the more that we are able

00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:30.940
to do that, the more uptake
there is of any given resource.

00:25:30.940 --> 00:25:34.480
I think that the second point

00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:38.270
about engaging teachers is really
important too because there's a lot

00:25:38.270 --> 00:25:43.080
of complexities when it comes to
the, you know, teacher population,

00:25:43.080 --> 00:25:48.460
that are worth understanding
or trying to understand

00:25:48.460 --> 00:25:52.530
or acknowledging when you're
creating education resources, and,

00:25:52.530 --> 00:25:55.420
you know, I actually came from
the National Archives straight

00:25:55.420 --> 00:25:57.190
from the classroom.

00:25:57.190 --> 00:25:59.980
I was teaching seventh
grade and then came on board

00:25:59.980 --> 00:26:02.990
at the National Archives, and I
can remember thinking when I left

00:26:02.990 --> 00:26:06.520
that job, "I need to remember
that if I email these people

00:26:06.520 --> 00:26:08.690
and they don't email me back,
not to take it personally,

00:26:08.690 --> 00:26:12.980
because they have no time
to do it," and you know,

00:26:12.980 --> 00:26:16.560
I've been out of the
classroom now eight years,

00:26:16.560 --> 00:26:19.590
and I'm kind of starting
to forget a little bit.

00:26:19.590 --> 00:26:22.540
So I do think it's
really important to bring

00:26:22.540 --> 00:26:24.850
in that perspective,
that fresh perspective.

00:26:24.850 --> 00:26:26.980
But, you know, but I
think that translates

00:26:26.980 --> 00:26:29.830
into what you're designing for
teachers too, because, you know,

00:26:29.830 --> 00:26:34.640
going back to the metadata,
teachers don't have time to weed

00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:37.410
through a lot to get
at what they want,

00:26:37.410 --> 00:26:41.800
and so I think the other aspect
of that is that there was a time

00:26:41.800 --> 00:26:45.430 position:56%
when it was really hard to find, you
know, if you were a history teacher,

00:26:45.430 --> 00:26:47.510
for instance, and you want to
find some primary sources to bring

00:26:47.510 --> 00:26:49.550
into the classroom, it was
really difficult to do that,

00:26:49.550 --> 00:26:51.670
and it is not the case
anymore at all.

00:26:51.670 --> 00:26:52.970
In fact, it's the opposite.

00:26:52.970 --> 00:26:56.550
Really, I think that it's overload.

00:26:56.550 --> 00:27:01.230
There's so much out there, and to
go to all those sites and find one

00:27:01.230 --> 00:27:04.200
that you like best and
evaluate the different sites

00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:05.500
and what you want to use.

00:27:05.500 --> 00:27:07.660
I mean, it's a lot, especially

00:27:07.660 --> 00:27:10.890
for a time-crunched
population to start with.

00:27:10.890 --> 00:27:13.860
So I think just, you know,

00:27:13.860 --> 00:27:17.200
our central question here
is considerations designed

00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:18.500
for this audience.

00:27:18.500 --> 00:27:20.380
I mean, I think if you're designing
something, what we have found that,

00:27:20.380 --> 00:27:23.340
you know, the easier
it is the better,

00:27:23.340 --> 00:27:30.010
and not to make any statements
about intelligence by any means,

00:27:30.010 --> 00:27:35.780
but just the straightforwardness is
perhaps a better way to phrase it.

00:27:35.780 --> 00:27:40.030
You know, not a million accounts.

00:27:40.030 --> 00:27:43.100
You know, you have to take into
consideration school firewalls

00:27:43.100 --> 00:27:45.930
and things like that, but I
think the most direct access

00:27:45.930 --> 00:27:49.560
and the most straightforward
access can really be the best and,

00:27:49.560 --> 00:27:53.900
you know, sometimes the cleanest
access too with maybe some

00:27:53.900 --> 00:27:57.240
of that metadata hit and
maybe some historical context

00:27:57.240 --> 00:28:01.170
or whatever context, whatever
topic you're teaching,

00:28:01.170 --> 00:28:02.750
providing some of that.

00:28:02.750 --> 00:28:05.240
So it does take a little
bit of reframing, I think,

00:28:05.240 --> 00:28:07.210
the resources that we have.

00:28:07.210 --> 00:28:12.400 position:56%
So again, I guess kind of going back
on that, where translation, I think,

00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:18.170
it's a theme that's come up a lot
in our conversations about this.

00:28:18.170 --> 00:28:20.730
Go ahead, Brian.

00:28:20.730 --> 00:28:23.260
&gt;&gt; Brian Ausland: So, most
important, I mean that's kind

00:28:23.260 --> 00:28:28.250
of a hard thing to go on, and
when talking to both these ladies,

00:28:28.250 --> 00:28:32.050
I was talking to them about making
sure your metadata is transferable

00:28:32.050 --> 00:28:33.600
to systems like Learning Registry.

00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:35.950
So it can go out and
propagate into the environments

00:28:35.950 --> 00:28:38.200
that teachers are already having
promoted, and they're using it

00:28:38.200 --> 00:28:40.030
at their state and local levels.

00:28:40.030 --> 00:28:45.500
The game no more is -- there's no
more stake now involved in, "Well,

00:28:45.500 --> 00:28:47.030
how do we get them
to our website to go

00:28:47.030 --> 00:28:48.610
from those other websites
to get to our website?"

00:28:48.610 --> 00:28:50.170
That's a losing game.

00:28:50.170 --> 00:28:53.050
The idea is how do you get your
materials and content to make it

00:28:53.050 --> 00:28:57.060 position:56%
to where they're already trained and
adapted to use and funded to use,

00:28:57.060 --> 00:29:02.920 position:56%
and so I was looking at that talking
about, you know, do we want to talk

00:29:02.920 --> 00:29:07.170 position:56%
about metadata and discoverability,
but really, in talking to these two,

00:29:07.170 --> 00:29:08.620
and I said what's really important,

00:29:08.620 --> 00:29:10.030
particularly listening
to things this morning.

00:29:10.030 --> 00:29:11.330
I changed my mind.

00:29:11.330 --> 00:29:14.890
I said, "I'm not sure that people
recognize the transition that's

00:29:14.890 --> 00:29:16.420
happening right now in K-12.

00:29:16.420 --> 00:29:17.760
I just don't know."

00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:21.300 position:56%
Even in K-12, I don't think we fully
got our heads wrapped around it,

00:29:21.300 --> 00:29:28.170 position:56%
but in all reality, teachers, by
their nature, will scavenge anything

00:29:28.170 --> 00:29:32.080
for a classroom use and for
teaching and have a rich history

00:29:32.080 --> 00:29:36.140
and a deep-rooted inclination
in their DNA to do that

00:29:36.140 --> 00:29:38.140
and are really emerging right now.

00:29:38.140 --> 00:29:43.150
Policy wise, we're emerging from
20 years of very strict state

00:29:43.150 --> 00:29:46.420
and federal policies
saying, "You may not do that.

00:29:46.420 --> 00:29:48.880
You are subverting the
adopted curriculum,

00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:51.020
aligned to these high-stakes
standards, which are aligned

00:29:51.020 --> 00:29:52.690
to these high-stakes assessment."

00:29:52.690 --> 00:29:57.430
And it ran completely contrary to
the natural processes and behaviors

00:29:57.430 --> 00:30:00.380
of most of our highest
skilled teachers.

00:30:00.380 --> 00:30:04.610
Our most creative teachers, and
in fact, I was telling these two

00:30:04.610 --> 00:30:07.130
that it wasn't even three
years ago that we were working

00:30:07.130 --> 00:30:09.740
on a state project in
California, and we put a tool

00:30:09.740 --> 00:30:12.640 position:56%
up where teachers could just go grab
what we're now calling OER, which,

00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:14.070
I don't know what we
were calling it then.

00:30:14.070 --> 00:30:17.440
It's like all of the sudden it's
here at its new, but we have a term

00:30:17.440 --> 00:30:21.980
for it, OER, and we said, "Yeah,
they can assemble it and kind

00:30:21.980 --> 00:30:25.720
of create a background for it and
kind of create a canvas for it

00:30:25.720 --> 00:30:27.020
and put some questions there."

00:30:27.020 --> 00:30:30.130
And we were told by the State
Academic Deputy Superintendent

00:30:30.130 --> 00:30:32.250
at that time in California,
she said,

00:30:32.250 --> 00:30:34.190 position:56%
"You cannot have that tool in there.

00:30:34.190 --> 00:30:37.060
We cannot actively promote
a tool that's allowing them

00:30:37.060 --> 00:30:40.270
to build curriculum, a
third-rail curriculum,

00:30:40.270 --> 00:30:42.300
outside of the adopted materials

00:30:42.300 --> 00:30:45.290
that is the third largest
single expense in K-12.

00:30:45.290 --> 00:30:47.400
You're subverting that
entire expense,

00:30:47.400 --> 00:30:51.550
which only falls behind the
salary and facilities in K-12."

00:30:51.550 --> 00:30:54.100
And, I mean, that was it,
and that was state to state.

00:30:54.100 --> 00:30:57.960
That we now sit in a day where
just in the last six months,

00:30:57.960 --> 00:31:01.240
the Federal Department of
Education has a director of OER,

00:31:01.240 --> 00:31:04.760
and open education initiative, and
they're asking districts and states

00:31:04.760 --> 00:31:08.410
to sign on, which are signing on in
droves, on open education and tools

00:31:08.410 --> 00:31:11.600
that allow teachers to go find
wonderful resources as provided

00:31:11.600 --> 00:31:15.280
by many of the agencies represented
in this room, and many others,

00:31:15.280 --> 00:31:19.440
and build good learning exchanges
and activities for the students

00:31:19.440 --> 00:31:22.870
that they know so well, that
they spend 180-plus days

00:31:22.870 --> 00:31:27.030
with in groups of 20 to 30 kids.

00:31:27.030 --> 00:31:28.700
Of course that's who we want
developing the curriculum,

00:31:28.700 --> 00:31:32.220
and that's what teachers want
to do, and we're now in a place

00:31:32.220 --> 00:31:36.270
where we're basically, since
probably the mid-90s, right Letha,

00:31:36.270 --> 00:31:40.230
just saying, by the
way, you should do that

00:31:40.230 --> 00:31:42.050
and teachers are like,
"Great, thanks.

00:31:42.050 --> 00:31:44.850
We'll reconnect with that
inner curriculum designer."

00:31:44.850 --> 00:31:51.120
So I just urge people to recognize
it's going to be a reawakening.

00:31:51.120 --> 00:31:54.520
It's going to be a --
something, and in this time,

00:31:54.520 --> 00:31:56.160
it's very different
than 20 years ago.

00:31:56.160 --> 00:31:57.910
There's so much from
them to select from.

00:31:57.910 --> 00:32:01.330
If you thought teachers could do
some incredibly sophisticated,

00:32:01.330 --> 00:32:03.430
crazy tapestries with
just the things

00:32:03.430 --> 00:32:06.160
at their physical fingertips is
what looked like when I was still

00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:10.540
in the classroom, what we're giving
them access to now is going to be

00:32:10.540 --> 00:32:13.090
of incredible benefit to our
students and our learners,

00:32:13.090 --> 00:32:18.000
if we help them with that and give
them tools to guide that process.

00:32:22.040 --> 00:32:23.340
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Greenhut: All right,

00:32:23.340 --> 00:32:25.930
so I didn't realize I was
being a bit subversive

00:32:25.930 --> 00:32:32.910
when I was teaching but, you know,
so we wanted to talk a little bit

00:32:32.910 --> 00:32:37.430
about what this means to put this
kind of control in teachers' hands.

00:32:37.430 --> 00:32:41.530
You know, what about
handing materials

00:32:41.530 --> 00:32:44.810
over to the teachers is
sort of raw materials

00:32:44.810 --> 00:32:48.080
and seeing what they come up with?

00:32:48.080 --> 00:32:53.820
And it's sort of, you
know, I think it's a bit

00:32:53.820 --> 00:32:55.610
of a trick question really.

00:32:55.610 --> 00:33:00.030
I don't think we're ever putting
control in the teachers' hands,

00:33:00.030 --> 00:33:02.160
because they're taking it anyway.

00:33:02.160 --> 00:33:04.040
You know, they were taking
control the first place,

00:33:04.040 --> 00:33:07.670
but as Brian explained earlier,
it was more of a manual cutting

00:33:07.670 --> 00:33:14.470
and pasting and pulling things
together using various other tools

00:33:14.470 --> 00:33:19.710
and platforms and, you know, I
can remember when I first came

00:33:19.710 --> 00:33:22.910
to the Archives, as I mentioned,
I had just been teaching

00:33:22.910 --> 00:33:28.420
in the classroom, and, you know I
had come fresh off the subversive

00:33:28.420 --> 00:33:30.720
stint of cobbling things together,

00:33:30.720 --> 00:33:33.720
but that's what I knew
everyone else to be doing too.

00:33:33.720 --> 00:33:36.260
You know, we never
downloaded the lesson plan

00:33:36.260 --> 00:33:37.840
or found a lesson plan as is.

00:33:37.840 --> 00:33:41.140
We were always pulling it
apart, disassembling it,

00:33:41.140 --> 00:33:42.440
putting it with other pieces.

00:33:42.440 --> 00:33:45.680
You know, rarely teaching a
lesson plan from start to finish

00:33:45.680 --> 00:33:48.150
in one class period, because
(a) it might have been written

00:33:48.150 --> 00:33:52.300
for a 55-minute class period,
and yours are actually 42 minutes

00:33:52.300 --> 00:33:55.910
because why they can
be even numbers,

00:33:55.910 --> 00:33:57.420
I don't know, but they can't.

00:33:57.420 --> 00:34:04.370
So, but, you might not want
a full lesson for 42 minutes.

00:34:04.370 --> 00:34:06.140
You might want activities
here and there.

00:34:06.140 --> 00:34:07.830
So, you know, your
class gets cut short,

00:34:07.830 --> 00:34:10.190
you can bump this 15-minute
activity.

00:34:10.190 --> 00:34:14.240
You know, so we just knew that
teachers were teaching with chunks

00:34:14.240 --> 00:34:19.350
of activities and putting them
together, how they thought worked

00:34:19.350 --> 00:34:22.350
for their students in their
classroom, and sometimes,

00:34:22.350 --> 00:34:25.970
as Brian mentioned, for
differently for different classes.

00:34:25.970 --> 00:34:29.420
You know, for fourth period this
way, for sixth period, this way,

00:34:29.420 --> 00:34:31.640
because that's how
they're going to get it,

00:34:31.640 --> 00:34:34.600
and so when we started thinking

00:34:34.600 --> 00:34:38.210
about creating what would become
DocsTeach, we were thinking a lot

00:34:38.210 --> 00:34:40.480
about that, and so we just
kind of made the decision.

00:34:40.480 --> 00:34:43.160
You know, it's happening anyway.

00:34:43.160 --> 00:34:46.150
So what if we just give
teachers a place to do it.

00:34:46.150 --> 00:34:51.810
Let them do it here, and you
know, of course, that meant,

00:34:51.810 --> 00:34:53.620
well, this is on our website.

00:34:53.620 --> 00:34:56.040
So, you know, how are
we going to do that?

00:34:56.040 --> 00:35:00.240 position:56%
And what we decided to do is there's
sort of a tiered publication system.

00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:02.610
So a teacher can publish
an activity.

00:35:02.610 --> 00:35:05.920
It's available to other teachers
that have logged into the site.

00:35:05.920 --> 00:35:09.120
So you're sort of registering
and logging in and pulling

00:35:09.120 --> 00:35:12.760
up from this pool, but if you
just happen to be a casual visitor

00:35:12.760 --> 00:35:15.750
and you find, you come to the
site, you only see these activities

00:35:15.750 --> 00:35:18.770
that the National Archives
education staff has created.

00:35:18.770 --> 00:35:20.100
So they were still there.

00:35:20.100 --> 00:35:24.700
The value is there, but it's, you
know, if you were not so familiar

00:35:24.700 --> 00:35:27.800
with the site, you wouldn't
necessarily think that everything

00:35:27.800 --> 00:35:29.340
that is there was created by us.

00:35:29.340 --> 00:35:33.300
So that was one way that we were
kind of able to do it in sort

00:35:33.300 --> 00:35:36.760
of address that fear that some
people had of, you know, well,

00:35:36.760 --> 00:35:40.700
what is somebody creates a
really bad activity or, you know,

00:35:40.700 --> 00:35:42.000
we don't want to look bad.

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:45.640
You know, we're sort
of a model here.

00:35:45.640 --> 00:35:47.750
You know, we want to
have a good name.

00:35:47.750 --> 00:35:51.400
That's one way we address
that, but I think, you know,

00:35:51.400 --> 00:35:55.820
one part of this question
that we want to talk about,

00:35:55.820 --> 00:35:57.550
what are the advantages
of giving this kind

00:35:57.550 --> 00:35:58.850
of control to the teachers?

00:35:58.850 --> 00:36:01.020
Well, you know, for us anyway,

00:36:01.020 --> 00:36:06.850
we currently on DocsTeach have 104
National Archives Education staff

00:36:06.850 --> 00:36:11.710
created activities, but our users
have created over 20,000 activities

00:36:11.710 --> 00:36:14.000
and over 3000 of those
have been published.

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:18.490
So, obviously, big difference
if you log in and what is there,

00:36:18.490 --> 00:36:21.590
and the site's always
changing, always growing.

00:36:21.590 --> 00:36:23.720
You know, and it's
a way for us to do

00:36:23.720 --> 00:36:29.170
that without our staff constantly
creating these new activities.

00:36:29.170 --> 00:36:31.730
It also meant a difference when
we were designing the site,

00:36:31.730 --> 00:36:38.070
because we put a lot of time into
thinking about the user experience

00:36:38.070 --> 00:36:44.870
in terms of building tools, not
writing lessons, and so, you know,

00:36:44.870 --> 00:36:49.520
we -- our staff is very familiar
with our holdings and the kinds

00:36:49.520 --> 00:36:53.770
of primary sources that we have in
our holdings and how those might,

00:36:53.770 --> 00:36:57.650
you know, be useful in the
classroom, and so what we decided

00:36:57.650 --> 00:37:02.230
to focus our efforts one, was
thinking about tools and ways

00:37:02.230 --> 00:37:04.330
that were broad, you know,

00:37:04.330 --> 00:37:07.380
broad themes about how you might
use these in the classroom.

00:37:07.380 --> 00:37:10.680
Turning those into real-life
tools on this website,

00:37:10.680 --> 00:37:12.540
and then the teachers can plug

00:37:12.540 --> 00:37:15.040
in different primary
sources that they find.

00:37:15.040 --> 00:37:18.920
So it's putting in their
hands so they can customize it

00:37:18.920 --> 00:37:20.990
for their classroom, like
they were going to do anyway,

00:37:20.990 --> 00:37:24.820
but now it's up an online and,
you know, a student can click

00:37:24.820 --> 00:37:29.240
on this URL without them having
to create the webpage or whatever.

00:37:29.240 --> 00:37:32.170
You know, and it also
turned into kind of a tool

00:37:32.170 --> 00:37:33.830
that we can use ourselves.

00:37:33.830 --> 00:37:36.080
You know, we will use
the site to, you know,

00:37:36.080 --> 00:37:38.970
if we do a conference presentation
or a teacher workshop or something

00:37:38.970 --> 00:37:40.440
like that, where we're
able to use it.

00:37:40.440 --> 00:37:43.410
If we need to create education
materials surrounding an exhibit,

00:37:43.410 --> 00:37:48.810
we can use this tool that we made
because it is, you know, template,

00:37:48.810 --> 00:37:50.390
really, multiple templates.

00:37:50.390 --> 00:37:51.700
There's 11 different tools.

00:37:51.700 --> 00:37:58.360
So, you know, we can use it
ourselves in addition to teachers,

00:37:58.360 --> 00:38:06.390
but I think, in my opinion, the
biggest thing, the biggest reason

00:38:06.390 --> 00:38:12.880
to do this kind of thing is
I will always remember I went

00:38:12.880 --> 00:38:17.020
and did a presentation over
in Fairfax County in Virginia.

00:38:17.020 --> 00:38:19.260
I used to teach there, and
I went back after I worked

00:38:19.260 --> 00:38:21.760
at the National Archives,
and we had created DocsTeach

00:38:21.760 --> 00:38:23.830
and did a presentation is part

00:38:23.830 --> 00:38:25.960
of their social studies
secondary teacher in-service.

00:38:25.960 --> 00:38:28.390
So it's all the middle school,
high school social studies teachers

00:38:28.390 --> 00:38:31.460
in Fairfax County, and they asked
me to do a DocsTeach presentation,

00:38:31.460 --> 00:38:33.490
but then they had this teacher
that also wanted to, and I said,

00:38:33.490 --> 00:38:35.390
"Well, let's do it together."

00:38:35.390 --> 00:38:40.180
And, you know, I just always,
it made an impression on me

00:38:40.180 --> 00:38:43.580
because he really could
care less that I was there.

00:38:43.580 --> 00:38:45.540
He didn't care that I
had help create the site.

00:38:45.540 --> 00:38:47.540
He wasn't impressed in
any way, shape, or form.

00:38:47.540 --> 00:38:52.360 position:56%
All he wanted to do was get up there
and show his work that he had done,

00:38:52.360 --> 00:38:57.390 position:56%
you know, and it just really made me
realize that this is his site too,

00:38:57.390 --> 00:38:59.520
and all the teachers
that are using it.

00:38:59.520 --> 00:39:02.580
This is really their work that
is there, and they really look

00:39:02.580 --> 00:39:07.290
at it is their site too, and you
know, I do think probably also,

00:39:07.290 --> 00:39:11.000 position:56%
from a practical standpoint, that,
you know, that can help a little bit

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:13.770
with word of mouth, too, when
you're trying to promote your site.

00:39:13.770 --> 00:39:16.680
You know, we did zero marketing.

00:39:16.680 --> 00:39:20.510
We didn't promote the site at all,
but you know, so all the growth

00:39:20.510 --> 00:39:24.700
that it has seen, which has
been steady is, you know,

00:39:24.700 --> 00:39:28.660
I think is in large part because of
that kind of feeling of ownership

00:39:28.660 --> 00:39:31.340
that teachers have and they share
their activities, and therefore,

00:39:31.340 --> 00:39:33.110
are interested in sharing
it with others.

00:39:33.110 --> 00:39:37.230
So I think there's real benefits to
kind of handing that control over,

00:39:37.230 --> 00:39:39.700
even though, like I said,
I don't really think --

00:39:39.700 --> 00:39:42.090
it's going to happen anyway.

00:39:42.090 --> 00:39:43.390
&gt;&gt; Brian Ausland: Thank you.

00:39:43.390 --> 00:39:44.920
I'll let you just --

00:39:44.920 --> 00:39:46.220
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Greenhut:Sure.

00:39:46.220 --> 00:39:47.520 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Brian Ausland: Just hustle those.

00:39:47.520 --> 00:39:48.820
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Greenhut: Yeah,
I'm going to really hustle

00:39:48.820 --> 00:39:50.310
because I'm a hustler on the
roundtable, because we do want

00:39:50.310 --> 00:39:51.610
to take some questions from you.

00:39:51.610 --> 00:39:57.120
So we wanted to and by thinking
about useful first steps for folks

00:39:57.120 --> 00:39:59.120
who were maybe getting
started with thinking about how

00:39:59.120 --> 00:40:01.370
to do education work with
a digital collection.

00:40:01.370 --> 00:40:04.680
So our first piece of advice
is, even though we talked a lot

00:40:04.680 --> 00:40:07.070
and are going to talk again in
a second about using teachers

00:40:07.070 --> 00:40:09.530
in the process, that does
not mean that you don't have

00:40:09.530 --> 00:40:12.690
to do some really basic
curriculum research on your side.

00:40:12.690 --> 00:40:17.100
So learn what inquiry-based
instruction is.

00:40:17.100 --> 00:40:19.660
If you're going to design a
project that's primarily for sort

00:40:19.660 --> 00:40:20.960
of a state history audience.

00:40:20.960 --> 00:40:23.700
Like find and do some reading
in your state history standards

00:40:23.700 --> 00:40:27.050
to figure out what is covered
in them and what is not.

00:40:27.050 --> 00:40:30.310
If you're going to be terrified by
broad ideas like the Common Core,

00:40:30.310 --> 00:40:32.060
and you're working with
digital primary sources,

00:40:32.060 --> 00:40:33.570
figure out where primary
sources show

00:40:33.570 --> 00:40:35.910
up in the Common Core state
standards, and if you're working

00:40:35.910 --> 00:40:38.550
with social studies in history,
look at the C3 framework.

00:40:38.550 --> 00:40:41.520
It's useful to begin
to develop a sense,

00:40:41.520 --> 00:40:44.750
even if you are not an educator
of what is and is not curricular

00:40:44.750 --> 00:40:48.250
and what folks might actually be
trying to use your primary sources

00:40:48.250 --> 00:40:49.970
to do and an instructional way.

00:40:49.970 --> 00:40:52.700
Again, even if you're not going
to be the expert on the team,

00:40:52.700 --> 00:40:55.450
I think you have to some of
that knowledge to start sorting

00:40:55.450 --> 00:40:58.020
through what is probably a
large group of digital objects

00:40:58.020 --> 00:41:00.710
and figuring out which ones
are more or less useful.

00:41:00.710 --> 00:41:04.390
We've talked about this
a lot, but also find ways

00:41:04.390 --> 00:41:08.450
to involve teachers realistically
but iteratively in the process

00:41:08.450 --> 00:41:09.750
of building your project.

00:41:09.750 --> 00:41:11.050
So get them involved
in several stages.

00:41:11.050 --> 00:41:12.640
Get them to do some review,
give you some feedback,

00:41:12.640 --> 00:41:14.120
get them involved in planning.

00:41:14.120 --> 00:41:16.550 position:56%
Check in with them and see how they
think what you've developed is going

00:41:16.550 --> 00:41:17.850
and how useful they find it.

00:41:17.850 --> 00:41:20.620
We cannot emphasize that enough.

00:41:20.620 --> 00:41:22.670
And also, we've talked about
this some already, but be willing

00:41:22.670 --> 00:41:25.380
to do some of the heavy
lifting for teachers.

00:41:25.380 --> 00:41:28.290
Help with some of that
initial sorting of content

00:41:28.290 --> 00:41:31.510
by doing your curriculum
research and also help with some

00:41:31.510 --> 00:41:33.470
of the burden of that
active translation.

00:41:33.470 --> 00:41:36.940
That is, transforming an
initial version of metadata

00:41:36.940 --> 00:41:38.360
into potentially a more student

00:41:38.360 --> 00:41:40.060
and teacher friendly
version of metadata.

00:41:40.060 --> 00:41:41.360
I know that the folks

00:41:41.360 --> 00:41:44.240
on our Education Advisory Committee
have done a lot of that work,

00:41:44.240 --> 00:41:45.600
but it's tedious handmade work,

00:41:45.600 --> 00:41:47.680
and so you can help
your project get a jump

00:41:47.680 --> 00:41:51.180
by learning those skills
behind the scenes.

00:41:51.180 --> 00:41:53.560
And Franky answered question five.

00:41:53.560 --> 00:41:57.110
So I know we have just a couple
of minutes, but we really do want,

00:41:57.110 --> 00:42:00.010
as we said, to take some questions
from the audience, as well.

00:42:00.010 --> 00:42:02.570
Yes?

00:42:02.570 --> 00:42:09.660
&gt;&gt; Can you give me an
example of providing a context

00:42:09.660 --> 00:42:11.440
for metadata [inaudible].

00:42:11.440 --> 00:42:13.100
&gt;&gt; Franky Abbott: Sure
do you want me to --

00:42:13.100 --> 00:42:15.260
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Greenhut: Take
that if you would like, but --

00:42:15.260 --> 00:42:16.560
&gt;&gt; Franky Abbott: Go for it.

00:42:16.560 --> 00:42:20.230 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Greenhut: Well, I think
it could mean different things.

00:42:20.230 --> 00:42:29.070
In our context, we are -- I have
fellow staff members in the room.

00:42:29.070 --> 00:42:35.190
So, you know, there's a
lot of archival speak going

00:42:35.190 --> 00:42:38.840
on in our online catalog,
for instance,

00:42:38.840 --> 00:42:41.980 position:56%
and so we pull resources from there.

00:42:41.980 --> 00:42:45.240
We pull the digital objects
from there, and we do pull some

00:42:45.240 --> 00:42:50.000
of the metadata, but we don't
pull all of it, and in addition,

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:54.170
we will sometimes,
it's not even creating.

00:42:54.170 --> 00:42:58.300
Sometimes it's more I scavenge
like nobody's business.

00:42:58.300 --> 00:43:01.370
You know, maybe it was in
an exhibit that we had,

00:43:01.370 --> 00:43:03.830
and I'll go pull the
exhibit label text.

00:43:03.830 --> 00:43:08.540
You know, so it's sort
of identifying, you know,

00:43:08.540 --> 00:43:12.340
because our archival catalog
might not have, you know,

00:43:12.340 --> 00:43:14.230
we might know the photographer.

00:43:14.230 --> 00:43:16.460
We might know the local identifier.

00:43:16.460 --> 00:43:19.810
We might know the, you know,
record group series and file unit,

00:43:19.810 --> 00:43:24.040
but that's relevant in the
classroom, and I mean, it is.

00:43:24.040 --> 00:43:27.770
I mean, it's not -- not irrelevant
entirely, but it's good to know

00:43:27.770 --> 00:43:30.900
where information comes from,
for sure, but, you know,

00:43:30.900 --> 00:43:32.310
if we could provide a little bit

00:43:32.310 --> 00:43:34.630
of historical context
in addition to that.

00:43:34.630 --> 00:43:39.330
Sometimes it's even, I will go in,
and we don't really know that much

00:43:39.330 --> 00:43:42.480
but we know this is a
photograph from a series of,

00:43:42.480 --> 00:43:44.860
you know, Army Corps of Engineers.

00:43:44.860 --> 00:43:46.160
I'm not sure.

00:43:46.160 --> 00:43:48.930
You know, and we can actually
even just rephrase the metadata

00:43:48.930 --> 00:43:50.230
that we have.

00:43:50.230 --> 00:43:53.920
So we can say this photograph comes
from a series of photographs taken

00:43:53.920 --> 00:43:59.080
at this time from the Army Corps of
Engineers or something like that.

00:43:59.080 --> 00:44:00.380
You know what I mean?

00:44:00.380 --> 00:44:02.360
So sometimes it's just
rephrasing things.

00:44:02.360 --> 00:44:04.400
&gt;&gt; Franky Abbott: As long as
something is a known item,

00:44:04.400 --> 00:44:06.040
I would imagine you would find
these in the National Archives,

00:44:06.040 --> 00:44:09.490 position:56%
where it's a fairly famous document,
but the record isn't super full

00:44:09.490 --> 00:44:11.870
about what it is, and so,
you know, sometimes students

00:44:11.870 --> 00:44:14.230
or teachers might appreciate
a couple of sentences more

00:44:14.230 --> 00:44:18.870
of description, or so you have
a portrait of a famous person,

00:44:18.870 --> 00:44:20.590
you know, painted in
a particular year,

00:44:20.590 --> 00:44:23.780
but the description isn't even
making a speculative connection

00:44:23.780 --> 00:44:25.840
between the time period of the
portrait and what was going

00:44:25.840 --> 00:44:27.140
on in the person's life, right?

00:44:27.140 --> 00:44:29.640
So it's sort of a combination
of those things.

00:44:29.640 --> 00:44:31.030
I mean, obviously, we're not trying

00:44:31.030 --> 00:44:33.830
to like write a story
that can't say existed.

00:44:33.830 --> 00:44:35.130
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Greenhut:
Yeah, we don't have time,

00:44:35.130 --> 00:44:38.430
so it is about doing it in
an efficient manner too.

00:44:38.430 --> 00:44:41.550
You know, it also can be
renaming things that are --

00:44:41.550 --> 00:44:44.850
you know, we have some naming
conventions in our field

00:44:44.850 --> 00:44:48.760
that might not translate as
well for a student reading it.

00:44:48.760 --> 00:44:50.090
That kind of a thing.

00:44:50.090 --> 00:44:51.390
&gt;&gt; Franky Abbott: Titling
is actually the final thing.

00:44:51.390 --> 00:44:52.690
I mean, our project
is very dependent

00:44:52.690 --> 00:44:54.990
on an item having the
right kind of title.

00:44:54.990 --> 00:44:57.570
Because that in a thumbnail or the
thing that will attract somebody

00:44:57.570 --> 00:45:01.760
to learn more about it, and so
the title is like "Man on Horse,"

00:45:01.760 --> 00:45:03.060
and that man is George Washington,

00:45:03.060 --> 00:45:04.880
then we want to get
George Washington

00:45:04.880 --> 00:45:06.370
into the title of the item, right?

00:45:06.370 --> 00:45:09.350
Or else nobody's going to go look
at Man on Horse in the context

00:45:09.350 --> 00:45:11.940
of a George Washington
related primary source set,

00:45:11.940 --> 00:45:13.800
because they won't care, because
they won't make that connection.

00:45:13.800 --> 00:45:16.900
So some of it is also like
that rearranging of information

00:45:16.900 --> 00:45:18.910
in the metadata than it
necessarily is like --

00:45:18.910 --> 00:45:20.610
and sometimes it is
building in some more story.

00:45:20.610 --> 00:45:21.910
I don't know.

00:45:21.910 --> 00:45:23.210
It just kind of depends.

00:45:23.210 --> 00:45:24.510
Is that helpful?

00:45:24.510 --> 00:45:25.810 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Greenhut: Yeah, I mean,
just the other day, we renamed,

00:45:25.810 --> 00:45:29.100
you know we have Act to Alien.

00:45:29.100 --> 00:45:31.340
I'm like, oh, that's the
Alien and Sedition Act.

00:45:31.340 --> 00:45:32.650
Let's call it that instead.

00:45:32.650 --> 00:45:34.950
You know, that kind of thing.

00:45:34.950 --> 00:45:36.250
&gt;&gt; Brian Ausland: Or we had --

00:45:36.250 --> 00:45:38.730
we did just an activity
just with teachers

00:45:38.730 --> 00:45:43.700
where we gave them a campaign
prop from Abraham Lincoln's,

00:45:43.700 --> 00:45:49.520
as he was developing a campaign
strategy and run for presidency,

00:45:49.520 --> 00:45:52.690
and his political party created
the term "rail splitter."

00:45:52.690 --> 00:45:55.210
That's a political term for
him, and they were trying

00:45:55.210 --> 00:45:58.310
to paint a certain picture
for the party of the day.

00:45:58.310 --> 00:46:00.850
So they have one of their
-- it looks like a hatchet.

00:46:00.850 --> 00:46:03.160
Looks like in ax, but
it's just a prop.

00:46:03.160 --> 00:46:06.840
It's all wood, and all the data
about it is the type of wood.

00:46:06.840 --> 00:46:11.230
Where the burn mark that's on
it came from a fire in 1921

00:46:11.230 --> 00:46:13.070
in a warehouse, and so we put it in
front of teachers, and then this is

00:46:13.070 --> 00:46:14.590
where I advocate for my prototypes.

00:46:14.590 --> 00:46:17.850
We put it in front of the teachers,
and they would see the metadata,

00:46:17.850 --> 00:46:21.410
and we had the dossiers and the
curators for that particular piece

00:46:21.410 --> 00:46:23.200
and other pieces represented in
the room to watch and observe

00:46:23.200 --> 00:46:24.500
as we worked with these
teacher teams,

00:46:24.500 --> 00:46:25.800
and we would just basically say,

00:46:25.800 --> 00:46:28.910
"What if -- highlight
things that you like."

00:46:28.910 --> 00:46:32.290
And our prototype would capture
what teachers highlighted.

00:46:32.290 --> 00:46:34.040
Get rid of things that
aren't of value to you.

00:46:34.040 --> 00:46:38.250
Assign a standard to this that you
could potentially teach with this.

00:46:38.250 --> 00:46:40.060
Assign a topic to this
or a concept you could --

00:46:40.060 --> 00:46:41.360
and we would just collect
that data as part

00:46:41.360 --> 00:46:43.180
of our testing, and
then we'd go back.

00:46:43.180 --> 00:46:45.940
So when we find things
like the teacher --

00:46:45.940 --> 00:46:47.240
like some teacher would complete.

00:46:47.240 --> 00:46:49.160
The one I love that the teacher
completely erased everything

00:46:49.160 --> 00:46:50.460
about it and they put, "This
is what Abe Lincoln used

00:46:50.460 --> 00:46:51.760
to kill a vampire with."

00:46:51.760 --> 00:46:56.540
And I thought one of the ladies

00:46:56.540 --> 00:46:58.490
from the American History
Room was going to faint.

00:46:58.490 --> 00:47:02.520
She was so upset that
they typed that in there,

00:47:02.520 --> 00:47:04.150
but then the teacher put that in

00:47:04.150 --> 00:47:06.710
and explained why you made the
modifications that you did,

00:47:06.710 --> 00:47:08.910
and her explanation of
this, fourth grade teacher,

00:47:08.910 --> 00:47:11.700
was she said to grab their
attention, and then to move them

00:47:11.700 --> 00:47:13.130
to place of understanding
what it is.

00:47:13.130 --> 00:47:14.810
&gt;&gt; Franky Abbott: It's curricular.

00:47:14.810 --> 00:47:18.400
&gt;&gt; Brian Ausland: Right,
but it was absolutely false,

00:47:18.400 --> 00:47:21.700
but that was summer, the
summer that movie came out,

00:47:21.700 --> 00:47:23.760
which the curator wasn't
familiar with that movie.

00:47:23.760 --> 00:47:25.060
So it was --

00:47:25.060 --> 00:47:27.600
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Greenhut: To be
clear, we're not advocating

00:47:27.600 --> 00:47:29.060
that type of metadata, but --

00:47:29.060 --> 00:47:31.830
&gt;&gt; Brian Ausland: Aside from
pulling your own metadata,

00:47:31.830 --> 00:47:35.860
we were also looking at what
teachers find a value or not,

00:47:35.860 --> 00:47:38.610
and if they could change of how
they change it, and by the way,

00:47:38.610 --> 00:47:42.040
Smithsonian made a very
bold step in their system.

00:47:42.040 --> 00:47:46.090
The teachers can write
their own metadata,

00:47:46.090 --> 00:47:48.130
write their own descriptive
data for instruction use,

00:47:48.130 --> 00:47:49.430
which actually is paradata.

00:47:49.430 --> 00:47:51.440
I do want to get into
the weeds on that,

00:47:51.440 --> 00:47:54.030
but the resident metadata is still
there for their access and use

00:47:54.030 --> 00:47:56.280
as well, but they get
the kind of forward

00:47:56.280 --> 00:47:57.580
that the kids see originally.

00:47:57.580 --> 00:47:59.720
&gt;&gt; Franky Abbott: Let's
take your question

00:47:59.720 --> 00:48:04.250
because you have had your hand
raised since the beginning,

00:48:04.250 --> 00:48:12.010
and then people can ask other
questions maybe afterwards.

00:48:12.010 --> 00:48:14.970
&gt;&gt; So how would you [inaudible]?

00:48:16.350 --> 00:48:19.000
&gt;&gt; Franky Abbott: So ours
are -- our site is young,

00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:21.020
which means that we're not
going to be getting the kind

00:48:21.020 --> 00:48:22.630
of traffic you are, because
we've only been online

00:48:22.630 --> 00:48:26.470
for about eight months, but
our site, since it's been up,

00:48:26.470 --> 00:48:30.720 position:56%
has already brought I think about
25,000 new users to DPLA as a whole,

00:48:30.720 --> 00:48:35.870 position:56%
and that project has seen in the
hundreds of thousands of page views.

00:48:35.870 --> 00:48:39.730
I could share some stats with
you if you're interested.

00:48:39.730 --> 00:48:41.670
We have done a little bit
of preliminary research

00:48:41.670 --> 00:48:44.780
about how often those are coming
from like within school districts,

00:48:44.780 --> 00:48:47.580
IP addresses, and things like
that, but the DPLA is sort

00:48:47.580 --> 00:48:50.140
of the next frontier for our
project is an assessment of kind

00:48:50.140 --> 00:48:52.380
of exactly how the
resources are being used,

00:48:52.380 --> 00:48:54.880
and how often they're being used
by random people on the Internet

00:48:54.880 --> 00:48:57.750
versus people in actual classroom
settings, which is, of course,

00:48:57.750 --> 00:49:00.240
something that happens anytime you
put something up on the Internet.

00:49:00.240 --> 00:49:01.540
Do you want to answer
what you know about it?

00:49:01.540 --> 00:49:02.840
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Greenhut:
Yeah, sure, I mean,

00:49:02.840 --> 00:49:06.490
I'm happy to share
specific numbers too.

00:49:06.490 --> 00:49:09.110
One thing I always really
appreciated about going in

00:49:09.110 --> 00:49:13.940 position:56%
and looking at our analytics is that
there's a precipitous drop in July

00:49:13.940 --> 00:49:18.740
and August and December, and
it always makes me so happy

00:49:18.740 --> 00:49:21.990
because it means that
the audience we designed

00:49:21.990 --> 00:49:23.680
for is who is using the site.

00:49:23.680 --> 00:49:24.980
So it's great.

00:49:24.980 --> 00:49:31.280
We have, you know, we're six
years old, I guess, almost now

00:49:31.280 --> 00:49:37.880
and we have had, I'm not going to
compete with Learning Lab probably,

00:49:37.880 --> 00:49:41.410
but we've had over
40,000 registered users.

00:49:41.410 --> 00:49:44.640
But don't let that number for you.

00:49:44.640 --> 00:49:46.870
That doesn't mean we
have 40,000 people active

00:49:46.870 --> 00:49:49.950
on the site on any given month.

00:49:49.950 --> 00:49:53.650
But those are just our
registered users who sign up.

00:49:53.650 --> 00:49:56.810
You know, we're also kind of trying
to think about, okay, how are,

00:49:56.810 --> 00:49:58.420
you know, that's one
other thing we've realized

00:49:58.420 --> 00:50:04.070
that we do get some other traffic
besides school-related traffic,

00:50:04.070 --> 00:50:09.450
and others are using the site just
to find the history enthusiasts

00:50:09.450 --> 00:50:14.830
out there because they, you
know, like the search feature.

00:50:16.040 --> 00:50:19.520
You know, we're constantly adding
more primary sources to it.

00:50:19.520 --> 00:50:22.850
You know, we have, you
know, hundreds of thousands

00:50:22.850 --> 00:50:26.490 position:56%
in our catalog, but we only have
8000 primary sources there, because,

00:50:26.490 --> 00:50:30.050
you know, we are really
trying to pick ones

00:50:30.050 --> 00:50:32.570
that we think are most useful.

00:50:32.570 --> 00:50:37.940
But we're in, I think we've had
over like 12 million page views.

00:50:37.940 --> 00:50:42.550
You know, so what I like
to see is the growth.

00:50:42.550 --> 00:50:46.320
You know, the year-over-year growth
we've really seen, and again,

00:50:46.320 --> 00:50:49.440
it's kind of fun because we
haven't done any marketing.

00:50:49.440 --> 00:50:56.200
So it's just spreading
word-of-mouth.

00:50:56.200 --> 00:50:57.500
&gt;&gt; Franky Abbott: Did you have a --

00:50:57.500 --> 00:51:00.610
did you want to say anything
afterwards, we're overtime?

00:51:00.610 --> 00:51:01.910
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Greenhut: Yeah.

00:51:01.910 --> 00:51:03.210
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Greenhut:
We're overtime.

00:51:03.210 --> 00:51:05.050
&gt;&gt; Brian Ausland: We
haven't launched yet.

00:51:05.050 --> 00:51:06.910
It's available.

00:51:06.910 --> 00:51:08.210
You can go online.

00:51:08.210 --> 00:51:09.510
It's technically in beta.

00:51:09.510 --> 00:51:10.810
That launch is in June.

00:51:10.810 --> 00:51:12.700
I guess what I can share with
you is they haven't launched

00:51:12.700 --> 00:51:19.570 position:56%
or done anything, and they have over
450 users that have just gone there

00:51:19.570 --> 00:51:22.390
and made accounts, and
then their premise was

00:51:22.390 --> 00:51:25.170
that just most people would
consume content and resources

00:51:25.170 --> 00:51:27.780
and not actually author or create,

00:51:27.780 --> 00:51:32.380
which research shows is probably
accurate, but they planned on,

00:51:32.380 --> 00:51:38.060
in their beta, just an open beta,
they planned on approximate 75

00:51:38.060 --> 00:51:41.510
to 100 teachers creating accounts.

00:51:41.510 --> 00:51:45.540 position:56%
Like I said, they have 450 plus
now, and they thought that about 15%

00:51:45.540 --> 00:51:50.030
of those teachers would create
stuff, and they have more like 87%

00:51:50.030 --> 00:51:51.730
of those teachers were
creating stuff, and they thought

00:51:51.730 --> 00:51:53.050
that they might have some
more, and they have 25

00:51:53.050 --> 00:51:54.350
to 50 max learning
collections offered

00:51:54.350 --> 00:51:57.460
by teachers, and they have 2000.

00:51:57.460 --> 00:52:00.880
So like I said, there
is something afoot.

00:52:00.880 --> 00:52:05.520
There is a reemergence and I think
there was something to be said

00:52:05.520 --> 00:52:09.120
for such diligence with
the design UI testing,

00:52:09.120 --> 00:52:13.760
and it's honed specifically
to allow teachers to come in.

00:52:13.760 --> 00:52:16.420
It's pretty low pressure,
and create.

00:52:16.420 --> 00:52:17.860
So...

00:52:17.860 --> 00:52:19.160
&gt;&gt; Franky Abbott: Thank you.

00:52:19.160 --> 00:52:20.460
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Greenhut: Thank you.

00:52:20.460 --> 00:52:22.260
Come ask is other questions
if you have them.

00:52:22.260 --> 00:52:27.680
[ Applause ]

00:52:27.680 --> 00:52:31.320
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of Library of Congress.
