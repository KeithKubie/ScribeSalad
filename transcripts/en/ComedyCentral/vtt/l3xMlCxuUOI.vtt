(cheerful jingle)

00:00:05.472 --> 00:00:08.441
- Happy Fourth of
July, Aunt Sam.

00:00:08.441 --> 00:00:10.343
- Whoa, whoa, careful.

00:00:10.343 --> 00:00:13.413 align:start size:94% position:6%
- Yes, are you ready,
bitch, to do this contest

00:00:13.413 --> 00:00:15.582
'cause it is every year and
it's like the only reason

00:00:15.582 --> 00:00:18.318 align:start size:81% position:19%
why I feel I still
am an American

00:00:18.318 --> 00:00:20.887 align:start size:97% position:3%
despite the current
administration, are you ready?

00:00:20.887 --> 00:00:22.522
- Yeah I was just gonna
say before you got into

00:00:22.522 --> 00:00:26.493 align:start size:94% position:6%
your whole thing, I don't
know if I can do it.

00:00:26.493 --> 00:00:27.994
- Did something happen, are you?

00:00:27.994 --> 00:00:31.431
- I was boiling the dogs and
I was smelling that hot water.

00:00:31.431 --> 00:00:33.066
- Don't tell me boiling the
dogs didn't make you want

00:00:33.066 --> 00:00:35.335
the dogs more.
- It didn't.

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.638
I don't want the dogs.

00:00:38.638 --> 00:00:39.973 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Okay.
- We've been doing this

00:00:39.973 --> 00:00:41.441
for a couple years, but
this isn't fun for me.

00:00:41.441 --> 00:00:42.675 align:start size:94% position:6%
- You know, I'm not
gonna let it get me down,

00:00:42.675 --> 00:00:44.177 align:start size:88% position:13%
I guess I'll just
compete against myself.

00:00:44.177 --> 00:00:47.213 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Yeah dude, this is your
thing, you are gonna kill it.

00:00:47.213 --> 00:00:48.815
- I have seven here today,
that's all I need to beat

00:00:48.815 --> 00:00:50.417
my own record.
- I'm gonna be

00:00:50.417 --> 00:00:51.484
your old man.

00:00:51.484 --> 00:00:53.353
Rocky old man.

00:00:53.353 --> 00:00:58.358
You got this, dude, I'm gonna
watch you as much as I can.

00:00:58.358 --> 00:01:00.960
You are skilled, you're amazing.

00:01:02.395 --> 00:01:04.564
You are my best friend for
a reason and it's right now.

00:01:04.564 --> 00:01:06.800 align:start size:94% position:6%
You are the representative
of our country.

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.334
You're the Statue of Liberty.

00:01:08.334 --> 00:01:10.003
You are so talented.

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:15.408
- No gagging, no gagging!

00:01:15.408 --> 00:01:16.509
- Dunk it!

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:18.278
That'll make it go.

00:01:18.278 --> 00:01:19.813
You having fun?

00:01:19.813 --> 00:01:24.517
Don't drink the dog water,
don't drink the dog water!

00:01:24.517 --> 00:01:25.518
Oh no, dude.

00:01:27.887 --> 00:01:28.721
You good?

00:01:30.423 --> 00:01:31.858
- I beat my record.

00:01:31.858 --> 00:01:34.694
(cheerful jingle)

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.332 align:start size:97% position:3%
What do you think the stripes
are in the American flag?

00:01:39.332 --> 00:01:41.634 align:start size:97% position:3%
They're hot dogs, they're
boiled and unboiled hot dogs,

00:01:41.634 --> 00:01:44.304
white and red and white and red.
