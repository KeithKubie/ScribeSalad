00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:05.060
Use the given information to
make a logical conclusion,

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:06.250
if possible.

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:08.280
If a logical conclusion
is not possible,

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.580
choose "no logical
conclusion possible."

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:12.110
All right.

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:13.401
So let's see what they tell us.

00:00:13.401 --> 00:00:16.300
So the statement is, if
I go to practice today,

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:18.760
then I will play in
the game tomorrow.

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:20.910
So this statement
is saying, look,

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.730
if I go to practice
today, then I'm

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:25.610
definitely going to play
in the game tomorrow.

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:29.950
And then they say, I will not
play in the game tomorrow.

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:32.809
Well, I just said that if
I go to practice today,

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:34.100
I'm going to play in that game.

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.141
And they just said, I'm
not playing in that game.

00:00:36.141 --> 00:00:38.850
So I must not be going
to practice today.

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.490
Because if I went, I would play.

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:45.030
So I did not go to practice.

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.070
So let's do a couple
more of these.

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:51.330
OK, so the same instructions.

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:56.760
If William misses the bus, then
he will be late for school.

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.560
William is late for school.

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:02.780
So let's think about
this a little bit.

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:05.910
If William misses the bus, then
he will be late for school.

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:07.710
William is late for school.

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.150
So missing the bus
is one way that you

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:11.490
could be late for school.

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.390
But he might have
not missed the bus.

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:18.950
He might have caught the bus,
but then kind of sat in the bus

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:19.930
once he got to school.

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:22.130
So missing the bus
is one of the ways

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:24.270
that he could be
late for school.

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.650
But it's not the only way
he could be late for school.

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:28.510
They just say, if
he misses the bus,

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:31.290
then he is late for school.

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.270
Now, if they said, he
is not late for school,

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:36.390
then you know that he
didn't miss the bus.

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.170
Because if he did, he
would have been late.

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:42.210
But there's many ways to be
late, not just missing the bus.

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.180
So we don't know for a fact
that William definitely

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.270
missed the bus.

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:49.600
Let's do a few more of these.

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.920
If a ray bisects an angle, so
it splits that angle in two,

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:57.700
then it creates two
congruent angles, all right?

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:00.880
If there are two
congruent angles,

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.860
then the two angles
have the same measure.

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:05.770
All right.

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:07.740
So this one's a
little bit more hairy.

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.560
So let's see, if a
ray bisects an angle,

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.101
then it creates two
congruent angles.

00:02:11.101 --> 00:02:12.800
Yep, OK, I can buy that.

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.630
In fact, that is
definitely true.

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:16.840
If there are two
congruent angles,

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.910
then the two angles
have the same measure.

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:21.330
OK, I can buy that, as well.

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:24.130
If a ray bisects an
angle, then the two angles

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:26.140
have the same measure.

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.900
So let's see.

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.910
So this first sentence says,
if a ray bisects an angle,

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.617
then it creates two
congruent angles.

00:02:32.617 --> 00:02:35.200
But then the next one says, if
there are two congruent angles,

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.620
then the two angles
have the same measure.

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.790
So if a ray bisects
an angle, there's

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:44.260
two congruent angles, which
the next sentence tells us

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.010
that the two angles
have the same measure.

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:48.280
And that's the statement here.

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.540
If a ray bisects an
angle, then the two angles

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:51.930
have the same measure.

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:54.390
And you're going to say, wait,
wait, how is this different?

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:57.990
Look, in the first sentence, it
says the ray bisecting an angle

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:00.170
creates two congruent angles.

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:03.370
So we don't know yet what
congruent angle means.

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:07.020
The next sentence says, if
there are two congruent angles,

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:09.220
then the two angles
have the same measure.

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:10.710
So the second
sentence lets us know

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:14.450
that two congruent angles
must have the same measure.

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:17.460
So now, we can kind of merge
these two together to say,

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:19.530
if a ray bisects
an angle, then it

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:22.070
creates two angles that
have the same measure, which

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:24.740
is this choice right over here.
