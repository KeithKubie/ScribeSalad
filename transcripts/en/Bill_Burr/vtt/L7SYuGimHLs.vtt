00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:04.800
Hey,
what's going on it's Bill Burr.
It's time for the Thursday afternoon,

2
00:00:04.801 --> 00:00:07.110
just before Friday,
Monday morning podcast and

3
00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:10.700
ahhh

4
00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:12.470
checking in on you.

5
00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:17.630
I'm just checking in on you seeing how your work week is going.

6
00:00:17.631 --> 00:00:22.610
I'll tell you right now,
it is a rainy,
gloomy,
um,

7
00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:26.800
Thursday afternoon out here in Los Angeles.
I'll tell you,
but you know,

8
00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:32.870
this is what happens every year.
It fucking rains.

9
00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:36.710
Everything turns green and for like a week it looks like Portland,

10
00:00:36.711 --> 00:00:41.711
Oregon out here and absolute paradise and then it just stops raining and then

11
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:45.650
the sun turns all of that Beautiful Green Shit Brown.

12
00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:48.890
And then the Santa Ana winds over the,

13
00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.920
they fucking like a giant nature's hairdryer just heats the stuff up and then we

14
00:00:54.771 --> 00:00:58.010
have our fires and it's totally 100% normal.

15
00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:02.900
And every fucking year when this place is burning down,

16
00:01:02.901 --> 00:01:06.290
somebody from back east always has to call me up.
You got towed.
You all right.

17
00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:10.670
What's up with those fires out there?
It's what the fuck happens.

18
00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:15.860
Do I call up people in Buffalo every eight though?
Hey,
all right.

19
00:01:15.861 --> 00:01:18.500
With that lake effect.
Snow.
What's up with debt?

20
00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:22.490
What's so with Niagara Falls and he's,
somebody should put a fence there.

21
00:01:22.491 --> 00:01:26.750
Somebodies got to go over
everywhere you live,

22
00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:31.110
there's something that makes them,

23
00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:32.840
you gotta pay a price

24
00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.620
70 70 degrees and gorgeous

25
00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.120
every fucking day.
You guys have seen me since I've moved out here.

26
00:01:42.121 --> 00:01:47.070
You've seen that?
Just,
just the JFK level.
Beautiful Tan,

27
00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:51.540
golden,
golden brown ginger that I am.
When I come to your shows,

28
00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.720
when I was living on the east coast,
I mean I was just like,

29
00:01:54.721 --> 00:01:56.850
it was like a fucking Casper.
The friendly ghost.

30
00:01:56.851 --> 00:01:58.650
If he actually gotten shaped the fat fuck.

31
00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.880
Granted my head was the same size as his,
you know,

32
00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:07.060
but ever since I moved out here,
man,
I'm telling you,

33
00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.480
people have really commented,
it's like bill for the first time in your life,

34
00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.230
he actually look human.
No,

35
00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:18.010
I'm still pasty is ever black and his ugly as ever.
Right.

36
00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:22.530
That's my biggie fucking line.
Pasty and his freckled is ever,

37
00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:26.860
um,
anyways.
Yes.
So this is,

38
00:02:26.861 --> 00:02:30.100
this is one of these days we just want to stay at and eat some stew.

39
00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:33.130
You know,
I love cooking,

40
00:02:33.131 --> 00:02:36.370
but I really hate the fucking music on every how to cook video.

41
00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:39.030
Why does it have to be just,

42
00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:43.270
it's so fucking like perky and everything's going to be great.

43
00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.900
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

44
00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.450
<v 1>You know,
why do I can't get it,
you know?
Any,</v>

45
00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:50.390
do you ever work in a fucking restaurant in the kitchen?

46
00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:52.930
I don't mean being the fucking good looking fucking

47
00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:57.980
dope shoe invites everybody into the restaurant.
Hi,
how are you?

48
00:02:57.981 --> 00:03:00.670
Maybe you'll fuck me if you order the right fucking food.
You know,

49
00:03:00.671 --> 00:03:04.800
not that person.
You know,
I swear to God,

50
00:03:04.801 --> 00:03:09.210
so much of beautiful women's game is given you hope.

51
00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:11.520
How far they can get in the game,

52
00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:14.250
how many times they can go around the board and collect $200 just,

53
00:03:14.251 --> 00:03:17.070
just on hope is,
it's fucking incredible.

54
00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:19.493
<v 0>MMM.</v>

55
00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:23.750
<v 1>Anyways,
I'm talking about,
did you ever work in the fucking kitchen?</v>

56
00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:26.283
<v 0>All right.</v>

57
00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.390
<v 1>Everybody back there,
you know,
half the people there,
if they don't have a record,</v>

58
00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:32.430
they're about ready to get arrested for something.

59
00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:37.400
There's always some sort of drugs going on.
Um,
it's,
yeah,

60
00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:41.730
it's just a lot of degenerates in the cooking industry.

61
00:03:41.731 --> 00:03:43.020
I just don't understand.

62
00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.590
Or maybe that's why they have such pleasant fucking music.

63
00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:49.920
You always have it staged.

64
00:03:49.921 --> 00:03:53.140
So it was this giant fucking kitchen and somebody just at home and they're

65
00:03:53.141 --> 00:03:56.920
always just like,
I love making toast.
You know,

66
00:03:56.921 --> 00:04:01.690
when I was a little girl,
just toast to me was just,

67
00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:04.150
I mean,
it just brought the family together,

68
00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:07.840
the sound of my mom pushing the toaster buttoned down,

69
00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:12.910
the smell of the bread.
Slowly crunching my dog,
muffin it,
my feet.

70
00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:18.850
I figured on a rainy fucking Thursday afternoon,

71
00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:21.160
we could recreate some of that.
You know,

72
00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:26.140
I just want somebody to make a fucking pork chop on youtube and talk about how

73
00:04:26.141 --> 00:04:30.100
much blow they did in the fucking eighties.
And now they can't even remember.

74
00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:32.920
They can't even believe that they can remember the difference between pork and

75
00:04:32.921 --> 00:04:33.754
poultry.

76
00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:39.970
They both begin with P and my drug dealers,
last name was Phillips.

77
00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:43.570
Um,
so it's very confusing time for me,
but as far as I remember,

78
00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:46.450
<v 0>sorry.
Um,</v>

79
00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:48.470
<v 1>anyways,</v>

80
00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:53.120
I worked last night I was down at the comedy and Magic Club on her most of

81
00:04:53.121 --> 00:04:55.950
beach.
Speaking of my lovely nonexistent Tam.

82
00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:57.800
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

83
00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:02.390
<v 1>Donald Trump literally looks like he has a halo of hair on his fucking head.</v>

84
00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:04.760
I just don't understand.
Why doesn't he just take their hair?

85
00:05:04.761 --> 00:05:06.170
Plugs are incredible now.

86
00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:11.990
Just take your shit from the back in paratroop that shit.
I Dunno.

87
00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:13.460
It's like he has that.

88
00:05:13.461 --> 00:05:16.250
Remember when Justin Bieber had like that comb over hair cut,

89
00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:19.490
which I really found offensive as a balding man.

90
00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:24.620
You know that some would mock my situation with a full head of hair and I'll be

91
00:05:24.621 --> 00:05:27.260
honest with you,
I don't think I ever quite forgave him for that.

92
00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:30.283
<v 0>Um,</v>

93
00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:33.640
<v 1>anyways,
I'm sorry,
I'm,
I'm all over the fucking map here.</v>

94
00:05:33.641 --> 00:05:34.520
What was I just talking about?

95
00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:39.340
It's talking about people doing blow in the backs of kitchens,
right?
No,

96
00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:42.810
it was past that.
Alright.
You know what,
it just,
Oh,

97
00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:46.840
I was down her most of beach doing a show with a blobby,

98
00:05:46.841 --> 00:05:48.910
call him Bobby Collins.

99
00:05:48.911 --> 00:05:52.480
We did a show down there to raise some money for a great charity.

100
00:05:52.481 --> 00:05:55.630
Went down there,
tried out a bunch of new stuff.
If you guys are in La,

101
00:05:55.631 --> 00:05:58.400
if you want to go to a great comedy,
I love that fucking place.

102
00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:03.640
And the people who run it and the level of like comedy Mike Memorabilia that

103
00:06:04.611 --> 00:06:08.660
they have down there is a,
is incredible.

104
00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:10.940
I believe that guy told me that,
uh,

105
00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:16.630
he has something of George Carlin's at George War on one of the specials,

106
00:06:16.761 --> 00:06:19.460
right?
And I like a window or something like that.
I'm almost afraid to say it.

107
00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:23.000
Some fucking loony ticket.
Go down there and try and steal it.

108
00:06:23.001 --> 00:06:24.730
But it's really incredible.
It's like a,

109
00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:27.200
it's like performing in the standup museum,

110
00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:33.000
especially when you saw how old my jokes were.
Sorry.
All right,

111
00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:35.630
let's talk about the Boston Bruins.

112
00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:39.110
Challis bill all belly freckles.

113
00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:43.480
I am back on the fucking bandwagon here.
Jesus Christ.

114
00:06:43.481 --> 00:06:47.090
Can somebody closed the door when they fucking flush the toilet there.
Um,

115
00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:55.400
um,
I watched the Columbus game,
which we lost in overtime.

116
00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:58.520
I miss last night,
which we also lost in overtime,

117
00:06:58.521 --> 00:07:02.180
but we still picked up two points.
All right?
We got a lot of people out.

118
00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:06.140
Evidently like the injury bug is not only hit the fucking Bruins,

119
00:07:06.141 --> 00:07:09.320
it's also hit the Celtics.
Kyrie Irving is messed up his knee.

120
00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:11.540
He was about supposed to be out for a few games.

121
00:07:11.541 --> 00:07:14.870
Now they're saying it looks even worse.
So I don't know what that means.

122
00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:18.950
You know the Celtics in not disclosing how he hurt his knee,

123
00:07:18.951 --> 00:07:21.530
but I think we all know,
okay,

124
00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:26.540
Kyrie thinks the world is flat and he was walking like it was flat and all of a

125
00:07:26.541 --> 00:07:29.780
sudden he got towards starts to,
you know,
go down a little bit and you know,

126
00:07:29.781 --> 00:07:32.190
it's like you ever walked down the stairs and you'd think you're the last one

127
00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:34.300
and you're not.
You know,

128
00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:36.680
you miss a stair for something like that or you think you're at the end and

129
00:07:36.681 --> 00:07:41.120
you're not.
I think he did that walking around his house just thinking,
well,

130
00:07:41.121 --> 00:07:44.510
the earth's flat.
I don't need to adjust to the circumference here.

131
00:07:45.690 --> 00:07:47.270
That's how he hurt his knee.
And that's a true story.

132
00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:49.250
But Ted Denato of the Bruins,

133
00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:54.920
Ted Denato have is Ted Denato.
Uh,
I'll,
sorry,

134
00:07:54.921 --> 00:07:56.360
Ryan did not have one.
I'm sorry.

135
00:07:56.361 --> 00:08:00.950
I'm old son of Ted Denato came up with the Bruins.
His first frigging game.

136
00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:06.080
He scored a goal and had two assists in a,
a overtime loss.

137
00:08:06.110 --> 00:08:09.550
I believe it's five to four against Columbus was great.
What's his face?

138
00:08:09.551 --> 00:08:11.300
A Bertia Ron was saying that he actually,

139
00:08:11.301 --> 00:08:16.301
when he was 18 played with Ryan's dad and Ryan was just a kid and would come to

140
00:08:17.421 --> 00:08:20.900
practice and would skate around as a little kid and now all of a sudden he's on

141
00:08:20.901 --> 00:08:23.480
the team.
Um,

142
00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:27.080
I think they said Burger wants 32 years old.
Yeah,
right around that age.

143
00:08:27.081 --> 00:08:30.590
That's when that type of shit starts happening.
You know what I mean?

144
00:08:30.830 --> 00:08:31.640
And it's like,

145
00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:36.530
you just remember somebody being like four years old and next thing you know,

146
00:08:36.531 --> 00:08:39.710
you wake up and you're doing like Tequila shots with that little fucking four

147
00:08:39.711 --> 00:08:41.840
year old being like,
how are you of age?

148
00:08:43.010 --> 00:08:46.250
When did you turn 21 and the person will be like four years ago.
And you're like,

149
00:08:46.450 --> 00:08:51.230
you're 25.
Yeah,
I got a kid.
He like,
what the,
what the fuck happened?

150
00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:56.190
And what happened was,
is you stop growing.
There's no more

151
00:08:56.190 --> 00:09:00.750
<v 2>grades,
erotic college.
Once you pass 22,
all right,</v>

152
00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:04.710
that's this weird fucking phase until you get,

153
00:09:04.711 --> 00:09:06.930
until you get married and have a kid at your own.

154
00:09:08.190 --> 00:09:11.280
If you Jiffy of like me and you just went all the way into your forties and

155
00:09:11.281 --> 00:09:15.300
never got fucking married and never had a kid,
um,

156
00:09:16.250 --> 00:09:19.620
do you live in like this fucking Peter Pan Lifestyle where you like,

157
00:09:20.950 --> 00:09:25.410
you still acting like you're 23 and then all of a sudden someone who was too is

158
00:09:25.411 --> 00:09:28.520
now 25 and they were actually married and they have a kid and you like,
what,

159
00:09:28.521 --> 00:09:33.260
what the fuck?
What am I doing?
And um,

160
00:09:33.270 --> 00:09:37.110
if you're like me,
it just causes you to drink more.
I mean,

161
00:09:37.111 --> 00:09:38.640
why would you sit there and like,
you know,

162
00:09:38.641 --> 00:09:42.930
as an adult and try to address just exactly what the fuck are you doing with

163
00:09:42.931 --> 00:09:46.110
your life?
Um,
you know,
but it's fun.

164
00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:49.880
It's fun staying out there for 15 years longer than you should have.

165
00:09:51.030 --> 00:09:54.300
Stick all the stories you have.
Maybe that's why that pleasant music bothers me.

166
00:09:54.540 --> 00:09:58.470
Maybe those people who make those,
those cooking videos,

167
00:09:58.471 --> 00:10:02.460
maybe they got married and like 25 when they were quote supposed to,

168
00:10:03.910 --> 00:10:06.400
<v 1>you know,
so they didn't,
you know,
they just stay out there too long.</v>

169
00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:11.940
Get all fucking jaded laying on like uncle freckles here.
Right.

213
00:13:12.220 --> 00:13:14.470
maybe he's still owe a third show at it.
Sorry.

214
00:13:14.530 --> 00:13:18.280
Why am I making fun of John Denver?
I always liked that guy.

215
00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:22.210
He was always great on the muppet show.
You know,
it's not an easy show.

216
00:13:22.211 --> 00:13:26.650
Everybody says don't perform with kids or animals.
What about puppets?
You know,

217
00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:29.073
I was always a tough one.

218
00:13:29.140 --> 00:13:31.690
He could fucking just sit in there talking to a goddamn puppet,
right?

219
00:13:32.110 --> 00:13:34.630
The TV screens on you and the puppet and then you're just,

220
00:13:34.631 --> 00:13:37.870
you're sitting there and you're looking down.
You can see the puppeteer.

221
00:13:38.630 --> 00:13:39.820
He's up there doing the fuck.

222
00:13:39.821 --> 00:13:42.100
He's down there doing the voice and the whole time you're trying to remember

223
00:13:42.101 --> 00:13:46.000
your lines.
You like,
that's what the guy who does fucking Fozzie bear looks like.

224
00:13:47.690 --> 00:13:51.340
So fucking weird.
I never pictured picture.
I'm looking like that,

225
00:13:52.390 --> 00:13:55.690
John.
If it's your line,
this is the 12th take.

226
00:13:55.720 --> 00:13:59.080
Can you get through the fucking take care?
Um,
anyways,

227
00:13:59.230 --> 00:14:04.230
I want to thank everybody who's been coming out all right and buying tickets to

228
00:14:04.331 --> 00:14:07.180
my show.
I'm turning a half a century old.

229
00:14:08.410 --> 00:14:11.620
You understand that everything on me is 50 years old.

230
00:14:13.510 --> 00:14:16.390
It's incredible.
By my am I,

231
00:14:16.990 --> 00:14:21.550
this whole fucking mess of a human being is somehow survived for 50 years.

232
00:14:22.570 --> 00:14:26.680
Hey Bill.
Hey Bill.
His to 50 more is to 50 more.
Uh,
do you know how to do math,

233
00:14:26.681 --> 00:14:29.800
sir?
Hey,
people do that.
Hey,

234
00:14:30.010 --> 00:14:34.900
he's do another 68 to another 60.
That would make them one 20.
This couple,

235
00:14:35.350 --> 00:14:38.470
you know the odds of one of them making it there is astronomical.

236
00:14:38.471 --> 00:14:41.230
Forget about both of them.
He's doing another 60.

237
00:14:41.231 --> 00:14:44.800
When you say that what you're really doing in a passive aggressive way is

238
00:14:44.801 --> 00:14:47.560
letting people know that they're on,
they're on the back nine,

239
00:14:47.590 --> 00:14:52.010
they're going to die.
They bill.
Here's to another 50.
I mean,

240
00:14:52.011 --> 00:14:54.350
I guess I could make a hundred.
I mean,

241
00:14:54.380 --> 00:14:56.480
what's the World gonna look like at that point?
Huh?

242
00:14:57.460 --> 00:14:59.720
A bunch of robots fucking telling me what to do.

243
00:15:02.620 --> 00:15:03.880
They could have no sympathy for me.

244
00:15:04.180 --> 00:15:07.360
You think people don't respect human beings in this country.

245
00:15:07.361 --> 00:15:10.390
Don't respect their elders.
You wait to the robots come around.

246
00:15:12.550 --> 00:15:15.760
Metal Container.
All right.
Uh,

248
00:15:21.540 --> 00:15:23.530
All right.
I love my book.
You know why?

249
00:15:23.740 --> 00:15:25.870
Cause they're not ashamed that they're a bookie.

250
00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:30.400
Unlike those other people who I know who that all those people dreamweaver's

251
00:15:30.430 --> 00:15:33.880
whatever the fuck they call and try to say,
oh,
it's a game of skill.
No,
it isn't.

252
00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:38.140
You're taking your hard earned money and you let it fucking ride and you're

253

255
00:15:46.060 --> 00:15:49.000
He is not afraid to let you know that they're,
they're a part of that world.

256
00:15:49.210 --> 00:15:52.300

259
00:15:59.231 --> 00:16:02.470

00:17:37.411 --> 00:17:40.800
you're going to fucking spend you money.
Um,
I've got 500 bucks to play with.

288
00:17:40.801 --> 00:17:43.350
I believe.
Once you guys pick me some winners,

289
00:17:43.620 --> 00:17:46.470
I'm going to put some money on the Kansas Jayhawks.
That's always been my team.

290
00:17:46.740 --> 00:17:50.010
I really got into college hoops in the 90s,
and I just Kansas

291
00:17:50.610 --> 00:17:54.600
<v 2>and um,
let's say I've always stuck with me.
I just fucking,
I just think it's,</v>

292
00:17:55.680 --> 00:17:58.110
I don't know.
I just always liked the Jayhawks.
All right.

293
00:17:58.111 --> 00:18:03.111
Trump moves to crack down on China trade with $50 billion into to,

294
00:18:03.650 --> 00:18:07.020
we have like the Christopher Walken pauses,
the weird pauses,

295
00:18:07.950 --> 00:18:10.860
drop moves to crack down on China.
Tried.

296
00:18:11.670 --> 00:18:15.270
I can't do walking with 50% tariffs on imported products.

297
00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:17.313
<v 4>Okay.</v>

298
00:18:17.380 --> 00:18:17.410
<v 2>Um,</v>

299
00:18:17.410 --> 00:18:21.940
he's basically imposing this tariff evidently because in the past he's claiming

300
00:18:22.020 --> 00:18:23.800
a China forced,

301
00:18:25.460 --> 00:18:29.600
I guess the u s to sh to show them how we make shit.

302
00:18:33.650 --> 00:18:38.090
I don't know if this is true,
but you know,
everybody steals,
right?

303
00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:41.630
Everybody steals,
um,

304
00:18:42.590 --> 00:18:46.130
you know,
like,
it's like,
hey,
Pepsi,
where'd you get that idea?

305
00:18:47.420 --> 00:18:51.440
Hey,
for stripe,
Adidas,
what's up with that sneaker?
Nice design.

306
00:18:51.441 --> 00:18:55.370
Doesn't that look familiar?
Does in that look familiar?

307
00:18:57.780 --> 00:18:58.950
Let me read this article here.

308
00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:01.470
Let me read out loud to give you an x even more enjoyment here.

309
00:19:01.471 --> 00:19:06.210
President Trump took his first steps towards imposing tariffs on 50 billion in

310
00:19:06.211 --> 00:19:11.130
Chinese goods and limiting China's ability to invest in the u s technology

311
00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:13.380
technology industry.
Now I have the hiccups.

312
00:19:15.210 --> 00:19:18.480
I'm going to plow through the hiccups holding my breath.

313
00:19:19.830 --> 00:19:24.270
Is there a way to scare yourself?
You know,
you scare yourself out of the hiccups.

314
00:19:24.271 --> 00:19:28.860
Don't look at yourself in the mirror until the next time you get hiccups and

315
00:19:28.861 --> 00:19:30.690
just that small amount of time,

316
00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:34.830
the amount that you've aged will scare the shit out of you.
All right?
Maybe not.

317
00:19:34.890 --> 00:19:36.860
All right to invest in us.

318
00:19:36.870 --> 00:19:41.220
Technology technol technology industry Thursday saying the moves were response

319
00:19:41.221 --> 00:19:45.990
to Beijing's history of forcing US companies to surrender their trade secrets to

320
00:19:45.991 --> 00:19:47.250
do business in China.

321
00:19:48.060 --> 00:19:51.650
A one to four can sell that a you gotta show us on you mate.

322
00:19:53.320 --> 00:19:56.860
It's Kentucky Fried Chicken.
Do they have the fucking secret recipe?
Now

323
00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:02.980
what do they have?
Kung Pao fried chicken.
How do they do it?

324
00:20:02.981 --> 00:20:06.610
That's like their McDonald's.
Oh my God.

325
00:20:06.611 --> 00:20:11.140
That's fucking hilarious.
Let me ask you this.

326
00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:14.710
Why is why,
if this is true,
right,

327
00:20:14.740 --> 00:20:19.150
why the fuck is Trump blaming China?
What does he blame?

328
00:20:19.151 --> 00:20:23.890
All those fucking cooperation's sell outs.
Who turned over there?
Fucking secrets.

329
00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:30.970
That's the corporation's fault.
Why don't you draw a line in the sand?

330
00:20:30.971 --> 00:20:34.860
You fucking greedy cuts.
Hey,
if you want to sell that,
he goes,

331
00:20:34.870 --> 00:20:37.330
show me how you make it.
You know what?
Go Fuck Yourself.

332
00:20:37.870 --> 00:20:41.530
I remember when I used to sell shit at theaters and if they wanted to pick them

333
00:20:41.531 --> 00:20:44.260
when they started,
like all of a sudden they'd be like,
Hey,
well you know,

334
00:20:44.390 --> 00:20:49.060
you kind of use in our theaters as a,
as a store and then they would take,

335
00:20:49.061 --> 00:20:52.640
try to take 10% 20% then in one place it went up to like 30% I was like,
yeah,

336
00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:57.190
I'm gonna give you a fucking a third of this.
Go Fuck Yourself.
I'm not doing it.

337
00:20:57.280 --> 00:20:58.600
Then I just stopped.
I stopped selling shit.

338
00:20:58.601 --> 00:21:01.180
That's why I don't go out there anymore.
All right.

339
00:21:01.210 --> 00:21:05.410
Although I am selling a poster on this tour,
I'm full of Shit.
Ah.

340
00:21:05.411 --> 00:21:08.260
The president directed US Trade Representative Robert.

341
00:21:08.620 --> 00:21:12.370
He lightened Heizer Jesus Christ

342
00:21:12.460 --> 00:21:14.170
is he the great grandson of Robert E.
Lee.

343
00:21:14.650 --> 00:21:18.850
They changed the last name to announce a proposed list of products to be hit

344
00:21:18.851 --> 00:21:23.590
with tariff increases within 15 days after a public comment period.

345
00:21:23.591 --> 00:21:28.591
The final list is designed to target Chinese products that benefit from improper

346
00:21:28.721 --> 00:21:31.270
access to us.
Technology will be made public.

347
00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:36.100
The end objective of this is to get China to modify its unfair trade practices.

348
00:21:36.460 --> 00:21:39.870
Says
Everett s e stat,

349
00:21:39.900 --> 00:21:43.440
deputy assistant to the president for international economic affairs.
Well,

350
00:21:43.441 --> 00:21:45.960
why don't they tell the fucking corporations to be,
you know,

351
00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:51.310
to fucking have a little backbone,
you know,

352
00:21:51.670 --> 00:21:54.370
get together and be like,
Hey China,
you know,
you,
you,
you wanna,

353
00:21:54.371 --> 00:21:57.010
you wanna you wanna fucking sell these hacky sex.

354
00:21:58.190 --> 00:21:59.270
We're not going to tell y'all we make them.

355
00:21:59.860 --> 00:22:02.510
You want to cut it up and try to figure it out.
That's on you.

356
00:22:02.810 --> 00:22:03.860
What am I going to sit here and tell you?

357
00:22:05.030 --> 00:22:05.863
<v 4>Okay.</v>

358
00:22:07.650 --> 00:22:10.750
<v 2>I don't know.
Who knows?
Has he met with that guy from Korea yet?</v>

359
00:22:10.751 --> 00:22:12.070
I was so excited about that.

360
00:22:12.670 --> 00:22:15.590
The two fucking world leaders that didn't get along with each other and sit
down,

361
00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:20.400
talk it out.
You know,
high some food.
Fight him over.

362
00:22:21.660 --> 00:22:24.270
I'm come over here.
Show him a good time.
Take them on space mountain.

363
00:22:24.300 --> 00:22:27.570
Then left memories.
There'll be a guy,
I can't blow that up.
I had a good time.

364
00:22:27.571 --> 00:22:30.840
I met fucking Donald Duck,
went on space mountain.

365
00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:36.060
You know,
I I gotta I gotta fucking hand job on and ah,
that,

366
00:22:36.061 --> 00:22:38.640
that fucking pirates of Penzance ride,
whatever the hell it is.

367
00:22:38.700 --> 00:22:43.410
The Johnny Depp One.
Um,
I don't know.

368
00:22:43.740 --> 00:22:46.020
I look forward to,
I understand it.
You know,

369
00:22:46.021 --> 00:22:50.100
I've been sending everybody that fucking Michael McDonald does iron maiden and

370
00:22:50.270 --> 00:22:53.670
your kills me.
The amount of people that don't get it,
they like,

371
00:22:53.671 --> 00:22:56.320
does he always sing like that?
Above?
They don't get,
it's like the,

372
00:22:56.340 --> 00:23:00.000
you have to know iron maid and Michael McDonald.

373
00:23:00.780 --> 00:23:03.570
Do you understand?
That's a wide berth.

374
00:23:05.010 --> 00:23:10.010
If you listened to ward off to and the cursive went on

375
00:23:12.220 --> 00:23:16.340
the bed,
he wished he died.
I mean the odds,

376
00:23:17.370 --> 00:23:17.750
<v 4>okay.</v>

377
00:23:17.750 --> 00:23:20.960
<v 2>For as much as people on social media always try to say that they have,</v>

378
00:23:20.961 --> 00:23:24.910
I have an eclectic,
yeah.
ECLECTIC taste in music.

379
00:23:24.911 --> 00:23:26.170
Do you member that on my space?

380
00:23:26.500 --> 00:23:30.340
One person said that and then all of a sudden everybody was using that.

381
00:23:30.341 --> 00:23:34.660
I have very eclectic taste.
It was just as fucking,
yeah.
Why?
You know,

382
00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:36.401
it's deliberate,

383
00:23:36.401 --> 00:23:39.730
carefully planned out way to show how fucking interesting you are.

384
00:23:40.470 --> 00:23:44.370
And Open minded.
Right?
Favorite albums,
uh,

385
00:23:44.620 --> 00:23:48.560
back black and muppets take Manhattan.
I mean,

386
00:23:48.620 --> 00:23:53.060
I'm all over the map.
Okay.
I don't see color man.

387
00:23:54.690 --> 00:23:55.190
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

388
00:23:55.190 --> 00:23:56.870
<v 2>Yeah.
I actually think that social media,</v>

389
00:23:57.020 --> 00:24:02.020
as much as it's helped me go from the obscurities of featuring in comedy clubs

390
00:24:04.490 --> 00:24:08.690
to the heights of telling my shit jokes in three different continents at this

391
00:24:08.691 --> 00:24:13.170
point,
um,
I actually still think it's a bad thing.

392
00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:19.620
All right.
Because it,
before social media,
nobody said Freebie,

393
00:24:20.040 --> 00:24:23.850
they will weigh less fake tits.
Um,

394
00:24:24.540 --> 00:24:27.600
speaking of which by the,
I can't,
I can't even figure out fucking Instagram.

395
00:24:28.320 --> 00:24:33.270
I finally,
I posted a picture today and then I had to delete it because I,

396
00:24:33.271 --> 00:24:36.570
I thought like the next screen was going to be the thing where you write shit.

397
00:24:37.050 --> 00:24:40.620
So my wife tells me,
kill you got to delete it.
So I deleted and then I fucking,

398
00:24:42.180 --> 00:24:43.440
um,
oh.
And then all those filters,

399
00:24:43.441 --> 00:24:45.390
what filter am I going to put on this fucking thing?

400
00:24:45.570 --> 00:24:47.610
And it actually makes you look better than you are.

401
00:24:47.790 --> 00:24:50.010
You should see how green in Austin my shirt looks.

402
00:24:50.280 --> 00:24:52.380
It looks like fucking pea soup in real life.

403
00:24:52.381 --> 00:24:56.840
But in that one it looked it look rich and bold.
Patriotic.

404
00:24:58.260 --> 00:25:01.050
The whole fucking thing is a lie.
But I'll tell you what is an ally.

405
00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:02.610
The picture that I took

406
00:25:04.110 --> 00:25:06.640
all right with Henry Winkler,

407
00:25:08.830 --> 00:25:13.420
Stephen Root and Alec Berg and uh,
Bill Hader was supposed to be there.

408
00:25:13.930 --> 00:25:18.930
We were a at nerd melt on sunset and they were promoting this incredible new

409
00:25:20.591 --> 00:25:23.890
show that is debuting this Sunday,
March 25th,

410
00:25:23.891 --> 00:25:28.780
I believe at eight o'clock eastern time.
And um,

411
00:25:30.070 --> 00:25:33.210
name of the show's Barry's about this Guy Barry.
He's an f.
Yeah,

412
00:25:33.290 --> 00:25:35.230
he's a veteran from the Afghani war.

413
00:25:36.310 --> 00:25:39.610
And when he comes back to the states,
he becomes a hit man.

414
00:25:40.900 --> 00:25:44.650
And one of his hits is in La.
He goes out to la and it's a long story.

415
00:25:44.651 --> 00:25:49.651
He ended up catching the acting bug and he's trying to transition out of

416
00:25:51.410 --> 00:25:53.510
being a hitman and becoming an actor.

417
00:25:53.540 --> 00:25:56.870
And I can't even tell you how far in such a dark comedy,

418
00:25:57.590 --> 00:26:00.710
it's such a funny fucking show.
I cannot recommend this show enough.

419
00:26:00.711 --> 00:26:03.860
They sent me four episodes.
All right.

420
00:26:04.340 --> 00:26:08.900
And I am Jonesing for the last,
for the writing,
the acting,
everything.

421
00:26:08.901 --> 00:26:12.230
You have to fucking watch this show.
You have to watch this show.
You do not.

422
00:26:12.500 --> 00:26:15.470
You come back on Monday,
you have,
you do fucking stare at the floor.

423
00:26:15.710 --> 00:26:19.610
You don't say good night to nobody.
Papa Greenwich Village.
Anybody.

424
00:26:21.020 --> 00:26:24.740
Um,
what am I?
Some kind of fucking so what bank?

425
00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:27.650
Um,
so anyways,

426
00:26:29.180 --> 00:26:29.290
<v 4>yeah,</v>

427
00:26:29.290 --> 00:26:30.670
<v 2>those three people and Bill Hader,</v>

428
00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:34.080
we're supposed to be there and I was reading up on everybody.
So,
uh,

429
00:26:34.270 --> 00:26:36.430
cause I haven't done a lot of these interview type of things.

430
00:26:36.790 --> 00:26:39.850
So I was reading up on Bill Hader and they said how um,

431
00:26:40.210 --> 00:26:43.890
one interesting fact about him,
he is the voice for the planet peanut guy,

432
00:26:44.130 --> 00:26:48.120
even though he has a peanut allergy.
So I'm sitting in the back thinking like,

433
00:26:48.121 --> 00:26:51.990
Holy Shit,
I'm going to meet Henry Winkler.

434
00:26:52.860 --> 00:26:56.970
And my goal in this hour long interview is not once am I going to bring up happy

435
00:26:56.971 --> 00:27:00.900
days or the fonts.
Right.
Steven roots there.

436
00:27:00.901 --> 00:27:03.000
I'm not bringing up that fucking red stapler.

437
00:27:03.330 --> 00:27:07.470
I know both of these guys have answered these questions 4 million fucking times.

438
00:27:07.471 --> 00:27:11.130
I want to talk about the present and how amazing this goddamn show us.

439
00:27:11.970 --> 00:27:15.900
And um,
so I'm waiting for everybody to come in at the last second,
right before,

440
00:27:15.930 --> 00:27:17.760
you know,
I'm nervous to do this interview.
I haven't,
you know,

441
00:27:17.761 --> 00:27:21.300
he's a big fucking people and a,
and Alec Berg worked,

442
00:27:21.301 --> 00:27:25.110
worked on like two of my favorite shows,
um,

443
00:27:25.380 --> 00:27:27.930
Caribbean throughZ ASM and silicone valley,

444
00:27:28.530 --> 00:27:31.890
both high high level comedies.
And I was,
you know,
like I said,

445
00:27:31.891 --> 00:27:35.370
a little intimidated to meet all these people and right before I'm going to go

446
00:27:35.371 --> 00:27:38.910
out there,
they show up and they say bill Hader can't make it.

447
00:27:40.350 --> 00:27:42.510
He,
uh,
somebody put some peanuts,

448
00:27:42.511 --> 00:27:47.511
shit like some Allman milk and he's fucking Starbucks coffee and his throat was

449
00:27:47.641 --> 00:27:52.140
swollen up.
He's fine.
The man is fine.
Um,
so now I'm sitting there like,

450
00:27:52.170 --> 00:27:53.003
oh fuck.

451
00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:58.350
Like I had so many questions to ask him and I'm not talking to Henry Winkler a

452
00:27:58.350 --> 00:28:00.720
bout happy days or Stephen Rude about the red staple.

453
00:28:00.750 --> 00:28:04.740
What the fuck am I going to do?
And fortunately there was such great guests.

454
00:28:04.741 --> 00:28:09.150
They actually sort of carried me,
was on Sirius Xm and they was,

455
00:28:09.210 --> 00:28:13.860
um,
I learned so much about acting and writing,
just talking to them.

456
00:28:15.500 --> 00:28:20.160
Um,
the through line with the three of them and just how open they were.
And um,

457
00:28:20.190 --> 00:28:24.720
Henry Winkler has this,
this,
this combination that I've never seen.

458
00:28:25.260 --> 00:28:27.630
I don't think I've ever seen it.
He's like the warmest,

459
00:28:27.690 --> 00:28:31.770
nicest guy while being unbelievably driven

460
00:28:33.360 --> 00:28:38.070
and just has giant balls as far as like ego in there,

461
00:28:38.071 --> 00:28:41.250
you make you fucking choices.
There is no wrong choice.

462
00:28:41.990 --> 00:28:45.330
I don't give a fuck if this choice acting choices going to make me look stupid.

463
00:28:45.331 --> 00:28:48.660
I'm totally committed to it.
Usually people like that,

464
00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:51.840
that driven with that much courage and all of that,

465
00:28:51.841 --> 00:28:56.250
like literally they can be really a abrasive when you meet him,

466
00:28:57.480 --> 00:29:01.740
you know,
that just push and passion.
He's like the nicest fucking guy ever.

467
00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:06.510
And listening to him talking about the like and the fact that he went in any

468
00:29:06.511 --> 00:29:08.970
audition for it and all of that,
he wasn't sitting there going,
hey,

469
00:29:08.971 --> 00:29:11.670
I'm a fucking TV legend.
You should be happy to get me.

470
00:29:11.671 --> 00:29:14.460
He went in and auditioned for Steven Roots.
Another guy,

471
00:29:14.790 --> 00:29:19.380
same thing talking about you go in,
you fucking audition,
you know,

472
00:29:19.381 --> 00:29:22.530
and I was getting advice,
you know,
from other people going,
hey man,

473
00:29:22.531 --> 00:29:25.620
you're at a certain,
once you were at a certain level you don't go in and read,

474
00:29:26.220 --> 00:29:28.890
you know,
you should be getting offers like that fucking Hollywood shit.

475
00:29:28.891 --> 00:29:31.500
And I talked to two of them.
You don't get better than those two guys.

476
00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:35.100
And they both told me if you want the part you go in and read for it.

477
00:29:35.370 --> 00:29:36.270
And I was just like,

478
00:29:36.271 --> 00:29:39.780
there is a fucking gem right there then I'm never going to forget.

479
00:29:40.140 --> 00:29:42.100
So thank you to the of them for telling me that.

480
00:29:42.550 --> 00:29:46.390
And then Alec was talking about um,
writing,

481
00:29:46.391 --> 00:29:49.540
which was fascinating to me because I've gotten to do it for the last three

482
00:29:49.541 --> 00:29:54.220
seasons on f is for family.
And uh,
up untilF is for family,

483
00:29:54.221 --> 00:29:57.430
I always wrote for myself.
So I heard it,

484
00:29:57.431 --> 00:29:59.560
I wrote it and then I set it the way I heard it.

485
00:30:00.010 --> 00:30:02.080
And then all of a sudden onF is for family.

486
00:30:02.380 --> 00:30:05.920
I hear it a certain way and then we go to the table read and an actor does it

487
00:30:05.950 --> 00:30:10.330
another way and there's a thing where you gotta be like,

488
00:30:12.190 --> 00:30:14.310
he can't be like that asshole going like,
oh wait,

489
00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:18.120
you're supposed to clear your throat first and do it exactly the way I hear it.

490
00:30:18.121 --> 00:30:21.640
You have to have that thing where you just have to be open to the way they do
it.

491
00:30:21.641 --> 00:30:25.530
And thank God.
Thank God.
I,

492
00:30:25.531 --> 00:30:27.510
I think I kind of figured that out.

493
00:30:28.650 --> 00:30:31.440
Certainly with the fucking actors that we got on an F is for family.

494
00:30:31.441 --> 00:30:35.040
It's like I'm not going to tell these people to do anything any other way than

495
00:30:35.070 --> 00:30:39.460
the way they're doing it.
Um,
but just the way Alec,
I hope you guys get,

496
00:30:39.470 --> 00:30:40.650
I don't know.
I don't know how it works.

497
00:30:40.860 --> 00:30:44.760
If you could go on Sirius Xm and downloaded the interview,

498
00:30:44.761 --> 00:30:46.170
it seems like everything you didn't,
you didn't,

499
00:30:46.171 --> 00:30:49.980
you didn't have a miss anything anymore because it's still available.
But,
um,

500
00:30:50.610 --> 00:30:55.590
long story short with all this meandering is that show comes out this Sunday and

501
00:30:55.590 --> 00:30:59.280
,
uh,
Bill Hader soon.
All this like,
you know,

502
00:30:59.281 --> 00:31:04.281
it's not just a straight up comedy like it's a really like dramatic dark show.

503
00:31:06.160 --> 00:31:08.250
It's,
I dunno,

504
00:31:08.251 --> 00:31:12.540
it Kinda has everything that I love and it reminded me of one of my favorite

505
00:31:12.541 --> 00:31:15.840
comedies.
I mentioned this a zillion times.
It's like midnight run.

506
00:31:15.841 --> 00:31:20.841
And I just loved that movie because like it's crazy as it got,

507
00:31:21.691 --> 00:31:25.530
everything was still rooted in a reality and it had a lot of heart and all of

508
00:31:25.531 --> 00:31:28.410
that type of stuff.
And I,
and this show has that,
I'm telling you,

509
00:31:28.411 --> 00:31:29.370

It's Belper and this is the Monday morning podcast and the levels are a little

526
00:33:08.231 --> 00:33:12.910
too high.
Let me bring it down.
Bring it down for you.

527
00:33:12.911 --> 00:33:16.260
Model for calls.
Hey,
how are you?
It's uh,

528
00:33:16.300 --> 00:33:20.260
March 25th a Thursday.
And I know what you're thinking.

529
00:33:20.261 --> 00:33:24.010
Where the fuck was the podcast?
Um,

530
00:33:24.011 --> 00:33:27.940
on the 22nd I was in Europe and I brought my recorder,
but I've got the wire.

531
00:33:29.080 --> 00:33:33.010
Um,
yeah,
so I fucked up.
But you know what?
We're going to get through this.

532
00:33:34.150 --> 00:33:37.210
My 14 listeners that I'm back down to over this,

533
00:33:37.240 --> 00:33:42.220
this rough seven week fucking period as I try to get this thing back up and

534
00:33:42.221 --> 00:33:43.750
running again.
Um,

535
00:33:43.751 --> 00:33:47.460
I do have a new web guy and um,

536
00:33:47.560 --> 00:33:52.540
he is sense uploaded all of the podcasts from the beginning of time,

537
00:33:52.690 --> 00:33:57.280
which is a time began as far as I'm concerned in my podcast.

538
00:33:57.280 --> 00:34:01.930
Religion began in June of 2007.
All right.

539
00:34:01.960 --> 00:34:06.490
With one of my apostles,
Robert Kelly setting it up in his apartment.

540
00:34:06.491 --> 00:34:09.910
So all the podcasts is what we're working on right now.
Okay.
And all you guys,

541
00:34:09.911 --> 00:34:13.620
you send me emails and everything and trashing me and shit and uh,

542
00:34:13.630 --> 00:34:17.600
I actually appreciate the trashing because that means you care.
All right?

543
00:34:17.710 --> 00:34:22.090
So don't worry.
Actually,
by the time you fucking listening to this thing,

544
00:34:22.091 --> 00:34:26.350
when you actually find it,
the problem is over.
Okay.
Uh,

545
00:34:26.680 --> 00:34:30.610
but for those of you who are actually in the bunker and have been able to find

546
00:34:30.611 --> 00:34:34.780
this fucking podcast,
um,
basically,
uh,

547
00:34:35.740 --> 00:34:37.630
we're going to have it all up on iTunes right now.

548
00:34:37.631 --> 00:34:41.140
I have like three different icons or whatever the fuck you spoke,
apps,

549
00:34:41.141 --> 00:34:43.390
whatever the hell you call them,
use that you can click on.

550
00:34:43.630 --> 00:34:46.870
One is the old school podcast with [inaudible].

551
00:34:46.900 --> 00:34:51.700
The other one is the one that I did on Libsyn for like fucking three weeks and I

552
00:34:51.701 --> 00:34:55.630
hated that.
And now I have my new one that I created.
I didn't create,

553
00:34:55.631 --> 00:34:59.320
I paid someone to create it.
CLC,
the white man does,
takes credit.

554
00:35:00.880 --> 00:35:02.110
Um,
anyways,
um,

555
00:35:02.860 --> 00:35:06.760
that I paid for someone else to create that I will now take the credit for and

556
00:35:06.761 --> 00:35:11.590
banish the person who created it to some terrible duty like they do in the

557
00:35:11.591 --> 00:35:15.250
police.
Um,
and I'll take all credit for it,

558
00:35:15.251 --> 00:35:17.590
but there's going to be one icon.
Okay.

559
00:35:17.591 --> 00:35:20.500
This is what we're working towards and it's taken a while because we had to

560
00:35:20.501 --> 00:35:23.770
upload a couple of fucking years worth of podcasts and a,

561
00:35:23.810 --> 00:35:27.880
it's all going to be on one icon and you're going to click on,

562
00:35:27.881 --> 00:35:30.280
it's going to be the Monday morning podcast,
um,

563
00:35:30.460 --> 00:35:33.400
from right now all the way back to the beginning of time.

564
00:35:34.030 --> 00:35:37.860
And I'm slowly starting my own religion because,
uh,

565
00:35:38.700 --> 00:35:41.580
those guys,
they don't get in trouble and they make a ton of money.
You know,

566
00:35:41.581 --> 00:35:46.140
he fucking raped 16,000 fucking kids and uh,
you know,

567
00:35:46.141 --> 00:35:49.230
no one's going to jail as far as I know,
maybe a couple of people are.

568
00:35:49.320 --> 00:35:53.580
I don't really,
you know,
I didn't really follow the story.
You know,

569
00:35:53.581 --> 00:35:57.030
I just heard people talking about it last night at the Improv and then I fucking

570
00:35:57.210 --> 00:36:01.530
threw my 2 cents in to the ad to the misinformation.
But anyways,

571
00:36:01.531 --> 00:36:04.680
all this shit is going to be a,
it's all going to be under one umbrella,

572
00:36:04.681 --> 00:36:05.760
so it'll be nice and easy,

573
00:36:05.970 --> 00:36:09.330
big stupid picture of myself and we'll be back to normal.
Okay.

574
00:36:09.480 --> 00:36:14.160
We had a little blip and I relationship.
Okay.
You know,

575
00:36:14.220 --> 00:36:15.900
that happens in all relationships.
You know,

576
00:36:15.901 --> 00:36:18.600
every once in a while for a couple of weeks,
maybe you move out,

577
00:36:19.620 --> 00:36:22.260
get your head straight,
and it'd be sleep on the couch a couple of nights.

578
00:36:22.260 --> 00:36:26.410
That's what's going on here.
Nothing else.
All right.
I haven't quit doing them.

579
00:36:26.480 --> 00:36:27.070
But you know,
you know,

580
00:36:27.070 --> 00:36:30.690
the one thing that has remained constant is I have been continuing to do the

581
00:36:30.691 --> 00:36:33.300
podcast granted,
you know,
two,

582
00:36:33.301 --> 00:36:38.160
three weeks to three days late on this one when I was over in Scotland,

583
00:36:39.090 --> 00:36:43.830
Doh balloon and London,
London,
England.
And um,

584
00:36:44.520 --> 00:36:48.240
but before I get into all of that,
I'm a fan of the podcast,

585
00:36:48.241 --> 00:36:52.650
actually started a podcast page where you guys can go on there and look at some

586
00:36:52.651 --> 00:36:57.651
of my obscure references or look at the words that I mispronounce or whatever

587
00:36:58.141 --> 00:37:01.410
else.
I'm actually putting some questions on there that I want you guys to start

588
00:37:01.411 --> 00:37:05.730
answering and I'll read them here in the podcast.
What's the name of the site?

589
00:37:05.760 --> 00:37:09.210
Good fucking question.
I don't have it in front of me.
I'm winging it this week.

590
00:37:09.480 --> 00:37:13.200
It's a m M podcast.com I believe.

591
00:37:13.680 --> 00:37:18.230
Let me actually do this right now.
So I know I'm really gonna wing this one.
Uh,

592
00:37:18.240 --> 00:37:19.440
this is all going to be off.

593
00:37:19.441 --> 00:37:24.120
The top of me had a Christ that is even coming up and men podcast.

594
00:37:25.170 --> 00:37:29.880
So what the fuck it is?
Hang on,
I'm typing with my middle finger.
Enter.

595
00:37:30.390 --> 00:37:34.020
What do we got?
You fucking cunt.
That isn't it.

596
00:37:34.800 --> 00:37:39.440
How about the
Oh,

597
00:37:39.450 --> 00:37:42.360
you suck.
You know what?
I'm the fucking worst.

598
00:37:42.750 --> 00:37:46.170
Is it really that bad that people can't find this fucking podcast when I can't

599
00:37:46.171 --> 00:37:50.760
even have the fucking decency to be three days late and actually be prepared?

600
00:37:52.710 --> 00:37:56.610
That's what it is.
I got in,
I found it,
uh,

601
00:37:57.150 --> 00:37:59.730
and I spelled it wrong.
It's,
it's,
this is,
this is the fan page.

602
00:37:59.731 --> 00:38:04.470
It's the MM podcast.com.
That's what you want to go to.

603
00:38:04.890 --> 00:38:08.640
And then you click it on and there's a picture of me and my fucking shaved head

604
00:38:09.210 --> 00:38:13.170
and a big fucking picture of big foot.
Um,

605
00:38:13.200 --> 00:38:16.080
and then you scroll down and they got all this shit that I'm,

606
00:38:16.620 --> 00:38:18.750
that I've been talking about,
um,

607
00:38:18.780 --> 00:38:21.270
on here and it's just going to keep getting bigger and bigger.

608
00:38:21.271 --> 00:38:22.500
That's what we're hoping for.

609
00:38:23.020 --> 00:38:26.250
Gives you something else to do rather than be it you fucking job hating your

610
00:38:26.251 --> 00:38:29.100
life.
And that's what this podcast is all about.

611
00:38:29.101 --> 00:38:33.210
It's all about getting you through that first fucking awful day of the week.

612
00:38:33.211 --> 00:38:38.211
Which is why and me of hoarding my dates out in my stuff and trying to become a

613
00:38:38.291 --> 00:38:42.820
silent millionaire.
Um,
what does the silent millionaire,

614
00:38:43.180 --> 00:38:46.390
I'll tell you what it is.
It's,
it's a fucking term that I just invented.

615
00:38:46.540 --> 00:38:51.250
What do you think about that?
You know,
I could do that on this podcast.
Oh,

616
00:38:51.251 --> 00:38:55.000
speaking of which Robert Kelly,

617
00:38:55.390 --> 00:38:58.660
one of the creators.
Other podcasts.
Hang on a second.

618
00:38:59.080 --> 00:39:00.430
Bobby Kelly.

619
00:39:02.500 --> 00:39:02.790
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

620
00:39:02.790 --> 00:39:05.460
<v 2>Not that I'm actually doing my podcast and I was talking about,</v>

621
00:39:05.461 --> 00:39:07.760
I was just talking about how you fucking,
uh,

622
00:39:08.160 --> 00:39:13.020
helped me create the thing over in your apartment back in the beginning of time.

623
00:39:15.280 --> 00:39:16.113
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

624
00:39:16.150 --> 00:39:18.100
<v 2>I'm doing it right now as we speak.
But uh,</v>

625
00:39:18.420 --> 00:39:21.310
your voices up against my ear so you're still a,
you know,

626
00:39:21.311 --> 00:39:24.820
you can talk about shit that we don't need people to know about unless you want

627
00:39:24.821 --> 00:39:27.280
to be.
Why didn't I fucking have you on any of my podcasts?

628
00:39:27.460 --> 00:39:31.860
When do you go back to New York?
Oh,

629
00:39:31.861 --> 00:39:35.460
you fucking son of a bitch with your career.
What's the deal?

630
00:39:35.550 --> 00:39:39.030
Are we going on a hike today is the gayest thing I've ever said on the podcast.

631
00:39:39.930 --> 00:39:43.500
Um,
what's the deal?

632
00:39:46.550 --> 00:39:49.620
One o'clock is good.
Let me finish running my mouth and I'll see you over there,

633
00:39:49.650 --> 00:39:50.483
right?

634
00:39:52.250 --> 00:39:52.700
<v 5>Okay.</v>

635
00:39:52.700 --> 00:39:55.370
<v 2>Bobby.
I'm doing a podcast and I'm boring people right now.</v>

636
00:39:55.400 --> 00:39:58.370
I'm going to meet you there.
All right.

637
00:39:59.330 --> 00:40:01.220
We'll go rollerblading afterwards.
Okay,

638
00:40:04.040 --> 00:40:04.940
I'll see you there at one.

639
00:40:06.690 --> 00:40:07.290
<v 5>Yeah,</v>

640
00:40:07.290 --> 00:40:11.010
<v 2>he hung up on me like he should have.
Um,
that's right.</v>

641
00:40:11.940 --> 00:40:13.530
I'm going on a hike with Robert Kelly.

642
00:40:15.660 --> 00:40:19.860
I'm bringing a fanny pack.
I don't give a fuck.
I'm going to wear a headband.

643
00:40:20.040 --> 00:40:24.240
Maybe tie a Bandana around when my pasty thighs like Chachi on happy days.

644
00:40:24.450 --> 00:40:27.840
Maybe I'll do that shit.
I don't give a fuck.
It's the west coast.

645
00:40:27.870 --> 00:40:30.360
Nobody's paying attention.
There's no reason to,

646
00:40:30.361 --> 00:40:31.650
you know why nobody pays attention.

647
00:40:31.651 --> 00:40:35.940
Do you realize we are at the end of the fucking day,
not only,

648
00:40:36.420 --> 00:40:40.620
not only in this country are we at the end of the fucking day.

649
00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:43.800
Okay.
The though the world,

650
00:40:44.850 --> 00:40:48.240
by the time we're done talking shit in a bar,

651
00:40:48.241 --> 00:40:51.660
the sun's already coming up in Japan starting the following fucking day.

652
00:40:51.661 --> 00:40:56.040
We haven't gone to bed yet.
Is it any wonder?
Everybody out here seems flaky.

653
00:40:56.190 --> 00:40:59.430
Do you know if I wake up at nine,
nine 30 out here?

654
00:40:59.550 --> 00:41:03.090
It's already mid day back east.
Yes,
Bill.
We can do the math.
Well,

655
00:41:03.091 --> 00:41:05.760
some people can't.
You know.

656
00:41:06.480 --> 00:41:10.170
So what is the fucking point of me getting up and watching the news or reading a

657
00:41:10.171 --> 00:41:11.004
newspaper?

658
00:41:11.250 --> 00:41:15.360
Because it's going to talk about yesterday and it's already fucking today and

659
00:41:15.361 --> 00:41:19.050
back east.
It's already fucking beyond halfway through the fucking day.

660
00:41:20.340 --> 00:41:24.720
That's my excuse.
Um,
so anyways,
uh,

661
00:41:24.790 --> 00:41:27.510
this is the Monday morning podcast that I'm doing here on a Thursday.

662
00:41:27.511 --> 00:41:30.300
I will be doing another one on Monday.
I'll get caught up.
All right?

663
00:41:30.301 --> 00:41:34.700
Don't get mad.
Don't act like you guys.
Don't get behind in your,
you know,

664
00:41:35.040 --> 00:41:38.120
stuff starts to mount.
You know,
you can't deal with it.

665
00:41:38.121 --> 00:41:41.210
So you take a pill and then the next day,
you know,

666
00:41:41.211 --> 00:41:43.820
maybe I'll take two pills in the next day.
You know,

667
00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:48.200
you're fucking drooling on your fucking lazy boy.
That's how it goes down.

668
00:41:48.230 --> 00:41:49.700
I don't even know what I'm going to talk about this week.

669
00:41:49.710 --> 00:41:53.960
Let's talk about my trip to Europe.
Um,
it was unbelievable.

670
00:41:54.140 --> 00:41:58.910
It was an incredible success.
Uh,

671
00:41:58.911 --> 00:42:00.760
I dunno what the fuck it was.
I don't know.
As I went over there,

672
00:42:00.761 --> 00:42:05.600
had a great time and people showed up and I had a great time.
Uh,

673
00:42:05.601 --> 00:42:10.160
the first place I went to was I went to,
um,
I went to London,

674
00:42:10.161 --> 00:42:14.860
England and uh,
I've always wanted to go there and I have to admit,
I,

675
00:42:15.110 --> 00:42:20.110
when we landed at a frau a have a sweat in here roasting,

676
00:42:22.490 --> 00:42:27.190
baking,
boiling.
It's like a sauna.
I sell mine.

677
00:42:27.380 --> 00:42:29.600
Hey Fro,
yeah.
Eight dead,

678
00:42:30.680 --> 00:42:33.590
a dead mate at Salomon [inaudible].
Sorry.

679
00:42:33.650 --> 00:42:35.730
Every time I say Heathrow I have to say heath row.

680
00:42:35.780 --> 00:42:37.670
And then I just start doing lines from sexy piece.

681
00:42:37.850 --> 00:42:42.740
Cause I love that fucking movie.
You know,
I love that movie because they,

682
00:42:42.741 --> 00:42:47.180
it's,
it's the best fucking a chick flick ever.

683
00:42:47.480 --> 00:42:50.060
I've said this before and I'll fucking say it again.
Okay.

684
00:42:50.061 --> 00:42:53.300
Next time you girls like,
that's really like a romantic movie.

685
00:42:53.301 --> 00:42:55.160
I'd like to see something,
you know,

686
00:42:56.220 --> 00:42:58.970
he just been watching too many of these action movies and it's like,

687
00:42:59.430 --> 00:43:02.520
I don't like him,
but I basically said I'm different and I kick.

688
00:43:02.530 --> 00:43:05.480
Can I pick it out?
Okay.
Can I pick it up?

689
00:43:05.600 --> 00:43:08.630
Like you didn't fucking pick out every other one.
Your fucking Twat.

690
00:43:10.700 --> 00:43:15.020
You know what?
Let me step up to the plate sweetheart.
All right.

691
00:43:15.290 --> 00:43:17.370
What'd you unbutton?
Another button on your fucking shirt.

692
00:43:17.550 --> 00:43:20.880
Give me a little excitement on the way to the fucking video store and I'll pick

693
00:43:20.881 --> 00:43:25.020
out the romantic movie and you come out with sexy beast.
Oh my God.

694
00:43:25.260 --> 00:43:29.340
Sexy scandal.
This,
this isn't like a nine and a half weeks now,
bitch.

695
00:43:29.430 --> 00:43:32.580
It's a fucking love story.
Why are you guys had to call me that?

696
00:43:32.640 --> 00:43:35.820
Because you are a bitch.
No,
sorry.
Um,

697
00:43:37.360 --> 00:43:39.590
that's a fucking great stories about our guys do just,

698
00:43:39.610 --> 00:43:43.450
he loves this woman and he has his own fucking place in the middle of nowhere

699
00:43:43.451 --> 00:43:45.980
and everything's going fucking gray basically.
Yeah.

700
00:43:46.030 --> 00:43:49.870
If you ever watch a gangster movie,
uh,
you know,

701
00:43:49.871 --> 00:43:53.260
one of the reoccurring themes to the point that now it's become cliched,

702
00:43:53.530 --> 00:43:58.240
is there's always the guy who is just going to do one more job and then he's

703
00:43:58.241 --> 00:44:02.860
getting out,
you know,
same thing in the Vietnam movies.
I got one more tour,

704
00:44:02.861 --> 00:44:07.000
dude,
I'm short.
I shouldn't be on points on,
right.

705
00:44:07.090 --> 00:44:10.330
And you know what the fuck's going to happen to them,
right?
And a,

706
00:44:10.331 --> 00:44:11.111
I even believe though,

707
00:44:11.111 --> 00:44:15.490
the Wayans brothers and one of their movies made fun of those,
those,
uh,

708
00:44:15.550 --> 00:44:18.550
those fucking around the way movies where there's the,

709
00:44:18.560 --> 00:44:22.330
the black guy kid who's going to fucking go to college,

710
00:44:23.020 --> 00:44:26.390
you know,
and he stayed strong.
He didn't get in the game.

711
00:44:26.391 --> 00:44:29.480
And then he walks up and he's fucking eating some ice cream and he gets shot in

712
00:44:29.481 --> 00:44:33.330
an alley or some shit.
I don't know what the happens,
you know what I mean?
Um,

713
00:44:33.331 --> 00:44:33.841
so anyways,

714
00:44:33.841 --> 00:44:38.730
this movie actually is about a couple of guys who succeeded.

715
00:44:38.731 --> 00:44:42.240
They did their last job,
they got their money,

716
00:44:42.270 --> 00:44:45.810
and they got out of the fucking game and they live in,
in Spain.

717
00:44:46.350 --> 00:44:49.940
They're married to a couple of hot fucking Bra was,

718
00:44:50.700 --> 00:44:54.270
and uh,
they don't have any kids,
so it's great.

719
00:44:54.360 --> 00:44:56.850
And you know what you're doing when you don't have any fucking kids and you're

720
00:44:56.851 --> 00:44:59.370
married to a hot rod,
you still fuck.

721
00:44:59.880 --> 00:45:03.810
And your barbecue and your lay next to your pool gun.
I,
yeah,

722
00:45:05.160 --> 00:45:05.993
I'm sweat

723
00:45:07.110 --> 00:45:10.440
roast and bake and boil it just fucking chilling out,

724
00:45:11.160 --> 00:45:15.810
having a great fucking time.
That's where the movie begins.
And then

725
00:45:17.310 --> 00:45:21.870
trouble ensues go fucking rented.
I love that goddamn movie.
Every time I see it,

726
00:45:21.871 --> 00:45:23.760
it gets better.
So anyways,

727
00:45:23.910 --> 00:45:28.830
we landed at a fro watching telly.
Is this Stan?

728
00:45:29.910 --> 00:45:34.080
I'm sorry.
It's just getting them noxious like the rest of it isn't.

729
00:45:35.250 --> 00:45:40.080
Um,
so,
uh,
we landed at a fro and uh,
we got in a cab,
you know,

730
00:45:40.081 --> 00:45:43.090
when I started driving down the fucking other side of the road.
Okay.

731
00:45:43.490 --> 00:45:47.250
<v 6>Oh,
the stereos on the other side.
We really are in England</v>

732
00:45:47.760 --> 00:45:50.740
<v 2>and we're driving through and I'm looking at England and in London and you know</v>

733
00:45:50.741 --> 00:45:55.240
what?
I'm not liking it.
I'm like,
look at this fucking Shitty town.

734
00:45:56.740 --> 00:45:58.930
I just,
it just,
it didn't appeal to me.

735
00:45:58.960 --> 00:46:03.960
And I think the real thing was I was jet lagged cause I ended up loving it but I

736
00:46:04.061 --> 00:46:07.030
was fucking really jet lagged and uh,

737
00:46:07.820 --> 00:46:10.960
and my girlfriend's going to kill me if I tell this story.
Uh,
this is basically,

738
00:46:11.140 --> 00:46:14.110
this is basically what happened.
I got a first class ticket over there,
right?

739
00:46:14.710 --> 00:46:18.370
But it was basically from New Jersey to London,

740
00:46:18.400 --> 00:46:23.020
a fro a frau,
um,
airport.

741
00:46:23.200 --> 00:46:25.870
And this is what has happened my entire career.

742
00:46:26.830 --> 00:46:31.300
Every time I get a first class fucking ticket,
which is rare,

743
00:46:32.350 --> 00:46:34.010
I get a first class fucking 10.

744
00:46:34.011 --> 00:46:36.850
Let me answer the answer that question before you get like,
Bill,

745
00:46:36.851 --> 00:46:39.850
you at the point where you fly first class,
you ever where you go?

746
00:46:40.030 --> 00:46:43.660
Not even fucking close.
Okay.

747
00:46:44.500 --> 00:46:46.810
Most of those people that you see in Firstclass,

748
00:46:46.840 --> 00:46:50.140
they got bumped up because they fly so much because I'm going to tell you a

749
00:46:50.141 --> 00:46:54.550
fucking first class ticket is 1200 to 1500 bucks a month.

750
00:46:54.920 --> 00:46:58.900
All right?
So if I buy two of those a month,

751
00:46:59.350 --> 00:47:00.400
that's like an extra,

752
00:47:00.580 --> 00:47:05.580
it's fucking three grand on my credit card as opposed to like fucking 600 bucks,

753
00:47:06.820 --> 00:47:10.240
700 or whatever for two coach tickets.

754
00:47:10.960 --> 00:47:15.280
And you know,
that adds up.
All right times 12 months.

755
00:47:15.281 --> 00:47:17.470
That's 36 fucking grand.

756
00:47:18.620 --> 00:47:22.540
Just so you can get on the plane first and fucking stretch your legs out,
right?

757
00:47:22.570 --> 00:47:27.120
So basically the only time I fly first class is,
uh,

758
00:47:27.180 --> 00:47:30.190
is if they hooked me up.
Other than that,

759
00:47:30.191 --> 00:47:34.720
I'll fucking sit in the back with my knees against my chest.

760
00:47:34.721 --> 00:47:37.870
I don't give a shit.
I got the whole thing worked out.
This is how I do it.

761
00:47:37.960 --> 00:47:40.090
All right?
This is how I do it.

762
00:47:40.810 --> 00:47:45.810
First thing I do when I sit down is I take my wallet out of my back pocket

763
00:47:46.841 --> 00:47:50.470
because I'm one of these guys that has like nine years of business cards,

764
00:47:50.920 --> 00:47:53.230
bank receipts,
Kay.
She Shit,

765
00:47:53.290 --> 00:47:58.290
all this shit in my wallet and right off the bat is so fucked up.

766
00:47:58.450 --> 00:48:02.080
It's,
it's fucking on one ass cheek.

767
00:48:02.650 --> 00:48:07.150
So it's fucking messes up behind my back,
my alignment and a,

768
00:48:07.210 --> 00:48:09.130
if I sit on,
sit on it too hard,

769
00:48:09.131 --> 00:48:13.810
it's like sitting on a fucking stone and it makes me bum a little sensitive.

770
00:48:16.750 --> 00:48:18.250
So I take that fucker out,

771
00:48:18.370 --> 00:48:22.900
I stick it in my front pocket and then I just make sure every couple hours I get

772
00:48:22.901 --> 00:48:26.890
up,
I always get an Ilc,
which socks because people are going to crawl over you.

773
00:48:27.370 --> 00:48:28.630
But uh,
you know,

774
00:48:28.631 --> 00:48:31.530
I don't like being that guy when I got to take a leak in the person next to me

775
00:48:31.670 --> 00:48:33.670
as their laptop out and then they do,
then

776
00:48:36.220 --> 00:48:40.330
we'll fucking get a first class ticket.
You'd do shh of get an aisle seat.

777
00:48:41.220 --> 00:48:45.580
Who's your fucking travel agent?
We are sitting in the middle.
Um,
so anyways,

778
00:48:45.640 --> 00:48:50.080
I get up every couple hours and I do a little mini yoga thing down the back of

779
00:48:50.081 --> 00:48:52.450
the plane.
You know,
I just do,

780
00:48:52.451 --> 00:48:57.451
I've got this little whole stretching routine that I do because I fly so fucking

781
00:48:57.491 --> 00:48:57.970
much.

782
00:48:57.970 --> 00:49:01.750
And that's how much are first class ticket is that I would rather sit in the

783
00:49:01.751 --> 00:49:06.751
back with my wallet in my front pocket doing yoga back near the shitter.

784
00:49:07.510 --> 00:49:09.690
That's how expensive FirstClass is.
So anyways,

785
00:49:09.691 --> 00:49:14.560
so I get this first class ticket from Julie,
Josie,
Newark,

786
00:49:14.561 --> 00:49:17.620
New Jersey to uh,
to London in April,

787
00:49:17.860 --> 00:49:21.160
going to eat for health a la,
London,
England.

788
00:49:21.820 --> 00:49:25.270
And this is what has always happened whenever I've gotten a first class,

789
00:49:25.330 --> 00:49:29.800
at least half the fucking time when I'm getting,
when I'm flying first class,

790
00:49:29.801 --> 00:49:33.730
it means I'm going someplace that's awesome or the Gig is going to be awesome.

791
00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:38.260
And what always ends up happening is somebody else wants to fucking go.

792
00:49:38.830 --> 00:49:40.300
And then they always go,
dude,

793
00:49:41.020 --> 00:49:45.370
you're giving you first grade year to know who was any way.
Like you know,

794
00:49:45.790 --> 00:49:48.940
maybe you could just take a bio,

795
00:49:49.230 --> 00:49:50.830
get to fucking coach tickets.

796
00:49:52.240 --> 00:49:55.900
So basically half the times I've gotten a first class ticket,

797
00:49:55.930 --> 00:49:58.840
I haven't gotten a fly first class.
I'm sitting back there with,

798
00:49:58.900 --> 00:50:03.900
with a manager or a fucking agent or who knows what a buddy who wants to come

799
00:50:05.531 --> 00:50:08.560
along to go check out the gig because it's going to be awesome.

800
00:50:09.100 --> 00:50:10.390
So I never get to fly.

801
00:50:11.350 --> 00:50:14.770
So long story fuck in short is a,
you know,

802
00:50:14.771 --> 00:50:18.640
I spent five months on the road getting ready for,
to tape,
let it go,

803
00:50:18.641 --> 00:50:22.530
which by the way,
looks fucking awesome.
I was just looking at,

804
00:50:22.540 --> 00:50:26.670
that's my new special coming up.
So anyways,
I um,

805
00:50:29.040 --> 00:50:31.470
you know,
I,
I never get to fly first class,
so I get,
I get,

806
00:50:31.530 --> 00:50:33.540
I just totally lost my train of thought.

807
00:50:33.730 --> 00:50:38.220
So you look@oneweekoffoflumosity.com and uh,
my brain's fucking up.

808
00:50:39.770 --> 00:50:43.150
Yeah.
So this is the deal.
So I get a first class ticket to go to fucking,
uh,

809
00:50:43.190 --> 00:50:48.020
from New Jersey to London,
right a fro and uh,

810
00:50:48.080 --> 00:50:53.020
my girl goes,
I want to go.
Can I go?

811
00:50:54.080 --> 00:50:58.590
Oh,
you're going some place fun.
She only wants to go to the fun places.

812
00:50:58.600 --> 00:51:02.380
She doesn't come to like fucking,
you know,
Pittsburgh when I need her

813
00:51:04.150 --> 00:51:07.930
fucking Madison,
Wisconsin.
She doesn't want to go on those.
We'll go on a mat,

814
00:51:07.960 --> 00:51:11.770
Miami.
Then all of a sudden it's like,
oh my God,
I love Miami.

815
00:51:11.920 --> 00:51:13.870
Of course you do.
Who Does it?

816
00:51:15.850 --> 00:51:19.180
What do you need from me?
I need you to love Cincinnati.

817
00:51:19.450 --> 00:51:23.140
That's what the fuck I need from you.
Why don't you come on those trips?

818
00:51:23.170 --> 00:51:26.920
That's when I fucking need you.
So anyway,
she's going to Europe,
right?

819
00:51:27.030 --> 00:51:29.170
There's not,
you know,
there's no fucking way,
of course I'm going to take her.

820
00:51:29.171 --> 00:51:29.950
So this is the deal.

821
00:51:29.950 --> 00:51:34.360
I spent five months on the fucking road with my knees to my chest,
my wallet,

822
00:51:34.361 --> 00:51:35.710
my front fucking pocket,

823
00:51:35.890 --> 00:51:40.270
going in the back doing fucking yoga because I had to make sure I had a great

824
00:51:40.271 --> 00:51:40.810
special.

825
00:51:40.810 --> 00:51:43.930
Of course they ended up catching a cold and I did my special with dayquil.

826
00:51:44.020 --> 00:51:45.400
But that's a whole nother story.

827
00:51:46.740 --> 00:51:47.180
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

828
00:51:47.180 --> 00:51:51.620
<v 2>So basically,
you know,
41 year old guy,
my body's fucking junk.</v>

829
00:51:51.920 --> 00:51:56.150
This is my first time going to the U K and then over to Dublin.

830
00:51:56.600 --> 00:52:00.050
And then back to fucking Scotland,
uh,
which I believe,
you know,

831
00:52:00.051 --> 00:52:04.400
I'm a little confused of exactly what is Great Britain and what is United

832
00:52:04.400 --> 00:52:05.720
Kingdom?
It's really fucking confusing.

833
00:52:05.840 --> 00:52:08.630
They got so many Goddamn Ailey's has over there.
All right.

834
00:52:08.631 --> 00:52:12.110
As far as I understand,
Great Britain is England,

835
00:52:12.140 --> 00:52:14.120
Wales and Scotland,

836
00:52:14.510 --> 00:52:19.250
and maybe even the top of a of Ireland with a,

837
00:52:19.580 --> 00:52:23.930
the fuck was all those Goddamn fucking fight and Belfast.

838
00:52:25.520 --> 00:52:28.160
Okay.
Is,
is that,
uh,

839
00:52:29.060 --> 00:52:33.140
is that the United is the United Kingdom.
That is Great Britain.

840
00:52:33.920 --> 00:52:35.840
Just England and fucking Wales.

841
00:52:35.960 --> 00:52:40.580
Is that Great Britain or as Great Britain in England,
Wales and fucking Scotland.

842
00:52:40.820 --> 00:52:44.510
Why don't I look at it?
I didn't look it up.
Fuck you.

843
00:52:44.570 --> 00:52:46.090
This is my question for the week.
What,

844
00:52:46.140 --> 00:52:50.540
what's the difference between the United Kingdom and,
and,
and uh,

845
00:52:51.050 --> 00:52:53.810
Great Britain?
Because before I went over there,

846
00:52:53.811 --> 00:52:55.340
I wanted to learn some of the countries over there,

847
00:52:55.341 --> 00:52:57.230
so I didn't come off as a dumb ass American.

848
00:52:57.440 --> 00:53:00.470
Then I found out there was 50 countries and I was like,
all right,
fuck it.

849
00:53:00.471 --> 00:53:05.270
I'll just learn it over to like Greece,
Romania,
Ukrainia,
Lithuania.

850
00:53:05.510 --> 00:53:09.650
All the anus,
Russia,
half of Georgia,
half a Turkey.

851
00:53:09.651 --> 00:53:12.590
And then once she gets a Cag is Stan go fuck yourself over the hell he's saying.

852
00:53:13.760 --> 00:53:17.900
Um,
I,
I was under the impression that England was a country

853
00:53:19.550 --> 00:53:22.100
and then when I was looking at the names of country,
it didn't say that.

854
00:53:22.101 --> 00:53:25.680
It said Great Britain,
Great Britain is the country.

855
00:53:25.681 --> 00:53:28.770
What does that include and what is the United Kingdom,

856
00:53:29.520 --> 00:53:32.460
the rest of Ireland is and part of it is it all right?
Yeah,
I dunno,

857
00:53:32.510 --> 00:53:36.000
you little ass fucking pieces of land over there.

858
00:53:36.001 --> 00:53:37.770
Maybe you guys got a band together,
you know,

859
00:53:37.771 --> 00:53:41.580
like a bunch of fucking Cubans coming over here and a refrigerator door floating

860
00:53:41.581 --> 00:53:46.140
over to fucking the keys,
you know,
I don't know.

861
00:53:46.170 --> 00:53:47.910
So anyways,
so this is the deal.

862
00:53:47.911 --> 00:53:52.530
So I get a first class ticket from Jersey day for out London and uh,

863
00:53:52.560 --> 00:53:56.760
my girl wants to go.
So once again,
I'm in that situation,

864
00:53:57.590 --> 00:54:02.040
I mean that situation.
And it's like,
you know what,

865
00:54:02.520 --> 00:54:07.320
I got to put my foot down.
I finally did.
I said,
look,

866
00:54:08.310 --> 00:54:11.790
this is much fun as we are going to have over there and everything.

867
00:54:11.791 --> 00:54:15.090
This is a business trip.
I have to go over there,

868
00:54:15.270 --> 00:54:17.320
I have to be fucking relaxed.

869
00:54:17.830 --> 00:54:22.230
I'm already going to be jet lagged and I have to hit three home runs in a

870
00:54:22.231 --> 00:54:25.050
fucking row.
I got to kill in London,

871
00:54:25.051 --> 00:54:29.760
I got to kill in Dublin and I got a kill in Glasgow.
Um,

872
00:54:29.820 --> 00:54:30.241
all right,

873
00:54:30.241 --> 00:54:33.450
so as much as you want to run around and go buy some trinkets and shit,

874
00:54:33.480 --> 00:54:38.340
I have to be rested up for this stuff.
So,
uh,
this is the deal.

875
00:54:38.341 --> 00:54:41.460
I will fly coach with you to Jersey.
And then,
uh,

876
00:54:41.461 --> 00:54:46.110
I'm going up FirstClass to England and I put her in the back,

877
00:54:46.140 --> 00:54:49.890
left her in the back and uh,
you know,

878
00:54:49.891 --> 00:54:53.250
there was some rough waters trying to convince her of that.

879
00:54:54.810 --> 00:54:56.820
And I was like,
look,
this is the deal.
I'm going to go over there,

880
00:54:56.821 --> 00:54:59.940
I'm going to fucking hit.
And then when,
if I fucking blow up over there,

881
00:54:59.941 --> 00:55:02.580
I'll fly is both over there first fucking class.

882
00:55:03.510 --> 00:55:06.420
So because my girl's fucking the shit.
She said fine.

883
00:55:07.930 --> 00:55:09.280
So I'm like,
that's it man.

884
00:55:09.281 --> 00:55:13.630
You see that Shit Mack Daddy fucking pimp got what the fuck I wanted and then

885
00:55:13.631 --> 00:55:15.910
this is what's funny.
Two days before we go to leave,

886
00:55:16.270 --> 00:55:21.040
I get hit with this fucking wave of guilt.
Oh wait a second.
By the way.

887
00:55:22.270 --> 00:55:24.810
Um,
I looked into getting her first class fucking ticket.

888
00:55:24.820 --> 00:55:29.110
You know what these fucking cops wanted?
They wanted like fucking five grand

889
00:55:30.620 --> 00:55:34.940
just from Jersey.
It's fucking ridiculous.
It's so fucking,

890
00:55:34.941 --> 00:55:36.980
it's so fucking ridiculous.

891
00:55:37.160 --> 00:55:41.210
Why is it 1500 to fly 2,800 miles,
but now all of a sudden,

892
00:55:41.211 --> 00:55:44.840
3000 miles big are a little over three 3,300 miles because I'm going to a

893
00:55:44.841 --> 00:55:48.880
different country.
Yeah.
They all of a sudden your foot,

894
00:55:49.010 --> 00:55:52.770
you'll make it like three and a half times the fucking price.
So I can't do that.

895
00:55:52.771 --> 00:55:57.040
I go over there,
I'm going to lose a couple of grant.
So I just,
you know,
fuck it.

896
00:55:57.200 --> 00:55:59.190
And she complained.
She complained a little bit and I go,

897
00:55:59.191 --> 00:56:02.640
are you complaining about a free fucking ticket to Europe?

898
00:56:02.641 --> 00:56:03.820
Is that what you're doing right now?

899
00:56:09.430 --> 00:56:09.680
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

900
00:56:09.680 --> 00:56:13.970
<v 2>So anyways,
I ended up feeling fucking guilty and a whatever.</v>

901
00:56:14.840 --> 00:56:16.100
So I got her some DVDs.

902
00:56:22.710 --> 00:56:25.120
Ah,
so anyways,
you finally landed in a safe route and I,

903
00:56:25.180 --> 00:56:28.060
we get off the plane and I wait for her and Shit and I noticed that she's,

904
00:56:28.210 --> 00:56:30.970
you know,
kind of giving me the cold shoulder or whatever.
I'm like,

905
00:56:30.971 --> 00:56:31.870
what's the problem?

906
00:56:32.920 --> 00:56:36.310
And I F I can't remember how it went because I was so fucking tired and she was

907
00:56:36.311 --> 00:56:40.630
pissed because I didn't go back to see her during the flight,
you know,

908
00:56:41.590 --> 00:56:43.870
come back there and we went,
what were we going to talk about?

909
00:56:43.900 --> 00:56:45.460
I was going to come back to him and be like,
yeah,
hey,

910
00:56:45.461 --> 00:56:49.960
there's just flying coach still suck.
All right.
I was just checking,

911
00:56:50.260 --> 00:56:53.770
you know,
cause it kind of seemed like it shot from La to New Jersey,

912
00:56:53.771 --> 00:56:56.590
but I was wondering maybe it got better.

913
00:56:58.150 --> 00:57:02.890
I'm actually in defense myself.
I tried to go back there,
but they had a,

914
00:57:03.180 --> 00:57:05.560
uh,
a velvet rope.
Okay.

915
00:57:05.561 --> 00:57:08.200
And I'm not saying that they had a bunch of Janet Jackson's CDs there.

916
00:57:08.201 --> 00:57:12.490
They actually had a velvet rope there and I was not allowed to go past there.

917
00:57:13.480 --> 00:57:17.080
And I said,
fine.
All right.
So I got out of that one,
so whatever,
whatever.

918
00:57:18.430 --> 00:57:22.480
All right.
So we landed a fro and,
uh,

919
00:57:22.510 --> 00:57:23.590
we get in the fucking car,

920
00:57:23.710 --> 00:57:26.680
we drive over to the hotel and I'm just looking at it going,
this looks a little,

921
00:57:26.681 --> 00:57:30.610
a very gray,
very overcast.

922
00:57:31.050 --> 00:57:35.020
And it was disappearing into a lot of gray buildings.
And I'm like,
what the fuck?

923
00:57:35.680 --> 00:57:39.850
I don't like this.
And um,
and I,
you know,

924
00:57:39.900 --> 00:57:44.900
I took a fucking nap and then I woke up and then we did what New Yorkers fucking

925
00:57:45.131 --> 00:57:48.430
do.
All right.
We don't take tours.

926
00:57:48.920 --> 00:57:51.760
I do consider myself a fucking New Yorker,
but now,
no,
I don't,

927
00:57:51.761 --> 00:57:53.830
not affiliated with any of their sports teams,

928
00:57:54.400 --> 00:57:57.220
but I lived there for fucking 12 years and I loved it.
And,
uh,

929
00:57:57.221 --> 00:57:59.860
this is what New Yorkers do when we go to a fucking new city,

930
00:58:00.220 --> 00:58:01.990
public transportation baby.

931
00:58:02.110 --> 00:58:05.990
Show me where you fucking subway is and I'll do it that way.
We had a company,

932
00:58:05.991 --> 00:58:09.040
you know,
Big Ben Parliament,
Bang,
zoom.

933
00:58:09.280 --> 00:58:13.690
Then we just walk the fuck around and we find the cool places to go to.

934
00:58:13.780 --> 00:58:18.040
All right.
We don't go to the dumb shit.
Like one of my buddies,

935
00:58:18.041 --> 00:58:22.260
when you go to Dublin,
go to temple bar.
That's the fucking place to go.
Yeah.

936
00:58:22.261 --> 00:58:26.050
So I can have a drink with some guy from Cleveland.
You fucking moron.

937
00:58:27.220 --> 00:58:28.870
Go where all the tourists go.
I've,

938
00:58:28.871 --> 00:58:33.871
I've never fucking understood why he would go on vacation to then hang out with

939
00:58:34.181 --> 00:58:37.900
a bunch of other douche bags who aren't from where the fuck you're going.

940
00:58:38.650 --> 00:58:40.720
So what experience do you gain there?

941
00:58:40.750 --> 00:58:45.640
What somebody from Rhode Island is like in London?
It's the dumbest shit ever.

942
00:58:46.870 --> 00:58:49.620
Okay.
You want to see a couple of things like when I,

943
00:58:49.621 --> 00:58:53.530
I gotta admit when I saw a big Ben,
it was,
it was fucking awesome.

944
00:58:54.710 --> 00:58:58.360
I've seen pictures of that and you know,
I'm a,
I love watching Wimbledon,

945
00:58:59.110 --> 00:59:01.780
Wimbledon,
I for years,
I've been saying Wimbleton yet,

946
00:59:01.810 --> 00:59:06.810
yet another word that I'd been mispronouncing a t o n Wimble ton,

947
00:59:07.330 --> 00:59:12.220
but it's Wimbledon done and Wimbledon,
they just said too fucking fast.

948
00:59:12.221 --> 00:59:14.310
So my dummy or is to pro actually not my dummy.

949
00:59:14.500 --> 00:59:17.170
Here's my brain's stooped dump to process the signals from my years.

950
00:59:17.171 --> 00:59:21.860
I think my ears are okay.
But anyways,
um,
so yeah,

951
00:59:21.861 --> 00:59:25.520
that's what we did.
So I saw a big Ben and it was just fucking iconic.

952
00:59:26.130 --> 00:59:29.120
Who's the shit all those years watching Wimbledon breakfast at Wimbledon and

953
00:59:29.121 --> 00:59:32.420
then they,
they always show big Ben and um,

954
00:59:33.890 --> 00:59:38.810
it was incredible.
And,
uh,
got a a,
what else the fuck did I do?
Oh,
I know.

955
00:59:38.811 --> 00:59:41.990
I want it to that the,
toward it to,
uh,

956
00:59:42.650 --> 00:59:46.160
the fucking Abbey road studios fell through.
It's a long fucking story.

957
00:59:46.161 --> 00:59:48.710
They couldn't do it Wednesday.
And by when they wanted to do a Thursday,

958
00:59:48.711 --> 00:59:50.750
I was doing radio and it just didn't fucking work out,

959
00:59:51.230 --> 00:59:54.290
so I'll have to do that next time.
But,
uh,
so I was like,
all right,

960
00:59:54.291 --> 00:59:56.900
that didn't work out.
Um,

961
00:59:56.990 --> 01:00:00.890
I have to go see Royal Royal Albert Hall.
Now,

962
01:00:00.891 --> 01:00:03.680
for those of you who are led Zeppelin fans,
you know,

963
01:00:03.950 --> 01:00:07.370
the importance of that building.
And if you got them there,

964
01:00:07.880 --> 01:00:10.520
last DVD that came out,

965
01:00:10.610 --> 01:00:14.300
it has this fucking unbelievable concert that they gave at Royal Albert Hall.

966
01:00:14.301 --> 01:00:18.710
And I always wanted to go there.
It's really difficult to save Royal Albert Hall.

967
01:00:19.550 --> 01:00:21.590
And,
uh,
it was something that was built,

968
01:00:21.591 --> 01:00:25.430
I believe by this Queen Victoria that I just say this Queen Victoria's this

969
01:00:25.431 --> 01:00:29.420
fucking broad Queen Victoria.
She was into this guy who,
uh,

970
01:00:29.810 --> 01:00:34.130
prince fucking Albert and I guess they were unbelievably in love with each
other.

971
01:00:34.131 --> 01:00:36.260
And the way that they express love was they,

972
01:00:36.280 --> 01:00:39.260
they bought pieces of art with the money from the poor.

973
01:00:43.250 --> 01:00:44.420
That's what they did.

974
01:00:44.600 --> 01:00:49.600
They were so in love that rather than taking all the fucking disgusting amount

975
01:00:50.751 --> 01:00:55.700
of taxes from the poor people and using it to feed them,
they said,
no,

976
01:00:55.820 --> 01:00:58.850
let's spend it lavishly on ourselves

977
01:01:00.590 --> 01:01:02.690
in this unbelievable art collection that we,

978
01:01:02.691 --> 01:01:06.290
and we alone could sit here and stare at it.
It's just fucking,
I don't know,

979
01:01:06.291 --> 01:01:10.340
that whole royalty thing is hilarious to me.
So,
uh,
yeah,

980
01:01:10.341 --> 01:01:15.250
that's what they did.
And uh,
I dunno.

981
01:01:15.260 --> 01:01:18.380
And then Prince Albert,
uh,
he caught the clap,

982
01:01:18.410 --> 01:01:22.940
which evidently was fatal back in the day.
He cheated on her,

983
01:01:22.941 --> 01:01:25.910
but she still loved him.
And a,
something like that.

984
01:01:25.911 --> 01:01:27.650
I didn't really read the story.
You can look it up.

985
01:01:28.430 --> 01:01:29.910
I don't know what the fuck he got.
He got like,
what'd,

986
01:01:30.080 --> 01:01:32.630
what'd he die of in the 18 hundreds,
the mumps,

987
01:01:34.850 --> 01:01:37.940
he got to Berkeley loss.
He got something.
Okay.

988
01:01:38.870 --> 01:01:43.870
He was fucking Victoria out and they'll the great lawn in some mosquito bit him.

989
01:01:44.151 --> 01:01:47.270
And next thing you know,
he had typhoid fever.
I don't know.
He died suddenly.

990
01:01:47.690 --> 01:01:51.380
So she was overcome with grief.
And a lot of people say she never got over it.

991
01:01:52.070 --> 01:01:57.070
And what she did was she built this big fucking statue of this guy that actually

992
01:01:58.761 --> 01:02:03.290
is not gold plated,
but gold leaf or fleck.
I don't know what the,

993
01:02:03.410 --> 01:02:07.920
it's actual fucking gold in it.
And it's got a big,
um,

994
01:02:08.030 --> 01:02:11.910
opulent roof to it.
So the pigeons can't shed on the guy.
And uh,

995
01:02:12.010 --> 01:02:16.610
you know why yet again,
yet again to express her love for another human being.

996
01:02:16.611 --> 01:02:17.990
Why would you help other human beings?

997
01:02:17.991 --> 01:02:21.780
Let's spend more of the poor people's money on this.
It's pretty impressive.

998
01:02:22.210 --> 01:02:25.050
Not going to lie to you.
So anyways,
went over,

999
01:02:25.051 --> 01:02:29.640
we saw that shit and they were actually giving a tour of Royal Albert Hall.

1000
01:02:30.270 --> 01:02:34.560
So I wanted to go and it was an hour delay.
And my girl hates tours.

1001
01:02:35.130 --> 01:02:37.200
She's a fucking New Yorker.
She's like,
oh my God,

1002
01:02:37.201 --> 01:02:41.350
I can fucking figure it out myself.
But it's a fucking building.
So Mike,

1003
01:02:41.390 --> 01:02:44.520
can we just,
can you just for me?
Can we just fucking do this?
So she's like,
fine.

1004
01:02:45.600 --> 01:02:47.640
So long story short me,

1005
01:02:47.700 --> 01:02:52.700
we ended up going on the bloody toe and it just so happens that the London

1006
01:02:55.470 --> 01:02:57.450
Philharmonic is practicing in there.

1007
01:02:57.451 --> 01:03:00.720
I don't know for a Gig later on that night or the next day,
I have no idea what.

1008
01:03:01.350 --> 01:03:06.350
So the guy brings us in there and we walk in two boxes down,

1009
01:03:09.370 --> 01:03:13.470
um,
from where the queen's boxes.
Okay,

1010
01:03:13.530 --> 01:03:18.480
I'm waiting for the beef is and butthead laugh.
He said Queens box,

1011
01:03:19.440 --> 01:03:21.930
um,
the box where the queen sits in

1012
01:03:23.480 --> 01:03:28.480
the just basically unbelievable seats and we come walking in and as we sit down

1013
01:03:29.311 --> 01:03:34.050
and take in basically the most beautiful theater I've ever seen in my life,

1014
01:03:35.280 --> 01:03:37.620
the beauty of the theater,
right as we sit down,

1015
01:03:37.621 --> 01:03:40.770
the orchestra begins playing as if they were waiting for us.

1016
01:03:41.790 --> 01:03:46.790
And it was so unbelievably beautiful and so overwhelming that my girlfriend

1017
01:03:47.131 --> 01:03:50.550
actually started to cry.
So,

1018
01:03:50.580 --> 01:03:55.580
and I started laughing at my girlfriend crying because I was actually afraid

1019
01:03:56.071 --> 01:03:59.520
that I was going to get emotional.
That's how fucking unbelievable it was.

1020
01:03:59.760 --> 01:04:02.910
It was incredible.
And it was in that moment I was like,
fuck this,

1021
01:04:02.911 --> 01:04:04.440
I have to see a concert here.

1022
01:04:04.740 --> 01:04:07.560
It was in credit and everybody was basically on our tour,

1023
01:04:07.710 --> 01:04:12.490
was sitting there with like,
I that I don't,

1024
01:04:12.500 --> 01:04:15.630
I don't have the ability to describe the sound.

1025
01:04:15.660 --> 01:04:18.570
It was the most unbelievable sound I've ever heard in my life.

1026
01:04:19.050 --> 01:04:22.380
And it actually made me less cynical.
That's how beautiful it was.

1027
01:04:22.381 --> 01:04:24.540
I actually felt,
I actually,

1028
01:04:26.990 --> 01:04:31.140
what the fuck was it?
I got,
how do I put this?
It was like,
I,
you know,

1029
01:04:31.141 --> 01:04:33.750
I'm real cynical when I think of people,
I think that pieces of shit,

1030
01:04:33.751 --> 01:04:36.150
they fucking lie.
They're greedy,

1031
01:04:36.151 --> 01:04:38.640
they're weak cowardice and all that fucking thing.

1032
01:04:38.641 --> 01:04:41.430
And then you just see this group of people in this building,

1033
01:04:41.431 --> 01:04:45.570
like everything was perfect.
The p the,
the construction of it,
the,

1034
01:04:45.571 --> 01:04:47.580
the way they decorated it and the,

1035
01:04:47.581 --> 01:04:52.320
whoever wrote the music and then all the gifted people playing in.
It was,
it was,

1036
01:04:52.410 --> 01:04:55.290
it was fucking unbelievable.
We will all just sitting there,

1037
01:04:56.100 --> 01:05:00.960
it's like something that I will never forget.
And then he fucking,

1038
01:05:01.920 --> 01:05:06.480
10 seconds later the tour guys like,
alright,
we gotta go,
we gotta go.

1039
01:05:06.490 --> 01:05:09.000
No one wanted to go.
And then he's like out in the hall,
gone.

1040
01:05:09.450 --> 01:05:12.660
And then this wall here was constructed by Henry the fucking eighth.

1041
01:05:12.661 --> 01:05:14.040
And it's like,
nobody gives a fuck.

1042
01:05:14.070 --> 01:05:18.750
We want to go back in there and listen to the band.
It was unreal.
So what,

1043
01:05:18.751 --> 01:05:22.630
what happened was we just kept going to these rooms,
the rooms,

1044
01:05:22.631 --> 01:05:27.430
the green room where the queen hangs out and has her royal Bush trimmed or

1045
01:05:27.431 --> 01:05:29.980
whatever the fuck they do.
And then we would,

1046
01:05:29.981 --> 01:05:32.560
we would be in a different part of the theater.
We would dip in,
we would,

1047
01:05:32.561 --> 01:05:36.340
we would listen to them play again.
And uh,
this is the thing,

1048
01:05:36.341 --> 01:05:41.020
you were not allowed to take video in the place,
but uh,

1049
01:05:42.070 --> 01:05:45.910
fortunately I'm an ignorant American and I didn't give a fuck and I brought a

1050
01:05:45.911 --> 01:05:49.020
little,
uh,
when I was little flip cameras in there and I actually,
uh,

1051
01:05:49.050 --> 01:05:53.140
I got some video footage in there that I will be putting up on my website.
Um,

1052
01:05:53.560 --> 01:05:56.630
I'm just going to try to edit it all together.
Um,

1053
01:05:56.650 --> 01:06:00.280
actually follow through on this and make a nice video of my trip to Europe.

1054
01:06:00.700 --> 01:06:05.350
But uh,
I gotta tell you guys something right fucking now.
Okay.

1055
01:06:06.730 --> 01:06:10.330
Fuck going to sea world.
Fuck the San Diego Zoo.

1056
01:06:10.600 --> 01:06:12.010
Fuck all of that shit.

1057
01:06:12.580 --> 01:06:17.580
Fuck going to Chicago and go into the top of the Sears tower and go into Wrigley

1058
01:06:17.951 --> 01:06:22.090
field.
That shit's all going to be there.
You fucking live here.

1059
01:06:22.380 --> 01:06:26.650
All right.
No biggie.
You can drive to all of those things.

1060
01:06:26.651 --> 01:06:30.760
Let me tell you something.
Saved your fucking money.
Who gives a shit?

1061
01:06:30.761 --> 01:06:33.970
It's not worth anything anyways.
Get yourself a ticket at some point.

1062
01:06:33.971 --> 01:06:38.570
Go look up Royal Albert Hall.
If you're in a classical music,
they have a,

1063
01:06:38.630 --> 01:06:42.850
they call them prom shows.
I don't know what that was short for,
but,
uh,

1064
01:06:42.880 --> 01:06:45.430
they have like this,
this like month or two,

1065
01:06:45.640 --> 01:06:49.150
six week period where they just have all these orchestras come in.

1066
01:06:49.270 --> 01:06:52.630
If you're into classical music,
I saw another concert in October.

1067
01:06:52.631 --> 01:06:56.560
Jeff Beck is playing there.
You know that guys,
you know,
it's weird.

1068
01:06:56.561 --> 01:06:58.900
He's getting up there in years and he's at the Primers,
Korea.

1069
01:06:58.960 --> 01:07:02.500
Basically what I'm saying,
if you're a music lover,
at some point in your life,

1070
01:07:02.610 --> 01:07:05.050
if you are,
if you ever need even into just fucking architecture,

1071
01:07:05.290 --> 01:07:09.310
you have to go see a show there.
Okay?
I'm telling you,

1072
01:07:10.050 --> 01:07:13.810
it was fucking unbelievable.
All right.
And that's it.
That's it for that shit.

1073
01:07:13.880 --> 01:07:16.480
All right.
Um,
unbelievable.

1074
01:07:16.481 --> 01:07:21.100
So I'm going to try to get back their book a Gig and,

1075
01:07:21.520 --> 01:07:25.030
uh,
I have to see,
I have to see,
and I,
I would fucking see anybody there.

1076
01:07:26.700 --> 01:07:28.420
Wow.
Okay.
Let's,
let's be fucking honest.

1077
01:07:29.080 --> 01:07:32.020
I gotta admit Jay z and Beyonce were there.

1078
01:07:32.170 --> 01:07:35.830
I wouldn't want to see Jay z at Royal Albert Hall.
I just wouldn't,

1079
01:07:37.030 --> 01:07:37.361
you know,

1080
01:07:37.361 --> 01:07:42.250
I was actually picturing led Zepplin there and like the place was so beautiful,

1081
01:07:42.251 --> 01:07:45.880
it almost seemed like fucking offensive,

1082
01:07:46.930 --> 01:07:50.110
you know,
for them to be singing the lemon song,

1083
01:07:53.530 --> 01:07:58.000
talking about singing poetically about getting your Dick sucked in someplace

1084
01:07:58.001 --> 01:08:00.760
that beautiful.
Now I'm not shitting on Jay Z or anything.

1085
01:08:00.761 --> 01:08:03.250
I think that guy's a fucking genius.
But you know what I mean?

1086
01:08:04.090 --> 01:08:07.270
Like I don't think that I,
like if I ever got a gig there,

1087
01:08:07.271 --> 01:08:10.060
I'd want to do it just cause zeppelins been there,
Sinatra,

1088
01:08:10.280 --> 01:08:14.800
Jay z and all these guys,
these unbelievable artists.
But for me to go up there,

1089
01:08:14.830 --> 01:08:17.180
the way I curse,
it just wouldn't be right.

1090
01:08:21.160 --> 01:08:22.190
I,
you know,

1091
01:08:22.310 --> 01:08:26.990
this is why you travel the world is you get you two reasons why you travel.
Okay.

1092
01:08:26.991 --> 01:08:31.991
One is to see all the unbelievable things that are out there and realize how

1093
01:08:32.451 --> 01:08:34.700
much more there is than what you thought there was.

1094
01:08:34.730 --> 01:08:38.810
And then two on the other side is to realize,
you know,

1095
01:08:38.811 --> 01:08:42.050
as you start to get homesick,
why you love where you live.

1096
01:08:42.230 --> 01:08:43.550
Because that definitely happened.

1097
01:08:44.390 --> 01:08:47.690
Cause I gotta admit I fucking went hardcore with the food over there.

1098
01:08:48.770 --> 01:08:51.200
I kept getting the traditional English breakfast,

1099
01:08:51.570 --> 01:08:53.120
the traditional Irish breakfast.

1100
01:08:53.121 --> 01:08:57.140
I got a traditional Scottish breakfast and I'm telling you,
dude,

1101
01:08:57.141 --> 01:08:58.250
it's fucking,

1102
01:08:59.220 --> 01:09:02.820
I like how those people are still walking around past the age of 40.

1103
01:09:02.821 --> 01:09:07.040
It's fucking unreal.
Traditional English breakfast was eggs,

1104
01:09:09.030 --> 01:09:13.110
sausage or bangers is,
they call them.
Um,

1105
01:09:14.130 --> 01:09:14.210
<v 7>okay.</v>

1106
01:09:14.210 --> 01:09:14.840
<v 2>Bacon.</v>

1107
01:09:14.840 --> 01:09:19.010
And that Bacon is more like Canadian Bacon where it looks like you took the zest

1108
01:09:19.040 --> 01:09:19.873
of a pig

1109
01:09:21.350 --> 01:09:26.230
with a big greater and just took a fucking shingle of pig and through it and

1110
01:09:26.600 --> 01:09:30.950
throw it into a frying pan.
So you got the fucking sausage,

1111
01:09:31.320 --> 01:09:35.030
the shingle of pig,
and then you had the pork and beans.

1112
01:09:36.350 --> 01:09:37.630
And then,
uh,
I dunno,

1113
01:09:37.640 --> 01:09:42.590
something else and I got to tell you all that fucking pork.
Basically.

1114
01:09:42.591 --> 01:09:47.000
Two helpings of pork,
three helpings of fucking pork sausage,

1115
01:09:48.140 --> 01:09:48.973
sausage,

1116
01:09:49.490 --> 01:09:54.490
Canadian Bacon style to the 10th power in pork and beans with eggs and toast.

1117
01:09:55.870 --> 01:10:00.440
Know,
and then you have a cup of tea.
And a,
I got,
I met dude,
I fucking loved it.

1118
01:10:00.680 --> 01:10:03.860
I absolutely loved it.
But like now a week later,
uh,

1119
01:10:03.861 --> 01:10:07.400
physically I'm feeling the fucking pa every morning I got up and I got that

1120
01:10:07.401 --> 01:10:12.080
breakfast.
And,
um,
what else did I do?

1121
01:10:12.110 --> 01:10:15.890
I went to a,
I went to,
oh,
the crosswalk there.

1122
01:10:15.891 --> 01:10:17.660
I got the picture of the Abbey road thing.

1123
01:10:17.661 --> 01:10:21.380
The picture comes out like shit because you gotta be standing in the middle of

1124
01:10:21.381 --> 01:10:24.890
the fucking road.
And,
uh,
I took a video of it.
You got to see it.

1125
01:10:24.891 --> 01:10:28.580
It's one of the greatest,
um,
tourist.

1126
01:10:30.380 --> 01:10:34.430
I'm not even to do it just to observe it because basically if you're not

1127
01:10:34.431 --> 01:10:38.660
familiar with the Beatles,
uh,
you know,
it's a really a shame.

1128
01:10:38.740 --> 01:10:40.310
You should listen to their music.
Okay.

1129
01:10:40.340 --> 01:10:45.020
That's like the biggest understatement of all fucking time.
But basically,
um,

1130
01:10:46.810 --> 01:10:51.220
you know,
Abbey road is basically the four Beatles walking across the crosswalk.

1131
01:10:51.310 --> 01:10:54.610
So now everybody when they go there was a Beatles fan that has to have four

1132
01:10:54.611 --> 01:10:56.470
people and take that fucking picture.

1133
01:10:56.920 --> 01:10:58.720
And the reality is they've actually moved across,

1134
01:10:59.110 --> 01:11:02.050
walk like 20 feet down the fucking street scene are walking where they walked.

1135
01:11:02.800 --> 01:11:05.060
But anyways,
um,
yeah,

1136
01:11:06.310 --> 01:11:10.940
the greatest fucking thing is people stop in the fucking crosswalk cause they

1137
01:11:11.140 --> 01:11:12.400
want to get the Goddamn picture,

1138
01:11:12.640 --> 01:11:16.320
which I actually fucks up the picture because I think they took the picture

1139
01:11:16.390 --> 01:11:18.450
where they were all walking,
but long story shot short,

1140
01:11:18.451 --> 01:11:21.170
all the poor bastards who live over there have to,

1141
01:11:21.580 --> 01:11:25.320
who live in that part of town and have to deal with that every fucking day.

1142
01:11:25.470 --> 01:11:29.010
It's the most annoying tours de thing I've ever seen in my fucking life.

1143
01:11:29.370 --> 01:11:30.420
And you've got all these people all

1144
01:11:30.920 --> 01:11:34.110
<v 1>cited.
Oh my God,
it's Abbey Road.
Wait,
let's get the,
I want to be Chad Lanning.</v>

1145
01:11:34.730 --> 01:11:38.490
Let me be Paul running around in these and then you just listen to these English

1146
01:11:38.491 --> 01:11:42.810
people beep in the home.
If for fuck sakes,
you're fucking codes big.

1147
01:11:44.070 --> 01:11:46.080
It was awesome.
The whole thing was awesome.

1148
01:11:46.081 --> 01:11:50.010
So we're actually getting this almost like 38 minutes in and I have to fucking

1149
01:11:50.011 --> 01:11:53.170
meet Bobby to go on a hike.
So I gotta wrap this shit up here quickly.
Okay.

1150
01:11:53.850 --> 01:11:58.680
<v 2>Um,
so anyways,
did all that type of shit.
Saw Big Ben,
went out,
had some drinks,</v>

1151
01:11:58.681 --> 01:11:59.760
had a great fucking time.

1152
01:11:59.761 --> 01:12:04.761
And then I did my show and a show at the Lester theater when went incredible.

1153
01:12:07.020 --> 01:12:09.450
Um,
I just had an awesome time,
man.

1154
01:12:09.451 --> 01:12:11.310
And I want to thank you really from the bottom of my heart.

1155
01:12:11.311 --> 01:12:16.311
Everybody who came out in England and London Dublin and uh,

1156
01:12:16.680 --> 01:12:20.280
in Glasgow was fucking awesome.
So,
so basically,
yeah,
we did that.

1157
01:12:20.340 --> 01:12:22.230
And then the next day we,
uh,

1158
01:12:22.260 --> 01:12:26.730
we flew over to Dublin and the Irish people would just fucking hilarious.

1159
01:12:28.200 --> 01:12:32.580
Um,
my show at the sugar club went on unbelievable.
And a,

1160
01:12:33.090 --> 01:12:34.290
afterwards I was hanging out with the crowd.

1161
01:12:34.291 --> 01:12:37.170
I had a couple of drinks with people in this fucking guy's like,

1162
01:12:38.010 --> 01:12:41.420
this Irish guy comes up to me,
he goes,
hi,
I love you.
I love him,

1163
01:12:41.550 --> 01:12:43.810
but let me bust you.
Let me buy you a drink.
Hi,
love.
Yeah.
Right.

1164
01:12:43.920 --> 01:12:47.970
And he fucking buys me a goddamn drink and then he won't fucking leave.

1165
01:12:49.110 --> 01:12:54.090
He says sweaty drunk dude with this.
He looks like he plays in a grunge band.

1166
01:12:54.091 --> 01:12:56.760
You know what the fucking hat on and he just won't fucking leave.

1167
01:12:56.790 --> 01:13:00.660
And he's drunk and he keeps coming up and he keeps trying to touch my fucking

1168
01:13:00.661 --> 01:13:04.500
hair,
which I had most of what I have left on top.
Right.

1169
01:13:05.580 --> 01:13:08.190
So finally he ends up fucking,

1170
01:13:08.400 --> 01:13:12.840
he comes out of nowhere with this sweaty drunk hair and it fucking like pets.

1171
01:13:12.841 --> 01:13:17.010
The top of my head,
another man pet the top of my head.

1172
01:13:17.390 --> 01:13:22.100
So my girl goes to,
what the fuck are you doing?
And
he goes,
Oh,

1173
01:13:22.101 --> 01:13:23.790
I'm sorry I touched his,
we've

1174
01:13:28.880 --> 01:13:30.960
<v 1>no,
I'll tell you something.
I am a fucking asshole.</v>

1175
01:13:30.961 --> 01:13:32.940
But when somebody gets me with the good one,

1176
01:13:33.420 --> 01:13:37.230
the only reason why I didn't burst out laughing in fucking high five and for how

1177
01:13:37.231 --> 01:13:42.231
fucking funny that was a was because he's one of these psychos that if you give

1178
01:13:42.870 --> 01:13:45.450
them any sort of,
I wasn't even giving them any of it,
any attention,

1179
01:13:45.451 --> 01:13:49.350
he wouldn't fucking leave.
So I actually,
if I actually did,
um,

1180
01:13:49.440 --> 01:13:53.190
and then I was laughing later like me and my girl both fucking laughing that he

1181
01:13:53.191 --> 01:13:56.630
said it was a weave and it's like maybe because I shaved my head and uh,

1182
01:13:56.760 --> 01:14:00.300
when I grew it back I had a lot more hair than people thought I did that he

1183
01:14:00.301 --> 01:14:04.260
thought I got hair plugs or or or something.
But Oh man,

1184
01:14:04.261 --> 01:14:08.430
it was fucking hilarious.
Um,
so anyways,
uh,

1185
01:14:08.460 --> 01:14:12.040
that was Dublin that we,
that was only on dove for like two seconds.

1186
01:14:12.490 --> 01:14:17.490
<v 2>We've got this hilarious cab driver and he was driving us to the airport and</v>

1187
01:14:17.501 --> 01:14:18.191
all,
and by the way,

1188
01:14:18.191 --> 01:14:21.700
all these Scottish guys were over there cause they had this huge rugby match and

1189
01:14:21.701 --> 01:14:25.330
I totally got into the rugby over there.
They got this league,
the uh,

1190
01:14:25.331 --> 01:14:29.170
the six nations league that I think is Scotland,
Wales,

1191
01:14:30.040 --> 01:14:34.760
England as it three,
Ireland,
France and Italy.
Uh,

1192
01:14:34.780 --> 01:14:38.290
there's only 16,
so reminded me of hockey like the fucking original six.

1193
01:14:38.500 --> 01:14:42.250
There's not that many players.
He can get to know the teams.
So long story short,

1194
01:14:42.460 --> 01:14:45.070
if Ireland won the game the day we were leaving,

1195
01:14:45.310 --> 01:14:48.790
if Ireland when the game than they were the champions of the league and if

1196
01:14:48.791 --> 01:14:52.900
Scotland lost,
they would be the worst team in the league.

1197
01:14:52.930 --> 01:14:57.040
Thus winning the wooden spoon,
wooden spoon,

1198
01:14:57.041 --> 01:14:59.080
they actually give you a fucking award.
It's like,

1199
01:14:59.230 --> 01:15:04.120
like you don't know that you are the worst just in case you forget in Noda rugby

1200
01:15:04.120 --> 01:15:07.690
,
they give you something called the wooden spoon,
you know,

1201
01:15:07.691 --> 01:15:11.860
just so people can fucking rub that.
I think that's brilliant.
Fucking brilliant.

1202
01:15:12.130 --> 01:15:17.130
I think it's hilarious because that's such a great way to give like a team shit.

1203
01:15:17.801 --> 01:15:20.990
Like take the Pittsburgh pirates.
How many fucking wooden spoons would they,

1204
01:15:21.040 --> 01:15:25.750
they would be like the New York Yankees of wooden spoons and it's just a whole

1205
01:15:25.751 --> 01:15:30.610
nother level to give somebody shit.
So basically when we were over there,

1206
01:15:30.611 --> 01:15:34.660
all these squats came over to watch the game and uh,

1207
01:15:34.661 --> 01:15:36.430
all the Irish people were talking shit.

1208
01:15:36.490 --> 01:15:40.990
I was just fucking gray talking about their,
their,
their kilts in O and.

1209
01:15:40.991 --> 01:15:41.824
M.

1210
01:15:42.100 --> 01:15:46.450
So I got so amped up by watching these guys give each other shit and I wasn't

1211
01:15:46.451 --> 01:15:49.360
getting any American sports that I had when I landed in Scotland.

1212
01:15:49.460 --> 01:15:53.140
The the next day I actually watched the game and it was a fucking great game in

1213
01:15:53.141 --> 01:15:54.220
Scotland won.

1214
01:15:55.060 --> 01:16:00.060
They actually won and avoided getting the wooden spoon and Ireland actually lost

1215
01:16:00.491 --> 01:16:04.480
the championship because of that.
And I believe France one with,

1216
01:16:04.630 --> 01:16:09.430
it's just something wrong about French people winning a rugby contents,
you know,

1217
01:16:09.820 --> 01:16:10.541
championship.

1218
01:16:10.541 --> 01:16:14.500
Considering the stereotype of them and considering I'd never been there,

1219
01:16:14.530 --> 01:16:18.220
wait a minute,
this guy wasn't Andre the giant French.
The fuck is wrong with me.

1220
01:16:18.221 --> 01:16:23.050
I'm such an idiot.
All right,
scratch all that,
whatever.
So I got into it and um,

1221
01:16:23.290 --> 01:16:27.490
then my last night there,
I um,
I went to a,

1222
01:16:27.491 --> 01:16:30.640
the Lyons Theatre in Glasgow,

1223
01:16:30.641 --> 01:16:33.130
Scotland and uh,
you know,

1224
01:16:33.131 --> 01:16:37.300
I was so tempted to go out there but I didn't want to fuck my show up by pissing

1225
01:16:37.301 --> 01:16:42.070
everybody off.
But I really wanted to go up and open with,
rather than be like,

1226
01:16:42.071 --> 01:16:44.590
hey,
how are you guys doing?
I really appreciate you coming out.

1227
01:16:44.710 --> 01:16:45.900
Cause you don't know who the hell I am.

1228
01:16:45.910 --> 01:16:47.940
I really felt like coming out there and just going,

1229
01:16:48.240 --> 01:16:53.050
how are you doing your fucking skirt?
Wearing could just open it up

1230
01:16:56.380 --> 01:16:57.520
just to see what they do.

1231
01:16:57.630 --> 01:17:00.670
And I realized halfway through the show that they probably would have laughed.

1232
01:17:01.270 --> 01:17:05.920
But,
uh,
I got great video of all of them.
Uh,

1233
01:17:06.530 --> 01:17:08.320
they,
I got the whole crowd saying,
you're,

1234
01:17:08.321 --> 01:17:10.370
you're listening to the Monday morning podcast.

1235
01:17:10.370 --> 01:17:11.240
<v 1>You fucking cons.</v>

1236
01:17:11.690 --> 01:17:14.360
But she can understand what they're saying because there's too many of them.

1237
01:17:14.840 --> 01:17:19.020
I had my heart in the right place.
Um,
maybe I'll put it up with some actual,
uh,

1238
01:17:19.920 --> 01:17:22.450
what they subtitles underneath it.
You're watching the,
yeah,

1239
01:17:22.540 --> 01:17:26.660
you're listening to the Monday morning podcast.
You're fucking code.

1240
01:17:27.590 --> 01:17:30.350
They really leaned into it too.
I'll put the video,

1241
01:17:30.351 --> 01:17:31.670
it's all gonna be part of the video.

1242
01:17:31.850 --> 01:17:36.850
But I sincerely want to thank everybody who came out to see my shows.

1243
01:17:37.341 --> 01:17:38.930
I was unbelievably flattered

1244
01:17:39.300 --> 01:17:42.510
<v 2>by the,
uh,
the reception I got when I was over there.
Like,</v>

1245
01:17:42.540 --> 01:17:44.010
people were actually clapping,

1246
01:17:44.370 --> 01:17:47.640
like they knew who I was and it was incredible.

1247
01:17:47.820 --> 01:17:50.910
And that was another thing that I learned when I was over there was the,
uh,

1248
01:17:52.310 --> 01:17:56.180
like the different levels of fame.
Like over here I have a,

1249
01:17:56.630 --> 01:18:01.100
like I say,
I have notoriety.
That's where I'm at,
you know,

1250
01:18:01.400 --> 01:18:04.470
second degree notoriety.
Like every once in a while someone was like,
Hey,

1251
01:18:04.640 --> 01:18:09.460
that comedian guy.
Right.
Eh,
thank you.
Funny.
I,
I used to be on a,

1252
01:18:10.370 --> 01:18:14.090
you're on that show right?
Once you on that show.
Yeah,
yeah.
It was on this show.

1253
01:18:15.440 --> 01:18:18.230
Um,
but just to go over there and see,
I said,

1254
01:18:18.231 --> 01:18:23.231
like John Mayer had a sold out show at Wembley Stadium and added a second show.

1255
01:18:24.620 --> 01:18:28.850
And I was like,
wow,
that fucking dude is famous.

1256
01:18:29.900 --> 01:18:32.130
Okay.
And um,
you know,

1257
01:18:32.300 --> 01:18:37.070
when we get into the entertainment game and as a performer,
when you start,

1258
01:18:37.071 --> 01:18:39.560
you know,
trying to sell tickets,
you know,

1259
01:18:39.650 --> 01:18:43.040
and the first time you sell out a fucking comedy club,
you can't believe it.

1260
01:18:43.041 --> 01:18:47.300
And just to see someone to be able to move that amount of tickets on the other

1261
01:18:47.301 --> 01:18:48.560
side of the fucking world,

1262
01:18:49.750 --> 01:18:53.500
<v 1>it's,
it's unreal.
For those of you unfamiliar with Wembley Stadium,</v>

1263
01:18:53.501 --> 01:18:56.980
this is how big it is.
Evil Knievel did a stunt there.

1264
01:18:58.120 --> 01:19:02.680
He fucking jumped over like,
like 30 buses.
London double deckers.

1265
01:19:02.681 --> 01:19:04.090
Granted he didn't fucking make it,

1266
01:19:04.510 --> 01:19:08.890
but just picture how fast you'd have to get a motorcycle going today.

1267
01:19:09.040 --> 01:19:13.030
Forget about a motorcycle 40 fucking years ago or 35 years ago.

1268
01:19:13.150 --> 01:19:15.040
That probably weighed two tons.

1269
01:19:16.390 --> 01:19:16.990
<v 8>Yeah.</v>

1270
01:19:16.990 --> 01:19:20.700
<v 1>And he bet he cleared the buses.
I think he landed on the last one.
That's a hit.</v>

1271
01:19:20.920 --> 01:19:24.040
That's some footage right there that you might want to check all you x game

1272
01:19:24.041 --> 01:19:28.570
people cause he's the fucking father,
all of that shit.
Um,
so anyways,

1273
01:19:29.730 --> 01:19:30.370
<v 8>yeah,</v>

1274
01:19:30.370 --> 01:19:32.160
<v 1>John Mayer sold that fucking place out in these,
these,</v>

1275
01:19:32.300 --> 01:19:35.030
he's got another one coming up,
added a show there.

1276
01:19:35.031 --> 01:19:39.980
So I was really a humbled going over there and um,

1277
01:19:40.610 --> 01:19:42.590
and I'm looking forward to coming back again,

1278
01:19:43.110 --> 01:19:44.870
going to a concert at Royal Albert Hall.

1279
01:19:45.420 --> 01:19:47.700
Go into rugby game and either Scotland or

1280
01:19:49.300 --> 01:19:53.120
a fucking Ireland and just coming through all those again.

1281
01:19:53.121 --> 01:19:54.650
I definitely want to build up a following over there.

1282
01:19:54.651 --> 01:19:57.050
Cause I had a great time after actually actually after my,

1283
01:19:57.080 --> 01:20:01.760
my Gig in the Lyons theatre,
I went over to um,
this,

1284
01:20:01.761 --> 01:20:05.570
this comedy club and dude,
it was fucking hilarious.
Uh,

1285
01:20:05.571 --> 01:20:10.020
we walked in there and we will listen to the host of the show and the guy is

1286
01:20:10.500 --> 01:20:15.270
speaking English and we cannot understand 80% of what he's saying.

1287
01:20:15.360 --> 01:20:19.890
So we're laughing along with the crowd,
not at the jokes,

1288
01:20:19.891 --> 01:20:23.170
just because fuck fucking hold Ridge Hagen rejected a fucking hotel room.

1289
01:20:23.490 --> 01:20:27.780
It's like what you guys remember that when,
when in snatch,

1290
01:20:27.781 --> 01:20:30.210
when Brad Pitt play that Irish character,
you couldn't understand.

1291
01:20:30.360 --> 01:20:32.850
This was the Scottish Scotland version of that.

1292
01:20:33.900 --> 01:20:37.260
And I met this comedian Kevin Bridges,
who's I guess huge over there.

1293
01:20:37.560 --> 01:20:41.700
Not even guess.
He is huge over there.
Afterwards we have a couple of pints

1294
01:20:43.230 --> 01:20:48.090
and um,
I started talking about the word cunt and I was too drunk.

1295
01:20:48.091 --> 01:20:49.230
I wish I filmed it.

1296
01:20:50.220 --> 01:20:53.210
Listening to these guys talk about the word content,

1297
01:20:53.230 --> 01:20:57.720
the way they say it would have been so perfect on this podcast at some point.

1298
01:20:57.721 --> 01:21:02.400
I have to,
I have to interview one of those two guys on this podcast.
But,
um,

1299
01:21:03.600 --> 01:21:04.640
I was sitting there going,
yeah,

1300
01:21:04.880 --> 01:21:08.250
we're like blown away how you guys can just say cunt and it's not offensive.

1301
01:21:09.210 --> 01:21:13.230
And they're like,
Yo,
hi,
everybody says that when they come over here,
blah,
blah,

1302
01:21:13.231 --> 01:21:16.920
blah,
blah,
and all this shit.
Right?
So I was talking to him,
I'm like,
yeah,

1303
01:21:16.921 --> 01:21:21.540
you actually use it as like,
like a compliment.
You say stuff like,
Oh,
you know,

1304
01:21:21.541 --> 01:21:25.080
he's,
he's a good client.
And the other guy goes,
he goes,
oh,

1305
01:21:25.081 --> 01:21:27.870
he's a great content top couldn't,

1306
01:21:31.080 --> 01:21:34.710
so there you go.
There's a new expression for you.
He's a top client.

1307
01:21:35.250 --> 01:21:38.770
I think that's the greatest things I've ever heard.
So I'm,

1308
01:21:38.771 --> 01:21:41.880
I'm saying to these guys,
um,
ah,

1309
01:21:41.980 --> 01:21:42.791
<v 2>fuck,
why did I film?</v>

1310
01:21:42.791 --> 01:21:45.510
You would have loved this shift if you're a stand up geeky didn't want to you,

1311
01:21:45.670 --> 01:21:49.720
you just want to see like we would trade notes like I was saying.
So I go,

1312
01:21:49.721 --> 01:21:52.240
so what is basically the c word?

1313
01:21:52.241 --> 01:21:56.860
What is the word you can't say over in Scotland?
And he said,

1314
01:21:57.640 --> 01:22:02.290
uh,
spastic is what he said spastic.

1315
01:22:02.291 --> 01:22:04.390
And he tried.
He was explaining to me,
but,
but granted,

1316
01:22:04.391 --> 01:22:08.290
we were both fucking shit faced and I could barely understand what this dude was

1317
01:22:08.291 --> 01:22:11.000
saying when we were both sober.
Right.
But he was,

1318
01:22:11.020 --> 01:22:16.020
I guess it means I couldn't figure it meant some form of like a retarded slash

1319
01:22:19.601 --> 01:22:24.490
vegetable and like,
I dunno like that.
They just don't,
you just,

1320
01:22:24.670 --> 01:22:26.980
you don't talk about that stuff over there.
If you do,

1321
01:22:27.070 --> 01:22:30.490
I guess it's literally needle going off the fucking record player.

1322
01:22:31.060 --> 01:22:35.860
But um,
so I thought that that was really a,
I thought that that was interesting.

1323
01:22:36.070 --> 01:22:37.000
What else?
Oh,

1324
01:22:37.150 --> 01:22:41.290
here's something you guys better brace yourselves for as far as pop culture

1325
01:22:41.291 --> 01:22:45.220
thing that I saw over there on their American idol over there.
Um,

1326
01:22:46.560 --> 01:22:47.910
<v 1>there's a,
there's this</v>

1327
01:22:49.710 --> 01:22:53.520
<v 2>wins and they got these high top fades like that dude from kid and play.</v>

1328
01:22:55.170 --> 01:22:58.290
Um,
I think it was play the light skin dude,
right?

1329
01:22:58.350 --> 01:23:03.120
With the fucking high top for that fucking beyond that.
The eraser head fade,

1330
01:23:03.121 --> 01:23:06.280
right?
Two white kids,
they both have that do,

1331
01:23:06.880 --> 01:23:11.880
they're twins named John and Edward and they go by the name Jedward I sweat

1332
01:23:14.470 --> 01:23:18.250
and they're really into vanilla ice.
They think vanilla ice is awesome.

1333
01:23:18.850 --> 01:23:20.680
And the reporter was going,
you know,

1334
01:23:20.740 --> 01:23:24.310
people kind of ridiculed him and they're like,
oh,
but when he freestyles,

1335
01:23:24.460 --> 01:23:29.410
he's lethal.
So I didn't even have to hear what the fuck they sing.

1336
01:23:29.440 --> 01:23:32.950
I just know that some shit is so bad.
It's fucking awesome.

1337
01:23:32.951 --> 01:23:37.951
So I'm just just telling you to get prepared for that because I think that that

1338
01:23:38.021 --> 01:23:43.000
could go global.
That's it's like the perfect storm of fucking awful.

1339
01:23:43.270 --> 01:23:45.520
So do you remember you heard it here first in the states.

1340
01:23:46.030 --> 01:23:50.650
Watch out for Jedward look them up if you have to.
Um,
all right,

1341
01:23:50.770 --> 01:23:54.310
we're 50 minutes into this thing.
I got fucking rap.
This fucking thing up.

1342
01:23:54.340 --> 01:23:58.810
What did I want to talk about?
I have any fucking,
any other stories?
Whatever.

1343
01:23:58.811 --> 01:24:01.900
This is just the English podcast.
I'll give you one fucking overrated,

1344
01:24:01.901 --> 01:24:04.000
underrated thing that's really annoying.

1345
01:24:04.001 --> 01:24:06.940
The shit out of me is this whole thing.

1346
01:24:07.330 --> 01:24:11.200
Then when you go in to get a fucking Burrito,
all right,

1347
01:24:11.800 --> 01:24:16.120
or a Taco and they asked you what toppings you want and you get whatever

1348
01:24:16.121 --> 01:24:18.880
toppings you want.
Then all of a sudden if you want to get Guacamole,

1349
01:24:19.060 --> 01:24:22.600
this whole bullshit,
that Guacamole's extra,

1350
01:24:23.320 --> 01:24:25.810
oh that's 50 cents extra.
That's a dollar extra.

1351
01:24:26.020 --> 01:24:30.220
Like Avocados are fucking rare.
Maybe on the east coast,

1352
01:24:30.221 --> 01:24:33.310
but I got to admit I got a two friends of mine who own houses out here.

1353
01:24:33.460 --> 01:24:37.330
They got fucking avocado trees in their goddamn yard.

1354
01:24:38.980 --> 01:24:41.830
They just,
it's one of those things where just like diamonds,
I always,

1355
01:24:41.831 --> 01:24:44.500
you always hear that rumor that diamonds aren't really rare.

1356
01:24:44.800 --> 01:24:48.190
They just say they are and they just control how many go out.

1357
01:24:48.340 --> 01:24:52.240
That's what they're trying to do with fucking guacamole.
I put up with it.

1358
01:24:52.270 --> 01:24:54.820
It was one kind of fucking food.
I didn't give a shit.

1359
01:24:55.090 --> 01:24:59.260
I paid extra for the Guacamole.
I didn't give a fuck and you know what I did?

1360
01:24:59.380 --> 01:25:00.160
I came by,

1361
01:25:00.160 --> 01:25:05.160
became part of the mechanism that created that new corporate fucking cogent way

1362
01:25:06.790 --> 01:25:11.140
of,
uh,
making an extra money.
And I'll tell you why,
because you know what?

1363
01:25:11.320 --> 01:25:16.240
I got a breakfast sandwich the other day and Bacon was extra,
you know,

1364
01:25:16.600 --> 01:25:19.300
like all of a sudden,
that's his big fucking commodity.

1365
01:25:19.540 --> 01:25:22.480
So you can add that to your fucking list of over priced,

1366
01:25:23.310 --> 01:25:24.310
overpriced fucking bullshit.

1367
01:25:24.460 --> 01:25:28.330
Disposable razors locked up behind the fucking counter,

1368
01:25:28.630 --> 01:25:31.570
like their jewels,
orange juice,

1369
01:25:32.470 --> 01:25:36.580
guacamole,
and fucking now bacon self.

1370
01:25:36.581 --> 01:25:40.780
This is what we gotta do.
Everybody,
the 14 fucking people,
if they say it's extra,

1371
01:25:40.781 --> 01:25:42.520
be like,
you know what,
that,
I don't want it.

1372
01:25:43.390 --> 01:25:48.100
Why don't you sit on your fucking vacant?
Let's smell it going bed.
That's it.

1373
01:25:48.130 --> 01:25:49.540
I'm not playing fucking ball.

1374
01:25:50.280 --> 01:25:54.010
Only time I'm fucking getting guacamole's on home and I'll make it myself.

1375
01:25:54.130 --> 01:25:57.070
Or if these fucking cunts don't charge me any extra money,

1376
01:25:57.490 --> 01:26:00.040
but you know what they'll do,
right.
You know what they'd do?
They'll be like,

1377
01:26:00.041 --> 01:26:01.180
all right,
it's not extra anymore,

1378
01:26:01.181 --> 01:26:04.100
but the fucking Burrito is 50% more and they'll play on nine

1379
01:26:04.100 --> 01:26:08.740
<v 1>11 because of nine 11.
They always win.
They always win.</v>

1380
01:26:09.140 --> 01:26:10.030
There's the last thing I want to tell you.

1381
01:26:10.270 --> 01:26:12.850
This is the one thing I loved about Scotland.
You know,

1382
01:26:12.851 --> 01:26:16.720
they say whores over there.
They say,

1383
01:26:17.380 --> 01:26:20.830
hires these fucking hours doing drugs.

1384
01:26:22.510 --> 01:26:25.480
The floor was the flower.
I'm fucking up the accent.

1385
01:26:27.960 --> 01:26:32.910
Well,
these folk in hires doing drugs,
her's whores hat,
Jelly.

1386
01:26:32.970 --> 01:26:37.430
They said,
I fucking loved it.
I loved every fucking second of it.
Um,

1387
01:26:37.500 --> 01:26:40.950
that's it.
That's the end of the podcast.
I got some shit I got to fucking do.

1388
01:26:41.250 --> 01:26:44.490
I apologize that this thing was so late,
but I'm telling you,
you know,

1389
01:26:44.610 --> 01:26:48.860
good things come to those who fucking wait,
I think this was a great podcast.

1390
01:26:48.861 --> 01:26:52.890
I'm gonna Pat Myself on the back.
Listen to this.
That was make,

1391
01:26:53.500 --> 01:26:57.750
it's really fucking the back of my neck,
my spine area.
That fucking hurt.

1392
01:26:57.940 --> 01:27:00.660
All right,
you guys have a great week.
God bless and don't worry.

1393
01:27:01.260 --> 01:27:04.140
It's a little rough time here.
It's sort of a podcast,
recession.

1394
01:27:04.430 --> 01:27:06.390
We're riding our way through it.
All right.

1395
01:27:06.790 --> 01:27:08.490
<v 0>I'll talk to your fucking constantly.</v>

1396
01:27:20.230 --> 01:27:21.063
[inaudible]

1397
01:28:06.570 --> 01:28:06.570
[inaudible].
