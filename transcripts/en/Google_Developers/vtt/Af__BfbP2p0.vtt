00:00:07.167 --> 00:00:10.200
Neuberg: So within
your career, what are one of

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.634
the one or two things
that you're really proud of

00:00:11.634 --> 00:00:14.200
in the sense of what
you were just talking about.

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:18.133
Marks: The things
I'm proud of is where

00:00:18.133 --> 00:00:21.100
looking at something
and sort of simplifying

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:24.200
and clarifying it, um,
can make some sense,

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:25.767
and that that can have
a broader impact.

00:00:25.767 --> 00:00:27.400
So the stuff
with microformats,

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:28.801
where we basically said,

00:00:28.801 --> 00:00:30.801
"Whoa, couldn't we just
use HTML to represent data?

00:00:30.801 --> 00:00:33.133
Why do need to define
something else?"

00:00:33.133 --> 00:00:34.701
And then take that constraint
and work that through.

00:00:34.701 --> 00:00:35.968
That was nice.

00:00:35.968 --> 00:00:39.434
Or the work with OpenSocial,
where we said,

00:00:39.434 --> 00:00:41.567
"Here's a lot of people
doing the same thing.

00:00:41.567 --> 00:00:42.834
"but they're not talking
to each other.

00:00:42.834 --> 00:00:44.067
"Can we make them
talk to each other

00:00:44.067 --> 00:00:45.300
and standardize that?"

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.868
I'm very excited about that.

00:00:46.868 --> 00:00:48.834
But it's--those are the things
that are harder to point at

00:00:48.834 --> 00:00:50.367
and say, "You're running
my code."

00:00:50.367 --> 00:00:52.767
It's much more these days
of, "Here's a bunch of ideas

00:00:52.767 --> 00:00:55.334
that I've helped catalyze
and fit together."

00:00:55.334 --> 00:00:57.234
And I, you know, I can't
take credit for

00:00:57.234 --> 00:00:58.667
all the focus,
all the organization

00:00:58.667 --> 00:01:00.200
in any respect at all.

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:01.667
But if I've been part
of helping people

00:01:01.667 --> 00:01:03.601
to converse and connect
about that,

00:01:03.601 --> 00:01:04.968
that's what I'm proud of.

00:01:07.467 --> 00:01:09.334
He--he was a lovely guy.

00:01:09.334 --> 00:01:11.934
He was very, very, you know,
very, very smart,

00:01:11.934 --> 00:01:13.400
very interesting to talk to.

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:17.067
Um, he's--and I still keep
citing him.

00:01:17.067 --> 00:01:21.000
He wrote this wonderful piece
in 1999 about the internet

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.501
that I just cannot resist
citing at every opportunity

00:01:23.501 --> 00:01:25.133
because he got so much right.

00:01:25.133 --> 00:01:27.434
To some extent, he was--

00:01:27.434 --> 00:01:29.501
he was living in the future

00:01:29.501 --> 00:01:31.767
because--I suppose
partly because

00:01:31.767 --> 00:01:33.133
he had more money to spend
on technology

00:01:33.133 --> 00:01:34.634
than most people had.

00:01:34.634 --> 00:01:36.534
But he wrote a whole bunch
of things saying,

00:01:36.534 --> 00:01:38.367
"Why is it we have to use
cables for everything?"

00:01:38.367 --> 00:01:39.601
And "Why does everything

00:01:39.601 --> 00:01:41.234
have a different
power supply" and stuff.

00:01:41.234 --> 00:01:44.467
Which, if you look at now,
we have Bluetooth and Wi-Fi.

00:01:44.467 --> 00:01:46.734
We have standardized
USB charge.

00:01:46.734 --> 00:01:48.100
We have a whole bunch
of stuff like that,

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.000
and there's the stuff
that he wrote, you know,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.667
10, 15 years ago that was
pointing out

00:01:51.667 --> 00:01:53.000
the problems
with the technology,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.267
and--but in a witty
and funny way

00:01:55.267 --> 00:01:56.601
that made people stop
and think about it.

00:01:58.434 --> 00:02:02.634
And if you actually sit there
and watch live TV,

00:02:02.634 --> 00:02:04.100
the only reason
you're watching live TV

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.234
is you're waiting
for something to happen.

00:02:06.234 --> 00:02:08.701
So you're watching baseball,
and most of it is boring,

00:02:08.701 --> 00:02:10.367
and there's a few little bits
where it's exciting.

00:02:10.367 --> 00:02:12.133
Or you're watching--you know,

00:02:12.133 --> 00:02:13.767
the Presidential election
waiting for the outcome.

00:02:13.767 --> 00:02:15.467
Or you're watching
some news thing.

00:02:15.467 --> 00:02:17.834
And the live bits of this
are generally

00:02:17.834 --> 00:02:20.334
people filling dead air waiting
for something to happen.

00:02:20.334 --> 00:02:21.701
Saying, "Well, I expect
somebody's gonna come out

00:02:21.701 --> 00:02:23.067
of the car soon."

00:02:23.067 --> 00:02:25.534
And I began to realize
that this was actually

00:02:25.534 --> 00:02:27.400
a recipe for, you know,

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.200
a lot of stuff that isn't
very interesting.

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.567
The thing that is interesting
about live

00:02:32.567 --> 00:02:33.834
is when it's two-way.

00:02:33.834 --> 00:02:35.434
That's the only time
you actually need it.

00:02:35.434 --> 00:02:37.901
And I think the same
problem runs through

00:02:37.901 --> 00:02:39.434
lots of these media,

00:02:39.434 --> 00:02:43.534
is that we see them as
simulacra of previous media.

00:02:43.534 --> 00:02:45.133
And that leads to two traps.

00:02:45.133 --> 00:02:47.100
One trap is
it then becomes a battle.

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:48.934
When is blogging
going to replace newspapers?

00:02:48.934 --> 00:02:50.167
Which is this boring debate

00:02:50.167 --> 00:02:52.200
that's been going on
for ten years.

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.167
And then, but you also get
this problem

00:02:54.167 --> 00:02:55.968
that you're trying
to model something else.

00:02:55.968 --> 00:02:57.434
That can be useful.

00:02:57.434 --> 00:02:59.167
You know, Wikipedia is trying
to model an encyclopedia.

00:02:59.167 --> 00:03:01.133
That gives a context
that means that

00:03:01.133 --> 00:03:02.934
the edits can work
in that way.

00:03:02.934 --> 00:03:04.501
But it also sets up conflicts

00:03:04.501 --> 00:03:07.200
like the deletionist/
inclusionist debate

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.267
of, "Well, this isn't
important enough

00:03:09.267 --> 00:03:10.300
"to be in the encyclopedia.

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:11.467
We should delete it."

00:03:11.467 --> 00:03:12.934
As opposed to, "Well,
it's a database.

00:03:12.934 --> 00:03:15.367
"How--you know,
what are you wasting

00:03:15.367 --> 00:03:16.734
by putting something
that nobody goes to?"

00:03:19.234 --> 00:03:22.067
A sort of software
development cultural change

00:03:22.067 --> 00:03:24.334
I've seen in my lifetime,
which is--

00:03:24.334 --> 00:03:26.300
You know, I was doing
CD-ROM development.

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:27.734
Now with CD-ROM development,

00:03:27.734 --> 00:03:30.000
you're making little
shiny silver discs

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.667
that you press a million of
and you sell to people.

00:03:32.667 --> 00:03:35.868
And so the model has to be

00:03:35.868 --> 00:03:38.868
lots of lots of upfront
design testing and QA.

00:03:38.868 --> 00:03:40.968
Then you press these things
and go out to try to sell them.

00:03:40.968 --> 00:03:42.667
The difference is
now with the web

00:03:42.667 --> 00:03:44.400
we can dynamically develop.

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.767
We can build something,
put it out there,

00:03:46.767 --> 00:03:48.801
see if it works,
measure it--

00:03:48.801 --> 00:03:51.701
you know, control it,
iterate, try variations

00:03:51.701 --> 00:03:53.033
and keep moving from that.

00:03:53.033 --> 00:03:54.567
So we've got a software
development process now

00:03:54.567 --> 00:03:59.601
that is much more
like, um...experimental.

00:03:59.601 --> 00:04:00.934
It's like, "I'm going
to build something.

00:04:00.934 --> 00:04:02.133
"I'll try a few pieces out.

00:04:02.133 --> 00:04:03.400
I'll iterate and do that."

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.167
So one of the things
I'm seeing is that

00:04:06.167 --> 00:04:08.901
we're doing the same thing
with specifications now.

00:04:11.467 --> 00:04:13.367
OpenSocial is a way
of defining

00:04:13.367 --> 00:04:15.901
social infrastructure
for the web at its--

00:04:15.901 --> 00:04:18.000
at its heart.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.167
And what that means is
a bunch of APIs

00:04:20.167 --> 00:04:21.567
for representing
common operations

00:04:21.567 --> 00:04:23.133
usually around social things.

00:04:23.133 --> 00:04:27.400
So there are four primary
operations there.

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:29.968
There's who--

00:04:29.968 --> 00:04:31.267
profile information
about people

00:04:31.267 --> 00:04:33.167
and connections
between people.

00:04:33.167 --> 00:04:34.734
So we've got
a fairly well-defined set

00:04:34.734 --> 00:04:37.067
of profile specification

00:04:37.067 --> 00:04:40.367
which also maps
to the portable contact stuff.

00:04:40.367 --> 00:04:44.334
It's activities,
things people do,

00:04:44.334 --> 00:04:47.267
so an event stream over time
that's labeled by who did it

00:04:47.267 --> 00:04:49.067
and what they did.

00:04:49.067 --> 00:04:52.334
There's a data persistence
API for OpenSocial,

00:04:52.334 --> 00:04:54.434
which is again
coupled to people,

00:04:54.434 --> 00:04:56.868
so you can store small amounts
of data about people

00:04:56.868 --> 00:05:00.767
and do query back to get
the same data items

00:05:00.767 --> 00:05:03.300
associated with the friends
of the person

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:04.968
that you're looking at.

00:05:04.968 --> 00:05:06.334
So it's basically solving

00:05:06.334 --> 00:05:08.534
the rather messy database
join problem

00:05:08.534 --> 00:05:10.267
of "Tell me about his person
and their friends."

00:05:10.267 --> 00:05:12.901
You're delegating that
to there.

00:05:12.901 --> 00:05:14.467
And the fourth one is
sending messages.

00:05:14.467 --> 00:05:16.601
It's, "I'd like to send
something to this person."

00:05:16.601 --> 00:05:19.501
So those are
the sort of four key APIs.

00:05:19.501 --> 00:05:23.234
But the--the point is
to have a layer of abstraction

00:05:23.234 --> 00:05:25.734
between the container sites

00:05:25.734 --> 00:05:27.567
that are custodians
of social data

00:05:27.567 --> 00:05:30.267
that have rich sets
of information

00:05:30.267 --> 00:05:32.133
about people and
the connections between them

00:05:32.133 --> 00:05:33.868
and the ability to do
this stuff,

00:05:33.868 --> 00:05:37.234
and an application that is
focused on a particular task

00:05:37.234 --> 00:05:39.667
and doesn't want to have
to replicate that host stuff.

00:05:39.667 --> 00:05:42.534
Whereas for any given
application,

00:05:42.534 --> 00:05:44.701
you can almost always
augment it

00:05:44.701 --> 00:05:47.267
and make it more interesting
by connecting it to people

00:05:47.267 --> 00:05:49.167
and to people you know.

00:05:49.167 --> 00:05:51.934
Or even just connecting it
to information about you

00:05:51.934 --> 00:05:53.167
that you're willing
to share.

00:05:53.167 --> 00:05:55.667
If it's--if I know
where you are,

00:05:55.667 --> 00:05:57.000
that's a useful thing.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.501
If I know other places
you've lived,

00:05:58.501 --> 00:05:59.534
that's also useful.

00:05:59.534 --> 00:06:01.033
I can potentially
connect you

00:06:01.033 --> 00:06:02.367
to information
about those places, too.

00:06:02.367 --> 00:06:06.868
There are lots of things
that--that--

00:06:06.868 --> 00:06:09.234
that can make the app more
useful and more intelligent

00:06:09.234 --> 00:06:11.167
by drawing on context,

00:06:11.167 --> 00:06:14.334
but the problem is having
to declare the context

00:06:14.334 --> 00:06:17.234
to the application
each time is very annoying.

00:06:17.234 --> 00:06:18.968
So being able to draw
on the context

00:06:18.968 --> 00:06:20.501
you've already
established elsewhere

00:06:20.501 --> 00:06:22.300
is the sort of key
to OpenSocial.

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:24.801
And so we specify these
different pieces of it

00:06:24.801 --> 00:06:27.367
and have APIs for doing that.

00:06:29.868 --> 00:06:33.734
You know, the key for me
for a spec

00:06:33.734 --> 00:06:35.467
is that people interoperate

00:06:35.467 --> 00:06:37.634
without knowing
of each other's existence

00:06:37.634 --> 00:06:39.267
just because they're writing
to a common spec.

00:06:39.267 --> 00:06:41.934
If you--you know,
if you do that--

00:06:41.934 --> 00:06:44.400
if that happens, then you know
you got something right.

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:48.734
It was a Korean developer,
iDetail, who came to visit.

00:06:48.734 --> 00:06:49.934
They were in the States,
and they said,

00:06:49.934 --> 00:06:50.968
"Can we come and talk
about a proposition?"

00:06:50.968 --> 00:06:51.968
I said sure.

00:06:51.968 --> 00:06:53.234
I was expecting to pitch
to someone.

00:06:53.234 --> 00:06:54.400
I was expecting to say,

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:55.701
"OpenSocial's
a wonderful thing.

00:06:55.701 --> 00:06:57.567
You should build this as part
of your social network."

00:06:57.567 --> 00:06:59.133
And they said, "We've already
built it."

00:06:59.133 --> 00:07:00.367
Neuberg: Oh, that's great.

00:07:00.367 --> 00:07:02.267
Marks: It was like--
I was like, "Oh!"

00:07:02.267 --> 00:07:03.634
"Yeah, look, we use OpenID
and log in here.

00:07:03.634 --> 00:07:05.033
"and we put
an OpenSocial container.

00:07:05.033 --> 00:07:06.834
Oh, and here's our developer
site in Korean

00:07:06.834 --> 00:07:08.601
that explains how other
people can build gadgets."

00:07:08.601 --> 00:07:10.767
And I was like...
okay, that was good.

00:07:10.767 --> 00:07:13.334
So that was my sort of moment
where I said,

00:07:13.334 --> 00:07:15.000
"Yeah, we're a real standard."

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.567
Neuberg: That's a real nice
validation.

00:07:16.567 --> 00:07:18.434
Marks: That's like, yeah,
this is where we are.

00:07:18.434 --> 00:07:20.467
We keep seeing that,
you know.

00:07:20.467 --> 00:07:23.367
As we go around the world
talking about this stuff,

00:07:23.367 --> 00:07:24.901
we keep finding more
and more developers

00:07:24.901 --> 00:07:27.334
who are already there
and building on that.

00:07:27.334 --> 00:07:29.300
And that's what makes
the web work.

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:31.033
You know, the fact
that any web site anywhere

00:07:31.033 --> 00:07:33.934
can publish something
and everyone else can read it.
