00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.430
Athena is now helping out with her final project at the firm, designing a

00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:09.008
concert hall. She loves music so she's very excited. But first things first,

00:00:09.008 --> 00:00:12.604
she needs to learn a bit about how sound travels, so she can help think about

00:00:12.604 --> 00:00:17.576
the acoustics of the space. As a starting point, if you're listening to an

00:00:17.576 --> 00:00:21.224
orchestra or choir in this concert hall, would the music sound louder, sound

00:00:21.224 --> 00:00:24.815
softer, or sound the same, if we walked further away from the stage where the

00:00:24.815 --> 00:00:27.900
musicians are.
