Hi I’m John Green, this is Crash Course
Literature, and today we continue our discussion

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:07.810
of Chinua Achebe’s Things Fall Apart.
Mr. Green, Mr. Green! I can’t even believe

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:11.460
we’re spending two weeks on this book. Like,
it’s about as long as a Babysitter’s Club book.

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.180
Okay, couple things, Me From the Past. First off, the length of a book is not directly proportional to its quality.

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:21.560
Secondly, I could do, like, five Crash Course Literatures
on Babysitter’s Club 26, Claudia and the Sad Goodbye.

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:26.620
Trying to pretend that you didn’t like The Babysitter’s Club so you’ll seem cool - I see through you, Me From the Past!

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:29.740
So, Things Fall apart is interesting on a
lot of levels, and part of that is due to

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:34.739
the historical contexts of the story. And
I did say contexts, plural.

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.559
Because it’s a historical novel about the
colonization of Africa in the late 19th century,

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:44.459
but it was written in the late 1950s, just as European
colonial powers were giving up their colonies.

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.460
And like the novel, Chinua Achebe lived
between these two worlds. So let’s start there.

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:58.480
[Theme Music]

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:03.960
So Chinua Achebe was born Albert Chinuamaluga
Achebe in 1930, about eighty years after the

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:08.070
first missionaries arrived in Igboland.
His father had converted to Christianity,

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.340
hence the Albert, through one of the missionary schools
in Nigeria and became an evangelist for the church.

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:16.920
But the rest of Achebe’s family adhered to the
traditional Igbo culture and religious traditions,

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.920
which meant Achebe spent his childhood at
“the crossroads of culture,” as he once put it.

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:26.560
By the age of eight, he could read in Igbo and
in English. He read Shakespeare and missionary

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.600
texts one day and sat in Igbo storytelling
circles the next.

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.299
And he wrote Things Fall Apart to “retell
the story of my encounter with Europe in a

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:41.180
way acceptable to me,” and to counter the
traditional European view of Africa and Africans

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:45.399
with a human picture that matched the complexity
of actual humans.

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:50.040
And with Okonkwo’s story, Achebe grounds
the reader really deeply in the ancient Igbo

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.260
life and culture before there’s even any
mention of missionaries. So we get a clear

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:59.800
look at the structures and beliefs and traditions that
held the community together before Europeans arrived.

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:03.840
Except, of course, it’s also not a clear look because
one, we’re reading fiction. More importantly,

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:09.460
we’re reading fiction written a hundred years after
European contact. Anyway, early on in Things Fall Apart,

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:14.380
we hear that in Igboland, “The land of the
living was not far removed from the domain

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:19.330
of the ancestors. There was coming and going
between them, especially at festivals and

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:24.370
also when an old man died, because an old
man was very close to the ancestors. A man’s

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:29.320
life from birth to death was a series of transition
rites which brought him nearer and nearer

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:32.910
to his ancestors.”
So Achebe shows us a functioning society with

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:37.090
institutions like the tribal council that
settle disputes and bring order to Igboland.

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:41.230
Now these institutions may not be recognizable
to the Westerners who showed up for the palm

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:44.170
oil, but they had functioned for thousands
of years.

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:47.920
And then, when British missionaries and colonial
governors arrive on the scene, they fail to

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:52.170
understand these institutions and they try
to replace them with their own forms of religion

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.160
and government.
But one of the fascinating things about this

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:58.900
novel is that it doesn’t unambiguously condemn
or praise either worldview, right? Like, there

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.890
are clearly problems with both systems of
justice.

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:06.170
And that really runs counter to the European
essentializing of pre-colonial African lives,

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:11.370
which usually imagines them either as uncivilized
savages or else as these innocents living

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:14.790
in an Edenic utopia.
So Okonkwo is in exile when the Europeans

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:19.790
first show up in the story, but when he returns
to his transformed community, he urges resistance.

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:24.940
But his friend Obierka responds sadly, “It
is already too late. Our own men and our sons

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:29.530
have joined the ranks of the stranger. They
have joined his religion and they help to

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:32.380
uphold his government.”
This is of course particularly interesting

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:37.260
considering that it was written in the context
of a decolonizing late 1950s Africa.

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.980
So how did the British Empire end up coming
to power in Igboland? Well, let’s go to

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.470
the Thought Bubble.
So in the 19th century, when the events of

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:47.970
this story took place, all the great European
powers were busily setting up colonial empires

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:51.430
across the world.
These overseas colonies were a real win/win

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:55.620
for Europe, as they not only furnished raw
materials to feed the manufacturing economies

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:00.750
back home, they also acted as new markets
in which to sell industrial goods. So colonies

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:03.430
were popular.
They were so popular, in fact, that the German

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:07.850
Chancellor organized a conference to divide
up Africa among the Europeans, in order to

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:11.170
avoid any wars over the continent.
They would also have the happy side effect

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:16.180
of spreading the so-called
Three C’s: commerce, Christianity, and civilization.

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:21.600
So, at the Berlin conference of 1885, Africa’s
fate was decided. Oh, also no one from Africa

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:24.900
was invited to the conference, naturally.
In West Africa, much of the colonial trade

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:29.930
had been in slaves prior to 1807, and most
of that horrifying business was done on the

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:33.590
coast. There wasn’t much colonial settling
in the interior until after the slave trade

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:37.130
was banned in the British Empire.
With the slave trade no longer an option,

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:42.360
the British turned to palm trees. Palm oil
made for a great lubricant for industrial

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:47.780
machinery, and after colonization, more than
16 million pounds worth, that’s currency

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:50.560
not weight, by the way, were exported per
year.

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:54.650
The British Empire laid claim to Igboland,
which was rich in palm trees and also non-Christians,

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:58.700
a perfect opportunity to put the three C’s
into practice.

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:01.760
Thanks, Thought Bubble. So, that helps us
to understand the historical context for the

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:06.240
setting of the book. The OTHER historical
context is the time in which it was written.

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:11.280
By 1958, Africa was beginning the process
of decolonization, as European powers gave

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:13.780
up their colonies.
And that meant that throughout Africa, people

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:18.400
were having conversations about what the future
should look like. Should we embrace European-style

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:21.600
nation states?
Should we have some kind of pan-African cooperation?

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:26.220
Marxism, capitalism - who would make a better
ally, the Soviet Union or the United States?

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:30.290
And so in that context, Achebe gives us a
story about the pre-colonial Igbo world,

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:33.920
which has a stability, and a kind of strength
to it, but is certainly not without its problems,

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:37.780
while also giving us a look at colonial Igboland.
But it’s interesting to note that because

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:42.140
he is obsessed with strength and acts out
of fear, Okonkwo doesn’t fare particularly

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:45.920
well under either structure.
But anyway, back to the text. So the British

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:50.040
incursion into Igboland is the focus of the
final part of the book. Missionaries are the

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:53.890
first to arrive in the interior villages,
and at first, there doesn’t seem to be much

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:56.889
cause for alarm.
The first missionary Okonkwo encounters is

00:05:56.889 --> 00:06:02.120
a guy named Mr. Kiaga and he is characterized
as a man of great faith but is thought of

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:05.490
as “harmless.”
Then there’s Mr. Brown, the missionary based

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:11.139
in Umofia, who gained respect through a “policy
of compromise and accommodation.” Mr Brown

00:06:11.139 --> 00:06:15.300
is willing to listen to the villagers talk
about their beliefs, and tries to incorporate

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:18.420
some of their traditions into the practices
of his Christianity.

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:23.870
But then Mr. Brown’s successor in Umofia,
the Reverend James Smith, “saw things as

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:29.730
black and white. And black was evil. He saw
the world as a battlefield in which the children

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:33.860
of light were locked in mortal conflict with
the sons of darkness.”

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:38.030
And Smith’s uncompromising stance inevitably
leads to conflict with the people of Umofia,

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:42.320
and ultimately to the destruction of the mission
church. We’re told “the red-earth church

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:47.680
which Mr. Brown had built was a pile of earth
and ashes. And for the moment the spirit of

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:51.070
the clan was pacified.”
So in three quick steps with three missionaries,

00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:56.280
we go from a harmless one to one whose rigid
belief system leads the community to violence.

00:06:56.280 --> 00:07:00.740
The town then keeps itself armed and ready
for a reprisal, and “Okonkwo was almost

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:04.980
happy again,” we’re told. But instead,
Okonkwo and several other village leaders

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:09.220
are arrested, beaten by their jailers, and
the village is forced to pay a fine.

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:13.050
Okonkwo calls a town meeting to organize a
forceful resistance and when the authorities

00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:17.800
arrive to break it up, he beheads one of the
messengers. And then the gathered villagers

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:23.840
do not rally to his side, and he knows that
his cause is lost. “He knew that Umuofia

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:28.540
would not go to war. He knew because they
had let the other messengers escape.”

00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:33.520
And then when the British District Commissioner
arrives to arrest Okonkwo, he finds that Okonkwo

00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:36.880
has hanged himself.
Achebe closes the novel by revealing the District

00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:41.300
Commissioner’s thoughts about all he had
learned “in the many years in which he had

00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:44.420
toiled to bring civilization to different
parts of Africa.”

00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:48.280
The Commissioner wants to write a book about
his experiences, which he plans to call “The

00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:52.720
Pacification of the Primitives of the Lower
Niger.” And he decides that Okonkwo, the

00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:56.940
textured character we’ve come to know through
the course of this novel, would warrant, “Perhaps

00:07:56.940 --> 00:08:01.630
not a chapter, but a reasonable paragraph.”
In those final moments of the novel, we see

00:08:01.630 --> 00:08:06.060
the loss of humanity that’s inherent to
colonization, and indeed that’s inherent

00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:11.160
to the privileged gazing upon the other.
The European system of colonization so profoundly

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:15.770
failed to see human beings as human beings
that it wrought destruction in Africa and

00:08:15.770 --> 00:08:18.490
across the world.
But of course, Okonkwo and his village are

00:08:18.490 --> 00:08:23.270
not just a paragraph to us. They are not a
footnote. Things Fall Apart, and great books

00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:28.040
like it, help us to wipe away some of the
spots on the lenses of our perception. They

00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:33.010
let us see more clearly, and ask us to imagine
the world and the people in it with more complexity

00:08:33.010 --> 00:08:37.390
and they ask us the big questions, the kinds
that may not easy answers, but are still worth

00:08:37.390 --> 00:08:42.430
pursuing. As Achebe said later in his life,
“Igbo people say, If you want to see it

00:08:42.430 --> 00:08:47.570
well, you must not stand in one place.”
