00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.630
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:20.790
&gt;&gt; Betsy Peterson:
Well, hello everyone.

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:24.550 position:56%
I am Betsy Peterson, the Director
of the American Folklife Center here

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:28.770
at the Library of Congress, and
on behalf of all of the staff,

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:32.630
I want to welcome you here today.

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:37.950
We are at a Botkin Lecture that is
part of the Botkin Lecture series,

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.580 position:56%
and the Botkin Lecture Series allows
the American Folklife Center to work

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:46.680
with leading scholars, artists,
activists and others involved

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.190
in the disciplines of folklore,
folk music, ethomusicology,

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:53.550
oral history and cultural heritage.

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.670
It also allows us to
enhance our archives as well.

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:04.180
In 2014, the AFC began to widen
the scope of the Botkin Lectures

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:07.320
to include open mic
sessions like the one

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.610
that we're going to
have this afternoon.

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:13.410
And during the open mic sessions,
we invite the public in to listen

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:16.090
to an actual archival interview,

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:23.620
and the center very proudly traces
this type of activity back to 1938

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:28.550 position:56%
when Allen Lomax, who was also an
employee of the archive at the time,

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:32.450
sat on the stage of the Coolidge
Auditorium right next door

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.340
and recorded an interview with
the legendary jazz musician,

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:37.830
Jelly Roll Morton.

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:39.640
For the center and the library,

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.680
the Botkin Lecture Series
is also an important part

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.950 position:56%
of our acquisitions activities here.

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:50.310
Each lecture is videotaped and
documented and becomes part

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.230
of our permanent collections.

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:56.710
In addition, Botkin events
are later posted as webcasts

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:00.190
on the library's webcast so
that we can share it with people

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:02.970
around the world and
so that it is available

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:05.390
for future generations as well.

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:06.930
So with all of that said,

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.860
please turn off any cell
phones at this point.

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.020
We would appreciate it.

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:19.010
And now, today -- today is a
very exciting open mic session.

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:23.790
I have the honor of introducing
Mark Moss whose been the editor,

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:30.700 position:56%
executive director and guiding light
of [inaudible] magazine since 1983.

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:34.370
When people talk about the North
American folk music revival,

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:37.630
the first thing that comes to
mind, of course, are the artists,

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:41.300
musicians, performers, revivalists,

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:46.500
singer songwriters whose artistry
has filled stages, coffee houses,

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:51.510
festivals, vinyl grooves since
the 1950's, but in addition

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:57.520
to the performers or in conjunction
with the performers I should say,

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:02.430
the folk music revival also gave
rise to a complex support network

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:07.300
that included concert and record
producers, venue and club owners,

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:11.710
nonprofits, record labels,
radio stations and announcers,

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:17.930
festival programs, programmers
and on and on and on.

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:22.230
In fact, the folk music
revival was significantly aided,

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:26.660
shaped and documented by this
network and by a whole range

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:31.020
of folk music newsletters,
journals and magazines.

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:35.830
And of course, of all of these,
I think none was more important,

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:39.430
innovative or influential
as Sing Out Magazine.

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:41.580
Today, Sing Out editor, Mark Moss,

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:45.500
will be discussing the
legendary publication

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:50.620 position:56%
and the seminole role it played in
the American folk song music revival

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:54.860
and also just talk about the
significance and challenges

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:57.880
of folk music journalism today.

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:03.480
To do this, he will be joined
by two AFC staff members,

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:05.590
Nancy Groce and Steve Winick.

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:09.480
So at this point, welcome
Mark, and I'm going to turn

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:12.070
over everything to Nancy and Steve.

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:13.370
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Welcome.

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:16.990
Thank you all so much for coming,
especially to Mark for coming

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:20.360
down from Pennsylvania
to Washington.

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:25.650
Okay, so what I thought we'd do is
talk to you a bit about the history

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:28.180
of Sing Out in particular.

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:29.480
We have some pictures.

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:33.620
Maybe we'll wait until the
middle to show some images

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:37.730
and then talk more broadly
about the role of journalism

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:42.370
in traditional music and folk
music in the United Staes.

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:43.670
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Okay.

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:44.970
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Sounds good?

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:46.270
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Sure.

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:47.570
But for those familiar with the
Jelly Roll Morton interviews

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:50.330
that Betsy talked about, we will
try not to go on for nuine hours,

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:55.450
but if we do, I see a grammy
winning [inaudible] in our future.

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:58.620
&gt;&gt; Mark Moss: I know my
Mom would be [inaudible].

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:01.680
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: So tell us
a little bit about yourself.

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:05.110
How did you come to
be editor of Sing Out?

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:11.010
&gt;&gt; Mark Moss: Well, in 1972, well
into the history of Sing Out,

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:16.040
I went to Philadelphia folk
festival, and there was a booth

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:20.520
in the back of the festival that
was set up with decades worth

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:24.210
of back issues of the magazine,
and I kind of sauntered up there,

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:27.610
met a fellow by the
name of Josh Dodson

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:32.500
who was running a group
called [inaudible].

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:35.620
Met a fellow named Josh Dodson

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:37.970
who was running an organization
called Friends of Sing

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:39.270
Out at the time, which is kind

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:45.190
of a fundraising booster support
organization, and I just said --

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:50.880
I was 14 years old and
said, "Hey, can I help?"

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:59.290 position:56%
So because to me as a -- somebody
who liked folk music who liked music

00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:03.670
in general and wanted to
find out where it came from,

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:08.430
what traditions were, was really
getting into a lot of early music.

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:12.940 position:56%
We'd gone to summer camp and been
brought up on the Weavers and Peter,

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:22.430 position:56%
Paul and Mary, etc. This was really
-- I felt like I had found my thing.

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:25.860
So I started at that point,
that was my first Sing Out booth

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:31.860
and then throughout the 70's
when I went to college and then

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:38.220
after college ever summer I would
do half dozen or more festivals.

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:41.950
I would load up a car with
all packages of Sing Out,

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:45.420
take them to festivals, sell
subscriptions and things like that.

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:46.720
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: [Inaudible]
volunteer?

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:48.940
&gt;&gt; Mark Moss: It was
strictly as a volunteer.

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:51.490
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: So you mentioned
the Philadelphia Folk Festival.

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:56.520
Was that a big part of your sort
of induction into folk music

00:06:56.520 --> 00:07:00.970
or you were starting to
be involved in the scene?

00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:08.280
&gt;&gt; Mark Moss: Well, I saw Arlo
Guthrie at Carnegie Hall in 1970

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:11.060
and I mean, I was already
into the music,

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:16.990
but it was the first
festival that I'd gone to.

00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:24.260
And I -- so -- but I already
had a growing interest

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:33.700
in traditional music and blues,
old time music, [inaudible] music

00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:41.250
and was sort of looking beyond
the pop folk of the 1960's era

00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:46.070
into the more rooted oriented
stuff, and that's what was sort

00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:49.140
of surprising to me that there was
something like Sing Out out there.

00:07:49.140 --> 00:07:52.300
And honestly a kid growing
up in [inaudible] Valley

00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:55.600
in Pennsylvania hadn't really
come across it too much.

00:07:55.600 --> 00:08:01.030
I mean, so I became really
quickly and avidly involved

00:08:01.030 --> 00:08:02.580
in the magazine at that point.

00:08:02.580 --> 00:08:07.350
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: And the
magazine itself, just to go back

00:08:07.350 --> 00:08:09.470
to the history, was founded when?

00:08:09.470 --> 00:08:12.740
Do you want to talk a little
bit about the roots of Sing Out?

00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:17.240
&gt;&gt; Mark Moss: At the end of the
second world war, there was a group

00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:24.890
of people including notably
Pete Seger, Woody Guthrie,

00:08:24.890 --> 00:08:31.050
Allen was involved in those days --

00:08:31.050 --> 00:08:33.080
[ Inaudible ]

00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:37.950
Paul Rosen was out of the country,
but he was sort of a revered --

00:08:37.950 --> 00:08:42.980
I mean, just to back track a
little bit, when these guys

00:08:42.980 --> 00:08:47.220
who had been part of the New
York City labor music scene

00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:52.470 position:56%
in the late 30's, early 40's had all
gone off into the second world war

00:08:52.470 --> 00:08:56.110
and when they came back, they
sort of got back together again

00:08:56.110 --> 00:09:00.030
and created an organization called
Peoples Artist, Incorporated,

00:09:00.030 --> 00:09:09.530 position:56%
which was really sort of a glorified
booking agency, union of artists

00:09:09.530 --> 00:09:15.460
who were often affiliated with
the Communist party in the U.S.

00:09:15.460 --> 00:09:20.370
and also very involved
with the labor movement.

00:09:20.370 --> 00:09:25.640
And they were -- they were acting
as a booking agency for each other

00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:32.230
to get both -- to work
collaboratively to do recordings

00:09:32.230 --> 00:09:38.450
and to get bookings at labor
meetings, strikes, demonstrations

00:09:38.450 --> 00:09:40.250
and things like that,
and they created

00:09:40.250 --> 00:09:45.290
in 1946 a newsletter
called People Songs.

00:09:45.290 --> 00:09:46.930
First issue was mimiographed

00:09:46.930 --> 00:09:51.220
in Oscar Brand's basement
on a mimiograph machine.

00:09:51.220 --> 00:09:56.130
But Oscar used to love
to tell that story.

00:09:56.130 --> 00:10:03.930
But -- and it went from -- and
Peoples Artist, while it began

00:10:03.930 --> 00:10:10.460
as a relatively small group
of musicians in New York City,

00:10:10.460 --> 00:10:15.880
developed satellite offices so
that there were offices in Arizona,

00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:23.690 position:56%
San Francisco, Chicago that were
all sharing this national newsletter

00:10:23.690 --> 00:10:24.990
that was --

00:10:24.990 --> 00:10:26.290
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: The Peoples Songs?

00:10:26.290 --> 00:10:28.860 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Mark Moss: The Peoples Songs that
was printing songs in the magazine

00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:34.340
as well as news and information
about networking and highlighting

00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:42.600
and trying to preserve and share,
classic labor songs and material,

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:45.120
which was really integral to what
they were doing at that point.

00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:52.410
In 1948, they got very involved in
the Wallace campaign for president.

00:10:52.410 --> 00:10:56.530
And sort of overextended themselves

00:10:56.530 --> 00:11:02.720
so after the Wallace campaign was
unsuccessful as history knows,

00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:07.880
people saw and found themselves
really strapped for cash

00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:10.010
and decided to cancel the magazine.

00:11:10.010 --> 00:11:12.110
So they published one final issue,

00:11:12.110 --> 00:11:16.330
which was the first
issue of the fourth year.

00:11:16.330 --> 00:11:21.860
Each issue was -- the early
ones were just like four pages,

00:11:21.860 --> 00:11:23.990
but they got up to
being like 16 pages.

00:11:23.990 --> 00:11:25.290
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: So
fairly substantial.

00:11:25.290 --> 00:11:28.210
They had a couple thousand
subscribers at that point?

00:11:28.210 --> 00:11:32.440
&gt;&gt; Mark Moss: I think that they
had like about 1200 subscribers

00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:36.830
at its largest distribution
at that point.

00:11:36.830 --> 00:11:41.700
And so the final issue was
just a list of names of people

00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:44.970
who had been involved
and contributed money

00:11:44.970 --> 00:11:49.740
and had been long time subscribers
saying that they were belly up

00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:53.150
and they were giving
up and that was it.

00:11:53.150 --> 00:11:57.110
And there was an outcry from
the membership saying hey,

00:11:57.110 --> 00:11:58.410
wait a minute.

00:11:58.410 --> 00:12:00.740
You didn't ask us what you wanted
us to do and if you wanted us

00:12:00.740 --> 00:12:04.640
to help the magazine
continue in some way.

00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:11.530
And out of those ashes in about
a year later in May of 1950,

00:12:11.530 --> 00:12:14.190
the first issue of
Sing Out was formed.

00:12:14.190 --> 00:12:19.440
Also, run -- the publishing
entity, the ownership of Sing

00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:23.390
Out was Peoples Arts, Incorporated
for the first eight years.

00:12:23.390 --> 00:12:29.800
Now, this was like the first
of many near bankruptcies

00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:32.240
that this group of people had.

00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:42.760
So in the 1950's, it quickly
developed from like a 16 page 5.5

00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:46.600
by 8.5 little pamphlet
that they had put

00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:56.410
out into a pretty substantial
64 then 128 then 164 page little

00:12:56.410 --> 00:13:02.330
magazine, but the 1950's were
like a touch time to be rooted

00:13:02.330 --> 00:13:03.900
in the communist party
and the labor movement.

00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:06.020
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah, talk
about the political situation then

00:13:06.020 --> 00:13:12.190
because Peoples Songs come up in
all of the congressional testimony

00:13:12.190 --> 00:13:13.880
of people like Pete Seger
and all those folks.

00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:15.180
&gt;&gt; Mark Moss: Right.

00:13:15.180 --> 00:13:17.050
Well, I mean, the interesting
this is, of course,

00:13:17.050 --> 00:13:19.580
because I was born in 1955.

00:13:19.580 --> 00:13:23.530
So I was a little young to
have first hand experiences,

00:13:23.530 --> 00:13:29.830
but I did have the honor and
benefit of being able to meet

00:13:29.830 --> 00:13:33.300
and spend some time with Irwin
Silber who was the editor of Sing

00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:43.830
Out after I think it's third
or fourth issue up until 1965.

00:13:43.830 --> 00:13:47.560 position:56%
From his perspective about it --
now, of course, this was years later

00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:51.760
and he was done with Sing Out
for many years after I met him.

00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:53.060
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Right.

00:13:53.060 --> 00:13:55.410
&gt;&gt; Mark Moss: But his perspective
of it was that it was strange

00:13:55.410 --> 00:13:58.950
that anybody thought that
Sing Out was somehow connected

00:13:58.950 --> 00:14:03.290
to the communist party because as
he put it, I never got a phone call

00:14:03.290 --> 00:14:06.640
from anybody at party
headquarters telling me what to do.

00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:10.270
We just did our thing.

00:14:10.270 --> 00:14:14.380
But realistically, I think
it would be irresponsible not

00:14:14.380 --> 00:14:20.580
to acknowledge the fact that these
were people that were at the heart

00:14:20.580 --> 00:14:27.610
and beginning of both the labor
movement from that period of time,

00:14:27.610 --> 00:14:32.190
certainly the beginnings of
the civil rights movement.

00:14:32.190 --> 00:14:38.170
Ultimately, women's rights,
anti-Vietnam, anti-war,

00:14:38.170 --> 00:14:43.490
all of that stuff was
central to what Sing

00:14:43.490 --> 00:14:46.600
Out was at that point in time.

00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:49.480
So they -- Irwin's
approach to this --

00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:55.640
because my later philosophy
about what I saw Sing Out as

00:14:55.640 --> 00:15:00.700
when I became the editor I had some
conversations with Irwin about it.

00:15:00.700 --> 00:15:09.980
My feeling was always -- as a
lay person, as a nonpolitician,

00:15:09.980 --> 00:15:11.860
but somebody who loves history,

00:15:11.860 --> 00:15:16.310
I saw Sing Out as being a folk
music magazine that was influenced

00:15:16.310 --> 00:15:19.440
by the times and the
culture and the politics.

00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:21.650
Irwin did not see it that way.

00:15:21.650 --> 00:15:29.840
He saw it very much as trying
to create a political voice

00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:34.800
and doing it by using music
that he saw as a way to connect.

00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:43.040
So when he would do -- in the
very first issue of Sing Out,

00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:46.090
in fact back into the
Peoples Songs days,

00:15:46.090 --> 00:15:49.750
there was always what they called
international music section.

00:15:49.750 --> 00:15:53.470
Now this was decades and decades
before anybody every heard the

00:15:53.470 --> 00:15:58.570 position:56%
phrase world music or understood the
connection of vernacular cultures

00:15:58.570 --> 00:16:02.700
and traditional musical art forms.

00:16:02.700 --> 00:16:10.400
But Irwin saw the power in trying
to identify and make connections

00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:14.080
so that people would see their
own struggles and their own needs

00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:16.810
in the struggles of
other immigrant groups

00:16:16.810 --> 00:16:19.790
and other marginalized
portions to society.

00:16:19.790 --> 00:16:23.690
Now, for somebody who loves
folk music, what that ended

00:16:23.690 --> 00:16:27.920
up meaning was that you
could come into the magazine

00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:31.890
because you were really interested
in reading about Bill Monroe

00:16:31.890 --> 00:16:36.470
or finding out about
the collection --

00:16:36.470 --> 00:16:40.380
the collecting work that John Jacob
Miles did or something like that.

00:16:40.380 --> 00:16:44.770
But the way that it was presented
in Sing Out generally even

00:16:44.770 --> 00:16:53.130
if it was subtled up a lot
was presented with sort

00:16:53.130 --> 00:16:55.770 position:56%
of an undercurrent to it that let --

00:16:55.770 --> 00:17:00.680
that was shaped by the
political ideology that Irwin

00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:02.030
and the other [inaudible] people --

00:17:02.030 --> 00:17:07.840
now Pete Seger who was
one of the founders

00:17:07.840 --> 00:17:10.750
and honestly the reason
why Sing Out existed,

00:17:10.750 --> 00:17:14.190
the reason why Peoples Songs
existed is because Pete went

00:17:14.190 --> 00:17:16.450
to Harvard to become a journalist.

00:17:16.450 --> 00:17:18.430
That was always his dream.

00:17:18.430 --> 00:17:25.790
As I came to find out in a
difficult way as I was taking

00:17:25.790 --> 00:17:27.630
over the magazine, that this was --

00:17:27.630 --> 00:17:37.490 position:56%
even though Pete was everybody's
founding father of the folk revival,

00:17:37.490 --> 00:17:41.490
certainly my age and probably
a generation before me,

00:17:41.490 --> 00:17:45.650
Pete always saw himself as a
journalist that couldn't get a job

00:17:45.650 --> 00:17:48.390
in a newspaper so he ended
up being a folk singer

00:17:48.390 --> 00:17:52.400
and always wished he
could be an editor.

00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:57.790
I mean, jumping ahead for a second,
we -- when we were reforming --

00:17:57.790 --> 00:18:02.700
in 1981, Sing Out had
not published a magazine

00:18:02.700 --> 00:18:05.300
for about 1.5 year at
that point in time.

00:18:05.300 --> 00:18:10.110
And it was clear that the staff
based in the office in New York

00:18:10.110 --> 00:18:12.500
and decided that they were
going to pull the plug.

00:18:12.500 --> 00:18:16.990
So when I showed up at the
office to load up my car to take

00:18:16.990 --> 00:18:19.300
to the Hudson River
revival that year,

00:18:19.300 --> 00:18:23.220
they said don't sell any
subscriptions because we're done.

00:18:23.220 --> 00:18:25.030
We're out of here.

00:18:25.030 --> 00:18:27.570
We're -- so when I got to
the Hudson River revival

00:18:27.570 --> 00:18:32.100
which was also an event that was
created and founded by Pete --

00:18:32.100 --> 00:18:34.430
this time his organization
[inaudible].

00:18:34.430 --> 00:18:38.290
He too me aside.

00:18:38.290 --> 00:18:43.570
He was aware of what was going
on and we sort of sat along one

00:18:43.570 --> 00:18:45.400
of the heaps of garbage up there.

00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:49.420
And he said, "You know, Mark,
somehow, some way even if we've got

00:18:49.420 --> 00:18:51.880
to mimeograph this
magazine in somebody's face,

00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:54.020
we've got to keep Sing Out going."

00:18:54.020 --> 00:18:55.950
So we took a year.

00:18:55.950 --> 00:19:01.920
We published an interim newsletter,
which we sent out to the 1800

00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:05.950 position:56%
or so remaining subscribers
[inaudible] Sing Out's mailing list,

00:19:05.950 --> 00:19:07.250
fundraising.

00:19:07.250 --> 00:19:09.210
He did a series of
concerts raising money.

00:19:09.210 --> 00:19:10.510
We paid off the old debt,

00:19:10.510 --> 00:19:12.820
and we began putting
out the magazine again.

00:19:12.820 --> 00:19:15.480
And when we did the very first
issue, now my background --

00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:19.280
I mean, I went to Penn State
University, majored in English,

00:19:19.280 --> 00:19:22.600
minored in folklore, but I
had no experience doing this.

00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:24.990
I had been working as
a union electrician

00:19:24.990 --> 00:19:28.830
for about four years
before this occurred.

00:19:28.830 --> 00:19:31.900
So when I put out my first
issue of the magazine,

00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:34.980
it was rough shall we say.

00:19:34.980 --> 00:19:40.190
I knew nothing about -- it
was much room for improvement.

00:19:40.190 --> 00:19:43.780 position:56%
But Pete came to that first board
meeting,and we had assembled a board

00:19:43.780 --> 00:19:46.020
of directors that would
run a new nonprofit

00:19:46.020 --> 00:19:48.810
that we had created
to publish Sing Out.

00:19:48.810 --> 00:19:52.770
And they were all musicians, and
Pete came to that first meeting

00:19:52.770 --> 00:19:57.920
and like steam was coming out of
his ears because he hated the fact

00:19:57.920 --> 00:20:03.440
that I had put type on top of the
block print that he had procured

00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:07.290
to do the front cover of Sing
Out and didn't like how some

00:20:07.290 --> 00:20:09.420
of the things were edited
and how they were laid out.

00:20:09.420 --> 00:20:12.060
And he said, "Here's my idea.

00:20:12.060 --> 00:20:14.500
What we're going to do is
we're going to rent a truck,

00:20:14.500 --> 00:20:16.740
and we're going to load all
the file cabinets and a couple

00:20:16.740 --> 00:20:18.890
of desks in theback of the truck.

00:20:18.890 --> 00:20:21.020
And you're going to
drive from city to city.

00:20:21.020 --> 00:20:23.640
In each city, you're going to
roll off the back of the truck

00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:27.110
and people will walk by and will
say what are you doing in there?

00:20:27.110 --> 00:20:30.270
And then you'll say we're
doing a folk music magazine.

00:20:30.270 --> 00:20:33.320
Would you like to help?"

00:20:33.320 --> 00:20:34.620
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick:
That's Pete all right.

00:20:34.620 --> 00:20:37.220
&gt;&gt; Mark Moss: And I said, Pete,

00:20:37.220 --> 00:20:41.600
if you want to do that,
you can do that.

00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:43.040
But I'm not doing that.

00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:48.680
And luckily there were other people
on the board at that time who stood

00:20:48.680 --> 00:20:54.140
up for me and Pete quit the
board for I think the first of --

00:20:54.140 --> 00:20:58.960
in my tenure a half dozen times
over the course of that --

00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:02.200
the 30 or so years
until Pete passed.

00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:03.500
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: I think
Pete's father would have done

00:21:03.500 --> 00:21:05.150
that if it had been him.

00:21:05.150 --> 00:21:07.910
Charlie would have done that,
driven around in a truck.

00:21:07.910 --> 00:21:09.210
&gt;&gt; Mark Moss: Yeah, yeah.

00:21:09.210 --> 00:21:10.510
Absolutely.

00:21:10.510 --> 00:21:11.810
I have no doubt that
Pete would have done it

00:21:11.810 --> 00:21:15.570
if he didn't have those pesky
tour commitments and things.

00:21:15.570 --> 00:21:21.920
But getting back to the history of
things, so when Sing Out revived

00:21:21.920 --> 00:21:29.950
in 1950, this was sort of like the
beginning of the Hugh Act period

00:21:29.950 --> 00:21:34.990
of what was going on here, and
pretty much everybody affiliated

00:21:34.990 --> 00:21:39.920
with Peoples Artists ended up
getting either named or subpoenaed

00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:43.030
or questioned or blacklisted,

00:21:43.030 --> 00:21:48.460
and in one way it created a
comaraderie amongst people,

00:21:48.460 --> 00:21:57.260 position:56%
and the growth of people that were
involved in Peoples Artists and Sing

00:21:57.260 --> 00:22:01.560
Out in those days grew to
include people like Norman Lear

00:22:01.560 --> 00:22:10.920
and of course Paul Robson came back
briefly out of exile and was sort

00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:14.410
of worshipped amongst the
staff at Sing Out and stuff.

00:22:14.410 --> 00:22:20.660
But careful looking would see
that while the first seven'ish,

00:22:20.660 --> 00:22:22.040
almost eight years of Sing

00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:27.260 position:56%
Out included a Peoples Artist
publication underneath the mast head

00:22:27.260 --> 00:22:33.420
and as theownership, it disappeared
by the end of the 1950's and sort

00:22:33.420 --> 00:22:38.820
of quietly Peoples Artists
ceased to exist and Irwin Silber

00:22:38.820 --> 00:22:45.490
who was not a musician himself but
certainly not a performing musician

00:22:45.490 --> 00:22:51.980
but a pretty able organizer

00:22:51.980 --> 00:22:58.690
and entrepreneur took ownership
and took over Sing Out.

00:22:58.690 --> 00:23:04.960
He also had partial involvement or
[inaudible] had partial involvement

00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:09.360
in ownership in Sing Out during
those days, though that sort of --

00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:11.440
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: [Inaudible]
ran [inaudible]'s recordings,

00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:18.150
which are now -- it was taken over
by the Smithsonian in the late 70's

00:23:18.150 --> 00:23:19.450
and now Smithsonian [inaudible].

00:23:19.450 --> 00:23:24.060
&gt;&gt; Mark Moss: And then as
the 50's came to a close,

00:23:24.060 --> 00:23:29.130
Irwin also started a publishing
company called Oak Publications,

00:23:29.130 --> 00:23:34.610
which was responsible
for many of most

00:23:34.610 --> 00:23:40.000
of the real important
collections and instruction books

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:43.010
and song books and stuff.

00:23:43.010 --> 00:23:47.120
So he -- Sing Out would
share offices with --

00:23:47.120 --> 00:23:53.670
on and off from the mid 50's
up until the late 1960's

00:23:53.670 --> 00:23:56.310
with some combination of
[inaudible] Publications, whatever.

00:23:56.310 --> 00:24:05.660 position:56%
In 1965, Irwin who had already begun
doing a lot more overt political

00:24:05.660 --> 00:24:09.750
writing had decided that
the ship had kind of sailed

00:24:09.750 --> 00:24:16.340
from folk music being a way to
make his political statement

00:24:16.340 --> 00:24:18.910
and kind of receded from it.

00:24:18.910 --> 00:24:24.930
He sold Oak Publications to music
sales and ended up selling Sing

00:24:24.930 --> 00:24:30.960
Out separately to a cooperative
of people including Manny Solomon

00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:37.770
of Vanguard, Mo, Howard
Leventhal, Pete, and they formed

00:24:37.770 --> 00:24:42.070
yet another corporation that
was putting out a magazine

00:24:42.070 --> 00:24:47.030
that was now starting off
saddled with about a $20,000 debt

00:24:47.030 --> 00:24:50.610 position:56%
because all of these people had put
money in the pot, which bought Irwin

00:24:50.610 --> 00:24:56.230
out and Irwin went off
to work for The Guardian.

00:24:56.230 --> 00:25:00.910
And [inaudible] became the
editor for about 18 months

00:25:00.910 --> 00:25:04.410
or so during that period of time.

00:25:04.410 --> 00:25:08.360
And Sing Out really
radically made a shift

00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:13.200
because Happy's orientation
was not Irwin's.

00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:17.090
Happy's orientation was much more
-- because that was really --

00:25:17.090 --> 00:25:21.790
it was right after Happy's tenure
when I discovered the magazine.

00:25:21.790 --> 00:25:30.430
So he was much more into being
excited by the connection

00:25:30.430 --> 00:25:35.170
of traditions into contemporary
and sort of the evolution

00:25:35.170 --> 00:25:37.390
of the folk process
and that kind of stuff

00:25:37.390 --> 00:25:44.130 position:56%
that had always been the dressing of
what Sing Out was, but the politics

00:25:44.130 --> 00:25:48.830
of it sort of took a
different role in the --

00:25:48.830 --> 00:25:53.480
in what the magazine was doing.

00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:58.580
So Happy tried to keep things
going for a couple of years

00:25:58.580 --> 00:26:05.070
and then what we had was a
series of semi catastrophies

00:26:05.070 --> 00:26:11.230 position:56%
and financial difficulties mostly
having to do with the financial debt

00:26:11.230 --> 00:26:16.650
that they had during this point
in time while they were putting

00:26:16.650 --> 00:26:26.490
out sort of a glorified fanzine
in an era that was not a DIY era.

00:26:26.490 --> 00:26:31.190
So while Sing Out during
its most prominent era --

00:26:31.190 --> 00:26:36.430
period during those early
1960's years leading

00:26:36.430 --> 00:26:40.010
up to Irwin being disenchanted
had its --

00:26:40.010 --> 00:26:43.580
its subscription base
had risen to I think --

00:26:43.580 --> 00:26:46.620
it's difficult to tell
because everybody lies

00:26:46.620 --> 00:26:52.360
on their second class distribution
that they post in the magazine

00:26:52.360 --> 00:26:54.950
but it seemed to be
somewhere between about 12,000

00:26:54.950 --> 00:26:59.300
and 15,000 copies were being
printed at its highest moment

00:26:59.300 --> 00:27:02.930
up to that point in time.

00:27:02.930 --> 00:27:07.530
But by the time the early
70's had rolled around,

00:27:07.530 --> 00:27:11.930
it had shrunk back again to down
to just a couple of thousand,

00:27:11.930 --> 00:27:16.920
and it was difficult to figure
out how to continue doing it.

00:27:16.920 --> 00:27:19.060
The format of the magazine changed.

00:27:19.060 --> 00:27:22.020
They tried in the mid 1970's.

00:27:22.020 --> 00:27:26.100
They issued a flexi disk in
every other issue of the magazine

00:27:26.100 --> 00:27:28.560
that included just the
first verse and chorus

00:27:28.560 --> 00:27:30.590
of the songs that were
being printed.

00:27:30.590 --> 00:27:35.330
But there was a lot of editorial
turnover during that period of time

00:27:35.330 --> 00:27:37.680
so would go for like
a couple of issues

00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:39.750
where it would be very
much connected,

00:27:39.750 --> 00:27:43.030
and there'd be thematic issues
were put out for instance

00:27:43.030 --> 00:27:45.530
in the bicentennial year
that were each talking

00:27:45.530 --> 00:27:47.530 position:56%
about different immigrant traditions

00:27:47.530 --> 00:27:51.090
or Native American cultures
and stuff like that.

00:27:51.090 --> 00:27:52.940
And then there were
other periods of times

00:27:52.940 --> 00:28:00.420
where it took a very pointed dive
toward the uber political and what

00:28:00.420 --> 00:28:04.290
that ended up doing was the
audience that was there,

00:28:04.290 --> 00:28:06.170
the people who were showing

00:28:06.170 --> 00:28:10.050
up for the politics would go why
are you covering this other stuff?

00:28:10.050 --> 00:28:11.350
And the people that were showing

00:28:11.350 --> 00:28:17.590
up for traditional music were
saying what do you mean Puerto

00:28:17.590 --> 00:28:20.560
Rican independence?

00:28:20.560 --> 00:28:27.880
So they continued to have
problems which led up to the end

00:28:27.880 --> 00:28:33.730
of the 1970's -- 1980
was the final issue

00:28:33.730 --> 00:28:38.590
that the New York team
put out as a magazine.

00:28:38.590 --> 00:28:39.890
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: It's
interesting because it kind

00:28:39.890 --> 00:28:43.100
of shows two different
ways in which politics

00:28:43.100 --> 00:28:45.850
and music interact in a magazine.

00:28:45.850 --> 00:28:48.580
So you're talking about
people wanting

00:28:48.580 --> 00:28:52.910
to cover overtly political things
like Puerto Rican independence,

00:28:52.910 --> 00:28:55.920
but at the same time that shift

00:28:55.920 --> 00:29:01.740
in the bicentennial [inaudible]
immigrant cultures was a political

00:29:01.740 --> 00:29:04.140
thing in the United
States at that time,

00:29:04.140 --> 00:29:06.130
though not perceived as political.

00:29:06.130 --> 00:29:08.080
For the most part,
perceived as cultural.

00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:11.070
So Sing Out was covering
both of those things,

00:29:11.070 --> 00:29:12.910
and you're saying it was
maybe a little uncomfortable

00:29:12.910 --> 00:29:15.630
for the audience?

00:29:15.630 --> 00:29:16.930
&gt;&gt; Mark Moss: Yeah.

00:29:16.930 --> 00:29:22.030
I mean, look, when we went
through that period of time in 1982

00:29:22.030 --> 00:29:24.930
when Pete and I were editing that
newsletter and we were asking

00:29:24.930 --> 00:29:28.930
for input about what do you want
Sing Out to be going forward kind

00:29:28.930 --> 00:29:34.850
of discussion, ultimately what
we found out was is that the base

00:29:34.850 --> 00:29:37.580
of people that we had that
were still reading the magazine

00:29:37.580 --> 00:29:40.560
at that time were in -- were --

00:29:40.560 --> 00:29:46.090
it was sort of like five
Jews at a dinner party.

00:29:46.090 --> 00:29:47.820
There were 12 opinions.

00:29:47.820 --> 00:29:49.120
And --

00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:50.930 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: No, you're wrong.

00:29:50.930 --> 00:29:59.450
&gt;&gt; Mark Moss: So ultimately
we decided two main things.

00:29:59.450 --> 00:30:04.180
I mean, we as this
forming board came together

00:30:04.180 --> 00:30:05.910
to create the nonprofit
that would go

00:30:05.910 --> 00:30:08.790
on to publish Sing Out since then.

00:30:08.790 --> 00:30:13.050
Was first and foremost
was we wanted Sing

00:30:13.050 --> 00:30:17.300
Out to be a folk music
magazine connecting traditional

00:30:17.300 --> 00:30:22.200
and contemporary folk music
and looking at how it interacts

00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:27.830
with our every day lives and helped
people make that music a part

00:30:27.830 --> 00:30:31.060
of how they did the
things that they did.

00:30:31.060 --> 00:30:34.640
But music was going to be
the driving force behind it.

00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:42.940
We would look to the music
first and follow the politics

00:30:42.940 --> 00:30:46.100 position:56%
that are always coupled and inherent

00:30:46.100 --> 00:30:53.910
in what true community vernacular
orally transmitted music is

00:30:53.910 --> 00:30:59.430
because by its very nature,
if you're regionally trying

00:30:59.430 --> 00:31:06.070
to celebrate your culture, you
are making a political statement

00:31:06.070 --> 00:31:13.750
in a day and age that doesn't
honor that and doesn't celebrate

00:31:13.750 --> 00:31:21.060
that in that kind of a way.

00:31:21.060 --> 00:31:28.840
But the second part of it is, to be
fair, is we weren't sort of trying

00:31:28.840 --> 00:31:31.660
to be fair or balanced
about our politics either.

00:31:31.660 --> 00:31:37.280
We have a history of coming out
of leftist political movements.

00:31:37.280 --> 00:31:39.870
And that's where we stayed.

00:31:39.870 --> 00:31:47.940
So -- but by -- I think by
shifting that focus by deciding

00:31:47.940 --> 00:31:52.650
that the magazine was going to
always try to be a smorgasbord

00:31:52.650 --> 00:31:57.180
to a certain extent and
to include some politics,

00:31:57.180 --> 00:32:00.540 position:56%
some stuff about just the community,
some stuff about the history

00:32:00.540 --> 00:32:04.950
of music, some stuff about how to
play the music, in each issue --

00:32:04.950 --> 00:32:09.150
and try to do that -- we were
able to retain that membership

00:32:09.150 --> 00:32:13.710
and build our subscriber
base again by the late 80's,

00:32:13.710 --> 00:32:18.770
early 90's back up to about 15,000.

00:32:18.770 --> 00:32:25.410
Now, of course, that was the 1990's
and the beginnings of the internet.

00:32:25.410 --> 00:32:27.780
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: In the meantime,

00:32:27.780 --> 00:32:30.360
the office had moved
to Pennsylvania, right?

00:32:30.360 --> 00:32:31.660
&gt;&gt; Mark Moss: Right.

00:32:31.660 --> 00:32:39.550
After the 1981 Hudson River
revival, some friends of mine

00:32:39.550 --> 00:32:43.060
and I rented a U-Haul
truck, drove up to New York,

00:32:43.060 --> 00:32:46.030
parked across the street
from 505 Eighth Avenue

00:32:46.030 --> 00:32:52.660 position:56%
where we were subletting -- Sing Out
was subletting 2.5 rooms from WBAL,

00:32:52.660 --> 00:32:56.810
the Pacifica radio station in New
York, and we loaded up the truck

00:32:56.810 --> 00:33:00.480
like to the ceiling with
all the magazines, books,

00:33:00.480 --> 00:33:02.190
recordings, file cabinets.

00:33:02.190 --> 00:33:05.920
And then I went out, got in the
truck and tried to pull out,

00:33:05.920 --> 00:33:09.980
but the entire back of the
truck was on the wheels.

00:33:09.980 --> 00:33:15.590
So we went and rented another
truck and emptied out the one

00:33:15.590 --> 00:33:18.660
into the other one, and
we moved to Pennsylvania.

00:33:18.660 --> 00:33:21.430
At that point in time, we really
didn't know what was going on.

00:33:21.430 --> 00:33:24.750
We just knew we couldn't
continue to pay rent to WBAI

00:33:24.750 --> 00:33:28.360
because we were months
in arrears at that point.

00:33:28.360 --> 00:33:34.810
We owed the printer about
$12,000 which in 1982 money was --

00:33:34.810 --> 00:33:36.110
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick:
Pretty substantial, yeah.

00:33:36.110 --> 00:33:37.520
&gt;&gt; Mark Moss: Pretty substantial.

00:33:37.520 --> 00:33:39.300
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: And
so you went down to --

00:33:39.300 --> 00:33:41.740
where you're originally
from -- to Easton?

00:33:41.740 --> 00:33:46.030
&gt;&gt; Mark Moss: I grew up in the
Lehigh Valley so we went to Easton,

00:33:46.030 --> 00:33:50.700 position:56%
unloaded the truck into the basement
of my friend's bicycle shop,

00:33:50.700 --> 00:33:54.930
you know Genesis Bicycles
still there if you want to --

00:33:54.930 --> 00:33:59.570
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Give
them business, yes.

00:33:59.570 --> 00:34:05.510 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Mark Moss: And then like a little
over a year after that in December

00:34:05.510 --> 00:34:11.770
of 1982, we published a final
issue of the newsletter and said

00:34:11.770 --> 00:34:15.910 position:56%
that we would be -- in the spring we
would be putting out the first issue

00:34:15.910 --> 00:34:20.590
of a new revitalized Sing Out
published by Sing Out Corporation,

00:34:20.590 --> 00:34:28.040
this new nonprofit that we
had formed and then we set

00:34:28.040 --> 00:34:32.280
up an office upstairs from a
friend of mine's woodworking shop

00:34:32.280 --> 00:34:35.980
and got ready and put
that first issue out.

00:34:35.980 --> 00:34:39.840
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: And then you
moved again many years later

00:34:39.840 --> 00:34:42.570
into your building
in Bethlehem, right?

00:34:42.570 --> 00:34:43.870
&gt;&gt; Mark Moss: Yeah.

00:34:43.870 --> 00:34:45.170
We've moved twice.

00:34:45.170 --> 00:34:50.160
We moved to another place in
Bethlehem about five years later

00:34:50.160 --> 00:34:54.220
and then about four years after
that, we purchased a property

00:34:54.220 --> 00:34:59.290
on Fourth Street in Bethlehem,
and we set things up there.

00:34:59.290 --> 00:35:03.590 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: You have a
resource center and a library and --

00:35:03.590 --> 00:35:07.400
a library in a resource
center and offices there?

00:35:07.400 --> 00:35:08.700
&gt;&gt; Mark Moss: Yeah.

00:35:08.700 --> 00:35:15.290
Pretty soon after we formed a new
nonprofit, the mission as I sort

00:35:15.290 --> 00:35:19.950
of loosely mentioned of the new
corporation was the preserving

00:35:19.950 --> 00:35:25.530 position:56%
and encouraging traditional
contemporary folk music, that stuff.

00:35:25.530 --> 00:35:32.110 position:56%
And but shortly after we had created
the bylaws for the organization,

00:35:32.110 --> 00:35:36.370
we knew that the magazine was
just going to be sort of one arm

00:35:36.370 --> 00:35:39.680
of what we were trying
to do to do the work

00:35:39.680 --> 00:35:46.080
that was ultimately the
mission, and we very quickly

00:35:46.080 --> 00:35:51.080
because there was a bunch of stuff
that we had moved from New York

00:35:51.080 --> 00:35:53.100
that was interesting, we decided

00:35:53.100 --> 00:35:56.400
that we would also create a
collection or a resource center,

00:35:56.400 --> 00:35:59.070
not trying to compete with
something like the library

00:35:59.070 --> 00:36:05.020
because we were really
trying to include access

00:36:05.020 --> 00:36:11.420
to commercially released material,
not so much archival material

00:36:11.420 --> 00:36:16.590
that -- but to try to create
a collection of recordings,

00:36:16.590 --> 00:36:23.340
photographs, magazines, books and
[inaudible] that had been part

00:36:23.340 --> 00:36:27.670
of the process of making Sing
Out for the previous 30 years.

00:36:27.670 --> 00:36:32.010
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Maybe just take
a minute to look at some images

00:36:32.010 --> 00:36:34.760
and maybe, Steve, if you could --

00:36:34.760 --> 00:36:36.060
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Oh, sure.

00:36:36.060 --> 00:36:37.360
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Run that.

00:36:37.360 --> 00:36:41.060
While Steve -- I has about a dozen
images of Sing Out over the years,

00:36:41.060 --> 00:36:45.590
but I did want to ask you about the
fact that from the very first --

00:36:45.590 --> 00:36:50.010
actually Peoples Songs, there have
always been songs included both

00:36:50.010 --> 00:36:54.030
music and text, and a
really impressive list.

00:36:54.030 --> 00:37:00.750
Just in the 50's alone
Sing Out was the journal

00:37:00.750 --> 00:37:05.470
that introduced most Americans
to things like [inaudible],

00:37:05.470 --> 00:37:07.910
16 Tons, Pretty Boy Floyd.

00:37:07.910 --> 00:37:09.660
This Land is Your Land
was first printed

00:37:09.660 --> 00:37:13.550
in Sing Out in the 1953 edition.

00:37:13.550 --> 00:37:16.620
Roll On Columbia, Putting
on the Style,

00:37:16.620 --> 00:37:18.250
Michael Rolled the Boat Ashore.

00:37:18.250 --> 00:37:21.370 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Mark Moss: The very first issue
of Sing Out, which is what gave Sing

00:37:21.370 --> 00:37:23.770
Out it's name was to have --

00:37:23.770 --> 00:37:25.070
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Which
comes from where?

00:37:25.070 --> 00:37:28.490
&gt;&gt; Mark Moss: To have a song
actually If I Had a Hammer as --

00:37:28.490 --> 00:37:32.330
which was subsequently
recorded by Peter, Paul and Mary

00:37:32.330 --> 00:37:33.850 position:56%
and that's how the name got changed.

00:37:33.850 --> 00:37:36.700
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: And it was written
by Lee Hayes and Pete Singer.

00:37:36.700 --> 00:37:38.020
&gt;&gt; Mark Moss: Lee Hayes
and Pete Singer.

00:37:38.020 --> 00:37:41.200
And the third verse which
was if I had a song,

00:37:41.200 --> 00:37:45.780
I'd sing out for freedom,
for justice.

00:37:45.780 --> 00:37:51.260
So that's where Sing
Out got its name from,

00:37:51.260 --> 00:37:56.150
and its always been an essential
aspect of what Sing Out is,

00:37:56.150 --> 00:38:03.600
which is why probably I would
guess that even during my tenure

00:38:03.600 --> 00:38:08.910
at least 75 percent of Sing
Out readers were musicians,

00:38:08.910 --> 00:38:13.680
not necessarily most of the
time not professional musicians,

00:38:13.680 --> 00:38:16.540
but people who liked making
music, not just reading

00:38:16.540 --> 00:38:18.160
about music or consuming music.

00:38:18.160 --> 00:38:21.900
And that was a big part of what --

00:38:21.900 --> 00:38:31.740 position:56%
of how we framed our mission was do
it, and then not to like go on stage

00:38:31.740 --> 00:38:35.530
and get the spotlights and the
mics in front of you but to do it

00:38:35.530 --> 00:38:38.420
in your kitchen when you're
putting your baby to sleep

00:38:38.420 --> 00:38:42.090
when you're doing your dishes,
when you're working in the garden,

00:38:42.090 --> 00:38:46.830
when you're getting together with
friends to have music be a part

00:38:46.830 --> 00:38:50.570
of how you socially interact.

00:38:56.090 --> 00:38:58.260
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: This
is Peoples Songs.

00:38:58.260 --> 00:39:04.670 position:56%
This is the first anniversary issue?

00:39:04.670 --> 00:39:05.970
&gt;&gt; Mark Moss: Right.

00:39:05.970 --> 00:39:11.040 position:56%
And there you could see Paul Robson
towering in the middle there with --

00:39:11.040 --> 00:39:17.210 position:56%
and with a number of the other
people who were involved in the Sing

00:39:17.210 --> 00:39:22.520 position:56%
Out staff during that point in time.

00:39:22.520 --> 00:39:27.290
I think it's Betty Sanders
[inaudible] stage left.

00:39:27.290 --> 00:39:29.620
Your right.

00:39:29.620 --> 00:39:39.690 position:56%
And so that was some of the
propulsion that happened in that era

00:39:39.690 --> 00:39:46.110
of -- I mean, those early years
were really -- so I've heard --

00:39:46.110 --> 00:39:53.970 position:56%
were quite exciting as far as --
Sing Out wasn't just plotting along.

00:39:53.970 --> 00:39:58.390
It was growing and growing with
each subsequent issue as you look

00:39:58.390 --> 00:40:01.750
over those early issues in the
magazine, it was really interesting

00:40:01.750 --> 00:40:07.350
to see it grow in the number of
pages and the breadth of coverage.

00:40:07.350 --> 00:40:09.070
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Yeah,
this is a early --

00:40:09.070 --> 00:40:12.830
this actually was in the mid 60's?

00:40:12.830 --> 00:40:14.130
&gt;&gt; Mark Moss: This was --

00:40:14.130 --> 00:40:15.430
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: '65.

00:40:15.430 --> 00:40:18.150
&gt;&gt; Mark Moss: 1965.

00:40:18.150 --> 00:40:25.480
One of the things that we found in
our collection when we were moving

00:40:25.480 --> 00:40:29.230
from New York, I mentioned that
because you can see Johnny Cash

00:40:29.230 --> 00:40:35.020 position:56%
on the cover there, there was a
quite famous dressing down that Sing

00:40:35.020 --> 00:40:37.230
Out editor Irwin Silber did to --

00:40:37.230 --> 00:40:40.260
as an open letter to Bob Dillon

00:40:40.260 --> 00:40:44.620
after Dillon had plugged
in at Newport.

00:40:44.620 --> 00:40:48.320
But it wasn't -- it's
like sort of a misnomer

00:40:48.320 --> 00:40:51.650
that it was the folks seen getting
pissed off with him for plugging

00:40:51.650 --> 00:40:54.630
in because that wasn't
Irwin's thing at all.

00:40:54.630 --> 00:40:59.380
Irwin was dressing down for
abandoning his politics.

00:40:59.380 --> 00:41:05.840
And subsequent to that because
this was right around the time

00:41:05.840 --> 00:41:11.650
that Dillon had gone to
Nashville and had begun --

00:41:11.650 --> 00:41:13.730
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: With the
recording [inaudible].

00:41:13.730 --> 00:41:17.340
&gt;&gt; Mark Moss: He met Johnny Cash,
and they became good friends.

00:41:17.340 --> 00:41:18.860
It was also around the time

00:41:18.860 --> 00:41:26.370
that Johnny Cash shall we say was
experiencing the 1960's version

00:41:26.370 --> 00:41:29.050
of drug abuse.

00:41:29.050 --> 00:41:35.020
So he had handwritten a -- on
notebook paper a six page letter

00:41:35.020 --> 00:41:40.370
to Bob Dillon that I think
what this was in response to --

00:41:40.370 --> 00:41:45.060
Sing Out during this point in time
would regularly maybe every couple

00:41:45.060 --> 00:41:48.660
of years do what they called a
symposium where they would reach

00:41:48.660 --> 00:41:54.370
out to a number of people in --
that were musicians or scholars

00:41:54.370 --> 00:42:00.080
or forklorists in the folk music
community and pose a question

00:42:00.080 --> 00:42:04.320 position:56%
to them, and each person would write
back with like a little paragraph

00:42:04.320 --> 00:42:08.320
or set of paragraphs
about something.

00:42:08.320 --> 00:42:13.030
And I think Johnny's
response back was meant

00:42:13.030 --> 00:42:16.050
as a response to a symposium.

00:42:16.050 --> 00:42:17.600
I don't really know for sure,

00:42:17.600 --> 00:42:21.900
but I can't imagine why else he
would think to send such a thing

00:42:21.900 --> 00:42:27.070
to Sing Out, but it was
barely comprehensible stream

00:42:27.070 --> 00:42:32.180
of consciousness, bizarre
like -- letter to Johnny Cash.

00:42:32.180 --> 00:42:33.480
I'm sorry.

00:42:33.480 --> 00:42:41.980
Letter from Johnny Cash to Bob
Dillon essentially telling him

00:42:41.980 --> 00:42:49.300
to stay the course and that he
loved his new stuff and that sort

00:42:49.300 --> 00:42:52.690
of fighting back against
Irwin's thing.

00:42:52.690 --> 00:43:03.100
Now, Dillon to this day still has
a craw or a thorn in his claw,

00:43:03.100 --> 00:43:06.790
whatever the correct
expression is about Sing Out.

00:43:06.790 --> 00:43:12.030
I mean, I know that in
his memoir that he put

00:43:12.030 --> 00:43:16.710
out a few years ago
he devoted half a --

00:43:16.710 --> 00:43:22.960
to talking about how he would just
carry around that issue of Sing

00:43:22.960 --> 00:43:26.620
Out because he was going
to punch Irwin Silber

00:43:26.620 --> 00:43:28.430
in the nose if there were songs --

00:43:28.430 --> 00:43:31.630
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: But Sing
Out, which was the first

00:43:31.630 --> 00:43:34.410
to really publish Dillon and
draw attention to Dillon.

00:43:34.410 --> 00:43:39.970
&gt;&gt; Mark Moss: Yeah, Broadside was
actually very early on as well,

00:43:39.970 --> 00:43:43.260
but Sing Out -- I mean, throughout
its history, Sing Out has published

00:43:43.260 --> 00:43:46.680
over 5000 traditional and
contemporary folk songs,

00:43:46.680 --> 00:43:53.430
and it was an early place where
it covered and published new songs

00:43:53.430 --> 00:44:00.370
and songs from the repertoire of
Dillon, Baez, Paxton, [inaudible],

00:44:00.370 --> 00:44:04.930
all of the stars of
what came to be known

00:44:04.930 --> 00:44:10.950
as the folk revival that inspired.

00:44:10.950 --> 00:44:14.690
It was the first place
where interviews

00:44:14.690 --> 00:44:19.300
with Mississippi John [inaudible]
published and things like that.

00:44:19.300 --> 00:44:23.400
It was really an essential
Bible for people that were

00:44:23.400 --> 00:44:25.200
in the scene during that.

00:44:25.200 --> 00:44:27.310
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: And I
think the printing of songs

00:44:27.310 --> 00:44:30.390
in the magazine is a point that
should be emphasized because it's

00:44:30.390 --> 00:44:33.840
so different from any other
music magazine in that regard

00:44:33.840 --> 00:44:36.280
and as you say, it had
to do with the fact

00:44:36.280 --> 00:44:39.410
that the readers were expected
to actually do it at some point.

00:44:39.410 --> 00:44:42.160
&gt;&gt; Mark Moss: Sing Out
was around since 1950.

00:44:42.160 --> 00:44:47.390
Broadside didn't start
until 1960, ten years later.

00:44:47.390 --> 00:44:52.080
But there was like a long, long
list of other magazines from --

00:44:52.080 --> 00:44:56.010
there was a Boston Broadside,
[inaudible] Review, [inaudible].

00:44:56.010 --> 00:45:00.710 position:56%
There were all these other magazines
that sort of erupted as part

00:45:00.710 --> 00:45:05.180
of the interest in folk
music as popular music,

00:45:05.180 --> 00:45:10.110 position:56%
but they were all consumed this, by
this, you're the stars of the music.

00:45:10.110 --> 00:45:13.380
It wasn't about sort of breaking
it down and connecting it

00:45:13.380 --> 00:45:19.010
into the history and roots
of where the music came from.

00:45:19.010 --> 00:45:27.740 position:56%
I mean, a lot of the people who were
the biggest commercial successes

00:45:27.740 --> 00:45:29.800
and stars of that period of time,

00:45:29.800 --> 00:45:36.720
even people like the Kingston Trio
were using folk music collected

00:45:36.720 --> 00:45:41.170
by folklores and stored at the
library, that they were coming

00:45:41.170 --> 00:45:46.930
in here, pouring through the
old manuscripts, arranging it

00:45:46.930 --> 00:45:51.120
and making the stuff jaunty
and like they would sing songs

00:45:51.120 --> 00:45:55.720
about people being
murdered and hung with --

00:45:55.720 --> 00:45:58.900
as [inaudible] happy sing-a-longs.

00:45:58.900 --> 00:46:02.520
But -- and sort of
almost disconnecting it

00:46:02.520 --> 00:46:07.970
from what the root is,
but there were also people

00:46:07.970 --> 00:46:10.280
like the New Lost City Ramblers

00:46:10.280 --> 00:46:16.460
which included Pete's half
brother Michael and John Kohn

00:46:16.460 --> 00:46:20.960
who were looking back to the
roots of the music and trying

00:46:20.960 --> 00:46:26.600
to preserve it in a more serious
way and that was at its crux.

00:46:26.600 --> 00:46:31.090
I mean, interestingly Sing Out
never covered Peter, Paul and Mary.

00:46:31.090 --> 00:46:33.640
The only time that they
mentioned the Kingston Trio was

00:46:33.640 --> 00:46:35.730
in a negative way.

00:46:35.730 --> 00:46:37.720
Even somebody like Burl Ives

00:46:37.720 --> 00:46:40.610
who I think mostly got the
super short [inaudible]

00:46:40.610 --> 00:46:46.460
because he named names in front
of [inaudible] so he became sort

00:46:46.460 --> 00:46:50.370
of enemy one of the staff
of Sing Out at that time.

00:46:50.370 --> 00:46:53.900
But much of the best known

00:46:53.900 --> 00:47:00.040
of the folk revival pop people
were not really covered until sort

00:47:00.040 --> 00:47:04.100
of the next generation
of people came along,

00:47:04.100 --> 00:47:07.930
and those people were often
if not always being very,

00:47:07.930 --> 00:47:12.000
very mostly inspired
by Pete and Woody.

00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:15.900
Woody was very much part
of the community of people

00:47:15.900 --> 00:47:19.370
who started Peoples Songs, but
he was already getting ill.

00:47:19.370 --> 00:47:24.280
By the time Sing Out was around,
he was already well on his way

00:47:24.280 --> 00:47:31.150
to being incapacitated, and so I
know that for decades through --

00:47:31.150 --> 00:47:36.910
more than a decade of my
tenure Woody had made --

00:47:36.910 --> 00:47:41.310 position:56%
had sent some letter to Sing Out
that somebody had found in the files

00:47:41.310 --> 00:47:44.370
at some point in time
where he said something --

00:47:44.370 --> 00:47:49.570
one little issue of
Sing Out is worth more

00:47:49.570 --> 00:47:54.890
than all the dopey dreamy garbage
dreamed up along every Broadway

00:47:54.890 --> 00:47:59.210
of this world or something along
-- quoting off the top of my head.

00:47:59.210 --> 00:48:04.770
But he was a tremendous
supporter of Sing Out

00:48:04.770 --> 00:48:07.460
and of course Harold
Leventhal who was his manager

00:48:07.460 --> 00:48:12.210
and became Pete's manager was
integrally involved in Sing

00:48:12.210 --> 00:48:15.170
Out throughout its tenure.

00:48:15.170 --> 00:48:17.620
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: I have to say
that I don't want to get too far

00:48:17.620 --> 00:48:19.950
into the weeds, but I'm
fascinated by this cover of Sing

00:48:19.950 --> 00:48:23.200
Out that we have on the screen
right now for three reasons.

00:48:23.200 --> 00:48:26.420
I mean, we're talking about
the politics of the magazine

00:48:26.420 --> 00:48:30.200
and so students at Berkeley
being the feature on the bottom

00:48:30.200 --> 00:48:32.910
but then I don't know if people
can read this because it's

00:48:32.910 --> 00:48:36.660 position:56%
in pretty small type but along the
type under the [inaudible] magazine,

00:48:36.660 --> 00:48:41.010
it says with international section,
which has its own kind of cultural

00:48:41.010 --> 00:48:43.770
but also political side
and then the photo --

00:48:43.770 --> 00:48:46.960 position:56%
the two photos of Johnny Cash and
Muddy Waters that are sort of edited

00:48:46.960 --> 00:48:49.210
to almost make it look like
they're standing next to each other

00:48:49.210 --> 00:48:52.070
on the same stage,
although they're not.

00:48:52.070 --> 00:48:55.960
&gt;&gt; Mark Moss: I think
if you [inaudible].

00:48:55.960 --> 00:48:57.260 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Okay, yeah, yeah.

00:48:57.260 --> 00:49:01.630
But still it's sort of -- all of
that has -- it's sort of political.

00:49:01.630 --> 00:49:05.480
&gt;&gt; Mark Moss: There was
no photoshop in 1965.

00:49:05.480 --> 00:49:08.510
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: So
let's advance, yeah.

00:49:10.490 --> 00:49:13.960
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Just what Sing
Out looked like in the 1970's.

00:49:13.960 --> 00:49:16.490
This is 1973.

00:49:16.490 --> 00:49:18.990
&gt;&gt; Mark Moss: Of course,
that was Aunt Molly Jackson

00:49:18.990 --> 00:49:30.970
who was a very important organizer
for UMW, United Mine Workers.

00:49:30.970 --> 00:49:35.140
There was not another magazine
during this point in time

00:49:35.140 --> 00:49:40.140
that you have been able to read
something about Aunt Molly Jackson.

00:49:40.140 --> 00:49:44.360
I mean, I'm sure there were
scholarly journals writing

00:49:44.360 --> 00:49:51.810
about her, but these were -- that's
the kind of focus that Sing Out had

00:49:51.810 --> 00:49:55.030
that there was no other
magazine that was --

00:49:55.030 --> 00:49:58.700
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Looking
back to the roots of --

00:49:58.700 --> 00:50:00.350
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: And many
of her recordings are here

00:50:00.350 --> 00:50:03.610
in our archive we should say.

00:50:03.610 --> 00:50:05.640
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: This is a reprint.

00:50:05.640 --> 00:50:11.250
This is actually '59 to
'64, which is collected.

00:50:11.250 --> 00:50:14.510
&gt;&gt; Mark Moss: Starting
in the late --

00:50:14.510 --> 00:50:16.530
in the late 1950's

00:50:16.530 --> 00:50:19.190
because especially during
the early days of Sing Out.

00:50:19.190 --> 00:50:22.260
They would do very short --

00:50:22.260 --> 00:50:24.430
they would know how many
issues they would need,

00:50:24.430 --> 00:50:25.730
and they would print them.

00:50:25.730 --> 00:50:28.070
So almost a decade into things,

00:50:28.070 --> 00:50:30.840
and they were approaching
their tenth anniversary.

00:50:30.840 --> 00:50:33.340
They decided they would
put out little pocketbooks,

00:50:33.340 --> 00:50:40.770
5.5 by 8.5 staple binded
saddle stitched pamphlets

00:50:40.770 --> 00:50:46.530
that were just songs that
were selected from Sing Out.

00:50:46.530 --> 00:50:52.340
And there were 12 that were
done that went from 1959

00:50:52.340 --> 00:50:56.000
up until 1972 actually, and we
collected them and released them

00:50:56.000 --> 00:50:57.580
in two different volumes.

00:50:57.580 --> 00:51:01.780
Now this is like from
the late 1980's.

00:51:01.780 --> 00:51:05.010
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: And for
the musicians in the room,

00:51:05.010 --> 00:51:07.130
I'll also read out the
small print on this

00:51:07.130 --> 00:51:09.530
because it's a great indication

00:51:09.530 --> 00:51:11.500
that people were really
thinking about using this.

00:51:11.500 --> 00:51:13.690
This book has been
specially bound to lie flat

00:51:13.690 --> 00:51:15.840
and stay open for easy use.

00:51:15.840 --> 00:51:18.630
People who are musicians will
know how important that can be

00:51:18.630 --> 00:51:21.800
or you can't use the book, yeah.

00:51:21.800 --> 00:51:23.100
&gt;&gt; Mark Moss: I should also mention

00:51:23.100 --> 00:51:31.510
that that book was also toward the
beginning of another sort of shift

00:51:31.510 --> 00:51:35.060
or arm in what we did with
Sing Out in the 1980's.

00:51:35.060 --> 00:51:37.100
One of the things --
those first couple

00:51:37.100 --> 00:51:39.690
of years were really
pretty much a struggle.

00:51:39.690 --> 00:51:41.830
We were just trying to
get back on our feet

00:51:41.830 --> 00:51:45.110
to get things publishing again and
sort of going through the archive

00:51:45.110 --> 00:51:48.340
and looking through some of the
old financial records and talking

00:51:48.340 --> 00:51:51.970 position:56%
to people from the early days of the
magazine, it quickly became apparent

00:51:51.970 --> 00:51:56.810
to me that at least for
the -- during the last --

00:51:56.810 --> 00:52:03.020
the 1966 to 1968 period, Sing

00:52:03.020 --> 00:52:07.760
Out was almost being wholly
supported by Oak Publications.

00:52:07.760 --> 00:52:10.030
Oak Publications was
paying its rent,

00:52:10.030 --> 00:52:15.250
and it was supplementing its
printing, and lots of issues during

00:52:15.250 --> 00:52:19.270
that time would come and there'd be
like a three or four page section

00:52:19.270 --> 00:52:21.350
in the middle of the magazine,
which would be all ads

00:52:21.350 --> 00:52:24.760
for Oak Publications
books that were paid for.

00:52:24.760 --> 00:52:30.910
So Sing Out was subsisting as a
periodical by riding on the crest

00:52:30.910 --> 00:52:36.980
of people that wanted to buy these
books of the hard sitting songs

00:52:36.980 --> 00:52:40.550
for hard hit people, and
the Vietnam song book

00:52:40.550 --> 00:52:44.420
or whatever the Oak
Publications was coming out.

00:52:44.420 --> 00:52:51.220
So we decided as a board that we
wanted to create a publishing arm

00:52:51.220 --> 00:52:54.240
for Sing Out and Sing Out
Publications was born.

00:52:54.240 --> 00:53:00.480
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: We'll get to that
in a minute with Rise Up Singing.

00:53:00.480 --> 00:53:07.770 position:56%
Let's -- is this when you started to
do inserts for -- or this is just --

00:53:07.770 --> 00:53:09.410
&gt;&gt; Mark Moss: That
was some years later.

00:53:09.410 --> 00:53:12.330
This was -- one of the
things we were doing

00:53:12.330 --> 00:53:15.500
from a promotional purpose is
we'd go to a record company.

00:53:15.500 --> 00:53:17.920
We'd say hey, we'll
run an ad for you

00:53:17.920 --> 00:53:23.370
if you give us a couple hundred
copies of a sampler for your label,

00:53:23.370 --> 00:53:26.080
which we will then use as
premium so somebody could sign

00:53:26.080 --> 00:53:29.680
up for a subscription to
the magazine for I think

00:53:29.680 --> 00:53:32.890
at the time we were still like
$18 a year or something like that,

00:53:32.890 --> 00:53:34.570
and you'll get a free CD.

00:53:34.570 --> 00:53:41.340
So it was just like a --
my little entrepreneurship.

00:53:44.030 --> 00:53:46.060
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: I just
pulled some covers

00:53:46.060 --> 00:53:49.300
to what the more contemporary
Sing Out looks like.

00:53:49.300 --> 00:53:53.710
So it went color and
full size in color.

00:53:53.710 --> 00:53:57.100
&gt;&gt; Mark Moss: We actually
didn't go quite full size.

00:53:57.100 --> 00:54:03.940
We went to a 7 and 3/4 by 9,
not 8.5 by 11 kind of size.

00:54:03.940 --> 00:54:05.240
Don't ask me why.

00:54:05.240 --> 00:54:09.980
I think [inaudible] reader was that
size, and we wanted to be cool.

00:54:09.980 --> 00:54:13.420
But newsstands hated us because
we weren't the right size to fit

00:54:13.420 --> 00:54:14.720
on the newsstand correctly.

00:54:14.720 --> 00:54:19.380 position:56%
I think Dirty Linen wrote when we
did the press release about us going

00:54:19.380 --> 00:54:23.820
from the 5.5 to 8.5 to
that size was that Sing

00:54:23.820 --> 00:54:25.910
Out is now almost as big as we are.

00:54:25.910 --> 00:54:30.520
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: That
sounds like Dirty Linen, yeah.

00:54:30.520 --> 00:54:32.820
We're very irreverent.

00:54:35.700 --> 00:54:40.130
&gt;&gt; Mark Moss: And this of course
is the final print issue of Sing

00:54:40.130 --> 00:54:43.160
Out that came out about
two years ago.

00:54:43.160 --> 00:54:44.460
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: We'll point

00:54:44.460 --> 00:54:46.040
out that this photo is
actually in our archive as well.

00:54:46.040 --> 00:54:50.380
That's a Robert Corwin photo from
his collection, and beautiful photo

00:54:50.380 --> 00:54:54.920 position:56%
of Pete Seger's banjo which says
this machine surrounds hate and then

00:54:54.920 --> 00:54:58.590
under his arm, it says and
forces it to surrender.

00:54:58.590 --> 00:55:02.440
&gt;&gt; Mark Moss: This was sort
of our tribute to Pete issue.

00:55:02.440 --> 00:55:07.840
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: He had just died.

00:55:07.840 --> 00:55:09.230
And this is --

00:55:09.230 --> 00:55:11.330
&gt;&gt; Mark Moss: There's our
Sing Out headquarters.

00:55:11.330 --> 00:55:16.430
If you want to come to a place
where it's filled floor to ceiling

00:55:16.430 --> 00:55:23.390
on three floors with anything
-- we have about 40,000 albums,

00:55:23.390 --> 00:55:26.640
about 5000 -- 5 or 6000 books.

00:55:26.640 --> 00:55:32.030
I think about 10,000 CD's.

00:55:32.030 --> 00:55:38.610
About nine legal size
lateral file cabinets filled

00:55:38.610 --> 00:55:44.980
with photos that's many
of the great photographers

00:55:44.980 --> 00:55:50.090
from the folk revival
area, video, even VHS.

00:55:50.090 --> 00:55:52.830
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: We have VHS here.

00:55:52.830 --> 00:55:56.490
We'll talk.

00:55:56.490 --> 00:55:59.720
And that's in Bethlehem,
Pennsylvania.

00:55:59.720 --> 00:56:03.210
This is what your online
presence looks like.

00:56:03.210 --> 00:56:07.510
This is for your resource
center, but you have a website.

00:56:07.510 --> 00:56:08.810
&gt;&gt; Mark Moss: We have a website,

00:56:08.810 --> 00:56:13.000
and since we stopped publishing
the magazine, we do news

00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:14.750
and reviews on a regular basis.

00:56:14.750 --> 00:56:20.320
We also host several blogs most
notably Murder Ballad Monday

00:56:20.320 --> 00:56:24.410
which every Monday does an
in depth sort of discussion

00:56:24.410 --> 00:56:27.000
about a traditional or
contemporary song that in

00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:29.080
which somebody gets
murdered or maimed.

00:56:29.080 --> 00:56:30.730
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: It's very popular.

00:56:30.730 --> 00:56:33.830 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Mark Moss: It's very popular, and
you can subscribe to it for free,

00:56:33.830 --> 00:56:36.090
get an RSS feed telling
you when [inaudible],

00:56:36.090 --> 00:56:46.100
and it always includes lots of
sort of academ'ish wrangling

00:56:46.100 --> 00:56:50.670
of different things about a
song, but it also includes tons

00:56:50.670 --> 00:56:55.850
of audio sources from Spotify or
Youtube of all different versions

00:56:55.850 --> 00:57:00.940
of people with doing those
songs and often there's --

00:57:00.940 --> 00:57:04.760
some of the columns will deal
with a specific murder or incident

00:57:04.760 --> 00:57:07.310
and then cover various
songs that covered it

00:57:07.310 --> 00:57:12.330
so there will be newspaper
clippings and old historical photos

00:57:12.330 --> 00:57:14.320
as well as the audio sources.

00:57:14.320 --> 00:57:20.130 position:56%
We also host a syndicated radio show
that's heard in about 30 markets

00:57:20.130 --> 00:57:25.150
across the U.S. and that also
is available as a podcast

00:57:25.150 --> 00:57:32.200
that you can subscribe to through
the website and coming this summer,

00:57:32.200 --> 00:57:37.060
the site's going to be expanding
a lot because the entire archive

00:57:37.060 --> 00:57:39.370
of Peoples Songs, Sing Out

00:57:39.370 --> 00:57:43.640
and Broadside will all be
completely digitized and available

00:57:43.640 --> 00:57:47.430
for public reading and --

00:57:47.430 --> 00:57:52.530
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: And just before we
go to questions, I wanted to point

00:57:52.530 --> 00:57:58.570
out I think the next
slide is Rise Up Singing.

00:57:58.570 --> 00:58:01.570 position:56%
Can you talk a little bit about this
because this has been kind of --

00:58:01.570 --> 00:58:09.020
become the Bible for singing
groups throughout the country.

00:58:09.020 --> 00:58:12.750
&gt;&gt; Mark Moss: As I was mentioning
earlier about the board deciding

00:58:12.750 --> 00:58:17.580
that we wanted to create a
publishing arm very early on.

00:58:17.580 --> 00:58:20.630
One of the things that we
used to do is there was a --

00:58:20.630 --> 00:58:27.040
there was a folk music
fake book that was released

00:58:27.040 --> 00:58:32.740
without anybody's permission called
Wins of the People that included --

00:58:32.740 --> 00:58:40.210
it was put together by a group of
Quakers from the Philadelphia area

00:58:40.210 --> 00:58:43.630
and included everything
from Broadway show tunes,

00:58:43.630 --> 00:58:50.120
Beatles tunes to child ballads,
classic weaver's material

00:58:50.120 --> 00:58:53.000
and old time music and
all kinds of stuff.

00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:56.390
It was -- that book
was about 750 songs.

00:58:56.390 --> 00:59:00.900
And we -- I went to the people
who I knew had published

00:59:00.900 --> 00:59:03.040
that original book
because Sing Out used to --

00:59:03.040 --> 00:59:05.520
that used to be a premium
that Sing Out would offer.

00:59:05.520 --> 00:59:08.420
If you subscribe to Sing Out, you
can have a copy of [inaudible],

00:59:08.420 --> 00:59:10.840
and we always sold it
at the Sing Out booth.

00:59:10.840 --> 00:59:13.440
So I went to them and
said what do you think?

00:59:13.440 --> 00:59:17.880
If we went and we got
permission from the writers

00:59:17.880 --> 00:59:21.510
for the copywritten material that
would be in there to do a book

00:59:21.510 --> 00:59:24.190
like this so we could
do it above ground?

00:59:24.190 --> 00:59:29.740
And we ended up making a
list of about 1400 songs

00:59:29.740 --> 00:59:32.590
of which we got permission where --

00:59:32.590 --> 00:59:36.000
about half of the materials
in the public domain

00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:39.080
and the other half is
copywritten material that we went

00:59:39.080 --> 00:59:42.160
to either the musicians or
the publishers and agreed --

00:59:42.160 --> 00:59:44.960
and they either agreed to
donate the songs to Sing

00:59:44.960 --> 00:59:51.860 position:56%
Out to help us do the book or took a
most favored nation tiny [inaudible]

00:59:51.860 --> 00:59:54.120
to allow us to do it.

00:59:54.120 --> 00:59:57.760
So ultimately the book
has 1200 songs.

00:59:57.760 --> 01:00:02.450
It's broken up into sections
like by subject matter

01:00:02.450 --> 01:00:05.830
and then alphabetically within
that and it's just lyrics

01:00:05.830 --> 01:00:07.970
and guitar chords and
the idea was --

01:00:07.970 --> 01:00:11.140
I mean, very much a part of
our mission and why we saw it

01:00:11.140 --> 01:00:13.390
as being the perfect
first book for us

01:00:13.390 --> 01:00:16.450
to do was we wanted
everybody to sing.

01:00:16.450 --> 01:00:18.360
When you get together, but a lot

01:00:18.360 --> 01:00:21.720
of times people didn't know
what the lyrics to stuff was

01:00:21.720 --> 01:00:24.440
and they didn't have it
in a compact kind of a way

01:00:24.440 --> 01:00:30.750
so we did this book spiral
bound and we market -- and --

01:00:30.750 --> 01:00:35.610
took us about three years of prep
work to secure all the permissions

01:00:35.610 --> 01:00:40.100
and to do the typesetting and the
editing and stuff to put together.

01:00:40.100 --> 01:00:44.050
And this -- I think
it came out in 1987.

01:00:44.050 --> 01:00:46.920
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Not all the
issues of it are spiral bound

01:00:46.920 --> 01:00:49.800
because I've got one of the
regular bound ones and again --

01:00:49.800 --> 01:00:53.910
&gt;&gt; Mark Moss: We had a
publishing distribution deal

01:00:53.910 --> 01:00:58.240
with both a book publisher
and a music trade distributor,

01:00:58.240 --> 01:01:01.180
and they both insisted
that they knew better

01:01:01.180 --> 01:01:03.150
and that it needed to have a spine.

01:01:03.150 --> 01:01:07.400
So -- but Peter Blood
and Annie Patterson

01:01:07.400 --> 01:01:11.240
who were the brainchildren
behind the project knew

01:01:11.240 --> 01:01:15.400 position:56%
that the way people used it was they
wanted it to be flat or to be able

01:01:15.400 --> 01:01:19.480
to fold it back on itself when you
were using it in this kind of way.

01:01:19.480 --> 01:01:23.200
So that was always the main
way that we printed the book,

01:01:23.200 --> 01:01:26.560
but there were perfect bound
versions of it that were put

01:01:26.560 --> 01:01:30.710
out for maybe like the first -- we
even did like a hard bound version

01:01:30.710 --> 01:01:33.570
of it, which was completely
useless because it doesn't --

01:01:33.570 --> 01:01:35.000
it just doesn't stay open.

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.330
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: However, it's
helpful for libraries like ours

01:01:37.330 --> 01:01:39.280
where its got to be on a shelf
and people have to see it.

01:01:39.280 --> 01:01:41.250
So I guess there's a place for it.

01:01:41.250 --> 01:01:42.550
&gt;&gt; Mark Moss: There is that.

01:01:42.550 --> 01:01:45.170
But we were making it
to be in people's --

01:01:45.170 --> 01:01:50.070
the front pocket in people's guitar
cases, not on library shelves.

01:01:50.070 --> 01:01:52.200
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: And I have
to say I've been to many,

01:01:52.200 --> 01:01:56.240
many community things all over
the place that use this book

01:01:56.240 --> 01:02:00.130
because it's so handy to
have the words and chords

01:02:00.130 --> 01:02:02.200
for all these songs together.

01:02:02.200 --> 01:02:04.570
&gt;&gt; Mark Moss: We --
there are a little

01:02:04.570 --> 01:02:07.460
over 800,000 copies
of this book in print.

01:02:07.460 --> 01:02:10.420
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: And
[inaudible] subsequent book.

01:02:10.420 --> 01:02:11.720
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick:
Hey, look at that.

01:02:11.720 --> 01:02:15.180
&gt;&gt; Mark Moss: We -- Peter and Annie
did this book with Hal Leonard.

01:02:15.180 --> 01:02:19.790
We were not involved in it because
this book came out sort of already

01:02:19.790 --> 01:02:22.150
when we were beginning
to enter the --

01:02:22.150 --> 01:02:25.560
our latest extreme
financial distress period.

01:02:25.560 --> 01:02:28.530
But we do sell the
book on our website.

01:02:28.530 --> 01:02:34.830
And this is another 1200 songs
that weren't in the other book.

01:02:34.830 --> 01:02:37.800
So if you buy one,
you need the other.

01:02:37.800 --> 01:02:39.760
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: So Rise Up
really has become a Bible

01:02:39.760 --> 01:02:44.360
for public community
singing in this country.

01:02:44.360 --> 01:02:48.080
So we can go on and on because you
just have so many great stories,

01:02:48.080 --> 01:02:52.320
but perhaps we can take a couple
of questions from the audience.

01:02:52.320 --> 01:02:53.620
Questions?

01:02:53.620 --> 01:02:55.430
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick:
Is there a roving mic

01:02:55.430 --> 01:02:56.890
for the -- is there a wireless mic?

01:02:56.890 --> 01:03:00.510
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: We'll
repeat their question.

01:03:00.510 --> 01:03:06.870
[ Inaudible ]

01:03:06.870 --> 01:03:11.150
Your funding.

01:03:11.150 --> 01:03:12.450
&gt;&gt; Mark Moss: Me.

01:03:12.450 --> 01:03:21.130
Well, Sing Out -- even though we
are a nonprofit, a 501c3 charity,

01:03:21.130 --> 01:03:27.700
we're an educational institution
as we're officially called.

01:03:27.700 --> 01:03:34.080
We've never brought in more than
about 15 percent of our income

01:03:34.080 --> 01:03:37.460
from contributions, and the rest
is either from subscriptions

01:03:37.460 --> 01:03:46.690 position:56%
or book sales or other work that
we've done through advertising sales

01:03:46.690 --> 01:03:50.570
in the magazine when we were
still publishing the magazine

01:03:50.570 --> 01:03:51.870
and that kind of stuff.

01:03:51.870 --> 01:03:55.240
Of late, if you know where
our income is, please tell me.

01:03:55.240 --> 01:04:00.380
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: But you
would take contributions.

01:04:00.380 --> 01:04:01.740
&gt;&gt; Mark Moss: Yes, we do.

01:04:01.740 --> 01:04:05.220
We have done some grant
writing over the years.

01:04:05.220 --> 01:04:10.190
We received a small
-- some small support

01:04:10.190 --> 01:04:13.370
from the NEA in the early 1990's.

01:04:13.370 --> 01:04:16.040
There was an organization called
the [inaudible] Foundation,

01:04:16.040 --> 01:04:19.230
which I don't think still exists.

01:04:19.230 --> 01:04:26.020
But they provided the initial
seed money that allowed us

01:04:26.020 --> 01:04:28.460
to begin shelving, indexing

01:04:28.460 --> 01:04:33.960
and cataloging the resource
center in the late 1980's.

01:04:33.960 --> 01:04:40.680
And the Pennsylvania Council on
the Arts has been supportive,

01:04:40.680 --> 01:04:43.570
[inaudible] and there's also some
other smaller private foundations

01:04:43.570 --> 01:04:46.120
that we've gone to.

01:04:46.120 --> 01:04:48.720
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Other questions?

01:04:50.510 --> 01:05:29.240
[ Inaudible ]

01:05:29.240 --> 01:05:31.240
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: So the
question is how technology

01:05:31.240 --> 01:05:36.270
and particularly the internet have
affected folk music, journalism

01:05:36.270 --> 01:05:41.300 position:56%
and publishing and whether that's
impacting Sing Out do you think more

01:05:41.300 --> 01:05:44.900
than other magazines
that are still surviving?

01:05:44.900 --> 01:05:50.440
&gt;&gt; Mark Moss: Well, it's
dramatically affected it

01:05:50.440 --> 01:05:54.380
because for the most part even
people that say that they love Sing

01:05:54.380 --> 01:05:58.940
Out I would be willing to
bet that a large number

01:05:58.940 --> 01:06:00.370
of them don't have a clue

01:06:00.370 --> 01:06:06.760
that we haven't put a
magazine out since late 2014.

01:06:06.760 --> 01:06:13.390
So because people are getting
their information from all kinds

01:06:13.390 --> 01:06:17.170
of other places, they
know they like our mission

01:06:17.170 --> 01:06:21.540
and they support the idea of Sing
Out, but they're not really willing

01:06:21.540 --> 01:06:24.820
or interested in paying
for it anymore.

01:06:24.820 --> 01:06:30.690
Whether it be Youtube,
Spotify, Apple Music,

01:06:30.690 --> 01:06:36.440
you don't need a reviewer to
tell you when a new record is out

01:06:36.440 --> 01:06:39.430
or what you think of it
because you can listen to it

01:06:39.430 --> 01:06:41.710
and make a decision for yourself.

01:06:41.710 --> 01:06:48.960
Now, as a nearly life-long music
journalist, I don't think that that

01:06:48.960 --> 01:06:56.000
that works as well for a number of
different reasons including none

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.880
of these online sources
provide you information

01:06:58.880 --> 01:07:01.930
about who the musicians are
that are playing, who wrote

01:07:01.930 --> 01:07:07.030
or didn't write the material, what
the history of the material is,

01:07:07.030 --> 01:07:11.580
often the lyrics are
inaccessible and unavailable.

01:07:11.580 --> 01:07:18.550
But at the end of the day,
I've got a reality that's based

01:07:18.550 --> 01:07:20.950
on several different things.

01:07:20.950 --> 01:07:24.650
The -- in the early 2000's,

01:07:24.650 --> 01:07:31.980
Sing Out's largest newsstand
distributor went belly up.

01:07:31.980 --> 01:07:37.020
These were people that were
distributing in Border's books

01:07:37.020 --> 01:07:40.130
as well as many other distribution.

01:07:40.130 --> 01:07:44.870
I would say probably 2/3 of our
distribution was sold in that way.

01:07:44.870 --> 01:07:47.000
Now we were already
in a circumstance

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:52.670
where if we turned a profit
from material that was sold

01:07:52.670 --> 01:07:55.780 position:56%
on the newsstand, it was a surprise.

01:07:55.780 --> 01:07:57.360
It was more advertising

01:07:57.360 --> 01:08:00.680
that hopefully somebody would see
an issue of Sing Out at a Border's

01:08:00.680 --> 01:08:02.240
and pick it up and
then they'd subscribe

01:08:02.240 --> 01:08:03.630
and then we can make some money

01:08:03.630 --> 01:08:07.390
because by the time there was
a 50 percent wholesale discount

01:08:07.390 --> 01:08:11.820
and then there was -- we had to pay
to ship it there and shelving fees

01:08:11.820 --> 01:08:13.420 position:56%
and all these other kinds of things,

01:08:13.420 --> 01:08:16.110
we were barely getting
enough money just to pay

01:08:16.110 --> 01:08:18.170
for the printing of the magazine.

01:08:18.170 --> 01:08:24.310
What would happen was is that
part of the industry like --

01:08:24.310 --> 01:08:29.690
it evaporated in a protracted way.

01:08:29.690 --> 01:08:34.120
So when they went belly
up, they stiffed us

01:08:34.120 --> 01:08:38.620
for a significant five figure
amount of money, which I suppose

01:08:38.620 --> 01:08:43.070
if you're building casinos or big
giant buildings with T's on them

01:08:43.070 --> 01:08:45.680
or something, $50,000
isn't a lot of money,

01:08:45.680 --> 01:08:49.780
but that was like a huge
amount of money for us.

01:08:49.780 --> 01:08:56.050
And it created a cycle that
forced us into other kinds

01:08:56.050 --> 01:08:58.870
of decisions and things
that went on.

01:08:58.870 --> 01:09:03.110
The UK magazines had a completely
different distribution model

01:09:03.110 --> 01:09:09.080
where distributors in the UK buy
the magazines and then resell them.

01:09:09.080 --> 01:09:12.730
We put -- everything that was on
newsstands was consignment for us.

01:09:12.730 --> 01:09:15.290
So when we got stiffed,
not only were we stiffed

01:09:15.290 --> 01:09:18.580
for like what didn't sell, we
were stiffed for what did sell.

01:09:18.580 --> 01:09:22.650
So it wasn't just that money

01:09:22.650 --> 01:09:24.980
that we thought was coming
in stopped coming in.

01:09:24.980 --> 01:09:30.400 position:56%
It was that money that we put out
of pocket wasn't getting reimbursed.

01:09:30.400 --> 01:09:34.760
And that set a number of
other things in motion

01:09:34.760 --> 01:09:38.000
that just weren't recoverable
for us.

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.380
This is also -- we're
also in a situation

01:09:40.380 --> 01:09:43.870
where Sing Out's a
folk music magazine.

01:09:43.870 --> 01:09:48.950
I mean, I wish that the publisher
of Newsweek was sitting next to me.

01:09:48.950 --> 01:09:51.350
It would help me make this case.

01:09:51.350 --> 01:09:56.430
But people share -- not only
are these direct music resources

01:09:56.430 --> 01:10:00.530
out there that if you want to
go and search them to find them,

01:10:00.530 --> 01:10:06.770
but Facebook, Myspace, Youtube,
all these places where people,

01:10:06.770 --> 01:10:09.310
the social networking stuff.

01:10:09.310 --> 01:10:13.820
So if I hear some music and I like
it, I share it with all my friends.

01:10:13.820 --> 01:10:22.580
So the response ended up -- and
there was also the emergence

01:10:22.580 --> 01:10:30.640
of content information web
development so that many

01:10:30.640 --> 01:10:35.380
of our writers like yourself,
people are writing reviews for us

01:10:35.380 --> 01:10:37.360
or writing articles for us,

01:10:37.360 --> 01:10:39.480
they just created their
own Wordpress site,

01:10:39.480 --> 01:10:42.580
and they published it themselves
and they have control over it.

01:10:42.580 --> 01:10:44.750
So there's like a ton
of those things.

01:10:44.750 --> 01:10:48.430
Now some of them we've been able
to entice those people to come

01:10:48.430 --> 01:10:52.230
and network under the Sing Out
umbrella, but many of them go well,

01:10:52.230 --> 01:10:53.530
why do I want to do that?

01:10:53.530 --> 01:10:57.040
I'll just do it myself.

01:10:57.040 --> 01:10:59.060
[ Inaudible ]

01:10:59.060 --> 01:11:00.540
&gt;&gt; That is kind of
a question, though,

01:11:00.540 --> 01:11:03.780
whether the internet then
provides any kind of opportunity

01:11:03.780 --> 01:11:05.470
for an organization like Sing Out.

01:11:05.470 --> 01:11:08.980
We've talked about the blogs like
[inaudible] Monday that get put

01:11:08.980 --> 01:11:10.590
under the Sing out umbrella.

01:11:10.590 --> 01:11:13.330
Does that help Sing Out
at all do you think?

01:11:13.330 --> 01:11:14.630
And can other --

01:11:14.630 --> 01:11:20.720
&gt;&gt; Mark Moss: Well, it
does -- here's the thing.

01:11:20.720 --> 01:11:28.220 position:56%
We monthly receive about 50,000
unique hits on the Sing Out website.

01:11:28.220 --> 01:11:32.740
These are people coming to read
news, reviews, blogs, other things.

01:11:32.740 --> 01:11:36.150 position:56%
But these are people that are coming
there and they're doing it for free.

01:11:36.150 --> 01:11:42.710
And converting that into a way of
beig able to generate the income,

01:11:42.710 --> 01:11:47.430
even the pay for the basic
costs of running the website,

01:11:47.430 --> 01:11:53.570
the annual subscription fee
and the SSL certificates

01:11:53.570 --> 01:11:57.770
and renewing our URL's
and things like that is --

01:11:57.770 --> 01:12:00.160
that money's got to
come from some place.

01:12:00.160 --> 01:12:05.690
Not to forget the fact that
when we're publishing reviews

01:12:05.690 --> 01:12:09.890
that are written by somebody
as somebody that's coming

01:12:09.890 --> 01:12:13.570 position:56%
from a tradition of worker's rights,
I don't like running the stuff

01:12:13.570 --> 01:12:15.470
and not being able to pay people.

01:12:15.470 --> 01:12:20.730
So we were trying to pay a small,
infinitesibly small amount of money

01:12:20.730 --> 01:12:23.710
to somebody who writes a review
and puts it on the Sing Out site,

01:12:23.710 --> 01:12:25.280
but there's not a way
of making that happen.

01:12:25.280 --> 01:12:29.630
Now, what we're hoping
to do going forward,

01:12:29.630 --> 01:12:32.170
I mentioned that there's
a digitizing project

01:12:32.170 --> 01:12:37.320
which is underway now that's going
to make available the complete run

01:12:37.320 --> 01:12:41.600
of Sing Out, Peoples Songs and
Broadside, we're going to put

01:12:41.600 --> 01:12:44.380
that behind amost pay wall that --

01:12:44.380 --> 01:12:48.480
for a subscription basis of
$1.99 a month or something

01:12:48.480 --> 01:12:50.990
like that you get access
to all of it for as long

01:12:50.990 --> 01:12:55.530
as you're a member kind of a thing,
and if there's enough support

01:12:55.530 --> 01:13:00.320
for that to occur, we can
maybe look toward expanding it.

01:13:00.320 --> 01:13:03.160 position:56%
Now at the end of the day, I know it
doesn't really answer your question

01:13:03.160 --> 01:13:06.350
because you don't like
computers and --

01:13:06.350 --> 01:13:11.730
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Maybe on that
note because we want to end --

01:13:11.730 --> 01:13:13.840
we have to wrap pretty soon.

01:13:13.840 --> 01:13:17.740
Where would one go online
to find out about Sing Out?

01:13:17.740 --> 01:13:19.190
&gt;&gt; Mark Moss: Singout.org.

01:13:19.190 --> 01:13:20.490
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Okay.

01:13:20.490 --> 01:13:25.310 position:56%
I want to thank Mike Moss for coming
and for a really interesting talk.

01:13:25.310 --> 01:13:26.610
And thank you all for coming.

01:13:26.610 --> 01:13:29.010
&gt;&gt; Mark Moss: Thank you.
