Modern movie fans are a breed of their own,
but superhero movie fans are even more dedicated.

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:15.790
That means they want to know about every plot
point, character, or twist ending - even the

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:19.680
ones that weren't filmed. They're not all
game-changers, but sometimes, it's the scenes

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.160
that DON'T make the cut that sound the most
interesting. Here are Screen Rant's&nbsp;10 Amazing

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:25.160
Superhero Movie Scenes You've Never Seen.

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:36.140
The Dark Knight Rises
Even before fans got to see Heath Ledger's

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:42.170
take on the Joker, the filmmakers knew they
had a star villain. As a result, they came

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:48.880
up with several ways to give the Joker a cameo
in the third and final movie in the trilogy.

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:52.989
When Ledger passed away before the film released,
Christopher Nolan scrapped the plan out of

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:56.990
respect. But the novelization of the movie
contains what was probably the plan, revealing

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:00.899
Joker to be the sole inmate of the new Arkham
Asylum.

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.350
Man of Steel
The villains of Zack Snyder's alien title

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.570
fight were also expected to get even more
time to shine. In the original script, Zod

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:13.270
was going to arrive to Earth, and drop his
lieutenant Faora into downtown Shanghai, and

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:17.459
the overgrown Nam-Ek into another foreign
capitol. But knowing that Metropolis was going

00:01:17.459 --> 00:01:24.380
to be devastated by the Kryptonian forces,
destroying two more cities seemed like overkill.

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:29.280
The Incredible Hulk
In Marvel's first Avengers team-up, Bruce

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.249
Banner lets a serious secret drop, admitting
that he had tried to commit suicide to end

00:01:33.249 --> 00:01:40.240
his struggle with the Hulk inside of him.
The line is actually a reference to the original

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.069
opening of The Hulk's second solo movie, where
Bruce headed to the arctic to end his life

00:01:44.069 --> 00:01:48.149
the same way - the kind of opening scene that
would have set a completely different tone

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:53.990
for the rest of the movie.

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:58.479
The Avengers
Easily the best deleted scene from Marvel's

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:02.999
team-up, Captain America was originally going
to be given his own introduction, after his

00:02:02.999 --> 00:02:08.289
solo movie led directly to The Avengers. Fans
would have seen how lonely and out of place

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:11.599
he had become, in need of a new mission and
new purpose in the Marvel Universe, not to

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:18.810
mention what would probably have been comic
legend Stan Lee's greatest cameo to date.

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:25.890
Iron Man 3
Iron Man's third outing was as much a comedy

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:34.160
as a superhero movie, but one of the film's
best gags was left on the cutting room floor.

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.580
Audiences only get a brief glimpse of the
Miss Chatanooga Christmas Pageant before the

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:42.380
scene cuts to Tony sneaking between firemen
and camera crews into a TV van. What fans

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:47.350
missed was the contestant's clumsy answer
reducing her and the crowd to tears... well,

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:51.140
actually, it was the tear gas Tony was pumping
into the theatre to cause the distraction

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:52.140
he needed.

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:53.140
Man of Steel
Once Krypton's fate is sealed, the Superman

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:54.140
origin story follows his spaceship to America's
heartland, before suddenly jumping decades

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.183
into the future. But audiences were originally
going to get to see even more of young Superman,

00:02:56.183 --> 00:02:57.183
in a scene that took a baby Kal-El to a doctor's
office for a routine hearing test. The high

00:02:57.183 --> 00:02:58.183
pitched sounds caused him to scream and shatter
all the windows in the building, which would

00:02:58.183 --> 00:02:59.183
have been good for a laugh, but the tone seemed
too light considering the planet's destruction

00:02:59.183 --> 00:03:00.183
in the scene before.

00:03:00.183 --> 00:03:01.500
Thor: The Dark World
No Thor fan will forget seeing the god of

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:06.010
thunder's mother, Frigga being killed in the
second solo movie, sacrificing her life to

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:11.410
protect her son's true love and putting up
a serious fight beforehand. But in the original

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:15.371
version, Thor's father Odin was going to be
the one to blame, refusing to hand over the

00:03:15.371 --> 00:03:20.060
Aether the Dark Elves were seeking, and ignoring
his wife's pleas to kill her captors. It would

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:23.970
have been a strange choice, but a pointless
one: Odin is removed from the throne by the

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:28.590
end of the movie, anyway.

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:29.590
The Dark Knight Rises
As dark as the movies may have been, Christian

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:30.590
Bale's Batman still had a sense of humor.
Fans would have gotten another gag when he

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:31.590
rescues John Blake, and the detective asks
how he always arrives just in time. He claims

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:32.590
it's because he plants tracking beacons in
all his allies' necks while they sleep, leaving

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:33.590
Blake - and fans - to wonder if it's just
a joke, or an actual explanation for his perfect

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:34.590
timing.

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:35.590
Avengers: Age of Ultron
As soon as the movie hit theaters, Avengers

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:39.441
fans had one question: what was up with Thor
and the pool of water in that cave? In the

00:03:39.441 --> 00:03:43.790
original cut of the movie, Thor was actually
possessed by one of the fates, revealing Ultron

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:52.420
to be after the Mind Stone, one of the six
Infinity Stones being gathered for the Infinity

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:57.290
War sequels. Eventually the scene was replaced
with a quick vision, leaving Thor's actions

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:02.620
soon after a bit of a mystery.&nbsp;

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:07.100
Deadpool
The unexpected interest in a Deadpool movie

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:11.220
was mainly due to the script turned in by
Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick, which apparently

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:15.010
included a community of assassins placing
bets on who would be the first of them to

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:19.930
die on the job. Deadpool instead put his money
on Amy Winehouse, with the English singer

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:24.300
constantly shown avoiding death by inches
throughout the movie. Since the singer passed

00:04:24.300 --> 00:05:24.759
away in 2011, it's safe to assume the subplot
was removed entirely.

00:05:24.759 --> 00:05:28.699
Those are some of our favorite deleted or
scrapped scenes from superhero movies, but

00:05:28.699 --> 00:05:32.430
which ones do you know of that we missed?
