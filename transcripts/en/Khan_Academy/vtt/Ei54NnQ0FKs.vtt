00:00:00.699 --> 00:00:01.627
Voiceover:Let's say you're studying

00:00:01.627 --> 00:00:02.900
some type of a little hill

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:05.107
or rock formation right over here.

00:00:05.107 --> 00:00:06.628
And you're able to figure
out the dimensions.

00:00:06.628 --> 00:00:08.251
You know that from this
point to this point

00:00:08.251 --> 00:00:10.355
along the base, straight
along level ground,

00:00:10.355 --> 00:00:11.711
is 60 meters.

00:00:11.711 --> 00:00:13.722
You know the steeper side,

00:00:13.722 --> 00:00:15.795
steeper I guess surface or edge

00:00:15.795 --> 00:00:17.370
of this cliff or whatever you

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:19.201
wanna call it, is 20 meters.

00:00:19.201 --> 00:00:20.712
And then the longer side here,

00:00:20.712 --> 00:00:24.176
I guess the less steep
side, is 50 meters long.

00:00:24.176 --> 00:00:25.369
So you're able to measure that.

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:26.984
But now what you wanna do is use your

00:00:26.984 --> 00:00:29.106
knowledge of trigonometry,

00:00:29.106 --> 00:00:30.664
given this information,

00:00:30.664 --> 00:00:32.672
to figure out how steep is this side.

00:00:32.672 --> 00:00:34.120
What is the actual inclination

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:35.616
relative to level ground?

00:00:35.616 --> 00:00:37.257
Or another way of thinking about it,

00:00:37.257 --> 00:00:40.977
what is this angle theta right over there?

00:00:41.799 --> 00:00:42.983
And I encourage you to pause the video

00:00:42.983 --> 00:00:44.244
and think about it on your own.

00:00:45.522 --> 00:00:47.430
Well it might be ringing a bell.

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.515
Well you know three sides of a triangle

00:00:50.515 --> 00:00:52.891
and then we want to figure out an angle.

00:00:52.891 --> 00:00:54.475
And so the thing that
jumps out in my head,

00:00:54.475 --> 00:00:57.002
well maybe the law of
cosines could be useful.

00:00:57.002 --> 00:01:00.483
Let me just write out the law of cosines,

00:01:00.483 --> 00:01:02.341
before we try to apply it to this

00:01:02.341 --> 00:01:04.270
triangle right over here.

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:06.453
So the law of cosines tells us

00:01:06.453 --> 00:01:09.397
that C-squared is equal to A-squared,

00:01:09.397 --> 00:01:12.923
plus B-squared, minus two A B,

00:01:12.923 --> 00:01:16.430
times the cosine of theta.

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:17.910
And just to remind ourselves

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:20.262
what the A, B's, and C's are,

00:01:20.262 --> 00:01:23.869
C is the side that's
opposite the angle theta.

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:25.405
So if I were to draw an arbitrary

00:01:25.405 --> 00:01:27.437
triangle right over here.

00:01:27.437 --> 00:01:29.818
And if this is our angle theta,

00:01:29.818 --> 00:01:33.314
then this determines that C is that side,

00:01:33.314 --> 00:01:34.640
and then A and B could be either

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:35.728
of these two sides.

00:01:35.728 --> 00:01:37.721
So A could be that one
and B could be that one.

00:01:37.721 --> 00:01:39.368
Or the other way around.

00:01:39.368 --> 00:01:40.256
As you can see, A and B

00:01:40.256 --> 00:01:42.137
essentially have the same role in this

00:01:42.137 --> 00:01:43.257
formula right over here.

00:01:43.257 --> 00:01:46.561
This could be B or this could be A.

00:01:46.561 --> 00:01:48.139
So what we wanna do is

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:49.633
somehow relate this angle...

00:01:49.633 --> 00:01:51.841
We wanna figure out what theta

00:01:51.841 --> 00:01:54.536
is in our little hill
example right over here.

00:01:54.536 --> 00:01:55.824
So if this is going to be theta,

00:01:55.824 --> 00:01:57.513
what is C going to be?

00:01:57.513 --> 00:02:01.320
Well C is going to be this 20 meter side.

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.105
And then we could set either

00:02:02.105 --> 00:02:03.537
one of these to be A or B.

00:02:03.537 --> 00:02:05.887
We could say that this A is 50 meters

00:02:05.887 --> 00:02:08.752
and B is 60 meters.

00:02:08.752 --> 00:02:11.224
And now we could just
apply the law of cosines.

00:02:11.224 --> 00:02:13.409
So the law of cosines tells us

00:02:13.409 --> 00:02:18.584
that 20-squared is equal to A-squared,

00:02:18.584 --> 00:02:21.200
so that's 50 squared,

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:26.664
plus B-squared, plus 60 squared,

00:02:26.664 --> 00:02:31.720
minus two times A B.

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:39.440
So minus two times 50, times 60, times 60,

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:44.445
times the cosine of theta.

00:02:44.445 --> 00:02:45.539
This works out well for us

00:02:45.539 --> 00:02:46.652
because they've given us everything.

00:02:46.652 --> 00:02:48.315
There's really only one unknown.

00:02:48.315 --> 00:02:49.963
There's theta here.

00:02:49.963 --> 00:02:52.547
So let's see if we can solve for theta.

00:02:52.547 --> 00:02:56.691
So 20 squared, that is 400.

00:02:56.691 --> 00:03:03.859
50 squared is 2,500.

00:03:03.859 --> 00:03:08.668
60 squared is 3,600.

00:03:08.668 --> 00:03:11.200
And then 50 times...

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.443
Let's see, two times 50 is 100,

00:03:13.443 --> 00:03:17.803
times 60, this is all equal to 6,000.

00:03:17.803 --> 00:03:19.390
So let's see, if we simplify

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:21.524
this a little bit we're going to get

00:03:21.524 --> 00:03:27.173
400 is equal to 2,500 plus 3,600.

00:03:27.173 --> 00:03:30.355
Let's see, that'd be 6,100.

00:03:30.355 --> 00:03:31.661
That's equal to 6,000...

00:03:31.661 --> 00:03:32.565
Let me do this in a new color.

00:03:32.565 --> 00:03:38.429
So when I add these two, I get 6,100.

00:03:38.429 --> 00:03:39.148
Did I do that right?

00:03:39.148 --> 00:03:39.582
Yeah.

00:03:39.582 --> 00:03:41.390
So it's 2,000 plus 3,000, plus 5,000.

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:43.285
500 plus 600 is 1,100.

00:03:43.285 --> 00:03:50.502
So I get 6,100 minus 6,000,

00:03:50.502 --> 00:03:56.121
times the cosine of theta.

00:03:56.121 --> 00:03:57.971
And let's see, now we can subtract

00:03:57.971 --> 00:04:00.619
6,100 from both sides.

00:04:00.619 --> 00:04:04.490
So I'm just gonna subtract
6,100 from both sides

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:07.411
so that I get closer
to isolating the theta.

00:04:07.411 --> 00:04:08.739
So let's do that.

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:14.995
So this is going to be negative 5,700.

00:04:14.995 --> 00:04:15.898
Is that right?

00:04:15.898 --> 00:04:18.299
5,700 plus...

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:20.450
Yes, that is right.

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:21.899
Right, because if this
was the other way around,

00:04:21.899 --> 00:04:24.659
if this was 6,100 minus 400

00:04:24.659 --> 00:04:27.859
it would be positive 5,700.

00:04:27.859 --> 00:04:29.520
Alright.

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:31.611
And then these two of course cancel out.

00:04:31.611 --> 00:04:33.524
And this is going to be equal to

00:04:33.524 --> 00:04:39.880
negative 6,000 times the cosine of theta.

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:48.807
Now we can divide both
sides by negative 6,000.

00:04:48.807 --> 00:04:50.316
And we get...

00:04:50.316 --> 00:04:51.859
I'm just gonna swap the sides.

00:04:51.859 --> 00:04:55.907
We get cosine of theta is equal to...

00:04:55.907 --> 00:04:57.962
Let's see we could divide the numerator

00:04:57.962 --> 00:05:01.506
and the denominator by
essentially negative 100.

00:05:01.506 --> 00:05:03.474
So these are both going
to become positive.

00:05:03.474 --> 00:05:11.300
So cosine of theta is equal to 57 over 60.

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:13.879
And actually that can
be simplified even more.

00:05:13.879 --> 00:05:18.422
Three goes into 57, is that 19 times?

00:05:18.422 --> 00:05:19.342
Yep, so this is actually...

00:05:19.342 --> 00:05:20.374
This could be simplified.

00:05:20.374 --> 00:05:25.606
This is equal to 19 over 20.

00:05:25.606 --> 00:05:27.626
We actually didn't have to
do that simplification step

00:05:27.626 --> 00:05:29.552
because we're about to
use our calculators,

00:05:29.552 --> 00:05:32.993
but that makes the math
a little more tractable.

00:05:32.993 --> 00:05:36.112
Right, 3 goes into 57, yeah, 19 times.

00:05:36.112 --> 00:05:37.673
And so now we can take the

00:05:37.673 --> 00:05:39.873
inverse cosine of both sides.

00:05:39.873 --> 00:05:42.880
So we could get theta is equal to the

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:55.169
inverse cosine, or the
arc cosine, of 19 over 20.

00:05:55.169 --> 00:05:56.994
So let's get our calculator out

00:05:56.994 --> 00:05:59.994
and see if we get
something that makes sense.

00:05:59.994 --> 00:06:11.593
So we wanna do the inverse
cosine of 19 over 20.

00:06:11.593 --> 00:06:13.802
And we deserve a drum roll.

00:06:13.802 --> 00:06:18.114
We get 18.19 degrees.

00:06:18.114 --> 00:06:19.355
And I already verified that my

00:06:19.355 --> 00:06:22.282
calculator is in degree mode.

00:06:22.282 --> 00:06:25.546
So it gets 18.19 degrees.

00:06:25.546 --> 00:06:26.619
So if we wanted to round,

00:06:26.619 --> 00:06:32.515
this is approximately
equal to 18.2 degrees,

00:06:32.515 --> 00:06:35.164
if we wanna round to the nearest tenth.

00:06:35.164 --> 00:06:37.018
So that essentially gives us a sense

00:06:37.018 --> 00:06:40.892
of how steep this slope actually is.
