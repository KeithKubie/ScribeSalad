00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:26.460
So, where should we start from?

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:34.860
We need to still fix a few questions, especially
the colors of some walls.

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.960
Because as we said, you know, we would like
to have a mix of colors.

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:48.720
We want in some very important places of the
exhibition to keep the MoMA standard white,

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:55.060
because there are some places where you need
to be a little more contemplative.

00:00:55.060 --> 00:01:02.040
I think here in that section around the conceptual
series of the late '60s, early '70s, to have

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:06.140
something that would be a different nuance
of grays.

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:12.160
Or something that would be pure white and
then some very poppish colors.

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:15.040
Red, yellow, green, blue.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.020
We haven't gotten there yet, but we're trying.

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.040
We're trying to do something that's a little
bit outside of the standard grays that we

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:24.200
typically go for, so...which will be nice.

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:27.760
I think it's tough to nail it exactly.

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:28.660
Yeah.

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:34.280
It's tough to nail it, because Stephen is a
color photographer, and so we already have

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.400
a lot of colors in the show.

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:41.300
And that, in fact, was one of my concerns.

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:45.280
That's in fact what I think maybe we should
discuss today.

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.920
Bradley.

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.600
Hi.

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:28.280
Nice to meet you.

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.780
I'm Peter.

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:29.320
Hi, Peter.

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:30.380
Steven.

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:31.920
My name's Steven too.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.500
Hi.

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:33.300
I'll remember that.

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.660
Hi.

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:44.420
Hi.

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:45.100
You're right in time.

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:46.040
Right in time.

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.280
American Surfaces

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:51.880
Have I ever identified any of these people

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:52.880
for you?

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:55.360
Have I ever identified them to you?

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.860
No.

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:56.380
No, no.

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:00.800
So, this is P. Evan Sydney, who...

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.920
This I remember.

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.360
This I remember.

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:04.900
And...

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:05.840
This also.

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:09.200
Henry Geldzahler
This also. this also.

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:14.200
And this is Tony Hiss, whose father is Alger
Hiss.

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:17.760
And you have Alger's Hiss widow somewhere.

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:18.760
Yes.

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:20.960
Second row.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.860
Yes.

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.260
And that's my mother.

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:24.840
This...

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:27.400
No self-portraits in American Surfaces?

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:28.020
No.

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:29.260
I missed that one.

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:36.020
I hit all of the...what would become the Instagram
themes, but I missed the selfie.

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.880
You got the food, you got pets.

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:40.440
In fact, silly pet pictures.

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.240
Silly pet pictures.

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.840
I don't know if toilets have taken off on
Instagram.

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:45.760
No, they haven't.

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:47.200
The way that you enjoyed them, but...

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:52.360
I noticed you were a little discreet and said
that I photographed toilet seats.

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:56.980
But the toilets seats were in fact attached
to commodes.

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:04.440
See that’s a panda, and that's panda lunch,
so I think the pictures were taken at the

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:05.080
same time.

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:07.000
Let me find the panda.

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:12.820
That one is flight to New York, flight to
St. John in November of the same year.

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:14.000
Okay.

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:14.760
And this one?

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:15.840
No, not that one.

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:16.940
Where is the one with...

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:17.780
Oh, there's a...

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:22.900
That's DC, November, and this one is DC...

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:25.200
So I made two trips to do pandas?

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:27.960
I don't remember two trips.

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:32.040
Oh, look at that, it's great.

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:53.160
So, it's eight seconds.

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:59.020
I know that you found it a little too slow,
but I like it like that.

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:00.440
What's these yellow marks?

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:00.980
No.

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:01.680
That's normal.

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:03.380
That's just the tape that they put...

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:04.260
Oh, that's on the wall?

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:04.840
Yeah.

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:05.460
That's on the wall.

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:07.800
That's on the wall.

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:08.800
That's the tape that they put.

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:11.440
And I think they want it to stay there.

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:15.120
I don't know why, but they want it to check
for a few...

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:26.300
If you want it faster, of course, we can,
but I would not change it.

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:26.900
This looks okay.

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:27.980
This looks okay.

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:32.880
This is where the

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:33.840
Stupid little books

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:34.920
The Instagram

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:37.040
Oh, the Instagram or the iPads?

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:38.000
The iPads.

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:38.740
Okay.

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:42.460
So that you will have five iPads here on their
pedestals.

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:48.480
Maybe we will have a space where people can
have a look at the catalogue I'm not sure.

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:51.160
And then you will have the book suspending
from the ceiling.

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:52.160
Oh, great.

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:55.860
Yeah I’ve made the same decisions, I'm not
sure I would have made the same decisions.

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:57.100
But I thought about it more, I thought

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:03.260
I would have done a much more conservative
show, much more traditional show and a much

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:09.600
more traditional book, not because I thought
it would be better, it's because I wouldn't

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:10.800
have thought of it.

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:12.200
I wouldn't have conceived of this.

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:14.480
I wouldn't have conceived of the book.

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:18.100
That's why...

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:19.420
That's why curators are.

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:21.300
That's why curators are curators.

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:23.780
That’s the same with all the books I do.

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:32.240
If I have a new editor, I say, I want you
to be very active, come up with a...help me

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:37.460
come with a concept for the book, because
you think this is what you do and you have

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:39.860
more imagination than I do about it.

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:51.420
This is going to be a really good gallery.

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:53.240
One, first.

00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:57.680
That's a good start.

00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:27.000
So you said it's gonna be three floors?

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:28.000
Three levels.

00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:28.700
Three levels.

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:31.400
Begins on the ground floor and goes down to the Titus...

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:32.320
Wow...

00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:33.360
Towards the lobby into the club.

00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:36.380
It's like going into the club, stepping down
those steps into the club.

00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:37.540
That's the idea.

00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:39.240
That sounds like my sex life.

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:41.600
Every day of three years condensed into one...

00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:42.720
Five years, even.

00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:43.860
Yeah, five?

00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:44.500
Yeah, yeah, five years.

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:45.380
Wow.

00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:47.220
Klaus would be very impressed.

00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:53.120
Klaus would be...he would want to put his
10 cents into it, like "No, let me check,

00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:54.440
the image and..." you know.

00:07:54.620 --> 00:08:00.260
But he would...of course, he'd be very impressed,
and of course he probably also would want

00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:02.060
to make pies and cakes.

00:08:02.140 --> 00:08:03.940
Yeah, he could cater the opening.

00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:05.080
You imagine?

00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:05.960
Yeah.

00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:08.700
He would have definitely cooked his ass off
and catered the whole event.

00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:12.360
Okay.

00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:16.340
Get ready for one hell of a locker.

00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:25.760
Let's see what's in here.

00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:29.040
That's a hopsack dress.

00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:30.540
Oh this goes on and on.

00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:40.220
Who cares about Toledo?

00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:43.020
My dad's suit, suits.

00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:58.400
I used to travel with this until they banned
big suitcases.

00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:06.120
Oh, that can't be it.

00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:06.660
No.

00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:12.100
See, it's all this stuff, it's like...

00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:13.300
What the hell is all this?

00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:18.000
Okay.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:18.780
That's one.

00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:19.900
That's a...no, this is a wig.

00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:21.260
So these are all wigs.

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:21.780
All right.

00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:24.440
Is it likely to be in suitcase like that as
opposed to...

00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:25.120
You know what?

00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:28.840
I don't remember if it's in a box, something,
down here.

00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:30.760
Another crazy thing.

00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:32.500
Is it going to be on a coat hanger?

00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:33.880
No, no, no, no.

00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:37.040
It's going to be in a box or another suitcase.

00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:39.760
There's two more black cases, right?

00:09:40.780 --> 00:09:42.820
What does that say there?

00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:46.200
And this is from California, so...

00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:47.040
Oh, maybe.

00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:47.920
Okay.

00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:54.220
The cape of Klaus Nomi.

00:09:58.140 --> 00:09:58.800
That’s it.

00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:00.900
That's it?

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:02.000
That's it.

00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:04.440
Hold it up to the light, there it is.

00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:06.580
Hold it up to the light, Joey.

00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:08.820
You can see through the plastic.

00:10:08.820 --> 00:10:09.880
Yeah, that's it.

00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:10.700
Oh my gosh.

00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:13.200
The plastic cape.

00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:18.240
I got a lot of Nomi costumes in here, tons
of Nomi stuff that no one has ever seen before.

00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:23.260
It's like the head dresses and I got the wigs
that Klaus wore, whatever that...so it's all

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:24.240
in here.

00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:27.500
And we've been pestering Joey to dig this
out, to get into this closet.

00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:28.480
For about a year.

00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:30.100
We've been trying to get into this closet
for a year.

00:10:30.180 --> 00:10:31.260
We finally got into Joey's closet.

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:31.960
Right.

00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:33.360
And I was, like, not going to do it.

00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:35.140
I was like, you know what, okay, we're getting
close to this.

00:10:35.140 --> 00:10:39.160
It's going to happen, it's not going to happen,
so here it is and I'm glad it did.

00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:40.520
And this is the way to do it.

00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:41.100
Right, exactly.

00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:41.700
Do it together.

00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:42.240
With the whole crew.

00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:42.740
Yeah.

00:10:44.380 --> 00:10:46.020
This is a job.

00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:47.340
All right.

00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:48.720
Shall we start repacking?

00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:49.940
Watch your fingers.

00:10:49.940 --> 00:10:51.220
Straight ahead.

00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:55.600
Superb.

00:10:56.640 --> 00:10:57.340
Ready?

00:10:57.820 --> 00:10:59.120
We got everything we want?
