00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.497
 

00:00:01.497 --> 00:00:09.980
[SIMULATED FIREWORKS]

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:11.770
You know, chase an answer.

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:13.110
Just don't give up.

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.970
 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:24.030
I mean, I think you have to have
a love of symmetry, patterns,

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:30.170
colour, enjoyment really of what
you see and what you discover.

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:35.260
 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:36.566
My name's Judith Howard.

00:00:36.566 --> 00:00:38.190
I'm a chemical
crystallographer working

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:39.356
at the University of Durham.

00:00:39.356 --> 00:00:41.890
 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:45.210
Crystallographers come from
many different scientific

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:46.300
disciplines.

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:50.000
What we have in common is
the technique that we use

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.660
and the methodology, so
that the small samples

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:57.800
that we use-- and these
can be small crystals

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.270
of a chemical nature
or a biological nature.

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.640
And we're using
diffraction methods

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.450
to unravel the internal
structure-- in other words, how

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.740
the atoms are arranged
that make up that material.

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.150
What we derived from the
experiment are intensities.

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:17.330
So if you imagine
a wave, the height

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:19.330
of that wave as I'm
drawing it would

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:20.860
be what we call our intensity.

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:25.530
We can then work out, by the
same mathematics that they

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.530
used 100 years ago,
a Fourier series.

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:29.240
And it's the
Fourier series which

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.170
enables us to reconstruct
the electron density that's

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:34.840
inside that crystal.

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.740
And the peaks of the electron
density are the atoms.

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.850
And that is because we're
diffracting the x-rays

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:43.325
from the extra
nuclear electrons.

00:01:43.325 --> 00:01:47.380
Instead of having to calculate
each Fourier layer slowly

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:49.771
by hand, plotting it out,
carefully with contours,

00:01:49.771 --> 00:01:51.770
the structures now will
evolve before your eyes,

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:55.130
if you like, on a
computer screen.

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:59.060
Once you have the basic atomic
molecular structure, that

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:03.395
begins to open up any number
of avenues you can explore.

00:02:03.395 --> 00:02:06.355
And of course, when we started,
at least when I started,

00:02:06.355 --> 00:02:09.289
it took around about
a year to solve

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:11.750
relatively simple
molecular structure.

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:14.420
Now we can do several before
coffee in the morning.

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.760
And that's just in the lab.

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.170
I find the whole thing-- I
mean, the crystals themselves

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:21.560
are beautiful and pretty.

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.310
 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.790
The diffraction
pattern is pretty.

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.207
Because if you
actually get spots,

00:02:28.207 --> 00:02:29.289
then you've got a crystal.

00:02:29.289 --> 00:02:30.070
You've got order.

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:33.067
You've got periodic order,
which means you have actually

00:02:33.067 --> 00:02:34.400
got something you can work with.

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.483
So that's exciting, and
also, some of the patterns

00:02:36.483 --> 00:02:38.448
are really lovely.

00:02:38.448 --> 00:02:40.950
I started studying
the subject when

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:44.920
I was an undergraduate
student in the '60s.

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.420
And then I went
to Oxford to study

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:51.120
for my D.Phil with
Dorothy Hodgkin, the Nobel

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.030
Laureate and a huge
influence in my life.

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:59.860
Dorothy, of course, started
amazingly in 1934, '35,

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:01.660
to look at protein crystals.

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:03.860
They had no way of
solving the structures,

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:05.910
but they knew that if
they could get diffraction

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:08.060
from these crystals
that then some day,

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:10.770
they would eventually solve
the protein structures.

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:15.880
And Dorothy had an amazing
knack or intuition of,

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:17.690
first of all, choosing
the right problem

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:20.170
and then being able to solve it.

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:21.780
So she worked on Vitamin B12.

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:22.996
She worked on penicillin.

00:03:22.996 --> 00:03:26.020
 

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:29.450
And the insulin crystals
which she had in fact taken

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:32.650
photographs of in
the end of 1934,

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:34.730
that structure was
not solved-- published

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:39.262
until 1969, which is
an amazing 35 years.

00:03:39.262 --> 00:03:40.970
Today, people would
be expecting to solve

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:44.820
that in 35 days or less.

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:47.330
We can get to know more and
more about the structures

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:49.660
of the proteins, but
that's only the beginning.

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:52.685
It doesn't tell you how
they work necessarily.

00:03:52.685 --> 00:03:56.260
And biology's just
amazingly complex.

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.215
I mean, the way we work.

00:03:58.215 --> 00:03:59.840
And you work differently
from the way I

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:02.960
work, and the next
person and so on.

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:04.710
What's going on at
the molecular level?

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:06.010
I mean, we know a lot.

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:08.590
But there's plenty
more to find out.

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:41.536
