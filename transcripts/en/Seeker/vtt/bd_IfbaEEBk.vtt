00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.770
So, let’s just come out and say it: everybody
poops.

00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:05.580
But what happens if you don’t?

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:07.180
Constipation.

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:11.840
Hey guys, Amy with you on DNews.

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:17.340
Going poo might make all emotional 12-year-olds
giggle, but no going poo is no laughing matter.

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.109
When everything is healthy and normal, smooth
muscles in the intestines move food along

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:24.250
allowing your body to absorb nutrients and
water along the way.

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:28.230
Anything that stays in your digestive tract
long enough to reach the colon is waste, and

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.000
it’s compacted and excreted.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.609
But we all get constipated.

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:35.329
Almost everyone will experience this uncomfortable
feeling and the bloating and cramping that

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:37.389
comes with it at least once in their lives.

00:00:37.389 --> 00:00:41.920
According to the American College of Gastroenterology,
constipation is one of the most frequent GI

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:48.030
problems in the US with at least 2.5 million
poop-related doctor visits every year.

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.850
Constipation happens when your body draws
too much water out of the passing food, drying

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:53.890
out the mass as it approaches your colon.

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:56.229
The dryer your poop is, the harder it is to
pass.

00:00:56.229 --> 00:00:59.879
You might not be able to pass dry stool for
a day or two, but once it’s been three days

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.709
since your last bowel movement you’re considered
constipated.

00:01:02.709 --> 00:01:07.099
Three days is the average time it takes for
the stool in your system to get dry and hard.

00:01:07.099 --> 00:01:10.299
*** Yes, you’re still processing food so
making more poo

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:12.570
We usually get it when traveling.

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.900
The sudden change of your diet and a disruption
of your daily routine can throw your body’s

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.049
natural process into disarray.

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:20.520
Your body will want to poop, but you’re
sleeping.

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.560
Or you might be on a plane and choose to hold
it in instead of braving the airplane washroom.

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.200
Speaking of, opinions differ on the question
of holding in a poo.

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.570
Konstantin Monastyrsky, author of Gut Sense,
says holding your stool in, even once, is

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:36.340
dangerous because it allows stools to stack
on top of one another.

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:39.999
And they dry out, they block your system and
can lead to an impacted bowel.

00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:43.080
Prevention magazine, on the other hand, says
that while holding it in won’t make you

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:46.140
feel great, doing it once or twice is probably
ok.

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.159
Which is probably good since most of us will
try and hold it until we can get to a bathroom.

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.040
But making a habit of it is dangerous.

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:56.210
Kyle Staller, a gastroenterologist at Massachusetts
General Hospital says that people who are

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:59.659
in the habit of holding in their poop because
of their jobs — think nurses, teachers,

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:03.850
or long-haul truck drivers — are more likely
to become constipated or even develop dysfunction

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:05.600
in the muscles used for pooping.

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.770
And while laxatives might help, they’re
really only a short term solution.

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:12.720
Overuse of laxatives can actually cause the
muscles in your colon to forget how to form

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.010
and excrete waste.

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.080
Your body can forget how to poo!

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.700
So holding it in is bad.

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:18.700
And gross.

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.200
If you don’t poo when you need to, all the
waste and toxins your body wants to excrete

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.790
is just sitting in there.

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.730
And you continue making waste, adding to the
mass and also stopping toxins trying to get

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:28.730
out of your organs.

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:31.200
You’re slowly poisoning yourself.

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.730
The mass keeps building up in your colon,
eventually leading to an impacted bowel.

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:39.040
An impacted bowel can cause circulation problems,
heart problems, as well as horrible cramping,

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.189
a distended gut, and a lot of pain.

00:02:41.189 --> 00:02:46.110
Enemas help relieve impacted bowels, but sometimes
surgery is required, and if left untreated,

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:48.380
an impacted bowel can kill you.

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:50.220
Best defenses against constipation?

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:53.909
Eat enough fibre and drink enough water to
keep your body happy and healthy, go when

00:02:53.909 --> 00:02:55.670
you feel the need, and take your time!

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:00.409
Scientists aren’t entirely sure why, but
coffee helps you go, so try sipping that morning

00:03:00.409 --> 00:03:01.430
cup on the toilet.

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:02.640
Your colon will thank you.

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.290
