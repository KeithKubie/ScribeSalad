00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:01.920
Hey, Doug Walker here.

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:03.660
No Rob this time, so sorry.

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:05.320
He didn't make it to the screening.

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.380
But yeah, I am just going to talk about Deadpool.

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:11.220
Uh, before I talk about the movie I should

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:15.540
talk about, uh, what I know about Deadpool, which actually isn't much.

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.320
Uhh, everytime I go to a con, there's like a million Deadpools.

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:21.320
So I know he's a really popular character.

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.960
I know he's aware he's a fictional character,

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:25.680
so there's a lot of fourth wall jokes.

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:27.380
I know he's like,

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:30.720
an action hero who can't like.. or kind of an anti-hero,

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:34.700
and he does a lot of comedy because he knows he's a character.

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:41.300
And he, like, can get shot and either doesn't feel the pain or heals up or something like that.

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.560
Even then I'm still not entirely sure- And he has a thing for Chimichangas.

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:45.680
That's about all I know.

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:50.040
So in terms of like "Does this represent the source material?", whatever, I'm only guessing.

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:54.720
Uuuh, but I'm gonna come out just as a movie critic here and uh,

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:57.440
As a movie like this goes...

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:00.140
It's fine. (Laughs)

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.680
It's got some laughs, its got some good action. Uh...

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:05.320
And that's about it.

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.100
um.. I think there's a lotta hype around this movie, and...

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.340
It, in no way disappoints.

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:17.780
Uh, I think it gives you exactly what you think you're going to get,

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:19.620
and that's it.

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:24.440
Umm, and the audience I saw it with was very very excited,

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:25.640
and very happy to see it,

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:27.540
and laughing at every single joke,

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.800
and getting invested when it got dramatic. And...

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:35.800
Yeah, I sure saw it as that was fun that was enjoyable, and...

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:37.840
I never need to see it again.

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.640
It's one of those movies where I kind of thought, maybe

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:49.940
the humor was gonna be even a little bit more, if that makes sense, like... kinda like "Hot Fuzz",

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.460
Uh, you know, or "World's End" where there's just so many jokes being thrown at you,

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.720
but it's... And they're good jokes!

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:58.400
Uh, and they're good "in the moment" jokes,

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.440
and there are good fourth wall breaking jokes...

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:01.440
Umm...

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:07.780
But... yeah, I think the one weakness it has I said in my Bum Review too is that

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:13.200
when it needs to be a regular movie, like when it needs to do the dramatic stuff,

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:16.820
Uh...it's not bad by any means,

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:18.940
but it's very standard.

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:23.420
This is very much the kind of movie you see, where...

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.180
Those movies you see advertised,

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:28.480
where they always take place at night, and it's lit by street lights,

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.300
and someone's wearing a hat like this,

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:34.300
and is really musclebound and gets revenge, because somebody

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:37.360
did him wrong or kidnapped his girl or something like that,

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:40.240
or killed his dog. Some weird crap like that...

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:45.960
And I'm just going around with guns shooting guys except there's a few super heroes in it,

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.920
and fourth wall jokes, not even that many superheroes...

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.800
Weird ones that they picked too and I don't know if this ties into

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:59.020
the comic, because we have Colossus from X-Men and some other one I don't recognize.

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:02.240
She has some sort of long elaborate name, but

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:05.300
they were both really cool. Honestly this is...

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.080
I feel like this is...

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:10.900
Kinda the best X-Men movie we've gotten yet because,

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:14.900
when Colossus comes out, he's Russian, he looks like Colossus,

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:18.520
He's the size, he has the personality, he's kinda, you know,

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:22.400
(Russian accent) he's kinda nice, almost gentlemanly,

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.960
almost very simple, and that kinda felt like what Colossus was.

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:31.700
He's not just a big muscle guy who's like "I can help you" and that's it, you know?

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:34.100
He's Russian, he's all these things, and...

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:37.420
There's a scene where he's just watching T.V.

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:42.680
and the teen girl that can blow up, I forget her name, uh, not Jubilee,

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.120
A different one, much cooler one.

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:47.080
Ya know, they're just watching T.V. and he goes:

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:51.080
"Oh, we should go help" and they just go get the Blackbird and fly out.

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:54.200
I sort of felt like yeah, that's X-Men, that's comic books.

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.400
And this is very much a comic book movie.

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:01.160
Like I said, with a lot of these, breaking the fourth-wall jokes

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:03.820
And... So I like that,

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:08.460
and I like a lot of the, like I said, a lot of the humor.

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:15.800
There's a romance between Ryan Reynolds and the other lead, I don't know her name, sorry.

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:19.020
But they have legitimately good chemistry,

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:22.700
they're both kind of nutty and make these one-liners.

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:25.620
But she's not just a carbon-copy of him either.

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:27.540
Ya know, which is nice, she's her own unique character.

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:35.500
The villain's pretty standard, the side characters that help is pretty standard.

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:39.380
It's funny 'cause this movie actually opens up as the funniest opening credits.

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:42.620
Where the credits are just,

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:45.640
they don't say who the actual people are.

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:47.440
They just sort of say their roles.

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:54.200
Like, staring, ya know, "a douche-bag who's paid too much" or "the comic relief" or "a CGI character".

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:57.240
Like, they're saying all this stuff you see in a milliion movies,

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:59.520
and you're gonna see in this movie too.

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:01.300
So it's, I don't know...

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:04.540
Maybe that's kinda like the secret genius of it,

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:08.540
Is that it actually is just an unbelievably standard movie.

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:14.760
That just has such a good sense of humor that it's kind of like eh, you kinda take it.

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:18.560
But the humor doesn't go through all the way through,

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:21.440
and I don't think that's what Deadpool was, from what I understand.

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:23.780
I don't think it was one-hundred-percent comedy.

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:27.300
It is still a comic book film, it is still about revenge.

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:30.920
It is still about kicking ass and a lot of cool stunts and powers.

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:36.860
And people looking really pained and angsty and going "Nooo!"

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:39.040
Ya know, all of that stuff. So that's all in there.

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:42.920
And yeah, I guess...

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:45.960
Maybe I thought it was going to be a little bit more unique in that sense.

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:49.340
I mean, I hear Deadpool, one of his big comedic things

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:52.760
is that he constantly compares himself to other characters.

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:55.480
Like Spiderman, or Wolverine 'cause he can heal up,

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:57.280
and then Spiderman because he kinda looks like Spiderman.

00:05:58.500 --> 00:05:59.000
So...

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:01.460
maybe that's kinda the thing.

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:04.020
Maybe they kinda know they're stealing from all these other things

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:06.260
and they're kinda having fun with it.

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:10.760
Um... But if it- If it was, it was taking itself pretty seriously,

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:14.680
But, I don't know, I guess something like Darkman does something kinda similar.

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:19.440
It doesn't have fourth-wall jokes, but it's this very obvious standard plot

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:21.580
that you've seen in comic books a million times.

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:23.540
But it gives it its own unique spin.

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:27.980
So, yeah, I think when it sort of came around to being this

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:31.380
dramatic film, the part where you're supposed to really care.

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:35.200
With the exception of the romance, which surprisingly I really bought the chemistry,

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:39.520
uh, I thought everything else was just kinda standard, like I've seen it a lot.

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:42.120
There was even one or two times where I was kinda like:

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:45.080
"Yeah, okay, where's the.. can he look at the camera again."

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:48.600
But um, but it's good.

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:53.100
I guess I thought maybe I'd get something a little bigger.

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:55.860
Or even more jokes flying out at you.

00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:57.940
But I'll be honest, I'm probably

00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:00.840
really spoiled with what I thought this was gonna be.

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:05.540
Cause like I said, I mean I am kinda thinking like the Cornetto Trilogy, or Hot Fuzz or something like that,

00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:07.340
where there's just gonna be a ton of jokes.

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:11.260
Um, and there are a fair amount of jokes, and very clever jokes.

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:14.560
There's, the opening credits like I said are very funny.

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:17.840
There's a great scene where he spells out the bad guy's name, I won't give it away.

00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:20.760
Uh, some really funny one-liners.

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:24.280
Um, so, yeah it's fun.

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:28.920
It's a fun, shoot-em-up action flick with some funny lines.

00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:35.420
A butt-ton of in-jokes as you'd imagine. And... Most of 'em I got.

00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:36.480
There's one or two-

00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:39.060
Like he meets a guy who's like, his best friend,

00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:40.500
I think called Bob or something like that.

00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:42.580
And the audience just *woah* like that,

00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:44.040
and I went, "huh?"

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:46.880
And these guys in front of me were trying to tell me

00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:49.380
like, "No, it's his best friend from a while ago,

00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:50.820
he's the one that always gets him in trouble, he's the one..."

00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:53.200
I'm like "okay, okay, alright, that's...

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:57.580
You got it, you're the people that this was made for and that's what matters".

00:07:57.800 --> 00:08:00.340
And that's what I feel like, I feel like the crowd that saw this

00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:04.740
really liked it, really got into it, and really laughed at every joke.

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:07.680
And I fe- and they applauded at the end.

00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:12.580
They waited, like nobody left before the credits stopped.

00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:15.720
Everybody stayed 'cause they knew there was gonna be something at the end.

00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:20.840
So I think that's, that's the kinda people this was made for.

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:24.020
It was made for fans, it kinda feels like a fan movie.

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:27.140
I took my wife to go see it, who, y'know, she liked it fine.

00:08:27.140 --> 00:08:29.480
But there was a lot of times where she was like:

00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:31.940
"What's that? I don't know that. What does that mean? What is that?"

00:08:31.940 --> 00:08:36.640
Y'know, there's references to "Wolverine Origins", and the Stan Lee cameo.

00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:41.940
So there's all this stuff that, unless you know Marvel and comic book movies

00:08:41.940 --> 00:08:44.400
and stuff like that, you're not gonna get.

00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:47.780
This is very much, it feels like a fan film,

00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:50.380
but kind of the right kind of fan film.

00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:53.860
So, yeah, it's fun.

00:08:54.140 --> 00:08:57.920
Probably as anti-climactic of a review as you can get.

00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:01.840
I don't love it but I thought it was, y'know, I thought it was fun.

00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:03.240
It was an enjoyable film.

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:07.420
So, not much else I can say outside of that.

00:09:07.420 --> 00:09:11.060
I'm not going to do a spoiler corner 'cause there's really nothing to spoil.

00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:14.400
I mean, what you guess is gonna happen is exactly what happens.

00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:16.960
But again, that's not the kinda movie it is.

00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:21.520
It's there for the jokes, it's there to get this incredibly popular character on the big screen.

00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:24.560
And it seems like it's done well.

00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:30.000
All the cosplayers I see at cons and the way they act, they all act like this asshole.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.620
So, I'm assuming this is what the character is like.

00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:38.160
So, yeah, if uh, if you're lookin' for some good laughs,

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:43.040
and some fun action and just CG superheroes jumpin' around punching stuff.

00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:46.160
This is great, it's a lot of fun, and it's gory.

00:09:46.300 --> 00:09:50.040
And there's, y'know, it's raunchy, it definitely earns its R rating.

00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:51.900
So, um, yeah...

00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:54.160
That's about it, uh, take it for what it's worth,

00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:55.820
and I will see you later. Take care.
