00:00:00.669 --> 00:00:01.669
Vsauce!

00:00:01.669 --> 00:00:02.669
Kevin here.

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:03.669
Sailing the high seas!

00:00:03.669 --> 00:00:05.340
Avast ye, scurvy dogs!

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:07.620
Actually, I’m in a kiddie pool.

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:13.980
And you’re not scurvy dogs because scurvy
was just some weird thing pirates got or something.

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.740
Or is it a disease everyone can still get
today?

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:22.220
&nbsp;And does the centuries-long search for its
cause and cure show us how life-saving knowledge

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:26.080
can be hidden right in front of our faces?

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:27.630
Yes.

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.790
Scurvy is a disease caused by a deficiency
of ascorbic acid, commonly known as Vitamin

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:38.039
C. It’s necessary for the absorption of
iron, which fortifies red blood cell production.

00:00:38.039 --> 00:00:42.139
Red blood cells help carry oxygen from your
lungs to the rest of your body.

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:47.159
Vitamin C is also necessary for connective
tissues, muscles, tendons, blood vessels,

00:00:47.159 --> 00:00:52.399
bones, and the formation of collagen - the
glue that binds your body together.

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:55.969
&nbsp;Zombies could probably benefit from Vitamin
C.

00:00:55.969 --> 00:01:01.469
Guinea pigs are one of the only animals whose
livers don’t synthesize Vitamin C -- a shortlist

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.360
that includes some primates and all humans.

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:09.091
For us, it’s thought to be the result of
an evolutionary defect that occurred 60 million

00:01:09.091 --> 00:01:14.659
years ago, and it means we have to get Vitamin
C from someplace else - food.

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:26.329
Here are some foods that contain Vitamin C.

00:01:26.329 --> 00:01:30.479
While fresh fruits and vegetables are the
most common sources of Vitamin C, for the

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:35.369
Inuit people living in the Arctic, there’s
as much Vitamin C pound for pound in beluga

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:39.030
whale skin as there is in orange juice.

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:44.179
Scurvy is so rare today that it’s often
overlooked by doctors when patients do suffer

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:45.179
from it.

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:51.499
It takes only about 10 milligrams of Vitamin
C a day to stave off -- eight ketchup packets.

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:56.560
But in a world without cheap, pre-packaged
servings of sweet and tangy tomato goop, without

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:03.049
foods fortified with extra Vitamin C, or without
any idea that vitamins even existed, men were

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:08.229
trapped on boats for months at a time eating
salted meat, biscuits and beer.

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:14.180
A diet with a daily recommended allowance
of Vitamin C floating right around zero percent.

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:19.540
The Age Of Sail, which lasted from the late
15th to mid 19th century, was defined by European

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.350
powers exploring and warring over sea supremacy.

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:27.870
Warships grew bigger, vessels for commerce
flourished and voyages lasted longer.

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:33.360
Mortality rates at sea were so high that some
ships would leave port with up to 50% more

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:38.310
sailors than they needed to try to make up
for the deaths caused by scurvy.

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:44.450
Cannonballs, Krakens and Captain Hook can’t
compare to a deficiency of Vitamin C.

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:48.489
So what happens when you get scurvy?

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:52.180
According to the National Health Service,
scurvy is characterized by fatigue, pain in

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:58.049
the limbs, swollen gums, and the appearance
of red-blue spots on the skin… which doesn’t

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:00.049
sound too bad.

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:04.989
But according to a surgeon on a 16th Century
English voyage, symptoms can get a lot more

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:05.989
graphic.

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:09.459
“It rotted all my gums, which gave out a
black and putrid blood.

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:14.420
My thighs and lower legs were black and gangrenous,
and I was forced to use my knife each day

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:18.459
to cut into the flesh in order to release
this black and foul blood.

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:23.260
I also used my knife on my gums, which were
livid and growing over my teeth…

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:28.969
When I had cut away this dead flesh and caused
much black blood to flow, I rinsed my mouth

00:03:28.969 --> 00:03:32.430
and teeth with my urine, rubbing them very
hard…

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:38.840
And the unfortunate thing was that I could
not eat, desiring more to swallow than to

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:39.840
chew.”

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:40.840
Okay!

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:42.159
Let’s break this down.

00:03:42.159 --> 00:03:47.290
Urine, which contains ammonia, was used as
a mouthwash and teeth-whitener for centuries

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:53.370
- documented by 1st century BC Roman poet
Catullus in a verse about a rival’s beautifully-polished

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:54.370
teeth:

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:58.819
"... the higher the polish on your teeth,
the more it proclaims that you have drunk

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:00.409
your piddle."

00:04:00.409 --> 00:04:05.290
And cutting out foul blood, or bloodletting,
was a foundational tenet of medical reasoning

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:10.159
from Hippocrates in 4th Century BC Greece
through the 19th century.

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:16.209
Despite the surgeon general of The East India
Company writing in 1617 that lemon juice prevents

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:22.430
and cures scurvy, it took years for anyone
to understand why.

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:25.760
Three hundred sixteen years.

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:29.760
Before the rise of modern medicine, ailments
were thought to be treated by balancing the

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:34.390
four humors - blood, black bile, yellow bile
and phlegm.

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:39.710
The scurvy-suffering surgeon thought he had
too much blood so he performed a venesection

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:41.020
to release some.

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:44.950
Then along came Dr. Lime Tree.

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:49.790
Surgeon James Lind, whose last name derives
from the Old Norse for lime tree, performed

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:53.450
the first controlled clinical trial in human
history.

00:04:53.450 --> 00:05:00.100
While aboard the English warship HMS Salisbury
in 1747, Lind separated scurvy-afflicted sailors

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:01.630
into six pairs.

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:06.450
He then monitored the effects of treating
them with cider, a sulphuric acid cocktail,

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:10.500
vinegar, sea water, oranges and lemons, and
garlic paste.

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:15.040
Lind found that, “the most sudden and visible
good effects were perceived from the use of

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:19.840
oranges and lemons,” but without knowledge
of vitamins, he was forced to explain the

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:23.030
results through the medical worldview of his
time.

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:28.400
He concluded that the dampness at sea blocked
perspiration, which led to an imbalance of

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:29.400
alkalinity.

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:33.180
Basically, that sailors weren’t sweating
properly because they were wet all the time,

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:36.990
and acidic fruits restored the body’s internal
pH balance.

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:40.750
None of which is remotely true, but he didn’t
know that.

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:45.360
No one understood the chemistry of nutrition
- it was a different world with different

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:50.460
rules, and Lind was just trying to understand
what he observed and explain it to others.

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:52.540
But it didn’t work.

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:58.030
With no scientific understanding of how a
lemon could prevent and cure scurvy, other

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:04.070
purported remedies included mixing hydrochloric
acid into drinking water or drinking wort

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:05.070
of malt.

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:10.290
A precursor to beer promoted as a scurvy elixir
by Dublin Physician David Macbride with the

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:16.720
support of the Royal Society, wort of malt
not only contained zero Vitamin C, it actually

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:18.270
inhibited its absorption.

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:22.010
It was like giving a thirsty person a cup
of sand.

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:26.620
Despite scurvy killing over two million sailors
during the Age Of Sail, there wasn’t much

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:28.760
motivation to find a cure.

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:33.250
Ship owners were more concerned about their
expensive ships -- sailors were easier to

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:34.250
replace.

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:39.450
It wasn’t until the warship HMS Gloucester
had to be abandoned in 1742 because there

00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:43.670
weren’t enough living sailors to continue
manning it that England put effort into a

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:44.710
solution.

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:45.710
&nbsp;

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:49.820
Ships were loaded with lemon rob, a concentrate
invented by Lind which unknowingly destroyed

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:52.190
half the Vitamin C in the process.

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:56.970
Storing the rob deteriorated the Vitamin C
further over time, but it still worked well

00:06:56.970 --> 00:07:02.830
enough that in 1799, the Royal Navy ordered
a lemon and sugar cocktail to be administered

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:05.170
daily to all sailors.

00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:11.290
Scurvy plummeted, which gave the British navy
a tremendous advantage in the Napoleonic wars.

00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:15.090
Scurvy was cured!

00:07:15.090 --> 00:07:16.090
Until it wasn’t.

00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:21.830
The advent of steam engines meant shorter
trips, so the importance of lemons was seen

00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:22.950
as less critical.

00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:27.660
Lemons, which had been planted throughout
Sicily to supply the British navy, were eventually

00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:32.820
replaced in 1860 by more readily available
West Indies limes.

00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:38.400
They believed that acidity provided the cure,
and while limes are more acidic than lemons

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:40.890
they have half the Vitamin C.

00:07:40.890 --> 00:07:46.300
50 years later, further misunderstandings
of scurvy led Robert Falcon Scott’s expedition

00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:52.220
to Antarctica to not include any citrus at
all -- and the trip was such a disaster that

00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:57.070
Apsley Cherry-Garrard called it "The Worst
Journey in the World."

00:07:57.070 --> 00:08:01.870
But you didn’t have to be a sailor or an
explorer to suffer from scurvy.

00:08:01.870 --> 00:08:08.210
When baby formula became popular in the early
1900s, it contained no Vitamin C and thousands

00:08:08.210 --> 00:08:09.650
of infants died.

00:08:09.650 --> 00:08:13.460
By 1920, orange juice was mixed into the formula.

00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:17.780
Ultimately, the knowledge that fresh fruits
and vegetables cured and prevented scurvy

00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:23.750
wasn’t enough -- we needed to understand
the process that was involved.

00:08:23.750 --> 00:08:27.210
Humanity required a shot in the arm.

00:08:27.210 --> 00:08:32.180
Like, with a bullet.

00:08:32.180 --> 00:08:37.259
In 1917, in the midst of World War I, a young
Hungarian soldier named Albert Szent-Györgyi

00:08:37.259 --> 00:08:42.829
wanted to get back to the University Of Budapest
so badly he said he was, “overcome with

00:08:42.829 --> 00:08:48.589
such a mad desire to return to science that
one day I grabbed my revolver and in my despair

00:08:48.589 --> 00:08:51.129
put a shot through my upper arm.”

00:08:51.129 --> 00:08:56.339
He finished his MD later that year without
a clue that a guinea pig would lead him to

00:08:56.339 --> 00:08:58.149
a nobel prize.

00:08:58.149 --> 00:09:02.579
While studying a deficiency disorder called
Beriberi, researchers Axel Holst and Theodor

00:09:02.579 --> 00:09:07.089
Frolich decided to switch out their pigeon
test subjects for a mammal.

00:09:07.089 --> 00:09:12.769
They fatefully chose the non-vitamin-c-producing
guinea pig, which died from scurvy-like symptoms

00:09:12.769 --> 00:09:15.899
when fed a strict diet of grain.

00:09:15.899 --> 00:09:20.009
For the first time, an animal was observed
with scurvy.

00:09:20.009 --> 00:09:26.699
They honed their experiments, and by 1932
Szent-Györgyi had isolated ascorbic acid.

00:09:26.699 --> 00:09:32.740
Prior to the discovery of X-rays, the electron,
radioactivity and relativity, scientific learning

00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:35.459
was largely limited by our senses.

00:09:35.459 --> 00:09:39.480
You can see a hungry lion; you can’t see
its electrons.

00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:45.130
You can see rotten food; you can’t see if
it has Vitamin C. The constraints of medical

00:09:45.130 --> 00:09:50.220
reasoning of the era prevented James Lind
from saving millions of lives.

00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:54.850
His knowledge was imprisoned by the zeitgeist
- a German word representing the dominant

00:09:54.850 --> 00:09:59.940
ideals and beliefs of a particular period
of time.

00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:00.940
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:04.540
In his 1970 book, The Crazy Ape, Albert Szent-Györgyi
described the zeitgeist as a cage.

00:10:04.540 --> 00:10:08.660
He said, “The freedom of human thought is
very limited.

00:10:08.660 --> 00:10:14.209
We all live in a very narrow cage, the “spirit
of our times,” in which we have very limited

00:10:14.209 --> 00:10:15.829
freedom of motion.

00:10:15.829 --> 00:10:20.949
If, in different ages, people thought differently,
this was not because the cage got wider, but

00:10:20.949 --> 00:10:22.999
because the cage moved.”

00:10:22.999 --> 00:10:29.149
By discovering ascorbic acid and finally solving
a mystery that plagued humans for thousands

00:10:29.149 --> 00:10:33.529
of years, Albert Szent-Györgi moved the cage.

00:10:33.529 --> 00:10:40.170
Today, we live in a cage created by the math,
biology, chemistry, and physics of our time.

00:10:40.170 --> 00:10:45.269
And just like James Lind couldn’t conceive
the chemistry of lemons and livers -- we have

00:10:45.269 --> 00:10:48.700
a hard time moving our own cage.

00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:55.709
Albert Szent-Györgyi included a quote in
his 1957 book, Bioenergetics, that says, “Research

00:10:55.709 --> 00:11:03.110
is to see what everybody has seen and think
what nobody has thought.”

00:11:03.110 --> 00:11:08.519
In order to move our cage, we have to step
outside its confines and see things from a

00:11:08.519 --> 00:11:10.199
new perspective.

00:11:10.199 --> 00:11:15.569
Whether it’s to advance science, improve
our world or just better ourselves.

00:11:15.569 --> 00:11:21.459
Like Vitamin C and scurvy, a solution that
can revolutionize life as we know it exists

00:11:21.459 --> 00:11:26.389
just outside the limits...of our own kiddie
pool.

00:11:26.389 --> 00:11:31.829
The greatness in each of us lies in our ability
to move beyond limitations and find a way

00:11:31.829 --> 00:11:37.060
to see what everybody else has seen but think
what nobody else has thought.

00:11:37.060 --> 00:11:43.860
And the fear, complacency and obstacles in
our path are washed away as soon as the wall

00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:46.920
impeding discovery is broken down.

00:11:46.920 --> 00:12:08.439
And as always - thanks for watching.

00:12:08.439 --> 00:12:12.600
Hey I'm really excited to announce I did a
collaboration with Sesame Studios.

00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:14.709
It's a blanket fort memory game.

00:12:14.709 --> 00:12:17.990
It's for really really little future Vsauce
fans.

00:12:17.990 --> 00:12:19.930
So go over there - check it out.

00:12:19.930 --> 00:12:22.160
Make sure you subscribe while you're there.

00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:23.160
And uhh yeah.

00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:24.319
I'll see you over there in the blanket fort.

00:12:24.319 --> 00:12:25.319
Okay?

00:12:25.319 --> 00:12:25.320
Bye!
