&gt;&gt;Rich: Alright guys, thank you all for coming
and whoever is on VC thank you very much as

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.289
well.

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:23.520
I wanted to introduce you all to Dr. Jordan
Metzl.

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:27.359
He's here today to talk about his book "The
Athlete's Book of Home Remedies".

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:33.190
It's a terrific companion book for you guys
to make sure that you're not going to hurt

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:35.170
yourself like I did.

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:40.240
But he's going to be here today to talk about
all of his tricks and wizardry.

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:44.079
But I wanted to read you the dedication of
the book: "This book is dedicated to the millions

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:48.160
of athletes who wake up each morning at 5:30
with no fanfare and drag themselves out of

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:49.620
bed to keep fit.

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.239
Whatever your level or ability, may the information
in this book help you pursue your goals.

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.539
The most important thing you can do every
day is to keep moving forward."

00:00:58.539 --> 00:01:03.380
So with that and without further introduction,
I want to introduce you to, and it is his

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:08.420
birthday so please be gentle on him, Dr. Jordan
Metzl.

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:09.420
[applause]

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.110
&gt;&gt;Jordan Metzl: Thanks.

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:15.170
Rich, thanks so much and it's great to see
everybody.

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:16.170
What a cool place.

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.660
I mean I feel like I'm not nearly cool enough
to be here.

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:21.580
But it's a pleasure to be here, to be down
to Google.

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:24.459
And I take care of a lot of you guys when
you hurt yourselves, up in my office and it's

00:01:24.459 --> 00:01:29.050
a pleasure to down here and people conferenced
in out in California or wherever else you

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:32.080
are; the concept we're going to talk about
today is how to keep yourselves moving and

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.820
active and injury free.

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:38.520
So with that, I'm going to talk about this,
which is about a three year project I did

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.190
called "The Athlete's Book of Home Remedies"
the concept being that I want you to stay

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:46.020
active every day of your lives, starting now
for as long as you go.

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.330
And so we’ll talk about some of the themes
about that.

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:55.360
First thing is my website here, which is available,
for the last five years I've been doing the

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.619
medical column for Triathlete magazine.

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:01.790
Have pretty much one pagers on everything
related to running, endurance sports, anything,

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:06.009
shin splits, bonking, knee pain and those
are kind of free.

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:09.450
Also have a number of videos available on
my site, and there's a newsletter we put out

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.280
about four times a year.

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.569
We don't send your email to anybody, so no
spam, I promise.

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:16.739
Although guys' spam filter's pretty good so
I don't think it matters anyway.

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:19.120
But, certainly happy to have you guys sign
up.

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.120
There's a little registration tab.

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:21.849
I'd be happy to have ya.

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:25.200
Now, let's talk about what we're going to
talk about today.

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:30.150
And that is that exercise is very much medicine,
exercise keeps you going, exercise keeps you

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:31.550
young, it keeps you healthy.

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:32.990
And I want you to exercise every day.

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:36.260
Now, part of that is what do you do to make
that happen.

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.480
So, this is a picture of me at the Iron Man
several years ago.

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.920
I try and do one marathon and one Iron Man
a year.

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:47.330
For those of you who don't do Iron Man, you
don't have to do the Iron Man but if you're

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:52.430
interested, it's about a 2.4 mile swim, 112
mile bike ride and then a marathon.

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:55.230
And the first question is, why the hell would
you do that?

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:00.670
And the answer is that I deeply believe, number
one in goal setting and number two that basically

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:02.160
it is about meeting a goal.

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.910
Everyone needs something that pushes them
further than they think they should go.

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:10.050
And yes, fitness is a great thing to think
about in theory, but without a goal to do

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:12.930
that, it's very difficult to make yourself
take that next step.

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:17.360
So if you're goal is doing a big swim, doing
a ballroom dance competition, doing a 5k walk

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:22.150
in the park, whatever it is you wanna do,
the goal, you should set a goal for yourself.

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:24.760
So we're gonna talk about how you meet your
goal and I always have this, this is actually

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:27.150
my screen saver at work.

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:31.130
For example this morning, just to try and
get down I had about 15 patients in the office,

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:34.680
the last guy was like "dude, I've gotta go
to my thing, I'm late, come on" and started

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:35.680
yelling at my nurses.

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:39.280
Well, I don't get many of that in New York
but every once in a while I do and I then

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:43.060
I just look at this and my god, this was mile
17 of the run.

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:44.900
I'd already done the swim, the bike.

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:49.082
It was about 90 degrees, the sun was going
down and I was like I got 6 miles to go, I'm

00:03:49.082 --> 00:03:53.290
gonna finish this thing and most importantly
my brother, Jamie, who I do these with, is

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:55.880
about a mile behind me and I'm gonna beat
that guy for the first time ever.

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:59.840
So I was pretty psyched about it, and so that
was my goal.

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:03.780
And so, I think the concept of this kind of
stuff is it gives you some place in your own

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:07.730
psyche, of like I'm having a tough day at
work, I'm having a tough time in my life and

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:09.630
yet this is a goal that I've been doing.

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:11.420
So, I deeply believe in that stuff.

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:16.479
So I think the concept was actually outlined
by the Roman poet, Juvenal, many thousands

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:17.479
of years ago.

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:21.290
Who talked about, 'It should be prayed that
in the mind, the mind be sound in a sound

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:22.290
body'.

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:25.540
So, copore, 'mens sana in corpore sano', sound
mind in a sound body.

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:30.520
They go together and here in this great environment
where you guys have created such an incredible

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:36.039
workspace to be creative and think about things,
I know in the place out in California there's

00:04:36.039 --> 00:04:38.300
exercise facilities as part of what you do
out there.

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:41.520
You're all encouraged to be active and healthy,
and that's part of healthy mind.

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:45.350
And so I think these things go together very
much so I applaud you for the way you set

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:46.350
that up.

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:47.350
Let's look at the United States.

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:53.259
1985 in the United States, states reporting
10-14% obesity are in the darker blue, less

00:04:53.259 --> 00:04:54.259
than 10% in the lighter.

00:04:54.259 --> 00:05:03.069
But let's look at the United States 86, 87,
88, 89, 90, 91 now darker blue, 15-19% 92,

00:05:03.069 --> 00:05:10.650
93, 94, 95, 96, 97 now greater than 20% 98,
99, 2000, 2001 greater than 25% obesity, 2002,

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:23.740
2003, 2004, 2005 now greater than 30% obesity
in the South East, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009.

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:28.639
So basically, if you want to be thin, move
to Colorado.

00:05:28.639 --> 00:05:30.389
That's the bottom line of this.

00:05:30.389 --> 00:05:34.050
But as you can, we’ve had this march of
obesity across our country.

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:37.930
And this is an epidemic affecting everybody
and part of the problem with the way we set

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:40.389
up our health care in the United States, and
if you've been following this, we're going

00:05:40.389 --> 00:05:43.000
to hear more about this in the next day or
two from the Supreme Court.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:47.389
But we have a fundamental flaw in the way
we do business in the United States and that

00:05:47.389 --> 00:05:53.099
is that our system which spends billions of
dollars, more than you know about 15-16% of

00:05:53.099 --> 00:05:55.779
the GDP, estimated to go up 17-18%.

00:05:55.779 --> 00:05:58.039
The problem is we treat disease.

00:05:58.039 --> 00:06:02.160
So if you come in to see somebody with a heart
problem and you come in for your annual visit,

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:04.810
they put you on medication that's paid for
by your insurance company.

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:08.259
Then it goes on over time, and you need several
tests that’s paid for by your insurance,

00:06:08.259 --> 00:06:10.059
you get a catheterization, that's paid for.

00:06:10.059 --> 00:06:12.319
You eventually get open heart surgery, that's
paid for.

00:06:12.319 --> 00:06:13.849
Your cardiac rehab, that's paid for.

00:06:13.849 --> 00:06:18.210
Yet we spend almost no money paying to prevent
the problem before it happens.

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:23.370
And so we have this concept of incentivizing
disease treatment, we basically treat and

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:26.599
pay for disease, which is totally counter
intuitive.

00:06:26.599 --> 00:06:30.560
Now we do some great things in America, like
companies like this, but we do have some problems

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:31.569
in the way we think about things.

00:06:31.569 --> 00:06:37.150
In Germany, for example, if you have a cavity,
you have to go every six months to the dentist.

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:40.180
And if you have a cavity and you've been going
to the dentist every six months, the state

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:41.840
pays for your cavity.

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:44.949
If you have a cavity and you've not been going
to your annual six month checks up, you have

00:06:44.949 --> 00:06:46.210
to pay for your own cavity.

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:51.590
And so the concept of incentivizing good health
behavior makes a ton of sense, yet we really

00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:52.590
don't do it.

00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:57.419
So since our government chooses to incentivize
things like home ownership or marriage or

00:06:57.419 --> 00:07:00.839
kids, we incentivize different behaviors just
based on our tax hood.

00:07:00.839 --> 00:07:04.289
We've not, we're not at the place yet where
we incentivize wellness, though I hope we

00:07:04.289 --> 00:07:05.310
are at some point.

00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:09.020
At this point the responsibility is all of
yours and all of yours out there.

00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:14.160
And so you have to think about incentivizing
wellness because exercise is very much medicine.

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:17.930
So with that, I'm gonna show you why the case
for medicine is so significant with this great

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:21.930
video which I brought along for you guys particularly
because I know you'll appreciate how this

00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:22.930
is done.

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:27.289
So let's look at this for a couple of minutes
to then get to the basis of what the book

00:07:27.289 --> 00:07:30.529
is about.

00:07:30.529 --> 00:07:36.419
Now, on this— there it is down there.

00:07:36.419 --> 00:07:40.199
&gt;&gt;Dr. Mike Evans: Hi I'm Dr. Mike Evans and
welcome to this visual lecture I'm calling

00:07:40.199 --> 00:07:41.689
"23 and a half hours"-

00:07:41.689 --> 00:07:43.719
&gt;&gt;Jordan Metzl:--Any suggestions from back
there?

00:07:43.719 --> 00:07:49.539
Alright hold on, we're gonna, I want this
to work so badly I'm gonna just minimize this.

00:07:49.539 --> 00:07:54.190
We are having some technical issues, let's
watch this quickly on this thing.

00:07:54.190 --> 00:07:55.839
[Pause]

00:07:55.839 --> 00:08:01.889
&gt;&gt;Jordan Metzl: This will enlarge that?

00:08:01.889 --> 00:08:09.870
&gt;&gt;Mike Evans: Hi I'm Dr. Mike Evans and welcome
to this visual lecture I'm calling "23 and

00:08:09.870 --> 00:08:14.569
a half hours" So I have a big interest in
preventive medicine, you know which can mean

00:08:14.569 --> 00:08:20.020
a lot of things from cancer screening to eating
more fiber to having a good social network,

00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:25.810
and I mean that in the old sense of the word,
weighing less, drinking less, smoking less,

00:08:25.810 --> 00:08:28.589
controlling your blood pressure, cholesterol
and so on and so forth.

00:08:28.589 --> 00:08:33.339
So all these things are incredibly important,
I wouldn't want you to minimize your efforts

00:08:33.339 --> 00:08:34.750
in any one category.

00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:39.550
But I want to know what comes first, what
has the biggest impact, what has the biggest

00:08:39.550 --> 00:08:40.550
return on investment.

00:08:40.550 --> 00:08:41.550
[Cash register cha-ching]

00:08:41.550 --> 00:08:44.940
&gt;&gt;Mike Evans: What makes the biggest difference
to your health?

00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:49.290
So I did my research and I found an answer
at least for me and it's tricky, cause you

00:08:49.290 --> 00:08:51.180
know all these things are sort of overlapping.

00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:57.410
But I picked up this intervention because
of its breadth, it worked for so many different

00:08:57.410 --> 00:09:00.000
health problems and that's what I found so
cool about it.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.480
So just to kinda walk you through a quick
list, so this intervention in patients with

00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:09.360
knee arthritis who receive one hour of treatment
three times a week reduce their rates of pain

00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:12.089
and disability by 47%.

00:09:12.089 --> 00:09:18.579
In older patients, it reduced progression
to dementia and Alzheimer's by around 50%.

00:09:18.579 --> 00:09:22.660
For patients at high risk of diabetes and
coupled with other lifestyle interventions,

00:09:22.660 --> 00:09:26.839
it reduced progression to frank diabetes by
58%.

00:09:26.839 --> 00:09:31.529
Post-menopausal woman who had 4 hours a week
of the treatment had a 41% reduction in the

00:09:31.529 --> 00:09:33.500
risk of hip fracture.

00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:35.420
It reduced anxiety by 48%.

00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:41.649
In a big meta-analysis, patients suffering
from depression 30% were relieved with low

00:09:41.649 --> 00:09:47.300
dose and that bumped to 47% as we increased
the dose.

00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:52.380
Following over 10,000 Harvard alumni for over
12 years, those that had the intervention

00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:56.070
had a 23% lower risk of death than those who
didn't get the treatment.

00:09:56.070 --> 00:10:01.000
It's the number one treatment of fatigue and
of course, the kind of outcome of choice there,

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.950
my favorite outcome is called quality of life
which is really all of the above.

00:10:04.950 --> 00:10:05.950
[Ascending harp chord]

00:10:05.950 --> 00:10:06.950
&gt;&gt;Mike Evans: And really about making your
life better.

00:10:06.950 --> 00:10:10.420
And this treatment has been shown over and
over again to improve quality of life.

00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:15.050
So, the question is what's the medicine and
what is 23 and a half hours?

00:10:15.050 --> 00:10:17.079
So, the medicine was exercise, mostly walking.

00:10:17.079 --> 00:10:18.079
[High chime]

00:10:18.079 --> 00:10:20.750
&gt;&gt;Mike Evans: So not triathlons and let me
just put it a different way.

00:10:20.750 --> 00:10:26.310
What I think I'm asking you to do is if you
think about your typical day so there's 24

00:10:26.310 --> 00:10:31.850
hours and so you might spend most of your
day, you know this varies obviously, but you

00:10:31.850 --> 00:10:32.850
know couch surfing -

00:10:32.850 --> 00:10:34.149
[Boxing bell, computer keyboard keystrokes]

00:10:34.149 --> 00:10:36.230
&gt;&gt;Mike Evans: -sitting at work, obviously
sleeping.

00:10:36.230 --> 00:10:41.699
And what the evidence that I'm going to show
you kinda tells me is, the best thing you

00:10:41.699 --> 00:10:44.240
can do for your health is to spend half an
hour of being active-

00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:45.240
[Clock ticking]

00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:48.160
&gt;&gt;Mike Evans: - maybe an hour and that if
you can do that you can realize all the benefits

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:50.050
I've described in the previous slides.

00:10:50.050 --> 00:10:53.600
So let's just take a quick walk through some
of the literature.

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:58.730
So Steven Blair, he's a professor at the Arnold
School of Public Health at the University

00:10:58.730 --> 00:11:03.500
of South Carolina, and he looked at this in
what's called the Aerobic Centre Longitudinal

00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:09.259
Study, which followed over 50,000 men and
women over time and along the left side of

00:11:09.259 --> 00:11:14.569
this graph is something called Attributable
Fractions which is kinda fancy word but it's

00:11:14.569 --> 00:11:18.560
the estimate of number death in a population
that would have been avoided if that specific

00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:19.879
risk factor had been erased.

00:11:19.879 --> 00:11:25.879
So for example, turning a smoker into a non-smoker
or couch potato into a daily walker.

00:11:25.879 --> 00:11:30.519
And along the bottom is the typical risk factors,
you can see that hyper-tension's incredibly

00:11:30.519 --> 00:11:35.209
important and so on so forth, but the one
that was most, that kind of implied the most

00:11:35.209 --> 00:11:39.950
risk was this sort of mysterious CRF, which
is Cardio Respiratory Fitness, which is really

00:11:39.950 --> 00:11:40.950
low fitness.

00:11:40.950 --> 00:11:44.779
So low fitness was the strongest predictor
of death.

00:11:44.779 --> 00:11:49.940
And this important that most of the trials
we see, to be honest, are funded by Pharma

00:11:49.940 --> 00:11:54.470
or other companies because they’ve got a
drug for hypertension or high cholesterol

00:11:54.470 --> 00:11:59.319
or diabetes, we rarely see fitness thrown
into the mix and so it's nice to see a trial

00:11:59.319 --> 00:12:00.319
that's not so siloed.

00:12:00.319 --> 00:12:01.319
[Bicycle bell]

00:12:01.319 --> 00:12:07.149
&gt;&gt;Jordan Metzl: The concepts of that, the
concepts of that I think are very helpful.

00:12:07.149 --> 00:12:12.360
And I apologize if our, I may have to switch
back and forth here a couple times.

00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:18.189
This was made, our hospital does not support
iBook yet, so unfortunately I had to design

00:12:18.189 --> 00:12:19.709
on my old Dell.

00:12:19.709 --> 00:12:23.060
Alright, so, we're gonna talk about what I
do now.

00:12:23.060 --> 00:12:24.740
So hopefully I've convinced you that you gotta
move.

00:12:24.740 --> 00:12:27.170
You gotta move every day and it's gonna be
helpful for you, it's gonna be helpful for

00:12:27.170 --> 00:12:30.100
everybody around you, it's gonna be helpful
for your job, for your life for everything

00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:31.100
that you do.

00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:33.029
That you'll set some goals for yourselves
and make that happen.

00:12:33.029 --> 00:12:36.009
Now let's talk about some of the pitfalls
of what you and so that you don’t get hurt

00:12:36.009 --> 00:12:39.910
and then at the end I have promised I will
answer your injury questions.

00:12:39.910 --> 00:12:43.410
So I'm sure we have plenty of runners and
people with plantar fasciitis and iliotibial

00:12:43.410 --> 00:12:44.690
band syndrome etcetera.

00:12:44.690 --> 00:12:45.690
here.

00:12:45.690 --> 00:12:48.500
And you get to ask your questions as soon
as you're done listening to this stuff.

00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:50.140
Alright, so what's my job?

00:12:50.140 --> 00:12:54.450
Well my job is basically to make sure people
make good decisions about their fitness and

00:12:54.450 --> 00:12:55.450
activity.

00:12:55.450 --> 00:12:59.160
And I took this picture when I was out giving
a lecture in Wyoming last summer.

00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:02.529
And so I was out in Jackson, Wyoming and I
saw some bright lights down the road.

00:13:02.529 --> 00:13:03.920
And in fact there was a rodeo down there.

00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:07.000
So I walked down there and I was like alright,
well I live in New York City but I can appreciate

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.519
a good rodeo probably as much as the next
guy.

00:13:09.519 --> 00:13:12.850
And they had like the horses and the bulls
and all that stuff.

00:13:12.850 --> 00:13:15.370
But the first thing, the next night I went
back there actually, I saw the demolition

00:13:15.370 --> 00:13:16.800
derby the first night.

00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:22.660
The second night they had one pen full of
kids and one pen full of sheep.

00:13:22.660 --> 00:13:26.100
And my immediate thought was whatever combination
these two things are gonna combine is probably

00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:30.630
not gonna be a good combination and in fact,
they would take one kid, put a bicycle helmet

00:13:30.630 --> 00:13:35.000
on this kid and put him on top of, or her,
on top of a sheep, put a rope around the sheep,

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:39.709
open the gate and they had this Wyoming fan
favorite called mutton busting.

00:13:39.709 --> 00:13:44.600
And no kids were harmed in the making of this
slide, but basically these poor kids are holding

00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:49.879
on for dear life, between kinda 6 and 10 years
old and I immediately thought this is probably

00:13:49.879 --> 00:13:54.800
not the best use of childhood fitness and
activity incentivization but yet everybody

00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:55.880
was OK in this.

00:13:55.880 --> 00:14:00.750
So my basic job is to help my patients be
active and help them understand when they're

00:14:00.750 --> 00:14:01.750
doing something stupid.

00:14:01.750 --> 00:14:04.249
And that I thought was probably something
a little bit stupid.

00:14:04.249 --> 00:14:05.249
So how do you do that?

00:14:05.249 --> 00:14:09.290
And so when I see somebody, we see a couple
different categories of injury, number one

00:14:09.290 --> 00:14:10.830
is called an acute traumatic injury.

00:14:10.830 --> 00:14:15.750
So I just got a call on Sunday, actually in
Iceland, from one of my patients who's getting

00:14:15.750 --> 00:14:19.180
ready to be in the Olympic trials for gymnastics
who I've taken care of since she was quite

00:14:19.180 --> 00:14:20.180
small.

00:14:20.180 --> 00:14:23.320
And she landed and hurt her wrist so I was
worried about an acute injury like a fracture.

00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:26.630
And so sometimes athletes need to know, be
they an Olympic athlete or somebody just getting

00:14:26.630 --> 00:14:30.779
ready for whatever, you know, is this twist
of my knee that I did something I have to

00:14:30.779 --> 00:14:32.430
worry about and how do I know?

00:14:32.430 --> 00:14:36.320
And then, more commonly, about 90% of injuries
in sport medicine are what we call overuse

00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:37.320
injuries.

00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:40.440
So it's not one thing, but it's I've been
training for the marathon and my shins start

00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:43.720
to hurt or my knee starts to hurt or I'm swimming
a lot and my shoulder hurts.

00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:45.930
And how do you recognize when one of those
injuries is more serious?

00:14:45.930 --> 00:14:51.079
And the answer is when pain changes your mechanic
of movement then I start to worry about those

00:14:51.079 --> 00:14:52.160
kind of injuries.

00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:57.019
So I'm gonna just make some comments on running,
I know here in New York City, this is certainly

00:14:57.019 --> 00:14:58.019
is the most common.

00:14:58.019 --> 00:14:59.019
Who's a runner here?

00:14:59.019 --> 00:15:01.640
Let's see, we've got some, yeah I know and
I see a lot of you runners in my office.

00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:05.279
And I'm sure out in California you have even
more runners.

00:15:05.279 --> 00:15:08.959
And so I'm gonna talk about running in particularly
and some of the common things that we do and

00:15:08.959 --> 00:15:12.399
I'm just gonna make a couple comments on running
and then we'll do some questions.

00:15:12.399 --> 00:15:15.339
So what does it take to basically make you
a healthy runner?

00:15:15.339 --> 00:15:19.160
And I'm gonna talk about gear, goals, injury
recognition and then lastly the important

00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:20.350
part, which is prevention.

00:15:20.350 --> 00:15:23.330
Prevention of running injuries so you can
keep moving.

00:15:23.330 --> 00:15:28.759
So we've seen a lot recently about new trends
and fads in running gear.

00:15:28.759 --> 00:15:31.839
And basically running is a great sport because
it's so inexpensive.

00:15:31.839 --> 00:15:33.890
All you need to do is buy a pair of running
shoes.

00:15:33.890 --> 00:15:37.040
Just curious, who's read the book "Born to
Run"?

00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:40.879
Several in the room and so the concept of
this book is basically that less is more.

00:15:40.879 --> 00:15:45.040
That by minimalizing or giving you a pair
of minimalist shoes or even this shoe on the

00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:49.180
left here called a Newton, which tips you
forward a little bit, you can basically shorten

00:15:49.180 --> 00:15:52.029
your stride and quicken your cadence.

00:15:52.029 --> 00:15:55.069
And the answer is, the answer is that we think
that's probably true that having a higher

00:15:55.069 --> 00:15:58.509
cadence and a shorter stride is much less
injury producing.

00:15:58.509 --> 00:16:03.220
So what you should be doing is, you don’t
need to be buying minimalist shoes to do that,

00:16:03.220 --> 00:16:05.170
just try shortening your stride and quickening
your cadence.

00:16:05.170 --> 00:16:09.220
And certainly some shoes, such as like the
five fingered toes shoes can help make that

00:16:09.220 --> 00:16:12.209
happen in the short term and I can answer
questions about how to know if you want to

00:16:12.209 --> 00:16:13.459
do that or not.

00:16:13.459 --> 00:16:16.940
But the overall concept is that a shortened
stride and a higher cadence is a good thing

00:16:16.940 --> 00:16:21.950
to start thinking about for basically reducing
your risk of running injury.

00:16:21.950 --> 00:16:23.269
What about goal setting?

00:16:23.269 --> 00:16:26.270
Well I think goal setting is very helpful
and some of the problems we see from goal

00:16:26.270 --> 00:16:28.310
setting are, well first of all not setting
goals at all.

00:16:28.310 --> 00:16:32.060
So you definitely want to give yourself a
goal, whatever that is, a 5k race in the park.

00:16:32.060 --> 00:16:35.930
You're lucky to be living in New York, I was
surprised how great the sports scene is in

00:16:35.930 --> 00:16:36.930
New York.

00:16:36.930 --> 00:16:39.079
For those in California, you know, they're
kinda spoiled because they can roll out of

00:16:39.079 --> 00:16:41.240
bed and go do a big bike ride right out of
their door.

00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:44.310
But we have an amazing sport resources here
in New York and probably the best running

00:16:44.310 --> 00:16:47.690
club, the Road Runners club is probably the
best road running club in the world.

00:16:47.690 --> 00:16:52.059
And just amazing races every weekend all over
the place and so it's been a great place to

00:16:52.059 --> 00:16:53.059
do.

00:16:53.059 --> 00:16:56.689
So you want to give yourself a goal and the
concepts of some of these charity programs

00:16:56.689 --> 00:17:00.709
have convinced people you can train for the
marathon in three months and not get hurt.

00:17:00.709 --> 00:17:04.829
And the answer is, that you know, unfortunately
that’s a huge part of my business even though

00:17:04.829 --> 00:17:07.420
I try and teach people how not to come in
to see me.

00:17:07.420 --> 00:17:10.540
But unfortunately these people say alright
I can do the marathon in three or four months

00:17:10.540 --> 00:17:13.589
and the answer is that most people can't,
they get hurt because they don’t have enough

00:17:13.589 --> 00:17:15.439
base training or experience.

00:17:15.439 --> 00:17:19.781
And they’ve not gone through the building
phase of how it takes to build strength, bone

00:17:19.781 --> 00:17:22.600
strength and muscle strength which we'll talk
about next.

00:17:22.600 --> 00:17:26.850
Now what this guy taught us was that basically
not every body is built for everything and

00:17:26.850 --> 00:17:29.950
some bodies are built better for some sports
than others.

00:17:29.950 --> 00:17:34.790
And so if you have a running body, and for
girls, that's probably, or women, that's probably

00:17:34.790 --> 00:17:38.800
about 5'2 and 90 pounds and for men, it's
about 5'6 and 120 pounds.

00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:42.320
And if you don’t have that body, which basically
almost nobody does unless you're an amazing

00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:46.720
Kenyan marathon runner, then you have to change
the way you train and change the way you think

00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:48.470
about what you're gonna do.

00:17:48.470 --> 00:17:53.320
Now, I think nothing I can tell you illustrates
this point as well as this video.

00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:54.320
Which hopefully this will work.

00:17:54.320 --> 00:17:58.280
This comes every year in japan, they have
the running of the Sumos and these guys are

00:17:58.280 --> 00:18:02.640
built, these guys are built exceptionally
well for sumo wrestling but they're not built

00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:03.640
very well for running.

00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:06.290
So were going to see what this looks like,
hopefully.

00:18:06.290 --> 00:18:08.380
Oh come on dude.

00:18:08.380 --> 00:18:12.050
I gotta pull out the Sumo, I'm sorry.

00:18:12.050 --> 00:18:13.770
[pause]

00:18:13.770 --> 00:18:22.840
I won't pull up all but I gotta pull up the
running sumo.

00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:25.170
Where is he?

00:18:25.170 --> 00:18:28.150
Here he is.

00:18:28.150 --> 00:18:35.560
So this is what the running sumo looks like
and the concept of the running sumo which

00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:37.110
is pretty dramatic footage.

00:18:37.110 --> 00:18:41.140
In Japan they do all kinds of interesting
stuff and having their sumo wrestlers run

00:18:41.140 --> 00:18:44.670
down the street and video tape them, it's
one of the interesting things they do.

00:18:44.670 --> 00:18:49.240
So this guy's really not built for running,
I'm sorry to tell you.

00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:50.820
That’s not what you want to look like.

00:18:50.820 --> 00:18:54.140
This guy's built great for sumo wrestling
but he's not built for running.

00:18:54.140 --> 00:18:58.710
And so the concept of this is that not everybody
is built for every activity.

00:18:58.710 --> 00:19:03.470
And basically Darwinian selection will kind
of tell us what you're built for.

00:19:03.470 --> 00:19:08.960
So the further, the concept is, the further
you are from the idealized running body, the

00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:10.620
more problems you're gonna have.

00:19:10.620 --> 00:19:15.080
So the optimal training program, as far as
I'm concerned is a gradual build, some combination

00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:19.740
of mileage and strength training and cardiovascular
training all the while.

00:19:19.740 --> 00:19:22.380
You can't run every single day, nobody can.

00:19:22.380 --> 00:19:24.549
And you wanna have a good time.

00:19:24.549 --> 00:19:28.780
So let's talk now about injury, which is sort
of the thrust of what the book's about.

00:19:28.780 --> 00:19:32.730
About recognizing and preventing injury and
so I want you to think about when an injury

00:19:32.730 --> 00:19:33.730
is serious.

00:19:33.730 --> 00:19:37.450
And the answer is if it's a baseball player,
if it's a runner, if it's a swimmer, a gymnast,

00:19:37.450 --> 00:19:40.811
I ask my patients the same thing of any age
and I take care of people from kinda 8 year

00:19:40.811 --> 00:19:45.250
old elite level gymnast to kind of 85 year
old lady that ran a marathon this year.

00:19:45.250 --> 00:19:47.820
And the commonality of all these is they want
to be active and move.

00:19:47.820 --> 00:19:49.210
And I want them to be active and move.

00:19:49.210 --> 00:19:54.420
So, when an injury is serious, is it changes
your body's ability to do the sport regularly.

00:19:54.420 --> 00:19:57.540
So if you could throw a baseball well but
then your elbow hurts cause you're throwing

00:19:57.540 --> 00:19:59.700
the baseball improperly, I wanna see you.

00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:02.650
If you're running and your shin is hurting
so much that you can't run properly, I wanna

00:20:02.650 --> 00:20:03.650
see you.

00:20:03.650 --> 00:20:06.530
So the mechanic of movement and the change
in the pattern of the mechanic of movement

00:20:06.530 --> 00:20:09.110
is really the key issue that I see when an
injury happens.

00:20:09.110 --> 00:20:13.290
So when it comes to running, I wanna talk
to you about three things; training and your

00:20:13.290 --> 00:20:17.060
anatomy and the biomechanical factors that
go into injury and I'm gonna pull out a couple

00:20:17.060 --> 00:20:18.260
of these videos to show you.

00:20:18.260 --> 00:20:22.490
Now, the overall concept that I'm gonna kind
of impress upon you is call the kinetic chain

00:20:22.490 --> 00:20:23.490
of the body.

00:20:23.490 --> 00:20:27.071
And you so you kinda learn the song "the shin
bone is connected to the knee bone" and the

00:20:27.071 --> 00:20:31.950
answer to that is true, that all the bones
are connected and we can't change your anatomy.

00:20:31.950 --> 00:20:35.180
So if you're built a certain way because your
grandparents and their grandparents and their

00:20:35.180 --> 00:20:38.420
grandparents all the way back, that’s who
you are.

00:20:38.420 --> 00:20:42.170
I can't change how much cartilage you have
in your knee, I can't change if you have a

00:20:42.170 --> 00:20:43.470
bulging disc in your back.

00:20:43.470 --> 00:20:47.900
I can't change if you, you know, I can't change
those fixed anatomical factors.

00:20:47.900 --> 00:20:52.370
What I very much can change in you and this
talk is a lot about empowering you to change

00:20:52.370 --> 00:20:57.710
this, is you can change your kinetic chain,
and that is the muscular forces around those

00:20:57.710 --> 00:21:01.110
bone and ligaments and tendons and muscles.

00:21:01.110 --> 00:21:06.110
The muscles are the dynamic stabilizers, the
stronger your muscles, the strong your kinetic

00:21:06.110 --> 00:21:07.110
chain.

00:21:07.110 --> 00:21:11.050
So if you have plantar fasciitis or iliotibial
band syndrome, part of what we do with you

00:21:11.050 --> 00:21:14.750
is get you started on a good functional strength
training program to strengthen that entire

00:21:14.750 --> 00:21:19.380
chain and as that chain gets stronger, your
pain will go away and stay away.

00:21:19.380 --> 00:21:23.530
So the answer is if your back hurts from a
bulging disc, don’t sit on your butt.

00:21:23.530 --> 00:21:25.960
The answer is, start to work on strengthening.

00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:30.150
And that's a lot about what this book is about
and what I'm gonna talk to you guys about.

00:21:30.150 --> 00:21:34.260
So injuries happen, I'm just gonna push ahead,
I don’t care if I'm in pain, I'm not listening

00:21:34.260 --> 00:21:36.080
to my body and all the sudden injuries happen.

00:21:36.080 --> 00:21:39.560
And that’s often how injuries happen and
they can be overuse injuries in the tendon

00:21:39.560 --> 00:21:43.220
such as this Achilles which as a big thickening
in the tendon like a partial tear.

00:21:43.220 --> 00:21:46.200
MRI has been very very helpful to help us
diagnose these kind of injuries.

00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:48.570
This is a big crack in the hip; this is somebody
with a stress fracture.

00:21:48.570 --> 00:21:50.200
Just saw one of those this morning.

00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:52.750
Somebody training for the Iron Man who got
a stress fracture in their hip.

00:21:52.750 --> 00:21:56.970
Again, this is not an acute injury so you
won't know you have this.

00:21:56.970 --> 00:21:59.670
You'll know that the more you do the more
pain you're having.

00:21:59.670 --> 00:22:02.510
And the pain is changing how you move because
it hurts so much.

00:22:02.510 --> 00:22:04.030
And that's when you gotta get it checked out.

00:22:04.030 --> 00:22:07.600
So let's now talk about prevention which is
kind of the thrust of what this is gonna be

00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:08.600
about.

00:22:08.600 --> 00:22:09.890
So what are the ways you can prevent injury?

00:22:09.890 --> 00:22:12.300
And first of all you wanna gradually build
your training.

00:22:12.300 --> 00:22:13.920
We're gonna talk about running form.

00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:18.270
And then lastly were gonna talk about preventive
strengthening and the role of preventive strengthening.

00:22:18.270 --> 00:22:22.100
So there's, this graph kinda shows how much
stress you're putting on your body and the

00:22:22.100 --> 00:22:24.000
frequency of how much you run.

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:26.290
And the concept here is there's what's called
the injury threshold.

00:22:26.290 --> 00:22:27.950
No injury and injury.

00:22:27.950 --> 00:22:32.270
And how do we take this line and push this
out so you can basically have more frequency

00:22:32.270 --> 00:22:33.270
of running-

00:22:33.270 --> 00:22:34.270
[Whip sound]

00:22:34.270 --> 00:22:35.270
&gt;&gt;Jordan Metzl: We want that.

00:22:35.270 --> 00:22:36.270
Alight, we want that line out there.

00:22:36.270 --> 00:22:37.270
How do we keep ourselves here –

00:22:37.270 --> 00:22:38.270
[Whip sound]

00:22:38.270 --> 00:22:39.270
&gt;&gt;Jordan Metzl: -so that we push that threshold
out.

00:22:39.270 --> 00:22:42.540
And the answer is, we're gonna change how
we run and we're gonna change how much strength

00:22:42.540 --> 00:22:43.540
we have.

00:22:43.540 --> 00:22:45.730
Those are the variables we can change.

00:22:45.730 --> 00:22:49.900
So when you think about running, basically
you're never on two feet at a time except

00:22:49.900 --> 00:22:51.330
for at the start and the end of the race.

00:22:51.330 --> 00:22:55.160
And other than that, running is a series of
plyometric jumps from one leg to the other

00:22:55.160 --> 00:22:58.700
and there is no exact right way to run.

00:22:58.700 --> 00:23:02.260
But basically what I can tell you is that
I take care of a number of both triathletes

00:23:02.260 --> 00:23:06.560
and runners and in my office, the triathletes
are hurt much less frequently, even though

00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:08.350
they train about four times as much.

00:23:08.350 --> 00:23:13.480
And the answer is because they do much more
functional training as part of what they do.

00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:16.000
So in this, I'm not gonna pull these out and
play them, but basically I have somebody's

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:19.190
here who is stepping down off a box, let's
make sure these are not gonna work –

00:23:19.190 --> 00:23:21.510
&gt;&gt;male voice: OK whenever you're ready step
down-

00:23:21.510 --> 00:23:22.510
Alright, not gonna work.

00:23:22.510 --> 00:23:26.270
So, she steps down off this small box, one
side versus the other, and the one leg that’s

00:23:26.270 --> 00:23:30.850
not hurt, she steps down very evenly, and
the other side her knee is all wobbly when

00:23:30.850 --> 00:23:36.100
she steps down and the answer is that as she
starts to wobble in that knee, the stability

00:23:36.100 --> 00:23:37.550
of her hips and her knee joint is affected.

00:23:37.550 --> 00:23:40.050
So she's not strong enough on this side she's
hurt with.

00:23:40.050 --> 00:23:44.350
So if you're getting knee pain from running,
the answer is you have to strengthen the muscles

00:23:44.350 --> 00:23:47.600
in the kinetic chain on that side of the body
particularly because what ends up happening

00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:52.921
over time, is that this cartilage starts to
rub on this femur bone and you start to get

00:23:52.921 --> 00:23:55.830
a lot of achiness underneath your knee called
runners knee which is pretty much the most

00:23:55.830 --> 00:23:58.630
common knee problem that I see.

00:23:58.630 --> 00:24:00.620
So how do we talk to people about improving
their running form?

00:24:00.620 --> 00:24:04.010
And we talk about things such as running drills,
running uphill I love.

00:24:04.010 --> 00:24:07.950
The concept of running uphill is you shorten
your stride and quicken your cadence and so

00:24:07.950 --> 00:24:11.041
you should be somewhere between 85 and 90
beats per minute.

00:24:11.041 --> 00:24:13.880
Meaning the left or right foot should hit
the ground 85 to 90 times per minute.

00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:15.440
Most people don’t do that.

00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:16.610
Most people over stride.

00:24:16.610 --> 00:24:20.190
So by shortening the stride and quickening
the cadence the landing force is much else.

00:24:20.190 --> 00:24:24.970
That’s why the barefoot shoes make a difference
in even some of the shorter training is that

00:24:24.970 --> 00:24:28.460
you keep your weight over your forefoot to
your midfoot instead of heel striking.

00:24:28.460 --> 00:24:30.560
Which gives you a much shorter stride and
a quicker turnover.

00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:32.700
So try running uphill and see how different
it is.

00:24:32.700 --> 00:24:36.040
In fact I teach an outdoor strength training
class, I teach a strength training class every

00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:38.890
two weeks in Central Park, I don’t know
what time you guys get up but we do it at

00:24:38.890 --> 00:24:40.240
6:15 in the morning.

00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:42.720
And if anybody wants to come, please come
up here afterwards and give me your email

00:24:42.720 --> 00:24:44.780
and we'll send you our invitation to come
try this thing.

00:24:44.780 --> 00:24:47.800
We have about a hundred people at a time and
we do this in Central Park and it’s a lot

00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:48.800
of fun.

00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:51.660
We do some combination of running drill and
preventive strengthening called plyometric

00:24:51.660 --> 00:24:52.860
which we're getting to next.

00:24:52.860 --> 00:24:57.030
So running drill, number one, preventive strengthening,
number 2.

00:24:57.030 --> 00:24:58.190
Stretching is way over rated.

00:24:58.190 --> 00:25:02.860
Alright, so all of you who are spending your
whole life stretching for running way overrated.

00:25:02.860 --> 00:25:04.640
Strengthening is way more important.

00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:08.820
So we see a lot of people that stride out
way, way too far in their running stride and

00:25:08.820 --> 00:25:12.610
what ends up happening is they land with all
their weight on their heel and they have these

00:25:12.610 --> 00:25:13.690
different kinds of problems.

00:25:13.690 --> 00:25:18.370
So this, and I may pull this out to show you,
but basically what we're doing now is much

00:25:18.370 --> 00:25:22.240
of this functional motion screen and we're
using a lot of the great stuff you guys are

00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:26.070
helping us develop which is, in medicine now,
taking the technology of what it looks like

00:25:26.070 --> 00:25:27.070
to move.

00:25:27.070 --> 00:25:29.220
And I'm gonna show you, I know you guys will
be into this so I'm going to pull this out

00:25:29.220 --> 00:25:30.220
really quickly.

00:25:30.220 --> 00:25:31.660
Just to show you.

00:25:31.660 --> 00:25:34.820
I gotta get him outta the way.

00:25:34.820 --> 00:25:36.870
I gotta close him, he's too distracting.

00:25:36.870 --> 00:25:41.880
But just to show you what this looks like.

00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:44.040
So we're doing a lot of more of this functional
movement.

00:25:44.040 --> 00:25:47.910
And we can basically put markers on people
and check where they're landing, how they're

00:25:47.910 --> 00:25:52.180
landing, where their maximum impact is and
many of our athletes that come in with these

00:25:52.180 --> 00:25:56.920
problems are essentially over striding, so
you know you can pay some, I dunno, 150 or

00:25:56.920 --> 00:26:00.410
200 dollars to come to our hospital and get
this done.

00:26:00.410 --> 00:26:04.050
Or I can just tell you now, shorten your stride
and quicken your cadence and do some strength

00:26:04.050 --> 00:26:05.050
training and you won't get hurt.

00:26:05.050 --> 00:26:06.050
And that’s free.

00:26:06.050 --> 00:26:07.780
So try that first before you come up here
and do that.

00:26:07.780 --> 00:26:12.730
But that’s the concept of using technology
which I think is pretty cool to really make,

00:26:12.730 --> 00:26:15.410
you know, movement patterns a lot healthier
and safer for people.

00:26:15.410 --> 00:26:18.410
Which is I think really neat, and obviously
you guys are so helpful with that for us.

00:26:18.410 --> 00:26:21.830
So as I mentioned, stretching, way over rated.

00:26:21.830 --> 00:26:23.510
Strengthening, way underrated.

00:26:23.510 --> 00:26:26.830
So then let's lastly talk about this functional
strength training and prevention to make you

00:26:26.830 --> 00:26:30.650
run better and much less injuries as well.

00:26:30.650 --> 00:26:34.010
So what I'm big into is this functional training
called plyometric training.

00:26:34.010 --> 00:26:38.440
And plyometric training is basically using
your body weight and rapid muscle contraction

00:26:38.440 --> 00:26:41.110
and elongation to essentially build functional
strength.

00:26:41.110 --> 00:26:43.890
It makes people faster, it makes them hurt
less.

00:26:43.890 --> 00:26:48.080
It reduces the reaction force between your,
basically, joints and the ground so much less

00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:51.080
compression force, it protects your joints
and your body.

00:26:51.080 --> 00:26:52.790
And most importantly you don’t need a fancy
gym.

00:26:52.790 --> 00:26:54.340
You can do this anywhere.

00:26:54.340 --> 00:27:00.660
Now, when the book came out, I did this functional
strength workout called IronStrength.

00:27:00.660 --> 00:27:04.021
And so the way this thing is set up, is it
kind of talks about every injury and then

00:27:04.021 --> 00:27:07.990
I have a whole section in the back called
IronStrength which is this functional strength

00:27:07.990 --> 00:27:09.760
training workout and video.

00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:13.210
And the video, since this is a Rodale book,
has a link up on Runner's World which free.

00:27:13.210 --> 00:27:17.750
If you just type in Runner's World and put
in my name, or IronStrength and my name, it

00:27:17.750 --> 00:27:20.380
will pull up and you'll see this IronStrength
workout online.

00:27:20.380 --> 00:27:23.280
And that correlates to IronStrength workout
in the book.

00:27:23.280 --> 00:27:26.131
And basically what that’s gonna do is teach
you how to do this functional strength training

00:27:26.131 --> 00:27:27.131
on your own.

00:27:27.131 --> 00:27:30.360
You just follow us along the first month,
January this was up, we had, for us it was

00:27:30.360 --> 00:27:33.940
impressive, I know for you guys that's like
'dude, that's nothing', but we had like 1.7

00:27:33.940 --> 00:27:35.240
million unique views which, is that?

00:27:35.240 --> 00:27:36.240
That's pretty good isn't it?

00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:37.240
So I get a little nod for that?

00:27:37.240 --> 00:27:38.240
Alright, thanks.

00:27:38.240 --> 00:27:41.790
I don’t know if that’s a lot, it seemed
like a lot to me.

00:27:41.790 --> 00:27:47.010
So I was impressed with that, Runner's World,
I mean runners are dedicated readers, voracious

00:27:47.010 --> 00:27:48.010
readers.

00:27:48.010 --> 00:27:49.730
So we had a lot of people looking at that
stuff.

00:27:49.730 --> 00:27:54.660
And this IronStrength workout is a really
helpful tool and I like it because it takes

00:27:54.660 --> 00:27:58.100
this and makes it so that people can kind
of use on their own.

00:27:58.100 --> 00:27:59.100
Which I think is pretty cool.

00:27:59.100 --> 00:28:03.300
So I want you to try this thing and then come
try it live with us in Central Park.

00:28:03.300 --> 00:28:07.080
So, lastly I'll just kinda make a couple comments
on this and answer some questions.

00:28:07.080 --> 00:28:10.910
So the concept of this is it's kind of a full
body resource.

00:28:10.910 --> 00:28:16.160
We did both an eBook and an iBook and the
Apple, on the iPad we have the embedded videos.

00:28:16.160 --> 00:28:19.240
But the paperback is actually really neat
and I appreciate you guys having some people

00:28:19.240 --> 00:28:22.490
here and I understand there's some kind of
thing that ran out but there's a way to get

00:28:22.490 --> 00:28:25.050
more and Rich'll tell you more about that
at the end.

00:28:25.050 --> 00:28:29.500
I did bring one signed free copy for somebody
and the question is who's gonna get the free

00:28:29.500 --> 00:28:30.720
copy, the signed copy?

00:28:30.720 --> 00:28:36.310
And the answer is who here has run more than
20 marathons?

00:28:36.310 --> 00:28:37.310
Anybody?

00:28:37.310 --> 00:28:38.310
[Pause]

00:28:38.310 --> 00:28:39.310
[Audience giggle]

00:28:39.310 --> 00:28:40.310
&gt;&gt;Male #1: Michael

00:28:40.310 --> 00:28:41.740
&gt;&gt;Jordan Metzl: Michael?

00:28:41.740 --> 00:28:44.840
Alright anybody run more than 16 marathons?

00:28:44.840 --> 00:28:48.190
Michael, get up here, dude, you just won yourself
a free autographed book.

00:28:48.190 --> 00:28:49.480
[Applause and hoots]

00:28:49.480 --> 00:28:50.770
&gt;&gt;Jordan Metzl: Congratulations.

00:28:50.770 --> 00:28:52.060
[Inaudible from audience]

00:28:52.060 --> 00:28:57.750
&gt;&gt;Jordan Metzl: Good, if I hit it big time,
it's signed, it'll be worth something someday.

00:28:57.750 --> 00:29:00.550
Now for those of you, and I'm giving this
to Rich this actually just came out today,

00:29:00.550 --> 00:29:03.360
this is not related to this book topic but
it's similar concept.

00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:07.140
In is it, I did this thing with the American
Academy of Pediatrics and it's called "Home

00:29:07.140 --> 00:29:08.570
Based Strength Training for Young Athletes."

00:29:08.570 --> 00:29:11.640
It's basically encouraging parents to start
strength training with their kids.

00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:14.780
Starting at age eight and it's a high repetition
light weight training.

00:29:14.780 --> 00:29:18.100
In kids sports we're seeing problems of a
lot of youth sports specialization and increase

00:29:18.100 --> 00:29:19.480
in injury risk.

00:29:19.480 --> 00:29:23.910
And so we want parents, the best trainers
are not professionals, it's parents and so

00:29:23.910 --> 00:29:25.620
I want parents to do this with their kids.

00:29:25.620 --> 00:29:28.360
Rich, who invited me, gets to take this home
and start.

00:29:28.360 --> 00:29:29.360
How old's your daughter?

00:29:29.360 --> 00:29:30.890
&gt;&gt;Rich: I've got three.

00:29:30.890 --> 00:29:32.460
&gt;&gt;Jordan Metzl: Anybody old enough?

00:29:32.460 --> 00:29:33.460
Good.

00:29:33.460 --> 00:29:34.460
&gt;&gt;Rich: The oldest is nine.

00:29:34.460 --> 00:29:35.460
&gt;&gt;Jordan Metzl: Perfect.

00:29:35.460 --> 00:29:39.060
Alright, so the concept of kids doing strength
training is something which is, people think

00:29:39.060 --> 00:29:40.210
is that, the answer is it's great.

00:29:40.210 --> 00:29:43.830
It starts to build bone density, functional
strength and is a great thing to do.

00:29:43.830 --> 00:29:45.440
So, enjoy that.

00:29:45.440 --> 00:29:49.570
So the concept of this book is to teach you
guys how to recognize every injury you'll

00:29:49.570 --> 00:29:51.140
get, number one.

00:29:51.140 --> 00:29:54.040
Number two, how you can take care of it at
home on your own.

00:29:54.040 --> 00:29:55.560
And number three, do you need to see a doctor?

00:29:55.560 --> 00:29:57.500
And then number four, do you need surgery?

00:29:57.500 --> 00:30:03.510
And as you know, kind of the nexus of medicine
and technology has been uniformly great.

00:30:03.510 --> 00:30:07.520
But for example 50% of the population has
a torn meniscus, 60% of the population has

00:30:07.520 --> 00:30:09.880
a bulging or herniated disc.

00:30:09.880 --> 00:30:15.380
Knowing when that herniated disc or torn meniscus
is problematic and when it's not is very difficult

00:30:15.380 --> 00:30:18.250
for somebody who's not in medicine to know.

00:30:18.250 --> 00:30:22.240
And so, what I really want to do is educate
my athletic patients and athletic minded people

00:30:22.240 --> 00:30:25.030
of how you can make the make best decisions
for yourselves.

00:30:25.030 --> 00:30:27.850
Because Dr. Google, I'm sorry, gives a lot
of information.

00:30:27.850 --> 00:30:29.560
Some of it's great, some of it's not so great.

00:30:29.560 --> 00:30:30.620
But a lot of it's out there.

00:30:30.620 --> 00:30:35.670
And so you guys do such a great job supplying
information, but it's a lot of information.

00:30:35.670 --> 00:30:40.370
And helping people kind of disseminate what
is helpful I think is very important for people.

00:30:40.370 --> 00:30:44.430
So with that, I would say please register
for my site so you can stay in touch if you

00:30:44.430 --> 00:30:45.580
want.

00:30:45.580 --> 00:30:49.570
And I'd love to answer any questions about
these topics or your own running related issues

00:30:49.570 --> 00:30:54.440
or just sports in general or anything about
the quality of life, health, and happiness.

00:30:54.440 --> 00:30:56.220
Who's got some questions for me?

00:30:56.220 --> 00:30:57.681
Don’t be shy about your own injuries.

00:30:57.681 --> 00:30:58.681
Yeah?

00:30:58.681 --> 00:31:01.480
&gt;&gt;Male #2: [inaudible] shoulder injury for
strength training-

00:31:01.480 --> 00:31:11.135
&gt;&gt;Jordan Metzl: Oh I'm sorry; you gotta go
to the mic so we can hear.

00:31:11.135 --> 00:31:12.135
[Unintelligible]

00:31:12.135 --> 00:31:13.770
&gt;&gt;Male #2: For like a shoulder injury, doing
strength training.

00:31:13.770 --> 00:31:16.390
What is the, what's the general guideline?

00:31:16.390 --> 00:31:20.350
Is it, this doesn't seem like to be like,
this never really fully goes away.

00:31:20.350 --> 00:31:22.180
So when do you start pushing again?

00:31:22.180 --> 00:31:25.690
&gt;&gt;Jordan Metzl: So some general concepts and
what I'm after in this kind of book and video

00:31:25.690 --> 00:31:27.950
is a lot about what is called functional training.

00:31:27.950 --> 00:31:28.950
What does that mean?

00:31:28.950 --> 00:31:33.150
What it means is, if I just do bicep curls,
I'm just strengthening my bicep, right?

00:31:33.150 --> 00:31:36.850
Or leg extensions on a leg extension machine,
I'm just strengthening my quad.

00:31:36.850 --> 00:31:40.240
And you know, for a long time people did that
kind of training and many do at a number of

00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:41.661
gyms around the area.

00:31:41.661 --> 00:31:45.930
But the problem is it's not very helpful nor
very efficient and it seems to kind of not

00:31:45.930 --> 00:31:47.580
do much in terms of what's called functional.

00:31:47.580 --> 00:31:51.500
And so functional training is doing, like
in our video we have multiple body motions

00:31:51.500 --> 00:31:54.920
at the same time with high repetition, light
weight training.

00:31:54.920 --> 00:31:58.840
And so it's not like you're doing big weights
but it's higher repetitions of a light weight

00:31:58.840 --> 00:32:01.740
which, over time, builds almost equivalent
strength.

00:32:01.740 --> 00:32:05.881
And so the answer to a shoulder injury, you
know, depending on what is, is that kind of

00:32:05.881 --> 00:32:07.380
get rid of the irritant in the shoulder.

00:32:07.380 --> 00:32:11.310
So sometimes we do injections of a little
steroid into a bursa or whatever the problem

00:32:11.310 --> 00:32:12.310
is.

00:32:12.310 --> 00:32:14.300
And then do this functional training around
the joint.

00:32:14.300 --> 00:32:17.811
And it's high repetition and light weight
training which almost counter intuitive to

00:32:17.811 --> 00:32:19.190
the way people think about training.

00:32:19.190 --> 00:32:22.750
And it really seems to change that kinda way
that people do it.

00:32:22.750 --> 00:32:26.480
So you can effectively train, and in the shoulder,
particularly, is very amenable, the strength

00:32:26.480 --> 00:32:27.480
around it.

00:32:27.480 --> 00:32:28.520
And just knowing what to do should help a
lot.

00:32:28.520 --> 00:32:29.790
So give it a try and let me know.

00:32:29.790 --> 00:32:35.930
&gt;&gt;Male #3: Yeah, I'm curious about recuperation
from particularly like long distance running

00:32:35.930 --> 00:32:38.450
or specific workout.

00:32:38.450 --> 00:32:42.240
So, in particular ice, the use of ice and
ibuprofen.

00:32:42.240 --> 00:32:43.690
&gt;&gt;Jordan Metzl: Sure.

00:32:43.690 --> 00:32:47.760
So basically inflammation is both a good thing
and a bad thing.

00:32:47.760 --> 00:32:52.020
So inflammation is helpful when something
gets irritated or inflamed, its very helpful

00:32:52.020 --> 00:32:53.020
for us.

00:32:53.020 --> 00:32:56.670
Cause it kinda, it's a body marker, hey, we
got a problem here.

00:32:56.670 --> 00:32:59.160
When somebody does something, so there's helpful
and hurtful inflammation.

00:32:59.160 --> 00:33:03.350
So an Achilles tendon, you go out for a long
run, you get some Achilles tendinitis.

00:33:03.350 --> 00:33:07.180
Over time if that goes on and on it can actually
start to, like a cavity, start to wear down

00:33:07.180 --> 00:33:10.040
that tendon and you get tendinosis and then
a chronic partial tear.

00:33:10.040 --> 00:33:14.310
So you get a whole kind of host of problems
that happens over time if something's just

00:33:14.310 --> 00:33:15.780
chronically irritated.

00:33:15.780 --> 00:33:19.630
So there's chronic inflammation and there's
kinda something after doing a particular event.

00:33:19.630 --> 00:33:23.030
And the answer is that you know, we love the
George Costanza special.

00:33:23.030 --> 00:33:26.760
Which is getting in an ice bath, which is
a very helpful way to get in something cold

00:33:26.760 --> 00:33:29.720
for you know, if you can make it 5 minutes
in an ice bath.

00:33:29.720 --> 00:33:32.550
And much like boiling a frog, though I've
never done it, but what they say if you're

00:33:32.550 --> 00:33:36.540
going to boil a frog, which hopefully nobody
here or in California has ever done, is if

00:33:36.540 --> 00:33:39.780
you just put the frog in water it jumps right
out but if you put the frog in and gradually

00:33:39.780 --> 00:33:41.190
turn up the heat, it stays in there.

00:33:41.190 --> 00:33:43.710
I don’t know if that's true or not but that's
the story.

00:33:43.710 --> 00:33:45.840
And so with cold water and ice baths it's
the same thing.

00:33:45.840 --> 00:33:50.280
Get in there and start dumping some ice in
and over time as the temperature lowers, supposedly,

00:33:50.280 --> 00:33:53.260
and I do know this, it's actually much more
able to tolerate that.

00:33:53.260 --> 00:33:58.740
So I think for post-run recovery, nothing,
anything over and hour and half, nothing beats

00:33:58.740 --> 00:33:59.740
an ice bath.

00:33:59.740 --> 00:34:04.810
So getting into a cold bath will definitely
help expedite your recovery as well as getting

00:34:04.810 --> 00:34:08.579
a carb and fat something in your body within
a half hour.

00:34:08.579 --> 00:34:11.050
That's called the Golden Half Hour after a
big work out.

00:34:11.050 --> 00:34:14.349
So don't wait two hours, take a nap and then
go eat.

00:34:14.349 --> 00:34:17.810
You basically start to, your turnaround will
get quicker if you refuel that muscle glycogen

00:34:17.810 --> 00:34:19.580
within a half hour of your exercise.

00:34:19.580 --> 00:34:23.210
So those are the things: ice and getting that
fuel in right away are the two really helpful

00:34:23.210 --> 00:34:24.210
things.

00:34:24.210 --> 00:34:25.290
&gt;&gt;Male #3: Are you against ibuprofen in general?

00:34:25.290 --> 00:34:29.429
&gt;&gt;Jordan Metzl: I'm not at all, I think basically
for longer stuff I guess there's what I do

00:34:29.429 --> 00:34:31.030
and what I say.

00:34:31.030 --> 00:34:34.540
What I say is, you know, probably not a great
idea for big doses for sure.

00:34:34.540 --> 00:34:39.400
If you wanna pop one here or there before
you do stuff I think that's probably OK The

00:34:39.400 --> 00:34:43.550
problem with ibuprofen and you know, much,
you know many of these are sold over the counter,

00:34:43.550 --> 00:34:46.379
is they think alright, well it's like Advil,
it's candy coated, I can just take that, but

00:34:46.379 --> 00:34:47.379
these are drugs.

00:34:47.379 --> 00:34:48.460
And if you take enough of those, you can cause
a real problem.

00:34:48.460 --> 00:34:51.629
So a little bit here and there I don’t think
is usually problematic, you know a lot can

00:34:51.629 --> 00:34:52.629
be a big issue.

00:34:52.629 --> 00:34:54.020
But they can certainly cause ulcers, too.

00:34:54.020 --> 00:34:59.920
So you have to be careful not to do any lots
of that stuff on an empty stomach.

00:34:59.920 --> 00:35:00.920
&gt;&gt;Male #3: Thanks.

00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:01.920
&gt;&gt;Jordan Metzl: Sure.

00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:03.640
&gt;&gt;Male #4: So, you and everybody else says
walking is a great regular way to stay in

00:35:03.640 --> 00:35:07.000
shape without having to put a phenomenal amount
of effort in.

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:11.250
I don't like walking, I like bicycling, is
that just as good?

00:35:11.250 --> 00:35:15.390
&gt;&gt;Jordan Metzl: So, that's a great question
and the answer is that I generally find people

00:35:15.390 --> 00:35:19.360
are the most compliant with their exercise
prescription if they like what they're doing.

00:35:19.360 --> 00:35:22.390
And so if they feel like I have to run cause
this guy told me I have to walk around but

00:35:22.390 --> 00:35:26.750
I hate it, I love biking then they're gonna
not do it and nothing, anything is better

00:35:26.750 --> 00:35:27.750
than nothing.

00:35:27.750 --> 00:35:33.300
In the relative scale of expenditure, you
know hard running is the most time effective

00:35:33.300 --> 00:35:34.330
per whatever you can do.

00:35:34.330 --> 00:35:35.330
A hard run.

00:35:35.330 --> 00:35:38.470
But if you're like hating every step and you're
not pushing yourself, it's terrible for you.

00:35:38.470 --> 00:35:40.671
So if you can get your, it's all about getting
your heart rate up.

00:35:40.671 --> 00:35:45.260
And if you can push your cardiovascular threshold
and really get your heart rate up and move,

00:35:45.260 --> 00:35:48.090
by biking, then that's terrific and there
are a number of places to do that.

00:35:48.090 --> 00:35:50.420
So if you like and you'll do it, that’s
a great way.

00:35:50.420 --> 00:35:54.660
And I do think the merits of group exercise,
like spinning particularly, are very helpful

00:35:54.660 --> 00:35:57.130
and people will push themselves a lot harder
if there's a group around.

00:35:57.130 --> 00:36:00.330
So you know, getting, that's why our strength
training class is so much fun, is cause everybody

00:36:00.330 --> 00:36:01.750
basically kicks each other's butt.

00:36:01.750 --> 00:36:03.900
Which is helpful, really makes it work a lot
better.

00:36:03.900 --> 00:36:07.830
So if you can find that dynamic in a spin
class or even a bike thing, you'll get much

00:36:07.830 --> 00:36:10.130
more cardiovascular out of that.

00:36:10.130 --> 00:36:12.290
&gt;&gt; Male #5: Hi, thanks for coming out today.

00:36:12.290 --> 00:36:13.290
&gt;&gt;Jordan Metzl: Sure.

00:36:13.290 --> 00:36:15.280
&gt;&gt; Male #5: Well you know, IT band.

00:36:15.280 --> 00:36:22.191
Just, it is what it is but, to make that a
general thing, are there any pains that you

00:36:22.191 --> 00:36:25.320
would say are OK to push through?

00:36:25.320 --> 00:36:29.020
Or any time you have a pain should you just
stop when it occurs.

00:36:29.020 --> 00:36:31.340
&gt;&gt;Jordan Metzl: Two good questions and I'll
answer the second part first.

00:36:31.340 --> 00:36:36.380
And so the pain issue is when your IT band
pain is changing your running mechanic, then

00:36:36.380 --> 00:36:37.380
it's time to stop.

00:36:37.380 --> 00:36:39.400
If it's a little bit achy here and there,
I don’t worry about it.

00:36:39.400 --> 00:36:44.730
So my telltale thing is if pain changes your
mechanic of movement is number one.

00:36:44.730 --> 00:36:48.870
Now IT band is basically a muscle called the
tensor fasciae latae muscle that runs on the

00:36:48.870 --> 00:36:51.830
outside part of your hip across your hip joint
and your knee joint.

00:36:51.830 --> 00:36:56.290
And the typical person with IT band syndrome
is somebody that comes in saying "I'm running

00:36:56.290 --> 00:37:00.150
about, you know, two, three miles or a mile
and about 10-15 minutes in I feel like somebody's

00:37:00.150 --> 00:37:04.520
jabbing something into the side of my leg"
and that's typically classic IT band syndrome.

00:37:04.520 --> 00:37:07.560
And the answer is number one, flexibility.

00:37:07.560 --> 00:37:11.650
So I have a whole thing in this IronStrength
workout section called the Foam Roller Workout

00:37:11.650 --> 00:37:14.130
and anybody friends with a foam roller?

00:37:14.130 --> 00:37:15.130
Several of you, good.

00:37:15.130 --> 00:37:18.770
And so the foam roller is a great at home
deep tissue massages that you can do pretty

00:37:18.770 --> 00:37:22.730
much every day to loosen up the muscle, the
IT band along the outside part of the leg.

00:37:22.730 --> 00:37:25.150
The second part, then, is building this functional
strength.

00:37:25.150 --> 00:37:29.050
And in the book in our IT band section we
have what's call the Big Butt Bonus.

00:37:29.050 --> 00:37:30.940
And it doesn't mean your butt's gonna get
big, so don't worry.

00:37:30.940 --> 00:37:32.820
But it means your butt's gonna get strong.

00:37:32.820 --> 00:37:36.170
And in the Big Butt Bonus section we have
all these glute strengthening exercises to

00:37:36.170 --> 00:37:37.810
basically keep your pelvis stable.

00:37:37.810 --> 00:37:41.320
The video I didn't show you of this woman
stepping down off the box, you know she was

00:37:41.320 --> 00:37:45.040
somebody who had a lot of IT band problems
and as she was kinda running, her hip was

00:37:45.040 --> 00:37:48.560
dropping on the hurt side and her pelvis was
unstable when she was running.

00:37:48.560 --> 00:37:51.030
And that caused some chronic IT band problems
over time.

00:37:51.030 --> 00:37:52.790
So strengthening is hugely important.

00:37:52.790 --> 00:37:56.420
And the final thing is, there's a little fluid
filled sac called a bursa, which can form

00:37:56.420 --> 00:37:59.370
between the tendon and the bone and sometimes
we have to give a little shot of cortisone

00:37:59.370 --> 00:38:01.050
in that IT band, just in that bursa.

00:38:01.050 --> 00:38:04.660
But again, if you don’t fix the mechanical
factors, it'll just keep happening.

00:38:04.660 --> 00:38:09.080
So, IT band is very fixable, it's very frustrating
for a lot of runners but very fixable with

00:38:09.080 --> 00:38:10.080
the right stuff.

00:38:10.080 --> 00:38:11.080
&gt;&gt; Male #5: Thanks.

00:38:11.080 --> 00:38:12.080
&gt;&gt;Jordan Metzl: Sure.

00:38:12.080 --> 00:38:17.100
&gt;&gt;Female #1: Hi, what about an injury or a
pain that is there only when you rest, not

00:38:17.100 --> 00:38:18.530
when you actually exercise?

00:38:18.530 --> 00:38:19.530
&gt;&gt;Jordan Metzl: That's easy, keep moving.

00:38:19.530 --> 00:38:20.530
That's the –

00:38:20.530 --> 00:38:21.530
[Audience laughter]

00:38:21.530 --> 00:38:22.530
&gt;&gt;Jordan Metzl: [laughs] Umm

00:38:22.530 --> 00:38:23.990
&gt;&gt;Female #1: Yeah but like an acute pain,
you know the sciatic?

00:38:23.990 --> 00:38:28.010
&gt;&gt;Jordan Metzl: So it's not uncommon actually,
people go out, they work out and they get

00:38:28.010 --> 00:38:29.010
some pains afterwards.

00:38:29.010 --> 00:38:32.170
And so, it sounds like sciatic type pain,
here's my guess.

00:38:32.170 --> 00:38:33.330
When you're sitting on it, it hurts the most?

00:38:33.330 --> 00:38:34.330
&gt;&gt;Female #1: Yeah.

00:38:34.330 --> 00:38:35.600
&gt;&gt;Jordan Metzl: OK, gotcha.

00:38:35.600 --> 00:38:36.600
So pain in the butt, yeah?

00:38:36.600 --> 00:38:37.600
&gt;&gt;Female #1: Yeah.

00:38:37.600 --> 00:38:38.600
[Giggle]

00:38:38.600 --> 00:38:41.740
&gt;&gt;Jordan Metzl: OK, so what's happening is
that the sciatic nerve, in the hip/glut section

00:38:41.740 --> 00:38:44.190
we have two kinds of sciatic pain.

00:38:44.190 --> 00:38:47.000
Sciatic pain can come out of the back and
what happens is you get a bulging disc in

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:50.040
your back which pushes in nerve and shoots
pain down your leg.

00:38:50.040 --> 00:38:51.400
And those hurt all the time.

00:38:51.400 --> 00:38:55.840
Or you can get the sciatic nerve running through
the butt muscle and the butt muscle, called

00:38:55.840 --> 00:38:58.990
the piriformis muscle, will squeeze that nerve
after you've worked out.

00:38:58.990 --> 00:39:01.580
And basically just shoot this pain down the
back of your leg, especially when you're sitting

00:39:01.580 --> 00:39:02.580
on it.

00:39:02.580 --> 00:39:05.900
And again, a little bit of anti-inflammatory
medicine can make that feel better but the

00:39:05.900 --> 00:39:08.580
key is building, sorry, but building a stronger
butt.

00:39:08.580 --> 00:39:12.140
And the stronger your butt muscle gets, the
less that muscle will want to squeeze on that

00:39:12.140 --> 00:39:13.140
nerve.

00:39:13.140 --> 00:39:15.230
And so, you need a stronger butt, and that's
the answer.

00:39:15.230 --> 00:39:17.860
And then the last thing is I have a whole
bunch of stuff in there on some different

00:39:17.860 --> 00:39:20.430
stretching, the Figure Four stretch is helpful.

00:39:20.430 --> 00:39:23.100
That's where one case where flexibility can
make a difference to loosen it up.

00:39:23.100 --> 00:39:27.880
But to really fix it you gotta start, those
plyometric jump squats, you will first hate

00:39:27.880 --> 00:39:30.750
them, but one you learn to love them it will
make this go away, I promise.

00:39:30.750 --> 00:39:31.820
&gt;&gt;Female Audience Member #1: OK, thank you.

00:39:31.820 --> 00:39:34.430
&gt;&gt; Male #6: I'm asking on behalf of my wife
who's a cardio junkie.

00:39:34.430 --> 00:39:38.530
Who can probably do with some rest, because
she's worked herself into a really bad back

00:39:38.530 --> 00:39:39.530
situation.

00:39:39.530 --> 00:39:43.230
So what are some of the exercises you can
recommend for somebody who really thrives

00:39:43.230 --> 00:39:46.900
on the adrenaline, thrives on the sweat, thrives
on the cardio but needs to back off a little

00:39:46.900 --> 00:39:47.900
bit.

00:39:47.900 --> 00:39:51.490
&gt;&gt;Jordan Metzl: Alright, so we've got a wife
at home, my wife, but says the wife at home,

00:39:51.490 --> 00:39:52.800
alright fair enough.

00:39:52.800 --> 00:39:59.080
So the wife at home who's the cardio junkie
and I will say just by way of this, that yes

00:39:59.080 --> 00:40:00.630
there are junkies of exercise.

00:40:00.630 --> 00:40:04.680
Exercise junkies is a real thing but as I
always say, I'd rather somebody be addicted

00:40:04.680 --> 00:40:05.680
to exercising than anything.

00:40:05.680 --> 00:40:10.750
So be proud of your wife, but that being said
you know she's not doing enough functional

00:40:10.750 --> 00:40:14.960
training and so the cool thing about this
IronStrength workout is, I promise you, you're

00:40:14.960 --> 00:40:16.991
gonna go home, you're gonna earn a lot of
brownie points at home here.

00:40:16.991 --> 00:40:19.369
Cause you're go home and say we're gonna try
this together.

00:40:19.369 --> 00:40:23.950
And I promise you that when she gets through
her like fourth set of burpees, she's gonna

00:40:23.950 --> 00:40:26.180
be having more cardio than she ever had doing
the other stuff.

00:40:26.180 --> 00:40:29.940
So the nice thing about this is it's both
cardio and functional strength as well.

00:40:29.940 --> 00:40:33.740
But I generally find people who only do one
set of thing without that kind of cross training

00:40:33.740 --> 00:40:35.869
built in, get hurt all the time.

00:40:35.869 --> 00:40:40.040
And so this concept of total rest days, I
really don't buy that so much.

00:40:40.040 --> 00:40:42.670
I think you can do less and more and different
kinds of stuff.

00:40:42.670 --> 00:40:46.760
But I think the concept of functional training
interspersed with cardio is so helpful.

00:40:46.760 --> 00:40:48.930
So I think, try this and let me know.

00:40:48.930 --> 00:40:50.760
She will thank you and it's a huge work out.

00:40:50.760 --> 00:40:52.010
This'll be as much a workout as running.

00:40:52.010 --> 00:40:53.010
&gt;&gt; Male #6: It's in the book?

00:40:53.010 --> 00:40:55.680
&gt;&gt;Jordan Metzl: Well the pictures are in the
book and the workout's online.

00:40:55.680 --> 00:40:57.670
That’s that IronStrength on Runner's World.

00:40:57.670 --> 00:40:58.670
Alright?

00:40:58.670 --> 00:41:00.940
&gt;&gt; Male #7: Hi, thanks for the book.

00:41:00.940 --> 00:41:05.860
My biggest problem with marathons is in the
closing, you know, last three or four miles,

00:41:05.860 --> 00:41:06.940
hamstring cramps.

00:41:06.940 --> 00:41:10.490
I don't know what it is that I'm doing wrong.

00:41:10.490 --> 00:41:14.380
I've done a lot of marathons, I've had some
success but I can't seem to fend that off.

00:41:14.380 --> 00:41:15.380
&gt;&gt;Jordan Metzl: Gotcha.

00:41:15.380 --> 00:41:18.140
So muscle cramping happens for basically for
two main reasons.

00:41:18.140 --> 00:41:19.680
So I'll talk about both.

00:41:19.680 --> 00:41:22.690
Less commonly but sometimes related to muscle
cramping is actually strength.

00:41:22.690 --> 00:41:25.540
So people aren't strong enough, so I think
some of this functional training that I've

00:41:25.540 --> 00:41:28.010
been talking about will definitely help with
some people.

00:41:28.010 --> 00:41:32.130
But actually, surprisingly, more commonly
for muscle cramping that's nutritional.

00:41:32.130 --> 00:41:36.760
And when people think about nutrition and
muscle cramping people think alright I've

00:41:36.760 --> 00:41:39.900
gotta eat bananas because I'm getting muscle,
who here has had bananas for muscle cramping?

00:41:39.900 --> 00:41:41.330
Everybody got force fed bananas.

00:41:41.330 --> 00:41:45.150
And the answer is the potassium is BS, that
basically we don’t have a lot of data, we

00:41:45.150 --> 00:41:47.290
have a lot of data on sodium.

00:41:47.290 --> 00:41:51.619
And salt is the culprit for most people with
muscle cramping.

00:41:51.619 --> 00:41:55.490
And so what I'm gonna have you do, basically
what's happening over time, I'm betting in

00:41:55.490 --> 00:41:59.380
your marathons, is you're not salt loading
enough and you're not pre-salt loading and

00:41:59.380 --> 00:42:04.780
when you get that lower salt sodium hyponatremia
the first symptom is muscle cramping.

00:42:04.780 --> 00:42:08.180
So my bet is that you're what we call a salty
sweater.

00:42:08.180 --> 00:42:12.540
Everybody in this room sweats a different
amount and different concentration of sodium.

00:42:12.540 --> 00:42:15.220
And if you're a salty sweater you know it
cause when you're done with a long run you

00:42:15.220 --> 00:42:18.580
kinda look like you should be like a human
deer lick or something.

00:42:18.580 --> 00:42:21.260
You've got that white stuff all over, not
a good look.

00:42:21.260 --> 00:42:25.500
So you're a salty sweater, so if you are you
need to basically give yourself more salt

00:42:25.500 --> 00:42:30.320
along the course, and so there, you know everything
from pretzels to there are these little salt

00:42:30.320 --> 00:42:34.250
caps and I want you to try some of those and
I bet you that with some strengthening and

00:42:34.250 --> 00:42:36.690
with the sodium, it's one of those two things,
I'm betting.

00:42:36.690 --> 00:42:40.610
And you can try an experiment and see, that
if it's late in the race usually it's just

00:42:40.610 --> 00:42:42.950
that you're losing too much salt and you have
not kind of built up.

00:42:42.950 --> 00:42:46.920
You can actually pre-salt load the day before
in addition to your pasta, some extra salt

00:42:46.920 --> 00:42:50.130
and then during your exercise more than an
hour and half, start putting some more salt

00:42:50.130 --> 00:42:51.580
into what you do.

00:42:51.580 --> 00:42:55.510
And then some races have, Gatorade makes a
great product called Endurance Formula Gatorade,

00:42:55.510 --> 00:42:56.830
it's double sodium.

00:42:56.830 --> 00:42:59.850
And that has double salt and that will help
a lot in terms of sodium.

00:42:59.850 --> 00:43:02.069
So try some more salt and I bet that makes
a big difference.

00:43:02.069 --> 00:43:03.069
&gt;&gt; Male #7: Cool, thank you.

00:43:03.069 --> 00:43:06.020
Do you recommend salt caplets or just a standard
salt packet?

00:43:06.020 --> 00:43:09.660
&gt;&gt;Jordan Metzl: The salt packets don't work
cause when you get sweaty it just kind of

00:43:09.660 --> 00:43:12.840
disintegrates so they make, a number of companies
make these little, there's one called Saltstick,

00:43:12.840 --> 00:43:15.910
there's one called Endurolyte and these kind
of sodium containing capsules and you just

00:43:15.910 --> 00:43:19.290
carry those along and pop one or two of those
and I bet you'll notice.

00:43:19.290 --> 00:43:23.100
And you can kind, try and think like when
it's hot and humid am I getting this more?

00:43:23.100 --> 00:43:26.440
Is it happening I'm cold, cause cold cramping
tends to be strength.

00:43:26.440 --> 00:43:28.320
The hot humid cramping tends to be sodium.

00:43:28.320 --> 00:43:30.090
&gt;&gt; Male Audience Member #7: OK thanks.

00:43:30.090 --> 00:43:31.090
&gt;&gt;Jordan Metzl: Alright?

00:43:31.090 --> 00:43:32.090
Sure.

00:43:32.090 --> 00:43:33.920
&gt;&gt; Male #8: Hi, this is a follow up on the
potassium.

00:43:33.920 --> 00:43:38.180
I notice that a lot of people, a lot of my
friends who play sports basketball, football

00:43:38.180 --> 00:43:42.020
they started drinking a lot of coconut water,
coconut juice and I just want hear your take

00:43:42.020 --> 00:43:43.210
on that?

00:43:43.210 --> 00:43:47.870
And then more generally, after you do like
the functional training, the plyometric jumps,

00:43:47.870 --> 00:43:52.750
the burpees whatever, what's your best thing
to take in terms of recovery aside from eating

00:43:52.750 --> 00:43:53.750
right after?

00:43:53.750 --> 00:43:55.590
Like amino acids, protein etcetera.

00:43:55.590 --> 00:43:57.080
&gt;&gt;Jordan Metzl: Alright two good questions.

00:43:57.080 --> 00:43:58.080
So first with the coconut water craze.

00:43:58.080 --> 00:44:03.050
I mean I think coconut water is great it's
basically isotonic so it's kinda not high

00:44:03.050 --> 00:44:05.570
sodium, it's kinda neutral.

00:44:05.570 --> 00:44:09.241
I think eating is fine, coconut water is fine
if you like and you're gonna take it.

00:44:09.241 --> 00:44:11.970
It's probably a little more nutrient rich
than obviously water which has essentially

00:44:11.970 --> 00:44:12.970
none.

00:44:12.970 --> 00:44:14.170
But it's not like a magic formula.

00:44:14.170 --> 00:44:17.170
So people are always looking, oh I need this,
it's not a this.

00:44:17.170 --> 00:44:18.170
Just food is fine, too.

00:44:18.170 --> 00:44:19.810
But if you like that there's no down side.

00:44:19.810 --> 00:44:22.250
And if you're gonna take it, it tastes good,
no problems.

00:44:22.250 --> 00:44:24.590
It's a little expensive but no big deal.

00:44:24.590 --> 00:44:29.740
In terms of post-injury, post-workout foods,
fuels.

00:44:29.740 --> 00:44:32.540
I really don’t like the kinda powders and
all that.

00:44:32.540 --> 00:44:36.390
I know there is a whole big industry of these
synthetic powders but I just think anything

00:44:36.390 --> 00:44:41.000
that has like a half-life of six years on
the shelf is probably not a good idea.

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:42.930
And so I think just natural, natural occurring
foods.

00:44:42.930 --> 00:44:45.930
I mean get stuff that's on the perimeter of
the supermarket.

00:44:45.930 --> 00:44:50.230
Anything that's in the middle that doesn’t
expire until 2016, you know, stay away from

00:44:50.230 --> 00:44:51.660
I think in general.

00:44:51.660 --> 00:44:55.260
And it doesn't matter, it's totally you know
much like the guy asked about biking, it's

00:44:55.260 --> 00:44:57.250
whatever you will take is fine for me.

00:44:57.250 --> 00:45:01.340
That it can be scrambled eggs, it can be you
know yogurt, blueberries and granola.

00:45:01.340 --> 00:45:03.160
Whatever it is that you like, do it.

00:45:03.160 --> 00:45:07.950
And there's no magic answer to that, basically
naturally occurring food I think is the best.

00:45:07.950 --> 00:45:12.390
Some combination of carbs and protein, scrambled
eggs is great.

00:45:12.390 --> 00:45:13.720
Anything you'll do is great.

00:45:13.720 --> 00:45:14.750
Alright, no magic answer.

00:45:14.750 --> 00:45:19.830
&gt;&gt; Male #9: Hi I'm trying to get back into
a more aggressive athletic routine and a bunch

00:45:19.830 --> 00:45:25.600
of chronic injuries are sort of resurfacing.

00:45:25.600 --> 00:45:29.000
Do you recommend from a medical standpoint,
establishing a baseline whether it is trying

00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:33.100
to figure out whether it’s a meniscus or
a ligament or you know, whatever the joints

00:45:33.100 --> 00:45:34.100
are.

00:45:34.100 --> 00:45:38.850
I mean, is a baseline something to seek medical
help with to then figure out if it's getting

00:45:38.850 --> 00:45:39.850
better or worse?

00:45:39.850 --> 00:45:43.230
&gt;&gt;Jordan Metzl: That's a good question, I
mean the answer to that is that I would start

00:45:43.230 --> 00:45:46.750
doing stuff and start building some strength
and see if there's a one pinpoint thing that's

00:45:46.750 --> 00:45:47.750
the exact thing every time.

00:45:47.750 --> 00:45:51.710
If just kind of everything hurts cause you're
doing more, that tends to be kind of functional

00:45:51.710 --> 00:45:55.310
except if there's one thing that's actively
limiting your ability to be active then I

00:45:55.310 --> 00:45:56.550
would get that thing checked out.

00:45:56.550 --> 00:45:58.850
But I'm sure you have a meniscus tear, I'm
sure you do-

00:45:58.850 --> 00:45:59.850
&gt;&gt; Male #9: Yeah.

00:45:59.850 --> 00:46:00.850
&gt;&gt;Jordan Metzl: -just because many people
do.

00:46:00.850 --> 00:46:04.120
So and if we get an MRI it'll show up and
what happens is people get surgery all the

00:46:04.120 --> 00:46:07.780
time because they have a meniscus tear on
their MRI and they're no better and they've

00:46:07.780 --> 00:46:10.380
had a piece of their meniscus taken out and
they're actually worse off.

00:46:10.380 --> 00:46:14.790
And so you know I think the key is to start
doing some of the stuff I'm talking about,

00:46:14.790 --> 00:46:16.710
see how it goes, see what happens to that
pain.

00:46:16.710 --> 00:46:20.099
If there's one particular thing that's problematic,
then we can look at that further.

00:46:20.099 --> 00:46:21.099
&gt;&gt; Male Audience Member #9: OK

00:46:21.099 --> 00:46:22.099
&gt;&gt;Jordan Metzl: Alright?

00:46:22.099 --> 00:46:23.099
&gt;&gt; Male #10: Hey Jordan, thanks for coming
in.

00:46:23.099 --> 00:46:24.099
&gt;&gt;Jordan Metzl: No prob.

00:46:24.099 --> 00:46:27.730
&gt;&gt; Male #10: I try to bike at least every
day to work to and fro and I have lower back

00:46:27.730 --> 00:46:29.090
pains.

00:46:29.090 --> 00:46:30.530
What do you suggest doing?

00:46:30.530 --> 00:46:31.970
Stretching before or after or both?

00:46:31.970 --> 00:46:32.970
&gt;&gt;Jordan Metzl: Good question.

00:46:32.970 --> 00:46:34.730
So you know, how far are you biking and where
are you coming from?

00:46:34.730 --> 00:46:36.750
&gt;&gt; Male #10: I do about six or eight miles
each way.

00:46:36.750 --> 00:46:38.410
&gt;&gt;Jordan Metzl: Oh nice, and you're coming
from where abouts?

00:46:38.410 --> 00:46:39.410
&gt;&gt; Male #10: Brooklyn.

00:46:39.410 --> 00:46:40.410
&gt;&gt;Jordan Metzl: So coming over the bridge
and stuff.

00:46:40.410 --> 00:46:43.850
So you know number one is back pain from biking
can be a couple things.

00:46:43.850 --> 00:46:49.270
Number one if you're doing serious biking
like this guy maybe, bike racing or stuff,

00:46:49.270 --> 00:46:53.000
bike fit is very undervalued for you know,
making your bike comfortable.

00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:56.200
If it's kinda commuter biking and you're going
back and forth which is a great way to get

00:46:56.200 --> 00:46:59.030
around and I think getting around New York
on bike is, I'm really excited for the bike

00:46:59.030 --> 00:47:01.830
sharing program which is gonna start in July
here.

00:47:01.830 --> 00:47:05.040
Which is gonna be, anyway you guys probably
know about this stuff but it's gonna be terrific.

00:47:05.040 --> 00:47:06.040
&gt;&gt; Male #10: Great.

00:47:06.040 --> 00:47:08.900
&gt;&gt;Jordan Metzl: And I think that, you know
I have a whole bunch of stuff in the book

00:47:08.900 --> 00:47:12.480
on what's called core strengthening, isometric
planks.

00:47:12.480 --> 00:47:14.890
To build up what are the core muscles around
your middle.

00:47:14.890 --> 00:47:19.230
And most often bikers don't do enough middle
strengthening and so you kinda end up like

00:47:19.230 --> 00:47:20.230
an Oreo.

00:47:20.230 --> 00:47:23.720
You kinda have this soft inside so you gotta
start strengthening the middle.

00:47:23.720 --> 00:47:26.850
Those core muscles support you when you're
sitting on your bike seat and it makes that

00:47:26.850 --> 00:47:27.850
pain go away.

00:47:27.850 --> 00:47:31.381
So start some of the core blaster exercises
I have, some of the core strengthening and

00:47:31.381 --> 00:47:32.381
you can do it at home.

00:47:32.381 --> 00:47:34.880
Try you know a few times a week and I bet
your back feels a ton better from that.

00:47:34.880 --> 00:47:36.730
&gt;&gt; Male Audience Member #10: OK, quick question.

00:47:36.730 --> 00:47:41.290
Post long bike, chocolate milk or coconut
juice?

00:47:41.290 --> 00:47:42.810
&gt;&gt;Jordan Metzl: Take one of each.

00:47:42.810 --> 00:47:43.810
I mean, chocolate milk's got -

00:47:43.810 --> 00:47:44.810
&gt;&gt; Male #10: That's a bad combination.

00:47:44.810 --> 00:47:45.810
[Audience laughter]

00:47:45.810 --> 00:47:46.810
&gt;&gt;Jordan Metzl: Yeah it probably is.

00:47:46.810 --> 00:47:49.530
I personally, chocolate milk is probably better
cause it's a got a little more fat content

00:47:49.530 --> 00:47:50.530
and a little more carb content.

00:47:50.530 --> 00:47:55.619
So I think maybe during long ride coconut
water and post long ride I'd go with chocolate

00:47:55.619 --> 00:47:56.619
milk.

00:47:56.619 --> 00:47:57.619
&gt;&gt; Male Audience Member #10: OK, thanks.

00:47:57.619 --> 00:47:58.619
&gt;&gt;Jordan Metzl: Sure.

00:47:58.619 --> 00:47:59.619
Last question.

00:47:59.619 --> 00:48:04.960
&gt;&gt; Male #11: Hi, I don't remember if the book
addresses this in detail, I read it a while

00:48:04.960 --> 00:48:05.960
ago.

00:48:05.960 --> 00:48:07.730
Any tips for running heat?

00:48:07.730 --> 00:48:11.990
Because summer is much nastier here in New
York rather than California.

00:48:11.990 --> 00:48:15.760
&gt;&gt;Jordan Metzl: Yeah, so you know running
in New York City in the heat is a real issue.

00:48:15.760 --> 00:48:19.340
I mean, California is lucky in that sense
but you know, the biggest problem I see if

00:48:19.340 --> 00:48:20.960
you're running in the heat is acclimatization.

00:48:20.960 --> 00:48:24.220
So I have many fewer problems with people
running in the heat in August than I do in

00:48:24.220 --> 00:48:26.830
June when we get a hot day when it's been
kinda cool.

00:48:26.830 --> 00:48:30.240
So the body takes about a week to ten days
to acclimatize to heat.

00:48:30.240 --> 00:48:34.270
And so when it gradually builds up over time,
like it is now here, you know, you need a

00:48:34.270 --> 00:48:35.830
little more hydration, you probably need a
little more salt.

00:48:35.830 --> 00:48:37.420
You need to kind of pre-hydrate.

00:48:37.420 --> 00:48:40.300
You have some of these more common muscle
cramping issues.

00:48:40.300 --> 00:48:43.940
But in general your body gets to, it acclimatizes
to heat over time.

00:48:43.940 --> 00:48:48.080
The problem is if you're up here and you say
listen I'm gonna go for a getaway to Miami

00:48:48.080 --> 00:48:52.190
and it's kinda 45 here and it's 80 there,
and you get off the plane and go for a 10

00:48:52.190 --> 00:48:53.190
mile run.

00:48:53.190 --> 00:48:55.330
Those are the people that end up with a lot
of kinda of more significant.

00:48:55.330 --> 00:49:00.330
If you go run the Miami half marathon, that
weekend I always see people the next couple

00:49:00.330 --> 00:49:04.501
days with bad muscle tears because they've
just been running in the cool and they're

00:49:04.501 --> 00:49:05.501
not acclimatized.

00:49:05.501 --> 00:49:09.990
So heat tends to be the problem with acclimatization
and then you know, some of the sodium and

00:49:09.990 --> 00:49:11.990
some of the dehydration stuff as well.

00:49:11.990 --> 00:49:12.990
&gt;&gt; Male #11: Thanks.

00:49:12.990 --> 00:49:16.680
&gt;&gt;Jordan Metzl: Alright, so I just wanna say
in conclusion thank you guys so much, a pleasure

00:49:16.680 --> 00:49:17.680
to be here.

00:49:17.680 --> 00:49:22.510
I know I was competing against Justin Beiber
on Friday, but you learned some good stuff

00:49:22.510 --> 00:49:23.510
here.

00:49:23.510 --> 00:49:24.510
So I really appreciate being here, thanks
a lot.

00:49:24.510 --> 00:49:25.510
Bye-bye.

00:49:25.510 --> 00:49:25.511
[applause]
