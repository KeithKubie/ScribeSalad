00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:08.242
ALLAN WEINBERGER: Ladies and
gentlemen, Gilbert Gottfried.

00:00:08.242 --> 00:00:17.098
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:30.730
GILBERT GOTTFRIED: At least
keep clapping till I sit down.

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:32.284
Yes.

00:00:32.284 --> 00:00:34.450
ALLAN WEINBERGER: Gilbert,
thank you for joining us.

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:38.110
Over the past 40 years, you've
been one of America's leading

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:39.520
comics.

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:45.480
From backrooms of comedy
clubs, to Saturday Night Live,

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.330
to being in Disney films, you
are an exceptionally successful

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:51.850
actor as well as voice actor.

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:54.310
With that, you're also
quite controversial.

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:57.160
In 1991, you were
banned from the Emmys,

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:00.310
and presumably are the reason
why they are on time delay.

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:02.950
You were accredited with
being the first comic

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:07.120
to make a 9/11 joke on 9/29.

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:09.910
And you were publicly
released from your endorsement

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:12.820
by Aflac for making
tsunami jokes

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:15.320
during the Japanese tsunami.

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.850
So with all of that,
where should we start?

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:23.410
GILBERT GOTTFRIED: Well, never
take career advice from me.

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:25.630
That's the most important thing.

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:27.640
Yeah, any place you want to.

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.850
ALLAN WEINBERGER: Well,
welcome to Google.

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:32.500
Is this your first time here?

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:32.860
GILBERT GOTTFRIED: The what?

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:33.760
ALLAN WEINBERGER:
Welcome to Google.

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:34.718
GILBERT GOTTFRIED: Yes.

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.640
I just want to come back
here for the kitchens.

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.640
They have these big--

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.692
it's amazing, the kitchens here.

00:01:46.692 --> 00:01:47.650
ALLAN WEINBERGER: Yeah.

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:50.770
Right beforehand, I took
Gilbert to find some cookies.

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:54.400
And it was about a
20-minute expedition.

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.130
So let me ask you-- in
your 40-year career,

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:59.080
when did you get
your first break?

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:01.180
What was your first moment?

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:04.030
GILBERT GOTTFRIED: I
got some false starts.

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.270
I was a cast member of
"Saturday Night Live"

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:15.370
in the season from
'80 to '81, where

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:19.480
it was right after the
original cast had left.

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:26.110
And back then, "Saturday Night
Live" with a different cast

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:30.310
would be like if, in
mid-season of "Friends,"

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:33.220
they changed all
the actors on you.

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:36.160
And said, just watch
the show, and just act

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.490
like they're the same people.

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:42.600
Now the cast on "Saturday
Night" changes in

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.960
between commercial break.

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:49.360
But that was an outrage.

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:52.780
They were panning the show
before it got on the air.

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:55.080
So that was awful.

00:02:55.080 --> 00:03:03.120
And then my next big break
was "Thicke of the Night."

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.960
That was Alan Thicke's
talk show that

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:12.390
was advertised as it was going
to kick Carson off the air.

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:16.086
And if you notice, Carson's
not on the air anymore, so--

00:03:16.086 --> 00:03:19.560
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.230
So he was right.

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:26.090
And that was a horrible bomb.

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:28.226
ALLAN WEINBERGER: [LAUGHS]

00:03:28.226 --> 00:03:30.100
GILBERT GOTTFRIED: And
then, not even trying,

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:33.870
I was back to Catch
a Rising Star,

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:36.180
where I would go up on stage.

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:40.390
And someone saw me there--
this woman comes over,

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:43.670
she says, I work for MTV.

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:46.080
We're having some
auditions tomorrow.

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:51.060
So I showed up there and
started improvising stuff.

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:55.640
And next thing I know, they
just took the audition tape

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:58.730
and were showing it on MTV.

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:00.980
ALLAN WEINBERGER: Did you
get paid for that, at least?

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:03.710
GILBERT GOTTFRIED: Well
that's another thing.

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:05.390
I call them.

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:08.570
And I said, should
I be getting paid?

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:13.340
Once I brought it up, they paid
me a couple hundred dollars.

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:17.220
And the minute William
Morris found out about it,

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:20.220
they took out 10%.

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:22.700
They had nothing to do with it.

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:25.490
But that was my
first big break--

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:27.585
the MTV spots.

00:04:27.585 --> 00:04:28.460
ALLAN WEINBERGER: OK.

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:32.420
And then I'm always interested
in about how comics made it

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:33.950
to "Saturday Night Live."

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:35.030
What was your path there?

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:40.370
GILBERT GOTTFRIED: I was
known as a stand-up comic.

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:46.100
And not big places, just
Catch and stuff like that.

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:50.030
And then they were
holding auditions.

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:54.500
So they saw me at
the clubs on stage,

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:59.195
and then they called me in
to audition in their offices.

00:04:59.195 --> 00:05:00.820
ALLAN WEINBERGER:
And you had to do it.

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:02.600
Was it the tight five?

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:05.930
GILBERT GOTTFRIED: Yeah, I
don't remember how tight it was,

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:09.069
with the way I operate.

00:05:09.069 --> 00:05:10.610
ALLAN WEINBERGER:
Well, that's great.

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:15.230
So throughout your
40-year career,

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:17.240
there's been a lot that's
changed in the world.

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:20.032
And we've moved a lot
to a digital landscape.

00:05:20.032 --> 00:05:20.990
GILBERT GOTTFRIED: Yeah

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:22.614
ALLAN WEINBERGER:
We're here at Google.

00:05:22.614 --> 00:05:26.160
How has digital, social media--

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:29.120
how has this
changed your career?

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:31.400
GILBERT GOTTFRIED:
Well, I've always

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:36.650
said I find the internet
makes me feel sentimental

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:39.312
for old-time lynch mobs.

00:05:39.312 --> 00:05:42.230
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:46.000
'Cause you've got to admire
people in the old lynch mobs.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.100
At least they had to put
their shoes on, go out,

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:53.840
get their hands dirty,
and actually do something.

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:55.820
Now it's these
lynch mobs where you

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:57.940
sit in your underwear
on the couch,

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:00.350
and you make up your own.

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:05.610
It's very strange,
because the business has--

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:11.910
the second I thought I had a
vague idea of how show business

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:13.679
worked, it all changed.

00:06:13.679 --> 00:06:14.970
ALLAN WEINBERGER: With digital?

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:15.600
GILBERT GOTTFRIED: Yeah.

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:16.474
ALLAN WEINBERGER: OK.

00:06:16.474 --> 00:06:19.530
And was this with
Twitter that came out?

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:21.510
Or was there anything
in particular

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:22.430
where you realized
it was a change?

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:23.971
GILBERT GOTTFRIED:
Oh, so many things

00:06:23.971 --> 00:06:27.120
I don't even know the name of.

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:32.090
It's like if you were to say
to me, oh, name some big star.

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:37.740
So in my mind, it would be
Tom Cruise and Julia Roberts.

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:40.710
But on the internet,
there's people

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:47.850
who get 9, 10 billion
times the amount of views

00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:52.290
that those two would
get, together in a movie.

00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:57.120
And at comedy clubs
sometimes, they'll

00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:00.360
get someone from
the internet, who

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:05.105
shows how he squeezes his
blackheads or whatever.

00:07:05.105 --> 00:07:08.290
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:08.290 --> 00:07:10.080
And he's there.

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:12.630
And it's a mob scene.

00:07:12.630 --> 00:07:14.880
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:18.120
ALLAN WEINBERGER:
So now, if you don't

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:24.200
mind, when you have a bad set,
let's say, back in the '80s.

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:25.680
You tell a bad joke.

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:27.587
Maybe it's a terribly
offensive joke.

00:07:27.587 --> 00:07:28.170
You regret it.

00:07:28.170 --> 00:07:29.220
You never tell it again.

00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:30.950
You kind of get off Scot free.

00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:32.070
GILBERT GOTTFRIED: Yeah.

00:07:32.070 --> 00:07:34.195
ALLAN WEINBERGER: Kind of
changed a little bit now.

00:07:34.195 --> 00:07:35.930
You tell a bad tsunami
joke on Twitter,

00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:36.994
you lose a lot of money.

00:07:36.994 --> 00:07:38.160
GILBERT GOTTFRIED: Oh, yeah.

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:40.485
It's all over the planet.

00:07:44.015 --> 00:07:46.140
ALLAN WEINBERGER: How do
you feel about comedy, now

00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:48.510
that comedians aren't
really given the right

00:07:48.510 --> 00:07:50.550
to tell bad jokes anymore?

00:07:50.550 --> 00:07:51.550
GILBERT GOTTFRIED: Yeah.

00:07:51.550 --> 00:07:54.850
It's very strange,
because there's

00:07:54.850 --> 00:07:58.960
a line that George
Carlin said, that it's

00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:03.730
the duty of a comedian to find
out where the line is drawn,

00:08:03.730 --> 00:08:07.330
and then deliberately
cross over it.

00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:11.262
And now, if you cross
over it, it's forgetting.

00:08:11.262 --> 00:08:12.220
ALLAN WEINBERGER: Well.

00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:14.230
Very true.

00:08:14.230 --> 00:08:19.810
Then in that topic, we
hear it all the time

00:08:19.810 --> 00:08:23.830
with a lot of new comedians
such as Anthony Jeselnik where

00:08:23.830 --> 00:08:27.310
it's, is there a time
when it is too soon?

00:08:27.310 --> 00:08:31.750
Or it is too taboo, you're not
allowed to touch that topic.

00:08:31.750 --> 00:08:33.250
How dare you?

00:08:33.250 --> 00:08:36.044
What are your thoughts on that?

00:08:36.044 --> 00:08:37.419
GILBERT GOTTFRIED:
I kind of feel

00:08:37.419 --> 00:08:43.330
like you could make an
argument for my case,

00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:47.410
and say, I'm more
sensitive, joking

00:08:47.410 --> 00:08:51.449
while a tragedy's going on.

00:08:51.449 --> 00:08:55.710
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:55.710 --> 00:08:58.750
Because at least when
I tell a joke, when

00:08:58.750 --> 00:09:03.110
the tragedy is going on,
their reaction is, oh my god.

00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:06.140
They'll start to laugh, and
then cover their faces, and go,

00:09:06.140 --> 00:09:07.900
oh, I shouldn't be
laughing at that.

00:09:07.900 --> 00:09:09.430
That's horrible.

00:09:09.430 --> 00:09:12.130
This is a horrible tragedy.

00:09:12.130 --> 00:09:15.310
So their reaction,
when I'm doing it,

00:09:15.310 --> 00:09:17.500
is acknowledging-- yes.

00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:21.520
This is a horrible tragedy.

00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:25.230
If you're a good
person and you wait--

00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:29.080
and you could do a Titanic
joke, and no one cares.

00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:30.870
ALLAN WEINBERGER: Sure.

00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:32.382
Maybe not in 1914, but yeah.

00:09:32.382 --> 00:09:33.340
GILBERT GOTTFRIED: Yes.

00:09:33.340 --> 00:09:37.240
So if you do it now, to
show you're sensitive

00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:41.800
and then time has past,
what you're saying is,

00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:43.510
enough time has passed--

00:09:43.510 --> 00:09:47.160
fuck all the people who
died on the Titanic.

00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:49.000
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.996
And that's sensitivity.

00:09:51.996 --> 00:09:53.730
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:53.730 --> 00:09:55.566
ALLAN WEINBERGER: There.

00:09:55.566 --> 00:09:58.520
[APPLAUSE]

00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:02.680
GILBERT GOTTFRIED: And I
love when people say to me,

00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:05.740
how can you make
jokes on these topics?

00:10:05.740 --> 00:10:10.480
Aren't you aware of the
tragedy and loss of life?

00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:12.520
And I always go, yeah.

00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:15.120
That's where the
joke stems from.

00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:18.049
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:18.049 --> 00:10:19.840
ALLAN WEINBERGER: Now,
to talk specifically

00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:21.850
about one of those moments.

00:10:21.850 --> 00:10:27.740
In 2001, at the Friar's Club,
the roast of Hugh Hefner.

00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:29.860
Very famous moment for you.

00:10:29.860 --> 00:10:33.940
You told the first
9/11 joke-- or at least

00:10:33.940 --> 00:10:35.590
the famous person that told it.

00:10:35.590 --> 00:10:37.270
to a roomful of comics.

00:10:37.270 --> 00:10:41.370
And all of them, within a
moment, they were just shook.

00:10:41.370 --> 00:10:42.370
GILBERT GOTTFRIED: Yeah.

00:10:42.370 --> 00:10:43.745
ALLAN WEINBERGER:
And then it was

00:10:43.745 --> 00:10:47.710
thought that you continued
to dig a hole until you got

00:10:47.710 --> 00:10:49.146
to the other side of the Earth.

00:10:49.146 --> 00:10:50.520
GILBERT GOTTFRIED:
Yeah, I mean--

00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:52.875
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:52.875 --> 00:10:56.620
The audience immediately
turned on me.

00:10:56.620 --> 00:10:57.730
And it was like--

00:10:57.730 --> 00:10:59.813
ALLAN WEINBERGER: How did
you feel in that moment?

00:10:59.813 --> 00:11:03.040
GILBERT GOTTFRIED: Oh, they
were booing and hissing.

00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:05.920
One guy yelled out,
too soon, which

00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:08.530
I thought meant I didn't
take a long enough pause

00:11:08.530 --> 00:11:12.160
between the set-up
and punchline.

00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:14.560
But oh!

00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:19.270
I felt like if you
said, that time right

00:11:19.270 --> 00:11:24.970
after I said the 9/11 joke, if
I was up there for 200 years

00:11:24.970 --> 00:11:26.680
after that, I'd believe it.

00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:29.560
That's what it felt like.

00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:32.650
And then I go into
the aristocrats joke,

00:11:32.650 --> 00:11:35.170
because I felt like
I might as well go

00:11:35.170 --> 00:11:38.170
to the bottom level in hell.

00:11:38.170 --> 00:11:39.140
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:39.140 --> 00:11:44.770
And it turned it all around,
and they were howling.

00:11:44.770 --> 00:11:47.740
They burst out laughing.

00:11:47.740 --> 00:11:52.410
And one critic said
it was cathartic.

00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:02.930
One critic said, it's like I
performed a mass tracheotomy

00:12:02.930 --> 00:12:05.570
on the crowd.

00:12:05.570 --> 00:12:09.990
Because people just need to
be able to laugh at times

00:12:09.990 --> 00:12:11.400
like that.

00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:12.810
ALLAN WEINBERGER: Absolutely.

00:12:12.810 --> 00:12:15.882
So you're working on
a few projects now.

00:12:15.882 --> 00:12:17.340
The reason why
you're here today is

00:12:17.340 --> 00:12:18.840
you have a documentary
that releases

00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:20.880
tomorrow named "Gilbert."

00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:23.387
GILBERT GOTTFRIED: I won't tell
you what the story's about.

00:12:23.387 --> 00:12:24.820
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:24.820 --> 00:12:28.470
It's kind of like "A Hat
Full of Rain" or something.

00:12:28.470 --> 00:12:31.220
Later on in the
play, you go, oh!

00:12:31.220 --> 00:12:33.470
That's what they meant
by hat full of rain.

00:12:33.470 --> 00:12:34.210
Yeah.

00:12:34.210 --> 00:12:35.426
ALLAN WEINBERGER: So we're
going to talk about your--

00:12:35.426 --> 00:12:37.467
[LAUGHS] I don't even know
where to go with that.

00:12:37.467 --> 00:12:39.302
GILBERT GOTTFRIED: Yeah.

00:12:39.302 --> 00:12:42.360
[IN DRAMATIC VOICE] He died
the death of a salesman,

00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:43.841
with his red velvet--

00:12:43.841 --> 00:12:44.340
oh.

00:12:44.340 --> 00:12:45.290
"Death of a Salesman."

00:12:45.290 --> 00:12:46.432
OK.

00:12:46.432 --> 00:12:48.229
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:48.229 --> 00:12:49.770
ALLAN WEINBERGER:
We're going to talk

00:12:49.770 --> 00:12:52.670
about "Gilbert" in a moment.

00:12:52.670 --> 00:12:54.150
But you have a podcast.

00:12:54.150 --> 00:12:54.980
Can you tell us a little
bit about your podcast?

00:12:54.980 --> 00:12:55.938
GILBERT GOTTFRIED: Yes.

00:12:55.938 --> 00:12:59.080
It's called, "Gilbert
Gottfried's Amazing Colossal

00:12:59.080 --> 00:13:00.900
Podcast."

00:13:00.900 --> 00:13:07.950
And it's me and my
co-host, Frank Santopadre.

00:13:07.950 --> 00:13:12.390
And we concentrate
on old Hollywood.

00:13:12.390 --> 00:13:17.400
Like the Hollywood of just the
old movies and old TV shows.

00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:24.780
And in a certain
way, it's reminiscent

00:13:24.780 --> 00:13:27.380
of like "The Love Boat"
or "Fantasy Island"

00:13:27.380 --> 00:13:28.960
where these people--

00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:32.340
either, one, you didn't know
about in the first place,

00:13:32.340 --> 00:13:34.980
or two, you thought were dead.

00:13:34.980 --> 00:13:36.840
And now you see
them and go, wow.

00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:38.070
They're as good as ever.

00:13:40.262 --> 00:13:42.470
ALLAN WEINBERGER: Who are
you interviewing for these?

00:13:42.470 --> 00:13:45.340
And how often are
you showcasing this?

00:13:45.340 --> 00:13:48.662
GILBERT GOTTFRIED:
It's on every week.

00:13:48.662 --> 00:13:50.370
ALLAN WEINBERGER:
Where do you record it?

00:13:50.370 --> 00:13:54.070
GILBERT GOTTFRIED: At
a studio called Nutmeg.

00:13:54.070 --> 00:13:56.940
It's a voiceover place, mainly.

00:13:56.940 --> 00:14:03.330
And we've had on Carl Reiner,
Dick Van Dyke, Bruce Dern,

00:14:03.330 --> 00:14:06.510
and Judd Apatow was on--

00:14:06.510 --> 00:14:07.626
he was the youngest.

00:14:07.626 --> 00:14:09.000
ALLAN WEINBERGER:
Mainly focusing

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:10.984
on the legendary comics?

00:14:10.984 --> 00:14:12.150
GILBERT GOTTFRIED: Oh, yeah.

00:14:12.150 --> 00:14:16.980
Legendary comics,
actors, directors.

00:14:16.980 --> 00:14:20.007
Peter Bogdanovich was on.

00:14:20.007 --> 00:14:22.590
ALLAN WEINBERGER: So you mention
that this is filmed in your--

00:14:22.590 --> 00:14:27.840
do you use this theater or this
studio as your voiceover stage,

00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:28.550
as well?

00:14:28.550 --> 00:14:29.370
Do you do a lot--

00:14:29.370 --> 00:14:32.269
GILBERT GOTTFRIED: I've done
lots of voiceovers there, yeah.

00:14:32.269 --> 00:14:34.560
ALLAN WEINBERGER: So do you
enjoy doing voiceover work?

00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:35.460
Or do you prefer on film?

00:14:35.460 --> 00:14:36.626
GILBERT GOTTFRIED: Oh, yeah.

00:14:36.626 --> 00:14:40.070
As long as I can hold onto
the job for, I enjoy it.

00:14:40.070 --> 00:14:42.570
ALLAN WEINBERGER: One thing
that I love about your voiceover

00:14:42.570 --> 00:14:50.190
work is that you can take the
most boring, bland articles,

00:14:50.190 --> 00:14:54.772
and turn them into
something hilarious.

00:14:54.772 --> 00:14:56.230
GILBERT GOTTFRIED:
On the internet,

00:14:56.230 --> 00:14:59.970
you could find "Gilbert
Gottfried Reads 'Fifty Shades

00:14:59.970 --> 00:15:01.284
of Gray.'"

00:15:01.284 --> 00:15:02.490
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:02.490 --> 00:15:05.526
ALLAN WEINBERGER: Well,
we can't do that today.

00:15:05.526 --> 00:15:06.900
GILBERT GOTTFRIED: [LAUGHS]

00:15:06.900 --> 00:15:09.220
ALLAN WEINBERGER:
I do love my job.

00:15:09.220 --> 00:15:10.380
And I'd like to keep that.

00:15:10.380 --> 00:15:16.050
But I did research probably
the most boring, bland piece

00:15:16.050 --> 00:15:19.440
of Google literature
that you could read,

00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:22.020
and it's our Q3 earnings report.

00:15:22.020 --> 00:15:24.930
And I was wondering if you would
take a stab at livening this

00:15:24.930 --> 00:15:25.660
up a little bit?

00:15:25.660 --> 00:15:26.460
GILBERT GOTTFRIED: OK.

00:15:26.460 --> 00:15:27.626
ALLAN WEINBERGER: All right.

00:15:27.626 --> 00:15:28.990
So if I brought this for you.

00:15:28.990 --> 00:15:30.550
Now, this just came out.

00:15:30.550 --> 00:15:32.040
We did fine.

00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:34.265
So you might need
some reading glasses.

may be considered
forward looking,

These standards involve a number
of risks and uncertainties

00:16:40.730 --> 00:16:45.760

results to differ--

you're listening--

I'm sure he's available.

00:17:44.650 --> 00:17:46.570
I don't know if
we can afford it,

00:17:46.570 --> 00:17:49.710
but it might liven up these
reports just a little bit.

00:17:49.710 --> 00:17:52.060

like to show the trailer.

talent, and comedian.

- The great Gilbert Gottfried.

00:18:34.290 --> 00:18:35.950
- I don't know how
I know Gilbert.

He's always been
in the Zeitgeist.

00:18:38.282 --> 00:18:40.460
- You know his voice
as soon as you hear it.

- Oh, stop!

00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:43.810
- He doesn't really
filter himself.

00:18:43.810 --> 00:18:46.150
And I think that's why
people are drawn to him.

you could say to me

I'm so tired of.

- People assume he's

That's the furthest
thing from the truth.

shy person off stage.

see him when he's not on.

00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:40.560
- Lot of memories being here.

00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:43.940
- My father-- he used to get
very angry about my brother.

00:19:43.940 --> 00:19:45.620
- I dropped out of high school.

00:19:45.620 --> 00:19:50.114
I'm sure my father thought,
he's the loser of the group.

00:19:50.114 --> 00:19:52.210
- There's always
a little surprise

00:19:52.210 --> 00:19:53.329
that he became a husband.

00:19:53.329 --> 00:19:54.120
- Nice to meet you.

00:19:54.120 --> 00:19:54.660
- Yeah.

00:19:54.660 --> 00:19:55.640
- And a dad.

00:19:55.640 --> 00:19:58.065
- Is your dad funny?

00:19:58.065 --> 00:20:00.010
- Not really.

00:20:00.010 --> 00:20:02.080
- He seems like a gentle soul.

00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:04.990
But a gentle soul was not
usually loud and obnoxious.

00:20:04.990 --> 00:20:07.840
- [LAUGHS]

00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:10.140
- Gilbert's somewhere between
Mark Twain and a birthday

00:20:10.140 --> 00:20:10.674
clown.

00:20:10.674 --> 00:20:12.090
- There's an
explosiveness to him.

00:20:12.090 --> 00:20:13.396
- He's the real deal.

00:20:13.396 --> 00:20:14.270
[BRASS MUSIC PLAYING]

00:20:14.270 --> 00:20:17.554
- Hey, I don't like the
way you're talking to her.

00:20:17.554 --> 00:20:20.050
Come on, you and me are
gonna have to tangle.

00:20:20.050 --> 00:20:22.011
And you too.

[DRUM MUSIC PLAYING]

00:20:22.965 --> 00:20:24.396
- Fetch this.

00:20:24.396 --> 00:20:26.310
- Remember, this
is a family show.

00:20:26.310 --> 00:20:26.956
- Yes, I know.

00:20:26.956 --> 00:20:28.962
That's the first
thing you told me.

00:20:28.962 --> 00:20:34.107
[LAUGHS] That's the first
thing everyone tells me.

00:20:34.690 --> 00:20:39.790
[APPLAUSE]

00:20:39.790 --> 00:20:42.040
ALLAN WEINBERGER: And please
welcome to the stage Dara

00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:44.618
Gottfried and Neil Berkley.

00:20:44.618 --> 00:20:48.010
[APPLAUSE]

00:20:48.010 --> 00:20:48.510
Welcome.

00:20:52.300 --> 00:20:55.800
So Neil, you directed this film.

00:20:55.800 --> 00:20:56.670
NEIL BERKELEY: Yes.

00:20:56.670 --> 00:20:59.250
ALLAN WEINBERGER: And
you pitched the idea.

00:20:59.250 --> 00:21:02.000
How did this come about?

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:03.900
NEIL BERKELEY: I just
started telling people

00:21:03.900 --> 00:21:05.700
that I'm going to make a
Gilbert Gottfried movie.

00:21:05.700 --> 00:21:07.450
And I would tell anyone
that would listen,

00:21:07.450 --> 00:21:08.290
I'm going to make--

00:21:08.290 --> 00:21:10.415
no, I never tried to call
his agent or his manager.

00:21:10.415 --> 00:21:11.330
Never reached out.

00:21:11.330 --> 00:21:12.810
Never really tried to do it.

00:21:12.810 --> 00:21:14.852
Just I started telling
people I'm going to do it.

00:21:14.852 --> 00:21:16.810
And then one day, I was
walking down 6th Avenue

00:21:16.810 --> 00:21:18.240
with this woman
named Astrid Dorf.

00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:20.370
And she said, what's your
next movie going to be about?

00:21:20.370 --> 00:21:22.745
And I said, oh, it's going to
be about Gilbert Gottfried.

00:21:22.745 --> 00:21:24.270
And she goes,
well, that's weird.

00:21:24.270 --> 00:21:25.196
And I go, what?

00:21:25.196 --> 00:21:26.070
I was like-- oh, man.

00:21:26.070 --> 00:21:28.380
She hates Gilbert Gottfried.

00:21:28.380 --> 00:21:30.840
She goes, it's weird because
his wife is my best friend.

00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:32.380
And they live right over there.

00:21:32.380 --> 00:21:34.612
And so I had a drink
with Dara that night,

00:21:34.612 --> 00:21:35.820
and met Gilbert the next day.

00:21:35.820 --> 00:21:37.880
And he said, don't do this.

00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:39.180
This is a bad idea.

00:21:39.180 --> 00:21:40.080
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:42.679
And then, seven months later,
Dara called and said, look.

00:21:42.679 --> 00:21:43.470
I like your movies.

00:21:43.470 --> 00:21:44.050
I like you.

00:21:44.050 --> 00:21:44.820
And we're not doing anything.

00:21:44.820 --> 00:21:46.530
So just come out
with your camera,

00:21:46.530 --> 00:21:48.280
and maybe he won't
notice you're here.

00:21:48.280 --> 00:21:49.020
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:49.020 --> 00:21:50.219
And so I moved to New York.

00:21:50.219 --> 00:21:52.260
And I slept on my buddy's
couch for seven months.

00:21:52.260 --> 00:21:54.460
And I would just go to
their house every day.

00:21:54.460 --> 00:21:56.670
ALLAN WEINBERGER: And
before you started,

00:21:56.670 --> 00:21:58.290
what was the one
thing that you wanted

00:21:58.290 --> 00:21:59.610
to make sure you captured?

00:21:59.610 --> 00:22:00.660
NEIL BERKELEY: My
goal with this--

00:22:00.660 --> 00:22:01.920
I told Dara halfway
through, I said,

00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:03.503
look-- all I really
want to do is make

00:22:03.503 --> 00:22:05.370
a movie that comedians love.

00:22:05.370 --> 00:22:07.620
I said, I just want to
capture what that's like.

00:22:07.620 --> 00:22:09.900
And my goal-- and whether
we did it or not--

00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:12.720
is to make the movie that
every comic has to go

00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:14.700
see when they
start the business.

00:22:14.700 --> 00:22:16.445
And I don't know if
we did it or not.

00:22:16.445 --> 00:22:17.320
But that was my goal.

00:22:17.320 --> 00:22:20.400
I wanted to capture what it's
like to be a comic who still

00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:22.980
tours every weekend, who's
still in clubs, who's still

00:22:22.980 --> 00:22:26.550
working and raising a family
after 45 years in the business.

00:22:26.550 --> 00:22:29.070
ALLAN WEINBERGER:
And Dara, when you

00:22:29.070 --> 00:22:31.470
had this first meeting, what
were your initial thoughts?

00:22:31.470 --> 00:22:34.620
DARA GOTTFRIED: Well,
basically I met Neil,

00:22:34.620 --> 00:22:36.690
and he offered to take
Gilbert out to lunch.

00:22:36.690 --> 00:22:40.720
And anyone that wants to pay
for Gilbert for a free meal,

00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:41.820
he's happy to--

00:22:41.820 --> 00:22:43.820
ALLAN WEINBERGER: By the
way, in the green room,

00:22:43.820 --> 00:22:46.670
he kept asking how he could eat
lunch here every single day.

00:22:46.670 --> 00:22:47.550
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:47.550 --> 00:22:48.540
DARA GOTTFRIED: He's serious
about this, by the way!

00:22:48.540 --> 00:22:49.860
NEIL BERKELEY: I don't
think he's joking.

00:22:49.860 --> 00:22:51.180
ALLAN WEINBERGER: And this
came up multiple times.

00:22:51.180 --> 00:22:52.515
DARA GOTTFRIED: Seriously.

00:22:52.515 --> 00:22:54.210
NEIL BERKELEY: We'll put a
piece of paper in the bag.

00:22:54.210 --> 00:22:55.830
Just put your name
and number on it,

00:22:55.830 --> 00:22:57.900
and Gilbert will call
each of you every day.

00:22:57.900 --> 00:22:59.139
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:59.139 --> 00:23:00.930
ALLAN WEINBERGER: I'm
looking at paperwork,

00:23:00.930 --> 00:23:02.460
and Allen Seals walks in.

00:23:02.460 --> 00:23:05.970
And he asks Allen the
same exact question.

00:23:05.970 --> 00:23:09.910
GILBERT GOTTFRIED: It's like,
if there's a free meal in it,

00:23:09.910 --> 00:23:12.659
I'll have lunch with
the head of ISIS.

00:23:12.659 --> 00:23:17.631
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:17.631 --> 00:23:20.130
DARA GOTTFRIED: So basically,
he took Gilbert out for lunch,

00:23:20.130 --> 00:23:22.290
and Gilbert came home.

00:23:22.290 --> 00:23:23.500
And I said, how did it go?

00:23:23.500 --> 00:23:24.660
And he's like, eh--

00:23:24.660 --> 00:23:26.150
the food was good.

00:23:26.150 --> 00:23:29.820
So basically he said, you know,
documentaries are basically

00:23:29.820 --> 00:23:32.119
for when you're dead
or find a cure for.

00:23:32.119 --> 00:23:33.660
GILBERT GOTTFRIED:
Or yeah, if you've

00:23:33.660 --> 00:23:38.392
opened up a bunch of schools
in a third-world country.

00:23:38.392 --> 00:23:39.229
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:39.229 --> 00:23:41.020
DARA GOTTFRIED: So he
wasn't into the idea.

00:23:41.020 --> 00:23:43.530
But Neil, I just felt really--

00:23:43.530 --> 00:23:46.650
he's such a talented director.

00:23:46.650 --> 00:23:48.030
I loved his movies.

00:23:48.030 --> 00:23:51.900
His passion for Gilbert
was like no other.

00:23:51.900 --> 00:23:56.520
And he just was really
passionate about this project.

00:23:56.520 --> 00:23:59.010
He sent me a handwritten
note on parchment paper.

00:23:59.010 --> 00:23:59.340
I mean, it was so classy.

00:23:59.340 --> 00:24:00.470
NEIL BERKELEY: No one
does that anymore.

00:24:00.470 --> 00:24:02.178
DARA GOTTFRIED: No
one does that anymore.

00:24:02.178 --> 00:24:03.630
And he was very persistent.

00:24:03.630 --> 00:24:06.240
And I finally said, Gilbert
couldn't make a decision.

00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:10.140
And I finally said, Neil,
just come out for one week.

00:24:10.140 --> 00:24:11.070
Try it.

00:24:11.070 --> 00:24:12.870
If Gilbert's
comfortable, you'll stay.

00:24:12.870 --> 00:24:15.130
And if not, at least
you said you tried.

00:24:15.130 --> 00:24:16.930
And the next day he
was on the plane.

00:24:16.930 --> 00:24:18.388
GILBERT GOTTFRIED:
Neil said to me,

00:24:18.388 --> 00:24:21.840
he goes, I've always wanted
to make a Gilbert Gottfried

00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:23.370
documentary.

00:24:23.370 --> 00:24:25.440
And I said, well, you
know you should set

00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:27.816
your aspirations a lot higher.

00:24:27.816 --> 00:24:28.510
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:28.510 --> 00:24:32.624
You know, start off with
a Yakov Smirnoff one.

00:24:32.624 --> 00:24:34.519
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:34.519 --> 00:24:36.810
NEIL BERKELEY: The first day
I shot, I went over there.

00:24:36.810 --> 00:24:39.430
And Dara and the kids were going
to school, so no one's there.

00:24:39.430 --> 00:24:41.010
And the elevator opens
up, and Gilbert's

00:24:41.010 --> 00:24:43.176
standing there in his
bathrobe with a cup of coffee.

00:24:43.176 --> 00:24:44.807
And I had my camera
and all my stuff.

00:24:44.807 --> 00:24:46.890
And I said, I'm Neil, and
we met a few months ago.

00:24:46.890 --> 00:24:50.190
Dara said I can come make
a documentary about you.

00:24:50.190 --> 00:24:52.380
And he goes, oh.

00:24:52.380 --> 00:24:53.730
And I said, did she tell you?

00:24:53.730 --> 00:24:55.450
And he goes, no.

00:24:55.450 --> 00:24:56.370
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:56.370 --> 00:24:59.458
And then he just turned around
and walked away from me.

00:24:59.458 --> 00:25:00.587
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:00.587 --> 00:25:01.545
But it's weird, though.

00:25:01.545 --> 00:25:02.490
The way I work is--

00:25:02.490 --> 00:25:03.780
I shot it myself.

00:25:03.780 --> 00:25:04.989
So it's just me and a camera.

00:25:04.989 --> 00:25:06.571
There's no lights
or crew or anything.

00:25:06.571 --> 00:25:08.250
So in my head, I'm
always thinking,

00:25:08.250 --> 00:25:10.200
do they think this is real?

00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:12.040
It looks like I'm
making a home movie.

00:25:12.040 --> 00:25:13.831
DARA GOTTFRIED: That's
what's it felt like.

00:25:13.831 --> 00:25:14.886
It didn't feel real.

00:25:14.886 --> 00:25:15.886
GILBERT GOTTFRIED: Yeah.

00:25:15.886 --> 00:25:21.240
It was like someone from TMZ
spotting you, and holding

00:25:21.240 --> 00:25:22.980
a camera.

00:25:22.980 --> 00:25:25.530
No crew, nothing.

00:25:25.530 --> 00:25:28.470
ALLAN WEINBERGER: So you
act as his quasi manager?

00:25:28.470 --> 00:25:28.980
Is that--

00:25:28.980 --> 00:25:29.730
DARA GOTTFRIED: Yeah.

00:25:29.730 --> 00:25:30.480
By default, yeah.

00:25:30.480 --> 00:25:36.169
ALLAN WEINBERGER: By default.
So in the documentary,

00:25:36.169 --> 00:25:37.710
and hopefully everyone
will watch it.

00:25:37.710 --> 00:25:39.420
It comes out tomorrow.

00:25:39.420 --> 00:25:41.642
In the documentary,
you're very endearing.

00:25:41.642 --> 00:25:42.600
DARA GOTTFRIED: Thanks.

00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:45.420
ALLAN WEINBERGER: And you
commonly ask, what are you

00:25:45.420 --> 00:25:47.070
going to do in your act?

00:25:47.070 --> 00:25:50.790
And is this Gilbert?

00:25:50.790 --> 00:25:53.680
Is this an act?

00:25:53.680 --> 00:25:56.360
Would you say that
that is a character?

00:25:56.360 --> 00:25:58.360
DARA GOTTFRIED: I think
it's part of you, right?

00:25:58.360 --> 00:25:59.526
It's not really a character.

00:25:59.526 --> 00:26:00.800
It's just part of who you are.

00:26:00.800 --> 00:26:02.300
GILBERT GOTTFRIED: Yeah.

00:26:02.300 --> 00:26:03.460
It's very weird.

00:26:03.460 --> 00:26:06.450
It's kind of like
Jekyll and Hyde.

00:26:06.450 --> 00:26:09.160
And it's like, later
on in the story,

00:26:09.160 --> 00:26:13.600
it's hard to distinguish
between the two of them,

00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:16.650
because they keep
going back and forth.

00:26:16.650 --> 00:26:20.710
And so I feel like
neither one of them.

00:26:20.710 --> 00:26:24.256
You could say, OK, this
is the real one by now.

00:26:24.256 --> 00:26:26.380
NEIL BERKELEY: You said
something interesting to me

00:26:26.380 --> 00:26:27.190
pretty recently.

00:26:27.190 --> 00:26:29.140
We were talking about
that, and people--

00:26:29.140 --> 00:26:32.290
I've seen so many people do
horrible Gilbert Gottfried

00:26:32.290 --> 00:26:34.180
impressions to
Gilbert Gottfried.

00:26:34.180 --> 00:26:34.930
Don't do it.

00:26:34.930 --> 00:26:37.620
Don't come up to him,
and don't do the voice.

00:26:37.620 --> 00:26:38.710
Just avoid it.

00:26:38.710 --> 00:26:40.690
GILBERT GOTTFRIED: My
all-time favorite--

00:26:40.690 --> 00:26:42.190
DARA GOTTFRIED: I
know what this is.

00:26:42.190 --> 00:26:46.360
GILBERT GOTTFRIED: I wish I
could go back and record it.

00:26:46.360 --> 00:26:50.620
I was at a party years
ago, and OJ Simpson--

00:26:50.620 --> 00:26:51.356
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:51.356 --> 00:26:52.564
ALLAN WEINBERGER: Oh, my god!

00:26:52.564 --> 00:26:54.120
He killed.

00:26:54.120 --> 00:26:55.502
GILBERT GOTTFRIED: Yes.

00:26:55.502 --> 00:26:57.426
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:57.426 --> 00:26:59.970
[APPLAUSE]

00:26:59.970 --> 00:27:05.180
And he was a fan of mine, and
decided to do an imitation.

00:27:05.180 --> 00:27:08.860
And back then, you know--
football player, sometime

00:27:08.860 --> 00:27:10.120
actor.

00:27:10.120 --> 00:27:14.400
And now it would be like if
Charles Manson came up to me

00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:16.360
and said, hey!

00:27:16.360 --> 00:27:18.661
I'm-- you know the Tate murders?

00:27:18.661 --> 00:27:19.160
Here.

00:27:19.160 --> 00:27:19.660
Here.

00:27:19.660 --> 00:27:20.221
Look.

00:27:20.221 --> 00:27:21.634
Hi, I'm Gilbert.

00:27:21.634 --> 00:27:22.550
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:22.550 --> 00:27:23.050
Wow.

00:27:23.050 --> 00:27:25.120
That's very good.

00:27:25.120 --> 00:27:29.380
So if I could go back in
time, I would film that.

00:27:29.380 --> 00:27:32.226
I wouldn't kill Hitler,
though, but I'd film that.

00:27:32.226 --> 00:27:34.771
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:34.771 --> 00:27:37.270
NEIL BERKELEY: One time you
said to me that sometimes you've

00:27:37.270 --> 00:27:39.100
heard so many impressions,
that you think in your head

00:27:39.100 --> 00:27:41.470
that you're doing a bad
Gilbert Gottfried impression.

00:27:41.470 --> 00:27:42.700
GILBERT GOTTFRIED: Yeah.

00:27:42.700 --> 00:27:47.020
It does get like, sometimes
when I'm performing,

00:27:47.020 --> 00:27:49.810
I'll feel like, I'm
doing a really--

00:27:49.810 --> 00:27:53.175
like anybody in the street could
do a better Gilbert Gottfried

00:27:53.175 --> 00:27:54.750
right now than me.

00:27:54.750 --> 00:27:57.000
ALLAN WEINBERGER: Who does
the best Gilbert Gottfried?

00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:59.520
GILBERT GOTTFRIED: Oh,
there's been a few I've heard.

00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:00.828
Well, Jimmy Fallon.

00:28:00.828 --> 00:28:01.703
ALLAN WEINBERGER: OK.

00:28:01.703 --> 00:28:02.070
I could see him.

00:28:02.070 --> 00:28:03.320
DARA GOTTFRIED: Oh, excellent.

00:28:03.320 --> 00:28:06.797
GILBERT GOTTFRIED:
Funny imitation of me.

00:28:06.797 --> 00:28:09.380
NEIL BERKELEY: We're putting out
an extended cut of the movie.

00:28:09.380 --> 00:28:10.360
It's like 2 and 1/2 hours long.

00:28:10.360 --> 00:28:11.818
And there's this
moment in Toronto,

00:28:11.818 --> 00:28:14.590
which is in the cut, where
this guy is at a voiceover,

00:28:14.590 --> 00:28:15.820
and he starts doing it.

00:28:15.820 --> 00:28:18.344
And there's a really
awkward pause.

00:28:18.344 --> 00:28:20.260
And Gilbert is eating a
sandwich, and he goes,

00:28:20.260 --> 00:28:21.343
I can tell he's impressed.

00:28:21.343 --> 00:28:23.206
And Gilbert goes,
by the egg salad.

00:28:23.206 --> 00:28:23.940
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:23.940 --> 00:28:26.020
And this guy just like melts.

00:28:26.020 --> 00:28:27.375
And it crushed him.

00:28:27.375 --> 00:28:29.650
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:29.650 --> 00:28:32.770
ALLAN WEINBERGER: So this
documentary really hones

00:28:32.770 --> 00:28:33.430
in on--

00:28:33.430 --> 00:28:36.550
you're a family man now.

00:28:36.550 --> 00:28:40.180
And your sense of humor--

00:28:40.180 --> 00:28:42.580
I've never seen any comic
have such a wide range.

00:28:42.580 --> 00:28:44.680
You're in "Aladdin,"
and then you're

00:28:44.680 --> 00:28:47.710
known for the aristocrats joke.

00:28:47.710 --> 00:28:50.271
Do your children listen
to your stand-up?

00:28:50.271 --> 00:28:50.770
No.

00:28:50.770 --> 00:28:51.430
They're not allowed.

00:28:51.430 --> 00:28:52.000
DARA GOTTFRIED:
They're not allowed.

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:53.200
ALLAN WEINBERGER:
What's the ruling here?

00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:53.940
When are they allowed?

00:28:53.940 --> 00:28:55.280
DARA GOTTFRIED: They're not
allowed to see the movie,

00:28:55.280 --> 00:28:56.150
and they're not allowed to--

00:28:56.150 --> 00:28:57.830
GILBERT GOTTFRIED:
Until they're 57.

00:28:57.830 --> 00:28:58.742
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:58.742 --> 00:29:00.700
DARA GOTTFRIED: They've
come a couple of times.

00:29:00.700 --> 00:29:03.000
Like the first five minutes,
you've kept clean, right?

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:04.000
GILBERT GOTTFRIED: Yeah.

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:06.310
And even then,
I'll find something

00:29:06.310 --> 00:29:09.580
that seems a little obscene.

00:29:09.580 --> 00:29:10.800
And it's funny.

00:29:13.570 --> 00:29:17.990
My son, who's now
eight, he was asking

00:29:17.990 --> 00:29:21.700
Dara when he was about
six or something,

00:29:21.700 --> 00:29:24.010
can I go see Daddy's act?

00:29:24.010 --> 00:29:30.160
And she said, no, he
uses a lot of bad words.

00:29:30.160 --> 00:29:33.934
And he goes, that's
what makes it funny.

00:29:33.934 --> 00:29:34.900
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:34.900 --> 00:29:37.440
So he should be my
writer, basically.

00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:37.940
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:37.940 --> 00:29:40.440
ALLAN WEINBERGER: Do you think
they'll find it on their own,

00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:42.297
now that computers
are the way they are?

00:29:42.297 --> 00:29:43.630
GILBERT GOTTFRIED: Oh, I'm sure.

00:29:43.630 --> 00:29:48.224
You can't-- there's no such
a thing as a secret nowadays.

00:29:48.224 --> 00:29:49.890
DARA GOTTFRIED: But
are they interested?

00:29:49.890 --> 00:29:51.670
Like the other day,
they had no interest

00:29:51.670 --> 00:29:53.290
in coming with us to "Colbert."

00:29:56.050 --> 00:29:57.597
They're not that
interested in us.

00:29:57.597 --> 00:29:59.680
ALLAN WEINBERGER: Do they
know how famous you are?

00:30:02.469 --> 00:30:04.010
NEIL BERKELEY: Max
does an impression

00:30:04.010 --> 00:30:05.424
of people taking photos of you.

00:30:05.424 --> 00:30:06.340
GILBERT GOTTFRIED: Oh.

00:30:06.340 --> 00:30:07.330
That's amazing.

00:30:07.330 --> 00:30:09.850
Yeah.

00:30:09.850 --> 00:30:11.020
We'd have to show that.

00:30:11.020 --> 00:30:13.050
But it's such a good impression.

00:30:13.050 --> 00:30:14.390
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:14.390 --> 00:30:17.830
And he did it when
he was really small.

00:30:17.830 --> 00:30:22.240
And he came up to me in the
living room and goes, oh.

00:30:22.240 --> 00:30:23.320
Oh.

00:30:23.320 --> 00:30:25.000
I'm sorry.

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:27.670
You're Gilbert, right?

00:30:27.670 --> 00:30:30.298
I don't want to bother you.

00:30:30.298 --> 00:30:34.250
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:34.250 --> 00:30:36.410
Can we do a selfie?

00:30:36.410 --> 00:30:38.792
And he had everything.

00:30:38.792 --> 00:30:41.390
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:41.390 --> 00:30:44.030
ALLAN WEINBERGER: So let's talk
about the release of the film.

00:30:44.030 --> 00:30:44.970
NEIL BERKELEY: Yeah.

00:30:44.970 --> 00:30:46.220
ALLAN WEINBERGER: When this
is getting released tomorrow?

00:30:46.220 --> 00:30:46.719
What's next?

00:30:46.719 --> 00:30:48.200
NEIL BERKELEY: Tomorrow night.

00:30:48.200 --> 00:30:50.660
All of you should come
out to the IFC Center,

00:30:50.660 --> 00:30:52.530
or go on Twitter
and tell everyone.

00:30:52.530 --> 00:30:54.613
It's going to be at the
IFC Center tomorrow night,

00:30:54.613 --> 00:30:56.360
and all week long,
all next week.

00:30:56.360 --> 00:30:57.290
And then it's going to be in LA.

00:30:57.290 --> 00:30:58.664
And then very soon
after that, it

00:30:58.664 --> 00:31:00.170
will be on iTunes
and everything.

00:31:00.170 --> 00:31:02.045
But come out tomorrow
and see it in theaters.

00:31:02.045 --> 00:31:03.840
Because everyone says
this about movies.

00:31:03.840 --> 00:31:06.860
But Doug Benson, if
you're any fans of comedy,

00:31:06.860 --> 00:31:10.130
called this movie the
sweetest and filthiest movie

00:31:10.130 --> 00:31:11.680
he'd ever seen.

00:31:11.680 --> 00:31:13.160
And hearing those laughs.

00:31:13.160 --> 00:31:14.420
There are very tender moments.

00:31:14.420 --> 00:31:16.430
We get to meet
Gilbert's family--

00:31:16.430 --> 00:31:18.490
his sister Arlene Gottfried.

00:31:18.490 --> 00:31:20.990
I've been plugging you guys,
because when I tell this story,

00:31:20.990 --> 00:31:22.969
I say, everyone go
Google Arlene Gottfried.

00:31:22.969 --> 00:31:24.260
ALLAN WEINBERGER: Photographer!

00:31:24.260 --> 00:31:25.820
NEIL BERKELEY: Because she's
a brilliant photographer.

00:31:25.820 --> 00:31:27.450
She took some
pictures of New York--

00:31:27.450 --> 00:31:30.680
it's the bombed-out,
Lower East Side,

00:31:30.680 --> 00:31:32.630
scary New York that
doesn't exist anymore.

00:31:32.630 --> 00:31:34.970
So please go look her up.

00:31:34.970 --> 00:31:35.750
Oh, yeah.

00:31:35.750 --> 00:31:36.747
IFC Center tomorrow.

00:31:36.747 --> 00:31:38.330
Gilbert and I will
be there with Dara.

00:31:38.330 --> 00:31:41.096
Ira Glass is going to be
there hosting our Q&amp;A's.

00:31:41.096 --> 00:31:42.470
Artie Lange is
going to be there.

00:31:42.470 --> 00:31:44.330
So it should be a
really fun night.

00:31:44.330 --> 00:31:47.357
GILBERT GOTTFRIED: And you know
how reliable Artie Lange is.

00:31:47.357 --> 00:31:50.789
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:50.789 --> 00:31:52.580
ALLAN WEINBERGER: So
we're going to open up

00:31:52.580 --> 00:31:53.704
to questions in one moment.

00:31:53.704 --> 00:31:57.240
So if you do have a question,
go ahead and get ready.

00:31:57.240 --> 00:31:57.860
What's next?

00:31:57.860 --> 00:31:59.068
Oh, yeah, what did you want--

00:31:59.068 --> 00:32:00.830
NEIL BERKELEY: Gilbertmovie.com.

00:32:00.830 --> 00:32:03.171
When you're telling all
your friends to go see it.

00:32:03.171 --> 00:32:04.420
ALLAN WEINBERGER: What's next?

00:32:04.420 --> 00:32:05.836
What does the next
couple of years

00:32:05.836 --> 00:32:07.820
look like for you, Gilbert?

00:32:07.820 --> 00:32:10.340
GILBERT GOTTFRIED:
Arthritis, gout.

00:32:10.340 --> 00:32:14.060
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:14.060 --> 00:32:17.100
Looking at my own kids
going, who are you?

00:32:17.100 --> 00:32:17.600
What?

00:32:17.600 --> 00:32:18.680
Where am I now?

00:32:21.394 --> 00:32:22.560
ALLAN WEINBERGER: All right.

00:32:22.560 --> 00:32:23.370
Arthritis and gout.

00:32:23.370 --> 00:32:24.036
We'll end there.

00:32:24.036 --> 00:32:26.152
We'll open up to questions.

00:32:26.152 --> 00:32:31.399
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:31.399 --> 00:32:31.940
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:32:31.940 --> 00:32:34.705
First of all, I'd like to
say, thank you for coming.

00:32:34.705 --> 00:32:35.580
I just wanted to ask.

00:32:35.580 --> 00:32:37.250
So I've literally
grown up hearing

00:32:37.250 --> 00:32:39.954
your voice in "Aladdin,"
"Dr. Doolittle,"

00:32:39.954 --> 00:32:41.120
"Cyberchase" and everything.

00:32:41.120 --> 00:32:43.670
I was wondering what your
favorite animated work

00:32:43.670 --> 00:32:46.610
was to do?

00:32:46.610 --> 00:32:51.650
GILBERT GOTTFRIED: Well,
certainly the work on "Aladdin"

00:32:51.650 --> 00:32:56.990
is right up there, because it
was the most successful thing

00:32:56.990 --> 00:32:58.493
I've ever done.

00:32:58.493 --> 00:32:59.480
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:59.480 --> 00:33:04.820
And Disney hasn't fired
me over the years.

00:33:04.820 --> 00:33:07.580
But that, and then
smaller stuff.

00:33:07.580 --> 00:33:09.830
I remember I was
on "Ren and Stimpy"

00:33:09.830 --> 00:33:13.456
as Jerry, the belly button elf.

00:33:13.456 --> 00:33:15.230
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:15.230 --> 00:33:20.210
I think I was an ant in
an insecticide commercial.

00:33:20.210 --> 00:33:23.770
And a toaster in a Pop-tarts ad.

00:33:23.770 --> 00:33:26.270
ALLAN WEINBERGER: What was
this shoe gazey thing you did?

00:33:26.270 --> 00:33:27.186
GILBERT GOTTFRIED: Oh!

00:33:27.186 --> 00:33:28.240
Yes.

00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:31.020
This, I did one of
these commercials

00:33:31.020 --> 00:33:34.010
for one of those
products, those classic

00:33:34.010 --> 00:33:38.480
"As Seen on TV" products,
where they convince you

00:33:38.480 --> 00:33:40.920
you can't live without it.

00:33:40.920 --> 00:33:45.370
And this was a product
called Shoe Dini.

00:33:45.370 --> 00:33:46.780
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:46.780 --> 00:33:50.930
And they showed, at
the beginning of it,

00:33:50.930 --> 00:33:54.200
you'd see these old
people struggling

00:33:54.200 --> 00:33:56.840
to put their shoe on or off.

00:33:56.840 --> 00:33:59.150
And they'd be falling down.

00:33:59.150 --> 00:34:04.460
And as long as you didn't
ask the first question, which

00:34:04.460 --> 00:34:08.120
was, well, why didn't
they just sit in a chair

00:34:08.120 --> 00:34:11.600
when they're putting
their shoes on?

00:34:11.600 --> 00:34:15.730
But it was a shoehorn
with a stick.

00:34:15.730 --> 00:34:19.429
You basically-- a
retractable shoehorn,

00:34:19.429 --> 00:34:22.610
which-- how you lived
without it all these years.

00:34:22.610 --> 00:34:24.620
You'd press the button
and pull it out.

00:34:24.620 --> 00:34:28.179
So you'd put on
your shoe like that.

00:34:28.179 --> 00:34:30.447
DARA GOTTFRIED: Then how
do you tie your shoes?

00:34:30.447 --> 00:34:32.280
GILBERT GOTTFRIED: That
they didn't explain.

00:34:32.280 --> 00:34:33.780
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:33.780 --> 00:34:36.679
That-- I'm sure they're
selling another one

00:34:36.679 --> 00:34:39.787
with two robotic hands.

00:34:39.787 --> 00:34:40.620
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:34:44.139 --> 00:34:45.770
AUDIENCE: Hey, Gilbert.

00:34:45.770 --> 00:34:49.040
It seems like today, a comedian
has to constantly put out

00:34:49.040 --> 00:34:52.830
content to stay top of
mind-- whether it's Twitter,

00:34:52.830 --> 00:34:54.540
or YouTube, or what have you.

00:34:54.540 --> 00:34:57.410
And my impression of the way
it might have been 30 years ago

00:34:57.410 --> 00:34:59.270
or something is that
you could actually

00:34:59.270 --> 00:35:02.060
work on a piece of
material for six months,

00:35:02.060 --> 00:35:04.310
and then come out and
do a show or something,

00:35:04.310 --> 00:35:07.820
and it would kind
of last longer.

00:35:07.820 --> 00:35:08.960
Is that accurate?

00:35:08.960 --> 00:35:12.531
And how do you feel about
today versus back then?

00:35:12.531 --> 00:35:14.030
GILBERT GOTTFRIED:
Well, it's funny.

00:35:14.030 --> 00:35:18.970
When TV first came
about, the big fear

00:35:18.970 --> 00:35:23.380
was that all these old
Vaudevillian performers who

00:35:23.380 --> 00:35:28.150
had been doing the same
act for like 30 years

00:35:28.150 --> 00:35:31.270
would now be on TV, and
it would be eaten up.

00:35:31.270 --> 00:35:35.740
And TV is nothing
compared to the internet.

00:35:35.740 --> 00:35:39.010
And if you're working on
a bit, before you've even

00:35:39.010 --> 00:35:41.830
developed it, it'll
be all over the world.

00:35:41.830 --> 00:35:45.940
Because people are there
with these recording devices

00:35:45.940 --> 00:35:51.470
that could fit in a
ring on your hand.

00:35:51.470 --> 00:35:55.756
So it's that strange.

00:35:55.756 --> 00:35:56.675
AUDIENCE: Gotcha.

00:35:56.675 --> 00:35:57.175
Right.

00:35:57.175 --> 00:35:59.070
Thank you.

00:35:59.070 --> 00:36:02.136
GILBERT GOTTFRIED: That didn't
sound like a good answer.

00:36:02.136 --> 00:36:05.130
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:05.130 --> 00:36:05.879
OK.

00:36:05.879 --> 00:36:07.420
ALLAN WEINBERGER:
We're going to move

00:36:07.420 --> 00:36:08.560
to this side of the
room really quick.

00:36:08.560 --> 00:36:08.920
GILBERT GOTTFRIED: All right.

00:36:08.920 --> 00:36:09.788
I tried.

00:36:09.788 --> 00:36:11.355
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:11.355 --> 00:36:12.480
ALLAN WEINBERGER: Go ahead?

00:36:12.480 --> 00:36:13.210
AUDIENCE: Hey.

00:36:13.210 --> 00:36:15.040
Can you talk a little
bit about your voice,

00:36:15.040 --> 00:36:18.330
and how you found your voice
as a writer and a comic?

00:36:18.330 --> 00:36:22.510
GILBERT GOTTFRIED: That's
just through years of going up

00:36:22.510 --> 00:36:26.520
on stage every night.

00:36:26.520 --> 00:36:32.260
I never trusted these places
that say they teach comedy.

00:36:32.260 --> 00:36:36.520
It's like, you keep going on
stage over and over again.

00:36:36.520 --> 00:36:39.430
You bomb like crazy.

00:36:39.430 --> 00:36:42.640
And then eventually,
it comes about.

00:36:42.640 --> 00:36:44.440
Like when people
say, how did you

00:36:44.440 --> 00:36:47.140
develop your whole delivery?

00:36:47.140 --> 00:36:50.440
I never really consciously
thought, OK, I'm

00:36:50.440 --> 00:36:52.120
going to do it this way.

00:36:52.120 --> 00:36:55.780
To me it's like, if you
see someone walking down

00:36:55.780 --> 00:36:58.780
the street sipping
a cup of coffee,

00:36:58.780 --> 00:37:02.440
and you went over and said, you
know, the way you hold the cup

00:37:02.440 --> 00:37:03.070
and bring it--

00:37:03.070 --> 00:37:05.956
how did you first
come up with that?

00:37:05.956 --> 00:37:07.640
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:07.640 --> 00:37:09.640
ALLAN WEINBERGER: To add
to that question-- what

00:37:09.640 --> 00:37:13.660
do you recommend to comics and
aspiring comedians who are just

00:37:13.660 --> 00:37:15.300
starting out or
looking to get into it?

00:37:15.300 --> 00:37:16.300
GILBERT GOTTFRIED: Yeah.

00:37:16.300 --> 00:37:18.000
That's just basically it.

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:22.120
You find these clubs
that don't pay anything,

00:37:22.120 --> 00:37:26.140
and you just keep going
there with the hope

00:37:26.140 --> 00:37:28.540
first, that they'll
let you on stage.

00:37:28.540 --> 00:37:32.725
And then, if they do, just keep
trying as much as possible.

00:37:35.542 --> 00:37:37.000
AUDIENCE: Thank
you all for coming.

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:39.250
That was actually my question.

00:37:39.250 --> 00:37:40.614
So this question's--

00:37:40.614 --> 00:37:42.197
GILBERT GOTTFRIED:
So get out of here!

00:37:42.197 --> 00:37:42.905
AUDIENCE: I know.

00:37:42.905 --> 00:37:45.120
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:45.120 --> 00:37:47.560
Dara, how did Gilbert propose?

00:37:47.560 --> 00:37:49.080
DARA GOTTFRIED: Aw.

00:37:49.080 --> 00:37:51.240
That's really sweet.

00:37:51.240 --> 00:37:53.990
Well, we dated 10 years
before we got married.

00:37:53.990 --> 00:37:55.950
It was a long courtship.

00:37:55.950 --> 00:38:00.180
And finally, I just
said, let's get a ring.

00:38:00.180 --> 00:38:05.586
And he said, I saw an ad
somewhere in Hackensack.

00:38:05.586 --> 00:38:08.760
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:08.760 --> 00:38:10.240
Where they have
them really cheap.

00:38:10.240 --> 00:38:11.406
And I was like, don't worry.

00:38:11.406 --> 00:38:12.860
We don't spend too much.

00:38:12.860 --> 00:38:14.761
And then-- [LAUGHS]

00:38:14.761 --> 00:38:16.677
GILBERT GOTTFRIED: That
was the selling point.

00:38:16.677 --> 00:38:17.505
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:17.505 --> 00:38:19.255
DARA GOTTFRIED: And
then we were at a zoo.

00:38:19.255 --> 00:38:19.590
GILBERT GOTTFRIED: No.

00:38:19.590 --> 00:38:22.620
There's no love here, but we
won't have to spend any money.

00:38:22.620 --> 00:38:26.114
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:26.114 --> 00:38:27.780
DARA GOTTFRIED: Anyway,
we were at a zoo

00:38:27.780 --> 00:38:29.760
in Calgary, because
he loves dinosaurs,

00:38:29.760 --> 00:38:31.780
and they had a dinosaur exhibit.

00:38:31.780 --> 00:38:34.460
So it really wasn't
that romantic,

00:38:34.460 --> 00:38:36.120
to be honest with you.

00:38:36.120 --> 00:38:38.445
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:38.445 --> 00:38:39.195
OK, we're engaged.

00:38:39.195 --> 00:38:39.930
Here it is.

00:38:39.930 --> 00:38:43.717
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:43.717 --> 00:38:45.300
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I
was just wondering--

00:38:45.300 --> 00:38:46.680
for the filming of
the documentary,

00:38:46.680 --> 00:38:47.846
how did it impact your life?

00:38:51.210 --> 00:38:54.130
GILBERT GOTTFRIED: It
was one of those things,

00:38:54.130 --> 00:38:57.462
like I hated doing it.

00:38:57.462 --> 00:38:59.290
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:59.290 --> 00:39:02.155
And I hate watching
it, which Neil loves.

00:39:02.155 --> 00:39:03.780
DARA GOTTFRIED: But
you like the movie.

00:39:03.780 --> 00:39:04.779
GILBERT GOTTFRIED: Yeah.

00:39:04.779 --> 00:39:09.020
Well, when I watch
it, I'm like, oh god.

00:39:09.020 --> 00:39:14.160
Because I'm OK watching
myself as like Nick

00:39:14.160 --> 00:39:17.850
the plumber in a sitcom episode.

00:39:17.850 --> 00:39:20.960
But to watch me as me, I--

00:39:20.960 --> 00:39:24.750
it's kind of like how
people, when they first

00:39:24.750 --> 00:39:30.550
hear their voice recorded,
or see themselves on film,

00:39:30.550 --> 00:39:31.830
and they go, oh god.

00:39:31.830 --> 00:39:33.060
I don't look like that.

00:39:33.060 --> 00:39:35.070
And I don't sound like that.

00:39:35.070 --> 00:39:38.370
And there are scenes in the
movie where I look at myself

00:39:38.370 --> 00:39:42.510
and I go, do I really
walk like Fred Sanford

00:39:42.510 --> 00:39:43.847
in "Sanford and Son"?

00:39:46.650 --> 00:39:49.312
Like, you big dummy.

00:39:49.312 --> 00:39:51.160
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:51.160 --> 00:39:54.010
DARA GOTTFRIED: But like I
said, I shot it by myself.

00:39:54.010 --> 00:39:55.050
So it's really just--

00:39:55.050 --> 00:39:57.630
Gilbert and I, we went to 15
different cities, and Toronto,

00:39:57.630 --> 00:39:58.710
and Mexico.

00:39:58.710 --> 00:40:00.640
So it was really just
like tagging along,

00:40:00.640 --> 00:40:03.750
and I just happened to have
a camera every now and then.

00:40:03.750 --> 00:40:04.620
Yeah.

00:40:04.620 --> 00:40:06.899
The first time we traveled,
we went to Philadelphia.

00:40:06.899 --> 00:40:08.440
And I called Dara
and said, I'm going

00:40:08.440 --> 00:40:09.648
to go to Philly with Gilbert.

00:40:09.648 --> 00:40:12.539
And she goes, OK, you need
to go get a Megabus ticket.

00:40:12.539 --> 00:40:14.330
And I was like, what
are you talking about?

00:40:14.330 --> 00:40:15.450
And she goes, yeah,
he takes the Megabus.

00:40:15.450 --> 00:40:17.033
I don't know if you
know what that is.

00:40:17.033 --> 00:40:20.650
It's an $8 ticket to
anywhere you want to go.

00:40:20.650 --> 00:40:22.770
It's like Philly,
Baltimore, and DC.

00:40:22.770 --> 00:40:25.380
And she goes, oh, also,
don't tell Gilbert,

00:40:25.380 --> 00:40:27.840
but I spend three extra dollars
so I can get him a seat up

00:40:27.840 --> 00:40:30.170
front on the upper deck.

00:40:30.170 --> 00:40:30.835
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:30.835 --> 00:40:32.460
She goes, don't tell
him, because he'll

00:40:32.460 --> 00:40:34.140
tell me not to spend the money.

00:40:34.140 --> 00:40:34.980
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:34.980 --> 00:40:36.290
DARA GOTTFRIED: It's true.

00:40:36.290 --> 00:40:41.420
GILBERT GOTTFRIED: And Neil
is the most Gentile film

00:40:41.420 --> 00:40:43.690
maker you'll ever meet.

00:40:43.690 --> 00:40:45.390
It's like, he
would come up to me

00:40:45.390 --> 00:40:49.324
and say, what does fakakta mean?

00:40:49.324 --> 00:40:51.930
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:51.930 --> 00:40:56.100
And two days ago,
at my apartment,

00:40:56.100 --> 00:40:58.920
he was he was holding
something in his hand

00:40:58.920 --> 00:41:01.890
that he found on the table.

00:41:01.890 --> 00:41:06.150
And it was a little
plastic dreidel.

00:41:06.150 --> 00:41:08.640
And he was holding
it and looking at it

00:41:08.640 --> 00:41:14.040
like a caveman
looking at an iPhone.

00:41:14.040 --> 00:41:20.320
And with fear in his eyes,
he goes, what is this?

00:41:20.320 --> 00:41:24.080
And he goes, do
you play with it?

00:41:24.080 --> 00:41:25.380
And I said, yeah.

00:41:25.380 --> 00:41:27.240
I don't want to
talk to you anymore.

00:41:27.240 --> 00:41:31.787
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:31.787 --> 00:41:32.976
AUDIENCE: Thanks for coming.

00:41:32.976 --> 00:41:33.600
Quick question.

00:41:33.600 --> 00:41:36.990
We live in this weird
world right now,

00:41:36.990 --> 00:41:39.420
where you have overly
political correctness,

00:41:39.420 --> 00:41:42.330
and then our leader
says what he thinks.

00:41:42.330 --> 00:41:46.120
And you've made a career out of
saying the controversial thing,

00:41:46.120 --> 00:41:48.660
or potentially what's on your
mind, and in a great way.

00:41:48.660 --> 00:41:50.368
Just kind of curious
to get your thoughts

00:41:50.368 --> 00:41:53.810
on this weird world we're in
and political correctness.

00:41:53.810 --> 00:41:55.420
GILBERT GOTTFRIED: Yeah.

00:41:55.420 --> 00:42:02.980
Well, I'd like to think that
when Nixon was President--

00:42:02.980 --> 00:42:06.630
it was when the whole hippie
movement was going strong,

00:42:06.630 --> 00:42:09.480
and there were student
protests, and there

00:42:09.480 --> 00:42:13.550
was drugs, and orgies,
and everything.

00:42:13.550 --> 00:42:14.230
Skinny-dipping.

00:42:14.230 --> 00:42:15.520
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:15.520 --> 00:42:18.670
And it's like all these
different protests.

00:42:18.670 --> 00:42:26.760
And Nixon was saying that
there's a moral majority

00:42:26.760 --> 00:42:28.500
that he believes in.

00:42:28.500 --> 00:42:30.750
Like, these are
the troublemakers,

00:42:30.750 --> 00:42:33.210
but the majority is moral.

00:42:33.210 --> 00:42:39.550
And I like to think there's
a majority of people who have

00:42:39.550 --> 00:42:41.606
a fucking brain in their head.

00:42:41.606 --> 00:42:43.150
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:43.150 --> 00:42:44.800
When you see these
people who have

00:42:44.800 --> 00:42:48.820
to complain and get outraged.

00:42:48.820 --> 00:42:51.190
I still like to
think most people,

00:42:51.190 --> 00:42:54.030
they know what a joke is.

00:42:54.030 --> 00:42:59.830
And also I feel
like, say there's

00:42:59.830 --> 00:43:03.100
a big disaster, a tragedy.

00:43:03.100 --> 00:43:06.160
You can actually go
there and help out.

00:43:06.160 --> 00:43:09.070
Or you could write
out a generous check

00:43:09.070 --> 00:43:10.660
and send it to them.

00:43:10.660 --> 00:43:15.490
Or you could get offended
by a joke that someone made.

00:43:15.490 --> 00:43:19.792
And then sit back and
pat yourself on the back.

00:43:19.792 --> 00:43:21.776
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:21.776 --> 00:43:24.867
[APPLAUSE]

00:43:24.867 --> 00:43:26.700
ALLAN WEINBERGER: And
for our last question.

00:43:26.700 --> 00:43:28.080
AUDIENCE: Hey, there.

00:43:28.080 --> 00:43:31.504
I've been listening to
you for a long time.

00:43:31.504 --> 00:43:33.170
On "Howard Stern,"
they had you come on,

00:43:33.170 --> 00:43:34.610
and you're known impressions.

00:43:34.610 --> 00:43:38.540
They would have you
do double impressions.

00:43:38.540 --> 00:43:40.640
I was wondering if you
would give us, perhaps,

00:43:40.640 --> 00:43:45.770
a Jerry Seinfeld impersonating
perhaps our current president

00:43:45.770 --> 00:43:47.389
or a former US president.

00:43:47.389 --> 00:43:49.430
NEIL BERKELEY: Can I just
set this up real quick?

00:43:52.357 --> 00:43:54.440
There's a theory that I've
heard from other comics

00:43:54.440 --> 00:43:57.610
that Gilbert invented
the Seinfeld impression.

00:43:57.610 --> 00:44:00.050
And Richard Belzer told
me this story about

00:44:00.050 --> 00:44:02.420
how Gilbert would go
on in the early '80s,

00:44:02.420 --> 00:44:04.160
before Seinfeld was "Seinfeld."

00:44:04.160 --> 00:44:07.070
And he would do Seinfeld's
whole act as Seinfeld.

00:44:07.070 --> 00:44:08.306
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:08.306 --> 00:44:10.770
While Seinfeld was there.

00:44:10.770 --> 00:44:12.650
GILBERT GOTTFRIED:
And Seinfeld--

00:44:12.650 --> 00:44:16.820
the other comics and wait
staff would run into the room

00:44:16.820 --> 00:44:18.530
while I was doing this stuff.

00:44:18.530 --> 00:44:21.320
Seinfeld would stay
out in the bar,

00:44:21.320 --> 00:44:25.440
angrily pacing back and forth,
going [IMITATING SEINFELD] that

00:44:25.440 --> 00:44:28.082
doesn't sound anything like me.

00:44:28.082 --> 00:44:32.370
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:32.370 --> 00:44:37.320
But in answer to your
question, Seinfeld as Trump.

00:44:37.320 --> 00:44:42.630
That would be
[IMITATING] well, I

00:44:42.630 --> 00:44:46.276
say, with the Nazis
and the protesters,

00:44:46.276 --> 00:44:48.636
both sides were wrong.

00:44:48.636 --> 00:44:51.001
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:51.001 --> 00:44:55.260
[APPLAUSE]

00:44:55.260 --> 00:44:56.970
ALLAN WEINBERGER: All right.

00:44:56.970 --> 00:44:58.630
Thank you very much
for joining us.

00:44:58.630 --> 00:45:00.963
We're going to be here for a
few more minutes, if anyone

00:45:00.963 --> 00:45:02.620
wants to help Gilbert
steal some food.

00:45:02.620 --> 00:45:04.510
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:04.510 --> 00:45:07.500
GILBERT GOTTFRIED: Any of
you have a large knapsack?

00:45:07.500 --> 00:45:09.302
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:09.302 --> 00:45:11.260
ALLAN WEINBERGER: The
movie comes out tomorrow.

00:45:11.260 --> 00:45:12.519
Please go and watch it.

00:45:12.519 --> 00:45:13.560
Thank you guys very much.

00:45:13.560 --> 00:45:14.220
NEIL BERKELEY:
Thank you very much.

00:45:14.220 --> 00:45:15.386
ALLAN WEINBERGER: Thank you.

00:45:15.386 --> 00:45:16.320
That was a lot of fun.

00:45:16.320 --> 00:45:18.420
[APPLAUSE]

00:45:18.420 --> 00:45:19.970
DARA GOTTFRIED: Thank you.
