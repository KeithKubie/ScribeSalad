00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:12.269
 the staff is grumpy marin developed hulk 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.830
 of the android team 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.500
 I'm here today to talk a little 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:20.039
 about the new android 4.4 feature that 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.720
 I'm inpex and then what's good that epp 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.000
 epi index 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.680
 is when you have a specific theme 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.230
 return from a search you make 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:31.410
 through the android device and there 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:34.350
 allows links through the visualization 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.300
 of this content in your android app 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.850
 Good, let's go and admire showing 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.649
 Do you guys have a search for 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.649
 fire fire restaurant and you have one 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:45.450
 app that makes restaurant review 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.190
 reserve something like this 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.809
 put no one better than your own 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.329
 application to display your content 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.550
 It's not true so you do may have 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.449
 an action that calls a call to action 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.340
 button 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.980
 in this case a button such as peeling is 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.750
 that will directly lead your 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.180
 cooler app then for example 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:06.180
 We are seeing the search here. 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.100
 side and if the hypothetical the application where 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.570
 I am showing the information that in the case 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.750
 it is relevant you can make reservation 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.070
 restaurant is to invite your friends 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:15.720
 share and etc. 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.630
 How are you going to make it stay? 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.909
 good app available 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.040
 What I've been developing is your website. 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:25.500
 but you will have to write down then what are 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.659
 the links of the pages that can be 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.270
 open for your content displayed on the 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:32.130
 application android application light 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:35.100
 android that has some understand 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:37.650
 filters so that these links are not is 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.689
 open through the application universe 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:42.630
 that the system knows you can see 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:44.399
 here link within your application only 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.259
 show a little more detail 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:49.649
 then because of the oab marcia reveals the 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:52.200
 link elements is in the head section in 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:54.240
 section of your page or also the 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:57.570
 same link element but there along with the 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.590
 url element when mounting the mep site 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.079
 your site 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.549
 so the search knows that you have 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:05.310
 an action there that will be done by a 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:07.619
 Android application and look good is 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.360
 available he put the relation to and from 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:11.220
 android application you will have to 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.110
 do a sim have filters reminding about 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.600
 the intention 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.500
 That one has die linke filter on it. 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.600
 manifest 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.000
 so the system knows that 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.960
 type of link will open in your 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.360
 app 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:26.730
 good staff for more information and 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:29.040
 know how you do it example of 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:31.680
 implementation will take a look at this 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:34.770
 link also fell on google blog posts 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:36.270
 developers and also the master blog will 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:38.880
 to be able to see what the 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:42.390
 examples of usage procedures and there 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:44.520
 Enjoy this amazing resource 44.4 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:46.650
 You're going to bring even more urgency. 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:48.830
 possible the captive the sun will be very 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:51.660
 more is integrated with your application 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:54.540
 finally it's a new tape that you against 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:55.020
 android has to have that advantage there 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:58.940
 good 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:58.940
