I think general idea of whether living

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990
I think general idea of whether living
 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.130

citizens today are capable of imagining

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140
citizens today are capable of imagining
 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.880
citizens today are capable of imagining
the world when they're not there anymore

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:21.890
the world when they're not there anymore
 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:28.839
the world when they're not there anymore
that seems to be kind of the hardest

00:00:28.839 --> 00:00:28.849

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250
take the idea that there are many things
 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.479
take the idea that there are many things
that they could do which would be very

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489
that they could do which would be very
 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.580
that they could do which would be very

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590
helpful to people who are not yet here
 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.479
helpful to people who are not yet here
and I'm not sure whether civilizations

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489
and I'm not sure whether civilizations

and I'm not sure whether civilizations
ever been able to do that but there's

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500
ever been able to do that but there's
 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.430
ever been able to do that but there's
certainly a lot of impetus for that now

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440
certainly a lot of impetus for that now
 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.970
certainly a lot of impetus for that now
and so many issues come back to that

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:54.980
and so many issues come back to that
 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:59.840
and so many issues come back to that
what do you wish to give up perhaps or

change in order and often very small

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930
change in order and often very small
 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.210
change in order and often very small
increments which would make a tremendous

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220
increments which would make a tremendous
 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.310
increments which would make a tremendous
difference but it is true that the

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320
difference but it is true that the
 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.830
difference but it is true that the
counter force is an extraordinary urge

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:14.840
counter force is an extraordinary urge
 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.160
counter force is an extraordinary urge
deep within human beings apparently to

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170
deep within human beings apparently to
 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.460
deep within human beings apparently to
just look after themselves and fight

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470
just look after themselves and fight
 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:23.870
just look after themselves and fight
their way through and that's that sort

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880
their way through and that's that sort
 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.160
their way through and that's that sort

so I think this is of course where my

so I think this is of course where my
 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.440
so I think this is of course where my
profession seems to me to have

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450
profession seems to me to have
 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.590
profession seems to me to have
potentially some meaning which is that

some of their life might be less likely
to to just think only of their their own

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:52.790
to to just think only of their their own

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280
existence it's not guaranteed of course
 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.940
existence it's not guaranteed of course
because we don't know

00:01:59.940 --> 00:01:59.950
 
 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:05.940
 
we don't know whether people can change

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:05.950
 
 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:08.560
 
yeah I think the biggest challenge is

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:08.570
yeah I think the biggest challenge is
 

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:17.980
yeah I think the biggest challenge is
going to be trying to well the

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:17.990
going to be trying to well the
 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:23.260
going to be trying to well the
redistribution of resource there have

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:23.270
redistribution of resource there have
 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:24.910
redistribution of resource there have
been encouraging signs which is that

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920
been encouraging signs which is that
 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.790
been encouraging signs which is that
some of the richest people have decided

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:27.800
some of the richest people have decided
 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:31.990
some of the richest people have decided
that the length beyond an unheard-of

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000
that the length beyond an unheard-of
 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.070
that the length beyond an unheard-of
scale might be able to change some of

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:36.080
scale might be able to change some of
 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:40.090
scale might be able to change some of
the most horrible situations

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:40.100
the most horrible situations
 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:42.490
the most horrible situations
particularly African medical situation

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500
particularly African medical situation
 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:45.550
particularly African medical situation
so forth that's encouraging I think that

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560
so forth that's encouraging I think that
 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:50.100
so forth that's encouraging I think that
probably a much more radical idea of

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.110
probably a much more radical idea of
 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:52.570
probably a much more radical idea of
redistribution of resources is necessary

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:52.580
redistribution of resources is necessary
 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:56.080
redistribution of resources is necessary
and locally right now on a graph we're

and locally right now on a graph we're

the upper scale getting much richer and

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.170
the upper scale getting much richer and
 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:07.830
the upper scale getting much richer and
people on the bottom disappearing and

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.740
 
there of course one could argue that the

there of course one could argue that the
 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:15.340

fundamental psychological adjustment
 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:15.130
fundamental psychological adjustment
will have to take place and something

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:15.140
will have to take place and something
 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:17.020
will have to take place and something
like that which England experienced

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:17.030
like that which England experienced

would react probably just just in terms

would react probably just just in terms
of my own experiences day to day I think

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:37.940
of my own experiences day to day I think
 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:46.860
of my own experiences day to day I think
that the medical of bureaucracy and the

that the medical of bureaucracy and the
people with no access to medical care is

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:50.270
people with no access to medical care is
 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:53.370

probably as large a scandal as we have

probably as large a scandal as we have

some sort of ability to face that we've
 

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:09.040
some sort of ability to face that we've
made that we're in a terrible state

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:09.050
made that we're in a terrible state
 

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:10.780
made that we're in a terrible state
towards the rest of the world and we

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:10.790
towards the rest of the world and we

very very very little respect and

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:20.200
 
probably the idea that it's what I was

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:20.210
probably the idea that it's what I was

probably the idea that it's what I was
talking about before in another context

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:21.770
talking about before in another context
 

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:24.670

that this country has a terrible hard

time saying that they were wrong or made
 

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:29.980
time saying that they were wrong or made
a mistake and a few times we've been

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:29.990
a mistake and a few times we've been
 

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:31.920
a mistake and a few times we've been
able to do it it's been very beneficial

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:31.930
able to do it it's been very beneficial
 

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:37.590
able to do it it's been very beneficial
but it is going to have to happen it

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:37.600
but it is going to have to happen it
 

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:40.780
but it is going to have to happen it
it's amazing so soon after the

it's amazing so soon after the
 

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:44.020
it's amazing so soon after the
withdrawal from Vietnam that we seem to

be bent on trying to string out and draw
 

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:50.680
be bent on trying to string out and draw
out this very damaging process which

out this very damaging process which
 

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:54.460
out this very damaging process which
will will will damage it will hurt it
