[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:09.140
JESSE MICHELS: All
right, everybody.

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:11.890
Thank you so much for
coming to Talks at Google.

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:16.239
We have an amazing guest
for you today, Adam Braun.

00:00:16.239 --> 00:00:18.670
Adam started an
organization in 2008

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:21.040
called Pencils of Promise,
which a lot of you

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:22.420
might have heard of.

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:24.490
They've gone all
around the world

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:27.430
and started schools in
impoverished regions.

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:31.100
They've started over
400 schools to date.

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:32.950
He's actually the
New York Times best

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:36.110
selling author of "The
Promise of a Pencil,"

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:38.530
and he recently just
started his newest venture,

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:40.010
which is incredibly exciting.

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:44.170
It's trying to basically up-end
the traditional college system

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:47.740
and end the cycle of debt,
teach students practical skills.

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:48.920
It's a one-year program.

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:50.920
It's really exciting,
and he's here,

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:54.920
and that's mainly what we're
going to be focused on.

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:56.590
Can't wait to have Adam speak.

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:58.570
He's a perfect
example of somebody

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:01.720
who kind of embarked on a
nontraditional path that's

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:04.750
purpose driven at a young age.

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:07.120
And he's going to talk about
where education is headed

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:10.420
and what MissionU's
place is in that.

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:12.130
And that's what I
just described--

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:13.990
his new his new venture.

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:17.620
So please join me in welcoming
Adam Braun to the stage.

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:21.460
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:23.350
ADAM BRAUN: Thank you so much.

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:26.580
So as you heard, I spent
really the last decade

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.560
of my life focused on
education, both internationally

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:31.286
and now more so domestically.

00:01:31.286 --> 00:01:33.910
And so I figured I'd walk you a
little bit through that journey

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:38.276
and open up today's talk with
a little bit more context,

00:01:38.276 --> 00:01:39.900
in particular, on
MissionU, and then we

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.590
can dive into some questions and
then really open it up to a Q&amp;A

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:44.440
with all of you.

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:49.560
So to begin with, this is
a community in rural Ghana.

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.920
Pencils of Promise
began in 2008.

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.800
I put $25 into a bank account
in hopes of building one school,

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:59.490
and that first school
was in rural Laos.

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.800
Over time, what I
saw was that not only

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:06.810
did I have a personal passion
for attempting and really

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.340
guiding, I think, communities,
in particular communities

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.190
of poverty in rural parts
of the developing world,

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:16.590
to enable their future
generations of children

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.300
to gain access to
better education.

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.000
But that idea really resonated
with a lot of people,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.800
in particular, young
people across the country.

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.410
And so what started
in rural Laos

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:28.500
grew to Nicaragua and
Guatemala, eventually Ghana.

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.070
And this was a community that I
entered with some of our staff.

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:34.590
And what we saw was
that about 800 people

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.270
live in this community.

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:39.210
And this was considered the
school for the entire village.

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:41.600
So you can imagine, obviously,
these children were not

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:43.350
getting access to the
quality of education

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:45.000
that we would all want for them.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.540
And with the support of actually
a school in the United States--

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:49.950
in Chicago--

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.470
that put together a
peer-to-peer fundraiser,

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.990
we were able to raise
the funds to go and work

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:57.120
with this community
directly to really transform

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.040
the lives of those children.

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.435
And it transformed
from this into this,

00:03:01.435 --> 00:03:03.310
which is what a completed
a Pencil of Promise

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:04.420
school looks like.

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:07.394
And I spent a lot of time over
this last decade going, really,

00:03:07.394 --> 00:03:09.810
not only around the country,
but around the world speaking

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:13.080
about this work, trying to
really galvanize others to get

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:14.495
involved in this process.

00:03:14.495 --> 00:03:15.870
And fortunately,
the organization

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:17.120
has grown by leaps and bounds.

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:20.010
It's really found
tremendous success.

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.980
And the next step
for me in 2013 is

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:25.660
we started to approach what
felt like a very big milestone,

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:28.020
which was completing our
100th school, which actually

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:29.662
was in Ghana as well.

00:03:29.662 --> 00:03:31.120
I decided to write
a book about it.

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:33.480
And that book was called
"The Promise of a Pencil."

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.063
What was really
important was actually

00:03:35.063 --> 00:03:37.710
the subtitle of the book, which
is "how an ordinary person can

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:38.918
create extraordinary change."

00:03:38.918 --> 00:03:43.560
And so as much as I felt
really inspired by the work

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.957
that we were taking
on, my real goal

00:03:45.957 --> 00:03:47.790
was actually to help
other people figure out

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:49.623
how they could pursue
their sense of purpose

00:03:49.623 --> 00:03:50.940
and their sense of passion.

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:53.440
And so the book is framed
around 30 very short chapters.

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:55.320
Each chapter is
titled with a mantra,

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:57.870
and those mantras were
really the guideposts for me

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:01.560
as I navigated the challenging
waters of figuring out

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:04.410
how do you build a global
organization from scratch,

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:07.060
in particular, starting
in late 2008 in New York,

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:09.540
which was an incredibly
challenging period.

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:12.120
And so that subtitle, "how
an ordinary person can

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.910
create extraordinary change,"
is what motivated me.

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:18.360
And I found myself on
many, many college campuses

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:20.570
around the country.

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:23.010
And as I would tell
this story, there

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:25.590
were certainly a subset of
people that would actively

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:26.550
get involved.

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:29.190
And they'd tell their friends,
they'd tell their family,

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:30.960
and as a result,
this organization

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:33.210
continued to grow
in recent years.

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:37.102
And as of today, we've
now built over 400 schools

00:04:37.102 --> 00:04:37.810
around the world.

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:40.380
We have about 75,000
students in our programs.

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:43.020
And what started
with just $25 has now

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:44.730
turned into more
than $50 million

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:48.130
raised to support these
children around the world.

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:51.420
But as I went from
location to location

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:55.170
to location really speaking
about the value and virtue

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:58.746
of this work, what I found was
a common refrain on every type

00:04:58.746 --> 00:05:00.120
of college campus
that I visited,

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:03.990
whether these were elite private
schools, community colleges

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:06.900
in Tennessee and Arizona,
large state schools,

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:09.042
non-elite private
schools, there was always

00:05:09.042 --> 00:05:10.500
this significant
subset of students

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:12.420
that would come up to
me afterwards or ask

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:13.410
a question during Q&amp;A.

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:15.430
And they'd say, Adam,
this is really great

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:17.096
what you're describing,
but I can't even

00:05:17.096 --> 00:05:18.900
consider the type
of work that you're

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:21.990
describing because, one, I
have so much student debt

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:23.490
that the number-one
thing in my life

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:25.650
is trying to get out
of that student debt.

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:27.840
And then, two, I
don't actually have

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:30.120
any of the skills that
are going to help me

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:31.500
get the jobs that I'm seeking.

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:34.990
And I'm now hearing this as I
apply for internships and jobs.

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:37.440
And so I started to
do a lot of research

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:38.760
into some of these challenges.

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:40.636
And I deeply believe in
organizational focus.

00:05:40.636 --> 00:05:42.301
And so Pencils of
Promise needed to stay

00:05:42.301 --> 00:05:44.310
true to its core mission
to support children

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:45.610
in the developing world.

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:47.700
But there was a huge
personal transition for me

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:49.470
when I met my wife.

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:53.472
And at the time, you start to
fall in love with somebody,

00:05:53.472 --> 00:05:54.930
you start planning
a life together,

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:57.120
and one of those
important conversations

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:59.940
is to figure out where you're
coming from financially.

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:03.630
And what was very clear to me
from really the first month

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:06.060
that we spent
together was that she

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:08.526
was from a very
loving family but one

00:06:08.526 --> 00:06:09.900
without a lot of
financial means.

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:11.316
And they came to
this country when

00:06:11.316 --> 00:06:13.770
she was nine from South Africa,
moved to the Boston area

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:17.790
in hopes of really building a
life of success and prosperity.

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:21.400
And if you're new to this
country, in particular

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:24.910
or you're of the working-class
or lower-income family, what's

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:27.340
the number-one thing that
every parent tells you

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:29.402
you should invest and
that you should focus on

00:06:29.402 --> 00:06:31.560
to get a better life ahead?

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:32.880
Education, right?

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:35.400
And I think that's a dream
that we've really kind of sold

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:37.555
to generation after generation.

00:06:37.555 --> 00:06:39.600
On my mother's side,
my grandfather actually

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:42.540
was part of the first wave
of individuals to get access

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:44.040
to free college in
the United States

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:46.800
through the GI Bill,
which was passed in 1944.

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:49.350
And it really started this
movement towards college

00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:50.580
for all.

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:53.190
But my wife bought into
that, and she went to college

00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:55.650
initially out of state, after
two years transferred back

00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:57.540
in state to try and
reduce the cost.

00:06:57.540 --> 00:06:59.456
And after three years
needed to leave school

00:06:59.456 --> 00:07:01.830
before actually attaining that
bachelor's degree that she

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:04.500
was pursuing, because
the challenges were

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:06.030
so great financially.

00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:09.120
And by the time that I
met her, her student debt

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:13.860
was at over $100,000 as a
result of these three years.

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:15.555
And it was absolutely crushing.

00:07:15.555 --> 00:07:17.430
And eventually, as we
moved towards marriage,

00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:19.660
I said you should
really consider

00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:21.570
declaring full bankruptcy.

00:07:21.570 --> 00:07:22.742
You should hopefully--

00:07:22.742 --> 00:07:24.450
I know it's going to
destroy your credit,

00:07:24.450 --> 00:07:25.408
but I have good credit.

00:07:25.408 --> 00:07:27.110
We'll be OK as a couple.

00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:29.086
And at least you'll be
out of this cage that

00:07:29.086 --> 00:07:30.960
might keep you in poverty
throughout the rest

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:32.200
of your life.

00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:35.619
And she said to me, Adam, that
sounds great but student debt

00:07:35.619 --> 00:07:38.160
is the only debt in the United
States that you cannot declare

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:39.175
bankruptcy on.

00:07:39.175 --> 00:07:41.550
And I remember-- you know, I
have a financial background,

00:07:41.550 --> 00:07:43.980
started my career at Bain,
been working at hedge funds

00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:44.950
since I was like 16.

00:07:44.950 --> 00:07:46.830
I was like, that's not possible.

00:07:46.830 --> 00:07:48.320
That's just impossible.

00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:49.860
Let me talk to some
financial people

00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:51.940
and help you get out of this.

00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:54.750
And of course, she
was absolutely right,

00:07:54.750 --> 00:07:56.410
and I was absolutely wrong.

00:07:56.410 --> 00:07:59.940
And as soon as I really
discovered that, I think that

00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:02.790
in, at least my mind, that's the
moment that MissionU was born,

00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:04.560
that if we had a
societal injustice that

00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:07.950
was this great, this profound,
and the one thing that

00:08:07.950 --> 00:08:11.340
was supposed to enable the
people who needed to kind

00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:13.860
of experience
social mobility most

00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:16.680
was going to keep them
in those places or worse,

00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:19.440
then we're creating a greater
and greater societal divide

00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:21.987
between the classes,
which obviously leads us

00:08:21.987 --> 00:08:24.570
to this huge political division
and all these other challenges

00:08:24.570 --> 00:08:26.440
that we're now
facing as a country.

00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:29.010
And so I said I need
to research this more.

00:08:29.010 --> 00:08:33.450
And I'll show you a chart
that a friend of mine,

00:08:33.450 --> 00:08:35.730
Neil Blumenthal, sent
me a few months ago.

00:08:35.730 --> 00:08:37.407
Neil is the
co-founder and co-CEO

00:08:37.407 --> 00:08:39.990
of Warby Parker and someone who
is also passionate about this,

00:08:39.990 --> 00:08:41.909
because he's seeing
it on his team.

00:08:41.909 --> 00:08:45.090
Some of the challenges of
finding work-ready talent,

00:08:45.090 --> 00:08:46.410
especially out of undergrad.

00:08:46.410 --> 00:08:50.060
And so this is the price
change in consumer goods

00:08:50.060 --> 00:08:52.350
over the last 20 years or so.

00:08:52.350 --> 00:08:55.350
And what you can see is that the
bottom, things like software,

00:08:55.350 --> 00:08:57.900
toys, new cars, clothing,
et cetera, essentially

00:08:57.900 --> 00:09:00.630
luxury consumer goods, have
actually drastically come down.

00:09:00.630 --> 00:09:02.947
Much more people can access
them than ever before.

00:09:02.947 --> 00:09:05.280
What you see at the very top
is that education has never

00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:06.510
been more expensive.

00:09:06.510 --> 00:09:09.330
And even more expensive
than traditional education

00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:10.860
is college tuition.

00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:14.010
It's risen more than essentially
any other incurred fee

00:09:14.010 --> 00:09:16.249
that someone is going to
take on in their life.

00:09:16.249 --> 00:09:18.540
As I started to dig further
and further into this, what

00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:20.820
I realized was that
not only do you

00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:22.860
see this huge
growth, the red line

00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:25.650
in the cost of getting
an undergraduate degree,

00:09:25.650 --> 00:09:27.900
but the blue line is
the average earnings

00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:30.930
of a bachelor-degree holder
between the ages of 24 and 34.

00:09:30.930 --> 00:09:32.640
And so that's
actually gone down.

00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:35.730
And so what we have
is, one, this situation

00:09:35.730 --> 00:09:38.640
where any person who's
entering college and has

00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:41.350
to take on debt, that number is
just increasing and increasing.

00:09:41.350 --> 00:09:43.654
And now it's becoming
oftentimes insurmountable.

00:09:43.654 --> 00:09:45.570
Today's entering freshmen
will have on average

00:09:45.570 --> 00:09:50.880
$50,000 of debt by the time
they graduate, if they graduate.

00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:54.300
And only a much lower
percentage than we

00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:56.927
actually anticipate graduate.

00:09:56.927 --> 00:09:59.010
And then, two, they actually
don't have the skills

00:09:59.010 --> 00:09:59.610
that they need.

00:09:59.610 --> 00:10:01.110
About 3/4 believe
that their college

00:10:01.110 --> 00:10:04.080
has failed to prepare
them for the real world.

00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:06.840
And so there are
three macro shifts

00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:09.840
that I observed in
really 2016 into 2017,

00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:11.760
and now here we
are in 2018, that

00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:13.740
would enable a very
new model for us

00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:17.730
to really kind of recreate,
reinvent, and reinvigorate

00:10:17.730 --> 00:10:21.000
this very oftentimes
averse-to-change space

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:22.170
of higher ed.

00:10:22.170 --> 00:10:25.170
And so the first is
historically credentials

00:10:25.170 --> 00:10:27.270
were really the
metric for success.

00:10:27.270 --> 00:10:29.160
People just said, OK,
do you have a degree?

00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:30.997
Yes, then you must be
skilled, because we

00:10:30.997 --> 00:10:33.330
didn't have all this other
information on an individual.

00:10:33.330 --> 00:10:34.954
You couldn't search
for them on Google.

00:10:34.954 --> 00:10:37.080
You couldn't look up
their LinkedIn credentials

00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:38.490
10 or 15 years ago.

00:10:38.490 --> 00:10:42.900
So now seeing this shift over
to competency-based hiring,

00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:44.370
in particular for
technical skills

00:10:44.370 --> 00:10:46.040
you can just put a test
in front of somebody

00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:48.000
and you can assess their
technical abilities.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.580
And that's actually much
more important than perhaps

00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:52.330
whether they have
a degree or not.

00:10:52.330 --> 00:10:54.630
The second is that
historically tests were

00:10:54.630 --> 00:10:56.730
the primary method of learning.

00:10:56.730 --> 00:10:58.920
We did rote
memorization and then

00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:00.390
after that rote
memorization, then

00:11:00.390 --> 00:11:03.810
we just jumped into an exam,
and we regurgitated that,

00:11:03.810 --> 00:11:05.530
and that was a
demonstration of learning.

00:11:05.530 --> 00:11:07.890
And I think that what we are
seeing a radical shift to

00:11:07.890 --> 00:11:12.270
is project-based learning,
where it's much more replicable

00:11:12.270 --> 00:11:14.880
to put together a
group of projects

00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:17.430
that a person actually
navigates through in a group.

00:11:17.430 --> 00:11:20.250
And that in itself is a
lot more demonstrative

00:11:20.250 --> 00:11:22.597
of what we actually
experience in the real world,

00:11:22.597 --> 00:11:23.430
in our work context.

00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:26.160
And then the third is that in
2012, we saw the rise of MOOCs

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:27.574
like Coursera and Udacity.

00:11:27.574 --> 00:11:29.115
There was this huge
belief that we're

00:11:29.115 --> 00:11:30.390
going to have the best
professor in the world.

00:11:30.390 --> 00:11:32.230
He's going to get 15,000
people, and that's

00:11:32.230 --> 00:11:34.630
going to solve the
challenges of education.

00:11:34.630 --> 00:11:37.660
And what we're seeing is that
the vast majority of people

00:11:37.660 --> 00:11:39.270
don't actually
complete those courses.

00:11:39.270 --> 00:11:40.880
It's less than 5%.

00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:43.250
Most of us are not
considered autodidacts,

00:11:43.250 --> 00:11:46.150
that we can teach ourselves
and have that motivation

00:11:46.150 --> 00:11:48.670
and accountability to
complete one of those courses.

00:11:48.670 --> 00:11:52.190
And so what we are
able to do, though,

00:11:52.190 --> 00:11:56.050
is work very effectively in
online cohorts when it's live,

00:11:56.050 --> 00:11:57.700
synchronous instruction.

00:11:57.700 --> 00:12:00.570
When there is an instructor,
a world-class expert

00:12:00.570 --> 00:12:02.320
in something, with a
small group and we're

00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:05.177
held accountable to those
around us on the screen,

00:12:05.177 --> 00:12:07.510
and it's done live, that's
actually very, very powerful.

00:12:07.510 --> 00:12:10.480
And we've seen a few models
involved in that space that

00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:13.750
are able to demonstrate that.

00:12:13.750 --> 00:12:15.770
And really, this started 2016.

00:12:15.770 --> 00:12:18.490
I moved from New York, after
replacing myself as CEO

00:12:18.490 --> 00:12:21.190
at Pencils of Promise,
out to the Bay Area

00:12:21.190 --> 00:12:23.290
to focus on building
a college alternative

00:12:23.290 --> 00:12:26.260
for the 21st century, really
reinventing the model of what

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:28.060
higher education
can and should look

00:12:28.060 --> 00:12:30.290
like if you started from today.

00:12:30.290 --> 00:12:31.930
And so I'll show
you a quick video.

00:12:31.930 --> 00:12:33.970
It features some really
extraordinary people

00:12:33.970 --> 00:12:35.678
that have gotten behind
what we're doing,

00:12:35.678 --> 00:12:38.500
and it walks you a little
bit through why this works

00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:40.486
and how it works.

00:12:40.486 --> 00:12:41.890
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:14:45.900 --> 00:14:46.830
[PLAYBACK ENDED]

00:14:46.830 --> 00:14:49.490
ADAM BRAUN: So
MissionU, in essence,

00:14:49.490 --> 00:14:52.422
is this one-year program that
focuses on real-world skills.

00:14:52.422 --> 00:14:54.380
And one of the things
that we've certainly seen

00:14:54.380 --> 00:14:56.660
is that it's not enough just
to teach hard technical skills,

00:14:56.660 --> 00:14:58.310
but people that
really thrive actually

00:14:58.310 --> 00:15:00.770
possess this whole
wealth of soft skills--

00:15:00.770 --> 00:15:04.130
effective collaboration,
critical thinking abilities,

00:15:04.130 --> 00:15:06.500
effective communication,
both in written,

00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:10.200
whether it's email or building
presentations or in person.

00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:12.260
And so we also
thought about, what

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:17.720
is an actual viable revenue
model for a modern institution

00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:20.930
that aligns itself with the
outcomes and the aspirations

00:15:20.930 --> 00:15:22.610
of their students from day one?

00:15:22.610 --> 00:15:27.590
And so what we decided was that
before any student ever paid us

00:15:27.590 --> 00:15:29.470
a dollar of tuition,
we would have

00:15:29.470 --> 00:15:31.970
to demonstrate to them that
they had achieved success, which

00:15:31.970 --> 00:15:33.590
is really the exact
opposite of what

00:15:33.590 --> 00:15:35.180
happens on a traditional
college today, right?

00:15:35.180 --> 00:15:36.870
You take out these big
loans, you pay the school,

00:15:36.870 --> 00:15:39.350
and then you kind of hope
for the best, that you end up

00:15:39.350 --> 00:15:40.710
with a job afterwards.

00:15:40.710 --> 00:15:42.260
But their commitment
essentially ends

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:43.926
when you walk out
their door, and that's

00:15:43.926 --> 00:15:47.210
when they usually reach out in
order to ask for a donation.

00:15:47.210 --> 00:15:49.100
How many people have
gotten that solicitation

00:15:49.100 --> 00:15:50.016
from their alma mater?

00:15:50.016 --> 00:15:51.630
Probably all of us.

00:15:51.630 --> 00:15:54.950
And so what we decided was that
when someone got in MissionU,

00:15:54.950 --> 00:15:57.200
we would charge them
absolutely no tuition upfront.

00:15:57.200 --> 00:15:58.700
And instead, we
would invest in them

00:15:58.700 --> 00:16:01.340
throughout the course of
their entire year at MissionU.

00:16:01.340 --> 00:16:04.310
And at the end of that
year, only if and when

00:16:04.310 --> 00:16:06.740
they were making at
least $50,000 or more,

00:16:06.740 --> 00:16:09.020
they would contribute
back 15% of their income

00:16:09.020 --> 00:16:09.920
for three years.

00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:12.130
And then that would be the
end of their obligation.

00:16:12.130 --> 00:16:15.350
And so it's an entirely
outcomes-based model.

00:16:15.350 --> 00:16:18.320
And we said, so when it comes
to designing curriculum,

00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:21.440
most colleges kind
of oftentimes are

00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:23.810
very separated from
the business world.

00:16:23.810 --> 00:16:25.540
We said we should
absolutely partner

00:16:25.540 --> 00:16:26.540
with the business world.

00:16:26.540 --> 00:16:27.664
This is what students want.

00:16:27.664 --> 00:16:29.900
91% of today's freshmen say
they're going to college

00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:30.967
to get a better job.

00:16:30.967 --> 00:16:33.050
And so before we ever
started recruiting students,

00:16:33.050 --> 00:16:35.570
we were speaking to
world-class companies.

00:16:35.570 --> 00:16:37.880
And they deeply advised
us on curriculum.

00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:39.650
Everything that we
teach our students

00:16:39.650 --> 00:16:41.810
goes through the lens
of employer partners

00:16:41.810 --> 00:16:43.899
evaluating, assessing,
and advising.

00:16:43.899 --> 00:16:45.440
The second is we
would create content

00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:47.994
so we have guest speakers
nonstop for our students.

00:16:47.994 --> 00:16:49.910
They oftentimes go on
site to actual companies

00:16:49.910 --> 00:16:51.630
to get that
real-world experience.

00:16:51.630 --> 00:16:54.410
So all of our employer
partners get first cut

00:16:54.410 --> 00:16:56.240
at this incredible
pipeline of talent.

00:16:56.240 --> 00:17:00.050
And as of now, these
partners include companies

00:17:00.050 --> 00:17:02.990
like Spotify, Lyft, Uber,
Warby Parker, Casper,

00:17:02.990 --> 00:17:05.000
Harry's, et cetera,
with a bunch more

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.700
to be announced shortly, and
hopefully Google at some point

00:17:07.700 --> 00:17:08.910
as well.

00:17:08.910 --> 00:17:11.119
And so what I figured
would actually be helpful

00:17:11.119 --> 00:17:12.769
is to walk you
through a little bit

00:17:12.769 --> 00:17:14.810
of how we've integrated
Google's technology being

00:17:14.810 --> 00:17:16.700
here on campus.

00:17:16.700 --> 00:17:20.000
You guys have been an
incredible, incredible provider

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.490
of the technology that actually
powers a lot of our student

00:17:22.490 --> 00:17:23.530
experience.

00:17:23.530 --> 00:17:24.530
We use blended learning.

00:17:24.530 --> 00:17:26.738
We think that's really the
future of education, which

00:17:26.738 --> 00:17:28.400
is a hybrid of
both online, which

00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:31.250
is live primarily for our
students, as well as in person.

00:17:31.250 --> 00:17:34.430
We think that a lot of students
can learn very well online,

00:17:34.430 --> 00:17:36.950
in particular technical
skills, but those soft skills

00:17:36.950 --> 00:17:39.770
and those relationships that you
create with your cohort mates

00:17:39.770 --> 00:17:42.164
really have to be
facilitated in person.

00:17:42.164 --> 00:17:44.580
So our students come together
at minimum every other week.

00:17:44.580 --> 00:17:46.121
A lot of them actually
live together,

00:17:46.121 --> 00:17:49.730
because you have to live within
50 miles of your cohort city.

00:17:49.730 --> 00:17:52.062
And then finally,
I figured I'd just

00:17:52.062 --> 00:17:54.020
share a little bit of
what our year looks like.

00:17:54.020 --> 00:17:55.520
The first trimester
is a deep dive

00:17:55.520 --> 00:17:57.410
into what we consider
foundational skills,

00:17:57.410 --> 00:17:59.572
a mix of both hard
skills and soft skills,

00:17:59.572 --> 00:18:02.030
a lot of things that come out
of Stanford on the soft skill

00:18:02.030 --> 00:18:04.610
and holistic development side,
a lot of things that come out

00:18:04.610 --> 00:18:07.250
of places like Bain where I
started my career, as well

00:18:07.250 --> 00:18:09.590
as some of the
instruction from top data

00:18:09.590 --> 00:18:12.350
scientists and our
instructors, as well as

00:18:12.350 --> 00:18:16.040
advisors come from places like
Harvard and Stanford and MIT.

00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:18.071
Second trimester is a
deep dive into your major.

00:18:18.071 --> 00:18:20.570
Right now we offer one, which
is data analytics and business

00:18:20.570 --> 00:18:21.530
intelligence.

00:18:21.530 --> 00:18:23.204
Over time, we'll
layer in many more.

00:18:23.204 --> 00:18:24.870
And then the final
trimester is actually

00:18:24.870 --> 00:18:27.110
real-world work experience,
either internships,

00:18:27.110 --> 00:18:29.280
fellowships, or
consulting projects,

00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:31.880
so that they can complete the
year with the actual competency

00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:35.390
that they want to enter
the workforce with.

00:18:35.390 --> 00:18:37.160
So with that, I guess
we'll kind of dive

00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:38.880
into a little bit
of a conversation.

00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:42.375
But if anybody wants to
follow up or get involved

00:18:42.375 --> 00:18:44.000
in any capacity, this
is just my email,

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:45.807
and I'll leave it
up there as we chat.

00:18:45.807 --> 00:18:46.640
JESSE MICHELS: Cool.

00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:47.440
Thanks, Adam.

00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:48.148
ADAM BRAUN: Yeah.

00:18:48.148 --> 00:18:49.068
Thank you.

00:18:49.068 --> 00:18:52.092
[APPLAUSE]

00:18:52.092 --> 00:18:53.050
JESSE MICHELS: Awesome.

00:18:53.050 --> 00:18:57.760
Really appreciate you being
here and for the Google plug.

00:18:57.760 --> 00:19:00.960
So I want to kind of just
bring it back for a second

00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:04.570
and just provide a little bit
of context for the audience.

00:19:04.570 --> 00:19:05.752
Talk about your childhood.

00:19:05.752 --> 00:19:07.960
You talked about the inflection
point between Pencils

00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:10.650
of Promise and MissionU.

00:19:10.650 --> 00:19:12.700
I'd love to hear you
focus on the inflection

00:19:12.700 --> 00:19:16.420
point between the
kind of overachieving

00:19:16.420 --> 00:19:21.130
typical path of hedge fund,
Bain, to Pencils of Promise.

00:19:21.130 --> 00:19:22.720
ADAM BRAUN: Sure.

00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:25.070
I had a good childhood,
I mean, a great one.

00:19:25.070 --> 00:19:26.830
My parents are amazing.

00:19:26.830 --> 00:19:29.680
So now I have 14-month-old
twins at home.

00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:33.185
And so my parents have
suddenly never become smarter

00:19:33.185 --> 00:19:34.810
in my life, and I've
never gone to them

00:19:34.810 --> 00:19:37.000
for more advice than since
becoming a parent myself.

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:39.800
But they're both very loving.

00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:42.130
My dad's an immigrant,
came here when he was

00:19:42.130 --> 00:19:45.250
three, a child of two
Holocaust survivors.

00:19:45.250 --> 00:19:47.410
And my mother's
father passed away

00:19:47.410 --> 00:19:49.630
when she was quite
young, when she was 11.

00:19:49.630 --> 00:19:52.484
And so I think that even though
we had this great upbringing--

00:19:52.484 --> 00:19:54.400
my dad's a dentist, my
mom's an orthodontist--

00:19:54.400 --> 00:20:00.190
and so I don't think that
we felt any sense of, hey,

00:20:00.190 --> 00:20:02.440
we're impoverished.

00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:04.420
But I'd look around in
the town that we grew up

00:20:04.420 --> 00:20:05.950
in, which is
Greenwich, Connecticut,

00:20:05.950 --> 00:20:08.680
and there were certainly people
with way more than what we had.

00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:12.010
And so I was always aware
of that juxtaposition

00:20:12.010 --> 00:20:15.790
that we were fine, but there
was a lot more to be achieved.

00:20:15.790 --> 00:20:19.780
But I think having
the recognition

00:20:19.780 --> 00:20:22.010
that your grandparents
lost everything,

00:20:22.010 --> 00:20:24.730
including family members
and every possession

00:20:24.730 --> 00:20:28.130
in the Holocaust, there
was this kind of mentality,

00:20:28.130 --> 00:20:31.030
I guess, just ingrained
in us, this kind

00:20:31.030 --> 00:20:33.317
of like immigrant
mentality of you've

00:20:33.317 --> 00:20:34.900
got to work for
everything that you're

00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:36.220
going to go out and achieve.

00:20:36.220 --> 00:20:39.242
And so in the
teenage mind, it was

00:20:39.242 --> 00:20:41.200
go out and make a lot of
money and hedge funds,

00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:44.264
and the world of finance was
the best way to accomplish that.

00:20:44.264 --> 00:20:45.680
And so that was
the path I was on.

00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:48.370
But when I was 21, I
went on Semester at Sea

00:20:48.370 --> 00:20:50.982
and just had this series of
life-changing experiences

00:20:50.982 --> 00:20:52.690
through exposure to
the developing world.

00:20:52.690 --> 00:20:57.610
And I realized the actual
purpose for my life

00:20:57.610 --> 00:21:00.190
is to try and bring as much
positivity and well-being

00:21:00.190 --> 00:21:04.720
into the world as I
can and enabling others

00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:07.420
to reach their full potential,
which education I believe

00:21:07.420 --> 00:21:10.560
does most, is the path that
I've pursued since then.

00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:13.060
JESSE MICHELS: And how would
you advise somebody who's maybe

00:21:13.060 --> 00:21:14.710
in that situation,
where they're kind

00:21:14.710 --> 00:21:18.310
of on the linear path toward
success, to break out of it?

00:21:18.310 --> 00:21:20.290
Is it kind of getting
out there and seeing

00:21:20.290 --> 00:21:21.451
the undeveloped world?

00:21:21.451 --> 00:21:23.200
ADAM BRAUN: You know,
my advice has always

00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:26.500
been that true
self-discovery begins

00:21:26.500 --> 00:21:28.090
where your comfort zone ends.

00:21:28.090 --> 00:21:32.290
And so the surest way
to get to that place

00:21:32.290 --> 00:21:34.390
where you feel most
alive or you have

00:21:34.390 --> 00:21:37.270
this deep ingrained
sense of purpose

00:21:37.270 --> 00:21:39.340
is by leaving your
current comfort zone.

00:21:39.340 --> 00:21:42.329
And for some, it's physical
relocation-- go traveling.

00:21:42.329 --> 00:21:44.620
You go on a trip to a kind
of remote part of the world.

00:21:44.620 --> 00:21:46.144
But I don't think
that's necessary.

00:21:46.144 --> 00:21:48.310
In other capacities, it's
changing the relationships

00:21:48.310 --> 00:21:49.300
around you.

00:21:49.300 --> 00:21:52.450
It's changing what your
day-to-day actual routine looks

00:21:52.450 --> 00:21:54.730
like, exposure to new
hobbies that you never

00:21:54.730 --> 00:21:57.010
thought that you'd
actually be interested in.

00:21:57.010 --> 00:21:59.560
All of those things, I
think, help us get unstuck

00:21:59.560 --> 00:22:03.190
from what we are and what
people and society and norms

00:22:03.190 --> 00:22:06.550
dictate we're supposed to
be, into who we truly are.

00:22:06.550 --> 00:22:08.770
And then the final
thing is I think

00:22:08.770 --> 00:22:11.590
you can just learn from the
template of others before you.

00:22:11.590 --> 00:22:13.000
And so that means reading books.

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:15.280
I listen to a ton of podcasts.

00:22:15.280 --> 00:22:17.620
And a lot of those podcasts
are just interviews.

00:22:17.620 --> 00:22:20.290
On my way here today, I was
listening to an interview

00:22:20.290 --> 00:22:21.850
with the founder of Patagonia.

00:22:21.850 --> 00:22:23.830
And it was just so
inspiring for me

00:22:23.830 --> 00:22:27.310
over the last hour or so hearing
how different this person's

00:22:27.310 --> 00:22:30.460
path was and the decisions
that he's made historically.

00:22:30.460 --> 00:22:32.830
And it helped me
reframe the way that I

00:22:32.830 --> 00:22:35.080
might want to dictate some
of the decisions in my life

00:22:35.080 --> 00:22:36.680
as well.

00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:39.410
JESSE MICHELS: And I want to
touch on Pencils of Promise

00:22:39.410 --> 00:22:40.100
briefly.

00:22:40.100 --> 00:22:42.220
I want to focus
on MissionU today,

00:22:42.220 --> 00:22:44.150
but where is Pencils
of Promise at?

00:22:44.150 --> 00:22:47.672
How involved are you and what's
the plan for it going forward?

00:22:47.672 --> 00:22:48.380
ADAM BRAUN: Sure.

00:22:48.380 --> 00:22:52.580
So Pencils of Promise is about
130 full-time staff globally,

00:22:52.580 --> 00:22:55.506
operating in four different
countries, New York

00:22:55.506 --> 00:22:57.880
being the headquarter, but
the vast majority of our staff

00:22:57.880 --> 00:22:59.588
is from the countries
in which they work.

00:22:59.588 --> 00:23:02.060
They're Ghanaian, they're
Lao, they're Guatemalan.

00:23:02.060 --> 00:23:03.590
We do have 20
schools in Nicaragua

00:23:03.590 --> 00:23:04.730
that we built originally.

00:23:04.730 --> 00:23:06.570
We decided not to
continue expanding there.

00:23:06.570 --> 00:23:09.530
So we support that through
a partnership on the ground.

00:23:09.530 --> 00:23:13.010
We had our single biggest
growth ever in 2017,

00:23:13.010 --> 00:23:14.100
which is hugely exciting.

00:23:14.100 --> 00:23:16.490
And my role is founder
and board emeritus,

00:23:16.490 --> 00:23:19.460
which means that I'm
still involved but not

00:23:19.460 --> 00:23:20.990
on a day-to-day active basis.

00:23:20.990 --> 00:23:23.870
Decisions don't need to
go through me in order

00:23:23.870 --> 00:23:25.340
to be made and executed.

00:23:25.340 --> 00:23:27.440
But I tend to be
kind of the lightning

00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:28.700
rod for inbound interest.

00:23:28.700 --> 00:23:30.230
People will read the book,
and they'll reach out,

00:23:30.230 --> 00:23:31.938
and then I can funnel
those relationships

00:23:31.938 --> 00:23:35.090
to the organization as the
host of our annual gala, which

00:23:35.090 --> 00:23:39.050
this past year raised over
$2 million in a night.

00:23:39.050 --> 00:23:40.850
So I'm still very
involved, but not

00:23:40.850 --> 00:23:43.820
on a day-to-day, full-time
role, whereas most

00:23:43.820 --> 00:23:47.302
of my day-to-day
thinking is on MissionU.

00:23:47.302 --> 00:23:49.280
JESSE MICHELS: We
have over $1 trillion

00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:50.677
in student debt in this country.

00:23:50.677 --> 00:23:51.000
It might be--

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:52.083
ADAM BRAUN: $1.4 trillion.

00:23:52.083 --> 00:23:55.380
JESSE MICHELS: $1.4
trillion, which is crazy.

00:23:55.380 --> 00:23:58.730
I remember reading a blog post,
maybe in 2008 or '09 by Mark

00:23:58.730 --> 00:24:02.390
Cuban, actually talking-- kind
of comparing student debt issue

00:24:02.390 --> 00:24:05.000
to the housing bubble, saying
we have an education bubble,

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:07.460
because students literally
are taking out all this money,

00:24:07.460 --> 00:24:09.300
and they can't flip
it for a profit,

00:24:09.300 --> 00:24:11.650
just like you would flip
a home for a profit.

00:24:11.650 --> 00:24:12.680
ADAM BRAUN: Yep.

00:24:12.680 --> 00:24:16.580
JESSE MICHELS: How exactly
is MissionU solving this?

00:24:16.580 --> 00:24:18.500
ADAM BRAUN: From spending
all the time focused

00:24:18.500 --> 00:24:20.870
on international
education, one thing

00:24:20.870 --> 00:24:23.630
that I've really
seen and absorbed

00:24:23.630 --> 00:24:25.680
is that in order to
create systemic change,

00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:27.750
you need two things to happen.

00:24:27.750 --> 00:24:30.002
The first is, you
need innovation.

00:24:30.002 --> 00:24:31.460
And that innovation,
if you've read

00:24:31.460 --> 00:24:34.100
Clayton Christensen's
"Innovator's Dilemma,"

00:24:34.100 --> 00:24:35.300
it occurs on the fringes.

00:24:35.300 --> 00:24:36.140
It's not mainstream.

00:24:36.140 --> 00:24:38.300
It's kind of these outside
smaller players that

00:24:38.300 --> 00:24:40.720
start out really small,
and they're so small,

00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:42.470
and they're working
on something so unique

00:24:42.470 --> 00:24:44.330
that your large incumbents
literally don't even

00:24:44.330 --> 00:24:46.250
pay attention, even though
if they had replicated,

00:24:46.250 --> 00:24:47.570
they could have squashed them.

00:24:47.570 --> 00:24:51.215
And what oftentimes
occurs in systemic change

00:24:51.215 --> 00:24:53.040
is that as that
innovator on the fringe

00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:56.630
gets a demonstration of
success, what you actually need

00:24:56.630 --> 00:25:00.110
is widespread policy
adoption and advocacy that

00:25:00.110 --> 00:25:02.600
leads to a scaled impact.

00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:06.740
And so my goal, in particular
when it comes to MissionU,

00:25:06.740 --> 00:25:09.680
is for us to be that innovator
on the fringe that demonstrates

00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:12.200
success and then
eventually has policy

00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:14.090
adoption at the national level.

00:25:14.090 --> 00:25:16.910
And then essentially what the
US does, a lot of countries

00:25:16.910 --> 00:25:18.020
obviously follow.

00:25:18.020 --> 00:25:19.520
So a small example
would be the fact

00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:22.550
that we're using 100%
income share agreement

00:25:22.550 --> 00:25:24.500
rather than traditional tuition.

00:25:24.500 --> 00:25:27.470
The fact that we're doing that
is putting a lot of pressure

00:25:27.470 --> 00:25:29.420
on traditional
colleges to respond.

00:25:29.420 --> 00:25:31.070
And my hope is, I
don't expect to see

00:25:31.070 --> 00:25:33.560
every college be 100% IRA--

00:25:33.560 --> 00:25:35.990
Income Share Agreement--
but what I do expect to see

00:25:35.990 --> 00:25:38.330
is for colleges to
be expected to start

00:25:38.330 --> 00:25:40.310
to have some skin in
the game and eventually

00:25:40.310 --> 00:25:43.010
for policy to
actually mandate that,

00:25:43.010 --> 00:25:45.890
for students not to be required
to pay back until they reach

00:25:45.890 --> 00:25:47.473
a certain threshold,
which is actually

00:25:47.473 --> 00:25:50.840
the national policy in
countries like Australia,

00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:53.300
as well as this blended learning
model to be demonstrated

00:25:53.300 --> 00:25:54.175
as a proof one by us.

00:25:54.175 --> 00:25:56.508
There are other companies
that are doing it and doing it

00:25:56.508 --> 00:25:58.130
with great success,
and for then that

00:25:58.130 --> 00:26:00.380
to get adopted by a
lot of the mainstream

00:26:00.380 --> 00:26:02.102
incumbents as well as policy.

00:26:02.102 --> 00:26:03.560
JESSE MICHELS: Now,
you started out

00:26:03.560 --> 00:26:06.920
with Pencils of Promise kind
of focusing on accessibility

00:26:06.920 --> 00:26:10.460
and getting as many students
around the world educated

00:26:10.460 --> 00:26:13.100
as possible.

00:26:13.100 --> 00:26:15.860
Peter Thiel talks about the
current college education

00:26:15.860 --> 00:26:18.080
system, and he says it's
almost like a nightclub,

00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:22.020
like if you expand it
and allow more people in,

00:26:22.020 --> 00:26:25.482
they'll be very angry
because basically their bread

00:26:25.482 --> 00:26:26.440
and butter is prestige.

00:26:26.440 --> 00:26:26.650
ADAM BRAUN: Exclusivity.

00:26:26.650 --> 00:26:27.608
JESSE MICHELS: Exactly.

00:26:27.608 --> 00:26:28.830
Exclusivity.

00:26:28.830 --> 00:26:32.180
So how do you reconcile those
two things, kind of it's

00:26:32.180 --> 00:26:34.850
the social credential
where prestigious

00:26:34.850 --> 00:26:37.610
may be semi-important,
along with accessibility

00:26:37.610 --> 00:26:39.630
and reaching as many
people as possible?

00:26:39.630 --> 00:26:40.338
ADAM BRAUN: Yeah.

00:26:40.338 --> 00:26:43.310
So this is a big thing for us,
and it's currently a challenge

00:26:43.310 --> 00:26:46.560
that we're addressing
through scale.

00:26:46.560 --> 00:26:48.710
So we launched March 2017.

00:26:48.710 --> 00:26:49.592
We said we're open.

00:26:49.592 --> 00:26:50.300
This is MissionU.

00:26:50.300 --> 00:26:52.816
No one really had any
public exposure to it.

00:26:52.816 --> 00:26:55.190
We asked everyone that knew
about it to not talk about it

00:26:55.190 --> 00:26:56.439
until we were ready to launch.

00:26:56.439 --> 00:26:59.570
We launched March 21, 2017,
and we said this is MissionU.

00:26:59.570 --> 00:27:01.190
You can apply as of today.

00:27:01.190 --> 00:27:03.920
And we spent no money on
any form of paid marketing.

00:27:03.920 --> 00:27:06.440
And we said we just want to
see organically what happens.

00:27:06.440 --> 00:27:08.930
I did interviews and podcasts
and stuff and prospected up.

00:27:08.930 --> 00:27:11.419
But we did no
targeted marketing.

00:27:11.419 --> 00:27:13.460
So we allowed the message
to spread to the places

00:27:13.460 --> 00:27:14.793
where it might spread naturally.

00:27:14.793 --> 00:27:17.570
And we said, we have
25 spots per cohort.

00:27:17.570 --> 00:27:19.400
We'll just see how
many people apply.

00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:22.550
And we had 4,700 applicants
for the first 25 spots

00:27:22.550 --> 00:27:24.750
in about a 2 and
1/2 month period.

00:27:24.750 --> 00:27:27.340
And we said, oh, my gosh.

00:27:27.340 --> 00:27:29.510
There's some lightning
in a bottle here.

00:27:29.510 --> 00:27:34.936
And our goal is not to be the
most exclusive selective higher

00:27:34.936 --> 00:27:36.560
education program in
the country, which

00:27:36.560 --> 00:27:37.851
statistically we are right now.

00:27:37.851 --> 00:27:41.750
We have essentially a
0.5% acceptance rate.

00:27:41.750 --> 00:27:44.687
We don't want to be that,
but we are at the moment.

00:27:44.687 --> 00:27:46.520
So we said, one, we
need to go out and raise

00:27:46.520 --> 00:27:49.294
more capital so we can
offer additional cohorts.

00:27:49.294 --> 00:27:50.960
We don't want to
change the cohort size.

00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:53.600
We think about 25 is the
best number for people

00:27:53.600 --> 00:27:55.460
to build those tight
relationships, to have

00:27:55.460 --> 00:27:57.770
the right ratio to instructors.

00:27:57.770 --> 00:28:00.620
But we need to have
additional times in the year

00:28:00.620 --> 00:28:02.600
when people could apply,
concurrently launch

00:28:02.600 --> 00:28:04.970
cohorts at the same
time in the same cities,

00:28:04.970 --> 00:28:07.850
expand to new cities, as
well as offer new majors.

00:28:07.850 --> 00:28:10.850
So we went out, we raised
another round of capital

00:28:10.850 --> 00:28:13.160
from some incredible
people, and then

00:28:13.160 --> 00:28:14.810
we opened up
admissions for January.

00:28:14.810 --> 00:28:16.435
We said, OK, you can
apply for January.

00:28:16.435 --> 00:28:18.650
And we had 5,500 people
apply for those spots,

00:28:18.650 --> 00:28:20.690
and now we're running
admissions for May.

00:28:20.690 --> 00:28:25.705
And so again we
acknowledge that this

00:28:25.705 --> 00:28:27.080
is a real challenge
in higher ed,

00:28:27.080 --> 00:28:29.579
and our goal is to try and scale
quickly to serve that need.

00:28:29.579 --> 00:28:31.400
But at the same time,
we want to create

00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:33.320
a truly world-class,
high-quality experience

00:28:33.320 --> 00:28:34.500
for every student.

00:28:34.500 --> 00:28:36.830
And we know that we need to
start slowly and test out

00:28:36.830 --> 00:28:37.510
this model.

00:28:37.510 --> 00:28:40.010
And once it's really tightly
refined on the curricular side,

00:28:40.010 --> 00:28:41.570
on the student
experience side, then

00:28:41.570 --> 00:28:42.892
scale really, really rapidly.

00:28:42.892 --> 00:28:45.350
I mean, our goal is to serve
tens of thousands of students,

00:28:45.350 --> 00:28:47.995
ideally be larger than any
current college in the country.

00:28:47.995 --> 00:28:50.270
JESSE MICHELS: Awesome.

00:28:50.270 --> 00:28:52.130
What does a real-world
approach mean?

00:28:52.130 --> 00:28:54.920
You guys talk about teaching
practical skills, as opposed

00:28:54.920 --> 00:28:56.450
to maybe more theoretical ones.

00:28:56.450 --> 00:28:57.830
ADAM BRAUN: Yeah.

00:28:57.830 --> 00:29:01.460
So first of all, it means having
a really tight pulse on what's

00:29:01.460 --> 00:29:03.110
happening in industry.

00:29:03.110 --> 00:29:05.586
So designing and building
curriculum in a vacuum,

00:29:05.586 --> 00:29:08.210
having to go through a three to
four-year accreditation process

00:29:08.210 --> 00:29:09.530
and then saying
you should go learn

00:29:09.530 --> 00:29:11.238
this, as all of you,
I'm sure, experience

00:29:11.238 --> 00:29:13.340
on a day-to-day basis here
at a place like Google,

00:29:13.340 --> 00:29:15.673
is going to leave you well
behind what's actually needed

00:29:15.673 --> 00:29:17.130
to solve the needs of industry.

00:29:17.130 --> 00:29:20.510
So part of it is having these
deep relationships with folks

00:29:20.510 --> 00:29:23.330
at companies to understand
what's needed to actually hit

00:29:23.330 --> 00:29:24.290
the ground running.

00:29:24.290 --> 00:29:28.430
The second is, I think,
a profound acknowledgment

00:29:28.430 --> 00:29:32.150
that you need to bring that
real world into the curricular

00:29:32.150 --> 00:29:32.960
design.

00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:35.420
And so, as I mentioned,
we have our--

00:29:35.420 --> 00:29:38.510
I went to a great college,
and I loved my experience.

00:29:38.510 --> 00:29:42.980
But I don't think more than
once did I ever get exposure

00:29:42.980 --> 00:29:45.380
to a public speaker who came
in and addressed a class

00:29:45.380 --> 00:29:48.860
that I was in that actually
was working at a company.

00:29:48.860 --> 00:29:50.000
It was so rare.

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:52.040
And so for our
students, last week

00:29:52.040 --> 00:29:54.350
the global head of artist
marketing at Spotify

00:29:54.350 --> 00:29:56.340
spent an hour just with
a group of 30 students.

00:29:56.340 --> 00:29:57.810
And that's like
on a weekly basis,

00:29:57.810 --> 00:30:00.756
a top-tier person comes
in and addresses them.

00:30:00.756 --> 00:30:02.630
But then the second is
actually teaching them

00:30:02.630 --> 00:30:05.000
things that are going to
be applicable to getting

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:07.740
a great job, to navigating
their personal life as well.

00:30:07.740 --> 00:30:09.470
So we teach personal finance.

00:30:09.470 --> 00:30:11.949
How many people here
got a deep introduction

00:30:11.949 --> 00:30:13.490
to personal finance,
how you actually

00:30:13.490 --> 00:30:16.550
navigate your financial
scenario once you

00:30:16.550 --> 00:30:18.950
leave the bounds of your
educational experience?

00:30:18.950 --> 00:30:20.630
Everyone's nodding
their head no.

00:30:20.630 --> 00:30:21.870
So things like that.

00:30:21.870 --> 00:30:24.560
We have a class
that we call Success

00:30:24.560 --> 00:30:26.444
By Design, which is
really about finding

00:30:26.444 --> 00:30:27.860
your internal
happiness, where you

00:30:27.860 --> 00:30:29.870
want to point your
compass in life, and why.

00:30:29.870 --> 00:30:31.510
All of those
things, I think, are

00:30:31.510 --> 00:30:33.570
applicable to a
real-world context.

00:30:33.570 --> 00:30:35.420
And then finally,
our students work

00:30:35.420 --> 00:30:37.620
on projects that are based
on real-world scenarios.

00:30:37.620 --> 00:30:40.914
So we'll get dummy data
from real companies that

00:30:40.914 --> 00:30:42.080
are facing a real challenge.

00:30:42.080 --> 00:30:44.730
Our students will work through
that, produce a final project.

00:30:44.730 --> 00:30:46.105
And then that
after they ship it,

00:30:46.105 --> 00:30:48.800
they can, one, publicly present
it as part of their portfolio,

00:30:48.800 --> 00:30:50.717
but oftentimes they
actually get to present it

00:30:50.717 --> 00:30:52.633
to somebody who's working
on that real project

00:30:52.633 --> 00:30:53.570
at that real company.

00:30:53.570 --> 00:30:55.700
And they get that
cycle of feedback.

00:30:55.700 --> 00:30:58.640
And then the final part is
just the back third of the year

00:30:58.640 --> 00:31:02.540
is actually working full time at
a great company or organization

00:31:02.540 --> 00:31:05.360
and then getting additional
curricular support from us

00:31:05.360 --> 00:31:07.010
throughout that process.

00:31:07.010 --> 00:31:09.530
JESSE MICHELS: Yeah, one of the
perks we have here at Google

00:31:09.530 --> 00:31:12.580
is we get to speak to
financial advisors,

00:31:12.580 --> 00:31:15.800
and I think this was my
first job out of school,

00:31:15.800 --> 00:31:17.102
and I didn't know anything.

00:31:17.102 --> 00:31:17.810
ADAM BRAUN: Yeah.

00:31:17.810 --> 00:31:19.280
JESSE MICHELS: And I think most
people don't know anything.

00:31:19.280 --> 00:31:19.520
ADAM BRAUN: Right.

00:31:19.520 --> 00:31:21.050
JESSE MICHELS: They don't
know what a 401(k) is.

00:31:21.050 --> 00:31:21.590
ADAM BRAUN: Yeah.

00:31:21.590 --> 00:31:23.423
One of the things that
we teach our students

00:31:23.423 --> 00:31:25.130
is salary negotiation.

00:31:25.130 --> 00:31:27.710
And I remember sitting
with a reporter

00:31:27.710 --> 00:31:30.805
from a major media
company explaining that.

00:31:30.805 --> 00:31:32.930
And she was in her mid-thirties
and she said, jeez,

00:31:32.930 --> 00:31:34.669
I wish I got that.

00:31:34.669 --> 00:31:35.960
And so we think it's important.

00:31:35.960 --> 00:31:37.730
And our students
range from 18 to 39.

00:31:37.730 --> 00:31:40.810
Some of them have transferred
in from top-tier colleges.

00:31:40.810 --> 00:31:42.890
Some of them have
bachelor's degrees.

00:31:42.890 --> 00:31:45.322
Most of them have some type
of college but not BA yet

00:31:45.322 --> 00:31:46.780
and are looking
out and saying, why

00:31:46.780 --> 00:31:47.940
would I take on
this much more debt

00:31:47.940 --> 00:31:50.120
to get this piece of
paper that isn't actually

00:31:50.120 --> 00:31:52.619
going to be of greatest value,
whereas MissionU will be.

00:31:52.619 --> 00:31:55.160
JESSE MICHELS: There seems to
be a special interest right now

00:31:55.160 --> 00:31:57.180
on learning how to learn.

00:31:57.180 --> 00:31:59.900
That's actually the most popular
course on Coursera right now.

00:31:59.900 --> 00:32:02.210
Barbara Oakley teaches it.

00:32:02.210 --> 00:32:08.300
Do you guys incorporate the most
recent neuroscientific findings

00:32:08.300 --> 00:32:10.190
and findings about
just how to learn

00:32:10.190 --> 00:32:13.460
and how cognition
happens in MissionU?

00:32:13.460 --> 00:32:14.450
ADAM BRAUN: Yeah.

00:32:14.450 --> 00:32:16.680
This is the obsession
of my co-founder, Mike.

00:32:16.680 --> 00:32:18.200
So Mike's our Chief
Product Officer,

00:32:18.200 --> 00:32:20.550
and he oversees both
curriculum and technologies

00:32:20.550 --> 00:32:22.629
and work with software
engineer as well.

00:32:22.629 --> 00:32:24.670
So all this stuff that
you were seeing on Google,

00:32:24.670 --> 00:32:28.100
he's overseeing and designing
with Jen, who you heard.

00:32:28.100 --> 00:32:32.420
And yeah, if you saw the
slack channels of our team,

00:32:32.420 --> 00:32:34.670
like you would just think
these people are the biggest

00:32:34.670 --> 00:32:37.220
education nerds in the world.

00:32:37.220 --> 00:32:39.640
So yeah, we obsess and kind
of geek out over that stuff.

00:32:39.640 --> 00:32:41.950
And then we have
incredible advisors

00:32:41.950 --> 00:32:44.500
like Dr. Tony Wagner from
Harvard or Fern Mandelbaum

00:32:44.500 --> 00:32:46.190
from the lecture at Stanford.

00:32:46.190 --> 00:32:49.900
And so we're constantly kind
of digging into the latest

00:32:49.900 --> 00:32:51.340
learning science.

00:32:51.340 --> 00:32:54.576
Part of that applies into
how the actual structure

00:32:54.576 --> 00:32:55.450
of the program looks.

00:32:55.450 --> 00:32:58.730
So for example, we tell
every student that--

00:32:58.730 --> 00:33:01.119
so one thing that I'll
share is I actually call

00:33:01.119 --> 00:33:02.410
every student when they get in.

00:33:02.410 --> 00:33:03.910
So the actual
admissions acceptance

00:33:03.910 --> 00:33:06.730
is me calling them
kind of as a surprise,

00:33:06.730 --> 00:33:09.367
and they always answer and
say, hi, who's calling?

00:33:09.367 --> 00:33:10.450
And I say it's Adam Braun.

00:33:10.450 --> 00:33:12.670
I'm from MissionU, and then
they're like, oh, uh, hi.

00:33:12.670 --> 00:33:13.720
How's it going?

00:33:13.720 --> 00:33:14.775
What's up?

00:33:14.775 --> 00:33:16.150
And then I'll say
how's your day?

00:33:16.150 --> 00:33:17.691
And they say it's
good, and I'll say,

00:33:17.691 --> 00:33:19.270
OK well, hopefully
it's a lot better,

00:33:19.270 --> 00:33:20.500
because I wanted to share
with you that you got in.

00:33:20.500 --> 00:33:21.410
And they're all excited.

00:33:21.410 --> 00:33:22.680
And then I kind of
walk them through,

00:33:22.680 --> 00:33:23.620
hey, here's the next steps.

00:33:23.620 --> 00:33:24.828
Here is the orientation date.

00:33:24.828 --> 00:33:27.790
We'll send you an email and
repeat a lot of this stuff

00:33:27.790 --> 00:33:28.970
so you have it in writing.

00:33:28.970 --> 00:33:30.430
But I want to get them
comfortable with a couple

00:33:30.430 --> 00:33:31.513
of the high-level details.

00:33:31.513 --> 00:33:33.940
And one thing I share is that
you can work a part-time job

00:33:33.940 --> 00:33:35.020
while you're going
through our program,

00:33:35.020 --> 00:33:36.725
but you can't exceed
20 hours a week.

00:33:36.725 --> 00:33:38.350
And that's grounded
in learning science

00:33:38.350 --> 00:33:42.610
that shows that if you exceed
20 hours a week of a job

00:33:42.610 --> 00:33:45.500
while you're trying to focus on
a primary academic commitment,

00:33:45.500 --> 00:33:47.750
your success in that program
really falls off the map.

00:33:47.750 --> 00:33:50.390
So things like that
are applicable for us.

00:33:50.390 --> 00:33:52.460
JESSE MICHELS: And
kind of reconciling

00:33:52.460 --> 00:33:54.890
teaching practical skills
and emphasizing that

00:33:54.890 --> 00:33:58.820
with just a liberal arts
education to begin with,

00:33:58.820 --> 00:34:01.220
I can imagine where you
kind of fall on that.

00:34:01.220 --> 00:34:02.990
But there are people
like Fareed Zakaria

00:34:02.990 --> 00:34:05.369
who talk about the
loss of liberal arts

00:34:05.369 --> 00:34:06.410
education in the country.

00:34:06.410 --> 00:34:08.840
I went to Columbia,
and I'm still

00:34:08.840 --> 00:34:11.389
trying to figure out whether
reading Plato helps me

00:34:11.389 --> 00:34:12.500
every day.

00:34:12.500 --> 00:34:15.510
But yeah, where do
you stand on that?

00:34:15.510 --> 00:34:18.870
ADAM BRAUN: Yeah, my belief
on this is very firm.

00:34:18.870 --> 00:34:20.690
I think there is
tremendous value

00:34:20.690 --> 00:34:23.550
in the ideals behind a
liberal arts education.

00:34:23.550 --> 00:34:28.730
So self-discovery, critical
thinking, reasoning, morality,

00:34:28.730 --> 00:34:31.000
all of these things are
really, really essential

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:33.210
as part of a
formative education.

00:34:33.210 --> 00:34:36.170
The problem is, those things
are actually not taught

00:34:36.170 --> 00:34:39.020
in a meaningful capacity in the
vast majority of liberal arts

00:34:39.020 --> 00:34:40.130
programs in this country.

00:34:40.130 --> 00:34:42.170
What liberal arts
has kind of become

00:34:42.170 --> 00:34:44.120
is general education,
where you're just

00:34:44.120 --> 00:34:46.280
asked to read a series of
texts and suddenly you're

00:34:46.280 --> 00:34:48.620
supposed to be expected
to achieve these things.

00:34:48.620 --> 00:34:51.020
So some schools do
it well but very few.

00:34:51.020 --> 00:34:53.533
The two places that I think
that it's best achieved

00:34:53.533 --> 00:34:55.699
are through two courses
that are taught at Stanford.

00:34:55.699 --> 00:34:57.115
One is called
Designing Your Life.

00:34:57.115 --> 00:35:00.530
It's the most popular class
in undergrad at Stanford.

00:35:00.530 --> 00:35:04.250
And then the second is called
interpersonal dynamics, taught

00:35:04.250 --> 00:35:06.860
at Stanford GSP, but
known as Touchy-Feely.

00:35:06.860 --> 00:35:09.629
And if anyone here has
gone to GSP or know

00:35:09.629 --> 00:35:11.420
someone that's gone
GSP, this is the course

00:35:11.420 --> 00:35:14.040
that they will say is the most
transformative in their life.

00:35:14.040 --> 00:35:15.800
And so we actually
have former lecturers

00:35:15.800 --> 00:35:19.730
from those two courses who are
full time on staff in MissionU.

00:35:19.730 --> 00:35:21.320
And our students go
through something

00:35:21.320 --> 00:35:23.220
that is very, very similar.

00:35:23.220 --> 00:35:26.510
We call it iLabs or similar
to the T groups there.

00:35:26.510 --> 00:35:29.720
And when you mix that with
the hard technical skills,

00:35:29.720 --> 00:35:31.640
that's actually when
you create a really

00:35:31.640 --> 00:35:33.349
profound transformation
in an individual.

00:35:33.349 --> 00:35:35.223
So I think it's important
that we incorporate

00:35:35.223 --> 00:35:37.520
the ideals of a liberal
arts but that you mix it

00:35:37.520 --> 00:35:41.240
with the actual hard and soft
skills that will help somebody

00:35:41.240 --> 00:35:43.634
get a job to pay back
the debt that they've

00:35:43.634 --> 00:35:45.800
taken on, if they gone to
a traditional liberal arts

00:35:45.800 --> 00:35:46.970
school.

00:35:46.970 --> 00:35:49.190
And we really seek to
blend that at MissionU.

00:35:49.190 --> 00:35:51.200
JESSE MICHELS: So
is that really how

00:35:51.200 --> 00:35:55.107
you stay away from being
considered like a trade school?

00:35:55.107 --> 00:35:56.940
Because there are a lot
of schools out there

00:35:56.940 --> 00:35:59.710
that are like, I don't
like my career right now,

00:35:59.710 --> 00:36:01.880
and so I'll switch
and go to this school.

00:36:01.880 --> 00:36:03.561
And then it's just
kind of a pivot.

00:36:03.561 --> 00:36:04.310
ADAM BRAUN: Right.

00:36:04.310 --> 00:36:05.540
JESSE MICHELS: Is that
how you kind of stray away

00:36:05.540 --> 00:36:07.250
from that, by having
these kind of structures?

00:36:07.250 --> 00:36:08.690
ADAM BRAUN: Yeah, I
think what we've seen

00:36:08.690 --> 00:36:10.880
is there's a lot of schools
that are out there that

00:36:10.880 --> 00:36:13.760
are very effective at helping
you get into a new industry

00:36:13.760 --> 00:36:15.110
and lock in a first job.

00:36:15.110 --> 00:36:16.210
That's not our goal.

00:36:16.210 --> 00:36:18.920
Our students only
send us $1 if they're

00:36:18.920 --> 00:36:21.300
successful not only
in getting the job,

00:36:21.300 --> 00:36:23.850
but they need to be successful
for three-plus years.

00:36:23.850 --> 00:36:27.050
And so we want to prepare
them for an extraordinary life

00:36:27.050 --> 00:36:28.239
and career ahead.

00:36:28.239 --> 00:36:30.530
And part of that is learning
this hard technical skill,

00:36:30.530 --> 00:36:32.330
but actually a
much bigger part is

00:36:32.330 --> 00:36:34.760
the soft skills and that
holistic self-development.

00:36:34.760 --> 00:36:37.610
And if you spoke to any
student that's at MissionU,

00:36:37.610 --> 00:36:40.040
they'll say that
they needed one to be

00:36:40.040 --> 00:36:42.500
able to succeed in the
other, that when they really

00:36:42.500 --> 00:36:45.500
hit that kind of sticking
point in learning Python or SQL

00:36:45.500 --> 00:36:48.080
or Excel modeling, it's actually
the group discussion that

00:36:48.080 --> 00:36:49.850
will happen in iLab
that gives them

00:36:49.850 --> 00:36:52.050
the confidence and
the self-awareness

00:36:52.050 --> 00:36:54.050
to be able to progress
through those challenges.

00:36:54.050 --> 00:36:56.300
JESSE MICHELS: Do you have
kind of like a 10-year game

00:36:56.300 --> 00:36:57.200
plan for MissionU?

00:36:57.200 --> 00:36:59.360
It seems like
right now you might

00:36:59.360 --> 00:37:01.665
be going kind of
the Uber-Tesla model

00:37:01.665 --> 00:37:04.290
where you start kind of premium
and then you kind of widen out.

00:37:04.290 --> 00:37:04.998
ADAM BRAUN: Yeah.

00:37:04.998 --> 00:37:06.512
JESSE MICHELS: What's the plan?

00:37:06.512 --> 00:37:07.220
ADAM BRAUN: Yeah.

00:37:07.220 --> 00:37:10.195
So one, Pencil of Promise
is in its 10th year.

00:37:10.195 --> 00:37:12.320
And if you would have told
me at the beginning when

00:37:12.320 --> 00:37:14.507
I was trying to build
one school and riding

00:37:14.507 --> 00:37:16.340
my motorbike with the
backpack in rural Alps

00:37:16.340 --> 00:37:19.580
by myself that this year
we'd likely break ground

00:37:19.580 --> 00:37:22.590
on our 500th school, I would
have said that's insane.

00:37:22.590 --> 00:37:26.120
And so I think it's challenging
to project 10 years out.

00:37:26.120 --> 00:37:28.760
That said, the
ambition is certainly

00:37:28.760 --> 00:37:31.909
within 10 years for us to
be in dozens of cities.

00:37:31.909 --> 00:37:33.450
Again, everyone
lives within 50 miles

00:37:33.450 --> 00:37:34.991
so they can come
together frequently.

00:37:34.991 --> 00:37:38.210
But the 50-mile radius
allows for more affordability

00:37:38.210 --> 00:37:41.407
than just having to be
close to a downtown campus.

00:37:41.407 --> 00:37:42.740
So we'll be in dozens of cities.

00:37:42.740 --> 00:37:46.790
We'll be offering, I would
imagine, 10-plus majors.

00:37:46.790 --> 00:37:51.530
And I think 10 years from
now, parents and children

00:37:51.530 --> 00:37:54.080
will essentially
look at MissionU,

00:37:54.080 --> 00:37:55.970
and I assume others
will follow our lead

00:37:55.970 --> 00:37:57.890
and create similar
types of programs.

00:37:57.890 --> 00:38:00.230
And it will be a
real consideration

00:38:00.230 --> 00:38:02.632
for every student that
is considering college,

00:38:02.632 --> 00:38:04.340
whether they're fresh
out of high school,

00:38:04.340 --> 00:38:07.430
mid-career, working
adult, is do I

00:38:07.430 --> 00:38:09.200
go to one of these
traditional four

00:38:09.200 --> 00:38:11.040
to six-years that's
a little bit outdated

00:38:11.040 --> 00:38:13.310
or do I go through
something like a MissionU?

00:38:13.310 --> 00:38:15.894
And it will just be part of the
landscape of higher education.

00:38:15.894 --> 00:38:17.393
JESSE MICHELS: And
are you convinced

00:38:17.393 --> 00:38:20.090
that going forward a classroom
is the best kind of medium

00:38:20.090 --> 00:38:22.466
or setting to learn?

00:38:22.466 --> 00:38:25.190
ADAM BRAUN: I think it depends
on how you define a classroom.

00:38:25.190 --> 00:38:27.410
So a classroom does
not need to have

00:38:27.410 --> 00:38:29.900
four physical walls around it.

00:38:29.900 --> 00:38:33.440
If I showed you the
engagement of our students,

00:38:33.440 --> 00:38:36.530
it looks like a Brady
Bunch style set of screens.

00:38:36.530 --> 00:38:38.540
Our admissions process
actually replicates that

00:38:38.540 --> 00:38:41.780
through a group challenge, where
we have total strangers design

00:38:41.780 --> 00:38:45.261
actually on a Google Drive.

00:38:45.261 --> 00:38:46.760
We give them an
ambiguous challenge,

00:38:46.760 --> 00:38:49.040
and then they actually build a
presentation in Google Sheets

00:38:49.040 --> 00:38:51.360
together in 45 minutes and
present it to our staff.

00:38:51.360 --> 00:38:54.490
And we record the whole thing on
Zoom and Go and watch it back.

00:38:54.490 --> 00:38:58.440
And so I think that, to me,
is a version of a classroom.

00:38:58.440 --> 00:39:01.170
What I would say is a medium
through which individuals

00:39:01.170 --> 00:39:04.170
are able to communicate in
a live, synchronous manner

00:39:04.170 --> 00:39:07.480
with intimacy and honesty
is the best way to learn.

00:39:07.480 --> 00:39:09.870
It's certainly better
than doing it by yourself,

00:39:09.870 --> 00:39:11.940
unless you have a direct tutor.

00:39:11.940 --> 00:39:13.790
So some type of
human engagement.

00:39:13.790 --> 00:39:17.520
And that can be a classroom of
sorts, you and another person,

00:39:17.520 --> 00:39:19.920
and I don't think that large
lecture halls are the way

00:39:19.920 --> 00:39:21.130
to do it.

00:39:21.130 --> 00:39:22.980
But I do think that
there's tremendous power

00:39:22.980 --> 00:39:25.432
in these small group
cohort-based formats,

00:39:25.432 --> 00:39:27.390
in particular, behind a
screen where everything

00:39:27.390 --> 00:39:30.056
is being recorded and where
you truly feel accountable.

00:39:30.056 --> 00:39:32.430
JESSE MICHELS: I want to move
on to you briefly before we

00:39:32.430 --> 00:39:36.810
open it up to Q&amp;A. Are there
habits or philosophies that

00:39:36.810 --> 00:39:39.942
help you just perform at
a high level every day?

00:39:39.942 --> 00:39:40.650
ADAM BRAUN: Sure.

00:39:40.650 --> 00:39:41.710
This has evolved.

00:39:41.710 --> 00:39:44.730
In my 20s, it was like just
putting as much work as I can

00:39:44.730 --> 00:39:47.400
and try and respond to
everything as fast as I can

00:39:47.400 --> 00:39:49.890
and make the most of
every opportunity.

00:39:49.890 --> 00:39:51.780
And like I'll sleep
when I'm dead.

00:39:51.780 --> 00:39:53.910
That was kind of my approach.

00:39:53.910 --> 00:39:57.670
I think now in my 30s and
with a wife and two kids,

00:39:57.670 --> 00:40:00.510
I've really learned
the value of self-care.

00:40:00.510 --> 00:40:04.230
And so for example, if
I work out consistently

00:40:04.230 --> 00:40:04.990
in a given week--

00:40:04.990 --> 00:40:07.650
I mountain bike and
I play basketball--

00:40:07.650 --> 00:40:11.010
then I actually perform
much better in the office.

00:40:11.010 --> 00:40:13.200
If I'm able to meditate
for 10 to 15 minutes

00:40:13.200 --> 00:40:15.510
before the babies are up
and then my house like goes

00:40:15.510 --> 00:40:19.110
into all hell breaking
loose, then I feel much more

00:40:19.110 --> 00:40:20.820
grounded throughout the day.

00:40:20.820 --> 00:40:23.580
I use an app called Captio,
which allows me to just send

00:40:23.580 --> 00:40:24.780
quick notes to myself.

00:40:24.780 --> 00:40:26.670
And my inbox tends
to be my to-do list.

00:40:26.670 --> 00:40:30.891
And so I try and practice
Inbox Zero or some form of it.

00:40:30.891 --> 00:40:33.390
And then the other, I think,
is just treating people the way

00:40:33.390 --> 00:40:34.806
that you would
want to be treated.

00:40:34.806 --> 00:40:38.220
Are you building a culture that
really values people as people,

00:40:38.220 --> 00:40:40.950
not just as numbers
on your Excel

00:40:40.950 --> 00:40:43.650
sheet of headcount
roadmaps or your org chart?

00:40:43.650 --> 00:40:45.690
And really focus on
growing those people

00:40:45.690 --> 00:40:47.190
into the best-performing
individuals

00:40:47.190 --> 00:40:49.890
that they can and the
best people that they can

00:40:49.890 --> 00:40:52.307
leads to a really rewarding
work environment and something

00:40:52.307 --> 00:40:54.139
that you're excited to
going into every day.

00:40:54.139 --> 00:40:55.350
JESSE MICHELS: Nice.

00:40:55.350 --> 00:40:56.310
What's your why?

00:40:56.310 --> 00:40:59.930
What's the thing
that drives you?

00:40:59.930 --> 00:41:03.060
ADAM BRAUN: You know,
my why is quite simply

00:41:03.060 --> 00:41:07.410
that by every statistical
measure, I shouldn't be here.

00:41:07.410 --> 00:41:10.110
My grandparents were
meant to pass away

00:41:10.110 --> 00:41:12.000
in those concentration camps.

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:14.080
If anyone's read my book,
on "Semester At Sea,"

00:41:14.080 --> 00:41:17.670
my cruise ship was hit by a
60-foot rogue wave 800 miles

00:41:17.670 --> 00:41:20.520
from land, and we had this
Titanicesque experience where I

00:41:20.520 --> 00:41:22.770
was supposed to die that
day and somehow I didn't.

00:41:22.770 --> 00:41:27.900
And so I genuinely
feel like this life

00:41:27.900 --> 00:41:30.620
for me is one in a trillion.

00:41:30.620 --> 00:41:34.320
And so I need to do everything
that I can to honor that

00:41:34.320 --> 00:41:38.130
and both leave the
most positive mark

00:41:38.130 --> 00:41:40.260
that I can on as many
people as possible.

00:41:40.260 --> 00:41:44.220
And now as a new father, I
realize that at the same time

00:41:44.220 --> 00:41:46.254
I have to balance
that with the fact

00:41:46.254 --> 00:41:48.420
that the greatest mark that
I can leave on the world

00:41:48.420 --> 00:41:51.490
is producing great children
and being a great husband

00:41:51.490 --> 00:41:53.440
and great father and sibling.

00:41:53.440 --> 00:41:55.200
So those are the
two things for me--

00:41:55.200 --> 00:41:57.450
you know, this kind
of big scaled ambition

00:41:57.450 --> 00:41:59.279
with this very
small one that I'm

00:41:59.279 --> 00:42:01.320
most happy when I'm just
hanging out with my kids

00:42:01.320 --> 00:42:02.220
in their little room.

00:42:02.220 --> 00:42:03.980
JESSE MICHELS: Do you
have mentors or role

00:42:03.980 --> 00:42:06.480
models who've really helped you
and affected you throughout?

00:42:06.480 --> 00:42:07.188
ADAM BRAUN: Yeah.

00:42:07.188 --> 00:42:12.360
I have a bunch of mentors that
I've gathered over the years.

00:42:12.360 --> 00:42:15.090
One of them is a guy named
Ray Chambers, who is probably

00:42:15.090 --> 00:42:18.300
most responsible in the world
for eradication of malaria,

00:42:18.300 --> 00:42:21.420
became a billionaire, really
started the leveraged buyout

00:42:21.420 --> 00:42:22.290
space.

00:42:22.290 --> 00:42:25.380
And I was at lunch at one
point with a guy named

00:42:25.380 --> 00:42:27.600
Randall Lane, who is the
Editor in Chief of Forbes.

00:42:27.600 --> 00:42:29.860
And he told me that
maybe 15 or 20 years--

00:42:29.860 --> 00:42:32.730
I can't remember how long-- but
he was not the editor in chief,

00:42:32.730 --> 00:42:36.840
but he was running the Forbes
400 list as his function

00:42:36.840 --> 00:42:37.710
at the company.

00:42:37.710 --> 00:42:39.130
And Ray Chambers
was on the list,

00:42:39.130 --> 00:42:41.310
and he got a call the next
day after it came out,

00:42:41.310 --> 00:42:43.389
and this guy said how
do I get off the list?

00:42:43.389 --> 00:42:44.430
I don't want to be on it.

00:42:44.430 --> 00:42:46.260
And he said, well, you
either have to lose the money

00:42:46.260 --> 00:42:48.135
or give it away, but
we're going to report it

00:42:48.135 --> 00:42:49.170
if you're that wealthy.

00:42:49.170 --> 00:42:49.961
He said, all right.

00:42:49.961 --> 00:42:51.210
I'll be off by next year.

00:42:51.210 --> 00:42:54.060
And he committed his life
to humanitarian work.

00:42:54.060 --> 00:42:56.970
And so he's been an
incredible mentor.

00:42:56.970 --> 00:42:59.460
And then certainly
my family members--

00:42:59.460 --> 00:43:01.046
my dad, my mom, my
sister, my brother,

00:43:01.046 --> 00:43:02.670
they're the people,
as well as my wife,

00:43:02.670 --> 00:43:04.290
that I talk to most
about these decisions.

00:43:04.290 --> 00:43:05.914
JESSE MICHELS: Speaking
of your family,

00:43:05.914 --> 00:43:08.190
you have a very
high-achieving family.

00:43:08.190 --> 00:43:11.460
Adam's brother actually
manages Justin Bieber,

00:43:11.460 --> 00:43:12.540
among many other artists.

00:43:12.540 --> 00:43:12.870
ADAM BRAUN: Yeah.

00:43:12.870 --> 00:43:13.860
A lot of people.

00:43:13.860 --> 00:43:15.214
Kanye and a lot of people.

00:43:15.214 --> 00:43:16.380
JESSE MICHELS: That's right.

00:43:16.380 --> 00:43:18.840
Do you ever get competitive
with Scooter about anything?

00:43:18.840 --> 00:43:21.022
You guys couldn't have
taken more different paths.

00:43:21.022 --> 00:43:22.480
You're both very
impressive people,

00:43:22.480 --> 00:43:24.367
but do you ever get
competitive with him?

00:43:24.367 --> 00:43:26.700
ADAM BRAUN: You know, as kids
we were super competitive.

00:43:26.700 --> 00:43:29.201
I think by the time we both hit
our kind of mid to late 20s,

00:43:29.201 --> 00:43:30.825
we realized that we
were just operating

00:43:30.825 --> 00:43:31.950
in such different spaces.

00:43:31.950 --> 00:43:33.650
And the best thing
that we could do

00:43:33.650 --> 00:43:36.390
is just be unbelievably
proud of one another

00:43:36.390 --> 00:43:37.830
and try and support each other.

00:43:37.830 --> 00:43:39.996
I think if you went to a
Saturday morning basketball

00:43:39.996 --> 00:43:41.820
game where we're playing
on opposite teams,

00:43:41.820 --> 00:43:44.100
you would see us
pretty competitive.

00:43:44.100 --> 00:43:47.310
But in most things, we just try
and support one another as much

00:43:47.310 --> 00:43:47.900
as we can.

00:43:47.900 --> 00:43:49.590
JESSE MICHELS: Awesome.

00:43:49.590 --> 00:43:51.270
Do you guys have any questions?

00:43:51.270 --> 00:43:53.340
Let's open it up for Q&amp;A.
And if you do, please

00:43:53.340 --> 00:43:56.010
go to that mic right over there.

00:43:56.010 --> 00:43:58.650
AUDIENCE: I resonated with
a lot of what you said.

00:43:58.650 --> 00:44:00.630
Thanks for speaking.

00:44:00.630 --> 00:44:02.160
I was wondering if
you wouldn't mind

00:44:02.160 --> 00:44:04.080
sharing with us
some things that you

00:44:04.080 --> 00:44:08.232
tried or thought that might work
but ended up not working out.

00:44:08.232 --> 00:44:08.940
ADAM BRAUN: Sure.

00:44:12.020 --> 00:44:14.790
At Pencils of Promise,
Nicaragua was the second country

00:44:14.790 --> 00:44:18.346
that we tried to expand into,
and I built a partnership

00:44:18.346 --> 00:44:19.470
with an organization there.

00:44:19.470 --> 00:44:21.261
They kind of showed me
the lay of the land.

00:44:21.261 --> 00:44:23.970
We sent a small team
down, and it ultimately

00:44:23.970 --> 00:44:25.870
wasn't successful
for two reasons.

00:44:25.870 --> 00:44:28.767
The first was the government
was incredibly challenging.

00:44:28.767 --> 00:44:30.600
We need to work with
supportive governments,

00:44:30.600 --> 00:44:32.327
because we build public schools.

00:44:32.327 --> 00:44:34.410
The second, though, was
we did this deep analysis,

00:44:34.410 --> 00:44:36.510
and the population
density was very low,

00:44:36.510 --> 00:44:38.642
and the cost of
materials was very high.

00:44:38.642 --> 00:44:40.350
So what we saw was it
was two to 3 X more

00:44:40.350 --> 00:44:43.380
expensive to impact the same
number of lives in that country

00:44:43.380 --> 00:44:45.720
than it was in the
other eventually

00:44:45.720 --> 00:44:48.750
three to four other countries
where we were working.

00:44:48.750 --> 00:44:50.460
And that was really
tough, right?

00:44:50.460 --> 00:44:52.380
You start in a country, you
actually make a commitment,

00:44:52.380 --> 00:44:53.796
you build 20
schools, and then you

00:44:53.796 --> 00:44:56.617
have to say we're not going to
continue to expand and build

00:44:56.617 --> 00:44:57.450
our own teams there.

00:44:57.450 --> 00:44:58.540
That was really hard.

00:44:58.540 --> 00:45:00.910
But I think it forced an
organizational discipline

00:45:00.910 --> 00:45:03.210
at Pencils of Promise for sure.

00:45:03.210 --> 00:45:07.199
With MissionU, anyone
who saw our pitch deck

00:45:07.199 --> 00:45:09.240
before there was even a
company, when it was just

00:45:09.240 --> 00:45:11.550
like a seed of an
idea, would tell you

00:45:11.550 --> 00:45:14.010
that the way it looks today
is remarkably similar.

00:45:14.010 --> 00:45:15.690
There's only been one
meaningful change,

00:45:15.690 --> 00:45:17.356
and that's that
originally we said we're

00:45:17.356 --> 00:45:18.642
going to have four quarters.

00:45:18.642 --> 00:45:20.100
And those quarters
were going to be

00:45:20.100 --> 00:45:21.827
hard skills in
the first quarter,

00:45:21.827 --> 00:45:23.910
soft skills in the second,
technical in the third,

00:45:23.910 --> 00:45:25.440
and then real world
in the fourth.

00:45:25.440 --> 00:45:27.300
And we realized right
away that you actually

00:45:27.300 --> 00:45:29.430
can't divorce hard
skills from soft skills,

00:45:29.430 --> 00:45:31.290
that they need to be
taught in conjunction.

00:45:31.290 --> 00:45:33.480
And so we moved over
to a trimester model,

00:45:33.480 --> 00:45:36.820
where that first trimester is
a deep dive on the foundation.

00:45:36.820 --> 00:45:38.730
And so a lot of it is
like that lean kind

00:45:38.730 --> 00:45:40.320
of mentality, the
test and iterate

00:45:40.320 --> 00:45:43.080
and get feedback
from your consumers.

00:45:46.025 --> 00:45:46.650
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:45:46.650 --> 00:45:47.600
Thanks so much for coming.

00:45:47.600 --> 00:45:48.974
It's a very
inspiring talk, and I

00:45:48.974 --> 00:45:53.450
think this MissionU concept
is a really strong one.

00:45:53.450 --> 00:45:56.000
So I guess my
general question is,

00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:58.130
this problem of
crushing student debt

00:45:58.130 --> 00:46:01.370
seems to be a uniquely
American problem.

00:46:01.370 --> 00:46:04.340
I was wondering if you,
during your research,

00:46:04.340 --> 00:46:06.950
you looked at other countries
and maybe could take away

00:46:06.950 --> 00:46:08.540
something like
either boring stuff

00:46:08.540 --> 00:46:11.690
that you could incorporate into
MissionU or are there any--

00:46:11.690 --> 00:46:15.230
this is sort of a private-sector
solution to education problem,

00:46:15.230 --> 00:46:18.230
and is there any role
for the US government

00:46:18.230 --> 00:46:22.190
that could lead to better
reforming the education system

00:46:22.190 --> 00:46:24.010
or solving the
problem that exists?

00:46:24.010 --> 00:46:25.130
ADAM BRAUN: Absolutely.

00:46:25.130 --> 00:46:27.590
So right now, there's
a new bill that's

00:46:27.590 --> 00:46:31.820
being formed that's probably the
most significant restructuring

00:46:31.820 --> 00:46:34.664
of higher education funding
in the last 40 years.

00:46:34.664 --> 00:46:36.080
So they're overhauling
essentially

00:46:36.080 --> 00:46:37.122
the Higher Education Act.

00:46:37.122 --> 00:46:39.205
And there's some stuff in
there that I agree with,

00:46:39.205 --> 00:46:40.700
there's some stuff that I don't.

00:46:40.700 --> 00:46:42.470
But I think directionally,
it's actually

00:46:42.470 --> 00:46:43.830
a move in the right direction.

00:46:43.830 --> 00:46:46.864
So one of the
things is the reason

00:46:46.864 --> 00:46:48.530
that we're in the
position that we're in

00:46:48.530 --> 00:46:49.488
is a series of factors.

00:46:49.488 --> 00:46:52.610
But one of the important ones
that the government has enabled

00:46:52.610 --> 00:46:54.440
is that an individual
can essentially

00:46:54.440 --> 00:46:56.510
take out an unlimited
line of credit

00:46:56.510 --> 00:46:59.210
at a very young age without
any demonstrated capacity

00:46:59.210 --> 00:47:00.650
to be able to pay that back.

00:47:00.650 --> 00:47:03.320
And we have this society
that's kind of encouraged

00:47:03.320 --> 00:47:05.240
through just societal
norms and expectations

00:47:05.240 --> 00:47:06.560
that you should do that.

00:47:06.560 --> 00:47:09.920
And so one thing that's
happened as a result

00:47:09.920 --> 00:47:12.980
is that there is no
market force that's

00:47:12.980 --> 00:47:15.920
creating downward pressure on
how much colleges can charge

00:47:15.920 --> 00:47:18.860
or any accountability to
the value of that college

00:47:18.860 --> 00:47:20.210
relative to the cost.

00:47:20.210 --> 00:47:23.990
So for example, I can think
of many not very good colleges

00:47:23.990 --> 00:47:26.990
that have terrible outcomes
that charge the same amount

00:47:26.990 --> 00:47:28.760
as a school like Harvard.

00:47:28.760 --> 00:47:31.520
And so that's like me being a
car salesman and saying to you,

00:47:31.520 --> 00:47:34.220
here's this Lamborghini
for $200,000

00:47:34.220 --> 00:47:36.262
or you can get this really
crappy old beat-up car

00:47:36.262 --> 00:47:38.136
that's actually not
going to drive very well,

00:47:38.136 --> 00:47:39.680
but that's $200,000 as well.

00:47:39.680 --> 00:47:43.020
And you should buy this one too.

00:47:43.020 --> 00:47:45.140
So I think that the
government needs to,

00:47:45.140 --> 00:47:46.949
one, hold schools
accountable to outcomes.

00:47:46.949 --> 00:47:48.740
And the best way to do
that is through skin

00:47:48.740 --> 00:47:52.380
in the game, some type of income
share based on student success.

00:47:52.380 --> 00:47:54.620
The second is to actually
realistically put

00:47:54.620 --> 00:47:56.549
a limit on how much
a student can borrow.

00:47:56.549 --> 00:47:57.965
And what I think
that will lead to

00:47:57.965 --> 00:48:00.271
is colleges bringing
their prices down.

00:48:00.271 --> 00:48:02.270
And the result of that
is that a lot of colleges

00:48:02.270 --> 00:48:03.755
are going to go out of
business, because they have

00:48:03.755 --> 00:48:05.250
unsustainable business models.

00:48:05.250 --> 00:48:07.620
And that's actually, I
think, a very good thing.

00:48:07.620 --> 00:48:10.040
We need to have market
forces in place that

00:48:10.040 --> 00:48:12.950
remove bad actors that
are putting students

00:48:12.950 --> 00:48:14.240
in positions of peril.

00:48:14.240 --> 00:48:16.100
And just because you're
a nonprofit college

00:48:16.100 --> 00:48:18.230
doesn't mean you're
actually helping people.

00:48:18.230 --> 00:48:20.355
And there's a lot that are
actually hurting people.

00:48:20.355 --> 00:48:23.180
So skin in the game,
capping total amounts

00:48:23.180 --> 00:48:26.990
that students can take
out, and then the third

00:48:26.990 --> 00:48:29.810
is transparency as to how much
it's actually going to cost.

00:48:29.810 --> 00:48:33.084
It's very hard if you're
an 18, 19, 40-year-old,

00:48:33.084 --> 00:48:35.000
and you're applying to
college to actually get

00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:36.410
the clear information
on how much

00:48:36.410 --> 00:48:37.784
it's eventually
going to cost you

00:48:37.784 --> 00:48:39.756
as well as the outcomes
data of those colleges.

00:48:39.756 --> 00:48:40.630
It's very convoluted.

00:48:40.630 --> 00:48:41.782
They hide it.

00:48:41.782 --> 00:48:43.490
And Congress needs to
really move forward

00:48:43.490 --> 00:48:46.786
with an effort to ensure greater
transparency in the space.

00:48:46.786 --> 00:48:49.876
AUDIENCE: It seems like there
would be a lot of forces that

00:48:49.876 --> 00:48:52.250
would kind of be operating
against those kind of reforms,

00:48:52.250 --> 00:48:55.410
like some of the colleges are at
risk of going out of business,

00:48:55.410 --> 00:48:55.910
it's--

00:48:55.910 --> 00:48:56.690
ADAM BRAUN: Definitely.

00:48:56.690 --> 00:48:58.106
It's challenging,
because you have

00:48:58.106 --> 00:49:00.980
one of the most entrenched
systems in our culture

00:49:00.980 --> 00:49:03.830
as well as our capital
allocation in the country.

00:49:03.830 --> 00:49:05.930
But what it's led to
is a position that's

00:49:05.930 --> 00:49:07.056
completely unsustainable.

00:49:07.056 --> 00:49:08.930
I read a report from
the Brookings Institute,

00:49:08.930 --> 00:49:14.200
which is as nonpartisan,
objective, and well researched

00:49:14.200 --> 00:49:16.880
as possible, that came out
last week that projected

00:49:16.880 --> 00:49:19.760
that 40% of today's
college students

00:49:19.760 --> 00:49:22.580
will default on
their loans by 2030.

00:49:22.580 --> 00:49:24.230
I mean, it's insane.

00:49:24.230 --> 00:49:27.584
So we need to have some type
of really meaningful change.

00:49:27.584 --> 00:49:29.750
And as an entrepreneur, I
look at problems like this

00:49:29.750 --> 00:49:33.290
and I say, if not me, then who?

00:49:33.290 --> 00:49:35.970
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:49:35.970 --> 00:49:36.570
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:49:36.570 --> 00:49:39.120
Thanks for the presentation.

00:49:39.120 --> 00:49:43.080
I think the problem that
MissionU solves which

00:49:43.080 --> 00:49:47.730
is about how to actually deliver
education in a system which

00:49:47.730 --> 00:49:53.880
is not exactly built up
for the huge population

00:49:53.880 --> 00:49:57.900
is probably going to apply
for the kind of countries

00:49:57.900 --> 00:50:00.315
in which Pencils for
Promise operates in.

00:50:00.315 --> 00:50:05.760
So do you see how technology
as a medium for instruction

00:50:05.760 --> 00:50:08.335
can be actually scaled to
developing countries and--

00:50:08.335 --> 00:50:09.210
ADAM BRAUN: Oh, yeah.

00:50:09.210 --> 00:50:11.124
100%.

00:50:11.124 --> 00:50:12.540
AUDIENCE: Just
finish my question.

00:50:12.540 --> 00:50:16.200
And what exactly
are the challenges

00:50:16.200 --> 00:50:19.590
that are preventing it
from happening as of today?

00:50:19.590 --> 00:50:20.860
ADAM BRAUN: OK.

00:50:20.860 --> 00:50:23.160
So great question.

00:50:23.160 --> 00:50:25.320
One, when I talk about
that 10-year vision,

00:50:25.320 --> 00:50:28.189
when I say we'll be in dozens
of cities around the world,

00:50:28.189 --> 00:50:29.730
many of them should
be international.

00:50:29.730 --> 00:50:32.441
So 18% of our applicants
are international.

00:50:32.441 --> 00:50:34.190
You have to have a
visa to work in the US,

00:50:34.190 --> 00:50:36.510
because we need to recuperate
our investment in you

00:50:36.510 --> 00:50:38.760
through livable wages.

00:50:38.760 --> 00:50:41.490
And so we can't take those
students on currently.

00:50:41.490 --> 00:50:45.270
But we've had applicants from
dozens of other countries.

00:50:45.270 --> 00:50:47.614
I recently gave a talk
in Singapore about this.

00:50:47.614 --> 00:50:49.780
And the main question from
all these representatives

00:50:49.780 --> 00:50:52.950
of the different countries was
how soon can this come here?

00:50:52.950 --> 00:50:55.510
And so we certainly have
ambitions to scale globally.

00:50:55.510 --> 00:50:57.990
I think right now,
part of the challenge

00:50:57.990 --> 00:51:01.470
is the ability to deliver
live synchronous education

00:51:01.470 --> 00:51:03.480
over low bandwidth internet.

00:51:03.480 --> 00:51:07.560
But that's increasing
exponentially every single day.

00:51:07.560 --> 00:51:11.670
And so I actually spent
a full year in 2015--

00:51:11.670 --> 00:51:15.330
I was leading the largest
digital initiative

00:51:15.330 --> 00:51:18.231
called the global Education
Platform for the UN Special

00:51:18.231 --> 00:51:20.730
Envoy for Education, which is
Gordon Brown, the former Prime

00:51:20.730 --> 00:51:21.960
Minister of the UK.

00:51:21.960 --> 00:51:25.140
And in that year, what I
spent observing and seeing

00:51:25.140 --> 00:51:28.250
was this huge proliferation of
mobile across the developing

00:51:28.250 --> 00:51:28.750
world.

00:51:28.750 --> 00:51:30.900
And so what I would
see at scale is

00:51:30.900 --> 00:51:33.180
people being able to actually
have these experiences

00:51:33.180 --> 00:51:35.610
on mobile in the
types of environments

00:51:35.610 --> 00:51:39.169
where Pencils of Promise
has historically worked.

00:51:39.169 --> 00:51:39.710
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:51:39.710 --> 00:51:40.610
My name is Terry.

00:51:40.610 --> 00:51:42.590
I'm from China.

00:51:42.590 --> 00:51:45.930
We are facing the same issue
in China, if it's not worse.

00:51:45.930 --> 00:51:47.450
So I am truly
inspired by your talk

00:51:47.450 --> 00:51:48.825
today, and thank
you for sharing.

00:51:48.825 --> 00:51:50.150
You do great work.

00:51:50.150 --> 00:51:51.410
My question is simple.

00:51:51.410 --> 00:51:54.100
If that model
works for MissionU,

00:51:54.100 --> 00:51:56.390
do you think it might work
for high school as well?

00:51:56.390 --> 00:52:00.460
Because I see no point
now, if we go to college,

00:52:00.460 --> 00:52:02.360
pay expensive tuition
and learn nothing.

00:52:02.360 --> 00:52:05.610
But high school is preparing
for that entry examination

00:52:05.610 --> 00:52:10.710
and for nothing, that's
four years likely wasted.

00:52:10.710 --> 00:52:14.190
So maybe we can just start
younger and without any time

00:52:14.190 --> 00:52:18.062
and inject hope in
these children's eyes.

00:52:18.062 --> 00:52:18.770
ADAM BRAUN: Yeah.

00:52:18.770 --> 00:52:21.900
I think our curricular
approach certainly

00:52:21.900 --> 00:52:23.580
can be adopted at the
high school level.

00:52:23.580 --> 00:52:25.496
I don't know about the
income share agreement,

00:52:25.496 --> 00:52:27.390
because some people do
want to work directly

00:52:27.390 --> 00:52:28.800
at the end of high school.

00:52:28.800 --> 00:52:30.960
But I think the curricular
approach certainly

00:52:30.960 --> 00:52:33.630
can be adopted by public
and private schools.

00:52:33.630 --> 00:52:35.280
The kind of product-based
and certainly

00:52:35.280 --> 00:52:37.290
the blended learning,
the technology

00:52:37.290 --> 00:52:39.702
can and should be used
in that capacity as well.

00:52:39.702 --> 00:52:42.642
AUDIENCE: And then one
more piece, if I may.

00:52:42.642 --> 00:52:43.683
JESSE MICHELS: Go for it.

00:52:43.683 --> 00:52:48.420
AUDIENCE: If the compensation,
I mean all the payback part,

00:52:48.420 --> 00:52:50.640
is not only measured
by the income,

00:52:50.640 --> 00:52:54.906
what else it could be for
your success in the school?

00:52:54.906 --> 00:52:57.530
ADAM BRAUN: For us, there's also
what we would consider NPS, so

00:52:57.530 --> 00:52:58.670
Net Promoter Score.

00:52:58.670 --> 00:53:00.740
That's actually just as
critical in our minds.

00:53:00.740 --> 00:53:03.830
We need to create an environment
in which our students are

00:53:03.830 --> 00:53:06.140
the single greatest
evangelists of our program.

00:53:06.140 --> 00:53:08.360
And eventually they
become really the stewards

00:53:08.360 --> 00:53:10.564
for additional innovation
within education.

00:53:10.564 --> 00:53:12.980
It's what you've seen with
Teach for America, for example,

00:53:12.980 --> 00:53:15.106
is they've certainly
seen success.

00:53:15.106 --> 00:53:17.480
They've also had controversy
but directionally incredible

00:53:17.480 --> 00:53:18.830
success.

00:53:18.830 --> 00:53:21.200
And not only the success
within the schools

00:53:21.200 --> 00:53:23.252
in which they have taught,
but their alums have

00:53:23.252 --> 00:53:25.460
gone out and become stewards
for an incredible amount

00:53:25.460 --> 00:53:27.890
of new initiatives that have
had a truly global impact.

00:53:27.890 --> 00:53:31.100
And that, for us, is absolutely
critical for long-term success.

00:53:31.100 --> 00:53:32.531
AUDIENCE: Thank you very much.

00:53:32.531 --> 00:53:34.730
ADAM BRAUN: Thank you guys.

00:53:34.730 --> 00:53:37.240
It's really an honor to
be here, and as I alluded

00:53:37.240 --> 00:53:39.760
to, Google really
powers a lot of what

00:53:39.760 --> 00:53:42.305
we do without even a formalized
partnership in place,

00:53:42.305 --> 00:53:44.680
just by the tools and technology
that you all have built.

00:53:44.680 --> 00:53:48.070
But we're really excited
to hopefully build

00:53:48.070 --> 00:53:51.100
something even more powerful
with you all and, to the extent

00:53:51.100 --> 00:53:54.250
that anyone is interested,
please just email me.

00:53:54.250 --> 00:53:57.940
We'd love to, whether it's going
to be a case study or even just

00:53:57.940 --> 00:54:00.510
a Guinea pig for new things
that you guys are developing,

00:54:00.510 --> 00:54:03.070
because we have a team that's
really eager to work with folks

00:54:03.070 --> 00:54:07.390
like you all to bring more
successful and outcomes-driven

00:54:07.390 --> 00:54:08.932
education to people
around the world.

00:54:08.932 --> 00:54:10.306
JESSE MICHELS: We
have some books

00:54:10.306 --> 00:54:12.640
as well if you want to stick
around and pick those up.

00:54:12.640 --> 00:54:15.190
Everybody, please give a
round of applause for Adam.

00:54:15.190 --> 00:54:15.490
Thank you so much.

00:54:15.490 --> 00:54:16.390
ADAM BRAUN: Thank you guy.

00:54:16.390 --> 00:54:16.990
[APPLAUSE]

00:54:16.990 --> 00:54:18.540
JESSE MICHELS: Appreciate it.
