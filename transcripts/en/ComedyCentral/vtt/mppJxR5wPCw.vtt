FRANCISCAN MONKS AND

RESTORATION ACT INTO LAW.

00:00:12.411 --> 00:00:14.213 align:start position:0% line:91%

PROTECTS A PERSON OR

00:00:14.246 --> 00:00:16.182 align:start position:0% line:91%
BUSINESS OWNER FROM
GOVERNMENT PERSECUTION WHEN

00:00:16.215 --> 00:00:18.151 align:start position:0% line:91%
FOLLOWING THEIR RELIGIOUS

00:00:18.184 --> 00:00:19.152 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Jon: HERE, HERE!

00:00:19.185 --> 00:00:22.822 align:start position:0% line:91%
I DIDN'T REALIZE THAT PEOPLE
IN INDIANA COULD NOT

00:00:22.855 --> 00:00:23.923 align:start position:0% line:85%
PRACTICE RELIGION.

00:00:23.956 --> 00:00:25.258 align:start position:0% line:85%
I'M EXCITED.

00:00:25.291 --> 00:00:28.261 align:start position:0% line:91%
I THOUGHT YOU COULD PRACTICE
RELIGION IN INDIANA BUT

00:00:28.294 --> 00:00:30.630 align:start position:0% line:91%
APPARENTLY IT IS UP TO NOW
BEEN ILLEGAL,

00:00:30.663 --> 00:00:32.832 align:start position:0% line:91%
ONE OF THOSE QUIRKY
LOCAL LAWS, I GUESS.

00:00:32.865 --> 00:00:36.502 align:start position:0% line:91%
BUT WELL, GOD BLESS, ALL'S
WELL THAT ENDS WELL.

00:00:36.535 --> 00:00:39.405 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; CRITICS SAY IT IS A
THINLY VEILED DISGUISE FOR

00:00:39.438 --> 00:00:42.475 size:88% position:44% line:91%
DISCRIMINATION AGAINST GAY
PEOPLE, ESSENTIALLY ALLOWING

00:00:42.508 --> 00:00:44.977 align:start position:0% line:91%
BUSINESSES TO DENY THEM
SERVICES FOR RELIGIOUS

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:46.212 align:start position:0% line:85%
REASONS.

00:00:46.245 --> 00:00:49.148 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon: WHAT THE [BLEEP]?
(LAUGHTER)

00:00:49.181 --> 00:00:51.651 align:start position:0% line:91%
WAIT, DENYING GAY PEOPLE FROM
RELIGIOUS -- GAY

00:00:51.684 --> 00:00:54.554 size:84% position:42% line:91%
PEOPLE AREN'T ASKING YOU TO
MAKE THEM A GAY PRODUCT.

00:00:54.587 --> 00:00:57.757 align:start position:0% line:91%
THEY'RE JUST ASKING TO BUY
THE PRODUCT YOU MAKE.

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:59.725 align:start position:0% line:91%
ALTHOUGH PERHAPS THAT
EXPLAINS THE SIGNS IN SO

00:00:59.758 --> 00:01:02.095 size:78% position:39% line:85%
MANY INDIANA STOREFRONTS.

00:01:02.128 --> 00:01:08.968 align:start position:0% line:91%
(LAUGHTER)
I CAN'T IMAGINE INDIANA

00:01:09.001 --> 00:01:11.504 size:75% position:38% line:91%
WOULD GET AWAY WITH THIS
TYPE OF DISCRIMINATION.

00:01:11.537 --> 00:01:14.607 size:88% position:44% line:91%
&gt;&gt; EVEN THE NCAA IS COMING
OUT AGAINST THE MEASURE JUST

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.211 align:start position:0% line:91%
DAYS BEFORE THE STATE'S
CAPITOL CITY HOSTS THE MEN'S

00:01:18.244 --> 00:01:20.113 size:75% position:38% line:85%
BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP.

00:01:20.146 --> 00:01:21.214 size:84% position:42% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Jon: THAT'S GOT TO HURT.

00:01:21.247 --> 00:01:23.049 align:start position:0% line:91%
WHEN ARE YOU BECOME
CRITICIZED BY A COMPANY

00:01:23.082 --> 00:01:27.854 size:84% position:42% line:91%
WHOSE ENTIRE BUSINESS MODEL
IS BASED ON EXPLOITATION.

00:01:27.887 --> 00:01:30.890 align:start position:0% line:91%
YOU CAN'T DISCRIMINATE
AGAINST GAYS, YOU CAN PROFIT

00:01:30.923 --> 00:01:33.192 align:start position:0% line:91%
ON THEIR LIKENESS WITHOUT
COMPENSATION.

00:01:33.225 --> 00:01:35.061 align:start position:0% line:85%
(LAUGHTER)

00:01:35.094 --> 00:01:35.695 align:start position:0% line:91%
HERE'S HOW YOU CAN
GET AWAY WITH IT.

00:01:35.728 --> 00:01:38.831 size:88% position:44% line:85%
JUST CALL THEM STUDENT GAYS.

00:01:38.864 --> 00:01:42.135 size:84% position:42% line:91%
AND BY THE WAY, IF YOU ARE
THINKING WELL WHO NEEDS THE

00:01:42.168 --> 00:01:44.470 align:start position:0% line:91%
NCAA ANYWAY, NOT US IN
INDIANA, WELL THAT IS WHEN THE

00:01:44.503 --> 00:01:46.472 align:start position:0% line:85%
BIG GUNS CAME OUT.

00:01:46.505 --> 00:01:49.142 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; ANGIE'S LIST C.E.O. SAYS THE
COMPANY'S EXPANSION PROJECT

00:01:49.175 --> 00:01:50.943 size:84% position:42% line:85%
IN INDIANAPOLIS IS ON HOLD.

00:01:50.976 --> 00:01:53.513 line:85%
&gt;&gt; Jon: [BLEEP] JUST GOT REAL.

00:01:53.546 --> 00:01:56.816 size:78% position:39% line:91%
WITHOUT ANGIE'S LIST, HOW
ARE YOU GOING TO FIND A

00:01:56.849 --> 00:01:58.985 align:start position:0% line:91%
TRUSTWORTHY CONTRACTOR TO
REMODEL YOUR HOUSE?

00:01:59.018 --> 00:02:00.653 align:start position:0% line:85%
CRAIGSLIST IS NO GOOD.

00:02:00.686 --> 00:02:04.123 size:81% position:41% line:91%
THEY WILL JUST DRESS YOUR
HOUSE UP AS A FURY AND RUB

00:02:04.156 --> 00:02:07.460 align:start position:0% line:91%
THEMSELVES ON IT. YOU
DON'T WANT THAT.

00:02:07.493 --> 00:02:14.233 align:start position:0% line:85%
(LAUGHTER)

00:02:14.266 --> 00:02:15.034 align:start position:0% line:91%
THAT JUST RESONATED
WAY TOO HOT.

00:02:15.067 --> 00:02:17.570 align:start position:0% line:91%
(LAUGHTER)
THE POINT IS, THE BACKLASH

00:02:17.603 --> 00:02:21.073 align:start position:0% line:91%
WAS SO INTENSE INDIANA
GOVERNOR MIKE PENCE HAD NO

00:02:21.106 --> 00:02:23.976 align:start position:0% line:91%
CHOICE BUT TO RESPOND VERY
STUPIDLY.

00:02:24.009 --> 00:02:26.345 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; DO YOU THINK IT SHOULD BE
LEGAL IN THE STATE OF

00:02:26.378 --> 00:02:30.750 align:start position:0% line:91%
INDIANA TO DISCRIMINATE
AGAINST GAYS OR LESBIANS?

00:02:30.783 --> 00:02:34.854 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; GEORGE, --

00:02:34.887 --> 00:02:36.022 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; IT'S A YES
OR NO QUESTION.

00:02:36.055 --> 00:02:38.457 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; LOOK COME ON, HOOSIERS DON'T
BELIEVE IN DISCRIMINATION.

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:41.761 size:78% position:39% line:91%
THERE ARE NO KINDER, MORE
GENEROUS, MORE WELCOMING,

00:02:41.794 --> 00:02:44.530 size:78% position:39% line:91%
MORE HOSPITABLE PEOPLE IN
AMERICA THAN IN THE 92

00:02:44.563 --> 00:02:46.265 align:start position:0% line:85%
COUNTIES OF INDIANA.

00:02:46.298 --> 00:02:48.000 size:78% position:39% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon: BUT FIRST OF ALL,
CAN WE STOP TALKING ABOUT

00:02:48.033 --> 00:02:54.307 size:81% position:41% line:91%
THE PEOPLE OF INDIANA LIKE
THEY'RE A LOST TRIBE FROM

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.008 align:start position:0% line:85%
NOSTALGIA-STAN.

00:02:56.041 --> 00:02:58.311 align:start position:0% line:91%
THE GOOD PEOPLE OF
INDIANA, THEIR MOTTO IS

00:02:58.344 --> 00:03:01.747 align:start position:0% line:91%
PLEASE AND THANK YOU AND THE
CURRENCY OF INDIANA IS A

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:02.715 align:start position:0% line:85%
HOMEMADE LEMON SQUARE.

00:03:02.748 --> 00:03:06.786 align:start position:0% line:91%
(LAUGHTER)
LET'S FACE IT, PEOPLE IN

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:09.755 align:start position:0% line:91%
INDIANA ARE NO NICER OR
[BLEEP] THAN PEOPLE ANYWHERE

00:03:09.788 --> 00:03:10.623 align:start position:0% line:85%
ELSE.

00:03:10.656 --> 00:03:13.526 align:start position:0% line:91%
EXCEPT PHILLY, THAT'S THE
WORST.

00:03:13.559 --> 00:03:15.795 align:start position:0% line:85%
AND D.C.

00:03:15.828 --> 00:03:20.032 align:start position:0% line:91%
ANY -- WELL REALLY IT'S ANY NL
EAST CITY. 

00:03:20.065 --> 00:03:21.667 align:start position:0% line:85%
METS RULE!

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:23.035 align:start position:0% line:91%
WAIT, WHAT ARE WE TALKING ABOUT
AGAIN?

00:03:23.068 --> 00:03:25.137 align:start position:0% line:85%
OH, INDIANA.

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:29.041 line:91%
ANYWAY, IT SEEMS LIKE GOVERNOR
MIKE PENCE'S UNWAIVERING BELIEF

00:03:29.074 --> 00:03:33.746 align:start position:0% line:91%
IN THE GOODNESS OF HOOSIERS DID
NEEDS SOME TWEAKING.

00:03:33.779 --> 00:03:36.849 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; MIKE PENCE APPROVING CHANGES
TO A CONTROVERSIAL NEW LAW.

00:03:36.882 --> 00:03:40.219 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; THE NEW LANGUAGE IN
INDIANA SPELLS OUT THE LAW DOES

00:03:40.252 --> 00:03:42.588 align:start position:0% line:91%
NOT AUTHORIZE A PROVIDER
TO REFUSE TO OFFER OR PROVIDE

00:03:42.621 --> 00:03:47.927 line:91%
SERVICES ON THE BASIS OF SEXUAL
ORIENTATION OR GENDER IDENTITY.

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:50.062 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Jon: ANY MORE.

00:03:50.095 --> 00:03:51.063 align:start position:0% line:91%
CAUSE IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO
DO.

00:03:51.096 --> 00:03:53.699 align:start position:0% line:85%
AND YOU CAUGHT US.

00:03:53.732 --> 00:03:56.102 size:81% position:41% line:91%
YOU KNOW I WOULD LIKE TO
BELIEVE THAT THE CHANGE IN

00:03:56.135 --> 00:04:00.873 align:start position:0% line:91%
LANGUAGE CAME VIA A MORAL
EPIPHANY BUT MY GUESS IS IT'S

00:04:00.906 --> 00:04:04.677 line:91%
MORE OF A AND I WOULD HAVE
GOTTEN AWAY WITH IT TOO IF IT

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:06.612 line:85%
WEREN'T FOR YOU MEDDLING KIDS.

00:04:06.645 --> 00:04:08.681 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; THE REASON THAT THOSE
CORPORATIONS PUT THE

00:04:08.714 --> 00:04:13.786 align:start position:0% line:91%
PRESSURE ON INDIANA AND
ARKANSAS WAS BECAUSE THE

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:16.322 align:start position:0% line:91%
MILITANT GAY COMMUNITY PUT THE
PRESSURE ON THEM.

00:04:16.355 --> 00:04:17.323 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Jon: SHUT UP.

00:04:17.356 --> 00:04:20.826 align:start position:0% line:91%
SO WHEN GAYS WANT EQUALITY
IT'S MILITANCY.

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:24.497 size:84% position:42% line:91%
AND WHEN CHRISTIANS WANT TO
DENY SERVICE, IT'S FREEDOM.

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:27.633 size:84% position:42% line:91%
SEE THOSE WHO ARE DEFENDING
THIS SORT OF LAW, GO VERY

00:04:27.666 --> 00:04:32.071 size:84% position:42% line:91%
FAR OUT OF THEIR WAY TO SAY
HOW IT'S NOT DISCRIMINATORY

00:04:32.104 --> 00:04:34.540 align:start position:0% line:91%
TOWARDS ANYBODY, ESPECIALLY
GAY PEOPLE.

00:04:34.573 --> 00:04:36.275 align:start position:0% line:91%
THEY'VE GOT NOTHING AGAINST
GAY PEOPLE.

00:04:36.308 --> 00:04:41.213 size:78% position:39% line:91%
AND THEY USE ANALOGIES TO
CLARIFY THEIR POSITION.

00:04:41.246 --> 00:04:45.117 align:start position:0% line:91%
WHICH ANALOGIES DO, JUST NOT
IN THE WAY THEY INTENDED.

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:51.524 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; IF YOU ARE A PRINT SHOP
AND YOU ARE A GAY MAN,

00:04:51.557 --> 00:04:57.063 align:start position:0% line:91%
SHOULD YOU BE FORCED TO
PRINT GOD HATES FAGS FOR THE

00:04:57.096 --> 00:04:58.497 size:84% position:42% line:85%
WESTBOROUGH BAPTIST CHURCH?

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:02.368 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; IF A KKK MEMBER COMES IN AND
SAYS I WANT A BIRTHDAY CAKE

00:05:02.401 --> 00:05:05.371 size:84% position:42% line:91%
MADE TO CELEBRATE THE BIRTH
OF THE KKK, SHOULD A BAKER

00:05:05.404 --> 00:05:08.574 size:84% position:42% line:91%
REGARDLESS OF THE COLOR OF
THEIR SKIN, BE ABLE TO SAY,

00:05:08.607 --> 00:05:11.110 align:start position:0% line:91%
I AM NOT GOING TO MAKE THAT
CAKE.

00:05:11.143 --> 00:05:13.546 size:75% position:38% line:91%
&gt;&gt; I WOULD THINK I WOULD
GIVE THE SAME RIGHT TO A

00:05:13.579 --> 00:05:20.419 size:84% position:42% line:91%
JEWISH BAKER TO NOT HAVE TO
PUT A SWASTIKA ON A BILL.

00:05:20.452 --> 00:05:24.357 size:81% position:41% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon: IT'S BEEN AWHILE
SINCE I'VE TAKEN THE SATs.

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:28.294 align:start position:0% line:91%
BUT I BELIEVE THE
FORMULATION AS YOU DEFEND

00:05:28.327 --> 00:05:30.529 align:start position:0% line:85%
YOURSELVES IS THIS.

00:05:30.562 --> 00:05:36.068 size:84% position:42% line:91%
THIS COUPLE IS TO CHRISTIAN
BUSINESS AS THESE FOLKS ARE

00:05:36.101 --> 00:05:37.670 align:start position:0% line:85%
TO EVERYONE ELSE.

00:05:37.703 --> 00:05:39.372 size:88% position:44% line:85%
IS THAT WHAT YOU ARE SAYING?

00:05:39.405 --> 00:05:41.674 size:78% position:39% line:91%
I'M NOT DISCRIMINATING, I
HAVE NOTHING AGAINST GAY

00:05:41.707 --> 00:05:45.845 size:88% position:44% line:91%
PEOPLE, I'M JUST SAYING, FOR
SOME CHRISTIANS, CATERING AN

00:05:45.878 --> 00:05:48.881 size:88% position:44% line:91%
ELDERLY LESBIAN WEDDING IS
LIKE MAKING A JEW SLOW DANCE

00:05:48.914 --> 00:05:49.715 align:start position:0% line:85%
WITH HITLER.

00:05:49.748 --> 00:05:51.350 align:start position:0% line:85%
THAT'S ALL I'M SAYING.

00:05:51.383 --> 00:05:56.689 align:start position:0% line:85%
(LAUGHTER)

00:05:56.722 --> 00:05:58.424 line:85%
DO YOU SEE HOW [BLEEP] THAT IS?

00:05:58.457 --> 00:06:03.829 size:81% position:41% line:91%
BASICALLY YOU SEE PEOPLE
CELEBRATING LOVE AS A HATE

00:06:03.862 --> 00:06:04.630 align:start position:0% line:85%
GROUP.

00:06:04.663 --> 00:06:07.166 align:start position:0% line:91%
ALTHOUGH, THERE IS GOOD
NEWS.

00:06:07.199 --> 00:06:11.103 size:84% position:42% line:91%
&gt;&gt; IT REMAINS LEGAL IN MOST
OF INDIANA TO FIRE SOMEONE

00:06:11.136 --> 00:06:13.873 align:start position:0% line:85%
BECAUSE THEY'RE GAY.

00:06:13.906 --> 00:06:14.740 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Jon: YES!

00:06:14.773 --> 00:06:16.542 align:start position:0% line:91%
SO THE LESSON HERE IS
CLEAR.

00:06:16.575 --> 00:06:21.781 size:81% position:41% line:91%
YOU ARE IN INDIANA AND YOU
GET FIRED FOR BEING GAY,

00:06:21.814 --> 00:06:24.747 align:start position:0% line:91%
MAKE THOSE MOTHER [BLEEP]
CATER YOUR WEDDING.
