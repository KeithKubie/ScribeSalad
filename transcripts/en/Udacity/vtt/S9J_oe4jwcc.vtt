00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:02.930
Just like we want compatible attributes for

00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:04.960
a persona, we also want use cases that

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:08.000
make sense with our persona. So let's go

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.730
over two use cases for Dorm Room Debbie.

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:15.410
So remember, a use case is the how, when and where, Debbie would use our pizza

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:18.100
application to order pizza. So one example might

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:20.013
be, she's going to order pizza at 4 am.

00:00:20.013 --> 00:00:20.850
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:22.760
&gt;&gt; Another example would be, that she might

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:25.340
order a big group order with her friends.

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:28.740
So these two use cases are consistent with Dorm Room Debbie's persona. Can you

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.300
come up with another use case that would make sense for Dorm Room Debbie?
