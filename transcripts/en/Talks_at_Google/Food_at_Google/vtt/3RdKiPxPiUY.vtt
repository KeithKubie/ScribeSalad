CHRIS YING: My
name is Chris Ying.

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:06.920
I'm the editor in chief of a
magazine called "Lucky Peach."

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:08.950
And our very
esteemed guest today

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:13.890
is Alex Atala from Brazil,
the chef of D.O.M. and Dalva e

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:16.230
Dito.

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.410
And my job, for
whatever reason, I've

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:22.399
been fortunate enough
to do a lot of traveling

00:00:22.399 --> 00:00:23.440
the last couple of years.

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:28.000
And one of the preeminent
experiences of my travels

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.880
was going to Sao Paulo and
eating at D.O.M. last summer.

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.460
And it was one of these
revelatory meals where

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:36.260
there are flavors I
had never had before.

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.310
You get used to
eating things, and you

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:41.391
see different combinations
at different restaurants.

00:00:41.391 --> 00:00:43.140
But it's really rare
that you go somewhere

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.931
and there are things
that are on your plate

00:00:44.931 --> 00:00:48.010
that you've never experienced,
and flavors you've never

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:52.420
experienced, and textures and
ideas that are wholly new.

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:54.330
You start to think
of food as one thing.

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:58.590
So I think that's what you've
tried to capture in this book

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.660
today.

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.130
For those people who haven't
eaten at the restaurants,

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:06.030
or might not eat at the
restaurants at any time soon,

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.556
can you talk a
little bit about what

00:01:08.556 --> 00:01:10.680
the experience of eating
at D.O.M. is, what you try

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.710
to convey?

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:15.900
ALEX ATALA: Brazil
cuisine abroad, it

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.140
is a huge question
for everybody.

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:24.780
Nobody knows Brazilian cuisine.

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.750
And for us, it's also
difficult to express.

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:32.940
So talking about
Brazilian cuisine

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:36.620
is difficult, as difficult as
talking about American cuisine.

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:39.785
What is American cuisine?

00:01:39.785 --> 00:01:40.410
It's difficult.

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:42.660
It's not just burgers.

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:44.560
We have the soul.

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:49.840
You guys have amazing diversity.

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:54.762
You guys are a melting
pot of cultures.

00:01:54.762 --> 00:01:57.130
And Brazil is almost
the same thing,

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:59.510
but we have something more.

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:06.070
We have a place which nobody
had-- or the gastronomy didn't

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:12.010
have [INAUDIBLE], and you
know this, which is Amazonas.

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:19.250
This is a new
frontier for flavor.

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:23.920
Unfortunately, in our
Brazilian culture, and maybe

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:29.570
all cultures, we always have
been looking local people,

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:34.980
indigenous people as
a primitive culture,

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:39.990
and we didn't make lots
of attention on it.

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:47.000
Even if they have a very
primitive or rustic cuisine

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:53.750
and culture, I should tell you
guys that that simplicity, that

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:59.200
rusticity has been
[INAUDIBLE] over generations.

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:06.580
There's lots of knowledge,
and lots of new ways

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:09.840
to understand our culture.

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:10.890
There's few differences.

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:18.040
I don't know if you know,
guys, but I was maybe

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:21.210
the first chef in
the fine dining world

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:28.540
to put one ant in a
dish, in a recipe.

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:31.350
Then Scott Conant
took the same idea,

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:36.430
and helped me to
spread this overseas.

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:40.320
Let me tell you my first
experience with ants.

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:42.570
I went to Amazonas.

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:49.930
And one anthropologist-- I
used to work in collaboration

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:54.040
with them-- told me, Alex, you
might should meet Dona Brazi.

00:03:54.040 --> 00:04:00.190
And Dona Brazi is the local
chef in a tiny, tiny village.

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:02.440
And she didn't
have a restaurant.

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:07.090
She sells food on
the street market.

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:09.120
And we went in there.

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:14.160
And she brings me a
beautiful dark sauce

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:18.320
with lots of ants inside,
and said, taste it.

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:27.690
It's tough to eat ants,
big ants, even more.

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:29.290
We didn't learn this.

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:37.280
But my mouth is my most
accurate tool for my profession.

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:38.670
So I might should taste it.

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:41.780
I might should challenge
my mental block,

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:44.840
or my cultural block,
and taste that.

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:45.930
And I tasted it.

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:48.990
And I tasted the sauce,
and beautiful aroma

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:51.470
of lemongrass and ginger.

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:54.470
I became so impressed, and I
said, Dona Brazi, what kind

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:56.050
of herb did you put in there?

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:58.450
And I ask because we didn't
have lemongrass and ginger

00:04:58.450 --> 00:04:59.695
in Amazonas culture.

00:04:59.695 --> 00:05:00.990
And she said ants.

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:02.450
And I said, OK, I
can see the ants.

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:03.190
It's clear.

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:04.810
But which herb?

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:06.010
And she said ants.

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:07.800
And I tried to
remake the question.

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:09.200
And she said, stop.

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:10.280
Taste the ants.

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:15.460
And I grabbed one ant and I put
in my mouth, and this huge wave

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:20.810
of aroma and flavor, full of
ginger and lemongrass-- wow.

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:28.140
And I said, wow,
I might use this.

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:32.670
So I decided to take a
few ants to my restaurant

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:34.170
and start using there.

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:37.615
And also in my next
trip, I had planned

00:05:37.615 --> 00:05:41.380
to bring with me some
ginger and lemongrass.

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:42.405
And I did it.

00:05:42.405 --> 00:05:44.220
And I made almost
the same sauce,

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:47.730
and I invited Dona
Brazi to taste it.

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:51.920
And she was expecting
something new

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:55.830
from a chef who comes from
Sao Paulo, from the big city.

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:57.670
And I gave to her,
and she tasted it.

00:05:57.670 --> 00:05:59.260
It tasted like ants.

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:05.160
First thing, first very
important thing-- for us,

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:08.610
ants taste as
lemongrass and ginger.

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:11.480
From them, lemongrass
and ginger taste

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:17.940
as an ant-- different points
of view, different cultures.

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:21.970
And then I went back to my
restaurant with my ants,

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:26.630
almost ashamed to use
ants in my restaurant.

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:33.790
So I didn't have self confidence
enough to put one entire ant,

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:39.820
and make my customer,
which is paying nice money,

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:42.740
to taste the ants.

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:45.790
So I must figure out one way.

00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:51.220
So I made powder-- ants
powder, beautiful, black--

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:55.160
and I put it over
a scampi risotto.

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:58.370
And nobody couldn't believe
that this big, nice flavor

00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:00.360
comes from the ants.

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:02.930
So they were looking
for the ants.

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:04.650
And they said, it's
beautiful, but I

00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:06.802
can't find the
taste of the ants.

00:07:06.802 --> 00:07:08.260
I said, no, no it's
the lemongrass.

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:12.010
They said, no, no, no, the ants.

00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:17.800
I decided to make a small
pineapple, almost frozen, very,

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:22.710
very cold, with one ant,
and give to the customer,

00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:25.440
and prove this challenge.

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:27.830
It's just one ant.

00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:28.690
It's just one.

00:07:28.690 --> 00:07:32.220
People can face this.

00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:38.680
And it's fun when you
see the expressions.

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:40.720
It's fun, because
everybody looks

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:42.770
and doesn't feel comfortable.

00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:45.400
It is a big ant.

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:49.020
And then people must take
with their hands and bite.

00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:57.020
And of course, the first flavor
that comes is the pineapple.

00:07:57.020 --> 00:08:02.550
And people start to bite,
and they can't believe.

00:08:02.550 --> 00:08:04.860
And the reactions
are so profound.

00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:09.990
And we are talking
now about flavor.

00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:13.905
We are talking about
emotions, how much

00:08:13.905 --> 00:08:19.670
surprise or good feelings
one food can bring for us.

00:08:24.190 --> 00:08:29.360
| or palette, is something that
we develop during the years.

00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:35.640
Kids do not like alcohol,
or bitter taste, or spicy.

00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:40.840
We learned how to
appreciate those flavors.

00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:44.540
When I was a tiny, tiny
boy, my grandmother

00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:49.140
used to make a beautiful
corn cake for me.

00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:57.170
And that corn cake for
me was the best flavor,

00:08:57.170 --> 00:09:01.150
or my first connection
with a good flavor.

00:09:01.150 --> 00:09:03.035
And I really became-- wow.

00:09:07.046 --> 00:09:12.340
I grew up, and we
moved to another city.

00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:14.590
So I lost a little
bit the connection,

00:09:14.590 --> 00:09:19.280
my daily connection with
my family, or my grandma.

00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:27.110
And I grew up with always that
amazing flavor in my memory.

00:09:27.110 --> 00:09:33.140
And a few years later, I could
have the possibility of taste

00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:37.800
again the same
beautiful corn cake

00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:39.930
that my grandma used to make.

00:09:39.930 --> 00:09:44.830
And I tasted it, and
it wasn't so good.

00:09:44.830 --> 00:09:46.105
My flavor was developed.

00:09:46.105 --> 00:09:48.540
I was not a tiny boy.

00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:53.060
But until today, when I taste
something really surprising,

00:09:53.060 --> 00:09:57.470
I still think, this
is as good as the corn

00:09:57.470 --> 00:09:58.960
cake of my grandmother.

00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:02.260
We are not talking about
flavor, but how much emotions

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:04.000
a new flavor can bring for you.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.190
So I try to figure out
this, both in my recipes,

00:10:08.190 --> 00:10:12.540
just because I didn't
work with common flavors.

00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:14.470
I work with new flavors.

00:10:14.470 --> 00:10:22.840
And the best way to
challenge, I guess,

00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:25.800
should taste those
new flavor might

00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:27.200
be in a very comfortable way.

00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:31.600
We are chefs.

00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:35.710
Our first commitment,
it's give pleasure

00:10:35.710 --> 00:10:38.900
to people who come
to our restaurant.

00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:42.240
People don't go to
restaurants for suffering.

00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:45.990
People go to restaurants
for enjoying.

00:10:45.990 --> 00:10:53.320
But we can try to give
a few more sensations.

00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:57.670
So this is mainly
the way that we work.

00:10:57.670 --> 00:11:00.770
CHRIS YING: I think that's
a really perfect description

00:11:00.770 --> 00:11:03.400
of what it is to eat at
D.O.M. You're challenged,

00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:06.147
but I've been to so many meals
that are like suffering, where

00:11:06.147 --> 00:11:07.730
trying to teach you
something, and you

00:11:07.730 --> 00:11:09.180
feel like they're slapping
you on the wrist when

00:11:09.180 --> 00:11:10.513
you don't understand right away.

00:11:10.513 --> 00:11:12.590
But D.O.M. is
pleasurable, and you're

00:11:12.590 --> 00:11:16.430
educating people and educating
yourself at the same time.

00:11:16.430 --> 00:11:19.110
But that's not
necessarily the reason

00:11:19.110 --> 00:11:22.460
why Alex is one of
"Time" magazine's

00:11:22.460 --> 00:11:24.180
most 100 influential
people, whatnot,

00:11:24.180 --> 00:11:27.220
why he's built up this
reputation around the world.

00:11:27.220 --> 00:11:30.880
D.O.M. And you personally
have a bigger mission

00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:32.960
than just putting
food on the plate.

00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:35.170
You have things are
more important to you

00:11:35.170 --> 00:11:37.180
than just serving dinner.

00:11:37.180 --> 00:11:40.212
Do you want to talk about
some of those things?

00:11:40.212 --> 00:11:41.920
ALEX ATALA: Well,
let's take this subject

00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:46.530
in two different ways.

00:11:46.530 --> 00:11:51.900
One is my message
from Brazilian people.

00:11:51.900 --> 00:11:55.170
Those ingredients
that I use and you

00:11:55.170 --> 00:12:02.630
can find in my book, lots and
lots and lots of Brazilians

00:12:02.630 --> 00:12:06.510
never ever tasted before.

00:12:06.510 --> 00:12:09.450
Even Brazilians don't know.

00:12:09.450 --> 00:12:14.040
So my first compromise is
show to Brazilian people

00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:19.060
that Brazilian cuisine
is a possible dream.

00:12:19.060 --> 00:12:24.610
And we have lots much
more than feijoada,

00:12:24.610 --> 00:12:26.500
or barbecue, or picanha.

00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:31.010
I love it, but as you guys
in America have burgers,

00:12:31.010 --> 00:12:35.695
and it's beautiful, but
it's not whole America.

00:12:35.695 --> 00:12:36.560
We have feijoada.

00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:39.880
We have rodizio or picanha.

00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:42.510
But this is not all
Brazilian cuisine.

00:12:42.510 --> 00:12:44.690
And people [INAUDIBLE]
me this attention.

00:12:44.690 --> 00:12:52.520
As a colonized country,
even me, we always

00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:58.040
have more eyes for
other cultures.

00:12:58.040 --> 00:13:02.540
We never look at our
culture with pride.

00:13:02.540 --> 00:13:05.030
I don't know why
Brazilian always

00:13:05.030 --> 00:13:09.550
have been looking at our local
culture as something poor.

00:13:09.550 --> 00:13:12.710
And sometimes I became
mad with Brazilians

00:13:12.710 --> 00:13:17.320
because we have fine dining,
and we have street food.

00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:19.710
Street food in Brazil has
been almost forbidden.

00:13:19.710 --> 00:13:24.140
And we are fighting
to rescue this.

00:13:24.140 --> 00:13:29.920
And also something that
we call boteco-- boteco

00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:37.530
is finger food that
we have just to drink.

00:13:37.530 --> 00:13:39.130
And it's amazing.

00:13:39.130 --> 00:13:43.420
But people who went to
boteco used to say this

00:13:43.420 --> 00:13:44.420
is not high gastronomy.

00:13:44.420 --> 00:13:46.660
It's low gastronomy.

00:13:46.660 --> 00:13:52.922
And I became-- you got it.

00:13:52.922 --> 00:13:55.890
[LAUGHS] i became mad with this.

00:13:55.890 --> 00:13:57.230
Why?

00:13:57.230 --> 00:14:00.660
Because it's cheap, it's low?

00:14:00.660 --> 00:14:04.650
What do you fucking
mean, high gastronomy?

00:14:04.650 --> 00:14:09.350
High gastronomy is not to
work with fancy ingredients.

00:14:09.350 --> 00:14:11.880
It is to put one
ingredient or one recipe

00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:13.550
in their best moment.

00:14:13.550 --> 00:14:17.360
And this is easy to understand.

00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:21.620
Let's make a supposition here.

00:14:21.620 --> 00:14:24.810
You Americans love
burgers and hot dogs.

00:14:24.810 --> 00:14:29.100
And everybody knows where is
the best hot dog or the best

00:14:29.100 --> 00:14:31.580
burger.

00:14:31.580 --> 00:14:35.710
And those places
are very busy, ever.

00:14:35.710 --> 00:14:38.440
A sushi man in Japan
is an honorable man.

00:14:41.150 --> 00:14:48.260
His honorability is the
customer who goes to them.

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:50.580
He makes sushi for
people who have

00:14:50.580 --> 00:14:54.290
been eating sushi
their entire lives.

00:14:54.290 --> 00:14:56.930
And they know this is the guy.

00:14:59.980 --> 00:15:02.120
Creativity is not
to do something

00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:03.850
that nobody did before.

00:15:03.850 --> 00:15:08.280
It's to do something that
everybody does, better,

00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:10.660
surprisingly.

00:15:10.660 --> 00:15:11.420
This is the way.

00:15:14.060 --> 00:15:19.310
People really want to
square high gastronomy

00:15:19.310 --> 00:15:24.500
in truffles, foie gras,
small dishes, lots of money.

00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:25.710
Come on.

00:15:25.710 --> 00:15:27.460
Come on.

00:15:27.460 --> 00:15:31.600
This is a fucking old idea.

00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:32.690
That's true.

00:15:32.690 --> 00:15:34.860
I'm not kidding.

00:15:34.860 --> 00:15:38.260
I have much more pleasure
sometimes those mornings

00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:43.540
I went to the pier,
and I ate a sandwich

00:15:43.540 --> 00:15:47.792
with ramp and fried eggs.

00:15:47.792 --> 00:15:50.320
And that was good.

00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:52.320
That was really good.

00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:56.100
That brings me surprise.

00:15:56.100 --> 00:15:59.520
I ate one egg in
an unexpected way.

00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:02.730
There is something new
happens in the world.

00:16:02.730 --> 00:16:06.030
You guys from Google know this.

00:16:06.030 --> 00:16:09.730
Until when we are going
to think that cuisine

00:16:09.730 --> 00:16:12.670
is only for rich people?

00:16:12.670 --> 00:16:18.020
Cuisine is human,
as human as sex is.

00:16:18.020 --> 00:16:19.700
It's pleasure.

00:16:19.700 --> 00:16:22.610
It's to share.

00:16:22.610 --> 00:16:24.000
Come on.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:25.630
Food is much more.

00:16:25.630 --> 00:16:27.020
Food is culture.

00:16:27.020 --> 00:16:30.220
We should rethink about
our relation with food.

00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:37.990
Talking about now about
review our concept.

00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:47.060
One month ago, a little bit
more, Chris was with me.

00:16:47.060 --> 00:16:50.880
We went to MAD food
camp in Copenhagen.

00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:56.630
Rene Redzepi, our friend, runs
one of the best and interesting

00:16:56.630 --> 00:17:00.000
some food congresses
in the world.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.050
I will try to explain this.

00:17:02.050 --> 00:17:06.980
All of the food congresses,
you have a very friendly chef

00:17:06.980 --> 00:17:09.700
with his beautiful
knife, his nice pants,

00:17:09.700 --> 00:17:12.339
animating fucking recipes.

00:17:12.339 --> 00:17:13.879
This is a circus.

00:17:13.879 --> 00:17:14.379
Sorry.

00:17:17.028 --> 00:17:18.319
You can see this on television.

00:17:18.319 --> 00:17:20.784
You don't need to
go to a congress.

00:17:20.784 --> 00:17:21.700
It's usually the same.

00:17:24.470 --> 00:17:25.890
It didn't taste as well.

00:17:25.890 --> 00:17:27.630
Television doesn't taste.

00:17:27.630 --> 00:17:28.572
Congress didn't taste.

00:17:28.572 --> 00:17:30.405
That's the reason why
you go to restaurants.

00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:39.260
MAD food camp, it
is a huge panel

00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:45.040
of the big picture of cuisine,
of food, not only the food

00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:46.040
chain, but the food web.

00:17:48.670 --> 00:17:51.570
Food this is a cross line
between nature and culture.

00:17:54.550 --> 00:18:01.010
Food is the main track of
research of all human science.

00:18:01.010 --> 00:18:05.570
And Rene put all those
beautiful ideas together.

00:18:05.570 --> 00:18:12.340
So he invited me-- I don't
know why-- to MAD food camp,

00:18:12.340 --> 00:18:18.500
and I wear this shirt with
this beautiful message.

00:18:18.500 --> 00:18:25.240
And I showed very strong videos.

00:18:25.240 --> 00:18:31.230
Rene has read one text which
I have in my book about death.

00:18:31.230 --> 00:18:36.550
And I enter on the stage,
and I kill a chicken.

00:18:36.550 --> 00:18:39.440
I didn't say nothing.

00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:40.900
And everybody became so choked.

00:18:44.310 --> 00:18:49.140
Instead of killing a chicken,
if I had killed a fish,

00:18:49.140 --> 00:18:52.780
maybe the message
would be not so deep.

00:18:52.780 --> 00:18:56.407
If you go to a
fishmonger, you can

00:18:56.407 --> 00:19:00.390
see lobster, crabs,
beautiful fish.

00:19:00.390 --> 00:19:02.640
This is beautiful for our eyes.

00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:06.190
But if you go to a butcher shop
and you see calves, chicken,

00:19:06.190 --> 00:19:10.140
lambs, pigs, that is not good.

00:19:10.140 --> 00:19:12.850
It's not comfortable.

00:19:12.850 --> 00:19:15.390
Why?

00:19:15.390 --> 00:19:19.700
For myself, the
only reason is fish

00:19:19.700 --> 00:19:21.750
didn't change their expression.

00:19:21.750 --> 00:19:24.322
He keeps living.

00:19:24.322 --> 00:19:26.770
Yeah.

00:19:26.770 --> 00:19:29.270
The fish didn't
have expressions.

00:19:29.270 --> 00:19:35.620
They didn't die for our eye,
our cultural interpretation

00:19:35.620 --> 00:19:38.100
of death.

00:19:38.100 --> 00:19:42.160
I'm a huge fan of
vegetarianism, a huge fan.

00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:46.830
Even in my cookbook, I made
texts about vegetarianism.

00:19:46.830 --> 00:19:49.840
In my restaurant, last
five years or even more,

00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:53.680
I have a vegetarian taste menu.

00:19:53.680 --> 00:19:57.790
But sometimes, people
said, I'm vegetarian

00:19:57.790 --> 00:20:02.140
because I have compassion of
my da da da da, poor animals.

00:20:02.140 --> 00:20:04.846
Fuck you.

00:20:04.846 --> 00:20:06.330
Fuck you.

00:20:06.330 --> 00:20:08.240
Death happens.

00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:11.620
I might should tell you
guys, go to Amazonas,

00:20:11.620 --> 00:20:17.810
and you'll see how much land has
been deforested to feed people.

00:20:17.810 --> 00:20:19.740
Deforestation
didn't kill animals.

00:20:19.740 --> 00:20:23.830
It sterilized one
entire ecosystem.

00:20:23.830 --> 00:20:27.830
So if you are this
type of vegetarian,

00:20:27.830 --> 00:20:32.360
please come to visit Amazonas.

00:20:32.360 --> 00:20:35.460
Come to see what it
means green deserts.

00:20:35.460 --> 00:20:41.070
There's no lives inside of
that-- green fields sterile.

00:20:44.120 --> 00:20:48.010
Brazil nowadays is
the worst, the leader

00:20:48.010 --> 00:20:51.070
of chemical emission
in agriculture.

00:20:51.070 --> 00:20:52.775
The chemicals go from somewhere.

00:20:56.030 --> 00:20:58.930
Our relation with food
might be reviewed.

00:21:02.850 --> 00:21:08.510
This is a bad way to
talk about a review.

00:21:08.510 --> 00:21:10.330
But there's other possibilities.

00:21:15.490 --> 00:21:18.930
My relation with
those ingredients,

00:21:18.930 --> 00:21:25.575
with Brazilian ingredients, it
started in the very beginning,

00:21:25.575 --> 00:21:29.310
or maybe a few years before,
[? O Pendon, ?] which

00:21:29.310 --> 00:21:32.260
has 14 years already.

00:21:32.260 --> 00:21:34.400
I decided to use
Brazilian ingredients,

00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:37.435
but those Brazilian ingredients
weren't on the market.

00:21:41.420 --> 00:21:44.660
So I started to call
friends and local people,

00:21:44.660 --> 00:21:47.400
and trying to connect
everybody to have

00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:50.140
that beautiful ingredient
in my restaurant.

00:21:50.140 --> 00:21:51.910
In the Brazilian
market, I could only

00:21:51.910 --> 00:21:57.850
find industrial level
of medium quality

00:21:57.850 --> 00:22:01.310
of Brazilian ingredients.

00:22:01.310 --> 00:22:07.705
After 14, 15 years, this
relation became too big, too,

00:22:07.705 --> 00:22:09.330
too big.

00:22:09.330 --> 00:22:11.770
So I decided to
make a foundation

00:22:11.770 --> 00:22:18.070
because that relation didn't
fit anymore into a restaurant.

00:22:18.070 --> 00:22:20.240
And I realized that
as a chef, I was not

00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:23.780
able to handle that situation.

00:22:23.780 --> 00:22:26.960
And I will try to tell
to you guys the day

00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:33.240
that I realized that I was
not able to play that game.

00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:42.070
12 years ago-- well, let's
go a little bit back,

00:22:42.070 --> 00:22:47.420
when I had been trained
to be a chef in Europe.

00:22:47.420 --> 00:22:50.810
And lots of good
chefs in Europe used

00:22:50.810 --> 00:22:55.490
to plant their own
vegetables, their own herbs.

00:22:55.490 --> 00:22:58.660
And this is so nice.

00:22:58.660 --> 00:22:59.590
I agree with that.

00:22:59.590 --> 00:23:01.100
I love that idea.

00:23:01.100 --> 00:23:04.860
So as a trained
chef, I learned you

00:23:04.860 --> 00:23:10.220
think you can raise
your own ingredients.

00:23:10.220 --> 00:23:16.450
And you can also understand
that the most important moment

00:23:16.450 --> 00:23:21.390
for a chef is not the
service when the guest comes.

00:23:21.390 --> 00:23:25.200
It is the prep, what
we call mise en place.

00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:30.370
If you didn't have a very
well done and organized mise

00:23:30.370 --> 00:23:34.090
en place, you're going to
lose in between the service,

00:23:34.090 --> 00:23:36.520
lose yourself.

00:23:36.520 --> 00:23:42.340
12 years ago, I bought
a huge area in Amazonas.

00:23:42.340 --> 00:23:45.730
The ex-owner in a small
community, local community,

00:23:45.730 --> 00:23:50.530
used to fight because part
of the area, both of them

00:23:50.530 --> 00:23:54.360
believed they owned it.

00:23:54.360 --> 00:23:56.800
When I bought the area,
I bought the problem.

00:23:56.800 --> 00:24:01.050
So I decided to
solve the problem.

00:24:01.050 --> 00:24:02.360
And I went in there.

00:24:02.360 --> 00:24:07.940
I had a one entire afternoon
conversation with the natives.

00:24:07.940 --> 00:24:11.530
And in the end, I made a
very simple proposition.

00:24:11.530 --> 00:24:15.670
I said to them, which
part of the area

00:24:15.670 --> 00:24:16.970
you believe it is yours?

00:24:16.970 --> 00:24:18.370
They said, there, there, there.

00:24:18.370 --> 00:24:23.240
I said, OK, go to the
city, pay the tax,

00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:27.150
and I will never, ever--
and nobody will never, ever

00:24:27.150 --> 00:24:28.330
touch your lands.

00:24:28.330 --> 00:24:31.220
And they made it.

00:24:31.220 --> 00:24:33.695
And I became so proud.

00:24:33.695 --> 00:24:40.410
I started to feel myself the
smartest, coolest, intelligent,

00:24:40.410 --> 00:24:47.970
near to God, really
near, almost beside him.

00:24:47.970 --> 00:24:51.000
And I couldn't play with this.

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:54.770
That area in Amazonas
is a very poor area,

00:24:54.770 --> 00:24:57.560
but is not a miserable area.

00:24:57.560 --> 00:25:01.850
That community, they used
to have lots of kids.

00:25:01.850 --> 00:25:05.670
It was clear that even
if they have food,

00:25:05.670 --> 00:25:08.530
maybe kids were underfed.

00:25:08.530 --> 00:25:10.984
So I decided to
send food to them.

00:25:10.984 --> 00:25:11.900
And I started to send.

00:25:14.860 --> 00:25:18.310
A few months later,
I went to this area.

00:25:18.310 --> 00:25:20.870
To enter in my
area, I might should

00:25:20.870 --> 00:25:26.630
cross the local
community in the area.

00:25:26.630 --> 00:25:29.480
And when I passed
by there, there

00:25:29.480 --> 00:25:35.060
were cans and plastic
bags everywhere.

00:25:35.060 --> 00:25:37.060
Duh, you smart guy.

00:25:37.060 --> 00:25:39.290
Stop the car.

00:25:39.290 --> 00:25:44.090
I started to explain to them
that they couldn't do this.

00:25:44.090 --> 00:25:46.070
It's awful.

00:25:46.070 --> 00:25:47.730
You live in Amazonas.

00:25:47.730 --> 00:25:53.780
A can, a plastic
bag, that's not good.

00:25:53.780 --> 00:25:55.250
And they didn't understand.

00:25:55.250 --> 00:25:58.730
They became upset with me.

00:25:58.730 --> 00:26:02.280
So the temperature
started to rise up,

00:26:02.280 --> 00:26:05.730
and I became not comfortable.

00:26:05.730 --> 00:26:08.910
And one of the oldest men
faced me and said, Alex,

00:26:08.910 --> 00:26:13.810
it's your fault.

00:26:13.810 --> 00:26:16.070
I said, sir, sorry.

00:26:16.070 --> 00:26:19.750
I started to send food for
your grandchildren, which

00:26:19.750 --> 00:26:24.460
have almost the same age
that your youngest son,

00:26:24.460 --> 00:26:27.210
and you try to blame me.

00:26:27.210 --> 00:26:31.890
And he answered
almost like this.

00:26:31.890 --> 00:26:34.420
Packaging of fruits is the skin.

00:26:34.420 --> 00:26:37.230
Packaging of fish is the scales.

00:26:37.230 --> 00:26:39.530
Packaging of one animal is fur.

00:26:39.530 --> 00:26:41.390
I throw away.

00:26:41.390 --> 00:26:47.080
At the first moment, the
skin looks very violent.

00:26:47.080 --> 00:26:53.250
But who was sending the cans
and the plastic bags to them?

00:26:53.250 --> 00:26:58.200
That was the day that I
realized that maybe as a chef,

00:26:58.200 --> 00:27:05.840
I can handle the food
chain, but not the food web.

00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:13.810
That was the day that
I realized that this

00:27:13.810 --> 00:27:20.580
is an interdisciplinary
thing, and I

00:27:20.580 --> 00:27:24.980
might should learn and be
supported by anthropologists,

00:27:24.980 --> 00:27:27.950
by sociologists, by
different disciplines.

00:27:33.070 --> 00:27:38.740
One year ago, a little bit more,
I made public the institute

00:27:38.740 --> 00:27:42.610
which the only goal
that we can try to do

00:27:42.610 --> 00:27:47.970
is try to organize
this food chain,

00:27:47.970 --> 00:27:55.440
and try to do not cross the
line for the food web, which

00:27:55.440 --> 00:27:57.720
is a human web.

00:27:57.720 --> 00:28:00.760
A few days ago, a
journalist has asked me,

00:28:00.760 --> 00:28:04.530
why use ants if they have a
lemongrass and ginger taste?

00:28:07.150 --> 00:28:09.940
Why not?

00:28:09.940 --> 00:28:12.950
Until when we are going
to still believe that

00:28:12.950 --> 00:28:15.950
our culture is superior
than the other?

00:28:18.510 --> 00:28:23.540
Until when we are
going to believe that

00:28:23.540 --> 00:28:24.760
we know more than the others?

00:28:27.950 --> 00:28:33.640
In Portuguese, we have a very
nice expression which says,

00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:37.910
if to speak was
better than listening,

00:28:37.910 --> 00:28:41.480
we would be born with
two mouths and a one ear.

00:28:44.050 --> 00:28:46.150
We might should understand them.

00:28:49.160 --> 00:28:51.630
It is primitive, it is
simple, it is rustic.

00:28:51.630 --> 00:28:53.520
Yes, it is.

00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:55.250
Maybe it's not so complex.

00:28:55.250 --> 00:28:57.060
Yes, it isn't.

00:28:57.060 --> 00:28:59.970
But it's deep.

00:28:59.970 --> 00:29:03.335
They have been living in
Amazonas for generations.

00:29:06.130 --> 00:29:11.180
They didn't make
big damages in there

00:29:11.180 --> 00:29:16.220
as we made in the last 50 years.

00:29:16.220 --> 00:29:27.240
50 years is just because it
is the years which agriculture

00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:31.820
has really entered in
Amazonas area, even less.

00:29:31.820 --> 00:29:35.990
But again, we can
learn with them.

00:29:35.990 --> 00:29:38.140
We might respect them.

00:29:38.140 --> 00:29:45.210
We can try to defend the nature.

00:29:49.390 --> 00:29:52.080
Everybody knows when we talk
about natural conservation

00:29:52.080 --> 00:29:58.820
that we might should protect
rivers, sea, lands, forests.

00:29:58.820 --> 00:30:01.090
But we can forget
a natural being

00:30:01.090 --> 00:30:03.830
which is the human
being who lives

00:30:03.830 --> 00:30:08.740
inside or near the forest,
the lands, the sea.

00:30:12.030 --> 00:30:14.890
We honor the nature.

00:30:14.890 --> 00:30:18.756
We are just part of the nature.

00:30:18.756 --> 00:30:22.210
CHRIS YING: No, I think that one
of the most interesting things

00:30:22.210 --> 00:30:24.480
you've said and you
cover in this book

00:30:24.480 --> 00:30:28.379
is that idea that cuisine is
the connection between nature

00:30:28.379 --> 00:30:30.170
and culture, and that's
something that sort

00:30:30.170 --> 00:30:33.310
of transcends just
eating at the restaurant.

00:30:33.310 --> 00:30:36.720
And what you're trying
to do in Amazonas

00:30:36.720 --> 00:30:40.640
is using cuisine as
this tool for change.

00:30:40.640 --> 00:30:43.160
And it's a really powerful tool
that I think a lot of chefs

00:30:43.160 --> 00:30:45.380
haven't quite realized
how powerful it

00:30:45.380 --> 00:30:49.276
is to achieve positive things.

00:30:49.276 --> 00:30:50.900
I'm going to ask you
one more question,

00:30:50.900 --> 00:30:54.580
and then if anybody else has
any questions, you can chime in.

00:30:54.580 --> 00:30:57.825
So the book is very specific
to these ingredients that

00:30:57.825 --> 00:31:03.415
are Brazilian, and you have to
be there with these ingredients

00:31:03.415 --> 00:31:08.200
to understand them and get
the full effect of the book.

00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:11.560
So what do you want to try to
achieve this book for readers

00:31:11.560 --> 00:31:14.240
in America, readers in
Europe who aren't in Brazil?

00:31:14.240 --> 00:31:15.550
What can they take from it?

00:31:15.550 --> 00:31:20.060
What is the message
underlying the Brazilian part?

00:31:20.060 --> 00:31:21.480
ALEX ATALA: Well,
first of all, I

00:31:21.480 --> 00:31:22.930
tried to show
people that we have

00:31:22.930 --> 00:31:28.270
much more to show in the
sense of ingredients.

00:31:28.270 --> 00:31:35.110
If Spain, Italy, France, Japan,
are referenced as gastronomy,

00:31:35.110 --> 00:31:39.580
it's not because they have only
ingredients and one good chef.

00:31:39.580 --> 00:31:43.015
They have lots of ingredients
and lots of good chefs.

00:31:43.015 --> 00:31:46.370
We have nowadays
amazing, really amazing

00:31:46.370 --> 00:31:49.060
new generation of
chefs coming up,

00:31:49.060 --> 00:31:52.240
and they might be supported.

00:31:52.240 --> 00:31:55.940
And they might
believe in their own.

00:31:55.940 --> 00:31:58.590
And they might have eyes
for their own culture.

00:31:58.590 --> 00:32:06.400
So this is one of the messages
of the cookbook, again, trying

00:32:06.400 --> 00:32:10.185
to make people believe
that Brazilian cuisine is

00:32:10.185 --> 00:32:13.650
a possible dream.

00:32:13.650 --> 00:32:19.970
Try to people rethink about
or review their own relation

00:32:19.970 --> 00:32:26.130
with food, even if it's
tough, it's disgusting,

00:32:26.130 --> 00:32:29.210
see someone killing a chicken.

00:32:29.210 --> 00:32:35.250
Our grandma used to do, and
we have a so romantic memory

00:32:35.250 --> 00:32:36.680
from that flavor.

00:32:36.680 --> 00:32:38.885
And our grandma used to
save even the feathers.

00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:46.765
Urban chefs nowadays just
take the phone-- urban chefs.

00:32:46.765 --> 00:32:49.620
I'm not talking all
chefs in the world.

00:32:49.620 --> 00:32:52.140
But in general, chefs
just order ingredients,

00:32:52.140 --> 00:32:59.620
or part of ingredients--
rack of lamb,

00:32:59.620 --> 00:33:03.190
fillet of salmon, chicken wings.

00:33:03.190 --> 00:33:04.070
How much you waste?

00:33:08.680 --> 00:33:13.310
What is our relation with
the trash, the garbage?

00:33:13.310 --> 00:33:15.450
People super cool.

00:33:15.450 --> 00:33:22.870
They select the trash, and
then they put out of house,

00:33:22.870 --> 00:33:26.000
and close the door-- finished.

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:27.540
No.

00:33:27.540 --> 00:33:30.800
This goes somewhere.

00:33:30.800 --> 00:33:36.010
We might to understand this,
to use better our ingredients,

00:33:36.010 --> 00:33:41.480
and respect more that
live chicken who I killed,

00:33:41.480 --> 00:33:44.550
or we kill every day.

00:33:44.550 --> 00:33:45.510
Sorry, guys.

00:33:45.510 --> 00:33:51.950
All chickens that you have
ate in your life has died.

00:33:51.950 --> 00:33:54.970
It is amazing.

00:33:54.970 --> 00:33:57.900
It's funny how we lost this.

00:33:57.900 --> 00:34:03.860
And even chefs-- I can
even go one step forward.

00:34:03.860 --> 00:34:07.590
Chefs, lots of chefs
nowadays, have more fear

00:34:07.590 --> 00:34:11.330
for one entire dead
animal in his kitchen

00:34:11.330 --> 00:34:14.750
than one alive animal
in his kitchen.

00:34:14.750 --> 00:34:20.640
One alive animal,
you can push away.

00:34:20.640 --> 00:34:26.010
But one entire dead animal, no.

00:34:26.010 --> 00:34:28.409
Why do you make sausage?

00:34:28.409 --> 00:34:37.670
Our previous generations used
to make sausage for saving meat,

00:34:37.670 --> 00:34:43.500
to preserve dead life,
dead meat longer.

00:34:47.280 --> 00:34:50.130
Human relations with
food might be reviewed.

00:34:50.130 --> 00:34:53.469
It is as simple as it.

00:34:53.469 --> 00:34:58.740
Behind every dish,
there's death,

00:34:58.740 --> 00:35:02.640
even if you are
vegetarian or vegan.

00:35:02.640 --> 00:35:04.810
Sorry, guys.

00:35:04.810 --> 00:35:08.150
Behind ever dish,
there is death.

00:35:08.150 --> 00:35:10.830
CHRIS YING: You've been talking
about the institute you started

00:35:10.830 --> 00:35:14.420
to try to connect the
supply line from Amazonas

00:35:14.420 --> 00:35:17.640
to the restaurants, and connect
these people who are growing

00:35:17.640 --> 00:35:19.509
ingredients to the urban market.

00:35:19.509 --> 00:35:21.550
Can you talk a little bit
about what you guys do,

00:35:21.550 --> 00:35:23.600
what the institute does?

00:35:23.600 --> 00:35:28.560
ALEX ATALA: Today I was
visiting your amazing campus,

00:35:28.560 --> 00:35:32.810
and someone told me that
you guys produce honey.

00:35:32.810 --> 00:35:35.640
And I became fascinated by it.

00:35:35.640 --> 00:35:40.260
Let me tell you what
we do with honey,

00:35:40.260 --> 00:35:44.476
and what is these bees
that you guys have.

00:35:44.476 --> 00:35:47.670
Those bees who
produce honey that we

00:35:47.670 --> 00:35:56.090
have been eating for our entire
life, it is one type of bee

00:35:56.090 --> 00:35:58.000
called apis mellifera.

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:00.650
If you don't know, Google it.

00:36:00.650 --> 00:36:03.060
It's easy.

00:36:03.060 --> 00:36:06.240
We didn't have this
bee in America.

00:36:06.240 --> 00:36:10.677
This bee has been introduced
from Africa and Europe

00:36:10.677 --> 00:36:11.260
into Americas.

00:36:14.700 --> 00:36:20.900
This bee produces a
huge amount of honey.

00:36:20.900 --> 00:36:30.630
And the honey is very stable.

00:36:30.630 --> 00:36:35.300
The honey that we
know has 20% humidity.

00:36:35.300 --> 00:36:40.330
That means you can leave in
your cuisine, in your kitchen,

00:36:40.330 --> 00:36:47.200
in your room, and it will be
the same product ever-- maybe

00:36:47.200 --> 00:36:49.490
crystallized, but
there is no change.

00:36:53.850 --> 00:36:59.500
Between north of
Argentina and to Florida,

00:36:59.500 --> 00:37:06.730
we have more than 500
different types of honeybees.

00:37:06.730 --> 00:37:10.180
They are tiny, tiny, tiny bees.

00:37:10.180 --> 00:37:13.010
They didn't produce
lots of honey.

00:37:13.010 --> 00:37:19.390
But the flavor of those
honeys are amazing.

00:37:19.390 --> 00:37:24.860
These tiny bees didn't have
stings, so they didn't bite us.

00:37:24.860 --> 00:37:26.170
They're called friendly bees.

00:37:28.770 --> 00:37:32.430
This honey has
medical possibilities,

00:37:32.430 --> 00:37:42.140
but for some reason,
which is healthy,

00:37:42.140 --> 00:37:49.800
security, or health loss
[SPEAKING PORTUGUESE]

00:37:49.800 --> 00:37:54.310
parameters, those
honeys in Brazil,

00:37:54.310 --> 00:37:56.860
we are not allowed to use.

00:37:56.860 --> 00:37:58.790
We can't use it.

00:37:58.790 --> 00:38:02.610
I can't use it.

00:38:02.610 --> 00:38:04.000
I use it.

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:07.110
And I pray every day
for someone to arrest me

00:38:07.110 --> 00:38:13.870
because I'm using an illegal
ingredient in my restaurant.

00:38:13.870 --> 00:38:15.680
Let me try to explain this.

00:38:15.680 --> 00:38:18.150
That honey is not
legal just because they

00:38:18.150 --> 00:38:23.230
have between 30%
and 35% humidity.

00:38:23.230 --> 00:38:28.060
It is a live ingredient,
as live as wine or cheese.

00:38:28.060 --> 00:38:29.640
Fermentation happens in there.

00:38:32.420 --> 00:38:36.830
Now, this is super trendy in
our [INAUDIBLE] cuisine talking

00:38:36.830 --> 00:38:39.340
about fermentation.

00:38:39.340 --> 00:38:41.010
I used to do as well.

00:38:41.010 --> 00:38:42.960
But fermentation
happens everywhere,

00:38:42.960 --> 00:38:45.130
and we might [INAUDIBLE].

00:38:45.130 --> 00:38:48.630
So this is a live ingredient
that we can manage.

00:38:48.630 --> 00:38:54.540
There's no real risks for human
population in those honeys.

00:38:54.540 --> 00:38:59.990
But unfortunately, our law
has simply forgot this.

00:38:59.990 --> 00:39:02.340
In one single
ingredient, we can see

00:39:02.340 --> 00:39:07.470
all the food chain connected.

00:39:07.470 --> 00:39:13.990
If I change, or our institute
achieves to change this law,

00:39:13.990 --> 00:39:20.900
and this product became
legal, as a chef,

00:39:20.900 --> 00:39:23.580
I can have a few more
flavors, a few more,

00:39:23.580 --> 00:39:25.590
because it's not
one flavor of honey.

00:39:25.590 --> 00:39:29.800
It's a huge variation of flavor.

00:39:29.800 --> 00:39:33.300
My customers, the
foodies, are going

00:39:33.300 --> 00:39:35.310
to have a few more ingredients.

00:39:38.350 --> 00:39:43.020
Medical research can also
have more possibilities.

00:39:43.020 --> 00:39:49.000
Local people can
raise these bees.

00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:50.780
They are friendly,
so they didn't

00:39:50.780 --> 00:39:53.590
bite kids or dogs or pets.

00:39:53.590 --> 00:39:56.230
You can have it at home.

00:39:56.230 --> 00:39:59.880
They are tiny bees.

00:39:59.880 --> 00:40:03.340
It's part of our biodiversity.

00:40:03.340 --> 00:40:05.710
It's part of our culture.

00:40:05.710 --> 00:40:09.150
If that can be income
for local people,

00:40:09.150 --> 00:40:11.140
there is a social benefit.

00:40:11.140 --> 00:40:13.970
There's economic benefit.

00:40:13.970 --> 00:40:18.180
And the last step--
bees just produce

00:40:18.180 --> 00:40:22.940
honey in a healthy ecosystem.

00:40:22.940 --> 00:40:29.650
So in one single ingredient,
you can understand all the food

00:40:29.650 --> 00:40:31.360
chain.

00:40:31.360 --> 00:40:35.430
We are trying to
make these products.

00:40:35.430 --> 00:40:37.790
So nowadays, we are
working with honey.

00:40:37.790 --> 00:40:45.040
We are pushing one project,
which is Amazonas mushrooms.

00:40:45.040 --> 00:40:48.120
It is funny that
our culture don't

00:40:48.120 --> 00:40:55.350
know about possible
mushrooms in Amazonas.

00:40:55.350 --> 00:40:59.710
So in Brazil, if you
want to buy mushrooms,

00:40:59.710 --> 00:41:04.695
you must buy [INAUDIBLE]
champignon, portobello,

00:41:04.695 --> 00:41:08.340
shimeji, shiitake, but
we didn't have our own.

00:41:08.340 --> 00:41:13.590
And natives used to
harvest, and we didn't know,

00:41:13.590 --> 00:41:16.750
or we knew but we
didn't make it.

00:41:16.750 --> 00:41:22.970
So we are trying to create
a project or a meeting,

00:41:22.970 --> 00:41:28.420
but not trying to make
mushroom farms in Amazonas.

00:41:28.420 --> 00:41:34.550
We just find the spots
and put more wood.

00:41:34.550 --> 00:41:43.366
These mushrooms grow in dead
pieces, or old pieces of wood.

00:41:43.366 --> 00:41:44.740
So we are putting
them in, and we

00:41:44.740 --> 00:41:51.750
hope that after December,
in one month and a half,

00:41:51.750 --> 00:41:54.960
the rainy season
starts again, and we

00:41:54.960 --> 00:41:57.670
will see if this idea
is going to work.

00:41:57.670 --> 00:42:01.435
But I do believe that
that can be possible.

00:42:04.150 --> 00:42:05.120
I lost myself.

00:42:05.120 --> 00:42:06.300
Sorry.

00:42:06.300 --> 00:42:10.050
We have nowadays nine
different projects,

00:42:10.050 --> 00:42:13.470
always connect one ingredient
with the local producers.

00:42:13.470 --> 00:42:18.110
One of the most
beautiful is the rice.

00:42:18.110 --> 00:42:26.230
Nine years ago, a little bit
back, agrobusiness in Brazil

00:42:26.230 --> 00:42:28.620
is very important
for our economy.

00:42:28.620 --> 00:42:33.950
Rice production is always so
important for our economy.

00:42:33.950 --> 00:42:37.390
There's a long valley between
Sao Paulo called Rio de Janeiro

00:42:37.390 --> 00:42:39.070
Janeiro called the
Vale do Paraiba.

00:42:39.070 --> 00:42:44.000
It's the first rice plantation,
or the first rice plant

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:48.350
tradition that we
have in Brazil.

00:42:48.350 --> 00:42:53.000
Almost 50 years ago, south of
Brazil starts producing rice,

00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:56.220
and south of Brazil, the
ground, the soil is much better.

00:42:56.220 --> 00:43:02.800
So they produced double
amount by hectare, the valley.

00:43:02.800 --> 00:43:10.460
In a country which agrobusiness
is a scale business,

00:43:10.460 --> 00:43:13.985
that valley was
already increased.

00:43:16.880 --> 00:43:21.110
They didn't produce as much,
The small producers even more,

00:43:21.110 --> 00:43:26.460
because rice was a commodity,
and they didn't have scale.

00:43:26.460 --> 00:43:30.810
So they have been pushed
from their own land.

00:43:30.810 --> 00:43:35.930
One researcher,
or one scientist,

00:43:35.930 --> 00:43:42.390
which we call breeder,
decided to convince

00:43:42.390 --> 00:43:45.410
one small producer
to plant black rice.

00:43:45.410 --> 00:43:49.260
Just to let you know, guys,
in Brazil, in the old days,

00:43:49.260 --> 00:43:57.010
black rice was considered a
disease, a rice disease, OK?

00:43:57.010 --> 00:44:00.470
This breeder has
convinced this young guy

00:44:00.470 --> 00:44:01.950
to produce this black rice.

00:44:01.950 --> 00:44:03.290
And they made it.

00:44:03.290 --> 00:44:04.880
And they have a huge success.

00:44:04.880 --> 00:44:08.730
They harvested a
huge amount of rice.

00:44:08.730 --> 00:44:12.100
The problem was, nobody
wants to buy black rice.

00:44:12.100 --> 00:44:18.090
For our culture, black
rice is not a good rice.

00:44:18.090 --> 00:44:20.510
They became a complete loss.

00:44:20.510 --> 00:44:24.500
So they decided-- this
is a true history--

00:44:24.500 --> 00:44:30.350
they decided to buy gastronomic
magazines, and they found me.

00:44:30.350 --> 00:44:33.420
So one day I was in my
restaurant nine years ago.

00:44:33.420 --> 00:44:35.170
They touched at my door.

00:44:35.170 --> 00:44:37.470
I opened the door.

00:44:37.470 --> 00:44:48.350
It was a small producer, very
dressed as a countryside guy,

00:44:48.350 --> 00:44:50.900
and this researcher.

00:44:50.900 --> 00:44:52.470
They gave me this black rice.

00:44:52.470 --> 00:44:54.740
Please, help us, they said.

00:44:54.740 --> 00:44:58.180
I tasted it, and the texture
and flavor was beautiful.

00:44:58.180 --> 00:45:00.590
So I started to use
in the same day.

00:45:00.590 --> 00:45:04.380
And I started to talk with
other chefs, and thank God,

00:45:04.380 --> 00:45:10.260
the Brazilian press has also
talked largely about this rice.

00:45:10.260 --> 00:45:14.870
Nowadays, this rice
has spread everywhere,

00:45:14.870 --> 00:45:16.370
really everywhere,
even in Amazonas.

00:45:20.430 --> 00:45:25.310
Between three and four years
ago, this breeder got cancer.

00:45:25.310 --> 00:45:28.220
And he knew that
he was terminal.

00:45:28.220 --> 00:45:32.230
So he called me and said,
Alex, come to is visit me.

00:45:32.230 --> 00:45:34.260
I want to talk with you.

00:45:34.260 --> 00:45:37.555
I went in there, and he showed
me a tiny, tiny, tiny bowl

00:45:37.555 --> 00:45:44.460
of rice, ball-shaped rice,
and said please, do something

00:45:44.460 --> 00:45:45.500
with this.

00:45:45.500 --> 00:45:49.130
I'm going to pass away, and
this is my last research.

00:45:51.840 --> 00:45:54.100
We made it.

00:45:54.100 --> 00:45:59.490
Nowadays, this rice is,
again, spread in everywhere.

00:45:59.490 --> 00:46:02.620
But the beautiful, the
most beautiful history,

00:46:02.620 --> 00:46:06.250
or beautiful goal
of this history

00:46:06.250 --> 00:46:09.100
is not the black rice
or the small rice.

00:46:09.100 --> 00:46:13.340
All the valley nowadays
is not planting

00:46:13.340 --> 00:46:19.250
black rice or mini rice.

00:46:19.250 --> 00:46:23.210
All the small producers
are planting special rice.

00:46:23.210 --> 00:46:27.900
I mean koshihikari,
Japanese rice, jasmine rise,

00:46:27.900 --> 00:46:30.790
basmati rice.

00:46:30.790 --> 00:46:32.905
They realized
something very simple.

00:46:35.540 --> 00:46:38.520
Big wines, big cheeses
in Europe are not

00:46:38.520 --> 00:46:39.840
produced by big companies.

00:46:42.590 --> 00:46:46.040
Producing quality can
be the biggest goal

00:46:46.040 --> 00:46:50.110
for a small producer,
if the market pays.

00:46:54.740 --> 00:47:01.690
Our dream in Ata is keep
doing things like this.

00:47:01.690 --> 00:47:04.330
This project with
the rice, for me,

00:47:04.330 --> 00:47:11.820
it's very meaningful,
because the biggest goal

00:47:11.820 --> 00:47:15.360
it is to change
one local culture.

00:47:15.360 --> 00:47:20.710
We are learning something more
which is very tough for us.

00:47:20.710 --> 00:47:24.240
We created a label, which
is called Retratas do Gosto.

00:47:24.240 --> 00:47:30.220
That means faces of flavor,
maybe something like this.

00:47:30.220 --> 00:47:38.560
And we give all support
for local people

00:47:38.560 --> 00:47:43.130
if they produce a good
ingredient, healthy ingredient.

00:47:43.130 --> 00:47:49.190
And we to package and
to sell everything.

00:47:49.190 --> 00:47:51.720
And we have benefits,
economic benefits.

00:47:51.720 --> 00:47:58.300
25% of our benefits, might
go back to the lands,

00:47:58.300 --> 00:48:00.100
not for the producer.

00:48:00.100 --> 00:48:03.510
So you with the black
rice, what we did

00:48:03.510 --> 00:48:09.460
was build a new
research center, not

00:48:09.460 --> 00:48:11.860
to help only the
guys who were already

00:48:11.860 --> 00:48:17.210
planting black rice or
small rice or mini rice,

00:48:17.210 --> 00:48:21.420
guys who are not included
in our philosophy

00:48:21.420 --> 00:48:25.360
to plant different
rice or special rice.

00:48:25.360 --> 00:48:32.490
The next step, try to convince
them to plant organic rice.

00:48:32.490 --> 00:48:35.740
And let me explain why.

00:48:35.740 --> 00:48:40.060
These small producers
sometimes need money.

00:48:40.060 --> 00:48:43.230
They might go to the bank.

00:48:43.230 --> 00:48:48.640
The bank might
guarantee his money.

00:48:48.640 --> 00:48:51.330
And the only way that
the bank can believe,

00:48:51.330 --> 00:48:56.000
and also the small producer
believe that the harvest will

00:48:56.000 --> 00:49:05.490
be safe, and they can pay back
the bank, is buying chemicals.

00:49:05.490 --> 00:49:11.120
So when a Brazilian small
producer signs a bank contract,

00:49:11.120 --> 00:49:18.370
it's included that he might
buy those specific seeds that

00:49:18.370 --> 00:49:23.760
come from a big company,
and those chemicals that

00:49:23.760 --> 00:49:27.020
come from another company.

00:49:27.020 --> 00:49:30.560
This is a cultural barrier.

00:49:30.560 --> 00:49:34.300
Those guys, I can't
blame them, the bank

00:49:34.300 --> 00:49:38.190
or the small producers.

00:49:38.190 --> 00:49:39.810
It is just a cultural barrier.

00:49:39.810 --> 00:49:45.470
They didn't believe that
organic food is a possible way.

00:49:45.470 --> 00:49:48.760
They don't know.

00:49:48.760 --> 00:49:57.430
How can one bank be convinced
that organic agriculture

00:49:57.430 --> 00:50:06.770
is something real, if
there are companies

00:50:06.770 --> 00:50:11.870
who support money
to sell chemicals?

00:50:11.870 --> 00:50:14.900
And nobody can
explain to them how

00:50:14.900 --> 00:50:20.860
we can change the culture
from the local people,

00:50:20.860 --> 00:50:28.250
if the last 15 years, they
only learned to put chemicals,

00:50:28.250 --> 00:50:31.160
and nobody knows
anymore how to--

00:50:31.160 --> 00:50:36.310
So it is our
commitment nowadays,

00:50:36.310 --> 00:50:46.750
is to try to improve
the food chain,

00:50:46.750 --> 00:50:51.260
organize, revalue,
and trying to not make

00:50:51.260 --> 00:50:54.560
big changes in the food web.

00:50:57.670 --> 00:51:01.380
It is two very difficult
lines, but we keep trying.

00:51:01.380 --> 00:51:03.340
And I don't know if
we will be successful,

00:51:03.340 --> 00:51:06.930
but it's our challenge.

00:51:06.930 --> 00:51:08.930
AUDIENCE: You were talking
before about the size

00:51:08.930 --> 00:51:11.013
of the United States, and
that it's a melting pot,

00:51:11.013 --> 00:51:13.600
and that there's so many
different flavors here.

00:51:13.600 --> 00:51:16.700
And I think about the
size of the Amazon,

00:51:16.700 --> 00:51:19.500
and it's humongous
on the scale that's

00:51:19.500 --> 00:51:22.820
difficult to comprehend,
which would tend

00:51:22.820 --> 00:51:26.120
to make me think that throughout
there, even the native cultures

00:51:26.120 --> 00:51:27.900
are going to have
a lot of variations

00:51:27.900 --> 00:51:31.200
and different flavors
and different styles.

00:51:31.200 --> 00:51:35.630
And how has that
affected your cooking?

00:51:35.630 --> 00:51:37.175
ALEX ATALA: Well,
this on one hand

00:51:37.175 --> 00:51:40.600
gives us more possibilities.

00:51:40.600 --> 00:51:45.080
So it's on one hand
super exciting.

00:51:45.080 --> 00:51:51.870
Of course, when you
have this big melting

00:51:51.870 --> 00:51:58.760
pot, which we are as
well, it is not so easy.

00:52:02.580 --> 00:52:12.200
But why do you stop your
car when the sign is red?

00:52:12.200 --> 00:52:15.200
It is not to not crash your car.

00:52:15.200 --> 00:52:20.300
Is for benefits for the
whole entire community,

00:52:20.300 --> 00:52:21.430
to help traffic.

00:52:24.430 --> 00:52:29.480
I mean, this is the
most simple thing.

00:52:29.480 --> 00:52:31.610
We might to believe
that it's possible.

00:52:31.610 --> 00:52:36.310
If you start to do, someone
is going to start to do,

00:52:36.310 --> 00:52:39.010
and this creates a kind of wave.

00:52:39.010 --> 00:52:42.420
Chefs nowadays have
more voice than ever.

00:52:46.010 --> 00:52:51.050
Our first commitment, of
course, is make nice food

00:52:51.050 --> 00:52:52.850
for customers.

00:52:52.850 --> 00:52:56.640
But we can go one step forward.

00:52:56.640 --> 00:52:59.890
We can try to provoke
a few changes.

00:52:59.890 --> 00:53:03.160
If I have a voice, I can
have more voice to say,

00:53:03.160 --> 00:53:04.260
look how beautiful I am.

00:53:04.260 --> 00:53:09.890
Or I can have more voice
to spread another message.

00:53:09.890 --> 00:53:16.040
And we are trying to do this.

00:53:16.040 --> 00:53:22.280
I don't know if it's too
romantic, almost utopic.

00:53:22.280 --> 00:53:26.420
But man, when I
went in the kitchen,

00:53:26.420 --> 00:53:29.630
nobody wants you to be a chef.

00:53:29.630 --> 00:53:31.160
I was a punk rocker.

00:53:31.160 --> 00:53:35.230
Nobody wanted to give
a job for myself.

00:53:35.230 --> 00:53:39.050
So I can keep going.

00:53:39.050 --> 00:53:40.770
[LAUGHS]

00:53:40.770 --> 00:53:43.860
AUDIENCE: With the world cup
and the Olympics coming up,

00:53:43.860 --> 00:53:45.470
what are you doing
in preparation

00:53:45.470 --> 00:53:48.950
to help spread that message,
as in international guests

00:53:48.950 --> 00:53:51.210
will be arriving in Brazil?

00:53:51.210 --> 00:53:53.390
ALEX ATALA: This is a
challenging, difficult,

00:53:53.390 --> 00:53:54.240
and good question.

00:53:59.120 --> 00:54:06.140
As a chef, my first thought
is I can't answer this.

00:54:06.140 --> 00:54:08.160
This is a government thing.

00:54:08.160 --> 00:54:11.460
I can solve a few
problems that I have.

00:54:11.460 --> 00:54:17.890
As a Brazilian
citizen, all the world

00:54:17.890 --> 00:54:19.520
will be watching my country.

00:54:19.520 --> 00:54:22.460
We might do something.

00:54:22.460 --> 00:54:29.340
It is time to show how beautiful
things are happening in Brazil.

00:54:29.340 --> 00:54:34.690
As a chef, and part
of one institute,

00:54:34.690 --> 00:54:44.180
we are trying to
share our know-how.

00:54:44.180 --> 00:54:50.780
So we have a small project with
kids with a few things, one

00:54:50.780 --> 00:54:57.980
of them, and maybe I
will not talk today.

00:54:57.980 --> 00:55:01.340
But I really
believe that cuisine

00:55:01.340 --> 00:55:05.360
can be a very possible way
to social reintegration.

00:55:09.130 --> 00:55:14.230
My sous chef, my
right arm in cuisine

00:55:14.230 --> 00:55:20.550
was a guy who, 14 years ago,
wasn't able to write or read.

00:55:20.550 --> 00:55:24.120
14 years later, he's trying
to enter in a university.

00:55:26.930 --> 00:55:30.580
There's different
levels of reintegration,

00:55:30.580 --> 00:55:32.570
or social reintegration.

00:55:32.570 --> 00:55:37.790
And all of them, the
kitchen can be helpful.

00:55:37.790 --> 00:55:39.375
So we are trying
to do a few things.

00:55:43.540 --> 00:55:45.650
We are planting seeds.

00:55:45.650 --> 00:55:50.950
I don't know how big are going
to be this herb or this tree.

00:55:50.950 --> 00:55:54.901
But we keep doing.

00:55:54.901 --> 00:55:55.692
CHRIS YING: Thanks.

00:55:55.692 --> 00:55:56.924
Thanks, Alex.

00:55:56.924 --> 00:55:58.090
ALEX ATALA: Thank you, guys.

00:55:58.090 --> 00:55:58.840
Thank you, Google.

00:55:58.840 --> 00:56:03.386
