I am happy. I like making videos for you guys. You guys are the best,

2
00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.730
but I've got to call this trend out less, less,

3
00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.770
more. Here's my version of that fed. Less, less,

4
00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.590
and now more. Ooh, wait, wait, wait.

5
00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.930
This is not going to be video chaos.

6
00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.490
Let me Orient you first. These beauties animated.

7
00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.320
It takes on language and communication.

8
00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.740
These take like 20 plus hours per minute of finished footage,

9
00:00:28.741 --> 00:00:33.741
so please enjoy no pressure but enjoy them in eavesdropping traveler,

10
00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.580
each vineyard takes a charming,

11
00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.690
quirky look at a destination through its local language. I take pictures,

12
00:00:39.691 --> 00:00:42.750
create art, and even write music for these. Finally,

13
00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:47.010
what began his plans for behind the sous take is putting into its own series a

14
00:00:47.011 --> 00:00:51.720
series that's more direct, a bit villagey and ties in a random topic each time.

15
00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:57.180
There's still the old stuff last year is questions about human language and even

16
00:00:57.181 --> 00:01:01.020
older technical lessons aren't getting updated, but they're still around.

17
00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:04.230
All right. Have at it. See when the videos.
