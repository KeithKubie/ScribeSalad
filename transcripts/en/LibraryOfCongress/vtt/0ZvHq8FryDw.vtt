00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:06.290
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:11.620
&gt;&gt; Our next guests are
co-authors of This is Just a Test.

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:15.870
Madelyn Rosenberg and
Wendy Wan-Long Shang.

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.650 position:56%
When she was in fifth grade, Madelyn
Rosenberg wrote a story entitled,

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.720
How the Raccoon Got His Mask.

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.020
Is that correct?

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:26.370
Yeah. Her family took this as a
clue that she'd become an author

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:28.770
of children's literature
as an adult.

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:31.190
And she did just that.

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:35.230 position:56%
Madelyn Rosenberg has written many
books appealing to kids of all ages,

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:41.550
such as How to Behave at a
Tea Party, The Nanny X books.

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.440
Her middle grade and young
adult books include The Canary

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.820
in a Coal Mine and Dream Boy.

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:50.790
Fans love her for their
humor or fans love her books

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:54.100
for their humor and inventiveness.

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.710
When Wendy Wan-Long
Shang was a young girl,

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:01.540 position:56%
she realized that books gave her the
freedom to "learn about anything,

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:04.180
go anywhere, pretend to be anyone."

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:07.900
It's not surprise that
she became an author.

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:12.090
Her award-winning books include
The Great Wall of Lucy Wu,

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.740
and The Way Home Looks Now.

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.910
Their newest book, This is
Just a Test, tells the story

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:22.620
of a bicultural young man trying to
make sense of the world around him

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:25.640
in cold war 80's America.

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:29.300
Reviewers and readers alike
give it a big thumbs up.

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:33.470
So be sure to stop by the Politics
and Pros Bookshop to pick up a copy

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:37.510
and then get it signed
between 11 a.m. and noon.

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:40.640
So without further adieu,
let's give a round of applause

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.510
and a warm welcome to Madelyn
Rosenberg and Wendy Wan-Long Shang.

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:49.390
[ Applause ]

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:52.280
&gt;&gt; Wendy Wan-Long Shang:
Good morning, everyone.

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.060
I'm Wendy Shang.

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.870
&gt;&gt; Madelyn Rosenberg:
I'm Madelyn Rosenberg.

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:57.170
&gt;&gt; Wendy Wan-Long Shang:
And as he just said,

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:00.190
we are the authors of
This is Just a Test.

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:04.670
So how many of you have ever
seen two people get into a fight

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:08.350
and wonder should you speak up
or maybe if you just kept quiet,

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:10.790
everything would blow over?

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:14.200
That's pretty much what's going
on with our main character,

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.940
David Da-Wei Horowitz who is
half Chinese and half Jewish.

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:22.890
And no one in David's
world is getting along.

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.210
His grandmothers don't get along,

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:26.840
and his friends aren't
getting along.

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:31.330
It's the 80's, so really it feels
like the world isn't getting along.

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:34.160
But when David starts
entertaining the idea

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.760
that he could leave a friend
out of an important project,

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:41.050
he learns that there are
no shortcuts to peace.

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:45.030
&gt;&gt; Madelyn Rosenberg: And
we're going to start by --

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.800
I'm just going to read a
little bit from the beginning.

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:52.250
Even though we work together,
we are different heights

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:59.330
so I need a smaller -- so our book
starts out where David's class is

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:04.190
on a school field trip at a farm
in Virginia where almost everything

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:08.590
on the farm is dead
including the poison ivy.

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:12.450
The teachers told a group of
us to sit at the picnic tables

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:15.290
so they could pass around
seeds and dry gourds,

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:18.180
which Mr. McKemmon
actually did grow.

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:21.740
Hector, my best friend,
squirmed between the bench

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:24.020 position:56%
and the table and ducked underneath.

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:25.320
What are you doing?

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:30.100
I asked. The other kids
were giving Hector a look.

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:32.450 position:56%
It's shadier down here, Hector said.

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:37.090
One thing I'll say about Hector, he
is not afraid to be unconventional.

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:40.280
It used to be a quality I
admired like when Hector suggested

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:43.670
that we do everything backwards
for a week or when he signed us

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:47.120
up for correspondence classes in
French because he wanted to go

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:49.190 position:56%
to the Cannes Film Festival one day.

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:50.490
But in junior high,

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:54.560
unconventionality was usually
just another word for dork.

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:56.400
Knock off, I told Hector.

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.750
I was pretty sure under
the transitive property

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:01.830
of junior high school social lives
whatever our group was thinking

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:05.110
of Hector, they were going
to start thinking of me.

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:06.660
Hector popped back up.

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:10.740
My little brother does that all
the time, said Kelly Ann Majors.

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:14.440
I happen to know that Kelly
Ann's little brother was eight.

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:17.310
It was one of the facts I
had collected about her.

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:21.000
It was also exactly what I was
afraid someone would think.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.990
Watch this, said Scott Dirsky who
was in a couple of my classes.

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:28.630
Under normal circumstances, I
ignored Scott and his stunts,

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:31.880
but now he was providing a
distraction, the good kind.

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:35.050
I watched him, hoping everyone
else would too as he walked

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:38.650
to the oak tree that had a bunch
of vines attacking the trunk.

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:40.990
It looked like tentacles.

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:44.770
Scott grabbed one to try to
get some climbing leverage,

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:46.400
but the vine was loose, and it fell

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:48.530
out of the tree while
he was holding it.

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:51.140
Terry [inaudible] stood
behind him and said nice try,

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:53.040
let me show you how it's done.

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:55.350
Scott grabbed a different
vine for a better hold.

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:56.650
It was furry.

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:00.180
Even from where we were sitting,
I could tell it was poison ivy.

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:02.530
That's poison ivy, I told Hector.

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:04.510
They shouldn't be touching that.

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:05.810
Hey, Hector shouted.

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:07.780
That's poison ivy!

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:10.590
Says who? Scott didn't
let go of the vine,

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:13.190
but you could see his
grip relax slightly.

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:14.830
Says David, said Hector.

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:16.480
We walked over to the tree.

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:19.020 position:56%
I don't see any leaves, said Hector.

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:21.830
You can get poison ivy from
the vine, too, I told him.

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:24.140
You know, hairy vine,
no friend of mine?

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:26.570
It still contains [inaudible].

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:28.650
I've never heard that, Scott said.

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:30.330
But he let go of the vine.

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:32.330
He's making it up, said Terry.

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:36.320
He patted the vine which looked
like the tail of a scruffy cat.

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:38.060
This is my pet, Lucky.

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:40.160
He would never hurt me.

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:41.850
Don't you want to meet my pet?

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:45.120
He reached for the closest
girl who shrieked and ran away.

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:47.150
Why would I make it up?

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:50.350
I said. If I were going to make
something up, it would be something

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:54.070
like studying too much for your
bar mitzvah can stunt your growth

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:58.080
or eating only Chinese food
causes premature baldness.

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:01.170
Personally, I would like to spend a
lot less time studying [inaudible]

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:03.510
and more time eating pizza.

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:07.340
And that's sort of how we
begin our story about David.

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:11.860
&gt;&gt; Wendy Wan-Long Shang: So
it's a little strange for us

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:15.380
in anything basically in the
kidlet world that's over ten years.

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:17.100
It's set more than
ten years in the past.

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:19.700
It's considered historical fiction.

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:22.550
But even knowing that, it's a
little devastating to realize

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:26.150
that something set in the 80's
is considered historical fiction,

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:27.900
but when you think about it,
when we start thinking about it,

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:30.780
we realize that there are things
from the 80's that we mention

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:35.950 position:56%
in the book that would be completely
foreign to young readers today.

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:40.190
So -- and we want to remind
you people when you start --

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:42.210
if you're tempted to start
laughing at some of these things,

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:47.430
one day that maybe 2017 will
seem kind of historical.

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:48.730
&gt;&gt; Madelyn Rosenberg: That's right.

00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:51.240
If you guys are walking around,
and you've seen people with clothes

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:52.690
where the shoulders are exposed,

00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:54.910
I think it's called the
cold shoulder, right?

00:06:54.910 --> 00:06:58.600
That's going to be 2017,
and there are 2000 --

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:01.600
there are different
voices, different vocabulary

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:04.660
that people are going to
be using in the future

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:07.760
so that the things we say
now are going to be strange.

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:11.480
And [inaudible] are one of
the things that I think is --

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:14.620
was different when
we were growing up.

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:17.470
And I don't have Diet
Coke in this picture,

00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:20.680
but I should because you see
Diet Coke everywhere, right?

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:25.580
That wasn't invented until 1982.

00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:28.070
&gt;&gt; Wendy Wan-Long Shang:
Wait, hold on.

00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:30.440
&gt;&gt; Madelyn Rosenberg:
One microphone.

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:31.740
&gt;&gt; Wendy Wan-Long Shang:

00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:34.420
Another thing that was
different were video games.

00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:36.260
Who here likes to play video games?

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:39.670
Oh yeah. So what do you --
use your thumbs, right, right?

00:07:39.670 --> 00:07:43.630
You have a screen, and you
can see lots of cool stuff.

00:07:43.630 --> 00:07:45.570
Well, video games looked
a little different,

00:07:45.570 --> 00:07:49.060 position:56%
and we played them a little
differently when we were growing up.

00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:52.170
So this is a picture from a game
called -- do you know the name?

00:07:52.170 --> 00:07:53.690
Space Invaders.

00:07:53.690 --> 00:07:56.280
Good job! And instead of
getting to use your thumbs

00:07:56.280 --> 00:08:01.150
and these virtual buttons and
everything, we got to use this.

00:08:01.150 --> 00:08:02.450
Look at this.

00:08:02.450 --> 00:08:04.280
Look at the range of
motion on this thing.

00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:06.270
Yeah. You had those?

00:08:06.270 --> 00:08:08.080
So we thought we'd demonstrate

00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:10.500
for you what it was
like to play with this.

00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:14.160
So Madelyn is going
to be my avatar, okay?

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:17.170
And we can only see
them from the side.

00:08:17.170 --> 00:08:20.770
So it'd be like go!

00:08:20.770 --> 00:08:22.900
Go! Go! Go!

00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:25.260
And maybe jump!

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:33.160
Jump! So you guys have it
much better than we did.

00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:35.370
&gt;&gt; Madelyn Rosenberg: Also
computers were something

00:08:35.370 --> 00:08:37.220
that looked a little bit different.

00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:40.110
They were -- not many
of us even had them.

00:08:40.110 --> 00:08:42.130
They certainly weren't
something that you carried

00:08:42.130 --> 00:08:46.630
around like a purse
or in your purse.

00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:47.930
&gt;&gt; Wendy Wan-Long Shang:
And in fact,

00:08:47.930 --> 00:08:50.230
how many of you use a thumb
drive at school or at work?

00:08:50.230 --> 00:08:54.930
Right? So this is actually
the more updated version

00:08:54.930 --> 00:08:57.650
of what we had to work with.

00:08:57.650 --> 00:09:01.380
Okay? This holds two megabytes.

00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:05.210
So if you wanted to have enough
storage to have the same amount

00:09:05.210 --> 00:09:10.470
in your 16 gigabyte, do you
know how many you would need?

00:09:10.470 --> 00:09:12.040
I can't hear you, what?

00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:15.090
They were called floppies,
but they were --

00:09:15.090 --> 00:09:17.990
the first ones were really skinny
and you could wave them back

00:09:17.990 --> 00:09:19.290
and they would kind of wiggle.

00:09:19.290 --> 00:09:21.420
These were like the
more updated versions.

00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:24.130
If you wanted to have
the same amount of memory

00:09:24.130 --> 00:09:27.240
in a 16 gigabytes thumb drive --

00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:28.540
&gt;&gt; Can't hear you.

00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:29.840
&gt;&gt; Wendy Wan-Long Shang: Oh.

00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:31.140
16 gigabytes thumb drive as
you could in one of these,

00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:35.130 position:56%
you would need over 11,000 of these.

00:09:35.130 --> 00:09:38.610
And speaking about carrying
things around in a purse,

00:09:38.610 --> 00:09:41.530
you guys want to guess
what's in here?

00:09:41.530 --> 00:09:42.830
What's in there?

00:09:42.830 --> 00:09:45.070
What do you think?

00:09:45.070 --> 00:09:46.370
What'd she say?

00:09:46.370 --> 00:09:47.860
&gt;&gt; Madelyn Rosenberg:
What'd you say?

00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:50.040
[ Inaudible ]

00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:51.340
&gt;&gt; Wendy Wan-Long Shang:
Another one of these.

00:09:51.340 --> 00:09:52.640
Yeah, we started carrying
the 11,000 in the purse?

00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:57.350
No. This is -- can you get it out?

00:09:57.350 --> 00:09:59.830
The Velcro is super strong in here.

00:09:59.830 --> 00:10:02.550
That was a cell phone.

00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:03.850
That's a cell phone.

00:10:03.850 --> 00:10:05.480
Okay, and this is really
-- you have to take it --

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:09.320
wait, you have to take it all the
way out with a very strong pull.

00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:12.810
Velcro. Look at this guys.

00:10:12.810 --> 00:10:15.390
Do you want to make a phone call?

00:10:15.390 --> 00:10:16.860
Here's your antenna.

00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:20.350
Dot, dot. Right?

00:10:20.350 --> 00:10:23.450
And you ever wonder why
we say hang up the phone?

00:10:23.450 --> 00:10:27.890
Right? Because you
hang up the phone.

00:10:27.890 --> 00:10:31.570
&gt;&gt; Madelyn Rosenberg: And
when you talked into it,

00:10:31.570 --> 00:10:33.870
it sounded like this
[crackling sound].

00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:39.340
&gt;&gt; Wendy Wan-Long Shang: Okay.

00:10:39.340 --> 00:10:40.640
And then speaking of other
expressions, we had expressions

00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:43.100
from the 80's, like if you thought
something was totally gross,

00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:46.880
you might say gag me
with a spoon or --

00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:49.280
&gt;&gt; Madelyn Rosenberg: That did not
get as far as southwest Virginia.

00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:52.070 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Wendy Wan-Long Shang: So what are
some of the -- what do you think --

00:10:52.070 --> 00:10:54.580
what are some of the phrases
that you guys have now

00:10:54.580 --> 00:10:56.340
that might seem like unusual?

00:10:56.340 --> 00:10:58.340
What do you think?

00:10:58.340 --> 00:10:59.920
What's that?

00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:02.200
[ Inaudible ]

00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:05.430
Oh. Or like LOL?

00:11:05.430 --> 00:11:07.280
You guys say LOL?

00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:09.400
Yeah? Yeah, a lot of those.

00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:10.700
They weren't around
when were [inaudible].

00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:13.950
There might be something totally
different 30 years from now.

00:11:13.950 --> 00:11:17.350
&gt;&gt; Madelyn Rosenberg: And then
the things that we wore were a lot

00:11:17.350 --> 00:11:20.290
of different -- really
different from they are now.

00:11:20.290 --> 00:11:21.590
The clothes were different.

00:11:21.590 --> 00:11:22.890
The colors were different.

00:11:22.890 --> 00:11:24.190
&gt;&gt; Wendy Wan-Long Shang:
The hair was different.

00:11:24.190 --> 00:11:25.960
&gt;&gt; Madelyn Rosenberg: Our
hair was very different.

00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:28.340
&gt;&gt; Wendy Wan-Long Shang: So we
wanted to take a moment to discuss

00:11:28.340 --> 00:11:31.410
to you the importance of
shoulder pads in the 80's.

00:11:31.410 --> 00:11:34.680
This was considered a
very important accessory.

00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:37.230
So let's say you had a
regular day at school.

00:11:37.230 --> 00:11:40.380
You might just have a one
shoulder pad situation.

00:11:40.380 --> 00:11:43.710
So it makes you look
strong and powerful.

00:11:43.710 --> 00:11:45.480
But what if you had a book report?

00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:49.360
Well then you'd want definitely a
bigger shoulder pad and if you were

00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:53.550
in trouble and you might have
to go visit the principal,

00:11:53.550 --> 00:11:57.990
you would definitely want the
biggest shoulder pads you had.

00:11:57.990 --> 00:12:01.770
So look at the pictures carefully.

00:12:01.770 --> 00:12:03.070
You could see the difference.

00:12:03.070 --> 00:12:04.780
So don't I look more
powerful on this side?

00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:08.850
It was a little strange.

00:12:08.850 --> 00:12:13.360
It was a little strange.

00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:15.970
And how did we listen to music?

00:12:15.970 --> 00:12:18.270
Here we go.

00:12:25.370 --> 00:12:28.430
&gt;&gt; Madelyn Rosenberg: So we used
Walkmans to listen to music,

00:12:28.430 --> 00:12:34.110
and we put cassette tapes in the
Walkmans and even though CD's came

00:12:34.110 --> 00:12:38.150
out in the 80's, this
was usually the method.

00:12:38.150 --> 00:12:39.740
&gt;&gt; Wendy Wan-Long Shang:
There we go.

00:12:39.740 --> 00:12:44.880
Yeah. They just had -- they had one
minor technical flaw [inaudible]

00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:50.090
occasionally went wrong,
and the tape would come out.

00:12:50.090 --> 00:12:52.390
But we had a fix.

00:13:00.350 --> 00:13:01.850
You could wind --

00:13:01.850 --> 00:13:04.040
[ Inaudible ]

00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:05.340
All right, we need a volunteer

00:13:05.340 --> 00:13:06.640
because we might need
this tape again.

00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:08.940
Okay.

00:13:11.510 --> 00:13:13.240
Thank you.

00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:14.540
All right.

00:13:14.540 --> 00:13:16.840
Wow.

00:13:20.190 --> 00:13:22.850
&gt;&gt; Madelyn Rosenberg: So
the things that we used

00:13:22.850 --> 00:13:24.990
when we were researching,
because we had

00:13:24.990 --> 00:13:26.710
to research our childhoods
a little bit,

00:13:26.710 --> 00:13:29.740
and when you research your
childhood, you come across props

00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:32.470
and they become sort of
the backdrop of the story.

00:13:32.470 --> 00:13:34.250
But the main parts of our story,

00:13:34.250 --> 00:13:39.610
the things that were most important
are things that kind of exist all

00:13:39.610 --> 00:13:42.930 position:56%
of the time through all of the ages.

00:13:42.930 --> 00:13:44.230 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Wendy Wan-Long Shang: Friendship.

00:13:44.230 --> 00:13:46.500
&gt;&gt; Madelyn Rosenberg: And family.

00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:48.490
&gt;&gt; Wendy Wan-Long Shang:
Conquering your fears.

00:13:48.490 --> 00:13:49.830
&gt;&gt; Madelyn Rosenberg:
And awkwardness,

00:13:49.830 --> 00:13:55.000
like if your hair gets really
frizzy because it's raining.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.280 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Wendy Wan-Long Shang: [Inaudible]
awkwardness is a common theme

00:13:57.280 --> 00:14:00.430
throughout the ages that
not every 10-year-old

00:14:00.430 --> 00:14:03.980
in ancient Rome had his [inaudible]
securely fastened leading

00:14:03.980 --> 00:14:05.450
to awkward moments, but we wanted

00:14:05.450 --> 00:14:08.830
to share an awkward
moment from our book.

00:14:08.830 --> 00:14:12.860
So at this point, have you
ever accidentally hit somebody?

00:14:12.860 --> 00:14:14.260
Like you were kind of
waving stuff around,

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:15.560
and you accidentally
bonked somebody,

00:14:15.560 --> 00:14:17.120
and you're like, "Oh, I'm sorry?"

00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:20.390
So our main character is actually
accidentally bonked the girl he

00:14:20.390 --> 00:14:26.300
really likes, and his sister,
Loren, is refusing to bail him out.

00:14:26.300 --> 00:14:28.930
Here's another question
for the how to talk

to girls category of
Trivial Pursuit.

00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:34.280
Say you just whacked Kelly
Ann Majors in the face

00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:37.660
with what's supposed
to be a bag of poop.

00:14:37.660 --> 00:14:41.230
Do you continue to pretend that
the bag is full of dog poop

00:14:41.230 --> 00:14:44.720
and thereby forever
create in her mind a link

00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:47.730
between you and dog poop?

00:14:47.730 --> 00:14:52.760 position:56%
Or cop to only pretending to pick up
dog poop and thereby forever create

00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:56.370
in her mind a link between
you and fake dog poop?

00:14:56.370 --> 00:15:00.540
I ended up doing something else
all together which was to trip

00:15:00.540 --> 00:15:01.940
over Bow Bow's leash and fall

00:15:01.940 --> 00:15:05.670
to the ground while saying
something suave like [inaudible].

00:15:05.670 --> 00:15:07.900
Loren and Kelly Ann leaned over me.

00:15:07.900 --> 00:15:09.600
Bow Bow wrapped the leash
around me one more time

00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:10.920
and began licking my face.

00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:13.230
Considering the last thing I
saw him doing with that tongue,

00:15:13.230 --> 00:15:15.800
I was not too excited about this.

00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:17.100
Are you okay, David?

00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:18.400
Asked Kelly Ann.

00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:19.700
I didn't mean to freak you out.

00:15:19.700 --> 00:15:21.000
She adjusted her hat.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.890
It was green, which make her
dark eyes more noticeable.

00:15:23.890 --> 00:15:27.120
He's fine, said Loren,
less sympathetically.

00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:29.240
She grabbed my hand
pulling me to my feet.

00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:30.750
You're so weird.

00:15:30.750 --> 00:15:33.180
The button girl, Kelly Ann said.

00:15:33.180 --> 00:15:35.350
That's Loren, I said.

00:15:35.350 --> 00:15:36.650
Kelly Ann pointed to my bag.

00:15:36.650 --> 00:15:41.440
I don't want to ask, but is
that dog -- I quickly decided.

00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:43.340
Fake dog poop was still
better than dog poop.

00:15:43.340 --> 00:15:46.270
Poop. I held up the bag
and let out a big laugh

00:15:46.270 --> 00:15:47.780
like the last thing
a person would have

00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:50.110
in a bag while walking
a dog was poop.

00:15:50.110 --> 00:15:53.970
No, no. It's pine cones.

00:15:53.970 --> 00:15:55.270
Pine cones?

00:15:55.270 --> 00:15:56.570
Kelly Ann shook her head.

00:15:56.570 --> 00:15:59.950
What are you carrying
pine cones in a bag for?

00:15:59.950 --> 00:16:01.650
Why indeed?

00:16:01.650 --> 00:16:05.410
I looked at Loren who gave me
the you're on your own look.

00:16:05.410 --> 00:16:08.660
Why am I carrying pine
cones in a plastic bag?

00:16:08.660 --> 00:16:10.700
I said, stalling for time.

00:16:10.700 --> 00:16:13.900
Yes. From the tone of her voice,
Kelly Ann was no longer worried

00:16:13.900 --> 00:16:15.290
about my physical well-being.

00:16:15.290 --> 00:16:18.590
It was my mental state
that was now in question.

00:16:18.590 --> 00:16:21.350
I looked at the Mason's house
which was across the street

00:16:21.350 --> 00:16:23.030
from grandma's house, and they
already started decorating

00:16:23.030 --> 00:16:24.690
for Christmas, which
is something people do

00:16:24.690 --> 00:16:26.060
around here on Thanksgiving day.

00:16:26.060 --> 00:16:27.990
Don't ask me why.

00:16:27.990 --> 00:16:29.350
For a wreath, I said.

00:16:29.350 --> 00:16:30.770
A pine cone wreath.

00:16:30.770 --> 00:16:32.170
A wreath? Yes.

00:16:32.170 --> 00:16:36.090
Because we're Jewish said
Loren not so helpfully.

00:16:36.090 --> 00:16:39.400
I gave her the evil eye
behind Kelly Ann's back.

00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:41.540
Hanukkah wreath, I mumbled.

00:16:41.540 --> 00:16:42.850
I'd never seen a Hanukkah wreath.

00:16:42.850 --> 00:16:44.570
Probably because they didn't exist.

00:16:44.570 --> 00:16:46.480
But it sounded like
something that could exist.

00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:48.620
The Abrams put up yellow
and blue Christmas lights

00:16:48.620 --> 00:16:50.700
and called them Hanukkah lights.

00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:52.170
Wait, said Kelly.

00:16:52.170 --> 00:16:53.830
I thought you were Chinese?

00:16:53.830 --> 00:16:55.330
I'm both, I said.

00:16:55.330 --> 00:16:57.180
You can be Chinese and
Buddhist or Chinese

00:16:57.180 --> 00:16:58.790
and [inaudible] or
Chinese and Jewish.

00:16:58.790 --> 00:17:01.000
I managed to stop laughing
before I paired being Chinese

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.110
with every religion on earth.

00:17:03.110 --> 00:17:06.010
But there aren't too many
Chinese Jews around here, I added.

00:17:06.010 --> 00:17:07.990
It almost felt like
a trivia question.

00:17:07.990 --> 00:17:10.210
How many Chinese Jews
live in Virginia?

00:17:10.210 --> 00:17:11.510
Answer, ha, ha, ha.

00:17:11.510 --> 00:17:13.810
What are you talking about?

00:17:17.100 --> 00:17:19.090
&gt;&gt; Madelyn Rosenberg: So
when we were both growing up,

00:17:19.090 --> 00:17:21.550
we grew up in different
parts of the state,

00:17:21.550 --> 00:17:25.980
and I was the only Jewish
kid in southwest Virginia.

00:17:25.980 --> 00:17:27.660
I mean, there were
a couple of others.

00:17:27.660 --> 00:17:30.110
There was Ezra Promutter [assumed
spelling], but it mostly felt

00:17:30.110 --> 00:17:32.140
like me and Ezra Promutter.

00:17:32.140 --> 00:17:36.250
And Wendy grew up in
northern Virginia with --

00:17:36.250 --> 00:17:41.340
actually one of the few Chinese
American kids growing up.

00:17:41.340 --> 00:17:46.940
So when we met, we sort of bonded
over the fact that we were only's.

00:17:46.940 --> 00:17:49.690
And I mean, we were a
lot more than just Jewish

00:17:49.690 --> 00:17:52.020
or just Chinese as everybody is.

00:17:52.020 --> 00:17:55.510
We're all multiple things,
but when we did our reading

00:17:55.510 --> 00:18:00.390
when we were kids, we were
trying to look for ourselves,

00:18:00.390 --> 00:18:04.340
and I did find myself
in a wrinkle in time.

00:18:04.340 --> 00:18:07.880
I saw myself in Meg or in
reading Harriet the Spy.

00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:09.180
I saw myself in Harriet.

00:18:09.180 --> 00:18:10.480
Wendy did too.

00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:11.780

&gt;&gt; Madelyn Rosenberg: All right.

00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:16.980
Awesome.

00:18:16.980 --> 00:18:18.280
[ Inaudible ]

00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:20.150
Cool. Well, this was the first book

00:18:20.150 --> 00:18:22.770
that I looked in, and
I saw a Jewish kid.

00:18:22.770 --> 00:18:24.970
And I thought, "Oh my gosh.

00:18:24.970 --> 00:18:26.930
This book is just like me.

00:18:26.930 --> 00:18:28.570
This girl is just like me."

00:18:28.570 --> 00:18:32.270
Even though I had never owned
a pentafore, and I didn't live

00:18:32.270 --> 00:18:35.700
in New York in the early 1900's.

00:18:35.700 --> 00:18:37.870
But just the fact that
she was the same religion

00:18:37.870 --> 00:18:41.210
of me made a huge difference.

00:18:41.210 --> 00:18:42.510
So --

00:18:42.510 --> 00:18:43.810 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Wendy Wan-Long Shang: And for me,

00:18:43.810 --> 00:18:45.710
that same book was
Blubber by Judy Bloom.

00:18:45.710 --> 00:18:48.160
Now, the main character in
Blubber is not Chinese American,

00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:50.160
but her best friend is.

00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:53.460
And she has kind of a side role in
the story, but that meant the world

00:18:53.460 --> 00:18:56.930
to me because I had never
seen in a book a portrayal

00:18:56.930 --> 00:19:00.200
of a Chinese American girl
who lived in modern times.

00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:01.920
And I think like subconsciously one

00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:03.560
of my other books is called
The Great Wall of Lucy Wu,

00:19:03.560 --> 00:19:05.040
and the main character's
name is Tracy Wu.

00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:10.910
And I think I was trying to
subconsciously connect them.

00:19:10.910 --> 00:19:12.510
&gt;&gt; Madelyn Rosenberg:
So when we were writing,

00:19:12.510 --> 00:19:14.670
we talked about being only's.

00:19:14.670 --> 00:19:18.080
And of course when we wrote
this book, we wrote it together.

00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:19.770
So we weren't only's anymore.

00:19:19.770 --> 00:19:21.400
And it's a lot less lonely.

00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:25.420
If anybody had seen my office and
how messy it is, it would be nice

00:19:25.420 --> 00:19:30.900
to get out of that office to
go write with somebody else.

00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:36.880
So this is me at my bar
mitzvah because little bits

00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:41.250
of our lives do show
up in this book.

00:19:41.250 --> 00:19:43.490
&gt;&gt; Wendy Wan-Long Shang: And this
is me when I was in high school

00:19:43.490 --> 00:19:47.210 position:56%
in the 80's, and I got the -- sorry.

00:19:47.210 --> 00:19:50.520
I was trying to do what
they called the preppy style

00:19:50.520 --> 00:19:52.740
so I had my sweater
over my shoulders.

00:19:52.740 --> 00:19:54.980
And what I drew from that
for David was David likes

00:19:54.980 --> 00:19:58.640
to do trivia contests, and
I did forensics contests.

00:19:58.640 --> 00:20:00.960
And I did the connection -- as you
know, we like to try new things

00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:04.560
and then get better at them, and
that's what David's trying to do.

00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:08.080
&gt;&gt; Madelyn Rosenberg: So the
day after was a television show.

00:20:08.080 --> 00:20:12.150
It was a movie made
for TV that aired

00:20:12.150 --> 00:20:16.690 position:56%
in the 80's, and it was super scary.

00:20:16.690 --> 00:20:21.910
It was about what life would be
like if a nuclear bomb went off,

00:20:21.910 --> 00:20:24.700
and for us, another
thing that was different

00:20:24.700 --> 00:20:28.010
about the 80's is there
was no Netflix and chill.

00:20:28.010 --> 00:20:30.350
We did not have that
many TV channels

00:20:30.350 --> 00:20:36.360
so everybody watched this show,
and it got us really scared.

00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:41.520
And so that fear, and what we found
that every decade of people --

00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:44.600
they're afraid of something
else and something different,

00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:47.280
but we've all gotten
through all of those decades.

00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:50.670
&gt;&gt; Wendy Wan-Long Shang: And then
one thing we hope you take away is

00:20:50.670 --> 00:20:54.320
that we can all be peacemakers
whether you start small at home

00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:57.460
or you try to extend to something
beyond just your backyard.

00:20:57.460 --> 00:20:58.760
We can all do stuff.

00:20:58.760 --> 00:21:00.910
So we also wanted to talk
about some of the other factors

00:21:00.910 --> 00:21:03.130
that went into the story.

00:21:03.130 --> 00:21:05.570
So we have food we talked about.

00:21:05.570 --> 00:21:06.870
We had dumplings and [inaudible].

00:21:06.870 --> 00:21:08.970
We talked about going to
different language schools.

00:21:08.970 --> 00:21:10.440
I went to Chinese school.

00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:13.890
Madelyn's kids go to Hebrew school.

00:21:13.890 --> 00:21:16.810
We talked about how we both had
this connection to Virginia.

00:21:16.810 --> 00:21:20.240
So all those things kind
of play into the story

00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:23.050
and then there's the
good old Trivial Pursuit.

00:21:23.050 --> 00:21:25.840
&gt;&gt; Madelyn Rosenberg: And also
friendship because the fact

00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:30.170 position:56%
that I think we were friends made a
really big difference in our ability

00:21:30.170 --> 00:21:33.230
to be able to write
and to write together.

00:21:33.230 --> 00:21:35.860
Do you want to talk about
that any [inaudible]?

00:21:35.860 --> 00:21:37.570
&gt;&gt; Wendy Wan-Long Shang: Well,
I have we have like one minute.

00:21:37.570 --> 00:21:39.830

00:21:39.830 --> 00:21:41.300

00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:46.060

and because we were the same age

00:21:57.750 --> 00:22:01.250
and we had kids the same age, we
kind of bonded over that and got

00:22:01.250 --> 00:22:02.850
to know each other better.

00:22:02.850 --> 00:22:04.640
And when we were writing this book,

00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:07.070
we got to know each
other better better.

he's talking about my book,

professional athletes in my book."

What works better for you?

I think I like having both actually

00:23:14.690 --> 00:23:18.230
because writing along is super
lonely, and what I love writing

00:23:18.230 --> 00:23:19.910
with you is when I
got tired of writing,

00:23:19.910 --> 00:23:22.590
I'd be like ping, here
Madelyn catch.

00:23:22.590 --> 00:23:25.310
What about you?

&gt;&gt; Madelyn Rosenberg: Great.

00:23:26.610 --> 00:23:30.890
One question a lot of people ask
us is how did you write together?

00:23:30.890 --> 00:23:34.170
Right? Because sometimes you're
trying to decide what movie

00:23:34.170 --> 00:23:39.200 position:56%
to go see or you're trying to decide
what restaurant to go to for dinner,

00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:40.710
you argue with the other person.

00:23:40.710 --> 00:23:45.860
Right? So how do you
argue over 250 pages?

00:23:45.860 --> 00:23:50.680
But it actually worked
really well for us.

00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:52.090
Basically, we took turns.

00:23:52.090 --> 00:23:57.280
You got to talk really, really
loud because we can't hear you.

00:23:57.280 --> 00:24:01.260

way up here and talk to us.

of the books I come back

to is a series called The Great
Brain, and it's about a boy growing

up in Utah in the 19th century,

00:24:16.350 --> 00:24:17.900
and their lives were
so different from ours.

and I love horses.

was The Phantom Told This
