00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.139
Life is all about balance.

00:00:02.139 --> 00:00:07.239
You want to have a balanced bank account,
balanced diet, balance between work and play,

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:10.879
and a healthy inner ear to keep you from falling
down all the time.

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:13.539
And lots of things can mess up that balance.

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:19.760
One bad night at the cheesecake factory and you might wake up with your finances, social life, and health out of whack.

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:24.280
In science, our word for balance is equilibrium.
You've heard of it.

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:28.800
When the balance of some natural system gets
disrupted, we say that it's out of equilibrium,

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:34.140
but that's not always a bad thing, because
nature usually finds a way to restore the balance.

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.440
Like if a population of deer in a forest suddenly
goes nuts

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:40.840
and there's too many of them, they'll run
out of food and space,

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:46.260
and predators will move in and the population will usually fall back to where the habitat can sustain it.

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.260
Likewise, there's no reason that I can't enjoy
the occasional hot pocket

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.809
without destroying my so-called balanced diet,

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.120
I just have to be sure to eat something that wasn't prepared in a salty lard factory to balance it out.

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.380
We tend to think of chemical reactions as
having a beginning and an end:

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:04.460
you start with some reactants, some chemistry happens, and you end up with the products, and that's that.

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:09.740
But that's not that, because you don't usually
end up with pure products.

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:15.640
Many chemical reactions seek balance too,
and just like us, they have to work through
the stress in order to find it.

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:25.020
[Theme Music]

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:30.420
It's common, because it's usually helpful, to think of chemical reactions as simple straightforward processes,

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.120
but in reality, many reactions never finish.
Ever.

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:40.720
When reactants react to form products, what we usually mean when we talk about chemical reactions,

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:43.560
it's technically called the forward reaction.

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:49.720
But sometimes, there's an opposite reaction that occurs with the products changing back into the reactants.

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:51.920
We call this a reverse reaction.

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:54.329
Now, exactly what kind of reactions do this,
and why,

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:58.279
is hard to describe without busting out some
200 level chemistry kung fu,

00:01:58.279 --> 00:02:04.259
but it all goes back to our lesson about Gibb's
free energy and reactions that occur spontaneously.

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:08.680
Reactions are reversible when they can go forward or backward without any extra energy being used.

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:13.890
Remember, this isn't just one reaction happening
once, it's billions and trillions of reactions,

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.780
and some of them might be going one way while
others are going another way.

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:21.420
And when the forward and reverse reactions occur at the same rate, that's called chemical equilibrium.

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:27.540
And even though we all like the idea of balance in our lives, in this case it's not always a desirable thing.

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:33.360
In fact, most chemists make their living using
tricks to prevent chemical equilibrium,

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:38.860
to knock it out of whack, maximizing the concentrations
of the chemicals they want to produce

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:42.550
at the expense of the balance that nature
usually seeks.

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:47.530
For example, consider the Haber process for
making ammonia from nitrogen in the air.

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:50.310
When we discussed it as a redox reaction a
few weeks ago,

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:55.860
we described it as a one way, complete reaction because that's all we needed to understand right then.

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:58.680
But I was lying to you.

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.060
Sorry, I'd rather you hear it from me than
out on the streets.

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:05.740
Turns out, the reaction really exists as an
equilibrium.

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:10.600
As nitrogen and hydrogen react to form ammonia,
the concentration of those gases drops,

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:16.200
making them less likely to collide and keep reacting, so the rate of the forward reaction slows down.

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:19.040
At the same time, the concentration of ammonia
rises.

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:23.370
More ammonia molecules are available to break
up into the reactant gases.

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:26.520
And surprise, the rate of the reverse reaction
speeds up.

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:30.850
Eventually, those processes reach a point
where they happen at the same rate.

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:35.140
At that point, there's no discernible change
in the concentration of any gas.

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:37.310
Nitrogen and hydrogen keep combining to form
ammonia,

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:40.560
while ammonia keeps breaking down into nitrogen
and hydrogen at the same time.

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.390
Notice that I did not say that the reaction
stops.

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:48.430
The reaction basically never stops, it's just
that we don't notice any changes at that point,

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:53.440
because everything that happens in one direction is perfectly balanced out by what happens in the other direction.

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:58.840
That's why reactants like this are written with a double arrow, indicating that the process runs both directions.

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:02.060
Like if I stand on a balanced board, I never
stop moving.

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:05.790
I just shift my body back and forth to compensate
for the motion of the board.

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:10.980
When it moves left, I move right and vice versa, and by doing that, I'm able to stay upright, hopefully.

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:15.160
But sometimes there is, if you will, a disturbance
in the force,

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:18.689
and as any good Jedi knows, those things must
be put right.

00:04:18.689 --> 00:04:23.629
Chemical equilibria can be disturbed by changes
in the concentration of one or more substances

00:04:23.629 --> 00:04:25.810
or by changes in temperature or pressure.

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:29.150
We describe these changes based on which way
they force the equilibrium.

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:33.770
We say a change shifts the reaction to the
right if it tends to make more products form

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:36.789
and to the left if it tends to make more reactants
form.

00:04:36.789 --> 00:04:42.800
This was all summarized nicely by a French chemist named Henry Louis Le Châtelier who was born in Paris in 1850.

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:45.860
Today, we call call his summary Le Châtelier's
Principle,

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:49.580
and it says that if stress is placed on a
system that is at equilibrium

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:53.220
the system will proceed in a direction that
minimizes the stress.

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:54.759
That can happen in several ways.

00:04:54.759 --> 00:04:58.069
For starters, changing the concentration of
any substance in a reaction

00:04:58.069 --> 00:05:01.719
causes it to proceed in whatever direction
restores the former balance.

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:07.000
For example, once the Haber reaction is at equilibrium if you were to add more nitrogen gas to the mix

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.700
the existing hydrogen would have more nitrogen
to react with.

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:13.120
Thus, it would begin forming more ammonia,

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:18.050
sending the reaction noticeably to the right
until the reaction balances itself again.

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:20.479
Removing some of the ammonia would have the
same effect.

00:05:20.479 --> 00:05:23.110
There would be less ammonia available to break
down,

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:27.969
so the formation of the ammonia would temporarily
exceed the formation of nitrogen and hydrogen,

00:05:27.969 --> 00:05:31.569
and the reaction would again shift to the
right until the balance is restored.

00:05:31.569 --> 00:05:34.180
Now here's an ironic side of irony served
up for you.

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:40.900
In 1901, Le Châtelier tried to invent a process for fixing nitrogen to make ammonia from nitrogen and hydrogen.

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:47.120
But he gave up the effort after the experiment caused a huge explosion that killed one of his lab assistants.

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:49.770
8 years later, the German chemist, Fritz Haber,

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:55.460
probably the closest the world ever got to a literal evil genius, did just what Le Châtelier was trying to do.

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:58.759
And in contrast to Le Châtelier's despair
at the death of his assistant,

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:03.520
Haber had no problem at all with the fact that his procedure now known as the Haber Process

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:08.900
was used to make chemical explosives which killed hundreds of thousands of people in World Wars I &amp; II.

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:11.800
But just to prove that there aren't clear
winners or losers in science,

00:06:11.809 --> 00:06:15.240
the Haber Process also saved uncounted millions
of lives

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:19.360
because the ability to fix nitrogen has made
chemical fertilizers possible,

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:21.680
and basically revolutionized modern agriculture.

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:24.659
Haber was awarded the 1918 Nobel Prize for
his discovery,

00:06:24.659 --> 00:06:27.949
but 30 years later he was considered by many
to be a war criminal

00:06:27.949 --> 00:06:33.150
and spent his last years as an object of shame
to his family and hatred for many others.

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:37.569
Le Châtelier, meanwhile despite his great
contributions to our understanding of equilibrium,

00:06:37.569 --> 00:06:43.200
considered his failure to find an efficient method for making ammonia to be the greatest blunder of his scientific career.

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:45.159
One of the key achievements that Haber made
was

00:06:45.159 --> 00:06:49.789
figuring out a way to continuously remove
ammonia as it was being produced.

00:06:49.789 --> 00:06:54.119
This allowed the forward reaction to keep
going faster than the reverse reaction.

00:06:54.119 --> 00:06:57.259
Basically preventing the process from reaching
a state of equilibrium.

00:06:57.259 --> 00:07:02.369
But changing concentrations is only one part
or actually one third of the story.

00:07:02.369 --> 00:07:04.059
There's also pressure to consider.

00:07:04.059 --> 00:07:06.349
When you look at the equation for the Haber
Process, for example,

00:07:06.349 --> 00:07:10.509
you can see that 4 moles of gas react to form
2 moles of gas.

00:07:10.509 --> 00:07:15.169
So the forward reaction decreases the volume
while the reverse reaction increases it.

00:07:15.169 --> 00:07:16.420
This is important.

00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:22.020
Increasing the pressure will then put more stress on the high volume reactants than the low volume products,

00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:25.900
so the reaction shifts to the right, producing
more ammonia than it does at low pressure.

00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:31.500
And indeed, the industrial Haber Process is
done at two hundred atmospheres of pressure.

00:07:31.509 --> 00:07:33.589
Decreasing the pressure, meanwhile, has the
opposite effect.

00:07:33.589 --> 00:07:38.029
The reaction precedes in the direction that
raises the pressure back to where it was before.

00:07:38.029 --> 00:07:39.749
In this case that's the break-down of ammonia.

00:07:39.749 --> 00:07:41.789
Toward the left where there are 4 moles of
gas.

00:07:41.789 --> 00:07:44.599
Solids and liquids aren't affected by pressure
as much,

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:49.440
so the more gasses that are present in the reaction, the greater effect any pressure change will have.

00:07:49.449 --> 00:07:54.399
The third and final way to affect the position
of equilibrium is with temperature changes.

00:07:54.399 --> 00:07:56.199
It gets a bit complicated up in here,

00:07:56.200 --> 00:08:00.340
but basically the thing to keep in mind is that endothermic reactions, which consume heat,

00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:05.700
are favored if heat is added so higher temperatures
tend to feed endothermic reactions.

00:08:05.710 --> 00:08:10.759
And by the same token, exothermic reactions,
which release heat fair better at low temperatures.

00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:17.000
And since exothermic reactions produce heat, that heat tends to favor the reverse endothermic reactions.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.740
So if heat is added to reaction, it forces
the reaction back to the left.

00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:25.460
But if heat is removed by cooling the reaction mixture, the reaction will proceed to the right.

00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:30.260
Now, you may be wondering since battling equilibrium
is what most chemists do for a living,

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:32.260
how they work out the specifics of it.

00:08:32.270 --> 00:08:36.680
How do they determine how much of each substance
is present, or how much they need to add,

00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:40.120
or what the temperature or pressure should
be when everything is constantly changing.

00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:44.260
You probably won't be surprised to learn that
there is math we can do to answer those questions.

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:46.870
We'll get into the numbers in our next lesson.

00:08:46.870 --> 00:08:48.650
But right now, let's have some fun.

00:08:48.650 --> 00:08:53.210
I've been talking about the Haber Process because it's a simple reaction, it's an important reaction.

00:08:53.210 --> 00:08:56.310
And because it's one of the main reactions
that Le Châtelier studied.

00:08:56.310 --> 00:08:58.170
But it's not very interesting to watch.

00:08:58.170 --> 00:09:03.840
A much more interesting reaction involves 2 different ions of cobalt that reach equilibrium in an endothermic reaction.

00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:08.640
As you can see, one of the ions is pink in
aqueous solution and the other is blue.

00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:11.830
One stress I can put on this system is the
addition of hydrochloric acid.

00:09:11.830 --> 00:09:16.940
This increases the chloride ion concentration and pushes the reaction to the right, the blue side.

00:09:16.940 --> 00:09:21.230
And if I add water, the reaction is pushed
right back to the left, pink. Cool, right?

00:09:21.230 --> 00:09:24.060
I can also stress the reaction by changing
its temperature.

00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:28.460
If I raise the temperature, it's like adding a reactant so the reaction will proceed to the right.

00:09:28.460 --> 00:09:30.100
You use it up and turn blue again.

00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:32.200
You can probably guess by now that if I lower
the temperature

00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:36.720
it's like taking away some reactants so the
reaction proceeds to the left and turns pink.

00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:41.330
We could make these colors go back and forth
all day by making changes to the reaction,

00:09:41.330 --> 00:09:43.570
but I think you're getting the idea.

00:09:43.570 --> 00:09:45.240
Equilibrium isn't about staying the same all
the time,

00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:48.790
it's just about keeping your balance as your
circumstances change.

00:09:48.790 --> 00:09:51.940
And now it is time for me to go get a nice
Greek salad to help balance out

00:09:51.940 --> 00:09:54.700
the corn dogs that I may or may not have eaten
this weekend.

00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:57.620
But first thank you for watching this episode
of Crash Course Chemistry.

00:09:57.620 --> 00:10:01.870
If you paid attention, you learned that equilibrium
is just a fancy word for balance,

00:10:01.870 --> 00:10:05.470
which is a thing that chemical reactions need
just as much as we do.

00:10:05.470 --> 00:10:10.380
And that the way they achieve balance is to
compensate for change, not just to stop completely.

00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:15.850
You also learned and saw that chemical equilibrium
can be affected by the concentration of substances

00:10:15.850 --> 00:10:19.110
their temperatures, and if they're gasses,
their pressure.

00:10:19.110 --> 00:10:22.630
Finally, you learned about Le Châtelier's
principle of chemical equilibrium

00:10:22.630 --> 00:10:26.340
and about his failed attempt to do what Fritz
Haber eventually did.

00:10:26.340 --> 00:10:28.870
Invent an efficient process to produce ammonia.

00:10:28.870 --> 00:10:31.590
