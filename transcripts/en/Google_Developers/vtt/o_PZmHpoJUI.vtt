00:00:11.155 --> 00:00:16.299
VINT CERF: Today, I want to rant
about the Internet of Things.

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:17.840
MALE SPEAKER: Have
any of you thought

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:21.341
about what the living room
of the future will look like?

00:00:21.341 --> 00:00:23.640
MALE SPEAKER: This isn't
just another web service.

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.770
These devices are in your
home, your office, car.

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:27.780
They can record data.

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:28.808
They can control things.

00:00:28.808 --> 00:00:30.432
MALE SPEAKER: All of
this put together,

00:00:30.432 --> 00:00:32.369
what it allows us
to do is really

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.315
to build the next generation
of intelligent applications.

00:00:35.315 --> 00:00:37.481
MALE SPEAKER: And the
opportunity is pretty immense.

00:00:37.481 --> 00:00:39.837
MALE SPEAKER: This is where you
guys come into play in figuring

00:00:39.837 --> 00:00:40.918
out what can be done.

00:00:40.918 --> 00:00:43.160
MALE SPEAKER: So without
further ado, let's dive in.

00:00:51.921 --> 00:00:53.170
MALE SPEAKER: Hello, everyone.

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:55.370
Welcome to a session entitled
"The Future of the Living

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:55.590
Room."

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.140
MALE SPEAKER: So what
we thought we'd do

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:58.590
is have a session
where we can sit down

00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:59.964
with some of the
important people

00:00:59.964 --> 00:01:01.182
on the Brillo and Weave team.

00:01:01.182 --> 00:01:03.390
MALE SPEAKER: And this is
my personal favorite recipe

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.019
for a very specific
use case, a recipe

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:06.630
for building one of something.

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.446
It's kind of a bag of goodies
to make app dev easier.

00:01:09.446 --> 00:01:11.154
MALE SPEAKER: What we
want to do is build

00:01:11.154 --> 00:01:12.735
a home that's [INAUDIBLE].

00:01:12.735 --> 00:01:15.780
MALE SPEAKER: This is all
about new paradigms for HCI.

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.570
You can develop
services in the language

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.850
that best fits the
problem at hand.

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:24.850
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:33.317 --> 00:01:35.650
FEMALE SPEAKER: We're really
excited to see what you can

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:37.450
build with Brillo and Weave.

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:39.300
Thank you.
