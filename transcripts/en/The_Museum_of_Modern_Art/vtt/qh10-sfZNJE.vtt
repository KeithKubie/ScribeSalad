00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.210
This exhibition assembles more than a hundred
works of art

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:15.020
made by Abstract Expressionist artists in
the 1940s, 50s, and 60s.

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:16.020
What's amazing to me is

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.510
they all come from the collection of this
museum.

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:23.680
For me, it was very important to do this exhibition
--

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:25.490
for two reasons.

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:28.740
One is the sheer pleasure and the sheer, I
felt,

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.890
importance of, fifty or sixty years later,

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.550
looking again at Abstract Expressionism.

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.140
It's become something so identified with New
York

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:39.880
and with MoMA (The Museum of Modern Art),

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:43.010
and something that we take for granted -- almost
as much

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:45.920
as we take something like French Impressionism
for granted.

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.630
Like, "Oh yes, those beautiful landscapes
by Monet."

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:52.360
And I thought, over the last year or two,

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:54.430
that this is painting and sculpture

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:57.080
that we need to look at again,

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:59.360
and -- now that it's the 21st century --

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:02.580
see what of it really carries forward

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:05.820
its message into this next century.

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:06.920
It's been a long time now

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.259
since that work got a serious reconsideration.

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:12.869
I think it's going to be exhilarating, frankly,

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.340
to see the power of these objects in the galleries
--

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:22.369
the ambition, the sheer majesty and grandeur
of this art --

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:25.770
because that's very much what its creators
wanted it to be,

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.390
is something that is knocking my socks off,

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:30.579
anyway, all over again.

00:01:30.579 --> 00:01:34.429
But the other reason that I wanted to do this
exhibition

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:40.020
is to point out to our visitors that what
you normally see

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.770
at The Museum of Modern Art,

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.229
you're seeing the tip of an iceberg.

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:47.909
The real Museum of Modern Art is not

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.689
what you see on the walls and the galleries

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:51.600
when you're walking through as a visitor.

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.549
The real Museum of Modern Art is in our drawing
center,

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:57.679
in our print center, in our photography study
center,

00:01:57.679 --> 00:02:01.399
where there are just hundreds and thousands
of works of art

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:03.829
that we've collected over the decades,

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:08.289
but that obviously there isn't a space to
show on a regular basis.

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:12.750
So for me, this is actually quite a thrilling
opportunity

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.010
to have our visitors get the chance

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:19.090
to walk through what is actually, in total,

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:23.799
25,000 square feet worth of gallery space
--

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:26.340
all devoted to one subject --

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:30.580
that people can immerse themselves in, can
really dig into.

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:33.360
Instead of just seeing the normal two or three
paintings

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.440
by Mark Rothkoe, see ten paintings by Mark
Rothkoe.

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.560
Instead of just seeing the big names like
Mark Rothkoe

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:45.590
or Jackson Pollock, see works by artists such
as

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:50.980
Jack Tworkov, William Baziotes, Grace Hartigan,
Lee Krasner --

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:54.470
people who were incredibly important at that
time,

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:59.379
and who had major, major impact on their peers.

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:01.360
And yet, over time, their names

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.549
have not been remembered as well.

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:05.930
The Museum of Modern Art is often very closely

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:08.319
identified with Abstract Expressionism.

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:12.970
We were on hand for Abstract Expressionism's
birth.

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:15.150
In small part, at least, one can say,

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:18.560
because MoMA did exist, and because MoMA was
here

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:21.620
to show that art from the first half of the
century

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:25.790
by European greats, such as Matisse and Picasso
--

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:28.170
to young artists at work in New York.

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:31.049
Although we are so closely identified

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:32.890
with Abtract Expressionism today --

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:36.069
(And, indeed, our collection is the richest
in the world.)

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:39.840
-- in the beginning, this museum was

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:43.079
slow to come to Abstract Expressionism.

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:45.541
It was not obvious at the end of the 40s that

00:03:45.541 --> 00:03:48.709
this was a movement that had some kind of
coherence,

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:51.989
and was going to be as great, if not greater,

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:55.140
than these earlier European avant gardes.

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:56.909
We did buy a painting by a Pollock --

00:03:56.909 --> 00:03:59.209
a painting by Pollock -- from his first show

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:02.689
at the Peggy Guggenheim Gallery in 1943.

00:04:02.689 --> 00:04:05.459
And we made other historic purchases like
that.

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:07.810
In fact, our first Rothkoe painting,

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:09.969
which was offered as a gift from a trustee,

00:04:09.969 --> 00:04:14.079
(Philip Johnson, the architect, in fact, in
1952)

00:04:14.079 --> 00:04:17.920
caused another trustee to resign in disgust.

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:20.030
The early trustees and the early audience

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:23.730
was not necessarily ready for Abstract Expressionism.

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:27.110
And so I think the curators were conscious
of that,

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:29.910
and wanted to take it slow.

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:32.520
In 1958, we organized an exhibition

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:34.500
called 'The New American Painting.'

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:37.020
It toured to eight countries in Europe.

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:40.060
The influence of that exhibition was enormous
on painters

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:45.280
in France, Switzerland, England, Spain, Italy,
etc.

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:48.350
And when that exhibition was done with its
tour,

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:50.800
it came back and was here at MoMA in 1959
--

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:52.850
'The New American Painting.'

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:59.930
And that kind of sealed the movement as a
great,

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:03.110
important art historical phenomenon of the
20th century.
