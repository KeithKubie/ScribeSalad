00:00:10.236 --> 00:00:13.236
&gt;&gt;Coach Dick: I was a girls'
basketball coach here for 16 years,

00:00:13.236 --> 00:00:17.886
and in the fall of '99, I found

00:00:17.886 --> 00:00:21.496
that the school was
thinking about an EAST lab.

00:00:22.076 --> 00:00:25.926
When my manager told me what
EAST was, I said, "Well,

00:00:25.926 --> 00:00:27.476
what does the facilitator do?"

00:00:27.476 --> 00:00:29.746
And he said, "Keeps kids off porn."

00:00:30.246 --> 00:00:33.196
And so I thought, "Well,
I could do that."

00:00:33.636 --> 00:00:34.856
&gt;&gt;Good evening, I'm Krystle Payne.

00:00:35.006 --> 00:00:37.576
&gt;&gt;And I'm Logan Pratt and here
are tonight's top stories.

00:00:37.876 --> 00:00:40.446
&gt;&gt;Coach Dick: And obviously,
it became much more than that.

00:00:40.686 --> 00:00:44.896
It's the most innovative, educational
movement there has ever been,

00:00:45.066 --> 00:00:45.726
in my opinion.

00:00:46.056 --> 00:00:50.556
&gt;&gt;Both: And remember, stay in
class, EAST, and good night.

00:00:50.636 --> 00:00:53.206
&gt;&gt;Coach Dick: I was old-school,
I was a science teacher,

00:00:53.206 --> 00:00:56.596
and I decided what the kids were
going to learn, when they were going

00:00:56.596 --> 00:00:58.486
to learn it, how they were going
to learn it, and which side

00:00:58.486 --> 00:00:59.916
of the paper they were
going to put their names

00:00:59.916 --> 00:01:01.456
on when they turned it in.

00:01:01.976 --> 00:01:05.356
I was a little bit more of
a liberal basketball coach

00:01:05.356 --> 00:01:08.736
and I didn't run a lot of set
offenses, but I was old-school.

00:01:09.016 --> 00:01:11.616
I felt like I needed
to be in control.

00:01:12.516 --> 00:01:17.466
And the concept of EAST did not
lend itself to that, and it was hard

00:01:17.466 --> 00:01:20.486
for me to get over, but
it was also exciting.

00:01:21.036 --> 00:01:24.776
&gt;&gt;You did good, people [Laughter]

00:01:26.306 --> 00:01:28.146
&gt;&gt;Coach Dick: There's
a trigger, I think,

00:01:28.216 --> 00:01:32.796
that clicks in where the students
realize the opportunity they have.

00:01:32.886 --> 00:01:34.416
&gt;&gt;So, where do you want me to stand?

00:01:34.576 --> 00:01:37.206
&gt;&gt;Coach Dick: Once they get into
a project and they see the results

00:01:37.206 --> 00:01:39.656
of the project, there's
usually no holding them back.

00:01:40.026 --> 00:01:41.436
They finish one.

00:01:41.436 --> 00:01:43.436
They're ready to go on to another.

00:01:43.686 --> 00:01:47.386
The beauty of EAST is we're
allowed to use real-world,

00:01:47.386 --> 00:01:52.156
industry-grade technology to go out
and do projects, and if we fail,

00:01:53.026 --> 00:01:56.696
we fail, but it's not like
they're out in the working world.

00:01:56.696 --> 00:02:00.636
They have the opportunity to stretch
their legs and see what they can do.

00:02:01.466 --> 00:02:03.776
These kids don't learn
something because they have to

00:02:03.776 --> 00:02:05.476
and then put it back
on a test and lose it.

00:02:05.966 --> 00:02:08.116
When they finish their
learning, they have it.

00:02:08.376 --> 00:02:09.156
They take it with them.

00:02:09.296 --> 00:02:11.176
&gt;&gt;And all those rooms
are the same size, right?

00:02:13.056 --> 00:02:13.446
&gt;&gt;Yes.

00:02:14.346 --> 00:02:16.956
&gt;&gt;Coach Dick: They understand
that what they're going out there

00:02:17.036 --> 00:02:19.876
to do is going to be
used in the public.

00:02:19.996 --> 00:02:22.496
It's going to be seen by
the public, and it's going

00:02:22.496 --> 00:02:24.266
to be judged by the public.

00:02:25.136 --> 00:02:27.736
That creates high expectations
in itself.

00:02:28.166 --> 00:02:31.266
&gt;&gt;Cobra EAST students find new
creative ways to integrate technology

00:02:31.266 --> 00:02:33.296
in their projects in order
to benefit the community.

00:02:33.296 --> 00:02:36.106
&gt;&gt;Coach Dick: The Founder's
Award is an optional competition

00:02:36.106 --> 00:02:39.326
that celebrates everything
that the lab does over a year,

00:02:39.946 --> 00:02:43.476
and we have to do that into a
presentation that is informative,

00:02:43.476 --> 00:02:45.396
concise, and, hopefully,
entertaining.

00:02:45.806 --> 00:02:51.866
&gt;&gt;Cool! I don't think I need
to say anymore, do I [Laughter]

00:02:52.226 --> 00:02:54.656
&gt;&gt;Coach Dick: These kids are
extremely hard on themselves

00:02:54.656 --> 00:02:59.626
and critical, and when they come
out throwing high-fives and excited

00:02:59.626 --> 00:03:01.496
and doubling over, you
know they've nailed it.

00:03:02.196 --> 00:03:05.036
So this is one of my
special times, I'll tell you.

00:03:05.546 --> 00:03:06.926
This is what I come to work for.

00:03:07.186 --> 00:03:09.156
&gt;&gt;It's really great.

00:03:10.296 --> 00:03:10.556
&gt;&gt;Go EAST [Laughter]!
