00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
And the correct answer is this: we'll see an error message, but the quote

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
messes up our HTML,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
And let's see that happen, together.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
We said the quote was going to mess up our HTML--

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
let's submit the form

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
and here we go.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
We've got our error message, but the string that I answered

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
was: bar"&gt;what

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
and "what" appeared outside of our text box.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Now it's not too tricky to see why this happened.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
What happened was this string here--

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
this Python string--doesn't know it's HTML

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
and when we entered in a quote

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
in our string, Python substituted a quote in the middle of here

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
and then I also put an angle bracket in,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
and that closed the tag.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
And then the other string that I typed appeared outside here.
