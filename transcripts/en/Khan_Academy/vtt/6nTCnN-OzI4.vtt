00:00:00.384 --> 00:00:01.382
- [Voiceover] So in the last video,

00:00:01.382 --> 00:00:05.839
we talked about the year 1864
in the American Civil War,

00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:09.692
and now we're getting down
to the very end of the war.

00:00:09.692 --> 00:00:13.109
In 1864, William Tecumseh Sherman had his

00:00:13.997 --> 00:00:16.806
sort of famous march to the sea,

00:00:16.806 --> 00:00:20.563
where he captured Atlanta and
then carried on a total war

00:00:20.563 --> 00:00:23.932
through the state of Georgia to Savannah,

00:00:23.932 --> 00:00:26.325
and from Savannah he turns north

00:00:26.325 --> 00:00:29.928
and starts heading to the forces of Grant,

00:00:29.928 --> 00:00:33.145
so he can back him up in a
final victory against Lee,

00:00:33.145 --> 00:00:36.379
who has encamped in Richmond.

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:40.546
Meanwhile, Abraham Lincoln
wins the election of 1864,

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.770
and is ready to bring this war to a close.

00:00:47.077 --> 00:00:49.318
So let's move on to 1865.

00:00:49.318 --> 00:00:52.456
A lot happens very quickly in 1865,

00:00:52.456 --> 00:00:54.275
starting with, in January,

00:00:54.275 --> 00:00:56.234
Congress passed the 13th Amendment.

00:00:56.234 --> 00:01:00.317
The 13th Amendment outlawed
slavery for all time.

00:01:01.314 --> 00:01:05.397
It's clear that when the
south is brought back in

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.720
to the United States, it is
going to be brought back in

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.672
without slavery, there
is no option for slavery

00:01:11.672 --> 00:01:14.577
in the United States going forward.

00:01:14.577 --> 00:01:18.744
Now Grant, after his incredible
victory in Tennessee,

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:25.301
in Vicksburg, has been going
after Lee's army in Virginia.

00:01:25.301 --> 00:01:29.234
Now Lee has holed up in
Richmond and eventually,

00:01:29.234 --> 00:01:31.873
he realizes his forces
can't stay there anymore,

00:01:31.873 --> 00:01:35.056
they can't hold the city, so
in the beginning of April,

00:01:35.056 --> 00:01:38.884
they evacuate Richmond and on April 3rd,

00:01:38.884 --> 00:01:42.858
the United States forces occupy Richmond.

00:01:42.858 --> 00:01:44.923
Abraham Lincoln himself actually goes down

00:01:44.923 --> 00:01:46.943
to visit Richmond, which
he'd never been to before,

00:01:46.943 --> 00:01:51.143
and he even goes to the
government building in Richmond

00:01:51.143 --> 00:01:54.997
where Confederate President
Jefferson Davis had governed,

00:01:54.997 --> 00:01:57.418
and goes into his office.

00:01:57.418 --> 00:02:01.891
He's there less than 48 hours
after Davis himself had left.

00:02:01.891 --> 00:02:06.381
And then events, after that,
events take place very quickly.

00:02:06.381 --> 00:02:09.419
So Lee falls back from
Richmond to Petersburg,

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:12.504
and Grant is kind of
marking him the whole time,

00:02:12.504 --> 00:02:16.254
and they retreat across
Virginia to the west,

00:02:17.267 --> 00:02:19.261
Lee is probably heading for Lynchburg,

00:02:19.261 --> 00:02:23.428
and Grant manages to catch
up with him at Appomattox.

00:02:26.854 --> 00:02:29.385
At first, Lee thinks that he's actually

00:02:29.385 --> 00:02:31.213
going to fight at Appomattox,

00:02:31.213 --> 00:02:33.280
and then he realizes he just does not

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.882
have the men necessary, so
he invites Grant to come

00:02:37.882 --> 00:02:42.154
and have a parlay for
surrender, and they meet,

00:02:42.154 --> 00:02:45.567
this is actually a picture
of Lee outside the house

00:02:45.567 --> 00:02:48.178
in Appomattox courthouse, Virginia,

00:02:48.178 --> 00:02:49.904
where he surrendered the Army of

00:02:49.904 --> 00:02:52.431
Northern Virginia to Grant.

00:02:52.431 --> 00:02:55.546
Now that is not the actual
end of the Civil War,

00:02:55.546 --> 00:02:59.850
but it's kind of the end
for all intents and purposes

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:02.578
because Lee is the General-in-Chief

00:03:02.578 --> 00:03:05.047
of the Confederate Armies.

00:03:05.047 --> 00:03:08.476
Grant is likewise for the United States.

00:03:08.476 --> 00:03:10.419
And after this point, it's just gonna be

00:03:10.419 --> 00:03:12.539
kind of a matter of
time until all the rest

00:03:12.539 --> 00:03:15.651
of the Confederate armies surrender.

00:03:15.651 --> 00:03:18.809
So there's great celebration
in Washington, D.C.,

00:03:18.809 --> 00:03:23.336
everyone is very happy, finally
this four year long war,

00:03:23.336 --> 00:03:26.919
where 620,000 Americans
have died, is over,

00:03:29.212 --> 00:03:32.280
and Abraham Lincoln
goes and gives a speech,

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:35.408
talking about what Reconstruction
is going to be like.

00:03:35.408 --> 00:03:39.575
And in this speech, he lays
out that African Americans,

00:03:40.542 --> 00:03:43.259
after the Civil War, are
going to have citizenship,

00:03:43.259 --> 00:03:45.862
at least some of them,
and the right to vote,

00:03:45.862 --> 00:03:48.883
which is in keeping with
everything that he's really said

00:03:48.883 --> 00:03:51.298
since the Emancipation Proclamation.

00:03:51.298 --> 00:03:53.312
But what he does not
know, is that this man,

00:03:53.312 --> 00:03:56.747
John Wilkes Booth, is
in the crowd that day,

00:03:56.747 --> 00:03:59.146
listening to him, and
when he hears Lincoln say

00:03:59.146 --> 00:04:01.557
that African Americans are
gonna have citizenship,

00:04:01.557 --> 00:04:03.069
they're gonna have the right to vote,

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:05.385
he vows to kill Lincoln.

00:04:05.385 --> 00:04:07.746
John Wilkes Booth is really
interesting character,

00:04:07.746 --> 00:04:10.751
we only know so much about him.

00:04:10.751 --> 00:04:13.722
He himself was a famous actor, in fact,

00:04:13.722 --> 00:04:16.499
Lincoln had seen him
perform a number of times,

00:04:16.499 --> 00:04:19.834
and liked him, even invited
him to the White House,

00:04:19.834 --> 00:04:21.437
cause he thought he was a great actor,

00:04:21.437 --> 00:04:24.593
but Booth refused to go and see Lincoln.

00:04:24.593 --> 00:04:27.308
And he was from a family of famous actors,

00:04:27.308 --> 00:04:29.540
I think kind of a modern-day equivalent

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:31.998
might be the Sheen family.

00:04:31.998 --> 00:04:35.811
Booth had a famous brother
who was also an actor,

00:04:35.811 --> 00:04:38.918
and a famous father who was also an actor,

00:04:38.918 --> 00:04:42.380
just like Martin Sheen's
sons are Emilio Estevez

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:44.301
and Charlie Sheen today.

00:04:44.301 --> 00:04:47.135
So this would be like, if
Emilio Estevez or Charlie Sheen

00:04:47.135 --> 00:04:49.258
suddenly decided to murder the President,

00:04:49.258 --> 00:04:51.640
which would be a pretty
incredibly big deal,

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:53.481
just as it was then.

00:04:53.481 --> 00:04:55.611
Booth was a Confederate sympathizer,

00:04:55.611 --> 00:04:59.469
and almost certainly a Confederate spy

00:04:59.469 --> 00:05:02.052
who had gone up to Canada at some time

00:05:02.052 --> 00:05:06.923
to plot some movement on
behalf of the Confederacy.

00:05:06.923 --> 00:05:11.570
He was an outright racist,
I think the part where

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:14.166
Lincoln said African Americans
would have citizenship

00:05:14.166 --> 00:05:16.327
was what pushed him over the edge

00:05:16.327 --> 00:05:18.459
into assassinating Lincoln.

00:05:18.459 --> 00:05:22.037
Originally he had actually
planned to kidnap Lincoln,

00:05:22.037 --> 00:05:25.873
and ransom him for the
end of the Civil War,

00:05:25.873 --> 00:05:30.095
but after Lee surrenders,
Booth's plan changes.

00:05:30.095 --> 00:05:32.469
He wants to basically
decapitate the government,

00:05:32.469 --> 00:05:35.483
so he conspires with a
couple of other people,

00:05:35.483 --> 00:05:38.834
and they plan that they're going to kill

00:05:38.834 --> 00:05:41.657
all the highest people
in government at once.

00:05:41.657 --> 00:05:43.431
So they're going to kill Lincoln,

00:05:43.431 --> 00:05:45.606
they're going to kill General Grant,

00:05:45.606 --> 00:05:48.412
they're going to kill William Seward,

00:05:48.412 --> 00:05:49.696
the secretary of state,

00:05:49.696 --> 00:05:52.846
and they're going to kill Andrew Johnson,

00:05:52.846 --> 00:05:53.984
the Vice-President.

00:05:53.984 --> 00:05:55.610
And Booth thinks that perhaps,

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:57.887
in this moment of panic that follows

00:05:57.887 --> 00:06:02.231
the decapitation of the entire
United States government,

00:06:02.231 --> 00:06:05.857
that perhaps something positive
for the south with happen.

00:06:05.857 --> 00:06:08.223
Remember, they had hoped
that getting rid of Lincoln

00:06:08.223 --> 00:06:12.146
in the election of 1864
might result in putting

00:06:12.146 --> 00:06:14.675
a government more favorable to the south

00:06:14.675 --> 00:06:16.911
in office to the north,
which didn't happen,

00:06:16.911 --> 00:06:20.459
so perhaps Booth wants to
do the same thing this time.

00:06:20.459 --> 00:06:23.375
So Booth reads in the
newspaper that Abraham Lincoln

00:06:23.375 --> 00:06:26.980
is going to be attending
a play at Ford's Theater

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:28.063
that evening.

00:06:30.266 --> 00:06:33.422
And Booth is a regular at Ford's Theater,

00:06:33.422 --> 00:06:35.605
in fact, he even has his
mail delivered there,

00:06:35.605 --> 00:06:37.760
so it's kind of his home away from home.

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:40.339
And when Booth goes to the theater

00:06:40.339 --> 00:06:42.289
with the intent to kill Lincoln,

00:06:42.289 --> 00:06:44.865
he pretty much just goes
up to Lincoln's box,

00:06:44.865 --> 00:06:46.280
and everyone knows who he is,

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:48.433
and they say hi John,
and he just walks on by,

00:06:48.433 --> 00:06:49.880
walks right into Lincoln's box,

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:51.861
shuts the door behind him,

00:06:51.861 --> 00:06:54.576
and shoots Lincoln through
the back of the head.

00:06:54.576 --> 00:06:58.101
At that point, he jumped on
the stage from the booth,

00:06:58.101 --> 00:07:01.892
which is maybe 14 feet above the stage.

00:07:01.892 --> 00:07:03.677
If you've never been to Ford's Theater

00:07:03.677 --> 00:07:06.326
and you have an opportunity,
I highly recommend you go,

00:07:06.326 --> 00:07:09.806
it's a really interesting
museum and historical place,

00:07:09.806 --> 00:07:11.923
and in the process, he
actually breaks his ankle,

00:07:11.923 --> 00:07:14.891
so in his running away he's dealing with

00:07:14.891 --> 00:07:18.235
this broken ankle and
eventually he is captured,

00:07:18.235 --> 00:07:21.902
and refuses to be taken
alive, so he is killed.

00:07:21.902 --> 00:07:25.462
And later the rest of the
conspirators are hanged

00:07:25.462 --> 00:07:28.216
for their participation in this plot.

00:07:28.216 --> 00:07:30.801
There's some confusion
over what Booth said

00:07:30.801 --> 00:07:33.556
when he jumped out of the box.

00:07:33.556 --> 00:07:37.723
A lot of people say that he
yelled sic semper tyrannis,

00:07:39.133 --> 00:07:42.839
which means, thus always to tyrants,

00:07:42.839 --> 00:07:46.756
and is also the motto of
the state of Virginia.

00:07:47.637 --> 00:07:50.166
Other people heard him say
things like I've done it,

00:07:50.166 --> 00:07:54.076
or revenge for the south,
but sic semper tyrannis

00:07:54.076 --> 00:07:57.181
is kind of the famous phrase
that has come out of this.

00:07:57.181 --> 00:07:59.367
So Booth is calling Lincoln a tyrant,

00:07:59.367 --> 00:08:02.457
and tyrants are eventually
always assassinated.

00:08:02.457 --> 00:08:04.870
The rest of the assassination plot

00:08:04.870 --> 00:08:07.691
from that evening mostly failed.

00:08:07.691 --> 00:08:10.111
One of the conspirators, Lewis Powell,

00:08:10.111 --> 00:08:12.992
did manage to get in to
William Seward's house

00:08:12.992 --> 00:08:16.427
and stab him, he did not
succeed in killing him,

00:08:16.427 --> 00:08:19.239
but he did wound Seward very badly.

00:08:19.239 --> 00:08:21.543
The rest of the assassination plots

00:08:21.543 --> 00:08:23.815
did not come to fruition whatsoever.

00:08:23.815 --> 00:08:26.626
One thing you'll notice
is that only a few parts

00:08:26.626 --> 00:08:29.204
of the Confederate Army
have actually surrendered

00:08:29.204 --> 00:08:31.404
at the time of Lincoln's assassination.

00:08:31.404 --> 00:08:33.802
So the war is, in some
cases, still ongoing,

00:08:33.802 --> 00:08:38.207
particularly in North Carolina,
in Raleigh and Durham,

00:08:38.207 --> 00:08:41.788
where Sherman's forces have come up

00:08:41.788 --> 00:08:43.599
through South Carolina and North Carolina

00:08:43.599 --> 00:08:47.311
to meet the forces of
Confederate General Joe Johnston.

00:08:47.311 --> 00:08:49.567
And it's on April the
26th that Joe Johnston

00:08:49.567 --> 00:08:52.841
surrenders to William Tecumseh Sherman.

00:08:52.841 --> 00:08:55.186
From that point forward, there
are a few dribs and drabs

00:08:55.186 --> 00:08:58.853
of other armies that
are still surrendering.

00:08:59.868 --> 00:09:04.035
Interesting fact, the last
Confederate unit to surrender

00:09:04.887 --> 00:09:08.319
actually surrendered in November of 1865,

00:09:08.319 --> 00:09:10.873
in Liverpool, England,
this was a Confederate ship

00:09:10.873 --> 00:09:12.525
that had been sailing around,

00:09:12.525 --> 00:09:14.205
and when they finally came into port,

00:09:14.205 --> 00:09:15.794
they officially surrendered.

00:09:15.794 --> 00:09:17.491
Now after Lincoln's assassination,

00:09:17.491 --> 00:09:20.586
which was an incredible
shock to the United States,

00:09:20.586 --> 00:09:22.721
remember that no President had ever

00:09:22.721 --> 00:09:24.670
been assassinated before,

00:09:24.670 --> 00:09:27.893
the power is then transferred
to Andrew Johnson,

00:09:27.893 --> 00:09:30.569
Lincoln's Vice-President.

00:09:30.569 --> 00:09:34.022
And Johnson's Presidency
is going to end up

00:09:34.022 --> 00:09:36.975
being very problematic
for a number of reasons,

00:09:36.975 --> 00:09:39.229
the most important of which being that

00:09:39.229 --> 00:09:40.990
he's very sympathetic to the south.

00:09:40.990 --> 00:09:43.502
With Johnson in power as President,

00:09:43.502 --> 00:09:46.612
he's going to have a
considerable amount of conflict

00:09:46.612 --> 00:09:49.858
with the American Congress,
which is dominated

00:09:49.858 --> 00:09:53.628
by radical Republicans who
think that Lincoln himself

00:09:53.628 --> 00:09:57.245
was not nearly punitive
enough toward the south.

00:09:57.245 --> 00:10:00.487
There's going to be just an
incredible battle of wills

00:10:00.487 --> 00:10:03.381
between Congress and
Johnson that's going to end

00:10:03.381 --> 00:10:06.095
with Johnson being the
first American President

00:10:06.095 --> 00:10:07.884
to be impeached.

00:10:07.884 --> 00:10:11.857
And so thus endeth the Civil
War of the United States,

00:10:11.857 --> 00:10:14.248
with the north victorious.

00:10:14.248 --> 00:10:17.612
The southern states come
back into the Union.

00:10:17.612 --> 00:10:19.951
The rebellion in the south is defeated,

00:10:19.951 --> 00:10:24.538
slavery has ended, and the
era of states rights is over.

00:10:24.538 --> 00:10:26.043
In the next video I'd like to talk,

00:10:26.043 --> 00:10:27.320
just for a few moments,

00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:31.013
about the big takeaways
about the American Civil War.

00:10:31.013 --> 00:10:32.885
What is is that makes it so important?

00:10:32.885 --> 00:10:34.672
And what were the lasting effects?

00:10:34.672 --> 00:10:37.523
I'll get to that in the next video.
