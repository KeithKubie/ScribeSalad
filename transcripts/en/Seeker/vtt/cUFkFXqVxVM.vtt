00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.380
I’ve got a thousand unread emails, dozens
of books I never got around to, and my friends

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.680
just won’t stop sharing interesting articles
Well, some of them are interesting.

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:16.920
Is speed reading the life hack to finally
catch up on all of it?

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.860
Hello viewers, Julian for DNews.

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:22.670
If you’re like you, you probably prefer
watching a video to reading an article and

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:24.970
you’re what keeps the lights on here at
DNews.

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:25.970
But me?

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:26.970
I’d rather read.

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:32.250
But I have a problem: I am achingly, painfully,
devastatingly slow at it.

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.710
I actually took a test while researching this
and I read at 270 words per minute.

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:39.940
that’s 8% better than the national average,
hooray!

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:45.120
But according to the test the average college
student is at 450 words per minute.

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.789
Whenever I tell people this the response is
always the same: Have you thought about learning

00:00:48.789 --> 00:00:49.789
to speed read?

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:54.510
Now there are even apps that promise to double
my speed with the wonders of technology.

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.980
It sounds too good to be true, how does it
work???

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:59.879
Well first off there are a few different methods
to up your words per minute count.

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.800
One of the most common methods advocated by
speed readers is to eliminate your tendency

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:07.950
for sub-vocalization, which is when the little
voice in your head that pronounces all the

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:08.950
words...

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:09.950
By the way whose voice is that anyway?

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:10.960
I know it’s not my own.

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.570
I’m going to start reading in Morgan Freeman’s
voice.

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:18.020
Anyway after you eliminate the sub-vocalization
there are a couple of other techniques speed

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:19.020
readers use.

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.300
There’s following the text with your finger
or a pencil to keep you focused on where you’re

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:26.500
reading, there’s skimming, and there’s
taking in large chunks of text at a glance.

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:30.270
Speed readers claim they can surpass 1500
words per minute with these methods.

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.690
But according to research not funded by people
selling speed reading courses, their comprehension

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:36.270
really starts to suffer.

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.760
One study tested 16 speed readers and found
they couldn’t understand more than 75% of

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:43.360
what they were reading at over 600 words per
minute.

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:48.110
Obviously skimming is going to hurt your comprehension
and retention, so what about the other methods?

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:51.490
Trying to take in big chunks of text using
your peripheral vision and without moving

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:53.850
your eye isn’t really possible.

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.409
Keith Rainer, a psychologist who pioneered
eye-tracking technology, explains that your

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:02.750
fovea, the area in your retina where vision
is sharpest, needs to be focused on a word

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:03.750
to take it in.

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.280
You can only take in four or five letters
with 100% accuracy, and letters outside the

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.970
fovea’s view become much harder discern
pretty quickly.

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:15.620
Even the most basic step of eliminating sub-vocalization
can really hurt your comprehension if the

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:16.900
text is complicated.

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.111
Now there are apps that promise to make reading
quick and painless.

00:02:20.111 --> 00:02:23.420
Many of them involve flashing the words at
you to eliminate your eye’s need to track

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:24.610
across the page.

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:28.440
The apps claim their studies show no loss
in comprehension, but they’re not letting

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.140
anyone see the research.

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:32.860
This is what’s known in the scientific community
as a red flag.

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:36.890
I’ve actually tried an app or two like this
and I can get up to about 600 words per minute,

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:41.430
but it’s exhausting to keep up and if I
miss a word the whole operation falls apart.

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.120
Rayner is on my side on this point, saying
reading this fast can overload your working

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.120
memory.

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:49.270
Plus you don’t get the chance to chew on
an idea and really understand it.

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:53.330
So it looks like I’m just going to do what
I’ve always done; light some candles, settle

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:56.270
into the bath, and have some quality time
with a good book.

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:18.569
Maybe being a slow reader isn’t such a bad
thing.
