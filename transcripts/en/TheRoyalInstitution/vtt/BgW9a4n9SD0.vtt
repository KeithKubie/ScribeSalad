00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:03.320
Wow!

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:12.600
That is amazing! Wow! It's by magic!

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.980
If I've got this right, I should be
able to balance

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.840
this on top of this. Let's have a go.

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:36.960
Wonderful.

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:43.140
 I can even give a nudge and it
remains completely balanced.

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.160
However, I take this sweet off and eat it,

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.240
it goes all horribly wrong.

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:52.240
Making sculptures like this

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:56.129
is a great fun activity to do with your 
children and it can also provide them

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:57.820
with an opportunity to investigate

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:01.520
balance and stability.

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:10.320
Right girls, here's a challenge:

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.659
See this piece of carrot? I want to see if you can balance this carrot on this stick 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:20.279
on top of the bottles. Can you balance it?

00:01:20.279 --> 00:01:21.380
No!

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:25.340
Then try this one.

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.380
Doesn't really work too well, does it? Why don't you think it's working?

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:32.620
Um, it's a bit bumpy?

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:36.460
So what about trying to poke the stick into the carrot at some point?

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:39.740
Be careful because the pointy end is a bit sharp.

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.370
It's exactly the same really. It's not helping.

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:48.710
Here's one that we made a little bit earlier.

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:51.830
Shall we have a go and see if this balances? Okay!

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:55.770
It's the same carrot, same stick with a bit of an uneven end.

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.250
Let's see if we can balance it.

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:04.050
Aha! Do you want to have a go, see if you can make one like that?

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:13.100
Wow! Hooray! 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:17.720
Hooray! One, two...

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:23.260
Yay! It's by magic isn't it! But how can they do it?

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.750
Is it because of the weight?

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.410
And where is the weight? Is it at the bottom or the top?

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:32.230
At the bottom and the top.

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.230
Look at this!

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:42.660
That is amazing! How many are there!?

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:43.900
One two three four...

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:45.770
When you have an object like a pencil,

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:49.960
and try to balance it on your finger, it balances when it's roughly in the middle.

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:53.150
This point is called the centre of mass, or the centre of gravity.

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:56.150
You can think of it as the point at which

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:00.510
the mass or weight of an object is evenly distributed.

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:03.980
For this pencil, you can see

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:07.970
that it is approximately in the middle. Oops!

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:11.960
But for some objects, like a hammer,

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:15.080
obviously a hammer is much heavier at one end then the other,

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:17.620
so if you try to do it in the middle there's no way it would work, 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:21.130
so the centre of mass is much nearer

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:25.640
the heavier end. I find this quite tricky because I've got small fingers!

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:29.180
But for an object like this roll of masking tape

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:31.360
the weird thing is that the center

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:34.160
of mass is not within the object itself. 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:35.730
That seems a bit weird doesn't it?

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:39.650
But if I put my finger under here you can see it roles off

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:43.840
very easily. That's because center of
gravity is right in the middle of the

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:48.700
object and it's hard to get it directly
above my finger.

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:51.959
It wants to roll off either way. But if I put my finger here,

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:56.090
as you all know from experience, dead easy to balance it!

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:58.710
The centre of gravity is right here, underneath.

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:01.100
That's the secret to making a successful 

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:04.650
balancing sculpture. To make sure the centre of mass

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:08.100
is underneath the point at which is
being balanced

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:11.380
on the object.

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:17.840
If it's tipping over to this side a bit too much, what do you think you might need to do?

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:20.760
The balloon's lighter than the sweet!

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:23.660
You can change the centre of mass of a balancing sculpture

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:25.960
by adjusting the position of the various 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:30.430
bits and pieces we put together to make it.

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:37.080
That's really good, sweetheart!

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:41.480
Wow, look, it balances!

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:44.620
Well done, darling, that's amazing!

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:47.900
Understanding the science of stability and how things balance

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:51.860
is important for lots of things like
designing a building or making a sports car.

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:56.320
Obviously today we haven't done anything quite as complicated as that,

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:59.940
but these sculptures are a fantastic way 

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:04.960
to start your children thinking about
some of those concepts.
