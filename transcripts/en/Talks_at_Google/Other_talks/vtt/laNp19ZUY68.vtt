FEMALE SPEAKER: Hello, everyone.

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:03.854
Welcome to Talks at Google.

00:00:03.854 --> 00:00:05.700
Today it's my absolute
pleasure to welcome

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.540
Mars Hallman, the winner
of the 2015 GLSEN Respect

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:10.620
Award for the Student
Advocate of the Year.

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.460
And Stephanie
Frosch, who you might

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:14.760
know as ElloSteph from YouTube.

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:16.129
Thanks both for being here.

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:17.206
STEPHANIE FROSCH: Thank
you for having us.

00:00:17.206 --> 00:00:18.622
FEMALE SPEAKER:
Round of applause.

00:00:18.622 --> 00:00:20.400
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.020
So I'm going to start off by
talking about gender pronouns,

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:26.580
because that's what one does.

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.252
I think it's an important thing,
because I think it's something

00:00:29.252 --> 00:00:31.710
that maybe the public doesn't
always wrap their head around

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.810
easily, but it's important
to the people who

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:36.590
want to be identified
maybe not as "he,"

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:37.930
"she," or anything in between.

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:40.110
So Mars, I'm going to
let you take this one.

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.526
Can you explain
to us a little bit

00:00:41.526 --> 00:00:43.250
about how you prefer
to be referred to?

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:44.640
And the reasoning for that?

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:45.260
MARS HALLMAN: All right.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:46.843
I use the pronouns
"they," "them," and

00:00:46.843 --> 00:00:49.230
"theirs," because they
don't have the gender

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.689
connotation of "he," "him,"
"his," or "she," "her," "hers."

00:00:51.689 --> 00:00:54.188
And you use it in the same way
you would if you were talking

00:00:54.188 --> 00:00:55.340
in the third person plural.

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:56.874
It's very simple.

00:00:56.874 --> 00:00:58.790
FEMALE SPEAKER: And the
reasoning for that is?

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:59.480
MARS HALLMAN: They're
important to me.

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:00.830
I'm non-binary.

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:04.234
And they reaffirm my gender
identity when people use them.

00:01:04.234 --> 00:01:06.650
FEMALE SPEAKER: And just can
you explain what "non-binary"

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:08.471
is for our viewers out there.

00:01:08.471 --> 00:01:10.470
MARS HALLMAN: I'm not a
boy, and I'm not a girl,

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.380
and I'm not anything in between.

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:14.410
FEMALE SPEAKER: Wonderful.

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:17.120
So Mars, you are the Student
Advocate of the Year.

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:20.790
Can you talk about what some
of the process of becoming

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.680
an advocate for the LGBTQ,
everyone in-between, community

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:26.920
was like for you?

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.670
MARS HALLMAN: Well, my process
was being the Q in LGBTQ.

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:35.644
Growing up as the Q, you see a
lot of bullying and inequality

00:01:35.644 --> 00:01:38.060
and harassment, and you see
that happening to your friends

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:39.640
and to yourself.

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:43.750
And you grow up and you
become strong from that,

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:47.260
and you-- I grew up having the
privilege of having parents who

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.010
support me and having
a safe place at home

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:50.810
knowing my friends
don't have that.

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:52.577
I know that school
and the workplace

00:01:52.577 --> 00:01:54.660
are the places that are
going to be safe for them.

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:57.872
So I know that I have to make
those places safe for them.

00:01:57.872 --> 00:02:00.080
FEMALE SPEAKER: And you led
an effort at your school,

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:01.610
in particular, to
kind of make sure

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:04.950
that there were
bathrooms that were

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.490
appropriate for
anybody who didn't

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:07.782
want to identify as either one.

00:02:07.782 --> 00:02:09.573
Can you talk about some
of the other things

00:02:09.573 --> 00:02:11.920
that you kind of took
care of along the way that

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:13.829
helped create this safe space?

00:02:13.829 --> 00:02:16.120
MARS HALLMAN: Well, I started
the Gay-Straight Alliance

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:17.870
at my school, the first
one in the region.

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:19.194
Woo.

00:02:19.194 --> 00:02:20.300
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.860
And that itself was a struggle.

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:30.190
Getting support from local
parents wasn't going to happen,

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:32.290
so we got a sponsor.

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.460
I spoke myself to the principal.

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:36.920
I got the resources from GLSEN
and from the Gay-Straight

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.750
Alliance Network and
proposed the club.

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:46.230
And it was deferred to a
school board meeting decision,

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.940
which was then deferred.

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:50.700
And they announced
through the paper

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.089
that it was going to be allowed.

00:02:52.089 --> 00:02:53.630
So the Gay-Straight
Alliance started.

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:56.180
We had our first
meetings recently.

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:58.030
Actually, at the
start of Ally Week.

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.800
FEMALE SPEAKER: Congratulations.

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:59.716
STEPHANIE FROSCH: Wow.

00:02:59.716 --> 00:03:02.430
MARS HALLMAN: So so far we've
the worked on educating people

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:05.070
on gender pronouns,
gender identities,

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:07.531
and done some just fun
activities making sure everyone

00:03:07.531 --> 00:03:10.030
knows that they're welcome at
school no matter who they are.

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:11.350
FEMALE SPEAKER: Awesome.

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:14.210
Steph, you have a larger
kind of platform to use.

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:16.152
You are a YouTube sensation.

00:03:16.152 --> 00:03:17.610
STEPHANIE FROSCH:
I do the YouTube.

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:19.780
FEMALE SPEAKER:
You do the YouTube.

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:22.120
Could you talk to us
about-- you definitely bring

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:24.570
kind of a positive air
and, like, an air of humor

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:27.570
to these issues that
I think we need.

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:29.930
You know, I think if
you get too caught

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:33.302
in the they're serious
issues, they're

00:03:33.302 --> 00:03:34.760
kind of sometimes
upsetting issues,

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:36.950
but you bring this very,
like, hey, it's OK.

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:37.450
It's fine.

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:38.344
It's fun.

00:03:38.344 --> 00:03:40.510
Can you talk about kind of
the process of developing

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:42.137
your voice online?

00:03:42.137 --> 00:03:43.720
STEPHANIE FROSCH:
Well, I started when

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:45.510
I was in high school on Tumblr.

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:47.730
And the reason why my
Tumblr sort of grew

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:49.860
was because at the
time it was very rare

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:54.160
finding a feminine lesbian
on the internet at my age.

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.290
I mean, this is 2011,
but at the same time,

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:58.650
it was like finding
a shiny Pokemon.

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:01.340
So that's how I grew
my audience on Tumblr.

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:03.076
And from there, I
would just write.

00:04:03.076 --> 00:04:04.950
I was very big into
writing, but eventually I

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:07.750
had a fan say, I really
love what you write,

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:08.652
but I hate reading.

00:04:08.652 --> 00:04:09.610
Could you make a video?

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:11.710
And I was like, I have
all this free time.

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:12.340
Why not?

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:15.220
So not having a life
actually paid off.

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:16.970
And it just kind
of grew from there.

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:19.719
And I realized that I started
getting more serious questions

00:04:19.719 --> 00:04:21.510
in regards to being
kicked out of your home

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:24.050
to things like wanting
to commit suicide.

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:27.554
And from there I wanted to be
more certified to answer those

00:04:27.554 --> 00:04:29.220
questions, because I
felt like I wasn't.

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:31.920
So I got my certification
in suicide prevention.

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:35.830
And I was on the board
for LGBTQ+ services

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:36.710
at my university.

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:38.410
And from there I
was like, how can I

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:41.432
include entertainment
and these issues

00:04:41.432 --> 00:04:42.640
that I'm so passionate about?

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:46.200
So a way that I see it is
like dipping a broccoli

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:46.980
in chocolate.

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:48.920
So one of my most
successful videos,

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:51.410
which is about
gender recognition

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:53.868
and sexuality recognition, is
called "Never Have I Ever,"

00:04:53.868 --> 00:04:55.826
which, you know, that
popular game "never, ever

00:04:55.826 --> 00:04:56.590
have I done this."

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:58.912
So it starts out
fun and cheerful,

00:04:58.912 --> 00:05:00.620
and then it gets into
more serious issues

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:01.510
with the statistics.

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:02.885
So I'm like, if
I can get someone

00:05:02.885 --> 00:05:06.480
to watch something and be
intrigued by it while still

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:08.565
learning and keeping
it at a lighter note,

00:05:08.565 --> 00:05:10.690
then I feel like you're
more likely to take that in

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:12.050
and more likely to be accepting.

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:13.650
And it's how we learn.

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:14.990
It's how we process.

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:17.760
But always in school,
you want to get an A

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:20.030
because the teacher
then congratulates you

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:21.770
not because the
teacher puts you down

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:23.050
for getting the answer wrong.

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:24.740
So I feel like that's
how society is.

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:26.740
FEMALE SPEAKER: It's very
carrot, not the stick.

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:27.699
STEPHANIE FROSCH: Yeah.

00:05:27.699 --> 00:05:29.406
FEMALE SPEAKER: You
made an amazing point

00:05:29.406 --> 00:05:31.920
where we do live in this kind
of wonderful era where maybe,

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:34.850
apparently even
four years ago, it's

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:36.712
tough to find someone
who maybe identifies

00:05:36.712 --> 00:05:37.670
in the same way you do.

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:40.870
You know, we're all individuals,
we're all different,

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:42.709
but if you grew up in
a small town, maybe,

00:05:42.709 --> 00:05:44.500
you don't necessarily
have those resources.

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:45.320
STEPHANIE FROSCH: Yeah.

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:46.736
FEMALE SPEAKER:
But, Mars, for you

00:05:46.736 --> 00:05:49.340
was the internet kind of playing
a role in your support system

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:51.670
and kind of getting your
efforts off the ground?

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:54.489
MARS HALLMAN: Yes.

00:05:54.489 --> 00:05:56.030
The internet is
where I first learned

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:59.370
about queer and
transgender issues

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:01.845
through just various support
groups and just databases.

00:06:01.845 --> 00:06:05.210
Just learning statistics.

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:07.270
I contacted the Gay-Straight
Alliance Network

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:08.280
through the internet.

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:09.900
A lot of Google searching.

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:13.680
And that's how I got in contact
with Anna Davis and Chris

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:16.730
Hampton of the
ACLU, and that was

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:18.980
where we got a lot of the
support for getting the GSA.

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:21.232
And just for learning
that it's OK to be me.

00:06:21.232 --> 00:06:22.940
FEMALE SPEAKER: Steph,
I think that's one

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:24.825
of the things you kind of
touch on in most of your videos

00:06:24.825 --> 00:06:25.620
is like, it's OK to be you.

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:26.552
It's OK to be whatever.

00:06:26.552 --> 00:06:28.927
STEPHANIE FROSCH: Yeah, because
oftentimes in small towns

00:06:28.927 --> 00:06:31.080
you don't have that
reassurance that it's OK.

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:33.820
And the internet is an
amazing outreach for that.

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:37.050
I mean, I went to a
religious private school

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:39.000
from kindergarten
to senior year,

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.120
or as I like to call
it "Jew school."

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:43.220
And it was great,
but at the same time,

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:47.070
I was the only a LGBTQ+
identified person.

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:49.390
So I had no resources.

00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:51.150
I had no one to go to.

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:53.920
But by simply typing
something into the internet,

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:54.840
I had a community.

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:55.690
I had the support.

00:06:55.690 --> 00:06:56.540
I had the outreach.

00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:59.240
And I feel like that's so
important for Millennials

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:01.820
and the new generations
today is we're so

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:05.312
connected now that no one
has to be alone anymore.

00:07:05.312 --> 00:07:07.520
FEMALE SPEAKER: Is that--
what's one thing you really

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:09.660
hope that your audience
takes away from your videos?

00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:11.160
Is it that is that
you're not alone?

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:11.860
Is it--

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:12.370
STEPHANIE FROSCH:
It's definitely

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:14.470
that they're not alone
and definitely how

00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:17.080
not everything in society
needs to be a taboo subject.

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:21.070
I mean, even back in the day,
my first college roommate

00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:24.136
was gender non-binary, and
they weren't comfortable even

00:07:24.136 --> 00:07:26.010
bringing it up in
conversation because people

00:07:26.010 --> 00:07:27.270
weren't talking about it.

00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:29.250
And I feel like the
more we talk about it

00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:32.220
and say it's OK to talk about
it, the less of a "big deal"

00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:33.030
it's going to be.

00:07:33.030 --> 00:07:35.070
It's going to be, oh,
these are your pronouns?

00:07:35.070 --> 00:07:35.580
Yeah?

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:36.579
Those are your pronouns.

00:07:36.579 --> 00:07:37.960
Versus what is this?

00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:40.540
And then making
a big deal of it.

00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:42.500
FEMALE SPEAKER: Mars,
you said something

00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:44.360
earlier that I enjoyed.

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:46.361
And you said, like,
Nashville isn't a bad place.

00:07:46.361 --> 00:07:47.860
And could you talk
a little bit more

00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:49.870
about that in terms of,
like, finding acceptance

00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:53.567
in the real world space
versus the internet?

00:07:53.567 --> 00:07:56.150
MARS HALLMAN: Well, I grew up
in a few different environments.

00:07:56.150 --> 00:07:58.730
I had a kind of a city
upbringing and a country

00:07:58.730 --> 00:07:59.580
upbringing.

00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:03.370
And then we moved to Nashville
a few years ago on purpose.

00:08:03.370 --> 00:08:04.760
We didn't think, oh, no.

00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:07.400
We've ended up in the
middle of nowhere.

00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:08.430
What will we do?

00:08:08.430 --> 00:08:10.630
There's a really
great community there

00:08:10.630 --> 00:08:16.460
with some very vocal people
who would oppose change.

00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:20.800
But also, when I started the GSA
and when I started campaigning

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:23.820
for equality in my school,
lots of adult allies,

00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:26.460
either from Nashville or who
still lived there or had moved

00:08:26.460 --> 00:08:29.940
away, came to me and
my mother with messages

00:08:29.940 --> 00:08:31.770
of support or thanks.

00:08:31.770 --> 00:08:34.840
Some of them would send monetary
contributions to the GSA,

00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:39.400
some of them would send their
words and their stories.

00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:43.385
So it's a good town
with good people.

00:08:43.385 --> 00:08:44.260
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:45.010
It's good to know.

00:08:45.010 --> 00:08:48.330
It's good to know that there's
support when you asked for it.

00:08:48.330 --> 00:08:51.704
I'd love to know-- this
is not-- unfortunately

00:08:51.704 --> 00:08:53.370
the internet is a
very supportive place,

00:08:53.370 --> 00:08:54.911
but the internet
can also be somewhat

00:08:54.911 --> 00:08:57.090
of a disrespectful place.

00:08:57.090 --> 00:08:59.120
And I think you both
probably deal very well

00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:01.199
with those types
of comments and are

00:09:01.199 --> 00:09:02.490
able to kind of brush them off.

00:09:02.490 --> 00:09:03.680
And what's some
advice you'd give

00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:05.240
to people who are
kind of dealing

00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:07.735
with the trolls of the internet?

00:09:07.735 --> 00:09:09.110
STEPHANIE FROSCH:
I mean, the way

00:09:09.110 --> 00:09:12.930
I see it, in life in general
you can't please everyone,

00:09:12.930 --> 00:09:14.850
regardless if it's on
or off the internet.

00:09:14.850 --> 00:09:17.210
There's always going to be
someone with a different view

00:09:17.210 --> 00:09:17.710
than yours.

00:09:17.710 --> 00:09:20.750
And although I see it as we
don't have the same views,

00:09:20.750 --> 00:09:22.910
I feel like we should
still respect it.

00:09:22.910 --> 00:09:24.370
And some people
don't respect it.

00:09:24.370 --> 00:09:27.040
So whenever I see a troll
or someone like that,

00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:29.090
I feel more sorry
for them because I'm

00:09:29.090 --> 00:09:31.670
like, if you're that
insecure, that's

00:09:31.670 --> 00:09:33.750
why you're fixating
on my life and what

00:09:33.750 --> 00:09:36.230
I'm doing because I
don't go out of my way

00:09:36.230 --> 00:09:37.470
to bring someone down.

00:09:37.470 --> 00:09:40.070
The only time that
you bring someone down

00:09:40.070 --> 00:09:42.624
is when you are
yourself falling,

00:09:42.624 --> 00:09:44.790
which is a struggle that I
feel that they deal with.

00:09:44.790 --> 00:09:46.570
So instead I just ignore them.

00:09:46.570 --> 00:09:49.920
I am fortunate where I don't
have a lot of "haters."

00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:51.930
I don't know if that's
a good or a bad thing,

00:09:51.930 --> 00:09:53.640
because it can bring discussion.

00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:55.010
It can bring awareness.

00:09:55.010 --> 00:09:57.500
And the ones that I
have had, it's just been

00:09:57.500 --> 00:09:59.700
very petty things like, wow.

00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:00.540
You're so gay.

00:10:00.540 --> 00:10:02.740
And I'm like, yeah.

00:10:02.740 --> 00:10:03.500
I am.

00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:05.680
Thank you for that observation.

00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:09.510
But just simply, like, viewing
it as not taking it personally,

00:10:09.510 --> 00:10:11.950
because oftentimes
it's their issue.

00:10:11.950 --> 00:10:13.844
And even in person,
those are the things

00:10:13.844 --> 00:10:15.260
that got to me the
most growing up

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:17.270
when I was called
slurs in high school

00:10:17.270 --> 00:10:19.940
when I was first out
about my orientation.

00:10:19.940 --> 00:10:22.899
My mom used to always
tell me that in even four

00:10:22.899 --> 00:10:25.440
years from now, four days from
now, it's not going to matter.

00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:27.652
And it's true.

00:10:27.652 --> 00:10:28.860
FEMALE SPEAKER: Very much so.

00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:30.231
Yeah.

00:10:30.231 --> 00:10:31.870
And you bring up your mom.

00:10:31.870 --> 00:10:34.352
Mars, your mother's
here with us today.

00:10:34.352 --> 00:10:35.810
Are there things
that you would say

00:10:35.810 --> 00:10:38.990
to kind of families in order
to-- what advice would you

00:10:38.990 --> 00:10:41.140
give to families
who maybe do have

00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:43.200
children who they don't
necessarily immediately

00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:43.700
understand?

00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:46.127
Like, what resources would
you try and point them to?

00:10:46.127 --> 00:10:48.460
Or what was the thing that
was also most helpful for you

00:10:48.460 --> 00:10:51.114
in dealing with your family
and your coming outs?

00:10:51.114 --> 00:10:52.530
MARS HALLMAN: Well,
one my parents

00:10:52.530 --> 00:10:55.360
were very open to
just listening to me.

00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:59.800
I would introduce a topic, and
whatever they could understand

00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:01.905
for me, you know, my
mom took the initiative

00:11:01.905 --> 00:11:06.750
and would look up GLSEN
or PFLAG resources.

00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:08.510
Just making sure that
your child's safety,

00:11:08.510 --> 00:11:12.780
and respecting your child's
safety, is number one always.

00:11:12.780 --> 00:11:14.950
To make sure that
your questioning

00:11:14.950 --> 00:11:18.710
them is for the benefit of
learning them as a person

00:11:18.710 --> 00:11:20.590
and not for trying
to change them.

00:11:20.590 --> 00:11:22.824
Make sure you're just
learning about them.

00:11:22.824 --> 00:11:24.240
STEPHANIE FROSCH:
My biggest thing

00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:28.050
is, especially-- my dad taught
me this, surprisingly enough.

00:11:28.050 --> 00:11:32.020
My dad is very old school,
but also very accepting.

00:11:32.020 --> 00:11:33.880
But the way that I
see it is I remember

00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:37.160
one time I had my college
roommate coming home after they

00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:39.140
first came out,
and I told my dad,

00:11:39.140 --> 00:11:41.530
you know, they go
by these pronouns.

00:11:41.530 --> 00:11:42.540
This is what you do.

00:11:42.540 --> 00:11:43.910
And he's just nodding along.

00:11:43.910 --> 00:11:46.060
And I asked him, are
you following this?

00:11:46.060 --> 00:11:47.990
And he said, you know,
I don't understand it,

00:11:47.990 --> 00:11:49.780
but that doesn't mean I'm
not going to respect it.

00:11:49.780 --> 00:11:51.380
And that's the way I
feel like it should be.

00:11:51.380 --> 00:11:53.588
You don't have to grasp
something and know everything

00:11:53.588 --> 00:11:55.510
about it right away
to validate a person

00:11:55.510 --> 00:11:57.910
and give them the respect
that they deserve.

00:11:57.910 --> 00:11:59.810
And a big thing that
I've also noticed

00:11:59.810 --> 00:12:03.170
is, especially from when I get
fan mail, a lot of the youth

00:12:03.170 --> 00:12:04.837
say how their parents
don't accept them.

00:12:04.837 --> 00:12:06.878
So that means they're
never going to accept them.

00:12:06.878 --> 00:12:08.410
They don't have
a family anymore.

00:12:08.410 --> 00:12:10.680
Which isn't true
either, and I feel

00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:13.470
like that's important to really
recognize that coming out

00:12:13.470 --> 00:12:15.760
is a process also for the
person hearing the news.

00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:17.660
So my dad, when
I first told him,

00:12:17.660 --> 00:12:20.240
it was very much of a we're not
going to bring this up ever.

00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:22.150
And now my dad is
super supportive.

00:12:22.150 --> 00:12:23.410
And it can change.

00:12:23.410 --> 00:12:24.850
Your parents can change.

00:12:24.850 --> 00:12:26.770
So I know so many
people are quick to say,

00:12:26.770 --> 00:12:28.020
I don't have a family anymore.

00:12:28.020 --> 00:12:28.530
It's done.

00:12:28.530 --> 00:12:30.590
But give them time.

00:12:30.590 --> 00:12:32.820
Parents are close to
perfect in our eyes,

00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:34.570
but everyone has growing room.

00:12:34.570 --> 00:12:37.470
And they can learn from
their children as well.

00:12:37.470 --> 00:12:39.803
FEMALE SPEAKER: I think that's
a wonderful kind of point

00:12:39.803 --> 00:12:43.070
and I think the
whole, it gets better,

00:12:43.070 --> 00:12:45.280
the kind of publicity
and awareness

00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:47.229
that the recent
movements have had

00:12:47.229 --> 00:12:48.770
have definitely been
helpful in that.

00:12:48.770 --> 00:12:51.490
And so it's nice to hear
that there are resources

00:12:51.490 --> 00:12:55.200
and there are outlets for people
who are willing to change.

00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:57.470
And I think everyone has
the capacity to change.

00:12:57.470 --> 00:12:59.240
STEPHANIE FROSCH: Yeah.

00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:00.990
FEMALE SPEAKER: What
is one of the moments

00:13:00.990 --> 00:13:03.150
that you're most proud of
in your kind of activism

00:13:03.150 --> 00:13:06.110
and careers?

00:13:06.110 --> 00:13:07.844
The award tonight?

00:13:07.844 --> 00:13:09.468
MARS HALLMAN: I'm
pretty proud of that.

00:13:09.468 --> 00:13:11.960
FEMALE SPEAKER: You should be.

00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:16.300
MARS HALLMAN: My proudest moment
would be back in junior year

00:13:16.300 --> 00:13:20.127
when it was the day I decided
that I was going to go through

00:13:20.127 --> 00:13:22.460
with making sure we had a
Gay-Straight Alliance before I

00:13:22.460 --> 00:13:24.270
graduated.

00:13:24.270 --> 00:13:28.370
One of my best friends
isn't out at home,

00:13:28.370 --> 00:13:31.860
isn't out to anyone,
everyone suspects,

00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:37.450
was being sexually harassed on
the daily by upper classmen.

00:13:37.450 --> 00:13:41.930
And it was because he
was perceived as queer.

00:13:41.930 --> 00:13:45.470
And for the first
time I responded

00:13:45.470 --> 00:13:51.050
to a situation levelheaded,
removed him, reported it.

00:13:51.050 --> 00:13:56.880
And that day when I got home,
I wrote up our guidelines,

00:13:56.880 --> 00:14:00.020
I recruited our sponsor,
and a week later we

00:14:00.020 --> 00:14:00.990
had a club in motion.

00:14:00.990 --> 00:14:04.460
Like, that's what I'm
proudest of is just response.

00:14:04.460 --> 00:14:06.570
FEMALE SPEAKER: OK.

00:14:06.570 --> 00:14:08.070
STEPHANIE FROSCH:
That's incredible.

00:14:08.070 --> 00:14:09.610
Sorry. [INAUDIBLE]
not from that.

00:14:09.610 --> 00:14:11.319
Am I allowed to have,
like, an online one

00:14:11.319 --> 00:14:12.193
and a non-online one?

00:14:12.193 --> 00:14:13.050
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yes.

00:14:13.050 --> 00:14:15.091
STEPHANIE FROSCH: I feel
like it's Hannah Montana

00:14:15.091 --> 00:14:17.070
with these two [INAUDIBLE].

00:14:17.070 --> 00:14:19.710
My favorite in-person
accomplishment is when I was

00:14:19.710 --> 00:14:22.927
on the board for LGBTQ+
services at my university.

00:14:22.927 --> 00:14:24.760
I went to the University
of Central Florida,

00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:27.470
and it's a student
body of 60,000.

00:14:27.470 --> 00:14:31.680
And we have a huge
LGBTQ+ population,

00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:35.770
but we had social clubs but
we need more than just social

00:14:35.770 --> 00:14:36.270
sometimes.

00:14:36.270 --> 00:14:38.240
So we were
literally-- our office

00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:41.650
was a closet in the student
union within someone else's

00:14:41.650 --> 00:14:42.300
office.

00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:45.300
And it was a great having
all six of us in this closet,

00:14:45.300 --> 00:14:46.812
but-- oh, we were in the closet.

00:14:46.812 --> 00:14:48.700
Look at that.

00:14:48.700 --> 00:14:50.620
But we were really
trying to make

00:14:50.620 --> 00:14:52.960
a safe space, which
we did accomplish,

00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:54.590
called Pride Commons.

00:14:54.590 --> 00:14:57.750
And we had several meetings with
the whole student government.

00:14:57.750 --> 00:15:01.150
It was a real struggle
to get our needs met,

00:15:01.150 --> 00:15:04.540
but eventually we got
an entire huge room

00:15:04.540 --> 00:15:07.540
in the middle of our university
where there's resources.

00:15:07.540 --> 00:15:09.430
We partnered up with
victim services.

00:15:09.430 --> 00:15:12.240
We had an entire legal
team so if a student wanted

00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:13.930
to change their name,
then all of that

00:15:13.930 --> 00:15:16.180
would be taken care of, like,
free of charge for them.

00:15:16.180 --> 00:15:17.680
And that's definitely
the biggest

00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:19.020
in-person accomplishment.

00:15:19.020 --> 00:15:22.250
And then online I feel like
it's a victory every day

00:15:22.250 --> 00:15:26.030
when I get a message from
someone, again, saying hi.

00:15:26.030 --> 00:15:28.870
Four years ago I thought
it would not get better.

00:15:28.870 --> 00:15:31.760
I thought that my life was
over, but you told me this.

00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:32.992
And now I'm doing this.

00:15:32.992 --> 00:15:33.950
Now I'm at this school.

00:15:33.950 --> 00:15:35.030
Now I have this partner.

00:15:35.030 --> 00:15:37.380
Now I have this
relationship with my peers.

00:15:37.380 --> 00:15:40.240
And just seeing a huge
growth in someone,

00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:42.520
even if I never met
them face-to-face,

00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:46.630
getting to really feel how their
life is significantly better

00:15:46.630 --> 00:15:49.610
is-- there's no words for it.

00:15:49.610 --> 00:15:51.120
FEMALE SPEAKER: Wonderful.

00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:52.980
You both very much
inspire others,

00:15:52.980 --> 00:15:55.846
but I'd love to know
who inspires you.

00:15:55.846 --> 00:15:56.970
STEPHANIE FROSCH: Oh, gosh.

00:15:56.970 --> 00:15:59.300
This is so hard.

00:15:59.300 --> 00:16:01.120
FEMALE SPEAKER: Like a pop quiz.

00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:03.578
STEPHANIE FROSCH: Is it-- I
don't want to be stereotypical,

00:16:03.578 --> 00:16:04.680
but I love Ellen.

00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:07.300
And it's not just because
she rocks blazers,

00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:09.510
as I hope to one day,
but it's because I

00:16:09.510 --> 00:16:13.032
feel like her entire
energy is about positivity.

00:16:13.032 --> 00:16:14.240
And that's what I want to do.

00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:16.370
So even through
negative situations,

00:16:16.370 --> 00:16:17.330
things can get better.

00:16:17.330 --> 00:16:20.602
And I remember, especially
after my mom passed away

00:16:20.602 --> 00:16:22.560
during my senior year of
high school, something

00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:24.327
that I would have in
common with my mom

00:16:24.327 --> 00:16:25.660
is she watched the "Ellen Show."

00:16:25.660 --> 00:16:28.480
So what made me feel
better is seeing, like,

00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:30.060
old "Ellen Shows"
and just seeing

00:16:30.060 --> 00:16:32.679
how even though something
terrible can happen,

00:16:32.679 --> 00:16:34.470
you don't have to
pretend it didn't happen.

00:16:34.470 --> 00:16:35.630
You don't have to
pretend it's better.

00:16:35.630 --> 00:16:37.020
But you can grow from it.

00:16:37.020 --> 00:16:39.380
You can make something
positive afterwards.

00:16:39.380 --> 00:16:41.910
And just remember that
every negative experience

00:16:41.910 --> 00:16:43.790
isn't a wall that's blocked.

00:16:43.790 --> 00:16:45.840
The road keeps going,
and you can change

00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:47.440
the direction it goes in.

00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:49.410
So Ellen is a very
big inspiration

00:16:49.410 --> 00:16:52.360
for me along with a really
close friend of mine

00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:53.560
named Raymond Braun.

00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:59.130
He does a lot of the advocacy
and online marketing for, like,

00:16:59.130 --> 00:17:00.361
the-- oh, my goodness.

00:17:00.361 --> 00:17:02.694
I'm, like, blanking right now
and I was on this project.

00:17:02.694 --> 00:17:04.089
AUDIENCE: Proud to
Play and Proud to Love.

00:17:04.089 --> 00:17:05.109
STEPHANIE FROSCH: Yes.

00:17:05.109 --> 00:17:05.907
Thank you.

00:17:05.907 --> 00:17:07.240
Proud to Play and Proud to Love.

00:17:07.240 --> 00:17:08.260
He came up with all of that.

00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:10.298
And he's just one of the
most humble individuals

00:17:10.298 --> 00:17:11.339
I've ever met in my life.

00:17:11.339 --> 00:17:14.530
And he is just so active
online and in person.

00:17:14.530 --> 00:17:17.119
So he's another huge,
huge inspiration to me.

00:17:19.377 --> 00:17:21.210
MARS HALLMAN: My biggest
inspirations so far

00:17:21.210 --> 00:17:23.130
have been the entire
staff of the Queer

00:17:23.130 --> 00:17:26.280
Youth Leading the South Camp,
which I went to last summer.

00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:32.020
And it was a five-day long camp,
and Foster Noon and Mustafa

00:17:32.020 --> 00:17:34.200
Sullivan really
helped guide me, like,

00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:36.420
spiritually and personally.

00:17:36.420 --> 00:17:38.560
And I've learned
a lot from them.

00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:41.210
They're both activists
and advocates.

00:17:41.210 --> 00:17:45.250
Mustafa does work in
New York and California

00:17:45.250 --> 00:17:48.500
and travels back and
forth with youth.

00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:52.840
And I realized from him
that I want to do that.

00:17:52.840 --> 00:17:56.086
His life is the life I
want to contribute to.

00:17:56.086 --> 00:17:57.810
FEMALE SPEAKER: That's awesome.

00:17:57.810 --> 00:18:01.105
What is some of the best
advice someone has given you?

00:18:01.105 --> 00:18:02.230
It could be about anything.

00:18:02.230 --> 00:18:03.604
It doesn't have
to be about this.

00:18:03.604 --> 00:18:04.860
Just in general.

00:18:04.860 --> 00:18:06.360
STEPHANIE FROSCH:
I have a professor

00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:09.459
that I'm very close with at
my university named Sybil St.

00:18:09.459 --> 00:18:11.250
Claire, and with her
I did a lot of theater

00:18:11.250 --> 00:18:13.800
for social change,
which became, like,

00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:15.730
my biggest passion in college.

00:18:15.730 --> 00:18:17.640
And something she told
me during my freshman

00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:20.920
year, my first
class, was sometimes

00:18:20.920 --> 00:18:23.770
you have to be comfortable
being uncomfortable,

00:18:23.770 --> 00:18:25.440
because that's
where we most grow.

00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:27.370
So even if we're in
a situation where

00:18:27.370 --> 00:18:30.170
we don't like what's going on,
we don't like being vulnerable,

00:18:30.170 --> 00:18:32.130
we sometimes have to
do it, because society

00:18:32.130 --> 00:18:35.570
has engraved in us that
vulnerability is weakness.

00:18:35.570 --> 00:18:38.000
But really it's allowing
yourself the strength to feel.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:41.080
So if something
isn't going your way,

00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:44.500
whether it's an event or
situation, you can grow in it.

00:18:47.220 --> 00:18:49.170
MARS HALLMAN: Well, my
dad's a music teacher--

00:18:49.170 --> 00:18:50.430
he's my music teacher.

00:18:50.430 --> 00:18:51.070
STEPHANIE FROSCH: Oh, awesome.

00:18:51.070 --> 00:18:52.010
MARS HALLMAN: Yeah.

00:18:52.010 --> 00:18:54.820
And when we're getting
ready for a big audition

00:18:54.820 --> 00:18:56.520
or a competition,
he'll say, just

00:18:56.520 --> 00:18:57.760
practice 15 minutes tonight.

00:18:57.760 --> 00:18:59.670
And I'll say, but I'm supposed
to practice more than that.

00:18:59.670 --> 00:19:01.461
And he'll say, practice
15 minutes tonight.

00:19:01.461 --> 00:19:02.662
Practice 15 minutes.

00:19:02.662 --> 00:19:04.370
And then the next day
I'll say, how long?

00:19:04.370 --> 00:19:07.060
And he'll say, practice
15 minutes tonight.

00:19:07.060 --> 00:19:11.032
And so I'll get ready for honor
band and I'll get stressed

00:19:11.032 --> 00:19:12.740
and I'll say, I haven't
practiced enough.

00:19:12.740 --> 00:19:14.650
And he'll say, have you
practiced 15 minutes every day?

00:19:14.650 --> 00:19:15.400
And I'll say, yes.

00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:17.030
And he says, you've
practiced enough.

00:19:17.030 --> 00:19:18.836
You practiced every day.

00:19:18.836 --> 00:19:20.960
So just kind of taking
everything chunks at a time.

00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:23.730
You feel like you're not ready
for something, you have time.

00:19:23.730 --> 00:19:25.960
Give yourself 15
minutes every day.

00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:27.280
Get yourself ready.

00:19:27.280 --> 00:19:29.446
FEMALE SPEAKER: That's
advice we all could use here.

00:19:31.370 --> 00:19:35.700
What-- time metric doesn't
usually work for you guys,

00:19:35.700 --> 00:19:38.340
you're so young-- but if
you could tell yourself

00:19:38.340 --> 00:19:41.120
five years ago, you tell
yourself five years ago self

00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:42.550
something, what would it be?

00:19:42.550 --> 00:19:45.050
If you could go like "Back to
the Future" style and be like,

00:19:45.050 --> 00:19:46.972
the Cubs are going
to lose this year.

00:19:50.420 --> 00:19:52.480
STEPHANIE FROSCH: Five years.

00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:55.300
I was in high school.

00:19:55.300 --> 00:19:57.970
I mean, besides telling myself,
you know, don't try and rock

00:19:57.970 --> 00:19:59.380
the Shane from
"The L Word" look,

00:19:59.380 --> 00:20:02.910
because you can't, I
guess the biggest advice--

00:20:02.910 --> 00:20:04.170
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:04.170 --> 00:20:06.630
We all know that look.

00:20:06.630 --> 00:20:09.880
I guess the biggest thing is
that even though things seem

00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:12.830
awful and even if
it's raining outside

00:20:12.830 --> 00:20:15.820
and there doesn't seem to
be any light going through,

00:20:15.820 --> 00:20:18.440
it doesn't mean the sun
isn't behind those clouds.

00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:19.540
Things do get better.

00:20:19.540 --> 00:20:20.960
They will get better.

00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:23.580
I mean, if I was telling myself
five years ago that I would

00:20:23.580 --> 00:20:26.090
have an online following
with hundreds of thousands

00:20:26.090 --> 00:20:28.540
of incredible youth wanting
to make a difference,

00:20:28.540 --> 00:20:30.620
I would have never believed it.

00:20:30.620 --> 00:20:32.800
I mean, in high
school I literally

00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:34.920
ate lunch in the bathroom
like in "Mean Girls."

00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:37.830
And it didn't have
that happy ending.

00:20:37.830 --> 00:20:40.410
So I didn't think that it
was going to get better.

00:20:40.410 --> 00:20:43.050
I didn't think one person
would value my opinion,

00:20:43.050 --> 00:20:45.310
let alone an entire community.

00:20:45.310 --> 00:20:48.900
And I feel like it's
just important to take

00:20:48.900 --> 00:20:51.460
every experience as
a growing opportunity

00:20:51.460 --> 00:20:55.760
and realizing that even the
negatives isn't an ending.

00:20:55.760 --> 00:20:56.890
A positive isn't an ending.

00:20:56.890 --> 00:20:58.306
It can even get
better from there.

00:20:58.306 --> 00:21:00.380
And just realizing it
can get so much better

00:21:00.380 --> 00:21:01.990
if you apply your mind to it.

00:21:05.170 --> 00:21:06.039
MARS HALLMAN: Well--

00:21:06.039 --> 00:21:07.080
FEMALE SPEAKER: Practice.

00:21:07.080 --> 00:21:09.980
MARS HALLMAN: I was about 11.

00:21:09.980 --> 00:21:11.711
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:12.210 --> 00:21:15.270
FEMALE SPEAKER: This is why I
didn't want ask the question.

00:21:15.270 --> 00:21:18.014
MARS HALLMAN: I would have told
myself to stop wearing Crocs.

00:21:18.014 --> 00:21:19.180
FEMALE SPEAKER: Good advice.

00:21:19.180 --> 00:21:19.930
Good advice.

00:21:19.930 --> 00:21:20.700
MARS HALLMAN: And
that my parents

00:21:20.700 --> 00:21:22.370
are going to love
me unconditionally

00:21:22.370 --> 00:21:24.320
and I've got nothing
to be afraid of.

00:21:24.320 --> 00:21:24.870
FEMALE SPEAKER: Great advice.

00:21:24.870 --> 00:21:25.770
MARS HALLMAN: Except
for those Crocs.

00:21:25.770 --> 00:21:26.610
FEMALE SPEAKER:
Except for the Crocs.

00:21:26.610 --> 00:21:27.830
STEPHANIE FROSCH: The
international shoe

00:21:27.830 --> 00:21:28.520
of giving up.

00:21:30.809 --> 00:21:32.350
FEMALE SPEAKER: Last
question from me

00:21:32.350 --> 00:21:34.730
is what's one simple thing
that you think people

00:21:34.730 --> 00:21:36.172
can do to help be an Ally?

00:21:36.172 --> 00:21:37.880
STEPHANIE FROSCH: I
feel like the biggest

00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:41.580
thing to be an Ally is not to
be afraid to ask questions,

00:21:41.580 --> 00:21:46.980
because I feel like the easiest
way to grow against something

00:21:46.980 --> 00:21:48.220
is because we don't know.

00:21:48.220 --> 00:21:52.040
It's a lot easier to say, I hate
this versus I don't know this.

00:21:52.040 --> 00:21:53.970
Let me take the opportunity
to understand it.

00:21:53.970 --> 00:21:57.500
So I feel like asking questions
and being honest about it

00:21:57.500 --> 00:21:59.170
and coming at it
through a place of love

00:21:59.170 --> 00:22:01.680
and wanting to learn
versus ignorance

00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:03.130
is one of the main things.

00:22:03.130 --> 00:22:06.010
Definitely passing the
mic to communities.

00:22:06.010 --> 00:22:10.554
I mean, when that terrible event
with Leelah Alcorn happened,

00:22:10.554 --> 00:22:11.970
I wanted to make
a video about it.

00:22:11.970 --> 00:22:15.470
But I was like, I definitely
am too privileged to discuss

00:22:15.470 --> 00:22:16.720
the transgender community.

00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:18.770
So let me pass this
mic, and in my video,

00:22:18.770 --> 00:22:22.210
I'm not even in the video
because it's not my story.

00:22:22.210 --> 00:22:23.680
It belongs to this community.

00:22:23.680 --> 00:22:25.700
So I feel like knowing
when to pass the mic

00:22:25.700 --> 00:22:27.780
and knowing when
to ask questions

00:22:27.780 --> 00:22:32.040
is the biggest thing you
can do to be an Ally.

00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:34.150
MARS HALLMAN: Always affirm.

00:22:34.150 --> 00:22:37.660
Don't question
someone's feelings

00:22:37.660 --> 00:22:41.290
about being trans, being queer.

00:22:41.290 --> 00:22:43.800
Know your intersections.

00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:46.270
When someone comes
to you and tells you,

00:22:46.270 --> 00:22:48.730
you're coming to me from
a place of privilege

00:22:48.730 --> 00:22:51.180
and you're not understanding,
don't say, I do understand.

00:22:51.180 --> 00:22:51.750
I do.

00:22:51.750 --> 00:22:52.500
Because you don't.

00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:53.020
STEPHANIE FROSCH: No, you don't.

00:22:53.020 --> 00:22:54.019
MARS HALLMAN: You don't.

00:22:54.019 --> 00:22:54.850
And that's OK.

00:22:54.850 --> 00:22:57.220
You can only gain
that understanding

00:22:57.220 --> 00:22:59.180
by listening when
someone tells you,

00:22:59.180 --> 00:23:01.780
you're coming to
me with privilege.

00:23:01.780 --> 00:23:02.430
Say, yes.

00:23:02.430 --> 00:23:03.880
Yes, I am.

00:23:03.880 --> 00:23:05.930
FEMALE SPEAKER: Do we
have audience questions?

00:23:05.930 --> 00:23:09.040
AUDIENCE: Thank you for coming
out and chatting with us

00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:12.370
and to all the online audience,
chatting with them as well.

00:23:12.370 --> 00:23:14.760
You have a ton of
people supporting you

00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:18.240
who are older adults--
you are adults as well,

00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:22.000
but, you know, people your
parents' age, our age.

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:24.790
And at times it may feel
that we're disconnected

00:23:24.790 --> 00:23:26.110
from you and your experience.

00:23:26.110 --> 00:23:27.360
You know, we're not
in school day-to-day.

00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:28.760
You know, we're in
the workplace, which

00:23:28.760 --> 00:23:29.480
is a little bit different.

00:23:29.480 --> 00:23:31.180
And there are, you know,
different rules and structures

00:23:31.180 --> 00:23:32.290
around each place.

00:23:32.290 --> 00:23:35.560
But I would ask
for me personally

00:23:35.560 --> 00:23:37.910
and for all of the adults
out there who do support you,

00:23:37.910 --> 00:23:40.360
what can we do to help you more?

00:23:40.360 --> 00:23:42.560
What can we do to sort
of bridge that connection

00:23:42.560 --> 00:23:45.040
between your world and
our world where we may

00:23:45.040 --> 00:23:46.592
be able to do more to help you?

00:23:46.592 --> 00:23:47.800
And what does that look like?

00:23:47.800 --> 00:23:48.747
And what could we do?

00:23:48.747 --> 00:23:50.330
MARS HALLMAN: It
looks like listening.

00:23:50.330 --> 00:23:52.590
It looks like open ears.

00:23:52.590 --> 00:23:56.150
When a young person comes to
you with their experience,

00:23:56.150 --> 00:23:59.605
you can't come back at
them with, your young.

00:23:59.605 --> 00:24:00.319
It'll get better.

00:24:00.319 --> 00:24:00.860
You're young.

00:24:00.860 --> 00:24:01.880
Just wait a few years.

00:24:01.880 --> 00:24:04.110
Because for some of us,
we can't wait any more.

00:24:04.110 --> 00:24:05.318
We can't wait any more years.

00:24:08.130 --> 00:24:12.610
STEPHANIE FROSCH: It's called
Twitter, and what-- no,

00:24:12.610 --> 00:24:13.390
besides that.

00:24:13.390 --> 00:24:16.860
I mean, my dad knows nothing
about the internet at all,

00:24:16.860 --> 00:24:19.450
but the biggest thing is
that I notice especially

00:24:19.450 --> 00:24:22.880
with my professors and
parents and parents of friends

00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:27.070
is even if we're not going
to you but even saying,

00:24:27.070 --> 00:24:29.890
I'm here if and when you want to
talk, that's the biggest thing.

00:24:29.890 --> 00:24:31.970
The reason why I was so
comfortable coming out

00:24:31.970 --> 00:24:33.940
to my mom is because even
when I was not ready,

00:24:33.940 --> 00:24:36.850
was not going to talk,
she always let me know,

00:24:36.850 --> 00:24:37.910
I'm here to listen.

00:24:37.910 --> 00:24:40.840
So definitely keeping open
ears like Mars suggested.

00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:45.060
And then, especially I know
at least from, like, my dad,

00:24:45.060 --> 00:24:47.330
he always says, you
don't have it that bad.

00:24:47.330 --> 00:24:52.260
When I was your age-- so I
feel like just not belittling

00:24:52.260 --> 00:24:54.180
one's experience,
because weight is--

00:24:54.180 --> 00:24:56.300
you know, what is
10 pounds to me

00:24:56.300 --> 00:24:58.949
is going to be nothing to,
like, a heavyweight champion.

00:24:58.949 --> 00:25:00.990
So everyone has a different
definition of weight.

00:25:00.990 --> 00:25:02.660
And just being there.

00:25:02.660 --> 00:25:05.450
Just being open, honest,
having those ears.

00:25:05.450 --> 00:25:06.570
Yeah.

00:25:06.570 --> 00:25:07.420
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:25:07.420 --> 00:25:07.880
MARS HALLMAN: Thank you.

00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:09.340
STEPHANIE FROSCH: Thank you.

00:25:09.340 --> 00:25:11.673
AUDIENCE: You guys, first
off, thank you for being here.

00:25:11.673 --> 00:25:14.089
And I'm totally blown
away by you two.

00:25:14.089 --> 00:25:16.630
I've been sitting here, like,
on the edge of tears just blown

00:25:16.630 --> 00:25:23.720
away by youth and your strength
in both how you show that.

00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:25.460
Steph, your videos
are great, but I'm

00:25:25.460 --> 00:25:29.270
going to address this to Mars
because there would be no way

00:25:29.270 --> 00:25:31.960
that I could have summoned
up the courage to do anything

00:25:31.960 --> 00:25:33.670
like what you've
done in high school.

00:25:33.670 --> 00:25:36.050
And so I guess what
I'd like to know,

00:25:36.050 --> 00:25:38.580
in creating that in
an environment that's

00:25:38.580 --> 00:25:41.330
not some liberal West
Coast enclave-- I mean,

00:25:41.330 --> 00:25:43.430
you are out there
doing it-- maybe give

00:25:43.430 --> 00:25:47.330
one thing that surprised you
when you actually went through

00:25:47.330 --> 00:25:50.570
with it in a positive way and
maybe any negative backlash

00:25:50.570 --> 00:25:51.770
that you've had to overcome.

00:25:51.770 --> 00:25:54.121
I guess I'm just really
interested that you've

00:25:54.121 --> 00:25:54.620
done this.

00:25:54.620 --> 00:25:58.740
I'm just sitting here-- you
are like this wise person

00:25:58.740 --> 00:26:01.230
and really impressive.

00:26:01.230 --> 00:26:02.530
MARS HALLMAN: Thank you.

00:26:02.530 --> 00:26:03.320
I'm going to start
with the negative one,

00:26:03.320 --> 00:26:05.320
because I don't want to
end with a negative one.

00:26:05.320 --> 00:26:06.160
AUDIENCE: Feel free.

00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:08.350
MARS HALLMAN: A
negative surprise.

00:26:08.350 --> 00:26:11.050
All the faith backlash.

00:26:11.050 --> 00:26:13.930
I think that any faith
should be a home,

00:26:13.930 --> 00:26:18.200
and when you use what should be
a shield as a weapon to hurt,

00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:22.519
that's what surprised me the
most and was really awful.

00:26:22.519 --> 00:26:25.060
I know a lot of my friends came
to me and said, what do I do?

00:26:25.060 --> 00:26:27.030
My parents are huge
supporters of this church

00:26:27.030 --> 00:26:31.140
that's telling me you personally
are dragging us to hell.

00:26:31.140 --> 00:26:32.167
What do I do?

00:26:32.167 --> 00:26:33.500
And not having answers for them.

00:26:33.500 --> 00:26:35.300
That was the worst surprise.

00:26:35.300 --> 00:26:37.870
But good surprises.

00:26:37.870 --> 00:26:40.630
All of the adult support
that I wasn't expecting

00:26:40.630 --> 00:26:43.540
from not just South Georgia,
but all over Georgia, all

00:26:43.540 --> 00:26:46.150
over the South, all over the US.

00:26:46.150 --> 00:26:47.780
Anyone who's read
my story, people

00:26:47.780 --> 00:26:50.460
who would just mention it
and say, hey, I'm from there.

00:26:50.460 --> 00:26:51.730
I survived your school.

00:26:51.730 --> 00:26:57.660
Or, hey, I can't send you money,
I'm going to send you a prayer.

00:26:57.660 --> 00:27:00.846
I'm going to send
you these words.

00:27:00.846 --> 00:27:02.720
And then being able to
pass on those messages

00:27:02.720 --> 00:27:04.511
to the members of the
Gay-Straight Alliance

00:27:04.511 --> 00:27:07.630
and having them see, that
person's, like, 40 years old

00:27:07.630 --> 00:27:10.770
and they were gay in
Berry and they lived?

00:27:10.770 --> 00:27:13.340
So that was the
best surprise was

00:27:13.340 --> 00:27:16.270
when older people would
come back and reach out back

00:27:16.270 --> 00:27:18.710
to me, back to my peers.

00:27:18.710 --> 00:27:22.812
I really wasn't expecting that,
and it was really inspiring.

00:27:22.812 --> 00:27:23.740
AUDIENCE: Excellent.

00:27:23.740 --> 00:27:26.400
Thank you guys for being
here, and have fun tonight.

00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:27.400
MARS HALLMAN: Thank you.

00:27:27.400 --> 00:27:29.290
STEPHANIE FROSCH: Thank you.

00:27:29.290 --> 00:27:32.260
AUDIENCE: So I think,
you know, growing up,

00:27:32.260 --> 00:27:34.330
especially at this
time, there's a lot

00:27:34.330 --> 00:27:37.130
of, like, online resources.

00:27:37.130 --> 00:27:40.060
You know, Steph, you have
your YouTube channel.

00:27:40.060 --> 00:27:43.550
But on the opposite
end, there's also

00:27:43.550 --> 00:27:46.710
kind of the increase
in cyberbullying.

00:27:46.710 --> 00:27:50.130
And I was wondering if
you had any experiences

00:27:50.130 --> 00:27:52.370
with that or friends
growing up with that

00:27:52.370 --> 00:27:55.210
and how people now can kind
of address that and work

00:27:55.210 --> 00:27:56.485
through it?

00:27:56.485 --> 00:27:58.110
STEPHANIE FROSCH: I
mean, cyberbullying

00:27:58.110 --> 00:28:00.870
is definitely-- it's a
huge issue that's going on.

00:28:00.870 --> 00:28:03.824
And I feel like as
technology is increasing

00:28:03.824 --> 00:28:05.990
and we're being connected
in so many different ways,

00:28:05.990 --> 00:28:07.448
there's also many
different ways we

00:28:07.448 --> 00:28:08.710
can come up with precautions.

00:28:08.710 --> 00:28:10.524
I mean, before
you get on a bike,

00:28:10.524 --> 00:28:12.190
you know, there's the
chance of falling.

00:28:12.190 --> 00:28:14.360
And that could happen
with going online as well.

00:28:14.360 --> 00:28:16.700
So even what I've
noticed is there's ways

00:28:16.700 --> 00:28:20.870
that you can even block phrases
from showing up on comments.

00:28:20.870 --> 00:28:26.400
So I could flag any LGBTQ+ slur
or word that I just don't want

00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:29.630
to see on there, and they
will be completely gone.

00:28:29.630 --> 00:28:31.820
And then you're not
giving those people

00:28:31.820 --> 00:28:34.420
their voices, because I
feel like the reason why

00:28:34.420 --> 00:28:37.420
cyberbullying continues is
because you allow them to have

00:28:37.420 --> 00:28:40.600
the power by even-- even when
I get people commenting back

00:28:40.600 --> 00:28:41.810
saying, you can't say this.

00:28:41.810 --> 00:28:43.634
This is awful.

00:28:43.634 --> 00:28:45.050
That's what they
want, a reaction.

00:28:45.050 --> 00:28:48.210
So by simply taking
their voice away,

00:28:48.210 --> 00:28:50.060
that's the easiest way to win.

00:28:50.060 --> 00:28:53.980
And it doesn't
need to affect you.

00:28:53.980 --> 00:28:57.490
MARS HALLMAN: I don't have
a huge online presence.

00:28:57.490 --> 00:28:58.510
I just don't.

00:28:58.510 --> 00:29:00.620
AUDIENCE: I mean, I
think it also applies to,

00:29:00.620 --> 00:29:04.062
like, people without online
presences because, you know,

00:29:04.062 --> 00:29:07.200
even within they're kind of like
sphere of people they interact

00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:09.080
with, you have
Facebook accounts,

00:29:09.080 --> 00:29:12.820
and there's a lot of people that
you're kind of, like, friends

00:29:12.820 --> 00:29:15.080
with and then they're kind
of more acquaintances.

00:29:15.080 --> 00:29:21.760
And, like, growing up you're
on these accounts a lot.

00:29:21.760 --> 00:29:25.780
And kind of the responses
on those personal accounts

00:29:25.780 --> 00:29:28.720
are almost more personal
attacks and can be, like, harder

00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:29.730
to work through.

00:29:29.730 --> 00:29:31.850
And so do you have any
comments regarding that?

00:29:31.850 --> 00:29:34.660
MARS HALLMAN: Back in middle
school, I was Facebook savvy.

00:29:34.660 --> 00:29:36.710
Tail end of My Space
and then Facebook.

00:29:36.710 --> 00:29:36.990
STEPHANIE FROSCH: Wow.

00:29:36.990 --> 00:29:37.864
I wasn't allowed one.

00:29:37.864 --> 00:29:39.315
You are so much
cooler than I was.

00:29:41.567 --> 00:29:42.358
MARS HALLMAN: What?

00:29:42.358 --> 00:29:43.762
MRS. HALLMAN: I
had the password.

00:29:43.762 --> 00:29:44.470
MARS HALLMAN: Oh.

00:29:44.470 --> 00:29:46.320
That's my mom who
had my password.

00:29:49.210 --> 00:29:52.537
And until I went through
and was like, why

00:29:52.537 --> 00:29:54.620
am I friends with these
people, occasionally there

00:29:54.620 --> 00:29:57.860
was the f-slur, the q-slur,
the d-slur, the t-slur,

00:29:57.860 --> 00:29:59.680
all those fun ones.

00:29:59.680 --> 00:30:03.320
And I would, in shame,
delete the messages.

00:30:03.320 --> 00:30:05.900
But it would still,
like, be there.

00:30:05.900 --> 00:30:08.200
Like, someone said that to me.

00:30:08.200 --> 00:30:10.350
Someone who sees me daily.

00:30:10.350 --> 00:30:19.360
So what I would suggest
doing, block the person online

00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:20.615
and block them IRL.

00:30:23.260 --> 00:30:24.340
Control your circles.

00:30:24.340 --> 00:30:26.310
Control your safe spaces.

00:30:26.310 --> 00:30:30.930
Try not to let those toxic
people into where they can even

00:30:30.930 --> 00:30:32.584
touch you.

00:30:32.584 --> 00:30:33.500
AUDIENCE: Good advice.

00:30:33.500 --> 00:30:34.300
Thank you.

00:30:34.300 --> 00:30:34.935
MARS HALLMAN: Thank you.

00:30:34.935 --> 00:30:35.320
STEPHANIE FROSCH: Thank you.

00:30:35.320 --> 00:30:35.930
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:30:35.930 --> 00:30:37.175
Thank you for being here.

00:30:37.175 --> 00:30:38.050
So I have a question.

00:30:38.050 --> 00:30:39.633
So it seems to me
that you're actually

00:30:39.633 --> 00:30:42.700
kind of advocating on two
fronts, unfortunately.

00:30:42.700 --> 00:30:46.630
The front of being LGBTQ+,
and any other letters,

00:30:46.630 --> 00:30:49.310
and the front of people
that people tend to be mean

00:30:49.310 --> 00:30:51.400
to and what that's like.

00:30:51.400 --> 00:30:54.916
And that's very sad, but it
feels like it's very true.

00:30:54.916 --> 00:30:57.040
So how do you kind of find
the balance between that

00:30:57.040 --> 00:31:00.384
and, like, keep both
of these messages

00:31:00.384 --> 00:31:01.675
kind of separate and important?

00:31:05.434 --> 00:31:08.100
MARS HALLMAN: I try to make sure
any safe space that I'm part of

00:31:08.100 --> 00:31:10.710
or create is a safe
space for all people.

00:31:10.710 --> 00:31:12.880
But it's important
when you're organizing

00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:15.300
those kind of spaces,
you have your message

00:31:15.300 --> 00:31:16.719
clear from the beginning.

00:31:16.719 --> 00:31:18.260
And make sure everyone
involved knows

00:31:18.260 --> 00:31:21.790
this is a space
for trans rights.

00:31:21.790 --> 00:31:24.870
This is a space for
intersectional feminism.

00:31:24.870 --> 00:31:30.280
This is a place for this group.

00:31:30.280 --> 00:31:31.920
But also make sure
any safe place

00:31:31.920 --> 00:31:34.910
is a safe space universally.

00:31:34.910 --> 00:31:39.040
So as the organizer,
as you, know,

00:31:39.040 --> 00:31:41.159
the moderator, the
organizer, the facilitator,

00:31:41.159 --> 00:31:42.950
it's kind of up to that
person to make sure

00:31:42.950 --> 00:31:47.625
that everything stays
separate and important.

00:31:47.625 --> 00:31:49.750
STEPHANIE FROSCH: What I've
experienced, especially

00:31:49.750 --> 00:31:52.790
at my school, was
when I was bullied

00:31:52.790 --> 00:31:55.796
for being gay, I feel like it
wasn't that I was being bullied

00:31:55.796 --> 00:31:58.170
for being gay, it was just I
was being bullied because it

00:31:58.170 --> 00:31:59.660
was something different.

00:31:59.660 --> 00:32:01.580
So before I was
out, I was made fun

00:32:01.580 --> 00:32:03.740
of because I had a
wheelie backpack.

00:32:03.740 --> 00:32:07.580
And I had a friend who was made
fun of because she hasn't cut

00:32:07.580 --> 00:32:09.000
her hair since she was four.

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:12.930
And I'm like, whether
I came out as gay

00:32:12.930 --> 00:32:16.000
or I came out as,
you know, a bear,

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:18.930
I would be made fun of
because it was different.

00:32:18.930 --> 00:32:22.677
And especially having a
safe space to go to, which

00:32:22.677 --> 00:32:23.760
I didn't have at the time.

00:32:23.760 --> 00:32:27.700
I know if I did have a GSA, my
entire adolescent experience

00:32:27.700 --> 00:32:30.210
would be completely
different, but online I

00:32:30.210 --> 00:32:32.940
did have those safe spaces and
I did have those resources.

00:32:32.940 --> 00:32:34.900
And I feel like
it is so important

00:32:34.900 --> 00:32:36.840
to continue to grow
these safe spaces

00:32:36.840 --> 00:32:40.367
and to show the entire world no
matter-- because you can come

00:32:40.367 --> 00:32:41.950
out when you're five,
you can come out

00:32:41.950 --> 00:32:43.980
when you're 50,
that no matter what,

00:32:43.980 --> 00:32:45.560
there is a community for you.

00:32:45.560 --> 00:32:47.775
Even if you feel like
you won't fit in even,

00:32:47.775 --> 00:32:49.900
even if you feel like no
one's going to understand,

00:32:49.900 --> 00:32:52.300
there's going to be people who,
even if they don't understand,

00:32:52.300 --> 00:32:53.966
they will listen and
they will be there.

00:32:53.966 --> 00:32:56.770
And that is the most
important thing,

00:32:56.770 --> 00:32:58.350
because you want to
surround yourself

00:32:58.350 --> 00:32:59.800
with people who
listen, not people

00:32:59.800 --> 00:33:02.488
who throw you down and
don't let you be heard.

00:33:04.739 --> 00:33:06.780
FEMALE SPEAKER: Thank you
so much for being here.

00:33:06.780 --> 00:33:10.270
Thank you for being excellent
advocates and activists

00:33:10.270 --> 00:33:11.990
and just beacons of positivity.

00:33:11.990 --> 00:33:13.615
So let's give them
a round of applause.

00:33:13.615 --> 00:33:15.450
STEPHANIE FROSCH: Thank
you for having us.
