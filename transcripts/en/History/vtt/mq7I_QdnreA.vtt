00:00:02.335 --> 00:00:03.962
NARRATOR: Harriet Tubman,
former slave and leader

00:00:03.962 --> 00:00:08.550
in the Underground Railroad,
was also a Union spy,

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.593
and the first
woman in US history

00:00:10.593 --> 00:00:12.929
to lead a military expedition.

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:14.514
Here's how.

00:00:14.514 --> 00:00:16.808
After escaping slavery
herself, Harriet Tubman rescued

00:00:16.808 --> 00:00:19.394
slaves throughout the 1850s.

00:00:19.394 --> 00:00:21.980
And when the Civil War started,
she offered her services

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:23.106
to the Union War Effort.

00:00:23.106 --> 00:00:24.733
[music playing]

00:00:24.733 --> 00:00:27.944
In 1863, she was assigned
to Colonel James Montgomery

00:00:27.944 --> 00:00:31.156
to work for the Union Army
as a nurse, cook, and spy.

00:00:31.156 --> 00:00:33.783
[music playing]

00:00:33.783 --> 00:00:36.411
Tubman disguised herself
as an aging woman

00:00:36.411 --> 00:00:39.247
and moved behind
Confederate lines unnoticed,

00:00:39.247 --> 00:00:42.250
gathering information from
a network of informants.

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:44.669
Slaves traded information
in exchange for a chance

00:00:44.669 --> 00:00:46.921
of freedom, and sometimes cash.

00:00:46.921 --> 00:00:48.757
The covert operation
was approved

00:00:48.757 --> 00:00:51.634
by President Abraham
Lincoln and run by Secretary

00:00:51.634 --> 00:00:53.887
of State, William Seward.

00:00:53.887 --> 00:00:55.555
In South Carolina,
Tubman worked in

00:00:55.555 --> 00:00:58.016
Union-controlled
"contraband camps," where

00:00:58.016 --> 00:01:00.518
escaped slaves sought safety.

00:01:00.518 --> 00:01:02.353
There, she recruited
local informants

00:01:02.353 --> 00:01:04.647
and found out where other
slaves were being held.

00:01:04.647 --> 00:01:06.566
Tubman and other
spies would gather

00:01:06.566 --> 00:01:08.568
Intel about Confederate plans--

00:01:08.568 --> 00:01:11.154
--such as where they had dropped
barrels filled with gunpowder

00:01:11.154 --> 00:01:12.989
to attack Union boats.

00:01:12.989 --> 00:01:16.868
On June 1, 1863, alongside
Colonel Montgomery,

00:01:16.868 --> 00:01:20.622
she led 300 black soldiers
to raid rice plantations

00:01:20.622 --> 00:01:22.957
along the Combahee
River in South Carolina,

00:01:22.957 --> 00:01:26.336
making her the first woman
in American history to plan

00:01:26.336 --> 00:01:28.797
and lead a military operation.

00:01:28.797 --> 00:01:30.882
The soldiers ransacked
the plantation,

00:01:30.882 --> 00:01:35.845
setting fire to buildings and
freeing more than 700 slaves.

00:01:35.845 --> 00:01:37.639
Tubman continued
to work as a nurse,

00:01:37.639 --> 00:01:39.724
cook, and spy for another year.

00:01:39.724 --> 00:01:44.145
But she was only paid $200
for her entire war service,

00:01:44.145 --> 00:01:46.105
and was never paid
all of the benefits

00:01:46.105 --> 00:01:48.358
owed to her, despite
multiple appeals

00:01:48.358 --> 00:01:50.026
to the federal government.

00:01:50.026 --> 00:01:53.947
It wasn't until 1890, two years
after her husband's death,

00:01:53.947 --> 00:01:55.824
that she received a
small pension for being

00:01:55.824 --> 00:01:57.617
the widow of a war veteran.

00:01:57.617 --> 00:02:01.830
And it wasn't until 1899 that
her pension was increased.

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:05.124
But that didn't make up for
the benefits she deserved.

00:02:05.124 --> 00:02:07.585
It would take another
100 years for Tubman

00:02:07.585 --> 00:02:10.505
to get the money she was
owed, when in 2002, Congress

00:02:10.505 --> 00:02:12.549
was again alerted
about the pension,

00:02:12.549 --> 00:02:17.762
and soon after provided $11,750
to the Harriet Tubman Home

00:02:17.762 --> 00:02:18.721
in Auburn, New York.
