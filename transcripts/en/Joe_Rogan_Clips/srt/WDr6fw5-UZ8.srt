1
00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:03,480
The Joe Rogan experience. That's
what, that's what I'm saying,

2
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:07,740
I have shit going on. I can't worry
overtly all day long about like,

3
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:10,650
is this meal going to, it's like, how
am I going to get fucked that shit?

4
00:00:10,651 --> 00:00:12,780
But that's one of the things that
people like about it. Like, okay,

5
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:16,970
I'm on this diet now I've
got to concentrate. Is it
like meal prep? Really? Um,

6
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:19,630
yeah. Or meal prepping and
Sunday prepping all up.

7
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:22,740
Where I look at my shows
at [inaudible] prep,

8
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:26,350
I am in control of my world
asteroid hurdling towards us.

9
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:32,550
Complete control of controlling rocket
space. I have a finite lifespan.

10
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:36,360
I have to constantly feet
and shit. Everything's fine.
Everything else is okay.

11
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:41,430
Yeah, everything's fine. My buddy texted
me today by the way, I want, he goes, uh,

12
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:45,780
he had a concern I talked about on
another podcast about how he couldn't,

13
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:47,490
he didn't shit for like five days.
Oh.

14
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:50,100
I have a buddy who went through that and
he went to the doctor and he has this

15
00:00:50,101 --> 00:00:51,900
thing and he had to get help
for it. He texted me, he goes,

16
00:00:51,901 --> 00:00:55,260
I just want to let you know I'm back
from vacation. I feel really good. Also,

17
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:58,170
I'm shitting like normal again.
And I was like, I feel like a,

18
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,900
like a really proud friend. Like
he, he was really struggling.

19
00:01:00,901 --> 00:01:03,180
He was nervous about it. He was like,
dude, I haven't shit in like four days.

20
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:07,260
I was like four fucking days. Who was a
guy that I worked with on fear factor.

21
00:01:07,261 --> 00:01:09,930
I don't want to shame him, so I won't
say his name. He wants it out there.

22
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:15,150
Great Guy. Um, he had a real
problem, a real problem.

23
00:01:15,151 --> 00:01:17,190
It was packed in there for days and days.

24
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:18,570
It wasn't coming out and he could feel it.

25
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:21,600
Like you could touch his butt hole
and feel it inside. It was hard.

26
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:23,590
Fuck as hard girls.
Yeah.

27
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:28,170
So fiber dog had to go to a doctor and
they literally had to chip it out of his

28
00:01:28,171 --> 00:01:32,130
asshole. Shut the fuck up.
Allocated impacted on his butt hole.

29
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:36,180
They had to get in there and break it up
and then they had to make him take this

30
00:01:36,181 --> 00:01:39,180
like really intense laxative.

31
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:41,610
So he takes this really intense laxative,
like,

32
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:44,430
like weapons grade lacks and they're in,

33
00:01:44,431 --> 00:01:46,920
they're chipping away at the stone wall,

34
00:01:46,921 --> 00:01:51,921
which is essentially just like a dam to
keep all this shit juice is piling up.

35
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:52,913
Damn it.

36
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:56,190
Because he's got the impacted dried out
shit that should have been out of his

37
00:01:56,191 --> 00:01:57,720
body days ago.

38
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:01,200
And then he's got the
fresh shit on top of that.

39
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:06,320
And on top of that he's got this
chemical laxative that just selling off

40
00:02:06,661 --> 00:02:08,390
explosions inside of them.

41
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:14,670
And the doctor says it was a fucking
hammer hammer and a screwdriver just

42
00:02:14,671 --> 00:02:18,510
whacking at the ship rock that's at
the bottom of his ass hole and then it

43
00:02:18,511 --> 00:02:21,510
breaks loose and just explodes everywhere.
Fuck.

44
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:23,610
Like he gave birth to a dead seal,

45
00:02:23,611 --> 00:02:28,320
just blah flying out of the bag.
All right, we got it. We got it.

46
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:31,890
How much did you, how much
weight you lose? I don't know.
But he said it was awful.

47
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:36,360
It was awful. Like they had a
PR pry the shit out of his ass.

48
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,320
I'm going to break it up.

49
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:42,240
Those are the kinds of pains those
downstairs today from you're not shitting.

50
00:02:42,241 --> 00:02:46,590
Yes, it's a, what's it called? A, um,
you give yourself, um, imagine that.

51
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:49,730
What's it called? Come on, look it up.
You know what I'm talking about? It's no,

52
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:52,920
but there's a, there's a word it's
called [inaudible]. It's like a toxic,

53
00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:56,420
like toxic shock syndrome that women get
if they leave like a tampon into long.

54
00:02:56,430 --> 00:03:00,550
Yeah. If you're, if you don't shit
for a certain amount of time, you,

55
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:02,320
you poison yourself. Hmm. Yeah.

56
00:03:02,321 --> 00:03:04,060
It starts to leak into your
organs and should something,

57
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:07,930
it's something absurdly just, there
was a show a one of those like, um, oh,

58
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:12,960
a 600 pound life or whatever those shows
are, this woman wouldn't shit. And she,

59
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:16,030
she, which she can polling in holding
out and they're like, purpose. Yes. Why?

60
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:18,940
Because she didn't want, she couldn't
move to shit. She was so fucking big,

61
00:03:18,941 --> 00:03:19,870
she couldn't move to shit.

62
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:22,150
So the ship packed up and sat
around and they were like,

63
00:03:22,151 --> 00:03:24,550
you're gonna fucking die. It's gonna get
in your bloods. It's going to get your,

64
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:28,190
your other organs in your bloodstream
and kill you. Isn't it? Like,

65
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:31,600
doesn't that freak you out when you watch
a show like that where someone's like,

66
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:35,080
like uh, uh, what are those called?

67
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:40,060
Hoarders like order or someone who's
gaining a ton away or things get there,

68
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:43,960
but you know that you could get there.
Yep. You know, you couldn't get there,

69
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:46,990
but you know that a person could
get there. Yeah, right. Right.

70
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:51,820
You now Andrew Santino May, 2019
you're not going to get there. No,

71
00:03:51,821 --> 00:03:53,020
probably not.
You're fine.

72
00:03:53,490 --> 00:03:58,000
But some people will get that bad road
and they can't turn around. They're stuck.

73
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,280
Yeah. And Age. But they compile it. Right?

74
00:04:00,281 --> 00:04:04,570
Cause that cause the depression feeds the
hunger feeds the depression. Yeah. Yeah.

75
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:06,310
What does that,
that's shit.

76
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,780
[inaudible] he died after
feces filled bowel burst.

77
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:15,900
Oh look how much shippers there is rectum
a dilated up to 18 centimeters inside

78
00:04:17,831 --> 00:04:21,670
his body and was filled with feces
according to the BMJ case report.

79
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:25,990
24 24 he's a child.
24.

80
00:04:25,991 --> 00:04:30,040
This isn't some 80 year old man who just
is like, wow, he's autistic. Right? Okay.

81
00:04:30,041 --> 00:04:34,870
It's probably constipation. Oh, okay.
Wow. Great. Now we feel bad. Jamie.

82
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:38,590
Thanks Jamie.
Fox baiting us with some shit.

83
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:43,270
[inaudible] still look at that
guy almost died from constipation.

84
00:04:43,271 --> 00:04:44,200
So it's a few people.

85
00:04:44,201 --> 00:04:49,201
Every year they had to surgically remove
two leaders of poop up coca cola bottle

86
00:04:49,211 --> 00:04:53,060
filled with poop to leaders to lead it.

87
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:54,730
Think of a liter bottle of coke.

88
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:59,080
You take two of those fill with sand
and stuffed up your ass shit and you're

89
00:04:59,081 --> 00:05:04,070
filled with sand leading to a
lack of blood flow to the leg.

90
00:05:04,071 --> 00:05:06,790
He was pressing on his
artery, bro. Oh my God.

91
00:05:06,791 --> 00:05:09,460
It was his shit was choking his leg out.

92
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:14,050
That's what was happening.

93
00:05:14,051 --> 00:05:18,430
Shit was just Chinwag arm Shin Hospital
for 23 days and it took 13 days for you

94
00:05:18,431 --> 00:05:21,020
could walk again.
Oh boy.

95
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:26,610
No explanation has been found yet as to
explain his significant faecal loading,

96
00:05:27,671 --> 00:05:31,690
unloading constipation, looking
at these spell fecal, f, a, e,

97
00:05:31,691 --> 00:05:36,280
c a.L is that because they're in
Australia? Probably fucking those idiots.

98
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:40,510
They guy was probably bang and Kangaroos
or something. They caught some disease.

99
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:43,460
No Chinese. Those people got no
time to pope. I'm faecal loading,

100
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:47,890
cycle us with the name.
Have you heard of that? Um,

101
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:53,100
coupled that they ate a raw rat heart
from Mongolia and they got the black

102
00:05:55,511 --> 00:06:00,420
plague. What? Yeah, they died
exhibit the black plague from plugin.

103
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,890
Fucking crazy people around liver.
That's what it was. A liver.

104
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:09,070
They ate a raw rat liver and
they died of the bubonic plague.

105
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:12,500
Why did they eat it? Tigger bubonic
plague. I think it'd be bionic players.

106
00:06:12,501 --> 00:06:14,820
Black sounds like, yeah, it's gotta
be Blue Bond. They have a bionic play.

107
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:18,620
What's the difference? Cause the
bubonic plague was a bacteria, right?

108
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,640
Well what's the black plague? That was
a virus, right? It wasn't that a virus.

109
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,990
What do you at Doctor? Not,
not anymore. I got this bar.

110
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,770
Apparently you're not gonna like keep the,

111
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:31,280
you can't keep the faecal loading samples.
College.

112
00:06:31,281 --> 00:06:34,430
What did you think you were going
to be a comedian? Really? Man,

113
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:37,200
you're like this is a waste of time.
No, it's just funny because I'll show,

114
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:42,230
I had my, my mom throwing show, Andrew
Santina no case on his phone. Yeah.

115
00:06:42,231 --> 00:06:44,720
Fuck that shit is one of those gangs.
The black plague was a aid,

116
00:06:44,721 --> 00:06:46,810
an event during a time period,

117
00:06:46,811 --> 00:06:50,780
and the 13 hundreds and the bubonic
plague is a thing you can get. Right.

118
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:55,130
But the black peg leg was
what? A viral diseases. It's
killing people, right? Yeah.

119
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:59,330
So it's the bubonic plague that these
folks got and they got it from eating a

120
00:06:59,331 --> 00:07:03,530
raw rats, heart or liver. Think
it's liver. Can you get us,

121
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:07,910
what does this kidney, Kidney, oh, that's
in high school. Why would they kidneys.
