00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:12.000
Abstract expressionism
is often divided

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.129
into two classifications,
one of which

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:20.930
is action painting, which is
the work typified by Bill de

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:23.960
Kooning or Jackson
Pollock, where you feel

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:28.110
the action of the
artist on the canvas.

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:30.310
The other side doesn't
really have a name,

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:32.640
but you might call
it still painting,

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.680
because in fact, there's
an absence of gesture,

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:40.680
or activity, or
angst on the canvas.

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:46.280
Instead, what you have
is quiet contemplation,

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.880
a mood of deep
immersion in color.

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:54.310
In a Rothko painting, you
have three or four zones

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:58.190
of different thinly-washed
layers of color

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:01.620
all interacting with each
other in a subtle way.

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.150
Not like bold
contrasts, but instead

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:12.180
almost swimming into each other
to get your eye and your brain

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:17.890
working optically to almost
immerse your consciousness

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:21.480
in these fields that
Rothko has created.

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:23.030
They may look simple.

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:25.040
On the other hand,
to really figure out

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.800
how he created those effects
is far more complicated.

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:35.710
And it's not easy to understand
what colors are actually

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:38.250
in which layers on the canvas.

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.660
The mystery of the
whole thing is actually

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:43.850
appropriate to Rothko's goals.

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:46.780
He's wanting to
make a picture which

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:53.110
advertises its own mystery,
its solitary quality,

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:56.280
its introspective quality.

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.320
It's a quality that he felt was
reflecting his own state while

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.710
painting.

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:04.630
And I think it's
a quality that he

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:08.870
wanted to inspire
in the viewers who

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:12.290
were in the space
of his paintings.

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:15.440
In the exhibition, we've
installed an entire room

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:20.320
only of Rothko, not
only for the reason

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:25.590
that we have many beautiful
paintings to present,

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:30.740
but because of this power they
have to create an environment.

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:34.370
You feel the intimacy
of the atmosphere

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:36.060
that he has made for you.

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:43.160
The point of Rothko's art is to
provide a universe for viewers

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.010
that they don't have
in the real world.

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:50.240
There is definitely a spiritual
side to what Rothko was doing.

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:53.570
It's not at all an
ironic art, or a kind

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:57.880
of calculated, clever,
sort of tactical art.

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:00.470
In fact, one of the
quotations of Rothko's that's

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:04.430
repeated often is,
"Silence is so accurate."

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:07.480
What he was really doing
was extolling the power

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.510
of an abstract
language to say so much

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:14.480
more than words could do.

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:17.390
I think when you look
at a painting by Rothko,

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:22.080
you also realize what is meant
by the term "all over," which

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:25.000
is often used in regard
to Abstract Expressionist

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.450
painting.

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:30.800
It's not like there's a
center point and the edges,

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:35.950
or the corners, or the sides
are of lesser importance

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:38.160
than the core.

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:42.420
In fact, the action of the
painting, if there is action,

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:45.620
is distributed equally from
top to bottom, and from side

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:46.970
to side.

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:49.830
And there's no way
that you can complete

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:52.860
your experience of that
picture without letting

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:56.080
your eye wander, or
even your body wander,

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:59.110
all over the surface
of that canvas.

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:02.380
You end up feeling like you're
in a zone with no gravity,

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:04.500
almost as if there
is not a weight.

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.910
Rothko often said that
he liked his paintings

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:09.540
to be hung rather
low to the floor.

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:13.640
The reason for that is that
he really saw these paintings

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:15.950
as something that
mattered in terms

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:19.040
of the physical
presence of the viewer.

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:21.630
The physical presence of the
viewer starts with their feet

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:23.430
being on the floor.

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:27.220
And he wants the paintings
to not literally begin

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:31.670
on the floor, but as close to
that as is reasonably possible,

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:34.100
so that you're almost
standing in the painting,

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:39.700
rather than admiring some kind
of separate object on the wall.

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:42.970
Your space is the painting
space and vice versa.

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:48.870
Like many of the artists in
the Abstract Expressionism era,

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:52.630
Rothko did not want his
paintings to be framed.

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:56.430
Paintings that were made on
easels and then put on frames

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:01.120
were understood to be
illusions of another scene,

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:03.820
of an imagined place.

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:06.380
Rothko and his
peers did not feel

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:08.450
that they were alluding
to another space,

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:11.760
or place, or time with
what they were making.

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:15.020
What they were making
was the reality

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:17.540
that they wanted to
present to the viewer.

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:20.380
And for that reason, it
didn't need the borderline

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:25.010
of a frame separating its
reality from their reality.

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:27.900
What they wanted was
the joint reality

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:31.160
of spectator and painting.
