00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:06.536
&gt;&gt;Where do I need to go to begin my
project? Tara, what is your plan?

00:00:06.996 --> 00:00:12.876
&gt;&gt;Developing a calm, neutral,
assertive voice is part

00:00:12.876 --> 00:00:18.256
of the teacher's own self-regulation,
which allows them to help students

00:00:18.706 --> 00:00:23.786
to be self-regulated and to
be secure in the knowledge

00:00:23.856 --> 00:00:29.036
that the teacher will be receptive
to them, but also in control.

00:00:36.276 --> 00:00:37.266
&gt;&gt;All right, everyone partner up.

00:00:37.886 --> 00:00:40.146
&gt;&gt;The tone of voice we
try to use when we speak

00:00:40.146 --> 00:00:44.046
with our students is what we would
call calm, neutral and assertive.

00:00:44.186 --> 00:00:47.566
&gt;&gt;Show your partner any
emotion, any emotion.

00:00:47.566 --> 00:00:52.286
&gt;&gt;We found it to be immensely important
for helping kids to do the right thing

00:00:52.286 --> 00:00:54.276
and to guide them and to redirect them.

00:00:54.476 --> 00:00:58.816
&gt;&gt;Self-regulation is the way that
we manage ourselves to behave

00:00:58.816 --> 00:01:04.786
in the ways we intend to behave rather
than becoming overwhelmed with anger

00:01:04.786 --> 00:01:07.936
or fear or anxiety and acting out.

00:01:08.546 --> 00:01:09.196
&gt;&gt;Boy: [Screams.]

00:01:09.846 --> 00:01:12.156
&gt;&gt;I have a question, are you
starting a new structure?

00:01:18.156 --> 00:01:20.686
&gt;&gt;If we're talking in a
voice that is too aggressive,

00:01:20.886 --> 00:01:25.156
we might accidentally be using fear
to manipulate children's behavior.

00:01:26.876 --> 00:01:28.086
&gt;&gt;And we're using that.

00:01:28.246 --> 00:01:30.186
&gt;&gt;Let's let him take
off the screws first.

00:01:30.426 --> 00:01:33.946
&gt;&gt;Instead of helping them to
gain that intrinsic motivation

00:01:34.386 --> 00:01:36.276
to do the right thing
for the right reasons.

00:01:36.276 --> 00:01:38.756
&gt;&gt;And sometimes it's not
safe to go to the beach.

00:01:38.756 --> 00:01:40.076
&gt;&gt;Okay, one at a time.

00:01:40.076 --> 00:01:42.296
&gt;&gt;Because there are shark attacks.

00:01:42.296 --> 00:01:44.296
&gt;&gt;Yes, I heard be careful of the sharks.

00:01:44.466 --> 00:01:48.116
&gt;&gt;So the sweet spot is calm,
neutral, assertive and the teachers

00:01:48.116 --> 00:01:51.076
who get the best responses
from kids are the ones

00:01:51.076 --> 00:01:52.766
that have mastered that the best.

00:01:53.186 --> 00:01:54.956
&gt;&gt;All right, we're going to get
ready now for close reading.
