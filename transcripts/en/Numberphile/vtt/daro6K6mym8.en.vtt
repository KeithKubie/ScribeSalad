00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:03.480
So the latest mathematical fact
taking the internet by

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:05.740
storm, well, you may
have seen it.

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:06.655
Let's check this out.

00:00:06.655 --> 00:00:07.930
I don't know if you
have seen it.

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:09.240
It's been all over
the internet.

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:17.390
I'm going to take 1 divided
by 998,001.

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:21.620
If you take that fraction, what
you get, if you do the

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:24.500
decimal for it, you get
something rather remarkable.

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.770
You get every single
three-digit number.

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:31.690
It starts with 0 point,
and it goes 0, 0, 0.

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:32.030
So that's 0.

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:34.340
And it goes 0, 0, 1.

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:35.300
There's 1.

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.620
0, 0, 2--

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.400
0, 0, 3--

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.260
0, 0, 4--

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:42.780
0, 0, 5.

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:48.170
And it will give you every
single there-digit number

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:49.860
except for one.

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.600
It doesn't give you 998.

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.050
Every single three-digit
number except 998.

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:57.340
OK, so let's go on.

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:00.240
So it goes 6, 7, skip a few.

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:03.947
Then it'll go 9, 9, 6--

00:01:03.947 --> 00:01:06.590
9, 9, 7.

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:08.230
There is no 998.

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:11.685
It goes 9, 9, 9, and then
it starts again.

00:01:11.685 --> 00:01:17.590
It'll go back to 0, 0, 0, and
then 0, 0, 1, and goes to

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:18.310
start again.

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:19.560
It repeats.

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:28.420
So, we had a lot of people email
us about this, and one

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:31.760
of our favorite YouTubers,
Vsauce, gives us a little

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:34.030
shoutout and asked us
about it as well.

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:37.260
And so, we had to make
a video about this.

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:38.360
We have seen this before.

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.240
It's not as remarkable
as you may think.

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.030
So this is a repeating
decimal.

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:46.530
For start, I want to show you
that this is part of a family

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.190
of similar facts.

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:54.680
So, one thing to notice
is 998001.

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:59.680
This is actually 999 squared.

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:02.550
Now, this is why we've got a
little family of facts here,

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:10.740
because if I took 1 over 9,801,
this is actually 1 over

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:11.960
99 squared.

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:12.850
Same sort of idea.

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:18.430
And what you would get are all
the numbers, all the two-digit

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:19.400
numbers for that.

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:25.580
So you would get 0.0001020304.

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:26.750
So it's the same idea.

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.740
You get all the two-digit
numbers except

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:32.710
for 98 in that case.

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:33.760
Very similar idea.

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.100
9998001.

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:38.260
It's the same sort of idea.

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:44.060
Again, this is 1 over
9999 squared.

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.760
And you get all the four-digit
numbers.

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:48.330
What about 1 over 9 squared?

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.720
Now, that's the one I really
want to show you, because we

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.350
wanted to make this
a bit simple, OK?

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:53.690
Let's not go straight into it.

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:55.570
Let's take the simplest
example.

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:57.130
1 over 9 squared.

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:59.140
So, 1/81.

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:01.720
That's what we're going to look
at, 1 over 9 squared.

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:04.740
And that will give you all
the one-digit numbers.

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:11.690
0.01234567.

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:13.840
It missed 8.

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.250
9, and then back to 0 again.

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:18.040
It repeats that pattern.

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.190
So, it's the same idea.

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:23.590
So, let's see if we can work out
why this is true, and then

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:25.930
this idea will work for the
other examples that

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:28.250
we've seen so far.

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.700
Right.

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:29.635
Do you want another
piece of paper?

00:03:29.635 --> 00:03:30.570
I do need another
piece of paper.

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:32.340
Let's get you more paper.

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:41.830
So, the easiest explanation for
this is that we could make

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:45.610
any repeating decimal that
we wanted to make.

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:48.450
So, if you wanted to
make, say, this.

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:50.620
Let's say it's going to start
with naught point, and let's

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:51.360
take some digits.

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:54.520
Let's call it a1, that's
the first digit.

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:56.230
a2, the second digit.

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:57.240
a3.

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:00.240
And let's say it's, I don't
know, n digits long.

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:01.940
And then it repeats, so you
get the same thing.

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:04.250
It goes dot, dot, dot, and you
get that repeated over and

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:05.400
over again.

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:06.960
You can make that
quite easily.

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:10.410
All you have to do to make that
is to take this little

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:18.700
sequence, a1, a2, a3, up to an,
and divide it by the same

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:19.380
number of 9s.

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:21.649
You've got n nines here.

00:04:21.649 --> 00:04:24.780
9, 9, 9, whatever
number that is.

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:26.640
So those two things
would be equal.

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:37.846
For our example, then, for 1/81,
we wanted 0.012345679,

00:04:37.846 --> 00:04:40.326
dot, dot, dot.

00:04:40.326 --> 00:04:50.940
012345679 over 999999999.

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:54.960
And that would give you that
decimal representation, and

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:56.260
that does simplify.

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:59.530
That makes a nice 1/81.

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:03.710
Now, you could make any
repeating decimal using that

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:06.895
method, but there is something
special about that, because it

00:05:06.895 --> 00:05:07.990
simplifies so nicely.

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:09.580
It makes such a nice number.

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:13.220
So, not all fractions like this
would make a nice number,

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:14.580
so why is it so nice?

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:16.635
Let me try and show you that.

00:05:16.635 --> 00:05:18.950
So here's a little formula.

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:21.040
If you study mathematics, here's
a little formula that

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:23.200
you will learn, perhaps
at some point, anyway.

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:24.680
Let me show you what it is.

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:26.580
A little expression.

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:33.660
It starts with 1 plus
2x plus 3x squared

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:36.840
plus 4x cubed plus--

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:38.450
and that can go on
forever, OK?

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:41.210
So imagine this little
equation.

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:42.770
Now, here's a little
cool thing.

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:47.650
If your number x is
less than 1--

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:50.290
in fact, this works for negative
numbers as well if

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:52.670
they're greater than minus 1.

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:54.760
What I'm saying is
if the size--

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:58.020
and that symbol means the size
of x-- if it's less than 1,

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:01.200
this actually really
simplifies to

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:02.230
something pretty cool.

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:08.040
It becomes 1 over 1
minus x squared.

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:09.140
And isn't that cool?

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:12.650
That complicated thing that goes
on forever, actually if

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:17.320
your x is less than 1, it's the
same as that, will give

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:18.335
you the same answer.

00:06:18.335 --> 00:06:19.210
That's pretty cool.

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:20.170
That's pretty cool, isn't it?

00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:20.560
Right.

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:25.200
So, we're going to use this
to work out our fraction.

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:33.520
OK, so if I let x equal
1/10, what do I get?

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:35.490
On this side--

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:38.430
I think I'll write
it as a column--

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:40.615
I get 1, 2x.

00:06:40.615 --> 00:06:46.500
So two times 1/10, that's 0.2,
and you add them together.

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:52.370
This one is 3x squared,
which is 0.03.

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:56.880
Plus 4x cubed equals 0.004.

00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:58.150
And you keep going,
dot, dot, dot.

00:06:58.150 --> 00:06:59.510
Keep going forever.

00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:02.110
All this on the left
is equal to--

00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:07.130
on this side, if x is 1/10,
well, let's see.

00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:11.850
1 minus 1/10 is 9/10 squared.

00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:15.775
9/10 squared is 81/100.

00:07:15.775 --> 00:07:20.070
And because it's 1 over that
fraction, you flip it.

00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:24.190
This is equal to 100/81.

00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:31.730
So all this is 1.23456
equals 100/81.

00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:34.180
The one we're interested in
was actually just the same

00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:36.520
thing, but just 100
times smaller.

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:38.780
You just had to shift it across
a couple of places.

00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:42.260
So that's why you've got
such a neat, cool

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:44.160
fraction out of that.

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:45.260
Really simple.

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:47.270
But why is it missing the 8?

00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:48.000
Now, that's interesting.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:48.670
Why is it missing the 8?

00:07:48.670 --> 00:07:49.310
Check this out.

00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:50.885
Let's go a few down.

00:07:50.885 --> 00:07:53.000
Let's do the 8.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.530
Naught point-- let me see,
I'm going to need six

00:07:55.530 --> 00:07:58.690
of those, then 8.

00:07:58.690 --> 00:08:00.072
Let's do the next one.

00:08:00.072 --> 00:08:04.490
Naught point seven more.

00:08:04.490 --> 00:08:05.930
Then there's the 9.

00:08:05.930 --> 00:08:09.280
And if I want to add 10,
it's going to 0--

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:10.360
try again--

00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:11.312
point.

00:08:11.312 --> 00:08:17.150
Now 0000000--

00:08:17.150 --> 00:08:20.740
now, I want to write 010 here,
but there is no symbol for 10.

00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:22.190
I can't write 010.

00:08:22.190 --> 00:08:25.140
I have to write 10, like that.

00:08:25.140 --> 00:08:27.480
Now, if you add this all
together, you just add up the

00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:29.750
columns, just a column
at a time, can you

00:08:29.750 --> 00:08:31.330
see it carries on?

00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:33.049
Like you learned at school,
this carries on.

00:08:33.049 --> 00:08:38.220
So this 1 plus 9, the 9 turns
into a 10, so that carries on.

00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:41.564
So you get 1 plus 8, and
that becomes a 9.

00:08:41.564 --> 00:08:43.010
Your 8 becomes a 9.

00:08:43.010 --> 00:08:45.760
Your missing 8 turns into
a 9 because of all

00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:47.250
this carrying on.

00:08:47.250 --> 00:08:49.930
So all this is like a
row of dominoes .

00:08:49.930 --> 00:08:51.910
You get a carry on, carry
on, carry on.

00:08:51.910 --> 00:08:55.850
Your 8 turns into a 9, it
disappears, and you get that

00:08:55.850 --> 00:08:58.380
number we discovered.

00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:01.760
And the same sort of idea will
work for all those other

00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:02.980
fractions that we looked at.

00:09:02.980 --> 00:09:08.865
So the 1/998,001 is
the same idea.

00:09:08.865 --> 00:09:11.050
You can prove the same thing
with the same idea.

00:09:11.050 --> 00:09:12.590
It's a cool fact, isn't it?

00:09:12.590 --> 00:09:14.270
It's a cool, little fact.

00:09:14.270 --> 00:09:15.850
Yeah, I like the fact.

00:09:15.850 --> 00:09:19.830
And it's not completely trivial,
but you can make any

00:09:19.830 --> 00:09:22.070
repeating decimal that you want
to make, so that's not

00:09:22.070 --> 00:09:22.810
particularly remarkable.

00:09:22.810 --> 00:09:25.300
Why has it suddenly gone
on the internet?

00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:26.670
Who knows?

00:09:26.670 --> 00:09:28.410
You get these things
ever now and again.

00:09:28.410 --> 00:09:31.260
These things go viral.

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:35.210
Mathematicians can roll their
eyes and go, oh, no, not this.

00:09:35.210 --> 00:09:37.080
Oh, you're boring.

00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:40.230
But every now and again, for no
reason as far as I can see,

00:09:40.230 --> 00:09:41.480
you get this happening.
