so welcome to this this final session of
 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.379
so welcome to this this final session of
the of the very parallel discussions

the of the very parallel discussions
 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.810
the of the very parallel discussions
that we are having are having discussion

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820
that we are having are having discussion
 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.019
that we are having are having discussion
here with my good friend David about

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029
here with my good friend David about
 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.980
here with my good friend David about
well we have an official title are there

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990
well we have an official title are there
 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.759
well we have an official title are there
physical facts or only interpretations

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:27.769
physical facts or only interpretations
 

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:31.359
physical facts or only interpretations
that sounded the very kind of post

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:31.369
that sounded the very kind of post
 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:34.190
that sounded the very kind of post
postmodern view on science right but

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200
postmodern view on science right but
 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.799

we're gonna take the pre modernist point

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809
we're gonna take the pre modernist point
 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.080
we're gonna take the pre modernist point
of view so you are here in the

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090

cartoons has two scientists is a very
 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.580
cartoons has two scientists is a very
complicated lab and they say all very

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590
complicated lab and they say all very
 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.150
complicated lab and they say all very
well colleague this all works does it

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160
well colleague this all works does it
 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.649
well colleague this all works does it
also work in theory and because I want

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659
also work in theory and because I want
 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.359
also work in theory and because I want
to be in the end to say nature is the

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369
to be in the end to say nature is the
 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:12.950
to be in the end to say nature is the
final arbiter of truth but it's also

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960
final arbiter of truth but it's also
 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.200
final arbiter of truth but it's also
something about the nature of truth know

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210
something about the nature of truth know
 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.390
something about the nature of truth know
what's how do we describe it and what's

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400
what's how do we describe it and what's
 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.740
what's how do we describe it and what's
the role of theory and so can you

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750
the role of theory and so can you
 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.160
the role of theory and so can you
perhaps you say a few things about what

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170
perhaps you say a few things about what
 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.230
perhaps you say a few things about what
it means to be a theorist because I

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240
it means to be a theorist because I
 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.910
it means to be a theorist because I
think up to now a lot of the discussions

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920
think up to now a lot of the discussions
 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.560
think up to now a lot of the discussions
about facts which are just the data

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570
about facts which are just the data
 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.539
about facts which are just the data
points but we do much more than just

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549
points but we do much more than just
 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.999
points but we do much more than just
data points now we draw a curve through

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009
data points now we draw a curve through
 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.060
data points now we draw a curve through
all in the end of science is to

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070
all in the end of science is to
 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.069
all in the end of science is to
understand to understand exactly well

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079
understand to understand exactly well
 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.170
understand to understand exactly well
two things to understand to satisfy our

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180
two things to understand to satisfy our
 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.490
two things to understand to satisfy our
curiosity that know how and and

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:45.500
curiosity that know how and and
 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.530
curiosity that know how and and
sometimes why it works but the other

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540
sometimes why it works but the other
 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.840
sometimes why it works but the other
thing of course is to control yes we

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850
thing of course is to control yes we
 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.300
thing of course is to control yes we
mean I think ever from an evolutionary

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310
mean I think ever from an evolutionary
 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.840
mean I think ever from an evolutionary
point of view scientific method after

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850
point of view scientific method after
 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.590
point of view scientific method after
many faulty turns that was discovered

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600
many faulty turns that was discovered
 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.399
many faulty turns that was discovered
and process it was so effective that it

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:03.409
and process it was so effective that it
 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:07.300

evolved rapidly because it enabled

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:07.310
evolved rapidly because it enabled
 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:10.940
evolved rapidly because it enabled
humans Homo sapiens to control

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950
humans Homo sapiens to control
 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.830
humans Homo sapiens to control
that are in better the physical world

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840
that are in better the physical world
 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.860
that are in better the physical world
and you know destroy other species for

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870
and you know destroy other species for
 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.910
and you know destroy other species for
example and change the earth and kill

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920
example and change the earth and kill
 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.790
example and change the earth and kill
other humans and so on so there are two

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800
other humans and so on so there are two
 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.130
other humans and so on so there are two
goals understanding and controlling but

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140
goals understanding and controlling but
 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.170
goals understanding and controlling but
and for the scientists understanding is

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180
and for the scientists understanding is
 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.120
and for the scientists understanding is
so important of course that's but this

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130
so important of course that's but this
 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.220
so important of course that's but this
is this understanding sometimes a

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230
is this understanding sometimes a
 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.140
is this understanding sometimes a
painful process so for instance if you

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150
painful process so for instance if you
 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.259
painful process so for instance if you
look in our field particle physics

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:36.269
look in our field particle physics
 

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:38.420
look in our field particle physics
now think of our say quantum mechanics

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430
now think of our say quantum mechanics
 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.550
now think of our say quantum mechanics
you know we now celebrate as a great

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560
you know we now celebrate as a great
 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.949
you know we now celebrate as a great
success but it was a kind of painful

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959
success but it was a kind of painful
 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:45.020
success but it was a kind of painful
delivery and in some sense it also led

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030
delivery and in some sense it also led
 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.660
delivery and in some sense it also led
to the loss of certain things for

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670
to the loss of certain things for
 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:49.069
to the loss of certain things for
instance the fact that we couldn't

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:49.079
instance the fact that we couldn't
 

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:51.920
instance the fact that we couldn't
perhaps predict or understand certain

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930
perhaps predict or understand certain
 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:54.140
perhaps predict or understand certain
things that we wore and date for some

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150
things that we wore and date for some
 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.229
things that we wore and date for some
people it's still very painful yes

00:02:56.229 --> 00:02:56.239
people it's still very painful yes
 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:59.509
people it's still very painful yes
personally I don't find it painful at

00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519
personally I don't find it painful at
 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:02.330
personally I don't find it painful at
all but you know some of my great heroes

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340
all but you know some of my great heroes
 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:06.350
all but you know some of my great heroes
like Einstein was tortured by the change

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360
like Einstein was tortured by the change
 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:09.550
like Einstein was tortured by the change
of world view that quantum mechanics

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.560
of world view that quantum mechanics
 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.640
of world view that quantum mechanics
required and could never accept it I

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:12.650
required and could never accept it I
 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:14.509
required and could never accept it I
mean the fact that there's only

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:14.519
mean the fact that there's only
 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:16.430
mean the fact that there's only
probabilistic statements and and you

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440
probabilistic statements and and you
 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:17.470
probabilistic statements and and you
don't have this

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:17.480
don't have this
 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:20.300
don't have this
yes eyes image of how things you know

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310
yes eyes image of how things you know
 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:21.740
yes eyes image of how things you know
it's a little more complicated in that

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750
it's a little more complicated in that
 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:31.009
it's a little more complicated in that
and and in some sense the quantum world

00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:31.019
and and in some sense the quantum world
 

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:33.410
and and in some sense the quantum world
is totally deterministic you have a

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420
is totally deterministic you have a
 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:37.160
is totally deterministic you have a
deterministic equation for for the

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170
deterministic equation for for the
 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:38.809
deterministic equation for for the
evolution of States in a Hilbert space

00:03:38.809 --> 00:03:38.819
evolution of States in a Hilbert space
 

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:43.340
evolution of States in a Hilbert space
however in order to discuss measurements

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:43.350
however in order to discuss measurements
 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:49.210
however in order to discuss measurements
and how we how we make contact with the

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:49.220
and how we how we make contact with the
 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:53.240
and how we how we make contact with the
observable world we are forced to

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250
observable world we are forced to
 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:57.500
observable world we are forced to
introduce statistical statements yes

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510
introduce statistical statements yes
 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:00.710
introduce statistical statements yes
it's a change of point of view still one

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720
it's a change of point of view still one
 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:04.069
it's a change of point of view still one
that 90 years later quantum mechanics is

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:04.079
that 90 years later quantum mechanics is
 

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:08.949
that 90 years later quantum mechanics is
still very young I don't think we fully

00:04:08.949 --> 00:04:08.959
still very young I don't think we fully
 

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:12.740
still very young I don't think we fully
deeply understand in a way that will

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:12.750
deeply understand in a way that will
 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:14.150
deeply understand in a way that will
probably take another a few hundred

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:14.160
probably take another a few hundred
 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.940
probably take another a few hundred
years cut deep concepts in physics take

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:16.950
years cut deep concepts in physics take
 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:20.509
years cut deep concepts in physics take
a long time to assemble to truly grasp

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:20.519
a long time to assemble to truly grasp
 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:24.580
a long time to assemble to truly grasp
so indeed being forced to

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:24.590
so indeed being forced to
 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:27.700
so indeed being forced to
change one's fundamental concept is very

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:27.710
change one's fundamental concept is very
 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:30.189
change one's fundamental concept is very
difficult difficult and politics it's

00:04:30.189 --> 00:04:30.199
difficult difficult and politics it's
 

00:04:30.199 --> 00:04:34.060
difficult difficult and politics it's
difficult in family life it's it's very

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:34.070
difficult in family life it's it's very
 

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:36.969
difficult in family life it's it's very
hard to change one's point of view yes

00:04:36.969 --> 00:04:36.979
hard to change one's point of view yes
 

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:39.580
hard to change one's point of view yes
we all know that change one point of

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:39.590
we all know that change one point of

right and we're trying to modify that
we're being forced by our attempts to to

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:11.030
we're being forced by our attempts to to
 

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:13.150
we're being forced by our attempts to to
go beyond our present theory and to

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:13.160
go beyond our present theory and to
 

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:14.530
go beyond our present theory and to
confront some of the mysteries of

to change our basic concepts of space

00:05:18.969 --> 00:05:18.979
to change our basic concepts of space
 

00:05:18.979 --> 00:05:21.610
to change our basic concepts of space
and time that is a very difficult

Shine questions that a young child will
 

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:22.690
Shine questions that a young child will
ask yes they were all basically

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:22.700
ask yes they were all basically
 

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:24.460
ask yes they were all basically
unanswerable right because we didn't

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:24.470
unanswerable right because we didn't
 

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:26.650
unanswerable right because we didn't
have atoms we didn't have molecules and

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:26.660
have atoms we didn't have molecules and
 

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:28.210
have atoms we didn't have molecules and
we couldn't calculate any of the

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:28.220
we couldn't calculate any of the

right and it's interesting in fact when

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:32.360
right and it's interesting in fact when
 

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:35.440
right and it's interesting in fact when
you go back to scientific literature of

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:35.450
you go back to scientific literature of
 

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:37.930
you go back to scientific literature of
a century ago or more most scientists

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:37.940
a century ago or more most scientists
 

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:38.380
a century ago or more most scientists
didn't

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:38.390
didn't
 

00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:40.420
didn't
ask those questions no because they sort

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:40.430
ask those questions no because they sort
 

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:42.100
ask those questions no because they sort
of know you know they didn't know how to

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:42.110
of know you know they didn't know how to
 

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:43.660
of know you know they didn't know how to
approach the school they were just so

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:43.670
approach the school they were just so
 

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:45.700

question yes so but the realm of what is

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:49.820
question yes so but the realm of what is

scientific questions has grown
 

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:54.100
scientific questions has grown
enormously many of which we answered

00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:54.110
enormously many of which we answered
 

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:55.990
enormously many of which we answered
like what is life yes I'm here that's

00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:56.000
like what is life yes I'm here that's
 

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.930
like what is life yes I'm here that's
amazing we now know what life is we're

00:06:58.930 --> 00:06:58.940
amazing we now know what life is we're
 

00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:00.550
amazing we now know what life is we're
not exactly sure how it began on earth

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:00.560
not exactly sure how it began on earth
 

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:03.880
not exactly sure how it began on earth
but we know what it is or the origins of

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:03.890
but we know what it is or the origins of
 

00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:05.760
but we know what it is or the origins of
you know the the cosmological

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:05.770
you know the the cosmological
 

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:08.110
you know the the cosmological
irregularities I would say that's your

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:08.120
irregularities I would say that's your
 

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:10.090

the formation of structure in the

00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:10.100
the formation of structure in the
 

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:13.270
the formation of structure in the
universe yeah it's totally science is

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:13.280
universe yeah it's totally science is
 

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:14.820

so can we briefly talk about what is

00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:17.300
so can we briefly talk about what is
 

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:19.630
so can we briefly talk about what is
kind of the the compass that guides us

00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:19.640
kind of the the compass that guides us

theorists it's it's mathematical beauty
 

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:30.130
theorists it's it's mathematical beauty
I mean it's the console what's the role

00:07:30.130 --> 00:07:30.140
I mean it's the console what's the role
 

00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:31.650
I mean it's the console what's the role
of mathematics to your point of view

00:07:31.650 --> 00:07:31.660
of mathematics to your point of view
 

00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:34.300
of mathematics to your point of view
well I regard mathematics in much like

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:34.310
well I regard mathematics in much like
 

00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:37.360
well I regard mathematics in much like
language and logic yes the same you know

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:37.370
language and logic yes the same you know
 

00:07:37.370 --> 00:07:40.500
language and logic yes the same you know
it's simply the mental tools we have

00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:40.510
it's simply the mental tools we have
 

00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:43.750
it's simply the mental tools we have
acquired evolutionary to comprehend the

have imagined different universes with
 

00:07:55.850 --> 00:07:58.330
have imagined different universes with
different logic mathematics yes so there

00:07:58.330 --> 00:07:58.340
different logic mathematics yes so there
 

00:07:58.340 --> 00:08:02.800
different logic mathematics yes so there
are tools but we have that they are

00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:02.810
are tools but we have that they are
 

00:08:02.810 --> 00:08:05.890
are tools but we have that they are
tools that I believe developed because

that they work so well rather than
 

00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:14.050
that they work so well rather than
actual world I don't because we

00:08:14.050 --> 00:08:14.060
actual world I don't because we
 

00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:15.820
actual world I don't because we

if you try to analyze what do you mean

00:08:53.690 --> 00:08:53.700
if you try to analyze what do you mean
 

00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:55.970
if you try to analyze what do you mean
by mathematical beauty yes so you know

00:08:55.970 --> 00:08:55.980
by mathematical beauty yes so you know
 

00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:58.640

it's more than that what do we mean by

00:09:13.130 --> 00:09:13.140
it's more than that what do we mean by
 

00:09:13.140 --> 00:09:16.820
it's more than that what do we mean by
beauty yes in mathematics this kind of

00:09:16.820 --> 00:09:16.830
beauty yes in mathematics this kind of
 

00:09:16.830 --> 00:09:18.080
beauty yes in mathematics this kind of
elegance that you're referring to I

00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:18.090
elegance that you're referring to I
 

00:09:18.090 --> 00:09:20.750
elegance that you're referring to I
think it you know my impression when I

00:09:20.750 --> 00:09:20.760
think it you know my impression when I
 

00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:22.340
think it you know my impression when I
met when a mathematician says an

00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:22.350

it's the power is that it's powerful

00:09:29.510 --> 00:09:29.520
it's the power is that it's powerful
 

00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:33.140
it's the power is that it's powerful
yeah so beauty first approximation at

00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:33.150
yeah so beauty first approximation at
 

00:09:33.150 --> 00:09:35.240
yeah so beauty first approximation at

and that's sort of what we mean in

00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:37.410
and that's sort of what we mean in
 

00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:39.530
and that's sort of what we mean in
physics as well I mean one of the

00:09:39.530 --> 00:09:39.540
physics as well I mean one of the
 

00:09:39.540 --> 00:09:44.510

I'm not it's not really surprising if if

00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:13.730
I'm not it's not really surprising if if

I don't find it totally surprising that

00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:20.370
I don't find it totally surprising that
 

00:10:20.370 --> 00:10:22.400
I don't find it totally surprising that
the world is comprehensible hmm I would

00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:22.410
the world is comprehensible hmm I would
 

00:10:22.410 --> 00:10:25.220
the world is comprehensible hmm I would
find it pretty bizarre if it wasn't yes

00:10:25.220 --> 00:10:25.230
find it pretty bizarre if it wasn't yes
 

00:10:25.230 --> 00:10:28.370
find it pretty bizarre if it wasn't yes
would that mean yes so it's not too

00:10:28.370 --> 00:10:28.380
would that mean yes so it's not too
 

00:10:28.380 --> 00:10:30.860
would that mean yes so it's not too
surprising but it but I do admit that

00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:30.870
surprising but it but I do admit that
 

00:10:30.870 --> 00:10:32.780
surprising but it but I do admit that
it's just absolutely wonderful and

well it's perhaps not surprising that

00:10:35.660 --> 00:10:35.670
well it's perhaps not surprising that
 

00:10:35.670 --> 00:10:38.270
well it's perhaps not surprising that
it's in at some level comprehensible but

00:10:38.270 --> 00:10:38.280
it's in at some level comprehensible but
 

00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:41.330
it's in at some level comprehensible but
isn't it kind of surprising that for us

00:10:41.330 --> 00:10:41.340
isn't it kind of surprising that for us
 

00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:43.220
isn't it kind of surprising that for us
human beings who are you know we have a

primitive species which our politicians
 

00:11:00.780 --> 00:11:05.560
primitive species which our politicians
are are exhibiting yes

00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:05.570
 

00:11:05.570 --> 00:11:08.600
what we have going for us is the thing

00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:08.610
what we have going for us is the thing
 

00:11:08.610 --> 00:11:09.920
what we have going for us is the thing
you start out with it with it was

00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:09.930
you start out with it with it was
 

00:11:09.930 --> 00:11:11.450
you start out with it with it was
mathematics and language so what

00:11:11.450 --> 00:11:11.460
mathematics and language so what
 

00:11:11.460 --> 00:11:14.840
mathematics and language so what
differentiates us from those from our

is the facility of language whose most

00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:21.330
is the facility of language whose most
 

00:11:21.330 --> 00:11:23.780
is the facility of language whose most
advanced form is mathematics and that is

00:11:23.780 --> 00:11:23.790
advanced form is mathematics and that is
 

00:11:23.790 --> 00:11:27.110
advanced form is mathematics and that is
a powerful tool with somewhat of an

utter sentences that no one has ever
 

00:11:32.580 --> 00:11:34.580
utter sentences that no one has ever

thing we have seen this with such you

00:11:37.670 --> 00:11:37.680
thing we have seen this with such you
 

00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:40.340
thing we have seen this with such you
know the story of science is also very

00:11:40.340 --> 00:11:40.350
know the story of science is also very
 

00:11:40.350 --> 00:11:42.830
know the story of science is also very
much a story of transition through

00:11:42.830 --> 00:11:42.840
much a story of transition through
 

00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:44.960

somehow move to a next level

00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:44.970
somehow move to a next level
 

00:11:44.970 --> 00:11:47.150
somehow move to a next level
I think fine and somewhat surprised it

00:11:47.150 --> 00:11:47.160
I think fine and somewhat surprised it
 

00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:48.830
I think fine and somewhat surprised it
very nicely that they said you know well

00:11:48.830 --> 00:11:48.840
very nicely that they said you know well
 

00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:50.360
very nicely that they said you know well
everything fits and then certainly

00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:50.370
everything fits and then certainly
 

00:11:50.370 --> 00:11:52.400
everything fits and then certainly
something doesn't fit and you think oh

00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:52.410
something doesn't fit and you think oh
 

00:11:52.410 --> 00:11:54.710
something doesn't fit and you think oh
wait a moment this is a crisis and then

00:11:54.710 --> 00:11:54.720
wait a moment this is a crisis and then
 

00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:56.750
wait a moment this is a crisis and then
by somehow going to the next level

00:11:56.750 --> 00:11:56.760
by somehow going to the next level
 

00:11:56.760 --> 00:12:00.530
by somehow going to the next level
probably sometimes also by losing some

00:12:00.530 --> 00:12:00.540
probably sometimes also by losing some
 

00:12:00.540 --> 00:12:03.020
probably sometimes also by losing some
you you gain new insights and then

00:12:03.020 --> 00:12:03.030
you you gain new insights and then
 

00:12:03.030 --> 00:12:04.820
you you gain new insights and then
becomes beautiful again in the way like

00:12:04.820 --> 00:12:04.830
becomes beautiful again in the way like
 

00:12:04.830 --> 00:12:07.250
becomes beautiful again in the way like
quantum theory is beautiful but it's at

00:12:07.250 --> 00:12:07.260
quantum theory is beautiful but it's at
 

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:09.500
quantum theory is beautiful but it's at
different level as quiet I think I still

00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:09.510
different level as quiet I think I still
 

00:12:09.510 --> 00:12:11.570
different level as quiet I think I still
don't agree with you that we lose

00:12:11.570 --> 00:12:11.580
don't agree with you that we lose
 

00:12:11.580 --> 00:12:13.970
don't agree with you that we lose
something yeah we lose something that

00:12:13.970 --> 00:12:13.980
something yeah we lose something that
 

00:12:13.980 --> 00:12:17.570
something yeah we lose something that
was incorrect or wrong wave so something

00:12:17.570 --> 00:12:17.580
was incorrect or wrong wave so something
 

00:12:17.580 --> 00:12:19.040
was incorrect or wrong wave so something
to lose yeah it's a good thing to yes

00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:19.050
to lose yeah it's a good thing to yes
 

00:12:19.050 --> 00:12:21.830
to lose yeah it's a good thing to yes
because it really wasn't didn't work so

00:12:21.830 --> 00:12:21.840
because it really wasn't didn't work so
 

00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:25.280
because it really wasn't didn't work so
well so it's not a bad idea to lose bad

00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:25.290
well so it's not a bad idea to lose bad
 

00:12:25.290 --> 00:12:31.400
well so it's not a bad idea to lose bad
ideas but yeah it there might we might

00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:31.410
ideas but yeah it there might we might
 

00:12:31.410 --> 00:12:33.470
ideas but yeah it there might we might

subject so so you talked about you know

00:15:29.259 --> 00:15:29.269
subject so so you talked about you know
 

00:15:29.269 --> 00:15:30.309
subject so so you talked about you know
the this morning

00:15:30.309 --> 00:15:30.319
the this morning

basically equating truth is a scientific

00:15:32.860 --> 00:15:32.870
basically equating truth is a scientific
 

00:15:32.870 --> 00:15:35.019
basically equating truth is a scientific
method and so if we talk about you know

00:15:35.019 --> 00:15:35.029
method and so if we talk about you know
 

00:15:35.029 --> 00:15:38.619
method and so if we talk about you know
spreading in some sense not the perhaps

00:15:38.619 --> 00:15:38.629
spreading in some sense not the perhaps
 

00:15:38.629 --> 00:15:41.050
spreading in some sense not the perhaps
the facts of science but the methods of

00:15:41.050 --> 00:15:41.060
the facts of science but the methods of
 

00:15:41.060 --> 00:15:42.429
the facts of science but the methods of
science so I want to share a little

00:15:42.429 --> 00:15:42.439
science so I want to share a little
 

00:15:42.439 --> 00:15:45.059
science so I want to share a little
anecdote that was on television and

00:15:45.059 --> 00:15:45.069
anecdote that was on television and
 

00:15:45.069 --> 00:15:47.980
anecdote that was on television and
showing little experiments that you can

00:15:47.980 --> 00:15:47.990
showing little experiments that you can
 

00:15:47.990 --> 00:15:50.170
showing little experiments that you can
do with children so I had a little

00:15:50.170 --> 00:15:50.180
do with children so I had a little
 

00:15:50.180 --> 00:15:52.210
do with children so I had a little
balloon filled with water you can do it

00:15:52.210 --> 00:15:52.220
balloon filled with water you can do it
 

00:15:52.220 --> 00:15:55.090
balloon filled with water you can do it
at home and you try to with the light or

00:15:55.090 --> 00:15:55.100
at home and you try to with the light or
 

00:15:55.100 --> 00:15:56.769
at home and you try to with the light or
trying to burn a hole in it and it

00:15:56.769 --> 00:15:56.779
trying to burn a hole in it and it
 

00:15:56.779 --> 00:15:58.449
trying to burn a hole in it and it
doesn't work and so you can do the

00:15:58.449 --> 00:15:58.459
doesn't work and so you can do the
 

00:15:58.459 --> 00:15:59.889
doesn't work and so you can do the
experiment I should have done it here

00:15:59.889 --> 00:15:59.899
experiment I should have done it here
 

00:15:59.899 --> 00:16:03.850
experiment I should have done it here
and it's absolute drama and then you can

00:16:03.850 --> 00:16:03.860
and it's absolute drama and then you can
 

00:16:03.860 --> 00:16:05.410
and it's absolute drama and then you can
explain a little bit why this happens

00:16:05.410 --> 00:16:05.420
explain a little bit why this happens
 

00:16:05.420 --> 00:16:07.600
explain a little bit why this happens
because has to do with the heat capacity

00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:07.610
because has to do with the heat capacity
 

00:16:07.610 --> 00:16:09.759
because has to do with the heat capacity
of water so I had a nice little spiel

00:16:09.759 --> 00:16:09.769
of water so I had a nice little spiel
 

00:16:09.769 --> 00:16:11.619
of water so I had a nice little spiel
there and the next morning I got an

00:16:11.619 --> 00:16:11.629
there and the next morning I got an
 

00:16:11.629 --> 00:16:14.170
there and the next morning I got an
email from a very famous Dutch scientist

00:16:14.170 --> 00:16:14.180
email from a very famous Dutch scientist
 

00:16:14.180 --> 00:16:15.869
email from a very famous Dutch scientist
and he said I loved your presentation

00:16:15.869 --> 00:16:15.879
and he said I loved your presentation
 

00:16:15.879 --> 00:16:18.749
and he said I loved your presentation
but your explanation was totally wrong

00:16:18.749 --> 00:16:18.759
but your explanation was totally wrong
 

00:16:18.759 --> 00:16:21.879
but your explanation was totally wrong
you didn't show the experiment to

00:16:21.879 --> 00:16:21.889
you didn't show the experiment to
 

00:16:21.889 --> 00:16:24.220
you didn't show the experiment to
explain anything about heat capacity and

00:16:24.220 --> 00:16:24.230
explain anything about heat capacity and
 

00:16:24.230 --> 00:16:26.790
explain anything about heat capacity and
thermodynamics you did the experiment

00:16:26.790 --> 00:16:26.800
thermodynamics you did the experiment
 

00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:29.230
thermodynamics you did the experiment
because you showed that you can trust

00:16:29.230 --> 00:16:29.240
because you showed that you can trust
 

00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:31.629
because you showed that you can trust
science there was a law of nature that

00:16:31.629 --> 00:16:31.639
science there was a law of nature that
 

00:16:31.639 --> 00:16:33.699
science there was a law of nature that
prevented this magic trick from going

00:16:33.699 --> 00:16:33.709
prevented this magic trick from going
 

00:16:33.709 --> 00:16:36.699
prevented this magic trick from going
wrong so this is really about can we in

00:16:36.699 --> 00:16:36.709
wrong so this is really about can we in
 

00:16:36.709 --> 00:16:39.549
wrong so this is really about can we in
some sense explain the scientific method

00:16:39.549 --> 00:16:39.559
some sense explain the scientific method
 

00:16:39.559 --> 00:16:42.449
some sense explain the scientific method
because I feel this really attention by

00:16:42.449 --> 00:16:42.459
because I feel this really attention by
 

00:16:42.459 --> 00:16:45.400
because I feel this really attention by
explaining the latest results in science

00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:45.410
explaining the latest results in science
 

00:16:45.410 --> 00:16:47.019
explaining the latest results in science
which might be very complicated

00:16:47.019 --> 00:16:47.029
which might be very complicated
 

00:16:47.029 --> 00:16:49.960
which might be very complicated
only few experts will understand it but

00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:49.970
only few experts will understand it but
 

00:16:49.970 --> 00:16:51.939
only few experts will understand it but
as you said in the scientific method is

00:16:51.939 --> 00:16:51.949
as you said in the scientific method is
 

00:16:51.949 --> 00:16:55.389
as you said in the scientific method is
much more it's a way to understand the

00:16:55.389 --> 00:16:55.399
much more it's a way to understand the
 

00:16:55.399 --> 00:16:57.009
much more it's a way to understand the
world it's something you can apply in

00:16:57.009 --> 00:16:57.019
world it's something you can apply in
 

00:16:57.019 --> 00:16:59.619
world it's something you can apply in
various walks of life so how can we kind

00:16:59.619 --> 00:16:59.629
various walks of life so how can we kind
 

00:16:59.629 --> 00:17:02.350
various walks of life so how can we kind
of teach the method in instead of just

00:17:02.350 --> 00:17:02.360
of teach the method in instead of just
 

00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:05.919
of teach the method in instead of just
focusing on the results it's a wonderful

00:17:05.919 --> 00:17:05.929
focusing on the results it's a wonderful
 

00:17:05.929 --> 00:17:07.600
focusing on the results it's a wonderful
question and I certainly don't have the

00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:07.610
question and I certainly don't have the
 

00:17:07.610 --> 00:17:12.370
question and I certainly don't have the
answer I'm a little distraught by the

00:17:12.370 --> 00:17:12.380
answer I'm a little distraught by the
 

00:17:12.380 --> 00:17:16.090
answer I'm a little distraught by the
fact that you know we have improved math

00:17:16.090 --> 00:17:16.100
fact that you know we have improved math
 

00:17:16.100 --> 00:17:19.260
fact that you know we have improved math
education yeah this last century you

00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:19.270
education yeah this last century you
 

00:17:19.270 --> 00:17:22.230
education yeah this last century you
know essentially ago very few people

00:17:22.230 --> 00:17:22.240
know essentially ago very few people
 

00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:24.520

with half perhaps you we could argue

00:17:48.140 --> 00:17:48.150
with half perhaps you we could argue
 

00:17:48.150 --> 00:17:51.020
with half perhaps you we could argue
that the where Segoe or hundred years

00:17:51.020 --> 00:17:51.030
that the where Segoe or hundred years
 

00:17:51.030 --> 00:17:53.659
that the where Segoe or hundred years
ago it was easier for scientists to

00:17:53.659 --> 00:17:53.669
ago it was easier for scientists to
 

00:17:53.669 --> 00:17:56.330
ago it was easier for scientists to
advise politicians and policy makers

00:17:56.330 --> 00:17:56.340

probably in other word they had a more

00:17:57.710 --> 00:17:57.720
probably in other word they had a more
 

00:17:57.720 --> 00:18:00.799
probably in other word they had a more
direct communication than nowadays yes

00:18:00.799 --> 00:18:00.809
direct communication than nowadays yes
 

00:18:00.809 --> 00:18:03.409
direct communication than nowadays yes
so nowadays I think it was more

00:18:03.409 --> 00:18:03.419
so nowadays I think it was more
 

00:18:03.419 --> 00:18:08.390
so nowadays I think it was more

this this is could be a dystopia that I

00:18:27.169 --> 00:18:27.179
this this is could be a dystopia that I
 

00:18:27.179 --> 00:18:29.180

a car anymore yes but and and so what

00:19:21.890 --> 00:19:21.900
a car anymore yes but and and so what
 

00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:25.850
a car anymore yes but and and so what
happens is that people of who might be

00:19:25.850 --> 00:19:25.860
happens is that people of who might be
 

00:19:25.860 --> 00:19:28.010
happens is that people of who might be
attracted to science or interest in how

00:19:28.010 --> 00:19:28.020
attracted to science or interest in how

kind of a computer program it was used

00:19:41.630 --> 00:19:41.640
kind of a computer program it was used
 

00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:44.149
kind of a computer program it was used
for children to learn about mechanics so

00:19:44.149 --> 00:19:44.159

see it with your own eyes I mean I'm not

00:19:57.140 --> 00:19:57.150
see it with your own eyes I mean I'm not
 

00:19:57.150 --> 00:19:59.720
see it with your own eyes I mean I'm not
sure how you ever develop physical means

00:19:59.720 --> 00:19:59.730
sure how you ever develop physical means
 

00:19:59.730 --> 00:20:03.590

you know as theoretical physicists we

00:20:03.590 --> 00:20:03.600
you know as theoretical physicists we
 

00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:05.810
you know as theoretical physicists we
were all required to take an

00:20:05.810 --> 00:20:05.820
were all required to take an
 

00:20:05.820 --> 00:20:07.880
were all required to take an
experimental lab that was really painful

00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:07.890
experimental lab that was really painful
 

00:20:07.890 --> 00:20:10.130
experimental lab that was really painful
yeah it was painful but boy was it

00:20:10.130 --> 00:20:10.140
yeah it was painful but boy was it
 

00:20:10.140 --> 00:20:12.680
yeah it was painful but boy was it
important you actually feel how things

00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:12.690
important you actually feel how things
 

00:20:12.690 --> 00:20:16.280
important you actually feel how things
work and but maybe there is a kind of a

00:20:16.280 --> 00:20:16.290
work and but maybe there is a kind of a
 

00:20:16.290 --> 00:20:18.230
work and but maybe there is a kind of a

it like proto scientists so you talked

00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:29.370
it like proto scientists so you talked
 

00:20:29.370 --> 00:20:31.280
it like proto scientists so you talked
about the natural skepticism

you were a professor you would declare

00:20:50.690 --> 00:20:50.700
you were a professor you would declare
 

00:20:50.700 --> 00:20:52.160
you were a professor you would declare
something and everybody would you know

00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:52.170
something and everybody would you know
 

00:20:52.170 --> 00:20:54.020
something and everybody would you know
would believe it because you were the

00:20:54.020 --> 00:20:54.030
would believe it because you were the
 

00:20:54.030 --> 00:20:55.910
would believe it because you were the
professor these days I'll throw in some

00:20:55.910 --> 00:20:55.920
professor these days I'll throw in some
 

00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:57.560
professor these days I'll throw in some
countries in some countries still true

00:20:57.560 --> 00:20:57.570
countries in some countries still true
 

00:20:57.570 --> 00:20:59.270
countries in some countries still true
but it's probably that's a losing fight

00:20:59.270 --> 00:20:59.280
but it's probably that's a losing fight
 

00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:02.030
but it's probably that's a losing fight
I think these days will never come back

00:21:02.030 --> 00:21:02.040
I think these days will never come back
 

00:21:02.040 --> 00:21:04.160
I think these days will never come back
but so in some sense that people have at

00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:04.170
but so in some sense that people have at
 

00:21:04.170 --> 00:21:07.280
but so in some sense that people have at
least a kernel of a scientific or

00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:07.290
least a kernel of a scientific or
 

00:21:07.290 --> 00:21:09.050
least a kernel of a scientific or
skeptical attitude it's that's something

00:21:09.050 --> 00:21:09.060
skeptical attitude it's that's something
 

00:21:09.060 --> 00:21:12.440
skeptical attitude it's that's something
that we could work with we encourage

00:21:12.440 --> 00:21:12.450
that we could work with we encourage
 

00:21:12.450 --> 00:21:14.510
that we could work with we encourage
that on the one hand yes and the other

00:21:14.510 --> 00:21:14.520
that on the one hand yes and the other
 

00:21:14.520 --> 00:21:16.790
that on the one hand yes and the other
hand we also like to exert scientific

00:21:16.790 --> 00:21:16.800
hand we also like to exert scientific
 

00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:21.020
hand we also like to exert scientific
Authority so science I mean I I

00:21:21.020 --> 00:21:21.030
Authority so science I mean I I
 

00:21:21.030 --> 00:21:23.120
Authority so science I mean I I
mentioned in my talk that there's no

00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:23.130
mentioned in my talk that there's no
 

00:21:23.130 --> 00:21:25.060
mentioned in my talk that there's no
authority except nature yeah it's not

00:21:25.060 --> 00:21:25.070
authority except nature yeah it's not
 

00:21:25.070 --> 00:21:29.540
authority except nature yeah it's not
completely true since my fear you know

00:21:29.540 --> 00:21:29.550
completely true since my fear you know
 

00:21:29.550 --> 00:21:31.580
completely true since my fear you know
they're around this world of science

00:21:31.580 --> 00:21:31.590
they're around this world of science
 

00:21:31.590 --> 00:21:34.250
they're around this world of science
there's a vast world of pseudoscience

00:21:34.250 --> 00:21:34.260
there's a vast world of pseudoscience
 

00:21:34.260 --> 00:21:37.180
there's a vast world of pseudoscience
yes and we we have all sorts of

00:21:37.180 --> 00:21:37.190
yes and we we have all sorts of
 

00:21:37.190 --> 00:21:40.340
yes and we we have all sorts of
institutional protections that separate

00:21:40.340 --> 00:21:40.350
institutional protections that separate
 

00:21:40.350 --> 00:21:44.150
institutional protections that separate
science from pseudoscience and and they

00:21:44.150 --> 00:21:44.160
science from pseudoscience and and they
 

00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:46.190
science from pseudoscience and and they
work pretty well and do require a

00:21:46.190 --> 00:21:46.200
work pretty well and do require a
 

00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:48.500
work pretty well and do require a
certain amount of authority but its

00:21:48.500 --> 00:21:48.510
certain amount of authority but its
 

00:21:48.510 --> 00:21:50.270
certain amount of authority but its
authority that can always be questioned

00:21:50.270 --> 00:21:50.280
authority that can always be questioned
 

00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:53.420
authority that can always be questioned
and yes so so one thing that you know I

00:21:53.420 --> 00:21:53.430
and yes so so one thing that you know I
 

00:21:53.430 --> 00:21:55.760
and yes so so one thing that you know I
worry about is that you know we have

00:21:55.760 --> 00:21:55.770
worry about is that you know we have
 

00:21:55.770 --> 00:21:57.770
worry about is that you know we have
this enormous growth of the scientific

00:21:57.770 --> 00:21:57.780
this enormous growth of the scientific
 

00:21:57.780 --> 00:21:59.840
this enormous growth of the scientific
edit surface you know the architecture

00:21:59.840 --> 00:21:59.850
edit surface you know the architecture
 

00:21:59.850 --> 00:22:02.510
edit surface you know the architecture
we have really the number of scientists

00:22:02.510 --> 00:22:02.520
we have really the number of scientists
 

00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:04.730
we have really the number of scientists
is growing incredibly fast

00:22:04.730 --> 00:22:04.740
is growing incredibly fast
 

00:22:04.740 --> 00:22:06.649
is growing incredibly fast
the number of collaborations is growing

00:22:06.649 --> 00:22:06.659
the number of collaborations is growing
 

00:22:06.659 --> 00:22:08.899
the number of collaborations is growing
very fast there's a lot of policing

00:22:08.899 --> 00:22:08.909
very fast there's a lot of policing
 

00:22:08.909 --> 00:22:11.450
very fast there's a lot of policing
going on yes but you know little bit

00:22:11.450 --> 00:22:11.460
going on yes but you know little bit
 

00:22:11.460 --> 00:22:13.720
going on yes but you know little bit

infection at one place could easily
spread right isn't that something you

00:22:18.710 --> 00:22:18.720
spread right isn't that something you
 

00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:20.779
spread right isn't that something you
worry about that you know if there's

00:22:20.779 --> 00:22:20.789
worry about that you know if there's
 

00:22:20.789 --> 00:22:23.810
worry about that you know if there's
some major disaster in the scientific

00:22:23.810 --> 00:22:23.820
some major disaster in the scientific
 

00:22:23.820 --> 00:22:25.340
some major disaster in the scientific
world that people start doubting all

00:22:25.340 --> 00:22:25.350
world that people start doubting all
 

00:22:25.350 --> 00:22:30.669

science we have strong

00:22:30.669 --> 00:22:30.679
science we have strong
 

00:22:30.679 --> 00:22:34.009
science we have strong
we have strong a strong immunological

00:22:34.009 --> 00:22:34.019
we have strong a strong immunological

00:22:36.740 --> 00:22:39.859
system that we've collected so far
protects us from pseudoscience by and

00:22:39.859 --> 00:22:39.869
protects us from pseudoscience by and
 

00:22:39.869 --> 00:22:44.119
protects us from pseudoscience by and
large it's very decent idea I'm not sure

00:22:44.119 --> 00:22:44.129
large it's very decent idea I'm not sure
 

00:22:44.129 --> 00:22:47.619
large it's very decent idea I'm not sure
but yeah I suppose it could happen

00:22:47.619 --> 00:22:47.629
but yeah I suppose it could happen
 

00:22:47.629 --> 00:22:51.139
but yeah I suppose it could happen
progress if you look human history or

00:22:51.139 --> 00:22:51.149
progress if you look human history or
 

00:22:51.149 --> 00:22:52.820
progress if you look human history or

recent human history of the last ten
 

00:22:52.830 --> 00:22:55.039
recent human history of the last ten
thousand years definitely shows us that

00:22:55.039 --> 00:22:55.049
thousand years definitely shows us that
 

00:22:55.049 --> 00:22:59.060
thousand years definitely shows us that
progress is not always positive yes we

00:22:59.060 --> 00:22:59.070
progress is not always positive yes we
 

00:22:59.070 --> 00:23:00.590
progress is not always positive yes we
should remember that in the days of

00:23:00.590 --> 00:23:00.600
should remember that in the days of
 

00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:03.139
should remember that in the days of
Trump yeah there were there was this

00:23:03.139 --> 00:23:03.149
Trump yeah there were there was this
 

00:23:03.149 --> 00:23:04.999
Trump yeah there were there was this

00:23:04.999 --> 00:23:05.009
period from the end of the Roman Empire

yes where indeed we lost our

00:23:10.519 --> 00:23:10.529
yes where indeed we lost our
 

00:23:10.529 --> 00:23:13.489
yes where indeed we lost our
understanding of science of scientific

00:23:13.489 --> 00:23:13.499
understanding of science of scientific

00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:23.730
yes one thing you said I want just to
 

00:23:23.730 --> 00:23:25.369
yes one thing you said I want just to
finish we were getting to the end so you

00:23:25.369 --> 00:23:25.379
finish we were getting to the end so you
 

00:23:25.379 --> 00:23:29.029
finish we were getting to the end so you
you end it you're with a kind of a slide

00:23:29.029 --> 00:23:29.039
you end it you're with a kind of a slide
 

00:23:29.039 --> 00:23:32.239
you end it you're with a kind of a slide
that was saying we will be in the end so

00:23:32.239 --> 00:23:32.249
that was saying we will be in the end so
 

00:23:32.249 --> 00:23:35.720
that was saying we will be in the end so

I think you know that we have this kind

importantly we unlike the beginning of
 

00:23:52.980 --> 00:23:55.519
importantly we unlike the beginning of
the Middle Ages we have a single

language of science yes and luckily it's

00:23:58.549 --> 00:23:58.559
language of science yes and luckily it's
 

00:23:58.559 --> 00:24:00.150
language of science yes and luckily it's
not that

00:24:00.150 --> 00:24:00.160
not that
 

00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:04.380
not that
[Laughter]

00:24:04.380 --> 00:24:04.390
 

00:24:04.390 --> 00:24:06.850
actually in the 17th century there was

00:24:06.850 --> 00:24:06.860
actually in the 17th century there was
 

00:24:06.860 --> 00:24:09.340
actually in the 17th century there was
one Dutch scientist Athena thought that

00:24:09.340 --> 00:24:09.350
one Dutch scientist Athena thought that
 

00:24:09.350 --> 00:24:10.810
one Dutch scientist Athena thought that
actually Dutch was the language spoken

00:24:10.810 --> 00:24:10.820
actually Dutch was the language spoken
 

00:24:10.820 --> 00:24:12.940
actually Dutch was the language spoken
in paradise I will explain you in a

00:24:12.940 --> 00:24:12.950
in paradise I will explain you in a
 

00:24:12.950 --> 00:24:16.270
in paradise I will explain you in a

00:24:16.270 --> 00:24:16.280
moment why that's why he felt compelled
 

00:24:16.280 --> 00:24:18.790
moment why that's why he felt compelled
to have Dutch brought all the scientific

00:24:18.790 --> 00:24:18.800
to have Dutch brought all the scientific
 

00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:22.560
to have Dutch brought all the scientific

00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:22.570
inspired gods to pronounce it correct so
 

00:24:22.570 --> 00:24:25.780
inspired gods to pronounce it correct so
let's finally talk about this this

00:24:25.780 --> 00:24:25.790
let's finally talk about this this
 

00:24:25.790 --> 00:24:28.630
let's finally talk about this this
element that you know we we are an

00:24:28.630 --> 00:24:28.640
element that you know we we are an
 

00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:30.190
element that you know we we are an
international community and I think

00:24:30.190 --> 00:24:30.200
international community and I think
 

00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:33.220
international community and I think
that's something very very rare right

00:24:33.220 --> 00:24:33.230
that's something very very rare right
 

00:24:33.230 --> 00:24:34.750
that's something very very rare right
when I don't think we have any had

00:24:34.750 --> 00:24:34.760
when I don't think we have any had
 

00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:37.330
when I don't think we have any had
anything before where there is a culture

00:24:37.330 --> 00:24:37.340
anything before where there is a culture
 

00:24:37.340 --> 00:24:39.670
anything before where there is a culture
that's you know spread around I think it

00:24:39.670 --> 00:24:39.680
that's you know spread around I think it
 

00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:42.070
that's you know spread around I think it
has a universal language it might have

00:24:42.070 --> 00:24:42.080
has a universal language it might have
 

00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:43.540
has a universal language it might have
been English you might also argue it's

00:24:43.540 --> 00:24:43.550
been English you might also argue it's
 

00:24:43.550 --> 00:24:46.960
been English you might also argue it's
mathematics and that creates some kind

00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:46.970
mathematics and that creates some kind
 

00:24:46.970 --> 00:24:48.790
mathematics and that creates some kind
of stability our shared calls to a

00:24:48.790 --> 00:24:48.800
of stability our shared calls to a
 

00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:51.520
of stability our shared calls to a
shared language and you know I often

00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:51.530
shared language and you know I often
 

00:24:51.530 --> 00:24:54.940
shared language and you know I often
think if somebody were to ask me like
