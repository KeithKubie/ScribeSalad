00:00:00.778 --> 00:00:01.786
- [Voiceover] We've already seen scenarios

00:00:02.578 --> 00:00:04.273
where we start with a
differential equation

00:00:04.273 --> 00:00:06.258
and then we generate a slope field

00:00:06.258 --> 00:00:08.475
that describes the solutions
to the differential equation

00:00:08.475 --> 00:00:11.029
and then we use that to
visualize those solutions.

00:00:11.029 --> 00:00:13.072
What I want to do in this
video is do an exercise

00:00:13.072 --> 00:00:17.553
that takes us the other way,
start with a slope field

00:00:17.553 --> 00:00:19.829
and figure out which differential equation

00:00:19.829 --> 00:00:22.694
is the slope field
describing the solutions for.

00:00:23.137 --> 00:00:26.295
And so I encourage you to
look at each of these options

00:00:26.295 --> 00:00:29.418
and think about which of
these differential equations

00:00:29.418 --> 00:00:32.296
is being described by this slope field.

00:00:32.296 --> 00:00:33.304
I encourage you to pause
the video right now

00:00:34.096 --> 00:00:35.170
and try it on your own.

00:00:36.975 --> 00:00:40.132
So I'm assuming you have had a go at it.

00:00:40.132 --> 00:00:41.206
So let's work through each of them.

00:00:41.874 --> 00:00:44.289
And the way I'm going to do
it is I'm just going to find

00:00:44.289 --> 00:00:47.806
some points that seem to be
easy to do arithmetic with,

00:00:47.806 --> 00:00:51.533
and we'll see if the slope
described by the differential

00:00:51.533 --> 00:00:54.505
equation at that point is
consistent with the slope

00:00:54.505 --> 00:00:56.548
depicted in the slope field.

00:00:56.548 --> 00:00:57.551
And, I don't know, just for simplicity,

00:00:57.848 --> 00:00:58.851
maybe I'll do x equals one and

00:00:59.148 --> 00:01:01.029
y equals one for all of these.

00:01:01.029 --> 00:01:05.928
So, when x equals one
and y is equal to one.

00:01:05.928 --> 00:01:08.134
So, this first differential
equation right over here,

00:01:08.134 --> 00:01:11.188
if x is one and y is
one, then dy/dx would be

00:01:11.674 --> 00:01:14.426
negative one over one or negative one.

00:01:14.426 --> 00:01:17.495
Dy/dx would be negative one.

00:01:18.116 --> 00:01:19.623
Now, is that depicted here?

00:01:19.623 --> 00:01:22.308
When x is equal to one
and y is equal to one,

00:01:22.308 --> 00:01:24.419
our slope isn't negative one.

00:01:24.419 --> 00:01:26.798
Our slope here looks positive.

00:01:26.798 --> 00:01:29.502
So we can rule this one out.

00:01:29.782 --> 00:01:31.419
Now, let's try the next one.

00:01:31.419 --> 00:01:35.018
So, if x is equal to one
and y is equal to one,

00:01:35.018 --> 00:01:40.018
well then dy/dx would be equal
to one minus one or zero.

00:01:40.985 --> 00:01:44.084
And, once again, I just
picked x equals one

00:01:44.084 --> 00:01:45.826
and y equals one for convenience.

00:01:45.826 --> 00:01:46.754
I could have picked any other.

00:01:46.754 --> 00:01:49.065
I could have picked negative
five and negative seven.

00:01:49.065 --> 00:01:51.082
This just makes the
arithmetic a little easier.

00:01:51.235 --> 00:01:53.000
Once again, when you look at that point

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.161
that we've already looked at,

00:01:54.161 --> 00:01:55.682
our slope is clearly not zero.

00:01:55.682 --> 00:01:59.035
We have a positive slope
here, so we can rule that out.

00:01:59.234 --> 00:02:02.879
Once again, for this magenta
differential equation,

00:02:02.879 --> 00:02:05.514
if x and y are both equal to one,

00:02:05.514 --> 00:02:10.514
then one minus one is once
again going to be equal to zero.

00:02:11.423 --> 00:02:14.941
And we've already seen this
slope is not zero here,

00:02:14.941 --> 00:02:17.598
so rule that one out.

00:02:17.855 --> 00:02:19.794
And now here we have x plus y,

00:02:19.794 --> 00:02:22.278
so when x is one and y is one,

00:02:22.278 --> 00:02:25.296
our derivate of y with
respect to x is going to be

00:02:25.296 --> 00:02:29.371
one plus one, which is equal to two.

00:02:29.371 --> 00:02:31.054
Now, this looks interesting.

00:02:31.054 --> 00:02:33.933
It looks like this slope
right over here could be two.

00:02:33.933 --> 00:02:34.699
This looks like one.

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:36.220
This looks like two.

00:02:36.022 --> 00:02:37.439
I would want to validate
some other points,

00:02:37.637 --> 00:02:40.980
but this looks like a really,
really good candidate.

00:02:40.098 --> 00:02:42.873
And you can also see
what is happening here.

00:02:43.755 --> 00:02:46.018
When dy/dx is equal to x plus y,

00:02:46.018 --> 00:02:48.564
you would expect that as
x increases for a given y

00:02:48.564 --> 00:02:50.605
your slope would increase

00:02:50.605 --> 00:02:53.169
and as y increases for a
given x your slope increases.

00:02:53.169 --> 00:02:54.242
And we see that.

00:02:54.899 --> 00:02:57.973
If we were to just hold y constant at one

00:02:57.973 --> 00:03:00.907
but increase x along this line,

00:03:00.907 --> 00:03:02.974
we see that the slope is increasing.

00:03:02.974 --> 00:03:04.587
It is getting steeper.

00:03:04.587 --> 00:03:06.329
And if we were to keep x constant

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:08.465
and increase y across this line,

00:03:08.465 --> 00:03:10.531
we see that the slope increases.

00:03:10.531 --> 00:03:12.533
And, in general, we see
that the slope increases

00:03:12.551 --> 00:03:15.175
as we go to the top right.

00:03:15.175 --> 00:03:20.175
And we see that it decreases
as we go to the bottom left

00:03:20.271 --> 00:03:23.684
and both x and y become
much, much more negative.

00:03:23.684 --> 00:03:25.646
So, I'm feeling pretty good about this,

00:03:25.646 --> 00:03:28.188
especially if we can
knock this one out here,

00:03:28.188 --> 00:03:30.011
if we can knock that one out.

00:03:30.011 --> 00:03:32.553
So, dy/dx is equal to x over y.

00:03:32.553 --> 00:03:35.746
Well, then when x equals
one and y equals one,

00:03:35.746 --> 00:03:40.482
dy/dx would be equal to one,

00:03:40.482 --> 00:03:42.769
and this slope looks larger than one.

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:45.045
It looks like two, but since

00:03:45.045 --> 00:03:46.368
we are really just eyeballing it,

00:03:46.368 --> 00:03:47.703
let's see if we can find something

00:03:47.703 --> 00:03:51.604
where this more clearly falls apart.

00:03:51.604 --> 00:03:52.869
So, let's look at the situation

00:03:52.869 --> 00:03:56.503
when they both equal negative one.

00:03:56.503 --> 00:04:00.682
So, x equals negative one and
y is equal to negative one.

00:04:00.682 --> 00:04:04.466
Well, in that case, dy/dx
should still be equal to one

00:04:04.466 --> 00:04:06.544
because you have negative one over one.

00:04:06.544 --> 00:04:08.205
Do we see that over here?

00:04:08.205 --> 00:04:10.666
So, when x is equal to negative one,

00:04:10.666 --> 00:04:13.045
y is equal to negative one.

00:04:13.045 --> 00:04:16.608
Our derivative here looks negative.

00:04:16.608 --> 00:04:17.910
It looks like negative two,

00:04:17.091 --> 00:04:20.422
which is consistent with this
yellow differential equation.

00:04:21.241 --> 00:04:24.747
The slope here is definitely
not a positive one,

00:04:24.747 --> 00:04:28.323
so we could rule this one out as well.

00:04:28.323 --> 00:04:30.726
And so we should feel pretty confident

00:04:30.726 --> 00:04:34.267
that this is the differential
equation being described.

00:04:34.267 --> 00:04:36.520
And now that we've done it,
we can actually think about

00:04:36.052 --> 00:04:37.479
well, okay, what are the solutions

00:04:37.947 --> 00:04:39.688
for this differential
equation going to look like.

00:04:39.688 --> 00:04:42.080
Well, it depends where they start

00:04:42.008 --> 00:04:43.170
or what points they contain.

00:04:43.242 --> 00:04:45.841
If you have a solution
that contains that point,

00:04:45.841 --> 00:04:50.841
it looks like it might
do something like this.

00:04:57.241 --> 00:05:02.241
If you had a solution
that contained this point,

00:05:03.963 --> 00:05:08.963
it might do something like that.

00:05:11.684 --> 00:05:12.960
And, of course, it keeps going.

00:05:12.096 --> 00:05:13.733
It looks like it would asymptote towards

00:05:14.597 --> 00:05:19.136
y is equal to negative
x, this downward sloping.

00:05:19.136 --> 00:05:24.136
This essentially is the line
y is equal to negative x.

00:05:24.964 --> 00:05:27.518
Actually, no that is not the
line y equals negative x.

00:05:27.518 --> 00:05:31.674
This is the line y is equal
to negative x minus one,

00:05:31.674 --> 00:05:33.601
so that's this line right over here.

00:05:33.601 --> 00:05:38.601
And it looks like if
the solution contained,

00:05:41.715 --> 00:05:43.503
say, this point right over here,

00:05:43.503 --> 00:05:46.138
that would actually be a solution to

00:05:46.138 --> 00:05:51.138
the differential equation y is
equal to negative x minus one

00:05:55.298 --> 00:05:56.215
and you can verify that.

00:05:56.215 --> 00:06:00.499
If y is equal to negative x minus one,

00:06:00.499 --> 00:06:01.741
then the x and negative x cancel out

00:06:01.741 --> 00:06:04.156
and you are just left with
dy/dx is equal to negative one,

00:06:04.156 --> 00:06:05.351
which is exactly what is being

00:06:05.351 --> 00:06:07.058
described by this slope field.

00:06:07.058 --> 00:06:09.297
Anyway, hopefully you
found that interesting.
