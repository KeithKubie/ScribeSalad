00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.930
Scientists just mapped a huge part of our
universe and found out…

00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:10.750
Einstein is always right.

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:11.870
Hi there cosmic entities!

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:16.170
Ian here for DNews…. and prepare to have
your mind BLOWN.

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.369
Researchers have created an incredible 3-dimensional
map of a region of the universe.

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.779
As part of the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic
Survey, or BOSS, which is headed by the Sloan

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:27.590
Digital Sky Survey, they pinpointed a whopping
1.2 million galaxies covering a quarter of

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:29.679
the visible sky!

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:33.940
It’s a volume that is about 650 cubic billion
light years big.

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:37.730
Within that huge expanse, astronomers start
to see the large-scale structure of the cosmos

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:40.440
between two to seven billion light-years away.

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.730
In other words, they’re spying on the universe
as it was two to seven billion years AGO.

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.399
And it just so happens that this is an important
era to study if we are to understand the strange

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:49.510
effects of dark energy.

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:54.580
Now, dark energy makes up for 70% of ALL the
energy in the universe and has a bizarre anti-gravity

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:57.090
effect on space-time, causing it to expand.

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.829
And the expansion is accelerating.

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.950
So cosmologists REALLY want to know what dark
energy IS and how it’s going to shape the

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:04.480
evolution of the universe.

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:08.910
In an effort to get to grips with this mysterious
energy, astronomers need to think really big,

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:11.660
capturing the motion of a HUGE number of galaxies.

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:12.750
This is where BOSS comes in.

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.440
Now...things get a little more complicated.

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:16.660
So bear with me.

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:22.020
At the moment of the Big Bang, 13.82 billion
years ago, there was just energy.

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.450
As time went on, the universe expanded and
cooled and matter started to condense to form

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.510
the quarks, atoms, electrons and all that
other good stuff our universe contains.

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:35.360
During this early time, baryon acoustic oscillations,
or BAOs, rippled through the early universe.

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.220
You can imagine these BAOs as a bit like sound
waves traveling through a gas.

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:43.060
They created regions of dense matter and regions
empty of matter.

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:47.750
The BAOs started out small, but as the universe
expanded, they expanded with it and became

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:50.850
larger, leaving their fingerprint in the structure
of the universe.

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.590
As this happened, clusters of galaxies formed
inside the high density regions caused by

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:56.710
the BAOs.

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:00.860
The most incredible thing is that BOSS can
SEE the BAOs in the galaxies recorded in this

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:03.060
massive 3D map.

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.060
But what does this mean?

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:08.330
Well, in this new research published in the
Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.140
Society, astronomers have specifically looked
back into the time when it is theorized that

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:16.470
dark energy really took hold of universal
expansion, causing vast galactic clusters

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:17.810
to fly away from one another.

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:23.310
By studying those 1.2 million galaxies that
existed between 2 to 7 billion years ago,

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.060
and recording the distance between the dense
clusters, we can see how fast the universe

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.270
expanded under the force of dark energy.

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:33.420
And it appears the universe is expanding in
PRECISELY the way we THEORIZED, with dark

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.620
energy continually stretching spacetime while
the gravity of dark matter is trying to pull

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.120
it all back in again.

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.390
This gives us further evidence for the existence
of dark matter AND dark energy.

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:45.240
But do you want to know the best thing?

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:49.800
By studying the motions of so many galaxies
over such a huge volume, this research has

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:53.810
shown that general relativity holds true over
cosmological scales.

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:57.700
Yes, Einstein’s theory has been proven correct
again.

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:58.760
Shocker.

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.600
Want to know more about some of BOSS’s awesome
finds?

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:05.190
Watch my recent DNews video to find out more
about how its discoveries are challenging

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:26.940
our views of the cosmos

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.330
Does dark energy freak you out, just a little?
