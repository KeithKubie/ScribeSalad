[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:08.340
JOSHUA: I'm really excited
today to welcome Martin

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.034
Atkins to Talks at Google.

00:00:10.034 --> 00:00:10.950
He's an entrepreneur--

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:16.800
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.380
Martin is an entrepreneur and
educator, a musician, producer,

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:24.300
DJ, and the list goes on.

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.870
With a 35-year career that
spans genres, borders,

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:30.510
and industries, you
could say that Martin

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.750
is the definition of
entrepreneurial activity

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.010
in cultural arts endeavors.

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:38.850
So to call out a few things
from his massive list

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.590
of accomplishments,
he was a member

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.950
of Public Image Ltd, founded
the industrial supergroup

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.070
Pigface, contributed
to Nine Inch Nails,

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.370
for which he won a Grammy,
as well as Ministry.

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.340
He's the owner of Invisible
Records, Mattress Factory

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.760
Recording Studios, and he's
the author of Book Smart--

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.250
or, excuse me, "Band
Smart," "Tour Smart,"

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.830
and I think I probably left a
few other titles out as well.

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:04.170
He is also the father of four.

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.000
Martin is also the
music business chair

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.340
at the SAE Institute Chicago.

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:14.370
I think a few of you
guys are here today.

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:17.620
And he's here to talk about the
creative industry with advice

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:20.980
for artists, musicians,
and entrepreneurs alike.

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:25.570
He has all kinds of tried,
tested, and remixed ideas

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:27.430
that all add up to
make a difference

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:29.650
in a creative and
arts-focused career.

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:32.470
He'll share his perspective
around longevity, efficiency,

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:36.820
and having a mindset to plant
the seeds of your own future.

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:38.410
So for Googlers in
the audience, be

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:40.660
sure to think of your
questions during the Q&amp;A, which

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:42.260
we'll have up at the end.

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.310
So please join me in welcoming
to the Google stage, Martin

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:46.762
Atkins.

00:01:46.762 --> 00:01:49.192
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:52.667 --> 00:01:54.500
MARTIN ATKINS: Thanks
for that introduction.

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.310
That was kind of awesome.

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:57.710
You did miss out
one of my books,

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:58.820
"Welcome to the Music Business--

00:01:58.820 --> 00:01:59.510
You're Fucked."

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:02.406
I think you did miss that one.

00:02:02.406 --> 00:02:04.400
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:05.260
So yeah.

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.640
Started playing drums
when I was nine.

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.039
Joined my first
band when I was 11.

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:13.250
Started drinking Newcastle
brown ale and backing strippers

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:15.020
at the age of 12.

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:16.130
And it's just been--

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:20.930
speaking of longevity, it's just
been a long, slow, sad decline

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:26.110
from what, in retrospect, was
a career high at the age of 12.

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:30.770
This is just a little bit of me
from my time with Public Image

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:36.310
Ltd, between Johnny Rotten of
the Sex Pistols to the Suicide

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:38.314
Girls from "American Bandstand."

00:02:38.314 --> 00:02:38.980
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:40.396
- Hello, what's
your name, please?

00:02:40.396 --> 00:02:41.410
- Martin Atkins.

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:41.950
- Welcome.

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:44.743
- To MTV.

00:02:44.743 --> 00:02:46.510
From Nine Inch Nails to Pigface.

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:47.330
[END PLAYBACK]

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:48.540
MARTIN ATKINS: Yeah.

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.240
I just like seeing that.

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:54.070
Me spitting and hitting this--
ruining microphones and stuff.

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:55.210
Two of my books.

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:56.650
My third book.

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:58.532
I always forget to
do this at the end.

00:02:58.532 --> 00:02:59.490
So I want to do it now.

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:03.040
If you follow me on
Twitter, @marteeeen,

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:09.380
my hilarious '80s joke is four
E's, just like the old days.

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:13.280
Yeah, laughter over
here, from [INAUDIBLE]..

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:17.254
Students are sitting here
going, what's happening?

00:03:17.254 --> 00:03:19.420
If you follow me on Twitter,
you get a free download

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:21.280
of my second book.

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:24.190
So what I'm going to--

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:27.130
this seems a little
bit grandiose.

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:31.150
Little stuff, big stuff, and
huge stuff, which is all I

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:36.160
could think of how to
describe this stuff.

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.940
First, before we
get into that, I

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:41.530
wanted to thank-- because
we're here in Chicago,

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:45.970
I wanted to thank Chance the
Rapper for donating $1 million

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:49.020
to Chicago public schools.

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:53.980
[APPLAUSE]

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:56.560
But is anybody else
thinking about what not--

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:59.300
you can do 1.5?

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:03.574
And you know-- but without
going off on too many tangents

00:04:03.574 --> 00:04:04.990
before we get
started, do you have

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:09.640
any idea how many types of
Kit Kat there are in Japan?

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:11.110
It's absolutely bonkers.

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:13.720
Soy sauce, ginger ale--

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:15.730
I don't know what the
meeting was on that one--

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:20.720
red bean, pumpkin,
baked potato Kit Kat.

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:23.430
Yeah, and I'd love to say,
we're going to try them all.

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:25.150
Mark down on your cards which--

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:27.850
I don't have baked
potato Kit Kats.

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:31.455
I do have some Kit
Kats, if anybody wants,

00:04:31.455 --> 00:04:33.580
if I can throw
out some Kit Kats.

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:36.827
Now, if some-- pay attention.

00:04:36.827 --> 00:04:38.200
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:39.710
We're not having a Google law--

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:43.310
I was stabbed in the
eye with a Kit Kat!

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:45.130
These will come out--

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:45.830
I see you.

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:46.330
All right.

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:48.590
We'll get there.

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:50.530
Oh, there we go.

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:53.140
Well, and that's all
we have time for.

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:58.560
Does anybody want some Kit Kats
that doesn't have Kit Kats?

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:06.490
So should I just-- if
I pass this over there,

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:08.147
will it get past you lot?

00:05:08.147 --> 00:05:09.264
AUDIENCE: No.

00:05:09.264 --> 00:05:11.680
MARTIN ATKINS: You could take
a couple and pass it around.

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:13.090
That will work.

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:14.950
Honor system.

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:18.340
Also, while I'm not
on the subject yet,

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:22.180
I'm loving this book "Hit
Makers" by Derek Thompson.

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:24.280
I'm really, really loving it.

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:30.100
I think he's the senior
editor of "Vanity Fair"?

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:31.660
"The Atlantic."

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:32.960
It's just awesome.

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:38.650
And while I'm up here, I just
got Kevin Coval's 10th book,

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:41.940
which is slightly awesome too.

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:44.712
OK, enough of that.

00:05:44.712 --> 00:05:46.300
Are there any rock
stars here today?

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:56.830
Let's try that again, shall we?

00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:01.540
Hey, hey, Googlers!

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:04.312
Are there any rock
stars here today?

00:06:04.312 --> 00:06:06.670
[CHEERING]

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:07.240
Absolutely.

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:08.073
That's more like it.

00:06:08.073 --> 00:06:08.897
Hand in the air.

00:06:08.897 --> 00:06:09.730
Hand on your crotch.

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:11.130
Doesn't have to be your crotch.

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:12.730
Anybody's.

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:17.290
But that's good news, because
Jimmy John's sandwich shop

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:19.360
is looking for some rock stars.

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:22.810
I don't mean to completely
deflate your ambitions,

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:27.220
but everything just keeps
changing all the time,

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:31.180
except this slide, which is
in every presentation I've

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:35.560
given in the last, I
don't know, 10 years.

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:38.180
Stuff just keeps changing.

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:40.900
Periscope-- well, there was
Meerkat before Periscope,

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:42.550
and no sooner had
I gone like that,

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:44.500
I was at South by
Southwest two years ago,

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:46.780
to kind of go, oh, Meerkat,
this is interesting.

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:49.420
Oh, by the time my
fingers hit the keys,

00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:51.230
it didn't exist anymore.

00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:52.870
And Periscope comes along.

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:55.770
And Instagress was awesome.

00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:59.190
And now they changed the--

00:06:59.190 --> 00:06:59.950
yeah.

00:06:59.950 --> 00:07:02.740
I'm liking Ripl.

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:06.820
Ripl makes your still
images look like video.

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:08.000
It's kind of cool.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.980
And this is just
a catastrophe now.

00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:12.250
Turntable FM.

00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:15.980
Does Vine still exist, even?

00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:17.000
Wow.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:18.450
See?

00:07:18.450 --> 00:07:21.470
So good job I approached
it that way, because, yeah.

00:07:21.470 --> 00:07:22.640
MySpace.

00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:23.210
It's back!

00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:25.160
No, it isn't.

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:30.490
It was-- even when it was back,
it was like, no, it isn't.

00:07:30.490 --> 00:07:32.570
Hootsuite actually is awesome.

00:07:32.570 --> 00:07:36.860
Landr is software that masters
your music in a heartbeat.

00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:41.420
But as I said, it's just a mess.

00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:42.715
Instagress, yeah.

00:07:42.715 --> 00:07:43.340
Just loving it.

00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:45.380
Everything keeps changing.

00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:53.250
Dunkin' Donuts, making
chicken sandwiches.

00:07:53.250 --> 00:07:55.390
Burger King, donuts.

00:07:58.050 --> 00:07:59.680
The world's gone mad.

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:00.900
It's gone mad.

00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:03.510
I'm like, what is how--
this is not right.

00:08:03.510 --> 00:08:07.330
I drove past Kentucky Fried
Chicken down by the White Sox,

00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:12.290
and the sign outside stays,
stop on in for a cake.

00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:14.460
No!

00:08:14.460 --> 00:08:16.650
I'm not gonna!

00:08:16.650 --> 00:08:19.170
Vinyl is back from
near-extinction,

00:08:19.170 --> 00:08:22.380
just after I threw
all my vinyl away.

00:08:22.380 --> 00:08:23.730
I threw all the vinyl away.

00:08:23.730 --> 00:08:24.870
Cassettes are back.

00:08:24.870 --> 00:08:28.070
This was a Cassette
Store Day 2013.

00:08:28.070 --> 00:08:32.480
And Punk is a beer.

00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:32.980
Right?

00:08:32.980 --> 00:08:36.030
Like, I was in a band with
Johnny Rotten for five years.

00:08:36.030 --> 00:08:36.530
Right?

00:08:36.530 --> 00:08:38.520
I came up through
punk in London.

00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:39.490
And now it's a beer.

00:08:39.490 --> 00:08:42.650
I want to go to the factory
and see the production line.

00:08:42.650 --> 00:08:44.195
Kids with, like,
yellow mohawks--

00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:54.480
At least we still have anarchy.

00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:55.870
Don't we?

00:08:55.870 --> 00:08:57.870
Here at Google, we still
have anarchy, don't we?

00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:03.530
Sometimes I'll say
to my kids, hey kids,

00:09:03.530 --> 00:09:05.139
you feel like a spot
of anarchy today?

00:09:05.139 --> 00:09:05.930
They're like, yeah.

00:09:05.930 --> 00:09:06.980
I've got four boys.

00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:07.830
Yes, Dad.

00:09:07.830 --> 00:09:09.410
I'm like yeah.

00:09:09.410 --> 00:09:15.980
The revitalizing
shower gel from Axe.

00:09:15.980 --> 00:09:17.790
I don't remember what
anarchy smelled like,

00:09:17.790 --> 00:09:18.100
but it's not that.

00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:19.100
I tell you what.

00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:22.130
There is also Anarchy for Him.

00:09:22.130 --> 00:09:26.940
Have you smelled it?

00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:29.390
Yeah.

00:09:29.390 --> 00:09:30.620
It's terrible.

00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:33.610
It's really bad.

00:09:33.610 --> 00:09:35.144
You just got off
a plane, Darren.

00:09:35.144 --> 00:09:36.560
DARREN: Why is it just for me?

00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:38.060
MARTIN ATKINS: Well,
you're English.

00:09:38.060 --> 00:09:40.515
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:40.515 --> 00:09:47.890
But ladies, yeah.

00:09:47.890 --> 00:09:51.310
Anarchy for Her.

00:09:51.310 --> 00:09:53.330
It all just blew back.

00:09:55.847 --> 00:09:57.430
Now here's a tip
with Anarchy for Her.

00:09:57.430 --> 00:09:59.180
You don't just spray it.

00:09:59.180 --> 00:10:00.400
You spray and then--

00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:06.050
you want to try some, Chelsea?

00:10:06.050 --> 00:10:07.400
Eddie?

00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:10.830
It's one-- pick one.

00:10:10.830 --> 00:10:12.880
It's terrible.

00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:14.500
It's really-- it's really bad.

00:10:17.290 --> 00:10:18.160
Yeah.

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:22.180
It's just going to
be circulating now.

00:10:22.180 --> 00:10:24.570
Yeah, there's the
Anarchy workout.

00:10:24.570 --> 00:10:29.059
And this is [INAUDIBLE]
credit card.

00:10:29.059 --> 00:10:30.850
There's nothing you
can do with that credit

00:10:30.850 --> 00:10:33.400
card that makes it punk.

00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:36.690
You could, like, buy a bag of
drugs with that credit card.

00:10:36.690 --> 00:10:39.580
There's nothing you can
do with that card that

00:10:39.580 --> 00:10:42.520
will make it punk.

00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:44.420
[COUGHING]

00:10:44.420 --> 00:10:48.230
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:48.230 --> 00:10:49.990
OK, little stuff.

00:10:53.050 --> 00:10:54.690
Let's look at some little stuff.

00:10:54.690 --> 00:10:56.740
We'll move on to bigger stuff.

00:10:56.740 --> 00:10:58.800
And we'll get to the huge stuff.

00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:01.560
Well, maybe we'll spend so
much time on the little stuff--

00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:03.740
who knows what's
going to happen.

00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:06.620
Fear of selling.

00:11:06.620 --> 00:11:08.430
Get over it.

00:11:08.430 --> 00:11:10.320
You know, I pulled
up at a venue--

00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:11.284
we were in Florida.

00:11:11.284 --> 00:11:13.200
And I said to my friend
[? Curtis Mackey, ?] I

00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:16.410
was doing a talk,
I'm like, should I

00:11:16.410 --> 00:11:19.240
bring my merch in tonight?

00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:21.510
Do you think it will sell?

00:11:21.510 --> 00:11:24.510
And he said, really
smartly, well, you

00:11:24.510 --> 00:11:28.500
won't sell any if you
leave it in the car.

00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:32.730
And I'm like, oh my god,
I'm protecting myself

00:11:32.730 --> 00:11:37.530
from putting my wares on
display, which sounds--

00:11:37.530 --> 00:11:40.650
selling my stuff.

00:11:40.650 --> 00:11:43.490
I'm frightened to sell my shit.

00:11:43.490 --> 00:11:45.050
And we all do that.

00:11:45.050 --> 00:11:48.770
You've got to get your stuff
out of the car and set it up.

00:11:48.770 --> 00:11:51.670
And it's not about
the selling of it,

00:11:51.670 --> 00:11:55.160
although it is if you need gas
money to get to the next gig.

00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:58.040
It's about the transaction,
which is never about money.

00:11:58.040 --> 00:12:02.870
It's a transaction
about relationship.

00:12:02.870 --> 00:12:04.130
Rolling your T-shirts.

00:12:04.130 --> 00:12:06.410
This is band-related stuff.

00:12:06.410 --> 00:12:07.730
You roll your shirts.

00:12:07.730 --> 00:12:08.480
Tip jar.

00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:11.270
I keep forgetting this
tiny little thing too.

00:12:11.270 --> 00:12:13.250
Have a tip jar.

00:12:13.250 --> 00:12:14.690
I got an email from a band.

00:12:14.690 --> 00:12:22.060
They said, that tip, the tip jar
tip, as it shall become known,

00:12:22.060 --> 00:12:24.640
saved our band.

00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:26.750
I'm like, what do you mean?

00:12:26.750 --> 00:12:28.490
Like, well, it didn't.

00:12:28.490 --> 00:12:30.280
But it kind of nearly did.

00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:33.430
After our first show, we
had a bit of an argument,

00:12:33.430 --> 00:12:35.710
and there was $15
in the tip jar.

00:12:35.710 --> 00:12:37.870
And we took that and
we went to Denny's.

00:12:37.870 --> 00:12:39.400
And we got, like, a band meal.

00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:42.460
And it felt like they'd
been bought dinner

00:12:42.460 --> 00:12:45.580
by some fictitious
record label or whatever.

00:12:45.580 --> 00:12:48.450
Good luck getting $15
out of a record label.

00:12:48.450 --> 00:12:51.130
But-- and over
dinner, they talked

00:12:51.130 --> 00:12:53.030
about what was
right about the day

00:12:53.030 --> 00:12:54.790
and what was wrong
about the day.

00:12:54.790 --> 00:12:56.706
And it didn't save their
band, but it got them

00:12:56.706 --> 00:12:57.550
to the next show.

00:12:57.550 --> 00:13:00.580
And the $15 from the next
tip jar got them to the show

00:13:00.580 --> 00:13:01.450
after that.

00:13:01.450 --> 00:13:04.300
Just tiny stuff that
made a big difference.

00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:06.940
You have to have
it say something

00:13:06.940 --> 00:13:09.070
smart on your tip jar.

00:13:09.070 --> 00:13:11.320
"Sexy people tip."

00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:13.350
"Every time you tip,
God saves a kitten."

00:13:13.350 --> 00:13:15.520
Of course that
needs to be changed.

00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:19.470
"Every time you tip,
we'll guillotine a kitten"

00:13:19.470 --> 00:13:20.620
at the back.

00:13:20.620 --> 00:13:26.337
In my genre, that's how
you really make the--

00:13:26.337 --> 00:13:28.045
and of course, you
need to have ambition.

00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:33.760
Have more than one T-shirt.

00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:35.230
Have a choice of shirts.

00:13:35.230 --> 00:13:40.220
Your question cannot be,
would you like to buy a shirt?

00:13:43.660 --> 00:13:47.860
Your question has to
be, blocking the exit,

00:13:47.860 --> 00:13:50.350
which one of these shirts
are you going to buy now?

00:13:50.350 --> 00:13:52.380
This one, or that one?

00:13:52.380 --> 00:13:55.760
It's a very different question.

00:13:55.760 --> 00:13:59.480
Give away your
songs all the time.

00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:01.610
Give away everything
all the time.

00:14:01.610 --> 00:14:05.610
And some musicians
still are like, yeah,

00:14:05.610 --> 00:14:07.460
we'll give away
that demo or that

00:14:07.460 --> 00:14:09.910
crappy live recording we did.

00:14:09.910 --> 00:14:13.410
Or that mix that didn't work
out very well that was cheap.

00:14:13.410 --> 00:14:14.440
Let's give that away.

00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:15.230
You can't.

00:14:15.230 --> 00:14:18.050
You have to give away your
best stuff all the time.

00:14:18.050 --> 00:14:21.050
You have got this one chance
to start a relationship.

00:14:21.050 --> 00:14:28.710
If you were a bakery, you've
got some smoked salmon things--

00:14:28.710 --> 00:14:30.760
I've watching "The
Great British Baking

00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:35.350
Show," so I'm about to go off
at some flaky vol-au-vent pastry

00:14:35.350 --> 00:14:37.060
nightmare.

00:14:37.060 --> 00:14:37.960
I'm honest-- yeah.

00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:38.880
Great-- yeah.

00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:39.850
You've got to watch it.

00:14:39.850 --> 00:14:42.280
"Great British
Baking Show," very--

00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:44.560
well, "Great British
Baking Show" and heroine,

00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:45.310
really relaxing.

00:14:48.190 --> 00:14:49.690
So you're at this
bakery, and you've

00:14:49.690 --> 00:14:51.100
got this smoked
salmon vol-au-vent

00:14:51.100 --> 00:14:52.391
thing that costs you a fortune.

00:14:52.391 --> 00:14:55.000
It's complicated and
difficult to make.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.070
You don't want to
give that away.

00:14:57.070 --> 00:15:00.010
You've also got some stale
bagel chips that didn't turn out

00:15:00.010 --> 00:15:04.327
very well, and somebody tripped,
dropped them on the floor,

00:15:04.327 --> 00:15:06.910
and now you've got stale bagel
chips that people didn't really

00:15:06.910 --> 00:15:08.510
like, and there's
probably some cat

00:15:08.510 --> 00:15:11.350
hair mixed in with them too.

00:15:11.350 --> 00:15:13.610
You can't give them away.

00:15:13.610 --> 00:15:15.280
That's the end of
your relationship,

00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:18.880
with your free stale
cat-hair-infested bagel chips.

00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:21.090
You've got to give
away the smoked salmon

00:15:21.090 --> 00:15:22.390
vol-au-vent thing.

00:15:22.390 --> 00:15:23.670
And there's a relationship.

00:15:26.390 --> 00:15:26.930
I'm hungry.

00:15:26.930 --> 00:15:30.420
Anybody else hungry now?

00:15:30.420 --> 00:15:33.390
It's time to remove
the protective cup.

00:15:33.390 --> 00:15:35.490
So come on, everybody.

00:15:35.490 --> 00:15:38.260
This is left over from
my sports lecture.

00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:43.374
So '80s business, '90s
business, was this, wasn't it?

00:15:43.374 --> 00:15:44.790
Everybody's
protecting their shit.

00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:51.430
That can't be how
we act anymore.

00:15:51.430 --> 00:15:55.230
You've got to put your
arms down to the side

00:15:55.230 --> 00:15:56.890
and give people a hammer.

00:16:00.670 --> 00:16:02.410
Here's the thing.

00:16:02.410 --> 00:16:05.740
The bigger the hammer you give
to somebody, the less likely

00:16:05.740 --> 00:16:10.150
they are to smash you
in the crotch with it.

00:16:10.150 --> 00:16:10.840
Right?

00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:13.782
If you do that, if you
put arms to the side,

00:16:13.782 --> 00:16:14.740
you want to hammer my--

00:16:14.740 --> 00:16:17.820
and you give me some GI
Joe toy miniature hammer,

00:16:17.820 --> 00:16:18.650
I'll find a way--

00:16:18.650 --> 00:16:21.700
I'll kill you with it.

00:16:21.700 --> 00:16:24.190
If you give me a sledgehammer,
I'll be like, oh, yeah,

00:16:24.190 --> 00:16:24.760
here we go.

00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:26.040
Bring it on.

00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:29.410
One, two-- I can't, mate.

00:16:29.410 --> 00:16:32.020
Let's go have a beer.

00:16:32.020 --> 00:16:35.710
The bigger the hammer you
give, the less likely people

00:16:35.710 --> 00:16:40.620
are to smash you in
the crotch with it.

00:16:40.620 --> 00:16:42.320
I don't just talk
about this stuff.

00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:44.770
This is my version
of the hammer.

00:16:44.770 --> 00:16:47.710
I did a thing on my
website Christmas Eve.

00:16:47.710 --> 00:16:49.960
Hey, things are going
pretty good for me.

00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:54.930
If they're not going very
well for you, pick a discount.

00:16:54.930 --> 00:16:59.170
Emboldened by my
sledgehammer slide,

00:16:59.170 --> 00:17:02.810
and I put those discounts up.

00:17:02.810 --> 00:17:05.420
It felt like punk rock to me.

00:17:05.420 --> 00:17:05.960
Right?

00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:08.390
30%, 50%, 90%.

00:17:08.390 --> 00:17:11.599
Do you know the discount
that I didn't imagine people

00:17:11.599 --> 00:17:14.990
would use that they used a lot?

00:17:14.990 --> 00:17:16.349
Zero!

00:17:16.349 --> 00:17:17.750
I'm like, holy crap!

00:17:17.750 --> 00:17:20.690
Why would somebody use 0% when
they've got a choice of 30%,

00:17:20.690 --> 00:17:21.750
50%, 90%?

00:17:21.750 --> 00:17:23.690
I don't know, but
lots of people did.

00:17:23.690 --> 00:17:27.530
Because I gave a big
sledgehammer, 90%.

00:17:27.530 --> 00:17:29.180
Next time I do this--
and I got busy,

00:17:29.180 --> 00:17:30.429
but I'm going to do it again--

00:17:30.429 --> 00:17:32.030
I think I'll do 100%.

00:17:32.030 --> 00:17:35.120
Now, I'm not just going to do
100% and then go on holiday.

00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:38.767
I'm going to do 100% and
sit by the laptop going, oh!

00:17:38.767 --> 00:17:39.267
Oh!

00:17:39.267 --> 00:17:40.550
Oh!

00:17:40.550 --> 00:17:41.910
Get ready to shut that down.

00:17:41.910 --> 00:17:46.805
Oh, temporary-- oh,
the servers crashed.

00:17:46.805 --> 00:17:48.570
Right, be smart about it.

00:17:48.570 --> 00:17:53.870
But it's trust
that we're selling.

00:17:53.870 --> 00:17:55.700
That's not right, is it?

00:17:55.700 --> 00:17:58.010
It's trust that we're building.

00:17:58.010 --> 00:17:59.930
It's trust that we're making.

00:17:59.930 --> 00:18:04.610
It's trust that we choose
to create this obstacle

00:18:04.610 --> 00:18:05.520
course for, in a way.

00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:09.100
Yeah.

00:18:09.100 --> 00:18:12.970
There's no real
reason for this slide.

00:18:12.970 --> 00:18:16.070
There's a quote from Chuck
D. So I could see, I'm like,

00:18:16.070 --> 00:18:18.790
yeah, so what Chuck D. says,
"What you know is what you save

00:18:18.790 --> 00:18:20.740
and what you save
is what you make."

00:18:20.740 --> 00:18:22.810
But really, it's
just me and Chuck D.

00:18:22.810 --> 00:18:29.100
I was hanging out with
Chuck D. There you go.

00:18:29.100 --> 00:18:31.330
There's no more of
that in this lecture.

00:18:31.330 --> 00:18:34.600
It's just me and you
and Sir Richard Branson.

00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:39.520
Anyway-- what an asshole.

00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:41.110
Protect your assets.

00:18:41.110 --> 00:18:42.850
You need assets.

00:18:42.850 --> 00:18:44.770
Always have something
else to sell.

00:18:44.770 --> 00:18:45.280
Right?

00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:47.320
All this free stuff is
great, but if you only

00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:49.510
have one shirt, one
song, one thing,

00:18:49.510 --> 00:18:51.340
you're screwed when
you give it away.

00:18:51.340 --> 00:18:54.145
You need 10 more things,
and other things besides.

00:18:54.145 --> 00:18:55.770
So when you give
something away, you're

00:18:55.770 --> 00:18:58.120
stimulating and
creating this other part

00:18:58.120 --> 00:19:01.060
of this relationship.

00:19:01.060 --> 00:19:01.660
Bigger stuff.

00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:07.290
You want to spread your
message far and wide.

00:19:07.290 --> 00:19:09.150
We start to think
geographically.

00:19:09.150 --> 00:19:10.410
We start to look at a map.

00:19:10.410 --> 00:19:11.451
Where are we going to go?

00:19:11.451 --> 00:19:12.010
No.

00:19:12.010 --> 00:19:13.660
Install a jacuzzi.

00:19:13.660 --> 00:19:15.630
Go to culinary school.

00:19:15.630 --> 00:19:17.540
Start brewing amazing beer.

00:19:17.540 --> 00:19:19.650
Thanks, Lance, that's
one of my favorite beers

00:19:19.650 --> 00:19:21.500
in the world, that is.

00:19:21.500 --> 00:19:23.010
Buy some extra beds.

00:19:23.010 --> 00:19:25.320
These are the reasons things
will be better two years

00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:25.890
from now.

00:19:25.890 --> 00:19:28.980
I met this woman
in Cleveland, and I

00:19:28.980 --> 00:19:32.400
don't know if she was at a talk
somewhere, at one of my talks.

00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:36.270
And she said, well, at least
I know, wherever my son goes,

00:19:36.270 --> 00:19:38.450
he'll have people helping
him and protecting him.

00:19:38.450 --> 00:19:40.810
I go, how do you know that?

00:19:40.810 --> 00:19:44.390
And she shows me this book,
this tattered book, you know,

00:19:44.390 --> 00:19:48.170
one of those lined books
with the pen stuffed in it.

00:19:48.170 --> 00:19:49.644
And she did all of those things.

00:19:49.644 --> 00:19:50.810
She went to culinary school.

00:19:50.810 --> 00:19:52.268
They put a laundry
in the basement.

00:19:52.268 --> 00:19:56.270
Four beds, screaming internet,
and invited every band coming

00:19:56.270 --> 00:19:58.224
through town to stay with them.

00:19:58.224 --> 00:19:59.390
And she made them breakfast.

00:19:59.390 --> 00:20:01.040
She helped them
with the laundry.

00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:04.010
Right, she did all
of that cool stuff,

00:20:04.010 --> 00:20:08.160
and created connections for her
son, a safety net for her son.

00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:09.860
I'm like, that's genius.

00:20:09.860 --> 00:20:13.024
So we think of, how can
we be huge in Cleveland?

00:20:13.024 --> 00:20:15.440
Stay where you are and invite
bands from Cleveland to come

00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:17.270
stay with you, and then
go and stay with them.

00:20:17.270 --> 00:20:18.853
Of course, some of
them will break up.

00:20:18.853 --> 00:20:21.566
Some of them won't answer
the phone when you call.

00:20:21.566 --> 00:20:22.940
That's just the
roll of the dice.

00:20:22.940 --> 00:20:25.190
That's on them.

00:20:25.190 --> 00:20:28.730
Don't just do more, be more!

00:20:28.730 --> 00:20:29.762
Right?

00:20:29.762 --> 00:20:34.610
I got a nice piece
on NPR about this.

00:20:34.610 --> 00:20:36.620
I don't have time to
talk you through it.

00:20:36.620 --> 00:20:39.440
My blackberry jam scam story.

00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:42.860
But if you go to NPR,
"All Songs Considered,"

00:20:42.860 --> 00:20:44.780
there's a few nice
stories, actually.

00:20:44.780 --> 00:20:47.540
Me planting trees for
Bon Jovi's drummer.

00:20:47.540 --> 00:20:50.420
High point for me.

00:20:50.420 --> 00:20:52.000
What did you do
with your summer?

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:55.510
I was planting trees
for Bon Jovi's drummer.

00:20:55.510 --> 00:20:58.990
You've got to stay on top
of the newest technology.

00:20:58.990 --> 00:20:59.990
It's like ironic, right?

00:20:59.990 --> 00:21:01.900
I'm standing here at Google.

00:21:01.900 --> 00:21:06.226
You've got to stay on top of
all the newest shit, because--

00:21:06.226 --> 00:21:09.690
[PHONE RINGING] Really?

00:21:09.690 --> 00:21:11.420
Was there a sign?

00:21:11.420 --> 00:21:12.090
Is that me?

00:21:12.090 --> 00:21:12.890
Oh, it's me.

00:21:12.890 --> 00:21:14.020
Sorry.

00:21:14.020 --> 00:21:16.290
That is me.

00:21:16.290 --> 00:21:16.790
Yeah?

00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:23.580
Well, I'm doing a Google talk.

00:21:23.580 --> 00:21:25.060
Yeah.

00:21:25.060 --> 00:21:27.380
No, it's a hilarious--
yeah, it's a phone-- yeah.

00:21:30.110 --> 00:21:32.160
But you do.

00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:35.320
I'm joking about it, but
you know it's important.

00:21:35.320 --> 00:21:37.920
Technology,
technology, technology.

00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:39.246
AOL VOICE: You've got mail.

00:21:39.246 --> 00:21:40.140
MARTIN ATKINS: What?

00:21:40.140 --> 00:21:42.925
AOL VOICE: You've got mail.

00:21:42.925 --> 00:21:43.800
MARTIN ATKINS: Right.

00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:45.640
You're laughing.

00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:47.230
It's 9.0.

00:21:47.230 --> 00:21:51.922
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:51.922 --> 00:21:53.800
I've got AOL on my laptop.

00:21:53.800 --> 00:21:55.360
One of my favorite
things to do when

00:21:55.360 --> 00:21:58.170
I'm in the green room at
some conference, I'm like--

00:21:58.170 --> 00:22:01.050
doot doot doot-- I make
sure my volume's on full,

00:22:01.050 --> 00:22:02.907
make sure there's a
bunch of people sitting

00:22:02.907 --> 00:22:04.990
in the green room talking
about their new startup,

00:22:04.990 --> 00:22:07.860
and oh, we'll bootstrap
this and blah dee blah.

00:22:07.860 --> 00:22:09.250
And I'll hit that.

00:22:09.250 --> 00:22:10.750
And it's like,
honestly, I'm going

00:22:10.750 --> 00:22:13.480
to have to start traveling
with an ambulance or something,

00:22:13.480 --> 00:22:17.720
because the whiplash when people
hear that, it's just fantastic.

00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:22.040
And I don't kind of get
up and go, ha, ha, ha!

00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:24.185
I have to sit there and
pretend like I'm an idiot.

00:22:27.070 --> 00:22:28.205
But they're the idiots.

00:22:30.820 --> 00:22:32.570
Well, we got a little
bit off track there,

00:22:32.570 --> 00:22:34.010
but let's get back to--

00:22:34.010 --> 00:22:36.552
do something differ-net.

00:22:36.552 --> 00:22:38.200
Defer-nit.

00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:40.680
Do something different.

00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:42.650
Do more of what works
and less of what doesn't.

00:22:42.650 --> 00:22:44.983
That's the great thing about
all the apps and technology

00:22:44.983 --> 00:22:47.910
these-- you can track
something immediately.

00:22:47.910 --> 00:22:49.160
This is a great idea.

00:22:49.160 --> 00:22:50.780
No, it isn't.

00:22:50.780 --> 00:22:51.580
Change.

00:22:51.580 --> 00:22:52.610
Iterate.

00:22:52.610 --> 00:22:55.220
Do something else.

00:22:55.220 --> 00:22:56.260
Efficiency.

00:22:56.260 --> 00:22:58.380
I get pulled into
this all the time.

00:22:58.380 --> 00:23:00.450
People want to do
things more efficiently.

00:23:00.450 --> 00:23:02.030
There's no such
thing as efficiency.

00:23:02.030 --> 00:23:04.730
We just did a Pigface
show last year,

00:23:04.730 --> 00:23:06.740
and people bought
tickets from me.

00:23:06.740 --> 00:23:13.070
And they got a pair of
T-shirts and some coupons

00:23:13.070 --> 00:23:14.160
and some other stuff.

00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:16.940
And so I'm sending out all
these packages to people.

00:23:16.940 --> 00:23:18.440
I have a list of
all these addresses

00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:21.140
of people who wanted to come
and see my band Pigface.

00:23:21.140 --> 00:23:25.110
I'm like, well, I've
got to write a note,

00:23:25.110 --> 00:23:28.560
and I have to put their name
on it, and I have to sign it,

00:23:28.560 --> 00:23:31.520
which makes perfect sense if
you're talking to your grandma.

00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:34.560
Right, there's 450
packages going out.

00:23:34.560 --> 00:23:36.350
That's not nothing.

00:23:36.350 --> 00:23:39.840
Then I put in a signed
CD, which is not nothing,

00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:43.205
to unwrap a bunch of CDs, to
sign and then let them dry,

00:23:43.205 --> 00:23:44.080
and then put them in.

00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:46.590
Then I put handfuls of
candy in these envelopes,

00:23:46.590 --> 00:23:51.230
because we're building or
cementing or reinvigorating

00:23:51.230 --> 00:23:52.960
these relationships.

00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:56.920
So efficiency is just not in it.

00:23:56.920 --> 00:24:00.250
There needs to be a column
on the spreadsheet for vibe,

00:24:00.250 --> 00:24:05.440
grooviness, and something
else I can't think of.

00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:06.240
Right?

00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:09.700
But that should be
on a spreadsheet.

00:24:09.700 --> 00:24:12.970
We'll talk about longevity
in a bit, but yeah.

00:24:16.270 --> 00:24:17.910
No reason.

00:24:17.910 --> 00:24:19.250
No reason.

00:24:19.250 --> 00:24:21.360
I just like that slide.

00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:24.946
Sometimes it feels
like he's pointing--

00:24:24.946 --> 00:24:26.320
get the fuck over
whatever it is.

00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:27.920
It's something.

00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:30.140
Just get over it.

00:24:30.140 --> 00:24:32.220
Technical ability.

00:24:32.220 --> 00:24:36.530
This is worth mentioning.

00:24:36.530 --> 00:24:42.660
I think many of us want to
be really good at one thing.

00:24:42.660 --> 00:24:44.482
Doesn't matter.

00:24:44.482 --> 00:24:45.940
I was hanging out
with Jon Langford

00:24:45.940 --> 00:24:50.660
from The Mekons Tuesday night.

00:24:50.660 --> 00:24:52.476
And he said, he
started The Mekons--

00:24:52.476 --> 00:24:53.850
he played drums
in The Mekons not

00:24:53.850 --> 00:24:55.710
because he was a good drummer.

00:24:55.710 --> 00:24:57.570
He had a drum kit.

00:24:57.570 --> 00:24:58.737
That was it.

00:24:58.737 --> 00:25:00.695
And one of the guys, the
other guys in the band

00:25:00.695 --> 00:25:01.720
said, you want to start a band?

00:25:01.720 --> 00:25:02.803
Well, none of us can play.

00:25:02.803 --> 00:25:03.909
Should we start a band?

00:25:03.909 --> 00:25:04.450
And they did.

00:25:04.450 --> 00:25:08.690
They're celebrating their
40th anniversary this year.

00:25:08.690 --> 00:25:11.090
Here's a nine-year-old
prodigy guitarist

00:25:11.090 --> 00:25:14.750
on the "Ellen DeGeneres
Show" about to meet Ozzy.

00:25:14.750 --> 00:25:19.280
Here's a seven-year-old
drummer with 13 million hits.

00:25:19.280 --> 00:25:24.030
Whatever it is you're good
at, type in to YouTube,

00:25:24.030 --> 00:25:26.375
whatever you're good
at, "child prodigy."

00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:34.280
Within three minutes,
you'll be down uBreakiFix

00:25:34.280 --> 00:25:36.950
because you cried
into your laptop

00:25:36.950 --> 00:25:40.205
and the salty tears
sparked your keyboard.

00:25:43.130 --> 00:25:46.280
There might be one or two people
sitting there going, yeah,

00:25:46.280 --> 00:25:48.760
this doesn't apply to me.

00:25:48.760 --> 00:25:51.095
I'm a pilot.

00:25:51.095 --> 00:25:54.170
Yeah, so is this
five-year-old kid from China.

00:26:03.020 --> 00:26:05.220
Always say yes to everything.

00:26:05.220 --> 00:26:06.060
Difficult for me.

00:26:06.060 --> 00:26:07.620
I'm kind of shy.

00:26:07.620 --> 00:26:15.330
And there's like-- so I'm
revealing this part of me.

00:26:15.330 --> 00:26:18.010
You want to laugh?

00:26:18.010 --> 00:26:19.230
Go ahead and laugh.

00:26:19.230 --> 00:26:24.870
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:24.870 --> 00:26:28.660
There's, like, a three-year
lag between one of my slides

00:26:28.660 --> 00:26:31.220
and me actually doing
something about it.

00:26:31.220 --> 00:26:32.320
I've just realized.

00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:34.200
Right?

00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:37.060
But I was at South
by Southwest EDU,

00:26:37.060 --> 00:26:39.580
and I met the mayor
of Austin, who's

00:26:39.580 --> 00:26:42.910
doing some amazing shit
right now for sure.

00:26:42.910 --> 00:26:45.940
And it was this long day.

00:26:45.940 --> 00:26:48.180
And just about to
get in the elevator,

00:26:48.180 --> 00:26:52.780
and these Canadian educators
say, hey, let's go for sushi!

00:26:52.780 --> 00:26:56.160
I'm like, I felt
myself going, eh, ah.

00:26:56.160 --> 00:26:59.180
And I got like to, well, it's
been a long day, blah, blah,

00:26:59.180 --> 00:27:00.040
blah.

00:27:00.040 --> 00:27:01.320
You know.

00:27:01.320 --> 00:27:05.320
And I'm like, remember your
slides from the last four

00:27:05.320 --> 00:27:06.440
years, Martin!

00:27:06.440 --> 00:27:08.560
And I'm like, yes!

00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:10.510
Had the most
amazing time talking

00:27:10.510 --> 00:27:11.970
about education in Canada.

00:27:11.970 --> 00:27:14.770
It's very different
in Canada, obviously.

00:27:14.770 --> 00:27:16.800
So I use this.

00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:18.600
The guy who kind
of taught me that

00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:22.270
was either Bjornson from
Enslaved, long story.

00:27:22.270 --> 00:27:26.290
But it's kind of amazing.

00:27:26.290 --> 00:27:27.600
Let's try, can we?

00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:30.100
Let's have a pact between
ourselves here today

00:27:30.100 --> 00:27:34.080
to be more awesome than
a pasta restaurant.

00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:35.760
Can we do that?

00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:39.360
Does everybody agree to be
more awesome than a pasta

00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:41.370
restaurant?

00:27:41.370 --> 00:27:45.850
Because yeah, a few
of you are thinking,

00:27:45.850 --> 00:27:47.360
well, I thought
you said, past a--

00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:49.770
I should have said pasta
restaurant, shouldn't I?

00:27:49.770 --> 00:27:53.550
Pasta, restaurant.

00:27:53.550 --> 00:27:57.080
But they had this thing,
I think a year ago,

00:27:57.080 --> 00:28:00.250
where, hey, you want to come
in and eat some of our pasta?

00:28:00.250 --> 00:28:02.850
We'll watch your
kids for two hours.

00:28:02.850 --> 00:28:04.370
I'm like, wow!

00:28:04.370 --> 00:28:07.370
So originally, I put
this slide in my talk

00:28:07.370 --> 00:28:08.810
because it was like, wow.

00:28:08.810 --> 00:28:10.640
And then I started to get upset.

00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:14.360
Like, I'm pointing at a
pasta restaurant for us

00:28:14.360 --> 00:28:16.410
to, like, aspire to?

00:28:16.410 --> 00:28:16.910
You know?

00:28:16.910 --> 00:28:23.690
And then I start to see bands
on Facebook, well, Ohio,

00:28:23.690 --> 00:28:25.250
where were you Friday?

00:28:25.250 --> 00:28:26.210
Where was everybody?

00:28:26.210 --> 00:28:27.110
Where was our scene?

00:28:27.110 --> 00:28:28.340
What's going on?

00:28:28.340 --> 00:28:33.380
Just having a go at people
who didn't come to their show.

00:28:33.380 --> 00:28:35.160
Nobody cares.

00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:37.130
Nobody cares about
anything that's

00:28:37.130 --> 00:28:39.290
important to you for a moment.

00:28:39.290 --> 00:28:40.010
I'm in a band.

00:28:40.010 --> 00:28:41.120
Yeah.

00:28:41.120 --> 00:28:42.020
I'm a DJ.

00:28:42.020 --> 00:28:43.427
Oh, I'm a terrible DJ.

00:28:43.427 --> 00:28:44.760
You didn't mention that, Joshua.

00:28:44.760 --> 00:28:45.950
I'm really bad.

00:28:45.950 --> 00:28:47.690
I could destroy your wedding.

00:28:47.690 --> 00:28:49.010
Not in a good way.

00:28:49.010 --> 00:28:52.010
I could just completely
destroy your wedding.

00:28:52.010 --> 00:29:00.560
But I thought, how many artists
would watch their fans' kids?

00:29:00.560 --> 00:29:01.700
Right?

00:29:01.700 --> 00:29:03.890
So let's aspire to do that.

00:29:03.890 --> 00:29:05.990
Let's stop being shit.

00:29:05.990 --> 00:29:08.120
Start being awesome.

00:29:08.120 --> 00:29:09.650
Your brand is a
band and you want

00:29:09.650 --> 00:29:12.830
to have your customers be fans.

00:29:12.830 --> 00:29:14.210
So do your fans' laundry.

00:29:14.210 --> 00:29:15.770
This is where I lose everybody.

00:29:15.770 --> 00:29:15.990
Right?

00:29:15.990 --> 00:29:18.365
If I'm doing a music, the
people are just like, oh, yeah.

00:29:20.710 --> 00:29:22.520
Normally, I'll say, drugs!

00:29:22.520 --> 00:29:24.650
We'll do something to
try and get people back.

00:29:24.650 --> 00:29:27.210
But if you think
about it, I don't

00:29:27.210 --> 00:29:29.340
know if you've got
Googlers here who are like,

00:29:29.340 --> 00:29:30.410
hey, how's it going?

00:29:30.410 --> 00:29:33.680
I don't know how
you guys get along.

00:29:33.680 --> 00:29:37.370
But there's got to be some,
hey, record release party!

00:29:37.370 --> 00:29:39.050
Oh, I'm busy.

00:29:39.050 --> 00:29:40.900
I haven't told you
when it is yet.

00:29:40.900 --> 00:29:44.540
No, but I'm going to be busy.

00:29:44.540 --> 00:29:46.500
Nobody cares.

00:29:46.500 --> 00:29:49.290
Nobody cares.

00:29:49.290 --> 00:29:52.490
So why not have
your music release

00:29:52.490 --> 00:29:56.294
party, you'll launch whatever
it is, at a laundromat?

00:29:56.294 --> 00:29:57.710
Now the conversation
is different.

00:29:57.710 --> 00:29:59.860
Hey, we're having
a release party.

00:29:59.860 --> 00:30:01.220
Ooh.

00:30:01.220 --> 00:30:03.380
And everybody gets two
loads of laundry done.

00:30:03.380 --> 00:30:06.590
Oh, when is that?

00:30:06.590 --> 00:30:09.320
Let me dial that in on my phone.

00:30:09.320 --> 00:30:10.940
Boom!

00:30:10.940 --> 00:30:12.330
Because nobody cares.

00:30:12.330 --> 00:30:14.379
And sure, some people
will show up and just get

00:30:14.379 --> 00:30:15.170
their laundry done.

00:30:15.170 --> 00:30:16.640
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:19.440
Screw them.

00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:22.290
But you can manipulate
the situation.

00:30:22.290 --> 00:30:26.060
You can slide the owner
of the laundromat,

00:30:26.060 --> 00:30:29.070
$50 would probably do
it, to like, dial back

00:30:29.070 --> 00:30:31.960
the temperature on the dryers.

00:30:31.960 --> 00:30:34.900
So halfway in, you can
be like, hey, whoa.

00:30:34.900 --> 00:30:35.590
Hey, sorry.

00:30:35.590 --> 00:30:36.790
Terribly sorry.

00:30:36.790 --> 00:30:38.520
No disrespect to you, Mike.

00:30:38.520 --> 00:30:40.300
This is a fantastic laundromat.

00:30:40.300 --> 00:30:43.020
There is a problem
with the dryers.

00:30:43.020 --> 00:30:45.160
We're putting in a
more dryer sheets.

00:30:45.160 --> 00:30:47.550
We're going to keep
the party going.

00:30:47.550 --> 00:30:49.420
Somebody's brought
a case of beer.

00:30:49.420 --> 00:30:51.590
Let's listen to the
album one more time.

00:30:51.590 --> 00:30:52.770
And people are like, fuck.

00:30:52.770 --> 00:30:54.480
You know, what are
people going to do?

00:30:54.480 --> 00:30:56.260
You've got-- they're
held captive now

00:30:56.260 --> 00:31:00.010
by their own wet laundry.

00:31:00.010 --> 00:31:02.150
Right?

00:31:02.150 --> 00:31:04.740
And sure, five listen--

00:31:04.740 --> 00:31:07.250
yeah, two listens through
you could get away with,

00:31:07.250 --> 00:31:08.860
with some Red Bull,
some other stuff.

00:31:08.860 --> 00:31:11.490
But there will be people
who are going, screw those--

00:31:11.490 --> 00:31:12.940
screw that.

00:31:12.940 --> 00:31:15.910
But at least I got
clean underwear.

00:31:15.910 --> 00:31:19.660
I'm thinking, nine
days later, when

00:31:19.660 --> 00:31:23.350
they still got clean underwear,
they're like, screw those guys.

00:31:23.350 --> 00:31:24.550
Ha, ha, ha.

00:31:24.550 --> 00:31:26.590
I win!

00:31:26.590 --> 00:31:28.700
But you know what?

00:31:28.700 --> 00:31:31.400
Their songs are pretty good.

00:31:31.400 --> 00:31:32.780
Kind of like them.

00:31:32.780 --> 00:31:34.380
Let me dial that up again.

00:31:34.380 --> 00:31:36.091
I wonder if they're
playing close by.

00:31:36.091 --> 00:31:36.590
Right?

00:31:36.590 --> 00:31:38.990
That's that trust thing again.

00:31:38.990 --> 00:31:42.150
Nobody cares about
what's important to you.

00:31:42.150 --> 00:31:44.550
Everyone's got dirty underwear.

00:31:44.550 --> 00:31:45.180
You win.

00:31:48.410 --> 00:31:51.320
This is where we
lose everybody else.

00:31:51.320 --> 00:31:54.190
Get the fuck out of bed.

00:31:54.190 --> 00:31:55.720
I'm lucky.

00:31:55.720 --> 00:31:57.760
My kids are kind of grown now.

00:31:57.760 --> 00:32:01.330
[INAUDIBLE] is eight, is
going to be nine soon.

00:32:01.330 --> 00:32:05.130
But when he was three or four,
most mornings, ah, ah, ah!

00:32:05.130 --> 00:32:07.810
4:00, 4:30, 5:00, I'm
getting kicked in the back.

00:32:07.810 --> 00:32:11.200
I've got congealed puke
across the back of my neck,

00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:12.730
similar to some
of the situations

00:32:12.730 --> 00:32:17.020
I think you guys wake
up in most mornings.

00:32:17.020 --> 00:32:17.950
But here's the deal.

00:32:17.950 --> 00:32:19.380
I'm up at 5:00.

00:32:19.380 --> 00:32:22.000
I'm five hours ahead
of my archrival,

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:26.710
ironically the lead singer
in a band called Arch Rivals.

00:32:26.710 --> 00:32:27.430
Five hours.

00:32:27.430 --> 00:32:28.890
Big deal.

00:32:28.890 --> 00:32:31.220
But at the end of the
week, I'm 35 hours ahead.

00:32:34.580 --> 00:32:38.130
That's 1,000-- I know you've
done the math in your head.

00:32:38.130 --> 00:32:40.820
It's 1,820 hours a year!

00:32:40.820 --> 00:32:44.560
76 days ahead!

00:32:44.560 --> 00:32:46.880
That's the difference.

00:32:46.880 --> 00:32:50.030
Just in case you're wondering,
the "get the fuck out of bed"

00:32:50.030 --> 00:32:54.620
theme is also available as
fantastic performance art

00:32:54.620 --> 00:32:57.260
pillowcase set.

00:32:57.260 --> 00:32:59.900
And I'm not just a
crazy punk rocker.

00:32:59.900 --> 00:33:02.670
You can't just have these
slides up at Google.

00:33:02.670 --> 00:33:04.490
You have to have cats.

00:33:04.490 --> 00:33:07.680
The cats swung it.

00:33:07.680 --> 00:33:10.460
No, this get the fuck out
of-- oh, there's cats.

00:33:10.460 --> 00:33:13.220
I think those are
[INAUDIBLE] cats.

00:33:13.220 --> 00:33:15.170
"Dynasty" podcast cats.

00:33:15.170 --> 00:33:17.250
The "Dynasty" podcats.

00:33:17.250 --> 00:33:20.870
That's who that is.

00:33:20.870 --> 00:33:25.114
Couple of quotes before I
get to the big, huge stuff.

00:33:25.114 --> 00:33:26.030
This is Dale Carnegie.

00:33:26.030 --> 00:33:27.710
My dad sent me this quote.

00:33:27.710 --> 00:33:28.700
Thanks, Dad.

00:33:28.700 --> 00:33:30.620
"You can make more
friends in two months

00:33:30.620 --> 00:33:32.330
by being interested
in other people

00:33:32.330 --> 00:33:33.871
than you can make
in two years trying

00:33:33.871 --> 00:33:35.770
to get other people
interested in you."

00:33:35.770 --> 00:33:37.144
That should have,
like, asterisk,

00:33:37.144 --> 00:33:38.780
unless you do their laundry.

00:33:38.780 --> 00:33:40.130
You know?

00:33:40.130 --> 00:33:42.280
Love that quote.

00:33:42.280 --> 00:33:44.390
Here's another good
one about community.

00:33:44.390 --> 00:33:45.860
"A neighbor is
defined as one who

00:33:45.860 --> 00:33:50.180
resides 40 houses to one's
right, 40 houses to one's left,

00:33:50.180 --> 00:33:54.760
40 houses in front,
40 houses behind."

00:33:54.760 --> 00:33:58.370
I think that's the Quran.

00:33:58.370 --> 00:34:00.542
Always be nice to everyone.

00:34:00.542 --> 00:34:02.750
Be nicest to the people with
the least reason for you

00:34:02.750 --> 00:34:04.070
to be nice to them.

00:34:04.070 --> 00:34:06.920
You can't be strategic
about being nice.

00:34:06.920 --> 00:34:08.120
Just be nice.

00:34:08.120 --> 00:34:11.090
The good thing is,
there are some people,

00:34:11.090 --> 00:34:13.399
being nice to them, you'd
have to buy them a car.

00:34:13.399 --> 00:34:15.190
And if someone's at
that point where you've

00:34:15.190 --> 00:34:17.850
got to buy a car for them
to go, thanks for the car,

00:34:17.850 --> 00:34:20.330
the car isn't going to
make a difference anyway.

00:34:20.330 --> 00:34:23.960
The time to make a difference is
when it's a smile, a sandwich,

00:34:23.960 --> 00:34:25.770
not being an asshole.

00:34:25.770 --> 00:34:26.270
Right?

00:34:26.270 --> 00:34:28.670
That's a huge thing to
do, to be nice to someone.

00:34:28.670 --> 00:34:30.800
You don't know the context.

00:34:30.800 --> 00:34:34.940
Maybe their partner
just left them.

00:34:34.940 --> 00:34:38.030
Maybe they just got this
ridiculous electric bill,

00:34:38.030 --> 00:34:40.409
or a speeding
fine, or something.

00:34:40.409 --> 00:34:42.760
Just be nice.

00:34:42.760 --> 00:34:44.290
See what I did here?

00:34:44.290 --> 00:34:49.735
With the huge-- it's so big,
it's like a typography thing.

00:34:49.735 --> 00:34:51.110
We don't have to
get into it now.

00:34:51.110 --> 00:34:54.139
If you-- I'll be sticking
around afterwards.

00:34:54.139 --> 00:34:57.749
How do we put 20,000
fans in a stadium?

00:34:57.749 --> 00:34:59.165
I'm going to answer
that question,

00:34:59.165 --> 00:35:01.760
and more on my
subscription site.

00:35:04.460 --> 00:35:05.750
That's like a question, right?

00:35:05.750 --> 00:35:06.630
How do we do that?

00:35:06.630 --> 00:35:08.560
How do we get to there
on the Billboard chart?

00:35:08.560 --> 00:35:10.220
Yeah, don't know.

00:35:10.220 --> 00:35:12.740
I don't fucking know.

00:35:12.740 --> 00:35:14.810
But I know something.

00:35:14.810 --> 00:35:17.150
I know every single
person in this room

00:35:17.150 --> 00:35:20.990
could make friends with two
people, today, of all days.

00:35:20.990 --> 00:35:22.220
You want to?

00:35:22.220 --> 00:35:24.570
And we're not going to do
some, like, turn to the person

00:35:24.570 --> 00:35:26.400
to your left, punch
him in the face.

00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:27.740
We're not going to do it.

00:35:27.740 --> 00:35:29.510
But that's all this stuff is.

00:35:29.510 --> 00:35:32.280
If you make two
friends today, or six,

00:35:32.280 --> 00:35:33.950
I'm not going to do the math.

00:35:33.950 --> 00:35:36.190
We'll keep it at twos, right?

00:35:36.190 --> 00:35:37.520
Every day you make two friends.

00:35:37.520 --> 00:35:39.451
Now it gets a little
bit plate-spinny.

00:35:39.451 --> 00:35:41.450
You've got to stay in
touch with the friends you

00:35:41.450 --> 00:35:43.580
made eight weeks ago, right?

00:35:43.580 --> 00:35:45.380
You've got to keep
that plate spinning.

00:35:45.380 --> 00:35:47.060
But that's all it is.

00:35:47.060 --> 00:35:50.060
When you approach it as, how
do we put 20,000 people in--

00:35:50.060 --> 00:35:51.590
you're screwed.

00:35:51.590 --> 00:35:55.370
If you approach it as, I
could make two friends today.

00:35:55.370 --> 00:35:57.100
And you get better at it.

00:35:57.100 --> 00:35:59.840
You'll have days where
you make 20 friends, or 20

00:35:59.840 --> 00:36:02.315
potential longer-term
friends, right?

00:36:02.315 --> 00:36:05.510
And you'll have days where you
do some terrible stuff that

00:36:05.510 --> 00:36:07.710
doesn't make any difference.

00:36:07.710 --> 00:36:10.190
That's it.

00:36:10.190 --> 00:36:13.950
There isn't any huge stuff.

00:36:13.950 --> 00:36:15.720
There isn't huge stuff.

00:36:15.720 --> 00:36:19.090
There's just small
stuff plus time.

00:36:19.090 --> 00:36:20.190
That's all there is.

00:36:20.190 --> 00:36:22.970
And so we've all
been, like, what

00:36:22.970 --> 00:36:28.050
is that, we're like
Stockholm syndrome

00:36:28.050 --> 00:36:30.160
prisoners of music business.

00:36:30.160 --> 00:36:35.400
And the keyholders who want us
to believe, like, hoo hoo hoo!

00:36:35.400 --> 00:36:38.830
One day, it's
behind this curtain.

00:36:38.830 --> 00:36:40.860
Actually, there's a
door behind the curtain.

00:36:40.860 --> 00:36:42.210
We could go through there.

00:36:42.210 --> 00:36:44.070
There's another room
with more curtains.

00:36:44.070 --> 00:36:44.730
We'll pull the curtains.

00:36:44.730 --> 00:36:45.450
You get the key.

00:36:45.450 --> 00:36:48.930
That gets the key to the
digital combination of the--

00:36:48.930 --> 00:36:50.332
one day we'll take you there.

00:36:50.332 --> 00:36:51.540
I said, now what do you know?

00:36:51.540 --> 00:36:54.030
There's no fucking
secret to any of it.

00:36:54.030 --> 00:36:57.090
It's just one day,
making two friends.

00:36:57.090 --> 00:37:01.080
One day, making
two more friends.

00:37:01.080 --> 00:37:06.590
You know, when I came up,
a lot of really good things

00:37:06.590 --> 00:37:07.760
happened to me very quickly.

00:37:07.760 --> 00:37:09.590
I was on the front
cover of "Melody Maker."

00:37:09.590 --> 00:37:10.810
That was just weird as hell.

00:37:10.810 --> 00:37:14.480
Used to walk past the newsagents
on my way to my government job

00:37:14.480 --> 00:37:16.310
when I was 18 in London.

00:37:16.310 --> 00:37:18.560
And I'd see "Melody
Maker," "NME," "Sounds,"

00:37:18.560 --> 00:37:19.730
all those magazines.

00:37:19.730 --> 00:37:21.490
"Smash Hits," probably.

00:37:21.490 --> 00:37:24.910
And like, fantasize, like,
one day that could be me.

00:37:24.910 --> 00:37:26.780
At the age of 18, I'm
on the front cover.

00:37:26.780 --> 00:37:27.730
We're doing live television.

00:37:27.730 --> 00:37:28.479
We came over here.

00:37:28.479 --> 00:37:29.870
We did "American Bandstand."

00:37:29.870 --> 00:37:31.730
Went to Japan and
did all this stuff.

00:37:31.730 --> 00:37:36.500
But I had this smash and
grab mentality of, like,

00:37:36.500 --> 00:37:40.390
that I would have less time
than a superstar soccer player.

00:37:40.390 --> 00:37:41.230
Right?

00:37:41.230 --> 00:37:43.400
Like, we got two years!

00:37:43.400 --> 00:37:44.700
Grab that case of beer!

00:37:44.700 --> 00:37:48.260
We're-- not realizing, you
know, I met Joe Shanahan from

00:37:48.260 --> 00:37:49.370
the Metro in 1981.

00:37:49.370 --> 00:37:52.770
I still see him with his
kids at Dave &amp; Buster's.

00:37:52.770 --> 00:37:53.730
Right?

00:37:53.730 --> 00:37:55.460
You just don't think like that.

00:37:55.460 --> 00:37:58.530
You're just like, get the--
grab the bottle of whiskey.

00:38:01.430 --> 00:38:07.140
There's just relationships,
people, trust, and community.

00:38:07.140 --> 00:38:09.470
And once you start looking
at things like that,

00:38:09.470 --> 00:38:12.090
the efficiency thing
is just a no-brainer.

00:38:12.090 --> 00:38:12.920
It doesn't matter.

00:38:12.920 --> 00:38:16.910
If I'm creating a relationship
that could go on for--

00:38:16.910 --> 00:38:17.720
touch wood.

00:38:17.720 --> 00:38:20.370
Oh, there's no-- of course
there's no wood in this--

00:38:24.130 --> 00:38:28.150
relationships that could
go on for 30, 40, 50 years.

00:38:28.150 --> 00:38:32.720
The front end takes
whatever it takes.

00:38:32.720 --> 00:38:34.810
It's not one thing.

00:38:34.810 --> 00:38:37.450
It's 300.

00:38:37.450 --> 00:38:39.920
Or 420.

00:38:39.920 --> 00:38:40.990
Got the students back.

00:38:40.990 --> 00:38:43.250
Lost some students
with the laundry.

00:38:43.250 --> 00:38:44.310
Oh, yeah.

00:38:44.310 --> 00:38:45.430
This genius!

00:38:45.430 --> 00:38:46.940
It's genius, what
he's saying now.

00:38:46.940 --> 00:38:49.540
In big letters, 420.

00:38:49.540 --> 00:38:50.450
420 big.

00:38:50.450 --> 00:38:51.500
Oh, no, losing it.

00:38:51.500 --> 00:38:52.610
What's going on?

00:38:52.610 --> 00:38:58.070
420,000 is the number.

00:38:58.070 --> 00:39:00.651
Anybody know what
that number is?

00:39:00.651 --> 00:39:01.150
No.

00:39:01.150 --> 00:39:03.540
OK.

00:39:03.540 --> 00:39:08.704
It's how many cats you get
if you don't spay one cat.

00:39:08.704 --> 00:39:12.640
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:12.640 --> 00:39:14.667
Google it.

00:39:14.667 --> 00:39:17.162
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:17.162 --> 00:39:21.154
[APPLAUSE]

00:39:21.154 --> 00:39:21.660
Right.

00:39:21.660 --> 00:39:23.355
If you don't spay
a-- of course, it's

00:39:23.355 --> 00:39:27.690
not from that one cat, which
I think you were thinking.

00:39:27.690 --> 00:39:30.300
From all the cats that
come because of not spaying

00:39:30.300 --> 00:39:32.010
that cat, there's
probably eight,

00:39:32.010 --> 00:39:33.410
the first time it has a litter.

00:39:33.410 --> 00:39:34.050
Bum, bum, bum.

00:39:34.050 --> 00:39:39.700
So what we need to be is--

00:39:39.700 --> 00:39:41.380
well, we can't--
we got to spay--

00:39:41.380 --> 00:39:43.120
I don't want to say
we shouldn't-- right.

00:39:43.120 --> 00:39:49.480
But one of my kids said to
me, this marketing thing, Dad.

00:39:49.480 --> 00:39:52.640
It's like zombies.

00:39:52.640 --> 00:39:54.580
It's like a zombie thing.

00:39:54.580 --> 00:39:57.690
I'm like, where are you
going with this, son?

00:39:57.690 --> 00:40:01.985
[INAUDIBLE] and like, well, it's
like, a zombie bites a person,

00:40:01.985 --> 00:40:02.860
and then there's two.

00:40:02.860 --> 00:40:04.730
And then those two
zombies bite two more,

00:40:04.730 --> 00:40:05.660
but then there's four.

00:40:05.660 --> 00:40:07.785
It's like grains of wheat
on the chessboard, right?

00:40:07.785 --> 00:40:09.830
Eight, 16, 32.

00:40:09.830 --> 00:40:13.820
So my last piece
of advice to you

00:40:13.820 --> 00:40:18.704
is to be a not-spayed
zombie kitten.

00:40:18.704 --> 00:40:21.430
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:21.430 --> 00:40:23.780
That's the title
of my next book.

00:40:23.780 --> 00:40:25.470
That's rar, rar!

00:40:25.470 --> 00:40:27.380
Well, that's what we got to be.

00:40:27.380 --> 00:40:31.570
Not-spayed zombie kittens,
biting people, having--

00:40:31.570 --> 00:40:32.070
yeah.

00:40:36.020 --> 00:40:39.570
And of course, we always
need to throw muffins.

00:40:42.260 --> 00:40:44.942
That's my shit.

00:40:44.942 --> 00:40:47.846
[APPLAUSE]

00:40:55.600 --> 00:40:59.110
I don't have any control
over these bags of muffins.

00:40:59.110 --> 00:41:01.450
Is anybody desperate
for a muffin?

00:41:01.450 --> 00:41:02.860
It's not code.

00:41:02.860 --> 00:41:09.590
It's just-- once again, please,
eyes forward, eyes forward.

00:41:09.590 --> 00:41:10.280
Well, see?

00:41:12.800 --> 00:41:16.600
I just got Dan in the ear.

00:41:16.600 --> 00:41:22.520
One of my favorite moments
at South by Southwest,

00:41:22.520 --> 00:41:25.220
I picked up a box, right?

00:41:25.220 --> 00:41:28.120
And I thought I couldn't
get the little bags

00:41:28.120 --> 00:41:29.590
all the way to the back.

00:41:29.590 --> 00:41:33.190
I thought, well, I'll
just kick this, right?

00:41:33.190 --> 00:41:34.500
There was somebody sitting--

00:41:34.500 --> 00:41:37.720
it hit-- I've never-- you've
never heard such a bang.

00:41:37.720 --> 00:41:41.190
It just hit this
guy in the face.

00:41:41.190 --> 00:41:43.330
And we're still friends to
this day, which I just--

00:41:43.330 --> 00:41:45.490
I don't know why I'm
saying-- anybody want to go

00:41:45.490 --> 00:41:48.040
for the whole--

00:41:48.040 --> 00:41:50.465
it's easy sitting there with
your bags of muffins going,

00:41:50.465 --> 00:41:52.820
yeah, I thought, overall,
the talk was pretty good.

00:41:52.820 --> 00:41:55.240
He made some good points
and blah, blah, blah.

00:41:55.240 --> 00:41:59.470
People don't realize
the preparation that

00:41:59.470 --> 00:42:01.495
goes into something like this.

00:42:01.495 --> 00:42:03.760
Like, I'm sitting
up all night opening

00:42:03.760 --> 00:42:07.290
these bags, masturbating
into these bags,

00:42:07.290 --> 00:42:10.400
and then heat sealing.

00:42:10.400 --> 00:42:14.502
This is like, six or
seven hours, right there.

00:42:14.502 --> 00:42:18.220
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:18.220 --> 00:42:21.770
That's my-- that's me.

00:42:21.770 --> 00:42:22.690
Thank you.

00:42:22.690 --> 00:42:26.650
[APPLAUSE]
