Unit 7--this unit is going to be kind of a grab bag of things I didn't get to cover

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
in this class and lectures up until now.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Basically, it's going to be real-world issues and some decisions--

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
what I look for in a web framework, how we host our stuff--

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
things like that and some of the decision-making process.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
And we also spent a lot of time talking about Reddit.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.000
How we grew it to the extent that we can explain that and how we grew the architecture.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
And we'll also do a couple of interviews, one with my friend Neil,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
who is the lead engineer at Reddit now.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Another one with Udacity, the engineers at Udacity,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
who will explain how they use App Engine in the real world.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Now, I've only use App Engine really in the context of teaching this course,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
and built a number of small toy websites now.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
But, these guys can actually talk about what is like to use App Engine in production

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
on a site with thousands of users.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
There will be no quizzes. This is just for you to sit back and watch.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
If these things don't interest you, just skip ahead to the homework.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
If these things do interest you, welcome. It should be fun.
