00:00:00.267 --> 00:00:02.523
- [Voiceover] We have three
inequalities here that involve

00:00:02.523 --> 00:00:05.814
absolute values and then
below them we have potential

00:00:05.814 --> 00:00:07.114
values for x,

00:00:07.114 --> 00:00:09.654
and what I want to do in this
video is see which of these

00:00:09.654 --> 00:00:13.270
potential values for x actually
make the inequality true.

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:15.444
So let's start with
this first one in green,

00:00:15.444 --> 00:00:16.176
here on the left.

00:00:16.176 --> 00:00:18.776
It says the absolute
value of x is less than

00:00:18.776 --> 00:00:22.067
the absolute value of negative seven.

00:00:22.067 --> 00:00:23.754
So let's think about
which of these x values

00:00:23.754 --> 00:00:25.339
would make this true.

00:00:25.339 --> 00:00:27.655
And before I even try out the x values,

00:00:27.655 --> 00:00:30.011
let's see if we can
simplify this inequality.

00:00:30.011 --> 00:00:32.226
Now the thing that might jump
out at you and encourage you

00:00:32.226 --> 00:00:34.136
to try these on your own
before I work through them,

00:00:34.136 --> 00:00:35.944
what might jump out at you is that we know

00:00:35.944 --> 00:00:38.300
what the absolute value
of negative seven is.

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.068
The absolute value of
negative seven is how far

00:00:40.068 --> 00:00:43.116
from zero is negative seven?

00:00:43.116 --> 00:00:44.680
Well, it's seven to the left.

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:47.382
The distance from negative
seven to zero is seven,

00:00:47.382 --> 00:00:49.109
or another way to think about it is

00:00:49.109 --> 00:00:53.051
the absolute value of any
number is always going to be

00:00:53.051 --> 00:00:55.225
the non-negative version of it.

00:00:55.225 --> 00:00:58.415
So this right over here,
absolute value of negative seven

00:00:58.415 --> 00:01:00.548
is just going to be seven.

00:01:00.548 --> 00:01:02.844
So an equivalent inequality
would be that the

00:01:02.844 --> 00:01:06.724
absolute value of x needs
to be less than seven.

00:01:06.724 --> 00:01:09.873
So let's see if its true
for x equals negative eight.

00:01:09.873 --> 00:01:11.864
So if x equals negative eight,

00:01:11.864 --> 00:01:14.953
then wherever we see the x we
put a negative eight there.

00:01:14.953 --> 00:01:17.309
So let's see, is the absolute
value of negative eight

00:01:17.309 --> 00:01:20.560
less than seven?

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:22.003
Is that true?

00:01:22.003 --> 00:01:23.750
Well, the absolute value of negative eight

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:26.086
is just going to be eight,

00:01:26.086 --> 00:01:28.077
so is eight less than seven?

00:01:28.077 --> 00:01:29.987
No, it's greater than seven.

00:01:29.987 --> 00:01:32.507
So that, x equals negative eight does not

00:01:32.507 --> 00:01:34.579
satisfy the inequality.

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:37.078
Now x equals negative two?

00:01:37.078 --> 00:01:39.089
Well, wherever we see an x,
let's put a negative two.

00:01:39.089 --> 00:01:41.913
So the absolute value
of negative two needs

00:01:41.913 --> 00:01:43.518
to be less than seven.

00:01:43.518 --> 00:01:46.119
What's the absolute value of negative two?

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:48.856
Well it's going to be positive two.

00:01:48.856 --> 00:01:51.505
Is positive two less than seven?

00:01:51.505 --> 00:01:53.558
Sure, two is less than seven.

00:01:53.558 --> 00:01:57.621
So this, this is x equals negative two,

00:01:57.621 --> 00:02:00.079
satisfies our inequality.

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:03.147
The absolute value of negative
two is going to be less than

00:02:03.147 --> 00:02:05.220
the absolute value of negative seven.

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:07.658
Then, finally, x equals six.

00:02:07.658 --> 00:02:10.340
So the absolute value is
the absolute value of six.

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.123
Once again, everywhere I see
the x I just put the six there.

00:02:13.123 --> 00:02:14.484
X equals six.

00:02:14.484 --> 00:02:15.906
We're going to say the
absolute value of six,

00:02:15.906 --> 00:02:18.731
is that less than seven?

00:02:18.731 --> 00:02:21.839
Well the absolute value of
six is once again, just six,

00:02:21.839 --> 00:02:24.419
Six is six to the right of zero.

00:02:24.419 --> 00:02:26.248
Is six less than seven?

00:02:26.248 --> 00:02:28.787
Yeah, sure, six is less than seven.

00:02:28.787 --> 00:02:32.201
So x equals six and x equals negative two

00:02:32.201 --> 00:02:35.100
both satisfy the inequality.

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:38.595
Now let's do this one here
in this magenta color.

00:02:38.595 --> 00:02:40.586
And once again, encourage
you to pause the video

00:02:40.586 --> 00:02:42.719
and try to work through
it out on your own.

00:02:42.719 --> 00:02:44.954
Let's try x equals negative four.

00:02:44.954 --> 00:02:47.392
So if x equals negative four,

00:02:47.392 --> 00:02:49.769
we're going to say the
absolute value of negative four

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:52.105
is greater than five.

00:02:52.105 --> 00:02:53.670
Absolute value of negative four,

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:55.559
well that's just going to be four.

00:02:55.559 --> 00:02:58.871
Is four greater than five?

00:02:58.871 --> 00:03:00.801
No, four is less than five.

00:03:00.801 --> 00:03:02.975
So that doesn't work.

00:03:02.975 --> 00:03:04.499
Now, x equals three.

00:03:04.499 --> 00:03:07.120
Everywhere we see the x,
replace it with a three.

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.644
The absolute value of three,

00:03:08.644 --> 00:03:10.391
is that greater than five?

00:03:10.391 --> 00:03:12.626
Absolute value of three is just three,

00:03:12.626 --> 00:03:14.353
so is three greater than five?

00:03:14.353 --> 00:03:16.791
No, three is less than five.

00:03:16.791 --> 00:03:18.599
I think you're seeing, hopefully you're

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:19.899
getting the hang of it.

00:03:19.899 --> 00:03:22.043
So finally, if x equals negative nine.

00:03:22.043 --> 00:03:25.029
The absolute value of
negative nine, that would

00:03:25.029 --> 00:03:27.244
need to be greater than five.

00:03:27.244 --> 00:03:29.215
Absolute value of negative nine,

00:03:29.215 --> 00:03:30.942
well that's just going
to be positive nine.

00:03:30.942 --> 00:03:32.404
So it's just going to be nine,

00:03:32.404 --> 00:03:34.802
and is that greater than five?

00:03:34.802 --> 00:03:36.915
Well, sure, nine is greater than five.

00:03:36.915 --> 00:03:40.531
So x equals negative nine
satisfies the inequality.

00:03:40.531 --> 00:03:42.725
All right, now let's do these ones

00:03:42.725 --> 00:03:44.981
in this light purple color.

00:03:44.981 --> 00:03:48.333
The absolute value of x
needs to be greater than

00:03:48.333 --> 00:03:49.877
negative 16.

00:03:49.877 --> 00:03:52.600
So there's something very
interesting about this one.

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:54.469
We don't even have to
look at the choices here.

00:03:54.469 --> 00:03:58.918
Can you think of any x for
which this would not be true?

00:03:58.918 --> 00:04:01.194
Well just think about it a little bit.

00:04:01.194 --> 00:04:02.799
The absolute value of a number,

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:05.471
is it ever going to be negative?

00:04:05.471 --> 00:04:08.376
No, the absolute value
of a number is going

00:04:08.376 --> 00:04:10.997
to be zero or positive.

00:04:10.997 --> 00:04:12.541
It's going to be non-negative,

00:04:12.541 --> 00:04:16.360
so this right over here
is zero or positive,

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:18.514
or we could call that non-negative.

00:04:18.514 --> 00:04:21.338
Zero or positive.

00:04:21.338 --> 00:04:23.878
So if this thing over
here is zero or positive,

00:04:23.878 --> 00:04:26.174
something that is zero or greater,

00:04:26.174 --> 00:04:28.815
something that is zero
or positive is always

00:04:28.815 --> 00:04:30.989
going to be greater
than a negative number.

00:04:30.989 --> 00:04:34.869
So this is actually true for all x's.

00:04:34.869 --> 00:04:36.109
We don't even have to try them out.

00:04:36.109 --> 00:04:37.876
We could try them out,
actually we will try them out,

00:04:37.876 --> 00:04:38.912
just so you see that,

00:04:38.912 --> 00:04:40.436
but it's going to be true for all x's,

00:04:40.436 --> 00:04:41.818
because when you take the absolute value,

00:04:41.818 --> 00:04:44.560
if you take, if x is zero
it's going to be zero,

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:47.445
but for any other value,
any non-zero value of x,

00:04:47.445 --> 00:04:50.351
the absolute value of it
is going to be positive.

00:04:50.351 --> 00:04:52.382
And let's just see that,
we could put any x there,

00:04:52.382 --> 00:04:54.536
and this statement's going to be true.

00:04:54.536 --> 00:04:57.015
Absolute value of x equals negative 15.

00:04:57.015 --> 00:04:58.762
Well, the absolute value of negative 15,

00:04:58.762 --> 00:05:01.342
is that greater than negative 16?

00:05:01.342 --> 00:05:02.744
Well, the absolute value of negative 15

00:05:02.744 --> 00:05:05.832
is positive 15, and of course positive 15

00:05:05.832 --> 00:05:07.783
is going to be greater than negative 16.

00:05:07.783 --> 00:05:10.343
A positive is always going to
be greater than a negative.

00:05:10.343 --> 00:05:12.090
So this is true.

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:14.518
If x equals three,
absolute value of three,

00:05:14.518 --> 00:05:16.326
is that greater than negative 16?

00:05:16.326 --> 00:05:18.399
Oh, whoops let me write it that way.

00:05:18.399 --> 00:05:22.584
Absolute value of three, is
that greater than negative 16?

00:05:22.584 --> 00:05:24.291
Sure, absolute value of three is three.

00:05:24.291 --> 00:05:26.853
And three is positive, so it's going to be

00:05:26.853 --> 00:05:27.877
greater than a negative number.

00:05:27.877 --> 00:05:29.075
So that works.

00:05:29.075 --> 00:05:31.109
And as I said, any x would work there.

00:05:31.109 --> 00:05:33.060
And finally if x equals nine.

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:36.432
Well, absolute value of
nine, if x equals nine,

00:05:36.432 --> 00:05:39.317
is that greater than negative 16?

00:05:39.317 --> 00:05:41.085
Well sure, that's just nine,

00:05:41.085 --> 00:05:43.503
and that is greater than negative 16.

00:05:43.503 --> 00:05:45.799
Even if x was zero, then
you would have zero is

00:05:45.799 --> 00:05:49.923
greater than negative 16,
which is absolutely true.

00:05:49.923 --> 00:05:53.923
So any x here works.
