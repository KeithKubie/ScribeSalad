Speaker 1:          00:00          Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich. This is Radiolab and today. Do you want to say that today's a speed z? This is the perfect example of what we've been bumping into. All our humans are slow. We're just too slow, but now you have to know this Lena. It is all right. Now we have a story that should make us all feel a little better. Can I just say, I didn't even think this was remotely possible but we're about to talk about the heroine of our story. Is Lena Vestigo or how is that a hyphenate vista go is my middle name. How is the last name and my first name is lead. Selena is a physicist at Harvard and she has done something with speed that is just remarkable. It's the only way to say it. If we sort of stepped back once we asked her to walk us through what she does step by step because it's totally worth it.

Speaker 1:          00:49          We start out with a clump of room temperature sodium and at room temperature. Sodium is actually a nice shiny metal. Lina and her team, they take the sodium, they put it oven and heat it up. Exactly. And as it heats up, Adam's in the sodium start to vibrate faster and then faster, uh, when the temperature gets to around 350 degrees centigrade, the Adams form of vapor, super high pressure. And then she forces the Adams to this little pinhole have a little hole in the source. So this thin stream of Adams now comes out of a hole and we hit them head on with a laser beam. So you bang them right in their pathway? Yes. Kick them in a direction opposite to their emotion and that slows them down. Excited. And now we can load them into what we call an optical molasses optical molester. This is so baroque.

Speaker 1:          01:48          I love it. In the obstacle. Molasses, the ams, will you be hit by laser beams from all directions? Is that your way of like saying don't go this way, don't go this way. Don't go this way. Straight. Yes. You corner them in from all angles. Yes. Then we can get them to where really slow down. It feels a little bit like you've enslaved these Adams. I feel bad for them. It's going to get worse. Yes. Because that's not good enough. Now that she has these alums trapped, she needs to make them sit as still as possible.

Speaker 1:          02:19          So she turns off the laser's told darkness in the lab and then we turn on an electromagnet, use the fact that he used the fact that the Adam says small magnets to hold them in a particular point in space so they don't all fly apart. Then we can flip the magnet of this small Adams and selectively kick out the hardest. Just the hardest of them. So they will fly out of the magnet and we just keep a, the lowest energy by flipping them. You can say to the, there's one Adam, that's a little bit too jumpy. You say, get out of here. Get out of here cause you, cause you want just quietest Adams to stay. That's right. So now after all this, Lina has this teeny little cloud. Oh 0.1 millimeter in size. Typically just a few million atoms, like five, 10 million. And she says at this point, they're all very, very still because temperature is really just a measure of speed really. You know when Adam's are moving quickly, we call that hot. When they're moving slowly, we call that cold. These Adam's because they're so still, these atoms are really cold, colder than anything on earth. Colder than the middle of empty space. Basically. These are the coldest things that have ever been cold. Yeah. And at that point we have a tone of new state of matter

Speaker 2:          03:44          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          03:45          and of course she was curious about this new state of matters. That's right. I am a curious lady and now we get to the part where, uh, this is the whole reason we're telling you this. She now decides to poke this Adams basically a center light, Paulson shoot a beam of light into this called Adam cloud and see how hard we act. You know, we have a total in, what was it like when, you know, light fascinates me. I mean she says, here's this thing that goes 671 million miles an hour, you know, that nothing goes faster than light. And the question just occurred to her like what would happen if I took the fastest thing in the universe and stuck it into the coldest thing ever made. Exactly. Yes. So she points or laser Epi, adding the laser beam hits a switch. So here you have this, a light poles coming in, zooming through space. Then the front edge will reach our Adam cloud and unbelievably the light bulbs in that moment from 186,000 miles per second to 15 miles per hour. Are you kidding? No. So the light is going like

Speaker 2:          04:54          right?

Speaker 1:          04:56          That's right. Wow. In Oh Adam cloud. Amazing.

Speaker 2:          05:01          So,

Speaker 1:          05:04          and then it just chugs along at a leisurely speed. Something that you could beat on your bicycle and ride your bike faster than the light. Exactly. You can sort of think of this race between a bicycle and the light pearls. I mean, imagine you could just bike next to this blob of light and you could reach out and maybe pad it a little bit, then bike on a head, but then you'd be in darkness, but you can go and go maybe to the edge of the cloud and wait for the lights. And it's all that when it comes through, you could just catch it. Well, no, you can't catch it because when the light gets to the other side of the item, Cloud d, the front edge will accelerate back up to this enormous normal lightspeed. And then it rushes off. It stretches out again.

Speaker 1:          05:56          So here, can you, oh, go ahead. I'm sorry. So, so if you've got it down to 15, is that a kind of, uh, uh, like a, uh, a limit? I mean, can you, can we, we could, we could bring it Lloyd. It's, it's not a stoplight. Can you actually stop light? We can, yeah. So that laser goes in and doesn't come out. Yes. I mean, you hold it like a, like a, we hold it. How do you do that? Huh. Okay. So what we do is a, it's actually, uh, okay, so things get a little technical here, but basically, probably too simply, Lena has figured out a way to tweak the properties of this Adam cloud. She can make it like a brick that like bounces off of or she can make it clear. So like cruises through, in this case, what she does is she shoots the light into the Adam cloud. So we slow it down and then right at that moment, because it's chugging along, Chuck Chuck Chuck at 15 miles an hour, she tweaks the Adam cloud to make it well thick and the light parts will say, oops. Uh, it'll come to a heart almost like it's frozen,

Speaker 2:          06:57          ah,

Speaker 1:          06:57          in a block of ice in this. Oh, so just sits. Yes, it just sits. Wow. When you, when, when you realize what you done, did you do a little a Jig or what did you do you have? Oh, yes, there was amazing. There is like sitting in the lab of course, in the middle of the night and just knowing, Whoa, you're the first one who has been in this part of nature. Yeah, it was joy.

Speaker 2:          07:23          No,

Speaker 1:          07:23          you know, of course, to some extent I'm an engineer, but this whole idea that I can take this light poles and bring it down to a human scale, that's something you just, uh, at a very personal level gets excited about. This is more like, you know, I mean, you can sort of say a, you know, like, like, like, like, uh, a sculpturer will, will create a beautiful sculpture for me, as I was thinking about this, actually, think of it in terms of painting, like Vermeer, you know, the painter, like, he could create this illusion that light was just suspended there on the canvas. Just shimmering. Yeah. You Timo captured the light, but that was just an illusion. Lena actually did it. Yes.

Speaker 2:          08:17          Woo.

Speaker 1:          08:17          Do you ever, do you ever wonder, do you ever like, you know, after this night you walk out in, into the log and imagine next day in the sun is shining and you just look at the light and you think, Huh, Oh, I've got your number. You're like, Zeus. No. You could resist for a moment, perhaps being Scandinavian, right. Where we love the uh, light around midsummer. Yeah. You have a whole lot of it or then a whole lot. Yes. Yeah, yeah. Maybe you could do something about that. Maybe you can store it for the winter time. You could store it up and then you could unleash the cloud and suddenly there'd be sunshine. When there other men there was darkness. So save it. Save it for the winter time. Yes. Yeah. We've been doing this for a number of years. One of the more remarkable conversations. Thank you very much. This is wonderful. But you didn't get through a real important, oh wait, whoa, whoa, whoa. What? So, um, we can play a trick. The twig is, we can stop and extinguish the light parts in one part of space and we vive it in a totally different location. You mean you can transport hands port it. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          09:29          At this point we were like, what weird ass science fiction movie did we just slip into? Lena says, when the light hit those atoms back in her cloud, they're like, pulse cloud will create a little imprint in the atoms. It's like if you were to punch soft clay with your hand and then you could see the imprint of your knuckles there in the clay. That's what happens when the light hits those atoms. The Light Poles will change the atoms a little bit. That's how it imprints. It's inflammation in the atoms and according to Lena, that imprint, it's like a physical impression of the light. All the information about volite, it's frequency, energy, whatever. All that stuff is copied in the atoms. So there's shadow of light. Does that mean it's a shadow of light? Yes. And now we can put poulet imprint out. So now what we have out in free space is a perfect Matta copy.

Speaker 1:          10:16          You mean like physical matter? Yes. And then we can move that around. We can put it on the shelf four, we can move it around, we can squish it and then we can take it all. If she wants to, she can then make a few tweaks to the cloud. Then the light pulse will come back to life propagates slowly through the cloud and then excellent. Speed back up. So you could store, I mean if you were, if you were President Obama and you said, I would like to put it, put the light around me right now in a time capsule for later generations to experience, he could take it using your process, put it in an archive somewhere, and then putting a bottle in thousand years later they would, they would know the light that surrounded him. Yes. No, that's what she said. How would you know that different light is the same?

Speaker 1:          10:59          How do you know? Oh, that's the same light. It's a contained in my medical RP that preserves the information. So when the new light turns on, it identically copies the light from before in a way that that makes it as as specific as saying, that's Mary Kay Jones again. Yes, that's right. Oh Man. I've also also also wonder about, you know, because we could, in our lab in Cambridge, we could send a light person, stop it, extinguish it, make our own little medical. We put it in a bottle. I could put it in a suitcase, say bring it to Copenhagen, turn it into light. But I've thought about also, how do I get that bottle? So security in the airport, what would it look like? Would it just be a bottle full of a full of emptiness? It would be a vacuum, but there'll be a little clump of atoms in there. We'll have to be less than three ounces of Adam's or they would have so much less than three. Yeah. You could just walk through the airport. You've got no problems. Yeah. Oh, you can open it and be like, you want to see some cool blind him and then that would probably be also against the law. Yes. How am I going to get my light through security?
