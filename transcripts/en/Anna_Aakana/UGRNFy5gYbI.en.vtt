00:00:00.225 --> 00:00:01.581
So a year and a half ago,

00:00:01.581 --> 00:00:04.617
I posted a video called,
"AM I SEXY?"

00:00:04.617 --> 00:00:08.974
Am I sexy? Does--Does one have to FEEL
sexy to--to be sexy?

00:00:08.974 --> 00:00:11.382
And--and do I have to TRY to be sexy?

00:00:11.382 --> 00:00:15.384
Or can I just like wake up one day and
"I'M SEXY TODAY. YEAH!"

00:00:15.384 --> 00:00:18.531
And...overall the answer was no,
I don't feel that way,

00:00:18.531 --> 00:00:22.469
I've never felt that way,
I feel like an alien in my own body.

00:00:22.469 --> 00:00:23.698
What are you?

00:00:23.698 --> 00:00:25.714
And I left that video a little open-ended

00:00:25.714 --> 00:00:27.530
with how I was going to pursue

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:31.067
trying to gain this mysterious software
they call "sexiness"

00:00:31.067 --> 00:00:34.883
because it was sort of necessary
in my occupation and my overall life.

00:00:34.883 --> 00:00:36.412
18 months later,

00:00:36.412 --> 00:00:37.590
Am I sexy?

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:38.413
Yes.

00:00:38.413 --> 00:00:39.560
Yes, I fucking am.

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:40.990
I've got it, I downloaded it,

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:42.835
I leveled it up, that's me now.

00:00:42.835 --> 00:00:44.152
And so I figured I'd make a video

00:00:44.152 --> 00:00:45.443
following up to that,

00:00:45.443 --> 00:00:49.260
and what various contributions I thought totalled me

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.653
now feeling comfortable in my own skin.

00:00:51.653 --> 00:00:55.030
Because I feel like that's one of the biggest things

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:56.652
that females struggle with.

00:00:56.652 --> 00:00:59.561
Maybe even males, I'm not a male,
so I don't know.

00:00:59.561 --> 00:01:01.682
I'll never know what a boner feels like..

00:01:01.682 --> 00:01:03.651
Anyway, so you want to know how to be sexy?

00:01:03.651 --> 00:01:05.228
Here are the steps that I took:

00:01:05.228 --> 00:01:08.852
1. Find someone you find sexy.

00:01:08.852 --> 00:01:10.777
For me that was a girl named
Katie.

00:01:10.777 --> 00:01:12.096
I thought Katie was the

00:01:12.096 --> 00:01:12.384
BOMB

00:01:12.384 --> 00:01:12.682
DOT

00:01:12.682 --> 00:01:13.290
COM.

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.698
Katie did pole dancing, she did aerial silks,

00:01:15.698 --> 00:01:18.020
she was gonna get her pilot's license,

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.501
I was like, "GIRL, YOU SO FINE
YOU BLOWIN MY MIND RIGHT NOW."

00:01:21.501 --> 00:01:25.535
2. Copy everything that person does.

00:01:25.535 --> 00:01:28.430
I did all of the above activities
except for pilots license

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:30.091
I opted for motorcycle license.

00:01:30.091 --> 00:01:31.411
But now I want to get my pilot license

00:01:31.411 --> 00:01:32.258
because Katie has one

00:01:32.258 --> 00:01:33.412
and I want one too!

00:01:33.412 --> 00:01:35.653
3. Work out.

00:01:35.653 --> 00:01:36.897
I know we all hate working out

00:01:36.897 --> 00:01:38.152
working out sucks, blah blah blah

00:01:38.152 --> 00:01:39.245
No it doesn't!

00:01:39.245 --> 00:01:40.531
Working out is great.

00:01:40.531 --> 00:01:41.714
Yes, it is hard work,

00:01:41.714 --> 00:01:43.999
but it gives you endorphins.

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:45.968
Endorphins make you happy.

00:01:45.968 --> 00:01:47.091
Being happy

00:01:47.091 --> 00:01:48.320
makes you feel confident.

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:49.351
Feeling confident

00:01:49.351 --> 00:01:50.561
makes you feel sexy.

00:01:50.561 --> 00:01:52.060
And I hate to be that person that's like,

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:53.091
"I love working out!"

00:01:53.091 --> 00:01:55.472
because we all want to shoot that person in the face,

00:01:55.472 --> 00:01:56.413
but just do it.

00:01:56.413 --> 00:01:57.214
And that's it!

00:01:57.214 --> 00:01:59.030
That's all I did for a year and a half

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:01.198
was that I worked out and I copied Katie

00:02:01.198 --> 00:02:03.202
and I tried to feel good about myself,

00:02:03.202 --> 00:02:04.698
and slowly but surely,

00:02:04.698 --> 00:02:06.760
(softly) It happened. WOOOOOW

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:07.943
who would've guessed?

00:02:07.943 --> 00:02:10.653
Good luck on your journey to sexiness.

00:02:10.653 --> 00:02:12.825
(softly) I believe in you.

00:02:12.825 --> 00:02:13.972
Stay awesome, Gotham.

00:02:14.969 --> 00:02:17.590
Listen ladies, you sexy thing.

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:19.361
Use it--Look at the camera, Congress!
You're not vlogging right!

00:02:19.361 --> 00:02:19.861
