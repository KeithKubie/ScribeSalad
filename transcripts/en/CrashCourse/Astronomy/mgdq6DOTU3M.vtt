00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:07.140
Hey everyone. Phil Plait here with Crash Course
Astronomy…for one last time.

00:00:07.149 --> 00:00:11.269
We’ve come a long way together, you and
I, from the banging beginning of the Universe

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:17.200
to its far, far, future; from subatomic scales
to superclusters of galaxies. We’ve watched

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:21.500
the sky, mapped how it looks to us from the
ground, and then sailed out into the black

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.930
to investigate its denizens up close.

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:28.250
And — one of my favorite parts — we’ve
seen how human beings, people like you and

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:32.640
me, have worked over the centuries to figure
all this stuff out. We’re pretty clever

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.910
for a bunch of apes who only recently figured
out how to walk upright.

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.840
But after all the topics we’ve covered here,
all the space we’ve explored, there’s

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.380
still one more thing I want to talk about
that didn’t quite fit anywhere else in the

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:48.760
series. It’s yet another fascination of
mine, and judging from talking to so many

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.899
people over the years, it’s something important
to a lot of us.

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.979
Which doesn’t surprise me. I think asking
this question is a deeply human thing to do,

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:59.929
perhaps ironically part of what makes us who
we are.

00:00:59.929 --> 00:01:01.649
And it’s simply put, too.

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.009
Are we alone?

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:19.320
When people ask me what field of
astronomy is the most exciting right now,
I don’t even hesitate: Exoplanets.

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:26.220
I talked about these back in Episode 27; alien worlds,
planets orbiting other stars. The first were

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:32.320
discovered in 1992, and now we know of THOUSANDS,
with many thousands more awaiting confirmation.

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:37.240
Most of these exoplanets are giants, far more
massive than Earth and likely to have very

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:41.690
thick atmospheres like Neptune or Jupiter.
They also orbit so close to their host stars

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:43.200
that they’re hotter than Venus.

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.720
But as our techniques got better, we started
finding smaller planets farther out, and now

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.990
we have a short list of planets that could
very well be Earth-like in many ways. Close

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.770
to our size, density, temperature, surface
gravity…but that’s all we know. With our

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:00.729
current abilities, these planets are on the
thin bleeding edge of what we can observe.

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:06.149
Do they have atmospheres? If they do, do they
have a copious amount of oxygen in their atmospheres?

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:11.800
That would be a critical observation: In Earth-like
atmospheres, oxygen molecules are extremely

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:15.610
reactive chemically, and won’t last long
without being replenished. The easiest way

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:18.040
we know to do that is biology.

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:22.340
It’s not the only way, so it’s no guarantee
— there are some other processes that can

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:27.130
produce and maintain oxygen in a planet’s
atmosphere — but seeing it would be a good

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:31.950
sign, and there are other fragile molecules
that, if detected, would strengthen the idea

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:33.490
of biological activity.

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:39.360
Detecting the presence of O2 in an exoplanet’s
atmosphere is just tantalizingly out of reach

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:41.569
right now. We can almost do it.

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:46.020
We may not have to wait too much longer, though.
The James Webb Space Telescope, the successor

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:51.470
to Hubble, is a gigantic infrared space telescope
currently scheduled to launch in late 2018.

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:55.080
It should be able to tease apart the light
from some of the nearer and brighter of these

00:02:55.080 --> 00:03:00.820
distant worlds and look for the signature of oxygen,
as well as other biologically produced gases.

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:06.280
Still, finding them in an Earth-sized planet
may be beyond James Webb, too. NASA has studies

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:11.900
looking into space telescopes specifically designed
to look for alien Earths, but that’s a ways off yet.

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:17.599
But think of it. When I was a kid there were
nine planets — OK, eight. Now we have thousands,

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:21.390
and they’re not at all what we expected.
The diversity of worlds is stunning, with

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:26.599
some hot, some cold, some big, some little,
some in solar systems so compact they can

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:30.979
fit five planets inside the orbit of Mercury,
and some with planets far-flung.

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:35.500
Nature is more clever than we are. Sometimes,
I think that if something’s possible to

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:37.200
do, Nature’s done it somewhere.

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:42.140
But what’s more amazing to me is that we
now think that most — MOST — stars in

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:47.060
the galaxy have planets. Given that multiple
planets orbiting each star is common, that

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:50.880
means there are likely more planets than stars
in our galaxy.

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:54.680
And there are over 200 billion stars in our
galaxy.

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:59.430
I also want to point out that we see traces
of life on Earth going back nearly 4 billion

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:05.350
years. There was certainly life before that, but didn’t
leave evidence we can find so many eons later.

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:10.360
That timing is interesting: This means life
existed on Earth not too long after it cooled

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:15.280
enough to have liquid water on its surface.
That in turn strongly implies getting life

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:20.359
started on planets is easy. The ancient Earth
was a tough place to live, yet life took hold

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:22.839
within a few hundred million years after it
formed.

00:04:22.839 --> 00:04:24.849
Put this all together, and what do you get?

00:04:24.849 --> 00:04:29.930
If the galaxy is filled with planets and life
gets its start so easily, the galaxy may be

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:34.599
filled with life! We need more evidence, more
observations, but that’s the way the numbers

00:04:34.599 --> 00:04:39.740
lean. Mind you, I’m not talking about intelligent
life — just life itself. But still, that’s

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:41.840
just about the coolest thing I can imagine.

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:43.700
So, are they out there?

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:47.830
This is a question I am always asked when
I give public talks. “Do you believe in

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:52.350
UFOs and aliens?” My answer is always the
same: No, and yes.

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:56.940
Given what I just said, it seems inevitable
that life exists out there in the Universe.

00:04:56.949 --> 00:05:01.319
The conditions for life to arise are easy
to make, and there are a lot of chances for

00:05:01.319 --> 00:05:04.979
it out there. On the other hand, for most
of Earth’s history the most advanced life

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:11.680
was basically algae. Complex life, life capable
of intelligent thought, is a relatively recent development.

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:16.880
So alien life, sure. But aliens sophisticated
enough that they can come here to pose for

00:05:16.889 --> 00:05:22.129
blurry photos, abduct people, and slice up
cows? I’m not buying it. The evidence just

00:05:22.129 --> 00:05:26.809
isn’t there, and now that so many people
walk around with cameras, we see even fewer

00:05:26.809 --> 00:05:31.180
reports of mysterious lights in the sky than
we used to – or, at least, most of these

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:36.369
lights seen are explainable. Wedding lanterns,
balloons, Venus, meteors, the Moon, satellites,

00:05:36.369 --> 00:05:41.829
and so on. I’ll note astronomers are watching
the skies literally all the time. If UFOs

00:05:41.829 --> 00:05:44.829
were real WE’D be reporting the vast majority
of them!

00:05:44.829 --> 00:05:49.779
That doesn’t mean aliens aren’t out there,
though. Space is big – remember, folks,

00:05:49.779 --> 00:05:54.359
that’s why we call it “space” – and
getting here is a huge pain in the butt…or

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:56.479
whatever aliens use to excrete waste matter.

00:05:56.479 --> 00:06:00.809
It takes a vast amount of energy to accelerate
a spaceship to the speeds needed to travel

00:06:00.809 --> 00:06:05.990
to other planets. Even then, that’s slow
compared to the speed of light. Not only that,

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:10.179
light is easy to make. You don’t need a
lot of super sophisticated tech to make radio

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:15.980
waves, and it’s easy to embed a lot of information
in them. After all, that’s how radios and wifi work.

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:20.300
So why go to all the trouble of meeting other
life forms in person when you can chat via

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:23.360
radio? This is the premise behind SETI.

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:27.969
The Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence,
that is. This is based on a simple idea: If

00:06:27.969 --> 00:06:33.089
aliens are out there, it’s easier to stay
home and talk via radio than through the interstellar

00:06:33.089 --> 00:06:34.820
version of the Pony Express.

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:40.280
There are a lot of assumptions built into
this idea, of course. One is that, well, aliens

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:44.119
exist. The next is that they’re much more
technologically advanced than we are. But

00:06:44.119 --> 00:06:48.110
that makes sense. Any aliens that don’t
have tech can’t communicate with us, so

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:52.270
they don’t play into this. And we know how
quickly our technology advances; we’re just

00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:58.149
starting out and already have some pretty cool gizmos.
Give us a hundred years, a thousand, and where will we be?

00:06:58.149 --> 00:07:02.969
The Earth is over 4.5 billion years old, but
we’ve detected exoplanets far older than

00:07:02.969 --> 00:07:07.300
that. Life there might be that much more advanced
than we are. They might communicate with each

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:11.969
other using neutrinos, or ripples in spacetime,
or quantum entanglement, or some method we

00:07:11.969 --> 00:07:16.050
can’t even imagine. But if they’re interested
in finding life in the galaxy that’s just

00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:20.150
starting to get their technological legs under
them, radio waves are the way to go.

00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:24.619
Even primitive societies like ours use radio
waves, and they can travel for thousands of

00:07:24.619 --> 00:07:29.409
light years. Aliens could broadcast radio
waves across the galaxy, or target likely

00:07:29.409 --> 00:07:32.669
stars, or wait for us to make enough noise
— and for those waves to travel outward

00:07:32.669 --> 00:07:36.659
at the speed of light long enough to reach a
listening post — and then aim a transmitter at us.

00:07:36.659 --> 00:07:41.659
So the folks at SETI scan the skies at various
radio wavelengths, hoping to hear a signal.

00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:43.240
So far, nothing yet.

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:48.220
But they don’t despair. My friend, the astronomer
Seth Shostak, is a SETI scientist. He’s

00:07:48.229 --> 00:07:53.869
been doing this for years, and recently made
a bold, but logical claim. SETI tech is advancing

00:07:53.869 --> 00:07:57.919
rapidly, and they’re getting so good at
listening that they’ll be able to scan billions

00:07:57.919 --> 00:08:02.599
of stars. He predicts that, if anyone out
there is broadcasting, we’ll pick up the

00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:05.080
signal in the next 20 years.

00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:09.509
If we don’t, then, given the statistics,
it may very well mean that we’re alone in

00:08:09.509 --> 00:08:14.329
the galaxy. Or aliens might exist, but they’re
not broadcasting. Or, of course, that perhaps

00:08:14.329 --> 00:08:16.889
there’s another flaw in the chain in of
logic that we’ve missed.

00:08:16.889 --> 00:08:21.139
Either way – if they detect a signal, or
they don’t – the resulting conclusion

00:08:21.139 --> 00:08:27.039
is at least interesting, and at most terribly
profound. And it’s only our first, logical

00:08:27.039 --> 00:08:29.629
step in attempting to look for life Out There.

00:08:29.629 --> 00:08:34.550
I love astronomy. Maybe you’ve figured that
out over these past 46 episodes. I love it

00:08:34.550 --> 00:08:39.310
for so many reasons: The beauty, the grand
nature of it, the incredible vistas, the depth

00:08:39.310 --> 00:08:41.329
of the wonder and science of it.

00:08:41.329 --> 00:08:45.860
When I was little, the subtle profundity of
the questions related to astronomy were perhaps

00:08:45.870 --> 00:08:52.240
beyond me. But even then, the questions themselves
provoked a sense of wonder, of awe, so much

00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:55.149
so that even as a little kid, I could be stirred
by them.

00:08:55.149 --> 00:09:00.000
And now, as an adult, I grasp these questions
better. How did we come to be? What was it

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.740
like in those first few fractions of a second
after the Big Bang? Is ours the only cosmos

00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:09.600
out there, or are we part of a much larger
multiverse, riding along with other Universes

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:12.279
like bubbles in a sea of multidimensional
foam?

00:09:12.279 --> 00:09:15.219
What is the nature of stars? How do planets
form?

00:09:15.220 --> 00:09:17.500
Are there other Earths?
Are we alone?

00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:21.740
These are some of the grandest questions we
can ask, and in one shape or another have

00:09:21.750 --> 00:09:26.550
been asked by humans for thousands of years.
These are also questions that were once only

00:09:26.550 --> 00:09:31.560
in the purview of religion and philosophy,
but now we have observations to pursue them,

00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:33.740
evidence to back up our conditional answers.

00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:39.280
Because of astronomy, because of SCIENCE,
we now stand on the edge of understanding,

00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:44.200
our cleverness and brilliance having taken
us to the point where these questions, finally,

00:09:44.209 --> 00:09:46.480
have an answer we can almost touch.

00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:51.769
And the best part? As we investigate, as we
peek around the next corner, as we climb over

00:09:51.769 --> 00:09:57.319
the next hill, we find those answers… and
they reveal a host of more questions. The

00:09:57.319 --> 00:10:01.199
exploration never ends. There’s always
something else to discover.

00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:04.740
And that, THAT, is why I love astronomy.

00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:10.500
And so, it is not out of arrogance, not out
of false smugness, but out of pride and understanding

00:10:10.509 --> 00:10:15.589
hard-won by a legion of scientists who came
before me, who came before all of us, that

00:10:15.589 --> 00:10:18.420
I can now say: Let’s go explore the Universe.

00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:20.780
Thank you for watching.

00:10:20.780 --> 00:10:26.120
