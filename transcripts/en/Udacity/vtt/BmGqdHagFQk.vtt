00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.250
let's try another plotting exercise. This time, I want you to create

00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:06.450
a histogram of Facebook users based on their age. You should play

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.540
around with the bin width the breaks and the labels. The grader

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.490
will accept any answer here, but I want you to compare your

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:15.860
code and your observations of your histogram to those in the solution

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:19.940
video. After you create your histogram, think about what you notice and

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:22.420
remember that you can create a couple plots so don't just stick

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:25.450
to one. Figure out which pot reveals the most information to you.
