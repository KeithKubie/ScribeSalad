that is what we do is we always take

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:02.799
that is what we do is we always take
 

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:04.620
that is what we do is we always take
European history as the sum of all

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:04.630
European history as the sum of all
 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:07.190

things and somehow what happened again

2,500 years ago in ancient Greece is

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:09.940
2,500 years ago in ancient Greece is
 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:11.400
2,500 years ago in ancient Greece is
going to predict what's going to happen

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.410
going to predict what's going to happen
 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.990

in modern

in modern
 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.210
in modern
and I don't think that's the case at all

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220
and I don't think that's the case at all
 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.119
and I don't think that's the case at all
especially when we look at how East

00:02:18.119 --> 00:02:18.129
especially when we look at how East
 

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:21.000
especially when we look at how East
Asian history worked if we were to take

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010
Asian history worked if we were to take
 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:22.650
Asian history worked if we were to take
East Asia on its own terms

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.660
East Asia on its own terms
 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:24.660
East Asia on its own terms
instead of using Europe to explain Asia

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670
instead of using Europe to explain Asia
 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:26.160
instead of using Europe to explain Asia
why don't we look at East Asia and if we

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170
why don't we look at East Asia and if we
 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:27.210
why don't we look at East Asia and if we
took it on its own terms

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220
took it on its own terms
 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:30.180
took it on its own terms
one thing that we would find is that

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190
one thing that we would find is that
 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:33.199
one thing that we would find is that
first of all China's not really rising

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:33.209
first of all China's not really rising
 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:37.020
first of all China's not really rising
China has always been big sometimes it

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030
China has always been big sometimes it
 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:39.180
China has always been big sometimes it
goes into a period of decline and then

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190
goes into a period of decline and then
 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:41.070
goes into a period of decline and then
it comes back and this is more return

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080
it comes back and this is more return
 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:44.339
it comes back and this is more return
than a rise so it's not anything new to

00:02:44.339 --> 00:02:44.349
than a rise so it's not anything new to
 

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:47.880
than a rise so it's not anything new to
the countries in the region in many ways

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:47.890
the countries in the region in many ways
 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:51.449
the countries in the region in many ways
what happens is China's dominance

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:51.459
what happens is China's dominance
 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:54.630
what happens is China's dominance
China's massive size has been effective

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640
China's massive size has been effective
 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.970
China's massive size has been effective
life in East Asia for for literally

life in East Asia for for literally
 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.220
life in East Asia for for literally
centuries so this is nothing new so it's

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230
centuries so this is nothing new so it's
 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:01.319
centuries so this is nothing new so it's
not at all clear to me that we should

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:01.329
not at all clear to me that we should
 

00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:04.500
not at all clear to me that we should
view this as a rising power any more

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:04.510
view this as a rising power any more
 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:05.880
view this as a rising power any more
than we would views the United States as

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:05.890
than we would views the United States as
 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:09.089
than we would views the United States as
potentially a rising power the other

00:03:09.089 --> 00:03:09.099
potentially a rising power the other
 

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:11.720
potentially a rising power the other
problem is if we use East Asian history

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730
problem is if we use East Asian history
 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:14.100
problem is if we use East Asian history
one of the biggest lessons we would

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:14.110
one of the biggest lessons we would
 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:16.710
one of the biggest lessons we would
learn from East Asian history is that

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:16.720
learn from East Asian history is that
 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.520

the dangers that arise to countries in

the region are almost always internal
 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:26.160
the region are almost always internal
not external so even for rising and

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:26.170
not external so even for rising and
 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:29.520
not external so even for rising and
declining powers the fears or the

declining powers the fears or the
 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:31.379

threats there is a much domestic as they
 

00:03:31.389 --> 00:03:34.050
threats there is a much domestic as they
are internal so almost every single one

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:34.060
are internal so almost every single one

as the external issues and in fact one
 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:54.180
as the external issues and in fact one
thing we know is that China spends more

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:54.190
thing we know is that China spends more
 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:57.000
thing we know is that China spends more
on internal security than it does on

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:57.010
on internal security than it does on
 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:00.420
on internal security than it does on
external defense so even now it's not

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:00.430
external defense so even now it's not
 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:02.220
external defense so even now it's not
clear that China's ambitions are all

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:02.230
clear that China's ambitions are all
 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:04.229
clear that China's ambitions are all
directed outwards they're probably just

00:04:04.229 --> 00:04:04.239
directed outwards they're probably just
 

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:06.990
directed outwards they're probably just
as concerned about internal and if we

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:07.000
as concerned about internal and if we
 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.909
as concerned about internal and if we
look at the United States the lessons if

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:08.919
look at the United States the lessons if
 

00:04:08.919 --> 00:04:10.379
look at the United States the lessons if
we were to take the lessons from East

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:10.389
we were to take the lessons from East
 

00:04:10.389 --> 00:04:13.140
we were to take the lessons from East
Asian history and say wow instead of the

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:13.150
Asian history and say wow instead of the
 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:15.030
Asian history and say wow instead of the
inevitable war that Thucydides wrote

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:15.040
inevitable war that Thucydides wrote
 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:18.089
inevitable war that Thucydides wrote
about what if we were worried about the

00:04:18.089 --> 00:04:18.099
about what if we were worried about the
 

00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:19.620
about what if we were worried about the
lessons from East Asian history which is

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:19.630
lessons from East Asian history which is
 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:21.950
lessons from East Asian history which is
the Japanese dying to know the Japanese

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:21.960
the Japanese dying to know the Japanese
 

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:24.210
the Japanese dying to know the Japanese
Shogun's all fell from internal

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:24.220
Shogun's all fell from internal
 

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:25.620
Shogun's all fell from internal
rebellion

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:25.630
rebellion
 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:27.960
rebellion
in Vietnamese dynasties almost all fell

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:27.970
in Vietnamese dynasties almost all fell
 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:30.960
in Vietnamese dynasties almost all fell
from internal rebellion as well so what

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:30.970
from internal rebellion as well so what
 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:32.390
from internal rebellion as well so what
would the lesson for today be

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:32.400
would the lesson for today be
 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:35.100
would the lesson for today be
self-inflicted wounds in both the United

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:35.110
self-inflicted wounds in both the United
 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:37.620
self-inflicted wounds in both the United
States and China may matter more than

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:37.630
States and China may matter more than
 

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:40.110
States and China may matter more than
any titanic struggle between them in

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:40.120
any titanic struggle between them in
 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:42.480
any titanic struggle between them in
fact if I was a look at the United

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:42.490
fact if I was a look at the United
 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:44.490
fact if I was a look at the United
States today the challenges that we face

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:44.500
States today the challenges that we face
 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:47.400
States today the challenges that we face
are far more internal than they are from

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:47.410
are far more internal than they are from
 

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:48.810
are far more internal than they are from
China yes

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:48.820
China yes
 

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:50.490
China yes
China and the United States haven't

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:50.500
China and the United States haven't
 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:53.130
China and the United States haven't
worked out a totally stable equilibrium

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:53.140
worked out a totally stable equilibrium
 

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:55.440
worked out a totally stable equilibrium
we have things at the margins we have to

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:55.450
we have things at the margins we have to
 

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:57.990
we have things at the margins we have to
deal with maybe some uninhabited rocks

00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:58.000
deal with maybe some uninhabited rocks
 

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.570
deal with maybe some uninhabited rocks
in the South China Seas maybe some trade

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:00.580
in the South China Seas maybe some trade
 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:03.270
in the South China Seas maybe some trade
disputes but those are not things that

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:03.280
disputes but those are not things that
 

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:05.160
disputes but those are not things that
are gonna lead to Titanic struggle for

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:05.170
are gonna lead to Titanic struggle for
 

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:08.370
are gonna lead to Titanic struggle for
global dominance and I don't see any bet

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:08.380
global dominance and I don't see any bet
 

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:10.010
global dominance and I don't see any bet
war between China and the United States

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:10.020
war between China and the United States
 

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:13.890
war between China and the United States
along those lines but I do see huge

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:13.900
along those lines but I do see huge
 

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:16.530
along those lines but I do see huge
issues in China itself from internal

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:16.540
issues in China itself from internal
 

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:18.270
issues in China itself from internal
security to environmental issues to a

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:18.280
security to environmental issues to a
 

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:21.570
security to environmental issues to a
rapidly aging population and frankly I

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:21.580
rapidly aging population and frankly I
 

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:23.280
rapidly aging population and frankly I
see just as many issues in the United

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:23.290
see just as many issues in the United
 

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:25.980
see just as many issues in the United
States as well if we look at the threats

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:25.990
States as well if we look at the threats
 

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:28.200
States as well if we look at the threats
that are facing United States it's a

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:28.210
that are facing United States it's a
 

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:32.180
that are facing United States it's a
deeply divided country it's a massively

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:32.190
deeply divided country it's a massively
 

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:35.880
deeply divided country it's a massively
under invested infrastructure in whether

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:35.890
under invested infrastructure in whether
 

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:38.760
under invested infrastructure in whether
it's our transportation or education and

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:38.770
it's our transportation or education and
 

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:41.670
it's our transportation or education and
in many ways we have the the issues we

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:41.680
in many ways we have the the issues we
 

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:43.260
in many ways we have the the issues we
face today are much more internal than

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:43.270
face today are much more internal than
 

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:47.310
face today are much more internal than
external so I was to say what do I think

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:47.320
external so I was to say what do I think
 

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:50.280
external so I was to say what do I think
about the the future of US China I'd say

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:50.290
about the the future of US China I'd say
 

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:52.110
about the the future of US China I'd say
it's much more about sort of scoring an

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:52.120
it's much more about sort of scoring an
 

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:55.280
it's much more about sort of scoring an
own goal than it is about any kind of

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:55.290
own goal than it is about any kind of
 

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:57.420
own goal than it is about any kind of
massive battle between the two countries

00:05:57.420 --> 00:05:57.430
massive battle between the two countries
 

00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:59.550
massive battle between the two countries
Europe isn't the measure of all things

00:05:59.550 --> 00:05:59.560
Europe isn't the measure of all things
 

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:01.830
Europe isn't the measure of all things
and if there's different examples or

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:01.840
and if there's different examples or
 

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:03.450
and if there's different examples or
different experiences in East Asia and

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:03.460
different experiences in East Asia and
 

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:05.100
different experiences in East Asia and
if they have different implications for

if they have different implications for
 

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:07.230
if they have different implications for
the present of the future then we ought

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:07.240
the present of the future then we ought
 

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:09.870
the present of the future then we ought
to take it seriously and in many ways

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:09.880
to take it seriously and in many ways
 

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:12.930
to take it seriously and in many ways
that's what I think that uh people like

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:12.940
that's what I think that uh people like
 

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:15.930
that's what I think that uh people like
myself that's our task right our task is

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:15.940
myself that's our task right our task is
 

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:19.530
myself that's our task right our task is
to try and show understand East Asian

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:19.540
to try and show understand East Asian
 

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:21.810
to try and show understand East Asian
history without making a cartoon out of

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:21.820
history without making a cartoon out of
 

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:23.370
history without making a cartoon out of
it without making a caricature out of it

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:23.380
it without making a caricature out of it
 

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:25.170
it without making a caricature out of it
but taking it seriously

00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:25.180
but taking it seriously
 

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:27.240
but taking it seriously
and if some things are the same then

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:27.250
and if some things are the same then
 

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:29.040
and if some things are the same then
fine and if some things are different

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:29.050
fine and if some things are different
 

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:31.020
fine and if some things are different
than we need to point them out you know

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:31.030
than we need to point them out you know
 

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:33.180
than we need to point them out you know
and this goes back to really an

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:33.190
and this goes back to really an
 

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:35.340
and this goes back to really an
important theoretical point or a point

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:35.350
important theoretical point or a point
 

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:38.070
important theoretical point or a point
about how we think about the world which

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:38.080
about how we think about the world which
 

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:38.999
about how we think about the world which
is that in many

00:06:38.999 --> 00:06:39.009
is that in many
 

00:06:39.009 --> 00:06:41.489
is that in many
cases local knowledge about situations

00:06:41.489 --> 00:06:41.499
cases local knowledge about situations
 

00:06:41.499 --> 00:06:43.140
cases local knowledge about situations
this is important as any kind of broad

00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:43.150
this is important as any kind of broad
 

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:44.670
this is important as any kind of broad
theory about the way of the world

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:44.680
theory about the way of the world
 

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:46.920
theory about the way of the world
inevitably works and we want to know

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:46.930
inevitably works and we want to know
 

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:48.540
inevitably works and we want to know
both we want have some good theories but

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:48.550
both we want have some good theories but
 

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:50.399
both we want have some good theories but
we also really want to make sure that

00:06:50.399 --> 00:06:50.409
we also really want to make sure that
 

00:06:50.409 --> 00:06:52.109
we also really want to make sure that
those theories apply to the region and

00:06:52.109 --> 00:06:52.119
those theories apply to the region and
 

00:06:52.119 --> 00:06:53.760
those theories apply to the region and
only with having that kind of knowledge

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:53.770
only with having that kind of knowledge
 

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:56.909
only with having that kind of knowledge
can you really take East Asia on its own

00:06:56.909 --> 00:06:56.919
can you really take East Asia on its own
 

00:06:56.919 --> 00:06:58.390
can you really take East Asia on its own
on its own terms

00:06:58.390 --> 00:06:58.400
on its own terms
 

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:06.370
