pavilion an actual usable space within
 

00:22:06.250 --> 00:22:11.970
pavilion an actual usable space within
this area so this was about a 2,000 or

00:22:11.970 --> 00:22:11.980
this area so this was about a 2,000 or
 

00:22:11.980 --> 00:22:14.940
this area so this was about a 2,000 or
about 1,000 square foot roof structure

this this event was three days long so
 

00:23:21.519 --> 00:23:23.249
this this event was three days long so
you know we didn't want to just make

00:23:23.249 --> 00:23:23.259
you know we didn't want to just make
 

00:23:23.259 --> 00:23:25.769
you know we didn't want to just make
something that would only live for this

00:23:25.769 --> 00:23:25.779
something that would only live for this
 

00:23:25.779 --> 00:23:27.810
something that would only live for this
three day long event so we really had in

00:23:27.810 --> 00:23:27.820
three day long event so we really had in
 

00:23:27.820 --> 00:23:30.570
three day long event so we really had in
mind that the desire to create a

00:23:30.570 --> 00:23:30.580
mind that the desire to create a
 

00:23:30.580 --> 00:23:33.029
mind that the desire to create a
traveling pavilion so the this main

00:23:33.029 --> 00:23:33.039
traveling pavilion so the this main
 

00:23:33.039 --> 00:23:35.549
traveling pavilion so the this main
theme was deployability especially in

00:23:35.549 --> 00:23:35.559
theme was deployability especially in
 

00:23:35.559 --> 00:23:38.879
theme was deployability especially in
the second and third iterations of this

00:23:38.879 --> 00:23:38.889
the second and third iterations of this
 

00:23:38.889 --> 00:23:43.230
the second and third iterations of this
project so part of this was mobility

00:23:43.230 --> 00:23:43.240
project so part of this was mobility
 

00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:45.840
project so part of this was mobility
being able to transport the pavilion

00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:45.850
being able to transport the pavilion
 

00:23:45.850 --> 00:23:48.840
being able to transport the pavilion
quickly and easily flat packing it and

00:23:48.840 --> 00:23:48.850
quickly and easily flat packing it and
 

00:23:48.850 --> 00:23:52.830
quickly and easily flat packing it and
then you know really have this thing

00:23:52.830 --> 00:23:52.840
then you know really have this thing
 

00:23:52.840 --> 00:23:55.980
then you know really have this thing
have multiple lives so what you see here

00:23:55.980 --> 00:23:55.990
have multiple lives so what you see here
 

00:23:55.990 --> 00:24:00.299
have multiple lives so what you see here
is the third pavilion which in its

00:24:00.299 --> 00:24:00.309
is the third pavilion which in its
 

00:24:00.309 --> 00:24:02.940
is the third pavilion which in its
largest manifestation was about 3,000

00:24:02.940 --> 00:24:02.950
largest manifestation was about 3,000
 

00:24:02.950 --> 00:24:05.279
largest manifestation was about 3,000
square feet and it's all flat packed

00:24:05.279 --> 00:24:05.289
square feet and it's all flat packed
 

00:24:05.289 --> 00:24:05.850
square feet and it's all flat packed
into the

00:24:05.850 --> 00:24:05.860
into the
 

00:24:05.860 --> 00:24:09.750
into the
one 24 foot truck on its way to one of

00:24:09.750 --> 00:24:09.760
one 24 foot truck on its way to one of
 

00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:14.750
one 24 foot truck on its way to one of
the events and the other aspect of this

00:24:14.750 --> 00:24:14.760
the events and the other aspect of this
 

00:24:14.760 --> 00:24:19.520
the events and the other aspect of this
idea of deployability was a

00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:19.530
idea of deployability was a
 

00:24:19.530 --> 00:24:22.560
idea of deployability was a
reconfigurable ax t so we didn't want to

00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:22.570
reconfigurable ax t so we didn't want to
 

00:24:22.570 --> 00:24:24.720
reconfigurable ax t so we didn't want to
just move it from place to place but the

00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:24.730
just move it from place to place but the
 

00:24:24.730 --> 00:24:26.789
just move it from place to place but the
real idea was can we build it

00:24:26.789 --> 00:24:26.799
real idea was can we build it
 

00:24:26.799 --> 00:24:29.220
real idea was can we build it
differently each time so depending on

00:24:29.220 --> 00:24:29.230
differently each time so depending on
 

00:24:29.230 --> 00:24:32.880
differently each time so depending on
the needs of each venue and the site

00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:32.890

conditions and how the people might flow
 

00:24:35.830 --> 00:24:38.909
conditions and how the people might flow
through the space we want it to really

00:24:38.909 --> 00:24:38.919
through the space we want it to really
 

00:24:38.919 --> 00:24:44.039
through the space we want it to really
be able to transform this structure so

00:24:44.039 --> 00:24:44.049
be able to transform this structure so
 

00:24:44.049 --> 00:24:47.990
be able to transform this structure so
just to go through these four right here

00:24:47.990 --> 00:24:48.000
just to go through these four right here
 

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:51.480
just to go through these four right here
are all solar pavilion two so we

00:24:51.480 --> 00:24:51.490
are all solar pavilion two so we
 

00:24:51.490 --> 00:24:53.850
are all solar pavilion two so we
basically made these diagrams of each of

00:24:53.850 --> 00:24:53.860
basically made these diagrams of each of
 

00:24:53.860 --> 00:24:56.130
basically made these diagrams of each of
the four manifestations of it which I'll

00:24:56.130 --> 00:24:56.140
the four manifestations of it which I'll
 

00:24:56.140 --> 00:24:59.760
the four manifestations of it which I'll
just show you in some more detail so

00:24:59.760 --> 00:24:59.770
just show you in some more detail so
 

00:24:59.770 --> 00:25:01.380
just show you in some more detail so
this was the first one at city hall with

00:25:01.380 --> 00:25:01.390
this was the first one at city hall with
 

00:25:01.390 --> 00:25:03.480
this was the first one at city hall with
the bar in the middle and then various

00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:03.490
the bar in the middle and then various
 

00:25:03.490 --> 00:25:10.310
the bar in the middle and then various
other programs and then the second

00:25:10.310 --> 00:25:10.320
other programs and then the second
 

00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:12.299
other programs and then the second
manifestation was at the dumbo art

00:25:12.299 --> 00:25:12.309
manifestation was at the dumbo art
 

00:25:12.309 --> 00:25:15.780
manifestation was at the dumbo art
festival where the pavilion took on is

00:25:15.780 --> 00:25:15.790
festival where the pavilion took on is
 

00:25:15.790 --> 00:25:19.020
festival where the pavilion took on is
very linear form I'm it was sort of

00:25:19.020 --> 00:25:19.030
very linear form I'm it was sort of
 

00:25:19.030 --> 00:25:22.710
very linear form I'm it was sort of
functioned like a shaded arcade along

00:25:22.710 --> 00:25:22.720
functioned like a shaded arcade along
 

00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:27.570
functioned like a shaded arcade along
this pathway that led from the street to

00:25:27.570 --> 00:25:27.580
this pathway that led from the street to
 

00:25:27.580 --> 00:25:29.820

over to the right so it was this like

00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:32.530
over to the right so it was this like
 

00:25:32.530 --> 00:25:35.220
over to the right so it was this like
entry passage leading to the park where

00:25:35.220 --> 00:25:35.230
entry passage leading to the park where
 

00:25:35.230 --> 00:25:37.820
entry passage leading to the park where
there was a series of art installations

00:25:37.820 --> 00:25:37.830
there was a series of art installations
 

00:25:37.830 --> 00:25:43.260
there was a series of art installations
and then a few months after that we put

00:25:43.260 --> 00:25:43.270
and then a few months after that we put
 

00:25:43.270 --> 00:25:45.000
and then a few months after that we put
everything back on the truck and drove

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:45.010
everything back on the truck and drove
 

00:25:45.010 --> 00:25:49.530
everything back on the truck and drove
it down to Miami for the art fair and

00:25:49.530 --> 00:25:49.540
it down to Miami for the art fair and
 

00:25:49.540 --> 00:25:52.320
it down to Miami for the art fair and
the pavilion we built it there in front

00:25:52.320 --> 00:25:52.330
the pavilion we built it there in front
 

00:25:52.330 --> 00:25:56.960
the pavilion we built it there in front
of the scope art fair as a sort of entry

00:25:56.960 --> 00:25:56.970
of the scope art fair as a sort of entry
 

00:25:56.970 --> 00:26:00.840

this white tent behind the structure and
 

00:26:04.840 --> 00:26:07.919
this white tent behind the structure and
our pavilion served as a filter to guide

00:26:07.919 --> 00:26:07.929
our pavilion served as a filter to guide
 

00:26:07.929 --> 00:26:11.100
our pavilion served as a filter to guide
the visitors into that space there was

00:26:11.100 --> 00:26:11.110
the visitors into that space there was
 

00:26:11.110 --> 00:26:15.570
the visitors into that space there was
three passages and this like tunnel

00:26:15.570 --> 00:26:15.580
three passages and this like tunnel
 

00:26:15.580 --> 00:26:17.100
three passages and this like tunnel
space to the right which was for the

00:26:17.100 --> 00:26:17.110
space to the right which was for the
 

00:26:17.110 --> 00:26:18.510

one to the left for the VIP and then

00:26:21.750 --> 00:26:21.760
one to the left for the VIP and then
 

00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:23.640
one to the left for the VIP and then
there was a central passage that was the

00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:23.650
there was a central passage that was the
 

00:26:23.650 --> 00:26:29.100
there was a central passage that was the
exit for out of the tent and then

00:26:29.100 --> 00:26:29.110
exit for out of the tent and then
 

00:26:29.110 --> 00:26:33.510
exit for out of the tent and then
finally we had the pavilion inn in a

00:26:33.510 --> 00:26:33.520
finally we had the pavilion inn in a
 

00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:36.600
finally we had the pavilion inn in a
container for a year and we took it out

00:26:36.600 --> 00:26:36.610
container for a year and we took it out
 

00:26:36.610 --> 00:26:39.150
container for a year and we took it out
one last time a year later to take you

00:26:39.150 --> 00:26:39.160
one last time a year later to take you
 

00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:42.300
one last time a year later to take you
to the all points west music festival in

00:26:42.300 --> 00:26:42.310
to the all points west music festival in
 

00:26:42.310 --> 00:26:46.110
to the all points west music festival in
Liberty State Park New Jersey and here

00:26:46.110 --> 00:26:46.120
Liberty State Park New Jersey and here
 

00:26:46.120 --> 00:26:49.200
Liberty State Park New Jersey and here
it was kind of this rest pavilion it was

00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:49.210
it was kind of this rest pavilion it was
 

00:26:49.210 --> 00:26:52.590
it was kind of this rest pavilion it was
a bit in a in a large field away from

00:26:52.590 --> 00:26:52.600
a bit in a in a large field away from
 

00:26:52.600 --> 00:26:55.380
a bit in a in a large field away from
the two main music venues I mean we made

00:26:55.380 --> 00:26:55.390
the two main music venues I mean we made
 

00:26:55.390 --> 00:26:58.980
the two main music venues I mean we made
it to have these two views toward the

00:26:58.980 --> 00:26:58.990
it to have these two views toward the
 

00:26:58.990 --> 00:27:01.590
it to have these two views toward the
two stages and then a third year looking

00:27:01.590 --> 00:27:01.600
two stages and then a third year looking
 

00:27:01.600 --> 00:27:04.350
two stages and then a third year looking
out into into the Hudson River

00:27:04.350 --> 00:27:04.360
out into into the Hudson River
 

00:27:04.360 --> 00:27:12.660
out into into the Hudson River
waterfront so one thing to mention with

00:27:12.660 --> 00:27:12.670
waterfront so one thing to mention with
 

00:27:12.670 --> 00:27:16.080
waterfront so one thing to mention with
these diagrams these were all produced

00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:16.090
these diagrams these were all produced
 

00:27:16.090 --> 00:27:19.620
these diagrams these were all produced
after the event they were sort of like a

00:27:19.620 --> 00:27:19.630
after the event they were sort of like a
 

00:27:19.630 --> 00:27:22.620
after the event they were sort of like a
way to document what had developed

00:27:22.620 --> 00:27:22.630
way to document what had developed
 

00:27:22.630 --> 00:27:26.490
way to document what had developed
during the installation prior to

00:27:26.490 --> 00:27:26.500
during the installation prior to
 

00:27:26.500 --> 00:27:28.560
during the installation prior to
arriving at a site we would we never

00:27:28.560 --> 00:27:28.570
arriving at a site we would we never
 

00:27:28.570 --> 00:27:30.980
arriving at a site we would we never
really defined what the form would be

00:27:30.980 --> 00:27:30.990
really defined what the form would be
 

00:27:30.990 --> 00:27:34.380
really defined what the form would be
the project was really about developing

00:27:34.380 --> 00:27:34.390
the project was really about developing
 

00:27:34.390 --> 00:27:37.980
the project was really about developing
certain assembly logics in each of the

00:27:37.980 --> 00:27:37.990
certain assembly logics in each of the
 

00:27:37.990 --> 00:27:40.950
certain assembly logics in each of the
three pavilions there's certain rule

00:27:40.950 --> 00:27:40.960
three pavilions there's certain rule
 

00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:42.930
three pavilions there's certain rule
sets that we develop for how parts go

00:27:42.930 --> 00:27:42.940
sets that we develop for how parts go
 

00:27:42.940 --> 00:27:45.960
sets that we develop for how parts go
together so the way that what these

00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:45.970
together so the way that what these
 

00:27:45.970 --> 00:27:49.320
together so the way that what these
drawings are serving to show is this

00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:49.330
drawings are serving to show is this
 

00:27:49.330 --> 00:27:51.420
drawings are serving to show is this
notation of different types of line

00:27:51.420 --> 00:27:51.430
notation of different types of line
 

00:27:51.430 --> 00:27:54.150
notation of different types of line
correspond to different hierarchy of

00:27:54.150 --> 00:27:54.160
correspond to different hierarchy of
 

00:27:54.160 --> 00:27:56.640
correspond to different hierarchy of
members and each one having different

00:27:56.640 --> 00:27:56.650
members and each one having different
 

00:27:56.650 --> 00:27:58.530
members and each one having different
characteristics that determine where in

00:27:58.530 --> 00:27:58.540
characteristics that determine where in
 

00:27:58.540 --> 00:28:02.100
characteristics that determine where in
the structure they go so when we derive

00:28:02.100 --> 00:28:02.110
the structure they go so when we derive
 

00:28:02.110 --> 00:28:04.080
the structure they go so when we derive
on a site we'd really you know we get

00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:04.090
on a site we'd really you know we get
 

00:28:04.090 --> 00:28:06.150
on a site we'd really you know we get
there with a group of people a truck

00:28:06.150 --> 00:28:06.160
there with a group of people a truck
 

00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:09.960
there with a group of people a truck
full of parts and we kind of quickly

00:28:09.960 --> 00:28:09.970
full of parts and we kind of quickly
 

00:28:09.970 --> 00:28:11.970
full of parts and we kind of quickly
sketch out what we might want to do with

00:28:11.970 --> 00:28:11.980
sketch out what we might want to do with
 

00:28:11.980 --> 00:28:14.160
sketch out what we might want to do with
the structure there have some idea about

00:28:14.160 --> 00:28:14.170
the structure there have some idea about
 

00:28:14.170 --> 00:28:17.340
the structure there have some idea about
how people would interact with it and

00:28:17.340 --> 00:28:17.350
how people would interact with it and
 

00:28:17.350 --> 00:28:18.920
how people would interact with it and
you know whether there were other

00:28:18.920 --> 00:28:18.930
you know whether there were other
 

00:28:18.930 --> 00:28:21.110
you know whether there were other
functions that the pavilion would serve

00:28:21.110 --> 00:28:21.120
functions that the pavilion would serve
 

00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:24.030
functions that the pavilion would serve
so we'd have this kind of really quick

00:28:24.030 --> 00:28:24.040
so we'd have this kind of really quick
 

00:28:24.040 --> 00:28:29.160
so we'd have this kind of really quick
sketch of of some sort of direction and

00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:29.170
sketch of of some sort of direction and
 

00:28:29.170 --> 00:28:31.580
sketch of of some sort of direction and
then we basically begin this

00:28:31.580 --> 00:28:31.590
then we basically begin this
 

00:28:31.590 --> 00:28:34.720
then we basically begin this
this participatory event of the

00:28:34.720 --> 00:28:34.730
this participatory event of the
 

00:28:34.730 --> 00:28:39.409
this participatory event of the
installation and in many cases we'd have

00:28:39.409 --> 00:28:39.419
installation and in many cases we'd have
 

00:28:39.419 --> 00:28:42.399
installation and in many cases we'd have
a different group of volunteers

00:28:42.399 --> 00:28:42.409
a different group of volunteers
 

00:28:42.409 --> 00:28:46.070
a different group of volunteers
assisting us with this so we'd really

00:28:46.070 --> 00:28:46.080
assisting us with this so we'd really
 

00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:47.899
assisting us with this so we'd really
just teach them those those basic

00:28:47.899 --> 00:28:47.909
just teach them those those basic
 

00:28:47.909 --> 00:28:51.350
just teach them those those basic
assembly rules and then this sort of

00:28:51.350 --> 00:28:51.360
assembly rules and then this sort of
 

00:28:51.360 --> 00:28:53.779
assembly rules and then this sort of
freeform growth process would proceed

00:28:53.779 --> 00:28:53.789
freeform growth process would proceed
 

00:28:53.789 --> 00:28:56.870
freeform growth process would proceed
where we're really just guiding guiding

00:28:56.870 --> 00:28:56.880
where we're really just guiding guiding
 

00:28:56.880 --> 00:29:00.500
where we're really just guiding guiding
this development you know changing it

00:29:00.500 --> 00:29:00.510
this development you know changing it
 

00:29:00.510 --> 00:29:02.860
this development you know changing it
modifying it making it wider or narrower

00:29:02.860 --> 00:29:02.870
modifying it making it wider or narrower
 

00:29:02.870 --> 00:29:05.630
modifying it making it wider or narrower
adding a passage here there it was

00:29:05.630 --> 00:29:05.640
adding a passage here there it was
 

00:29:05.640 --> 00:29:08.899
adding a passage here there it was
really this like fluid freeform kind of

00:29:08.899 --> 00:29:08.909
really this like fluid freeform kind of
 

00:29:08.909 --> 00:29:13.220
really this like fluid freeform kind of
construction so no one part really has

00:29:13.220 --> 00:29:13.230
construction so no one part really has
 

00:29:13.230 --> 00:29:15.260
construction so no one part really has
any position it's it's you know it's

00:29:15.260 --> 00:29:15.270
any position it's it's you know it's
 

00:29:15.270 --> 00:29:17.720
any position it's it's you know it's
much more of this almost like this

00:29:17.720 --> 00:29:17.730
much more of this almost like this
 

00:29:17.730 --> 00:29:20.149
much more of this almost like this
bottom-up paradigm of growth where we're

00:29:20.149 --> 00:29:20.159
bottom-up paradigm of growth where we're
 

00:29:20.159 --> 00:29:21.769
bottom-up paradigm of growth where we're
not really following a plan that's

00:29:21.769 --> 00:29:21.779
not really following a plan that's
 

00:29:21.779 --> 00:29:24.950
not really following a plan that's
predefined but it's more of like this

00:29:24.950 --> 00:29:24.960
predefined but it's more of like this
 

00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:26.600
predefined but it's more of like this
open-ended process that could

00:29:26.600 --> 00:29:26.610
open-ended process that could
 

00:29:26.610 --> 00:29:38.600
open-ended process that could
potentially continue endlessly

00:29:38.600 --> 00:29:38.610
 
 

00:29:38.610 --> 00:29:41.690
 
so this is the first manifestation of

00:29:41.690 --> 00:29:41.700
so this is the first manifestation of
 

00:29:41.700 --> 00:29:49.940
so this is the first manifestation of
pavilion 3 at the city soul festival and

00:29:49.940 --> 00:29:49.950
pavilion 3 at the city soul festival and
 

00:29:49.950 --> 00:29:56.600
pavilion 3 at the city soul festival and
some images of it complete the basic

00:29:56.600 --> 00:29:56.610
some images of it complete the basic
 

00:29:56.610 --> 00:30:01.460
some images of it complete the basic
system here is essentially these lattice

00:30:01.460 --> 00:30:01.470
system here is essentially these lattice
 

00:30:01.470 --> 00:30:04.760
system here is essentially these lattice
like plywood strips that are woven in a

00:30:04.760 --> 00:30:04.770
like plywood strips that are woven in a
 

00:30:04.770 --> 00:30:08.690
like plywood strips that are woven in a
certain pattern and they can pack they

00:30:08.690 --> 00:30:08.700
certain pattern and they can pack they
 

00:30:08.700 --> 00:30:10.250
certain pattern and they can pack they
can flat pack and they're pinned

00:30:10.250 --> 00:30:10.260
can flat pack and they're pinned
 

00:30:10.260 --> 00:30:12.169
can flat pack and they're pinned
together with these aluminum connectors

00:30:12.169 --> 00:30:12.179
together with these aluminum connectors
 

00:30:12.179 --> 00:30:15.830
together with these aluminum connectors
and then on-site with these other linear

00:30:15.830 --> 00:30:15.840
and then on-site with these other linear
 

00:30:15.840 --> 00:30:18.200
and then on-site with these other linear
struts that are basically expanded out

00:30:18.200 --> 00:30:18.210
struts that are basically expanded out
 

00:30:18.210 --> 00:30:20.870
struts that are basically expanded out
so they can travel flat and then they

00:30:20.870 --> 00:30:20.880
so they can travel flat and then they
 

00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:25.659
so they can travel flat and then they
just get pulled out to create volume and

00:30:25.659 --> 00:30:25.669
just get pulled out to create volume and
 

00:30:25.669 --> 00:30:29.480
just get pulled out to create volume and
then there's a secondary system of vinyl

00:30:29.480 --> 00:30:29.490
then there's a secondary system of vinyl
 

00:30:29.490 --> 00:30:31.070
then there's a secondary system of vinyl
membranes that provided that were

00:30:31.070 --> 00:30:31.080
membranes that provided that were
 

00:30:31.080 --> 00:30:33.820
membranes that provided that were
suspended beneath the plywood armature

00:30:33.820 --> 00:30:33.830
suspended beneath the plywood armature
 

00:30:33.830 --> 00:30:42.409
suspended beneath the plywood armature
producing shade now this idea of a

00:30:42.409 --> 00:30:42.419
producing shade now this idea of a
 

00:30:42.419 --> 00:30:44.419
producing shade now this idea of a
system of assembly that's driving the

00:30:44.419 --> 00:30:44.429
system of assembly that's driving the
 

00:30:44.429 --> 00:30:50.870
system of assembly that's driving the
form is was really defined through an

00:30:50.870 --> 00:30:50.880
form is was really defined through an
 

00:30:50.880 --> 00:30:53.630
form is was really defined through an
articulation of the details we'd have

00:30:53.630 --> 00:30:53.640
articulation of the details we'd have
 

00:30:53.640 --> 00:30:59.560
articulation of the details we'd have
some basic idea about a structural a

00:30:59.560 --> 00:30:59.570
some basic idea about a structural a
 

00:30:59.570 --> 00:31:04.990
some basic idea about a structural a
structural system that we'd basically

00:31:04.990 --> 00:31:05.000
structural system that we'd basically
 

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:08.120
structural system that we'd basically
resolve it in through really defining

00:31:08.120 --> 00:31:08.130
resolve it in through really defining
 

00:31:08.130 --> 00:31:10.310
resolve it in through really defining
how the connections would work we would

00:31:10.310 --> 00:31:10.320
how the connections would work we would
 

00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:13.780
how the connections would work we would
develop the degree of flexibility and

00:31:13.780 --> 00:31:13.790
develop the degree of flexibility and
 

00:31:13.790 --> 00:31:16.070
develop the degree of flexibility and
while also achieving a structural

00:31:16.070 --> 00:31:16.080
while also achieving a structural
 

00:31:16.080 --> 00:31:19.010
while also achieving a structural
strength that would be required so

00:31:19.010 --> 00:31:19.020
strength that would be required so
 

00:31:19.020 --> 00:31:21.919
strength that would be required so
basically the on the this is showing the

00:31:21.919 --> 00:31:21.929
basically the on the this is showing the
 

00:31:21.929 --> 00:31:25.610
basically the on the this is showing the
second pavilion and the basic system

00:31:25.610 --> 00:31:25.620
second pavilion and the basic system
 

00:31:25.620 --> 00:31:29.840
second pavilion and the basic system
here on the bottom right is a consists

00:31:29.840 --> 00:31:29.850
here on the bottom right is a consists
 

00:31:29.850 --> 00:31:31.610
here on the bottom right is a consists
of these series of plywood strips that

00:31:31.610 --> 00:31:31.620
of these series of plywood strips that
 

00:31:31.620 --> 00:31:33.890
of these series of plywood strips that
have an interlocking edge detail and

00:31:33.890 --> 00:31:33.900
have an interlocking edge detail and
 

00:31:33.900 --> 00:31:36.890
have an interlocking edge detail and
they basically notch into each other and

00:31:36.890 --> 00:31:36.900
they basically notch into each other and
 

00:31:36.900 --> 00:31:40.130
they basically notch into each other and
are held together with zip ties and if

00:31:40.130 --> 00:31:40.140
are held together with zip ties and if
 

00:31:40.140 --> 00:31:43.220
are held together with zip ties and if
you remove certain key joints the this

00:31:43.220 --> 00:31:43.230
you remove certain key joints the this
 

00:31:43.230 --> 00:31:45.919
you remove certain key joints the this
whole unit can basically collapse into a

00:31:45.919 --> 00:31:45.929
whole unit can basically collapse into a
 

00:31:45.929 --> 00:31:49.190
whole unit can basically collapse into a
flat bundle so likewise similar to the

00:31:49.190 --> 00:31:49.200
flat bundle so likewise similar to the
 

00:31:49.200 --> 00:31:51.360
flat bundle so likewise similar to the
pavilion three

00:31:51.360 --> 00:31:51.370
pavilion three
 

00:31:51.370 --> 00:31:53.610
pavilion three
Travel flat and then you expand it out

00:31:53.610 --> 00:31:53.620
Travel flat and then you expand it out
 

00:31:53.620 --> 00:31:56.070
Travel flat and then you expand it out
put these key connections back in and

00:31:56.070 --> 00:31:56.080
put these key connections back in and
 

00:31:56.080 --> 00:31:59.070
put these key connections back in and
add additional members and it becomes a

00:31:59.070 --> 00:31:59.080
add additional members and it becomes a
 

00:31:59.080 --> 00:32:02.240
add additional members and it becomes a
stable form and so once we had this

00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:02.250
stable form and so once we had this
 

00:32:02.250 --> 00:32:06.390
stable form and so once we had this
basic idea we would proceed through kind

00:32:06.390 --> 00:32:06.400
basic idea we would proceed through kind
 

00:32:06.400 --> 00:32:15.570
basic idea we would proceed through kind
of evolving this joint which both gave

00:32:15.570 --> 00:32:15.580
of evolving this joint which both gave
 

00:32:15.580 --> 00:32:18.090
of evolving this joint which both gave
us a flexibility and structural strength

00:32:18.090 --> 00:32:18.100
us a flexibility and structural strength
 

00:32:18.100 --> 00:32:20.340
us a flexibility and structural strength
and we it was really we were trying to

00:32:20.340 --> 00:32:20.350
and we it was really we were trying to
 

00:32:20.350 --> 00:32:29.910
and we it was really we were trying to
fine-tune this the geometry of this so

00:32:29.910 --> 00:32:29.920
fine-tune this the geometry of this so
 

00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:31.560
fine-tune this the geometry of this so
that it you know it would serve our

00:32:31.560 --> 00:32:31.570
that it you know it would serve our
 

00:32:31.570 --> 00:32:38.880
that it you know it would serve our
needs and they have this um it became

00:32:38.880 --> 00:32:38.890
needs and they have this um it became
 

00:32:38.890 --> 00:32:40.740
needs and they have this um it became
this zigzagging form which is really a

00:32:40.740 --> 00:32:40.750
this zigzagging form which is really a
 

00:32:40.750 --> 00:32:43.530
this zigzagging form which is really a
result of certain practical constraints

00:32:43.530 --> 00:32:43.540
result of certain practical constraints
 

00:32:43.540 --> 00:32:47.730
result of certain practical constraints
of manufacturing so it's basically a

00:32:47.730 --> 00:32:47.740
of manufacturing so it's basically a
 

00:32:47.740 --> 00:32:51.030
of manufacturing so it's basically a
single cut is producing two sides of two

00:32:51.030 --> 00:32:51.040
single cut is producing two sides of two
 

00:32:51.040 --> 00:32:53.520
single cut is producing two sides of two
parts and essentially there was no waste

00:32:53.520 --> 00:32:53.530
parts and essentially there was no waste
 

00:32:53.530 --> 00:32:55.770
parts and essentially there was no waste
you know every part of the sheet that's

00:32:55.770 --> 00:32:55.780
you know every part of the sheet that's
 

00:32:55.780 --> 00:32:58.820
you know every part of the sheet that's
left over has this joint and it is

00:32:58.820 --> 00:32:58.830
left over has this joint and it is
 

00:32:58.830 --> 00:33:01.200
left over has this joint and it is
capable of connecting anywhere in the

00:33:01.200 --> 00:33:01.210
capable of connecting anywhere in the
 

00:33:01.210 --> 00:33:09.999
capable of connecting anywhere in the
structure

00:33:09.999 --> 00:33:10.009
 
 

00:33:10.009 --> 00:33:13.460
 
so here's just a the installation

00:33:13.460 --> 00:33:13.470
so here's just a the installation
 

00:33:13.470 --> 00:33:17.720
so here's just a the installation
sequence in Miami it would basically

00:33:17.720 --> 00:33:17.730
sequence in Miami it would basically
 

00:33:17.730 --> 00:33:20.479
sequence in Miami it would basically
take one day to put up a majority of the

00:33:20.479 --> 00:33:20.489
take one day to put up a majority of the
 

00:33:20.489 --> 00:33:26.710
take one day to put up a majority of the
structure and then a second day when

00:33:26.710 --> 00:33:26.720
structure and then a second day when
 

00:33:26.720 --> 00:33:29.509
structure and then a second day when
basic with any additional members that

00:33:29.509 --> 00:33:29.519
basic with any additional members that
 

00:33:29.519 --> 00:33:31.609
basic with any additional members that
are put in serve to further stiffen this

00:33:31.609 --> 00:33:31.619
are put in serve to further stiffen this
 

00:33:31.619 --> 00:33:34.119
are put in serve to further stiffen this
structure so it kind of like was was

00:33:34.119 --> 00:33:34.129
structure so it kind of like was was
 

00:33:34.129 --> 00:33:38.479
structure so it kind of like was was
made itself rigid over time as we

00:33:38.479 --> 00:33:38.489
made itself rigid over time as we
 

00:33:38.489 --> 00:33:42.169
made itself rigid over time as we
installed more pieces and then here in

00:33:42.169 --> 00:33:42.179
installed more pieces and then here in
 

00:33:42.179 --> 00:33:44.799
installed more pieces and then here in
the second day we're adding the this

00:33:44.799 --> 00:33:44.809
the second day we're adding the this
 

00:33:44.809 --> 00:33:47.899
the second day we're adding the this
secondary system to provide shade which

00:33:47.899 --> 00:33:47.909
secondary system to provide shade which
 

00:33:47.909 --> 00:33:50.720
secondary system to provide shade which
in this case where these plastic semi

00:33:50.720 --> 00:33:50.730
in this case where these plastic semi
 

00:33:50.730 --> 00:34:01.960
in this case where these plastic semi
flexible plastic panels

00:34:01.960 --> 00:34:01.970
 
 

00:34:01.970 --> 00:34:05.380
 
and so these these flexible panels also

00:34:05.380 --> 00:34:05.390
and so these these flexible panels also
 

00:34:05.390 --> 00:34:08.710
and so these these flexible panels also
were malleable enough that they could

00:34:08.710 --> 00:34:08.720
were malleable enough that they could
 

00:34:08.720 --> 00:34:11.970
were malleable enough that they could
kind of follow the geometry of the

00:34:11.970 --> 00:34:11.980
kind of follow the geometry of the
 

00:34:11.980 --> 00:34:20.590
kind of follow the geometry of the
resulting in plywood structure so one of

00:34:20.590 --> 00:34:20.600
resulting in plywood structure so one of
 

00:34:20.600 --> 00:34:22.660
resulting in plywood structure so one of
the one of the ways that we're really

00:34:22.660 --> 00:34:22.670
the one of the ways that we're really
 

00:34:22.670 --> 00:34:24.940
the one of the ways that we're really
working at this and central to our

00:34:24.940 --> 00:34:24.950
working at this and central to our
 

00:34:24.950 --> 00:34:26.860
working at this and central to our
practice in general is through building

00:34:26.860 --> 00:34:26.870
practice in general is through building
 

00:34:26.870 --> 00:34:29.830
practice in general is through building
we have a shop in Brooklyn adjacent to

00:34:29.830 --> 00:34:29.840
we have a shop in Brooklyn adjacent to
 

00:34:29.840 --> 00:34:32.470
we have a shop in Brooklyn adjacent to
our office and all of these pavilions

00:34:32.470 --> 00:34:32.480
our office and all of these pavilions
 

00:34:32.480 --> 00:34:34.240
our office and all of these pavilions
develop through building at a full scale

00:34:34.240 --> 00:34:34.250
develop through building at a full scale
 

00:34:34.250 --> 00:34:37.750
develop through building at a full scale
and making mock-ups and testing them to

00:34:37.750 --> 00:34:37.760
and making mock-ups and testing them to
 

00:34:37.760 --> 00:34:41.800
and making mock-ups and testing them to
see if we could get the get the

00:34:41.800 --> 00:34:41.810
see if we could get the get the
 

00:34:41.810 --> 00:34:43.810
see if we could get the get the
flexibility and deployability that we

00:34:43.810 --> 00:34:43.820
flexibility and deployability that we
 

00:34:43.820 --> 00:34:47.050
flexibility and deployability that we
were looking for and so we basically

00:34:47.050 --> 00:34:47.060
were looking for and so we basically
 

00:34:47.060 --> 00:34:49.990
were looking for and so we basically
build at a you know from smaller

00:34:49.990 --> 00:34:50.000
build at a you know from smaller
 

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:52.420
build at a you know from smaller
mock-ups up to larger and larger ones

00:34:52.420 --> 00:34:52.430
mock-ups up to larger and larger ones
 

00:34:52.430 --> 00:34:54.400
mock-ups up to larger and larger ones
we'd get temporary spaces in our

00:34:54.400 --> 00:34:54.410
we'd get temporary spaces in our
 

00:34:54.410 --> 00:35:01.480
we'd get temporary spaces in our
building do do fairly rigorous

00:35:01.480 --> 00:35:01.490
building do do fairly rigorous
 

00:35:01.490 --> 00:35:07.510
building do do fairly rigorous
structural analyses and then take it out

00:35:07.510 --> 00:35:07.520
structural analyses and then take it out
 

00:35:07.520 --> 00:35:09.670
structural analyses and then take it out
to an empty lot to do run throughs

00:35:09.670 --> 00:35:09.680

to make something temporary and we
 

00:44:01.840 --> 00:44:03.540
to make something temporary and we
agreed and we identified this the

00:44:03.540 --> 00:44:03.550
agreed and we identified this the
 

00:44:03.550 --> 00:44:05.010

forefront of pushing the envelope so to
 

00:44:40.270 --> 00:44:43.170
forefront of pushing the envelope so to
speak in this forum so anyway we just

00:44:43.170 --> 00:44:43.180
speak in this forum so anyway we just
 

00:44:43.180 --> 00:44:45.420
speak in this forum so anyway we just
started thinking about the whole and you

00:44:45.420 --> 00:44:45.430
started thinking about the whole and you
 

00:44:45.430 --> 00:44:49.770
started thinking about the whole and you
know what you can do with the whole and

00:44:49.770 --> 00:44:49.780
know what you can do with the whole and
 

00:44:49.780 --> 00:44:52.070
know what you can do with the whole and
you know so you can have fun with holes

00:44:52.070 --> 00:44:52.080
you know so you can have fun with holes
 

00:44:52.080 --> 00:44:54.630

yeah and so the concept I mean it's

00:44:58.510 --> 00:44:58.520
yeah and so the concept I mean it's
 

00:44:58.520 --> 00:45:00.960
yeah and so the concept I mean it's
really simple that we make a soft

00:45:00.960 --> 00:45:00.970
really simple that we make a soft
 

00:45:00.970 --> 00:45:06.030
really simple that we make a soft
structure that inflates and provides new

00:45:06.030 --> 00:45:06.040
structure that inflates and provides new
 

00:45:06.040 --> 00:45:11.770
structure that inflates and provides new
space for the museum and so that's

00:45:11.770 --> 00:45:11.780
space for the museum and so that's
 

00:45:11.780 --> 00:45:15.900
space for the museum and so that's
that's it and then and it does that and

00:45:15.900 --> 00:45:15.910
that's it and then and it does that and
 

00:45:15.910 --> 00:45:18.970
that's it and then and it does that and
in this this will happen twice a year

00:45:18.970 --> 00:45:18.980
in this this will happen twice a year
 

00:45:18.980 --> 00:45:20.380
in this this will happen twice a year
for one month every year in the fall and

00:45:20.380 --> 00:45:20.390
for one month every year in the fall and
 

00:45:20.390 --> 00:45:23.260
for one month every year in the fall and
spring and they'll have a series of

spring and they'll have a series of
 

00:45:23.270 --> 00:45:28.660
spring and they'll have a series of
events symposia that is new cafe etc I'm

we showed well this was the chosen one

01:01:12.440 --> 01:01:12.450
we showed well this was the chosen one
 

01:01:12.450 --> 01:01:14.900

so we studied of course all the stores

01:01:14.900 --> 01:01:14.910
so we studied of course all the stores
 

01:01:14.910 --> 01:01:16.700
so we studied of course all the stores
and we discovered that a lot of stores

01:01:16.700 --> 01:01:16.710
and we discovered that a lot of stores
 

01:01:16.710 --> 01:01:19.970
and we discovered that a lot of stores
nowadays have a kind of overview so we

01:01:19.970 --> 01:01:19.980
nowadays have a kind of overview so we
 

01:01:19.980 --> 01:01:22.490
nowadays have a kind of overview so we
thought we articulate that articulated

01:01:22.490 --> 01:01:22.500

which of course the team was all men so

01:05:11.660 --> 01:05:11.670
which of course the team was all men so
 

01:05:11.670 --> 01:05:28.600
which of course the team was all men so
it reflects that so this is

use the wiper motor of the car to
 

01:05:37.970 --> 01:05:41.180
use the wiper motor of the car to
simulate so it has a battery here so it

01:05:41.180 --> 01:05:41.190
simulate so it has a battery here so it
 

01:05:41.190 --> 01:05:43.490
simulate so it has a battery here so it
has no electricity the trace of

love these pictures

01:07:31.130 --> 01:07:31.140
 
 

01:07:31.140 --> 01:07:39.990
 
stretchability mil thickness so all this

01:07:39.990 --> 01:07:40.000
stretchability mil thickness so all this
 

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:47.890

kind of military

01:07:47.890 --> 01:07:47.900
 
 

01:07:47.900 --> 01:07:52.029
 
now it's also useful storages and for

01:07:52.029 --> 01:07:52.039
now it's also useful storages and for
 

01:07:52.039 --> 01:07:57.069
now it's also useful storages and for
still military purpose so we use that

01:07:57.069 --> 01:07:57.079
still military purpose so we use that
 

01:07:57.079 --> 01:08:00.630

you basically sprays its place spray

01:08:04.900 --> 01:08:04.910
you basically sprays its place spray
 

01:08:04.910 --> 01:08:08.859
you basically sprays its place spray
them and then it stretches after that

01:08:08.859 --> 01:08:08.869
them and then it stretches after that
 

01:08:08.869 --> 01:08:11.260
them and then it stretches after that
with a chemical reaction and it creates

01:08:11.260 --> 01:08:11.270
with a chemical reaction and it creates
 

01:08:11.270 --> 01:08:15.250
with a chemical reaction and it creates
the most logical three dimensional curve

01:08:15.250 --> 01:08:15.260
the most logical three dimensional curve
 

01:08:15.260 --> 01:08:25.490
the most logical three dimensional curve
with its stretches to fit

01:08:25.490 --> 01:08:25.500
 
 

01:08:25.500 --> 01:08:36.590
 
so this is how we rotate it

01:08:36.590 --> 01:08:36.600
 
 

01:08:36.600 --> 01:08:42.050
 
and so this was the cinema configuration

01:08:42.050 --> 01:08:42.060
and so this was the cinema configuration
 

01:08:42.060 --> 01:08:46.580
and so this was the cinema configuration

01:09:14.260 --> 01:09:18.870
what you see on the wall will be become
a floor in the future so we use those

01:09:18.870 --> 01:09:18.880
a floor in the future so we use those
 

01:09:18.880 --> 01:09:20.550
a floor in the future so we use those

it I think the representation is like a

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:38.010
it I think the representation is like a
 

01:12:38.010 --> 01:12:40.699

planning of the event itself to come up

01:12:40.699 --> 01:12:40.709
planning of the event itself to come up
 

01:12:40.709 --> 01:12:44.089
planning of the event itself to come up
with the event is the basically what

01:12:44.089 --> 01:12:44.099
with the event is the basically what
 

01:12:44.099 --> 01:12:45.819
with the event is the basically what
you're talking about I guess after

01:12:45.819 --> 01:12:45.829
you're talking about I guess after
 

01:12:45.829 --> 01:12:48.979
you're talking about I guess after
planning there's certain rules how to

01:12:48.979 --> 01:12:48.989
planning there's certain rules how to
 

01:12:48.989 --> 01:12:51.919
planning there's certain rules how to
achieve that or how to simulate them so

01:12:51.919 --> 01:12:51.929
achieve that or how to simulate them so
 

01:12:51.929 --> 01:12:55.060
achieve that or how to simulate them so
I also feel like in the case of a

European pavilion that you did it's more

01:12:57.949 --> 01:12:57.959
European pavilion that you did it's more
 

01:12:57.959 --> 01:13:02.419

may elevate the discussion to something
 

01:13:49.349 --> 01:13:51.409
may elevate the discussion to something
similar but I think there is a certain

01:26:36.500 --> 01:26:36.510
think one of the issues is said the
 

01:26:36.510 --> 01:26:39.150
think one of the issues is said the
bigger the building them or the bigger

01:26:39.150 --> 01:26:39.160
bigger the building them or the bigger
 

01:26:39.160 --> 01:26:42.660
bigger the building them or the bigger
the object being art or architecture the

01:26:42.660 --> 01:26:42.670
the object being art or architecture the
 

01:26:42.670 --> 01:26:45.300
the object being art or architecture the
more consensus you need around it and so

01:26:45.300 --> 01:26:45.310
more consensus you need around it and so
 

01:26:45.310 --> 01:26:48.440
more consensus you need around it and so
I think that when we look at a pavilion

01:26:48.440 --> 01:26:48.450
I think that when we look at a pavilion
 

01:26:48.450 --> 01:26:51.420
I think that when we look at a pavilion
when you look when you look at an

01:26:51.420 --> 01:26:51.430
when you look when you look at an
 

01:26:51.430 --> 01:26:55.410
when you look when you look at an
individual our piece you maybe need the

01:26:55.410 --> 01:26:55.420
individual our piece you maybe need the
 

01:26:55.420 --> 01:26:58.140
individual our piece you maybe need the
consensus of the artist and the person

01:26:58.140 --> 01:26:58.150

buying it hanging it talking about it
 

01:27:02.380 --> 01:27:03.600
buying it hanging it talking about it
and so you're talking about the

01:27:03.600 --> 01:27:03.610
and so you're talking about the
 

01:27:03.610 --> 01:27:06.420
and so you're talking about the
consensus of one to three people and

01:27:06.420 --> 01:27:06.430
consensus of one to three people and
 

01:27:06.430 --> 01:27:09.260
consensus of one to three people and
they larger you know in the dog Aiken

01:27:09.260 --> 01:27:09.270

brief on of her on a museum project
which I have gotten this they'll tell

01:39:20.229 --> 01:39:20.239
which I have gotten this they'll tell
 

01:39:20.239 --> 01:39:22.300
which I have gotten this they'll tell
you it needs its 24 25 year life span

01:39:22.300 --> 01:39:22.310
you it needs its 24 25 year life span
 

01:39:22.310 --> 01:39:26.170
you it needs its 24 25 year life span
which time it may get torn down it make

01:39:26.170 --> 01:39:26.180
which time it may get torn down it make
 

01:39:26.180 --> 01:39:29.200
which time it may get torn down it make
it added on to so I mean I get it's just

01:39:29.200 --> 01:39:29.210
it added on to so I mean I get it's just
 

01:39:29.210 --> 01:39:30.880
it added on to so I mean I get it's just
it's an academic way to look at it but I

01:39:30.880 --> 01:39:30.890
it's an academic way to look at it but I
 

01:39:30.890 --> 01:39:33.070
it's an academic way to look at it but I
think that you can't draw those

01:39:33.070 --> 01:39:33.080
think that you can't draw those
 

01:39:33.080 --> 01:39:36.040
think that you can't draw those
distinctions so precisely look at that

01:39:36.040 --> 01:39:36.050
distinctions so precisely look at that
 

01:39:36.050 --> 01:39:38.620
distinctions so precisely look at that
amazing presentation as the the graphics

01:39:38.620 --> 01:39:38.630
amazing presentation as the the graphics
 

01:39:38.630 --> 01:39:41.920
amazing presentation as the the graphics
of the you know take it tear it down and

01:39:41.920 --> 01:39:41.930
of the you know take it tear it down and
 

01:39:41.930 --> 01:39:43.950
of the you know take it tear it down and
build again

01:39:43.950 --> 01:39:43.960
build again
 

01:39:43.960 --> 01:39:48.100
build again
attitude is it does that mean that we

01:39:48.100 --> 01:39:48.110
attitude is it does that mean that we
 

01:39:48.110 --> 01:39:51.280
attitude is it does that mean that we
should be looking obviously this makes

01:39:51.280 --> 01:39:51.290
should be looking obviously this makes
 

01:39:51.290 --> 01:39:53.680
should be looking obviously this makes
perfect sense but beyond just looking at

01:39:53.680 --> 01:39:53.690
perfect sense but beyond just looking at
 

01:39:53.690 --> 01:39:55.450
perfect sense but beyond just looking at
pavilions it would seem to imply a

01:39:55.450 --> 01:39:55.460
pavilions it would seem to imply a
 

01:39:55.460 --> 01:39:57.520
pavilions it would seem to imply a
certain methodology about looking at

01:39:57.520 --> 01:39:57.530
certain methodology about looking at
 

01:39:57.530 --> 01:40:00.970
certain methodology about looking at
time in relation to construction and so

01:40:00.970 --> 01:40:00.980
time in relation to construction and so
 

01:40:00.980 --> 01:40:03.370
time in relation to construction and so
on to looking outside maybe go on a road

01:40:03.370 --> 01:40:03.380
on to looking outside maybe go on a road
 

01:40:03.380 --> 01:40:05.920
on to looking outside maybe go on a road
trip rather than staying here I mean

01:40:05.920 --> 01:40:05.930
trip rather than staying here I mean
 

01:40:05.930 --> 01:40:07.270
trip rather than staying here I mean
there are a lot of buildings that were

01:40:07.270 --> 01:40:07.280
there are a lot of buildings that were
 

01:40:07.280 --> 01:40:10.330
there are a lot of buildings that were
meant to be temporary in like expose but

01:40:10.330 --> 01:40:10.340
meant to be temporary in like expose but
 

01:40:10.340 --> 01:40:12.700
meant to be temporary in like expose but
became permanent I mean so those are

01:40:12.700 --> 01:40:12.710
became permanent I mean so those are
 

01:40:12.710 --> 01:40:14.890
became permanent I mean so those are
interesting example for you to look at

01:40:14.890 --> 01:40:14.900
interesting example for you to look at
 

01:40:14.900 --> 01:40:17.470
interesting example for you to look at
and what I wanted to say by showing the

01:40:17.470 --> 01:40:17.480
and what I wanted to say by showing the
 

01:40:17.480 --> 01:40:20.200
and what I wanted to say by showing the
Japanese case is that the scale of

01:40:20.200 --> 01:40:20.210
Japanese case is that the scale of
 

01:40:20.210 --> 01:40:22.990
Japanese case is that the scale of
temper ality also differs in different

01:40:22.990 --> 01:40:23.000
temper ality also differs in different
 

01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:26.980
temper ality also differs in different
culture so in Japan like you feat last

01:40:26.980 --> 01:40:26.990
culture so in Japan like you feat last
 

01:40:26.990 --> 01:40:29.230
culture so in Japan like you feat last
like more than 50 years that's almost

01:40:29.230 --> 01:40:29.240
like more than 50 years that's almost
 

01:40:29.240 --> 01:40:32.350
like more than 50 years that's almost
permanent nowadays it used to be

01:40:32.350 --> 01:40:32.360
permanent nowadays it used to be
 

01:40:32.360 --> 01:40:34.690
permanent nowadays it used to be
different but I think it's a great

01:40:34.690 --> 01:40:34.700
different but I think it's a great
 

01:40:34.700 --> 01:40:36.280
different but I think it's a great
privilege to be in control of your

01:40:36.280 --> 01:40:36.290
privilege to be in control of your
 

01:40:36.290 --> 01:40:38.350
privilege to be in control of your
demise of your own buildings you know I

01:40:38.350 --> 01:40:38.360
demise of your own buildings you know I
 

01:40:38.360 --> 01:40:40.810
demise of your own buildings you know I
say it's it's terrifying when you see

01:40:40.810 --> 01:40:40.820
say it's it's terrifying when you see
 

01:40:40.820 --> 01:40:46.900
say it's it's terrifying when you see
them the K so it's good give you thank

01:40:46.900 --> 01:40:46.910
them the K so it's good give you thank
 

01:40:46.910 --> 01:40:49.560
them the K so it's good give you thank
you for a really stimulating

01:40:49.560 --> 01:40:49.570
you for a really stimulating
 

01:40:49.570 --> 01:40:51.700
you for a really stimulating
presentation I'm not an architect but

01:40:51.700 --> 01:40:51.710
presentation I'm not an architect but
 

01:40:51.710 --> 01:40:54.100
presentation I'm not an architect but
what I noticed in that all of your

01:40:54.100 --> 01:40:54.110
what I noticed in that all of your
 

01:40:54.110 --> 01:40:55.690
what I noticed in that all of your
presentations had in common was that

01:40:55.690 --> 01:40:55.700
presentations had in common was that
 

01:40:55.700 --> 01:40:58.660
presentations had in common was that
they stressed the beauty of the

01:40:58.660 --> 01:40:58.670
they stressed the beauty of the
 

01:40:58.670 --> 01:41:00.910
they stressed the beauty of the
installation process and the

01:41:00.910 --> 01:41:00.920
installation process and the
 

01:41:00.920 --> 01:41:02.320
installation process and the
performativity of the installation

01:41:02.320 --> 01:41:02.330
performativity of the installation
 

01:41:02.330 --> 01:41:05.430
performativity of the installation
process and also in some cases of the

01:41:05.430 --> 01:41:05.440
process and also in some cases of the
 

01:41:05.440 --> 01:41:07.120
process and also in some cases of the
deconstruction I was thinking about the

01:41:07.120 --> 01:41:07.130
deconstruction I was thinking about the
 

01:41:07.130 --> 01:41:09.070
deconstruction I was thinking about the
herschel and thinking what I really want

01:41:09.070 --> 01:41:09.080
herschel and thinking what I really want
 

01:41:09.080 --> 01:41:12.130
herschel and thinking what I really want
to see is the bubble being inflated and

01:41:12.130 --> 01:41:12.140
to see is the bubble being inflated and
 

01:41:12.140 --> 01:41:16.270
to see is the bubble being inflated and
I wondered how much those of you who

01:41:16.270 --> 01:41:16.280
I wondered how much those of you who
 

01:41:16.280 --> 01:41:18.040
I wondered how much those of you who
regularly build these structures plan

01:41:18.040 --> 01:41:18.050
regularly build these structures plan
 

01:41:18.050 --> 01:41:22.660
regularly build these structures plan
for the aesthetics of the creation in

01:41:22.660 --> 01:41:22.670
for the aesthetics of the creation in
 

01:41:22.670 --> 01:41:25.690
for the aesthetics of the creation in
public and and then the deconstruction

01:41:25.690 --> 01:41:25.700
public and and then the deconstruction
 

01:41:25.700 --> 01:41:26.950
public and and then the deconstruction
as well whether that's something that

01:41:26.950 --> 01:41:26.960
as well whether that's something that
 

01:41:26.960 --> 01:41:29.880
as well whether that's something that
you really think about aesthetically and

01:41:29.880 --> 01:41:29.890
you really think about aesthetically and
 

01:41:29.890 --> 01:41:32.410
you really think about aesthetically and
if so whether that's really a defining

01:41:32.410 --> 01:41:32.420
if so whether that's really a defining
 

01:41:32.420 --> 01:41:37.480
if so whether that's really a defining
feature of temporary structures I could

01:41:37.480 --> 01:41:37.490
feature of temporary structures I could
 

01:41:37.490 --> 01:41:40.630
feature of temporary structures I could
say for for the projects I showed I mean

01:41:40.630 --> 01:41:40.640
say for for the projects I showed I mean
 

01:41:40.640 --> 01:41:43.060
say for for the projects I showed I mean
that was kind of the the project it's

01:41:43.060 --> 01:41:43.070
that was kind of the the project it's
 

01:41:43.070 --> 01:41:46.410
that was kind of the the project it's
like we were designing that event and

01:41:46.410 --> 01:41:46.420
like we were designing that event and
 

01:41:46.420 --> 01:41:49.480
like we were designing that event and
you know during that process we were

01:41:49.480 --> 01:41:49.490
you know during that process we were
 

01:41:49.490 --> 01:41:51.790
you know during that process we were
sort of guiding where it would go but

01:41:51.790 --> 01:41:51.800
sort of guiding where it would go but
 

01:41:51.800 --> 01:41:52.360
sort of guiding where it would go but
I'm

01:41:52.360 --> 01:41:52.370
I'm
 

01:41:52.370 --> 01:41:55.320
I'm
the whole form was resolved during that

01:41:55.320 --> 01:41:55.330
the whole form was resolved during that
 

01:41:55.330 --> 01:42:00.040
the whole form was resolved during that
that event which you know you could then

01:42:00.040 --> 01:42:00.050
that event which you know you could then
 

01:42:00.050 --> 01:42:01.630
that event which you know you could then
carry it through the entire like

01:42:01.630 --> 01:42:01.640
carry it through the entire like
 

01:42:01.640 --> 01:42:04.210
carry it through the entire like
delivery the Assembly of it and then

01:42:04.210 --> 01:42:04.220
delivery the Assembly of it and then
 

01:42:04.220 --> 01:42:06.070
delivery the Assembly of it and then
through the life of the festival which

01:42:06.070 --> 01:42:06.080
through the life of the festival which
 

01:42:06.080 --> 01:42:10.420
through the life of the festival which
is also this short term event so it's

01:42:10.420 --> 01:42:10.430
is also this short term event so it's
 

01:42:10.430 --> 01:42:12.280
is also this short term event so it's
kind of yeah I mean that whole period of

01:42:12.280 --> 01:42:12.290
kind of yeah I mean that whole period of
 

01:42:12.290 --> 01:42:15.520
kind of yeah I mean that whole period of
time it was really the purpose in the

01:42:15.520 --> 01:42:15.530
time it was really the purpose in the
 

01:42:15.530 --> 01:42:18.460
time it was really the purpose in the
case of those three pavilions I also

01:42:18.460 --> 01:42:18.470
case of those three pavilions I also
 

01:42:18.470 --> 01:42:21.520
case of those three pavilions I also
think the in the in situ case there is

01:42:21.520 --> 01:42:21.530
think the in the in situ case there is
 

01:42:21.530 --> 01:42:25.570
think the in the in situ case there is
it you you created a way of addicting

01:42:25.570 --> 01:42:25.580
it you you created a way of addicting
 

01:42:25.580 --> 01:42:28.270
it you you created a way of addicting
the place that it's kind of anxiety free

01:42:28.270 --> 01:42:28.280
the place that it's kind of anxiety free
 

01:42:28.280 --> 01:42:30.280
the place that it's kind of anxiety free
in a way is because it's not a in

01:42:30.280 --> 01:42:30.290
in a way is because it's not a in
 

01:42:30.290 --> 01:42:31.720
in a way is because it's not a in
architecture you usually have a

01:42:31.720 --> 01:42:31.730
architecture you usually have a
 

01:42:31.730 --> 01:42:34.060
architecture you usually have a
prescriptive form it needs to look this

01:42:34.060 --> 01:42:34.070
prescriptive form it needs to look this
 

01:42:34.070 --> 01:42:36.730
prescriptive form it needs to look this
way at the end and in your case you

01:42:36.730 --> 01:42:36.740
way at the end and in your case you
 

01:42:36.740 --> 01:42:39.160
way at the end and in your case you
created a process therefore it doesn't

01:42:39.160 --> 01:42:39.170
created a process therefore it doesn't
 

01:42:39.170 --> 01:42:43.600
created a process therefore it doesn't
really matter so much how exactly goes

01:42:43.600 --> 01:42:43.610
really matter so much how exactly goes
 

01:42:43.610 --> 01:42:45.970
really matter so much how exactly goes
together as long as kind of it goes

01:42:45.970 --> 01:42:45.980
together as long as kind of it goes
 

01:42:45.980 --> 01:42:54.370
together as long as kind of it goes
through a series of rules in a different

01:42:54.370 --> 01:42:54.380
through a series of rules in a different
 

01:42:54.380 --> 01:42:58.210
through a series of rules in a different
case it's different but one thing I want

01:42:58.210 --> 01:42:58.220
case it's different but one thing I want
 

01:42:58.220 --> 01:43:01.210
case it's different but one thing I want
to say that after 911 I think even in a

01:43:01.210 --> 01:43:01.220
to say that after 911 I think even in a
 

01:43:01.220 --> 01:43:03.450
to say that after 911 I think even in a
permanent structure people started to

01:43:03.450 --> 01:43:03.460
permanent structure people started to
 

01:43:03.460 --> 01:43:07.030
permanent structure people started to
imagine how it could collapse I think

01:43:07.030 --> 01:43:07.040
imagine how it could collapse I think
 

01:43:07.040 --> 01:43:10.810
imagine how it could collapse I think
that was the whole I not I open and that

01:43:10.810 --> 01:43:10.820
that was the whole I not I open and that
 

01:43:10.820 --> 01:43:15.900
that was the whole I not I open and that
sounds positive but you know very

01:43:15.900 --> 01:43:15.910
sounds positive but you know very
 

01:43:15.910 --> 01:43:20.050
sounds positive but you know very
uncommon to see such an event and to

01:43:20.050 --> 01:43:20.060
uncommon to see such an event and to
 

01:43:20.060 --> 01:43:21.760
uncommon to see such an event and to
realize how building can be so

01:43:21.760 --> 01:43:21.770
realize how building can be so
 

01:43:21.770 --> 01:43:26.800
realize how building can be so
vulnerable and collapse yeah i'm

01:43:26.800 --> 01:43:26.810
vulnerable and collapse yeah i'm
 

01:43:26.810 --> 01:43:29.500
vulnerable and collapse yeah i'm
wondering if or your thoughts if you

01:43:29.500 --> 01:43:29.510
wondering if or your thoughts if you
 

01:43:29.510 --> 01:43:32.160
wondering if or your thoughts if you
think that architecture is the or

01:43:32.160 --> 01:43:32.170
think that architecture is the or
 

01:43:32.170 --> 01:43:34.630
think that architecture is the or
pavilions are the most appropriate mode

01:43:34.630 --> 01:43:34.640
pavilions are the most appropriate mode
 

01:43:34.640 --> 01:43:37.270
pavilions are the most appropriate mode
for architecture in this age which is

01:43:37.270 --> 01:43:37.280
for architecture in this age which is
 

01:43:37.280 --> 01:43:40.320
