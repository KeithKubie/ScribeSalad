00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:03.770
We're now ready to get into the
meat of evaluating this surface

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:04.270
integral.

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:05.728
And we really need
to re-express it

00:00:05.728 --> 00:00:10.152
in terms of a double integral
in the domain of the parameters.

00:00:10.152 --> 00:00:11.610
And the first thing
I'm going to do

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.290
is rewrite this part right
over here using our parameters.

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:21.300
And we already know that n, our
normal vector times our surface

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.320
differential, can
also be written

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:25.640
as kind of a vector version
of our surface differential

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.720
that points in the same
direction as our normal vector.

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:30.591
And this is going to
be the same thing.

00:00:30.591 --> 00:00:32.090
And we need to make
sure that we get

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:33.960
the order on the
cross product right

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.420
as the partial
derivative-- and I'm

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:36.836
going to confirm
this in a second.

00:00:39.396 --> 00:00:41.270
The partial derivative
of the parametrization

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:43.170
with respect to one
of the parameters

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.160
crossed with the
partial derivative

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.142
of the parametrization with
respect to the other parameter.

00:00:48.142 --> 00:00:49.600
And then that whole
thing-- I'm not

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.933
going to take the absolute
value because I need a vector

00:00:51.933 --> 00:00:53.780
right over here--
times differentials

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:57.510
of the parameters-- d theta
dr. And we can swap these two

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.580
things around depending
on what will make

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:01.650
our eventual double
integral easier.

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:03.430
But we can't swap
these two things around

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:04.846
because this would
actually change

00:01:04.846 --> 00:01:06.110
the direction of the vector.

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:08.720
So we need to make sure
that this is popping us out

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:10.500
in the right direction.

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.420
So let's think
about the direction

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.970
that the partial with
respect to r will take us.

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.910
So as r increases, we're
going to be moving radially

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:21.450
outward from the
center of our surface.

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:22.990
Let me do this in
a different color.

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:26.270
As r increases, we'll be
moving radially outwards.

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:29.550
So this quantity
will be a vector

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:31.230
that looks something like that.

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:33.380
And then as theta
increases, we'll

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:37.745
be going roughly
in that direction.

00:01:37.745 --> 00:01:40.120
And so if we take the cross
product of those two things--

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:42.040
and we could use
the right-hand rule.

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:44.420
Take your right hand,
point your index finger

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:46.190
in the direction of
that yellow vector.

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:48.440
Let me make it clear-- this
is the orange vector right

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.941
over here.

00:01:48.941 --> 00:01:50.565
Take your index finger
in the direction

00:01:50.565 --> 00:01:51.570
of that yellow vector.

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.260
So that's my index finger,
my shakily drawn yellow index

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.910
finger.

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:57.580
Put your middle finger in the
direction of the orange vector.

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:59.080
So my middle, you
bend it and put it

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:00.500
in the direction of
the orange vector.

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.500
And we don't care what
the other two fingers do.

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.710
And then, your thumb
will be in the direction

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:05.990
of the cross product.

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:09.680
So your thumb will
point outward like that.

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:11.402
That's my best
attempt at drawing it.

00:02:11.402 --> 00:02:13.610
Which is exactly the direction
we needed to point it.

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:15.276
We need it to point
upward here in order

00:02:15.276 --> 00:02:17.970
to be oriented properly
with the direction

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:19.690
that we are actually
traversing the path.

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:21.256
So this is actually
the right order.

00:02:21.256 --> 00:02:23.130
If when we did this we
got the thumb pointing

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.910
into it or below
the plane, then we

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:28.010
would actually have
to swap these orders.

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:29.426
So with that out
of the way, let's

00:02:29.426 --> 00:02:31.280
actually evaluate
this cross product.

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.970
So the cross product of the
partial of our parametrization

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:39.820
with respect to r
crossed with the partial

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:41.850
of our parametrization
with respect to theta.

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:45.280
I like to set up the matrix
to take the cross product.

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:51.850
So we'll put i, j, and k
components, &lt; like that.

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:56.510
And then, first, I will write
the partial with respect to r.

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:58.760
So the i-component, if you
take the derivative of this

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:02.670
with respect to r, is just
going to be cosine theta.

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.350
The derivative of
this with respect to r

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:07.760
is just sine theta.

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:09.980
And the derivative of
this with respect to are r

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:12.400
is just going to be a
negative sine theta.

00:03:17.659 --> 00:03:19.450
And then we're going
to cross it with this,

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:22.690
so the derivative of this
with respect to theta

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:25.310
is going to be negative
r sine of theta.

00:03:30.426 --> 00:03:31.800
The derivative of
our j-component

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:34.305
with respect to theta
will be r cosine theta.

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:40.065
And the derivative
or our k-component--

00:03:40.065 --> 00:03:42.670
or our z-component
with respect to theta--

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:46.245
is going to be-- let's see--
negative r cosine theta.

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:50.880
Is that right?

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:51.904
Yeah.

00:03:51.904 --> 00:03:53.570
Derivative of sine
theta's cosine theta.

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:54.070
Yeah.

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:56.370
So it's negative r cosine theta.

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:00.310
And now we just evaluate
this determinant over here.

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:03.710
Our i-component is
going to be-- so

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:06.290
ignore that row and this column.

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:11.740
And we get sine times
negative r cosine theta.

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:13.290
I'll just do this
in a new color.

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:16.380
So we're going to get negative
r-- that wasn't a new color.

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:18.320
I'll do it in purple.

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:27.877
We will get negative r cosine
theta sine theta minus-- well,

00:04:27.877 --> 00:04:29.460
this is going to be
a negative number.

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:32.043
So when you subtract a negative
number, it's going to be plus.

00:04:32.043 --> 00:04:35.870
So it's going to be plus
r cosine theta sine theta.

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:41.385
It's always nice when
things cancel out like this.

00:04:41.385 --> 00:04:42.976
This plus this is just 0.

00:04:42.976 --> 00:04:44.600
Negative of it plus
the positive of it.

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:46.160
So that all canceled out to 0.

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:47.960
We don't have an i-component.

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:49.391
Now, let's go to
the j-component.

00:04:49.391 --> 00:04:51.890
And remember, we need to do our
little checkerboard pattern.

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:54.080
So it's going to be minus j.

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:57.280
And it's going to be-- ignore
this column, that row-- cosine

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:58.710
theta times negative r.

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:04.540
Cosine theta is negative
r cosine squared theta.

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:06.240
I just multiplied those two.

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:13.559
And then, from that I'm going
to subtract this times that.

00:05:13.559 --> 00:05:15.600
And so this times that,
the negatives cancel out.

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:18.970
We get r sine squared theta.

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:20.740
So this is minus--
let me make sure.

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:22.948
Yeah, I'm going to subtract
the product of these two.

00:05:22.948 --> 00:05:24.370
The product is positive.

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:27.276
It's going to be r
sine squared theta.

00:05:27.276 --> 00:05:28.400
This is always a hard part.

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:30.520
You can make a lot of
careless mistakes here.

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:32.520
And this looks like we
might be able to simplify

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:34.020
this in a second, but I'll wait.

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:35.690
Actually, I'll just distribute
this negative sign just

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:36.190
for fun.

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:37.540
So if we distribute
the negative sign,

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:38.730
these all become positive.

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:40.680
Helps simplify
things a little bit.

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:42.990
And now let's worry
about the k-component.

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:45.430
The k-component I will be
doing in purple-- well,

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:46.520
I'll do it in blue.

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:47.340
The k-component.

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:48.840
Ignore this row,
ignore this column.

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:54.120
So plus k times cosine
theta times r cosine theta

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:57.960
is r cosine squared of theta.

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:02.120
And then from that, I'm going
to subtract negative r sine

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:03.830
theta times sine theta.

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:06.102
So that's going to be
negative r sine squared theta,

00:06:06.102 --> 00:06:07.060
but I'm subtracting it.

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:11.260
So it's going to be plus
r sine squared theta.

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:13.650
And this looks like we're
going to simplify it as well.

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:15.130
And so this piece
right over here,

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:17.200
we can factor out--
let me just rewrite it.

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:23.500
This can be rewritten as r
times cosine squared theta

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:26.600
plus sine squared theta.

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:28.130
Basic trig identity.

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:29.500
That just evaluates to 1.

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:31.470
So this is just r times j.

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:35.000
And this over here simplifies
for the exact same reason.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:43.410
This is r times cosine squared
theta plus sine squared theta.

00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:45.370
This also is just 1.

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:49.400
So this just simplifies
to r times k.

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:51.850
This whole cross product--
all of this business right

00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:54.610
over here-- simplified
to, quite luckily,

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:57.560
is equal to r times
our j unit vector

00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:03.480
plus r times our k unit vector.

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:05.810
And so now we can write
our surface integral.

00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:07.350
Our original surface
integral we can

00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:09.342
write as the double integral.

00:07:09.342 --> 00:07:11.800
Or we might want to change the
order in which we integrate,

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:14.133
but we'll give ourselves that
option a little bit later.

00:07:14.133 --> 00:07:15.250
Double integral.

00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:18.960
Now, it's going to be over our
parameter domain or the r theta

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:20.010
domain.

00:07:20.010 --> 00:07:23.600
So it's the double integral of--
we still have the curl of f.

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:25.810
And we're going to have
to evaluate the curl of f.

00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:30.150
So I'll just write "curl
of our vector field

00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:40.816
f" dotted with this
business, rj plus rk.

00:07:40.816 --> 00:07:42.315
And then we have
our two parameters.

00:07:42.315 --> 00:07:43.910
And we might want
to switch the order.

00:07:43.910 --> 00:07:47.352
So maybe we could
write d theta dr.

00:07:47.352 --> 00:07:48.810
And then if we do
it in this order,

00:07:48.810 --> 00:07:52.742
theta goes from 0 to 2 pi,
and r is going from 0 to 1.

00:07:52.742 --> 00:07:54.450
But if we swap these
two, then obviously,

00:07:54.450 --> 00:07:56.410
we're going to have to
swap these two as well.

00:07:56.410 --> 00:07:57.284
I'll leave you there.

00:07:57.284 --> 00:07:59.622
In the next video, we will
evaluate the curl of f.

00:07:59.622 --> 00:08:01.330
And maybe in that
video, if we have time,

00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:04.340
we will get to the finish line.
