This is your update on
the coolest developer news

Firebase in-app messaging
is now available.

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.000
It will help you
guide active app users

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.159
by sending them targeted
and contextual messages.

00:00:14.159 --> 00:00:16.200
Take a look at the post
linked in the description

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:19.394

The Wear app review

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:29.100
since the launch of
Android Wear 2.0,

will soon become mandatory.

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.520
New apps listed on
the Wear OS by Google

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.980
version of the Google Play
Store will require review

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.400
beginning in October of 2018,
while updates to existing apps

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.830
will require review

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:43.720
For details, take

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:45.330
You can now author
Cloud Functions

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:47.286
that use headless
Chrome and utilize

00:00:47.286 --> 00:00:48.660
all the features
of a web browser

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.580
in a fully serverless
environment.

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:52.260
Use cases include
taking screenshots

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.990
of web pages, server-side
rendering, implementing web

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:56.130
crawlers, and more.

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:59.040
Example code is on the post.

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.170
Earlier this year,
Google's Project Zero team

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.330
disclosed serious
security flaws rooted

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:05.129
in speculative execution.

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.500
Spectre and Meltdown
were the first instances

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:08.460
of these attacks.

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.140
And now Intel has
published details

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.145

execution vulnerabilities.

00:01:13.145 --> 00:01:14.520
Head on over to
the post to learn

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.190
how to mitigate guest control
entries not controlled

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:20.130
by the host OS and what steps
you may need to take to ensure

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.140
you're fully protected.
