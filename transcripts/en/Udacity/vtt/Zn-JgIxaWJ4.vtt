00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
So 60°. What would that be in our new units?

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
½? Or is it 1 radian?

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Or is it 2 radian? Or is it 3 radian?

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
0.1 radian. How many degrees would that be:

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
6°, 7°, 12°, or 24°?

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
And if we have this right triangle,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
which has an angle of 40 angular degrees here,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
a right angle here, a hypotenuse of 10 units,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
how long would this leg be?

00:00:36.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Would it be 5.0 units, 6.4 units, 6.5 units, 6.6 units?
