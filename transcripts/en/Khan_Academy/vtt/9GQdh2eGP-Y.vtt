00:00:00.594 --> 00:00:01.600
- [Instructor] In other videos,

00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:04.336
we talk about how 10 to 15,000 years ago.

00:00:04.336 --> 00:00:07.118
You have the emergence of agriculture

00:00:07.118 --> 00:00:10.370
primarily around river valleys,

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:12.393
and it's no surprise that agriculture

00:00:12.393 --> 00:00:14.853
first came about around river valleys

00:00:14.853 --> 00:00:17.040
because the rivers would flood,

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:19.410
making the soil around them fertile.

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.339
They would provide fresh water for crops

00:00:22.339 --> 00:00:24.421
and for the people who
would live near them.

00:00:24.421 --> 00:00:26.520
Later on, the rivers could be useful for

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:29.335
transporting things like crops,

00:00:29.335 --> 00:00:31.076
and so it's not surprising that our

00:00:31.076 --> 00:00:33.978
first significant
civilizations also emerged

00:00:33.978 --> 00:00:37.093
where the first agriculture emerged.

00:00:37.093 --> 00:00:38.728
And our first civilizations we'll see

00:00:38.728 --> 00:00:41.274
in ancient Egypt along the Nile.

00:00:41.274 --> 00:00:45.338
We will see it in the Indus
Valley along the Indus River.

00:00:45.338 --> 00:00:49.569
We'll see it in China along
the Yellow and Yangtze Rivers,

00:00:49.569 --> 00:00:51.979
and we'll also see it in Mesopotamia

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:55.229
along the Tigress and Euphrates Rivers.

00:00:56.726 --> 00:00:58.779
And what we're gonna focus on in

00:00:58.779 --> 00:01:02.112
this video in particular is Mesopotamia.

00:01:03.814 --> 00:01:05.379
Now, the word Mesopotamia
literally come from

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:07.613
meso, between, and potamos.

00:01:07.613 --> 00:01:10.772
I'm probably not pronouncing
it right, rivers.

00:01:10.772 --> 00:01:13.433
So it's the area between
rivers is literally

00:01:13.433 --> 00:01:15.839
what Mesopotamia is referring to.

00:01:15.839 --> 00:01:19.587
And it's primarily modern day Iraq.

00:01:19.587 --> 00:01:21.707
Now the reason why this is
particularly interesting

00:01:21.707 --> 00:01:24.027
and it's called the
cradle of civilization,

00:01:24.027 --> 00:01:27.345
is not only is it one of or perhaps

00:01:27.345 --> 00:01:29.899
the first place that
agriculture developed,

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:33.916
it was at the crossroads of
many other early civilizations.

00:01:33.916 --> 00:01:35.840
Notice it's right in between

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.673
the Indus Valley civilization here,

00:01:37.673 --> 00:01:39.722
and then the ancient Egyptians,

00:01:39.722 --> 00:01:42.851
and other civilizations that
were emerging in the area.

00:01:42.851 --> 00:01:44.517
And so it's not surprising that this was

00:01:44.517 --> 00:01:47.835
a geography that had
significant developments

00:01:47.835 --> 00:01:50.977
in terms of technology,
in terms of architecture,

00:01:50.977 --> 00:01:54.576
in terms of religion, in terms of writing.

00:01:54.576 --> 00:01:57.138
And the first civilization we believe

00:01:57.138 --> 00:02:01.180
that emerged in Mesopotamia
are the Sumerians.

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:02.013
Sumerians.

00:02:04.924 --> 00:02:07.677
And Sumeria and Sumerians,
it's most associated with

00:02:07.677 --> 00:02:12.463
this region right over
here of, let me circle it,

00:02:12.463 --> 00:02:17.251
this region right over here
of southern Mesopotamia.

00:02:17.251 --> 00:02:19.477
And we currently think
that this civilization

00:02:19.477 --> 00:02:22.747
started to emerge around 4000 BCE.

00:02:22.747 --> 00:02:25.368
You can see it on this
timeline here in orange,

00:02:25.368 --> 00:02:30.116
and they developed things
as basic as the wheel.

00:02:30.116 --> 00:02:31.637
The first wheel that was ever discovered

00:02:31.637 --> 00:02:33.637
was 3500 BCE in Sumeria.

00:02:35.873 --> 00:02:37.974
They're famous for their
architectural structures.

00:02:37.974 --> 00:02:39.786
This is a picture here of a ziggurat,

00:02:39.786 --> 00:02:41.515
which was at the center of many of

00:02:41.515 --> 00:02:44.774
these Sumerian and as we'll
see Mesopotamian cities.

00:02:44.774 --> 00:02:47.620
This would require an incredible
amount of labor to produce,

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:50.565
and at the top of these they
had temples to their Gods

00:02:50.565 --> 00:02:53.416
and their Gods, they had
a polytheistic religion,

00:02:53.416 --> 00:02:55.999
and their Gods took human form.

00:02:58.341 --> 00:03:02.358
Also amongst the Sumerians
is where we think

00:03:02.358 --> 00:03:05.658
one of the first written
languages developed.

00:03:05.658 --> 00:03:06.662
It wasn't the first.

00:03:06.662 --> 00:03:07.895
You also have the Egyptian hieroglyphics

00:03:07.895 --> 00:03:09.841
and written language emerged amongst

00:03:09.841 --> 00:03:12.925
the Harappans and the
Indus Valley civilization

00:03:12.925 --> 00:03:14.774
and amongst the Chinese,

00:03:14.774 --> 00:03:16.511
but it was one of the first languages.

00:03:16.511 --> 00:03:20.156
This right over here is an
example of a cuneiform tablet.

00:03:20.156 --> 00:03:24.210
This is a cuneiform tablet
written in the script.

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:28.127
Cuneiform developed by
these ancient Sumerians.

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:32.163
Now, when you talk about Mesopotamia,

00:03:32.163 --> 00:03:33.452
you'll talk about Sumerians,

00:03:33.452 --> 00:03:36.695
but we'll also talk about other
civilizations that emerge.

00:03:36.695 --> 00:03:38.334
In particular, let me write them all down.

00:03:38.334 --> 00:03:39.788
You have the Sumerians.

00:03:39.788 --> 00:03:41.877
You'll also hear
something called Akkadian,

00:03:41.877 --> 00:03:45.556
and as we'll see, Akkadian
is both a language

00:03:45.556 --> 00:03:48.341
and an empire that will emerge.

00:03:48.341 --> 00:03:52.341
In Mesopotamia over the
roughly 3,000 years BCE,

00:03:54.316 --> 00:03:58.260
the two primary languages are Akkadian,

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.608
which is considered a Semitic language.

00:04:01.608 --> 00:04:03.913
It's related to modern Semitic languages,

00:04:03.913 --> 00:04:06.496
like Arabic and Hebrew,

00:04:06.496 --> 00:04:08.280
and the reason why
they're called Semitic is

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.533
because they're spoken or
they're reported to be spoken

00:04:10.533 --> 00:04:14.337
by the descendants of
Shem, who was Noah's son,

00:04:14.337 --> 00:04:16.591
in the Hebrew bible.

00:04:16.591 --> 00:04:19.169
So, you have the language
Akkadian, which is Semitic,

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:21.639
and then you have the other
language, which is Sumerian.

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:25.306
And as we get into the
third millennium BCE,

00:04:26.599 --> 00:04:28.995
the Sumerians start to have a lot of

00:04:28.995 --> 00:04:31.034
interaction with Akkadian speaking people,

00:04:31.034 --> 00:04:33.944
and Akkadian speaking people
are initially associated

00:04:33.944 --> 00:04:37.091
primarily with northern Mesopotamia,

00:04:37.091 --> 00:04:41.493
and we believe the first
empire, true empire,

00:04:41.493 --> 00:04:45.789
perhaps the first empire in
the world emerged from Acadia,

00:04:45.789 --> 00:04:47.962
and it was called the Akkadian Empire.

00:04:47.962 --> 00:04:50.629
And if we scroll down over here,

00:04:52.876 --> 00:04:56.368
we can see how the Akkadian Empire spread.

00:04:56.368 --> 00:04:58.436
We believe that the town of Akkad,

00:04:58.436 --> 00:05:00.999
which the Akkadian Empire is named for,

00:05:00.999 --> 00:05:03.101
some place in this region right over here,

00:05:03.101 --> 00:05:04.799
and the first significant ruler

00:05:04.799 --> 00:05:07.288
who really spread that empire was Sargon,

00:05:07.288 --> 00:05:10.855
often referred to as Sargon the Great.

00:05:10.855 --> 00:05:13.694
And you can see, you can see that

00:05:13.694 --> 00:05:15.499
that would have been established around

00:05:15.499 --> 00:05:19.666
the middle of the 23rd, or
actually the 24th century BCE.

00:05:21.797 --> 00:05:24.720
So around 2350, you
have Sargon establishing

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:27.584
what might be the first
Dynastic empire in the world,

00:05:27.584 --> 00:05:29.094
the Akkadian Empire,

00:05:29.094 --> 00:05:31.091
and he was able to take control of

00:05:31.091 --> 00:05:33.667
both northern and southern Mesopotamia,

00:05:33.667 --> 00:05:35.933
so even the Sumerians were under

00:05:35.933 --> 00:05:37.660
the control of the Akkadians.

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:38.890
As we'll see over time,

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:41.603
you have a lot of mixing
between the Akkadian language,

00:05:41.603 --> 00:05:42.866
the Sumerian language.

00:05:42.866 --> 00:05:46.132
Akkadian gets written
in the Cuneiform script,

00:05:46.132 --> 00:05:47.900
and starting at around this period,

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:50.168
Sumerian starts to die
as a spoken language

00:05:50.168 --> 00:05:52.538
and Akkadian really becomes dominant.

00:05:52.538 --> 00:05:57.001
Now, the Akkadians rule for
a little over 100 years,

00:05:57.001 --> 00:06:00.026
and then you have several other empires.

00:06:00.026 --> 00:06:01.313
It can get confusing.

00:06:01.313 --> 00:06:03.026
The way I have structured this timeline is

00:06:03.026 --> 00:06:05.680
this top line right over
here is southern Mesopotamia

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:09.067
and this bottom line right over
here is northern Mesopotamia

00:06:09.067 --> 00:06:12.335
so this orange shows you where
the Sumerians were reigning.

00:06:12.335 --> 00:06:14.059
Some people think that they might

00:06:14.059 --> 00:06:15.306
have been the first empire.

00:06:15.306 --> 00:06:17.316
This bottom line here, you
can see the Akkadian speakers,

00:06:17.316 --> 00:06:20.285
but they were fragmented until
you have Sargon the great

00:06:20.285 --> 00:06:22.863
establishing the Akkadian Empire.

00:06:22.863 --> 00:06:27.030
Now, you briefly then have a
short-term neo-Sumerian empire,

00:06:28.398 --> 00:06:31.330
but the next significant empire
that's often talked about

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:36.234
when associated with Mesopotamia
is the Babylonian Empire.

00:06:36.234 --> 00:06:38.838
So Babylon, the Babylonian Empire

00:06:38.838 --> 00:06:40.928
was centered at Babylon, right over here,

00:06:40.928 --> 00:06:44.454
and it really became a significant empire

00:06:44.454 --> 00:06:47.428
under the ruler Hammurabi.

00:06:47.428 --> 00:06:49.999
And Hammurabi is perhaps most known,

00:06:49.999 --> 00:06:52.269
you can see how he was
able to spread the empire.

00:06:52.269 --> 00:06:55.777
The dark brown is what he had with

00:06:55.777 --> 00:06:57.858
this empire when he took rule,

00:06:57.858 --> 00:07:00.121
and the light brown is what
he was able to spread it to,

00:07:00.121 --> 00:07:01.916
so once again, both north and south,

00:07:01.916 --> 00:07:03.607
and he's perhaps most famous for

00:07:03.607 --> 00:07:07.039
his famous code of Hammurabi,
which is depicted here,

00:07:07.039 --> 00:07:09.671
and it wasn't the first written code,

00:07:09.671 --> 00:07:11.568
but it was one of the earliest,

00:07:11.568 --> 00:07:14.376
and you could view it as
almost a proto-constitution,

00:07:14.376 --> 00:07:17.340
and it was based on things
that the Sumerians had before,

00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:20.677
but they've even influenced
things like biblical laws,

00:07:20.677 --> 00:07:24.668
things that come down to
modern codes of law today.

00:07:24.668 --> 00:07:26.740
Now, after the Babylonians,

00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:30.015
the other significant empire
that would have control over

00:07:30.015 --> 00:07:34.457
significant portions of
Mesopotamia is the Assyrian Empire.

00:07:34.457 --> 00:07:37.191
And the Assyrian Empire
is named for their,

00:07:37.191 --> 00:07:41.941
I guess you could say their
home base, the town of Assur.

00:07:41.941 --> 00:07:43.482
You can see it in this map here,

00:07:43.482 --> 00:07:45.060
where we showed the Akkadian Empire.

00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:47.150
And both the Babylonians and the Assyrians

00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:49.788
were Akkadian speaking,
so at this point now,

00:07:49.788 --> 00:07:52.351
and as we get into the
later Assyrian period,

00:07:52.351 --> 00:07:54.922
we'll start to have Aramaic be
a more significant language,

00:07:54.922 --> 00:07:57.579
another Semitic language,
but as you can see here,

00:07:57.579 --> 00:07:59.721
the Assyrian Empire at its peak controlled

00:07:59.721 --> 00:08:02.638
much of the modern day Middle East.

00:08:03.496 --> 00:08:06.213
Now, the Assyrian Empire
would eventually collapse

00:08:06.213 --> 00:08:08.463
in the seventh century BCE,

00:08:09.412 --> 00:08:12.513
and it would be taken over
by the Neobabylonian Empire.

00:08:12.513 --> 00:08:15.596
I have a map of that right over here,

00:08:16.774 --> 00:08:19.464
which also controlled much
of the modern middle east.

00:08:19.464 --> 00:08:22.655
Probably the most famous ruler
of the Neobabylonian Empire

00:08:22.655 --> 00:08:26.089
was Nebuchadnezzar II from
the Hebrew bible famous for

00:08:26.089 --> 00:08:29.339
taking the early Jewish people captive,

00:08:31.822 --> 00:08:33.796
the famous Babylonian captivity,

00:08:33.796 --> 00:08:35.971
but eventually they would be overthrown,

00:08:35.971 --> 00:08:39.952
and they would be overthrown
in the sixth century BCE

00:08:39.952 --> 00:08:43.263
by the Persians and Cyrus the Great,

00:08:43.263 --> 00:08:44.849
and that'll actually be the end of

00:08:44.849 --> 00:08:48.077
the Babylonian captivity
according to biblical accounts.

00:08:48.077 --> 00:08:50.692
But the big picture is
that Mesopotamia is called

00:08:50.692 --> 00:08:54.582
the cradle of civilization
for a good reason.

00:08:54.582 --> 00:08:56.536
Not only do we have these technological

00:08:56.536 --> 00:08:58.405
and architectural advancements,

00:08:58.405 --> 00:09:01.490
their religion, their writing
has influenced civilization

00:09:01.490 --> 00:09:05.073
since, for the last
five, six, 7,000 years.

00:09:08.121 --> 00:09:11.146
Well, I'd say definitely
the last 5,000 years,

00:09:11.146 --> 00:09:14.631
and a lot of these ideas
that came out of Mesopotamia,

00:09:14.631 --> 00:09:17.195
like written codes of
law and the technologies

00:09:17.195 --> 00:09:20.362
and all the rest follow with us today.
