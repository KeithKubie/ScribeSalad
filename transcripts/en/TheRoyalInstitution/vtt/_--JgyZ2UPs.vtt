00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:04.030
Since the late 1950s humans have been sending
stuff into space.

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:08.280
Some of those things came back to Earth, and
some didn't.

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.880
And it's stuff that got left behind that concerns
people like Hugh Lewis.

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.793
I'm an engineer and I come from the

00:00:13.793 --> 00:00:15.160
University of Southampton

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:19.269
and I've been looking at the space debris
problem for over a decade.

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:23.109
And that space debris problem he's just mentioned
- it's a big one.

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:27.641
To give you an idea of the scale, there are
close to 18,000 artificial objects that are

00:00:27.641 --> 00:00:29.689
currently being tracked orbiting our planet.

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:34.860
Out of this, only around 1,400 are operational
satellites.

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.860
Estimates suggest that there are also a further
170 Million objects that are too small to

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:40.860
be tracked.

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.460
The thing about space debris, and we're
talking about artificial space debris,

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.080
is that humans have put it there.

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:49.890
So it's everything that we would put onto
a launch vehicle.

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.100
It could include the satellites themselves.

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.550
The stage of the rocket is often left behind
on orbit.

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:59.670
And then you start to see other bits and pieces,
some lens covers from instruments that are

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.160
looking down at the Earth or looking out into
space.

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:08.020
Astronauts have lost everything from spatulas
to fully equipped tool bags.

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.740
This is NASA astronaut Suni Williams losing
her camera in 2007.

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:16.260
Suni, your camera is behind you.

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:20.740
I hope it's tethered because it looks
like it's passing underneath the arm.

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:22.540
It's not.

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:27.320
And the only real way of getting
rid of this junk is with our atmosphere.

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.719
The lower we are in altitude, the greater
the density of the atmosphere.

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:36.000
This creates drag, which slows the object
down and allows it to fall to Earth,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.899
burning up in our atmosphere as it does.

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:42.630
As you move away in altitude, so you get higher,
those objects,

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.640
they are not going to experience
the same amount of drag.

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:50.480
So if you take a typical satellite at around
about 700-800km altitude,

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:52.980
it's going to be up there for centuries.

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:57.560
The American Vanguard 1 satellite was launched
back in 1958.

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:02.240
It is currently the oldest piece of artificial
space junk orbiting the planet.

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.299
And it's estimated to be stuck in orbit for
another 250 years.

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:10.440
And as more of this debris accumulates, there's
a real risk of them colliding.

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:17.020
Each collision would generate fragments which
would then go on and potentially hit other things.

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:22.140
So if you have enough big objects there
then the worry is that

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.750
you'll end up with what is known as a collision
cascade.

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.890
One collision just feeds the next and so on.

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:31.360
This doomsday scenario actually has a name
- it's called the Kessler syndrome.

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:36.640
And it was first outlined in the late 1970s
by a NASA scientist called Don Kessler.

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.420
Don essentially calculated how many objects
you would need

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:43.460
in particular regions of space in order for
that to take place.

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:47.840
And the worrying fact is that we've actually
exceeded that number of objects

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:50.970
in some regions of space around the Earth.

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.560
Even the smallest objects pose a real risk.

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:56.810
This is a small crack in the window
of the International Space Station

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:01.560
caused by a tiny paint fragment travelling
at around 17,000 miles per hour.

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:09.599
And even if you forget about space exploration,
our day to day lives rely on satellites

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:13.090
for things like communications, security and
weather.

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:17.650
And we start to lose those. At first it would
be one every so often.

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.010
Then it would start to grow, it propagates
through and we start to see,

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:24.739
OK, so our weather satellites are no longer
providing us with information.

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:29.299
It's like stepping back in history to before
the space age

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:33.019
because we fundamentally have these services
embedded

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:35.840
in pretty much everything we do on a day to
day basis.

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:38.380
OK, so what can we do?

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:42.760
Removing all that debris in space is probably
beyond our capabilities at the moment.

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:47.170
So we need to be realistic in the types of
objects that we can remove.

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:50.100
And you typically find those objects are going
to be the big ones.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.739
Because if they were to be hit they generate
lots of fragments

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:56.599
so you want to take those out of the environment.

00:03:56.599 --> 00:03:58.159
And there are a couple of methods.

00:03:58.159 --> 00:04:01.569
You could use a giant robotic arm to grab
the piece of junk.

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:03.140
You could throw a net over it.

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:07.760
Or you could even use a laser to destabilise
its orbit and push it down to Earth.

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:13.020
But there's another problem and it's a biggie.

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:17.340
There's an outer space treaty that the United
Nations produced.

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:23.520
And part of that treaty is, it says that we
can't deploy weapons in space.

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:29.520
Any mission that you could fly that would
remove a bit of junk, you can also remove

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:30.820
somebody's active satellite.

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:37.520
So having a system that is able to remove
debris but also could be considered a weapon

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:38.800
is a bit of a problem.

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:44.440
The barriers to solving this problem aren't
due to limitations in technology or engineering,

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:48.100
but in the way that we as people organise
ourselves.

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:51.440
You have to be a little bit more than an engineer.

00:04:51.449 --> 00:04:55.800
Helping people understand the problem fundamentally
is what you've got to do first.

00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:00.360
Helping them to understand that it's going
to affect them in some way unless we take action.

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:03.440
And I think that's what we really ought to
be doing.

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:06.580
Not just with the space debris problem but
with many others as well.
