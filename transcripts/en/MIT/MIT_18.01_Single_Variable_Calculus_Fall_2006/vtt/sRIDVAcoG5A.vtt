00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:25.020
PROFESSOR: Today we're going
to keep on going

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:30.660
with related rates.

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.600
And you may recall that last
time we were in the middle of

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.000
a problem with this geometry.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.260
There was a right triangle.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.190
There was a road.

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:47.000
Which was going this way,
from right to left.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.830
And the police were up here,
monitoring the situation.

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:55.990
30 feet from the road.

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:59.990
And you're here.

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:04.370
And you're heading this way.

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:06.525
Maybe it's a two lane highway,
but anyway it's only going

00:01:06.525 --> 00:01:07.680
this direction.

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.670
And this distance was 50 feet.

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:17.320
So, because you're moving, this
distance is varying and

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.120
so we gave it a letter.

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:21.900
And, similarly, your distance
to the foot of the

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.050
perpendicular with the
road is also varying.

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:29.890
At this instant it's 40, because
this is a 3, 4, 5

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:31.570
right triangle.

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:35.830
So this was the situation that
we were in last time.

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:38.090
And we're going to pick
up where we left off.

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:50.860
The question is, are you
speeding if the rate of change

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:56.510
of D with respect to t is
80 feet per second.

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:00.680
Now, technically that would be
- 80, because you're going

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.030
towards the policemen.

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.530
Alright, so D is shrinking
at a rate of

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:10.550
- 80 feet per second.

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:16.910
And I remind you that 95 feet
per second is approximately

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:17.660
the speed limit.

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.370
Which is 65 miles per hour.

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.850
So, again, this is where
we were last time.

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:30.150
And, got a little question
mark there.

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.140
And so let's solve
this problem.

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.480
So, this is the setup.

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:38.880
There's a right triangle.

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.290
So there's a relationship
between these lengths.

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:49.800
And the relationship is that
x ^2 + 30 ^2 = D ^2.

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:54.020
So that's the first relationship
that we have. And

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:55.700
the second relationship
that we have, we've

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:57.380
already written down.

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:08.620
Which is dx / dt - oops, sorry.
dD / dt = minus 80.

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:14.920
Now, the idea here is relatively
straightforward.

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.790
We just want to use
differentiation.

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:25.810
Now, you could solve for x.

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:31.580
Alright, x is the square root
of D^2 - 30 squared.

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:32.820
That's one possibility.

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:36.060
But this is basically
a waste of time.

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:37.810
It's a waste of your time.

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:45.550
So it's easier, or easiest, to
follow this method of implicit

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:47.380
differentiation, which
I want to encourage

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:49.080
you to get used to.

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:51.490
Namely, we just differentiate
this equation

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:53.460
with respect to time.

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:56.050
Now, when you do that, you have
to remember that you are

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:59.120
not allowed to plug
in a constant.

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:01.110
Namely 40, for t.

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:03.070
You have to keep in mind what's
really going on in this

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:05.670
problem which is that x is
moving, it's changing.

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:07.250
And D is also changing.

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:10.380
So you have to differentiate
first before

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:12.030
you plug in the values.

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:15.610
So the easiest thing is to use,
in this case, implicit

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:20.130
differentiation.

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:33.000
And if I do that, I get 2x dx /
dt is equal to 2D (dD / dt).

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.910
No more DDT left.

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:36.640
We hope.

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:39.160
Except in this blackboard.

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:40.690
So there's our situation.

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:48.070
Now, if I just plug in,
now I can plug in.

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:52.820
In values. so this is after
taking the derivative.

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:55.750
And, indeed, we have here 2
times the value for x which is

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:57.500
40 at this instant.

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:01.070
And then we have dx / dt.

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:07.510
And that's equal to 2
(D), which is 50.

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:12.900
And then dD / dt is - 80.

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:19.180
So the 80's cancel and we
see that dv / dt = -

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:21.660
100 feet per second.

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:27.340
And so the answer to the
question is yes.

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:30.770
Although you probably wouldn't
be pulled over for this much

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:32.540
of a violation.

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:36.470
So that's, right, it's more than
65 miles an hour, by a

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:41.190
little bit.

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:43.380
So that's the end of
this question.

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:46.460
And usually in these rate of
change or related rates

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:48.530
questions, this is considered
to be the answer to the

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:53.530
question, if you like.

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:55.600
So that's one example.

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:58.960
I'm going to give one more
example before we go on to

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:04.560
some other applications implicit
differentiation.

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:11.520
So my second example is going
to be, you have a it is a

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:17.250
conical tank.

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:26.640
With top of radius 4
feet, let's say.

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:31.770
And depth 10 feet.

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:34.710
So that's our situation.

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:37.730
And then it's being
filled with water.

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:42.830
So, is being filled
with water.

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:49.900
At 2 cubic feet per minute.

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:52.980
So there is our situation.

00:06:52.980 --> 00:07:07.580
And then the question is, how
fast is the water rising when

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:15.040
it is at depth 5 feet?

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:19.670
So if this thing is half-full
in the sense, well not

00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:21.770
half-full in terms
of total volume.

00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:29.160
But half-full in terms of
height, what's the speed at

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:36.540
which the water is rising.

00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:39.970
So, how do we set up
problems like this?

00:07:39.970 --> 00:07:42.240
Well, we talked about
this last time.

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:51.780
The first step is to set up
a diagram and variables.

00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:54.450
And I'm just going to
draw the picture.

00:07:54.450 --> 00:07:58.320
And I'm actually going to
draw the picture twice.

00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:01.590
So here's the conical tank.

00:08:01.590 --> 00:08:05.040
And we have this radius,
which is 4.

00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:07.970
And we have this height,
which is 10.

00:08:07.970 --> 00:08:10.950
So that's just to allow me to
think about this problem.

00:08:10.950 --> 00:08:18.730
Now, it turns out because we
have a varying depth and so

00:08:18.730 --> 00:08:21.730
on, and this is just the top.

00:08:21.730 --> 00:08:24.530
That I'd better depict also the
level at which the water

00:08:24.530 --> 00:08:26.700
actually is at present.

00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:30.890
And furthermore, it's better to
do this schematically, as

00:08:30.890 --> 00:08:31.830
you'll see.

00:08:31.830 --> 00:08:38.200
So the key point here is to
draw this triangle here.

00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:45.230
Which shows me the 10 and shows
me the 4, over here.

00:08:45.230 --> 00:08:48.290
And then imagine that I'm
filling it partway.

00:08:48.290 --> 00:08:50.550
So maybe we'll put that
water level in in

00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:52.400
another color here.

00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:54.370
So here's the water level.

00:08:54.370 --> 00:08:57.840
And the water level, I'm going
to depict that horizontal

00:08:57.840 --> 00:08:59.770
distance here, as r.

00:08:59.770 --> 00:09:00.950
That's going to be
my variable.

00:09:00.950 --> 00:09:04.150
That's the radius of the
top of the water.

00:09:04.150 --> 00:09:06.980
So I'm taking a cross-section
of this, because that

00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:10.230
geometrically the only thing
I have to keep track of.

00:09:10.230 --> 00:09:11.820
At least initially.

00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:14.630
So this is our water level.

00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:18.540
And it's really rotated
around.

00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:23.130
But I'm depicting just this one
half-slice of the picture.

00:09:23.130 --> 00:09:26.300
And then similarly,
I have the height.

00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:30.390
Which is this dimension there.

00:09:30.390 --> 00:09:32.570
Or, if you like, the
depth of the water.

00:09:32.570 --> 00:09:42.140
So the water has filled us up,
up to this point here.

00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:46.850
So I set it up this way so that
it's clear that we have

00:09:46.850 --> 00:09:47.450
two triangles here.

00:09:47.450 --> 00:09:50.210
And that one piece of
information we can get from

00:09:50.210 --> 00:09:53.880
the geometry is the similar
triangles information.

00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:59.870
Namely, that r / h = 4 / 10.

00:09:59.870 --> 00:10:09.950
So this is by far the most
typical geometric fact that

00:10:09.950 --> 00:10:13.450
you'll have to glean
from a picture.

00:10:13.450 --> 00:10:17.280
So that's one piece of
information that we get from

00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:18.920
this picture.

00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:23.250
Now, the second thing we have
to do is set up formulas for

00:10:23.250 --> 00:10:26.470
the volume of water,
and then figure out

00:10:26.470 --> 00:10:27.330
what's going on here.

00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:33.460
So the volume of water
is, of a cone.

00:10:33.460 --> 00:10:37.360
So again, you have to know
something about geometry to do

00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:40.290
many of these problems. So you
have to know that the volume

00:10:40.290 --> 00:10:44.500
of a cone is 1/3 base
times height.

00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:45.900
Now, this one is upside down.

00:10:45.900 --> 00:10:50.020
The base is on the top and it's
going down but it works

00:10:50.020 --> 00:10:50.720
the same way.

00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:52.270
That doesn't affect volume.

00:10:52.270 --> 00:10:57.450
So it's 1/3 and the base is
pi r^2, that's the base.

00:10:57.450 --> 00:11:01.890
And times h, which
is the height.

00:11:01.890 --> 00:11:06.290
So this is the setup
for this problem.

00:11:06.290 --> 00:11:12.270
And now, having our
relationship, we have one

00:11:12.270 --> 00:11:14.580
relationship left that
we have to remember.

00:11:14.580 --> 00:11:15.920
Because we have one
more piece of

00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:17.630
information in this problem.

00:11:17.630 --> 00:11:20.990
Namely, how fast the
volume is changing.

00:11:20.990 --> 00:11:22.960
It's going at 2 cubic
feet per minute.

00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:29.740
It's increasing, so that
means that dv / dt = 2.

00:11:29.740 --> 00:11:35.340
So I've now gotten rid of all
the words and I have only

00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:38.010
formulas left.

00:11:38.010 --> 00:11:43.960
I started here with the words,
I drew some pictures, and I

00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:44.740
derived some formulas.

00:11:44.740 --> 00:11:46.200
Actually, there's one
thing missing.

00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:49.930
What's missing?

00:11:49.930 --> 00:11:52.570
Yeah.

00:11:52.570 --> 00:11:57.230
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:11:57.230 --> 00:11:57.740
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

00:11:57.740 --> 00:11:58.420
What you want to find.

00:11:58.420 --> 00:12:00.690
What I left out is
the question.

00:12:00.690 --> 00:12:15.110
So the question is, what
is dh / dt when h = 5?

00:12:15.110 --> 00:12:20.600
So that's the question here.

00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:22.630
Now, we've got the whole problem
and we never have to

00:12:22.630 --> 00:12:25.510
look at it again if you like.

00:12:25.510 --> 00:12:32.610
We just have to pay attention
to this piece here.

00:12:32.610 --> 00:12:34.780
So let's carry it out.

00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:36.870
So what happens here.

00:12:36.870 --> 00:12:39.190
So look, you could do this by
implicit differentiation.

00:12:39.190 --> 00:12:43.180
But it's so easy to express r
as a function of h that that

00:12:43.180 --> 00:12:44.560
seems kind of foolish.

00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:48.900
So let's write r as 2/5 h.

00:12:48.900 --> 00:12:51.280
That's coming from this
first equation here.

00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:53.800
And then let's substitute
that in.

00:12:53.800 --> 00:13:04.810
That means that v = 1/3
pi ( 2/5 h^2) h.

00:13:04.810 --> 00:13:06.630
And now I have to differentiate
that.

00:13:06.630 --> 00:13:08.850
So now I will use implicit
differentiation.

00:13:08.850 --> 00:13:12.200
It's very foolish at this point
to take cube roots to

00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:13.320
solve for h.

00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:16.080
You just get yourself into
a bunch of junk.

00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:18.580
So there is a stage at which
we're still using implicit

00:13:18.580 --> 00:13:19.490
differentiation here.

00:13:19.490 --> 00:13:24.780
I'm not going to try to solve
for h as a function of v.

00:13:24.780 --> 00:13:26.700
Instead I'm just differentiating
straight out

00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:28.620
from this formula, which
is relatively easy to

00:13:28.620 --> 00:13:29.530
differentiate.

00:13:29.530 --> 00:13:36.210
So this is dv / dt, which
of course = 2 and if I

00:13:36.210 --> 00:13:39.640
differentiate it I just get this
constant, pi / 3, this

00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:42.390
other constant, (2/5)^2.

00:13:42.390 --> 00:13:45.200
And then I have to differentiate
h^3.

00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:47.290
(h^2)h.

00:13:47.290 --> 00:13:53.140
So that's 3h^2 ( dh / dt).

00:13:53.140 --> 00:13:59.760
That's the chain rule.

00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:02.080
So now let's plug in
all of our numbers.

00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:07.110
Again, the other theme is, you
don't plug in numbers, fixed

00:14:07.110 --> 00:14:09.600
numbers, until everything
has stopped moving.

00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:11.640
At this point, we've
already calculated

00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:12.790
our rates of change.

00:14:12.790 --> 00:14:14.140
So now I can put
in the numbers.

00:14:14.140 --> 00:14:26.010
So, 2 = pi 3 ( 2/5)^2( 3), and
then h was 5, so this is 5^2.

00:14:26.010 --> 00:14:27.870
And then I have dh / dt.

00:14:27.870 --> 00:14:31.600
There's only one unknown thing
left in this problem,

00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:32.560
which is dh / dt.

00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:33.990
Everything else is a number.

00:14:33.990 --> 00:14:36.800
And if you do all the
cancellations, you see that

00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:38.210
this cancels this.

00:14:38.210 --> 00:14:41.280
One of the 2's cancels - well,
this cancels this.

00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:42.690
And then one of the
2's cancels that.

00:14:42.690 --> 00:14:54.080
So all-told what we have here
is that dh / dt = 1 / 2 pi.

00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:58.700
And so that happens to
be feet per second.

00:14:58.700 --> 00:15:04.610
This is the whole story.

00:15:04.610 --> 00:15:05.680
Questions, way back there.

00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:10.040
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:11.630
PROFESSOR: Where did I get --
the question is where did I

00:15:11.630 --> 00:15:14.590
get r = 2/5 h from.

00:15:14.590 --> 00:15:17.680
The answer was, it came from
similar triangles,

00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:19.020
which is over here.

00:15:19.020 --> 00:15:20.380
I did this similar
triangle thing.

00:15:20.380 --> 00:15:26.280
And I got this relationship
here. r / h = 4/10, but then I

00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:31.790
canceled it, got 2/5 and
brought the h over.

00:15:31.790 --> 00:15:32.890
Another question, over here.

00:15:32.890 --> 00:15:45.470
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:15:45.470 --> 00:15:53.100
PROFESSOR: The question
was the following.

00:15:53.100 --> 00:15:56.020
Suppose you're at this
stage, can you write

00:15:56.020 --> 00:15:58.310
from here dv / dh.

00:15:58.310 --> 00:15:59.560
So, suppose you're here.

00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:01.390
And work out what this is.

00:16:01.390 --> 00:16:05.030
It's going to end up being
some constant times h^2.

00:16:05.030 --> 00:16:14.990
And then also use dv / dt
= dv / dh ( dh / dt).

00:16:14.990 --> 00:16:17.520
Which the chain rule.

00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:20.830
And the answer is yes.

00:16:20.830 --> 00:16:24.500
We can do that, and indeed
that is what my

00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:26.310
next sentence is.

00:16:26.310 --> 00:16:27.750
That's exactly what
I'm saying.

00:16:27.750 --> 00:16:30.240
So when I said this
- sorry, when you

00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:32.780
said this, I did that.

00:16:32.780 --> 00:16:34.080
That's exactly what I did.

00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:41.110
This chunk is exactly dv / dh.

00:16:41.110 --> 00:16:43.390
That's just what I'm doing.

00:16:43.390 --> 00:16:44.730
OK.

00:16:44.730 --> 00:16:48.750
So, definitely, that's
what I had in mind.

00:16:48.750 --> 00:16:49.760
Yeah, another question.

00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:55.280
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:16:55.280 --> 00:16:56.730
PROFESSOR: You're asking
me whether my

00:16:56.730 --> 00:16:58.040
arithmetic is right or not?

00:16:58.040 --> 00:17:03.890
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:17:03.890 --> 00:17:06.850
PROFESSOR: Pi - per second.

00:17:06.850 --> 00:17:07.350
Oh.

00:17:07.350 --> 00:17:09.480
This should - no, OK, right.

00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:11.560
I guess it's per minute.

00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:12.890
Since the other one
is per minute.

00:17:12.890 --> 00:17:14.400
Thank you.

00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:16.810
Yes.

00:17:16.810 --> 00:17:17.880
Was there another question?

00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:21.810
Probably also fixing my
seconds to minutes.

00:17:21.810 --> 00:17:23.150
Way back there.

00:17:23.150 --> 00:17:26.601
STUDENT: I don't understand,
why did you

00:17:26.601 --> 00:17:27.490
have to do all that.

00:17:27.490 --> 00:17:30.930
Isn't the speed 2 cubic
feet per minute?

00:17:30.930 --> 00:17:34.020
PROFESSOR: The speed at which
you're filling it is 2 cubic

00:17:34.020 --> 00:17:37.540
feet, but the water level is
rising at a different rate,

00:17:37.540 --> 00:17:40.350
depending on whether you're
low down or high up.

00:17:40.350 --> 00:17:44.220
It depends on how wide the
pond, the surface, is.

00:17:44.220 --> 00:17:45.310
So in fact it's not.

00:17:45.310 --> 00:17:48.950
In fact, the answer wasn't
2 cubic - it wasn't.

00:17:48.950 --> 00:17:49.900
There's a rate there.

00:17:49.900 --> 00:17:52.090
That is, that's how much
volume is being added.

00:17:52.090 --> 00:17:54.250
But then there's another number
that we're keeping

00:17:54.250 --> 00:17:55.780
track of, which is the height.

00:17:55.780 --> 00:17:58.790
Or, if you like, the
depth of the water.

00:17:58.790 --> 00:18:00.030
OK.

00:18:00.030 --> 00:18:01.750
So this is the whole point
about related rates.

00:18:01.750 --> 00:18:03.850
Is you have one variable,
which is v, which

00:18:03.850 --> 00:18:05.360
is volume of something.

00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:07.010
You have another variable,
which is h, which is the

00:18:07.010 --> 00:18:10.750
height of the cone
of water there.

00:18:10.750 --> 00:18:12.260
And you're keeping track
of one variable in

00:18:12.260 --> 00:18:13.300
terms of the other.

00:18:13.300 --> 00:18:16.360
And the relationship will always
be a chain rule type of

00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:17.140
relationship.

00:18:17.140 --> 00:18:19.110
So, therefore, you'll be able to
- if you know one you'll be

00:18:19.110 --> 00:18:20.810
able to figure out the other.

00:18:20.810 --> 00:18:22.890
Provided you get all of
the related rates.

00:18:22.890 --> 00:18:24.530
These are what are called
related rates.

00:18:24.530 --> 00:18:26.010
This is a rate of something
with respect to

00:18:26.010 --> 00:18:28.050
something, etc. etc.

00:18:28.050 --> 00:18:30.540
So it's really all about
the chain rule.

00:18:30.540 --> 00:18:40.980
And just fitting it to word
problems. So there's a couple

00:18:40.980 --> 00:18:41.900
of examples.

00:18:41.900 --> 00:18:44.430
And I'll let you work
out some more.

00:18:44.430 --> 00:18:50.870
So now, the next thing that I
want to do is to give you one

00:18:50.870 --> 00:18:54.080
more max-min problem.

00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:58.740
Which has to do with this
device, which I

00:18:58.740 --> 00:19:00.400
brought with me.

00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:02.480
So this is a ring.

00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:05.900
Happens to be a napkin ring,
and this is some parachute

00:19:05.900 --> 00:19:09.450
string, which I use when
I go backpacking.

00:19:09.450 --> 00:19:15.890
And the question is if you have
a - you think of this is

00:19:15.890 --> 00:19:17.090
a weight, it's flexible.

00:19:17.090 --> 00:19:19.040
It's allowed to move
along here.

00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:23.480
And the question is, if I fix
these two ends where my two

00:19:23.480 --> 00:19:26.400
hands are, where my right hand
is here and where my left hand

00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:28.410
is over there.

00:19:28.410 --> 00:19:32.500
And the question is, where does
this ring settle down.

00:19:32.500 --> 00:19:35.530
Now, it's obvious, or should be
maybe obvious, is that if

00:19:35.530 --> 00:19:39.060
my two hands are at equal
heights, it should settle in

00:19:39.060 --> 00:19:41.420
the middle.

00:19:41.420 --> 00:19:44.020
The question that we're trying
to resolve is what if one hand

00:19:44.020 --> 00:19:47.290
is a little higher
than the other.

00:19:47.290 --> 00:19:49.040
What happens, or if
the other way.

00:19:49.040 --> 00:19:52.370
Where does it settle down?

00:19:52.370 --> 00:19:55.720
So in order to depict this
problem properly, I need two

00:19:55.720 --> 00:19:57.480
volunteers to help me out.

00:19:57.480 --> 00:20:00.400
Can I have some help?

00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:03.370
OK.

00:20:03.370 --> 00:20:06.320
So I need one of you to hold the
right side, and one of you

00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:08.460
to hold the left side.

00:20:08.460 --> 00:20:09.260
OK.

00:20:09.260 --> 00:20:11.180
And just hold it against
the blackboard.

00:20:11.180 --> 00:20:12.240
We're going to trace.

00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:15.680
So stick it about here, in
the middle somewhere.

00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:17.440
And now we want to make sure
that this one is a little

00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:18.960
higher, alright?

00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:22.430
So we'll have to - yeah, let's
get a little higher up.

00:20:22.430 --> 00:20:25.730
That's probably good enough.

00:20:25.730 --> 00:20:29.770
So the experiment
has been done.

00:20:29.770 --> 00:20:31.100
We now see where
this thing is.

00:20:31.100 --> 00:20:33.810
But, so now hold on tight.

00:20:33.810 --> 00:20:35.960
This thing stretches.

00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:38.200
So we want to get it stretched
so that we can

00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:40.960
see what it is properly.

00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:43.000
So this thing isn't heavy enough
for this demonstration.

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:46.480
I should've had a ten-ton
brick attached there.

00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:50.230
But if I did that, than I would
tax my, right, I would

00:20:50.230 --> 00:20:52.090
tax your abilities to.

00:20:52.090 --> 00:20:54.400
Right, so we're going to try
to trace out what the

00:20:54.400 --> 00:21:03.810
possibilities are here.

00:21:03.810 --> 00:21:06.990
So this is, roughly speaking,
where this thing - and so now

00:21:06.990 --> 00:21:07.960
where does it settle.

00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:10.550
Well, it settles about here.

00:21:10.550 --> 00:21:12.630
So we're going to put that
as x marks the spot.

00:21:12.630 --> 00:21:15.900
OK, thank you very much.

00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:18.230
Got to remember where
those dots --

00:21:18.230 --> 00:21:20.960
OK, all right.

00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:24.040
Sorry, I forgot to
mark the spots.

00:21:24.040 --> 00:21:27.410
OK, so here's the situation.

00:21:27.410 --> 00:21:29.860
We have a problem.

00:21:29.860 --> 00:21:33.170
And we've hung a string.

00:21:33.170 --> 00:21:39.630
And it went down like this and
then it went like that.

00:21:39.630 --> 00:21:43.710
And we discovered where
it settled.

00:21:43.710 --> 00:21:44.750
Physically.

00:21:44.750 --> 00:21:47.820
So we want to explain this
mathematically, and see what's

00:21:47.820 --> 00:21:49.280
going on with this problem.

00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:50.940
So this is a real-life
problem.

00:21:50.940 --> 00:21:53.240
It honestly is the problem you
have to solve if you want to

00:21:53.240 --> 00:21:54.000
build a bridge.

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:55.570
Like, a suspension bridge.

00:21:55.570 --> 00:21:58.130
This, among many problems.
It's a very serious and

00:21:58.130 --> 00:21:59.350
important problem.

00:21:59.350 --> 00:22:02.940
And this is the simplest
one of this type.

00:22:02.940 --> 00:22:04.990
So we've got our shape here.

00:22:04.990 --> 00:22:07.770
This should be a straight
line, maybe not quite as

00:22:07.770 --> 00:22:10.920
angled as that.

00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:13.520
The first, we've already drawn
the diagram and we've more or

00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:16.010
less visualized what's
going on here.

00:22:16.010 --> 00:22:21.460
But the first step after the
diagram is to give letters.

00:22:21.460 --> 00:22:24.630
Is to label things
appropriately.

00:22:24.630 --> 00:22:27.270
And I do not expect you
to be able to do

00:22:27.270 --> 00:22:29.170
this, at this stage.

00:22:29.170 --> 00:22:31.390
Because it requires a
lot of experience.

00:22:31.390 --> 00:22:33.040
But I'm going to
do it for you.

00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:34.630
We're going to just do that.

00:22:34.630 --> 00:22:37.390
So the simplest thing
to do is to use the

00:22:37.390 --> 00:22:39.800
coordinates of the plane.

00:22:39.800 --> 00:22:43.750
And if you do that, it's also
easiest to use the origin.

00:22:43.750 --> 00:22:46.590
My favorite number is 0 and
it should be yours, too.

00:22:46.590 --> 00:22:51.420
So we're going to make
this point be (0, 0).

00:22:51.420 --> 00:22:54.550
Now, there's another fixed
point in this problem.

00:22:54.550 --> 00:22:57.200
And it's this point over here.

00:22:57.200 --> 00:22:58.880
And we don't know what
its coordinates are.

00:22:58.880 --> 00:23:00.850
So we're just going to give
them letters, a and b.

00:23:00.850 --> 00:23:02.790
But those letters are
going to be fixed

00:23:02.790 --> 00:23:06.110
numbers in this problem.

00:23:06.110 --> 00:23:08.840
And we want to solve it for
all possible a's and b's.

00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:11.400
Now, the interesting thing,
remember, is what happens when

00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:12.630
b Is not 0.

00:23:12.630 --> 00:23:16.250
If b = 0, we already have a clue
that the point should be

00:23:16.250 --> 00:23:16.950
the center point.

00:23:16.950 --> 00:23:19.440
It should be exactly that x,
the middle point, which I'm

00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:22.730
going to label in a second,
is halfway in between.

00:23:22.730 --> 00:23:25.930
So now the variable point that
I'm going to use is down here.

00:23:25.930 --> 00:23:30.220
I'm going to call this
point (x, y).

00:23:30.220 --> 00:23:31.600
So here's my setup.

00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:34.760
I've now given labels
to all the things on

00:23:34.760 --> 00:23:37.800
the diagram so far.

00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:42.260
Most of the things
on the diagram.

00:23:42.260 --> 00:23:47.700
So now, what else
do I have to do?

00:23:47.700 --> 00:23:54.930
Well, I have to explain
to you that this is a

00:23:54.930 --> 00:23:56.850
minimization problem.

00:23:56.850 --> 00:24:01.270
What happens, actually,
physically is that the weight

00:24:01.270 --> 00:24:03.050
settles to the lowest point.

00:24:03.050 --> 00:24:05.820
That's the thing that has the
lowest potential energy.

00:24:05.820 --> 00:24:09.370
So we're minimizing
a function.

00:24:09.370 --> 00:24:13.260
And it's this curve here.

00:24:13.260 --> 00:24:17.000
The constraint is that we're
restricted to this curve.

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:18.660
So this is a constraint curve.

00:24:18.660 --> 00:24:24.590
And we want the lowest
point of this curve.

00:24:24.590 --> 00:24:29.160
So now, we need a little bit
more language in order to

00:24:29.160 --> 00:24:31.180
describe what it is
that we've got.

00:24:31.180 --> 00:24:36.500
And the constraint curve, we
got it in a particular way.

00:24:36.500 --> 00:24:39.320
Namely, we strung some string
from here to there.

00:24:39.320 --> 00:24:41.980
And what happens at all these
points is that the total

00:24:41.980 --> 00:24:45.920
length of the string
is the same.

00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:49.300
So one way of expressing the
constraint is that the length

00:24:49.300 --> 00:24:52.270
of the string is constant.

00:24:52.270 --> 00:24:54.690
And so in order to figure out
what the constraint is, what

00:24:54.690 --> 00:24:58.120
this curve is, I have to
describe that analytically.

00:24:58.120 --> 00:25:01.830
And I'm going to do that by
drawing in some helping lines.

00:25:01.830 --> 00:25:03.720
Namely, some right triangles
to figure out

00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:05.400
what this length is.

00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:07.290
And what the other length is.

00:25:07.290 --> 00:25:09.550
So this length is pretty
easy if I draw a

00:25:09.550 --> 00:25:11.410
right triangle here.

00:25:11.410 --> 00:25:14.410
Because we go over x
and we go down y.

00:25:14.410 --> 00:25:19.150
So this length is the square
root of x^2 + y^2.

00:25:19.150 --> 00:25:22.420
That's the Pythagorean
theorem.

00:25:22.420 --> 00:25:26.200
Similarly, over here, I'm going
to get another length.

00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:28.360
Which is a little
bit of a mess.

00:25:28.360 --> 00:25:30.670
It's the vertical.

00:25:30.670 --> 00:25:35.290
So I'm just going to label one
half of it, so that you see.

00:25:35.290 --> 00:25:38.600
So this horizontal
distance is x.

00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:41.810
And this horizontal distance
from this top point with this

00:25:41.810 --> 00:25:44.000
right angle, over there.

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:47.660
It starts at x and ends at a.

00:25:47.660 --> 00:25:50.820
The right-most point is
a in the x coordinate.

00:25:50.820 --> 00:25:56.150
So the whole distance
is a - x.

00:25:56.150 --> 00:26:00.700
So that's this leg of
this right triangle.

00:26:00.700 --> 00:26:05.770
And, similarly, the vertical
distance will be b - y.

00:26:05.770 --> 00:26:08.300
And so, the formula here, which
is a little complicated

00:26:08.300 --> 00:26:17.160
for this length, is the square
root of (a - x)^2 + (b - y)^2.

00:26:17.160 --> 00:26:21.430
So here are the two formulas
that are going to allow me to

00:26:21.430 --> 00:26:22.460
set up my problem now.

00:26:22.460 --> 00:26:24.450
So, my goal is to set
it up the way I did

00:26:24.450 --> 00:26:26.940
here, just with formulas.

00:26:26.940 --> 00:26:40.590
And not with diagrams
and not with names.

00:26:40.590 --> 00:26:42.910
So here's what I'd like to do.

00:26:42.910 --> 00:26:46.190
I claim that what's constrained,
if I'm along that

00:26:46.190 --> 00:26:48.910
curve, is that the total
length is constant.

00:26:48.910 --> 00:26:50.730
So that's this statement here.

00:26:50.730 --> 00:26:55.830
The square root of x^2 + y^2
+ this other square root.

00:26:55.830 --> 00:27:02.360
These are the two lengths
of string.

00:27:02.360 --> 00:27:08.210
Is equal to some number,
L, which is constant.

00:27:08.210 --> 00:27:16.040
And this, as I said, is what
I'm calling my constraint.

00:27:16.040 --> 00:27:16.290
Yeah.

00:27:16.290 --> 00:27:20.480
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:27:20.480 --> 00:27:24.750
PROFESSOR: So the question is,
shouldn't it be b plus y.

00:27:24.750 --> 00:27:28.210
No, and the reason is that
y is a negative number.

00:27:28.210 --> 00:27:30.300
It's below 0.

00:27:30.300 --> 00:27:39.210
So it's actually the sum, -
y is a positive number.

00:27:39.210 --> 00:27:43.840
Alright, so here's
the formula.

00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:53.000
And then, we want to find the
minimum of something.

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:56.250
So what is it that we're
finding the minimum of?

00:27:56.250 --> 00:27:58.370
This is actually the hardest
part of the problem,

00:27:58.370 --> 00:27:59.030
conceptually.

00:27:59.030 --> 00:28:01.610
I tried to prepare it,
but it's very hard

00:28:01.610 --> 00:28:02.650
to figure this out.

00:28:02.650 --> 00:28:07.540
We're finding the least what?

00:28:07.540 --> 00:28:10.740
It's y.

00:28:10.740 --> 00:28:11.830
We got a name for that.

00:28:11.830 --> 00:28:17.220
So we want to find
the lowest y.

00:28:17.220 --> 00:28:20.050
Now, the reason why it seems
a little weird is you might

00:28:20.050 --> 00:28:21.770
think of y as just
being a variable.

00:28:21.770 --> 00:28:25.180
But really, y is a function.

00:28:25.180 --> 00:28:32.800
It's really y = y ( x ) is
defined implicitly by the

00:28:32.800 --> 00:28:34.930
constraint equation.

00:28:34.930 --> 00:28:36.420
That's what that curve is.

00:28:36.420 --> 00:28:42.120
And notice the bottom point is
exactly the place where the

00:28:42.120 --> 00:28:46.160
tangent line will
be horizontal.

00:28:46.160 --> 00:28:48.180
Which is just what we want.

00:28:48.180 --> 00:29:03.600
So from the diagram, the bottom
point is where y' = 0.

00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:15.195
So this is the critical point.

00:29:15.195 --> 00:29:25.720
Yeah?

00:29:25.720 --> 00:29:27.540
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:29:27.540 --> 00:29:28.440
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

00:29:28.440 --> 00:29:32.440
So I'm deriving for you, so the
question is, could I have

00:29:32.440 --> 00:29:35.590
just tried to find y'
= 0 to begin with.

00:29:35.590 --> 00:29:37.390
The answer is yes, absolutely.

00:29:37.390 --> 00:29:39.070
And in fact I'm leading
in that direction.

00:29:39.070 --> 00:29:42.400
I'm just showing you, so I'm
trying to make the following,

00:29:42.400 --> 00:29:43.930
very subtle, point.

00:29:43.930 --> 00:29:49.500
Which is in maximum-minimum
problems, we always have to

00:29:49.500 --> 00:29:51.130
keep track of two things.

00:29:51.130 --> 00:29:55.110
Often the interesting point
is the critical point.

00:29:55.110 --> 00:29:56.840
And that indeed turns out
to be the case here.

00:29:56.840 --> 00:29:59.840
But we always have to
check the ends.

00:29:59.840 --> 00:30:02.125
And so there are several ways
of checking the ends.

00:30:02.125 --> 00:30:03.490
One is, we did this
physical problem.

00:30:03.490 --> 00:30:05.410
We can see that it's
coming up here.

00:30:05.410 --> 00:30:06.610
We can see that it's
coming up here.

00:30:06.610 --> 00:30:10.480
Therefore the bottom must be
at this critical point.

00:30:10.480 --> 00:30:14.140
So that's OK, so that's one
way of checking it.

00:30:14.140 --> 00:30:17.570
Another way of checking it is
the reasoning that I just

00:30:17.570 --> 00:30:19.330
gave. But it's really
the same reasoning.

00:30:19.330 --> 00:30:21.890
I'm pointing to this thing and
I'm showing you that the

00:30:21.890 --> 00:30:23.010
bottom is somewhere
in the middle.

00:30:23.010 --> 00:30:26.470
So, therefore, it is a place
of horizontal tangency.

00:30:26.470 --> 00:30:28.970
That's the reasoning
that I'm using.

00:30:28.970 --> 00:30:32.570
So, again, this is to avoid
having to evaluate a limit of

00:30:32.570 --> 00:30:35.300
an end or to use the second
derivative test, which is a

00:30:35.300 --> 00:30:42.310
total catastrophe in this case.

00:30:42.310 --> 00:30:45.470
OK, now.

00:30:45.470 --> 00:30:48.780
There's one other thing that you
might know about this if

00:30:48.780 --> 00:30:51.580
you've seen this geometric
construction before.

00:30:51.580 --> 00:30:54.300
With a string and chalk.

00:30:54.300 --> 00:30:58.070
Which is that this curve
is an eclipse.

00:30:58.070 --> 00:30:59.750
It turns out, this is a
piece of an eclipse.

00:30:59.750 --> 00:31:00.870
It's a huge ellipse.

00:31:00.870 --> 00:31:02.280
These two points turn
out to be the

00:31:02.280 --> 00:31:05.500
so-called foci of the ellipse.

00:31:05.500 --> 00:31:09.530
However, that geometric fact is
totally useless for solving

00:31:09.530 --> 00:31:10.860
this problem.

00:31:10.860 --> 00:31:12.390
Completely useless.

00:31:12.390 --> 00:31:14.850
If you actually write out the
formulas for the ellipse,

00:31:14.850 --> 00:31:16.740
you'll discover that you
have a much harder

00:31:16.740 --> 00:31:18.090
problem on your hands.

00:31:18.090 --> 00:31:22.460
And it will take you twice or
ten times as long, so, it's

00:31:22.460 --> 00:31:25.670
true that it's an ellipse,
but it doesn't help.

00:31:25.670 --> 00:31:29.510
OK, so what we're going to do
instead is much simpler.

00:31:29.510 --> 00:31:32.660
We're going to leave this
expression along and we're

00:31:32.660 --> 00:31:35.480
just going to differentiate
implicitly.

00:31:35.480 --> 00:31:42.770
So again, we use implicit
differentiation on the

00:31:42.770 --> 00:31:49.430
constraint equation.

00:31:49.430 --> 00:31:51.350
So that's the equation which
is directly above me

00:31:51.350 --> 00:31:54.310
there, at the top.

00:31:54.310 --> 00:31:57.470
And I have to differentiate
it with respect to x.

00:31:57.470 --> 00:31:59.450
So that's a little ugly,
but we've done

00:31:59.450 --> 00:32:01.080
this a few times before.

00:32:01.080 --> 00:32:03.630
When you differentiate a square
root, the square root

00:32:03.630 --> 00:32:08.230
goes into the denominator.

00:32:08.230 --> 00:32:11.500
And there's a factor of 1/2, so
there's a 2x which cancels.

00:32:11.500 --> 00:32:12.750
So I claim it's this.

00:32:12.750 --> 00:32:17.180
Now, because y depends on x,
there's also a y y' here.

00:32:17.180 --> 00:32:21.930
So technically speaking, it's
twice this with a half.

00:32:21.930 --> 00:32:24.310
2 / 2 times that.

00:32:24.310 --> 00:32:26.240
So that's the differentiation
of the first

00:32:26.240 --> 00:32:30.790
piece of this guy.

00:32:30.790 --> 00:32:33.330
Now I'm going to do this second
one, and it's also the

00:32:33.330 --> 00:32:34.060
chain rule.

00:32:34.060 --> 00:32:39.150
But you're just going to have
to let me do it for you.

00:32:39.150 --> 00:32:43.230
Because it's just a little bit
too long for you to pay

00:32:43.230 --> 00:32:43.880
attention to.

00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:46.580
It turns out there's a minus
sign that comes out, because

00:32:46.580 --> 00:32:49.710
there's a - x and a - y there.

00:32:49.710 --> 00:32:52.880
And then the numerator, the
denominator is the same

00:32:52.880 --> 00:32:55.100
massive square root.

00:32:55.100 --> 00:32:59.920
So it's (a - x)^2 ( b - y)^2.

00:32:59.920 --> 00:33:05.830
And the numerator is a
- x, which is what

00:33:05.830 --> 00:33:07.750
replaces the x over here.

00:33:07.750 --> 00:33:13.660
And then another term,
which is (b - y)y'.

00:33:13.660 --> 00:33:15.960
I claim that that's analogous
to what I did

00:33:15.960 --> 00:33:17.140
in the first term.

00:33:17.140 --> 00:33:20.110
And you'll just have to check
this on your own.

00:33:20.110 --> 00:33:21.630
Because I did it too
fast for you to be

00:33:21.630 --> 00:33:23.730
able to check yourself.

00:33:23.730 --> 00:33:25.300
Now, that's going to
be equal to what on

00:33:25.300 --> 00:33:26.190
the right-hand side.

00:33:26.190 --> 00:33:29.510
What's the derivative of
L with respect to x?

00:33:29.510 --> 00:33:30.540
It's 0.

00:33:30.540 --> 00:33:32.300
It's not changing
in the problem.

00:33:32.300 --> 00:33:37.630
Although my parachute
stuff stretches.

00:33:37.630 --> 00:33:40.700
We tried to stretch it to
its fullest extent.

00:33:40.700 --> 00:33:45.100
So that we kept it fixed,
that was the goal here.

00:33:45.100 --> 00:33:50.380
So now, this looks like
a total mess.

00:33:50.380 --> 00:33:52.940
But, it's not.

00:33:52.940 --> 00:33:54.440
And let me show you why.

00:33:54.440 --> 00:33:57.110
It simplifies a great deal.

00:33:57.110 --> 00:34:01.140
And let me show you
exactly how.

00:34:01.140 --> 00:34:04.220
So, first of all, the whole
point is we're looking for the

00:34:04.220 --> 00:34:06.860
place where y' = 0.

00:34:06.860 --> 00:34:14.080
So that means that these
terms go away. y' = 0.

00:34:14.080 --> 00:34:16.690
So they're gone.

00:34:16.690 --> 00:34:21.070
And now what we have is the
following equation.

00:34:21.070 --> 00:34:27.590
It's x / square root of x^2 +
y^2 squared is equal to, if I

00:34:27.590 --> 00:34:30.630
put it on the other side the
minus sign is changed to a

00:34:30.630 --> 00:34:37.130
plus sign. a - x divided by this
other massive object, (a

00:34:37.130 --> 00:34:43.300
- x)^2 + (b - y)^2.

00:34:43.300 --> 00:34:45.510
So this is what it's
simplifies to.

00:34:45.510 --> 00:34:51.020
Now again, that also might
look complicated to you.

00:34:51.020 --> 00:34:57.320
But I claim that this is
something, this is a kind of

00:34:57.320 --> 00:35:01.980
equilibrium equation that can be
interpreted geometrically,

00:35:01.980 --> 00:35:05.360
in a way that is very meaningful
and important.

00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:09.330
So first of all, let me observe
for you that this x is

00:35:09.330 --> 00:35:10.730
something on our picture.

00:35:10.730 --> 00:35:12.760
And the square root
of x^2 + y^2 is

00:35:12.760 --> 00:35:14.160
something on our picture.

00:35:14.160 --> 00:35:19.230
Namely, if I go over to the
picture, here was x and this

00:35:19.230 --> 00:35:20.760
was a right triangle.

00:35:20.760 --> 00:35:25.700
And this hypotenuse was square
root of x^2 + y^2.

00:35:25.700 --> 00:35:31.680
So, if I call this angle
alpha, then this

00:35:31.680 --> 00:35:34.330
is the sine of alpha.

00:35:34.330 --> 00:35:34.700
Right?

00:35:34.700 --> 00:35:36.950
It's a right triangle, that's
the opposite leg.

00:35:36.950 --> 00:35:44.940
So this guy is the
sine of alpha.

00:35:44.940 --> 00:35:48.850
Similarly, the other side has
an interpretation for the

00:35:48.850 --> 00:35:50.800
other right triangle.

00:35:50.800 --> 00:35:56.245
If this angle is beta, then the
opposite side is a - x,

00:35:56.245 --> 00:36:00.850
and the hypotenuse is what was
in the denominator over there.

00:36:00.850 --> 00:36:10.130
So this side is sine of beta.

00:36:10.130 --> 00:36:14.850
And so what this condition
is telling us is

00:36:14.850 --> 00:36:19.230
that alpha = beta.

00:36:19.230 --> 00:36:22.620
Which is the hidden symmetry
in the problem.

00:36:22.620 --> 00:36:25.600
I don't know if you can actually
see it when I show

00:36:25.600 --> 00:36:28.490
you this thing.

00:36:28.490 --> 00:36:33.120
But, no matter how I tilt it,
actually the two angles from

00:36:33.120 --> 00:36:39.330
the horizontal are the same.

00:36:39.330 --> 00:36:41.230
In the middle it's kind
of obvious that that

00:36:41.230 --> 00:36:42.540
should be the case.

00:36:42.540 --> 00:36:44.510
But on the sides it's
not obvious that

00:36:44.510 --> 00:36:46.820
that's what's happening.

00:36:46.820 --> 00:36:49.955
Now, this has even, so that's
a symmetry, if you like, of

00:36:49.955 --> 00:36:50.590
the situation.

00:36:50.590 --> 00:36:52.590
These two angles are equal.

00:36:52.590 --> 00:36:55.440
But there's something
more to be said.

00:36:55.440 --> 00:36:58.870
If you do a forced diagram for
this, what you'll discover is

00:36:58.870 --> 00:37:03.680
that the tension on the
two lines is the same.

00:37:03.680 --> 00:37:05.980
Which means that when you
build something which is

00:37:05.980 --> 00:37:11.350
hanging like this, it will
involve the least stress.

00:37:11.350 --> 00:37:14.340
If you hang something very
heavy, and one side carries

00:37:14.340 --> 00:37:16.700
twice as much load as the other,
then you have twice as

00:37:16.700 --> 00:37:19.260
much chance of its falling
and breaking.

00:37:19.260 --> 00:37:23.090
If they each hold the same
strength, then you've

00:37:23.090 --> 00:37:26.320
distributed the load in a
much more balanced way.

00:37:26.320 --> 00:37:29.170
So this is a kind of a balance
condition, and it's very

00:37:29.170 --> 00:37:32.950
typical of minimization
problems. And fortunately,

00:37:32.950 --> 00:37:35.810
there are nice solutions which
distribute the weight

00:37:35.810 --> 00:37:37.020
reasonably well.

00:37:37.020 --> 00:37:41.290
That's certainly the principal
of suspension bridges.

00:37:41.290 --> 00:37:42.820
So yeah, one more question.

00:37:42.820 --> 00:37:44.760
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:37:44.760 --> 00:37:49.480
PROFESSOR: OK, so the question
where it hangs, that is, what

00:37:49.480 --> 00:37:53.030
the formula for x is and what
the formula for y is.

00:37:53.030 --> 00:37:56.240
And other things, like the
equation for the ellipse and

00:37:56.240 --> 00:37:58.310
lots of other stuff like that.

00:37:58.310 --> 00:38:02.030
Those are things that I will
answer for you in a set of

00:38:02.030 --> 00:38:03.700
notes which I will hand out.

00:38:03.700 --> 00:38:06.310
And they're just a mess.

00:38:06.310 --> 00:38:08.930
You see they're, just as in that
other problem that we did

00:38:08.930 --> 00:38:11.940
last time, there's some
illuminating things you can

00:38:11.940 --> 00:38:15.890
say about the problem and then
there's some messy formulas.

00:38:15.890 --> 00:38:19.270
You know, you want to try to
pick out the simple things

00:38:19.270 --> 00:38:19.930
that you can say.

00:38:19.930 --> 00:38:23.420
In fact, that's a property of
math, you want to focus on the

00:38:23.420 --> 00:38:24.500
more comprehensible things.

00:38:24.500 --> 00:38:26.770
On the other hand,
it can be done.

00:38:26.770 --> 00:38:30.290
It just takes a little
bit of computation.

00:38:30.290 --> 00:38:32.080
So I didn't answer the
question of what

00:38:32.080 --> 00:38:33.630
the lowest y was.

00:38:33.630 --> 00:38:39.020
But I'll do that for you.

00:38:39.020 --> 00:38:42.760
Maybe I'll just mention one more
thing about this problem.

00:38:42.760 --> 00:38:44.410
I'm using problems
from a completely

00:38:44.410 --> 00:38:45.890
different point of view.

00:38:45.890 --> 00:38:50.690
If you sort of roll the ellipse
around, you get the

00:38:50.690 --> 00:38:55.580
same phenomenon from
each place here.

00:38:55.580 --> 00:38:58.170
So it doesn't matter
where a and 0 are.

00:38:58.170 --> 00:38:59.490
You'll get the same
phenomenon.

00:38:59.490 --> 00:39:02.040
That is, the tangent line.

00:39:02.040 --> 00:39:06.030
So, this angle and that
angle will be equal.

00:39:06.030 --> 00:39:10.110
So you can also read that as
being the angle over here and

00:39:10.110 --> 00:39:11.350
the angle over here are equal.

00:39:11.350 --> 00:39:14.300
That is, beta, that is
the complementary

00:39:14.300 --> 00:39:17.290
angles are also equal.

00:39:17.290 --> 00:39:21.730
And if you interpret this as a
ray of light, and this as a

00:39:21.730 --> 00:39:24.670
mirror, then this would be
saying that if you start at

00:39:24.670 --> 00:39:28.290
one focus, every ray of light
will bounce and go to the

00:39:28.290 --> 00:39:29.310
other focus.

00:39:29.310 --> 00:39:32.690
So that's a property that
an ellipse has.

00:39:32.690 --> 00:39:36.460
More precisely, a property that
this kind of curve has.

00:39:36.460 --> 00:39:41.900
And in fact, a few years ago
there was this great piece of

00:39:41.900 --> 00:39:45.210
art at something called the
DeCordova Museum, which I

00:39:45.210 --> 00:39:50.570
recommended very highly to you
go sometime to visit in your

00:39:50.570 --> 00:39:52.460
four years here.

00:39:52.460 --> 00:39:59.000
There was a collection of
miniature golf holes.

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:02.650
So they had a bunch of mini
golf pieces of art.

00:40:02.650 --> 00:40:04.320
And every one was completely
different from the other.

00:40:04.320 --> 00:40:07.910
And one of them was called
hole in one.

00:40:07.910 --> 00:40:11.110
And the tee was at one
focus of the ellipse.

00:40:11.110 --> 00:40:15.390
And the hole was at the other
focus of the ellipse.

00:40:15.390 --> 00:40:19.070
So, no matter how you hit
the golf ball, it always

00:40:19.070 --> 00:40:21.790
goes into the hole.

00:40:21.790 --> 00:40:24.595
No matter where it bounces,
it just, one bounce

00:40:24.595 --> 00:40:26.820
and it's in the hole.

00:40:26.820 --> 00:40:30.550
So that's actually a consequence
of the computation

00:40:30.550 --> 00:40:40.260
that we just did.

00:40:40.260 --> 00:40:42.170
Time to go on.

00:40:42.170 --> 00:41:06.150
We're going to now talk
about something else.

00:41:06.150 --> 00:41:10.990
So our next topic is
Newton's method.

00:41:10.990 --> 00:41:24.020
Which is one of the greatest
applications of calculus.

00:41:24.020 --> 00:41:27.610
And I'm going to describe
it here for you.

00:41:27.610 --> 00:41:36.940
And we'll illustrate it on an
example, which is solving the

00:41:36.940 --> 00:41:39.970
equation x^2 = 5.

00:41:39.970 --> 00:41:42.000
We're going to find the
square root of 5.

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:45.520
Now, you can actually solve
any equation this way.

00:41:45.520 --> 00:41:47.710
Any equation that you
understand, you can solve this

00:41:47.710 --> 00:41:49.930
way, essentially.

00:41:49.930 --> 00:41:52.120
So even though I'm doing it
for the square root of 5,

00:41:52.120 --> 00:41:54.240
which is something that you
can figure out on your

00:41:54.240 --> 00:41:59.690
calculator, in fact this is
really at the heart of many of

00:41:59.690 --> 00:42:02.210
the ways in which calculators
work.

00:42:02.210 --> 00:42:04.310
So, the first thing is to
make this problem a

00:42:04.310 --> 00:42:06.420
little bit more abstract.

00:42:06.420 --> 00:42:13.830
We're going to set f
( x ) = x^2 - 5.

00:42:13.830 --> 00:42:19.840
And then we're going
to solve f (x) = 0.

00:42:19.840 --> 00:42:22.980
So this is the sort of
standard form for

00:42:22.980 --> 00:42:24.120
solving such a.

00:42:24.120 --> 00:42:27.360
So you take some either
complicated or simple function

00:42:27.360 --> 00:42:30.310
of x, linear functions are
boring, quadratic functions

00:42:30.310 --> 00:42:32.550
are already interesting.

00:42:32.550 --> 00:42:36.720
And cubic functions, as I've
said a few times, you don't

00:42:36.720 --> 00:42:37.980
even have formulas
for solving.

00:42:37.980 --> 00:42:40.295
So this would be the only method
you have for solving

00:42:40.295 --> 00:42:43.750
them numerically.

00:42:43.750 --> 00:42:45.810
So here's how it works.

00:42:45.810 --> 00:42:50.010
So the idea, I'll plot
this function.

00:42:50.010 --> 00:42:55.810
Here's the function, it's
a parabola, y = x^2 - 5.

00:42:55.810 --> 00:42:57.600
It dips below 0, sorry,
it should be

00:42:57.600 --> 00:43:01.090
centered, but anyway.

00:43:01.090 --> 00:43:06.530
And now the idea here is
to start with a guess.

00:43:06.530 --> 00:43:11.380
And square root of 5 is pretty
close to the square root of 4,

00:43:11.380 --> 00:43:12.360
which is 2.

00:43:12.360 --> 00:43:17.030
So my first guess is going
to be 2, here.

00:43:17.030 --> 00:43:30.510
So start with initial guess.

00:43:30.510 --> 00:43:32.320
So that's our first guess.

00:43:32.320 --> 00:43:37.070
And now, what we're going to do
is we're going to pretend

00:43:37.070 --> 00:43:40.080
that the function is linear.

00:43:40.080 --> 00:43:41.300
That's all we're going to do.

00:43:41.300 --> 00:43:45.710
And then if the function were
linear, we're going to try to

00:43:45.710 --> 00:43:47.550
find where the 0 is.

00:43:47.550 --> 00:43:50.470
So if the function is linear,
what we'll use is we'll plot

00:43:50.470 --> 00:43:58.340
the point where 2 is on, that
is, the point (2, f ( 2 )),

00:43:58.340 --> 00:44:06.660
and then we're going to draw
the tangent line here.

00:44:06.660 --> 00:44:15.810
And this is going to be
our new guess. x = x,

00:44:15.810 --> 00:44:22.420
which I'll call x1.

00:44:22.420 --> 00:44:26.830
So the idea here is that this
point may be somewhat far from

00:44:26.830 --> 00:44:31.250
where it crosses, but this point
will be a little closer.

00:44:31.250 --> 00:44:33.830
And now we're going to do this
over and over again.

00:44:33.830 --> 00:44:38.340
And see how fast it gets to the
place we're aiming for.

00:44:38.340 --> 00:44:42.020
So we have to work out what
the formulas are.

00:44:42.020 --> 00:44:53.700
And that's the strategy.

00:44:53.700 --> 00:45:01.730
So now, the first step here is,
we have our guess, we have

00:45:01.730 --> 00:45:06.020
our tangent line.

00:45:06.020 --> 00:45:13.540
Which has the formula
y - y0 = m(x - x0).

00:45:13.540 --> 00:45:16.220
So that's the general form
for a tangent line.

00:45:16.220 --> 00:45:20.140
And now, I have to tell
you what x1 is.

00:45:20.140 --> 00:45:29.970
In terms of this tangent line.
x1 is the x intercept.

00:45:29.970 --> 00:45:33.420
The tangent line, if you look
over here at the diagram, the

00:45:33.420 --> 00:45:36.220
tangent line is the
orange line.

00:45:36.220 --> 00:45:41.340
Where that crosses the axis,
that's where I want to put x1.

00:45:41.340 --> 00:45:43.530
So that's the x intercept.

00:45:43.530 --> 00:45:46.670
Now, how do you find
the x intercept?

00:45:46.670 --> 00:45:49.760
You find it by setting y = 0.

00:45:49.760 --> 00:45:52.270
That horizontal line is y = 0.

00:45:52.270 --> 00:45:59.790
So I set y = 0, and I get
0 - y0 = m (x1 - x0).

00:45:59.790 --> 00:46:02.300
So I changed two things
in this equation.

00:46:02.300 --> 00:46:04.970
I plugged in 0 here, for y.

00:46:04.970 --> 00:46:07.340
And I said that the place where
that happens is going to

00:46:07.340 --> 00:46:13.050
be where x is x1.

00:46:13.050 --> 00:46:15.530
So now let's solve.

00:46:15.530 --> 00:46:19.700
And what we get here is -
y divided by - sorry,

00:46:19.700 --> 00:46:26.390
-y0 / m = x1 - x0.

00:46:26.390 --> 00:46:30.800
And now I can get a
formula for x1.

00:46:30.800 --> 00:46:46.600
So x1 = x0 - (y0 / m).

00:46:46.600 --> 00:46:53.580
I now need to tell you what this
formula means, in terms

00:46:53.580 --> 00:46:56.070
of the function f.

00:46:56.070 --> 00:46:59.230
So first of all, x0 is
x0, whatever x0 is.

00:46:59.230 --> 00:47:06.230
And y0, I claim, is f (x0).

00:47:06.230 --> 00:47:11.080
And m is the slope at
that same place.

00:47:11.080 --> 00:47:17.230
So it's f' (x0).

00:47:17.230 --> 00:47:19.650
And this is the whole story.

00:47:19.650 --> 00:47:25.440
This is the formula which will
enable us to calculate

00:47:25.440 --> 00:47:34.520
basically any root.

00:47:34.520 --> 00:47:36.850
I'm going to repeat this
formula, so I'm going to tell

00:47:36.850 --> 00:47:40.620
you again what Newton's method
is, and put a little more

00:47:40.620 --> 00:47:43.080
colorful box around it.

00:47:43.080 --> 00:47:53.210
So Newton's method involves
the following formula.

00:47:53.210 --> 00:47:58.830
In order to get the n + 1st
point, that's our better and

00:47:58.830 --> 00:48:03.070
better guess, I'm going to take
the nth one and then I'm

00:48:03.070 --> 00:48:04.330
going to plug in this formula.

00:48:04.330 --> 00:48:09.870
So f ( xn ) / f' ( xn ).

00:48:09.870 --> 00:48:14.010
So this is the basic formula,
and if you like, this is the

00:48:14.010 --> 00:48:18.820
idea of just repeating
what I had before.

00:48:18.820 --> 00:48:22.230
Now, we've gone from geometry,
from just pictures, to an

00:48:22.230 --> 00:48:24.170
honest to goodness formula
which is completely

00:48:24.170 --> 00:48:29.450
implementable and very easy
to implement in any case.

00:48:29.450 --> 00:48:33.540
So let's see how it works in
the case that we've got.

00:48:33.540 --> 00:48:41.160
Which is x0 = 2.
f(x) = x^2 - 5.

00:48:41.160 --> 00:48:44.850
Let's see how to implement
this formula.

00:48:44.850 --> 00:48:49.920
So first of all, I have to
calculate for you, f' (x).

00:48:49.920 --> 00:48:55.200
That's 2x.

00:48:55.200 --> 00:49:05.730
And so, x1 = x0 -, so
f' , sorry, f ( x )

00:49:05.730 --> 00:49:08.690
would be x0^2 - 5.

00:49:08.690 --> 00:49:10.550
That's what's in
the numerator.

00:49:10.550 --> 00:49:11.760
And in the denominator
I have the

00:49:11.760 --> 00:49:18.820
derivative, so that's 2 x0.

00:49:18.820 --> 00:49:23.920
And so all told, well, let's
work it out in two steps here.

00:49:23.920 --> 00:49:30.800
This is - 1/2 x0 for the first
term, and then + (5/2 / x0)

00:49:30.800 --> 00:49:31.750
for the second term.

00:49:31.750 --> 00:49:40.450
And these two terms combine, so
we have here 1/2 x0 + 5/2

00:49:40.450 --> 00:49:43.010
with an x0 in the denominator.

00:49:43.010 --> 00:49:53.310
So here's the formula for
x1. in this case.

00:49:53.310 --> 00:50:03.620
Now I'd like to show you
how well this works.

00:50:03.620 --> 00:50:11.150
So first of all, we have x1 =
1/2 ( 2), if I plug in x1, +

00:50:11.150 --> 00:50:16.630
5/4, which is 9/4.

00:50:16.630 --> 00:50:28.550
And x2, I have 1/2 (
9/4) + 5/2 ( 4/9).

00:50:28.550 --> 00:50:30.360
That's the next one.

00:50:30.360 --> 00:50:37.610
And if you work this
out, it's 161/72.

00:50:37.610 --> 00:50:41.340
And then x3 is kind of long.

00:50:41.340 --> 00:50:43.510
But I will just write down what
it is, so that you can

00:50:43.510 --> 00:50:49.580
see it's 1/2 ( 161/72) +
5/2 and then I do the

00:50:49.580 --> 00:50:50.600
reciprocal of that.

00:50:50.600 --> 00:50:56.620
So 72/161.

00:50:56.620 --> 00:51:00.770
So let's see how
good these are.

00:51:00.770 --> 00:51:05.850
I carefully calculated
how far off they are.

00:51:05.850 --> 00:51:07.510
Somewhere on my notes.

00:51:07.510 --> 00:51:11.660
So I'll just take a look
and see what I said.

00:51:11.660 --> 00:51:13.930
Oh yeah, I did do it.

00:51:13.930 --> 00:51:20.870
So, what's the square root of 5
minus - so here's n, here's

00:51:20.870 --> 00:51:24.420
the square root of 5
- xn, if you like.

00:51:24.420 --> 00:51:26.800
Or the other way around.

00:51:26.800 --> 00:51:28.900
The size of this.

00:51:28.900 --> 00:51:32.300
You'll have to decide on your
homework whether it comes out

00:51:32.300 --> 00:51:34.200
positive or negative,
to the right or to

00:51:34.200 --> 00:51:35.660
the left of the answer.

00:51:35.660 --> 00:51:37.460
But let's do this.

00:51:37.460 --> 00:51:41.070
So when n = 0, the
guess was 2.

00:51:41.070 --> 00:51:45.330
And we're off by about
2 ( 10 ^ - 1).

00:51:45.330 --> 00:51:50.090
And if n = 1, so that's this
9/4, that's off by

00:51:50.090 --> 00:51:53.120
about 10 ^ - 2.

00:51:53.120 --> 00:51:58.240
And then n = 2, that's this
number here, right?

00:51:58.240 --> 00:52:03.540
And that's off by about
4 ( 10 ^ - 5).

00:52:03.540 --> 00:52:06.270
That's already as good an
approximation to the square

00:52:06.270 --> 00:52:10.450
root of 5 as you'll ever
need in your life.

00:52:10.450 --> 00:52:18.190
If you do 3, this number here
turns out to be accurate to 10

00:52:18.190 --> 00:52:20.140
^ - 10 or so.

00:52:20.140 --> 00:52:22.190
This goes right off
to the edge of my

00:52:22.190 --> 00:52:23.890
calculator, this one here.

00:52:23.890 --> 00:52:29.270
So already, with the third
iterate. you're of way past

00:52:29.270 --> 00:52:31.340
the accuracy that you need
for most things.

00:52:31.340 --> 00:52:32.070
Yep, question.

00:52:32.070 --> 00:52:32.200
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:52:32.200 --> 00:52:38.660
PROFESSOR: How come
the x0 disappears?

00:52:38.660 --> 00:52:39.820
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:52:39.820 --> 00:52:56.010
PROFESSOR: So, from here
to here [INAUDIBLE]

00:52:56.010 --> 00:52:56.380
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:52:56.380 --> 00:52:58.280
PROFESSOR: Hang on, folks,
we have a question.

00:52:58.280 --> 00:52:59.390
Let's just answer it.

00:52:59.390 --> 00:53:03.220
So here we have an x0, and here
we have - 1/2, there's an

00:53:03.220 --> 00:53:08.050
x0^2 and an x which cancel.

00:53:08.050 --> 00:53:11.480
And here we have a minus,
and a - 5/2 x0.

00:53:11.480 --> 00:53:16.150
So I combine the 1 - 1/2,
I got + 1/2, that's all.

00:53:16.150 --> 00:53:17.680
OK?

00:53:17.680 --> 00:53:18.890
Alright, thanks.

00:53:18.890 --> 00:53:21.910
We'll have to ask other
questions after class.
