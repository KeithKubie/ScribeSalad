TIMOTHY JORDAN: Hello,
I'm Timothy Jordan,

00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:04.070
and this week I'm coming to
you from the Firebase Dev

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:05.705
Summit in Amsterdam.

00:00:05.705 --> 00:00:07.830
Here's your update about
the coolest developer news

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.210
from Google in the last week.

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:12.180

Android Go and a new Neural

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:23.370
Networks API to accelerate
on-device machine intelligence.

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:26.010
We've also included a few
smaller enhancements to Oreo

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.920

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.830

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.910

Go 1.8 introduces library,
runtime, performance,

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:54.330

the Google App Engine

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:58.770

we previewed earlier
this year, is now

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:04.860
available to all
developers, and it

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.200
lets you integrate
your app into Gmail

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.230
and extend Gmail to
handle quick actions.
