00:00:00.357 --> 00:00:02.563
- There were a lot of foods
that I was really excited

00:00:02.563 --> 00:00:05.926
to eat when I came to
Istanbul, but this one dish

00:00:05.926 --> 00:00:08.603
which is called kokorec
is one of the things

00:00:08.603 --> 00:00:12.770
I cannot wait to try and
I'm gonna try it right now.

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:18.463
(upbeat music)

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:22.387
Good morning, everyone, it's Mark Wiens

00:00:22.387 --> 00:00:26.013
with migrationology.com
in Istanbul, Turkey.

00:00:26.013 --> 00:00:27.726
Walking through Taksim Square now

00:00:27.726 --> 00:00:29.797
and we are on our way to go eat breakfast.

00:00:29.797 --> 00:00:32.297
(chill music)

00:00:33.197 --> 00:00:36.921
Walking through Istikal
Street at 7:45 in the morning,

00:00:36.921 --> 00:00:38.342
it is nice and quiet.

00:00:38.342 --> 00:00:40.842
(chill music)

00:00:42.072 --> 00:00:44.058
We came to this restaurant
which is just off

00:00:44.058 --> 00:00:47.436
Istikal Street and they
are famous especially

00:00:47.436 --> 00:00:51.611
for serving menemen which
is a type of egg dish.

00:00:51.611 --> 00:00:54.528
It's chicken with eggs.
- Thank you.

00:00:56.944 --> 00:00:57.944
- Thank you.

00:00:59.961 --> 00:01:02.984
I ordered a dish called
menemen which is Turkish

00:01:02.984 --> 00:01:05.542
scrambled eggs and I got the one

00:01:05.542 --> 00:01:07.959
with Turkish sausage as well.

00:01:08.796 --> 00:01:11.853
It looks beautiful, it came
to our table sizzling hot,

00:01:11.853 --> 00:01:13.222
just boiling over.

00:01:13.222 --> 00:01:16.441
There are peppers and tomatoes
and the sausage in here.

00:01:16.441 --> 00:01:18.814
Before I dig in the
bread, I just gotta go in

00:01:18.814 --> 00:01:19.647
with my fork.

00:01:19.647 --> 00:01:21.819
Wow, look at that texture.

00:01:21.819 --> 00:01:25.466
It's almost like gravy in texture.

00:01:25.466 --> 00:01:29.054
That really smells like chorizo and eggs.

00:01:29.054 --> 00:01:31.178
Oh that Turkish sausage.

00:01:31.178 --> 00:01:32.678
I have a feeling this
is just gonna be like

00:01:32.678 --> 00:01:36.072
a sponge of fire so I'm
gonna let it cool down

00:01:36.072 --> 00:01:37.489
for a little bit.

00:01:43.813 --> 00:01:44.980
Mm-hm, oh wow.

00:01:48.614 --> 00:01:50.618
That's awesome.

00:01:50.618 --> 00:01:54.444
Yeah, it's like, it's only half
cooked, just lightly cooked

00:01:54.444 --> 00:01:58.194
so it remains really,
really moist and juicy.

00:01:59.125 --> 00:02:03.064
And then that Turkish
sausage is brilliant.

00:02:03.064 --> 00:02:06.517
A little bit spicy and then the texture

00:02:06.517 --> 00:02:08.209
of that egg is unbelievable.

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:11.876
Let me follow that with
a little bit of tea.

00:02:14.293 --> 00:02:16.382
Hot tea and then let me try my next bite

00:02:16.382 --> 00:02:17.882
with some bread.

00:02:17.882 --> 00:02:20.536
Whoa, that's some pretty solid bread.

00:02:20.536 --> 00:02:25.370
And then you take pieces
of bread, break off a piece

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:29.537
and I'm gonna go with kind
of a scoop and mop method.

00:02:32.546 --> 00:02:37.187
Oh yeah, you need to get a
close up of this texture.

00:02:37.187 --> 00:02:39.563
Just come to look at that,
it's almost like cottage

00:02:39.563 --> 00:02:41.063
cheese in texture.

00:02:50.862 --> 00:02:55.029
That is awesome and I don't
think there's any cheese.

00:02:56.125 --> 00:02:57.444
At first I thought there was cheese

00:02:57.444 --> 00:02:59.555
but I don't think
there's any cheese in it.

00:02:59.555 --> 00:03:03.747
Got a little salad here
with tomatoes and chilies

00:03:03.747 --> 00:03:05.997
and maybe that's olive oil.

00:03:08.056 --> 00:03:08.889
Oh.

00:03:13.255 --> 00:03:16.036
Yeah, this is very light.

00:03:16.036 --> 00:03:20.808
I think olive oil and maybe
just a little squeeze of lemon.

00:03:20.808 --> 00:03:24.064
And then this one is another
very common Turkish breakfast

00:03:24.064 --> 00:03:25.314
kind of spread.

00:03:26.213 --> 00:03:28.610
I think it is the
clotted cream with honey.

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:30.414
You take a little bit of this.

00:03:30.414 --> 00:03:34.497
I think with some honey,
clotted cream and honey.

00:03:38.512 --> 00:03:39.345
Wow.

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:44.473
That's like rich and
creamy and honey sweet.

00:03:44.473 --> 00:03:48.640
I think that is cream but it
has a butter texture to it.

00:03:49.919 --> 00:03:53.005
I also got some olives and
I think this is cheese.

00:03:53.005 --> 00:03:54.838
Let me taste an olive.

00:03:57.613 --> 00:03:58.446
Oh yeah.

00:04:01.029 --> 00:04:03.454
It's like a little bit
of a withered olive,

00:04:03.454 --> 00:04:06.066
it's almost like a raisin olive.

00:04:06.066 --> 00:04:07.389
I think I'll go in with an olive as well

00:04:07.389 --> 00:04:08.722
all in one bite.

00:04:12.443 --> 00:04:13.860
Take out the pit.

00:04:15.233 --> 00:04:18.686
It's quite a salty cheese
and then it's very soft

00:04:18.686 --> 00:04:22.467
and spreadable and then that
combination with the olive

00:04:22.467 --> 00:04:24.717
makes it taste really good.

00:04:32.779 --> 00:04:33.612
Mmm.

00:04:35.786 --> 00:04:38.702
This is like a completely new style of egg

00:04:38.702 --> 00:04:40.091
that I've ever had.

00:04:40.091 --> 00:04:42.160
That was an amazing way to start the day.

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:44.663
That Turkish sausage
just flavored the entire

00:04:44.663 --> 00:04:46.585
scrambled eggs and I love that texture

00:04:46.585 --> 00:04:48.151
of the scrambled eggs.

00:04:48.151 --> 00:04:50.253
When we came in here it
was a little bit quiet,

00:04:50.253 --> 00:04:51.586
now it's packed.

00:04:56.071 --> 00:04:59.061
It is still a nice quiet
morning in Istanbul.

00:04:59.061 --> 00:05:02.321
We are walking down the
hill towards Galata Kulesi

00:05:02.321 --> 00:05:04.507
which is the Galata Tower.

00:05:04.507 --> 00:05:07.007
(chill music)

00:05:18.133 --> 00:05:21.017
It cost 25 lira for entrance to the top

00:05:21.017 --> 00:05:22.741
and we are getting into the elevator now

00:05:22.741 --> 00:05:24.898
to go to the top for the view.

00:05:24.898 --> 00:05:27.398
(chill music)

00:05:39.553 --> 00:05:44.534
It was built in 1348 in a
medieval Roman-esque style

00:05:44.534 --> 00:05:46.467
and at the time that it was built,

00:05:46.467 --> 00:05:49.832
it was the tallest building in Istanbul.

00:05:49.832 --> 00:05:52.695
What you do is you just take
an elevator to the top here

00:05:52.695 --> 00:05:56.347
and then walk to the top and
you can get a full 360 view

00:05:56.347 --> 00:05:57.553
of the city.

00:05:57.553 --> 00:05:59.225
What's really great about this place

00:05:59.225 --> 00:06:02.050
is just it gives you a sense
of the magnitude of Istanbul.

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:05.275
You can hear the birds,
you can really sense

00:06:05.275 --> 00:06:08.927
the contrast of the
ancient city to the modern.

00:06:08.927 --> 00:06:11.989
You have amazing views of
the Bosphorus sparkling

00:06:11.989 --> 00:06:14.434
in the sunshine, the boats.

00:06:14.434 --> 00:06:16.881
Over in the distance, across this way,

00:06:16.881 --> 00:06:20.631
you can see the Ayasofya
and the Blue Mosque.

00:06:21.513 --> 00:06:23.817
Just some incredible views from here

00:06:23.817 --> 00:06:25.865
and what I like about it
is you have a 360 view,

00:06:25.865 --> 00:06:27.793
you can walk all the way around.

00:06:27.793 --> 00:06:30.293
(chill music)

00:06:44.261 --> 00:06:46.330
I'm glad we went to the
tower right as they opened

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:48.310
because it was really quiet.

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:50.938
I can imagine that if it's really busy,

00:06:50.938 --> 00:06:55.797
it will take away from the
ambiance and the amazing views.

00:06:55.797 --> 00:06:57.652
You'll probably be rushed up there.

00:06:57.652 --> 00:07:01.016
By going right as they open,
that was a fantastic idea.

00:07:01.016 --> 00:07:02.925
I enjoyed those views.

00:07:02.925 --> 00:07:05.394
They also have a restaurant at the top

00:07:05.394 --> 00:07:07.301
but it's pretty overpriced.

00:07:07.301 --> 00:07:11.218
So we are now heading
down to the water's edge.

00:07:17.092 --> 00:07:20.368
We had some great views of
the bridge from the tower

00:07:20.368 --> 00:07:23.429
and now we are walking
across the Galata Bridge.

00:07:23.429 --> 00:07:26.883
This is an inlet of
water from the Bosphorus.

00:07:26.883 --> 00:07:30.284
The Bosphorus is over that
side, but this is called

00:07:30.284 --> 00:07:32.786
the Halic which in English
is sometimes referred

00:07:32.786 --> 00:07:36.245
to as the Golden Horn because
of the way it's shaped.

00:07:36.245 --> 00:07:39.500
It's another major waterway in Istanbul.

00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:42.325
It connects the old part
of Istanbul with the part

00:07:42.325 --> 00:07:44.141
of Istanbul that we're staying in.

00:07:44.141 --> 00:07:47.478
We are walking across it by foot.

00:07:47.478 --> 00:07:50.158
The water is such a deep blue color.

00:07:50.158 --> 00:07:54.243
Along this bridge, it's especially
a favorite fishing spot.

00:07:54.243 --> 00:07:56.743
(chill music)

00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:02.216
Walking across this bridge,
you can smell the aroma

00:08:02.216 --> 00:08:05.565
of the sea breeze, you can
smell a little bit of fish

00:08:05.565 --> 00:08:06.970
in the air.

00:08:06.970 --> 00:08:09.544
It makes me just wanna hang
out and go fishing all day long

00:08:09.544 --> 00:08:11.432
and then eat the fish.

00:08:11.432 --> 00:08:13.344
Then over there on the
top of the hill there,

00:08:13.344 --> 00:08:17.011
that is the Galata Tower
where we just were.

00:08:44.539 --> 00:08:46.206
Sit right there, no?

00:08:53.812 --> 00:08:57.267
Finished walking across the
bridge and there is a treat

00:08:57.267 --> 00:08:58.792
at the end.

00:08:58.792 --> 00:09:02.073
There are some well known boats
that serve a fish sandwich

00:09:02.073 --> 00:09:04.053
which is called balik ekmek.

00:09:04.053 --> 00:09:06.845
I think it is mackerel which is grilled

00:09:06.845 --> 00:09:08.949
and they grill it on the boat.

00:09:08.949 --> 00:09:12.616
But then they have little
seating areas on the solid ground

00:09:12.616 --> 00:09:14.565
so you're not rocking while you're eating,

00:09:14.565 --> 00:09:17.052
but I just ordered one sandwich
and as soon as you order,

00:09:17.052 --> 00:09:19.894
they grab a piece of the
pre-cooked fish filet

00:09:19.894 --> 00:09:22.344
and they stick it into a big bread loaf

00:09:22.344 --> 00:09:24.356
and then add in some lettuce and onions

00:09:24.356 --> 00:09:26.430
and along with the fish
sandwich, what's really great

00:09:26.430 --> 00:09:28.102
about this place is the ambiance.

00:09:28.102 --> 00:09:30.264
You have a great view on both sides.

00:09:30.264 --> 00:09:33.990
You're sitting on the water's
edge and this is an amazing

00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:35.407
part of Istanbul.

00:09:39.946 --> 00:09:40.779
Oh yeah.

00:09:42.982 --> 00:09:45.284
I see the attraction in that.

00:09:45.284 --> 00:09:47.157
That's really good fish.

00:09:47.157 --> 00:09:50.397
It's buttery, a little
bit oily and mackerel

00:09:50.397 --> 00:09:51.622
is one of my favorite fish.

00:09:51.622 --> 00:09:52.738
Yeah, I'm pretty sure that's mackerel.

00:09:52.738 --> 00:09:56.655
Got some lemon juice,
some bottled lemon juice.

00:09:57.889 --> 00:10:02.419
Sprinkle some of this on,
a good dose of lemon juice

00:10:02.419 --> 00:10:06.586
and I think I'll sprinkle
on a little bit of salt.

00:10:09.639 --> 00:10:12.806
That is not open, or maybe it's stuck.

00:10:22.204 --> 00:10:25.037
Okay, I think that should be good.

00:10:29.262 --> 00:10:33.429
It's a very simple sandwich
but I do love the fish.

00:10:35.824 --> 00:10:37.034
The grilled fish was good.

00:10:37.034 --> 00:10:39.197
Grilled fish is one of my favorite things.

00:10:39.197 --> 00:10:41.177
I think it would've been
improved had they given me

00:10:41.177 --> 00:10:44.056
a fresh wedge of lemon
as opposed to the lemon

00:10:44.056 --> 00:10:47.478
in the bottle, but it was still good.

00:10:47.478 --> 00:10:49.186
I love this ambiance.

00:10:49.186 --> 00:10:52.640
There are a number of boats
along this stretch here.

00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:55.179
I think they pretty much
all serve the same things,

00:10:55.179 --> 00:10:56.852
so we just chose one.

00:10:56.852 --> 00:10:59.062
We crossed over the road
and we are now entering

00:10:59.062 --> 00:11:01.678
into the Egyptian bazaar
which is also known

00:11:01.678 --> 00:11:03.385
as the spice market.

00:11:03.385 --> 00:11:05.922
There are lots and lots of spices and nuts

00:11:05.922 --> 00:11:09.288
and dried fruit and all
sorts of cheeses and olives

00:11:09.288 --> 00:11:10.884
and candies.

00:11:10.884 --> 00:11:13.217
Look at this amount of nuts.

00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:16.703
(exotic music)

00:11:19.415 --> 00:11:21.332
A microphone for audio.

00:11:24.631 --> 00:11:25.464
Thank you.

00:11:28.882 --> 00:11:30.214
Hello, sir.
- Hello.

00:11:30.214 --> 00:11:32.118
- [Mark] Can I have one
kilo of cherries please?

00:11:32.118 --> 00:11:33.725
- Cherries, 12.

00:11:33.725 --> 00:11:35.199
- [Mark] 12, okay, one kilo please.

00:11:35.199 --> 00:11:36.699
- Thank you.
- Yes.

00:11:39.174 --> 00:11:41.174
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

00:11:44.435 --> 00:11:48.352
I guess or maybe you
should not, I will though.

00:11:52.643 --> 00:11:54.060
Apricot, apricot.

00:11:54.926 --> 00:11:57.176
I think this is an apricot.

00:12:00.851 --> 00:12:01.684
Mmm.

00:12:03.332 --> 00:12:06.755
Oh that's wonderful, sweet and juicy.

00:12:06.755 --> 00:12:08.520
Ying really loves cherries
so we stopped to buy

00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:11.545
a kilo of cherries and
now we are sampling fruit

00:12:11.545 --> 00:12:12.712
at this store.

00:12:13.736 --> 00:12:16.404
(speaks foreign language)

00:12:16.404 --> 00:12:17.237
Mmm.

00:12:19.861 --> 00:12:24.340
We do not get cherries in
Thailand, that is a treat.

00:12:24.340 --> 00:12:26.738
It's juicy and just perfectly sweet.

00:12:26.738 --> 00:12:29.974
Not too sweet but that's wonderful.

00:12:29.974 --> 00:12:30.913
Nice to meet you.

00:12:30.913 --> 00:12:33.288
- Hello, hello, welcome.

00:12:33.288 --> 00:12:34.601
- We were just walking around the outside

00:12:34.601 --> 00:12:36.816
of the market now and
I've just come inside

00:12:36.816 --> 00:12:41.461
and again there is just a
bounty of colorful things.

00:12:41.461 --> 00:12:43.314
This is my kind of a market.

00:12:43.314 --> 00:12:45.296
So many spices and aromas.

00:12:45.296 --> 00:12:47.312
You can smell coffee, you can smell cumin,

00:12:47.312 --> 00:12:50.872
you can smell turmeric, the chilies.

00:12:50.872 --> 00:12:54.095
Maybe some incense in
the air and some perfume

00:12:54.095 --> 00:12:56.095
and the Turkish delight.

00:12:57.783 --> 00:13:01.866
There's so many colors
and aromas in this market.

00:13:02.788 --> 00:13:05.371
Nice to meet you.
- You too man.

00:13:07.837 --> 00:13:09.587
- Yes, still filming.

00:13:11.042 --> 00:13:14.566
We are just walking out
of the Egyptian Bazaar now

00:13:14.566 --> 00:13:16.802
but what I loved is that
not only did they have

00:13:16.802 --> 00:13:18.798
so many different spices
but there are so many

00:13:18.798 --> 00:13:22.974
different herbs and flowers,
the different zaatars,

00:13:22.974 --> 00:13:26.661
the saffron, the roselle and many things

00:13:26.661 --> 00:13:28.967
I don't know the name of but
there's such an abundance

00:13:28.967 --> 00:13:30.825
of different flavorful ingredients.

00:13:30.825 --> 00:13:33.416
Oh and the sumac, lots of
different kinds of sumac

00:13:33.416 --> 00:13:35.645
and dried chilies as well.

00:13:35.645 --> 00:13:38.228
(upbeat music)

00:13:39.968 --> 00:13:42.381
From the Egyptian Bazaar,
we are walking up the hill

00:13:42.381 --> 00:13:44.920
towards the Suleymaniye Camii.

00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:47.599
Istanbul is a very hilly
city and that means

00:13:47.599 --> 00:13:49.937
you exercise when you eat.

00:13:49.937 --> 00:13:51.807
I needed that little exercise.

00:13:51.807 --> 00:13:54.796
This is another one of
the dominant mosques

00:13:54.796 --> 00:13:58.046
that you can see on Istanbul's skyline.

00:14:02.897 --> 00:14:05.595
The entrance courtyard
area has a very similar

00:14:05.595 --> 00:14:10.399
feel to it as the Sultan
Ahmed Camii, the Blue Mosque.

00:14:10.399 --> 00:14:13.482
Again this is a huge open court yard.

00:14:27.894 --> 00:14:30.083
What really stands out
to me are the chandeliers

00:14:30.083 --> 00:14:33.332
are so interesting especially
the one in the center.

00:14:33.332 --> 00:14:37.073
It is a giant circle which
hangs from the ceiling

00:14:37.073 --> 00:14:40.224
from the ceiling dome and
just these little light bulbs

00:14:40.224 --> 00:14:41.571
hanging off of it.

00:14:41.571 --> 00:14:45.176
It just looks like ancient and medieval.

00:14:45.176 --> 00:14:47.676
(chill music)

00:14:56.885 --> 00:14:59.226
And also there's a nice
view of the Bosphorus

00:14:59.226 --> 00:15:00.753
and the Golden Horn from here.

00:15:00.753 --> 00:15:03.709
I can see over in the
distance the Galata Tower

00:15:03.709 --> 00:15:05.664
where we visited this
morning as well as the bridge

00:15:05.664 --> 00:15:09.321
that we crossed and also where
we ate the fish sandwich.

00:15:09.321 --> 00:15:11.139
That was well worth
the visit at the mosque

00:15:11.139 --> 00:15:12.665
and now we are walking back down the hill

00:15:12.665 --> 00:15:14.681
on our way to go eat again.

00:15:14.681 --> 00:15:17.181
(chill music)

00:15:25.163 --> 00:15:26.371
- Hello.
- Hello.

00:15:26.371 --> 00:15:28.760
(speaks foreign language)

00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:30.093
- Oh, thank you.

00:15:32.544 --> 00:15:33.927
Oh wow.

00:15:33.927 --> 00:15:35.961
There were a lot of foods
that I was really excited

00:15:35.961 --> 00:15:39.273
to eat when I came to
Istanbul but this one dish

00:15:39.273 --> 00:15:41.290
which is called kokorec.

00:15:41.290 --> 00:15:44.726
Which is a combination of, I
think it's mostly intestines

00:15:44.726 --> 00:15:46.906
but maybe some other organs as well

00:15:46.906 --> 00:15:50.506
which are grilled over
fire in a circular shape

00:15:50.506 --> 00:15:54.252
is one of the things I cannot wait to try

00:15:54.252 --> 00:15:56.122
and I'm gonna try it right now.

00:15:56.122 --> 00:15:57.676
It's kind of a street food
stall because everything

00:15:57.676 --> 00:16:00.656
is open air and all of the
tables are out on the sidewalks

00:16:00.656 --> 00:16:03.106
in kind of this little
neighborhood square.

00:16:03.106 --> 00:16:06.183
It's a busy place but at the same time

00:16:06.183 --> 00:16:08.521
it's kind of quiet and
peaceful and you can hide away

00:16:08.521 --> 00:16:11.972
underneath the foyer here to eat.

00:16:11.972 --> 00:16:13.435
A lot of people will order the sandwich

00:16:13.435 --> 00:16:15.791
where he chops up some
of the meat and some

00:16:15.791 --> 00:16:17.845
of the intestines and
sticks it into a loaf

00:16:17.845 --> 00:16:19.448
and eat it like a sandwich.

00:16:19.448 --> 00:16:21.120
But I had to go for the plate.

00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:24.720
He very delicately and
expertly sliced it into pieces

00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:26.919
and just arranged it onto this plate.

00:16:26.919 --> 00:16:29.563
Then he sprinkled on some zaatar I think

00:16:29.563 --> 00:16:32.581
and then also some chili
and actually while I was

00:16:32.581 --> 00:16:35.587
taking a video of him
preparing this plate,

00:16:35.587 --> 00:16:37.761
he gave me sample so
I've already tasted it

00:16:37.761 --> 00:16:39.114
and it is amazing.

00:16:39.114 --> 00:16:42.802
You can see that is a
pure beautiful golden,

00:16:42.802 --> 00:16:44.709
almost red color on the outside.

00:16:44.709 --> 00:16:47.675
Then on the inside, it
just looks like wonderful,

00:16:47.675 --> 00:16:49.508
white gooey oily meat.

00:16:50.974 --> 00:16:52.990
- [Ying] One, two, three.

00:16:52.990 --> 00:16:55.397
- On video, Ying, what is your name?

00:16:55.397 --> 00:16:58.240
- Hassan.
- Hassan, OK, Mark.

00:16:58.240 --> 00:16:59.735
- Mark.
- Mark.

00:16:59.735 --> 00:17:01.553
The owner chef, he has just come over

00:17:01.553 --> 00:17:05.100
and he told me to eat it right
now while it's hot and fresh.

00:17:05.100 --> 00:17:06.986
So I better start eating before I,

00:17:06.986 --> 00:17:10.653
I better stop explaining
it and just eat it.

00:17:16.186 --> 00:17:17.936
Oh, that is stunning.

00:17:20.033 --> 00:17:23.397
It has a wonderful kind
of bitter taste to it.

00:17:23.397 --> 00:17:27.564
Then it's like really crispy
on the outside golden edge.

00:17:29.102 --> 00:17:33.480
But then really soft and you
can like feel the texture

00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:35.638
of the intestines on the inside layer.

00:17:35.638 --> 00:17:37.002
What's also really good is the combination

00:17:37.002 --> 00:17:38.841
of that really crispy, crunchy edge

00:17:38.841 --> 00:17:40.027
on the top.

00:17:40.027 --> 00:17:43.329
Then with the really
soft, oily, kind of fatty

00:17:43.329 --> 00:17:44.579
down interiors.

00:17:46.406 --> 00:17:47.573
Add one piece.

00:17:50.042 --> 00:17:50.875
And there.

00:17:51.709 --> 00:17:54.376
Maybe I'll try this pickle next.

00:17:55.225 --> 00:17:57.725
Ah, I think these are chilies.

00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:02.997
I think I'll add that
there and then go for it.

00:18:10.653 --> 00:18:12.153
Okay, I love that.

00:18:13.443 --> 00:18:14.341
That is amazing.

00:18:14.341 --> 00:18:18.176
That bitter taste, that
chili, the herb taste

00:18:18.176 --> 00:18:22.343
of that zaatar, the crispy to
like creamy, fatty intestines.

00:18:24.801 --> 00:18:27.190
You've got a nice lamb flavor as well.

00:18:27.190 --> 00:18:30.023
That is like a mild pickled chili.

00:18:33.207 --> 00:18:35.974
Have some more of these
pickled chilies to my plate,

00:18:35.974 --> 00:18:38.100
these are really good and
they complement the dish

00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:42.267
really well because of the
refreshing pickled brine

00:18:43.822 --> 00:18:47.989
with the pretty, fatty
intestines but they're so good.

00:18:49.151 --> 00:18:50.682
Break a piece of that bread.

00:18:50.682 --> 00:18:52.176
This is a nice bread as well.

00:18:52.176 --> 00:18:55.055
It almost has that
swiss cheese look to it.

00:18:55.055 --> 00:18:59.062
All those crunchy bits are just insane.

00:18:59.062 --> 00:19:00.145
Grab a chili.

00:19:02.374 --> 00:19:03.874
One's sliding out.

00:19:12.766 --> 00:19:16.849
That's like just oily,
buttery, bitter intestines

00:19:18.058 --> 00:19:19.625
and it's wonderful.

00:19:19.625 --> 00:19:23.125
(speaks foreign language)

00:19:25.329 --> 00:19:28.230
That kokorec was fantastic, I loved it

00:19:28.230 --> 00:19:31.396
and also right here they
have a little stall set up

00:19:31.396 --> 00:19:34.275
where they are serving
something called midye dolma

00:19:34.275 --> 00:19:37.401
which are mussels which are
filled with a combination

00:19:37.401 --> 00:19:40.306
of spices and rice and
filled back into the shell

00:19:40.306 --> 00:19:41.579
and then served like that.

00:19:41.579 --> 00:19:44.517
It's a very common street
food here in Istanbul.

00:19:44.517 --> 00:19:46.497
But as I've been walking
around, I haven't really noticed

00:19:46.497 --> 00:19:49.177
many street food stalls selling it.

00:19:49.177 --> 00:19:52.547
So maybe it's not season, so
I thought since they serve it

00:19:52.547 --> 00:19:54.652
right here, this is my opportunity.

00:19:54.652 --> 00:19:56.199
I'd better taste it right now.

00:19:56.199 --> 00:19:58.628
That's a pretty good sized mussel there.

00:19:58.628 --> 00:19:59.711
Pull it open.

00:20:02.139 --> 00:20:04.589
Oh there comes from that side.

00:20:04.589 --> 00:20:05.422
Oh, wait.

00:20:07.355 --> 00:20:09.605
When you open up this side.

00:20:10.493 --> 00:20:13.910
Oh and I think the mussel
is maybe underneath here.

00:20:13.910 --> 00:20:17.431
Then you give it a squeeze of lemon.

00:20:17.431 --> 00:20:21.950
I think the way you eat
this is you take off,

00:20:21.950 --> 00:20:24.331
a little piece of the mussel
came off on this side.

00:20:24.331 --> 00:20:27.331
You take the other side of the shell

00:20:28.485 --> 00:20:30.902
and you kind of loosen it up.

00:20:33.835 --> 00:20:35.627
Then kind of scoop the
whole thing into your mouth

00:20:35.627 --> 00:20:36.627
in one bite.

00:20:42.819 --> 00:20:43.652
Mmm.

00:20:47.027 --> 00:20:48.944
Oh wow, that's awesome.

00:20:50.105 --> 00:20:52.183
The rice is really gooey.

00:20:52.183 --> 00:20:56.566
It has an amazing, I think
it's cinnamon in there.

00:20:56.566 --> 00:20:58.750
Kind of a sweet spice flavor.

00:20:58.750 --> 00:21:03.504
That contrasts the sourness of
the lemon, that's delicious,

00:21:03.504 --> 00:21:04.837
I need one more.

00:21:06.059 --> 00:21:09.976
There we go, I got the
mussel on the top there.

00:21:12.522 --> 00:21:14.355
Squeeze on some lemon.

00:21:22.908 --> 00:21:26.487
That rice is like the texture of pudding

00:21:26.487 --> 00:21:31.037
and just that mild blend
of spices, that lemon,

00:21:31.037 --> 00:21:33.942
and it just sort of melts into the mussel.

00:21:33.942 --> 00:21:35.416
That is marvelous.

00:21:35.416 --> 00:21:36.249
Thank you.

00:21:38.359 --> 00:21:41.812
There's no better way to end
a meal of roasted baby lamb

00:21:41.812 --> 00:21:44.645
intestines than with a cup of tea.

00:21:49.179 --> 00:21:51.173
Yeah, this is fantastic.

00:21:51.173 --> 00:21:55.025
That was a great meal and
also not only the kokorec

00:21:55.025 --> 00:21:58.227
was delicious but also those midye dolma.

00:21:58.227 --> 00:22:00.014
Those were excellent.

00:22:00.014 --> 00:22:01.848
- Together photo.
- Okay.

00:22:01.848 --> 00:22:03.525
- Together, together, you two together.

00:22:03.525 --> 00:22:05.448
- Very nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet.

00:22:05.448 --> 00:22:07.788
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet.

00:22:07.788 --> 00:22:09.481
Yes, Migrationology.

00:22:09.481 --> 00:22:11.981
All food, YouTube, on YouTube.

00:22:13.802 --> 00:22:14.951
Thank you very much.

00:22:14.951 --> 00:22:17.490
- Thank you.
- Thank you, very nice.

00:22:17.490 --> 00:22:20.891
Again not only was the food spectacular

00:22:20.891 --> 00:22:24.224
but the staff and the owner,
they were so nice and friendly.

00:22:24.224 --> 00:22:27.678
Highly recommend for kokorec in Istanbul.

00:22:27.678 --> 00:22:29.872
You've gotta come check this place out.

00:22:29.872 --> 00:22:34.039
They will hook you up with
some incredible kokorec.

00:22:36.445 --> 00:22:40.112
We are now walking
towards the Grand Bazaar.

00:22:50.953 --> 00:22:53.954
We made it to the Grand Bazaar
and not only is this one

00:22:53.954 --> 00:22:56.259
of Istanbul's oldest covered markets,

00:22:56.259 --> 00:22:58.189
but it's one of the oldest covered markets

00:22:58.189 --> 00:22:59.594
in the entire world.

00:22:59.594 --> 00:23:01.261
Dating back to 1455.

00:23:10.446 --> 00:23:12.158
I've only been walking
around the market now

00:23:12.158 --> 00:23:15.179
for about 10 minutes
but literally everything

00:23:15.179 --> 00:23:18.115
that I have seen on the
streets around Istanbul so far

00:23:18.115 --> 00:23:20.706
are available at the Grand Bazaar.

00:23:20.706 --> 00:23:25.461
From carpets to clothes
to silverware to utensils

00:23:25.461 --> 00:23:29.165
to glassware to everything in between.

00:23:29.165 --> 00:23:32.566
Also there's food, there's
spices, there are all sorts

00:23:32.566 --> 00:23:36.733
of textiles and pillows and
lots and lots of glassware.

00:23:37.696 --> 00:23:40.434
Everything you can imagine
that is from Turkey,

00:23:40.434 --> 00:23:42.738
you will find at the Grand Bazaar.

00:23:42.738 --> 00:23:45.293
What sets this market
apart from other markets

00:23:45.293 --> 00:23:47.790
or other bazaars is it's
housed within this ancient

00:23:47.790 --> 00:23:50.707
structure which dates back to 1455.

00:23:51.571 --> 00:23:54.362
Not only are there so
many things for sale,

00:23:54.362 --> 00:23:58.359
and just a browsing
paradise but you also have

00:23:58.359 --> 00:23:59.942
a piece of history.

00:24:00.783 --> 00:24:02.680
Chai, please, yes.
- Two?

00:24:02.680 --> 00:24:05.449
- [Mark] One, two, yes, please.

00:24:05.449 --> 00:24:08.949
(speaks foreign language)

00:24:16.531 --> 00:24:17.972
Thank you.

00:24:17.972 --> 00:24:19.267
(speaks foreign language)

00:24:19.267 --> 00:24:20.417
- [Mark and Ying] Thailand.

00:24:20.417 --> 00:24:21.571
- [Man] Thailand.

00:24:21.571 --> 00:24:23.442
(speaks foreign language)

00:24:23.442 --> 00:24:25.859
- Taiwan.
- Thailand, Bangkok.

00:24:30.876 --> 00:24:33.290
That's some nice strong tea.

00:24:33.290 --> 00:24:34.623
Mm, that's good.

00:24:50.225 --> 00:24:52.242
We have been walking around
the Grand Bazaar for awhile

00:24:52.242 --> 00:24:54.274
and we are pretty worn out
so we are catching an Uber

00:24:54.274 --> 00:24:55.728
back to the hotel.

00:24:55.728 --> 00:24:57.910
Gonna rest for a little while
and then go back out again

00:24:57.910 --> 00:24:58.827
for dinner.

00:25:00.125 --> 00:25:01.421
Hello, is it Uber?

00:25:01.421 --> 00:25:03.903
Yes, okay, thank you.

00:25:03.903 --> 00:25:06.403
(chill music)

00:25:17.629 --> 00:25:20.074
We are waiting at the
bus stop this evening.

00:25:20.074 --> 00:25:22.634
Gonna try to take a bus to an area of town

00:25:22.634 --> 00:25:24.467
to eat dinner tonight.

00:25:26.161 --> 00:25:28.522
Traffic is pretty heavy and
our bus is pretty packed,

00:25:28.522 --> 00:25:30.689
but we are on our way now.

00:25:34.802 --> 00:25:36.119
It didn't take too long.

00:25:36.119 --> 00:25:40.528
We got off the bus, I think
this area's called Ortakoy

00:25:40.528 --> 00:25:44.695
and we are going to go to a
restaurant around this area.

00:25:48.360 --> 00:25:51.610
Oh, this is the place right here, Ying.

00:25:53.543 --> 00:25:55.917
This restaurant specializes both in kebabs

00:25:55.917 --> 00:25:59.571
but the main reason I came
here was to eat lahmacun

00:25:59.571 --> 00:26:03.488
which is a flat dough
which is topped with meat

00:26:05.152 --> 00:26:07.743
and it's a very famous Turkish dish.

00:26:07.743 --> 00:26:12.670
I'm starting off with ayran
which is a yogurt drink I think.

00:26:12.670 --> 00:26:15.716
(speaks foreign language)

00:26:15.716 --> 00:26:17.966
Mm, that is sour and salty.

00:26:19.896 --> 00:26:23.584
And very rich and buttery, that's good,

00:26:23.584 --> 00:26:27.095
that will go good with the tomato-y bread.

00:26:27.095 --> 00:26:30.549
Also to start with I got a
kubbeh and this is a very

00:26:30.549 --> 00:26:34.438
common kind of snack in
parts of Levant as well.

00:26:34.438 --> 00:26:37.587
I think it's bulgur wheat
with meat on the inside.

00:26:37.587 --> 00:26:41.673
I'm gonna squeeze a bunch of lemon on it.

00:26:41.673 --> 00:26:42.506
All right.

00:26:46.327 --> 00:26:48.290
That is one of the more
delicious version that I've had.

00:26:48.290 --> 00:26:50.360
It's packed with meat, you can taste lots

00:26:50.360 --> 00:26:51.943
of onions in there.

00:26:56.227 --> 00:26:58.060
Mmm, that's delicious.

00:27:01.394 --> 00:27:03.977
- Photo?
- Yes, photo and video.

00:27:04.816 --> 00:27:05.649
Thank you.

00:27:06.598 --> 00:27:07.930
Wow.

00:27:07.930 --> 00:27:11.430
(speaks foreign language)

00:27:17.668 --> 00:27:20.918
This is the lahmacun which this
place is really famous for.

00:27:20.918 --> 00:27:23.300
Ying already had a piece, she enjoyed it.

00:27:23.300 --> 00:27:25.546
We got the spicy version so
there's chilies on there,

00:27:25.546 --> 00:27:29.346
I think there's some zaatar
as well or some kind of herb.

00:27:29.346 --> 00:27:33.429
It is fired in a burning
oven and it's very thin.

00:27:34.727 --> 00:27:36.709
It's almost like cracker thin.

00:27:36.709 --> 00:27:38.813
I think what I see people
do is first squeeze

00:27:38.813 --> 00:27:40.631
on some lemon.

00:27:40.631 --> 00:27:43.798
I'm gonna squeeze on a bunch of lemon.

00:27:44.717 --> 00:27:49.184
Then I think you're supposed
to sort of roll it up,

00:27:49.184 --> 00:27:52.601
pick out the seed and eat it like a roll.

00:28:01.461 --> 00:28:02.294
Oh, yeah.

00:28:04.406 --> 00:28:08.525
The bread is very thin
and a little bit crispy

00:28:08.525 --> 00:28:10.993
but then a little bit
chewy at the same time.

00:28:10.993 --> 00:28:13.098
You can taste that minced meat.

00:28:13.098 --> 00:28:15.385
You can taste the herb in there.

00:28:15.385 --> 00:28:17.342
When I ordered this dish, I had no idea

00:28:17.342 --> 00:28:19.070
it was going to be this big.

00:28:19.070 --> 00:28:21.253
On the menu in the little
photo, it looked like

00:28:21.253 --> 00:28:23.594
it was about half this size.

00:28:23.594 --> 00:28:27.177
This is giant and it's
similar to a calzone

00:28:28.287 --> 00:28:30.358
but then quite different as well.

00:28:30.358 --> 00:28:32.627
It's shaped like a boat or like a trough

00:28:32.627 --> 00:28:35.710
and just filled with
meat and I think tomatoes

00:28:35.710 --> 00:28:38.045
and maybe parsley in there and then baked

00:28:38.045 --> 00:28:40.260
in an oven as well.

00:28:40.260 --> 00:28:43.760
Look at that, that's just like meat bread.

00:28:48.525 --> 00:28:51.529
Mmm, that bread is
definitely a lot thicker

00:28:51.529 --> 00:28:55.362
than a lahmacun and it's
more of a chewy bread

00:28:56.733 --> 00:28:58.927
but then very, very crusty.

00:28:58.927 --> 00:29:02.151
That's just like pure meat and bread.

00:29:02.151 --> 00:29:04.734
But really good meat and bread.

00:29:06.021 --> 00:29:08.354
Follow that with some ayran.

00:29:11.469 --> 00:29:13.396
That's a good combination.

00:29:13.396 --> 00:29:16.074
And then finally the last dish I ordered

00:29:16.074 --> 00:29:19.122
and I actually had no
idea what I was ordering.

00:29:19.122 --> 00:29:22.377
But this is their special kebab here.

00:29:22.377 --> 00:29:25.583
It almost looks like a Chimichanga plate,

00:29:25.583 --> 00:29:28.536
but there's a kebab inside
and that's wrapped in dough

00:29:28.536 --> 00:29:30.203
and then also baked.

00:29:31.107 --> 00:29:33.157
Oh and there's cheese in here too.

00:29:33.157 --> 00:29:33.990
Oh wow.

00:29:43.400 --> 00:29:44.233
Wow.

00:29:46.026 --> 00:29:48.551
That is the winner right there.

00:29:48.551 --> 00:29:52.718
Kebab, and cheese stuffed
within a piece of dough.

00:29:55.500 --> 00:29:59.586
Then roasted in that oven
and maybe with a little bit

00:29:59.586 --> 00:30:02.898
of a tomato sauce on top
and some sesame seeds.

00:30:02.898 --> 00:30:04.231
That is awesome.

00:30:07.898 --> 00:30:10.202
For my next piece of lahmacun,
I'm gonna add a bunch

00:30:10.202 --> 00:30:11.869
of vegetables to it.

00:30:12.830 --> 00:30:15.134
Stick this all into the middle.

00:30:15.134 --> 00:30:19.115
I think this is what
most people are doing.

00:30:19.115 --> 00:30:23.032
And then I'm gonna go on
with some lemon again.

00:30:25.395 --> 00:30:26.513
That lemon is almost finished.

00:30:26.513 --> 00:30:29.140
Let me grab the other lemon.

00:30:29.140 --> 00:30:31.723
This will be like a salad roll.

00:30:34.381 --> 00:30:36.881
The lemon is the touch I love.

00:30:38.301 --> 00:30:41.384
And then again just wrap this all up.

00:30:43.074 --> 00:30:44.333
This is a very popular restaurant.

00:30:44.333 --> 00:30:46.418
They are getting a lot of takeaway orders

00:30:46.418 --> 00:30:48.335
as we are sitting here.

00:30:50.995 --> 00:30:51.828
Oh yeah.

00:30:55.979 --> 00:30:58.812
A cracker, thin crust, salad roll.

00:30:59.753 --> 00:31:01.829
That was another great meal
and all three of the things

00:31:01.829 --> 00:31:05.336
I ordered were much different
and I've had this problem

00:31:05.336 --> 00:31:09.315
since coming to Turkey
that I've been kind of over

00:31:09.315 --> 00:31:11.731
ordering I think because
maybe I'm accustomed

00:31:11.731 --> 00:31:14.714
to Asian food so much where,
well especially in Thailand

00:31:14.714 --> 00:31:16.046
where the portions are kind of small.

00:31:16.046 --> 00:31:19.468
So you order like five or six
dishes between Ying and I.

00:31:19.468 --> 00:31:21.354
We always order five or six dishes.

00:31:21.354 --> 00:31:25.521
Here, they are huge and I
was imagining that trough

00:31:27.190 --> 00:31:29.995
to be like only a quarter of the size.

00:31:29.995 --> 00:31:33.020
I could not finish all of that bread.

00:31:33.020 --> 00:31:35.875
Had to get a takeaway
bag and I'm gonna bring

00:31:35.875 --> 00:31:39.013
that back to the hotel with
us for breakfast tomorrow.

00:31:39.013 --> 00:31:41.838
A shout out to CulinaryBackstreets.com

00:31:41.838 --> 00:31:43.506
for this recommendation.

00:31:43.506 --> 00:31:45.058
That's where I found this place.

00:31:45.058 --> 00:31:46.500
This is a great place.

00:31:46.500 --> 00:31:48.029
I'm gonna end the video now.

00:31:48.029 --> 00:31:49.760
We're just gonna head back.

00:31:49.760 --> 00:31:52.492
Thank you all very much
for watching today's video.

00:31:52.492 --> 00:31:54.740
It's been an amazing food day actually.

00:31:54.740 --> 00:31:56.776
We've eaten, I think
I've tried quite a few

00:31:56.776 --> 00:32:00.898
different dishes and
wandered around Istanbul.

00:32:00.898 --> 00:32:02.774
Another fantastic day.
