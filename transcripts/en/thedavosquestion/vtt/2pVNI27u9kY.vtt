00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.250
&gt;&gt; Thanks.
I want to answer the question about whether

00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:06.189
the rich countries are
doing enough to help the poorest countries.

00:00:06.189 --> 00:00:10.599
First off, I believe that even in this global
downturn and deep

00:00:10.599 --> 00:00:13.440
recession, that we've had in the UK, a huge
problem with our budget

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.650
deficit, we should protect what we spend on
overseas aid.

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:21.150
And the target we have for .7 percent of GDP,
and we should keep that.

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.140
Britain is a compassionate, generous nation
as we showing in terming of

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.070
the giving to Haiti.
We should continue with that.

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:31.369
But why is it that we haven't done better
in Haiti?

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:33.300
It's amazing some of the things that are being
done.

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.520
The pictures we see of children being pulled
from the rubble has made

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.460
us proud of what our emergency services are
able to do there.

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:45.050
And I do think the UN and individual countries
as well need to think

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:51.050
more about how we can have a standing ready-to-go
emergency force so

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:56.230
that we make sure that in the vital, golden,
first few hours after an

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:59.270
earthquake or another natural disaster we
save as many lives as

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:02.790
possible.
I raised this in the House of Commons with

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:03.790
the Prime Minister Gordon
Brown.

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:05.340
I think there's more we can do both in the
UK and internationally.

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:09.440
And I think that should be a real priority
as we start to learn the

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.690
lesson of how we can do even better when the
next Haiti strikes.
