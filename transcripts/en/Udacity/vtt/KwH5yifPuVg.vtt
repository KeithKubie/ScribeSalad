So we just finished talking about the sign in flow. Now, we're going to talk

00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:06.350
about a second concrete improvement of how to make the UX of your app

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:10.870
better. And that is with the checkout form. So if you have an application

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:12.800
that involves your users buying something from

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.760
you, then this step is really important.

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:20.040
&gt;&gt; Yeah, and this is actually a point where 70%

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:25.460
of users on average on the Internet. Drop off meaning that

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:28.310
there's 70% abandonment rate of shopping carts across the

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:31.240
web. That's a huge number. That means like three

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:33.670
out of ten people are actually making it through

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:35.460
this form. When they see this form the first

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.690
reaction that people have is they run away. So,

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:40.890
so how do you actually make this form better

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.020
since it's such a critical part of you actually

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.940
getting paid. We need to make it easier for users.

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.230
&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly. So how would you improve this form?

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:53.778
So, would you add more steps, for example?

00:00:53.778 --> 00:00:55.679
Instead of having a single page with all

00:00:55.679 --> 00:00:59.600
this information about building information, shipping information, credit

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.160
card information. Would you break it out into multiple

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.970
steps? Or would you improve the visual layout

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:09.970
of this form. Would you add more spacing,

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:11.960
bigger fonts, and make it so that people

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.810
can more easily type information in this thing. Or,

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.940
my favorite, would you actually add more text boxes to this form. because, you

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:23.260
know, that's the one thing that people like to do is fill out more

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:27.620
information on tiny, tiny mobile screens. Or

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:29.440
would you rather just replace this form

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:31.860
entirely with a pre-canned solution, like check

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.580
out with Google, or with PayPal, or Amazon.
