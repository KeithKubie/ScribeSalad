00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:03.690
One of you all sent a fairly
interesting problem, so I

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:05.360
thought I would work it out.

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:08.430
The problem is I have a
group of 30 people, so

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:09.580
30 people in a room.

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:13.820
They're randomly
selected 30 people.

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:22.490
And the question is what is the
probability that at least 2

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:29.640
people have the same birthday?

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.930
This is kind of a fun question
because that's the size

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:33.680
of a lot of classrooms.

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.260
What's the probability that at
least someone in the classroom

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:40.200
shares a birthday with someone
else in the classroom?

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.740
That's a good way
to phrase as well.

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:45.720
This is the same thing as
saying, what is the probability

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:53.820
that someone shares with
at least someone else.

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.570
They could share it with 2
other people or 4 other

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:56.420
people in the birthday.

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:06.260
And at first this problem seems
really hard because there's

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.810
a lot of circumstances
that makes this true.

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.270
I could have exactly 2 people
have the same birthday.

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:14.170
I could have exactly 3 people
have the same birthday.

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:17.060
I could have exactly 29 people
have the same birthday and all

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:20.500
of these make this true, so do
I add the probability of each

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:21.830
of those circumstances?

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:24.990
And then add them up and then
that becomes really hard.

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.510
And then I would have to
say, OK, whose birthdays

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:27.280
and I comparing?

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:28.020
And I would have to
do combinations.

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.200
It becomes a really difficult
problem unless you make kind

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:37.560
of one very simplifying
take on the problem.

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.310
This is the opposite of--
well let me draw the

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.810
probability space.

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:46.250
Let's say that this is
all of the outcomes.

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:47.630
Let me draw it with
a thicker line.

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:53.770
So let's say that's all
of the outcomes of my

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:54.630
probability space.

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.590
So that's 100% of the outcomes.

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:04.000
We want to know-- let me draw
it in a color that won't

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.680
be offensive to you.

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.030
That doesn't look that
great, but anyway.

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.620
Let's say that this is the
probability, this area right

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.250
here-- and I don't know
how big it really is,

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.070
we'll figure it out.

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:18.140
Let's say that this is the
probability that someone

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.220
shares a birthday with
at least someone else.

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:23.410
What's this area over here?

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:25.080
What's this green area?

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.970
Well, that means if these are
all the cases where someone

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:31.170
shares a birthday with someone
else, these are all the area

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:32.850
where no one shares a
birthday with anyone.

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:45.735
Or you could say, all 30 people
have different birthdays.

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:53.850
This is what we're
trying to figure out.

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:56.500
I'll just call it the
probability that

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:57.630
someone shares.

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:00.170
I'll call it the probability
of sharing, probability of s.

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:08.540
If this whole area is area 1 or
area 100%, this green area

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:14.760
right here, this is going
to be 1 minus p of s.

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.540
This is going to be
1 minus p of s.

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:20.200
Or if we said that this is the
probability-- or another way we

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.310
could say it, actually this is
the best way to think about it.

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:24.780
If this is different, so
this is the probability

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:26.610
of different birthdays.

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:28.770
This is the probability
that all 30 people have

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:30.410
30 different birthdays.

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:32.300
No one shares with anyone.

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:36.630
The probability that someone
shares with someone else plus

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:39.460
the probability that no one
shares with anyone-- they all

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:42.960
have distinct birthdays--
that's got to be equal to 1.

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:44.950
Because we're either going to
be in this situation or we're

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:45.990
going to be in that situation.

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:47.670
Or you can say they're
equal to 100%.

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:51.191
Either way, 100% and 1
are the same number.

00:03:51.191 --> 00:03:53.460
It's equal to 100%.

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:56.990
So if we figure out the
probability that everyone has

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:59.830
the same birthday we could
subtract it from 100.

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:00.710
So let's see.

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:02.090
We could we just rewrite this.

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:04.710
The probability that someone
shares a birthday with someone

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:11.390
else, that's equal to 100%
minus the probability that

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:15.080
everyone has distinct,
separate birthdays.

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:18.190
And the reason why I'm doing
that is because as I started

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:20.190
off in the video, this is
kind of hard to figure out.

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:23.140
You know, I can figure out the
probability that 2 people have

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:26.520
the same birthday, 5 people,
and it becomes very confusing.

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.560
But here, if I wanted to just
figure out the probability that

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:31.860
everyone has a distinct
birthday, it's actually a much

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:34.190
easier probability
to solve for.

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:35.830
So what's the probability
that everyone has a

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:37.440
distinct birthday?

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:38.300
So let's think about it.

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:43.880
Person one.

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:46.370
Just for simplicity, let's
imagine the case that we only

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:47.790
have 2 people in the room.

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:51.770
What's the probably that they
have different birthdays?

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:57.870
Let's see, person one, their
birthday could be 365 days

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:00.520
out of 365 days of the year.

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:02.390
You know, whenever
their birthday is.

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:06.440
And then person two, if we
wanted to ensure that they

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:09.340
don't have the same birthday,
how many days could

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:10.720
person two be born on?

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:13.130
Well, it could be born
on any day that person

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:14.240
one was not born on.

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:19.080
So there are 364
possibilities out 365.

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:21.550
So if you had 2 people, the
probability that no one

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:23.110
is born on the same
birthday-- this is just 1.

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:30.330
It's just going to be
equal to 364/365.

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:33.740
Now what happens if
we had 3 people?

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:35.470
So first of all the
first person could

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:38.280
be born on any day.

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:42.990
Then the second person could
be born on 364 possible

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:45.390
days out of 365.

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:49.220
And then the third person,
what's the probability that

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:51.810
the third person isn't
born on either of these

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:52.620
people birthdays?

00:05:52.620 --> 00:06:03.110
So 2 days are taken up, so
the probability is 363/365.

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:04.330
You multiply them out.

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:11.480
You get 365 times 36-- actually
I should rewrite this one.

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:14.420
Instead of saying this is 1,
let me write this as-- the

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:21.370
numerator is 365 times
364 over 365 squared.

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:23.140
Because I want you
to see the pattern.

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:30.640
Here the probability is 365
times 364 times 363 over

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:35.610
365 to the third power.

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:41.100
And so, in general, if you just
kept doing this to 30, if I

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:47.610
just kept this process for 30
people-- the probability that

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:55.560
no one shares the same birthday
would be equal to 365 times 364

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:59.280
times 363-- I'll have
30 terms up here.

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:01.760
All the way down to what?

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:07.120
All the way down to 336.

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:15.810
That'll actually be 30
terms divided by 365

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:17.380
to the 30th power.

00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:19.220
And you can just type this into
your calculator right now.

00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:21.910
It'll take you a little time to
type in 30 numbers, and you'll

00:07:21.910 --> 00:07:25.960
get the probability that no one
shares the same birthday

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:27.700
with anyone else.

00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:29.900
But before we do that let
me just show you something

00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:31.250
that might make it a
little bit easier.

00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:33.970
Is there any way that I can
mathematically express

00:07:33.970 --> 00:07:35.130
this with factorials?

00:07:35.130 --> 00:07:38.730
Or that I could mathematically
express this with factorials?

00:07:38.730 --> 00:07:40.380
Let's think about it.

00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:44.120
365 factorial is what?

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:55.320
365 factorial is equal to 365
times 364 times 363 times--

00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:56.710
all the way down to 1.

00:07:56.710 --> 00:07:57.870
You just keep multiplying.

00:07:57.870 --> 00:08:00.040
It's a huge number.

00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:03.830
Now, if I just want the 365
times the 364 in this case,

00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:07.610
I have to get rid of all of
these numbers back here.

00:08:07.610 --> 00:08:10.690
One thing I could do is I
could divide this thing

00:08:10.690 --> 00:08:12.140
by all of these numbers.

00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:17.630
So 363 times 362-- all
the way down to 1.

00:08:17.630 --> 00:08:23.820
So that's the same thing as
dividing by 363 factorial.

00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:27.370
365 factorial divided by 363
factorial is essentially this

00:08:27.370 --> 00:08:31.260
because all of these
terms cancel out.

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:38.230
So this is equal to 365
factorial over 363 factorial

00:08:38.230 --> 00:08:40.725
over 365 squared.

00:08:40.725 --> 00:08:42.870
And of course, for this case,
it's almost silly to worry

00:08:42.870 --> 00:08:45.000
about the factorials, but it
becomes useful once we have

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.230
something larger than
two terms up here.

00:08:47.230 --> 00:08:50.940
So by the same logic, this
right here is going to be equal

00:08:50.940 --> 00:09:01.780
to 365 factorial over 362
factorial over 365 squared.

00:09:01.780 --> 00:09:03.390
And actually, just another
interesting point.

00:09:03.390 --> 00:09:05.580
How did we get this 365?

00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:08.620
Sorry, how did we get
this 363 factorial?

00:09:08.620 --> 00:09:12.250
Well, 365 minus 2
is 363, right?

00:09:12.250 --> 00:09:15.940
And that makes sense because we
only wanted two terms up here.

00:09:15.940 --> 00:09:17.670
We only wanted two
terms right here.

00:09:17.670 --> 00:09:21.760
So we wanted to divide by a
factorial that's two less.

00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:24.670
And so we'd only get the
highest two terms left.

00:09:24.670 --> 00:09:28.180
This is also equal to-- you
could write this as 365

00:09:28.180 --> 00:09:36.870
factorial divided by 365 minus
2 factorial 365 minus 2 is 363

00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:39.210
factorial and then you just end
up with those two terms

00:09:39.210 --> 00:09:40.630
and that's that there.

00:09:40.630 --> 00:09:45.580
And then likewise, this right
here, this numerator you could

00:09:45.580 --> 00:09:54.980
rewrite as 365 factorial
divided by 365 minus 3-- and

00:09:54.980 --> 00:09:58.190
we had 3 people-- factorial.

00:09:58.190 --> 00:09:59.380
And that should hopefully
make sense, right?

00:09:59.380 --> 00:10:04.780
This is the same thing as 365
factorial-- well 365 divided

00:10:04.780 --> 00:10:08.090
by 3 is 362 factorial.

00:10:08.090 --> 00:10:13.430
And so that's equal to
365 times 364 times

00:10:13.430 --> 00:10:16.380
363 all the way down.

00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:20.550
Divided by 362 times
all the way down.

00:10:20.550 --> 00:10:22.870
And that'll cancel out with
everything else and you'd

00:10:22.870 --> 00:10:24.860
be just left with that.

00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:26.600
And that's that right there.

00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:35.190
So by that same logic, this top
part here can be written as

00:10:35.190 --> 00:10:41.160
365 factorial over what?

00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:46.660
365 minus 30 factorial.

00:10:46.660 --> 00:10:49.360
And I did all of that just so
I could show you kind of the

00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:52.200
pattern and because this is
frankly easier to type into a

00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:54.700
calculator if you know where
the factorial button is.

00:10:54.700 --> 00:10:58.330
So let's figure out what
this entire probability is.

00:10:58.330 --> 00:11:01.710
So turning on the calculator,
we want-- so let's

00:11:01.710 --> 00:11:02.790
do the numerator.

00:11:02.790 --> 00:11:09.820
365 factorial divided by--
well, what's 365 minus 30?

00:11:09.820 --> 00:11:12.020
That's 335.

00:11:12.020 --> 00:11:19.560
Divided by 335 factorial and
that's the whole numerator.

00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:25.630
And now we want to divide
the numerator by 365

00:11:25.630 --> 00:11:29.610
to the 30th power.

00:11:29.610 --> 00:11:34.100
Let the calculator think
and we get 0.2936.

00:11:34.100 --> 00:11:37.990
Equals 0.2936.

00:11:37.990 --> 00:11:45.350
Actually 37 if you rounded,
which is equal to 29.37%.

00:11:45.350 --> 00:11:48.550
Now, just so you remember what
we were doing all along, this

00:11:48.550 --> 00:11:52.610
was the probability that no one
shares a birthday with anyone.

00:11:52.610 --> 00:11:56.180
This was the probability of
everyone having distinct,

00:11:56.180 --> 00:11:58.090
different birthdays
from everyone else.

00:11:58.090 --> 00:12:00.580
And we said, well, the
probability that someone shares

00:12:00.580 --> 00:12:03.930
a birthday with someone else,
or maybe more than one person,

00:12:03.930 --> 00:12:07.830
is equal to all of the
possibilities-- kind of the

00:12:07.830 --> 00:12:12.800
100%, the probability space,
minus the probability that no

00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:15.030
one shares a birthday
with anybody.

00:12:15.030 --> 00:12:20.990
So that's equal to
100% minus 29.37%.

00:12:20.990 --> 00:12:25.660
Or another way you could write
it as that's 1 minus 0.2937,

00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:29.860
which is equal to-- so if I
want to subtract that from 1.

00:12:29.860 --> 00:12:34.330
1 minus-- that just
means the answer.

00:12:34.330 --> 00:12:37.280
That means 1 minus 0.29.

00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:40.630
You get 0.7063.

00:12:40.630 --> 00:12:43.720
So the probability that someone
shares a birthday with someone

00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:47.420
else is 0.7063--
it keeps going.

00:12:47.420 --> 00:12:53.090
Which is approximately
equal to 70.6%.

00:12:53.090 --> 00:12:56.250
Which is kind of a neat result
because if you have 30 people

00:12:56.250 --> 00:12:58.030
in a room you might say,
oh wow, what are the odds

00:12:58.030 --> 00:12:59.580
that someone has the same
birthday as someone else?

00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:02.170
It's actually pretty high.

00:13:02.170 --> 00:13:04.870
70% of the time, if you have a
group of 30 people, at least 1

00:13:04.870 --> 00:13:07.500
person shares a birthday
with at least one other

00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:08.260
person in the room.

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:10.990
So that's kind of
a neat problem.

00:13:10.990 --> 00:13:12.950
And kind of a neat result
at the same time.

00:13:12.950 --> 00:13:15.740
Anyway, see you in
the next video.
