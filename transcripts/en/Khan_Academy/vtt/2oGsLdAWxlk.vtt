00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:04.640
Determine whether the
ordered pairs 3 comma 5 and 1

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:09.740
comma negative 7 are solutions
to the inequality 5x minus 3y

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:14.040
is greater than or equal to 25.

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.060
So again, let me just try
each of these ordered pairs.

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:19.290
We could try what happens
when x is equal to 3

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:21.720
and y is equal to 5
in this inequality

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.314
and see if it satisfies it.

00:00:23.314 --> 00:00:25.230
And then we could try
it for 1 and negative 7.

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.220
So let's do that first.

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:29.750
Let's do it first for 3 and 5.

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:31.970
So when x is 3, y is 5.

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:34.410
Let's see if this
actually gets satisfied.

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.176
So we get 5 times 3.

00:00:39.176 --> 00:00:40.050
Let me color code it.

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:45.070
So this is 5-- I didn't want to
do it in that color-- 5 times

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:52.200
3 minus 3 times 5.

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:02.640
Let's see if this is
greater than or equal to 25.

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.900
So 5 times 3 is 15.

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:09.350
And then from that, we're
going to subtract 15,

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:12.915
and let's see if that is
greater than or equal to 25.

00:01:12.915 --> 00:01:15.150
Put that question mark
there because we don't know.

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.700
And 15 minus 15, that is 0.

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.810
So we get the expression 0 is
greater than or equal to 25.

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:23.970
This is not true.

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.640
0 is less than 25.

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.580
So this is not true.

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:30.130
This is not true.

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:35.030
So this ordered pair is not
a solution to the inequality.

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:39.450
So this is not a solution.

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.810
You put in x is
3, y is 5, you get

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:43.840
0 is greater than
or equal to 25,

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.360
which is absolutely not true.

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:49.390
Now let's try it with
1 and negative 7.

00:01:49.390 --> 00:02:00.140
So we have 5 times 1
minus 3 times negative 7

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.120
needs to be greater
than or equal to 25.

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:07.120
5 times 1 is 5, and then
minus 3 times negative 7

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:08.229
is negative 21.

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:11.295
So it becomes minus
negative 21 is

00:02:11.295 --> 00:02:13.610
to be greater than
or equal to 25.

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.300
This is the same thing as
5 plus 21-- subtracting

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:20.170
a negative same thing as
adding the positive-- is

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.520
greater than or equal to 25.

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:29.510
And 5 plus 21 is 26 is indeed
greater than or equal to 25.

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:30.770
So this works out.

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:33.512
So this is a solution.

00:02:33.512 --> 00:02:34.970
And just to see if
we can visualize

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:38.287
this a little bit better, I'm
going to graph this inequality.

00:02:38.287 --> 00:02:40.620
I'm not going to show you
exactly how I do it this time,

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.280
but I'm going to show you
where these points lie relative

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:44.055
to this solution.

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:50.750
So we have 5-- let me
do this is a new color.

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:55.830
So we have 5x-- that's
not a new color.

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:57.530
Having trouble
switching colors today.

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:04.090
We have 5x minus 3y is
greater than or equal to 25.

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:05.590
Let me write this
inequality in kind

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:06.927
of our slope-intercept form.

00:03:06.927 --> 00:03:08.260
So this would be the same thing.

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.830
If we subtract 5x
from both sides,

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:14.020
we get negative
3y is greater than

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:18.510
or equal to negative 5x plus 25.

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.420
I just subtracted
5x from both sides.

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:23.850
So that gets eliminated, and you
have a negative 5x over here.

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:26.210
Now let's divide both
sides of this equation,

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:29.182
or I should say this
inequality, by negative 3.

00:03:29.182 --> 00:03:31.140
And when you divide both
sides of an inequality

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:33.730
by a negative number, multiply
or divide by a negative number,

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:35.580
it swaps the inequality.

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:37.360
So if you divide both
sides by negative 3,

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:42.920
you get y is less than or
equal to negative 5 divided

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:46.560
by negative 3 is 5 over 3x.

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:51.370
And then 25 divided by
negative 3 is minus 25/3.

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:57.860
So this is now the
expression or the inequality,

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:03.850
y is less than or equal
to 5/3 x minus 25/3.

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:05.930
So if I wanted to
graph this-- I'll

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:08.224
try to draw a relatively
rough graph here,

00:04:08.224 --> 00:04:10.140
but really just so that
we can visualize this.

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:17.740
So our y-intercept
is negative 25/3.

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:20.380
That's the same thing
as negative 8 and 1/3.

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:24.240
So that's 1, 2,
3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:25.650
and a little bit more than 8.

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:30.120
So our y-intercept is
negative 8 and 1/3 like that.

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:32.860
And it has a slope of 5/3.

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:36.320
So that means for every 3 it
goes to the right, it rises 5.

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:41.120
So it goes 1, 2, 3, it rises 5.

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:43.515
So the line is going to
look something like this.

00:04:43.515 --> 00:04:45.590
I'm drawing a very
rough version of it.

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:49.950
So the line will look something
like that, this line over here.

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:55.480
That's if it was a y is
equal to 5/3 x minus 25/3.

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:56.810
But here we have an inequality.

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:59.740
It's y is less than or equal to.

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:04.490
So for any x, the y's that
satisfy it are the y's

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:09.550
that equals 5/3 x minus 25/3--
that would be on the line,

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:10.970
so it would be
that point there--

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:12.820
and all the y's less than it.

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:16.360
So the solution is this
whole area right over here.

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:20.160
Since it's less than or equal
to, we can include the line.

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:22.360
The equal to allows us
to include the line,

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:25.260
and the less than tells us we're
going to go below the line.

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:26.931
And we can verify
that by looking

00:05:26.931 --> 00:05:28.180
at these two points over here.

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:31.870
We saw that 3 comma 5 is
not part of the solution.

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:35.010
So 3 comma 5 is 1, 2--
it's right about there

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:35.760
and then up 5.

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:39.252
So 3 comma 5 is
right above here.

00:05:39.252 --> 00:05:40.710
It's in this region
above the line,

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:42.590
and notice not part
of the solution.

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:48.610
And then 1 comma negative 7 is
going to be right over here.

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:50.020
It's almost on the line.

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:54.630
So 1 comma negative 7 is
going to be right over there.

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:58.016
But it is, at least,
within this solution area.

00:05:58.016 --> 00:06:00.140
So hopefully that gives
you a little bit more sense

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:01.514
of how to visualize
these things.

00:06:01.514 --> 00:06:05.200
And we'll cover this in more
detail in future videos.
