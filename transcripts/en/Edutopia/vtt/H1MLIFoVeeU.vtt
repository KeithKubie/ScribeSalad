00:00:01.076 --> 00:00:06.786
&gt;&gt;Joseph: At High Tech High School
we have all races, ethnicities,

00:00:06.786 --> 00:00:08.606
sexual preferences in the building.

00:00:09.576 --> 00:00:11.186
Everybody is a family.

00:00:11.346 --> 00:00:13.966
That's the beauty of being in High Tech.

00:00:20.936 --> 00:00:25.466
&gt;&gt;Louis: There's always a period of
adjustment when kids change schools,

00:00:25.466 --> 00:00:29.076
but especially when they go from
a grammar school into high school.

00:00:29.636 --> 00:00:33.856
Many of the kids are coming here
without knowing other students,

00:00:33.856 --> 00:00:37.226
or at least not many other students
as compared to if they remained

00:00:37.226 --> 00:00:39.976
in their neighborhood schools.

00:00:39.976 --> 00:00:42.636
&gt;&gt;Joseph: To get in tune to
the culture of the school,

00:00:43.376 --> 00:00:47.336
we have a school orientation
class in freshman year.

00:00:48.956 --> 00:00:51.136
&gt;&gt;Max: Freshman orientation
was a bit scary actually,

00:00:51.196 --> 00:00:54.196
because I didn't know what to expect.

00:00:54.196 --> 00:00:56.636
I went to a small, tiny
little charter school.

00:00:56.636 --> 00:00:59.086
It was a big jump, so there was
like a lot more people here.

00:00:59.286 --> 00:01:01.636
I got sort of a glimpse of
how everyone was inviting

00:01:01.636 --> 00:01:03.476
and everyone was sort of
wanting to help me out.

00:01:05.036 --> 00:01:09.466
&gt;&gt;Louis: I meet all of the freshmen
once a week throughout the entire year.

00:01:10.126 --> 00:01:13.976
One of the things that I try
to stress with our students is

00:01:13.976 --> 00:01:17.676
that we are a school of compassion.

00:01:18.346 --> 00:01:22.806
A lot of what I do in the guidance class
is based upon that, enabling the kids

00:01:22.836 --> 00:01:27.726
to see different points of
view, so people are accustomed

00:01:27.726 --> 00:01:29.436
to the diversity we have here.

00:01:29.526 --> 00:01:34.666
I start out the year basically with an
exercise with them called the hot seat.

00:01:35.036 --> 00:01:38.486
On a voluntary basis, a kid will
sit in the middle of a circle

00:01:38.486 --> 00:01:42.216
and the other students will have a
chance to ask him anything they want.

00:01:42.496 --> 00:01:45.866
No questions that embarrass a person
or make them feel uncomfortable,

00:01:46.356 --> 00:01:49.516
and the person in the middle has
the right to not answer anything.

00:01:51.716 --> 00:01:54.686
I try to talk to them about
their individual responsibility,

00:01:54.716 --> 00:02:01.746
about everything from teen pregnancy
and STDs to the bullying and the racism.

00:02:03.266 --> 00:02:08.106
I spend a good deal of time dealing
with how does peer pressure affect us?

00:02:08.576 --> 00:02:12.076
Some of the kids are more shy, they
don't talk as much in the beginning.

00:02:12.376 --> 00:02:17.806
So as I get to know them over the
whole year, I get a chance to find

00:02:17.806 --> 00:02:19.976
out what the difficulties
are they may have.

00:02:20.166 --> 00:02:22.806
&gt;&gt;Chazz: I was an eighth grader,
a short little chubby kid came in

00:02:22.806 --> 00:02:24.586
and didn't know what to expect.

00:02:24.586 --> 00:02:27.156
Everything was so new, people
were just much bigger than me.

00:02:27.456 --> 00:02:30.246
It was overwhelming, and then
once I came in my freshman year,

00:02:30.246 --> 00:02:32.276
it was really nice just
having that, I guess,

00:02:32.276 --> 00:02:33.886
backbone of the community
in the classroom.

00:02:33.886 --> 00:02:36.756
&gt;&gt;Louis: I had to listen to it several
other times and it's not an easy story.

00:02:36.756 --> 00:02:40.706
&gt;&gt;We talk about racism that
has existed in our society,

00:02:40.706 --> 00:02:44.116
does racism still exist,
where do we see it?

00:02:44.186 --> 00:02:46.696
&gt;&gt;Why is he so passionate
about this, yes?

00:02:46.696 --> 00:02:50.436
&gt;&gt;Student: He has to say something and
stand up for his culture and his race

00:02:50.436 --> 00:02:53.276
because he feels that nothing
is being said about it.

00:02:53.446 --> 00:02:56.886
&gt;&gt;Louis: I do some exercises, break
the kids down into small groups.

00:02:57.226 --> 00:03:00.436
They discuss, come up with their
solution and then we return

00:03:00.436 --> 00:03:03.156
to a large group, get an
idea what other people think

00:03:03.156 --> 00:03:05.726
and where their opinions
are coming from.

00:03:05.806 --> 00:03:08.816
&gt;&gt;Student: It wasn't equal for
everyone to have their own opinion,

00:03:08.816 --> 00:03:12.566
so I think it's kind of like a wound
that was opened and never closed.

00:03:13.336 --> 00:03:15.016
&gt;&gt;Louis: In our class, they might find

00:03:15.016 --> 00:03:18.326
out some things they might not
talk about in other classes.

00:03:18.326 --> 00:03:21.806
I try to keep it more informal,
because it's not a graded class.

00:03:22.146 --> 00:03:24.886
It's just me and them and,
you know, we're talking.

00:03:25.636 --> 00:03:26.896
&gt;&gt;Do you think that's true?

00:03:26.896 --> 00:03:31.596
&gt;&gt;Student: I think it depends on
what person you're saying it to...

00:03:32.096 --> 00:03:34.686
&gt;&gt;Louis: I think it gives them a chance
at least to get to know me better.

00:03:34.686 --> 00:03:37.636
They know where I am and they know
they can come and see me any time.

00:03:38.616 --> 00:03:42.636
&gt;&gt;Joseph: The students get more involved
in the culture of the school and I think

00:03:43.286 --> 00:03:47.466
as the students progress from freshman,
to sophomore, junior, the senior year,

00:03:48.366 --> 00:03:53.606
they train the incoming students to make
sure that that culture stays in place.
