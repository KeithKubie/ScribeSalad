00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.330
-So now we have our keynote.

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:15.240
But rather than
have keynote speech,

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.220
we have keynote recast
as a conversation.

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.150
so we're very lucky to
have Janet Mock here, who

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.390
is a writer, cultural
commentator, advocate

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.008
for trans rights,
among other things.

00:00:30.008 --> 00:00:33.354
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:41.220
-So I guess I should say that
my first introduction to Janet

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:44.870
was when she gave a
speech the my daughter's

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:47.120
graduation in Pitzer last year.

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:50.890
And I was on the edge of my
seat, where I was actually

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:52.480
very impressed with
the whole concept

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:55.580
of multiple intersections
of narrative

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:56.955
for how people
define themselves.

00:00:56.955 --> 00:01:02.050
And I thought, this is the
person we want for the keynote.

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:04.019
So that was what convinced me.

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.730
She's also the author of
the autobiographical work,

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:11.340
Redefining Realness,
which my daughter gave me

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:12.870
for a Christmas present.

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:15.610
And I read, hanging
on every word.

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:19.430
And since this conference was
about language and gender,

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:24.530
I was also noting that she has
this exquisite ear and ability

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:29.620
to put into words different
forms of language.

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:31.380
So I guess we'll get
into her background.

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.420
But I just noted
for example, the way

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.820
he was able to capture a
kind of a matriarchal African

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:40.280
American dialect in Dallas, but
also kind of a trans language

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.370
that the one finds in Hawaii.

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:46.140
And it was just an amazing
journey for me to read this.

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.450
So I'm just saying I have
all these kind of markings

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:52.750
and underlines in
the book for that.

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:55.300
And interviewing
Janet is Moia Bailey,

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:58.750
who's a Dean's Fellow of Women's
Gender and Sexuality Studies

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:00.780
at Northeastern.

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.570
And we'll be interviewing Janet
as a kind of fire side chat.

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.730
And also uses her book as one of
the texts in her gender studies

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:13.490
class.

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:15.390
I had the great
privilege of having

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.870
a chance to chat with Moia
about this conference.

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.685
And I'll just turn
it over to Moia,

00:02:20.685 --> 00:02:23.120
and I think it's going
to be a great session.

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.630
Thank you.

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:24.213
-Thanks, John.

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:31.211
-Thank you all for
coming and being here.

00:02:31.211 --> 00:02:31.710
-I know.

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:32.890
Thank you.

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:34.680
-I'm really excited
to talk to you.

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:35.330
-Me too.

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:39.437
-So I wanted to start with
the book, because I too,

00:02:39.437 --> 00:02:41.270
fell in love with the
book after reading it.

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:43.010
I read it in one sitting.

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:45.750
And I was like, I know I need
to assign this to my women's

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:52.210
studies students because the
way that you talk about language

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:58.060
and gender, and sexuality
and race in really,

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:59.470
really nuanced ways.

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:01.810
But also in an accessible way.

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:04.950
I love that, and
my students do too.

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:05.870
-Thank you for that.

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:07.470
-You're welcome.

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:11.030
So Redefining Realness invokes
the language of clear in trans

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.710
communities.

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:14.500
And you write that
realness is the ability

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.400
to be seen as hetero normative,
to assimilate, to not

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.880
be read as other, or
deviate from the norm.

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:24.020
Realness means you
are extraordinary

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:27.120
in your embodiment of what
society deems normative.

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.410
To embody realness, rather
than performing or competing

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:33.620
realness, enables trans
women to enter spaces

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:36.150
with a lower risk
of being rebutted,

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.840
or questioned,
policed, or attacked.

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:41.530
Realness is a
pathway to survival.

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:43.950
And I just thought that
was a wonderful quote.

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:47.550
And giving people the
opportunity to take a

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:48.700
look at that.

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:51.560
How does your work continue
to redefine realness

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:53.872
for yourself and for others?

00:03:53.872 --> 00:03:55.580
-What's so interesting,
is the first time

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:59.540
I ever heard the term realness
was in Paris is Burning.

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:01.380
And I remember watching
it with girlfriends,

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:04.970
and we were teenagers, and just
kind of getting our entire life

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:05.470
from it.

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:08.820
Because we had never
seen parts of ourselves

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:12.860
reflected in a mainstream
product, in that kind of way.

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:15.860
Supposedly everyone saw
this when it came out.

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:18.870
And we couldn't believe
that these women existed

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:21.339
in another space beyond our own.

00:04:21.339 --> 00:04:23.790
That they were being
recorded and archived,

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:26.920
and their living history
was there and existed.

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:29.020
And we know how
powerful that is.

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:31.080
I remember when
Dorian Corey, who's

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:32.980
kind of like the
matriarch-- there's

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:35.470
a lot of matriarchs, a
lot of mothers of houses

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:40.866
in that film-- seeing
her break down the,

00:04:40.866 --> 00:04:44.330
not just the definition of
realness, which I shared there,

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:47.480
which is mostly linked
to being able to pass

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:53.790
in a dominant cisgender and
white and for New York City

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:56.330
street kids, rich society.

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:57.920
Being able to walk
on Park Avenue

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:01.000
and not have anyone clock
you, as we would say.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.850
So as [INAUDIBLE]
passing so strongly.

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:05.400
But for me, I think
the way that I've

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:07.610
tried to redefine realness
is to take it away

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:14.690
from just this idea of being
able to blend in as cisgender,

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:19.850
as non-trans, and
to kind of say what

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:21.540
is authentic and real to us.

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:23.980
Because I think that so
often for trans folk,

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:26.100
we're constantly-- and I
think even see this now

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:28.200
in a lot of movement
spaces-- we're

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:30.170
constantly trying
to just create space

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:35.350
to talk about just call me my
name, called me my pronouns.

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:38.120
And let me just respect that.

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:41.460
And so a lot of our arguments
are around language.

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:44.270
And as someone in media, I
expect to argue around language

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:49.120
oftentimes, because I'd dealing
as a public facing person,

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:52.480
talking on behalf of an
entire community of people

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:54.750
that are completely diverse.

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:57.060
And so for me,
realness is about kind

00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:59.100
of taking it more internal.

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:00.660
What is real to me?

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:03.660
And that's truth
and that's fact.

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:06.590
And no one gets to tell
you what real is for you.

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:08.420
What is authentic?

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:15.380
And no one gets to then
legitimize your truth.

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:17.890
And so that's what the
journey of writing that book

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:18.980
has often been about.

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:21.110
And that's what my work is.

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:24.040
Constantly battling
with at times,

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:26.030
because I find myself
in conversations

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:29.050
where-- I remember going
on The Colbert Report.

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:32.150
And he couldn't like,
his mind around the idea

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:36.260
that there's more than
he, she and her, hers.

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:41.190
And just was mind boggling.

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:43.470
And so like to have to do
that in mainstream spaces

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:46.870
to folk who are not initiated
in our conversations

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:50.300
around gender, is kind
of the multi-layered part

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:52.400
of some of that work.

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:54.370
-And I'm so grateful
for your text

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:56.930
as being a place where
you can send people now.

00:06:56.930 --> 00:06:59.570
So that you don't have to
do that education work.

00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:00.400
And talk to people.

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:02.170
-That gets me in
trouble too sometimes.

00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:05.700
Because I'm like, I
don't do 101, I'm sorry.

00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:06.710
-Read the book.

00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:07.665
Read the book.

00:07:07.665 --> 00:07:09.970
But related to
that, realness also

00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:12.200
makes me think about the
way you talk about passing.

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:17.300
And I wanted to play a clip, if
people can queue the clip where

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:19.790
you're talking about
what passing means,

00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:23.970
and how it is being used
in ways that don't actually

00:07:23.970 --> 00:07:27.255
talk about the realities
of trans lives.

00:07:27.255 --> 00:07:28.770
-I am woman.

00:07:28.770 --> 00:07:30.850
I live my life as
a woman, and that's

00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:32.040
how I should be perceived.

00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:35.582
I'm not passing as
anything, I'm being.

00:07:35.582 --> 00:07:36.360
Being myself.

00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:52.120
I have such a
complicated relationship

00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:54.760
with the concept
of passing, period.

00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:58.520
Not even applying it to
my own life, but just

00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:02.540
the idea that to pass
means that you're passing

00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:04.830
is something that you're not.

00:08:04.830 --> 00:08:09.450
Passing comes off as if you are
actively, because it's a verb.

00:08:09.450 --> 00:08:14.440
You're actively engaging in some
kind of trickery or deception.

00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:16.530
And so that's where I get
irritated with passing,

00:08:16.530 --> 00:08:18.710
because any time that
I walk on the street

00:08:18.710 --> 00:08:19.890
my gender is visible.

00:08:19.890 --> 00:08:21.000
I am a woman.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.370
People see me and
take me as a woman.

00:08:23.370 --> 00:08:25.940
And that is not passing,
that's me just being.

00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:30.070
But once I disclose that
I am trans, things change.

00:08:30.070 --> 00:08:31.310
And then I become an oddity.

00:08:31.310 --> 00:08:32.669
I become an object.

00:08:32.669 --> 00:08:34.799
Something that is
objectified and gawked over.

00:08:34.799 --> 00:08:36.630
And my humanity and
womanhood is then

00:08:36.630 --> 00:08:40.320
checked and put into question.

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:43.039
So I can just imagine
someone who does not

00:08:43.039 --> 00:08:46.830
have the conditional privilege
of passing having to have

00:08:46.830 --> 00:08:48.130
to deal with that all the time.

00:08:48.130 --> 00:08:52.500
So those are the
layered relationships

00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:55.200
with the lived experiences
of being a woman that

00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:57.125
is often seen as cis.

00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:03.170
-I hate watching
videos of myself.

00:09:03.170 --> 00:09:04.720
It's so bizarre.

00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:09.030
And so the book hadn't come out
yet, and me and my boyfriend

00:09:09.030 --> 00:09:11.750
at the time, Aaron,
who's now my husband,

00:09:11.750 --> 00:09:14.020
he was like, we should
probably do some little video

00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:14.820
things of you.

00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:19.315
Just introduce what some of
the themes of the book are.

00:09:19.315 --> 00:09:20.440
And I remember we did that.

00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:22.410
And he did that dress thing.

00:09:22.410 --> 00:09:23.790
That was me primping.

00:09:23.790 --> 00:09:25.290
That wasn't supposed
to be captured.

00:09:25.290 --> 00:09:27.970
But I just dedicating
myself to realness.

00:09:27.970 --> 00:09:31.210
I just let it be a part
of the conversation.

00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:35.550
-I think that is what
people love about you

00:09:35.550 --> 00:09:37.750
and what you bring
to the conversation.

00:09:37.750 --> 00:09:41.030
And taking that conversation
a little further,

00:09:41.030 --> 00:09:43.550
I want to just read
a bit of your quote

00:09:43.550 --> 00:09:45.585
about passing from the text.

00:09:45.585 --> 00:09:49.040
And you say, "these thoughts
surrounding identity, gender,

00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:53.940
bodies, and how we view,
judge, and objectify all women

00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:55.850
brings me to the
subject of passing.

00:09:55.850 --> 00:09:59.370
A term based on an assumption
that trans people are passing

00:09:59.370 --> 00:10:01.220
as something they're not.

00:10:01.220 --> 00:10:03.040
It's rooted in the
idea that we are not

00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:04.590
really who we say we are.

00:10:04.590 --> 00:10:08.100
That we are holding a secret,
that we are living false lives.

00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:11.520
Examples of people passing in
media, whether through race,

00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:16.840
imitation of life and
Nella Larsen's passing,

00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:19.910
and class and gender,
are often portrayed

00:10:19.910 --> 00:10:21.740
as leading a life
of tragic duplicity

00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:24.300
and as deceivers who
will be punished harshly

00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:31.799
by society when their true
identity is uncovered.

00:10:31.799 --> 00:10:33.340
This is no different
for trans people

00:10:33.340 --> 00:10:37.890
who pass as their gender, or
more accurately are assumed

00:10:37.890 --> 00:10:40.820
to be cis or blend
in as cis, as if that

00:10:40.820 --> 00:10:42.560
is the standard or the norm.

00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:45.010
This pervasive thinking
frames trans people

00:10:45.010 --> 00:10:47.200
as illegitimate and unnatural.

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:51.210
If a trans women who knows
herself operates in the world

00:10:51.210 --> 00:10:53.510
and is seen as a woman,
perceived, treated,

00:10:53.510 --> 00:10:56.370
and viewed as a woman, isn't
she just being herself?

00:10:56.370 --> 00:10:58.855
She isn't passing,
she's merely being."

00:10:58.855 --> 00:11:01.230
And I love that
piece of it because I

00:11:01.230 --> 00:11:05.630
think you're calling out the
ways that we make assumptions

00:11:05.630 --> 00:11:10.090
about gender as cis people,
and our expectations of what

00:11:10.090 --> 00:11:13.020
we imagine difference
and other to be.

00:11:13.020 --> 00:11:15.680
And so do you see more
people challenging

00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:18.630
this concept of passing, now
that you've talked about it?

00:11:18.630 --> 00:11:21.250
Now that people have
access to the book?

00:11:21.250 --> 00:11:22.069
-I hope so.

00:11:22.069 --> 00:11:23.610
I don't know if I've
seen that, but I

00:11:23.610 --> 00:11:25.818
don't think it's only cis
people who make assumptions

00:11:25.818 --> 00:11:29.977
around folks as gender and
pronouns and identities.

00:11:29.977 --> 00:11:31.310
I make assumptions all the time.

00:11:31.310 --> 00:11:36.850
I remember the other night there
was a non-binary professor who

00:11:36.850 --> 00:11:39.500
was in this space at
another talk I was giving.

00:11:39.500 --> 00:11:44.460
And I just assumed because I
saw lipstick and curly hair,

00:11:44.460 --> 00:11:48.510
and kind of a non-conforming
experience of femininity

00:11:48.510 --> 00:11:50.930
that I was like oh, so
maybe I'll complementing her

00:11:50.930 --> 00:11:52.120
by saying she and her.

00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:53.540
And then I was like, wait.

00:11:53.540 --> 00:11:55.000
Are your pronouns she and her?

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:56.750
And then they said, no it's not.

00:11:56.750 --> 00:11:57.920
It's they, them, theirs.

00:11:57.920 --> 00:11:59.044
That's what I would prefer.

00:11:59.044 --> 00:12:01.260
And then I apologized
for making assumptions.

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:06.330
So even though I'm talking
about these topics, and the way

00:12:06.330 --> 00:12:08.570
that we need to break this
down and stop assuming,

00:12:08.570 --> 00:12:10.440
I still make assumptions
on a daily basis.

00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:12.880
And we all kind of do it.

00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:15.390
And so for me, the idea
of-- I hope that people

00:12:15.390 --> 00:12:16.470
are challenging that.

00:12:16.470 --> 00:12:19.040
And continuing to
interrogate, and maybe

00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:22.110
stop a bit of their
inclinations or instincts

00:12:22.110 --> 00:12:26.950
to just completely like
assume immediately.

00:12:26.950 --> 00:12:31.392
I never liked passing because it
always felt as if I am passing,

00:12:31.392 --> 00:12:32.600
then is someone else failing?

00:12:35.110 --> 00:12:40.590
And so I feel as
if I did nothing

00:12:40.590 --> 00:12:44.780
to have to present
the way that I do.

00:12:44.780 --> 00:12:49.270
To have the things that I have
that enable me access to quote,

00:12:49.270 --> 00:12:51.520
unquote "pass this test."

00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:54.560
And folks may not have that.

00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:59.053
And so the conditional privilege
of being able to blend in.

00:12:59.053 --> 00:13:01.400
I would prefer us not to
talk about passing too much.

00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:04.720
But I understand that it is
a privilege that I do have.

00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:08.970
The fact that not only do I
pass as a cis gender woman,

00:13:08.970 --> 00:13:12.040
but I am also fall into the
line of what we consider

00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:14.570
to be an attractive woman.

00:13:14.570 --> 00:13:16.070
Because we also
have to unpack that.

00:13:16.070 --> 00:13:17.060
Because some people
be like, well,

00:13:17.060 --> 00:13:19.185
the fact they you're pretty,
doesn't that help you?

00:13:19.185 --> 00:13:21.280
And it's like, well yeah,
pretty privilege is real

00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:23.196
and passing privilege
is real, but they're not

00:13:23.196 --> 00:13:25.350
one and the same.

00:13:25.350 --> 00:13:26.227
You can have both.

00:13:26.227 --> 00:13:27.060
They can stack them.

00:13:27.060 --> 00:13:32.640
You can be a trans person
that does not pass, does not

00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:34.800
blend in, but is gorgeous.

00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:37.330
Like LaVerne Cox would tell me
in conversation all the time.

00:13:37.330 --> 00:13:40.870
She's like, I know that
I'm a beautiful woman,

00:13:40.870 --> 00:13:43.120
but I don't pass.

00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:44.520
I don't blend in as cisgender.

00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:46.690
And so even all of
that stuff and trying

00:13:46.690 --> 00:13:49.421
to unpack those layers
of like all of that.

00:13:49.421 --> 00:13:51.670
But I don't want to completely
just throw out passing,

00:13:51.670 --> 00:13:56.140
because I also understand
that it's a part of systems.

00:13:56.140 --> 00:14:00.320
The way in which people make
often make assumptions about me

00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:02.840
based on the way that
I present, and how

00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:04.510
I'm passing all of these tests.

00:14:04.510 --> 00:14:07.150
And that it enables
me access into spaces

00:14:07.150 --> 00:14:10.660
to be seen and heard on the
levels that I'm seen and heard.

00:14:10.660 --> 00:14:14.410
-And I think that piece-- one of
the things that hasn't happened

00:14:14.410 --> 00:14:16.360
so much yet in the
conversation is

00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:19.020
looking at the intersections
of both the ways

00:14:19.020 --> 00:14:22.150
that gender and race
and class come together.

00:14:22.150 --> 00:14:23.940
So what I love about
your definition

00:14:23.940 --> 00:14:28.550
is that you also think about
class as a form of passing.

00:14:28.550 --> 00:14:31.530
You give the example
of Joe Millionaire

00:14:31.530 --> 00:14:34.710
and some of the shows
where people are also

00:14:34.710 --> 00:14:37.420
quote, unquote "passing" as
being in a different class

00:14:37.420 --> 00:14:38.540
category.

00:14:38.540 --> 00:14:41.450
And I wonder if you'd maybe
you want to talk about that.

00:14:41.450 --> 00:14:44.910
How does intersectionality
show up in your life?

00:14:44.910 --> 00:14:45.500
-Oh my god.

00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:48.750
How does it show up in my life?

00:14:48.750 --> 00:14:51.020
I think about even
the way that I speak.

00:14:51.020 --> 00:14:53.270
I think I may have talked
about it little bit in terms

00:14:53.270 --> 00:14:57.670
of in the book about this
idea of my mother telling me

00:14:57.670 --> 00:14:59.470
I couldn't speak
Hawaiian Pidgin The way

00:14:59.470 --> 00:15:02.910
in which all of my friends
and my older siblings,

00:15:02.910 --> 00:15:04.440
and my grandmother spoke.

00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:05.587
We were always around her.

00:15:05.587 --> 00:15:07.920
And my mom was like you're
not going to speak in Pidgin.

00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:09.820
You're going to
speak proper English.

00:15:09.820 --> 00:15:11.740
And so being able to
speak proper English when

00:15:11.740 --> 00:15:13.340
I went to the
mainland, most times

00:15:13.340 --> 00:15:15.200
I wasn't marked as
being from Hawaii

00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:18.300
or having something that
denoted-- because also pigeon

00:15:18.300 --> 00:15:19.751
denoted class too.

00:15:19.751 --> 00:15:21.250
The fact that I
didn't come-- like I

00:15:21.250 --> 00:15:24.010
could speak some of the
buzz terms in academia.

00:15:24.010 --> 00:15:26.360
I could speak some of the
buzz terms in feminism

00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:28.270
and transness, and
all of these things

00:15:28.270 --> 00:15:31.150
that then enabled me to
kind of be accepted as OK,

00:15:31.150 --> 00:15:32.912
so you're passing this test.

00:15:32.912 --> 00:15:34.370
So we all come from
the same space.

00:15:34.370 --> 00:15:36.328
Like no, but we don't
come from the same space.

00:15:36.328 --> 00:15:39.480
Like I come from the streets
of Oakland, and Dallas,

00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:40.000
and Hawaii.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.070
And I have all these
things, but I've shedded,

00:15:42.070 --> 00:15:43.986
I've learned to shed all
these things in order

00:15:43.986 --> 00:15:47.350
to then now fit into this
very class, monied space.

00:15:47.350 --> 00:15:49.880
Like for example, for you
from NYU or People Magazine,

00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:51.760
or whatever the
spaces that I go into.

00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:54.430
Or as a TV presenter,
or a TV host.

00:15:54.430 --> 00:15:58.230
I speak in a way that people
are comfortable hearing.

00:15:58.230 --> 00:16:01.010
And it doesn't necessarily
represent where all of I

00:16:01.010 --> 00:16:01.582
come from.

00:16:01.582 --> 00:16:03.290
-And do you; think
you shed those things?

00:16:03.290 --> 00:16:06.250
Or do you think that
you make decisions

00:16:06.250 --> 00:16:08.140
about when you deploy them?

00:16:08.140 --> 00:16:10.390
-I think because it was so
much a part of my survival,

00:16:10.390 --> 00:16:13.610
it's become part of just
the way that I present I am.

00:16:13.610 --> 00:16:15.860
But when I'm around
family, it's different.

00:16:15.860 --> 00:16:20.110
So in different spaces,
you show up oftentimes

00:16:20.110 --> 00:16:22.680
not as a different
person, but you present

00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:25.310
and you feel comfortable
enough to show that.

00:16:25.310 --> 00:16:28.810
So in intimate space, the
intimate space of family,

00:16:28.810 --> 00:16:30.260
I can speak Hawaiian
Pidgin, and I

00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:32.810
feel comfortable doing that
because no one will judge me.

00:16:32.810 --> 00:16:35.000
They understand that
that is an entry in.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:36.110
That is how we speak.

00:16:36.110 --> 00:16:38.240
That is for us.

00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:39.990
And that's what language is.

00:16:39.990 --> 00:16:42.850
-And that leads me
to another question

00:16:42.850 --> 00:16:44.360
that I was going to ask later.

00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:48.020
But it how do you
decide what language

00:16:48.020 --> 00:16:50.510
is appropriate for what spaces?

00:16:50.510 --> 00:16:52.220
As black people, we
talk a lot about code

00:16:52.220 --> 00:16:55.150
switching and making
decisions about what we say

00:16:55.150 --> 00:16:56.439
and when we don't say it.

00:16:56.439 --> 00:16:58.730
Do you think that there are
some gendered language that

00:16:58.730 --> 00:17:02.750
is specifically for communities
that shouldn't be shared,

00:17:02.750 --> 00:17:04.569
and shouldn't go further?

00:17:04.569 --> 00:17:09.180
Because I remember watching
a video where you're making

00:17:09.180 --> 00:17:10.690
a decision about the title.

00:17:10.690 --> 00:17:12.945
And that there was
maybe a moment where you

00:17:12.945 --> 00:17:14.520
were going to call it Go Fish.

00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:15.700
Is that right?

00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:16.420
-Fish Food.

00:17:16.420 --> 00:17:17.890
-Fish Food, yes.

00:17:17.890 --> 00:17:21.910
And so making a decision
not to use that term

00:17:21.910 --> 00:17:25.400
was that also about who
you wanted to have access

00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:26.920
to that language?

00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:28.900
-I think so.

00:17:28.900 --> 00:17:31.380
But going back to the
intersection, really quick.

00:17:31.380 --> 00:17:33.350
So even the idea passing.

00:17:33.350 --> 00:17:37.640
So yes, I can pass and blend
in as a cisgendered woman

00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:39.350
in the world.

00:17:39.350 --> 00:17:41.280
But also the layer
of race comes in.

00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:43.390
So I'm passing as--
and that offers

00:17:43.390 --> 00:17:47.270
me to pass-- to be able to
blend in as a cis woman.

00:17:47.270 --> 00:17:49.560
Enables me a level of
safety that other trans

00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:53.380
women who are not able to
blend in as easily as I do

00:17:53.380 --> 00:17:55.610
don't have.

00:17:55.610 --> 00:17:58.050
But then the next layer
of that is I'm also pass.

00:17:58.050 --> 00:18:00.580
And so that's a test
that I am passing there.

00:18:00.580 --> 00:18:03.510
I'm still perceived as a
then cisgender black woman.

00:18:03.510 --> 00:18:06.950
I don't know how safe cisgender
black women are in the world.

00:18:06.950 --> 00:18:09.540
And so these are things where
it's like a lot of people

00:18:09.540 --> 00:18:11.780
will-- even within
trans spaces--

00:18:11.780 --> 00:18:15.020
they'll be like oh, she's
pretty and she passes.

00:18:15.020 --> 00:18:17.140
So no wonder she's-- she OK.

00:18:17.140 --> 00:18:18.210
Like she's already hit.

00:18:18.210 --> 00:18:19.070
And it's like no.

00:18:19.070 --> 00:18:23.180
We cannot then separate my
transness from my blackness.

00:18:23.180 --> 00:18:25.350
Like that's all a
part of who I am.

00:18:25.350 --> 00:18:28.250
And just because you may have
an agenda of what you believe

00:18:28.250 --> 00:18:31.510
is the hierarchical
nature of quote unquote

00:18:31.510 --> 00:18:33.080
"oppression olympics"
doesn't mean

00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:36.530
that you can then negate
the fact that I am still

00:18:36.530 --> 00:18:39.640
a black trans
women in the world.

00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:42.680
So going back to the
talking about when

00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:44.262
I make-- I think
your question was

00:18:44.262 --> 00:18:45.470
when do I make the decisions?

00:18:45.470 --> 00:18:46.451
Or Fish Food.

00:18:46.451 --> 00:18:47.450
We'll just go with that.

00:18:47.450 --> 00:18:50.950
So my friend Wendy, and
who's a huge character

00:18:50.950 --> 00:18:53.500
in the book, and also just a
huge presence in my life, still

00:18:53.500 --> 00:18:57.260
to this day, you just
call your book Fish Food.

00:18:57.260 --> 00:19:00.630
And fish is equated
within I think

00:19:00.630 --> 00:19:06.620
trans circles, ballroom
circles, queer spaces,

00:19:06.620 --> 00:19:08.360
mostly trans girl spaces though.

00:19:08.360 --> 00:19:11.020
Like oh, she's
serving fish today.

00:19:11.020 --> 00:19:13.400
Meaning like catch of
the day, you're fresh,

00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:15.620
you're everything.

00:19:15.620 --> 00:19:17.980
And we've seen that go
outside of that space

00:19:17.980 --> 00:19:20.060
and be seen as something
completely different.

00:19:20.060 --> 00:19:22.040
So now it's seen
as misogynistic.

00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:26.630
It's seen as a judgment
of women's or people

00:19:26.630 --> 00:19:27.296
having vaginas.

00:19:27.296 --> 00:19:28.795
A judgment on
vaginas, which is then

00:19:28.795 --> 00:19:30.211
a judgment of
women, which is seen

00:19:30.211 --> 00:19:31.560
as sexist and misogynistic.

00:19:31.560 --> 00:19:36.440
And so for me, as I realize
that the danger of just having

00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:39.210
this term go out, because
this book exists in spaces

00:19:39.210 --> 00:19:42.540
I have no control
over, I no longer

00:19:42.540 --> 00:19:45.810
wanted that term, which came
from my own first hearing it

00:19:45.810 --> 00:19:46.970
at 13 years old.

00:19:46.970 --> 00:19:49.100
Like, ooh girl,
you're serving fish.

00:19:49.100 --> 00:19:50.790
I didn't want that
to then be a judgment

00:19:50.790 --> 00:19:53.370
call on all trans folks,
specifically all trans women,

00:19:53.370 --> 00:19:55.770
specifically all
trans women of color.

00:19:55.770 --> 00:19:57.337
What are those dynamics?

00:19:57.337 --> 00:19:59.670
And so I chose realness,
because I felt it was something

00:19:59.670 --> 00:20:01.360
that someone could
see and kind of maybe

00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:02.720
understand what it meant.

00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:04.770
And then maybe then get
some depth of knowledge,

00:20:04.770 --> 00:20:07.350
in terms of speaking about that.

00:20:07.350 --> 00:20:10.140
Or getting what the
book's themes are.

00:20:10.140 --> 00:20:11.980
-That's brilliant.

00:20:11.980 --> 00:20:16.320
One of the words that
came up a lot last night

00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:22.440
was, someone said that the words
of the comedian were perfect.

00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:25.600
And I think sometimes you really
have perfect language that gets

00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:28.310
us to the heart of the matter.

00:20:28.310 --> 00:20:30.470
-I feel like they're imperfect.

00:20:30.470 --> 00:20:33.460
Because even the idea of--
I remember when-- and that's

00:20:33.460 --> 00:20:38.530
the one of things that there's
certain groups of folk who

00:20:38.530 --> 00:20:42.770
are looking to find your
flaws, find your imperfections.

00:20:42.770 --> 00:20:45.162
And something that thinking
about fish food for example

00:20:45.162 --> 00:20:46.870
is one of those things
that's pulled out.

00:20:46.870 --> 00:20:48.661
Some people are like,
you're not a feminist

00:20:48.661 --> 00:20:51.070
because you use this word
fish to describe all women.

00:20:51.070 --> 00:20:52.430
No, this is a language.

00:20:52.430 --> 00:20:58.190
This is a term that came out
of a very specific community.

00:20:58.190 --> 00:21:01.670
It was more trans
women were trying

00:21:01.670 --> 00:21:04.870
to-- womanhood was our goal.

00:21:04.870 --> 00:21:06.940
To be able to pass
and blend, that

00:21:06.940 --> 00:21:09.340
was the goal at the time
when I was 12 years old.

00:21:09.340 --> 00:21:10.340
That was the holy grail.

00:21:10.340 --> 00:21:14.584
Was be able to be seen as the
woman I knew myself to be.

00:21:14.584 --> 00:21:17.000
And it had no idea-- most of
us had never been with women.

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:20.780
We wouldn't have known
what-- but like that

00:21:20.780 --> 00:21:23.500
has become one of those things
where it consistently comes up.

00:21:23.500 --> 00:21:25.340
Where it's like, well,
she calls women fish.

00:21:25.340 --> 00:21:27.760
And it's like, no, we were
calling ourselves fish.

00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:30.010
And we were not
seen as real women,

00:21:30.010 --> 00:21:31.810
and you don't see us
as real women anyway.

00:21:31.810 --> 00:21:35.742
So it was unreal women
calling each other a fish.

00:21:35.742 --> 00:21:36.950
Calling each other an animal.

00:21:36.950 --> 00:21:37.741
Plus, I'm a Pisces.

00:21:37.741 --> 00:21:38.597
So I am a fish.

00:21:41.220 --> 00:21:42.920
-Which I would love
to talk about more.

00:21:45.980 --> 00:21:51.790
But I do want to move on to
a bit of your pop culture

00:21:51.790 --> 00:21:53.180
side of yourself.

00:21:53.180 --> 00:21:57.350
So as a pop culture journalist
and longtime Beyonce fan,

00:21:57.350 --> 00:22:00.080
what are your thoughts
about the words and voices

00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:02.860
of Messy Mia and Big Freedia?

00:22:02.860 --> 00:22:05.330
And not their faces in
the video Formation?

00:22:05.330 --> 00:22:09.420
And so for those who don't
know, Messy Mia and Big Freedia

00:22:09.420 --> 00:22:12.940
are gender non-conforming
black people

00:22:12.940 --> 00:22:17.110
who have definitely a
presence in New Orleans,

00:22:17.110 --> 00:22:20.970
and have brought a lot
of the cultural tradition

00:22:20.970 --> 00:22:26.080
of black queer and trans
spaces to the mainstream.

00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:29.840
-I'm sad that their faces
and their images are not--

00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:31.780
I don't know of Messy
Mia is still with us?

00:22:31.780 --> 00:22:32.280
-Right.

00:22:32.280 --> 00:22:32.780
She's not.

00:22:32.780 --> 00:22:34.310
-Yeah.

00:22:34.310 --> 00:22:35.870
But Big Freedia is.

00:22:35.870 --> 00:22:37.960
She's a center of
her own reality show,

00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:40.480
that I believe is
past season 3 now.

00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:41.990
So this is someone
that I would have

00:22:41.990 --> 00:22:45.050
loved to see get information.

00:22:45.050 --> 00:22:47.390
To really have someone's--
not just their work in it,

00:22:47.390 --> 00:22:50.510
but then also to have your
work cited and to be seen,

00:22:50.510 --> 00:22:52.400
I think is powerful.

00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:56.600
It would have introduced
millions of people

00:22:56.600 --> 00:23:01.540
to her, to her presence, to
an uncomfortable presence.

00:23:01.540 --> 00:23:04.190
To really push the
boundaries of what

00:23:04.190 --> 00:23:06.980
we say in this specific space,
which I believe that Beyonce

00:23:06.980 --> 00:23:10.320
was doing with Formation,
was this unapologetic space

00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:10.890
of blackness.

00:23:10.890 --> 00:23:13.140
It would even
challenge black folk

00:23:13.140 --> 00:23:15.770
to say that this is
also a black person too.

00:23:15.770 --> 00:23:16.270
-Yes.

00:23:16.270 --> 00:23:16.730
-Right?

00:23:16.730 --> 00:23:17.110
-Yes.

00:23:17.110 --> 00:23:18.530
-Someone that we're
going to also protect.

00:23:18.530 --> 00:23:20.000
Someone that's also
being harassed,

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:23.090
not only by police
and systems, and all

00:23:23.090 --> 00:23:26.830
of points of oppression, but
also within her own people,

00:23:26.830 --> 00:23:28.370
within our own community.

00:23:28.370 --> 00:23:30.370
And so that would've been
something that I think

00:23:30.370 --> 00:23:32.530
would have trickled
down to some trans girls

00:23:32.530 --> 00:23:35.480
being able to feel as if they've
seen a part of themselves

00:23:35.480 --> 00:23:42.550
in this visual unapologetic
celebration of blackness.

00:23:42.550 --> 00:23:45.200
But on the other hand, I
do love that Beyonce made

00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:46.860
such a political statement.

00:23:46.860 --> 00:23:51.250
For me, I've known
Beyonce for 17 years

00:23:51.250 --> 00:23:56.610
now, through pop
culture and television.

00:23:56.610 --> 00:24:00.060
Specifically through TRL.

00:24:00.060 --> 00:24:02.990
And I was always surprised
that for some reason

00:24:02.990 --> 00:24:06.640
white people were watching
it, and they were just like,

00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:08.950
they were surprised that
she was black or something.

00:24:08.950 --> 00:24:12.120
It was like, did you not see
her in Tina Knowles' Originals,

00:24:12.120 --> 00:24:13.870
like when she was 15 years old.

00:24:13.870 --> 00:24:16.010
Did you do not see her with
a hot comb in her hand.

00:24:16.010 --> 00:24:18.190
Like did you do not
see the fact that she

00:24:18.190 --> 00:24:21.830
was in a black girl group?

00:24:21.830 --> 00:24:23.990
And what you kind of
realize after a while is

00:24:23.990 --> 00:24:27.720
that once someone becomes
famous and they are deemed

00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:31.610
as part of their famousness
is that they can then quote,

00:24:31.610 --> 00:24:34.510
unquote "transcend race."

00:24:34.510 --> 00:24:38.070
And so the power to
me about Formation,

00:24:38.070 --> 00:24:40.560
about her releasing
the video, about her

00:24:40.560 --> 00:24:45.550
[INAUDIBLE] using all of
America's number 1 watched

00:24:45.550 --> 00:24:48.600
show, televised event,
she was like, oh no,

00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:52.570
just so you guys remember,
my dad's from Alabama.

00:24:52.570 --> 00:24:54.270
My mother's from Louisiana.

00:24:54.270 --> 00:24:55.530
I'm a black girl.

00:24:55.530 --> 00:24:57.690
A southern black girl,
which is a particular type

00:24:57.690 --> 00:25:00.190
of blackness, which I know that
even you were talking about.

00:25:00.190 --> 00:25:03.300
Just her kind of being like
this is a southern blackness.

00:25:03.300 --> 00:25:05.800
Like even that is
complicated in its own thing.

00:25:05.800 --> 00:25:07.620
But even thinking
about folk who've

00:25:07.620 --> 00:25:12.050
then transcended blackness,
OJ, or someone like that.

00:25:12.050 --> 00:25:14.020
I obsessed with OJ,
because I didn't live it

00:25:14.020 --> 00:25:15.046
when it happened.

00:25:15.046 --> 00:25:17.420
So now that the ethics thing
is out, I'm like, oh my god.

00:25:17.420 --> 00:25:21.420
At night deep diving
into all of the evidence,

00:25:21.420 --> 00:25:23.010
trying to figure out-- I get it.

00:25:25.550 --> 00:25:29.750
That was a long tangent,
but-- yeah, let me stop.

00:25:29.750 --> 00:25:32.799
I don't know where
I'm going with that.

00:25:32.799 --> 00:25:34.590
-Well I do think that
that's an important--

00:25:34.590 --> 00:25:36.430
-Oh, well, even within
those spaces, right?

00:25:36.430 --> 00:25:37.890
Like respectable blackness.

00:25:37.890 --> 00:25:38.390
Right?

00:25:38.390 --> 00:25:39.890
Often times, southern
black does not

00:25:39.890 --> 00:25:41.410
seen as respectable blackness.

00:25:41.410 --> 00:25:42.040
-Absolutely.

00:25:42.040 --> 00:25:42.540
-Right.

00:25:42.540 --> 00:25:44.374
So thinking about those
layers of all that.

00:25:44.374 --> 00:25:46.040
So I can be like, I'm
just a black girl,

00:25:46.040 --> 00:25:47.530
but I'm a southern black girl.

00:25:47.530 --> 00:25:51.980
To root herself in that, and
then that women have always

00:25:51.980 --> 00:25:54.840
been-- black women have
always been in formation

00:25:54.840 --> 00:25:59.031
when it comes to fighting
for all of our people, right?

00:25:59.031 --> 00:25:59.530
-Yes.

00:25:59.530 --> 00:26:02.300
And those nuances
really come to the fore

00:26:02.300 --> 00:26:04.210
when do you look
at race and gender

00:26:04.210 --> 00:26:07.820
together, which is sometimes
people don't do and talk

00:26:07.820 --> 00:26:10.040
about gender in a vacuum.

00:26:10.040 --> 00:26:13.540
Which makes these
assumptions about what

00:26:13.540 --> 00:26:16.530
are the races at the gendered
people we're talking about.

00:26:16.530 --> 00:26:19.100
And related to that,
I wonder if you

00:26:19.100 --> 00:26:21.730
might say a bit about
the words that people

00:26:21.730 --> 00:26:25.850
say that perpetuate unsafe
environments for our folks.

00:26:25.850 --> 00:26:31.160
Specifically, for queer
and trans people of color.

00:26:31.160 --> 00:26:33.020
How do you see the
language that we

00:26:33.020 --> 00:26:40.080
use every day reframing
or making assumptions

00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:42.830
about who people are?

00:26:42.830 --> 00:26:47.390
-I think one of the, just
maybe centering queer and trans

00:26:47.390 --> 00:26:52.330
folk of color, just
the idea of LGBTQ.

00:26:52.330 --> 00:26:55.850
Just that as an acronym.

00:26:55.850 --> 00:26:57.420
Oftentimes there's
a certain portrait

00:26:57.420 --> 00:26:59.830
of what we consider to
be what LGBT is, right,

00:26:59.830 --> 00:27:01.080
when people hear that.

00:27:01.080 --> 00:27:02.970
It's become its own
brand of something,

00:27:02.970 --> 00:27:05.890
and the mainstreaming of that
has often time equated that

00:27:05.890 --> 00:27:09.020
to white cisgender gay men.

00:27:09.020 --> 00:27:11.830
And their needs, and what
their priorities are.

00:27:11.830 --> 00:27:17.710
It doesn't necessarily think
about the LGBTQ homeless youth,

00:27:17.710 --> 00:27:19.900
right, who are on the
streets, who have nothing.

00:27:19.900 --> 00:27:21.060
Who only have their bodies.

00:27:21.060 --> 00:27:22.490
Who are engaged in sex trade.

00:27:22.490 --> 00:27:23.660
Who are trying to survive.

00:27:23.660 --> 00:27:27.170
Who are dealing with nonprofit
industrial complex and all

00:27:27.170 --> 00:27:29.590
of these things.

00:27:29.590 --> 00:27:31.720
We're not talking
about them, right?

00:27:31.720 --> 00:27:33.880
And so for me, I
often think about just

00:27:33.880 --> 00:27:37.270
like the labeling of that
oftentimes is so reductive.

00:27:37.270 --> 00:27:40.446
I'm glad that it may bring the
whole diverse group of people

00:27:40.446 --> 00:27:42.070
together and make it
seem as if there's

00:27:42.070 --> 00:27:46.460
this one solid community and
this one singular movement.

00:27:46.460 --> 00:27:56.790
But I know this acronym to be a
lot more diverse and plentiful.

00:27:56.790 --> 00:28:00.740
It's pluralities are
not communicated often.

00:28:00.740 --> 00:28:04.310
The sense, even within T.

00:28:04.310 --> 00:28:07.470
I have said this so many times.

00:28:07.470 --> 00:28:13.950
I am not an advocate
or an activist

00:28:13.950 --> 00:28:16.390
for transgender people.

00:28:16.390 --> 00:28:19.580
Because I cannot, in this
single body with this single

00:28:19.580 --> 00:28:23.270
experience, advocate for
all transgender people,

00:28:23.270 --> 00:28:25.710
because I don't know all
transgender experiences.

00:28:25.710 --> 00:28:28.120
I am still learning, just
from my own assumption.

00:28:28.120 --> 00:28:31.660
The other night, of that
professor's gender identity

00:28:31.660 --> 00:28:33.410
and pronouns.

00:28:33.410 --> 00:28:37.660
Non-binary experiences are--
some are reflective of my own,

00:28:37.660 --> 00:28:38.550
but they're not.

00:28:38.550 --> 00:28:41.410
Because even me,
my own narrative

00:28:41.410 --> 00:28:44.070
is one that has
often been held up

00:28:44.070 --> 00:28:45.800
as a kind of
narrative we tell when

00:28:45.800 --> 00:28:49.020
it comes to transsexual bodies.

00:28:49.020 --> 00:28:51.240
Like this experience of
medically and socially

00:28:51.240 --> 00:28:54.330
transitioning from
one part of the binary

00:28:54.330 --> 00:28:56.340
to another part of the binary.

00:28:56.340 --> 00:28:58.680
But there's folk who don't
feel the need to do that.

00:28:58.680 --> 00:29:00.720
So I can speak for all
transgender people.

00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:04.080
And I've always centered
transwomen within my work,

00:29:04.080 --> 00:29:06.590
but because things are
taken out of my own control,

00:29:06.590 --> 00:29:09.170
and my words and my labels
are not even asked of me.

00:29:09.170 --> 00:29:12.690
Like when I do interviews,
I'm then the voice of.

00:29:12.690 --> 00:29:16.210
And we've seen how dangerous
it is for folk to be

00:29:16.210 --> 00:29:18.170
seen as the voice of community.

00:29:18.170 --> 00:29:20.760
I work alongside my communities.

00:29:20.760 --> 00:29:22.625
I speak alongside
my communities.

00:29:27.670 --> 00:29:28.730
-That was great.

00:29:28.730 --> 00:29:29.725
I'm a leave it there.

00:29:29.725 --> 00:29:30.600
I'm a leave it there.

00:29:30.600 --> 00:29:31.910
-But words and language, yeah.

00:29:31.910 --> 00:29:32.613
-Yeah.

00:29:32.613 --> 00:29:33.360
-Yeah.

00:29:33.360 --> 00:29:34.030
-Exactly.

00:29:34.030 --> 00:29:34.630
-No pronouns.

00:29:34.630 --> 00:29:36.200
I know your question
was about-- not

00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:38.870
pronouns but abuse and violent
language that is often used.

00:29:38.870 --> 00:29:39.370
-Right.

00:29:39.370 --> 00:29:41.050
Well, related to pronouns.

00:29:41.050 --> 00:29:42.770
One of the things
that's happening now

00:29:42.770 --> 00:29:45.480
is people are having
a conversation

00:29:45.480 --> 00:29:48.035
about the use of cis versus
the use of non trans.

00:29:50.580 --> 00:29:54.410
And that's happening both
within community and outside,

00:29:54.410 --> 00:29:57.225
making decisions about
which language is preferred.

00:29:57.225 --> 00:30:00.340
Do you have any
thoughts about what

00:30:00.340 --> 00:30:03.420
you would prefer people use?

00:30:03.420 --> 00:30:07.350
-I don't have-- my thing
is if we're consistently

00:30:07.350 --> 00:30:11.580
always labeling the thing
that is seen as not normal,

00:30:11.580 --> 00:30:14.910
or that deviates from the norm,
I find that to be an issue.

00:30:14.910 --> 00:30:15.410
-Yeah.

00:30:20.145 --> 00:30:22.610
-I was going to equate race,
but I'm not going to do that.

00:30:22.610 --> 00:30:25.180
I'm not doing that today.

00:30:25.180 --> 00:30:29.836
Thinking about the
sense of-- I forgot

00:30:29.836 --> 00:30:31.210
who I was speaking
to about this,

00:30:31.210 --> 00:30:34.660
but you don't have
to identify as cis.

00:30:34.660 --> 00:30:35.660
Do you know what I mean?

00:30:35.660 --> 00:30:38.076
Just like a transperson doesn't
have to identify as trans.

00:30:38.076 --> 00:30:41.570
I know many transwomen, once
they've transitioned and are

00:30:41.570 --> 00:30:43.820
just living their lives,
they don't identify as trans.

00:30:43.820 --> 00:30:45.416
They just identify as women.

00:30:45.416 --> 00:30:46.790
But it doesn't
take the fact away

00:30:46.790 --> 00:30:50.610
that a part of their
experience is trans.

00:30:50.610 --> 00:30:53.177
But that may not be the way
that they will then identify.

00:30:53.177 --> 00:30:54.760
So for cisgender
people it's like, you

00:30:54.760 --> 00:30:56.260
don't have to
identify as cisgender,

00:30:56.260 --> 00:30:59.900
but cisgender is how we
describe your experience, that

00:30:59.900 --> 00:31:01.800
is not a trans experience.

00:31:01.800 --> 00:31:02.490
-Mhm.

00:31:02.490 --> 00:31:03.020
-You know what I mean?

00:31:03.020 --> 00:31:03.520
-Yeah.

00:31:03.520 --> 00:31:05.125
-And so for me,
I always struggle

00:31:05.125 --> 00:31:07.000
with a sense of, oh,
this thing is different,

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:10.022
so let's label that, and
then this will be the normal.

00:31:10.022 --> 00:31:11.980
So this is the normal
here, and everything else

00:31:11.980 --> 00:31:14.580
will then be labeled.

00:31:14.580 --> 00:31:17.100
-That is definitely part
of the problem, for sure.

00:31:17.100 --> 00:31:18.500
-But then also
thinking about-- I

00:31:18.500 --> 00:31:21.600
remember my brother
read the book, my book,

00:31:21.600 --> 00:31:23.810
and he's talking about,
he was just like,

00:31:23.810 --> 00:31:26.964
well I am a cisgender
black, you know.

00:31:26.964 --> 00:31:28.630
And thinking about
also how language can

00:31:28.630 --> 00:31:31.820
shut a lot of people out, too.

00:31:31.820 --> 00:31:36.160
Even now, cis is not a
term that most people

00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:39.510
outside of academia or outside
of like queer and trans

00:31:39.510 --> 00:31:44.360
circles and social spaces
understand or know quite yet.

00:31:44.360 --> 00:31:45.030
-Right.

00:31:45.030 --> 00:31:47.439
-And so if I'm having
a conversation--

00:31:47.439 --> 00:31:49.230
if my grandmother was
still alive and said,

00:31:49.230 --> 00:31:51.590
you're cisgender.

00:31:51.590 --> 00:31:55.130
My grandmother's bold
and she's up front,

00:31:55.130 --> 00:31:57.039
so she'd be like what is that?

00:31:57.039 --> 00:31:58.830
Some people will just
nod, and then they'll

00:31:58.830 --> 00:31:59.870
like shut off a conversation.

00:31:59.870 --> 00:32:01.470
They're probably
thinking in their mind,

00:32:01.470 --> 00:32:03.969
I don't know this word, so this
must mean something about me

00:32:03.969 --> 00:32:05.590
that I don't know this word.

00:32:05.590 --> 00:32:07.650
I think about that,
oftentimes, and so I

00:32:07.650 --> 00:32:11.010
think that's why
within my memoir,

00:32:11.010 --> 00:32:16.140
I went to work at explaining
words that a lot of folk--

00:32:16.140 --> 00:32:18.330
or, thinking about
my 12-year-old self,

00:32:18.330 --> 00:32:20.770
didn't even I didn't even
use the word transgender.

00:32:20.770 --> 00:32:25.090
I didn't know that
transgender was what I was.

00:32:25.090 --> 00:32:27.620
And so I always went back
to that, how would I then,

00:32:27.620 --> 00:32:30.030
if I'm writing this
book, not for the world

00:32:30.030 --> 00:32:32.830
but for that 12-year-old
transgirl who maybe doesn't

00:32:32.830 --> 00:32:34.010
even know what trans is yet.

00:32:34.010 --> 00:32:37.030
I need to then break
everything down for her.

00:32:37.030 --> 00:32:42.795
And not so much teach her about
how she should properly speak

00:32:42.795 --> 00:32:46.060
or the terms she should
know, but more of, this

00:32:46.060 --> 00:32:50.090
is the way that the world
is talking about you.

00:32:50.090 --> 00:32:53.740
-And speaking of your
12-year-old girl self.

00:32:53.740 --> 00:32:57.560
One of the things I really
love is your incredible piece,

00:32:57.560 --> 00:33:00.340
"The Free Girl Who Is
Everything" in The Feminist

00:33:00.340 --> 00:33:01.690
Utopia.

00:33:01.690 --> 00:33:05.680
And I have one more quote here.

00:33:05.680 --> 00:33:09.800
"In her world, the words
'girls' and 'women' do not need

00:33:09.800 --> 00:33:10.520
qualifiers.

00:33:10.520 --> 00:33:13.050
She will not furrow
her brow wondering

00:33:13.050 --> 00:33:14.900
if her interlocking
identities are

00:33:14.900 --> 00:33:16.770
ingrained in its definition.

00:33:16.770 --> 00:33:20.430
Because of her foremothers--
Sylvia, and Audre, Barbara,

00:33:20.430 --> 00:33:23.770
and Marsha-- she will no longer
be burdened by the question

00:33:23.770 --> 00:33:27.330
Sojourner Truth had to ask--
'Ain't I a woman?' When she

00:33:27.330 --> 00:33:31.200
hears 'girls' and 'women,'
Marissa Alexander, Gwen Araujo,

00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:37.990
Renisha McBride, CeCe McDonald',
Island Nettles, Zoraida Reyes,

00:33:37.990 --> 00:33:41.080
her sisters in Nigeria,
are all included.

00:33:41.080 --> 00:33:44.295
She will never doubt
their inclusion, or hers."

00:33:44.295 --> 00:33:47.472
And I thought that was
such a beautiful vision.

00:33:47.472 --> 00:33:49.960
And I'm wondering,
how do we get there?

00:33:49.960 --> 00:33:51.910
What are the things
that need to shift

00:33:51.910 --> 00:33:55.090
to help us create the
world for this girl,

00:33:55.090 --> 00:33:59.940
and the world for
your 12-year-old self?

00:33:59.940 --> 00:34:01.290
-I'm always challenged by that.

00:34:01.290 --> 00:34:03.180
I'm often invited
into spaces where

00:34:03.180 --> 00:34:07.850
it's like, we're gonna talk
about the status of women

00:34:07.850 --> 00:34:09.679
and girls.

00:34:09.679 --> 00:34:12.560
And I remember that piece
coming out of a part of a speech

00:34:12.560 --> 00:34:17.739
that I gave at the
foundation, where

00:34:17.739 --> 00:34:21.060
one of the
presidential candidates

00:34:21.060 --> 00:34:22.520
was giving the keynote.

00:34:22.520 --> 00:34:25.050
And it was all about
making a statement

00:34:25.050 --> 00:34:28.460
around the global status and
condition of women and girls.

00:34:28.460 --> 00:34:31.560
And I always feel as if
transwomen are rarely

00:34:31.560 --> 00:34:32.602
a part of that.

00:34:32.602 --> 00:34:34.310
Like, we're not talking
about transgirls,

00:34:34.310 --> 00:34:37.310
we're not talking about
a girl with a penis.

00:34:37.310 --> 00:34:41.270
We're not talking about a
girl that is in transition.

00:34:41.270 --> 00:34:43.860
We're not talking about a
girl that is-- so for me

00:34:43.860 --> 00:34:45.669
and my work, that's
who I center.

00:34:45.669 --> 00:34:47.210
And so I was like,
how do I bring her

00:34:47.210 --> 00:34:49.630
into this conversation,
but also link her,

00:34:49.630 --> 00:34:52.540
because I'm also a
black transwoman.

00:34:52.540 --> 00:34:55.679
I'm also a black transwoman
who engaged in the sex trade

00:34:55.679 --> 00:34:57.360
as a teenager to
take care of myself

00:34:57.360 --> 00:34:59.490
in a world that wasn't
taking care of me.

00:34:59.490 --> 00:35:03.400
How do I bring her as a
part of a lineage of women,

00:35:03.400 --> 00:35:06.270
as Kitchen Table: Women of Color
Press Barbara Smith would say,

00:35:06.270 --> 00:35:07.630
third world women.

00:35:07.630 --> 00:35:10.731
So how do I bring
her within that.

00:35:10.731 --> 00:35:12.730
Not so much to say that
transwomen are over here

00:35:12.730 --> 00:35:14.438
and all other women
are there, but to say

00:35:14.438 --> 00:35:17.240
that she's a part of, even
when we say girls and women,

00:35:17.240 --> 00:35:19.030
these girls and women
are not centered.

00:35:19.030 --> 00:35:20.863
These girls and women,
when they're missing,

00:35:20.863 --> 00:35:23.680
they're not on the covers
of People magazine.

00:35:23.680 --> 00:35:25.490
And so that's where
that space came from.

00:35:25.490 --> 00:35:26.410
How do we do that?

00:35:26.410 --> 00:35:30.760
I think it's
realizing that we have

00:35:30.760 --> 00:35:34.650
to take it beyond our
own, limited experiences

00:35:34.650 --> 00:35:42.580
and perceptions of what
is deemed my experience.

00:35:42.580 --> 00:35:45.810
Who goes away from that?

00:35:45.810 --> 00:35:48.660
Who doesn't quite fit
that experience for you?

00:35:48.660 --> 00:35:52.890
So if you're saying girls,
define what girls is to you.

00:35:52.890 --> 00:35:54.640
And then, how then do
we interrogate that,

00:35:54.640 --> 00:35:57.450
and then to challenge that
and then to open that up.

00:35:57.450 --> 00:36:01.650
And then how do we bring
the most oftentimes

00:36:01.650 --> 00:36:05.630
marginalized folk center.

00:36:05.630 --> 00:36:07.570
Like Bell Hooks said,
the margin's the center.

00:36:07.570 --> 00:36:09.860
How do we bring those
folk in, and then

00:36:09.860 --> 00:36:13.840
realize that by centering those
most marginalized, those often

00:36:13.840 --> 00:36:16.440
silenced and invisiblized
in many of our conversations

00:36:16.440 --> 00:36:18.910
and spaces and policies
and all those things.

00:36:18.910 --> 00:36:22.050
When we center them, we
then become more liberated.

00:36:22.050 --> 00:36:22.550
-Mhm.

00:36:25.390 --> 00:36:28.720
Deep breath on that, yeah.

00:36:28.720 --> 00:36:30.140
Yes.

00:36:30.140 --> 00:36:31.160
How do we do that?

00:36:31.160 --> 00:36:33.285
-How do you do-- no, that
what I wanted to ask you.

00:36:36.240 --> 00:36:37.390
-Well, I mean.

00:36:37.390 --> 00:36:39.500
I think language is
a big piece of that.

00:36:39.500 --> 00:36:41.920
Giving people access
to language that

00:36:41.920 --> 00:36:44.870
helps them see that there
are other possibilities

00:36:44.870 --> 00:36:45.820
is a big piece.

00:36:45.820 --> 00:36:48.890
So, again, going
back to your text,

00:36:48.890 --> 00:36:52.060
I think that the book
gives people access

00:36:52.060 --> 00:36:56.740
to language they wouldn't
have had access to before.

00:36:56.740 --> 00:36:59.090
I think that's one
place that it moves,

00:36:59.090 --> 00:37:01.295
and in popular
culture and media.

00:37:01.295 --> 00:37:02.670
That's another
place where people

00:37:02.670 --> 00:37:06.676
get the opportunity to
see a different reality,

00:37:06.676 --> 00:37:08.300
and I'm really
encouraged by the things

00:37:08.300 --> 00:37:10.609
that people are
creating for themselves.

00:37:10.609 --> 00:37:12.650
And that makes me think,
too, about your hashtag,

00:37:12.650 --> 00:37:13.670
#girlslikeus.

00:37:13.670 --> 00:37:16.560
Creating spaces
and using language

00:37:16.560 --> 00:37:20.120
to make space where
there isn't any.

00:37:20.120 --> 00:37:23.500
Do you want to talk about
the origins of #girlslikeus

00:37:23.500 --> 00:37:26.449
and how you've seen it shift?

00:37:26.449 --> 00:37:28.240
-I feel like I had some
random thought that

00:37:28.240 --> 00:37:31.590
came with it that was really,
really poignant, but I lost it.

00:37:31.590 --> 00:37:32.950
But going on to #girlslikeus.

00:37:35.460 --> 00:37:37.520
Twitter was a different
thing in 2012.

00:37:37.520 --> 00:37:40.320
I joined Twitter 2009.

00:37:40.320 --> 00:37:43.790
And I remember just
wanting to have

00:37:43.790 --> 00:37:46.480
a space where I could
talk about certain things,

00:37:46.480 --> 00:37:49.620
and folk not necessarily knowing
what I was talking about.

00:37:49.620 --> 00:37:52.880
But then folk that do
know what that spaces,

00:37:52.880 --> 00:37:54.000
they'll get it and know.

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:55.400
And then they can engage.

00:37:55.400 --> 00:37:59.990
And so it was just for me,
when I hashtag #girlslikeus.

00:37:59.990 --> 00:38:03.690
It was a space where
transgirls could come together

00:38:03.690 --> 00:38:06.250
and transwomen could
come together and talk

00:38:06.250 --> 00:38:10.940
about their issues, their
resources, share resources,

00:38:10.940 --> 00:38:14.570
share experiences, have a
sounding board, link up,

00:38:14.570 --> 00:38:17.030
and what I've seen is
that it's led to real life

00:38:17.030 --> 00:38:18.380
friendships for people.

00:38:18.380 --> 00:38:20.910
Even in my own space, because
I created that hashtag,

00:38:20.910 --> 00:38:22.456
I connected with people.

00:38:22.456 --> 00:38:23.830
I connected with
other transwomen

00:38:23.830 --> 00:38:25.810
who are now friends of mine.

00:38:25.810 --> 00:38:28.810
Deep, deep deep, friends who
I had never known before I

00:38:28.810 --> 00:38:30.080
created that hashtag.

00:38:30.080 --> 00:38:31.920
And I've seen that
happen for other folk,

00:38:31.920 --> 00:38:33.362
so it was like a connector.

00:38:33.362 --> 00:38:34.820
It's not something
that I even have

00:38:34.820 --> 00:38:36.640
to deal with-- I
don't even use it

00:38:36.640 --> 00:38:40.620
as often as I used to, because
now it has its own world.

00:38:40.620 --> 00:38:42.410
It's a part of other
people's lives.

00:38:42.410 --> 00:38:43.850
They put it in
their Twitter bios,

00:38:43.850 --> 00:38:46.850
instead of saying
blatantly, I'm a transwoman,

00:38:46.850 --> 00:38:48.880
they just say #girlslikeus.

00:38:48.880 --> 00:38:50.510
It's a wink and a nod.

00:38:50.510 --> 00:38:51.305
The girls know.

00:38:51.305 --> 00:38:52.180
You know what I mean?

00:38:52.180 --> 00:38:52.680
-Yeah.

00:38:52.680 --> 00:38:56.380
-It's like that's
what it's become.

00:38:56.380 --> 00:39:00.180
-I was really excited
to see it in Her Story.

00:39:00.180 --> 00:39:02.400
There's a moment where
the two characters

00:39:02.400 --> 00:39:03.950
talk about #girlslikeus.

00:39:03.950 --> 00:39:07.840
-And that's the
power of creating

00:39:07.840 --> 00:39:11.120
the stories and the
images and the words

00:39:11.120 --> 00:39:14.560
and the sounds that
represent who you are.

00:39:14.560 --> 00:39:18.000
Her Story is a project that was
created by Jen Richards, who

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:21.700
is a transwoman, and
starring Jen Richards,

00:39:21.700 --> 00:39:23.200
and my other friend
Angelica Ross.

00:39:23.200 --> 00:39:25.620
We met through #girlslikeus.

00:39:25.620 --> 00:39:26.770
That's how we met.

00:39:26.770 --> 00:39:31.240
I was going to a speaking
engagement in 2012 in Chicago.

00:39:31.240 --> 00:39:35.100
And I remember meeting them,
and I DM'd them through Twitter.

00:39:35.100 --> 00:39:37.190
And was just like,
let's get together.

00:39:37.190 --> 00:39:40.230
And so they became friends
because I linked them together.

00:39:40.230 --> 00:39:41.564
So it was a great connector.

00:39:41.564 --> 00:39:42.730
That's what #girlslikeus is.

00:39:42.730 --> 00:39:43.890
-You are a great connector.

00:39:43.890 --> 00:39:48.259
Because you also connected me
to a friend here in Boston.

00:39:48.259 --> 00:39:50.550
You're good at that, and
Twitter is a great space for--

00:39:50.550 --> 00:39:52.049
-I don't even like
people that much.

00:39:56.772 --> 00:39:58.230
I think because I
do media work, it

00:39:58.230 --> 00:40:00.670
seems like I'm so
outgoing and social.

00:40:00.670 --> 00:40:03.890
But it's more like I'd rather
be at home reading or binge

00:40:03.890 --> 00:40:06.000
watching something else.

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:06.500
-Ohh.

00:40:06.500 --> 00:40:08.310
What are you binge watching?

00:40:08.310 --> 00:40:10.600
-I told you, the OJ stuff.

00:40:10.600 --> 00:40:14.150
Because I didn't live
it the first time.

00:40:14.150 --> 00:40:18.040
It's just so layered,
there's so much stuff there.

00:40:18.040 --> 00:40:20.500
I didn't really have a
relationship to him, period,

00:40:20.500 --> 00:40:21.780
because I was too young.

00:40:21.780 --> 00:40:24.120
So when they were
like, OJ Simpson,

00:40:24.120 --> 00:40:27.650
even when I was watching
the OJ Simpson FX series,

00:40:27.650 --> 00:40:30.160
I was like, why was
he such a big deal.

00:40:30.160 --> 00:40:32.080
I didn't know that
having a Hertz commercial

00:40:32.080 --> 00:40:32.730
was a big deal.

00:40:36.500 --> 00:40:39.450
But seeing how he also
then didn't really

00:40:39.450 --> 00:40:41.830
have black folk in his life
beyond his family, right.

00:40:41.830 --> 00:40:44.119
Like he was one of those
folks that believed,

00:40:44.119 --> 00:40:45.660
one of those public
black people that

00:40:45.660 --> 00:40:48.380
believe that I can
transcend race,

00:40:48.380 --> 00:40:51.680
and I'm just-- the line in
the series is, I'm not black,

00:40:51.680 --> 00:40:52.740
I'm OJ.

00:40:52.740 --> 00:40:54.780
I was captivated by that.

00:40:54.780 --> 00:40:57.830
And so then I just wanted to
see in like what was going on,

00:40:57.830 --> 00:41:00.210
and the layers of the
domestic violence,

00:41:00.210 --> 00:41:02.674
and how they could
pick the jury.

00:41:02.674 --> 00:41:05.090
That black women were going
to side with their-- the thing

00:41:05.090 --> 00:41:06.270
that they always
do to black women

00:41:06.270 --> 00:41:08.970
is they're going to sign with
their gender, over their race,

00:41:08.970 --> 00:41:10.770
because he beat this woman.

00:41:10.770 --> 00:41:14.540
And then the next layer of folk
saying, well, Johnnie Cochran,

00:41:14.540 --> 00:41:18.440
he married a white woman, and
black women don't like that,

00:41:18.440 --> 00:41:20.970
when our successful black--
and so all of these layers.

00:41:20.970 --> 00:41:23.290
And then also, again, people
talking for black women

00:41:23.290 --> 00:41:25.404
would not necessarily
actually listening to what

00:41:25.404 --> 00:41:26.570
they would think about this.

00:41:26.570 --> 00:41:28.930
So anyway, all those layers.

00:41:28.930 --> 00:41:31.290
-And layers, layers
within layers,

00:41:31.290 --> 00:41:33.820
makes me think,
too, about what are

00:41:33.820 --> 00:41:36.770
the words-- what are the things
that you're excited about now?

00:41:36.770 --> 00:41:40.130
How do you see people using
words and find new ways?

00:41:40.130 --> 00:41:42.690
Is there anything
that's exciting you

00:41:42.690 --> 00:41:45.390
about the way that
language and words are

00:41:45.390 --> 00:41:47.740
moving in this moment?

00:41:47.740 --> 00:41:49.230
-Yeah.

00:41:49.230 --> 00:41:54.280
So what excites me, is the fact
that we all, now, have access.

00:41:54.280 --> 00:41:57.800
Our phones are like
extensions of ourselves,

00:41:57.800 --> 00:42:01.060
and they carry so
much stuff on them.

00:42:01.060 --> 00:42:03.090
And so the fact
that I'm constantly

00:42:03.090 --> 00:42:06.610
communicating with people
on Snapchat, on Twitter,

00:42:06.610 --> 00:42:07.400
on Tumblr.

00:42:07.400 --> 00:42:08.952
I can follow a Tumblr
tag and may not

00:42:08.952 --> 00:42:10.410
understand what
it's talking about,

00:42:10.410 --> 00:42:13.240
but will be taught that
day about someone else's

00:42:13.240 --> 00:42:15.390
experience.

00:42:15.390 --> 00:42:18.810
I feel like because we
have tools to create,

00:42:18.810 --> 00:42:21.190
we can now broadcast our lives.

00:42:21.190 --> 00:42:24.780
We don't need to wait for
a network or a producer

00:42:24.780 --> 00:42:28.610
to come and tell us, I want
to do a story on your life.

00:42:28.610 --> 00:42:31.430
No, I do a story of
my life every day.

00:42:31.430 --> 00:42:34.170
And so in that way,
I no longer have

00:42:34.170 --> 00:42:37.210
to look at mainstream media
to represent and reflect me.

00:42:37.210 --> 00:42:41.450
I can go to a hashtag and find
more people that reflect me.

00:42:41.450 --> 00:42:44.040
I can find my people.

00:42:44.040 --> 00:42:45.920
And then I can find
myself, and then I

00:42:45.920 --> 00:42:49.690
can be empowered because I found
my people and myself to then

00:42:49.690 --> 00:42:51.570
share myself with the world.

00:42:51.570 --> 00:42:54.412
And so then we get more
words, and more definitions,

00:42:54.412 --> 00:42:56.370
and some people may have
a different definition

00:42:56.370 --> 00:43:00.420
for certain word, or an
identity, or an acronym.

00:43:00.420 --> 00:43:01.970
Or a letter, whatever it is.

00:43:01.970 --> 00:43:04.270
And so we get closer
and closer to,

00:43:04.270 --> 00:43:07.590
I think, multi-layered
truths that

00:43:07.590 --> 00:43:11.170
will be in contradiction
and then in relationship to

00:43:11.170 --> 00:43:16.612
and-- I would even thinking
about-- I would say a year ago,

00:43:16.612 --> 00:43:18.570
or maybe when I even
wrote Redefining Realness,

00:43:18.570 --> 00:43:22.350
I saw the gender
binary as linear.

00:43:22.350 --> 00:43:25.830
And now I understand it
more as a kaleidoscope.

00:43:25.830 --> 00:43:28.110
It's all over the place.

00:43:28.110 --> 00:43:29.880
Male and female
no longer get to--

00:43:29.880 --> 00:43:31.713
or, men and women, or
masculine and feminine

00:43:31.713 --> 00:43:35.450
no longer get to be
these ends, bookends.

00:43:35.450 --> 00:43:36.490
They're no longer that.

00:43:36.490 --> 00:43:40.296
They're just a part of
this wider collection.

00:43:40.296 --> 00:43:41.670
And no one is
doing this anymore.

00:43:41.670 --> 00:43:43.405
No one's in the middle.

00:43:43.405 --> 00:43:44.280
You know what I mean?

00:43:44.280 --> 00:43:46.720
I'm over here, she's over
there, they are over here,

00:43:46.720 --> 00:43:48.122
zey is over there.

00:43:48.122 --> 00:43:50.330
That's what it is, and people
have to get comfortable

00:43:50.330 --> 00:43:53.120
with that, because as we
have these tools to broadcast

00:43:53.120 --> 00:43:55.660
our lives, there's
be more people,

00:43:55.660 --> 00:43:57.100
there'll be more voices.

00:43:57.100 --> 00:43:58.515
More definitions, more words.

00:44:02.420 --> 00:44:04.027
-But how do we get there?

00:44:04.027 --> 00:44:05.610
-What do you mean
how do we get there?

00:44:05.610 --> 00:44:07.360
-How do we get to the
place where people

00:44:07.360 --> 00:44:08.690
are more comfortable with that?

00:44:08.690 --> 00:44:10.615
Kaleidoscope

00:44:10.615 --> 00:44:11.990
-I think the number
one thing is,

00:44:11.990 --> 00:44:17.050
we are all really-- My
grandmother told me a long time

00:44:17.050 --> 00:44:19.700
ago, don't worry about what
people think about you,

00:44:19.700 --> 00:44:21.880
because there's just going
to think about themselves

00:44:21.880 --> 00:44:23.440
a couple seconds later.

00:44:23.440 --> 00:44:28.150
And so the fear
in that, the fact

00:44:28.150 --> 00:44:31.530
that like someone over there
identifies as such and such.

00:44:31.530 --> 00:44:34.480
The way that they identify
does not threaten the way

00:44:34.480 --> 00:44:35.500
that I identify.

00:44:35.500 --> 00:44:39.030
It takes nothing away
from me, the fact

00:44:39.030 --> 00:44:41.160
that this person
over there identifies

00:44:41.160 --> 00:44:46.780
as a non-binary
asexual crip dancer.

00:44:46.780 --> 00:44:48.310
That is who they are.

00:44:48.310 --> 00:44:50.120
-Right.

00:44:50.120 --> 00:44:51.870
-That has nothing to do with me.

00:44:51.870 --> 00:44:53.860
And I think that people are
uncomfortable, because they're

00:44:53.860 --> 00:44:55.068
trying to make it about them.

00:44:55.068 --> 00:44:56.790
All you have to do
is just understand

00:44:56.790 --> 00:44:58.350
that that's their identity.

00:44:58.350 --> 00:44:59.354
That's their pronouns.

00:44:59.354 --> 00:45:01.270
Them choosing their
pronouns doesn't take away

00:45:01.270 --> 00:45:02.240
your use of pronouns.

00:45:02.240 --> 00:45:04.260
Yes, you have to adapt
your language a bit

00:45:04.260 --> 00:45:07.200
when you speak with that person.

00:45:07.200 --> 00:45:09.950
But other than that, they're
moving on with their lives.

00:45:09.950 --> 00:45:11.594
It has nothing to do with you.

00:45:11.594 --> 00:45:13.010
It doesn't threaten
your identity.

00:45:13.010 --> 00:45:14.610
It doesn't threaten
your pronouns.

00:45:14.610 --> 00:45:17.860
It doesn't read your bathrooms

00:45:17.860 --> 00:45:20.686
-And that's the piece that
people keep coming up with,

00:45:20.686 --> 00:45:22.060
that feeling of
being threatened.

00:45:22.060 --> 00:45:25.760
I don't know if you've seen
The Prancing Elites, about--

00:45:25.760 --> 00:45:26.790
-Love them.

00:45:26.790 --> 00:45:27.640
-Love them.

00:45:27.640 --> 00:45:30.220
And I remember seeing
an episode in which--

00:45:30.220 --> 00:45:32.560
and for those who don't
know, Prancing Elites

00:45:32.560 --> 00:45:37.840
are a dance team, and they do
a style dance called J-setting.

00:45:37.840 --> 00:45:39.030
They're based in Alabama.

00:45:39.030 --> 00:45:42.030
And one of the
episodes I saw was

00:45:42.030 --> 00:45:43.910
a man who was
really uncomfortable

00:45:43.910 --> 00:45:45.020
with them dancing.

00:45:45.020 --> 00:45:53.070
And he said, I don't like men
wearing these kinds of clothes.

00:45:53.070 --> 00:45:54.510
-Then don't wear those clothes!

00:45:54.510 --> 00:45:55.120
That's my--

00:45:55.120 --> 00:45:55.980
-Exactly.

00:45:55.980 --> 00:45:57.050
But that was his thing.

00:45:57.050 --> 00:45:59.090
He was like, it makes
me uncomfortable.

00:45:59.090 --> 00:46:00.970
-Why?

00:46:00.970 --> 00:46:02.908
-I don't know.

00:46:02.908 --> 00:46:05.340
I don't know.

00:46:05.340 --> 00:46:08.230
I wonder, do you
want to say anything

00:46:08.230 --> 00:46:10.270
before we open it up to--

00:46:10.270 --> 00:46:11.230
-No.

00:46:11.230 --> 00:46:13.670
---questions?

00:46:13.670 --> 00:46:20.230
So if people have questions,
and want to come to the front.

00:46:20.230 --> 00:46:25.620
I would ask that people actually
ask questions, not comments,

00:46:25.620 --> 00:46:28.480
and we'll take a couple
of questions at a time.

00:46:28.480 --> 00:46:30.460
And then you can decide.

00:46:30.460 --> 00:46:32.490
We'll maybe take two or three.

00:46:32.490 --> 00:46:34.758
We'll hear the question,
and then you can-- yeah?

00:46:34.758 --> 00:46:35.508
-That sounds good.

00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:42.490
-One of the things I've
always loved about your work

00:46:42.490 --> 00:46:46.530
is that it's always seemed to
me as though, although you're

00:46:46.530 --> 00:46:48.680
talking about
transgender and you're

00:46:48.680 --> 00:46:52.560
talking about sexuality and
race, et cetera, in some ways

00:46:52.560 --> 00:46:56.490
it's really about people
accepting who they are,

00:46:56.490 --> 00:46:58.460
and accepting other people.

00:46:58.460 --> 00:47:00.550
Allowing other people,
and accepting other people

00:47:00.550 --> 00:47:02.940
being who they are.

00:47:02.940 --> 00:47:06.770
That whole thing about
being real that it's

00:47:06.770 --> 00:47:08.300
about accepting
people, and that's

00:47:08.300 --> 00:47:12.200
what's so thrilling about
it, is that the more

00:47:12.200 --> 00:47:15.750
we can have a
country and a world

00:47:15.750 --> 00:47:20.670
where people accept who they
are and accept other people.

00:47:20.670 --> 00:47:22.730
Beyond the issues
of sex, or race,

00:47:22.730 --> 00:47:25.200
or whatever else, religion.

00:47:25.200 --> 00:47:27.280
So I just wondered if
you've thought about it

00:47:27.280 --> 00:47:31.750
in those terms, as sort of the
broader issues of accepting

00:47:31.750 --> 00:47:35.790
other people, just for who
they are in any space and time

00:47:35.790 --> 00:47:38.300
and label.

00:47:38.300 --> 00:47:39.590
-Yeah, sure.

00:47:39.590 --> 00:47:41.275
Thank you-- you going to answer?

00:47:41.275 --> 00:47:43.530
-Well I was going to
let one more person go,

00:47:43.530 --> 00:47:44.722
or do you want to answer it?

00:47:44.722 --> 00:47:46.680
-I'm just going to answer
one by-- I'll forget.

00:47:46.680 --> 00:47:46.960
-OK.

00:47:46.960 --> 00:47:48.360
-Then I'm going to go
off on the OJ tangent.

00:47:48.360 --> 00:47:48.860
-OK.

00:47:52.167 --> 00:47:54.000
-So for me, I think
that the first time that

00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:57.524
was confronted with the idea
of how my work was being seen

00:47:57.524 --> 00:47:58.690
was after the book went out.

00:47:58.690 --> 00:48:01.080
But I remember when I
was being pre-interviewed

00:48:01.080 --> 00:48:05.230
for my interview
with Oprah Winfrey,

00:48:05.230 --> 00:48:08.180
they were talking about
all these universal themes

00:48:08.180 --> 00:48:08.720
of my book.

00:48:08.720 --> 00:48:10.207
Like about, everyone
has a struggle

00:48:10.207 --> 00:48:11.290
with accepting themselves.

00:48:11.290 --> 00:48:13.580
And I was like, yeah, I guess.

00:48:13.580 --> 00:48:15.910
But that's not the
way that I wrote it.

00:48:15.910 --> 00:48:19.780
And so I think that there
is universal themes that

00:48:19.780 --> 00:48:22.300
come out of someone just
sharing their truth.

00:48:22.300 --> 00:48:27.890
So I know in my own journey, it
was incredibly difficult for me

00:48:27.890 --> 00:48:33.460
to even it accept my own self.

00:48:33.460 --> 00:48:36.250
And then to share
that with, say,

00:48:36.250 --> 00:48:40.250
my siblings, my mother,
my father, my best

00:48:40.250 --> 00:48:44.660
friend, and then going
outside of that quote unquote

00:48:44.660 --> 00:48:48.170
"safe space" and going into
the world of school, community,

00:48:48.170 --> 00:48:54.210
volleyball team, college, and
thinking about how I wanted--

00:48:54.210 --> 00:48:58.650
I guess maybe one of unconscious
intentions of writing the book

00:48:58.650 --> 00:49:01.290
was to make folk
realize how hard

00:49:01.290 --> 00:49:03.160
it is to just accept
your own truth.

00:49:03.160 --> 00:49:04.110
And then to share it.

00:49:04.110 --> 00:49:07.530
And then also knowing that
oftentimes, sharing your truth

00:49:07.530 --> 00:49:10.860
can lead to exclusion
and violence and harm,

00:49:10.860 --> 00:49:12.300
and all of those things.

00:49:12.300 --> 00:49:14.620
And so hopefully
by breaking it down

00:49:14.620 --> 00:49:17.370
in the way that I did
with my own experience,

00:49:17.370 --> 00:49:19.410
it enables us all
to be a bit more

00:49:19.410 --> 00:49:22.670
open when someone comes to
us with their own revelation.

00:49:22.670 --> 00:49:25.460
Their own self revelation,
and feel safe enough

00:49:25.460 --> 00:49:27.290
to share it with them.

00:49:27.290 --> 00:49:30.635
And I hope that
that's what it does.

00:49:30.635 --> 00:49:32.260
So I'm glad that
that's how you saw it.

00:49:32.260 --> 00:49:33.466
Thank you.

00:49:33.466 --> 00:49:35.200
-And if you could
say your name, too.

00:49:38.740 --> 00:49:40.620
-My name's Emma
[? Kernan ?], I'm

00:49:40.620 --> 00:49:42.730
a first year at
Brandeis University.

00:49:42.730 --> 00:49:45.050
And I know you'll be at our
university in a few weeks,

00:49:45.050 --> 00:49:48.040
actually, so I'm
looking forward to that.

00:49:48.040 --> 00:49:50.500
As a first year, I've
had the opportunity

00:49:50.500 --> 00:49:52.110
to be doing an
internship with one

00:49:52.110 --> 00:49:54.780
of the scholars at the
Women's Research Center.

00:49:54.780 --> 00:49:58.830
And we're doing research
around the use of language,

00:49:58.830 --> 00:50:01.730
and the ways that you say it,
and the ways that you do it,

00:50:01.730 --> 00:50:05.140
and how it can affect
feminist activism.

00:50:05.140 --> 00:50:07.960
Janet Friedman is my scholar.

00:50:07.960 --> 00:50:09.930
And one of the
questions that I've

00:50:09.930 --> 00:50:11.750
been trying to do
research around,

00:50:11.750 --> 00:50:16.270
is how forms of language,
specifically the hashtag,

00:50:16.270 --> 00:50:20.440
how that can be used to
create a form of activism.

00:50:20.440 --> 00:50:22.980
And I know as an
activist yourself

00:50:22.980 --> 00:50:26.970
and an author and generally
very much involved in pop

00:50:26.970 --> 00:50:29.680
culture, how do
you yourself find

00:50:29.680 --> 00:50:32.460
the use of the hashtag
on Twitter and Tumblr

00:50:32.460 --> 00:50:36.120
useful for promoting activism.

00:50:36.120 --> 00:50:40.670
-I think it's a great
connector for information.

00:50:40.670 --> 00:50:44.080
I know that oftentimes, I'll go
to-- the first thing I wake up

00:50:44.080 --> 00:50:46.430
to is Twitter, and the
last thing I go to sleep to

00:50:46.430 --> 00:50:47.100
is Twitter.

00:50:47.100 --> 00:50:48.674
So I'm always in on
the conversation,

00:50:48.674 --> 00:50:50.590
but when I'm sleeping
for my eight to 10 hours

00:50:50.590 --> 00:50:53.320
that I need to look this way.

00:50:57.817 --> 00:50:59.400
I wake up, and
something has gone off.

00:50:59.400 --> 00:51:03.170
I remember the other night,
I woke up to #trapcovers.

00:51:03.170 --> 00:51:04.750
And I was like what
are trap covers?

00:51:04.750 --> 00:51:07.120
And then my entire life changed.

00:51:07.120 --> 00:51:10.389
I don't know if that's--

00:51:10.389 --> 00:51:11.330
-So great.

00:51:11.330 --> 00:51:15.830
-You have to watch the
Adele one, it's so good.

00:51:15.830 --> 00:51:17.790
-The "Bohemian Rhapsody,"
too, is really good.

00:51:17.790 --> 00:51:18.340
-Oh yes, yes.

00:51:21.900 --> 00:51:23.560
People may not see
that as activism,

00:51:23.560 --> 00:51:26.210
but I think that
people wrote pieces

00:51:26.210 --> 00:51:29.210
around this creation of
this particular hashtag,

00:51:29.210 --> 00:51:31.890
and talked about
the layers of that.

00:51:31.890 --> 00:51:34.350
Folk were going back to
Beyonce's "Formation,"

00:51:34.350 --> 00:51:37.120
white people were
singing acoustic versions

00:51:37.120 --> 00:51:39.700
of "Formation."

00:51:39.700 --> 00:51:41.740
And then black
people were like, OK,

00:51:41.740 --> 00:51:43.120
well then, what
we're going to do

00:51:43.120 --> 00:51:48.260
is sing trap covers of your
favorite classics and songs.

00:51:48.260 --> 00:51:49.860
And so it was this
great conversation

00:51:49.860 --> 00:51:53.570
that was being had in this
public space around race,

00:51:53.570 --> 00:51:56.010
around representation,
around what we believe

00:51:56.010 --> 00:52:00.090
what pop culture creations
are ours, or yours,

00:52:00.090 --> 00:52:02.810
or what are those lines.

00:52:02.810 --> 00:52:04.770
And I think about
something like #sayhername,

00:52:04.770 --> 00:52:07.186
which I know we didn't really
we didn't get to talk about.

00:52:07.186 --> 00:52:10.910
But #sayhername is
one hashtag that now,

00:52:10.910 --> 00:52:14.440
when a transwoman of
color is murdered,

00:52:14.440 --> 00:52:18.120
what often tends to happen is
that-- an activist named Cerno

00:52:18.120 --> 00:52:20.100
Biko, now hashtagged
it, because she's

00:52:20.100 --> 00:52:22.760
a part of the
#blacklivesmatter network.

00:52:22.760 --> 00:52:27.280
She then talks about the
lives of black transwomen,

00:52:27.280 --> 00:52:28.830
oftentimes, who
have been murdered.

00:52:28.830 --> 00:52:31.490
And she goes and does
activism with their families.

00:52:31.490 --> 00:52:33.270
So she'll go to the
funeral to make sure

00:52:33.270 --> 00:52:35.150
that they're not
so much trained,

00:52:35.150 --> 00:52:37.720
but to make sure that
they use her pronouns.

00:52:37.720 --> 00:52:41.026
And they don't dead name
her, and all of these layers

00:52:41.026 --> 00:52:42.650
that happen after
these women are dead.

00:52:42.650 --> 00:52:44.980
And so someone in the
community, through a hashtag,

00:52:44.980 --> 00:52:47.230
was then empowered
to go out and do work

00:52:47.230 --> 00:52:49.310
beyond just getting information.

00:52:49.310 --> 00:52:53.375
But then to also create
this system that's not eve

00:52:53.375 --> 00:52:56.440
funded yet, but this
system of resource and care

00:52:56.440 --> 00:53:02.979
to care for families of color
who have trans daughters, who

00:53:02.979 --> 00:53:05.020
don't even know how to
deal with the intersection

00:53:05.020 --> 00:53:07.880
yet, because oftentimes these
girls were alone in the world.

00:53:07.880 --> 00:53:09.720
They fled hostile homes.

00:53:09.720 --> 00:53:11.700
And so there's now
a black transwomen

00:53:11.700 --> 00:53:14.581
who goes and does that work,
because of that hashtag.

00:53:14.581 --> 00:53:15.581
Do you know what I mean?

00:53:19.971 --> 00:53:20.470
-Hi.

00:53:20.470 --> 00:53:22.100
My name's Eleanor
[? McGordy ?], I'm

00:53:22.100 --> 00:53:24.610
from McGill
University in Canada.

00:53:24.610 --> 00:53:28.140
I study counseling psychology,
and I'm doing several research

00:53:28.140 --> 00:53:30.370
projects on trans this year.

00:53:30.370 --> 00:53:33.800
One thing I'm recently looking
at is media representations

00:53:33.800 --> 00:53:38.660
and obviously social media is
a huge part of that nowadays.

00:53:38.660 --> 00:53:41.370
My question pulls on
the themes of passing

00:53:41.370 --> 00:53:46.460
versus failing, being an
advocate for trans verses

00:53:46.460 --> 00:53:52.955
particular subgroups of the
trans asterisks larger group.

00:53:58.260 --> 00:53:59.970
I came across a
YouTube video where

00:53:59.970 --> 00:54:02.480
it was a trans African
American woman,

00:54:02.480 --> 00:54:06.450
speaking about how she's now
deciding to detransition,

00:54:06.450 --> 00:54:10.890
and she felt that she had been
tricked by women, transwomen

00:54:10.890 --> 00:54:13.940
in the media and
transwomen celebrities

00:54:13.940 --> 00:54:18.110
who were appearing like
goddesses and who were passing,

00:54:18.110 --> 00:54:21.670
and who had more
positive experiences

00:54:21.670 --> 00:54:25.250
than this woman, who
felt really continuously

00:54:25.250 --> 00:54:28.300
rejected by society.

00:54:28.300 --> 00:54:32.950
Sold her body, and was still
not passing and still felt

00:54:32.950 --> 00:54:35.430
rejected, and
basically was saying

00:54:35.430 --> 00:54:38.070
that she had been tricked.

00:54:38.070 --> 00:54:40.240
So my question,
coming full circle,

00:54:40.240 --> 00:54:44.940
is as you said,
passing is a privilege,

00:54:44.940 --> 00:54:47.110
and being attractive and
beautiful is a privilege.

00:54:47.110 --> 00:54:50.320
And having a voice for
that is a privilege.

00:54:50.320 --> 00:54:54.050
For the people who don't have
that privilege, who don't pass

00:54:54.050 --> 00:55:00.440
or who face lots of hardships
in their lives, how can we,

00:55:00.440 --> 00:55:03.040
or how-- this is kind of an
impossible question, maybe,

00:55:03.040 --> 00:55:06.770
but how can they
advocate for themselves

00:55:06.770 --> 00:55:08.010
without that privilege?

00:55:08.010 --> 00:55:12.190
Or how can we shape
a society that you

00:55:12.190 --> 00:55:17.290
can have more of a frame
for less privileged people.

00:55:17.290 --> 00:55:20.550
Let's say people who don't
pass, to have their own voice

00:55:20.550 --> 00:55:23.140
and not just look to
people who are passing.

00:55:26.020 --> 00:55:29.410
-I think that's an incredibly
convoluted question.

00:55:29.410 --> 00:55:31.720
It's layered in so many ways.

00:55:31.720 --> 00:55:34.530
Just in the framing
of it is problematic.

00:55:34.530 --> 00:55:37.220
What it broadcasts to
this entire room, I think,

00:55:37.220 --> 00:55:39.790
is problematic, too.

00:55:39.790 --> 00:55:41.580
It's difficult for
me to then break

00:55:41.580 --> 00:55:44.300
all of the layers of that down.

00:55:44.300 --> 00:55:50.540
But I think that all women and
girls, not just transwomen,

00:55:50.540 --> 00:55:53.440
are faced with impossible
images in media.

00:55:53.440 --> 00:55:59.000
So let's not just say transwomen
are grappling with that.

00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:02.590
Who are harming themselves
because of what the media has

00:56:02.590 --> 00:56:04.750
created as the image.

00:56:04.750 --> 00:56:07.740
So transwomen are
not only grappling

00:56:07.740 --> 00:56:11.060
with the idea of wanting
to-- some transwomen,

00:56:11.060 --> 00:56:13.570
we also have to be clear,
because not all transwomen's

00:56:13.570 --> 00:56:15.480
goal is to pass.

00:56:15.480 --> 00:56:18.850
I think that we are cognizant
that the system privileges

00:56:18.850 --> 00:56:21.460
folks that do pass and blend in.

00:56:21.460 --> 00:56:24.860
But I don't think that's
a goal for all transwomen.

00:56:24.860 --> 00:56:32.129
I feel incredibly, deeply sad
that this woman felt that way,

00:56:32.129 --> 00:56:33.170
and that was her journey.

00:56:33.170 --> 00:56:34.169
But that is her journey.

00:56:34.169 --> 00:56:37.350
I don't quite know it.

00:56:37.350 --> 00:56:42.180
In terms of folk in media and
what the media representation

00:56:42.180 --> 00:56:45.390
is, I think it's deeply flawed.

00:56:45.390 --> 00:56:48.810
I don't believe, again, that
all transwomen who are in media

00:56:48.810 --> 00:56:50.030
pass.

00:56:50.030 --> 00:56:52.160
I think a lot of them
would say that they don't.

00:56:52.160 --> 00:56:56.010
I do believe that a lot to
do subscribe and are allowed

00:56:56.010 --> 00:56:59.470
into the room, because there's
a certain layer of what I would

00:56:59.470 --> 00:57:03.570
say is acceptable femininity.

00:57:03.570 --> 00:57:06.130
A femininity that
is often celebrated.

00:57:06.130 --> 00:57:07.570
You can think about size.

00:57:07.570 --> 00:57:13.210
You can think about the ways in
which grooming is a part of it.

00:57:13.210 --> 00:57:16.320
Now do I believe that these
women are doing this in order

00:57:16.320 --> 00:57:17.770
to cater to?

00:57:17.770 --> 00:57:20.609
That I don't believe
that is a part of that.

00:57:20.609 --> 00:57:22.650
I believe that they are
showing up as themselves,

00:57:22.650 --> 00:57:24.340
and they are groomed in
the way that they believe

00:57:24.340 --> 00:57:25.965
that they want to
present to the world,

00:57:25.965 --> 00:57:28.010
and that is then
privileged and allowed in.

00:57:31.740 --> 00:57:41.630
But in terms of how do
we create a world-- how

00:57:41.630 --> 00:57:44.480
do we create a world, where--
right now what we're grappling

00:57:44.480 --> 00:57:47.520
with in the movement, I
think, is daily access issues

00:57:47.520 --> 00:57:48.020
for folk.

00:57:50.830 --> 00:57:52.600
How are you resourced?

00:57:52.600 --> 00:57:58.150
And one of the great ironies to
me is that transwomen of color

00:57:58.150 --> 00:58:02.610
specifically embody many
different identities,

00:58:02.610 --> 00:58:04.360
but rarely does all
those identities

00:58:04.360 --> 00:58:06.580
and those communities
show up for them.

00:58:06.580 --> 00:58:09.950
So we have feminist movements
that are dealing with gender.

00:58:09.950 --> 00:58:14.180
We have LGBT movements which
are supposed to be tasked

00:58:14.180 --> 00:58:16.090
with dealing with trans issues.

00:58:16.090 --> 00:58:18.220
And we have racial justice
movements, oftentimes

00:58:18.220 --> 00:58:20.130
that are not centered
around bodies that

00:58:20.130 --> 00:58:23.610
are not cisgender black males.

00:58:23.610 --> 00:58:26.444
And so there's no
coalition work in between,

00:58:26.444 --> 00:58:27.860
because everyone
says, well that's

00:58:27.860 --> 00:58:31.210
LGBT work that's supposed to
do with these trans people.

00:58:31.210 --> 00:58:32.970
But in with the LGBT
stuff, oftentimes

00:58:32.970 --> 00:58:35.890
the dominant narrative is
white, gay cisgender men.

00:58:35.890 --> 00:58:40.370
So that's the great
tragedy, I believe,

00:58:40.370 --> 00:58:42.110
in the existence for
transwomen of color.

00:58:42.110 --> 00:58:46.780
And I think at this
particular woman,

00:58:46.780 --> 00:58:50.640
based on what the
soundbites I just heard,

00:58:50.640 --> 00:58:52.780
was dealing with a lot of
trauma every single day,

00:58:52.780 --> 00:58:55.620
daily access trauma to
even leave their home.

00:58:55.620 --> 00:58:58.180
And so I think people
don't even understand

00:58:58.180 --> 00:59:03.150
what it takes for
people who are grappling

00:59:03.150 --> 00:59:06.190
with living their truth
to just leave their home,

00:59:06.190 --> 00:59:07.270
if they have a home.

00:59:11.640 --> 00:59:15.024
And so, all of that stuff Yeah.

00:59:15.024 --> 00:59:15.524
-Thank you.

00:59:18.450 --> 00:59:19.890
-Hello, my name is Beckett.

00:59:19.890 --> 00:59:22.250
I am a sophomore at Harvard.

00:59:22.250 --> 00:59:25.340
And your definition
of realness sounds

00:59:25.340 --> 00:59:27.750
like it could be
incredibly empowering,

00:59:27.750 --> 00:59:32.540
and give you some strength
to help get through all

00:59:32.540 --> 00:59:38.660
of the daily
barriers that come up

00:59:38.660 --> 00:59:45.290
if you aren't a cis person,
if you want a white person.

00:59:45.290 --> 00:59:49.560
My question is, what if you
struggle with identifying

00:59:49.560 --> 00:59:53.060
who you are to yourself?

00:59:53.060 --> 00:59:55.060
Because if realness is
who you are to yourself,

00:59:55.060 --> 00:59:57.640
how can you be
real for yourself,

00:59:57.640 --> 01:00:01.250
if you aren't really
sure who you are?

01:00:01.250 --> 01:00:04.360
How do you address that?

01:00:04.360 --> 01:00:07.270
-I think that, for me, that
was one of the my earliest

01:00:07.270 --> 01:00:10.770
dissidences, was the idea
of the first things I

01:00:10.770 --> 01:00:15.120
learned from my parents was that
I was a black child in America.

01:00:15.120 --> 01:00:18.070
A poor black child in
America, grappling with that.

01:00:18.070 --> 01:00:22.430
And then the idea of, and you're
also a boy child in America.

01:00:22.430 --> 01:00:23.730
And this is who you are.

01:00:23.730 --> 01:00:26.710
So getting these definitions
and labels from parents,

01:00:26.710 --> 01:00:28.140
and then the work
for me came in.

01:00:28.140 --> 01:00:32.990
A lot of the confusion,
and heartache, and trauma,

01:00:32.990 --> 01:00:35.220
and policing that
I dealt with was

01:00:35.220 --> 01:00:38.440
trying to be in that
space of not knowing,

01:00:38.440 --> 01:00:39.720
and not being certain.

01:00:39.720 --> 01:00:41.969
I think one of the first
things I write about the book

01:00:41.969 --> 01:00:44.600
is around uncertainty
and embracing that.

01:00:44.600 --> 01:00:47.290
As a young person, it
was hard to do that.

01:00:47.290 --> 01:00:52.310
I can now, the person that
was 25 to 27 who wrote that,

01:00:52.310 --> 01:00:53.380
could understand that.

01:00:53.380 --> 01:00:58.220
But then for the four
to 12-year-old person,

01:00:58.220 --> 01:01:00.220
it was incredibly difficult.

01:01:00.220 --> 01:01:02.140
And I didn't have
the words then.

01:01:02.140 --> 01:01:04.010
I didn't have the
definitions then.

01:01:04.010 --> 01:01:07.430
And that's a part of the
self discovery process.

01:01:07.430 --> 01:01:10.200
And for me, it
happened quite young,

01:01:10.200 --> 01:01:12.680
that I was able to
face those things.

01:01:12.680 --> 01:01:14.700
And find the people
that I needed to find,

01:01:14.700 --> 01:01:17.280
and find my community
who helped me figure out

01:01:17.280 --> 01:01:18.550
what that was for me.

01:01:18.550 --> 01:01:21.620
What my identity
was, and who I was,

01:01:21.620 --> 01:01:23.820
and the resources that
I would need to find

01:01:23.820 --> 01:01:27.070
to be able to be who I am.

01:01:27.070 --> 01:01:29.630
And some people, it
happens later on,

01:01:29.630 --> 01:01:30.830
and it's a longer process.

01:01:30.830 --> 01:01:32.455
And there's things
that are in the way,

01:01:32.455 --> 01:01:35.780
and obligations that come
in, and family abuses,

01:01:35.780 --> 01:01:37.800
and all of those things.

01:01:37.800 --> 01:01:40.774
And so I think that that's just
part of self discovery process.

01:01:40.774 --> 01:01:41.722
-Thank you so much.

01:01:45.520 --> 01:01:46.090
-Hi, there.

01:01:46.090 --> 01:01:47.610
My name's John Kelly.

01:01:47.610 --> 01:01:50.160
I'm a first year grad student
in religion and trans theory

01:01:50.160 --> 01:01:52.100
here at Harvard.

01:01:52.100 --> 01:01:55.340
Something that I really
love is your friendship

01:01:55.340 --> 01:01:57.180
with Laverne Cox,
and the way you

01:01:57.180 --> 01:01:58.830
talk about your friend Wendy.

01:01:58.830 --> 01:02:00.288
And so I was
wondering if you could

01:02:00.288 --> 01:02:03.020
talk about what it means
to be a transperson,

01:02:03.020 --> 01:02:05.450
or just a human person
doing this work in relation

01:02:05.450 --> 01:02:09.440
to others, and the importance
of friendships and relationships

01:02:09.440 --> 01:02:15.100
in being able to sustain
the work and inspire you.

01:02:15.100 --> 01:02:19.670
-I don't think I'd be able to
do this work without my chosen

01:02:19.670 --> 01:02:22.730
community and chosen family.

01:02:22.730 --> 01:02:27.090
Wendy was someone I
met at 12-years-old,

01:02:27.090 --> 01:02:30.120
and I don't really know what
my life would be without her.

01:02:30.120 --> 01:02:36.690
So for me it's just an
integral part of my existence.

01:02:36.690 --> 01:02:39.300
I don't know what
it would be if--

01:02:39.300 --> 01:02:41.280
The thing I will say
about true community

01:02:41.280 --> 01:02:46.200
is that I can show up empty,
and nothing is expected of me.

01:02:46.200 --> 01:02:51.910
And I think that's the goal.

01:02:51.910 --> 01:02:56.930
I take and I grapple with a lot,
in places that are not my home.

01:02:56.930 --> 01:03:00.080
I'm taken out of my home and
brought to spaces like this

01:03:00.080 --> 01:03:02.570
to speak and talk and grapple
with questions from folks.

01:03:02.570 --> 01:03:07.070
I love being in
conversation with people.

01:03:07.070 --> 01:03:09.160
But it takes a toll.

01:03:09.160 --> 01:03:11.350
It's work.

01:03:11.350 --> 01:03:17.820
And I get to then
go home and text

01:03:17.820 --> 01:03:25.200
or call shadily Snapchat with
people that I love and care

01:03:25.200 --> 01:03:26.330
about, and check in.

01:03:26.330 --> 01:03:30.690
And so I think that because they
also do-- well, Wendy doesn't.

01:03:30.690 --> 01:03:35.170
Wendy's a makeup artist, and I
think she's in Paris right now,

01:03:35.170 --> 01:03:37.800
for Paris Fashion Week.

01:03:37.800 --> 01:03:40.015
Her Instagram so funny,
please go on her Instagram.

01:03:42.530 --> 01:03:44.680
I check in with Laverne
from time to time,

01:03:44.680 --> 01:03:48.020
and she has as
grueling of a schedule.

01:03:48.020 --> 01:03:51.330
And I think the difficult
part, what really bonds us

01:03:51.330 --> 01:03:57.530
and connect us is that idea of
being public, private people.

01:03:57.530 --> 01:04:02.360
And engaging with media,
and having stories,

01:04:02.360 --> 01:04:04.740
and words and things shaped
around and then people

01:04:04.740 --> 01:04:08.080
believing that that
is who you are.

01:04:08.080 --> 01:04:11.360
Or the facets of you
are shown in one place,

01:04:11.360 --> 01:04:14.010
but it's not really the
totality of who you are.

01:04:14.010 --> 01:04:16.490
And so for me, my
goal is oftentimes

01:04:16.490 --> 01:04:18.720
being able to show up
empty, and then also

01:04:18.720 --> 01:04:21.440
just show up fully as who I am.

01:04:25.120 --> 01:04:26.870
I think that we
can't do this work

01:04:26.870 --> 01:04:31.290
without having true community.

01:04:31.290 --> 01:04:34.220
-Thank you so much.

01:04:34.220 --> 01:04:38.160
-Hi, I'm Emma [? Stafaroni. ?]
I'm a high school teacher

01:04:38.160 --> 01:04:41.760
and also a compulsive
MSNBC watcher,

01:04:41.760 --> 01:04:44.000
although I feel that I've had--

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:44.500
-Still?

01:04:44.500 --> 01:04:45.041
-Still, yeah.

01:04:45.041 --> 01:04:46.490
So this is my question.

01:04:46.490 --> 01:04:48.290
I, like many of us in
the room, I'm sure,

01:04:48.290 --> 01:04:50.650
have had crisis of faith
with mainstream media,

01:04:50.650 --> 01:04:54.240
and I appreciated your points
about the way social media are

01:04:54.240 --> 01:04:55.924
disrupting that.

01:04:55.924 --> 01:04:58.090
But I would just love to
hear a little more from you

01:04:58.090 --> 01:05:00.510
about your relationship
to mainstream media, now

01:05:00.510 --> 01:05:05.160
that you have carved out this
space on MSNBC with So Popular,

01:05:05.160 --> 01:05:07.810
and, I feel like
created a space to be

01:05:07.810 --> 01:05:11.400
critical of the rest of
the media around you, even

01:05:11.400 --> 01:05:12.330
on that same channel.

01:05:12.330 --> 01:05:14.000
Especially in light
of recent news

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:17.530
this week, with Doctor
Melissa Harris-Perry.

01:05:17.530 --> 01:05:22.060
So I guess I'm interested in
hearing from you about that.

01:05:22.060 --> 01:05:24.070
-Well, what was so funny
is that I've always,

01:05:24.070 --> 01:05:28.120
my entire life--
I don't think I've

01:05:28.120 --> 01:05:31.440
ever worked in independent
media beyond social media,

01:05:31.440 --> 01:05:36.230
but even that's attached to
a whole other corporation.

01:05:36.230 --> 01:05:38.250
I'm thinking about
from when I was

01:05:38.250 --> 01:05:42.540
at People magazine, which is the
number one magazine in America.

01:05:42.540 --> 01:05:43.960
It's what people
read every week,

01:05:43.960 --> 01:05:47.600
and it has lives in nail
salons to doctor's offices.

01:05:47.600 --> 01:05:48.860
And just sits there, right.

01:05:58.370 --> 01:06:03.130
The difficult part is
being an employee within,

01:06:03.130 --> 01:06:06.570
and still having a
public voice to critique.

01:06:06.570 --> 01:06:10.610
That's a line that
specifically has been difficult

01:06:10.610 --> 01:06:16.060
this past week, in light of
Melissa Harris-Parry's show

01:06:16.060 --> 01:06:18.780
not existing anymore.

01:06:18.780 --> 01:06:24.523
I'm incredibly inspired
by her resistance.

01:06:26.897 --> 01:06:28.730
Her resistance to say,
this is not the space

01:06:28.730 --> 01:06:31.360
that I created
with my producers,

01:06:31.360 --> 01:06:34.310
and I no longer want to
engage in this space anymore,

01:06:34.310 --> 01:06:38.460
so I'm going to get
out of this contract.

01:06:38.460 --> 01:06:40.990
But she also has Wake
Forest to go back home to,

01:06:40.990 --> 01:06:44.470
so I think a lot of people
don't have that same,

01:06:44.470 --> 01:06:45.890
I have a whole other career.

01:06:45.890 --> 01:06:49.860
TV was fun for me to do,
but I'm done with that.

01:06:49.860 --> 01:06:52.370
For me, I don't think I
would ever be in a space

01:06:52.370 --> 01:06:58.480
where I feel as though I would
have to be silent about gaps

01:06:58.480 --> 01:07:00.330
that I notice.

01:07:00.330 --> 01:07:07.030
And I think that when I
created and pitched and hosted

01:07:07.030 --> 01:07:09.650
So Popular, but it
was always my space,

01:07:09.650 --> 01:07:12.560
and my space there
was to fill in gaps.

01:07:12.560 --> 01:07:17.920
I don't think that show is
prioritized at the network

01:07:17.920 --> 01:07:21.100
anymore, and I don't see
myself being at the network

01:07:21.100 --> 01:07:22.620
for much longer.

01:07:22.620 --> 01:07:24.465
-Thank you, appreciate it.

01:07:27.790 --> 01:07:29.610
-Hi, I'm Traci Abbott.

01:07:29.610 --> 01:07:32.740
I'm a professor of English
and Media Studies and Gender

01:07:32.740 --> 01:07:34.930
Studies program at
Bentley University.

01:07:38.880 --> 01:07:42.250
We've been talking about a
fixing prefixes to identities

01:07:42.250 --> 01:07:44.340
and communities, and
how you feel about it

01:07:44.340 --> 01:07:45.740
being a fix to movements?

01:07:45.740 --> 01:07:49.380
Because as someone who's
worked with genderqueer

01:07:49.380 --> 01:07:51.520
and transgender representations
for a long time,

01:07:51.520 --> 01:07:54.340
a recent collection came
out about transfeminisms

01:07:54.340 --> 01:07:55.380
by Anne Enke.

01:07:55.380 --> 01:07:57.880
And it was very helpful
for me, personally,

01:07:57.880 --> 01:07:59.830
because it bridged this
divide between queer

01:07:59.830 --> 01:08:02.660
studies and feminist studies.

01:08:02.660 --> 01:08:06.720
And it of course, engaged in the
conversations about feminisms.

01:08:06.720 --> 01:08:09.950
But at the same time, calling
it transfeminism somehow

01:08:09.950 --> 01:08:12.460
also makes it seem
distinct from feminism,

01:08:12.460 --> 01:08:15.700
which to me is about gender
equality for all genders,

01:08:15.700 --> 01:08:18.630
not just two genders or
people with a gender.

01:08:18.630 --> 01:08:21.130
So I'm curious about
how you see prefixes

01:08:21.130 --> 01:08:25.700
like that when they're fixed
to movements or disciplines

01:08:25.700 --> 01:08:28.420
as being useful,
because they're infusing

01:08:28.420 --> 01:08:31.359
a perspective into the
traditional definition that

01:08:31.359 --> 01:08:34.210
makes it broader, but at
the same time maintaining

01:08:34.210 --> 01:08:37.800
a binary between, say,
transfeminism and feminism,

01:08:37.800 --> 01:08:39.390
as if it's a false binary.

01:08:39.390 --> 01:08:41.700
Like they're not
on the same thing.

01:08:41.700 --> 01:08:43.200
-I think it [INAUDIBLE]
be important

01:08:43.200 --> 01:08:48.100
for us to be exacting in our
language about what our work

01:08:48.100 --> 01:08:49.550
is, and what it centers.

01:08:49.550 --> 01:08:51.250
So I would assume
in transfeminism,

01:08:51.250 --> 01:08:54.410
the work centers trans
folk within the fight

01:08:54.410 --> 01:08:58.090
for gender equity.

01:08:58.090 --> 01:09:02.850
I think that if we think about
the definition of who created

01:09:02.850 --> 01:09:06.550
and what feminism is, it often
didn't include women of color,

01:09:06.550 --> 01:09:08.560
for example, or poor women.

01:09:08.560 --> 01:09:11.370
And so it took a
lot of poor women,

01:09:11.370 --> 01:09:14.920
specifically I think about
black women, like Barbara Smith,

01:09:14.920 --> 01:09:17.899
to say, we're going to
have black feminism.

01:09:17.899 --> 01:09:21.540
And so I think that it's OK to
have those separate spaces that

01:09:21.540 --> 01:09:35.000
are part of this larger umbrella
of what the original term is.

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:36.439
I guess I'm not
bothered by people

01:09:36.439 --> 01:09:40.510
creating their own within.

01:09:40.510 --> 01:09:42.370
-Well, what I'm
hoping though, too,

01:09:42.370 --> 01:09:45.340
is that if it does undermine
the concept of say,

01:09:45.340 --> 01:09:47.540
feminism being only for
certain kinds of women.

01:09:47.540 --> 01:09:49.760
Certain kinds of privileged
women in particular.

01:09:49.760 --> 01:09:50.356
-But it does.

01:09:50.356 --> 01:09:51.439
A part of it does, though.

01:09:51.439 --> 01:09:51.850
-Right.

01:09:51.850 --> 01:09:52.683
-That's the reality.

01:09:52.683 --> 01:09:56.130
And so I think that it probably
was created in reaction

01:09:56.130 --> 01:09:58.710
to being in probably such
a space that was just

01:09:58.710 --> 01:10:02.710
seen as feminism, that didn't
want these people a part of it.

01:10:02.710 --> 01:10:05.980
And so the radical,
revolutionary, resistant thing

01:10:05.980 --> 01:10:09.000
is then to go and say that,
we are still a part of this,

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:10.945
and we'll still fight
for your liberation,

01:10:10.945 --> 01:10:13.010
but because you're
not fighting for ours,

01:10:13.010 --> 01:10:16.810
we need to create a space where
our liberation is centered.

01:10:16.810 --> 01:10:19.320
And so I think that that's
what it probably came from,

01:10:19.320 --> 01:10:24.640
because if feminism was
really for everybody, then

01:10:24.640 --> 01:10:27.300
we wouldn't have
these other spaces.

01:10:27.300 --> 01:10:29.520
-Thank you.

01:10:29.520 --> 01:10:32.680
-We'll take these
two more questions.

01:10:32.680 --> 01:10:33.260
-Together.

01:10:33.260 --> 01:10:34.590
-Together, yes.

01:10:34.590 --> 01:10:37.380
So ask your question, and
then we'll hear the last.

01:10:37.380 --> 01:10:38.260
-OK.

01:10:38.260 --> 01:10:40.760
-I think there's three there.

01:10:40.760 --> 01:10:41.291
-Just two.

01:10:41.291 --> 01:10:41.790
OK.

01:10:41.790 --> 01:10:43.550
-Oh, OK.

01:10:43.550 --> 01:10:44.650
-My name's Alicia Abbott.

01:10:44.650 --> 01:10:50.100
I'm an author and journalist
writing on LGBTQ issues.

01:10:50.100 --> 01:10:53.970
And I was just wanting to
return to the topic of violence

01:10:53.970 --> 01:10:57.060
against transpeople, especially
transwomen, especially

01:10:57.060 --> 01:10:59.950
transwomen of color,
often at the hands

01:10:59.950 --> 01:11:03.730
of straight identified, cismen.

01:11:03.730 --> 01:11:08.150
And I was wondering
if there need

01:11:08.150 --> 01:11:10.580
to be more visibility
and support

01:11:10.580 --> 01:11:12.427
for straight
identified cismen who

01:11:12.427 --> 01:11:14.010
are attracted to
transwomen, that they

01:11:14.010 --> 01:11:18.060
can be open about those
relationships, or so much.

01:11:18.060 --> 01:11:20.950
If there's stigma that
provokes violence because

01:11:20.950 --> 01:11:25.557
of rigid definitions of straight
male sexuality, what's at play?

01:11:25.557 --> 01:11:27.973
So I just was hoping you might
be able to comment on that.

01:11:32.060 --> 01:11:34.920
-My name's
[? Cabaseas. ?] I pass

01:11:34.920 --> 01:11:38.660
in a number of ways, some
actively, some passively.

01:11:38.660 --> 01:11:42.180
And hearing you talk about
passing with regard to race,

01:11:42.180 --> 01:11:47.530
class, and gender,
I felt compelled

01:11:47.530 --> 01:11:50.050
to make a link to assimilation.

01:11:50.050 --> 01:11:52.770
And I'm wondering if you can
talk at all to that link.

01:11:52.770 --> 01:11:54.270
Because I feel like
there are things

01:11:54.270 --> 01:11:57.110
are left behind in
both situations.

01:11:57.110 --> 01:12:00.697
So I wanted to hear
your thoughts on that.

01:12:00.697 --> 01:12:02.905
-I feel like I spoke a little
bit about assimilation,

01:12:02.905 --> 01:12:05.340
in the sense of talking
about shedding certain things

01:12:05.340 --> 01:12:07.120
from my own community.

01:12:07.120 --> 01:12:09.780
The way in which
speaking Hawaiian pidgin,

01:12:09.780 --> 01:12:14.190
or choosing to speak in a
certain way that presents

01:12:14.190 --> 01:12:18.410
in a better class space
in order to pull myself up

01:12:18.410 --> 01:12:22.322
in the bootstraps, as the
Republicans would say.

01:12:22.322 --> 01:12:26.900
So I feel like I've
touched on that.

01:12:26.900 --> 01:12:32.890
In terms of the men
whose date transwomen

01:12:32.890 --> 01:12:35.620
or have sex with transwomen,
I've written about this.

01:12:35.620 --> 01:12:37.940
And I struggle often
times, because folk

01:12:37.940 --> 01:12:39.690
are like, well
don't you think you

01:12:39.690 --> 01:12:44.530
should create space for these
men to gather, and talk.

01:12:44.530 --> 01:12:47.420
And I'm like, no, I don't
believe that I should create.

01:12:47.420 --> 01:12:51.480
I think that they need
to deal with their stuff.

01:12:51.480 --> 01:12:53.470
And I do know the
danger of also,

01:12:53.470 --> 01:12:57.031
yes, there needs
to be a space where

01:12:57.031 --> 01:13:00.760
men who date and have sex with
and/or fetishize transwomen

01:13:00.760 --> 01:13:05.030
can come together, and get
each other and deal with that

01:13:05.030 --> 01:13:06.140
and have conversations.

01:13:06.140 --> 01:13:09.390
I believe that recently there
was a protest at the Creating

01:13:09.390 --> 01:13:16.000
Change Conference in Chicago,
where young transwomen of color

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:21.800
shut down such a panel that
was created for these men.

01:13:21.800 --> 01:13:25.880
Because one of the men was an
alleged abuser of transwomen,

01:13:25.880 --> 01:13:28.540
and blah blah.

01:13:28.540 --> 01:13:31.190
All that stuff, domestic partner
violence, intimate partner

01:13:31.190 --> 01:13:32.780
violence, is real
and that oftentimes

01:13:32.780 --> 01:13:39.370
is a part of harm that
happened to transwomen.

01:13:39.370 --> 01:13:44.380
Also knowing that because
those men have not

01:13:44.380 --> 01:13:46.954
created the spaces
for themselves

01:13:46.954 --> 01:13:48.370
and probably don't
feel as if they

01:13:48.370 --> 01:13:50.640
need to create that
space for themselves,

01:13:50.640 --> 01:13:53.810
they are then taking
out that frustration

01:13:53.810 --> 01:13:56.310
that they're getting from being
policed by their masculinity

01:13:56.310 --> 01:13:58.460
and their sexuality
onto that woman

01:13:58.460 --> 01:14:00.620
that they are in a
relationship with.

01:14:00.620 --> 01:14:04.960
Who's already grappling
with her own stuff.

01:14:04.960 --> 01:14:07.340
And so I feel like
that's the cycle of that.

01:14:07.340 --> 01:14:10.050
So I do think that if there
is someone out there--

01:14:10.050 --> 01:14:13.240
I do think that that's
a vacuum or a space that

01:14:13.240 --> 01:14:14.550
needs to be filled.

01:14:14.550 --> 01:14:16.520
-But not by you.

01:14:16.520 --> 01:14:18.590
-It's just not work that
I'm committed to doing,

01:14:18.590 --> 01:14:20.160
but I understand
the need for it.

01:14:20.160 --> 01:14:20.660
-Yeah.

01:14:20.660 --> 01:14:22.076
I just wonder if
it's complicated,

01:14:22.076 --> 01:14:25.160
because you wouldn't want
to just name-- maybe they're

01:14:25.160 --> 01:14:27.530
dating a woman who doesn't
want to disclose her trans

01:14:27.530 --> 01:14:30.660
status, so in some
ways-- but I understand.

01:14:30.660 --> 01:14:32.150
-What do you mean by that?

01:14:32.150 --> 01:14:37.490
-Well I mean that there's
not a lot of visibility

01:14:37.490 --> 01:14:41.280
for straight, identified men
who are in relationships,

01:14:41.280 --> 01:14:44.599
and healthy relationships
with transwomen,

01:14:44.599 --> 01:14:46.640
and that they may experience
stigmas because they

01:14:46.640 --> 01:14:48.050
feel like they're the only one.

01:14:48.050 --> 01:14:52.050
And so for maybe someone
come out and say,

01:14:52.050 --> 01:14:54.260
I'm dating a transwoman,
I'm with a transwoman.

01:14:54.260 --> 01:14:58.280
That would be
disclosing-- disclose

01:14:58.280 --> 01:15:01.090
the status of their partner,
which would be violating

01:15:01.090 --> 01:15:02.520
that person's privacy.

01:15:02.520 --> 01:15:05.440
I'm just wondering about
the importance of visibility

01:15:05.440 --> 01:15:08.390
to reduce the
stigma that might be

01:15:08.390 --> 01:15:12.710
experienced by straight
identified trans amorous men.

01:15:15.270 --> 01:15:19.940
-So I feel like trans
amorous is one thing.

01:15:19.940 --> 01:15:23.440
My husband is such a man
that's-- but he's not a public

01:15:23.440 --> 01:15:23.940
person.

01:15:23.940 --> 01:15:27.022
But he is someone that
in the intimate part

01:15:27.022 --> 01:15:28.480
of our relationship,
has allowed me

01:15:28.480 --> 01:15:31.690
to write about our relationship
and our experiences.

01:15:31.690 --> 01:15:35.420
Allowed me to let a
magazine come and photograph

01:15:35.420 --> 01:15:38.360
our wedding.

01:15:38.360 --> 01:15:41.760
These images, I believe, exist.

01:15:41.760 --> 01:15:47.560
I do think that there
are other spaces, instead

01:15:47.560 --> 01:15:50.660
of having to be public to then
grapple with those issues.

01:15:50.660 --> 01:15:53.085
Whether that's with a social
worker or a therapist,

01:15:53.085 --> 01:15:55.210
that's a private space
where you're not necessarily

01:15:55.210 --> 01:16:00.310
disclosing your
partners transness.

01:16:00.310 --> 01:16:00.810
-OK.

01:16:00.810 --> 01:16:03.120
Thank you.

01:16:03.120 --> 01:16:05.990
-OK, well let's
thank Janet Mock.
