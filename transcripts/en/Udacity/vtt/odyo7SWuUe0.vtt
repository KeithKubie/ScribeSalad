00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:04.000
Remember that if we use the maximum distance between any two sample means,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.988
that's pretty much finding the range of all the sample means. And this doesn't

00:00:09.988 --> 00:00:14.050
give us a good measure of the variability of sample means. That's because we

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:17.472
could add a bunch of samples to this data set whose means are within this

00:00:17.472 --> 00:00:22.144
range. And the variabiltiy then wouldn't change if we use the range as that

00:00:22.144 --> 00:00:27.720
measure. We want to account for all samples. You also found before that the

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:34.179
average deviation adds to zero. So this can't work either. If we find the

00:00:34.179 --> 00:00:37.364
distance each sample mean is from each of the other sample means, then we might

00:00:37.364 --> 00:00:42.794
as well do a bunch of t tests. We'll have to do the same number of these

00:00:42.794 --> 00:00:47.525
calculations as t-test anyway. And t-test are a better measure of whether or

00:00:47.525 --> 00:00:53.360
not two samples are statistically different. We've reached our answer. Find the

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:58.890
average square deviation of each sample mean from the total mean. Since we're

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.537
only concerned with the variability between means. For now we're not concerned

00:01:03.537 --> 00:01:08.101
with the variablity between each sample. We're only looking at the mean of each

00:01:08.101 --> 00:01:13.071
sample. And rememeber, this is how you calculated the standard deviation. If we

00:01:13.071 --> 00:01:18.832
had a data set, and we find the mean. We found each squared deviation from the

00:01:18.832 --> 00:01:24.040
mean. And then in the case of a sample standard deviation, we divided by n

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:29.293
minus 1. That's exactly what we're going to do when we find the variabiltiy

00:01:29.293 --> 00:01:34.392
between means. The average square deviation of each value in each sample from

00:01:34.392 --> 00:01:38.880
the total mean also includes the error caused by individual differences between

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:45.112
subjects in each sample. And we don't want to include this error in our measure

00:01:45.112 --> 00:01:50.180
of between subjects variability. This is the total sum of squares. And we'll

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:54.412
reference back to this later. For now, we're only concerned with the square

00:01:54.412 --> 00:02:00.471
deviations of each sample mean from the total mean. The mean of all values from

00:02:00.471 --> 00:02:07.904
all samples. This total mean is called the grand mean in statistical terms. And

00:02:07.904 --> 00:02:11.429
we're going to denote this by x bar sub g.
