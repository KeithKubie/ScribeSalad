[MUSIC PLAYING]

ANDREW BROGDON: Since the launch
of Firebase as a unified app

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.250
platform, it's been
possible to use AdMob

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:12.970
as a part of Firebase.

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:15.000
But what does that
actually mean in practice?

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.750
Well, there's a few things.

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:20.130
First, you can use AdMob
with Firebase or on its own.

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:21.630
Either way is cool.

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.630
Second, the only big
difference for the way you code

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.640
is how your app gets set up.

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.550
Firebase has a config file,
which the app needs to include,

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.580
and the dependencies
for CocoaPods and Gradle

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:33.000
are slightly different.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.420
But either way it's the same
SDK for AdMob that ends up

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.680
in your app, which means the iOS
and Android API you use to load

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.020
and show ads don't change.

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.240
Showing an interstitial,
loading a banner,

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:47.610
or getting a callback
from a worded video--

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:48.990
they're all the same.

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:51.240
It's really just a question
of registering your app

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:53.070
and setting up the
build [INAUDIBLE]..

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.200
So, how to choose
which way to go?

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.260
Well the benefit of using
AdMob on its own is simplicity.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.060
It's just one service.

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:03.624
The benefit of using Firebase
is, you get Firebase.

00:01:03.624 --> 00:01:05.040
First-class analytics
straight out

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.950
of the box that include your
AdMob revenue and ad events,

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.770
plus easy access to the
real-time database, crash

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.810
reporting, cloud
messaging, and all

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.269
that other Firebase-y goodness.

00:01:14.269 --> 00:01:15.810
Either way, though,
you'll still have

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.420
the same mobile ad SDK and the
same AdMob working for you.
