00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:05.280
For what value of c is x minus
3 a factor of the polynomial p

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:06.170
of x?

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:08.780
And they tell us that p of x is
negative x to the third power,

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:12.030
plus cx squared,
minus 4x, plus 3.

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.390
So I encourage you to
now pause this video

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:17.550
and try to figure
this out on your own.

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.400
So the remainder theorem
tells us that if x minus 3

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:26.550
is a factor of p of x.

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.870
Now that's another way
of saying that p of x

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:37.570
could be written as x minus
3, times something else.

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:49.660
This is true if and only
if p of 3 is equal to 0.

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:55.760
p of three-- I would write
p in that yellow color--

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:02.820
This is true if and only
if p of 3 is equal to 0.

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.370
And this makes complete sense.

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:07.670
Because if you put 3--
if you evaluate p of 3,

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:10.010
we're saying that x minus
3 is a factor of p of x.

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:12.400
That means that you could
write p of x like this.

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:15.120
So, if you could write p of x
like this, what would p of 3

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:15.762
be?

00:01:15.762 --> 00:01:17.220
You substitute a
3 right over here,

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.390
you're going to have 3
minus 3 for this expression.

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:23.260
That's just going to be
0 times something else.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:24.830
Anything times 0 is 0.

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:27.810
So this should make just
a lot of common sense.

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.590
So p of 3 needs
to be equal to 0.

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:33.040
So let's just evaluate p
of 3 and then figure out

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:37.470
what c needs to be in order
to make p of 3 equal to 0.

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:38.720
So let's write this down.

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:44.110
So p of-- I'll do the
three in green-- p of 3

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:48.920
is going to be equal
to negative 3--

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.810
wrote it all in one
color, actually--

00:01:51.810 --> 00:02:00.020
3 to the third power, plus c
times 3 squared, minus 4 times

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:01.961
3, plus 3.

00:02:01.961 --> 00:02:03.460
So what's this going
to be equal to?

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:08.370
This is going to be equal
to negative 27, plus 9

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:13.550
c, minus 12, plus 3.

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:14.790
So what does that equal to?

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:20.270
This is negative 12 plus 3 is
negative 9, plus negative 27

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:26.130
is negative 36 so this is
going to be 9 c minus 36.

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:28.860
And remember, we want p
of 3 to be equal to 0.

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:32.210
This is p of 3, so we want
this thing right over here

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:33.017
to be equal to 0.

00:02:33.017 --> 00:02:34.350
So I'm going to make this clear.

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:36.990
We have p of 3 is
equal to this, and we

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:39.360
want to set this
to be equal to 0.

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.550
So let's just solve this
equation right over here.

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:48.320
So you add 36 to both sides,
you get 9 c is equal to 36.

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:53.790
divide both sides by 9,
you get c is equal to 4.

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:59.040
So if c is equal to
4, if p of x were

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.940
to be equal to negative
x to the third,

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:09.730
plus 4x squared, minus
4x, plus 3, then x minus 3

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:13.220
is a factor of p of x.
