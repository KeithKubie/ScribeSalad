00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:16.250
So let's talk
about what life is.

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:21.030
Buckminster Fuller said
life is anti-entropic.

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:24.090
In the universe, you have the
second law of thermodynamics.

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.700
You have entropy everywhere.

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:29.750
Entropy is breaking everything
into its simpler constituents.

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:34.330
Entropy is the playing out of
process, breaking things down.

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:36.130
But then you have this
thing called life.

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:39.070
In this Goldilocks zone,
this phenomenon of life, life

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:39.770
emerges.

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:41.400
It self-organizes.

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:44.005
It's almost like life resides
in a part of the universe that

00:00:44.005 --> 00:00:46.380
is self-organizing
towards complexity.

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:49.350
Its complexity bootstraps
on its own complexity.

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.630
Single-celled organisms
emerge in the biochemistry

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:54.415
of a planet like the Earth.

00:00:54.415 --> 00:00:56.540
It lives in the Goldilocks zone.

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:58.650
These single-celled
organisms clump together

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:00.640
into multicellular organisms.

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.140
These multi-celled organisms
eventually become primates.

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.030
These primates then get
caught in self-awareness.

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:08.650
They start to self-perceive.

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:11.410
Then these primates start to
imagine future possibilities.

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:12.360
They start planning.

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.740
A mind emerges.

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.110
A feral minds turns into a
tool, as Kevin Kelly says.

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:19.440
They can then think with
purpose and deliberation.

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:23.070
Then we spill over the creations
of our minds into the tools.

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.640
And then we engage in feedback
loops with those tools

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.900
to further extend our
creative possibilities.

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:30.300
It's fascinating
because it seems

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:35.040
there's a process of sort of a
self-organization of emergence

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:35.995
that's happening here.

00:01:35.995 --> 00:01:37.786
It's like these things
are coming together,

00:01:37.786 --> 00:01:40.100
and they're creating
transcendent effects.

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.440
They're exhibiting
transcendent effects.

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:44.510
Minds, brains--
these things seem

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:46.325
to be greater than the
sum of their parts.

00:01:46.325 --> 00:01:49.830
It's when you have higher
level order from lower level

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:52.290
organization, this emergence.

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.530
When birds enter swarms,
there's no leader,

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.330
there's nobody telling
all the other birds

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:58.704
how to get into
these formations.

00:01:58.704 --> 00:02:00.680
But it seems to be
self-organizing.

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:02.650
And we know that we
are made of atoms.

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:05.120
Those atoms clump
together into cells.

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:07.290
The cells clump
together into organs.

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.220
Those organs are clumped
together into us.

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:11.500
And we create tools, and
we wire each other mind

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:12.670
to mind communication.

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:14.560
We create a gaia global brain.

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.580
There's a global
brain itself, part

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:20.410
of the biological global grid,
nervous system of nature.

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.490
And those two things
breathing, thinking,

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:24.410
the think stratum
of the universe.

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:26.980
The universe wakes up.
