00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:12.480
There's a fascinating
organization

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.460
called MAPS,
Multi-disciplinary Association

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:16.890
for Psychedelic Studies.

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.910
This is a nonprofit
think tank that

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:22.560
advocates for the
responsible investigation

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.110
of psychedelic
plant and chemicals

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:29.140
and exploring their potential
as tools for transformation,

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:31.830
for interpersonal
transformation.

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.139
And this is a moment
that we're living in now.

00:00:34.139 --> 00:00:36.180
Right, we're kind of living
through a psychedelic

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:37.770
renaissance where, all
of a sudden, people

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.150
are starting to
take these tools,

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:41.140
these cognitive
technologies, that

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:44.340
have been used for thousands of
years a little more seriously.

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.720
We're starting to take
out the magnifying glass

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:49.100
and stop being alarmist and
actually paying attention

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.480
and studying the potential
of these tools, right?

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:55.150
So there's a fascinating
article written by Timothy Leary

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:57.590
back in the '60s
called Programming

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:59.340
the Psychedelic Experience.

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.990
And the idea here was that
if you could successfully

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:07.130
pattern and sequence the input
signals that the subject would

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:10.060
receive when he was on
a psychedelic odyssey,

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.140
you could literally
assure functional output.

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.270
You could almost guarantee
a functional catharsis,

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:19.830
that there would be of value
to the psychedelic session.

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.280
And he described the
psychedelic experience

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.720
as a period of
increased reactivity

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.830
to stimuli, both from
within and from without.

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:33.700
so you are immediately
plunged into a dialogue

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:35.140
with your own subconscious.

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:36.530
Things start to erupt.

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:37.830
Things start to emerge.

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:40.606
New patterns start
to be perceived.

00:01:40.606 --> 00:01:43.010
And at the same time,
the world, becomes

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:46.280
like a Sensurround system,
the fidelity, the resolution

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.124
of the input
signals get boosted.

00:01:49.124 --> 00:01:51.494
So all of a sudden,
you are overwhelmed,

00:01:51.494 --> 00:01:55.141
almost eclipsed by
the signals coming in.

00:01:55.141 --> 00:01:57.009
You are like a mind in flight.

00:01:57.009 --> 00:01:58.877
You are in orbital position.

00:01:58.877 --> 00:02:01.400
You are seeing the big picture.

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.388
But if you don't
have navigation,

00:02:03.388 --> 00:02:05.873
if you don't pattern those
signals by carefully choosing

00:02:05.873 --> 00:02:07.861
beautiful music, by
carefully curating

00:02:07.861 --> 00:02:11.340
excellent ecstatic
poetry, reveries

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.322
that you can read
while you are tripping,

00:02:14.322 --> 00:02:16.807
controlling the environment,
hanging around people

00:02:16.807 --> 00:02:20.783
whose company induces
feelings of well-being,

00:02:20.783 --> 00:02:24.262
by patterning those signals,
you're authoring the song.

00:02:24.262 --> 00:02:26.745
The soul surfing that
you're actually doing.

00:02:26.745 --> 00:02:28.848
The people that engage
in these mystical states

00:02:28.848 --> 00:02:30.018
are known as psychonauts.

00:02:30.018 --> 00:02:32.860
They're literally soul
surfers investigating psyche

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:34.700
through first person experience.

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.586
And there's all kinds of
answers that we can find within.

00:02:37.586 --> 00:02:40.960
There's all kinds of
spaces that we can explore.

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:42.972
The new space is inner space.

00:02:42.972 --> 00:02:44.460
And it's fascinating.

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:46.444
We have to look deeper
into this mystery.

00:02:46.444 --> 00:02:49.420
We need to explore
these numinous realms,

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.900
the archetypal
realms from within.

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.380
We need to go Carl
Jung on our own brains

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:56.364
using a cocktail of
chemical technologies

00:02:56.364 --> 00:02:59.588
that will thrust the
bodymind into liminal spaces

00:02:59.588 --> 00:03:00.332
of exploration.

00:03:00.332 --> 00:03:02.808
We need to engineer
inception-like dream spaces

00:03:02.808 --> 00:03:03.308
to explore.

00:03:03.308 --> 00:03:06.284
And the technologies are not
all going to be external.

00:03:06.284 --> 00:03:08.300
Some of them are
going to be internal.

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:11.171
Computers are drugs but
drugs are computers.

00:03:11.171 --> 00:03:12.539
This is the essence.

00:03:12.539 --> 00:03:14.330
This is why we should
be open to this stuff

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:16.315
because it's
absolutely fascinating.
