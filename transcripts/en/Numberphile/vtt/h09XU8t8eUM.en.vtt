00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.260
Here's the game that we really want to talk about.

00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:09.020
This is a game that deserves some close study, spending some time on,

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:15.180
and you will, if you study closely be able to beat everyone you play unless they have invested enough time

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:20.380
to learn what you have learned. It is simply the very same game, but we play it on

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:21.980
three boards instead.

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:29.920
The rules here are that a player on his move, his or her move, can put an X on any of the boards.

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:32.660
You can choose whichever board you like.

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:38.180
As players put X's on the boards eventually one of the boards will get three in a row.

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:41.680
And then that board - but only that board - is declared dead at that point.

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:47.500
You can't make anymore moves then, on that particular board, but you play on, on the remaining two.

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:52.980
Again, on one of the two remaining boards, once three in a row is made, that board dies,

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:58.680
it is no longer available for play. And you are left with whatever configuration of Xs may be on the third board,

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:00.360
and you complete that board.

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:05.100
Then whoever makes three in a row on the final board loses the game.

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:09.600
Okay, this game is difficult to master.

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:11.860
But it can be mastered.

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:13.860
Starting from this position

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.860
you do want to move first

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:17.860
now in practice

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.860
if you learn how to play this game

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:27.700
you can even let your opponent move first because you usually know enough you'll see a mistake they'll make and you'll be able to overcome that.

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:34.940
But if you're playing someone who happens to be really good then you do want to make sure that you move first.

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:41.160
Then there's another strange twist to this game that on three boards it actually doesn't even matter

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:45.260
what move you make. All the first moves are winning.

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:49.240
You can move where ever you want and it's still a winning position for you.

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:53.420
So you can pretend to be very magnanimous and say,

00:01:53.420 --> 00:02:00.280
"Brady, absolutely, please just choose any cell. I will accept that as my move."

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:01.380
You don't say "winning move."

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.600
You say, "I will accept that as my move and then we can play the game.

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.800
So this is a nice trick you can play just when you're getting started.

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:13.800
Then in general you remember that on one board it was the first player who wanted to go

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:21.040
and on three boards it's also the first person. If you were to play this same game, I'm not recommending it, but if you were to play it on five you would also want to move first.

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.880
And on boards that if you have two, four, six boards you don't want to move first.

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:27.080
You want to move second.

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:31.540
Now, I have to be completely honest with you, in order to play well and to

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.720
be absolutely certain no one will ever beat you

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:42.200
you are going to have to know certain configurations of X patterns on the board and have them memorized.

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:47.200
And it's not just the pattern you need to memorize but you'll need to

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.200
memorize a particular

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.880
variable or symbol or fingerprint for each one.

00:02:52.880 --> 00:03:01.300
Then what you need to do is multiply those symbols together which are just sort of like algebra things that you learn about in school

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:05.440
and then reach a certain safe configuration value.

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:10.460
That's basically all there is to it. The rest of it is just memorization.

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:12.700
This is small so I need to put on my glasses.

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:16.480
It is daunting but it's not quite so daunting as it looks.

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:23.200
This is a list of all the ways you can put up to nine Xs on a tic-tac-toe board.

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:26.540
It turns out there are exactly one hundred and two such ways.

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:28.540
No one turn off the video, okay?

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:34.920
There are one hundred and two of these but there are a lot of them that are very easy to remember.

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:38.000
For example if you look at the ones at the bottom here,

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.260
you'll see there are ones here that are all given the number 1 or the identity.

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.300
We're going to be multiplying these things together so

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:48.920
the ones that already have completed rows of Xs, they're already dead boards.

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:51.200
And so those are like the identity.

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:56.220
When we're multiplying things together, if a board is already dead it doesn't matter so it's just the number one.

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:01.380
You don't need to memorize dead boards because you look at them and it already has an X through it, you don't have to remember those.

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:07.340
So the only ones you need to focus on are the ones where there's still play available.

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:10.220
And for each of those it's going to be a symbol.

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:16.460
And the symbol is just going to be like a single algebraic term, like it might be an 'a', it might be a 'b squared'

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:19.720
it might be a 'bc', it might be a 'd squared'

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:22.140
or so on. And that's all you have to remember.

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:27.300
Plus a couple things having to do with reducing words and simplifying them.

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:30.180
Let me just show you some typical fingerprints.

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:33.340
Okay, one of them is say, just an X in the corner.

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:36.240
That happens to be the identity or the number one.

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.240
It's a fingerprint which does nothing.

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:43.080
It's the same as a dead board. If there's only one thing in the corner you can ignore it.

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:47.920
Another dead board is the one where the X is here. This is also a one.

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:53.600
All right. We might be systematic here so what is the last one,  Brady? What would the last one be?

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:54.620
-An X in the middle.

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:56.620
It would be an X in the middle, exactly.

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:59.980
So if we have this one, that one is slightly different.

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:02.720
This I am going to call c squared.

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:07.500
There are certain positions that come up a lot more than others. When you look at the big table, you'll say,

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:08.760
"uh, I can't do this. This is too hard."

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:13.540
Well, no, it's not too hard. You just have to play more and just kind of get used to it.

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:17.840
Okay so let's take some typical ones that come up all the time.

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:19.840
One of them is this one.

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:21.840
This comes up a lot.

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:24.500
And this happens to be b squared.

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:25.840
Okay, that's a good one.

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:32.480
One of them is when you have two Xs on the corners, opposite corners like this, then 'a'.

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:34.480
That comes up a lot.

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:39.400
The one that has ones like this, and that one also happens to be an 'a'.

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:44.600
Okay so let's say you go to the trouble of learning all these fingerprints, how is that going to help you?

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:52.880
Well, let's see. Let's start a hypothetical game. Let's say that I've made this first move X.

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:55.300
I look at this position and I like it.

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:57.720
Why do I like it? Because

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:00.380
this happens to be a one.

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:02.620
This one happens to be a 'c'

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:04.820
and this one happens to be a 'c'.

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:07.500
and when I multiply these two together

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:10.200
in my head I get c squared.

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:14.260
And c squared happens to be one of the magical

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:21.020
polynomials, or just monomials that I want to leave in every position to make sure I win.

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:24.040
c squared. So we have to remember that I like c squared.

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:26.540
So what are the other ones? There's c squared,

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:28.920
there's also the little letter a

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:31.480
there's b squared, and there's b times c.

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:34.200
And that's it. Those are the four you need to remember.

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:40.520
Those four ones, if you make a move so that the fingerprints multiply to one of those possibilities

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:45.500
then there's no way for your opponent to regain control; you will still win the game.

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:48.660
So at each stage you are always trying to find a move

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:54.820
that equals an a, a 'bc', a 'b squared', or a 'c squared'.

00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:59.620
Well, let's say that our opponent decides, they are free to of course to move on any of these free boards,

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:03.660
but let's say that my opponent decides to move on the same one here and moves here.

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:07.800
Okay, what's a good reply here?

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:10.200
Well, there's actually quite a nice reply.

00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:13.600
Remember c squared was itself a good move

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:19.560
and if I kill this board by moving here then it's completely out of play and I'm only going to be left with these two.

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:21.900
So that's going to be a c squared too. Boom!

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:27.480
I do this.  I'm still under control and I've killed one board also so we're getting closer to winning also.

00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:32.200
When you're playing this game you tend to look first at the options that involve killing boards

00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:35.100
Right, it's better. Think of it like an samurai

00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:40.100
it's better to kill your opponent sooner rather than later because if you let them linger

00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:43.840
they may rise up and all of a sudden surprise you.

00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:48.820
I always look first, is there a good move that involves killing something that's already on the board.

00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:55.800
So now let's say my opponent plays to shall we say let's play here.

00:07:57.160 --> 00:08:03.060
Okay, so that one, if you remember, that's a one now so I cross out the c and I make this a one.

00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:08.780
Now we multiply these two together. It's no longer c squared, it is now multiplying to c.

00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:09.660
-That's bad.

00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:11.660
That is bad. That is not one of the -

00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:15.140
I mean it's good for me because I need

00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:20.480
if it were a c squared that would be bad because I'd have no winning move, right. Remember that's what I'm trying to do to someone else.

00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:25.400
But if it's a c, I know that there is a winning move, I just need to figure out what is the winning move.

00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:31.800
Another one that I've happened to memorize and it's a very simple one is just that

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:36.980
if you have two like this, one in the centre and one on the edge connected

00:08:36.980 --> 00:08:40.220
it can be on the diagonal or oriented however you like

00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:41.580
that's always a 'b'.

00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:43.980
K, so this is a 'b'.

00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:49.240
That's a 'b'.

00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:55.080
And of course all the reflections and rotations and so on, these are all 'b's.

00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:59.200
All right, so that's what I'm going to do here I'm going to change this

00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:02.700
away from a one. It's no longer a one. It's now a 'b'.

00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:05.760
And now it's b times c and that's one of the magic ones.

00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:10.980
So now I'm no longer at b, I'm at bc and I'm still happy. I'm still winning.

00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:16.200
If I left my opponent facing a losing position at bc, now let's say, "what do they do?"

00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:24.720
Well one thing they could do is, you know, I killed a board, maybe they're dumb enough to, you know, kill a board too. So let's say they kill this one.

00:09:25.060 --> 00:09:25.720
Boom!

00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:29.180
Okay, so now this is now, what? It's the identity, it's dead.

00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:36.540
So it's just the number one. Right, remember from algebra, multiply by one has no effect. So all the dead boards, they're always one.

00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:44.160
Now you've got a c. Well we've already talked about this, haven't we? What is the winning move when we have one board?

00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:51.460
Bryan, what is the winning move? The winning move is not to move on the edge, remember? It's to move in the middle. So we do this.

00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:55.480
Okay, so now we still have to win this.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:57.480
But we know how to do that too.

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:00.060
We just do the knight's move strategy.

00:10:00.620 --> 00:10:01.940
Okay, so my opponent

00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:04.260
my opponent might move here

00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:06.820
I move a knight's move away here

00:10:07.660 --> 00:10:10.680
now my opponent maybe they move here

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:13.200
I move a knight's move away there

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:15.620
and now my opponent

00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:17.100
is dead

00:10:17.180 --> 00:10:20.000
and I have won, demonstrating

00:10:20.980 --> 00:10:22.200
my mastery

00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:34.740
that I hope all the numberphile video people will also become my rivals although I don't look forward to it, of tic-tac-toe on three boards in misère play. So good luck to everybody.
