00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.379
My name is Lexi Ibañez and I’m a fourth-year political science major 

00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:05.270
with a minor in global studies. 

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:08.730
There’s a bunch of academic opportunities for us here at UCLA.

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:10.509
I remember one of the first classes I ever took at UCLA was called 

00:00:10.509 --> 00:00:12.329
Space Weather. 

00:00:12.329 --> 00:00:14.579
And I was like, “Wait, there’s weather in space?” 

00:00:14.579 --> 00:00:17.070
Stuff like this, there’s classes you’ve never even heard about. 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:18.670
There are big lecture classrooms, 

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:21.349
and small seminars. And that’s only the beginning. 

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:26.140
What makes UCLA so amazing is that these experiences and these opportunities are out there.

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:28.770
You’re centered in Los Angeles, and there’s a huge network here. 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:31.759
I mean as far as field trips are concerned, internships...

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:37.840
I was working as a research consultant for NASA, and I was so shocked - I was shocked! 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:41.189
There are internships and programs for studying abroad, too. 

00:00:41.189 --> 00:00:43.750
I ended up going to Hong Kong for a semester. 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:47.120
I took a Chinese characters class

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:48.959
—I learned like 300 Chinese characters. 

00:00:48.959 --> 00:00:52.680
Exploring different majors and minors is part of designing your future. 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.390
I actually ended up taking lots of different classes in different 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:58.090
fields, different majors, different departments. 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:59.520
And I ended up taking Fiat Lux.

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.000
A Fiat Lux is just a one-unit course that a professor teaches.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.520
I took one on European Socialism.

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:06.800
Images of the earth.

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:07.760
American Indian Studies.

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:12.180
It exposed me even in my first quarter to something I was interested in 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.030
and wanted to be a part of, with students with similar ideas. 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.100
Besides taking a Fiat Lux, you can take Freshman Clusters 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.570
and honors programs, designed specifically for first-year students. 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:24.500
The breadth of what I was able to learn that first year 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.040
helped me focus on what I wanted to do. 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:30.880
UCLA is a research university, first and foremost. 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:34.050
It’s one of the preeminent research facilities of its kind. 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:37.010
Most of its departments are in the top 10. 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:40.340
You’re getting the best education you could get anywhere, 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.480
and you’re getting instruction from professors who are experts in their field.

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:47.580
There are so many incredibly smart people here who think in all different types of ways. 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:52.120
People here are very, very motivated. Everyone wants to learn, 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:54.520
and everyone is motivated for whatever their passion is.

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.939
I remember one day realizing, “Wow, no other school has this. You can’t top this.”

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:02.030
I’m here, I’m a part of this. This is where I’m supposed to be.

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:07.539
This has been the best four years of my life, and I hope you’ll come to UCLA and experience it for yourself.
