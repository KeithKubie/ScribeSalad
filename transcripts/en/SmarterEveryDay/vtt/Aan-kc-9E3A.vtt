Hey it's me Destin welcome back to Smarter Every Day. So today I'm in California

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.030
and I have the great privilege of introducing the MAN...

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:12.060
Alan Sailer.
- Hello
- Alan Sailer is, if you don't know,

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:16.070
one of the best high speed photographers that currently does the art.

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:20.090
So I'm here in his garden, back behind his house, and we're going to

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:24.130
basically study explosions underwater with some firecrackers.

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.150
(Destin) You typically do it with the high speed photography method right?
- Yeah it's just a

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.160
instant of detonation and I'm really looking forward to seeing

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:36.180
uh... time.
- Yeah exactly it's not just one moment.

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:40.200
(Destin) This is a M320 Miro Phantom camera and

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:44.250
what do you hope to learn here?
(Alan) I just want to be impressed, so uh..

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:48.270
do it. 3..2..1..0 [bang]

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:52.320
Alright! [laughs]

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:56.360
- Pretty cool. Let's look at the video.

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:58.390
[music]

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:04.460
- Oh yeah
- Ripple.
- Yeah.

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:12.530
OK so we decided we wanted a lower exposure time and

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:16.540
also a higher frame rate so what we're gonna do is we're gonna change the lens.

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.560
3..2..1..0.. [bang]

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.570
[falling debris]
- about 20 feet...
- Yep.

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.670
Man the uh.. I wonder if that was from impact or

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:40.710
if the bottle itself...
- No it sucks in... There's cavitation appears on the top

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:44.720
if you looked at the photograph.
-Yeah? Alright let's just look at the video.

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.810
Alright. I have a scientific mystery that I need your help

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:04.840
figuring out. Let's first define what an explosion is. Right?

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.850
So basically it's a rapid formation of gas and you have it contained in some type

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:12.870
of mechanical device and it increases pressure. And that mechanical

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:16.890
restraining device will eventually fail and blow outwards, correct?

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:20.990
But here's the question. After each shot I would go find the bottle

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:25.040
on the ground and the bottle would be sucked in on the top instead of blown

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:29.080
out like you would think. This is counter intuitive and we have to figure out why.

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:33.130
My theory is that as the bottle blows up on the bottom it begins to shoot up

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.140
like a rocket, and when it does this it starts to wrinkle like

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:41.160
grandma legs if you can see it, as it pushes the rest of the bottle forward.

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:45.170
Now the cap has more mass than the side walls of the bottle, so my theory

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:49.170
was that the bottle was pushing the cap, but the cap

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:53.190
weighs too much and so the bottle is out-running the cap. Alan on the other hand

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:57.240
disagreed with me. My position is that after detonation there's nothing but high pressure in the bottle,

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:01.260
but Alan referenced me back to some of his photos from his Flickr stream.

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:05.270
He always sees bubbles after detonation. Always. What causes

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:09.320
bubbles to form in a liquid? Of course. Cavitation.

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:13.340
A phase diagram is a fancy chart that uses pressure and temperature to describe what state

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:17.370
the matter should be in. We're located about right here which is 23 degrees

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:21.410
celcius. Now there's only a couple of ways we can go from liquid

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:25.410
over to vapor. One is we can move along the right here and increase the temperature

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:29.450
I don't think we're heating the water up enough in order to do that, so I would conclude

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:33.460
that Alan is correct. I believe we are lowering the pressure enough that we go beyond

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:37.480
this vapor boundary and turn into vapor. And all we have to do to turn it back into

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:41.490
a liquid is repressurize. OK let's look at the cavitation. Immediately after

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:45.510
detonation we're seeing bubbles all over the bottle. That's interesting but

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:49.510
150 microseconds later on the next frame, all the bubbles seem to be confined in one area.

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:53.520
Basically the shock waves are bouncing off the sides of the cylindrical bottle on the inside

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:57.570
and they're bouncing back toward each other and then they're interfering with each other and creating a

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:01.610
low pressure spot. I think that's pretty cool because you can already see the cap

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:05.660
beginning to suck in. On the next frame you can see what I call the "Wrinkly Grandma Leg Effect."

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:09.670
Now I think it's pretty interesting that the bubble is collapsing from the left to the right,

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:13.720
which might mean that's a compression wave going towards the front of the bottle,

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:17.760
but what's confusing to me is the cap of the bottle is still being sucked in.

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:21.800
So I convinced Alan to do a self-portrait with me but what I didn't realize is this self-portrait would

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:25.820
reveal more information than any of the other videos. At the point of detonation

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:29.840
clearly we have high pressure in the bottle. Then you can see the lid suck in

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:33.860
and then.. check that out. The lid shoots off.

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:37.880
So that implies to me that you have low pressure, and then high pressure.

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:41.910
Once the fluid is blown out of the bottom of that bottle, it begins to pull

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:45.930
fluid out of the top of the bottle with it. So we have an oscillation in pressure

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:49.960
Where have we seen something like that before? Sometimes when I'm drinking with a straw

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:53.990
I like to put my finger over the end of the straw and bring the fluid up out of the cup.

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:58.000
And then I'll release my finger and watch what the liquid does.

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:02.030
It oscillates. That's pretty cool and I think that's caused by fluid momentum

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:06.070
or the inertia of the fluid itself. So this momentum effect of fluid

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:10.150
applies to what we're doing too. As the fluid is blown out of the bottom of that bottle

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:14.230
you can see that it starts to pull liquid out of the top of the bottle and collapse the

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:18.260
side walls of the bottle. That's pretty cool too. So seriously,

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:22.310
thanks for your time. It's way more fun to think this through with you. Anyway, if you want the high speed footage

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:26.370
feel free to download it. Draw me some pictures and show me what you think the shock waves are doing on the video.

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:30.400
This guy did it. I don't think he's exactly right but he took a good stab at it.

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:34.410
I'm Destin. You're getting Smarter Every Day. Have a good one.

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:38.420
2..1..0.. [bang] By the way, Alan Sailer

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:42.480
grows very good apricots. The Russians have developed a way to use cavitation

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:46.500
to create a bubble on the front of the torpedo. This is called super cavitation.

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:50.540
If you fly the torpedo in that bubble you have way less drag

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:52.590
and you can move that torpedo way fast.
