AKSHAY: So hi, everybody.

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:06.930
Welcome to this Tech Talk.

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.340
So I'm here-- actually,
my name is Akshay.

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:13.910
I'm a UI designer at
Google, and I'm really

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:16.390
happy to announce that Ben
Von Wong has come here today

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:18.080
to speak to us.

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:20.680
Sometime last year I
discovered the photography

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:22.240
of Ben Von Wong.

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:25.150
I read about him, I checked out
his amazing epic photography,

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:28.032
and watched his YouTube
videos to learn what I could.

00:00:28.032 --> 00:00:29.490
And then in December,
I thought I'd

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.990
contact Ben and get in touch
with him, never expecting

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:35.550
to actually hear a response.

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.230
But Ben responded in
about four minutes--

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:41.940
and I checked the email
just to make sure.

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.475
And this week actually he
came out to the [INAUDIBLE]--

00:00:44.475 --> 00:00:47.760
he lives in Montreal-- came
out here and spent some time

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.110
at SmugMug.

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.500
He's been doing various shoots.

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:53.430
He was kind enough to invite
me on one of them this weekend.

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.960
And I discovered that not only
is he an epic photographer,

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.140
but he's also an epic guy.

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.420
So without further ado,
here's Ben Von Wong.

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:02.630
Thanks.

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:07.330
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:08.997
BEN VON WONG: Good
afternoon, everybody.

00:01:08.997 --> 00:01:10.579
Thank you guys all
for taking time out

00:01:10.579 --> 00:01:11.870
of your busy day to be here.

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:13.960
Super excited.

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:15.730
I don't think I ever
planned on coming

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:18.740
to speak at Google this trip,
so for me it's pretty huge.

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:21.570
And Google to me is a
white page with text box,

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.360
so this is pretty awesome.

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.370
Out of curiosity, just to
get a feel for who's actually

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:28.384
listening to me here
today, how many of you

00:01:28.384 --> 00:01:30.910
guys are photographers?

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:33.080
OK, how many would
consider yourselves serious

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:34.900
photographers?

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:37.060
A little bit less,
but pretty good.

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:41.070
And who doesn't do
photography whatsoever?

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.800
OK, because everyone
has a phone, right?

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:44.133
So now you're all photographers.

00:01:44.133 --> 00:01:46.514
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:46.514 --> 00:01:47.170
All right.

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:48.650
No, really cool.

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:50.960
Yeah, the reason is, my talk
is more or less centered

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.170
on to photography, but
the idea behind the talk

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:54.340
is really about inspiration.

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:56.790
So my idea behind
the talk is just

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.795
to come out here and talk
about the journey on,

00:01:59.795 --> 00:02:01.670
I guess, how I've gotten
to where I am today,

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:05.604
and to share a couple stories
here and there along the way.

00:02:05.604 --> 00:02:07.520
The way I've kind of
laid things out over here

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.410
is just-- I have the
introduction on why

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:10.910
I do photography
in the first place.

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:16.270
So what does it mean to
me, why is it important,

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:19.000
why I decided to become a
photographer, if you will.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.460
I have a timeline where I talk
about the defining moments

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:23.100
in my career, and
how I built up,

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:26.790
basically, from buying my first
camera to ending up here today.

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.980
I deconstruct how these epic
photo shoots come together

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:32.400
by breaking down a couple
key elements on how I source

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.650
things, how I find people,
how I bring them together.

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:37.230
I go over failure
really quickly,

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:38.980
because I think that's
a subject, a topic,

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:41.765
that a lot of
people get stuck on.

00:02:41.765 --> 00:02:44.390
And then last but not least-- I
keep the most exciting for last

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:45.600
so that nobody
leaves in the middle

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.974
my presentation, which is a
Photoshop deconstruction that

00:02:47.974 --> 00:02:50.480
has some before and afters
that a lot of people like.

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.980
So along the way there are a
bunch of little question breaks

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:54.490
here and there, but if you
do want to interrupt me,

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:56.950
I'm super friendly and I
will answer your questions

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:58.220
as we go along.

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:59.280
Cool.

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:03.480
So today we're going to
start talking a little bit

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.220
about photography and
why it is something

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:08.972
that is really important to me.

00:03:08.972 --> 00:03:10.680
And the reason I want
to kind of bring up

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.330
that initial subject is
because I think that people,

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:15.830
along the way as
you do photography,

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:19.340
the more you do it, you kind
of forget why you picked it up

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:20.934
in the first place.

00:03:20.934 --> 00:03:23.100
People get a little bit
distracted with the business

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:26.860
side of things, about earning
money, they start shooting,

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:28.480
and then they get
bored along the way.

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:30.510
And for me, photography
is a whole bunch

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:34.850
of things that incidentally
are related, too,

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:39.540
but aren't entirely
what makes what it is.

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:41.200
So that sentence
doesn't make sense.

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:41.700
It's fine.

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:43.700
I'll move forward.

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:45.410
One of the reasons
why I like photography

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:48.940
is the ability to create
things that are epic.

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:52.010
I like to bring stories to life.

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:54.950
I think growing up as a kid,
I've always wanted-- you know,

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:56.450
I've always read
books-- fantasies--

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:58.650
and every kid wants to be
a knight in shining armor,

00:03:58.650 --> 00:03:59.850
riding a horse whatever.

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:01.750
And suddenly I'm
in the situation

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:03.990
where I'm able to take these
visions that I had a kid

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:04.948
and bring them to life.

00:04:04.948 --> 00:04:06.820
I'm able to find people,
connect with them,

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:09.389
and make something that really
shouldn't exist in reality

00:04:09.389 --> 00:04:11.430
and just kind of bring it
into the present, which

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:13.130
is really, really amazing.

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:16.110
A shoot like this comes
together completely randomly.

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:21.200
I was actually sitting-- I
was actually just on Facebook

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:24.130
going through my messages, and
some dude from a medieval store

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:25.490
hits me up and says,
hey, I've seen your work.

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:26.610
I'd love to work on
something together.

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:28.610
You should come by our
store and check it out.

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:29.630
I said, sure, why not.

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:32.010
Went in, played dress
up for a couple hours.

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:34.060
And before we knew
it, we just started

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:36.800
talking about the possibility
of doing something together.

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:38.750
He had these amazing costumes.

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:41.445
And they said, you know,
we have about a two week

00:04:41.445 --> 00:04:42.820
window where we
can do something.

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:45.734
We have all the stock in
from the new collection.

00:04:45.734 --> 00:04:47.400
Would you like to do
something together?

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:49.983
And I said, well, I'm going to
head off to Europe really soon.

00:04:49.983 --> 00:04:52.055
It didn't look that
feasible, but you know,

00:04:52.055 --> 00:04:53.930
it was too cool of a
project to pass through.

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:54.870
So we had two weeks.

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:56.811
And before I left
the store that day,

00:04:56.811 --> 00:04:58.310
we had already
locked on a location.

00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:59.990
It was this medieval village.

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:02.630
And all I had to do was find
people to wear suits of armor.

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:04.421
So I went on Facebook,
hit it up, and said,

00:05:04.421 --> 00:05:07.460
who wants to dress up as
medieval soldiers on a weekend?

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:08.960
And I ended up with
about 50 people.

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:10.750
And we ended up in this
really surreal situation

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:12.350
where we had these
guys just watching

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:15.360
these beautiful sketches
that I had made.

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:17.190
And this huge number
of people actually

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:20.230
ended up showing
up-- over 50 people

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:22.990
within the space of two weeks,
just to come and dress up

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:25.170
and have a great time.

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:27.032
You know, this was in Montreal.

00:05:27.032 --> 00:05:29.240
It was right at spring, so
we had this crazy weather.

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:33.480
We had everything from
hail to rain to sun.

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:34.570
It made no sense.

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:36.710
But even though this
was a product that

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:38.550
was purely creative,
there was no money,

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:41.120
there was nothing involved,
all these people still got out.

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:44.990
And I think it's because
you almost bring back

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:48.312
a certain sense of nostalgia
to people where they can relive

00:05:48.312 --> 00:05:50.270
something that they would
never have the chance

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:51.920
to live otherwise.

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:55.830
And this is really--
50 people in the middle

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:58.340
of this barn with fire,
with all these props,

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:01.360
and it's absolutely crazy.

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:03.010
Another reason why
I love photography

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:06.660
is the ability to create
things that are different.

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:09.240
This was a shot that
I did for a metal band

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:11.580
by the name of The Agonist,
and they reached out to me.

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:13.920
Once again, they only
had a two week deadline.

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:19.724
And they needed to come out
with shots where they just

00:06:19.724 --> 00:06:21.390
wanted anything that
would be different,

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:23.210
anything that would
stand out, anything

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:25.250
that would make them a little
bit different from the crowd.

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:27.374
Because the minute you type
"metal band" in Google,

00:06:27.374 --> 00:06:28.140
what do you find?

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:31.960
Well, you find this-- a group
of people with their arms

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:35.180
crossed against a solid black
background looking badass.

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:36.432
And you know, that's not fun.

00:06:36.432 --> 00:06:37.640
Everyone does the same thing.

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:39.800
So when they said we
want something different,

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:40.640
we just started brainstorming.

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:41.550
What could we come up with?

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:43.300
And they said, a fight
scene would be fun.

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:44.170
So we said, why not?

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:45.640
And then we had to
find a location,

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:47.430
so I said loading dock, perhaps?

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:49.010
Loading dock on my studio.

00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:50.110
And then we needed props.

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:52.850
So props-- in my case,
we had a minimal budget.

00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:56.000
So we went to a dumpster, and we
just collected a bunch of crap

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.630
and just decorated this loading
dock, and did our photo shoot.

00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:02.074
Took about one entire day.

00:07:02.074 --> 00:07:03.490
At the end of the
day, we came out

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:05.580
with an image that
really was conceivably

00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:07.770
one of the most iconic
images that they've ever had.

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:09.170
And the cool thing about
people that want you

00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:11.400
because you're different,
because you stand out,

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:13.060
is that they're going to
want to hire you again

00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:14.101
for the next time around.

00:07:14.101 --> 00:07:16.946
So this time they
had a new singer,

00:07:16.946 --> 00:07:19.320
and they wanted to introduce
a new singer into the group.

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:20.361
So we did the same thing.

00:07:20.361 --> 00:07:22.890
We got them all
together, and they

00:07:22.890 --> 00:07:25.710
wanted to figure out a way
to introduce the new singer

00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:27.010
in a post-apocalyptic setting.

00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:30.910
So we said, hey, why
not suspend the girl

00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:34.390
and put in this factory kind
of setting and do a shoot?

00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:38.100
So I started Googling for
a forge-- which we found--

00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:41.050
and looking for ways to
suspend the girl, which we also

00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:41.637
figured out.

00:07:41.637 --> 00:07:44.220
And initially I want to do this
whole Photoshop deconstruction

00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:47.410
where pieces of her legs
were coming off and really

00:07:47.410 --> 00:07:49.972
cybernetic, but they
didn't want people

00:07:49.972 --> 00:07:51.930
to think that their new
singer was handicapped.

00:07:51.930 --> 00:07:54.220
So at the end of the day, she
needed all of her body parts,

00:07:54.220 --> 00:07:55.720
and we suspended her,
and did all this stuff.

00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:57.320
And there's actually going
to be a before and after.

00:07:57.320 --> 00:07:58.361
I'll show you guys later.

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:03.600
Other reasons why
I love photography

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:05.710
is the adventures
that it brings,

00:08:05.710 --> 00:08:08.550
the places that it brings you
that are completely unexpected.

00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:11.454
This was a shot that I took
in Belgium for a retoucher

00:08:11.454 --> 00:08:12.870
by the name of
Chester van Bommel.

00:08:12.870 --> 00:08:15.580
And I met Chester
on the internet,

00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:18.425
because I was looking at a
photographer whose work I quite

00:08:18.425 --> 00:08:20.300
enjoy-- her name is
Viona Art-- and I noticed

00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:22.508
on the bottom there was a
tiny little line that said,

00:08:22.508 --> 00:08:23.920
retouched by Chester van Bommel.

00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:25.110
And I'm like, hey,
this guy's pretty cool.

00:08:25.110 --> 00:08:26.400
He's got some great stuff.

00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:28.710
So I hit him up and said,
hey, we should work together.

00:08:28.710 --> 00:08:31.118
And that conversation
just-- it blossomed.

00:08:31.118 --> 00:08:32.909
We did a couple creative
products together.

00:08:32.909 --> 00:08:34.820
And then the time came when I
was actually going to Europe,

00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:37.400
and I said, you know, it
would be a really fun project

00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:39.220
to kind of take a shot of you.

00:08:39.220 --> 00:08:42.030
Show off what goes on in
the mind of a retoucher.

00:08:42.030 --> 00:08:44.069
And so we started
brainstorming different ideas,

00:08:44.069 --> 00:08:44.860
different concepts.

00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:46.420
I ended up in Belgium.

00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:49.360
I wanted to find a place that
was so grandiose that people

00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:52.955
would automatically assume
it's Photoshopped but wasn't.

00:08:52.955 --> 00:08:55.340
So I found an urban
explorer, who brought us

00:08:55.340 --> 00:08:57.810
to this place,
which is, I think,

00:08:57.810 --> 00:08:59.797
an abandoned stock exchange.

00:08:59.797 --> 00:09:01.880
And I did everything my
parents told me not to do,

00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:03.796
so that's meet up with
a stranger at 5 o'clock

00:09:03.796 --> 00:09:06.610
in the morning in a random
parking lot for the first time,

00:09:06.610 --> 00:09:09.410
and then go into a
manhole off on the street

00:09:09.410 --> 00:09:11.280
in the middle of
another foreign country.

00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:13.490
But then you end up in
this crazy situation,

00:09:13.490 --> 00:09:15.615
this crazy location,
that you would never ever

00:09:15.615 --> 00:09:17.740
have the chance to be in
unless I had a good excuse

00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:18.170
to go out there.

00:09:18.170 --> 00:09:19.730
Because I would never wake
up at 5 in the morning,

00:09:19.730 --> 00:09:21.524
I'd never talk to a
stranger, I would never

00:09:21.524 --> 00:09:23.190
go into a manhole to
end up in the place

00:09:23.190 --> 00:09:24.439
if I wasn't doing photography.

00:09:24.439 --> 00:09:26.704
So photography for me is
really about the experiences

00:09:26.704 --> 00:09:28.370
that I get to enjoy
through photography.

00:09:31.611 --> 00:09:33.360
Other things that I
love about photography

00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:35.193
are the technical
challenges that it brings.

00:09:35.193 --> 00:09:38.100
This was a shoot that I
did in a swimming pool.

00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:42.370
And I wanted to come up with
a different idea with one

00:09:42.370 --> 00:09:44.090
of my body painters.

00:09:44.090 --> 00:09:46.640
And we came up with the
idea of suspending a camera

00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:49.050
with a crane over a swimming
pool with some black lights

00:09:49.050 --> 00:09:51.800
going over, because it
hadn't been done before.

00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:54.120
So we ended up with this
crazy set, this whole group

00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:56.980
of people, with our super
high tech secure setting,

00:09:56.980 --> 00:10:01.000
here as you can see roped
together, MacGyvered together.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:02.760
And the shoot came together.

00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:05.580
I mean, it was probably one of
the most technically difficult

00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:06.790
shoots that I had ever done.

00:10:06.790 --> 00:10:09.150
Everything went
wrong in that shoot.

00:10:09.150 --> 00:10:12.390
And you know, I came up with
all these crazy ideas initially

00:10:12.390 --> 00:10:14.340
when sitting down with
this makeup artist.

00:10:14.340 --> 00:10:15.840
We were kind of
trying to figure out

00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:18.250
what hadn't been done before,
what would be really cool.

00:10:18.250 --> 00:10:20.166
Then we thought black
lights, but black lights

00:10:20.166 --> 00:10:23.150
had been done-- you know,
rave parties and all that.

00:10:23.150 --> 00:10:23.820
Not super cool.

00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:25.540
Then we wanted to sink the
black lights underwater

00:10:25.540 --> 00:10:26.670
and do a shoot
there, and then we

00:10:26.670 --> 00:10:28.150
didn't have the
technology to do it.

00:10:28.150 --> 00:10:29.420
So finally we
settled for something

00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:32.220
in the middle, which was suspend
the black lights over the water

00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:34.970
and have these characters body
painted kind of popping out

00:10:34.970 --> 00:10:36.050
through the surface.

00:10:36.050 --> 00:10:37.940
And I had this whole
storyline planned out.

00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:39.315
These are my
beautiful sketches--

00:10:39.315 --> 00:10:43.590
which is why I'm a photographer
not an artist-- of dropping

00:10:43.590 --> 00:10:45.299
a girl in the middle
of like a bed sheet.

00:10:45.299 --> 00:10:46.756
We thought it'd
look like a flower.

00:10:46.756 --> 00:10:47.810
It could symbolize birth.

00:10:47.810 --> 00:10:50.170
And that didn't work out--
the girl almost drowned.

00:10:50.170 --> 00:10:51.420
Well, she didn't almost drown.

00:10:51.420 --> 00:10:53.674
We had safety around, but
it just didn't look good.

00:10:53.674 --> 00:10:55.090
Then the next shoot
I wanted to do

00:10:55.090 --> 00:10:56.570
was tie these two
people together

00:10:56.570 --> 00:10:58.790
on the bottom of
the water to create

00:10:58.790 --> 00:11:00.784
like a tree kind
of a looking thing.

00:11:00.784 --> 00:11:02.950
That was supposed to symbolize
some kind of a union.

00:11:02.950 --> 00:11:04.908
And that didn't work,
because they could hardly

00:11:04.908 --> 00:11:07.670
swim on their own, let
alone being tied together.

00:11:07.670 --> 00:11:09.370
So that wasn't going to happen.

00:11:09.370 --> 00:11:11.094
So that went completely south.

00:11:11.094 --> 00:11:12.510
Then I had this
other idea where I

00:11:12.510 --> 00:11:15.437
wanted to create these little
like tadpole-looking things,

00:11:15.437 --> 00:11:17.020
these three creatures,
which were just

00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:19.874
supposed to symbolize
some form of life.

00:11:19.874 --> 00:11:21.040
And this one kind of worked.

00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:23.830
We took a rope, we dragged
all these three characters

00:11:23.830 --> 00:11:26.250
across the swimming pool and
just get them enough momentum

00:11:26.250 --> 00:11:28.037
so they're just floating along.

00:11:28.037 --> 00:11:29.870
And it worked, but it
didn't look very good.

00:11:29.870 --> 00:11:32.136
Then I had the first
breath of life,

00:11:32.136 --> 00:11:34.510
which was these three characters
coming out of the water,

00:11:34.510 --> 00:11:35.390
which is the one you just saw.

00:11:35.390 --> 00:11:36.890
Then I had death,
which was supposed

00:11:36.890 --> 00:11:39.306
to be the three of them lying
one on top of another, which

00:11:39.306 --> 00:11:41.460
looked remarkably like
life, but just not as good.

00:11:41.460 --> 00:11:43.835
So at the end of the day, I
had these elaborate concepts.

00:11:43.835 --> 00:11:47.450
We spent about 12, 10 hours
shooting the entire thing.

00:11:47.450 --> 00:11:49.120
A whole bunch of
things went wrong,

00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:50.620
but I got one good
shot out of it.

00:11:50.620 --> 00:11:54.550
And I suppose the moral of the
story is, I tried something.

00:11:54.550 --> 00:11:57.170
I push hard to try and achieve
it, failed a bunch of things

00:11:57.170 --> 00:11:59.420
along the way, but now I
know where my limitations lie

00:11:59.420 --> 00:12:01.120
on what I can achieve,
and what I can't achieve,

00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:03.220
and which parts to push,
and which parts to grow.

00:12:03.220 --> 00:12:05.270
And I really enjoy those
technical challenges,

00:12:05.270 --> 00:12:07.436
because if it were easy,
it wouldn't be worth doing.

00:12:09.459 --> 00:12:11.000
Other things I love
about photography

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:12.458
are the inspirational
people that I

00:12:12.458 --> 00:12:13.570
get to meet along the way.

00:12:13.570 --> 00:12:16.060
I think photography
opens up windows,

00:12:16.060 --> 00:12:18.030
and it's an avenue
of communication

00:12:18.030 --> 00:12:20.309
that everybody has access to.

00:12:20.309 --> 00:12:21.850
Doesn't matter if
you're rich, you're

00:12:21.850 --> 00:12:23.350
poor-- everyone
can look at a photo

00:12:23.350 --> 00:12:24.730
and understand
and appreciate it.

00:12:24.730 --> 00:12:27.519
And this has opened up
countless doors for me,

00:12:27.519 --> 00:12:29.310
just because I can just
reach out to people

00:12:29.310 --> 00:12:30.601
and say, hey, I do photography.

00:12:30.601 --> 00:12:32.486
I really like what you do.

00:12:32.486 --> 00:12:33.860
Let's work on
something together.

00:12:33.860 --> 00:12:35.901
And that's kind of my way
to connect with people.

00:12:35.901 --> 00:12:38.480
So this is a shot of
the Underwater Realm.

00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:39.980
And the Underwater
Realm is a group

00:12:39.980 --> 00:12:41.360
of independent filmmakers.

00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:43.651
Dave Reynolds-- the guy
sitting on the director's chair

00:12:43.651 --> 00:12:46.360
underwater-- actually decided
to make a series of short films

00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:48.943
underwater, and that's something
that hadn't been done before.

00:12:48.943 --> 00:12:50.800
So they Kickstarted
I think $150,000.

00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:53.730
And that guy's
like 26 years old,

00:12:53.730 --> 00:12:56.780
retaining a whole crew
of like 50 to 100 people

00:12:56.780 --> 00:12:59.960
for a two-year period--
all volunteers-- just

00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:01.460
to make this series
of short films

00:13:01.460 --> 00:13:02.420
that hadn't been done before.

00:13:02.420 --> 00:13:04.836
So when I saw their Kickstarter
campaign, I was like, wow,

00:13:04.836 --> 00:13:05.640
you are so cool.

00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:07.120
I want get to know you.

00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:08.620
I want to be a part
of your project.

00:13:08.620 --> 00:13:09.869
I want to participate in this.

00:13:09.869 --> 00:13:11.090
So I sent an email out.

00:13:11.090 --> 00:13:13.420
Surprisingly, they
replied, and they said,

00:13:13.420 --> 00:13:16.217
we'd love to work with
you, but you're in Montreal

00:13:16.217 --> 00:13:17.050
and we're in London.

00:13:17.050 --> 00:13:18.480
And at the time, I still
had an engineering job,

00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:20.400
so it just didn't
seem very feasible.

00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:22.970
But the connection had been
made, and that was great.

00:13:22.970 --> 00:13:24.200
Fast forward eight
months down the line.

00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:26.800
I was looking for inspirational
people across Europe to shoot.

00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:28.190
And I reached out to them
again, and I said, hey,

00:13:28.190 --> 00:13:29.420
would you like to be
a part of my project?

00:13:29.420 --> 00:13:31.378
And this time around, it
just ended up working.

00:13:31.378 --> 00:13:33.990
So I ended up in the middle
of the swimming pool,

00:13:33.990 --> 00:13:38.780
working with these guys who,
for me, are super inspirational.

00:13:38.780 --> 00:13:41.635
And I think those interactions
are so priceless and so

00:13:41.635 --> 00:13:43.706
impossible to have otherwise.

00:13:43.706 --> 00:13:46.570
You know, who goes through
these great lengths?

00:13:46.570 --> 00:13:50.470
They had this videographer
who shoots for the BBC.

00:13:50.470 --> 00:13:52.700
At the time, not many
underwater RED EPIC housings,

00:13:52.700 --> 00:13:54.520
and he came,
volunteered his time,

00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:56.800
just flew himself in just
to be a part of the project.

00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:58.170
They built entire
sets underwater.

00:13:58.170 --> 00:14:00.086
And I wasn't part of
this, because my shot was

00:14:00.086 --> 00:14:03.370
under the trial phase, but
to see this come together

00:14:03.370 --> 00:14:05.920
and to know that I actually
played a part in all of this

00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:08.010
is absolutely phenomenal.

00:14:08.010 --> 00:14:11.840
And it wouldn't have been
possible without photography.

00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:14.820
And last but not least, the
reason why I love photography

00:14:14.820 --> 00:14:17.220
is the ability to inspire
people, the ability

00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:20.660
to connect with
people of all levels.

00:14:20.660 --> 00:14:24.680
This was a shoot that I did,
and it was done in Florida.

00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:27.027
We made all the piece
of the costumes.

00:14:27.027 --> 00:14:28.610
We made the angel
wings, and all that.

00:14:28.610 --> 00:14:32.700
And how it came
together was I put up

00:14:32.700 --> 00:14:37.620
a photo of me breathing fire,
and this girl who is a Facebook

00:14:37.620 --> 00:14:40.540
friend tagged one of her friends
in it, and she left a comment

00:14:40.540 --> 00:14:43.070
and said, oh my
gosh, I'm never going

00:14:43.070 --> 00:14:44.622
to be as good as this guy.

00:14:44.622 --> 00:14:46.080
And I left the
comment, and I said,

00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:48.484
oh, try putting your camera
to this and this setting.

00:14:48.484 --> 00:14:50.400
And then she was like,
oh my gosh, he replied!

00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:52.590
And she sent me like this
huge Facebook message,

00:14:52.590 --> 00:14:54.490
just telling me that she'd
love for me to check out

00:14:54.490 --> 00:14:56.323
her portfolio, that she
was a video student,

00:14:56.323 --> 00:14:57.830
that she was also
a make-up artist.

00:14:57.830 --> 00:14:59.980
And then it took me about
a week to reply to her,

00:14:59.980 --> 00:15:01.650
but eventually when
we did reconnect,

00:15:01.650 --> 00:15:03.510
I learned that she was also
a special effects artist,

00:15:03.510 --> 00:15:06.310
she was off in Florida, and this
conversation just started out.

00:15:06.310 --> 00:15:11.894
And she said-- it started off
as this dare-- and she said,

00:15:11.894 --> 00:15:13.310
is there anything
that you've ever

00:15:13.310 --> 00:15:15.980
wanted to shoot that you haven't
had the chance to shoot yet?

00:15:15.980 --> 00:15:17.640
And then for some
reason, I said,

00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:19.311
I've always wanted
to shoot angel wings.

00:15:19.311 --> 00:15:21.310
I want someone to build
some angel wings for me.

00:15:21.310 --> 00:15:22.480
And she said, if
you come to Florida,

00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:23.970
I'll make the angel
wings for you.

00:15:23.970 --> 00:15:26.166
And I said, if you make
the angel wings for me,

00:15:26.166 --> 00:15:27.290
I'll fly myself to Florida.

00:15:27.290 --> 00:15:28.860
And she said, OK, and
she started making them.

00:15:28.860 --> 00:15:29.440
And I'm like aw, crap!

00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:30.710
So I've got to buy a ticket now.

00:15:30.710 --> 00:15:32.250
So I bought myself
a ticket to Florida.

00:15:32.250 --> 00:15:33.590
And we didn't really know
what we're going to do.

00:15:33.590 --> 00:15:35.700
And it all started off
with just this idea

00:15:35.700 --> 00:15:37.366
that we're going to
shoot a fallen angel

00:15:37.366 --> 00:15:38.620
in the middle of the forest.

00:15:38.620 --> 00:15:40.370
And I got to the first day.

00:15:40.370 --> 00:15:43.320
We went scouting, and we
saw this magical forest,

00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:45.160
and I just came up
with these ideas on how

00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:47.680
it would be nice to get the
concept even more elaborate.

00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:49.369
And by the time of
the shoot itself,

00:15:49.369 --> 00:15:50.410
it just scaled itself up.

00:15:50.410 --> 00:15:53.240
We ended up, I think, with
seven models, full costumes

00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:55.260
that we had built over
the space of a week.

00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:59.860
These wings were actually built
with just some packing plastics

00:15:59.860 --> 00:16:01.800
that we just strapped
to coat hangers,

00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:04.350
and we dusted off with charcoal.

00:16:04.350 --> 00:16:06.389
And it's just absolutely
cool and crazy to be

00:16:06.389 --> 00:16:07.680
able to do something like this.

00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:11.110
And on top of that, a company
called SmugMug-- actually based

00:16:11.110 --> 00:16:14.780
out of Mountainview--
also noticed this project.

00:16:14.780 --> 00:16:18.840
And they told me that since
I was in the United States,

00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:20.850
they'd love to come down
and document my work,

00:16:20.850 --> 00:16:22.850
because they thought it
was really inspirational

00:16:22.850 --> 00:16:25.744
and they wanted to share this
vision with just the community.

00:16:25.744 --> 00:16:27.410
So they flew their
own videographer down

00:16:27.410 --> 00:16:28.940
to make this piece
over here that I

00:16:28.940 --> 00:16:30.480
thought was
absolutely fantastic.

00:16:33.470 --> 00:16:36.980
Being creative has just
become a way of life.

00:16:36.980 --> 00:16:38.790
I don't think it
begins with the desire

00:16:38.790 --> 00:16:41.370
to wake up in the morning
and say, today, I'm creative.

00:16:41.370 --> 00:16:43.559
It just comes down to
today, I want to live,

00:16:43.559 --> 00:16:45.725
I want to do what I love,
and so I'm going to go out

00:16:45.725 --> 00:16:47.110
and I'm going to do that.

00:16:47.110 --> 00:16:49.275
My name is Benjamin von
Wong, and I'm an artist.

00:16:54.264 --> 00:16:56.430
I like to think of my
photography as something epic,

00:16:56.430 --> 00:16:58.440
something larger than life.

00:16:58.440 --> 00:17:00.230
It takes a vision
and exaggerates it,

00:17:00.230 --> 00:17:02.604
so that you can't tell the
difference between what's real

00:17:02.604 --> 00:17:05.099
and what's fake.

00:17:05.099 --> 00:17:07.456
I take a concept, and I
transform it into reality.

00:17:10.135 --> 00:17:11.760
I mean, I don't just
take the pictures.

00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:16.000
I conceptualize, I design them,
I create them, I build them up.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:17.460
It starts off with
a base concept,

00:17:17.460 --> 00:17:19.020
it starts off with an
idea, and it slowly

00:17:19.020 --> 00:17:20.730
builds up, based on
the constraints that

00:17:20.730 --> 00:17:21.450
have available.

00:17:21.450 --> 00:17:24.010
It's all about finding
solutions to make something that

00:17:24.010 --> 00:17:25.750
is seemingly impossible
and making it

00:17:25.750 --> 00:17:28.459
to something that is
better than reality.

00:17:31.730 --> 00:17:32.230
I

00:17:32.230 --> 00:17:33.570
Think that people
see photography

00:17:33.570 --> 00:17:35.420
as clicking a button,
getting the lighting right,

00:17:35.420 --> 00:17:36.660
getting the composition
right, but it's

00:17:36.660 --> 00:17:37.618
so much more than that.

00:17:37.618 --> 00:17:40.150
Being able to connect with
people is so important,

00:17:40.150 --> 00:17:41.640
and it shows in
the final results.

00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:42.800
If you understand
the story that you're

00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:43.940
trying to tell,
then suddenly they

00:17:43.940 --> 00:17:46.460
can translate that emotion,
making the image that much more

00:17:46.460 --> 00:17:47.840
powerful.

00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:49.820
I think that photos
can transport people

00:17:49.820 --> 00:17:51.760
into another universe,
into another world,

00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:53.647
and it becomes,
you know, a story.

00:17:53.647 --> 00:17:54.980
And people try to figure it out.

00:17:54.980 --> 00:17:56.670
They want to understand
what's going on,

00:17:56.670 --> 00:17:57.961
and that just makes it magical.

00:18:00.345 --> 00:18:02.470
I think that if you start
doing the things that you

00:18:02.470 --> 00:18:04.480
love, and you start sharing
the things that you love, then

00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:06.273
sooner or later, people
start hiring you to do things

00:18:06.273 --> 00:18:08.410
that you love, for your
passion, for your vision,

00:18:08.410 --> 00:18:10.800
for what makes you
unique, and because you're

00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:13.560
the only person that can
do whatever that thing is

00:18:13.560 --> 00:18:16.060
because you love it so much.

00:18:16.060 --> 00:18:19.685
My name is Benjamin von
Wong, and I a creative.

00:18:19.685 --> 00:18:23.670
So just think it's super cool
that a company would actually

00:18:23.670 --> 00:18:26.960
be so interested in what
I do that they would

00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:29.540
be willing to fly their own
person down to film this

00:18:29.540 --> 00:18:31.080
and share it with the world.

00:18:31.080 --> 00:18:34.540
And you meet people by
doing what you love,

00:18:34.540 --> 00:18:35.950
by being passionate
about things.

00:18:35.950 --> 00:18:37.380
And having the ability
to connect with people,

00:18:37.380 --> 00:18:39.670
you meet the people that
believe in what you do too.

00:18:39.670 --> 00:18:41.820
Incidentally, the reason
why I'm here today

00:18:41.820 --> 00:18:44.630
is because SmugMug decided
to bring me in and just say,

00:18:44.630 --> 00:18:48.630
hey, we really love what you
do, and we'd love to support it.

00:18:48.630 --> 00:18:49.130
Come down.

00:18:49.130 --> 00:18:50.190
We'll commission
some shoots for you.

00:18:50.190 --> 00:18:52.270
We don't really know what
we want to shoot yet.

00:18:52.270 --> 00:18:55.060
And we ended up suspending
some of their employees

00:18:55.060 --> 00:18:58.890
off of a 40 story
building just yesterday,

00:18:58.890 --> 00:19:01.180
with a camera dangling
nine feet off the ledge

00:19:01.180 --> 00:19:03.330
on this massive C-stand.

00:19:03.330 --> 00:19:05.362
We did a shoot so
that their employees

00:19:05.362 --> 00:19:07.070
could come and attend,
off in the forest,

00:19:07.070 --> 00:19:08.940
which is the one we
actually went to see,

00:19:08.940 --> 00:19:13.700
where we had designers flying
in from LA, five models coming

00:19:13.700 --> 00:19:16.850
in, just freezing their day
off in Sutro forest just to be

00:19:16.850 --> 00:19:18.420
a part of all these projects.

00:19:18.420 --> 00:19:20.739
And it's really, really
something amazing.

00:19:20.739 --> 00:19:22.280
And it didn't really
always start off

00:19:22.280 --> 00:19:23.320
with-- you don't
really start off

00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:25.194
saying like, oh, I want
to be an inspiration.

00:19:25.194 --> 00:19:26.970
I want to inspire people.

00:19:26.970 --> 00:19:30.950
It actually began with me-- when
I started giving presentations

00:19:30.950 --> 00:19:32.500
like these, I didn't
really know what

00:19:32.500 --> 00:19:33.708
I was supposed to talk about.

00:19:33.708 --> 00:19:37.220
So I went on Facebook and
I started asking for help.

00:19:37.220 --> 00:19:39.850
And I want to ask people what
they thought about my work,

00:19:39.850 --> 00:19:43.392
and have I made a difference,
have I contributed to them,

00:19:43.392 --> 00:19:45.350
have I touched them in
any way, shape, or form?

00:19:45.350 --> 00:19:48.314
And I got the predictable-- you
know, all the answers about how

00:19:48.314 --> 00:19:50.230
technically they've
learned a bunch of things.

00:19:50.230 --> 00:19:53.280
But then I came
across this one post

00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:54.584
by the name of Tyler Grace.

00:19:54.584 --> 00:19:56.250
And he said, I'm a
19-year-old teenager,

00:19:56.250 --> 00:19:57.670
and I've lived half
my life in a hospital

00:19:57.670 --> 00:19:59.360
thanks to a few
chronic illnesses.

00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:01.030
I had no passion or drive
to do anything in life

00:20:01.030 --> 00:20:01.900
at the beginning of last year.

00:20:01.900 --> 00:20:03.515
But in about May or
June, I came across you,

00:20:03.515 --> 00:20:05.060
and you are the one
person who really inspired

00:20:05.060 --> 00:20:06.800
me to actually pick up
my camera and actually

00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:09.370
be creative with it, rather than
just take happy snaps with it.

00:20:09.370 --> 00:20:10.760
Photography has changed
my life, I'm now

00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:12.100
in the process of
building a full-on photo

00:20:12.100 --> 00:20:14.160
studio at my dad's
video production studio,

00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:15.910
and I'm actually becoming a
known photographer around town.

00:20:15.910 --> 00:20:17.685
That is all thanks
to you inspiring me

00:20:17.685 --> 00:20:19.310
with your creativity
and awesome skill.

00:20:19.310 --> 00:20:21.300
Even on the days when
I can't get out of bed

00:20:21.300 --> 00:20:23.540
or I'm stuck at the hospital
or doctor's appointment,

00:20:23.540 --> 00:20:24.730
I'm planning out my next shoot.

00:20:24.730 --> 00:20:26.235
And this again is
all thanks to you.

00:20:26.235 --> 00:20:28.318
You inspire me to keep
fighting and keep shooting.

00:20:28.318 --> 00:20:29.344
Thank you so much.

00:20:29.344 --> 00:20:31.010
And I think that was
like the first time

00:20:31.010 --> 00:20:34.150
that someone had actually
said "you've changed my life"

00:20:34.150 --> 00:20:34.650
like that.

00:20:34.650 --> 00:20:36.720
What you're doing--
even if it had nothing

00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:39.174
to do with what he was doing--
really made the difference.

00:20:39.174 --> 00:20:41.090
And then suddenly that
sense of responsibility

00:20:41.090 --> 00:20:44.592
of knowing that people
are looking up to me

00:20:44.592 --> 00:20:47.690
and really paying attention
to what I was doing

00:20:47.690 --> 00:20:49.160
became super relevant.

00:20:49.160 --> 00:20:52.655
And I actually had the
chance to meet this guy just

00:20:52.655 --> 00:20:54.280
in February, because
I was in Singapore

00:20:54.280 --> 00:20:57.580
and his sister wrote
to me and said,

00:20:57.580 --> 00:20:59.890
hey, Tyler's 21st
birthday is coming on,

00:20:59.890 --> 00:21:01.350
and his dream is to meet you.

00:21:01.350 --> 00:21:03.566
But we can't really
afford to fly you in,

00:21:03.566 --> 00:21:06.240
so do you think you can make
a personalized video to him?

00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:08.202
And I said, well,
I'm in Singapore,

00:21:08.202 --> 00:21:09.910
and this is probably
the closest I'm ever

00:21:09.910 --> 00:21:10.951
going to be to Australia.

00:21:10.951 --> 00:21:12.620
I might as well just
fly myself down.

00:21:12.620 --> 00:21:16.429
So I pack myself into a box,
and I showed up at his doorstep.

00:21:16.429 --> 00:21:17.095
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:21:17.095 --> 00:21:21.170
So I've just gotten
off a 10 hour or so

00:21:21.170 --> 00:21:24.033
flight from Singapore
to [INAUDIBLE],

00:21:24.033 --> 00:21:28.963
and we're off to
surprise Tyler Grace.

00:21:28.963 --> 00:21:33.244
His 21st birthday's coming up,
and his wish was to meet me.

00:21:33.244 --> 00:21:35.202
So we're going to be
granting a wish right now,

00:21:35.202 --> 00:21:37.450
and that would involve
putting me in a box

00:21:37.450 --> 00:21:40.326
and showing up on his
doorstep, and taking him

00:21:40.326 --> 00:21:42.060
on a one-week adventure.

00:21:42.060 --> 00:21:45.120
So let's see how it goes.

00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:47.320
I want to strap a
GoPro onto my head

00:21:47.320 --> 00:21:50.240
so that when I pop out
of this magical box

00:21:50.240 --> 00:21:52.820
we can record Tyler's
astonished face.

00:21:52.820 --> 00:21:54.772
[KNOCKING]

00:21:59.652 --> 00:22:00.630
-Hi!

00:22:00.630 --> 00:22:02.514
-Happy birthday!

00:22:02.514 --> 00:22:05.286
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:10.034 --> 00:22:11.290
-Can I give you a hug?

00:22:11.290 --> 00:22:13.560
-Yeah.

00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:14.440
-How you doing?

00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:16.756
-Not too bad.

00:22:16.756 --> 00:22:17.380
-What the hell?

00:22:17.380 --> 00:22:19.320
-We decided to surprise you.

00:22:19.320 --> 00:22:20.055
-That is awesome.

00:22:26.844 --> 00:22:27.850
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:22:27.850 --> 00:22:28.490
BEN VON WONG: It
was at the point

00:22:28.490 --> 00:22:30.610
where basically what I
do right now is I travel,

00:22:30.610 --> 00:22:32.610
and I go on these adventures,
and I meet people.

00:22:32.610 --> 00:22:34.930
I'm this social media
content creator,

00:22:34.930 --> 00:22:36.499
where I'm empowered
by the people

00:22:36.499 --> 00:22:38.790
that I inspire through talks,
through conferences, that

00:22:38.790 --> 00:22:41.420
actually finances my trips
to go to the next place

00:22:41.420 --> 00:22:43.229
to keep shooting, to
keep doing things.

00:22:43.229 --> 00:22:45.270
And I realized I could do
exactly what I normally

00:22:45.270 --> 00:22:47.880
do-- I could just give a
conference, which would fund

00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:50.060
my trip to Australia--
but in the process,

00:22:50.060 --> 00:22:52.990
I could just drag along this
fan of mine for an adventure.

00:22:52.990 --> 00:22:56.862
And he's got fibromyalgia,
super sick, bedridden guy.

00:22:56.862 --> 00:22:58.320
And I didn't know
this at the time,

00:22:58.320 --> 00:22:59.986
but he's probably one
of my hugest fans.

00:22:59.986 --> 00:23:02.202
He's read like every single
one of my Facebook posts,

00:23:02.202 --> 00:23:03.160
blog posts, everything.

00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:04.535
He knew everything
about my life.

00:23:04.535 --> 00:23:06.460
It was crazy.

00:23:06.460 --> 00:23:08.617
And instead of just
showing up at his place,

00:23:08.617 --> 00:23:10.575
I decided to just drag
him out on an adventure.

00:23:10.575 --> 00:23:12.239
So we did a photo
shoot with him.

00:23:12.239 --> 00:23:13.780
I took pictures of
him and his sister

00:23:13.780 --> 00:23:16.142
like dragging him
through the mud.

00:23:16.142 --> 00:23:18.350
He's from Australia, he's
never seen a wild kangaroo.

00:23:18.350 --> 00:23:19.596
So we saw a wild kangaroo.

00:23:19.596 --> 00:23:20.720
He'd never been to a rodeo.

00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:21.295
We brought him to a rodeo.

00:23:21.295 --> 00:23:23.253
He'd never been on a
canoes since he was seven.

00:23:23.253 --> 00:23:24.360
And he wouldn't do that.

00:23:24.360 --> 00:23:26.610
I put together a photo shoot
so that he could actually

00:23:26.610 --> 00:23:28.270
attend it and see
what that was like.

00:23:28.270 --> 00:23:31.280
So it was exactly what
I normally did, and I

00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:33.110
did the behind the
scenes and everything,

00:23:33.110 --> 00:23:35.900
but this time around, it
actually really, really made

00:23:35.900 --> 00:23:37.589
an impact on this
one individual.

00:23:37.589 --> 00:23:39.380
And I thought that was
a fascinating story.

00:23:39.380 --> 00:23:43.091
So it's been a very,
very fun process,

00:23:43.091 --> 00:23:44.590
this whole evolution
of photography.

00:23:44.590 --> 00:23:46.548
So what I'm trying to
say at the end of the day

00:23:46.548 --> 00:23:49.890
is that photography is not
just clicking the button.

00:23:49.890 --> 00:23:52.820
For me, it's not about framing
a shot and clicking it.

00:23:52.820 --> 00:23:54.700
That process just
happens to be incidental,

00:23:54.700 --> 00:23:57.380
because it is the
vehicle for which I

00:23:57.380 --> 00:23:59.222
can do all the things
that I love to do.

00:23:59.222 --> 00:24:00.930
And I think that's
the same for everybody

00:24:00.930 --> 00:24:01.846
who picks up a camera.

00:24:01.846 --> 00:24:04.735
They don't pick it up because
they want to press that button.

00:24:04.735 --> 00:24:07.110
They pick it up because they
want to showcase an emotion.

00:24:07.110 --> 00:24:08.818
They want to transport
people to a place.

00:24:08.818 --> 00:24:11.560
They want to capture beauty
in some way, shape, or form.

00:24:11.560 --> 00:24:14.524
They want to show something
that doesn't exist.

00:24:14.524 --> 00:24:15.940
They want to create
something new.

00:24:15.940 --> 00:24:18.022
So photography has reasons.

00:24:18.022 --> 00:24:19.730
There's a reason why
you love photography

00:24:19.730 --> 00:24:21.146
and why it's special
to you, and I

00:24:21.146 --> 00:24:22.860
think it's always
important to remember

00:24:22.860 --> 00:24:25.940
what those reasons are.

00:24:25.940 --> 00:24:26.440
Questions?

00:24:32.952 --> 00:24:34.160
You guys are terrified of me.

00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:35.130
Or you're sleeping.

00:24:35.130 --> 00:24:35.630
Yes.

00:24:35.630 --> 00:24:42.220
AUDIENCE: So what clicked so you
turned from the engineering job

00:24:42.220 --> 00:24:44.530
to the photography job?

00:24:44.530 --> 00:24:47.960
What was it inside of you
that made that happen?

00:24:47.960 --> 00:24:50.570
BEN VON WONG: I got bored
of engineering, and I quit.

00:24:50.570 --> 00:24:54.100
And then incidentally, I became
a photographer by default,

00:24:54.100 --> 00:24:56.310
because that was the
only thing I was doing.

00:24:56.310 --> 00:24:58.475
It wasn't really planned.

00:24:58.475 --> 00:24:59.600
I got bored of engineering.

00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:01.433
But I actually go over
that in the next part

00:25:01.433 --> 00:25:03.790
where I can talk
about the timeline.

00:25:03.790 --> 00:25:05.628
Cool?

00:25:05.628 --> 00:25:07.860
So I'll move forward.

00:25:07.860 --> 00:25:12.260
So I have this quote
from Ernest Hemingway,

00:25:12.260 --> 00:25:14.740
and it says, "It is good to
have an end to journey towards,

00:25:14.740 --> 00:25:16.930
but it is the journey
that matters in the end."

00:25:16.930 --> 00:25:19.480
and I think that just a
really important quote,

00:25:19.480 --> 00:25:21.480
because at the end of the
day, I think something

00:25:21.480 --> 00:25:25.392
that I realized along the way is
that you spend a lot more time

00:25:25.392 --> 00:25:26.850
trying to get to
somewhere than you

00:25:26.850 --> 00:25:28.770
do when actually
spending time there.

00:25:28.770 --> 00:25:32.630
And it's kind of funny, because
you set these really lofty

00:25:32.630 --> 00:25:35.244
goals, and then
suddenly you reach them.

00:25:35.244 --> 00:25:36.910
And then you need to
set something else,

00:25:36.910 --> 00:25:38.120
because there's nothing
else to do about it,

00:25:38.120 --> 00:25:39.170
because you've
already achieved it.

00:25:39.170 --> 00:25:40.620
And it gets really boring.

00:25:40.620 --> 00:25:42.286
And if anything--
in my case, I've

00:25:42.286 --> 00:25:44.160
found it disappointing
once I've achieved it,

00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:45.035
because I'm like that's it?

00:25:45.035 --> 00:25:47.659
I've gotten there already, then
just try to keep aiming higher.

00:25:47.659 --> 00:25:49.730
So I think it's always
really important

00:25:49.730 --> 00:25:52.460
to realize what you've
achieved up to now,

00:25:52.460 --> 00:25:54.040
where it's brought
you, and it just

00:25:54.040 --> 00:25:55.998
makes life a lot more
interesting along the way

00:25:55.998 --> 00:25:58.540
if you can just
reach these points.

00:25:58.540 --> 00:26:02.840
Just to give you guys a quick
example, I think two days ago,

00:26:02.840 --> 00:26:05.160
I had a day off, and I
spontaneously decided to hop

00:26:05.160 --> 00:26:08.360
in the car and drive
to the Apple campus,

00:26:08.360 --> 00:26:11.080
where incidentally got kicked
out because it was a Sunday.

00:26:11.080 --> 00:26:12.880
And we snuck in when
the door was open.

00:26:15.670 --> 00:26:17.349
I just sat on top
of the Apple sign

00:26:17.349 --> 00:26:19.640
and took a photo on Instagram,
and I was just so happy,

00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:22.080
because I was just
in Apple campus.

00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:24.012
And I've read the
biographies of Steve Jobs,

00:26:24.012 --> 00:26:25.220
and I've seen all that stuff.

00:26:25.220 --> 00:26:27.330
Or even being here today,
just these little moments

00:26:27.330 --> 00:26:28.788
in time, these
slices of time, just

00:26:28.788 --> 00:26:30.629
to be like, what
am I doing here?

00:26:30.629 --> 00:26:31.420
How did I get here?

00:26:31.420 --> 00:26:32.480
This is crazy.

00:26:32.480 --> 00:26:35.050
It's just really, really fun
to sit back and appreciate

00:26:35.050 --> 00:26:36.250
what you've gotten.

00:26:36.250 --> 00:26:39.730
And keeping that
in mind, I'm going

00:26:39.730 --> 00:26:44.250
to talk about the process on how
this Von Wong moniker actually

00:26:44.250 --> 00:26:46.560
came to be, like how did
I become this character?

00:26:46.560 --> 00:26:47.850
By the way, for those of
you who are wondering,

00:26:47.850 --> 00:26:49.110
Von Wong is not my real name.

00:26:49.110 --> 00:26:50.210
It doesn't exist.

00:26:50.210 --> 00:26:52.090
Von is German.
"Von" means "from."

00:26:52.090 --> 00:26:54.149
So when I was inventing
a name-- or actually,

00:26:54.149 --> 00:26:55.690
the first thing you
do when you start

00:26:55.690 --> 00:26:57.300
looking for your own website
is you put your own name

00:26:57.300 --> 00:26:57.860
into Google.

00:26:57.860 --> 00:27:01.130
And the first name
that came up was

00:27:01.130 --> 00:27:02.884
Benjamin Wong, which
is my real name,

00:27:02.884 --> 00:27:05.300
was another photographer that
did weddings off in Toronto.

00:27:05.300 --> 00:27:06.133
I was like, hell no.

00:27:06.133 --> 00:27:07.090
That's not gonna work.

00:27:07.090 --> 00:27:10.470
So I decided to invent something
that would be a little bit more

00:27:10.470 --> 00:27:11.480
exciting and marketable.

00:27:11.480 --> 00:27:14.400
And then "from" in German,
from the family of Wong,

00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:15.900
just seemed kind
of catchy and cute.

00:27:15.900 --> 00:27:17.290
It actually sounded
really corny at the time,

00:27:17.290 --> 00:27:18.020
but now it sounds pretty cool.

00:27:18.020 --> 00:27:20.320
I've got people calling me
Mr. Von, which is hilarious.

00:27:20.320 --> 00:27:22.189
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:22.189 --> 00:27:23.730
But anyway, so the
birth of Von Wong.

00:27:23.730 --> 00:27:25.210
And it didn't all start
off like-- you know,

00:27:25.210 --> 00:27:27.320
I don't have one of those
crazy awesome stories

00:27:27.320 --> 00:27:29.730
that people got a camera
at the age of three

00:27:29.730 --> 00:27:31.900
by their grandfather,
and their eyes

00:27:31.900 --> 00:27:36.540
lit up when they saw
the first frame happen.

00:27:36.540 --> 00:27:38.460
My story is a little
bit more mundane.

00:27:38.460 --> 00:27:42.790
I was working in a mine in
Winnemucca, Nevada, in 2007.

00:27:42.790 --> 00:27:44.390
And around this
timeframe-- you can

00:27:44.390 --> 00:27:46.910
see the nice little
timestamp on the bottom--

00:27:46.910 --> 00:27:48.110
this girl breaks up with me.

00:27:48.110 --> 00:27:50.930
And I decide that, if
I don't find something

00:27:50.930 --> 00:27:54.340
to do to keep myself busy
in this small town of 10,000

00:27:54.340 --> 00:27:56.420
people with two
Chinese people, I'm

00:27:56.420 --> 00:27:58.100
going to go absolutely crazy.

00:27:58.100 --> 00:28:00.650
So I decided that,
why not go out there

00:28:00.650 --> 00:28:02.380
and take pictures of the stars?

00:28:02.380 --> 00:28:03.330
Stars are pretty.

00:28:03.330 --> 00:28:04.960
So I went to Walmart,
bought a point and shoot,

00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:06.050
tried to take a
picture of the stars.

00:28:06.050 --> 00:28:06.890
Wasn't good enough.

00:28:06.890 --> 00:28:08.080
Returned it and bought
the bigger camera,

00:28:08.080 --> 00:28:09.390
the more expensive one.

00:28:09.390 --> 00:28:11.710
And it was also not good
enough, so I returned that.

00:28:11.710 --> 00:28:14.325
And I had to drive to the next
city over to go buy a DSLR.

00:28:14.325 --> 00:28:16.040
And I remember going in
there, and I just didn't even

00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:17.039
know what to do with it.

00:28:17.039 --> 00:28:19.030
I just kind of said,
how do you turn it on?

00:28:19.030 --> 00:28:20.830
Because you have to
look in the viewfinder.

00:28:20.830 --> 00:28:23.090
So the guy said, what you want?

00:28:23.090 --> 00:28:25.740
I said just get me any
camera that's about $800.

00:28:25.740 --> 00:28:28.930
And he kidded me
with a Pentax K100D.

00:28:28.930 --> 00:28:30.830
Then I took that,
went to Starbucks,

00:28:30.830 --> 00:28:32.020
sat down, read the manual.

00:28:32.020 --> 00:28:35.120
And then by that evening, I just
drove out, slept in the car,

00:28:35.120 --> 00:28:37.330
and I took my first
photo of the stars, which

00:28:37.330 --> 00:28:40.020
you can see this fantastic
masterpiece over here.

00:28:40.020 --> 00:28:41.889
Entirely grainy,
nothing spectacular,

00:28:41.889 --> 00:28:43.180
but I was really, really happy.

00:28:43.180 --> 00:28:45.670
I had my photograph of stars.

00:28:45.670 --> 00:28:47.821
And this was the
first photo that I

00:28:47.821 --> 00:28:49.320
guess that I ever
successfully took.

00:28:49.320 --> 00:28:50.740
And probably one of the
last-- I haven't really

00:28:50.740 --> 00:28:51.990
taken pictures of stars since.

00:28:51.990 --> 00:28:53.590
But by that point,
I had a camera,

00:28:53.590 --> 00:28:55.129
and it became my
travel companion.

00:28:55.129 --> 00:28:56.670
I brought it around
everywhere, and I

00:28:56.670 --> 00:28:58.010
became that really
annoying Asian guy

00:28:58.010 --> 00:28:59.801
with a camera that
brings it to everything.

00:28:59.801 --> 00:29:01.849
So every party, every
event, every time

00:29:01.849 --> 00:29:03.640
I was out on the street,
I had this camera.

00:29:03.640 --> 00:29:06.430
I joined every single
photo club that I could.

00:29:06.430 --> 00:29:09.220
And then I made a new girlfriend
who was also a photographer,

00:29:09.220 --> 00:29:12.190
and that whole thing
just started building up.

00:29:12.190 --> 00:29:15.261
And as the way things
go, the more you shoot,

00:29:15.261 --> 00:29:16.760
eventually you start
meeting people.

00:29:16.760 --> 00:29:19.957
And one of my friends was
actually an event photographer,

00:29:19.957 --> 00:29:21.790
and he couldn't make
it to an event anymore.

00:29:21.790 --> 00:29:23.456
They had dropped the
rates a little bit.

00:29:23.456 --> 00:29:26.639
And he said, hey, I can't
make it to this event.

00:29:26.639 --> 00:29:27.680
They don't pay that well.

00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:30.960
It's like about
$200 for five hours.

00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:34.437
There'll be pretty
girls and free alcohol.

00:29:34.437 --> 00:29:35.770
Do you want to help me cover it?

00:29:35.770 --> 00:29:37.340
And I said, sure, no problem.

00:29:37.340 --> 00:29:38.965
So I went and I shot
this first event.

00:29:38.965 --> 00:29:41.620
And I remember I rented a
monopod so that my camera would

00:29:41.620 --> 00:29:44.220
look bigger and
more professional.

00:29:44.220 --> 00:29:47.160
And I did my first shoot.

00:29:47.160 --> 00:29:49.230
And this is the first
time that I had actually

00:29:49.230 --> 00:29:51.060
gotten paid to do photography.

00:29:51.060 --> 00:29:53.060
And it really clicked
something in my mind,

00:29:53.060 --> 00:29:54.893
which was the first
time that I had actually

00:29:54.893 --> 00:29:56.960
gotten paid to do something
that I enjoyed to do.

00:29:56.960 --> 00:29:59.460
Now, usually you pay money to
do things that you like to do.

00:29:59.460 --> 00:30:01.845
But this time, I was getting
paid to have a good time,

00:30:01.845 --> 00:30:03.970
to go drink and take pictures
and do all this stuff

00:30:03.970 --> 00:30:04.734
and meet people.

00:30:04.734 --> 00:30:05.900
It was absolutely fantastic.

00:30:05.900 --> 00:30:08.335
So I used that as an excuse
to buy a whole bunch of gear.

00:30:08.335 --> 00:30:10.210
Thankfully, I was an
engineer, so buying gear

00:30:10.210 --> 00:30:10.977
wasn't a problem.

00:30:10.977 --> 00:30:13.310
Went out there, bought some
more gear, started shooting.

00:30:13.310 --> 00:30:15.360
And I was shooting like
three, four times a week.

00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:16.890
And I shot everything,
it didn't really matter.

00:30:16.890 --> 00:30:18.460
I just brought my camera out.

00:30:18.460 --> 00:30:19.810
I was shooting bands,
I was shooting events,

00:30:19.810 --> 00:30:20.475
I was shooting protests.

00:30:20.475 --> 00:30:23.016
I was just getting myself into
all sorts of weird situations.

00:30:23.016 --> 00:30:25.540
And photography was just
that companion of mine.

00:30:25.540 --> 00:30:27.290
And it didn't just
stop at events.

00:30:27.290 --> 00:30:30.520
It also extended-- you do just
a little bit of everything.

00:30:30.520 --> 00:30:32.520
So in my case, I shot a
little bit of portraits,

00:30:32.520 --> 00:30:34.770
I shot some engagement things,
I tried my hat at levitation.

00:30:34.770 --> 00:30:35.575
Even let a little
bit of Photoshop

00:30:35.575 --> 00:30:37.824
in-- you can see the fantastic
smoky effect over there

00:30:37.824 --> 00:30:39.705
on the left.

00:30:39.705 --> 00:30:41.830
It's just all part of that
process of just growing.

00:30:41.830 --> 00:30:43.788
But I was getting out
there and I was shooting,

00:30:43.788 --> 00:30:46.050
and then invariably when
you start shooting enough,

00:30:46.050 --> 00:30:47.240
you start getting a
little bit better.

00:30:47.240 --> 00:30:48.779
You start shooting
bigger events.

00:30:48.779 --> 00:30:50.070
Things start going really well.

00:30:50.070 --> 00:30:51.730
You fall into weddings,
because everyone ends up

00:30:51.730 --> 00:30:53.540
shooting weddings at one point
in their time in the photo

00:30:53.540 --> 00:30:54.099
career.

00:30:54.099 --> 00:30:56.140
And the photos are actually
getting quite decent,

00:30:56.140 --> 00:30:59.070
and business was going
really, really well.

00:30:59.070 --> 00:31:01.540
But then what happened was
I got into another break-up.

00:31:01.540 --> 00:31:03.166
So break-ups are
these fantastic events

00:31:03.166 --> 00:31:05.706
in my life where you question
every single thing that happens

00:31:05.706 --> 00:31:07.130
to you, and you
wonder why you're

00:31:07.130 --> 00:31:08.213
in these weird situations.

00:31:08.213 --> 00:31:11.215
And then in my case, I
came to the realization

00:31:11.215 --> 00:31:13.340
that I had two jobs at the
time-- I had engineering

00:31:13.340 --> 00:31:14.980
and I had photography.

00:31:14.980 --> 00:31:19.529
And that wasn't what I had
originally set out to do.

00:31:19.529 --> 00:31:21.320
I had engineering as
a job, and photography

00:31:21.320 --> 00:31:22.730
was supposed to
be the fun thing.

00:31:22.730 --> 00:31:25.860
But at this point, it
had become two really

00:31:25.860 --> 00:31:28.490
time consuming,
exhausting activities.

00:31:28.490 --> 00:31:30.200
And I kind of did
the calculations.

00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:31.783
I said, well, I
didn't need the money,

00:31:31.783 --> 00:31:34.864
so this wasn't what I
wanted to do in photography,

00:31:34.864 --> 00:31:35.780
so why was I doing it?

00:31:35.780 --> 00:31:37.970
So I just dropped the
entire event set of things,

00:31:37.970 --> 00:31:39.720
bought some new
equipment, some new studio

00:31:39.720 --> 00:31:42.010
flashes, and tossed
myself into this project--

00:31:42.010 --> 00:31:45.450
the 365 project-- which is to
take one photo a day every day

00:31:45.450 --> 00:31:47.160
for 365 days.

00:31:47.160 --> 00:31:48.440
I failed.

00:31:48.440 --> 00:31:50.500
365 days is a long time.

00:31:50.500 --> 00:31:52.740
So incidentally, I only
got about 100 days in.

00:31:52.740 --> 00:31:54.810
But through that
process, I really

00:31:54.810 --> 00:31:57.057
got the chance to
grow as an artist.

00:31:57.057 --> 00:31:59.140
Every single day, I had
to come up with new ideas,

00:31:59.140 --> 00:32:00.514
so eventually I
ran out of models

00:32:00.514 --> 00:32:03.120
that I could actually collect
within the timeframe necessary,

00:32:03.120 --> 00:32:07.149
so I started learning a lot
of Photoshop to compensate.

00:32:07.149 --> 00:32:08.940
It was just this really
good growth process

00:32:08.940 --> 00:32:10.610
of just growing and
growing and growing.

00:32:10.610 --> 00:32:12.026
And when I decided
to quit, it was

00:32:12.026 --> 00:32:15.570
because I wasn't able to
sustain this many photo shoots.

00:32:15.570 --> 00:32:17.897
And I hit 100 days,
and I told myself

00:32:17.897 --> 00:32:19.480
that, well, now that
I have more time,

00:32:19.480 --> 00:32:21.438
I might as well do these
more elaborate shoots,

00:32:21.438 --> 00:32:23.880
start collaborating with
different individuals,

00:32:23.880 --> 00:32:25.900
taking more time to
go to cooler places.

00:32:25.900 --> 00:32:28.035
And that's where I
think my style started

00:32:28.035 --> 00:32:29.750
to get shaped a little bit more.

00:32:29.750 --> 00:32:32.840
You see we have me exploring
some abandoned building,

00:32:32.840 --> 00:32:35.446
dressing people up,
going to studios,

00:32:35.446 --> 00:32:36.570
suspending people together.

00:32:36.570 --> 00:32:37.440
There's actually a chair there.

00:32:37.440 --> 00:32:39.398
Just by Photoshopping it
and rotating the foot,

00:32:39.398 --> 00:32:42.560
you have this beautiful
levitation effect.

00:32:42.560 --> 00:32:44.930
And, you know, breaking
into abandoned places

00:32:44.930 --> 00:32:46.060
with guys with guns.

00:32:46.060 --> 00:32:48.670
Always a good idea.

00:32:48.670 --> 00:32:50.920
Doing everything from school
project-- Shades of Gray

00:32:50.920 --> 00:32:53.740
was a student project
from Concordia.

00:32:53.740 --> 00:32:55.929
I also started working
with body-painters.

00:32:55.929 --> 00:32:57.720
So all the weird-- all
the eclectic things.

00:32:57.720 --> 00:32:59.594
I started experimenting
with special effects.

00:32:59.594 --> 00:33:01.590
We had a smoke machine
in the center image,

00:33:01.590 --> 00:33:03.048
and the one completely
on the right

00:33:03.048 --> 00:33:06.970
is one where we-- I was
shooting on a bridge,

00:33:06.970 --> 00:33:09.482
I flipped the camera upside-down
super close to the water.

00:33:09.482 --> 00:33:11.190
We tossed dry ice into
the lake, and then

00:33:11.190 --> 00:33:12.960
bam, we had this crazy
super smoky effect.

00:33:12.960 --> 00:33:14.840
It was getting
really, really cool.

00:33:14.840 --> 00:33:15.900
And then as the
shoots went on, they

00:33:15.900 --> 00:33:17.300
started getting a little
bit more elaborate,

00:33:17.300 --> 00:33:19.341
I started getting more
people, experimenting more

00:33:19.341 --> 00:33:20.760
in Photoshop,
played with zombies.

00:33:20.760 --> 00:33:21.718
Everyone plays zombies.

00:33:21.718 --> 00:33:24.272
Just like what weddings--
it's a recurrent theme.

00:33:24.272 --> 00:33:25.230
And I had some zombies.

00:33:25.230 --> 00:33:26.940
I started playing with
a little bit of fire.

00:33:26.940 --> 00:33:27.750
And you know, the
shoots just start

00:33:27.750 --> 00:33:28.790
getting bigger and
bigger and bigger,

00:33:28.790 --> 00:33:30.206
and then eventually
I just decided

00:33:30.206 --> 00:33:32.730
to quit my job as an engineer.

00:33:32.730 --> 00:33:36.060
So there are a couple
actual points in time

00:33:36.060 --> 00:33:38.126
that led to me
becoming this Von Wong,

00:33:38.126 --> 00:33:39.750
and I'm going to try
to break them down

00:33:39.750 --> 00:33:41.430
into these little categories.

00:33:41.430 --> 00:33:46.580
And the first kind of moment
that defined my career

00:33:46.580 --> 00:33:47.550
was in 2008.

00:33:47.550 --> 00:33:51.959
And 2008 was the discovery
of something magical

00:33:51.959 --> 00:33:52.750
called speedlights.

00:33:52.750 --> 00:33:55.120
So at the time, I had a
D300, I had an 18 and 200,

00:33:55.120 --> 00:33:57.074
and I had an SB 900 thing.

00:33:57.074 --> 00:33:58.490
And I was like,
OK, this is great.

00:33:58.490 --> 00:33:59.900
I don't need anything more.

00:33:59.900 --> 00:34:01.819
We're going to be set
for the rest of my life.

00:34:01.819 --> 00:34:02.610
It does everything.

00:34:02.610 --> 00:34:06.020
And I was wrong.

00:34:06.020 --> 00:34:08.750
I went to this free event
hosted by the Strobist community

00:34:08.750 --> 00:34:09.679
in Montreal.

00:34:09.679 --> 00:34:11.429
And you know what
happens in these events.

00:34:11.429 --> 00:34:13.810
There's like a semicircle of
photographers, and one person

00:34:13.810 --> 00:34:15.601
there, and everyone's
taking the same photo

00:34:15.601 --> 00:34:17.239
from a slightly different angle.

00:34:17.239 --> 00:34:18.679
But this time around,
someone just came up to me,

00:34:18.679 --> 00:34:20.850
and they handed me like
a little trigger dongle,

00:34:20.850 --> 00:34:23.266
and I just slapped that onto
my camera and took a picture.

00:34:23.266 --> 00:34:24.949
And then suddenly,
my photo in my hand

00:34:24.949 --> 00:34:28.612
was completely different
from what everyone else had.

00:34:28.612 --> 00:34:29.570
I like to be different.

00:34:29.570 --> 00:34:30.861
I think it's because I'm Asian.

00:34:30.861 --> 00:34:33.350
I have this complex I
need to be different.

00:34:33.350 --> 00:34:36.614
So I just said, what we
really need-- this is amazing.

00:34:36.614 --> 00:34:38.030
I get to tell
stories with this, I

00:34:38.030 --> 00:34:39.690
can create things
that are different,

00:34:39.690 --> 00:34:42.520
I can start getting
a lot more creative.

00:34:42.520 --> 00:34:45.176
And then that's when really
my style went from stuff

00:34:45.176 --> 00:34:47.550
like this-- which is general,
really compositional based,

00:34:47.550 --> 00:34:50.092
these photo ops of
friends of friends

00:34:50.092 --> 00:34:51.550
going to interesting
places, taking

00:34:51.550 --> 00:34:56.494
all the different like oddball
poses-- to finally starting

00:34:56.494 --> 00:34:58.660
to get a lot more creative,
a lot more experimental.

00:34:58.660 --> 00:35:01.320
Now, the photos are by no
means anything too fantastical,

00:35:01.320 --> 00:35:03.960
but they really opened up
this vessel for creativity.

00:35:03.960 --> 00:35:07.280
And since I started doing these
lighting set-ups and these more

00:35:07.280 --> 00:35:10.775
elaborate looks and
dos, then Photoshop also

00:35:10.775 --> 00:35:11.790
kind of came into place.

00:35:11.790 --> 00:35:15.120
So it was this vessel learning,
because it just opened up

00:35:15.120 --> 00:35:18.370
this world possibilities to me.

00:35:18.370 --> 00:35:22.160
In 201o-- so between 2008,
2010, pretty much the same thing

00:35:22.160 --> 00:35:22.820
happened.

00:35:22.820 --> 00:35:23.560
I kept shooting.

00:35:23.560 --> 00:35:24.850
I got better.

00:35:24.850 --> 00:35:29.020
My shoots got a little bit
more elaborate, like I said.

00:35:29.020 --> 00:35:30.640
But what really
changed in 2010 was

00:35:30.640 --> 00:35:33.474
that I did a shoot
where I actually

00:35:33.474 --> 00:35:34.890
recorded a
behind-the-scene video.

00:35:34.890 --> 00:35:36.250
So you can see the photos.

00:35:36.250 --> 00:35:38.892
They're pretty cool, but
not necessarily any cooler

00:35:38.892 --> 00:35:40.850
than any of the other
images that I was taking.

00:35:40.850 --> 00:35:41.760
It was done with flour.

00:35:41.760 --> 00:35:42.390
We went into a studio.

00:35:42.390 --> 00:35:43.806
We tossed flour
all over the place

00:35:43.806 --> 00:35:45.030
and made a huge mess of it.

00:35:45.030 --> 00:35:45.782
It was great.

00:35:45.782 --> 00:35:48.240
And the one difference, though,
is that this time around, I

00:35:48.240 --> 00:35:50.417
had a behind the scene
videographer come in.

00:35:50.417 --> 00:35:52.500
And actually it was my
ex-girlfriend at the time--

00:35:52.500 --> 00:35:54.780
my girlfriend the time--
who really, really wanted

00:35:54.780 --> 00:35:56.559
me to start doing
behind-the-scene videos.

00:35:56.559 --> 00:35:58.350
And I remember arguing
with her and saying,

00:35:58.350 --> 00:36:01.760
why would anyone want
to see what I do you?

00:36:01.760 --> 00:36:02.690
It would be boring.

00:36:02.690 --> 00:36:03.731
There's no reason for it.

00:36:03.731 --> 00:36:05.600
And she really argued
hard against it.

00:36:05.600 --> 00:36:08.030
So eventually went to Future
Shop, bought a camera,

00:36:08.030 --> 00:36:10.310
and returned it
every other week just

00:36:10.310 --> 00:36:12.480
to record these video
footages, and started

00:36:12.480 --> 00:36:14.630
making these
behind-the-scene videos.

00:36:14.630 --> 00:36:16.859
And what happened
was the same photo,

00:36:16.859 --> 00:36:19.400
the same shoots that I had spent
the same amount of time that

00:36:19.400 --> 00:36:22.352
were just as cool, because they
had a behind-the-scene video

00:36:22.352 --> 00:36:24.310
suddenly meant that they
were getting picked up

00:36:24.310 --> 00:36:25.810
by all of these up
and coming blogs.

00:36:25.810 --> 00:36:28.830
So like DIY photography,
Fstoppers, and all this stuff.

00:36:28.830 --> 00:36:30.962
So those same photos that
I was creating suddenly

00:36:30.962 --> 00:36:32.920
had gained a lot more
traction on the internet.

00:36:32.920 --> 00:36:35.180
So I told myself
that from this point

00:36:35.180 --> 00:36:37.420
forward, if ever I
did a photo shoot,

00:36:37.420 --> 00:36:39.440
I'd have to have a
behind-the-scene scene video,

00:36:39.440 --> 00:36:42.020
because the same images
were getting seen more.

00:36:42.020 --> 00:36:44.870
And if we don't create
to share, then why do you

00:36:44.870 --> 00:36:46.515
bother creating
in the first place

00:36:46.515 --> 00:36:49.170
if no one's going
to see it, right?

00:36:49.170 --> 00:36:50.820
That was a huge thing for me.

00:36:50.820 --> 00:36:52.150
And then we hit 2012.

00:36:52.150 --> 00:36:54.366
So between 2010, 2012,
not much happened.

00:36:54.366 --> 00:36:55.240
I just kept shooting.

00:36:55.240 --> 00:36:56.100
I kept videoing.

00:36:56.100 --> 00:36:58.910
My internet popularity
started to grow.

00:36:58.910 --> 00:37:02.400
But 2012 was when I decided
to quit my job as an engineer.

00:37:02.400 --> 00:37:04.130
So as I said, I
woke up one morning,

00:37:04.130 --> 00:37:06.760
and it was after three and
a half years of engineering.

00:37:06.760 --> 00:37:08.510
I had kind of passed
that little threshold

00:37:08.510 --> 00:37:11.720
that takes you from junior
engineer to engineer.

00:37:11.720 --> 00:37:15.210
And that's a little chapter, so
I'm supposed to get a pay jump,

00:37:15.210 --> 00:37:16.470
and all that good stuff.

00:37:16.470 --> 00:37:18.600
And then I figure that,
you know, what's next?

00:37:18.600 --> 00:37:20.444
If I keep going
this, and another 10

00:37:20.444 --> 00:37:23.110
years of engineering, I can keep
climbing the food chain slowly.

00:37:23.110 --> 00:37:24.630
But it wasn't what
I wanted to do.

00:37:24.630 --> 00:37:25.810
So I didn't need money.

00:37:25.810 --> 00:37:27.160
I had put money away in savings.

00:37:27.160 --> 00:37:28.720
I was still living
with my parents.

00:37:28.720 --> 00:37:30.802
So all this stuff-- there
was no reason for me

00:37:30.802 --> 00:37:32.010
to keep going in engineering.

00:37:32.010 --> 00:37:34.870
So I made up my mind,
I think, in the space

00:37:34.870 --> 00:37:37.140
of 10 minutes waking up in
the morning that I'm done.

00:37:37.140 --> 00:37:38.282
I'm going to quit.

00:37:38.282 --> 00:37:39.740
The decision to
convince my parents

00:37:39.740 --> 00:37:42.070
was a little bit harder,
though, since they

00:37:42.070 --> 00:37:44.120
weren't totally
stoked about the idea.

00:37:44.120 --> 00:37:45.850
And I kind of
tricked them and said

00:37:45.850 --> 00:37:47.900
that I was going to do an MBA.

00:37:47.900 --> 00:37:49.950
And I fully had the
intention of doing an MBA,

00:37:49.950 --> 00:37:51.700
until I started sitting
down and realizing

00:37:51.700 --> 00:37:53.040
that for two years of
my life, I was going

00:37:53.040 --> 00:37:55.260
to have to shove everything
else away, focus on this MBA,

00:37:55.260 --> 00:37:57.718
take all my savings, toss it
into this educational program,

00:37:57.718 --> 00:38:00.215
get out with nothing-- except
a nice little piece of paper.

00:38:00.215 --> 00:38:02.090
So I renegotiated the
terms of our agreement.

00:38:02.090 --> 00:38:03.740
I ended up just doing a GMAT.

00:38:03.740 --> 00:38:06.725
And then I could still go
back to school if I needed to.

00:38:06.725 --> 00:38:10.380
It's my Plan C,
if ever I need to.

00:38:10.380 --> 00:38:13.730
And told my parents I
was going to just try

00:38:13.730 --> 00:38:15.520
to figure the
photography thing out.

00:38:15.520 --> 00:38:18.190
And so what happened when I quit
my job was that I didn't know

00:38:18.190 --> 00:38:19.860
what I wanted to do, because
there's no three year plan,

00:38:19.860 --> 00:38:20.936
there was no five year
plan, there was no studio,

00:38:20.936 --> 00:38:23.360
there was nothing, so
I decided to go travel.

00:38:23.360 --> 00:38:25.420
So when I traveled,
the first thing I did

00:38:25.420 --> 00:38:26.879
was travel to the
most exotic place

00:38:26.879 --> 00:38:29.128
that I could afford to go
to, that I knew somebody at.

00:38:29.128 --> 00:38:30.340
That happened to be Israel.

00:38:30.340 --> 00:38:32.120
So I crash on this guy's sofa.

00:38:32.120 --> 00:38:33.985
And his name is Udi.

00:38:33.985 --> 00:38:35.610
He owned a blog called
DIY Photography,

00:38:35.610 --> 00:38:36.770
and it was the first
time that I actually

00:38:36.770 --> 00:38:38.590
met somebody that
lived off the internet.

00:38:38.590 --> 00:38:42.350
He had a job at Texas
Instruments Systems engineer.

00:38:42.350 --> 00:38:44.600
And he was earning more money
from his blog part time,

00:38:44.600 --> 00:38:46.725
so he decided to quit
and do that full time.

00:38:46.725 --> 00:38:48.850
And I was like, oh hey,
this is pretty interesting.

00:38:48.850 --> 00:38:49.360
How do you do it?

00:38:49.360 --> 00:38:50.500
He was like, well, you
need to have a blog.

00:38:50.500 --> 00:38:51.290
I'm like, oh.

00:38:51.290 --> 00:38:52.831
You've got to have
a YouTube channel.

00:38:52.831 --> 00:38:53.390
I'm like, oh.

00:38:53.390 --> 00:38:55.240
So I just started
realizing all these things

00:38:55.240 --> 00:38:57.900
that I needed in order
to keep progressing,

00:38:57.900 --> 00:39:00.300
at least to transform something
into sustainable business

00:39:00.300 --> 00:39:02.120
model.

00:39:02.120 --> 00:39:04.536
So I finish that trip, I came
back home, and it was great,

00:39:04.536 --> 00:39:06.190
and I was like, OK, I
want to keep traveling.

00:39:06.190 --> 00:39:06.640
But I had a problem.

00:39:06.640 --> 00:39:07.910
I didn't have any money.

00:39:07.910 --> 00:39:09.320
So what did I do?

00:39:09.320 --> 00:39:11.380
Well, I decided to ask
people for money instead.

00:39:11.380 --> 00:39:11.970
Right?

00:39:11.970 --> 00:39:14.250
So I did a crowdfunding project.

00:39:14.250 --> 00:39:16.700
By this time, I already had
a pretty decent influence

00:39:16.700 --> 00:39:17.500
on the internet.

00:39:17.500 --> 00:39:19.000
I'd done my
behind-the-scene videos,

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:20.530
I had been teaching
people for free.

00:39:20.530 --> 00:39:21.840
I didn't have a
blog to consolidate

00:39:21.840 --> 00:39:23.590
all the information,
but it was out there.

00:39:23.590 --> 00:39:25.910
And I reached out,
and I asked people

00:39:25.910 --> 00:39:30.040
if they would support this tour
of mine to go through Europe.

00:39:30.040 --> 00:39:32.840
And surprisingly, I
put up a 5,000 thing,

00:39:32.840 --> 00:39:37.860
and I got $12,000 back
in return of people

00:39:37.860 --> 00:39:40.640
that believed in me enough
to support these projects.

00:39:40.640 --> 00:39:42.130
And then I went on this trip.

00:39:42.130 --> 00:39:43.588
And then suddenly
I went from being

00:39:43.588 --> 00:39:45.320
a Montreal-based
photographer to being

00:39:45.320 --> 00:39:48.220
a guy who had photos of
pyrotechnicians off in France.

00:39:48.220 --> 00:39:51.170
I had some mask
designers off in Spain.

00:39:51.170 --> 00:39:53.870
This shot-- that
was done in London.

00:39:53.870 --> 00:39:55.760
I have this one in Belgium.

00:39:55.760 --> 00:39:59.230
This was the National Slovak
Theater off in Slovakia.

00:39:59.230 --> 00:40:03.860
This shot of a paraplegic
Olympic athlete off in England

00:40:03.860 --> 00:40:05.130
also.

00:40:05.130 --> 00:40:08.890
And I have this shoot over
here of a band off in Belgium.

00:40:08.890 --> 00:40:10.982
So now by default,
it didn't matter

00:40:10.982 --> 00:40:12.690
that I wasn't paid
for any of this stuff.

00:40:12.690 --> 00:40:16.690
I just suddenly became this
international photographer.

00:40:16.690 --> 00:40:20.540
And then these stories all
gave me that cohesive storyline

00:40:20.540 --> 00:40:22.040
to start building
a YouTube channel,

00:40:22.040 --> 00:40:24.847
to start consolidating all of
my viewership, all of my fans.

00:40:24.847 --> 00:40:26.430
It also give an
excuse to make a blog,

00:40:26.430 --> 00:40:28.050
because I had something
to talk about.

00:40:28.050 --> 00:40:29.510
The biggest problem with
a blog is figuring out

00:40:29.510 --> 00:40:30.840
what you want to talk about.

00:40:30.840 --> 00:40:32.450
And it just really,
really started

00:40:32.450 --> 00:40:33.866
bringing the whole
thing together.

00:40:33.866 --> 00:40:36.730
So that was really what
2012 was about for me.

00:40:36.730 --> 00:40:39.620
And I fall into 2013, and I
had reached this really, really

00:40:39.620 --> 00:40:41.920
interesting point in my
life, where by that time

00:40:41.920 --> 00:40:46.814
I had 29,000 fans on Facebook,
16,000 subscribers on YouTube,

00:40:46.814 --> 00:40:48.230
30,000 monthly
views on my blog, I

00:40:48.230 --> 00:40:49.980
was doing international
workshops and conferences,

00:40:49.980 --> 00:40:52.021
and I was traveling about
six months of the year.

00:40:52.021 --> 00:40:53.657
And you're like,
all right, well,

00:40:53.657 --> 00:40:54.740
where do you go from here?

00:40:54.740 --> 00:40:56.290
On top of that, I had
actually collaborated

00:40:56.290 --> 00:40:57.470
with a whole bunch of
different companies.

00:40:57.470 --> 00:40:58.930
I'd been published in all
sorts of different places.

00:40:58.930 --> 00:41:01.760
And I was like, I don't
really know what else to do.

00:41:01.760 --> 00:41:03.800
I want more
commercial contracts,

00:41:03.800 --> 00:41:06.270
but you can't just make your
own commercial contracts.

00:41:06.270 --> 00:41:07.510
Someone needs to hire you.

00:41:07.510 --> 00:41:09.490
And in my case, I
didn't want to start

00:41:09.490 --> 00:41:12.430
bending who I was to start
attracting these clients.

00:41:12.430 --> 00:41:15.010
And I was stuck in this
rut of not really knowing

00:41:15.010 --> 00:41:17.190
where I wanted to go
from that point forward.

00:41:17.190 --> 00:41:21.150
And it just so happens
that, because I was just

00:41:21.150 --> 00:41:23.990
waiting for something
to happen, I guess,

00:41:23.990 --> 00:41:26.540
this girl by the name of
Nicole writes an email

00:41:26.540 --> 00:41:28.700
to my agent out of nowhere.

00:41:28.700 --> 00:41:30.720
Basically it's this
50-year-old lady

00:41:30.720 --> 00:41:33.172
who is diagnosed with
a terminal illness.

00:41:33.172 --> 00:41:35.130
And she'd never done a
photo shoot in her life,

00:41:35.130 --> 00:41:38.690
and she really wanted to do
a creative photo shoot that

00:41:38.690 --> 00:41:40.887
would represent who she
was so that at her funeral,

00:41:40.887 --> 00:41:43.220
she would have a photo that
she had chosen, that she had

00:41:43.220 --> 00:41:45.370
designed, to
showcase who she was.

00:41:45.370 --> 00:41:48.980
So my agent forwarded me
this email, and I saw it,

00:41:48.980 --> 00:41:49.970
and I said, hey, yeah.

00:41:49.970 --> 00:41:50.650
Definitely.

00:41:50.650 --> 00:41:51.270
Let's do this.

00:41:51.270 --> 00:41:53.669
So I gave her a
call that same day.

00:41:53.669 --> 00:41:55.210
She wasn't even
expecting a response,

00:41:55.210 --> 00:41:57.317
and it was absolutely
crazy for her.

00:41:57.317 --> 00:41:58.650
And we took her on an adventure.

00:41:58.650 --> 00:42:01.900
We took her out to do photos.

00:42:01.900 --> 00:42:04.381
We got bookshelves-- we
went to Salvation Army,

00:42:04.381 --> 00:42:05.880
got bookshelves,
books, typewriters.

00:42:05.880 --> 00:42:06.590
We found a tree.

00:42:06.590 --> 00:42:08.173
I went and took her
location scouting.

00:42:08.173 --> 00:42:10.430
Found hair, makeup,
the whole nine yards

00:42:10.430 --> 00:42:12.290
organized within
a two week period.

00:42:12.290 --> 00:42:14.790
And took for her
some crazy images

00:42:14.790 --> 00:42:18.010
that she just never really
had the chance to have before.

00:42:18.010 --> 00:42:20.840
And what was absolutely
crazy about this experience

00:42:20.840 --> 00:42:23.267
is that my photos up
to now had really just

00:42:23.267 --> 00:42:24.850
been about doing
these cool adventures

00:42:24.850 --> 00:42:26.910
that I would share with people.

00:42:26.910 --> 00:42:29.030
But they had never
really touched

00:42:29.030 --> 00:42:31.719
someone-- touched them before.

00:42:31.719 --> 00:42:33.260
Like, the photos
themselves had never

00:42:33.260 --> 00:42:35.550
really mattered
to an individual.

00:42:35.550 --> 00:42:38.270
So for me, to have images
that really meant something

00:42:38.270 --> 00:42:41.200
to somebody was really, really,
really, really crazy for me.

00:42:41.200 --> 00:42:43.020
And that really got me thinking.

00:42:43.020 --> 00:42:43.900
And I told myself,
you know what?

00:42:43.900 --> 00:42:45.733
I really need to do
more projects like this.

00:42:45.733 --> 00:42:47.394
This stuff is fantastic.

00:42:47.394 --> 00:42:49.310
But you now, you can't
really wait for someone

00:42:49.310 --> 00:42:51.260
to send you a message saying
that they're terminally ill

00:42:51.260 --> 00:42:52.370
and they need photos.

00:42:52.370 --> 00:42:54.880
So I decided to reach out to
the Make-a-Wish Foundation.

00:42:54.880 --> 00:42:57.087
I tried Make-a-Wish USA, I
tried Make-a-Wish Canada.

00:42:57.087 --> 00:42:58.920
I reached out to them,
told them what I did,

00:42:58.920 --> 00:43:01.150
and that I'd love
to get involved.

00:43:01.150 --> 00:43:02.130
And we talked.

00:43:02.130 --> 00:43:03.630
It went great, and
nothing happened.

00:43:03.630 --> 00:43:07.529
So I just ended up
in this situation

00:43:07.529 --> 00:43:10.070
where my mind frame was set on
doing more products like this.

00:43:10.070 --> 00:43:11.690
I didn't know how they
were going to come about,

00:43:11.690 --> 00:43:13.231
but I was kind of
working towards it.

00:43:13.231 --> 00:43:15.755
And that's where the idea
of going to visit Tyler off

00:43:15.755 --> 00:43:17.260
in Australia came forth.

00:43:17.260 --> 00:43:18.870
And additionally,
there's this project

00:43:18.870 --> 00:43:21.480
that actually just
landed on my doorstep.

00:43:21.480 --> 00:43:23.290
This little girl--
I got an email

00:43:23.290 --> 00:43:25.880
from one of my contacts,
a writer at PetaPixel.

00:43:25.880 --> 00:43:28.240
So the full story is,
there's this father

00:43:28.240 --> 00:43:31.780
off in South Carolina who
has this little daughter

00:43:31.780 --> 00:43:33.410
with a degenerative
brain disease.

00:43:33.410 --> 00:43:34.320
She's four years old.

00:43:34.320 --> 00:43:36.055
And basically right
now, she's normal.

00:43:36.055 --> 00:43:38.430
She runs, she talks, she
laughs, just like any other kid.

00:43:38.430 --> 00:43:40.239
But over the next
three to four years,

00:43:40.239 --> 00:43:42.280
she's going to slowly stop
walking, stop talking,

00:43:42.280 --> 00:43:45.600
stop everything, and
just basically die

00:43:45.600 --> 00:43:47.190
around her teenage years.

00:43:47.190 --> 00:43:49.590
And there's a cure
that's available,

00:43:49.590 --> 00:43:51.350
but what's missing
right now is money

00:43:51.350 --> 00:43:52.710
to fund the clinical trial.

00:43:52.710 --> 00:43:57.770
And he had Googled online
"how to make a viral video,"

00:43:57.770 --> 00:43:59.510
because at that
point they had raised

00:43:59.510 --> 00:44:02.385
$43,000 on their GoFundMe
campaign after nine months,

00:44:02.385 --> 00:44:04.010
and they didn't really
know what to do.

00:44:04.010 --> 00:44:07.240
And they had three
months left to raise

00:44:07.240 --> 00:44:10.000
the next-- what
was it-- $950,000.

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:11.875
And had no idea how they
were going to do it.

00:44:11.875 --> 00:44:13.569
So they went to Google.

00:44:13.569 --> 00:44:15.360
They searched, they
ended up on the website

00:44:15.360 --> 00:44:18.794
of some girl called Karen Chang,
who had written an article "How

00:44:18.794 --> 00:44:20.210
to Make a Viral
Video-- 10 steps."

00:44:20.210 --> 00:44:21.870
And he just read it
and he was like, this

00:44:21.870 --> 00:44:22.730
doesn't mean anything to me.

00:44:22.730 --> 00:44:23.430
I can't do this.

00:44:23.430 --> 00:44:26.010
I'm just a normal guy
trying to help my daughter.

00:44:26.010 --> 00:44:28.420
And he writes her an email
saying, hey, I need help.

00:44:28.420 --> 00:44:32.100
She had seen my video that
I had made for Nicole,

00:44:32.100 --> 00:44:34.320
so she reached out to the
editor of the blogger that

00:44:34.320 --> 00:44:36.640
had featured me, saying, do
you know any videographers

00:44:36.640 --> 00:44:38.440
that might be interested
in participating?

00:44:38.440 --> 00:44:40.430
He sent an email out
to a bunch of people.

00:44:40.430 --> 00:44:42.555
And I got this email between
Singapore and Malaysia

00:44:42.555 --> 00:44:43.550
on my phone.

00:44:43.550 --> 00:44:47.734
And I was sitting on the plane
just getting ready to take off.

00:44:47.734 --> 00:44:49.525
They said, well, we
need a million dollars.

00:44:49.525 --> 00:44:50.610
We need a viral video.

00:44:50.610 --> 00:44:51.860
We have three months to do it.

00:44:51.860 --> 00:44:54.280
And I was like, seems
like a hard project.

00:44:54.280 --> 00:44:55.260
I'm down.

00:44:55.260 --> 00:45:00.210
So I wrote back a message, and
I said-- within 10 minutes,

00:45:00.210 --> 00:45:02.660
I wrote back and I said, I'm
not the best videographer

00:45:02.660 --> 00:45:02.890
out there.

00:45:02.890 --> 00:45:04.431
Actually, I'm more
of a photographer.

00:45:04.431 --> 00:45:06.280
But if you guys are
willing to have me,

00:45:06.280 --> 00:45:08.940
I have 10 days free next month.

00:45:08.940 --> 00:45:12.140
I'll fly myself over, and
help you guys make a video.

00:45:12.140 --> 00:45:14.890
And there's only two people
that replied to that email--

00:45:14.890 --> 00:45:17.880
and it was sent out to 50,
100 people-- and that was me

00:45:17.880 --> 00:45:20.330
and SmugMug that replied three
days later, which I thought

00:45:20.330 --> 00:45:21.890
was absolutely crazy.

00:45:21.890 --> 00:45:26.670
So this entire
project went along.

00:45:26.670 --> 00:45:29.890
I flew myself over,
helped to make a video so

00:45:29.890 --> 00:45:31.720
that their little
girl wouldn't end up

00:45:31.720 --> 00:45:33.960
looking like the
other one on the side.

00:45:33.960 --> 00:45:37.627
And the video-- I'd like
to play it really quickly.

00:45:37.627 --> 00:45:41.300
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:45:41.300 --> 00:45:45.750
-Cara always wanted a daughter.

00:45:45.750 --> 00:45:51.340
We'd a couple miscarriages,
and finally, we get very lucky

00:45:51.340 --> 00:45:52.548
and have Eliza.

00:45:52.548 --> 00:45:59.280
-I would describe Eliza as
a very affectionate child.

00:45:59.280 --> 00:46:02.470
Happy, very active,
and the little girl

00:46:02.470 --> 00:46:04.390
that kind of keeps
you on your toes.

00:46:04.390 --> 00:46:08.340
-It was just great for two
and a half, three years.

00:46:08.340 --> 00:46:11.710
I would say we had the
perfect-- just the perfect life.

00:46:17.460 --> 00:46:21.294
I didn't go to the meeting when
the diagnosis was received.

00:46:21.294 --> 00:46:22.210
I wasn't even at that.

00:46:22.210 --> 00:46:24.240
It was another just
check it off the list

00:46:24.240 --> 00:46:26.281
to make sure that this
isn't what-- I didn't even

00:46:26.281 --> 00:46:27.660
know what the meeting was.

00:46:27.660 --> 00:46:29.870
I didn't even there was a
genetics meeting happening,

00:46:29.870 --> 00:46:30.440
honestly.

00:46:30.440 --> 00:46:33.399
-And they just
said, you know, I'm

00:46:33.399 --> 00:46:34.690
not gonna beat around the bush.

00:46:34.690 --> 00:46:36.230
I'll just tell you like it is.

00:46:36.230 --> 00:46:38.810
She's got Sanfilippo Syndrome.

00:46:38.810 --> 00:46:42.090
And having heard
about the syndrome

00:46:42.090 --> 00:46:44.550
before through my
medical training, I mean,

00:46:44.550 --> 00:46:47.650
I just-- that sinking,
pit of your stomach,

00:46:47.650 --> 00:46:50.665
like this is really bad.

00:46:50.665 --> 00:46:52.274
This is a really bad.

00:46:52.274 --> 00:46:53.440
-You know where it's headed.

00:46:53.440 --> 00:46:55.630
It's headed towards suffering.

00:46:55.630 --> 00:46:57.740
It's headed towards
pain for her.

00:46:57.740 --> 00:47:02.910
And as a father, you want to be
able to protect your children.

00:47:10.420 --> 00:47:12.270
-If the money
doesn't come in time,

00:47:12.270 --> 00:47:15.440
she'll stop speaking
within the next six months.

00:47:15.440 --> 00:47:20.410
She will stop walking
withing the next two years.

00:47:20.410 --> 00:47:23.370
Stop being able to feed
herself in the next three

00:47:23.370 --> 00:47:24.300
to four years.

00:47:24.300 --> 00:47:27.910
She will develop seizures
and movement disorders,

00:47:27.910 --> 00:47:31.120
experience a lot of
pain and suffering.

00:47:31.120 --> 00:47:33.820
And then she'll die.

00:47:33.820 --> 00:47:35.930
-The donations that
come in are going

00:47:35.930 --> 00:47:39.230
to fund this clinical
trial, and fund

00:47:39.230 --> 00:47:40.720
a chance at life for Eliza.

00:47:40.720 --> 00:47:43.780
I mean that is the
hope we hold onto.

00:47:43.780 --> 00:47:47.680
-Hope is a nice word,
but we need action.

00:47:47.680 --> 00:47:48.830
We don't just have hope.

00:47:48.830 --> 00:47:51.080
There is something
very real that

00:47:51.080 --> 00:47:55.600
exists that, with enough
money, will happen,

00:47:55.600 --> 00:47:59.710
and will happen in time for
our Eliza and other kids.

00:47:59.710 --> 00:48:00.810
-I mean, it is so close.

00:48:00.810 --> 00:48:03.534
We're just so close to
this being done, and being

00:48:03.534 --> 00:48:04.200
put in children.

00:48:04.200 --> 00:48:05.880
It's going to be hit or miss.

00:48:05.880 --> 00:48:10.430
-It's not a question of, you
know, if this can happen.

00:48:10.430 --> 00:48:11.776
This will happen.

00:48:14.394 --> 00:48:16.120
-Please share.

00:48:16.120 --> 00:48:17.058
Please share.

00:48:19.872 --> 00:48:21.280
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:48:21.280 --> 00:48:23.270
BEN VON WONG: So coming
up with a video that

00:48:23.270 --> 00:48:25.900
was able to explain this
really complicated syndrome

00:48:25.900 --> 00:48:27.430
within a three
minute period to hold

00:48:27.430 --> 00:48:30.880
the attention of the internet
was a huge challenge.

00:48:30.880 --> 00:48:33.150
And actually, putting
together this interview

00:48:33.150 --> 00:48:35.510
was really, really stressful,
because you're there,

00:48:35.510 --> 00:48:38.120
listening to these interviews,
over and over, of the two

00:48:38.120 --> 00:48:40.620
parents just talking about
how hard it was for them

00:48:40.620 --> 00:48:43.720
to learn this news,
over and over.

00:48:43.720 --> 00:48:46.030
And knowing that the
results of these videos

00:48:46.030 --> 00:48:49.132
were directly going to
impact the life of this child

00:48:49.132 --> 00:48:51.340
wasn't really something I
had considered at the time.

00:48:51.340 --> 00:48:52.500
I just thought it was going
to be a cool challenge,

00:48:52.500 --> 00:48:54.360
and then I realized
after that, I

00:48:54.360 --> 00:48:59.770
was literally like that
this video represented

00:48:59.770 --> 00:49:02.200
the one hope they had
of actually successfully

00:49:02.200 --> 00:49:04.850
or unsuccessfully funding
the entire project.

00:49:04.850 --> 00:49:06.430
And thankfully
the video actually

00:49:06.430 --> 00:49:08.280
picked up quite nicely.

00:49:08.280 --> 00:49:13.210
And within a three month period,
we had actually hit $1 million.

00:49:15.860 --> 00:49:17.945
And right now, they're
off and their campaign's

00:49:17.945 --> 00:49:18.570
still going on.

00:49:18.570 --> 00:49:22.320
They have another
$800,000 to go.

00:49:22.320 --> 00:49:24.490
But now the deadline's been
push back up to October.

00:49:24.490 --> 00:49:26.200
And it's this really
crazy situation

00:49:26.200 --> 00:49:27.990
where they're doing
all of this work,

00:49:27.990 --> 00:49:29.750
they're trying to raise
all of this money,

00:49:29.750 --> 00:49:31.500
and they don't even
know if their child is

00:49:31.500 --> 00:49:34.130
going to be selected
for the trial.

00:49:34.130 --> 00:49:37.207
So this really this chance to
cure this incurable disease

00:49:37.207 --> 00:49:39.290
that everyone's been putting
a lot of effort into.

00:49:39.290 --> 00:49:40.840
And it's just
really magical to be

00:49:40.840 --> 00:49:42.575
a part of a process
like this, and being

00:49:42.575 --> 00:49:44.700
able to leverage social
media and all this content,

00:49:44.700 --> 00:49:48.767
and all these things that I've
done over my career, I suppose,

00:49:48.767 --> 00:49:49.850
has been absolutely crazy.

00:49:49.850 --> 00:49:53.270
I launched a site with
SmugMug, just photographers

00:49:53.270 --> 00:49:56.107
donating their prints to sell
their prints to their fans

00:49:56.107 --> 00:49:56.690
and followers.

00:49:56.690 --> 00:49:59.930
And we've managed to raise
$28,000 through that alone.

00:49:59.930 --> 00:50:02.320
So there's all these
different-- I don't know,

00:50:02.320 --> 00:50:04.210
the internet is
this amazing place.

00:50:04.210 --> 00:50:06.620
And photography isn't just
limited to taking pictures,

00:50:06.620 --> 00:50:07.910
but it is so much
larger than that.

00:50:07.910 --> 00:50:09.670
It is something that you can
reach out and connect people

00:50:09.670 --> 00:50:10.540
to.

00:50:10.540 --> 00:50:12.959
And it's been really, really
amazing to see all of this,

00:50:12.959 --> 00:50:14.375
and it's something
that, you know,

00:50:14.375 --> 00:50:16.995
I decided that I really want to
start being more of a part of.

00:50:16.995 --> 00:50:19.620
So if we were to break down the
different phases in photography

00:50:19.620 --> 00:50:22.780
in my career, we have 2008,
which is about learning.

00:50:22.780 --> 00:50:25.520
We have 2010, which is
about sharing, 2012,

00:50:25.520 --> 00:50:28.476
which is about dreaming, and
2013, which is about evolving.

00:50:28.476 --> 00:50:29.850
And these are
really four phases,

00:50:29.850 --> 00:50:32.400
I think, in a person's
career that-- these

00:50:32.400 --> 00:50:34.460
are things that are
always going to come back.

00:50:34.460 --> 00:50:35.480
You never want to stop learning.

00:50:35.480 --> 00:50:36.910
You never want to stop sharing.

00:50:36.910 --> 00:50:37.620
You never want to stop dreaming.

00:50:37.620 --> 00:50:39.161
And you always want
to keep evolving,

00:50:39.161 --> 00:50:40.870
because things change as you go.

00:50:40.870 --> 00:50:42.670
And if you spend too
long going on a path

00:50:42.670 --> 00:50:44.480
and start questioning
why you're doing it,

00:50:44.480 --> 00:50:47.280
it's time to re-evaluate
why you're doing everything,

00:50:47.280 --> 00:50:49.350
and figure out where you
want to go from there.

00:50:49.350 --> 00:50:51.050
So questions?

00:50:54.806 --> 00:50:56.200
You guys are all sleeping.

00:50:56.200 --> 00:50:56.700
One!

00:50:56.700 --> 00:50:58.699
AUDIENCE: What
happened to the child?

00:50:58.699 --> 00:51:00.990
BEN VON WONG: Well, she's--
what happened to the child?

00:51:03.520 --> 00:51:05.200
She's still there.

00:51:05.200 --> 00:51:07.830
Right now, they've been
featured on everything,

00:51:07.830 --> 00:51:09.370
from NBC to the Today Show.

00:51:09.370 --> 00:51:12.740
It's gone around, and
now we're still waiting.

00:51:12.740 --> 00:51:14.980
I just did this
three months ago.

00:51:14.980 --> 00:51:18.450
This is current right now,
and the question is, will they

00:51:18.450 --> 00:51:20.312
make enough money
for October, and then

00:51:20.312 --> 00:51:21.770
the next question
is, will she even

00:51:21.770 --> 00:51:25.670
be selected, which is
outside of our control.

00:51:25.670 --> 00:51:27.870
Actually, you can
use the microphone.

00:51:27.870 --> 00:51:30.410
AUDIENCE: You said that
you were considering

00:51:30.410 --> 00:51:33.410
doing works like the
one you described,

00:51:33.410 --> 00:51:37.060
and like the one, the video.

00:51:37.060 --> 00:51:43.890
So are you managing
to sell these projects

00:51:43.890 --> 00:51:47.520
and to make money out of
it, out of these people?

00:51:47.520 --> 00:51:49.599
Are you getting
progress in that?

00:51:49.599 --> 00:51:51.140
BEN VON WONG: Well,
I do occasionally

00:51:51.140 --> 00:51:54.510
get hired to take photos from
time to time, which is great.

00:51:54.510 --> 00:51:57.590
I can't say that I have been the
pinnacle of commercial success,

00:51:57.590 --> 00:52:00.090
but it also hasn't been
what has driven me.

00:52:00.090 --> 00:52:02.070
If anything, what's
driving me is the idea

00:52:02.070 --> 00:52:04.280
to create content that
is social media friendly

00:52:04.280 --> 00:52:07.460
that will get my name
out there, because I

00:52:07.460 --> 00:52:09.360
think the money will
come, sooner or later.

00:52:09.360 --> 00:52:12.215
And right now I'm in the stage
where I'm travelling eight,

00:52:12.215 --> 00:52:13.850
ten months out of the year.

00:52:13.850 --> 00:52:16.070
I'm meeting people
all over the place.

00:52:16.070 --> 00:52:19.540
I'm doing things that nobody's
ever done before-- I mean,

00:52:19.540 --> 00:52:22.180
I just did a shoot in
a shipwreck in Bali,

00:52:22.180 --> 00:52:25.051
25 to 30 meters
underwater-- that no one

00:52:25.051 --> 00:52:26.300
would hire me to do right now.

00:52:26.300 --> 00:52:28.520
But I can do it, and I
did it, and it's gone out,

00:52:28.520 --> 00:52:30.464
and it's gotten a
lot of attention.

00:52:30.464 --> 00:52:32.880
And all these things, all these
projects that I'm building

00:52:32.880 --> 00:52:35.670
will build up eventually
to a commercial career.

00:52:35.670 --> 00:52:38.045
But once I get there, and I
have a house and I have a car

00:52:38.045 --> 00:52:40.003
and I have a studio, I
can't be crazy any more.

00:52:40.003 --> 00:52:40.990
I can't go around.

00:52:40.990 --> 00:52:43.450
So I'm not really in any
rush to get to that point.

00:52:43.450 --> 00:52:47.320
And I do have an agent, and
she's there to make sure

00:52:47.320 --> 00:52:49.154
that all the pieces
are lined up properly.

00:52:49.154 --> 00:52:50.820
I have a bunch of
corporate sponsorships

00:52:50.820 --> 00:52:54.050
of people who give me
equipment, support what I do,

00:52:54.050 --> 00:52:57.570
and enable me to
keep going forward.

00:52:57.570 --> 00:52:59.070
So all the pieces are in place.

00:52:59.070 --> 00:53:00.922
When the commercial
gigs come in, I do them,

00:53:00.922 --> 00:53:01.630
and they're fine.

00:53:01.630 --> 00:53:03.260
But it's not the
focus right now.

00:53:03.260 --> 00:53:05.900
Right now, my focus has
really been creating things,

00:53:05.900 --> 00:53:08.300
doing things that I love,
getting out there, and making

00:53:08.300 --> 00:53:10.880
awesome stuff.

00:53:10.880 --> 00:53:13.625
AUDIENCE: So one thing I've
picked up through everything

00:53:13.625 --> 00:53:16.960
that you said is that pretty
much everything you've done

00:53:16.960 --> 00:53:19.930
is with the involvement,
with the help,

00:53:19.930 --> 00:53:21.790
with the input of other people.

00:53:21.790 --> 00:53:23.520
And in particular,
it sounds like a lot

00:53:23.520 --> 00:53:25.530
of that has been
from social media,

00:53:25.530 --> 00:53:29.420
like social media is
the be all, the end all,

00:53:29.420 --> 00:53:32.010
the end unto itself
kind of thing.

00:53:32.010 --> 00:53:36.390
I'm wondering if that's
a fair assessment,

00:53:36.390 --> 00:53:39.210
if I'm picking up things
correctly from you.

00:53:39.210 --> 00:53:41.644
If you started out
basically establishing

00:53:41.644 --> 00:53:44.060
your online presence, and it
just kind of went from there,

00:53:44.060 --> 00:53:46.780
or if there's been
more to it than that,

00:53:46.780 --> 00:53:50.250
if there's been a little bit
more of traditional outreach,

00:53:50.250 --> 00:53:51.070
so to speak.

00:53:51.070 --> 00:53:52.450
BEN VON WONG: I think
growing up as a kid,

00:53:52.450 --> 00:53:54.449
I've always been somewhat
of an attention whore.

00:53:57.340 --> 00:53:59.115
Yeah-- do I keep talking?

00:53:59.115 --> 00:53:59.990
AUDIENCE: Yeah, yeah.

00:53:59.990 --> 00:54:00.450
BEN VON WONG: Oh, OK.

00:54:00.450 --> 00:54:01.660
Yeah, so growing up,
I've always been somewhat

00:54:01.660 --> 00:54:02.907
of an attention whore.

00:54:02.907 --> 00:54:04.990
And then I've never been
really great at anything.

00:54:04.990 --> 00:54:07.420
I've done a whole bunch of
things-- I've played violin,

00:54:07.420 --> 00:54:09.840
I've done martial arts, I've
done dancing and everything--

00:54:09.840 --> 00:54:11.000
but I've never been
great at anything.

00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:12.030
I've never been really
good at anything.

00:54:12.030 --> 00:54:13.488
And then suddenly
with photography,

00:54:13.488 --> 00:54:15.729
I started being
half-decent at something

00:54:15.729 --> 00:54:17.770
that I could then share
with people, that I would

00:54:17.770 --> 00:54:19.170
get some great
feedback from, and I

00:54:19.170 --> 00:54:20.294
could interact with people.

00:54:20.294 --> 00:54:22.850
So I think social media-- like
without social media, if we're

00:54:22.850 --> 00:54:24.892
still on film, I probably
wouldn't take pictures.

00:54:24.892 --> 00:54:26.766
I don't have the patience
to go in a darkroom

00:54:26.766 --> 00:54:29.100
and lock myself in a hole
and come up with pictures

00:54:29.100 --> 00:54:30.760
that a couple people
are going to see.

00:54:30.760 --> 00:54:33.024
So I wouldn't be able to
do the projects that I do,

00:54:33.024 --> 00:54:34.940
I wouldn't be able to
travel the way I travel,

00:54:34.940 --> 00:54:36.150
I wouldn't be able to meet
the people I would meet.

00:54:36.150 --> 00:54:38.380
So yeah, I think that's
definitely a fair assessment

00:54:38.380 --> 00:54:41.220
to say that internet's
changed the world.

00:54:41.220 --> 00:54:42.620
It's shaped my world.

00:54:42.620 --> 00:54:47.860
AUDIENCE: In the movies, we have
a director, and we have a DP.

00:54:47.860 --> 00:54:48.780
You don't.

00:54:48.780 --> 00:54:51.070
You're directing and
doing photography?

00:54:51.070 --> 00:54:55.600
How do you manage such
a large crew and actors,

00:54:55.600 --> 00:55:00.100
many times as those actors are
models are not professional,

00:55:00.100 --> 00:55:03.070
so they're even more
demanding to work with

00:55:03.070 --> 00:55:05.519
and to try to get
your vision out of?

00:55:05.519 --> 00:55:07.560
BEN VON WONG: I think the
answer to that question

00:55:07.560 --> 00:55:09.990
is there's not really
any good answer to it.

00:55:09.990 --> 00:55:11.970
The answer is I just do it.

00:55:11.970 --> 00:55:16.100
At the end of the day,
I don't have a team.

00:55:16.100 --> 00:55:18.340
I source my team of
freelancers whenever

00:55:18.340 --> 00:55:21.470
it's needed, the idea being
that if you need someone,

00:55:21.470 --> 00:55:22.730
you just reach out to them.

00:55:22.730 --> 00:55:25.150
And of course, I think
my greatest strength

00:55:25.150 --> 00:55:27.327
as an individual is not my
ability to take pictures,

00:55:27.327 --> 00:55:28.910
but my ability to
connect with people.

00:55:28.910 --> 00:55:30.243
I'm a really good people person.

00:55:30.243 --> 00:55:32.327
I'm sociable, I'm happy,
I'm energetic, I animate,

00:55:32.327 --> 00:55:33.784
I bring people
together, and I make

00:55:33.784 --> 00:55:35.580
them believe that
they can do anything,

00:55:35.580 --> 00:55:36.840
and then together we do stuff.

00:55:36.840 --> 00:55:39.630
But I'm just a guy
pressing the button.

00:55:39.630 --> 00:55:41.380
If I couldn't bring
these people together,

00:55:41.380 --> 00:55:43.940
I wouldn't have
anything to work with.

00:55:43.940 --> 00:55:46.494
And incidentally, yes, I take
pictures, technically speaking,

00:55:46.494 --> 00:55:47.910
putting lights up,
all that stuff.

00:55:47.910 --> 00:55:49.330
That's kind of secondary.

00:55:49.330 --> 00:55:52.830
But my projects, my productions,
bringing these elements

00:55:52.830 --> 00:55:54.540
together-- there's so
much pre-production

00:55:54.540 --> 00:55:55.772
that comes into it.

00:55:55.772 --> 00:55:58.230
I don't know, I guess it's the
excitement that just carries

00:55:58.230 --> 00:55:59.635
through that vision, the idea.

00:55:59.635 --> 00:56:02.260
Sharing with people and telling
them that anything is possible,

00:56:02.260 --> 00:56:04.990
that they can do it, is
a huge part of what I do.

00:56:04.990 --> 00:56:08.520
So I don't really know how
to answer your question "how

00:56:08.520 --> 00:56:09.230
do you do it."

00:56:09.230 --> 00:56:11.042
I just do it.

00:56:11.042 --> 00:56:12.750
AUDIENCE: So apparently
from your photos,

00:56:12.750 --> 00:56:15.530
it seems like there's a lot of
technical aspects associated

00:56:15.530 --> 00:56:20.010
with them to be able to fully
realize the creativity that

00:56:20.010 --> 00:56:21.590
is in your head.

00:56:21.590 --> 00:56:23.880
How much of the
engineering background

00:56:23.880 --> 00:56:28.150
that you had actually carried
through into the photography

00:56:28.150 --> 00:56:33.030
world, or did you have to
basically start from scratch?

00:56:33.030 --> 00:56:35.580
BEN VON WONG: You know, I
think every single experience

00:56:35.580 --> 00:56:39.670
in your life is a
byproduct that contributes

00:56:39.670 --> 00:56:41.320
to whatever you happen to do.

00:56:41.320 --> 00:56:43.040
So the fact that
I traveled a lot

00:56:43.040 --> 00:56:44.970
when I was younger-- I've been
in 13 different schools, three

00:56:44.970 --> 00:56:45.980
different countries,
different languages,

00:56:45.980 --> 00:56:48.130
means I can connect
to people very well.

00:56:48.130 --> 00:56:50.505
The fact that I did 15
years of martial arts

00:56:50.505 --> 00:56:51.880
means that I
understand movement.

00:56:51.880 --> 00:56:52.650
I'm able to capture that.

00:56:52.650 --> 00:56:53.420
I know what the peaks are.

00:56:53.420 --> 00:56:55.920
I know how to communicate with
an athlete so I can connect.

00:56:55.920 --> 00:56:58.670
And the fact that I had
training as an engineer

00:56:58.670 --> 00:57:01.630
means I have a critical problem
solving analytical approach

00:57:01.630 --> 00:57:02.789
to things.

00:57:02.789 --> 00:57:05.080
But that's how I choose to
sell myself, because I mean,

00:57:05.080 --> 00:57:08.100
I can just bullshit all
day long about what skills

00:57:08.100 --> 00:57:11.840
and how they've contributed
to my background.

00:57:11.840 --> 00:57:14.930
Engineering is
engineering-- I don't know.

00:57:14.930 --> 00:57:17.220
I just downloaded
AutoCAD the other day

00:57:17.220 --> 00:57:19.600
to design this rig that
we're going to be hanging off

00:57:19.600 --> 00:57:20.850
the building, which was great.

00:57:20.850 --> 00:57:23.170
I was so happy to learn that
something I did at school

00:57:23.170 --> 00:57:24.620
is actually useful now.

00:57:24.620 --> 00:57:30.290
But I can't really say that
it's something that's directly

00:57:30.290 --> 00:57:32.602
contributed, but there
are definitely benefits,

00:57:32.602 --> 00:57:34.310
just like everything
that you've learned,

00:57:34.310 --> 00:57:35.680
all the experiences
in your life,

00:57:35.680 --> 00:57:37.013
contribute to the final success.

00:57:37.013 --> 00:57:40.060
I don't think you need to be an
engineer to be a photographer.

00:57:40.060 --> 00:57:41.844
But it sure can't hurt.

00:57:41.844 --> 00:57:43.385
But I'm sure a master
physician would

00:57:43.385 --> 00:57:46.836
have just as much
to gain from it.

00:57:46.836 --> 00:57:48.210
I guess the question
from now is,

00:57:48.210 --> 00:57:49.120
how does it all come together?

00:57:49.120 --> 00:57:51.080
How do you take all of
these pieces and everything?

00:57:51.080 --> 00:57:52.329
How do they all come together?

00:57:52.329 --> 00:57:53.660
How do they fall into place?

00:57:53.660 --> 00:57:55.160
How do I make these
big productions?

00:57:55.160 --> 00:57:57.607
I've talked about how I build
up to it, but how these all

00:57:57.607 --> 00:57:58.190
come together?

00:57:58.190 --> 00:58:00.710
And I think that it's all a
question about breaking it down

00:58:00.710 --> 00:58:01.520
into smaller parts.

00:58:01.520 --> 00:58:02.690
You have these stories
that are really

00:58:02.690 --> 00:58:04.440
elaborate, that are
really large scale,

00:58:04.440 --> 00:58:05.900
but at the end of the day,
if you break them down,

00:58:05.900 --> 00:58:07.240
they're just like any
other photo shoot.

00:58:07.240 --> 00:58:08.575
You have a location, you have
a model, you have your props,

00:58:08.575 --> 00:58:10.290
you have the stylist,
you have your talent,

00:58:10.290 --> 00:58:11.998
and all these little
pieces of the puzzle

00:58:11.998 --> 00:58:13.620
working together
that you've brought

00:58:13.620 --> 00:58:16.814
together so that
there's a story to tell.

00:58:16.814 --> 00:58:18.730
And if you break these
down into little parts,

00:58:18.730 --> 00:58:20.890
then they suddenly become
a lot more manageable,

00:58:20.890 --> 00:58:25.319
because each one takes a certain
amount of work to figure out.

00:58:25.319 --> 00:58:26.860
And you figure out
there's no there's

00:58:26.860 --> 00:58:29.637
no huge magical
formula to figuring out

00:58:29.637 --> 00:58:30.470
all of these things.

00:58:30.470 --> 00:58:32.845
At the end of the day, really,
the solution is hard work.

00:58:32.845 --> 00:58:34.719
So I just have a
couple stories on how

00:58:34.719 --> 00:58:36.760
each one of these individual
elements were found.

00:58:36.760 --> 00:58:38.330
So location, for example.

00:58:38.330 --> 00:58:42.750
This was a shoot that
I did in a shipwreck

00:58:42.750 --> 00:58:45.440
on the surface of
water in Vancouver.

00:58:45.440 --> 00:58:47.399
And basically what
had happened was

00:58:47.399 --> 00:58:49.690
I was going to fly over to
Vancouver and do a workshop.

00:58:49.690 --> 00:58:52.554
But the workshop organizer was
so crappy that I flew in 8 days

00:58:52.554 --> 00:58:54.970
before the shoot, and we didn't
have a place to shoot yet.

00:58:54.970 --> 00:58:55.969
But he had sold tickets.

00:58:55.969 --> 00:58:58.314
And I was like, what
are we going to do?

00:58:58.314 --> 00:58:59.980
He's like, oh, we'll
just find a studio.

00:58:59.980 --> 00:59:01.390
And I said, I don't
shoot in studios.

00:59:01.390 --> 00:59:03.320
You can't do a workshop
with me in a studio.

00:59:03.320 --> 00:59:05.341
We need to find a
really cool place.

00:59:05.341 --> 00:59:07.340
So obviously he wasn't
going to be very helpful.

00:59:07.340 --> 00:59:09.730
And I just started
hunting online.

00:59:09.730 --> 00:59:12.860
I just went and stalked profiles
from other photographers that

00:59:12.860 --> 00:59:15.471
were based out of Vancouver
that did crazier things.

00:59:15.471 --> 00:59:17.970
So I reached out to a couple
of my friends that knew people,

00:59:17.970 --> 00:59:20.310
and someone referred me to
this guy called Pete Jones.

00:59:20.310 --> 00:59:23.910
And I was browsing his albums,
and I saw this shipwreck,

00:59:23.910 --> 00:59:25.914
and I was like this is
where we need to shoot!

00:59:25.914 --> 00:59:26.830
How do we shoot there?

00:59:26.830 --> 00:59:28.740
So I wrote him a message,
presented my case,

00:59:28.740 --> 00:59:30.280
that I was teaching,
really needed

00:59:30.280 --> 00:59:31.992
help, I'm a
photographer, da da da.

00:59:31.992 --> 00:59:33.700
And he's like, I can
give you the contact

00:59:33.700 --> 00:59:35.999
information for the guy,
but just a word of warning,

00:59:35.999 --> 00:59:36.790
he's kind of crazy.

00:59:36.790 --> 00:59:38.030
I said, I don't care.

00:59:38.030 --> 00:59:39.120
I want to shoot there.

00:59:39.120 --> 00:59:40.490
So he gives me this number.

00:59:40.490 --> 00:59:42.560
I call up the guy and I
tell him I want to shoot.

00:59:42.560 --> 00:59:44.910
And he comes up with this
whole conspiracy theory

00:59:44.910 --> 00:59:47.790
on why it's not OK to shoot
there because the government is

00:59:47.790 --> 00:59:50.260
chasing after his land and some
illegal things and whatnot.

00:59:50.260 --> 00:59:52.070
They'll shut them down.

00:59:52.070 --> 00:59:53.740
And then he kept
talking, and then he

00:59:53.740 --> 00:59:55.130
started rambling about
what the difference

00:59:55.130 --> 00:59:56.840
between a Chinese person
was, a Korean person,

00:59:56.840 --> 00:59:57.590
a Japanese person.

00:59:57.590 --> 00:59:59.390
That conversation
lasted about an hour.

00:59:59.390 --> 01:00:00.490
Didn't go anywhere.

01:00:00.490 --> 01:00:01.330
But I didn't hang up the phone.

01:00:01.330 --> 01:00:02.538
I just kept listening to him.

01:00:02.538 --> 01:00:04.925
And then eventually
he said, well, I

01:00:04.925 --> 01:00:07.300
can't let you shoot there,
but do you want to come visit?

01:00:07.300 --> 01:00:10.070
And I said, yes, that's
exactly what I was waiting for.

01:00:10.070 --> 01:00:11.510
So 8 o'clock the
next morning, we

01:00:11.510 --> 01:00:13.593
drove down-- or actually
6 o'clock in the morning.

01:00:13.593 --> 01:00:16.790
We drove down to meet him at
8 o'clock and say, oh, great.

01:00:16.790 --> 01:00:17.690
Can we see the place?

01:00:17.690 --> 01:00:19.430
So he took us for a
little tour, all the while

01:00:19.430 --> 01:00:20.730
saying we couldn't shoot there.

01:00:20.730 --> 01:00:22.350
And showed us how
amazing the place

01:00:22.350 --> 01:00:24.070
was, this and that,
this and that.

01:00:24.070 --> 01:00:27.160
And then at the end, we said,
well, why can't we shoot there?

01:00:27.160 --> 01:00:30.115
And he shows us this sign by
the Agricultural Land Commission

01:00:30.115 --> 01:00:31.750
and says, look at this thing.

01:00:31.750 --> 01:00:32.810
They put a notice up.

01:00:32.810 --> 01:00:34.130
They won't let us shoot.

01:00:34.130 --> 01:00:35.206
I'm reading the sign,
and it doesn't really

01:00:35.206 --> 01:00:37.159
say anything about
film or photo permits.

01:00:37.159 --> 01:00:38.450
So there's a number at the end.

01:00:38.450 --> 01:00:41.502
We call them up and say, hey,
we're at this guy's property.

01:00:41.502 --> 01:00:43.210
Are we allowed to do
a shoot on the boat?

01:00:43.210 --> 01:00:44.815
And they said, oh, yeah.

01:00:44.815 --> 01:00:46.690
Actually the reason why
that sign is up there

01:00:46.690 --> 01:00:49.370
is because he's declared that
these lands are being used

01:00:49.370 --> 01:00:54.170
for farming purposes,
and he's got broken ships

01:00:54.170 --> 01:00:55.720
on his property
instead of farming.

01:00:55.720 --> 01:00:58.454
So it was just an excuse for a
tax break, and all this stuff.

01:00:58.454 --> 01:01:00.745
I'm like, OK, so there's no
problem for shooting there,

01:01:00.745 --> 01:01:00.890
right?

01:01:00.890 --> 01:01:01.403
He's like, no, no, no.

01:01:01.403 --> 01:01:02.360
It's not a problem.

01:01:02.360 --> 01:01:03.060
I said, do you
think you can write

01:01:03.060 --> 01:01:04.829
me an email officially
stating that we

01:01:04.829 --> 01:01:06.120
have permission to shoot there?

01:01:06.120 --> 01:01:06.720
He's like, yeah, no problem.

01:01:06.720 --> 01:01:07.860
So he sends us an email.

01:01:07.860 --> 01:01:09.130
We go back to the
dude and say, OK, we

01:01:09.130 --> 01:01:10.110
have this piece of paper.

01:01:10.110 --> 01:01:10.600
Can we shoot there?

01:01:10.600 --> 01:01:11.850
And he says, nope, you can't.

01:01:11.850 --> 01:01:12.690
I'm like, why?

01:01:12.690 --> 01:01:14.220
Because the city
is not OK with it.

01:01:14.220 --> 01:01:15.890
You have to go to the City Hall
to get permission from them.

01:01:15.890 --> 01:01:17.515
I don't want any
trouble with the city.

01:01:17.515 --> 01:01:18.430
I'm like OK.

01:01:18.430 --> 01:01:20.571
We drove to City
Hall 15 minutes away.

01:01:20.571 --> 01:01:22.820
We showed up at their doorstep,
explain the situation,

01:01:22.820 --> 01:01:24.170
said hey, we want to
shoot at this shipwreck.

01:01:24.170 --> 01:01:24.720
Can we shoot there?

01:01:24.720 --> 01:01:25.428
This guy's crazy.

01:01:25.428 --> 01:01:26.150
He says no.

01:01:26.150 --> 01:01:26.710
They're like yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:01:26.710 --> 01:01:27.430
We have no problem with him.

01:01:27.430 --> 01:01:28.120
You can do whatever you want.

01:01:28.120 --> 01:01:29.100
I'm like, can I
have it in writing?

01:01:29.100 --> 01:01:30.766
I need a piece of
paper to show to him.

01:01:30.766 --> 01:01:31.319
Right.

01:01:31.319 --> 01:01:32.610
So he sends the piece of paper.

01:01:32.610 --> 01:01:32.906
We go back.

01:01:32.906 --> 01:01:35.170
Show it to him and say, OK, I
have all your pieces of paper.

01:01:35.170 --> 01:01:35.920
Can we shoot here?

01:01:35.920 --> 01:01:38.664
And he says, no but I don't
want any liability problems.

01:01:38.664 --> 01:01:40.580
I don't want-- if someone
gets injured on set,

01:01:40.580 --> 01:01:41.821
I'm going to be in trouble.

01:01:41.821 --> 01:01:44.320
I said, OK, what if we prepare
all these liability insurance

01:01:44.320 --> 01:01:44.820
forms?

01:01:44.820 --> 01:01:46.860
And he's like, I
guess that could work.

01:01:46.860 --> 01:01:49.164
And we went and got
all the liability.

01:01:49.164 --> 01:01:50.830
We just printed some
samples off Google,

01:01:50.830 --> 01:01:53.590
like these waiver forms, and
just signed all these papers--

01:01:53.590 --> 01:01:55.310
and we had to fax them to him,
because he didn't have email--

01:01:55.310 --> 01:01:56.320
and faxed all these
papers to him.

01:01:56.320 --> 01:01:57.570
Called him up and said,
OK, can we shoot here?

01:01:57.570 --> 01:01:59.950
And he said, well, I guess I
don't have a choice any more

01:01:59.950 --> 01:02:01.200
It doesn't matter or anything.

01:02:01.200 --> 01:02:02.630
[LAUGHTER]

01:02:02.630 --> 01:02:04.690
So this took about two
days to sort through.

01:02:04.690 --> 01:02:07.210
And then Wednesday--
so, three days

01:02:07.210 --> 01:02:08.950
before the shoot
was going to happen,

01:02:08.950 --> 01:02:11.470
I end up with permission finally
to shoot at the shipwreck.

01:02:11.470 --> 01:02:14.380
And I just bring these photos
of this amazing shipwreck,

01:02:14.380 --> 01:02:16.116
and I hit up a
clothing design store

01:02:16.116 --> 01:02:18.490
and I said, hey, we have access
to this amazing shipwreck

01:02:18.490 --> 01:02:19.259
for a weekend.

01:02:19.259 --> 01:02:20.300
I'm going to be shooting.

01:02:20.300 --> 01:02:21.650
I'm going to be teaching.

01:02:21.650 --> 01:02:23.340
Would you lend us some clothing?

01:02:23.340 --> 01:02:24.620
And then that's where
we found our designers.

01:02:24.620 --> 01:02:25.120
Same thing.

01:02:25.120 --> 01:02:27.070
We have these amazing costumes.

01:02:27.070 --> 01:02:28.944
We have this amazing location.

01:02:28.944 --> 01:02:30.110
Do you want to model for us?

01:02:30.110 --> 01:02:32.820
And within one week, we
built the entire shoot.

01:02:32.820 --> 01:02:33.620
So was it easy?

01:02:33.620 --> 01:02:35.350
No, it was a pain in the butt.

01:02:35.350 --> 01:02:37.370
It's a lot easier sometimes just
to trespass and sneak in there,

01:02:37.370 --> 01:02:38.536
but this time I was
teaching, and it

01:02:38.536 --> 01:02:40.286
needed to be official,
and all that stuff,

01:02:40.286 --> 01:02:41.820
but that's how it came to be.

01:02:41.820 --> 01:02:42.440
Right.

01:02:42.440 --> 01:02:43.650
So nothing easy.

01:02:43.650 --> 01:02:44.970
Hard work gets you there.

01:02:44.970 --> 01:02:48.500
Sometimes it's a lot easier,
sometimes a lot harder.

01:02:48.500 --> 01:02:49.000
Models.

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:49.650
How do you find models?

01:02:49.650 --> 01:02:51.070
And models-- there's everything.

01:02:51.070 --> 01:02:51.650
Facebook.

01:02:51.650 --> 01:02:54.344
Your friends-- you can guilt
them into modeling for you.

01:02:54.344 --> 01:02:55.260
You have Model Mayhem.

01:02:55.260 --> 01:02:57.135
You have all these
different resources online

01:02:57.135 --> 01:02:57.970
to find models.

01:02:57.970 --> 01:02:59.511
And I think the one
thing that people

01:02:59.511 --> 01:03:04.154
tend to overlook a little
bit is communities.

01:03:04.154 --> 01:03:06.320
If you can think of a-- if
there's a group of people

01:03:06.320 --> 01:03:07.560
that you're interested
in shooting,

01:03:07.560 --> 01:03:09.185
there's probably a
community around it,

01:03:09.185 --> 01:03:11.090
whether they dress up
as medieval characters,

01:03:11.090 --> 01:03:14.525
whether they dress up
as anime characters.

01:03:14.525 --> 01:03:16.025
When I first started
out photography

01:03:16.025 --> 01:03:17.990
and I wanted to do things
that were creative,

01:03:17.990 --> 01:03:20.670
I went to the fetish community,
because they will do anything

01:03:20.670 --> 01:03:23.620
and they have all the costumes,
all these different types,

01:03:23.620 --> 01:03:26.110
and they love the attention.

01:03:26.110 --> 01:03:28.330
So you ask any fetish
model whether they'll

01:03:28.330 --> 01:03:29.220
model for you,
they're just like,

01:03:29.220 --> 01:03:30.386
what do you want me to wear?

01:03:30.386 --> 01:03:33.400
And they'll show up there with
these completely crazy things.

01:03:33.400 --> 01:03:36.190
So if you find a community--
if there's something you like,

01:03:36.190 --> 01:03:37.120
there'll be a community for it.

01:03:37.120 --> 01:03:38.440
If you find one,
you find them all.

01:03:38.440 --> 01:03:39.200
It's just like, you
find one photographer,

01:03:39.200 --> 01:03:40.220
you find them all.

01:03:40.220 --> 01:03:42.640
It's a really easy equation.

01:03:42.640 --> 01:03:46.010
And some people get really
complicated about shoots.

01:03:46.010 --> 01:03:47.409
And sometimes I
like to do things

01:03:47.409 --> 01:03:48.950
that are a little
bit out of the box.

01:03:48.950 --> 01:03:50.658
And this over here,
this shoot over here,

01:03:50.658 --> 01:03:54.737
for example, every year
once a year in Montreal,

01:03:54.737 --> 01:03:56.570
there's something called
a Victorian picnic.

01:03:56.570 --> 01:03:59.042
And what it is is
just a group of people

01:03:59.042 --> 01:04:00.500
that dress up in
Victorian costumes

01:04:00.500 --> 01:04:03.630
show up at this picnic, and
they just have a picnic.

01:04:03.630 --> 01:04:05.884
And incidentally, when cool
people with cool costume

01:04:05.884 --> 01:04:07.925
show up at a picnic, well,
photographers show up.

01:04:07.925 --> 01:04:09.730
I think there's usually more
photographers than picnic

01:04:09.730 --> 01:04:10.390
people.

01:04:10.390 --> 01:04:12.879
But at the end of the day,
what I did differently

01:04:12.879 --> 01:04:14.920
from everybody else was
I reached out and I said,

01:04:14.920 --> 01:04:16.190
hey, do you guys
think it would be OK

01:04:16.190 --> 01:04:18.730
if I brought my mobile studio
and just bring some big lights

01:04:18.730 --> 01:04:20.394
and everything and go crazy?

01:04:20.394 --> 01:04:22.560
So instead of having the
semicircle of photographers

01:04:22.560 --> 01:04:24.807
around the one single
model, I wanted

01:04:24.807 --> 01:04:26.640
to do something a little
bit more elaborate.

01:04:26.640 --> 01:04:27.275
They said, sure, no problem.

01:04:27.275 --> 01:04:28.858
Just make sure you
ask for permission.

01:04:28.858 --> 01:04:29.747
So I said great.

01:04:29.747 --> 01:04:30.330
So went there.

01:04:30.330 --> 01:04:32.736
I got there about
an hour earlier

01:04:32.736 --> 01:04:34.390
with a group of my assistants.

01:04:34.390 --> 01:04:36.104
Walked around, made
friends with people.

01:04:36.104 --> 01:04:38.270
I think I was dressing up
in a corset at some point,

01:04:38.270 --> 01:04:40.360
twirling around, just
making friends, spotting

01:04:40.360 --> 01:04:42.220
all the people that I thought
would be interesting to shoot.

01:04:42.220 --> 01:04:43.500
Because these people didn't
actually know each other,

01:04:43.500 --> 01:04:45.790
but they're all dressed
in this similar fashion.

01:04:45.790 --> 01:04:47.655
I just started
keeping an eye out

01:04:47.655 --> 01:04:48.790
on all these different
individuals that

01:04:48.790 --> 01:04:49.280
were interesting.

01:04:49.280 --> 01:04:51.760
And after a while that people
had actually seen me there,

01:04:51.760 --> 01:04:53.985
they knew that I was
nonthreatening, I suppose,

01:04:53.985 --> 01:04:56.360
I decided to just bring all
these lights out and just set

01:04:56.360 --> 01:04:59.030
up this huge studio just in the
middle where we happened to be.

01:04:59.030 --> 01:05:00.900
And then we just source
all these people together

01:05:00.900 --> 01:05:02.490
and then suddenly I
had this crazy set

01:05:02.490 --> 01:05:03.940
that required zero preparation.

01:05:03.940 --> 01:05:06.290
I just showed up there
and thought a little bit

01:05:06.290 --> 01:05:06.790
differently.

01:05:06.790 --> 01:05:08.580
And because I had all
the big fancy lights,

01:05:08.580 --> 01:05:10.260
people were really interested
in what I was doing.

01:05:10.260 --> 01:05:11.410
So the first one was
a little bit harder,

01:05:11.410 --> 01:05:13.285
and then the rest just
kinda fell into place.

01:05:16.194 --> 01:05:17.110
Props and accessories.

01:05:17.110 --> 01:05:18.960
How do come across those?

01:05:18.960 --> 01:05:23.000
And really, it's just about
the same thing as models,

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.930
except that, on top of that,
you might have different stores,

01:05:25.930 --> 01:05:27.514
like prop stores,
centric stores.

01:05:27.514 --> 01:05:28.930
I think at the end
of the day, you

01:05:28.930 --> 01:05:32.345
have to think about what do
you have to offer them, right?

01:05:32.345 --> 01:05:34.470
Why would they be interested
in lending you things?

01:05:34.470 --> 01:05:35.870
That's if you want it for free--
if you want to pay for it,

01:05:35.870 --> 01:05:37.830
then it's usually quite easy.

01:05:37.830 --> 01:05:40.276
In my case, I don't like to
pay for things because I never

01:05:40.276 --> 01:05:42.650
end up keeping them, but I
like to have really cool props

01:05:42.650 --> 01:05:43.660
all the time.

01:05:43.660 --> 01:05:46.470
So I'm sure you
guys have all wanted

01:05:46.470 --> 01:05:51.190
to shoot with a
leopard or jaguar.

01:05:51.190 --> 01:05:55.500
And I've always wanted to
shoot with these animals,

01:05:55.500 --> 01:05:57.515
but, you know, getting
a trained jaguar just

01:05:57.515 --> 01:05:58.880
costs thousands and
thousands of dollars.

01:05:58.880 --> 01:06:00.296
So then I thought
to myself, well,

01:06:00.296 --> 01:06:04.000
why don't we actually just
take a dead one-- taxidermied?

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:07.330
So Adobe was flying down
to do a documentary on me,

01:06:07.330 --> 01:06:10.017
and they said that I could
shoot whatever I want,

01:06:10.017 --> 01:06:11.350
and then they would document it.

01:06:11.350 --> 01:06:13.517
So I said I better
make it exciting.

01:06:13.517 --> 01:06:15.100
So this is off in
Toronto, where there

01:06:15.100 --> 01:06:18.266
was a place called the
Scarborough Bluffs.

01:06:18.266 --> 01:06:19.640
And I wanted to
do a photo shoot.

01:06:19.640 --> 01:06:23.310
So I started looking around,
reaching out to my fan base,

01:06:23.310 --> 01:06:25.060
saying, hey, do you
guys have any contacts

01:06:25.060 --> 01:06:26.620
in the taxidermy industry?

01:06:26.620 --> 01:06:29.737
And one guy just came
up and said, hey, I do.

01:06:29.737 --> 01:06:30.570
I'm like, oh, great.

01:06:30.570 --> 01:06:32.265
He had worked with
them in the past.

01:06:32.265 --> 01:06:33.550
He gave me their
contact information.

01:06:33.550 --> 01:06:35.008
I could have Googled
them-- they're

01:06:35.008 --> 01:06:37.917
actually the biggest
taxidermy company in Canada.

01:06:37.917 --> 01:06:39.000
And I wrote them an email.

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:40.041
They didn't really reply.

01:06:40.041 --> 01:06:41.690
Wrote another
time, didn't reply.

01:06:41.690 --> 01:06:43.910
I finally just ended up
calling them and explaining

01:06:43.910 --> 01:06:47.120
that Adobe was going to do an
interview with me, that if they

01:06:47.120 --> 01:06:50.814
would be so kind as to lend
me one of their pets, maybe

01:06:50.814 --> 01:06:51.980
we could work something out.

01:06:51.980 --> 01:06:53.810
We'll get the film crew
to come in and document

01:06:53.810 --> 01:06:55.185
a little bit of
the surroundings.

01:06:55.185 --> 01:06:57.560
Everyone can use it as
a nice visibility panel.

01:06:57.560 --> 01:06:59.930
And they agreed.

01:06:59.930 --> 01:07:02.807
They said as long as you have
$50,000 of prop insurance--

01:07:02.807 --> 01:07:04.390
because apparently
one of these things

01:07:04.390 --> 01:07:07.710
has a value of about
$30,000 or $40,000--

01:07:07.710 --> 01:07:10.280
then we're more than
welcome to come and use it.

01:07:10.280 --> 01:07:11.247
And so we did.

01:07:11.247 --> 01:07:12.830
We ended up renting
a truck so that we

01:07:12.830 --> 01:07:14.121
could fit this stinky thing in.

01:07:14.121 --> 01:07:15.020
It's huge.

01:07:15.020 --> 01:07:18.170
And we're six people
carrying a piece of plywood

01:07:18.170 --> 01:07:21.270
carrying a Jaguar down the
beach to the exact place

01:07:21.270 --> 01:07:22.840
that we needed it.

01:07:22.840 --> 01:07:24.179
So how do you find super props?

01:07:24.179 --> 01:07:25.470
Find the places that sell them.

01:07:25.470 --> 01:07:26.830
Find a place that retail them.

01:07:26.830 --> 01:07:28.560
If you can't afford
to buy it, give them

01:07:28.560 --> 01:07:31.370
something that they
can use in return.

01:07:31.370 --> 01:07:32.217
And talent-- talent.

01:07:32.217 --> 01:07:34.425
You know, the fun thing
about talent-- and by talent,

01:07:34.425 --> 01:07:36.370
I mean hair, makeup,
all that other stuff.

01:07:36.370 --> 01:07:38.100
Body-painters.

01:07:38.100 --> 01:07:41.070
You know, I think the key thing
is that these artists are also

01:07:41.070 --> 01:07:44.382
just as driven by
great work as you are.

01:07:44.382 --> 01:07:46.340
And the reason they would
want to work with you

01:07:46.340 --> 01:07:48.631
is because you can represent
their work in the best way

01:07:48.631 --> 01:07:49.670
possible.

01:07:49.670 --> 01:07:52.030
And the thing is, if you
start doing the things

01:07:52.030 --> 01:07:54.920
that you love and you start
creating content that you're

01:07:54.920 --> 01:07:57.380
passionate about that other
people like to look at,

01:07:57.380 --> 01:07:59.110
then you're going to attract the
people that like what you do,

01:07:59.110 --> 01:07:59.610
too.

01:07:59.610 --> 01:08:02.800
So it all works really,
really nicely together.

01:08:02.800 --> 01:08:07.450
Very recently I did this photo
shoot with this body-painter.

01:08:07.450 --> 01:08:10.810
This was actually done in LA
just a week, two weeks ago.

01:08:10.810 --> 01:08:12.680
It was like 10 days ago.

01:08:12.680 --> 01:08:15.172
And this guy's name
is Michael Rosner.

01:08:15.172 --> 01:08:16.630
And I had seen his
work pass online

01:08:16.630 --> 01:08:19.390
on one of those viral,
Buzzfeed type of websites.

01:08:19.390 --> 01:08:21.060
And I saw it and I
was just blown away

01:08:21.060 --> 01:08:22.870
by how amazingly
detailed and intricate

01:08:22.870 --> 01:08:24.760
his body-painting work was.

01:08:24.760 --> 01:08:27.409
And I really wanted to
meet up with him a year

01:08:27.409 --> 01:08:29.450
and a half ago, when I
came to LA the first time.

01:08:29.450 --> 01:08:30.300
And it just didn't happen.

01:08:30.300 --> 01:08:32.300
I had added him on Facebook,
reached out to him,

01:08:32.300 --> 01:08:34.111
shown him my work.

01:08:34.111 --> 01:08:36.069
And this time around when
I came to LA, I said,

01:08:36.069 --> 01:08:36.943
I'm working with you.

01:08:36.943 --> 01:08:39.600
This is the one project
that I really want to do.

01:08:39.600 --> 01:08:42.919
I helped fund the
designers to make

01:08:42.919 --> 01:08:44.960
the costumes for the shoot,
specifically designed

01:08:44.960 --> 01:08:47.490
to create something with
an underwater feel to it,

01:08:47.490 --> 01:08:48.545
and got it all together.

01:08:48.545 --> 01:08:50.170
But the only reason
these people wanted

01:08:50.170 --> 01:08:51.586
to work with me
in the first place

01:08:51.586 --> 01:08:53.430
is because I do
things-- I gravitate

01:08:53.430 --> 01:08:55.080
towards what they want to do.

01:08:55.080 --> 01:08:57.050
You have to always
think about what do you

01:08:57.050 --> 01:08:58.920
have to offer in return?

01:08:58.920 --> 01:09:00.970
In my case, my selling
point to this guy

01:09:00.970 --> 01:09:05.010
who arguably is just as
successful as myself in the UV

01:09:05.010 --> 01:09:07.340
world, if not more, I had
to come up with a product,

01:09:07.340 --> 01:09:09.600
like a pitch, to
get him interested.

01:09:09.600 --> 01:09:12.042
And my pitch was that I had
these brand-new fancy lights

01:09:12.042 --> 01:09:13.500
from Broncolor that
they were going

01:09:13.500 --> 01:09:15.560
to be lending me that output UV.

01:09:15.560 --> 01:09:19.100
So I had UV flashes, which
meant that nobody else could

01:09:19.100 --> 01:09:22.970
get these really, really crisp,
clean ultraviolet imagery,

01:09:22.970 --> 01:09:26.800
because usually it
outputs so little light.

01:09:26.800 --> 01:09:28.050
And it worked.

01:09:28.050 --> 01:09:31.824
And it worked only because this
entire time, these last three

01:09:31.824 --> 01:09:33.490
years, my portfolio
that's been building

01:09:33.490 --> 01:09:36.740
has all been about these
extravagant, cool things that

01:09:36.740 --> 01:09:38.729
are focused on new
technology, new gizmos, that

01:09:38.729 --> 01:09:39.680
would potentially

01:09:39.680 --> 01:09:41.310
Bring in more work
for him, which

01:09:41.310 --> 01:09:43.330
is what he's interested in.

01:09:43.330 --> 01:09:46.899
So you've all of this stuff--
location, models, props,

01:09:46.899 --> 01:09:47.979
and talents.

01:09:47.979 --> 01:09:49.738
How do you actually
coordinate all that?

01:09:49.738 --> 01:09:51.029
How do you get people together?

01:09:51.029 --> 01:09:53.362
How do you bring them together
to want to work with you?

01:09:53.362 --> 01:09:56.010
And I have a couple tips that
have been really interesting.

01:09:56.010 --> 01:09:58.176
The first is to make things
into group projects, not

01:09:58.176 --> 01:09:58.780
your projects.

01:09:58.780 --> 01:10:03.000
That means that, if the
project is about us,

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:03.900
it's a lot stronger.

01:10:03.900 --> 01:10:05.441
If I go up to someone
and say, I want

01:10:05.441 --> 01:10:07.530
you to do this for me,
that's usually on an I

01:10:07.530 --> 01:10:08.510
want to hire you basis.

01:10:08.510 --> 01:10:09.940
But if you say, let's
do something together--

01:10:09.940 --> 01:10:11.870
what do you think, it
becomes a lot more communal.

01:10:11.870 --> 01:10:13.070
People get a lot more
involved because they

01:10:13.070 --> 01:10:13.861
have a stake in it.

01:10:13.861 --> 01:10:18.100
It becomes about that
interaction between two people.

01:10:18.100 --> 01:10:21.080
Explain to people how the
products are good for them.

01:10:21.080 --> 01:10:22.960
So the difference
between saying,

01:10:22.960 --> 01:10:26.500
hey guys-- say I was talking
Michael Rosner and I said, hey,

01:10:26.500 --> 01:10:27.500
I really love your work.

01:10:27.500 --> 01:10:28.760
It would look amazing
in my portfolio.

01:10:28.760 --> 01:10:30.259
You absolutely have
to work with me.

01:10:30.259 --> 01:10:31.360
It would be amazing.

01:10:31.360 --> 01:10:34.095
That's significantly weaker
than me perusing his portfolio

01:10:34.095 --> 01:10:36.470
and saying, hello, I've looked
at your ultraviolet shots,

01:10:36.470 --> 01:10:36.870
and you know what?

01:10:36.870 --> 01:10:37.770
I've noticed
there's a little bit

01:10:37.770 --> 01:10:39.790
lack of detail in
your work, and that's

01:10:39.790 --> 01:10:41.360
because you don't have the
right equipment for the job.

01:10:41.360 --> 01:10:43.900
I happen to have sponsors
that are going to be giving me

01:10:43.900 --> 01:10:46.640
$5,000 of equipment that will
now allow me to make your work

01:10:46.640 --> 01:10:48.180
look better than it's ever
been presented before.

01:10:48.180 --> 01:10:50.320
Do you want to work together
with me on something?

01:10:50.320 --> 01:10:51.780
That's significantly stronger.

01:10:51.780 --> 01:10:54.920
And it's the same exact pitch,
just phrased differently.

01:10:54.920 --> 01:10:57.394
And I think that presenting
this, I'm thinking in this way,

01:10:57.394 --> 01:10:59.560
and just on the general,
everyday basis of coming up

01:10:59.560 --> 01:11:01.746
to people and talking to
them about how they're

01:11:01.746 --> 01:11:03.370
going to benefit from
working with you,

01:11:03.370 --> 01:11:05.650
is extremely powerful,
extremely fun.

01:11:05.650 --> 01:11:06.920
Right.

01:11:06.920 --> 01:11:11.270
Delegating things is also a
really interesting approach.

01:11:11.270 --> 01:11:13.740
There's a bunch of benefits
of delegating work.

01:11:13.740 --> 01:11:15.637
The first is, if
you delegate it,

01:11:15.637 --> 01:11:16.970
you don't have to do it so much.

01:11:16.970 --> 01:11:18.282
You have less to do.

01:11:18.282 --> 01:11:20.740
The second is that, when you
delegate something to someone,

01:11:20.740 --> 01:11:22.950
give them something to do,
they become more involved.

01:11:22.950 --> 01:11:24.908
They're investing more
time into your projects.

01:11:24.908 --> 01:11:26.770
In my case, for
example, I have a model

01:11:26.770 --> 01:11:31.260
that I want to get involved into
my project a little bit more.

01:11:31.260 --> 01:11:33.310
And we're looking for, I
don't know, a red dress.

01:11:33.310 --> 01:11:35.480
And I say, hey, do you think
you can look into your wardrobe?

01:11:35.480 --> 01:11:37.150
Do you have any red dresses
that you have there?

01:11:37.150 --> 01:11:38.816
I'm kind of not too
sure which direction

01:11:38.816 --> 01:11:40.000
I want to take this project.

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:41.390
If you can take some
selfies of yourself

01:11:41.390 --> 01:11:42.520
in these different
dresses, I'd just

01:11:42.520 --> 01:11:43.970
love to see what they look like.

01:11:43.970 --> 01:11:44.820
And she sends them
back and like, oh,

01:11:44.820 --> 01:11:45.860
I don't actually
like any of those.

01:11:45.860 --> 01:11:47.460
Do you think you could go
to some stores that you like

01:11:47.460 --> 01:11:49.010
and just maybe take some
shots of things you like?

01:11:49.010 --> 01:11:50.890
Maybe create a Pinterest board
of dresses that you think

01:11:50.890 --> 01:11:51.900
would be interesting.

01:11:51.900 --> 01:11:53.569
We'll see what we
can come up with.

01:11:53.569 --> 01:11:55.110
And then suddenly
this girl's already

01:11:55.110 --> 01:11:58.220
put now like three hours,
whatever, into the shoot.

01:11:58.220 --> 01:12:00.390
It's not just the
"yes, I'll come"

01:12:00.390 --> 01:12:01.934
one-line text and Facebook.

01:12:01.934 --> 01:12:03.350
So the day before
the photo shoot,

01:12:03.350 --> 01:12:05.170
if she's gotten into an
argument with her boyfriend

01:12:05.170 --> 01:12:07.210
at 2 in the morning, and she's
just crying all night long,

01:12:07.210 --> 01:12:08.950
and woke up, and the shoot's
at 6 o'clock in the morning.

01:12:08.950 --> 01:12:10.042
She wakes up, she's
hungover, and she

01:12:10.042 --> 01:12:11.240
doesn't want to
come to your shoot,

01:12:11.240 --> 01:12:12.740
well, she's already
invested a little bit more

01:12:12.740 --> 01:12:13.770
time into the project.

01:12:13.770 --> 01:12:15.570
She's invested a lot
more effort into it.

01:12:15.570 --> 01:12:17.410
So they're even more
likely to show up,

01:12:17.410 --> 01:12:19.411
because, once again, it's
not just your project.

01:12:19.411 --> 01:12:21.660
It's their project, this
project that they care about,

01:12:21.660 --> 01:12:23.850
it's a project that they
want to be involved in.

01:12:23.850 --> 01:12:26.100
So delegating is super cool,
because not only does it

01:12:26.100 --> 01:12:27.872
reduce your workload,
people get involved.

01:12:27.872 --> 01:12:29.330
They feel like they
mean something.

01:12:29.330 --> 01:12:32.400
They feel like they have a more
important stake in the project,

01:12:32.400 --> 01:12:35.347
and it's just great
vibes all around.

01:12:35.347 --> 01:12:37.180
Following up with things
is super important.

01:12:37.180 --> 01:12:37.390
Why?

01:12:37.390 --> 01:12:38.681
People are really, really busy.

01:12:38.681 --> 01:12:40.424
People have things to do.

01:12:40.424 --> 01:12:41.840
You know, if you
don't remind them

01:12:41.840 --> 01:12:44.050
that they're supposed to be
doing something with you,

01:12:44.050 --> 01:12:45.290
they're going to
forget about it,

01:12:45.290 --> 01:12:47.250
and they're not going to be
part of the project anymore.

01:12:47.250 --> 01:12:49.860
So you can't just get someone
interested three months down

01:12:49.860 --> 01:12:51.490
the line, ignore them for
three months, and show up

01:12:51.490 --> 01:12:53.660
and say, hey, why didn't
you show up to my project?

01:12:53.660 --> 01:12:55.800
They completely forgot about it,
because you didn't follow up.

01:12:55.800 --> 01:12:58.090
You didn't make sure that
they were still interested.

01:12:58.090 --> 01:13:00.380
So I like to create
Facebook groups online.

01:13:00.380 --> 01:13:01.910
I create these little groups,
these little communities.

01:13:01.910 --> 01:13:03.160
We post pictures
up occasionally.

01:13:03.160 --> 01:13:04.860
Every time there's
a new person that's

01:13:04.860 --> 01:13:06.526
added to the project,
every time there's

01:13:06.526 --> 01:13:08.430
a new update in
the development, I

01:13:08.430 --> 01:13:10.820
share it just to keep
people interested,

01:13:10.820 --> 01:13:12.640
to show them that things
are going forward.

01:13:12.640 --> 01:13:14.598
Because these are large
projects that take time

01:13:14.598 --> 01:13:16.510
to come together, people
need to be reminded

01:13:16.510 --> 01:13:18.681
of what they're waiting
for along the way.

01:13:18.681 --> 01:13:20.930
And then last but not least,
you have to take control.

01:13:20.930 --> 01:13:23.410
So I talk a lot about
all these group projects.

01:13:23.410 --> 01:13:27.932
I talk a lot about how
everybody is entitled

01:13:27.932 --> 01:13:29.640
to pitching their
opinions, because these

01:13:29.640 --> 01:13:31.629
are team projects, these
are team orientations.

01:13:31.629 --> 01:13:33.170
But you still need
to be able to take

01:13:33.170 --> 01:13:34.380
control of the final project.

01:13:34.380 --> 01:13:36.840
You still need to be
able to take charge

01:13:36.840 --> 01:13:38.569
and say, well, this
is what I want to do.

01:13:38.569 --> 01:13:39.360
This is the vision.

01:13:39.360 --> 01:13:41.290
Because there's only one person
at the end of the day who's

01:13:41.290 --> 01:13:42.410
going to be shooting it.

01:13:42.410 --> 01:13:43.370
There's only one
person that is going

01:13:43.370 --> 01:13:44.520
to be editing it
and publishing it.

01:13:44.520 --> 01:13:46.500
So that's probably going
to be the photographer.

01:13:46.500 --> 01:13:48.185
So you have to know
what you want to do,

01:13:48.185 --> 01:13:51.090
and you have to be
able to perform it.

01:13:51.090 --> 01:13:54.000
Now, you have all
those four factors.

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.250
You know how to get them,
you know to get your talent,

01:13:56.250 --> 01:13:57.340
you know how to
get your elements.

01:13:57.340 --> 01:13:58.540
What could you
possibly be missing?

01:13:58.540 --> 01:13:59.190
And that's technique.

01:13:59.190 --> 01:14:00.394
And I think technique
is one of the things

01:14:00.394 --> 01:14:02.727
that we, especially the geeky
engineering type of people

01:14:02.727 --> 01:14:05.340
like myself, really
get caught up on.

01:14:05.340 --> 01:14:07.840
And you don't want people--
like people don't look at images

01:14:07.840 --> 01:14:08.670
and say, oh, wow.

01:14:08.670 --> 01:14:10.682
That's an amazing three
point lighting set up!

01:14:10.682 --> 01:14:11.640
Nobody thinks that way.

01:14:11.640 --> 01:14:14.594
They see a story, and
then they appreciate it,

01:14:14.594 --> 01:14:16.760
and then the technique that
you've used to create it

01:14:16.760 --> 01:14:17.760
just becomes incidental.

01:14:17.760 --> 01:14:19.471
Nobody actually cares
about the technique

01:14:19.471 --> 01:14:20.970
that is used to
achieve the results.

01:14:20.970 --> 01:14:22.606
So for example, this
image over here.

01:14:22.606 --> 01:14:23.230
You look at it.

01:14:23.230 --> 01:14:26.377
You don't go like, wow, that's
an amazing long exposure

01:14:26.377 --> 01:14:27.710
shot combined with some flashes.

01:14:27.710 --> 01:14:29.890
You don't see that, but
that's exactly what it was.

01:14:29.890 --> 01:14:32.390
So in my case, what happened
was I bought some leaf filters.

01:14:32.390 --> 01:14:33.910
That meant I could
drag the shutter.

01:14:33.910 --> 01:14:35.990
I could bring some flashes
that the battery power strobes

01:14:35.990 --> 01:14:37.150
that were a little bit
closer, and this is something

01:14:37.150 --> 01:14:38.441
that I want to experiment with.

01:14:38.441 --> 01:14:40.982
It was a new technique, but it
was built into a story line.

01:14:40.982 --> 01:14:43.190
I knew that if I had a girl
crash on top of the waves

01:14:43.190 --> 01:14:45.390
that look really good,
but it fits a story.

01:14:45.390 --> 01:14:46.460
It's not for the effect.

01:14:46.460 --> 01:14:50.460
The effect only serves
to enhance the story.

01:14:50.460 --> 01:14:51.990
Right?

01:14:51.990 --> 01:14:54.650
And so if you have all of the
stuff, you have your technique,

01:14:54.650 --> 01:14:58.120
you have your models, and now
you want to tell your story,

01:14:58.120 --> 01:15:00.440
it doesn't really
matter anymore what

01:15:00.440 --> 01:15:02.190
elements you have and
ones you don't have,

01:15:02.190 --> 01:15:05.300
because all the things that
you learn along the way

01:15:05.300 --> 01:15:06.700
can be applied in any context.

01:15:06.700 --> 01:15:08.660
This was a shoot that
I did in 24 hours

01:15:08.660 --> 01:15:12.840
from the time the stylist
actually showed up to the rest,

01:15:12.840 --> 01:15:15.510
to find the model,
design the costumes.

01:15:15.510 --> 01:15:17.430
We found the location
the day of the shoot.

01:15:17.430 --> 01:15:20.630
One hour before I got there,
I started doing some scouting.

01:15:20.630 --> 01:15:21.750
The technique to light it.

01:15:21.750 --> 01:15:23.416
All these things are
in the back burner,

01:15:23.416 --> 01:15:25.990
because once you've mastered
how to make all of this work,

01:15:25.990 --> 01:15:28.430
it's just a question about
recycling it and reapplying it

01:15:28.430 --> 01:15:30.340
into whatever context
you need to do.

01:15:30.340 --> 01:15:34.340
It doesn't matter anymore
what's easy and what's not.

01:15:34.340 --> 01:15:36.460
And this, I suppose,
at the day, you

01:15:36.460 --> 01:15:38.600
can summarize into being
the "epic formula."

01:15:38.600 --> 01:15:41.880
And I can already hear people
complaining and saying, well,

01:15:41.880 --> 01:15:42.880
my work's not epic.

01:15:42.880 --> 01:15:44.410
It doesn't work
that way anyways.

01:15:44.410 --> 01:15:46.882
And you know, what it really
is at the end of day, what

01:15:46.882 --> 01:15:49.340
the difference is between the
epic an ordinary is something

01:15:49.340 --> 01:15:51.240
that us as photographers
do every single day,

01:15:51.240 --> 01:15:54.250
because you take what is
ordinary with your camera,

01:15:54.250 --> 01:15:56.850
and because of the lens, the
perspective, the lighting,

01:15:56.850 --> 01:15:58.230
the color toning,
all this stuff,

01:15:58.230 --> 01:16:00.380
you make something that
is ordinary into something

01:16:00.380 --> 01:16:01.220
that is epic.

01:16:01.220 --> 01:16:02.550
That is what you do.

01:16:02.550 --> 01:16:04.390
Am I running out of time?

01:16:04.390 --> 01:16:05.140
I have 15 minutes?

01:16:05.140 --> 01:16:05.455
All right.

01:16:05.455 --> 01:16:06.550
I'll try to talk faster.

01:16:06.550 --> 01:16:07.383
I can't talk faster.

01:16:07.383 --> 01:16:09.380
I'm talking fast.

01:16:09.380 --> 01:16:11.586
But as photographers,
that's exactly what we do.

01:16:11.586 --> 01:16:12.960
We transform things
that are epic

01:16:12.960 --> 01:16:15.043
and we make them into--
something that is ordinary

01:16:15.043 --> 01:16:17.020
and make them into
something extraordinary.

01:16:17.020 --> 01:16:18.780
And I have a couple
other examples

01:16:18.780 --> 01:16:20.370
from other
photographers out there,

01:16:20.370 --> 01:16:22.120
because I know that
you don't believe me.

01:16:22.120 --> 01:16:24.790
And we can look at the work of
other photographers out there.

01:16:24.790 --> 01:16:25.440
So Jason Lee.

01:16:25.440 --> 01:16:29.200
He took photos of his
sons and daughter-- sorry,

01:16:29.200 --> 01:16:31.050
his two daughters--
for a mother that

01:16:31.050 --> 01:16:33.120
couldn't see them because
she was hospitalized,

01:16:33.120 --> 01:16:35.980
and just came up with all these
creative ways of showcasing

01:16:35.980 --> 01:16:38.170
his kids to his parents.

01:16:38.170 --> 01:16:38.840
Jill Greenberg.

01:16:38.840 --> 01:16:40.715
Taking kids-- not the
most exciting subject--

01:16:40.715 --> 01:16:42.686
but putting them with
really edgy lighting,

01:16:42.686 --> 01:16:44.310
different concept,
different storyline,

01:16:44.310 --> 01:16:45.930
into something that
was very atypical,

01:16:45.930 --> 01:16:47.050
telling something epic.

01:16:47.050 --> 01:16:49.502
And then sometimes when
you do these projects,

01:16:49.502 --> 01:16:50.710
they get picked up by people.

01:16:50.710 --> 01:16:51.280
Seth Casteel.

01:16:51.280 --> 01:16:53.850
Pet photography-- also not
the most exciting of things.

01:16:53.850 --> 01:16:54.920
But because he came
up with the idea

01:16:54.920 --> 01:16:56.480
of throwing a ball
into the water,

01:16:56.480 --> 01:16:58.896
having these dogs come in just
looks completely different,

01:16:58.896 --> 01:17:01.010
looks completely exciting.

01:17:01.010 --> 01:17:04.500
Joey L. Going off to exotic
countries, traveling.

01:17:04.500 --> 01:17:06.780
Going to the effort of
going there one month

01:17:06.780 --> 01:17:09.437
before to meet the
locals, going back

01:17:09.437 --> 01:17:11.520
another month after,
bringing [INAUDIBLE] strobes,

01:17:11.520 --> 01:17:16.589
medium format cameras, all
of these different things

01:17:16.589 --> 01:17:19.130
to come and shoot these images
in a way that hasn't been done

01:17:19.130 --> 01:17:20.930
before, and then
coming back a month

01:17:20.930 --> 01:17:24.300
after that to deliver full-size
prints to these locals who

01:17:24.300 --> 01:17:26.130
have never had their
photo taken before.

01:17:26.130 --> 01:17:28.460
Something that's
absolutely fantastical.

01:17:28.460 --> 01:17:29.400
Martin Kilmas.

01:17:29.400 --> 01:17:31.840
Product photography,
which is a boring subject.

01:17:31.840 --> 01:17:33.930
But because he had taken
these subjects, put them

01:17:33.930 --> 01:17:37.140
onto a high speed end trigger,
creating these really dynamic

01:17:37.140 --> 01:17:40.080
action shots, it looks
really, really cool.

01:17:40.080 --> 01:17:40.620
Quin Miller.

01:17:40.620 --> 01:17:43.036
The T-Rex bride-- I'm sure all
of you guys have seen this.

01:17:43.036 --> 01:17:43.640
Same.

01:17:43.640 --> 01:17:45.100
He didn't come off with
the idea of saying,

01:17:45.100 --> 01:17:46.670
I'm going to make something
that's going to go viral.

01:17:46.670 --> 01:17:47.750
He came along with
this idea of saying,

01:17:47.750 --> 01:17:48.890
I'm going to have
fun with what I do.

01:17:48.890 --> 01:17:50.200
I'm going to do
what I love, and I'm

01:17:50.200 --> 01:17:52.325
going to create something
interesting and something

01:17:52.325 --> 01:17:54.430
exciting.

01:17:54.430 --> 01:17:56.520
So anyone can do it.

01:17:56.520 --> 01:17:58.162
There's not really an excuse.

01:17:58.162 --> 01:17:59.580
Just a matter of perception.

01:17:59.580 --> 01:18:01.121
No, we don't have
time for questions.

01:18:01.121 --> 01:18:03.376
So I want to talk about
failure really quickly.

01:18:03.376 --> 01:18:05.500
And failure I think is one
of those subjects that's

01:18:05.500 --> 01:18:07.770
really important, because it's
something that a lot of people

01:18:07.770 --> 01:18:09.200
have to go through--
or, everyone

01:18:09.200 --> 01:18:11.190
has to go through it, really.

01:18:11.190 --> 01:18:12.930
I have this quote over here that
I think is really interesting.

01:18:12.930 --> 01:18:15.150
It's "I failed my way to
success" by Thomas Edison.

01:18:15.150 --> 01:18:17.947
And I really believe
that's just how it works.

01:18:17.947 --> 01:18:19.780
You can't wake up and
succeed at everything.

01:18:19.780 --> 01:18:21.780
That's just not how
the world works.

01:18:21.780 --> 01:18:23.407
I went to a conference
off in January,

01:18:23.407 --> 01:18:25.990
and one of the presenters there
said this quote that I thought

01:18:25.990 --> 01:18:26.781
was really amazing.

01:18:26.781 --> 01:18:29.809
And he said, "The definition
of success is to suck less."

01:18:29.809 --> 01:18:31.850
So if every day, you suck
less and less and less,

01:18:31.850 --> 01:18:34.440
eventually you're going
to be successful, right?

01:18:34.440 --> 01:18:37.370
And I have stories of a
failure here for you guys.

01:18:37.370 --> 01:18:40.755
And there's these two failures,
which is Von Wong and fire.

01:18:40.755 --> 01:18:42.130
For those of you
who know my work

01:18:42.130 --> 01:18:43.120
or are relatively
familiar with it,

01:18:43.120 --> 01:18:45.050
you'll know I shoot
a lot of fire work.

01:18:45.050 --> 01:18:46.880
And this started off
with two failures.

01:18:46.880 --> 01:18:49.171
So the first failure was when
I tried to light somebody

01:18:49.171 --> 01:18:50.010
on fire.

01:18:50.010 --> 01:18:52.747
So the idea came because we
have the Fstoppers competition,

01:18:52.747 --> 01:18:55.330
and I told myself that, you know
what, even if I couldn't win,

01:18:55.330 --> 01:18:56.630
at least I'd do
something so outrageous

01:18:56.630 --> 01:18:57.897
that people would remember it.

01:18:57.897 --> 01:18:59.480
And that was to light
someone on fire.

01:18:59.480 --> 01:19:01.340
And I know what you
guys are all thinking--

01:19:01.340 --> 01:19:03.756
that I roasted the guy alive
and that was the end of that.

01:19:03.756 --> 01:19:05.714
But no, what
actually happened was

01:19:05.714 --> 01:19:06.880
that this guy wouldn't burn.

01:19:06.880 --> 01:19:07.960
It didn't really
matter what we did.

01:19:07.960 --> 01:19:09.650
I don't know if it was because
we were shooting in December,

01:19:09.650 --> 01:19:11.986
because we were stupid,
shooting in December,

01:19:11.986 --> 01:19:14.110
it was super windy that
day, the fuel wasn't right.

01:19:14.110 --> 01:19:15.276
Something just wasn't right.

01:19:15.276 --> 01:19:17.124
And almost all the
fire that you see

01:19:17.124 --> 01:19:18.290
is pretty much Photoshopped.

01:19:18.290 --> 01:19:19.210
He just wouldn't burn.

01:19:19.210 --> 01:19:20.710
It didn't really
matter what we did.

01:19:20.710 --> 01:19:21.940
So it drove me crazy.

01:19:21.940 --> 01:19:23.130
Cost us $350.

01:19:23.130 --> 01:19:27.049
Turns out it's really expensive
to light a person on fire.

01:19:27.049 --> 01:19:29.340
If ever you want to light
someone on fire, you'll know.

01:19:29.340 --> 01:19:31.448
And $350 to light
this guy on fire.

01:19:31.448 --> 01:19:33.406
So I complained to the
pyrotechnician and said,

01:19:33.406 --> 01:19:35.260
you know what, you're
supposed to do it.

01:19:35.260 --> 01:19:36.106
Didn't work out.

01:19:36.106 --> 01:19:37.355
It's all your fault, na na na.

01:19:37.355 --> 01:19:38.280
He said, OK, OK.

01:19:38.280 --> 01:19:41.010
Why don't we do a shoot next
week, and I'll be the model?

01:19:41.010 --> 01:19:42.730
And this time we'll
do like a stunt man

01:19:42.730 --> 01:19:44.490
on fire, like I'll
go on a motorcycle,

01:19:44.490 --> 01:19:46.143
light myself on fire, and you
can have some epic pictures.

01:19:46.143 --> 01:19:47.050
And I said, great!

01:19:47.050 --> 01:19:48.890
That sounds even better.

01:19:48.890 --> 01:19:50.874
So moving on, that became
failure number two,

01:19:50.874 --> 01:19:53.290
because failure number two,
we had the exact same problem,

01:19:53.290 --> 01:19:53.700
unfortunately.

01:19:53.700 --> 01:19:55.120
Even though we went in
a more sheltered place,

01:19:55.120 --> 01:19:56.578
it was probably a
little bit colder

01:19:56.578 --> 01:19:58.999
because we're still
in December in Canada.

01:19:58.999 --> 01:20:00.540
And we try lighting
this guy on fire.

01:20:00.540 --> 01:20:02.460
So the same thing--
the entire body's

01:20:02.460 --> 01:20:04.050
supposed to be engulfed
in flames, and this time

01:20:04.050 --> 01:20:05.440
he just would burn
in little patches.

01:20:05.440 --> 01:20:06.523
It just wouldn't work out.

01:20:06.523 --> 01:20:07.570
Didn't really matter.

01:20:07.570 --> 01:20:08.550
So what did I do?

01:20:08.550 --> 01:20:09.429
Photoshop.

01:20:09.429 --> 01:20:10.970
There's not really
any way around it.

01:20:10.970 --> 01:20:13.460
At the end of day, you gather
all these people around

01:20:13.460 --> 01:20:16.384
to deliver a final
result, and this

01:20:16.384 --> 01:20:17.800
was the closest
that we could get.

01:20:17.800 --> 01:20:22.540
So the culmination
of these two failures

01:20:22.540 --> 01:20:24.750
was, unfortunately,
a lot of popularity.

01:20:24.750 --> 01:20:26.177
So these pictures,
these videos--

01:20:26.177 --> 01:20:27.760
these behind-the-scenes
videos started

01:20:27.760 --> 01:20:28.715
getting featured
all over the place,

01:20:28.715 --> 01:20:30.580
and I think they were my most
viral videos at the time.

01:20:30.580 --> 01:20:31.413
And I was like, why?

01:20:31.413 --> 01:20:34.130
Why, out of all my photos
that are so much nicer,

01:20:34.130 --> 01:20:36.580
why did these
failures get featured?

01:20:36.580 --> 01:20:39.324
And the result of one of
these videos at the end

01:20:39.324 --> 01:20:40.740
was this dude who
left a comment--

01:20:40.740 --> 01:20:41.970
his name is Andre Dass.

01:20:41.970 --> 01:20:44.010
He's a pyrotechnician
off in France.

01:20:44.010 --> 01:20:46.196
And he said, your
photos are awesome,

01:20:46.196 --> 01:20:47.570
but your fire work
kind of sucks.

01:20:47.570 --> 01:20:49.176
And I was like, ha!

01:20:49.176 --> 01:20:49.800
You're amazing.

01:20:49.800 --> 01:20:51.090
You know what you're
talking about.

01:20:51.090 --> 01:20:53.214
So I reached out to him
and I started stalking him.

01:20:53.214 --> 01:20:56.362
I saw his work, and it was
some amazing fire stuff.

01:20:56.362 --> 01:20:58.570
And I asked him if he wanted
to collaborate together,

01:20:58.570 --> 01:21:01.390
and he said, when you come
to France, we'll talk.

01:21:01.390 --> 01:21:04.510
And when I had my Europe project
to travel through Europe,

01:21:04.510 --> 01:21:07.520
I reached out to him, and I
said I'd love to work with you.

01:21:07.520 --> 01:21:08.890
And we ended up doing that.

01:21:08.890 --> 01:21:11.200
And then that was the
time where we really

01:21:11.200 --> 01:21:12.700
started working
together, and that's

01:21:12.700 --> 01:21:15.390
where all my most iconic
fire work actually

01:21:15.390 --> 01:21:16.310
started to take place.

01:21:16.310 --> 01:21:19.930
This was when we finally managed
to find the best combination

01:21:19.930 --> 01:21:22.160
of the guy who was able
to perform the effect,

01:21:22.160 --> 01:21:23.860
and me who was able
to tell the story.

01:21:23.860 --> 01:21:27.230
And we've done everything from
blending Tesla coils with fire

01:21:27.230 --> 01:21:28.950
to actually going to
different countries

01:21:28.950 --> 01:21:32.090
and performing
these different fire

01:21:32.090 --> 01:21:36.710
pieces all over the place, which
was absolutely fantastical.

01:21:36.710 --> 01:21:38.242
No time for questions.

01:21:38.242 --> 01:21:40.450
[LAUGHTER]

01:21:40.450 --> 01:21:42.490
So now the last
part is Photoshop.

01:21:42.490 --> 01:21:44.490
And I think Photoshop is
always a really, really

01:21:44.490 --> 01:21:45.780
interesting piece of the puzzle.

01:21:45.780 --> 01:21:47.670
It's something that everybody
always wants to see.

01:21:47.670 --> 01:21:48.880
And they make a
huge deal about it,

01:21:48.880 --> 01:21:50.040
because they think that
everything that I do

01:21:50.040 --> 01:21:52.410
is Photoshop, and they think
that if they could just

01:21:52.410 --> 01:21:54.055
find out the secret
for what I do,

01:21:54.055 --> 01:21:55.680
then they would be
able to do the same.

01:21:55.680 --> 01:21:57.250
And I have some bad
news, and that's

01:21:57.250 --> 01:21:59.530
that Photoshop is just
a tool like any other.

01:21:59.530 --> 01:22:01.420
It's just one piece
of the puzzle.

01:22:01.420 --> 01:22:04.794
It is the part of the puzzle
where you take the photo,

01:22:04.794 --> 01:22:06.960
you bring it into the
computer, and you finalize it.

01:22:06.960 --> 01:22:08.510
You make it look pretty.

01:22:08.510 --> 01:22:13.150
You hide the trick
that made it work.

01:22:13.150 --> 01:22:16.677
And so I have a bunch of
behind-the-scene images

01:22:16.677 --> 01:22:17.510
of before and after.

01:22:17.510 --> 01:22:19.260
This was a shoot that
I just talked to you

01:22:19.260 --> 01:22:21.930
guys about shooting an
underwater shipwreck in Bali.

01:22:21.930 --> 01:22:23.950
And this is the
before and after.

01:22:23.950 --> 01:22:25.700
So you start off
with an image where--

01:22:25.700 --> 01:22:26.465
if you guys shoot
underwater, you

01:22:26.465 --> 01:22:28.720
know it desaturates everything,
gets rid of all the color,

01:22:28.720 --> 01:22:31.250
so you end up with this really,
really bland color palette.

01:22:31.250 --> 01:22:32.791
And you just clean
it up, getting rid

01:22:32.791 --> 01:22:35.072
of different elements,
distracting elements.

01:22:35.072 --> 01:22:37.030
You can transform an
image from being something

01:22:37.030 --> 01:22:40.117
mediocre into something
absolutely phenomenal.

01:22:40.117 --> 01:22:41.700
Here's the same shot
that I showed you

01:22:41.700 --> 01:22:43.550
guys of the underwater
black lights

01:22:43.550 --> 01:22:45.744
of the guys floating
on top of the water.

01:22:45.744 --> 01:22:47.160
And we start off
with, once again,

01:22:47.160 --> 01:22:49.220
an image that you get as
close to reality as possible.

01:22:49.220 --> 01:22:50.730
Here you can notice
that even in the mouth,

01:22:50.730 --> 01:22:53.230
we took these pieces of cloth
that we put onto their tongues

01:22:53.230 --> 01:22:54.965
to give them a little
bit of definition,

01:22:54.965 --> 01:22:56.590
but we didn't actually
manage to get it

01:22:56.590 --> 01:22:58.110
all right in the right places.

01:22:58.110 --> 01:22:59.776
But then just cleaning
it out, you still

01:22:59.776 --> 01:23:02.517
go from the same image before
to cleaning out to after.

01:23:02.517 --> 01:23:04.600
So you still start off
with something really cool,

01:23:04.600 --> 01:23:06.100
and you make it better.

01:23:06.100 --> 01:23:08.689
National Slovak Theatre
off in Slovakia.

01:23:08.689 --> 01:23:09.480
We have this image.

01:23:09.480 --> 01:23:11.840
The pose is interesting, the
lighting is pretty dynamic,

01:23:11.840 --> 01:23:13.080
but, unfortunately,
you have one side

01:23:13.080 --> 01:23:15.121
that's way better than
the other, the side that's

01:23:15.121 --> 01:23:17.712
relatively dark, and the floor
needs a little bit of cleaning.

01:23:17.712 --> 01:23:20.170
So what happens when you just
clean all these elements out?

01:23:20.170 --> 01:23:22.128
Then the photo goes from
looking like something

01:23:22.128 --> 01:23:24.045
that is pretty cool,
which looks like a photo,

01:23:24.045 --> 01:23:26.211
to something that suddenly
becomes a little bit more

01:23:26.211 --> 01:23:27.340
like an illustration.

01:23:27.340 --> 01:23:28.320
On top of that, you
can give the guy

01:23:28.320 --> 01:23:29.736
more biceps, which
is always good.

01:23:29.736 --> 01:23:32.930
[LAUGHTER]

01:23:32.930 --> 01:23:36.025
We take the same photo of
the shipwreck that I did.

01:23:36.025 --> 01:23:37.400
And you'll notice--
I don't know,

01:23:37.400 --> 01:23:39.775
you've already seen the after
picture, but you'll notice,

01:23:39.775 --> 01:23:41.880
this one, the before
is a pretty picture,

01:23:41.880 --> 01:23:43.770
but there's still things that
are really, really distracting.

01:23:43.770 --> 01:23:45.980
The red of the lantern
immediately pops your eye,

01:23:45.980 --> 01:23:48.749
because it's so red, it's
out of the color palette

01:23:48.749 --> 01:23:49.790
of the rest of the image.

01:23:49.790 --> 01:23:50.498
So it stands out.

01:23:50.498 --> 01:23:51.651
It looks crappy.

01:23:51.651 --> 01:23:52.150
Her hand.

01:23:52.150 --> 01:23:53.192
Her hand is white.

01:23:53.192 --> 01:23:55.150
We see the hand right
away, we ignore the face.

01:23:55.150 --> 01:23:55.350
Why?

01:23:55.350 --> 01:23:56.010
Because it's white.

01:23:56.010 --> 01:23:56.740
It's in the center of the frame.

01:23:56.740 --> 01:23:58.280
It's attracting a
lot of attention.

01:23:58.280 --> 01:23:58.874
There's hair.

01:23:58.874 --> 01:24:01.040
There's lines of water
streaming the wrong direction

01:24:01.040 --> 01:24:01.620
across the hair.

01:24:01.620 --> 01:24:01.790
Why?

01:24:01.790 --> 01:24:02.780
Because I thought it
would be a good idea

01:24:02.780 --> 01:24:04.030
to toss some water up.

01:24:04.030 --> 01:24:05.350
It went the wrong direction.

01:24:05.350 --> 01:24:06.210
So at the end of the
day, just getting

01:24:06.210 --> 01:24:07.610
rid of all of
these details-- oh,

01:24:07.610 --> 01:24:10.430
and making her
butt smaller-- are

01:24:10.430 --> 01:24:13.240
things that really
make the shot go

01:24:13.240 --> 01:24:16.100
from looking pretty to looking
almost like an illustration.

01:24:16.100 --> 01:24:17.849
But there's nothing
really fancy about it.

01:24:17.849 --> 01:24:21.310
You start with an image that's
as close to reality as possible

01:24:21.310 --> 01:24:22.102
and make it better.

01:24:22.102 --> 01:24:24.226
And of course, you have
images like this one, which

01:24:24.226 --> 01:24:25.940
was shot at Disney
Concert Hall in LA,

01:24:25.940 --> 01:24:28.219
where you're imposed the
restrictions of the location.

01:24:28.219 --> 01:24:30.260
In this case, we weren't
allowed to have tripods.

01:24:30.260 --> 01:24:30.926
So what we'd do?

01:24:30.926 --> 01:24:33.362
I had this guy-- hefty
dude with a white shirt--

01:24:33.362 --> 01:24:34.570
and he was my human soft box.

01:24:34.570 --> 01:24:36.270
We put a flash instead
of his t-shirt,

01:24:36.270 --> 01:24:37.811
and we have this
light just streaming

01:24:37.811 --> 01:24:40.190
in from the side to light
up my main subjects.

01:24:40.190 --> 01:24:42.681
Now because we had a
human soft box, well,

01:24:42.681 --> 01:24:44.430
we couldn't actually
flag it off properly,

01:24:44.430 --> 01:24:45.920
so you can see that
huge flare just bleeding

01:24:45.920 --> 01:24:47.180
into the side of the image.

01:24:47.180 --> 01:24:49.240
Doesn't actually work too well.

01:24:49.240 --> 01:24:51.446
But then by cleaning
this all up,

01:24:51.446 --> 01:24:53.070
by getting rid of
all the distractions,

01:24:53.070 --> 01:24:56.240
by cleaning up that floor,
where all the different things,

01:24:56.240 --> 01:24:58.180
by enhancing the colors
and the contrast,

01:24:58.180 --> 01:25:01.320
your same image, which you've
gotten as close to as possible

01:25:01.320 --> 01:25:03.840
in camera, now
looks even better.

01:25:03.840 --> 01:25:06.990
And the part that I
spent the most time on

01:25:06.990 --> 01:25:08.570
was just polishing
the floor, which

01:25:08.570 --> 01:25:09.820
is the most boring thing ever.

01:25:09.820 --> 01:25:12.680
It's like actually cleaning a
floor, except on a computer.

01:25:12.680 --> 01:25:15.440
It sucks.

01:25:15.440 --> 01:25:17.160
But the thing that
people always imagine

01:25:17.160 --> 01:25:18.440
when they think
Photoshop is they

01:25:18.440 --> 01:25:20.280
think images like this,
where you take, wow,

01:25:20.280 --> 01:25:21.986
look this big, banging effect.

01:25:21.986 --> 01:25:24.360
But the sad part is, when you
look at an image like this,

01:25:24.360 --> 01:25:26.500
you know it's Photoshopped
right away, right?

01:25:26.500 --> 01:25:28.150
Because you know
it's not possible.

01:25:28.150 --> 01:25:29.390
So the illusion is lost.

01:25:29.390 --> 01:25:31.140
And this was shot--
it's super easy to do.

01:25:31.140 --> 01:25:33.060
It looks super impressive,
super easy to do.

01:25:33.060 --> 01:25:33.620
No lighting.

01:25:33.620 --> 01:25:36.940
We were in an abandoned
building-- big top, no roof,

01:25:36.940 --> 01:25:39.310
light streaming in, having
guy jump off the ladder.

01:25:39.310 --> 01:25:40.530
Took three shots--
one with a shirt,

01:25:40.530 --> 01:25:41.810
one with a t-shirt,
one without a shirt--

01:25:41.810 --> 01:25:43.850
this was the one I
retained-- and we just

01:25:43.850 --> 01:25:46.024
tossed all these objects
up in different places,

01:25:46.024 --> 01:25:47.690
and just kind of
pasted them into place.

01:25:47.690 --> 01:25:48.500
Simple compositing.

01:25:48.500 --> 01:25:49.750
There's nothing
really fancy about it.

01:25:49.750 --> 01:25:51.083
It was a very, very simple edit.

01:25:51.083 --> 01:25:54.469
I think it took less than
an hour to put together.

01:25:54.469 --> 01:25:56.260
And I think, really,
at the end of the day,

01:25:56.260 --> 01:25:57.870
images are supposed
to be enhanced.

01:25:57.870 --> 01:25:59.786
Like Photoshop is really
that tool to enhance.

01:25:59.786 --> 01:26:01.650
You try really hard to
get something close.

01:26:01.650 --> 01:26:04.485
This is me breathing fire,
except that the magic is

01:26:04.485 --> 01:26:06.360
a little bit lost,
because you see the torch,

01:26:06.360 --> 01:26:07.410
you see the source of the flame.

01:26:07.410 --> 01:26:09.940
You see where it's coming from,
which gets rid of the magic.

01:26:09.940 --> 01:26:11.606
The fire is also not
big enough, and you

01:26:11.606 --> 01:26:13.790
know, we like things
nice and big and poufy.

01:26:13.790 --> 01:26:17.007
So just by taking that
same transform tool,

01:26:17.007 --> 01:26:18.840
putting it in different
places, you can come

01:26:18.840 --> 01:26:20.210
and you can make a
shot that looks really

01:26:20.210 --> 01:26:21.585
good to start with
into something

01:26:21.585 --> 01:26:23.190
that looks absolutely amazing.

01:26:23.190 --> 01:26:26.060
And it's not complicated, it's
just about seeing the image

01:26:26.060 --> 01:26:27.779
and knowing what to get rid of.

01:26:27.779 --> 01:26:29.320
And of course,
removing the mistakes.

01:26:29.320 --> 01:26:31.590
Things that you do-- you know,
in the middle of the shoots,

01:26:31.590 --> 01:26:32.480
things that you
can't get rid of,

01:26:32.480 --> 01:26:35.044
like your assistants shooting
from behind the pillar.

01:26:35.044 --> 01:26:36.210
Really big pain in the butt.

01:26:36.210 --> 01:26:38.230
You still have to be
able to edit them.

01:26:38.230 --> 01:26:39.688
And you can enhance
your image, you

01:26:39.688 --> 01:26:41.860
can make it better using
these simple tools.

01:26:45.120 --> 01:26:47.214
And then like I said,
this is that shot

01:26:47.214 --> 01:26:48.630
that I talked about
really, really

01:26:48.630 --> 01:26:51.600
quickly about The
Agonists, where you really

01:26:51.600 --> 01:26:53.350
try to get as close
as possible in camera,

01:26:53.350 --> 01:26:55.800
because it means that you
have less work to do in post.

01:26:55.800 --> 01:26:57.620
All these little
fancy effects that we

01:26:57.620 --> 01:27:00.444
did-- all the sparks, all
the lighting, all that stuff

01:27:00.444 --> 01:27:02.360
was time consuming, but
it wasn't complicated.

01:27:02.360 --> 01:27:05.250
It was just about taking
faces from the image,

01:27:05.250 --> 01:27:07.070
putting them into
the little screens,

01:27:07.070 --> 01:27:10.470
taking these little sparks, and
stacking them up here and there

01:27:10.470 --> 01:27:12.430
just to make the image
a lot more elaborate.

01:27:12.430 --> 01:27:15.174
It doesn't matter what level
of complexity the image is.

01:27:15.174 --> 01:27:16.590
It's the same tools
that you apply

01:27:16.590 --> 01:27:18.990
over and over and over again.

01:27:18.990 --> 01:27:19.550
Right?

01:27:19.550 --> 01:27:21.390
So there's three
simple rules to follow.

01:27:21.390 --> 01:27:23.190
And I think that if
you follow these rules,

01:27:23.190 --> 01:27:25.065
and you apply it to any
level of photography,

01:27:25.065 --> 01:27:27.900
it will really help
make them better.

01:27:27.900 --> 01:27:30.477
And the three rules are number
one, removing distractions.

01:27:30.477 --> 01:27:32.060
Number two, paying
attention to color,

01:27:32.060 --> 01:27:34.560
and number three, darkening
things that are unimportant.

01:27:34.560 --> 01:27:38.644
The first removing distractions
is very, very simple.

01:27:38.644 --> 01:27:40.310
It's the idea of
getting rid of anything

01:27:40.310 --> 01:27:41.640
that you don't need in an image.

01:27:41.640 --> 01:27:43.230
So if you look at this
picture right here,

01:27:43.230 --> 01:27:44.950
there are a bunch of elements
that are completely useless.

01:27:44.950 --> 01:27:47.860
We have one, the bald spot
behind the grandmother's head.

01:27:47.860 --> 01:27:49.905
We have two, the garbage bins.

01:27:49.905 --> 01:27:52.030
They set you into the
present, because garbage bins

01:27:52.030 --> 01:27:53.330
are a present thing.

01:27:53.330 --> 01:27:56.876
We have that weird pole going
through the lampshade, which

01:27:56.876 --> 01:27:58.250
you don't really
know what it is.

01:27:58.250 --> 01:28:00.150
That tree line I also think
is completely useless,

01:28:00.150 --> 01:28:02.024
because it doesn't
transport us anywhere new.

01:28:02.024 --> 01:28:04.920
It doesn't tell us any
more where the location is,

01:28:04.920 --> 01:28:06.450
doesn't make it
more exotic or not.

01:28:06.450 --> 01:28:08.116
So getting rid of all
these distractions

01:28:08.116 --> 01:28:09.630
and smoothing the
whole thing out

01:28:09.630 --> 01:28:11.046
takes your image
of something that

01:28:11.046 --> 01:28:13.850
is pretty into something
that is completely polished.

01:28:13.850 --> 01:28:15.820
Because now, when you
look at the image,

01:28:15.820 --> 01:28:18.540
your eye immediately goes
straight to the girl.

01:28:18.540 --> 01:28:21.797
It follows the line down
to the couple watching,

01:28:21.797 --> 01:28:23.880
and then it straps up, and
you notice where it is.

01:28:23.880 --> 01:28:26.029
Because of the lamppost,
you know it's European.

01:28:26.029 --> 01:28:27.570
You know there's
ballerinas, you know

01:28:27.570 --> 01:28:28.350
there's people watching it.

01:28:28.350 --> 01:28:28.980
It's almost like a show.

01:28:28.980 --> 01:28:30.646
You complete the story
in your own head,

01:28:30.646 --> 01:28:32.560
because now there are
no more distractions,

01:28:32.560 --> 01:28:34.250
because you can automatically
just kind of piece

01:28:34.250 --> 01:28:35.041
all these together.

01:28:35.041 --> 01:28:37.050
This maybe looks a
little bit more posed.

01:28:37.050 --> 01:28:39.450
Right?

01:28:39.450 --> 01:28:42.020
Paying attention to color is
also really, really important.

01:28:42.020 --> 01:28:44.010
I have this shot from the
Underwater Realm with no color

01:28:44.010 --> 01:28:44.670
in.

01:28:44.670 --> 01:28:46.961
And you can see, even though
all the characters are all

01:28:46.961 --> 01:28:49.650
placed in the right
place, which is great,

01:28:49.650 --> 01:28:50.650
it doesn't look magical.

01:28:50.650 --> 01:28:53.080
It doesn't transport you.

01:28:53.080 --> 01:28:55.330
But the minute you start
playing around with lighting,

01:28:55.330 --> 01:28:57.720
you say, OK, well, the most
important part of this image

01:28:57.720 --> 01:28:59.255
is what's happening
in the center.

01:28:59.255 --> 01:29:01.780
So let's lighten it up.

01:29:01.780 --> 01:29:04.339
Your shot's already a
little bit more interesting.

01:29:04.339 --> 01:29:05.880
But now even though
it's interesting,

01:29:05.880 --> 01:29:09.530
it still doesn't feel complete,
because the color's not there.

01:29:09.530 --> 01:29:12.580
And because like I said earlier,
when you shoot underwater,

01:29:12.580 --> 01:29:13.946
it eats all of the color out.

01:29:13.946 --> 01:29:15.820
When you add the color
back in, then suddenly

01:29:15.820 --> 01:29:17.084
your image becomes complete.

01:29:17.084 --> 01:29:19.500
And it's just a question of
adding a little bit of oranges

01:29:19.500 --> 01:29:19.700
in.

01:29:19.700 --> 01:29:21.949
And the reason why it's
orange is because it gives you

01:29:21.949 --> 01:29:26.422
that kind of sensation
of sunlight streaming in.

01:29:26.422 --> 01:29:28.740
Right?

01:29:28.740 --> 01:29:30.350
AUDIENCE: So part
of the failures

01:29:30.350 --> 01:29:34.040
that I might think that
you probably have run into

01:29:34.040 --> 01:29:37.920
is have you ever come
across moments of dry spells

01:29:37.920 --> 01:29:40.570
in creativity,
where you just can't

01:29:40.570 --> 01:29:43.250
form that story that
you're interested in?

01:29:43.250 --> 01:29:44.570
BEN VON WONG: Yeah.

01:29:44.570 --> 01:29:45.070
Definitely.

01:29:45.070 --> 01:29:47.630
Yeah, definitely it's
one of those things that

01:29:47.630 --> 01:29:51.684
happens, where you
aren't quite inspired,

01:29:51.684 --> 01:29:54.100
and you don't really know what
you want to create anymore,

01:29:54.100 --> 01:29:55.308
and you can't create anymore.

01:29:55.308 --> 01:29:58.960
And I think that the solution,
when those times invariably

01:29:58.960 --> 01:30:02.980
do come forward, is to just
keep doing the things that

01:30:02.980 --> 01:30:06.092
make you happy, to force
things back to the present.

01:30:06.092 --> 01:30:07.800
So it's normal as a
creative-- especially

01:30:07.800 --> 01:30:09.990
you have these really high
ups and these low downs,

01:30:09.990 --> 01:30:11.990
and it comes up and down--
that you don't really

01:30:11.990 --> 01:30:13.845
know what you're trying to do.

01:30:13.845 --> 01:30:16.627
But when you just do the things
that you enjoy-- for example,

01:30:16.627 --> 01:30:18.960
in my case, that's meeting
new people, that's traveling,

01:30:18.960 --> 01:30:22.420
that's going to new places--
even if I don't feel inspired,

01:30:22.420 --> 01:30:24.260
and I just put myself
into these situations

01:30:24.260 --> 01:30:26.487
where I'm doing the
things that I love to do,

01:30:26.487 --> 01:30:28.070
then the inspiration
kind of gradually

01:30:28.070 --> 01:30:30.319
follows along the way,
because it has to.

01:30:30.319 --> 01:30:32.110
When you're doing the
things that you like,

01:30:32.110 --> 01:30:33.870
even if you don't
really feel like them,

01:30:33.870 --> 01:30:35.245
it's almost like
putting yourself

01:30:35.245 --> 01:30:36.869
in a room with a
bunch of happy people.

01:30:36.869 --> 01:30:38.620
You're eventually
going to start smiling.

01:30:38.620 --> 01:30:41.160
So I think it's that
very simple idea.

01:30:41.160 --> 01:30:43.520
But if you don't feel inspired,
and every day you just

01:30:43.520 --> 01:30:45.250
stay at home and lock
yourself in a room

01:30:45.250 --> 01:30:47.500
and go to sleep or watch
TV, then that inspiration

01:30:47.500 --> 01:30:49.877
is probably going to be a lot
harder to come back to you.

01:30:49.877 --> 01:30:51.960
Whereas if you're doing
the things that you enjoy,

01:30:51.960 --> 01:30:54.140
it helps a little bit more.

01:30:54.140 --> 01:30:54.680
That's cool?

01:30:54.680 --> 01:30:55.180
All right.

01:30:55.180 --> 01:30:56.520
I'm going to move forward
in my presentation

01:30:56.520 --> 01:30:58.050
so that I can finish
it, and then we

01:30:58.050 --> 01:30:59.550
can hang out and
ask questions, even

01:30:59.550 --> 01:31:00.400
though you don't have a lot.

01:31:00.400 --> 01:31:02.400
So darkening things that
are unimportant I think

01:31:02.400 --> 01:31:05.190
is a very important thing.

01:31:05.190 --> 01:31:07.370
And I have this image over
here, because you still

01:31:07.370 --> 01:31:09.370
start with an image that,
at the end of the day,

01:31:09.370 --> 01:31:10.570
looks pretty good.

01:31:10.570 --> 01:31:12.370
But when you look at
the image, there's

01:31:12.370 --> 01:31:14.810
still distractions
along on the way.

01:31:14.810 --> 01:31:17.610
You don't really know how to
read the image, because you

01:31:17.610 --> 01:31:19.527
have those really bright
patches in the front,

01:31:19.527 --> 01:31:21.318
you have a lot of bright
patches coming in,

01:31:21.318 --> 01:31:23.837
because the sun was streaming
in and we only had two lights.

01:31:23.837 --> 01:31:25.420
But when you darken
things out and you

01:31:25.420 --> 01:31:26.960
just even out the
lighting, then suddenly

01:31:26.960 --> 01:31:28.584
that story becomes
a lot more apparent.

01:31:28.584 --> 01:31:30.740
You control the
viewer experience

01:31:30.740 --> 01:31:32.690
by simply controlling
the lighting.

01:31:32.690 --> 01:31:34.690
And then suddenly by darkening
things that aren't important,

01:31:34.690 --> 01:31:36.010
that you don't want
to call attention to,

01:31:36.010 --> 01:31:37.510
it still sets the
tone and the mood

01:31:37.510 --> 01:31:39.400
and the location
of the whole shoot

01:31:39.400 --> 01:31:41.284
without affecting the
rest of the image.

01:31:41.284 --> 01:31:43.700
And the reason why there's a
little start at the end of it

01:31:43.700 --> 01:31:46.470
is because the only
time that wouldn't apply

01:31:46.470 --> 01:31:47.960
is when it's a high key image.

01:31:47.960 --> 01:31:49.835
And if you take an image
like this one, which

01:31:49.835 --> 01:31:51.240
was shot at a
wedding seminar, we

01:31:51.240 --> 01:31:53.705
have to get rid of
distractions, once again.

01:31:53.705 --> 01:31:55.330
And you look at it,
and you're like OK,

01:31:55.330 --> 01:31:58.647
it's really a mediocre
location, which it was.

01:31:58.647 --> 01:31:59.730
How do you make it better?

01:31:59.730 --> 01:32:01.330
Well, if you clean
up all the areas

01:32:01.330 --> 01:32:03.300
and you make things
brighter, that same image

01:32:03.300 --> 01:32:06.750
can go from looking very mundane
into looking really, really

01:32:06.750 --> 01:32:08.644
clean.

01:32:08.644 --> 01:32:11.060
Even if you look at this image,
well, I kind of screwed up

01:32:11.060 --> 01:32:12.851
because I forgot to
brighten the reflection

01:32:12.851 --> 01:32:16.552
on the bottom, the reflection on
the tiles, but it still works.

01:32:16.552 --> 01:32:18.760
It's still cleaned up the
image, because now, there's

01:32:18.760 --> 01:32:20.010
nothing else to distract you.

01:32:20.010 --> 01:32:22.260
You just see front and
center the main model,

01:32:22.260 --> 01:32:24.344
because all the other
stuff has been blown away.

01:32:24.344 --> 01:32:26.260
So those are the three
simple rules to follow.

01:32:26.260 --> 01:32:28.790
And the good news about
these three simple rules

01:32:28.790 --> 01:32:31.390
is that they work in
just about any context.

01:32:31.390 --> 01:32:33.260
So we have this photo
over here, which

01:32:33.260 --> 01:32:36.300
is of the medieval shoot, which,
incidentally, is a photo that I

01:32:36.300 --> 01:32:39.240
really dislike, because it
just took hours of Photoshop

01:32:39.240 --> 01:32:39.820
to fix up.

01:32:39.820 --> 01:32:41.236
The original image
actually looked

01:32:41.236 --> 01:32:42.740
like this, which
is a complete mess.

01:32:42.740 --> 01:32:44.350
You look at it, you have
no idea what's going on.

01:32:44.350 --> 01:32:45.920
It looks like a tavern brawl.

01:32:45.920 --> 01:32:49.770
And the reason is because
the lighting wasn't done.

01:32:49.770 --> 01:32:52.025
I thought that if I put one
light up over to the left

01:32:52.025 --> 01:32:53.900
and I put another light
up over to the right,

01:32:53.900 --> 01:32:56.500
I would kind of create this nice
cross-lighting set up, which

01:32:56.500 --> 01:32:58.100
would create a spotlight
effect on the characters

01:32:58.100 --> 01:33:00.599
in the center, and then if I
popped a whole bunch of strobes

01:33:00.599 --> 01:33:05.280
in the background, then it
would kind of rim the existing

01:33:05.280 --> 01:33:07.220
characters and it
would look really cool.

01:33:07.220 --> 01:33:08.630
I was completely wrong.

01:33:08.630 --> 01:33:11.084
But I had 50 people
waiting after me to model

01:33:11.084 --> 01:33:12.500
and wondering why
it was taking me

01:33:12.500 --> 01:33:16.480
so long to press my button on my
camera while they were posing.

01:33:16.480 --> 01:33:19.660
So at the end of the day, I
just had to take the shot,

01:33:19.660 --> 01:33:22.190
and I told myself
I'd fix it in post.

01:33:22.190 --> 01:33:24.460
And I originally
knew that I was going

01:33:24.460 --> 01:33:25.960
to add these two
jumping characters.

01:33:25.960 --> 01:33:28.126
So this is kind of the shot
that I started off with.

01:33:28.126 --> 01:33:31.465
You can see it's absolutely
illegible, impossible to read.

01:33:31.465 --> 01:33:33.350
You have no idea
what's going on.

01:33:33.350 --> 01:33:35.820
So in applying those same
rules into this image, which

01:33:35.820 --> 01:33:37.856
is desaturating and
darkening the things that

01:33:37.856 --> 01:33:39.230
aren't important,
you can already

01:33:39.230 --> 01:33:41.850
notice how big of a
difference that makes just

01:33:41.850 --> 01:33:44.560
by getting rid of all those
really bright spots that

01:33:44.560 --> 01:33:45.650
served no purpose.

01:33:45.650 --> 01:33:48.110
The image suddenly starts to
stand out at the right place.

01:33:48.110 --> 01:33:49.610
We know that the
center of the image

01:33:49.610 --> 01:33:51.097
is the most important part.

01:33:51.097 --> 01:33:52.680
The characters are
the most important.

01:33:52.680 --> 01:33:55.190
We fill up all the holes
from a composition standpoint

01:33:55.190 --> 01:33:57.020
to make sure that all
the characters are

01:33:57.020 --> 01:33:58.610
in the right place
at the right time,

01:33:58.610 --> 01:34:00.401
and then you suddenly
have this nice spiral

01:34:00.401 --> 01:34:03.772
that is framing the
center of our image.

01:34:03.772 --> 01:34:05.730
From there we have light,
contrast, and colors.

01:34:05.730 --> 01:34:07.790
So what I was saying about
making the center just

01:34:07.790 --> 01:34:10.164
a little bit brighter to draw
a little bit more attention

01:34:10.164 --> 01:34:12.580
into the middle was going to
be really, really critical

01:34:12.580 --> 01:34:14.600
to making the shot look
a little bit better.

01:34:14.600 --> 01:34:15.620
And then I reached
this point where I just

01:34:15.620 --> 01:34:16.870
didn't know what to do
anymore, because I was like,

01:34:16.870 --> 01:34:18.420
OK, well I got pretty far.

01:34:18.420 --> 01:34:20.849
It's looking pretty good, but
it still looks like a mess.

01:34:20.849 --> 01:34:22.390
I started to think
about what I could

01:34:22.390 --> 01:34:24.725
do to make it at least
stand out a little bit more.

01:34:24.725 --> 01:34:26.850
And I figured that, what
do they do in video games?

01:34:26.850 --> 01:34:28.391
Well, all the
characters are glowing,

01:34:28.391 --> 01:34:29.910
so why don't I just
make them glow?

01:34:29.910 --> 01:34:30.810
So I made all the
characters glow.

01:34:30.810 --> 01:34:32.970
And now suddenly it looks like
a completely fantastical scene.

01:34:32.970 --> 01:34:35.303
It doesn't make perfect sense
from a completely physical

01:34:35.303 --> 01:34:40.100
standpoint, but it does actually
look like a legible image.

01:34:40.100 --> 01:34:42.190
You can kind of understand
what is going on,

01:34:42.190 --> 01:34:43.900
and it's not too bad.

01:34:43.900 --> 01:34:45.370
And unfortunately,
what this means

01:34:45.370 --> 01:34:48.030
is that you end up with
a bazillion layers,

01:34:48.030 --> 01:34:49.045
bazillion hours of work.

01:34:49.045 --> 01:34:50.080
So, 40 hours of work.

01:34:50.080 --> 01:34:52.620
And you'll notice that in the
beginning of my presentation

01:34:52.620 --> 01:34:54.960
where I was talking about
why I love photography,

01:34:54.960 --> 01:34:57.168
at no point did I say sitting
in front of my computer

01:34:57.168 --> 01:34:58.830
alone for 40 hours.

01:34:58.830 --> 01:35:00.401
So that is one of
the reasons why

01:35:00.401 --> 01:35:02.150
I love to just get out
there and do things

01:35:02.150 --> 01:35:04.830
as much as possible in camera,
so I don't need to end up

01:35:04.830 --> 01:35:06.934
in this situation over here.

01:35:06.934 --> 01:35:08.600
So in conclusion,
what I'm trying to say

01:35:08.600 --> 01:35:11.724
is that photography is
really about these splits.

01:35:11.724 --> 01:35:13.890
You have 33% that's really
about the pre-production,

01:35:13.890 --> 01:35:17.320
about getting all the
elements right beforehand,

01:35:17.320 --> 01:35:19.829
so that when you do your
shoot, which is the next 33%,

01:35:19.829 --> 01:35:21.370
you can actually do
a good job, apply

01:35:21.370 --> 01:35:23.180
all the technical
knowledge you have.

01:35:23.180 --> 01:35:25.710
And then the last 33% is
really the post-production side

01:35:25.710 --> 01:35:28.700
of things, where you sit down
and you fix, you iron things

01:35:28.700 --> 01:35:30.622
out, and you complete the job.

01:35:30.622 --> 01:35:32.330
And now the good news
is you don't really

01:35:32.330 --> 01:35:35.061
need to be great at
all the three above.

01:35:35.061 --> 01:35:36.560
If you suck at
pre-production, well,

01:35:36.560 --> 01:35:38.143
you can be a really
great photographer

01:35:38.143 --> 01:35:40.860
and compensate for it, or be
really great at post-production

01:35:40.860 --> 01:35:42.689
if you suck at shooting
and pre-production.

01:35:42.689 --> 01:35:44.480
You can compensate for
all of these things.

01:35:44.480 --> 01:35:45.938
So it's just one
of these balances,

01:35:45.938 --> 01:35:49.100
and you need to figure out
which point do you stand?

01:35:49.100 --> 01:35:52.170
What is the balance
that you want to be?

01:35:52.170 --> 01:35:55.360
So in conclusion, "Choose
a job that you love,

01:35:55.360 --> 01:35:57.520
and you'll never have to
work a day in your life."

01:35:57.520 --> 01:35:58.942
Confucius.

01:35:58.942 --> 01:36:00.280
That is it.

01:36:00.280 --> 01:36:00.880
The end.

01:36:00.880 --> 01:36:05.130
