but let me go back to these sines

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829
but let me go back to these sines
 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.639
but let me go back to these sines
cosines and logarithms well actually if

they are ways to show you how these

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:00.499
they are ways to show you how these
 

00:01:00.499 --> 00:01:03.919
they are ways to show you how these
basic building blocks of reasoning can

basic building blocks of reasoning can
 

00:01:03.929 --> 00:01:06.590
basic building blocks of reasoning can
be used to deduce surprising things or

difficult things in some sense they're
 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.690
difficult things in some sense they're
like the historical coverages of the

these famous theorems now I actually
 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.260
these famous theorems now I actually
think that these are accessible to

reason mathematics is difficult to

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630
reason mathematics is difficult to
 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.600
reason mathematics is difficult to
understand it's actually because of that

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610
understand it's actually because of that
 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.210
understand it's actually because of that
network of prerequisites you see math is

one of these strange subjects for which

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200
one of these strange subjects for which
 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.790
one of these strange subjects for which
the concepts are chained in sequences of

the concepts are chained in sequences of
 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:39.920
the concepts are chained in sequences of
dependency when you have long chains

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930
dependency when you have long chains
 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.500
dependency when you have long chains
there are very few starting points very

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:42.510
there are very few starting points very
 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:44.690
there are very few starting points very
few things I need to memorize I don't

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700
few things I need to memorize I don't
 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.370
few things I need to memorize I don't
need to memorize for example all these

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380
need to memorize for example all these
 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.170
need to memorize for example all these
things in history such as when was the

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180
things in history such as when was the
 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.190
things in history such as when was the
war of 1812

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200
war of 1812
 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.480
war of 1812
well actually I know that one because

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490
well actually I know that one because
 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.220
well actually I know that one because
that's a math fact it was 1812 but I

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:52.230
that's a math fact it was 1812 but I
 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:53.690
that's a math fact it was 1812 but I
can't tell you a lot of other facts

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700
can't tell you a lot of other facts
 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.610
can't tell you a lot of other facts
which are just purely memorized in

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:55.620
which are just purely memorized in
 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:57.440
which are just purely memorized in
mathematics you're very few that you

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450
mathematics you're very few that you
 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.420
mathematics you're very few that you
memorize and the rest you deduce as you

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430
memorize and the rest you deduce as you
 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.670
memorize and the rest you deduce as you
go through and this chain of deductions

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680
go through and this chain of deductions
 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.550
go through and this chain of deductions
is actually what's critical now let me

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560
is actually what's critical now let me
 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.140
is actually what's critical now let me
contrast that with other subjects like

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:06.150
contrast that with other subjects like
 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:07.790
contrast that with other subjects like
say history history doesn't have this

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:07.800
say history history doesn't have this
 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.370
say history history doesn't have this
long chain in fact if you fully

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:10.380
long chain in fact if you fully
 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:11.900
long chain in fact if you fully
understand the war of 1812

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910
understand the war of 1812
 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.780
understand the war of 1812
that's great and

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790
that's great and
 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:14.920
that's great and
it is true that that will influence

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930
it is true that that will influence
 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:17.020
it is true that that will influence
perhaps your understanding later of the

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030
perhaps your understanding later of the
 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:19.020
perhaps your understanding later of the
women's movement but it won't be as

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030
women's movement but it won't be as
 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:21.789
women's movement but it won't be as
absolutely prerequisite in the sense

00:02:21.789 --> 00:02:21.799
absolutely prerequisite in the sense
 

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:23.349
absolutely prerequisite in the sense
that if you think about the concepts I

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:23.359
that if you think about the concepts I
 

00:02:23.359 --> 00:02:24.970
that if you think about the concepts I
actually think that history has more

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980
actually think that history has more
 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:26.800
actually think that history has more
concepts than mathematics it's just that

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810
concepts than mathematics it's just that
 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:28.420
concepts than mathematics it's just that
they're spread out broader and they

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430
they're spread out broader and they
 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:30.759
they're spread out broader and they
don't depend on each other as strongly

00:02:30.759 --> 00:02:30.769
don't depend on each other as strongly
 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:33.460
don't depend on each other as strongly
so for example if you miss a week you

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470
so for example if you miss a week you
 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:35.080
so for example if you miss a week you
will miss the understanding of one unit

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090
will miss the understanding of one unit
 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:37.479
will miss the understanding of one unit
but that won't that won't stop you from

00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:37.489
but that won't that won't stop you from
 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:38.860
but that won't that won't stop you from
understanding all of the rest of the

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870
understanding all of the rest of the
 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:41.050
understanding all of the rest of the
components so that's actually the

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060
components so that's actually the
 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:42.789
components so that's actually the
difference between math and other

00:02:42.789 --> 00:02:42.799
difference between math and other
 

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:43.959
difference between math and other
subjects in my head

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:43.969
subjects in my head
 

00:02:43.969 --> 00:02:46.119
subjects in my head
math has fewer concepts but they're

00:02:46.119 --> 00:02:46.129
math has fewer concepts but they're
 

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:48.069
math has fewer concepts but they're
change deeper and because of the way

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:48.079
change deeper and because of the way
 

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:50.020
change deeper and because of the way
that we usually learn when you have deep

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030
that we usually learn when you have deep
 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:51.879
that we usually learn when you have deep
chains it's very fragile because you

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:51.889
chains it's very fragile because you
 

00:02:51.889 --> 00:02:54.429
chains it's very fragile because you
lose any one link meaning if you miss a

00:02:54.429 --> 00:02:54.439
lose any one link meaning if you miss a
 

00:02:54.439 --> 00:02:56.319
lose any one link meaning if you miss a
few concepts along the chain you can

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:56.329
few concepts along the chain you can
 

00:02:56.329 --> 00:02:58.210
few concepts along the chain you can
actually be completely lost if for

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:58.220
actually be completely lost if for
 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:59.979
actually be completely lost if for
example you're sick for a week or if

00:02:59.979 --> 00:02:59.989
example you're sick for a week or if
 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:01.599
example you're sick for a week or if
your mind is somewhere else for a week

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:01.609
your mind is somewhere else for a week
 

00:03:01.609 --> 00:03:02.920
your mind is somewhere else for a week
you might make a hole in your

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:02.930
you might make a hole in your
 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:05.080
you might make a hole in your
prerequisites and the way that education

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.090
prerequisites and the way that education
 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:07.420
prerequisites and the way that education
often works where it's almost like

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:07.430
often works where it's almost like
 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:09.309
often works where it's almost like
riding a train from a beginning to an

riding a train from a beginning to an
 

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:11.080
riding a train from a beginning to an
end well it's such that if you have a

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090
end well it's such that if you have a
 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:12.819
end well it's such that if you have a
hole somewhere in your track the Train

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:12.829
hole somewhere in your track the Train
 

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:15.789

this is to provide a way for everyone to

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:19.940
this is to provide a way for everyone to
 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:22.270
this is to provide a way for everyone to
learn at their own pace and in fact to

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:22.280
learn at their own pace and in fact to
 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.159
learn at their own pace and in fact to
fill in the holes whenever they are

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:24.169
fill in the holes whenever they are
 

00:03:24.169 --> 00:03:25.839
fill in the holes whenever they are
sensed and I actually feel like if

00:03:25.839 --> 00:03:25.849
sensed and I actually feel like if
 

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:28.390

everyone was able to pick up every one

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:28.400
everyone was able to pick up every one
 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.069
everyone was able to pick up every one
of those prerequisites as necessary

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:30.079
of those prerequisites as necessary
 

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:31.330
of those prerequisites as necessary
filling in any gaps they have

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:31.340
filling in any gaps they have
 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:33.670
filling in any gaps they have
mathematics would change from being the

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:33.680
mathematics would change from being the
 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.520
mathematics would change from being the
hardest subject to the easiest subject I

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:36.530
hardest subject to the easiest subject I
 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:38.920
hardest subject to the easiest subject I
think everyone's a math person and all

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:38.930
think everyone's a math person and all
 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:40.719
think everyone's a math person and all
that one has to do is to go through the

00:03:40.719 --> 00:03:40.729
that one has to do is to go through the
 

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:42.309
that one has to do is to go through the
chain and fill in all the gaps and

00:03:42.309 --> 00:03:42.319
chain and fill in all the gaps and
 

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:44.020
chain and fill in all the gaps and
you'll understand it easier more better

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:44.030
you'll understand it easier more better
 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:46.790
you'll understand it easier more better
than all the other subjects actually

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:46.800
than all the other subjects actually
 

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:54.509
