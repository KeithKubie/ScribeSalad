00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:21.409
the answer to how you construct yourself
I think I remember when I was a little

00:00:21.409 --> 00:00:21.419
I think I remember when I was a little
 

00:00:21.419 --> 00:00:24.589
I think I remember when I was a little
girl I was about 7 or 8 and I had

00:00:24.589 --> 00:00:24.599
girl I was about 7 or 8 and I had
 

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:27.200
girl I was about 7 or 8 and I had
realized that I had not been myself in

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210
realized that I had not been myself in
 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:28.940
realized that I had not been myself in
my own head for so long that I didn't

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:28.950
my own head for so long that I didn't
 

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:30.799
my own head for so long that I didn't
remember what my own voice sounded like

00:00:30.799 --> 00:00:30.809
remember what my own voice sounded like
 

00:00:30.809 --> 00:00:32.450
remember what my own voice sounded like
in my head because I was always playing

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460
in my head because I was always playing
 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.819
in my head because I was always playing
in my head so then I thought where's my

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829
in my head so then I thought where's my
 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.400
in my head so then I thought where's my
voice and I had to actually invent my

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410
voice and I had to actually invent my
 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.740
voice and I had to actually invent my
own voice I had to make it up because I

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750
own voice I had to make it up because I
 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.170
own voice I had to make it up because I
didn't have a thinking voice you realize

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180
didn't have a thinking voice you realize
 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.400
didn't have a thinking voice you realize
that you just take for granted that you

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410
that you just take for granted that you
 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:44.720
that you just take for granted that you
have a thinking voice you think I'm

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730
have a thinking voice you think I'm
 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.340

and make what happens if that's for some
 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:51.890
and make what happens if that's for some
reason missing and that in my case was

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:51.900
reason missing and that in my case was
 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:53.630
reason missing and that in my case was

partly what the book is about is how in
 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.360
partly what the book is about is how in
a way the book is kind of constructed on

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:36.370
a way the book is kind of constructed on
 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:39.370
a way the book is kind of constructed on
an architecture of twin betrayals that's

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:39.380
an architecture of twin betrayals that's
 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:42.670
an architecture of twin betrayals that's
the architecture of the book and in a

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:42.680
the architecture of the book and in a
 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:46.660
the architecture of the book and in a
way a woman of 50 is looking back at her

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:46.670
way a woman of 50 is looking back at her
 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:50.410
way a woman of 50 is looking back at her
young 20 self and seeing a woman who

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:50.420
young 20 self and seeing a woman who
 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.110
young 20 self and seeing a woman who
betrayed somebody and actually caused

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:53.120
betrayed somebody and actually caused
 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:54.850
betrayed somebody and actually caused
them something terrible to happen

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:54.860
them something terrible to happen
 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:57.670
them something terrible to happen
through a betrayal a love a betrayal of

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:57.680
through a betrayal a love a betrayal of
 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.850
through a betrayal a love a betrayal of
love and then that same you know that

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:00.860
love and then that same you know that
 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:02.380
love and then that same you know that
same woman is then the same thing

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:02.390
same woman is then the same thing
 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:04.450
same woman is then the same thing
happens to her she is betrayed so it's

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:04.460
happens to her she is betrayed so it's
 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:06.040
happens to her she is betrayed so it's
like looking looking but she's looking

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:06.050
like looking looking but she's looking
 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:09.930
like looking looking but she's looking
like across the void at her younger self

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:09.940
like across the void at her younger self
 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:13.420
like across the void at her younger self

mean I think that you know memory is
 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:15.440
mean I think that you know memory is
very influenced by our unconscious as is
