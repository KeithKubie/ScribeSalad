00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.640
There is a lot of dating advice out there that doesn't make sense to me.

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:07.080
Always make sure you're the one to text him less.

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.460
So if he sends you two texts you send him one.

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:12.520
And if he sends you one text you send him one word answers.

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.740
If he's getting distant then you just tell him that he's being clingy and that you need space.

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.960
You just always have to reverse psychology them.

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:24.240
Here's a series of books of canned responses for every possible scenario

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.840
organized alphabetically by topic of discussion.

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.280
Thank you.. Yeah

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:31.500
I will... um.. get right on that

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.740
There's articles and books and movies and blogs and videos

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:38.960
All based purely on the concept that there is a right way to date someone.

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:43.240
That there is a correct combination of texts and words and behaviours

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:47.540
that will make somebody fall in love with you without you losing your power.

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:50.380
I think this is bullshit

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:53.920
And I mean don't get me wrong. I'll admit when I was fifteen I would read Cosmopolitan

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:57.000
and Seventeen magazine and follow their advice to a "T"

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:59.860
He's gonna call me now. He's gonna call me now. He's gonna call me now.

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:02.920
Now. Now. He's gonna call me now. He's... *gasps*

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:10.320
*phone ringing*

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.260
Hey Michael! I'm so sorry. I was just in the shower... All naked and stuff

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.280
What's up chicken butt?

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:22.260
But I realized that all of this advice is based on the flawed premise that

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.820
love is a game and people are prizes to be won.

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.440
And when I would follow these rules and inevitably get to know a person better

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:31.540
And become emotionally invested in them.

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:36.320
I would realize way too late. Wait! We're not actually compatible.

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:38.300
Yeah so I just like walked out.

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:40.500
Wait... You just left without paying?

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.840
Look if they're not going to give me the bill on time then I'm just gonna go.

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:45.940
Bye! *chuckles*

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:49.600
I remember when I was in like my late teens early twenties

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.660
I had like this really long conversation with my grandma where I was just like confused and angry

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:58.320
about love and marriage and dating and I just felt like there were so many rules you had to follow

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.960
And I had so much anxiety about doing the wrong thing or saying the wrong thing.

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:07.900
And she was like "Anna Kay. The only dating advice you will ever need is to just be yourself."

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:11.660
Because that way if someone falls in love with you, they're falling in love with you

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:14.100
And not this idea that you've presented.

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:18.780
It's a lot of work to maintain an idea over a long period of time.

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:20.960
It's quite easy to keep being yourself.

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:26.360
And her advice, though very simple, and straightforward and seemingly obvious really stuck with me.

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:30.600
As like a no bullshit way to see who's weirdness vibes with your weirdness.

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:33.515
Because if you're the kind of person who says whatever is on their mind

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:36.260
No matter how inappropriate or dark

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.640
Your date's gonna either laugh and like it or they're gonna think that it's awkward and never call you again.

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:45.040
But either way, you didn't hold back an aspect of your personality that you otherwise

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.740
might've suppressed for some time.

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:52.160
I think it's much better to just be upfront with who you are and what the other person is signing up for.

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:53.880
And if they like it - great!

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:57.040
And if they don't - cool! Move on and find somebody else.

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.160
And when you finally do they'll like you for you.

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:05.880
Instead of this carefully curated construct that you've spent so much time building for them.
