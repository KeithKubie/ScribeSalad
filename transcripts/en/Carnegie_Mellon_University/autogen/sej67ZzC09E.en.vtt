has been actively discussed quite a bit

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:36.710
has been actively discussed quite a bit
 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:38.229
has been actively discussed quite a bit
over the past two years the need for

00:00:38.229 --> 00:00:38.239
over the past two years the need for
 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:40.030
over the past two years the need for
water and what's called hydraulic

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:40.040
water and what's called hydraulic
 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:41.950
water and what's called hydraulic
fracturing the hydraulic that tells you

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:41.960
fracturing the hydraulic that tells you
 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:43.810
fracturing the hydraulic that tells you
its water and fracturing we're trying to

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:43.820
its water and fracturing we're trying to
 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:45.820
its water and fracturing we're trying to
break apart the shale so that the gas is

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:45.830
break apart the shale so that the gas is
 

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:48.009
break apart the shale so that the gas is
easier to release so when you do that

00:00:48.009 --> 00:00:48.019
easier to release so when you do that
 

00:00:48.019 --> 00:00:49.719
easier to release so when you do that
you use a lot of water and then you

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:49.729
you use a lot of water and then you
 

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:52.180
you use a lot of water and then you
produce a lot of waste water and much of

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:52.190
produce a lot of waste water and much of
 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:53.710
produce a lot of waste water and much of
my research has been on the end of

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:53.720
my research has been on the end of
 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:55.600
my research has been on the end of
what's that water like that comes back

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:55.610
what's that water like that comes back
 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:57.820
what's that water like that comes back
up and it comes up really really salty

00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:57.830
up and it comes up really really salty
 

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:00.219
up and it comes up really really salty
saltier than the ocean by like ten times

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:00.229
saltier than the ocean by like ten times
 

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:02.410
saltier than the ocean by like ten times
so what do you do with really really

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:02.420
so what do you do with really really
 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:04.930
so what do you do with really really
salty water so when you are extracting

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:04.940
salty water so when you are extracting
 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:06.850
salty water so when you are extracting
energy and producing these waste waters

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:06.860
energy and producing these waste waters
 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:08.590
energy and producing these waste waters
you have to think sort of three steps

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:08.600
you have to think sort of three steps
 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.690
you have to think sort of three steps
ahead that's really hard for us even as

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:10.700
ahead that's really hard for us even as
 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:11.770
ahead that's really hard for us even as
engineers it's hard for us to think

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:11.780
engineers it's hard for us to think
 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:13.810
engineers it's hard for us to think
three steps ahead what will happen to

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:13.820
three steps ahead what will happen to
 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:15.219
three steps ahead what will happen to
this water not when it gets in the river

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:15.229
this water not when it gets in the river
 

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:16.719
this water not when it gets in the river
but when it gets in the drinking water

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:16.729
but when it gets in the drinking water
 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:18.880
but when it gets in the drinking water
plant and when it gets in the people and

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:18.890
plant and when it gets in the people and
 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:20.230
plant and when it gets in the people and
so that's a lot of the work we do at

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:20.240
so that's a lot of the work we do at
 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.690
so that's a lot of the work we do at
that system's level saying what if and

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:22.700
that system's level saying what if and
 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.360
that system's level saying what if and
what's the next downstream effect of the

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:25.370
what's the next downstream effect of the
 

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:27.910
what's the next downstream effect of the
energy choices we're making we've seen a

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:27.920
energy choices we're making we've seen a
 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.280
energy choices we're making we've seen a
big trend over the last century of

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:30.290
big trend over the last century of
 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:31.720
big trend over the last century of

farms to living in cities that process

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:34.280
farms to living in cities that process
 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:35.500

that's affecting the entire globe and
 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:40.510
that's affecting the entire globe and
countries that have large and increasing

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:40.520
countries that have large and increasing
 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.100
countries that have large and increasing
populations are also becoming

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:42.110
populations are also becoming
 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:44.440
populations are also becoming
increasingly urban so we've seen the

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450
increasingly urban so we've seen the
 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:45.670
increasingly urban so we've seen the
development of what are called mega

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:45.680
development of what are called mega
 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:47.320

the infrastructure challenges are just

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020
the infrastructure challenges are just
 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:52.990
the infrastructure challenges are just
totally different there's a lot of water

challenging and so the urban work we're

00:02:24.399 --> 00:02:24.409
challenging and so the urban work we're
 

00:02:24.409 --> 00:02:26.229
