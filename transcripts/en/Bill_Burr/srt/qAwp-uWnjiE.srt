1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:02,090
My wife for whatever fucking reason,

2
00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:07,330
absolutely loves that show
that American greed and um,

3
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:09,700
yeah,

4
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:12,610
she watches like three of those episodes
every fucking night before we go to

5
00:00:12,611 --> 00:00:12,961
bed. And I,

6
00:00:12,961 --> 00:00:16,180
and I and I always ended up falling
asleep cause it's the same fucking story

7
00:00:16,181 --> 00:00:19,600
over and over again. You
know, it's the same thing.

8
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:22,960
The guy starts a for fucking
business. He dressing the parties,

9
00:00:22,961 --> 00:00:25,840
faking it till you make it.
He gets a bunch of investors,

10
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:29,800
he hands out fake spreadsheets and you've
got these fucking innocent people just

11
00:00:29,801 --> 00:00:31,870
go in like, you know, I'll,

12
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:36,540
I shot the recharge and I was getting
dirty, pretty it. And I was like woo,

13
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:39,520
you shove like a good Yale or me. Right.

14
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:44,120
And then they always go, you know, there's
always get some really bad metaphor.

15
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,600
They invested in an ice cream chain,

16
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:52,810
but this wasn't the flavor they were
looking for when we returned glass in the

17
00:00:53,811 --> 00:00:54,644
ice cream.

18
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:58,850
Oh Wow. Oh Wow.

19
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:04,140
Fucking song for American greed. I'll
tell you. And I was going to edible.

20
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:07,780
I'm fucking American. Great. Is
that cunt? Who shot that lion?

21
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:11,830
Everybody's talking about this dentists
that went over to illegally poached this

22
00:01:11,831 --> 00:01:15,000
lion that was friendly with
people. I love that shit. Oh,

23
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:18,460
is it a friendly with people until what?
It bites somebody fucking head off.

24
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:23,160
Fucking unreal. You know what I mean?
Everybody's fucking salient gas.

25
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:27,400
The pitbulls you shoot a fucking line.
Everything like, oh my wish. Nice.

26
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:30,340
He was a good line. I'm not
saying it was a bad line.

27
00:01:30,341 --> 00:01:31,780
I'm not saying the guy
shouldn't have done it.

28
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:36,360
I think everybody's missing the
fucking story here. Alright.

29
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:41,280
Speaking of American greed,
this guy paid 50 grand.

30
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:45,350
All right. That's just for the fuck.

31
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:49,700
That's not even for his flight to go
over there and kill this fucking lion.

32
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:51,343
All right.

33
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,680
No trying to start anything up here.

34
00:01:54,681 --> 00:01:59,681
But how the fuck can a dentist afford to
drop 50 grand to fly to Africa to shoot

35
00:02:03,551 --> 00:02:04,600
a fucking lion

36
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:06,863
illegally?

37
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:08,840
Just think of all the,

38
00:02:08,841 --> 00:02:12,290
how expensive the shoes he had to buy
that he had to sneak around and they had

39
00:02:12,291 --> 00:02:16,610
to be some sort of Ninja wear.
Fucking, I'm gonna shoot it a, uh,

40
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,790
a protected lion wear
that he had on right?

41
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:23,570
I dropped 50 grand on that and
now he's gone under ground.

42
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:26,960
They go over his house,
he's got a match, right?

43
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:29,240
And all they talking
about is his fucking line.

44
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:31,910
And I'm watching an
episode of American greed.

45
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:35,730
Oh Wow. Wow.

46
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:40,540
How the fuck can you afford or fill in
fucking how many teeth are you fill it.

47
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:47,020
This guy's pulling teeth. He's,
I'm telling you right now,

48
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:50,380
I used to work in a dental
office, right? And I,

49
00:02:50,381 --> 00:02:53,380
there was some good dentists just
like cops. There's some good cops.

50
00:02:53,381 --> 00:02:56,080
There's some bad cops. And I'm
not talking about interrogation,

51
00:02:57,220 --> 00:03:00,190
talking about brandishing a weapon. No,

52
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:03,910
I'm talking about fucking people pulling
teeth that didn't need to be pulled.

53
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:05,200
Fucking doing rooms,

54
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:09,730
doing fillings on teeth that did not
need to be fucking drilled into because

55
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:14,731
they bought a car beyond their
own fucking needs or whatever.

56
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:18,850
Their, their, their financial
responsibility. All right,

57
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:23,470
I think this guy should be fucking taken
back there just for the simple fact,

58
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:26,950
just for the simple
fact that, that he, uh,

59
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:33,130
he went to another country. It did
that. What do we got over here?

60
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:36,880
Does the MGM still have
a lion? What if he,

61
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:41,320
what if somebody from Zimbabwe came
over here? What about and the MGM lion,

62
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:45,970
right, right. As they were recording
that. You're watching an MGM film.

63
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:49,900
They fuck up. Please turn the air
conditioning back on back. Yeah.

64
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:53,230
The lovely knee. Everybody, she
came in. This is a studio man.

65
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:55,720
Dave Letterman had a
cold. I'm having a cold.

66
00:03:55,721 --> 00:03:59,920
He lasted fucking 30 years on television.
I want to do 30 years of podcasting.

67
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:05,620
Huh? Well, what's good
is the air conditioning.

68
00:04:05,621 --> 00:04:08,500
If you're going to fucking turn it
off. Listen, I'm talking about that.

69
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:13,000
Dentists that went out went
over to Zimbabwe. You got
to go grab a mic from the,

70
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:16,160
uh, from the closet there. Do
you know that story in here?

71
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:20,240
There's dentists from Minnesota.
He's a B. You know, like,

72
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:22,570
he's one of those big game
hunters, you know what I mean?

73
00:04:22,571 --> 00:04:23,650
He's one of those fucking guys.

74
00:04:23,651 --> 00:04:27,480
I'm going to shoot something that people
think is scary and that can be like,

75
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:28,990
God killed that Shit. You know,

76
00:04:28,991 --> 00:04:33,010
like it went up and he fucking put it in
a chokehold. It's like you didn't you,

77
00:04:33,011 --> 00:04:35,320
you went over and you shot
it. The fact that you can go,

78
00:04:35,321 --> 00:04:38,620
you can walk up and kill an armed man,

79
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:43,180
a human being with a gun, you could
fucking kill. You could, you could do it.

80
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:46,180
Even if he knew you were coming,
you have a gun, he has a gun,

81
00:04:46,181 --> 00:04:48,430
you could do that. So now
you're going up to a lion.

82
00:04:48,431 --> 00:04:50,050
The thing doesn't have a gun. So I mean,

83
00:04:50,051 --> 00:04:53,170
how fucking difficult is that actually
they shut out with a crossbow,

84
00:04:53,171 --> 00:04:55,090
but then the reason why they shouted
with a crossbow was because they were

85
00:04:55,091 --> 00:04:59,830
trying to disguise doesn't he have, he's
gone big game hunting before, right?

86
00:04:59,831 --> 00:05:01,780
Like he's done a line. Well,

87
00:05:01,781 --> 00:05:05,500
here's the thing that I thought I saw
some weirdly alarmists headline being

88
00:05:05,501 --> 00:05:06,580
like, you know,

89
00:05:06,581 --> 00:05:10,470
he's like a serial killer of animals and
it's like the way they were putting it

90
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,880
was like, you know, this is what
he does all the time. I don't know.

91
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,320
He's one of those guys.

92
00:05:14,321 --> 00:05:19,180
He thought it doesn't seem like he
kills to eat it as this for sport. Yeah.

93
00:05:19,181 --> 00:05:20,830
He's one of those guys to be like, Yay.

94
00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:23,930
You ever hear of an alligator
fucking shot one in there? Hey,

95
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:26,170
where's does he put it up in his
study or something like that.

96
00:05:26,171 --> 00:05:28,900
He's one of those guys. He's one of
those guys, so he won't want about him.

97
00:05:28,901 --> 00:05:31,230
He fled, right? Like he
uh, he will goes over,

98
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:35,920
he went over to Zimbabwe like a crossbow
and he fucking went into some like

99
00:05:35,921 --> 00:05:39,970
wildlife sanctuary. Allegedly.
This lion was friendly with people.

100
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,650
I love that shit. All the Lion
Cecil or whatever. It's, yeah,

101
00:05:44,651 --> 00:05:47,800
it's friendly until it isn't to the one
day you do something that reminds us,

102
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:51,310
you know, shuffling from his childhood
and it fucking bite your head off.

103
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,990
But it, it's what it's supposed to too.
It's a line. Yeah. You Kill Shit. Yeah,

104
00:05:55,991 --> 00:05:59,690
of course. So he went in and he fucking
killed it to capitated its skin.

105
00:05:59,691 --> 00:06:03,230
The fucking thing. Yeah. He wants
the head. Yeah. First of all,

106
00:06:03,231 --> 00:06:06,170
how do you get the head back? I Dunno.

107
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:10,840
I don't want to know that you
got to go gym bag. [inaudible]

108
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:14,570
they can get a drain it out. They
probably do it. They're like, oh no.

109
00:06:14,571 --> 00:06:16,550
You know what he did?
He probably taxidermy.

110
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:21,980
Well he probably like takes the fucking,
just this, this skin from the head.

111
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:24,740
You bring that back and then you just,

112
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:29,240
you have somebody like make a like a
lion skull and then you put it over there

113
00:06:29,241 --> 00:06:32,240
cause no one's going to know. Note
the skull isn't in there. Right.

114
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:36,420
This is the kind of shit this is like
Pat, no idea. Let me ask you this,

115
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:39,110
and yet, because you're into
American greed. This guy's a dentist.

116
00:06:39,111 --> 00:06:42,560
He paid 50 grand to do that.
Now he's gone underground.

117
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:45,500
They'd gone by his house. He has
a mansion. This guy's a dentist,

118
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:48,890
he's a mansion. He's going all these
expensive fucking uh, you know,

119
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:50,540
going around killing all these,

120
00:06:50,541 --> 00:06:52,340
how does it dentists have
all that fucking money?

121
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:57,230
Is he like a Hoity toity fancy dentist
that like doesn't take any insurance at

122
00:06:57,470 --> 00:07:00,350
all? Like self pay and it's the,
I worked in a dental office.

123
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:03,830
Nobody was going on a safari. Even
just look at them. Forget about too.

124
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:07,820
I just want to safari how much
money that is. Forget about.

125
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:11,810
You're going to go over there and
then sneak back later. Kill a lion.

126
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:16,010
What's your the fucking thing and
sneak it back. Yeah. I don't know.

127
00:07:16,011 --> 00:07:17,300
He sounds very sketchy though.

128
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:20,200
Oh Wow.

129
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:26,360
Well doing the theme to
American Green later.

130
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:30,290
Oh, by the way. So do you think,

131
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:34,520
do you hope that the United States extra
dates this dentist back to Zimbabwe?

132
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:37,670
Do you feel like you should do 10
years in prison and a hardcore prison?

133
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:41,900
Is he going to get a little, it's
going to get blood rigs I think.

134
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:47,180
I think he should be fine. Probably
a lot. Like a lot. No fuck that.

135
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:49,460
I think he should be
taken back at some point.

136
00:07:49,461 --> 00:07:52,370
You got to put a value on animals lives.

137
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:55,370
I agree it the way you're saying he
should go to Jay. I think he should.

138
00:07:55,371 --> 00:07:57,990
I don't think he should go
to the hardcore one. Right.

139
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:00,560
I think that he should go to the jail,

140
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:05,000
be in protective custody and through
his 10 years he should have to fix

141
00:08:05,001 --> 00:08:07,420
everybody's teeth. I think for free.

142
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:12,530
He should work in an animal sanctuary
like cleaning up all like the shit and

143
00:08:12,531 --> 00:08:17,360
everything. He can't ever, it's like
having a pedophile work at a kindergarten.

144
00:08:17,361 --> 00:08:22,010
Eventually he's going to fucking kill
some. It's don't be able just, that's all.

145
00:08:22,011 --> 00:08:24,420
I mean his, do you know
[inaudible] second.

146
00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:28,790
There's not some law in place about him
going and killing that animal cause it

147
00:08:28,791 --> 00:08:31,400
shouldn't. There already be some
other ways. But he left the country.

148
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:32,211
He left the country.

149
00:08:32,211 --> 00:08:36,080
He's back here and now he's got to get
the United States to send one of their

150
00:08:36,081 --> 00:08:37,130
own. Now the United States,

151
00:08:37,131 --> 00:08:41,360
we're not going to send the guy
because that's one of our guys.

152
00:08:41,361 --> 00:08:45,110
He's got the Barcode on the back of his
neck and he's not making us any fucking

153
00:08:45,111 --> 00:08:48,980
money if he by us, I mean the
Illuminati guys, you know what I mean?

154
00:08:48,981 --> 00:08:53,180
He's not paying any fucking a income
tax or any of that type of shit.

155
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:54,470
He's not walking around.

156
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:57,990
You know what he's supposed to be
saying cause he got it out of his TV.

157
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:02,790
You need that Zombie. You need that
guy. He's a big game hunter. That guy,

158
00:09:02,791 --> 00:09:05,130
he's going to be on the side of
those. I gotta be honest with you.

159
00:09:05,131 --> 00:09:08,670
I totally respect hunting. I think
it's the shit. I love animals too.

160
00:09:08,671 --> 00:09:12,780
But I think if you go out and you hunt
and then you do it for food or whatever,

161
00:09:12,781 --> 00:09:15,330
or you're doing it to learn
how to do it. I respect that.

162
00:09:15,331 --> 00:09:17,220
Go shoot a fucking deer.
There's a zillion of them.

163
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:20,280
They're like mosquitoes but like to
go out there and, and uh, you know,

164
00:09:20,281 --> 00:09:22,560
shoot a lion, a leopard to Jay,

165
00:09:22,561 --> 00:09:25,080
these beautiful fucking animals
where they do deployments.

166
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:28,950
There was a bunch of fucking, it was
herds, a lions running along the prairies.

167
00:09:28,951 --> 00:09:31,800
I mean, I, that's what we would have
on as a 4th of July, but we're not,

168
00:09:31,801 --> 00:09:36,000
we fucking killed all of them. I think
there's really something, uh, like, uh,

169
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:39,330
I don't what this guy does, I don't
lump all hundred hunters into,

170
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:43,320
did he go out on his own? Was he
like this row we hired these guys.

171
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,920
I was going to say he hired people, right?
So he had people who knew that Saran.

172
00:09:46,921 --> 00:09:47,790
Those guys are fostered.

173
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:52,620
Those guys are going to trial and
they're staring at 10 years. Oh they are?

174
00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:54,600
Oh yeah. And being a
bottom. I was going to say,

175
00:09:54,601 --> 00:09:58,080
I know he paid somebody like an exorbitant
amount of money in order to do that.

176
00:09:58,081 --> 00:10:00,450
He didn't just go out
there on his own. Yeah.

177
00:10:00,451 --> 00:10:04,350
It was incredibly stupid of the people
who lived there and this fucking guy,

178
00:10:04,351 --> 00:10:04,920
I don't know,

179
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:08,550
he must've had the size of that duffle
bag that he must've put the fucking head

180
00:10:08,551 --> 00:10:10,920
in. It's just, it's unbelievable
to me. That's what the whole,

181
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:15,720
how does the head travel
from man, what do you do?

182
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:21,570
I don't know. I don't know how you
take your hand. Put it up his ass.

183
00:10:21,571 --> 00:10:24,890
Like those drugs, meals, you know,
have to fill out those little cards.

184
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:27,900
We travel, we travel internationally.
It's like, are you going,

185
00:10:27,930 --> 00:10:32,400
are you bringing any fruit or any like
wildlife or anything like of plants?

186
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:35,040
I got an elephant's and my duffle bag.

187
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:39,450
Do you mind if I look in
your bag sir? Uh, yes I do.

188
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:44,730
Do you have any liquids in there? No.
It's all been drained and he's so sharp.

189
00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:46,830
Optic. You can do any of that,
but the fucking with the,

190
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:51,600
I actually think there's something
fucking wrong with you if you have to go

191
00:10:51,601 --> 00:10:56,400
around and killed the most
deadliest animals to human beings,

192
00:10:56,401 --> 00:10:58,560
like walking around doing that shit.

193
00:10:58,561 --> 00:11:01,500
I feel like that was an old
school like Teddy Roosevelt.

194
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:06,070
I'm an insecure guy and like you
shoot at, I can't kill the thing.

195
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:08,670
This like foreign land, like,
isn't that the whole thing?

196
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:12,450
It's like you sort of take over the
people and the neighborhoods and like the

197
00:11:12,451 --> 00:11:15,930
countries and then like kill all their
wildlife, isn't it all about like,

198
00:11:16,530 --> 00:11:19,340
I'm the big man and I can
just sort of, yeah, I don't,

199
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:23,060
I don't own nature as well as
man. I don't know what it's about,

200
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:26,280
but I can tell you only thing I'll give
him props was as he used to crossbow,

201
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:28,370
you know? That's, but of
course for, you know what,

202
00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:33,080
he had to fucking laser pointer and
shit. But like I, I just am not,

203
00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:38,090
America has bigger problems
than rich people shooting lions.
