00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.590
- [Instructor] Hashem obtained
a random sample of students

00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:05.600
and noticed a positive linear relationship

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:08.970
between their ages and
their backpack weights.

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.250
A 95% confidence interval for the slope

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:17.250
of the regression line was
0.39 plus or minus 0.23.

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.020
Hashem wants to use this interval to test

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.095
the null hypothesis that the true slope

00:00:25.095 --> 00:00:28.000
of the population regression line,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.105
so this is a population
parameter right here

00:00:30.105 --> 00:00:32.970
for the slope of the
population regression line,

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:36.160
is equal to zero versus
the alternative hypothesis

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:38.670
is that the true slope of the
population regression line

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.220
is not equal to zero at
the alpha is equal to 0.05

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.720
level of significance.

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:49.400
Assume that all conditions
for inference have been met.

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.880
So given the information that we just have

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:56.000
about what Hashem is doing,
what would be his conclusion?

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.180
Would he reject the null hypothesis,

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:59.930
which would suggest the alternative?

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:03.383
Or would have be unable to
reject the null hypothesis?

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:06.240
Well let's just think
about this a little bit.

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.620
We have a 95% confidence interval,

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:09.453
let me write this down,

00:01:09.453 --> 00:01:12.830
so our 95% confidence interval,

00:01:17.477 --> 00:01:18.390
we could write it like this

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.390
or you could say that it
goes from 0.39 minus 0.23,

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:27.880
so that'd be 0.16, it goes from 0.16

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.170
until 0.39 plus 0.23

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:37.540
is going to be 0.62.

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:40.153
Now what a 95% confidence
interval tells us

00:01:40.153 --> 00:01:43.610
is that 95% of the time
that we take a sample

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:46.680
and we construct a 95% confidence interval

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.840
that 95% of the time we do this,

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.990
it should overlap with the
true population parameter

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:55.150
that we are trying to estimate.

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:57.740
But in this hypothesis test, remember,

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.740
we're assuming that the
true population parameter

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:04.470
is equal to zero and that does not overlap

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:06.370
with this confidence interval.

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:08.870
So assuming, let me write this down,

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:13.433
assuming null hypothesis is true,

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:18.650
we are in the less than or equal

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:22.400
to 5% chance of situations

00:02:27.647 --> 00:02:30.630
where beta not overlap

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:39.180
with 95% intervals.

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.400
And the whole notion of
hypothesis testing is

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.290
you assume the null hypothesis,

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:47.780
you take your sample, and
then if you get statistics,

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:49.830
if the probability of
getting those statistics

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:52.300
for something even more
extreme than those statistics

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:54.510
is less than your significance level,

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.650
then you reject the null hypothesis

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:59.020
and that's exactly what's happening here.

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:01.360
This null hypothesis value
is nowhere even close

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.840
to overlapping, it's over 0.16ths

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.690
below the low end of this bound.

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:11.690
And so because of that, we
would reject the null hypothesis

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:17.600
which suggests the alternative,

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:20.130
which suggests the alternative hypothesis

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:23.150
and one way to interpret
this alternative hypothesis

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:25.448
that beta is not equal to zero

00:03:25.448 --> 00:03:30.080
is that there is

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:35.080
a non zero linear relationship

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:45.120
between ages and backpack weights.

00:03:50.888 --> 00:03:52.221
And we are done.
