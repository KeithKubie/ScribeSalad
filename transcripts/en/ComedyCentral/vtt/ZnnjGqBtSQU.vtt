00:00:01.001 --> 00:00:02.903
It is Cyber Monday,
the online shopping day

00:00:02.936 --> 00:00:05.239
where you can throw away
all the money you saved

00:00:05.272 --> 00:00:06.840
at the stores on Black Friday!

00:00:06.874 --> 00:00:09.243
And congratulations, by the way,
to those of you who survived

00:00:09.276 --> 00:00:12.546
Black Friday, that capitalist
spectacle where shoppers

00:00:12.579 --> 00:00:15.115
from all walks of life come
together to spread holiday cheer

00:00:15.148 --> 00:00:17.050
and punch their fellow man
in the (bleep) face

00:00:17.084 --> 00:00:18.685
for a kid's toy.

00:00:18.719 --> 00:00:20.754
Like these thrifty customers.

00:00:20.787 --> 00:00:22.856
-Ready?
-Yeah. -MAN: Yeah.

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.791
-No!
-(overlapping shouting)

00:00:24.825 --> 00:00:28.161
-Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
-(indistinct shouting)

00:00:28.195 --> 00:00:30.564
(sighing):
Oh!

00:00:30.597 --> 00:00:33.066
Wow. Look at those savings.

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:34.768
His life is half off!

00:00:34.801 --> 00:00:36.537
(laughter)

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.038
-These... these... sons...
-(applause)

00:00:38.071 --> 00:00:42.075
Hey, no. Stop it, Pete. Stop it.

00:00:42.109 --> 00:00:44.711
-Uh... these...
-(laughter)

00:00:44.745 --> 00:00:47.681
These poor S.O.B.s
trampling one another

00:00:47.714 --> 00:00:50.217
like spooked buffalo
to get a deal on

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.618
electronic Panini makers.

00:00:51.652 --> 00:00:53.353
This is an American tradition,
you guys.

00:00:53.387 --> 00:00:55.422
But what about our neighbors
to the north?

00:00:55.455 --> 00:00:57.624
Check out this video posted
by Suzette Belliveau.

00:00:57.658 --> 00:01:00.627
This is how they do Black Friday
in Canada.

00:01:00.661 --> 00:01:04.431
-Oh, God!
-(laughter)

00:01:04.464 --> 00:01:07.734
-Aah!
-(applause and cheering)

00:01:07.768 --> 00:01:10.938
-Oh!
-(whooping)

00:01:10.971 --> 00:01:14.608
HARDWICK (laughing):
Those...

00:01:14.641 --> 00:01:16.743
See, these polite consumers--
they may not have died

00:01:16.777 --> 00:01:19.379
in a mall, but they will meet
their end years later

00:01:19.413 --> 00:01:21.515
being gored by a moose
while drinking Labatts

00:01:21.548 --> 00:01:23.050
over an ice fishing hole,

00:01:23.083 --> 00:01:26.420
-or, as Canadians call that,
natural causes. -(laughter)

00:01:26.453 --> 00:01:28.755
So, comedians, what are some
announcements

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:32.292
you would you hear over the P.A.
at Canadian Black Friday?

00:01:32.326 --> 00:01:33.694
-Peter Holmes.
-Hi, Chris.

00:01:33.727 --> 00:01:35.095
Hi, Peter.

00:01:35.128 --> 00:01:36.797
How about, "Attention Canadians.

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:38.699
"If you're out of cash,
don't worry.

00:01:38.732 --> 00:01:41.602
"We also accept check,
credit card, firm handshakes,

00:01:41.635 --> 00:01:44.104
-eye contact and tickles."?
-(laughter, applause &amp; cheering)

00:01:44.137 --> 00:01:45.672
HARDWICK: All right, yeah.
Points. Points.

00:01:45.706 --> 00:01:47.774
Very nice.

00:01:47.808 --> 00:01:50.544
Joe DeRosa.

00:01:50.577 --> 00:01:53.580
Canadians, let us all enjoy
this peace while it lasts,

00:01:53.614 --> 00:01:56.984
because America <i>will </i>
be attacking us very soon,

00:01:57.017 --> 00:01:58.852
because President Trump

00:01:58.886 --> 00:02:03.323
has a tiny, tiny,
tiny, tiny penis.

00:02:03.357 --> 00:02:07.294
(applause and cheering)

00:02:07.327 --> 00:02:10.464
HARDWICK:
Points.

00:02:10.497 --> 00:02:13.267
(with Canadian accent):
Also, clean up on Aisle A.

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.636
-Uh...
-(laughter)

00:02:15.669 --> 00:02:18.572
-Come on, you guys.
It was right there. -Yeah.

00:02:18.605 --> 00:02:20.607
How would I not?

00:02:20.641 --> 00:02:24.011
I'm never gonna be welcomed back
in Canada again. Hari.

00:02:24.044 --> 00:02:27.214
Attention, Canadians--
$50 healthcare.

00:02:27.247 --> 00:02:27.314
You sign up for healthcare,
we give you $50.
