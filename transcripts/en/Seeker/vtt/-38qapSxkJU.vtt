00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.970
Acne: it’s something almost all of us have
to deal with at some point - but why does

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:05.970
it exist?

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.850
Is it something evolutionary - or is it merely
a product of our lifestyle?

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:14.860
Hey guys, Tara here for Dnews - and today,
I wanna talk about acne.

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:16.980
Not about what it is, or how to get rid of
it.

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.100
No, I wanna talk about the purpose behind
acne.

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:23.550
The real, evolutionary reason as to why humans
suffer from this.

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:24.690
Is there even a reason?

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:26.130
I mean, it can’t do anything good, right?

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.830
It just makes our lives miserable.

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:28.980
So why do we get it?

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.529
Well believe it or not, there’s still a
lot about acne that we don’t know.

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:36.760
But there are a handful of theories out there,
that seek to explain why it’s such a common

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:37.760
problem.

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:42.309
One theory, proposed by evolutionary biologists
Stephen Kellett and Paul Gilbert, is that

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:47.449
acne evolved because humans lost our body
fur too quickly for our skin to keep up.

00:00:47.449 --> 00:00:51.730
According to them, our skin’s sebaceous
glands - which were at one point, almost entirely

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:56.049
covered in fur - haven’t evolved at the
same pace at which we lost our fur.

00:00:56.049 --> 00:01:00.940
So as a result, all of the sebum that once
existed in order to lubricate our fur - has

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:04.409
no more fur to lubricate, so now, it just
clogs our pores instead.

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:05.909
That’s one explanation.

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:11.190
But another study, published in 2004, theorizes
that the time frame of acne - the fact that

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:15.659
it’s most prevalent during puberty - suggests
that it plays a role in sexual selection.

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:21.500
They refer to acne as a “high-order psychoneuroimmune
interaction” that functions to ward off

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:27.250
potential mates until a person is past the
age of reproductive maturity, and thus, “emotionally,

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:29.820
intellectually, and physically fit to be a
parent.”

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.619
Which makes perfect sense - but then why do
some adults still get acne?

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:34.979
Are they just unfit parents?

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.160
Of course not!

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:37.240
I mean maybe, I don’t really know.

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.750
But both of those theories could explain why
humans adapted to have acne.

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:45.080
Other arguments say that acne may not be an
adaptation at all - but rather, a side effect

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:46.080
of our lifestyle.

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:49.770
Diet, for example, has been shown to have
an effect on our skin - and the fact that

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.549
the human diet in particular has changed so
drastically over the span of our existence

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:57.680
- means that modern agriculture could be the
culprit.

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:02.249
Specifically, dairy and grains - both of which
HAVE been linked to increased levels of acne.

00:02:02.249 --> 00:02:06.659
There was an interesting study about this
back in 2005, that talked about tribal people

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:10.400
from Canada and Japan, who broke out after
being introduced to dairy.

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:15.200
And a similar story, about aborigines from
Paraguay and Papua New Guinea that ate almost

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.780
no complex carbs, and likewise had no history
of acne.

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.470
There could be a lot of reasons for that though,
one of which is the basis for another major

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:26.470
lifestyle theory - which is that we simply
wash our faces too much.

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:29.530
This is definitely one of the more experimental
suggestions, given that there isn’t a whole

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:32.800
lot of data to back it up, but it does make
sense.

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:36.720
Early humans almost never bathed, but now
- we live in an age where it’s considered

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.140
hygienic to wash our faces twice a day.

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:43.300
And by constantly removing the surface oil
from our faces, it’s possible that we’re

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:47.660
actually inducing the opposite effect - we’re
sending our oil glands into overproduction,

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:50.130
resulting in even more oil than what’s natural.

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:54.380
Again - most of this is pure conjecture, but
anecdotally - I will say that I have a friend

00:02:54.380 --> 00:03:00.060
who has never washed his face, doesn’t even
get it wet in the shower - and he has perfect

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:01.060
skin.

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:02.060
Never had a pimple in his life.

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:04.690
Which is probably more due to genetics than
anything else - but still.

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:05.690
Food for thought.

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:06.780
What do you guys think?

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:10.030
Have you suffered from acne, and if so - what
did you to do fix it?

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:14.340
Let us know your thoughts, in the comments
below - and as always, thank you guys for

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:14.510
watching!
