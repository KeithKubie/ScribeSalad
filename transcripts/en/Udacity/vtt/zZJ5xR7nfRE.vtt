00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:04.360
We can represent these finite state machines in a variety of ways.

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:07.650
Let's start with a tabular form called a state transition table.

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:12.070
Here the rows correspond to states and there are four columns. One column for

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:17.120
the name of the state. Another for the input event which is going to

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:21.590
cause a transition. The third for whatever output action is going to

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:26.590
be taken upon the transition, and the fourth for the next state. That is,

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:31.390
the state transition table is going to capture the idea that a system in

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:36.240
a given state, when given a certain stimulus, and when a stimulus occurs.

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:41.400
Is possibly going to produce some action or response, and

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:47.500
leave itself in a in a state, possibly the same or possibly a different state.

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:52.915
To see how this works, let's imagine a garage door opening system. In fact, a,

00:00:52.915 --> 00:00:58.080
a simplified version of my garage door opening system. Okay. It's gotta motor

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:02.630
and that motor can be lifting the door up, it can be pushing the door down, or

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:08.450
it can be stopped. There's a button that can be pressed to turn the motor on and

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:14.220
off. The door itself can be all the way open, all the way closed,

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.120
or stopped at some intermediate intermediate state along the way.

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:24.470
Importantly, the, is what happens when you press the button, and

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:30.026
in this particular garage door situation, okay. What happens when you

00:01:30.026 --> 00:01:33.650
press the button can be one of three things depending upon what state you're in.

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:38.080
If the motor is stopped and you press the button, it starts going but

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:43.400
in the opposite direction it was going before. If the motor is going upward and

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:49.200
you hit the button, it stops, leaving the door wherever it was at that time.

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:54.250
However, for security or safety reasons, if the motor's going downward and

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:57.460
you press the button, it not only stops but then it immediately turns on and

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:02.130
goes in the other direction. Presumably because something was detected that

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.910
might be damaged by the door going down on it. And implicit in this is

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:10.850
some sensors. One sensor determining whether the door is all the way up, and

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:13.300
another sensor saying whether the door is all the way down.
