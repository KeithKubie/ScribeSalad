00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Now I'd like to ask you about the relationship between a pie chart and a histogram.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Both of which represent count data or frequency data or, if you prefer, relative sizes.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:23.000
For this pie chart, I'd like you to tell me which histogram looks like it came from the same data.

00:00:23.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Is it this or this or this or is it this? Select the closest answer.
