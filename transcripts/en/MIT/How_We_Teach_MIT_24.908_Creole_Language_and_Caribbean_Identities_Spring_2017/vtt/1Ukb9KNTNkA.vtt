JOSE ESPARZA: So my
name is Jose Esparza.

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:12.580
I'm a junior in
mathematics and economics.

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:14.270
My focus is
development economics,

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:16.680
so I got to know Michel's--

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.210
Professor DeGraff's
work, because

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:21.570
of what he does with the
MIT Haiti initiative.

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.470
And the reason I
took this course

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:25.960
is because I thought that his
efforts were very important,

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:28.690
and that it was an opportunity
to improve the world

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:30.640
and I wanted to hear
more of what he did,

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:33.310
and the theory of why
he does what he does.

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:35.320
After taking this
course, my perspective

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:41.000
of language and
identity changed,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.540
in that now I was able
to see the connection

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:47.900
between the languages we
speak, but also how that

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:50.870
ties into cultures, in
general, and more importantly

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:52.450
to politics.

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:56.900
And in some sense, we can see
a lot of the big things that

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:01.250
happen in society, like
neocolonialism, or the effects

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:03.680
of institutions-- a
lot of these things,

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.620
although they might be
cloudy in some sort,

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:11.252
language is a good
way to view the world.

00:01:11.252 --> 00:01:12.710
One of the first
essays was to look

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:16.200
our own life, or a biography
through the lens of language.

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.880
And in studying how institutions
interact with each other

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.550
through the sense of
language opens up either

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:26.000
how some cultures are
not taken as seriously

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.804
as others, how it tells
you about the history

00:01:29.804 --> 00:01:30.470
about the world.

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:33.500
And it taught me to see
language as something

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.020
that ties a lot of things
about humans together.

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.669
And it was just a different
way to look at the world.
