00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:04.120
We're asked to simplify
the principal square root

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:05.490
of negative 52.

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.230
And we're going to assume,
because we have a negative 52

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:10.360
here inside of the
radical, that this

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:15.160
is the principal branch of the
complex square root function.

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:18.290
That we can actually put,
input, negative numbers

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:19.790
in the domain of this function.

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:24.180
That we can actually get
imaginary, or complex, results.

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.410
So we can rewrite negative
52 as negative 1 times 52.

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.910
So this can be rewritten as
the principal square root

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:38.080
of negative 1 times 52.

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:41.120
And then, if we assume that
this is the principal branch

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.780
of the complex square root
function, we can rewrite this.

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:48.400
This is going to be equal to
the square root of negative 1

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:51.280
times-- or I should say,
the principal square root

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:58.330
of negative 1 times the
principal square root of 52.

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:00.960
Now, I want to be
very, very clear here.

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.750
You can do what we just did.

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:05.830
If we have the principal square
root of the product of two

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:08.410
things, we can rewrite that
as the principal square root

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:10.790
of each, and then
we take the product.

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:13.320
But you can only do
this, or I should say,

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.240
you can only do this if
either both of these numbers

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:19.300
are positive, or only
one of them is negative.

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:22.970
You cannot do this if both
of these were negative.

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:25.600
For example, you
could not do this.

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:31.550
You could not say the
principal square root of 52

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:37.030
is equal to negative
1 times negative 52.

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:37.897
You could do this.

00:01:37.897 --> 00:01:39.480
So far, I haven't
said anything wrong.

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:43.260
52 is definitely negative
1 times negative 52.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:44.960
But then, since these
are both negative,

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:50.650
you cannot then say that this
is equal to the square root

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:54.780
of negative 1 times the
square root of negative 52.

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.190
In fact, I invite
you to continue

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:57.330
on this train of reasoning.

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:59.370
You're going to get
a nonsensical answer.

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:02.790
This is not OK.

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.860
You cannot do this,
right over here.

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.009
And the reason why you cannot do
this is that this property does

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.130
not work when both of
these numbers are negative.

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:14.570
Now with that said, we
can do it if only one

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:18.110
of them are negative or both of
them are positive, obviously.

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:20.119
Now, the principal square
root of negative 1,

00:02:20.119 --> 00:02:21.910
if we're talking about
the principal branch

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:25.340
of the complex square
root function, is i.

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:29.456
So this right over here
does simplify to i.

00:02:29.456 --> 00:02:31.080
And then let's think
if we can simplify

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.600
the square root of 52 any.

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.100
And to do that, we can think
about its prime factorization,

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:39.920
see if we have any perfect
squares sitting in there.

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:48.140
So 52 is 2 times 26,
and 26 is 2 times 13.

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:50.800
So we have 2 times
2 there, or 4 there,

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.520
which is a perfect square.

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:58.050
So we can rewrite this as equal
to-- Well, we have our i, now.

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:00.720
The principal square
root of negative 1 is i.

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.230
The other square root of
negative 1 is negative i.

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:05.589
But the principal square
root of negative 1 is i.

00:03:05.589 --> 00:03:07.130
And then we're going
to multiply that

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:12.840
times the square
root of 4 times 13.

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:23.020
And this is going to be equal
to i times the square root of 4.

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:25.780
i times the square root of 4,
or the principal square root

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:29.030
of 4 times the principal
square root of 13.

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:31.880
The principal square
root of 4 is 2.

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:34.650
So this all simplifies, and
we can switch the order,

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:35.200
over here.

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:39.330
This is equal to 2 times
the square root of 13.

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:42.610
2 times the principal square
root of 13, I should say,

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:45.360
times i.

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:47.436
And I just switched
around the order.

00:03:47.436 --> 00:03:49.060
It makes it a little
bit easier to read

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:51.620
if I put the i after
the numbers over here.

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:54.627
But I'm just multiplying i times
2 times the square root of 13.

00:03:54.627 --> 00:03:56.460
That's the same thing
as multiplying 2 times

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:59.530
the principal square
root of 13 times i.

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:03.960
And I think this is about as
simplified as we can get here.
