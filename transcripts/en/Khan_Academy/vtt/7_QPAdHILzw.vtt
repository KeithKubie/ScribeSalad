00:00:00.966 --> 00:00:03.166
- So, this right over here is one way

00:00:03.166 --> 00:00:08.166
to represent the number 37.

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:13.200
The number 37 has a three right
over here in the tens place.

00:00:13.533 --> 00:00:18.000
So, this three literally
represents three tens.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.366
Notice, this is a ten
here, this is a ten here,

00:00:21.366 --> 00:00:25.300
and this is a ten here, three tens or 30.

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:28.133
You see each of these tens,
there's one, two, three, four,

00:00:28.133 --> 00:00:31.667
five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

00:00:31.667 --> 00:00:33.666
Now, the seven is in the ones place.

00:00:33.666 --> 00:00:36.700
It literally represents seven ones.

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:39.800
You see that right over here,
one, two, three, four, five,

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:44.800
six, seven, so you can say that 37

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:52.666
is equal to three tens,

00:00:52.666 --> 00:00:57.633
do this in the purple color,
is equal to three tens

00:00:57.633 --> 00:01:02.633
plus seven ones.

00:01:06.567 --> 00:01:10.000
Now, what if I wanted
to add something to 37?

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000
What would 37

00:01:18.266 --> 00:01:23.266
plus two be equal to?

00:01:23.466 --> 00:01:26.367
How many tens and how many ones?

00:01:26.367 --> 00:01:26.933
Well, let's think about it.

00:01:26.933 --> 00:01:31.833
We're now going to add two,
so we're adding two ones,

00:01:31.833 --> 00:01:36.000
so we're going to add one and two.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.035
So, now we still have three
tens, so let's write that down.

00:01:40.035 --> 00:01:44.333
So we still have three
tens, but now we have

00:01:44.333 --> 00:01:47.866
a different number of ones,
we now have one, two, three,

00:01:47.866 --> 00:01:51.900
four, five, six, seven, eight,
nine, we now have nine ones.

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:52.800
Another way to think about it is

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:57.800
seven ones plus two ones is nine ones.

00:01:57.933 --> 00:01:59.567
So let me write that down.

00:01:59.567 --> 00:02:04.567
So, plus nine ones, or another
way to think about it is

00:02:05.033 --> 00:02:09.633
37, let me just write it the same way,

00:02:09.633 --> 00:02:14.633
37 plus 2 is equal to three tens,

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.933
so I can write this as 30

00:02:19.933 --> 00:02:24.933
and then nine ones, is equal to 39,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.300
and that's exactly what we have here.

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:28.566
We have 30, this was the three tens,

00:02:28.566 --> 00:02:33.566
and then we have nine
ones, which is 39 squares.
