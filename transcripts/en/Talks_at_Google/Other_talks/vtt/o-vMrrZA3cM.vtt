FEMALE SPEAKER: Hi everyone.

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:03.530
Thank you for coming.

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:06.610
I'd like to introduce Dr. Traci
Mann, a professor at UCLA,

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:10.110
here to talk about her book,
"Secrets From the Eating Lab."

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:11.577
TRACI MANN: Thank you so much.

00:00:11.577 --> 00:00:12.660
I'm very happy to be here.

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:13.730
Thank you all for coming here.

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:15.855
I know it's Monday, the
beginning of the work week.

00:00:15.855 --> 00:00:18.170
You probably have your
head somewhere else.

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:23.940
I appreciate you coming here
right now to hear from me.

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:25.520
I'm a psychologist.

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:28.560
And for over 20
years about, I've

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.690
been studying the self-control
of eating, basically

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:34.000
looking at whether people
can resist foods that are

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.740
right there in front of them?

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:40.660
And over the years, I've learned
what all psychologists learn

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:45.130
quite quickly, which is that
when people ask me what I do,

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:46.290
I have learned to never.

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:49.440
Ever, ever say that
I'm a psychologist.

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.040
People immediately assume
that I'm a therapist.

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:54.760
I'm not-- they
immediately assume

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:59.190
that I study or know something
about psychopathology.

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:00.830
I don't.

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:02.560
But they assume this
and start telling me

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:05.269
all about their
crazy uncle or worse.

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:06.660
Themself.

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:09.010
So I don't do that anymore.

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:10.880
Now, you guys do not
have this problem.

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.090
You get to tell people
that you work here.

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:14.820
And they think that's cool.

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.490
So it's a whole-- although maybe
they get jealous and cranky

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.020
and then maybe it all
goes to hell after that.

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:20.940
I don't know.

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:22.640
Anyway, we all have
our own problems.

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.860
You guys don't
have that problem.

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:28.350
Here's how I deal with my
problem is instead of telling

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.390
people I'm a
psychologist, I've learned

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.210
to be a couple steps
more specific than that

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:35.010
about what I do.

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:37.010
So I say that I
run an eating lab

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:40.850
and do research on the
self-control of eating.

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:45.290
And whenever I tell people that,
they always say the same thing.

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:46.906
Not that.

00:01:46.906 --> 00:01:48.444
Not that ever.

00:01:48.444 --> 00:01:49.310
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:50.990
Nobody ever says that.

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:55.790
Nobody has ever, ever, in over
20 years, said that to me.

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:58.730
Do these people exist?

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:59.820
I don't know.

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:00.820
Probably.

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:03.320
Because as a psychologist, I
know that all kinds of people

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:04.750
exist.

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:08.410
But I think it's probably rare.

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:11.320
And, in fact, maybe some of
you are this kind of person.

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:12.930
I don't know.

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.190
And don't tell us if you are
because no one wants to know.

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:18.560
No one wants to hear it.

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.180
Anyway, it exists,
but it's rare.

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:22.750
What everybody
actually says to me--

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:26.260
and I do mean everybody,
without exception, everybody

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.280
says to me, oh man,
self-control of eating,

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.220
I need help with that.

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:32.070
I need some of that.

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:33.820
That's what I struggle with.

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:36.205
And they all say it as
if they're this unique--

00:02:36.205 --> 00:02:38.930
it's sort of that they have
this unique struggle that most

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:42.790
other people don't have,
all these people thinking

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:44.880
that they're alone
in their inability

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.050
to reliably resists foods.

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:48.300
They're not alone.

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.150
They're pretty much everybody.

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:53.970
Everybody struggles with
self-control, thin people,

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:57.200
fat people, everyone in between.

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.340
Now, are you guys OK with
me using the word fat?

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:01.416
We're good.

00:03:01.416 --> 00:03:05.180
It's just a word, not
a judgment in any way.

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:06.130
No valence.

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:07.294
It's just a description.

00:03:07.294 --> 00:03:08.710
Because sometimes
I use that word.

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:10.350
Sometimes I say obese.

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:11.350
Sometimes I say fat.

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:14.040
So I want to make
sure we're all good.

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:15.680
OK, so everybody
struggles with this.

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:17.180
Now if everyone
struggles with this,

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:20.910
it's hard to see how this could
be the crucial factor that

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:22.660
explains who's
going to end up thin

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:24.680
and who's going to end up fat.

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:28.930
And sure enough, there is
plenty of scientific evidence

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:32.387
that shows that willpower,
self-control-- those

00:03:32.387 --> 00:03:33.220
are the same things.

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:35.842
I'm going to use those
words interchangeably.

00:03:35.842 --> 00:03:37.550
There's plenty of
evidence that willpower

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:41.420
plays a much smaller
role in people's weight

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:43.710
than everybody thinks.

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:46.252
I'm going to tell you about
some of that evidence.

00:03:46.252 --> 00:03:48.210
But first, let's just
think through a situation

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:50.640
so that you could actually
appreciate why it probably

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:52.830
doesn't matter very much.

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:54.160
So here's the situation.

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.950
Suppose you're in a
meeting and there's

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:58.900
someone-- one of your
coworkers comes in

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:01.069
and plops a box of
donuts down on the table.

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:02.610
And you're all
sitting at this table.

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:04.590
I'm imagining what
meetings are like.

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:06.597
I have never actually
held a real job.

00:04:06.597 --> 00:04:08.180
So I don't know what
meetings actually

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:09.480
are like in the real world.

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:11.500
Anyway, this is the
picture that I have.

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:13.271
A big table, everyone
sitting around it.

00:04:13.271 --> 00:04:15.020
Somebody comes in with
this box of donuts.

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:15.860
It's great.

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:18.510
Except that you are trying
to resist having a donut.

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:21.131
For whatever reason, you don't
want to be eating a donut.

00:04:21.131 --> 00:04:22.380
So you're trying to resist it.

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:25.220
Now, resisting this donut during
the course of this meeting

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:29.210
is not just one simple
act of self-control.

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:31.840
This is many, many
acts of self-control.

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:34.544
You have to resist it now,
when they plop down the box.

00:04:34.544 --> 00:04:36.710
And you have to resist it
two minutes from now, when

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:39.800
you look up and notice it
again, and a minute after that,

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:40.830
and a minute after that.

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:43.038
And you basically have to
resist it every single time

00:04:43.038 --> 00:04:44.840
you look up and
notice it, which is

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:48.050
going to be some combination,
some sort of interaction

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:52.160
between how exciting the meeting
is and how hungry you are.

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:55.100
And the hungrier
you are, the more

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:57.060
you will look up and notice it.

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:00.080
Now if you resist this
donut the first 19

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:03.090
times that you look
up and notice it,

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:06.700
but then you get distracted
by something going on

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:09.460
in the meeting or something
else, if you get distracted,

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:12.930
have a two-second moment of
weakness during which you take

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:15.920
one of those donuts and
subsequently go on to eat it,

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:18.650
if this happens, you
do not get credit

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:22.850
for those very impressive
19 displays of self-control

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:24.320
that you just demonstrated.

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:27.910
You have nothing to show for it.

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:29.920
You may as well have
had bad self-control

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:32.910
for all the good your
impressive self-control did

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:33.870
for you in the end.

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:34.670
You ate the donut.

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:37.430
But so did your friend, with
much worse self-control,

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:40.990
who ate it on the fifth time
that they looked up and noticed

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:42.260
it.

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:45.470
So with eating, momentary
lapses of self-control

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:48.750
basically erase
previous successes.

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:51.790
And that essentially wipes out
the differences between people,

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:53.519
except on the extremes.

00:05:53.519 --> 00:05:55.810
In the extremes, you're still
going to see differences.

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:57.470
But in the vast
middle, you're not

00:05:57.470 --> 00:05:59.107
going to see a lot
of differences.

00:05:59.107 --> 00:06:01.190
Now, this is not really
true with other behaviors.

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:03.570
So let's think about
another behavior.

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:06.160
Let's think about
academic achievement,

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:08.230
getting good grades,
doing well on tests.

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:09.970
This requires self-control.

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:13.387
You need to use self-control
when you're studying for a test

00:06:13.387 --> 00:06:15.220
basically, so that you
don't get distracted.

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:17.180
And, of course,
this task is harder

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:20.050
than it's ever been
for young people.

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:23.135
I mean we used to sit
down with a book to study.

00:06:23.135 --> 00:06:24.760
And there weren't so
many distractions.

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:25.910
Now, you're studying.

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:26.740
You're online.

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:30.246
It's a click away to start
doing something else,

00:06:30.246 --> 00:06:32.120
to start answering mail,
or watching a video,

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:34.060
whatever it is.

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:36.330
So you're studying for a test.

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:39.310
Now, let's say you have
a lapse of self-control.

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:43.180
And instead of studying, you
stop and you do whatever.

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:46.350
You watch some videos.

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:50.130
Maybe this costs you a
few minutes of studying.

00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:53.750
Maybe it costs you five
minutes of studying, maybe 10.

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:55.100
That's not great.

00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:58.240
But, importantly,
what it didn't do

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:01.580
was erase all of the studying
that had come before.

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:03.850
All the studying you did up
until that point is still

00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:04.350
there.

00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:06.120
It's still in the bank.

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:08.190
Your lapse of self-control
didn't undo it,

00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:10.470
the way it does with eating.

00:07:10.470 --> 00:07:14.440
So eating is uniquely
unforgiving of lapses

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:16.420
in self-control.

00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:20.390
And then to make matters
worse, lapses in self-control

00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:23.420
are also extremely
hard to avoid when

00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:26.680
it comes to eating because we
have too many opportunities.

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:28.630
There's food all
around, everywhere.

00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:31.210
There's too many
temptations all around us.

00:07:31.210 --> 00:07:33.640
It's certainly true
here in your workplace.

00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:35.360
And temptation is everywhere.

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:38.240
And lapses, it's too
easy for them to happen.

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:39.460
And they happen so quickly.

00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:42.630
There's always enough time to
have a lapse in self-control

00:07:42.630 --> 00:07:43.980
when it comes to eating.

00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:47.920
So willpower would have to
be incredibly strong, nearly

00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:49.480
flawless to handle that.

00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:50.200
But it's not.

00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:51.390
It's actually the opposite.

00:07:51.390 --> 00:07:53.344
Willpower is fragile.

00:07:53.344 --> 00:07:53.885
It's fragile.

00:07:53.885 --> 00:07:56.280
And it's really easy to disrupt.

00:07:56.280 --> 00:07:59.750
So for years, all these years
of my lab doing studies,

00:07:59.750 --> 00:08:02.437
where we put milkshakes
in front of dieters

00:08:02.437 --> 00:08:04.020
with the goal of
looking at what would

00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:08.440
help them to resist a milkshake
and what would mess them up?

00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:10.840
And basically,
everything messed them up

00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:12.370
and nothing helped them.

00:08:12.370 --> 00:08:14.610
And you say it's really fragile.

00:08:14.610 --> 00:08:17.390
Another problem
with willpower is

00:08:17.390 --> 00:08:19.100
that despite what
you probably have

00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:21.525
seen on the cover of
magazines, depending

00:08:21.525 --> 00:08:24.090
on if you look at
this sort of magazine,

00:08:24.090 --> 00:08:26.120
there is no evidence
at all that people

00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:28.500
can harness their willpower.

00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:30.690
I'm actually not sure
what that even means,

00:08:30.690 --> 00:08:32.909
but I know that
it's not possible.

00:08:32.909 --> 00:08:35.257
If that's possible, to
know it's not possible

00:08:35.257 --> 00:08:36.590
when I don't know what it means.

00:08:36.590 --> 00:08:38.940
There's no evidence that
you can grow your willpower

00:08:38.940 --> 00:08:41.419
or get better at it.

00:08:41.419 --> 00:08:43.610
So I promised some evidence
that willpower doesn't

00:08:43.610 --> 00:08:46.280
matter so much for weight.

00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:48.950
So here's some evidence.

00:08:48.950 --> 00:08:51.370
There's a test they use
in willpower research

00:08:51.370 --> 00:08:54.400
to see how good or bad your
willpower is, how good or bad

00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:56.160
your self-control is.

00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:58.320
And this is called
the marshmallow test.

00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:00.280
And you've probably heard of it.

00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:01.730
It's very well known.

00:09:01.730 --> 00:09:03.135
This is not from my own work.

00:09:03.135 --> 00:09:04.510
This is from other
people's work,

00:09:04.510 --> 00:09:06.379
in particular Walter Michel.

00:09:06.379 --> 00:09:08.420
And you basically leave
a four-year-old kid alone

00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:11.680
with one marshmallow
and tell them

00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:14.250
that if they can resist
it, then later they

00:09:14.250 --> 00:09:16.850
can have two marshmallows.

00:09:16.850 --> 00:09:19.310
So then they just
see how long the kid

00:09:19.310 --> 00:09:20.770
can resist the one marshmallow.

00:09:20.770 --> 00:09:22.924
They actually count up
the seconds or minutes

00:09:22.924 --> 00:09:24.590
that the kid can
resist the marshmallow.

00:09:24.590 --> 00:09:26.400
It's very difficult
for some kids,

00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:30.012
although this guy's doing way
better than my kids ever did.

00:09:30.012 --> 00:09:32.470
No psychologist should ever
test their own kid on anything.

00:09:32.470 --> 00:09:35.370
But when my kids turned
four, I stuck them alone

00:09:35.370 --> 00:09:36.170
with a marshmallow.

00:09:36.170 --> 00:09:38.655
And I couldn't even get out of
the room before they ate it.

00:09:38.655 --> 00:09:39.154
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:39.654 --> 00:09:42.600
And you're about to see how
poorly this bodes for them.

00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:43.460
Sorry, guys.

00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:46.190
I shouldn't have mentioned you.

00:09:46.190 --> 00:09:48.100
Anyway, they do the
marshmallow test.

00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:50.183
They see how long kids can
resist the marshmallow.

00:09:50.183 --> 00:09:51.322
And then they come back.

00:09:51.322 --> 00:09:52.780
So for the examples
I'm giving you,

00:09:52.780 --> 00:09:58.345
they come back 10 years later
and see how they're doing.

00:09:58.345 --> 00:10:00.730
How long they can
resist this marshmallow

00:10:00.730 --> 00:10:05.150
predicts other outcomes
later in their life.

00:10:05.150 --> 00:10:07.190
So the two examples I'm
going to mention here

00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:12.210
are how well they do on
their SAT and their weight.

00:10:12.210 --> 00:10:14.410
And it turns out
that, first of all,

00:10:14.410 --> 00:10:17.560
willpower does predict
both of those things.

00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:20.062
So how long you can resist that
marshmallow at age four does

00:10:20.062 --> 00:10:21.270
predict each of those things.

00:10:21.270 --> 00:10:24.630
But absolutely,
importantly, willpower

00:10:24.630 --> 00:10:27.390
is way, way, way
better at predicting

00:10:27.390 --> 00:10:30.950
how well you do on the SAT
than your later weight.

00:10:30.950 --> 00:10:34.520
In fact, it's eight times better
at predicting your SAT scores

00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:35.670
than your weight.

00:10:35.670 --> 00:10:38.760
And to say that more
precisely, because that's not

00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:41.170
totally the right way
to say that, willpower

00:10:41.170 --> 00:10:46.090
explains 32% of the variation
between people in their SAT

00:10:46.090 --> 00:10:47.180
scores.

00:10:47.180 --> 00:10:50.300
A full third of the variation
between people and their SAT

00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:53.060
scores can be explained
by their willpower,

00:10:53.060 --> 00:10:55.210
by how well they do on
this marshmallow test.

00:10:55.210 --> 00:10:58.740
But willpower only explains 4%
of the variation between people

00:10:58.740 --> 00:11:01.391
and their weight, 4%.

00:11:01.391 --> 00:11:03.140
Willpower is supposed
to be the thing that

00:11:03.140 --> 00:11:04.770
matters the most
for people's weight

00:11:04.770 --> 00:11:08.530
and yet it only explains 4%
of the variation in weight.

00:11:08.530 --> 00:11:10.840
96% of the variation
in people's weight

00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:13.760
is from something
other than willpower.

00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:15.920
Now, I did not get
overly complicated.

00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:17.090
Just forget all that.

00:11:17.090 --> 00:11:18.820
I'll say it a different way.

00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:21.240
Here's my simple, but
I'm not going to lie,

00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:23.850
slightly obnoxious way
of remembering just

00:11:23.850 --> 00:11:27.330
how unimportant self-control
is when it comes to weight loss

00:11:27.330 --> 00:11:29.145
or maintaining weight loss.

00:11:29.145 --> 00:11:30.520
Now to appreciate
this, you first

00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:32.790
need to realize that
diets don't work

00:11:32.790 --> 00:11:35.720
in the long run for the
majority of dieters.

00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:37.762
So we reviewed all the
long-term studies of diet.

00:11:37.762 --> 00:11:39.469
Studies that looked
at people who went on

00:11:39.469 --> 00:11:42.000
diets and followed them for
at least two or more years.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.750
And what we found is
that by about three years

00:11:44.750 --> 00:11:47.550
after starting a diet,
the average dieter

00:11:47.550 --> 00:11:52.070
has regained everything
they lost, but two pounds.

00:11:52.070 --> 00:11:55.190
So basically, they've
gained it all back.

00:11:55.190 --> 00:11:59.140
So diets don't work in the long
run for the majority of people.

00:11:59.140 --> 00:12:03.030
And I've seen the number 5%
as the percent of dieters

00:12:03.030 --> 00:12:05.740
who actually keep weight
off in the long term

00:12:05.740 --> 00:12:08.594
or keep a lot of weight
off in the long term.

00:12:08.594 --> 00:12:10.010
So the minority
of people do that.

00:12:10.010 --> 00:12:12.080
Now, here's how you
know self-control

00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:14.450
doesn't matter all that much
when it comes to weight.

00:12:14.450 --> 00:12:17.980
There's a person who is
in this special minority

00:12:17.980 --> 00:12:21.910
of 5%, this 5% of people who
have taken off a lot of weight

00:12:21.910 --> 00:12:23.700
and kept it off.

00:12:23.700 --> 00:12:27.040
And that person is Bill Clinton.

00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:28.500
He became a vegan.

00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:30.340
He lost a bunch of
weight and kept it off

00:12:30.340 --> 00:12:31.620
for a very long time.

00:12:31.620 --> 00:12:32.350
That's great.

00:12:32.350 --> 00:12:32.950
Go Bill.

00:12:32.950 --> 00:12:33.590
I'm a fan.

00:12:33.590 --> 00:12:34.680
I voted for him.

00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:36.974
But this is not a
person who most of us

00:12:36.974 --> 00:12:38.640
associate with having
good self-control.

00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:39.770
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:39.770 --> 00:12:42.291
He's known-- and I
hate to say this.

00:12:42.291 --> 00:12:43.790
I'm told it's going
on the internet.

00:12:43.790 --> 00:12:46.120
But this is a man
whose trademark

00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:48.330
is that he had no self-control.

00:12:48.330 --> 00:12:49.730
That's his thing.

00:12:49.730 --> 00:12:51.530
But it doesn't matter.

00:12:51.530 --> 00:12:53.780
Because self-control is
only slightly related

00:12:53.780 --> 00:12:56.336
to weight and weight loss.

00:12:56.336 --> 00:12:57.960
If you've struggled
to take off weight,

00:12:57.960 --> 00:13:00.630
if you've struggled to keep
off weight that you lost,

00:13:00.630 --> 00:13:04.290
it is not because you have worse
willpower than everybody else.

00:13:04.290 --> 00:13:06.020
It's not because you
have a weaker will.

00:13:06.020 --> 00:13:07.790
It's not because you
have less self-control.

00:13:07.790 --> 00:13:10.081
I'm saying that over and over
in lots of different ways

00:13:10.081 --> 00:13:13.590
because it's an important point
that I want people to remember.

00:13:13.590 --> 00:13:16.580
If you can't keep weight off,
it's not because you're weak.

00:13:16.580 --> 00:13:17.360
It's not.

00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:18.500
So what is it because of?

00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:23.240
Well, before I answer that,
let me ask you guys a question.

00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:26.110
Do any of you know someone you
can just eat whatever they want

00:13:26.110 --> 00:13:28.030
and not get fat?

00:13:28.030 --> 00:13:29.200
Right, you do.

00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:32.450
Let the record show people
are all nodding or raising

00:13:32.450 --> 00:13:33.952
their hands.

00:13:33.952 --> 00:13:35.160
We all know people like this.

00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:36.997
And they don't even
exercise, right?

00:13:36.997 --> 00:13:38.580
And you've probably
never even thought

00:13:38.580 --> 00:13:40.520
about what that means,
aside from the fact

00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:43.087
that there is truly no
justice in the world.

00:13:43.087 --> 00:13:45.170
But aside from that, you've
probably never thought

00:13:45.170 --> 00:13:46.180
about what that means.

00:13:46.180 --> 00:13:49.600
Some of you might even be the
person that I'm describing.

00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:53.290
And again, keep it to yourself.

00:13:53.290 --> 00:13:54.160
Don't share it.

00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:57.210
Don't share it with the
room, just a little pointer.

00:13:57.210 --> 00:14:00.630
Now you know what else exists
is fat people, who don't eat

00:14:00.630 --> 00:14:02.940
that much but are still fat.

00:14:02.940 --> 00:14:04.790
For the longest time,
obesity researchers

00:14:04.790 --> 00:14:07.819
just flat-out denied that
this kind of person existed.

00:14:07.819 --> 00:14:10.360
When they did studies where they
had people record everything

00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:13.380
they ate for days, or
weeks, or months even,

00:14:13.380 --> 00:14:15.180
they'd find plenty
of fat people who

00:14:15.180 --> 00:14:17.470
weren't eating all that much.

00:14:17.470 --> 00:14:19.450
The majority weren't
eating a lot,

00:14:19.450 --> 00:14:22.760
weren't eating a ton of food
the way people would assume.

00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:24.300
And they would also
find fat people

00:14:24.300 --> 00:14:26.091
in their studies eating
even less than some

00:14:26.091 --> 00:14:27.920
of the thin people
in their studies.

00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:29.310
Now when obesity
researchers were

00:14:29.310 --> 00:14:33.820
faced with that kind of
evidence, what they concluded

00:14:33.820 --> 00:14:36.750
is that the fat
people were lying.

00:14:36.750 --> 00:14:42.590
We're so, so, so harsh,
just outrageously harsh,

00:14:42.590 --> 00:14:46.600
just above crazy, crazy.

00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:48.210
They're not lying.

00:14:48.210 --> 00:14:52.140
The lie is the thing that we've
all been taught is the gospel.

00:14:52.140 --> 00:14:54.510
The lie is that
anyone can get skinny.

00:14:54.510 --> 00:14:56.740
And all you need
to do to get skinny

00:14:56.740 --> 00:14:59.589
is to exercise off more
calories than you eat.

00:14:59.589 --> 00:15:00.630
We've all been told that.

00:15:00.630 --> 00:15:02.480
But if that were
true, how could we

00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:05.370
have thin people who eat
so much and never exercise

00:15:05.370 --> 00:15:07.030
without getting fat?

00:15:07.030 --> 00:15:07.970
How could that exist?

00:15:07.970 --> 00:15:08.820
It does exist.

00:15:08.820 --> 00:15:10.610
How could it if that were true?

00:15:10.610 --> 00:15:14.000
We couldn't have fat people
who don't eat that much

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:15.920
and stay fat.

00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:17.670
They don't eat that
much and not get thin.

00:15:17.670 --> 00:15:18.669
It wouldn't be possible.

00:15:18.669 --> 00:15:20.660
But these people do exist.

00:15:20.660 --> 00:15:22.620
And the reason
these things exist--

00:15:22.620 --> 00:15:26.640
the reason these people exist,
is a more appropriate way

00:15:26.640 --> 00:15:29.580
of saying that-- is because
your weight is influenced

00:15:29.580 --> 00:15:33.365
by so much more than just
the calories that come in

00:15:33.365 --> 00:15:37.440
and the calories that
you burn off exercising.

00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:40.200
So I was at an academic meeting
recently, just a few weeks ago.

00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:42.240
And somebody put up
this diagram showing

00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:45.540
all the different things
that influence obesity,

00:15:45.540 --> 00:15:50.840
just a simple little
diagram, crazy, crazy diet.

00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:53.200
Luckily, they put up
the simple diagram next.

00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:54.220
Here's their simple one.

00:15:54.220 --> 00:15:57.170
They even labeled
it "simple model."

00:15:57.170 --> 00:16:00.500
And don't need to pay attention
or look at this at all,

00:16:00.500 --> 00:16:04.350
other than knowing this
is the simple model.

00:16:04.350 --> 00:16:08.370
So a lot of these functions on
this little graph are genetic.

00:16:08.370 --> 00:16:11.080
Now, we know a lot about
the genetics of obesity.

00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:13.010
And originally, we
learned about it

00:16:13.010 --> 00:16:16.130
from studies of people
who were adopted.

00:16:16.130 --> 00:16:19.350
When kids are adopted, you
can compare their adult weight

00:16:19.350 --> 00:16:21.920
with the parents
who raised them,

00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:25.640
who set their eating habits,
set their eating environment.

00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:28.500
And you can compare their
weight with their birth parents,

00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:30.080
who they share genes with.

00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:33.670
And what you find is
that adopted kids,

00:16:33.670 --> 00:16:37.210
their adult weight
is much, much more

00:16:37.210 --> 00:16:40.650
highly correlated with their
birth parents, who again,

00:16:40.650 --> 00:16:44.420
never met, but they share
some genes, about 50%

00:16:44.420 --> 00:16:45.480
of their genes.

00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:48.000
Much closer to their
weight than the weight

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.660
of the adoptive parents,
who again are deciding

00:16:51.660 --> 00:16:54.910
what they eat most of the time.

00:16:54.910 --> 00:16:59.995
So that suggests genes
matter more than environment

00:16:59.995 --> 00:17:02.280
for this outcome, for weight.

00:17:02.280 --> 00:17:04.989
Now, we also know a lot
from studies of twins.

00:17:04.989 --> 00:17:06.780
My university, the
University of Minnesota,

00:17:06.780 --> 00:17:08.630
is the home of twin studies.

00:17:08.630 --> 00:17:11.270
Coincidentally, it's in
the Twin Cities, unrelated.

00:17:11.270 --> 00:17:13.339
It's a complete coincidence.

00:17:13.339 --> 00:17:15.720
Seriously, it's a
complete coincidence.

00:17:15.720 --> 00:17:18.650
And they originated the studies
of twins, identical twins

00:17:18.650 --> 00:17:22.099
reared apart, which if you think
about it is the perfect study.

00:17:22.099 --> 00:17:25.310
They share 100% of
their genes, but have

00:17:25.310 --> 00:17:26.660
different environments.

00:17:26.660 --> 00:17:29.990
So you can really separate
out genes from environment

00:17:29.990 --> 00:17:31.590
in that kind of study.

00:17:31.590 --> 00:17:35.010
And those kinds of studies
show the very powerful role

00:17:35.010 --> 00:17:37.340
that genetics play
in people's weight.

00:17:37.340 --> 00:17:38.459
These are identical twins.

00:17:38.459 --> 00:17:40.250
These are not identical
twins reared apart.

00:17:40.250 --> 00:17:41.940
I don't have pictures of those.

00:17:41.940 --> 00:17:43.440
But these are
identical twins, again

00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:45.450
sharing 100% of their genes.

00:17:45.450 --> 00:17:47.200
And you can see that
in most of the pairs,

00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:49.570
the weights are nearly
identical to each other.

00:17:49.570 --> 00:17:50.740
They're not all identical.

00:17:50.740 --> 00:17:52.610
They're not 100%
identical because genes

00:17:52.610 --> 00:17:56.380
don't explain 100% of
what your weight will be.

00:17:56.380 --> 00:17:58.070
But it plays a large role.

00:17:58.070 --> 00:17:59.840
These are fraternal twins.

00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:01.650
They share 50% of their genes.

00:18:01.650 --> 00:18:05.550
And you see they're not nearly
as similar to each other

00:18:05.550 --> 00:18:07.670
as those twins who
shared all their genes.

00:18:07.670 --> 00:18:09.690
OK, genes matter.

00:18:09.690 --> 00:18:11.720
They play an important role.

00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:14.090
Now when you say
something is genetic,

00:18:14.090 --> 00:18:17.080
people get this weird idea
that the thing is simply

00:18:17.080 --> 00:18:19.601
coded on one single gene.

00:18:19.601 --> 00:18:21.100
So with weight,
people think there's

00:18:21.100 --> 00:18:24.690
one gene and that gene says
this person will weigh 150

00:18:24.690 --> 00:18:26.870
pounds when they're full grown.

00:18:26.870 --> 00:18:29.270
Clearly, that's way too simple.

00:18:29.270 --> 00:18:31.590
In fact, there's over
100 different genes

00:18:31.590 --> 00:18:35.650
that are linked to obesity,
that we know of currently.

00:18:35.650 --> 00:18:37.980
Every year, they're finding
more and more genes.

00:18:37.980 --> 00:18:40.520
This graph just shows
the number of genes

00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:45.020
that they found that influence
susceptibility to obesity.

00:18:45.020 --> 00:18:48.800
And they're finding more
and more, at quite a pace.

00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:54.110
2013 to '15, they
found a lot of genes.

00:18:54.110 --> 00:18:56.270
So what are these things
that are coded on genes?

00:18:56.270 --> 00:19:00.280
Well, let's start with hormones.

00:19:00.280 --> 00:19:03.870
So the relative levels
and responsiveness

00:19:03.870 --> 00:19:07.680
of dozens of different hormones
are coded on our genes,

00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:10.600
including these hormones of the
gastrointestinal system known

00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:12.810
as the gut hormones.

00:19:12.810 --> 00:19:15.216
And there's a
whole lot of these.

00:19:15.216 --> 00:19:18.000
So some of these hormones
determine how much

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:20.310
you need to eat to feel full.

00:19:20.310 --> 00:19:22.930
Some determine when you're
going to feel hungry

00:19:22.930 --> 00:19:25.280
and when you're not
going to feel hungry.

00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:28.960
Some people might feel full
from eating one sandwich.

00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:31.210
Other people of
the same size may

00:19:31.210 --> 00:19:34.399
need to eat three
sandwiches to feel full.

00:19:34.399 --> 00:19:35.940
They may need to
eat three sandwiches

00:19:35.940 --> 00:19:39.340
before their satiety
hormone kicks in.

00:19:39.340 --> 00:19:43.390
If one sandwich fills you up,
you are less likely to overeat.

00:19:43.390 --> 00:19:46.560
And it's because of these
genetically determined hormone

00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:47.880
differences.

00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:49.520
What are you supposed
to do if you need

00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:51.440
three sandwiches to feel full?

00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:54.450
Are you supposed to only
eat one and live hungry?

00:19:54.450 --> 00:19:57.010
Are you supposed to live
never feeling sated,

00:19:57.010 --> 00:19:59.552
never feeling full?

00:19:59.552 --> 00:20:00.260
Just consider it.

00:20:00.260 --> 00:20:03.540
Think about it later,
on your own time.

00:20:03.540 --> 00:20:05.690
If you think it's fair
or appropriate for us

00:20:05.690 --> 00:20:08.610
as a society to expect
some people to never

00:20:08.610 --> 00:20:11.600
feel full, to
always feel hungry,

00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:14.530
just to achieve
a certain weight?

00:20:14.530 --> 00:20:15.515
I'm not sure.

00:20:15.515 --> 00:20:17.699
I'm not sure that's OK.

00:20:17.699 --> 00:20:19.240
Now, another thing
hormones influence

00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:22.460
is which foods you like
and which foods you want,

00:20:22.460 --> 00:20:25.830
how palatable you
find different foods.

00:20:25.830 --> 00:20:28.776
If you've ever been pregnant,
you've experienced this.

00:20:28.776 --> 00:20:30.150
If you've ever
been pregnant, you

00:20:30.150 --> 00:20:33.590
know that this has
to do with hormones.

00:20:33.590 --> 00:20:36.410
When I was pregnant, all I
wanted to eat were apples.

00:20:36.410 --> 00:20:39.330
Apples, normally who
could care about apples?

00:20:39.330 --> 00:20:42.360
Normally, I wanted
ice cream, cookies.

00:20:42.360 --> 00:20:44.870
But when I was pregnant, I had
no interest in those things.

00:20:44.870 --> 00:20:46.820
All I wanted were apples.

00:20:46.820 --> 00:20:49.140
Hormones clearly
have something to do

00:20:49.140 --> 00:20:51.681
with that food preference.

00:20:51.681 --> 00:20:53.680
So for some people, it's
going to be much easier

00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:56.900
to resist ice cream than
it is for other people.

00:20:56.900 --> 00:21:00.630
But it won't be because of
their impressive self-control.

00:21:00.630 --> 00:21:04.119
They might tell you it's
because of their self-control.

00:21:04.119 --> 00:21:06.410
But really, it's because they
weren't as tempted by it.

00:21:06.410 --> 00:21:08.430
It didn't look as good to them.

00:21:08.430 --> 00:21:10.360
It's not calling
out to them, the way

00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:11.690
it calls out to some of us.

00:21:11.690 --> 00:21:14.100
It doesn't seem as appealing.

00:21:14.100 --> 00:21:16.550
You know how they say it
doesn't count as bravery if you

00:21:16.550 --> 00:21:18.400
weren't afraid to begin with?

00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:19.650
It's the same thing.

00:21:19.650 --> 00:21:21.770
It's not self-control
if you didn't want

00:21:21.770 --> 00:21:23.360
the thing in the first place.

00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:24.890
That's not self-control.

00:21:24.890 --> 00:21:26.930
That's just a different palate.

00:21:26.930 --> 00:21:32.390
It's just a different set of
genetically based preferences.

00:21:32.390 --> 00:21:34.830
Now you know you know
people like this, of course.

00:21:34.830 --> 00:21:36.330
You'll be in a
restaurant with them.

00:21:36.330 --> 00:21:39.370
And when it's time to order
dessert, they'll say, oh, no.

00:21:39.370 --> 00:21:41.070
I could never eat
chocolate mousse.

00:21:41.070 --> 00:21:42.870
That's just--

00:21:42.870 --> 00:21:46.350
I have people in
my own home who say

00:21:46.350 --> 00:21:49.340
I could never eat marshmallow
Peeps for breakfast.

00:21:49.340 --> 00:21:50.432
That's crazy.

00:21:50.432 --> 00:21:53.040
Ah, that's so annoying.

00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:54.410
OK, people, whatever.

00:21:54.410 --> 00:21:56.010
People have different
preferences.

00:21:56.010 --> 00:21:58.228
So those are
hormonal differences.

00:21:58.228 --> 00:22:00.520
And there's also
neural differences,

00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:02.040
neurological differences.

00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:05.510
So people differ in their
brain's responsiveness

00:22:05.510 --> 00:22:09.230
to the sight of food and to
the sight of different foods.

00:22:09.230 --> 00:22:11.340
So some people get a
big reward response

00:22:11.340 --> 00:22:12.610
from seeing or eating food.

00:22:12.610 --> 00:22:15.094
They get a big rush of dopamine.

00:22:15.094 --> 00:22:16.760
Now you guys know
about dopamine, right?

00:22:16.760 --> 00:22:19.220
It's this neurotransmitter
associated with reward,

00:22:19.220 --> 00:22:21.710
with pleasure, with addiction.

00:22:21.710 --> 00:22:26.080
People get a big dopamine rush
from drugs they're addicted to.

00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:28.950
So some people get a
bigger dopamine rush

00:22:28.950 --> 00:22:32.190
from certain foods
than other people.

00:22:32.190 --> 00:22:35.230
So the bigger this response,
the bigger the reward response,

00:22:35.230 --> 00:22:39.380
the more pleasing you
find it to have this food.

00:22:39.380 --> 00:22:43.360
The more you crave this
food, the more difficult

00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:46.909
it's going to be for you to
resist it, if it's present.

00:22:46.909 --> 00:22:48.950
There's a lot of different
neurological functions

00:22:48.950 --> 00:22:51.120
that influence people's
susceptibility to obesity.

00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:54.209
I'm literally just naming
that one, the reward response.

00:22:54.209 --> 00:22:55.000
There's others too.

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:58.110
Actually, we'll mention
another one in a second.

00:22:58.110 --> 00:23:01.150
So neurological responses to
foods have a genetic basis.

00:23:01.150 --> 00:23:04.840
And then metabolism-- and,
of course, your metabolism

00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:05.930
is genetically based.

00:23:05.930 --> 00:23:07.830
And you guys all know
about metabolism.

00:23:07.830 --> 00:23:10.700
Your metabolism determines
how efficiently you

00:23:10.700 --> 00:23:12.876
use the calories that come in.

00:23:12.876 --> 00:23:14.810
And it determines
how many calories

00:23:14.810 --> 00:23:18.040
you burn just doing
the job of running

00:23:18.040 --> 00:23:19.637
the systems of your body.

00:23:19.637 --> 00:23:21.970
So some people are going to
burn up more of the calories

00:23:21.970 --> 00:23:24.610
from that donut
than other people,

00:23:24.610 --> 00:23:27.370
just while sitting still.

00:23:27.370 --> 00:23:30.400
And this is how you can
have people who eat a lot

00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:34.930
and remain thin and people who
are fat, who don't eat a lot.

00:23:34.930 --> 00:23:38.410
You can put people
on the same diet

00:23:38.410 --> 00:23:41.670
and completely different things
will happen to their weight.

00:23:41.670 --> 00:23:43.410
So this is a graph
that shows what

00:23:43.410 --> 00:23:45.640
happened to 29
different people, who

00:23:45.640 --> 00:23:50.100
were put on the exact same, very
low-calorie diet for 10 weeks.

00:23:50.100 --> 00:23:53.020
This is their weight change
in terms of the percent

00:23:53.020 --> 00:23:55.040
of their starting weight.

00:23:55.040 --> 00:23:57.850
So each bar is a
different person.

00:23:57.850 --> 00:24:00.360
And what you can see is
that different things

00:24:00.360 --> 00:24:01.690
happen for different people.

00:24:01.690 --> 00:24:04.080
Some lost a lot of weight,
some lost a little weight,

00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:06.430
and some gained weight.

00:24:06.430 --> 00:24:08.390
When you see graphs
like this, people

00:24:08.390 --> 00:24:10.170
say, well, I bet
some of those people

00:24:10.170 --> 00:24:13.370
lied and ate more than
they were supposed to.

00:24:13.370 --> 00:24:16.100
And certainly, this is
possible on any diet study,

00:24:16.100 --> 00:24:16.850
for the most part.

00:24:16.850 --> 00:24:20.980
But they've also done studies
where the person checks

00:24:20.980 --> 00:24:24.946
into the researcher's clinic,
to a diet clinic, to a hospital,

00:24:24.946 --> 00:24:25.570
whatever it is.

00:24:25.570 --> 00:24:27.611
And they live there for
the duration of the diet.

00:24:27.611 --> 00:24:30.010
And they only eat the food
the researchers give them.

00:24:30.010 --> 00:24:31.970
And you still get
this wide variation

00:24:31.970 --> 00:24:34.176
in what happens to people.

00:24:34.176 --> 00:24:38.270
Now, the same is also
true for overeating.

00:24:38.270 --> 00:24:42.650
So this next graph is from a
study where researchers first

00:24:42.650 --> 00:24:44.760
figured out the exact
number of calories

00:24:44.760 --> 00:24:48.659
to give people so that their
weight would stay the same.

00:24:48.659 --> 00:24:49.700
So they figured that out.

00:24:49.700 --> 00:24:52.140
And then they
overfed each of them

00:24:52.140 --> 00:24:56.200
a thousand more calories
per day for a hundred days.

00:24:56.200 --> 00:24:58.870
And they didn't allow
them to exercise.

00:24:58.870 --> 00:25:01.380
So each-- by now, it's like
who is volunteering here?

00:25:04.560 --> 00:25:06.520
Again, each bar is
a different person.

00:25:06.520 --> 00:25:10.450
And again, you see
this big variation.

00:25:10.450 --> 00:25:13.630
Some people gained as much
as 30 pounds in the 100 days.

00:25:13.630 --> 00:25:16.380
Some gained as
this little as 10.

00:25:16.380 --> 00:25:19.530
And-- not that we're going
to talk about exercise today

00:25:19.530 --> 00:25:20.060
exactly.

00:25:20.060 --> 00:25:22.930
But the same thing is
also true for exercise.

00:25:22.930 --> 00:25:25.640
And this graph is from an
exercise study, where everyone

00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:27.860
did the same intensity
exercise for 12

00:25:27.860 --> 00:25:30.450
weeks in the
researcher's clinic,

00:25:30.450 --> 00:25:32.530
in front of the researchers.

00:25:32.530 --> 00:25:35.390
And some people lost a lot of
weight, some lost a little,

00:25:35.390 --> 00:25:36.420
and some gained.

00:25:36.420 --> 00:25:38.290
And the reason there's
two colored bars

00:25:38.290 --> 00:25:41.700
is because one is their weight
and one is their fat mass.

00:25:41.700 --> 00:25:43.920
Either way, the
same point is made,

00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:46.450
whichever one you look at.

00:25:46.450 --> 00:25:49.760
So first point, your weight
is based on a lot more

00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:52.360
than calories in, calories out.

00:25:52.360 --> 00:25:56.030
And genetically-based factors
affect so many aspects of it,

00:25:56.030 --> 00:25:58.220
including things like
how tempting a food looks

00:25:58.220 --> 00:26:02.470
to you, how rewarding that food
is to you, how much you crave

00:26:02.470 --> 00:26:05.540
it, how hungry you feel
after eating the same food,

00:26:05.540 --> 00:26:07.110
and the rate at
which you burn up

00:26:07.110 --> 00:26:10.250
the calories from
that same food.

00:26:10.250 --> 00:26:13.080
If you're a thin
person, you're probably

00:26:13.080 --> 00:26:17.122
on the lucky side of a lot of
those, if not all of those.

00:26:17.122 --> 00:26:20.970
You're probably on the side that
makes it easy to resist food,

00:26:20.970 --> 00:26:24.800
makes it easy to burn calories,
makes it easy to remain thin.

00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:27.050
If you're a fat person,
if you're an obese person,

00:26:27.050 --> 00:26:28.940
odds are you're on
the other side of

00:26:28.940 --> 00:26:31.370
that, the side that
makes it difficult.

00:26:31.370 --> 00:26:35.420
It seems crazy to blame
people for their fatness

00:26:35.420 --> 00:26:38.510
or be impressed
by their thinness.

00:26:38.510 --> 00:26:43.091
It is way less about
them than it seems.

00:26:43.091 --> 00:26:43.590
OK.

00:26:43.590 --> 00:26:44.510
So that was point one.

00:26:44.510 --> 00:26:46.760
Now, point two is where--
and there's only two points.

00:26:46.760 --> 00:26:48.710
Point two is where
things get really

00:26:48.710 --> 00:26:52.670
frustrating because regardless
of where you start out

00:26:52.670 --> 00:26:55.870
on these biological factors
here, regardless of where

00:26:55.870 --> 00:27:00.230
your genes put you, there is
one thing that reliably messes

00:27:00.230 --> 00:27:02.910
these things up for everybody.

00:27:02.910 --> 00:27:05.580
And that one thing is dieting.

00:27:05.580 --> 00:27:07.680
And so if you restrict
your eating for a while

00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:09.880
and lose some
weight, if your body

00:27:09.880 --> 00:27:12.790
detects that not enough
calories are coming in,

00:27:12.790 --> 00:27:16.220
all of these biological
factors change for the worse.

00:27:16.220 --> 00:27:18.690
They change in the way
that undermines your effort

00:27:18.690 --> 00:27:20.100
to keep weight off.

00:27:20.100 --> 00:27:22.180
And this is why diets
don't work in the long run

00:27:22.180 --> 00:27:24.470
for the large
majority of people.

00:27:24.470 --> 00:27:26.380
So after losing
weight, your metabolism

00:27:26.380 --> 00:27:30.120
changes so that you run
your body on fewer calories

00:27:30.120 --> 00:27:34.102
than before, leaving more left
over, unused, to store as fat.

00:27:34.102 --> 00:27:35.810
So if you eat the same
amount of calories

00:27:35.810 --> 00:27:38.930
that you were eating when
you lost weight on your diet,

00:27:38.930 --> 00:27:41.460
after a while you'll
stop losing weight.

00:27:41.460 --> 00:27:42.960
You might even start
gaining weight.

00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:46.740
They sometimes call
this the plateau.

00:27:46.740 --> 00:27:48.570
And what will people say?

00:27:48.570 --> 00:27:50.585
They'll say you had
no self-control.

00:27:50.585 --> 00:27:51.960
They'll say you
couldn't hack it.

00:27:51.960 --> 00:27:52.751
You couldn't do it.

00:27:52.751 --> 00:27:54.040
You were weak.

00:27:54.040 --> 00:27:57.090
Even though you're eating
so little, and probably even

00:27:57.090 --> 00:28:01.280
eating less than they're eating,
if they're not on a diet.

00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:02.680
So that's metabolism.

00:28:02.680 --> 00:28:05.310
After losing weight, your
hormone levels change.

00:28:05.310 --> 00:28:08.200
So you're more likely
to feel hungry.

00:28:08.200 --> 00:28:11.860
You need to eat more
to feel full than you

00:28:11.860 --> 00:28:13.702
than you used to,
than before dieting.

00:28:13.702 --> 00:28:15.410
So if you eat the same
amount of calories

00:28:15.410 --> 00:28:17.242
you ate to lose
weight, you're going

00:28:17.242 --> 00:28:18.950
to feel even hungrier
than you felt then.

00:28:18.950 --> 00:28:20.630
You probably felt hungry
then because you weren't

00:28:20.630 --> 00:28:21.730
eating that many calories.

00:28:21.730 --> 00:28:23.540
Now, you're even hungrier.

00:28:23.540 --> 00:28:27.360
To keep weight off, you
have to always be hungry.

00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:30.300
After losing weight,
also your brain changes.

00:28:30.300 --> 00:28:33.210
It changes in ways that
make food more tempting.

00:28:33.210 --> 00:28:35.620
And you become
preoccupied with food.

00:28:35.620 --> 00:28:38.360
And there's all kinds
of evidence for this.

00:28:38.360 --> 00:28:40.910
But the earliest kind
of evidence for this,

00:28:40.910 --> 00:28:43.420
and the kind that I think
is the most fun is-- OK,

00:28:43.420 --> 00:28:44.910
that's going to
seem inappropriate.

00:28:44.910 --> 00:28:47.860
But it is the kind that
you find in journals

00:28:47.860 --> 00:28:50.370
that explorers leave.

00:28:50.370 --> 00:28:52.730
Explorers are actually
convenient people

00:28:52.730 --> 00:28:54.880
to study when it comes to
the effects of starvation

00:28:54.880 --> 00:28:58.540
because, unfortunately,
explorers do two things.

00:28:58.540 --> 00:29:02.110
One is that they keep journals,
where they're very precise.

00:29:02.110 --> 00:29:05.410
And another is that
they die of starvation.

00:29:05.410 --> 00:29:09.800
So you can read their journals
and learn a lot from them.

00:29:09.800 --> 00:29:13.060
And what you find is they
talk about food a lot.

00:29:13.060 --> 00:29:15.140
They mention
dreaming about food.

00:29:15.140 --> 00:29:16.890
They write about
their favorite meals.

00:29:16.890 --> 00:29:19.140
They write about what the
first thing they want to eat

00:29:19.140 --> 00:29:20.730
is when they get home, all this.

00:29:20.730 --> 00:29:23.860
This guy, this slide
is Robert Falcon Scott.

00:29:23.860 --> 00:29:25.570
He's a polar explorer.

00:29:25.570 --> 00:29:28.170
And I feel like-- he's
not so famous in the US.

00:29:28.170 --> 00:29:29.690
He's extremely
famous in England.

00:29:29.690 --> 00:29:31.840
He's British.

00:29:31.840 --> 00:29:35.720
And the reason he's not so
famous outside of England,

00:29:35.720 --> 00:29:38.600
outside of his home, is
because he came in second.

00:29:38.600 --> 00:29:40.710
And coming in second,
for an explorer,

00:29:40.710 --> 00:29:42.920
it's like not exploring at all.

00:29:42.920 --> 00:29:45.610
It's either you're the first
one there or you're not.

00:29:45.610 --> 00:29:47.380
And you discovered
it or you didn't.

00:29:47.380 --> 00:29:50.280
His team unfortunately got
beaten to the South Pole

00:29:50.280 --> 00:29:52.470
by 28 days.

00:29:52.470 --> 00:29:57.380
And unfortunately, also,
they died on their way back.

00:29:57.380 --> 00:30:00.000
They starved/froze to death.

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:03.060
Polar exploring is insane.

00:30:03.060 --> 00:30:06.310
I mean-- it's--
yeah, yeah, anyway.

00:30:06.310 --> 00:30:07.910
I'm an indoor person-- so maybe.

00:30:07.910 --> 00:30:11.280
It just seems really
extremely extra crazy to me.

00:30:11.280 --> 00:30:12.870
Anyway, Scott's
journal-- and there's

00:30:12.870 --> 00:30:14.994
a whole museum devoted
to him in Cambridge.

00:30:14.994 --> 00:30:16.410
This is where I
was on sabbatical.

00:30:16.410 --> 00:30:18.980
And it's fun to
read his diaries.

00:30:18.980 --> 00:30:21.210
I mean-- OK, again,
it sounds horrible.

00:30:21.210 --> 00:30:22.940
They're fascinating.

00:30:22.940 --> 00:30:24.440
It's not grisly.

00:30:24.440 --> 00:30:26.430
It's just a very
interesting thing.

00:30:26.430 --> 00:30:28.880
He's extremely tough
and not whining

00:30:28.880 --> 00:30:31.089
in any sense of the word.

00:30:31.089 --> 00:30:32.630
Anyway, you don't
have to be starving

00:30:32.630 --> 00:30:35.660
to death for these
neurological changes to happen.

00:30:35.660 --> 00:30:37.520
They happen when you
lose weight, even just

00:30:37.520 --> 00:30:38.580
a little weight.

00:30:38.580 --> 00:30:41.715
They happen when you're
depriving yourself of food.

00:30:41.715 --> 00:30:44.250
And what happens is-- and
every dieter will tell you

00:30:44.250 --> 00:30:44.840
this happens.

00:30:44.840 --> 00:30:46.750
You think about food constantly.

00:30:46.750 --> 00:30:49.430
You're more likely to
notice it if it's there.

00:30:49.430 --> 00:30:52.830
And eating food gives you an
even stronger reward response

00:30:52.830 --> 00:30:53.940
than before dieting.

00:30:53.940 --> 00:30:58.520
And this is not ideal, if
you're trying to keep dieting.

00:30:58.520 --> 00:30:59.020
OK.

00:30:59.020 --> 00:31:01.260
So point two is
that dieting leads

00:31:01.260 --> 00:31:04.480
to biological changes that make
it incredibly difficult to keep

00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:05.430
weight off.

00:31:05.430 --> 00:31:08.970
Just that small minority
of people manage to do it.

00:31:08.970 --> 00:31:12.480
And to do it, they have to go
about their lives basically

00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:17.260
devoted to this, devoted to
eating very, very little,

00:31:17.260 --> 00:31:20.680
to always feeling hungry, and
constantly thinking about food.

00:31:20.680 --> 00:31:24.560
Basically fighting against all
of these things in these red

00:31:24.560 --> 00:31:26.550
bubbles here.

00:31:26.550 --> 00:31:31.930
Now, knowing about these things
makes me just screaming mad

00:31:31.930 --> 00:31:35.210
when people blame dieters for
regaining weight they lost.

00:31:35.210 --> 00:31:36.050
I just-- ugh.

00:31:36.050 --> 00:31:37.780
I cannot take it
when people say--

00:31:37.780 --> 00:31:40.160
and this is the thing that
people are constantly saying

00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:43.440
or putting in comments when
I talk at other places.

00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:45.360
They say, well,
they're in the end,

00:31:45.360 --> 00:31:48.860
they're still the one holding
the fork and shoveling it in.

00:31:48.860 --> 00:31:51.390
It just makes me absolutely
want to throttle them.

00:31:51.390 --> 00:31:53.160
Yes, I will give them this.

00:31:53.160 --> 00:31:54.710
They are holding the fork.

00:31:54.710 --> 00:31:55.680
I will give them that.

00:31:55.680 --> 00:31:56.450
Yes, it's true.

00:31:56.450 --> 00:31:59.760
But they are holding that
fork in a completely different

00:31:59.760 --> 00:32:02.210
physiological
context than someone

00:32:02.210 --> 00:32:04.400
who hasn't been dieting.

00:32:04.400 --> 00:32:07.010
In this context,
they're holding the fork

00:32:07.010 --> 00:32:10.520
in a context in which their
biology has turned on them.

00:32:10.520 --> 00:32:14.030
And to succeed, they have
to battle against all

00:32:14.030 --> 00:32:15.450
these biological factors.

00:32:15.450 --> 00:32:17.440
So if you've been
dieting, you hold the fork

00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:20.450
in a context in which your
hormones are preventing you

00:32:20.450 --> 00:32:24.620
from feeling full and
causing you to feel hungry,

00:32:24.620 --> 00:32:28.690
to feel extremely hungry,
no matter what you eat.

00:32:28.690 --> 00:32:30.190
You're holding the
fork in a context

00:32:30.190 --> 00:32:32.480
in which your brain is more
likely to notice foods,

00:32:32.480 --> 00:32:33.240
if they're there.

00:32:33.240 --> 00:32:36.130
It pays extreme attention
to thoughts of food

00:32:36.130 --> 00:32:39.740
and can't really be shaken from
those thoughts very easily.

00:32:39.740 --> 00:32:42.220
And you hold the fork in the
context in which your brain is

00:32:42.220 --> 00:32:44.310
responding to food,
with a bigger,

00:32:44.310 --> 00:32:48.250
more powerful hit of
reward, with extra pleasure

00:32:48.250 --> 00:32:49.570
and extra reinforcement.

00:32:49.570 --> 00:32:52.890
So, yes, fine, that
they held the fork.

00:32:52.890 --> 00:32:55.990
But it's this
physiological situation

00:32:55.990 --> 00:33:00.290
that made them so
likely to pick it up.

00:33:00.290 --> 00:33:02.060
So I thought this
information was

00:33:02.060 --> 00:33:04.330
something people
should know, something

00:33:04.330 --> 00:33:06.730
that people should hear about.

00:33:06.730 --> 00:33:09.230
So 11 years ago, I
wrote a book proposal

00:33:09.230 --> 00:33:10.840
about why diets don't work.

00:33:10.840 --> 00:33:14.660
And no publisher
would come near it.

00:33:14.660 --> 00:33:18.230
They did not want a book that
started with the three words,

00:33:18.230 --> 00:33:20.490
diets don't work.

00:33:20.490 --> 00:33:23.550
They just said that is too
bad, that is too negative,

00:33:23.550 --> 00:33:25.350
that's too much bad news.

00:33:25.350 --> 00:33:27.047
Nobody wants to read bad news.

00:33:27.047 --> 00:33:28.380
No one's going to read bad news.

00:33:28.380 --> 00:33:29.065
Forget it.

00:33:29.065 --> 00:33:31.340
And this absolutely
drove me nuts.

00:33:31.340 --> 00:33:33.770
Because first of all, I
don't think it's bad news.

00:33:33.770 --> 00:33:36.040
I don't think it's
bad news to learn

00:33:36.040 --> 00:33:39.060
that it's not your fault if
you gain weight, that it's not

00:33:39.060 --> 00:33:41.070
your fault if you
find it difficult.

00:33:41.070 --> 00:33:42.490
That it's not
because you're weak.

00:33:42.490 --> 00:33:44.670
It's not a personal failing.

00:33:44.670 --> 00:33:48.980
It's because you are a
biological human being.

00:33:48.980 --> 00:33:53.860
Now secondly, people deserve
and want to know what's true.

00:33:53.860 --> 00:33:56.042
I fully believe this, whether
or not it's good news.

00:33:56.042 --> 00:33:57.750
Whether or not they're
going to interpret

00:33:57.750 --> 00:33:59.530
it as positive or
negative, people still

00:33:59.530 --> 00:34:00.920
want to know what's true.

00:34:00.920 --> 00:34:02.670
And they should have
the right to hear it.

00:34:02.670 --> 00:34:06.130
And they should have access to
accurate information about it.

00:34:06.130 --> 00:34:08.679
Very hard to get accurate
information about diets

00:34:08.679 --> 00:34:09.179
out there.

00:34:09.179 --> 00:34:11.340
So tons of information
is out there.

00:34:11.340 --> 00:34:14.360
But most of it is designed to
sell you something, generally

00:34:14.360 --> 00:34:15.270
a diet.

00:34:15.270 --> 00:34:17.840
So you're not getting accurate
information about diets.

00:34:17.840 --> 00:34:22.060
It seems that this is something
people should have access to.

00:34:22.060 --> 00:34:25.040
And the thing that drove me
the most bonkers at the time

00:34:25.040 --> 00:34:29.960
is that the book that was on
top of the bestseller list,

00:34:29.960 --> 00:34:32.790
at the time that I was being
told that people don't want

00:34:32.790 --> 00:34:35.199
to read bad news, was
a book that I think

00:34:35.199 --> 00:34:39.230
is like the ultimate
in bad news.

00:34:39.230 --> 00:34:41.219
Anyone guess what
that book might

00:34:41.219 --> 00:34:45.870
have been, bestseller
10 or so years ago,

00:34:45.870 --> 00:34:49.610
super-bad news right
there in the title?

00:34:49.610 --> 00:34:50.110
No.

00:34:50.110 --> 00:34:52.040
My husband guessed
"Tuesdays with Morrie,"

00:34:52.040 --> 00:34:55.030
which is incorrect.

00:34:55.030 --> 00:34:59.560
It's this book, "He's
Just Not That into You."

00:34:59.560 --> 00:35:00.390
Come on.

00:35:00.390 --> 00:35:03.260
That is the worst news.

00:35:03.260 --> 00:35:08.000
Jeez, very annoying, but
also extremely disappointing.

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:10.470
The only reason I was
eventually able to publish

00:35:10.470 --> 00:35:13.990
this book at all is that
for the last 10 years,

00:35:13.990 --> 00:35:15.500
I gave up on willpower.

00:35:15.500 --> 00:35:16.880
I gave up on self-control.

00:35:16.880 --> 00:35:19.200
And instead, I started
researching strategies

00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:22.120
for healthy eating that
don't involve willpower

00:35:22.120 --> 00:35:24.310
and that don't involve
dieting, ways to get

00:35:24.310 --> 00:35:26.960
you to eat more healthy stuff.

00:35:26.960 --> 00:35:29.410
And the goal of all these
strategies-- and I'll

00:35:29.410 --> 00:35:32.089
tell you two of them-- and
the goal of these strategies

00:35:32.089 --> 00:35:33.880
is to help you reach
what I'm going to call

00:35:33.880 --> 00:35:35.950
your leanest livable weight.

00:35:35.950 --> 00:35:39.930
This is the weight at the lower
end of your set weight range.

00:35:39.930 --> 00:35:41.800
You do have a set
range of weights,

00:35:41.800 --> 00:35:43.800
that's basically
biologically determined,

00:35:43.800 --> 00:35:46.722
that your body basically
tries to keep you within.

00:35:46.722 --> 00:35:48.180
Your leanest livable
weight will be

00:35:48.180 --> 00:35:51.137
at the low end of that
range, rather than below it.

00:35:51.137 --> 00:35:53.470
This is the lowest weight you
can be without setting off

00:35:53.470 --> 00:35:57.050
all those biological changes,
from the red bubbles,

00:35:57.050 --> 00:35:59.340
that dieting causes.

00:35:59.340 --> 00:36:01.550
Those changes, again
they happen when

00:36:01.550 --> 00:36:04.170
you try to live below
that set weight range.

00:36:04.170 --> 00:36:08.560
So aim to stay within it,
but at the low end of it.

00:36:08.560 --> 00:36:13.290
Now, this might not be as
low as your usual diet goal.

00:36:13.290 --> 00:36:17.270
This might not be the same
as your ideal goal weight.

00:36:17.270 --> 00:36:20.060
But I want to encourage
people to think

00:36:20.060 --> 00:36:23.010
of that as the best
weight for them

00:36:23.010 --> 00:36:24.734
and to aim for that weight.

00:36:24.734 --> 00:36:26.400
Because that's a
weight you can maintain

00:36:26.400 --> 00:36:27.910
without it taking
over your life,

00:36:27.910 --> 00:36:30.230
if you do some healthy stuff.

00:36:30.230 --> 00:36:33.140
And it's a weight that
you can be healthy at.

00:36:33.140 --> 00:36:36.330
You don't have to get skinny
to be healthy, absolutely not.

00:36:36.330 --> 00:36:39.420
You can be healthy
at any weight.

00:36:39.420 --> 00:36:42.860
So we need something between
this damaging restrictive

00:36:42.860 --> 00:36:44.610
dieting, that's
always encouraged,

00:36:44.610 --> 00:36:47.160
and just kind of
letting everything go.

00:36:47.160 --> 00:36:48.650
And so this is
what I'm proposing

00:36:48.650 --> 00:36:50.395
to be in the sensible middle.

00:36:50.395 --> 00:36:52.020
So I'm going to end
just by telling you

00:36:52.020 --> 00:36:54.720
about a couple strategies.

00:36:54.720 --> 00:36:55.860
OK.

00:36:55.860 --> 00:36:59.890
So some of the
strategies basically

00:36:59.890 --> 00:37:03.050
are trying to take
advantage of obstacles.

00:37:03.050 --> 00:37:07.570
There are ways to put obstacles
between you and tempting food.

00:37:07.570 --> 00:37:10.540
And these strategies work
extremely well because we--

00:37:10.540 --> 00:37:14.670
and by we, I mean humans.

00:37:14.670 --> 00:37:18.495
We tend to be lazy.

00:37:18.495 --> 00:37:19.370
I'm not going to lie.

00:37:19.370 --> 00:37:20.350
We tend to be lazy.

00:37:20.350 --> 00:37:25.210
So obstacles usually slow us
down, if not stop us entirely.

00:37:25.210 --> 00:37:28.580
So, for example, there's a study
from the Netherlands where they

00:37:28.580 --> 00:37:31.360
show that if you have
a bowl of M&amp;M's-- oh,

00:37:31.360 --> 00:37:34.070
if you have a bowl of M&amp;M's
across the room from where

00:37:34.070 --> 00:37:37.530
you're sitting, you're not going
to eat as many as if the bowl

00:37:37.530 --> 00:37:39.575
is right there next
to you at the table.

00:37:39.575 --> 00:37:41.950
If it's five feet across the
room, you won't eat as many.

00:37:41.950 --> 00:37:44.610
You'll eat half as
many, having to get up

00:37:44.610 --> 00:37:45.820
to stop what you're doing.

00:37:45.820 --> 00:37:46.700
You have to get up.

00:37:46.700 --> 00:37:48.380
You have to walk
across the room.

00:37:48.380 --> 00:37:49.840
That's a giant obstacle.

00:37:49.840 --> 00:37:52.980
It turns out you don't
need such a big obstacle

00:37:52.980 --> 00:37:56.960
to cut in half the
amount of M&amp;M's you need.

00:37:56.960 --> 00:38:00.810
That same study also
tested a smaller obstacle.

00:38:00.810 --> 00:38:03.130
They put the bowl of M&amp;M's,
instead of right here

00:38:03.130 --> 00:38:05.560
by your hand, they
put it so that you

00:38:05.560 --> 00:38:08.530
had to reach two feet
across the table for it.

00:38:08.530 --> 00:38:11.130
You basically had
to extend your arm.

00:38:11.130 --> 00:38:14.290
And if you had to lean forward
a little and extend your arm,

00:38:14.290 --> 00:38:18.340
you ate just as few as if it
was fully across the room.

00:38:18.340 --> 00:38:21.100
So this little change
made a huge difference,

00:38:21.100 --> 00:38:24.350
as much of a difference again
as actually stopping what

00:38:24.350 --> 00:38:25.922
you're doing and getting up.

00:38:25.922 --> 00:38:27.880
Does this keep you from
eating any M&amp;Ms at all?

00:38:27.880 --> 00:38:28.970
No.

00:38:28.970 --> 00:38:31.560
But it helps you eat a lot less.

00:38:31.560 --> 00:38:36.720
And eating less seems
like a really good goal,

00:38:36.720 --> 00:38:39.310
eating less, but not none.

00:38:39.310 --> 00:38:42.140
None, come on.

00:38:42.140 --> 00:38:44.640
People need to enjoy their life.

00:38:44.640 --> 00:38:47.910
I think anything saying
you have to have none

00:38:47.910 --> 00:38:50.490
is not going to work out.

00:38:50.490 --> 00:38:52.450
And, in fact, I've
done research on this

00:38:52.450 --> 00:38:55.250
with my collaborator, Andrew
Ward, years and years and years

00:38:55.250 --> 00:38:56.400
ago.

00:38:56.400 --> 00:38:59.610
We forbade our subjects from
eating a particular food

00:38:59.610 --> 00:39:02.140
for three weeks,
just three weeks.

00:39:02.140 --> 00:39:05.390
And we found that they
thought about that food more

00:39:05.390 --> 00:39:07.810
and desired that food more
than if we hadn't forbade them.

00:39:07.810 --> 00:39:10.930
But here's the crucial thing, we
purposely had them pick a food

00:39:10.930 --> 00:39:12.910
that they felt neutral about.

00:39:12.910 --> 00:39:15.330
Not something they loved,
not something they hated,

00:39:15.330 --> 00:39:19.390
something right there in
the, eh, in that middle area.

00:39:19.390 --> 00:39:21.500
And still, they thought
about it all the time

00:39:21.500 --> 00:39:22.580
and wanted it so much.

00:39:22.580 --> 00:39:24.360
Imagine if you're
restricting yourself

00:39:24.360 --> 00:39:26.068
or you're forbidding
yourself from eating

00:39:26.068 --> 00:39:27.570
something you really love?

00:39:27.570 --> 00:39:30.560
It backfires.

00:39:30.560 --> 00:39:33.590
Actually, Google did a variant
of this strategy-- I actually

00:39:33.590 --> 00:39:34.710
mention this in the book.

00:39:34.710 --> 00:39:36.960
And you guys probably know
about it-- with their M&amp;Ms.

00:39:36.960 --> 00:39:40.570
They used to have M&amp;Ms all over
the place in glass canisters.

00:39:40.570 --> 00:39:43.910
And at some point, they switched
them to opaque canisters,

00:39:43.910 --> 00:39:48.160
just to put one more step
between you and those M&amp;Ms,

00:39:48.160 --> 00:39:51.100
just to remove one
more bit of temptation.

00:39:51.100 --> 00:39:54.803
M&amp;M consumption went way
down after they did that.

00:39:54.803 --> 00:39:56.740
So good work, Google.

00:39:56.740 --> 00:39:57.480
Bravo.

00:39:57.480 --> 00:40:01.269
But they still have M&amp;Ms.
Well, I didn't see any.

00:40:01.269 --> 00:40:02.060
Maybe they're here.

00:40:02.060 --> 00:40:03.460
I had Twizzlers, something lean.

00:40:03.460 --> 00:40:03.670
Yeah.

00:40:03.670 --> 00:40:04.370
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:04.370 --> 00:40:05.130
OK.

00:40:05.130 --> 00:40:08.420
I was happy about that.

00:40:08.420 --> 00:40:09.750
So that's one kind of strategy.

00:40:09.750 --> 00:40:11.710
Now another kind of
strategy just flips

00:40:11.710 --> 00:40:15.110
that one around to help
you eat more healthy food

00:40:15.110 --> 00:40:18.874
by removing obstacles that
come between you and them.

00:40:18.874 --> 00:40:21.040
So removing obstacles between
you and healthy stuff.

00:40:21.040 --> 00:40:25.900
So here's an obstacle to eating
vegetables, a big obstacle.

00:40:25.900 --> 00:40:28.740
For most people,
especially children,

00:40:28.740 --> 00:40:31.510
vegetables lose to other foods.

00:40:31.510 --> 00:40:35.500
Most people don't think of
them as yummy as other foods.

00:40:35.500 --> 00:40:38.230
So they lose when they're put
in head-to-head competition,

00:40:38.230 --> 00:40:43.240
like they are on every
plate ever, anywhere.

00:40:43.240 --> 00:40:45.340
That's a competition
a vegetable will lose.

00:40:45.340 --> 00:40:49.260
Here's a competition a vegetable
can win, some of the time.

00:40:49.260 --> 00:40:49.930
OK, nothing.

00:40:49.930 --> 00:40:55.510
Vegetable versus nothing, they
do sometimes beat nothing.

00:40:55.510 --> 00:40:57.030
And this strategy, we've tested.

00:40:57.030 --> 00:40:59.500
It's what I call get
alone with a vegetable.

00:40:59.500 --> 00:41:01.810
And it's just as easy as this.

00:41:01.810 --> 00:41:05.710
Eat a vegetable before you put
any other food on your plate.

00:41:05.710 --> 00:41:08.020
Or no, no don't do that.

00:41:08.020 --> 00:41:09.660
Ugh.

00:41:09.660 --> 00:41:15.479
Eat a vegetable while there
is no other food in sight.

00:41:15.479 --> 00:41:17.520
If all you have is a
vegetable and you're hungry,

00:41:17.520 --> 00:41:18.606
you'll eat the vegetable.

00:41:18.606 --> 00:41:20.480
But put it on the plate
next to the spaghetti

00:41:20.480 --> 00:41:22.760
and all bets are off.

00:41:22.760 --> 00:41:25.480
I actually got the idea for
this from watching my kids when

00:41:25.480 --> 00:41:27.340
they were age three and six.

00:41:27.340 --> 00:41:29.130
We were in a restaurant,
a deli, which

00:41:29.130 --> 00:41:31.588
would normally come and put a
bowl of pickles on the table.

00:41:31.588 --> 00:41:33.150
You've been to places like this.

00:41:33.150 --> 00:41:36.430
That one day, they were
out of pickles I guess.

00:41:36.430 --> 00:41:38.730
Instead, they brought
a bowl of sauerkraut,

00:41:38.730 --> 00:41:42.580
a large bowl of sauerkraut,
which I think is disgusting.

00:41:42.580 --> 00:41:43.660
And I like most things.

00:41:43.660 --> 00:41:47.984
And apologies, foods are
culturally linked and what-not.

00:41:47.984 --> 00:41:49.650
I don't want to insult
anyone's culture.

00:41:49.650 --> 00:41:52.330
Actually, I have Eastern
European relatives.

00:41:52.330 --> 00:41:53.840
It's my culture too.

00:41:53.840 --> 00:41:56.510
In any case, I think it's
a hard sell for children.

00:41:56.510 --> 00:41:57.630
OK, fair enough?

00:41:57.630 --> 00:42:00.620
No one's hurt or
offended by this.

00:42:00.620 --> 00:42:03.180
My kids, again aged
three and six, gobbled up

00:42:03.180 --> 00:42:07.380
an entire big bowl of
sauerkraut, with their fingers,

00:42:07.380 --> 00:42:11.670
before I could even
turn them against it

00:42:11.670 --> 00:42:15.080
by giving my opinion of it.

00:42:15.080 --> 00:42:17.830
And disgusting too,
use a fork people.

00:42:17.830 --> 00:42:18.930
Jesus.

00:42:18.930 --> 00:42:19.480
God.

00:42:19.480 --> 00:42:21.680
There wasn't a fork.

00:42:21.680 --> 00:42:23.490
In any case, this
works with children.

00:42:23.490 --> 00:42:24.900
We tested it with children.

00:42:24.900 --> 00:42:26.733
My University of Minnesota
colleagues and I,

00:42:26.733 --> 00:42:28.990
we tested this in elementary
school cafeterias.

00:42:28.990 --> 00:42:31.730
We just gave each student a
little cup of baby carrots

00:42:31.730 --> 00:42:33.910
before they went
to the cafeteria

00:42:33.910 --> 00:42:36.880
and went in and got all their
food and sat down with it.

00:42:36.880 --> 00:42:39.370
Normally, in this school
district, only about 10%

00:42:39.370 --> 00:42:43.410
of the kids were eating
vegetables at any given meal.

00:42:43.410 --> 00:42:46.800
But once we used this strategy,
five times as many kids

00:42:46.800 --> 00:42:48.870
ate the carrots.

00:42:48.870 --> 00:42:50.664
This is extremely
effective with children.

00:42:50.664 --> 00:42:52.330
And then I also tested
it with the girls

00:42:52.330 --> 00:42:56.310
in my freshman seminar
at the U of M last fall.

00:42:56.310 --> 00:42:59.470
We had them try this
for three weeks, just

00:42:59.470 --> 00:43:01.220
to eat a vegetable
first before they got

00:43:01.220 --> 00:43:02.710
the rest of their tray of food.

00:43:02.710 --> 00:43:05.930
And they ate more
vegetables in that time.

00:43:05.930 --> 00:43:08.415
But not only that, they
also ate fewer calories

00:43:08.415 --> 00:43:10.790
in that same time period, even
though they weren't trying

00:43:10.790 --> 00:43:11.910
to reduce their calories.

00:43:11.910 --> 00:43:14.230
They were only trying
to eat more vegetables.

00:43:14.230 --> 00:43:14.810
But it helps.

00:43:14.810 --> 00:43:17.379
Because eating vegetables,
if you eat more of them,

00:43:17.379 --> 00:43:19.170
you're going to eat
less of something else,

00:43:19.170 --> 00:43:20.960
generally, maybe not always.

00:43:24.627 --> 00:43:25.710
So there's two strategies.

00:43:25.710 --> 00:43:26.740
There's 12 in the book.

00:43:26.740 --> 00:43:28.270
I'm just giving you two of them.

00:43:28.270 --> 00:43:30.090
So the key to all
of these strategies,

00:43:30.090 --> 00:43:32.990
including the other ones, is
that they don't have anything

00:43:32.990 --> 00:43:34.760
to do with dieting or willpower.

00:43:34.760 --> 00:43:37.280
They will work, no matter how
little willpower you have.

00:43:37.280 --> 00:43:40.640
They'll work for all of us,
with all our crappy willpower.

00:43:40.640 --> 00:43:44.460
And what I recommend, what
I hope people will do,

00:43:44.460 --> 00:43:48.900
what I think is a sensible
solution to the craziness

00:43:48.900 --> 00:43:51.740
of the pressures for
the extreme dieting

00:43:51.740 --> 00:43:55.610
and the also inappropriate,
just do anything you want,

00:43:55.610 --> 00:43:58.410
I think a sensible
middle ground is

00:43:58.410 --> 00:44:01.580
to make these simple changes,
these sorts of strategies.

00:44:01.580 --> 00:44:03.530
And then get on with that.

00:44:03.530 --> 00:44:06.990
And by doing that, you can reach
your leanest livable weight.

00:44:06.990 --> 00:44:09.620
You will be healthy
at that weight.

00:44:09.620 --> 00:44:11.270
You'll feel better
about yourself

00:44:11.270 --> 00:44:12.900
and stop worrying
about your weight.

00:44:12.900 --> 00:44:14.970
Get weight back to
where it belongs,

00:44:14.970 --> 00:44:17.700
which is one of the more
minor things you think about

00:44:17.700 --> 00:44:18.610
or worry about.

00:44:18.610 --> 00:44:22.550
And not this giant thing in
your face, that causes so much

00:44:22.550 --> 00:44:25.070
torture to so many people.

00:44:25.070 --> 00:44:26.850
So what I'm hoping
is that people

00:44:26.850 --> 00:44:30.947
feel liberated by the message in
this book and not discouraged.

00:44:30.947 --> 00:44:33.030
Because even though it
starts with the three worst

00:44:33.030 --> 00:44:37.720
words, apparently, the three bad
news words, diets don't work,

00:44:37.720 --> 00:44:41.860
it does end with those
really most cheerful words

00:44:41.860 --> 00:44:44.510
in the whole English
language, if you ask me,

00:44:44.510 --> 00:44:48.080
which of these three
words, cup or cone.

00:44:48.080 --> 00:44:50.860
You can't get more
cheerful than that.

00:44:50.860 --> 00:44:54.245
And since I'm here at
Google, and I love Google,

00:44:54.245 --> 00:44:55.620
I thought I would
let Google have

00:44:55.620 --> 00:44:57.910
the last word on this topic.

00:44:57.910 --> 00:45:01.530
So I typed in dieting is not.

00:45:01.530 --> 00:45:05.450
And Google came back with
dieting is not working;

00:45:05.450 --> 00:45:10.550
not a piece of cake; not good;
and absolutely, definitely not

00:45:10.550 --> 00:45:11.630
the answer.

00:45:11.630 --> 00:45:13.151
So Google knows all.

00:45:13.151 --> 00:45:13.651
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:13.651 --> 00:45:14.665
So thank you Google.

00:45:14.665 --> 00:45:16.040
And thank you guys
for having me.

00:45:16.040 --> 00:45:18.780
I will answer any kind of
crazy question you want to ask.

00:45:18.780 --> 00:45:22.408
Or a serious one, whatever,
I'm good, anything you want.

00:45:22.408 --> 00:45:25.192
[APPLAUSE]

00:45:25.192 --> 00:45:27.220
What have we got there?

00:45:27.220 --> 00:45:29.150
AUDIENCE: I have a
small technical question

00:45:29.150 --> 00:45:34.612
about how you got the 4 and the
32% variation that explains.

00:45:34.612 --> 00:45:37.070
Is it like a simple linear
model and you used the R-squared

00:45:37.070 --> 00:45:38.735
or something?

00:45:38.735 --> 00:45:42.270
TRACI MANN: So that came
from-- I have the citations

00:45:42.270 --> 00:45:44.020
in the Notes section.

00:45:44.020 --> 00:45:48.210
It came from a study-- I want to
say by Walter Michel and Angela

00:45:48.210 --> 00:45:51.310
Duckworth, where they
looked at this very thing.

00:45:51.310 --> 00:45:53.300
And exactly looked
at the correlations

00:45:53.300 --> 00:45:58.950
between the seconds they
could resist the marshmallow

00:45:58.950 --> 00:46:01.320
and then their SAT
score or their weight.

00:46:01.320 --> 00:46:06.360
And they controlled for various
obvious confounding variables.

00:46:06.360 --> 00:46:08.360
And this was the
remaining correlation.

00:46:08.360 --> 00:46:10.410
And then I just
converted the correlation

00:46:10.410 --> 00:46:13.020
to the percent of variance
because it's like people

00:46:13.020 --> 00:46:14.300
understand that more.

00:46:14.300 --> 00:46:15.620
I don't know, maybe not.

00:46:15.620 --> 00:46:17.649
Maybe people would have
preferred a correlation.

00:46:17.649 --> 00:46:19.190
But, yeah, that's
where it came from.

00:46:19.190 --> 00:46:22.590
So just directly off of
their published studies.

00:46:22.590 --> 00:46:26.440
They don't describe it
that way in their studies.

00:46:26.440 --> 00:46:28.940
AUDIENCE: What's your opinion
on strategies like drink water

00:46:28.940 --> 00:46:31.060
before, if you want
to lose weight; after,

00:46:31.060 --> 00:46:32.516
if you want to gain weight?

00:46:32.516 --> 00:46:34.880
TRACI MANN: Oh, I haven't
heard the drink water after,

00:46:34.880 --> 00:46:36.780
if you want to gain weight.

00:46:36.780 --> 00:46:37.480
Wow.

00:46:37.480 --> 00:46:39.560
How does that-- I don't know.

00:46:39.560 --> 00:46:41.694
I don't know how that works.

00:46:41.694 --> 00:46:42.688
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:46:42.688 --> 00:46:44.180
TRACI MANN: Ah.

00:46:44.180 --> 00:46:47.980
I mean if you fill yourself up
before a meal with some water

00:46:47.980 --> 00:46:49.950
and that helps you to
eat less, if you're

00:46:49.950 --> 00:46:54.080
prone to eating too much
of something unhealthy,

00:46:54.080 --> 00:46:57.176
I don't think having a little
water is going to hurt you.

00:46:57.176 --> 00:46:59.230
I'm OK with that.

00:46:59.230 --> 00:47:00.680
Yeah.

00:47:00.680 --> 00:47:03.050
It seems-- I'm on-board.

00:47:03.050 --> 00:47:03.610
Yeah.

00:47:03.610 --> 00:47:05.320
I just don't want
people to focus so much

00:47:05.320 --> 00:47:07.770
on the number on the scale.

00:47:07.770 --> 00:47:08.550
Yeah.

00:47:08.550 --> 00:47:10.509
But that seems like a
reasonable healthy to do.

00:47:10.509 --> 00:47:12.341
AUDIENCE: So what's a
good way to figure out

00:47:12.341 --> 00:47:14.250
your range, like your
healthy weight range?

00:47:14.250 --> 00:47:17.205
Is it just when you start to
plateau using healthy weight

00:47:17.205 --> 00:47:18.345
loss methods or what?

00:47:18.345 --> 00:47:19.220
TRACI MANN: Oh, yeah.

00:47:19.220 --> 00:47:20.000
That's a good way to look at.

00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:21.916
OK, so that's the-- I
get this question a lot.

00:47:21.916 --> 00:47:25.230
And it's, I think, the
hardest question to answer

00:47:25.230 --> 00:47:28.550
scientifically because
there's not research on this

00:47:28.550 --> 00:47:31.050
that I've seen about
how to nail in on this.

00:47:31.050 --> 00:47:35.340
So what it seems to me,
what I sort of concluded

00:47:35.340 --> 00:47:37.706
by talking to lots
of people about this,

00:47:37.706 --> 00:47:41.459
is the middle of your
sort of set range

00:47:41.459 --> 00:47:43.000
is going to be the
weight, it's going

00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:47.530
to be the thing you weigh
when you've eaten reasonably,

00:47:47.530 --> 00:47:50.290
without dieting, but
without binge eating.

00:47:50.290 --> 00:47:54.360
So you've eaten, like, a really
kind of basic amount of food.

00:47:54.360 --> 00:47:57.460
And you've not been
totally sedentary.

00:47:57.460 --> 00:47:59.570
But you haven't, like,
just won a race either.

00:47:59.570 --> 00:48:00.570
So you know what I mean?

00:48:00.570 --> 00:48:03.920
So you're really in the
middle of all these behaviors

00:48:03.920 --> 00:48:06.120
that we know we're
supposed to do.

00:48:06.120 --> 00:48:09.370
And that's going to kind of
be the middle of your range.

00:48:09.370 --> 00:48:11.100
And another way
people notice this

00:48:11.100 --> 00:48:14.110
is it's the weight that you
keep seeming to come back to.

00:48:14.110 --> 00:48:15.832
You just keep going back there.

00:48:15.832 --> 00:48:18.040
So whatever you do, suddenly
you're back there again.

00:48:18.040 --> 00:48:18.840
Oh, really?

00:48:18.840 --> 00:48:19.620
Am I here again?

00:48:19.620 --> 00:48:21.730
And then you can use
these healthy strategies

00:48:21.730 --> 00:48:24.920
to go 10 pounds
less or whatever,

00:48:24.920 --> 00:48:27.420
depending on how much you
weighed to begin with.

00:48:27.420 --> 00:48:27.920
Yeah.

00:48:27.920 --> 00:48:28.420
Exactly.

00:48:28.420 --> 00:48:34.230
But I can't point at like a
scientific, like, calculation

00:48:34.230 --> 00:48:36.510
that you can use to get there.

00:48:36.510 --> 00:48:37.820
That would be cool, though.

00:48:37.820 --> 00:48:39.959
But, yeah, that doesn't exist.

00:48:39.959 --> 00:48:41.250
AUDIENCE: So thanks for coming.

00:48:41.250 --> 00:48:45.310
But just to be clear,
my lack of willpower

00:48:45.310 --> 00:48:48.166
is not the primary reason
why my weight fluctuates

00:48:48.166 --> 00:48:50.040
is what you're saying
or my current weight is

00:48:50.040 --> 00:48:50.735
the way it is?

00:48:50.735 --> 00:48:53.460
Is that like-- just so
I can tell my wife that.

00:48:53.460 --> 00:48:55.940
TRACI MANN: It's not-- Right.

00:48:55.940 --> 00:48:56.889
Definitely.

00:48:56.889 --> 00:48:57.430
AUDIENCE: No.

00:48:57.430 --> 00:48:59.510
In all seriousness,
like I remember

00:48:59.510 --> 00:49:01.750
high school I was--
for all of high school,

00:49:01.750 --> 00:49:03.040
I was probably like 160.

00:49:03.040 --> 00:49:05.430
And then university hit,
like that the freshman 15,

00:49:05.430 --> 00:49:07.542
I just went to, like, 180--

00:49:07.542 --> 00:49:08.250
TRACI MANN: Yeah.

00:49:08.250 --> 00:49:08.720
You're giant.

00:49:08.720 --> 00:49:09.230
AUDIENCE: --and stayed there.

00:49:09.230 --> 00:49:09.730
Yeah.

00:49:09.730 --> 00:49:10.570
I'm a giant, I know.

00:49:10.570 --> 00:49:11.020
TRACI MANN: That's a huge
human who's talking now.

00:49:11.020 --> 00:49:12.530
AUDIENCE: But I stayed
there for the longest time,

00:49:12.530 --> 00:49:14.321
even though I tried to
do all these things.

00:49:14.321 --> 00:49:16.740
So how does your
theory explain-- is it

00:49:16.740 --> 00:49:18.500
just my hormones
changed in university.

00:49:18.500 --> 00:49:22.230
Therefore, like, I'm now
stuck at this new plateau,

00:49:22.230 --> 00:49:23.420
kind of thing?

00:49:23.420 --> 00:49:24.836
TRACI MANN: So,
yeah, the research

00:49:24.836 --> 00:49:28.210
has showed that--
you see lots of diets

00:49:28.210 --> 00:49:31.170
out there that say they're the
change your set point diet.

00:49:31.170 --> 00:49:32.415
I've seen this exact thing.

00:49:32.415 --> 00:49:34.040
There's absolutely
no evidence that you

00:49:34.040 --> 00:49:35.720
can lower your set point.

00:49:35.720 --> 00:49:38.210
But, unfortunately,
there is some evidence

00:49:38.210 --> 00:49:42.620
that it can creep upward,
does this slowly over time,

00:49:42.620 --> 00:49:47.860
with large life changes,
such as going off to college,

00:49:47.860 --> 00:49:50.820
when you change your
eating habits in a big way.

00:49:50.820 --> 00:49:52.900
Lots of people, when
they get married,

00:49:52.900 --> 00:49:55.130
have very big changes
in their eating habits.

00:49:55.130 --> 00:49:58.570
And you see it creeping upward.

00:49:58.570 --> 00:50:01.180
Women, during
menopause, same thing.

00:50:01.180 --> 00:50:03.040
You see this creep upward.

00:50:03.040 --> 00:50:04.050
So it can creep.

00:50:04.050 --> 00:50:06.300
AUDIENCE: And then, just to
follow up on her question,

00:50:06.300 --> 00:50:09.890
how long should you do this,
trying of figure out your set

00:50:09.890 --> 00:50:12.490
point or set range?

00:50:12.490 --> 00:50:14.550
Like how long you have
to eat healthy and not

00:50:14.550 --> 00:50:15.320
binge eat, and--

00:50:15.320 --> 00:50:16.736
TRACI MANN: A
healthy, healthyish.

00:50:16.736 --> 00:50:18.819
AUDIENCE: --diet?

00:50:18.819 --> 00:50:19.860
TRACI MANN: I don't know.

00:50:19.860 --> 00:50:23.380
Again, there's not a
clear science to that.

00:50:23.380 --> 00:50:28.025
So I'm going to pull a number
out of the sky for you.

00:50:28.025 --> 00:50:28.900
Would you like me to?

00:50:28.900 --> 00:50:30.040
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:50:30.040 --> 00:50:32.480
TRACI MANN: Let's say,
how about a month?

00:50:32.480 --> 00:50:34.150
How about a month?

00:50:34.150 --> 00:50:35.455
That sounds about right, right?

00:50:35.455 --> 00:50:38.120
If you do-- yeah,
maybe a couple weeks,

00:50:38.120 --> 00:50:40.790
three weeks,
something like that.

00:50:40.790 --> 00:50:42.507
Definitely not a
huge amount of time.

00:50:42.507 --> 00:50:43.340
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:50:43.340 --> 00:50:44.120
TRACI MANN: Please?

00:50:44.120 --> 00:50:45.510
AUDIENCE: Did you
look at the psychology

00:50:45.510 --> 00:50:48.040
of stress and how some people
eat when they're stressed--

00:50:48.040 --> 00:50:48.370
TRACI MANN: Yes.

00:50:48.370 --> 00:50:49.340
AUDIENCE: --and
some people can't

00:50:49.340 --> 00:50:50.423
eat when they're stressed?

00:50:50.423 --> 00:50:51.720
TRACI MANN: It's true.

00:50:51.720 --> 00:50:57.110
So emotional eating is a big
issue in the dieting world.

00:50:57.110 --> 00:50:59.720
So there's a couple of
different things about stress.

00:50:59.720 --> 00:51:03.520
One is that I've done research
with my former student, Janet

00:51:03.520 --> 00:51:07.040
Tomiyama, where we found
that dieting itself

00:51:07.040 --> 00:51:09.697
causes a physiological
stress response in your body.

00:51:09.697 --> 00:51:11.530
This could be another
reason why diets don't

00:51:11.530 --> 00:51:13.092
lead to long-term weight loss.

00:51:13.092 --> 00:51:17.380
So stress is clearly a problem.

00:51:17.380 --> 00:51:20.190
What it looks like
is that the people

00:51:20.190 --> 00:51:22.750
who eat in response
to stress tend

00:51:22.750 --> 00:51:27.640
to be dieters, people
trying to not eat.

00:51:27.640 --> 00:51:29.550
People trying not to
overeat are the ones who

00:51:29.550 --> 00:51:31.020
eat in response to the stress.

00:51:31.020 --> 00:51:34.170
Whereas people who aren't
worrying about their eating

00:51:34.170 --> 00:51:36.850
are the ones who eat less
when they're stressed.

00:51:36.850 --> 00:51:43.570
So what it looks like to us is
that stress messes up diets.

00:51:43.570 --> 00:51:47.060
Dieters are more likely to
overeat in response to stress.

00:51:47.060 --> 00:51:48.910
And stress messes things up.

00:51:48.910 --> 00:51:54.910
So removing stress is a good,
important strategy for-- well,

00:51:54.910 --> 00:51:55.840
for overall health.

00:51:55.840 --> 00:51:58.230
I mean stress is
extremely bad for you

00:51:58.230 --> 00:52:00.140
regardless of whether
or not you're dieting.

00:52:00.140 --> 00:52:02.640
So removing stress
is an important part

00:52:02.640 --> 00:52:04.530
of being a healthy person.

00:52:04.530 --> 00:52:08.030
And it will also help
you not gain weight.

00:52:08.030 --> 00:52:12.690
I'll say one more thing about
emotional eating, if I may,

00:52:12.690 --> 00:52:15.360
which is about
eating comfort food.

00:52:15.360 --> 00:52:18.930
This is the strangest thing
we ever found in our research.

00:52:18.930 --> 00:52:22.240
Is that eating comfort food
doesn't do anything special

00:52:22.240 --> 00:52:23.740
for your mood.

00:52:23.740 --> 00:52:25.830
It doesn't do anything
different for your mood

00:52:25.830 --> 00:52:28.000
than eating any other food.

00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:30.130
And it doesn't do anything
different for your mood

00:52:30.130 --> 00:52:32.410
than not eating food.

00:52:32.410 --> 00:52:35.270
We tested it in all these
different comparisons

00:52:35.270 --> 00:52:36.850
and it didn't matter.

00:52:36.850 --> 00:52:40.470
Everything, even time,
made your mood slowly

00:52:40.470 --> 00:52:44.580
creep upward after we-- first,
we messed up people's moods.

00:52:44.580 --> 00:52:45.933
And then we looked at what--

00:52:45.933 --> 00:52:46.591
[LAUGHTER]

00:52:46.591 --> 00:52:47.840
This is how you have to do it.

00:52:47.840 --> 00:52:50.720
And then we looked at what
happened when we gave them

00:52:50.720 --> 00:52:52.150
either their own
personal comfort

00:52:52.150 --> 00:52:54.840
food, or a neutral
food, or a food

00:52:54.840 --> 00:52:57.120
that they like just as
much as their comfort food,

00:52:57.120 --> 00:52:58.160
or no food at all.

00:52:58.160 --> 00:53:00.820
And in every case,
their mood improved.

00:53:00.820 --> 00:53:03.250
But the comfort food didn't
make it improve more.

00:53:03.250 --> 00:53:05.790
So because of this
I've come to believe

00:53:05.790 --> 00:53:08.450
that comfort food is
the thing that you

00:53:08.450 --> 00:53:10.510
crave when you're feeling bad.

00:53:10.510 --> 00:53:13.320
It's the thing you want
when you're feeling bad.

00:53:13.320 --> 00:53:16.410
But it doesn't actually do
anything special for you.

00:53:16.410 --> 00:53:19.090
And maybe you think it does
because when you eat it,

00:53:19.090 --> 00:53:20.069
you feel better.

00:53:20.069 --> 00:53:22.360
But you don't realize, you
don't have the control group

00:53:22.360 --> 00:53:24.450
in your head, which is
if you hadn't eaten it,

00:53:24.450 --> 00:53:26.866
you'd have felt better too or
if you eaten something else,

00:53:26.866 --> 00:53:28.340
you'd have felt better too.

00:53:28.340 --> 00:53:32.570
So we encourage people to not
reach for their comfort food

00:53:32.570 --> 00:53:34.392
when they're feeling
bad, thinking

00:53:34.392 --> 00:53:35.850
that it's going to
make them better

00:53:35.850 --> 00:53:37.370
in some special, extra way.

00:53:37.370 --> 00:53:39.360
It's not.

00:53:39.360 --> 00:53:40.980
I would say save
the comfort food,

00:53:40.980 --> 00:53:42.980
save that particular food,
for when you're happy

00:53:42.980 --> 00:53:45.620
and can really enjoy
and appreciate it.

00:53:45.620 --> 00:53:50.630
But you don't really need an
excuse to eat those foods.

00:53:50.630 --> 00:53:52.430
You can eat them when you wish.

00:53:52.430 --> 00:53:53.890
Just don't justify
them, thinking

00:53:53.890 --> 00:53:56.785
it's going to make you feel
better because no, it's not.

00:53:56.785 --> 00:53:58.660
I mean it's not going
to make you feel worse.

00:53:58.660 --> 00:53:59.950
Don't go there.

00:53:59.950 --> 00:54:01.969
It's not going to do that.

00:54:01.969 --> 00:54:02.510
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:54:02.510 --> 00:54:04.840
So I thought the twin
study-- not the twin study,

00:54:04.840 --> 00:54:07.084
the adopted child study
is really interesting,

00:54:07.084 --> 00:54:08.500
how they found
that they were more

00:54:08.500 --> 00:54:10.680
like their biological
parents than the environment

00:54:10.680 --> 00:54:12.060
that they are brought up in.

00:54:12.060 --> 00:54:13.490
And I was wondering,
like, when they compared

00:54:13.490 --> 00:54:14.980
to the biological
parents is they

00:54:14.980 --> 00:54:18.669
compared, like, with those
parents at that kid's age?

00:54:18.669 --> 00:54:20.960
Because, like, obviously
parents are normal people too.

00:54:20.960 --> 00:54:24.060
They change-- like their
set point changes over time.

00:54:24.060 --> 00:54:26.030
If, like, that
makes a difference?

00:54:26.030 --> 00:54:27.950
Because I do know
like some people--

00:54:27.950 --> 00:54:30.460
things like bone structure,
metabolism, like that,

00:54:30.460 --> 00:54:32.740
that's all influenced by
your parents and stuff.

00:54:32.740 --> 00:54:35.170
But if it was like the
parent at that child's age

00:54:35.170 --> 00:54:36.820
or the parent at
the current age?

00:54:36.820 --> 00:54:37.736
TRACI MANN: It's true.

00:54:37.736 --> 00:54:40.690
So those are studies done--
I want to say Sweden,

00:54:40.690 --> 00:54:43.050
but I could be wrong--
Scandinavian-type countries,

00:54:43.050 --> 00:54:46.700
that keep these amazing,
immaculate birth records.

00:54:46.700 --> 00:54:49.380
And what their studies
were able to find

00:54:49.380 --> 00:54:53.820
was that parents'
weight-- when what is it,

00:54:53.820 --> 00:54:55.249
when the child is born?

00:54:55.249 --> 00:54:56.790
And then they also
went back and were

00:54:56.790 --> 00:54:59.900
able to track these
people down because

00:54:59.900 --> 00:55:02.420
of these amazing records, and
then get their current weight.

00:55:02.420 --> 00:55:04.770
So it was their
full-grown adult weight

00:55:04.770 --> 00:55:06.926
for both sets of parents.

00:55:06.926 --> 00:55:08.000
Yeah.

00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:09.270
It's crazy.

00:55:09.270 --> 00:55:10.949
It's so cool that
they can do that.

00:55:10.949 --> 00:55:11.740
FEMALE SPEAKER: OK.

00:55:11.740 --> 00:55:13.114
If there's no more
questions, I'd

00:55:13.114 --> 00:55:14.985
like to thank Dr.
Mann again for coming.

00:55:14.985 --> 00:55:15.290
TRACI MANN: Thank you.

00:55:15.290 --> 00:55:17.581
FEMALE SPEAKER: Thank you so
much for being here today.

00:55:17.581 --> 00:55:18.560
TRACI MANN: Thank you.

00:55:18.560 --> 00:55:20.880
[APPLAUSE]
