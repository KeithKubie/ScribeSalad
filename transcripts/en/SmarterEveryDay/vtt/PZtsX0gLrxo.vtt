00:00:00.017 --> 00:00:03.060
- You wanna see it kicking
back in normal conditions

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:05.950
and you wanna test it in
not-so-normal conditions

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:08.660
until that's not kickback,
you wanna give it all

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:11.493
of the edge cases so it
know what's going on.

00:00:11.493 --> 00:00:14.190
- [Destin] Why are you
smiling, why are you smiling?

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:15.023
(laughing)

00:00:15.023 --> 00:00:16.690
- I think we should test the edge cases.

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.717
- I normally say, "Hey, it's me Destin,

00:00:19.717 --> 00:00:21.430
"welcome back to Smarter Every Day,"

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:23.120
but there's nothin' smart about this.

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:28.120
So here's the deal, this is a rocket saw

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:30.810
and I wanna say I'm sorry
but I'm totally not.

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.380
Here's the deal, here's how we got here.

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:34.670
So in the last video, we explained

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:36.640
how we had incorporated machine learning

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.250
into power tools in order to keep them

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.440
from hurting you, right?

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.810
So the way you work with a
machine learning algorithm

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:44.950
is you get a really big fancy computer

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:46.730
and you start to sort events out

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:48.380
like data collection events.

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:50.160
In our case, normal use of a saw

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.380
so we see like a normal thing
that happens with a saw,

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:55.260
we put it in the normal bucket, right?

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.440
But as we see these
things that are dangerous,

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.230
we would put those over
here in the dangerous pile

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:02.790
and if you do this enough,
eventually the computer

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:06.100
can sort between dangerous
events and normal events.

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:08.920
You can't test everything in the world,

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.080
okay so you come up with all
these really weird things

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:13.110
and you do your best to like sort 'em out

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.600
but eventually you get to the edge cases

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:16.920
and you have to make a decision

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.380
like as a human, where do these things go?

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.930
One of those things we thought
about was a rocket saw.

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:24.420
Obviously the rocket saw's gonna go

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.470
in the danger pile and
we're not actually gonna

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:28.960
collect data on this shot but we thought

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:31.410
about a rocket saw and once you realize

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:34.110
you're smart enough to make a rocket saw--

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.390
So we got a rocket powered saw

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:39.570
and we're gonna see what happens.

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.723
I think it's just gonna stop back there.

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.420
I don't think it's gonna
make it this far, do you?

00:01:47.861 --> 00:01:49.990
- [Man] Yeah, no bets buddy.

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:51.780
- [Destin] Four rockets,
we got two Fs and two Ds.

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.531
- If only we had five.

00:01:53.531 --> 00:01:55.869
- [Destin] If only we had fire.

00:01:55.869 --> 00:01:57.749
And you've got it all wired
up, ready to go, right?

00:01:57.749 --> 00:01:58.582
- [Man] Yeah.

00:01:58.582 --> 00:01:59.760
- [Destin] This GoPro
lookin' back at the blade

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:01.700
is gonna be nice.

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.560
Like the GoPro should see
the engagement of the teeth

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:07.603
and stuff, this is so dumb, I love it.

00:02:12.303 --> 00:02:14.170
(saw running)

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:15.015
I think it makes--

00:02:15.015 --> 00:02:17.630
(laughing)

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:19.900
Alright, you're tall, you
gotta turn that beast on.

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.840
So it's ready to fire, right?

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.270
You've got the thing wired up, right?

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:24.320
- Right.
- Okay.

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:25.480
This is one of the more noble things

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:26.780
I've ever done in my life.

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:30.410
Now would be an excellent time

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:31.570
to make a prediction on what you think

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:32.840
this thing is gonna do to the wood.

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.230
Also, the very first video I ever uploaded

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:36.617
to this channel, called, "How to Light

00:02:36.617 --> 00:02:39.110
"a Bonfire with Rockets," cringe-worthy.

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:40.940
It's like the first video ever made.

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:42.770
It also involves shooting a rocket

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:44.781
from this exact same tree.

00:02:44.781 --> 00:02:46.501
(beeping)

00:02:46.501 --> 00:02:48.332
(saw running)

00:02:48.332 --> 00:02:49.550
Alright, lemme go arm
the high-speed camera.

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:50.776
- [Man] Oh my god.

00:02:50.776 --> 00:02:53.026
(laughing)

00:02:55.913 --> 00:02:58.413
(saw running)

00:03:02.812 --> 00:03:05.462
Three, two, holy crap, one.

00:03:05.462 --> 00:03:08.295
(rocket whizzing)

00:03:11.673 --> 00:03:12.506
One!

00:03:12.506 --> 00:03:14.033
(rocket whizzing)

00:03:14.033 --> 00:03:16.283
(laughing)

00:03:19.593 --> 00:03:20.760
What happened?

00:03:23.981 --> 00:03:25.581
Holy crap.

00:03:25.581 --> 00:03:28.130
- [Destin] Get the GoPro
before it catches on fire.

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:29.590
- [Man] If it's still there.

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:30.460
- [Destin] Oh, it's still there.

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:32.110
- [Man] Is it still there?
- Oh!

00:03:33.061 --> 00:03:34.240
(laughing)

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:35.820
Totally survived.

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:36.890
- [Man] It bounced up.
- [Destin] Yeah I don't even

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:39.390
think, like it didn't even try.

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:41.982
It didn't even try.
- [Man] It just rolled on it.

00:03:41.982 --> 00:03:44.701
- [Man 2] We got it man.
- [Destin] Did we, dude?

00:03:44.701 --> 00:03:46.771
We totally did, oh!

00:03:46.771 --> 00:03:49.021
(laughing)

00:04:05.969 --> 00:04:09.802
(slow motion rocket whizzing)

00:04:20.717 --> 00:04:23.367
That's a thing you can do with friends.

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:26.700
- [Man] On a Friday night.
- Who needs drugs when

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:28.550
you can do stuff like this, right?

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:30.440
Let's zoom in closer
and see if the saw blade

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:32.329
does what you thought it would do.

00:04:32.329 --> 00:04:34.579
(laughing)

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:49.180
Oh my goodness, my heart.

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:51.280
Oh it just dinged the screen?

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:53.338
Who cares, did you see
what we just did with that?

00:04:53.338 --> 00:04:55.030
(laughing)

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:56.480
This episode of Smarter Every Day

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:59.720
is sponsored by Casper Mattress
and Prince Rupert and I

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:02.873
are going to unbox a
Casper Mattress for you.

00:05:03.858 --> 00:05:05.658
No, come here.

00:05:05.658 --> 00:05:08.610
(meowing)

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:10.560
This mattress is called The Wave.

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:12.760
The Wave is designed
specifically for the needs

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:14.610
of side sleepers like my wife and I.

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:16.320
The whole deal here is that it has

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:18.540
a perforated breathable memory foam

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:21.000
to keep your spine
aligned during the night

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
and keep you cool because it's breathable.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.780
As you press on something,
the amount of squish

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:27.330
is a function of the
elasticity of the material.

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:28.900
The fancy thing they've done with The Wave

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:30.520
is they've varied the elasticity

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:32.430
from the head to the foot of the bed

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:35.110
so you get more elasticity
around the shoulder areas

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:37.170
cause most people's shoulders
are wider than their hips

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:39.700
so it aligns your spine as you sleep

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:41.720
on your side which is a big stinkin' deal

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:43.430
because my wife is a side sleeper.

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:45.662
First two nights with Casper
Wave, what do you think?

00:05:45.662 --> 00:05:47.240
- I like it, I like it.

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:48.400
Am I supposed to look at the camera

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:49.726
or am I supposed to look at you?

00:05:49.726 --> 00:05:50.680
- [Destin] Does it matter?

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:52.260
You wanted a side sleepin' mattress,

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:53.300
does it do what you need?

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:55.300
- I did want one, it does
what I need, absolutely.

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:56.910
- All Wave purchases come with a free

00:05:56.910 --> 00:05:58.830
in-home set-up and a hundred night trial.

00:05:58.830 --> 00:05:59.980
If you don't like it, let 'em know,

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:01.580
they'll come get it, no questions asked.

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:03.210
Their pillows are also awesome by the way,

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:05.120
we've got the soft layer on the outside

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:06.970
and a firm layer on the inside

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:09.000
so each side of the pillow feels like

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.360
the cool side of the pillow.

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:11.880
They didn't ask me to
talk about the pillows,

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:13.529
I asked them if I could
talk about their pillows.

00:06:13.529 --> 00:06:15.960
You can get 50 dollars off a core mattress

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:17.730
or a hundred dollars off The Wave mattress

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:19.100
which is ideal for side sleeping

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:21.410
if you go to Casper.com/smarter

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:23.200
use the promo code smarter at checkout,

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:24.260
you're gonna get a better night's sleep,

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.963
they have engineers workin' on this stuff.

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:35.700
You're still here which
means you understand.

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:37.390
We're both winnin' here, my whole life

00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:39.160
led up to this moment
to make the rocket saw.

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:41.580
Your whole life led up
to watching this video,

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:42.693
we're all winners.

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:45.200
Thanks.

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:46.640
There was a smart reason that

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:48.520
we got to that point, I promise.

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:50.510
- I think we yelled, "For
science!" several times.

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:52.803
- Yeah, that's how that works.

00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:56.620
Alright, well, you're
getting smarter every day.

00:06:56.620 --> 00:06:58.470
Have a good one, thanks for watchin'.
