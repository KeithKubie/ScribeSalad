00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
The answer is we want to do the third thing.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
We want to show some way that if we had the totient of n

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
we could also factor n.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
That would show that finding the totient is not easier than finding the factors.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Of the other choices, the first one is actually not true.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
If we have p and q, it's actually easy to compute the totient of n,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
and it's easy because we know the totient of n is (p - 1)(q - 1).

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:30.000
The second answer is not true, but if it were, it wouldn't help us prove that RSA is hard.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
It would just show that there might be an easier way to compute the totient of n

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
than there is to factor.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
This would be damaging for our security proof.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Fortunately, at least for the security of RSA, the third one is true,

00:00:43.000 --> 99:59:59.000
and next we'll show why.
