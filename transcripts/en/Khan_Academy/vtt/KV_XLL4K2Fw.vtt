00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:04.630
The following line passes
through the point 5 comma 8,

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:11.140
and the equation of the line
is y is equal to 17/13x plus b.

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:14.110
What is the value of
the y-intercept b?

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:17.570
So we know that this
point, this x and y value

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:19.760
must satisfy this
equation, so we

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:24.750
know that when x is equal
to 5, y is equal to 8.

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:31.850
So we can say-- so when x is
equal to 5, y is equal to 8.

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:43.040
So we can say 8 must be equal
to 17/13 times x times 5 plus b,

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.520
and then we can solve for b.

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:48.140
So if we simplify
this a little bit,

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:53.850
we get 8 is equal to--
let's see, 5 times 17 is 50,

00:00:53.850 --> 00:01:00.230
plus 35 is 85-- is 85/13 plus b.

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:04.849
Then to solve for b, we just
subtract 85/13 from both sides.

00:01:04.849 --> 00:01:11.240
So we have 8 minus 85/13.

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:16.080
85/13 Is equal to b.

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.750
And now we just have to
subtract these two numbers.

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:21.350
So 8 is the same
thing as-- let's see.

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:29.650
80 plus 24 is 104,
so it is 104/13--

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:35.830
this is the same thing
as 8-- minus 85/13,

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:37.620
which is going to
be-- let's see.

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:39.777
This is 19/13.

00:01:39.777 --> 00:01:40.360
Is that right?

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:42.930
Yes, if this was 105,
then it would be 20/13.

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:48.810
So this is 19/13, so it's equal
to 19/13, which is equal to b.

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.190
So the equation of this
line is going to be y

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:57.636
is equal to 17/13x plus 19/13.
