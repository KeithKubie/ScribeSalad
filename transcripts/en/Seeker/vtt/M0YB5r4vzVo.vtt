00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:25.900
Going to space was always a risk,

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:27.960
but in the beginning of the Apollo Program, the United

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:33.160
States got a stark realization of just how
dangerous its moon missions would be.

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:50.060
The Apollo Program almost ended before it
even got off the ground.

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:55.540
In the mid 1960s, NASA was working at breakneck
speed, attempting to take another step towards

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:59.839
President John F. Kennedy’s goal to land
a man on the moon by the end of the decade.

00:00:59.839 --> 00:01:04.480
Apollo Program engineers were still focused
on fulfilling the foundation for the project’s

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:08.990
objectives: Establishing the technology to
meet other national interests in space; Achieving

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:14.009
preeminence in space for the U.S.; Carrying
out a program of scientific exploration of

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:19.180
the Moon; And developing man's capability
to work in the lunar environment.

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:27.320
By 1966, NASA upgraded its first multistage
rocket, the Saturn I, to the more powerful Saturn IB.

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:31.720
The top part of the rocket was where several
major systems lived including the Apollo spacecraft

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:34.270
- known as the Command-Service Module or CSM.

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:38.549
The command module was considered the mother
ship, with the goal of carrying the astronauts

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.670
to space and then returning them safely to Earth.

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.969
Inside were three compartments, including
the sealed crew cabin, which only had about

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:47.990
six cubic meters of space.

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:52.859
With all the operational displays, crew couches
and equipment, there was very little room

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:55.009
left over for the astronauts to maneuver.

00:01:55.009 --> 00:02:00.599
A prototype version of the spacecraft, the
Apollo Block I CSM, would be the first to

00:02:00.599 --> 00:02:03.469
embark on a manned mission.

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:07.760
NASA set the launch date for February 21,
1967.

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:13.220
The purpose of the flight was to test launch
operations, ground tracking and control facilities,

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:18.510
and the performance of the Saturn IB rocket
and the CSM spacecraft.

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.569
NASA selected two veterans and one rookie
as the crew for the mission that was later

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:24.599
dubbed Apollo 1.

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:29.150
The command pilot, Gus Grissom, was no stranger
to the stress of space flight.

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:33.810
Grissom was one of the original Mercury pilots,
and during the splashdown of his first mission,

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:38.970
the capsule’s hatch blew open, causing him
to nearly drown.

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:43.209
The senior pilot was Ed White who was the
first American to conduct a space walk during

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:47.739
Project Gemini.

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:50.860
And the pilot was Roger Chaffee who at 31
would be the

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:53.760
youngest American ever to go to space.

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.500
He was added the crew as a replacement after
the original pilot

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:59.100
dislocated his shoulder during training.

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:03.750
Chaffee was known as a notoriously nice guy
who was often teased by other astronauts for

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.280
his admiration of Grissom and White.

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:13.190
He saw the Apollo 1 mission as a way to prove
himself worthy of the title of astronaut.

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:18.090
Early on in their training, Grissom and the
rest of the crew voiced concerns with the

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:22.500
spacecraft - primarily with the amount of
flammable material in the cabin.

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:26.920
The astronauts jokingly presented this crew
portrait to the Apollo Spacecraft Program

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:32.140
Office manager after he gave the spacecraft
a passing grade.

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:36.000
But the thing is, the astronauts weren’t
alone in their concerns.

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:41.359
In fact, some experts believed the immense
pressure of Kennedy’s deadline forced NASA

00:03:41.359 --> 00:03:47.440
and the contractor, North American Aviation,
to make decisions that sacrificed safety.

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:52.159
One of the main concerns was NASA’s decision
to opt for a single gas environment inside

00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:57.189
the capsule over a dual gas environment because
it required a lighter system.

00:03:57.189 --> 00:04:02.550
This meant that the Apollo spacecraft would
use 100% oxygen in the crew cabin, so even

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:06.599
a small spark could quickly turn into a blaze.

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:11.319
Adding to that fear, other astronauts reported
seeing what appeared to be frayed wires and

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:14.129
short circuits in the cabin of the spacecraft.

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:18.470
There were also issues with the decision to
have the hatch open inward and the fact that

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:22.049
it did not carry explosive bolts in case of
an emergency.

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:25.970
NASA and North American Aviation made as many
adjustments as possible.

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:32.170
But in the interest of time, they decided
to move forward with the February flight.

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:38.680
One month before launch, the rocket and spacecraft
were cleared for what was referred to as a “plugs out test”.

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:44.820
At 1pm on January 27th, the Apollo 1 astronauts
entered the command module, sealed the hatch

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:50.220
and prepared for what was considered a sort
of dress rehearsal for the actual flight.

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:55.860
There were problems from the start.

00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:02.490
First, there was a foul odor emanating from
the oxygen tank;

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:07.040
and then there was an alarm triggered, indicating
a high oxygen flow;

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:16.360
To the frustration of the crew, static continually
drowned communication with the control room.

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:23.500
At 6:31pm the test conductors were ready to
start the countdown... seconds later horror struck.

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:32.420
A flash fire ripped through the spacecraft.

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:36.720
The emergency escape procedure called for
a minimum of 90 seconds, but it only took

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:41.960
about 30 seconds for flames and toxic smoke
to engulf the crew cabin.

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:47.370
Despite heroic efforts by NASA ground crews
and controllers, it took a full five minutes

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:50.480
to open the hatch.

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:06.860
The deaths of Grissom, White and Chaffee were
a shocking wake up call that caused many to

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:10.820
question President Kennedy’s deadline to
put a man on the moon.

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:14.840
All the progress NASA had made was blinded
by tragedy.

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:21.150
The investigation of the Apollo 1 fire forced
a hold on the space program.

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:25.720
The hard lessons learned from this mission
would dictate new stringent checks and balances

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:35.760
that would inform all NASA missions to follow,
ultimately changing the nation’s path to the moon.

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:39.720
There’s a lot of history that led up to
this point, so if you want to learn more about
