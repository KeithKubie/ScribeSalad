00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
And now we have our final exam question or rather our final, final exam question.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
This one is about something called morphogenesis.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
This relates to how an organism knows where to grow its legs

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
or where to form colored stripes on its coat and things like that.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
This really concerns pattern formation then.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
And Alan Turing of all people--what a brilliant man--had an idea that an initially only

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
slightly random distribution of chemicals can evolve into a stable pattern over time.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
So we're going to look at one model of how that could happen.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Let's say that we have two different chemicals.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
We have one that we're going to call the activator and one that we're going to call the inhibitor.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Now the activator causes production of both itself and of the inhibitor

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
and also diffuses slowly through the space that we're considering.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
The inhibitor on the other hand causes a reduction of both the activator and itself,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
and it diffuses very quickly through the space.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
So we can look at our graph over here. The x axis is just the space in general.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
And the y axis is concentration of either chemical.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Now, if we consider what's happening in the curves inside this blue circle,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
we can see that where there's a little bit more activator than inhibitor

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
the activator level rises due to diffusion.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000
The inhibitor that is also produced then flows quickly away because this is fast diffusion,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
and it stops other peaks from developing nearby.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
We have equations for how the concentration of the activator and inhibitor change with time.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
We're going to call the concentration of the activator a and the concentration of the inhibitor b.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.000
This constant right here shows us that yes in fact the activator is very slow moving

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000
as opposed to this constant over here which shows that the inhibitor acts on a much shorter time scale.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Back over in the equation for da/dt this factor of 1-aÂ²

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
limits the growth of a when a turns to 1 or turn -1.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
This is basically similar to logistic growth.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Back in the equation for db/dt, you see that when a is greater than 0 since a term of just +a

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
is added in, this forces both a and b upward.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Since we have -0.7b, however, whenever b is greater than 0

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
this forces a and b both downward.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Looking at the code, the final task of the problem is actually going to be to use

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.000
the explicit finite difference scheme for this activator-inhibitor model that I just showed you--

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
the equations for da/dt and db/dt.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000
However, before you get to that step, there are two other tasks that you must complete.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.000
Both task one and task two concern using periodic boundary conditions.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
Just to help you visualize this, I'm going to draw a little diagram.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000
We're considering a grid of some length by some length,

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000
and it's made up of all these little squares just like we've seen so many times before.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
We know how the conditions in this square relate to the conditions

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
in the adjacent square and so on and so forth.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
We can progress horizontally across the square until we reach the boundary.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Now, however, we have a problem.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000
What am I going to do with all the information that I have about this square?

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000
In the same way, where does the information about this square come from?

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.000
Periodic boundary conditions say if I pretend to create one more square

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000
outside of the boundaries of the grid then this square is going to be identical

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
to the first square on the opposite side where we started.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000
We can do the same thing moving in the opposite direction horizontally

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
and also in both directions vertically.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
So for task one and task two of this final problem, you're going to figure out

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.000
what expressions are needed to ensure that these boundary conditions are put in place.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000
In the end, you should come up with some pretty interesting looking patterns.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
I'm just going to give you a sneak peak of what you should end up with.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
So here's what you'll get with your final plot.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.000
You have one graph showing the concentration of the activator throughout the entire space

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.000
we're considering and the other graph showing the concentration of the inhibitor.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
Congratulations on some awesome work in this course.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
I hope you've had fun seeing how many different kinds of problems could be solved

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
using numerical approximation methods.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
I know that this course has taught me to look at the world in a totally different way.

00:03:42.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Great job on the final exam.
