00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:15.639
SUMMERSKILL: Indeed, I have no points--no
doubt that at some points in my lifetime,

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:23.820
the former Metropolitan University in this
country will have a grant from the EU to examine

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:32.590
why no one ever sits in the front row at an
event like this. And I do just owe you a small

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:38.970
apology, one thing I'm very mindful, none
of you is quite as decrepit as I am. One thing

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:45.760
you will find, if you get to the age of 48
and you are still too vain to wear a spectacles

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:53.559
in public, then if you speak in public, you
always find that the lectern is a little bit

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:58.550
further away than it was, the time before,
but mindful that to stay in a lectern, it

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:01.219
is placed
Slightly above my knees, you will forgive

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:09.400
if I speak without notes. Now, you--I'm going
to refer to some of the--the things in which

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:17.039
someone's is being engaged and I do think
sometimes those of us who live in this country,

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:19.829
in the beginning of the 21st century can almost
become a tiny bit complacent. And certainly

00:01:19.829 --> 00:01:31.590
with friends I have or friends and relatives
in America are starkly aware of how little

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:40.189
legislative protection that many gay people
have throughout the world, whereas in fact

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:47.049
in this country in the last six years alone
we have seen not just the complete Decriminalization

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:55.280
Act among gay people between 16 and 21, which
is a very real historic poison, but we've

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:02.549
seen the young instruction of gay people into
the armed services. We've seen the equalization

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:07.829
to the law around both fertility, treatment
and adoption, we've seen huge progress in

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:13.560
education with the abolition of section 28
and the new Equality Act which in some sense

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:19.410
is going to do the exact opposite of what
Section 28 did, which is positively requires

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:28.830
schools to support their lesbian and gay pupils.
And we've also seen a new offense of incitement

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:36.730
of hatred and hate crime protections to match
similar protections around race, and gender,

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:43.920
and disability, and of course, we've seen
civil partnership which affords lesbian and

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.630
gay people in this country, every single one
with the rights and entitlements of heterosexual

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:56.910
marriage, the rights and entitlements of course,
which most heterosexuals take for granted

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:05.450
from the day they were born. But in spite
of that catalogue of positive and progressive

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:12.760
changes, I'm certainly very aware to the fact
that, there has been and remain quite active

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:23.360
opposition to equality in this country from
small pockets of people and specific interest

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:31.170
groups. One of them I have to say is a rather
odd organization which styles itself the Christian

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:37.500
Institute, you know, it's not just all because
it so awfully sounds terribly Christian at

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:43.470
all when you listen to what they have to say,
but if you go into their Website, you'll see

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:52.140
the sorts of things that the Christian Institute
is interested in. They are in favor of spanking,

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:59.940
and they are against prostitution and they
are against pornography, although curiously

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:07.880
they seemed very keen to share with you details
of many of the sorts of pornography they are

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:17.750
against. And I was reminded on the way here,
of an encounter I had, actually, exactly five

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:25.120
years ago with someone from the Christian
institute. And five years ago our plans for

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:33.120
civil partnership during the summer of 2004
were actually wrecked in the House of Lords,

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:37.180
they were sabotaged. And we have to go back
to the House of Commons and go through the

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:44.210
committee stage and put the bill back together.
And it was one very warm afternoon just like

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:55.060
this, that I popped out of the committee session
in the Commons and I went to the loo and there

00:04:55.060 --> 00:05:03.980
in the loo's new mansion, what the loo's like
in the House of Commons, marble floor, wooden

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:09.140
paneling, a row of urinals stretching into
the middle distance. And there at the--the

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:19.900
very far urinal was the Policy Director of
this organization called the Christian institute.

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:28.260
Now, the boys among you, perhaps all the girls
will be aware that in such circumstances,

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:33.655
there is an etiquette. If someone is standing
at the urinal that's halfway--as far away

00:05:33.655 --> 00:05:43.900
from you as possible, if do you converse,
you should do exactly the same; stand as far

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:53.820
away from him as you can too. So, mindful
of this etiquette, and of course, my obligations

00:05:53.820 --> 00:06:02.630
to Stonewall, I went and stood at the urinal
immediately next to the man from the Christian

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:10.060
institute and I said, "How are you?" Because
I noticed he's been taking some Nurofen earlier

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:16.280
on, I said, "How are you?" And he said, "I'm
not well, people like you make feel ill."

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:25.230
And I was able to share with him which at
Stonewall, we say no to the use of pharmaceuticals,

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:36.110
but at times of stress we prefer to rely instead
upon the nourishment that comes from the power

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:44.050
of prayer. And I can say that ever since then,
whenever I have bump into the gentleman from

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:52.460
the Christian institute, he has looked at
me in rather an odd way. But he is still there

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:58.669
as are so many others, campaigning against
legislative equality. And I will just explain

00:06:58.669 --> 00:07:08.710
and I'm not going directly into semantics
of why the word equality is important to others.

00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:14.510
Something you'll often read in papers like
the Daily Mail, whose--in a way it campaigns

00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:20.150
the gay rights. Well, actually, we're not
really campaigners for gay rights. I've never

00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:27.460
wanted a single gay right in my life. I--like
so many other lesbian and gay people have

00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:34.990
just wanted exactly the same rights that everyone
else takes for granted and exactly the same

00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:45.330
treatment and exactly the same respect. But
of course, when in 2003, we saw the one bit

00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:51.680
of the legislative jigsaw--I've not mentioned
yet, which was workplace equality, protection

00:07:51.680 --> 00:08:00.250
from discrimination at work, introduced. They
were exactly the same sort of objections we've

00:08:00.250 --> 00:08:06.260
seen too--so much of our work. And I've already
drawn attention to my age, and so, it doesn't

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:13.580
matter if I do it again. I'm old enough to
remember and as I fear, not a single one of

00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:22.590
you is, and I understand, as any reference
to my age in relation to yours is a reference

00:08:22.590 --> 00:08:26.620
to my decrepitude as opposed to your healthy
youth. And I'm--I'm old enough to remember

00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:35.089
the introduction of the Sex Discrimination
Act in 1975, which of course provided equality

00:08:35.089 --> 00:08:41.760
of work to women for the very first time in
this country. And in the round up to the introduction

00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:49.779
of the Sex Discrimination Act, there were
letters almost every day in the letters column

00:08:49.779 --> 00:08:58.399
of the Daily Telegraph and Times, and they
were from the principals of Oxbridge Colleges

00:08:58.399 --> 00:09:06.200
and retired brigadiers and permanent secretaries
in Whitehall. And they were all complaining

00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:11.930
that all this equalities have all, all very
good--they had no objection to their treatment

00:09:11.930 --> 00:09:17.519
of women at all, but there was a problem that
have been overlooked. And it was that they

00:09:17.519 --> 00:09:24.730
all inhabited listed buildings and it would
cause terrible problems if they were required

00:09:24.730 --> 00:09:31.569
to provide women's lavatories in every one
of these listed buildings. Well, miraculously

00:09:31.569 --> 00:09:38.510
of course, the Sex Discrimination Act was
introduced 30 years ago; we've got through

00:09:38.510 --> 00:09:45.850
the intervening years of our noble island
history without invasion or plague being caused

00:09:45.850 --> 00:09:53.259
as a consequence of the desecration of listed
buildings, for the purpose of complying with

00:09:53.259 --> 00:10:00.629
the Sex Discrimination Act. And I was reminded
of all that once again, in December 2003,

00:10:00.629 --> 00:10:08.730
when all workplace protections came in. And
it was on the morning, Monday, the first of

00:10:08.730 --> 00:10:16.569
December 2003; and I was reading the Daily
Mail. I read the Daily Mail, so Stonewall

00:10:16.569 --> 00:10:22.990
supporters don't have to. And there among
its usual catalogue of scare stories, and

00:10:22.990 --> 00:10:29.360
those of you who've seen the Mail occasionally
will know about this, you know, fresh air

00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:34.319
causes cancer, if children played hopscotch
they'll get housemaid's knee. There on page

00:10:34.319 --> 00:10:40.921
two; amongst these catalogues of scare stories
was a firm prediction, drawing attention to

00:10:40.921 --> 00:10:48.869
this--these new protections to stop gay people
just being sacked for being gay. And the Daily

00:10:48.869 --> 00:10:56.910
Mail claimed, and as a consequence within
months, thousands and thousands of avaricious

00:10:56.910 --> 00:11:03.190
homosexuals would be suing their employers
for hundreds of thousands of pounds. Well,

00:11:03.190 --> 00:11:08.390
of course, curiously like so many predictions
in the Daily Mail, it didn't actually turn

00:11:08.390 --> 00:11:15.010
out to be true. And something we can certainly
say from our--our perspective at Stonewall

00:11:15.010 --> 00:11:21.610
is that hardly ever, do we come across people
who just want to sue their employers for thousands

00:11:21.610 --> 00:11:32.720
and thousands of pounds; almost, always where
we do come and to speak with who have difficulties

00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:39.069
at work that are related and genuinely related
to their sexual orientation, all they actually

00:11:39.069 --> 00:11:44.829
want to do is have the difficulties resolved,
so that they can continue to do the job and

00:11:44.829 --> 00:11:55.870
pursue the career that they have chosen. And
it was mindful of this that we set up a good

00:11:55.870 --> 00:12:03.660
practice program for employers. What we called
our Diversity Champions Program in 2002 in

00:12:03.660 --> 00:12:11.509
preparedness for the introduction of these
regulations. Now, that program happily now

00:12:11.509 --> 00:12:21.429
engages Google, it engages 500 major employers
in this country. And if you look on our Website,

00:12:21.429 --> 00:12:30.129
you can see that those employers do not in
some sense teach the necessary usual suspects

00:12:30.129 --> 00:12:38.100
of a progressive workplace activity. They
include IBM, and Barkley's and McKenzie in

00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:46.929
the private sector and the Royal Navy, and
now the Army and MI5 in the public sector

00:12:46.929 --> 00:12:53.449
and--I think most of you will appreciate those,
sorts of workplaces where people sit around

00:12:53.449 --> 00:13:01.029
in circles holding hands and singing Kumbaya.
There are actually workplaces that are absolutely

00:13:01.029 --> 00:13:07.880
focused on maximizing share-hold value in
the private sector or indeed on delivering

00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:15.149
world class public services in the public.
And we don't see that those objectives as

00:13:15.149 --> 00:13:21.079
being inimical to the delivery of equality
of fair treatment in the workplace. We see

00:13:21.079 --> 00:13:27.629
the delivery of equality, and respect, and
fair treatment for employees and staff as

00:13:27.629 --> 00:13:35.649
a way of delivering some of those organizational
objectives. I did actually point out to some

00:13:35.649 --> 00:13:43.980
people a few weeks ago, that it's interesting
to me but with five million people now going

00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:49.950
to work everyday in this country from Stonewall
Diversity Champion, that means, there are

00:13:49.950 --> 00:13:54.350
five times as many people going to work for
an employer with whom we engage, than there

00:13:54.350 --> 00:14:01.129
are who now go to the church of England every
Sunday. And I think that tells us something

00:14:01.129 --> 00:14:09.720
about the way this country is changing at
the beginning of the 21st century. When I

00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:16.309
pointed that out to the officers of the CPI,
I was told I sounded very liberal, so I was

00:14:16.309 --> 00:14:24.850
able to reassure the gentlemen, because they
all were at the CPI, that in fact, if current

00:14:24.850 --> 00:14:33.730
trends continue within two years time, there
will be more people going to work in this

00:14:33.730 --> 00:14:41.119
country everyday for the Stonewall Diversity
Champion than are actually trades unionists.

00:14:41.119 --> 00:14:47.839
For some reason that brought a smile to the
faces of the gentlemen of the offices the

00:14:47.839 --> 00:14:52.720
CPI and, but it is a demonstration for the
fact we don't kind of regard this as a political

00:14:52.720 --> 00:15:00.489
activity with a capital or even necessarily
a small fee. We regard it, as a way of unlocking

00:15:00.489 --> 00:15:06.800
value within these workplaces. So now, I'll
just say something if I may, about three or

00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:14.740
four of the key interventions that we've developed
or engaged in through our workplace activities

00:15:14.740 --> 00:15:22.810
in a--in an attempt to help unlock and some
of that potential from workforces. I mean,

00:15:22.810 --> 00:15:29.299
one of them which sounds stunningly obvious
and to people who are as cutting edge as all

00:15:29.299 --> 00:15:36.619
of you are, in terms of what you do at work,
the idea of setting up and publishing a lesbian

00:15:36.619 --> 00:15:39.319
and gay recruitment guide for graduates four
years ago and we're about to publish our fifth,

00:15:39.319 --> 00:15:51.049
it doesn't sound radical at all. But in fact,
we've been surprised at the huge amount of

00:15:51.049 --> 00:16:00.059
engagement we've had from people--undergraduates
and post graduates who are about to qualify--because

00:16:00.059 --> 00:16:04.321
for the first time they've had access to a
resource which has indicated to them, which

00:16:04.321 --> 00:16:11.339
employers might take them seriously and I
have to say, I find that a wholly healthy

00:16:11.339 --> 00:16:17.290
development. There's no doubt, whatsoever,
20 years ago, even 10 years ago, most gay

00:16:17.290 --> 00:16:23.019
people would never have dreamt of going to
an employer and saying, will you actually

00:16:23.019 --> 00:16:28.119
support my personal and professional development
if I'm gay? I think actually, quite a lot

00:16:28.119 --> 00:16:36.339
of women and people from back to minorities
and communities wouldn't have done that either.

00:16:36.339 --> 00:16:39.819
Of course, happily, younger people nowadays
are much more assertive about what they want

00:16:39.819 --> 00:16:43.239
from their workplace, and which quite often
they're going to commit, not just huge hours

00:16:43.239 --> 00:16:51.540
but actually many years of their working lives.
And we're delighted that young lesbian, and

00:16:51.540 --> 00:16:57.339
gay, and bisexual students are now prepared
to say to employers, you know, we don't want

00:16:57.339 --> 00:17:01.709
to be assured we're going to be treated differently,
we just want to be assured we will be treated

00:17:01.709 --> 00:17:07.520
with the same respect as everyone else in
your workplace. And I have to say, one of

00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:14.549
the most interesting feedbacks we've had from
the university career service in the last

00:17:14.549 --> 00:17:23.110
18 months, which now distributes that guide,
is they have actually found young heterosexual

00:17:23.110 --> 00:17:31.140
women using the Stonewall recruitment guide
too, because they acknowledge that so many

00:17:31.140 --> 00:17:38.210
employers, precisely 30 years after the introduction
of the Sex Discrimination Act, have kind of

00:17:38.210 --> 00:17:45.610
learned to talk the talk around gender and
indeed race. No employers would say, we don't

00:17:45.610 --> 00:17:52.470
really do anything around women and you know,
if you're a women, we want take you all to

00:17:52.470 --> 00:17:53.470
career development where your work are valued
very seriously, but employers who are prepared

00:17:53.470 --> 00:17:59.980
in 2007, 2008 and 2009, to be saying, we take
the issues of sexual orientation seriously,

00:17:59.980 --> 00:18:05.750
one of the most tricky issues to deal with
in some workplaces, that gives a signal. It's

00:18:05.750 --> 00:18:14.110
a benchmark to lots of programs and potential
recruits, that this is a sensitive and progressive

00:18:14.110 --> 00:18:22.429
workplace. I mentioned another--one of our
interventions, which I'm sad Google has not

00:18:22.429 --> 00:18:30.419
yet engaged in but that was the introduction
of an annual workplace equality days to showcase

00:18:30.419 --> 00:18:41.370
the 100 or 150 best employers for gay people
in Britain. And again, we know that is used

00:18:41.370 --> 00:18:47.299
widely by potential recruits. Not to found
out if they will somehow be celebrated for

00:18:47.299 --> 00:18:53.200
being gay if they turn up in the a workplace,
but to find out if they are actually considering

00:18:53.200 --> 00:19:01.830
working somewhere, that feels reasonably chilled,
and relaxed, and supportive about people regardless

00:19:01.830 --> 00:19:10.440
of difference. One of the hugely positive
and exciting developments for us in that piece

00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:18.799
of work every year was that for the publication
of this year's set of things, published in

00:19:18.799 --> 00:19:24.309
January. So, next year's will come out in
six months' time. For the publication of this

00:19:24.309 --> 00:19:32.250
year's index, we, for the first time allowed
and indeed encouraged employees of participating

00:19:32.250 --> 00:19:38.970
organizations to personally give testimony
about how they felt their employer performed

00:19:38.970 --> 00:19:48.409
in terms of providing a supportive environment
for lesbian and gay staff. And the thing we

00:19:48.409 --> 00:19:53.560
were, I'm fond to say, hugely delighted about,
as any of you who've—who have ever done

00:19:53.560 --> 00:20:00.210
diagnostic research will also know the feeling
we're hugely relieved about was for the first

00:20:00.210 --> 00:20:09.010
time we evidenced that staff were genuinely
expressing levels of higher satisfaction of

00:20:09.010 --> 00:20:15.990
work in those workplaces; was scoring well
in our index, in other words, in the workplaces

00:20:15.990 --> 00:20:20.690
that were doing this sort of things that we're
encouraging them to do. And those of you who

00:20:20.690 --> 00:20:27.970
specializes working in the area of the kind
of people, human capital, will know that that

00:20:27.970 --> 00:20:35.200
actually is a hugely important feature of
any of this kind of work. To be able to actually

00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:41.259
demonstrate, it's not just generally a good
thing, which involves compliance with a legal

00:20:41.259 --> 00:20:46.539
framework, to be able to demonstrate that
relatively low level investment in some of

00:20:46.539 --> 00:20:54.309
these issues leads to demonstrably higher
levels of staff satisfaction, is actually

00:20:54.309 --> 00:21:02.080
hugely, hugely important. And we were delighted
to see that happening. The third area of interventions

00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:09.399
I'll mention is becoming more important is
our work around leadership. We've developed

00:21:09.399 --> 00:21:16.610
with some people from the Kennedy School of
Government at Harvard, a leadership program

00:21:16.610 --> 00:21:24.409
for next generation lesbian and gay leaders.
We're actually moving it this year from Kennedy

00:21:24.409 --> 00:21:32.029
to Ashbridge and the reason that is critically
important for us is two-fold: First, we do

00:21:32.029 --> 00:21:36.250
take the few, that people who are gay and
lesbian who want--hold on one moment, I don't

00:21:36.250 --> 00:21:45.759
want to cause you any distress, we will get
there. We do take the few, the people who

00:21:45.759 --> 00:21:52.059
are gay and who may have unique skills, alright.
It doesn't make them better than people who

00:21:52.059 --> 00:21:59.059
aren't gay. Just is it doesn't make people
who are black better than people who are white

00:21:59.059 --> 00:22:05.409
as employees. But we are mindful that actually
people who come from minority communities,

00:22:05.409 --> 00:22:13.120
whether they be a black, or Asian, or lesbian
and gay have grown up, not only knowing how

00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:20.509
to engage with people who are different from
them but with an imperative of having to engage

00:22:20.509 --> 00:22:26.630
with people who are different from them. And
in many 21st century workplace is that, it's

00:22:26.630 --> 00:22:38.400
a hugely useful tool. And I can certainly
say, I mean, one of the first weeks, I was

00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:40.750
at Stonewall, Larry Hirst, who was then in
charge of IBM in this country said to me,

00:22:40.750 --> 00:22:44.170
he was very--even refreshingly talented, I
think it is something from he said about IBM

00:22:44.170 --> 00:22:50.980
around some of these issues. He was very talented,
but 30 years ago, an ideal recruit to IBM

00:22:50.980 --> 00:22:58.820
was, whether they admitted it or not, straight
white man, who have two children and played

00:22:58.820 --> 00:23:07.570
rugby at university. And the reason for that
was, 90 percent of the people that guy would

00:23:07.570 --> 00:23:12.210
work with, would be straight white men, who
have two kids and they played rugby at university.

00:23:12.210 --> 00:23:16.960
And probably 90 percent of the clients he
would come across would be straight white

00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:22.020
men, who had two kids and they played rugby
in university. So, it made perfect commercial

00:23:22.020 --> 00:23:27.940
settings for them to be recruiting people
who felt comfortable in that kind of environment,

00:23:27.940 --> 00:23:33.740
and of course, as Larry acknowledges and then,
and certainly, everyone here does, the reality

00:23:33.740 --> 00:23:43.560
in 2001, is that any recruit to IBM operating
global business that actually has got a hugely

00:23:43.560 --> 00:23:50.370
varied workforce, is not going to get on terribly
well, if there's only a small global staff

00:23:50.370 --> 00:23:56.250
they can engage with. And similarly, anyone
working externally for IBM, which is almost

00:23:56.250 --> 00:24:01.960
every single one of their staff is actually
operating in the global market, where they

00:24:01.960 --> 00:24:07.200
will be dealing with people who are profoundly
different in every way, on almost every--on

00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:14.840
almost everyday of the week. So, there are
opportunities, for we believe, for leaders,

00:24:14.840 --> 00:24:22.929
for next generation leaders to develop some
of their personal skills based on learning,

00:24:22.929 --> 00:24:29.990
and lived experience of their own lives. Which
as I say, does not make them better than heterosexuals,

00:24:29.990 --> 00:24:36.720
it just means, possibly they have a skill
base that can be developed or enhanced more

00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:41.379
quickly on that--on that basis. And I--I do
just say, the other reason, we are doing work

00:24:41.379 --> 00:24:46.769
on next generation leadership, is actually
precisely because of the work we've been doing

00:24:46.769 --> 00:24:54.769
around the matter of recruitment. And we have
seen in the last two years alone, a significant

00:24:54.769 --> 00:25:01.289
change of sentiment among young people, among
the--in the recruitment market who are now

00:25:01.289 --> 00:25:06.580
saying, well, we don't--if we go somewhere,
we expect they will be aware of the law, we

00:25:06.580 --> 00:25:12.759
expect they'll treat us with respect, the
real test for us about whether we would be

00:25:12.759 --> 00:25:19.090
supported and nurtured if we are lesbian and
gay and indeed--if we're black or Asian, the

00:25:19.090 --> 00:25:26.480
real test of that for an employer, is when
an employer can say, I can guarantee you that

00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:34.970
your career progression will be exactly the
same as anyone else's. And the only way employers

00:25:34.970 --> 00:25:42.080
can demonstrate that authentically of course,
is by saying, all you need to do is look at

00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:46.799
the top of our business, half of the most
senior people are women, 20 percent of them

00:25:46.799 --> 00:25:51.850
are from a black nation, 10 percent of them
are--are openly lesbian and gay and feel they

00:25:51.850 --> 00:25:57.769
are able to be open as lesbian and gay within
our corporate environment. And it is those

00:25:57.769 --> 00:26:03.200
businesses that are starting to develop competitive
advantage in some of these quite tight labor

00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:07.159
markets, because, as I said, they can demonstrate
authentically, not just that they believe

00:26:07.159 --> 00:26:16.700
in supporting people from all sorts of backgrounds
within their workplace, but the people have

00:26:16.700 --> 00:26:22.730
been supported and helped progress in their
careers. And I've just mentioned, finding

00:26:22.730 --> 00:26:28.170
relation to workplace, something we've started
doing and we've only started doing because

00:26:28.170 --> 00:26:35.169
no one else have ever done it and that is
research, not just the kind of--the slightly

00:26:35.169 --> 00:26:40.740
more diagnostic stuff around workplace equality
index and performance. But actually for the

00:26:40.740 --> 00:26:46.641
first time, and actually last year with the
support of IBM around productivity and we

00:26:46.641 --> 00:26:52.570
are starting to develop an evidence base,
which of course is perfectly intuitive. It's

00:26:52.570 --> 00:26:59.289
not actually rocket science, we are starting
to develop an evidence base, which proves

00:26:59.289 --> 00:27:07.259
about conclusively for the first time, about
when people can be completely open and relaxed

00:27:07.259 --> 00:27:14.360
at work, when people can be themselves, they
perform better. And as I said, that is something

00:27:14.360 --> 00:27:23.100
that we've known for some years, it's one
of those challenges to convert those sorts

00:27:23.100 --> 00:27:28.850
of assertions into--into the tougher hard
evidence, we are now clear the--we're beginning

00:27:28.850 --> 00:27:36.929
to see that. And I will just mention, if I
may, one other area of our work at present,

00:27:36.929 --> 00:27:40.320
which is important to us, because I think
there's a significant connected in this, and

00:27:40.320 --> 00:27:49.159
that is around schools and homophobic bullying.
Now, the reason for--as a connection, is two-fold.

00:27:49.159 --> 00:27:56.029
First, of course, the reality in schools is
exactly the same as in workplaces. If people--if

00:27:56.029 --> 00:28:03.940
young people who are growing up, feel they
are able to be themselves, they are more likely

00:28:03.940 --> 00:28:10.690
to be productive and successful. And we are
actually in the next couple of years going

00:28:10.690 --> 00:28:16.700
to start looking at some of those correlations
around children and young people in secondary

00:28:16.700 --> 00:28:22.610
schools. But the other reason we think, that
this work in schools, challenging homophobic

00:28:22.610 --> 00:28:29.129
bullying is terribly important, is that quite
frankly, they are important, not just beyond

00:28:29.129 --> 00:28:33.929
the services, I'm not saying the gentleman
from the CPI, other employers who say, "Oh,

00:28:33.929 --> 00:28:39.690
we don't, you know, like people being homophobic,
or sexist, or racist but they arrived out

00:28:39.690 --> 00:28:46.889
of our education system, with those prejudices
and we are somehow being expected to challenge

00:28:46.889 --> 00:28:52.220
those prejudices once they've entered the
workplace." But it seems to us it's perfectly

00:28:52.220 --> 00:28:59.539
proper that those prejudices should be challenged
as early as they emerge and certainly our

00:28:59.539 --> 00:29:05.039
educational program which was set up about
four years ago and is now supported by a coalition

00:29:05.039 --> 00:29:12.710
of 70 national organizations, ranging from
children's charities to teaching unions. That

00:29:12.710 --> 00:29:18.809
program has actually uncovered some deeply
disturbing evidence. We did the first ever

00:29:18.809 --> 00:29:26.350
survey, a couple of year ago of young people
growing up lesbian and gay in British secondary

00:29:26.350 --> 00:29:36.999
schools and that found that 60% of them, more
than 60% are--were regularly the victims of

00:29:36.999 --> 00:29:41.659
homophobic bullying. A third of that is, one
in five of that group of young people were

00:29:41.659 --> 00:29:46.740
regularly the victims of physical homophobic
bullying, and perhaps the most shocking of

00:29:46.740 --> 00:29:51.990
all, a third of those incident of bullying
were actually being perpetrated by adults

00:29:51.990 --> 00:30:02.730
in the schools that those young people were
attending. And some of the young people we've

00:30:02.730 --> 00:30:06.830
meet—on our first residential program, starting
in Thursday for young lesbian and gay people

00:30:06.830 --> 00:30:15.730
to help them develop their own programs, to
challenging homophobic bullying in the schools.

00:30:15.730 --> 00:30:18.700
But some of those young people we've meet
have been hugely arresting. And I came across

00:30:18.700 --> 00:30:27.780
a guy, a couple of years ago now who was at
a school in west London and he said, well,

00:30:27.780 --> 00:30:34.799
finally, finally after two years, the school
have done something to stop him being assaulted

00:30:34.799 --> 00:30:41.260
at going to and from the school. And the school
in fact has not dealt with the perpetrators.

00:30:41.260 --> 00:30:47.144
They had provided him with a security guard
to accompany him home at the end of the school

00:30:47.144 --> 00:30:58.779
day. And last year, we came across a girl
who was at a Faith school in the West Country

00:30:58.779 --> 00:31:04.929
and she perhaps incautiously have said to
one of her teachers, at the age 14, she thought

00:31:04.929 --> 00:31:11.460
she might be a lesbian and when that girl
contacted us that she had--since that disclosure

00:31:11.460 --> 00:31:20.770
being required to sit outside the changing
rooms at the beginning and end of sports lessons

00:31:20.770 --> 00:31:30.190
while the normal children have got changed.
And we are certainly alive to the fact, that

00:31:30.190 --> 00:31:35.389
if those sorts of prejudices aren't oppressed
and challenged in schools, then of course,

00:31:35.389 --> 00:31:42.919
it's no surprise that people grow up, validated
in a belief that that not just abusing but

00:31:42.919 --> 00:31:50.799
attacking lesbian and gay people is a perfectly
acceptable thing to do. And in the last three

00:31:50.799 --> 00:31:56.249
years alone, we've seen the murder of Jody
Dobrowski in South London; we've seen the

00:31:56.249 --> 00:32:01.129
murder of Michael Holzer in Liverpool, last
year. And there was an incident, six or seven

00:32:01.129 --> 00:32:10.830
months ago, a young man, Ollie Helmer in East
London who was attacked with a broken bottle

00:32:10.830 --> 00:32:17.879
by a man screaming homophobic abuse and that
bottle severed his spinal cord and he will

00:32:17.879 --> 00:32:26.799
never work again. And that took place in what
is meant to be one of the most tolerant, diverse

00:32:26.799 --> 00:32:33.429
and progressive cities in this country. So
we are, under no illusions about the challenges

00:32:33.429 --> 00:32:50.779
that still face us. But we are driven and
we continue to be driven by our vision at

00:32:50.779 --> 00:33:01.360
Stonewall, we do have a vision of a Britain
that one day, every single person will not

00:33:01.360 --> 00:33:13.330
just be entitled to fair treatment and respect
but will be afforded fair treatment and respect.

00:33:13.330 --> 00:33:50.590
And we have vision of a Britain where one
day every single child will grow up to secure

00:33:50.590 --> 00:34:10.390
every ounce of their potential, and we have
a vision of a Britain where one day, no human

00:34:10.390 --> 00:34:17.010
life will be overshadowed by hatred, or prejudice,
or fear. And I know that there are some of

00:34:17.010 --> 00:34:26.330
you who have already helped us, there are
many of you, in the future who will help us

00:34:26.330 --> 00:34:33.830
in building that Britain within our lifetimes
and we're very grateful to you indeed. I was

00:34:33.830 --> 00:34:39.419
told to talk for 40 minutes and it's now
20 to two.

00:34:39.419 --> 00:34:52.100
&gt;&gt; Quite on the nail, thank you very much
for that. Is there anybody got any questions?

00:34:52.100 --> 00:35:02.210
&gt;&gt; I suppose there are, like, a gay soldier,
I mean, what is your opinion what is your

00:35:02.210 --> 00:35:07.210
opinion on the [INDISTINCT] within the army
today?

00:35:07.210 --> 00:35:15.660
&gt;&gt; SUMMERSKILL: Well, I--I mean, it's interesting
actually, the gays in the military thing is

00:35:15.660 --> 00:35:25.320
something where some gay people is—during
an address a few years ago, I was asked to

00:35:25.320 --> 00:35:39.050
list on how things are going, and I mentioned
gays in the military and dear old Peter Thatcher

00:35:39.050 --> 00:35:52.140
was sitting in the audience and starting shouting
out, shame, shame and you know, I have to

00:35:52.140 --> 00:36:00.340
say our view of the gays in the military,
it was simply that gay people should have

00:36:00.340 --> 00:36:12.200
the right to serve their country, if they
wish to do so, in exactly the same way as

00:36:12.200 --> 00:36:21.900
everyone else. And certainly since we've been
doing, I mean, the Royal Navy was the first

00:36:21.900 --> 00:36:32.210
of the armed service we started to work with.
Three and half years ago, the Navy, we started

00:36:32.210 --> 00:36:50.540
it at the beginning of last year. I think
there is no reason, I'm like, a very good

00:36:50.540 --> 00:37:19.010
friend of Peter; I'm always not making grandiose
claims about evidence. But I think there is

00:37:19.010 --> 00:37:31.530
no reason to think that lesbian and gay people
are not as widely represented in the armed

00:37:31.530 --> 00:37:40.700
services already as they are in wider--in
the wider population. This in fact is an awful

00:37:40.700 --> 00:37:48.130
lot who have never--have never--not able to
come out and an awful lot of them of course

00:37:48.130 --> 00:37:51.550
in those particular occupations challenge
some of the preconceptions about what lesbian

00:37:51.550 --> 00:37:57.160
and gay people look like. And I think one
of the most difficult things we've dealt with

00:37:57.160 --> 00:38:04.430
and we are aware that there are currently
lesbian and gay personnel serving in--still

00:38:04.430 --> 00:38:12.170
in Iraq. There are some in Afghanistan, in
Kosovo, in theaters of active service. And--well,

00:38:12.170 --> 00:38:20.940
I think something we are alive to is the fact
that quite often and it's not unique for uniform

00:38:20.940 --> 00:38:34.910
services. They still find it extremely difficult
to come out, if you work in a small cohort

00:38:34.910 --> 00:38:46.740
of people for 15 years and never being, you
know, in which you do get put in and quite

00:38:46.740 --> 00:38:59.270
pressured. So, even more pressured than doing
a pitch to a client and to actually be able

00:38:59.270 --> 00:39:03.540
to turn around after all that time, and say,
well, listen, I never told you; can still

00:39:03.540 --> 00:39:06.630
be really challenging for them. But something
I'm, you know, really chaffed about, is we

00:39:06.630 --> 00:39:17.980
are aware that within the last few months,
there have been personnel from the U.S. Navy

00:39:17.980 --> 00:39:26.840
at Fort Smith, talking to people about the
work we've been doing. And I think you can

00:39:26.840 --> 00:39:34.400
probably draw your own conclusions about the
reason they're there and why they think that

00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:38.810
that might be a sensible thing to be preparing
for.

00:39:38.810 --> 00:39:45.470
&gt;&gt; You mentioned the church, [INDISTINCT]
a few times. As an active biblical Christian

00:39:45.470 --> 00:39:55.720
that's sort of interesting, do you have any
sense of how much of the opposition that you

00:39:55.720 --> 00:40:03.830
run into, at least claims to be faith based
and how much active support you are getting

00:40:03.830 --> 00:40:11.300
from all the goings of the church?
&gt;&gt; SUMMERSKILL: I mean, there's no doubt whatsoever,

00:40:11.300 --> 00:40:25.300
a significant part of the opposition to equality
in this country, and actually quite often,

00:40:25.300 --> 00:40:34.450
the significant party opposition to equality
for women in this country has been faith based.

00:40:34.450 --> 00:40:45.430
However, as with so many people who claim
to speak on behalf of large sums of other

00:40:45.430 --> 00:40:56.660
people we are not convinced there is the evidence
for that, and certainly, we know, I mean,

00:40:56.660 --> 00:41:07.400
we did a piece of research about a year ago,
into the views of people of faith around Britain

00:41:07.400 --> 00:41:15.300
about homosexuality and we very deliberately,
though we were asked to, didn't kind of go

00:41:15.300 --> 00:41:26.630
from to a bit research to say, well, if you
read the Koran in this way, you know, it'll

00:41:26.630 --> 00:41:36.660
be gay and if you read the Bible in this way,
there's nothing wrong with homosexuality,

00:41:36.660 --> 00:41:44.440
because that's--we know that the opponents
of equality aren't susceptible to those arguments.

00:41:44.440 --> 00:41:54.780
So, we could package them slightly, more elegantly,
it wouldn't actually make any difference.

00:41:54.780 --> 00:42:09.310
What we did was going toward--though focus
groups across, actually, the north of England,

00:42:09.310 --> 00:42:22.730
two groups of Christians and Sikhs, and Muslims.
And almost all of them were crystal clear

00:42:22.730 --> 00:42:29.760
that they were significantly less homophobic
than, you know, their so called faith leaders.

00:42:29.760 --> 00:42:38.280
And I am reminded, I mean, it's a very sensitive
subject and it's a territory that's often

00:42:38.280 --> 00:42:45.570
not pushed out, because within, you know,
kind of British public realm, all you have

00:42:45.570 --> 00:42:55.620
to do is say, I'm a Bishop and somehow that
is meant to entitle you to be taken more seriously

00:42:55.620 --> 00:43:16.790
than someone else who's wandering off the
street wearing a pink frock. And we have to

00:43:16.790 --> 00:43:32.550
be careful about it, but, you know, I think
it is important about the challenge and I

00:43:32.550 --> 00:44:09.080
know, I mean, at least, reveals to me to be
real sadder than last year, I did watch probably

00:44:09.080 --> 00:44:31.130
the first four or five days of Big Brother,
I rented it this year, not like the rest of

00:44:31.130 --> 00:44:39.751
the country. I've—not sure which to, or
watching none at all, and on--at the end of

00:44:39.751 --> 00:44:50.660
I think it was the first week of Big Brother
last year. There was a woman in the Big Brother

00:44:50.660 --> 00:45:01.070
house who got terribly upset, because they
had participant in this guy called Mohamed,

00:45:01.070 --> 00:45:08.970
who wore a dress and she's taunting off and
she said that absolutely ridiculous, we're

00:45:08.970 --> 00:45:13.590
Muslims, Mohamed, you know, you mustn't do
this, people would think, you're homosexual.

00:45:13.590 --> 00:45:19.000
Now, this woman have been drinking repeatedly,
she--I'm--use my words carefully here, did

00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:27.700
not seem to be a stranger to the details of
sexual congress, even if presumably she had

00:45:27.700 --> 00:45:29.451
never had it herself. She certainly dressed
immodestly, she smoke and she swore like a

00:45:29.451 --> 00:45:30.451
trooper. I have great difficulty in thinking
about her objections to Mohamed wearing a

00:45:30.451 --> 00:45:31.451
dress was really motivated by her being a
devout Muslim, you know, I am--clearly viewed

00:45:31.451 --> 00:45:32.451
her objections to Mohamed wearing a dress
as simply, she's a bit homophobic. And I do

00:45:32.451 --> 00:45:35.870
think it's important but that sort of thing
is challenged and you have to challenge it

00:45:35.870 --> 00:45:38.040
in the right way, and certainly I wouldn't,
you know, single out Muslims for one moment,

00:45:38.040 --> 00:45:39.040
I mean, like Christians, you know, we shouldn't--there's
no hierarchy of prejudice and indeed the people

00:45:39.040 --> 00:45:40.040
who've seek to be prejudicial or to demonstrate
their prejudice against minority communities

00:45:40.040 --> 00:45:41.080
in this country, it's a virtue. Usually, very
keen to say, no, I'm more homophobic than--than

00:45:41.080 --> 00:45:47.840
the mere chief rabbi, and but the simple fact
is, there is an awful lot of homophobia in

00:45:47.840 --> 00:45:55.860
this country that is kind of dressed up as
religious--as a religious belief. And you

00:45:55.860 --> 00:45:59.830
know, we only have to look and again, I'm
going through those stuff that people go to

00:45:59.830 --> 00:46:03.450
before in Leviticus but, I mean, you know,
Bishops' wives are not cross examined whether

00:46:03.450 --> 00:46:09.400
they're having sex once they've ceased menstruating,
which is as serious--a failing as far as Leviticus

00:46:09.400 --> 00:46:14.470
is concerned is homosexuality, yet miraculously,
you know, we're just told about some little

00:46:14.470 --> 00:46:18.890
bit of history and it's traditionally would
be taken too seriously in the old testament

00:46:18.890 --> 00:46:20.130
is indicative, except of course, when it's
not.

00:46:20.130 --> 00:46:25.790
&gt;&gt; In light of the question, in terms of kind
of like organized [INDISTINCT] to legislation,

00:46:25.790 --> 00:46:31.220
is that Bishop Blair [ph]?
&gt;&gt; SUMMERSKILL: I don't think it's Bishop—I

00:46:31.220 --> 00:46:46.390
mean I think there are--you know, there are
some bishops who still sits in the House of

00:46:46.390 --> 00:46:52.540
Lords. I mean if I was running a failing business,
I would be encouraged to go back and attend

00:46:52.540 --> 00:47:03.190
to my customers rather than disappear to London
for three days or a month. But nevertheless,

00:47:03.190 --> 00:47:07.560
some of it is the more extreme bishops, you
know, some of it is on the fundamentalist

00:47:07.560 --> 00:47:15.480
of all sorts, you know, who don't like homosexuals.
And that's, you know, that's the reality.

00:47:15.480 --> 00:47:18.520
And I mean, one of the interesting things
has happened in the last 10 years. As I think

00:47:18.520 --> 00:47:22.590
they've, you know, and you only need to look
at these sorts of things that someone like

00:47:22.590 --> 00:47:26.081
Lord Tebbit, nowadays, what he says about
homosexuals. A lot of these people have learned

00:47:26.081 --> 00:47:27.081
to just speak in a slightly more well-mannered
way because if they were saying nowadays,

00:47:27.081 --> 00:47:28.081
the sort of things they felt it was perfectly
acceptable in the same public domain 10 years

00:47:28.081 --> 00:47:32.350
ago, 20 years ago, people would say, you know,
I think it would be odd. So they've learned

00:47:32.350 --> 00:47:38.460
to be slightly more elegant about ventilating
their prejudices. I think, exactly, the same

00:47:38.460 --> 00:47:46.200
is true actually, around, you know, lots of
issues that involve women, you know, that

00:47:46.200 --> 00:47:55.110
people. You'd never get anyone nowadays now
saying, "Oh, we don't want women working in

00:47:55.110 --> 00:48:02.660
this office." What they'll do is they'll,
you know, address the topic and with all the

00:48:02.660 --> 00:48:05.790
concerns about career commitment, or are they're
going to stay around and, you know, they take

00:48:05.790 --> 00:48:09.250
time off and all that kind of stuff. So it
doesn't mean that the underlying prejudice

00:48:09.250 --> 00:48:11.510
among some small [INDISTINCT] is not still
very strong.

00:48:11.510 --> 00:48:12.670
&gt;&gt; You mentioned you work with some organization
that were 90% straight white male and--in

00:48:12.670 --> 00:48:14.000
their demographic, how do you engage to increase
[INDISTINCT] that, that like what happen [INDISTINCT]

00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:15.000
to any members?
&gt;&gt; SUMMERSKILL: Like--I'm not sure I mentioned

00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:18.320
organizations nowadays are 90% straight white
men but--and I think and one of the core principles

00:48:18.320 --> 00:48:28.070
of the work we do around people is that it's
actually about diversity in difference right

00:48:28.070 --> 00:48:50.500
across the board. Now, that's when we, you
know, and we went and delivered strategies

00:48:50.500 --> 00:48:56.540
around sexual orientation. But we actually
think you have to get that understanding in

00:48:56.540 --> 00:49:02.942
the first place. And one of the reasons for
that is precisely--that actually, it's about

00:49:02.942 --> 00:49:05.790
respecting all sorts of differences. And I
can say, one of the most interesting things

00:49:05.790 --> 00:49:09.430
and partly, actually historically being one
of the businesses that are happier to share

00:49:09.430 --> 00:49:10.430
some of their internal stuff externally. One
of the most interesting things--and I found

00:49:10.430 --> 00:49:11.430
in my first couple years in work, also in
Barkley's, where they started stratifying

00:49:11.430 --> 00:49:12.430
a number of cohorts in their workforce, including
sexual orientation. And we encourage them

00:49:12.430 --> 00:49:13.430
to ask question, do you feel comfortable at
work, because there are quite among them who

00:49:13.430 --> 00:49:14.500
wouldn't quite articulate if they think that
they are the victims of homophobia but actually

00:49:14.500 --> 00:49:17.060
they still don't feel that comfortable at
work. So we introduced a lot of question about

00:49:17.060 --> 00:49:21.040
work [indistinct] for satisfaction. One of
the really fascinating resources to that research

00:49:21.040 --> 00:49:22.971
is that Barkley's pick up a cohort of straight
men, who said, they didn't feel comfortable

00:49:22.971 --> 00:49:23.971
at work. And when they did drill them down
with their permission, and they say to the

00:49:23.971 --> 00:49:29.040
staff, "Can we come back to you and I'll ask
you details?" They said, yes, they did. They

00:49:29.040 --> 00:49:30.040
found that this group of men, were men who
wanted to take advantage of family friendly

00:49:30.040 --> 00:49:31.060
working which lots of lots of women in Barkley's
were doing. But when they did it, they got

00:49:31.060 --> 00:49:34.610
picked on to use—and so, and it's—so,
women could say, I'm going to work eight till

00:49:34.610 --> 00:49:40.691
three and everyone says, that's fantastic,
but the man who said the same was made to

00:49:40.691 --> 00:49:43.510
feel deeply, deeply uncomfortable. And that,
you know, seems to be some perfect example

00:49:43.510 --> 00:49:44.510
of how taking approach is right across the
board about accommodating people whatever

00:49:44.510 --> 00:49:46.820
their difference or however they want to deliver
their work, is actually one way of binding

00:49:46.820 --> 00:49:47.820
in, commitments and understanding right across
the piece too. There's one more.

00:49:47.820 --> 00:49:48.820
&gt;&gt; I just want to ask, what can we do? Is
there--are there--[INDISTINCT]?

00:49:48.820 --> 00:49:54.260
&gt;&gt; SUMMERSKILL: Well, I think one of--I mean,
one of the object--I was, because I was thinking

00:49:54.260 --> 00:49:56.210
it's easy to sometimes to just--you can do
the--we must all do the best and make the

00:49:56.210 --> 00:49:58.340
best effort and the best of all possible worlds
and it makes everyone feel very good. And

00:49:58.340 --> 00:50:00.610
then they go in, you know, I'm not sure what
that means. I'm--I actually think, one of

00:50:00.610 --> 00:50:06.760
the challenges organization is to say, you
know, are we going to be in the position in

00:50:06.760 --> 00:50:07.760
five years time when we can say six% of our
highest paid staff are openly lesbian and

00:50:07.760 --> 00:50:10.170
gay. And actually start having that organizational
discussion and because that's a clear, you

00:50:10.170 --> 00:50:13.780
know, clear objective. I mean, the six percent
we use for the level the lesbian-gay population

00:50:13.780 --> 00:50:20.580
because of the treasury attributaries. Now
the use six%, they used, again, some of you

00:50:20.580 --> 00:50:22.970
will know this end result whatsoever, whether
it was 10% or 2% or 20%, I found the moment

00:50:22.970 --> 00:50:23.970
that you say, that's what treasury attributaries
say. Those people decide we'd rather not go

00:50:23.970 --> 00:50:28.010
and have a discussion and we think or sense
is that's was about the level, that's probably,

00:50:28.010 --> 00:50:30.150
recently accurate. So will we be in the position
at Google and in five years time, we can say

00:50:30.150 --> 00:50:31.150
6% of our hundred--six of our hundred most
senior people are completely open and relaxed

00:50:31.150 --> 00:50:32.150
that they're and encouraging other people
to follow their career paths. And the way

00:50:32.150 --> 00:50:36.860
we'll get there, you know, in terms of practical
support in, is many--I mean, we've been mentoring

00:50:36.860 --> 00:50:38.760
at various level of since the very--is a very
useful tool and it's one way of--we're developing

00:50:38.760 --> 00:50:39.760
at the moment. So the gentleman…
&gt;&gt; [INDISTINCT]

00:50:39.760 --> 00:50:40.760
&gt;&gt; SUMMERSKILL: Yes.
&gt;&gt; [INDISTINCT]

00:50:40.760 --> 00:50:41.760
&gt;&gt; And when, when was the moment [INDISTINCT]?
&gt;&gt; SUMMERSKILL: Well, it will--being requested…

00:50:41.760 --> 00:50:42.760
&gt;&gt; And INDISTINCT] that need [INDISTINCT]
nevertheless. [INDISTINCT]…

00:50:42.760 --> 00:50:43.760
&gt;&gt; SUMMERSKILL: Well, because it was last
year and the year before and this year is

00:50:43.760 --> 00:50:44.760
not due until the 5th of September. And I
do just say, that, you know, there are some

00:50:44.760 --> 00:50:46.150
organizations and I don't know what local
decisions are taken. There are some organizations

00:50:46.150 --> 00:50:47.280
where there's a sensitivity about doing it
because of what had become known through faith.

00:50:47.280 --> 00:50:48.280
&gt;&gt; They've done it in the States, I know…
&gt;&gt; SUMMERSKILL: Oh, exactly, exactly. Although

00:50:48.280 --> 00:50:49.280
here I have to say our index here is slightly
more challenging than the HRC on--and of which

00:50:49.280 --> 00:50:51.540
enables you to get to 100 percent and then
everyone says, oh, isn't that fantastic. I

00:50:51.540 --> 00:50:58.950
mean it is more actually challenging. But
one of the reasons we feel completely comfortable,

00:50:58.950 --> 00:51:03.650
I mean, if someone is 95th in that index,
there's still 95th of a group of a hundred

00:51:03.650 --> 00:51:04.650
and we don't do the kind of naming and shaming
at the HRC on a dozen Americans. We just ensure

00:51:04.650 --> 00:51:05.650
that it works in terms of getting the organization
to change, but you can come 95th and still

00:51:05.650 --> 00:51:06.650
be celebrated. And the other thing people
get sensitive about is they do move around.

00:51:06.650 --> 00:51:07.650
They actually went down a little bit last
year. The reason for that is quite simple,

00:51:07.650 --> 00:51:08.650
that the external labor market is constantly
changing and actually improving. So, if employers

00:51:08.650 --> 00:51:09.650
continue to do what they were doing last year
or the year before, then actually relative

00:51:09.650 --> 00:51:10.650
terms, they will almost certainly become less
preferred. And I do say--and I have to say

00:51:10.650 --> 00:51:11.650
this briefly, it's one of the things we've
only often found with public sector, the employers.

00:51:11.650 --> 00:51:12.650
That there's a kind of sense in the public
sector, certainly local government, oh, you

00:51:12.650 --> 00:51:13.650
know, we were getting beaten up for doing
equal opportunities 20 years ago. So we must

00:51:13.650 --> 00:51:14.650
be impressive. The problem is there are not
awful a lot of this public sector who haven't

00:51:14.650 --> 00:51:15.650
really move forward in the last 20--they're
doing exactly what we were doing 20 years

00:51:15.650 --> 00:51:16.650
ago, when it was right here and when it really
was radical and difficult and challenging.

00:51:16.650 --> 00:51:17.650
But if all they're doing is what we were doing
a decade ago or two decades ago, then actually

00:51:17.650 --> 00:51:18.650
in comparison with an awful lot of other employers
that they don't think about—and they don't

00:51:18.650 --> 00:51:19.650
look about further. Now, I'm mindful that
those of you who will, who now ask and notice

00:51:19.650 --> 00:51:20.650
too, that at Stonewall, we always intend to
deliver on time, on budget and above specification,

00:51:20.650 --> 00:51:20.665
so in order to meet this first of those KPIs,
I need to stop now.
