00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.540
Mathematical morphology has this huge
science behind it that's a very abstract

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:07.310
algebra because in some sense,
it's all about set theory.

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:08.060
Right?
I mean, basically,

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:08.700
that's what you're doing.

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.120
You've got these binary sets, and then
you do these operations on sets, and

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.320
then there's gray level morphology.

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.830
You won't find much of it in
the computer vision literature anymore.

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:19.940
When I say computer vision,

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:23.150
I mean conferences that use the word
computer vision in their title,

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:25.900
like computer vision pattern
recognition, European conference on

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.340
computer vision, the international
conference on computer vision.

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:31.340
You won't find a lot of things,
people doing work on morphology.

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:34.670
But if you go to certain, pattern
analysis kinds of things where they're

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:39.690
doing syntactic operations, you'll still
find mathematics of that, being done.

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.240
However, even though it doesn't appear
in this computer vision research,

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:44.970
we use it all the time.

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:46.760
Because we use it to
clean up our results.

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.460
In order to be able to get those great
results that we can brag about to our

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:54.200
our, our colleagues, or

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:59.126
to get paid by industrial folks to
build systems that actually work.

00:00:59.126 --> 00:01:03.555
So I think of think of this as not sexy,
but very important.

00:01:03.555 --> 00:01:07.805
I had a whole bunch of jokes to follow
that and I couldn't use any of them.

00:01:07.805 --> 00:01:10.975
So I'll just say that,
it's kind like me.

00:01:12.165 --> 00:01:13.385
All right.

00:01:13.385 --> 00:01:13.885
Talk to you later.
