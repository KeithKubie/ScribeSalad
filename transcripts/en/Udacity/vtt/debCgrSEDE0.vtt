00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:02.558
&gt;&gt; Kagure, why is Sickle cell anemia en,

00:00:02.558 --> 00:00:05.730
endemic to regions like Kenya and, and Africa?

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.230
&gt;&gt; So, it's higher in the region

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:12.130
because it provides resistance, some resistance to malaria.

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:16.329
&gt;&gt; I see. So malaria is a common sickness?

00:00:16.329 --> 00:00:17.400
&gt;&gt; Yes, definitely.

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:18.180
&gt;&gt; Definitely.

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.790
&gt;&gt; I've had malaria, everyone else in my family has had malaria too.

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:24.030
&gt;&gt; Really? What's it like to have malaria?

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:25.670
&gt;&gt; you,

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:28.910
malaria is, like the flu.

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:29.073
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:00:29.073 --> 00:00:32.369
&gt;&gt; I've never had the flu, but from what people describe the flu as.

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:32.725
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:00:32.725 --> 00:00:35.710
&gt;&gt; You get dizzy, you get nauseous, you're, you get achy

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:40.150
joints. when I had malaria, I remember being very dizzy, dizzy

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:43.250
enough that the floor seemed very far away and like it

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:47.918
was teetering. And you're just kind of out. You get a fever.

00:00:47.918 --> 00:00:48.246
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:00:48.246 --> 00:00:48.720
&gt;&gt; The usual.

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:50.810
&gt;&gt; And how does the, and I mean, how does

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:51.740
malaria spread?

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:54.470
&gt;&gt; Malaria is spread through mosquitoes.

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:55.587
&gt;&gt; Through mosquitoes.

00:00:55.587 --> 00:00:56.044
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:00:56.044 --> 00:00:58.090
&gt;&gt; And so, we, the best way to combat that

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:01.470
then is just like, bug spray or bug nets or something?

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:03.666
&gt;&gt; So, the best way would be, you don't want

00:01:03.666 --> 00:01:06.911
to have pools of water, stagnant water, outside your home.

00:01:06.911 --> 00:01:07.386
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:01:07.386 --> 00:01:09.640
&gt;&gt; because they're attracted to that. So if

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:11.240
you had a drum of water just sitting

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.410
outside your window. You going to get a bunch

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:15.930
of mosquitoes just hanging out waiting for nighttime, or

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:22.380
whenever. you also want to have a mesh, screens on your windows

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.110
and doors, so that when you do need to open your windows, bugs can't get in.

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.490
And then another way, if you can't do all of that, is you need

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:35.641
to have mosquito nets over your beds. At night because that's the time when.

00:01:35.641 --> 00:01:36.193
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:01:36.193 --> 00:01:39.700
&gt;&gt; They're likely to strike when you're just kind of lying there and still.

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:41.420
&gt;&gt; Wow so you're

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:44.000
pretty sure most people are sure that when they get malaria

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.680
is because you know mosquito bit them at some point, probably.

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:47.220
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.140
&gt;&gt; And so it's pretty common. You've had

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:51.910
it, you said everyone in your family's had it?

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:54.420
&gt;&gt; Right. Have you, do people get it multiple times?

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:54.840
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.040
&gt;&gt; Say, i, is there treatment for it?

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:02.540
&gt;&gt; There is treatment for malaria. You go to the

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:07.920
hospital or clinic or your doctor and you get medication.

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.820
I'm not sure what it was exactly. I think

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:11.780
you take it for granted because it's so common.

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:12.135
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:02:12.135 --> 00:02:15.070
&gt;&gt; You just go in and they prescribe you something. And you get better.

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:17.460
&gt;&gt; How long does it take to get better?

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:21.210
&gt;&gt; I know people who go back to work or to school after three

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:25.510
days. And then I know people who'll stay home sick for a few weeks. It

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:28.590
just depends on the person and how early you caught it as well. I

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:32.980
tend to catch mine early because my stomach hurts and then, for me that's the

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:35.080
main symptom and then I kind of ignore that.

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.633
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:02:35.633 --> 00:02:37.790
&gt;&gt; Whereas with others if they're just feeling a little under the

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.050
weather, they'll think to themselves I'm just a little tired, I'll go home.

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:45.190
&gt;&gt; So you mention that the reason sickle cell

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:48.520
anemia is higher in Kenya is because it provides some

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:52.140
resistance to malaria, but if you have one allele

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:57.110
for, the sickle cell how exactly does it provide resistance?

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:58.090
&gt;&gt; So I think

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:59.860
what it is when you have sickle cell anemia

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:02.400
is that your red blood cells are crescent shaped.

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:02.720
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:08.460
&gt;&gt; And this makes it makes some resistant to infection from the parasite.

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:11.180
&gt;&gt; I see so it's sort of trade off then. I mean

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:15.740
sickle cell anemia doesn't sound like a good thing but neither's malaria

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.765
[LAUGH].

00:03:15.765 --> 00:03:16.865
And.

00:03:16.865 --> 00:03:17.160
&gt;&gt; True.

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:22.420
&gt;&gt; So if it provides some advantage then

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:25.820
that's probably why it's more prevalent in the region.

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:30.590
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think that's true. But then, isn't there something

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:34.890
about sickle cell anemia where you don't live past a certain, where

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:37.350
more people with sickle cell anemia will not live past a

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:40.920
certain age. And so in that way with malaria you can get

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:43.590
treatment and live to be 80 and then with sickle

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:49.250
cell anemia, it, you're more likely to have a shorter lifespan.

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:51.440
&gt;&gt; That's a really good point. So the

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:53.270
while if you have sickle cell anemia, you

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:56.750
have to have two copies of the allele to have sickle cell. If you're just a

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:59.880
carrier, you have one copy, which provides resistance

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:01.730
against malaria too, but you don't have any

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:04.040
of the symptoms of anemia. But you raise

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:05.940
a really interesting point though, that actually our

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:09.650
treatment of malaria means that you don't, there's

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:12.590
no natural selection happening as much. Or there's

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:15.430
not as much happening because we don't, you

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:17.899
don't need the sickle cell to protect you from

00:04:17.899 --> 00:04:19.970
malaria as much because now we have drugs

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:22.540
right. So you're not going to die from malaria

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:25.820
as frequently when we have drugs. And now

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:31.850
that means that okay, the sickle cell allele actually

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:35.520
isn't being naturally selected for anymore. So although

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:39.010
we have drugs to treat malaria and help

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:41.640
you get better, sickle cell anemia, the alleles

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:44.150
still exist but actually it's not being selected for

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:47.390
anymore. But it's so prevalent in the region,

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:49.480
but as you move away from regions that

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:52.130
are stricken with malaria, you don't see the

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:56.910
sickle cell allele. At all,really. if you could give

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:59.360
advice to somebody who either is going to a region

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:02.930
with malaria, or is, you know, grown up in a region

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:05.370
and has just gotten malaria for the first time, do

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:09.100
you have any advice what to do when you get malaria?

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:10.948
&gt;&gt; Well, first of all, for someone going

00:05:10.948 --> 00:05:12.796
to an area that has malaria, I would say

00:05:12.796 --> 00:05:13.076
[LAUGH]

00:05:13.076 --> 00:05:15.764
you need to go get yeah, anti-malaria tells, you want to

00:05:15.764 --> 00:05:18.770
go. You want to be prepared because you probably don't have

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:25.920
resistance to the parasite yet. And so it's important

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:29.840
to go to a travel clinic or wherever, and get.

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:30.440
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:34.540
&gt;&gt; Something anti-malaria pills, for someone whose having it

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:37.980
for the first time. See a doctor, don't take chances,

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:42.000
don't let stay too long because it can kill you.

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:46.020
and that's pretty much it. Don't freak out, there's treatment.
