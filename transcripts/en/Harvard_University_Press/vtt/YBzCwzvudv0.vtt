00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:08.000
I don't believe literature as such can open
doors. I believe that literary reading is

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.469
something that needs to be taught. And I believe that in the past, in different kinds of polities,

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:20.309
cultural instruction of this sort perhaps  was given not necessarily only through the university.

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:29.000
But today, if it is taught as such, what you are taught is how to suspend yourself in another's text--

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.480
which is basically training for the
ethical impulse. You know, An Aesthetic Education

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:43.240
is a book that's been sort of growing on me. I feel more and more--since I'm not a technophobe--

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:50.720
I think we ought to be able to use the resources of the digital and so on for advancing humanity's

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:58.520
education. But I do feel that in order to
be able to use those resources, we need exceedingly

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:04.199
well-trained minds, minds that are trained
in the interests of the humanities,

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:14.359
which are not always identical with some of the issues associated with the digital, like speed,

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:22.759
like distant learning, and so on. And so therefore
I felt that, strangely enough, in order to

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:32.180
be ready to use our resources for the world
as we find it now, we should also focus on

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:39.439
training the imagination in a way that could
help the world remain ready for, also for

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:45.649
ethical interventions, and so on. So I have
been thinking about this for some time, and

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:52.469
I felt that the resources that were developed in the 18th and 19th centuries in Europe should

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:59.310
be used in a way that I now call "affirmative
sabotage." That is to say, you know, the idea

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:08.119
of sabotage is that you make an instrument, you can't use it anymore if you sabotage it.

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:14.150
My sense is that you should actually turn
it around, so that you can use it for something else.

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:20.380
Why throw away beautifully developed
tools? And so, and I'm a Europeanist after all.

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:31.840
So, what I do in the text is use Schiller's
aesthetic education, which tried to do something

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:37.870
comparable, that is to say train minds so
that they would be able to use what were the

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:47.489
beginnings of capitalism, resources in the
interest of the humanities. I try to bring

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:53.750
them forward, and turn them around a bit,
so that they can use the resources that are

00:02:53.750 --> 00:03:00.599
available now in globalization. This is, as I
said, it's been growing on me, so it's kind

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:04.499
of work in progress, presented now.

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:13.100
I have a feeling that the ways of looking at literature that we had,

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:21.100
we thought were new ways, you
know, the postcolonial for example, or cultural studies,

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:29.200
critique of Eurocentrism, expansion
of the canon, I felt that in what we now call

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:33.720
globalization, those ways of thinking, they're very important, they should be used,

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:40.440
surely we don't reject them, but they're not exactly what we need anymore, because there is a certain

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:47.450
kind of simultaneity or contemporaneity to
today's world which asks for something else.

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:58.180
Rather than the tradition/modernity opposition, we really need to think of everything as modern,

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:04.740
and so that, you know, there is a certain
kind of level playing field idea, which is fine,

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:10.240
that's what's happening. But on the
other hand, if you begin to look at it carefully,

00:04:10.249 --> 00:04:17.249
you see that at the same time, this level
playing field is also up and down like a relief map.

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:25.260
And that's where the challenge comes.
So, I feel that these ways of thinking,

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:34.380
not just shared by me, but shared by many people on sort of the radical fringes of literary criticism,

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:42.080
need to be rethought, retooled,
relocated, and this book is an attempt

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:44.020
to see if that can be done.
