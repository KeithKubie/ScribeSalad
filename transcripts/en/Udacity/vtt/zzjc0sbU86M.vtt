about our world and to be open and prefer new experiences, for instance foods,

00:00:09.033 --> 00:00:15.884
people, places and kinds of music. It's also connected to being curious,

00:00:15.884 --> 00:00:21.350
creative and imaginative. On the other end of the spectrum, low openness to

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:25.765
experience, we have a preference for the tried and true to the unknown. A

00:00:25.765 --> 00:00:31.000
preference for the familiar to the unfamiliar. And a preference for the

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.040
realistic to the imaginative.
