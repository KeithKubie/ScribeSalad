VINOD MARUR: Hi, everyone.

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:03.400
How is everyone doing?

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:04.859
Excited?

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:06.900
So for those that don't
know me, I'm Vinod Marur.

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:09.160
I'm a VP in the search
[INAUDIBLE] quality team

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:11.140
here at Google.

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:13.420
Over the years,
we've had the fortune

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:17.440
of hosting some amazing
musicians and artists.

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:21.480
I've been in your seats, eagerly
awaiting their appearance

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.980
and wanting to ask
them questions.

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:26.950
But it is an
exceptional honor to be

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:29.150
able to host someone
of the caliber

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:33.180
and the type of repertoire
that Ustad Zakir Hussain brings

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.860
to us today.

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.190
As many of you know, Ustadji
has won numerous awards--

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:42.330
the Padma Shri, the Padma
Bhushan, the National

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:47.240
Fellowship for Arts,
National Endowment, and also

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:50.770
two Grammys, just to name a few.

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:52.550
I did not realize
this until recently,

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:57.650
but he began learning
tabla at the age of three.

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:00.090
And he was touring
by the age of 11.

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.140
His first tour to the
United States was in 1970.

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:10.830
And his typical concert
here has 150 concert days.

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.700
Just think about the
mind-boggling volume of that.

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.290
And as I said, I've
been a huge fan.

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.140
I remember seeing
Ustadji at places

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.400
like [INAUDIBLE]
and Prithvi Theatre

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:25.177
in Bombay, Madison Square
Garden in New York City,

00:01:25.177 --> 00:01:27.510
and, of course, closer to
home at the San Francisco Jazz

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:28.530
Center.

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.690
So it's really a personal
privilege for me,

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:34.150
and please join me in a
huge round of applause

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:35.945
in welcoming Ustadji to Google.

00:01:35.945 --> 00:01:40.912
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:54.059 --> 00:01:55.350
ZAKIR HUSSAIN: Hello, everyone.

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.280
Good afternoon.

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:58.750
Namaste.

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:03.920
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH],
whatnot, everything.

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:04.920
It's great to be here.

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.320
Thanks for having me.

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:07.240
VINOD MARUR: Thank
you for being here.

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:08.823
ZAKIR HUSSAIN: Did
you just say that I

00:02:08.823 --> 00:02:10.912
played 150 concerts daily?

00:02:10.912 --> 00:02:13.610
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:14.776
That would be a trick.

00:02:14.776 --> 00:02:16.720
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.770
I'd say maybe 150 or
so a year at one time.

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:27.680
But now I'm semi-retired,
So maybe 160.

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.838
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:34.910
VINOD MARUR: Well,
as someone who's

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:38.310
been following you, even
getting three of those a year

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:39.920
is just exhilarating.

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:41.910
And again, thank you
so much for being here.

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:43.950
I understand you've just
come in from London.

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:45.950
ZAKIR HUSSAIN: Yeah, I
just came in from London.

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:55.400
I went to do the London premier
of my concerto for tabla

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:00.120
and symphony orchestra at
London's Royal Festival Hall

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.730
for the Alchemy Festival.

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:05.760
So that happened about three
days ago, four days ago.

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:09.130
And I had been commissioned
to write this piece.

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:13.000
It's the world's
first tabla concerto

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.090
involving the full symphony
orchestra, like a San Francisco

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:19.880
Symphony or something.

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:26.930
So it's now being premiered
in Bombay-- sorry, Mumbai

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:33.810
and Switzerland-- actually
Bumbai-- Switzerland, and now

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:34.510
London.

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:39.140
And its American premier
is slated for next April

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:43.600
at the Kennedy Center
with the National Symphony

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:46.480
Orchestra, which is the
Kennedy Center Orchestra,

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:49.680
and then some other
concerts all over America.

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:51.854
So that's the new thing.

00:03:51.854 --> 00:03:53.020
VINOD MARUR: That's awesome.

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:55.840
And so sometime next year
we should stay tuned to--

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:58.510
ZAKIR HUSSAIN: You might be able
to see it here maybe at the San

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:05.440
Jose Symphony or at the
very amazing Google Symphony

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:06.426
Orchestra.

00:04:06.426 --> 00:04:08.400
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.200
Fondly known in
Maharashtra as "Googlay."

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:15.760
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:17.760
VINOD MARUR: Or in cricket
terms, it's "Googly."

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:20.274
ZAKIR HUSSAIN: "Googly."

00:04:20.274 --> 00:04:21.690
VINOD MARUR: So
as you can see, we

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:23.440
have a ton of what
we call Googlers.

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:25.850
We call ourselves Googlers
here, keeping with the theme.

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:28.370
ZAKIR HUSSAIN: And
we are Googleplex?

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:30.350
VINOD MARUR: Yes, we
are the Googleplex.

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:32.760
We also have folks who've
joined us via YouTube.

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:34.250
ZAKIR HUSSAIN: Oh,
hello, YouTube.

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:35.220
Hi, folks.

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:37.080
VINOD MARUR: And
we have questions

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:41.340
from folks in the audience, as
well as folks inside Google,

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:44.330
but also your fans worldwide
who have submitted questions.

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:47.170
So you'll see some of
them come up today.

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:49.990
ZAKIR HUSSAIN: Wow, that's
very kind of them to tune in.

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:54.630
And I'm flattered that
you took the time out

00:04:54.630 --> 00:05:01.770
to come and see me and hear
whatever BS I have to speak.

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:04.270
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:06.724
VINOD MARUR: So
to get started, I

00:05:06.724 --> 00:05:08.890
thought it would be interesting
to have a little bit

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:10.640
of a word-association game.

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:12.141
ZAKIR HUSSAIN: Word association.

00:05:12.141 --> 00:05:12.640
OK.

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:15.098
VINOD MARUR: So if you can just
tell us what's on your mind

00:05:15.098 --> 00:05:17.260
when you hear any
of these words.

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:21.000
Take us through your journey
of those words, if you will.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.710
Family.

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:25.402
ZAKIR HUSSAIN: [SINGING RHYTHMS]

00:05:25.402 --> 00:05:27.780
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:29.180
Love, actually.

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:29.880
VINOD MARUR: OK.

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:31.171
ZAKIR HUSSAIN: What's the next?

00:05:31.171 --> 00:05:32.630
VINOD MARUR: Travel.

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:33.567
ZAKIR HUSSAIN: Pain.

00:05:33.567 --> 00:05:36.550
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:37.850
It is a four-letter word.

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:39.850
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:43.230
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
it must be musical.

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:44.940
ZAKIR HUSSAIN: Oh,
it has to be musical?

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:46.020
AUDIENCE: The pain, too.

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:47.603
ZAKIR HUSSAIN: Pain
has to be musical?

00:05:47.603 --> 00:05:48.550
Oh, wow.

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:50.850
[SNAPPING] Pain.

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:54.410
[APPLAUSE]

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:56.600
VINOD MARUR: That is amazing.

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:58.910
Technology.

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:00.350
ZAKIR HUSSAIN: Future.

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:02.433
VINOD MARUR: I'm glad you
didn't say "pain" again.

00:06:02.433 --> 00:06:04.028
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:08.240
VINOD MARUR: Teamwork.

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:09.902
ZAKIR HUSSAIN: Respect.

00:06:09.902 --> 00:06:10.860
VINOD MARUR: Thank you.

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:17.460
So you started learning
at the age of three.

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:19.670
Is there anything you
remember from that time?

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:21.086
ZAKIR HUSSAIN:
Well, first of all,

00:06:21.086 --> 00:06:26.740
I don't think I started actually
learning at the age of three.

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:30.790
I don't think I really had
a say in when I actually

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:31.690
started learning.

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:33.720
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:36.290
You're in a music home,
you're in a musician's home,

00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:39.235
you're in a drummer's house, and
he happens to be your father.

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:44.240
From the day you're
brought in from the nursing

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:49.740
home where you were born,
you really are inducted.

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:50.890
You don't have a choice.

00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:53.790
And so it was the same with me.

00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:56.630
What happened with me was
when I was brought home,

00:06:56.630 --> 00:06:59.490
I think the second
day after I was born,

00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:01.900
and they hadn't yet
chosen a name for me.

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:04.480
So it was Baby Qureshi.

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:06.020
That's our family, Qureshi.

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:08.510
So could have been
male, female, whatever.

00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:10.360
They weren't sure.

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:15.010
Anyway, so even nowadays, I
sit in an airplane in a seat,

00:07:15.010 --> 00:07:16.890
and a stewardess comes
from here and says,

00:07:16.890 --> 00:07:18.640
can I get you something, ma'am?

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:20.225
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:20.225 --> 00:07:21.600
It's got something
to do with it.

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:22.550
I don't know.

00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:29.170
So I was brought home, handed
up to my dad in his arm,

00:07:29.170 --> 00:07:32.970
and the tradition
was, OK, the father

00:07:32.970 --> 00:07:37.540
is supposed to recite a
prayer in the baby's ear

00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:41.350
welcoming the baby and
put in some good words.

00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:45.980
So he takes me in his arm,
puts his lips to my ear,

00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:49.320
and recites rhythms.

00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:52.450
He did, [SINGING RHYTHMS]
And my mother was livid.

00:07:52.450 --> 00:07:54.140
She said, what are you doing?

00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:58.970
You're supposed to say
prayers, not these rhythms.

00:07:58.970 --> 00:08:01.740
And he said, but
these are my prayers.

00:08:01.740 --> 00:08:03.270
This is how I pray.

00:08:03.270 --> 00:08:06.990
He said, I am the worshipper
of Goddess Saraswati,

00:08:06.990 --> 00:08:08.590
Lord Ganesha.

00:08:08.590 --> 00:08:11.380
And this is a devout
Muslim talking.

00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:14.950
And this is the
knowledge, or [INAUDIBLE],

00:08:14.950 --> 00:08:16.810
I got from my teachers.

00:08:16.810 --> 00:08:18.510
And I want to pass
it on to my son.

00:08:18.510 --> 00:08:20.980
He is going to do exactly this.

00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:25.720
So why not start him early
and give him these prayers?

00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:30.100
So that's what I mean when
I say inducted already.

00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:31.250
I had no say in it.

00:08:31.250 --> 00:08:36.270
Like it or not, you're not going
to hear [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:08:36.270 --> 00:08:36.809
or whatever.

00:08:36.809 --> 00:08:40.620
You're going to actually
hear [SINGING RHYTHMS]

00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:42.419
and like it or not.

00:08:42.419 --> 00:08:45.530
So from there on, I think
it was his routine every day

00:08:45.530 --> 00:08:51.350
to sit for an hour or so or
two singing rhythms in my ear.

00:08:51.350 --> 00:08:55.748
And the way he held me, this
ear was closed, so it stayed in.

00:08:55.748 --> 00:09:00.430
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:00.430 --> 00:09:04.750
So anyway, those went
in, so by the time

00:09:04.750 --> 00:09:09.710
I was three when I could
actually reach the tabla

00:09:09.710 --> 00:09:16.570
and had hands slightly bigger
to get on to the tabla,

00:09:16.570 --> 00:09:18.200
I already had all
this information

00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:21.640
in my head and this
big jumbled confusion,

00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:23.810
which I had really no
idea what to do with.

00:09:23.810 --> 00:09:29.900
And so that's when the tabla
was put in front of me.

00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:33.320
And I started to hit it.

00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:37.010
And at that point,
my father decided

00:09:37.010 --> 00:09:39.860
to use reverse psychology.

00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:42.240
So now instead of putting
rhythms in my ear,

00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:44.600
he just disappeared.

00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:48.440
It's like, OK, no more
learning or hearing

00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:53.540
those nice little things which
put me to sleep, none of that.

00:09:53.540 --> 00:09:57.240
I was suddenly having
to fend for myself.

00:09:57.240 --> 00:10:00.100
And I guess his
whole plan was not

00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:04.520
to overdose me with this stuff
so I would just go away and not

00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:05.630
want it.

00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:08.570
It was more like giving
me a little taste of it,

00:10:08.570 --> 00:10:12.200
and then he pulled back to see
what I was going to do with it.

00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:16.440
And at that age, I was
being put on a spot

00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:22.630
to make a decision, to
commit to this or whatever.

00:10:22.630 --> 00:10:26.550
And so I guess my--
what should I say?

00:10:26.550 --> 00:10:32.580
The feelings or my instinct
brought me to commit to it.

00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:37.210
And I started playing with it,
and if I didn't have the tabla,

00:10:37.210 --> 00:10:41.940
I would see my mother's pots
and turn them around and play.

00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:44.320
Once or twice I did it
with the food in it.

00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:46.110
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:46.110 --> 00:10:49.360
So you know what that did.

00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:54.070
So anyway, that's how it all
began at the age of three

00:10:54.070 --> 00:10:57.120
till when I was seven.

00:10:57.120 --> 00:10:59.990
I rarely saw my dad.

00:10:59.990 --> 00:11:02.350
I'm sure he was
lurking about, looking

00:11:02.350 --> 00:11:05.600
to see what I was doing,
whether I was interested or not.

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:07.980
But it was mostly his students
who would occasionally

00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:10.250
show me or do this or do that.

00:11:10.250 --> 00:11:13.150
And they would speak something,
and I would already know it,

00:11:13.150 --> 00:11:14.626
because it was already here.

00:11:14.626 --> 00:11:17.000
And then it was a matter of
just putting on to the drums,

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.080
so it started becoming easy.

00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:22.960
But once I was about
seven years old,

00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:25.680
I had already started
doing school concerts,

00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:30.200
playing in my school things,
inauguration day, this day,

00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:31.250
that day.

00:11:31.250 --> 00:11:35.180
So on one of those occasions,
he came to the school

00:11:35.180 --> 00:11:37.540
to hear me play.

00:11:37.540 --> 00:11:41.620
And I played, and that was
done and after that went home.

00:11:41.620 --> 00:11:44.460
And at dinner, he
says to me, do you

00:11:44.460 --> 00:11:47.470
want to study this seriously?

00:11:47.470 --> 00:11:51.310
And I jumped at it, because
this man, being with him

00:11:51.310 --> 00:11:53.510
and having him there, so
I said, yes, of course.

00:11:53.510 --> 00:11:55.990
So he said, OK,
tomorrow we're start.

00:11:55.990 --> 00:11:59.160
So that was a very
exciting night for me,

00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:02.030
except for it ended early.

00:12:02.030 --> 00:12:04.970
He woke me up at 3:00 AM.

00:12:04.970 --> 00:12:06.330
I was seven years old.

00:12:06.330 --> 00:12:10.960
And so when everybody
slept and it was quiet,

00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:16.730
no phones ringing, no nothing,
we sat like this on our veranda

00:12:16.730 --> 00:12:20.730
and spoke rhythms and talked
about the masters, talked

00:12:20.730 --> 00:12:25.030
about this great tradition
and where it came from

00:12:25.030 --> 00:12:27.890
and what it represented
and the importance of it

00:12:27.890 --> 00:12:31.580
and the reverence that it
requires et cetera, et cetera,

00:12:31.580 --> 00:12:32.220
et cetera.

00:12:32.220 --> 00:12:35.720
And for the next few years,
that became the routine

00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:37.210
for a seven-year-old.

00:12:37.210 --> 00:12:40.570
Get up at 3:00 AM, sit
with him till 6:00,

00:12:40.570 --> 00:12:43.730
have breakfast, get
ready, go to school,

00:12:43.730 --> 00:12:50.020
but on the way to school,
detour to the madrasa,

00:12:50.020 --> 00:12:54.960
learn to recite the Quran,
and then cross the street

00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:59.760
and assemble in the St.
Michael's high school church

00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:05.150
and sing the hymns and then
go to the classroom and start

00:13:05.150 --> 00:13:09.730
learning, come home, and
then after lunch practice.

00:13:09.730 --> 00:13:11.180
So that became the routine.

00:13:11.180 --> 00:13:17.970
So I went to a confusing, for
many people-- being connected

00:13:17.970 --> 00:13:22.930
to Lord Ganesha and Lord Shiva
and Krishna and Saraswato

00:13:22.930 --> 00:13:29.380
from between 3:00 and 6:00 AM
and then between 7:00 and 7:45

00:13:29.380 --> 00:13:33.970
dealing with the Quran and
from 8:00 to about 8:20

00:13:33.970 --> 00:13:36.530
dealing with the church and
the hymns and the psalms

00:13:36.530 --> 00:13:39.090
and so on and then,
of course, going

00:13:39.090 --> 00:13:41.910
to school and then the tabla.

00:13:41.910 --> 00:13:43.780
But what was
interesting about that

00:13:43.780 --> 00:13:53.210
was none of these institutions
ever imposed their will on me

00:13:53.210 --> 00:13:55.850
or any of my fellow students.

00:13:55.850 --> 00:14:00.770
It appeared to be a
natural thing to do.

00:14:00.770 --> 00:14:03.540
It felt like a
normal thing to do.

00:14:03.540 --> 00:14:06.630
It wasn't like, OK,
I was doing something

00:14:06.630 --> 00:14:10.100
that the mullahs in the
neighborhood would not like

00:14:10.100 --> 00:14:15.040
or something that
the pundits will ban

00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:16.500
or whatever, none of that.

00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:21.680
And I was not made to feel
like I should do this and not

00:14:21.680 --> 00:14:23.470
that, do that and not that.

00:14:23.470 --> 00:14:25.160
It all appeared to
be part of one thing,

00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:28.050
as it is, as it should be.

00:14:28.050 --> 00:14:31.490
I mean, neither the Bible
or the Torah or the Quran

00:14:31.490 --> 00:14:34.800
or the Gita or
Ramayana, whatever, none

00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:37.280
has said anything different.

00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:40.050
They've all said
love thy neighbor.

00:14:40.050 --> 00:14:44.300
And that's basically
the gist of it.

00:14:44.300 --> 00:14:47.170
And it appeared to be
that way in my childhood.

00:14:47.170 --> 00:14:51.930
So I grew up, married my
wife Toni, who is here.

00:14:51.930 --> 00:14:55.290
We had three ceremonies.

00:14:55.290 --> 00:14:58.807
I have to give three wedding
anniversary presents.

00:14:58.807 --> 00:15:01.550
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:01.550 --> 00:15:03.210
Life is not easy,
I'm telling you.

00:15:03.210 --> 00:15:05.510
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:05.510 --> 00:15:08.000
So we first did
the civil marriage.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:12.990
Then we did the church
wedding because the family.

00:15:12.990 --> 00:15:15.560
And then to appease
my father and mother,

00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:17.970
we did the Muslim
nikah ceremony,

00:15:17.970 --> 00:15:20.890
so in three different
time of the year.

00:15:20.890 --> 00:15:25.100
If it would have happened on one
day, it would have been easy.

00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:27.520
But now I have to remember
three wedding anniversary

00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:32.890
dates on three different times
of the year and all that.

00:15:32.890 --> 00:15:35.680
And that and my
kids being baptized

00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:42.250
and all that, it has not
felt that I'm struggling

00:15:42.250 --> 00:15:48.020
to have all these thought
processes in any way

00:15:48.020 --> 00:15:49.680
co-exist in my mind.

00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:51.460
And this comes from
in the childhood

00:15:51.460 --> 00:15:54.500
being exposed to all of
this as something normal.

00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:58.050
And it was same with my music.

00:15:58.050 --> 00:16:02.590
Everybody says 2,000-year-old
history and you have to play 20

00:16:02.590 --> 00:16:07.260
hours a day for 20 years and
then you might be able to get

00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:09.390
some sound out of
the instrument.

00:16:09.390 --> 00:16:14.130
I think that's pure
BS, but that's just me.

00:16:14.130 --> 00:16:18.210
But I was never subjected
to that kind of thinking.

00:16:18.210 --> 00:16:21.380
I was always like, OK,
do it, and it's normal,

00:16:21.380 --> 00:16:23.600
it's fun, take it easy.

00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:27.900
So without the pressure,
I was able to study.

00:16:27.900 --> 00:16:31.720
So there were different
periods from day two

00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:34.780
till three, ding, ding,
ding, ding, ding, ding,

00:16:34.780 --> 00:16:37.720
ding; from three to seven,
pat, pat, pat, boom, boom,

00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:40.430
boom pat-pat, ch-ch-chh,
all that stuff.

00:16:40.430 --> 00:16:43.830
And then from seven
onward, really

00:16:43.830 --> 00:16:47.870
getting involved into the mantra
with my dad in the mornings

00:16:47.870 --> 00:16:49.960
and then studying.

00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:54.120
And then up till about the
age of 11 or 12, that carried.

00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:58.700
And then I played my first
professional concert in India

00:16:58.700 --> 00:17:02.970
at the age of 12,
got 100 rupees, man.

00:17:02.970 --> 00:17:05.859
You could buy a lot of
carrot halwah with that.

00:17:05.859 --> 00:17:09.119
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:09.119 --> 00:17:12.160
Many gulab jamuns
later, I said, oops,

00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:14.280
I should bring some of
this leftover money home,

00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:15.505
shouldn't I?

00:17:15.505 --> 00:17:17.130
VINOD MARUR: Well,
now we know a couple

00:17:17.130 --> 00:17:19.420
of your favorite desserts at
least for your next visit here.

00:17:19.420 --> 00:17:19.960
ZAKIR HUSSAIN: Wow.

00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:20.459
Good.

00:17:20.459 --> 00:17:21.952
Thank you.

00:17:21.952 --> 00:17:24.160
VINOD MARUR: So you mentioned
your wife, who is here.

00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:25.609
Thank you so much
for joining us.

00:17:25.609 --> 00:17:27.234
ZAKIR HUSSAIN: And
my daughter is here.

00:17:27.234 --> 00:17:29.570
VINOD MARUR: Yeah, your
daughter, too, Isabella.

00:17:29.570 --> 00:17:31.065
How did you all meet?

00:17:31.065 --> 00:17:32.530
ZAKIR HUSSAIN: How did we meet?

00:17:32.530 --> 00:17:35.010
Well, there was this
Jack in the Box.

00:17:35.010 --> 00:17:39.480
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:42.950
No, actually, I don't know
if it was meant to be,

00:17:42.950 --> 00:17:47.660
but it just so happens that my
first-ever concert in America

00:17:47.660 --> 00:17:51.890
was in a concert hall in New
York called Fillmore East.

00:17:51.890 --> 00:17:54.230
We have a Fillmore
West here in the city

00:17:54.230 --> 00:17:57.550
next to the dosa place.

00:17:57.550 --> 00:18:01.430
Anyway, so Fillmore
East, and that

00:18:01.430 --> 00:18:05.240
happen to be with
Pandit Ravi Shankar.

00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:08.920
I came in, because my
father was not feeling well,

00:18:08.920 --> 00:18:11.240
and so he was not
able to make it.

00:18:11.240 --> 00:18:13.430
And I just happened to
be next door in Germany.

00:18:16.020 --> 00:18:19.430
And believe me, in those
days for an 18-year-old,

00:18:19.430 --> 00:18:20.880
it was a piece of cake.

00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:24.000
Walk into the American Embassy,
give them your passport, say,

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.080
I want a visa to go to America.

00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:28.380
Oh, no problem.

00:18:28.380 --> 00:18:30.590
10 minutes later, you
have your passport,

00:18:30.590 --> 00:18:32.480
nothing like, do
you have a ticket?

00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:34.480
You have somebody who's
going to look after you?

00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:36.170
Where are your
bank balance sheets

00:18:36.170 --> 00:18:40.270
and all that-- nothing, none of
that stuff and your appointment

00:18:40.270 --> 00:18:42.590
letters, none of that.

00:18:42.590 --> 00:18:46.260
So he said, come over from
Munich and play with me.

00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:51.600
So I went to the embassy, got
the visa, arrived in New York.

00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:53.220
There's another story to that.

00:18:53.220 --> 00:18:58.580
But that was my first concert,
and it was on February 22.

00:18:58.580 --> 00:19:03.590
And that is my wife's birthday,
my first-ever concert.

00:19:03.590 --> 00:19:04.880
So maybe it was destined.

00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:06.340
Maybe, I don't know.

00:19:06.340 --> 00:19:10.100
But I arrived, played
with Ravi Shankar.

00:19:10.100 --> 00:19:12.260
Then I ended up in
University of Washington

00:19:12.260 --> 00:19:15.850
in Seattle as an assistant
professor teaching.

00:19:15.850 --> 00:19:18.120
I was 19 then.

00:19:18.120 --> 00:19:19.670
And so I was teaching there.

00:19:19.670 --> 00:19:22.010
And then out of the blue, I
get a call from [INAUDIBLE]

00:19:22.010 --> 00:19:25.190
Ali Akbar Khan, the
great sarod maestro,

00:19:25.190 --> 00:19:29.050
who has his music college
in Marin, and said,

00:19:29.050 --> 00:19:31.210
my tabla player
has upped and gone.

00:19:31.210 --> 00:19:34.090
Would you come and teach?

00:19:34.090 --> 00:19:38.920
So any tabla player in the
world would give his left leg

00:19:38.920 --> 00:19:40.170
to do that.

00:19:40.170 --> 00:19:41.550
Hands you can't get.

00:19:41.550 --> 00:19:43.920
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:47.080
Or a thumb or like
[INAUDIBLE] or whatever.

00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:52.400
Anyway, so I said yes, and
I gave up my university job

00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:55.560
and came down to
Marin and joined.

00:19:55.560 --> 00:19:58.250
And a few months
later, I was sitting

00:19:58.250 --> 00:20:04.070
in Ali Akbar Khan's living
room, and we were just there.

00:20:04.070 --> 00:20:08.550
And in walks Toni, because she
had heard about the college

00:20:08.550 --> 00:20:12.085
and met a friend of hers who was
going to come to the college,

00:20:12.085 --> 00:20:12.960
et cetera, et cetera.

00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:14.390
There is a story there.

00:20:14.390 --> 00:20:17.580
And then she ended up there,
and that's where we met.

00:20:17.580 --> 00:20:21.290
And that night, she
came to see me play.

00:20:21.290 --> 00:20:23.520
And that sealed it, I think.

00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:27.310
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:27.310 --> 00:20:32.770
It's like, OK, he can't speak or
anything, but he sure can play.

00:20:32.770 --> 00:20:36.860
And she actually was impressed
with the dance there.

00:20:36.860 --> 00:20:38.590
There was a dance department.

00:20:38.590 --> 00:20:41.820
And so she started taking
Kathak dance there.

00:20:41.820 --> 00:20:46.180
And then we sort of met
more often, and then

00:20:46.180 --> 00:20:48.130
I asked her out.

00:20:48.130 --> 00:20:53.670
And then she had this great idea
of what Indian musicians are,

00:20:53.670 --> 00:21:01.720
very proper and vegetarians
and all that stuff.

00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:04.110
So on our first date, I
took her to Jack in the Box.

00:21:04.110 --> 00:21:06.260
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:06.260 --> 00:21:09.180
That's all I could afford in
those days, I mean, you know,

00:21:09.180 --> 00:21:10.190
or maybe.

00:21:10.190 --> 00:21:12.490
And then we went into
Sausalito, looked at the moon,

00:21:12.490 --> 00:21:15.010
had an ice cream, and so on.

00:21:15.010 --> 00:21:18.700
But I think what really
clinched it was one night she

00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:21.470
lost her contact lens.

00:21:21.470 --> 00:21:25.230
It was dark on the street out
there, outside on the street.

00:21:25.230 --> 00:21:26.200
And I found it.

00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:28.900
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:28.900 --> 00:21:33.630
[APPLAUSE]

00:21:33.630 --> 00:21:35.410
I mean, you know, there it is.

00:21:35.410 --> 00:21:37.780
Street light is far
away, but I found it.

00:21:37.780 --> 00:21:42.700
And so that really probably
impressed the hell out of her,

00:21:42.700 --> 00:21:43.550
I must say.

00:21:43.550 --> 00:21:46.032
So that's the story of that.

00:21:46.032 --> 00:21:47.740
VINOD MARUR: That is
an incredible story.

00:21:47.740 --> 00:21:49.641
Do you all ever
perform together?

00:21:49.641 --> 00:21:51.890
ZAKIR HUSSAIN: We have
performed quite a lot together.

00:21:51.890 --> 00:21:55.380
We just recently played
at the Kennedy Center

00:21:55.380 --> 00:21:57.460
with my Masters of
Percussion and Princeton.

00:22:00.510 --> 00:22:07.100
And we played in India just
last year and earlier this year.

00:22:07.100 --> 00:22:09.250
Feb?

00:22:09.250 --> 00:22:13.400
I mean, so we played in India,
and she danced last year

00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:16.140
with me at Prithvi Theatre.

00:22:16.140 --> 00:22:17.800
So that happens.

00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:20.596
And I've also performed
with my daughter here.

00:22:20.596 --> 00:22:22.220
VINOD MARUR: You
preempted my question.

00:22:22.220 --> 00:22:24.550
ZAKIR HUSSAIN: She's
a ballet teacher

00:22:24.550 --> 00:22:28.560
and this morning taught a
Bollywood class, Bollywood

00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:31.640
dance class-- wow-- and
salsa and all that stuff.

00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:34.260
So we've performed
together as family

00:22:34.260 --> 00:22:39.120
in Queen Elizabeth Hall in
London and out here in Marin

00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:40.530
and places.

00:22:40.530 --> 00:22:42.850
So yeah, we work together.

00:22:42.850 --> 00:22:44.700
My older daughter--
oh, by the way,

00:22:44.700 --> 00:22:46.285
I'm now a certified grandfather.

00:22:46.285 --> 00:22:47.660
VINOD MARUR: Oh,
congratulations.

00:22:47.660 --> 00:22:52.020
[APPLAUSE]

00:22:52.020 --> 00:22:56.830
ZAKIR HUSSAIN: Yes, I'm
trying four times as hard

00:22:56.830 --> 00:22:57.560
to look young.

00:22:57.560 --> 00:22:59.650
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:59.650 --> 00:23:02.299
It's like, no, you
have-- whatever.

00:23:02.299 --> 00:23:04.090
VINOD MARUR: You're
succeeding brilliantly,

00:23:04.090 --> 00:23:05.210
let me just tell you.

00:23:05.210 --> 00:23:06.610
ZAKIR HUSSAIN: I mean,
it's a good paying job.

00:23:06.610 --> 00:23:07.160
It works.

00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:08.930
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:08.930 --> 00:23:11.720
So, yeah, my older
daughter has just

00:23:11.720 --> 00:23:15.970
had a baby, about almost
11 months old in a few days

00:23:15.970 --> 00:23:18.760
and who walked at nine
and a half months.

00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:21.610
And so she's a filmmaker.

00:23:21.610 --> 00:23:28.650
She has produced five or four
feature-length feature films

00:23:28.650 --> 00:23:31.180
with [INAUDIBLE] and
various other people

00:23:31.180 --> 00:23:34.740
and with Heather
Graham and James Franco

00:23:34.740 --> 00:23:36.670
and all those guys and stuff.

00:23:36.670 --> 00:23:43.180
And her husband was
first assistant director

00:23:43.180 --> 00:23:46.150
for this show called "Scorpion."

00:23:46.150 --> 00:23:50.110
OK, and so everybody is in art.

00:23:50.110 --> 00:23:53.810
I'm very happy
that the family has

00:23:53.810 --> 00:23:56.270
stuck to doing
something creative,

00:23:56.270 --> 00:23:59.723
like people at "Googlay" do.

00:23:59.723 --> 00:24:02.644
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:02.644 --> 00:24:04.060
VINOD MARUR: So
the next question,

00:24:04.060 --> 00:24:07.690
actually, we're going
to turn to the video.

00:24:07.690 --> 00:24:11.630
This is from Shruti Shikanta,
and she has a question

00:24:11.630 --> 00:24:13.110
I think about collaboration.

00:24:13.110 --> 00:24:14.844
Can we just roll
the video, please?

00:24:14.844 --> 00:24:15.650
SPEAKER 2: Hi.

00:24:15.650 --> 00:24:16.670
I'm Shruti.

00:24:16.670 --> 00:24:20.080
I work in the Chrome team
here at Google Mountain View.

00:24:20.080 --> 00:24:22.455
Thank you so much for coming
here to speak with us today.

00:24:22.455 --> 00:24:23.580
ZAKIR HUSSAIN: My pleasure.

00:24:23.580 --> 00:24:25.570
ZAKIR HUSSAIN: I am
a huge fan, and I've

00:24:25.570 --> 00:24:27.350
been to many of your concerts.

00:24:27.350 --> 00:24:30.010
I especially love that
you play with musicians

00:24:30.010 --> 00:24:31.790
from different
parts of the world.

00:24:31.790 --> 00:24:34.230
So my question to you
is about collaborating

00:24:34.230 --> 00:24:37.570
with musicians who practice
different styles of music

00:24:37.570 --> 00:24:38.450
than you.

00:24:38.450 --> 00:24:41.910
Do you believe that they
have to share a common vision

00:24:41.910 --> 00:24:44.350
about the music that you
would like to create together?

00:24:44.350 --> 00:24:47.560
Or do you think that given
enough time and mutual respect,

00:24:47.560 --> 00:24:50.360
any two musicians
can create music

00:24:50.360 --> 00:24:52.300
that they both like and enjoy?

00:24:52.300 --> 00:24:54.500
Thank you very much.

00:24:54.500 --> 00:24:57.800
ZAKIR HUSSAIN: OK,
well, there are

00:24:57.800 --> 00:25:02.420
many occasions where musicians
are asked to come together, OK,

00:25:02.420 --> 00:25:07.660
Mr Herbie Hancock, Mr. Chick
Corea, come and play together

00:25:07.660 --> 00:25:13.670
or Shankar Mahadevan
and Shiva Mani

00:25:13.670 --> 00:25:16.940
and Zakir Hussain all
come together and play.

00:25:16.940 --> 00:25:20.670
So those are professional
concerts where you are paid,

00:25:20.670 --> 00:25:23.060
you come, and you play.

00:25:23.060 --> 00:25:26.890
And that can work quite well.

00:25:26.890 --> 00:25:31.620
But I feel up to
a certain extent

00:25:31.620 --> 00:25:37.590
the music that we play has a
lot to do with spontaneity,

00:25:37.590 --> 00:25:41.210
has a lot to do with
instant understanding

00:25:41.210 --> 00:25:43.035
and on-the-fly decision-making.

00:25:45.750 --> 00:25:51.190
For that, you have to know each
other very well on all levels.

00:25:51.190 --> 00:25:53.840
You have to know
the person, what

00:25:53.840 --> 00:25:58.250
his or her dislikes and
likes are in terms of food

00:25:58.250 --> 00:26:02.820
or films or politics or
anything, fashion or whatever,

00:26:02.820 --> 00:26:06.310
apart from that, what
his or her family is like

00:26:06.310 --> 00:26:09.910
and how they relate to music.

00:26:09.910 --> 00:26:16.320
And so I have found over the
years is that I've worked with

00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:20.190
many, many musicians, whether
it's John McLaughlin or Mickey

00:26:20.190 --> 00:26:26.520
Hart or Giovani Hidalgo or
[INAUDIBLE], [INAUDIBLE],

00:26:26.520 --> 00:26:28.710
Shankar Mahadevan, [INAUDIBLE].

00:26:28.710 --> 00:26:32.440
I mean, so many others.

00:26:32.440 --> 00:26:34.490
Some of them, I
have [INAUDIBLE].

00:26:34.490 --> 00:26:36.990
Like I worked with
somebody call Yo-Yo Ma.

00:26:36.990 --> 00:26:38.330
Have you heard of Yo-Yo Ma?

00:26:38.330 --> 00:26:43.160
I was commissioned to write
a piece for him, a bass

00:26:43.160 --> 00:26:45.620
player, a piano
player, and myself

00:26:45.620 --> 00:26:50.190
to play as music to be
choreographed for a dance

00:26:50.190 --> 00:26:56.480
ballet by Mark Morris, a
contemporary ballet composer.

00:26:56.480 --> 00:26:59.100
And so I did.

00:26:59.100 --> 00:27:02.440
But what's interesting
is that that happened,

00:27:02.440 --> 00:27:05.900
and it has not happened again.

00:27:05.900 --> 00:27:08.490
And there may be many reasons.

00:27:08.490 --> 00:27:09.800
I mean, we know each other.

00:27:09.800 --> 00:27:12.880
We still socially
say hello and stuff.

00:27:12.880 --> 00:27:19.820
But that kind of understanding
of knowing each other

00:27:19.820 --> 00:27:23.290
on all layers was
not established

00:27:23.290 --> 00:27:27.460
like it has with, say, banjo
player Bela Fleck or Edgar

00:27:27.460 --> 00:27:31.660
Meyer or John McLaughlin
or Mickey Hart, where we

00:27:31.660 --> 00:27:34.050
know each other inside and out.

00:27:34.050 --> 00:27:36.960
Our families know each
other inside and out.

00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:38.740
We hang out together.

00:27:38.740 --> 00:27:41.670
We exchange recipes together.

00:27:41.670 --> 00:27:44.630
Edgar Meyer calls up and says,
I want to make salmon curry.

00:27:44.630 --> 00:27:46.180
What do I do?

00:27:46.180 --> 00:27:47.666
How much ginger should I have?

00:27:47.666 --> 00:27:49.040
And then I arrive
in his kitchen,

00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:50.456
and there's like
this much ginger.

00:27:53.190 --> 00:27:56.150
And he said, is this enough?

00:27:56.150 --> 00:27:59.580
But anyway, so the thing
is, that is very important.

00:27:59.580 --> 00:28:03.400
Because when you get
on stage, you converse.

00:28:06.170 --> 00:28:09.850
Music, especially
improvised form with music,

00:28:09.850 --> 00:28:13.610
I believe should be spoken like
you speak in English or Hindi

00:28:13.610 --> 00:28:15.920
or French or Italian.

00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:17.290
So it's a language.

00:28:17.290 --> 00:28:22.800
If you can form words,
sentences, paragraphs, whatever

00:28:22.800 --> 00:28:25.700
and tell a story
in that language,

00:28:25.700 --> 00:28:27.510
you are actually improvising.

00:28:27.510 --> 00:28:30.590
Like right now, I'm
improvising in English,

00:28:30.590 --> 00:28:32.690
which is not my first language.

00:28:32.690 --> 00:28:34.980
I did not grow up
learning English.

00:28:34.980 --> 00:28:38.630
So when I finally
came across English,

00:28:38.630 --> 00:28:43.950
I had to master it to a point
where I could improvise in it,

00:28:43.950 --> 00:28:48.050
I could think in it
and spontaneously

00:28:48.050 --> 00:28:50.200
communicate with it.

00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:54.250
So if you can do
that with the music,

00:28:54.250 --> 00:28:58.550
you actually learn how to
improvise, how to be creative.

00:28:58.550 --> 00:28:59.550
That's important.

00:28:59.550 --> 00:29:03.920
So when you're playing with
musicians, that's what you do.

00:29:03.920 --> 00:29:07.450
If I'm playing with
Shankar Mahadevan,

00:29:07.450 --> 00:29:09.900
there would be a look
exchanged, and we'll

00:29:09.900 --> 00:29:12.181
know where we are going next.

00:29:12.181 --> 00:29:13.680
If I'm playing with
John McLaughlin,

00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:15.690
there will be a phrase
played, and I'll

00:29:15.690 --> 00:29:22.590
know a chain of phrases that
we will probably hop across

00:29:22.590 --> 00:29:25.680
and so can anticipate.

00:29:25.680 --> 00:29:27.590
Because he's not just playing.

00:29:27.590 --> 00:29:30.190
He's speaking to me.

00:29:30.190 --> 00:29:32.970
So if he's playing
a melodic line,

00:29:32.970 --> 00:29:37.800
he's asking me, how about
going here when we're playing?

00:29:37.800 --> 00:29:41.190
And I'm replaying,
saying, yeah, why not?

00:29:41.190 --> 00:29:43.920
And that has to happen.

00:29:43.920 --> 00:29:49.560
So that intimacy with each other
on all level accomplishes that.

00:29:49.560 --> 00:29:51.240
So that's very
important when you're

00:29:51.240 --> 00:29:54.480
coming into a situation
of playing with musicians

00:29:54.480 --> 00:29:58.170
of different genres of
music, even musicians

00:29:58.170 --> 00:29:59.310
of Indian classical music.

00:29:59.310 --> 00:30:03.850
For instance, one of the pieces
that I did before my symphony

00:30:03.850 --> 00:30:06.680
orchestra in London was
with the sitar player,

00:30:06.680 --> 00:30:08.900
[INAUDIBLE] Niladri Kumar.

00:30:08.900 --> 00:30:10.990
We did a duet.

00:30:10.990 --> 00:30:15.180
But we just got on stage, we did
a sound check, and we played.

00:30:15.180 --> 00:30:17.630
We never talked about
what we were going to do.

00:30:17.630 --> 00:30:19.340
But what happens is this.

00:30:19.340 --> 00:30:21.200
You're sitting in
the dressing room,

00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:22.605
and you're talking
about cricket,

00:30:22.605 --> 00:30:24.115
or you're talking
about the weather,

00:30:24.115 --> 00:30:27.020
or you're talking
about politics,

00:30:27.020 --> 00:30:30.770
saying all sorts of things--
Trump, do you believe?

00:30:30.770 --> 00:30:35.530
Or you say all sorts of
funny things to each other.

00:30:35.530 --> 00:30:39.790
And so you kind of are
gauging each other's mood

00:30:39.790 --> 00:30:45.740
at that moment, where one's
mind is at that point.

00:30:45.740 --> 00:30:48.240
And you're talking, and
you're walking onto the stage

00:30:48.240 --> 00:30:50.040
while they are announcing you.

00:30:50.040 --> 00:30:54.290
And then you get on stage
and you start playing.

00:30:54.290 --> 00:31:01.010
But without you knowing, that
talk is now on the instruments.

00:31:01.010 --> 00:31:04.470
And you're speaking,
continuing to speak, as you do.

00:31:04.470 --> 00:31:06.620
When you go to a
concert, sometimes

00:31:06.620 --> 00:31:08.830
find a way into
the dressing room

00:31:08.830 --> 00:31:11.150
and see the musicians
sitting there.

00:31:11.150 --> 00:31:13.410
They are talking
about everything else

00:31:13.410 --> 00:31:15.760
in the world except music.

00:31:15.760 --> 00:31:20.190
Yeah, [INAUDIBLE] and
anything about-- I

00:31:20.190 --> 00:31:22.470
mean, did you hear
what that person said?

00:31:22.470 --> 00:31:23.960
Did you know this happened?

00:31:23.960 --> 00:31:27.750
And what kind of a car I want
to buy and all that stuff.

00:31:27.750 --> 00:31:30.910
Nothing about what
should we be playing,

00:31:30.910 --> 00:31:33.820
can you tell me the melody,
or what rhythm-- nothing.

00:31:33.820 --> 00:31:36.940
And then you go on stage, and
the conversation continues.

00:31:36.940 --> 00:31:37.990
So it's important.

00:31:37.990 --> 00:31:40.260
It doesn't matter
whether you're playing

00:31:40.260 --> 00:31:43.170
with the musicians of
same tradition of music

00:31:43.170 --> 00:31:46.260
that you are from
or other traditions.

00:31:46.260 --> 00:31:50.410
You must intimately
know them well to really

00:31:50.410 --> 00:31:56.000
on all levels interact
and play music, which has

00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:59.040
a spark of spontaneity in it.

00:31:59.040 --> 00:32:01.960
Otherwise, you can just
accept a professional gig,

00:32:01.960 --> 00:32:06.660
take a fat check, and just
get together, put together

00:32:06.660 --> 00:32:09.479
a couple of pieces, and get on
stage and play it and go away.

00:32:09.479 --> 00:32:10.312
VINOD MARUR: Got it.

00:32:10.312 --> 00:32:12.200
Cool.

00:32:12.200 --> 00:32:13.710
You mentioned you cook.

00:32:13.710 --> 00:32:15.090
ZAKIR HUSSAIN: Oh, yeah.

00:32:15.090 --> 00:32:17.409
VINOD MARUR: Any
favorite dishes?

00:32:17.409 --> 00:32:19.200
ZAKIR HUSSAIN: Anything
I cook is favorite.

00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:20.325
What are you talking about?

00:32:20.325 --> 00:32:21.470
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:21.470 --> 00:32:23.490
No, I mean I make good keema.

00:32:23.490 --> 00:32:28.420
I make chicken curry, different
styles of chicken curry.

00:32:28.420 --> 00:32:32.510
I do eggs not bad.

00:32:32.510 --> 00:32:36.050
And so when my daughters
want some Indian,

00:32:36.050 --> 00:32:41.470
they just, hey, Dad, cook up
some chicken curry, will you?

00:32:41.470 --> 00:32:42.710
That happens.

00:32:42.710 --> 00:32:43.860
And so I cook.

00:32:43.860 --> 00:32:48.030
And all musicians are foodies.

00:32:48.030 --> 00:32:48.630
Yeah.

00:32:48.630 --> 00:32:51.420
When they come to the
concert hall, the first thing

00:32:51.420 --> 00:32:54.000
they say to each other, where
are we going for dinner?

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:55.640
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:55.640 --> 00:32:57.292
Concert hasn't
even happened yet.

00:32:57.292 --> 00:32:58.470
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:58.470 --> 00:33:01.146
We haven't even opened
our instruments.

00:33:01.146 --> 00:33:03.270
We haven't tuned or anything
or done a sound check.

00:33:03.270 --> 00:33:05.730
The first question is, where
are we going for dinner?

00:33:05.730 --> 00:33:07.880
It's very important.

00:33:07.880 --> 00:33:12.140
I mean, that kind
of expecting allows

00:33:12.140 --> 00:33:15.430
you to get excited about the
journey of getting there.

00:33:15.430 --> 00:33:17.806
And that part of the
journey is playing the music

00:33:17.806 --> 00:33:18.930
and getting that over with.

00:33:18.930 --> 00:33:24.270
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:24.270 --> 00:33:27.510
VINOD MARUR: Switching
gears a bit, here at Google,

00:33:27.510 --> 00:33:30.210
hard to avoid the
topic of technology.

00:33:30.210 --> 00:33:32.030
What's your sense
about technology,

00:33:32.030 --> 00:33:36.340
how it's affected you, how
you think it's affected music?

00:33:36.340 --> 00:33:39.340
ZAKIR HUSSAIN: Well,
technology has actually

00:33:39.340 --> 00:33:43.360
broadened the way
we think about music

00:33:43.360 --> 00:33:44.725
and we approach our instruments.

00:33:47.710 --> 00:33:51.030
Why, even present
technology-- go back

00:33:51.030 --> 00:33:56.660
85, 90 years to
the sound system,

00:33:56.660 --> 00:33:59.630
the amplification arriving.

00:33:59.630 --> 00:34:04.400
And that was really a
big, landmark happening.

00:34:04.400 --> 00:34:09.630
It really did a lot
to change the way

00:34:09.630 --> 00:34:12.340
we perform music in India.

00:34:12.340 --> 00:34:14.690
And I think it's the same
for music performed anywhere

00:34:14.690 --> 00:34:15.989
in the world.

00:34:15.989 --> 00:34:19.010
I mean, would we have
had stadium concerts

00:34:19.010 --> 00:34:20.750
if there was no sound system?

00:34:20.750 --> 00:34:22.900
No.

00:34:22.900 --> 00:34:23.760
Not at all.

00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:26.760
And would we have had
electric guitars and bass

00:34:26.760 --> 00:34:30.830
guitars and stuff if
there was no sound system?

00:34:30.830 --> 00:34:31.770
No.

00:34:31.770 --> 00:34:34.659
So, I mean, music
has obviously started

00:34:34.659 --> 00:34:39.199
changing from the time when
the sound system arrived.

00:34:39.199 --> 00:34:44.290
Personally speaking
for me, I started

00:34:44.290 --> 00:34:52.989
to discover semitones,
frequencies, microtones,

00:34:52.989 --> 00:34:58.410
resonance, harmonics
in my instrument

00:34:58.410 --> 00:35:01.890
after the mic got put on it.

00:35:01.890 --> 00:35:08.920
And so suddenly, something
which was like pom is now pumm.

00:35:08.920 --> 00:35:13.490
And something that was
boom is now boommm.

00:35:13.490 --> 00:35:18.320
So now suddenly from the
boommm, you can go booommm.

00:35:18.320 --> 00:35:23.660
You can do that, which was
not possible that long ago,

00:35:23.660 --> 00:35:24.660
100 years ago.

00:35:24.660 --> 00:35:29.270
They played music differently--
very hard, very percussive.

00:35:29.270 --> 00:35:31.640
Even the sitar and
the sarod [INAUDIBLE]

00:35:31.640 --> 00:35:33.630
was played very
percussive if you listen

00:35:33.630 --> 00:35:35.970
to a recording 70 years old.

00:35:35.970 --> 00:35:39.690
And something you will notice
is that the change is obvious

00:35:39.690 --> 00:35:40.590
how it is.

00:35:40.590 --> 00:35:44.870
So for me, having
discovered the sound system

00:35:44.870 --> 00:35:47.670
and the frequencies,
I mean, you also

00:35:47.670 --> 00:35:52.530
have to know what frequencies
does the tabla project

00:35:52.530 --> 00:35:56.070
and then how to find
in the sound system

00:35:56.070 --> 00:35:58.900
graphic equalizer,
those frequencies,

00:35:58.900 --> 00:36:00.980
and highlight them.

00:36:00.980 --> 00:36:04.320
So you've got to learn to
recognize all that stuff.

00:36:04.320 --> 00:36:06.520
And then once you
highlight them,

00:36:06.520 --> 00:36:10.400
then you don't have to now bang.

00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:13.110
You don't have to
wallop the instrument.

00:36:13.110 --> 00:36:18.050
You can just play nice and
easy, subtle, too strong,

00:36:18.050 --> 00:36:21.240
whatever you want to do,
and be able to manipulate

00:36:21.240 --> 00:36:25.960
the instrument not just
rhythmically, but melodically.

00:36:25.960 --> 00:36:28.160
And that's what's
happened with the tabla.

00:36:28.160 --> 00:36:30.900
Tabla has now become an
instrument that is not

00:36:30.900 --> 00:36:32.180
just rhythmic instrument.

00:36:32.180 --> 00:36:34.800
It's a melodic
instrument as well.

00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:38.320
And that's invention
of the sound system.

00:36:38.320 --> 00:36:42.880
And then once you've got the
sound system, sky's the limit.

00:36:42.880 --> 00:36:46.830
You can now start putting
Ableton Live on it,

00:36:46.830 --> 00:36:49.170
and you can start
processing the sound.

00:36:49.170 --> 00:36:53.200
You can start putting delays
and whatnot and everything.

00:36:53.200 --> 00:36:56.404
The question is, how
far do you go with it?

00:36:56.404 --> 00:36:58.940
And that's very important.

00:36:58.940 --> 00:37:01.680
I know some friends of
mine who are tabla players,

00:37:01.680 --> 00:37:04.300
like [INAUDIBLE] or
Talvin Singh and all,

00:37:04.300 --> 00:37:07.270
they have electrified
the tablas.

00:37:07.270 --> 00:37:11.960
They have put electronic
pickups into the instrument.

00:37:11.960 --> 00:37:16.370
And they put a cable
under the tabla.

00:37:16.370 --> 00:37:19.470
And they put it through
all these electronic sounds

00:37:19.470 --> 00:37:21.430
and machines.

00:37:21.430 --> 00:37:27.440
And that gives them a whole
range of electronic tones,

00:37:27.440 --> 00:37:30.110
synthetic tones, to work with.

00:37:30.110 --> 00:37:37.970
So, I mean, you can be in some
ways pulled in by that so much

00:37:37.970 --> 00:37:40.740
so that you actually forget what
the real instrument actually

00:37:40.740 --> 00:37:42.440
is.

00:37:42.440 --> 00:37:45.440
So I mean, unlike those
gentlemen who have done that

00:37:45.440 --> 00:37:49.090
and have really taken the
tabla into a whole new genre

00:37:49.090 --> 00:37:51.900
of music, which is drum and
bass and [? Asian ?] underground

00:37:51.900 --> 00:37:55.170
and et cetera, et cetera,
and that's a great place,

00:37:55.170 --> 00:37:59.360
I have resisted the
urge of doing that.

00:37:59.360 --> 00:38:04.580
I still play my acoustic tablas
and-- through a microphone,

00:38:04.580 --> 00:38:07.170
of course-- and deal with
the natural tone that

00:38:07.170 --> 00:38:09.160
comes out of that instrument.

00:38:09.160 --> 00:38:15.170
If I want to do electronical
messing with it,

00:38:15.170 --> 00:38:20.500
I have found a system whereby
I have this gear going

00:38:20.500 --> 00:38:23.480
through a computer,
where my microphones go

00:38:23.480 --> 00:38:25.840
through a sound card
into that computer

00:38:25.840 --> 00:38:29.120
so my instrument is not
electronically plugged in.

00:38:29.120 --> 00:38:31.650
That is still acoustic.

00:38:31.650 --> 00:38:34.290
So I have a choice
of hitting a button

00:38:34.290 --> 00:38:39.080
and suddenly turning my
tabla into AI, Artificial

00:38:39.080 --> 00:38:43.120
Intelligence, or turning
it off and just playing

00:38:43.120 --> 00:38:44.350
a regular tabla.

00:38:44.350 --> 00:38:51.320
And so that has allowed me
really a lot of leeway and kind

00:38:51.320 --> 00:38:55.440
of a gateway into playing with
a whole different area of music

00:38:55.440 --> 00:38:56.990
and musicians.

00:38:56.990 --> 00:39:01.240
And right now it's under
repairs, my system,

00:39:01.240 --> 00:39:03.860
and they are rebooting it
and upgrading it and so on.

00:39:03.860 --> 00:39:07.700
Once it's done, I'm hoping
to use it again and play

00:39:07.700 --> 00:39:09.110
for composing and stuff.

00:39:09.110 --> 00:39:13.320
I mean, that's what most of the
musicians in India are doing,

00:39:13.320 --> 00:39:14.210
film music.

00:39:14.210 --> 00:39:18.640
They now use a lot
of electronic stuff

00:39:18.640 --> 00:39:21.200
to be able to write
music and compose music

00:39:21.200 --> 00:39:25.496
and work at GarageBand is
one of those kind of things,

00:39:25.496 --> 00:39:29.420
a very simple tool.

00:39:29.420 --> 00:39:34.510
So technology has most
certainly given us

00:39:34.510 --> 00:39:37.490
a whole different
insight into music.

00:39:37.490 --> 00:39:44.430
But the danger, obviously,
is that we tend to pile it on

00:39:44.430 --> 00:39:49.700
so much so that the actual
character of the music

00:39:49.700 --> 00:39:53.680
that we play, the instruments
that we represent,

00:39:53.680 --> 00:39:58.750
kind of take the backseat, and
so a balance has to be found.

00:39:58.750 --> 00:40:01.270
VINOD MARUR: Understood.

00:40:01.270 --> 00:40:05.020
Do you use YouTube yourself
as a distribution mechanism?

00:40:05.020 --> 00:40:07.180
What are your thoughts
on YouTube in terms

00:40:07.180 --> 00:40:08.710
of increasing the reach?

00:40:08.710 --> 00:40:10.710
ZAKIR HUSSAIN: Well, first
of all, I'm not tube.

00:40:10.710 --> 00:40:13.320
VINOD MARUR: OK.

00:40:13.320 --> 00:40:14.020
Got it.

00:40:14.020 --> 00:40:14.850
Us [? tube. ?]

00:40:14.850 --> 00:40:16.600
ZAKIR HUSSAIN: That
went like that, right?

00:40:16.600 --> 00:40:17.270
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:17.270 --> 00:40:17.770
YouTube?

00:40:17.770 --> 00:40:18.540
VINOD MARUR: I got it.

00:40:18.540 --> 00:40:20.456
ZAKIR HUSSAIN: If look
at you and say YouTube,

00:40:20.456 --> 00:40:22.024
you will have to say, no.

00:40:22.024 --> 00:40:24.980
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:24.980 --> 00:40:28.220
So YouTube, yes.

00:40:28.220 --> 00:40:30.850
So YouTube is a great tool.

00:40:30.850 --> 00:40:31.590
It's amazing.

00:40:31.590 --> 00:40:36.290
I mean, again, there
are discussions

00:40:36.290 --> 00:40:43.370
about whether the artists are
getting the benefit of that

00:40:43.370 --> 00:40:48.540
or in terms of economics, the
financial benefits out of it.

00:40:48.540 --> 00:40:51.420
Most of the artists are not, OK?

00:40:51.420 --> 00:40:53.380
I mean, the other
day we were looking

00:40:53.380 --> 00:40:55.000
at YouTube or
something, and there

00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:58.430
was some of my videos,
which had like 600,000

00:40:58.430 --> 00:41:01.380
or some sort of viewership.

00:41:01.380 --> 00:41:04.220
And apparently, there
is a way to go about it

00:41:04.220 --> 00:41:07.320
and be part of it where
royalties come in for that.

00:41:07.320 --> 00:41:09.560
But you have to
go to use so much

00:41:09.560 --> 00:41:14.290
rigmarole to be able to
do that that it's almost

00:41:14.290 --> 00:41:18.370
like you throw up your
hands and say, forget it.

00:41:18.370 --> 00:41:22.280
But YouTube is a great tool
to get music out there,

00:41:22.280 --> 00:41:26.320
to get information out there to
people about what you're doing

00:41:26.320 --> 00:41:28.580
and where to come
and see you and where

00:41:28.580 --> 00:41:31.092
to buy tickets and all
that stuff and everything.

00:41:31.092 --> 00:41:32.800
Tweet is another one,
and all that stuff.

00:41:32.800 --> 00:41:39.950
But YouTube gives you a chance
to be able to showcase whatever

00:41:39.950 --> 00:41:42.990
it is that you're going to
be doing, say, in a concert

00:41:42.990 --> 00:41:46.360
or on a concept tour and so
on, so that people can actually

00:41:46.360 --> 00:41:50.920
get some kind of a trailer of
it and be a little bit more

00:41:50.920 --> 00:41:53.410
informed when they
come to see you.

00:41:53.410 --> 00:41:56.940
So in that sense,
YouTube is a great tool.

00:41:56.940 --> 00:42:00.630
For me, it's been great
to be able to hear

00:42:00.630 --> 00:42:04.530
music of the old masters
that has been on YouTube.

00:42:04.530 --> 00:42:08.500
And it's like I wonder, where
did these people find this?

00:42:08.500 --> 00:42:11.710
I mean, there's a lot of
stuff, and I listen to it,

00:42:11.710 --> 00:42:17.130
and that's like gems
that I can learn from,

00:42:17.130 --> 00:42:20.460
that I can take information
from, glean information

00:42:20.460 --> 00:42:25.610
from, and just develop my
repertoire further and further.

00:42:25.610 --> 00:42:29.970
So in that sense for me,
keeping traditional music

00:42:29.970 --> 00:42:35.280
in view and great masters
of that tradition from 1930s

00:42:35.280 --> 00:42:39.400
and '40s and '50s and
their presence on YouTube,

00:42:39.400 --> 00:42:41.650
it has become a
great learning tool.

00:42:41.650 --> 00:42:44.290
So I have to say
that in that sense,

00:42:44.290 --> 00:42:49.471
YouTube has more
positives than negatives.

00:42:49.471 --> 00:42:50.470
VINOD MARUR: Understood.

00:42:50.470 --> 00:42:51.261
ZAKIR HUSSAIN: Yes.

00:42:51.261 --> 00:42:53.410
But obviously, there's
always room for improvement.

00:42:53.410 --> 00:42:54.118
VINOD MARUR: Yes.

00:42:54.118 --> 00:42:55.890
ZAKIR HUSSAIN: But
musicians, I mean,

00:42:55.890 --> 00:43:01.260
whoever runs these
programs or stations should

00:43:01.260 --> 00:43:05.940
try to find a way to make it
possible for the musicians

00:43:05.940 --> 00:43:10.220
to prosper as well
from whatever it is.

00:43:10.220 --> 00:43:12.260
I mean, I'm not
saying that everyone

00:43:12.260 --> 00:43:14.670
is going to be looked
at on YouTube forever.

00:43:14.670 --> 00:43:16.410
I mean, you hear
of people who have

00:43:16.410 --> 00:43:19.010
had two million hits or eight
million hits or something,

00:43:19.010 --> 00:43:23.200
and they are making a decent
amount of money from that.

00:43:23.200 --> 00:43:24.860
But then there are
Indian musicians

00:43:24.860 --> 00:43:29.710
who really have no clue about
how to go about doing that,

00:43:29.710 --> 00:43:33.130
and they just are not
benefiting at all from it.

00:43:33.130 --> 00:43:36.180
So whoever is running
YouTube should

00:43:36.180 --> 00:43:41.500
find a way to be able to be
a little bit more concerned

00:43:41.500 --> 00:43:49.530
as a YouTube helm person
about less fortunate musicians

00:43:49.530 --> 00:43:54.110
who need the help to be
able to keep delivering.

00:43:54.110 --> 00:43:59.450
VINOD MARUR: [INAUDIBLE] I'm
going to skip the next video

00:43:59.450 --> 00:44:01.190
question.

00:44:01.190 --> 00:44:05.190
But roughly, it ties into the
follow-up up question which I

00:44:05.190 --> 00:44:08.200
have for you, which is,
if you look around--

00:44:08.200 --> 00:44:09.880
ZAKIR HUSSAIN: I'm
glad you told me.

00:44:09.880 --> 00:44:11.660
VINOD MARUR: No,
the reason is I know

00:44:11.660 --> 00:44:13.880
they've been eagerly
awaiting this particular one.

00:44:13.880 --> 00:44:17.780
But when you look at
the younger generation,

00:44:17.780 --> 00:44:20.140
there's a sentiment--
whether it's true or not

00:44:20.140 --> 00:44:21.560
is one question I have for you.

00:44:21.560 --> 00:44:24.480
But presuming it's
true, the trend

00:44:24.480 --> 00:44:28.150
seems to be more towards
fusion and away from, I'll say,

00:44:28.150 --> 00:44:31.354
pure classical music.

00:44:31.354 --> 00:44:33.020
First of all, do you
think there is just

00:44:33.020 --> 00:44:37.790
an artificial sentiment, or is
it something real you perceive?

00:44:37.790 --> 00:44:44.460
ZAKIR HUSSAIN: Well,
I feel that there

00:44:44.460 --> 00:44:55.860
is an equal amount of interest
in modern elements of fusion

00:44:55.860 --> 00:44:58.750
and the ancient
elements of fusion.

00:44:58.750 --> 00:45:02.150
And I'm using the word
"fusion" for ancient elements.

00:45:02.150 --> 00:45:04.810
Think about it.

00:45:04.810 --> 00:45:09.220
1,000 years ago in
India there existed

00:45:09.220 --> 00:45:11.200
a music called [INAUDIBLE].

00:45:19.610 --> 00:45:23.330
These were ancient forms
of music, which were

00:45:23.330 --> 00:45:26.010
played in the temples a lot.

00:45:28.660 --> 00:45:32.710
Then came the
Muslims into India.

00:45:32.710 --> 00:45:39.970
And they brought this very
learned Turkish Sufi gentleman

00:45:39.970 --> 00:45:43.690
called Amir Khusrow to India.

00:45:43.690 --> 00:45:53.580
Amir Khusrow was a
master of Qual Qalbana.

00:45:53.580 --> 00:45:58.320
These were Sufi forms of
music now popularly known

00:45:58.320 --> 00:46:03.320
as qawali-- Qual Qalbana,
now known as Qawwali.

00:46:05.960 --> 00:46:11.050
I should pause here and
say Qawwali is actually

00:46:11.050 --> 00:46:17.640
the only seed Sufi
form of music.

00:46:17.640 --> 00:46:21.210
Everything else is a copycat.

00:46:21.210 --> 00:46:23.790
Remember that.

00:46:23.790 --> 00:46:28.110
Amir Khusrow was really
one of those person who

00:46:28.110 --> 00:46:31.460
believes in
universality, humanity

00:46:31.460 --> 00:46:37.380
as being one, religious
elements not being the divider.

00:46:37.380 --> 00:46:42.530
He was really taken by
[INAUDIBLE], [INAUDIBLE],

00:46:42.530 --> 00:46:46.390
and dhrupad singing in
the temples of India.

00:46:46.390 --> 00:46:50.670
And he took elements of
those and combined it

00:46:50.670 --> 00:46:54.510
with the Sufi Qual
and Qalbana music.

00:46:54.510 --> 00:46:57.370
And he came up with
a form of music,

00:46:57.370 --> 00:47:04.390
which eventually got known as
or became popular as Khyal.

00:47:04.390 --> 00:47:10.190
Khyal is the premier North
Indian classical form of music

00:47:10.190 --> 00:47:16.260
that anybody from [INAUDIBLE]
or [INAUDIBLE] or [INAUDIBLE]

00:47:16.260 --> 00:47:20.770
or Ravi Shankarji or
[INAUDIBLE], everybody

00:47:20.770 --> 00:47:23.290
plays-- Khyal.

00:47:23.290 --> 00:47:28.380
So fusion already took place
then, already was in place.

00:47:28.380 --> 00:47:29.740
Now imagine this.

00:47:29.740 --> 00:47:35.660
In its seed form, it had its
dos and don't and what to do.

00:47:35.660 --> 00:47:40.910
But over the years, other
elements came into play.

00:47:40.910 --> 00:47:44.690
Musicians moved to different
parts of the country.

00:47:44.690 --> 00:47:47.890
And then they were influenced by
the folk music of that country,

00:47:47.890 --> 00:47:50.100
of that state or that region.

00:47:50.100 --> 00:47:52.770
And that fusion took place.

00:47:52.770 --> 00:47:59.180
And suddenly you started hearing
pahari in classical music

00:47:59.180 --> 00:48:01.990
or you started hearing
kajari or [INAUDIBLE]

00:48:01.990 --> 00:48:05.190
or [INAUDIBLE] or [INAUDIBLE]
into classical music.

00:48:05.190 --> 00:48:07.990
And all this fusion
started to take place.

00:48:07.990 --> 00:48:12.770
So fusion is not something
that is like today.

00:48:12.770 --> 00:48:14.960
It has been going on forever.

00:48:14.960 --> 00:48:16.850
So it's not a new thing.

00:48:16.850 --> 00:48:22.280
So all Indian students of
Indian classical music tradition

00:48:22.280 --> 00:48:26.350
in India are already
sitting on something that

00:48:26.350 --> 00:48:33.170
is a hybrid, a mutated form.

00:48:33.170 --> 00:48:35.420
And so they're playing that.

00:48:35.420 --> 00:48:37.882
Then came the sound
system that changed

00:48:37.882 --> 00:48:39.340
the way the
instruments are played,

00:48:39.340 --> 00:48:42.440
music is played--
another fusion.

00:48:42.440 --> 00:48:43.890
So that has happened.

00:48:43.890 --> 00:48:47.210
So what I'm trying
to say is that when

00:48:47.210 --> 00:48:50.880
you talk about fusion,
you have to understand

00:48:50.880 --> 00:48:54.160
that fusion is already in
Indian classical music.

00:48:54.160 --> 00:48:59.430
Fusion is also considered
the domain of something

00:48:59.430 --> 00:49:02.480
that requires drums
and bass and keyboards

00:49:02.480 --> 00:49:05.590
and whatnot-- no, not true.

00:49:05.590 --> 00:49:12.340
So in 1960s and stuff, I used
to hear Qawwali singers singing

00:49:12.340 --> 00:49:19.490
Qawwali, [INAUDIBLE] players,
tabla players, mandolins,

00:49:19.490 --> 00:49:24.870
banjos, all that stuff in
an amplifier or something.

00:49:24.870 --> 00:49:29.230
So even the Sufi music at
that point became fusion.

00:49:29.230 --> 00:49:30.560
So that happened.

00:49:30.560 --> 00:49:35.100
So my understanding of this,
keeping all this in mind,

00:49:35.100 --> 00:49:41.900
is that there is an equal
audience for traditional music

00:49:41.900 --> 00:49:44.440
and the way it's growing.

00:49:44.440 --> 00:49:45.670
It's still changing.

00:49:45.670 --> 00:49:47.650
It's still mutating.

00:49:47.650 --> 00:49:49.890
So that's what's
happening with it.

00:49:49.890 --> 00:49:54.120
And then there's the fusion
known as fusion world

00:49:54.120 --> 00:49:54.960
these days.

00:49:54.960 --> 00:50:00.140
Like for instance, I played with
[INAUDIBLE] in Civic San Jose.

00:50:00.140 --> 00:50:02.100
He sang [INAUDIBLE].

00:50:02.100 --> 00:50:04.570
[INAUDIBLE] is an old form.

00:50:04.570 --> 00:50:08.550
But he had a guitar player,
he had a keyboard player,

00:50:08.550 --> 00:50:12.670
he had me playing
tabla, and I also

00:50:12.670 --> 00:50:16.910
had some kind of a
drum set-up thing.

00:50:16.910 --> 00:50:18.700
So he's singing [INAUDIBLE].

00:50:18.700 --> 00:50:20.340
That is the form
that's going on.

00:50:20.340 --> 00:50:24.000
What you have done
is you've put more

00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:29.640
today's rhythmic and melodic,
harmonic ideas onto it.

00:50:29.640 --> 00:50:32.350
But the core
element is the same.

00:50:32.350 --> 00:50:35.790
So whether that is fusion
or not, I don't know.

00:50:35.790 --> 00:50:38.560
So the core element is the same.

00:50:38.560 --> 00:50:41.880
Where fusion
appeared in Bollywood

00:50:41.880 --> 00:50:49.520
was way back in 1940s when
music directors started using

00:50:49.520 --> 00:50:52.070
violins and cellos and whatnot.

00:50:52.070 --> 00:50:55.580
I remember playing recordings
for music composers

00:50:55.580 --> 00:51:00.320
like [INAUDIBLE] or [INAUDIBLE]
or [INAUDIBLE] or Shanker

00:51:00.320 --> 00:51:01.860
Jaikishan and so on.

00:51:01.860 --> 00:51:04.230
I grew up in that world.

00:51:04.230 --> 00:51:06.250
And we'd be in that room.

00:51:06.250 --> 00:51:11.730
Believe it or not, the room
was probably 10% of this size,

00:51:11.730 --> 00:51:14.120
just like one angle like this.

00:51:14.120 --> 00:51:19.730
And at one end, there were
two tables, tabla, dholak,

00:51:19.730 --> 00:51:23.930
and a couple of chairs,
[INAUDIBLE] wallah and shaker

00:51:23.930 --> 00:51:28.320
wallah -- ch-ch-ch-- that
stuff, and one microphone

00:51:28.320 --> 00:51:29.710
in the middle, OK?

00:51:29.710 --> 00:51:31.890
So if they wanted to hear
more of my bass drum,

00:51:31.890 --> 00:51:34.465
they'd say, move the bass
drum a little forward.

00:51:34.465 --> 00:51:35.830
[LAUGHTER]

00:51:35.830 --> 00:51:38.230
There wasn't adjustment
in the booth.

00:51:38.230 --> 00:51:40.450
You had to adjust it yourself.

00:51:40.450 --> 00:51:41.900
So that was the thing.

00:51:41.900 --> 00:51:45.720
Then just directly across from
me at the other end of the room

00:51:45.720 --> 00:51:50.680
were about 35, 40 chairs,
violins, violas, cellos.

00:51:50.680 --> 00:51:52.640
They were all laid out.

00:51:52.640 --> 00:51:56.670
On the left of
them were the bass.

00:51:56.670 --> 00:51:59.360
Left of the bass was the piano.

00:51:59.360 --> 00:52:02.860
On opposite side of the
piano was another microphone,

00:52:02.860 --> 00:52:05.420
and around that
microphone on tables

00:52:05.420 --> 00:52:09.020
raised sat cross-legged
[INAUDIBLE]

00:52:09.020 --> 00:52:13.840
on flute, Sultan Khan on
sarangi, Rais Khan on sitar.

00:52:13.840 --> 00:52:15.600
They all sat over there.

00:52:15.600 --> 00:52:19.920
And all of us-- and
including the horn players,

00:52:19.920 --> 00:52:23.180
who were between the [INAUDIBLE]
rhythm players and the violin,

00:52:23.180 --> 00:52:25.590
standing in the
center with saxophone,

00:52:25.590 --> 00:52:30.190
trumpet, trombone, all
that, they were there.

00:52:30.190 --> 00:52:35.360
And we are all playing for
a song sung in the booth

00:52:35.360 --> 00:52:38.870
by [INAUDIBLE] or
[INAUDIBLE] and so on.

00:52:38.870 --> 00:52:43.710
And in those days, you had
to play the song through.

00:52:43.710 --> 00:52:46.340
If somebody made a
mistake, you stop,

00:52:46.340 --> 00:52:48.760
and you did it all over again.

00:52:48.760 --> 00:52:52.880
These days, you can sing one
word, stop, sing two words,

00:52:52.880 --> 00:52:55.750
stop, sing a line, stop.

00:52:55.750 --> 00:52:59.600
And not just that--
sing one word 500 times,

00:52:59.600 --> 00:53:03.040
sing two words 1,000
times and so on

00:53:03.040 --> 00:53:05.270
and on and then pick the best.

00:53:05.270 --> 00:53:06.190
It wasn't like that.

00:53:06.190 --> 00:53:08.980
But that was also fusion.

00:53:08.980 --> 00:53:11.730
And so fusion started
way back then.

00:53:11.730 --> 00:53:14.180
And then RD Burman took
it to a different level.

00:53:14.180 --> 00:53:16.990
LP took it to a different level.

00:53:16.990 --> 00:53:19.580
Bappi Lahiri brought it
down to a different level.

00:53:19.580 --> 00:53:23.910
[LAUGHTER]

00:53:23.910 --> 00:53:25.560
And so on and on happened.

00:53:25.560 --> 00:53:30.980
But all I'm trying to say
is that you heard fusion

00:53:30.980 --> 00:53:32.830
in Madan Mohan's song.

00:53:32.830 --> 00:53:34.920
And they were some of
the most beautiful songs

00:53:34.920 --> 00:53:36.730
that you will ever hear.

00:53:36.730 --> 00:53:40.590
You heard some of the great old
songs of Laxmikant Pyarelal--

00:53:40.590 --> 00:53:42.720
fabulous.

00:53:42.720 --> 00:53:47.970
[NON-ENGLISH SINGING]

00:54:05.230 --> 00:54:07.625
One of the earlier songs
of LP-- I played it.

00:54:07.625 --> 00:54:11.770
[APPLAUSE]

00:54:11.770 --> 00:54:14.950
So these kind of songs
were already there.

00:54:14.950 --> 00:54:17.550
So fusion is good.

00:54:17.550 --> 00:54:19.190
Fusion is acceptable.

00:54:19.190 --> 00:54:22.320
Fusion is the next wave.

00:54:22.320 --> 00:54:24.560
And when you say
the next wave, it's

00:54:24.560 --> 00:54:26.790
not like for the
next six months.

00:54:26.790 --> 00:54:30.090
It's been there for the
last 15, 20, 30 years.

00:54:30.090 --> 00:54:34.810
And it will go on until somebody
finds another word-- refusion

00:54:34.810 --> 00:54:40.160
or defusion or C-fusion
or confusion or whatever.

00:54:40.160 --> 00:54:42.850
They'll find words
that will be different.

00:54:42.850 --> 00:54:47.120
When John McLaughlin and I
and L. Shankar on the violin

00:54:47.120 --> 00:54:50.040
and Vikku Vinayakram on the
ghatam got together and played

00:54:50.040 --> 00:54:52.940
a band called Shakti
and we recorded--

00:54:52.940 --> 00:54:54.710
[APPLAUSE]

00:54:54.710 --> 00:54:55.660
You can clap.

00:54:55.660 --> 00:54:56.220
It's OK.

00:54:56.220 --> 00:54:58.090
[LAUGHTER]

00:54:58.090 --> 00:55:01.070
I'll act properly demure and--

00:55:01.070 --> 00:55:02.200
[LAUGHTER]

00:55:02.200 --> 00:55:05.670
Anyway, so when we played
and the recording was made,

00:55:05.670 --> 00:55:11.020
the head of CBS, Clive
Davis, says to John, John,

00:55:11.020 --> 00:55:13.720
what should we call this?

00:55:13.720 --> 00:55:14.720
John said, I don't know.

00:55:14.720 --> 00:55:15.320
Zakir?

00:55:15.320 --> 00:55:16.810
I said, I don't know.

00:55:16.810 --> 00:55:18.360
It's music.

00:55:18.360 --> 00:55:20.680
We had no clue
what we were doing.

00:55:20.680 --> 00:55:21.730
For us it was just music.

00:55:21.730 --> 00:55:23.780
It wasn't like a little
of jazz, a little

00:55:23.780 --> 00:55:25.470
of Indian, a little
of South Indian

00:55:25.470 --> 00:55:27.780
and some Qawwali
rhythms and all that

00:55:27.780 --> 00:55:31.200
and let's call it
"confusion"-- none of that.

00:55:31.200 --> 00:55:32.430
We had no clue.

00:55:32.430 --> 00:55:34.840
For us it was just music.

00:55:34.840 --> 00:55:39.460
So when musicians get together
to play from different genres,

00:55:39.460 --> 00:55:43.330
they don't think that they
are creating a particular kind

00:55:43.330 --> 00:55:45.350
of fusion music.

00:55:45.350 --> 00:55:47.310
They're creating music.

00:55:47.310 --> 00:55:49.580
They're doing a
creative process, which

00:55:49.580 --> 00:55:51.920
they are enjoying and so on.

00:55:51.920 --> 00:55:53.860
But Clive Davis says,
but John, I really

00:55:53.860 --> 00:55:56.680
need to know what to
call it, because then I

00:55:56.680 --> 00:56:02.840
can label it and put it in the
right bin in Tower Records.

00:56:02.840 --> 00:56:07.060
And then we can also put
it in the right category

00:56:07.060 --> 00:56:10.190
for the Billboards
award or whatever.

00:56:10.190 --> 00:56:12.770
So they needed to
make a category.

00:56:12.770 --> 00:56:14.720
So when we started
doing that, there

00:56:14.720 --> 00:56:16.560
wasn't even a word fusion.

00:56:16.560 --> 00:56:19.700
There wasn't even a word
New Age or anything.

00:56:19.700 --> 00:56:22.130
When Madan Mohan did his
songs or Shanker Jaikishan

00:56:22.130 --> 00:56:25.010
did his song, there was no
"fusion" word or anything.

00:56:25.010 --> 00:56:26.870
But it was all happening.

00:56:26.870 --> 00:56:28.960
And it started way back then.

00:56:28.960 --> 00:56:32.910
So whether it's China,
Japan, you name it,

00:56:32.910 --> 00:56:36.190
they all have influences from
different parts of the world

00:56:36.190 --> 00:56:39.360
wherever the Raj went--
I mean British Raj--

00:56:39.360 --> 00:56:41.666
and wherever the French went.

00:56:41.666 --> 00:56:43.290
They all brought
whatever they brought,

00:56:43.290 --> 00:56:45.120
and it just kind of made it.

00:56:45.120 --> 00:56:49.700
So now what's happened,
which I like very much,

00:56:49.700 --> 00:56:54.300
is that the lines are
blurred, blurred in the sense

00:56:54.300 --> 00:56:58.080
that it used to be that
fusion music can only

00:56:58.080 --> 00:57:00.630
be in the Western world.

00:57:00.630 --> 00:57:02.390
And so it was legit.

00:57:02.390 --> 00:57:04.560
But now, people
all over the world

00:57:04.560 --> 00:57:09.020
are able to make music,
whether it's in Mali or Senegal

00:57:09.020 --> 00:57:15.230
or in Mauritius or
in Tokyo or wherever,

00:57:15.230 --> 00:57:17.360
and they are all
playing music, which

00:57:17.360 --> 00:57:24.170
has an interesting drive
towards universality.

00:57:24.170 --> 00:57:26.530
Instruments are common.

00:57:26.530 --> 00:57:28.830
Thought processes are common.

00:57:28.830 --> 00:57:31.680
And people are
starting to make music,

00:57:31.680 --> 00:57:33.440
whether it's Japan
or China or India

00:57:33.440 --> 00:57:40.110
or whatever, that stands on
its own anywhere in the world.

00:57:40.110 --> 00:57:42.560
And Bollywood is a
great example of it.

00:57:42.560 --> 00:57:45.500
It stands on its own
right here in America,

00:57:45.500 --> 00:57:47.930
and people go to
hear it and see it.

00:57:47.930 --> 00:57:50.920
And I'm not just
talking about us Desis.

00:57:50.920 --> 00:57:52.170
I'm talking about the natives.

00:57:55.990 --> 00:57:57.750
They all love to go
and hear this kind

00:57:57.750 --> 00:57:58.900
of music and everything.

00:57:58.900 --> 00:58:04.575
And so fusion, I don't know
if it's a category anymore.

00:58:04.575 --> 00:58:09.440
Because that means that you've
tried to divide the music up.

00:58:09.440 --> 00:58:11.550
Right now the music
is experiencing

00:58:11.550 --> 00:58:16.800
a universal understanding,
a collective acceptance,

00:58:16.800 --> 00:58:18.030
no matter where in the world.

00:58:18.030 --> 00:58:20.020
So they might have to
come up with a new name.

00:58:20.020 --> 00:58:20.970
VINOD MARUR: New name.

00:58:20.970 --> 00:58:21.657
Got it.

00:58:21.657 --> 00:58:23.490
ZAKIR HUSSAIN: I didn't
mean to lecture you,

00:58:23.490 --> 00:58:25.700
but-- actually, I did.

00:58:25.700 --> 00:58:27.874
[LAUGHTER]

00:58:27.874 --> 00:58:29.790
VINOD MARUR: That was a
beautiful performance,

00:58:29.790 --> 00:58:31.831
by the way, that you just
slipped in right there.

00:58:31.831 --> 00:58:34.270
And earlier when
we were chatting,

00:58:34.270 --> 00:58:35.911
you were talking
about Frank Sinatra.

00:58:35.911 --> 00:58:36.910
ZAKIR HUSSAIN: Oh, yeah.

00:58:36.910 --> 00:58:37.677
I've heard of him.

00:58:37.677 --> 00:58:38.979
[LAUGHTER]

00:58:38.979 --> 00:58:40.020
He's one of my favorites.

00:58:40.020 --> 00:58:40.580
VINOD MARUR: Would
you care to indulge us

00:58:40.580 --> 00:58:42.400
with a little bit of your
version of Frank Sinatra?

00:58:42.400 --> 00:58:44.066
ZAKIR HUSSAIN: Well,
you know his songs.

00:58:47.720 --> 00:58:52.570
Let me play among the stars.

00:58:52.570 --> 00:59:00.510
Let me see what spring is
like on Jupiter or Mars.

00:59:00.510 --> 00:59:04.623
In other words--
something like that.

00:59:04.623 --> 00:59:10.310
[APPLAUSE]

00:59:10.310 --> 00:59:12.810
VINOD MARUR: Trying to
stick on that theme, would

00:59:12.810 --> 00:59:14.940
you care to indulge
us with a little bit--

00:59:14.940 --> 00:59:16.298
ZAKIR HUSSAIN: Stay on the moon?

00:59:16.298 --> 00:59:17.394
[LAUGHTER]

00:59:17.394 --> 00:59:19.060
VINOD MARUR: I am on
the moon right now.

00:59:19.060 --> 00:59:21.370
I'll be honest and confess.

00:59:21.370 --> 00:59:24.870
[NON-ENGLISH SINGING]

00:59:28.140 --> 00:59:30.360
VINOD MARUR: There is
this tradition of padhant.

00:59:30.360 --> 00:59:30.870
ZAKIR HUSSAIN: Padhant.

00:59:30.870 --> 00:59:31.953
Yes, there is a tradition.

00:59:33.819 --> 00:59:35.610
VINOD MARUR: Will do
you explain what it is

00:59:35.610 --> 00:59:37.370
and maybe give us a
small demonstration?

00:59:37.370 --> 00:59:39.203
ZAKIR HUSSAIN: Well,
padhant is exactly what

00:59:39.203 --> 00:59:40.650
the word represents.

00:59:40.650 --> 00:59:44.120
In India, when you
ask somebody to read,

00:59:44.120 --> 00:59:48.210
you say [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]
or [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH].

00:59:48.210 --> 00:59:52.550
And what he reads is known
as [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH], OK?

00:59:52.550 --> 00:59:59.270
So as I said, music or rhythm,
they are all languages.

00:59:59.270 --> 01:00:02.290
You learn to speak it,
and therefore, you also

01:00:02.290 --> 01:00:04.140
learn to read it.

01:00:04.140 --> 01:00:08.890
So if you've written a
story, you have to read it.

01:00:08.890 --> 01:00:13.390
So the story is about Ta.

01:00:13.390 --> 01:00:15.590
OK, Ta.

01:00:15.590 --> 01:00:21.240
So Ta is friends with
[? Thetai. ?] And his

01:00:21.240 --> 01:00:27.060
girlfriend is [? Thina. ?] And
the villain is [? Gayna. ?]

01:00:27.060 --> 01:00:29.470
There's got to be a villain
or else the story is not

01:00:29.470 --> 01:00:31.550
interesting.

01:00:31.550 --> 01:00:37.070
So Ta, [? Thetai, ?]
they are-- you know.

01:00:37.070 --> 01:00:39.050
Ta, [? Thetai ?],
Ta, [? Thetai ?],

01:00:39.050 --> 01:00:41.040
[? Thetai, ?] [? Ta ?],
[? Ta ?], [? Thetai ?],

01:00:41.040 --> 01:00:46.260
[? Ta ?], [? Thina ?],
[? Gayna. ?] So I'm telling you

01:00:46.260 --> 01:00:47.920
a story, OK?

01:00:47.920 --> 01:00:51.670
So in other words,
I'm also reading what

01:00:51.670 --> 01:00:54.510
I have thought of or written.

01:00:54.510 --> 01:00:57.580
And so I'm doing the padhant.

01:00:57.580 --> 01:00:58.440
I am [INAUDIBLE].

01:01:01.180 --> 01:01:03.930
And so this is what padhant is.

01:01:03.930 --> 01:01:06.900
So when I'm learning
the language,

01:01:06.900 --> 01:01:09.140
my father used to
tell me, take a phrase

01:01:09.140 --> 01:01:12.310
and just get to know it.

01:01:12.310 --> 01:01:15.400
Like as if it's a
person, it's a character.

01:01:15.400 --> 01:01:17.530
Get to know it.

01:01:17.530 --> 01:01:18.750
[SPEAKING RHYTHMIC SYLLABLES]

01:01:18.750 --> 01:01:19.750
Suppose that's a phrase.

01:01:19.750 --> 01:01:37.580
[SPEAKING RHYTHMIC SYLLABLES]

01:01:37.580 --> 01:01:40.170
So this is a phrase,
which appears like this.

01:01:40.170 --> 01:01:44.820
And what I have to do is look
at it like this, like this,

01:01:44.820 --> 01:01:47.770
like this, like
this, all direction.

01:01:47.770 --> 01:01:50.610
So I've got to figure
out how many ways can I

01:01:50.610 --> 01:01:56.920
use that word in a phrase or
a sentence or a paragraph.

01:01:56.920 --> 01:02:00.410
So that's what
padhant is all about.

01:02:00.410 --> 01:02:04.780
And maybe that's where
rap first came from.

01:02:04.780 --> 01:02:08.850
So if I'm going, [SNAPPING]

So it suddenly becomes a groove,
like a drum groove, right?

01:02:38.790 --> 01:02:41.132
So it's not just robotic this.

01:02:41.132 --> 01:02:42.280

he's got a lot of tablas.

- [INAUDIBLE] was
on a VHS tape, 1988,

01:04:59.050 --> 01:05:01.280
at my grandfather's house.

And ever since that day, it
was love at first sight for me.

one of the luckiest people

very, very fortunate

VINOD MARUR: We close
with one question.

01:06:08.840 --> 01:06:12.840
As you look at
things like YouTube,

01:06:12.840 --> 01:06:14.640
Google, are there
things that you'd

01:06:14.640 --> 01:06:19.070
like to see us doing, whether
from a technology perspective,

01:06:19.070 --> 01:06:20.900
to have music, or just humanity?

01:06:23.770 --> 01:06:27.940
ZAKIR HUSSAIN: Well,
Google, I mean, I

01:06:27.940 --> 01:06:32.220
would have to say that
the technology that you

01:06:32.220 --> 01:06:35.130
are involved in, I
would imagine you

01:06:35.130 --> 01:06:37.690
would say it's in its infancy.

01:06:37.690 --> 01:06:39.500
It has a long ways to go.

01:06:39.500 --> 01:06:41.620
And the sky's the limit.

01:06:41.620 --> 01:06:46.280
And you've seen that there's a
light at the end of the tunnel.

01:06:46.280 --> 01:06:48.350
But it's like looking
at the sun setting

01:06:48.350 --> 01:06:50.750
and wanting to touch it,
and it's way out there.

01:06:50.750 --> 01:06:52.900
And it's like with music.

01:06:52.900 --> 01:06:57.490
I mean, it's about the journey.

01:06:57.490 --> 01:06:59.650
You will never be perfect.

01:06:59.650 --> 01:07:01.870
There is no such thing
as being perfect.

01:07:01.870 --> 01:07:08.260
But the point is, you trying
to be as best as you can.

01:07:08.260 --> 01:07:13.580
I heard from a great jazz
musician named Charles Lloyd.

01:07:13.580 --> 01:07:16.360
Somebody asked him
and said, Master,

01:07:16.360 --> 01:07:18.400
you were perfect tonight.

01:07:18.400 --> 01:07:21.550
And he said that
I said, I haven't

01:07:21.550 --> 01:07:24.800
played good enough to quit.

01:07:24.800 --> 01:07:26.650
That is a very deep statement.

01:07:26.650 --> 01:07:30.460
If you think you've
done the best you can,

01:07:30.460 --> 01:07:34.230
you might as well hang up
your boots, power down.

01:07:34.230 --> 01:07:38.130
So that's not what
this technology is.

01:07:38.130 --> 01:07:44.520
This technology actually expects
that you'll be on full power

01:07:44.520 --> 01:07:47.950
all the way through,
whatever that future is.

01:07:47.950 --> 01:07:53.409
And so there are many aspects
of web technology and whatnot

01:07:53.409 --> 01:07:54.450
that you are involved in.

01:07:54.450 --> 01:07:59.110
And I imagine that it keeps
getting better and better,

01:07:59.110 --> 01:08:00.630
and you're finding
new ways to be

01:08:00.630 --> 01:08:04.230
able to make it more
user friendly and so on.

01:08:04.230 --> 01:08:08.040
And there's always a fight
between Google Maps and Apple

01:08:08.040 --> 01:08:08.540
Maps.

01:08:08.540 --> 01:08:11.310
And when I'm sitting
in the car, my wife's

01:08:11.310 --> 01:08:15.150
like, Google, and my
daughter is like, Google Map.

01:08:15.150 --> 01:08:16.450
And I'm like, no, Apple Map.

01:08:16.450 --> 01:08:19.210
And then we're like not
sure which one, but then

01:08:19.210 --> 01:08:20.479
we finally end up with Waze.

01:08:20.479 --> 01:08:21.020
I don't know.

01:08:21.020 --> 01:08:24.460
[LAUGHTER]

01:08:24.460 --> 01:08:29.609
No, but the technology
is still blossoming.

01:08:29.609 --> 01:08:32.620
And there's a lot that's
going on, which I mean,

01:08:32.620 --> 01:08:38.069
it's like you find something
and you share it today,

01:08:38.069 --> 01:08:40.260
and tomorrow it's obsolete.

01:08:40.260 --> 01:08:43.540
And so it's kind of hard to
tell what you should improve on.

01:08:43.540 --> 01:08:47.359
I imagine that every
aspect or subject

01:08:47.359 --> 01:08:50.260
that you have introduced
in the world of Google

01:08:50.260 --> 01:08:56.939
or "Googlay" you will constantly
be upgrading or making

01:08:56.939 --> 01:09:01.130
better or making more
user-friendly and easy

01:09:01.130 --> 01:09:04.729
to handle for dumb bums like me.

01:09:04.729 --> 01:09:09.260
But apart from there, all
I can say is more power

01:09:09.260 --> 01:09:10.438
and go for it.
