00:00:00.022 --> 00:00:05.020
[SOUND] That was beautiful.

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:05.745
&gt;&gt; That was tiring.

00:00:05.745 --> 00:00:06.557
&gt;&gt; It was tiring.

00:00:06.557 --> 00:00:09.323
That was a very long,
long, long flashback.

00:00:09.323 --> 00:00:11.009
&gt;&gt; It was like two whole
lessons of flashback.

00:00:11.009 --> 00:00:13.367
&gt;&gt; Two whole lessons of flashback,
hence Game Theory III.

00:00:13.367 --> 00:00:14.850
&gt;&gt; All right, well now that we're back.

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:17.881
[LAUGH] Is there anything left to say or
do we basically cover everything?

00:00:17.881 --> 00:00:20.223
&gt;&gt; Well, I think we covered
almost everything, but

00:00:20.223 --> 00:00:22.509
if you recall from
the flashback there were two or

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:25.431
three things we said were probably
best left for another day.

00:00:25.431 --> 00:00:25.966
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; And

00:00:25.966 --> 00:00:27.677
it turns out that today is another day.

00:00:27.677 --> 00:00:29.529
&gt;&gt; Not according to that video, right.

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:32.460
If they watch that video now,
then today is that day.

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.330
&gt;&gt; Every single person who
watch those videos had to take

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:35.020
several days to do it.

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:35.840
&gt;&gt; All right, that's fair.

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.078
&gt;&gt; At least emotionally, so
I'm going to claim it's another day.

00:00:38.078 --> 00:00:41.589
And so we're going to talk about three
things that we said that we wanted to

00:00:41.589 --> 00:00:42.593
talk about before.

00:00:42.593 --> 00:00:46.183
In particular, we're going to
talk about solution concepts.

00:00:46.183 --> 00:00:49.140
And we're going to spend a little bit
of time talking about mechanism design.

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.460
&gt;&gt; Neat.
&gt;&gt; So, let's start with some

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:52.210
solution concepts.
