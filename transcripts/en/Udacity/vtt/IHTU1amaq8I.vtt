00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Let's take a look at the answers.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
This 33 is definitely going to match, we hope--

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
we're going to get to this in a minute--our numbering rule.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
And then we're going to end up converting it into an integer.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
33 looks pretty good.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Is will match the word is.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Less will match the word less. Than will match the word than.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
55 could be converted to a number, give us the integer 55.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
And all of this white space in the middle will be dropped.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
This is a possible answer.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Here we have pretty much the same thing except that

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.000
we appear to be returning a space as a word.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
That's not going to happen because our words can't include spaces,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
and this white space rule would skip over it beforehand.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
That's not it.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Here looks a lot like the beginning,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
but instead of matching 33 and 55 as numbers,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
we appear to have matched them as words because

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
we've returned this string unchanged.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
This isn't really what we wanted,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
but actually, nothing prevents that from happening.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
33 could match either our word regular expression--

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
33 is not a space, it's not a less than, it's not a greater than--

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
or our number definition, and I haven't told you how to resolve

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
this sort of ambiguity.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Oh, that word is back from the dead.

00:01:25.000 --> 09:59:59.000
This is also a possible answer.
