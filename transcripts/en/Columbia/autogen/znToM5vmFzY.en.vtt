our attention right so we're really and
 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.929
our attention right so we're really and
and how do you dig a distinction between

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939
and how do you dig a distinction between
 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.519
and how do you dig a distinction between
the built environment and the

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529
the built environment and the
 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.160
the built environment and the

environment while you can so actually
 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.349
environment while you can so actually
it's the sort of school devoted to the

00:00:36.349 --> 00:00:36.359
it's the sort of school devoted to the
 

00:00:36.359 --> 00:00:38.779
it's the sort of school devoted to the
planet if you think about it so it

00:00:38.779 --> 00:00:38.789
planet if you think about it so it
 

00:00:38.789 --> 00:00:40.430
planet if you think about it so it
really is in a certain sense a very very

really is in a certain sense a very very
 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.739
really is in a certain sense a very very
ambitious place that's trying to think

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:42.749
ambitious place that's trying to think
 

00:00:42.749 --> 00:00:44.649
ambitious place that's trying to think
about the future of the kind of global

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:44.659
about the future of the kind of global
 

00:00:44.659 --> 00:00:47.239
about the future of the kind of global
situation and trying to do so with kind

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:47.249
situation and trying to do so with kind
 

00:00:47.249 --> 00:00:50.709
situation and trying to do so with kind
of real creativity and real experience

00:00:50.709 --> 00:00:50.719
of real creativity and real experience
 

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:53.239

you're a little different than the

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:53.249
you're a little different than the
 

00:00:53.249 --> 00:00:54.889
you're a little different than the
people that we celebrated in the

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899
people that we celebrated in the
 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.259
people that we celebrated in the
previous situation and the previous

00:00:57.259 --> 00:00:57.269
previous situation and the previous
 

00:00:57.269 --> 00:00:58.910
previous situation and the previous
situation you've got these hotshots that

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920
situation you've got these hotshots that
 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.469
situation you've got these hotshots that
fly into the school at high speed and

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:00.479
fly into the school at high speed and
 

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:03.109
fly into the school at high speed and
fly out at high speed and all you feel

00:01:03.109 --> 00:01:03.119
fly out at high speed and all you feel
 

00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:04.610
fly out at high speed and all you feel
is the sort of turbulence that they

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:04.620
is the sort of turbulence that they
 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:06.530
is the sort of turbulence that they
create within the school but that

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540
create within the school but that
 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:07.880
create within the school but that
turbulence is also something that

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890
turbulence is also something that
 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.620
turbulence is also something that
contributes to your education because

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630
contributes to your education because
 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.300
contributes to your education because
you're here for one two and three years

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310
you're here for one two and three years
 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.370
you're here for one two and three years
or two years like different rhythm so

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380
or two years like different rhythm so
 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.180
or two years like different rhythm so
you get sort of affected by their

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:16.190
you get sort of affected by their
 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:18.140
you get sort of affected by their
turbulence but also you get in there

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150
turbulence but also you get in there
 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:19.430
turbulence but also you get in there
away in other words they're going very

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:19.440
away in other words they're going very
 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:21.110
away in other words they're going very
fast and they basically bang into you

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:21.120
fast and they basically bang into you
 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:22.970
fast and they basically bang into you
because you're coming up and then you

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:22.980
because you're coming up and then you
 

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:25.040
because you're coming up and then you
hit together so what happens is two

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:25.050
hit together so what happens is two
 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:27.890
hit together so what happens is two
different kinds of species interact and

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900
different kinds of species interact and
 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.570
different kinds of species interact and
the collision between you is so powerful

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:29.580
the collision between you is so powerful
 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:31.850
the collision between you is so powerful
that afterwards nobody can remember who

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860
that afterwards nobody can remember who
 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.520
that afterwards nobody can remember who
came in Fast and who came in slow and

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530
came in Fast and who came in slow and
 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.860
came in Fast and who came in slow and
then you sort of all leave together but

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:36.870
then you sort of all leave together but
 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:38.420
then you sort of all leave together but
I do think that in the end even though

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430
I do think that in the end even though
 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:39.980
I do think that in the end even though
we no longer can tell the difference

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990
we no longer can tell the difference
 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.930
we no longer can tell the difference
between your work and the work of the

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:41.940
between your work and the work of the
 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:45.350
between your work and the work of the
post professional programs it's still a

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360
post professional programs it's still a
 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.149
post professional programs it's still a
different threshold for you because you

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159
different threshold for you because you
 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:48.440
different threshold for you because you
are with us for longer and it's

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450
are with us for longer and it's
 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.480
are with us for longer and it's
therefore a different threshold for us

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490
therefore a different threshold for us
 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.090
therefore a different threshold for us
because we know you much better and we

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100
because we know you much better and we
 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.520
because we know you much better and we
are Believe It or Not sadder about you

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530
are Believe It or Not sadder about you
 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.760
are Believe It or Not sadder about you
leaving than anyone else you come to us

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770
leaving than anyone else you come to us
 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.010
leaving than anyone else you come to us
from about 65 different countries and

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020
from about 65 different countries and
 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.110
from about 65 different countries and
then use maybe you hang around New York

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:03.120
then use maybe you hang around New York
 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:06.230
then use maybe you hang around New York
for a while and then you return usually

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240
for a while and then you return usually
 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.229
for a while and then you return usually
to where you came from so in theory we

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239
to where you came from so in theory we
 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.390
to where you came from so in theory we
are supposed to be educating you but in

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400
are supposed to be educating you but in
 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.080
are supposed to be educating you but in
practice you educate us and meantime you

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090
practice you educate us and meantime you
 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.300
practice you educate us and meantime you
educate each other and we just pretend

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310
educate each other and we just pretend
 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.210
educate each other and we just pretend
to be here more or less intelligently

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220
to be here more or less intelligently
 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.880
to be here more or less intelligently
watching the future of the planet are

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890
watching the future of the planet are
 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:27.020
watching the future of the planet are
evolved so you're on this threshold and

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030
evolved so you're on this threshold and
 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:28.399
evolved so you're on this threshold and
you're about to leave but the point I

00:02:28.399 --> 00:02:28.409
you're about to leave but the point I
 

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:29.780
you're about to leave but the point I
want to make to you is that the school

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790
want to make to you is that the school
 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.429
want to make to you is that the school
is absolutely not the same as the school

00:02:31.429 --> 00:02:31.439
is absolutely not the same as the school
 

00:02:31.439 --> 00:02:33.949
is absolutely not the same as the school
you first arrived in because even if

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959
you first arrived in because even if
 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:36.770
you first arrived in because even if
that building was designed in 1911 and

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780
that building was designed in 1911 and
 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.210
that building was designed in 1911 and
even if it's supposed to tell the world

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220
even if it's supposed to tell the world
 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.610
even if it's supposed to tell the world
that everything is fixed and stable and

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620
that everything is fixed and stable and
 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.920
that everything is fixed and stable and
everything goes back to cosmological

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930
everything goes back to cosmological
 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.190
everything goes back to cosmological
truths and proportions and so on inside

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200
truths and proportions and so on inside
 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.009
truths and proportions and so on inside
that building it's totally crazy and

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:49.019
that building it's totally crazy and
 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:51.289
that building it's totally crazy and
there's so much energy inside that

00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:51.299
there's so much energy inside that
 

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:52.399
there's so much energy inside that
building that actually the whole

00:02:52.399 --> 00:02:52.409
building that actually the whole
 

00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:55.339
building that actually the whole
building moves it's a kind of a ship you

00:02:55.339 --> 00:02:55.349
building moves it's a kind of a ship you
 

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:56.990
building moves it's a kind of a ship you
get into the ship and it goes somewhere

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000
get into the ship and it goes somewhere
 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.119
get into the ship and it goes somewhere
and you are the people who have actually

00:02:59.119 --> 00:02:59.129
and you are the people who have actually
 

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:02.539
and you are the people who have actually
made the ship move it's super exciting

00:03:02.539 --> 00:03:02.549
made the ship move it's super exciting
 

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:05.420
made the ship move it's super exciting
that we don't know where it's going we

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430
that we don't know where it's going we
 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:08.890
that we don't know where it's going we
don't know why we don't even know what

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:08.900
don't know why we don't even know what
 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:12.080
don't know why we don't even know what
architecture is right I keep telling you

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090
architecture is right I keep telling you
 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.149
architecture is right I keep telling you
that that we don't know I think finally

00:03:14.149 --> 00:03:14.159
that that we don't know I think finally
 

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:15.619
that that we don't know I think finally
now that you're graduating you realize

00:03:15.619 --> 00:03:15.629
now that you're graduating you realize
 

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:19.159
now that you're graduating you realize
that none of us know but it is the

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:19.169
that none of us know but it is the
 

00:03:19.169 --> 00:03:20.869
that none of us know but it is the
question we always always ask ourselves

00:03:20.869 --> 00:03:20.879
question we always always ask ourselves
 

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:22.759
question we always always ask ourselves
what it is this build environment that

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:22.769
what it is this build environment that
 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:24.770
what it is this build environment that
we take care of and precisely because we

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780
we take care of and precisely because we
 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:27.890
we take care of and precisely because we
don't know what it is we love it we

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900
don't know what it is we love it we
 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.080
don't know what it is we love it we
really love it because it's full of all

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090
really love it because it's full of all
 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:32.890
really love it because it's full of all
this mystery and all of our expertise is

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:32.900
this mystery and all of our expertise is
 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:36.140
this mystery and all of our expertise is
applied to them so I think the main

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150
applied to them so I think the main
 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:37.819

the school you just leave them behind
 

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:42.420
the school you just leave them behind
you go through and the slipstream and

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:42.430
you go through and the slipstream and
 

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:44.040
you go through and the slipstream and
fly for and say look you're an old

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:44.050
fly for and say look you're an old

can't wait for you things have to be

00:06:48.029 --> 00:06:48.039
can't wait for you things have to be
 

00:06:48.039 --> 00:06:49.889
can't wait for you things have to be
done in the world so essentially this

00:06:49.889 --> 00:06:49.899
done in the world so essentially this
 

00:06:49.899 --> 00:06:51.629
done in the world so essentially this
threshold that you're on as a threshold

00:06:51.629 --> 00:06:51.639

when you've actually already left your
teachers behind you symbolically now

00:06:55.649 --> 00:06:55.659

leave the school behind but something

00:06:57.990 --> 00:06:58.000
leave the school behind but something
 

00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:59.639
leave the school behind but something
will happen about 10 years from now so

00:06:59.639 --> 00:06:59.649
will happen about 10 years from now so
 

00:06:59.649 --> 00:07:01.379
will happen about 10 years from now so
in other words what we do when we are

00:07:01.379 --> 00:07:01.389
in other words what we do when we are
 

00:07:01.389 --> 00:07:03.629
in other words what we do when we are
teaching you is we take care of
