00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:05.160
Being in a relationship

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.780
where it doesn't feel like there's enough sex

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:11.420
sounds like a trivial and somewhat comedic luxury problem

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:12.740
As though someone were complaining

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:14.200
there wasn't enough tennis or yoga

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:15.240
between a couple.

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:17.200
But an absence of sex

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:18.140
isn't trivial in the least.

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:20.960
It's a humblingly serious problem

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:24.000
and might even be what dooms the relationship itself.

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.380
One statistic stands out:

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:27.620
in an average year,

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:29.060
in the OECD countries,

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.780
70% of those who initiate a divorce

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:36.020
cited a lack of sex as the first or second reason for parting.

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.300
If there's one generalization we can make about couples,

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.640
it's that a lack of sex,

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.800
by which we mean something like less than four times a month,

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.140
is an alarm bell we should listen to.

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:50.260
Why is sex such a key part of keeping two people close?

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.020
Because in sex, two people accept each other

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:54.940
in the most profound of ways.

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.140
The apparently dirty and shameful sides of us,

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.900
the way weird fantasies and the unusual longings,

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.140
are legitimated through sex.

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.000
Someone else witnesses and accepts us

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.340
as bodily and psychological beings.

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:11.260
Sex symbolises an end to loneliness

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.260
and a reaffirmation of trust.

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.500
Not daring or wanting to have sex with a partner

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.120
is tantamount to admitting that one can't be oneself in their presence.

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.460
A lack of sex is bad enough,

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:29.900
but far worse is the way in which the reciprocated longing for sex tends to manifest itself.

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.940
Typically, a person who wants it doesn't ask very clearly,

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:39.280
maybe merely sliding a hand over in a timid, half-hearted search for reciprocation.

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.420
They don't complain calmly,

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:46.400
don't deliver an eloquent self-confidence speech about how difficult they're finding it,

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:50.480
and don't inquire sympathetically as to what might be going on in their partner.

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.020
Far too often, they tend to quickly move on to symptomatic behavior,

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:00.320
where in their disappointment and sense of humiliation, are acted out, rather than discussed.

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:05.480
They bang dishes, they get mean, a whole raft of conflicts then develops

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:09.980
that has ostensibly nothing to do with sex, and yet is caused by its absence.

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.760
One starts squabbling over the in-laws in the state of the kitchen.

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:18.800
The one who's been let down sexually behaves so badly, they start to seem like a monster,

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.920
further reducing the chances of sex ever taking place.

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:28.340
Eventually, the sex-starved party may simply go off and have an affair, not because they don't love their partner,

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.140
but because showing their desire has become so fraught with rejection

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:34.580
that they're out for a bit of revenge.

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:37.580
The lack of sex discussion is so hard to have

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:41.340
because quite simply, it feels so shameful to be unwanted sexually.

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.520
It plays into every worst fear about unacceptability.

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:47.740
It's bad enough when it happens on a date.

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:52.040
It's even sadder to have to admit that one's being rejected by one's partner

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:56.380
inside the apparent safety and commitment of a long term relationship.

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:03.080
Maybe there's something wrong with them, but far more likely, there's something revolting about us.

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:09.800
The key to a process of reconciliation is to rein in one's wilder feelings of rejection and self-disgust

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:14.600
in order to be able to consider why the other party might have gone off sex.

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:18.420
Here's a key fact: everyone wants sex in principle.

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:23.440
When it isn't wanted, it's because the condition for sex is not being met,

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:25.280
and then, not communicated.

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:30.340
Privately, the sex-rejecting party has a problem they're not sharing.

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:36.860
They might in secret be thinking, "I might have sex, if only you listened more to my problems with my family,"

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:39.320
or, "If you gave me more time to do my work,"

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:42.600
or, "If you weren't so mean to me around domestic chores."

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:44.420
There might be kinkier reasons:

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:48.340
"I'd have more sex if you allow me to play out certain fantasies,"

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:50.800
"If you were more broad minded about role playing,"

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:54.260
"If you were more into kissing, or wanted it rough, or could be more submissive."

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.820
The person being denied sex

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:03.740
hasn't usually had any chance to hear these reasons in plain, unaccusing, gentle terms.

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:09.060
Or maybe they've heard them, but without a sober awareness of what's really at stake here.

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:12.300
There's been no proper communication.

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:17.640
Therefore, a classic recommendation, deliberately artificial, is that the two parties,

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:21.720
aware that their entire relationship properly depends on getting this right,

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:26.580
should write each other a letter titled simply, "What I want from sex."

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:30.900
It's a chance to be deeply honest about your true sexual identity;

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:36.040
it's then incumbent on both parties to take the other's words seriously and in good faith.

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:39.900
Two people are always going to be a bit sexually incompatible,

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:42.540
but we shouldn't get so scared and angry at this

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:46.640
that we create a secondary barrier of hurt, punishment, and shame.

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:49.440
We should take the first steps to finding a way

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:51.820
in which what you want and they want

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:54.200
can, in a modest way, be harmonized,

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:56.860
and the sarcasm and banging dishes can stop.

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:02.120
Every time such a conversation about sex happens in the quiet of the night,

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:05.720
the angels of relationships hover over the bedroom

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:09.160
and sound their silent trumpets in celebration,

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:17.460
because another couple have just critically improved their chances of lasting a little longer together.
