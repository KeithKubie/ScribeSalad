00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:05.130
Is it okay to just use a cell phone
camera to record video of your users?

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.630
Is there any minimum
required video product?

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:16.370
&gt;&gt; Honestly, the minimum required video
product is a flip phone from the 90s.

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:17.235
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; Right,

00:00:17.235 --> 00:00:21.130
recording video is
the most important thing.

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:26.870
As long as you have some kind of video,
from some angle, somewhere, it works.

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:31.220
Ideally you have a cell phone, a cell
phone video is fine, laptop is fine.

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:33.910
If you have a professional camera,
feel free to bring it.

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:38.960
But actually sometimes bringing
a professional camera Is too much.

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:40.575
&gt;&gt; Right.
&gt;&gt; You don't need that quality,

00:00:40.575 --> 00:00:41.675
that high quality video, right?

00:00:41.675 --> 00:00:43.930
You're not making an Apple promo video.

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:47.690
All you need is enough to put up
on a conference room screen for

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:52.770
somebody else to see, either a VC or
a PM or your engineers.

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.570
&gt;&gt; Right.
&gt;&gt; Or even other designers.

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.240
Right, because humans are really good
at figuring out the emotional import of

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:00.150
video, even if it's grainy and low res.

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:03.940
&gt;&gt; Yeah, and if you do bring
a big professional camera,

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:09.130
it might make your test subjects
feel a little bit intimidated.

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:12.420
You don't need to bring lights, you
don't need to bring a boom microphone or

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:13.700
anything like that.

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.510
Just have a little cell phone camera,
prop it up on something.

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:20.635
You can get one of those twisty
tripods to stick your camera on.

00:01:20.635 --> 00:01:24.782
There are other little tiny flip cams,
little video cameras,

00:01:24.782 --> 00:01:29.280
with actual quarter inch holes in
the bottom to stick onto tripods.

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:35.090
Those work great too, but
the main goal is keep it informal so

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:38.870
the people don't feel insinuated,
but just collect some kind of video.

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:41.440
&gt;&gt; Right.
&gt;&gt; One thing to note is that audio is

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:42.570
also really important.

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.890
And so, cell phones generally do a
pretty good job of recording audio, but

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:48.660
it's worth checking the audio to
make sure that you can understand

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:50.170
what the people are saying.

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:53.390
Again, you don't need a boom mic,
you don't need to mic the person, but

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:56.830
it's really useful to make
sure that you can hear them.

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:58.930
One thing you can actually
do is buy a separate,

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:03.210
higher quality audio recorder which
tend to be fairly small and unobtrusive.

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.670
Hit record, put it on the table,
leave it there running, clap or

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.074
something in the video to sync
up the audio and the video.

00:02:10.074 --> 00:02:12.630
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.
&gt;&gt; And then just leave the audio out of

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:15.350
the video recorder, and
use the audio from the table recorder.

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:16.740
&gt;&gt; Right.
&gt;&gt; Which tends to be much better.

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:17.930
&gt;&gt; Awesome, thank you.
