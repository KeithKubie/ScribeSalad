00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
You know, back in the '40s and '50s,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.970
the original standard television 
had a 4 to 3 width to height ratio.

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:22.480
That shape was chosen 
to be a slight rectangle,

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.366
but still mostly square, thus having 
the maximal screen area

00:00:25.366 --> 00:00:27.122
for the given dimensions.

00:00:27.122 --> 00:00:31.000
And that's still the ratio on many TVs 
and computer monitors in today's homes.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.910
The problem is, hardly anybody today 
treats video content in a 4 to 3 ratio.

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.420
See, this whole problem started

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:39.870
when people wanted 
to watch movies from the theater

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.550
in the comfort of their own homes.

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.580
Movie screens are considerably larger 
than our home television.

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:47.510
More important, the screen 
is completely different rectangle

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:50.850
and can't mathematically fit 
on our TV screens without manipulation.

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.250
A typical TV is one and a third times
wider than it is tall

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.210
Some movie screens could be up to 
three times as wide as it is tall.

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:01.880
So what're we going to do to make it fit? 
Well, we have all kinds of options.

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:05.470
Well, we could squeeze and stretch 
and mangle everything onto the screen,

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:06.670
to make it all fill up,

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:09.380
and everyone would look
ridiculously thin and compressed.

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:11.580
The good news is
the sound would be just fine,

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.790
although I don't think people would be 
too happy about that option,

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.550
particularly the actors in the movie.

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.560
We could just cut a chunk 
of the original movie like a cookie cutter

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.340
and just see that frame of the movie.

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:23.220
The problem with that would be 
people and objects

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.006
would be speaking from off the screen,
or, even worse, they might be cut in half.

00:01:27.006 --> 00:01:29.450
Some movie editors use what's called
the "pan and scan" technique

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:31.990
to allow the full height 
of the TV screen to be used,

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:34.610
but pick and choose what section 
of the original movie

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:36.040
should be shown on your screen

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:38.340
thus eliminating the annoying 
cutting of people.

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.363
Imagine that job: staring at a 4 to 3 hole

00:01:40.363 --> 00:01:42.596
watching movies all day, 
deciding for everyone

00:01:42.596 --> 00:01:45.960
which piece of the screen is
the most important part for people to see.

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.550
Now let's do a little quick math.

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:51.710
If we compare a major cinematic film 
produced on a 2.35 to 1 aspect frame

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:54.050
with my standard 4 to 3 TV screen,

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:58.130
we find out that only 55% of the movie 
can actually fit on the screen

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:59.270
at any one time.

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:00.910
Just over half!

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:04.280
You've seen the disclaimer 
at the beginning of the movie on TV or DVD

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.110
that says, 
"This film has been modified

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:08.560
from its original format 
to fit on your TV screen."

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:09.880
Well, what it should say is,

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.720
"We are only displaying 55% 
of the movie of our choosing."

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.910
Now for all the full-screen TV lovers,

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:16.533
this is your dilemma:

00:02:16.533 --> 00:02:19.376
do you want to see all the movie, 
or is 55% good enough?

00:02:19.376 --> 00:02:21.150
How about new TVs?

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.650
Around the start of the century, 
some widescreen TVs

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:27.250
emerged in a 16 to 9, or 1.78 times 
wider than it is tall.

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:29.720
Well, this screen fits 
the movie a little better,

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.920
but still only shows 75% 
of the original movie at one time.

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.116
Suppose someone made 
a TV for your living room

00:02:35.116 --> 00:02:37.722
that was actually 2.35 to 1 
to show those full movies?

00:02:37.722 --> 00:02:40.930
Well, the TV with the same height 
as the most current 50-inch TVs -

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:43.110
that TV would be close to six feet long.

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:46.730
And on top of that, you'd only use 
the full screen when you watched movies.

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:49.270
Most of the other content 
would have to be stretched,

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:51.530
or have empty space on 
the sides of the screen.

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:53.320
Of course, there is one more option.

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:55.730
We can just shrink
the movie screen proportionally,

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:57.710
to fit the width of your home television.

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:01.500
We can mathematically scale the original 
to fit exactly the width of the screen

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.850
and this'll preserve 
the entire movie screen,

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:06.610
but show the infamous black bars
along the top and bottom

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:08.860
that so many television watchers abhor.

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:12.240
Of course, now you can argue 
that we're only using 75% of that screen.

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:14.120
And that is where the real question is:

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:17.450
do you want your full screen, 
or do you want to see the entire movie?

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:19.786
Most likely, you just need a bigger TV.
