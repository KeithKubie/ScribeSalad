00:00:00.633 --> 00:00:02.233
Voiceover:Karim has developed a new method

00:00:02.233 --> 00:00:04.233
for measuring cholesterol
level that doesn't

00:00:04.233 --> 00:00:06.967
involve any invasive
procedure, like drawing blood.

00:00:06.967 --> 00:00:08.266
Well, that would be very nice.

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:10.900
Regulations demand that
the test should be correct

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:13.534
99% of the time.

00:00:14.034 --> 00:00:16.333
Test should be correct 99% of the time.

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.900
So he had to verify that his method meets

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.133
the standards.

00:00:20.433 --> 00:00:23.634
He got a random sample
of 100 people, tested

00:00:23.634 --> 00:00:26.166
their cholesterol using his new method,

00:00:26.166 --> 00:00:28.033
compared the results to blood tests

00:00:28.033 --> 00:00:30.033
performed on the same people, and found

00:00:30.033 --> 00:00:33.266
they were the same 95% of the time.

00:00:33.766 --> 00:00:37.234
Since blood tests are
always correct, he concluded

00:00:37.234 --> 00:00:40.333
that his method was
correct 95% of the time.

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.433
That seems reasonable,
at least for his sample

00:00:42.433 --> 00:00:43.733
right over here.

00:00:44.033 --> 00:00:46.300
In light of the results, Karim had to test

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.900
the hypothesis that the test is, in fact,

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:51.333
correct 99% of the time.

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:54.300
So he wanted to test the hypothesis that

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.266
the test is, in fact,
correct 99% of the time.

00:00:57.567 --> 00:01:00.100
So he performed 100 computer generated

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.533
simulations of random
samples of 100 tests.

00:01:03.633 --> 00:01:04.767
So there's a lot of 100's here.

00:01:04.767 --> 00:01:07.100
So he did 100 simulations
and each of those

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.766
samples essentially
simulated the test results

00:01:10.766 --> 00:01:12.333
of 100 people.

00:01:12.433 --> 00:01:14.700
So it's like using a computer that assumes

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.100
this assumption.

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:17.900
That assumes that the
test is, in fact, correct

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.100
99% of the time, and to simulate 100

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.800
of these samples.

00:01:23.966 --> 00:01:26.166
100 samples, each of them having 100

00:01:26.166 --> 00:01:27.400
people in them.

00:01:27.767 --> 00:01:29.233
Supposing the true percentage of correct

00:01:29.233 --> 00:01:31.834
result is 99%, to find how likely it is

00:01:31.834 --> 00:01:36.733
that a sample would have
95% correct results.

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.400
The results of the
simulations are plotted below.

00:01:39.833 --> 00:01:41.766
How do the results of
the simulations affect

00:01:41.766 --> 00:01:44.300
the likelihood of the
hypothesis that Karim's

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.733
test is correct 99% of the time?

00:01:48.034 --> 00:01:49.833
So I know this can be
a little bit confusing

00:01:49.833 --> 00:01:51.233
because we have all of these ...

00:01:51.233 --> 00:01:54.267
We're testing and 100's and all of this.

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:55.966
But what he's doing, he said, "Okay."

00:01:55.966 --> 00:01:58.700
He got his test, on this
one sample, his test

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:00.400
was right 95% of the time.

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:02.500
But what he wants to really figure out is,

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.033
he wants to get a sense
of what's the probability

00:02:04.033 --> 00:02:07.100
of that happening, assuming that his test

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.067
is actually correct 99% of the time?

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:12.066
So he has the hypothesis.

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:14.266
So if we assumed the hypothesis ...

00:02:14.367 --> 00:02:17.967
If you assumed, if you assumed his test,

00:02:17.967 --> 00:02:26.566
his test, his test correct,
correct 99% of the time.

00:02:26.566 --> 00:02:28.333
So that's the hypothesis right over here.

00:02:28.633 --> 00:02:31.434
Then if we assume this,
he's trying to figure out

00:02:31.434 --> 00:02:33.866
what's the probability
that he gets these results?

00:02:34.367 --> 00:02:40.433
What is probability, probability of this

00:02:40.433 --> 00:02:41.866
right over here?

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.966
Because if this probability is really low,

00:02:44.966 --> 00:02:48.500
if the probability of
getting this is really low,

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.633
then he can say, "Well
then I can't make the ...

00:02:50.633 --> 00:02:53.101
"Then I really don't feel good about

00:02:53.101 --> 00:02:56.366
"assuming this hypothesis.
That maybe we can't

00:02:56.366 --> 00:02:59.400
"go with the hypothesis if
the probability of this ..."

00:03:00.833 --> 00:03:02.833
If the probability of
him seeing what he saw

00:03:02.833 --> 00:03:05.266
is very low, given this assumption.

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.000
So let's look at that.

00:03:07.767 --> 00:03:09.033
So let's interpret what's happening

00:03:09.033 --> 00:03:10.333
in this chart here.

00:03:10.366 --> 00:03:12.996
So remember, this computer
is running 100 ...

00:03:14.642 --> 00:03:18.033
It's simulating 100 samples, each of those

00:03:18.033 --> 00:03:20.000
samples have 100 people.

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:21.733
So for each sample ...

00:03:21.966 --> 00:03:23.100
So let me make it clear.

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:24.266
So this is sample one.

00:03:25.033 --> 00:03:30.033
So sample, sample number
one and then there'd

00:03:30.033 --> 00:03:33.349
be sample number two
and there's going to be,

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:35.933
there's going to be 100 of these samples.

00:03:35.968 --> 00:03:38.633
Each of these samples,
the computer is saying,

00:03:38.633 --> 00:03:41.700
"Okay, there's 100 people in each sample.

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:43.233
"One, two, three ..."

00:03:43.233 --> 00:03:44.500
And it goes all the way to the hundredth,

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:46.600
all the way to the hundredth person.

00:03:46.633 --> 00:03:48.366
For each of these the computer is saying,

00:03:48.366 --> 00:03:50.700
"Okay, I'm assuming there's a 99% chance

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:51.566
"that it's correct."

00:03:51.566 --> 00:03:53.033
So the computer uses its random number

00:03:53.033 --> 00:03:54.500
generators, essentially kind of trying

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:55.600
to roll the dice.

00:03:55.701 --> 00:03:57.766
And 99 out of 100 times, it'll say

00:03:57.766 --> 00:03:59.733
the sample is ...

00:03:59.767 --> 00:04:02.800
The new test matches up to the old test.

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:05.166
But then, every now and then, there's

00:04:05.166 --> 00:04:06.833
that one percent chance that it says,

00:04:06.833 --> 00:04:08.500
"Okay, it doesn't match up."

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:10.433
So let's say that this one had 99 checks

00:04:10.433 --> 00:04:11.533
and then one X.

00:04:11.633 --> 00:04:13.167
Then this would fall
into this category, right

00:04:13.167 --> 00:04:14.166
over here.

00:04:14.166 --> 00:04:17.233
Then this sample, this
sample right over here,

00:04:17.233 --> 00:04:18.433
would correspond ...

00:04:18.433 --> 00:04:19.633
Let me do this in a color.

00:04:19.633 --> 00:04:20.766
So this sample, right over ...

00:04:20.766 --> 00:04:22.133
I mean a new color.

00:04:22.233 --> 00:04:24.300
So this sample right over here would

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:26.666
correlate to, say, this dot.

00:04:27.033 --> 00:04:28.433
And then if they did the test again and

00:04:28.433 --> 00:04:31.433
maybe it got 99 checks and one X,

00:04:31.433 --> 00:04:32.633
then it would be ...

00:04:32.633 --> 00:04:34.533
Say it's number two,
say it would be there.

00:04:35.033 --> 00:04:37.200
Let's say in one of the samples ...

00:04:37.366 --> 00:04:41.767
Let's say in one of the
samples of 100, I guess,

00:04:41.767 --> 00:04:44.500
virtual people right over here, it got ...

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:46.700
You know, there's a 99% chance of getting

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:50.600
a check here, so it got
all 100 people got a check.

00:04:50.901 --> 00:04:52.033
Then that would be ...

00:04:52.033 --> 00:04:54.667
Then it would stack it up right over here.

00:04:55.233 --> 00:04:57.834
And so we see using the
assumption that there's

00:04:57.834 --> 00:05:01.566
a 99% chance of the test matching up,

00:05:01.566 --> 00:05:05.433
or there's a 99% chance
that the test is correct,

00:05:05.433 --> 00:05:08.000
it got all of these results.

00:05:08.233 --> 00:05:10.700
And we see that out of
these 100 samples it took,

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:15.233
none of them, none of
them, gave what Karim

00:05:15.233 --> 00:05:17.000
observed, right over here.

00:05:17.567 --> 00:05:19.966
So it seems like, if you
make this assumption,

00:05:19.966 --> 00:05:22.633
the probability of
observing what he observed

00:05:22.633 --> 00:05:26.667
right over here seems
very, very, very, very low.

00:05:26.966 --> 00:05:30.104
So this, to me or I
guess to any reasonable

00:05:30.104 --> 00:05:32.900
statistician or reasonable
person, these results,

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:35.633
the results he got, the
results that he both observed

00:05:35.633 --> 00:05:38.633
and the results of the simulation tells us

00:05:38.633 --> 00:05:42.901
that the likelihood of
the hypothesis being

00:05:42.901 --> 00:05:45.467
correct is low.

00:05:45.834 --> 00:05:47.100
So this is a ...

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:50.412
The likelihood of the
hypothesis that Karim's test

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:55.233
is correct 99% of the time, the likelihood

00:05:55.233 --> 00:05:57.866
of this hypothesis is very low.

00:05:58.233 --> 00:06:01.633
Very, very, very low.

00:06:01.633 --> 00:06:03.233
Given this observation and the results

00:06:03.233 --> 00:06:04.733
of the simulation.

00:06:04.833 --> 00:06:08.733
And so you'd be likely
to reject the hypothesis.
