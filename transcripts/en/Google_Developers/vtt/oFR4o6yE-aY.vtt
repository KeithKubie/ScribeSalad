JJ BEHRENS: Howdy.

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.910
I'm JJ Behrens and this
is Jarek Wilkiewicz.

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.590
And in the Google Hangout
is Jeffrey Posnick.

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:18.490
And we're here to have our
next episode of YouTube

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:20.528
Developers Live.

00:00:20.528 --> 00:00:21.830
How you guys doing?

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:23.270
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Doing good.

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:24.330
How are you?

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:25.852
JJ BEHRENS: Awesome.

00:00:25.852 --> 00:00:31.495
So Jarek, I was watching the
videos of our talks at Google

00:00:31.495 --> 00:00:35.580
I/O, and I noticed that during
the gaming talk, you were

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:38.360
actually responding to
email while there was

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:39.866
someone else speaking.

00:00:39.866 --> 00:00:43.810
I mean, I've joked about your
connectivity before, but

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:45.190
that's pretty incredible.

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:46.610
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Yes,
I think I am

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:48.695
working on my email addiction.

00:00:48.695 --> 00:00:51.330
I think I have made some
progress on my vacation as we

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:52.780
discussed last time.

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:55.320
I was off the grid for
about five days.

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.515
JJ BEHRENS: Did it hurt?

00:00:56.515 --> 00:00:58.790
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: I had severe
headaches and withdrawal

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:01.740
symptoms, so my effort
has failed.

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:05.080
But I am trying to improve.

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.590
For that particular session,
which we'll cover in more

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.690
detail later on today, we're
actually working through

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:15.410
uploading demos, and I was
checking to see if actually

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:17.100
the demo has uploaded.

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.875
So it wasn't email, per se.

00:01:18.875 --> 00:01:20.537
I was checking the
YouTube out.

00:01:20.537 --> 00:01:21.787
JJ BEHRENS: OK.

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:28.840
No, no, no.

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:29.750
That's to be expected.

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:31.260
That's just who you are.

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:34.150
I've mentioned this
multiple times.

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:37.810
So another surprise secret
hidden guest that we have

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:40.820
today is Amanda Surya,
our boss.

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:44.740
And last week, we had a meeting
with all the people in

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:47.905
Google Developers Live and we
decided that the shows would

00:01:47.905 --> 00:01:53.700
be a lot more interesting if
for every show, the boss of

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.030
the people involved in the show
would come and make faces

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:59.520
just to liven up
the atmosphere.

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.145
So if I start laughing,
yeah, that's why.

00:02:04.145 --> 00:02:06.420
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: We have live
audience, online and offline.

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.166
JJ BEHRENS: Yeah, just
kind of strange.

00:02:10.166 --> 00:02:11.360
JAREK WILKIEWICZ:
No pressure, JJ.

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.510
JJ BEHRENS: Yeah,
I don't know.

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:15.830
So today, we're going
to do an I/O recap.

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:18.580
So we'll talk about all the
things we talked about at I/O,

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:21.190
which you could watch,
after the show--

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:23.230
not before we finish.

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.620
And we're also going to take
office hours questions.

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.320
And Jeffrey will answer those
before you even ask them.

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:32.550
That's what he's good at.

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:36.555
So Jarek, what was the first
talk you want to talk about?

00:02:36.555 --> 00:02:38.910
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: So
we thought about a

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:40.350
good sequence to cover.

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:45.550
And the first one we wanted to
cover is one that recently we

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:47.610
blogged about, about
getting direct

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:49.460
feedback from your community.

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:53.750
So this is a talk that Jeff
and Eric Lundberg did at

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:57.060
Google I/O. So I was thinking
that perhaps Jeff could talk

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:58.780
about it more detail
since he's the

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:00.190
subject domain expert.

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:02.710
And he's really big on getting
feedback from various

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:03.960
communities.

00:03:06.802 --> 00:03:07.760
JEFFREY POSNICK: Sure.

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.020
I wanted to just do
a brief recap.

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:14.270
The videos are online for all
these talks as Jarek said.

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:18.120
So I don't want to re-give my
Google I/O presentation.

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.770
I don't think I have it
memorized by any means, so I

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:22.840
wouldn't be able to
if I wanted to.

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:27.910
But from a very high level,
this Google I/O talk was

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:29.650
basically announcing
two things.

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:31.970
And we actually announced two
things that weren't quite

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:35.340
ready for people to use yet at
Google I/O. But in the week

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.540
since then, we've made them
publicly available.

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:40.876
So as of right now, folks can
go out and try both of these

00:03:40.876 --> 00:03:43.740
things that I'm talking
about, which is great.

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:46.240
So two aspects of the
announcement.

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:49.645
The first was what we're
calling our--

00:03:49.645 --> 00:03:52.160
I guess it's the YouTube
embeddable upload widget.

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:54.280
It's had a couple of different
internal names.

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:57.020
I think that's the one we've
kind of settled on though.

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:01.090
And you can think of this as
something that's very similar

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:03.680
to the YouTube embedded
player.

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:07.410
But instead of allowing you to
embed YouTube playback in your

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:13.270
site, you can embed a way of
capturing YouTube video from

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:15.600
any user's webcam.

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:20.459
And that video then gets
uploaded into that user's

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:22.130
YouTube accounts.

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:25.030
Obviously this is done first
asking the user.

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:27.190
There's consent that
needs to be done.

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:29.240
You have to click some
buttons before

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:31.340
webcam recording starts.

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:32.980
And your user needs
to be logged into

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:34.230
their own YouTube account.

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:37.340
So these videos all go into the

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:38.850
specific end user accounts.

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:40.970
They don't go into one master
YouTube account.

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:43.200
And that's very much in keeping
with our recommended

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:45.160
best practices.

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:47.200
And this is something
we've been hearing

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:49.160
about, I don't know--

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:51.760
I think the original feature
request for this is probably

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:53.670
about four years old.

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:59.550
So we've offered this type of
upload from directly within

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:00.840
YouTube.com.

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:03.390
There's been a page that you
could go to for a while and

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:06.690
record new videos using
your webcam.

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:08.900
There's all sorts of different
types of integration that make

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:11.710
use of being able to put this
on your own page and to

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:15.640
solicit feedback from people
who are viewing your page,

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:18.170
members of your site's
community.

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:20.410
So we're really excited
about the potential

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:23.390
ways of using this.

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:26.900
And in addition to just kind of
the simple way of dropping

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:30.810
in an IFrame on the page that
has the widget, we also have a

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:34.180
nice JavaScript API which is
very similar again to our

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:36.760
YouTube player JavaScript API.

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:40.050
And this lets you do things like
keep track of when the

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:43.920
video has been uploaded and get
back the video ID, which

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:46.780
is useful if you ever want to
curate the videos that have

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:49.270
been submitted.

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:51.110
That's the main integration
point.

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:53.530
There are a few other methods
which we have documented.

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:55.540
JJ BEHRENS: Jeffrey, I
love this feature.

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:58.800
And I'm really, really happy
that we implemented this.

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:01.690
I was really looking forward
to it for a long time.

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:04.610
And I know that you see YouTube
embeds all across the

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:07.410
internet, and we have
an API for embedding

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:08.330
this on your own website.

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:10.940
Do you think we'll start seeing
this widget popping up

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:14.460
in various sites like blogs and
so forth so you can upload

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:16.265
video comments all
across the web?

00:06:16.265 --> 00:06:17.660
JEFFREY POSNICK: I'm
certainly hoping.

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:23.760
So video commenting is one of
the areas that we have kind of

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:25.310
envisioned as being
perfect for this.

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:29.340
And during our Google I/O talk,
we showed off a demo of

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:32.510
very initial integration with
a company called Formspring

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:36.110
which is kind of like a
questions and answer website.

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:39.150
And they hacked something
together for us, and we're

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:41.250
grateful that they were
able to do that.

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:44.600
And it shows how you could
post a question and allow

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:46.870
people to post video responses,
answer your

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:49.570
question, which is just
a whole new level of

00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:51.440
interactivity which is great.

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:53.950
So they're making good use of
the API, and I think you'll be

00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:56.250
able to see that on
your live website

00:06:56.250 --> 00:06:57.740
hopefully before too long.

00:06:57.740 --> 00:06:59.026
We haven't fully rolled
it out yet.

00:06:59.026 --> 00:07:00.500
JJ BEHRENS: That's
pretty awesome.

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:03.270
And you integrated this
into YouTube Direct?

00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:04.120
JEFFREY POSNICK: Yeah.

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:08.160
So the other aspect of the
talk is something that we

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:10.210
announced called YouTube
Direct Lite.

00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:14.120
And I think I've talked about
YouTube Direct at pretty much

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:16.660
every opportunity I've
had in the past.

00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:19.540
And for those who are not
familiar with it, it's a

00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:23.600
platform that's been around for
a while that allows you to

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:28.130
embed a submission widget on a
webpage and that, up until

00:07:28.130 --> 00:07:31.890
now, you could submit videos
either via something stored

00:07:31.890 --> 00:07:35.635
locally on your hard drive or if
you already had a video in

00:07:35.635 --> 00:07:39.340
your YouTube account, you could
say, OK, I want this

00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:41.880
video to be considered
a submission for this

00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:44.070
particular use case.

00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:46.595
One of the common use cases that
we've seen in the past

00:07:46.595 --> 00:07:48.200
are news organizations,
for instance.

00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:50.810
Like a news organization might
say, hey, submit some videos

00:07:50.810 --> 00:07:55.910
related to this tornado that
we just had in this area.

00:07:55.910 --> 00:08:00.230
And folks could do
user-generated content and

00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:01.540
make folks aware of that.

00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:04.600
So that's been around
for a while.

00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:08.070
The existing YouTube Direct
platform was written on Java

00:08:08.070 --> 00:08:08.875
App Engine.

00:08:08.875 --> 00:08:11.990
Kind of required a little bit
of expertise in order to set

00:08:11.990 --> 00:08:13.780
up and deploy properly.

00:08:13.780 --> 00:08:16.620
And we've been hearing for a
long time that folks want

00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:19.150
something that's easier
to deploy, and

00:08:19.150 --> 00:08:20.860
a lot lighter weight.

00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:23.540
And that's what YouTube
Direct Lite is.

00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:26.580
So we were happy to announce
that as well.

00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:27.980
You could start using it
today if you'd like.

00:08:27.980 --> 00:08:32.090
And the basic use case is as
simple as dropping an IFrame

00:08:32.090 --> 00:08:33.600
onto any existing web page.

00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:36.679
And that will let you solicit
videos via a number of

00:08:36.679 --> 00:08:37.679
different mechanisms.

00:08:37.679 --> 00:08:40.820
And one of those mechanisms is
that webcam upload widget.

00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:45.470
So this kind of takes care
of the whole curation and

00:08:45.470 --> 00:08:50.340
moderation use case in which
the webcam widget itself

00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:55.050
doesn't really provide
any method to do.

00:08:55.050 --> 00:08:57.490
The YouTube upload webcam
widget is great

00:08:57.490 --> 00:08:58.250
for soliciting videos.

00:08:58.250 --> 00:09:00.800
But once they've been solicited,
there's no

00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:03.160
interface built in for
moderating those submissions

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:05.180
or keep showing what's
been submitted.

00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:10.210
So YouTube Direct Lite kind of
fills that void, and lets you

00:09:10.210 --> 00:09:12.080
approve any videos that
have been submitted.

00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:14.800
And once they get approved, they
get added to a playlist

00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:17.770
that is hosted in your
own account.

00:09:17.770 --> 00:09:20.520
So it's very easy to feature any
submissions after they've

00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:23.130
been approved and say, hey,
these are the great videos

00:09:23.130 --> 00:09:27.590
that I've had a chance to
review, and I want to share

00:09:27.590 --> 00:09:28.710
with the rest of the world.

00:09:28.710 --> 00:09:30.696
So we're looking forward
to folks using that.

00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:38.070
Full information is available
on a recent blog post on

00:09:38.070 --> 00:09:39.320
apiblog.youtube.com.

00:09:41.210 --> 00:09:43.710
JJ BEHRENS: Yeah, I imagine
adoption is going to be pretty

00:09:43.710 --> 00:09:45.760
good considering the
first step is no

00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:48.680
longer install Eclipse.

00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:50.030
JEFFREY POSNICK: Yeah,
you know what?

00:09:50.030 --> 00:09:54.470
Not having to provide support
for people who are not

00:09:54.470 --> 00:09:57.900
programmers-- and I personally
don't know my way through

00:09:57.900 --> 00:09:59.380
every single aspect
of Eclipse.

00:09:59.380 --> 00:10:03.980
And asking somebody who's not a
developer to do that, it's a

00:10:03.980 --> 00:10:04.910
pretty big burden.

00:10:04.910 --> 00:10:07.671
So I'm really happy that we
could provide something that's

00:10:07.671 --> 00:10:08.186
easier to use.

00:10:08.186 --> 00:10:09.170
JJ BEHRENS: That's
pretty cool.

00:10:09.170 --> 00:10:12.130
So the webcam widget was
definitely a big announcement

00:10:12.130 --> 00:10:15.130
at Google I/O, but we also
announced another thing in our

00:10:15.130 --> 00:10:20.095
next talk which is called new
YouTube Android Player Tools.

00:10:20.095 --> 00:10:21.470
What was that?

00:10:21.470 --> 00:10:23.220
The secret thing that
we were trying to

00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:24.300
keep secret from everyone.

00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:25.020
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Yes.

00:10:25.020 --> 00:10:27.880
So I'm going to have to correct
you because we have

00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:28.510
pre-announced it.

00:10:28.510 --> 00:10:30.800
JJ BEHRENS: Oh, I'm sorry.

00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:34.780
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: And that was
a session by Ross and Anton

00:10:34.780 --> 00:10:38.330
from our mobile engineering
team.

00:10:38.330 --> 00:10:43.910
One of the frequent topics that
we discussed previously

00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:47.970
during our Hangouts was the
process of embedding YouTube

00:10:47.970 --> 00:10:50.190
videos into mobile
applications.

00:10:50.190 --> 00:10:53.370
And whenever a question came up
about it, I would typically

00:10:53.370 --> 00:10:54.830
wave my hands a lot.

00:10:54.830 --> 00:10:57.790
I'd seem quite uncomfortable.

00:10:57.790 --> 00:10:58.980
I would sweat a little bit.

00:10:58.980 --> 00:11:01.350
And then I would try
to address it.

00:11:01.350 --> 00:11:08.100
So with this new API that we
will be launching, these

00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:11.020
questions will become a
lot easier to answer.

00:11:11.020 --> 00:11:14.370
So the fundamental problem we're
solving is, how do we

00:11:14.370 --> 00:11:19.390
reliably embed YouTube
content into native

00:11:19.390 --> 00:11:20.775
applications on Android?

00:11:20.775 --> 00:11:22.960
So if you're an Android
developer, build an Android

00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:25.250
application, and you would
like to incorporate video

00:11:25.250 --> 00:11:29.120
playback, but you do not want
to have what's called an

00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:32.760
out-of-body experience where
you launch a YouTube app or

00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:36.650
you don't want to have to
struggle with web views and

00:11:36.650 --> 00:11:40.440
various limitations of web
views, you can actually use an

00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:45.350
API that we will be launching
which allows you to easily

00:11:45.350 --> 00:11:48.540
incorporate video playback into
your application and have

00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:51.320
a fair amount of control
over that playback.

00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:54.580
So Anton and Ross go into detail
in this session about

00:11:54.580 --> 00:11:58.850
what are the mechanics of
incorporating the API.

00:11:58.850 --> 00:12:02.850
And we also had a few very
interesting demos from our

00:12:02.850 --> 00:12:04.370
early adopters.

00:12:04.370 --> 00:12:08.960
There's a company called Gloto
that presented last week at

00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:10.190
this Hangout.

00:12:10.190 --> 00:12:12.560
So they really target the
advertising space.

00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:16.110
And they were showing how they
can incorporate video playback

00:12:16.110 --> 00:12:20.090
into their app that can be
generated for specific

00:12:20.090 --> 00:12:21.680
marketing campaigns.

00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:24.350
We had a MotorTrend which was
a Google TV application,

00:12:24.350 --> 00:12:26.390
something that I haven't
explicitly mentioned.

00:12:26.390 --> 00:12:29.520
But if you're a Google TV
developer and, again, you want

00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:32.330
to incorporate video playback
in your Google TV app, the

00:12:32.330 --> 00:12:35.580
same API addresses that
problem as well.

00:12:35.580 --> 00:12:39.160
So now you can actually build
second screen experiences or

00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:41.640
beautiful full screen
experiences with YouTube video

00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:45.700
playback around your content
on Google TV.

00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:47.800
So MotorTrend did a
very nice demo.

00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:49.950
And then another company--

00:12:49.950 --> 00:12:52.680
and I don't want to kind
of blow the surprise--

00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:54.410
but let me just tell
you that this was

00:12:54.410 --> 00:12:55.950
really an amazing demo.

00:12:55.950 --> 00:12:58.740
Not so much the application,
which is very beautiful, but

00:12:58.740 --> 00:13:02.750
what they were able to perform
on stage during the demo.

00:13:02.750 --> 00:13:05.980
So I think we came very
close to really

00:13:05.980 --> 00:13:09.075
upending the keynote demo.

00:13:09.075 --> 00:13:10.990
I think it was quite--

00:13:10.990 --> 00:13:12.580
maybe opinions might--

00:13:12.580 --> 00:13:14.160
JJ BEHRENS: It's hard
to compete with guys

00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:15.010
jumping out of blimps.

00:13:15.010 --> 00:13:18.160
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: True, but
I think the co-founder of

00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:19.560
Skimble did pretty good.

00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:23.460
So I really encourage you to
watch this session video.

00:13:23.460 --> 00:13:26.660
The slide deck is linked in
the video description.

00:13:26.660 --> 00:13:29.840
And then as I mentioned, it's
pre-announced, so we haven't

00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:30.970
launched it yet.

00:13:30.970 --> 00:13:34.860
We are however actively seeking
trusted testers.

00:13:34.860 --> 00:13:37.280
So if you're building an
interesting application, reach

00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:42.580
out to us on G+, and we'll see
if we can hook you up and get

00:13:42.580 --> 00:13:45.590
some feedback from you just to
make sure that we really cover

00:13:45.590 --> 00:13:48.800
all the various use cases before
we launch the API.

00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:50.210
So the session was
a lot of fun.

00:13:50.210 --> 00:13:52.870
And I really encourage
you to watch it.

00:13:52.870 --> 00:13:55.670
JJ BEHRENS: I wasn't an Android
developer until we

00:13:55.670 --> 00:13:59.310
came out with this API, and
I had to learn Android as

00:13:59.310 --> 00:14:00.440
quickly as I could.

00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:03.050
But the thing that amazed me
the most is when I built an

00:14:03.050 --> 00:14:08.910
app using this API, I could show
a video and some stuff to

00:14:08.910 --> 00:14:11.720
the right of the video, and then
play the video and then

00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:15.540
have it go full screen and
bounce back without stopping

00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:16.920
playing, without rebuffering.

00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:20.530
Just the smoothness of
moving things around.

00:14:20.530 --> 00:14:21.380
That's pretty new.

00:14:21.380 --> 00:14:22.710
I mean, we couldn't
do that before.

00:14:22.710 --> 00:14:24.410
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Yes, and
another interesting feature--

00:14:24.410 --> 00:14:28.660
and we hear that a lot from
content partners that work

00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:32.240
with us-- is the API actually
has monetization capability.

00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:36.480
So if you have content that is
monetized on YouTube and you

00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:39.020
build, say, a fan app or any
type of app around that

00:14:39.020 --> 00:14:42.930
content, the ads will show and
you will be getting revenue

00:14:42.930 --> 00:14:43.645
from that content.

00:14:43.645 --> 00:14:47.150
So this is something that a
lot of content owners are

00:14:47.150 --> 00:14:49.020
experiencing rapid
growth in mobile.

00:14:49.020 --> 00:14:50.430
And this is something
we covered at

00:14:50.430 --> 00:14:52.100
the session as well.

00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:58.290
And in order to both enjoy the
ride and get paid, this is a

00:14:58.290 --> 00:15:00.730
great solution to that by
incorporating video playback

00:15:00.730 --> 00:15:01.880
using that API.

00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:04.626
The monetization capability
remains as is.

00:15:04.626 --> 00:15:07.140
JJ BEHRENS: I love the way that
you always bring it down

00:15:07.140 --> 00:15:09.910
to the bottom line of helping
our viewers increase their

00:15:09.910 --> 00:15:10.610
bottom line.

00:15:10.610 --> 00:15:11.140
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Show
me the money.

00:15:11.140 --> 00:15:14.170
JJ BEHRENS: Show me the money.

00:15:14.170 --> 00:15:19.730
So the next talk that we had at
I/O was HTML5 at YouTube:

00:15:19.730 --> 00:15:23.580
Stories from the Front Line
by Greg Schechter.

00:15:23.580 --> 00:15:26.570
And that was a fun talk.

00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:31.580
JEFFREY POSNICK: --represent
some of the

00:15:31.580 --> 00:15:32.470
content of the talk.

00:15:32.470 --> 00:15:33.960
I was not one of
the presenters.

00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:38.850
It was Greg Schechter and
Zoltan from our players

00:15:38.850 --> 00:15:39.640
engineering team.

00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:43.090
But I did attend as an
audience member.

00:15:43.090 --> 00:15:45.990
So I could do what I can, but
I would encourage everybody

00:15:45.990 --> 00:15:51.710
also just to watch the video
for a more authoritative

00:15:51.710 --> 00:15:52.720
account of what happened.

00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:56.810
But yeah, Greg and Zoltan were
just talking about some of the

00:15:56.810 --> 00:16:02.350
really interesting types of
integrations that YouTube is

00:16:02.350 --> 00:16:05.020
doing using various things that
kind of fall into the

00:16:05.020 --> 00:16:07.370
HTML5 umbrella.

00:16:07.370 --> 00:16:10.670
The obvious thing being HTML5
video playback, but that's

00:16:10.670 --> 00:16:13.500
kind of old news
at this point.

00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:17.080
We had a talk last year as well
where we announced the

00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:20.850
IFrame embed which will make use
of HTML5 video under some

00:16:20.850 --> 00:16:21.690
circumstances.

00:16:21.690 --> 00:16:25.750
But Greg and Zoltan were going
into some good details about

00:16:25.750 --> 00:16:28.220
things like CSS effects that
they're using for some of the

00:16:28.220 --> 00:16:31.800
controls for the new player,
things that are a little bit

00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:34.500
more advanced than just
video playback.

00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:38.990
I think they were going into
how you could overlay text

00:16:38.990 --> 00:16:42.640
tracks on top of video elements,
make use of some of

00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:45.140
these emerging standards
to have a really

00:16:45.140 --> 00:16:46.920
nice compliant player.

00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:52.140
And some performance just
measurements as well, showing

00:16:52.140 --> 00:16:55.200
the impact of doing different
approaches.

00:16:55.200 --> 00:17:00.020
So that's my very brief
summary of their talk.

00:17:00.020 --> 00:17:02.890
Hopefully, that's enough to whet
some folks' appetite and

00:17:02.890 --> 00:17:04.772
go out and watch the
video yourself.

00:17:04.772 --> 00:17:07.109
JJ BEHRENS: I go to the player
team meetings a lot.

00:17:07.109 --> 00:17:12.470
And the one thing that amazes
me is how closely we follow

00:17:12.470 --> 00:17:13.060
the industry.

00:17:13.060 --> 00:17:15.170
So for instance, we wanted
to go full screen

00:17:15.170 --> 00:17:16.980
with the HTML5 player.

00:17:16.980 --> 00:17:20.369
And Greg's like well, I'm
watching the Firefox guys and

00:17:20.369 --> 00:17:22.980
the Chrome guys and it's going
to be launched at such and

00:17:22.980 --> 00:17:24.230
such a date.

00:17:24.230 --> 00:17:27.240
So it's just like we wait for
the browsers to have support

00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:28.670
and we immediately
start using it.

00:17:28.670 --> 00:17:32.650
It's kind of pretty amazing how
cutting edge that team is.

00:17:35.450 --> 00:17:36.344
No comment.

00:17:36.344 --> 00:17:38.230
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Well, I was
just going to say that I'm

00:17:38.230 --> 00:17:41.170
actually interested to see at
which point we'll be able to

00:17:41.170 --> 00:17:45.810
incorporate HTML5 user media
so that the webcam widget

00:17:45.810 --> 00:17:47.490
actually works with HTML5.

00:17:47.490 --> 00:17:50.780
I think one thing that Jeff
didn't mention is that we

00:17:50.780 --> 00:17:53.910
still require Flash
for the widget.

00:17:53.910 --> 00:17:57.160
So it'll be nice to be able to
address multiple runtime

00:17:57.160 --> 00:17:58.195
environments.

00:17:58.195 --> 00:18:01.190
JEFFREY POSNICK: Yeah, and
that's definitely in Eric--

00:18:01.190 --> 00:18:05.222
Eric, the engineer who wrote
it-- it's in his plans.

00:18:05.222 --> 00:18:09.610
JJ BEHRENS: So the next talk is
a talk that you led, Jarek.

00:18:09.610 --> 00:18:12.560
YouTube API plus Cloud
Rendering equals

00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:14.770
Happy Mobile Gamers.

00:18:14.770 --> 00:18:15.350
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Yes.

00:18:15.350 --> 00:18:20.000
So that talk is more
of a gaming talk.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:24.690
We did a talk last year about
video playback, video uploads

00:18:24.690 --> 00:18:26.740
from console games.

00:18:26.740 --> 00:18:29.695
And our guest speaker was Doug
Muir from Activision.

00:18:29.695 --> 00:18:33.990
We talked about Call of Duty:
Black Ops integration that we

00:18:33.990 --> 00:18:36.350
did with Treyarch, which
is the studio

00:18:36.350 --> 00:18:37.470
that built Black Ops.

00:18:37.470 --> 00:18:40.760
JJ BEHRENS: And that was cool,
but it seems like you went way

00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:42.210
above and beyond this time.

00:18:42.210 --> 00:18:45.600
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Yeah, we
always try to do more.

00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:50.670
And this year, what we wanted to
target is the mobile space.

00:18:50.670 --> 00:18:55.080
As you guys all know, mobile
games are really exploding,

00:18:55.080 --> 00:18:56.420
and everybody's a
mobile gamer.

00:18:56.420 --> 00:18:58.770
In fact, one of the interesting
stats that we

00:18:58.770 --> 00:19:03.690
shared at the session is that
I think in 2014, almost half

00:19:03.690 --> 00:19:05.510
of the US population
is predicted to be

00:19:05.510 --> 00:19:06.670
playing mobile games.

00:19:06.670 --> 00:19:08.950
So that the number is actually
growing quite nicely.

00:19:08.950 --> 00:19:11.644
And then internationally that
trend is even stronger.

00:19:11.644 --> 00:19:14.300
JJ BEHRENS: Yeah, that trend is
definitely pretty strong in

00:19:14.300 --> 00:19:14.850
my household.

00:19:14.850 --> 00:19:16.230
I'm always asking my
wife if she'll

00:19:16.230 --> 00:19:18.560
watch me do these sessions.

00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:22.520
And she's like, I'm sorry, I'd
rather play some mobile games.

00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:25.180
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: So the
question then becomes, how do

00:19:25.180 --> 00:19:28.710
we actually upload videos from
these games, because YouTube

00:19:28.710 --> 00:19:30.030
gaming community
is very strong.

00:19:30.030 --> 00:19:31.830
People share the
gameplay video.

00:19:31.830 --> 00:19:35.350
They show off their
achievements, and they share

00:19:35.350 --> 00:19:37.110
tricks and tips.

00:19:37.110 --> 00:19:39.120
But in the mobile
context, this is

00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:39.960
a little more difficult.

00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:43.050
So what we decided to do is
really show it at several

00:19:43.050 --> 00:19:46.960
different approaches, just to
this problem, starting with

00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:48.930
doing the video rendering
and encoding right

00:19:48.930 --> 00:19:50.750
there on the device.

00:19:50.750 --> 00:19:53.820
Then an approach that we
prototyped and we spoke

00:19:53.820 --> 00:19:56.850
previously at Game Developers
Conference which offloads the

00:19:56.850 --> 00:20:00.260
entire rendering and encoding
process into the cloud.

00:20:00.260 --> 00:20:04.830
We were actually running the
rendering and encoding on top

00:20:04.830 --> 00:20:08.180
of Google Compute Engine except
that the session was on

00:20:08.180 --> 00:20:10.600
Wednesday and the Compute Engine
launched on Thursday,

00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:11.100
so we couldn't--

00:20:11.100 --> 00:20:11.780
JJ BEHRENS: Don't say it.

00:20:11.780 --> 00:20:13.420
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: This
was Compute Engine.

00:20:13.420 --> 00:20:15.270
But now, I can say in
public that it was

00:20:15.270 --> 00:20:16.810
Compute Engine actually.

00:20:16.810 --> 00:20:19.430
I think we have hidden
that pretty well.

00:20:19.430 --> 00:20:21.810
And then so that was kind
of the cloud approach.

00:20:21.810 --> 00:20:24.780
And then there was another
approach that we work with a

00:20:24.780 --> 00:20:28.710
partner on to actually perform
the actual rendering in the

00:20:28.710 --> 00:20:32.430
cloud but do the capture right
there on the device by

00:20:32.430 --> 00:20:35.490
intercepting OpenGL calls.

00:20:35.490 --> 00:20:36.820
So a couple of different
approaches.

00:20:36.820 --> 00:20:38.550
The part that I'm most
excited about is we

00:20:38.550 --> 00:20:39.840
had a special guest.

00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:43.200
And again, just like in the
previous session, we're not

00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:46.800
going to blow the surprise, but
let me just say it was a

00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:55.060
member of a very famous YouTube
partner who publishes

00:20:55.060 --> 00:20:56.650
basketball trick shot videos.

00:20:56.650 --> 00:20:57.840
JJ BEHRENS: Dude,
it was perfect.

00:20:57.840 --> 00:20:59.800
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: It
was quite perfect.

00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:03.480
And I really encourage you
to watch his part of the

00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:04.080
presentation.

00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:07.730
The interesting part that he
covered is if you are a

00:21:07.730 --> 00:21:10.660
content owner and you have a
subscriber base, you can

00:21:10.660 --> 00:21:14.150
actually leverage that
subscriber base to help propel

00:21:14.150 --> 00:21:17.630
your mobile game very
high on the charts.

00:21:17.630 --> 00:21:21.240
So their game actually ended up
being number one on the App

00:21:21.240 --> 00:21:25.260
Store and Google Play after
they launched it, largely

00:21:25.260 --> 00:21:28.690
thanks to a very loyal
following of their

00:21:28.690 --> 00:21:29.930
subscribers.

00:21:29.930 --> 00:21:33.380
So that kind of scalable,
interesting approach is

00:21:33.380 --> 00:21:36.470
traditionally, people invest
in promoting their games by

00:21:36.470 --> 00:21:37.720
advertising and stuff
like that.

00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:40.440
How about creating some
interesting content and then

00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:43.440
using your YouTube audience to
help you promote the game.

00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:45.110
And it has worked for them.

00:21:45.110 --> 00:21:46.380
Very interesting presentation.

00:21:46.380 --> 00:21:48.580
I really encourage
you to watch it.

00:21:48.580 --> 00:21:50.880
JJ BEHRENS: Step
one, go viral.

00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:52.185
Step three, profit.

00:21:52.185 --> 00:21:53.640
JAREK WILKIEWICZ:
Rest is easy.

00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:55.010
JJ BEHRENS: Yeah.

00:21:55.010 --> 00:21:57.820
But I'm also really excited by
another partner that you had

00:21:57.820 --> 00:21:58.490
in that talk.

00:21:58.490 --> 00:22:02.350
You had SummitX Games, the
guys who did Tony Hawk 3.

00:22:02.350 --> 00:22:05.500
And as soon as I heard about
that, I was telling all my

00:22:05.500 --> 00:22:07.150
kids, hey, I'm hanging
out with the guys who

00:22:07.150 --> 00:22:08.760
did Tony Hawk 3.

00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:10.370
That was pretty awesome.

00:22:10.370 --> 00:22:10.890
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Yes.

00:22:10.890 --> 00:22:12.720
They are called Free
Range Games now.

00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:16.330
So it's a studio based here
in northern California.

00:22:16.330 --> 00:22:19.560
Very creative, amazing games.

00:22:19.560 --> 00:22:23.800
And they are sharing their
experience incorporating video

00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:27.830
game play captured to SummitX.

00:22:27.830 --> 00:22:30.980
And this is something that we're
working on with them.

00:22:30.980 --> 00:22:33.860
And then also they shared a
bunch of experiences, kind of

00:22:33.860 --> 00:22:36.330
general mobile design
experiences-- how do you

00:22:36.330 --> 00:22:39.090
design a mobile game, what are
the things to watch out for.

00:22:39.090 --> 00:22:41.630
So kind of lesson learned based
on their experience.

00:22:41.630 --> 00:22:42.960
So very interesting
part as well.

00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:45.480
JJ BEHRENS: And I hate to keep
pushing you, put this talk was

00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:46.160
so awesome.

00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:48.090
Can we talk about the
Unity 3D stuff?

00:22:48.090 --> 00:22:50.300
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Yes.

00:22:50.300 --> 00:22:55.260
What we decided to do is to take
a game engine and try to

00:22:55.260 --> 00:23:00.280
adapt it to include video
uploads capability since it's

00:23:00.280 --> 00:23:03.890
a more scalable model than
trying to ask every game

00:23:03.890 --> 00:23:06.130
developer to build
their own stuff.

00:23:06.130 --> 00:23:10.300
So to that end actually, we
worked with a partner.

00:23:10.300 --> 00:23:13.650
Luminary Studios here, a
Bay Area based company.

00:23:13.650 --> 00:23:16.520
And they were able to basically
build a module that

00:23:16.520 --> 00:23:22.840
plugs into Unity and performs
the video capture and the

00:23:22.840 --> 00:23:27.530
encoding using WebM VP8
and Ogg Vorbis.

00:23:27.530 --> 00:23:33.210
So open source technologies as
far as the media encoding and

00:23:33.210 --> 00:23:39.060
then Unity engine that is
quite popular and quite

00:23:39.060 --> 00:23:42.720
scalable for developers
to build mobile games.

00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:45.660
So we are still working on kind
of finishing, polishing

00:23:45.660 --> 00:23:46.820
that stuff up.

00:23:46.820 --> 00:23:49.470
And we're going to look into how
can we make it available

00:23:49.470 --> 00:23:50.950
for Unity developers.

00:23:50.950 --> 00:23:53.400
And Unity has been a great
sponsor, so I just wanted to

00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:54.070
acknowledge them.

00:23:54.070 --> 00:23:57.290
They helped us a lot along
the way with the process.

00:23:57.290 --> 00:24:01.310
So I think if we could get game
engines to include this

00:24:01.310 --> 00:24:04.350
functionality, then I think
mobile gamers will be quite

00:24:04.350 --> 00:24:08.920
happy because finally, I'll be
able to share my Dude Perfect

00:24:08.920 --> 00:24:14.390
shots and other achievements
that I achieve instead of

00:24:14.390 --> 00:24:17.241
working on YouTube,
which I think that

00:24:17.241 --> 00:24:17.885
would be pretty awesome.

00:24:17.885 --> 00:24:21.060
JJ BEHRENS: I definitely think
in terms of if there was an

00:24:21.060 --> 00:24:25.370
award for coolest talk with most
external partners, with

00:24:25.370 --> 00:24:28.500
most collaboration with external
people, this talk

00:24:28.500 --> 00:24:29.420
would definitely win it.

00:24:29.420 --> 00:24:30.350
It was pretty impressive.

00:24:30.350 --> 00:24:31.070
JAREK WILKIEWICZ:
Thank you, JJ.

00:24:31.070 --> 00:24:32.330
Are you going to
get me coffee?

00:24:32.330 --> 00:24:33.630
JJ BEHRENS: Oh yeah.

00:24:33.630 --> 00:24:37.420
So the next talk we had
was YouTube Channels

00:24:37.420 --> 00:24:38.410
Get With the Program.

00:24:38.410 --> 00:24:41.390
And this was by Dror Shimshowitz
and AJ Crane and

00:24:41.390 --> 00:24:46.200
they're project managers-- no
sorry, product managers.

00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:47.990
I always gets those
two confused.

00:24:47.990 --> 00:24:49.820
And I watched this talk
a couple times.

00:24:49.820 --> 00:24:50.830
It was actually pretty good.

00:24:50.830 --> 00:24:53.650
It was not a super
technical talk.

00:24:53.650 --> 00:24:57.530
But since I spend so much time
working with the YouTube API,

00:24:57.530 --> 00:25:01.520
I don't actually know much about
the rest of the YouTube

00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:04.670
ecosystem such as
how to go viral.

00:25:04.670 --> 00:25:08.150
And they talked a lot about how
to produce good content,

00:25:08.150 --> 00:25:10.810
how to use content for your
business, how to increase

00:25:10.810 --> 00:25:12.640
engagement and so forth.

00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:16.420
And there was some taxidermy
and some--

00:25:16.420 --> 00:25:17.050
nope--

00:25:17.050 --> 00:25:19.900
and a lot of other interesting
things in that talk.

00:25:19.900 --> 00:25:21.510
Did you guys get a
chance to see it?

00:25:21.510 --> 00:25:23.960
Or you guys were probably
pretty busy

00:25:23.960 --> 00:25:24.990
with your own talks.

00:25:24.990 --> 00:25:28.780
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: I watched the
rehearsal, so this is a

00:25:28.780 --> 00:25:31.090
secret that I will share.

00:25:31.090 --> 00:25:33.166
We do rehearse these talks.

00:25:33.166 --> 00:25:34.390
JJ BEHRENS: A couple times.

00:25:34.390 --> 00:25:36.830
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: And it was
quite interesting actually.

00:25:36.830 --> 00:25:39.510
I felt like some of the content
was a little similar

00:25:39.510 --> 00:25:43.380
to your webinar that you did,
YouTube for Your Business.

00:25:43.380 --> 00:25:46.870
But they really focused on all
the different ways in which

00:25:46.870 --> 00:25:49.990
you can create interesting
content and how creating

00:25:49.990 --> 00:25:52.480
content for YouTube is actually
different than for

00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:55.200
kind of traditional media.

00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:58.050
One of the interesting aspects
that they stressed--

00:25:58.050 --> 00:26:02.140
and I've seen that before as
well-- is to make content not

00:26:02.140 --> 00:26:02.920
advertisements.

00:26:02.920 --> 00:26:05.890
So a lot of the YouTube
content-- and you gave an

00:26:05.890 --> 00:26:07.050
example of that.

00:26:07.050 --> 00:26:08.880
It was actually quite
fun to watch.

00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:11.790
So you may not even know that
you're watching an ad, but it

00:26:11.790 --> 00:26:12.825
actually is an ad.

00:26:12.825 --> 00:26:16.240
It's just a YouTube way of
doing it which has proven

00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:19.260
very, very entertaining
and quite successful.

00:26:19.260 --> 00:26:23.050
So one thing that I think that
talk really helps people

00:26:23.050 --> 00:26:25.190
with-- and it kind
of ties back into

00:26:25.190 --> 00:26:26.600
what we talked earlier--

00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:31.060
is if you have a business and
you're an entrepreneur,

00:26:31.060 --> 00:26:33.020
YouTube is a great way to
promote your product.

00:26:33.020 --> 00:26:37.030
And then if you get subscribers,
they give you

00:26:37.030 --> 00:26:40.430
tips about how you actually
build a subscriber base with

00:26:40.430 --> 00:26:41.300
your content.

00:26:41.300 --> 00:26:44.850
Once you have them, they can
actually help you be

00:26:44.850 --> 00:26:45.990
successful with your product.

00:26:45.990 --> 00:26:50.910
So I know all of us here are
developers, but a lot of

00:26:50.910 --> 00:26:53.940
people that we interact with
are entrepreneurs and they

00:26:53.940 --> 00:26:57.300
write code and they also have to
figure out a way to pay the

00:26:57.300 --> 00:26:58.330
bills and be successful.

00:26:58.330 --> 00:27:00.730
So I think considering YouTube
to promote the

00:27:00.730 --> 00:27:02.720
product, it's a good idea.

00:27:02.720 --> 00:27:03.340
But then again, I'm biased.

00:27:03.340 --> 00:27:04.800
JJ BEHRENS: Yeah, well.

00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:07.200
The one thing I've noticed
being at YouTube for long

00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:09.600
enough is that the PMs
are always the ones

00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:11.130
with the best videos.

00:27:11.130 --> 00:27:12.120
I went to that talk.

00:27:12.120 --> 00:27:13.210
It's not technical.

00:27:13.210 --> 00:27:16.680
But my goodness, all those
videos were hilarious.

00:27:16.680 --> 00:27:18.970
And it was like instant
memes, instantly

00:27:18.970 --> 00:27:20.260
forwarding those to my wife.

00:27:20.260 --> 00:27:23.860
I mean they're ads, but
they're so good.

00:27:23.860 --> 00:27:25.135
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: They're
fun, for sure.

00:27:25.135 --> 00:27:27.020
JJ BEHRENS: Good stuff.

00:27:27.020 --> 00:27:31.420
So the next one was Mobile
YouTube API Apps for Content

00:27:31.420 --> 00:27:34.000
Creators, Curators,
and Consumers.

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:36.490
And this was another magic trick
that you pulled together

00:27:36.490 --> 00:27:39.050
with 10 billion external
partners.

00:27:39.050 --> 00:27:39.560
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Yeah.

00:27:39.560 --> 00:27:43.770
So actually we had a three
partners co-presenting.

00:27:43.770 --> 00:27:48.600
And also our product manager
in charge of mobile product

00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:52.540
offering, Andrey Doronichev,
flew in from London for this

00:27:52.540 --> 00:27:53.840
presentation.

00:27:53.840 --> 00:27:59.140
So what we were trying to do is
really help showcase APIs

00:27:59.140 --> 00:28:03.310
that enable content creation,
curation, and consumption on

00:28:03.310 --> 00:28:05.400
YouTube in the mobile context.

00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:10.250
We talked about the history and
the trends that we see on

00:28:10.250 --> 00:28:13.450
YouTube with mobile consumption
and creation.

00:28:13.450 --> 00:28:17.770
Andrey also discussed in some
detail the latest version of

00:28:17.770 --> 00:28:20.620
our YouTube mobile app with
some really exciting

00:28:20.620 --> 00:28:23.830
capabilities, just to kind
of show where we're

00:28:23.830 --> 00:28:25.180
going with the app.

00:28:25.180 --> 00:28:29.330
And then we had demos
from WeVideo.

00:28:29.330 --> 00:28:32.880
And that company builds really
nice creation experiences,

00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:36.920
both traditional HTML-based web

00:28:36.920 --> 00:28:39.440
approach as well as mobile.

00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:42.940
We had 955 Dreams.

00:28:42.940 --> 00:28:47.550
And they built Band of the Day,
History of Jazz, On the

00:28:47.550 --> 00:28:47.950
Way to Woodstock.

00:28:47.950 --> 00:28:50.435
So a lot of very
beautiful apps.

00:28:53.970 --> 00:28:56.770
When I talked to them, they
mentioned that the category

00:28:56.770 --> 00:29:01.420
that they're trying to pursue is
coffee table applications.

00:29:01.420 --> 00:29:04.730
So they're just so pretty that
you can toss away your coffee

00:29:04.730 --> 00:29:07.960
table book and just put the
tablet with the app on your

00:29:07.960 --> 00:29:08.970
coffee table.

00:29:08.970 --> 00:29:11.470
And they talked about how
do you build beautiful

00:29:11.470 --> 00:29:13.110
consumption experience.

00:29:13.110 --> 00:29:18.190
And then finally, last but not
least, some of you that have

00:29:18.190 --> 00:29:21.390
been following some of the
integrations we've been

00:29:21.390 --> 00:29:24.070
working on recently,
we did launch an

00:29:24.070 --> 00:29:25.610
integration with Flipboard.

00:29:25.610 --> 00:29:30.030
So if you're a Flipboard fan,
they have been on iOS for

00:29:30.030 --> 00:29:30.750
quite some time.

00:29:30.750 --> 00:29:34.360
Recently they launched an
Android app integrated with G+

00:29:34.360 --> 00:29:36.350
as well as YouTube.

00:29:36.350 --> 00:29:37.830
So now we can subscribe.

00:29:37.830 --> 00:29:41.640
You can follow your
favorite YouTube

00:29:41.640 --> 00:29:42.850
content creators on Flipboard.

00:29:42.850 --> 00:29:43.650
You could also interact.

00:29:43.650 --> 00:29:46.760
So you can like videos, you
can comment on videos all

00:29:46.760 --> 00:29:48.070
within Flipboard app.

00:29:48.070 --> 00:29:51.490
So they consumed a bunch of our
standard feeds, and they

00:29:51.490 --> 00:29:54.760
integrated the interactivity
into the app as well.

00:29:54.760 --> 00:29:57.890
So they talked about their
experience with the API and

00:29:57.890 --> 00:30:00.260
did a very nice demo on the
tablet and the mobile device.

00:30:00.260 --> 00:30:02.170
So that was a lot of fun.

00:30:02.170 --> 00:30:04.020
Like you said, quite
a few partners.

00:30:04.020 --> 00:30:07.290
That's always tricky to
get it all together.

00:30:07.290 --> 00:30:09.270
But I think it's an interesting
session.

00:30:09.270 --> 00:30:11.480
If you're building mobile
applications and you're

00:30:11.480 --> 00:30:15.150
looking for some hints about how
to include video and some

00:30:15.150 --> 00:30:19.100
best practices, really I think
that that session will be

00:30:19.100 --> 00:30:23.195
valuable because the quality
of the apps that were

00:30:23.195 --> 00:30:24.706
showcased during the session
was quite high.

00:30:24.706 --> 00:30:27.030
JJ BEHRENS: One thing that I
really liked about this talk

00:30:27.030 --> 00:30:31.300
is that you would say, here's
what I'm talking about, either

00:30:31.300 --> 00:30:34.560
curation, creation,
or so forth.

00:30:34.560 --> 00:30:37.660
And then here's an API
and how to do it.

00:30:37.660 --> 00:30:40.430
And then here's this beautiful
app that spent half of its

00:30:40.430 --> 00:30:45.600
time being app of the week
at the Apple App Store.

00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:48.190
It was just such a compelling
experience.

00:30:48.190 --> 00:30:51.350
And those apps were
just beautiful.

00:30:51.350 --> 00:30:53.230
I'm never going to code anything
as beautiful as that.

00:30:53.230 --> 00:30:53.990
Those are just amazing.

00:30:53.990 --> 00:30:56.085
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Keep
trying though, JJ.

00:30:56.085 --> 00:30:58.890
JJ BEHRENS: Yeah, pretty cool.

00:30:58.890 --> 00:31:02.540
And then finally, we had a
Codelab that Jeffrey led

00:31:02.540 --> 00:31:05.370
called Master the Latest
YouTube Data API.

00:31:05.370 --> 00:31:08.130
Tell us about the latest
APIs, the ones

00:31:08.130 --> 00:31:10.036
fresh off the presses.

00:31:10.036 --> 00:31:13.380
JEFFREY POSNICK: I think the
APIs are still kind of on the

00:31:13.380 --> 00:31:18.300
presses being further pressed,
because we do not have

00:31:18.300 --> 00:31:20.776
anything publicly ready
for folks to try yet.

00:31:20.776 --> 00:31:24.100
And I know that's been a source
of frustration for a

00:31:24.100 --> 00:31:25.350
lot of people out there.

00:31:25.350 --> 00:31:27.770
So apologies in advance before
I go into talking about how

00:31:27.770 --> 00:31:31.400
cool these things are.

00:31:31.400 --> 00:31:33.450
So yeah, we had a Codelab.

00:31:33.450 --> 00:31:38.910
And this Codelab was an
introduction to both the new

00:31:38.910 --> 00:31:45.486
version of the YouTube Data API,
which we are calling v3.

00:31:45.486 --> 00:31:49.270
Not the most inspired name,
but technically accurate.

00:31:49.270 --> 00:31:53.460
It is our third major revision
of the data API.

00:31:53.460 --> 00:31:58.120
And this is the first version
that is no longer based on the

00:31:58.120 --> 00:32:00.335
older legacy GData format.

00:32:00.335 --> 00:32:07.380
So GData had a bunch of Atom XML
streams and a whole set of

00:32:07.380 --> 00:32:08.820
infrastructure built
up around this.

00:32:08.820 --> 00:32:12.280
But in the past couple years in
particular, you might have

00:32:12.280 --> 00:32:15.000
noticed that Google has been
migrating to a different type

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:18.930
of back-end infrastructure for
all of our newer APIs.

00:32:18.930 --> 00:32:22.590
And that's the same
infrastructure that the new

00:32:22.590 --> 00:32:23.870
data API is built on.

00:32:23.870 --> 00:32:28.420
So there's a number
of very visible

00:32:28.420 --> 00:32:29.610
changes because of that.

00:32:29.610 --> 00:32:31.870
But there's a number of
very real benefits for

00:32:31.870 --> 00:32:33.410
developers out there.

00:32:33.410 --> 00:32:38.300
Being on this new back-end API
infrastructure means that we

00:32:38.300 --> 00:32:42.520
have a very rich set of client
libraries that are being

00:32:42.520 --> 00:32:46.530
maintained actively by teams
within Google that can be used

00:32:46.530 --> 00:32:51.690
with this new set of
APIs and has native

00:32:51.690 --> 00:32:53.470
support for OAuth 2.

00:32:53.470 --> 00:32:57.440
As I'm sure everyone is aware,
we are strongly encouraging

00:32:57.440 --> 00:33:02.510
everybody to use OAuth 2 with
our even older legacy APIs.

00:33:02.510 --> 00:33:04.910
With the new API, you
have to use OAuth 2.

00:33:04.910 --> 00:33:09.080
There is no more client login,
there's no more AuthSub.

00:33:09.080 --> 00:33:10.160
This is a good thing.

00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:14.106
If you're not sure why, there's
a lot of time you

00:33:14.106 --> 00:33:15.935
could spend talking about OAuth
2 and there's a lot of

00:33:15.935 --> 00:33:17.330
good resources out there
for learning

00:33:17.330 --> 00:33:20.260
as to why it's important.

00:33:20.260 --> 00:33:24.630
So that's going to be a really
big change for developers--

00:33:24.630 --> 00:33:29.610
getting started with having to
basically rewrite a lot of

00:33:29.610 --> 00:33:30.970
existing code.

00:33:30.970 --> 00:33:33.970
And we're kind of taking
it a little bit slow

00:33:33.970 --> 00:33:34.730
with the data API.

00:33:34.730 --> 00:33:39.290
We gave a preview release at
Google I/O to a very limited

00:33:39.290 --> 00:33:40.460
set of people.

00:33:40.460 --> 00:33:42.510
Basically, the only folks who
are currently white listed to

00:33:42.510 --> 00:33:45.070
use the new API are folks that
were in the Codelab that have

00:33:45.070 --> 00:33:49.250
had a chance to sit with us and
more or less one on one

00:33:49.250 --> 00:33:50.870
learn how to use it.

00:33:50.870 --> 00:33:54.370
Not that it's super difficult or
anything like that, but we

00:33:54.370 --> 00:33:58.790
really do want to have a very
small set of developers while

00:33:58.790 --> 00:34:02.010
we're iterating, internally
changing some things around.

00:34:02.010 --> 00:34:05.425
And as soon as we're ready to
publicly release that, we're

00:34:05.425 --> 00:34:07.980
going to remove the white list
and everybody's going to be

00:34:07.980 --> 00:34:08.739
able to use that.

00:34:08.739 --> 00:34:11.090
So that was one of the questions
I saw on our Google

00:34:11.090 --> 00:34:13.830
Moderator Thread-- somebody
asking about when they could

00:34:13.830 --> 00:34:15.470
use that, these new APIs.

00:34:15.470 --> 00:34:20.330
So this is Google, we don't
really give specific ETAs or

00:34:20.330 --> 00:34:21.609
anything like that.

00:34:21.609 --> 00:34:25.500
The answer is sooner rather
than later though.

00:34:25.500 --> 00:34:31.239
We're not anticipating many,
many months to pass before

00:34:31.239 --> 00:34:33.350
this is available, let's say.

00:34:33.350 --> 00:34:37.260
So the actual substance
of the API--

00:34:37.260 --> 00:34:40.320
that was a long-winded way of
describing the background.

00:34:40.320 --> 00:34:44.030
But what we rolled out as part
of the Codelab and what we had

00:34:44.030 --> 00:34:49.969
people test was some of the new
features of the Data API.

00:34:49.969 --> 00:34:53.830
And more interestingly in terms
of new stuff is a brand

00:34:53.830 --> 00:34:55.015
new Analytics API.

00:34:55.015 --> 00:34:56.370
JJ BEHRENS: It's pretty
cool stuff.

00:34:56.370 --> 00:34:58.490
JEFFREY POSNICK: So the docs
for both Data API and

00:34:58.490 --> 00:35:05.420
Analytics API are now live on
developers.google.com/youtube.

00:35:05.420 --> 00:35:07.650
This is kind of taunting folks
who know you can't quite use

00:35:07.650 --> 00:35:09.680
it yet, but you could read
the docs for it.

00:35:09.680 --> 00:35:11.000
So you could see what
it will offer.

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:15.340
And it's a really, really
rich analytics reporting

00:35:15.340 --> 00:35:15.970
experience.

00:35:15.970 --> 00:35:18.720
I'm told that it's very much
modeled on the Google

00:35:18.720 --> 00:35:20.370
Analytics API.

00:35:20.370 --> 00:35:22.860
So if you've done Google
Analytics stuff before, the

00:35:22.860 --> 00:35:26.470
YouTube Analytics API will
apparently be very natural.

00:35:26.470 --> 00:35:29.650
And it gives you a lot more
control than what you could do

00:35:29.650 --> 00:35:34.910
right now using our existing
Insight API, which is what the

00:35:34.910 --> 00:35:39.690
older version of the YouTube
Data API offered.

00:35:39.690 --> 00:35:43.330
Insight API was just really the
ability to download a zip

00:35:43.330 --> 00:35:45.260
archive that had a bunch
of CSV files.

00:35:45.260 --> 00:35:49.710
And while you could write codes
to parse zips and parse

00:35:49.710 --> 00:35:52.240
CSVs and format all your data
around, I don't think anybody

00:35:52.240 --> 00:35:54.810
really looks forward to writing
that kind of code.

00:35:54.810 --> 00:35:58.160
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: I think
they do, Jeff.

00:35:58.160 --> 00:35:59.970
JEFFREY POSNICK: No judging.

00:35:59.970 --> 00:36:01.790
Fair enough.

00:36:01.790 --> 00:36:05.980
So using the YouTube Analytics
API, it's a real RESTful API.

00:36:05.980 --> 00:36:08.820
You just set some report
definitions in your HTTP

00:36:08.820 --> 00:36:13.050
request and you'll get back
either some JSON data directly

00:36:13.050 --> 00:36:16.140
in your HTTP response, or if you
do want your CSV data, you

00:36:16.140 --> 00:36:17.610
could that get that too.

00:36:17.610 --> 00:36:21.970
There are lots of interesting
notes to properly formatting

00:36:21.970 --> 00:36:23.360
your requests--

00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:25.230
the types of ports
that are offered.

00:36:25.230 --> 00:36:29.100
The Analytics API is also
not fully complete yet.

00:36:29.100 --> 00:36:32.130
The engineering team is actively
adding new features.

00:36:32.130 --> 00:36:35.330
So this kind of falls in the
same bucket as the Data API in

00:36:35.330 --> 00:36:38.260
terms of not being able
to use it right now.

00:36:38.260 --> 00:36:41.900
But sooner rather than later,
you should be able to.

00:36:41.900 --> 00:36:45.860
JJ BEHRENS: I know that a lot of
partners have talked to us,

00:36:45.860 --> 00:36:48.220
really interested about this
new Analytics API.

00:36:48.220 --> 00:36:53.260
And I think it's going to open
up a large number of ways

00:36:53.260 --> 00:36:57.230
where we could study why my
videos are not popular.

00:36:57.230 --> 00:37:00.650
But I'm also really excited
about this v3 thing, because

00:37:00.650 --> 00:37:04.030
traditionally, our client
libraries haven't always been

00:37:04.030 --> 00:37:05.180
completely up to date.

00:37:05.180 --> 00:37:09.560
And when we move to v3, we're
going to have really, really

00:37:09.560 --> 00:37:12.280
good client libraries that are
not just going to work for

00:37:12.280 --> 00:37:16.330
YouTube API, but a bunch
of Google APIs.

00:37:16.330 --> 00:37:20.350
I think that that's
really cool.

00:37:20.350 --> 00:37:23.540
And it also helps me with
my ultimate goal.

00:37:23.540 --> 00:37:26.220
If I could port one of those
libraries to Haskell, then I

00:37:26.220 --> 00:37:29.680
could rule the world.

00:37:29.680 --> 00:37:32.410
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: In fact, which
ones were you using at

00:37:32.410 --> 00:37:34.360
the Codelab, Jeff?

00:37:34.360 --> 00:37:37.790
JEFFREY POSNICK: So the Codelab,
we focused on Python

00:37:37.790 --> 00:37:39.300
and JavaScript.

00:37:39.300 --> 00:37:44.100
And we actually have, as part
of the public Analytics API

00:37:44.100 --> 00:37:48.450
docs, more or less an
adapted version of

00:37:48.450 --> 00:37:50.460
the JavaScript Codelab.

00:37:50.460 --> 00:37:52.790
So you could see
that publicly.

00:37:52.790 --> 00:37:55.440
We're probably going to also
repackage it and turn it into

00:37:55.440 --> 00:37:58.900
a Google Developers Academy
course once

00:37:58.900 --> 00:38:00.730
it is actually available.

00:38:00.730 --> 00:38:03.920
So yeah, we're kind of in an
interesting mode right now.

00:38:03.920 --> 00:38:06.880
We're going to have some cool
things launching, and we want

00:38:06.880 --> 00:38:09.270
to make sure there's as much
good sample code out there for

00:38:09.270 --> 00:38:13.280
developers as possible because
you are going to have to do

00:38:13.280 --> 00:38:15.600
some rewrites if you
have some existing

00:38:15.600 --> 00:38:17.920
legacy YouTube API code.

00:38:17.920 --> 00:38:20.990
So we want to make that as easy
as possible for everyone.

00:38:20.990 --> 00:38:24.100
JJ BEHRENS: Well, Google I/O
was a big hit this year.

00:38:24.100 --> 00:38:25.850
I mean, it was like
big attendance.

00:38:25.850 --> 00:38:29.230
But more than that, we had
a lot of YouTube talks.

00:38:29.230 --> 00:38:31.130
I don't think we had that
many last year.

00:38:31.130 --> 00:38:31.990
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Yeah,
I think that was

00:38:31.990 --> 00:38:32.860
our record to date.

00:38:32.860 --> 00:38:36.800
So I think if that trend
continues, I think by 2015,

00:38:36.800 --> 00:38:39.090
Google I/O will be about
YouTube entirely.

00:38:39.090 --> 00:38:41.375
That will be the only topic
that we'll cover.

00:38:41.375 --> 00:38:44.010
JJ BEHRENS: We'll have to tell
the Android guys about that.

00:38:44.010 --> 00:38:44.990
It's pretty awesome though.

00:38:44.990 --> 00:38:47.180
I'm excited about that.

00:38:47.180 --> 00:38:50.680
And so of course, you don't have
to just listen to us talk

00:38:50.680 --> 00:38:51.380
about those talks.

00:38:51.380 --> 00:38:52.520
You could watch those
talks now.

00:38:52.520 --> 00:38:55.750
And I encourage you to do so
if you want to learn more

00:38:55.750 --> 00:38:58.960
about any of these
specific topics.

00:38:58.960 --> 00:39:00.580
Why don't we answer some
questions now?

00:39:00.580 --> 00:39:02.590
What do we got going on in
the moderation queue?

00:39:06.170 --> 00:39:08.110
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Think
there's one question.

00:39:08.110 --> 00:39:11.720
I think Jeff referred
to that one already.

00:39:11.720 --> 00:39:17.520
It was about YouTube API
Analytics access.

00:39:17.520 --> 00:39:19.880
So this is a v3 question.

00:39:19.880 --> 00:39:24.330
JEFFREY POSNICK: So again, there
are links that anybody

00:39:24.330 --> 00:39:27.300
could go to, to fill out a form
and attempt to apply for

00:39:27.300 --> 00:39:29.850
access to these APIs.

00:39:29.850 --> 00:39:33.090
It's a little unfortunate that
we can't, as part of that

00:39:33.090 --> 00:39:38.850
signup process, give you more
feedback as to if or when

00:39:38.850 --> 00:39:41.150
you're going to be approved.

00:39:41.150 --> 00:39:45.870
Basically the only folks who
have really been approved

00:39:45.870 --> 00:39:49.090
right now are the folks who've
been part of the Codelab.

00:39:49.090 --> 00:39:52.100
And as soon as we have
something that

00:39:52.100 --> 00:39:53.350
is a lot more stable--

00:39:53.350 --> 00:39:56.530
I don't think we're really at
the point where you really can

00:39:56.530 --> 00:40:00.800
build anything that is not going
to break one week later

00:40:00.800 --> 00:40:02.250
when the next push happens.

00:40:02.250 --> 00:40:04.940
So it's not like you're
missing out too much.

00:40:04.940 --> 00:40:07.420
And we're going to open up to as
many people as we can once

00:40:07.420 --> 00:40:10.811
we have something stable that
we could do that with.

00:40:10.811 --> 00:40:15.460
JJ BEHRENS: So after Google
I/O happened, a lot of

00:40:15.460 --> 00:40:17.960
Googlers, developer advocates,
and developer programs

00:40:17.960 --> 00:40:21.200
engineers, tend to just
collapse because

00:40:21.200 --> 00:40:23.000
it's kind of busy.

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:24.740
But Jarek had another idea.

00:40:24.740 --> 00:40:29.180
And he decided that he and I
should fly across the world to

00:40:29.180 --> 00:40:33.930
London and give a YouTube player
API, Google TV, Mobile

00:40:33.930 --> 00:40:35.230
Something Hack-a-Thon.

00:40:35.230 --> 00:40:36.760
You want to talk about that?

00:40:36.760 --> 00:40:38.730
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Yes, that
was a final push actually.

00:40:38.730 --> 00:40:41.480
When I was little younger,
I used to run marathons.

00:40:41.480 --> 00:40:43.180
And this is pretty much
how you do it.

00:40:43.180 --> 00:40:45.880
You work really hard and then
you work even harder on the

00:40:45.880 --> 00:40:47.870
last couple of miles.

00:40:47.870 --> 00:40:51.920
So yes, we did have an
interesting event in London.

00:40:51.920 --> 00:40:56.970
There was a weekend event on
a London campus, which is a

00:40:56.970 --> 00:40:59.460
really great venue and
an awesome resource.

00:40:59.460 --> 00:41:02.740
If you are UK-based, then
I really encourage

00:41:02.740 --> 00:41:05.120
you to check it out.

00:41:05.120 --> 00:41:07.890
Just a wonderful community
building around it.

00:41:07.890 --> 00:41:12.575
The person that runs it,
[INAUDIBLE], is really an

00:41:12.575 --> 00:41:15.130
interesting character, very
committed and passionate about

00:41:15.130 --> 00:41:16.900
entrepreneurs in general.

00:41:16.900 --> 00:41:17.820
So it's a great resource.

00:41:17.820 --> 00:41:19.180
So we thought about
trying it out.

00:41:19.180 --> 00:41:22.560
And we invited a
bunch of folks.

00:41:22.560 --> 00:41:27.680
We had about 18 applications
built by Sunday night.

00:41:27.680 --> 00:41:30.630
So really nice set
of applications.

00:41:30.630 --> 00:41:33.070
Quite high quality apps.

00:41:33.070 --> 00:41:36.580
And we were quite amazed how
quickly people were able to

00:41:36.580 --> 00:41:39.790
build interesting applications
with Android Player API.

00:41:39.790 --> 00:41:41.680
And there were different
categories.

00:41:41.680 --> 00:41:43.705
I think we had five winners.

00:41:43.705 --> 00:41:47.580
We had some prizes, and all
the free pizza I can eat.

00:41:47.580 --> 00:41:48.620
JJ BEHRENS: And beer.

00:41:48.620 --> 00:41:49.960
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: So I
think it was quite

00:41:49.960 --> 00:41:50.700
a successful event.

00:41:50.700 --> 00:41:53.140
We hopefully will
do more of that.

00:41:53.140 --> 00:41:55.940
And we got some really
good feedback.

00:41:55.940 --> 00:41:58.960
Some of the interesting
applications that I thought

00:41:58.960 --> 00:42:01.270
were fun were kind of second
screen applications.

00:42:01.270 --> 00:42:05.640
So Mobile Plus, Google TV
Tablet, and Google TV.

00:42:05.640 --> 00:42:10.163
We had one interesting company
that was basically a

00:42:10.163 --> 00:42:13.320
co-founder came to the Friday
night kickoff session with an

00:42:13.320 --> 00:42:16.220
idea about building interesting
experience around

00:42:16.220 --> 00:42:18.040
the content that they're
going to be producing.

00:42:18.040 --> 00:42:21.260
So not the developer, but rather
a content owner or

00:42:21.260 --> 00:42:23.080
somebody who wants to
start a network.

00:42:23.080 --> 00:42:26.240
And was able to attract a couple
of developers to work

00:42:26.240 --> 00:42:27.010
on the idea.

00:42:27.010 --> 00:42:30.470
And by Sunday night, they had a
working demo of interesting

00:42:30.470 --> 00:42:33.070
mobile experience and TV
experience around the content

00:42:33.070 --> 00:42:33.950
that they'll be producing.

00:42:33.950 --> 00:42:37.770
So really kind of helps with
the point that if you're

00:42:37.770 --> 00:42:41.320
building content and you want
to have some additional

00:42:41.320 --> 00:42:45.140
value-add or referrals to your
own content, the type of

00:42:45.140 --> 00:42:48.570
experience you want, you could
still do that by syndicating

00:42:48.570 --> 00:42:50.910
to YouTube, but then building
out the experience the way you

00:42:50.910 --> 00:42:53.940
want it, not the way we want
people to consume media

00:42:53.940 --> 00:42:57.740
content, because there's many
ways to skin the cat.

00:42:57.740 --> 00:43:01.060
And then because of the
value-add that people include

00:43:01.060 --> 00:43:04.500
additional content like
[INAUDIBLE] or whatnot in

00:43:04.500 --> 00:43:07.440
their overall experience, it was
kind of a great story, so

00:43:07.440 --> 00:43:09.160
we really liked that.

00:43:09.160 --> 00:43:10.770
So lots of interesting ideas.

00:43:10.770 --> 00:43:12.310
JJ BEHRENS: That was
a beautiful demo.

00:43:12.310 --> 00:43:16.930
But my favorite was when they
had one of the contestants

00:43:16.930 --> 00:43:21.180
entered an app where it's
playing a playlist on a Google

00:43:21.180 --> 00:43:24.780
TV, and then people could gather
around the TV with

00:43:24.780 --> 00:43:26.090
their Android phones--

00:43:26.090 --> 00:43:27.710
and let me pull one out.

00:43:27.710 --> 00:43:32.390
And if you don't like the video,
you point your phone

00:43:32.390 --> 00:43:34.380
kind of at the TV and
you tilt it up.

00:43:34.380 --> 00:43:37.440
And it's like reading
the accelerometer to

00:43:37.440 --> 00:43:38.330
figure out your tilt.

00:43:38.330 --> 00:43:41.490
And if you don't like it, you
pull back like a slingshot and

00:43:41.490 --> 00:43:42.110
then let go.

00:43:42.110 --> 00:43:46.230
And it flings a virtual tomato
at the screen and it explodes

00:43:46.230 --> 00:43:47.290
on the screen.

00:43:47.290 --> 00:43:51.900
And if enough tomatoes hit the
video, then the video gets

00:43:51.900 --> 00:43:54.590
taken down, and the next one
played in the playlist.

00:43:54.590 --> 00:43:55.540
That was pretty amazing.

00:43:55.540 --> 00:43:58.050
There's Android here, there's
Google TV, there's like

00:43:58.050 --> 00:44:00.000
accelerometer type
stuff, there's

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:01.670
second screen type stuff.

00:44:01.670 --> 00:44:02.815
That was a pretty
amazing demo.

00:44:02.815 --> 00:44:03.820
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: It
was really fun.

00:44:03.820 --> 00:44:07.190
And one thing that I wanted to
mention is we were quite lucky

00:44:07.190 --> 00:44:11.810
we were able to get quite a few
Googlers to the event and

00:44:11.810 --> 00:44:15.060
sit there with the developers
for the whole weekend.

00:44:15.060 --> 00:44:17.860
So that was one of the teams
that had attracted quite a few

00:44:17.860 --> 00:44:20.010
Googlers helping out.

00:44:20.010 --> 00:44:22.390
Really awesome demo.

00:44:22.390 --> 00:44:24.610
JJ BEHRENS: Any other apps that
you can remember that you

00:44:24.610 --> 00:44:25.740
particularly liked?

00:44:25.740 --> 00:44:28.390
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: One that was
interesting and won an

00:44:28.390 --> 00:44:31.640
honorable mention was an app
that basically teaches you how

00:44:31.640 --> 00:44:34.500
to do various things
on your phone.

00:44:34.500 --> 00:44:37.390
So this is kind of the missing
manual problem.

00:44:37.390 --> 00:44:40.640
And what they would do is record
videos about various

00:44:40.640 --> 00:44:44.785
phone functions and then build
an app around that experience.

00:44:44.785 --> 00:44:49.340
So it's kind of help, but it's
video help for your phone that

00:44:49.340 --> 00:44:50.990
comes with your phone.

00:44:50.990 --> 00:44:53.740
So they came up with the idea
and they pitched it.

00:44:53.740 --> 00:44:56.840
They were able to build a
prototype at that event.

00:44:56.840 --> 00:44:58.200
And they'll be moving
forward with it.

00:44:58.200 --> 00:45:00.360
So that was a cool
little project.

00:45:00.360 --> 00:45:01.670
JJ BEHRENS: That was
pretty cool.

00:45:01.670 --> 00:45:05.500
It amazed me just how many
people were doing second

00:45:05.500 --> 00:45:07.720
screen type stuff
with Google TV.

00:45:07.720 --> 00:45:11.570
I think that second screen is
going to be a hot topic.

00:45:11.570 --> 00:45:12.600
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: So which
one is second,

00:45:12.600 --> 00:45:14.560
the TV or the mobile?

00:45:14.560 --> 00:45:18.020
JJ BEHRENS: For me, I think
that might be a personal

00:45:18.020 --> 00:45:19.270
preference.

00:45:21.090 --> 00:45:23.850
So anything else?

00:45:23.850 --> 00:45:26.220
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: I thought
maybe it might make sense for

00:45:26.220 --> 00:45:30.740
Jeff to talk a little bit
about some of the API

00:45:30.740 --> 00:45:32.960
additions that we
made recently.

00:45:32.960 --> 00:45:35.890
I know he's been busy posting
to news groups and

00:45:35.890 --> 00:45:37.970
anticipating people's questions
about them as he

00:45:37.970 --> 00:45:39.240
always does.

00:45:39.240 --> 00:45:40.630
So Jeff, what do you think?

00:45:40.630 --> 00:45:43.160
Any updates on the recent
launches that people

00:45:43.160 --> 00:45:44.602
should be aware of?

00:45:44.602 --> 00:45:45.350
JEFFREY POSNICK: Sure.

00:45:45.350 --> 00:45:49.230
There are a couple of recent
changes, one of which is

00:45:49.230 --> 00:45:52.160
captured in a blog post that
went up yesterday talking

00:45:52.160 --> 00:45:57.250
about the new
getVideoLoadedFraction method

00:45:57.250 --> 00:45:59.460
that is now part of
the Player API.

00:45:59.460 --> 00:46:04.270
And this is something that
supersedes and more or less

00:46:04.270 --> 00:46:07.695
deprecates two other methods
that had existed for a while

00:46:07.695 --> 00:46:09.550
called getVideoBytesLoaded
and getVideoBytesTotal.

00:46:12.210 --> 00:46:15.450
Pretty much what we saw was that
the way people would use

00:46:15.450 --> 00:46:18.550
getVideoBytesLoaded and
getVideoBytesTotal was just by

00:46:18.550 --> 00:46:22.830
doing a division, by getting the
total number of bytes in

00:46:22.830 --> 00:46:28.282
the video and dividing that into
the number of bytes that

00:46:28.282 --> 00:46:30.650
are loaded to try to figure out
how much of a video has

00:46:30.650 --> 00:46:31.950
already been offered.

00:46:31.950 --> 00:46:35.910
And then they were using that
information to display a

00:46:35.910 --> 00:46:40.190
buffer bar in their own custom
playback experience.

00:46:40.190 --> 00:46:44.590
So we kind of removed the need
to do that division by having

00:46:44.590 --> 00:46:47.290
one method that will return
that fraction for you

00:46:47.290 --> 00:46:48.680
automatically.

00:46:48.680 --> 00:46:52.240
So if you had 50% of the video
that's already been buffered,

00:46:52.240 --> 00:46:55.653
getVideoLoadedFraction will
return 0.5 of it, and you

00:46:55.653 --> 00:46:58.080
could use that directly from
in your application.

00:46:58.080 --> 00:47:01.090
This is also nice because there
are some scenarios such

00:47:01.090 --> 00:47:04.840
as when HTML5 video playback
is being used where we were

00:47:04.840 --> 00:47:07.480
never able to actually return
an accurate count of the

00:47:07.480 --> 00:47:12.020
number of bytes that were
available just to [INAUDIBLE]

00:47:12.020 --> 00:47:13.990
HTML5 video element worked.

00:47:13.990 --> 00:47:16.690
So we always had to kind of
return this approximation that

00:47:16.690 --> 00:47:21.170
didn't really make sense
as a byte count anyway.

00:47:21.170 --> 00:47:25.610
So we're kind of doing away with
the pretension that these

00:47:25.610 --> 00:47:27.060
things are bytes that
were returning.

00:47:27.060 --> 00:47:28.182
We're just giving you
a fraction that

00:47:28.182 --> 00:47:29.900
you could use yourself.

00:47:29.900 --> 00:47:32.520
So we have a standard
deprecation policy.

00:47:32.520 --> 00:47:37.420
And the getVideoBytesLoaded and
getVideoBytesTotal method

00:47:37.420 --> 00:47:41.130
are not going away today
or anything like that.

00:47:41.130 --> 00:47:43.630
But do consider them officially
deprecated.

00:47:43.630 --> 00:47:44.580
Try moving on to

00:47:44.580 --> 00:47:45.880
getVideoLoadedFraction instead.

00:47:45.880 --> 00:47:46.740
JJ BEHRENS: That's great.

00:47:46.740 --> 00:47:49.200
JEFFREY POSNICK:
We also have--

00:47:49.200 --> 00:47:51.300
something we would not blog
about, but it's just come up

00:47:51.300 --> 00:47:54.780
at least in forum once or twice,
and I know that Jarek's

00:47:54.780 --> 00:47:58.730
been getting some questions
about it too, which is one of

00:47:58.730 --> 00:48:01.930
our standard views that
we'd make available as

00:48:01.930 --> 00:48:03.910
part of the Data API.

00:48:03.910 --> 00:48:07.350
And this is a feed of videos
that we refer to as

00:48:07.350 --> 00:48:08.730
most_viewed.

00:48:08.730 --> 00:48:12.750
So that's most underscore
viewed.

00:48:12.750 --> 00:48:15.100
For a while now, we haven't
really been populating that

00:48:15.100 --> 00:48:18.050
with anything meaningful.

00:48:18.050 --> 00:48:21.080
There are a number of reasons
why that's been the case.

00:48:21.080 --> 00:48:23.350
JJ BEHRENS: Is that because like
the Tommy Bit My Finger

00:48:23.350 --> 00:48:28.685
just can never be replaced in
terms of number of views?

00:48:28.685 --> 00:48:30.250
JEFFREY POSNICK: Yes.

00:48:30.250 --> 00:48:33.840
I'm going to go with
JJ's explanation.

00:48:33.840 --> 00:48:38.150
The basic thrust of this though
is that most_viewed is

00:48:38.150 --> 00:48:40.490
not going to be updated
moving forward.

00:48:40.490 --> 00:48:44.270
And we're recommending that
folks no longer use that.

00:48:44.270 --> 00:48:48.210
If you're looking for a feed
of videos to use that will,

00:48:48.210 --> 00:48:50.520
for instance, highlight things
that are really popular on

00:48:50.520 --> 00:48:55.950
YouTube, the aptly named most
underscore popular video feed

00:48:55.950 --> 00:48:59.090
is a great feed to use
for that purpose.

00:48:59.090 --> 00:49:00.640
That's going to continue
to be updated.

00:49:00.640 --> 00:49:03.630
And it's a great way to pull
in interesting content into

00:49:03.630 --> 00:49:07.970
your application if you want to
surface whatever's trending

00:49:07.970 --> 00:49:09.695
on YouTube right now.

00:49:09.695 --> 00:49:11.817
So we recommend folks
to use that instead.

00:49:14.799 --> 00:49:15.710
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: All right.

00:49:15.710 --> 00:49:17.280
JJ BEHRENS: Well, that
was a great session.

00:49:17.280 --> 00:49:20.430
Thank you very much Jeffrey
and great set

00:49:20.430 --> 00:49:21.800
of Google I/O talks.

00:49:21.800 --> 00:49:23.690
Thanks for joining us here.

00:49:23.690 --> 00:49:25.810
And we will see-- it seems like
we're going to move to

00:49:25.810 --> 00:49:27.452
every week now.

00:49:27.452 --> 00:49:29.320
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: We're going
to do every week and then I

00:49:29.320 --> 00:49:32.350
think Jeff wants to do
every day, but we're

00:49:32.350 --> 00:49:33.730
pushing back right now.

00:49:33.730 --> 00:49:35.180
I'm not sure we're
ready for that.

00:49:35.180 --> 00:49:36.980
JJ BEHRENS: Dammit, and
we're doing it live.

00:49:36.980 --> 00:49:38.230
We'll do it live.

00:49:42.040 --> 00:49:43.490
OK, thanks a lot guys.

00:49:43.490 --> 00:49:43.950
Take care.

00:49:43.950 --> 00:49:44.500
JEFFREY POSNICK:
Bye everybody.

00:49:44.500 --> 00:49:45.750
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Bye.

00:49:50.200 --> 00:50:02.800
