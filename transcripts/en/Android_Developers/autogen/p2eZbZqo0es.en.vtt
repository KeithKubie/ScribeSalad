00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.912
 [MUSIC PLAY] 

00:00:09.484 --> 00:00:10.900
 JONATHAN MCNULTY: Trulia's mission 

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:12.120
 is to make it as easy as possible 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:13.786
 for you to find the home of your dreams. 

00:00:13.786 --> 00:00:16.160
 Trulia works with MLS across the United States 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.885
 to bring in an incredible amount of data for available properties. 

00:00:18.885 --> 00:00:20.620
 LAUREN HIRASHIMA: Trulia's purpose, in fact, 

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:23.466
 is to assist you in your search for a home. 

00:00:23.466 --> 00:00:25.840
 JONATHAN MCNULTY: So far, Trulia has done incredibly well. 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:27.660
 In fact, we see more than half of our business now 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.060
 on mobile applications. 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:31.220
 So when we think of products in the future, 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:33.440
 when we think about how we can serve our users, 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:34.960
 which is really more than anything else 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:36.240
 mobile applications are all 

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:37.810
 what we do very much on mobile devices. 

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:39.800
 Android gives us a lot of flexibility 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.136
 to embed new and creative features for our users. 

00:00:42.136 --> 00:00:43.510
 LAUREN HIRASHIMA: Android has it for us 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:45.920
 made it possible to create a much more stable program 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.040
 and also to be able to repeat much faster. 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:52.490
 Innovation is at the heart of Trulia's being. 

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:56.025
 And we love innovation as the core of Google 

00:00:56.025 --> 00:00:56.525
 being. 

00:00:56.525 --> 00:00:57.983
 JONATHAN MCNULTY: We have every quarter 

00:00:57.983 --> 00:01:00.502
 a week dedicated to engineering product design 

00:01:00.502 --> 00:01:02.460
 To really focus on what they think is important. 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.126
 We saw our forwarding notification system. 

00:01:04.126 --> 00:01:05.470
 We've seen our mobile apps. 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:07.250
 We've seen many of the programs that you live today 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:08.750
 on the site, from our innovation weeks. 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:10.666
 LAUREN HIRASHIMA: After submitting the forwarding notifications 

00:01:10.666 --> 00:01:12.560
 turned on Android, 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.880
 we have seen an immediate impact. 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.980
 We learned and did it 

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:20.370
 and then saw a 30% increase in involvement. 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:23.180
 And Android engagement is twice as high 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:24.540
 as on our other platforms. 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.090
 We initially saw a number of complaints 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.340
 when we sent too many notifications. 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.010
 Therefore, we quickly responded and realized 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:37.090
 that there is an ideal target for the number of notifications 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:39.030
 what you need to send to your users one day. 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.632
 JONATHAN MCNULTY: We recently launched notices for nearby homes. 

00:01:40.632 --> 00:01:42.510
 It actually uses a wall-mounted technology 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:43.900
 with which Google empowered us. 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:45.775
 LAUREN HIRASHIMA: Just say you walk with your dog 

00:01:45.775 --> 00:01:47.770
 and you're close to a new listing. 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:48.830
 Then you will receive an alert. 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:51.530
 You can just get the alert on your watch, 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:53.840
 see high-level details about the property, 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.420
 roles through a few photos and the agent call or email 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.900
 send directly to the agent from your watch. 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:02.660
 It was very easy to develop for Android Wear. 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:05.890
 It took an engineer a few weeks 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:08.110
 to have our program live on Google Play. 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:11.980
 We see more action coming from our Android platform 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:13.390
 off any other platform. 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:16.960
 We partnered with Google 

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:20.090
 regarding these new products and new platforms 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:23.680
 and value both companies.
