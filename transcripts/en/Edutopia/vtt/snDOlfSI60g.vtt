00:00:11.086 --> 00:00:11.756
&gt;&gt;My name is Luis.

00:00:12.116 --> 00:00:13.006
I'm eighteen years old.

00:00:13.006 --> 00:00:14.366
I live in Cornelius, Oregon.

00:00:17.986 --> 00:00:21.726
&gt;&gt;Luis: I really enjoy technology,
because it's a better way to connect

00:00:21.806 --> 00:00:24.236
with families, connect with friends,

00:00:24.856 --> 00:00:27.966
better way to help me improve
my studies, better way to find

00:00:27.966 --> 00:00:29.826
out information and
use that information

00:00:29.826 --> 00:00:30.936
for the community,
not just for myself.

00:00:40.046 --> 00:00:43.496
&gt;&gt;Luis: In the morning, I
wake up around five thirty.

00:00:43.946 --> 00:00:48.726
I usually turn on the computer,
check email just really quick,

00:00:49.546 --> 00:00:51.136
go downstairs, have breakfast.

00:00:51.736 --> 00:00:53.836
Wake up my brother, make sure
he gets ready for school.

00:00:54.386 --> 00:00:57.336
We would go out the door maybe
around seven twenty in the morning.

00:00:57.866 --> 00:01:03.046
I drop him off at school
and then I go to school.

00:01:03.456 --> 00:01:05.356
I'm taking the four AP classes,

00:01:05.356 --> 00:01:07.406
advanced placement
classes, in one day.

00:01:07.406 --> 00:01:09.686
&gt;&gt;Teacher: -- it shows,
the taller the bar,

00:01:09.686 --> 00:01:12.916
the more frequent it happened.

00:01:12.986 --> 00:01:16.256
&gt;&gt;Luis: Basically, when I get home,
right away I'm checking my Gmail

00:01:16.256 --> 00:01:22.406
and this is the one
I use for friends.

00:01:22.406 --> 00:01:25.836
So then after this, it's social
networking, so I go to Facebook,

00:01:26.596 --> 00:01:29.076
check what my friends are doing.

00:01:29.106 --> 00:01:32.206
My friend Ellie, she's become
a fan of Cheez-Its, apparently.

00:01:32.606 --> 00:01:35.976
If a friend's online, I can
start chatting with them.

00:01:36.656 --> 00:01:38.436
If you're just instant messaging.

00:01:38.776 --> 00:01:40.656
&gt;&gt;You could be writing a
paper here and then chatting

00:01:40.656 --> 00:01:41.946
with your friends at the same time.

00:01:42.656 --> 00:01:46.706
&gt;&gt;So that's definitely good for
connecting with people and not just

00:01:46.836 --> 00:01:49.686
through like old fashioned
ways like letters or telephone.

00:01:49.686 --> 00:01:51.686
&gt;&gt;Go to CNET dot com.

00:01:52.216 --> 00:01:54.696
So naturally they have how-to videos
and this is where I learn a lot

00:01:54.696 --> 00:01:58.386
about computers and installing
different operating systems.

00:01:58.596 --> 00:02:01.246
I also spend a lot
of time on YouTube.

00:02:02.736 --> 00:02:06.916
This video, we made it for fun and my
little brother and I would just like,

00:02:07.146 --> 00:02:09.506
whenever we had really
nothing to do, I'm like,

00:02:09.506 --> 00:02:15.086
"Why don't you start dancing like
a robot and see how that looks?"

00:02:15.256 --> 00:02:17.426
&gt;&gt;It's pretty funny.

00:02:17.426 --> 00:02:18.286
&gt;&gt;Luis: [speaking Spanish].

00:02:18.286 --> 00:02:18.416
&gt;&gt;Mom: Okay.

00:02:18.916 --> 00:02:22.816
&gt;&gt;Luis: Both my mom and my
dad are from a state in Mexico

00:02:22.816 --> 00:02:23.956
by the name of Michoacan.

00:02:24.296 --> 00:02:28.626
They both came here as just rural
immigrants, looking for jobs,

00:02:29.056 --> 00:02:30.206
looking for a place to work.

00:02:30.836 --> 00:02:33.426
&gt;&gt;Lucy: Luis, he's kinda
quiet guy, reserved,

00:02:33.426 --> 00:02:35.256
but you can tell he's thinking a lot.

00:02:35.696 --> 00:02:37.196
He's a good son.

00:02:37.436 --> 00:02:40.516
And when I saw that he picks up
his brother, his mom and does--

00:02:40.806 --> 00:02:44.056
helps her out with all these things,
you know, I as a mother think, "Wow,

00:02:44.056 --> 00:02:46.546
I would like that as a son."

00:02:46.696 --> 00:02:49.986
&gt;&gt;Luis: My parents, they said the
only time they ever used technology

00:02:49.986 --> 00:02:50.976
was the ATM.

00:03:10.086 --> 00:03:11.626
&gt;&gt;Luis: And then after that,
them my mom asked me to put

00:03:11.626 --> 00:03:13.476
like the soap operas on, on YouTube.

00:03:13.926 --> 00:03:15.716
&gt;&gt;Mom: Oh, yes.

00:03:16.156 --> 00:03:18.836
&gt;&gt;Teacher: This is the
score that falls right

00:03:18.836 --> 00:03:21.786
in the middle of all of your scores.

00:03:22.116 --> 00:03:22.616
So if you have--

00:03:22.616 --> 00:03:25.246
&gt;&gt;Luis: On a Monday or on
a Thursday, I usually stay

00:03:25.246 --> 00:03:26.706
after school to do extra work.

00:03:27.276 --> 00:03:31.976
And on Wednesdays is when I
have the Tech Wizards program.

00:03:32.046 --> 00:03:33.046
&gt;&gt;Lisa: The Intel 4-H
Tech Wizards is an

00:03:33.196 --> 00:03:36.476
after school tiered mentoring
program that introduces

00:03:36.576 --> 00:03:41.566
under represented youth to education
pathways and careers, in science,

00:03:41.606 --> 00:03:43.856
technology, engineering and math.

00:03:44.116 --> 00:03:45.766
&gt;&gt;Cecilia: -- the interview,
it's right there.

00:03:45.766 --> 00:03:48.366
And then what kind of shots
you're gonna be doing,

00:03:48.366 --> 00:03:50.706
close up, medium, long shot.

00:03:50.876 --> 00:03:53.606
&gt;&gt;The majority of the students
know about technology nowadays.

00:03:53.606 --> 00:03:56.796
They use iPads, they use cell
phones, they use video cameras.

00:03:57.016 --> 00:03:58.616
They use their computers.

00:03:58.676 --> 00:04:05.066
So we use those tools kind of
like the hook for the program.

00:04:05.646 --> 00:04:07.186
&gt;&gt;Luis: Five, four...

00:04:08.196 --> 00:04:11.786
&gt;&gt;Luis: We divide into groups and
each group did their own project.

00:04:11.786 --> 00:04:14.956
And it could either be related to
something fun like a music video,

00:04:15.286 --> 00:04:18.036
or something more in depth,
like a community project,

00:04:18.116 --> 00:04:20.976
like filming the local flea
market, which is what we did.

00:04:24.916 --> 00:04:27.886
&gt;&gt;Lisa: In the beginning,
what we try to do is motivate.

00:04:27.886 --> 00:04:33.626
And then if all things come
together as they should, pretty soon,

00:04:33.626 --> 00:04:36.306
we're just trying to
get out of the way.

00:04:36.306 --> 00:04:37.386
&gt;&gt;Student on video:
[speaking Spanish].

00:04:37.386 --> 00:04:39.746
&gt;&gt;Lisa: Because you
have started something.

00:04:42.046 --> 00:04:43.826
&gt;&gt;Luis: The Tech Wizards,
they decided to do a project

00:04:43.826 --> 00:04:47.326
on the street trees, and we do it
with a partnership with the City

00:04:47.326 --> 00:04:50.646
of Hillsboro, that's called
Street Tree Inventory Project

00:04:51.256 --> 00:04:53.356
which is evaluating the
conditions of the trees

00:04:53.666 --> 00:04:57.466
and then reporting to the city.

00:04:57.536 --> 00:05:00.786
The information we collected
included the species of the tree.

00:05:01.276 --> 00:05:05.926
We collected its height, its width,
the canopy size, the conditions.

00:05:06.556 --> 00:05:10.646
&gt;&gt;Lisa: He was selected to go do
a presentation in Santiago, Chile.

00:05:11.896 --> 00:05:15.526
Where he's gonna be doing a world
class presentation, literally.

00:05:16.916 --> 00:05:20.226
I always ask the kids,
"What was the best part?"

00:05:20.226 --> 00:05:24.566
and I assume that they might say,
"Oh, travel," or something like that.

00:05:24.896 --> 00:05:28.396
No. The best part was doing
the presentation and realizing

00:05:28.396 --> 00:05:31.976
that he had the capability
now to do something like this.

00:05:35.046 --> 00:05:37.556
&gt;&gt;Luis: Okay, that
motor's right here.

00:05:37.556 --> 00:05:40.776
It controls the steering.

00:05:41.376 --> 00:05:44.356
&gt;&gt;Cecilia: Lego robotics is another
project where the students learn how

00:05:44.356 --> 00:05:47.426
to use math, science and engineering.

00:05:47.426 --> 00:05:48.266
&gt;&gt;Luis: What would you like for it?

00:05:48.266 --> 00:05:50.606
Like you want it to be the
fastest, the strongest?

00:05:50.606 --> 00:05:53.886
&gt;&gt;Cecilia: Each student works
with an elementary student,

00:05:53.886 --> 00:05:57.016
and they teach them how
to program their robots.

00:05:57.416 --> 00:05:59.386
&gt;&gt;Luis: And then let's see how
it looks, and then you can start

00:05:59.386 --> 00:06:00.766
like building the catapillar.

00:06:02.026 --> 00:06:05.396
&gt;&gt;They're not just learning about the
technology of how to build robots,

00:06:05.696 --> 00:06:08.046
but they're learning
about working together.

00:06:08.046 --> 00:06:09.506
I think that's the
most important part.

00:06:09.816 --> 00:06:10.966
And those are like skills

00:06:10.966 --> 00:06:13.026
that I believe should be
learned at an early age.

00:06:13.326 --> 00:06:15.716
&gt;&gt;It's like automatic everything.

00:06:15.716 --> 00:06:17.236
You have to program it.

00:06:17.236 --> 00:06:18.446
So that's like one of the key things.

00:06:18.446 --> 00:06:20.516
You just can like move it
with the remote control

00:06:20.516 --> 00:06:21.686
and make it go forward
and then go back.

00:06:21.686 --> 00:06:24.506
You have to like think
out in advance.

00:06:24.866 --> 00:06:29.936
&gt;&gt;We teach them how to build,
how to program and how to compete

00:06:29.936 --> 00:06:32.706
in a tournament that
takes place every year.

00:06:36.076 --> 00:06:37.286
&gt;&gt;My parents always ask me like,

00:06:37.286 --> 00:06:39.026
"Why are you staying all
the time after school?

00:06:39.026 --> 00:06:40.466
Like, why don't you ever come home?"

00:06:40.526 --> 00:06:41.916
I'm like, "I'm trying
to help other people,

00:06:41.916 --> 00:06:42.976
I'm trying to help the community."

00:06:45.046 --> 00:06:48.296
And once they actually came
and saw what I was doing,

00:06:48.296 --> 00:06:48.976
they said, "All right, yeah."

00:07:07.416 --> 00:07:10.696
&gt;&gt;Luis: Being the first person
in my family to go to college,

00:07:10.696 --> 00:07:14.446
or planning to go to college
definitely like excites me.

00:07:14.446 --> 00:07:17.926
&gt;&gt;All these opportunities I've
gotten, I realize that it's

00:07:18.086 --> 00:07:19.636
because of others that I have them.

00:07:19.786 --> 00:07:22.356
I just didn't stumble upon them.

00:07:22.426 --> 00:07:24.976
Others presented them to me,
and I took advantage of them.

00:07:31.066 --> 00:07:35.026
&gt;&gt;The first time I remember using
computers, maybe in kindergarten.

00:07:35.026 --> 00:07:37.316
After that, I went through a
lot of like older computers,

00:07:37.316 --> 00:07:41.346
I bought like at thrift stores and
garage sales, and I opened them up

00:07:41.526 --> 00:07:42.886
and see what were inside.

00:07:43.126 --> 00:07:46.236
But when I bought my own
computer, which was maybe

00:07:46.236 --> 00:07:48.266
about four years ago,
it took that long.

00:07:48.386 --> 00:07:51.686
I was like, I kept nagging my parents
for years to buy me a computer,

00:07:51.686 --> 00:07:54.796
but once they bought it, you know, I
started like trying to do everything.

00:08:01.056 --> 00:08:03.196
