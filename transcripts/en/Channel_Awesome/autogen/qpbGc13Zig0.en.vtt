Davy Crockett it's just totally

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120
Davy Crockett it's just totally
 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.390
Davy Crockett it's just totally
glorifying the myth and lore except this

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400
glorifying the myth and lore except this

00:03:48.439 --> 00:03:48.449
Davy Crockett story maybe without the
 

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:50.360
Davy Crockett story maybe without the
heavier moments I'd say this is a good

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370
heavier moments I'd say this is a good
 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:51.860

one to check out nothing spectacular

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:51.870

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.560
just the right amount of excitement and
