00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:01.023
- [Voiceover] Let's see if we can take

00:00:01.023 --> 00:00:06.023
the indefinite integral of
sine of x to the fourth dx.

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:11.000
And like always, pause the video

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.848
and see if you can work
through it on your own.

00:00:13.433 --> 00:00:17.033
So if we had an odd exponent up here,

00:00:17.033 --> 00:00:19.233
whether it was a sine or a cosine,

00:00:19.233 --> 00:00:20.833
then the technique I would use,

00:00:20.833 --> 00:00:24.233
so if this was sine to the third of x,

00:00:24.233 --> 00:00:26.400
I would separate one
of the sine of xs out,

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.966
so I would rewrite it as sine
squared x times sine of x,

00:00:30.966 --> 00:00:32.133
and then I would convert this

00:00:32.133 --> 00:00:34.300
using the Pythagorean Identity,

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:35.633
and then when I distribute the sine of x,

00:00:35.633 --> 00:00:37.966
I'd be able to use u-substitution.

00:00:37.966 --> 00:00:39.633
We've done that in
previous example videos.

00:00:39.633 --> 00:00:40.600
You could have done this if it was

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.127
cosine to the third of x
as well, or to the fifth,

00:00:44.127 --> 00:00:46.566
or to the seventh, if
you had an odd exponent.

00:00:46.566 --> 00:00:48.200
But here we have an even exponent.

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:49.586
So what do we do?

00:00:50.233 --> 00:00:51.533
So the technique we will use,

00:00:51.533 --> 00:00:53.433
and I guess you could call it a trick,

00:00:53.433 --> 00:00:54.994
the technique or trick to use

00:00:54.994 --> 00:00:58.133
is once again you want to
algebraically manipulate this

00:00:58.133 --> 00:01:00.000
so you can use integration techniques

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.261
that we are familiar with.

00:01:01.261 --> 00:01:02.700
And in this case we would want to use

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.166
the Double Angle Identity.

00:01:05.166 --> 00:01:09.935
The Double Angle Identity
tells us that sine squared of x

00:01:09.935 --> 00:01:14.935
is equal to 1/2 times one
minus cosine of two x.

00:01:19.101 --> 00:01:21.509
So how can I apply this over here?

00:01:22.002 --> 00:01:25.011
Our original integral is
just the same thing as,

00:01:25.011 --> 00:01:26.728
this is going to be the same thing as

00:01:26.728 --> 00:01:31.728
the integral of sine of x
squared, all of that squared, dx.

00:01:33.432 --> 00:01:36.009
Now I can make this substitution.

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:41.009
So this is the same thing as this,

00:01:41.246 --> 00:01:42.715
which is of course the same thing as this

00:01:42.715 --> 00:01:44.566
by the Double Angle Identity.

00:01:44.566 --> 00:01:49.566
So I could rewrite it
as the integral of 1/2

00:01:52.433 --> 00:01:55.633
times one minus cosine of two x,

00:01:55.633 --> 00:02:00.633
and then all of that squared dx.

00:02:01.346 --> 00:02:02.966
And what is that going to be equal to?

00:02:02.966 --> 00:02:04.700
That's going to be equal to, let's see.

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.396
1/2 squared is 1/4, so
I can take that out.

00:02:07.766 --> 00:02:12.766
So we get 1/4 times the integral of...

00:02:13.861 --> 00:02:16.089
I'm just going to square
all this business.

00:02:16.474 --> 00:02:21.474
One squared, which is one,
minus two cosine of two x

00:02:22.233 --> 00:02:27.233
plus cosine squared of two x dx.

00:02:30.283 --> 00:02:35.283
Fairly straightforward to
take the indefinite integral,

00:02:36.466 --> 00:02:38.066
or to take the antiderivative
of these two pieces.

00:02:38.066 --> 00:02:39.666
But what do I do here?

00:02:39.666 --> 00:02:42.566
Once again I've got an even exponent.

00:02:42.566 --> 00:02:45.655
Let's apply the Double
Angle Identity for cosine.

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:50.692
We know that cosine squared of two x

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.133
is going to be equal to 1/2 times one plus

00:02:55.133 --> 00:03:00.100
cosine of double this
angle, so cosine of four x.

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:02.667
Once again just make the substitution.

00:03:02.667 --> 00:03:06.751
This is going to be equal to...

00:03:06.751 --> 00:03:08.433
Actually let me just write it this way.

00:03:08.433 --> 00:03:12.200
1/4, and maybe I'll switch...

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:13.433
I'll just keep it in this color.

00:03:13.433 --> 00:03:18.433
1/4 times one minus two
cosine two x plus 1/2,

00:03:25.792 --> 00:03:26.967
I'll just distribute the 1/2.

00:03:26.967 --> 00:03:31.967
Plus 1/2 plus 1/2 cosine of four x dx.

00:03:37.119 --> 00:03:42.119
Let's see, I could take this
1/2 and add it to this one,

00:03:43.081 --> 00:03:45.566
and that's going to get me 3/2,

00:03:45.566 --> 00:03:48.733
so add those together,
I'm going to get 3/2.

00:03:48.733 --> 00:03:52.000
So let me rewrite this as, I'm
in the home stretch really,

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:57.000
this is going to be equal to
1/4 times the integral of 3/2

00:03:58.027 --> 00:04:01.500
minus two cosine of two x.

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:04.507
The derivative of four x is four,

00:04:04.507 --> 00:04:06.067
so it'd be great if I had a four out here.

00:04:06.067 --> 00:04:09.802
Let me rewrite 1/2 as four over eight.

00:04:09.802 --> 00:04:11.800
Really I'm just multiplying
and dividing by four.

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:12.866
That's one way to think about it.

00:04:12.866 --> 00:04:17.866
So I could say, plus 1/8
times four cosine of four x.

00:04:22.766 --> 00:04:24.712
I'm just doing this so that it's...

00:04:24.712 --> 00:04:26.066
In theory you could do u-substitution,

00:04:26.066 --> 00:04:27.742
but we've have a lot
of practice with this.

00:04:27.742 --> 00:04:29.619
I have a function, I have its derivative,

00:04:29.619 --> 00:04:30.833
I could just integrate with respect

00:04:30.833 --> 00:04:33.366
to the four x right over there.

00:04:33.366 --> 00:04:34.833
I guess you could say it's
the reverse chain rule,

00:04:34.833 --> 00:04:37.766
which is really what
u-substitution is all about.

00:04:37.766 --> 00:04:40.066
Now I'm ready to integrate.

00:04:40.066 --> 00:04:41.466
So this is going to be equal to,

00:04:41.466 --> 00:04:43.166
I think we deserve a
little bit of a drumroll,

00:04:43.166 --> 00:04:48.166
1/4 times 3/2 x,

00:04:48.966 --> 00:04:51.233
c-derivative of two x is
sitting right over here too,

00:04:51.233 --> 00:04:54.733
so this is going to be
minus sine of two x.

00:04:54.733 --> 00:04:56.766
We can verify that this
is a c-derivative of this.

00:04:56.766 --> 00:04:59.215
It's going to be two cosine of two x,

00:04:59.215 --> 00:05:00.716
we have it right over there,

00:05:01.209 --> 00:05:06.209
plus 1/8 times sine of four x.

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:09.700
Derivative of sine of four x

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:12.500
is going to be four cosine of four x,

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:15.100
which is exactly what we have there.

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:17.863
And then home stretch, we just write

00:05:17.863 --> 00:05:19.866
the plus C, plus sub constant.

00:05:19.866 --> 00:05:21.500
This is an indefinite integral.

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:23.567
And we're all done.

00:05:23.567 --> 00:05:25.630
This wasn't the simplest of problems,

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:27.496
but it also wasn't too bad.

00:05:27.496 --> 00:05:30.333
And it's strangely
satisfying to get it done.
