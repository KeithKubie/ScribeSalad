00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:08.109
Thanks so much for joining.

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:10.120

neighborhood, that takes place

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:19.586
right here in Chicago.

00:00:19.586 --> 00:00:21.460

from many TV shows and movies.

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:26.800
They're also a very talented
group of stand-up comedians,

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.290
and are in the middle of a
coast-to-coast stand-up comedy

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:29.800
tour.

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.170
They're going to be
performing at Zanies tonight.

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:34.150
And tonight also marks

00:00:45.038 --> 00:00:47.022
[AUDIENCE APPLAUSE]

00:00:47.022 --> 00:00:50.990
JERMAINE FOWLER: That's
right, mother fuckers.

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:52.190
MAZ JOBRANI: Hello.

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:53.630
DAVID KOECHNER: Good afternoon.

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:55.570
JERMAINE FOWLER: Great
crowd, thanks for coming out.

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:56.350
RELL BATTLE: Really
packed it out.

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:56.810
Thank y'all so much.

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:59.101
JERMAINE FOWLER: Really packed
it out, too many people.

00:00:59.101 --> 00:01:00.714
I'm a little nervous now.

00:01:00.714 --> 00:01:02.880
Welcome to all you guys for
coming out this evening,

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:04.130
appreciate you for being here.

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:05.519
MAZ JOBRANI: Skipping work.

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:06.643
SPEAKER 2: This is awesome.

00:01:06.643 --> 00:01:09.070
DAVID KOECHNER: They need
a reason to skip work.

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:12.620
RELL BATTLE: The drugs
are kicking in, excuse us.

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:15.410
SPEAKER 2: So, I think we should
start every Google meeting just

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:16.220
like that.

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:18.090
That would be freaking awesome.

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.850
So thank you guys
for being here.

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.390
We are excited to
be able to have

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:26.150
the cast of a show
that's being shot--

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:28.610
that's based on uptown Chicago.

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:32.050
And having you guys here,
a handful of questions

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:34.610
that any of you can answer.

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:36.611
I am excited because
I actually used

00:01:36.611 --> 00:01:38.402
to live in uptown,
which if any of you guys

00:01:38.402 --> 00:01:40.860
have lived in uptown, you know
how challenging that can be,

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.090
still to this day.

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:47.480
And uptown has-- you've got
your somewhat disenfranchised.

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:50.707
You've got lots of different
kinds of people living there.

00:01:50.707 --> 00:01:53.165
You've got lots of different
opportunities for improvement.

00:01:53.165 --> 00:01:54.800
RELL BATTLE: Just
say minorities.

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:56.571
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:56.571 --> 00:01:57.070
I'm playing.

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:58.444
SPEAKER 2: You've
got minorities,

00:01:58.444 --> 00:01:59.590
you've got everything.

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:02.240
So, what do you want
the folks in uptown--

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.160
like, how are they
served by your show?

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:07.670
And what things would you say
to them if they were here?

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.009
Just curious.

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:14.010
RELL BATTLE: I think
our cast is very mixed.

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.430
So we're pretty much-- that's
what uptown looks like.

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:18.590
Every type of
person represented.

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:20.210
African-Americans, white.

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:21.200
He's Middle Eastern.

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:22.610
JERMAINE FOWLER: I am, yeah.

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:23.250
RELL BATTLE: The other guy.

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:24.541
JERMAINE FOWLER: Oh, Maz, yeah.

00:02:24.541 --> 00:02:27.590
RELL BATTLE: Diane
Guerrero, she's Colombian.

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:30.950
Judd's character is Jewish.

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:32.365
We cover every
base, pretty much.

00:02:32.365 --> 00:02:33.240
We're a diverse show.

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.215
So it represents the
real uptown of Chicago.

00:02:35.215 --> 00:02:36.090
SPEAKER 2: Very nice.

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.750
So we always talk about, here
at Google, unconscious bias,

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:39.250
right?

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:42.800
And it's something that
we all obviously have,

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.380
whether we're aware of
it or not, funny enough.

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:47.396
So can you kind
of share with us--

00:02:47.396 --> 00:02:50.985
as you guys approach some of the
shows, how they're structured,

00:02:50.985 --> 00:02:51.860
how they're written--

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:53.810
how you're kind
of tackling that?

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:55.250
DAVID KOECHNER: We did a
whole show on that, didn't we?

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:56.875
JERMAINE FOWLER:
Yeah, we actually did.

00:02:56.875 --> 00:02:58.560
Unconscious bias.

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:59.640
DAVID KOECHNER: Was that last
year or was that this year?

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:00.290
JERMAINE FOWLER: Last season.

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:00.650
DAVID KOECHNER: Right.

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:01.880
JERMAINE FOWLER: This
season was micro-aggression.

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:02.580
DAVID KOECHNER: Right.

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:03.621
JERMAINE FOWLER: Sort of.

00:03:03.621 --> 00:03:06.320
MAZ JOBRANI: Wait, which one
was the unconscious bias one?

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:07.400
RELL BATTLE: We don't
watch our show often.

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.608
SPEAKER 2: Was it the one
where you had the hoodie on

00:03:09.608 --> 00:03:12.150
and you said, I am just a
black man with a hoodie.

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:12.980
JERMAINE FOWLER:
Baseball episode.

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:14.480
RELL BATTLE: Yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:18.680
JERMAINE FOWLER: We did that
last episode where people don't

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:23.519
really know they might be doing
something racist or prejudice,

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:26.060
but it's just instilled in them
that they've been conditioned

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:26.960
to think that way.

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:28.730
And that was the episode
we did last year.

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:31.210
This season, we touched
on micro-aggression.

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:35.432
And I'm pretty sure some people
might have experienced that,

00:03:35.432 --> 00:03:36.140
whether that be--

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:41.530
I don't know if
Google does that.

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:43.556
It makes me laugh.

00:03:43.556 --> 00:03:45.430
It just makes me laugh,
Google might do that.

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:49.700
But I worked at certain jobs and
I've been asked certain things.

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:51.440
Like, in this
particular episode,

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:55.010
Franco gets asked, hey, man,
you watch the basketball game

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:56.786
last night?

00:03:56.786 --> 00:03:58.160
Jimmy Butler had
a terrible game.

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:59.230
Might need you to suit up.

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:00.590
You know, that was one
line the guy said to me.

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:02.830
I'm like, hey, look, I don't
really watch basketball.

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:05.580
And the guy's like, really?

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:08.390
And I'm like, man,
fuck you, man.

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:09.740
I used to get that a lot.

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:11.840
I kind of still
get that shit, man.

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:13.286
It annoys me the most.

00:04:13.286 --> 00:04:15.410
DAVID KOECHNER: Basketball
or boxing, I'm assuming.

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:16.160
JERMAINE FOWLER: I like boxing.

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:16.769
DAVID KOECHNER: You
follow boxing, yeah?

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:17.630
JERMAINE FOWLER: Boxing's cool.

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:18.370
MAZ JOBRANI: Do you
watch basketball?

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:19.450
RELL BATTLE: I
actually follow both.

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:20.060
JERMAINE FOWLER:
No, I like skate--

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:21.600
I actually like X Games, man.

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:22.350
MAZ JOBRANI: You
watch the X Games?

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:23.300
JERMAINE FOWLER: I
like the X Games a lot.

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.540
RELL BATTLE: Really?

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:25.165
MAZ JOBRANI: How
often do they do that?

00:04:25.165 --> 00:04:26.456
JERMAINE FOWLER: He's doing it.

00:04:26.456 --> 00:04:27.250
You all see what--

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:29.375
MAZ JOBRANI: How often--
is that a four year thing,

00:04:29.375 --> 00:04:30.500
or is that every year?

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:31.410
JERMAINE FOWLER: X
Games are every year.

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:31.550
MAZ JOBRANI: OK.

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:32.830
JERMAINE FOWLER: Not like
the Olympics or anything.

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:34.370
MAZ JOBRANI: Well, they call
it the games, I thought maybe--

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:35.245
JERMAINE FOWLER: Nah.

00:04:35.245 --> 00:04:36.946
It's just, you know--

00:04:36.946 --> 00:04:38.485
RELL BATTLE: What
was the question?

00:04:38.485 --> 00:04:40.610
MAZ JOBRANI: I'm Middle
Eastern and I watch soccer.

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:42.318
SPEAKER 2: It was
about unconscious bias.

00:04:42.318 --> 00:04:43.910
MAZ JOBRANI: So I fit the--

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:46.100
Middle Eastern
people like soccer.

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:47.850
DAVID KOECHNER: I'm
white and I love guns.

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:49.886
MAZ JOBRANI: There you go.

00:04:49.886 --> 00:04:51.260
DAVID KOECHNER:
Guns and limiting

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:52.720
other people's liberty.

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:54.720
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:57.290
JERMAINE FOWLER: He couldn't
even pronounce liberty.

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:59.460
That's how white he is.

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:00.960
DAVID KOECHNER:
Limiting liberty.

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:03.460
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:05.414 --> 00:05:07.580
MAZ JOBRANI: And he's being
served by Mueller today,

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:08.510
later, yeah?

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:10.760
JERMAINE FOWLER: Yeah, they
have an indictment on him.

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:12.260
SPEAKER 2: That's awesome.

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:15.020
So, it's interesting that
you talk about stereotypes

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:19.220
because oftentimes,
African-Americans are always

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:21.819
seen as, back in the
day, you used to say,

00:05:21.819 --> 00:05:23.110
well, you can tap dance, right?

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:23.880
You can dance.

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:24.680
You can play ball.

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:25.347
You can do this.

00:05:25.347 --> 00:05:26.721
And you guys are
comedians, which

00:05:26.721 --> 00:05:29.180
is also an area where there's
lots of African-Americans.

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:32.990
So, how do you toe
the line between being

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:34.640
able to share your
message and not

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:36.035
being stereotyped yourselves?

00:05:36.035 --> 00:05:38.410
JERMAINE FOWLER: You got to
be honest with yourself, man.

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:41.479
If you like things, you
like certain things,

00:05:41.479 --> 00:05:42.520
like the things you like.

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:47.270
It's funny, I grew up in
DC, all black neighborhood,

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:48.150
some Hispanic.

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:50.375
And I remember--

00:05:50.375 --> 00:05:52.000
I guess I was
skateboarding around town

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.880
and I was really
into like filmmaking,

00:05:53.880 --> 00:06:00.590
and shit that wasn't relative
to my family growing up.

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:04.720
My family loved boxing and
basketball and all that stuff.

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:06.240
So I got called a
white boy a lot.

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:06.800
DAVID KOECHNER: Did you really?

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:07.220
JERMAINE FOWLER: I did.

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:08.770
SPEAKER 2: So
would you say Oreo?

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:09.686
JERMAINE FOWLER: Oreo.

00:06:09.686 --> 00:06:11.730
I got Oreo sometimes.

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:14.980
And I hated that
because you can--

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:16.810
it's so weird because
I feel like the more

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:18.985
you're trying to be--

00:06:18.985 --> 00:06:21.230
the more you try to
cater to other people,

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:25.272
the more you lose less of who
you want to be and who you are.

00:06:25.272 --> 00:06:27.730
So I never really cared about
what people thought about me.

00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:30.400
Because the more you think
about you becoming a stereotype

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:31.816
or are you not
being a stereotype,

00:06:31.816 --> 00:06:34.910
it's just going to eat you
up and really make you--

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:36.280
it'll just ruin your day.

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:37.170
It's just exhausting.

00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:38.586
MAZ JOBRANI: I
think the show also

00:06:38.586 --> 00:06:45.370
has a good representation
from liberal to conservative

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:48.250
and different colors
in the show actually.

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:50.280
So I play an
Arab-American in there.

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:53.200
I play an Iraqi-American
who is conservative

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:54.670
and a Trump supporter.

00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:56.410
So you have that,
and then you've

00:06:56.410 --> 00:07:00.640
got the young African-American
guy who's very liberal.

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:02.015
And then you got--

00:07:02.015 --> 00:07:04.360
DAVID KOECHNER: Disenfranchised,
blue collar, white guy.

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:05.110
MAZ JOBRANI: Yeah.

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:06.450
And then you got the
older Jewish guy.

00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:07.320
So you got every person.

00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:08.486
And then you got the female.

00:07:08.486 --> 00:07:10.570
You got, now, the
young Latina female.

00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:13.150
And then you've got
the older female who's

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:15.970
been in the neighborhood
and she's tough,

00:07:15.970 --> 00:07:17.980
and she comes from
an Italian family.

00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:20.610
So everybody's covered.

00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:22.797
So we get to bring out
a subject, any subject,

00:07:22.797 --> 00:07:24.880
and give all these different
points of view on it.

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:27.130
SPEAKER 2: Which is awesome,
because you're not even Iraqi,

00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:27.550
are you?

00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:28.480
MAZ JOBRANI: I'm Iranian.

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:29.190
SPEAKER 2: Iranian, right?

00:07:29.190 --> 00:07:29.550
MAZ JOBRANI: Yeah.

00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:31.610
I wanted them to do
an Iranian character,

00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:34.340
but they wanted someone
from a war-torn country.

00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:37.174
And I said, well, Iran
was in a war with Iraq.

00:07:37.174 --> 00:07:39.340
But then they said, we think
that the general public

00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:40.655
might not remember that war.

00:07:40.655 --> 00:07:41.760
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:42.880
At least in America.

00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:43.980
And I said, all right.

00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:44.772
I said, OK, touche.

00:07:44.772 --> 00:07:46.688
DAVID KOECHNER: It wasn't
covered intensively.

00:07:46.688 --> 00:07:48.040
MAZ JOBRANI: It's a shame.

00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:50.800
It's a shame, but you know
how they say Americans,

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:53.700
we don't really pay attention to
the rest of the world, really.

00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:56.484
DAVID KOECHNER: We didn't
cover the 1953 CIA coup.

00:07:56.484 --> 00:07:58.150
MAZ JOBRANI: We did
not cover that coup.

00:07:58.150 --> 00:08:01.224
And also, by the way, we
weren't at war with Iran.

00:08:01.224 --> 00:08:03.640
If we'd been in war with Iran,
maybe the Iranian character

00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:04.556
would have worked out.

00:08:04.556 --> 00:08:06.629
But then again, we may be
going to war with Iran.

00:08:06.629 --> 00:08:08.170
So, maybe the guy
will become Iranian

00:08:08.170 --> 00:08:10.630
in the next couple
of seasons if Trump

00:08:10.630 --> 00:08:11.020
keeps going the way he's going.

00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:12.490
DAVID KOECHNER: We'll
find an Iraqi to play him.

00:08:12.490 --> 00:08:13.780
MAZ JOBRANI: We'll get
an Iraqi to play him.

00:08:13.780 --> 00:08:14.280
That's how it goes.

00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:16.090
JERMAINE FOWLER: That's
the balance right there.

00:08:16.090 --> 00:08:17.170
SPEAKER 2: So how
would you respond

00:08:17.170 --> 00:08:19.200
to some of the pushback
on how realistic

00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:20.555
you think the show is?

00:08:20.555 --> 00:08:22.513
DAVID KOECHNER: Wait,
first, is there pushback?

00:08:22.513 --> 00:08:23.260
JERMAINE FOWLER:
Is there pushback?

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:25.070
MAZ JOBRANI: And is it
supposed to be realistic?

00:08:25.070 --> 00:08:26.320
I mean it's not a documentary.

00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:27.475
It's a sitcom.

00:08:27.475 --> 00:08:29.141
JERMAINE FOWLER: Yeah,
we're having fun.

00:08:29.141 --> 00:08:29.325
SPEAKER 2: True enough.

00:08:29.325 --> 00:08:31.158
MAZ JOBRANI: I mean,
was Cheers really a bar

00:08:31.158 --> 00:08:34.299
owned by a baseball
player that--

00:08:34.299 --> 00:08:36.370
RELL BATTLE: They shot
"Cheers" on a lot in LA.

00:08:36.370 --> 00:08:37.623
That's as real as it can get.

00:08:37.623 --> 00:08:39.039
JERMAINE FOWLER:
It wasn't Boston?

00:08:39.039 --> 00:08:39.880
SPEAKER 2: All right,
well that's perfect.

00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:42.760
Because a lot of times people
say that, in Chicago, it's

00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:44.080
very, very segregated.

00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:46.060
So the chances of
actually having

00:08:46.060 --> 00:08:49.680
all of those different groups
represented, consistently

00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:51.700
anywhere is very, very slim.

00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:54.132
So, it's interesting that you
have a platform for showing

00:08:54.132 --> 00:08:55.340
how that could come together.

00:08:55.340 --> 00:08:57.260
But I just wonder
what commentary--

00:08:57.260 --> 00:09:00.474
MAZ JOBRANI: That's like the
reverse criticism of "Friends,"

00:09:00.474 --> 00:09:01.390
which was in New York.

00:09:01.390 --> 00:09:03.070
And everyone was like,
they're all white.

00:09:03.070 --> 00:09:04.370
And now we got a mixed
group, and they're like,

00:09:04.370 --> 00:09:05.343
they're too mixed.

00:09:05.343 --> 00:09:06.676
JERMAINE FOWLER: It's too mixed.

00:09:06.676 --> 00:09:07.996
Hey, tone that shit down, man.

00:09:07.996 --> 00:09:09.620
RELL BATTLE: Mexicans
don't eat donuts.

00:09:09.620 --> 00:09:10.795
Get out of here.

00:09:10.795 --> 00:09:11.725
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:11.725 --> 00:09:13.590
What?

00:09:13.590 --> 00:09:15.790
MAZ JOBRANI: This is
a shop in an area that

00:09:15.790 --> 00:09:18.580
is being gentrified
that still has people

00:09:18.580 --> 00:09:21.400
from the old
neighborhood still there.

00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:22.799
So it's kind of a crossroads.

00:09:22.799 --> 00:09:24.340
JERMAINE FOWLER:
Yeah, gentrification

00:09:24.340 --> 00:09:25.990
plays a huge part in the show.

00:09:25.990 --> 00:09:26.560
We always talk about it.

00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:27.730
That's one thing we
can all agree on,

00:09:27.730 --> 00:09:28.980
this neighborhood is changing.

00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:33.040
And it's funny, because I've
done Zanies Comedy Club down

00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:34.800
at old town a bunch of times.

00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:36.790
And I just realized
driving down here,

00:09:36.790 --> 00:09:39.130
Dave told us that
Caprini-Green--

00:09:39.130 --> 00:09:40.210
SPEAKER 2: Cabrini-Green?

00:09:40.210 --> 00:09:41.870
JERMAINE FOWLER:
Cabrini-Green was a project--

00:09:41.870 --> 00:09:42.560
DAVID KOECHNER: It's
a mile from there.

00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:43.600
SPEAKER 2: It was
It's now a Target.

00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:44.870
JERMAINE FOWLER: It used
to be this building, right?

00:09:44.870 --> 00:09:45.599
I'm just playing.

00:09:45.599 --> 00:09:46.640
It wasn't Google, was it?

00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:46.920
SPEAKER 2: No.

00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:47.560
JERMAINE FOWLER:
But it was funny--

00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:48.520
SPEAKER 2: It's a Target now.

00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:49.550
JERMAINE FOWLER:
It's a Target now?

00:09:49.550 --> 00:09:50.590
SPEAKER 2: Yep,
Target's everywhere.

00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:52.006
JERMAINE FOWLER:
That's hilarious.

00:09:52.006 --> 00:09:53.900
MAZ JOBRANI: And Google isn't?

00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:56.500
You talked about
Target like, Target's

00:09:56.500 --> 00:09:58.618
taking over everything.

00:09:58.618 --> 00:10:00.046
Oh, wait a minute.

00:10:00.046 --> 00:10:02.317
To find a Target,
you've got to use

00:10:02.317 --> 00:10:05.230
Google to find where they are.

00:10:05.230 --> 00:10:06.490
They're all offended.

00:10:06.490 --> 00:10:07.120
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:08.828
JERMAINE FOWLER: We're
just playing, man.

00:10:08.828 --> 00:10:11.252
MAZ JOBRANI: That's not funny.

00:10:11.252 --> 00:10:14.150
Target's the enemy, not Google.

00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:15.900
We love you guys, give
us thought, please.

00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:16.260
JERMAINE FOWLER: We
were just playing.

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:17.555
These guys are great.

00:10:17.555 --> 00:10:19.684
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:19.684 --> 00:10:21.975
They're going to change the
algorithm of our names now.

00:10:21.975 --> 00:10:23.654
Be all negative.

00:10:23.654 --> 00:10:26.320
SPEAKER 2: So David, you spent a
lot of time on the comedy scene

00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:27.832
here in Chicago.

00:10:27.832 --> 00:10:30.040
Did that have anything to
do with you taking the role

00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:32.290
or not taking the role, or
being more excited about it

00:10:32.290 --> 00:10:33.370
because you could
identify with it?

00:10:33.370 --> 00:10:34.090
DAVID KOECHNER:
Probably a little bit

00:10:34.090 --> 00:10:35.020
more excited about it.

00:10:35.020 --> 00:10:36.811
In fact, I told
this story before.

00:10:36.811 --> 00:10:38.435
When I saw it was
announced-- because I

00:10:38.435 --> 00:10:41.496
don't know if you guys know
this, but it's based on a play.

00:10:41.496 --> 00:10:44.269
"Superior Donuts" was a
play set here in Chicago,

00:10:44.269 --> 00:10:46.060
and workshopped at the
Mary-Arrchie Theatre

00:10:46.060 --> 00:10:48.070
Company, and then
Steppenwolf Theater,

00:10:48.070 --> 00:10:49.955
and then went to Broadway.

00:10:49.955 --> 00:10:52.330
And I saw it announced in the
trades and for some reason,

00:10:52.330 --> 00:10:55.360
I said to myself, I'm
going to be in that.

00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:59.270
Just because I figured, I
don't know, it's my turn.

00:10:59.270 --> 00:11:01.480
But I just had a feeling,
and sometimes you do.

00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:04.240
And then lo and
behold, there it was.

00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:05.451
But yeah, I'm very happy.

00:11:05.451 --> 00:11:07.450
Now, a lot of my friends
auditioned for the part

00:11:07.450 --> 00:11:09.710
and didn't get it, so
they're not very happy.

00:11:09.710 --> 00:11:15.346
The real authentic Chicagoans
didn't actually get it.

00:11:15.346 --> 00:11:17.140
So yeah, that's a lot of fun.

00:11:17.140 --> 00:11:18.530
SPEAKER 2: That's cool.

00:11:18.530 --> 00:11:21.220
So you've got family,
you're out in California,

00:11:21.220 --> 00:11:24.220
and I heard you guys
have a grueling schedule.

00:11:24.220 --> 00:11:26.350
How do you balance all of that?

00:11:26.350 --> 00:11:27.254
That's a lot.

00:11:27.254 --> 00:11:28.545
DAVID KOECHNER: With intention.

00:11:28.545 --> 00:11:30.950
JERMAINE FOWLER: With Shauna.

00:11:30.950 --> 00:11:32.700
Shauna's our publicist,
she's right there.

00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:33.700
DAVID KOECHNER: But you're
talking about work--

00:11:33.700 --> 00:11:34.640
SPEAKER 2: In general, right?

00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:35.980
That's something
that a lot of times--

00:11:35.980 --> 00:11:37.313
I'm asking it very deliberately.

00:11:37.313 --> 00:11:39.370
A lot of times--

00:11:39.370 --> 00:11:40.720
this is unplugged a little bit--

00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:41.980
women always get
asked that, right?

00:11:41.980 --> 00:11:43.660
We always say, oh, you
got kids, you got this,

00:11:43.660 --> 00:11:44.460
how are you balancing it all?

00:11:44.460 --> 00:11:45.680
But I think that, a
lot of times, people

00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:47.750
don't realize that men
have to balance that, too.

00:11:47.750 --> 00:11:50.620
So I just wanted to know
how you do all of that.

00:11:50.620 --> 00:11:53.460
DAVID KOECHNER: The good news is
that our schedule is actually--

00:11:53.460 --> 00:11:56.800
to work in a multi-cam,
you're actually

00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:58.337
working less than
30 hours a week.

00:11:58.337 --> 00:11:59.920
MAZ JOBRANI: Oh, no,
it's close to 40.

00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:01.210
It is, I did the math.

00:12:01.210 --> 00:12:02.010
DAVID KOECHNER: OK.

00:12:02.010 --> 00:12:03.760
MAZ JOBRANI: I thought
it was less than 30

00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:05.880
until I stopped seeing my
kids on Monday and Tuesday.

00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:08.255
And I was like, oh that's
because we're shooting all day.

00:12:08.255 --> 00:12:10.160
DAVID KOECHNER: But
for instance, Wednesday

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:12.201
is when our work week
starts with our table read.

00:12:12.201 --> 00:12:14.620
We get there at 10:00
and we're out at 2:00.

00:12:14.620 --> 00:12:15.952
That's a pretty good day.

00:12:15.952 --> 00:12:17.660
And that goes on for
three days in a row.

00:12:17.660 --> 00:12:19.201
MAZ JOBRANI: You're
absolutely right.

00:12:19.201 --> 00:12:22.130
DAVID KOECHNER: And then,
sometimes Mondays are 10 hours.

00:12:22.130 --> 00:12:24.479
And sometimes,
Tuesdays are 10 hours.

00:12:24.479 --> 00:12:26.270
MAZ JOBRANI: 10 to 12,
both of those, yeah.

00:12:26.270 --> 00:12:27.260
JERMAINE FOWLER: Multi-cam
hours are a little easier.

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:28.635
MAZ JOBRANI: I'm
not complaining.

00:12:28.635 --> 00:12:31.690
I'm just saying, yeah,
I agree with you.

00:12:31.690 --> 00:12:34.210
DAVID KOECHNER: Every day, I
can take my kids to school.

00:12:34.210 --> 00:12:36.030
That's huge.

00:12:36.030 --> 00:12:39.610
And the show happens to shoot
10 minutes from my house,

00:12:39.610 --> 00:12:41.150
so it's perfect for me.

00:12:41.150 --> 00:12:41.817
SPEAKER 2: OK.

00:12:41.817 --> 00:12:43.400
So it's easy to put
all that together.

00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:44.941
DAVID KOECHNER:
Yeah, but in general,

00:12:44.941 --> 00:12:46.960
I think you have to have
the intention that I'm

00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:50.290
going to be there for my
kids as much as I can be.

00:12:50.290 --> 00:12:51.980
Or be available.

00:12:51.980 --> 00:12:53.080
SPEAKER 2: Very nice.

00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:54.580
I can appreciate that.

00:12:54.580 --> 00:12:57.727
So you guys have a show
premiering tonight.

00:12:57.727 --> 00:12:58.393
It's coming out.

00:12:58.393 --> 00:13:00.392
It's going to be on tonight
at 8 o'clock Central

00:13:00.392 --> 00:13:02.950
Standard time, 9
o'clock Eastern time.

00:13:02.950 --> 00:13:04.660
What do you want us
to know about that?

00:13:04.660 --> 00:13:06.576
What do you want us to
know about this season?

00:13:06.576 --> 00:13:07.719
How is it different?

00:13:07.719 --> 00:13:09.760
JERMAINE FOWLER: Well,
the first season is always

00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:11.700
just an introductory season.

00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:15.201
You're just trying to relay
information for the new viewers

00:13:15.201 --> 00:13:16.700
and the viewers in
the first season.

00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:17.920
It's a lot of regurgitation.

00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:22.099
It just kind of gets
a little repetitious.

00:13:22.099 --> 00:13:24.640
DAVID KOECHNER: You're really
establishing, for the audience,

00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:28.920
the primary relationship of
the show that people buy into.

00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:31.660
And the peripheral characters,
you're exploring less so.

00:13:31.660 --> 00:13:33.430
Because week to
week, like, no, no,

00:13:33.430 --> 00:13:36.154
this is the primary
relationship, focus on this.

00:13:36.154 --> 00:13:38.570
And I know you guys did have
a lot of that same like, hey,

00:13:38.570 --> 00:13:40.630
wait a minute,
hey wait a minute.

00:13:40.630 --> 00:13:41.520
JERMAINE FOWLER: In
the second season,

00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:43.660
we're really just kind of
letting everything breathe.

00:13:43.660 --> 00:13:45.951
And we get to open all the
characters up a little more.

00:13:45.951 --> 00:13:49.470
We get to explain why Maz
thinks the way he does

00:13:49.470 --> 00:13:50.877
or where Dave is coming from.

00:13:50.877 --> 00:13:52.710
DAVID KOECHNER: Introducing
a new character.

00:13:52.710 --> 00:13:53.560
JERMAINE FOWLER:
Yeah, Diane Guerrero.

00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:56.020
SPEAKER 2: Tell us about
that, and her organic truck.

00:13:56.020 --> 00:13:56.590
DAVID KOECHNER: Food truck.

00:13:56.590 --> 00:13:57.190
JERMAINE FOWLER: Oh, yeah.

00:13:57.190 --> 00:13:59.770
So Diane Guerrero, she was
in "Orange is the New Black."

00:13:59.770 --> 00:14:04.660
She plays Sophia and she
owns this organic food truck.

00:14:04.660 --> 00:14:09.050
And it's sort of a threat
to Arthur's business.

00:14:09.050 --> 00:14:10.140
And so they get into it.

00:14:10.140 --> 00:14:11.889
But deep down, Arthur
sort of respects her

00:14:11.889 --> 00:14:15.137
because she has this work
ethic that he can get behind.

00:14:15.137 --> 00:14:16.220
SPEAKER 2: That's awesome.

00:14:16.220 --> 00:14:18.470
Can't wait to see that.

00:14:18.470 --> 00:14:21.320
We're all huge fans of donuts
and of all things organic.

00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:24.080
So, I think it hits two
really great areas for us.

00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:26.720
JERMAINE FOWLER: What's
your favorite donut though?

00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:28.090
SPEAKER 2: My favorite donut?

00:14:28.090 --> 00:14:29.756
Hey, didn't everybody
ask you guys that?

00:14:29.756 --> 00:14:30.860
So, I like glazed.

00:14:30.860 --> 00:14:32.010
I'm old fashioned.

00:14:32.010 --> 00:14:34.190
I like the old fashioned glazed.

00:14:34.190 --> 00:14:36.140
Just give it to me
straight and easy.

00:14:36.140 --> 00:14:37.070
JERMAINE FOWLER:
I'm the same way.

00:14:37.070 --> 00:14:38.278
SPEAKER 2: Real simple stuff.

00:14:41.434 --> 00:14:43.850
"Superior Donuts"-- and I know,
as the executive producer,

00:14:43.850 --> 00:14:45.641
you're the actor, and
so you also have some

00:14:45.641 --> 00:14:50.060
say in what happens,
or I assume so.

00:14:50.060 --> 00:14:52.250
So clearly, it's a
platform for dealing

00:14:52.250 --> 00:14:53.566
with lots of social issues.

00:14:53.566 --> 00:14:55.190
I know that you
mentioned the one where

00:14:55.190 --> 00:14:57.084
you were talking
about the hoodie,

00:14:57.084 --> 00:14:59.000
and you're with all cops,
and you weren't sure

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.100
if that was the right time
to be talking about that.

00:15:02.100 --> 00:15:04.730
In a couple of
different episodes,

00:15:04.730 --> 00:15:07.794
there was one where they
thought that perhaps you

00:15:07.794 --> 00:15:10.460
took one of the pieces of art or
something that was on the wall,

00:15:10.460 --> 00:15:12.546
or some kind of
sports memorabilia

00:15:12.546 --> 00:15:13.420
that was on the wall.

00:15:13.420 --> 00:15:13.970
JERMAINE FOWLER:
Same episode, right.

00:15:13.970 --> 00:15:15.428
DAVID KOECHNER:
The baseball, yeah.

00:15:15.428 --> 00:15:18.580
JERMAINE FOWLER: Yeah, Arthur's
home run baseball that he got.

00:15:18.580 --> 00:15:22.010
SPEAKER 2: So comedy
and sitcoms have often

00:15:22.010 --> 00:15:25.310
been used as a platform for
addressing social issues.

00:15:25.310 --> 00:15:27.860
How is "Superior
Donuts" any different?

00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:29.610
JERMAINE FOWLER: Well,
I'll tell you this.

00:15:29.610 --> 00:15:31.050
I've done stand-up
about 10 years.

00:15:31.050 --> 00:15:35.240
And you know, I'm used to taking
things from news headlines,

00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:37.310
and going on stage
and yapping about it.

00:15:37.310 --> 00:15:39.860
So it was pretty
easy to go from that

00:15:39.860 --> 00:15:41.990
to doing "Superior Donuts"
because that's exactly

00:15:41.990 --> 00:15:43.580
what we're basically doing.

00:15:46.730 --> 00:15:49.700
In the writers room, we
bring up these issues

00:15:49.700 --> 00:15:53.240
as potential topics to
talk about in episodes.

00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:56.590
And all I have to do
in there is give them

00:15:56.590 --> 00:16:00.290
my experiences dealing with
these particular issues.

00:16:00.290 --> 00:16:04.790
Say we're talking about
the unconscious bias

00:16:04.790 --> 00:16:06.980
episode, where the cop
was following me around.

00:16:06.980 --> 00:16:09.440
And I'm like, hey, you know,
one time that happened to me.

00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:10.190
A friend of mine--

00:16:10.190 --> 00:16:12.356
I watched a friend of mine
get his ass beat by a cop

00:16:12.356 --> 00:16:15.600
back in Maryland and it was the
first time I ever seen that.

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:18.470
It really changed the way I
looked at police officers.

00:16:18.470 --> 00:16:19.820
So I tell them these stories.

00:16:19.820 --> 00:16:22.180
And what happens is they
sort of include them

00:16:22.180 --> 00:16:23.930
in certain parts and scenes.

00:16:23.930 --> 00:16:27.320
And as an actor, it motivates
me to get certain areas

00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:28.640
to get emotional.

00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:30.015
Because I really
do get emotional

00:16:30.015 --> 00:16:31.806
when I do these scenes,
especially when I'm

00:16:31.806 --> 00:16:34.820
doing it with Judd, because
Judd is masterful, you know?

00:16:34.820 --> 00:16:39.465
But those topics
are just something

00:16:39.465 --> 00:16:40.749
you're supposed to talk about.

00:16:40.749 --> 00:16:42.290
Especially in a show
like this, where

00:16:42.290 --> 00:16:44.390
it takes place in a
gentrifying area, where

00:16:44.390 --> 00:16:45.565
everyone is clashing.

00:16:45.565 --> 00:16:46.440
You know what I mean?

00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:47.750
And you've got to talk about it.

00:16:47.750 --> 00:16:50.000
DAVID KOECHNER: I think we
do a pretty good job of not

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.040
making the decision for
the audience either.

00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:55.610
We bring up other
sides of an argument,

00:16:55.610 --> 00:17:00.740
or an idea, or a
cultural difference.

00:17:00.740 --> 00:17:04.829
But we don't make a
resolution for everybody,

00:17:04.829 --> 00:17:08.210
which I think is probably more
satisfying for an audience

00:17:08.210 --> 00:17:10.290
that we're not
preaching to them.

00:17:10.290 --> 00:17:13.130
So we're all like, most
Americans, there are two sides

00:17:13.130 --> 00:17:14.470
to look at.

00:17:14.470 --> 00:17:17.180
And so, I think we do a
pretty good job of bringing up

00:17:17.180 --> 00:17:17.681
both sides.

00:17:17.681 --> 00:17:19.305
MAZ JOBRANI: And the
writers, you know?

00:17:19.305 --> 00:17:21.980
Early on last season, there was
an article written in the "New

00:17:21.980 --> 00:17:25.170
York Times," and there's
been several articles

00:17:25.170 --> 00:17:28.855
like this throughout, for the
depiction of Arab-Americans,

00:17:28.855 --> 00:17:30.230
Iranian-Americans,
Middle-Eastern

00:17:30.230 --> 00:17:32.860
Americans, Muslim Americans,
in film and television,

00:17:32.860 --> 00:17:34.980
and how negative
those depictions are.

00:17:34.980 --> 00:17:37.850
I remember I got that article
and I took it to the writers.

00:17:37.850 --> 00:17:39.800
And Bob Daily, who's
the showrunner,

00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:42.470
said, oh, I already saw this
and I've already spread it out

00:17:42.470 --> 00:17:44.180
amongst all the writers.

00:17:44.180 --> 00:17:46.820
So that was good for me to hear.

00:17:46.820 --> 00:17:49.110
And so one of the
things they try to do--

00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:52.160
and I've encouraged
them to when they write,

00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:54.440
and I get happy
when they do-- is

00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:58.100
they don't necessarily just base
the jokes on your background

00:17:58.100 --> 00:17:58.894
or your ethnicity.

00:17:58.894 --> 00:18:00.810
And just because you're
of a certain ethnicity

00:18:00.810 --> 00:18:03.360
doesn't mean that you're
going to think a certain way.

00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:04.670
JERMAINE FOWLER: Not
going to be a stereotype.

00:18:04.670 --> 00:18:06.128
MAZ JOBRANI: So
that's kind of cool

00:18:06.128 --> 00:18:08.060
when they have
something like, again,

00:18:08.060 --> 00:18:11.090
if the guy's a jerk, he's
just a jerk, whether he's Arab

00:18:11.090 --> 00:18:14.000
or not, or white or
black or whatever.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:15.770
And if he's cool,
he's just cool.

00:18:15.770 --> 00:18:16.970
And in the end--

00:18:16.970 --> 00:18:21.050
because I play the nemesis.

00:18:21.050 --> 00:18:23.450
You know, the guy
who kind of wants

00:18:23.450 --> 00:18:26.940
to buy the donut shop from
Judd Hirsch's character.

00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:32.630
In the end, there are
episodes where we all

00:18:32.630 --> 00:18:34.040
have each other's back.

00:18:34.040 --> 00:18:35.940
So, it is a community,
even if there's

00:18:35.940 --> 00:18:37.610
some of that stuff happening.

00:18:37.610 --> 00:18:37.940
SPEAKER 2: That's cool.

00:18:37.940 --> 00:18:39.320
DAVID KOECHNER: Really,
I guess, so you're

00:18:39.320 --> 00:18:40.236
asking the difference.

00:18:40.236 --> 00:18:42.310
Our show, Lilly, is a cultural--

00:18:42.310 --> 00:18:46.370
SPEAKER 2: [? Lilly. ?]
Cultural barometer for America.

00:18:46.370 --> 00:18:49.670
JERMAINE FOWLER: Listen, every
press stop we go to, Dave--

00:18:49.670 --> 00:18:51.087
boom-- it's the
culture barometer.

00:18:51.087 --> 00:18:52.795
DAVID KOECHNER: Because
it's true, folks.

00:18:52.795 --> 00:18:54.510
MAZ JOBRANI: He's made T-shirts.

00:18:54.510 --> 00:18:56.160
JERMAINE FOWLER: It's the truth.

00:18:56.160 --> 00:18:58.850
MAZ JOBRANI: He's got cultural
barometer t-shirts and hats.

00:18:58.850 --> 00:19:00.391
JERMAINE FOWLER: We
are the new news.

00:19:00.391 --> 00:19:01.240
We are the new news.

00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:04.660
DAVID KOECHNER: Watch
you guys all go, eww.

00:19:04.660 --> 00:19:06.740
We're self-important.

00:19:06.740 --> 00:19:09.560
JERMAINE FOWLER: We like to pat
ourselves on the back a lot.

00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:11.900
SPEAKER 2: Speaking
of self, Maz,

00:19:11.900 --> 00:19:14.795
I know that you spent
some time on the NPR show,

00:19:14.795 --> 00:19:17.170
you've done a couple of Ted
talks, now you're doing this.

00:19:17.170 --> 00:19:18.700
Tell us more about--

00:19:18.700 --> 00:19:20.460
which, love Ted talks.

00:19:20.460 --> 00:19:21.490
JERMAINE FOWLER: I didn't know
you did a fucking Ted Talk.

00:19:21.490 --> 00:19:23.080
MAZ JOBRANI: I did
two of them, man.

00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:23.920
JERMAINE FOWLER: Send
me the link, man.

00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:24.790
MAZ JOBRANI: You
got to look me up.

00:19:24.790 --> 00:19:25.920
JERMAINE FOWLER: I will, man.

00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:27.253
MAZ JOBRANI: Have you IMDB'd me?

00:19:27.253 --> 00:19:30.690
I am the cultural
barometer of this show.

00:19:30.690 --> 00:19:32.292
JERMAINE FOWLER: I
did not know that.

00:19:32.292 --> 00:19:33.500
That's awesome.

00:19:33.500 --> 00:19:34.140
MAZ JOBRANI: What
was the question?

00:19:34.140 --> 00:19:35.515
SPEAKER 2: The
question was just,

00:19:35.515 --> 00:19:38.350
how does this show, this role--

00:19:38.350 --> 00:19:42.350
how are you using it as a
part of your overall career

00:19:42.350 --> 00:19:44.185
or another sounding board?

00:19:44.185 --> 00:19:45.910
Or just, in relation
to most other things

00:19:45.910 --> 00:19:48.735
you do, how does this relate?

00:19:48.735 --> 00:19:50.110
MAZ JOBRANI: The
beauty of it is,

00:19:50.110 --> 00:19:52.750
we are doing what we love doing,
as I'm sure a lot of you guys

00:19:52.750 --> 00:19:53.249
are.

00:19:53.249 --> 00:19:55.810
My parents, being
immigrant parents,

00:19:55.810 --> 00:19:58.450
wanted me to be a
lawyer or a doctor.

00:19:58.450 --> 00:20:00.040
And I did not go that path.

00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:01.000
I became an actor.

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:04.954
And in that, I've been able to
do acting and stand-up comedy

00:20:04.954 --> 00:20:05.620
in "Wait Wait...

00:20:05.620 --> 00:20:08.530
Don't Tell Me!", which is a
radio show, and the Ted talks,

00:20:08.530 --> 00:20:11.730
which is me presenting things.

00:20:11.730 --> 00:20:16.810
So, it's all part
of the same thing.

00:20:16.810 --> 00:20:19.930
And the underlying theme
of a lot of stuff that I do

00:20:19.930 --> 00:20:24.520
is, I try to represent myself in
a good way, in a positive way,

00:20:24.520 --> 00:20:26.319
in a different way.

00:20:26.319 --> 00:20:28.360
As we know, there's a lot
of negative stereotypes

00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:31.310
of people from Middle
Eastern backgrounds.

00:20:31.310 --> 00:20:34.450
And there's a big push,
an anti-immigrant push,

00:20:34.450 --> 00:20:35.920
in this country currently.

00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:40.780
I mean, some guy in Kansas
shot two Indian dudes.

00:20:40.780 --> 00:20:44.020
Killed one, and
then told somebody

00:20:44.020 --> 00:20:46.090
that he had shot two Iranians.

00:20:46.090 --> 00:20:47.740
He got the wrong
people first of all.

00:20:47.740 --> 00:20:49.865
They hadn't done anything,
they were just at a bar.

00:20:49.865 --> 00:20:51.490
And this guy was
just some crazy dude.

00:20:51.490 --> 00:20:52.990
And this kind of
stuff is happening.

00:20:52.990 --> 00:20:56.470
So, my hope, in the long
run, is that the more

00:20:56.470 --> 00:21:01.460
we get people of different
backgrounds in the media,

00:21:01.460 --> 00:21:03.730
the more people can
judge for themselves.

00:21:03.730 --> 00:21:05.320
And see, and go, oh,
wow, these people

00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:08.410
are just ordinary people.

00:21:08.410 --> 00:21:10.270
When I did my first
stand-up special,

00:21:10.270 --> 00:21:12.103
which was "The Axis of
Evil Comedy Special,"

00:21:12.103 --> 00:21:13.810
one of the comments we got was--

00:21:13.810 --> 00:21:15.850
because it wasn't
just for comedians

00:21:15.850 --> 00:21:18.500
of Middle Eastern-American
backgrounds performing.

00:21:18.500 --> 00:21:20.890
There was Middle
Easterners in the audience.

00:21:20.890 --> 00:21:22.970
And we got some
emails saying, wow,

00:21:22.970 --> 00:21:24.820
I didn't know you
people laughed.

00:21:24.820 --> 00:21:25.670
And it was true.

00:21:25.670 --> 00:21:29.910
You don't see our people
laughing anywhere.

00:21:29.910 --> 00:21:31.731
Except an evil
like, [EVIL LAUGH],,

00:21:31.731 --> 00:21:33.480
you know? (IRANIAN
ACCENT) I will kill you

00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:34.370
in the name of Allah!

00:21:34.370 --> 00:21:35.880
JERMAINE FOWLER: There it is.

00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:36.880
MAZ JOBRANI: That, they've seen.

00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:39.171
But they've never seen a guy
just be like, [LAUGHING]..

00:21:39.171 --> 00:21:41.410
And that's another reason
why I like this character.

00:21:41.410 --> 00:21:43.970
As much as this
character, like I said,

00:21:43.970 --> 00:21:48.760
says a lot of
inappropriate stuff,

00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:50.500
they give me some
funny lines to say.

00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:52.750
So end of the day, if people
are watching it and going

00:21:52.750 --> 00:21:55.124
like, oh, that dude made me
laugh, and he's got an accent

00:21:55.124 --> 00:21:56.958
and he seems like he's
from an Arab country.

00:21:56.958 --> 00:21:58.290
Well, you know, that'd be great.

00:21:58.290 --> 00:22:00.100
If people like that
character, then that's

00:22:00.100 --> 00:22:01.180
one little [INTERPOSING VOICES].

00:22:01.180 --> 00:22:03.305
JERMAINE FOWLER: You also
come from a conservative,

00:22:03.305 --> 00:22:05.200
you have a
conservative viewpoint.

00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:06.060
MAZ JOBRANI: Yeah, he's got
a conservative viewpoint,

00:22:06.060 --> 00:22:07.120
this character.

00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:08.110
JERMAINE FOWLER: Yeah,
the Iraqi guy on our show

00:22:08.110 --> 00:22:09.220
has a conservative viewpoint.

00:22:09.220 --> 00:22:10.845
And it's so funny,
because he basically

00:22:10.845 --> 00:22:14.745
thinks the way most
Americans might think.

00:22:14.745 --> 00:22:16.620
They might see some
similarities in this guy,

00:22:16.620 --> 00:22:19.365
it's just so cool that it comes
from a Middle Eastern fellow.

00:22:19.365 --> 00:22:20.740
DAVID KOECHNER:
And a real place.

00:22:20.740 --> 00:22:21.910
JERMAINE FOWLER:
And a real place.

00:22:21.910 --> 00:22:22.540
DAVID KOECHNER: With Maz.

00:22:22.540 --> 00:22:24.627
MAZ JOBRANI: I'm definitely
very conservative now.

00:22:24.627 --> 00:22:25.960
That's actually fun for me, too.

00:22:25.960 --> 00:22:28.570
I get to play a character that's
very different than who I am.

00:22:28.570 --> 00:22:31.640
So I get to lampoon
it on a weekly basis.

00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:33.890
JERMAINE FOWLER: Koechner,
yours is very close to you.

00:22:33.890 --> 00:22:35.450
DAVID KOECHNER: Yes.

Disenfranchised

SPEAKER 2: Let's talk
about the set, right?

00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:43.755
So here at Google, we're always
talking about being authentic,

00:22:43.755 --> 00:22:44.380
being yourself.

00:22:44.380 --> 00:22:45.880
You guys clearly
are very authentic.

00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:48.040
You started very
authentic, you are.

00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:51.280
But I'd love to know how
that parlays into how

00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:52.420
you interact on the set.

00:22:52.420 --> 00:22:54.670
And I'm actually going to
direct this question to Rell

00:22:54.670 --> 00:22:56.530
because you're right next to me.

00:22:56.530 --> 00:22:59.320
I know that you wrote a
show for Comedy Central

00:22:59.320 --> 00:23:01.600
and you've had that
experience, and obviously

00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:03.820
several stand-up
comedy experiences.

00:23:03.820 --> 00:23:06.340
For yourself, when you go
into work, and it's like, OK,

00:23:06.340 --> 00:23:12.400
it's showtime, how do you
bring your authentic uniqueness

00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:13.160
to your role?

00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:17.350
RELL BATTLE: Well, my
character's name is Sweatpants.

00:23:17.350 --> 00:23:19.140
I got a cousin named Lil Pookie.

00:23:22.366 --> 00:23:23.740
Well, what it is
is I get to be--

00:23:23.740 --> 00:23:24.448
I don't have to--

00:23:24.448 --> 00:23:27.100
I probably have the
easiest job of everybody.

00:23:27.100 --> 00:23:30.850
Because I know a
thousand cool dudes who

00:23:30.850 --> 00:23:33.035
just smoke a lot of
pot and living off

of their best friend, you know?

00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:35.180
I was that guy.

00:23:35.180 --> 00:23:36.040
I went to the
University of Maryland.

00:23:36.040 --> 00:23:36.610
Any Terps?

00:23:36.610 --> 00:23:36.940
Just me?

00:23:36.940 --> 00:23:37.440
Cool.

00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:38.470
You a Terp?

00:23:38.470 --> 00:23:39.373
Hell, yeah.

Are you serious?

Yo, what up, man?

00:23:42.010 --> 00:23:43.801
RELL BATTLE: Jermaine
didn't go to college.

00:23:45.720 --> 00:23:48.380
JERMAINE FOWLER: I worked around
there at the dry cleaners.

MAZ JOBRANI: In real life, he's
Sweatpants and you're Franco.

00:23:53.772 --> 00:23:55.630
He was sleeping in your--

00:23:55.630 --> 00:23:59.940
RELL BATTLE: But you
know, I got the cool job.

00:23:59.940 --> 00:24:01.690
Just coming in and
saying something funny,

00:24:01.690 --> 00:24:02.356
and getting out.

00:24:02.356 --> 00:24:05.050
I get to be free and loose
and as goofy as I want to be.

00:24:05.050 --> 00:24:07.090
And just be a slacker.

00:24:07.090 --> 00:24:09.790
So it's not hard for any kid
that was smoking a lot of weed

00:24:09.790 --> 00:24:10.510
back in college.

00:24:10.510 --> 00:24:13.660
So I have the
easiest of the jobs.

00:24:13.660 --> 00:24:17.116
But that person is represented
in every city, any good friend,

00:24:17.116 --> 00:24:17.990
you know what I mean?

00:24:17.990 --> 00:24:19.510
My job is to be loyal
to Franco's character

00:24:19.510 --> 00:24:21.162
and I think I'm a
pretty loyal friend.

00:24:21.162 --> 00:24:22.120
So, I got the easiest--

00:24:22.120 --> 00:24:23.150
I think I got the easiest job.

00:24:23.150 --> 00:24:24.150

David, what about you?

00:24:29.820 --> 00:24:30.820
DAVID KOECHNER: Oh, yes.

SPEAKER 2: Same questions.

00:24:31.900 --> 00:24:32.710
DAVID KOECHNER:
What was the exact--

00:24:32.710 --> 00:24:34.750
SPEAKER 2: The question
was, how can you break--

00:24:34.750 --> 00:24:36.916
DAVID KOECHNER: Can you
restate the question please?

00:24:38.390 --> 00:24:41.740
SPEAKER 2: How do you bring
your uniqueness to your role?

00:24:43.990 --> 00:24:45.490
DAVID KOECHNER: I
guess because I've

00:24:45.490 --> 00:24:48.430
been doing this for
30 years, there's

00:24:48.430 --> 00:24:50.590
only one way I
know how to do it.

00:24:50.590 --> 00:24:54.860
No, I was fortunate
enough to just get hired.

00:24:54.860 --> 00:25:01.630
And so they allowed me to find
certain quirks and mannerisms

00:25:01.630 --> 00:25:05.330
in the character that
reflected my personality.

00:25:05.330 --> 00:25:08.380
And I think I'm a
good enough actor

00:25:08.380 --> 00:25:11.320
to understand what they needed
from me, script-wise, too.

00:25:11.320 --> 00:25:13.190
So I would say that's it.

00:25:13.190 --> 00:25:14.910

You know what's funny is
when I first got the job,

00:26:00.790 --> 00:26:02.470
I was extremely nervous.

It was my first
multi-cam sitcom role.

And I was like, all right,
just copy Katey and Judd.

00:26:07.900 --> 00:26:09.040
Just copy Katey and Judd.

what multi-cam sitcom means.

00:26:20.710 --> 00:26:21.820
JERMAINE FOWLER: "Master
of None," "Cheers."

00:26:21.820 --> 00:26:23.740
Single cam, "Master
of None," and you

00:26:23.740 --> 00:26:25.370
got "Cheers," multi-cam.

00:26:25.370 --> 00:26:26.740
There we go.

00:26:26.740 --> 00:26:27.430
I was nervous.

00:26:27.430 --> 00:26:29.770
And I realized that,
all right, cool.

00:26:29.770 --> 00:26:33.700
What similarities do I have
with the character and myself?

00:26:33.700 --> 00:26:37.720
I used to be broke, looking
for a job around Maryland.

00:26:37.720 --> 00:26:39.850
I used that desperation
for the pilot.

00:26:39.850 --> 00:26:43.480
And as the season went on, we
used different subject matter

00:26:43.480 --> 00:26:44.752
and different storylines.

00:26:44.752 --> 00:26:46.210
I always tried to
find similarities

00:26:46.210 --> 00:26:49.450
within the plots and the
scenes that I could relate to.

00:26:49.450 --> 00:26:51.550
And I always brought
that to the scenes.

00:26:51.550 --> 00:26:53.480
But Judd and Katey, man.

00:26:53.480 --> 00:26:55.630
I really just watched
the hell out of them.

00:26:55.630 --> 00:26:57.650
Shit, when they talk,
I shut the hell up.

00:26:57.650 --> 00:26:59.470
SPEAKER 2: Awesome.

00:26:59.470 --> 00:27:00.892
And Maz, what about yourself?

00:27:00.892 --> 00:27:02.350
I think you've kind
of answered it,

00:27:02.350 --> 00:27:04.220
but I didn't want
to neglect you.

00:27:04.220 --> 00:27:06.312
MAZ JOBRANI: No, no,
ask your next question

00:27:06.312 --> 00:27:08.020
because I thought I
did answer it, right?

00:27:08.020 --> 00:27:08.190
Yeah.

00:27:08.190 --> 00:27:09.396
SPEAKER 2: All right, cool.

00:27:09.396 --> 00:27:12.220
MAZ JOBRANI: No,
I'm being efficient.

00:27:12.220 --> 00:27:15.230
SPEAKER 2: The next
season is coming out.

00:27:15.230 --> 00:27:17.976
What do you want
us, as Googlers--

00:27:17.976 --> 00:27:20.350
and Googlers is the term we
use for ourselves internally.

00:27:20.350 --> 00:27:21.225
JERMAINE FOWLER: Ooh.

00:27:21.225 --> 00:27:23.700
SPEAKER 2: Yeah, you guys
are on the inside now.

00:27:23.700 --> 00:27:25.830
Googlers.

00:27:25.830 --> 00:27:28.320
What messaging do you want
us, as Googlers, to know?

00:27:28.320 --> 00:27:30.270
And what would you
encourage us to--

00:27:30.270 --> 00:27:31.811
I mean, obviously,
look at the show--

00:27:31.811 --> 00:27:34.690
but what should we know about
this next season coming out?

00:27:34.690 --> 00:27:35.730
DAVID KOECHNER: We just
want you to live tweet it

00:27:35.730 --> 00:27:36.330
during the show.

00:27:36.330 --> 00:27:36.920
RELL BATTLE: That'd be great.

00:27:36.920 --> 00:27:37.836
That'd be really cool.

00:27:39.990 --> 00:27:43.050
MAZ JOBRANI: I'm a big fan of
all the serialized shows that

00:27:43.050 --> 00:27:43.924
are out there.

00:27:43.924 --> 00:27:45.840
The "Game of Thrones"
and the "House of Cards"

00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:46.670
and all those shows.

00:27:46.670 --> 00:27:47.820
JERMAINE FOWLER:
"Rick and Morty."

00:27:47.820 --> 00:27:50.310
MAZ JOBRANI: But this is a
show that's not serialized.

00:27:50.310 --> 00:27:53.460
It's a show that you can tune
in, watch a few episodes,

00:27:53.460 --> 00:27:55.510
and then skip to
the next, whatever.

00:27:55.510 --> 00:27:58.093
JERMAINE FOWLER: You can watch
it while you're washing dishes.

00:27:58.093 --> 00:27:59.400
MAZ JOBRANI: Jump around.

00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:02.190
I honestly feel the writers have
done a great job this season

00:28:02.190 --> 00:28:04.100
of doing some
really funny stuff.

00:28:04.100 --> 00:28:08.220
There was scripts that I read
before we did the table read,

00:28:08.220 --> 00:28:09.420
and I was laughing out loud.

00:28:09.420 --> 00:28:11.294
So there was some good,
funny stuff in there.

00:28:11.294 --> 00:28:14.550
So it's a good way to get
some light entertainment

00:28:14.550 --> 00:28:18.180
while we touch on some serious
subjects, but in a light way.

00:28:18.180 --> 00:28:20.100
And hey, everybody
needs to laugh.

00:28:20.100 --> 00:28:23.250
I mean, the world is
crazier than ever.

00:28:23.250 --> 00:28:27.660
So once you've been bombarded
with your daily news

00:28:27.660 --> 00:28:30.360
about Trump and
Russia and Korea,

00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:32.780
and wherever else
we're going to--

00:28:32.780 --> 00:28:34.541
tune in to us and
laugh a little bit.

00:28:34.541 --> 00:28:36.540
DAVID KOECHNER: Is it too
much to say we're here

00:28:36.540 --> 00:28:38.420
to unburden you of your pain?

00:28:40.690 --> 00:28:41.940
MAZ JOBRANI: Social barometer.

00:28:41.940 --> 00:28:42.439
What was it?

00:28:42.439 --> 00:28:43.231
What was your word?

00:28:43.231 --> 00:28:44.688
DAVID KOECHNER:
Cultural barometer.

00:28:44.688 --> 00:28:46.290
MAZ JOBRANI: Cultural barometer.

00:28:46.290 --> 00:28:49.170
JERMAINE FOWLER: Katey Sagal
plays a cop, and she's awesome.

00:28:49.170 --> 00:28:50.790
Judd Hirsch is cooking donuts.

00:28:50.790 --> 00:28:51.945
Watch the damn show.

00:28:51.945 --> 00:28:53.275
It's going to be really good.

00:28:53.275 --> 00:28:54.150
SPEAKER 2: Very cool.

00:28:54.150 --> 00:28:55.920
We're super excited
that you took some time.

00:28:55.920 --> 00:28:57.878
We know this has been a
super long day for you,

00:28:57.878 --> 00:29:00.147
so thank you for coming
here to talk to us.

00:29:00.147 --> 00:29:01.980
And it's not just,
obviously, this audience,

00:29:01.980 --> 00:29:04.200
but a lot of people are
going to be seeing this

00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:06.241
throughout Google, so we
just really appreciate--

00:29:06.241 --> 00:29:08.735
you guys are hilarious.

00:29:08.735 --> 00:29:10.734
And it's awesome to hear
that you guys are going

00:29:10.734 --> 00:29:12.942
to be at Zanies tonight
because it sounds like that's

00:29:12.942 --> 00:29:14.510
going to be a really good time.

00:29:14.510 --> 00:29:16.718
JERMAINE FOWLER: The show
is sold out, so that sucks.

00:29:16.718 --> 00:29:18.552
Y'all can, I guess,
come afterwards and--

00:29:18.552 --> 00:29:19.760
MAZ JOBRANI: Just Google us--

00:29:19.760 --> 00:29:20.510
JERMAINE FOWLER: --say hi.

00:29:20.510 --> 00:29:22.260
MAZ JOBRANI: --the
next time you want

00:29:22.260 --> 00:29:24.989
to see us live, just Google
us and you'll see us.

00:29:24.989 --> 00:29:26.030
JERMAINE FOWLER: Or Bing.

00:29:26.030 --> 00:29:27.100
Bing is pretty hot, you know?

00:29:27.100 --> 00:29:27.620
SPEAKER 2: What?

00:29:27.620 --> 00:29:28.030
JERMAINE FOWLER: Remember Bing?

00:29:28.030 --> 00:29:28.260
SPEAKER 2: Who?

00:29:28.260 --> 00:29:30.145
DAVID KOECHNER: That's
a curse word here.

00:29:30.145 --> 00:29:32.490
JERMAINE FOWLER:
I'm fucking around.

00:29:32.490 --> 00:29:33.720
What happened to Bing?

00:29:33.720 --> 00:29:34.590
Did y'all kill Bing?

00:29:34.590 --> 00:29:37.584
RELL BATTLE: Of course they
killed Bing, they're Google.

00:29:37.584 --> 00:29:39.000
JERMAINE FOWLER:
I was auditioning

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:41.416
for a Bing commercial back in
like [? 2013 ?] or something

00:29:41.416 --> 00:29:42.000
like that.

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:44.852
MAZ JOBRANI: Bing bombed,
that's what happened.

00:29:44.852 --> 00:29:46.330
Bing bomb.

00:29:46.330 --> 00:29:46.830
I heard it.

00:29:46.830 --> 00:29:47.390
They're done.

00:29:47.390 --> 00:29:48.240
SPEAKER 2: So we
are going to give

00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:50.526
the audience an opportunity
to ask a few questions.

00:29:50.526 --> 00:29:51.900
I know I've been
dominating here,

00:29:51.900 --> 00:29:53.441
but that's what I
was supposed to do.

00:29:53.441 --> 00:29:55.364
So if anybody has
questions, just because this

00:29:55.364 --> 00:29:57.030
is being recorded,
we would like for you

00:29:57.030 --> 00:30:01.335
to go to the microphone
in the middle.

00:30:01.335 --> 00:30:03.460
RELL BATTLE: Don't all jump
at the same time, guys.

00:30:03.460 --> 00:30:04.918
JERMAINE FOWLER:
He already did it.

00:30:07.839 --> 00:30:09.880
AUDIENCE: My question is
actually for [? Lila. ?]

00:30:09.880 --> 00:30:12.799
Where did you get those
googly sneakers from?

00:30:12.799 --> 00:30:14.590
RELL BATTLE: I was
thinking the same thing.

00:30:14.590 --> 00:30:15.650
Are those Pumas?

00:30:15.650 --> 00:30:17.050
My sisters would love those.

00:30:17.050 --> 00:30:19.410
SPEAKER 2: Nordstrom.

00:30:19.410 --> 00:30:21.160
JERMAINE FOWLER:
Are those Sauconys?

00:30:21.160 --> 00:30:24.200
SPEAKER 2: I don't know
if I can say the brand.

00:30:24.200 --> 00:30:27.435
JERMAINE FOWLER: They're Bings.

00:30:27.435 --> 00:30:28.870
SPEAKER 2: You're so awesome.

00:30:28.870 --> 00:30:29.830
JERMAINE FOWLER:
What's up, buddy?

00:30:29.830 --> 00:30:31.080
AUDIENCE: Hey, quick question.

00:30:31.080 --> 00:30:33.040
So being comedians
on a comedy show,

00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:35.625
and having written your
own stuff in the past,

00:30:35.625 --> 00:30:37.750
do you ever find yourself
funnier than the writers?

00:30:37.750 --> 00:30:42.026
And then do you guys get input
into really re-crafting some?

00:30:42.026 --> 00:30:42.900
JERMAINE FOWLER: Yes.

00:30:42.900 --> 00:30:44.230
As a stand-up comic, I hate--

00:30:44.230 --> 00:30:45.929
RELL BATTLE: I plead the Fifth.

00:30:45.929 --> 00:30:47.220
JERMAINE FOWLER: Come on, Rell.

00:30:47.220 --> 00:30:48.700
I honestly do, sometimes.

00:30:48.700 --> 00:30:49.690
Because you're a comic.

00:30:49.690 --> 00:30:51.400
You've been writing
your stuff for years.

00:30:51.400 --> 00:30:54.160
Then-- I'm very
selfish sometimes,

00:30:54.160 --> 00:30:55.679
when it comes to my comedy.

00:30:55.679 --> 00:30:57.220
I just want to make
sure whatever I'm

00:30:57.220 --> 00:30:58.386
saying is going to be funny.

00:30:58.386 --> 00:31:01.210
But you just want to
have some sort of control

00:31:01.210 --> 00:31:03.040
over what you're saying.

00:31:03.040 --> 00:31:04.270
They do a good job, honestly.

00:31:04.270 --> 00:31:05.040
They're really, really funny.

00:31:05.040 --> 00:31:06.620
RELL BATTLE: We all want to lift
the material any way we can,

00:31:06.620 --> 00:31:07.139
if we can.

00:31:07.139 --> 00:31:08.930
We always want to do
the best job possible,

00:31:08.930 --> 00:31:09.971
have the best show on TV.

00:31:09.971 --> 00:31:12.160
JERMAINE FOWLER: That's
because we're stand-ups.

00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:13.660
RELL BATTLE: And it's like
having four extra writers,

00:31:13.660 --> 00:31:14.250
really.

00:31:14.250 --> 00:31:15.700
If you really think about it.

00:31:15.700 --> 00:31:17.350
Now, if we get to
keep our stuff,

00:31:17.350 --> 00:31:18.721
that's a different story.

00:31:18.721 --> 00:31:20.470
MAZ JOBRANI: They allow
us, on show night,

00:31:20.470 --> 00:31:22.657
to maybe do a take with
some of the ideas we have.

00:31:22.657 --> 00:31:24.240
JERMAINE FOWLER:
Crazy take, fun take.

00:31:24.240 --> 00:31:26.198
MAZ JOBRANI: But there's
a lot of good writers,

00:31:26.198 --> 00:31:29.222
so even show night, they come
up with alternative lines.

00:31:29.222 --> 00:31:30.680
JERMAINE FOWLER:
There's 14 writers

00:31:30.680 --> 00:31:33.160
and it all gets filtered, and
it's a very collaborative show.

00:31:33.160 --> 00:31:34.710
Everybody wants the
show to be good,

00:31:34.710 --> 00:31:37.840
and as long as it gets that
way, then we're just fine.

00:31:37.840 --> 00:31:38.590
AUDIENCE: Dynamic.

00:31:38.590 --> 00:31:39.070
JERMAINE FOWLER: Uh-huh.

00:31:39.070 --> 00:31:39.430
As hell.

00:31:39.430 --> 00:31:41.055
DAVID KOECHNER: The
format lends itself

00:31:41.055 --> 00:31:44.800
to a certain style of comedy
that we all know we're in for.

00:31:44.800 --> 00:31:45.420
So--

00:31:45.420 --> 00:31:47.410
RELL BATTLE: Are they
going to watch this?

00:31:47.410 --> 00:31:49.645
Never mind, nope.

00:31:49.645 --> 00:31:51.020
DAVID KOECHNER:
They might still,

00:31:51.020 --> 00:31:52.040
but we didn't say anything bad.

00:31:52.040 --> 00:31:52.310
RELL BATTLE: Neh-mind.

00:31:52.310 --> 00:31:52.816
Nope.

00:31:52.816 --> 00:31:54.440
SPEAKER 2: Did you
just say "neh-mind"?

00:31:54.440 --> 00:31:55.130
RELL BATTLE: Never mind.

00:31:55.130 --> 00:31:56.170
SPEAKER 2: Did you
just pull off the E-R--

00:31:56.170 --> 00:31:57.654
RELL BATTLE: It's after 1:00.

00:31:57.654 --> 00:31:59.714
After 1:00.

00:31:59.714 --> 00:32:02.130
AUDIENCE: I know you guys have
been in the stand-up comedy

00:32:02.130 --> 00:32:03.900
game for a long time
and it's a long road

00:32:03.900 --> 00:32:05.400
to get where you
guys are now today,

00:32:05.400 --> 00:32:07.230
so I was wondering
if one of you could

00:32:07.230 --> 00:32:10.470
share a story of the early days
of when you were starting off.

00:32:10.470 --> 00:32:14.280
Any bad gigs you had
or memorable, bizarre

00:32:14.280 --> 00:32:16.350
experiences starting
out on the road?

00:32:16.350 --> 00:32:17.990
JERMAINE FOWLER: Oh, man.

00:32:17.990 --> 00:32:19.860
MAZ JOBRANI: There's
all kinds of them, man.

00:32:19.860 --> 00:32:21.818
Because the thing is,
when you first start out,

00:32:21.818 --> 00:32:24.300
you gig everywhere you can.

00:32:24.300 --> 00:32:29.060
Coffee shops, bars,
church basements.

00:32:29.060 --> 00:32:31.410
I did a church basement
where there was

00:32:31.410 --> 00:32:33.130
eight people in the audience.

00:32:33.130 --> 00:32:35.821
And then I realized they
were all there to perform,

00:32:35.821 --> 00:32:36.820
so we would just rotate.

00:32:36.820 --> 00:32:38.430
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:38.430 --> 00:32:39.360
We would rotate.

00:32:39.360 --> 00:32:42.830
You'd finish, you'd sit,
the next guy would come up.

00:32:42.830 --> 00:32:44.580
You felt bad leaving,
because you're like,

00:32:44.580 --> 00:32:48.240
oh, he watched mine,
I'll watch his.

00:32:48.240 --> 00:32:51.510
JERMAINE FOWLER: I did
a country club and just

00:32:51.510 --> 00:32:53.160
a bunch of old white dudes, man.

00:32:53.160 --> 00:32:55.410
And my comedy ain't for them.

00:32:55.410 --> 00:32:59.550
So I did it and I bombed
so bad, I told the booker,

00:32:59.550 --> 00:33:00.390
keep the money.

00:33:00.390 --> 00:33:02.430
I needed the money for rent.

00:33:02.430 --> 00:33:04.782
And he was like, OK.

00:33:04.782 --> 00:33:06.240
MAZ JOBRANI: So he
agreed with you.

00:33:06.240 --> 00:33:06.930
JERMAINE FOWLER:
He agreed with me.

00:33:06.930 --> 00:33:08.535
He kept the money, man.

00:33:11.212 --> 00:33:13.170
DAVID KOECHNER: I started
in sketch and improv,

00:33:13.170 --> 00:33:14.610
so there's plenty
of nights where

00:33:14.610 --> 00:33:16.950
you have a small audience
or some people who

00:33:16.950 --> 00:33:19.480
just aren't down with it.

00:33:19.480 --> 00:33:23.250
The worst one being Mayfield
Park, the racetrack.

00:33:23.250 --> 00:33:24.980
We did a show there.

00:33:24.980 --> 00:33:28.410
The stage was bad, the lights
were bad, the crowd was worse.

00:33:28.410 --> 00:33:29.940
But you don't
blame the audience.

00:33:29.940 --> 00:33:33.180
You've got to find out
where there funny bone is

00:33:33.180 --> 00:33:33.810
and tickle it.

00:33:33.810 --> 00:33:37.334
So not their fault. But
those are always a tough one.

00:33:37.334 --> 00:33:39.000
But at least I had
other people with me.

00:33:42.180 --> 00:33:46.190
RELL BATTLE: I did a Gong Show
at The Comedy Store one time.

00:33:46.190 --> 00:33:47.490
I don't know why I did that.

00:33:47.490 --> 00:33:49.350
And this is like--

00:33:49.350 --> 00:33:52.009
remember Facebook was
just like a college thing?

00:33:52.009 --> 00:33:54.300
And it wasn't like-- the
general public didn't have it.

00:33:54.300 --> 00:33:56.370
Well, nobody told me, right?

00:33:56.370 --> 00:33:59.110
So I'm on this Gong
Show, I do this joke.

00:33:59.110 --> 00:34:01.610
You know, ladies-- it was real
hacky-- ladies, if I send you

00:34:01.610 --> 00:34:05.250
a friends request on Facebook,
and you accept, we together.

00:34:05.250 --> 00:34:08.130
That was the punch--
that was the hit, right?

00:34:08.130 --> 00:34:10.519
And this was killing
in college, right?

00:34:10.519 --> 00:34:13.060
And I do this show and Facebook
hadn't came out at that time.

00:34:13.060 --> 00:34:16.980
And everybody was just
like, what's Facebook?

00:34:16.980 --> 00:34:22.105
And then I heard from the back,
somebody says, next comedian.

00:34:22.105 --> 00:34:26.550
And it was the bouncer of
the comedy club saying that.

00:34:26.550 --> 00:34:29.250
So I stopped doing
comedy for six months.

00:34:29.250 --> 00:34:32.760
JERMAINE FOWLER: That's why
you took the six-month break.

00:34:32.760 --> 00:34:35.040
SPEAKER 2: That leads me
to probably a very obvious

00:34:35.040 --> 00:34:36.389
question around failure, right?

00:34:36.389 --> 00:34:38.400
So many people-- oh,
I'm sorry, go ahead.

00:34:38.400 --> 00:34:39.540
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:34:39.540 --> 00:34:40.469
Kind of related.

00:34:40.469 --> 00:34:42.560
My friend who is
sitting next to me

00:34:42.560 --> 00:34:45.760
is an up-and-coming stand-up
comedian here in Chicago.

00:34:45.760 --> 00:34:47.159
She had to leave for a meeting.

00:34:47.159 --> 00:34:48.059
She wanted to know--

00:34:48.059 --> 00:34:50.100
RELL BATTLE: Why isn't
she up there telling the--

00:34:50.100 --> 00:34:53.650
AUDIENCE: She had to leave
for a very important meeting.

00:34:53.650 --> 00:34:56.159
Do you have any advice
for, specifically women,

00:34:56.159 --> 00:34:58.325
coming up in comedy right now?

00:34:58.325 --> 00:34:59.700
MAZ JOBRANI: Just
get up on stage

00:34:59.700 --> 00:35:02.230
as much as you can and
write as much as you can.

00:35:02.230 --> 00:35:05.100
For a man, woman, child.

00:35:05.100 --> 00:35:07.890
Child, you probably should
be home doing your homework.

00:35:07.890 --> 00:35:09.660
Just get up and write
as much as you can.

00:35:09.660 --> 00:35:10.160
That's it.

00:35:10.160 --> 00:35:12.000
Go, go, go, go,
you figure it out.

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:13.833
JERMAINE FOWLER: Mulaney
gave me some advice

00:35:13.833 --> 00:35:15.110
when I first started.

00:35:15.110 --> 00:35:16.500
MySpace was big.

00:35:16.500 --> 00:35:17.867
I MySpace'd Mulaney.

00:35:17.867 --> 00:35:19.200
Hey man, you're from Georgetown.

00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:19.815
I live in DC.

00:35:22.455 --> 00:35:24.070
How do I get big or whatever.

00:35:24.070 --> 00:35:28.040
And he's like, well, you
know, if you're not writing,

00:35:28.040 --> 00:35:29.290
get on stage.

00:35:29.290 --> 00:35:31.530
If you're not on stage,
make sure you write.

00:35:31.530 --> 00:35:33.780
And it was the most
simple concept.

00:35:33.780 --> 00:35:34.770
I was like, oh.

00:35:34.770 --> 00:35:36.910
And it's one thing
people forget.

00:35:36.910 --> 00:35:39.390
Just write and get on stage.

00:35:39.390 --> 00:35:39.940
Fail.

00:35:39.940 --> 00:35:41.160
You've got to fail.

00:35:41.160 --> 00:35:47.000
The more you experience
success early on,

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:49.459
when failure hits you, you're
not going to be ready for it.

00:35:49.459 --> 00:35:51.083
It's just going to
hit you really hard.

00:35:51.083 --> 00:35:52.260
So bomb as much as you can.

00:35:52.260 --> 00:35:55.560
Find yourself early, so
when those opportunities

00:35:55.560 --> 00:35:57.510
come your way you'll
know how to deal with it.

00:35:57.510 --> 00:35:58.010
Bless you.

00:35:58.010 --> 00:36:00.030
MAZ JOBRANI: Excuse me.

00:36:00.030 --> 00:36:01.700
JERMAINE FOWLER: And
that's my advice.

00:36:04.750 --> 00:36:07.500
AUDIENCE: Between networks
and Netflix and Hulu,

00:36:07.500 --> 00:36:11.040
do you guys think that
there's too much TV and video

00:36:11.040 --> 00:36:12.930
content right now?

00:36:12.930 --> 00:36:14.850
RELL BATTLE: I actually
think there is.

00:36:14.850 --> 00:36:18.150
I think stand-up is really
over-saturated, personally.

00:36:18.150 --> 00:36:19.560
I think it's too much.

00:36:19.560 --> 00:36:23.130
At the same time, we
can all work way more.

00:36:23.130 --> 00:36:26.280
I just think, as a fan, I'm
like, oh, this is watered down

00:36:26.280 --> 00:36:29.205
and it's very hard to find,
I think, quality stuff.

00:36:29.205 --> 00:36:30.980
As an actor, as a
comedian, great.

00:36:30.980 --> 00:36:32.160
Keep giving us money.

00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:34.145
So if I wasn't a comedian,
I would be like--

00:36:34.145 --> 00:36:35.520
I don't know what
you guys think,

00:36:35.520 --> 00:36:37.570
I can't tell from
that perspective.

00:36:37.570 --> 00:36:39.710
But to me, I think it is a lot.

00:36:39.710 --> 00:36:42.491
JERMAINE FOWLER: It's weird
because every big movie comes

00:36:42.491 --> 00:36:42.990
out--

00:36:47.490 --> 00:36:49.630
a good one comes out
like twice a month.

00:36:49.630 --> 00:36:52.565
And Netflix puts out a special
once every Tuesday or so.

00:36:52.565 --> 00:36:54.440
RELL BATTLE: A Netflix
movie every freaking--

00:36:54.440 --> 00:36:55.648
JERMAINE FOWLER: And special.

00:36:55.648 --> 00:36:57.810
It gets a little too much
because you can't really

00:36:57.810 --> 00:36:58.770
keep up.

00:36:58.770 --> 00:37:00.850
And that just
over-saturates the market.

00:37:00.850 --> 00:37:07.150
You can't really enjoy one
or find your guy or the one

00:37:07.150 --> 00:37:10.097
you want to watch,
when one in your queue

00:37:10.097 --> 00:37:12.180
gets flushed over because
another one's popped up.

00:37:12.180 --> 00:37:13.361
And it's a lot.

00:37:13.361 --> 00:37:14.610
It's a lot of stand-up comedy.

00:37:14.610 --> 00:37:15.790
RELL BATTLE: I just
start watching "Curb."

00:37:15.790 --> 00:37:17.530
I'm never going to get
to "Stranger Things."

00:37:17.530 --> 00:37:18.210
You know what I'm saying?

00:37:18.210 --> 00:37:18.860
I'm stuck.

00:37:18.860 --> 00:37:19.140
What am I supposed to do?

00:37:19.140 --> 00:37:19.810
JERMAINE FOWLER: It's a lot.

00:37:19.810 --> 00:37:21.040
But it's also a blessing
because, you know,

00:37:21.040 --> 00:37:23.050
a lot of opportunities
for comics are happening

00:37:23.050 --> 00:37:24.796
and people can finally--

00:37:24.796 --> 00:37:26.920
there isn't just Comedy--
when I was just starting,

00:37:26.920 --> 00:37:28.469
it was just Comedy Central.

00:37:28.469 --> 00:37:30.260
RELL BATTLE: I don't
think Netflix was out.

00:37:30.260 --> 00:37:30.340
HBO was--

00:37:30.340 --> 00:37:31.810
JERMAINE FOWLER: No, it
was just Comedy Central,

00:37:31.810 --> 00:37:33.460
and they were like
the gatekeepers.

00:37:33.460 --> 00:37:35.110
And now a lot of people
working at Comedy Central

00:37:35.110 --> 00:37:35.900
work at Netflix.

00:37:35.900 --> 00:37:38.310
So it's pretty cool
to watch that happen.

00:37:38.310 --> 00:37:39.910
RELL BATTLE: It does take the
power away from certain people.

00:37:39.910 --> 00:37:41.390
JERMAINE FOWLER: It does, and
I'm very happy about that.

00:37:41.390 --> 00:37:42.470
SPEAKER 2: So it
democratizes it.

00:37:42.470 --> 00:37:43.180
JERMAINE FOWLER: It really does.

00:37:43.180 --> 00:37:43.282
RELL BATTLE: You
guys don't know what

00:37:43.282 --> 00:37:44.390
it's like not to have power.

00:37:44.390 --> 00:37:45.890
But for everybody--
other networks,

00:37:45.890 --> 00:37:47.590
it takes the power away
from a Comedy Central.

00:37:47.590 --> 00:37:47.880
JERMAINE FOWLER: Yeah.

00:37:47.880 --> 00:37:49.600
Like Hulu, Seeso are
getting in on it,

00:37:49.600 --> 00:37:51.459
and it's pretty remarkable
to see all that.

00:37:51.459 --> 00:37:53.500
But the problem is now
there's a lot of specials,

00:37:53.500 --> 00:37:56.440
so it's your job to
find the ones you like.

00:37:56.440 --> 00:37:58.870
But all that takes is
going to live comedy shows

00:37:58.870 --> 00:37:59.760
and supporting.

00:37:59.760 --> 00:38:01.390
Seeing the person you like
and really just following

00:38:01.390 --> 00:38:01.931
their career.

00:38:04.986 --> 00:38:06.860
AUDIENCE: I used to work
with John Montgomery

00:38:06.860 --> 00:38:09.300
at Leo Burnett, when
he would carry around

00:38:09.300 --> 00:38:11.360
a suitcase full of
ideas for TV shows.

00:38:11.360 --> 00:38:14.360
And he was one of my
favorite people to work with.

00:38:14.360 --> 00:38:17.320
I'm just curious how you
guys like working with John.

00:38:17.320 --> 00:38:18.935
JERMAINE FOWLER: John's dope.

00:38:18.935 --> 00:38:21.018
MAZ JOBRANI: For the rest
of them that don't know,

00:38:21.018 --> 00:38:24.791
John Montgomery is one of our
exec producers as well as a--

00:38:24.791 --> 00:38:26.290
JERMAINE FOWLER:
Native Chicago guy.

00:38:26.290 --> 00:38:28.230
MAZ JOBRANI: Mark
Teitelbaum, these two guys.

00:38:28.230 --> 00:38:31.220
And, yeah, your
question, we love him.

00:38:31.220 --> 00:38:32.570
He's such a sweetheart.

00:38:32.570 --> 00:38:34.700
And these two were
the ones who found

00:38:34.700 --> 00:38:37.220
the project in the first
place from Tracy Letts, right?

00:38:37.220 --> 00:38:39.060
DAVID KOECHNER: John is a
friend of Tracy's, yeah.

00:38:39.060 --> 00:38:40.550
RELL BATTLE: John and Mark
Teitelbaum over there.

00:38:40.550 --> 00:38:42.841
John's the guy who looks like
Harold Ramis in the back.

00:38:42.841 --> 00:38:43.590
Right there.

00:38:43.590 --> 00:38:45.590
Mark's right there, sitting
alone with the black jacket.

00:38:45.590 --> 00:38:46.780
DAVID KOECHNER: So
we're grateful for John,

00:38:46.780 --> 00:38:49.204
because if not for him,
this show wouldn't exist.

00:38:49.204 --> 00:38:50.870
RELL BATTLE: And I'll
tell you how great

00:38:50.870 --> 00:38:52.349
it is working with John.

00:38:52.349 --> 00:38:54.890
I was dating a girl at the time,
and I bought her to the set,

00:38:54.890 --> 00:38:57.260
and she was so bored
during the taping.

00:38:57.260 --> 00:38:59.270
And John was like, you
know what you need?

00:38:59.270 --> 00:39:00.430
Some magic tricks.

00:39:00.430 --> 00:39:04.320
Breaks out the cards,
give it to her,

00:39:04.320 --> 00:39:06.930
she was happy for
the rest of the day.

00:39:06.930 --> 00:39:08.972
How could I not want
that as a producer?

00:39:08.972 --> 00:39:10.930
JERMAINE FOWLER: One of
the writers on the show

00:39:10.930 --> 00:39:13.470
is afraid of magic, and she's
afraid to tell John that.

00:39:13.470 --> 00:39:15.667
John, every time you
pull out your cards,

00:39:15.667 --> 00:39:17.750
she walks away because she
can't handle the magic.

00:39:20.110 --> 00:39:21.860
She goes, oh I can't
do it, I can't do it.

00:39:21.860 --> 00:39:23.609
RELL BATTLE: When you
bring a girl to set,

00:39:23.609 --> 00:39:24.660
take her over to John.

00:39:24.660 --> 00:39:27.050
JERMAINE FOWLER:
That was awesome.

00:39:27.050 --> 00:39:28.400
John's a good dude.

00:39:28.400 --> 00:39:30.392
He's a great tour
guide too, in Chicago.

00:39:30.392 --> 00:39:31.850
SPEAKER 2: So one
of the question's

00:39:31.850 --> 00:39:34.760
I was going to ask
earlier, you've mentioned,

00:39:34.760 --> 00:39:36.590
hey, get up there, fail
as much as you can.

00:39:36.590 --> 00:39:39.050
Oftentimes people talk about,
hey failure, have as many

00:39:39.050 --> 00:39:42.510
at bats, or swing it out
as many times as you can.

00:39:42.510 --> 00:39:44.300
But even though that's
true, most people

00:39:44.300 --> 00:39:45.900
avoid it like the plague.

00:39:45.900 --> 00:39:49.125
And so, the question is,
clearly with what all of you do,

00:39:49.125 --> 00:39:51.500
you're dealing with failure
right on all the time, right?

00:39:51.500 --> 00:39:53.083
People either like
you, or they don't.

00:39:53.083 --> 00:39:57.470
The question is, how
do you rebound, right?

00:39:57.470 --> 00:40:00.295
There has to have been times
when you didn't deal with it so

00:40:00.295 --> 00:40:01.760
easily or maybe you
deal with failure really

00:40:01.760 --> 00:40:03.560
well as a stand up
comedian, or as an actor,

00:40:03.560 --> 00:40:04.640
but you don't deal
with it so well

00:40:04.640 --> 00:40:06.110
in other areas of your life.

00:40:06.110 --> 00:40:08.956
So what have you done to be
successful to manage that?

00:40:08.956 --> 00:40:11.330
MAZ JOBRANI: That's why you've
got to find what you love,

00:40:11.330 --> 00:40:13.040
and that's why, again, I
think you guys are probably

00:40:13.040 --> 00:40:13.770
in the field--

00:40:13.770 --> 00:40:15.980
I hope you're in the
field-- that you love.

00:40:15.980 --> 00:40:19.460
All the stories you
hear about Bill Gates

00:40:19.460 --> 00:40:22.610
being in that garage for so
long, or any of these guys

00:40:22.610 --> 00:40:25.220
who founded these companies,
just going, and going,

00:40:25.220 --> 00:40:27.290
and going.

00:40:27.290 --> 00:40:29.660
I studied poli sci undergrad.

00:40:29.660 --> 00:40:31.440
I started a PhD
program in poli sci.

00:40:31.440 --> 00:40:32.810
I dropped out.

00:40:32.810 --> 00:40:38.280
Throughout my early 20s, I
tried my hand at different jobs.

00:40:38.280 --> 00:40:39.901
And I wasn't
passionate about them.

00:40:39.901 --> 00:40:41.900
So when I wouldn't do
well at them, I'd be like,

00:40:41.900 --> 00:40:42.483
you know what?

00:40:42.483 --> 00:40:43.370
I quit.

00:40:43.370 --> 00:40:50.210
But finally, when I found this,
even though it was a bad night,

00:40:50.210 --> 00:40:52.872
it wasn't a failure.

00:40:52.872 --> 00:40:54.830
It was like, OK, I'll
come back again tomorrow.

00:40:54.830 --> 00:40:56.163
Because I really was passionate.

00:40:56.163 --> 00:40:57.170
I really loved it.

00:40:57.170 --> 00:40:58.680
I had to do it the next day.

00:40:58.680 --> 00:41:01.010
As a matter of fact,
when I had a bad night,

00:41:01.010 --> 00:41:03.330
I couldn't wait to get
back up to almost get--

00:41:03.330 --> 00:41:04.830
it's like a baseball
player probably

00:41:04.830 --> 00:41:06.350
wants to get that hit again.

00:41:06.350 --> 00:41:08.809
I wanted to just get up, get
a hit, get a pretty good set,

00:41:08.809 --> 00:41:10.850
and be like, OK, I'm going
to put that behind me.

00:41:10.850 --> 00:41:12.980
So in the same way,
I think if you really

00:41:12.980 --> 00:41:15.590
can find your passion,
then your failures

00:41:15.590 --> 00:41:17.780
are just part of the road.

00:41:17.780 --> 00:41:20.590
Because you can't
succeed 100% of the time.

00:41:20.590 --> 00:41:22.677
And if you are,
you're delusional.

00:41:22.677 --> 00:41:25.010
RELL BATTLE: I think it's
also great to have friends who

00:41:25.010 --> 00:41:26.720
do the same thing that you do.

00:41:26.720 --> 00:41:30.717
Because I know, as
comedians, we fail together.

00:41:30.717 --> 00:41:32.300
I will come back
like, oh, man, I just

00:41:32.300 --> 00:41:33.650
bombed the Laugh Factory.

00:41:33.650 --> 00:41:35.180
And my boy will be like, I
bombed at the Comedy Store

00:41:35.180 --> 00:41:37.429
and I got in a fight with
one of the audience members.

00:41:37.429 --> 00:41:39.510
Like oof, your night was
way worse than my shit.

00:41:39.510 --> 00:41:42.510
It's like, all right.

00:41:42.510 --> 00:41:44.480
This is one thing
about the comedy clubs,

00:41:44.480 --> 00:41:47.780
you can always hear a
worse story that night.

00:41:47.780 --> 00:41:50.390
Somebody always had it worse.

00:41:50.390 --> 00:41:52.962
And I hate to say it, it
makes you feel better.

00:41:52.962 --> 00:41:54.920
One day, you're going to
have that worse story.

00:41:54.920 --> 00:41:57.045
But every night I went and
I was upset and bothered

00:41:57.045 --> 00:41:58.850
and frustrated, somebody
always was like,

00:41:58.850 --> 00:42:01.790
man, my money only
came-- half of the money.

00:42:01.790 --> 00:42:03.849
Well, I'm getting
evicted tomorrow, bro.

00:42:03.849 --> 00:42:05.390
So it's like, OK,
well you know what?

00:42:05.390 --> 00:42:06.030
I'm going to try tomorrow.

00:42:06.030 --> 00:42:07.070
We're going to be good.

00:42:07.070 --> 00:42:09.830
And you know, people's
pain makes me feel better.

00:42:09.830 --> 00:42:10.959
Is that the point?

00:42:10.959 --> 00:42:11.500
I don't know.

00:42:11.500 --> 00:42:15.080
DAVID KOECHNER: Plus, you
have success somewhere.

00:42:15.080 --> 00:42:17.120
People like to hear
failure stories,

00:42:17.120 --> 00:42:18.870
but there's a lot of success.

00:42:18.870 --> 00:42:20.450
And so you just build on that.

00:42:20.450 --> 00:42:22.640
I think a lot of it, too,
is you make your decision

00:42:22.640 --> 00:42:24.910
and that's it.

00:42:24.910 --> 00:42:28.167
That will go your way and you
just keep that in your heart,

00:42:28.167 --> 00:42:29.250
like I'm going to succeed.

00:42:29.250 --> 00:42:32.750
And then, hopefully, you're able
to see enough success that that

00:42:32.750 --> 00:42:34.900
helps you build to your dream.

00:42:34.900 --> 00:42:37.850
Because I've known people, too,
that hang in there for years,

00:42:37.850 --> 00:42:41.210
and you're just like, no
one has encouraged you once,

00:42:41.210 --> 00:42:43.730
and that's almost
more admirable.

00:42:43.730 --> 00:42:46.480
People that have no
success, yet stay in it.

00:42:46.480 --> 00:42:51.400
But ultimately, they'll
usually opt out.

00:42:51.400 --> 00:42:53.760
Yeah, I think you just,
you've got to believe.

00:42:53.760 --> 00:42:56.790
You make that decision
and you just go full head.

00:42:56.790 --> 00:42:59.400
RELL BATTLE: And once you
get there, it's so sweet.

00:42:59.400 --> 00:43:00.500
You guys, this is Google.

00:43:00.500 --> 00:43:03.840
Like, it doesn't get better
than this, I'm assuming, right?

00:43:03.840 --> 00:43:05.190
In the tech world.

00:43:05.190 --> 00:43:06.120
OK, maybe it does.

00:43:06.120 --> 00:43:06.240
Never mind.

00:43:06.240 --> 00:43:07.020
You guys are looking at me--

00:43:07.020 --> 00:43:09.478
DAVID KOECHNER: There's a lot
of free water, and free food.

00:43:09.478 --> 00:43:11.470
It's pretty good.

00:43:11.470 --> 00:43:13.412
JERMAINE FOWLER: I liked
that when I was broke

00:43:13.412 --> 00:43:15.120
living in Washington
Heights in New York,

00:43:15.120 --> 00:43:18.890
I was sleeping on his air
mattress and I was sad.

00:43:18.890 --> 00:43:23.190
But I read Steve Martin's bio.

00:43:23.190 --> 00:43:27.330
And that really
just opened my eyes

00:43:27.330 --> 00:43:30.510
a little bit about, oh,
the struggle is real.

00:43:30.510 --> 00:43:33.864
And Hannibal's "What the Fuck"
episode, Mark Maron's podcast.

00:43:33.864 --> 00:43:35.530
RELL BATTLE: Yeah,
that was pretty good.

00:43:35.530 --> 00:43:37.363
JERMAINE FOWLER: When
he slept on the train,

00:43:37.363 --> 00:43:39.220
I was like, me too.

00:43:39.220 --> 00:43:41.710
When you hear similar stories,
like Rell was talking about,

00:43:41.710 --> 00:43:44.970
it really does help you
realize, oh, hey, I'm

00:43:44.970 --> 00:43:47.205
not the only one
going through this.

00:43:47.205 --> 00:43:50.509
I think Amy Poehler has a
dope book about her first

00:43:50.509 --> 00:43:51.300
moving to New York.

00:43:54.210 --> 00:43:56.326
Part of success is failure.

00:43:56.326 --> 00:43:58.950
Probably you get most of failure
before you get to the success,

00:43:58.950 --> 00:44:00.420
you know?

00:44:00.420 --> 00:44:04.322
But once you get there, like
Rell said, it's really sweet.

00:44:04.322 --> 00:44:05.280
It's a beautiful thing.

00:44:05.280 --> 00:44:09.520
And for the most part,
now that I'm here,

00:44:09.520 --> 00:44:14.060
I appreciate me failing so much
because those were the best

00:44:14.060 --> 00:44:15.150
stories.

00:44:15.150 --> 00:44:18.300
I go back home to Brooklyn and
I talk to my old comedy buddies,

00:44:18.300 --> 00:44:20.910
and I talk to them
about times that we

00:44:20.910 --> 00:44:23.850
used to get wasted and
annoy people so much

00:44:23.850 --> 00:44:25.590
they would fight each other.

00:44:25.590 --> 00:44:28.530
We didn't know how we
did it, but we were just

00:44:28.530 --> 00:44:29.520
mean comics, man.

00:44:29.520 --> 00:44:31.395
We were just going
through a lot at the time.

00:44:31.395 --> 00:44:33.150
And it was just great.

00:44:33.150 --> 00:44:34.906
But having similar
stories is very helpful

00:44:34.906 --> 00:44:36.780
when you're going through
that type of stuff.

00:44:36.780 --> 00:44:37.300
SPEAKER 2: That's awesome.

00:44:37.300 --> 00:44:38.910
By the way, a late
congratulations

00:44:38.910 --> 00:44:40.285
to having a beautiful baby girl.

00:44:40.285 --> 00:44:41.660
JERMAINE FOWLER:
Thank you, Lila.

00:44:41.660 --> 00:44:42.410
I appreciate that.

00:44:42.410 --> 00:44:43.580
[APPLAUSE]

00:44:43.580 --> 00:44:45.501
RELL BATTLE: She's gorgeous.

00:44:45.501 --> 00:44:46.500
She looks just like him.

00:44:46.500 --> 00:44:46.950
JERMAINE FOWLER: It's weird.

00:44:46.950 --> 00:44:48.325
My little daughter
looks like me,

00:44:48.325 --> 00:44:50.280
so that's unfortunate for her.

00:44:50.280 --> 00:44:52.710
But she's so cool.

00:44:52.710 --> 00:44:53.627
She's getting taller.

00:44:53.627 --> 00:44:55.460
I think she might be
taller than me when she

00:44:55.460 --> 00:44:58.169
gets older, which is awesome.

00:44:58.169 --> 00:45:00.210
People always ask me,
what's it like to be a dad?

00:45:00.210 --> 00:45:02.310
I don't have a word for it.

00:45:02.310 --> 00:45:03.570
It's awesome.

00:45:03.570 --> 00:45:06.144
It's beautiful and
she's like, I can't

00:45:06.144 --> 00:45:08.060
wait to go back home to
see her tomorrow, man.

00:45:08.060 --> 00:45:09.018
It's going to be great.

00:45:09.018 --> 00:45:12.250
We're going to dress her up
as Chuckie for Halloween.

00:45:12.250 --> 00:45:15.285
She's the right size
for the costume.

00:45:15.285 --> 00:45:17.910
SPEAKER 2: Are there any other--
yeah, we got another question.

00:45:17.910 --> 00:45:21.160
AUDIENCE: So Chicago plays a big
role in your show, obviously.

00:45:21.160 --> 00:45:24.060
And some of you have spent
a lot of time in Chicago.

00:45:24.060 --> 00:45:27.240
Is there anything
that you're super

00:45:27.240 --> 00:45:30.075
excited to do while you're
here or see, or just--

00:45:30.075 --> 00:45:31.950
RELL BATTLE: We want to
go to Millennial Park

00:45:31.950 --> 00:45:33.460
and do social media pictures.

00:45:33.460 --> 00:45:35.332
Isn't that right, Shauna?

00:45:35.332 --> 00:45:37.290
DAVID KOECHNER: Hopefully
it's going to be dark

00:45:37.290 --> 00:45:38.130
when we get out of here.

00:45:38.130 --> 00:45:39.360
JERMAINE FOWLER: Might be
a little too dark to do it.

00:45:39.360 --> 00:45:40.700
RELL BATTLE: But it'll be so
exciting to take social media

00:45:40.700 --> 00:45:42.572
pictures at Millennial Park.

00:45:42.572 --> 00:45:44.280
DAVID KOECHNER: We
haven't had much time.

00:45:44.280 --> 00:45:45.990
We got it last night
and we're all pretty

00:45:45.990 --> 00:45:48.510
exhausted because we've
been traveling every day.

00:45:48.510 --> 00:45:50.880
And today, we had
to get up at 4:45

00:45:50.880 --> 00:45:54.420
to leave the hotel at 5:15.

00:45:54.420 --> 00:45:56.530
We did get some
Giordano's pizza today.

00:45:56.530 --> 00:45:59.820
JERMAINE FOWLER: We got
Gio's and we feel like shit.

00:45:59.820 --> 00:46:01.220
DAVID KOECHNER: We got that in.

00:46:01.220 --> 00:46:01.860
JERMAINE FOWLER:
It was a mistake.

00:46:01.860 --> 00:46:03.900
I want to actually
go to Wiener's Circle

00:46:03.900 --> 00:46:05.540
with Dave Koechner.

00:46:05.540 --> 00:46:08.590
DAVID KOECHNER:
I'm not a big fan.

00:46:08.590 --> 00:46:09.990
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:46:12.027 --> 00:46:13.610
MAZ JOBRANI: Oh yeah,
I've been there.

00:46:13.610 --> 00:46:14.360
It's pretty funny.

00:46:14.360 --> 00:46:16.877
RELL BATTLE: I have
never been there.

00:46:16.877 --> 00:46:18.460
DAVID KOECHNER: If
we had another day,

00:46:18.460 --> 00:46:19.650
we would be able to--

00:46:19.650 --> 00:46:20.580
JERMAINE FOWLER: It's all good.

00:46:20.580 --> 00:46:21.163
It's all good.

00:46:21.163 --> 00:46:23.745
But I don't know.

00:46:23.745 --> 00:46:25.620
I actually wanted to do
a "Dark Knight" tour.

00:46:25.620 --> 00:46:26.780
Because I'm a big ass nerd.

00:46:26.780 --> 00:46:28.710
So I want to try and
do that actually.

00:46:28.710 --> 00:46:31.500
We went to the underpass
where the Joker drives.

00:46:31.500 --> 00:46:33.890
MAZ JOBRANI: Jermaine is
actually looking for Batman.

00:46:33.890 --> 00:46:35.070
He won't believe us.

00:46:35.070 --> 00:46:36.350
We're like, he's not real.

00:46:36.350 --> 00:46:38.276
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:38.276 --> 00:46:39.650
JERMAINE FOWLER:
I'm like, he is.

00:46:42.240 --> 00:46:43.040
I'm a huge nerd.

00:46:43.040 --> 00:46:44.540
I want to try and
do that, actually,

00:46:44.540 --> 00:46:46.720
so I'm going to go on Google
and find the landmarks.

00:46:46.720 --> 00:46:48.970
DAVID KOECHNER: We did a
segment at Second City today,

00:46:48.970 --> 00:46:49.820
so that was fun.

00:46:49.820 --> 00:46:52.110
Some of these guys
hadn't been there before.

00:46:52.110 --> 00:46:53.770
JERMAINE FOWLER: I did the
Rock Tour in San Francisco.

00:46:53.770 --> 00:46:54.550
You ever do that?

00:46:54.550 --> 00:46:55.515
DAVID KOECHNER: You mean--

00:46:55.515 --> 00:46:56.610
JERMAINE FOWLER: Sean
Connery and Nicholas Cage.

00:46:56.610 --> 00:46:57.040
DAVID KOECHNER: Oh, no.

00:46:57.040 --> 00:46:58.500
I didn't know there was one.

00:46:58.500 --> 00:46:59.750
JERMAINE FOWLER: There wasn't.

00:46:59.750 --> 00:47:01.877
I just Googled the places.

00:47:01.877 --> 00:47:03.460
DAVID KOECHNER: I'm
going to Alcatraz.

00:47:03.460 --> 00:47:05.190
JERMAINE FOWLER: I've never
been to Alcatraz, man.

00:47:05.190 --> 00:47:06.520
DAVID KOECHNER: Should have
been first on the Rock Tour.

00:47:06.520 --> 00:47:07.895
JERMAINE FOWLER:
Well, it wasn't.

00:47:07.895 --> 00:47:09.620
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:09.620 --> 00:47:11.140
It was a huge line to do it.

00:47:11.140 --> 00:47:13.195
I didn't have time.

00:47:13.195 --> 00:47:14.695
SPEAKER 2: We have
another question.

00:47:14.695 --> 00:47:16.800
AUDIENCE: Yeah, just one more.

00:47:16.800 --> 00:47:19.770
What were your favorite sitcoms
either growing up, or just

00:47:19.770 --> 00:47:21.770
of all time?

00:47:21.770 --> 00:47:24.397
MAZ JOBRANI: Mine was
"Cheers" and "Taxi".

00:47:24.397 --> 00:47:25.605
DAVID KOECHNER: Yeah, "Taxi."

00:47:29.420 --> 00:47:33.560
I liked Abbot and Costello's
movies and Monty Python.

00:47:33.560 --> 00:47:36.152
SNL was big.

00:47:36.152 --> 00:47:36.735
Marx brothers.

00:47:39.700 --> 00:47:40.200
I'm done.

00:47:40.200 --> 00:47:41.040
RELL BATTLE: As far
as sitcoms, I mean,

00:47:41.040 --> 00:47:42.450
I'm from DC, as
well as Jermaine.

00:47:42.450 --> 00:47:44.860
So "Martin" was the world.

00:47:44.860 --> 00:47:45.960
"Martin" was everything.

00:47:45.960 --> 00:47:47.918
I didn't care about
nothing else, but "Martin."

00:47:47.918 --> 00:47:49.290
JERMAINE FOWLER: "Martin."

00:47:49.290 --> 00:47:50.581
RELL BATTLE: My early moments--

00:47:50.581 --> 00:47:53.070
I never told Katey this, but
I had the biggest crush on her

00:47:53.070 --> 00:47:54.760
because "Married With
Children" was the show.

00:47:54.760 --> 00:47:56.100
JERMAINE FOWLER: I think
we still do, actually.

00:47:56.100 --> 00:47:57.641
RELL BATTLE: "Married
with Children,"

00:47:57.641 --> 00:47:59.040
my dad and I used to watch that.

00:47:59.040 --> 00:48:00.600
"All In The Family"
was really great.

00:48:00.600 --> 00:48:01.475
I think it's similar.

00:48:01.475 --> 00:48:04.719
A lot of issues that
we talk about now.

00:48:04.719 --> 00:48:06.260
I've never seen
"Seinfeld" because it

00:48:06.260 --> 00:48:08.119
was on at the same
time as "Martin."

00:48:08.119 --> 00:48:09.660
And as a comedian,
that's like a sin.

00:48:09.660 --> 00:48:11.201
I'm like, I don't
know what happened.

00:48:11.201 --> 00:48:12.360
Who's Kramer?

00:48:12.360 --> 00:48:13.880
But I know who Sheneneh was.

00:48:13.880 --> 00:48:15.434
SPEAKER 2: Sheneneh.

00:48:15.434 --> 00:48:16.350
Was Sheneneh "Martin"?

00:48:16.350 --> 00:48:17.350
JERMAINE FOWLER: Does
"Ren and Stimpy" count?

00:48:17.350 --> 00:48:18.235
I used to watch
that all the time.

00:48:18.235 --> 00:48:18.985
RELL BATTLE: Yeah.

00:48:18.985 --> 00:48:20.670
SPEAKER 2: I thought that was--

00:48:20.670 --> 00:48:22.270
RELL BATTLE: Martin
played Sheneneh.

00:48:22.270 --> 00:48:23.144
You didn't know that?

00:48:23.144 --> 00:48:24.150
This interview's over.

00:48:24.150 --> 00:48:25.480
JERMAINE FOWLER: You didn't
know Martin played that hideous

00:48:25.480 --> 00:48:26.186
woman?

00:48:26.186 --> 00:48:26.943
SPEAKER 2: No.

00:48:26.943 --> 00:48:27.580
JERMAINE FOWLER:
That was Martin.

00:48:27.580 --> 00:48:29.160
RELL BATTLE: Wow, we got to do
a lot of work after this show.

00:48:29.160 --> 00:48:29.980
We got to talk.

00:48:29.980 --> 00:48:32.522
DAVID KOECHNER: I'd say "Mash,"
too, was big for me as a kid.

00:48:32.522 --> 00:48:34.771
JERMAINE FOWLER: "Mash" came
on at 4:00 in the morning

00:48:34.771 --> 00:48:36.890
when I was a kid, so
I couldn't watch it.

00:48:36.890 --> 00:48:38.720
It always came on really,
really early for some reason.

00:48:38.720 --> 00:48:39.535
The reruns for some reason.

00:48:39.535 --> 00:48:41.950
RELL BATTLE: He played
Sheneneh, Otus, Dragonfly Jones.

00:48:41.950 --> 00:48:43.241
SPEAKER 2: I did not know that.

00:48:43.241 --> 00:48:45.772
RELL BATTLE: I'm giving
you a class on "Martin."

00:48:45.772 --> 00:48:47.480
SPEAKER 2: Must have
been before my time.

00:48:47.480 --> 00:48:49.886
Anyway, any other-- or not.

00:48:49.886 --> 00:48:53.220
And other questions
from the audience?

00:48:53.220 --> 00:48:56.525
RELL BATTLE: They're ready to go
back and make flying cars now.

00:48:56.525 --> 00:48:57.900
SPEAKER 2: Well,
I will say this,

00:48:57.900 --> 00:49:00.210
considering the fact that
you all were up at 4:45

00:49:00.210 --> 00:49:04.830
or whatever, we are extremely
grateful that you even passed

00:49:04.830 --> 00:49:06.947
by and stopped by to say
hello to us and chat.

00:49:06.947 --> 00:49:08.280
You guys are clearly very funny.

00:49:08.280 --> 00:49:10.190
I haven't laughed this
much this whole week.

00:49:10.190 --> 00:49:11.980
Of course, it just started.

00:49:11.980 --> 00:49:13.530
So thanks again.

00:49:13.530 --> 00:49:15.250
And good luck with the show.

00:49:15.250 --> 00:49:16.720
I know I'm going to tune in.

00:49:16.720 --> 00:49:17.130
MAZ JOBRANI: Thank you.

00:49:17.130 --> 00:49:17.880
Thank you, guys.

00:49:17.880 --> 00:49:18.706
JERMAINE FOWLER:
Thank you, guys.

00:49:18.706 --> 00:49:19.665
[APPLAUSE]

00:49:19.665 --> 00:49:21.860
Are they engineers or marketers?

00:49:21.860 --> 00:49:24.800
Who are we talking to?
