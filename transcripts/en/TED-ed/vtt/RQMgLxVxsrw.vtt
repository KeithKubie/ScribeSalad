00:00:13.629 --> 00:00:16.284
Today, we're going to look at the world of Rome

00:00:16.284 --> 00:00:18.334
through the eyes of a young girl.

00:00:18.334 --> 00:00:20.920
Here she is, drawing a picture of herself

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:24.505
in the atrium of her father's enormous house.

00:00:24.505 --> 00:00:26.421
Her name is Domitia,

00:00:26.421 --> 00:00:29.051
and she is just 5 years old.

00:00:29.051 --> 00:00:31.405
She has an older brother who is fourteen,

00:00:31.405 --> 00:00:34.598
Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus,

00:00:34.598 --> 00:00:36.487
named after her dad.

00:00:36.487 --> 00:00:39.738
Girls don't get these long names that boys have.

00:00:39.738 --> 00:00:41.856
What is worse is that Dad insists

00:00:41.856 --> 00:00:44.702
on calling all his daughters Domitia.

00:00:44.702 --> 00:00:45.513
"Domitia!"

00:00:45.513 --> 00:00:47.783
His call to Domitia drawing on the column,

00:00:47.783 --> 00:00:49.232
Domitia III.

00:00:49.232 --> 00:00:53.119
She has an older sister, Domitia II, who is 7 years old.

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:56.038
And then there's Domitia I, who is ten.

00:00:56.038 --> 00:00:58.154
There would have been a Domitia IV,

00:00:58.154 --> 00:01:01.893
but mom died trying to give birth to her three years ago.

00:01:01.893 --> 00:01:03.227
Confused?

00:01:03.227 --> 00:01:04.918
The Romans were too.

00:01:04.918 --> 00:01:07.591
They could work out ancestry through the male line

00:01:07.591 --> 00:01:09.652
with the nice, tripartite names

00:01:09.652 --> 00:01:13.225
such as Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus.

00:01:13.225 --> 00:01:14.468
But they got in a real mess

00:01:14.468 --> 00:01:16.934
over which Domitia was married to whom

00:01:16.934 --> 00:01:18.769
and was either the great aunt

00:01:18.769 --> 00:01:22.148
or the great stepmother and so on to whom

00:01:22.148 --> 00:01:24.146
when they came to write it down.

00:01:24.146 --> 00:01:27.155
Domitia III is not just drawing on the pillar,

00:01:27.155 --> 00:01:29.488
she's also watching the action.

00:01:29.488 --> 00:01:30.655
You see, it's early,

00:01:30.655 --> 00:01:34.076
in the time of day when all her dad's clients and friends

00:01:34.076 --> 00:01:37.454
come to see him at home to pay their respects.

00:01:37.454 --> 00:01:40.791
Lucius Popidius Secundus, a 17 year old,

00:01:40.791 --> 00:01:42.667
he wants to marry Domitia II

00:01:42.667 --> 00:01:44.709
within the next five to seven years,

00:01:44.709 --> 00:01:46.004
has come as well.

00:01:46.004 --> 00:01:48.736
He seems to be wooing not his future wife,

00:01:48.736 --> 00:01:50.158
but her dad.

00:01:50.158 --> 00:01:53.242
Poor Lucius, he does not know that Domitia's dad

00:01:53.242 --> 00:01:55.158
thinks he and his family are wealthy

00:01:55.158 --> 00:01:58.134
but still scumbags from the Subura.

00:01:58.134 --> 00:02:00.074
Afterall, it is the part of Rome

00:02:00.074 --> 00:02:03.466
full of barbers and prostitutes.

00:02:03.466 --> 00:02:06.027
Suddenly, all the men are leaving with Dad.

00:02:06.027 --> 00:02:07.149
It's the second hour

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:09.320
and time for him to be in court

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:11.252
with a sturdy audience of clients

00:02:11.252 --> 00:02:12.906
to applaud his rhetoric

00:02:12.906 --> 00:02:15.407
and hiss at his opponent.

00:02:15.407 --> 00:02:17.199
The house is now quieter.

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:19.469
The men won't return for seven hours,

00:02:19.469 --> 00:02:21.124
not until dinner time.

00:02:21.124 --> 00:02:25.085
But what happens in the house for those seven hours?

00:02:25.085 --> 00:02:29.562
What do Domitia, Domitia, and Domitia do all day?

00:02:29.562 --> 00:02:31.302
Not an easy question!

00:02:31.302 --> 00:02:33.494
Everything written down by the Romans

00:02:33.494 --> 00:02:36.180
that we have today was written by men.

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.913
This makes constructing the lives of women difficult.

00:02:39.913 --> 00:02:44.008
However, we can't have a history of just Roman men,

00:02:44.008 --> 00:02:45.600
so here it goes.

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.774
We can begin in the atrium.

00:02:47.774 --> 00:02:48.746
There is a massive loom,

00:02:48.746 --> 00:02:52.686
on which Dad's latest wife is working on a new toga.

00:02:52.686 --> 00:02:55.326
Domitia, Domitia, and Domitia are tasked

00:02:55.326 --> 00:02:56.525
with spinning the wool

00:02:56.525 --> 00:02:59.834
that will be used to weave this mighty garment,

00:02:59.834 --> 00:03:03.749
30 or more feet long and elliptical in shape.

00:03:03.749 --> 00:03:05.108
Romans loved the idea

00:03:05.108 --> 00:03:07.329
that their wives work wool.

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:08.739
We know that because it's written

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:12.099
on the gravestones of so many Roman women.

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:14.003
Unlike women in Greece,

00:03:14.003 --> 00:03:15.801
Roman women go out the house

00:03:15.801 --> 00:03:17.721
and move about the city.

00:03:17.721 --> 00:03:20.849
They go to the baths in the morning to avoid the men

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:24.383
or to separate baths that are for women only.

00:03:24.383 --> 00:03:28.272
Some do go in for the latest fad of the AD 70s:

00:03:28.272 --> 00:03:32.312
nude bathing with men present.

00:03:32.312 --> 00:03:33.867
Where they have no place

00:03:33.867 --> 00:03:35.176
is where the men are:

00:03:35.176 --> 00:03:36.166
in the Forum,

00:03:36.166 --> 00:03:37.168
in the Law Court,

00:03:37.168 --> 00:03:39.106
or in the Senate House.

00:03:39.122 --> 00:03:42.079
Their place in public is in the porticos

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:43.120
with gardens,

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:44.295
with sculpture,

00:03:44.295 --> 00:03:47.337
and with pathways for walking in.

00:03:47.337 --> 00:03:49.718
When Domitia, Domitia, and Domitia want

00:03:49.718 --> 00:03:51.474
to leave the house to go somewhere,

00:03:51.474 --> 00:03:53.670
like the Portico of Livia,

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:55.145
they must get ready.

00:03:55.145 --> 00:03:58.211
Domitia II and Domitia III are ready,

00:03:58.211 --> 00:04:01.064
but Domitia I, who is betrothed to be married

00:04:01.064 --> 00:04:03.945
in two years to darling Philatus,

00:04:03.945 --> 00:04:05.154
isn't ready.

00:04:05.154 --> 00:04:08.346
She's not slow, she just has more to do.

00:04:08.346 --> 00:04:12.784
Being betrothed means she wears the insignia of betrothal:

00:04:12.784 --> 00:04:14.092
engagement rings

00:04:14.092 --> 00:04:16.926
and all the gifts Pilatus has given her -

00:04:16.926 --> 00:04:17.791
jewels,

00:04:17.791 --> 00:04:18.628
earrings,

00:04:18.628 --> 00:04:19.709
necklaces,

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:21.294
and the pendants.

00:04:21.294 --> 00:04:23.659
She may even wear her myrtle crown.

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:25.041
All this bling shouts,

00:04:25.041 --> 00:04:27.617
"I'm getting married to that 19 year old

00:04:27.617 --> 00:04:30.178
who gave me all this stuff I'm wearing!"

00:04:30.178 --> 00:04:34.060
While as they wait, Domitia II and Domitia III play with their dolls

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:36.102
that mirror the image of their sister

00:04:36.102 --> 00:04:38.036
decked out to be married.

00:04:38.036 --> 00:04:40.103
One day, these dolls will be dedicated

00:04:40.103 --> 00:04:43.777
to the household gods on the day of their wedding.

00:04:43.777 --> 00:04:45.189
Okay, we're ready.

00:04:45.189 --> 00:04:49.028
The girls step into litters carried by some burly slaves.

00:04:49.028 --> 00:04:51.097
They also have a chaperone with them

00:04:51.097 --> 00:04:54.785
and will be meeting an aunt at the Porticus of Livia.

00:04:54.785 --> 00:04:57.323
Carried high on the shoulders of these slaves,

00:04:57.323 --> 00:04:59.540
the girls look out through the curtains

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:02.042
to see the crowded streets below them.

00:05:02.042 --> 00:05:04.494
They traverse the city, pass the Coliseum,

00:05:04.494 --> 00:05:07.046
but then turn off to climb up the hill

00:05:07.046 --> 00:05:09.432
to the Porticus of Livia.

00:05:09.432 --> 00:05:13.768
It was built by Livia, the wife of the first emperor Augustus,

00:05:13.768 --> 00:05:16.972
on the site of the house of Vedius Pollio.

00:05:16.972 --> 00:05:18.775
He wasn't such a great guy.

00:05:18.775 --> 00:05:20.406
He once tried to feed a slave

00:05:20.406 --> 00:05:22.451
to the eels in his fish pond

00:05:22.451 --> 00:05:24.525
for simply dropping a dish.

00:05:24.525 --> 00:05:26.859
Luckily, the emperor was at the dinner

00:05:26.859 --> 00:05:29.114
and tamed his temper.

00:05:29.114 --> 00:05:31.198
The litters are placed on the ground

00:05:31.198 --> 00:05:32.623
and the girls get out

00:05:32.623 --> 00:05:34.997
and arm in arm, two by two,

00:05:34.997 --> 00:05:36.293
they ascend the steps

00:05:36.293 --> 00:05:39.623
into the enclosed garden with many columns.

00:05:39.623 --> 00:05:43.618
Domitia III shot off and is drawing on a column.

00:05:43.618 --> 00:05:45.585
Domitia II joins her

00:05:45.585 --> 00:05:49.603
but seeks to read the graffiti higher up on the column.

00:05:49.603 --> 00:05:52.535
She spots a drawing of gladiators

00:05:52.535 --> 00:05:54.928
and tries to imagine seeing them fighting,

00:05:54.928 --> 00:05:56.936
something she will never be permitted to do,

00:05:56.936 --> 00:06:00.463
except from the very rear of the Coliseum.

00:06:00.463 --> 00:06:02.698
From there, she will have a good view

00:06:02.698 --> 00:06:05.026
of the 50,000 spectators

00:06:05.026 --> 00:06:09.184
but will see little by way of blood and gore.

00:06:09.184 --> 00:06:11.154
If she really wanted a decent view,

00:06:11.154 --> 00:06:12.905
she could become a vestal virgin

00:06:12.905 --> 00:06:15.224
and would sit right down the front.

00:06:15.224 --> 00:06:18.333
But a career tending the sacred flame of Vesta

00:06:18.333 --> 00:06:21.355
is not to everybody's taste.

00:06:21.355 --> 00:06:23.915
Domitia I has met another ten year old

00:06:23.915 --> 00:06:28.381
also decked out in the insignia of betrothal.

00:06:28.381 --> 00:06:29.508
Home time.

00:06:29.508 --> 00:06:31.565
When they get there after the eighth hour,

00:06:31.565 --> 00:06:33.319
something is up.

00:06:33.319 --> 00:06:36.603
A smashed dish lies on the floor.

00:06:36.603 --> 00:06:39.472
All the slaves are being gathered together in the atrium

00:06:39.472 --> 00:06:42.534
and await the arrival of their master.

00:06:42.534 --> 00:06:45.438
Dad is going to go mad.

00:06:45.438 --> 00:06:46.930
He will not hit his children,

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:48.484
but like many other Romans,

00:06:48.484 --> 00:06:52.153
he believes that slaves have to be punished.

00:06:52.153 --> 00:06:54.446
The whip lies ready for his arrival.

00:06:54.446 --> 00:06:56.680
No one knows who smashed the dish,

00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:58.575
but Dad will call the undertaker

00:06:58.575 --> 00:07:02.100
to torture it out of them, if he must.

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:05.756
The doorkeeper opens the front door to the house.

00:07:05.756 --> 00:07:08.518
A hush comes over the anxious slaves.

00:07:08.518 --> 00:07:10.391
In walks not their master

00:07:10.391 --> 00:07:12.847
but, instead, a pregnant teenager.

00:07:12.847 --> 00:07:16.254
It is the master's eldest daughter, age 15,

00:07:16.254 --> 00:07:19.612
who is already a veteran of marriage and child birth.

00:07:19.612 --> 00:07:21.350
Guess what her name is.

00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:23.915
There is a five to ten percent chance

00:07:23.915 --> 00:07:26.520
she won't survive giving birth to her child,

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:29.932
but, for now, she has come to dinner with her family.

00:07:29.932 --> 00:07:31.403
As a teenage mother,

00:07:31.403 --> 00:07:34.320
she has proved that she is a successful wife

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:36.936
by bringing children and descendants for her husband,

00:07:36.936 --> 00:07:39.991
who will carry on his name in the future.

00:07:39.991 --> 00:07:42.199
The family head off to the dining room

00:07:42.199 --> 00:07:43.893
and are served dinner.

00:07:43.893 --> 00:07:47.972
It would seem Dad has had an invite to dinner elsewhere.

00:07:47.972 --> 00:07:50.873
With dinner concluded, the girls crossed the atrium

00:07:50.873 --> 00:07:53.214
to bid farewell to their older sister

00:07:53.214 --> 00:07:55.168
who is carried home in a litter,

00:07:55.168 --> 00:07:58.121
escorted by some of Dad's bodyguards.

00:07:58.121 --> 00:07:59.548
Returning to the house,

00:07:59.548 --> 00:08:01.634
the girls cross the atrium.

00:08:01.634 --> 00:08:03.094
The slaves, young and old,

00:08:03.094 --> 00:08:04.174
male and female,

00:08:04.174 --> 00:08:06.639
await the return of their owner.

00:08:06.639 --> 00:08:09.368
When he returns, he may exact vengeance,

00:08:09.368 --> 00:08:11.784
ensuring his power over the slaves

00:08:11.784 --> 00:08:14.813
is maintained through violence and terror,

00:08:14.813 --> 00:08:17.967
to which any slave could be subjected.

00:08:17.967 --> 00:08:20.552
But, for the girls, they head upstairs for the night,

00:08:20.552 --> 00:08:22.382
ready for bed.
