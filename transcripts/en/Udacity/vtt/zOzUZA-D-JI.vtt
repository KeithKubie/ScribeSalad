00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:05.621
I'll show you a nifty photot that needs math function to work. We want to take

00:00:05.621 --> 00:00:11.282
any old photo and make it appear as if it happened at sunset. And the idea is

00:00:11.282 --> 00:00:15.840
simple. We'll just add some extra red, like this. But there's a potential

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:22.346
problem. What if red is already 255 or close to it. Then if we ad 25 to it,

00:00:22.346 --> 00:00:28.972
then we'll get a value that's larger than 255 and that won't work. So I want

00:00:28.972 --> 00:00:35.764
red to be red plus 25 but at most 255. And one of the math functions that we've

00:00:35.764 --> 00:00:39.710
just seen will solve this for you. I'll even give you a hint. It's either

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:45.612
Math.max or Max.min. So go ahead and implement the redden method in the color

00:00:45.612 --> 00:00:48.470
class and then try out the effect.
