00:00:00.456 --> 00:00:02.393
Voiceover: Let's say that you have a hunch that

00:00:02.393 --> 00:00:06.977
sugar is somehow causing heart disease.

00:00:06.977 --> 00:00:10.159
Is somehow causing heart disease.

00:00:10.159 --> 00:00:11.840
So you want to research this further.

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:14.531
You want to see what kind of statistical studies

00:00:14.531 --> 00:00:17.937
can you perform to better understand sugar intake in

00:00:17.937 --> 00:00:21.120
the population generally and whether that seems

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:24.405
to be causing heart disease in some way.

00:00:24.405 --> 00:00:26.312
Well, the first that you might want to do is just to try

00:00:26.312 --> 00:00:30.414
to get a sense of sugar intake in the population as a whole.

00:00:30.414 --> 00:00:33.060
Now clearly, you don't know know, there's no way

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:36.889
of measuring exactly how much sugar every member, let's say

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:38.440
you're talking about the United States, every member

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:42.579
of that 300 million population is consuming everyday.

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:45.188
The way that we try to get a sense of how much sugar

00:00:45.188 --> 00:00:48.995
is being consumed is by conducting a sample study.

00:00:48.995 --> 00:00:53.566
So you take your population, your 300 million people.

00:00:53.566 --> 00:00:57.844
So you take your population right over here.

00:00:57.844 --> 00:00:59.832
Population.

00:00:59.832 --> 00:01:01.826
And you sample it.

00:01:01.826 --> 00:01:04.849
You sample your population and not only

00:01:04.849 --> 00:01:06.678
do you sample it, but you randomly sample it.

00:01:06.678 --> 00:01:09.825
Obviously you don't want to just survey people who are

00:01:09.825 --> 00:01:13.229
exiting a cupcake store or people who are exiting a gym.

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.335
You want it to be a random sample of people,

00:01:16.335 --> 00:01:20.218
where where you're sampling them shouldn't somehow

00:01:20.218 --> 00:01:23.294
affect whether or not their answer or how much sugar

00:01:23.294 --> 00:01:25.673
they might say that they are consuming.

00:01:25.673 --> 00:01:27.441
But they are gonna tell you how much sugar

00:01:27.441 --> 00:01:30.067
they consume, let's say, on an average day maybe

00:01:30.067 --> 00:01:32.880
by filling out a survey or through some other way.

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.303
And through that you would take this data and obviously,

00:01:36.303 --> 00:01:38.266
the more samples you have the better and we talk

00:01:38.266 --> 00:01:40.345
about that in depth in other statistics videos.

00:01:40.345 --> 00:01:44.913
About how you get a better predictor of the actual true

00:01:44.913 --> 00:01:48.922
population parameter, the more samples that you might take.

00:01:48.922 --> 00:01:52.345
But you might do that to get a gauge of how much sugar

00:01:52.345 --> 00:01:55.847
the average American consumes in a given day.

00:01:55.847 --> 00:01:59.276
So this right over here where you are taking random samples

00:01:59.276 --> 00:02:03.129
of the population to, essentially, generate a statistic

00:02:03.129 --> 00:02:07.389
that is estimating a true parameter, which is the actual

00:02:07.389 --> 00:02:11.181
amount of sugar Americans are consuming each day.

00:02:11.181 --> 00:02:13.396
We call this a sample study.

00:02:14.027 --> 00:02:17.338
Sample study.

00:02:17.338 --> 00:02:19.746
It's a way, once again, of just estimating what the

00:02:19.746 --> 00:02:23.407
actual amount of sugar people are having each day.

00:02:23.407 --> 00:02:24.806
Let's say you want to go further.

00:02:24.806 --> 00:02:27.952
This will give you a sense of what is likely the amount

00:02:27.952 --> 00:02:30.702
of sugar that people are consuming each day, but you

00:02:30.702 --> 00:02:33.726
really want to see how that's related to heart disease.

00:02:33.726 --> 00:02:37.501
So instead, what you do is you go survey people.

00:02:37.501 --> 00:02:43.499
You go survey people and you say, "How much sugar have

00:02:43.499 --> 00:02:46.703
"you consumed over", and once again, when you pick

00:02:46.703 --> 00:02:49.706
these people, you should be doing it randomly.

00:02:49.706 --> 00:02:54.477
So let's say you go survey a random sample of 60 year olds.

00:02:54.477 --> 00:02:56.530
So once again, you wouldn't want to sample people

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:58.832
who are in the hospital, you wouldn't want to

00:02:58.832 --> 00:03:03.066
sample people who are at or just at the gym.

00:03:03.066 --> 00:03:04.702
You would want to find a random sample

00:03:04.702 --> 00:03:06.796
or sample them in places where it shouldn't

00:03:06.796 --> 00:03:09.289
affect their answer, which way they are going to go.

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:14.644
Let's say you surveyed 300 60 year olds and you asked them

00:03:14.644 --> 00:03:18.594
how much sugar have they consumed over the last 30 years.

00:03:18.594 --> 00:03:21.810
And you also asked them their condition of their heart.

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:24.027
And what you get is something like this.

00:03:24.027 --> 00:03:28.652
So on the horizontal axis you plot sugar consumption

00:03:28.652 --> 00:03:32.780
and then on the vertical axis you plot heart disease risk

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:35.512
or their level of heart disease.

00:03:35.512 --> 00:03:40.908
Heart disease risk, let's say at 60.

00:03:41.862 --> 00:03:44.938
And you find a plot that looks something like this.

00:03:44.938 --> 00:03:46.474
So each of these points.

00:03:46.474 --> 00:03:51.736
This is someone who consumed 200 grams of sugar per day

00:03:51.736 --> 00:03:55.997
and they're now at high heart disease risk now at age 60.

00:03:55.997 --> 00:03:58.826
But maybe this is someone who is at low heart disease risk

00:03:58.826 --> 00:04:02.237
at age 60 even though they consumed a lot of sugar everyday.

00:04:02.806 --> 00:04:06.584
And so we just keep plotting all of these points.

00:04:07.476 --> 00:04:10.077
And you say, "Well, you know what, it does look"

00:04:10.077 --> 00:04:12.374
and obviously I'm not going to all 300.

00:04:12.374 --> 00:04:14.871
You say, "Well, actually, it looks like there is

00:04:14.871 --> 00:04:17.410
"a rough correlation right over here."

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:19.589
That if you tried to plot a line, there's

00:04:19.589 --> 00:04:22.338
definitely some outliers here, but it looks

00:04:22.338 --> 00:04:27.112
like there is a line that you could fit.

00:04:27.112 --> 00:04:30.237
And then you might say, "It looks like sugar and heart

00:04:30.237 --> 00:04:33.088
"disease risk at age 60, that they are correlated,

00:04:33.088 --> 00:04:35.066
"that they're related in this way, that they move together,

00:04:35.066 --> 00:04:36.910
"that if someone consumed a lot of sugar over

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:39.719
"the last 30 years they seem to have a worse

00:04:39.719 --> 00:04:43.094
"heart situation and if they consumed a lot lower sugar,

00:04:43.094 --> 00:04:47.072
"they seem to have a lower or better heart situation."

00:04:47.626 --> 00:04:51.653
This often happens in medical science, when people see

00:04:51.653 --> 00:04:53.989
something like this they often jump to the conclusion,

00:04:53.989 --> 00:04:57.486
oh therefore consuming more sugar

00:04:57.486 --> 00:05:00.199
must drive up heart disease risk.

00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:02.455
That's very dangerous because just seeing this data

00:05:02.455 --> 00:05:06.185
doesn't tell you that sugar is causing heart disease risk.

00:05:06.185 --> 00:05:08.351
It could go the other way around.

00:05:08.351 --> 00:05:10.853
It could be that people who end up having a high

00:05:10.853 --> 00:05:14.491
heart disease risk, maybe they crave sugar, but actually

00:05:14.491 --> 00:05:18.502
there's some other underlying cause that's making it happen.

00:05:18.502 --> 00:05:19.937
Maybe they have some other deficiency

00:05:19.937 --> 00:05:21.593
that's making them crave sugar.

00:05:21.593 --> 00:05:24.416
So it's not clear which way the causality is happening.

00:05:24.416 --> 00:05:27.568
Is the sugar consumption driving the unhealthy heart

00:05:27.568 --> 00:05:29.723
or is somehow the unhealthy heart driving the sugar

00:05:29.723 --> 00:05:32.289
consumption or maybe there's some other factor.

00:05:32.289 --> 00:05:35.251
Maybe fat consumption is driving the heart disease

00:05:35.251 --> 00:05:36.845
and maybe people who have more fat also

00:05:36.845 --> 00:05:39.388
will have more sugar or vice versa, who knows.

00:05:39.697 --> 00:05:42.427
All this is telling you is that there is a correlation.

00:05:42.427 --> 00:05:44.082
So this right over here, you would

00:05:44.082 --> 00:05:46.131
call this an observational study.

00:05:46.131 --> 00:05:48.020
You've observed a relationship, but you

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:50.399
really can't say what is causing what.

00:05:50.399 --> 00:05:51.807
So let me write this down.

00:05:51.807 --> 00:05:57.534
This is an observational study.

00:05:57.887 --> 00:06:01.304
You're probably saying, "Alright, then how could you prove

00:06:01.304 --> 00:06:05.564
"or feel better about the idea that sugar is actually a

00:06:05.564 --> 00:06:07.736
"cause, that there's actually causality there?"

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:12.924
To do that, you would actually have to run an experiment.

00:06:12.924 --> 00:06:15.115
An experiment.

00:06:15.115 --> 00:06:18.387
To do an experimental study here, what you

00:06:18.387 --> 00:06:20.944
would do is try to take two groups of folks.

00:06:20.944 --> 00:06:22.946
You would have your experimental group.

00:06:22.946 --> 00:06:24.893
So that's your experimental group.

00:06:24.893 --> 00:06:26.998
Actually, let me make it a circle

00:06:26.998 --> 00:06:29.768
here so it's a pool of people.

00:06:29.768 --> 00:06:33.827
Let's say you have 100 people that are experimental.

00:06:33.827 --> 00:06:35.589
That's your experimental pool.

00:06:35.589 --> 00:06:37.716
Then you have your control.

00:06:37.716 --> 00:06:39.880
You have your control.

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:43.364
What you would do, if you wanted to run this type of

00:06:43.364 --> 00:06:45.839
experiment and as we'll see, this type of experiment

00:06:45.839 --> 00:06:48.443
probably wouldn't be run because some would consider it

00:06:48.443 --> 00:06:51.541
unethical or actually I would consider it unethical as well.

00:06:51.541 --> 00:06:53.389
But what you would do is you would randomly, let's say

00:06:53.389 --> 00:06:56.380
take 30 year olds, you would randomly take 30 year olds

00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:58.217
and put them in one of these two groups.

00:06:58.217 --> 00:07:00.506
Once again, when we say randomly, you don't want to put

00:07:00.506 --> 00:07:02.600
all the healthy people in one group and all the unhealthy

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:04.539
people in the other group or vice versa.

00:07:04.539 --> 00:07:06.283
You want it to be random, you don't want to put all of the

00:07:06.283 --> 00:07:09.049
people of one type, one demographic, one economic status

00:07:09.049 --> 00:07:11.243
in one group or the other, you want it to be random.

00:07:11.243 --> 00:07:16.520
So you randomly put people into these two groups and then

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:19.515
the experimental group, you would change one variable.

00:07:19.515 --> 00:07:21.565
The variable you care about is sugar.

00:07:21.565 --> 00:07:24.376
So what you might say is, "Okay, all of the people in this

00:07:24.376 --> 00:07:27.068
"group right over here, whatever sugar that they would have

00:07:27.068 --> 00:07:30.485
"consumed, on top of that they have to drink, I don't know,

00:07:30.485 --> 00:07:32.961
"they have to drink a cup of syrup every night or they

00:07:32.961 --> 00:07:36.058
"have to have a minimum sugar intake."

00:07:36.058 --> 00:07:39.189
So that you essentially force sugar into this group

00:07:40.203 --> 00:07:42.766
that you're not forcing into this group.

00:07:42.766 --> 00:07:46.149
And then 30 years later, so one, this is probably unethical

00:07:46.149 --> 00:07:49.488
to force people to have something that is very likely

00:07:49.488 --> 00:07:52.299
not good for their health and then you would have to run

00:07:52.299 --> 00:07:55.813
it for a long period of time, you would wait 30 years.

00:07:55.813 --> 00:07:59.135
You would wait 30 years when they're 60 years old and

00:07:59.135 --> 00:08:02.372
you would see what was the heart condition of these folks.

00:08:02.372 --> 00:08:04.361
How many people maybe had heart attacks?

00:08:04.361 --> 00:08:09.815
At age 60, what is their health condition?

00:08:09.815 --> 00:08:14.518
And then statistically, is it unlikely that the

00:08:14.518 --> 00:08:20.499
difference would be due purely to chance alone?

00:08:20.499 --> 00:08:23.257
For example, if you did this, and let's say that yeah these

00:08:23.257 --> 00:08:27.071
people had a slightly higher chance for heart disease

00:08:27.071 --> 00:08:29.512
or heart attacks than these folks after 30 years.

00:08:29.512 --> 00:08:34.719
It would be a good experiment, but it wouldn't allow you

00:08:34.719 --> 00:08:36.784
to conclude that sugar is causing it, cause that might

00:08:36.784 --> 00:08:38.890
have happened through chance alone.

00:08:38.890 --> 00:08:41.989
But if, for example, after 30 years, let's say this group

00:08:41.989 --> 00:08:45.214
right over here has 10 times the risk of a heart attack or

00:08:45.214 --> 00:08:49.753
10 times of whatever the risk factors for heart disease.

00:08:49.753 --> 00:08:52.779
You would statistically say the odds of that happening

00:08:52.779 --> 00:08:55.963
by chance alone, that the 100 people in this group right

00:08:55.963 --> 00:08:59.666
over here having 10 times the chance of heart attack as this

00:08:59.666 --> 00:09:02.892
group right over here, that's unlikely due to chance alone.

00:09:02.892 --> 00:09:04.201
So you would say, "Okay!"

00:09:04.201 --> 00:09:05.923
We would feel good about our conclusion that

00:09:05.923 --> 00:09:09.159
this forced sugar is what is causing that.

00:09:09.621 --> 00:09:12.685
Anyway, we'll dig deeper into each of these three types,

00:09:12.685 --> 00:09:14.753
but the whole point of this video is to just give you an

00:09:14.753 --> 00:09:17.148
appreciation that, you know, we use statistics a lot, but

00:09:17.148 --> 00:09:19.505
this gives you a context for how we're using it in different

00:09:19.505 --> 00:09:22.613
situations when we're performing statistical studies.

00:09:22.613 --> 00:09:26.261
This is to estimate the true parameter for a population.

00:09:26.261 --> 00:09:28.833
What is the actual sugar intake for the population?

00:09:29.064 --> 00:09:32.126
You randomly sample and then you use that sample data

00:09:32.126 --> 00:09:35.521
to create a statistic that estimates the true parameter.

00:09:35.521 --> 00:09:37.985
Observational study, you observe what's going on.

00:09:37.985 --> 00:09:40.182
Sugar intake versus heart risk.

00:09:40.182 --> 00:09:42.694
You say, "Hey, there's a relationship maybe

00:09:42.694 --> 00:09:44.852
"this is worth doing an experiment on."

00:09:44.852 --> 00:09:46.448
Because only through an experiment could

00:09:46.448 --> 00:09:50.369
you attempt to find some type of causality.
