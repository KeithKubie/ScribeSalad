&gt;&gt; SURYA: Hi, I'm Amanda Surya from Google
Developer Relations Team and in this video;

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:11.099
I will show you how you can utilize the YouTube
Direct Tool to solicit user generated video,

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:16.460
moderate relay submissions and display approved
videos on your website. Let's start by going

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:21.149
to YouTube Directs prio page where you can
download the latest code and read the Getting

00:00:21.149 --> 00:00:26.159
Started Guide. The guide will walk you through
the steps of deploying your own instance of

00:00:26.159 --> 00:00:32.320
YouTube Direct to Google App Engine, Google's
scalable hosting platform. Once you have successfully

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:37.410
deployed YouTube Direct to Google App Engine,
you can log in to the Admin interface. The

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:46.510
URL is going to be your appid.[INDISTINCT].com/admin.
Now, let's say that I have this blog about

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:52.499
travel to Asia and I want to solicit videos
from my readers around the topic. I will first

00:00:52.499 --> 00:01:01.589
need to go to the admin panel to create a
new assignment. I'll set it to the right category,

00:01:01.589 --> 00:01:13.821
set the status as active to enable video submission
and put a description to the assignment. Once

00:01:13.821 --> 00:01:20.270
the assignment is created, I can get the app
loader code for that assignment and you copy

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:39.700
this code and paste it unto the page where
I want the app loader to appear,

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:47.210
click save, refresh and the app loader eye
frame appears on the page. Now, my readers

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:52.130
can start submitting their videos in response
to my blog post and they have two options

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:57.810
to do this. They can upload a new video or
submit an existing video that they already

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:10.750
own. Let me submit a video that I own under
my YouTube account. All I need to do is copy

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:23.160
and paste the URL. Once videos have been submitted
through the app loader, I can go back to YouTube

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:36.440
Direct Admin Panel to moderate the videos.

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:41.800
There's the video that I just submitted, the
status is unreviewed. As an admin, I can preview

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:56.130
the video and look at the details and once
I'm satisfied, I can approve it. Now that

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:01.440
I have an approved video, I can go back to
the assignment to get the code to display

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:28.170
the approved videos and you copy this code
and simply paste it unto my page,

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:34.680
refresh and as you can see, your true video
was automatically added to the playlist and

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:45.900
that completes our overview of YouTube Direct.
You can download the code at code.google.com/p/youtube-direct.

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:46.660
Thanks for watching.
