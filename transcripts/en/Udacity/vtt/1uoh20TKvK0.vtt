[Sebastian Thrun - Research Professor, Stanford University - Fellow and VP, Google] So this is a really exciting event for us.

00:00:04.004 --> 00:00:07.053
We are launching now our new University Udacity. This is our very first class with David.

00:00:07.053 --> 00:00:09.086
David, what is this class all about?

00:00:09.086 --> 00:00:11.048
[David Evans - Professor, University of Virginia]
So welcome to the first class.

00:00:11.048 --> 00:00:14.014
This is a class that's going to introduce you to computer science,

00:00:14.014 --> 00:00:17.000
and we're going to do that by building a search engine.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
You're not expected to have any previous background in computing to take this class.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
It's fine if you've never programmed before. That's what we expect.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
You're going to learn some of the core ideas in computer science.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
You're going to learn to program in a language called Python,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
and you're going to build a search engine that by the end of 7 weeks

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.039
will have all the main components of a search engine like Google in it.

00:00:33.067 --> 00:00:36.080
Learning about computing is really one of the most powerful things you can do.

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:40.038
Computers are these amazing machines that can be programmed to do anything.

00:00:40.038 --> 00:00:43.077
And once you learn a little bit about programming, you can sort of start to envision

00:00:43.077 --> 00:00:46.050
the power that you have, the things that you can build with computers.

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.008
One of the great things about computing is that you don't really need a lot of resources

00:00:50.008 --> 00:00:51.066
to build something that can change the world.

00:00:51.066 --> 00:00:53.077
If you learn a little bit, if you have a creative idea,

00:00:53.077 --> 00:00:57.035
you can build something, you can deploy your application to millions of people

00:00:57.035 --> 00:01:00.037
on the Internet, and it doesn't really take a lot of resources to do that.

00:01:00.037 --> 00:01:03.004
It just takes a little creativity and a little bit of knowledge.

00:01:03.004 --> 00:01:05.064
So David, this is really exciting. I'm looking forward to seeing your class.

00:01:05.064 --> 00:01:09.033
I'll be making occasional appearances, but I have my own class to teach.

00:01:09.033 --> 00:01:12.063
But David will teach this wonderful class, and I think we should just dive in.

00:01:12.063 --> 99:59:59.000
Great! Well, let's get started.
