00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:04.290
Abe went running 4
days this past week.

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.540
He ran 9 kilometers on each day.

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:13.184
In that same week, Beth ran
15 fewer kilometers than Abe.

00:00:13.184 --> 00:00:17.520
How many kilometers
did Beth run that week?

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.792
So I encourage you
to pause this video

00:00:19.792 --> 00:00:21.750
and to try this on your
own, try to figure out,

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.960
how many kilometers
did Beth run that week?

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:27.500
So there's a couple
of ways to think

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.860
about it or a couple of
ways to visualize it.

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:31.470
The first thing we
might want to do--

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.595
in fact, the first thing
we definitely want to do--

00:00:33.595 --> 00:00:37.600
is to figure out, well, how
far did Abe run in that week?

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.620
Well, he went 4 days, and each
day, he went 9 kilometers.

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:45.015
So we could say
that he went-- let

00:00:45.015 --> 00:00:50.720
me do that blue color-- 4 days
times 9 kilometers per day.

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:52.440
And we could visualize that.

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.830
So this is how much
he went in one day.

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:57.370
This is how much he
went in two days.

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:59.910
This is how much he'd
go in three days.

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.600
This is how much he
would go in four days.

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:04.440
So what is this?

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:10.690
What is 4 times 9 kilometers?

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:15.030
Well, this is essentially
9 plus 9 plus 9 plus 9.

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.460
So we could just add up the 9's.

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:22.850
9 plus 9 is 18, plus
9 is 27, plus 9 is 36.

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:25.986
So he ran a total
of 36 kilometers.

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:31.450
Now, that's not what
they're asking us for.

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:33.840
They're asking us for
the number of kilometers

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.060
Beth ran that week.

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:39.730
And they tell us that she ran
15 fewer kilometers than Abe.

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:43.130
So this right over here,
Abe's total distance--

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:44.760
if we start from
here, and we were

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:50.600
to go all the way over the
week, all the way to here,

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.600
he ran 36 total kilometers.

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.930
Beth ran 15 fewer
kilometers than Abe.

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:59.345
So let's go back 15 kilometers.

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:09.139
So Beth ran 15 fewer
kilometers than Abe.

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:12.960
So that's 15 fewer kilometers.

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:16.560
And so the number of
kilometers that Beth ran

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.710
would be this distance.

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:22.830
It would be this
distance right over here.

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:25.110
So this is kilometers Beth ran.

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:33.490
Let me write it like this--
Beth's distance in the week.

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:37.220
Beth's distance would be this
distance right over here.

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.176
So how do we figure that out?

00:02:39.176 --> 00:02:40.800
Well, if we say Beth's
distance-- let's

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.200
just use the letter
B for shorthand.

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:51.300
So Beth's distance
plus 15 kilometers

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:53.860
is going to be equal
to Abe's distance, is

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:57.420
going to be equal
to 36 kilometers.

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:02.970
Or another way of thinking
about it-- Beth's distance

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:13.540
is going to be equal to Abe's
distance, so 36 kilometers,

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:15.550
minus 15.

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:19.640
So what is Beth's distance
going to be equal to?

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:23.090
Well, 36 minus 15--
6 minus 5 is 1.

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:24.590
30 minus 10 is 20.

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:26.280
So it's going to be 21.

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:30.732
So Beth's distance
is 21 kilometers.
