00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.740
&gt;&gt; Today we have with us Josh Bazell.
Josh has a B.A. in English literature and

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:12.549
writing from Brown University and an M.D.
from Columbia.

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:16.039
Currently, he's a resident at the University
of California in San Francisco, just down

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:19.510
the way.
And he wrote, "Beat the Reaper," while completing

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:23.720
his internship at a hospital -- not at all
like the one that is described in the book.

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:27.820
Beat the Reaper has been described as "A hypochondriac's
nightmare and a reader's dream."

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:29.961
And it's his first book.
I believe he's working on a second.

00:00:29.961 --> 00:00:33.180
So please welcome today, Josh Bazell.

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.930
&gt;&gt; [Clapping]

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:36.680
&gt;&gt; [pause]

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:47.280
Josh Bazell: Okay. Wait.
So this is actually -- I need to stand at

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.280
the podium too?

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:49.560
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so the.

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:55.010
Josh Bazell: Okay. Hi, I'm Josh Bazell. Thanks
for having me.

00:00:55.010 --> 00:01:02.239
That's my dog Lotty, by the way, who appears
in various guises in the book several times.

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:10.040
I'm
sorry that this is a lunch-hour thing, because

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:15.990
I was going to talk about actually an incident
that began -- for me, about two months ago

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.170
 -- when I got barfed on by a kid with swine
flu. [laughter]

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.170
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible]

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:25.630
Josh Bazell: Okay. I will do that.
I was on an airplane and they asked for a

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:30.960
doctor and I was asleep.
And so, I said, "Oh, I'm a doctor."

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:36.510
I mean, I woke up from it.
And the two people who announced themselves

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:45.440
on the plane were me and -- I'm on the sort
of indeterminant leave from my psychiatry

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:53.970
residency at UCSF, and the other guy was a
cardiologist who was sheik and had a turban.

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.909
So they were like, "We'll take the guy without
the turban."

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:03.220
And I ended up taking care of this kid, which
was fairly straightforward -- had mostly to

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:08.509
do with the people on the plane wanting to
stone him to death for having swine flu.

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:13.680
He was about nine and had been put on this
plane by himself by his mother who also had

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.910
swine flu.
I mean, it was an ugly story, but it certainly

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:22.310
wasn't the kid's fault.
He was so ill that the flight attendants just

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:28.301
noticed him in his seat as being sick.
So, you know, I spent sometime with him -- gave

00:02:28.301 --> 00:02:31.750
him some fluids and so forth.
And the next day, I started to feel a little

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:38.670
under the weather, because I'm as hypochondriacal
as the next person.

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:44.560
And I called in a prescription for myself
 -- which was something we can do for non-controlled

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:50.200
substances -- for tamiflu.
And when I went to pick it up, I was told

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:55.270
by the pharmacy that my insurance company
said I had no insurance and hadn't for six

00:02:55.270 --> 00:03:00.190
months.
I'm on Cobra at the moment, and what's interesting

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:05.890
is, I've made four Cobra payments and all
four of them have resulted in the insurance

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:09.970
company saying they never got payment and
cutting me from the rolls, but also cashing

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:14.060
the checks.
And it wasn't this time a particularly big

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:18.019
deal, because I'd been through it three times
before.

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:21.670
I know what to do in terms of getting the
check copies and who to call and stuff.

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:24.420
It took about ten hours of work over the course
of a week.

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:29.319
And then, they said it was a mistake, which
is what has happened the previous times.

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:32.860
But what's kind of distressing -- because
it's not a big deal.

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:37.870
It wasn't in this case.
I mean, I didn't certainly die of swine flu.

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:43.629
What's kind of distressing is the clear implication
that if I were say, in a car accident, and

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:48.510
someone were to call my insurance company
 -- which incidentally they do from the ambulance

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:54.860
 -- and it absolutely changes the course of
your health care from the moment they find

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:58.569
you in terms of what hospital they sent you
to and so forth.

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:03.739
If they had done that, the insurance company
would have said I was not insured and it would

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:06.459
have just been a very different course of
care.

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:13.530
And it occurred to me to wonder -- not so
much how insurance companies could operate

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:18.609
like that, because they're companies and they're
going to be as rapacious as they're allowed

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:22.449
to be.
I'm not that interested in the individuals

00:04:22.449 --> 00:04:27.639
who work for these companies, because I think
it's, you know -- people are scared right

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:33.040
now and they're very shortsighted.
There's this sort of epidemic in the country

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:36.520
of this thing called 'family values' -- which
means that, if you care for your family, you

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:41.499
don't have to care for anybody else.
But I was slightly curious about why the rules

00:04:41.499 --> 00:04:48.080
are so lax in terms of insurance companies.
And the same thing is true with pharmaceutical

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:52.460
companies.
I don't know if you guys know this, but basically,

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:56.759
the issue with pharmaceutical companies is
advertising.

00:04:56.759 --> 00:04:59.210
They all spend more on advertising than they
do on research.

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:03.159
They advertise to doctors.
They advertise, "Oh, hello."

00:05:03.159 --> 00:05:11.529
Sorry, I didn't mean to embarrass you. [chuckle]
So they advertise to consumers directly, which

00:05:11.529 --> 00:05:13.780
is legal in this country.
It's also legal in New Zealand.

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:18.870
It's not legal in any other industrialized
country, but it will be soon, because the

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:23.819
Internet has made it basically impossible
to keep advertisements out of any specific

00:05:23.819 --> 00:05:30.319
country.
And you know, these rules that they have -- the

00:05:30.319 --> 00:05:34.629
pharmaceutical industry in particular -- the
rule that really favors them is one that the

00:05:34.629 --> 00:05:41.780
FDA has, which is that, If you invent a new
medication, all you have to do to get it approved

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:47.229
to show that it has some advantage over placebo.
You don't have to test it against medications

00:05:47.229 --> 00:05:51.309
that are already on the market.
The result of this is, if you invent a medication

00:05:51.309 --> 00:05:55.669
that works one-sixth as well as something
that's already out there and has ten times

00:05:55.669 --> 00:06:00.229
as many side effects, you can nonetheless
spend a billion dollars advertising it and

00:06:00.229 --> 00:06:04.669
make reliably 2.1 billion dollars.
And obviously, they're going to do this, because

00:06:04.669 --> 00:06:09.059
they're allowed to do this.
And they're allowed to do this because they

00:06:09.059 --> 00:06:14.740
pay our Congress people.
There's been an interesting jump this year.

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:20.839
In 2008, the health care industry paid members
of Congress about $95 million.

00:06:20.839 --> 00:06:29.289
This year so far, it's about $390 million.
And again, they get what they want out of

00:06:29.289 --> 00:06:32.629
that.
They also do other interesting things.

00:06:32.629 --> 00:06:36.979
Sanofi Pasteur is particularly interesting
company in that they got $10 million from

00:06:36.979 --> 00:06:43.379
the bailout, which they seemed to have spent
entirely on hiring DLA Piper, which -- at

00:06:43.379 --> 00:06:48.839
the time -- was starring former Senate majority
leader Dick Army, the Republican.

00:06:48.839 --> 00:06:54.219
And what they did for Sanofi was send fake
protesters to town hall meetings this summer,

00:06:54.219 --> 00:07:00.749
which was incredibly effective.
I just started wondering after my own insurance

00:07:00.749 --> 00:07:09.509
run-in, why any of this is legal.
And I just found the answer to be somewhat

00:07:09.509 --> 00:07:13.020
interesting.
I thought, you know, perhaps there ought to

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:20.340
be laws against buying off your Congress people.
And it turns out that there, in fact, are

00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:21.490
laws.
There are many laws.

00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:27.960
One in particular is U.S. Code 18201, which
says that you cannot give any member of Congress

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:35.669
 -- past, present, or future -- any consideration
in return for a decision that they make in

00:07:35.669 --> 00:07:40.580
the course of their duties.
And the Senate Ethics Committee Handbook sums

00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:47.239
this up as saying, "Don't take anything of
value from anyone for doing anything."

00:07:47.239 --> 00:07:51.270
So it would seem, sort of on the face of it,
that for these guys -- when you start out

00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:59.389
in the Senate you make about $185,000 a year,
which seems like a fair amount to me given

00:07:59.389 --> 00:08:03.669
that the job is apparently so easy you can
run for President full-time while doing it.

00:08:03.669 --> 00:08:08.589
But just for comparison, it's about four times
as much as you can make as a firefighter in

00:08:08.589 --> 00:08:11.740
the U.S.
after 20 years on the job anywhere in the

00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:15.000
country.
But this amount for key members of Congress

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:19.429
is absolutely dwarfed by the money coming
in from these companies.

00:08:19.429 --> 00:08:27.169
And why is that legal?
Well, there are various loopholes.

00:08:27.169 --> 00:08:33.180
For instance, the major one is this sort of
fiction that, If you donate to a candidate's

00:08:33.180 --> 00:08:37.519
campaign, you are not giving them something
of any value.

00:08:37.519 --> 00:08:40.759
This is the way it's sort of treated.
Money goes into campaigns.

00:08:40.759 --> 00:08:47.250
Incidentally though, the limit that a campaign
can accept is $2,500 from a person and zero

00:08:47.250 --> 00:08:51.980
from a corporation.
You have to launder the money through political

00:08:51.980 --> 00:09:00.720
action committees, which is done all the time.
And the basis of this acceptance of this practice

00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:06.940
is twofold.
One is the argument that "Corporations have

00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:11.949
to be able to donate to campaigns somehow
to level the playing field, otherwise new

00:09:11.949 --> 00:09:17.930
candidates will have no chance of raising
money." which I think is a legitimate concern,

00:09:17.930 --> 00:09:23.360
although it's hard to see how it actually
works since the incumbents are so heavily

00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:27.040
favored in most Senate races right now.
And they get the most of the money, which

00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:33.720
sort of causes the system to persist.
But the more interesting concept is that the

00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:39.510
corporations have First Amendment rights and
also Fourteenth Amendment protections.

00:09:39.510 --> 00:09:47.500
Are you guys familiar with the Fourteenth
Amendment?

00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:53.019
Basically, this was an amendment in 1868 that
was designed entirely to overturn the Dred

00:09:53.019 --> 00:09:59.639
Scott decision and give black people rights
in the U.S. after the Civil War.

00:09:59.639 --> 00:10:07.360
And it did that fairly well.
And then, in 1886 -- right in our neck of

00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:14.790
the woods -- there was a law case called Santa
Rosa vs. Pacific Southern Railroad, in which

00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:21.490
the railroad was saying they wanted a tax
break from land that they owned that was losing

00:10:21.490 --> 00:10:25.290
value.
They wanted to amortize their losses as taxes.

00:10:25.290 --> 00:10:30.220
And they did win the case.
And the decision doesn't mention the Fourteenth

00:10:30.220 --> 00:10:34.470
Amendment at all, but there's something called
the 'head note', which was written by the

00:10:34.470 --> 00:10:39.670
stenographer in the case -- who, interestingly,
was employed at the time by the Southern Pacific

00:10:39.670 --> 00:10:45.170
Railroad.
And he said in passing that the justices felt

00:10:45.170 --> 00:10:54.029
strongly that corporations, like individuals,
should have Fourteenth Amendment protections.

00:10:54.029 --> 00:10:57.810
This is one of the most important Supreme
Court decisions of all time.

00:10:57.810 --> 00:11:05.360
I mean, it's not even a decision. It's quasi.
Numerous justices have pointed it out as being

00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:13.930
possibly the most operative law in the country.
There's a case going on right now called Citizens

00:11:13.930 --> 00:11:19.569
United vs. Federal Election Committee, which
is more commonly known as the People vs. Hillary

00:11:19.569 --> 00:11:24.170
Clinton case.
Do you guys know this?

00:11:24.170 --> 00:11:29.670
During the recent election cycle, this group
called Citizens United made a movie about

00:11:29.670 --> 00:11:34.949
Hillary Clinton that sort of hatchet piece
that the Federal Elections Commission said

00:11:34.949 --> 00:11:40.769
that they could not show within 60 days of
the election, because you can't air issue

00:11:40.769 --> 00:11:44.550
ads by third parties within 60 days of an
election.

00:11:44.550 --> 00:11:47.769
And they are suing right now.
The case has reached the Supreme Court.

00:11:47.769 --> 00:11:53.270
Actually, the arguments have already been
heard before the start of the session, which

00:11:53.270 --> 00:11:57.110
was -- is it still October?
It is -- which was earlier this month.

00:11:57.110 --> 00:12:01.019
It was actually -- on September ninth, there
was an emergency session.

00:12:01.019 --> 00:12:05.630
Sonya Sotomayor was sworn in early just for
this session and they went and heard these

00:12:05.630 --> 00:12:10.649
arguments.
But there's no -- and it's possible that the

00:12:10.649 --> 00:12:14.480
Supreme Court will say, "Well, this is too
specific a case, and we're going to deal with

00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:18.290
this case and not the larger case law."
But it's also likely -- given the make-up

00:12:18.290 --> 00:12:21.379
of the Supreme Court -- that they're going
to uphold Fourteenth Amendment rights for

00:12:21.379 --> 00:12:26.440
corporations.
Incidentally, the original case in 1886 -- if

00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:30.800
the Supreme Court really did say that corporations
should have Fourteenth Amendment -- means

00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:36.160
that corporations got equal rights and citizenship
protection well before women did, on the order

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:43.560
of about 40 years.
So this is the issue; this is what we're facing.

00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:48.500
What's interesting, to me, about corporations
is that they're kind of like vampires.

00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:53.649
I mean, not in the parasitic way, although
certainly pharmaceutical companies and insurance

00:12:53.649 --> 00:12:57.640
companies are that.
But just in the sense that, When you give

00:12:57.640 --> 00:13:03.709
a person protection and you give them citizenship,
they eventually tend to die, and that sort

00:13:03.709 --> 00:13:09.620
of evens things out -- at least a little bit,
depending on what the inheritance laws are.

00:13:09.620 --> 00:13:16.730
With corporations, that's just not the case.
Corporations can theoretically go on forever.

00:13:16.730 --> 00:13:23.050
And they don't have to -- you know, there
are not issues with movement of their resources.

00:13:23.050 --> 00:13:29.069
So that's really kind of what we're up against.
I should say my book, Beat the Reaper, is

00:13:29.069 --> 00:13:33.569
a sort of nuar comedy about hospital life
in the Mafia, which has nothing to do with

00:13:33.569 --> 00:13:38.050
any of this.
But one thing that I was kind of wondering,

00:13:38.050 --> 00:13:41.689
because when you work as a physician, there's
this sort of scorpions-in-a-bottle scenario

00:13:41.689 --> 00:13:45.519
that you often face, where the patients are
furious at you, doctors are often really angry

00:13:45.519 --> 00:13:48.490
too.
And I think it's mostly because they're the

00:13:48.490 --> 00:13:53.050
two parties that they see.
And things are not going well with health

00:13:53.050 --> 00:14:01.740
care right now.
Actually, I say in the book at one point -- there's

00:14:01.740 --> 00:14:07.440
a patient in a very fancy ward at this hospital
and I make the point -- which incidentally

00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:11.459
is accurate -- that these fancy wards often
have the worst health care in the hospital.

00:14:11.459 --> 00:14:16.129
They tend to be sort of retirement legs for
people who are done with their work elsewhere

00:14:16.129 --> 00:14:20.149
in the hospital.
And the comment that I make is that, "If you

00:14:20.149 --> 00:14:24.680
don't believe that health care can be worse
 -- even if you pay much more money for it

00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:29.149
 -- you should forget these polls about how
the U.S. is the 37th ranked health care system

00:14:29.149 --> 00:14:37.639
and just take a look at Michael Jackson."
I was in Spain two weeks ago and the translation

00:14:37.639 --> 00:14:45.319
of the book -- they use a different verb for
"take a look at."

00:14:45.319 --> 00:14:49.300
It's 'fijarse', which is sort of like 'fixate
on'.

00:14:49.300 --> 00:14:52.810
And the implication seemed to be there that
I had somehow predicted that Jackson was going

00:14:52.810 --> 00:14:56.920
to die -- which is not at all the case, but
was very exciting for me at the time.

00:14:56.920 --> 00:15:02.459
They were asking me, you know, who else was
going to go, and that kind of thing.

00:15:02.459 --> 00:15:08.640
Why am I on this topic?
I don't know. Anyway. It's interesting.

00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:15.689
I mean, to me, Google's sort of fascinating.
Google is at the very beginning of its lifespan,

00:15:15.689 --> 00:15:24.269
which we don't get to see all that often.
It's also a company -- I mean, we have an

00:15:24.269 --> 00:15:28.550
idea of what Microsoft was like at its absolute
inception, but it also seems to have been

00:15:28.550 --> 00:15:34.749
run really by two guys for years.
Whereas Google, very quickly, has enjoyed

00:15:34.749 --> 00:15:40.290
many more employees.
And it's just -- it's curious to watch from

00:15:40.290 --> 00:15:43.820
the outside, particularly if you're from San
Francisco.

00:15:43.820 --> 00:15:52.850
So I'm curious -- maybe you don't want to
answer this on tape, but -- is there a sense

00:15:52.850 --> 00:15:56.749
of sort of 'democratic governance' in this
company?

00:15:56.749 --> 00:16:02.029
Like, do you guys feel like you could shift
company policy?

00:16:02.029 --> 00:16:08.230
Okay. I'll take that as a neither/nor.
I mean, I can tell you as a civilian and a

00:16:08.230 --> 00:16:15.589
nonGoogle member.
The question that's on my mind is -- because

00:16:15.589 --> 00:16:24.129
Google has this motto of, what is it?
Don't do evil. Don't be evil. Don't see, hear,

00:16:24.129 --> 00:16:27.410
or speak? [laughter]
Right. "Do no evil."

00:16:27.410 --> 00:16:31.130
And it seems to me they've done pretty well
at that at the time.

00:16:31.130 --> 00:16:34.699
I mean, obviously there have been these sort
of tough squabbles with the China situation

00:16:34.699 --> 00:16:38.140
and so forth.
But the question is, Is Google going to get

00:16:38.140 --> 00:16:40.860
tired of being Google at some point and sell
the information base?

00:16:40.860 --> 00:16:44.819
-- which would be really only one evil act,
but it would be pretty evil.

00:16:44.819 --> 00:16:49.829
It would go backwards and forwards in time
and would negate a lot of what we love about

00:16:49.829 --> 00:16:54.610
Google so much.
So, as a side note, I would like to simply

00:16:54.610 --> 00:17:00.351
say, "Please don't do that." [laughter]
And that's pretty much all I have to say.

00:17:00.351 --> 00:17:04.323
[laughter]
If anybody has any questions, I'm happy to

00:17:04.323 --> 00:17:05.323
answer.

00:17:05.323 --> 00:17:11.520
Q Did you talk about writing in the book at
all while you were working in your position

00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:12.520
there?

00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:15.569
Josh Bazell: Yeah, I wrote this book during
my last year of med school and my first year

00:17:15.569 --> 00:17:24.699
of residency, which is also called 'internship.'
And it seems -- I mean, people always say,

00:17:24.699 --> 00:17:28.779
"Oh, how did you do that? That's so insane."
It's not that insane.

00:17:28.779 --> 00:17:31.159
The last year of medical school is relatively
cushy.

00:17:31.159 --> 00:17:36.820
And even -- the thing that's great about internship
is, it is at times extremely time consuming,

00:17:36.820 --> 00:17:41.049
but it tends also to be very ordered.
Like, you know in advance on a month-to-month

00:17:41.049 --> 00:17:43.049
basis what your free time is going to look
like.

00:17:43.049 --> 00:17:47.360
And if you're willing to have sort of "no
life outside of writing and medicine" -- which

00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:52.580
I was willing to do at the time.
I mean, it really wasn't -- it was not so

00:17:52.580 --> 00:17:55.870
much of a hassle.
I've been writing my whole life.

00:17:55.870 --> 00:18:01.180
I started wanting to be a novelist when I
was nine, after reading The Godfather and

00:18:01.180 --> 00:18:05.919
Jaws -- both of which sort of manifest heavily
in this book.

00:18:05.919 --> 00:18:12.640
And I've worked as a professional writer for
sixteen years.

00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:17.980
Most of that was in movies.
This is my first published book.

00:18:17.980 --> 00:18:18.980
So it was pretty reflexive.

00:18:18.980 --> 00:18:25.960
Q What led you to want to eventually go from
that goal of wanting to be a full-time writer

00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:26.960
to medicine?

00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:31.850
Josh Bazell: I always wanted to go to med
school for several reasons.

00:18:31.850 --> 00:18:34.600
One, just that it was interesting.
Like, I wanted to know that stuff.

00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:40.000
And I found like I wasn't really able to learn
it on my own.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:43.590
I mean, it's almost like a drive for trivia
on the one hand.

00:18:43.590 --> 00:18:48.140
The other issue was, I was in a Ph.D. program
in English literature at Duke.

00:18:48.140 --> 00:18:53.050
And I was so depressed that I thought, "If
I'm going to be this depressed for this many

00:18:53.050 --> 00:18:58.570
years, I might as well go into medicine where,
whatever I'm feeling, at least I'm helping

00:18:58.570 --> 00:19:03.940
somebody else in the course of the day." [laughter]
And I have to say, medicine is fantastic for

00:19:03.940 --> 00:19:07.740
that. I mean, it really is.
It really doesn't matter how you're feeling.

00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:13.350
You really can actually -- I mean, you can
make a slight difference each day almost by

00:19:13.350 --> 00:19:19.210
default.
And that was very helpful to me.

00:19:19.210 --> 00:19:24.620
It's tough now that I'm on leave, actually.
I mean, what's weird is, like -- I'm on leave.

00:19:24.620 --> 00:19:31.240
I'm not even doing that much writing.
I mean, thankfully, the book has been a big

00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:35.429
hit worldwide.
It's out in 35 languages now.

00:19:35.429 --> 00:19:40.770
And the result is that I often travel to countries
that are releasing it on these sort of staggered

00:19:40.770 --> 00:19:45.100
schedules.
And it often seems like my full-time job now

00:19:45.100 --> 00:19:48.480
is publicity, which is not something I ever
had an interest in.

00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:53.310
I'm not particularly good at it.
And it's just interesting.

00:19:53.310 --> 00:20:02.600
I mean, on the axis of how one lives one's
life from say a zero of "going into banking,

00:20:02.600 --> 00:20:07.190
going to marry somebody else in banking, we're
going to get a nanny to take care of our child

00:20:07.190 --> 00:20:12.960
who will eventually go into banking" [laughter]
And to say at the top like, "I'm going to

00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:18.860
be a nun and help the poor in India."
I do feel like I backslid a little bit in

00:20:18.860 --> 00:20:20.190
the last year.
Sir.

00:20:20.190 --> 00:20:28.330
Q In terms of reforming the health care system,
how do you assess the strength and weakness

00:20:28.330 --> 00:20:31.730
of fictional writing versus [inaudible]?

00:20:31.730 --> 00:20:39.100
Josh Bazell: Right. Well, fictional writing
is a lot easier to do.

00:20:39.100 --> 00:20:44.799
I wonder sometimes if it's sheer laziness
that drives me down the fictional route, although

00:20:44.799 --> 00:20:52.279
I love fiction. I read fiction all the time.
I have written a series of essays about the

00:20:52.279 --> 00:20:57.460
health care debate, so called.
It's not really a debate.

00:20:57.460 --> 00:21:02.150
I mean, any doctor who actually cares about
his or her patients knows that 'single payer'

00:21:02.150 --> 00:21:05.390
is the way to go.
And the 'public option' is the sort of second

00:21:05.390 --> 00:21:08.519
best.
I mean, there is no debate other than corporations

00:21:08.519 --> 00:21:16.279
successfully advertising and buying senators.
I have written about it.

00:21:16.279 --> 00:21:26.210
I have much less success as a nonfiction writer.
I do occasional pieces in the New York Times,

00:21:26.210 --> 00:21:31.140
which is fun, but they like me to be sort
of less serious.

00:21:31.140 --> 00:21:37.650
I assume that's what you mean as sort of editorializing
rather than publishing studies.

00:21:37.650 --> 00:21:46.220
Q I was thinking about some of those articles
in the New Yorker magazine.

00:21:46.220 --> 00:21:48.559
I don't even call it [inaudible]

00:21:48.559 --> 00:21:53.340
Josh Bazell: Atul Gawande is a surgeon at
Harvard who has written frequently.

00:21:53.340 --> 00:21:56.330
And obviously Malcolm Gladwell does a lot
also.

00:21:56.330 --> 00:22:07.919
Q Yeah, right. I was just curious about your
perspective on the impact.

00:22:07.919 --> 00:22:08.919
I mean, impact in all different kinds of venues
of fiction versus nonfiction quarterly article.

00:22:08.919 --> 00:22:15.690
Josh Bazell: I think also it's a little -- I
did a talk that ended up being somewhat of

00:22:15.690 --> 00:22:24.049
a debate with a pharm rep recently, because
the pharm rep had gotten up and said, "We

00:22:24.049 --> 00:22:28.429
haven't published this, but we had data that
 -- not only is our product better, other

00:22:28.429 --> 00:22:34.450
corporation's products are harming people."
It was about osteoporosis.

00:22:34.450 --> 00:22:38.740
And that's fiction, right? I mean, they may
have such data.

00:22:38.740 --> 00:22:41.659
They may have written that data down five
minutes ago on a napkin.

00:22:41.659 --> 00:22:48.320
I mean, you know, a little bit -- it's like
the Calvin and Hobbes, "They lie; we lie."

00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:52.019
kind of scenario, where there are certain
things you can get across in fiction that

00:22:52.019 --> 00:23:02.409
you can not get across in an essay, I think.
Things like thought patterns.

00:23:02.409 --> 00:23:08.190
I mean, you can interview people extensively
and try and capture that, but to really mock

00:23:08.190 --> 00:23:14.809
up what somebody is thinking in a situation
in realtime?

00:23:14.809 --> 00:23:20.350
I also -- I should say that, although there
are some inaccuracies in the book, there are

00:23:20.350 --> 00:23:24.130
some intentional ones and also, I'm sure,
some unintentional ones.

00:23:24.130 --> 00:23:27.659
There's a lot of facts in there.
I mean, I really do go out of my way to make

00:23:27.659 --> 00:23:31.519
it as accurate as possible.
Sir.

00:23:31.519 --> 00:23:37.019
Q [indecipherable]

00:23:37.019 --> 00:23:47.929
Josh Bazell: Right. Just in case anybody doesn't
know what this is.

00:23:47.929 --> 00:23:52.490
A single payer health care system is one in
which there is no insurance.

00:23:52.490 --> 00:23:55.960
There is no gamble.
You're not putting up money because you think

00:23:55.960 --> 00:24:00.700
something might happen to you.
And they're not taking your money hoping that,

00:24:00.700 --> 00:24:04.510
either nothing happens to you or that they
can deny that something happened to you when

00:24:04.510 --> 00:24:07.870
something happened to you -- or fail to take
responsibility for it.

00:24:07.870 --> 00:24:11.059
Single payer means, The government pays for
health care.

00:24:11.059 --> 00:24:13.790
They are not paying for insurance.
They are paying for actual health care.

00:24:13.790 --> 00:24:18.490
If you go into the hospital, you got a broken
leg, they pay the doctor.

00:24:18.490 --> 00:24:23.440
What we're looking at is some sort of very-watered-down
insurance system.

00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:30.399
I mean, almost by definition -- you know -- these
corporations, that make so very much money,

00:24:30.399 --> 00:24:35.480
are parasitic.
You know, the difference -- these are companies

00:24:35.480 --> 00:24:39.960
 -- the way an insurance company makes money
is by making this gamble with you.

00:24:39.960 --> 00:24:43.390
And then, pushing the issue to try and win
on each case.

00:24:43.390 --> 00:24:47.419
I mean, there's somebody in an office all
the time trying to figure out how to not to

00:24:47.419 --> 00:24:53.090
pay for something that -- let's admit it -- in
some cases is fraudulent, but in most cases

00:24:53.090 --> 00:24:57.769
isn't.
And just the idea that you can take out that

00:24:57.769 --> 00:25:04.200
parasite from the loop, it would be such an
enormous savings -- not only in terms of money,

00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:08.310
but also time.
I mean, dealing with an insurance company

00:25:08.310 --> 00:25:14.940
is absolutely maddening.
And you know like this thing where they four

00:25:14.940 --> 00:25:18.529
times in a row said they didn't get my check
that they had cashed.

00:25:18.529 --> 00:25:21.929
At a certain point you've got to stop thinking
that's incompetence, because never once have

00:25:21.929 --> 00:25:26.600
they said, "Oh, we got two checks from you."
You got to start thinking, "This is somebody

00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:32.090
who's looking at the bottom line and has a
full-time job of figuring out essentially

00:25:32.090 --> 00:25:36.380
how to rip people off."
And it just seems like getting rid of that

00:25:36.380 --> 00:25:42.900
situation is not only theoretically better,
but it works better in other countries.

00:25:42.900 --> 00:25:43.900
Sir.

00:25:43.900 --> 00:25:50.659
Q And actually, if you try to repeat the question
if possible after each.

00:25:50.659 --> 00:25:51.659
Josh Bazell: Oh, sure.

00:25:51.659 --> 00:26:03.710
Q With regards to research on the book, obviously,
the doctor in med school here in the book

00:26:03.710 --> 00:26:07.160
had died [inaudible]-- as far as the Mafia
side, did you term as Shylock at any point,

00:26:07.160 --> 00:26:08.240
or how did you go about? [laughter]

00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:12.600
Josh Bazell: No, I mean, I have a couple of
real world, underworld connections.

00:26:12.600 --> 00:26:18.340
They're very minor.
I grew up in downtown Manhattan in a neighborhood

00:26:18.340 --> 00:26:21.789
where there are a lot of guys who wanted you
to think they were mobsters.

00:26:21.789 --> 00:26:24.929
I don't know if they were.
And the extent to which they were was never

00:26:24.929 --> 00:26:27.460
really clear.
I mean, Vinnie "The Chin" was clearly an actual

00:26:27.460 --> 00:26:29.769
mobster.
He lived about two blocks from me.

00:26:29.769 --> 00:26:34.370
He was this guy who would wear a bathrobe
on the street so that, if he got indicted,

00:26:34.370 --> 00:26:39.150
he could claim that he was crazy.
He wore this bathrobe for my entire childhood

00:26:39.150 --> 00:26:42.120
and then got indicted and it didn't work.
[laughter]

00:26:42.120 --> 00:26:51.360
His actual last name was Gigante.
I additionally used to work for the chief

00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:57.649
medical examiner's office in New York City,
so I've seen some of the crime stuff from

00:26:57.649 --> 00:27:01.779
that angle and I spent a lot of time with
police officers.

00:27:01.779 --> 00:27:10.559
All that said, the real source of my information
is this sub-genre of "Mafia witness protection

00:27:10.559 --> 00:27:15.320
tell all", which is the most disgusting sub-genre
of books I've ever come across.

00:27:15.320 --> 00:27:18.149
There are these books -- and people go into
the witness protection program -- they write

00:27:18.149 --> 00:27:22.100
a book, not least of which because you make
very little money generally in the witness

00:27:22.100 --> 00:27:27.120
protection program, unless -- like Sammy the
Bull -- you're running the biggest ecstasy

00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:31.399
ring in the country or something.
And these books are all about how sorry these

00:27:31.399 --> 00:27:35.220
guys are that they committed these horrible
acts, but they're not really actually sorry

00:27:35.220 --> 00:27:38.169
at all.
They just want to brag about how they used

00:27:38.169 --> 00:27:42.130
to be able to get people beaten up and used
to get good tables at restaurants and stuff.

00:27:42.130 --> 00:27:46.009
And the hypocrisy is just -- you want to take
a shower after you read these books.

00:27:46.009 --> 00:27:52.179
But there's a lot of them.
And I continue to take the hit for the public

00:27:52.179 --> 00:27:57.659
good of reading.
One thing that's really interesting is people

00:27:57.659 --> 00:28:01.720
who have identified themselves to me, after
the book came out, as people with violent

00:28:01.720 --> 00:28:05.880
backgrounds or criminal backgrounds who have
become health care professionals.

00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:14.340
I have never -- I haven't seen a doctor who
used to be a hitman, but I've seen, you know,

00:28:14.340 --> 00:28:17.690
I've seen bank robbers who are now physician's
assistants and stuff.

00:28:17.690 --> 00:28:21.340
And it's really interesting.
And often it's very emotional to talk to them,

00:28:21.340 --> 00:28:25.870
because they tend to be sort of the opposite
of these scum bags in the protection program.

00:28:25.870 --> 00:28:33.100
These are people who really changed their
life, usually from a religious conversion.

00:28:33.100 --> 00:28:34.100
Okay.

00:28:34.100 --> 00:28:37.440
Q You're working on a second book now?

00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:42.040
Josh Bazell: I am working on the second book
now.

00:28:42.040 --> 00:28:43.040
Q Can you disclose that in a similar genre?

00:28:43.040 --> 00:28:46.230
Josh Bazell: Oh yeah. It's actually a sequel.
It's a continuation.

00:28:46.230 --> 00:28:50.690
It's not a sequel in the sense of, "This is
a series character, who's like exactly the

00:28:50.690 --> 00:28:55.410
same in every book," but it does take place
afterwards.

00:28:55.410 --> 00:29:02.559
I mean, it's -- he has taken the damage emotionally
and physically that he has taken in this book

00:29:02.559 --> 00:29:05.899
and that carries forward.
So it's quite a different book, actually.

00:29:05.899 --> 00:29:09.760
But I'm working on it.
Mr. Tsai, Dr. Tsai.

00:29:09.760 --> 00:29:21.570
Q Have you given talks to primarily physician
audiences vs. primarily crime nuar type audiences?

00:29:21.570 --> 00:29:31.340
Josh Bazell: The question is, Do I primarily
give talks to physicians or to readers?

00:29:31.340 --> 00:29:38.070
It's about 50/50.
It does tend to be quite different -- I mean,

00:29:38.070 --> 00:29:43.380
often if I go to a bookstore, I'll actually
read from the book or do some other lame thing

00:29:43.380 --> 00:29:50.220
to sort of expose people to it.
Recently, the difference between the two audiences

00:29:50.220 --> 00:29:54.870
has really become minimal, because everybody's
sort of freaked out about health care.

00:29:54.870 --> 00:30:00.240
Or if they're not freaked out, I sort of make
it my personal business to freak them out.

00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:04.559
[laughter]
Anyway, thank you guys so much for your time.

00:30:04.559 --> 00:30:05.379
Thanks for the interest.
