00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:06.940
[applause]
&gt;&gt; Kristin: Hi Everybody, Hi!

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:07.940
&gt;&gt; Lee Stimmel: Ah this is great.

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:08.940
Thank you for coming.

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:09.940
&gt;&gt; Kristin: Wow.

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:10.940
This is so nice.

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:11.940
I didn't know it would be that, this many
people.

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:13.910
&gt;&gt; Lee Stimmel: Yeah, Well we have been sitting
here anxiously waiting.

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:15.350
We have been listening to some of your music.

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:16.350
[ laughs ]

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:17.350
&gt;&gt; Kristin: Oh you have?

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:19.630
&gt;&gt; Lee: A couple of well videos earlier, but
yes we have been primed and prepped.

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:20.970
&gt;&gt; Kristin: Oh my gosh.

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:21.970
Thank you!

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:26.300
&gt;&gt; Lee: So I understand that you are promoting
a new record, is that right?

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:27.300
Released yesterday.

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.300
&gt;&gt; Kristin: Yeah.

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:29.640
It came out yesterday; it's called Some Lessons
Learned.

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:30.640
And it's about, ah, gosh so..

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:36.230
&gt;&gt; Lee: And I was going to ask you what's
one of the lessons you have learned?

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:37.230
[ laughs ]

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.709
&gt;&gt; Kristin: I mean really, how long do we
have?

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:40.709
[ laughs ]

00:00:40.709 --> 00:00:43.579
&gt;&gt; Lee: I don't know, but aside from the album
what would you think?

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:47.800
&gt;&gt; Kristin: I mean, to me, I mean you guys
are all going to understand this thing is,

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.289
Don't sweat the small stuff.

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:54.050
I guess you guys have to sweat the small stuff
[ laughter ] so that I don't have to.

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:57.010
Um, but that is a big lesson, you know.

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:00.219
You can only do and worry about so much.

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:02.480
&gt;&gt; Lee: That's a good point.

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:08.150
We definitely deal with a lot of, yeah, I
mean, I guess being overwhelmed and just kind

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:09.150
of sorting it out.

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.050
&gt;&gt; Kristin: Do what you can, do your best
and you know, have a drink.

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:13.050
[ laughs ]

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:14.560
&gt;&gt; Lee: That was a good one.

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:16.350
&gt;&gt; Kristin: Of Coke of course.

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.760
&gt;&gt; Lee: Um, so TV, Broadway, Music, almost
everything under the sun.

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:25.130
I was a stage manager in theatre, so they
have triple threat, obviously.

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:29.180
I was trying to come up with a term for someone
who does more than three things.

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:31.730
[Kristin laughs ] You know like you were in-

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:33.530
&gt;&gt; Kristi: Type A
[ laughs ]

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:35.840
&gt;&gt; Lee: Yeah, exactly.

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:41.560
So I guess we have some popular questions
from people here and also people in VC in

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.000
other offices watching.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.520
Um and it's a Google moderated page.

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.380
They vote for the most important ones, so
we can start with one of those [audience laughs]

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:50.770
and take some live questions here.

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:53.390
We have some CDs that we are going to give
away to people that answer some of the questions

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:54.390
and then kind of go from here.

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:55.390
&gt;&gt; Kristin: Ah, that's great, I’m very happy.

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:56.390
&gt;&gt; Lee: I'm gonna get the live; I'm gonna
get the live.

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:59.140
I am trying to be very high tech, I've got
a tablet.

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:00.420
&gt;&gt; Kristin: What is that?

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:01.940
&gt;&gt; Lee: It's a tablet.

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:04.090
&gt;&gt; Kristin: Y'all probably invented it.

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:06.790
&gt;&gt;Lee: Yeah, wish I had the patent on it.

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:08.789
That would be great.

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:09.789
[ laughs ]

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:11.290
&gt;&gt; Kristin: You're right
[ laughter ]

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:15.230
&gt;&gt; Lee: One of the top questions was um, I
am sure you get this a lot; I adored Pushing

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.650
Daisies and was the saddest when it was canceled.

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:23.160
Are there any plans to work on a sequel project,
movie, TV special etc.?

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.500
If there are would you appear as Olive again?

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.950
&gt;&gt; Kristin: I would have to be dumb not to.

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:33.780
I mean, Brian Fuller, I always say doesn't
your head hurt from the information that is

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:34.780
in your head.

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:39.410
Much like I would say to any of you all but
I mean [ laughter ] he is so smart.

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:41.800
He created this world.

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:45.170
I knew when I read the pilot that it was going
to be something special.

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:51.800
Um, I knew where Olive could go and there's
talk of doing a movie.

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:56.640
So maybe if we all write in how much we want
him to do that.

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:01.540
[ laughter ] I know he is writing and has
been doing a comic for a Marvel Comics.

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:06.180
I like the way I look in the cartoon version
[ laughter ] I certainly sound like a cartoon

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.390
so it is like perfect.

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:09.960
I would love to play Olive Snook.

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:15.250
That's like one of my biggest, not regrets,
but like the itch that I can't scratch is

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:17.420
the ending to that show.

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:24.460
The closure and obviously I know what makes
a hit because I thought it was the most genius

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:25.460
thing I have ever seen.

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:27.200
And not just because I was in it.

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:28.200
I just loved it.

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:29.470
&gt;&gt; Lee: It was great,

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:30.840
&gt;&gt; Kristin: And the cast.

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:35.970
Lee Pace, Anna Friel, Swoosie , Ellen, Chi
– so good, so good.

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:39.930
&gt;&gt; Lee: I was catching up on a couple of episodes
from the second half of the second season

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:41.060
and I forgot how much I enjoyed it.

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:44.000
&gt;&gt; Kristin: Did you see the pig that I worked
with, Pigbee?

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.010
Or Digbee the dog.

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:46.010
&gt;&gt; Lee: Digbee yes.

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:48.050
&gt;&gt; Kristin: I had to work with all animals
and children.

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:49.050
That is so not fair.

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:50.050
[ laughter ]

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:51.050
&gt;&gt; Lee: Oh.

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:52.050
I almost brought my dog today.

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:53.090
&gt;&gt; Kristin: Oh I wish you would have, but
I love dogs.

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:55.390
What kind do you have?

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:56.390
[ laughter ]

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:58.819
&gt;&gt; Lee: Because we are not interviewing me..

00:03:58.819 --> 00:03:59.819
&gt;&gt; Kristin: Who cares, who cares?

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:01.849
[audience laughs]
&gt;&gt; Lee: She is a Welsh Corgi.

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:04.300
&gt;&gt; Kristin: Isn't that what the Queen has?

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:05.380
[audience laughs]
&gt;&gt; Lee: Probably.

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:06.720
&gt;&gt; Kristin: They are so cute.

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:09.190
&gt;&gt; Lee: Do you sing for the Queen?

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:10.420
&gt;&gt; Kristin: Yes I did

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:15.030
&gt;&gt; Lee: OK, cuz I was watching The View yesterday,
[ laughter ] I actually watched it this morning

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:18.879
[applause and laughter]
&gt;&gt; Kristin: Say it loud and say it proud!

00:04:18.879 --> 00:04:22.480
&gt;&gt; Lee: I say like, Whoopi Goldberg is good
at this and I'm not because I have always

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:23.480
been behind the scenes.

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:25.100
So I am going to go steal her questions.

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:26.930
And that was one of the questions I was going
to steal.

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:29.410
&gt;&gt; Kristin: You are so cute, it doesn’t
matter.

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:31.090
&gt;&gt; Lee: Ahh, this is rough, this is hard.

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:32.090
I am going to go back to the Dory questions.

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:33.090
&gt;&gt; Kristin: Where are you from?

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:35.010
&gt;&gt; Lee: I am originally from North Carolina.

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:37.180
&gt;&gt; Kristin: Oh you are, the basketball.

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:38.220
&gt;&gt; Lee: No, ahh.

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:41.310
Well it was basketball but I never played
any sports.

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:43.550
&gt;&gt; Kristin: Did they have a professional football
team?

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:45.500
&gt;&gt; Lee: They do now, I think it is like the
Panthers in Charlotte.

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:46.600
&gt;&gt; Kristin: Never heard of them.

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:48.330
&gt;&gt; Lee: Yeah, they weren't around when I was
growing up.

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:53.620
[ laughs ]
[ laughter ] I am going to do back to the

00:04:53.620 --> 00:05:02.520
Dory cause that is easy.

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:03.520
&gt;&gt; Kristin: You're so cute.

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:04.520
Are you single?

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:05.520
[ laughter and applause]

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:06.520
&gt;&gt; Lee: Ahh.. you are not making this any
easier.

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:07.520
&gt;&gt; Kristin: I'm sorry! [ laughs ]

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:08.520
&gt;&gt; Lee: Alright, this is a good one.

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:09.520
&gt;&gt; Kristin: [ sings ] I can dream, can't I?

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:16.199
It's the end of my day, I am letting it loose
for you guys.

00:05:16.199 --> 00:05:20.300
[ laughs ] Lee, Lee, Lee

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:24.420
&gt;&gt; Lee: Now your costar on Pushing Daisies
is also named Lee also.

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:28.120
&gt;&gt; Kristin: Lee Pace, who I love, who is about
seven feet tall.

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:29.860
I'm glad you brought him up.

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:32.440
I wanted to give a shout out to him and his
family.

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:36.220
They have just recently lost their farm in
Texas to the fires.

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:38.909
So, you know, I am sure he is dealing with
that.

00:05:38.909 --> 00:05:41.260
I just love him, I think he is an amazing
actor.

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:44.030
More than anything though I think he is a
good person.

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:46.699
I just love him, I would be like, "We're running
behind.

00:05:46.699 --> 00:05:49.280
I have been here like fourteen hours, I can't."

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:54.090
And he was like Buddha, Zen, calm.

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:58.300
He never, he was just that person, and I needed
it, so.

00:05:58.300 --> 00:05:59.300
[ laughs ]

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:03.680
&gt;&gt; Lee: Another one of the top voted questions
was, since you do performing with Broadway

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:08.700
and TV shows, what are the main differences
for you as an actor and a singer?

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:16.740
&gt;&gt; Kristin: Well you know when you are doing
a Broadway show you get to hide behind or

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:18.740
in a character, which I loved.

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:20.461
[ background noise… rustling ] Um, it's
hard to just be.

00:06:20.461 --> 00:06:21.461
I love that noise, it's amazing.

00:06:21.461 --> 00:06:28.270
[ laughs ] [ noise continues ] I am just kidding,
you need to do your job, too, sir.

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:37.060
Um, I get to hide in a character and I love
that because, um, it's an opportunity to bring

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:40.169
an original [ noise continues ] piece of work
or a revival.

00:06:40.169 --> 00:06:46.080
[ noise ] Playing to the back of the house
is the challenge, eight times a week.

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:48.090
Broadway is not for wimps; it's not for wimps.

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:53.130
But when you are doing TV and film you know
your performing [background noise continues

00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:55.570
] for an audience this big or depending what
size TV.

00:06:55.570 --> 00:06:56.690
Y'all probably have like; see?

00:06:56.690 --> 00:06:57.920
there it is.

00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:00.380
That's probably the size of TV you have.

00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:05.390
[Lee chuckles]
So it is a smaller thing so you might have

00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:07.870
to dial it in a little bit, it feels a little
bit more intimate to me.

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:14.009
But really to me if I am on a concert stage
in front of an orchestra, or if I'm in a dive

00:07:14.009 --> 00:07:17.340
bar signing, or if I'm doing a film.

00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:22.740
If I'm staying true to myself and the character,
even if the person is I'm just presenting

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:26.080
myself, um, in front of people.

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:30.350
Then I just want to always be true to that.

00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:36.320
So it kind of, I kind of feel like I can't
miss, I might not be everyone's favorite,

00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:43.449
but if I am true than whether it is film,
TV, theatre or concert it doesn't really matter.

00:07:43.449 --> 00:07:46.230
To me it is all the same, it's an extension
of me.

00:07:46.230 --> 00:07:49.240
&gt;&gt; Lee: It's that form of communication…that's
all right, we will real that in.

00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:50.240
&gt;&gt; Kristin: See, welcome to my world.

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:54.100
I want you all to invent a way I can have
a microphone implanted in my body.

00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:55.650
&gt;&gt; Lee: That's a great idea
[ laughter ]

00:07:55.650 --> 00:07:58.040
&gt;&gt; Kristin: And you could get to patent on
that! [ laughter ]

00:07:58.040 --> 00:08:02.080
&gt;&gt; Lee: I will get the engineers together
and we will start working on that.

00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:03.080
&gt;&gt; Kristin: Come on guys,

00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:05.500
&gt;&gt; Lee: Yeah, implants in the head, that's
a huge market opportunity to be in.

00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:06.500
For lots, for more than just microphones.

00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:08.220
&gt;&gt; Kristin: I would buy that sucker.

00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:10.930
&gt;&gt; : Lee: If I could not type anymore, that
would be awesome.

00:08:10.930 --> 00:08:14.620
&gt;&gt; Kristin: Do you guys, are your fingers
tired, do your arms get sore?

00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:15.770
&gt;&gt; Lee: Yeah, Yeah
[ laughter ]

00:08:15.770 --> 00:08:19.020
&gt;&gt; Kristin: I bet, I bet
[audience laughs]

00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:23.180
&gt;&gt; Male: Are you going to come back to Broadway
anytime soon?

00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:26.410
Are there any plans for any shows coming up?

00:08:26.410 --> 00:08:27.410
Yeah

00:08:27.410 --> 00:08:29.139
&gt;&gt; Kristin: Yeah, [ applause ] Thank you.

00:08:29.139 --> 00:08:35.229
I really want, well I am going to revive a
show called On The Twentieth Century.

00:08:35.229 --> 00:08:37.159
It hasn’t been done in thirty years.

00:08:37.159 --> 00:08:42.450
The woman that created the role Lily Garland
was Madeline Kahn, who my dog is named after.

00:08:42.450 --> 00:08:45.440
She is one of my favorite actresses and singers
that ever lived.

00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:46.620
[ applause ] Thank you, I love her too.

00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:48.060
She is my favorite.

00:08:48.060 --> 00:08:54.680
Um, so I will look forward to that because
it is operatic in nature but it is a comedy.

00:08:54.680 --> 00:09:01.019
[ burps ] That's what happens when you have
a Coke.

00:09:01.019 --> 00:09:03.750
[ laughter ]
And there, my record sales just went down.

00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:07.760
Anyway, that's the most balls I have ever
had in my voice right there.

00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:10.250
Anyway, um, wow, my mom is so proud right
now.

00:09:10.250 --> 00:09:16.760
[ laughter ] But I also am working on a show
that I will do too.

00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:21.330
The first thing will be On The Twentieth Century
and then the second is the sort of life story

00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:22.880
of Tammy Faye Bakker.

00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:29.730
I don't know if any of you remember her but
she was a really well known televangelist

00:09:29.730 --> 00:09:37.050
wife and she was on television as well as
a very unique, funny, interesting woman and

00:09:37.050 --> 00:09:38.050
character.

00:09:38.050 --> 00:09:43.050
So Henry Krieger who composed Dream Girls
is composing that, we did our first reading

00:09:43.050 --> 00:09:44.050
not long ago.

00:09:44.050 --> 00:09:48.300
It's amazing music, but I look forward to
coming back to Broadway anytime they will

00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:49.300
have me.

00:09:49.300 --> 00:09:50.300
&gt;&gt; Lee: Excellent, excellent, um, yeah.

00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:51.300
We have a lot of questions.

00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:56.250
I want to hear your thoughts briefly on, um,
Steel Pier as well actually cause I did the

00:09:56.250 --> 00:09:59.180
tour after I left Broadway briefly in 2001.

00:09:59.180 --> 00:10:00.180
&gt;&gt; Kristin: What?

00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:01.180
Did you have a part?

00:10:01.180 --> 00:10:02.180
Don't tell me who?

00:10:02.180 --> 00:10:03.180
&gt;&gt; Lee: No, I was a stage manager.

00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:04.180
No, I never performed a day in my life.

00:10:04.180 --> 00:10:07.190
This is actually the fourth time I have ever
been in front of a camera.

00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:08.190
&gt;&gt; Kristin: What?

00:10:08.190 --> 00:10:13.550
You should always be in front of a camera.

00:10:13.550 --> 00:10:14.550
[ laughs]

00:10:14.550 --> 00:10:15.600
&gt;&gt; Lee: I'll pass, I'll pass.

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:17.310
&gt;&gt; Kristin: OK, yeah, Steel Pier.

00:10:17.310 --> 00:10:18.330
I loved it.

00:10:18.330 --> 00:10:20.610
&gt;&gt; Male audience member #1: Thanks for being
here.

00:10:20.610 --> 00:10:24.300
Could you please tell us about your most embarrassing
moment on stage?

00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:26.929
&gt;&gt; Kristin: It just happened.

00:10:26.929 --> 00:10:28.899
[ laughs ] that burp.

00:10:28.899 --> 00:10:30.870
Um, let's see.

00:10:30.870 --> 00:10:39.450
There was a show I did at the Guthrie Theatre
in Minneapolis called Babes in Arms.

00:10:39.450 --> 00:10:43.410
It was gonna come to Broadway but it ultimately
didn't get there.

00:10:43.410 --> 00:10:52.440
I had a job of tap dancing down a big stairway
of piano keys.

00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:57.890
Sing and dance this song, be a part of this
number called Keys to Heaven.

00:10:57.890 --> 00:11:02.600
And I had a big time quick change right before
the number where I had to change my wig in

00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:03.950
like fourteen seconds.

00:11:03.950 --> 00:11:09.550
And I had just did my own wig every night
with just two pins cause then I would change

00:11:09.550 --> 00:11:11.700
again and put my normal wig back on.

00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:17.550
And um, I was sort of dressed like a Carmen
Miranda type character and I remember I was

00:11:17.550 --> 00:11:18.550
doing the big [short pause].

00:11:18.550 --> 00:11:21.990
And I felt like something might have come
off my hair or something and I was like, oh

00:11:21.990 --> 00:11:23.420
well, [ sings ] Keys to Heaven.

00:11:23.420 --> 00:11:29.940
And I am looking out and there is like people
going [ gasps and covers mouth making noise

00:11:29.940 --> 00:11:32.959
] and this is what I see.

00:11:32.959 --> 00:11:36.050
[ laughter ] and I realize my wig is on the
floor.

00:11:36.050 --> 00:11:38.430
Bald cap, microphone, this.

00:11:38.430 --> 00:11:40.220
just dancing away.

00:11:40.220 --> 00:11:47.190
You know, um, I finished the number completely
bald and then put the wig back on my head

00:11:47.190 --> 00:11:48.649
when it was over.

00:11:48.649 --> 00:11:50.870
It was embarrassing and then three weeks later
I am doing the same show.

00:11:50.870 --> 00:11:53.890
And like at Act II there is this thing that
enters, it's like a bomb.

00:11:53.890 --> 00:11:58.540
This thing that comes out of the audience
and I am waiting at intermissions.

00:11:58.540 --> 00:12:01.640
I can sometimes here the people talk before
I enter because of intermission.

00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:06.940
And I hear, this honest to goodness, this
is like three weeks later, "and then her wig

00:12:06.940 --> 00:12:07.940
fell off and she kept dancing."

00:12:07.940 --> 00:12:13.390
I was like, oh, they are talking about me.

00:12:13.390 --> 00:12:15.399
Anyway it was like a p.s. to the most horrifying
moment.

00:12:15.399 --> 00:12:16.809
&gt;&gt; Male audience member #1: Thank you

00:12:16.809 --> 00:12:18.030
&gt;&gt; Lee: Do you want a CD?

00:12:18.030 --> 00:12:21.270
&gt;&gt; Kristin: Oh good, I hope you like it.

00:12:21.270 --> 00:12:22.560
Thank you.

00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:29.040
I love the Dave Matthews Band too, aren't
they amazing?

00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:30.040
[ laughs ]

00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:31.650
&gt;&gt; Female #1: Thank you for coming.

00:12:31.650 --> 00:12:36.730
My husband actually met you, gosh, after you
did Charlie Brown you went to see the first

00:12:36.730 --> 00:12:40.060
regional production of Charlie Brown after
you closed and you sat down with the cast

00:12:40.060 --> 00:12:41.449
and my husband was Charlie Brown.

00:12:41.449 --> 00:12:42.449
&gt;&gt; Kristin: What?

00:12:42.449 --> 00:12:44.830
I remember it, I remember that.

00:12:44.830 --> 00:12:46.670
&gt;&gt; Female #1: So I am here for him and for
me.

00:12:46.670 --> 00:12:47.670
&gt;&gt; Kristin: Well you tell him hi-

00:12:47.670 --> 00:12:51.050
&gt;&gt; Female #1: I will, I'll say "Bob, Kristin
said HI!"

00:12:51.050 --> 00:12:55.069
&gt;&gt; Kristin: hi and that's the only production
I have ever seen of Charlie Brown.

00:12:55.069 --> 00:12:57.380
&gt;&gt; Female #1: Aww, he will be thrilled.

00:12:57.380 --> 00:13:02.180
First of all we love Glee at my house and
thank you for being in it.

00:13:02.180 --> 00:13:06.600
A couple of years ago we took my mother-in-law
to the concert as a surprise at Radio City.

00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:11.040
You weren't there but they were playing the
sound track and a ten year old behind me said

00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:17.649
"Oh my God, I love this song so much!" and
it was you singing One Less Bell to Answer.

00:13:17.649 --> 00:13:18.649
&gt;&gt; Kristin: Are you kidding me?

00:13:18.649 --> 00:13:22.760
&gt;&gt; Female #1: And what struck me in 2009 when
that happened was a ten year old was thrilled

00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:25.650
to hear you sign Burt Bacharach and so I wanted
to ask you.

00:13:25.650 --> 00:13:27.360
It's amazing to me, but,

00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:29.700
&gt;&gt; Kristin: It is amazing to me too.

00:13:29.700 --> 00:13:31.310
I am serious, I'm serious.

00:13:31.310 --> 00:13:33.700
That he would know that music..

00:13:33.700 --> 00:13:35.490
&gt;&gt; Female #1: You brought that music back.

00:13:35.490 --> 00:13:39.820
So I wondered who would you like the current
generation of tweens to hear?

00:13:39.820 --> 00:13:43.720
Either through Glee or what music could we
bring back that they need to hear?

00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:46.310
&gt;&gt; Kristin: Ah,, that's a great question.

00:13:46.310 --> 00:13:52.480
You know I, too, love the fact that Glee has
brought, you know in one episode, in the first

00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:57.700
episode I did, I did "Maybe This Time" from
Cabaret.

00:13:57.700 --> 00:14:00.209
I did a Carrie Underwood song called "Last
Name".

00:14:00.209 --> 00:14:06.000
And I did a seventies rock, Heart is the group,
I did "Alone".

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:10.930
And Ryan Murphy, like those three songs completely
different, he has done such a good job at

00:14:10.930 --> 00:14:12.980
bringing all different kinds of music to this
show.

00:14:12.980 --> 00:14:17.880
Which is why it's struck such a cord and why
it makes me happy that a nine year old kid

00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:19.820
go "I love this song!"

00:14:19.820 --> 00:14:24.600
Um, I would love to see, you know, a resurgence
of the thirties.

00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:31.000
I mean, in the thirties and forties music,
that was actually my first record I ever made

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:32.330
was that kind of music.

00:14:32.330 --> 00:14:40.350
Gershwin, Rodgers and Hart, um, you know we
have wonderful composer today but there is

00:14:40.350 --> 00:14:44.820
a sense of innocence, that time that we can
revisit.

00:14:44.820 --> 00:14:48.399
And to make it current again would be amazing.

00:14:48.399 --> 00:14:54.720
But when I think of even you know Cole Porter,
oh gosh, there is too many to mention.

00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:56.700
That is probably my favorite era.

00:14:56.700 --> 00:15:00.890
I would love to see that come back more.

00:15:00.890 --> 00:15:03.120
&gt;&gt; Lee: That's a good question.

00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:06.460
So you also won a Tony for "Good Man Charlie
Brown".

00:15:06.460 --> 00:15:08.260
So I have got to put that in there.

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:09.260
[ laughs ]

00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:10.260
&gt;&gt; Kristin: Thank you

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:11.700
&gt;&gt; Lee: And um, I guess it is kind of a follow
up question for, on the Glee side of things.

00:15:11.700 --> 00:15:12.700
Were you ever in show choir?

00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:14.140
How did you get your start?

00:15:14.140 --> 00:15:15.140
Was--

00:15:15.140 --> 00:15:16.440
&gt;&gt; Kristin: Well my start was in Church.

00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:22.370
I grew up in Broken Arrow, Oklahoma and our
only outlet of performance was either that

00:15:22.370 --> 00:15:23.370
or cheerleading.

00:15:23.370 --> 00:15:28.940
Which I did cause I was like, I can perform,
but I faked the yelling.

00:15:28.940 --> 00:15:33.180
I was a flyer, which is why I smashed my cooter
[ laughs ] I know people have heard this.

00:15:33.180 --> 00:15:37.100
I broke my coccyx cause I was on the top and
somebody got tired and let me down.

00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:42.089
I was in the splits and I was like [ crushing
noise ] with my coccyx, I call it the cooter

00:15:42.089 --> 00:15:43.089
smash.

00:15:43.089 --> 00:15:49.120
But anyway, yeah, the funny thing with me
and cheerleading was I faked yelling cause

00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:51.820
I didn't want to hurt my voice.

00:15:51.820 --> 00:15:54.890
I would be like [ pause ] I did it.

00:15:54.890 --> 00:15:58.402
This one girl, who will remain nameless, was
like "You're faking it!" and I was like "I

00:15:58.402 --> 00:15:59.470
know I am!"

00:15:59.470 --> 00:16:06.020
But we didn't have show choir but what we
did have, which has made me even as nerdy

00:16:06.020 --> 00:16:12.019
as you can get, we had Madrigals.

00:16:12.019 --> 00:16:14.470
[ laughs ] Yes, and of course I was the leader
of the madrigals.

00:16:14.470 --> 00:16:18.880
I loved madrigals cause you had to audition
and of course it was like me, auditioning,

00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:20.519
no body else.

00:16:20.519 --> 00:16:22.480
But that holds a special place in my heart.

00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:28.360
I was a big fan of the King Singers, this
madrigal group and, um, yeah, so I was in

00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:34.070
madrigals, I did the choirs concerts, I did
the drama club, and I was a silent cheerleader

00:16:34.070 --> 00:16:37.550
[ laughs ] and I sang at rodeos.

00:16:37.550 --> 00:16:42.670
I sang at anything I could because that was
the only outlet I had.

00:16:42.670 --> 00:16:46.260
&gt;&gt; Lee: Well you certainly had a great career
ever since then.

00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:51.029
And I also heard that ABC picked up a show
called "Good Christian Belles" is coming out

00:16:51.029 --> 00:16:52.029
as well.

00:16:52.029 --> 00:16:53.029
&gt;&gt; Kristin: Yeah, Good Christian Belles

00:16:53.029 --> 00:16:55.680
&gt;&gt; Lee: I caught a little tidbit online and
I know now necessarily you are not supposed

00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:59.079
to believe everything you read, or see online,
although someone did mention to me that you

00:16:59.079 --> 00:17:00.560
said you gotta sing from your cooter.

00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:04.250
Now that we are on the subject, is that true
and how does that work?

00:17:04.250 --> 00:17:07.039
I'm asking too many questions, umm.

00:17:07.039 --> 00:17:10.769
&gt;&gt; Kristin: I can tell you later, Lee!
[ laughter ]

00:17:10.769 --> 00:17:15.480
&gt;&gt; Lee: Um so I heard, um, yeah, I am going
to a completely different subject.

00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:19.609
So the ABC show had a different name of the
pilot, is that true?

00:17:19.609 --> 00:17:21.159
&gt;&gt; Kristin: Yeah, Good Christian rhymes with
witches.

00:17:21.159 --> 00:17:22.159
&gt;&gt; Lee: Um, OHH

00:17:22.159 --> 00:17:28.179
&gt;&gt; Kristin: But it was based on a book that
Kim Gatlin wrote out of Dallas, a wonderful

00:17:28.179 --> 00:17:29.249
writer, very funny.

00:17:29.249 --> 00:17:35.230
It was basically her experience about getting
divorced and moving back from a big city to

00:17:35.230 --> 00:17:40.399
Dallas and what she went through with the
girls that she grew up with and how they accepted

00:17:40.399 --> 00:17:41.399
her.

00:17:41.399 --> 00:17:47.679
It is really less about religion and more
about relationships, which is very fun.

00:17:47.679 --> 00:17:52.510
It's funny, I would never do anything that
made fun of anyone's religion.

00:17:52.510 --> 00:17:57.210
So um, there is a difference in making fun
of and having fun with and I think that's

00:17:57.210 --> 00:17:58.330
what he did so well.

00:17:58.330 --> 00:18:02.160
Bobby Harling, who wrote Steele Magnolias
and certainly knows how to write women, wrote

00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:03.160
it.

00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:08.250
We have Annie Potts, Jennifer Aspen, Marisol
Nichols, Leslie Bibb and Miriam Shor, some

00:18:08.250 --> 00:18:11.039
of you may know from Hedwig here in New York.

00:18:11.039 --> 00:18:13.570
I must say, I am really proud of it.

00:18:13.570 --> 00:18:20.299
We are in the middle of shooting right now
so I've taken just one week off to talk about

00:18:20.299 --> 00:18:22.609
my record and I'll go on tour when we wrap.

00:18:22.609 --> 00:18:25.809
But we are doing ten episodes then we will
get our air date soon.

00:18:25.809 --> 00:18:29.280
&gt;&gt;Lee: I don't see how you do it all, first
of all.

00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:30.280
&gt;&gt; Kristin: I have no life.

00:18:30.280 --> 00:18:32.249
&gt;&gt; Lee: I had a question; "What do you do
with your free time?"

00:18:32.249 --> 00:18:34.079
I was like, scratch that off the list.

00:18:34.079 --> 00:18:39.839
&gt;&gt; Kristin: Here is what I do; Hillbilly Handfishing,
Dance Moms, Real Housewives of New Jersey,

00:18:39.839 --> 00:18:46.480
I mean it's mindless because sometimes I just
need to just turn off my brain.

00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:49.260
You guys understand this, you just need to
turn off your brain sometimes, so what better

00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:50.460
way than reality TV.

00:18:50.460 --> 00:18:53.609
[laughter]
&gt;&gt; Lee: Those really seem to do the trick.

00:18:53.609 --> 00:18:55.049
&gt;&gt; Kristin: [ laughs ] No kidding.

00:18:55.049 --> 00:18:58.360
&gt;&gt; Lee: Well I guess we can go to another
live question, and give another CD here.

00:18:58.360 --> 00:19:02.179
&gt;&gt; Male #2: Ah, So clearly so much for your
art has to do with music and singing, right,

00:19:02.179 --> 00:19:04.890
with all of your Broadway and your record
and everything.

00:19:04.890 --> 00:19:09.650
And then you did this very sort of straight
role, comedic, but on a drama on the West

00:19:09.650 --> 00:19:11.840
Wing, right, so what was it like doing that?

00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:13.169
What made you decide you wanted to do that?

00:19:13.169 --> 00:19:15.519
&gt;&gt;Kristin: Um, Thank you for asking that question.

00:19:15.519 --> 00:19:21.570
I loved the West Wing but I had been offered
this show and then I had been offered Wicked

00:19:21.570 --> 00:19:25.429
so I had to decide which one I was going to
do and I took Wicked.

00:19:25.429 --> 00:19:28.679
[ applause and cheers ]
&gt;&gt;Lee: Thank-you

00:19:28.679 --> 00:19:32.559
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Kristin: And I think it might have been

00:19:32.559 --> 00:19:33.570
the right decision.

00:19:33.570 --> 00:19:39.059
And then Aaron Sorkin, the creator of West
Wing, had left the show and John Wells took

00:19:39.059 --> 00:19:43.559
over, another amazing show runner and writer,
creator in his own right.

00:19:43.559 --> 00:19:49.639
He had asked me to come on as Annabeth Schott,
and Annabeth was the Deputy Press Secretary

00:19:49.639 --> 00:19:51.029
getting into everybody.

00:19:51.029 --> 00:19:57.779
First in line Richard Schiff's character 'Toby'
to become, first in line to become Press Secretary

00:19:57.779 --> 00:20:02.480
when Allison Janney's character stepped into
a new part.

00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:06.889
And I was really nervous because I am not
really political, like I should never talk

00:20:06.889 --> 00:20:13.049
politics because I would live with my foot
would just be hanging out of my mouth.

00:20:13.049 --> 00:20:15.009
But I learned a lot.

00:20:15.009 --> 00:20:21.879
I learned a lot about different countries
and how they did things.

00:20:21.879 --> 00:20:25.119
Martin Sheen is, gosh, he taught me a lot.

00:20:25.119 --> 00:20:29.440
Everybody on that show was so knowledgeable
in this particular area and I can see why

00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:32.149
because you kind of have to get there because
you are talking about it so much.

00:20:32.149 --> 00:20:37.799
I would get these monologues about Uzbekistan,
this long, and I would be like "Is that by

00:20:37.799 --> 00:20:39.409
Prada, Prada, is that a leather?"

00:20:39.409 --> 00:20:41.909
[laughter]
Anyway but I learned.

00:20:41.909 --> 00:20:47.999
My point is I learned so much and I grew a
lot as an artist.

00:20:47.999 --> 00:20:54.320
Precisely why I took the part, is what you
said, I wanted to do something in a world

00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:56.159
that people might not put me in.

00:20:56.159 --> 00:21:00.759
And it worked out, I was supposed to do three
episodes and I did two seasons.

00:21:00.759 --> 00:21:03.789
So, I loved it, I loved it.

00:21:03.789 --> 00:21:04.789
Thank you.

00:21:04.789 --> 00:21:06.390
&gt;&gt; Lee: Here's your CD.

00:21:06.390 --> 00:21:07.499
Also there is two..

00:21:07.499 --> 00:21:08.499
&gt;&gt; Kristin: Nice to meet you.

00:21:08.499 --> 00:21:09.499
&gt;&gt; Lee: two questions.

00:21:09.499 --> 00:21:14.134
We are going to save the last CD for you,
young lady, but one second and we will come

00:21:14.134 --> 00:21:15.134
back to you.

00:21:15.134 --> 00:21:19.239
Theirs is two questions in the Dory are kind
of related.

00:21:19.239 --> 00:21:23.789
One of them is; Was there ever a point in
your career where you almost, or you felt

00:21:23.789 --> 00:21:27.919
like you almost gave up, or you were just
having a tough time?

00:21:27.919 --> 00:21:33.149
And the other related question is; What advice
would you give to aspiring actors?

00:21:33.149 --> 00:21:35.079
&gt;&gt; Kristin: Well it is related.

00:21:35.079 --> 00:21:36.079
&gt;&gt; Lee: Or artist.

00:21:36.079 --> 00:21:39.710
&gt;&gt; Kristin: I am going to answer the second
half first.

00:21:39.710 --> 00:21:43.529
I've heard, I have said this many times, people
have heard me answer this question before

00:21:43.529 --> 00:21:50.349
and I never have to think about it because
I know what the answer is.

00:21:50.349 --> 00:21:56.609
This life, career, is so rewarding but if
you can see yourself doing anything else and

00:21:56.609 --> 00:21:59.820
being happy then you should do it.

00:21:59.820 --> 00:22:03.289
Because this, this can be hard.

00:22:03.289 --> 00:22:08.119
There is a lot of sacrifice and a lot of challenge
and you are selling yourself.

00:22:08.119 --> 00:22:12.749
It is very hard not to take things personally,
no matter what level you are you get constant

00:22:12.749 --> 00:22:14.249
rejection, it doesn't matter.

00:22:14.249 --> 00:22:18.759
I was sitting in an audition many years ago
and a very famous academy award winner was

00:22:18.759 --> 00:22:21.190
sitting next to me and she was auditioning
for the mother part.

00:22:21.190 --> 00:22:25.539
And I said; "Why are you here?" and I think
you have and Academy A-- I worship you!" and

00:22:25.539 --> 00:22:26.830
she goes "I'm here to audition."

00:22:26.830 --> 00:22:32.359
Just because you get an award doesn't mean
it's over.

00:22:32.359 --> 00:22:39.350
In a way it's more risk involved, you know,
microscope is really there.

00:22:39.350 --> 00:22:45.970
So that being said, if you can't see yourself
doing anything else and being happy then you

00:22:45.970 --> 00:22:48.220
should go for it.

00:22:48.220 --> 00:22:56.039
Because it is the greatest gift to be able
to do what you love and I know because I get

00:22:56.039 --> 00:22:58.409
to do what I love.

00:22:58.409 --> 00:23:03.900
And, um, not everybody can say that and I
am very lucky.

00:23:03.900 --> 00:23:12.070
And it has been hard, there have been times
where I have been [pause] low, I get depressed,

00:23:12.070 --> 00:23:15.849
there is this perception about me that I am
happy all the time.

00:23:15.849 --> 00:23:19.359
I wake up "I'm going to get ready now!

00:23:19.359 --> 00:23:22.879
I'm going to put on my shoes!"
[laughter]

00:23:22.879 --> 00:23:29.210
Umm you know, they say that comedians are
actually very tortured people.

00:23:29.210 --> 00:23:33.580
[giggles] That comedy comes through drama,
it's just sped up.

00:23:33.580 --> 00:23:39.929
Um, and I can understand that, but am I basically
a happy person, Yes.

00:23:39.929 --> 00:23:43.599
I have a lot to be thankful for.

00:23:43.599 --> 00:23:46.080
I have a healthy family.

00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:47.429
I have an awesome pet that I love so much.

00:23:47.429 --> 00:24:01.629
I have great friends, my mom and dad love
m;, they gave me the gift of self esteem.

00:24:01.629 --> 00:24:07.899
And I love it; I love it, but it is hard,
it's hard.

00:24:07.899 --> 00:24:09.439
&gt;&gt; Lee: sounds like good words to live by

00:24:09.439 --> 00:24:10.509
&gt;&gt; Kristin: It is right?

00:24:10.509 --> 00:24:13.360
&gt;&gt; Lee: Someone gave me similar advice, don't
write a song unless you have to.

00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:14.360
&gt;&gt; Kristin: That's great!

00:24:14.360 --> 00:24:16.169
&gt;&gt; Lee: You have to have that passion behind
it and it's

00:24:16.169 --> 00:24:17.169
&gt;&gt; Kristin: Yeah, you do!

00:24:17.169 --> 00:24:18.169
If you have something to say, say it!

00:24:18.169 --> 00:24:22.009
&gt;&gt; Lee: Do you want to go for another live
question?

00:24:22.009 --> 00:24:28.639
&gt;&gt; Female #2: Do you have any advice for people
looking to get into theatre?

00:24:28.639 --> 00:24:34.820
&gt;&gt; Kristin: Well I definitely say, when I
was nineteen before I went to OCU.

00:24:34.820 --> 00:24:38.610
I went to Oklahoma City University for music.

00:24:38.610 --> 00:24:43.500
My father, I had auditioned for Opryland for
the summer.

00:24:43.500 --> 00:24:47.259
I love Opryland, they have put out a mall,
which I love malls, but I am really mad at

00:24:47.259 --> 00:24:55.629
that mall because it took the best music place
in the world to me.

00:24:55.629 --> 00:25:02.049
Um, I auditioned, got into a show called 'Way
Out West' and then I had to go back to school.

00:25:02.049 --> 00:25:04.029
And my dad said "You are going to go back
to school."

00:25:04.029 --> 00:25:07.750
And I was like "NO, I was going to, I'm actually
going to stay in Nashville, I'm going to work

00:25:07.750 --> 00:25:09.610
in Opryland for the rest of my life."

00:25:09.610 --> 00:25:11.789
And he says "No, you're going to go."

00:25:11.789 --> 00:25:16.080
And I said "That's sweet of you, but thank
you [ laughs ] I am going to go ahead and

00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:17.080
stay here."

00:25:17.080 --> 00:25:19.119
And he's like "I'm coming to get you now."

00:25:19.119 --> 00:25:20.119
And took me back.

00:25:20.119 --> 00:25:22.429
And thought I went kicking and screaming.

00:25:22.429 --> 00:25:26.019
I am so thankful that I had my education,
that I had a higher education.

00:25:26.019 --> 00:25:31.219
It gave me an opportunity to hone my craft,
which I still work on.

00:25:31.219 --> 00:25:38.379
It gave me an opportunity to experience a
little bit of life on my own without the roof,

00:25:38.379 --> 00:25:41.059
of being under the roof of my parents.

00:25:41.059 --> 00:25:45.340
It gave me opportunities to screw up and see
what that feels like by myself.

00:25:45.340 --> 00:25:50.739
It gave me opportunities to win and see what
that felt like, so I grew up a lot.

00:25:50.739 --> 00:25:57.159
Um, so I would say New York, and LA and Nashville
and all these other awesome places to work

00:25:57.159 --> 00:25:59.919
and perform are always going to be there.

00:25:59.919 --> 00:26:07.450
You have your whole life, so as much training,
cause there are so many talented people out

00:26:07.450 --> 00:26:08.450
there.

00:26:08.450 --> 00:26:12.399
It just gives you an edge up if you have the
skill to back the craft.

00:26:12.399 --> 00:26:18.609
So I would say, educate, learn, take class,
whatever that means for you.

00:26:18.609 --> 00:26:20.629
That's the best advice I can give.

00:26:20.629 --> 00:26:24.169
And enjoy it, have fun!

00:26:24.169 --> 00:26:25.950
You're welcome.

00:26:25.950 --> 00:26:28.090
I hope you like my record.

00:26:28.090 --> 00:26:29.090
[ laughs ]

00:26:29.090 --> 00:26:32.089
&gt;&gt; Lee: So you are an avid Twitter user.

00:26:32.089 --> 00:26:33.089
&gt;&gt; Kristin: I love Twitter.

00:26:33.089 --> 00:26:34.099
&gt;&gt; Lee: Yeah, I was going to--

00:26:34.099 --> 00:26:35.261
&gt;&gt; Kristin: I love it

00:26:35.261 --> 00:26:38.679
&gt;&gt; Lee: I was going to ask what is your favorite
way to connect with your fans but I think

00:26:38.679 --> 00:26:40.059
the answer to that is Twitter.

00:26:40.059 --> 00:26:45.879
I think you've, I've got 7000 Tweets, 400,000
followers along those lines or something like

00:26:45.879 --> 00:26:46.879
that.

00:26:46.879 --> 00:26:48.450
&gt;&gt; Kristin: It's so crazy when I think about
it.

00:26:48.450 --> 00:26:53.590
I like to be able to say, first I thought,
I don't understand the concept of Twitter.

00:26:53.590 --> 00:26:55.479
Ashton; "Are you kidding me.

00:26:55.479 --> 00:26:57.749
I am having a hamburger right now, now I'm
going to the mall."

00:26:57.749 --> 00:26:58.749
That’s so dumb.

00:26:58.749 --> 00:27:04.070
[laughter] Now I am like "This man at the
airport is picking his toenails."

00:27:04.070 --> 00:27:08.879
I mean, I think it is so, I love Twitter.

00:27:08.879 --> 00:27:14.710
I love hearing as much as the followers of
me like to hear from me I like to hear from

00:27:14.710 --> 00:27:15.710
them.

00:27:15.710 --> 00:27:19.730
Like, the other day, this women was like "I
bite my tongue and who knew that the next

00:27:19.730 --> 00:27:22.330
day a chunk would be missing and it hurt so
bad!"

00:27:22.330 --> 00:27:26.020
I was like "I am so sorry, that has to suck!"

00:27:26.020 --> 00:27:29.749
I like to hear [ laughs ] I like to hear just
regular, cause I am pretty much down to earth.

00:27:29.749 --> 00:27:32.499
It's kind of what you see is what you get.

00:27:32.499 --> 00:27:35.570
So, um, anyway, that's why I love it, I love
it!

00:27:35.570 --> 00:27:37.719
&gt;&gt; Lee: Have you ever considered using Google
plus?

00:27:37.719 --> 00:27:39.950
[ laughter ]
It's kind of like Twitter.

00:27:39.950 --> 00:27:42.940
&gt;&gt; Kristin: Well when you ask me like that.

00:27:42.940 --> 00:27:43.940
[ laughter ]

00:27:43.940 --> 00:27:47.649
&gt;&gt; Lee: Yeah, I think there is software where
you can send Tweets and Facebook stuff and

00:27:47.649 --> 00:27:48.749
Google plus, we'll definitely hook you up
there.

00:27:48.749 --> 00:27:49.749
&gt;&gt; Kristen: You should hook me up.

00:27:49.749 --> 00:27:50.749
Well all right.

00:27:50.749 --> 00:27:53.359
&gt;&gt; Lee: It's pretty similar but you can, you
don't have to constrain yourself to however

00:27:53.359 --> 00:27:54.950
many characters it is.

00:27:54.950 --> 00:27:55.950
You can--

00:27:55.950 --> 00:27:57.809
&gt;&gt; Kristen: This has been my problem.

00:27:57.809 --> 00:28:01.119
[laughter]
&gt;&gt; Lee: Um, solved, solved, right here.

00:28:01.119 --> 00:28:02.193
I know we could, we could,

00:28:02.193 --> 00:28:03.193
&gt;&gt; Female #3: [comments off mic]

00:28:03.193 --> 00:28:04.193
&gt;&gt; Lee: We could, we could
&gt;&gt;Kristin: [singsongy] we could!

00:28:04.193 --> 00:28:05.193
&gt;&gt; Female #3: No I didn't mean here…

00:28:05.193 --> 00:28:06.193
&gt;&gt; Lee: Oh yeah, woooshsh! [ sighing ]

00:28:06.193 --> 00:28:07.193
&gt;&gt; Kristin: [ laughter ] Later, later.

00:28:07.193 --> 00:28:08.193
In private!

00:28:08.193 --> 00:28:11.719
No I am just kidding, just kidding, you know
I am just giving you crap.

00:28:11.719 --> 00:28:14.450
&gt;&gt; Lee: Um, how much time do we have?

00:28:14.450 --> 00:28:16.499
Do we have much time left?

00:28:16.499 --> 00:28:18.950
Is anyone going to cut me off, no, keep going?

00:28:18.950 --> 00:28:22.409
Alright, alright, I'm out of CDs, I know you
wanted one beforehand.

00:28:22.409 --> 00:28:23.839
I will give you mine.

00:28:23.839 --> 00:28:24.839
&gt;&gt; Kristin: No, I have one in my purse.

00:28:24.839 --> 00:28:27.239
&gt;&gt; Female #4: Then I want the one from your
purse!

00:28:27.239 --> 00:28:28.289
It's extra special.

00:28:28.289 --> 00:28:29.330
&gt;&gt; Kristin: Done!
[ laughter ]

00:28:29.330 --> 00:28:30.330
Done !

00:28:30.330 --> 00:28:35.629
&gt;&gt; Female #4: I loved when you sang "For Good"
for Oprah for her last show as her Morehead

00:28:35.629 --> 00:28:36.809
graduates surrounded her.

00:28:36.809 --> 00:28:37.809
&gt;&gt; Kristen: Thank you

00:28:37.809 --> 00:28:42.769
&gt;&gt; Female #4: And I was wondering what did
you envision a moment like that for yourself,

00:28:42.769 --> 00:28:43.769
what would that moment be?

00:28:43.769 --> 00:28:45.139
Who has changed you for the better?

00:28:45.139 --> 00:28:46.779
&gt;&gt; Kristin: Oh my God, I love this question.

00:28:46.779 --> 00:28:48.549
Nobody has ever asked me that.

00:28:48.549 --> 00:28:50.029
&gt;&gt; Female #4: Are you serious?

00:28:50.029 --> 00:28:54.179
I actually though; "She's probably been asked
this over and over again."

00:28:54.179 --> 00:28:58.889
&gt;&gt; Kristin: I would never be, could never
be famous enough or good enough to be Oprah,

00:28:58.889 --> 00:29:01.139
but that moment, um.

00:29:01.139 --> 00:29:11.679
Oh, man, I love this question, I think obviously
we all look for ways to give back and I do

00:29:11.679 --> 00:29:20.969
have a charity [ laughs ] Cause I know people
are going "of course" But I do, I love animals

00:29:20.969 --> 00:29:22.919
and I have a charity called Maddie's Corner.

00:29:22.919 --> 00:29:27.369
My dog Madeline Kahn, she started the charity.

00:29:27.369 --> 00:29:31.109
She whispered through her paw one night; "start
this charity under my name."

00:29:31.109 --> 00:29:36.940
But it basically helps animals get placed
into the right home for them.

00:29:36.940 --> 00:29:43.649
Because a lot of times we hear about dog that
get, you know, into a very kid friendly and

00:29:43.649 --> 00:29:44.870
they are not used to kids.

00:29:44.870 --> 00:29:50.249
So it helps facilitate that and sometimes
people who need animals, so it's animals helping

00:29:50.249 --> 00:29:53.009
people helping animals is the theme.

00:29:53.009 --> 00:29:59.149
So, in my perfect world, and we are a long
way from this, is that every displaced dog

00:29:59.149 --> 00:30:04.470
or cat or bird or snake or whatever, would
be in the right home.

00:30:04.470 --> 00:30:10.450
Like, I could image if someone was singing
"For Good" and I was an old lady and like

00:30:10.450 --> 00:30:16.889
all these dogs and cats and you know, with
their owners, I would just die.

00:30:16.889 --> 00:30:20.379
I just love animals, I just love them.

00:30:20.379 --> 00:30:23.190
And I love children too, those who can't speak
for themselves.

00:30:23.190 --> 00:30:28.970
Just, it kills me, I cannot, if I see a St.
Jude commercial, I am like [ crying ] here

00:30:28.970 --> 00:30:30.249
is $70,000.

00:30:30.249 --> 00:30:32.949
I won't be able to eat but I don't care.

00:30:32.949 --> 00:30:36.960
[ laughter ] I just can't if someone's been
abused or hurt or can't help themselves, I

00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:42.159
just can't, I know everybody is the same,
it's not like I am special in this belief,

00:30:42.159 --> 00:30:44.359
but that would be my moment.

00:30:44.359 --> 00:30:47.649
Thank you for asking me that, that was an
incredible moment for her to see what she

00:30:47.649 --> 00:30:48.649
has done.

00:30:48.649 --> 00:30:51.249
&gt;&gt; Female #5: [Inaudible]

00:30:51.249 --> 00:30:55.889
&gt;&gt; Kristin: She did the ugly cry, she did.

00:30:55.889 --> 00:31:00.649
I was just talking to, I did the Gail King
radio show today and she was saying that that

00:31:00.649 --> 00:31:03.710
was a very special moment because it forced
Oprah.

00:31:03.710 --> 00:31:08.469
Who's not always, we may always see her giving
but receiving is hard for her.

00:31:08.469 --> 00:31:15.359
So she had to receive that and so I was so
glad she was able to let loose and see what

00:31:15.359 --> 00:31:18.349
she had done, put all these men through college.

00:31:18.349 --> 00:31:20.129
I mean, "what?"

00:31:20.129 --> 00:31:23.259
Talk about making your mark on this world.

00:31:23.259 --> 00:31:25.159
She is great.

00:31:25.159 --> 00:31:26.419
Thank you.

00:31:26.419 --> 00:31:32.850
&gt;&gt; Lee: We have um, so I guess, kind of coming
back to Nashville and when you were in, you

00:31:32.850 --> 00:31:39.739
have a film and you are in New York, LA and
so I guess that you kind of came back to Nashville.

00:31:39.739 --> 00:31:42.980
Was it something that were kind of doing all
along?

00:31:42.980 --> 00:31:47.539
I spent a little time in Murfreesboro , I
went to school in Murfreesboro, actually.

00:31:47.539 --> 00:31:48.569
&gt;&gt; Kristin: Oh you did, where?

00:31:48.569 --> 00:31:49.569
&gt;&gt; Lee: Middle Tennessee State ??

00:31:49.569 --> 00:31:50.569
&gt;&gt; Kristin: MSTU right?

00:31:50.569 --> 00:31:52.940
&gt;&gt; Lee: Yeah, and I was like "What am I doing
here?" after a while.

00:31:52.940 --> 00:31:54.879
But after you mentioning Nashville.

00:31:54.879 --> 00:31:57.099
&gt;&gt; Kristin: But they have such good food.

00:31:57.099 --> 00:31:59.019
&gt;&gt; Lee: There is good food there, there is
good food.

00:31:59.019 --> 00:32:00.019
&gt;&gt; Kristin: I know.

00:32:00.019 --> 00:32:01.789
&gt;&gt; Lee: So how was that for you?

00:32:01.789 --> 00:32:03.059
Was it a great experience?

00:32:03.059 --> 00:32:06.329
Do you feel like it was kind of referring
to something familiar?

00:32:06.329 --> 00:32:12.750
&gt;&gt; Kristin: I mean, I grew up in a southern
state and I grew up singing and hearing that

00:32:12.750 --> 00:32:13.750
kinds of music.

00:32:13.750 --> 00:32:19.039
You know a lot of people on Broadway grew
up listening to cast albums and going to Broadway

00:32:19.039 --> 00:32:21.599
shoes, or tours and we didn't have that in
Broken Arrow.

00:32:21.599 --> 00:32:25.000
We had cast albums and I did like Les Mis
and the main ones.

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:31.909
But I had never heard of, like, certain shows
so I was into country music and gospel music.

00:32:31.909 --> 00:32:37.450
That was my whole thing so when I went to
do Opryland I feel in love with Nashville

00:32:37.450 --> 00:32:41.309
and I always said 'One day I would be back."

00:32:41.309 --> 00:32:48.509
And I'm twenty years later, um, back in Nashville
recording this record.

00:32:48.509 --> 00:32:53.179
Someone asked me the other day "Why country,
why now?"

00:32:53.179 --> 00:32:55.320
[ laughs ]
I understood the question cause that is not

00:32:55.320 --> 00:33:02.799
what I am known for, but since I was this
big, and I am now only this big [laughs ] since

00:33:02.799 --> 00:33:05.989
this big I wanted to make an album like this.

00:33:05.989 --> 00:33:15.859
So I am thrilled to put this country-pop feel
into the world and let people know how I grew

00:33:15.859 --> 00:33:20.759
up singing and I co-wrote a couple of the
songs so I am putting myself out there as

00:33:20.759 --> 00:33:22.029
a songwriter, too.

00:33:22.029 --> 00:33:26.369
Which is very scary, um and it's scary to
release an album like this cause you don't

00:33:26.369 --> 00:33:28.120
know if it will be accepted, you know.

00:33:28.120 --> 00:33:33.929
But I know that the product, I am so proud
of the things I got to say, which is you get

00:33:33.929 --> 00:33:35.789
to do that when you get to make a record.

00:33:35.789 --> 00:33:42.320
It's about what you have to say, so, um, Bob
Ezrin who did Pink Floyd's 'The Wall' and

00:33:42.320 --> 00:33:44.989
Alice Cooper and you name it, he was my producer.

00:33:44.989 --> 00:33:50.599
I had great songwriters, the best musicians
in Nashville and I just loved my time there.

00:33:50.599 --> 00:33:53.369
My jeans were so tight when I left cause I
was like "meat and three".

00:33:53.369 --> 00:33:58.370
They have this thing there like in Oklahoma
too like, ribs or brisket and you get three

00:33:58.370 --> 00:33:59.370
sides.

00:33:59.370 --> 00:34:01.239
You can pick macaroni and cheese,
&gt;&gt;Lee: okra

00:34:01.239 --> 00:34:06.209
&gt;&gt;Kristin: fried okra, I mean it was a smörgåsbord
; it was a festival of eating every day.

00:34:06.209 --> 00:34:10.149
I loved it so much, um, yeah, I loved Nashville.

00:34:10.149 --> 00:34:11.149
[ laughs ]

00:34:11.149 --> 00:34:14.119
&gt;&gt; Lee: The food always comes back to Google,
pretty good food here at lunch.

00:34:14.119 --> 00:34:16.049
And so most people are like "what's the best
things about Google?"

00:34:16.049 --> 00:34:18.000
&gt;&gt; Kristin: It's the food.

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:20.520
Your building is like unbelievable.

00:34:20.520 --> 00:34:23.129
How many people work here?

00:34:23.129 --> 00:34:26.710
&gt;&gt; Lee: Close to 2,000 I think; 3,000?

00:34:26.710 --> 00:34:28.029
&gt;&gt;Kristin: Are you joking?

00:34:28.029 --> 00:34:29.029
&gt;&gt;Lee: No way!

00:34:29.029 --> 00:34:30.029
Really?

00:34:30.029 --> 00:34:31.029
So it used to be-- [laughs]

00:34:31.029 --> 00:34:32.200
&gt;&gt; Kristin: I hope you guys like each other.

00:34:32.200 --> 00:34:33.200
[ laughter ]

00:34:33.200 --> 00:34:35.690
&gt;&gt; Lee: There is also enough room, now, so
we don't have to see one another.

00:34:35.690 --> 00:34:38.399
&gt;&gt; Kristin: You can tell it is a beautiful
space.

00:34:38.399 --> 00:34:39.399
&gt;&gt; Lee: It's great.

00:34:39.399 --> 00:34:40.399
Well, thank-you so much for coming.

00:34:40.399 --> 00:34:41.730
I think we are out of time.

00:34:41.730 --> 00:34:44.000
Let everyone please give it up for Kristin
Chenoweth.

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:45.000
[ applause ]

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:46.000
&gt;&gt; Kristin: Thank-you for having me.

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:46.002
Thank-you, guys!
