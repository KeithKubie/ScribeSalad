00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:04.500
The F-statistic is never negative. That's because we square each deviation,

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:09.358
making it positive. And when you do arithmetic with positive numbers, you'll

00:00:09.358 --> 00:00:14.013
always get a positive number as the result. This then has implications for the

00:00:14.013 --> 00:00:18.964
f distribution. Since the F-statistic is always positive, the f distribution

00:00:18.964 --> 00:00:24.589
will only be in the first quadrant, and it looks something like this.
