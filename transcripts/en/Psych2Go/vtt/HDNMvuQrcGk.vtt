00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.840
Hi everyone! Before we begin this video today,

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:13.670
we just want to say, thank you for helping us reach the big six zeroes and over 70 million views!

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.779
We will continue to do our best to provide consistent quality videos.

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:23.750
Our vision is to make psychology accessible for everyone at the same time as raising awareness on mental health.

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.180
Hope you guys continue to support us!

00:00:26.309 --> 00:00:32.569
We also now have a Patreon launch to put more money back into our content, team members, and outreaching initiatives.

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:38.660
Stick around for the end of the video to see how you can be involved, and without further ado, let's get right to it!

00:00:39.179 --> 00:00:44.929
Pop artist Andy Warhol states, "People should fall in love with their eyes closed." In this quote,

00:00:44.929 --> 00:00:50.839
he's referring to the magic people feel when they start to mean something to one another. It sounds ideal and spectacular,

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.498
but what if the person we fall for isn't who we think they are?

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.119
That's when it's important to keep our eyes open and watch out for what can put us in danger.

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.779
Here are seven early signs you may be in a toxic relationship.

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.129
One: Your partner has heavy ex-baggage.

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:13.700
Timing plays a major factor on relationships that can either make it or break it. If you find yourself constantly

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.319
consoling your partner as they mourn over their ex, then it's a sign they haven't moved on yet.

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:24.349
They need time to grieve and heal over the loss of their ex before they are ready to enter a relationship again.

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.070
But when you're in love,

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:33.050
it's easy to get hopeful and become blind to the fact that your partner isn't emotionally invested in you when their heart still belongs elsewhere.

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.319
Ultimately, you'll end up being the one getting hurt.

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:42.440
Recognize that your role isn't solely to be a shoulder to cry on. You deserve love just like anyone else.

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:50.330
But you can't receive that if you're busy being someone's rebound. Two: Your partner often lies to you about nearly everything.

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.099
There's no harm in telling an occasional white lie if it comes from a selfless place.

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.110
But if you find your partner constantly telling you lies even over small matters,

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:05.989
then it's time to re-evaluate how much you can trust them. A healthy relationship is built on honesty,

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:08.900
understanding, and open communication,

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:15.289
but your partner is only holding you back from going in that direct, but they choose not to tell you their true feelings and intentions.

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:22.610
Three: Your partner love bombs you. Love bombing is a technique emotional manipulators use to get what they want.

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:27.080
It involves offering you intense attention and bombarding you with many compliments.

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:32.659
When your partner tries to win your heart over, they will purposely put you on a pedestal to make you feel reliant on them.

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:37.549
They do this so they can be your only source you go to that makes you feel good about yourself.

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.269
But this dangerously develops into a codependent relationship.

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:43.939
That makes it toxic for the both of you.

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:50.029
In fact, we even made a video on the different types of emotional manipulation that you can check out later.

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:53.839
Four: Your partner frequently monitors you.

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:57.829
Checking in is important to make sure you and your partner are on the same page,

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:03.649
but if your partner is constantly bugging you, then they are stepping over the line and invading your sense of privacy.

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:09.319
Examples of frequent monitoring include asking to see your text messages, phone calls, and emails and

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.789
constantly calling or texting you throughout the day ask where you are or what you're up to.

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:17.750
This stems from insecurity and a need for them to feel in control,

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:21.828
which leaves you very little room to breathe and have a life outside of your relationship,

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.220
which is important to have in order to maintain your individuality.

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:31.369
Before we move to the next point, we want to also thank our sponsor betterhelp for making this video possible.

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:38.299
Better help is an affordable and reliable online counseling platform for everyone of all ages. If you're interested,

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:41.388
we left to refer a link in the video description below for you to use.

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:47.359
Five: Your partner isolates you. If you always feel like you need to ask for permission

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:52.579
before attending events with friends or to hang out with family, then your partner may be possessive.

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:58.549
Although it's sweet if your partner is protective of you, there's the difference between being caring versus being cleaned.

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:03.620
Abusers have a tendency to isolate their partner to prevent others from helping them escape.

00:04:04.139 --> 00:04:07.819
They may also try to stir up drama between you and your family and friends

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:12.880
so you no longer feel as close to them. This only helps them maintain their power and control over you.

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:16.820
Six: Your partner blows hot and cold on you a lot.

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:24.080
Abusers use the hot and cold technique in order to keep you on their leash. If your partner withdraws from you when upset them

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:27.830
but comes running back to you at full speed after you've done something to make them happy,

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:30.290
then this is their way of getting what they want.

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:36.110
The hot and cold treatment acts as a reinforcement for you to behave by their own terms and regulations.

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:38.719
This is how relationships turn into ownership

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:41.240
instead of equal compromise.

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:45.709
Seven: You constantly find yourself starting over with your partner.

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:49.309
Fighting is normal and expected in any relationship,

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:55.369
but if you have a common pattern of starting over with your partner frequently, then maybe it's time to examine why.

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:01.610
Keeping up often has a negative connotation associated to it, but sometimes it's also the right choice.

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:06.920
We usually hold on longer to something that's not working because we're afraid no one else will love us,

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:10.969
but this is how your fears ruin your chances of finding something real.

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:15.620
Love is always worth it if it means setting yourself free from the real people.

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:18.500
Are you experiencing these signs?

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:23.030
We want you to know that you're not alone and there are ways to seek help and safety.

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:28.850
As you guys might have noticed this week, we've been focusing a lot on topics related to toxic dynamics.

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:33.230
Do you want us to make more videos on toxic situations that haven't been covered yet?
