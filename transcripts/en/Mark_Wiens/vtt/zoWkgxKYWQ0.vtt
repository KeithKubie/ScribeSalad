00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.470
- Pieces of fish, the shrimp in there.

00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:03.470
The shrimp is half raw.

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:05.460
There are tomatoes in here, and cilantro.

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:08.375
I'm gonna grab a chip and I
have to begin with the ceviche.

00:00:08.375 --> 00:00:10.958
(upbeat music)

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.820
The food is all good here,
but their ceviche is just,

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:17.970
it's on the next level.

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:24.750
Good morning, I hope you're
having an amazing day.

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:25.670
It's Mark Wiens.

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:30.540
I am in Tulum, which is in the
Quintana Roo state of Mexico.

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:32.010
This is a gorgeous place.

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:35.180
It's the ancient Mayan port city.

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:37.520
And today we're just going
to have a lot of fun.

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:38.790
We're going to walk around Tulum.

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:39.623
We're going to explore Tulum.

00:00:39.623 --> 00:00:40.740
We're going to visit some of the sites.

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:42.490
We're going to eat some amazing food.

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:44.750
It's about 8:00 a.m., we
are starting at a place

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:46.780
for some legendary breakfast tacos.

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:48.120
I can't wait to try them.

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.710
Breakfast tacos are the best way

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.150
to start your day when you're in Mexico.

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:53.200
This place is called TaquerÃ­a Honorio.

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.370
They make all of their tortillas
right here immediately,

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.030
so you're eating fresh hot tortillas,

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:00.700
and then they assemble
everything over here.

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:02.360
They have some seating, they actually have

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:03.760
some bar counter seating
where you can sit,

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:04.950
and they have a bunch of red tables

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:06.250
where you can sit as well.

00:01:07.137 --> 00:01:10.137
(Spanish pop music)

00:01:18.128 --> 00:01:18.961
- Gracias.

00:01:19.875 --> 00:01:23.792
(speaking in foreign language)

00:01:29.772 --> 00:01:32.355
(upbeat music)

00:01:33.703 --> 00:01:36.286
(bell dinging)

00:01:42.271 --> 00:01:43.104
- Okay, so they have four main

00:01:43.104 --> 00:01:44.140
different types of tacos here.

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:46.365
We got one of each, I got
one of each on a plate.

00:01:46.365 --> 00:01:48.360
This one is the relleno negro,

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.530
which is a common Yucatan Peninsula dish.

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:53.480
This one is Cochinita Pibil.

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:56.210
This one is asada, carne
asada, with pork, though.

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:59.020
And finally, one of their
most well known tacos is

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:02.700
lechon al horno, which is,
this is a suckling pig,

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.300
and you can see that crackling skin.

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:06.510
It's an absolute joy to watch them as they

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:07.460
assemble the tacos.

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:08.410
They put all the ingredients,

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:10.040
they have all the different stewed meats

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:12.550
and braised meats, and they just,

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:14.270
they're so incredibly juicy.

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:15.670
They put them onto corn tortillas,

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.660
and then they just quickly
heat them over a hot plate.

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:19.860
There's nothing I'm
happier to see at 8:00 a.m.

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.000
in the morning than a plate of tacos.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.010
You can smell the
habanero chilies, and oh,

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:26.200
you can see the seeds in there, too.

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.300
So I'm gonna definitely
go under some of this,

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:30.980
and you can see some
cilantro in there as well.

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:32.050
That roast pig.

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:34.920
That skin, it's just irresistible.

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.100
Add a little bit of this.

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:37.560
Give it a squeeze of lime.

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:55.470
Oh wow.

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:59.190
It's awesome.

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:02.500
You've got the crunchy, but
ridiculously crispy skin.

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:05.530
The pork is just fall apart tender.

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:07.910
That is sort of like a guacamole,

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:09.720
maybe with a little bit of chili in it.

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.680
It's not very spicy, but it tastes,

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:12.513
it's so fragrant.

00:03:12.513 --> 00:03:13.840
You can taste that cilantro in there.

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.330
The onions.

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:18.270
I'm gonna try some of the
other, it's like a green salsa.

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:23.760
Oh.

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.480
Oh that's the habanero I was looking for.

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:26.460
Oh that's awesome.

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:29.949
And that pork, that just
melts in your mouth.

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:32.640
It's so juicy, it's so tender.

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:35.530
That first taco was insane.

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:37.480
I gotta add on some of the pico de gallo.

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:40.350
There's some onions and tomatoes
in here, and some cilantro,

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:41.910
and maybe a little bit of cabbage as well.

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:44.680
I'm gonna need to load that
up with that habanero salsa.

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:46.204
Oh that's awesome.

00:03:46.204 --> 00:03:48.787
(upbeat music)

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:00.050
You can taste the smokiness of

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:01.550
that grilled pork in that one.

00:04:07.805 --> 00:04:09.320
So there's some beans in that one, too.

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:13.050
Okay next up is the relleno negro de pavo,

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:16.740
and this is a Yucatan
Peninsula dish as well.

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:21.030
It's a black stew, black
chili stew with turkey.

00:04:35.933 --> 00:04:40.933
You can taste the, it's like
a complex flavor in there.

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:45.000
You can taste those blackened
chilies a little bit,

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
but it's still kind of mild.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.760
But the turkey is so tender,
it almost tastes like pork.

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:54.930
Final taco is the Cochinita Pibil.

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:57.450
This is another type of
a stewed or braised pork.

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:03.430
I think I'm in love with
this habanero salsa.

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:16.430
Excellent as well, and all four of them

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:17.263
are totally different.

00:05:17.263 --> 00:05:20.120
Yeah, this one again is
just fall apart tender pork.

00:05:21.676 --> 00:05:24.676
(people chattering)

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:30.840
I tried all four different kinds,

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:33.170
and I'd have to say the
best one was the lechon,

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:35.150
that roast pig with the crispy skin.

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:37.350
Yeah, that's a taco you can't miss

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:39.281
when you come here to Tulum.

00:05:39.281 --> 00:05:41.864
(upbeat music)

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:46.740
That was an unbelievable stop.

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:49.070
Tacos for breakfast, a huge success.

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:50.530
We're in the car now,
and we're on our way to

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:52.280
the ruins of Tulum,
which is one of the main

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:54.030
things to see when you visit Tulum.

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:05.960
And you pass through there,

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:09.594
some salesmen that try to
sell tours at the front,

00:06:09.594 --> 00:06:10.520
but then you just keep coming back.

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:12.110
They have a parking lot here.

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:13.650
We paid 100 pesos for parking,

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:15.200
and then we're gonna walk into the ruins.

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:17.210
I think it's a little bit of a walk.

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:18.960
How much did entrance cost, Carlos?

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:33.280
We just made it into
the ruins, the complex.

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:34.950
But in order to get
here from the car park,

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:36.680
you can either choose to buy,

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:38.670
we didn't actually know
what we were doing,

00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:42.325
and we got the little bus
trolley tickets for 20 pesos,

00:06:42.325 --> 00:06:44.790
and that drives you into the entrance,

00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:46.130
or you could walk for it.

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:47.800
I think it's like a
kilometer and a half, or so.

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:49.040
It's not that long.

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:50.330
Actually, I would've preferred to walk,

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:52.050
but we didn't even know.

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:56.420
And then, after that, you get
to the entrance of the park,

00:06:56.420 --> 00:06:58.560
and we paid 70 pesos for tickets,

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:03.430
and now we are walking into the
archeological zone of Tulum.

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:05.860
The plant life here is
absolutely gorgeous.

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:07.460
It's a mix of tropical plants.

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:08.430
I mean, it's mostly tropical,

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:10.130
but then all of a sudden,
you'll seen Ming rose,

00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:14.760
you'll see like some kind of
dry looking plants like cactus.

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:15.940
It's really lush.

00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:19.454
It's really thick as well, the greenery.

00:07:19.454 --> 00:07:21.610
(laughing)

00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:23.595
Mika loves it.

00:07:23.595 --> 00:07:24.580
Whoa, Mika.

00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:28.370
There's an iguana right overe there.

00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:31.188
He just blends right into that rock.

00:07:31.188 --> 00:07:33.771
(upbeat music)

00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:37.690
Oh, we walked in the
walls and it just open up.

00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:43.230
Quickly just to share with you
a little bit about the city,

00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:44.600
or the ruins of Tulum.

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:47.210
This is an ancient walled
city of the Mayans,

00:07:47.210 --> 00:07:48.960
which was built and which was inhabited

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:51.750
between the 13th and the 15th centuries,

00:07:51.750 --> 00:07:53.640
and it was a port city.

00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:55.680
It's right along the Caribbean coast,

00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:57.590
the beautiful turquoise ocean.

00:07:57.590 --> 00:07:59.522
And the port served Coba, which is,

00:07:59.522 --> 00:08:02.930
I think it's about 50
kilometers or so inland

00:08:02.930 --> 00:08:04.510
into the Yucatan Peninsula.

00:08:04.510 --> 00:08:06.520
We're gonna go to the coastline first

00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:09.500
to see the castle, and hopefully
get a view of the ocean.

00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:14.630
And the castle was one
of the most well known of

00:08:14.630 --> 00:08:16.950
all the structures within
this entire complex.

00:08:16.950 --> 00:08:18.300
Something that I was just reading is that

00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:19.870
it used to be brightly painted.

00:08:19.870 --> 00:08:22.570
So if you can imagine the turquoise coast

00:08:22.570 --> 00:08:25.350
with the Mayan castle
here, and the entire city,

00:08:25.350 --> 00:08:27.030
and then brightly painted.

00:08:27.030 --> 00:08:28.170
It would have been incredible,

00:08:28.170 --> 00:08:32.611
I mean, it's incredible to see
now in its ruined condition.

00:08:32.611 --> 00:08:34.810
But imagine if it was
just brightly painted.

00:08:34.810 --> 00:08:36.515
It would be, yeah.

00:08:36.515 --> 00:08:38.280
It's a majestic site.

00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:39.780
It's been cloudy the entire morning,

00:08:39.780 --> 00:08:40.990
but right as I step up here,

00:08:40.990 --> 00:08:43.500
the sun came out from out of the clouds,

00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:45.540
and you can see the water just sparkling.

00:08:45.540 --> 00:08:48.034
Yeah, it's an insanely beautiful view.

00:08:48.034 --> 00:08:50.617
(upbeat music)

00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:11.320
The steps are a little bit slippery

00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:13.160
because of all the sand,
and there's a lot of people,

00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:15.700
but oh man, those views are just gorgeous.

00:09:17.579 --> 00:09:20.579
(people chattering)

00:09:22.482 --> 00:09:23.315
Oh.

00:09:23.315 --> 00:09:24.410
Freezing cold.

00:09:24.410 --> 00:09:26.100
Oh yeah, that's refreshing.

00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:28.540
Oh, but it's crystal clear.

00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:30.510
It is turquoise.

00:09:30.510 --> 00:09:34.240
You've got the Mayan ruins
right above on these rocks.

00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:39.140
It's yeah, it's absolutely picture pretty.

00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:41.723
(upbeat music)

00:10:06.410 --> 00:10:08.540
I think the highlight for me is that

00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:09.860
they're not only ruins,

00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:13.190
but they are right next
to the gorgeous ocean.

00:10:13.190 --> 00:10:15.360
And that's what really makes it beautiful.

00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:22.980
From here, we're just
gonna take a quick drive

00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:24.870
to Playa Paraiso, which is Paradise Beach,

00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:25.840
just down the coast from here.

00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:28.184
And then after that, it's time for lunch.

00:10:28.184 --> 00:10:30.767
(upbeat music)

00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:41.720
We just pulled up to Playa Paraiso.

00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:43.450
There is some parking
on the street for free,

00:10:43.450 --> 00:10:45.750
but then you can come inside
and they charge 50 pesos.

00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:47.510
So we came inside.

00:10:47.510 --> 00:10:50.010
It's pretty nice and
relaxed, so laid back here.

00:10:50.914 --> 00:10:53.497
(upbeat music)

00:10:59.690 --> 00:11:01.020
One thing you'll notice here is that

00:11:01.020 --> 00:11:04.220
the sand is so powdery fine.

00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:05.890
It feels amazing on your feet, actually.

00:11:05.890 --> 00:11:06.723
It's so fine.

00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:34.870
Well, my hair is starting to
look like the Caribbean coast,

00:11:34.870 --> 00:11:36.480
wind-swept.

00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:38.930
But we are so hungry right now.

00:11:38.930 --> 00:11:40.250
We're on our way to go eat lunch.

00:11:40.250 --> 00:11:42.837
And this is gonna be a
really, really good spot.

00:11:42.837 --> 00:11:45.420
(upbeat music)

00:11:56.433 --> 00:11:58.954
(car honking)

00:11:58.954 --> 00:12:00.750
It was about a 20 minute drive from Tulum,

00:12:00.750 --> 00:12:01.770
but we drove down the highway,

00:12:01.770 --> 00:12:03.960
and then we got into this
really local neighborhood

00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:08.010
where there's villas, and a
little off the beaten path.

00:12:08.010 --> 00:12:09.090
This is beautiful back here.

00:12:09.090 --> 00:12:10.520
I think this is the restaurant.

00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:12.930
I found it just searching
the map on Google Maps,

00:12:12.930 --> 00:12:14.660
and it looked like a place we have to eat.

00:12:14.660 --> 00:12:16.210
They're known for their seafood.

00:12:16.210 --> 00:12:19.330
It's just a real laid back
kind of beach restaurant,

00:12:19.330 --> 00:12:21.680
and it's called Chamico's.

00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:22.513
Oh.

00:12:24.914 --> 00:12:25.747
(people chattering)

00:12:25.747 --> 00:12:27.530
Yellow tables out here by the beach.

00:12:27.530 --> 00:12:29.780
Just, they kind of look like mango,

00:12:29.780 --> 00:12:31.460
kind of like a mango forest back here,

00:12:31.460 --> 00:12:34.150
but it's breezy, it's cool.

00:12:34.150 --> 00:12:38.050
You see you're greeted by
just a pile of coconuts,

00:12:38.050 --> 00:12:41.400
and hammocks are laying
all randomly all around.

00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:43.920
I think they mostly
only serve seafood here.

00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:45.420
Oh, this is great.

00:12:45.420 --> 00:12:47.350
Okay, I'm extremely hungry.

00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:50.900
And fried fish, too.

00:12:51.859 --> 00:12:53.710
Ceviche chamicos.

00:12:53.710 --> 00:12:55.010
Ceviche chamicos.

00:12:56.121 --> 00:12:56.954
- Hold on, hold on, I'll
be chilling back here.

00:12:56.954 --> 00:12:58.608
- I have to practice my Spanish?

00:12:58.608 --> 00:13:00.179
- Yeah.

00:13:00.179 --> 00:13:01.408
- Ceviche chamicos.

00:13:01.408 --> 00:13:05.325
(speaking in foreign language)

00:13:08.060 --> 00:13:09.570
- This is the type of
restaurant you can just

00:13:09.570 --> 00:13:14.570
walk around barefoot, and this
is an ultimate chill spot.

00:13:16.251 --> 00:13:19.251
(people chattering)

00:13:24.501 --> 00:13:29.140
(speaking in foreign language)

00:13:29.140 --> 00:13:31.490
- Yeah, we're pretty hungry.

00:13:32.946 --> 00:13:35.529
(upbeat music)

00:13:44.671 --> 00:13:46.880
It feels good next to the fire.

00:13:54.635 --> 00:13:56.885
(sizzling)

00:14:03.210 --> 00:14:06.980
This is the open air,
Caribbean style kitchen.

00:14:06.980 --> 00:14:08.910
They have a fish, just one type of fish,

00:14:08.910 --> 00:14:10.400
and he said it's similar to a red snapper.

00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:11.233
It's a local fish.

00:14:11.233 --> 00:14:12.556
We got our fish.

00:14:12.556 --> 00:14:13.680
We got a big one.

00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:15.880
He cut clits into it
then he added some salt,

00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:17.610
and then straight into this giant

00:14:17.610 --> 00:14:20.740
cauldron of bubbling oil over fire.

00:14:20.740 --> 00:14:23.093
That's a huge amount of oil.

00:14:23.093 --> 00:14:25.343
(sizzling)

00:14:32.026 --> 00:14:34.609
(upbeat music)

00:14:36.143 --> 00:14:38.476
(squeaking)

00:14:39.499 --> 00:14:40.332
Ah.

00:14:46.550 --> 00:14:48.070
The food has all arrived.

00:14:48.070 --> 00:14:49.950
We got a couple of different ceviches,

00:14:49.950 --> 00:14:51.750
including the ceviche chamico,

00:14:51.750 --> 00:14:53.440
which is a mix of seafood.

00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:58.280
It's mostly fish, shrimp, raw
shrimp, and lobster in there.

00:14:58.280 --> 00:15:00.150
And it looks, it's so juicy.

00:15:00.150 --> 00:15:01.630
You can see the lime juice in there.

00:15:01.630 --> 00:15:02.810
You can see some cilantro.

00:15:02.810 --> 00:15:05.130
We also got just a ceviche pescado,

00:15:05.130 --> 00:15:07.420
which is just fish ceviche.

00:15:07.420 --> 00:15:09.720
And then we got a giant fried fish,

00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:12.960
and then we also got a coctel de camaron,

00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:15.000
which is a shrimp cocktail.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.440
I'm gonna grab a chip and I
have to begin with the ceviche.

00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:19.060
And this is the ceviche chamico.

00:15:19.060 --> 00:15:22.250
So you can see pieces of
fish, the shrimp in there.

00:15:22.250 --> 00:15:23.250
The shrimp is half raw.

00:15:23.250 --> 00:15:25.180
There are tomatoes in here, and cilantro.

00:15:25.180 --> 00:15:28.010
Oh, and then I think the
whole lobster is like,

00:15:28.010 --> 00:15:29.180
still within here.

00:15:29.180 --> 00:15:31.310
So you can de-shell it yourself.

00:15:31.310 --> 00:15:33.720
There might be some
lobster mixed in as well.

00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:34.800
Oh, that is gorgeous.

00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:36.940
There's a whole peppercorn
in there as well.

00:15:36.940 --> 00:15:38.190
Oh, that's how I like it.

00:15:39.401 --> 00:15:41.734
(crunching)

00:15:46.857 --> 00:15:47.690
Mm.

00:15:48.530 --> 00:15:49.363
Oh.

00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:52.086
It took a few chews for all the flavors

00:15:52.086 --> 00:15:54.730
to come onto my tongue.

00:15:54.730 --> 00:15:56.540
You taste the black pepper,
you taste the citrus,

00:15:56.540 --> 00:15:57.800
the lime in there.

00:15:57.800 --> 00:16:00.110
Oh, the shrimp is fresh.

00:16:01.073 --> 00:16:05.250
It's just saturated with that lime juice.

00:16:05.250 --> 00:16:07.490
Oh, it's incredibly refreshing.

00:16:07.490 --> 00:16:08.690
Oh that's insanely good.

00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:12.070
I'm gonna add on some of the salsa,

00:16:12.070 --> 00:16:15.030
which is, it just looks
like pure chilies in some,

00:16:15.030 --> 00:16:16.400
maybe in some salt water.

00:16:19.450 --> 00:16:21.360
Yeah, it doesn't taste like
the ceviche itself, as spicy,

00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:23.700
but they do give you a
nice bowl of chilies.

00:16:30.340 --> 00:16:31.173
Wow.

00:16:33.090 --> 00:16:34.530
Oh.

00:16:34.530 --> 00:16:36.330
You immediately taste those chilies.

00:16:37.908 --> 00:16:41.480
Possibly habanero, but yeah,

00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:43.820
they're a little bit spicy, but that just.

00:16:43.820 --> 00:16:45.810
Not too spicy, but perfectly spicy.

00:16:46.710 --> 00:16:48.960
That completely complements
the entire thing.

00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:50.993
Oh.

00:16:50.993 --> 00:16:53.060
Those shrimp in there, those raw shrimp.

00:16:53.060 --> 00:16:56.650
They have this amazing, slightly crisp,

00:16:56.650 --> 00:16:57.750
gooey texture to them.

00:17:08.010 --> 00:17:09.630
I don't think it's been
cooked with the whole ceviche.

00:17:09.630 --> 00:17:11.420
I think they just added it
to the ceviche at the end.

00:17:11.420 --> 00:17:13.420
Maybe, it tastes almost like it's fried.

00:17:14.330 --> 00:17:16.370
Okay, next up, this is
the coctel de camaron,

00:17:16.370 --> 00:17:18.350
which is the shrimp cocktail.

00:17:18.350 --> 00:17:19.260
There's avocado on top.

00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:20.180
There's onion mixed in,

00:17:20.180 --> 00:17:22.860
and then it's kind of a tomato-y sauce.

00:17:25.740 --> 00:17:27.460
It's a little sweeter than other

00:17:27.460 --> 00:17:29.230
versions of cocktail that I've had.

00:17:29.230 --> 00:17:30.970
I think with a little bit of lime,

00:17:30.970 --> 00:17:32.100
it would be awesome.

00:17:32.100 --> 00:17:33.400
The shrimp tastes really good,

00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:34.720
and I love that creamy avocado,

00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:36.820
and those crunchy onions in there as well.

00:17:40.420 --> 00:17:42.420
It almost has a fruity flavor to it.

00:17:42.420 --> 00:17:43.990
Like a fruity tomato flavor.

00:17:43.990 --> 00:17:45.720
It almost tastes like mango in there.

00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:46.890
Like a pureed mango.

00:17:46.890 --> 00:17:48.450
Next up to try the fried fish,

00:17:48.450 --> 00:17:50.570
and this is a pretty good sized fish.

00:17:50.570 --> 00:17:52.830
They sliced it so it gets
extra deep fried-ness

00:17:52.830 --> 00:17:56.720
on those filets, and yeah,
that was a little bit of

00:17:57.644 --> 00:17:58.850
some brown oil, but it looks fantastic.

00:17:58.850 --> 00:18:01.340
I'm gonna squeeze on a little lime juice.

00:18:05.310 --> 00:18:08.390
And I just grab a chunk
from the side here.

00:18:08.390 --> 00:18:10.390
Oh yeah, you can feel how moist that is.

00:18:15.430 --> 00:18:17.413
Yeah, it's really, really crispy.

00:18:17.413 --> 00:18:19.500
Yeah, it's just fried
with a little bit of salt,

00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:21.250
maybe a little bit of pepper in there.

00:18:22.170 --> 00:18:24.840
But I know it will make it amazing.

00:18:25.740 --> 00:18:28.230
And then also another squeeze of lime.

00:18:28.230 --> 00:18:30.106
Oh, there's some onions
on the side here, too,

00:18:30.106 --> 00:18:30.939
that I wanna eat it with as well.

00:18:30.939 --> 00:18:32.610
Maybe a few onions on there.

00:18:32.610 --> 00:18:33.790
Okay, I might need to.

00:18:33.790 --> 00:18:36.540
I'm gonna pick this up with
a spoon now, to get it all.

00:18:48.692 --> 00:18:51.880
Yeah, that salsa, it can
make everything better.

00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:54.010
It's such a sharp spiciness.

00:18:54.010 --> 00:18:55.390
I mean, it's not that incredibly spicy,

00:18:55.390 --> 00:18:56.223
but it's really sharp.

00:18:56.223 --> 00:18:57.810
We ran out of chips,

00:18:57.810 --> 00:19:00.240
so I'm just gonna use my spoon
to eat some of this ceviche.

00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:01.610
And this is the last dish that we got.

00:19:01.610 --> 00:19:03.160
This is just ceviche de pescado,

00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:05.790
which is just a fish ceviche.

00:19:05.790 --> 00:19:07.100
There's tomatoes in here, and onions,

00:19:07.100 --> 00:19:09.660
and cilantro again.
(upbeat music)

00:19:09.660 --> 00:19:11.460
This makes the ceviche just perfect.

00:19:24.670 --> 00:19:29.670
Okay, I love the ceviche
with the mix of everything

00:19:29.826 --> 00:19:32.496
and the shrimp, but I just love the fish.

00:19:32.496 --> 00:19:33.387
Just pure fish.

00:19:33.387 --> 00:19:34.772
The freshness of it.

00:19:34.772 --> 00:19:36.301
The fish is soft and tender.

00:19:36.301 --> 00:19:39.914
It's so juicy because of that lime juice.

00:19:39.914 --> 00:19:41.790
It's salty, it's peppery.

00:19:41.790 --> 00:19:43.710
And yeah, with that
salsa with those chilies,

00:19:43.710 --> 00:19:44.990
that makes it perfect.

00:19:44.990 --> 00:19:45.980
It's insanely good.

00:19:54.300 --> 00:19:57.300
(people chattering)

00:20:08.740 --> 00:20:10.961
The food is all good here.

00:20:10.961 --> 00:20:15.780
But their ceviche is just,
it's on the next level.

00:20:15.780 --> 00:20:17.160
It's so good.

00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:18.570
It's so fresh.

00:20:18.570 --> 00:20:20.330
It's so refreshing.

00:20:20.330 --> 00:20:21.980
The balance of flavor is perfect.

00:20:22.930 --> 00:20:25.280
Yeah, the food and the setting here is

00:20:26.210 --> 00:20:27.570
absolutely outstanding.

00:20:27.570 --> 00:20:28.860
What's your favorite dish?

00:20:28.860 --> 00:20:29.940
- My favorite dish,

00:20:32.611 --> 00:20:34.240
I think it was a tie between that fish,

00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:36.500
the fried fish was good,
and the ceviche fish,

00:20:36.500 --> 00:20:38.147
which was good.

00:20:38.147 --> 00:20:39.857
Good choice, good.

00:20:39.857 --> 00:20:42.440
(upbeat music)

00:20:52.660 --> 00:20:54.890
- The ceviche here, it's just,

00:20:54.890 --> 00:20:56.988
it's so good, it's so well balanced.

00:20:56.988 --> 00:21:00.290
Perfectly salty and peppery.

00:21:00.290 --> 00:21:02.890
Just with a little bit
of that chili salsa.

00:21:02.890 --> 00:21:05.580
Oh it was, I loved it,
absolutely loved it.

00:21:05.580 --> 00:21:08.410
The setting here, the relaxation,

00:21:08.410 --> 00:21:11.065
the laid back chillness of this place.

00:21:11.065 --> 00:21:13.190
This is absolutely great.

00:21:13.190 --> 00:21:14.330
It's time for dessert.

00:21:24.329 --> 00:21:25.410
What a perfect dessert.

00:21:25.410 --> 00:21:26.243
Come on.

00:21:30.330 --> 00:21:34.230
We are just gonna relax here
for the rest of the day,

00:21:34.230 --> 00:21:36.960
hang out, lay in the hammock,

00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:40.440
and oh, this is, I am loving this.

00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:42.210
Oh Mika, you got the spoon now.

00:21:42.210 --> 00:21:44.010
Gonna have some more of the coconut.

00:21:46.470 --> 00:21:47.303
Look Mika.

00:21:52.248 --> 00:21:55.990
(speaking in foreign language)

00:21:55.990 --> 00:21:57.690
Mika is loving it here, too.

00:21:58.540 --> 00:21:59.373
Mika.

00:22:00.470 --> 00:22:02.690
Mika, okay Mika, let's take a nap.

00:22:03.820 --> 00:22:04.870
Okay Mika, let's take a nap.

00:22:05.934 --> 00:22:08.580
(laughing)

00:22:08.580 --> 00:22:11.001
I know quite a few people
who have visited Tulum,

00:22:11.001 --> 00:22:14.370
and every single person that
I know that's been to Tulum

00:22:14.370 --> 00:22:15.930
absolutely loves it.

00:22:15.930 --> 00:22:18.200
It's a place that you
can fall in love with.

00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:21.100
It's beautiful, the culture is fantastic,

00:22:21.100 --> 00:22:22.750
the food is delicious.

00:22:22.750 --> 00:22:24.680
It's a wonderful place
to visit in the world.

00:22:24.680 --> 00:22:26.820
And so, yeah, we were gonna do more,

00:22:26.820 --> 00:22:28.050
but I think we're actually just gonna

00:22:28.050 --> 00:22:30.350
hang out here for the
rest of the afternoon.

00:22:30.350 --> 00:22:33.230
And oh man, just completely take it easy.

00:22:33.230 --> 00:22:36.500
This place just completely
relaxed us to the max,

00:22:36.500 --> 00:22:39.100
to the point where we just
decided to call it a day

00:22:39.100 --> 00:22:40.340
right here and just hang out here

00:22:40.340 --> 00:22:41.250
for the rest of the day.

00:22:41.250 --> 00:22:42.450
And that food, too.

00:22:42.450 --> 00:22:44.130
My buddy Carlos is in that hammock.

00:22:44.130 --> 00:22:45.950
I think he fell asleep already.

00:22:45.950 --> 00:22:50.080
So we are just relaxing,
ultimate relaxing here.

00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:51.340
But I'm gonna end the video now.

00:22:51.340 --> 00:22:54.900
This is, oh, this is the
ultimate relaxing place.

00:22:54.900 --> 00:22:56.550
Yeah, that's all there is to it.
