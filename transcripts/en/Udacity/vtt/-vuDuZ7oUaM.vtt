00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.337
Let's do a speedup averaging quiz. Let's say we

00:00:03.337 --> 00:00:06.700
have an old laptop and a new laptop. Let's

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:09.885
say that we have two applications that are representative

00:00:09.885 --> 00:00:13.330
for our workloads: a homework formatting application, and a

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:17.510
virus scan application. For homework formatting, going from the

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:20.380
old laptop to the new laptop on homework formatting

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:22.364
gives us a speed up of 2. For virus

00:00:22.364 --> 00:00:25.406
scanning, going from the old laptop to the new

00:00:25.406 --> 00:00:29.965
laptop gives us a speed up of 8. So overall, going from the

00:00:29.965 --> 00:00:35.150
old laptop to the new laptop gives us a speedup of how much?
