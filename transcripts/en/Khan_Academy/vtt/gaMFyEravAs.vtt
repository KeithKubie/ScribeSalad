00:00:00.702 --> 00:00:01.514
- [Voiceover] Hey grammarians,

00:00:01.514 --> 00:00:02.514
today I'm gonna talk about the idea

00:00:02.514 --> 00:00:04.650
of the indefinite pronoun,

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:06.182
which looks kinda complicated

00:00:06.182 --> 00:00:08.598
but really just does
what it says on the tin.

00:00:08.598 --> 00:00:11.081
An indefinite pronoun is just that,

00:00:11.081 --> 00:00:15.562
it's indefinite, undefined, uncertain.

00:00:15.562 --> 00:00:16.793
These are pronouns that we use when

00:00:16.793 --> 00:00:18.947
we're not being especially specific.

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:20.485
Words like

00:00:20.485 --> 00:00:25.485
any, anybody, each, everyone, nobody.

00:00:26.405 --> 00:00:27.801
Any time I need to remember

00:00:27.801 --> 00:00:30.284
what words fall into this category

00:00:30.284 --> 00:00:31.469
of indefinite pronouns,

00:00:31.469 --> 00:00:32.489
I just think of the song

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.581
Everybody Needs Somebody to Love,

00:00:34.581 --> 00:00:35.692
originally by Solomon Burke,

00:00:35.692 --> 00:00:37.969
and then later made famous
by the Rolling Stones

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:39.374
and the Blues Brothers.

00:00:39.374 --> 00:00:41.245
So a cool thing about indefinite pronouns,

00:00:41.245 --> 00:00:42.289
actually there are a couple.

00:00:42.289 --> 00:00:44.540
Number one, they can be used as both

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:47.229
subject or object in a sentence.

00:00:48.372 --> 00:00:49.464
So if you said to me,

00:00:49.464 --> 00:00:51.167
"David, do you want pizza?"

00:00:51.167 --> 00:00:52.521
I could respond,

00:00:52.521 --> 00:00:54.689
"Yes, please! I'd love some,"

00:00:54.689 --> 00:00:56.959
using it as an object,

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:59.051
or equally plausibly I could say,

00:00:59.051 --> 00:01:01.565
"Yes, please! Some would be great,"

00:01:01.565 --> 00:01:04.055
using it as a subject.

00:01:04.055 --> 00:01:06.043
Another really cool thing
about indefinite pronouns

00:01:06.043 --> 00:01:08.807
is that the words both,
neither, and either

00:01:08.807 --> 00:01:10.711
retain the dual.

00:01:10.711 --> 00:01:12.287
They are some of the only words in English

00:01:12.287 --> 00:01:15.069
that refer to only two things.

00:01:15.911 --> 00:01:17.283
So these three pronouns are actually

00:01:17.283 --> 00:01:18.883
a little bit less indefinite than

00:01:18.883 --> 00:01:21.927
most indefinite pronouns
because they refer to

00:01:21.927 --> 00:01:24.247
a set of two things.

00:01:24.247 --> 00:01:25.150
So if someone asks me,

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:28.334
"Do you like mangoes or cherries more?"

00:01:28.334 --> 00:01:29.055
I could say,

00:01:29.055 --> 00:01:30.911
"I like both equally,"

00:01:30.911 --> 00:01:33.559
referring to the cherries and the mangoes

00:01:33.559 --> 00:01:34.998
at the same time.

00:01:34.998 --> 00:01:36.439
And this is really strange because,

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:40.546
in English, this dual case
doesn't really exist anymore

00:01:40.546 --> 00:01:44.544
except for in very limited amounts

00:01:44.544 --> 00:01:46.398
because English distinguishes between

00:01:46.398 --> 00:01:48.278
whether or not there's one of something

00:01:48.278 --> 00:01:49.742
and more than one of something,

00:01:49.742 --> 00:01:52.342
but this is one of the very few cases

00:01:52.342 --> 00:01:53.922
where we ever distinguish between

00:01:53.922 --> 00:01:55.502
more than one of something

00:01:55.502 --> 00:01:58.162
and specifically two of something.

00:01:58.162 --> 00:01:59.738
There are not a whole
lot of words in English

00:01:59.738 --> 00:02:01.149
that refer to that,

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:02.706
so I think that's really cool.

00:02:04.298 --> 00:02:07.072
The third cool thing about
indefinite pronouns is that

00:02:07.072 --> 00:02:10.532
they're usually treated
as singular, usually.

00:02:10.532 --> 00:02:13.131
So words like both, neither, and either

00:02:13.131 --> 00:02:15.616
are obviously plural but there are some

00:02:15.616 --> 00:02:17.538
that are a little bit fuzzier.

00:02:18.912 --> 00:02:20.052
For example, in this sentence,

00:02:20.052 --> 00:02:21.304
"Nobody was home,"

00:02:21.304 --> 00:02:24.110
we use the word was, the singular form.

00:02:24.971 --> 00:02:28.083
Even though that nobody could
refer to multiple people,

00:02:28.083 --> 00:02:30.493
or it's really referring
to the absence of anyone.

00:02:31.592 --> 00:02:32.915
Similarly, in this sentence

00:02:32.915 --> 00:02:34.935
"Everybody knows that I love onions,"

00:02:34.935 --> 00:02:36.931
we use the word knows, just like we'd say

00:02:36.931 --> 00:02:39.763
he knows, she knows, it knows.

00:02:39.763 --> 00:02:42.197
So that's the singular form of that verb.

00:02:43.411 --> 00:02:45.778
Even though the idea of everybody

00:02:45.778 --> 00:02:48.306
would seem to refer to
more than one person.

00:02:48.306 --> 00:02:50.538
The indefinite pronoun that we use

00:02:50.538 --> 00:02:53.439
to refer everybody usually conjugates

00:02:53.439 --> 00:02:58.038
the third person singular
form of verbs, usually.

00:02:58.038 --> 00:03:01.102
Let's get to one of the
weirder examples, though,

00:03:01.102 --> 00:03:03.030
because sometimes the context can

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:04.958
carry you along into something that

00:03:04.958 --> 00:03:07.370
might seem a little quote, unquote

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:09.717
"ungrammatical" but
really reflects the way

00:03:09.717 --> 00:03:12.153
that language is used today.

00:03:12.153 --> 00:03:12.989
And so although you might say

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:15.661
"Everyone is looking at me,"

00:03:16.741 --> 00:03:19.990
here's an example from
Garner's Modern American Usage,

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:21.845
which is one of the
several car-sized books

00:03:21.845 --> 00:03:25.514
I'm using to construct
this grammar course.

00:03:25.514 --> 00:03:29.185
"Everyone was crouched behind
furniture to surprise me,

00:03:29.185 --> 00:03:31.943
"but I already knew they were there."

00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:34.897
And you can see in the
beginning of this sentence,

00:03:34.897 --> 00:03:37.497
we say "Everyone was,"

00:03:37.497 --> 00:03:39.676
but then in the second
part of the sentence,

00:03:39.676 --> 00:03:41.812
we say "they were,"

00:03:41.812 --> 00:03:44.435
and we're using they to refer to everyone.

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:48.292
So how can this be?

00:03:48.292 --> 00:03:49.935
This doesn't seem grammatical.

00:03:51.196 --> 00:03:52.936
But as Garner says,

00:03:52.936 --> 00:03:56.878
"Sometimes meaning rather than
grammar governs agreement."

00:03:58.579 --> 00:04:00.155
Is this grammatical?

00:04:00.155 --> 00:04:03.152
Yes, in that it makes sense.

00:04:03.152 --> 00:04:06.703
Does it adhere concretely
and in an iron-clad way

00:04:06.703 --> 00:04:08.472
to these rules that we've established?

00:04:08.472 --> 00:04:12.347
No, but language is kind
of messy in that way.

00:04:12.347 --> 00:04:14.691
Sometimes the meaning of the sentence,

00:04:14.691 --> 00:04:17.687
the fact that here everyone
refers to multiple people

00:04:17.687 --> 00:04:20.567
is going to override the rules

00:04:20.567 --> 00:04:22.611
that are previously established.

00:04:22.611 --> 00:04:23.747
And that's okay,

00:04:23.747 --> 00:04:25.369
as long as you're making sense.

00:04:26.371 --> 00:04:29.019
So relative pronouns are usually singular,

00:04:29.019 --> 00:04:33.314
unless the context drags them
into the realm of plural.

00:04:33.314 --> 00:04:34.663
So like their name implies,

00:04:34.663 --> 00:04:37.545
sometimes indefinite
pronouns can be a little...

00:04:37.545 --> 00:04:39.178
indefinite.

00:04:39.178 --> 00:04:40.479
Alright, here are the three cool things

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:41.986
about indefinite pronouns.

00:04:41.986 --> 00:04:45.142
Number one, they can be
used as subjects or objects.

00:04:45.142 --> 00:04:48.602
Both, neither, and either
retain the dual form,

00:04:48.602 --> 00:04:49.485
which is super weird.

00:04:49.485 --> 00:04:52.806
And number three, indefinite
pronouns are usually

00:04:52.806 --> 00:04:54.817
treated as singular.

00:04:54.817 --> 00:04:56.098
Usually.

00:04:56.098 --> 00:04:57.118
I know that's confusing,

00:04:57.118 --> 00:04:58.490
but I have faith in you.

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:00.177
You can learn anything.

00:05:00.177 --> 00:05:01.272
David, out.
