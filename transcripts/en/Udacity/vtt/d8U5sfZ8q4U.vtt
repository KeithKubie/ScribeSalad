00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:01.710
So I'm sitting here
with Lauren Castellano,

00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:03.640
who's a production
strategist here at Udacity.

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:06.210
She deals a lot with producing
material for our online courses.

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.900
She's going to talk to us a little
bit about creating online content.

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.510
So thank you so much for
talking to us today Lauren.

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:12.220
&gt;&gt; You're so welcome.
&gt;&gt; So

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:13.380
the first thing I wanted to ask is,

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.379
any of students who are familiar with
other platforms may have noticed it.

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.540
The production values at
Udacity tend to be very high,

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:20.380
and I don't mean that
solely as a compliment.

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:23.140
Because when you produce
content more on budget,

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:25.500
it's easier to make it available
to a large number of people, and

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.890
when you have a high cost associated
with it, it kind of creates a barrier.

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.930
So why do we invest so
much into our course production process?

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:35.250
&gt;&gt; So I really look at it
as a long-term investment.

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.290
You wouldn't put this much time and

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.130
money in a class we're just
going to release to 50 people.

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:44.030
So we're seeing, we want to see this
through, and see students learn from

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:49.540
these classes for years,
with edits to update them, but.

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:53.190
Another thing we've really done is
we're investing the student experience,

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.380
not just the course itself.

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:59.810
So yes we could give our highly
qualified instructors a camera and

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:03.280
they can just stand in front
of a blank screen and talk,

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:08.700
but we add a lot to it so that the
students can have the best experience.

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.880
So it takes a lot to have
all the different quizzes or

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.310
just making it a little bit fun.

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:16.780
When we were talking about material
design and filming with Porsches,

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:20.050
you just add some stuff and
it makes a better student experience.

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:23.380
So it's investing in your
student not just the course.

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:26.020
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it sounds like we're
kind of taking that opportunity,

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:29.230
knowing that instead of just this being
presented to 75 students a semester,

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:31.830
it's going to be presented to
thousands or tens of thousands or

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:35.300
hundreds of thousands of students
to really increase what we do.

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:36.670
And do maybe we'd like to always do, but

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:38.750
we just don't have the resources
to do it, initially.

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:41.360
And that's one of the things we tell our
professors when we're getting started

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.470
with our courses is, this is
the opportunity to do what you've

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:46.000
always dreamed of doing
with this course.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.900
Because you probably can't get the
funding to do it when you're teaching it

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:52.060
to 75 students once a year, but
if you're teaching it to 300 students

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.070
three times a year,
you can do a lot more.

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:57.300
So in your position you deal with
a lot of people who have never taught

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:58.080
online before.

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.640
Many of them are experienced teachers
in person who are just making

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.090
the transition to the Internet.

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.100
Others are subject matter experts
who have no teaching experience and

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.530
they're just experts in some
domain that we're interesting in.

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:11.690
So, let me ask you first when you're
dealing with a teacher professor who has

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:15.360
an abundance of in-person teaching
experience but has never taught online.

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.260
What are some of the unique issues you
wrestle with in trying to transition

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.860
them to teaching in this
online environment?

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:26.180
&gt;&gt; There a lot of things, one thing that
you really have to address early on is

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:29.360
the nerves that come
with teaching online.

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.720
That a lot of people don't
really want to talk about.

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:36.200
But when you teach in a classroom to
30 people, if you kind of mess up

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.690
explaining something, oh well,
shoot your students an email.

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.260
But when you're recording that and

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:47.080
broadcasting that to potentially 100,000
students, it's a little more terrifying.

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:52.380
And another thing I see really often is,
with the more experienced instructors,

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:55.370
is they start to teach for their peers.

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:56.780
And, not for their students.

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:58.356
Because they have to look good for
their peers and

00:02:58.356 --> 00:03:00.014
people that they're going
to see at conferences.

00:03:00.014 --> 00:03:04.920
And, that can get a little bit
dangerous from a students perspective.

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.808
But one of, I think, the best things
that come out of that is that

00:03:08.808 --> 00:03:13.056
the teachers, the professors will
validate their material even more

00:03:13.056 --> 00:03:16.368
than they would just standing
in front of 35 people,

00:03:16.368 --> 00:03:19.550
because they know it's
going to be out there forever.

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:23.660
They know their peers are going to be
reviewing this too, and they take more

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:27.790
pride in that, and, I think, so those
nerves can kind of play in our favor,

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:32.070
but also against us, when we start to
lose the student experience in that.

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:35.780
So when they try to teach too high
level, and it's like, don't do that.

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:38.590
&gt;&gt; So when we're dealing with that issue
and we really want to make professors

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:42.100
remember the student experience and not
just focus on teaching for their peers.

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:44.980
What are some of the things that
they can do in this environment that

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:47.910
they can't do in the regular classroom,
that we need to make them aware of?

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:48.940
&gt;&gt; That's a great topic.

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:51.200
Because when you get to teach online,
the sky's the limit.

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:52.810
You have so many options.

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:55.810
And it's really important that you
think about, when developing a class,

00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:00.580
that you think about,
what are the good teaching tools or

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:02.940
examples that I've used in class.

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:07.580
Strictly because I'm
constrained within four walls,

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:10.000
and how can we expand on that?

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.940
The sky is the limit when
you are teaching online.

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:13.910
You can do a million different things,

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:18.240
and use really cool teaching examples
that you could never use in a classroom.

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:22.320
One of my favorite examples is when
I got to teach with sea lions and

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:24.640
I was teaching about classical and
operate conditioning.

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:26.170
We got to go to a laboratory,

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:29.375
see some sea lions and
teach the students that way.

00:04:29.375 --> 00:04:33.385
And they could see how sea lions
were learning husbandry skills.

00:04:33.385 --> 00:04:34.345
It was really awesome.

00:04:34.345 --> 00:04:37.565
And I could never bring a sea
lion into a university classroom.

00:04:37.565 --> 00:04:38.755
I've asked, they won't let me.

00:04:38.755 --> 00:04:39.696
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; So

00:04:39.696 --> 00:04:42.855
you can really stretch the box that way.

00:04:42.855 --> 00:04:45.555
And it's really important for
instructors who have taught the same

00:04:45.555 --> 00:04:48.825
class for every semester for
the last ten years,

00:04:48.825 --> 00:04:52.070
and they use the same syllabus,
to kind of just shred that.

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:55.390
I would like to tell our instructors
don't just think outside of the box,

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:57.460
there is no box.

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:00.090
The world is your oyster when
it comes to teaching online,

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:03.730
so really just getting that creativity
out of them, when they're so

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:07.010
accustomed to doing the same thing over
and over again could be challenging.

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:09.507
But it's endlessly important for
a student experience.

00:05:09.507 --> 00:05:12.530
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I imagine that with many of our
professors who have been teaching for so

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:14.733
long they're very good at
the way they teach right now.

00:05:14.733 --> 00:05:17.583
But I've encountered some at least
that I think have forgotten that

00:05:17.583 --> 00:05:20.533
certain constraints that they have,
and it started as constraints,

00:05:20.533 --> 00:05:23.370
that now they're just kind of
part of the fabric of the course.

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:25.670
It's something like I have the topics
broken up in a certain way,

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:28.700
well you only have the topics broken up
like that because you've been forced to

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:32.150
teach hour and a half lectures all,
for the past 20 years.

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:35.160
Now you can have a 15 minute lecture
followed by an hour long one.

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:36.930
So you have a lot of flexibility there.

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:37.500
But what about for

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:41.490
those incoming instructors who have
no teaching experience whatsoever.

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:44.880
They're subject matter experts at Google
or Facebook or something and, they don't

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:46.990
know what it's like to teach at all,
but they're experts in their field.

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:49.330
How do we help them get
accustomed to this?

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:52.690
&gt;&gt; So, one thing that's great about
the subject matter experts is

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:54.230
they've never started within that box.

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:59.770
So, they are really good with
the creativity and just expanding on

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:04.040
different ideas in giving the practical
application of what they're teaching.

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:07.330
One of the things that we
have to remind them to do is

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:09.130
anticipate student's questions.

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:12.430
And they don't have experience
with students in a classroom,

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:15.200
raising their hand saying, wait,
I don't understand that point.

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:19.930
So as course developers,
we try to highlight different areas.

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:23.950
And you see expert blind spot
a lot with subject matter experts.

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:27.050
When you don't as much
with professors because

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:30.470
they're used to students saying no,
that doesn't make sense.

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:33.610
So teaching them about expert blind
spot and saying okay, you're using

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:37.170
jargon there that your intro students
are not going to understand.

00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:39.680
And they're in environments where

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:42.920
they don't have to think about that
kind of stuff, which is great for them.

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:44.082
But it's important for

00:06:44.082 --> 00:06:47.577
the students that they don't do
that anymore when they're teaching.

00:06:47.577 --> 00:06:50.230
&gt;&gt; So, Lauren is an expert at producing
online content and as a result,

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:52.677
she may be using jargon that some
of you aren't familiar with.

00:06:52.677 --> 00:06:56.150
[LAUGH] So, Lauren, can you tell our
students what expert blind spot is?

00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:56.870
&gt;&gt; Shame on me.

00:06:56.870 --> 00:07:00.730
Well so expert blind spot is when
you have an expert in a field and

00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:02.900
they use jargon or explain the topic and

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:08.040
forget that some people might not know
the foundation that the expert has.

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:12.630
So you have to take yourself back a few
steps and figure out what it is that

00:07:12.630 --> 00:07:16.170
you just assume people know and
what it is people actually do know.

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:20.830
So we try to have people lose
their expert blind spot,

00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:24.628
by not having an assumption of
the knowledge a student has coming in.

00:07:24.628 --> 00:07:28.250
We actually need to go in, and
explore what their base knowledge is.

00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:32.634
&gt;&gt; I have a very fond memories of
my freshman calculus class being

00:07:32.634 --> 00:07:35.938
taught by a Nobel Prize
nominated physicist.

00:07:35.938 --> 00:07:37.805
&gt;&gt; Fun.
&gt;&gt; Who had no idea what it was like to

00:07:37.805 --> 00:07:39.565
not know how to do a derivative.

00:07:39.565 --> 00:07:41.225
And so yeah, I think that's-
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:07:41.225 --> 00:07:42.310
&gt;&gt; A very important
thing to wrestle with.

00:07:42.310 --> 00:07:46.380
And because we deal with so many
subject matter experts here at Udacity,

00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:49.070
it's even more pertinent, because
they have no teaching experience.

00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:50.770
All they know is their field.

00:07:50.770 --> 00:07:51.670
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; But I think you're right,

00:07:51.670 --> 00:07:54.600
it's also a great chance to have that
kind of blank slate to work with

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:58.340
someone who hasn't developed any bad
habits or hasn't really incorporate

00:07:58.340 --> 00:08:01.511
those constraints of the classroom
into their outlook on teaching.

00:08:01.511 --> 00:08:02.110
&gt;&gt; Exactly.

00:08:02.110 --> 00:08:05.170
&gt;&gt; So in this classroom we might have
many people who produce online content

00:08:05.170 --> 00:08:08.290
for this class or might go into
teaching online in the future.

00:08:08.290 --> 00:08:11.484
In fact, that's one of the project ideas
for this class is to actually film

00:08:11.484 --> 00:08:14.440
a mini-course for
some topic you're interested in.

00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:17.050
So for those who might want to do
that for this class or in the future,

00:08:17.050 --> 00:08:19.630
what advice would you give them on
getting started with online teaching?

00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:24.200
&gt;&gt; I would say to really
reflect on your past teachers.

00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:28.210
Pick and choose what things that they
would do that you really, really liked,

00:08:28.210 --> 00:08:29.990
and really dissect that.

00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:34.210
Were they good teachers because of
the context they were teaching in, so

00:08:34.210 --> 00:08:36.909
were they great in a classroom, or
do you think what they were doing would

00:08:36.909 --> 00:08:41.860
translate really well to online,
and how can you expand on that?

00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:46.010
Just shred every syllabus you've ever
seen and really start from scratch.

00:08:46.010 --> 00:08:48.210
Do the whole,
think way outside of the box.

00:08:48.210 --> 00:08:51.770
That there just is no more box,
and be creative.

00:08:51.770 --> 00:08:54.710
Start out with the most
outlandish ideas, and

00:08:54.710 --> 00:08:58.790
then reel it in based on
your production constraints.

00:08:58.790 --> 00:09:02.540
That way, you know, you'll at
least have a fun class at the end.

00:09:02.540 --> 00:09:04.960
Another thing is to be
a really honest consumer.

00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:08.300
You know, how long is it and when you're
watching this video until you want to

00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:11.130
speed me up or skip to the next video?

00:09:11.130 --> 00:09:13.870
And then try to reflect on that and

00:09:13.870 --> 00:09:16.890
make a class that you would
actually want to watch.

00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:21.380
Sometimes sitting through
a 20 minute screen cast or

00:09:21.380 --> 00:09:24.140
head shot is not how you want to do it.

00:09:24.140 --> 00:09:27.830
Most students would just fast forward or
be done with it.

00:09:27.830 --> 00:09:32.360
So reflect on that and think about
the content you're making and

00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:34.780
make sure that you're
picking the right medium.

00:09:34.780 --> 00:09:37.890
Some things are just better
if people read them.

00:09:37.890 --> 00:09:40.950
If you could create a PDF that they
should reflect on then come back to

00:09:40.950 --> 00:09:43.320
video or discussion forum.

00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:47.260
I don't know if you'll have that or
not, but look at your content and

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:51.490
then pick the best medium to teach that,
teach that content by.

00:09:51.490 --> 00:09:52.680
So is it video?

00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:54.740
Is it a screen cast of something?

00:09:54.740 --> 00:09:56.320
Is it a reading node?

00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:57.890
Which we call a reading node, but

00:09:57.890 --> 00:10:02.100
I guess in your case you'd probably be
creating a PDF, but something like that.

00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:04.780
I think the most important thing
is being the honest student.

00:10:04.780 --> 00:10:07.066
Think about things from
a student's perspective.

00:10:07.066 --> 00:10:09.700
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I know that we've probably
given you some examples of some

00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:11.970
courses out there that we
consider to be high quality.

00:10:11.970 --> 00:10:14.600
We have not given you any examples of
courses that we don't consider to be

00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:16.890
high quality because we don't
want that attached to us, but

00:10:16.890 --> 00:10:19.170
feel free to ask your fellow
classmates on the forums for

00:10:19.170 --> 00:10:21.830
examples of online courses
they've taken that were not good.

00:10:21.830 --> 00:10:24.076
And they might recommend some
courses from other platforms.

00:10:24.076 --> 00:10:25.311
They might recommend
some Udacity courses.

00:10:25.311 --> 00:10:26.888
They might recommend some
Georgia Tech courses.

00:10:26.888 --> 00:10:29.655
But that will give you something
to actually learn from, and

00:10:29.655 --> 00:10:31.509
see not only what to do but
what not to do.

00:10:31.509 --> 00:10:33.390
So, thank you so much Lauren for
talking to us today.

00:10:33.390 --> 00:10:34.099
&gt;&gt; You're so welcome, yeah.

00:10:34.099 --> 00:10:35.420
&gt;&gt; And thank y'all for watching.
