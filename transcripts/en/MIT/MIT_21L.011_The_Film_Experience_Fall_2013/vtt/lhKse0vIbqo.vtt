DAVI THORBURN: In thinking
about how the course has

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:13.290
to evolve given the availability
of all this new technology,

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.890
one thing I've especially
thought about-- worried

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.500
about, actually-- is how much
of my own lecture material,

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.500
which I now have on video to
make available to them, as

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:28.460
against my live performance, and
whether my live performance is

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:29.790
even necessary at all.

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:34.780
How does it differ from-- and I
still haven't worked that out.

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:37.160
For two semesters now,
I have taught the course

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:41.000
with a combination of live
lectures and video lectures.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.930
And I've asked the students
to tell me in commentaries

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:46.460
whether they saw
much difference,

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:48.293
and whether they preferred
one to the other,

00:00:48.293 --> 00:00:49.870
or whether they had
strong feelings.

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:54.830
And so far, the
testimony has been, meh.

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:58.300
They don't seem too interested
in the question, which makes

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.130
me a little nervous, actually.

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:03.920
So my feeling is that it's
still an open question.

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:05.990
One thing I definitely
have decided

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:08.130
I will be able to do
with this video material

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.090
is using it in other courses.

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:12.080
If I an in advanced
course in film,

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.080
and students haven't taken
my earlier film course,

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:17.490
I can send them to this
material and have them use it.

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.210
So it's immensely valuable
as a teaching tool.

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:24.920
But how to integrate it
into the existing course

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:28.030
remains a conundrum I
haven't quite figured out.

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:29.800
As I've begun to work
on this, now it's

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:31.790
been some years since
I've started to have

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:34.630
some video lectures available.

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:38.850
I think I realize that
I was naive in imagining

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.820
that the transition
would be easy,

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:42.860
that moving into a
video format was simply

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:44.730
a matter of
transferring what I say,

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:48.570
because in fact, the live
environment turns out

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.880
to be more central
and more important.

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.930
And my feelings as I'm
in the life environment

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.680
turn out to be more
essential and more important

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:59.970
than they might otherwise be.

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:04.350
There's something about being
in a live environment that

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.530
affects me, and I think
other teachers, maybe not

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.200
all teachers, but other
teachers very deeply.

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:12.880
I used to have
the fantasy when I

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:16.060
was in front of a large
audience of students,

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:22.980
maybe as many as 100 or 150,
I had the delusion or illusion

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.120
that I was in touch with
every student in the class,

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:30.279
and that every single one of
them was paying attention,

00:02:30.279 --> 00:02:32.070
and than when they
didn't, I could feel it,

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:33.670
and that I could see
there was a student who

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:34.836
would stop paying attention.

00:02:34.836 --> 00:02:37.600
I would somehow walk in
that direction of the class

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.150
or get that student's attention.

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.440
Now, I'm sure it was a
fantasy because how could you

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.500
be aware of 100 students?

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.620
But I had the illusion
that I was aware of them.

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.450
I was certainly aware
of many of them.

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:49.010
I was aware of them
as individuals.

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:52.410
I was aware of whethet-- and
I felt I had them wrapped.

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:56.970
And when I felt I was losing
them, I would change pace.

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:00.950
Maybe it has something to do
with a theatrical aspect to me

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:04.980
that really doesn't help much
with being a good teacher.

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.030
But maybe it does help
with being a good teacher,

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:08.930
and that maybe good
teachers do have

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:12.570
to have a bit of the ham
in them and like being

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:14.050
in front of audiences.

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:16.220
This is a special
problem for the Western,

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:19.850
because it celebrates American
individualism so powerfully.

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:21.890
The iconic scene of
the Western in which

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:25.380
two men wearing gun square
off against each other,

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:28.630
and the quicker one survives,
that scene of the quick draw,

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:31.390
and of the [? dif ?]
and the dusty street,

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:34.650
can be said to be a kind of
embodiment of these values

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:37.470
in which you have
to rely on yourself.

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:38.790
You can't rely on someone else.

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:39.950
You can't rely on
the government.

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:41.330
You can't rely on the Sheriff.

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:42.770
You can't rely on the police.

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:44.380
You can't rely on
your neighbors.

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:45.870
You have to trust yourself.

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:47.570
And in fact, one
of the ways you can

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:50.190
see the power of these
Western mythologies operating,

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:52.210
as it seems to me
in some sense, one

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:54.000
of the great divides
in the States

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.590
today over the question
of guns and gun control

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:01.445
is partly grounded in these
myths of individualism,

00:04:01.445 --> 00:04:03.280
that the Western
mythology has been

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:06.700
promulgating since before
the advent of the movies.

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:08.850
And I think part of what
makes my teaching good

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:12.920
is that I'm in a kind of trance
when I'm in front of a class,

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:17.140
in the sense that I am utterly
oblivious to what I look

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:18.640
like, I know for one thing.

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:22.510
I have done teachers
nightmare kinds of things,

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:26.050
like having my shirt unbuttoned
without realizing it, or coming

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:30.370
in with my hair incredibly
askew without knowing about it.

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:32.200
Once I gave a lecture at Yale.

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:33.730
I had young children
at the time.

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:34.894
And I had a child.

00:04:34.894 --> 00:04:36.560
My wife was with the
two other children.

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:38.480
I had to take a
child to a doctor.

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:40.430
We took him to the doctor.

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:41.950
But I had to go to
give my lecture.

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:43.465
So I took him into
the lecture hall.

00:04:43.465 --> 00:04:45.465
And I sat him down in the
corner of the lecture.

00:04:45.465 --> 00:04:47.079
And he was about
seven years old.

00:04:47.079 --> 00:04:49.120
And he sat nicely in the
seat for a little while.

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:50.659
I wasn't paying
attention to him.

00:04:50.659 --> 00:04:51.450
Then he climbed up.

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:52.969
I was lecturing on a stage.

00:04:52.969 --> 00:04:54.260
And he climbed up on the stage.

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:55.580
And he went behind me.

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:57.360
And he sat in a big
chair behind me.

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:59.170
And he made faces.

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:01.310
And the students begin to laugh.

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:04.530
And I couldn't understand
what was going on.

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:10.360
But it taught me a great lesson
in the theatrical reality

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:12.260
of the lecture hall.

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:15.350
So I've come more
fully to understand

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:17.750
that things that are
hard to articulate

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:20.240
or that I at least had not
much thought about, certainly

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:23.120
have not been written about
in pedagogical literature,

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:26.940
about the ambiance
of the live classroom

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:29.890
has some effect on lecturing.

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:32.120
I mean it should have
effect in smaller classrooms

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:34.010
even more fully, I think.

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:39.110
But for lectures, I
think it's important too.

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:45.330
And the transition to purely
video lectures loses that.

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:47.790
How big a loss that is,
or whether that loss can

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:51.026
be compensated for in other
ways is a good question.
