information between members of the tribe
now when I say members of the tribe we

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:35.260
now when I say members of the tribe we
 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:38.100
now when I say members of the tribe we
can go back to prehistory again a tribe

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:38.110
can go back to prehistory again a tribe
 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:41.250
can go back to prehistory again a tribe
that has the knowledge of how to start a

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:41.260
that has the knowledge of how to start a
 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.740

fire instead of just steal one or how to

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:43.750
fire instead of just steal one or how to
 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:46.740

make a superior bow and arrows is going

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:46.750
make a superior bow and arrows is going
 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:49.440
make a superior bow and arrows is going
to have a serious advantage over the

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:49.450
to have a serious advantage over the
 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:53.010
to have a serious advantage over the
other tribes and that advantage can be

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.020
other tribes and that advantage can be
 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:55.830
other tribes and that advantage can be
measured in lives and deaths so

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:55.840
measured in lives and deaths so
 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.190
measured in lives and deaths so
knowledge has power in real world power

00:01:59.190 --> 00:01:59.200
knowledge has power in real world power
 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.570
knowledge has power in real world power
so secretiveness about knowledge is

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:02.580
so secretiveness about knowledge is
 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:05.550
so secretiveness about knowledge is
something that we've had with us for

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:05.560
something that we've had with us for
 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.440
something that we've had with us for
millennia because whoever possesses

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450
millennia because whoever possesses
 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.780
millennia because whoever possesses
useful knowledge has advantage over the

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790
useful knowledge has advantage over the
 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:14.120
useful knowledge has advantage over the
competitors

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130

so it is not surprising that a more
 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.090
so it is not surprising that a more
narrow scientific tribe was quite

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.100
narrow scientific tribe was quite
 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.850
narrow scientific tribe was quite

the sales of the books because they are

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:24.760
the sales of the books because they are
 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:28.680
the sales of the books because they are
expensive so at a time when Newton and

heading journals out meant that a lot

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:27.320
heading journals out meant that a lot
 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:30.310

more people could do and publish science

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:30.320
more people could do and publish science
 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:33.820
more people could do and publish science
and get maybe livelihood from it maybe

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:33.830
and get maybe livelihood from it maybe
 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:37.120

science then became different because
you could do a couple of experiments and

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:40.820
you could do a couple of experiments and
 

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:42.220
you could do a couple of experiments and
publish immediately you don't have to

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:42.230
publish immediately you don't have to

different parts of the study and posting

00:19:54.210 --> 00:19:54.220
different parts of the study and posting
 

00:19:54.220 --> 00:19:56.849
different parts of the study and posting
them online in real time and then only

00:19:56.849 --> 00:19:56.859
them online in real time and then only
 

00:19:56.859 --> 00:19:58.619

in the end you put all those pieces

00:19:58.619 --> 00:19:58.629
in the end you put all those pieces
 

00:19:58.629 --> 00:20:00.810
in the end you put all those pieces
together and call them a paper this is a

00:20:00.810 --> 00:20:00.820
together and call them a paper this is a

everything is done then you submit and
then suddenly secrecy is over you're

of where we are right now so I'm going

00:20:32.310 --> 00:20:32.320
of where we are right now so I'm going
 

00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:33.269
of where we are right now so I'm going
to be able to go through this a little

00:20:33.269 --> 00:20:33.279
to be able to go through this a little
 

00:20:33.279 --> 00:20:35.340
to be able to go through this a little
bit more quickly I will be talking to

00:20:35.340 --> 00:20:35.350
bit more quickly I will be talking to
 

00:20:35.350 --> 00:20:37.049
bit more quickly I will be talking to
you about one of the specific

00:20:37.049 --> 00:20:37.059
you about one of the specific
 

00:20:37.059 --> 00:20:39.269
you about one of the specific
applications that boar was alluding to

which is open notebook science so

00:20:42.210 --> 00:20:42.220
which is open notebook science so
 

00:20:42.220 --> 00:20:44.430
which is open notebook science so
there's actually a definition now on

00:20:44.430 --> 00:20:44.440
there's actually a definition now on

Wikipedia and if you're interested in

00:20:46.919 --> 00:20:46.929
Wikipedia and if you're interested in
 

00:20:46.929 --> 00:20:50.009
Wikipedia and if you're interested in
you know links articles and all that

00:20:50.009 --> 00:20:50.019
you know links articles and all that
 

00:20:50.019 --> 00:20:51.749
you know links articles and all that
kind of thing you can go but the idea is

00:20:51.749 --> 00:20:51.759
kind of thing you can go but the idea is
 

00:20:51.759 --> 00:20:53.879
kind of thing you can go but the idea is
very simple is that if you're doing a

00:20:53.879 --> 00:20:53.889
very simple is that if you're doing a
 

00:20:53.889 --> 00:20:56.099
very simple is that if you're doing a
research as an experimentalist in the

00:20:56.099 --> 00:20:56.109
research as an experimentalist in the
 

00:20:56.109 --> 00:20:58.830
research as an experimentalist in the
lab you keep a lab notebook if you make

00:20:58.830 --> 00:20:58.840
lab you keep a lab notebook if you make
 

00:20:58.840 --> 00:21:01.289
lab you keep a lab notebook if you make
that lab notebook completely public and

00:21:01.289 --> 00:21:01.299
that lab notebook completely public and
 

00:21:01.299 --> 00:21:03.599
that lab notebook completely public and
as close to real time as you can that's

00:21:03.599 --> 00:21:03.609
as close to real time as you can that's
 

00:21:03.609 --> 00:21:05.970
as close to real time as you can that's
open notebook science so what that means

00:21:05.970 --> 00:21:05.980
open notebook science so what that means
 

00:21:05.980 --> 00:21:07.919
open notebook science so what that means
is that you know you don't decide I'm

00:21:07.919 --> 00:21:07.929
is that you know you don't decide I'm
 

00:21:07.929 --> 00:21:09.269
is that you know you don't decide I'm
going to share this experiment but not

00:21:09.269 --> 00:21:09.279
going to share this experiment but not
 

00:21:09.279 --> 00:21:12.029
going to share this experiment but not
this one and the reason for that is we

00:21:12.029 --> 00:21:12.039
this one and the reason for that is we
 

00:21:12.039 --> 00:21:13.730
this one and the reason for that is we
really want to see how science happens

00:21:13.730 --> 00:21:13.740
really want to see how science happens
 

00:21:13.740 --> 00:21:15.470
really want to see how science happens
and we want to see the failures as well

00:21:15.470 --> 00:21:15.480
and we want to see the failures as well
 

00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:17.030
and we want to see the failures as well
as the successes we want to see the

00:21:17.030 --> 00:21:17.040
as the successes we want to see the
 

00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:18.680
as the successes we want to see the
errors get corrected we want to see how

00:21:18.680 --> 00:21:18.690
errors get corrected we want to see how
 

00:21:18.690 --> 00:21:20.660
errors get corrected we want to see how
the whole thing happens so that's

00:21:20.660 --> 00:21:20.670
the whole thing happens so that's
 

00:21:20.670 --> 00:21:22.310
the whole thing happens so that's
basically what i mean by open notebook

00:21:22.310 --> 00:21:22.320
basically what i mean by open notebook
 

00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:26.600
basically what i mean by open notebook
science now again going back to some of

00:21:26.600 --> 00:21:26.610
science now again going back to some of
 

00:21:26.610 --> 00:21:29.180
science now again going back to some of
the concepts of war was mentioning we

00:21:29.180 --> 00:21:29.190
the concepts of war was mentioning we
 

00:21:29.190 --> 00:21:31.280
the concepts of war was mentioning we
want to be able to track the provenance

00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:31.290
want to be able to track the provenance
 

00:21:31.290 --> 00:21:32.570
want to be able to track the provenance
of the information as it goes through

00:21:32.570 --> 00:21:32.580
of the information as it goes through
 

00:21:32.580 --> 00:21:34.640
of the information as it goes through
and one of the things we forget when we

00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:34.650
and one of the things we forget when we
 

00:21:34.650 --> 00:21:37.010
and one of the things we forget when we
read a journal article or a book is we

00:21:37.010 --> 00:21:37.020
read a journal article or a book is we
 

00:21:37.020 --> 00:21:38.690
read a journal article or a book is we
start to believe what it actually says

00:21:38.690 --> 00:21:38.700
start to believe what it actually says
 

00:21:38.700 --> 00:21:41.180
start to believe what it actually says
are facts alright but any measurements

00:21:41.180 --> 00:21:41.190
are facts alright but any measurements
 

00:21:41.190 --> 00:21:42.530
are facts alright but any measurements
right there's actually no such thing as

00:21:42.530 --> 00:21:42.540
right there's actually no such thing as
 

00:21:42.540 --> 00:21:44.930
right there's actually no such thing as
a fact every measurement is embedded

00:21:44.930 --> 00:21:44.940
a fact every measurement is embedded
 

00:21:44.940 --> 00:21:46.520
a fact every measurement is embedded
within assumptions and if you don't know

00:21:46.520 --> 00:21:46.530
within assumptions and if you don't know
 

00:21:46.530 --> 00:21:48.200
within assumptions and if you don't know
what those assumptions are then you're

00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:48.210
what those assumptions are then you're
 

00:21:48.210 --> 00:21:50.150
what those assumptions are then you're
missing out on information and you don't

00:21:50.150 --> 00:21:50.160
missing out on information and you don't
 

00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:52.070
missing out on information and you don't
know what how much value to place only

00:21:52.070 --> 00:21:52.080
know what how much value to place only
 

00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:54.140
know what how much value to place only
on that piece of information so though

00:21:54.140 --> 00:21:54.150
on that piece of information so though
 

00:21:54.150 --> 00:21:55.880
on that piece of information so though
with open note nub of science we're

00:21:55.880 --> 00:21:55.890
with open note nub of science we're
 

00:21:55.890 --> 00:21:57.049
with open note nub of science we're
maintaining the integrity of the data

00:21:57.049 --> 00:21:57.059
maintaining the integrity of the data
 

00:21:57.059 --> 00:21:59.090
maintaining the integrity of the data
provenance by making those assumptions

00:21:59.090 --> 00:21:59.100
provenance by making those assumptions
 

00:21:59.100 --> 00:22:03.560
provenance by making those assumptions
explicit so you know a very simple way

00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:03.570
explicit so you know a very simple way
 

00:22:03.570 --> 00:22:04.970
explicit so you know a very simple way
to say is we're going from model of

00:22:04.970 --> 00:22:04.980
to say is we're going from model of
 

00:22:04.980 --> 00:22:08.510
to say is we're going from model of
trust to one of proof so if we see a

00:22:08.510 --> 00:22:08.520
trust to one of proof so if we see a
 

00:22:08.520 --> 00:22:11.299
trust to one of proof so if we see a
paper I know now in science we basically

00:22:11.299 --> 00:22:11.309
paper I know now in science we basically
 

00:22:11.309 --> 00:22:12.770
paper I know now in science we basically
see well you know which which grew

00:22:12.770 --> 00:22:12.780
see well you know which which grew
 

00:22:12.780 --> 00:22:14.360
see well you know which which grew
published this I know that they've been

00:22:14.360 --> 00:22:14.370
published this I know that they've been
 

00:22:14.370 --> 00:22:16.549
published this I know that they've been
reliable in the past you know there's

00:22:16.549 --> 00:22:16.559
reliable in the past you know there's
 

00:22:16.559 --> 00:22:18.110
reliable in the past you know there's
really no reason for that I mean I think

00:22:18.110 --> 00:22:18.120
really no reason for that I mean I think
 

00:22:18.120 --> 00:22:20.390
really no reason for that I mean I think
that we have the tools right now there

00:22:20.390 --> 00:22:20.400
that we have the tools right now there
 

00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:22.490
that we have the tools right now there
was a time when paper was scarce it was

00:22:22.490 --> 00:22:22.500
was a time when paper was scarce it was
 

00:22:22.500 --> 00:22:23.990
was a time when paper was scarce it was
difficult to publish everything but now

00:22:23.990 --> 00:22:24.000
difficult to publish everything but now
 

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:25.700
difficult to publish everything but now
we actually can communicate all this

00:22:25.700 --> 00:22:25.710
we actually can communicate all this
 

00:22:25.710 --> 00:22:27.890
we actually can communicate all this
information and into the experimental

00:22:27.890 --> 00:22:27.900
information and into the experimental
 

00:22:27.900 --> 00:22:29.540
information and into the experimental
sciences what you want actually is the

00:22:29.540 --> 00:22:29.550
sciences what you want actually is the
 

00:22:29.550 --> 00:22:31.040
sciences what you want actually is the
lab notebook because that is the

00:22:31.040 --> 00:22:31.050
lab notebook because that is the
 

00:22:31.050 --> 00:22:34.700
lab notebook because that is the
absolute best record that the researcher

00:22:34.700 --> 00:22:34.710
absolute best record that the researcher
 

00:22:34.710 --> 00:22:36.980
absolute best record that the researcher
is recording so that they themselves can

00:22:36.980 --> 00:22:36.990
is recording so that they themselves can
 

00:22:36.990 --> 00:22:39.470
is recording so that they themselves can
repeat their own experiments let me give

00:22:39.470 --> 00:22:39.480
repeat their own experiments let me give
 

00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:41.510
repeat their own experiments let me give
you a concrete example of how that can

00:22:41.510 --> 00:22:41.520
you a concrete example of how that can
 

00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:43.250
you a concrete example of how that can
be used so i'll be talking about

00:22:43.250 --> 00:22:43.260
be used so i'll be talking about
 

00:22:43.260 --> 00:22:45.110
be used so i'll be talking about
solubility throughout my talk and i'll

00:22:45.110 --> 00:22:45.120
solubility throughout my talk and i'll
 

00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:46.760
solubility throughout my talk and i'll
i'll give you a reason why a little bit

00:22:46.760 --> 00:22:46.770
i'll give you a reason why a little bit
 

00:22:46.770 --> 00:22:48.950
i'll give you a reason why a little bit
later but right now let's say that we

00:22:48.950 --> 00:22:48.960
later but right now let's say that we
 

00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:50.720
later but right now let's say that we
have this this table right and we have

00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:50.730
have this this table right and we have
 

00:22:50.730 --> 00:22:53.450
have this this table right and we have
all these data points so this is a

00:22:53.450 --> 00:22:53.460
all these data points so this is a
 

00:22:53.460 --> 00:22:55.040
all these data points so this is a
solubility of these different compounds

00:22:55.040 --> 00:22:55.050
solubility of these different compounds
 

00:22:55.050 --> 00:22:57.410
solubility of these different compounds
in chloroform and as a chemist something

00:22:57.410 --> 00:22:57.420
in chloroform and as a chemist something
 

00:22:57.420 --> 00:22:59.120
in chloroform and as a chemist something
looks really weird to me because these

00:22:59.120 --> 00:22:59.130
looks really weird to me because these
 

00:22:59.130 --> 00:23:01.040
looks really weird to me because these
compounds are really similar to each

00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:01.050
compounds are really similar to each
 

00:23:01.050 --> 00:23:03.380
compounds are really similar to each
other however one of the numbers is

00:23:03.380 --> 00:23:03.390
other however one of the numbers is
 

00:23:03.390 --> 00:23:05.660
other however one of the numbers is
extremely low point 07 where all the old

00:23:05.660 --> 00:23:05.670
extremely low point 07 where all the old
 

00:23:05.670 --> 00:23:09.470
extremely low point 07 where all the old
ones are at least 1.75 so if this were

00:23:09.470 --> 00:23:09.480
ones are at least 1.75 so if this were
 

00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:11.660
ones are at least 1.75 so if this were
if this we're at a table in a journal

00:23:11.660 --> 00:23:11.670
if this we're at a table in a journal
 

00:23:11.670 --> 00:23:13.790
if this we're at a table in a journal
what can you do really all you have to

00:23:13.790 --> 00:23:13.800
what can you do really all you have to
 

00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:15.470
what can you do really all you have to
do is say well I guess it's an anomalous

00:23:15.470 --> 00:23:15.480
do is say well I guess it's an anomalous
 

00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:18.169
do is say well I guess it's an anomalous
compound well with open notebook science

00:23:18.169 --> 00:23:18.179
compound well with open notebook science
 

00:23:18.179 --> 00:23:19.820
compound well with open notebook science
you can actually ask the question what

00:23:19.820 --> 00:23:19.830
you can actually ask the question what
 

00:23:19.830 --> 00:23:21.470
you can actually ask the question what
is wrong with that particular number so

00:23:21.470 --> 00:23:21.480
is wrong with that particular number so
 

00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:23.780
is wrong with that particular number so
I will dig in to see how that it

00:23:23.780 --> 00:23:23.790
I will dig in to see how that it
 

00:23:23.790 --> 00:23:25.670
I will dig in to see how that it
measurement was actually made so

00:23:25.670 --> 00:23:25.680
measurement was actually made so
 

00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:27.950
measurement was actually made so
it turned out that that was incorrectly

00:23:27.950 --> 00:23:27.960
it turned out that that was incorrectly
 

00:23:27.960 --> 00:23:29.840
it turned out that that was incorrectly
was reassured at 3.6 which makes a lot

00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:29.850
was reassured at 3.6 which makes a lot
 

00:23:29.850 --> 00:23:31.580
was reassured at 3.6 which makes a lot
more sense but let's see how I could

00:23:31.580 --> 00:23:31.590
more sense but let's see how I could
 

00:23:31.590 --> 00:23:32.780
more sense but let's see how I could
actually figure out that there was a

00:23:32.780 --> 00:23:32.790
actually figure out that there was a
 

00:23:32.790 --> 00:23:35.930
actually figure out that there was a
problem so if I go to the actual lab

00:23:35.930 --> 00:23:35.940
problem so if I go to the actual lab
 

00:23:35.940 --> 00:23:37.310
problem so if I go to the actual lab
notebook page where that measurement was

00:23:37.310 --> 00:23:37.320
notebook page where that measurement was
 

00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:39.590
notebook page where that measurement was
made you see here in green is

00:23:39.590 --> 00:23:39.600
made you see here in green is
 

00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:41.780
made you see here in green is
highlighted that at nine-thirty they

00:23:41.780 --> 00:23:41.790
highlighted that at nine-thirty they
 

00:23:41.790 --> 00:23:44.030
highlighted that at nine-thirty they
placed the the violin the speed back and

00:23:44.030 --> 00:23:44.040
placed the the violin the speed back and
 

00:23:44.040 --> 00:23:45.980
placed the the violin the speed back and
they removed it at three-thirty so it

00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:45.990
they removed it at three-thirty so it
 

00:23:45.990 --> 00:23:48.440
they removed it at three-thirty so it
spent six hours under a high vacuum and

00:23:48.440 --> 00:23:48.450
spent six hours under a high vacuum and
 

00:23:48.450 --> 00:23:50.780
spent six hours under a high vacuum and
I know that that's enough to evaporate

00:23:50.780 --> 00:23:50.790
I know that that's enough to evaporate
 

00:23:50.790 --> 00:23:52.550
I know that that's enough to evaporate
the compound that we were just talking

00:23:52.550 --> 00:23:52.560
the compound that we were just talking
 

00:23:52.560 --> 00:23:54.590
the compound that we were just talking
about the other thing you'll notice is

00:23:54.590 --> 00:23:54.600
about the other thing you'll notice is
 

00:23:54.600 --> 00:23:56.390
about the other thing you'll notice is
that they did not record the vacuum

00:23:56.390 --> 00:23:56.400
that they did not record the vacuum
 

00:23:56.400 --> 00:23:58.580
that they did not record the vacuum
pressure they did not record the time

00:23:58.580 --> 00:23:58.590
pressure they did not record the time
 

00:23:58.590 --> 00:24:01.310
pressure they did not record the time
they've or text so it's actually just as

00:24:01.310 --> 00:24:01.320
they've or text so it's actually just as
 

00:24:01.320 --> 00:24:04.340
they've or text so it's actually just as
important to know what the the

00:24:04.340 --> 00:24:04.350
important to know what the the
 

00:24:04.350 --> 00:24:06.590
important to know what the the
researcher did not measure as it is then

00:24:06.590 --> 00:24:06.600
researcher did not measure as it is then
 

00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:08.270
researcher did not measure as it is then
simply to assume that they did a great

00:24:08.270 --> 00:24:08.280
simply to assume that they did a great
 

00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:10.220
simply to assume that they did a great
job and they did you know take care of

00:24:10.220 --> 00:24:10.230
job and they did you know take care of
 

00:24:10.230 --> 00:24:12.410
job and they did you know take care of
every parameter so this is the kind of

00:24:12.410 --> 00:24:12.420
every parameter so this is the kind of
 

00:24:12.420 --> 00:24:13.760
every parameter so this is the kind of
thing that we want to resolve with open

00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:13.770
thing that we want to resolve with open
 

00:24:13.770 --> 00:24:16.490
thing that we want to resolve with open
notebook science so there's a lot of

00:24:16.490 --> 00:24:16.500
notebook science so there's a lot of
 

00:24:16.500 --> 00:24:18.650
notebook science so there's a lot of
parts of this just to give you a couple

00:24:18.650 --> 00:24:18.660
parts of this just to give you a couple
 

00:24:18.660 --> 00:24:20.720
parts of this just to give you a couple
of examples the other thing is that we

00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:20.730
of examples the other thing is that we
 

00:24:20.730 --> 00:24:22.310
of examples the other thing is that we
can make the rationale the findings

00:24:22.310 --> 00:24:22.320
can make the rationale the findings
 

00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:24.350
can make the rationale the findings
explicit so I show you the log portion

00:24:24.350 --> 00:24:24.360
explicit so I show you the log portion
 

00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:25.970
explicit so I show you the log portion
which is where the researcher records

00:24:25.970 --> 00:24:25.980
which is where the researcher records
 

00:24:25.980 --> 00:24:27.530
which is where the researcher records
what they do and what they observe and

00:24:27.530 --> 00:24:27.540
what they do and what they observe and
 

00:24:27.540 --> 00:24:29.630
what they do and what they observe and
then they have to make sense of it right

00:24:29.630 --> 00:24:29.640
then they have to make sense of it right
 

00:24:29.640 --> 00:24:31.790
then they have to make sense of it right
and so here you know you can see what

00:24:31.790 --> 00:24:31.800
and so here you know you can see what
 

00:24:31.800 --> 00:24:34.010
and so here you know you can see what
this particular research thought and why

00:24:34.010 --> 00:24:34.020
this particular research thought and why
 

00:24:34.020 --> 00:24:35.330
this particular research thought and why
they're making the conclusions that they

00:24:35.330 --> 00:24:35.340
they're making the conclusions that they
 

00:24:35.340 --> 00:24:37.100
they're making the conclusions that they
are and they're linking to raw data and

00:24:37.100 --> 00:24:37.110
are and they're linking to raw data and
 

00:24:37.110 --> 00:24:38.420
are and they're linking to raw data and
there and there you know presenting

00:24:38.420 --> 00:24:38.430
there and there you know presenting
 

00:24:38.430 --> 00:24:41.720
there and there you know presenting
evidence and the kind of raw data as

00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:41.730
evidence and the kind of raw data as
 

00:24:41.730 --> 00:24:43.760
evidence and the kind of raw data as
Boris said we're not limited anymore

00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:43.770
Boris said we're not limited anymore
 

00:24:43.770 --> 00:24:46.820
Boris said we're not limited anymore
with you know just text so taking

00:24:46.820 --> 00:24:46.830
with you know just text so taking
 

00:24:46.830 --> 00:24:49.160
with you know just text so taking
pictures or evaporated samples here's a

00:24:49.160 --> 00:24:49.170
pictures or evaporated samples here's a
 

00:24:49.170 --> 00:24:50.690
pictures or evaporated samples here's a
couple of interesting things all of

00:24:50.690 --> 00:24:50.700
couple of interesting things all of
 

00:24:50.700 --> 00:24:52.700
couple of interesting things all of
these samples after evaporation look

00:24:52.700 --> 00:24:52.710
these samples after evaporation look
 

00:24:52.710 --> 00:24:54.170
these samples after evaporation look
clean except this one looks like it

00:24:54.170 --> 00:24:54.180
clean except this one looks like it
 

00:24:54.180 --> 00:24:56.210
clean except this one looks like it
might have splattered is that important

00:24:56.210 --> 00:24:56.220
might have splattered is that important
 

00:24:56.220 --> 00:24:57.920
might have splattered is that important
I don't know but if there's if there's

00:24:57.920 --> 00:24:57.930
I don't know but if there's if there's
 

00:24:57.930 --> 00:24:58.880
I don't know but if there's if there's
an issue with this particular

00:24:58.880 --> 00:24:58.890
an issue with this particular
 

00:24:58.890 --> 00:25:01.430
an issue with this particular
measurement I probably would want to see

00:25:01.430 --> 00:25:01.440
measurement I probably would want to see
 

00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:03.110
measurement I probably would want to see
that done again if there's not an issue

00:25:03.110 --> 00:25:03.120
that done again if there's not an issue
 

00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:04.970
that done again if there's not an issue
with it it might stay there for two or

00:25:04.970 --> 00:25:04.980
with it it might stay there for two or
 

00:25:04.980 --> 00:25:06.410
with it it might stay there for two or
three years and put you know until we

00:25:06.410 --> 00:25:06.420
three years and put you know until we
 

00:25:06.420 --> 00:25:07.640
three years and put you know until we
figure it out but the point is is that

00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:07.650
figure it out but the point is is that
 

00:25:07.650 --> 00:25:09.380
figure it out but the point is is that
it's available to anyone who wants

00:25:09.380 --> 00:25:09.390
it's available to anyone who wants
 

00:25:09.390 --> 00:25:11.480
it's available to anyone who wants
access to it you'll notice also the

00:25:11.480 --> 00:25:11.490
access to it you'll notice also the
 

00:25:11.490 --> 00:25:13.040
access to it you'll notice also the
sample on the left has a little bit of

00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:13.050
sample on the left has a little bit of
 

00:25:13.050 --> 00:25:15.290
sample on the left has a little bit of
liquid in it turns out that that's not

00:25:15.290 --> 00:25:15.300
liquid in it turns out that that's not
 

00:25:15.300 --> 00:25:17.690
liquid in it turns out that that's not
actually a very important contribution

00:25:17.690 --> 00:25:17.700
actually a very important contribution
 

00:25:17.700 --> 00:25:19.490
actually a very important contribution
to error but it's still really good to

00:25:19.490 --> 00:25:19.500
to error but it's still really good to
 

00:25:19.500 --> 00:25:22.520
to error but it's still really good to
know about it if you see a problem other

00:25:22.520 --> 00:25:22.530
know about it if you see a problem other
 

00:25:22.530 --> 00:25:24.260
know about it if you see a problem other
kinds of raw data bar I'd mentioned

00:25:24.260 --> 00:25:24.270
kinds of raw data bar I'd mentioned
 

00:25:24.270 --> 00:25:27.620
kinds of raw data bar I'd mentioned
video I love video because for exactly

00:25:27.620 --> 00:25:27.630
video I love video because for exactly
 

00:25:27.630 --> 00:25:28.850
video I love video because for exactly
the reason that you mentioned is that

00:25:28.850 --> 00:25:28.860
the reason that you mentioned is that
 

00:25:28.860 --> 00:25:30.320
the reason that you mentioned is that
even if the student is recording an

00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:30.330
even if the student is recording an
 

00:25:30.330 --> 00:25:31.970
even if the student is recording an
experiment they don't necessarily know

00:25:31.970 --> 00:25:31.980
experiment they don't necessarily know
 

00:25:31.980 --> 00:25:34.490
experiment they don't necessarily know
what to note down and with the video you

00:25:34.490 --> 00:25:34.500
what to note down and with the video you
 

00:25:34.500 --> 00:25:37.640
what to note down and with the video you
can take 15 seconds just you know record

00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:37.650
can take 15 seconds just you know record
 

00:25:37.650 --> 00:25:38.419
can take 15 seconds just you know record
what

00:25:38.419 --> 00:25:38.429
what
 

00:25:38.429 --> 00:25:40.539
what
in the experiment the whole set up and

00:25:40.539 --> 00:25:40.549
in the experiment the whole set up and
 

00:25:40.549 --> 00:25:43.340
in the experiment the whole set up and
post it on YouTube and I can see where

00:25:43.340 --> 00:25:43.350
post it on YouTube and I can see where
 

00:25:43.350 --> 00:25:45.739
post it on YouTube and I can see where
the thermometer is and that's that could

00:25:45.739 --> 00:25:45.749
the thermometer is and that's that could
 

00:25:45.749 --> 00:25:47.299
the thermometer is and that's that could
be an issue maybe that the longer wasn't

00:25:47.299 --> 00:25:47.309
be an issue maybe that the longer wasn't
 

00:25:47.309 --> 00:25:49.249
be an issue maybe that the longer wasn't
in the solution and then you know with

00:25:49.249 --> 00:25:49.259
in the solution and then you know with
 

00:25:49.259 --> 00:25:50.119
in the solution and then you know with
the measurements what do they mean

00:25:50.119 --> 00:25:50.129
the measurements what do they mean
 

00:25:50.129 --> 00:25:54.649
the measurements what do they mean
changes so I love video another thing

00:25:54.649 --> 00:25:54.659
changes so I love video another thing
 

00:25:54.659 --> 00:25:57.169
changes so I love video another thing
that we use quite extensively our google

00:25:57.169 --> 00:25:57.179
that we use quite extensively our google
 

00:25:57.179 --> 00:25:59.840
that we use quite extensively our google
spreadsheets so these are documents that

00:25:59.840 --> 00:25:59.850
spreadsheets so these are documents that
 

00:25:59.850 --> 00:26:02.359
spreadsheets so these are documents that
are you know totally free totally

00:26:02.359 --> 00:26:02.369
are you know totally free totally
 

00:26:02.369 --> 00:26:05.869

available 21 and people can share and

00:26:05.869 --> 00:26:05.879
available 21 and people can share and
 

00:26:05.879 --> 00:26:07.220
available 21 and people can share and
they can add information that can

00:26:07.220 --> 00:26:07.230
they can add information that can
 

00:26:07.230 --> 00:26:09.109
they can add information that can
comment and the really nice thing is

00:26:09.109 --> 00:26:09.119
comment and the really nice thing is
 

00:26:09.119 --> 00:26:10.220
comment and the really nice thing is
that you can make your calculations

00:26:10.220 --> 00:26:10.230
that you can make your calculations
 

00:26:10.230 --> 00:26:12.320
that you can make your calculations
public so if there's a number and I'm

00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:12.330
public so if there's a number and I'm
 

00:26:12.330 --> 00:26:13.940
public so if there's a number and I'm
wondering what if there was a problem

00:26:13.940 --> 00:26:13.950
wondering what if there was a problem
 

00:26:13.950 --> 00:26:15.680
wondering what if there was a problem
with it the first thing i'll do is i

00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:15.690
with it the first thing i'll do is i
 

00:26:15.690 --> 00:26:17.029
with it the first thing i'll do is i
will look at the calculations in the

00:26:17.029 --> 00:26:17.039
will look at the calculations in the
 

00:26:17.039 --> 00:26:19.159
will look at the calculations in the
spreadsheet and it actually tells you

00:26:19.159 --> 00:26:19.169
spreadsheet and it actually tells you
 

00:26:19.169 --> 00:26:20.930
spreadsheet and it actually tells you
every single measurement when they

00:26:20.930 --> 00:26:20.940
every single measurement when they
 

00:26:20.940 --> 00:26:22.340
every single measurement when they
weighed the vial when they added to

00:26:22.340 --> 00:26:22.350
weighed the vial when they added to
 

00:26:22.350 --> 00:26:23.810
weighed the vial when they added to
solve and everything is so if there's

00:26:23.810 --> 00:26:23.820
solve and everything is so if there's
 

00:26:23.820 --> 00:26:24.739
solve and everything is so if there's
there might be an error in the

00:26:24.739 --> 00:26:24.749
there might be an error in the
 

00:26:24.749 --> 00:26:26.450
there might be an error in the
calculation maybe they use the wrong

00:26:26.450 --> 00:26:26.460
calculation maybe they use the wrong
 

00:26:26.460 --> 00:26:27.799
calculation maybe they use the wrong
molecular weight that happens all the

00:26:27.799 --> 00:26:27.809
molecular weight that happens all the
 

00:26:27.809 --> 00:26:34.009
molecular weight that happens all the
time i'm able to make a decision and the

00:26:34.009 --> 00:26:34.019
time i'm able to make a decision and the
 

00:26:34.019 --> 00:26:35.539
time i'm able to make a decision and the
google spreadsheets also has a really

00:26:35.539 --> 00:26:35.549
google spreadsheets also has a really
 

00:26:35.549 --> 00:26:37.999
google spreadsheets also has a really
nice feature it has a history so you can

00:26:37.999 --> 00:26:38.009
nice feature it has a history so you can
 

00:26:38.009 --> 00:26:39.950
nice feature it has a history so you can
actually go back to a different version

00:26:39.950 --> 00:26:39.960
actually go back to a different version
 

00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:41.869
actually go back to a different version
if somebody goes in and changes the

00:26:41.869 --> 00:26:41.879
if somebody goes in and changes the
 

00:26:41.879 --> 00:26:43.759
if somebody goes in and changes the
value you can tell that and you can you

00:26:43.759 --> 00:26:43.769
value you can tell that and you can you
 

00:26:43.769 --> 00:26:45.889
value you can tell that and you can you
can track all that it's very similar to

00:26:45.889 --> 00:26:45.899
can track all that it's very similar to
 

00:26:45.899 --> 00:26:49.310
can track all that it's very similar to
a wiki so we also use wiki pages as or

00:26:49.310 --> 00:26:49.320
a wiki so we also use wiki pages as or
 

00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:52.489
a wiki so we also use wiki pages as or
actual lab notebook and there as well

00:26:52.489 --> 00:26:52.499
actual lab notebook and there as well
 

00:26:52.499 --> 00:26:54.259
actual lab notebook and there as well
every time somebody goes in you can tell

00:26:54.259 --> 00:26:54.269
every time somebody goes in you can tell
 

00:26:54.269 --> 00:26:56.659
every time somebody goes in you can tell
who it is that came in and you can see

00:26:56.659 --> 00:26:56.669
who it is that came in and you can see
 

00:26:56.669 --> 00:26:59.409
who it is that came in and you can see
when they actually made that change and

00:26:59.409 --> 00:26:59.419
when they actually made that change and
 

00:26:59.419 --> 00:27:01.820
when they actually made that change and
so if you're if you're familiar the wiki

00:27:01.820 --> 00:27:01.830
so if you're if you're familiar the wiki
 

00:27:01.830 --> 00:27:05.930
so if you're if you're familiar the wiki
basically it's just a program that's

00:27:05.930 --> 00:27:05.940
basically it's just a program that's
 

00:27:05.940 --> 00:27:07.730
basically it's just a program that's
very easy for anyone to come in and edit

00:27:07.730 --> 00:27:07.740
very easy for anyone to come in and edit
 

00:27:07.740 --> 00:27:09.889
very easy for anyone to come in and edit
it and you have every version and what

00:27:09.889 --> 00:27:09.899
it and you have every version and what
 

00:27:09.899 --> 00:27:11.960
it and you have every version and what
you can do is compare two versions so if

00:27:11.960 --> 00:27:11.970
you can do is compare two versions so if
 

00:27:11.970 --> 00:27:14.090
you can do is compare two versions so if
we compare one version with the other I

00:27:14.090 --> 00:27:14.100
we compare one version with the other I
 

00:27:14.100 --> 00:27:15.919
we compare one version with the other I
can see in the green here this is the

00:27:15.919 --> 00:27:15.929
can see in the green here this is the
 

00:27:15.929 --> 00:27:17.720
can see in the green here this is the
new stuff that was added and the red

00:27:17.720 --> 00:27:17.730
new stuff that was added and the red
 

00:27:17.730 --> 00:27:19.879
new stuff that was added and the red
that's the stuff that was deleted so in

00:27:19.879 --> 00:27:19.889
that's the stuff that was deleted so in
 

00:27:19.889 --> 00:27:21.379
that's the stuff that was deleted so in
this particular case this was a question

00:27:21.379 --> 00:27:21.389
this particular case this was a question
 

00:27:21.389 --> 00:27:23.330
this particular case this was a question
that I asked to the student and when

00:27:23.330 --> 00:27:23.340
that I asked to the student and when
 

00:27:23.340 --> 00:27:25.190
that I asked to the student and when
they answered it they deleted my

00:27:25.190 --> 00:27:25.200
they answered it they deleted my
 

00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:26.779
they answered it they deleted my
question so that's actually a very good

00:27:26.779 --> 00:27:26.789
question so that's actually a very good
 

00:27:26.789 --> 00:27:29.060
question so that's actually a very good
way to interact with with students

00:27:29.060 --> 00:27:29.070
way to interact with with students
 

00:27:29.070 --> 00:27:30.350
way to interact with with students
because you know you can pinpoint

00:27:30.350 --> 00:27:30.360
because you know you can pinpoint
 

00:27:30.360 --> 00:27:32.960
because you know you can pinpoint
exactly ask them a question and it's a

00:27:32.960 --> 00:27:32.970
exactly ask them a question and it's a
 

00:27:32.970 --> 00:27:36.980
exactly ask them a question and it's a
great way to teach science there's so

00:27:36.980 --> 00:27:36.990
great way to teach science there's so
 

00:27:36.990 --> 00:27:38.210
great way to teach science there's so
much more that we can do with our

00:27:38.210 --> 00:27:38.220
much more that we can do with our
 

00:27:38.220 --> 00:27:41.330
much more that we can do with our
technology there is a format called J

00:27:41.330 --> 00:27:41.340
technology there is a format called J
 

00:27:41.340 --> 00:27:43.909
technology there is a format called J
camp DX and that will represent any

00:27:43.909 --> 00:27:43.919
camp DX and that will represent any
 

00:27:43.919 --> 00:27:45.919
camp DX and that will represent any
spectral information that you can plot

00:27:45.919 --> 00:27:45.929
spectral information that you can plot
 

00:27:45.929 --> 00:27:48.799
spectral information that you can plot
on an XY axis and what you

00:27:48.799 --> 00:27:48.809
on an XY axis and what you
 

00:27:48.809 --> 00:27:51.350
on an XY axis and what you
can do is use J spec view which is a

00:27:51.350 --> 00:27:51.360
can do is use J spec view which is a
 

00:27:51.360 --> 00:27:54.350
can do is use J spec view which is a
free Java program and you can just

00:27:54.350 --> 00:27:54.360
free Java program and you can just
 

00:27:54.360 --> 00:27:57.019
free Java program and you can just
expand any area of the spectrum to zoom

00:27:57.019 --> 00:27:57.029
expand any area of the spectrum to zoom
 

00:27:57.029 --> 00:27:59.360
expand any area of the spectrum to zoom
in to see the fine details this is

00:27:59.360 --> 00:27:59.370
in to see the fine details this is
 

00:27:59.370 --> 00:28:01.369
in to see the fine details this is
actually really important this is an NMR

00:28:01.369 --> 00:28:01.379
actually really important this is an NMR
 

00:28:01.379 --> 00:28:03.980
actually really important this is an NMR
spectrum and what this shows me down

00:28:03.980 --> 00:28:03.990
spectrum and what this shows me down
 

00:28:03.990 --> 00:28:05.299
spectrum and what this shows me down
here is that there are actually

00:28:05.299 --> 00:28:05.309
here is that there are actually
 

00:28:05.309 --> 00:28:07.460
here is that there are actually
impurities in the sample and oftentimes

00:28:07.460 --> 00:28:07.470
impurities in the sample and oftentimes
 

00:28:07.470 --> 00:28:09.950
impurities in the sample and oftentimes
when you submit to a journal you give

00:28:09.950 --> 00:28:09.960
when you submit to a journal you give
 

00:28:09.960 --> 00:28:12.529
when you submit to a journal you give
them a PDF and you can't always see

00:28:12.529 --> 00:28:12.539
them a PDF and you can't always see
 

00:28:12.539 --> 00:28:14.869
them a PDF and you can't always see
exactly where the impurities are our how

00:28:14.869 --> 00:28:14.879
exactly where the impurities are our how
 

00:28:14.879 --> 00:28:16.489
exactly where the impurities are our how
much there are so this is really nice

00:28:16.489 --> 00:28:16.499
much there are so this is really nice
 

00:28:16.499 --> 00:28:18.049
much there are so this is really nice
because you know you don't have to rely

00:28:18.049 --> 00:28:18.059
because you know you don't have to rely
 

00:28:18.059 --> 00:28:20.450
because you know you don't have to rely

chemists that we can use chemspider is
 

00:28:34.919 --> 00:28:37.730
chemists that we can use chemspider is
one where basically it's a very large

00:28:37.730 --> 00:28:37.740
one where basically it's a very large

there I can actually add my own data

00:28:44.509 --> 00:28:44.519
there I can actually add my own data
 

00:28:44.519 --> 00:28:46.730
there I can actually add my own data
like it if I measured a melting point I

00:28:46.730 --> 00:28:46.740
like it if I measured a melting point I
 

00:28:46.740 --> 00:28:49.249
like it if I measured a melting point I
can add that if I took a spectrum i can

00:28:49.249 --> 00:28:49.259
can add that if I took a spectrum i can
 

00:28:49.259 --> 00:28:52.549
can add that if I took a spectrum i can
add that and I can also do substructure

00:28:52.549 --> 00:28:52.559
add that and I can also do substructure
 

00:28:52.559 --> 00:28:54.950
add that and I can also do substructure
searches with in chemspider so instead

00:28:54.950 --> 00:28:54.960
searches with in chemspider so instead
 

00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:56.600
searches with in chemspider so instead
of me having to worry about getting a

00:28:56.600 --> 00:28:56.610
of me having to worry about getting a
 

00:28:56.610 --> 00:28:59.690
of me having to worry about getting a
programmer on my server you know to have

00:28:59.690 --> 00:28:59.700
programmer on my server you know to have
 

00:28:59.700 --> 00:29:02.060
programmer on my server you know to have
my own customized applications for for

00:29:02.060 --> 00:29:02.070
my own customized applications for for
 

00:29:02.070 --> 00:29:03.859
my own customized applications for for
searching the compounds in my lab all I

00:29:03.859 --> 00:29:03.869
searching the compounds in my lab all I
 

00:29:03.869 --> 00:29:05.810
searching the compounds in my lab all I
can do is just put it in chemspider and

00:29:05.810 --> 00:29:05.820
can do is just put it in chemspider and
 

00:29:05.820 --> 00:29:08.570
can do is just put it in chemspider and
let their the experts in storing

00:29:08.570 --> 00:29:08.580
let their the experts in storing
 

00:29:08.580 --> 00:29:10.430
let their the experts in storing
chemical information let them worry

00:29:10.430 --> 00:29:10.440
chemical information let them worry
 

00:29:10.440 --> 00:29:12.529
chemical information let them worry
about all that stuff and again this is a

00:29:12.529 --> 00:29:12.539
about all that stuff and again this is a
 

00:29:12.539 --> 00:29:14.509
about all that stuff and again this is a
free service that's that's very very

00:29:14.509 --> 00:29:14.519
free service that's that's very very
 

00:29:14.519 --> 00:29:17.330
free service that's that's very very
useful to us as I said we can we can

00:29:17.330 --> 00:29:17.340
useful to us as I said we can we can
 

00:29:17.340 --> 00:29:20.539
useful to us as I said we can we can
upload data we've also started to upload

00:29:20.539 --> 00:29:20.549
upload data we've also started to upload
 

00:29:20.549 --> 00:29:22.310
upload data we've also started to upload
these non equus all ability measurements

00:29:22.310 --> 00:29:22.320
these non equus all ability measurements
 

00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:23.960
these non equus all ability measurements
so there's all kinds of things you can

00:29:23.960 --> 00:29:23.970
so there's all kinds of things you can
 

00:29:23.970 --> 00:29:26.869
so there's all kinds of things you can
do now when you upload a spectrum in

00:29:26.869 --> 00:29:26.879
do now when you upload a spectrum in
 

00:29:26.879 --> 00:29:28.850
do now when you upload a spectrum in
chemspider it asks you if you want to

00:29:28.850 --> 00:29:28.860
chemspider it asks you if you want to
 

00:29:28.860 --> 00:29:31.310
chemspider it asks you if you want to
make it open data or not and I think a

00:29:31.310 --> 00:29:31.320
make it open data or not and I think a
 

00:29:31.320 --> 00:29:32.480
make it open data or not and I think a
lot of people when they first see that

00:29:32.480 --> 00:29:32.490
lot of people when they first see that
 

00:29:32.490 --> 00:29:34.159
lot of people when they first see that
question might not realize what's the

00:29:34.159 --> 00:29:34.169
question might not realize what's the
 

00:29:34.169 --> 00:29:36.019
question might not realize what's the
difference and why it's important this

00:29:36.019 --> 00:29:36.029
difference and why it's important this
 

00:29:36.029 --> 00:29:37.909
difference and why it's important this
is the reason because what we've been

00:29:37.909 --> 00:29:37.919
is the reason because what we've been
 

00:29:37.919 --> 00:29:40.129
is the reason because what we've been
doing now is is took all of the open

00:29:40.129 --> 00:29:40.139
doing now is is took all of the open
 

00:29:40.139 --> 00:29:42.019
doing now is is took all of the open
data spectrum and we made a game out of

00:29:42.019 --> 00:29:42.029
data spectrum and we made a game out of
 

00:29:42.029 --> 00:29:44.509
data spectrum and we made a game out of
it we have actually a thousand spectra

00:29:44.509 --> 00:29:44.519
it we have actually a thousand spectra
 

00:29:44.519 --> 00:29:47.359
it we have actually a thousand spectra
that basically you have a spectrum

00:29:47.359 --> 00:29:47.369
that basically you have a spectrum
 

00:29:47.369 --> 00:29:48.980
that basically you have a spectrum
that's given to you and you've got three

00:29:48.980 --> 00:29:48.990
that's given to you and you've got three
 

00:29:48.990 --> 00:29:50.779
that's given to you and you've got three
molecules this is a collaboration with

00:29:50.779 --> 00:29:50.789
molecules this is a collaboration with
 

00:29:50.789 --> 00:29:51.980
molecules this is a collaboration with
Andy Lang and tony williams from

00:29:51.980 --> 00:29:51.990
Andy Lang and tony williams from
 

00:29:51.990 --> 00:29:54.889
Andy Lang and tony williams from
chemspider and basically you just keep

00:29:54.889 --> 00:29:54.899
chemspider and basically you just keep
 

00:29:54.899 --> 00:29:57.470
chemspider and basically you just keep
clicking on the right molecule until you

00:29:57.470 --> 00:29:57.480
clicking on the right molecule until you
 

00:29:57.480 --> 00:30:00.259
clicking on the right molecule until you
get one wrong so I'm actually giving a

00:30:00.259 --> 00:30:00.269
get one wrong so I'm actually giving a
 

00:30:00.269 --> 00:30:00.850
get one wrong so I'm actually giving a
prize right

00:30:00.850 --> 00:30:00.860
prize right
 

00:30:00.860 --> 00:30:02.710
prize right
now to the first student to reach 100

00:30:02.710 --> 00:30:02.720
now to the first student to reach 100
 

00:30:02.720 --> 00:30:03.940
now to the first student to reach 100
points it's actually a pretty hard game

00:30:03.940 --> 00:30:03.950
points it's actually a pretty hard game
 

00:30:03.950 --> 00:30:07.630
points it's actually a pretty hard game
and these this is what open data means

00:30:07.630 --> 00:30:07.640
and these this is what open data means
 

00:30:07.640 --> 00:30:09.669
and these this is what open data means
it's the difference between this and

00:30:09.669 --> 00:30:09.679
it's the difference between this and
 

00:30:09.679 --> 00:30:11.860
it's the difference between this and
nothing at all it's very important to

00:30:11.860 --> 00:30:11.870
nothing at all it's very important to
 

00:30:11.870 --> 00:30:13.120
nothing at all it's very important to
think about it is very important to

00:30:13.120 --> 00:30:13.130
think about it is very important to
 

00:30:13.130 --> 00:30:15.520
think about it is very important to
think about how maybe someone wants to

00:30:15.520 --> 00:30:15.530
think about how maybe someone wants to
 

00:30:15.530 --> 00:30:17.049
think about how maybe someone wants to
use your data in a way that you have

00:30:17.049 --> 00:30:17.059
use your data in a way that you have
 

00:30:17.059 --> 00:30:18.640
use your data in a way that you have
never imagined and don't even want to be

00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:18.650
never imagined and don't even want to be
 

00:30:18.650 --> 00:30:20.590
never imagined and don't even want to be
bothered with but it's really important

00:30:20.590 --> 00:30:20.600
bothered with but it's really important
 

00:30:20.600 --> 00:30:21.820
bothered with but it's really important
because you know really useful things

00:30:21.820 --> 00:30:21.830
because you know really useful things
 

00:30:21.830 --> 00:30:24.310
because you know really useful things
can be done and we've also implemented

00:30:24.310 --> 00:30:24.320
can be done and we've also implemented
 

00:30:24.320 --> 00:30:27.100
can be done and we've also implemented
this in the Second Life don't have a lot

00:30:27.100 --> 00:30:27.110
this in the Second Life don't have a lot
 

00:30:27.110 --> 00:30:28.090
this in the Second Life don't have a lot
of time to talk about this but if

00:30:28.090 --> 00:30:28.100
of time to talk about this but if
 

00:30:28.100 --> 00:30:29.620
of time to talk about this but if
anybody is interested I've actually

00:30:29.620 --> 00:30:29.630
anybody is interested I've actually
 

00:30:29.630 --> 00:30:31.330
anybody is interested I've actually
removed most of my second life slides

00:30:31.330 --> 00:30:31.340
removed most of my second life slides
 

00:30:31.340 --> 00:30:33.010
removed most of my second life slides
because of time constraints but you know

00:30:33.010 --> 00:30:33.020
because of time constraints but you know
 

00:30:33.020 --> 00:30:35.560
because of time constraints but you know
I'd be happy to talk to you about it ok

00:30:35.560 --> 00:30:35.570
I'd be happy to talk to you about it ok
 

00:30:35.570 --> 00:30:37.750
I'd be happy to talk to you about it ok
so let's take this to another level I've

00:30:37.750 --> 00:30:37.760
so let's take this to another level I've
 

00:30:37.760 --> 00:30:39.250
so let's take this to another level I've
just shown you what happens if you have

00:30:39.250 --> 00:30:39.260
just shown you what happens if you have
 

00:30:39.260 --> 00:30:42.630
just shown you what happens if you have
one group that's recording their work

00:30:42.630 --> 00:30:42.640
one group that's recording their work
 

00:30:42.640 --> 00:30:44.710
one group that's recording their work
what happens if you take this to the

00:30:44.710 --> 00:30:44.720
what happens if you take this to the
 

00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:46.000
what happens if you take this to the
next level and you actually starts to

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:46.010
next level and you actually starts to
 

00:30:46.010 --> 00:30:47.770
next level and you actually starts to
crowdsource it and that's exactly what

00:30:47.770 --> 00:30:47.780
crowdsource it and that's exactly what
 

00:30:47.780 --> 00:30:51.640
crowdsource it and that's exactly what
we've done with solubility so in the in

00:30:51.640 --> 00:30:51.650
we've done with solubility so in the in
 

00:30:51.650 --> 00:30:54.760
we've done with solubility so in the in
the fall last year started this open

00:30:54.760 --> 00:30:54.770
the fall last year started this open
 

00:30:54.770 --> 00:30:56.320
the fall last year started this open
notebook science challenge and the idea

00:30:56.320 --> 00:30:56.330
notebook science challenge and the idea
 

00:30:56.330 --> 00:30:58.360
notebook science challenge and the idea
is very simple it's just invite anyone

00:30:58.360 --> 00:30:58.370
is very simple it's just invite anyone
 

00:30:58.370 --> 00:31:01.120
is very simple it's just invite anyone
in the world to take a compound pick an

00:31:01.120 --> 00:31:01.130
in the world to take a compound pick an
 

00:31:01.130 --> 00:31:03.039
in the world to take a compound pick an
organic solvent and report the

00:31:03.039 --> 00:31:03.049
organic solvent and report the
 

00:31:03.049 --> 00:31:05.230
organic solvent and report the
solubility it turns out that actually

00:31:05.230 --> 00:31:05.240
solubility it turns out that actually
 

00:31:05.240 --> 00:31:07.000
solubility it turns out that actually
that information you would think would

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:07.010
that information you would think would
 

00:31:07.010 --> 00:31:08.890
that information you would think would
be widely available and it's not you can

00:31:08.890 --> 00:31:08.900
be widely available and it's not you can
 

00:31:08.900 --> 00:31:11.350
be widely available and it's not you can
find aqueous solubility fairly easily

00:31:11.350 --> 00:31:11.360
find aqueous solubility fairly easily
 

00:31:11.360 --> 00:31:13.299
find aqueous solubility fairly easily
you can find the melting point of any

00:31:13.299 --> 00:31:13.309
you can find the melting point of any
 

00:31:13.309 --> 00:31:15.610
you can find the melting point of any
solid out there you can find the boiling

00:31:15.610 --> 00:31:15.620
solid out there you can find the boiling
 

00:31:15.620 --> 00:31:17.470
solid out there you can find the boiling
point there's all these properties that

00:31:17.470 --> 00:31:17.480
point there's all these properties that
 

00:31:17.480 --> 00:31:18.820
point there's all these properties that
you can find but one of the most

00:31:18.820 --> 00:31:18.830
you can find but one of the most
 

00:31:18.830 --> 00:31:20.950
you can find but one of the most
important properties which is I want to

00:31:20.950 --> 00:31:20.960
important properties which is I want to
 

00:31:20.960 --> 00:31:22.900
important properties which is I want to
do a reaction in a solvent with solvents

00:31:22.900 --> 00:31:22.910
do a reaction in a solvent with solvents
 

00:31:22.910 --> 00:31:24.490
do a reaction in a solvent with solvents
that I choose that's actually pretty

00:31:24.490 --> 00:31:24.500
that I choose that's actually pretty
 

00:31:24.500 --> 00:31:26.740
that I choose that's actually pretty
hard to define there are some some

00:31:26.740 --> 00:31:26.750
hard to define there are some some
 

00:31:26.750 --> 00:31:28.480
hard to define there are some some
measurements but you won't you won't

00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:28.490
measurements but you won't you won't
 

00:31:28.490 --> 00:31:30.340
measurements but you won't you won't
find most of them so we've got this

00:31:30.340 --> 00:31:30.350
find most of them so we've got this
 

00:31:30.350 --> 00:31:32.140
find most of them so we've got this
challenge to make this all open people

00:31:32.140 --> 00:31:32.150
challenge to make this all open people
 

00:31:32.150 --> 00:31:33.700
challenge to make this all open people

what the student does how they respond
 

00:32:37.320 --> 00:32:39.230
what the student does how they respond
to their comments and we come to a

00:32:39.230 --> 00:32:39.240

00:32:39.240 --> 00:32:41.389
to their comments and we come to a
decision as to this student you know in

00:32:41.389 --> 00:32:41.399
decision as to this student you know in
 

00:32:41.399 --> 00:32:42.950

this period of time has probably done

00:32:42.950 --> 00:32:42.960
this period of time has probably done
 

00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:45.830
this period of time has probably done
the best job so I think this is a pretty

00:32:45.830 --> 00:32:45.840
the best job so I think this is a pretty
 

00:32:45.840 --> 00:32:49.250
the best job so I think this is a pretty
good model and I've been very happy to

00:32:49.250 --> 00:32:49.260
good model and I've been very happy to
 

00:32:49.260 --> 00:32:50.990
good model and I've been very happy to
have such high quality people joined it

00:32:50.990 --> 00:32:51.000
have such high quality people joined it
 

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:54.380
have such high quality people joined it
and again what else can you do with this

00:32:54.380 --> 00:32:54.390
and again what else can you do with this
 

00:32:54.390 --> 00:32:56.360
and again what else can you do with this
was once you have a system in place is

experiments to do and he just took the

00:33:16.940 --> 00:33:16.950
experiments to do and he just took the
 

00:33:16.950 --> 00:33:19.130
experiments to do and he just took the
time to actually do a good job and ask

00:33:19.130 --> 00:33:19.140
time to actually do a good job and ask
 

00:33:19.140 --> 00:33:20.840

measure any compound in any organic
 

00:33:22.620 --> 00:33:25.220
measure any compound in any organic
solvent that they had available and so

00:33:25.220 --> 00:33:25.230
solvent that they had available and so
 

00:33:25.230 --> 00:33:27.830
solvent that they had available and so
then he he up he uploaded those those

00:33:27.830 --> 00:33:27.840
then he he up he uploaded those those
 

00:33:27.840 --> 00:33:30.049
then he he up he uploaded those those
data points and we did get some new

00:33:30.049 --> 00:33:30.059
data points and we did get some new
 

00:33:30.059 --> 00:33:31.880
data points and we did get some new
measurements so do you imagine actually

00:33:31.880 --> 00:33:31.890
measurements so do you imagine actually
 

00:33:31.890 --> 00:33:33.529
measurements so do you imagine actually
being able to leverage this across the

00:33:33.529 --> 00:33:33.539
being able to leverage this across the
 

00:33:33.539 --> 00:33:35.600
being able to leverage this across the
world you know every university has

00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:35.610

teaching labs is huge untapped potential

00:33:37.940 --> 00:33:37.950
teaching labs is huge untapped potential
 

00:33:37.950 --> 00:33:39.830
teaching labs is huge untapped potential
here it just requires the will to

00:33:39.830 --> 00:33:39.840
here it just requires the will to
 

00:33:39.840 --> 00:33:42.019
here it just requires the will to
actually implement something different

00:33:42.019 --> 00:33:42.029
actually implement something different
 

00:33:42.029 --> 00:33:44.029
actually implement something different
that you've been doing you know for the

00:33:44.029 --> 00:33:44.039
that you've been doing you know for the
 

00:33:44.039 --> 00:33:46.760
that you've been doing you know for the
past many years so how do you access the

00:33:46.760 --> 00:33:46.770
past many years so how do you access the
 

00:33:46.770 --> 00:33:48.860
past many years so how do you access the
solubility measurements well one way is

00:33:48.860 --> 00:33:48.870
solubility measurements well one way is
 

00:33:48.870 --> 00:33:50.810
solubility measurements well one way is
you know through a regular table of

00:33:50.810 --> 00:33:50.820
you know through a regular table of
 

00:33:50.820 --> 00:33:53.389
you know through a regular table of
contents that we will look just like

00:33:53.389 --> 00:33:53.399
contents that we will look just like
 

00:33:53.399 --> 00:33:55.880
contents that we will look just like
paper you can go to experiment 14 and

00:33:55.880 --> 00:33:55.890
paper you can go to experiment 14 and
 

00:33:55.890 --> 00:33:57.230
paper you can go to experiment 14 and
you know you can check you can see what

00:33:57.230 --> 00:33:57.240
you know you can check you can see what
 

00:33:57.240 --> 00:33:59.990
you know you can check you can see what
Jenny did but probably a more useful

00:33:59.990 --> 00:34:00.000
Jenny did but probably a more useful
 

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:02.060
Jenny did but probably a more useful
ways through a database interface so

00:34:02.060 --> 00:34:02.070
ways through a database interface so
 

00:34:02.070 --> 00:34:05.320
ways through a database interface so
we've used Google Spreadsheets as a

00:34:05.320 --> 00:34:05.330
we've used Google Spreadsheets as a
 

00:34:05.330 --> 00:34:07.519
we've used Google Spreadsheets as a
database and it turns out it does a

00:34:07.519 --> 00:34:07.529
database and it turns out it does a
 

00:34:07.529 --> 00:34:09.980
database and it turns out it does a
really good job so every time we have a

00:34:09.980 --> 00:34:09.990
really good job so every time we have a
 

00:34:09.990 --> 00:34:12.230
really good job so every time we have a
measurement we added to the google

00:34:12.230 --> 00:34:12.240
measurement we added to the google
 

00:34:12.240 --> 00:34:14.000
measurement we added to the google
spreadsheet and it has you know this

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:14.010
spreadsheet and it has you know this
 

00:34:14.010 --> 00:34:16.000
spreadsheet and it has you know this
table is pretty large goes on and on but

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:16.010
table is pretty large goes on and on but
 

00:34:16.010 --> 00:34:18.190
table is pretty large goes on and on but
the solvent it has information about how

00:34:18.190 --> 00:34:18.200
the solvent it has information about how
 

00:34:18.200 --> 00:34:19.899
the solvent it has information about how
to render that it has information so

00:34:19.899 --> 00:34:19.909
to render that it has information so
 

00:34:19.909 --> 00:34:21.430
to render that it has information so
that a machine knows that that's a cedar

00:34:21.430 --> 00:34:21.440
that a machine knows that that's a cedar
 

00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:25.750
that a machine knows that that's a cedar
nitrile it has the link to the notebook

00:34:25.750 --> 00:34:25.760
nitrile it has the link to the notebook
 

00:34:25.760 --> 00:34:28.750
nitrile it has the link to the notebook
and everything and Google actually has a

00:34:28.750 --> 00:34:28.760
and everything and Google actually has a
 

00:34:28.760 --> 00:34:31.180
and everything and Google actually has a
visualization API that is really nice so

00:34:31.180 --> 00:34:31.190
visualization API that is really nice so
 

00:34:31.190 --> 00:34:33.310
visualization API that is really nice so
you can actually treat a Google

00:34:33.310 --> 00:34:33.320
you can actually treat a Google
 

00:34:33.320 --> 00:34:35.560
you can actually treat a Google
spreadsheet like a real database and you

00:34:35.560 --> 00:34:35.570
spreadsheet like a real database and you
 

00:34:35.570 --> 00:34:37.840
spreadsheet like a real database and you
can do queries like any pic of solvent

00:34:37.840 --> 00:34:37.850
can do queries like any pic of solvent
 

00:34:37.850 --> 00:34:40.240
can do queries like any pic of solvent
to pick a solute or pick a solubility

00:34:40.240 --> 00:34:40.250
to pick a solute or pick a solubility
 

00:34:40.250 --> 00:34:43.240
to pick a solute or pick a solubility
range and it will return exactly what

00:34:43.240 --> 00:34:43.250
range and it will return exactly what
 

00:34:43.250 --> 00:34:44.409
range and it will return exactly what
you asked so this is actually a really

00:34:44.409 --> 00:34:44.419
you asked so this is actually a really
 

00:34:44.419 --> 00:34:47.530
you asked so this is actually a really
neat way to query this and the important

00:34:47.530 --> 00:34:47.540
neat way to query this and the important
 

00:34:47.540 --> 00:34:49.240
neat way to query this and the important
thing here is that this is live data if

00:34:49.240 --> 00:34:49.250
thing here is that this is live data if
 

00:34:49.250 --> 00:34:51.250
thing here is that this is live data if
a student does a measurement in the next

00:34:51.250 --> 00:34:51.260
a student does a measurement in the next
 

00:34:51.260 --> 00:34:53.379
a student does a measurement in the next
hour and they put it here and you do a

00:34:53.379 --> 00:34:53.389
hour and they put it here and you do a
 

00:34:53.389 --> 00:34:57.360
hour and they put it here and you do a
search later tonight this is live so

00:34:57.360 --> 00:34:57.370
search later tonight this is live so
 

00:34:57.370 --> 00:34:59.650
search later tonight this is live so
should you trust that number or not well

00:34:59.650 --> 00:34:59.660
should you trust that number or not well
 

00:34:59.660 --> 00:35:01.840
should you trust that number or not well
again it comes down to being able to go

00:35:01.840 --> 00:35:01.850
again it comes down to being able to go
 

00:35:01.850 --> 00:35:03.670
again it comes down to being able to go
all the way back through the chain of

00:35:03.670 --> 00:35:03.680
all the way back through the chain of
 

00:35:03.680 --> 00:35:06.430
all the way back through the chain of
provenance so if you look at for example

00:35:06.430 --> 00:35:06.440
provenance so if you look at for example
 

00:35:06.440 --> 00:35:09.160
provenance so if you look at for example
vandala in methanol these numbers should

00:35:09.160 --> 00:35:09.170
vandala in methanol these numbers should
 

00:35:09.170 --> 00:35:10.810
vandala in methanol these numbers should
all be the same because it's the same

00:35:10.810 --> 00:35:10.820
all be the same because it's the same
 

00:35:10.820 --> 00:35:12.250
all be the same because it's the same
compound in the same solvent but they're

00:35:12.250 --> 00:35:12.260
compound in the same solvent but they're
 

00:35:12.260 --> 00:35:14.080
compound in the same solvent but they're
not their differences so if you want to

00:35:14.080 --> 00:35:14.090
not their differences so if you want to
 

00:35:14.090 --> 00:35:15.970
not their differences so if you want to
investigated see maybe one of those

00:35:15.970 --> 00:35:15.980
investigated see maybe one of those
 

00:35:15.980 --> 00:35:18.700
investigated see maybe one of those

lab notebook page and you can go in and
 

00:35:21.560 --> 00:35:23.800

you can figure out I will include this

00:35:23.800 --> 00:35:23.810
you can figure out I will include this
 

00:35:23.810 --> 00:35:26.800
you can figure out I will include this
or I will not included and lately we've

00:35:26.800 --> 00:35:26.810
or I will not included and lately we've
 

00:35:26.810 --> 00:35:28.300

searching which is pretty cool so it

00:35:30.610 --> 00:35:30.620
searching which is pretty cool so it
 

00:35:30.620 --> 00:35:32.230
searching which is pretty cool so it
means that if i want to ask the question

00:35:32.230 --> 00:35:32.240
means that if i want to ask the question
 

00:35:32.240 --> 00:35:35.350

and so this is actually really it's it's

00:35:42.730 --> 00:35:42.740
and so this is actually really it's it's
 

00:35:42.740 --> 00:35:44.500
and so this is actually really it's it's
quite a powerful database when you think

00:35:44.500 --> 00:35:44.510
quite a powerful database when you think
 

00:35:44.510 --> 00:35:47.440
quite a powerful database when you think
about it all kinds of things we can do

00:35:47.440 --> 00:35:47.450
about it all kinds of things we can do
 

00:35:47.450 --> 00:35:49.480

said that's pretty commonly available
 

00:36:38.650 --> 00:36:41.110
said that's pretty commonly available
but now there's an entry solubility in

00:36:41.110 --> 00:36:41.120
but now there's an entry solubility in
 

00:36:41.120 --> 00:36:42.490
but now there's an entry solubility in
and then the solvents will vary

00:36:42.490 --> 00:36:42.500
and then the solvents will vary
 

00:36:42.500 --> 00:36:44.590
and then the solvents will vary
depending on what we've done but that

00:36:44.590 --> 00:36:44.600
depending on what we've done but that
 

00:36:44.600 --> 00:36:49.060

nice thing about solubility it's a
 

00:37:35.060 --> 00:37:36.880
nice thing about solubility it's a
pretty simple measurement so you know a

00:37:36.880 --> 00:37:36.890
pretty simple measurement so you know a
 

00:37:36.890 --> 00:37:38.560
pretty simple measurement so you know a
lot of it's been done 100 years ago

00:37:38.560 --> 00:37:38.570
lot of it's been done 100 years ago
 

00:37:38.570 --> 00:37:40.450
lot of it's been done 100 years ago
unfortunately they didn't finish it but

00:37:40.450 --> 00:37:40.460
unfortunately they didn't finish it but
 

00:37:40.460 --> 00:37:42.970
unfortunately they didn't finish it but
they did actually do a lot so I can

00:37:42.970 --> 00:37:42.980
they did actually do a lot so I can
 

00:37:42.980 --> 00:37:44.680
they did actually do a lot so I can
actually link I can make one of the

00:37:44.680 --> 00:37:44.690
actually link I can make one of the
 

00:37:44.690 --> 00:37:47.590
actually link I can make one of the
references just another data point mixed

00:37:47.590 --> 00:37:47.600
references just another data point mixed
 

00:37:47.600 --> 00:37:49.240

in with all the lab notebook pages so

00:37:49.240 --> 00:37:49.250
in with all the lab notebook pages so
 

00:37:49.250 --> 00:37:51.010
in with all the lab notebook pages so
now you can compare things and you can

00:37:51.010 --> 00:37:51.020
now you can compare things and you can
 

00:37:51.020 --> 00:37:53.040
now you can compare things and you can
see what's making sense and what's not

00:37:53.040 --> 00:37:53.050
see what's making sense and what's not
 

00:37:53.050 --> 00:37:55.240
see what's making sense and what's not
we also have if you also include

00:37:55.240 --> 00:37:55.250
we also have if you also include
 

00:37:55.250 --> 00:37:58.210
we also have if you also include
temperature our little this ain't and

00:37:58.210 --> 00:37:58.220
temperature our little this ain't and
 

00:37:58.220 --> 00:38:00.160
temperature our little this ain't and
allowing built this it will basically

00:38:00.160 --> 00:38:00.170
allowing built this it will basically
 

00:38:00.170 --> 00:38:02.230
allowing built this it will basically
give you the the curves of temperature

00:38:02.230 --> 00:38:02.240
give you the the curves of temperature
 

00:38:02.240 --> 00:38:04.150
give you the the curves of temperature
so this we want to do in the future once

00:38:04.150 --> 00:38:04.160
so this we want to do in the future once
 

00:38:04.160 --> 00:38:05.500
so this we want to do in the future once
we get a lot more people we want to get

00:38:05.500 --> 00:38:05.510
we get a lot more people we want to get
 

00:38:05.510 --> 00:38:06.700
we get a lot more people we want to get
you know a lot more temperature

00:38:06.700 --> 00:38:06.710
you know a lot more temperature
 

00:38:06.710 --> 00:38:09.640
you know a lot more temperature
measurements and again second life we

00:38:09.640 --> 00:38:09.650
measurements and again second life we
 

00:38:09.650 --> 00:38:11.860
measurements and again second life we
can explore solubility this is kind of a

00:38:11.860 --> 00:38:11.870
can explore solubility this is kind of a
 

00:38:11.870 --> 00:38:14.200
can explore solubility this is kind of a
neat Explorer if you click here on the

00:38:14.200 --> 00:38:14.210
neat Explorer if you click here on the
 

00:38:14.210 --> 00:38:15.730
neat Explorer if you click here on the
different aldehydes and you stand on

00:38:15.730 --> 00:38:15.740
different aldehydes and you stand on
 

00:38:15.740 --> 00:38:17.410
different aldehydes and you stand on
these it's like an elevator the higher

00:38:17.410 --> 00:38:17.420
these it's like an elevator the higher
 

00:38:17.420 --> 00:38:19.060
these it's like an elevator the higher
the solubility is higher you go you can

00:38:19.060 --> 00:38:19.070
the solubility is higher you go you can
 

00:38:19.070 --> 00:38:21.910
the solubility is higher you go you can
you can see over you know different

00:38:21.910 --> 00:38:21.920
you can see over you know different
 

00:38:21.920 --> 00:38:23.920
you can see over you know different
solvent systems where the different

00:38:23.920 --> 00:38:23.930
solvent systems where the different
 

00:38:23.930 --> 00:38:25.570
solvent systems where the different
components are going to be soluble we're

00:38:25.570 --> 00:38:25.580
components are going to be soluble we're
 

00:38:25.580 --> 00:38:27.730
components are going to be soluble we're
not going to be soluble I know a lot of

00:38:27.730 --> 00:38:27.740
not going to be soluble I know a lot of
 

00:38:27.740 --> 00:38:29.740
not going to be soluble I know a lot of
time today but that's basically the idea

00:38:29.740 --> 00:38:29.750
time today but that's basically the idea
 

00:38:29.750 --> 00:38:31.150
time today but that's basically the idea
behind this to be able to control

00:38:31.150 --> 00:38:31.160
behind this to be able to control
 

00:38:31.160 --> 00:38:32.860
behind this to be able to control
chemical reactions and control when they

00:38:32.860 --> 00:38:32.870
chemical reactions and control when they
 

00:38:32.870 --> 00:38:35.440
chemical reactions and control when they
precipitate so the better we can

00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:35.450
precipitate so the better we can
 

00:38:35.450 --> 00:38:37.810
precipitate so the better we can
visualize these things you know the be

00:38:37.810 --> 00:38:37.820
visualize these things you know the be
 

00:38:37.820 --> 00:38:40.270
visualize these things you know the be
easier the chemistry is ok I want to

00:38:40.270 --> 00:38:40.280
easier the chemistry is ok I want to
 

00:38:40.280 --> 00:38:41.599
easier the chemistry is ok I want to
talk a little bit about

00:38:41.599 --> 00:38:41.609
talk a little bit about
 

00:38:41.609 --> 00:38:43.370
talk a little bit about
this useful chem project that was

00:38:43.370 --> 00:38:43.380
this useful chem project that was
 

00:38:43.380 --> 00:38:45.829
this useful chem project that was
mentioned earlier so again this is open

00:38:45.829 --> 00:38:45.839
mentioned earlier so again this is open
 

00:38:45.839 --> 00:38:48.470
mentioned earlier so again this is open
notebook science this is prior to the

00:38:48.470 --> 00:38:48.480
notebook science this is prior to the
 

00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:50.779
notebook science this is prior to the
solubility work and the idea here is we

00:38:50.779 --> 00:38:50.789
solubility work and the idea here is we
 

00:38:50.789 --> 00:38:53.359
solubility work and the idea here is we
want to make new anti-malarial compounds

00:38:53.359 --> 00:38:53.369
want to make new anti-malarial compounds
 

00:38:53.369 --> 00:38:56.029
want to make new anti-malarial compounds
so this represents a collaboration

00:38:56.029 --> 00:38:56.039
so this represents a collaboration
 

00:38:56.039 --> 00:38:58.579
so this represents a collaboration
between computational people

00:38:58.579 --> 00:38:58.589
between computational people
 

00:38:58.589 --> 00:39:00.440
between computational people

we make them and then we ship them off

00:39:13.069 --> 00:39:13.079
we make them and then we ship them off
 

00:39:13.079 --> 00:39:16.249
we make them and then we ship them off
Phil Rosenthal UCSF does the acid as he

00:39:16.249 --> 00:39:16.259
Phil Rosenthal UCSF does the acid as he
 

00:39:16.259 --> 00:39:18.829

tests them so basically you have all the

00:39:18.829 --> 00:39:18.839
tests them so basically you have all the
 

00:39:18.839 --> 00:39:20.779
tests them so basically you have all the
three components you have the theory you

00:39:20.779 --> 00:39:20.789
three components you have the theory you
 

00:39:20.789 --> 00:39:22.609
three components you have the theory you
have the synthesis and then you have the

00:39:22.609 --> 00:39:22.619
have the synthesis and then you have the
 

00:39:22.619 --> 00:39:24.440
have the synthesis and then you have the
assays and that's really that's what you

00:39:24.440 --> 00:39:24.450
assays and that's really that's what you
 

00:39:24.450 --> 00:39:26.960
assays and that's really that's what you
need to go through a full cycle of drug

00:39:26.960 --> 00:39:26.970
need to go through a full cycle of drug
 

00:39:26.970 --> 00:39:29.479
need to go through a full cycle of drug
development and we're working on the

00:39:29.479 --> 00:39:29.489
development and we're working on the
 

00:39:29.489 --> 00:39:34.640
development and we're working on the

falsa pain to enzyme recently so the way
 

00:39:34.650 --> 00:39:35.870
falsa pain to enzyme recently so the way
that we spread these out I've already

00:39:35.870 --> 00:39:35.880
that we spread these out I've already
 

00:39:35.880 --> 00:39:36.979
that we spread these out I've already
shown you some of these components

00:39:36.979 --> 00:39:36.989
shown you some of these components
 

00:39:36.989 --> 00:39:38.930
shown you some of these components
alright I've definitely show you the

00:39:38.930 --> 00:39:38.940
alright I've definitely show you the
 

00:39:38.940 --> 00:39:42.680
alright I've definitely show you the
wiki I've shown you the google docs but

00:39:42.680 --> 00:39:42.690
wiki I've shown you the google docs but
 

00:39:42.690 --> 00:39:43.789
wiki I've shown you the google docs but
some of these other things i'm going to

00:39:43.789 --> 00:39:43.799
some of these other things i'm going to
 

00:39:43.799 --> 00:39:46.339
some of these other things i'm going to
show you in just a minute and we can

00:39:46.339 --> 00:39:46.349
show you in just a minute and we can
 

00:39:46.349 --> 00:39:49.579
show you in just a minute and we can
also use a blog right so how do we use a

00:39:49.579 --> 00:39:49.589
also use a blog right so how do we use a
 

00:39:49.589 --> 00:39:51.670
also use a blog right so how do we use a
blog well when we started this project

00:39:51.670 --> 00:39:51.680
blog well when we started this project
 

00:39:51.680 --> 00:39:55.609
blog well when we started this project
the idea was one experiment one blog

00:39:55.609 --> 00:39:55.619
the idea was one experiment one blog
 

00:39:55.619 --> 00:39:57.710
the idea was one experiment one blog
post well that really didn't work out

00:39:57.710 --> 00:39:57.720
post well that really didn't work out
 

00:39:57.720 --> 00:39:59.779
post well that really didn't work out
very well because what happens is that

00:39:59.779 --> 00:39:59.789
very well because what happens is that
 

00:39:59.789 --> 00:40:02.059
very well because what happens is that
the experiment you know keeps getting

00:40:02.059 --> 00:40:02.069
the experiment you know keeps getting
 

00:40:02.069 --> 00:40:03.829
the experiment you know keeps getting
updated and then the student writes a

00:40:03.829 --> 00:40:03.839
updated and then the student writes a
 

00:40:03.839 --> 00:40:05.839
updated and then the student writes a
discussion and then and as errors you

00:40:05.839 --> 00:40:05.849
discussion and then and as errors you
 

00:40:05.849 --> 00:40:07.819
discussion and then and as errors you
fix it so it turns out into the problem

00:40:07.819 --> 00:40:07.829
fix it so it turns out into the problem
 

00:40:07.829 --> 00:40:09.200
fix it so it turns out into the problem
with the blog post is you can change all

00:40:09.200 --> 00:40:09.210
with the blog post is you can change all
 

00:40:09.210 --> 00:40:10.819
with the blog post is you can change all
that but you can't track it so you can't

00:40:10.819 --> 00:40:10.829
that but you can't track it so you can't
 

00:40:10.829 --> 00:40:12.950
that but you can't track it so you can't
tell the things were changed so that's

00:40:12.950 --> 00:40:12.960
tell the things were changed so that's
 

00:40:12.960 --> 00:40:14.690
tell the things were changed so that's
why we shipped you know without that's

00:40:14.690 --> 00:40:14.700
why we shipped you know without that's
 

00:40:14.700 --> 00:40:17.539
why we shipped you know without that's
that's why we change to a wiki but the

00:40:17.539 --> 00:40:17.549
that's why we change to a wiki but the
 

00:40:17.549 --> 00:40:19.489
that's why we change to a wiki but the
blog is still really useful for giving

00:40:19.489 --> 00:40:19.499
blog is still really useful for giving
 

00:40:19.499 --> 00:40:21.410
blog is still really useful for giving
you know milestone information to people

00:40:21.410 --> 00:40:21.420
you know milestone information to people
 

00:40:21.420 --> 00:40:23.660
you know milestone information to people
about our project and what we do here is

00:40:23.660 --> 00:40:23.670
about our project and what we do here is
 

00:40:23.670 --> 00:40:26.710
about our project and what we do here is
we basically you know discuss something

00:40:26.710 --> 00:40:26.720
we basically you know discuss something
 

00:40:26.720 --> 00:40:30.559
we basically you know discuss something
and then we click on a link so it says

00:40:30.559 --> 00:40:30.569
and then we click on a link so it says
 

00:40:30.569 --> 00:40:33.079
and then we click on a link so it says
see experiment 150 that takes us to the

00:40:33.079 --> 00:40:33.089
see experiment 150 that takes us to the
 

00:40:33.089 --> 00:40:35.239
see experiment 150 that takes us to the
lab notebook page you've seen in this

00:40:35.239 --> 00:40:35.249
lab notebook page you've seen in this
 

00:40:35.249 --> 00:40:38.029
lab notebook page you've seen in this
format right and the one thing I didn't

00:40:38.029 --> 00:40:38.039
format right and the one thing I didn't
 

00:40:38.039 --> 00:40:40.279
format right and the one thing I didn't
show you earlier is you can show you can

00:40:40.279 --> 00:40:40.289
show you earlier is you can show you can
 

00:40:40.289 --> 00:40:41.630
show you earlier is you can show you can
actually put stuff that is not just

00:40:41.630 --> 00:40:41.640
actually put stuff that is not just
 

00:40:41.640 --> 00:40:44.059
actually put stuff that is not just
synthetic chemistry this is the docking

00:40:44.059 --> 00:40:44.069
synthetic chemistry this is the docking
 

00:40:44.069 --> 00:40:46.249
synthetic chemistry this is the docking
results that rajarshi did so you can

00:40:46.249 --> 00:40:46.259
results that rajarshi did so you can
 

00:40:46.259 --> 00:40:49.069
results that rajarshi did so you can
actually track exactly the way that

00:40:49.069 --> 00:40:49.079
actually track exactly the way that
 

00:40:49.079 --> 00:40:51.589
actually track exactly the way that
rajarshi did the calculations and if you

00:40:51.589 --> 00:40:51.599
rajarshi did the calculations and if you
 

00:40:51.599 --> 00:40:53.180
rajarshi did the calculations and if you
did it the same way you should end up

00:40:53.180 --> 00:40:53.190
did it the same way you should end up
 

00:40:53.190 --> 00:40:53.630
did it the same way you should end up
with the same

00:40:53.630 --> 00:40:53.640
with the same
 

00:40:53.640 --> 00:40:55.880
with the same
most the compounds in the same order so

00:40:55.880 --> 00:40:55.890
most the compounds in the same order so
 

00:40:55.890 --> 00:40:57.259
most the compounds in the same order so
we want to make really everything

00:40:57.259 --> 00:40:57.269
we want to make really everything
 

00:40:57.269 --> 00:41:00.380
we want to make really everything
reproducible and so it turns out that

00:41:00.380 --> 00:41:00.390
reproducible and so it turns out that
 

00:41:00.390 --> 00:41:02.660
reproducible and so it turns out that
we've identified four compounds that are

00:41:02.660 --> 00:41:02.670
we've identified four compounds that are
 

00:41:02.670 --> 00:41:05.680
we've identified four compounds that are
reasonably active against malaria and

00:41:05.680 --> 00:41:05.690
reasonably active against malaria and
 

00:41:05.690 --> 00:41:09.279
reasonably active against malaria and
against the files being too enzyme and

00:41:09.279 --> 00:41:09.289
against the files being too enzyme and
 

00:41:09.289 --> 00:41:11.720
against the files being too enzyme and
those results can be put in another

00:41:11.720 --> 00:41:11.730
those results can be put in another
 

00:41:11.730 --> 00:41:13.819
those results can be put in another
database called collaborative drug

00:41:13.819 --> 00:41:13.829
database called collaborative drug
 

00:41:13.829 --> 00:41:16.730

haven't talked about that yet I've just
 

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:35.120
haven't talked about that yet I've just
talked about there's a notebook so

00:41:35.120 --> 00:41:35.130
talked about there's a notebook so
 

00:41:35.130 --> 00:41:37.099
talked about there's a notebook so
here's a project where we have this

00:41:37.099 --> 00:41:37.109
here's a project where we have this
 

00:41:37.109 --> 00:41:38.720

we're going to write a paper on this so

00:41:44.779 --> 00:41:44.789
we're going to write a paper on this so
 

00:41:44.789 --> 00:41:47.839
we're going to write a paper on this so
we wrote the paper on a wiki open to the

00:41:47.839 --> 00:41:47.849
we wrote the paper on a wiki open to the
 

00:41:47.849 --> 00:41:49.819
we wrote the paper on a wiki open to the
world in real time so all the drafts are

00:41:49.819 --> 00:41:49.829
world in real time so all the drafts are
 

00:41:49.829 --> 00:41:52.849
world in real time so all the drafts are
there and the really nice thing about

00:41:52.849 --> 00:41:52.859
there and the really nice thing about
 

00:41:52.859 --> 00:41:55.279
there and the really nice thing about
having a lab notebook that's open is I

00:41:55.279 --> 00:41:55.289
having a lab notebook that's open is I
 

00:41:55.289 --> 00:41:57.829
having a lab notebook that's open is I
can actually say the melting point for

00:41:57.829 --> 00:41:57.839
can actually say the melting point for
 

00:41:57.839 --> 00:41:59.660
can actually say the melting point for
this compound was obtained from

experiment 99 but it's h-nmr was
obtained from experiment 203 that's a

00:42:05.210 --> 00:42:05.220
obtained from experiment 203 that's a
 

00:42:05.220 --> 00:42:07.910
obtained from experiment 203 that's a
little simplification that gets made in

00:42:07.910 --> 00:42:07.920
little simplification that gets made in
 

00:42:07.920 --> 00:42:10.039
little simplification that gets made in
papers it says we made this compound and

00:42:10.039 --> 00:42:10.049
papers it says we made this compound and
 

00:42:10.049 --> 00:42:11.569
papers it says we made this compound and
we did these measurements that's not

00:42:11.569 --> 00:42:11.579
we did these measurements that's not
 

00:42:11.579 --> 00:42:13.339
we did these measurements that's not
really true usually they might have made

00:42:13.339 --> 00:42:13.349
really true usually they might have made
 

00:42:13.349 --> 00:42:15.650
really true usually they might have made
several batches so here you are actually

00:42:15.650 --> 00:42:15.660
several batches so here you are actually
 

00:42:15.660 --> 00:42:17.359
several batches so here you are actually
referring to the specific batch so

00:42:17.359 --> 00:42:17.369
referring to the specific batch so
 

00:42:17.369 --> 00:42:18.859
referring to the specific batch so
there's a problem down the line you can

00:42:18.859 --> 00:42:18.869
there's a problem down the line you can
 

00:42:18.869 --> 00:42:22.099
there's a problem down the line you can
you can track it back so what we also

00:42:22.099 --> 00:42:22.109
you can track it back so what we also
 

00:42:22.109 --> 00:42:23.960
you can track it back so what we also
did is we submitted that paper to a

00:42:23.960 --> 00:42:23.970
did is we submitted that paper to a
 

00:42:23.970 --> 00:42:26.390
did is we submitted that paper to a
peer-reviewed journal and borrows

00:42:26.390 --> 00:42:26.400
peer-reviewed journal and borrows
 

00:42:26.400 --> 00:42:27.499
peer-reviewed journal and borrows
mentioning journal visualized

00:42:27.499 --> 00:42:27.509
mentioning journal visualized
 

00:42:27.509 --> 00:42:29.960
mentioning journal visualized
experiments I think so this is where you

00:42:29.960 --> 00:42:29.970
experiments I think so this is where you
 

00:42:29.970 --> 00:42:31.460
experiments I think so this is where you
there's a video portion and there's also

00:42:31.460 --> 00:42:31.470
there's a video portion and there's also
 

00:42:31.470 --> 00:42:33.319
there's a video portion and there's also
a written portion so the written portion

00:42:33.319 --> 00:42:33.329
a written portion so the written portion
 

00:42:33.329 --> 00:42:36.410
a written portion so the written portion
obviously was we were on the wiki and

00:42:36.410 --> 00:42:36.420
obviously was we were on the wiki and
 

00:42:36.420 --> 00:42:39.019
obviously was we were on the wiki and
then so we got this paper accepted and

00:42:39.019 --> 00:42:39.029
then so we got this paper accepted and
 

00:42:39.029 --> 00:42:41.720
then so we got this paper accepted and
as the paper was under peer review we

00:42:41.720 --> 00:42:41.730
as the paper was under peer review we
 

00:42:41.730 --> 00:42:43.670
as the paper was under peer review we
also posted it on nature proceedings

00:42:43.670 --> 00:42:43.680
also posted it on nature proceedings
 

00:42:43.680 --> 00:42:46.640
also posted it on nature proceedings
which is a preprint site so the nice

00:42:46.640 --> 00:42:46.650
which is a preprint site so the nice
 

00:42:46.650 --> 00:42:48.890
which is a preprint site so the nice
thing about that is that you know we can

00:42:48.890 --> 00:42:48.900
thing about that is that you know we can
 

00:42:48.900 --> 00:42:50.900
thing about that is that you know we can
actually talk about this article we can

00:42:50.900 --> 00:42:50.910
actually talk about this article we can
 

00:42:50.910 --> 00:42:52.490
actually talk about this article we can
talk about everything in it I can give

00:42:52.490 --> 00:42:52.500
talk about everything in it I can give
 

00:42:52.500 --> 00:42:55.339
talk about everything in it I can give
people author lists a DOI all of it and

people author lists a DOI all of it and
 

00:42:55.349 --> 00:42:58.519
people author lists a DOI all of it and
then it gets published and Jove that's

00:42:58.519 --> 00:42:58.529
then it gets published and Jove that's
 

00:42:58.529 --> 00:43:00.710
then it gets published and Jove that's
great and at no point in time that I

00:43:00.710 --> 00:43:00.720
great and at no point in time that I
 

00:43:00.720 --> 00:43:03.289
great and at no point in time that I
have to you know that I wasn't able to

00:43:03.289 --> 00:43:03.299
have to you know that I wasn't able to
 

00:43:03.299 --> 00:43:04.550

putting everything he's doing up on
 

00:43:48.120 --> 00:43:49.850
putting everything he's doing up on
there so that that's been really nice to

00:43:49.850 --> 00:43:49.860
there so that that's been really nice to
 

00:43:49.860 --> 00:43:51.500
there so that that's been really nice to
see and obviously he's doing some

00:43:51.500 --> 00:43:51.510
see and obviously he's doing some
 

00:43:51.510 --> 00:43:55.400
see and obviously he's doing some
molecular biology here and I think I

00:43:55.400 --> 00:43:55.410
molecular biology here and I think I
 

00:43:55.410 --> 00:43:56.600
molecular biology here and I think I
mentioned most of these people might

00:43:56.600 --> 00:43:56.610
mentioned most of these people might
 

00:43:56.610 --> 00:44:03.200
mentioned most of these people might
talk and that's it I should start by

00:44:03.200 --> 00:44:03.210
talk and that's it I should start by
 

00:44:03.210 --> 00:44:04.970

everything up it's been a fun visit so
 

00:44:09.930 --> 00:44:14.300
everything up it's been a fun visit so
far and I'm going to talk about some I'm

00:44:14.300 --> 00:44:14.310
far and I'm going to talk about some I'm
 

00:44:14.310 --> 00:44:15.170
far and I'm going to talk about some I'm
going to talk about some of my own

00:44:15.170 --> 00:44:15.180
going to talk about some of my own
 

00:44:15.180 --> 00:44:17.000
going to talk about some of my own
experiences with open science during the

00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:17.010
experiences with open science during the
 

00:44:17.010 --> 00:44:19.520
experiences with open science during the
course of my PhD and some of the

00:44:19.520 --> 00:44:19.530
course of my PhD and some of the
 

00:44:19.530 --> 00:44:23.810
course of my PhD and some of the
initiatives that we started at MIT and I

00:44:23.810 --> 00:44:23.820
initiatives that we started at MIT and I
 

00:44:23.820 --> 00:44:27.080

may forget to note this explicitly on a

00:44:27.080 --> 00:44:27.090
may forget to note this explicitly on a
 

00:44:27.090 --> 00:44:28.310
may forget to note this explicitly on a
few occasions but I think you'll see

00:44:28.310 --> 00:44:28.320
few occasions but I think you'll see
 

00:44:28.320 --> 00:44:30.230
few occasions but I think you'll see
there's a lot of common themes between

00:44:30.230 --> 00:44:30.240
there's a lot of common themes between
 

00:44:30.240 --> 00:44:32.270
there's a lot of common themes between
what both Bora and jean-claude have

00:44:32.270 --> 00:44:32.280
what both Bora and jean-claude have
 

00:44:32.280 --> 00:44:38.930
what both Bora and jean-claude have
previously talked about so

00:44:38.930 --> 00:44:38.940
 

00:44:38.940 --> 00:44:40.770
so I'm going to talk about my own

00:44:40.770 --> 00:44:40.780
so I'm going to talk about my own
 

00:44:40.780 --> 00:44:42.630
so I'm going to talk about my own
specific experiences so it makes sense

00:44:42.630 --> 00:44:42.640
specific experiences so it makes sense
 

00:44:42.640 --> 00:44:45.180
specific experiences so it makes sense
to talk a little bit about about what I

00:44:45.180 --> 00:44:45.190
to talk a little bit about about what I
 

00:44:45.190 --> 00:44:46.440
to talk a little bit about about what I
did so I'm going to give some

00:44:46.440 --> 00:44:46.450
did so I'm going to give some
 

00:44:46.450 --> 00:44:48.390
did so I'm going to give some
definitions and this is a sort of a

00:44:48.390 --> 00:44:48.400
definitions and this is a sort of a
 

00:44:48.400 --> 00:44:50.040
definitions and this is a sort of a
limited definition of myself I'm a

00:44:50.040 --> 00:44:50.050
limited definition of myself I'm a
 

00:44:50.050 --> 00:44:52.740
limited definition of myself I'm a
synthetic biologist is the sort of work

00:44:52.740 --> 00:44:52.750
synthetic biologist is the sort of work
 

00:44:52.750 --> 00:44:54.900
synthetic biologist is the sort of work
I do I'm now with the startup King

00:44:54.900 --> 00:44:54.910
I do I'm now with the startup King
 

00:44:54.910 --> 00:44:57.360
I do I'm now with the startup King
caballo works and I've also been

00:44:57.360 --> 00:44:57.370
caballo works and I've also been
 

00:44:57.370 --> 00:44:59.100
caballo works and I've also been
involved a lot with open wetware org

00:44:59.100 --> 00:44:59.110
involved a lot with open wetware org
 

00:44:59.110 --> 00:45:00.840
involved a lot with open wetware org
which I'll talk about a little bit later

00:45:00.840 --> 00:45:00.850
which I'll talk about a little bit later
 

00:45:00.850 --> 00:45:04.920
which I'll talk about a little bit later
and so I want to explain just very

00:45:04.920 --> 00:45:04.930
and so I want to explain just very
 

00:45:04.930 --> 00:45:07.130
and so I want to explain just very
briefly what synthetic biology is and

00:45:07.130 --> 00:45:07.140
briefly what synthetic biology is and
 

00:45:07.140 --> 00:45:11.130
briefly what synthetic biology is and
synthetic biology is a new discipline we

00:45:11.130 --> 00:45:11.140
synthetic biology is a new discipline we
 

00:45:11.140 --> 00:45:12.720
synthetic biology is a new discipline we
and its goal is to design and build

00:45:12.720 --> 00:45:12.730
and its goal is to design and build
 

00:45:12.730 --> 00:45:15.330
and its goal is to design and build
novel biological systems aided by an

00:45:15.330 --> 00:45:15.340
novel biological systems aided by an
 

00:45:15.340 --> 00:45:18.270
novel biological systems aided by an
engineering infrastructure so to split

00:45:18.270 --> 00:45:18.280
engineering infrastructure so to split
 

00:45:18.280 --> 00:45:20.910
engineering infrastructure so to split
that sentence up into two parts we're

00:45:20.910 --> 00:45:20.920
that sentence up into two parts we're
 

00:45:20.920 --> 00:45:22.530
that sentence up into two parts we're
designing and building novel biological

00:45:22.530 --> 00:45:22.540
designing and building novel biological
 

00:45:22.540 --> 00:45:24.030
designing and building novel biological
systems for example we'd like to

00:45:24.030 --> 00:45:24.040
systems for example we'd like to
 

00:45:24.040 --> 00:45:26.780
systems for example we'd like to
reprogram bacteria to produce biofuels

00:45:26.780 --> 00:45:26.790
reprogram bacteria to produce biofuels
 

00:45:26.790 --> 00:45:30.810
reprogram bacteria to produce biofuels
drugs or other valuable chemicals and

00:45:30.810 --> 00:45:30.820
drugs or other valuable chemicals and
 

00:45:30.820 --> 00:45:32.880
drugs or other valuable chemicals and
we'd like to do it through the use of an

00:45:32.880 --> 00:45:32.890
we'd like to do it through the use of an
 

00:45:32.890 --> 00:45:34.410
we'd like to do it through the use of an
engineering infrastructure and what that

00:45:34.410 --> 00:45:34.420
engineering infrastructure and what that
 

00:45:34.420 --> 00:45:36.150
engineering infrastructure and what that
means is that rather than trying to

00:45:36.150 --> 00:45:36.160
means is that rather than trying to
 

00:45:36.160 --> 00:45:38.100
means is that rather than trying to
engineer bacteria in a sort of an ad hoc

00:45:38.100 --> 00:45:38.110
engineer bacteria in a sort of an ad hoc
 

00:45:38.110 --> 00:45:40.710
engineer bacteria in a sort of an ad hoc
fashion as it has been the the standard

00:45:40.710 --> 00:45:40.720
fashion as it has been the the standard
 

00:45:40.720 --> 00:45:43.410
fashion as it has been the the standard
in genetic engineering and metabolic

00:45:43.410 --> 00:45:43.420
in genetic engineering and metabolic
 

00:45:43.420 --> 00:45:45.990
in genetic engineering and metabolic
engineering and disciplines we'd like to

00:45:45.990 --> 00:45:46.000
engineering and disciplines we'd like to
 

00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:48.150
engineering and disciplines we'd like to
use something more similar to the way

00:45:48.150 --> 00:45:48.160
use something more similar to the way
 

00:45:48.160 --> 00:45:49.920
use something more similar to the way
electrical engineering works where

00:45:49.920 --> 00:45:49.930
electrical engineering works where
 

00:45:49.930 --> 00:45:52.070
electrical engineering works where
there's a lot of use of standardization

00:45:52.070 --> 00:45:52.080
there's a lot of use of standardization
 

00:45:52.080 --> 00:45:55.350
there's a lot of use of standardization
parts and computer-aided design tools

00:45:55.350 --> 00:45:55.360
parts and computer-aided design tools
 

00:45:55.360 --> 00:45:56.940
parts and computer-aided design tools
and we'd like to try and introduce some

00:45:56.940 --> 00:45:56.950
and we'd like to try and introduce some
 

00:45:56.950 --> 00:45:58.980
and we'd like to try and introduce some
of those kind of tools into the

00:45:58.980 --> 00:45:58.990
of those kind of tools into the
 

00:45:58.990 --> 00:46:02.010
of those kind of tools into the
discipline of engineering biology so

00:46:02.010 --> 00:46:02.020
discipline of engineering biology so
 

00:46:02.020 --> 00:46:03.780
discipline of engineering biology so
that's the kind of stuff that we've been

00:46:03.780 --> 00:46:03.790
that's the kind of stuff that we've been
 

00:46:03.790 --> 00:46:05.970
that's the kind of stuff that we've been
trying to do and the last concept I want

00:46:05.970 --> 00:46:05.980
trying to do and the last concept I want
 

00:46:05.980 --> 00:46:07.800
trying to do and the last concept I want
to introduce is this concept of parts

00:46:07.800 --> 00:46:07.810
to introduce is this concept of parts
 

00:46:07.810 --> 00:46:10.560
to introduce is this concept of parts
and parts are essentially pieces of DNA

00:46:10.560 --> 00:46:10.570
and parts are essentially pieces of DNA
 

00:46:10.570 --> 00:46:12.660
and parts are essentially pieces of DNA
that encodes some sort of basic

00:46:12.660 --> 00:46:12.670
that encodes some sort of basic
 

00:46:12.670 --> 00:46:14.430
that encodes some sort of basic
biological function and if you take a

00:46:14.430 --> 00:46:14.440
biological function and if you take a
 

00:46:14.440 --> 00:46:16.080
biological function and if you take a
bunch of parts and you put them together

00:46:16.080 --> 00:46:16.090
bunch of parts and you put them together
 

00:46:16.090 --> 00:46:17.460
bunch of parts and you put them together
and you put them together in the right

00:46:17.460 --> 00:46:17.470
and you put them together in the right
 

00:46:17.470 --> 00:46:21.060
and you put them together in the right
order and you can use at that set of

00:46:21.060 --> 00:46:21.070
order and you can use at that set of
 

00:46:21.070 --> 00:46:22.950
order and you can use at that set of
parts to reprogram a bacteria to do

00:46:22.950 --> 00:46:22.960
parts to reprogram a bacteria to do
 

00:46:22.960 --> 00:46:24.720
parts to reprogram a bacteria to do
something interesting so that's sort of

00:46:24.720 --> 00:46:24.730
something interesting so that's sort of
 

00:46:24.730 --> 00:46:27.510
something interesting so that's sort of
that the means that we that we follow to

00:46:27.510 --> 00:46:27.520
that the means that we that we follow to
 

00:46:27.520 --> 00:46:30.450
that the means that we that we follow to
try and make a cells do new and

00:46:30.450 --> 00:46:30.460
try and make a cells do new and
 

00:46:30.460 --> 00:46:33.210
try and make a cells do new and
interesting things but we have some

00:46:33.210 --> 00:46:33.220
interesting things but we have some
 

00:46:33.220 --> 00:46:35.160
interesting things but we have some
problems in this new discipline the

00:46:35.160 --> 00:46:35.170
problems in this new discipline the
 

00:46:35.170 --> 00:46:37.050
problems in this new discipline the
first problem is that this idea of

00:46:37.050 --> 00:46:37.060
first problem is that this idea of
 

00:46:37.060 --> 00:46:39.120
first problem is that this idea of
biological parts which we call BioBricks

00:46:39.120 --> 00:46:39.130
biological parts which we call BioBricks
 

00:46:39.130 --> 00:46:42.570
biological parts which we call BioBricks
they don't currently exist so we have to

00:46:42.570 --> 00:46:42.580
they don't currently exist so we have to
 

00:46:42.580 --> 00:46:44.370
they don't currently exist so we have to
invent them and we have to invent a

00:46:44.370 --> 00:46:44.380
invent them and we have to invent a
 

00:46:44.380 --> 00:46:46.050
invent them and we have to invent a
means to describe them and it means to

00:46:46.050 --> 00:46:46.060
means to describe them and it means to
 

00:46:46.060 --> 00:46:47.400
means to describe them and it means to
share them so they

00:46:47.400 --> 00:46:47.410
share them so they
 

00:46:47.410 --> 00:46:49.760
share them so they
can be easily reused by by other people

00:46:49.760 --> 00:46:49.770
can be easily reused by by other people
 

00:46:49.770 --> 00:46:52.650
can be easily reused by by other people
the second problem we have is that a lot

00:46:52.650 --> 00:46:52.660
the second problem we have is that a lot
 

00:46:52.660 --> 00:46:54.029
the second problem we have is that a lot
of people who are attracted to synthetic

00:46:54.029 --> 00:46:54.039
of people who are attracted to synthetic
 

00:46:54.039 --> 00:46:56.520
of people who are attracted to synthetic
biology our engineers computer

00:46:56.520 --> 00:46:56.530
biology our engineers computer
 

00:46:56.530 --> 00:46:57.930
biology our engineers computer
scientists and people from backgrounds

00:46:57.930 --> 00:46:57.940
scientists and people from backgrounds
 

00:46:57.940 --> 00:47:00.390
scientists and people from backgrounds
other than biology and I was a

00:47:00.390 --> 00:47:00.400
other than biology and I was a
 

00:47:00.400 --> 00:47:02.460
other than biology and I was a
mechanical engineer originally and that

00:47:02.460 --> 00:47:02.470
mechanical engineer originally and that
 

00:47:02.470 --> 00:47:03.900
mechanical engineer originally and that
means that we don't we typically don't

00:47:03.900 --> 00:47:03.910
means that we don't we typically don't
 

00:47:03.910 --> 00:47:05.490
means that we don't we typically don't
have the sort of the training both

00:47:05.490 --> 00:47:05.500
have the sort of the training both
 

00:47:05.500 --> 00:47:08.700
have the sort of the training both
practical and in the classroom about a

00:47:08.700 --> 00:47:08.710
practical and in the classroom about a
 

00:47:08.710 --> 00:47:11.010
practical and in the classroom about a
lot of that sort of standard molecular

00:47:11.010 --> 00:47:11.020
lot of that sort of standard molecular
 

00:47:11.020 --> 00:47:13.770
lot of that sort of standard molecular
biology techniques so we have these we

00:47:13.770 --> 00:47:13.780
biology techniques so we have these we
 

00:47:13.780 --> 00:47:15.480
biology techniques so we have these we
have these two problems I think the

00:47:15.480 --> 00:47:15.490
have these two problems I think the
 

00:47:15.490 --> 00:47:16.710
have these two problems I think the
second problem is sort of an interesting

00:47:16.710 --> 00:47:16.720
second problem is sort of an interesting
 

00:47:16.720 --> 00:47:18.510
second problem is sort of an interesting
extension of what boero was talking

00:47:18.510 --> 00:47:18.520
extension of what boero was talking
 

00:47:18.520 --> 00:47:21.059
extension of what boero was talking
about earlier where you have you have

00:47:21.059 --> 00:47:21.069
about earlier where you have you have
 

00:47:21.069 --> 00:47:23.250
about earlier where you have you have
the problem where because information

00:47:23.250 --> 00:47:23.260
the problem where because information
 

00:47:23.260 --> 00:47:25.650
the problem where because information
has been sort of localized and hard to

00:47:25.650 --> 00:47:25.660
has been sort of localized and hard to
 

00:47:25.660 --> 00:47:27.839
has been sort of localized and hard to
get access to if you're if you are at a

00:47:27.839 --> 00:47:27.849
get access to if you're if you are at a
 

00:47:27.849 --> 00:47:30.029
get access to if you're if you are at a
non-major resourcing institution it's

00:47:30.029 --> 00:47:30.039
non-major resourcing institution it's
 

00:47:30.039 --> 00:47:31.349
non-major resourcing institution it's
it's hard to get access to that

00:47:31.349 --> 00:47:31.359
it's hard to get access to that
 

00:47:31.359 --> 00:47:32.910
it's hard to get access to that
information there's another problem

00:47:32.910 --> 00:47:32.920
information there's another problem
 

00:47:32.920 --> 00:47:35.339
information there's another problem
where even people who are at major

00:47:35.339 --> 00:47:35.349
where even people who are at major
 

00:47:35.349 --> 00:47:36.930
where even people who are at major
research institutions if they're trying

00:47:36.930 --> 00:47:36.940
research institutions if they're trying
 

00:47:36.940 --> 00:47:39.150
research institutions if they're trying
to change the sort of the discipline

00:47:39.150 --> 00:47:39.160
to change the sort of the discipline
 

00:47:39.160 --> 00:47:40.650
to change the sort of the discipline
that they're they're working on or

00:47:40.650 --> 00:47:40.660
that they're they're working on or
 

00:47:40.660 --> 00:47:42.329
that they're they're working on or
they're trying to apply their technology

00:47:42.329 --> 00:47:42.339
they're trying to apply their technology
 

00:47:42.339 --> 00:47:44.700
they're trying to apply their technology
to some new field it's hard to learn

00:47:44.700 --> 00:47:44.710
to some new field it's hard to learn
 

00:47:44.710 --> 00:47:47.789
to some new field it's hard to learn
about that new field so it's sort of

00:47:47.789 --> 00:47:47.799
about that new field so it's sort of
 

00:47:47.799 --> 00:47:49.410
about that new field so it's sort of
this general problem of information

00:47:49.410 --> 00:47:49.420
this general problem of information
 

00:47:49.420 --> 00:47:51.420
this general problem of information
being constrained and forward a nice job

00:47:51.420 --> 00:47:51.430
being constrained and forward a nice job
 

00:47:51.430 --> 00:47:53.339
being constrained and forward a nice job
of explaining how we're moving away from

00:47:53.339 --> 00:47:53.349
of explaining how we're moving away from
 

00:47:53.349 --> 00:47:55.920
of explaining how we're moving away from
from that so I'm going to talk about

00:47:55.920 --> 00:47:55.930
from that so I'm going to talk about
 

00:47:55.930 --> 00:47:58.500
from that so I'm going to talk about
solutions to these two problems the

00:47:58.500 --> 00:47:58.510
solutions to these two problems the
 

00:47:58.510 --> 00:48:01.230
solutions to these two problems the
first solution that it came out of MIT a

00:48:01.230 --> 00:48:01.240
first solution that it came out of MIT a
 

00:48:01.240 --> 00:48:03.599
first solution that it came out of MIT a
little bit before i got there was at the

00:48:03.599 --> 00:48:03.609
little bit before i got there was at the
 

00:48:03.609 --> 00:48:05.940
little bit before i got there was at the
registry of standard biological parts so

00:48:05.940 --> 00:48:05.950
registry of standard biological parts so
 

00:48:05.950 --> 00:48:08.400
registry of standard biological parts so
this is a website which is essentially a

00:48:08.400 --> 00:48:08.410
this is a website which is essentially a
 

00:48:08.410 --> 00:48:11.010
this is a website which is essentially a
catalog of his early collections of

00:48:11.010 --> 00:48:11.020
catalog of his early collections of
 

00:48:11.020 --> 00:48:12.839
catalog of his early collections of
these biobrick parts that we've been

00:48:12.839 --> 00:48:12.849
these biobrick parts that we've been
 

00:48:12.849 --> 00:48:15.120
these biobrick parts that we've been
making people at MIT and people at other

00:48:15.120 --> 00:48:15.130
making people at MIT and people at other
 

00:48:15.130 --> 00:48:17.190
making people at MIT and people at other
institutions and it's sort of modeled on

00:48:17.190 --> 00:48:17.200
institutions and it's sort of modeled on
 

00:48:17.200 --> 00:48:22.140
institutions and it's sort of modeled on
the Texas Instruments electronic device

00:48:22.140 --> 00:48:22.150
the Texas Instruments electronic device
 

00:48:22.150 --> 00:48:24.000
the Texas Instruments electronic device
catalogs and kind of the 70s and 80s

00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:24.010
catalogs and kind of the 70s and 80s
 

00:48:24.010 --> 00:48:25.529
catalogs and kind of the 70s and 80s
where you could go and look up a

00:48:25.529 --> 00:48:25.539
where you could go and look up a
 

00:48:25.539 --> 00:48:28.380
where you could go and look up a
particular transistor or a capacitor or

00:48:28.380 --> 00:48:28.390
particular transistor or a capacitor or
 

00:48:28.390 --> 00:48:31.799
particular transistor or a capacitor or
an inverter circuit and so this is a

00:48:31.799 --> 00:48:31.809
an inverter circuit and so this is a
 

00:48:31.809 --> 00:48:33.930
an inverter circuit and so this is a
website that's your free and open and

00:48:33.930 --> 00:48:33.940
website that's your free and open and
 

00:48:33.940 --> 00:48:36.299
website that's your free and open and
editable and it's it's a sort of a

00:48:36.299 --> 00:48:36.309
editable and it's it's a sort of a
 

00:48:36.309 --> 00:48:37.910
editable and it's it's a sort of a
combination of a database in a wiki

00:48:37.910 --> 00:48:37.920
combination of a database in a wiki
 

00:48:37.920 --> 00:48:41.130
combination of a database in a wiki
where you can add parts you can describe

00:48:41.130 --> 00:48:41.140
where you can add parts you can describe
 

00:48:41.140 --> 00:48:43.170
where you can add parts you can describe
the parts that you've made you can

00:48:43.170 --> 00:48:43.180
the parts that you've made you can
 

00:48:43.180 --> 00:48:45.450
the parts that you've made you can
comment on other people's parts all that

00:48:45.450 --> 00:48:45.460
comment on other people's parts all that
 

00:48:45.460 --> 00:48:48.120
comment on other people's parts all that
sort of wiki functionality under the

00:48:48.120 --> 00:48:48.130
sort of wiki functionality under the

00:52:37.870 --> 00:52:39.660
total of seventy teams of undergraduates
around the world who worked on this

00:52:39.660 --> 00:52:39.670
around the world who worked on this
 

00:52:39.670 --> 00:52:42.360
around the world who worked on this
during the summer and and everything

00:52:42.360 --> 00:52:42.370
during the summer and and everything
 

00:52:42.370 --> 00:52:44.520
during the summer and and everything
they do they do in the open all the

00:52:44.520 --> 00:52:44.530
they do they do in the open all the
 

00:52:44.530 --> 00:52:45.750
they do they do in the open all the
parts that they make they have to

00:52:45.750 --> 00:52:45.760
parts that they make they have to
 

00:52:45.760 --> 00:52:48.120
parts that they make they have to
contribute back to the registry all

00:52:48.120 --> 00:52:48.130
contribute back to the registry all
 

00:52:48.130 --> 00:52:51.540
contribute back to the registry all
their their lab notebooks are stored on

00:52:51.540 --> 00:52:51.550
their their lab notebooks are stored on
 

00:52:51.550 --> 00:52:54.450
their their lab notebooks are stored on
on a wiki that's run by the the I gem

00:52:54.450 --> 00:52:54.460
on a wiki that's run by the the I gem
 

00:52:54.460 --> 00:52:56.850
on a wiki that's run by the the I gem
organization and they do everything

00:52:56.850 --> 00:52:56.860
organization and they do everything
 

00:52:56.860 --> 00:53:00.150
organization and they do everything
basically in the open and and this might

00:53:00.150 --> 00:53:00.160
basically in the open and and this might
 

00:53:00.160 --> 00:53:04.099
basically in the open and and this might
be a good time to

00:53:04.099 --> 00:53:04.109
 

00:53:04.109 --> 00:53:08.460
show you one of those and I think this

00:53:08.460 --> 00:53:08.470
show you one of those and I think this
 

00:53:08.470 --> 00:53:10.230
show you one of those and I think this
is interesting because this is us this

00:53:10.230 --> 00:53:10.240
is interesting because this is us this
 

00:53:10.240 --> 00:53:12.120
is interesting because this is us this
is an undergraduate comp it's a

00:53:12.120 --> 00:53:12.130
is an undergraduate comp it's a
 

00:53:12.130 --> 00:53:14.220
is an undergraduate comp it's a
competition and it's it's research

00:53:14.220 --> 00:53:14.230
competition and it's it's research
 

00:53:14.230 --> 00:53:16.559
competition and it's it's research
they're doing they're doing new work but

00:53:16.559 --> 00:53:16.569
they're doing they're doing new work but
 

00:53:16.569 --> 00:53:21.809
they're doing they're doing new work but
engineered into the competition is is a

00:53:21.809 --> 00:53:21.819
engineered into the competition is is a
 

00:53:21.819 --> 00:53:23.970
engineered into the competition is is a
sort of a pressure to be open so for

00:53:23.970 --> 00:53:23.980
sort of a pressure to be open so for
 

00:53:23.980 --> 00:53:26.210
sort of a pressure to be open so for
example there's there's prizes for who

00:53:26.210 --> 00:53:26.220
example there's there's prizes for who
 

00:53:26.220 --> 00:53:29.640
example there's there's prizes for who
who has the best lab notebook and wiki

00:53:29.640 --> 00:53:29.650
who has the best lab notebook and wiki
 

00:53:29.650 --> 00:53:31.549
who has the best lab notebook and wiki
at the at the end of the competition and

00:53:31.549 --> 00:53:31.559
at the at the end of the competition and
 

00:53:31.559 --> 00:53:33.960
at the at the end of the competition and
so it's a it's a it's a it's a

00:53:33.960 --> 00:53:33.970
so it's a it's a it's a it's a
 

00:53:33.970 --> 00:53:35.039
so it's a it's a it's a it's a
competition that has been sort of

00:53:35.039 --> 00:53:35.049
competition that has been sort of
 

00:53:35.049 --> 00:53:37.589
competition that has been sort of
engineered to to provide incentives to

00:53:37.589 --> 00:53:37.599
engineered to to provide incentives to
 

00:53:37.599 --> 00:53:39.029
engineered to to provide incentives to
people who want to share information

00:53:39.029 --> 00:53:39.039
people who want to share information
 

00:53:39.039 --> 00:53:41.130
people who want to share information
earlier and so that's sort of an

00:53:41.130 --> 00:53:41.140
earlier and so that's sort of an
 

00:53:41.140 --> 00:53:42.990
earlier and so that's sort of an
interesting that's interesting because

00:53:42.990 --> 00:53:43.000
interesting that's interesting because
 

00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:44.759
interesting that's interesting because
the sort of the current reward structure

00:53:44.759 --> 00:53:44.769
the sort of the current reward structure
 

00:53:44.769 --> 00:53:47.400
the sort of the current reward structure
in science does not reward yeah are

00:53:47.400 --> 00:53:47.410
in science does not reward yeah are
 

00:53:47.410 --> 00:53:49.499
in science does not reward yeah are
often does not reward people being open

00:53:49.499 --> 00:53:49.509
often does not reward people being open
 

00:53:49.509 --> 00:53:51.509
often does not reward people being open
or they at least they think it doesn't

00:53:51.509 --> 00:53:51.519
or they at least they think it doesn't
 

00:53:51.519 --> 00:53:55.410
or they at least they think it doesn't
and so here's a here's an example this

00:53:55.410 --> 00:53:55.420
and so here's a here's an example this
 

00:53:55.420 --> 00:53:58.140
and so here's a here's an example this
is the this is the winning wiki from

00:53:58.140 --> 00:53:58.150
is the this is the winning wiki from
 

00:53:58.150 --> 00:53:59.700
is the this is the winning wiki from
from last year you can see there's

00:53:59.700 --> 00:53:59.710
from last year you can see there's
 

00:53:59.710 --> 00:54:01.499
from last year you can see there's
information about the team there's the

00:54:01.499 --> 00:54:01.509
information about the team there's the
 

00:54:01.509 --> 00:54:03.779
information about the team there's the
calendar of what they did when the parts

00:54:03.779 --> 00:54:03.789
calendar of what they did when the parts
 

00:54:03.789 --> 00:54:05.749
calendar of what they did when the parts
they made and contributed back pictures

00:54:05.749 --> 00:54:05.759
they made and contributed back pictures
 

00:54:05.759 --> 00:54:08.279
they made and contributed back pictures
you can they have a lab notebook where

00:54:08.279 --> 00:54:08.289
you can they have a lab notebook where
 

00:54:08.289 --> 00:54:10.079
you can they have a lab notebook where
you can click on particular dates and

00:54:10.079 --> 00:54:10.089
you can click on particular dates and
 

00:54:10.089 --> 00:54:12.960
you can click on particular dates and
I'm sort of picking this at random looks

00:54:12.960 --> 00:54:12.970
I'm sort of picking this at random looks
 

00:54:12.970 --> 00:54:16.289
I'm sort of picking this at random looks
like that was a bad day in the lab see

00:54:16.289 --> 00:54:16.299
like that was a bad day in the lab see
 

00:54:16.299 --> 00:54:19.559
like that was a bad day in the lab see
that's right here and yeah so they've

00:54:19.559 --> 00:54:19.569
that's right here and yeah so they've
 

00:54:19.569 --> 00:54:22.769
that's right here and yeah so they've
kept a lot of their data online I didn't

00:54:22.769 --> 00:54:22.779
kept a lot of their data online I didn't
 

00:54:22.779 --> 00:54:24.359
kept a lot of their data online I didn't
pick a particular page to show but on

00:54:24.359 --> 00:54:24.369
pick a particular page to show but on
 

00:54:24.369 --> 00:54:25.859
pick a particular page to show but on
some pages you'll see they have sort of

00:54:25.859 --> 00:54:25.869
some pages you'll see they have sort of
 

00:54:25.869 --> 00:54:27.749
some pages you'll see they have sort of
like gel images and all their data

00:54:27.749 --> 00:54:27.759
like gel images and all their data
 

00:54:27.759 --> 00:54:29.640
like gel images and all their data
available so anyway this is it this is a

00:54:29.640 --> 00:54:29.650
available so anyway this is it this is a
 

00:54:29.650 --> 00:54:31.710
available so anyway this is it this is a
group of about a thousand undergraduates

00:54:31.710 --> 00:54:31.720
group of about a thousand undergraduates
 

00:54:31.720 --> 00:54:34.740
group of about a thousand undergraduates
every summer who are being trained to do

00:54:34.740 --> 00:54:34.750
every summer who are being trained to do
 

00:54:34.750 --> 00:54:37.170
every summer who are being trained to do
open science and to be celebrated for

00:54:37.170 --> 00:54:37.180
open science and to be celebrated for
 

00:54:37.180 --> 00:54:39.089
open science and to be celebrated for
doing that so I think that's a pretty

00:54:39.089 --> 00:54:39.099
doing that so I think that's a pretty
 

00:54:39.099 --> 00:54:42.499
doing that so I think that's a pretty
pretty powerful story some of them there

00:54:42.499 --> 00:54:42.509
pretty powerful story some of them there
 

00:54:42.509 --> 00:54:45.359
pretty powerful story some of them there
so that kind of gets us onto onto wiki's

00:54:45.359 --> 00:54:45.369
so that kind of gets us onto onto wiki's
 

00:54:45.369 --> 00:54:47.640
so that kind of gets us onto onto wiki's
and and that was the next thing I wanted

00:54:47.640 --> 00:54:47.650
and and that was the next thing I wanted
 

00:54:47.650 --> 00:54:50.700
and and that was the next thing I wanted
to talk about so open wetware is a wiki

00:54:50.700 --> 00:54:50.710
to talk about so open wetware is a wiki
 

00:54:50.710 --> 00:54:52.650
to talk about so open wetware is a wiki
you heard it introduced to the start

00:54:52.650 --> 00:54:52.660
you heard it introduced to the start
 

00:54:52.660 --> 00:54:54.240
you heard it introduced to the start
it's to promote sharing information

00:54:54.240 --> 00:54:54.250
it's to promote sharing information
 

00:54:54.250 --> 00:54:56.730
it's to promote sharing information
among biological and biological

00:54:56.730 --> 00:54:56.740
among biological and biological
 

00:54:56.740 --> 00:54:58.980
among biological and biological
engineers and we started this at MIT

00:54:58.980 --> 00:54:58.990
engineers and we started this at MIT
 

00:54:58.990 --> 00:55:01.259
engineers and we started this at MIT
because even within our lab we had

00:55:01.259 --> 00:55:01.269
because even within our lab we had
 

00:55:01.269 --> 00:55:04.230
because even within our lab we had
problems sharing as much information as

00:55:04.230 --> 00:55:04.240
problems sharing as much information as
 

00:55:04.240 --> 00:55:06.450
problems sharing as much information as
we wanted between each other so we said

00:55:06.450 --> 00:55:06.460
we wanted between each other so we said
 

00:55:06.460 --> 00:55:08.700
we wanted between each other so we said
okay we'll have a lab wiki and we'll

00:55:08.700 --> 00:55:08.710
okay we'll have a lab wiki and we'll
 

00:55:08.710 --> 00:55:10.440
okay we'll have a lab wiki and we'll
we'll share information this was back in

00:55:10.440 --> 00:55:10.450
we'll share information this was back in
 

00:55:10.450 --> 00:55:13.589
we'll share information this was back in
in early 2005 and then we decided well

00:55:13.589 --> 00:55:13.599
in early 2005 and then we decided well
 

00:55:13.599 --> 00:55:14.999
in early 2005 and then we decided well
there's a there's a lot we collaborate

00:55:14.999 --> 00:55:15.009
there's a there's a lot we collaborate
 

00:55:15.009 --> 00:55:17.300
there's a there's a lot we collaborate
with across the at the other end of MI

00:55:17.300 --> 00:55:17.310
with across the at the other end of MI
 

00:55:17.310 --> 00:55:18.620
with across the at the other end of MI
to campus and we'd like to share

00:55:18.620 --> 00:55:18.630
to campus and we'd like to share
 

00:55:18.630 --> 00:55:19.790
to campus and we'd like to share
information with them because they do

00:55:19.790 --> 00:55:19.800
information with them because they do
 

00:55:19.800 --> 00:55:22.670
information with them because they do
the same stuff as us so they came on and

00:55:22.670 --> 00:55:22.680
the same stuff as us so they came on and
 

00:55:22.680 --> 00:55:25.100
the same stuff as us so they came on and
then you know a couple of the labs jet

00:55:25.100 --> 00:55:25.110
then you know a couple of the labs jet
 

00:55:25.110 --> 00:55:27.230
then you know a couple of the labs jet
down the hall also found it would be

00:55:27.230 --> 00:55:27.240
down the hall also found it would be
 

00:55:27.240 --> 00:55:29.270
down the hall also found it would be
useful and they joined as well and sort

00:55:29.270 --> 00:55:29.280
useful and they joined as well and sort
 

00:55:29.280 --> 00:55:31.280
useful and they joined as well and sort
of spread organically like that and

00:55:31.280 --> 00:55:31.290
of spread organically like that and
 

00:55:31.290 --> 00:55:34.100
of spread organically like that and
quickly spread outside of MIT and at

00:55:34.100 --> 00:55:34.110
quickly spread outside of MIT and at
 

00:55:34.110 --> 00:55:36.800
quickly spread outside of MIT and at
this point there's about 150 labs on

00:55:36.800 --> 00:55:36.810
this point there's about 150 labs on
 

00:55:36.810 --> 00:55:38.990
this point there's about 150 labs on
open wet where there is over five

00:55:38.990 --> 00:55:39.000
open wet where there is over five
 

00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:42.440
open wet where there is over five
thousand registered users and so let me

00:55:42.440 --> 00:55:42.450
thousand registered users and so let me
 

00:55:42.450 --> 00:55:45.380
thousand registered users and so let me
just give you an idea of what what what

00:55:45.380 --> 00:55:45.390
just give you an idea of what what what
 

00:55:45.390 --> 00:55:47.690
just give you an idea of what what what
open wetware is there's a lot of

00:55:47.690 --> 00:55:47.700
open wetware is there's a lot of
 

00:55:47.700 --> 00:55:55.130
open wetware is there's a lot of
different things on it so open where has

00:55:55.130 --> 00:55:55.140
different things on it so open where has
 

00:55:55.140 --> 00:55:56.420
different things on it so open where has
a lot of different content one of the

00:55:56.420 --> 00:55:56.430
a lot of different content one of the
 

00:55:56.430 --> 00:55:58.070
a lot of different content one of the
things that has is a lot of people keep

00:55:58.070 --> 00:55:58.080
things that has is a lot of people keep
 

00:55:58.080 --> 00:55:59.960
things that has is a lot of people keep
their their lab websites on there so

00:55:59.960 --> 00:55:59.970
their their lab websites on there so
 

00:55:59.970 --> 00:56:01.910
their their lab websites on there so
this is the croissant ylab from the from

00:56:01.910 --> 00:56:01.920
this is the croissant ylab from the from
 

00:56:01.920 --> 00:56:03.680
this is the croissant ylab from the from
Imperial you can see there's information

00:56:03.680 --> 00:56:03.690
Imperial you can see there's information
 

00:56:03.690 --> 00:56:06.200
Imperial you can see there's information
about who's in the lab their

00:56:06.200 --> 00:56:06.210
about who's in the lab their
 

00:56:06.210 --> 00:56:09.470
about who's in the lab their
publications have pictures they keep a

00:56:09.470 --> 00:56:09.480
publications have pictures they keep a
 

00:56:09.480 --> 00:56:11.060
publications have pictures they keep a
lot of technical information on here

00:56:11.060 --> 00:56:11.070
lot of technical information on here
 

00:56:11.070 --> 00:56:12.830
lot of technical information on here
what restriction enzymes they use their

00:56:12.830 --> 00:56:12.840
what restriction enzymes they use their
 

00:56:12.840 --> 00:56:15.320
what restriction enzymes they use their
their chemicals how to do ordering all

wetware provides it easy for people to

00:56:22.430 --> 00:56:22.440
wetware provides it easy for people to
 

00:56:22.440 --> 00:56:24.080
wetware provides it easy for people to
share that sort of information within

00:56:24.080 --> 00:56:24.090
share that sort of information within
 

00:56:24.090 --> 00:56:26.870
share that sort of information within
their groups and they also keep

00:56:26.870 --> 00:56:26.880
their groups and they also keep
 

00:56:26.880 --> 00:56:28.760
their groups and they also keep
descriptions of their of their research

00:56:28.760 --> 00:56:28.770
descriptions of their of their research
 

00:56:28.770 --> 00:56:31.460
descriptions of their of their research
online so you see a lot of things like

00:56:31.460 --> 00:56:31.470
online so you see a lot of things like
 

00:56:31.470 --> 00:56:33.830
online so you see a lot of things like
that there's also a collection of

00:56:33.830 --> 00:56:33.840
that there's also a collection of
 

00:56:33.840 --> 00:56:36.500
that there's also a collection of
protocols and that are edited by the

00:56:36.500 --> 00:56:36.510
protocols and that are edited by the
 

00:56:36.510 --> 00:56:39.470
protocols and that are edited by the
community people contribute them and so

00:56:39.470 --> 00:56:39.480
community people contribute them and so
 

00:56:39.480 --> 00:56:41.450
community people contribute them and so
for example escherichia coli there's a

that everybody can use and and this was

00:56:56.060 --> 00:56:56.070
that everybody can use and and this was
 

00:56:56.070 --> 00:56:57.950
that everybody can use and and this was
really helpful to us when we got started

00:56:57.950 --> 00:56:57.960
really helpful to us when we got started
 

00:56:57.960 --> 00:57:02.420
really helpful to us when we got started
because we we were a group of people

00:57:02.420 --> 00:57:02.430
because we we were a group of people
 

00:57:02.430 --> 00:57:04.070
because we we were a group of people
doing research that we hadn't been

00:57:04.070 --> 00:57:04.080
doing research that we hadn't been
 

00:57:04.080 --> 00:57:05.930
doing research that we hadn't been
trained to do in some sense because we

00:57:05.930 --> 00:57:05.940
trained to do in some sense because we
 

00:57:05.940 --> 00:57:06.830
trained to do in some sense because we
were spending a lot of time doing

00:57:06.830 --> 00:57:06.840
were spending a lot of time doing
 

00:57:06.840 --> 00:57:09.170

lot easier and I I hope it's making the
 

00:57:16.500 --> 00:57:17.900
lot easier and I I hope it's making the
lives easier for other groups who are

00:57:17.900 --> 00:57:17.910
lives easier for other groups who are
 

00:57:17.910 --> 00:57:20.030

01:00:00.089 --> 01:00:00.099
in a really pure sense where where
 

01:00:00.099 --> 01:00:01.740
in a really pure sense where where
you're sharing every single piece of

01:00:01.740 --> 01:00:01.750
you're sharing every single piece of
 

01:00:01.750 --> 01:00:03.960
you're sharing every single piece of
information that you that you do but

01:00:03.960 --> 01:00:03.970
information that you that you do but
 

01:00:03.970 --> 01:00:05.370
information that you that you do but
it's a people are sharing the

01:00:05.370 --> 01:00:05.380
it's a people are sharing the
 

01:00:05.380 --> 01:00:08.759
it's a people are sharing the
information that they there ready to an

information that they there ready to an
 

01:00:08.769 --> 01:00:11.039
information that they there ready to an
unhappy to share and it's been very

01:00:11.039 --> 01:00:11.049
unhappy to share and it's been very
 

01:00:11.049 --> 01:00:13.980
unhappy to share and it's been very
useful to a lot of people and so one

01:00:13.980 --> 01:00:13.990
useful to a lot of people and so one
 

01:00:13.990 --> 01:00:15.720
useful to a lot of people and so one

there's been this democratization of

01:00:23.210 --> 01:00:23.220
there's been this democratization of
 

01:00:23.220 --> 01:00:26.039
there's been this democratization of
access to information you know from from

today there's also been a
democratization of fabrication which is

01:00:35.549 --> 01:00:35.559
democratization of fabrication which is

is that it means that information is

01:01:06.240 --> 01:01:06.250
is that it means that information is
 

01:01:06.250 --> 01:01:08.940
is that it means that information is
becoming critical if you have access to

01:01:08.940 --> 01:01:08.950
becoming critical if you have access to
 

01:01:08.950 --> 01:01:11.009
becoming critical if you have access to
to the information you need to do

striking example of this was about in

01:01:17.759 --> 01:01:17.769
striking example of this was about in
 

01:01:17.769 --> 01:01:22.049
striking example of this was about in
2005 the the complete genome sequence

01:01:22.049 --> 01:01:22.059
2005 the the complete genome sequence
 

01:01:22.059 --> 01:01:27.299
2005 the the complete genome sequence
for the 1918 flu was published and quite

01:01:27.299 --> 01:01:27.309
for the 1918 flu was published and quite
 

01:01:27.309 --> 01:01:29.249

shortly after a second paper was

01:01:29.249 --> 01:01:29.259
shortly after a second paper was
 

01:01:29.259 --> 01:01:32.430
shortly after a second paper was
published this one here in science where

01:01:32.430 --> 01:01:32.440
published this one here in science where
 

01:01:32.440 --> 01:01:35.460
published this one here in science where
they had they synthesized that that

01:01:35.460 --> 01:01:35.470
they had they synthesized that that
 

01:01:35.470 --> 01:01:38.579
they had they synthesized that that
genome the flu genome and they they they

01:01:38.579 --> 01:01:38.589
genome the flu genome and they they they
 

01:01:38.589 --> 01:01:40.410
genome the flu genome and they they they
got it work and they basically booted up

01:01:40.410 --> 01:01:40.420
got it work and they basically booted up
 

01:01:40.420 --> 01:01:42.990
got it work and they basically booted up
that that that virus and they showed

01:01:42.990 --> 01:01:43.000
that that that virus and they showed
 

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:44.970
that that that virus and they showed
that the virus has the app has the

01:01:44.970 --> 01:01:44.980
that the virus has the app has the
 

01:01:44.980 --> 01:01:46.980
that the virus has the app has the
ability to replicate in the absence of

embryonated chicken eggs and displayed a
 

01:01:51.400 --> 01:01:53.509
embryonated chicken eggs and displayed a
high growth phenotype in human bronchial

01:01:53.509 --> 01:01:53.519

cells basically they made the most one

01:01:57.450 --> 01:01:57.460
cells basically they made the most one
 

01:01:57.460 --> 01:01:59.880
cells basically they made the most one
of the most the worst pandemic viruses

01:01:59.880 --> 01:01:59.890
of the most the worst pandemic viruses
 

01:01:59.890 --> 01:02:01.230
of the most the worst pandemic viruses
that we've had in our history and they

01:02:01.230 --> 01:02:01.240
that we've had in our history and they
 

01:02:01.240 --> 01:02:04.440
that we've had in our history and they
showed that it worked and and why were

01:02:04.440 --> 01:02:04.450
showed that it worked and and why were
 

01:02:04.450 --> 01:02:05.550
showed that it worked and and why were
they able to do that they were able to

01:02:05.550 --> 01:02:05.560
they able to do that they were able to
 

01:02:05.560 --> 01:02:08.070
they able to do that they were able to
do that because someone had had shared

01:02:08.070 --> 01:02:08.080
do that because someone had had shared
 

01:02:08.080 --> 01:02:10.170
do that because someone had had shared
the information of the of the DNA

01:02:10.170 --> 01:02:10.180
the information of the of the DNA
 

01:02:10.180 --> 01:02:12.240
the information of the of the DNA
sequence and once that was out there it

01:02:12.240 --> 01:02:12.250
sequence and once that was out there it
 

01:02:12.250 --> 01:02:15.840
sequence and once that was out there it
was easy to make this and do it so so I

01:02:15.840 --> 01:02:15.850
was easy to make this and do it so so I
 

01:02:15.850 --> 01:02:18.840
was easy to make this and do it so so I
bring this issue up because if you can

01:02:18.840 --> 01:02:18.850
bring this issue up because if you can
 

01:02:18.850 --> 01:02:21.180
bring this issue up because if you can
share information you can people will

01:02:21.180 --> 01:02:21.190
share information you can people will
 

01:02:21.190 --> 01:02:22.590
share information you can people will
start doing a lot of things that are

01:02:22.590 --> 01:02:22.600
start doing a lot of things that are
 

01:02:22.600 --> 01:02:24.900
start doing a lot of things that are
either good or good or bad and there's a

01:02:24.900 --> 01:02:24.910
either good or good or bad and there's a
 

01:02:24.910 --> 01:02:26.790
either good or good or bad and there's a
number of different ways we can choose

01:02:26.790 --> 01:02:26.800
number of different ways we can choose
 

01:02:26.800 --> 01:02:29.160
number of different ways we can choose
to to deal with that the first is you

01:02:29.160 --> 01:02:29.170
to to deal with that the first is you
 

01:02:29.170 --> 01:02:30.540
to to deal with that the first is you
could say if you're going to do

01:02:30.540 --> 01:02:30.550
could say if you're going to do
 

01:02:30.550 --> 01:02:32.010
could say if you're going to do
something like if you want to do

01:02:32.010 --> 01:02:32.020
something like if you want to do
 

01:02:32.020 --> 01:02:33.660
something like if you want to do
something like share the sequence of of

01:02:33.660 --> 01:02:33.670
something like share the sequence of of
 

01:02:33.670 --> 01:02:37.050
something like share the sequence of of
the part of the 19 18 flu you shouldn't

01:02:37.050 --> 01:02:37.060
the part of the 19 18 flu you shouldn't
 

01:02:37.060 --> 01:02:38.760
the part of the 19 18 flu you shouldn't
do that that's going to be regulated

01:02:38.760 --> 01:02:38.770
do that that's going to be regulated
 

01:02:38.770 --> 01:02:41.340
do that that's going to be regulated
it's going to happen in a federal lab or

01:02:41.340 --> 01:02:41.350
it's going to happen in a federal lab or
 

01:02:41.350 --> 01:02:43.440
it's going to happen in a federal lab or
a second approach is you can say which

01:02:43.440 --> 01:02:43.450
a second approach is you can say which
 

01:02:43.450 --> 01:02:46.020
a second approach is you can say which
is what we do now we say you can do that

01:02:46.020 --> 01:02:46.030
is what we do now we say you can do that
 

01:02:46.030 --> 01:02:47.460
is what we do now we say you can do that
work and then you have to publish it in

01:02:47.460 --> 01:02:47.470
work and then you have to publish it in
 

01:02:47.470 --> 01:02:49.350
work and then you have to publish it in
a in an academic journal so the

01:02:49.350 --> 01:02:49.360
a in an academic journal so the
 

01:02:49.360 --> 01:02:51.090
a in an academic journal so the
information only gets out after the

01:02:51.090 --> 01:02:51.100
information only gets out after the
 

01:02:51.100 --> 01:02:52.800
information only gets out after the
event has happened after someone has

01:02:52.800 --> 01:02:52.810
event has happened after someone has
 

01:02:52.810 --> 01:02:55.200
event has happened after someone has
made the flu virus third approach is

01:02:55.200 --> 01:02:55.210
made the flu virus third approach is
 

01:02:55.210 --> 01:02:57.570
made the flu virus third approach is
that if people were adhering to the sort

01:02:57.570 --> 01:02:57.580
that if people were adhering to the sort
 

01:02:57.580 --> 01:02:59.220
that if people were adhering to the sort
of an open science approach and they

01:02:59.220 --> 01:02:59.230
of an open science approach and they
 

01:02:59.230 --> 01:03:00.720
of an open science approach and they
were discussing their work as they

01:03:00.720 --> 01:03:00.730
were discussing their work as they
 

01:03:00.730 --> 01:03:02.940
were discussing their work as they
planned it and as it happened then

01:03:02.940 --> 01:03:02.950
planned it and as it happened then
 

01:03:02.950 --> 01:03:05.430
planned it and as it happened then
people would be able to to comment on

01:03:05.430 --> 01:03:05.440
people would be able to to comment on
 

01:03:05.440 --> 01:03:07.020
people would be able to to comment on
work like this where people are making

01:03:07.020 --> 01:03:07.030
work like this where people are making
 

01:03:07.030 --> 01:03:09.540
work like this where people are making
dangerous flus and would be able to

01:03:09.540 --> 01:03:09.550
dangerous flus and would be able to
 

01:03:09.550 --> 01:03:11.370
dangerous flus and would be able to
either decide how to respond to it or

01:03:11.370 --> 01:03:11.380
either decide how to respond to it or
 

01:03:11.380 --> 01:03:13.260
either decide how to respond to it or
whether to to try and get these people

01:03:13.260 --> 01:03:13.270
whether to to try and get these people
 

01:03:13.270 --> 01:03:16.860
whether to to try and get these people
to do something different and but so

01:03:16.860 --> 01:03:16.870
to do something different and but so
 

01:03:16.870 --> 01:03:18.270
to do something different and but so
that's it that's another that's another

01:03:18.270 --> 01:03:18.280
that's it that's another that's another
 

01:03:18.280 --> 01:03:20.940
that's it that's another that's another
option the current option is that nobody

01:03:20.940 --> 01:03:20.950
option the current option is that nobody
 

01:03:20.950 --> 01:03:22.650
option the current option is that nobody
talks about anything until after they've

01:03:22.650 --> 01:03:22.660
talks about anything until after they've
 

01:03:22.660 --> 01:03:24.480
talks about anything until after they've
done it and that can be that can be a

01:03:24.480 --> 01:03:24.490
done it and that can be that can be a
 

01:03:24.490 --> 01:03:26.130
done it and that can be that can be a
dangerous thing so that's all I wanted

01:03:26.130 --> 01:03:26.140
dangerous thing so that's all I wanted
 

01:03:26.140 --> 01:03:27.900
dangerous thing so that's all I wanted
to say and just to summarize open

01:03:27.900 --> 01:03:27.910
to say and just to summarize open
 

01:03:27.910 --> 01:03:30.060
to say and just to summarize open
science can work it's worked in my own

01:03:30.060 --> 01:03:30.070
science can work it's worked in my own
 

01:03:30.070 --> 01:03:32.490
science can work it's worked in my own
case and that might not always be true

01:03:32.490 --> 01:03:32.500
case and that might not always be true
 

01:03:32.500 --> 01:03:34.170
case and that might not always be true
I've been I've been lucky in that I work

01:03:34.170 --> 01:03:34.180
I've been I've been lucky in that I work
 

01:03:34.180 --> 01:03:36.030
I've been I've been lucky in that I work
in a discipline where where it's

01:03:36.030 --> 01:03:36.040
in a discipline where where it's
 

01:03:36.040 --> 01:03:38.840
in a discipline where where it's
relatively accepted and finally

01:03:38.840 --> 01:03:38.850
relatively accepted and finally
 

01:03:38.850 --> 01:03:41.730

information distribution is becoming

01:03:41.730 --> 01:03:41.740
information distribution is becoming
 

01:03:41.740 --> 01:03:43.410
information distribution is becoming
increasingly consequential because once

01:03:43.410 --> 01:03:43.420
increasingly consequential because once
 

01:03:43.420 --> 01:03:45.360
increasingly consequential because once
you have the information you can do a

01:03:45.360 --> 01:03:45.370
you have the information you can do a
 

01:03:45.370 --> 01:03:49.520
you have the information you can do a
lot of things so thank you very much I

01:03:49.520 --> 01:03:49.530
 

01:03:49.530 --> 01:03:52.800
noticed that most of you have google

01:03:52.800 --> 01:03:52.810
noticed that most of you have google
 

01:03:52.810 --> 01:03:56.340
noticed that most of you have google

for your solutions and you're talking
 

01:03:58.690 --> 01:04:02.820
for your solutions and you're talking
about information being open personally

01:04:02.820 --> 01:04:02.830
about information being open personally
 

01:04:02.830 --> 01:04:04.270
about information being open personally
how do you feel about Google

01:04:04.270 --> 01:04:04.280
how do you feel about Google
 

01:04:04.280 --> 01:04:06.940
how do you feel about Google
presence with holding information and

01:04:06.940 --> 01:04:06.950
presence with holding information and
 

01:04:06.950 --> 01:04:10.360
presence with holding information and
how that's going to interact with your

01:04:10.360 --> 01:04:10.370
how that's going to interact with your
 

01:04:10.370 --> 01:04:16.240
how that's going to interact with your
hope to open up science ever think about

01:04:16.240 --> 01:04:16.250
hope to open up science ever think about
 

01:04:16.250 --> 01:04:19.990
hope to open up science ever think about
Google you well experiencing yeah I mean

01:04:19.990 --> 01:04:20.000
Google you well experiencing yeah I mean
 

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:21.790
Google you well experiencing yeah I mean
I i love google i mean google is

01:04:21.790 --> 01:04:21.800
I i love google i mean google is
 

01:04:21.800 --> 01:04:23.710
I i love google i mean google is
permitted us to do things that otherwise

01:04:23.710 --> 01:04:23.720
permitted us to do things that otherwise
 

01:04:23.720 --> 01:04:25.630
permitted us to do things that otherwise
you know would have been very expensive

01:04:25.630 --> 01:04:25.640
you know would have been very expensive
 

01:04:25.640 --> 01:04:27.700
you know would have been very expensive
to do i mean the reason that i use those

01:04:27.700 --> 01:04:27.710
to do i mean the reason that i use those
 

01:04:27.710 --> 01:04:30.640
to do i mean the reason that i use those
specific tools is because i want if

01:04:30.640 --> 01:04:30.650
specific tools is because i want if
 

01:04:30.650 --> 01:04:32.680
specific tools is because i want if
anyone's interested in any part of what

01:04:32.680 --> 01:04:32.690
anyone's interested in any part of what
 

01:04:32.690 --> 01:04:34.150
anyone's interested in any part of what
we're doing that overnight they can

01:04:34.150 --> 01:04:34.160
we're doing that overnight they can
 

01:04:34.160 --> 01:04:35.980
we're doing that overnight they can
replicate it and so if we use a Google

01:04:35.980 --> 01:04:35.990
replicate it and so if we use a Google
 

01:04:35.990 --> 01:04:37.990
replicate it and so if we use a Google
spreadsheet I know for a fact that that

01:04:37.990 --> 01:04:38.000
spreadsheet I know for a fact that that
 

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.210
spreadsheet I know for a fact that that
will scale we can get you know you can

01:04:40.210 --> 01:04:40.220
will scale we can get you know you can
 

01:04:40.220 --> 01:04:43.090
will scale we can get you know you can
use it immediately Google's been pretty

01:04:43.090 --> 01:04:43.100
use it immediately Google's been pretty
 

01:04:43.100 --> 01:04:44.260
use it immediately Google's been pretty
good overall I mean the you know

01:04:44.260 --> 01:04:44.270
good overall I mean the you know
 

01:04:44.270 --> 01:04:45.850
good overall I mean the you know
recently there was the Google research

01:04:45.850 --> 01:04:45.860
recently there was the Google research
 

01:04:45.860 --> 01:04:48.430
recently there was the Google research
stocks that was supposed to happen and

01:04:48.430 --> 01:04:48.440
stocks that was supposed to happen and
 

01:04:48.440 --> 01:04:51.010
stocks that was supposed to happen and
they didn't that's unusual I mean

01:04:51.010 --> 01:04:51.020
they didn't that's unusual I mean
 

01:04:51.020 --> 01:04:52.600
they didn't that's unusual I mean
usually you know that they keep

01:04:52.600 --> 01:04:52.610
usually you know that they keep
 

01:04:52.610 --> 01:04:55.510
usually you know that they keep
improving it but again you know these

01:04:55.510 --> 01:04:55.520
improving it but again you know these
 

01:04:55.520 --> 01:04:58.390
improving it but again you know these
these documents if down the road Google

01:04:58.390 --> 01:04:58.400
these documents if down the road Google
 

01:04:58.400 --> 01:04:59.740
these documents if down the road Google
decides of not continue Google

01:04:59.740 --> 01:04:59.750
decides of not continue Google
 

01:04:59.750 --> 01:05:01.450
decides of not continue Google
Spreadsheets doesn't really concern me I

01:05:01.450 --> 01:05:01.460
Spreadsheets doesn't really concern me I
 

01:05:01.460 --> 01:05:03.340
Spreadsheets doesn't really concern me I
mean basically we can move it over to

01:05:03.340 --> 01:05:03.350
mean basically we can move it over to
 

01:05:03.350 --> 01:05:05.440
mean basically we can move it over to
another platform and at that point you

01:05:05.440 --> 01:05:05.450
another platform and at that point you
 

01:05:05.450 --> 01:05:06.730
another platform and at that point you
know if we have to buy something we'll

01:05:06.730 --> 01:05:06.740
know if we have to buy something we'll
 

01:05:06.740 --> 01:05:09.250
know if we have to buy something we'll
do it but i don't i think that the trend

01:05:09.250 --> 01:05:09.260
do it but i don't i think that the trend
 

01:05:09.260 --> 01:05:11.440
do it but i don't i think that the trend
is to have more companies make available

01:05:11.440 --> 01:05:11.450
is to have more companies make available
 

01:05:11.450 --> 01:05:13.660
is to have more companies make available
these kinds of platforms for free rather

01:05:13.660 --> 01:05:13.670
these kinds of platforms for free rather
 

01:05:13.670 --> 01:05:15.550
these kinds of platforms for free rather
than going backwards I don't know what

01:05:15.550 --> 01:05:15.560
than going backwards I don't know what
 

01:05:15.560 --> 01:05:19.780
than going backwards I don't know what
you guys think yeah I mean we we use

01:05:19.780 --> 01:05:19.790
you guys think yeah I mean we we use
 

01:05:19.790 --> 01:05:22.600
you guys think yeah I mean we we use
Google Spreadsheets a lot as well not in

01:05:22.600 --> 01:05:22.610
Google Spreadsheets a lot as well not in
 

01:05:22.610 --> 01:05:24.160
Google Spreadsheets a lot as well not in
quite a sophisticated away but we found

01:05:24.160 --> 01:05:24.170
quite a sophisticated away but we found
 

01:05:24.170 --> 01:05:25.840
quite a sophisticated away but we found
them really really helpful as a as a

01:05:25.840 --> 01:05:25.850
them really really helpful as a as a
 

01:05:25.850 --> 01:05:29.440
them really really helpful as a as a
tool in our lab and so for the moment

01:05:29.440 --> 01:05:29.450
tool in our lab and so for the moment
 

01:05:29.450 --> 01:05:41.859
tool in our lab and so for the moment
we're trusting them

01:05:41.859 --> 01:05:41.869
 

01:05:41.869 --> 01:05:43.520
thank you very much for the presentation

01:05:43.520 --> 01:05:43.530
thank you very much for the presentation
 

01:05:43.530 --> 01:05:46.400
thank you very much for the presentation
I enjoyed the presentation but I have a

01:05:46.400 --> 01:05:46.410
I enjoyed the presentation but I have a
 

01:05:46.410 --> 01:05:49.310
I enjoyed the presentation but I have a
fundamental question about whether these

01:05:49.310 --> 01:05:49.320
fundamental question about whether these
 

01:05:49.320 --> 01:05:53.660
fundamental question about whether these
projects are scalable to being the core

01:05:53.660 --> 01:05:53.670
projects are scalable to being the core
 

01:05:53.670 --> 01:05:55.550
projects are scalable to being the core
of mainstream science I mean it seems to

01:05:55.550 --> 01:05:55.560
of mainstream science I mean it seems to
 

01:05:55.560 --> 01:05:57.500
of mainstream science I mean it seems to
me that I'm not an economist if there's

01:05:57.500 --> 01:05:57.510
me that I'm not an economist if there's
 

01:05:57.510 --> 01:05:59.150
me that I'm not an economist if there's
one here I'd appreciate his comments on

01:05:59.150 --> 01:05:59.160
one here I'd appreciate his comments on
 

01:05:59.160 --> 01:06:01.010
one here I'd appreciate his comments on
this but it seems to me that currently

01:06:01.010 --> 01:06:01.020
this but it seems to me that currently
 

01:06:01.020 --> 01:06:03.710
this but it seems to me that currently
the economic infrastructure of science

01:06:03.710 --> 01:06:03.720
the economic infrastructure of science
 

01:06:03.720 --> 01:06:05.870
the economic infrastructure of science
is based on the holding of private

01:06:05.870 --> 01:06:05.880
is based on the holding of private
 

01:06:05.880 --> 01:06:09.290
is based on the holding of private
information by competitive agents in a

01:06:09.290 --> 01:06:09.300
information by competitive agents in a
 

01:06:09.300 --> 01:06:11.300
information by competitive agents in a
large science marketplace that competes

01:06:11.300 --> 01:06:11.310
large science marketplace that competes
 

01:06:11.310 --> 01:06:13.700
large science marketplace that competes
for funding and I don't understand how

01:06:13.700 --> 01:06:13.710
for funding and I don't understand how
 

01:06:13.710 --> 01:06:15.500
for funding and I don't understand how
this system is I mean you would little

01:06:15.500 --> 01:06:15.510
this system is I mean you would little
 

01:06:15.510 --> 01:06:17.180
this system is I mean you would little
what you're talking about is to subvert

01:06:17.180 --> 01:06:17.190
what you're talking about is to subvert
 

01:06:17.190 --> 01:06:20.329
what you're talking about is to subvert
the entire funding distribution system

01:06:20.329 --> 01:06:20.339
the entire funding distribution system
 

01:06:20.339 --> 01:06:22.640
the entire funding distribution system
of science I mean it's by quite more so

01:06:22.640 --> 01:06:22.650
of science I mean it's by quite more so
 

01:06:22.650 --> 01:06:24.680
of science I mean it's by quite more so
it may be much more subversive than you

01:06:24.680 --> 01:06:24.690
it may be much more subversive than you
 

01:06:24.690 --> 01:06:31.450
it may be much more subversive than you
realize yes this is very subversive what

01:06:31.450 --> 01:06:31.460
realize yes this is very subversive what
 

01:06:31.460 --> 01:06:34.390
realize yes this is very subversive what
the different areas of science are

01:06:34.390 --> 01:06:34.400
the different areas of science are
 

01:06:34.400 --> 01:06:36.620
the different areas of science are
responding to this differently because

01:06:36.620 --> 01:06:36.630
responding to this differently because
 

01:06:36.630 --> 01:06:40.280
responding to this differently because
of limited resources how easy it is to

01:06:40.280 --> 01:06:40.290
of limited resources how easy it is to
 

01:06:40.290 --> 01:06:43.190
of limited resources how easy it is to
replicate somebody else's work so I

01:06:43.190 --> 01:06:43.200
replicate somebody else's work so I
 

01:06:43.200 --> 01:06:46.520
replicate somebody else's work so I
think and what are the possible rewards

01:06:46.520 --> 01:06:46.530
think and what are the possible rewards
 

01:06:46.530 --> 01:06:50.450
think and what are the possible rewards
is patent money fame Nobel prizes stuff

01:06:50.450 --> 01:06:50.460
is patent money fame Nobel prizes stuff
 

01:06:50.460 --> 01:06:53.750
is patent money fame Nobel prizes stuff
like that so the the secretiveness is

01:06:53.750 --> 01:06:53.760
like that so the the secretiveness is
 

01:06:53.760 --> 01:06:56.030
like that so the the secretiveness is
the greatest in areas where it's easy to

01:06:56.030 --> 01:06:56.040
the greatest in areas where it's easy to
 

01:06:56.040 --> 01:06:59.300
the greatest in areas where it's easy to
scoop and where the rewards are

01:06:59.300 --> 01:06:59.310
scoop and where the rewards are
 

01:06:59.310 --> 01:07:01.970
scoop and where the rewards are
potentially really big where expense of

01:07:01.970 --> 01:07:01.980
potentially really big where expense of
 

01:07:01.980 --> 01:07:04.460
potentially really big where expense of
doing stuff is big and where there is a

01:07:04.460 --> 01:07:04.470
doing stuff is big and where there is a
 

01:07:04.470 --> 01:07:06.650
doing stuff is big and where there is a
lot of competition think cancer research

01:07:06.650 --> 01:07:06.660
lot of competition think cancer research
 

01:07:06.660 --> 01:07:08.690
lot of competition think cancer research
they're not going to say anything to

they're not going to say anything to
 

01:07:08.700 --> 01:07:12.109
they're not going to say anything to
anybody but there are other areas which

anybody but there are other areas which
 

01:07:12.119 --> 01:07:15.740
anybody but there are other areas which
are much more open let's say ecology you

01:07:15.740 --> 01:07:15.750
are much more open let's say ecology you

don't see their tent in that corner and
you're ten years ahead of them much

01:07:30.710 --> 01:07:30.720
you're ten years ahead of them much
 

01:07:30.720 --> 01:07:33.230
you're ten years ahead of them much
easier to share much easier to do

01:07:33.230 --> 01:07:33.240
easier to share much easier to do
 

01:07:33.240 --> 01:07:35.359
easier to share much easier to do
something like open science because you

01:07:35.359 --> 01:07:35.369
something like open science because you
 

01:07:35.369 --> 01:07:36.920
something like open science because you
don't really have competition you can be

01:07:36.920 --> 01:07:36.930
don't really have competition you can be
 

01:07:36.930 --> 01:07:39.470
don't really have competition you can be
scooped and there's no but no Nobel

01:07:39.470 --> 01:07:39.480
scooped and there's no but no Nobel
 

01:07:39.480 --> 01:07:43.940
scooped and there's no but no Nobel
Prize for ecology so then you know then

01:07:43.940 --> 01:07:43.950
Prize for ecology so then you know then
 

01:07:43.950 --> 01:07:46.120
Prize for ecology so then you know then
you have something in between like

01:07:46.120 --> 01:07:46.130
you have something in between like
 

01:07:46.130 --> 01:07:47.650
you have something in between like
dinosaur paleontology five and a half

01:07:47.650 --> 01:07:47.660
dinosaur paleontology five and a half
 

01:07:47.660 --> 01:07:50.319
dinosaur paleontology five and a half
people have the money to do it but once

01:07:50.319 --> 01:07:50.329
people have the money to do it but once
 

01:07:50.329 --> 01:07:52.900
people have the money to do it but once
you go to some you know god-awful place

01:07:52.900 --> 01:07:52.910
you go to some you know god-awful place
 

01:07:52.910 --> 01:07:55.809
you go to some you know god-awful place
to dig it everybody knows you're there

01:07:55.809 --> 01:07:55.819
to dig it everybody knows you're there
 

01:07:55.819 --> 01:07:57.819
to dig it everybody knows you're there
nobody's going to scoop you you can

01:07:57.819 --> 01:07:57.829
nobody's going to scoop you you can
 

01:07:57.829 --> 01:08:00.490
nobody's going to scoop you you can
absolutely freely take pictures of your

01:08:00.490 --> 01:08:00.500
absolutely freely take pictures of your
 

01:08:00.500 --> 01:08:02.740
absolutely freely take pictures of your
fossil as you're digging it out every

01:08:02.740 --> 01:08:02.750
fossil as you're digging it out every
 

01:08:02.750 --> 01:08:05.470
fossil as you're digging it out every
day and nobody can do anything about it

01:08:05.470 --> 01:08:05.480
day and nobody can do anything about it
 

01:08:05.480 --> 01:08:08.079
day and nobody can do anything about it
you can be scooped you're the one who

01:08:08.079 --> 01:08:08.089
you can be scooped you're the one who
 

01:08:08.089 --> 01:08:10.539
you can be scooped you're the one who
dug it up so different areas are going

01:08:10.539 --> 01:08:10.549
dug it up so different areas are going
 

01:08:10.549 --> 01:08:12.430
dug it up so different areas are going
to be different about it so I think it's

01:08:12.430 --> 01:08:12.440
to be different about it so I think it's
 

01:08:12.440 --> 01:08:14.910
to be different about it so I think it's
going to go in different rates the

01:08:14.910 --> 01:08:14.920
going to go in different rates the
 

01:08:14.920 --> 01:08:19.979
going to go in different rates the
adoption of some or all of these opening

01:08:19.979 --> 01:08:19.989
adoption of some or all of these opening
 

01:08:19.989 --> 01:08:24.519
adoption of some or all of these opening
kind of ideas or ways of doing stuff are

01:08:24.519 --> 01:08:24.529
kind of ideas or ways of doing stuff are
 

01:08:24.529 --> 01:08:26.530
kind of ideas or ways of doing stuff are
going to be adopted different rates in

01:08:26.530 --> 01:08:26.540
going to be adopted different rates in
 

01:08:26.540 --> 01:08:29.499
going to be adopted different rates in
different areas of science yeah and you

01:08:29.499 --> 01:08:29.509
different areas of science yeah and you
 

01:08:29.509 --> 01:08:32.590
different areas of science yeah and you
bring a couple of different issues in

01:08:32.590 --> 01:08:32.600
bring a couple of different issues in
 

01:08:32.600 --> 01:08:34.510
bring a couple of different issues in
terms of funding I think it's actually

01:08:34.510 --> 01:08:34.520
terms of funding I think it's actually
 

01:08:34.520 --> 01:08:35.919
terms of funding I think it's actually
very good for funding I mean the last

01:08:35.919 --> 01:08:35.929
very good for funding I mean the last
 

01:08:35.929 --> 01:08:38.410
very good for funding I mean the last
funding that I got was precisely because

01:08:38.410 --> 01:08:38.420
funding that I got was precisely because
 

01:08:38.420 --> 01:08:40.930
funding that I got was precisely because

friendfeed and you know we've been

01:08:43.660 --> 01:08:43.670
friendfeed and you know we've been
 

01:08:43.670 --> 01:08:45.160

people have been doing Steve Koch's and

01:08:46.689 --> 01:08:46.699
people have been doing Steve Koch's and
 

01:08:46.699 --> 01:08:47.919
people have been doing Steve Koch's and
other one who's been publishing his

other one who's been publishing his
 

01:08:47.929 --> 01:08:50.019
other one who's been publishing his
proposals you know and that attracts

01:08:50.019 --> 01:08:50.029
proposals you know and that attracts
 

01:08:50.029 --> 01:08:51.999
proposals you know and that attracts
collaborators i don't i don't think that

01:08:51.999 --> 01:08:52.009
collaborators i don't i don't think that
 

01:08:52.009 --> 01:08:53.919
collaborators i don't i don't think that
the federal agencies are going to look

01:08:53.919 --> 01:08:53.929
the federal agencies are going to look
 

01:08:53.929 --> 01:08:57.010
the federal agencies are going to look
down at you know sharing fact i think

01:08:57.010 --> 01:08:57.020
down at you know sharing fact i think
 

01:08:57.020 --> 01:08:58.660
down at you know sharing fact i think
it's going to be positive now where

01:08:58.660 --> 01:08:58.670
it's going to be positive now where
 

01:08:58.670 --> 01:09:00.280
it's going to be positive now where
there might be an issue is in the

01:09:00.280 --> 01:09:00.290
there might be an issue is in the
 

01:09:00.290 --> 01:09:02.590
there might be an issue is in the
intellectual property sphere and I

01:09:02.590 --> 01:09:02.600
intellectual property sphere and I
 

01:09:02.600 --> 01:09:04.450
intellectual property sphere and I
definitely agree you I don't think you

01:09:04.450 --> 01:09:04.460
definitely agree you I don't think you
 

01:09:04.460 --> 01:09:07.570
definitely agree you I don't think you
can both pursue at least at mica is open

01:09:07.570 --> 01:09:07.580
can both pursue at least at mica is open
 

01:09:07.580 --> 01:09:09.519
can both pursue at least at mica is open
notebook science and intellectual

01:09:09.519 --> 01:09:09.529
notebook science and intellectual
 

01:09:09.529 --> 01:09:11.349
notebook science and intellectual
property you have to make a decision but

01:09:11.349 --> 01:09:11.359
property you have to make a decision but
 

01:09:11.359 --> 01:09:12.640
property you have to make a decision but
that's nothing new I mean when you

01:09:12.640 --> 01:09:12.650
that's nothing new I mean when you
 

01:09:12.650 --> 01:09:15.579
that's nothing new I mean when you
decide to publish a paper and not file a

01:09:15.579 --> 01:09:15.589
decide to publish a paper and not file a
 

01:09:15.589 --> 01:09:17.169
decide to publish a paper and not file a
patent or provisional patent or whatever

01:09:17.169 --> 01:09:17.179
patent or provisional patent or whatever
 

01:09:17.179 --> 01:09:18.910
patent or provisional patent or whatever
you want you've made a decision so

01:09:18.910 --> 01:09:18.920
you want you've made a decision so
 

01:09:18.920 --> 01:09:20.140
you want you've made a decision so
you're just making it earlier in the

01:09:20.140 --> 01:09:20.150
you're just making it earlier in the
 

01:09:20.150 --> 01:09:22.809
you're just making it earlier in the
process and so the Boris said it's

01:09:22.809 --> 01:09:22.819
process and so the Boris said it's
 

01:09:22.819 --> 01:09:24.430
process and so the Boris said it's
different areas i work in malaria

01:09:24.430 --> 01:09:24.440
different areas i work in malaria
 

01:09:24.440 --> 01:09:26.590
different areas i work in malaria
specifically for that reason I then work

01:09:26.590 --> 01:09:26.600
specifically for that reason I then work
 

01:09:26.600 --> 01:09:27.879
specifically for that reason I then work
in malaria before I did open science

01:09:27.879 --> 01:09:27.889
in malaria before I did open science
 

01:09:27.889 --> 01:09:29.829
in malaria before I did open science
totally different I'm doing that because

01:09:29.829 --> 01:09:29.839
totally different I'm doing that because
 

01:09:29.839 --> 01:09:31.149
totally different I'm doing that because
it's a project that it makes a lot of

01:09:31.149 --> 01:09:31.159
it's a project that it makes a lot of
 

01:09:31.159 --> 01:09:33.729
it's a project that it makes a lot of
sense to be open about the solubility

01:09:33.729 --> 01:09:33.739
sense to be open about the solubility
 

01:09:33.739 --> 01:09:36.070
sense to be open about the solubility
project again I think it's a very good

01:09:36.070 --> 01:09:36.080
project again I think it's a very good
 

01:09:36.080 --> 01:09:38.260
project again I think it's a very good
area because it's easy to do people can

01:09:38.260 --> 01:09:38.270
area because it's easy to do people can
 

01:09:38.270 --> 01:09:40.570
area because it's easy to do people can
share it and everybody can benefit so I

01:09:40.570 --> 01:09:40.580
share it and everybody can benefit so I
 

01:09:40.580 --> 01:09:42.340
share it and everybody can benefit so I
think you know instead of you you might

01:09:42.340 --> 01:09:42.350
think you know instead of you you might
 

01:09:42.350 --> 01:09:44.320
think you know instead of you you might
end up collaborating with someone who

01:09:44.320 --> 01:09:44.330
end up collaborating with someone who
 

01:09:44.330 --> 01:09:46.059
end up collaborating with someone who
might be your competitor in another

01:09:46.059 --> 01:09:46.069
might be your competitor in another
 

01:09:46.069 --> 01:09:47.950
might be your competitor in another
world I think that's that's what we're

01:09:47.950 --> 01:09:47.960
world I think that's that's what we're
 

01:09:47.960 --> 01:09:53.050
world I think that's that's what we're
finding let me give you a related but

01:09:53.050 --> 01:09:53.060
finding let me give you a related but
 

01:09:53.060 --> 01:09:55.270
finding let me give you a related but
different experience I'm not in the lab

01:09:55.270 --> 01:09:55.280
different experience I'm not in the lab
 

01:09:55.280 --> 01:09:55.930
different experience I'm not in the lab
anymore

01:09:55.930 --> 01:09:55.940
anymore
 

01:09:55.940 --> 01:09:57.820
anymore
being in like five or six years anymore

01:09:57.820 --> 01:09:57.830
being in like five or six years anymore
 

01:09:57.830 --> 01:10:00.790
being in like five or six years anymore
that doesn't mean my mind is not a

01:10:00.790 --> 01:10:00.800
that doesn't mean my mind is not a
 

01:10:00.800 --> 01:10:03.340
that doesn't mean my mind is not a
scientific mind anymore I have ideas I

01:10:03.340 --> 01:10:03.350
scientific mind anymore I have ideas I
 

01:10:03.350 --> 01:10:05.979
scientific mind anymore I have ideas I
just don't have a lab to do that about

01:10:05.979 --> 01:10:05.989
just don't have a lab to do that about
 

01:10:05.989 --> 01:10:07.959
just don't have a lab to do that about
three three-and-a-half years ago I

01:10:07.959 --> 01:10:07.969
three three-and-a-half years ago I
 

01:10:07.969 --> 01:10:11.320
three three-and-a-half years ago I
posted a hypothesis on my blog ok look

01:10:11.320 --> 01:10:11.330
posted a hypothesis on my blog ok look
 

01:10:11.330 --> 01:10:13.209
posted a hypothesis on my blog ok look
ok if anybody's interested you know you

01:10:13.209 --> 01:10:13.219
ok if anybody's interested you know you
 

01:10:13.219 --> 01:10:15.820
ok if anybody's interested you know you
have resources go do it I really like to

01:10:15.820 --> 01:10:15.830
have resources go do it I really like to
 

01:10:15.830 --> 01:10:17.620
have resources go do it I really like to
see this hypothesis test it is no way I

01:10:17.620 --> 01:10:17.630
see this hypothesis test it is no way I
 

01:10:17.630 --> 01:10:20.830
see this hypothesis test it is no way I
can do it i'm blogging and writing and

01:10:20.830 --> 01:10:20.840
can do it i'm blogging and writing and
 

01:10:20.840 --> 01:10:23.160
can do it i'm blogging and writing and
doing other stuff i don't have a lab

01:10:23.160 --> 01:10:23.170
doing other stuff i don't have a lab
 

01:10:23.170 --> 01:10:25.570
doing other stuff i don't have a lab
well three years three and a half years

01:10:25.570 --> 01:10:25.580
well three years three and a half years

well three years three and a half years
passed and i get an email out of the

01:10:27.640 --> 01:10:27.650
passed and i get an email out of the
 

01:10:27.650 --> 01:10:30.550
passed and i get an email out of the
blue from you know Cornell we would like

01:10:30.550 --> 01:10:30.560
blue from you know Cornell we would like
 

01:10:30.560 --> 01:10:33.189
blue from you know Cornell we would like
to test your hypotheses I said go ahead

01:10:33.189 --> 01:10:33.199
to test your hypotheses I said go ahead
 

01:10:33.199 --> 01:10:35.740
to test your hypotheses I said go ahead
just the you know once it's published

01:10:35.740 --> 01:10:35.750
just the you know once it's published
 

01:10:35.750 --> 01:10:38.200
just the you know once it's published
just so let the people know where the

01:10:38.200 --> 01:10:38.210
just so let the people know where the
 

01:10:38.210 --> 01:10:39.850
just so let the people know where the
hypothesis come from I would like to see

01:10:39.850 --> 01:10:39.860
hypothesis come from I would like to see
 

01:10:39.860 --> 01:10:42.910
hypothesis come from I would like to see
my name in print as much as that and

01:10:42.910 --> 01:10:42.920
my name in print as much as that and
 

01:10:42.920 --> 01:10:45.550
my name in print as much as that and
said no no we want to collaborate with

01:10:45.550 --> 01:10:45.560
said no no we want to collaborate with
 

01:10:45.560 --> 01:10:47.470
said no no we want to collaborate with
you will do the field work you analyze

01:10:47.470 --> 01:10:47.480
you will do the field work you analyze
 

01:10:47.480 --> 01:10:51.160
you will do the field work you analyze
the data and we write a paper asset yeah

01:10:51.160 --> 01:10:51.170
the data and we write a paper asset yeah
 

01:10:51.170 --> 01:10:54.479
the data and we write a paper asset yeah
of course I mean why not I can do that

01:10:54.479 --> 01:10:54.489
of course I mean why not I can do that
 

01:10:54.489 --> 01:10:57.760
of course I mean why not I can do that
yeah I think we've seen similar sort of

01:10:57.760 --> 01:10:57.770
yeah I think we've seen similar sort of
 

01:10:57.770 --> 01:10:59.770
yeah I think we've seen similar sort of
things where we're being open has has

01:10:59.770 --> 01:10:59.780
things where we're being open has has
 

01:10:59.780 --> 01:11:01.570
things where we're being open has has
led to new collaborations and new

01:11:01.570 --> 01:11:01.580
led to new collaborations and new
 

01:11:01.580 --> 01:11:03.760
led to new collaborations and new
connections with people from other from

people who have a different skill set

01:11:05.620 --> 01:11:05.630
people who have a different skill set
 

01:11:05.630 --> 01:11:08.050
people who have a different skill set
than you and that that those

01:11:08.050 --> 01:11:08.060
than you and that that those
 

01:11:08.060 --> 01:11:09.910
than you and that that those
collaborations can lead to you know very

01:11:09.910 --> 01:11:09.920
collaborations can lead to you know very
 

01:11:09.920 --> 01:11:11.979
collaborations can lead to you know very
traditional forms of academic reward you

01:11:11.979 --> 01:11:11.989
traditional forms of academic reward you
 

01:11:11.989 --> 01:11:14.410
traditional forms of academic reward you
know like like papers and funding open

01:11:14.410 --> 01:11:14.420
know like like papers and funding open
 

01:11:14.420 --> 01:11:15.939
know like like papers and funding open
wetware for example has a million

01:11:15.939 --> 01:11:15.949
wetware for example has a million
 

01:11:15.949 --> 01:11:18.520
wetware for example has a million
dollars in NSF funding so that the

01:11:18.520 --> 01:11:18.530
dollars in NSF funding so that the
 

01:11:18.530 --> 01:11:20.979
dollars in NSF funding so that the
traditional structure is certainly open

01:11:20.979 --> 01:11:20.989
traditional structure is certainly open
 

01:11:20.989 --> 01:11:24.670
traditional structure is certainly open
to these sort of ideas I would say are

01:11:24.670 --> 01:11:24.680
to these sort of ideas I would say are
 

01:11:24.680 --> 01:11:27.760
to these sort of ideas I would say are
increasingly so at least thanks

01:11:27.760 --> 01:11:27.770
increasingly so at least thanks
 

01:11:27.770 --> 01:11:30.790
increasingly so at least thanks
everybody this has been great i'm really

01:11:30.790 --> 01:11:30.800
everybody this has been great i'm really
 

01:11:30.800 --> 01:11:34.390
everybody this has been great i'm really
enthusiastic about all this and i'm

01:11:34.390 --> 01:11:34.400
enthusiastic about all this and i'm
 

01:11:34.400 --> 01:11:35.860
enthusiastic about all this and i'm
going to throw in this wild concept that

01:11:35.860 --> 01:11:35.870
going to throw in this wild concept that
 

01:11:35.870 --> 01:11:37.479
going to throw in this wild concept that
this all goes back to Marshall McLuhan

01:11:37.479 --> 01:11:37.489
this all goes back to Marshall McLuhan
 

01:11:37.489 --> 01:11:40.720
this all goes back to Marshall McLuhan
and the medium is the message the reason

01:11:40.720 --> 01:11:40.730
and the medium is the message the reason

science is changing is because the

01:11:43.180 --> 01:11:43.190
science is changing is because the
 

01:11:43.190 --> 01:11:46.209
science is changing is because the
distribution mechanisms for information

01:11:46.209 --> 01:11:46.219
distribution mechanisms for information
 

01:11:46.219 --> 01:11:49.750
distribution mechanisms for information
have changed none of you addressed what

01:11:49.750 --> 01:11:49.760
have changed none of you addressed what
 

01:11:49.760 --> 01:11:52.000
have changed none of you addressed what
I think is probably the weakest part of

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:52.010
I think is probably the weakest part of
 

01:11:52.010 --> 01:11:54.640
I think is probably the weakest part of
contemporary science which is the review

01:11:54.640 --> 01:11:54.650
contemporary science which is the review
 

01:11:54.650 --> 01:11:57.760
contemporary science which is the review
process in fact what I've seen is that

01:11:57.760 --> 01:11:57.770
process in fact what I've seen is that
 

01:11:57.770 --> 01:11:59.740
process in fact what I've seen is that
people don't have time to do adequate

01:11:59.740 --> 01:11:59.750
people don't have time to do adequate
 

01:11:59.750 --> 01:12:01.750
people don't have time to do adequate
peer review and they don't have the

01:12:01.750 --> 01:12:01.760
peer review and they don't have the
 

01:12:01.760 --> 01:12:03.490
peer review and they don't have the
motivation to do adequate peer review

01:12:03.490 --> 01:12:03.500
motivation to do adequate peer review
 

01:12:03.500 --> 01:12:05.120
motivation to do adequate peer review
and that

01:12:05.120 --> 01:12:05.130
and that
 

01:12:05.130 --> 01:12:06.910
and that
one has the experience of submitting

01:12:06.910 --> 01:12:06.920
one has the experience of submitting
 

01:12:06.920 --> 01:12:09.320
one has the experience of submitting
hard work to peer review and getting

01:12:09.320 --> 01:12:09.330
hard work to peer review and getting
 

01:12:09.330 --> 01:12:11.480
hard work to peer review and getting
reviews back that make no sense and

01:12:11.480 --> 01:12:11.490
reviews back that make no sense and
 

01:12:11.490 --> 01:12:14.450
reviews back that make no sense and
having very little recourse and I wonder

01:12:14.450 --> 01:12:14.460
having very little recourse and I wonder
 

01:12:14.460 --> 01:12:17.780
having very little recourse and I wonder
if there if any of you have any ideas as

01:12:17.780 --> 01:12:17.790
if there if any of you have any ideas as
 

01:12:17.790 --> 01:12:20.780
if there if any of you have any ideas as
to how the existence of this new

01:12:20.780 --> 01:12:20.790
to how the existence of this new

bi-directional communication medium will

01:12:23.630 --> 01:12:23.640
bi-directional communication medium will
 

01:12:23.640 --> 01:12:27.470
bi-directional communication medium will
change the way things move from informal

01:12:27.470 --> 01:12:27.480
change the way things move from informal
 

01:12:27.480 --> 01:12:29.720
change the way things move from informal
hypothetical science to formal

peer-reviewed science yeah I mean I'm

01:12:34.490 --> 01:12:34.500
peer-reviewed science yeah I mean I'm
 

01:12:34.500 --> 01:12:36.320
peer-reviewed science yeah I mean I'm
sure you have a lot to say that for me

01:12:36.320 --> 01:12:36.330
sure you have a lot to say that for me
 

01:12:36.330 --> 01:12:38.420
sure you have a lot to say that for me
it all comes down to the proof versus

01:12:38.420 --> 01:12:38.430
it all comes down to the proof versus
 

01:12:38.430 --> 01:12:41.690
it all comes down to the proof versus
trust if you give enough proof you don't

01:12:41.690 --> 01:12:41.700
trust if you give enough proof you don't
 

01:12:41.700 --> 01:12:43.640
trust if you give enough proof you don't
really need peer review for what you

01:12:43.640 --> 01:12:43.650
really need peer review for what you
 

01:12:43.650 --> 01:12:45.980
really need peer review for what you
think your people think they submit to

01:12:45.980 --> 01:12:45.990
think your people think they submit to
 

01:12:45.990 --> 01:12:47.360
think your people think they submit to
peer review and everything that gets put

01:12:47.360 --> 01:12:47.370
peer review and everything that gets put
 

01:12:47.370 --> 01:12:48.980
peer review and everything that gets put
in that paper gets carefully analyzed

01:12:48.980 --> 01:12:48.990
in that paper gets carefully analyzed
 

01:12:48.990 --> 01:12:51.500
in that paper gets carefully analyzed
and we know that that's not the case but

01:12:51.500 --> 01:12:51.510
and we know that that's not the case but
 

01:12:51.510 --> 01:12:52.670
and we know that that's not the case but
instead of that if you make people

01:12:52.670 --> 01:12:52.680
instead of that if you make people
 

01:12:52.680 --> 01:12:54.920
instead of that if you make people
actually give in full details all the

01:12:54.920 --> 01:12:54.930
actually give in full details all the
 

01:12:54.930 --> 01:12:58.160
actually give in full details all the
proof then at a time in the future when

someone tries to repeat it or someone

01:12:59.750 --> 01:12:59.760
someone tries to repeat it or someone
 

01:12:59.760 --> 01:13:01.790
someone tries to repeat it or someone
tries to use it then they'll be able to

01:13:01.790 --> 01:13:01.800
tries to use it then they'll be able to
 

01:13:01.800 --> 01:13:03.440
tries to use it then they'll be able to
go and find it no one's going to be

01:13:03.440 --> 01:13:03.450
go and find it no one's going to be
 

01:13:03.450 --> 01:13:04.580
go and find it no one's going to be
going through every little piece of

so yeah we didn't talk of much of a peer

01:13:09.080 --> 01:13:09.090
so yeah we didn't talk of much of a peer
 

01:13:09.090 --> 01:13:10.760
so yeah we didn't talk of much of a peer
review I mean pirius really compatible

01:13:10.760 --> 01:13:10.770
review I mean pirius really compatible
 

01:13:10.770 --> 01:13:12.530
review I mean pirius really compatible
with open notebook science now you have

01:13:12.530 --> 01:13:12.540
with open notebook science now you have
 

01:13:12.540 --> 01:13:13.880
with open notebook science now you have
to choose your publishers not

01:13:13.880 --> 01:13:13.890
to choose your publishers not
 

01:13:13.890 --> 01:13:16.040
to choose your publishers not
necessarily yet has to be a publisher

that will accept preprints luckily there

01:13:18.860 --> 01:13:18.870
that will accept preprints luckily there
 

01:13:18.870 --> 01:13:20.270
that will accept preprints luckily there
are enough that you know it makes sense

01:13:20.270 --> 01:13:20.280
are enough that you know it makes sense
 

01:13:20.280 --> 01:13:25.070
are enough that you know it makes sense
in most fields and yes and that's one of

01:13:25.070 --> 01:13:25.080
in most fields and yes and that's one of
 

01:13:25.080 --> 01:13:28.820
in most fields and yes and that's one of
the important parts of what we talked

01:13:28.820 --> 01:13:28.830
the important parts of what we talked
 

01:13:28.830 --> 01:13:31.850
the important parts of what we talked
about at plus headquarters every day

01:13:31.850 --> 01:13:31.860
about at plus headquarters every day
 

01:13:31.860 --> 01:13:34.970
about at plus headquarters every day
because it's a it it's a big deal so

01:13:34.970 --> 01:13:34.980
because it's a it it's a big deal so
 

01:13:34.980 --> 01:13:38.210
because it's a it it's a big deal so

okay good my follow-up is that you still

01:15:19.299 --> 01:15:19.309
okay good my follow-up is that you still
 

01:15:19.309 --> 01:15:23.490
okay good my follow-up is that you still
didn't address the the key is that

01:15:23.490 --> 01:15:23.500
didn't address the the key is that
 

01:15:23.500 --> 01:15:25.750
didn't address the the key is that
careers advance on the basis of

publication now I can blog until my head

01:15:28.990 --> 01:15:29.000
publication now I can blog until my head
 

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.689
publication now I can blog until my head
falls off but that's still not going to

01:15:31.689 --> 01:15:31.699
falls off but that's still not going to
 

01:15:31.699 --> 01:15:35.740
falls off but that's still not going to
advance how I look on paper and it's the

01:15:35.740 --> 01:15:35.750
advance how I look on paper and it's the
 

01:15:35.750 --> 01:15:38.709

saying that I've done something valuable

01:15:40.740 --> 01:15:40.750
saying that I've done something valuable
 

01:15:40.750 --> 01:15:44.530
saying that I've done something valuable
that's actually the whole enterprise is

01:15:44.530 --> 01:15:44.540
that's actually the whole enterprise is
 

01:15:44.540 --> 01:15:46.990
that's actually the whole enterprise is
the whole scientific enterprise is based

01:15:46.990 --> 01:15:47.000
the whole scientific enterprise is based
 

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:53.470
the whole scientific enterprise is based
on that and so my question is not just

01:15:53.470 --> 01:15:53.480
on that and so my question is not just
 

01:15:53.480 --> 01:15:55.000
on that and so my question is not just
the value of what goes out there you've

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:55.010
the value of what goes out there you've
 

01:15:55.010 --> 01:15:58.060
the value of what goes out there you've
made a very good case for that but how

01:15:58.060 --> 01:15:58.070
made a very good case for that but how
 

01:15:58.070 --> 01:16:01.319
made a very good case for that but how
the validation will occur so that

01:16:01.319 --> 01:16:01.329
the validation will occur so that
 

01:16:01.329 --> 01:16:03.899
the validation will occur so that
essentially so the grant agencies have

01:16:03.899 --> 01:16:03.909
essentially so the grant agencies have
 

01:16:03.909 --> 01:16:06.729
essentially so the grant agencies have
better information as to who's actually

01:16:06.729 --> 01:16:06.739
better information as to who's actually
 

01:16:06.739 --> 01:16:09.129
better information as to who's actually
you know doing good work and who's just

i'm going to say generation don't mean

01:16:20.620 --> 01:16:20.630
i'm going to say generation don't mean

kind of switch happens that all of these

01:17:21.870 --> 01:17:21.880
kind of switch happens that all of these

kind of switch happens that all of these

that all these other aspects of
contribution to science are going to be

01:17:34.620 --> 01:17:34.630
contribution to science are going to be
 

01:17:34.630 --> 01:17:36.720
contribution to science are going to be
evaluated in some way because it's going

01:17:36.720 --> 01:17:36.730
evaluated in some way because it's going

they're not you know the oldsters
judging the Facebook generation so I

01:17:50.460 --> 01:17:50.470
judging the Facebook generation so I
 

01:17:50.470 --> 01:17:54.330
judging the Facebook generation so I
think there will be a system evolving

01:17:54.330 --> 01:17:54.340
think there will be a system evolving
 

01:17:54.340 --> 01:17:57.330
think there will be a system evolving
over the next 10 years 20 years that is

over the next 10 years 20 years that is
going to then settle down into something

01:17:59.370 --> 01:17:59.380
going to then settle down into something
 

01:17:59.380 --> 01:18:03.480
going to then settle down into something
that works I hope I think I think I see

01:18:03.480 --> 01:18:03.490
that works I hope I think I think I see
 

01:18:03.490 --> 01:18:06.000
that works I hope I think I think I see
evidence of that in my field already for

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:06.010
evidence of that in my field already for

example and if you're a graduate student
 

01:18:08.670 --> 01:18:10.740
example and if you're a graduate student
there would be graduate students who

01:18:10.740 --> 01:18:10.750
there would be graduate students who
 

01:18:10.750 --> 01:18:13.200
there would be graduate students who
could get postdocs postdoc positions in

01:23:28.450 --> 01:23:30.090
committees are going to look at the
measures of your papers and other

01:23:30.090 --> 01:23:30.100
measures of your papers and other
 

01:23:30.100 --> 01:23:33.600
measures of your papers and other
journals in which you publish them well

01:23:33.600 --> 01:23:33.610
journals in which you publish them well
 

01:23:33.610 --> 01:23:34.800
journals in which you publish them well
the committee's are also looking at your

01:23:34.800 --> 01:23:34.810
the committee's are also looking at your
 

01:23:34.810 --> 01:23:37.200
the committee's are also looking at your
reputation which is based partially on

01:23:37.200 --> 01:23:37.210
reputation which is based partially on
 

01:23:37.210 --> 01:23:38.300
reputation which is based partially on
your public

01:23:38.300 --> 01:23:38.310
your public
 

01:23:38.310 --> 01:23:40.280
your public
in different journals but also based on

01:23:40.280 --> 01:23:40.290
in different journals but also based on
 

01:23:40.290 --> 01:23:42.260
in different journals but also based on
your activities in the community so I

01:23:42.260 --> 01:23:42.270
your activities in the community so I
 

01:23:42.270 --> 01:23:43.550
your activities in the community so I
think that's where it comes down to i

01:23:43.550 --> 01:23:43.560
think that's where it comes down to i
 

01:23:43.560 --> 01:23:45.500
think that's where it comes down to i
mean the the recommendation letters of

01:23:45.500 --> 01:23:45.510
mean the the recommendation letters of
 

01:23:45.510 --> 01:23:46.970
mean the the recommendation letters of
recommendation and what people will say

01:23:46.970 --> 01:23:46.980
recommendation and what people will say
 

01:23:46.980 --> 01:23:49.940
recommendation and what people will say
i think that factor is very strongly of

01:23:49.940 --> 01:23:49.950
i think that factor is very strongly of
 

01:23:49.950 --> 01:23:51.710
i think that factor is very strongly of
course if you have no papers and you

01:23:51.710 --> 01:23:51.720
course if you have no papers and you
 

01:23:51.720 --> 01:23:53.300
course if you have no papers and you
have great reputation that's not going

01:23:53.300 --> 01:23:53.310
have great reputation that's not going
 

01:23:53.310 --> 01:23:54.740
have great reputation that's not going
to work but if you have some minimum

01:23:54.740 --> 01:23:54.750
to work but if you have some minimum
 

01:23:54.750 --> 01:23:56.290
to work but if you have some minimum
number and you have a great reputation

01:23:56.290 --> 01:23:56.300
number and you have a great reputation
 

01:23:56.300 --> 01:23:58.160
number and you have a great reputation
that's really where the thing comes

01:23:58.160 --> 01:23:58.170
that's really where the thing comes
 

01:23:58.170 --> 01:23:59.480
that's really where the thing comes
together but yeah bored i'm actually

01:23:59.480 --> 01:23:59.490
together but yeah bored i'm actually
 

01:23:59.490 --> 01:24:00.830
together but yeah bored i'm actually
something really interesting which is

01:24:00.830 --> 01:24:00.840
something really interesting which is
 

01:24:00.840 --> 01:24:02.540
something really interesting which is
the miscommunication about open access i

01:24:02.540 --> 01:24:02.550
the miscommunication about open access i
 

01:24:02.550 --> 01:24:03.860
the miscommunication about open access i
mean there are people who still think

01:24:03.860 --> 01:24:03.870
mean there are people who still think
 

01:24:03.870 --> 01:24:05.690
mean there are people who still think
that you know open access means there's

01:24:05.690 --> 01:24:05.700
that you know open access means there's
 

01:24:05.700 --> 01:24:08.780
that you know open access means there's
no peer review and it has nothing to do

01:24:08.780 --> 01:24:08.790
no peer review and it has nothing to do
 

01:24:08.790 --> 01:24:11.600
no peer review and it has nothing to do
you know with it so i think part of it

01:24:11.600 --> 01:24:11.610
you know with it so i think part of it
 

01:24:11.610 --> 01:24:12.890
you know with it so i think part of it
is you know we have to keep going out

01:24:12.890 --> 01:24:12.900
is you know we have to keep going out
 

01:24:12.900 --> 01:24:14.510
is you know we have to keep going out
and repeating the message what you do

01:24:14.510 --> 01:24:14.520
and repeating the message what you do
 

01:24:14.520 --> 01:24:17.810
and repeating the message what you do
for sure and you know i think people

01:24:17.810 --> 01:24:17.820
for sure and you know i think people
 

01:24:17.820 --> 01:24:20.000
for sure and you know i think people
will get it it's just a question of

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:20.010
will get it it's just a question of
 

01:24:20.010 --> 01:24:22.160
will get it it's just a question of
using it and you know handing your paper

01:24:22.160 --> 01:24:22.170
using it and you know handing your paper
 

01:24:22.170 --> 01:24:23.840
using it and you know handing your paper
over that you publish and open access

01:24:23.840 --> 01:24:23.850
over that you publish and open access
 

01:24:23.850 --> 01:24:26.330
over that you publish and open access
and they're very addictive because once

01:24:26.330 --> 01:24:26.340
and they're very addictive because once
 

01:24:26.340 --> 01:24:28.340
and they're very addictive because once
you've got it as open access journal you

01:24:28.340 --> 01:24:28.350
you've got it as open access journal you
 

01:24:28.350 --> 01:24:30.050
you've got it as open access journal you
know you can share with anybody and then

01:24:30.050 --> 01:24:30.060
know you can share with anybody and then
 

01:24:30.060 --> 01:24:31.130
know you can share with anybody and then
you go back to one of your older

01:24:31.130 --> 01:24:31.140
you go back to one of your older
 

01:24:31.140 --> 01:24:33.560
you go back to one of your older
publications and you can't do that it's

01:24:33.560 --> 01:24:33.570
publications and you can't do that it's
 

01:24:33.570 --> 01:24:35.870
publications and you can't do that it's
really annoying so once people start to

01:24:35.870 --> 01:24:35.880
really annoying so once people start to
 

01:24:35.880 --> 01:24:38.810
really annoying so once people start to
experience it I think makes sense is

01:24:38.810 --> 01:24:38.820
experience it I think makes sense is
 

01:24:38.820 --> 01:24:41.030
experience it I think makes sense is
this is a graduate program process I

01:24:41.030 --> 01:24:41.040
this is a graduate program process I
 

01:24:41.040 --> 01:24:42.940
this is a graduate program process I
think it's going actually fostered and

01:24:42.940 --> 01:24:42.950
think it's going actually fostered and
 

01:24:42.950 --> 01:24:44.960
think it's going actually fostered and
people who started the open access

01:24:44.960 --> 01:24:44.970
people who started the open access
 

01:24:44.970 --> 01:24:47.870
people who started the open access
movement have been envisioned I think I

01:24:47.870 --> 01:24:47.880
movement have been envisioned I think I
 

01:24:47.880 --> 01:24:51.020
movement have been envisioned I think I
think scientists are in generally did

01:24:51.020 --> 01:24:51.030
think scientists are in generally did
 

01:24:51.030 --> 01:24:52.700
think scientists are in generally did
they might not know they don't know

01:24:52.700 --> 01:24:52.710
they might not know they don't know
 

01:24:52.710 --> 01:24:54.320
they might not know they don't know
exactly how to go about it but I think

01:24:54.320 --> 01:24:54.330
exactly how to go about it but I think
 

01:24:54.330 --> 01:24:56.750
exactly how to go about it but I think
they viscerally like the idea of

01:24:56.750 --> 01:24:56.760
they viscerally like the idea of
 

01:24:56.760 --> 01:25:00.050
they viscerally like the idea of
openness and are receptive to the

01:25:00.050 --> 01:25:00.060
openness and are receptive to the
 

01:25:00.060 --> 01:25:02.510
openness and are receptive to the
message they can hear it once did I have

01:25:02.510 --> 01:25:02.520
message they can hear it once did I have

open access journals or depositing in in

01:25:12.790 --> 01:25:12.800
open access journals or depositing in in
 

01:25:12.800 --> 01:25:19.490
open access journals or depositing in in
institutional repositories this you know

01:25:19.490 --> 01:25:19.500
institutional repositories this you know
 

01:25:19.500 --> 01:25:22.160
institutional repositories this you know
it sounds all in theory very nice and

01:25:22.160 --> 01:25:22.170
it sounds all in theory very nice and
 

01:25:22.170 --> 01:25:27.230
it sounds all in theory very nice and
utopian and and equina tech equitable

and everything but I I still would like

and everything but I I still would like
to it seems to me from what you're

01:25:32.450 --> 01:25:32.460
to it seems to me from what you're
 

01:25:32.460 --> 01:25:34.880
to it seems to me from what you're
saying that open access there are

01:25:34.880 --> 01:25:34.890
saying that open access there are
 

01:25:34.890 --> 01:25:36.860
saying that open access there are
certain fields that are lend themselves

01:25:36.860 --> 01:25:36.870
certain fields that are lend themselves
 

01:25:36.870 --> 01:25:39.260
certain fields that are lend themselves
more to open access than others and that

01:25:39.260 --> 01:25:39.270
more to open access than others and that
 

01:25:39.270 --> 01:25:44.060
more to open access than others and that
as this progresses you know there will

01:25:44.060 --> 01:25:44.070
as this progresses you know there will
 

01:25:44.070 --> 01:25:46.070
as this progresses you know there will
be certain areas that go that way in

01:25:46.070 --> 01:25:46.080
be certain areas that go that way in
 

01:25:46.080 --> 01:25:49.640
be certain areas that go that way in
certain areas that continue

01:25:49.640 --> 01:25:49.650
certain areas that continue
 

01:25:49.650 --> 01:25:52.640
certain areas that continue
you know in the old tradition now you

01:25:52.640 --> 01:25:52.650
you know in the old tradition now you
 

01:25:52.650 --> 01:25:53.810
you know in the old tradition now you
know one of the things I'm thinking

01:25:53.810 --> 01:25:53.820
know one of the things I'm thinking
 

01:25:53.820 --> 01:25:55.820
know one of the things I'm thinking
about is there's a lot of collaborations

01:25:55.820 --> 01:25:55.830
about is there's a lot of collaborations
 

01:25:55.830 --> 01:26:00.340
about is there's a lot of collaborations
between universities and companies and

01:26:00.340 --> 01:26:00.350
between universities and companies and
 

01:26:00.350 --> 01:26:03.020
between universities and companies and
obviously there's where you're going to

01:26:03.020 --> 01:26:03.030
obviously there's where you're going to
 

01:26:03.030 --> 01:26:06.220
obviously there's where you're going to
have your real secrecy is there a

01:26:06.220 --> 01:26:06.230
have your real secrecy is there a
 

01:26:06.230 --> 01:26:10.370
have your real secrecy is there a
utopian vision of any changes in that

01:26:10.370 --> 01:26:10.380
utopian vision of any changes in that
 

01:26:10.380 --> 01:26:13.459
utopian vision of any changes in that
that could open that up is that possible

01:26:13.459 --> 01:26:13.469
that could open that up is that possible
 

01:26:13.469 --> 01:26:16.729
that could open that up is that possible
or I mean this is going a bit far afield

01:26:16.729 --> 01:26:16.739
or I mean this is going a bit far afield
 

01:26:16.739 --> 01:26:20.870
or I mean this is going a bit far afield
but you know I'm just curious if you

01:26:20.870 --> 01:26:20.880
but you know I'm just curious if you
 

01:26:20.880 --> 01:26:24.620
but you know I'm just curious if you
guys have any ideas about that yes will

01:26:24.620 --> 01:26:24.630
guys have any ideas about that yes will
 

01:26:24.630 --> 01:26:28.669
guys have any ideas about that yes will
I we are you know if if you read talking

01:26:28.669 --> 01:26:28.679
I we are you know if if you read talking
 

01:26:28.679 --> 01:26:34.959
I we are you know if if you read talking
we are the open access gnaws drool but I

01:26:34.959 --> 01:26:34.969
we are the open access gnaws drool but I
 

01:26:34.969 --> 01:26:37.669
we are the open access gnaws drool but I
have to say something open access

01:26:37.669 --> 01:26:37.679
have to say something open access
 

01:26:37.679 --> 01:26:40.100
have to say something open access
especially open notebook science what

01:26:40.100 --> 01:26:40.110
especially open notebook science what
 

01:26:40.110 --> 01:26:42.709
especially open notebook science what
they're doing is not for everybody there

01:26:42.709 --> 01:26:42.719
they're doing is not for everybody there
 

01:26:42.719 --> 01:26:44.780
they're doing is not for everybody there
are situations where this is not an

01:26:44.780 --> 01:26:44.790
are situations where this is not an
 

01:26:44.790 --> 01:26:46.850
are situations where this is not an
advisable thing and that is for instance

01:26:46.850 --> 01:26:46.860
advisable thing and that is for instance
 

01:26:46.860 --> 01:26:51.050
advisable thing and that is for instance
you know are in the defense things like

01:26:51.050 --> 01:26:51.060
you know are in the defense things like
 

01:26:51.060 --> 01:26:53.419
you know are in the defense things like
that no you want to keep those things

01:26:53.419 --> 01:26:53.429
that no you want to keep those things
 

01:26:53.429 --> 01:26:55.610
that no you want to keep those things
secret i mean its government research

01:26:55.610 --> 01:26:55.620
secret i mean its government research
 

01:26:55.620 --> 01:26:58.189
secret i mean its government research
we're building on your rocket you don't

01:26:58.189 --> 01:26:58.199
we're building on your rocket you don't
 

01:26:58.199 --> 01:27:00.169
we're building on your rocket you don't
do open notebook science on that and

01:27:00.169 --> 01:27:00.179
do open notebook science on that and
 

01:27:00.179 --> 01:27:01.669
do open notebook science on that and
that's fine and they're going to be

01:27:01.669 --> 01:27:01.679
that's fine and they're going to be
 

01:27:01.679 --> 01:27:06.050
that's fine and they're going to be
other kind of in between cases so we're

01:27:06.050 --> 01:27:06.060
other kind of in between cases so we're
 

01:27:06.060 --> 01:27:08.419
other kind of in between cases so we're
trying to push those people who are in

01:27:08.419 --> 01:27:08.429
trying to push those people who are in
 

01:27:08.429 --> 01:27:11.240
trying to push those people who are in
the areas that should profit from doing

01:27:11.240 --> 01:27:11.250
the areas that should profit from doing
 

01:27:11.250 --> 01:27:14.090
the areas that should profit from doing
it openly but we understand i think you

01:27:14.090 --> 01:27:14.100
it openly but we understand i think you
 

01:27:14.100 --> 01:27:16.669
it openly but we understand i think you
agree that there are areas which for

01:27:16.669 --> 01:27:16.679
agree that there are areas which for
 

01:27:16.679 --> 01:27:18.890
agree that there are areas which for
which that is just not the appropriate

01:27:18.890 --> 01:27:18.900
which that is just not the appropriate
 

01:27:18.900 --> 01:27:21.020
which that is just not the appropriate
way to go yeah i mean i would even say

01:27:21.020 --> 01:27:21.030
way to go yeah i mean i would even say
 

01:27:21.030 --> 01:27:23.270
way to go yeah i mean i would even say
that you know i don't foresee mainstream

01:27:23.270 --> 01:27:23.280
that you know i don't foresee mainstream
 

01:27:23.280 --> 01:27:25.729
that you know i don't foresee mainstream
science becoming open notebook I don't

01:27:25.729 --> 01:27:25.739
science becoming open notebook I don't
 

01:27:25.739 --> 01:27:27.410
science becoming open notebook I don't
see that at all but the beauty of it is

01:27:27.410 --> 01:27:27.420
see that at all but the beauty of it is
 

01:27:27.420 --> 01:27:28.939
see that at all but the beauty of it is
is that you'll need a very small

01:27:28.939 --> 01:27:28.949
is that you'll need a very small
 

01:27:28.949 --> 01:27:30.649
is that you'll need a very small
fraction of scientists to actually do it

01:27:30.649 --> 01:27:30.659
fraction of scientists to actually do it
 

01:27:30.659 --> 01:27:33.110
fraction of scientists to actually do it
to gain the benefit and that's really

01:27:33.110 --> 01:27:33.120
to gain the benefit and that's really
 

01:27:33.120 --> 01:27:34.580
to gain the benefit and that's really
what we're shooting for is to not

01:27:34.580 --> 01:27:34.590
what we're shooting for is to not
 

01:27:34.590 --> 01:27:36.260
what we're shooting for is to not
necessarily convert people but to find

01:27:36.260 --> 01:27:36.270
necessarily convert people but to find
 

01:27:36.270 --> 01:27:39.439
necessarily convert people but to find
people who recognize that eight you know

01:27:39.439 --> 01:27:39.449
people who recognize that eight you know
 

01:27:39.449 --> 01:27:41.209
people who recognize that eight you know
I'd like to do this but I don't have

01:27:41.209 --> 01:27:41.219
I'd like to do this but I don't have
 

01:27:41.219 --> 01:27:43.250
I'd like to do this but I don't have
time to figure out how so show me how

01:27:43.250 --> 01:27:43.260
time to figure out how so show me how
 

01:27:43.260 --> 01:27:45.229
time to figure out how so show me how
and then we have the how now it's just a

01:27:45.229 --> 01:27:45.239
and then we have the how now it's just a
 

01:27:45.239 --> 01:27:47.600
and then we have the how now it's just a
question of doing it see the nice thing

01:27:47.600 --> 01:27:47.610
question of doing it see the nice thing
 

01:27:47.610 --> 01:27:48.830
question of doing it see the nice thing
that happens especially with open

01:27:48.830 --> 01:27:48.840
that happens especially with open
 

01:27:48.840 --> 01:27:50.300
that happens especially with open
notebook science is that the day that

01:27:50.300 --> 01:27:50.310
notebook science is that the day that
 

01:27:50.310 --> 01:27:52.520
notebook science is that the day that
the experiment gets done everyone knows

01:27:52.520 --> 01:27:52.530
the experiment gets done everyone knows
 

01:27:52.530 --> 01:27:54.770
the experiment gets done everyone knows
about it so a stranger could come and

01:27:54.770 --> 01:27:54.780
about it so a stranger could come and
 

01:27:54.780 --> 01:27:57.260
about it so a stranger could come and
pick up your project that very same day

01:27:57.260 --> 01:27:57.270
pick up your project that very same day
 

01:27:57.270 --> 01:27:59.510
pick up your project that very same day
and that's really why I keep making such

01:27:59.510 --> 01:27:59.520
and that's really why I keep making such
 

01:27:59.520 --> 01:27:59.729
and that's really why I keep making such
a

01:27:59.729 --> 01:27:59.739
a
 

01:27:59.739 --> 01:28:01.649
a
emphasis on this concept because if you

01:28:01.649 --> 01:28:01.659
emphasis on this concept because if you
 

01:28:01.659 --> 01:28:03.509
emphasis on this concept because if you
if you delayed your notebook by six

01:28:03.509 --> 01:28:03.519
if you delayed your notebook by six
 

01:28:03.519 --> 01:28:06.209
if you delayed your notebook by six
months you lose pretty much most of the

01:28:06.209 --> 01:28:06.219
months you lose pretty much most of the
 

01:28:06.219 --> 01:28:08.399
months you lose pretty much most of the
advantage it's at that point when I

01:28:08.399 --> 01:28:08.409
advantage it's at that point when I
 

01:28:08.409 --> 01:28:09.419
advantage it's at that point when I
think we're going to start to see

01:28:09.419 --> 01:28:09.429
think we're going to start to see
 

01:28:09.429 --> 01:28:11.549
think we're going to start to see
machines collaborating with machines on

01:28:11.549 --> 01:28:11.559
machines collaborating with machines on
 

01:28:11.559 --> 01:28:14.399
machines collaborating with machines on
a very very rapid basis if you can read

01:28:14.399 --> 01:28:14.409
a very very rapid basis if you can read
 

01:28:14.409 --> 01:28:17.189
a very very rapid basis if you can read
and write for free on a platform then

01:28:17.189 --> 01:28:17.199
and write for free on a platform then
 

01:28:17.199 --> 01:28:18.299
and write for free on a platform then
you can start to think about these

01:28:18.299 --> 01:28:18.309
you can start to think about these
 

01:28:18.309 --> 01:28:20.459
you can start to think about these
things but no you absolutely need to

01:28:20.459 --> 01:28:20.469
things but no you absolutely need to
 

01:28:20.469 --> 01:28:22.919
things but no you absolutely need to
have mainstream science become that in

01:28:22.919 --> 01:28:22.929
have mainstream science become that in
 

01:28:22.929 --> 01:28:25.169
have mainstream science become that in
people who have their livelihood

01:28:25.169 --> 01:28:25.179
people who have their livelihood
 

01:28:25.179 --> 01:28:27.450
people who have their livelihood
dependent on patents obviously can't do

01:28:27.450 --> 01:28:27.460
dependent on patents obviously can't do
 

01:28:27.460 --> 01:28:30.810
dependent on patents obviously can't do
that at all that's fine yeah yeah I mean

01:28:30.810 --> 01:28:30.820
that at all that's fine yeah yeah I mean
 

01:28:30.820 --> 01:28:32.850
that at all that's fine yeah yeah I mean
I'm my experience I've transitioned from

01:28:32.850 --> 01:28:32.860
I'm my experience I've transitioned from
 

01:28:32.860 --> 01:28:34.979
I'm my experience I've transitioned from
an academic community that you know kind

01:28:34.979 --> 01:28:34.989
an academic community that you know kind
 

01:28:34.989 --> 01:28:37.859
an academic community that you know kind
of viscerally supported like open access

01:28:37.859 --> 01:28:37.869
of viscerally supported like open access
 

01:28:37.869 --> 01:28:39.359
of viscerally supported like open access
to information and now I'm working at a

01:28:39.359 --> 01:28:39.369
to information and now I'm working at a
 

01:28:39.369 --> 01:28:41.459
to information and now I'm working at a
company and we've had to accept the fact

01:28:41.459 --> 01:28:41.469
company and we've had to accept the fact
 

01:28:41.469 --> 01:28:42.720
company and we've had to accept the fact
that that if we're going to stay in

01:28:42.720 --> 01:28:42.730
that that if we're going to stay in
 

01:28:42.730 --> 01:28:43.799
that that if we're going to stay in
business and make money than there are

01:28:43.799 --> 01:28:43.809
business and make money than there are
 

01:28:43.809 --> 01:28:45.959
business and make money than there are
things that we have to keep key

01:28:45.959 --> 01:28:45.969
things that we have to keep key
 

01:28:45.969 --> 01:28:47.910
things that we have to keep key
proprietary and keep to ourselves so I

01:28:47.910 --> 01:28:47.920
proprietary and keep to ourselves so I
 

01:28:47.920 --> 01:28:49.560
proprietary and keep to ourselves so I
think yeah it's just different solutions

01:28:49.560 --> 01:28:49.570
think yeah it's just different solutions
 

01:28:49.570 --> 01:28:52.140
think yeah it's just different solutions
were different for different groups even

01:28:52.140 --> 01:28:52.150
were different for different groups even
 

01:28:52.150 --> 01:28:57.089
were different for different groups even
within science or if it changes it's not

01:28:57.089 --> 01:28:57.099
within science or if it changes it's not
 

01:28:57.099 --> 01:28:58.709
within science or if it changes it's not
going to be very soon it's going to be

01:28:58.709 --> 01:28:58.719
going to be very soon it's going to be
 

01:28:58.719 --> 01:29:01.649
going to be very soon it's going to be
50 or 100 years science fiction kind of

01:29:01.649 --> 01:29:01.659
50 or 100 years science fiction kind of
 

01:29:01.659 --> 01:29:05.759
50 or 100 years science fiction kind of
it with technological changes you might

01:29:05.759 --> 01:29:05.769
it with technological changes you might
 

01:29:05.769 --> 01:29:07.589
it with technological changes you might
get to the point where it's fine for

01:29:07.589 --> 01:29:07.599
get to the point where it's fine for
 

01:29:07.599 --> 01:29:10.560
get to the point where it's fine for
government to build new weapon and do it

01:29:10.560 --> 01:29:10.570
government to build new weapon and do it
 

01:29:10.570 --> 01:29:12.569
government to build new weapon and do it
openly and nobody can do anything about

01:29:12.569 --> 01:29:12.579
openly and nobody can do anything about
 

01:29:12.579 --> 01:29:14.640
openly and nobody can do anything about
it because there's still the fastest

01:29:14.640 --> 01:29:14.650
it because there's still the fastest
 

01:29:14.650 --> 01:29:18.120
it because there's still the fastest
they started first well obviously there

01:29:18.120 --> 01:29:18.130
they started first well obviously there
 

01:29:18.130 --> 01:29:19.950
they started first well obviously there
there are issues of national security

01:29:19.950 --> 01:29:19.960
there are issues of national security
 

01:29:19.960 --> 01:29:21.930
there are issues of national security
and things like that where you

01:29:21.930 --> 01:29:21.940
and things like that where you
 

01:29:21.940 --> 01:29:24.629
and things like that where you
absolutely you know secrecy isn't even a

01:29:24.629 --> 01:29:24.639
absolutely you know secrecy isn't even a
 

01:29:24.639 --> 01:29:27.239
absolutely you know secrecy isn't even a
question but something like the

01:29:27.239 --> 01:29:27.249
question but something like the
 

01:29:27.249 --> 01:29:29.640
question but something like the
pharmaceutical companies which fall into

01:29:29.640 --> 01:29:29.650
pharmaceutical companies which fall into
 

01:29:29.650 --> 01:29:31.649
pharmaceutical companies which fall into
the ethical gray area because if you're

01:29:31.649 --> 01:29:31.659
the ethical gray area because if you're
 

01:29:31.659 --> 01:29:34.669
the ethical gray area because if you're
trying to develop a drug for malaria

01:29:34.669 --> 01:29:34.679
trying to develop a drug for malaria
 

01:29:34.679 --> 01:29:38.370
trying to develop a drug for malaria
obviously for the good of the millions

01:29:38.370 --> 01:29:38.380
obviously for the good of the millions
 

01:29:38.380 --> 01:29:39.600
obviously for the good of the millions
and millions of people who are dying

01:29:39.600 --> 01:29:39.610
and millions of people who are dying
 

01:29:39.610 --> 01:29:42.779
and millions of people who are dying
from it it pays to collaborate it would

01:29:42.779 --> 01:29:42.789
from it it pays to collaborate it would
 

01:29:42.789 --> 01:29:45.239
from it it pays to collaborate it would
be wonderful to have everything out in

01:29:45.239 --> 01:29:45.249
be wonderful to have everything out in
 

01:29:45.249 --> 01:29:48.299
be wonderful to have everything out in
the open yeah um and this is a huge

01:29:48.299 --> 01:29:48.309
the open yeah um and this is a huge
 

01:29:48.309 --> 01:29:50.759
the open yeah um and this is a huge
debate within the pharmaceutical you

01:29:50.759 --> 01:29:50.769
debate within the pharmaceutical you
 

01:29:50.769 --> 01:29:54.520
debate within the pharmaceutical you
know science area

01:29:54.520 --> 01:29:54.530
know science area
 

01:29:54.530 --> 01:29:57.370
know science area
and my question was more towards those

01:29:57.370 --> 01:29:57.380
and my question was more towards those
 

01:29:57.380 --> 01:29:59.370
and my question was more towards those
gray areas rather than you know the

01:29:59.370 --> 01:29:59.380
gray areas rather than you know the
 

01:29:59.380 --> 01:30:02.529
gray areas rather than you know the
obvious areas where you know national

01:30:02.529 --> 01:30:02.539
obvious areas where you know national
 

01:30:02.539 --> 01:30:05.589
obvious areas where you know national
security would be compromised so you're

01:30:05.589 --> 01:30:05.599
security would be compromised so you're
 

01:30:05.599 --> 01:30:06.970
security would be compromised so you're
you're by the sign of you're probably

01:30:06.970 --> 01:30:06.980
you're by the sign of you're probably
 

01:30:06.980 --> 01:30:08.919
you're by the sign of you're probably
familiar with some of the things the

01:30:08.919 --> 01:30:08.929
familiar with some of the things the
 

01:30:08.929 --> 01:30:10.390
familiar with some of the things the
pharmaceutical industry has been doing

01:30:10.390 --> 01:30:10.400
pharmaceutical industry has been doing
 

01:30:10.400 --> 01:30:12.609
pharmaceutical industry has been doing
where they've been declaring certain

01:30:12.609 --> 01:30:12.619
where they've been declaring certain
 

01:30:12.619 --> 01:30:13.689
where they've been declaring certain
pieces of information to be

01:30:13.689 --> 01:30:13.699
pieces of information to be
 

01:30:13.699 --> 01:30:15.640
pieces of information to be
pre-competitive and they prefer to just

01:30:15.640 --> 01:30:15.650
pre-competitive and they prefer to just
 

01:30:15.650 --> 01:30:18.129
pre-competitive and they prefer to just
have them out and open and share it

01:30:18.129 --> 01:30:18.139
have them out and open and share it
 

01:30:18.139 --> 01:30:19.930
have them out and open and share it
between everybody I think it was the

01:30:19.930 --> 01:30:19.940
between everybody I think it was the
 

01:30:19.940 --> 01:30:22.120
between everybody I think it was the
library of sniff data that the sum of

01:30:22.120 --> 01:30:22.130
library of sniff data that the sum of
 

01:30:22.130 --> 01:30:23.709
library of sniff data that the sum of
the big companies decide what we should

01:30:23.709 --> 01:30:23.719
the big companies decide what we should
 

01:30:23.719 --> 01:30:25.720
the big companies decide what we should
just share this with everyone so you do

01:30:25.720 --> 01:30:25.730
just share this with everyone so you do
 

01:30:25.730 --> 01:30:28.060
just share this with everyone so you do
see some examples of that I think and I

01:30:28.060 --> 01:30:28.070
see some examples of that I think and I
 

01:30:28.070 --> 01:30:29.709
see some examples of that I think and I
think solubility falls in that area too

01:30:29.709 --> 01:30:29.719
think solubility falls in that area too
 

01:30:29.719 --> 01:30:31.660
think solubility falls in that area too
that's something that all companies get

01:30:31.660 --> 01:30:31.670
that's something that all companies get
 

01:30:31.670 --> 01:30:33.729
that's something that all companies get
benefit from and it's so general that

01:30:33.729 --> 01:30:33.739
benefit from and it's so general that
 

01:30:33.739 --> 01:30:35.229
benefit from and it's so general that
they couldn't really gain any

01:30:35.229 --> 01:30:35.239
they couldn't really gain any
 

01:30:35.239 --> 01:30:38.109
they couldn't really gain any
competitive advantage so yeah and you

01:30:38.109 --> 01:30:38.119
competitive advantage so yeah and you
 

01:30:38.119 --> 01:30:39.160
competitive advantage so yeah and you
know there was some discussion of this

01:30:39.160 --> 01:30:39.170
know there was some discussion of this
 

01:30:39.170 --> 01:30:41.200
know there was some discussion of this
at cyclic shear it becomes a couple

01:30:41.200 --> 01:30:41.210
at cyclic shear it becomes a couple
 

01:30:41.210 --> 01:30:43.029
at cyclic shear it becomes a couple
sessions where the you know there

01:30:43.029 --> 01:30:43.039

because each each company is spending

01:30:44.709 --> 01:30:44.719
because each each company is spending
 

01:30:44.719 --> 01:30:46.240
because each each company is spending
all this money doing the same thing and

01:30:46.240 --> 01:30:46.250
all this money doing the same thing and
 

01:30:46.250 --> 01:31:11.260
all this money doing the same thing and
it's not necessarily competitive so yeah

01:31:11.260 --> 01:31:11.270
 

01:31:11.270 --> 01:31:13.630
probably not but I drove it probably not

level concept yeah but I'm assuming

01:31:27.040 --> 01:31:27.050
level concept yeah but I'm assuming
 

01:31:27.050 --> 01:31:29.050

they're pretty good at reverse

01:31:29.050 --> 01:31:29.060

they work so they can build something

01:31:34.570 --> 01:31:34.580
they work so they can build something
 

01:31:34.580 --> 01:31:52.410
they work so they can build something
better maybe I hope

aren't aren't secret and the amount you
 

01:32:16.429 --> 01:32:18.609

it but what you're talking about which
is you know ensuring norms and formats

01:34:27.890 --> 01:34:27.900
is you know ensuring norms and formats

and things like that you can use things
 

01:34:30.120 --> 01:34:31.940
and things like that you can use things
like that if you know you don't have

like that if you know you don't have
 

01:34:31.950 --> 01:34:35.300

will come in they'll delete a cell
because they don't know what they're

01:34:47.360 --> 01:34:47.370
because they don't know what they're
 

01:34:47.370 --> 01:34:49.459
