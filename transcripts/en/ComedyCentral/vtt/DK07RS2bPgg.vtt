&gt;&gt; I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

00:00:02.501 --> 00:00:05.304 align:start position:0% line:91%
WHY DO PEOPLE WANT TO HELP
PRISONERS, LIKE PEOPLE WHO ARE

00:00:05.337 --> 00:00:06.071 align:start position:0% line:85%
IN THERE?

00:00:06.105 --> 00:00:07.640 align:start position:0% line:91%
WHAT DO YOU THINK THAT'S ALL
ABOUT?

00:00:07.673 --> 00:00:10.243 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; HAVE YOU SEEN THE PICTURE OF
THIS WOMAN?

00:00:10.276 --> 00:00:11.244 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; NO.

00:00:11.277 --> 00:00:13.746 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; I THINK SHE GOT TURNED OUT BY
THESE BAD BOYS.

00:00:13.779 --> 00:00:15.314 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; DO YOU THINK SO?

00:00:15.347 --> 00:00:18.184 line:85%
&gt;&gt; YEAH, I DEFINITELY THINK SO.

00:00:18.217 --> 00:00:20.453 align:start position:0% line:91%
AND APPARENTLY THIS GUY IS
PACKING SOME JUNK.

00:00:20.486 --> 00:00:22.455 size:75% position:38% line:85%
HE HAS PRISON GAME, TOO.

00:00:22.488 --> 00:00:27.160 align:start position:0% line:91%
HE'S PROBABLY WHISPERING SWEET
NOTHINGS IN HER EAR.

00:00:27.193 --> 00:00:30.329 align:start position:0% line:91%
ALL YOU GOT TO DO IS WORK ON
YOUR BODY IN PRISON.

00:00:30.362 --> 00:00:34.500 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; IF THAT'S THE CASE, THE JUNK
IS LEAVING.

00:00:34.533 --> 00:00:38.671 line:91%
&gt;&gt; MAYBE HE PROMISED SHE WOULD
BE ALONG FOR THE RIDE, AND HE

00:00:38.704 --> 00:00:39.271 align:start position:0% line:85%
LEFT HER.

00:00:39.305 --> 00:00:43.810 size:81% position:41% line:85%
YOU KNOW HOW YOU GUYS ARE.

00:00:43.843 --> 00:00:49.549 line:91%

IT, LIKE, HE'S 6'0" TALL, WHITE,

00:00:49.582 --> 00:00:51.384 align:start position:0% line:85%
HAS A BIG [BLEEP].

00:00:51.417 --> 00:00:53.152 align:start position:0% line:85%
WHY IS THAT A THING?

00:00:53.185 --> 00:00:54.320 size:81% position:41% line:85%
WAS THERE A SKETCH ARTIST?

00:00:54.353 --> 00:00:58.691 align:start position:0% line:91%
WAS I GOING TO FIND HIM IN
SWEATPANTS, AND BE, LIKE, I SEE

HIM, HE'S RUNNING THROUGH MY
NEIGHBORHOOD RIGHT NOW.

00:01:01.293 --> 00:01:02.662 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; MAYBE THERE WERE NO POWER
TOOLS.

00:01:02.695 --> 00:01:04.931 line:85%
MAYBE IT WAS JUST HIS [BLEEP].

00:01:04.964 --> 00:01:07.467 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; OH, WOW!

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:08.635 align:start position:0% line:85%
YES.

00:01:08.668 --> 00:01:11.504 line:91%
THAT'S WHAT TIM ROBINS USED IN
"SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION," TOO.

00:01:11.537 --> 00:01:18.945 line:91%
&gt;&gt; TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION ABOUT
WHY WE'RE FASCINATED WITH THEM,

00:01:18.978 --> 00:01:21.447 size:81% position:41% line:91%
THE AMERICAN CRIMINAL IS

JAIL  ARE COMING OUT
ONE DAY.

00:01:38.597 --> 00:01:39.966 align:start position:0% line:91%

FUTURE NEIGHBORS.

00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:41.200 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; WHERE DO YOU LIVE?

00:01:41.233 --> 00:01:43.236 align:start position:0% line:85%

CRIMINALS.

00:01:46.972 --> 00:01:49.442 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; ALLEGED CRIMINALS.

00:01:49.475 --> 00:01:50.343 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; WAIT.

00:01:50.376 --> 00:01:51.911 align:start position:0% line:91%
YOU THINK MOST OF THEM SHOULDN'T
BE THERE?

00:01:51.944 --> 00:01:55.648 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; I FEEL LIKE A LOT OF
PEOPLE -- THIS IS CRAZY.

00:01:55.681 --> 00:01:59.585 align:start position:0% line:91%
ONE IN EVERY HUNDRED AMERICANS

00:02:02.021 --> 00:02:04.457 line:91%
&gt;&gt; I DON'T FEEL BAD FOR THESE
GUYS RIGHT NOW THAT ARE OUT.

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:06.459 align:start position:0% line:91%
THEY'RE HAVING THE BEST WEEK OF
THEIR LIVES.

00:02:06.492 --> 00:02:09.662 size:84% position:42% line:91%
THEY GOT OUT OF JAIL AND ON

00:02:09.695 --> 00:02:13.432 line:85%
BIGGEST [BLEEP]  OF ALL TIME.

00:02:13.465 --> 00:02:14.666 size:81% position:41% line:85%
I CAN'T FEEL BAD FOR THEM.

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.437 line:91%
&gt;&gt; AS A CULTURE, WE ROMANTICIZE
THE NOTION OF THE CRIMINAL AND

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:19.571 align:start position:0% line:85%
OUTLAW.

00:02:19.605 --> 00:02:23.342 align:start position:0% line:91%
EVEN OUR HIT SHOWS, TONY
SOPRANO, TONY MONTANA, DEXTER IS

SHE WENT FOR HIM.

00:02:43.395 --> 00:02:46.499 align:start size:91% position:9% line:91%
THE FUNNY THING IS THE BIG
[BLEEP], WHATEVER.

00:02:46.532 --> 00:02:49.402 align:start position:0% line:91%
SERIOUSLY, WHAT IS IT ABOUT
WOMEN AND BAD BOYS?

00:02:49.435 --> 00:02:51.938 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; THEY'RE INCREDIBLY
CHARISMATIC.

00:02:51.971 --> 00:02:54.607 align:start position:0% line:91%
YOU LIKE THE IDEA OF BEING ABLE
TO FLOUT, MAYBE REPRESS --

00:02:54.640 --> 00:03:00.046 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; REMEMBER THAT GIRL WHO ALMOST
MARRIED CHARLES MANSON?

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:03.049 line:91%
AND HE EVEN SAID THIS
IS A LITTLE CRAZY.

00:03:03.082 --> 00:03:04.517 align:start position:0% line:85%
HE BROKE IT UP, RIGHT?

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:05.618 size:75% position:38% line:85%
&gt;&gt; HE KNEW IT WAS CRAZY.

00:03:05.651 --> 00:03:08.287 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; IT'S A CONTROLLING
RELATIONSHIP.

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:09.822 align:start position:0% line:91%
SHE WANTS TO KNOW WHERE YOU'RE
AT ALL TIMES.

00:03:09.855 --> 00:03:12.325 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; THAT'S HILARIOUS.

CHARLES MANSON'S FIANCEE BROKE

00:03:25.437 --> 00:03:26.071 align:start position:0% line:85%
UP WITH HIM.

00:03:26.105 --> 00:03:26.772 line:85%
I'M GUESSING SHE GOOGLED HIM.

00:03:26.805 --> 00:03:27.373 line:85%
OH, YOU'RE THAT CHARLES MANSON.

00:03:27.406 --> 00:03:29.072 size:78% position:39% line:85%
