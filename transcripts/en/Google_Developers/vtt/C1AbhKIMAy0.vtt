00:00:00.827 --> 00:00:02.535
MALE SPEAKER: So let
me switch to English

00:00:02.535 --> 00:00:06.393
because Bridgette will
be speaking in English.

00:00:06.393 --> 00:00:09.540
Bridgette represents
Google for Entrepreneurs,

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.880
so she'll tell you a
few words about that.

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.490
And she wants to share
her ideas on what

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:18.372
data means for entrepreneurs.

00:00:18.372 --> 00:00:21.155
So please, Bridgette,
come onstage.

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.260
BRIDGETTE BEAM: Now, hello.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:28.840
I'm Bridgette, Bridgette Beam.

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:31.370
I work on this team,
Google for Entrepreneurs.

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:35.346
I'm based out of Google's
headquarters in California.

00:00:35.346 --> 00:00:38.400
A little bit about my
team before I get started.

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:42.280
I don't want to bore you too
long, but it's a great team.

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.760
We basically focus on how Google
can foster entrepreneurship

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:46.950
around the world.

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.030
How we can get you the
resources, the programs,

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:54.130
the partners, the opportunities
you need to be successful.

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:57.060
This is our website-- if
you ever have a chance,

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:59.270
it's actually super useful.

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:03.920
We put on these classes
online which are free.

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:05.350
These are normally paid classes.

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:07.680
A lot of them are
taught by Googlers,

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.270
and product managers, marketers.

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:14.090
Also, many of them are taught
by experts outside of Google.

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:16.660
We release one every
week, pretty much.

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:19.830
So if you follow us on Google+,
we put up new content all

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.270
the time.

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:22.445
We also have great events.

00:01:22.445 --> 00:01:23.820
So if you ever
have a chance, you

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.880
can check out some of the
events like this that are here.

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.720
Again, we also post
those to Google+.

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:31.700
So if you guys are
interested, it's really about

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.560
bringing Googlers
and our talent to you

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.970
to help you be successful, and
that's what today is about.

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:40.540
So please, if you have
questions, ask them.

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:45.220
All the Googlers in the room,
can you please raise your hand?

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:46.020
See, there's a lot.

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.590
The ratio's quite high, beware.

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:49.554
Just kidding.

00:01:49.554 --> 00:01:51.750
But there are a lot of
people here to help you,

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.550
so please ask questions.

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:56.697
First of all, who is willing
to volunteer and tell me

00:01:56.697 --> 00:01:58.650
why you're here?

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:01.501
Or give me your pitch--
what does your company do?

00:02:01.501 --> 00:02:02.000
Yeah?

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.706
OK, here we go.

00:02:04.706 --> 00:02:06.100
RAPHAEL: Hi, everybody.

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:07.980
I'm Raphael from
[INAUDIBLE] Show,

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:10.340
and I'm here to learn
a lot from Googlers.

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.170
And first of all, I
have one question--

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:13.650
why does Google exist?

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.027
BRIDGETTE BEAM: Why does it?

00:02:15.027 --> 00:02:15.610
RAPHAEL: Yeah.

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:18.060
BRIDGETTE BEAM: What
does your company do?

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:23.830
RAPHAEL: My company,
we're making [INAUDIBLE].

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:28.050
So it's like a way to take
notes more intelligently.

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:29.485
Thank you.

00:02:29.485 --> 00:02:31.110
BRIDGETTE BEAM: All
right, the question

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:32.270
was why Google does this.

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:33.145
It's a good question.

00:02:33.145 --> 00:02:35.725
So if you think about
Google as a search engine,

00:02:35.725 --> 00:02:37.650
we need really great
content out there

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.585
to make the web really
valuable, right?

00:02:39.585 --> 00:02:41.540
If you search and
there's nothing there,

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:43.290
or if you're trying
to find an application

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:46.190
and there's nothing there for
you, it's not very useful.

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:48.595
Google is very much a
platform for other people

00:02:48.595 --> 00:02:50.546
to succeed as much
as we succeed.

00:02:50.546 --> 00:02:52.616
We only succeed if
entrepreneurs do,

00:02:52.616 --> 00:02:54.220
so that's why this
program exists.

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:55.103
Does that make sense?

00:02:55.103 --> 00:02:55.536
RAPHAEL: Yeah.

00:02:55.536 --> 00:02:55.970
BRIDGETTE BEAM: Cool.

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:57.620
Anybody else want to volunteer?

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:59.883
I promise I'll talk about
something else in a minute,

00:02:59.883 --> 00:03:03.447
but I want some examples
for my presentation.

00:03:03.447 --> 00:03:04.280
Oh, way in the back.

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:05.000
Can you yell?

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.710
TERRY: Yeah.

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:06.902
BRIDGETTE BEAM: All right.

00:03:06.902 --> 00:03:07.735
TERRY: Hi, everyone.

00:03:07.735 --> 00:03:11.760
My name is Terry, and I am
doing a little recipe platform.

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.106
Do you cook? [INAUDIBLE]?

00:03:13.106 --> 00:03:14.230
BRIDGETTE BEAM: Yes, a lot.

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:18.000
TERRY: So, you can [INAUDIBLE]
with us with your recipes.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.980
So we buy recipes.

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:21.145
We give you $20.

00:03:21.145 --> 00:03:22.650
BRIDGETTE BEAM: He
buys my recipes.

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:23.470
TERRY: Yes, I do.

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:24.303
BRIDGETTE BEAM: $20.

00:03:24.303 --> 00:03:26.005
TERRY: So I would
like Google to help

00:03:26.005 --> 00:03:28.056
me to make with
Google checkout, and I

00:03:28.056 --> 00:03:30.712
would like you to feature
my application with Android

00:03:30.712 --> 00:03:32.158
at top.

00:03:32.158 --> 00:03:34.570
BRIDGETTE BEAM: OK, is there
a Googler here with Android.

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:36.896
TERRY: I want also to have
a good reference on Google+.

00:03:36.896 --> 00:03:37.884
[INAUDIBLE].

00:03:37.884 --> 00:03:39.366
Because we need to bring people.

00:03:39.366 --> 00:03:41.150
We are going global
so we need your help.

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:43.172
BRIDGETTE BEAM: This guy's going
to be super busy today, running

00:03:43.172 --> 00:03:44.232
around to everyone.

00:03:44.232 --> 00:03:46.150
OK, sounds good.

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:49.085
Well, what I want
to talk about today,

00:03:49.085 --> 00:03:50.870
I am an entrepreneur myself.

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:53.600
I work with two entrepreneurs
very intimately-- one

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:57.540
is my husband, and
one is my mother.

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:59.390
My family has a
ton of businesses.

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:01.430
Everybody is running
around making things,

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:03.165
helping people, doing stuff.

00:04:03.165 --> 00:04:07.670
So I on a daily basis actually
help monitor Google+ pages,

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:10.775
AdWords, Analytics,
all of the above.

00:04:10.775 --> 00:04:13.514
And so today I actually want to
share with you some of my-- I

00:04:13.514 --> 00:04:15.055
don't have very much
time to do this.

00:04:15.055 --> 00:04:16.370
I have a full-time job.

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:18.680
It's probably more like
two full-time jobs,

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:20.926
and then this is something
I do on the side.

00:04:20.926 --> 00:04:23.790
You're also very, very
busy people, right?

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:25.960
And you need to know
what kind of decisions

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:27.252
to make on a daily basis.

00:04:27.252 --> 00:04:29.710
So I'm actually just going to
share a little bit about what

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:33.180
I do every day with my family's
businesses to help them.

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:37.100
And I think it's really valuable
for you as an entrepreneur.

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:39.320
So I want to talk about data.

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:40.620
It's a very hot topic.

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:43.300
Everybody loves to talk
about data and infographics.

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:45.780
But very, very few
of the time did

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:48.050
they find data being useful.

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:50.570
So I'm going to talk
about a few courses first.

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:53.360
Everybody likes numbers, so I'll
share some cool Google numbers

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:54.360
with you.

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:57.100
But essentially, we all
know the world has changed.

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:59.780
There's a blog out there
called Failed Dinners.

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:01.495
Have you guys seen this?

00:05:01.495 --> 00:05:05.150
It's basically a bunch of
people, or people on a date,

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:06.880
who go out to dinner
together and they

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:08.559
spend the whole
time on their phone.

00:05:08.559 --> 00:05:10.350
People take pictures
of them, and then they

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:11.340
send it to this blog.

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:15.675
It's actually hilarious--
it's very sad, but hilarious.

00:05:15.675 --> 00:05:17.840
So some of the reasons
that things have changed

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:19.680
are really because
of these two forces.

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:21.700
One force is
information, so we have

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:23.600
this explosion in information.

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:26.740
You have the ability to
have access to as much data

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:29.080
as you want, right?

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:32.510
If you don't have Analytics,
if you don't look for data sets

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:35.050
around your
industry, you should.

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:37.345
So this is really overwhelming.

00:05:37.345 --> 00:05:39.260
If you want to look
at 30 trillion URLs,

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:42.380
I don't even know what trillion
looks like-- never tried.

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:46.780
You want to give me $30
trillion, I'm OK with that.

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:49.730
And then the other force is
really increase in access.

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:52.440
So if you look at these
numbers, think of all the people

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:55.750
who are getting online who
did not get online before.

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:59.225
1.5 million Android
activations per day.

00:05:59.225 --> 00:06:01.545
That's a lot more
people coming online

00:06:01.545 --> 00:06:02.720
that weren't online before.

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:03.720
These are new customers.

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:05.690
These are different
types of customers.

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:10.550
These are customers accessing
your application, your website,

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:13.020
your business through
multiple devices.

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:14.570
This is a new
segment of the market

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:17.854
that did not exist
that long ago.

00:06:17.854 --> 00:06:21.500
How many people remember
life before cell phones?

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:23.271
We had one of
those in a suitcase

00:06:23.271 --> 00:06:26.220
in the car when I was
younger for emergencies.

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:28.840
I think it cost
like $40 a minute.

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:30.785
And it was never
charged, it never worked.

00:06:30.785 --> 00:06:35.380
I don't think we used it,
but it was really cool.

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:37.100
2 billion internet
searches globally.

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:39.510
And this is actually another
stat that's not up here,

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:43.170
is 15% of searches every
single day are new.

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:46.390
So 15% of the searches that
Google sees on a daily basis

00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:48.620
have never been searched
before-- that's actually

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:49.360
very interesting.

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:52.380
You think of search as kind of a
stagnant thing-- people looking

00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:54.860
up recipes, people
looking up information

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:57.602
on a very flat level,
but a lot of these

00:06:57.602 --> 00:06:58.560
are brand new searches.

00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:05.790
So with all this information,
how do we make use of it?

00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:08.110
So information is as
powerful, essentially,

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:09.244
as your ability to use it.

00:07:09.244 --> 00:07:11.202
So that's what we're
going to talk about today,

00:07:11.202 --> 00:07:12.950
is how do you use your data?

00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:15.310
And we're even going to
have Vince Surf tell us,

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:16.670
how do you use your data?

00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:19.830
He's like godfather,
grandfather of the internet.

00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:22.025
He's very nice if you ever
get a chance to meet him.

00:07:22.025 --> 00:07:26.220
He's like really cozy,
grandfather-like.

00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:29.860
So we're going to
talk two segments.

00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:31.490
First is the macro data.

00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:34.320
I come from an economics
and math background.

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:36.685
And I love to talk
about economics.

00:07:36.685 --> 00:07:39.355
So if you guys want to talk
about that later, I'm happy to.

00:07:39.355 --> 00:07:43.640
But macro data, this is all
the forces in the world-- all

00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:47.990
of the industry forces, all
of the demographic forces,

00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:49.710
the financial forces
that are having

00:07:49.710 --> 00:07:51.699
an impact on your business.

00:07:51.699 --> 00:07:53.740
So first of all I'm going
to show you some tools.

00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:55.573
It's up to you to figure
out how to use them

00:07:55.573 --> 00:07:58.650
for your own business.

00:07:58.650 --> 00:08:00.200
I used to do this,
I'll do it again.

00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:02.700
I'll give you guys one euro
if you do not learn something

00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:04.200
during this
presentation, all right?

00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:05.920
This is my challenge.

00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:07.730
I think I only have
three euros on me,

00:08:07.730 --> 00:08:10.650
so I really have to do well.

00:08:10.650 --> 00:08:15.154
How many of you guys have heard
of Google Public Data Explorer?

00:08:15.154 --> 00:08:15.654
Yes.

00:08:15.654 --> 00:08:17.720
I'm doing pretty good already.

00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:19.050
So this is a tool.

00:08:19.050 --> 00:08:20.960
Basically what it is
is government data,

00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:23.990
and data that's publicly
available to the world

00:08:23.990 --> 00:08:26.140
but has never been put
in a usable format.

00:08:26.140 --> 00:08:27.660
So this is data from the UN.

00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:31.430
This is data from the US
government from the eurozone.

00:08:31.430 --> 00:08:33.390
So I'm going to go here.

00:08:33.390 --> 00:08:36.760
You can just find us at
Google Public Data Explorer.

00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:40.890
So I'll show you their
example here on the site.

00:08:40.890 --> 00:08:43.720
So this is actually just
showing from the world

00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:47.090
economic indicators life
expectancy via country

00:08:47.090 --> 00:08:47.725
and over time.

00:08:47.725 --> 00:08:49.400
This is pretty cool.

00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:53.131
How many of you guys have heard
of Google-- there's a map tool.

00:08:53.131 --> 00:08:54.380
I can't think of the map tool.

00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:57.480
These are basically
open, public data sets.

00:08:57.480 --> 00:08:59.276
This tool you can actually use.

00:08:59.276 --> 00:09:01.110
You can actually
ingest your own data

00:09:01.110 --> 00:09:02.700
and use these graphical tools.

00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:06.110
I'll show you them really
quickly here-- very cool.

00:09:06.110 --> 00:09:10.450
This is one on the world, and
this is the one across town.

00:09:10.450 --> 00:09:15.530
So if you want to explore data
sets-- and think about this.

00:09:15.530 --> 00:09:18.300
Let's imagine that the
country, or the state,

00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:20.220
or the region that
you do the best in has

00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:22.275
a particular
broadband penetration,

00:09:22.275 --> 00:09:25.530
has a particular level
of Android devices,

00:09:25.530 --> 00:09:30.352
or iOS devices, has a particular
amount of disposable income.

00:09:30.352 --> 00:09:32.810
These are factors like, let's
say a country that you choose

00:09:32.810 --> 00:09:35.525
to enter, or a country
you choose to focus on,

00:09:35.525 --> 00:09:36.775
you want it to look like what?

00:09:36.775 --> 00:09:38.650
How could you find other
countries like that?

00:09:38.650 --> 00:09:41.710
How do you measure the forces
that look into the world?

00:09:41.710 --> 00:09:44.085
So we can look at
unemployment, which

00:09:44.085 --> 00:09:47.166
is super exciting--
you guys don't

00:09:47.166 --> 00:09:48.540
have to worry
about unemployment.

00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:54.270
You're self-employed-- marriage,
divorce, mortality, population.

00:09:54.270 --> 00:09:57.910
But essentially what
you can do in this tool

00:09:57.910 --> 00:09:59.630
is find some of the
interesting data that

00:09:59.630 --> 00:10:01.830
will have an impact
on your business.

00:10:01.830 --> 00:10:03.830
So let's look at
unemployment rates.

00:10:03.830 --> 00:10:06.435
Let's imagine you have
an application or a game

00:10:06.435 --> 00:10:10.442
that people spend a lot of time
on when they're unemployed--

00:10:10.442 --> 00:10:15.380
like Facebook, or tell me an
application that you guys have.

00:10:15.380 --> 00:10:15.880
Anyone?

00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:16.505
You make games?

00:10:18.682 --> 00:10:20.140
Yeah, see, if you
don't have a job,

00:10:20.140 --> 00:10:21.790
you're going to play
a lot more games.

00:10:21.790 --> 00:10:25.642
So let's pick out
some countries here

00:10:25.642 --> 00:10:28.700
and see real quickly
how this changes.

00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:31.722
So we can see this over time.

00:10:31.722 --> 00:10:33.940
We can see it on the
graph, like I said.

00:10:33.940 --> 00:10:39.840
But you can actually
get really detailed.

00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:42.564
If you go down to age group,
you can go by age group.

00:10:42.564 --> 00:10:43.980
So maybe you want
a certain amount

00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:46.185
of people in a certain category.

00:10:46.185 --> 00:10:47.810
The other reason that
this tool's great

00:10:47.810 --> 00:10:50.360
is if you are going
towards investors,

00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:52.285
investors always want
to know about the trends

00:10:52.285 --> 00:10:55.230
that impact your business and
how whatever decision you're

00:10:55.230 --> 00:10:57.970
making is about those trends.

00:10:57.970 --> 00:10:59.235
So it's something to consider.

00:10:59.235 --> 00:11:01.160
I'll let you guys do
more with this tool.

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:04.400
Like I said, you can
also ingest data as well

00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:05.552
and keep it private.

00:11:05.552 --> 00:11:07.010
All right, how
about Google Trends?

00:11:07.010 --> 00:11:10.870
How many people have used
Google Trends before?

00:11:10.870 --> 00:11:13.000
This is actually
my favorite tool.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.990
I'll show you some really
cool things on it real fast.

00:11:15.990 --> 00:11:20.495
And they keep changing it,
so it just got new this week.

00:11:20.495 --> 00:11:22.054
This is a problem
with live demos,

00:11:22.054 --> 00:11:23.470
people's always
changing products.

00:11:23.470 --> 00:11:24.700
So I'd stand up here
and I'm like, hey,

00:11:24.700 --> 00:11:26.158
that's not how it
looked yesterday.

00:11:26.158 --> 00:11:28.140
I have no idea what happened.

00:11:28.140 --> 00:11:31.080
So you just go to Google Trends.

00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:33.460
What this is is essentially
Google search data

00:11:33.460 --> 00:11:35.670
across all of
Google's platforms.

00:11:35.670 --> 00:11:38.280
So we also provide search
for other search engines

00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:42.307
as well, like aol.com, a bunch
of those different groups.

00:11:42.307 --> 00:11:44.810
So this is a really
accurate search data.

00:11:44.810 --> 00:11:48.970
If you go to this
Explore section,

00:11:48.970 --> 00:11:51.015
I've got some examples here.

00:11:51.015 --> 00:11:55.220
Let's say digital publishing--
I talked to some folks before.

00:11:55.220 --> 00:11:57.090
So I talked to a
gentleman earlier

00:11:57.090 --> 00:11:59.050
who was interested in
digital publishing.

00:11:59.050 --> 00:12:05.300
So if you want to look here, you
can see this graph over time,

00:12:05.300 --> 00:12:08.390
and then you can look down
here over city and region.

00:12:08.390 --> 00:12:12.200
And then you can see rising
search terms, so potentially

00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:14.200
Adobe Digital
Publishing and whatnot.

00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:19.510
We can also add locations.

00:12:19.510 --> 00:12:21.830
So we're basically taking
all of people's search data

00:12:21.830 --> 00:12:25.043
and adding filters so that we
can seek better information.

00:12:25.043 --> 00:12:27.170
I'm not sure why
I-- time ranges,

00:12:27.170 --> 00:12:30.420
so we'll say the past 12 months.

00:12:30.420 --> 00:12:33.740
So I come down here, I can
see over the past 12 months,

00:12:33.740 --> 00:12:35.250
the change in time.

00:12:35.250 --> 00:12:37.090
If I wanted to, I
could actually do

00:12:37.090 --> 00:12:43.520
this where I go
2013, 2012, 2011.

00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:45.760
So I can see how this industry
has changed over time.

00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:46.770
See what I'm saying?

00:12:46.770 --> 00:12:48.360
So we're looking at
digital publishing

00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:51.109
over these years in the US.

00:12:51.109 --> 00:12:53.150
So what's interesting
about this is how does this

00:12:53.150 --> 00:12:55.265
help you make decisions?

00:12:55.265 --> 00:12:58.750
If we pull out of,
let's say the US--

00:12:58.750 --> 00:13:00.900
I don't know how I
go back to the world,

00:13:00.900 --> 00:13:01.900
they just changed this.

00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:03.930
OK, we're just going to pretend.

00:13:03.930 --> 00:13:05.604
But essentially
what you could do

00:13:05.604 --> 00:13:07.520
is, where do you focus
your marketing dollars?

00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:08.295
Where do you focus your effort?

00:13:08.295 --> 00:13:10.628
These are people who area
already searching for whatever

00:13:10.628 --> 00:13:13.112
you're providing, so
it's worth noting.

00:13:13.112 --> 00:13:14.570
You could also look
at seasonality.

00:13:14.570 --> 00:13:18.110
So it appears that people look
for digital publishing more

00:13:18.110 --> 00:13:21.820
in January, less in
June/July, and then

00:13:21.820 --> 00:13:24.194
more in the upper ranges.

00:13:24.194 --> 00:13:26.485
So if you're going to allocate
your financial resources

00:13:26.485 --> 00:13:29.452
or your own personal time,
you would look at that graph.

00:13:29.452 --> 00:13:31.160
All right, so this is
my family business.

00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:34.010
We do outdoor design, spatial
design, my husband and I. Well,

00:13:34.010 --> 00:13:37.110
mostly him-- I just play
with the numbers mostly.

00:13:37.110 --> 00:13:40.100
But if you look at,
for us for example,

00:13:40.100 --> 00:13:44.430
we have this huge cyclical
factor in our business

00:13:44.430 --> 00:13:46.014
that changes how
we spend our money

00:13:46.014 --> 00:13:47.305
and how we spend our resources.

00:13:47.305 --> 00:13:51.062
We should pretty much just
go on holiday from October

00:13:51.062 --> 00:13:51.770
through December.

00:13:51.770 --> 00:13:54.655
We should just go on
vacation, not work at all.

00:13:54.655 --> 00:13:57.042
There's nothing going on.

00:13:57.042 --> 00:13:58.890
Any one else have an example?

00:13:58.890 --> 00:14:01.285
Actually, I wanted to
show you one more thing

00:14:01.285 --> 00:14:02.550
and this is a real example.

00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:05.122
I helped a guy in the US.

00:14:05.122 --> 00:14:07.640
He lives in New Orleans.

00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:09.850
He runs a macaroon company.

00:14:09.850 --> 00:14:12.890
And macaroons are not as
popular outside of France

00:14:12.890 --> 00:14:14.365
as they are well-known.

00:14:14.365 --> 00:14:16.670
And we were looked
at new areas for him

00:14:16.670 --> 00:14:19.630
to create opportunity
for his business.

00:14:19.630 --> 00:14:23.700
He says that on a search in the
US, he is completely saturated.

00:14:23.700 --> 00:14:26.730
He cannot buy anymore key words.

00:14:26.730 --> 00:14:28.140
He can not do anything else.

00:14:28.140 --> 00:14:29.605
He can't bid on anything else.

00:14:29.605 --> 00:14:32.210
So he looked here
at this map, and we

00:14:32.210 --> 00:14:34.290
could see that
actually Canada has

00:14:34.290 --> 00:14:37.120
more search volume than the US.

00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:38.810
So even though his
business is US,

00:14:38.810 --> 00:14:41.370
he should consider
figuring out how

00:14:41.370 --> 00:14:43.125
to ship his business
to Canada-- like

00:14:43.125 --> 00:14:45.250
to ship some of his
product to Canada.

00:14:45.250 --> 00:14:47.835
If he can figure out Australia,
there's a huge opportunity

00:14:47.835 --> 00:14:50.396
there as well.

00:14:50.396 --> 00:14:52.020
A lot of the times
this is a great tool

00:14:52.020 --> 00:14:54.030
to learn about those
new industries,

00:14:54.030 --> 00:14:56.725
and also to learn how
people in Australia,

00:14:56.725 --> 00:14:59.040
or learn how people
in a certain place

00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:01.652
are actually
searching for things.

00:15:01.652 --> 00:15:03.360
So if I were you guys,
I would definitely

00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:05.407
take time to look at this.

00:15:05.407 --> 00:15:06.490
I think it's really great.

00:15:06.490 --> 00:15:09.550
Up here, too, which we didn't
look at, is all categories.

00:15:09.550 --> 00:15:11.370
So if you're not certain
about what search,

00:15:11.370 --> 00:15:13.780
you can actually get
super, super specific.

00:15:13.780 --> 00:15:16.910
Well, there's no
macaroons in auto and car.

00:15:16.910 --> 00:15:20.290
But if we pull up
auto and car, you

00:15:20.290 --> 00:15:24.620
can just even see these
basic search trends.

00:15:24.620 --> 00:15:28.060
And then you could actually
look at specific vehicles--

00:15:28.060 --> 00:15:30.690
let's say bicycles
and accessories.

00:15:30.690 --> 00:15:33.915
So look at the cyclical
nature of this search

00:15:33.915 --> 00:15:36.720
is-- bikes go up and down.

00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:39.490
So if I were you, I would
spend time on a monthly basis

00:15:39.490 --> 00:15:41.170
to look and see
what trends there

00:15:41.170 --> 00:15:43.870
are that are affecting your
business, your industry.

00:15:43.870 --> 00:15:47.375
On a yearly basis when you're
planning, look at those spikes.

00:15:47.375 --> 00:15:51.090
If you have a travel site, look
at what days of the week people

00:15:51.090 --> 00:15:52.520
look for travel most.

00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:54.320
There is actually
days of the week.

00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:56.640
There are actually
days of the month close

00:15:56.640 --> 00:15:58.734
to holidays that will factor in.

00:15:58.734 --> 00:16:00.775
You want to be smart about
the time and resources

00:16:00.775 --> 00:16:04.088
that you spend and
how they map to data.

00:16:04.088 --> 00:16:05.004
Good?

00:16:05.004 --> 00:16:05.504
Yeah?

00:16:05.504 --> 00:16:06.004
OK.

00:16:06.004 --> 00:16:09.734
You guys are like, this
girl's just talking, talking.

00:16:09.734 --> 00:16:14.820
All right, this is
another really cool tool,

00:16:14.820 --> 00:16:16.760
and it's called
Google Think Insights.

00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:18.860
Anybody know what this is?

00:16:18.860 --> 00:16:21.226
I think I'm going to save
my three Euros that I have.

00:16:21.226 --> 00:16:24.670
It's good-- I need to
take the subway back.

00:16:24.670 --> 00:16:26.780
So basically what this
is, Google actually

00:16:26.780 --> 00:16:29.595
commissions a lot of research
to be done-- research

00:16:29.595 --> 00:16:31.550
about industries,
research about the net,

00:16:31.550 --> 00:16:34.300
web, how industries
are functioning.

00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:37.370
This website has a
ridiculous amount

00:16:37.370 --> 00:16:39.829
of things going on for it.

00:16:39.829 --> 00:16:41.370
If you go down here,
you can actually

00:16:41.370 --> 00:16:45.579
see a lot of case studies,
but there's a ton of data.

00:16:45.579 --> 00:16:47.120
So this is actually
going to tell you

00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:48.699
all the mobile stats for France.

00:16:48.699 --> 00:16:50.490
This is a study on
mobile stats for France.

00:16:50.490 --> 00:16:54.585
This is store insights from
case studies, so uses of phones,

00:16:54.585 --> 00:16:56.460
buying new cars-- these
are all these studies

00:16:56.460 --> 00:16:58.140
that have been commissioned.

00:16:58.140 --> 00:17:01.540
55% of smartphone
owners in France

00:17:01.540 --> 00:17:04.113
access the internet
daily from their device.

00:17:04.113 --> 00:17:06.765
58% of impressions
delivered by YouTube

00:17:06.765 --> 00:17:11.250
reach people who
were exposed to TV.

00:17:11.250 --> 00:17:14.329
There's a whole repository
of really great data

00:17:14.329 --> 00:17:15.626
specific to industries.

00:17:15.626 --> 00:17:18.811
You just search for
countries, for industries.

00:17:18.811 --> 00:17:20.560
All of the data that
we commission and all

00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:22.420
of the industry
reports are there.

00:17:22.420 --> 00:17:25.790
So that's super
cool, really concise.

00:17:25.790 --> 00:17:29.270
They have a infographic
creator on here as well,

00:17:29.270 --> 00:17:30.230
it's very interesting.

00:17:30.230 --> 00:17:33.000
At the end of the day, what
I would do is figure out what

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:35.145
sources-- it could not
even be these sources--

00:17:35.145 --> 00:17:38.000
are reliable for you for data.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:41.130
What numbers do you need to
know every month, every quarter,

00:17:41.130 --> 00:17:42.740
in order to figure
out how to spend

00:17:42.740 --> 00:17:44.700
your time and your money
and your resources,

00:17:44.700 --> 00:17:46.940
and how to make your
products better?

00:17:46.940 --> 00:17:48.906
This is another one
which I won't go through,

00:17:48.906 --> 00:17:53.410
but it's focused on mobile
trends and mobile devices.

00:17:53.410 --> 00:17:56.015
It's called Think Mobile,
or Our Mobile Planet.

00:17:56.015 --> 00:17:57.640
It's actually called
Our Mobile Planet.

00:17:57.640 --> 00:17:59.400
It's also a site
created by Google

00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:01.560
that has a ton of
mobile-specific trends

00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:02.810
and data.

00:18:02.810 --> 00:18:06.070
If you think about all these
marketplaces in the world,

00:18:06.070 --> 00:18:09.520
there are often cheaper ways
for you to get customers.

00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:13.357
There's Chrome Web Store,
there's the Google Apps

00:18:13.357 --> 00:18:15.190
Marketplace, there's a
whole bunch of these.

00:18:15.190 --> 00:18:19.490
Also a lot of good marketplaces
to get things done cheaper.

00:18:19.490 --> 00:18:24.210
So at 99designs, this is a
marketplace for designers,

00:18:24.210 --> 00:18:26.890
this is about your
data as a company.

00:18:26.890 --> 00:18:28.270
How do you deal with your data?

00:18:28.270 --> 00:18:31.200
How do you make sense of it?

00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:35.120
So this is always one
of my favorite examples.

00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:36.690
You can't tell
very well on this,

00:18:36.690 --> 00:18:39.430
but who knows this
top box in Google?

00:18:39.430 --> 00:18:43.149
It's basically our most coveted,
most prized position right

00:18:43.149 --> 00:18:43.830
on Google.

00:18:43.830 --> 00:18:47.865
If you can manage to bid and
also have a high quality score,

00:18:47.865 --> 00:18:50.350
you can be on the
very top of Google.

00:18:50.350 --> 00:18:52.475
The color of that
box-- anybody want

00:18:52.475 --> 00:18:54.521
to tell me what the
color, you can't see it

00:18:54.521 --> 00:18:57.451
very well here, but
the color of that box?

00:18:57.451 --> 00:18:57.950
Anybody?

00:18:57.950 --> 00:18:58.787
Color?

00:18:58.787 --> 00:19:00.375
It's kind of like pink.

00:19:00.375 --> 00:19:02.860
Kind of fleshy, like peach.

00:19:02.860 --> 00:19:05.240
It's pretty ugly, right?

00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:07.750
Like, who would have guessed
that the most expensive

00:19:07.750 --> 00:19:10.740
real estate on our
site would be peach?

00:19:10.740 --> 00:19:14.675
I would never guess
this-- seems terrible.

00:19:14.675 --> 00:19:16.760
Actually, over the years
that color has changed.

00:19:16.760 --> 00:19:20.780
I mean, hues of the same
color-- blues, greens, oranges,

00:19:20.780 --> 00:19:23.250
yellows, all different colors.

00:19:23.250 --> 00:19:25.010
And the reason is
because we have goals.

00:19:25.010 --> 00:19:26.935
Every website, everything
on your website

00:19:26.935 --> 00:19:28.970
or your application
should have a goal.

00:19:28.970 --> 00:19:31.130
The goal of our most
important real estate

00:19:31.130 --> 00:19:32.080
is to do two things.

00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:35.790
It is to, first of
all, not annoy you.

00:19:35.790 --> 00:19:38.070
If this was bright red
or fluorescent green,

00:19:38.070 --> 00:19:40.950
you'd be like, oh my
goodness, this is awful.

00:19:40.950 --> 00:19:41.905
I hate Google.

00:19:41.905 --> 00:19:43.670
That is the worst color ever.

00:19:43.670 --> 00:19:45.990
And you would go to use some
other search engine, which

00:19:45.990 --> 00:19:49.620
I don't even know
what's out there.

00:19:49.620 --> 00:19:52.530
But the other goal is
to make money, right?

00:19:52.530 --> 00:19:54.940
We want people, if this
is a good advertisement,

00:19:54.940 --> 00:19:57.650
to choose to click
on it, correct?

00:19:57.650 --> 00:19:58.775
So those are the two goals.

00:19:58.775 --> 00:20:00.920
So with those two
goals in mind, this

00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:02.492
was the color that
we came up with.

00:20:02.492 --> 00:20:04.590
In the short-term, if
we made this hot pink,

00:20:04.590 --> 00:20:06.280
we could probably
get more people

00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:08.490
to click on it for two
days, and then they

00:20:08.490 --> 00:20:09.900
would never come back.

00:20:09.900 --> 00:20:11.920
Whatever application
or website you have,

00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:15.520
the most important elements
of your site you have to test.

00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:17.090
You have to try
different things.

00:20:17.090 --> 00:20:18.710
I would never have
chosen this color--

00:20:18.710 --> 00:20:21.090
my instinct would be wrong.

00:20:21.090 --> 00:20:23.680
Through the data, this is the
color that we have chosen,

00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:27.590
because it achieves our
two goals correctly.

00:20:27.590 --> 00:20:30.045
So now I'm going to
play a little game.

00:20:30.045 --> 00:20:32.080
Everybody ready
to play this game?

00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:34.440
I love games.

00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:37.824
And we're going to talk about
how wrong your intuition is.

00:20:37.824 --> 00:20:39.115
This is the point of this game.

00:20:39.115 --> 00:20:40.115
Isn't that a great game?

00:20:40.115 --> 00:20:43.160
The point of the game
is for you to be wrong.

00:20:43.160 --> 00:20:49.320
So back in 2008 when Obama
ran for President in the US,

00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:53.410
there was a group that helped
him optimize his website.

00:20:53.410 --> 00:20:55.760
They used a tool called
Website Optimizer, which

00:20:55.760 --> 00:20:57.210
no longer exists.

00:20:57.210 --> 00:20:59.870
It's now called
Content Experiments.

00:20:59.870 --> 00:21:01.390
It's in Analytics.

00:21:01.390 --> 00:21:03.605
You want me to write that
down for you, I will--

00:21:03.605 --> 00:21:04.750
it's very complicated.

00:21:04.750 --> 00:21:07.920
There's also a non-Google
product called Optimize Link.

00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:11.540
Basically what it allows
you to do is ABC test.

00:21:11.540 --> 00:21:15.465
So to test different versions
of your sites towards a goal.

00:21:15.465 --> 00:21:18.480
A lot of people test their
website and have no goal.

00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:22.660
If you have no goal, you should
just shut it down and go home.

00:21:22.660 --> 00:21:27.830
So the goal of this site
was to get more people

00:21:27.830 --> 00:21:32.560
to sign up to volunteer, which
you can see at the bottom,

00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:34.622
and to get more people
to donate money.

00:21:34.622 --> 00:21:35.955
And they also wanted volunteers.

00:21:35.955 --> 00:21:39.730
So the goal is he wants
people to come to this site,

00:21:39.730 --> 00:21:41.220
take action.

00:21:41.220 --> 00:21:43.460
And then he wants them
to subsequently continue

00:21:43.460 --> 00:21:47.214
on that site, donate money,
volunteer, those things.

00:21:47.214 --> 00:21:48.630
So you guys are
all going to vote.

00:21:48.630 --> 00:21:51.950
There's two things that were
tested-- the large image which

00:21:51.950 --> 00:21:55.751
you can see there and
then this red button.

00:21:55.751 --> 00:21:57.500
So I'm going to show
you first the images.

00:21:57.500 --> 00:21:59.290
You're going to vote
on one through three.

00:21:59.290 --> 00:22:00.560
I'm going to show
you four buttons,

00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:02.512
and then we're going to
see who gets it right.

00:22:02.512 --> 00:22:06.440
There's nothing to
win except awesome.

00:22:06.440 --> 00:22:10.472
So who votes number one?

00:22:10.472 --> 00:22:11.780
OK, great.

00:22:11.780 --> 00:22:14.065
Who votes number two?

00:22:14.065 --> 00:22:15.380
OK, great.

00:22:15.380 --> 00:22:17.212
Who votes number three?

00:22:17.212 --> 00:22:17.976
OK.

00:22:17.976 --> 00:22:19.470
All right, you guys ready?

00:22:19.470 --> 00:22:21.420
So these are the options.

00:22:21.420 --> 00:22:27.120
Who votes the button Sign Up
is the most effective button?

00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:28.590
One guy, two guys, good.

00:22:28.590 --> 00:22:30.430
Way to stick with
your conviction.

00:22:30.430 --> 00:22:32.700
Number two, Learn More?

00:22:32.700 --> 00:22:33.850
OK, a few more.

00:22:33.850 --> 00:22:36.500
Number three, Join Us Now?

00:22:36.500 --> 00:22:37.280
Solid.

00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:40.510
Number four, Sign Up Now?

00:22:40.510 --> 00:22:43.390
So what I'm going to show
you is a very old interface

00:22:43.390 --> 00:22:45.920
of the Website Optimizer.

00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:48.210
So what we can see
here is the combination

00:22:48.210 --> 00:22:51.505
that was most effective is
the family image, which I'll

00:22:51.505 --> 00:22:56.360
go back to, and then
the button Learn More.

00:22:56.360 --> 00:22:59.330
And the results of this,
so the delta, what we mean

00:22:59.330 --> 00:23:02.730
is the trajectory of the
first site versus the end

00:23:02.730 --> 00:23:03.860
result of the second site.

00:23:03.860 --> 00:23:08.470
So the difference was actually
2.8 more subscriptions,

00:23:08.470 --> 00:23:16.680
2.8 million people signed up,
$57 million more was donated,

00:23:16.680 --> 00:23:20.670
based on a button and an image.

00:23:20.670 --> 00:23:22.660
So the original
one-- I'll show you

00:23:22.660 --> 00:23:25.230
this one was actually the
original one right here.

00:23:25.230 --> 00:23:26.840
It looks good, right?

00:23:26.840 --> 00:23:31.610
It doesn't look like the family
image, which we'll go back to.

00:23:31.610 --> 00:23:36.020
That doesn't look $57 million
more awesome, does it?

00:23:36.020 --> 00:23:40.670
I mean, it definitely
doesn't, but it actually was.

00:23:40.670 --> 00:23:46.210
So my message here is, you
have to trust the data.

00:23:46.210 --> 00:23:49.470
Sometimes our intuition
is that we made a website.

00:23:49.470 --> 00:23:53.550
We made an application and
it's amazing, and we love it.

00:23:53.550 --> 00:23:55.750
And your mom loves it,
and your wife loves it,

00:23:55.750 --> 00:23:57.260
and your girlfriend loves it.

00:23:57.260 --> 00:24:01.450
But the reality is
if the users love it.

00:24:01.450 --> 00:24:04.910
Small changes can make a
huge impact on your sites.

00:24:04.910 --> 00:24:06.410
My recommendation
is if you're going

00:24:06.410 --> 00:24:08.880
to test, test the
most important things.

00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:11.170
If you notice, he didn't
change the entire site.

00:24:11.170 --> 00:24:15.430
Even though it looks like
it, the fields are the same.

00:24:15.430 --> 00:24:17.014
It's just the image
and the button

00:24:17.014 --> 00:24:18.180
because that's what matters.

00:24:18.180 --> 00:24:21.090
So things to test on your
site, the more simple

00:24:21.090 --> 00:24:23.470
the better, the less
text the better, the less

00:24:23.470 --> 00:24:24.940
fields the better.

00:24:24.940 --> 00:24:27.155
Consolidating the
first experience-- so

00:24:27.155 --> 00:24:28.540
this was the first experience.

00:24:28.540 --> 00:24:30.820
I'm sure after this you had
to sign up for something

00:24:30.820 --> 00:24:33.490
else-- you had to enter a credit
card, you had to do something

00:24:33.490 --> 00:24:34.545
to pay this person.

00:24:34.545 --> 00:24:38.020
But the reality is that first
experience, that entry point,

00:24:38.020 --> 00:24:40.680
was really easy
and it was tested.

00:24:40.680 --> 00:24:44.050
It was something
that was data-driven.

00:24:44.050 --> 00:24:50.330
So now that I've convinced
you to all test your websites,

00:24:50.330 --> 00:24:53.080
how many people use
Google Analytics in here?

00:24:53.080 --> 00:24:54.980
It's free and it's amazing.

00:24:54.980 --> 00:24:57.230
So I would definitely use it.

00:24:57.230 --> 00:24:57.730
I use it.

00:24:57.730 --> 00:24:59.030
I love it.

00:24:59.030 --> 00:25:00.790
How I use this
tool functionally,

00:25:00.790 --> 00:25:02.390
I also use AdWords.

00:25:02.390 --> 00:25:04.830
So every day I get an email.

00:25:04.830 --> 00:25:05.980
There's custom reports.

00:25:05.980 --> 00:25:09.450
You can still have custom
reports in Analytics.

00:25:09.450 --> 00:25:11.840
And I only get two numbers
sent to me every day,

00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:14.690
because there's so
much data in Analytics.

00:25:14.690 --> 00:25:17.030
When you get in there,
you're like, whoa,

00:25:17.030 --> 00:25:20.000
this is really confusing
and I don't even

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:21.815
know what I care about anymore.

00:25:21.815 --> 00:25:23.440
Before you open your
Analytics account,

00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:25.670
you should write
down-- literally,

00:25:25.670 --> 00:25:28.420
not joking-- write down the
questions that you have.

00:25:28.420 --> 00:25:30.540
Like, where is my
company doing the best?

00:25:30.540 --> 00:25:32.880
How much of my cost
per conversion?

00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:34.980
Where's my traffic coming from?

00:25:34.980 --> 00:25:38.485
Which of the social
media outlets I'm doing

00:25:38.485 --> 00:25:40.110
are not just bringing
the most traffic,

00:25:40.110 --> 00:25:42.770
but bringing the
most conversions?

00:25:42.770 --> 00:25:45.405
You need to think about
what data is actually

00:25:45.405 --> 00:25:47.830
meaningful to your
business, and the rest of it

00:25:47.830 --> 00:25:49.890
just worry about on
a quarterly basis.

00:25:49.890 --> 00:25:53.184
Because you honestly just can't
ingest that much information,

00:25:53.184 --> 00:25:55.210
I can't, on a daily basis.

00:25:55.210 --> 00:25:57.260
So I set up automated
emails, customer

00:25:57.260 --> 00:26:02.740
reports every single day-- I get
cost per conversion every day,

00:26:02.740 --> 00:26:04.690
and basically the
number of conversions.

00:26:04.690 --> 00:26:07.310
And then on a weekly basis,
I look up other information,

00:26:07.310 --> 00:26:09.650
because that's really
all I care about.

00:26:09.650 --> 00:26:12.430
Everything else is just noise.

00:26:12.430 --> 00:26:15.710
It's useful noise, but
it's not useful every day.

00:26:15.710 --> 00:26:17.189
It's not useful
every minute to me.

00:26:17.189 --> 00:26:18.980
So I would think about
that with Analytics.

00:26:18.980 --> 00:26:21.090
Do, do, do set up
customer reporting.

00:26:21.090 --> 00:26:24.110
It'll come to your email or
your phone or whatever you want.

00:26:24.110 --> 00:26:27.590
And think about if you had to
have two pieces of information

00:26:27.590 --> 00:26:29.640
every morning that would
help you make a better

00:26:29.640 --> 00:26:32.510
business, what would
they be, or the three?

00:26:32.510 --> 00:26:34.115
And narrow it down,
because it will

00:26:34.115 --> 00:26:37.037
help you drive better customers,
better users-- whatever

00:26:37.037 --> 00:26:38.620
it is that you're
looking to do, it'll

00:26:38.620 --> 00:26:42.570
make the customer experience
and your experience better.

00:26:42.570 --> 00:26:45.340
So this is just a
random tip of the day.

00:26:45.340 --> 00:26:47.390
If you have internal
search-- how many people

00:26:47.390 --> 00:26:49.950
have internal search on
their website or application,

00:26:49.950 --> 00:26:52.010
whatever they're working on?

00:26:52.010 --> 00:26:54.130
People never look at
internal search on Analytics.

00:26:54.130 --> 00:26:56.046
It's basically if you
have a search box inside

00:26:56.046 --> 00:26:59.400
of your actual website, those
are people telling you exactly

00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:02.946
what they're looking for and
that they cannot find it.

00:27:02.946 --> 00:27:05.809
If you match that, plus if
you were to come to your site,

00:27:05.809 --> 00:27:07.350
there's a lot of
interesting analysis

00:27:07.350 --> 00:27:09.219
you can do there on
an individual basis.

00:27:09.219 --> 00:27:10.510
So I could consider doing that.

00:27:13.380 --> 00:27:14.305
Last area.

00:27:14.305 --> 00:27:17.570
I promise I will sit down.

00:27:17.570 --> 00:27:18.970
This is really
about social, even

00:27:18.970 --> 00:27:20.780
though I didn't put social.

00:27:20.780 --> 00:27:23.165
You have a community
of people, hopefully,

00:27:23.165 --> 00:27:25.090
like a social community
and other community

00:27:25.090 --> 00:27:26.590
that are influencers.

00:27:26.590 --> 00:27:29.520
Most people treat, not only
every single social media,

00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:32.915
but every single user the same.

00:27:32.915 --> 00:27:35.230
That is completely wrong.

00:27:35.230 --> 00:27:38.080
This is Google Ripples,
which is in Google+.

00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:40.385
Essentially what it shows
is when I post something--

00:27:40.385 --> 00:27:43.886
this is not me posting because
I'm not the Dalai Lama, which

00:27:43.886 --> 00:27:45.260
is actually the
person who posted

00:27:45.260 --> 00:27:46.426
this which is kind of weird.

00:27:46.426 --> 00:27:51.464
But essentially, when I post
something, who are the people

00:27:51.464 --> 00:27:53.630
that are actually sharing
who are having the biggest

00:27:53.630 --> 00:27:55.750
influence?

00:27:55.750 --> 00:27:57.160
Those people are influencers.

00:27:57.160 --> 00:27:58.280
Those are my salesmen.

00:27:58.280 --> 00:27:59.385
Those are my marketers.

00:27:59.385 --> 00:28:01.220
Those are my people
who are out there

00:28:01.220 --> 00:28:03.130
selling my products for me.

00:28:03.130 --> 00:28:05.150
I should not ignore them.

00:28:05.150 --> 00:28:06.940
They should be different.

00:28:06.940 --> 00:28:08.590
They're literally
three salesmen,

00:28:08.590 --> 00:28:10.790
three marketing people to you.

00:28:10.790 --> 00:28:12.900
So I will tell you a
little lesson here.

00:28:12.900 --> 00:28:14.770
This is Google Docs.

00:28:14.770 --> 00:28:16.595
We have people
every single day who

00:28:16.595 --> 00:28:18.130
are not employed
by Google who spend

00:28:18.130 --> 00:28:21.570
hours and hours, literally
their entire day almost,

00:28:21.570 --> 00:28:23.405
contributing to the
Google Docs forum.

00:28:23.405 --> 00:28:27.100
They are not Google employees,
they just love our products.

00:28:27.100 --> 00:28:28.850
They are just like
those people who

00:28:28.850 --> 00:28:30.360
are here who are influencers.

00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:32.180
They're the same
people who are really

00:28:32.180 --> 00:28:33.745
in love with our products.

00:28:33.745 --> 00:28:34.962
We send them swag.

00:28:34.962 --> 00:28:37.420
We send them tickets to Google
I/O. When there's a problem,

00:28:37.420 --> 00:28:38.523
we call them.

00:28:38.523 --> 00:28:39.850
We have their email addresses.

00:28:39.850 --> 00:28:42.180
We engage with these
people because they

00:28:42.180 --> 00:28:43.980
are our front line.

00:28:43.980 --> 00:28:46.570
They are the people who are
making our products better.

00:28:46.570 --> 00:28:48.570
We call them up-- how
do we fix the products?

00:28:48.570 --> 00:28:49.236
What's going on?

00:28:49.236 --> 00:28:50.485
Do you see an issue here?

00:28:50.485 --> 00:28:52.790
Do you see a problem there?

00:28:52.790 --> 00:28:54.700
You need to take care
of the people who

00:28:54.700 --> 00:28:57.439
are taking care of you,
and those influencers.

00:28:57.439 --> 00:28:59.730
So if you have a lot of people
who re-share your posts,

00:28:59.730 --> 00:29:02.997
your tweets, whatever it
is, don't ignore them.

00:29:02.997 --> 00:29:04.830
Get in touch with them
individually and say,

00:29:04.830 --> 00:29:06.690
hey, I want your
product feedback.

00:29:06.690 --> 00:29:09.290
I want to have a
relationship with you.

00:29:09.290 --> 00:29:10.890
I want to talk to you.

00:29:10.890 --> 00:29:12.920
Because they are
literally free employees.

00:29:12.920 --> 00:29:16.670
These are people who are working
every day to make Docs better

00:29:16.670 --> 00:29:20.960
without our guidance, so
do not ignore those people.

00:29:20.960 --> 00:29:23.390
And those people
are in your data.

00:29:23.390 --> 00:29:26.120
So if you don't take time
to look at the data that's

00:29:26.120 --> 00:29:28.440
influencing your business,
you will not find them--

00:29:28.440 --> 00:29:32.432
so we recommend that you do.

00:29:32.432 --> 00:29:36.390
This is my last but best slide.

00:29:36.390 --> 00:29:39.920
The other thing I think about
with data is a lot of people

00:29:39.920 --> 00:29:43.176
look at crowd source funding
as a way to make money.

00:29:43.176 --> 00:29:45.217
How many of you guys have
ever had a crowd source

00:29:45.217 --> 00:29:46.396
funding campaign?

00:29:46.396 --> 00:29:48.745
You guys know what
crowd source funding is?

00:29:48.745 --> 00:29:53.573
So essentially you make a
video pitch about your product.

00:29:53.573 --> 00:29:55.320
You put it online.

00:29:55.320 --> 00:29:58.285
This is a site called Indiegogo
which is actually global.

00:29:58.285 --> 00:30:00.820
You can actually fundraise here.

00:30:00.820 --> 00:30:03.080
You send it out there,
you try to send it

00:30:03.080 --> 00:30:07.700
to your whole network and
get people to submit funds

00:30:07.700 --> 00:30:10.040
to your project, or
your business idea,

00:30:10.040 --> 00:30:13.278
or whatever you're
doing-- like Kickstarter.

00:30:13.278 --> 00:30:15.965
Often though what people
do is if you donate,

00:30:15.965 --> 00:30:18.400
let's say, five euro--
I think this guy was

00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:21.480
$5-- he will actually
send you the first version

00:30:21.480 --> 00:30:24.560
of his product for free, or
he'll give you early access

00:30:24.560 --> 00:30:25.620
to the application.

00:30:25.620 --> 00:30:28.252
These are people who are willing
to pay for a product that

00:30:28.252 --> 00:30:31.140
does not exist and
may never exist.

00:30:31.140 --> 00:30:33.190
This is real
customer validation.

00:30:33.190 --> 00:30:36.320
This is people who are willing
to pay for your product

00:30:36.320 --> 00:30:37.790
before you've created it.

00:30:37.790 --> 00:30:38.450
That's data.

00:30:38.450 --> 00:30:44.590
That's data about
$62,572 worth of money

00:30:44.590 --> 00:30:46.880
that somebody gave to
you based on your product

00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:48.740
idea without even the product.

00:30:48.740 --> 00:30:51.080
Or based on the idea, the
hope, that it will exist

00:30:51.080 --> 00:30:52.530
and they will get it.

00:30:52.530 --> 00:30:54.965
So the reason I
like this example,

00:30:54.965 --> 00:30:56.740
it's a little bit funny.

00:30:56.740 --> 00:30:58.850
I'm going to play
this video for you

00:30:58.850 --> 00:31:00.836
because this man
is 78 years old.

00:31:00.836 --> 00:31:03.645
Is there anyone in here
that's older than 78?

00:31:03.645 --> 00:31:06.640
OK, so if he can make a crowd
source funding campaign,

00:31:06.640 --> 00:31:08.240
so can you.

00:31:08.240 --> 00:31:10.330
And he is actually pretty rich.

00:31:10.330 --> 00:31:12.885
He's already made a product
that's done very, very well.

00:31:12.885 --> 00:31:16.250
And he could go out there on
his own and build a product

00:31:16.250 --> 00:31:19.930
and send it to market without
any help from any of us.

00:31:19.930 --> 00:31:22.210
But he was like, I'm not
quite sure if people really

00:31:22.210 --> 00:31:25.030
want this, and I'm wondering if
they're willing to pay for it.

00:31:25.030 --> 00:31:27.950
So I want to raise money just
to see, and that's what he did.

00:31:27.950 --> 00:31:32.090
I'm going to show you this video
just because it's super funny.

00:31:32.090 --> 00:31:34.795
How many of you guys think you
should create a crowd source

00:31:34.795 --> 00:31:36.810
funding campaign after this?

00:31:36.810 --> 00:31:38.520
Yeah?

00:31:38.520 --> 00:31:40.130
Well, if you guys
have time, there's

00:31:40.130 --> 00:31:42.380
some really good videos,
especially on Indiegogo

00:31:42.380 --> 00:31:45.330
site to tell you good tips
and tricks for raising funds.

00:31:45.330 --> 00:31:47.712
But I would always
think of this as data.

00:31:47.712 --> 00:31:49.670
Again, people often think
of it as fundraising,

00:31:49.670 --> 00:31:50.670
but it's very different.

00:31:50.670 --> 00:31:52.666
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:31:52.666 --> 00:31:54.163
-Yuck!

00:31:54.163 --> 00:31:55.660
Dog breath.

00:31:55.660 --> 00:31:56.330
Let's rewind.

00:32:03.310 --> 00:32:07.016
Dogs are adorable, but
they lick everything.

00:32:07.016 --> 00:32:09.920
That's why we invented
Orapup, the solution that

00:32:09.920 --> 00:32:12.108
helps cure dog breath
in less than a minute.

00:32:12.108 --> 00:32:15.870
-Dog bad breath is one of the
major concerns of dog owners.

00:32:15.870 --> 00:32:19.130
-All we can really recommend
is to brush their teeth.

00:32:19.130 --> 00:32:23.072
People don't do it because
their dogs don't like it.

00:32:23.072 --> 00:32:24.822
-Even when they let
you brush their teeth,

00:32:24.822 --> 00:32:25.947
it won't solve the problem.

00:32:25.947 --> 00:32:28.580
Studies show that 90%
of bad breath in humans

00:32:28.580 --> 00:32:29.953
comes from the tongue.

00:32:29.953 --> 00:32:30.494
-I'm Dr. Bob.

00:32:30.494 --> 00:32:34.470
10 years ago I invented
Orabrush, a tongue cleaner

00:32:34.470 --> 00:32:36.280
that helps cure bad breath.

00:32:36.280 --> 00:32:39.890
After people started using
the Orabrush for themselves,

00:32:39.890 --> 00:32:43.210
they requested that we create
an Orabrush for their dog.

00:32:43.210 --> 00:32:45.312
-Orabrush, you need to
make one for dogs now.

00:32:45.312 --> 00:32:46.785
That'd be good, wouldn't it?

00:32:46.785 --> 00:32:49.240
-How do you get a dog to
let you clean its tongue?

00:32:49.240 --> 00:32:52.260
You don't-- you
let the dog do it.

00:32:52.260 --> 00:32:55.057
-Having a system where the
dog would clean its own tongue

00:32:55.057 --> 00:32:58.695
is very beneficial to both
the owner and to the dog.

00:32:58.695 --> 00:33:00.315
-It's not a chore.

00:33:00.315 --> 00:33:01.840
It's more like a treat.

00:33:01.840 --> 00:33:04.402
-Ultra soft, pointed
bristles clean teeth and--

00:33:04.402 --> 00:33:05.235
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:33:05.235 --> 00:33:06.221
BRIDGETTE BEAM: All
right, you don't

00:33:06.221 --> 00:33:07.700
need to watch the whole thing.

00:33:07.700 --> 00:33:11.560
But it's really interesting--
hundreds of thousands of people

00:33:11.560 --> 00:33:14.285
contributed to this campaign
in order to buy one of these

00:33:14.285 --> 00:33:16.650
before the product existed.

00:33:16.650 --> 00:33:18.190
So that's real customer data.

00:33:18.190 --> 00:33:20.440
And if I were you,
I would definitely

00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:22.640
reconsider how you think
about crowd source funding.

00:33:22.640 --> 00:33:25.144
It's not just about
getting funds.

00:33:25.144 --> 00:33:27.185
It's really about creating
those first customers.

00:33:27.185 --> 00:33:29.000
Creating those
influencers of people

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:31.850
who are going to go out there
and talk about your products.

00:33:31.850 --> 00:33:34.550
They're willing to give
you money on a hope.

00:33:34.550 --> 00:33:36.370
That's pretty incredible.

00:33:36.370 --> 00:33:38.350
So I would think
about this question--

00:33:38.350 --> 00:33:40.520
what data drives your startup?

00:33:40.520 --> 00:33:42.500
There's a lot of data out there.

00:33:42.500 --> 00:33:45.730
You should always have
two numbers every morning

00:33:45.730 --> 00:33:49.416
you wake up to that help
you make your decisions.

00:33:49.416 --> 00:33:50.790
And you should
always think about

00:33:50.790 --> 00:33:51.970
what are the macro forces?

00:33:51.970 --> 00:33:53.910
What are the
industry world forces

00:33:53.910 --> 00:33:55.960
that make my business
very successful,

00:33:55.960 --> 00:33:59.566
or make my business
unsuccessful?

00:33:59.566 --> 00:34:01.372
Because I think
too often we know

00:34:01.372 --> 00:34:02.830
that there's data
out there, but we

00:34:02.830 --> 00:34:05.000
don't take the time to
make it meaningful to us.

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:07.435
And if you guys are a
startup, you have limited time

00:34:07.435 --> 00:34:10.489
and you need to figure
out how to do that.

00:34:10.489 --> 00:34:12.409
So here's my
exciting takeaways--

00:34:12.409 --> 00:34:14.258
it's basically what I just said.

00:34:14.258 --> 00:34:16.030
Should have just
turned to the slide.

00:34:16.030 --> 00:34:17.429
And that's it.

00:34:17.429 --> 00:34:19.389
I'm here all day.

00:34:19.389 --> 00:34:21.679
I'm happy to talk about
pretty much anything.

00:34:21.679 --> 00:34:26.639
As you see, I like talking, so
that's not a problem for me.

00:34:26.639 --> 00:34:28.300
But I'm really glad
you guys joined us.

00:34:28.300 --> 00:34:30.270
We really hope to add value.

00:34:30.270 --> 00:34:33.860
Each Googler is here to add
value to your company today.

00:34:33.860 --> 00:34:36.310
So please take advantage
of that opportunity.

00:34:36.310 --> 00:34:37.370
Thank you very much.

00:34:37.370 --> 00:34:47.914
