00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.290
NARRATOR: This photo looks
like a scene straight out

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:08.310
of "Game of Thrones."

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:11.750
The large army, the blazing
fire, the medieval weapons--

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:14.580
like they're preparing
for some grand battle.

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.530
But this photo was taken
only a couple of years ago,

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:20.640
and, I mean, Westeros
isn't in real place.

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:29.530
The person watching these
marching men was this woman.

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:31.370
ALICE HEYWOOD: My
name is Alice Heywood,

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:33.910
and I grew up in
California, but I've

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:38.860
lived in Edinburgh for 17 years,
and I work in digital learning

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:41.200
at the National
Library of Scotland.

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:44.580
I'm also a keen, but very
amateur, photographer.

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:47.670
This photo was taken in
Lerwick, or as the natives would

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.610
call it, Lare-ick, on
the Shetland Islands

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.730
in Scotland at the start of
the Up Helly Aa festival.

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:57.810
NARRATOR: For 24 hours on the
last Tuesday of every January,

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:00.280
the Up Helly Aa Fire
Festival commences

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:03.120
on the Shetland Islands
off the coast of Scotland.

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.490
The event, which began in
1870, celebrate the island's

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:08.710
Scandinavian Viking heritage.

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:11.977
Up to 1,000 men from the
islands parade with burning

00:01:11.977 --> 00:01:13.560
torches around the
streets of Lerwick,

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.762
while hundreds of people,
like Alice, gather to watch.

00:01:16.762 --> 00:01:18.220
ALICE HEYWOOD: The
Shetland Islands

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:21.170
didn't become part of Scotland
until the 15th century,

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:23.980
and so this festival
celebrates these Viking roots.

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:27.730
The men you see this photograph
are dressed in Viking costumes

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:30.180
compete with helmets
and axes, all of which

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.960
they get custom made
especially for this day.

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.860
The men make up the
Jarl Squad, or Earl,

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:38.060
as he would be known
in English, and they're

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.315
the only ones who get the
privilege of dressing up

00:01:40.315 --> 00:01:41.830
like Vikings.

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:44.923
The rest of the men make up some
of the 40 to 50 other squads,

00:01:44.923 --> 00:01:48.965
each of whom dress up
with a particular theme.

00:01:48.965 --> 00:01:50.965
This can range from the
wacky to the outrageous,

00:01:50.965 --> 00:01:54.560
from farmers to drag queens,
and everything in between.

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.060
NARRATOR: And they
don't stop there.

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:59.680
Each year, the Jarl Squad
builds a replica Viking ship

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:01.970
and hauls it along the
head of the procession,

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:04.960
while the rest of the men
throw their torches into it.

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.760
Everyone watches it burn while
singing the traditional chant

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:09.115
and cheering amidst the flames.

00:02:09.115 --> 00:02:10.990
ALICE HEYWOOD: The party
then gets under way,

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:12.615
which lasts all night.

00:02:12.615 --> 00:02:16.730
And when I mean all night,
I literally mean all night.

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:18.524
NARRATOR: The Scottish
know how to party,

00:02:18.524 --> 00:02:20.940
but more than that, they know
what it means to have pried,

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.677
to recognize their roots,
and that's worth celebrating.

00:02:24.677 --> 00:02:26.760
ALICE HEYWOOD: It's a truly
spectacular event that

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.400
recalls the important cultural
and historic ties to Norway,

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.730
but it's also very distinct to
Shetland and Scotland, which

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:36.207
is what I love most about it.

00:02:36.207 --> 00:02:38.040
NARRATOR: Hey, everyone,
thanks for watching

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:38.910
"This Happened Here."

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:40.868
If you liked this episode,
be sure to check out

00:02:40.868 --> 00:02:43.336
this one on a controversial
sex float in the Netherlands.

00:02:43.336 --> 00:02:45.710
SUBJECT 2: This float was made
by the district Veldstraat

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:46.760
from Zundert.

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:48.870
The designer wanted to
do something different

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.080
from the nice or funny scenes,
and cause some discussion

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:53.960
without being vulgar.

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:57.300
NARRATOR: So he made a float
about censorship Thanks

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:58.930
for watching.
