1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:02,670
The Joe Rogan experience,

2
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:06,150
what race races that Lee's gonna
run and don't run those races. Yeah.

3
00:00:06,151 --> 00:00:07,800
Run a different run a different race.

4
00:00:07,801 --> 00:00:11,880
That's always been money you feel about
trans athletes, you know? Uh, it's a good,

5
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:13,260
it's a good question.
I think it's,

6
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:17,550
we're really going to go through
like a cultural change on how we

7
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:20,400
think about that, you know, and
it's, it's morphing so quickly,

8
00:00:20,401 --> 00:00:22,980
you know what I mean? Um, uh,

9
00:00:22,981 --> 00:00:27,840
I'm very much because I am of this opinion
that there is no such thing as like

10
00:00:27,841 --> 00:00:30,030
perfect fairness.
And when we make those distinctions,

11
00:00:30,031 --> 00:00:34,680
we're always choosing who to allow and
because I think we should choose to allow

12
00:00:34,681 --> 00:00:36,690
like trans people to
participate in society.

13
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:40,140
I'm for and inclusive approach where,
you know,

14
00:00:40,141 --> 00:00:42,030
we're able to like find a,

15
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:46,500
find like a model that allows those
folks to compete fairly in a way that

16
00:00:46,501 --> 00:00:49,770
everybody's happy with. I think that's
the, I think that's what we should do,

17
00:00:49,771 --> 00:00:53,820
you know? Um, and that to me is like,
that's what makes me like sports more,

18
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:57,810
you know? Um, is those
comparisons like um, you know,

19
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:01,140
another thing that pissed me off so much
was like, ah, fuck, what's his name?

20
00:01:01,141 --> 00:01:04,640
The um, the disabled runner
who then killed his girlfriend.

21
00:01:04,990 --> 00:01:05,591
Oh yeah.

22
00:01:05,591 --> 00:01:10,591
The [inaudible] and people were
saying about this guy that his,

23
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:13,960
that is a, a prosthetic gave him
an advantage. Now, first of all,

24
00:01:13,961 --> 00:01:17,230
there's no fucking way that's true
because he doesn't have muscles, muscles.

25
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:20,570
Conversely, food into does give you
an advantage. I mean to do things.

26
00:01:20,571 --> 00:01:24,820
So I think mechanically it does cause
their springs. They essentially,

27
00:01:24,821 --> 00:01:29,710
the way his leg works with those
things is you put, you've seen them,

28
00:01:29,711 --> 00:01:33,940
right? They don't even look remotely like
feet. I've seen any other cheesy things.

29
00:01:33,941 --> 00:01:38,220
Yeah. Yeah. It's a crazy like,
but dude, the SI's hooked but,

30
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:41,890
but hold on site, that's not an advantage
because how mechanics work, right?

31
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:44,430
Is that a spring you put energy in

32
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:46,630
and you get a little bit less energy out.
Right.

33
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:48,460
So cause that's the laws
of thermodynamics, right?

34
00:01:48,461 --> 00:01:49,570
You can't get more out than you put in,

35
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:53,680
except a muscle does give you more than
you put in because a muscle converts

36
00:01:53,681 --> 00:01:56,290
food into energy for a
brief period. Right. Um,

37
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:59,940
and so he does, he has sprint, he doesn't
have springs. Sorry. He has springs.

38
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:02,400
He doesn't have a machine in his leg.

39
00:02:02,401 --> 00:02:05,460
The way the rest of us do that
creates force out of food.

40
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:08,610
The question is whether or not
the lower half of his legs,

41
00:02:08,611 --> 00:02:12,630
which is what he's missing, could
make up for the, the advantage,

42
00:02:12,631 --> 00:02:15,210
the mechanical advantage of
the shape of those things,

43
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:20,180
which applies all sorts of really
unusual leverage when you're right,

44
00:02:20,181 --> 00:02:24,330
it's totally or not, I mean I
don't, I don't know if it's,

45
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:27,540
I mean I don't know if you took him
with full legs and took him with those

46
00:02:27,541 --> 00:02:29,010
things if they'd run
the same amount of time.

47
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:32,790
But the thing that we can run
fast as fuck with those things.

48
00:02:32,791 --> 00:02:35,430
You've seen those guys,
well he could write,

49
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:39,270
but where's all the other double
amputees who are like, you know,

50
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:42,390
common of track and field. How
many of them are trying to, I mean,

51
00:02:42,391 --> 00:02:45,600
the Para Olympics is huge. There's like
a ton of Paralympic athletes, you know,

52
00:02:45,601 --> 00:02:48,990
like I've been told that it
has an mechanical advantage
by someone who actually

53
00:02:48,991 --> 00:02:50,930
should know what they're talking about.
But I want to,

54
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:53,620
I would like to look it
up to those, um, legs.

55
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,580
[inaudible] I remember reading stuff

56
00:02:56,870 --> 00:03:00,040
the time from, you
know, uh, know exercise,

57
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:03,670
whatever, uh, athletic scientists forget
what it's called. Um, who said that?

58
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:07,960
Who said that it didn't, right? Yeah, but
so that's a debate that we could have.

59
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:12,250
Right. But the point that I was trying to
make was looking at that Olympics. God,

60
00:03:12,251 --> 00:03:15,610
that's a better event with that guy in
it. You know, I'm so happy he was in it.

61
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,513
Right?

62
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:21,190
Like if it does give you an
advantage comes in second place,

63
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:23,590
you know? Well, so,

64
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:27,250
so the point is when we make
the rules of a game, right,

65
00:03:27,251 --> 00:03:29,590
and this is the point of our episode
about Games, which is about the Olympics.

66
00:03:29,591 --> 00:03:31,870
Actually when we make the
rules of the game we are,

67
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:34,600
there's no such thing as a perfectly fair
competition that would be designed by

68
00:03:34,601 --> 00:03:36,810
God to be perfect and be
perfectly fair. Right, right.

69
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:41,860
We're always making choices about what
kind of competition we want to have and

70
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:45,730
who we want to allow into it and
what sort of outcome we want to have.

71
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,010
You know what I mean?
Just like in baseball,

72
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,900
too many home runs moved
them round up or down.

73
00:03:49,901 --> 00:03:52,210
You know how they changed the rules a
little bit because they want more homeruns

74
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:54,130
same thing with same thing
with track and field.

75
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:57,490
We changed the rules a little bit to allow
this person and not allow this person.

76
00:03:57,491 --> 00:03:59,470
Right. I think that when
we're talking about people,

77
00:03:59,471 --> 00:04:02,860
we should always try to include more
people, not less. We should, you know,

78
00:04:02,861 --> 00:04:03,880
like if and if hey,

79
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:06,420
if you're a double amputee and you can
get your way into the Olympics and you

80
00:04:06,421 --> 00:04:07,450
can make a plausible case,

81
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:10,150
I think we should try to entertain that
notion and we should try to find a way

82
00:04:10,151 --> 00:04:14,050
to get that guy in there. Right. As
far as trans athletes go, you know,

83
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:14,860
we could have,

84
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:17,710
we could sit here and talk for three
hours about like all the different ways

85
00:04:17,711 --> 00:04:20,020
that hormones might affect your body.
It might not affect your body.

86
00:04:20,021 --> 00:04:22,300
And I'm not an expert on that,
and I don't want to claim to be right.

87
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:27,660
But a sports with a
trans athletes who are,

88
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:33,010
uh, you know, competing with the, you
know, with their gender, right? That's,

89
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:36,040
uh, that is a sporting world that
I'm Morgan trusted in. Right?

90
00:04:36,041 --> 00:04:38,080
And I think we should find
a way to make that happen.

91
00:04:38,081 --> 00:04:42,310
I know it's gonna be really complicated,
complicated and messy, right? Um, and, uh,

92
00:04:42,311 --> 00:04:44,320
there's gonna be a lot of debate about
it and it's gonna make it's going to be

93
00:04:44,321 --> 00:04:47,170
uncomfortable. You know, there's gonna
be a lot of arguments, but, you know,

94
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,720
I hope that that's the world that
we've moved forward to. That's my,

95
00:04:49,721 --> 00:04:50,650
that's my point of view.

96
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:56,270
My point of view is that there's a
reason there's a distinction. Uh,

97
00:04:56,620 --> 00:05:00,400
there's a reason why we make the
distinction to have male athletics versus

98
00:05:00,401 --> 00:05:03,940
female athletics. The reason is
that males have a physiological,

99
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,380
physiological advantage over women. So
in most sports, most physical sports,

100
00:05:08,381 --> 00:05:10,840
we do not have males compete with females.

101
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:16,200
The question becomes when someone who
was male transitions and becomes female,

102
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:21,300
do those same physiological
advantages apply? And what,

103
00:05:21,301 --> 00:05:22,990
what are the, what is the evidence? Well,

104
00:05:22,991 --> 00:05:26,680
the evidence and competition seems to
be that it shows that it does apply,

105
00:05:26,681 --> 00:05:31,150
particularly in weightlifting,
rugby, mountain biking, power,

106
00:05:31,151 --> 00:05:35,170
heavy sports that are,
that favor larger people,

107
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:36,550
stronger bodies,

108
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:40,750
males that transitioned to females have
a significant advantage and they're

109
00:05:40,751 --> 00:05:41,920
breaking world records.

110
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:47,140
So if you're a woman and you're a natural
woman and you don't take any extra

111
00:05:47,141 --> 00:05:48,350
hormones or male hormones,

112
00:05:48,351 --> 00:05:51,220
you not taking steroids or any sort
of performance enhancing drugs,

113
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:54,700
you're doing your very best to compete
and you're at the top of the heap.

114
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:58,370
But then someone comes
along that was a man for 30

115
00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:01,760
years and decides that they're going
to be a woman and this has happened and

116
00:06:01,761 --> 00:06:05,690
literally transition a few months ago
and compete as a woman and destroys

117
00:06:05,691 --> 00:06:09,590
records and dominates you in that sport.
That's bullshit.

118
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:13,340
And that's not competing
on a level playing field.

119
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:18,260
That's a person who is biologically a
male and who was a male for 30 plus years

120
00:06:18,261 --> 00:06:21,410
of having testosterone run through their
body and effect their tendon strength

121
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:26,060
and affect the shape of their bones and
the mechanical advantages of the male

122
00:06:26,061 --> 00:06:27,500
hips versus the female hips.

123
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:32,480
And then they're competing with smaller
people who have been a woman their whole

124
00:06:32,481 --> 00:06:33,890
life. It's not fair. It's,

125
00:06:33,891 --> 00:06:38,891
it's is as much cheating as taking
steroids when the other person doesn't or

126
00:06:38,931 --> 00:06:41,690
taking performance enhancing drugs
when the other person doesn't.

127
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:45,020
Maybe even more so maybe in
more so because you also have,

128
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:49,940
there's a bunch of advantages in terms
of reaction time that males enjoy.

129
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:53,930
It's like it's some significant difference
in reaction time between males and

130
00:06:53,931 --> 00:06:58,400
even untrained males versus female
professional athletes. Well,

131
00:06:58,670 --> 00:07:02,560
uh, I disagree and I have,
what do you disagree about?
I've, I've already, well the,

132
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:06,370
my main point being the one that
I already made, right? That like,

133
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:10,600
I don't think that there is such a thing
as a perfectly level playing field.

134
00:07:10,601 --> 00:07:13,650
I think we decide what kind of
playing field we want to have. Sure.

135
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:17,130
The distinction where we
don't allow men to come

136
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,360
and women's divisions.

137
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:22,050
And I think that that distinction
may be breaking down a bit. Right?

138
00:07:22,051 --> 00:07:23,910
And I think it may be time to
break down that distinction.

139
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:27,170
The male should be able to compete in
the women's division of weightlift.

140
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:32,100
Uh, no, I don't necessarily. Um,
but can, if they transition, uh,

141
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:35,950
well first of all, uh, uh, the,

142
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:38,460
there's, there's a lot of
stuff to break down, right?

143
00:07:38,461 --> 00:07:41,250
And I'm not an expert on the subject,
right? So it's just sort of my,

144
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:44,190
off the top of my head.
Um, one thing is, you know,

145
00:07:44,191 --> 00:07:48,690
you're postulating a particular
person who decided to transition, uh,

146
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:52,140
at the age of 30. Right? And they were
very big and strong before, right?

147
00:07:52,141 --> 00:07:56,850
And they decide to transition. Now that is
a type of person that exists. Right? Um,

148
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,110
I think over the next certainly 30
years, we're going to see, you know,

149
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:05,430
now that people are starting to understand
that being trans is just a way that

150
00:08:05,431 --> 00:08:07,920
people are, right. They're just
people who are trans. You know,

151
00:08:07,921 --> 00:08:10,530
and this is something that we're
going to accept and support, right?

152
00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:15,540
You're seeing folks tra transition
much, much earlier age, you know, um,

153
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:20,610
uh, and, and so if someone is, if someone
is transitioning from the age of like,

154
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:25,350
you know, seven years old, right? Um, and,
uh, you know, working with those hormones,

155
00:08:25,351 --> 00:08:27,030
you know, from that age, right,

156
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:30,870
they're not going to have their bodies
situations can be very different than the

157
00:08:30,871 --> 00:08:33,750
one that you, that you
postulated. Right. Uh,

158
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:36,900
I also know from my trans
friends that the, uh,

159
00:08:36,930 --> 00:08:40,260
the effects that the hormones have on
your body are like really profound.

160
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:44,410
You know, like really, really
profound. Like we're not like, um, uh,

161
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:49,050
to a surprising degree. Right.
Uh, and so, uh, you know,

162
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:53,910
I have, look, if the question
is how does, you know,

163
00:08:53,911 --> 00:08:57,480
how does a person who taking hormones
at a, at a particular age, right,

164
00:08:57,481 --> 00:09:00,570
how does their body change and how's
that affect visa vi athletic performance?

165
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:02,980
I don't know. We're in such
new territory here, right?

166
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:03,960
Well,
we certainly are,

167
00:09:03,961 --> 00:09:07,830
and we particularly would just scratched
upon the idea of kids transitioning in

168
00:09:07,831 --> 00:09:09,180
a very early age.
I mean,

169
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:12,600
there's been more scientific evidence
that points that if kids don't do that,

170
00:09:12,601 --> 00:09:15,690
then when they wanted to be trans at
an early age, they just become gay men.

171
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:18,300
And that there's nothing
wrong with that either. Um,

172
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:23,330
there's no reason to give kids hormones
and there's no reason to decide before a

173
00:09:23,431 --> 00:09:27,240
person's frontal lobe is completely full,
completely fully developed,

174
00:09:27,241 --> 00:09:31,270
which doesn't even take place till like
25 people don't know who they are. You,

175
00:09:31,271 --> 00:09:33,810
yes, a seven year old you, you won't even,

176
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:36,990
people don't even give their seven year
old phones. You don't let them vote.

177
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:39,870
You're going to let them decide what
sex they're going to be for the rest of

178
00:09:39,871 --> 00:09:40,410
their lives.

179
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:44,000
The research that I've seen, and
again, I'm not an expert on this and,

180
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:47,600
and you know, I'd love to, this is
a conversation. This is something I,

181
00:09:47,601 --> 00:09:50,790
I'd love to talk about on our show
and I'd specifically love, you know,

182
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:55,320
this is before does the kind of topic
where I really want to make sure that I

183
00:09:55,321 --> 00:09:58,960
know the research and that,
um, you know, also speaking
to Trans folks, you know, um,

184
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:02,550
in, in this conversation. But so to
touch on just what I've, you know,

185
00:10:02,551 --> 00:10:04,980
my own experience and what I've,
the research I've seen,

186
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:09,450
the research I've seen is that
trans kids from a young age, uh,

187
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:12,350
they are incredibly consistent in their w,
you know,

188
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:16,980
when they're expressing their gender
identity, um, and, and that and that

189
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:20,830
human beings. Yeah, yeah.
But the, that's, that's fit.

190
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:23,830
I'm just narrative by saying they're
incredibly consistent. Billy,

191
00:10:23,831 --> 00:10:26,270
if you polled these people, like what
are you talking about? Like a, you,

192
00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:30,590
I mean that's, I, I look, I don't have
the research in front of me that I saw,

193
00:10:30,591 --> 00:10:34,370
so I can't like go into the details on it.
But like, yeah, it was, I mean, it was,

194
00:10:34,371 --> 00:10:34,880
you know,

195
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:38,870
it was a research that was surveying and
tracking like trans kids who declared

196
00:10:38,871 --> 00:10:43,220
their identity from a young age. Did it
change? The answer was, uh, generally no,

197
00:10:43,221 --> 00:10:47,570
it really didn't. Um, and, uh, you
know, I have a friend who has a,

198
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,790
who has a trans kid, um, don't know
the kids exact age, but you know,

199
00:10:50,791 --> 00:10:53,600
we're in the age range that
we're talking about and you know,

200
00:10:53,601 --> 00:10:55,460
he's explained that like, well, you know,

201
00:10:55,461 --> 00:11:00,110
my child from a very young age
consistently like said, I am a girl, like,

202
00:11:00,111 --> 00:11:03,170
and has never contradict themselves,
never changed their mind.

203
00:11:03,171 --> 00:11:06,500
And so the humane thing and the thing
that he felt was going to do as a parent

204
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:10,910
was to like, embrace that choice
on his child's part. Right. Um,

205
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:12,420
and yeah,
that's,

206
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:16,090
we embrace that choice
meaning hormone really.

207
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:20,320
I shouldn't even phrase it as a choice,
like, like embrace that identity. Um,

208
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:24,590
but it is a choice, right?
I mean, if I choosing to add
hormones to a child's body,

209
00:11:24,591 --> 00:11:25,420
that's a choice.

210
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:28,970
Uh, it's a multiple, the choice. It's,
it's the, it's the choice on the,

211
00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:33,790
on the part of the parent. Um, it's not
a choice in the, on the, on the, uh,

212
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:35,590
on the part of the child to like,

213
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:38,620
in the same way that being said with
it being gay isn't a choice. Yeah.

214
00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:41,660
That's who they are.
If they think that they're a girl,

215
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:45,440
why do you have to give them
hormones to make them more of a girl?

216
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:51,370
Uh, because uh, I'm sorry, can
you expand on the question?

217
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:54,190
Simple.
If you say

218
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:55,840
that the child thinks it's a girl,

219
00:11:55,930 --> 00:11:59,560
so you're going to give the child hormones
[inaudible] if the child thinks it's

220
00:11:59,561 --> 00:12:03,460
a girl, let it be a girl. Like you
don't have, why are you adding hormones?

221
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:07,990
If you're shooting hormones into the
child and you're affecting the child's

222
00:12:07,991 --> 00:12:10,810
development, you're saying that's not
a choice. That's nonsense. Of course.

223
00:12:10,811 --> 00:12:15,760
It's a choice. You're choosing to
chemically change this child's body.

224
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:20,140
He choosing to inject things into this
child's body on a regular basis that are

225
00:12:20,141 --> 00:12:24,720
going to radically affect the physical
development of their body. Yeah.

226
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:26,530
And you're saying that
this isn't a choice.

227
00:12:26,531 --> 00:12:28,720
What's definitely a choice to do that.
So,

228
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:32,910
so what Trans People Express,
um, and again, I'm not an expert.

229
00:12:32,911 --> 00:12:35,850
This is from me talking to my trans
friends and, and you know, uh,

230
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:38,230
seeing what other trans folks say.
Um,

231
00:12:38,370 --> 00:12:43,370
is that the experience of being
trans and not receiving hormones,

232
00:12:43,381 --> 00:12:46,470
right? And not, uh, having the
body that you identify with,

233
00:12:46,770 --> 00:12:51,510
the feeling of Dysphoria, right,
is, um, extremely like painful,

234
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:56,310
um, and is a condition unto itself,
right? Um, and, uh, the, the,

235
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:59,880
the feeling of not belonging with the body
that you have of that mismatch, right?

236
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:04,170
That seems to be in the
broad variety of humanity,

237
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:08,190
the way that some people are born,
right? Where their inner self, right.

238
00:13:08,191 --> 00:13:10,720
The self that they are,
they're like, I am a, you know,

239
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,480
they're not thinking they are a woman.
They're like,

240
00:13:12,481 --> 00:13:15,750
this is the person that I am doesn't
match the body that they have. Right.

241
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:19,930
And that gives them extreme distress.
Right? And that leads to, you know,

242
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:24,840
suicide that leads to, uh, you know,
uh, other damaging behaviors. Right.

243
00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:28,860
And the best treatment for that,

244
00:13:28,861 --> 00:13:33,510
that we know exists is
to, uh, you know, have,

245
00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:38,310
do gender confirmation
via a hormones. Um, and

246
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,670
that doesn't effect the suicide rate.

247
00:13:40,671 --> 00:13:42,740
The suicide rate for
Trans People's very high,

248
00:13:42,741 --> 00:13:46,880
postop and preop really doesn't get
affected by whether or not you treat them

249
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:51,110
well. The operation, you know, one of
the questions conception is why is that?

250
00:13:51,111 --> 00:13:54,620
Is that because they're not accepted
by society and we're not more loving?

251
00:13:54,890 --> 00:13:56,750
Could it be underlying issues that are,

252
00:13:56,810 --> 00:13:58,910
that are causing them to feel
this way in the first place?

253
00:13:58,911 --> 00:14:02,930
Like what is it we don't know? And I felt,
I'm sure it varies widely. Look, so I,

254
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:04,090
all I can do

255
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:09,030
is a defer to the experts that,
that I know about this, right.

256
00:14:09,031 --> 00:14:11,400
So, um, uh, you know, for instance,

257
00:14:11,401 --> 00:14:15,930
there's an author named Brynn
Tannehill who is a former, uh,

258
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:18,600
uh,
former military helicopter pilot.

259
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:21,600
I just interviewed her for my new
podcast that's coming out soon,

260
00:14:21,601 --> 00:14:22,650
called a factually,

261
00:14:22,651 --> 00:14:26,040
I'm doing it on Earwolf and it's like
a long form interview podcast. Um,

262
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:30,420
and so she's one of the people who's
affected by, uh, the, uh, Trump, uh,

263
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:33,300
uh, military ban on Trans
Service people, you know,

264
00:14:33,301 --> 00:14:37,020
so that's why you brought her around
because she's trans. Yeah. Um, and uh,

265
00:14:37,021 --> 00:14:40,290
she wrote a fantastic book
called everything you need
to know about trans that

266
00:14:40,291 --> 00:14:43,160
like she's a, she is now
a researcher, right. Um,

267
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:45,150
and she went into really
deep detail about like,

268
00:14:45,151 --> 00:14:48,840
here is all of the medical science here
is all of here's all the science about

269
00:14:48,841 --> 00:14:51,380
it. And so at this point in the
conversation, I would say, hey man,

270
00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:53,780
I just got to bone up on,
you know, on that part.

271
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:56,780
Cause I don't want to speak
to suicide rates. My entire

272
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,590
or concern is with children.

273
00:14:58,591 --> 00:15:03,591
My concern is not with young adults
deciding to take steps to confirm their

274
00:15:03,991 --> 00:15:06,180
gender identity,
who they feel they really are.

275
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:09,270
I'm all for you doing whatever you
want to do when you're an adult,

276
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:12,780
when your mind is formed.
But people change their mind.
They change their opinion,

277
00:15:12,781 --> 00:15:13,620
they changed their thoughts.

278
00:15:13,770 --> 00:15:16,170
There's nothing wrong with
just deciding to be a gay man.

279
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:19,800
There's nothing wrong with
your body, uh, you know,

280
00:15:19,801 --> 00:15:23,580
as you grow and mature and develop,
you growing out of these ideas,

281
00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:26,070
some wheel in some world
and the ones who won't,

282
00:15:26,071 --> 00:15:28,650
they always have the option to
do something later on in life.

283
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:32,910
But if you do something to hormonally
block a child very, very early on,

284
00:15:32,911 --> 00:15:34,140
there's no turning back from that.

285
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:36,800
Well let me say, let me say a
few things of that. First of all,

286
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:38,750
it's not wrong to be
concerned about children.

287
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:42,830
And there's a reason this is the most
intense part of this conversation and I

288
00:15:42,831 --> 00:15:45,860
think it's correct, right? Because we're
all very concerned about children. Right?

289
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:50,660
But I do want to say, first
of all, I don't think it's
correct that trans people,

290
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:52,820
if they don't receive hormones from an,
from a young age,

291
00:15:52,850 --> 00:15:56,270
they simply become gay men.
Because I know it happens very often.

292
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:57,860
I Know Trans People,

293
00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:00,690
cause it was a big article
that was written about that
recently where they were

294
00:16:00,691 --> 00:16:05,691
talking about whether or not
gender confirmation surgery
and hormone blockers on

295
00:16:06,061 --> 00:16:09,000
young children is ethical
because of this fact.

296
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,740
And this was what they were talking about,

297
00:16:10,741 --> 00:16:14,700
where people at one point in time wanted
to be trans and they listed several

298
00:16:14,701 --> 00:16:18,000
famous examples and then as they
became older, just decided to be gay,

299
00:16:18,001 --> 00:16:21,510
including women who wanted to be men
who just became gay women. And I think,

300
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:26,730
what's that girl's name that was in John
Wick? Ruby rose. She was one of those,

301
00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:30,180
she wants to be trans when she was
younger and now she's just a gay woman.

302
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:34,850
So look, I, I know, I know
quite a few, uh, trans folks.

303
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:39,500
Right? Um, and I have to be honest,
none of the ones that I know where,

304
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:42,740
I don't know any trans women personally
who are gay men up until they

305
00:16:42,741 --> 00:16:47,690
transitioned. Right. Um, I
know quite a few trans women
who are straight men. Right.

306
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:51,800
Um, or who, you know, lived their lives
as to presented as straight men. Right.

307
00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:56,840
And then transitioned. Right. Um,
as an order come lesbians. Uh,

308
00:16:57,530 --> 00:16:59,900
yeah, I mean that's, that's one
of the ways that people can be,

309
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:02,190
I really recommend that. Um, oh,

310
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:05,990
the other thing I was going to say is
that I do know also among the Trans folks

311
00:17:05,991 --> 00:17:08,090
that I know where the Trans
people who speak about this,

312
00:17:08,091 --> 00:17:12,710
that I've heard so many of them say,
I wish I had access.

313
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:17,000
I knew this about myself at a very
young age and I wish to God that I had,

314
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:21,260
that we had, I had had the ability to
receive these hormones at a young age.

315
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:24,110
My life would be so much better.
And I'm not gonna Argue with those folks.

316
00:17:24,111 --> 00:17:24,890
You know

317
00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:25,541
these folks either.

318
00:17:25,541 --> 00:17:28,720
But you have to address the fact that
there are people that have gone through

319
00:17:28,721 --> 00:17:31,510
transition surgery and said,
I wish to God that I never did this.

320
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:32,980
There's a lot of those people too.

321
00:17:32,981 --> 00:17:35,410
So if you're looking for anecdotal
evidence and you want to be objective,

322
00:17:35,411 --> 00:17:35,950
you kind of have,

323
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:39,130
I'm sure we can. I'm sure we
can find the anecdotes. Um,

324
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:42,390
I'm very curious and this is what
I'd go consult my friend, uh,

325
00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:47,090
or my recent interview subject Tana Hills,
uh, work on this to see how many, uh,

326
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:49,500
see how many are in each
group right now, which, which,

327
00:17:49,501 --> 00:17:51,210
which sets of these
folks are the outliers.

328
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:53,790
I think the folks that you're talking
about are probably the outliers,

329
00:17:53,791 --> 00:17:56,770
but I can't, you know,
uh, confirm that all sir

330
00:17:56,830 --> 00:17:58,450
juries have potential costs.
However,

331
00:17:58,451 --> 00:18:02,560
according to a Swedish study
of 324 patients, three 40,

332
00:18:02,561 --> 00:18:06,700
1% of whom were born female surgery was
associated with considerably higher risk

333
00:18:06,701 --> 00:18:07,780
for mortality,

334
00:18:07,781 --> 00:18:12,781
suicidal behavior and psychiatric
morbidity than the general population.

335
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:15,850
So that's people who got the surgery.

336
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:20,420
I am curious, wait, 3.4, 1% of them.

337
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:24,470
The devil of this is in the details,
right? Because how much is the,

338
00:18:24,471 --> 00:18:28,010
is the higher risk? What does it mean?
3.1% of those who were born female

339
00:18:28,570 --> 00:18:30,670
from were born female and the
other ones were born male.

340
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:32,950
The males that transition to
females is what it's saying.

341
00:18:32,951 --> 00:18:36,730
It's only saying a small percentage of
them were born female that transitioned

342
00:18:36,731 --> 00:18:40,300
to male, but the larger percentage
was males who transitioned to female.

343
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:44,320
And that the surgery that they received
was associated with considerably higher

344
00:18:44,321 --> 00:18:45,520
risks for mortality,

345
00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:50,380
suicidal behavior and psychiatric
morbidity than the general population.

346
00:18:50,410 --> 00:18:52,240
Sure.
That's not healing them.

347
00:18:52,810 --> 00:18:56,860
That's saying that having that surgery
is associated with higher risks of

348
00:18:56,861 --> 00:19:00,310
mortality, suicidal behavior
and psychiatric morbidity.

349
00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:02,340
But it also says above following surgery,

350
00:19:02,341 --> 00:19:06,060
patients report lower gender dysphoria
and improved sexual relationships right

351
00:19:06,061 --> 00:19:08,490
before they killed themselves.
Everything's awesome. Well,

352
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:11,130
this isn't saying that people
are killing themselves. You know,

353
00:19:11,131 --> 00:19:11,940
you're looking for,

354
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:16,940
you're looking for something that confirms
a previously established opinion and

355
00:19:17,641 --> 00:19:18,960
as are you, you know, I mean we're, we're,

356
00:19:18,961 --> 00:19:21,480
we're looking at this and just
look at the, we should be,

357
00:19:21,810 --> 00:19:25,590
we should always be careful of drawing
too much from, you know, a single study.

358
00:19:25,591 --> 00:19:29,940
I'm like, look at it widely.
Right. Um, but, uh, uh,

359
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:33,920
what was the point I was about to
make? Um, it flipped my head. Uh, I,

360
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:39,370
I'm sort of at the, Oh, here's
what it was. Um, surgery.
Another thing I know from,

361
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:42,410
from speaking with Trans
folks is that surgery is
overemphasized, right? And then,

362
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:47,040
and that, uh, surgery for those
folks is not the, you know,

363
00:19:47,041 --> 00:19:49,950
we as sort of straight says people tend
to put too much emphasis on like, oh,

364
00:19:49,951 --> 00:19:51,390
did you get the surgery
yet? Or not? You know,

365
00:19:51,391 --> 00:19:54,560
and really it's more about what are
you living as and what is, you know,

366
00:19:54,561 --> 00:19:58,560
what sort of set of hormones do you have?
Right. Um, but I, I would really, uh,

367
00:19:58,710 --> 00:20:02,820
one of the, I've sort of reached the
limit of like my facility with this topic.

368
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:06,960
I really want to shout out, um, uh,
videos made by a friend of mine.

369
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:09,540
Her videos are called a contra points.
Her name's Natalie when,

370
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:13,650
and she does these increase.
She's a former, a philosopher,
former philosophy phd,

371
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:18,940
and she does these incredibly funny videos
about, is not just about transitions,

372
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:22,590
about all types of things. Um, uh, she had
really great one about comedy recently.

373
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:27,420
Um, but she really breaks down like a lot
of these, a lot of misconceptions, right.

374
00:20:27,421 --> 00:20:29,820
And has really changed every time I watch.
One of her videos,

375
00:20:29,821 --> 00:20:33,000
I'm like learning new things and like new
ideas are like pop, pop, pop in my head,

376
00:20:33,030 --> 00:20:34,790
you know. Um, and I,

377
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:38,310
I think you should check them out and
you might enjoy talking to her on the,

378
00:20:38,311 --> 00:20:41,430
on the show. She's like a really
fascinating person. Contra points.

379
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:44,460
It's an incredibly complex subject.
You really had a really is

380
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:49,330
angel on the podcast before who
transitioned from female to male,

381
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:53,290
which is also a different and
interesting thing. Yeah. Um, you know,

382
00:20:53,291 --> 00:20:57,400
and he said that his whole life just
felt like he was a boy and he didn't

383
00:20:57,401 --> 00:21:00,240
understand why he didn't have a penis.
He didn't understand like the whole,

384
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:03,100
it didn't make sense. And then once
he transitioned to being a male,

385
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:07,090
then he felt complete. You
know, I don't deny that.

386
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:12,180
My entire concern is that you're making
decisions for children and that this is

387
00:21:12,371 --> 00:21:14,710
a completely new thing with
no historical precedent.

388
00:21:14,711 --> 00:21:15,760
We've never done this before.

389
00:21:15,761 --> 00:21:20,320
There's not like a history of hundreds
of years of hormone blocker blockers

390
00:21:20,321 --> 00:21:25,180
being used on young children and whether
or not that is healthy and promotes a

391
00:21:25,181 --> 00:21:29,290
positive life. I feel like if
a child thinks there are girl,

392
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:30,880
let them live as a girl,

393
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:35,560
but you don't have to hormonally
engage with their body with chemicals.

394
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:39,580
It just seems crazy. It
seems ill advised. It does.

395
00:21:39,581 --> 00:21:44,581
It seems like this movement of acceptance
and progressive thinking in in in many

396
00:21:46,001 --> 00:21:50,650
ways is a fantastic thing.
It's a fantastic movement.
But this seems to me to be,

397
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:51,370
uh,

398
00:21:51,370 --> 00:21:56,050
a leap and that you're making this leap
to confirm your ideology and to confirm

399
00:21:56,051 --> 00:22:00,090
that, you know, you're 100% cool with
trans people and you're 100% co and you,

400
00:22:00,091 --> 00:22:03,850
you're going to recognize this child is
trans, but you're doing something. You're,

401
00:22:03,851 --> 00:22:06,490
you're doing something to this child's
body that you can't turn around.

402
00:22:06,850 --> 00:22:11,850
And if this child decides at whatever
age we decide that you can make rational

403
00:22:11,981 --> 00:22:16,120
decisions to transition as trans,
let them fully develop first.

404
00:22:16,150 --> 00:22:19,260
Let them be a person.
Let them make these decisions.

405
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:23,860
If you want to identify as a woman,
you and you want to keep your penis,

406
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:26,290
that should be fine too.
There's nothing wrong with that.

407
00:22:26,291 --> 00:22:27,850
If you want to keep a functional penis,

408
00:22:27,970 --> 00:22:31,690
you want to identify as a woman and not
even take hormones. Who Cares? Do that,

409
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:32,410
do that.

410
00:22:32,410 --> 00:22:37,410
But when you're stepping in
to a developing baby that's
only been alive for six

411
00:22:37,811 --> 00:22:42,811
years and you're shooting chemicals into
its body to change the way it develops.

412
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:44,440
Show me the research.

413
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:49,860
Show me the decades of peer
reviewed studies on one of
the most important things

414
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:53,560
that we know of the development
of a human being. Well,

415
00:22:53,561 --> 00:22:57,820
you're going to hear more
hormonally interact with
their body and some sort of a

416
00:22:57,970 --> 00:23:02,860
random doctor Frankenstein sort of way,
like say, how much evidence do we know?

417
00:23:03,430 --> 00:23:06,220
What evidence do we have
that this is a a powerful,

418
00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:09,010
absolute like intelligent,

419
00:23:09,011 --> 00:23:12,130
smart way to handle a child's
life over the long term.

420
00:23:12,131 --> 00:23:15,850
Like when these kids grow to be 60 as
opposed to kids who don't get the the

421
00:23:15,851 --> 00:23:19,750
hormone shots when they're six, they,
these people are 15% more happy.

422
00:23:19,870 --> 00:23:20,830
There's nothing like that,

423
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:24,220
but yet people are jumping into it because
it seems like the thing to do because

424
00:23:24,221 --> 00:23:26,920
it seems like the tide of society
is moving in that direction.

425
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:31,550
Well, I, I don't jump into
it for that reason. Um,

426
00:23:31,670 --> 00:23:36,670
I do think that when we're talking about
an issue that affects those people,

427
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:41,810
right? The first thing we should do
is listen to those people, right?

428
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:44,750
So the children listen to the children
and listen to the adults, right?

429
00:23:44,751 --> 00:23:46,040
Who said used to be that child.

430
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:49,880
Okay. You know, but they are not that
child. And you know, to you said the look,

431
00:23:49,881 --> 00:23:53,960
everyone's different. So for them to
say, I was that child, that's nonsense.

432
00:23:54,230 --> 00:23:58,280
You were a similar child in a similar
situation. You are not that shadow.

433
00:23:58,281 --> 00:24:01,370
They're not literally, but they
don't know how that child is feeling.

434
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:04,070
They don't know how much that child is
being influenced by its environment.

435
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:07,100
They don't know how much their thoughts
and their expressions are being

436
00:24:07,101 --> 00:24:09,790
encouraged by their parents.
They don't know that child. Sure.

437
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:13,430
So my point is,
when we're taught,

438
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:15,110
when you and I are talking
about this right now,

439
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,380
we're speaking pretty
hypothetically, right? We're,

440
00:24:17,381 --> 00:24:19,640
we're talking about a child that is
not in the room that we don't have.

441
00:24:19,641 --> 00:24:21,260
We're talking about a fictional trial,
right?

442
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:24,830
So what we really care about are
the actual people, right? Um,

443
00:24:24,890 --> 00:24:29,690
and when we talk to the actual
trans folks, right. And,

444
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:34,580
uh, talk to, you know, say, Hey, what
do you think, you know, how do you feel?

445
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:38,030
And, uh, you know, include
them in that conversation.

446
00:24:38,031 --> 00:24:40,400
I think we have a different
conversation about it. You know,

447
00:24:40,401 --> 00:24:43,310
we do have an open conversation,
but we also have a different conversation.

448
00:24:43,311 --> 00:24:46,760
We talked to people that have regret from
transition surgery cause there's a lot

449
00:24:46,761 --> 00:24:49,930
of those. Sure. But we're not, we don't
have either of those folks in the room.

450
00:24:49,931 --> 00:24:53,120
Right. You know, we have to
acknowledge that they're real
as well. Yeah. I, I don't,

451
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,590
uh, I'm not, I'm not dismissing
that those people are real. Right.

452
00:24:55,610 --> 00:24:57,980
But when we say if you
talk to Trans folks,

453
00:24:57,981 --> 00:25:02,110
you get this impression that's
not necessarily true. Um, uh,

454
00:25:02,190 --> 00:25:06,380
Wa a wide range of impressions.
I wasn't just,

455
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:10,670
I wasn't talking about specifically
the impression that I wasn't saying we

456
00:25:10,671 --> 00:25:15,620
should reason from anecdotal evidence.
Right. I'm saying that, um, look,

457
00:25:15,650 --> 00:25:20,570
the last conversation I had
with a person about this was a,

458
00:25:20,930 --> 00:25:21,380
uh,

459
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:26,150
was a trans military veteran who is
a researcher who wrote a book on,

460
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,340
uh, on these issues. Right.

461
00:25:28,370 --> 00:25:32,920
Comprehensively looked at the research
and told me that the research shows, uh,

462
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:36,010
that the evidence that you're asking for,
um,

463
00:25:36,050 --> 00:25:37,970
exists maybe not on a 30 year timeline,

464
00:25:37,971 --> 00:25:40,280
but there have been studies of this and
here's what we know about them, right.

465
00:25:40,281 --> 00:25:43,400
About Children's. Um, uh,
yeah, I mean that's a,

466
00:25:43,401 --> 00:25:44,800
that is my understanding of the role.

467
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:47,000
I have not looked at the research
myself and you know, I don't have,

468
00:25:47,010 --> 00:25:50,570
not on this topic on my
shows, the positive benefits
of children transitioning.

469
00:25:50,571 --> 00:25:51,650
I don't think that exists.
Well,

470
00:25:51,651 --> 00:25:56,600
we can't solve that in this conversation
right here. Um, but, uh, so my point is,

471
00:25:56,630 --> 00:25:59,180
look, I'm not going to go out on a
limb and tell you more than I can.

472
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:02,120
I can say off the top of my head, right,
because I'm not an expert on the subject.

473
00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:04,970
Uh, this is something
that, you know, if I,

474
00:26:04,971 --> 00:26:07,160
if this were something we had done on
our show and I had doubt dive into the

475
00:26:07,161 --> 00:26:09,440
research more, I can tell
you more. I know it exists,

476
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:13,910
but I can tell you what I have been told
exists by people who have made it their

477
00:26:13,911 --> 00:26:18,080
business to know, you know.
Um, so, uh, so, you know,

478
00:26:18,081 --> 00:26:22,070
that would be my next step in the
conversation. Um, uh, but, you know,

479
00:26:22,071 --> 00:26:26,260
that's what I'm saying is,
uh, those are, you know,

480
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:31,010
including those folks in this conversation
is a really critical part of it for

481
00:26:31,011 --> 00:26:34,100
me. Um, so yeah. Uh,

482
00:26:34,350 --> 00:26:36,700
well it's a conversation in the
world needs to have for sure. Yeah.

483
00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:40,730
And I think it's one that we
will have and you know, again,

484
00:26:40,731 --> 00:26:45,240
just to bring it back to athletics,
right? Um, I think that the,

485
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:50,250
uh, undeniable existence
of trans, you know,

486
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:53,980
children to teenagers to adults,
right, who want to compete, right. Um,

487
00:26:53,990 --> 00:26:56,790
and who make a compelling case to is that,
that they should be able to compete,

488
00:26:56,791 --> 00:26:59,850
right. Um, is going to be something that
we're going to have to grapple with.

489
00:26:59,851 --> 00:27:04,350
You know, I think there's going to be easy
answers to it. Um, and now, yeah, I mean,

490
00:27:04,351 --> 00:27:05,190
I think the real,

491
00:27:05,470 --> 00:27:10,410
the legitimate solution as a Trans
League or a trans division to have a male

492
00:27:10,411 --> 00:27:13,740
division of female division of Trans
Division if you want to compete

493
00:27:13,741 --> 00:27:17,900
athletically. That's fair to me. That
makes sense. Well, I hope that there's,

494
00:27:17,910 --> 00:27:21,360
you know, like say with the, you've
got the Para Olympics, right?

495
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:24,930
And the Paralympics is really like, it's
divided. Why do you know how they do it?

496
00:27:24,931 --> 00:27:26,790
Where they do like all
the different levels for,

497
00:27:26,791 --> 00:27:29,670
you've got this much amputated or you're
this mobile and you can compete in this

498
00:27:29,671 --> 00:27:32,760
way. You know? And so that's really
great to make a way that, you know,

499
00:27:32,810 --> 00:27:36,240
those folks can compete on a level as a
playing field as we can be, get, you know,

500
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:40,200
given the manifold variations in human
bodies. Right. But the fact that I,

501
00:27:40,201 --> 00:27:42,500
Oscar Pistorius,
which by the way we should bring up again,

502
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:45,450
he killed his girlfriend,
which is a very weird part of the story.

503
00:27:45,570 --> 00:27:49,140
And he said he thought she was a
robber bazaar. Completely bizarre.

504
00:27:49,170 --> 00:27:52,410
But the fact that he was able to
compete in the Olympics, right,

505
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:55,530
not just in the Paralympics. I think
such a wonderful thing, you know.

506
00:27:55,680 --> 00:28:00,060
And so I would hope that whatever
organization we come up with, you know,

507
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:02,820
allows for the,
uh,

508
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:07,560
allows for humans and all their variations
to compete in the Maine League as

509
00:28:07,561 --> 00:28:10,680
well. Right. Honestly,
because as possible,

510
00:28:10,710 --> 00:28:14,520
they come up with bionic legs like
Steve Austin from the $6 million man.

511
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:16,771
There's some people out there,

512
00:28:16,771 --> 00:28:19,890
they'll cut their fucking legs
off to run faster and that's real.

513
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:23,280
There are people that want to win so bad
they would cut the bottom of their legs

514
00:28:23,281 --> 00:28:24,930
off to get bionic prosthesis.

515
00:28:25,410 --> 00:28:29,760
They wouldn't really for sure 100%
would, would you? No, I wouldn't,

516
00:28:29,910 --> 00:28:33,050
but I'm not crazy. Look this
people, I mean these are
hands just cause they, they,

517
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:34,440
they're,
they are a bit,

518
00:28:34,441 --> 00:28:37,230
do you know that people have that feeling
that they're supposed to be disabled?

519
00:28:37,450 --> 00:28:39,600
So they amputated? Yes. Their hands. Yes.

520
00:28:39,601 --> 00:28:41,370
There's people with all sorts
of psychological disorders,

521
00:28:41,371 --> 00:28:45,630
but the need to win is so
insanely strong in some people.

522
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:47,280
And if they found out that,
hey man,

523
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:49,470
well who gives a fuck about
your feet and your calves? Man,

524
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:51,450
they're going to look
just like feet and calves,

525
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,730
except they allow you
to run 45 miles an hour.

526
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:54,990
But I don't think people would do it.

527
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:58,380
Isn't that a little similar
to the argument when people
say, Oh, trans bathrooms,

528
00:28:58,410 --> 00:29:00,450
it's just so man are just
going to lie about it.

529
00:29:00,451 --> 00:29:02,880
So they can go in the bathroom and peep
at women and then when you actually

530
00:29:02,881 --> 00:29:04,500
expand that, right, and
you're like, hold on a second,

531
00:29:05,010 --> 00:29:09,810
you're telling me a dude is going to tell
the entire world I am. I'm not a man.

532
00:29:09,811 --> 00:29:11,850
I'm a woman. They're going to
start dressing differently.

533
00:29:11,851 --> 00:29:14,880
They're going to take hormones. They're
going to like live with the stigma, right?

534
00:29:15,030 --> 00:29:17,250
They're going to one of the
most stigmatized type of people.

535
00:29:17,251 --> 00:29:20,130
You can be in America today as a trans
person and they're going to live with

536
00:29:20,131 --> 00:29:20,551
that stigma.

537
00:29:20,551 --> 00:29:23,220
They're gonna change our whole lives
and they're gonna do all of that just so

538
00:29:23,221 --> 00:29:27,210
they can peep at women in the bathroom.
It doesn't make any sense.

539
00:29:27,211 --> 00:29:29,910
Highly Unlikely, and it doesn't
make any sense, but it also,

540
00:29:29,911 --> 00:29:32,220
that's not entirely what could happen.

541
00:29:32,730 --> 00:29:36,120
What also could happen is you could get
some creep who dresses up like a woman

542
00:29:36,121 --> 00:29:39,990
and goes to the mail to the women's
bathroom. You can get that. I mean,

543
00:29:39,991 --> 00:29:43,280
I'm all for trans. You can't
have it now. I'm all for it.

544
00:29:43,281 --> 00:29:47,230
But if you have a bathroom that allows
trans people and you get some creep who

545
00:29:47,231 --> 00:29:50,080
says, I'm just gonna pretend to be
trans. If you don't think that's real,

546
00:29:50,350 --> 00:29:53,230
then you're crazy. Of course
people do that. Of course there's,

547
00:29:53,231 --> 00:29:55,720
and people have been arrested.
No, no, no. There is.

548
00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:56,950
There's people who have been arrested,

549
00:29:56,951 --> 00:30:01,180
men who were sex offenders who dressed
up as women and went into the women's

550
00:30:01,181 --> 00:30:03,930
room and harassed women. There's
already been risks. This is,

551
00:30:03,970 --> 00:30:07,600
but it's not because at least they have
trans transplant. But here's the thing,

552
00:30:07,601 --> 00:30:08,710
they're not the trans people.

553
00:30:08,770 --> 00:30:12,750
The people that are taking advantage of
a loophole and their creeps and they,

554
00:30:12,751 --> 00:30:15,580
they probably wanted to go into
the female bathroom anyway,

555
00:30:15,581 --> 00:30:18,640
but they just couldn't do it before.
And now that there's trans exclusive,

556
00:30:18,670 --> 00:30:22,540
inclusive bathrooms,
some creeps have been arrested doing that.

557
00:30:22,541 --> 00:30:26,140
They're not trans people.
The real problem is the creeps.

558
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:28,690
The real problem is not the Trans
people using the women's room.

559
00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:30,280
They should of course be
able to use the women's room,

560
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:33,820
but the creeps can go like you
don't need a law for like it.

561
00:30:33,970 --> 00:30:36,370
So if they're not trans people,
right,

562
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:41,560
they are not supposed to be in the
bathroom right there for way trans people.

563
00:30:41,561 --> 00:30:42,820
And this is what people
were worried about,

564
00:30:42,821 --> 00:30:46,090
but so have arrested people doing that.
So they could also do that.

565
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:48,170
Even if it was not a gender inclusive.
Sure.

566
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:51,370
It would be breaking the rules of the
bathroom and exactly the same way,

567
00:30:51,490 --> 00:30:56,490
but everybody waking the bathroom man
in a dress versus them being trans.

568
00:30:57,280 --> 00:31:01,210
See if you see a trans person, oftentimes
tramps, people look very masculine.

569
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:03,370
There's no need. If you're just
going to pretend to be trans,

570
00:31:03,550 --> 00:31:06,460
there's no need to hide
what we have to ask address.

571
00:31:06,550 --> 00:31:11,550
All you have to ask ourselves is if
the hypothetical or if the extremely,

572
00:31:12,671 --> 00:31:15,010
extremely rare situation
that you're discussing,

573
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:19,810
right is so horrifying to us and such a,

574
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:20,470
uh,

575
00:31:20,470 --> 00:31:25,470
such a big problem that
it's worth disenfranchising
millions of people from the

576
00:31:26,051 --> 00:31:30,040
ability to simply go to the bathroom
when they need to. You know, if,

577
00:31:30,070 --> 00:31:34,330
if that extreme edge case
or hypothetical case, right,

578
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:39,600
are we really going to, uh, are
we really going to, you know, uh,

579
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:42,860
hurt all, all of these actual people
who actually exist in say, hey,

580
00:31:42,861 --> 00:31:46,240
I just need to Goddamn go to the
bathroom, you know, um, in a,

581
00:31:46,330 --> 00:31:51,160
in a place that is, uh, you
know, safe for me. Right. Um,

582
00:31:51,250 --> 00:31:54,140
and I don't think, I don't
think it is, you know, like we,

583
00:31:54,150 --> 00:31:58,190
we can talk about that one edge
case all day long. Don't know.

584
00:31:58,191 --> 00:31:59,980
But these are the days has
been more than one case.

585
00:31:59,981 --> 00:32:04,200
But I think here's the
question, what were, what,

586
00:32:04,201 --> 00:32:05,380
what are there more of,

587
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:09,400
are there more trans people or
they're more sexual predators?

588
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:13,480
100% more trans people than
sexual predators who are
specifically going to put

589
00:32:13,481 --> 00:32:18,481
on a dress and in order to go
into a bathroom specifically,

590
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:23,500
yeah, I 100%. There's more trans people,
like, like by a factor of a million.

591
00:32:23,810 --> 00:32:27,460
Why don't but affected million? I mean,
how many people are trans? Uh, what's the,

592
00:32:27,461 --> 00:32:30,820
what's the numbers on that?
You know, I don't know. But
I would, I would consult my,

593
00:32:30,821 --> 00:32:32,890
a consultant,
my friend Brian's book to find out,

594
00:32:32,891 --> 00:32:34,220
because I'm sure it's
in there because she,

595
00:32:34,330 --> 00:32:37,750
she wrote a book that breaks down all
these statistics called everything you

596
00:32:37,751 --> 00:32:40,010
need to know about train
mind of a subject. You

597
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:43,590
know, as soon as you start bringing this
shit up, people go crazy because it's, uh,

598
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:47,390
it's complicated and people, they dig
their heels in the ground on both sides,

599
00:32:47,810 --> 00:32:51,940
you know, and, you know, I tried
to have, um, you know, happy,

600
00:32:51,941 --> 00:32:52,970
we able to have a conversation about,

601
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:56,690
I try to have a conversation
that's based on, you know, what,

602
00:32:56,840 --> 00:33:01,150
I try not to say more than I than I
think I can say, uh, with, you know,

603
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:04,490
with surety. Um, and uh, you know,

604
00:33:04,491 --> 00:33:07,130
but my basic principle is,
man,

605
00:33:07,131 --> 00:33:10,820
I just want to defer to the humanity
of the people that I'm talking about.

606
00:33:10,850 --> 00:33:13,250
You know what I mean? And rather than
saying, oh, well, here's my idea,

607
00:33:13,251 --> 00:33:17,030
here's my concern. What about the
what, what if, uh, what if, uh,

608
00:33:17,031 --> 00:33:19,410
a space alien were to come down and do
x, Y, z. You know what I mean? Rather,

609
00:33:19,411 --> 00:33:22,250
rather than try to come up with thought
experiments about it, you know, it's like,

610
00:33:22,251 --> 00:33:25,640
hey, there's some people in America,
they're making a polite request.

611
00:33:25,641 --> 00:33:29,450
Can we use the bathroom? Please go
ahead. You know, that's, that's my,

612
00:33:29,451 --> 00:33:31,610
that's what I default to write.
Just killed the perverts.

613
00:33:31,670 --> 00:33:34,730
And if they kill the perverts
and you don't have any issues,

614
00:33:34,790 --> 00:33:39,250
I think there's a way with sports
again, right? I genuinely think, hey my,

615
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:41,030
my default is I understand his problem.

616
00:33:41,090 --> 00:33:44,090
I understand you're going to have female
athletes who, who are, who say, Hey,

617
00:33:44,091 --> 00:33:45,500
wait a second. Is this fair? Right.

618
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:49,250
I think we can go forward with
good faith and find a way.

619
00:33:49,251 --> 00:33:51,470
Let's find a model that works
for everybody. You know,

620
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:55,310
I think we can do it in
a way that respects the
humanity of the trans athletes

621
00:33:55,311 --> 00:33:58,830
and assist athletes. I think that
we can do that. Um, and that's that,

622
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:01,670
that that will always be my thing.
It's easy to say, as an outsider,

623
00:34:01,671 --> 00:34:02,840
if you're a female athletes,

624
00:34:02,841 --> 00:34:06,290
it's been forced to compete with trans
women who used to be men for most of

625
00:34:06,291 --> 00:34:06,711
their lives.

626
00:34:06,711 --> 00:34:09,830
I think you'd have a different opinion
because I think they have a distinct

627
00:34:09,831 --> 00:34:12,770
physiological advantage that's been
expressed many times. I mean it's,

628
00:34:12,771 --> 00:34:16,970
there's just a lot of records have
been broken by Trans women who are now

629
00:34:16,971 --> 00:34:20,540
weightlifters. And there's that
one who's the fucking dirt biker,

630
00:34:20,541 --> 00:34:25,541
who's was a professional
dirt bike professional writer
before as a man and then

631
00:34:26,571 --> 00:34:30,290
transitioned over to a woman. It's just
dominating these things. It's just,

632
00:34:30,830 --> 00:34:34,160
I don't necessarily think it's fair.
I think just like,

633
00:34:34,161 --> 00:34:36,260
it's not fair for a man
to compete as a woman.

634
00:34:36,290 --> 00:34:40,100
I don't think that all those disadvantages
or those advantages rather go away

635
00:34:40,310 --> 00:34:43,280
when you transition,
especially in a short time period.

636
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:44,450
I just don't think they do.

637
00:34:44,630 --> 00:34:46,340
And I don't think there's any
evidence that shows they do.

638
00:34:46,550 --> 00:34:50,090
There's a diminishing amount,
but how much so, and in fact,

639
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:55,490
there's a doctor, board
certified endocrinologist,
doctor Ramona crushed sick,

640
00:34:55,491 --> 00:34:58,310
I think is her name. We did a whole
article on this about fighters,

641
00:34:58,550 --> 00:35:00,590
about male fighters,
uh,

642
00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:04,790
transitioning to becoming female and
competing as female, which has happened.

643
00:35:05,030 --> 00:35:09,060
And they're saying that not only
does the estrogen therapy, uh,

644
00:35:09,290 --> 00:35:12,000
it actually preserves bone density done,

645
00:35:12,001 --> 00:35:15,700
doesn't just turn them into a woman
or turn them into female or the,

646
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:19,520
so their hormone profiles similar to
females but also preserves their masculine

647
00:35:19,521 --> 00:35:20,151
bone density.

648
00:35:20,151 --> 00:35:22,910
Because one of the reasons why women
lose bone density as they get older,

649
00:35:23,150 --> 00:35:24,200
there's a lack of estrogen.

650
00:35:24,201 --> 00:35:27,240
That's part of the reason why
osteoporosis kicks in well that they,

651
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:30,780
that stops it in its tracks when
you're, you're injecting, um,

652
00:35:30,830 --> 00:35:35,240
female hormones into a male's frame.
So they maintain this male bone density.

653
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:40,020
Now there's also arguments that African
American female bone density is on,

654
00:35:40,050 --> 00:35:44,940
in many cases, similar to a
white European male bone density.

655
00:35:45,450 --> 00:35:46,710
So that's the,
um,

656
00:35:46,770 --> 00:35:50,220
the argument about the outliers and
about whether or not it's a level playing

657
00:35:50,221 --> 00:35:51,230
field because it most certainly is.

658
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:55,980
Yeah. I mean, so that, that's where
I get back to the idea that look,

659
00:35:56,220 --> 00:36:00,450
could someone show that a athlete who,

660
00:36:00,690 --> 00:36:04,590
a Trans Athlete who wants to compete is
going to have a physiological advantage

661
00:36:04,591 --> 00:36:08,940
because of their history of transition.
Right. Could that be the case?

662
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:13,000
Sometimes. Probably so. You know, I'm not
gonna, I'm not gonna argue that. Let let,

663
00:36:13,010 --> 00:36:14,070
well let's,
how about this,

664
00:36:14,210 --> 00:36:16,770
cause I actually don't want to know
one way or the other because I have not

665
00:36:16,771 --> 00:36:19,340
looked at any research on that, so
I don't want to make any claim. Um,

666
00:36:19,370 --> 00:36:22,230
so let's just, let's just grant that
for the sake of this thought experiment.

667
00:36:22,231 --> 00:36:25,590
Right. Okay. Um, so that being said,

668
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:30,000
let's compare that against every
single other advantage that every other

669
00:36:30,001 --> 00:36:33,780
competitor could have. Socioeconomic
advantage, right? Country of origin. Um,

670
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:37,110
you know, whether or not they live in
Denver or if they live below sea level,

671
00:36:37,170 --> 00:36:41,250
you know, like all those
different things. Right. Um, do,

672
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:46,120
is it humane to draw a line around that
one on earned advantage, right. Uh,

673
00:36:46,210 --> 00:36:48,510
against all those other honor advantages,
you know,

674
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:53,720
is at what point does our fantasy of
having a level of having a true level

675
00:36:54,301 --> 00:36:57,810
playing field end up hurting people, you
know, end up, end up excluding people.

676
00:36:58,110 --> 00:37:00,710
And that's the conversation that I,
that I think we could have.
