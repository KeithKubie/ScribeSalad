00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:09.380
SPEAKER: Yeah, welcome.

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:14.400
We have Sunniva Sorby joining
us today for a talk at Google.

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:15.900
I'll tell you a
little bit about her

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.140
and then we'll get
to her amazing story.

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:25.380
In 1993, as part of a historic
four-woman expedition,

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.030
Sunniva skied 67 days
across Antarctica

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:32.299
covering over 700
miles in winds that

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:38.710
topped 50 miles per hour in
60 degree below zero weather.

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:46.340
She pulled-- she and the other
women pulled 200-pound sleds,

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:48.290
and they were actually
the first women's team

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:51.560
to reach the South Pole in
a human-powered expedition

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:56.410
without the aid of sled
dogs or motorized vehicles.

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:58.940
Since then, she has
returned to Antarctica

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:02.920
over 50 times, completed
expeditions on Kilimanjaro

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:04.840
and the Greenland ice sheet.

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:08.140
She started an adventure
travel company called Red Door

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:12.250
Adventures to blend her love
of sharing different cultures

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:16.610
and also to create opportunities
for women in business.

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:20.590
And through this company,
she's created numerous trips

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:23.520
to Kilimanjaro and Patagonia.

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.500
Currently, she's
the global director

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.550
at Polar Latitudes, which
is an expedition cruise

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:34.510
company that operates two
cruise ships in Antarctica.

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:38.620
And I actually heard
Sunniva's tale firsthand

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:42.040
at a gathering some
time ago, and I

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:47.190
was truly inspired by
her tale of adversity

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:51.110
these women overcame,
which included setbacks

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:54.800
due to gender bias in addition
to the challenging and harsh

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:56.690
conditions of Antarctica.

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:00.030
So I'm excited to hear
more about her story today.

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.267
Join us welcoming Sunniva.

00:02:01.267 --> 00:02:02.600
SUNNIVA SORBY: Thank you, James.

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:03.790
Wait, don't leave.

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:09.080
I, you know, every once in a
while you get to meet somebody

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.540
and you know they are salt
of the earth, really nice,

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:13.647
kind people, and that is you.

00:02:13.647 --> 00:02:15.230
And this is a little
something for you

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:16.351
and your family to enjoy.

00:02:16.351 --> 00:02:16.850
OK?

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:17.960
So thanks so much.

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:22.220
I really, I really appreciate
all the effort and energy

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:24.890
that went into me being here.

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:26.060
I'm Canadian, by the way.

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:28.650
I live up in Squamish
north of the border.

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.510
So if you ever want to come
visit, you're all welcome.

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:34.520
I'm very, very happy
to be here today.

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:36.690
And can you all hear
me in the back there?

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:37.190
Yep.

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:38.600
Good.

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:40.670
And I just want to
make sure that I

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:45.710
say hello to all of you that
are listening maybe or watching

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:47.070
somewhere else.

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:49.070
It's nice to have
you join me today.

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:51.980
I'm going to talk
about this expedition

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:55.370
not because I was part
of it, although I was.

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:58.250
I'm hoping that
through what I share,

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:01.070
you will feel like
the human potential

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:04.850
and the power of our
thoughts over anything

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:10.200
we choose to do in our life is
really the nugget, so to speak.

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.010
It's like that great
quote by Henry Ford,

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:15.560
"Whether you think you can or
you think you can't, you're

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:16.970
right."

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:18.050
Right?

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:21.874
So this expedition took
place in Antarctica.

00:03:21.874 --> 00:03:23.540
And I don't know, has
anyone been there?

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:24.860
I'm not going to
assume otherwise.

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:25.359
No.

00:03:25.359 --> 00:03:26.170
OK.

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:29.810
Sometimes a hand goes up in the
audience, so it's, you know,

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:31.130
it's random.

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:34.829
Antarctica is an
absolutely amazing place.

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:36.620
It's the only continent
in the world that's

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:38.870
not technically owned
by anyone, although it's

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:40.940
governed by the treaty.

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:43.880
It is the land of superlatives.

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:46.910
It's called the windiest,
highest, driest, loneliest

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:48.890
continent on the
face of the Earth,

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:51.320
and it is so because
it's so far away.

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:54.335
It takes you-- if you
were to fly from here,

00:03:54.335 --> 00:03:56.690
like Mountain View,
LA, let's say,

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:59.000
or San Jose is the
closest airport.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.481
You would fly to Buenos
Aires in Argentina,

00:04:02.481 --> 00:04:04.730
and then you would take
another three-hour flight down

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:08.660
to Ushuaia, and from there
you would get on a ship.

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:10.629
We run two ships
down in Antarctica.

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:12.170
And it would take
you almost two days

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:15.200
to cross this very,
you can see it here,

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:18.170
this narrow body of
water between Argentina

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:20.240
and the Antarctic Peninsula.

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:21.959
It's called the Drake Passage.

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:24.220
And you can see around
Antarctica there

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:26.420
is nothing to stop the wind.

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:30.140
It's the largest-- all of the
body of waters in the world

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:33.950
circulate around the circumpolar
current in Antarctica.

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:37.550
So it's a very remote
place, and it's

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:41.900
a place that is not easy to get
to, even by plane or by ship.

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:47.910
But it's accessible today,
absolutely, with everybody.

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:51.480
It is a place where unlike-- and
I've never witnessed the Great

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:53.000
Wildebeest Migration,
but I would

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.570
imagine that to be an
incredible event, surreal event

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:59.390
to bear witness to.

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:01.340
They say that the
Antarctic continent

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:03.110
from one year to
the next doubles

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:05.690
in size because of the sea ice.

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:08.090
And we all know that
salt water freezes

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:11.450
at a temperature lower
than fresh water, yes?

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:14.360
So when the pack ice
starts to freeze,

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:16.590
Antarctica doubles in size.

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:18.980
Now this slide is showing
you how large it is.

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:22.880
It's, from one tip to the
other side of the continent,

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:25.790
it's 3,400 miles.

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:27.330
It's huge.

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:29.330
And even daunting
to think of skiing

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:30.674
across the Antarctic continent.

00:05:30.674 --> 00:05:32.090
I mean, you can
read about it, you

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:34.700
can look at beautiful
pictures of the icebergs,

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:37.490
you can read the stories of
the early polar explorers,

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:39.920
but until you actually
go to Antarctica

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:42.470
and experience the
absolute beauty

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:45.320
through the light and
the ice and the magnitude

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:47.630
of this place, it
overwhelms you.

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:48.290
It really does.

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:53.240
So it's fair to say that
when I joined the expedition,

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:56.540
I read as much as I possibly
could about this place,

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:59.900
but it didn't prepare
me for the trip itself.

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:03.050
Of course, if we could take that
away from all of experiences,

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:04.790
none of us would travel, right?

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:06.890
That's the beauty of travel.

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:08.990
The South Pole is--

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:10.640
this is 90 degrees
south right here.

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:12.740
It's where the Earth
squeaks on its axis.

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:14.960
It's where all the lines
of latitude and longitude

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:16.160
converge.

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:18.350
And it's a surreal thing
to get to the South Pole

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:22.250
because you feel like, yes, it's
an incredible accomplishment

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:24.710
to get there, but you see
an actual South Pole Marker.

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:26.480
So you have to touch it, right?

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:27.370
You have to.

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:30.080
You don't lick that because
that's not a good thing.

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:33.230
It's like for those of us
who ski, not a good thing.

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:35.660
But when I got there and
saw the South Pole Marker--

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:37.760
it stands about this high--

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:39.554
there was a row of
South Pole Markers.

00:06:39.554 --> 00:06:40.970
It's a little
defeating, you know,

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:42.860
to see a whole row of
South Pole Markers.

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:45.830
And that is because the
ice sheet moves somewhere

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:49.210
between 3 and 30 feet a year.

00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:50.840
3 and 30 feet a year.

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:53.050
So if you were to build
a house-- don't do this--

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:54.716
if you were to build
a house down there,

00:06:54.716 --> 00:06:56.900
it would move every year.

00:06:56.900 --> 00:07:00.040
And eventually, it
would end up down

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:01.630
at the edge of the
Antarctic continent

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:05.320
where calving occurs,
where the glacier actually

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:06.790
starts to break off.

00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:10.390
And we know that climate change
is a very big deal down there.

00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:12.130
We're bearing witness
to changes in both

00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:13.630
the Arctic and the Antarctic.

00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:15.210
And it's very real down south.

00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:18.250
I see a lot of calving
when I'm driving a Zodiac.

00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:19.390
It's incredible.

00:07:19.390 --> 00:07:23.050
So just to fast forward a little
bit about early exploration

00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:27.400
because you know, 82 years
after the first team of men

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:30.580
reached the South Pole,
we did our expedition.

00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:32.830
In our life, that's
not a long time really.

00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:35.920
But it's amazing it
took 82 years for women

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:39.340
to even conceive of the idea
of going down to Antarctica.

00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:42.130
And I can tell you that we had
a lot of people look at us.

00:07:42.130 --> 00:07:46.150
I'm the tallest of the four of
us at 5' 6" or whatever I am,

00:07:46.150 --> 00:07:49.690
and the smallest was Anne
Dal Vera, she's 5' 2".

00:07:49.690 --> 00:07:53.120
So this is really a story not
about Sunniva Sorby or Anne Dal

00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:55.720
Vera or Ann Bancroft
or Sue Giller.

00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:58.900
This story about the
American Women's Expedition

00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:02.710
is really about the
power of belief.

00:08:02.710 --> 00:08:04.990
Not just individual,
but how important

00:08:04.990 --> 00:08:08.630
it is for us to support each
other in our efforts, you know?

00:08:08.630 --> 00:08:10.480
And the dreams start
when we're small.

00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:15.104
When I was 10 years old, I
dreamt of going to the moon.

00:08:15.104 --> 00:08:17.270
I don't know why, but I
dreamt of going to the moon.

00:08:17.270 --> 00:08:18.130
So what did I do?

00:08:18.130 --> 00:08:21.340
I wrote a letter to NASA, and
I got a nice form letter back

00:08:21.340 --> 00:08:23.300
saying, stay in school.

00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:24.430
So I did.

00:08:24.430 --> 00:08:26.540
And the important
part of that, for me,

00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:28.750
was that my dream
wasn't squashed.

00:08:28.750 --> 00:08:31.600
And I'll tell you that skiing
across the Antarctic continent

00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:33.580
and experiencing
the polar ice cap

00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:37.522
was very much like what I
imagined the moon to look like.

00:08:37.522 --> 00:08:38.980
So sometimes you
think you're going

00:08:38.980 --> 00:08:41.470
to walk through a red door
and that's that one dream,

00:08:41.470 --> 00:08:43.090
but sometimes it's blue.

00:08:43.090 --> 00:08:45.670
So we have to stay awake,
you know, for our ride

00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:49.510
and be open to the very
different ways things

00:08:49.510 --> 00:08:50.830
get presented to us.

00:08:50.830 --> 00:08:53.560
So here we are at the South
Pole, minus 76 degrees,

00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:55.660
and we pay tribute
to Amundsen, who

00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:56.950
reached the South Pole first.

00:08:56.950 --> 00:09:00.550
He was a Norwegian, and he was
very efficient in his logistics

00:09:00.550 --> 00:09:03.240
and planning, very
successful with sled dogs.

00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:07.390
Arrived there a full month
before the infamous Robert

00:09:07.390 --> 00:09:08.980
Falcon Scott expedition.

00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:11.230
Has anyone heard
of these stories?

00:09:11.230 --> 00:09:12.160
Yeah?

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:14.680
They're fascinating stories
because not only do they

00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:17.920
dig into the human spirit and
what we're capable of doing,

00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:20.230
but it's a story
about how, you know,

00:09:20.230 --> 00:09:22.990
Robert Scott, for example,
they get to the South Pole

00:09:22.990 --> 00:09:24.460
and they find a tent.

00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:27.220
And then they find a
Norwegian flag waving proudly

00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:28.450
in the wind.

00:09:28.450 --> 00:09:30.640
And there's a letter
inside for Scott.

00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:34.700
And then there's also a
letter for the King of Norway.

00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:38.110
So it was a bittersweet
thing for Scott's party

00:09:38.110 --> 00:09:40.810
to arrive at the
South Pole defeated.

00:09:40.810 --> 00:09:42.670
They didn't get there first.

00:09:42.670 --> 00:09:46.000
And they got there and they
were so badly frostbitten,

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.540
they were very, very
hungry, and they were just,

00:09:49.540 --> 00:09:54.010
quite frankly, their spirits
were completely squashed

00:09:54.010 --> 00:09:56.260
because of Amundsen
getting there before.

00:09:56.260 --> 00:10:02.020
So they made the trek from the
South Pole back to their base,

00:10:02.020 --> 00:10:04.840
past McMurdo where
the Ross Sea is,

00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:06.730
the other side of Antarctica.

00:10:06.730 --> 00:10:08.290
And they never made it.

00:10:08.290 --> 00:10:11.050
It's a very sad story
because the five of them--

00:10:11.050 --> 00:10:13.750
and you can see the sad
looks on their faces here--

00:10:13.750 --> 00:10:17.470
but the five of them didn't
know how close they were

00:10:17.470 --> 00:10:20.560
to a resupply of food and fuel.

00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:22.360
They died at 18 miles.

00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:25.420
And those of you who ride a
bike or we drive a car, 18 miles

00:10:25.420 --> 00:10:26.740
is nothing.

00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:31.210
But in the world of this, 18
miles is an absolute eternity.

00:10:31.210 --> 00:10:34.450
We skied between 10
and 14 miles every day.

00:10:34.450 --> 00:10:35.680
That was our day.

00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:38.230
So 18 miles for them,
they didn't know this,

00:10:38.230 --> 00:10:40.720
they didn't have GPSes, they
didn't use the same equipment

00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:42.020
that we have today.

00:10:42.020 --> 00:10:44.200
So that was an eternity.

00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:46.870
They were in their
tents, and it was

00:10:46.870 --> 00:10:49.480
all they could do actually
to just keep themselves warm.

00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:51.760
And one of the men,
trying to retain

00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:55.180
a certain sense of honor,
walks outside the tent,

00:10:55.180 --> 00:10:57.430
and he uses these words--

00:10:57.430 --> 00:11:01.210
I am going outside and
I shall be some time.

00:11:01.210 --> 00:11:02.890
And he walked and
he walked and he

00:11:02.890 --> 00:11:05.180
walked, never to be seen again.

00:11:05.180 --> 00:11:08.830
Another one of the party of
five fell into a crevasse,

00:11:08.830 --> 00:11:10.120
and they lost him.

00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:13.059
And the other three were
found frozen in their tents

00:11:13.059 --> 00:11:15.100
the following spring when
a search party came out

00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:16.150
to find them.

00:11:16.150 --> 00:11:19.720
And then Scott's last words with
his pen were, for God's sake,

00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:21.340
take care of our people.

00:11:21.340 --> 00:11:24.460
It's a story-- there's
been hugely debated,

00:11:24.460 --> 00:11:26.530
these particular two
various expeditions.

00:11:26.530 --> 00:11:27.560
They get compared a lot.

00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:29.440
The Norwegians were
far more efficient

00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:31.070
than the British team.

00:11:31.070 --> 00:11:33.670
But it's really a story of
what we're capable of doing

00:11:33.670 --> 00:11:38.980
and how planning is absolutely
essential to success, right?

00:11:38.980 --> 00:11:41.200
But nothing-- I mean,
you can plan and prepare

00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:42.850
all you want for
a trip like this,

00:11:42.850 --> 00:11:45.740
but then stuff
happens on the inside.

00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:47.260
And we all know
what that's like.

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:49.600
It's the experience
of it, right?

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:51.520
So here we are in Punta Arenas.

00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:54.160
We actually flew to
Punta Arenas, Chile.

00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:56.500
And I call this a
bad hair day in Punta

00:11:56.500 --> 00:11:59.410
because our hair is like, woo.

00:11:59.410 --> 00:12:01.320
It's always windy there.

00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:07.300
And we would leave Punta Arenas
and fly eight hours to a place

00:12:07.300 --> 00:12:09.460
at 80 degrees south-- hi--

00:12:09.460 --> 00:12:11.650
at 80 degrees south where
there was a base there.

00:12:11.650 --> 00:12:12.820
And that base would--

00:12:12.820 --> 00:12:16.240
we with board a Twin Otter and
fly from there to our start

00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:18.220
at the edge of the
Ronne Ice Shelf.

00:12:18.220 --> 00:12:21.520
We couldn't leave for two
full weeks from Punta Arenas

00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:26.140
because over the Transantarctic
Mountains there was a shadow,

00:12:26.140 --> 00:12:28.870
and the pilot needs to
leave early in the morning

00:12:28.870 --> 00:12:33.190
to be able to avoid the shadow
that this mountain range casts

00:12:33.190 --> 00:12:34.990
on the blue ice runway.

00:12:34.990 --> 00:12:36.490
Two weeks we waited.

00:12:36.490 --> 00:12:38.740
We all know what it's like
to be delayed with a flight

00:12:38.740 --> 00:12:40.156
or something like
that for an hour

00:12:40.156 --> 00:12:41.380
or maybe half a day or a day.

00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:43.570
It's kind of an inconvenience.

00:12:43.570 --> 00:12:46.120
Imagine being delayed two weeks.

00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:48.130
The worst part about
that was the anxiety

00:12:48.130 --> 00:12:49.260
that was building up.

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:54.655
And it was also bad for
us because you start to--

00:12:54.655 --> 00:12:55.840
we train.

00:12:55.840 --> 00:12:58.150
You know, we're training
really hard for these trips,

00:12:58.150 --> 00:12:59.620
and we're trying to eat
as much as possible.

00:12:59.620 --> 00:13:00.911
That was a good thing actually.

00:13:00.911 --> 00:13:03.222
We ate like crazy
for those two weeks.

00:13:03.222 --> 00:13:05.680
And we stayed, you know, tried
to stay in shape by running.

00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:09.010
And we also got to know
some of the other expedition

00:13:09.010 --> 00:13:10.480
members that were down there.

00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:15.340
There was a team from England,
and it was Sir Ranulph Fiennes

00:13:15.340 --> 00:13:16.210
and Mike Stroud.

00:13:16.210 --> 00:13:18.520
I don't know if any of you've
heard of that expedition.

00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:23.740
But they were going to
do a study on starvation.

00:13:23.740 --> 00:13:25.600
Doesn't that sound fun?

00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:27.910
They were going to
see how far can we

00:13:27.910 --> 00:13:30.720
go physically,
emotionally, mentally,

00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:33.700
spiritually, how far can
we go before we actually

00:13:33.700 --> 00:13:34.960
starve ourselves to death.

00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:37.510
They wanted to find out,
you know, that absolute edge

00:13:37.510 --> 00:13:39.910
of what's possible.

00:13:39.910 --> 00:13:40.660
And they did.

00:13:40.660 --> 00:13:44.470
They were actually, they were
taking muscle tissue samples

00:13:44.470 --> 00:13:46.870
from their thighs for
some of the study.

00:13:46.870 --> 00:13:48.447
And they were hailed as heroes.

00:13:48.447 --> 00:13:50.530
They were found-- they
looked more dead than alive

00:13:50.530 --> 00:13:51.571
when they were picked up.

00:13:51.571 --> 00:13:54.820
They were 10 days away
from being very successful.

00:13:54.820 --> 00:13:57.130
But they were on the
cover of "Time" magazine

00:13:57.130 --> 00:14:00.280
when they got back and
hailed as heroes for this.

00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:02.500
We, as a group of
four women-- you know,

00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:06.070
women had never tried this
before-- we were extremely

00:14:06.070 --> 00:14:10.090
careful about how we presented
what we were doing to the world

00:14:10.090 --> 00:14:12.790
because we wanted to
go as a team of four

00:14:12.790 --> 00:14:14.740
and come back as a team of four.

00:14:14.740 --> 00:14:17.500
We wanted to ski all the way
across the Antarctic continent

00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:21.010
from the edge of the Ronne Ice
Shelf, which you see there--

00:14:21.010 --> 00:14:25.150
and we got a nice letter from
Edith Ronne; that ice shelf is

00:14:25.150 --> 00:14:26.530
named after her--

00:14:26.530 --> 00:14:28.720
and we wanted to go
to the South Pole

00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:30.220
and then from
there go to McMurdo

00:14:30.220 --> 00:14:33.520
and catch the very last cruise
ship home, which was February

00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:35.260
14, Valentine's Day.

00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:37.030
Motivation, you know?

00:14:37.030 --> 00:14:39.430
Everything down there is a
little mathematical equation

00:14:39.430 --> 00:14:42.220
on how many miles you do
every day, how much food you

00:14:42.220 --> 00:14:44.680
bring every day, 2
pounds per person a day.

00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:48.610
6,000 to 7,000 calories
is what we ate a lot.

00:14:48.610 --> 00:14:50.230
And a large
percentage of our diet

00:14:50.230 --> 00:14:52.870
was actually fat
because we need to stay

00:14:52.870 --> 00:14:54.310
insulated from the cold.

00:14:54.310 --> 00:14:56.650
So our goal was
to ski all the way

00:14:56.650 --> 00:14:58.390
across the Antarctic continent.

00:14:58.390 --> 00:15:00.980
I'm not here to talk about that
because that didn't happen.

00:15:00.980 --> 00:15:02.837
We made it to the South Pole.

00:15:02.837 --> 00:15:05.170
The reason for that is losing
two weeks in the beginning

00:15:05.170 --> 00:15:10.030
to bad weather, and also,
I got very, very sick.

00:15:10.030 --> 00:15:13.060
I had bronchitis
for over 45 days.

00:15:13.060 --> 00:15:15.550
I had tendinitis in both feet.

00:15:15.550 --> 00:15:18.790
And I mean, I look
back on this trip

00:15:18.790 --> 00:15:21.430
and sometimes I'm not sure
how in the world I did it.

00:15:21.430 --> 00:15:24.370
I clearly was not alone,
if you know what I mean.

00:15:24.370 --> 00:15:26.011
So our mantra was,
four to the pole.

00:15:26.011 --> 00:15:28.510
When all these setbacks and all
these things were happening,

00:15:28.510 --> 00:15:31.150
it was, no, not two people
will go to the South Pole

00:15:31.150 --> 00:15:32.980
and call that a success.

00:15:32.980 --> 00:15:34.780
It will be the four of us.

00:15:34.780 --> 00:15:37.810
Our goal was to also
pull all of our weight.

00:15:37.810 --> 00:15:41.560
We had 200 pounds in a sled
that was about 6 feet long.

00:15:41.560 --> 00:15:44.830
And you look at me and we can
look at anybody and go, what?

00:15:44.830 --> 00:15:46.150
You've pulled a 200-pound sled?

00:15:46.150 --> 00:15:47.470
Or, you've skied down Mt.

00:15:47.470 --> 00:15:48.640
Rainier?

00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:50.110
You know?

00:15:50.110 --> 00:15:51.250
We're amazing people.

00:15:51.250 --> 00:15:53.890
We are amazing when we
put our minds to it.

00:15:53.890 --> 00:15:56.290
I'm not sure how
we did this uphill.

00:15:56.290 --> 00:15:59.170
We start at 3,000 feet and
we ski up to the South Pole,

00:15:59.170 --> 00:16:01.450
which is 9,300 feet.

00:16:01.450 --> 00:16:03.780
I can tell you that
momentum is everything.

00:16:03.780 --> 00:16:05.020
Do you know what I mean?

00:16:05.020 --> 00:16:06.730
You don't stop, you go.

00:16:06.730 --> 00:16:07.570
You do a little--

00:16:07.570 --> 00:16:10.930
one breath, one pole
plant, one tug of the sled,

00:16:10.930 --> 00:16:13.270
and then you've got the next
step, and you just repeat.

00:16:13.270 --> 00:16:15.820
You press repeat,
repeat, repeat.

00:16:15.820 --> 00:16:18.250
It's not like eating the big
steak at once or something.

00:16:18.250 --> 00:16:19.840
It's taking small bites.

00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:23.410
So you see heel
lifters on our skis.

00:16:23.410 --> 00:16:24.610
That was really important.

00:16:24.610 --> 00:16:26.410
So we were elevated
and we were always

00:16:26.410 --> 00:16:27.880
move-- we were
always like, leaning

00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:29.463
at a little bit of
an angle like that.

00:16:29.463 --> 00:16:32.262
So we could actually
pull the sled.

00:16:32.262 --> 00:16:33.220
It was very, very hard.

00:16:33.220 --> 00:16:36.460
And in there was everything
we needed, from food

00:16:36.460 --> 00:16:39.730
and white gas, fuel to cook.

00:16:39.730 --> 00:16:41.360
2 pounds per person per day.

00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:44.200
You look at one of those
bags and it was 32 pounds.

00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:48.890
So it would be, it would
be, excuse me, yeah,

00:16:48.890 --> 00:16:50.630
it would be 32
pounds in one bag.

00:16:50.630 --> 00:16:52.310
That's for two women
for eight days.

00:16:52.310 --> 00:16:55.770
And every eight days, we
rotated a new tent partner.

00:16:55.770 --> 00:16:58.120
Do you think that's
kind of important?

00:16:58.120 --> 00:17:00.550
Super important because
after eight days and you're

00:17:00.550 --> 00:17:03.700
in a tent with someone, you
know everything about them.

00:17:03.700 --> 00:17:05.219
You know way too
much about them.

00:17:05.219 --> 00:17:06.760
And you need a little
bit of a break.

00:17:06.760 --> 00:17:10.771
So it was a strategic
decision on our part.

00:17:10.771 --> 00:17:11.770
So we've got everything.

00:17:11.770 --> 00:17:15.010
We've got-- all the
food gets prepackaged.

00:17:15.010 --> 00:17:18.391
We had kids, we had so many
children follow our project,

00:17:18.391 --> 00:17:20.349
and they signed little
notes, and they put them

00:17:20.349 --> 00:17:21.970
in the food bag.

00:17:21.970 --> 00:17:24.609
So we never know what message we
were getting when we opened up

00:17:24.609 --> 00:17:26.800
a new bag, and just
the different ways

00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:28.420
that support came to us.

00:17:28.420 --> 00:17:30.490
Our project cost
a million dollars,

00:17:30.490 --> 00:17:32.440
which today is nothing.

00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:33.460
Well, maybe it is.

00:17:33.460 --> 00:17:35.360
It is, actually.

00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:37.840
But we didn't have
one corporate sponsor

00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:40.780
that signed on board to
our expedition, not one.

00:17:40.780 --> 00:17:44.590
I gave a presentation last
week and a guy said, you know,

00:17:44.590 --> 00:17:47.170
if you did this, if you
did this expedition today,

00:17:47.170 --> 00:17:49.360
you would all be millionaires.

00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:52.431
And I'm not a millionaire,
but I do feel very rich inside

00:17:52.431 --> 00:17:53.430
if you know what I mean.

00:17:53.430 --> 00:17:55.180
And I think that
counts for a lot.

00:17:55.180 --> 00:17:59.077
So a million dollar expedition,
not one corporate sponsor

00:17:59.077 --> 00:17:59.660
came on board.

00:17:59.660 --> 00:18:02.320
We had Nike and L'Oreal
that were thinking about it,

00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:03.610
but they didn't join.

00:18:03.610 --> 00:18:07.300
So we raised money from
people like yourselves.

00:18:07.300 --> 00:18:09.982
The average donation was $25.

00:18:09.982 --> 00:18:11.440
We had money-- we
had a dollar that

00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:13.648
was sent all the way from
Germany to the headquarters

00:18:13.648 --> 00:18:15.340
in Minnesota with
a note saying, this

00:18:15.340 --> 00:18:17.350
is the only American
money I have.

00:18:17.350 --> 00:18:18.200
But-- you know?

00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:21.010
But it was like, that
was so meaningful for us.

00:18:21.010 --> 00:18:24.010
So we raised $600,000 like that.

00:18:24.010 --> 00:18:28.090
Selling T-shirts, you
know, selling our souls,

00:18:28.090 --> 00:18:30.040
traveling around
doing presentations.

00:18:30.040 --> 00:18:33.040
And the extra $400,000 we
raised when we got back.

00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:35.410
And it took us five years
to raise that extra $400,000

00:18:35.410 --> 00:18:36.530
when we got back.

00:18:36.530 --> 00:18:40.060
So it's an incredible story
of just the power of people,

00:18:40.060 --> 00:18:41.140
you know?

00:18:41.140 --> 00:18:42.550
And you're, at
Google, you're all

00:18:42.550 --> 00:18:45.260
about connecting things and
people and the community,

00:18:45.260 --> 00:18:47.110
and I love what you
have going on here.

00:18:47.110 --> 00:18:49.270
It's absolutely incredible.

00:18:49.270 --> 00:18:51.610
And I think that
cohesiveness and, you know,

00:18:51.610 --> 00:18:54.190
being connected with
one another is so key.

00:18:54.190 --> 00:18:58.630
And for us, it really was
the fuel for our expedition.

00:18:58.630 --> 00:19:00.490
On one day-- and you
know, as four women,

00:19:00.490 --> 00:19:02.620
we all had our
cycles down there.

00:19:02.620 --> 00:19:06.310
And on-- actually,
after one month we

00:19:06.310 --> 00:19:07.520
were all timed together.

00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:09.970
That's kind of scary, four
women who were on their cycles

00:19:09.970 --> 00:19:10.678
at the same time.

00:19:10.678 --> 00:19:12.630
We were like cats, you know?

00:19:12.630 --> 00:19:14.960
It kind of-- it was
pretty interesting.

00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:18.220
But Ann Bancroft, who I was
tenting with at the time,

00:19:18.220 --> 00:19:19.550
wasn't feeling very well.

00:19:19.550 --> 00:19:22.630
And after a day of the
sled and the harness

00:19:22.630 --> 00:19:26.107
tugging at her stomach, it
was really, really hard.

00:19:26.107 --> 00:19:27.940
So I said, I'm going
to make dinner tonight.

00:19:27.940 --> 00:19:30.880
And we did rotate who would
cook breakfast and dinner.

00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:33.470
And I made her a meal and
it was macaroni and cheese.

00:19:33.470 --> 00:19:35.590
I mean, who goes wrong
with mac and cheese, right?

00:19:35.590 --> 00:19:36.530
So simple.

00:19:36.530 --> 00:19:37.690
You've got the-- we know.

00:19:37.690 --> 00:19:41.170
It's like butter, the noodles,
cheese powder, and some milk,

00:19:41.170 --> 00:19:41.710
right?

00:19:41.710 --> 00:19:42.751
Do you do it differently?

00:19:42.751 --> 00:19:44.110
No, it's so easy.

00:19:44.110 --> 00:19:47.830
So I grab-- I wasn't part of
the, you know, all of the bags

00:19:47.830 --> 00:19:52.900
that we had to put into
various 32-pound stuff sacks.

00:19:52.900 --> 00:19:55.930
So I grabbed what I thought
was the cheese powder

00:19:55.930 --> 00:19:58.510
and I mixed it in with the
macaroni and the butter,

00:19:58.510 --> 00:20:00.110
lots of butter, lots of butter.

00:20:00.110 --> 00:20:03.640
And Ann takes a bite of this and
kind of whips her head around

00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:07.104
and looks at me and she goes,
what did you put in here?

00:20:07.104 --> 00:20:08.770
And I'm looking at
her and I take a bite

00:20:08.770 --> 00:20:11.510
and I thought, wow,
this is really awful.

00:20:11.510 --> 00:20:12.640
This was awful.

00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:14.260
And I realized that
I mixed, instead

00:20:14.260 --> 00:20:17.110
of cheese powder, orange
drink with the macaroni

00:20:17.110 --> 00:20:18.110
and the butter.

00:20:18.110 --> 00:20:19.310
Don't do that at home, OK?

00:20:19.310 --> 00:20:20.470
It was so awful.

00:20:20.470 --> 00:20:22.240
And the worst part
for us is we had

00:20:22.240 --> 00:20:24.280
to eat every single
bit of it because that

00:20:24.280 --> 00:20:26.710
was our ration for the night.

00:20:26.710 --> 00:20:29.440
So you've got to be very
careful who you're tenting with

00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:32.150
and who's cooking, number one.

00:20:32.150 --> 00:20:33.670
Another goal that
we had in addition

00:20:33.670 --> 00:20:36.430
to pulling our own weight
was to communicate with kids.

00:20:36.430 --> 00:20:39.730
And it's not done the
same way today, of course.

00:20:39.730 --> 00:20:41.950
We had a 30-pound
military radio that we

00:20:41.950 --> 00:20:43.630
used on this expedition.

00:20:43.630 --> 00:20:44.550
That's heavy.

00:20:44.550 --> 00:20:46.330
30-pound military radio.

00:20:46.330 --> 00:20:49.240
We set up skis and ski
poles and hung a dipole

00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:51.355
across the skis
and the poles so we

00:20:51.355 --> 00:20:53.230
could communicate in
the direction of Patriot

00:20:53.230 --> 00:20:54.750
Hills, which was--

00:20:54.750 --> 00:20:56.650
there's a base
there still today.

00:20:56.650 --> 00:20:58.450
If you wanted to go
down to Antarctica

00:20:58.450 --> 00:21:01.060
and photograph the emperor
penguins or climb Mt.

00:21:01.060 --> 00:21:05.020
Vinson or ski to the South Pole,
you would go to Patriot Hills.

00:21:05.020 --> 00:21:06.610
It's 80 degrees south.

00:21:06.610 --> 00:21:08.770
And that's where we were
communicating every three

00:21:08.770 --> 00:21:09.970
nights at 7 o'clock.

00:21:09.970 --> 00:21:10.990
That was our sched time.

00:21:10.990 --> 00:21:12.520
Our call sign was AWE--

00:21:12.520 --> 00:21:15.160
alpha whiskey echo,
alpha whiskey echo.

00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:16.690
So we would call
into Patriot Hills

00:21:16.690 --> 00:21:19.240
and we would let them know
where we were, how we were,

00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:21.070
how our food was,
how our fuel was,

00:21:21.070 --> 00:21:22.665
and anything else to report out.

00:21:22.665 --> 00:21:24.330
It was all one way.

00:21:24.330 --> 00:21:27.670
Well, two way with them,
but pretty much one way.

00:21:27.670 --> 00:21:30.100
We had no communication
with the outside world.

00:21:30.100 --> 00:21:33.460
Doesn't that seem
absolutely foreign today?

00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:35.170
I mean, on a trip
today we would be

00:21:35.170 --> 00:21:38.380
able to take like a handheld
iridium satellite phone.

00:21:38.380 --> 00:21:40.210
We wouldn't-- and we could talk.

00:21:40.210 --> 00:21:43.060
We could say we could, we
could order pizza if we wanted

00:21:43.060 --> 00:21:46.161
to-- which I tried on Greenland,
but they didn't deliver

00:21:46.161 --> 00:21:46.660
Domino's.

00:21:46.660 --> 00:21:48.410
Say they deliver
anywhere, but they don't.

00:21:50.416 --> 00:21:51.790
I did that, and
I went and talked

00:21:51.790 --> 00:21:53.730
to the manager when I
came back to San Diego.

00:21:53.730 --> 00:21:54.970
But it's kind of funny.

00:21:54.970 --> 00:21:57.310
So communication for us
to the outside world,

00:21:57.310 --> 00:22:00.040
we had 100,000 kids
followed us with a map

00:22:00.040 --> 00:22:03.720
that National Geographic
donated, and pushpins on a map.

00:22:03.720 --> 00:22:05.200
There was no internet.

00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:07.510
This is 1992, '93.

00:22:07.510 --> 00:22:11.050
And I still, I mean, I really
do enjoy sharing this story

00:22:11.050 --> 00:22:14.432
because it's about the absolute
simplicity around how we

00:22:14.432 --> 00:22:15.640
can move around in the world.

00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:19.750
This expedition was maybe
too far ahead of its time,

00:22:19.750 --> 00:22:20.750
if you know what I mean.

00:22:20.750 --> 00:22:22.750
Maybe-- we were the first
to do it and the first

00:22:22.750 --> 00:22:24.970
to succeed arriving
at the South Pole,

00:22:24.970 --> 00:22:28.000
but I wonder in retrospect,
with the internet, what that

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:29.170
would have done to our trip.

00:22:29.170 --> 00:22:31.330
We had no way of
knowing how people were.

00:22:31.330 --> 00:22:34.450
And that was actually
sometimes disconcerting.

00:22:34.450 --> 00:22:37.660
We were also doing research
on our physical bodies

00:22:37.660 --> 00:22:39.970
because we had four very
different body types,

00:22:39.970 --> 00:22:41.950
and you know, how
far, how long does it

00:22:41.950 --> 00:22:44.320
take for you to get really
cold and start shivering.

00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:46.210
Shivering is a really
good thing, actually.

00:22:46.210 --> 00:22:47.980
It's our normal
response to the cold.

00:22:47.980 --> 00:22:49.896
But when you stop
shivering, that's dangerous.

00:22:49.896 --> 00:22:52.510
So when you get to that
point, you know, you

00:22:52.510 --> 00:22:54.400
start to become hypothermic.

00:22:54.400 --> 00:22:56.330
Very, very dangerous
place to be.

00:22:56.330 --> 00:22:58.360
So we-- somebody's
idea of a joke

00:22:58.360 --> 00:23:01.390
was to put a beach
chair in an ice chamber,

00:23:01.390 --> 00:23:05.530
like a room, that was 5
degrees, and electrodes

00:23:05.530 --> 00:23:08.020
all over our body to measure
our body temperature.

00:23:08.020 --> 00:23:09.820
And we'd had to try to--

00:23:09.820 --> 00:23:10.540
dexterity.

00:23:10.540 --> 00:23:12.430
You just stop
functioning in the cold.

00:23:12.430 --> 00:23:13.472
You all know that, right?

00:23:13.472 --> 00:23:15.055
Although you live
in a beautiful place

00:23:15.055 --> 00:23:16.570
and it's warm all
the time, I know

00:23:16.570 --> 00:23:18.670
you are out there doing
things in the cold, too.

00:23:18.670 --> 00:23:21.460
So just knowing all
of this beforehand

00:23:21.460 --> 00:23:23.770
is very helpful for us
in terms of food planning

00:23:23.770 --> 00:23:25.145
and what kind of
gear we're going

00:23:25.145 --> 00:23:26.800
to use on a trip like this.

00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:31.090
So I'm sharing this,
which is coined by a man

00:23:31.090 --> 00:23:32.590
by the name of Paul Petzoldt.

00:23:32.590 --> 00:23:34.990
He's the founder of NOLS, the
National Outdoor Leadership

00:23:34.990 --> 00:23:35.960
School.

00:23:35.960 --> 00:23:39.400
And he's coined-- he came up
with this expedition behavior.

00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:42.040
And I like this because
it's the kind of way

00:23:42.040 --> 00:23:45.130
of thinking that makes
sure that you absolutely

00:23:45.130 --> 00:23:47.620
take responsibility
and care of yourself,

00:23:47.620 --> 00:23:51.940
but then in doing that, you are
then able to have the group's

00:23:51.940 --> 00:23:52.835
care in mind.

00:23:52.835 --> 00:23:53.710
You know what I mean?

00:23:53.710 --> 00:23:55.240
So it's all about
the collective.

00:23:55.240 --> 00:23:57.040
I think if every
company operated

00:23:57.040 --> 00:24:00.085
with expedition behavior,
wouldn't we be all better off?

00:24:00.085 --> 00:24:03.190
I'm sure you do it here, but
this was an important thing

00:24:03.190 --> 00:24:06.550
for us on the expedition
to have or to adopt

00:24:06.550 --> 00:24:08.920
as sort of how we
treat one another,

00:24:08.920 --> 00:24:11.260
although it didn't
always happen.

00:24:11.260 --> 00:24:13.300
I am going to
share a video clip,

00:24:13.300 --> 00:24:16.780
and this clip is just me joining
the expedition because that's

00:24:16.780 --> 00:24:17.650
a story in itself.

00:24:17.650 --> 00:24:19.810
I had six months to prepare
for this expedition,

00:24:19.810 --> 00:24:21.760
unlike the others where
they had two or three

00:24:21.760 --> 00:24:23.410
years, or four years.

00:24:23.410 --> 00:24:26.230
So a little-- we'll roll
the video clip on this.

00:24:26.230 --> 00:24:26.730
Thanks.

00:24:32.504 --> 00:24:33.170
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:24:33.170 --> 00:24:36.980
- The newly-formed team trains
for two months in Greenland.

00:24:36.980 --> 00:24:39.320
The test is dramatic.

00:24:39.320 --> 00:24:42.760
Their camping stoves used
to heat food and melt snow

00:24:42.760 --> 00:24:44.810
don't work.

00:24:44.810 --> 00:24:49.980
A language barrier results in
delivery of the wrong fuel.

00:24:49.980 --> 00:24:52.430
While awaiting delivery
of the proper fuel,

00:24:52.430 --> 00:24:57.130
the team eats five days' worth
of rations without leaving.

00:24:57.130 --> 00:25:00.520
Once in route, they learn
to ski using parachutes

00:25:00.520 --> 00:25:05.610
and to survive when
snowstorms bury their tents.

00:25:05.610 --> 00:25:07.590
Ann develops frostbite.

00:25:07.590 --> 00:25:10.650
Sarah Harrison struggles
with intestinal problems

00:25:10.650 --> 00:25:14.470
as her weight
plummets to 90 pounds.

00:25:14.470 --> 00:25:16.420
Towards the end,
the women run out

00:25:16.420 --> 00:25:21.420
of food and resort to
eating their frozen garbage.

00:25:21.420 --> 00:25:25.350
Greenland is severe,
Antarctica even more so.

00:25:28.619 --> 00:25:33.660
- When we get across
Greenland, finally, and feeling

00:25:33.660 --> 00:25:38.880
very triumphant and feeling
very solid as a team,

00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:39.930
the four of us--

00:25:39.930 --> 00:25:42.440
and of course, this is
our dress rehearsal.

00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:45.260
This is the stepping
stone to Antarctica.

00:25:45.260 --> 00:25:51.610
And Sarah makes the decision
before we leave Greenland

00:25:51.610 --> 00:25:55.810
that she, in her words,
as I recall it, says,

00:25:55.810 --> 00:25:59.820
I don't have Antarctica
in me any longer.

00:25:59.820 --> 00:26:01.060
And I need to step aside.

00:26:05.260 --> 00:26:06.150
- And I am--

00:26:06.150 --> 00:26:08.100
at that time, had
obviously not entertained

00:26:08.100 --> 00:26:13.800
going across the Antarctic,
but the idea of something big

00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:16.260
was in my realm of thinking.

00:26:16.260 --> 00:26:18.780
- And Sunniva hadn't been
on a lot of expeditions,

00:26:18.780 --> 00:26:23.540
and Sunniva was younger than
the rest of us by a fair bit,

00:26:23.540 --> 00:26:25.620
at 30 years of age.

00:26:25.620 --> 00:26:31.356
And so that young, almost naive
spark was really captivating.

00:26:31.356 --> 00:26:33.100
- Supposed to talk?

00:26:33.100 --> 00:26:36.840
I had my own little wish,
and that was essentially

00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:39.260
to prove that I could do this.

00:26:39.260 --> 00:26:41.940
- Sunniva Sorby
is from San Diego.

00:26:41.940 --> 00:26:44.670
She has extensive
wilderness trek experience,

00:26:44.670 --> 00:26:48.090
although none on expeditions
that are four-months long.

00:26:48.090 --> 00:26:51.630
She has only six months to train
before departure, none of it

00:26:51.630 --> 00:26:52.980
on the ice.

00:26:52.980 --> 00:26:58.070
- She had a willingness to
try anything new about it

00:26:58.070 --> 00:27:01.590
and brought no preconceived
conceptions or misconceptions

00:27:01.590 --> 00:27:02.960
about what was going on.

00:27:02.960 --> 00:27:05.334
I mean, that was her strength,
and that was her weakness.

00:27:05.334 --> 00:27:08.010
- And yet, she had the
ability and the hunger

00:27:08.010 --> 00:27:10.770
to want to continue to learn.

00:27:10.770 --> 00:27:12.740
- This will be a hard
trip for me physically.

00:27:12.740 --> 00:27:15.600
I knew that it would be
hard for me mentally.

00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:18.720
But I knew that it wouldn't be
so hard that it would break me.

00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:21.476
- So she became our fourth.

00:27:21.476 --> 00:27:22.868
[END PLAYBACK]

00:27:22.868 --> 00:27:26.230
SUNNIVA SORBY: [LAUGHS]
I'll be honest, it broke me.

00:27:26.230 --> 00:27:29.980
It's funny, I often
get asked, how did

00:27:29.980 --> 00:27:31.150
you think you could do this?

00:27:31.150 --> 00:27:34.116
Because there's a little bit
of the ego at play, you know,

00:27:34.116 --> 00:27:35.740
when we make a decision
to do something

00:27:35.740 --> 00:27:37.450
we've never done before.

00:27:37.450 --> 00:27:39.290
It can be a very healthy thing.

00:27:39.290 --> 00:27:41.290
But then when you start
on a trip like this,

00:27:41.290 --> 00:27:45.040
you must check your
ego at the door.

00:27:45.040 --> 00:27:47.110
And it was the ultimate
hero's journey.

00:27:47.110 --> 00:27:49.630
I know Joseph Campbell, if any
of you read works from him,

00:27:49.630 --> 00:27:52.390
it's the ultimate hero's
journey to find yourself

00:27:52.390 --> 00:27:54.730
going all the way
around a circle

00:27:54.730 --> 00:27:58.000
and coming back home to
starting-- coming back

00:27:58.000 --> 00:27:59.710
to the place you
started from only

00:27:59.710 --> 00:28:02.380
to find yourself completely
changed by the experience.

00:28:02.380 --> 00:28:05.110
And this was the experience
that I had down there.

00:28:05.110 --> 00:28:06.710
It was very physical.

00:28:06.710 --> 00:28:09.400
I was the youngest of the
four of us on the team.

00:28:09.400 --> 00:28:12.700
But I like to say
that I had-- what

00:28:12.700 --> 00:28:15.430
I had going on for me was
that I knew that I absolutely

00:28:15.430 --> 00:28:16.490
would not give up.

00:28:16.490 --> 00:28:17.710
I would not quit.

00:28:17.710 --> 00:28:20.170
I'm Norwegian, after
all, and Norwegians are

00:28:20.170 --> 00:28:21.670
known to be a little stubborn.

00:28:21.670 --> 00:28:23.590
This can be a
positive trait, and it

00:28:23.590 --> 00:28:26.170
was, for the most part,
a very important trait

00:28:26.170 --> 00:28:28.060
for me to have on
the expedition.

00:28:28.060 --> 00:28:30.760
So we know that we're leaving
a world of comforts and knowns

00:28:30.760 --> 00:28:32.200
behind.

00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:33.720
Nothing growing
in the Antarctic--

00:28:33.720 --> 00:28:35.290
it's a frozen desert.

00:28:35.290 --> 00:28:37.450
There is nothing-- you
will see no wildlife

00:28:37.450 --> 00:28:40.450
in the actual interior of the
Antarctic continent, no running

00:28:40.450 --> 00:28:41.210
water.

00:28:41.210 --> 00:28:44.440
But you've got 70% of the
world's fresh water frozen

00:28:44.440 --> 00:28:47.482
in the ice sheet, which is one
to three-miles thick from one

00:28:47.482 --> 00:28:48.190
point to another.

00:28:48.190 --> 00:28:51.910
And we're skiing over at
1.3 miles thick of ice.

00:28:51.910 --> 00:28:54.010
It's just hard to wrap
your head around that.

00:28:54.010 --> 00:28:56.330
So and all the things
that you're familiar with,

00:28:56.330 --> 00:28:58.450
even people, even
roadsigns, none

00:28:58.450 --> 00:29:00.550
of that will be experienced
in the Antarctic.

00:29:00.550 --> 00:29:02.830
Instead, you're going
to a place where

00:29:02.830 --> 00:29:04.345
all the extremes are-- wind.

00:29:06.970 --> 00:29:09.960
It's 24 hours of sunlight
when we're going there, from--

00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:12.820
we left in November, and
we finished in January.

00:29:12.820 --> 00:29:15.940
So that far south,
there's 20-- there's

00:29:15.940 --> 00:29:19.220
one sunset and one
sunrise every year.

00:29:19.220 --> 00:29:21.440
Isn't that hard to imagine?

00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:24.400
And it's so powerful,
the sun is so powerful

00:29:24.400 --> 00:29:26.186
when it comes down at--

00:29:26.186 --> 00:29:29.920
when-- 100% of the rays come
down, 80% of the sun's rays

00:29:29.920 --> 00:29:32.630
are reflected back off
the Antarctic ice sheet,

00:29:32.630 --> 00:29:33.880
and that is kind of dangerous.

00:29:33.880 --> 00:29:35.630
Because when you're
skiing, and you're me,

00:29:35.630 --> 00:29:37.720
and you have bronchitis,
and you're just

00:29:37.720 --> 00:29:40.180
having so much
trouble breathing,

00:29:40.180 --> 00:29:44.410
I burnt the roof of my mouth
from skiing, from [BREATHES]

00:29:44.410 --> 00:29:45.130
this.

00:29:45.130 --> 00:29:46.519
It's so dangerous.

00:29:46.519 --> 00:29:49.060
It's the single-most dangerous
thing is the wind and the sun,

00:29:49.060 --> 00:29:50.350
actually, down there.

00:29:50.350 --> 00:29:52.030
So with six months
of preparation--

00:29:52.030 --> 00:29:54.130
I was living in San
Diego at the time--

00:29:54.130 --> 00:29:56.740
what do you do to take
care of yourself and train?

00:29:56.740 --> 00:29:59.050
Well, there's not much I
could do above and beyond what

00:29:59.050 --> 00:30:00.675
I was already training
for, which was--

00:30:00.675 --> 00:30:02.500
I ran quite a few marathons.

00:30:02.500 --> 00:30:04.720
So I would put
rocks in a backpack,

00:30:04.720 --> 00:30:07.300
and I would pull three
tires off my Subaru

00:30:07.300 --> 00:30:08.560
with chain link around it.

00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:11.020
And I would have
a backpack, and I

00:30:11.020 --> 00:30:14.350
would have the rope connect here
with carabiners, the same way

00:30:14.350 --> 00:30:16.280
my sled would be attached.

00:30:16.280 --> 00:30:19.440
And I would just pull
those tires across the dirt

00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:23.705
and with rocks and a heavy load
mostly to train physically.

00:30:23.705 --> 00:30:25.330
But I think the most
important thing is

00:30:25.330 --> 00:30:26.770
what's happening to your mind.

00:30:26.770 --> 00:30:30.440
You get bored really quickly
doing something like this.

00:30:30.440 --> 00:30:31.640
So I remember this guy--

00:30:31.640 --> 00:30:33.400
this is in Penasquitos Canyon.

00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:35.780
He came up to me, and
he's on his mountain bike.

00:30:35.780 --> 00:30:37.690
And he comes sliding
in like this,

00:30:37.690 --> 00:30:40.148
and [MAKES BRAKING NOISE] you
know, a little dust comes up.

00:30:40.148 --> 00:30:41.770
And he says, hey,
lady, those tires

00:30:41.770 --> 00:30:43.465
roll a lot better
up on their end.

00:30:43.465 --> 00:30:44.590
I'm like, thanks, you know.

00:30:44.590 --> 00:30:47.232
[LAUGHS] So we put up
with all sorts of things

00:30:47.232 --> 00:30:48.940
when we're getting
ready for these trips,

00:30:48.940 --> 00:30:53.150
because they're so far away
from our normal, everyday life.

00:30:53.150 --> 00:30:57.280
And you start asking yourself
questions like, who am I?

00:30:57.280 --> 00:31:01.450
Where did I-- why is this
something that I am consumed

00:31:01.450 --> 00:31:03.820
by as something I'd like to do?

00:31:03.820 --> 00:31:06.130
It just takes over your
entire physical being,

00:31:06.130 --> 00:31:09.520
where you're in that state of
flow, if you know what I mean.

00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:11.680
And I started
looking at my family

00:31:11.680 --> 00:31:14.047
and looking at, poring
over old pictures,

00:31:14.047 --> 00:31:16.630
and trying to understand, am I
really different from my sister

00:31:16.630 --> 00:31:17.463
and my two brothers?

00:31:17.463 --> 00:31:18.490
And what are the--

00:31:18.490 --> 00:31:19.720
all of these questions.

00:31:19.720 --> 00:31:21.560
And I find this
photo of my mother.

00:31:21.560 --> 00:31:24.130
My father was a captain
on an oil tanker,

00:31:24.130 --> 00:31:26.350
and my mother was a
wireless operator on a ship.

00:31:26.350 --> 00:31:27.940
And I found this photo of me.

00:31:27.940 --> 00:31:29.700
Guess what I'm
holding-- a suitcase.

00:31:29.700 --> 00:31:31.530
Of course, I've had
a life of travel.

00:31:31.530 --> 00:31:33.760
And next to me is my sister
holding a little baby,

00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:35.530
and she's the one with the son.

00:31:35.530 --> 00:31:37.554
So I'm like, oh
boy, OK, if you want

00:31:37.554 --> 00:31:39.220
to know how you're
going to end up, just

00:31:39.220 --> 00:31:40.390
look at some early photos.

00:31:40.390 --> 00:31:43.131
And I also found a photo of
my great-grandmother pulling

00:31:43.131 --> 00:31:43.630
something.

00:31:43.630 --> 00:31:46.600
I thought, OK, that's
definitely running in my family,

00:31:46.600 --> 00:31:48.460
because pulling a
sled is not something

00:31:48.460 --> 00:31:49.990
that you'd normally do, right?

00:31:49.990 --> 00:31:51.420
So here we are in Punta Arenas.

00:31:51.420 --> 00:31:53.920
We fly over the
Transantarctic Mountain range.

00:31:53.920 --> 00:31:57.910
Finally after two weeks, we
land there on a blue ice runway.

00:31:57.910 --> 00:32:00.460
This was the scariest
part of starting the trip.

00:32:00.460 --> 00:32:02.590
It's a suncup blue ice runway.

00:32:02.590 --> 00:32:03.550
The plane comes down.

00:32:03.550 --> 00:32:04.750
It was a DC-9.

00:32:04.750 --> 00:32:06.670
And it has to whip
around 180 degrees

00:32:06.670 --> 00:32:08.740
to slow down to come back.

00:32:08.740 --> 00:32:12.070
And I remember Bruce, the
pilot, his wife was on board,

00:32:12.070 --> 00:32:14.740
and she was so, so special.

00:32:14.740 --> 00:32:17.770
She made a point of putting
her hand on my shoulder.

00:32:17.770 --> 00:32:19.645
And she just said
to me, she goes,

00:32:19.645 --> 00:32:22.670
Sunniva when you
get off the plane

00:32:22.670 --> 00:32:25.970
and you put your first
step on the continent, just

00:32:25.970 --> 00:32:27.440
stand there for a second.

00:32:27.440 --> 00:32:28.874
Just let the place take you.

00:32:28.874 --> 00:32:31.040
And that was a really,
really powerful thing for her

00:32:31.040 --> 00:32:33.320
to share, because
we're all stressed.

00:32:33.320 --> 00:32:35.070
We've lost two weeks
to bad weather.

00:32:35.070 --> 00:32:37.130
Our cheese has gone moldy.

00:32:37.130 --> 00:32:39.920
We've got five guys standing
at the South Pole arm in arm--

00:32:39.920 --> 00:32:42.980
they're literally standing
there smoking cigarettes--

00:32:42.980 --> 00:32:45.590
and looking at the four of
us coming off the plane.

00:32:45.590 --> 00:32:50.340
And they said, let us know
when you want to get picked up.

00:32:50.340 --> 00:32:51.690
Thank you.

00:32:51.690 --> 00:32:53.040
Right?

00:32:53.040 --> 00:32:55.290
From the get-go, the--

00:32:55.290 --> 00:32:58.699
people had trouble wrapping
their minds around the fact

00:32:58.699 --> 00:33:00.240
that women were
going to do something

00:33:00.240 --> 00:33:04.770
in a, up until that point, a
male-dominated environment.

00:33:04.770 --> 00:33:06.537
And to look at us,
we're not-- you

00:33:06.537 --> 00:33:08.370
know, no disrespect to
anybody from Russia--

00:33:08.370 --> 00:33:11.220
but we didn't look like
the Russians shot-putters.

00:33:11.220 --> 00:33:12.480
We weren't big and burly.

00:33:12.480 --> 00:33:15.180
We were normal women
with fires in our belly

00:33:15.180 --> 00:33:18.270
and a desire to do something
not just individually,

00:33:18.270 --> 00:33:19.890
but collectively,
and show people

00:33:19.890 --> 00:33:24.280
that as humans and as women,
regardless of your gender,

00:33:24.280 --> 00:33:27.690
your race, your size, any of
that, you put your mind to it,

00:33:27.690 --> 00:33:28.800
anything's possible.

00:33:28.800 --> 00:33:32.500
So we wanted to be those
conduits for that message

00:33:32.500 --> 00:33:34.530
in the world technically.

00:33:34.530 --> 00:33:36.125
So we started skiing.

00:33:36.125 --> 00:33:39.300
And we didn't take to heart
with those five guys shared.

00:33:39.300 --> 00:33:41.100
And we just start
skiing, one step

00:33:41.100 --> 00:33:42.900
at a time pulling our load.

00:33:42.900 --> 00:33:46.320
Unfortunately for us, we
had prevailing headwinds.

00:33:46.320 --> 00:33:48.900
That was a very unusual
wind year in Antarctica.

00:33:48.900 --> 00:33:51.120
Because we hoped to use sails.

00:33:51.120 --> 00:33:54.750
We had kites, and if you have
a tailwind, you're skiing.

00:33:54.750 --> 00:33:56.977
Your sleds behind you,
and you're on skis,

00:33:56.977 --> 00:33:58.560
and you're able to
use a kite and just

00:33:58.560 --> 00:33:59.910
sail across Antarctica.

00:33:59.910 --> 00:34:01.920
Doesn't that sound fun?

00:34:01.920 --> 00:34:04.680
And it sounded so
much fun to us too,

00:34:04.680 --> 00:34:07.950
but we, unfortunately, let 10
pounds of sails sat on our sled

00:34:07.950 --> 00:34:10.929
the whole trip because of
the headwind that was coming.

00:34:10.929 --> 00:34:14.610
So we didn't get to use that,
so we had to pull our load.

00:34:14.610 --> 00:34:16.949
And it was really a process of--

00:34:16.949 --> 00:34:19.550
we read all these books
about living in the moment.

00:34:19.550 --> 00:34:22.050
And it's hard to understand
what that is, because the second

00:34:22.050 --> 00:34:23.940
you do it, the moment's gone.

00:34:23.940 --> 00:34:24.440
You know?

00:34:24.440 --> 00:34:25.273
Have you been there?

00:34:25.273 --> 00:34:26.040
[LAUGHS]

00:34:26.040 --> 00:34:28.409
So I liken what I did
on this expedition

00:34:28.409 --> 00:34:31.050
to absolutely forcing
you to be in the moment,

00:34:31.050 --> 00:34:34.440
because if you obsess over where
you are and how big the trip is

00:34:34.440 --> 00:34:37.139
and what you're going to
do, you will be absolutely

00:34:37.139 --> 00:34:39.870
defeating yourself just
by your own thoughts.

00:34:39.870 --> 00:34:42.150
And those thoughts start to
permeate inside your body.

00:34:42.150 --> 00:34:44.370
And then all of a sudden,
it impacts your energy,

00:34:44.370 --> 00:34:46.719
and then you can't
make that next step.

00:34:46.719 --> 00:34:48.449
So it was really,
really important

00:34:48.449 --> 00:34:52.530
for us to think one step, one
pole plant, one step, one pole

00:34:52.530 --> 00:34:55.230
plant every single day.

00:34:55.230 --> 00:34:57.150
And this woman right
here, Sue Giller--

00:34:57.150 --> 00:34:58.350
I'm just going to
share a video clip

00:34:58.350 --> 00:35:00.600
in a second-- she was our
navigator on the expedition.

00:35:00.600 --> 00:35:02.100
We all had different roles.

00:35:02.100 --> 00:35:05.670
And her job was to keep us on a
straight path towards the South

00:35:05.670 --> 00:35:06.470
Pole.

00:35:06.470 --> 00:35:08.070
That sounds simple, right?

00:35:08.070 --> 00:35:10.170
We're in a place where
it's absolutely nothing

00:35:10.170 --> 00:35:13.200
but white around us,
but we have nothing--

00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:16.140
360 degrees-- nothing to
give us a point of reference

00:35:16.140 --> 00:35:18.540
for where we are, nothing.

00:35:18.540 --> 00:35:20.677
So we're relying on
our compass, which

00:35:20.677 --> 00:35:21.760
I'll show you in a second.

00:35:21.760 --> 00:35:25.759
But we're relying on a
GPS at night, which Sue--

00:35:25.759 --> 00:35:28.050
we always knew when she was
warming up the battery pack

00:35:28.050 --> 00:35:29.760
in here, because she screamed.

00:35:29.760 --> 00:35:31.440
And she'd warm up the batteries.

00:35:31.440 --> 00:35:33.000
And then we'd hold
up the GPS, so we

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:34.620
could latitude,
longitude, and get

00:35:34.620 --> 00:35:38.190
a fix for where we are and
then plot that on a map.

00:35:38.190 --> 00:35:41.766
So we would know what direction
of travel to take the next day.

00:35:41.766 --> 00:35:43.140
So I'll share a
little video clip

00:35:43.140 --> 00:35:46.604
of kind of what it was
like to tent with Sue.

00:35:46.604 --> 00:35:47.270
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:35:47.270 --> 00:35:51.400
- Because we had four
distinct personalities,

00:35:51.400 --> 00:35:53.100
it really shook things up.

00:35:53.100 --> 00:35:55.090
I mean, everybody
had a different sort

00:35:55.090 --> 00:36:00.220
of sense of humor, different
times when they would shine,

00:36:00.220 --> 00:36:02.830
different times when they
would be compassionate.

00:36:02.830 --> 00:36:05.330
Changes within the
group personality

00:36:05.330 --> 00:36:08.140
that happened naturally
with four different people

00:36:08.140 --> 00:36:10.960
make a huge difference
in your overall outlook

00:36:10.960 --> 00:36:13.630
of what you're doing.

00:36:13.630 --> 00:36:15.340
- So Anne, today is day number?

00:36:17.890 --> 00:36:18.610
- Four, I think.

00:36:18.610 --> 00:36:20.350
- [LAUGHS]

00:36:20.350 --> 00:36:23.590
- Yeah, it's day four, and we're
already doing mini repairs.

00:36:23.590 --> 00:36:25.100
- Isn't it day three?

00:36:25.100 --> 00:36:25.600
- Three?

00:36:25.600 --> 00:36:27.020
- You're one behind, Sorby.

00:36:27.020 --> 00:36:27.520
- Oh.

00:36:27.520 --> 00:36:29.560
- I'll have to show you
my other thing I did here.

00:36:29.560 --> 00:36:31.393
- Getting dropped off
the ice counts as one.

00:36:31.393 --> 00:36:33.880
- OK.

00:36:33.880 --> 00:36:37.940
- I got my hat so it fits
more snugly around my face.

00:36:37.940 --> 00:36:38.440
Three?

00:36:38.440 --> 00:36:39.320
- I'm on the cycle.

00:36:39.320 --> 00:36:40.570
This is one of those bad days.

00:36:40.570 --> 00:36:42.520
And Sunniva, who had
the least experience

00:36:42.520 --> 00:36:44.830
and was the youngest on
the trip says, well, it

00:36:44.830 --> 00:36:46.920
doesn't have to be that way.

00:36:46.920 --> 00:36:49.120
And I'm sitting there
going, she's right.

00:36:49.120 --> 00:36:51.360
You know, this is something
I have control over.

00:36:51.360 --> 00:36:54.010
I don't have to sit here
and say, geez, this sucks.

00:36:54.010 --> 00:36:55.810
It's one of my down days.

00:36:55.810 --> 00:36:58.000
I can throw this
away and let it go.

00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:00.760
In retrospect, I'm really
impressed that Sunniva was--

00:37:00.760 --> 00:37:03.730
had the insight to see
this, given her, in essence,

00:37:03.730 --> 00:37:06.270
lack of experience in this
sort of thing and her youth.

00:37:06.270 --> 00:37:07.030
[END PLAYBACK]

00:37:07.030 --> 00:37:09.640
SUNNIVA SORBY: I shared that
because I'm tenting with Sue.

00:37:09.640 --> 00:37:12.160
And she was-- we're two
introverts and two extroverts

00:37:12.160 --> 00:37:13.180
on the expedition.

00:37:13.180 --> 00:37:14.530
Can you guess what I am?

00:37:14.530 --> 00:37:18.910
[GIGGLES] And Sue was a
computer programmer at the time.

00:37:18.910 --> 00:37:21.190
And very literally,
I'm in the tent--

00:37:21.190 --> 00:37:23.830
this is the first tent
rotation, the first eight

00:37:23.830 --> 00:37:25.660
days on the expedition.

00:37:25.660 --> 00:37:28.061
And I am obsessed with
the end of the trip.

00:37:28.061 --> 00:37:29.560
Has that ever
happened to, where you

00:37:29.560 --> 00:37:31.390
start something and
all you can think about

00:37:31.390 --> 00:37:33.280
is the end of the
marathon where you

00:37:33.280 --> 00:37:35.770
get to have that cold beer
or something, you know?

00:37:35.770 --> 00:37:37.967
All I obsessed was with the end.

00:37:37.967 --> 00:37:39.550
And it was very,
very dangerous, and I

00:37:39.550 --> 00:37:41.091
didn't know how to
package it and how

00:37:41.091 --> 00:37:44.220
to actually, in my mind,
how to keep myself going.

00:37:44.220 --> 00:37:45.230
It was really scary.

00:37:45.230 --> 00:37:46.630
So I asked Sue.

00:37:46.630 --> 00:37:49.480
I said, how do you,
as a mountaineer

00:37:49.480 --> 00:37:52.420
and as a computer programmer,
how do you deal with your day

00:37:52.420 --> 00:37:54.037
to day to keep yourself going?

00:37:54.037 --> 00:37:55.870
And she whipped her
head around very quickly

00:37:55.870 --> 00:37:57.570
and she said, well it's easy.

00:37:57.570 --> 00:38:00.370
And I thought I was going to
have like the golden answer.

00:38:00.370 --> 00:38:03.550
And she goes, I have one good
day, and I have one bad day.

00:38:03.550 --> 00:38:05.452
And that's what she said.

00:38:05.452 --> 00:38:06.910
And I looked at
her, and I thought,

00:38:06.910 --> 00:38:09.220
that sounds
absolutely ridiculous.

00:38:09.220 --> 00:38:11.620
What if you have two
good days in a row?

00:38:11.620 --> 00:38:13.270
And she-- it was
very, very funny.

00:38:13.270 --> 00:38:15.353
She looks at me, and she
goes, well, you're right.

00:38:15.353 --> 00:38:17.420
I could actually have
two good days in a row.

00:38:17.420 --> 00:38:20.200
So it changed her way
of thinking on the trip.

00:38:20.200 --> 00:38:23.420
And she actually had a lot
more energy and kept going.

00:38:23.420 --> 00:38:26.020
It was really, really
an interesting thing.

00:38:26.020 --> 00:38:29.080
So I shared a little bit about
getting to the South Pole

00:38:29.080 --> 00:38:31.055
and how we navigate.

00:38:31.055 --> 00:38:32.680
If you're in a complete
whiteout, which

00:38:32.680 --> 00:38:35.770
we had quite a lot, this is
an amazing little contraption.

00:38:35.770 --> 00:38:39.670
This is how like unevolved
we were back then.

00:38:39.670 --> 00:38:41.369
This is a knee pad,
which you know,

00:38:41.369 --> 00:38:43.660
anybody who's doing any
masonry work or anything like--

00:38:43.660 --> 00:38:45.910
that's a knee pad;
an L-bracket--

00:38:45.910 --> 00:38:47.590
a friend of mine
made this for me;

00:38:47.590 --> 00:38:49.157
and I've got a
compass right here.

00:38:49.157 --> 00:38:51.490
And she created it so that
it had leather on the bottom,

00:38:51.490 --> 00:38:55.230
and I could slide it right
here on the L-bracket.

00:38:55.230 --> 00:38:56.080
Whoops.

00:38:56.080 --> 00:39:00.730
And this is what we had around
our waist the entire time.

00:39:00.730 --> 00:39:02.274
We would rotate
who is in the lead.

00:39:02.274 --> 00:39:04.690
Like, if I was leading, it
would be for an hour-and-a-half

00:39:04.690 --> 00:39:09.220
staring at the needle and
what direction I'm going at.

00:39:09.220 --> 00:39:11.260
And I'd have to keep
on a straight line,

00:39:11.260 --> 00:39:16.080
because one degree
of error is 60 miles.

00:39:16.080 --> 00:39:18.990
You're off course 60 miles,
that would be a really bad day.

00:39:18.990 --> 00:39:23.130
So this was our little lifeline
and super important for us

00:39:23.130 --> 00:39:24.870
to have that the whole way.

00:39:24.870 --> 00:39:28.680
So food, all of our systems,
our rotation and tents,

00:39:28.680 --> 00:39:31.800
putting up a snow wall that
took 45 minutes to build because

00:39:31.800 --> 00:39:34.650
of those prevailing headwinds--
everything that we did

00:39:34.650 --> 00:39:37.890
was pretty much systematic.

00:39:37.890 --> 00:39:42.000
So it was very hard to go out
of that routine for yourself

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:42.930
and help somebody.

00:39:42.930 --> 00:39:46.200
I know that sounds silly to say,
but you're in your own space.

00:39:46.200 --> 00:39:47.740
You're in your
own survival mode.

00:39:47.740 --> 00:39:50.730
And even though you want to help
your teammate, it's hard to do,

00:39:50.730 --> 00:39:52.410
because you're hunkered down.

00:39:52.410 --> 00:39:54.900
You're in that
spot of just trying

00:39:54.900 --> 00:39:56.610
to control your own thoughts.

00:39:56.610 --> 00:39:59.430
We share this slide for
the University of Minnesota

00:39:59.430 --> 00:40:01.680
who was doing a study
on communication.

00:40:01.680 --> 00:40:03.420
And we're like, not
much communication

00:40:03.420 --> 00:40:04.932
on the expedition for us.

00:40:04.932 --> 00:40:06.390
Because we're
sitting on our sleds.

00:40:06.390 --> 00:40:08.340
We take a 15-minute
break for lunch.

00:40:08.340 --> 00:40:11.460
And we're eating
toffee and GORP--

00:40:11.460 --> 00:40:12.720
good old raisins, peanuts--

00:40:12.720 --> 00:40:16.290
cheese sticks, anything that
has a high calorie content.

00:40:16.290 --> 00:40:17.600
And we're snacking all day.

00:40:17.600 --> 00:40:21.225
We're-- have a warm breakfast
and snacking all day long,

00:40:21.225 --> 00:40:22.350
every time we take a break.

00:40:22.350 --> 00:40:24.960
And then we've got a
warm meal at dinner.

00:40:24.960 --> 00:40:28.980
So it was eating cold food,
nothing really exciting,

00:40:28.980 --> 00:40:31.130
nothing like the
food that I saw--

00:40:31.130 --> 00:40:33.450
that I perused out here, hm-hm.

00:40:33.450 --> 00:40:37.360
So you're eating mostly
freeze-dried, dehydrated foods.

00:40:37.360 --> 00:40:41.100
And it's amounting to 6,000--
roughly 6,000 calories a person

00:40:41.100 --> 00:40:41.970
per day.

00:40:41.970 --> 00:40:43.120
It was a lot.

00:40:43.120 --> 00:40:46.950
And if you're me, I lost my
appetite about three weeks

00:40:46.950 --> 00:40:49.980
into the expedition,
because I was eating--

00:40:49.980 --> 00:40:52.630
I was in charge of first
aid and our research.

00:40:52.630 --> 00:40:54.840
And I was the one who was
in the first aid kit almost

00:40:54.840 --> 00:40:55.840
all the time.

00:40:55.840 --> 00:40:58.630
Because I had bronchitis.

00:40:58.630 --> 00:41:03.690
And I was using
ibuprofen for my ankles,

00:41:03.690 --> 00:41:05.610
which were extremely swollen.

00:41:05.610 --> 00:41:08.530
And I was having a
really, really hard time.

00:41:08.530 --> 00:41:11.910
And I had systemic edema
where my body was so swollen

00:41:11.910 --> 00:41:14.940
that my eyes were swollen shut
when I woke up in the morning.

00:41:14.940 --> 00:41:17.670
And I had a day-- and
it was December 24--

00:41:17.670 --> 00:41:21.750
where I put my ski poles up in
the air, and I crossed them.

00:41:21.750 --> 00:41:25.140
And when you do that, you're
telling your teammates,

00:41:25.140 --> 00:41:26.040
I'm done.

00:41:26.040 --> 00:41:27.510
I can't go on anymore.

00:41:27.510 --> 00:41:28.470
I stopped.

00:41:28.470 --> 00:41:32.140
And I stopped because
I was just so, so sick.

00:41:32.140 --> 00:41:36.060
And more than the physical
part that shut down,

00:41:36.060 --> 00:41:39.150
my spirit just was
crushed, squashed.

00:41:39.150 --> 00:41:41.010
And I had nothing
left to think about.

00:41:41.010 --> 00:41:45.180
I had nothing left to
actually keep me going.

00:41:45.180 --> 00:41:48.608
So I'll share a little
clip about that.

00:41:48.608 --> 00:41:51.860
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:41:51.860 --> 00:41:54.710
- During the trek,
AWE participates

00:41:54.710 --> 00:41:57.920
in an ongoing study for the
University of Minnesota.

00:41:57.920 --> 00:42:00.650
The topic-- the
psychological effects

00:42:00.650 --> 00:42:04.770
of stress, risk, and gender.

00:42:04.770 --> 00:42:06.280
- So there were
questions that we

00:42:06.280 --> 00:42:08.780
filled out every single night.

00:42:08.780 --> 00:42:11.570
And those questions
were something

00:42:11.570 --> 00:42:14.690
like, how did you cope today?

00:42:14.690 --> 00:42:17.360
And coping mechanisms
were like 1 to 10--

00:42:17.360 --> 00:42:20.250
praying, crying, writing.

00:42:20.250 --> 00:42:23.264
And how often do
you do this, Anne?

00:42:23.264 --> 00:42:28.108
- I to do this every night
generally before I go to bed.

00:42:28.108 --> 00:42:30.598
Probably takes five minutes.

00:42:30.598 --> 00:42:32.135
Takes Sue about two.

00:42:32.135 --> 00:42:33.440
[GIGGLES]

00:42:33.440 --> 00:42:37.936
- Can you read off just two
questions from there for me?

00:42:37.936 --> 00:42:40.220
- They're asking what
the exertion of the day

00:42:40.220 --> 00:42:46.510
was, and it goes from nothing at
all to maximal, which is a 10--

00:42:46.510 --> 00:42:49.400
very, very strong.

00:42:49.400 --> 00:42:53.610
Generally for me, I'm at
around the five or six range.

00:42:53.610 --> 00:42:55.593
- Do you like doing
the questionnaire?

00:42:55.593 --> 00:42:59.612
- I tend to get a bit irritable
about it in the evening,

00:42:59.612 --> 00:43:02.544
especially after a 12-hour day.

00:43:02.544 --> 00:43:04.460
- And that's usually
when you have to do it is

00:43:04.460 --> 00:43:06.376
in the evening, right,
after your 12-hour day?

00:43:06.376 --> 00:43:07.222
- Yup.

00:43:07.222 --> 00:43:08.780
It's after the day.

00:43:08.780 --> 00:43:10.850
- Is there a spot on
there for irritable?

00:43:10.850 --> 00:43:11.580
- There is.

00:43:11.580 --> 00:43:17.690
There's a spot for
irritable, hostile--

00:43:17.690 --> 00:43:21.210
sometimes it makes us
hostile [GIGGLES] to do this.

00:43:21.210 --> 00:43:23.670
- But I couldn't fight anymore.

00:43:23.670 --> 00:43:26.130
I couldn't keep being
obsessed with the pain

00:43:26.130 --> 00:43:29.170
and taking painkillers and
having the swelling go down.

00:43:29.170 --> 00:43:32.520
I didn't have any more
things to draw from.

00:43:32.520 --> 00:43:36.060
And so I let myself cry.

00:43:36.060 --> 00:43:38.742
I just sobbed horribly.

00:43:38.742 --> 00:43:40.200
And what's nice
out there is you've

00:43:40.200 --> 00:43:42.960
got these big glasses
on, and nobody can really

00:43:42.960 --> 00:43:44.010
see if you're crying.

00:43:44.010 --> 00:43:47.450
So I did it with the-- in
the comfort of the Antarctic.

00:43:49.852 --> 00:43:51.310
- You must never
let yourself think

00:43:51.310 --> 00:43:54.680
of that big distance, the
enormous distance ahead and all

00:43:54.680 --> 00:43:58.010
the pain which lies ahead,
because you might not be

00:43:58.010 --> 00:44:00.080
able to cope with big thoughts.

00:44:00.080 --> 00:44:02.600
So you just think of
the next 10 minutes.

00:44:02.600 --> 00:44:06.260
- There were times when I
prayed for guidance of decisions

00:44:06.260 --> 00:44:08.490
when we were making
big decisions

00:44:08.490 --> 00:44:11.240
and when I was making
big decisions, guidance

00:44:11.240 --> 00:44:18.505
in how to motivate the gang.

00:44:18.505 --> 00:44:19.430
[END PLAYBACK]

00:44:19.430 --> 00:44:21.264
SUNNIVA SORBY: That was
Sir Ranulph Fiennes.

00:44:21.264 --> 00:44:22.846
I told you about the
two men that were

00:44:22.846 --> 00:44:24.030
doing the starvations study.

00:44:24.030 --> 00:44:26.030
He was one of the two.

00:44:26.030 --> 00:44:29.810
So we are now four days
away from the South Pole.

00:44:29.810 --> 00:44:34.430
And we are-- Ann is in the lead,
and she's navigating with the--

00:44:34.430 --> 00:44:36.830
my friend made one for her too.

00:44:36.830 --> 00:44:39.080
She's navigating
off of what she sees

00:44:39.080 --> 00:44:42.470
in the distance as something
that's in her straight line.

00:44:42.470 --> 00:44:45.410
The problem was that this
particular thing was moving.

00:44:45.410 --> 00:44:49.190
And if you're in a plane
and you're flying above us,

00:44:49.190 --> 00:44:51.410
this is what we look
like from the air--

00:44:51.410 --> 00:44:54.080
the four of us, our two
tents, and our four sleds.

00:44:54.080 --> 00:44:57.210
We only got this photo when we
came back from the expedition.

00:44:57.210 --> 00:44:59.810
And does that not
look like the moon?

00:44:59.810 --> 00:45:01.910
I think that is just what
I would imagine the moon

00:45:01.910 --> 00:45:02.820
to look like.

00:45:02.820 --> 00:45:06.020
So Ann was navigating off
of a moving object, which

00:45:06.020 --> 00:45:10.130
was a C-130 Hercules that came
from McMurdo to the South Pole,

00:45:10.130 --> 00:45:12.110
and they heard that
the women were coming.

00:45:12.110 --> 00:45:13.850
So they came from
the South Pole.

00:45:13.850 --> 00:45:16.630
They flew over us,
and they did this--

00:45:16.630 --> 00:45:17.420
tipped the wing.

00:45:17.420 --> 00:45:18.530
And we're standing there.

00:45:18.530 --> 00:45:20.150
I mean, we have
gone two months not

00:45:20.150 --> 00:45:21.860
seeing a soul, not-- nothing.

00:45:21.860 --> 00:45:25.040
We've gone so far away
inside, so deep inside.

00:45:25.040 --> 00:45:27.226
And I'm really still
very, very sick.

00:45:27.226 --> 00:45:29.600
And I stand there-- we all
stand there with our ski poles

00:45:29.600 --> 00:45:31.099
under our armpits,
and we're looking

00:45:31.099 --> 00:45:35.640
at this plane going, wow.

00:45:35.640 --> 00:45:37.567
Like, movement-- there's
movement in the sky.

00:45:37.567 --> 00:45:38.400
And there's a plane.

00:45:38.400 --> 00:45:39.566
And do they know we're here?

00:45:39.566 --> 00:45:42.697
And all these questions--
and then all of a sudden,

00:45:42.697 --> 00:45:45.030
there's a chute-- there's a
technical name for the chute

00:45:45.030 --> 00:45:46.260
in the back of the plane--

00:45:46.260 --> 00:45:47.490
out comes a box.

00:45:47.490 --> 00:45:51.400
[MAKES DESCENDING NOISE] Lands
about 150 feet away from us.

00:45:51.400 --> 00:45:53.820
So we send our best
skier, Anne Dal Vera,

00:45:53.820 --> 00:45:55.870
to go and get the box.

00:45:55.870 --> 00:45:57.780
And she comes, and
we rip it open.

00:45:57.780 --> 00:45:58.860
It's got Priority Post--

00:45:58.860 --> 00:46:01.140
US Priority Post-- love this--

00:46:01.140 --> 00:46:02.230
and duct tape.

00:46:02.230 --> 00:46:04.996
And there's a letter
in there from 16 people

00:46:04.996 --> 00:46:06.120
that are onboard the plane.

00:46:06.120 --> 00:46:08.620
And it says, to the
Antarctic explorers,

00:46:08.620 --> 00:46:10.740
we have been tracking
you every day.

00:46:10.740 --> 00:46:14.070
They knew what our radio sched
time was and our frequency.

00:46:14.070 --> 00:46:15.480
And they listened in.

00:46:15.480 --> 00:46:18.549
They knew that we had
frostbite, tendinitis.

00:46:18.549 --> 00:46:20.340
They knew that I was
so sick, and they knew

00:46:20.340 --> 00:46:22.620
that we ran out of chocolate.

00:46:22.620 --> 00:46:24.600
And so they said,
congratulations

00:46:24.600 --> 00:46:25.770
on reaching the South Pole.

00:46:25.770 --> 00:46:27.330
We'll see you when
you get there.

00:46:27.330 --> 00:46:29.740
And inside were cheddar
cheese goldfish--

00:46:29.740 --> 00:46:31.200
I love those things--

00:46:31.200 --> 00:46:34.516
crossword puzzles, comic
strips, all the things

00:46:34.516 --> 00:46:36.390
that you might need to
keep yourself a little

00:46:36.390 --> 00:46:38.600
entertained out there,
and then lots of food.

00:46:38.600 --> 00:46:40.710
There was homemade
chocolate chip cookies.

00:46:40.710 --> 00:46:43.200
And the thing after
two months of doing

00:46:43.200 --> 00:46:44.820
this and the four
of us overcoming

00:46:44.820 --> 00:46:48.390
all sorts of obstacles both
from people who didn't believe

00:46:48.390 --> 00:46:52.530
that we could do it, all
the biases and hurdles

00:46:52.530 --> 00:46:55.740
you can imagine, we're standing
there, and we're weeping.

00:46:55.740 --> 00:46:57.270
The four of us are
around the box,

00:46:57.270 --> 00:46:59.370
and we're weeping at
the sight of a red

00:46:59.370 --> 00:47:01.650
rose which was in the box.

00:47:01.650 --> 00:47:04.170
And it was beautiful, and
it smelled like a rose.

00:47:04.170 --> 00:47:07.290
And it was the only
external smell or thing

00:47:07.290 --> 00:47:10.440
that we had to remind us
that we-- emotionally, we

00:47:10.440 --> 00:47:11.737
were still alive.

00:47:11.737 --> 00:47:13.320
And I think that's
an important thing,

00:47:13.320 --> 00:47:16.710
because we do these trips to
learn things about ourselves,

00:47:16.710 --> 00:47:21.180
yes, and to actually find that
ultimate human experience where

00:47:21.180 --> 00:47:24.510
we're in that state of flow
and-- even through hardship.

00:47:24.510 --> 00:47:27.960
And so I had a really strong
purpose on this expedition.

00:47:27.960 --> 00:47:29.040
And I share this--

00:47:29.040 --> 00:47:31.890
I love Victor Frankl's book,
"Man's Search for Meaning"--

00:47:31.890 --> 00:47:34.860
really great read, because
essentially, I think all of us

00:47:34.860 --> 00:47:36.720
are looking to be happy in life.

00:47:36.720 --> 00:47:38.410
It's been written about so much.

00:47:38.410 --> 00:47:40.680
And I think happiness
comes from us having

00:47:40.680 --> 00:47:43.110
that optimal human experience.

00:47:43.110 --> 00:47:44.730
And for me, it's
when I'm engaged

00:47:44.730 --> 00:47:47.400
in something physical that
has a meaning to it that's

00:47:47.400 --> 00:47:50.340
far bigger than me,
which was the expedition.

00:47:50.340 --> 00:47:51.510
We came back from the trip.

00:47:51.510 --> 00:47:54.830
We arrived at the South
Pole January 14, 1993.

00:47:54.830 --> 00:47:58.110
I'll end with a short little
video clip in a second.

00:47:58.110 --> 00:47:59.760
But we got there,
and the best part

00:47:59.760 --> 00:48:03.050
about arriving at the
South Pole was not--

00:48:03.050 --> 00:48:05.370
it was sort of anti-climactic.

00:48:05.370 --> 00:48:06.570
It was over.

00:48:06.570 --> 00:48:08.010
It was done.

00:48:08.010 --> 00:48:10.410
And that actually was a
hard thing, to be over.

00:48:10.410 --> 00:48:12.330
Because every day, you're
focused on survival,

00:48:12.330 --> 00:48:14.220
and now, you don't have to be.

00:48:14.220 --> 00:48:18.750
So they opened up the
restaurant, the galley for us,

00:48:18.750 --> 00:48:22.200
and we had three hours of--

00:48:22.200 --> 00:48:24.120
let me tell you,
this was heaven.

00:48:24.120 --> 00:48:27.477
We had three hours of nonstop
eating at the South Pole,

00:48:27.477 --> 00:48:28.560
because we were so hungry.

00:48:28.560 --> 00:48:30.210
It was the end of a day.

00:48:30.210 --> 00:48:32.790
We touched the brass
plate at the South Pole,

00:48:32.790 --> 00:48:35.994
and this is video
footage from that.

00:48:35.994 --> 00:48:36.660
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:48:36.660 --> 00:48:37.160
- Day 43.

00:48:40.075 --> 00:48:40.950
We changed tentmates.

00:48:40.950 --> 00:48:41.180
- Morning.

00:48:41.180 --> 00:48:41.800
[INAUDIBLE]

00:48:41.800 --> 00:48:44.570
- Anne is with Sunniva
and is back on track.

00:48:44.570 --> 00:48:47.300
Anne led three times today
and is walking normal

00:48:47.300 --> 00:48:50.240
and is talkative,
right on schedule.

00:48:50.240 --> 00:48:52.720
One comes up, the
other goes down,

00:48:52.720 --> 00:48:56.850
and I don't care, as
long as we keep moving.

00:48:56.850 --> 00:49:00.500
Day 44-- the ankle is
definitely aggravated

00:49:00.500 --> 00:49:02.490
by the weight and climb.

00:49:02.490 --> 00:49:06.050
I can't change the uphill,
but I can change the weight.

00:49:06.050 --> 00:49:08.330
I tell her there are
different types of weight--

00:49:08.330 --> 00:49:10.850
sled weight, emotional weight.

00:49:10.850 --> 00:49:14.070
She keeps Sue and Anne going,
and I need her for that.

00:49:14.070 --> 00:49:15.166
And it takes energy.

00:49:19.110 --> 00:49:21.680
I would be out with
the radio, you know,

00:49:21.680 --> 00:49:24.080
and everybody would
have already had dinner.

00:49:24.080 --> 00:49:25.700
And I'm still
stringing the antenna.

00:49:25.700 --> 00:49:28.850
And if she was my tentmate,
it would never fail.

00:49:28.850 --> 00:49:32.360
I would come crawling into
the tent cold and miserable

00:49:32.360 --> 00:49:34.280
and sort of feeling
sorry for myself,

00:49:34.280 --> 00:49:37.420
and there'd be a
cup of hot soup.

00:49:37.420 --> 00:49:40.590
You know, she always did
that, and the others did not,

00:49:40.590 --> 00:49:42.130
myself included.

00:49:42.130 --> 00:49:44.704
We were in our
hunkered-down survival mode.

00:49:44.704 --> 00:49:46.120
You know, you can
get it yourself.

00:49:46.120 --> 00:49:47.440
[GIGGLES]

00:49:47.440 --> 00:49:49.510
- I mean, it became very
spiritual in a sense,

00:49:49.510 --> 00:49:53.560
because you know, when things
happen to you physically,

00:49:53.560 --> 00:49:55.400
you don't have control.

00:49:55.400 --> 00:49:57.160
And so it becomes
bigger than you are.

00:49:57.160 --> 00:50:00.460
And when you let go, I
think the process of change

00:50:00.460 --> 00:50:02.080
starts to happen in you.

00:50:02.080 --> 00:50:03.700
And you see things differently.

00:50:03.700 --> 00:50:05.440
You allow yourself to grow.

00:50:05.440 --> 00:50:08.089
But what I didn't realize
was that me being changed

00:50:08.089 --> 00:50:09.380
would be through all this pain.

00:50:12.880 --> 00:50:15.830
- As we get closer, we begin
to realize what looks like

00:50:15.830 --> 00:50:18.760
a little tent is actually a
three or four-story building.

00:50:18.760 --> 00:50:21.010
You have no
perspective whatsoever.

00:50:21.010 --> 00:50:22.780
At one level, I was
absolutely ecstatic,

00:50:22.780 --> 00:50:25.280
because as the navigator,
I'd found the South

00:50:25.280 --> 00:50:26.530
Pole in the middle of nowhere.

00:50:26.530 --> 00:50:28.750
- And I first hear
the noise, and then I

00:50:28.750 --> 00:50:30.650
see the figure of
the snowmobile.

00:50:30.650 --> 00:50:32.680
And then, I smell the diesel.

00:50:32.680 --> 00:50:38.290
And so you talk about your
senses being reawakened.

00:50:38.290 --> 00:50:40.780
- There were three people
on snowmobile coming out

00:50:40.780 --> 00:50:43.290
to greet us, and we were amazed.

00:50:43.290 --> 00:50:44.521
- There were people there.

00:50:44.521 --> 00:50:45.020
- Wow.

00:50:45.020 --> 00:50:47.420
[GIGGLES] This is a big event.

00:50:47.420 --> 00:50:49.030
- And so these
people filtered out

00:50:49.030 --> 00:50:52.150
of these building,
this research station.

00:50:52.150 --> 00:50:54.190
And they came, and they
were cheering us on.

00:50:54.190 --> 00:50:56.445
- We were very much,
I think, like horses

00:50:56.445 --> 00:50:57.320
heading for the barn.

00:50:57.320 --> 00:50:59.704
I mean, we just started
going faster and faster.

00:50:59.704 --> 00:51:02.120
- All of a sudden, you weren't
in control of your thoughts

00:51:02.120 --> 00:51:02.620
anymore.

00:51:02.620 --> 00:51:04.330
You just had to let
things happen to you.

00:51:04.330 --> 00:51:07.360
- This is taking us a while
to sort of plod our way

00:51:07.360 --> 00:51:09.190
to the pole, the visual pole.

00:51:09.190 --> 00:51:09.910
We're seeing it.

00:51:09.910 --> 00:51:11.290
We're going there.

00:51:11.290 --> 00:51:14.080
At this point, I've got the
group shoulder to shoulder,

00:51:14.080 --> 00:51:17.830
because I want us to come in
together to signify this team.

00:51:17.830 --> 00:51:19.330
- And these people come out.

00:51:19.330 --> 00:51:20.860
And they're shaking your hand.

00:51:20.860 --> 00:51:22.840
And they're just so
excited, and we've

00:51:22.840 --> 00:51:24.890
got to to be the first people
to come out and meet you guys.

00:51:24.890 --> 00:51:26.075
This is just the neatest thing.

00:51:26.075 --> 00:51:27.360
- And they're walking with us.

00:51:27.360 --> 00:51:29.290
It's almost like a parade.

00:51:29.290 --> 00:51:31.030
People are cheering
on the sidelines.

00:51:31.030 --> 00:51:33.860
And they're telling us,
you know, yay for women.

00:51:33.860 --> 00:51:34.360
- Good job.

00:51:34.360 --> 00:51:36.355
[GIGGLES] Glad you're here.

00:51:36.355 --> 00:51:38.470
And congratulations.

pole marker together.

00:51:46.090 --> 00:51:48.270
- There is no
evidence any longer.

00:51:48.270 --> 00:51:51.710
I mean, if you look at Sunniva's
face, you do not see pain,

00:51:51.710 --> 00:51:55.380
and we're not rushing her
off to some medical facility.

00:51:55.380 --> 00:51:59.100
We are reveling in the fact
that we are there, just

00:51:59.100 --> 00:52:01.050
by the mere dint that
we were standing there

00:52:01.050 --> 00:52:03.448
for so long freezing to death.

SUNNIVA SORBY: Arrived
there at the pole,

00:52:22.480 --> 00:52:25.240
and it was minus 76 degrees.

00:52:25.240 --> 00:52:26.907
And we were picked up there.

00:52:26.907 --> 00:52:28.990
Took us three days to get
away from the South Pole

00:52:28.990 --> 00:52:31.115
back to Patriot Hills,
because the weather was bad,

00:52:31.115 --> 00:52:32.746
so like a theme running through.

00:52:32.746 --> 00:52:34.120
And then we get
to Patriot Hills,

00:52:34.120 --> 00:52:36.250
and we're flown
back to Minnesota,

00:52:36.250 --> 00:52:39.460
where a throng of young
kids were there to greet us.

00:52:39.460 --> 00:52:42.160
The best part with that was
that they all had these flowers,

00:52:42.160 --> 00:52:43.970
these carnations
that they were given.

00:52:43.970 --> 00:52:45.640
And all the heads-- by
the time they got to us,

00:52:45.640 --> 00:52:47.045
all the heads had
been chopped off,

their-- making their way

And I have gone
down there, as he--

00:52:56.860 --> 00:52:59.800
James mentioned, 50 times
with Polar Latitudes--

00:52:59.800 --> 00:53:02.080
not just with Polar Latitudes,
but we operate ships

00:53:02.080 --> 00:53:02.920
down there as well.

00:53:02.920 --> 00:53:04.420
So I'm going to end
with this, and I

00:53:04.420 --> 00:53:05.890
want to take some questions.

00:53:05.890 --> 00:53:07.829
And I'm sorry if I
ran a little bit over.

00:53:07.829 --> 00:53:09.370
It's all good, but
we've got minutes.

00:53:09.370 --> 00:53:11.615
And does anyone have
any questions for me?

00:53:14.940 --> 00:53:15.834
Yeah.

00:53:15.834 --> 00:53:17.250
There's a mic there
if you'd like.

00:53:19.980 --> 00:53:22.860
AUDIENCE: I'm just curious
why you need four people.

00:53:22.860 --> 00:53:24.900
Like, do they go in
like different numbers,

00:53:24.900 --> 00:53:25.980
or do you always
need four people?

00:53:25.980 --> 00:53:27.354
SUNNIVA SORBY:
Ah, good question.

00:53:27.354 --> 00:53:28.060
Why four?

00:53:28.060 --> 00:53:30.870
So it was a logistics
scenario for us.

00:53:30.870 --> 00:53:34.290
They did have five women
join the trip at one point,

00:53:34.290 --> 00:53:36.570
and the alumni list
was quite long.

00:53:36.570 --> 00:53:39.300
People couldn't stay connected
to it because of family

00:53:39.300 --> 00:53:40.350
obligations or things.

00:53:40.350 --> 00:53:43.930
And it was a project that
took five years to pull off.

00:53:43.930 --> 00:53:46.950
So they wanted four
so that we could

00:53:46.950 --> 00:53:49.200
have two tents and two
people in each tent

00:53:49.200 --> 00:53:52.350
and then have our food bags
be, you know, 32 pounds

00:53:52.350 --> 00:53:53.320
and rotate that way.

00:53:53.320 --> 00:53:55.850
So it was really a
logistical thing.

00:53:55.850 --> 00:53:56.650
Thanks for asking.

00:53:56.650 --> 00:53:57.710

SUNNIVA SORBY: How did
we meet each other?

00:54:04.360 --> 00:54:07.500
I didn't know the three of them,
but they had met each other

00:54:07.500 --> 00:54:09.300
through the outdoor community.

00:54:09.300 --> 00:54:11.970
It's kind of a small
community in certain circles.

00:54:11.970 --> 00:54:15.450
My friend at the
time was writing

00:54:15.450 --> 00:54:17.760
an article on this expedition.

00:54:17.760 --> 00:54:22.190
And she learned
from Ann Bancroft

00:54:22.190 --> 00:54:24.560
in one of the phone
calls that they exchanged

00:54:24.560 --> 00:54:27.870
that Sarah had dropped out.

00:54:27.870 --> 00:54:31.610
And so my friend Deborah told
me, you should contact them.

00:54:31.610 --> 00:54:32.947
And I thought, no.

00:54:32.947 --> 00:54:34.280
I mean, that's the major league.

00:54:34.280 --> 00:54:35.510
I was in the minor league.

00:54:35.510 --> 00:54:37.010
But I made the phone call.

00:54:37.010 --> 00:54:39.590
I picked up the phone, and
I left a voicemail for Ann.

00:54:39.590 --> 00:54:41.580
I didn't hear from
her for two weeks,

00:54:41.580 --> 00:54:42.860
and then she called me back.

00:54:42.860 --> 00:54:45.296
And that's how-- how
I got to meet them.

00:54:45.296 --> 00:54:46.670
And then I met
them on the phone,

00:54:46.670 --> 00:54:48.590
was interviewed,
flew to Minnesota,

00:54:48.590 --> 00:54:52.190
and I had three days of
very deep self-analysis

00:54:52.190 --> 00:54:54.429
and inventory around
who I am, what

00:54:54.429 --> 00:54:55.970
am I capable of
doing, what am I not,

00:54:55.970 --> 00:54:58.550
and being really honest
about all of that with them.

00:54:58.550 --> 00:55:01.020
And then, they picked
me as the fourth.

00:55:01.020 --> 00:55:01.520
Yeah.

00:55:01.520 --> 00:55:02.020
Bless you.

interested in going
to Antarctica--

00:55:07.350 --> 00:55:10.760
not at all on an expedition
with the scope of what you did

00:55:10.760 --> 00:55:14.360
but just to visit and
see some amazing animals

00:55:14.360 --> 00:55:16.910
and wildlife-- are there
any programs specifically

00:55:16.910 --> 00:55:17.930
that you recommend?

00:55:17.930 --> 00:55:19.263
SUNNIVA SORBY: Yeah, absolutely.

00:55:19.263 --> 00:55:21.800
And I hope you
don't do what I did.

00:55:21.800 --> 00:55:24.020
There's a different way
to travel down there

00:55:24.020 --> 00:55:25.370
and expedition cruise ships.

00:55:25.370 --> 00:55:29.000
I feel like I am so lucky, and
I feel very, very fortunate

00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:32.750
I get to work with a company
called Polar Latitudes,

00:55:32.750 --> 00:55:37.490
and we operate 200-plus
passenger expedition ships.

00:55:37.490 --> 00:55:40.380
And we have-- that's all we do.

00:55:40.380 --> 00:55:42.830
From October until
March, we go down there.

00:55:42.830 --> 00:55:44.090
And it is a really--

00:55:44.090 --> 00:55:46.310
a fascinating way to
experience Antarctica,

00:55:46.310 --> 00:55:49.570
because you're-- it's a rite of
passage to go along the Drake,

00:55:49.570 --> 00:55:50.510
or through the Drake.

00:55:50.510 --> 00:55:52.700
And then slowly,
Antarctica is being

00:55:52.700 --> 00:55:53.930
revealed in all its glory.

00:55:53.930 --> 00:55:56.750
So the season is from
October until March.

00:55:56.750 --> 00:55:58.479
Lots of operators
down there, but--

00:55:58.479 --> 00:56:01.020
everybody likes to say they have
the best team on the planet,

00:56:01.020 --> 00:56:02.150
but I think we do.

00:56:02.150 --> 00:56:04.400
And part of that
is our experience.

00:56:04.400 --> 00:56:05.120
We're safe.

00:56:05.120 --> 00:56:07.400
When I'm down there,
I'm a historian onboard,

00:56:07.400 --> 00:56:09.620
and I drive a Zodiac.

00:56:09.620 --> 00:56:10.850
And we do citizen science.

00:56:10.850 --> 00:56:13.220
We're collecting
data for researchers

00:56:13.220 --> 00:56:16.700
at Scripps, for example, and
Woods Hole in Massachusetts.

00:56:16.700 --> 00:56:19.220
Because there are a
lot of people globally

00:56:19.220 --> 00:56:22.470
that are interested in what's
happening with climate change.

00:56:22.470 --> 00:56:25.340
And so we are, as an
operator, with all

00:56:25.340 --> 00:56:27.920
of those days in Antarctica,
we have an opportunity

00:56:27.920 --> 00:56:30.860
to collect data every
day for science.

00:56:30.860 --> 00:56:33.470
And so it's a program we do on
every single one of our trips.

00:56:33.470 --> 00:56:35.630
And it's the thing that
makes me really proud

00:56:35.630 --> 00:56:37.220
to be aligned with
Polar Latitudes,

00:56:37.220 --> 00:56:39.920
because we have to stay
relevant in today's world.

00:56:39.920 --> 00:56:42.490
Because things are changing,
and people want to do something,

00:56:42.490 --> 00:56:43.490
and they don't know how.

00:56:43.490 --> 00:56:46.010
So by engaging in
this, they're actually

00:56:46.010 --> 00:56:48.510
assisting the researchers that
are stuck in their office.

00:56:48.510 --> 00:56:49.880
So it's pretty cool.

00:56:49.880 --> 00:56:51.170
Join us.

00:56:51.170 --> 00:56:52.276
Yeah.

00:56:52.276 --> 00:56:52.775
Yes?

00:56:57.749 --> 00:56:58.290
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:56:58.290 --> 00:56:59.040
SUNNIVA SORBY: Hi.

00:56:59.040 --> 00:57:01.530
AUDIENCE: So when you do
something extreme like this,

00:57:01.530 --> 00:57:04.080
and you are injured
during the trip,

00:57:04.080 --> 00:57:06.490
and you're taking
medication, you're

00:57:06.490 --> 00:57:08.610
working through the
pain, how do you

00:57:08.610 --> 00:57:12.960
know when it's time to
quit or not to quit?

00:57:12.960 --> 00:57:14.910
When I look at your
ankle like that,

00:57:14.910 --> 00:57:18.150
I think I would be
scared about whether I

00:57:18.150 --> 00:57:22.560
could walk normally or run
again after I finished the trip.

00:57:22.560 --> 00:57:24.540
I imagine something like
that-- this probably

00:57:24.540 --> 00:57:25.810
happened during training too.

00:57:25.810 --> 00:57:28.572
You probably had injury
you had to work through.

00:57:28.572 --> 00:57:30.030
So I was just
wondering, how do you

00:57:30.030 --> 00:57:33.777
make that decision, when it's OK
to keep going and when to stop?

00:57:33.777 --> 00:57:35.610
SUNNIVA SORBY: That is
a very good question.

00:57:35.610 --> 00:57:37.990
Thank you for asking me that.

00:57:37.990 --> 00:57:41.010
And that is a tough
one, because we--

00:57:41.010 --> 00:57:44.070
our ego-- this is where the
ego is not a helpful thing

00:57:44.070 --> 00:57:46.480
on an expedition.

00:57:46.480 --> 00:57:48.870
There's a part of
us that that wants

00:57:48.870 --> 00:57:51.870
to overcome everything
and complete something

00:57:51.870 --> 00:57:53.640
at all costs.

00:57:53.640 --> 00:57:55.020
That's the ego at work.

00:57:55.020 --> 00:57:57.570
And then there's the
reality of how we really are

00:57:57.570 --> 00:57:58.590
and how far we can go.

00:57:58.590 --> 00:58:00.690
And can we realign and
readjust the needle

00:58:00.690 --> 00:58:03.450
to say that, no, this
is actually success

00:58:03.450 --> 00:58:04.800
and be OK with that?

00:58:04.800 --> 00:58:07.200
It's a really hard thing
for all of us humans.

00:58:07.200 --> 00:58:10.630
On this particular trip
for me, I was scared.

00:58:10.630 --> 00:58:13.870
I was scared a lot, and I had
no one to talk to about it.

00:58:13.870 --> 00:58:14.777
I had no one to--

00:58:14.777 --> 00:58:15.360
I had nothing.

00:58:15.360 --> 00:58:16.770
[LAUGHS] I couldn't Google.

00:58:16.770 --> 00:58:20.010
I couldn't get online
and ask, at what

00:58:20.010 --> 00:58:21.780
point-- how much
ibuprofen is going

00:58:21.780 --> 00:58:23.440
to eat up my stomach lining?

00:58:23.440 --> 00:58:25.230
Which happened, and
that's why I didn't--

00:58:25.230 --> 00:58:25.940
I wasn't hungry.

00:58:25.940 --> 00:58:26.800
I lost my appetite.

00:58:26.800 --> 00:58:30.480
So it's like that slowly, that
spiral downhill happens quickly

00:58:30.480 --> 00:58:32.010
into that dark abyss.

00:58:32.010 --> 00:58:36.420
So I had to be really
honest with myself first.

00:58:36.420 --> 00:58:37.860
And that was hard for me.

00:58:37.860 --> 00:58:40.560
It took me until December 24.

00:58:40.560 --> 00:58:42.540
Our expedition
ended on January 14.

00:58:42.540 --> 00:58:45.000
So for that entire time,
guess what I'm doing.

00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:48.311
Struggling, fighting myself.

00:58:48.311 --> 00:58:48.810
Why?

00:58:48.810 --> 00:58:50.130
You know, we do this.

00:58:50.130 --> 00:58:51.240
We all do it.

00:58:51.240 --> 00:58:54.750
And I got to a place where
I couldn't fight anymore.

00:58:54.750 --> 00:58:57.060
Very literally, I had
no fight left in me.

00:58:57.060 --> 00:58:58.670
I had no-- nothing--

00:58:58.670 --> 00:59:00.900
I had-- I was empty.

00:59:00.900 --> 00:59:04.170
And this, being empty
up here, scared me most.

00:59:04.170 --> 00:59:06.240
And when I got to that
place of being very, very

00:59:06.240 --> 00:59:12.560
empty with nothing to feed
myself, I surrendered.

00:59:12.560 --> 00:59:16.370
And what that looks like is just
the ultimate three days' worth

00:59:16.370 --> 00:59:18.697
of bawling my eyes
out in the Antarctic.

00:59:18.697 --> 00:59:20.780
And I'm Norwegian, and
we're kind of proud people.

00:59:20.780 --> 00:59:23.810
And we don't do that, so just
to give you some insight.

00:59:23.810 --> 00:59:26.000
And that was a very
freeing experience for me.

00:59:26.000 --> 00:59:28.970
And when I cried and I
let it all rip like that,

00:59:28.970 --> 00:59:32.780
I was embraced by Antarctica.

00:59:32.780 --> 00:59:36.770
I actually allowed myself
the space and the time

00:59:36.770 --> 00:59:44.530
to give it all up, let go,
detach from the outcome.

00:59:44.530 --> 00:59:45.860
Be in the moment.

00:59:45.860 --> 00:59:49.190
Allow yourself the
opportunity to be helped

00:59:49.190 --> 00:59:51.170
by something bigger than you.

00:59:51.170 --> 00:59:53.850
That's where the spiritual part
of the trip happens for me.

00:59:53.850 --> 00:59:58.640
And so when I got to that place
and I allowed other things

00:59:58.640 --> 01:00:00.180
to show up for me--

01:00:00.180 --> 01:00:03.710
and it was that little ice
crystal over there that

01:00:03.710 --> 01:00:05.430
happened to catch my attention.

01:00:05.430 --> 01:00:06.680
It was a little tiny--

01:00:06.680 --> 01:00:11.090
the minute I became aware of
something other than my pain

01:00:11.090 --> 01:00:15.560
and my suffering, phew, the
whole world opened up for me.

01:00:15.560 --> 01:00:17.840
So it was a very, very--

01:00:17.840 --> 01:00:20.360
I think it's super
important for us

01:00:20.360 --> 01:00:24.350
to give ourselves permission
to go to the edge.

01:00:24.350 --> 01:00:27.080
Because I think that we're
often afraid to go to the edge,

01:00:27.080 --> 01:00:29.480
because it's going to hurt me.

01:00:29.480 --> 01:00:30.500
We don't know this.

01:00:30.500 --> 01:00:31.610
And we're stronger for it.

01:00:31.610 --> 01:00:35.390
I used to think that strength
was physical strength, somebody

01:00:35.390 --> 01:00:37.220
reaching the top of a
summit by themselves

01:00:37.220 --> 01:00:39.470
or skiing across the
South Pole by yourself.

01:00:39.470 --> 01:00:41.180
But strength is
really our willingness

01:00:41.180 --> 01:00:43.220
to admit a weakness.

01:00:43.220 --> 01:00:44.630
That's what I believe.

01:00:44.630 --> 01:00:46.520
And the second we're
willing to admit

01:00:46.520 --> 01:00:49.220
that we're less than
who we thought we are,

01:00:49.220 --> 01:00:51.740
I think we give room and
space to other things coming

01:00:51.740 --> 01:00:54.380
into the purview and
making us stronger.

01:00:54.380 --> 01:00:57.030
I know that's a
sideways answer for you,

01:00:57.030 --> 01:00:58.730
but I hope it does
answer your question.

01:00:58.730 --> 01:01:02.090
Because it was a very
much an internal decision

01:01:02.090 --> 01:01:03.690
I had to make.

01:01:03.690 --> 01:01:08.450
I could have very easily
said, ladies, I'm stopping.

01:01:08.450 --> 01:01:09.860
I want an-- I want a heli--

01:01:09.860 --> 01:01:11.555
I want an airlift
out of here now.

01:01:11.555 --> 01:01:13.850
And it would have taken three
days for me to get help.

01:01:13.850 --> 01:01:16.340
But I was too proud to do
that, and I was too committed

01:01:16.340 --> 01:01:17.840
to the team experience.

01:01:17.840 --> 01:01:22.220
So I pushed harder and to the
edge every minute and every day

01:01:22.220 --> 01:01:23.990
just to keep it all together.

01:01:23.990 --> 01:01:29.370
And I think we're capable of
much more than we think we are.

01:01:29.370 --> 01:01:30.860
I hope that answers
your question.

01:01:30.860 --> 01:01:32.670
Thanks.

01:01:32.670 --> 01:01:33.480
Anybody else?

01:01:36.630 --> 01:01:38.800
Well, thank you guys for coming.

01:01:38.800 --> 01:01:40.110
Yeah, I really appreciate it.

01:01:40.110 --> 01:01:41.200
[APPLAUSE]

01:01:41.200 --> 01:01:43.457
Thank you, guys and gals.

01:01:43.457 --> 01:01:45.165
So that's how I spent
my summer vacation.

01:01:45.165 --> 01:01:50.370
[LAUGHS] I really appreciate
you taking the time

01:01:50.370 --> 01:01:52.720
and coming in to
listen to this today.

01:01:52.720 --> 01:01:55.740
And so go out there and
make some magic happen.

01:01:55.740 --> 01:01:56.340
Thank you.

01:01:56.340 --> 01:01:59.690
[APPLAUSE]
