currently sharing the same banking
 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:17.870
currently sharing the same banking
system it's a banking system where the

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880
system it's a banking system where the

money in circulation is created as debt
by banks at interest so it means that

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250
by banks at interest so it means that
 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.359

debt that's how it was created suddenly
 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:33.290

there's a lot less money in the economy

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300
there's a lot less money in the economy
 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.260
there's a lot less money in the economy
that means there's less money for people

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270
that means there's less money for people
 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.310
that means there's less money for people
to buy stuff it's less money to invest

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:39.320
to buy stuff it's less money to invest

to buy stuff it's less money to invest
less money for wages and for jobs and so

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420
less money for wages and for jobs and so
 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.440
less money for wages and for jobs and so
that is the key cause of rising

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450
that is the key cause of rising
 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.799
that is the key cause of rising
unemployment in most economies right now

00:00:47.799 --> 00:00:47.809
unemployment in most economies right now
 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:50.150
unemployment in most economies right now
it's not that suddenly people are less

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160
it's not that suddenly people are less
 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.010
it's not that suddenly people are less
skilled all that there's to suddenly be

banking system that we've got at the
 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.359
banking system that we've got at the
moment and the way that governments

moment and the way that governments
can't raise money other than through

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530
can't raise money other than through
 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.200
can't raise money other than through
selling bonds so they can't issue their

selling bonds so they can't issue their
 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.480
selling bonds so they can't issue their
own earn money whether this really is a

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490
own earn money whether this really is a
 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.700
own earn money whether this really is a
sustainable monetary system whether this

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710
sustainable monetary system whether this
 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.160
sustainable monetary system whether this
is a desirable monetary system for our

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170
is a desirable monetary system for our
 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.010
is a desirable monetary system for our
multiple interests names whether that's

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020
multiple interests names whether that's
 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.190
multiple interests names whether that's
full employment whether it's less

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200
full employment whether it's less

inequality more environmental

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570
inequality more environmental
 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.030
inequality more environmental
sustainability and so on so we need to

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040
sustainability and so on so we need to
 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.880
sustainability and so on so we need to
listen to unorthodox economists about

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890
listen to unorthodox economists about
 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.090

monetary systems and military redesign
 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.760
monetary systems and military redesign
and we need to start looking at various

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770
and we need to start looking at various
 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.920
and we need to start looking at various
different policy measures that could be

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930
different policy measures that could be
 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.980
different policy measures that could be
used in the UK where I'm from there's a

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990
used in the UK where I'm from there's a
 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.950
used in the UK where I'm from there's a
campaign called positive money and they

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960
campaign called positive money and they
 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.980
campaign called positive money and they
have drafted some legislation that they

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990
have drafted some legislation that they
 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.469
have drafted some legislation that they
would like to be discussed about

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:05.479
would like to be discussed about
 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:07.940
would like to be discussed about
basically moving to full reserve banking

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950
basically moving to full reserve banking
 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.440
basically moving to full reserve banking
and restoring the ability of the

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450
and restoring the ability of the
 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:10.940
and restoring the ability of the
government to issue its own

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950
government to issue its own
 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.190
government to issue its own
currency and I'm that that isn't it like

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200
currency and I'm that that isn't it like
 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.440
currency and I'm that that isn't it like
a criticism of one currency over another

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450
a criticism of one currency over another
 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.050
a criticism of one currency over another
because all currencies today seem to be

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060
because all currencies today seem to be
 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.449
because all currencies today seem to be
issued as debt by banks so you know they

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:20.459
issued as debt by banks so you know they
 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:21.680

call it the euro the dollar the pound
 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.420
call it the euro the dollar the pound
whatever ultimately it's the same

money in that it's created as credit by

money in that it's created as credit by
banks but what I work on isn't that

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400
banks but what I work on isn't that
 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.130
banks but what I work on isn't that
because that's obviously quite a complex

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140
because that's obviously quite a complex
 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.110
because that's obviously quite a complex
issue and it's going to take one all the

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120
issue and it's going to take one all the
 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.289
issue and it's going to take one all the
time and a lot of a lot of people with a

amongst themselves so it's like a

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170
amongst themselves so it's like a
 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:07.360
amongst themselves so it's like a
alternative currency system and those

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370
alternative currency system and those
 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:10.309
alternative currency system and those
those those communities are benefiting

00:03:10.309 --> 00:03:10.319
those those communities are benefiting
 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:12.430
those those communities are benefiting
from the fact that if they are cash poor

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.440
from the fact that if they are cash poor
 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:15.050
from the fact that if they are cash poor
they can still do stuff for each other

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060
they can still do stuff for each other
 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.199
they can still do stuff for each other
and they have this alternative way of

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:17.209
and they have this alternative way of
 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:19.520
and they have this alternative way of
monitoring that accounting for that so

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530
monitoring that accounting for that so
 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:22.490
monitoring that accounting for that so
it's it's a form of currency we call it

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500
it's it's a form of currency we call it
 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.500
it's it's a form of currency we call it
mutual credit and so this is growing now

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510
mutual credit and so this is growing now
 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:26.150
mutual credit and so this is growing now
and we're looking at ways of rolling

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160
and we're looking at ways of rolling
 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.309
and we're looking at ways of rolling
this out for for companies as well and

this out for for companies as well and
we're working with banks or like a

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680
we're working with banks or like a
 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.289

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:59.120
sustainable economy locally nationally
and ultimately worldwide so this is the

00:03:59.120 --> 00:03:59.130
and ultimately worldwide so this is the

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650
kind of thing I'm talking to people hear
 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:06.170
kind of thing I'm talking to people hear
about in the corridors some some of

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:06.180
about in the corridors some some of

about in the corridors some some of
these issues are coming out slightly in

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:07.980
these issues are coming out slightly in
 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:11.300
these issues are coming out slightly in
the plenaries but generally we've still

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310
the plenaries but generally we've still
 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:14.089
the plenaries but generally we've still
got a long way to go for understanding

00:04:14.089 --> 00:04:14.099
got a long way to go for understanding
 

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:16.279
got a long way to go for understanding
and really intelligent discussions about

00:04:16.279 --> 00:04:16.289
and really intelligent discussions about
 

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:18.589
and really intelligent discussions about
monetary systems monetary reform and

00:04:18.589 --> 00:04:18.599
monetary systems monetary reform and
 

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:21.530
monetary systems monetary reform and
also complementary alternatives

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:21.540
also complementary alternatives
 

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:25.340
also complementary alternatives
like the systems that I'm involved in so

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:25.350
like the systems that I'm involved in so
 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:26.980
like the systems that I'm involved in so
hopefully that's giving you some

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:26.990
hopefully that's giving you some
 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:29.510
hopefully that's giving you some
slightly different take on the the

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:29.520

the and the need to actually have some
 

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:39.440
the and the need to actually have some
new ideas about solving it
