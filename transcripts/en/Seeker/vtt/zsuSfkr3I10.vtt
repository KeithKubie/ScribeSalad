00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:08.029
We all can appreciate how important vision
is for the way we and animals perceive our

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:09.029
environment.

00:00:09.029 --> 00:00:15.490
It's fascinating how nature evolved and created
all these sort of specializations for every

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:16.660
species.

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:19.860
The eye is one of evolution’s greatest successes.

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:24.340
It acts like a camera that focuses light,
and converts it into an electrical signal

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:27.090
that the brain translates into images.

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.400
Everything needs to work in perfect harmony
for vision to happen.

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:41.930
But the smallest shift in those sensitive
mechanics can result in a loss of vision.

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:46.300
Inside this special lab, scientists are studying
what happens to animal eyes that can no longer

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.280
focus light.

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:54.870
We study the disease of the eye or the ocular
tissues so that we can understand ocular disease

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.420
better and treat their patients.

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.130
Founded by Emeritus Professor Dick Dubielzig
and currently run by Dr. Leandro Teixeira,

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:09.620
the work happening here is equal parts diagnostic
lab and exotic animal eye collection.

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:16.159
We receive samples from almost every single
state in the US, clients from Europe, clients

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:17.560
from Hong Kong.

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:19.720
Basically, everywhere in the world.

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:27.510
The size of our obsessions has multiplied
every year since then and continues to multiply.

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:30.720
There are over 60, 000 different specimens
stored here.

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:37.670
And while the majority are dog, cat and horse
eyes, there are 6,000 exotic ones like jaguars,

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:39.830
bonobos, and even whale eyes.

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:42.050
“This is currently the biggest eye COPLOW
has.

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:43.050
Whoa!

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:44.050
Look at that guy.

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:45.050
That is beautiful.

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:48.020
Look at that guy.”

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:52.500
Every single day, there's a challenge it's
safe to say that on a weekly basis we get

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.460
cases that we've never seen before.

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:59.820
A day at the lab begins with a pile of unknowns,
just waiting to be opened.

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.280
The first thing that we look for is the overall
shape of the eye.

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:04.890
Is there anything distorted?

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:05.890
Is there a mass?

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:11.849
Is there any change in the tissue basically
from outside even before we cut?

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:16.819
Tissue goes through an overnight processing
to a machine just to dehydrate.

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:20.420
The paraffin enters the tissue, and then you
make a block of paraffin.

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:22.730
We proceed to sectioning the tissue.

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:28.409
The goal here is to have in the end a very
thin section of that tissue on a slide, stained

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:29.870
so we can look at a microscope.

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:31.069
We have a five headed microscope.

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:35.870
We all sit together, look at it, read the
story of the case and try to understand what's

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:37.049
happening.

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:44.120
These are two eyes from a walrus and a walrus
is a pinniped, they hunt under water using

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.120
vision.

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.529
So they need to see underwater and they also
need to see above water.

00:02:47.529 --> 00:02:51.069
There are some special modifications of the
eye that account for that.

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:56.819
A lot of animals that need to see above and
below water tend to have a very flat cornea.

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:00.269
My favorite eye is that of the chameleon.

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:03.980
Their eyes move independently, back and forth,
and they catch insects with their tongue,

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:07.999
which requires a good depth perception, but
they don't use their two eyes together.

00:03:07.999 --> 00:03:15.709
There’s a staggering diversity of eye adaptations
in the animal kingdom, and it all sprung into

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:18.540
existence during one major event: the Cambrian
Period.

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:24.879
About 540 million years ago, life transformed
from a dull, microbial existence to an explosion

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:30.140
of animal diversity….and the evolution of
the eye is often considered the catalyst.

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:34.480
Understanding how life went from tiny organisms
to large complex creatures with visual systems

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.620
is an ongoing field of research.

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:38.730
Even Charles Darwin struggled with it.

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:52.579
Ultimately, animals process light 
to compete and survive.

00:03:52.579 --> 00:04:03.260
We're looking at a high magnification image
of a lens capsule of a cat.

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:07.790
The cat has been traumatized and the bright
magenta tissue that's been wrinkled up is

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:08.790
the lens cap.

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:13.870
This process - trauma to the lens and cats
is responsible for the second most common

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:18.220
cancer of the cat eye, which we call the post-traumatic
sarcoma.

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:21.900
Studying this kind of tumor in cats could
have a major impact on human cancer treatment.

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:26.700
Now we can study, what are the differences
between the lens epithelial cells in cats

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:34.010
and humans and try to see, "Oh, this gene
is off in humans but it's on in cats.

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:39.180
Is that switch present in other cells that
we can turn it on and off and try to regulate

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:40.740
cancer?"

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:44.870
This collection of eyes is a resource for
evolutionary biologists and veterinarians

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:50.480
alike, creating an unparalleled photographic
record, indexed by animal species.

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:55.180
By studying the disease origins, effects and
progression, we’re helping push the field

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:56.400
forward bit by bit.

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:02.540
It feels good to be able to help, and to know
that all that information is getting archived

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:20.210
in a way that we might be able to work with
and make an impact on animals' lives.
