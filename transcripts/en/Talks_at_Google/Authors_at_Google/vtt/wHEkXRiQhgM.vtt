00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:13.100
SPEAKER 1: So I just wanted
to get some background on you

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:15.240
first.

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.560
Now your website bio talks
about you starting authorship

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.750
on a dare from your wife.

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.080
So tell me about that.

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:24.038
DENNIS E. TAYLOR: Yeah.

00:00:24.038 --> 00:00:28.770
I had just discovered Kindle
and e-books at the time,

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:34.950
and I was downloading books like
crazy, free, paid, whatever.

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.680
I was reading one
particular book, which

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:45.900
shall remain forever nameless,
and it was less than excellent.

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:49.180
I got about 30 pages into it
and finally gave up and said,

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:53.160
I can't believe that somebody
managed to publish this dreck,

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.090
and I could do better than this.

00:00:55.090 --> 00:01:00.690
And my wife looked over and
said, well, why don't you?

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.550
Go ahead, write a book.

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.500
And I thought about
it for a while,

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.610
and then I just fired up
Word and started typing.

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.090
I had a choice of two stories
in my head at the time.

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:15.240
One was "Outland", one
was "We Are Legion".

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.560
I went with "Outland" first, but
that was just a flip of a coin.

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:19.553
SPEAKER 1: OK, yeah.

00:01:19.553 --> 00:01:21.220
And I've told everyone
already "Outland"

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:23.280
is my personal favorite by far.

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.780
But apparently you've had more
success with "We Are Legion".

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:27.130
DENNIS E. TAYLOR: Yeah.

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:28.820
SPEAKER 1: That's great.

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:31.620
So what about before
the authorship?

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:33.120
What was your life
like growing up,

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:37.170
and what inspired you
to know so much about

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.570
and be so involved in sci-fi?

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.690
DENNIS E. TAYLOR: I started
reading science fiction

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:45.300
in grade five.

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:47.640
I mentioned to you
"The Lost Planet"

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:53.490
by Angus MacVicar was
my first real novel.

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.440
I read it, I was
hooked, and I've

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:58.540
been reading almost nothing
but science fiction since.

00:01:58.540 --> 00:01:59.222
SPEAKER 1: OK.

00:01:59.222 --> 00:02:01.680
And do you feel like that's
been a big inspiration for you,

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.042
like a musician listens to
music to inspire their music?

00:02:05.042 --> 00:02:06.000
DENNIS E. TAYLOR: Yeah.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:06.750
It has to be.

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.363
I mean, I have no formal
training in creative writing

00:02:10.363 --> 00:02:11.280
or anything like that.

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.810
I don't have a degree.

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:22.015
So the style and
format and everything

00:02:22.015 --> 00:02:23.140
has to come from somewhere.

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:26.970
And I just think it comes
from 50 years of having

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:28.552
read science fiction books.

00:02:28.552 --> 00:02:29.260
SPEAKER 1: Great.

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:30.970
Great.

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:32.993
So a couple of notes.

00:02:32.993 --> 00:02:35.160
There's not going to be any
spoilers that I know of,

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.745
but there are going to
be spoilers of concepts

00:02:38.745 --> 00:02:39.620
that are in the book.

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:41.440
So reader beware.

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.282
You should read the book
first and then watch the talk,

00:02:44.282 --> 00:02:45.240
for those on the video.

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:51.077
For those in the
room, there's no hope.

00:02:51.077 --> 00:02:52.660
No, we're not going
to spoil anything,

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:55.710
but we will talk about a lot
of the concepts in the books.

00:02:55.710 --> 00:03:01.950
So you've said that you
were also a programmer.

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.390
Was that your lifelong career?

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:05.640
DENNIS E. TAYLOR: Pretty much.

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:12.270
I started programming in my
early 20s on RadioShack TRS 80

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:13.710
as a hobby.

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:18.848
And it just-- it's addictive.

00:03:18.848 --> 00:03:20.640
If you're the type of
personality who likes

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:21.810
programming, it's addictive.

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:24.510
You'll do it for fun.

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:28.260
And it was so addictive
that I ended up

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:33.180
getting a job in the
industry and moved myself up.

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:36.120
Back in those days, you
could get a job programming

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:39.760
if you could tell what side
of the keyboard was up.

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:43.890
So it wasn't like m
where you practically

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:47.933
have to have a PhD to
get in at an entry level.

00:03:47.933 --> 00:03:48.600
SPEAKER 1: Sure.

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:52.385
And so you came into
programming without any degree.

00:03:52.385 --> 00:03:53.342
That's pretty neat.

00:03:53.342 --> 00:03:54.300
DENNIS E. TAYLOR: Yeah.

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:57.480
I have a tendency to come
in through the back door.

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:58.570
It's kind of strange.

00:03:58.570 --> 00:03:58.690
SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:00.523
Well, you do the same
thing with your books.

00:04:00.523 --> 00:04:03.755
So you started at 57, was it?

00:04:03.755 --> 00:04:04.630
DENNIS E. TAYLOR: 51.

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:05.260
SPEAKER 1: 51.

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:05.950
OK.

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:07.140
DENNIS E. TAYLOR: Sorry.

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:08.103
Snowboarding, 51.

00:04:08.103 --> 00:04:09.270
SPEAKER 1: Snowboarding, 51.

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:09.530
DENNIS E. TAYLOR: Yeah.

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:10.603
Writing, 57.

00:04:10.603 --> 00:04:11.520
SPEAKER 1: Writing 57.

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:12.145
So there we go.

00:04:12.145 --> 00:04:14.860
There's two hobbies
that you picked up later

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:15.840
in the back door.

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:18.209
So that's pretty interesting.

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:24.060
You mentioned that you
started without a degree.

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:27.265
Did you ever get a degree
later in life with programming?

00:04:27.265 --> 00:04:28.140
DENNIS E. TAYLOR: No.

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:35.340
I was taking electronics
technology at VCIT

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:37.050
when I switched.

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:39.075
So I never finished that either.

00:04:39.075 --> 00:04:40.950
SPEAKER 1: When you
switched over to writing?

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:42.990
DENNIS E. TAYLOR: No, when I
switched over to programming.

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:44.365
SPEAKER 1:
Programming full time.

00:04:44.365 --> 00:04:44.950
Cool.

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:47.790
Well, I'd tell you you should
interview at Google, as I've

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:50.320
told many people, but I don't
want you to spend any more

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:51.670
time away from writing books.

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:54.570
So I'm sorry, but
please don't apply.

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:56.820
DENNIS E. TAYLOR: Well,
there's still a certain amount

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:58.080
of programming going on.

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:58.220
SPEAKER 1: Good.

00:04:58.220 --> 00:04:59.678
And actually, yeah,
we have a slide

00:04:59.678 --> 00:05:01.710
that we want to show
that's pretty interesting.

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:05.500
You wrote a program to track
all the different characters

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:06.660
in one of your books.

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:08.882
Can you tell us about this?

00:05:08.882 --> 00:05:10.340
DENNIS E. TAYLOR:
Well, I called it

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:16.880
Time A Line, which is really
bogus, but I needed a name.

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:18.480
It's written in C#.

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:22.230
And all it is is a way of
creating events and linking

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:25.740
them, creating dependencies.

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:27.120
The reason that
I wrote it myself

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:30.630
is because I wanted to have
lead times, variable lead times,

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:31.560
and so forth.

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:38.410
And the [? eon ?] timeline,
which was the free timeline

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:40.630
program that I
could find online,

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:42.730
didn't offer some of
the stuff that I wanted.

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:48.010
So I hammered that together,
and it became my event tracker

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:49.720
for the Bobiverse.

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:51.105
SPEAKER 1: That's pretty fun.

00:05:51.105 --> 00:05:52.480
Do you still use
that when you're

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:53.713
writing your books today?

00:05:53.713 --> 00:05:54.880
DENNIS E. TAYLOR: I have to.

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:55.660
Yeah.

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:57.430
The thing about the
Bobiverse series

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:01.600
is because things happen
in different star systems

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:08.770
and on different schedules, the
overlaps and lightspeed delay

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:13.070
and stuff like that really
require a lot of planning.

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:13.870
SPEAKER 1: Cool.

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:16.580
Yeah, I mean, reading them is--

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:18.840
honestly, the program could
be useful for the readers.

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:20.590
You should make a
version for us so we can

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:23.472
track all the different bobs.

00:06:23.472 --> 00:06:24.430
DENNIS E. TAYLOR: Yeah.

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:26.097
I actually did take
a screenshot of that

00:06:26.097 --> 00:06:31.660
and publish it on my web page
based on somebody's request.

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:34.030
And I'll have to do that
again when books four and five

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:34.690
come out.

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:36.580
SPEAKER 1: Yeah,
it'd be interesting

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:42.070
if this is a feature request,
if you wrote a program that

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:44.060
allowed us to track where
we're at in the book

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:46.790
so we could know where
all the Bobs are.

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:48.760
But you have plenty
of writing to do,

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:53.812
so I'll put that on the backlog.

00:06:53.812 --> 00:06:55.395
Tell us about which
works you've done.

00:06:55.395 --> 00:07:00.730
So you've done "We Are
Legion" and "Outland".

00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:03.208
How many books are in each?

00:07:03.208 --> 00:07:05.500
DENNIS E. TAYLOR: OK, well,
I originally did "Outland".

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:07.900
That was my first book.

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:09.317
SPEAKER 1: My favorite.

00:07:09.317 --> 00:07:10.900
DENNIS E. TAYLOR: I
wrote a little bit

00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:13.930
of the sequel, "Earthside",
I think about a 1/3 of it.

00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:16.720
And then I started
writing "Legio" because I

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:18.880
wanted to get on with things.

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:23.200
"Legion", "For We Are Many"
and "All These Worlds" form

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:29.870
a trilogy, and they wrap up
all the threads pretty well.

00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:32.180
And then I wrote
"Singularity Trap",

00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:35.110
which is a complete departure.

00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:38.860
And, once that was out,
I re-edited "Outland"

00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:42.550
because when Audible
signed a contract with me

00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:47.050
for the "Singularity
Trap" contract,

00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:48.550
they also signed a
separate contract

00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:50.440
for "Outland" and "Earthside".

00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:52.750
So that's an obligation.

00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:59.660
So we re-edited it, and that's
coming out in audio May 16.

00:07:59.660 --> 00:08:00.427
SPEAKER 1: Great.

00:08:00.427 --> 00:08:01.260
That'll be exciting.

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:04.060
I'll pick that up
soon as it's out.

00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:07.560
You mentioned you
work with Audible,

00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:10.212
but otherwise you're
self-published, right?

00:08:10.212 --> 00:08:11.170
DENNIS E. TAYLOR: Yeah.

00:08:11.170 --> 00:08:16.962
My agent shopped around "Legion"
to all the big five publishers

00:08:16.962 --> 00:08:18.670
and all the various
editors and so forth,

00:08:18.670 --> 00:08:22.760
and he didn't really get a bite.

00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:26.680
I think the main reason
is that I am, or was,

00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:30.100
an unknown author, and he
was shopping a trilogy.

00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:31.250
And that's kind of a no-no.

00:08:31.250 --> 00:08:37.390
You don't try to shop a series
as your very first book.

00:08:37.390 --> 00:08:40.909
It's too big of a gamble
for the publishers.

00:08:40.909 --> 00:08:42.610
So anyway, nobody bit.

00:08:42.610 --> 00:08:46.780
But I had gotten an
offer from Audible,

00:08:46.780 --> 00:08:53.380
so we decided to go with the
audio contract and self-publish

00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:56.560
on Ethan's ASP website.

00:08:56.560 --> 00:08:59.680
It's author-assistant
publishing.

00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:02.380
I can never remember what
the acronym stands for.

00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:04.360
But basically what
he's got on there

00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:09.910
is Ian Douglas and Andrew
Norton and various authors

00:09:09.910 --> 00:09:12.555
who had their rights
reverted back to them.

00:09:12.555 --> 00:09:14.680
So it's not really supposed
to be a big moneymaker.

00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:22.570
It's just a place to get you off
published books onto e-books.

00:09:22.570 --> 00:09:25.720
So we put it up,
essentially, self-published,

00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:29.380
except that Ethan is taking
care of the technical details

00:09:29.380 --> 00:09:30.790
for me.

00:09:30.790 --> 00:09:36.310
And when the book
took off on Audible,

00:09:36.310 --> 00:09:43.820
it took off as an e-book, and
a paperback just dragged along

00:09:43.820 --> 00:09:45.183
in the current.

00:09:45.183 --> 00:09:45.850
SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:09:45.850 --> 00:09:48.710
Well, I remember I had
just finished some books

00:09:48.710 --> 00:09:49.700
from Evan Currie--

00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:51.242
I think that's how
you say his name--

00:09:51.242 --> 00:09:52.040
Odyssey One books.

00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:57.520
And they were basic blow 'em up
aliens books, and I loved them.

00:09:57.520 --> 00:10:00.020
But I was looking for something
else, and I found "Outland".

00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:02.720
And I was quite dismayed
when I finished "Outland"

00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:04.610
and found out that there were--

00:10:04.610 --> 00:10:06.470
I mean, I didn't
know who you were.

00:10:06.470 --> 00:10:07.190
I read the book.

00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:08.798
I'm like, OK, this other rocks.

00:10:08.798 --> 00:10:10.340
And so I looked for
your other works,

00:10:10.340 --> 00:10:12.322
and there was nothing else.

00:10:12.322 --> 00:10:13.280
DENNIS E. TAYLOR: Yeah.

00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:16.400
So you must have picked
it up before "Legion"

00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:17.600
was actually released.

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:18.767
SPEAKER 1: Yeah, I think so.

00:10:18.767 --> 00:10:21.480
And then, fortunately, you
released the "We Are Legion"

00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:24.620
books pretty quickly behind
each other, didn't you?

00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:26.270
DENNIS E. TAYLOR: Yes.

00:10:26.270 --> 00:10:30.110
I actually had books two
and three partly written

00:10:30.110 --> 00:10:32.250
by the time book
one was released.

00:10:32.250 --> 00:10:33.850
So there wasn't
much of a lead time.

00:10:33.850 --> 00:10:36.950
I think that was
September, 2016,

00:10:36.950 --> 00:10:40.327
and the others were published
the next April and August.

00:10:40.327 --> 00:10:40.910
SPEAKER 1: OK.

00:10:40.910 --> 00:10:43.118
And can you tell us a little
bit about the difference

00:10:43.118 --> 00:10:46.670
between being a self-published
author versus going

00:10:46.670 --> 00:10:49.130
the other route?

00:10:49.130 --> 00:10:52.460
DENNIS E. TAYLOR: Well, the
biggest single difference

00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:57.800
from my point of view is
the amount of royalties.

00:10:57.800 --> 00:10:59.630
Traditionally,
published authors do not

00:10:59.630 --> 00:11:02.360
get a large chunk of the pie.

00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:05.810
And traditional
publishers are very

00:11:05.810 --> 00:11:08.960
slow about delivering
that very small chunk,

00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:11.960
whereas dealing with Amazon,
I get paid every month,

00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:15.140
and dealing with Audible
I get paid every quarter.

00:11:15.140 --> 00:11:18.350
With Amazon, you
get 70% of the list

00:11:18.350 --> 00:11:21.710
price of the book
less my agent's 15%,

00:11:21.710 --> 00:11:25.910
of course, whereas a
traditionally published author

00:11:25.910 --> 00:11:32.520
might get, I don't know,
25% of the list price

00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:35.580
or less, depending on contract.

00:11:35.580 --> 00:11:36.250
So yeah.

00:11:36.250 --> 00:11:39.030
It makes a huge difference.

00:11:39.030 --> 00:11:40.680
Martha Wells-- I
don't know if you've

00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:42.570
read any of anything
of hers, but she's

00:11:42.570 --> 00:11:44.400
one of the few
authors who are very

00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:47.910
candid about their finances.

00:11:47.910 --> 00:11:51.090
And she's actually published
her financial statements

00:11:51.090 --> 00:11:52.720
for a couple of years now.

00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:57.530
I think she showed herself as
making about $50,000 a year

00:11:57.530 --> 00:11:58.800
writing.

00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:05.670
So her husband continues to have
a day job because that's how

00:12:05.670 --> 00:12:10.290
they get the medical paid for.

00:12:10.290 --> 00:12:13.920
So it's not really a
life-changing thing

00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:16.080
for a traditional
published author

00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:19.170
unless you're Michael
Crighton or Stephen King

00:12:19.170 --> 00:12:20.315
or something like that.

00:12:20.315 --> 00:12:22.160
SPEAKER 1: Really huge, yeah.

00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:25.200
Well, who takes care of all
the printing of the books

00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:27.710
and things like that?

00:12:27.710 --> 00:12:31.820
DENNIS E. TAYLOR: Well, the
simple answer is Amazon.

00:12:31.820 --> 00:12:36.500
But my agent has taken on the
job of publisher for that.

00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:40.100
So he does all the things
that a self-published author

00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:44.030
would normally do, formatting
up the Word document,

00:12:44.030 --> 00:12:47.240
submitting it, making sure
that it's properly formatted,

00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:51.537
getting a cover,
stuff like that.

00:12:51.537 --> 00:12:52.120
SPEAKER 1: OK.

00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:53.495
That's a lot of
good information.

00:12:53.495 --> 00:12:54.742
I've been curious myself.

00:12:54.742 --> 00:12:56.200
DENNIS E. TAYLOR:
It's not actually

00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:58.300
a lot of work in the end.

00:12:58.300 --> 00:13:00.400
And you can publish
a book yourself

00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:04.715
without ever spending a penny,
if you can do your own artwork.

00:13:04.715 --> 00:13:06.340
SPEAKER 1: Did you
do your own artwork?

00:13:06.340 --> 00:13:07.720
DENNIS E. TAYLOR: No.

00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:10.840
SPEAKER 1: Who did your artwork?

00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:14.680
DENNIS E. TAYLOR: Jeff
Brown is the guy's name.

00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:18.880
He's actually a graphics
artist professionally.

00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:23.175
And I had him do all three
covers at the same time

00:13:23.175 --> 00:13:25.050
so that there was a
theme running through it.

00:13:25.050 --> 00:13:27.952
Just the color
changed and so forth.

00:13:27.952 --> 00:13:29.160
SPEAKER 1: I've been curious.

00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:32.517
Which one of these is
the Bob and which is--

00:13:32.517 --> 00:13:34.350
I don't even know how
to pronounce his name.

00:13:34.350 --> 00:13:35.400
Madeiros?

00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:36.525
DENNIS E. TAYLOR: Madeiros?

00:13:36.525 --> 00:13:38.820
Yeah, that is Bob.

00:13:38.820 --> 00:13:41.853
And that is actually
an image from--

00:13:41.853 --> 00:13:43.020
SPEAKER 1: A long sleek one.

00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:45.030
DENNIS E. TAYLOR: Yeah.

00:13:45.030 --> 00:13:48.660
I did a blender
mockup of the ship

00:13:48.660 --> 00:13:52.140
when I was developing
it, just trying to get

00:13:52.140 --> 00:13:54.367
a feel for what might work.

00:13:54.367 --> 00:13:56.700
And when Jeff was doing the
cover, he asked me about it,

00:13:56.700 --> 00:14:00.180
and I said yeah, I've
got this blender render.

00:14:00.180 --> 00:14:01.470
Here you go.

00:14:01.470 --> 00:14:03.698
And he put it on the cover.

00:14:03.698 --> 00:14:04.740
SPEAKER 1: Blender enter.

00:14:04.740 --> 00:14:07.950
That's pretty catchy, too.

00:14:07.950 --> 00:14:12.425
You've been writing for how
long, then, since you started?

00:14:12.425 --> 00:14:13.800
DENNIS E. TAYLOR:
Well, "Outland"

00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:16.710
was published January
of 2015, so a little

00:14:16.710 --> 00:14:18.750
more than four years,
five years if you

00:14:18.750 --> 00:14:20.200
include the lead time on that.

00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:22.020
SPEAKER 1: That makes
sense because I must

00:14:22.020 --> 00:14:24.110
have picked it up right after.

00:14:24.110 --> 00:14:28.110
2015, I think, is when I
start reading your works.

00:14:28.110 --> 00:14:31.175
And so that's what,
four years now?

00:14:31.175 --> 00:14:32.800
DENNIS E. TAYLOR:
Four and a bit, yeah.

00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:34.133
SPEAKER 1: That's not very long.

00:14:34.133 --> 00:14:37.317
You have four or
five books now, plus

00:14:37.317 --> 00:14:38.900
you did another work,
too, didn't you,

00:14:38.900 --> 00:14:40.900
the group published?

00:14:40.900 --> 00:14:44.500
DENNIS E. TAYLOR: Oh, the short
story, yeah, in the Colony

00:14:44.500 --> 00:14:45.940
series.

00:14:45.940 --> 00:14:48.643
I think I mentioned to you that
wasn't a pleasant experience,

00:14:48.643 --> 00:14:51.060
and I don't think I'll do short
stories again for a while.

00:14:51.060 --> 00:14:51.800
SPEAKER 1: OK.

00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:54.870
Stick with the Bobiverse
and then "Outland".

00:14:54.870 --> 00:14:58.280
What other works do you
have out there right now?

00:14:58.280 --> 00:15:02.200
You just mentioned that
you have at least one more

00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:04.160
book with Bob.

00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:06.800
DENNIS E. TAYLOR: Well, under
development, the Bender books.

00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:08.990
There's the three
Bobiverse books,

00:15:08.990 --> 00:15:11.240
there's "Outland",
"Singularity Trap", and then

00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:14.030
I'm working on books four and
five of the Bobiverse, four

00:15:14.030 --> 00:15:15.523
and five, "Search for Bender".

00:15:15.523 --> 00:15:16.190
SPEAKER 1: Cool.

00:15:16.190 --> 00:15:20.630
And then I have to ask, because
I'm a huge fan, Outland 2".

00:15:20.630 --> 00:15:22.173
When do we see it?

00:15:22.173 --> 00:15:24.590
DENNIS E. TAYLOR: That will
be the next thing I'll work on

00:15:24.590 --> 00:15:26.390
as soon as "Bender" is out.

00:15:26.390 --> 00:15:28.320
Again, I have an obligation.

00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:29.070
I have a contract.

00:15:29.070 --> 00:15:29.737
SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:15:29.737 --> 00:15:31.460
What's that pressure
like from the fans?

00:15:31.460 --> 00:15:34.310
Because I know I've
been on your blog

00:15:34.310 --> 00:15:36.140
back when you had
it active, and I

00:15:36.140 --> 00:15:37.790
was posting like
a petulant child,

00:15:37.790 --> 00:15:40.130
begging you to write more books.

00:15:40.130 --> 00:15:41.810
What's that pressure like?

00:15:41.810 --> 00:15:44.210
DENNIS E. TAYLOR: It
isn't really pressure.

00:15:44.210 --> 00:15:49.003
If you're a computer
programmer or have

00:15:49.003 --> 00:15:51.170
been a computer programmer,
you know about pressure.

00:15:51.170 --> 00:15:53.240
You know about bosses
breathing down your neck

00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:55.760
and showing up at your
cubicle every five minutes.

00:15:55.760 --> 00:15:56.510
Is it done yet?

00:15:56.510 --> 00:15:57.230
Is it done yet?

00:15:57.230 --> 00:15:59.840
Is it done yet?

00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:02.010
You develop a thick skin.

00:16:02.010 --> 00:16:06.260
I feel bad when somebody
asks me about "Bender"

00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:09.780
and I say, no, it's not
going to be ready then.

00:16:09.780 --> 00:16:10.280
I'm sorry.

00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:11.240
Another six months.

00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:16.502
But it's not pressure, I
think, the way you mean it.

00:16:16.502 --> 00:16:17.460
SPEAKER 1: Interesting.

00:16:17.460 --> 00:16:17.960
Yeah.

00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:21.298
I'll ask you more
about that later.

00:16:21.298 --> 00:16:23.090
We're probably going
to leave a lot of room

00:16:23.090 --> 00:16:26.660
for questions at the end because
this universe is very big

00:16:26.660 --> 00:16:29.900
and there's a lot of
interesting points.

00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:32.780
And hopefully, if you
haven't read his book,

00:16:32.780 --> 00:16:35.440
you'll have it read by
the end of this talk.

00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:37.950
I think you have 40 minutes.

00:16:37.950 --> 00:16:43.400
So I mean, first things first.

00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:45.920
Do you want your brain
sliced into a million pieces

00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:48.768
and turned into an AI?

00:16:48.768 --> 00:16:50.310
DENNIS E. TAYLOR:
My preference would

00:16:50.310 --> 00:16:52.800
be for physical immortality.

00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:56.310
So I'm holding out
for medical advances.

00:16:56.310 --> 00:16:58.605
But if that was my only
option, I'd go for it.

00:16:58.605 --> 00:16:59.700
SPEAKER 1: You would.

00:16:59.700 --> 00:17:02.673
And would it be you?

00:17:02.673 --> 00:17:03.840
We talked about this before.

00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:05.670
It's kind of an
interesting question.

00:17:05.670 --> 00:17:06.628
DENNIS E. TAYLOR: Yeah.

00:17:08.534 --> 00:17:10.470
And I'd like to go
back to the "Star Trek"

00:17:10.470 --> 00:17:13.500
episode where they created
Thomas Riker, the duplicate

00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:15.000
Riker.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.490
Is Thomas Riker Riker?

00:17:17.490 --> 00:17:21.599
He sure thinks so.

00:17:21.599 --> 00:17:23.490
But the original
Riker thinks so, too.

00:17:23.490 --> 00:17:25.650
But then everybody who
ever got transported

00:17:25.650 --> 00:17:26.869
thinks they're the original.

00:17:26.869 --> 00:17:30.660
And if you go by the
"Star Trek" explanation

00:17:30.660 --> 00:17:34.560
for the transporter,
they're not.

00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:36.507
They got killed long time ago.

00:17:36.507 --> 00:17:37.340
SPEAKER 1: OK, yeah.

00:17:37.340 --> 00:17:39.600
And I mean, for me, if
I were to look at it,

00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:45.018
I would think if you can control
that body, then that's you.

00:17:45.018 --> 00:17:46.560
So if there are two
different RIkers,

00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:49.230
I would suspect one can't
control the other's body.

00:17:49.230 --> 00:17:50.105
DENNIS E. TAYLOR: No.

00:17:50.105 --> 00:17:52.680
Yeah, each of them is
them, but each of them

00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:57.670
thinks that they're
the original Riker.

00:17:57.670 --> 00:18:00.630
In one case, in the case of
Thomas, he knows that he's not,

00:18:00.630 --> 00:18:02.130
I guess, because
of circumstances.

00:18:02.130 --> 00:18:05.782
But he sure feels
like the original guy.

00:18:05.782 --> 00:18:07.740
SPEAKER 1: And I don't
think this is a spoiler,

00:18:07.740 --> 00:18:10.380
but there's an instance where--

00:18:10.380 --> 00:18:11.700
I mean, maybe it is.

00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:13.410
You tell me.

00:18:13.410 --> 00:18:16.770
And then we'll just delete
the video off of YouTube.

00:18:16.770 --> 00:18:21.120
But Bob, in this
book, who's an AI,

00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:27.060
is able to create sandboxes,
areas of computer programming

00:18:27.060 --> 00:18:29.150
that are isolated
from anything else.

00:18:29.150 --> 00:18:34.260
And he puts characters in them
to be able to test things.

00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:39.650
Now when he deletes that
sandbox, did he just murder?

00:18:39.650 --> 00:18:41.740
DENNIS E. TAYLOR: Yeah.

00:18:41.740 --> 00:18:45.230
I kind of just sort of
sped past that point

00:18:45.230 --> 00:18:49.310
and tried not to
think of it too much.

00:18:49.310 --> 00:18:52.100
Technically, based on
the amount of explaining

00:18:52.100 --> 00:18:56.570
that I did in the book, he
is kind of deleting himself.

00:18:56.570 --> 00:19:00.140
But I'm going with the
idea that the sandbox

00:19:00.140 --> 00:19:05.480
Bob was a limited
edition version of him.

00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:06.500
Bob Light.

00:19:06.500 --> 00:19:07.705
SPEAKER 1: Bob Light, OK.

00:19:07.705 --> 00:19:10.080
DENNIS E. TAYLOR: That's my
story and I'm sticking to it.

00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:10.747
SPEAKER 1: Good.

00:19:10.747 --> 00:19:12.840
He could remove, somehow,
the sentience, maybe,

00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:15.330
from the sandbox version.

00:19:15.330 --> 00:19:16.540
OK, cool.

00:19:20.300 --> 00:19:28.370
So then what about an AI
like Bob amongst humans?

00:19:28.370 --> 00:19:32.680
What human rights
does the AI Bob have?

00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:36.340
DENNIS E. TAYLOR: Well,
in the book, none.

00:19:36.340 --> 00:19:41.560
And that's why I
created a theocracy.

00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:46.330
I've taken a lot of
flack from theists

00:19:46.330 --> 00:19:50.440
of various stripes on my
website and other places because

00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:54.430
of the negative portrayal
of faith and theocracies

00:19:54.430 --> 00:19:56.350
in general.

00:19:56.350 --> 00:19:59.590
Leaving aside the
question of whether I

00:19:59.590 --> 00:20:05.740
was accurate about them,
I needed a theocracy

00:20:05.740 --> 00:20:08.770
because that's the type
of institution that

00:20:08.770 --> 00:20:13.720
would look at Bob
as not being alive,

00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:16.270
not being sentient,
not having a soul.

00:20:16.270 --> 00:20:18.520
I mean, you have to believe
in the existence of a soul

00:20:18.520 --> 00:20:21.310
before you can say
somebody doesn't have one.

00:20:21.310 --> 00:20:23.110
So he has no rights.

00:20:23.110 --> 00:20:24.430
He can be bought and sold.

00:20:24.430 --> 00:20:25.952
He can be--

00:20:25.952 --> 00:20:27.660
SPEAKER 1: That explains
a lot, actually.

00:20:27.660 --> 00:20:28.660
Hopefully not a spoiler.

00:20:28.660 --> 00:20:32.290
But yeah, when I was reading,
I was kind of curious

00:20:32.290 --> 00:20:35.710
because it did very seem
strong to me, the theocracy

00:20:35.710 --> 00:20:41.170
aspect of it, and frankly,
slightly unrealistic.

00:20:41.170 --> 00:20:44.420
But it makes a lot
of sense that you

00:20:44.420 --> 00:20:48.755
would need that in order to take
away Bob's humanity, I guess.

00:20:48.755 --> 00:20:50.380
DENNIS E. TAYLOR:
Take away his rights.

00:20:50.380 --> 00:20:51.460
SPEAKER 1: Interesting.

00:20:51.460 --> 00:20:51.960
Interesting.

00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:55.990
And they're kind of irrelevant,
too, I mean, as an AI,

00:20:55.990 --> 00:21:00.150
because in some ways
he's all powerful.

00:21:00.150 --> 00:21:01.110
DENNIS E. TAYLOR: Yeah.

00:21:01.110 --> 00:21:04.470
He becomes all
powerful because he

00:21:04.470 --> 00:21:07.620
gets the constraints taken off.

00:21:07.620 --> 00:21:09.690
And that's because
of circumstances

00:21:09.690 --> 00:21:12.760
that we won't go into.

00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:16.290
But once the constraints on
his behavior are taken off,

00:21:16.290 --> 00:21:17.970
he's a free agent,
and then yeah, he

00:21:17.970 --> 00:21:21.940
can do whatever he
wants, and he does.

00:21:21.940 --> 00:21:23.108
SPEAKER 1: Yeah, he does.

00:21:23.108 --> 00:21:24.900
And that's kind of what
makes the book fun.

00:21:28.443 --> 00:21:30.360
One thing you were talking
to me about before,

00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:33.410
and this is kind of a
theme in sci-fi in general,

00:21:33.410 --> 00:21:37.800
is post-scarcity civilizations.

00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:40.267
So can you explain
what those are

00:21:40.267 --> 00:21:41.600
and what implications they have?

00:21:44.212 --> 00:21:45.920
DENNIS E. TAYLOR:
Well, the first problem

00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:48.740
with post-scarcity
civilizations is

00:21:48.740 --> 00:21:53.120
that, when people hear
about them, they think,

00:21:53.120 --> 00:21:55.580
I can have whatever
I want whenever I

00:21:55.580 --> 00:21:57.680
want to whatever degree I want.

00:21:57.680 --> 00:22:00.230
And that's not opposed
to scarcity civilization.

00:22:00.230 --> 00:22:05.990
That's a Utopia, but probably
also wish fulfillment.

00:22:05.990 --> 00:22:10.910
Post-scarcity civilization,
really, the only requirement

00:22:10.910 --> 00:22:15.410
is that all the
basics be provided.

00:22:15.410 --> 00:22:19.340
Nobody has to starve,
nobody has to go homeless.

00:22:19.340 --> 00:22:24.140
You can live a reasonable life
without ever lifting a finger.

00:22:24.140 --> 00:22:27.740
But that doesn't mean you're
going to be driving a Mercedes

00:22:27.740 --> 00:22:31.370
or living in a
mansion on the hill.

00:22:31.370 --> 00:22:34.840
The nature of reality is
that there's always going

00:22:34.840 --> 00:22:38.660
to be scarcity of some kind.

00:22:38.660 --> 00:22:40.803
Everybody can't have
everything they want.

00:22:40.803 --> 00:22:42.720
SPEAKER 1: So you're
living is taking care of,

00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:46.570
but your desires are
still very constrained.

00:22:46.570 --> 00:22:48.960
And is that what would
drive, then, people to action

00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:52.610
in a post-scarcity society?

00:22:52.610 --> 00:22:54.980
DENNIS E. TAYLOR: I think so.

00:22:54.980 --> 00:22:57.740
It's been dealt with
in a number of books,

00:22:57.740 --> 00:23:00.200
but usually the basic
idea is that there's

00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:02.180
some kind of
universal basic income

00:23:02.180 --> 00:23:07.320
and guarantees of basic
necessities and so forth.

00:23:07.320 --> 00:23:12.090
And if you just want to
live at that level, great.

00:23:12.090 --> 00:23:12.590
That's good.

00:23:12.590 --> 00:23:16.520
In fact, Asimov does that, and
we were talking about Asimov

00:23:16.520 --> 00:23:18.350
earlier.

00:23:18.350 --> 00:23:24.710
If you want to buy a Mercedes
or the big mansion on the hill,

00:23:24.710 --> 00:23:25.853
you have to put some--

00:23:25.853 --> 00:23:27.020
SPEAKER 1: You have to work.

00:23:27.020 --> 00:23:28.640
DENNIS E. TAYLOR: You have to
put some elbow grease in there.

00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:30.660
You have to find a
use for yourself.

00:23:30.660 --> 00:23:34.030
You have to contribute.

00:23:34.030 --> 00:23:34.790
SPEAKER 1: Yes.

00:23:34.790 --> 00:23:38.065
So in these societies,
then, you're not just--

00:23:38.065 --> 00:23:40.190
yeah, because I was worrying
about that, especially

00:23:40.190 --> 00:23:43.640
in terms of Bob,
who can do whatever

00:23:43.640 --> 00:23:45.140
he wants in certain ways--

00:23:47.780 --> 00:23:51.560
what meaning life, if you
can call it that, for an AI,

00:23:51.560 --> 00:23:57.760
would have once it's eternal
and capabilities are endless.

00:24:01.550 --> 00:24:06.200
DENNIS E. TAYLOR: The thing is,
that type of question hinges

00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:07.700
on your personality.

00:24:07.700 --> 00:24:12.080
It depends on what drives you.

00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:14.610
One of the--

00:24:14.610 --> 00:24:17.130
I don't want to call
it cliches, but a trope

00:24:17.130 --> 00:24:20.070
in fiction, and
maybe in real life,

00:24:20.070 --> 00:24:22.800
is the person who
works all their life,

00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:26.580
retires, and is
dead in six months.

00:24:26.580 --> 00:24:28.920
Or they spend all their
time in front of the TV set

00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:30.360
or something like that.

00:24:30.360 --> 00:24:33.590
Those are people who defined
themselves by their job.

00:24:33.590 --> 00:24:37.170
They lived to work.

00:24:37.170 --> 00:24:40.950
If you're the type of
person who works to live,

00:24:40.950 --> 00:24:45.300
once the financial
constraints are taken off,

00:24:45.300 --> 00:24:47.610
there's lots of stuff
to do; in Bob's case,

00:24:47.610 --> 00:24:53.280
explore or be a
buttinski and get

00:24:53.280 --> 00:24:55.660
involved in the Daltons
and stuff like that.

00:24:55.660 --> 00:25:02.190
But he's not limited
by need for a job.

00:25:02.190 --> 00:25:04.230
He's able to define
his own goals.

00:25:04.230 --> 00:25:06.600
And I think if you
can do that, you'll

00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:09.512
be fine in any
post-scarcity society.

00:25:09.512 --> 00:25:10.470
SPEAKER 1: Interesting.

00:25:10.470 --> 00:25:12.240
As long as you have
something to work for.

00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:19.310
You have a lot of specific
details about solar systems

00:25:19.310 --> 00:25:21.990
and galaxies in this book.

00:25:21.990 --> 00:25:24.060
Did you research all
that just for this book,

00:25:24.060 --> 00:25:28.185
or was that something you were
already very familiar with?

00:25:28.185 --> 00:25:30.060
DENNIS E. TAYLOR: I was
an amateur astronomer

00:25:30.060 --> 00:25:32.010
when I was a teenager.

00:25:32.010 --> 00:25:36.610
I actually built my own
reflector telescope,

00:25:36.610 --> 00:25:38.410
ground the mirror,
the whole bit.

00:25:38.410 --> 00:25:40.830
And boy, is that boring.

00:25:40.830 --> 00:25:41.790
Hour upon hour.

00:25:44.940 --> 00:25:49.560
But that's back in the
dim mists of prehistory.

00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:51.860
We didn't know as much
astronomy in those days.

00:25:51.860 --> 00:25:54.810
But I've kept up with it.

00:25:54.810 --> 00:25:59.970
I read the magazines and the
articles on Phys.org and stuff

00:25:59.970 --> 00:26:00.530
like that.

00:26:00.530 --> 00:26:04.840
And the only thing I
really had to research

00:26:04.840 --> 00:26:09.520
was specific stellar systems.

00:26:09.520 --> 00:26:11.830
I needed a stellar system
that's 10 light years away.

00:26:11.830 --> 00:26:14.620
OK, that's Epsilon
Eridani, Delta Eridani's

00:26:14.620 --> 00:26:16.600
over there, and so forth.

00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:20.727
But yeah, that's
just detail work.

00:26:20.727 --> 00:26:21.310
SPEAKER 1: OK.

00:26:21.310 --> 00:26:23.170
So all that detail
work is accurate,

00:26:23.170 --> 00:26:25.130
then, for the most
part, in your book.

00:26:25.130 --> 00:26:25.630
Wow.

00:26:25.630 --> 00:26:30.490
So how accurate are you
with the actual composition

00:26:30.490 --> 00:26:31.930
of the planets in those systems?

00:26:31.930 --> 00:26:34.940
DENNIS E. TAYLOR: Oh,
that's total fabrication.

00:26:34.940 --> 00:26:35.940
SPEAKER 1: Good to know.

00:26:35.940 --> 00:26:38.320
Good to know.

00:26:38.320 --> 00:26:42.075
And for instance, what
is a an Oort cloud?

00:26:45.010 --> 00:26:46.360
How did you know about that?

00:26:46.360 --> 00:26:47.985
DENNIS E. TAYLOR:
Well, that's actually

00:26:47.985 --> 00:26:52.298
discussed quite regularly
in the scientific articles

00:26:52.298 --> 00:26:52.840
and so forth.

00:26:52.840 --> 00:26:56.020
You've got the planets
going out from the sun

00:26:56.020 --> 00:26:59.610
all the way to Pluto, which
may or may not be a planet.

00:26:59.610 --> 00:27:00.528
Then you've got--

00:27:00.528 --> 00:27:02.320
SPEAKER 1: That's messed
up, what they did.

00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:03.820
DENNIS E. TAYLOR: Then
you got the Kuiper belt,

00:27:03.820 --> 00:27:04.912
which is outside of that.

00:27:04.912 --> 00:27:06.370
And then you've
got the Oort cloud,

00:27:06.370 --> 00:27:12.010
which is this huge cloud
of mostly empty space.

00:27:12.010 --> 00:27:18.400
But small, icy bodies and stuff
like that circling the sun.

00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:20.920
And that may extend,
according to some people,

00:27:20.920 --> 00:27:23.390
up to a light year or more out.

00:27:23.390 --> 00:27:25.145
It's very diffuse.

00:27:25.145 --> 00:27:26.770
SPEAKER 1: And you
get all this is just

00:27:26.770 --> 00:27:31.200
from growing up, learning
about all these things.

00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:32.132
Interesting.

00:27:35.800 --> 00:27:38.920
You said you had a thick
skin from the process when

00:27:38.920 --> 00:27:42.917
fans like me are
constantly pestering you.

00:27:42.917 --> 00:27:45.250
Do you ever let your fans be
part of the writing process

00:27:45.250 --> 00:27:45.750
at all?

00:27:48.937 --> 00:27:51.020
DENNIS E. TAYLOR: There
are legal aspects to that.

00:27:53.690 --> 00:28:01.235
If a fan makes a suggestion and
you take it and run with it,

00:28:01.235 --> 00:28:05.420
you could get sued for
part of the royalties.

00:28:05.420 --> 00:28:06.420
That was my idea.

00:28:06.420 --> 00:28:08.360
You ran with my idea.

00:28:08.360 --> 00:28:14.270
It's just a variation on the
"You Stole My Song" lawsuit.

00:28:14.270 --> 00:28:22.310
So in the Facebook group,
Fans of the Bobiverse,

00:28:22.310 --> 00:28:26.570
it has been made very clear
in the rules of the group

00:28:26.570 --> 00:28:31.970
that if you bring up any kind
of an idea, it's public domain.

00:28:31.970 --> 00:28:35.600
You have no ownership of
anything you say in that group.

00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:39.125
So just in case somebody does
say something that makes me go,

00:28:39.125 --> 00:28:43.130
hmmm, they don't have any
kind of legal claim to it.

00:28:43.130 --> 00:28:46.160
And I said early on
that if somebody started

00:28:46.160 --> 00:28:50.750
discussing details of some kind
of plot or something like that,

00:28:50.750 --> 00:28:53.450
I would basically unsubscribe.

00:28:53.450 --> 00:28:54.200
SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:56.045
So you kind of have to
put the earmuffs on.

00:28:56.045 --> 00:28:57.920
DENNIS E. TAYLOR: Have
to put the blinkers on

00:28:57.920 --> 00:29:00.345
and everything like
that, and just not look.

00:29:00.345 --> 00:29:01.470
SPEAKER 1: OK, interesting.

00:29:01.470 --> 00:29:04.730
I didn't know what that
world was like until now.

00:29:04.730 --> 00:29:08.690
DENNIS E. TAYLOR: Well, that's
why fanfic is not well thought

00:29:08.690 --> 00:29:11.270
of, if you will,
in forums and stuff

00:29:11.270 --> 00:29:16.244
like that because it tends to be
all about copyright violation.

00:29:16.244 --> 00:29:18.110
SPEAKER 1: Interesting.

00:29:18.110 --> 00:29:19.820
Are there legal
implications, then,

00:29:19.820 --> 00:29:22.237
for someone who's writing fan
fiction as well because then

00:29:22.237 --> 00:29:24.090
they're kind of stealing your--

00:29:24.090 --> 00:29:25.882
DENNIS E. TAYLOR: The
thing about copyright

00:29:25.882 --> 00:29:28.680
is you have to defend
it or you lose it.

00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:35.730
When companies sue some guy,
outside of hope for something,

00:29:35.730 --> 00:29:38.940
it's not because they're
big, bad companies.

00:29:38.940 --> 00:29:41.820
But, generally speaking, you
have to defend your copyright

00:29:41.820 --> 00:29:43.350
or you lose it.

00:29:45.970 --> 00:29:50.940
So when fanfic authors start
writing in an author's universe

00:29:50.940 --> 00:29:54.180
without permission, the
author has a choice of--

00:29:54.180 --> 00:29:56.010
or usually it's the
publisher, of course,

00:29:56.010 --> 00:29:58.798
because they're the ones who
have the legal obligation

00:29:58.798 --> 00:29:59.340
and so forth.

00:29:59.340 --> 00:30:05.190
But they have to go after them,
or it's implied permission

00:30:05.190 --> 00:30:06.767
to continue to do so.

00:30:06.767 --> 00:30:07.350
SPEAKER 1: OK.

00:30:07.350 --> 00:30:11.850
So my idea that I posted on your
blog about Micronesia taking

00:30:11.850 --> 00:30:14.040
over Alaska with
six-year-olds in "Outland"--

00:30:14.040 --> 00:30:16.880
DENNIS E. TAYLOR: That wasn't
going to happen anyway.

00:30:16.880 --> 00:30:17.880
SPEAKER 1: That's tough.

00:30:17.880 --> 00:30:21.420
Well, so I'm just going to
ask a couple random questions,

00:30:21.420 --> 00:30:23.190
and then we'll pass
it off to the audience

00:30:23.190 --> 00:30:25.392
and hopefully they'll have
some questions for you.

00:30:25.392 --> 00:30:26.850
First of all, whose
brain would you

00:30:26.850 --> 00:30:30.730
like to have mapped into a
computer besides your own?

00:30:30.730 --> 00:30:32.430
DENNIS E. TAYLOR: Einstein.

00:30:32.430 --> 00:30:34.140
I know it's a cliche response.

00:30:34.140 --> 00:30:37.040
But hey, it's also
a very true one.

00:30:37.040 --> 00:30:39.660
SPEAKER 1: What do you think
he would do with that eternity

00:30:39.660 --> 00:30:40.797
that he had?

00:30:40.797 --> 00:30:42.880
DENNIS E. TAYLOR: He would
make copies of himself,

00:30:42.880 --> 00:30:45.840
and they would all get together
and start working on theories.

00:30:45.840 --> 00:30:47.340
SPEAKER 1: Mathematics
and theories.

00:30:51.360 --> 00:30:56.150
What about-- there's a lot
of notions of existentialism

00:30:56.150 --> 00:31:01.650
in this book, especially between
the eternal nature of an AI

00:31:01.650 --> 00:31:04.500
versus the ephemeral nature--
you use that word a lot

00:31:04.500 --> 00:31:05.130
in your book.

00:31:05.130 --> 00:31:07.297
I think I probably learned
it from your book, even--

00:31:07.297 --> 00:31:08.490
of humans.

00:31:08.490 --> 00:31:12.450
So did you ponder on
existentialism a lot

00:31:12.450 --> 00:31:15.180
in that regard?

00:31:15.180 --> 00:31:17.850
DENNIS E. TAYLOR: Well,
it's not new thoughts.

00:31:17.850 --> 00:31:21.210
I didn't have to start
thinking about it for the book

00:31:21.210 --> 00:31:24.460
specifically, although I
did a little bit of research

00:31:24.460 --> 00:31:30.190
on some of the
philosophical implications.

00:31:30.190 --> 00:31:34.570
But yeah, the whole question
of the existence and self

00:31:34.570 --> 00:31:36.920
and stuff like that.

00:31:36.920 --> 00:31:40.110
Well, everything comes back
to "Star Trek", doesn't it?

00:31:40.110 --> 00:31:40.923
Transporters?

00:31:40.923 --> 00:31:41.590
SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:31:41.590 --> 00:31:43.200
So tell us about the
transporter question.

00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:44.890
Did you already mention
that in this talk?

00:31:44.890 --> 00:31:47.223
DENNIS E. TAYLOR: I mentioned
it in passing once before,

00:31:47.223 --> 00:31:49.570
but for those who don't
know, the original idea

00:31:49.570 --> 00:31:51.880
of the transporter
in "Star Trek"

00:31:51.880 --> 00:31:56.290
was that it disassembles you
and scans you, and then creates

00:31:56.290 --> 00:32:00.820
a duplicate of you over there.

00:32:00.820 --> 00:32:04.870
In TNG they tried to
tweak that a little bit,

00:32:04.870 --> 00:32:07.330
and they put in the
containment field

00:32:07.330 --> 00:32:09.970
and tried to say that
you're actually transporting

00:32:09.970 --> 00:32:11.050
all the molecules over.

00:32:11.050 --> 00:32:13.600
But it was too little too late.

00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:16.600
The basic idea is that
you're destroyed here,

00:32:16.600 --> 00:32:19.000
and a copy of you is created
over there that thinks

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:21.790
it's you, but you're dead.

00:32:21.790 --> 00:32:24.732
SPEAKER 1: It's tantamount
to painless dying.

00:32:24.732 --> 00:32:25.440
It's interesting.

00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:28.090
And so then I guess
you have to ask

00:32:28.090 --> 00:32:35.080
the question of is your own
consciousness irrelevant to you

00:32:35.080 --> 00:32:39.170
as long as your memory
and your actions go on?

00:32:39.170 --> 00:32:42.012
But I'd say most people would
probably be against that.

00:32:42.012 --> 00:32:42.970
DENNIS E. TAYLOR: Yeah.

00:32:42.970 --> 00:32:47.620
Well, the philosophical
discussion usually

00:32:47.620 --> 00:32:49.660
comes down to continuity.

00:32:49.660 --> 00:32:53.980
If you can show continuity
all the way through your life,

00:32:53.980 --> 00:32:56.170
then it's you.

00:32:56.170 --> 00:33:00.310
One of the thought
experiments that's done is--

00:33:00.310 --> 00:33:02.620
and I mention this
briefly in the book--

00:33:02.620 --> 00:33:06.040
is if you had a stroke
and part of your brain

00:33:06.040 --> 00:33:07.960
died, and they were
able to replace it

00:33:07.960 --> 00:33:11.870
with an artificial neuron
or a set of neurons,

00:33:11.870 --> 00:33:18.280
so now you're, like, 5%
artificial, are you still you?

00:33:18.280 --> 00:33:21.488
So now you have another stroke,
and-- oh, wait a second.

00:33:21.488 --> 00:33:22.780
This was in "Singularity Trap".

00:33:22.780 --> 00:33:25.630
That's why you're
looking at me funny.

00:33:25.630 --> 00:33:27.730
So now you have another stroke.

00:33:27.730 --> 00:33:29.380
They replace more brain.

00:33:29.380 --> 00:33:31.600
Now you're 10% artificial.

00:33:31.600 --> 00:33:33.010
Are you still you?

00:33:33.010 --> 00:33:34.360
You keep this up.

00:33:34.360 --> 00:33:36.460
Now you're 90% artificial.

00:33:36.460 --> 00:33:38.590
Someday you're 100% artificial.

00:33:38.590 --> 00:33:40.360
Are you still you?

00:33:40.360 --> 00:33:44.350
And the thinking
is that, if you can

00:33:44.350 --> 00:33:47.650
draw a continuous
four-dimensional line

00:33:47.650 --> 00:33:52.000
from the old you to the
current you without any breaks,

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:52.500
it's you.

00:33:55.010 --> 00:33:59.770
And the problem with the
transporter is there's a cut.

00:33:59.770 --> 00:34:02.620
SPEAKER 1: What about when you
take that brain that, once it's

00:34:02.620 --> 00:34:08.280
been completely segmented over
to 100%, and then you copy it?

00:34:08.280 --> 00:34:11.159
What's the case then?

00:34:11.159 --> 00:34:15.360
DENNIS E. TAYLOR: Well, if
you go with the philosophy,

00:34:15.360 --> 00:34:16.830
the copy is not you.

00:34:16.830 --> 00:34:19.962
It's a copy of you because
there's no continuity.

00:34:19.962 --> 00:34:22.170
SPEAKER 1: Even if you copied
it and then shuffled it

00:34:22.170 --> 00:34:24.679
under some cups, and you
wouldn't know which is which?

00:34:24.679 --> 00:34:25.320
DENNIS E. TAYLOR:
Well, you might not

00:34:25.320 --> 00:34:27.512
know which is the copy of
you, but one of them is.

00:34:27.512 --> 00:34:28.429
SPEAKER 1: One is you.

00:34:28.429 --> 00:34:29.320
OK.

00:34:29.320 --> 00:34:31.445
Yeah, I thought that was
interesting about the Bobs

00:34:31.445 --> 00:34:35.800
because there's this appeal to
the eternal nature of an AI.

00:34:35.800 --> 00:34:39.010
There's this appeal to, like,
oh, I want to live forever.

00:34:39.010 --> 00:34:42.170
I would love to be an AI.

00:34:42.170 --> 00:34:44.159
But that's constantly
stifled by the idea

00:34:44.159 --> 00:34:46.199
that you can never
actually be that AI.

00:34:46.199 --> 00:34:49.330
Your memories will be,
something like you will be,

00:34:49.330 --> 00:34:50.760
but you will never be.

00:34:50.760 --> 00:34:51.960
DENNIS E. TAYLOR: Yeah.

00:34:51.960 --> 00:34:52.732
I'd still do it.

00:34:52.732 --> 00:34:53.940
SPEAKER 1: You'd still do it.

00:34:53.940 --> 00:34:55.770
Why would you do it?

00:34:55.770 --> 00:34:58.692
DENNIS E. TAYLOR: Just the idea
that there's a me out there.

00:34:58.692 --> 00:34:59.900
SPEAKER 1: Reassuring to you.

00:34:59.900 --> 00:35:00.858
DENNIS E. TAYLOR: Yeah.

00:35:00.858 --> 00:35:04.710
And even if it isn't
me me, it would still

00:35:04.710 --> 00:35:09.730
have my goals and plans and
preferences and so forth.

00:35:09.730 --> 00:35:11.890
And it would still do
what I would have done.

00:35:11.890 --> 00:35:14.940
SPEAKER 1: So you'd be happy to
see the future being affected

00:35:14.940 --> 00:35:17.370
by your desires and goals.

00:35:17.370 --> 00:35:19.320
DENNIS E. TAYLOR: Yeah.

00:35:19.320 --> 00:35:21.720
SPEAKER 1: Good answer.

00:35:21.720 --> 00:35:24.810
Then let's see.

00:35:27.750 --> 00:35:31.937
So with both "Outland"
and "We Are Legion"--

00:35:31.937 --> 00:35:33.520
and I haven't read
"Singularity Trap".

00:35:33.520 --> 00:35:36.000
I'm excited to still get
to read at least one more

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:38.560
book from you--

00:35:38.560 --> 00:35:40.630
there is an infinite
number of worlds you

00:35:40.630 --> 00:35:42.910
can create with these books.

00:35:42.910 --> 00:35:47.240
There's nearly infinite with "We
Are Legion", it's exploration.

00:35:47.240 --> 00:35:53.310
I guess "Outland" same thing,
but exploring differently.

00:35:53.310 --> 00:35:56.850
How far do you think
you'll take these books?

00:35:56.850 --> 00:35:59.400
DENNIS E. TAYLOR: I
will keep writing novels

00:35:59.400 --> 00:36:05.850
as long as the audience
remains interested.

00:36:05.850 --> 00:36:08.460
I have no trouble coming
up with new ideas.

00:36:08.460 --> 00:36:13.510
I have an ideas list that's up
around 150 items at this point.

00:36:13.510 --> 00:36:16.530
So I'm never going to get
through that in my lifetime

00:36:16.530 --> 00:36:19.570
unless that medical
breakthrough--

00:36:19.570 --> 00:36:21.270
SPEAKER 1: Or the AI.

00:36:21.270 --> 00:36:24.300
DENNIS E. TAYLOR: Or
the AI thing, yeah.

00:36:24.300 --> 00:36:27.930
But yeah, it really
comes down to popularity.

00:36:27.930 --> 00:36:33.150
If it starts to get stale and
people stop buying the books,

00:36:33.150 --> 00:36:35.950
then I'll cut it off and
go on to something else.

00:36:35.950 --> 00:36:37.560
But otherwise, yeah.

00:36:37.560 --> 00:36:39.280
Quite happy to keep going.

00:36:39.280 --> 00:36:41.340
SPEAKER 1: Well, that's
very reassuring for me

00:36:41.340 --> 00:36:44.020
because I can't
get enough of them.

00:36:44.020 --> 00:36:44.520
Great.

00:36:44.520 --> 00:36:46.650
Well, that's all the
questions I had for you.

00:36:46.650 --> 00:36:49.150
Let's pass some questions
off to the audience. a Matt,

00:36:49.150 --> 00:36:50.880
would you mind
tossing round the mic?

00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:53.127
AUDIENCE: First of all,
as far as spoilers go,

00:36:53.127 --> 00:36:55.710
I know the ship has sailed, but
the entire outline of the book

00:36:55.710 --> 00:36:56.787
is up on that slide?

00:36:56.787 --> 00:36:57.620
SPEAKER 1: Oh, yeah.

00:36:57.620 --> 00:36:58.395
AUDIENCE: OK, cool.

00:36:58.395 --> 00:37:00.853
SPEAKER 1: It wouldn't mean
much to you unless you read it.

00:37:00.853 --> 00:37:02.290
AUDIENCE: Fair enough.

00:37:02.290 --> 00:37:06.090
SPEAKER 1: At least, that's
what I think is accurate.

00:37:06.090 --> 00:37:09.120
AUDIENCE: I had a question
about, I guess, philosophy.

00:37:09.120 --> 00:37:12.570
You seem to have some
experience there.

00:37:12.570 --> 00:37:16.800
Who have you read, or
who are your influences,

00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:19.800
both science fiction writers
and if there's anybody,

00:37:19.800 --> 00:37:22.350
contemporary philosophers.

00:37:22.350 --> 00:37:25.445
DENNIS E. TAYLOR: In terms
of philosophers, I haven't--

00:37:28.020 --> 00:37:32.910
I mean, I have listened
to "Plato's Republic"

00:37:32.910 --> 00:37:36.677
and I've read some of the
philosophy of Socrates

00:37:36.677 --> 00:37:37.510
and stuff like that.

00:37:37.510 --> 00:37:41.940
But mostly, it's
research oriented.

00:37:41.940 --> 00:37:44.700
I'm a very pragmatic person.

00:37:44.700 --> 00:37:47.130
So I tend to read what I
need to read in order to get

00:37:47.130 --> 00:37:50.040
to where I want to get to.

00:37:50.040 --> 00:37:53.220
I love "The Good Place", though.

00:37:53.220 --> 00:37:56.520
If anybody has not watched
that, it is well worth watching,

00:37:56.520 --> 00:37:57.180
very well done.

00:38:01.460 --> 00:38:02.540
Yeah.

00:38:02.540 --> 00:38:03.920
I've actually
downloaded a couple

00:38:03.920 --> 00:38:08.570
of Audible books on philosophy
specifically for the research

00:38:08.570 --> 00:38:12.860
that I did on the Bobiverse
and on "Singularity Trap".

00:38:12.860 --> 00:38:17.990
In terms of authors, I think
my two biggest influences

00:38:17.990 --> 00:38:24.820
are Heinlein and
Niven, although there's

00:38:24.820 --> 00:38:27.940
a large smattering of
Campbell and Hamilton

00:38:27.940 --> 00:38:29.793
and everybody else
like that, too.

00:38:29.793 --> 00:38:30.460
SPEAKER 1: Nice.

00:38:30.460 --> 00:38:32.770
Mine are Orson Scott Card
and Dennis E. Taylor.

00:38:35.630 --> 00:38:36.890
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:38:36.890 --> 00:38:41.270
To pick up on that,
you're an avid reader.

00:38:41.270 --> 00:38:44.300
You have been an avid reader of
science fiction all your life

00:38:44.300 --> 00:38:46.970
since you were young.

00:38:46.970 --> 00:38:51.290
Do you find yourself sometimes
taking too much of ideas

00:38:51.290 --> 00:38:54.200
that you've read in the
past, and you find yourself

00:38:54.200 --> 00:38:56.690
incorporating them and you have
to stop and say, what can I

00:38:56.690 --> 00:39:00.200
do to make it my own?

00:39:00.200 --> 00:39:01.880
DENNIS E. TAYLOR:
That actually isn't

00:39:01.880 --> 00:39:06.200
as much of a problem in
general as most people think.

00:39:06.200 --> 00:39:13.610
As they say in the writing
industry, ideas are cheap.

00:39:16.130 --> 00:39:20.750
It's the execution of the
idea that makes the book.

00:39:20.750 --> 00:39:25.930
"The Martian" is just
"Robinson Crusoe", right?

00:39:25.930 --> 00:39:29.820
In fact, you can probably--

00:39:29.820 --> 00:39:34.470
well, if you look at any
half dozen science fiction

00:39:34.470 --> 00:39:36.000
or thriller movies--

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:41.010
"Deep Star Six",
"Leviathan", "Alien"--

00:39:41.010 --> 00:39:43.350
they're all the same theme.

00:39:43.350 --> 00:39:45.390
Bunch of people get
stuck in a limited space

00:39:45.390 --> 00:39:49.260
with a monster that's
eating them one at a time.

00:39:49.260 --> 00:39:53.520
It's a very simple idea,
but how you execute it.

00:39:53.520 --> 00:39:55.290
"Deep Star Six", "Alien".

00:39:57.833 --> 00:39:59.500
AUDIENCE: I actually
have two questions.

00:39:59.500 --> 00:40:02.010
One is about the
audiobook itself.

00:40:02.010 --> 00:40:02.580
I loved it.

00:40:02.580 --> 00:40:05.850
I actually listened to all
your books while I was biking

00:40:05.850 --> 00:40:07.770
and the narrator
reporter did a fantastic

00:40:07.770 --> 00:40:10.980
job, where all of these things
I can still remember them.

00:40:10.980 --> 00:40:12.540
So my question
is, how much input

00:40:12.540 --> 00:40:16.500
does author have that goes
into the narration of the book?

00:40:16.500 --> 00:40:19.330
And you also mentioned you were
editing your book for Audible.

00:40:19.330 --> 00:40:21.390
I'm wondering what kind
of editing happens there,

00:40:21.390 --> 00:40:22.932
and if you had that
in your mind when

00:40:22.932 --> 00:40:26.670
you were writing that book,
The Bobiverse universe.

00:40:26.670 --> 00:40:28.630
My second question is around--

00:40:28.630 --> 00:40:30.240
and I apologize for
using the word--

00:40:30.240 --> 00:40:31.862
the books would feel
a little rushed.

00:40:31.862 --> 00:40:32.820
There's a lot of stuff.

00:40:32.820 --> 00:40:35.755
Like you could have
made it a ten-book arc.

00:40:35.755 --> 00:40:37.380
There's a lot of
stuff like the Madeira

00:40:37.380 --> 00:40:39.600
or the Chinese contingent
first contact story that

00:40:39.600 --> 00:40:41.040
would be great to know about.

00:40:41.040 --> 00:40:42.510
Is there any plan
for a collection

00:40:42.510 --> 00:40:44.370
of short stories in
the Bobiverse universe

00:40:44.370 --> 00:40:47.040
that talks about those things,
even the fall of civilization

00:40:47.040 --> 00:40:48.860
and those kind of stuff?

00:40:48.860 --> 00:40:50.015
DENNIS E. TAYLOR: OK.

00:40:50.015 --> 00:40:51.390
SPEAKER 1: That's
a big question.

00:40:51.390 --> 00:40:52.980
DENNIS TAYLOR: Yeah.

00:40:52.980 --> 00:40:56.645
Well, let's answer
the second one first.

00:40:56.645 --> 00:40:58.020
I think the reason
that the books

00:40:58.020 --> 00:41:01.730
would feel rushed really
comes down to my inexperience

00:41:01.730 --> 00:41:02.730
when I was writing them.

00:41:06.140 --> 00:41:08.960
Inexperienced
writers will either

00:41:08.960 --> 00:41:13.190
tend to underwrite or
overwrite massively.

00:41:13.190 --> 00:41:18.530
And part of learning the craft
is getting the mix right.

00:41:18.530 --> 00:41:23.220
I'm an underwriter, massive
underwriter by nature.

00:41:23.220 --> 00:41:26.030
My first draft of a book
will be 40,000 words

00:41:26.030 --> 00:41:29.750
and then I have to figure
out how to fill it in

00:41:29.750 --> 00:41:31.200
to make it 80,000 words.

00:41:31.200 --> 00:41:34.985
And it usually consists
of things like dialogue.

00:41:38.330 --> 00:41:42.590
But yeah, it really comes
down to inexperience.

00:41:42.590 --> 00:41:46.610
If I rewrote these, I would
put a lot more detail in.

00:41:46.610 --> 00:41:50.090
I would spend a lot more
time on some of the subplots.

00:41:50.090 --> 00:41:54.140
And as far as short
stories and stuff

00:41:54.140 --> 00:41:56.220
like that, yeah, that's
definitely a plan.

00:41:56.220 --> 00:41:58.250
I've got novel ideas.

00:41:58.250 --> 00:42:02.150
I've got short story ideas,
and they'll all come together.

00:42:04.700 --> 00:42:11.620
To answer the
first question, I'm

00:42:11.620 --> 00:42:14.170
sure that a big author
like John Scalzi

00:42:14.170 --> 00:42:18.160
could demand a particular
narrator if he wanted to

00:42:18.160 --> 00:42:20.290
and get away with it.

00:42:20.290 --> 00:42:24.280
As a newb, I had no
say, although I suppose

00:42:24.280 --> 00:42:27.700
if I'd kicked up a fuss--

00:42:27.700 --> 00:42:28.390
well, maybe not.

00:42:28.390 --> 00:42:29.360
I don't know.

00:42:29.360 --> 00:42:31.600
Anyway, I had no idea who
Ray Porter was anyway,

00:42:31.600 --> 00:42:34.570
so I was in no position
to do any kicking.

00:42:34.570 --> 00:42:39.820
As it turns out, I'm very
glad they picked him.

00:42:39.820 --> 00:42:44.170
Before he started on
the recordings, though,

00:42:44.170 --> 00:42:48.880
Ray contacted me, and he asked
me how some of these characters

00:42:48.880 --> 00:42:51.130
sounded to me in my head.

00:42:51.130 --> 00:42:56.190
And Guppy is obvious.

00:42:56.190 --> 00:42:59.980
He sounds like Akbar.

00:42:59.980 --> 00:43:04.990
Butterworth I heard sounding
like Colonel Fowler in "Chicken

00:43:04.990 --> 00:43:06.750
Run".

00:43:06.750 --> 00:43:09.000
And Ray pulled it off.

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:10.770
I mean, he really pulled it off.

00:43:10.770 --> 00:43:16.710
Homer sounded to me like Bill
Murray in "Ghostbusters",

00:43:16.710 --> 00:43:17.820
for instance.

00:43:17.820 --> 00:43:19.020
Stuff like that.

00:43:19.020 --> 00:43:24.040
Most of them, though,
he just went with it.

00:43:24.040 --> 00:43:27.270
AUDIENCE: So you mentioned
overwriting and underwriting

00:43:27.270 --> 00:43:29.910
as one of the lessons you
learned in the process.

00:43:29.910 --> 00:43:31.260
Is there anything else?

00:43:31.260 --> 00:43:34.230
Like overall, has your
process for writing

00:43:34.230 --> 00:43:36.970
changed as you've gotten
more experience with it?

00:43:39.500 --> 00:43:43.170
DENNIS E. TAYLOR: There are
so many things that change,

00:43:43.170 --> 00:43:46.300
or that you improve
on as you get better.

00:43:46.300 --> 00:43:51.840
One of the things that I
find irritating, actually,

00:43:51.840 --> 00:43:55.770
about my first book,
especially now,

00:43:55.770 --> 00:44:00.570
is the degree to which Bob
shrugs, grins, rolls his eyes,

00:44:00.570 --> 00:44:03.150
and stuff like that.

00:44:03.150 --> 00:44:08.010
Those are beats
versus dialogue tags.

00:44:08.010 --> 00:44:13.140
Dialogue tags are he said, he
replied, he asked, she shouted,

00:44:13.140 --> 00:44:14.700
stuff like that.

00:44:14.700 --> 00:44:19.950
Beats are where you perform an
action that doesn't necessarily

00:44:19.950 --> 00:44:22.770
relate to what you're actually
saying, but establishes

00:44:22.770 --> 00:44:24.260
who's talking.

00:44:24.260 --> 00:44:27.920
Now, Dennis sat down, then
turned to look at the audience.

00:44:27.920 --> 00:44:29.130
Hi, I'm me.

00:44:31.770 --> 00:44:36.910
My repertoire for
beats was limited.

00:44:36.910 --> 00:44:39.810
I hope I've improved
on that over time.

00:44:39.810 --> 00:44:41.670
But yeah, that's another thing.

00:44:41.670 --> 00:44:44.880
If I was writing it
again from scratch,

00:44:44.880 --> 00:44:48.230
I would do a lot
better with that.

00:44:48.230 --> 00:44:48.830
All right.

00:44:48.830 --> 00:44:50.150
Well, if There's
no more questions--

00:44:50.150 --> 00:44:51.192
we got one more question.

00:44:53.690 --> 00:44:56.130
AUDIENCE: Any idea when the
Bender books are coming out?

00:44:56.130 --> 00:44:59.863
Is Bender the bad
guy in these ones?

00:44:59.863 --> 00:45:01.280
DENNIS E. TAYLOR:
I had originally

00:45:01.280 --> 00:45:07.160
said that I would be trying to
publish them by summer 2019.

00:45:07.160 --> 00:45:13.700
Right now I'm hoping to finish
them by the end of summer 2019.

00:45:13.700 --> 00:45:16.850
I have always said
that my writing suffers

00:45:16.850 --> 00:45:19.987
during snowboarding
season, and this year I

00:45:19.987 --> 00:45:21.570
did a lot of
snowboarding at Whistler.

00:45:21.570 --> 00:45:24.830
So my writing really suffered,
so I'm behind schedule.

00:45:27.482 --> 00:45:29.940
SPEAKER 1: OK, we've got one
more question way in the back.

00:45:32.700 --> 00:45:34.060
Tech guy.

00:45:34.060 --> 00:45:36.450
AUDIENCE: So when
you started writing,

00:45:36.450 --> 00:45:40.140
what did that do to
your habits of reading?

00:45:40.140 --> 00:45:42.090
DENNIS E. TAYLOR: Oh, god.

00:45:42.090 --> 00:45:43.170
Yeah.

00:45:43.170 --> 00:45:47.280
This is a common problem
with writers, actually.

00:45:47.280 --> 00:45:53.562
Once you start learning the
techniques, story arcs, all

00:45:53.562 --> 00:45:55.020
of the things that
go into writing,

00:45:55.020 --> 00:45:58.710
you become very aware of them.

00:45:58.710 --> 00:46:00.150
It's just like--

00:46:00.150 --> 00:46:02.400
SPEAKER 1: Seeing the
sausage being made?

00:46:02.400 --> 00:46:04.200
Seeing the sausage being made?

00:46:04.200 --> 00:46:07.900
DENNIS E. TAYLOR: Yeah, you're
seeing the sausage being made.

00:46:07.900 --> 00:46:11.970
I now find myself much
less tolerant of books,

00:46:11.970 --> 00:46:14.010
and for that matter,
movies and TV

00:46:14.010 --> 00:46:17.790
shows simply because I can see
what the writer is trying to do

00:46:17.790 --> 00:46:20.940
and I can see when they
don't quite pull it off.

00:46:20.940 --> 00:46:24.375
And it can be eye-rolling.

00:46:24.375 --> 00:46:25.250
SPEAKER 1: All right.

00:46:25.250 --> 00:46:25.970
Thank you.

00:46:25.970 --> 00:46:28.650
Well, we really
appreciate having you on.

00:46:28.650 --> 00:46:31.970
For those of you
who are interested,

00:46:31.970 --> 00:46:33.527
I work with the
Talks team at Google.

00:46:33.527 --> 00:46:35.360
Feel free to approach
me afterwards and talk

00:46:35.360 --> 00:46:38.420
about bringing your favorite
authors up on stage.

00:46:38.420 --> 00:46:41.440
