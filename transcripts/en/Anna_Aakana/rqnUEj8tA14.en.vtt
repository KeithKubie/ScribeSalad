00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.760
 My personal life is not exactly vulgar 

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:05.220
 But it is certainly this Mim 

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:08.500
 I'm okay. 

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:10.520
 Yeah. 

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:15.780
 My personal life has recently exploded that is true and it has been difficult. 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.120
 In fact many people tried to communicate with me 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:19.660
 seriously 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:21.060
 Are you fine? 

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:24.860
 Um, your tweets on Twitter recently have .. 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.220
 It aroused my concern 

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:28.980
 No, 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.380
 No, in case you were wondering 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:31.560
 Definitely not okay. 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.000
 But if your life goes off or turns, what can you do? 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.960
 Frankly, all I was doing was drinking, 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.380
 Crying ugly and trying to distract myself from this whole mess 

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:42.300
 Because the only thing that can help me is time. 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:43.440
 a lot of time. 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.060
 So if you find that your life has also collapsed 

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:47.400
 Here are some things you can do. 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.500
 First you definitely want to rely on friends and family. 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.140
 Everyone needs a support group 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:55.640
 And I was relying on my group. 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:56.800
 Much. 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.500
 It can be ten o'clock at night, when I feel the beginning of the cold cold feelings of loneliness and despair 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:05.100
 Then I start sending written texts to everyone I know. 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:15.900
 I am very lucky because I have amazing friends 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.460
 I can talk to them sometimes at three in the morning 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.560
 They listen to me and give me advice. 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:23.240
 thanks friends! 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.560
 The next thing you want to do is go to your therapist (psychologist) 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.300
 If you do not receive treatment, I advise you to start. 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:32.560
 Because it / they can give you a lot of valuable advice to help you in the tragedy that is your current life. 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:36.160
 It seems like all you're doing to deal with this situation is to drink. 

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:37.280
 And crying. 

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:40.980
 And .. that's good .. but I think you should also start incorporating adaptive mechanisms .. 

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:44.320
 More healthy in the process of your grief 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:48.200
 Such as making sure you're getting enough sleep, keeping exercise and having a healthy diet - 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.600
 I went to three nightclubs this month alone 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:51.820
 Well this .. 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:55.300
 If I did not listen to music or podcasts in the car, the calm would be quite dark 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:58.800
 Immediately burst out crying. 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:00.080
 Hahaha 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:01.500
 Well this is ... 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.280
 Yes, I feel that I am broken, as if everything is fueled by fire 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.040
 As if the house would fall at any moment 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:10.100
 Well why do not you take a deep breath for me now? 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:12.900
 Deep rudeness 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:15.860
 Ha ha ha! 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:20.020
 Depending on the extent of your life, you will pass through these stages for some time. 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:23.860
 In the end, you'll need to start taking care of yourself and rebuilding your life. 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.900
 I'm not at that stage yet, I'm still in despair. 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.400
 But I've definitely started taking steps to get to that stage. 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:48.600
 For example, I joined a new pilates department because I need more endorphins now than ever before. 

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:52.640
 I followed a new hobby of 'bowling' and rock climbing so I could go out with my friends 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:57.320
 And adopted a new cat! 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:58.120
 Just joking. 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:02.280
 But seriously at this stage, who cares how much of a cat I have .. I will die alone. 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:07.020
 But if your life is in a state of collapse, encourage you to try to 'embrace' the worst part of it. 

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:08.940
 For example you can cry in a night club .. 

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:13.000
 But at least you're in a night club, trying to have a fun time. 

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:15.860
 You can go out with your friends and end up falling on the stairs 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:18.360
 And entering the men's bath and then want to die in the extreme embarrassment. 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:21.460
 But at least you are with your friends, trying to have fun. 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:26.760
 You can try writing a video script for YouTube and start feeling hopeless 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:31.520
 And crying too, but still writing a screenplay for a video in an effort to have fun 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:35.720
 Just because your life breaks down does not mean that you have to miss your desire to live. 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:39.500
 I'm okana, this is not a cry to help
