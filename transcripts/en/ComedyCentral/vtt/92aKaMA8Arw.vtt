(Forrest)
There is a genuine little person
who works in my office building.

00:00:04.103 --> 00:00:08.708
I took in every aspect
of his stature.

00:00:08.741 --> 00:00:12.745
- Can I help you?
- No.

00:00:12.778 --> 00:00:14.580
(Forrest)
I've never considered
what it would be like

00:00:14.613 --> 00:00:16.516
to live in a world
where everything is designed

00:00:16.549 --> 00:00:19.185
for people much bigger
than you.

00:00:22.455 --> 00:00:25.091
But I was about to find out.

00:00:28.427 --> 00:00:29.695
- Hey, Mr. MacNeil.
- Hi.

00:00:29.728 --> 00:00:31.164 size:78% position:39%
Your giant ruler arrived.

00:00:31.197 --> 00:00:33.066 align:start size:41% position:59%
Oh. Well, no.

00:00:33.099 --> 00:00:37.437 align:end position:100%
Now, Josh, that's a normal-sized
ruler, one foot long.

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:41.174 align:start position:0%
But it's--it's so big.

00:00:41.207 --> 00:00:43.409 align:start size:69% position:31%
No, it's normal-sized.

00:00:43.442 --> 00:00:45.111 align:start size:31% position:69%
I'm small.

00:00:45.144 --> 00:00:46.446
Oh.

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:48.514 align:start size:13% position:88%
Yes.

00:00:48.547 --> 00:00:49.782
(Forrest)
From the beginning,
I found it to be

00:00:49.815 --> 00:00:52.752
strangely disorienting.

00:00:52.785 --> 00:00:56.189
Even everyday tasks
became more difficult.

00:00:56.222 --> 00:00:58.691 align:start size:34% position:66%
Oh, Ah! Ah!

00:00:58.724 --> 00:01:01.160
(Forrest)
And the people in my life,
even my loved ones,

00:01:01.193 --> 00:01:04.097
discriminated against me
constantly.

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:07.366 align:start position:0%
Forrest,
what are you doing?

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:09.202
I'm brushing my teeth.

00:01:09.235 --> 00:01:11.804
Or am I too small for that?

00:01:11.837 --> 00:01:13.539 align:start position:0%
No.

00:01:13.572 --> 00:01:17.610 size:75% position:38%
You're not small at all.

00:01:17.643 --> 00:01:19.145
(Forrest)
Though I hated to admit it,

00:01:19.178 --> 00:01:20.646
my father was right.

00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:23.749
I had not fully committed
to this review.

00:01:23.782 --> 00:01:26.086
I was not small at all.

00:01:31.524 --> 00:01:33.192 align:start size:53% position:47%
Hey, Mr. MacNeil.

00:01:33.225 --> 00:01:35.194 align:end position:100%
I got your normal-sized
breakfast.

00:01:35.227 --> 00:01:37.396
That is not
a normal-sized breakfast.

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:39.398
That's a gigantic breakfast.
Get rid of it, please.

00:01:39.431 --> 00:01:41.400
And we're getting rid of
all the other nonsense upstairs.

00:01:41.433 --> 00:01:42.702
And come on off those stilts.

00:01:42.735 --> 00:01:44.370 size:78% position:39%
It's time to get serious.

00:01:44.403 --> 00:01:46.239 align:start size:38% position:63%
Okay, sorry.

00:01:48.807 --> 00:01:51.511
You might want
to watch your head there.

00:01:51.544 --> 00:01:54.147
(Josh)
It's kind of a bummer, 'cause,
like, I just got used to these.

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.749
(Forrest)
Mm-hmm.

00:01:56.782 --> 00:01:59.585
I'd found a VHS tape
in my dad's video collection

00:01:59.618 --> 00:02:02.288
of a charming little man
named<i> Dorf on Golf.</i>

00:02:02.321 --> 00:02:04.457
He is played
by the actor Tim Conway

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:07.326
and bears an amusing resemblance
to Hitler.

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:11.330
A new plan was born.

00:02:11.363 --> 00:02:13.332
Passing through the world
of the normals,

00:02:13.365 --> 00:02:15.701
I was subjected
to constant discrimination

00:02:15.734 --> 00:02:17.403
and blatant rudeness.

00:02:17.436 --> 00:02:20.173 align:start size:25% position:75%
[scoffs]

00:02:20.206 --> 00:02:21.474
Hey, hey.

00:02:21.507 --> 00:02:23.142
I'm crossing here.

00:02:23.175 --> 00:02:25.278
[horn honks]
- Move it, jerk-off.

00:02:25.311 --> 00:02:26.779
- What's the matter?
- Get out of the road.

00:02:26.812 --> 00:02:28.447
It takes the time it takes
to walk across the street.

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.416
[horn honks]

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:32.285
(Forrest)
Sadly, I found even those
from my own community

00:02:32.318 --> 00:02:35.421
didn't accept me,
so deep was their self-loathing.

00:02:35.454 --> 00:02:37.790 align:start position:0%
Can I help you?

00:02:37.823 --> 00:02:40.026 align:start size:9% position:91%
No.
