still pretty terrified of the place and
 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.390

and so you can see my my sleeping bag
here I used to in the middle of the

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530
here I used to in the middle of the
 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.050
here I used to in the middle of the
night I'd wrap myself up in the sleeping

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060
night I'd wrap myself up in the sleeping
 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.469
night I'd wrap myself up in the sleeping
bag as tight as I could to avoid the

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:32.479
bag as tight as I could to avoid the
 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:34.789

right by the fire so inevitably the
 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:42.499
right by the fire so inevitably the
sleeping bag would come off of me and

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509
sleeping bag would come off of me and
 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.300
sleeping bag would come off of me and
I'd be exposed to the world and three

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310
I'd be exposed to the world and three
 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.039

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020
I'm looking around thinking gosh a snake
 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.600
I'm looking around thinking gosh a snake
could crawl in here any time you know

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610
could crawl in here any time you know
 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.480

this isn't exactly an airtight house and

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:55.490
this isn't exactly an airtight house and
 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:57.709
this isn't exactly an airtight house and
sure enough in the middle of that very

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719
sure enough in the middle of that very
 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.420

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600
the middle of the night and there's this
 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.600
the middle of the night and there's this
thing across me that's this big around

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610
thing across me that's this big around
 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.760
thing across me that's this big around
just just right across my chest like

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770
just just right across my chest like
 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.330
just just right across my chest like
this and so I freaked out obviously and

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340
this and so I freaked out obviously and
 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.900
this and so I freaked out obviously and
and I grabbed it with my left hand and I

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910
and I grabbed it with my left hand and I
 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.820
and I grabbed it with my left hand and I
throw it off of me but as I throw

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830
throw it off of me but as I throw
 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.130
throw it off of me but as I throw
it I roll with it and it's completely

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140
it I roll with it and it's completely
 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:17.450
it I roll with it and it's completely
dark I can't see what's happening but

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:17.460
dark I can't see what's happening but
 

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:19.100
dark I can't see what's happening but
clearly I'm wrapped up with this thing

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110
clearly I'm wrapped up with this thing
 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:20.900
clearly I'm wrapped up with this thing
somehow so but I get it pinned down with

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910
somehow so but I get it pinned down with
 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:23.930
somehow so but I get it pinned down with
my left hand and then I try to move my

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940
my left hand and then I try to move my
 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:25.220
my left hand and then I try to move my
right arm so I can pin it down with my

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230
right arm so I can pin it down with my
 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:26.900
right arm so I can pin it down with my
right arm and I can't move my right arm

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910
right arm and I can't move my right arm
 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.150
right arm and I can't move my right arm
and it's about this time I realized I've

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160
and it's about this time I realized I've
 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:30.740
and it's about this time I realized I've
actually pinned down my own right arm

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750
actually pinned down my own right arm
 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:37.070
actually pinned down my own right arm
like this and and what had happened was

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080
like this and and what had happened was
 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.290
like this and and what had happened was
my arm had fallen asleep and then it was

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300
my arm had fallen asleep and then it was
 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:43.280
my arm had fallen asleep and then it was
across me like this and so so there

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290
across me like this and so so there
 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:46.280
across me like this and so so there
actually was no snake and and so then I

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290
actually was no snake and and so then I
 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:49.340
actually was no snake and and so then I
had to explain with really with hand

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350
had to explain with really with hand
 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:50.720
had to explain with really with hand
gestures and things because I doesn't

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730
gestures and things because I doesn't
 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.820
gestures and things because I doesn't
speak to language what was going on and

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830
speak to language what was going on and
 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:54.920
speak to language what was going on and
for the next couple months I would walk

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930
for the next couple months I would walk
 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:56.690
for the next couple months I would walk
around these villages and I just hear

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700
around these villages and I just hear
 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.160
around these villages and I just hear
they I didn't understand the language

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170
they I didn't understand the language
 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:59.390
they I didn't understand the language
would be like blah blah blah blah blah

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400
would be like blah blah blah blah blah
 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.220
would be like blah blah blah blah blah
night here see these arm gestures and

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230
night here see these arm gestures and
 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:04.880
night here see these arm gestures and
then laughter and it sounds really funny

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890
then laughter and it sounds really funny
 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:07.910
then laughter and it sounds really funny
but it was actually devastating and and

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920
but it was actually devastating and and
 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.130
but it was actually devastating and and
I realized I had to recreate myself

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140
I realized I had to recreate myself
 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:11.930

over the years that I lived there it was

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:26.070
over the years that I lived there it was
 

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:28.759
over the years that I lived there it was
I was doing it in a totally different

high school I I grew up in a very

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709
high school I I grew up in a very
 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:33.290
high school I I grew up in a very
mediated world a very like

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:33.300
mediated world a very like
 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:35.330
mediated world a very like
media-saturated world and this is a

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340
media-saturated world and this is a
 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.610
media-saturated world and this is a
world with no media and it really made

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620
world with no media and it really made
 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:39.290
world with no media and it really made
me think about how different it is to

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:39.300
me think about how different it is to
 

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:41.479
me think about how different it is to
shape your identity in a world based

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:41.489
shape your identity in a world based
 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:42.850

relationships versus a mediated world
and then over the last 10 years that

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760
and then over the last 10 years that
 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:48.979
and then over the last 10 years that
I've been going back and forth there

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:48.989
I've been going back and forth there
 

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:50.479
I've been going back and forth there
something else happened and that was the

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:50.489
something else happened and that was the
 

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:52.160
something else happened and that was the
introduction of writing in the form of

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.170
introduction of writing in the form of
 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:55.490
introduction of writing in the form of
maps censuses law books and Bibles and

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500
maps censuses law books and Bibles and
 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.500
maps censuses law books and Bibles and
this had tremendous effects on the

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510
this had tremendous effects on the
 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:59.120
this had tremendous effects on the
culture far beyond what I could have

00:03:59.120 --> 00:03:59.130
culture far beyond what I could have
 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:01.040
culture far beyond what I could have
ever predicted how did somebody told me

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:01.050
ever predicted how did somebody told me
 

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:02.900

writing was just around the corner for

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:02.910
writing was just around the corner for
 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:04.729
writing was just around the corner for
them and this made me think that media

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:04.739
them and this made me think that media
 

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:06.470
them and this made me think that media
are not just tools they're not just

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:06.480
are not just tools they're not just
 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:08.240
are not just tools they're not just
means of communication but media

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250
means of communication but media
 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:10.789
means of communication but media
actually mediate relationships and so

00:04:10.789 --> 00:04:10.799
actually mediate relationships and so
 

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:13.310
actually mediate relationships and so
when media change relationships change

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:13.320
when media change relationships change
 

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:15.350
when media change relationships change
and that brings up some interesting

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:15.360
and that brings up some interesting
 

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:19.039
and that brings up some interesting
implications for where we are at here in

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:19.049
implications for where we are at here in
 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:21.080
implications for where we are at here in

this is a screenshot from one of the the
winning video and they asked the two

00:04:59.149 --> 00:04:59.159
winning video and they asked the two
 

00:04:59.159 --> 00:05:00.559
winning video and they asked the two
young guys who did this these are just

00:05:00.559 --> 00:05:00.569
young guys who did this these are just
 

00:05:00.569 --> 00:05:02.540

amateur filmmakers they asked him how

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:02.550
amateur filmmakers they asked him how
 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:03.770
amateur filmmakers they asked him how
much did it cost you to produce this

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:03.780
much did it cost you to produce this
 

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:05.149

video and they said twelve dollars and

00:05:05.149 --> 00:05:05.159
video and they said twelve dollars and
 

00:05:05.159 --> 00:05:07.399
video and they said twelve dollars and
79 cents which is roughly the cost of

00:05:07.399 --> 00:05:07.409
79 cents which is roughly the cost of
 

00:05:07.409 --> 00:05:08.749
79 cents which is roughly the cost of
three bags of Doritos that they had to

00:05:08.749 --> 00:05:08.759
three bags of Doritos that they had to
 

00:05:08.759 --> 00:05:11.209
three bags of Doritos that they had to
break during the filming and that's a

00:05:11.209 --> 00:05:11.219
break during the filming and that's a
 

00:05:11.219 --> 00:05:12.559
break during the filming and that's a
pretty good savings it's roughly a

00:05:12.559 --> 00:05:12.569
pretty good savings it's roughly a
 

00:05:12.569 --> 00:05:13.939
pretty good savings it's roughly a
million dollars in savings so I don't

00:05:13.939 --> 00:05:13.949
million dollars in savings so I don't
 

00:05:13.949 --> 00:05:18.230
million dollars in savings so I don't
have the exact math but the USA Today

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:18.240
have the exact math but the USA Today
 

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:19.760
have the exact math but the USA Today
did a study on it and found that it was

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:19.770
did a study on it and found that it was
 

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:21.730

well but it ended up costing you know
 

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:29.270
well but it ended up costing you know
it's 2.6 million dollars just to get it

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:29.280
it's 2.6 million dollars just to get it

during the during the Superbowl so if
you're doing the math that's roughly 2.6

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:36.180
you're doing the math that's roughly 2.6
 

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:38.629
you're doing the math that's roughly 2.6
million dollars and they asked him why

something like this and this you might
 

00:09:35.850 --> 00:09:38.179
something like this and this you might
call user-generated distribution so now

old media does but does it all by
 

00:09:47.970 --> 00:09:51.079
old media does but does it all by
harnessing the users actions and then

my video was starting to make its rounds

00:10:13.249 --> 00:10:13.259
my video was starting to make its rounds
 

00:10:13.259 --> 00:10:14.749
my video was starting to make its rounds
and lots of people were blogging about

and so this is when I got really excited

00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:19.230
and so this is when I got really excited
 

00:10:19.230 --> 00:10:20.720
and so this is when I got really excited
and I called my wife in and we were both

00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:20.730

hoping that it would get to number one

00:10:24.439 --> 00:10:24.449
hoping that it would get to number one
 

00:10:24.449 --> 00:10:26.150

before the Superbowl because we knew the

00:10:27.379 --> 00:10:27.389
Super Bowl commercials would just wash
 

00:10:27.389 --> 00:10:30.259
Super Bowl commercials would just wash
it out but amazingly by noon that day it

00:10:30.259 --> 00:10:30.269

over a month after that

00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:37.050
over a month after that
 

00:10:37.050 --> 00:10:39.829
over a month after that
so really became this phenomenon online

00:10:39.829 --> 00:10:39.839
so really became this phenomenon online
 

00:10:39.839 --> 00:10:41.990
so really became this phenomenon online
and it's it's amazing then to see that

00:10:41.990 --> 00:10:42.000
and it's it's amazing then to see that
 

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:43.610
and it's it's amazing then to see that
this user-generated landscape these

this user-generated landscape these
 

00:10:43.620 --> 00:10:44.960
this user-generated landscape these
millions of people working together

00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:44.970
millions of people working together
 

00:10:44.970 --> 00:10:46.999
millions of people working together
could actually spread this video to

00:10:46.999 --> 00:10:47.009
could actually spread this video to
 

00:10:47.009 --> 00:10:48.650
could actually spread this video to
millions of people to have a bit talked

00:10:48.650 --> 00:10:48.660
millions of people to have a bit talked
 

00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:51.199
millions of people to have a bit talked
about thousands of times and so that

00:10:51.199 --> 00:10:51.209
about thousands of times and so that

this new landscape what's interesting

00:10:52.639 --> 00:10:52.649
this new landscape what's interesting
 

00:10:52.649 --> 00:10:54.889
this new landscape what's interesting
about it is not just the technology but

00:10:54.889 --> 00:10:54.899
about it is not just the technology but
 

00:10:54.899 --> 00:10:56.870
about it is not just the technology but
that it's actually bringing people

00:10:56.870 --> 00:10:56.880
that it's actually bringing people
 

00:10:56.880 --> 00:10:59.059
that it's actually bringing people
together to collaborate in new ways so

00:10:59.059 --> 00:10:59.069
together to collaborate in new ways so
 

00:10:59.069 --> 00:11:01.100
together to collaborate in new ways so
that at the center of this is not just

00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:01.110
that at the center of this is not just
 

00:11:01.110 --> 00:11:03.079
that at the center of this is not just
the technology but it's us and that

00:11:03.079 --> 00:11:03.089
the technology but it's us and that
 

00:11:03.089 --> 00:11:04.879
the technology but it's us and that
means this is as much a social or

00:11:04.879 --> 00:11:04.889
means this is as much a social or
 

00:11:04.889 --> 00:11:06.410
means this is as much a social or
cultural revolution as it is a

00:11:06.410 --> 00:11:06.420
cultural revolution as it is a
 

00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:08.569
cultural revolution as it is a
technological one which is why we need

00:11:08.569 --> 00:11:08.579
technological one which is why we need
 

00:11:08.579 --> 00:11:10.369
technological one which is why we need
to rethink all of these things and

00:11:10.369 --> 00:11:10.379
to rethink all of these things and
 

00:11:10.379 --> 00:11:13.069
to rethink all of these things and
especially what I'm very interested in

00:11:13.069 --> 00:11:13.079
especially what I'm very interested in
 

00:11:13.079 --> 00:11:15.679
especially what I'm very interested in
is rethinking this so this is my class

00:11:15.679 --> 00:11:15.689
is rethinking this so this is my class
 

00:11:15.689 --> 00:11:19.129
is rethinking this so this is my class

these huge classrooms and
and what's interesting about this new

00:11:22.980 --> 00:11:22.990
and what's interesting about this new
 

00:11:22.990 --> 00:11:26.190
and what's interesting about this new

the big eye-opener for me was you know

00:12:39.780 --> 00:12:39.790
the big eye-opener for me was you know
 

00:12:39.790 --> 00:12:41.190
the big eye-opener for me was you know
if you think about what good learning

this classroom when I started teaching
 

00:12:57.460 --> 00:12:59.730
this classroom when I started teaching
they're worth questions like this how

00:12:59.730 --> 00:12:59.740
they're worth questions like this how
 

00:12:59.740 --> 00:13:02.010
they're worth questions like this how
many points is this worth how long does

this paper need to be what do we need to
know for this test and ultimately I view

00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:06.370
know for this test and ultimately I view
 

00:13:06.370 --> 00:13:07.980

students are really struggling to find
 

00:13:09.550 --> 00:13:10.890
students are really struggling to find
the significance of the learning they're

00:13:10.890 --> 00:13:10.900
the significance of the learning they're
 

00:13:10.900 --> 00:13:12.240
the significance of the learning they're
playing a different game they're playing

something of significance and importance

00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:18.250
something of significance and importance
 

00:13:18.250 --> 00:13:20.250
something of significance and importance
so it's no wonder that a lot of our

00:13:20.250 --> 00:13:20.260
so it's no wonder that a lot of our
 

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:21.570
so it's no wonder that a lot of our
students would be tuning out of class

you see this this is a big problem

00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:22.930
you see this this is a big problem
 

00:13:22.930 --> 00:13:25.079
you see this this is a big problem
around America right now that students

00:13:25.079 --> 00:13:25.089
around America right now that students
 

00:13:25.089 --> 00:13:26.460
around America right now that students
are facebooking through their classes

environment which we view as very
 

00:13:47.050 --> 00:13:48.480
environment which we view as very
disruptive to the classroom

disruptive to the classroom
 

00:13:48.490 --> 00:13:50.189
disruptive to the classroom
can actually be disruptive in a good way

00:13:50.189 --> 00:13:50.199
can actually be disruptive in a good way
 

00:13:50.199 --> 00:13:51.900
can actually be disruptive in a good way
it can remind us that these walls don't

00:13:51.900 --> 00:13:51.910
it can remind us that these walls don't
 

00:13:51.910 --> 00:13:54.090
it can remind us that these walls don't
matter and we can start rethinking how

00:13:54.090 --> 00:13:54.100
matter and we can start rethinking how
 

00:13:54.100 --> 00:13:55.410

our students are doing their research

00:13:55.410 --> 00:13:55.420
our students are doing their research

our students are doing their research
collaborating and publishing and when

00:13:57.660 --> 00:13:57.670
collaborating and publishing and when
 

00:13:57.670 --> 00:13:58.949

research on anything anytime anywhere
and you can publish your material out to

00:14:06.780 --> 00:14:06.790
and you can publish your material out to
 

00:14:06.790 --> 00:14:09.210
and you can publish your material out to
anybody anytime anywhere and so what we

00:14:09.210 --> 00:14:09.220
anybody anytime anywhere and so what we
 

00:14:09.220 --> 00:14:11.250
anybody anytime anywhere and so what we
did was we just cranked up a Google

00:14:11.250 --> 00:14:11.260
did was we just cranked up a Google
 

00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:12.930
did was we just cranked up a Google
document this is one of our first

00:14:12.930 --> 00:14:12.940
document this is one of our first
 

00:14:12.940 --> 00:14:14.579
document this is one of our first
experiments with this kind of thing and

00:14:14.579 --> 00:14:14.589
experiments with this kind of thing and
 

00:14:14.589 --> 00:14:16.740
experiments with this kind of thing and
this allowed 200 students to edit the

00:14:16.740 --> 00:14:16.750
this allowed 200 students to edit the
 

00:14:16.750 --> 00:14:19.740
this allowed 200 students to edit the
same document at once and we focused on

00:14:19.740 --> 00:14:19.750
same document at once and we focused on
 

00:14:19.750 --> 00:14:21.960
same document at once and we focused on
education at first the the classroom

00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:21.970
education at first the the classroom
 

00:14:21.970 --> 00:14:25.139
education at first the the classroom
itself so after about 400 edits made by

00:14:25.139 --> 00:14:25.149
itself so after about 400 edits made by
 

00:14:25.149 --> 00:14:27.509
itself so after about 400 edits made by
all these 200 students we had a really

00:14:27.509 --> 00:14:27.519
all these 200 students we had a really
 

00:14:27.519 --> 00:14:29.370
all these 200 students we had a really
interesting document put together which

00:14:29.370 --> 00:14:29.380
interesting document put together which
 

00:14:29.380 --> 00:14:30.990
interesting document put together which
we published in many different forms

00:14:30.990 --> 00:14:31.000
we published in many different forms
 

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.210
we published in many different forms
including a video we put on YouTube that

here and then the next thing we did was
 

00:14:44.529 --> 00:14:45.809
here and then the next thing we did was
we thought well gosh there's so much

00:14:45.809 --> 00:14:45.819
we thought well gosh there's so much
 

00:14:45.819 --> 00:14:47.220
we thought well gosh there's so much
expertise here if we could just somehow

the intelligence that's out there
 

00:14:55.750 --> 00:14:57.240
the intelligence that's out there
somehow we could get all together

00:14:57.240 --> 00:14:57.250
somehow we could get all together
 

00:14:57.250 --> 00:14:59.370
somehow we could get all together
working on the same thing we turned our

00:14:59.370 --> 00:14:59.380
working on the same thing we turned our
 

00:14:59.380 --> 00:15:00.900
working on the same thing we turned our
attention to the study of YouTube we did

00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:00.910
attention to the study of YouTube we did
 

00:15:00.910 --> 00:15:03.180
attention to the study of YouTube we did
an anthropological study of YouTube that

00:15:03.180 --> 00:15:03.190
an anthropological study of YouTube that
 

00:15:03.190 --> 00:15:05.189
an anthropological study of YouTube that
also became a big hit we made a

00:15:05.189 --> 00:15:05.199
also became a big hit we made a
 

00:15:05.199 --> 00:15:07.019
also became a big hit we made a
documentary about it over a million

00:15:07.019 --> 00:15:07.029
documentary about it over a million
 

00:15:07.029 --> 00:15:08.850

then one of the things I'm most proud of
 

00:15:15.819 --> 00:15:18.600
then one of the things I'm most proud of
is we take a classroom like this 200 to

00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:18.610
is we take a classroom like this 200 to
 

00:15:18.610 --> 00:15:21.360
is we take a classroom like this 200 to
400 students each student is assigned to

and then we divide up the world into 20

00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:39.850
and then we divide up the world into 20
 

00:15:39.850 --> 00:15:41.850
and then we divide up the world into 20
different world areas and the students

00:15:41.850 --> 00:15:41.860
different world areas and the students

purpose of all this is that it changes
 

00:16:39.010 --> 00:16:41.010
purpose of all this is that it changes
the question from what do we need to

00:16:41.010 --> 00:16:41.020
the question from what do we need to
 

00:16:41.020 --> 00:16:42.780
the question from what do we need to
know for this test to the much more

00:16:42.780 --> 00:16:42.790
know for this test to the much more
 

00:16:42.790 --> 00:16:44.490
know for this test to the much more
important what do we need to know for

00:16:44.490 --> 00:16:44.500
important what do we need to know for
 

00:16:44.500 --> 00:16:47.970
important what do we need to know for
this test thanks
