00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:25.990
Born from cultures we can only read about
and making fun of customs we don’t always

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:30.810
understand, many of the world’s oldest jokes,
to a modern audience, simply aren’t that

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:31.810
funny.

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:35.480
That said, humans being humans, with the oldest
joke that has survived through today, it would

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:40.640
appear little has changed in the interim-
it, naturally, being a fart joke.

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:46.489
To wit, recorded on a Sumerian tablet somewhere
between 1900 and 2300 BC, the first known

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:48.760
joke is as follow:

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:53.870
Something which has never occurred since time
immemorial; a young woman did not fart on

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:55.049
her husband’s lap.

00:00:55.049 --> 00:01:00.140
The second oldest documented joke moves away
from potty humor in favor of a sex, recorded

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:06.500
about 1600 BC on the Westcar Papyrus: “How
do you entertain a bored pharaoh?

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:11.280
You sail a boatload of young women dressed
only in fishing nets down the Nile and urge

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.990
the pharaoh to go catch a fish.”

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:18.820
The third oldest known joke was recorded on
a Babylonian tablet dating to about 1500 BC

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:23.880
and, given some of the context is missing,
is interesting today mostly for its construction,

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.120
being the oldest known “Yo’ Momma” joke…

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:27.840
(We haven’t really changed all that much,
have we?):

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.450
…of your mother is by the one who has intercourse
with her.

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:32.560
What/who is it?

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:33.560
*No answer*

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.890
From this point, occasional surviving jokes
pop up here and there, and even references

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:39.260
to no longer surviving joke books.

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:43.450
The first known of these is a collection of
jokes from a social club in Athens that was

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:51.070
reportedly compiled at the request of Philip
the Great of Macedon (382–336 BC), but unfortunately

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:52.470
has been lost to history.

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.620
Several hundred years later (and a few more
known references to lost joke books in the

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:01.390
interim), we have a Greek joke book whose
contents have survived to today.

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:06.430
That book, Philogelos, (full book here) dates
to around the 4th or 5th century AD and includes

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:12.310
265 jokes, a selection of which shows a wide
range of humor and, in some cases, how little

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:16.480
basic joke themes have changed over the centuries:

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.879
An intellectual was told by someone: “your
beard is now coming in.”

00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:22.230
So he went to the rear-entrance and waited
for it.

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.290
Another intellectual asked what he was doing.

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:28.400
Once he heard the whole story, he said: “I’m
not surprised that people say we lack common

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:29.400
sense.

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.620
How do you know that it’s not coming in
by the other gate?”

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.530
Someone needled a jokester: “I had your
wife, without paying a dime.”

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:40.260
He replied: “It’s my duty as a husband
to couple with such a monstrosity.

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:41.810
What made you do it?”

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:46.110
A man with bad breath asked his wife: “Madame,
why do you hate me?

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:48.830
And she replied: “Because you love me.”

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:52.319
A young man invited into his home frisky old
women.

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:56.700
He said to his servants: “Mix a drink for
one, and have sex with the other, if she wants

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:57.700
to.”

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:59.460
The women spoke up as one: “I’m not thirsty.”

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:02.630
A misogynist was sick, at death’s door.

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:06.220
When his wife said to him, “If anything
bad happens to you, I’ll hang myself,”

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:11.480
he looked up at her and said: “Do me the
favor while I’m still alive.”

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:15.849
An intellectual during the night ravished
his grandmother and for this got a beating

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:17.110
from his father.

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:20.150
The intellectual complained: “You’ve been
mounting my mother for a long time, without

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:22.250
suffering any consequences from me.

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:27.090
And now you’re mad that you found me screwing
your mother for the first time ever!?”

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:30.880
Consulting a hotheaded doctor, a fellow says:
“Professor, I’m unable to lie down or

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:33.620
stand up; I can’t even sit down.”

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:38.070
The doctor responds: “I guess the only thing
left is to hang yourself.”

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:40.819
A student dunce went swimming and almost drowned.

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:46.320
So now he swears he’ll never get into water
until he’s really learned to swim.

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:49.879
A misogynist stood in the marketplace and
announced: “I’m putting my wife up for

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:50.940
sale, tax-free!”

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:55.010
When people asked him why, he said: “So
the authorities will impound her.”

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:59.410
Finally, there are a few riddles from the
10th century AD Anglo-Saxons recorded in the

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:04.470
Exeter Codex that are generally regarded as
the first known English jokes (albeit Old

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:06.849
English) due to their double entendre nature.

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:11.530
For example: “What hangs at a man’s thigh
and wants to poke the hole that it’s often

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:12.599
poked before?

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:14.640
Answer: A key.”

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:15.640
And the similar themed:

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:20.239
I am a wondrous creature for women in expectation,
a service for neighbors.

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:23.710
I harm none of the citizens except my slayer
alone.

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:27.090
My stem is erect, I stand up in bed, hairy
somewhere down below.

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:31.600
A very comely peasant’s daughter, dares
sometimes, proud maiden, that she grips at

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:36.750
me, attacks me in my redness, plunders my
head, confines me in a stronghold, feels my

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:39.900
encounter directly, woman with braided hair.

00:04:39.900 --> 00:05:02.840
Wet be 

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:10.560
that eye.

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:29.879
Answer: An Onion
