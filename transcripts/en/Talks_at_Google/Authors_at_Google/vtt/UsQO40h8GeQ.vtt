00:00:01.404 --> 00:00:02.810
MALE SPEAKER: All right.

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:04.169
Good afternoon, everyone.

00:00:04.169 --> 00:00:05.210
Thank you all for coming.

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:09.940
It is my sincere pleasure
to introduce Jason Matthews.

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:13.340
Jason is a retired officer
of the CIA's Operations

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:17.070
Directorate, over a 33
year career in the CIA.

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.400
He's served in multiple
overseas locations

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.630
and engaged in clandestine
collection of national security

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:27.910
intelligence, specializing
in denied-area operations.

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:29.410
Jason has lived
all over the world,

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:31.740
and I'll let him tell you
a little bit about that.

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.810
But he is the best-selling
author of "Red Sparrow"

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:37.060
and he has just come
out with a sequel

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:39.700
to his book called,
"Palace of of Treason".

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:43.189
So if you could all please
help me welcome Jason Matthews.

00:00:43.189 --> 00:00:44.187
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:44.187 --> 00:00:45.270
JASON MATTHEWS: Thank you.

00:00:47.651 --> 00:00:49.900
MALE SPEAKER: And I'll start
off today just asking him

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:52.140
a few questions about
his career in the CIA,

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.970
asking him about his
transition into being

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:56.200
an author, and so on.

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.220
And then we'll open
it up to all of you

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:00.340
for you to ask him
anything you'd like.

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:02.800
I will ask, the
book is fairly new,

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.501
if you could please
avoid spoilers

00:01:04.501 --> 00:01:05.459
on "Palace of Treason".

00:01:05.459 --> 00:01:08.042
I think people watching this on
the live stream and on YouTube

00:01:08.042 --> 00:01:10.600
would really appreciate it.

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.490
Now I didn't include this
in the intro but I did just

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.410
find out that
"Palace of Treason"

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:18.340
is now also in "New
York Times" best seller.

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:19.105
Isn't that right?

00:01:19.105 --> 00:01:19.980
JASON MATTHEWS: Yeah.

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:23.860
The list came out
yesterday and I

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:25.840
got a couple of
congratulatory calls

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.780
from the editor and my
agent, who's always thinking

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:30.370
in terms of 20% to him.

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:31.850
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:33.350
MALE SPEAKER: Well,
congratulations.

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:35.610
That is great news.

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.450
And I think I'm going
to start off just

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.490
by talking about--
if you will-- your,

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:42.780
I'll call it an
explosion onto the scene.

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:43.280
Right?

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.070
You came out with
your debut novel,

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:47.074
it was a tremendous success.

00:01:47.074 --> 00:01:48.740
All the reviews in
the "New York Times",

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:51.860
"Washington Post"
were quite stellar.

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:54.700
And how did that
come across to you?

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:55.930
I mean, was it a surprise?

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:58.760
Was it like a, of course,
I knew this all along.

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:00.600
How did you receive that?

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.690
JASON MATTHEWS: No, what
amounts to a second career

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:07.130
has come as a great surprise
and a pleasant surprise.

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:11.310
I was immensely lucky to find
a great literary agent in New

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.780
York City, immensely
lucky to have

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:17.640
had Scribner, the publisher,
accept the manuscripts,

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.090
both of them.

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:21.220
Incredibly lucky to
have been assigned

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:25.530
a great editor who is himself
a novelist, steel-trap mind

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.320
and a great guy.

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:32.320
And also lucky to
have had the books

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:35.560
critically accepted pretty well.

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.530
It's a very hard industry
to break into it.

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:41.120
And if your book
comes out anywhere

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.350
near the time the last
Stephen King novel comes out,

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:47.386
he sucks all the
air out of the room.

00:02:47.386 --> 00:02:48.632
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:48.632 --> 00:02:51.215
MALE SPEAKER: So there's like,
maybe two weeks out of the year

00:02:51.215 --> 00:02:52.130
where you can publish a book?

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.640
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:53.640
JASON MATTHEWS: Exactly.

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:54.460
He's prolific.

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:57.554
He's great, but he
keeps pumping them out.

00:02:57.554 --> 00:02:59.470
MALE SPEAKER: And as I
mentioned in the intro,

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:01.570
you were in the
CIA for 33 years.

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:04.910
And "Red Sparrow",
"Palace of Treason",

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:09.040
they are spy thrillers, correct?

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.270
And can you talk a
little bit about how

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:16.350
you were able to bring your
long tenured career in the CIA

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:20.660
into your new
adventure as an author?

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:22.180
JASON MATTHEWS: Certainly.

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:25.139
The career, and
parenthetically, my wife Suzanne

00:03:25.139 --> 00:03:25.930
is in the audience.

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:29.090
She's also a 33-year
veteran of the agency.

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:31.850
We met on the job
and we were what

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:34.560
they called a tandem couple.

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.940
But the career is
very experiential,

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:39.505
it's very intense.

00:03:39.505 --> 00:03:44.610
It's 24/7, like a firefighter,
or a policeman, or a jet pilot.

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:49.064
And after 33 years, especially
traveling overseas and doing

00:03:49.064 --> 00:03:51.230
what we do-- and we can
talk about that a little bit

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:55.130
too-- when it comes to a
stop, it's a full stop,

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:59.720
and it's a pretty
tectonic change of life.

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:05.750
So for me, I started
writing almost for therapy,

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:08.680
thinking of war stories
and putting them down.

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:13.090
And in the final analysis, it
was either write, go fishing,

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:17.250
or learn jazz-hands
dancing, and I don't fish.

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:21.720
So I started writing.

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:25.610
MALE SPEAKER: And
both books focus

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:31.520
on a pair of agents, one
American and one Russian,

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:34.050
Dominika.

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:38.930
How much of yourself did you
put into your main characters?

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:40.450
JASON MATTHEWS: The
main characters,

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:43.000
in fact, all the characters
in the plot itself,

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:48.090
is basically a fictitious
mosaic of people I've known,

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:50.260
places we've lived
in, things we've

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:54.310
done, because we had
to get both manuscript

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:57.560
totally reviewed
and approved by CIA.

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:01.440
They have an office called
the Publication Review Board

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:04.840
and they were very careful
and we worked very closely so

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:07.630
that there's no inadvertent
airing of classified

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:09.860
information.

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:11.730
There's nothing
classified in the book,

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:14.440
but the trade
craft is real life,

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:18.720
the vocabulary is insider,
and a lot of the people,

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:20.470
and the places,
and the activities

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:24.530
are based on my career.

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:27.160
MALE SPEAKER: How have your
friends, and colleagues,

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:30.550
and current and
past coworkers, what

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:32.730
have been their
thoughts on the book?

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:35.690
People who are in the CIA?

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:39.480
JASON MATTHEWS: Most of
them have enjoyed the books.

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:43.100
I get the inevitable
telephone call or emails,

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:46.050
next time, man, you have
to put this in, or put me

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:47.161
in the next book.

00:05:47.161 --> 00:05:47.660
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:50.880
JASON MATTHEWS: For the most
part the idea of the reaction

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:51.960
is positive.

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:55.700
There are a few purists who
say, you know, when you retire,

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:57.680
you should really
just retire and not

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:00.560
write about the life and things.

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:05.540
But in reality, these two books
are my love letters to CIA.

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:10.960
I'm celebrating a career,
worked in an elite organization,

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:13.530
did arcane work and
served my country.

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:16.430
So that's what these
books are about.

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:19.179
And celebrating
the New Cold War.

00:06:19.179 --> 00:06:20.470
MALE SPEAKER: I'll get to that.

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:23.150
I'm sure lots of us have
plenty of questions about that.

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:25.489
But you did touch on
the CIA Review Board.

00:06:25.489 --> 00:06:27.780
And I think we would all love
to hear a little bit more

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:28.300
about that.

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:30.510
What is the review process like?

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:33.650
What are their main
concerns and main objectives

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:35.300
when they're
reviewing your book?

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:39.440
And were you able to
proactively prevent them

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:41.114
from redacting anything?

00:06:41.114 --> 00:06:42.780
JASON MATTHEWS: Yeah,
it's less a matter

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:45.180
of preventing them
from redaction

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:48.920
or them taking too heavy a hand.

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:52.350
But we worked very
closely together.

00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:57.280
But as an example, the
CIA training facility

00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:58.120
is called the Farm.

00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:00.350
It's down in
Tidewater, Virginia.

00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:03.780
I can, in a fictional novel,
I can describe the Farm,

00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:06.110
put the characters in the
Farm, go through training

00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:07.380
at the Farm.

00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:11.180
But I'm not allowed to name
the river on whose banks

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:12.900
the Farm is located.

00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:15.580
And why, I asked the PRB.

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:18.400
They said, well, it would
confirm the location.

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:21.730
I said, but look in Wikipedia.

00:07:21.730 --> 00:07:23.460
Google the damn place.

00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:26.160
It's all over,
including that river.

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:26.840
No, no, no.

00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:27.950
It would confirm it.

00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:28.760
It's classified.

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:31.990
You may not add it to your book.

00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:33.630
So I had images
of Vladimir Putin

00:07:33.630 --> 00:07:36.440
in the basement of the
Kremlin, slapping his forehead,

00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:37.970
reading "Palace of
Treason" saying,

00:07:37.970 --> 00:07:39.912
so that's where the Farm is.

00:07:39.912 --> 00:07:41.328
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:43.882 --> 00:07:45.840
MALE SPEAKER: I think
that's a great transition

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:48.850
point to talking a little bit
more about the New Cold War.

00:07:48.850 --> 00:07:53.900
And Vladimir Putin is a
very polarizing figure.

00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:57.780
He gets constantly
lampooned on TV.

00:07:57.780 --> 00:07:59.770
He has done everything
under the sun,

00:07:59.770 --> 00:08:05.760
and now he is a character
and your novels, right?

00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:08.499
As much as people like to joke
about him, at the same time

00:08:08.499 --> 00:08:10.040
he is a world leader
and he does have

00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:12.900
a tremendous impact on the
lives of millions of people.

00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:15.679
How is the time
that we're living

00:08:15.679 --> 00:08:17.470
in now and the current
political landscape,

00:08:17.470 --> 00:08:19.940
how does it compare to
the political landscape

00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:21.710
when you were an
operative, and when

00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:23.950
you were involved with the CIA?

00:08:23.950 --> 00:08:26.160
JASON MATTHEWS: That's
a good question.

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:28.360
I maintain that there's
a new Cold War going on.

00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:30.990
A Cold War is
basically, it describes

00:08:30.990 --> 00:08:34.309
the bilateral relationship
between two states.

00:08:34.309 --> 00:08:39.280
And I believe that the level of
espionage between two countries

00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:43.030
is a good barometer of
how the Cold War is going.

00:08:43.030 --> 00:08:47.980
And the Russians are
spying their heads off.

00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:51.650
In the summer of
2010, you remember

00:08:51.650 --> 00:08:55.580
the FBI in New York arrested
11 Russian illegals.

00:08:55.580 --> 00:09:00.080
These are deep cover
sleeper assets.

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:03.110
They had lived in the
United States as Americans,

00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:06.680
as our neighbors,
for a decade trying

00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:09.700
to develop access to secrets.

00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:13.020
Last January the FBI,
also in New York,

00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:17.740
popped a Russian-- by
popped, I mean arrested--

00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:22.290
a Russian banker who was
an intelligence officer

00:09:22.290 --> 00:09:25.690
and he was nosing around the
New York Stock Exchange trying

00:09:25.690 --> 00:09:28.770
to get a handle
on the high volume

00:09:28.770 --> 00:09:32.110
electronic network
system, exchange system,

00:09:32.110 --> 00:09:33.110
in Wall Street.

00:09:33.110 --> 00:09:38.000
He was also looking
into how the Russian

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:43.030
oligarch's-- Putin's buddies--
funds had been frozen

00:09:43.030 --> 00:09:45.180
for sanctions in
the United States.

00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:47.940
I think they were
contingency casing

00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:50.300
for maybe some cyber attack.

00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:55.990
So the Cold War is
moving, is still going on.

00:09:55.990 --> 00:09:59.200
Putin famously said, you know,
Russia never lost the Cold War

00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:01.870
because it never ended.

00:10:01.870 --> 00:10:04.530
A lot has been
written about him.

00:10:04.530 --> 00:10:08.170
He's a fantastic character
and I thank him every morning.

00:10:08.170 --> 00:10:10.320
I thank Vlad for being Vlad.

00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:13.970
He's a great
character for a book.

00:10:13.970 --> 00:10:16.110
MALE SPEAKER: Thanks.

00:10:16.110 --> 00:10:17.980
Also, we're at Google, right?

00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:21.350
We all work in technology,
either directly or indirectly.

00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:25.150
And technology has--
every day it's constantly

00:10:25.150 --> 00:10:27.770
changing the game, it's
changing espionage,

00:10:27.770 --> 00:10:30.680
it's changing
intelligence, and so on.

00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:32.980
Could you talk a little
bit more about how

00:10:32.980 --> 00:10:38.840
the CA today, with drones and
collections of information

00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:41.790
and so on, compares to
the CIA of the Cold War

00:10:41.790 --> 00:10:43.440
with more of that
human intelligence

00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:46.170
type of interaction?

00:10:46.170 --> 00:10:49.770
JASON MATTHEWS: Coming from my
generation and from my optic,

00:10:49.770 --> 00:10:52.690
there's no replacement for
human intelligence, what

00:10:52.690 --> 00:10:54.320
they call HUMINT.

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:56.320
That's what we do we.

00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:58.650
We're sort of like
clandestine journalists.

00:10:58.650 --> 00:11:02.740
We look for a story, a
reporter looks for a story.

00:11:02.740 --> 00:11:05.510
We have Intel requirements.

00:11:05.510 --> 00:11:08.450
A reporter will find a
source in the mayor's office

00:11:08.450 --> 00:11:10.280
because there's a
scandal going on.

00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:13.060
We have intelligence
sources and we recruit them.

00:11:13.060 --> 00:11:14.690
A reporter will file a story.

00:11:14.690 --> 00:11:16.900
We file Intel reports.

00:11:16.900 --> 00:11:20.840
And a reporter will
protect his source,

00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:22.640
to the extent that
maybe he or she will

00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:26.480
go to jail before they reveal
the identity of his source.

00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:28.560
We have what they
call tradecraft, which

00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:32.200
is a fancy word for
skulking around,

00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:36.070
to prevent people
from understanding

00:11:36.070 --> 00:11:40.690
contact between an intelligence
officer and a foreign source.

00:11:40.690 --> 00:11:45.120
So clandestine
journalism and HUMINT

00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:47.530
are still sort of
the gold standard.

00:11:47.530 --> 00:11:50.770
Now you have imagery
intelligence, pictures taken

00:11:50.770 --> 00:11:52.040
from satellites called IMINT.

00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:55.620
You've got signals intelligence,
sucking everything out

00:11:55.620 --> 00:12:02.660
of the SIGINT, and
other kinds of INT's.

00:12:02.660 --> 00:12:07.190
But as much as
technology has advanced,

00:12:07.190 --> 00:12:10.230
HUMINT is still
the gold standard.

00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:14.530
It's the only way you can
get into the heads of leaders

00:12:14.530 --> 00:12:16.420
and discover what
we call the plans

00:12:16.420 --> 00:12:18.870
and intentions of a state.

00:12:18.870 --> 00:12:20.810
Very important.

00:12:20.810 --> 00:12:23.370
MALE SPEAKER: That does
make a lot of sense.

00:12:23.370 --> 00:12:25.397
And going back briefly
to something you

00:12:25.397 --> 00:12:26.980
mentioned towards
the beginning, which

00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:30.630
is that these are somewhat
of a love letter to the CIA

00:12:30.630 --> 00:12:33.150
and to your career.

00:12:33.150 --> 00:12:37.310
One of the very few criticisms
I've seen directed at you

00:12:37.310 --> 00:12:39.880
is that maybe your
view of the CIA

00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:42.570
is a little bit too rose-tinted.

00:12:42.570 --> 00:12:46.000
What would be your
response to that idea?

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.770
JASON MATTHEWS: Well, I'm
a former agency officer

00:12:48.770 --> 00:12:52.110
and I'm writing about the
good guys versus the bad guys.

00:12:52.110 --> 00:12:57.070
But even in the book there
are some pretty detestable CIA

00:12:57.070 --> 00:12:59.220
officers, including
one traitor who's

00:12:59.220 --> 00:13:02.820
trying to sell secrets
to the Russians.

00:13:02.820 --> 00:13:07.340
And you know, a book, a
fiction, is something,

00:13:07.340 --> 00:13:10.710
at least in my case, you
start writing Chapter One

00:13:10.710 --> 00:13:13.470
and I have no idea where
the story is going to go.

00:13:13.470 --> 00:13:16.100
I liken it to riding down
whitewater in a bathtub.

00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:19.450
I just hang on and let it go.

00:13:19.450 --> 00:13:25.030
So yeah, criticisms and another
things in various reviews,

00:13:25.030 --> 00:13:28.702
I take to heart, but I don't
dwell on them too too much.

00:13:28.702 --> 00:13:30.410
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah,
that's probably best.

00:13:30.410 --> 00:13:35.650
And I do think one of the
biggest praise that was leveled

00:13:35.650 --> 00:13:38.770
at the book is
that roller coaster

00:13:38.770 --> 00:13:41.180
ride, emotional
thriller, very exciting.

00:13:41.180 --> 00:13:43.140
And it seems like you
had the same process

00:13:43.140 --> 00:13:43.840
as you were writing it.

00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:44.964
JASON MATTHEWS: Absolutely.

00:13:44.964 --> 00:13:46.280
MALE SPEAKER: Which is great.

00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:49.290
And just to wrap up before
we open up to the audience,

00:13:49.290 --> 00:13:52.490
just looking towards the
future, this is a second book.

00:13:52.490 --> 00:13:55.064
The first book has been
picked up for a movie,

00:13:55.064 --> 00:13:55.730
is that correct?

00:13:55.730 --> 00:13:56.150
JASON MATTHEWS: That's right.

00:13:56.150 --> 00:13:58.460
MALE SPEAKER: Where do
you see the books going,

00:13:58.460 --> 00:13:59.864
the characters going forward?

00:13:59.864 --> 00:14:01.780
JASON MATTHEWS: Well,
my editor and the agents

00:14:01.780 --> 00:14:04.154
say that there's probably
enough gas in the tank to write

00:14:04.154 --> 00:14:07.020
one more book in a trilogy.

00:14:07.020 --> 00:14:09.030
But each book has its
particular challenge.

00:14:09.030 --> 00:14:11.530
The first book, obviously, I
was learning as I was going on.

00:14:11.530 --> 00:14:12.720
I'm still learning.

00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:15.000
Second book,
different challenges.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:16.680
One has to tell the back story.

00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:18.880
In other words, if you
pick up book number two

00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:20.800
and have not read
book number one,

00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:24.034
you've got to understand a
little bit about what went on.

00:14:24.034 --> 00:14:26.200
And it's very difficult to
write a back story that's

00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:31.220
not ponderous, and
boring, and sludgy.

00:14:31.220 --> 00:14:36.310
So book three, the end of a
trilogy, further challenges.

00:14:36.310 --> 00:14:38.610
How are you going to
close the episode off?

00:14:38.610 --> 00:14:43.124
What's going to happen
to the characters?

00:14:43.124 --> 00:14:46.680
And I know when we sold the
movie rights to the first book

00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:49.940
to Hollywood, they
kept telling me

00:14:49.940 --> 00:14:52.090
the F word, which is franchise.

00:14:52.090 --> 00:14:53.515
They love a franchise.

00:14:53.515 --> 00:14:56.400
They love "The Bourne
Identity" movies.

00:14:56.400 --> 00:15:00.140
And if I write two, or
three, or four books,

00:15:00.140 --> 00:15:04.550
they'll keep writing scripts
way beyond my ability to keep up

00:15:04.550 --> 00:15:07.210
with them writing novels.

00:15:07.210 --> 00:15:11.710
And the end of
writing of a script

00:15:11.710 --> 00:15:15.510
is another interesting
aspect of my second career

00:15:15.510 --> 00:15:19.190
as a fledgling novelist.

00:15:19.190 --> 00:15:22.080
The challenge is
some screenwriter

00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:28.680
has to condense a 400-page novel
into a 150-page script, which

00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:31.710
is mostly dialogue and
a lot of white space.

00:15:31.710 --> 00:15:36.440
John le Carre once famously
said, "If a book is a cow,

00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:38.775
a movie script is
a bouillon cube."

00:15:38.775 --> 00:15:40.110
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:40.110 --> 00:15:43.600
JASON MATTHEWS: Squeezed
down and very intense.

00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:46.540
So we're going
through that process

00:15:46.540 --> 00:15:50.780
too, figuring out the movie,
a scriptwriter's doing it

00:15:50.780 --> 00:15:52.930
and 20th Century Fox
bought the rights.

00:15:52.930 --> 00:15:56.216
So it's another
exciting chapter.

00:15:56.216 --> 00:15:57.090
MALE SPEAKER: Thanks.

00:15:57.090 --> 00:16:00.200
And I have to say,
just as we close,

00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:01.445
I loved reading the book.

00:16:01.445 --> 00:16:04.531
It was so wonderful, and
I'm really looking forward

00:16:04.531 --> 00:16:06.030
to everybody having
a chance to read

00:16:06.030 --> 00:16:07.484
the continuation in the series.

00:16:07.484 --> 00:16:09.400
And I'm looking forward
to what's coming next.

00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:10.483
JASON MATTHEWS: Thank you.

00:16:10.483 --> 00:16:11.690
I hope everybody enjoys it.

00:16:11.690 --> 00:16:12.689
MALE SPEAKER: Thank you.

00:16:12.689 --> 00:16:14.559
So we do have a
microphone here for you.

00:16:14.559 --> 00:16:16.350
If you have a question,
if you could please

00:16:16.350 --> 00:16:17.433
speak into the microphone.

00:16:22.010 --> 00:16:24.290
And I'll turn it
over to all of you.

00:16:24.290 --> 00:16:27.400
JASON MATTHEWS: A lot of people
say, oh, here comes the Q&amp;A.

00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:29.380
He's not going to
answer anything.

00:16:29.380 --> 00:16:32.220
I'll answer any
questions that you ask.

00:16:32.220 --> 00:16:33.720
AUDIENCE: So what
kind of experience

00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:36.780
did you have as a
writer when you retired?

00:16:36.780 --> 00:16:42.850
And how much of what's in the
book is really your writing,

00:16:42.850 --> 00:16:49.030
and how much did the editor help
you really put it into a novel,

00:16:49.030 --> 00:16:51.990
with the flow and all
that kind of thing.

00:16:51.990 --> 00:16:55.280
JASON MATTHEWS: Good question,
and I get that question

00:16:55.280 --> 00:16:56.380
occasionally.

00:16:56.380 --> 00:16:58.270
And it occurred to
me after hearing

00:16:58.270 --> 00:17:01.910
the question for some time
that CIA officers do nothing

00:17:01.910 --> 00:17:04.540
in their career but write.

00:17:04.540 --> 00:17:08.680
We skulk around at midnight
and get Intel from sources.

00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:12.010
Then in the day, we write
intelligence reports.

00:17:12.010 --> 00:17:13.160
We have to write estimates.

00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:17.020
We have to write predictions.

00:17:17.020 --> 00:17:18.630
After each meeting,
we have to write

00:17:18.630 --> 00:17:21.910
what they call a Contact Report,
which is who, what, when, why,

00:17:21.910 --> 00:17:24.359
where, atmospherics.

00:17:24.359 --> 00:17:26.890
What's the source doing,
what's the source saying?

00:17:26.890 --> 00:17:29.110
Sort of a mini novella, almost.

00:17:29.110 --> 00:17:31.760
And in some cases, there's
a lot of fiction going on

00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:33.070
in there too.

00:17:33.070 --> 00:17:36.440
But so we have-- and
we don't realise it--

00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:39.100
we have a lot of
experience writing.

00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:44.420
Making the transition then to a
commercially-viable manuscript

00:17:44.420 --> 00:17:47.130
is all about the editor.

00:17:47.130 --> 00:17:50.840
If I build the house-- the
whole manuscript is 100% mine,

00:17:50.840 --> 00:17:55.525
but I build the house and
he decorates the inside.

00:17:55.525 --> 00:17:57.660
He does the interior decorating.

00:17:57.660 --> 00:17:59.800
Very, very important.

00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:01.760
And sometimes he has
the unmitigated gall

00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:04.460
to tell me Chapters One
through Five are horrible,

00:18:04.460 --> 00:18:06.256
cut them out.

00:18:06.256 --> 00:18:06.755
Dang.

00:18:13.480 --> 00:18:16.070
AUDIENCE: So a lot
of what most of us

00:18:16.070 --> 00:18:21.030
know about the CIA comes from
novels like this and Hollywood.

00:18:21.030 --> 00:18:24.160
And as someone who's
participated in both, or maybe

00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:33.040
in all three soon to be,
how much of the real life

00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:36.500
does Hollywood and these
types of novels represent?

00:18:36.500 --> 00:18:41.090
One could imagine that your
average meeting with a source

00:18:41.090 --> 00:18:45.550
is nothing but mundane,
and Hollywood and novels

00:18:45.550 --> 00:18:47.900
tend to pull out the
ones that are pretty

00:18:47.900 --> 00:18:49.810
exciting for obvious reasons.

00:18:49.810 --> 00:18:57.880
But I'm curious when you were
interacting with your sources

00:18:57.880 --> 00:19:01.400
back in your previous career,
was every one exciting?

00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:02.600
Were half of them exciting?

00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:04.970
Or are we talking about
the 10% of the time

00:19:04.970 --> 00:19:08.580
where things went the wrong way?

00:19:08.580 --> 00:19:10.240
JASON MATTHEWS:
It's closer to 10%.

00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:13.580
Like a journalist or
reporter will be doing story,

00:19:13.580 --> 00:19:14.950
after story, after story.

00:19:14.950 --> 00:19:17.220
And maybe once, twice,
three times in a career,

00:19:17.220 --> 00:19:22.700
it gets the big Pulitzer
Prize kind of reportage.

00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:28.000
And yeah, most sources, who we
call agents, a lot of people

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:29.800
call CIA officers agents.

00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:32.550
Were actually case
officers or officers.

00:19:32.550 --> 00:19:35.470
Agents in our lexicon
refers to the foreigners

00:19:35.470 --> 00:19:38.680
that we recruit who have
access to secrets, mostly

00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:41.140
governmental types.

00:19:41.140 --> 00:19:44.500
And we do we do a
lot of work on trying

00:19:44.500 --> 00:19:48.820
to quantify their motivations
and their vulnerabilities.

00:19:48.820 --> 00:19:55.590
In fact, we have an
acronym, M I C E, MICE,

00:19:55.590 --> 00:19:58.000
which stands for the four
basic human motivators.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:00.350
We all have them in some
degree or the other.

00:20:00.350 --> 00:20:05.130
And it stands for money,
ideology, conscience, and ego.

00:20:05.130 --> 00:20:09.310
And each agent, each
source, is different,

00:20:09.310 --> 00:20:12.177
just like people,
different motivations,

00:20:12.177 --> 00:20:13.010
different behaviors.

00:20:16.130 --> 00:20:18.510
We had a little venal
source at one point

00:20:18.510 --> 00:20:23.450
who said he could take a
picture of the new MiG-23.

00:20:23.450 --> 00:20:26.260
And so he crawled
all over the plane

00:20:26.260 --> 00:20:28.160
and was taking pictures,
and taking pictures,

00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:29.160
and taking pictures.

00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:31.540
The MiG-23 is one those
swept-wing fighters,

00:20:31.540 --> 00:20:35.300
big sharp nose, and a nose
needle called a pitot tube

00:20:35.300 --> 00:20:37.410
which measures air speed.

00:20:37.410 --> 00:20:40.150
So this guy was crawling
around and taking pictures.

00:20:40.150 --> 00:20:41.690
And he was calculating
in his mind

00:20:41.690 --> 00:20:43.480
every frame was
X-number of dollars,

00:20:43.480 --> 00:20:44.980
he was clicking,
clicking, clicking.

00:20:44.980 --> 00:20:48.094
But being a little guy, he
started sliding off-- this

00:20:48.094 --> 00:20:49.760
was at midnight-- he
started sliding off

00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:51.275
the edge of the nose.

00:20:51.275 --> 00:20:54.740
He bounced off the nose
needle, the pitot tube,

00:20:54.740 --> 00:21:00.260
and fell on to the tarmac, and
he bent it 20 degrees downward.

00:21:00.260 --> 00:21:03.015
He tried pushing it up,
pushing it up, pushing it up.

00:21:03.015 --> 00:21:04.345
It wouldn't budge.

00:21:04.345 --> 00:21:07.220
So coming back later
he told us about it.

00:21:07.220 --> 00:21:10.030
I said, you know, you
have to steal secrets,

00:21:10.030 --> 00:21:13.160
but the theft of the secret
has to be undetectable.

00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:13.662
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:13.662 --> 00:21:15.120
JASON MATTHEWS: So
what did you do?

00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:15.970
What did you do?

00:21:15.970 --> 00:21:16.970
What did you do?

00:21:16.970 --> 00:21:18.030
I don't know.

00:21:18.030 --> 00:21:21.490
The last picture in the roll,
he had gone down the flight line

00:21:21.490 --> 00:21:26.680
and pulled down all the pitot
tubes to match the first one.

00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:28.360
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:36.270
JASON MATTHEWS: M
I C E. War stories.

00:21:36.270 --> 00:21:39.620
So to answer your question,
there are gold plated ones

00:21:39.620 --> 00:21:42.460
and there are real
clunkers, but we

00:21:42.460 --> 00:21:46.050
have to protect each
one of them equally.

00:21:46.050 --> 00:21:49.770
That's an ethos
of our profession.

00:21:49.770 --> 00:21:52.530
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

00:21:52.530 --> 00:21:55.056
Which books are
your favorite books?

00:21:55.056 --> 00:21:56.430
As you were writing,
I'm sure you

00:21:56.430 --> 00:21:59.100
had an idea in your mind
of what makes a good book.

00:21:59.100 --> 00:22:02.700
I'm sure you tried to
make your book match that.

00:22:02.700 --> 00:22:04.709
Which other books or
which other authors

00:22:04.709 --> 00:22:07.080
match that best,
in your opinion?

00:22:07.080 --> 00:22:08.610
JASON MATTHEWS:
Excellent question.

00:22:08.610 --> 00:22:11.070
I read voraciously, and
not just spy thrillers,

00:22:11.070 --> 00:22:13.650
and not just commercial
spy thrillers.

00:22:13.650 --> 00:22:17.190
I like sort of literary
fiction, and I dabble

00:22:17.190 --> 00:22:19.010
in absolutely everything.

00:22:19.010 --> 00:22:24.710
And as a rough yardstick--
and we've all opened a book

00:22:24.710 --> 00:22:27.230
and after the first two
or three pages, we say,

00:22:27.230 --> 00:22:28.780
oh, this is going to be tough.

00:22:28.780 --> 00:22:32.560
You almost have to push through
a barrier to get going with it.

00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:39.270
So my editor also taught me
fast start, keep it going,

00:22:39.270 --> 00:22:43.986
each chapter should end with
sort of grace note, duh, duh,

00:22:43.986 --> 00:22:44.680
duh, duh.

00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:47.880
And then that makes people
turn to the next chapter.

00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:52.440
I mean, this is what I
have, over the years,

00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:54.010
appreciated in good literature.

00:22:54.010 --> 00:23:00.450
The classics, Graham Greene,
John le Carre, in the genre.

00:23:00.450 --> 00:23:03.320
Charles McCarry is fantastic,
an American writer.

00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:05.620
Lot of thriller authors.

00:23:05.620 --> 00:23:07.390
there are a lot of
good ones out there.

00:23:07.390 --> 00:23:09.980
Very few of them have
actually lived the life.

00:23:09.980 --> 00:23:11.480
And it's just like,
you want to read

00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:14.480
a novel about
inside baseball, I'd

00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:17.610
like to read one written
by a baseball player.

00:23:17.610 --> 00:23:20.480
MALE SPEAKER: Do you just cringe
when you watch "James Bond"

00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:21.730
or you read "James Bond"?

00:23:21.730 --> 00:23:22.590
Ian Fleming.

00:23:22.590 --> 00:23:25.110
JASON MATTHEWS: No,
it's all good fun.

00:23:25.110 --> 00:23:27.120
It's fine.

00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:32.290
Some US TV shows we do a lot
of cringing when we watch,

00:23:32.290 --> 00:23:34.480
but it's all for entertainment.

00:23:49.419 --> 00:23:49.960
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:23:49.960 --> 00:23:56.360
I was wondering if you could
share back in the mid-70's,

00:23:56.360 --> 00:23:59.640
how you got into the CIA?

00:23:59.640 --> 00:24:01.630
And if that had always
been a dream of yours

00:24:01.630 --> 00:24:04.280
as a child or whatnot.

00:24:04.280 --> 00:24:06.600
JASON MATTHEWS: Thank you.

00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:09.720
I wasn't particularly,
from kindergarten,

00:24:09.720 --> 00:24:13.800
dreaming of being a spy or
intelligence officer at all.

00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:17.610
I went through school, I majored
in languages and English.

00:24:17.610 --> 00:24:20.110
I got a Master's Degree from
the University of Missouri

00:24:20.110 --> 00:24:21.540
in Journalism.

00:24:21.540 --> 00:24:23.760
And then after that,
I went to Washington

00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:26.017
to start interviewing for jobs.

00:24:26.017 --> 00:24:28.100
And I interviewed with the
Department of Interior,

00:24:28.100 --> 00:24:31.090
of State, you name it.

00:24:31.090 --> 00:24:32.250
Right time, right place.

00:24:32.250 --> 00:24:35.390
I could have been writhing
ad copy for the National Park

00:24:35.390 --> 00:24:35.930
Service.

00:24:35.930 --> 00:24:37.450
Who knew.

00:24:37.450 --> 00:24:40.260
One dark and stormy
afternoon, the interview

00:24:40.260 --> 00:24:43.880
was with the agency
and I spoke a language

00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:45.810
they needed at the time.

00:24:45.810 --> 00:24:49.200
And you blink your eyes,
and 33 years later,

00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:51.030
you have a career
under your belt.

00:24:51.030 --> 00:24:55.920
So I never really set to join.

00:24:55.920 --> 00:24:59.980
I met my wife during my first
tour and we got married.

00:24:59.980 --> 00:25:03.290
And we're called, as I
mentioned, a tandem couple.

00:25:03.290 --> 00:25:05.670
During the old days
of the Cold War,

00:25:05.670 --> 00:25:09.420
the Soviets, and East
Bloc guys, and the Cubans,

00:25:09.420 --> 00:25:12.850
in their chauvinism never
assumed that a spouse

00:25:12.850 --> 00:25:15.040
would do anything operational.

00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:17.600
All women did was go
to the grocery store

00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:19.630
and push the baby in carriage.

00:25:19.630 --> 00:25:22.300
So on any given dark
and stormy night--

00:25:22.300 --> 00:25:27.310
I keep using that-- I'd
lead 15 surveillance

00:25:27.310 --> 00:25:30.220
members across the
city park and Suzanne

00:25:30.220 --> 00:25:33.720
would be coming back from
Ladies Book Club at the Canadian

00:25:33.720 --> 00:25:34.720
Embassy.

00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:38.750
She'd check her status, she
was black, surveillance free,

00:25:38.750 --> 00:25:40.865
and she'd go and do
the operational act,

00:25:40.865 --> 00:25:43.960
mark the signal, put down
a package, meet a person.

00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:46.920
They never knew what hit them.

00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:48.697
And it was a lot
safer for me too.

00:25:48.697 --> 00:25:50.685
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:57.660 --> 00:26:01.560
AUDIENCE: So the CIA, along
with certain other intelligence

00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:04.400
agencies, I think
have always had

00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:07.570
a little bit of a PR problem.

00:26:07.570 --> 00:26:10.565
I mean, the public sort of
hears about the bad things,

00:26:10.565 --> 00:26:12.440
the things that go wrong,
and of course, they

00:26:12.440 --> 00:26:15.024
don't hear about the good things
because you can't tell people

00:26:15.024 --> 00:26:15.940
about the good things.

00:26:15.940 --> 00:26:17.790
All the great successes
you can't share.

00:26:17.790 --> 00:26:20.110
So do you feel that part
of the goal of your books

00:26:20.110 --> 00:26:24.330
is to kind of help the
public perception of the CIA

00:26:24.330 --> 00:26:28.080
and give them, if not sort
of real successes, at least

00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:29.880
give them the flavor
of the kinds of things

00:26:29.880 --> 00:26:32.320
that the agency does?

00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:34.030
JASON MATTHEWS: Partly so.

00:26:34.030 --> 00:26:37.590
I don't have such lofty
goals for my book,

00:26:37.590 --> 00:26:41.370
but what I do tell
a lot of people

00:26:41.370 --> 00:26:47.260
is that I try to put
the real juice in there

00:26:47.260 --> 00:26:51.890
to give people a sense of a
secret life and a secret world

00:26:51.890 --> 00:26:54.990
that many people don't exist.

00:26:54.990 --> 00:27:00.510
So it's the career through my
eyes, but it's fictionalized.

00:27:00.510 --> 00:27:02.980
A couple of months
ago my publisher

00:27:02.980 --> 00:27:06.050
arranged for me to walk around
Manhattan with a "New York

00:27:06.050 --> 00:27:07.670
Times" reporter.

00:27:07.670 --> 00:27:11.140
And the title of the
morning was going

00:27:11.140 --> 00:27:12.960
to be, "To See the
Streets of New York

00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:15.669
through the Eyes of a Spy".

00:27:15.669 --> 00:27:17.960
And the "New York Times" guy
was a little bit skeptical

00:27:17.960 --> 00:27:21.230
and he had his notebook
out and we started walking.

00:27:21.230 --> 00:27:24.800
And I started pointing out all
the security cameras, hundreds

00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:26.790
of them on Sixth Avenue.

00:27:26.790 --> 00:27:29.950
An average New Yorker walks
under these a hundred times

00:27:29.950 --> 00:27:32.350
a day and doesn't see them.

00:27:32.350 --> 00:27:33.950
I described how a
surveillance team

00:27:33.950 --> 00:27:35.445
would cover us on Sixth Avenue.

00:27:35.445 --> 00:27:40.080
We went up to Bryant Park and I
described how we look at people

00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:43.070
and how different
demeanor happens.

00:27:43.070 --> 00:27:45.420
And at the end of
the walk, he said

00:27:45.420 --> 00:27:47.740
that he would never look
at New York City streets

00:27:47.740 --> 00:27:48.960
the same again.

00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:52.300
And he wrote a little
article in the Arts section

00:27:52.300 --> 00:27:54.570
of the "Times".

00:27:54.570 --> 00:27:58.640
So through my eyes,
an arcane and sort

00:27:58.640 --> 00:28:04.030
of weird career, and hopefully
entertaining and a good yarn.

00:28:04.030 --> 00:28:08.922
But the CIA can tend
to its own reputation.

00:28:08.922 --> 00:28:09.422
Yeah.

00:28:15.594 --> 00:28:16.135
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:28:16.135 --> 00:28:17.560
Two part question.

00:28:17.560 --> 00:28:21.056
Over the 33-year
career, you talked

00:28:21.056 --> 00:28:22.180
about the MICE motivations.

00:28:22.180 --> 00:28:28.610
Have seen any change in the
motivations of your agents

00:28:28.610 --> 00:28:32.100
in that 33-year period,
from an ideology to money,

00:28:32.100 --> 00:28:33.740
or money to ideology.

00:28:33.740 --> 00:28:34.850
That's the first part.

00:28:34.850 --> 00:28:37.150
And the second part
is, what the going rate

00:28:37.150 --> 00:28:41.030
to betray you country, on
the money and the motivation

00:28:41.030 --> 00:28:43.650
side of things?

00:28:43.650 --> 00:28:46.590
JASON MATTHEWS:
In terms of MICE,

00:28:46.590 --> 00:28:50.080
these things are pretty
universal and pretty enduring.

00:28:50.080 --> 00:28:53.720
You know, I sometimes say that
espionage is the second oldest

00:28:53.720 --> 00:28:54.832
profession.

00:28:54.832 --> 00:28:57.040
And what it has in common
with the oldest professions

00:28:57.040 --> 00:28:59.200
is that eventually someone's
going to get screwed.

00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:00.490
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:00.490 --> 00:29:04.904
JASON MATTHEWS: But money,
ideology, lack of ideology.

00:29:04.904 --> 00:29:06.320
For instance,
during the Cold War,

00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:10.140
a Soviet would come
up to you and say,

00:29:10.140 --> 00:29:15.070
I realize this is all a lie
and I want to help my country.

00:29:15.070 --> 00:29:19.590
I've lost my idealism,
and sign me up.

00:29:19.590 --> 00:29:20.965
And same thing
with a conscience.

00:29:20.965 --> 00:29:24.830
I've done terrible things and
now I want to atone for them.

00:29:24.830 --> 00:29:27.220
And each agent who was
motivated by different things,

00:29:27.220 --> 00:29:28.640
you have to watch them.

00:29:28.640 --> 00:29:31.590
The person who wants
to atone for past sins

00:29:31.590 --> 00:29:34.070
might be reckless
because he really doesn't

00:29:34.070 --> 00:29:36.850
care how many risks he takes.

00:29:36.850 --> 00:29:39.280
So the short answer
to your question

00:29:39.280 --> 00:29:43.910
is that these things
seem to be universal.

00:29:43.910 --> 00:29:49.210
Now I've never sat across the
table from someone from ISIS

00:29:49.210 --> 00:29:52.980
and try to figure out what
motivates them, for god sake.

00:29:52.980 --> 00:29:57.060
And that's part of the
new challenge of espionage

00:29:57.060 --> 00:29:58.620
and intelligence work.

00:29:58.620 --> 00:30:02.210
We've got non-state actors
and it's very, very hard

00:30:02.210 --> 00:30:04.750
to get a handle on.

00:30:04.750 --> 00:30:08.200
In terms of going rates, it
all depends on the person,

00:30:08.200 --> 00:30:12.930
it depends on their access, it
depends on a number of things.

00:30:12.930 --> 00:30:17.420
During the old Cold War
the actuarial survival rate

00:30:17.420 --> 00:30:21.530
for a Russian who accepted
recruitment outside Russia

00:30:21.530 --> 00:30:24.540
and then went to Moscow
and started spying for us

00:30:24.540 --> 00:30:27.560
was 18 months.

00:30:27.560 --> 00:30:30.920
So they didn't get a chance
to spend the money they made.

00:30:30.920 --> 00:30:33.120
And especially then
every decade when

00:30:33.120 --> 00:30:37.900
you have a Rick Ames or Robert
Hanssen, an American traitor

00:30:37.900 --> 00:30:41.090
who turns over 24
names of assets,

00:30:41.090 --> 00:30:44.330
then everyone goes to jail.

00:30:44.330 --> 00:30:47.150
They had a room in
the Lubyanka Prison,

00:30:47.150 --> 00:30:52.236
one side of which was lined
with massive pine logs.

00:30:52.236 --> 00:30:53.805
That's to prevent the ricochets.

00:30:57.990 --> 00:30:58.970
Serious business.

00:30:58.970 --> 00:30:59.650
Life and death.

00:30:59.650 --> 00:31:05.430
What in the world would make
anyone accept a recruitment

00:31:05.430 --> 00:31:08.210
pitch from a CIA person?

00:31:08.210 --> 00:31:10.830
You're asking people
to commit treason.

00:31:10.830 --> 00:31:13.140
You're asking them to break
the rules of the country

00:31:13.140 --> 00:31:17.880
and depending on the age,
the era and the country.

00:31:17.880 --> 00:31:20.890
It's mortality dangerous.

00:31:20.890 --> 00:31:25.780
There's some very patriotic,
brave people out there

00:31:25.780 --> 00:31:26.470
as we speak.

00:31:33.417 --> 00:31:35.000
AUDIENCE: In the New
World Order where

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:37.590
Asia is emerging pretty
quickly and rapidly

00:31:37.590 --> 00:31:41.510
and China is starting to
dominate the world scene,

00:31:41.510 --> 00:31:45.760
have you seen a change in the
way intelligence gathering

00:31:45.760 --> 00:31:50.230
and the way those governments
and those officers operate?

00:31:50.230 --> 00:31:52.925
Have you see a change in the
general strategy and policy?

00:31:52.925 --> 00:31:54.300
JASON MATTHEWS:
Are you referring

00:31:54.300 --> 00:31:55.840
to the Chinese officers?

00:31:55.840 --> 00:31:56.900
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:31:56.900 --> 00:31:59.630
JASON MATTHEWS: They
have for decades,

00:31:59.630 --> 00:32:02.190
they operate
slightly differently.

00:32:02.190 --> 00:32:06.890
This is my opinion, this
is not an official version.

00:32:06.890 --> 00:32:10.620
They operate very patiently.

00:32:10.620 --> 00:32:13.230
They have, what they
call, a philosophy

00:32:13.230 --> 00:32:16.830
of counting the grains
of sand on a beach.

00:32:16.830 --> 00:32:20.310
Universities all up and down
this west coast of ours,

00:32:20.310 --> 00:32:24.900
Caltech here in San
Francisco, Berkeley,

00:32:24.900 --> 00:32:29.270
filled with Chinese students
who are studying at the PH.D.

00:32:29.270 --> 00:32:33.410
level, studying nuclear physics,
studying weapons design.

00:32:33.410 --> 00:32:37.000
And they get their degrees and
go back to institute one, two,

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:38.890
three, four, in China.

00:32:38.890 --> 00:32:43.550
So yeah, it's a big issue.

00:32:43.550 --> 00:32:46.630
We haven't even started talking
about the cyber threat which

00:32:46.630 --> 00:32:48.850
is another big thing.

00:32:48.850 --> 00:32:51.100
When people ask me, what
are the national security

00:32:51.100 --> 00:32:53.750
threats United
States has to contend

00:32:53.750 --> 00:32:57.764
with, I say the immediate
short-term threat, number one,

00:32:57.764 --> 00:32:59.680
I would think, is the
Iranian Nuclear Program.

00:32:59.680 --> 00:33:02.140
If they get the bomb,
everything starts

00:33:02.140 --> 00:33:05.250
unraveling, in the region
and internationally.

00:33:05.250 --> 00:33:08.440
Long term, I think
China's designs, hegemony

00:33:08.440 --> 00:33:13.440
in the Pacific, challenging US
military strength, the cyber

00:33:13.440 --> 00:33:14.720
part of it.

00:33:14.720 --> 00:33:16.920
Russia is still there.

00:33:16.920 --> 00:33:20.930
Thank god Putin's still doing--
I can write more novels.

00:33:20.930 --> 00:33:24.160
And then the wild card are
the non-state actors now

00:33:24.160 --> 00:33:27.320
that have proliferated,
the Al-Qaedas, the ISISes,

00:33:27.320 --> 00:33:30.060
and the Boko Harams.

00:33:30.060 --> 00:33:33.750
It's a very complicated world,
a lot more complicated than when

00:33:33.750 --> 00:33:37.074
Suzanne and I started working.

00:33:37.074 --> 00:33:39.740
General answer to your question,
it's a very important question.

00:33:39.740 --> 00:33:40.239
Yeah.

00:33:44.814 --> 00:33:47.230
AUDIENCE: I'd like to ask your
opinion, in popular culture

00:33:47.230 --> 00:33:49.730
sometimes Americans
are portrayed

00:33:49.730 --> 00:33:53.040
as having a lack
of language skills,

00:33:53.040 --> 00:33:55.370
or having a certain
cultural deafness.

00:33:55.370 --> 00:34:00.080
So since you have experience
with other countries, agencies,

00:34:00.080 --> 00:34:01.640
can you confirm
that this is true?

00:34:01.640 --> 00:34:09.010
Or do we have rivals among
other countries in terms

00:34:09.010 --> 00:34:11.889
of needing better skills?

00:34:11.889 --> 00:34:14.800
JASON MATTHEWS: Yeah, that's
a very humorous aspect.

00:34:14.800 --> 00:34:18.639
There's nothing quite like
the American tourist in Paris,

00:34:18.639 --> 00:34:21.409
you know, with their
high-top basketball

00:34:21.409 --> 00:34:24.860
shoes and Brooklyn
Dodgers jerseys, and hats

00:34:24.860 --> 00:34:26.000
worn backwards.

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:28.810
The French, they just cringe.

00:34:28.810 --> 00:34:33.050
But it's interesting to note
that other countries have

00:34:33.050 --> 00:34:35.960
their own sort of least
favorite tourists.

00:34:35.960 --> 00:34:40.350
Spaniards, Italians,
and Greeks really

00:34:40.350 --> 00:34:42.670
don't like it when the
German hoards come down

00:34:42.670 --> 00:34:47.889
from north country and wear
sandals and black socks.

00:34:47.889 --> 00:34:49.760
Sometimes the English
football fans,

00:34:49.760 --> 00:34:53.020
when they descend on
Madrid during big soccer

00:34:53.020 --> 00:34:58.260
match, a football match, are
not ambassadors of goodwill.

00:34:58.260 --> 00:35:02.600
So each country has its
own sort of bete noire,

00:35:02.600 --> 00:35:04.096
as far as tourists.

00:35:04.096 --> 00:35:05.970
But Americans, I think,
are getting much more

00:35:05.970 --> 00:35:07.200
sophisticated.

00:35:07.200 --> 00:35:11.190
And happily, a lot of different
countries, more and more people

00:35:11.190 --> 00:35:13.490
speak English.

00:35:13.490 --> 00:35:18.090
In the '60s in Paris,
not too many Frenchmen

00:35:18.090 --> 00:35:20.310
would admit to speaking English.

00:35:20.310 --> 00:35:21.350
Now, a lot do.

00:35:21.350 --> 00:35:24.030
I mean, it's money, and
economics, and tourism.

00:35:37.400 --> 00:35:38.900
AUDIENCE: How has
the agency changed

00:35:38.900 --> 00:35:42.090
over your three-plus
decades working there?

00:35:42.090 --> 00:35:45.340
And then where do you
think it should go next?

00:35:45.340 --> 00:35:47.980
JASON MATTHEWS: Big question.

00:35:47.980 --> 00:35:51.090
It's changed almost
like any organization

00:35:51.090 --> 00:35:52.110
would tend to change.

00:35:52.110 --> 00:35:56.450
The agency came up through
the bones of the OSS

00:35:56.450 --> 00:35:58.710
during World War II.

00:35:58.710 --> 00:36:04.040
In the '50s and the
'60s, almost uniquely,

00:36:04.040 --> 00:36:06.090
they recruited from
the Ivy League schools.

00:36:06.090 --> 00:36:09.350
In fact, the Russians used
to buy all the yearbooks

00:36:09.350 --> 00:36:13.570
of the Ivy League
universities and cut out

00:36:13.570 --> 00:36:15.660
the pages of the
graduating seniors

00:36:15.660 --> 00:36:21.350
and put them in their mug
books because they were sure

00:36:21.350 --> 00:36:25.500
that at least 50% of them
would end up as CIA officers.

00:36:25.500 --> 00:36:29.370
I mean, you graduated from Yale,
you almost had an invitation

00:36:29.370 --> 00:36:31.760
to come into the agency.

00:36:31.760 --> 00:36:36.510
Now, obviously, we're
much more diverse.

00:36:36.510 --> 00:36:38.625
Recruitment standards
are a lot higher.

00:36:41.630 --> 00:36:48.200
They're looking for 400 people
and 50,000 people apply.

00:36:48.200 --> 00:36:50.870
The language requirements
are a lot different.

00:36:50.870 --> 00:36:52.370
Now they're looking
for what we call

00:36:52.370 --> 00:36:59.450
critical languages, Mandarin,
Farsi, other languages.

00:36:59.450 --> 00:37:02.470
And they seem to be
looking also for people who

00:37:02.470 --> 00:37:04.610
are in their second careers.

00:37:04.610 --> 00:37:09.420
I came in straight out
of school, 23 years old.

00:37:09.420 --> 00:37:12.090
But now they're looking
for between 27 and 35 year

00:37:12.090 --> 00:37:16.820
olds, people with a little
more life experience.

00:37:16.820 --> 00:37:21.527
Good aspects to that, but
also less good aspects.

00:37:21.527 --> 00:37:23.610
MALE SPEAKER: Well Jason,
I just want to thank you

00:37:23.610 --> 00:37:24.570
so much for your time.

00:37:24.570 --> 00:37:26.443
I think we've all
enjoyed talking to you

00:37:26.443 --> 00:37:27.420
and hearing from you.

00:37:27.420 --> 00:37:29.860
It's so great to hear from
your first-hand experience.

00:37:29.860 --> 00:37:31.819
The book certainly
reflects that.

00:37:31.819 --> 00:37:34.360
And I wish you all the best and
thank you so much for coming.

00:37:34.360 --> 00:37:35.860
JASON MATTHEWS:
Thank you very much.

00:37:35.860 --> 00:37:38.570
You know, I want to take one
second to thank all you here

00:37:38.570 --> 00:37:41.510
at Google, because
I use Google Earth

00:37:41.510 --> 00:37:44.370
and I do a lot of my
research, and I couldn't

00:37:44.370 --> 00:37:46.930
have done it without you guys.

00:37:46.930 --> 00:37:50.910
I've never been to Moscow
and I learned a lot

00:37:50.910 --> 00:37:54.860
about the Moscow streets
by walking on your backs.

00:37:54.860 --> 00:37:56.340
So thank you very much.

00:37:56.340 --> 00:37:58.820
Keep up the good work.

00:37:58.820 --> 00:38:00.020
MALE SPEAKER: Thank you.

00:38:00.020 --> 00:38:02.470
[APPLAUSE]
