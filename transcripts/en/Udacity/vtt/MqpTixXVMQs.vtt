00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.284
We've solved the equations with integers, now let's try something more

00:00:03.296 --> 00:00:06.771
difficult. Here's an equation with fractions. Let's use our knowledge of

00:00:06.783 --> 00:00:10.589
fractions to help us out. When solving an equation involving fractions it's best

00:00:10.601 --> 00:00:14.152
to clear the denominators first. We can actually undo the division of these

00:00:14.164 --> 00:00:17.996
denominators by multiplying through by the least common denominator. So, here's

00:00:18.008 --> 00:00:21.859
your question, what is the least common denominator for these fractions? As a

00:00:21.871 --> 00:00:27.505
hint, you don't need to worry about the 4, since the 4 is already a factor of 8.
