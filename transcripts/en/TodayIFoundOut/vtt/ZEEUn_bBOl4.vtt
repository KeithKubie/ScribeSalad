00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.389
Hello, I'm Daven Hiskey, you're watching the
TodayIFoundOut YouTube channel.

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:07.189
In the video today, we're looking at if it
is actually possible for a human or small

00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:09.720
group of humans to push a standing cow over.

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:13.660
Let's get started.

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:17.680
For the uninitiated, cow tipping is a prank
where a person sneaks up on a sleeping cow

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:20.390
and pushes the animal over onto its side.

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:23.730
Ask around and you can probably hear about
a friend of a friend who successfully tipped

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.099
a cow while out in the country late one night.

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.810
The story generally recounts participants
having a few alcoholic drinks before driving

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:32.930
to a cow pasture and setting upon a slumbering
bovine.

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:35.090
But is it really possible to tip a cow?

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:39.180
Well, anything is possible and humans are
quite inventive, but in the way that cow tipping

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.200
is generally depicted- no, it is not possible
to tip a sleeping cow.

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.300
The first issue here is that cows don’t
actually sleep while standing up, at least

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.600
not in the way we tend to think of sleep.

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.550
Cows do sometimes enter a sort of restful
state while standing up, but while in this

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:56.580
state they are easily startled and are reasonably
well aware of what’s going on around them.

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:59.830
Their deep sleep state occurs while they are
already lying down (something they do for

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:03.960
about 14 hours per day, with a few hours of
that time in a deep sleep; the rest of the

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.630
time they’re either awake or in their light-resting
state).

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.440
Another issue with the idea of sneaking up
on a cow that is resting while standing is

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:14.870
that at any given time in a herd of cattle,
a number of the cows are wide awake.

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:18.730
Cows may be largely domesticated animals today,
but they still retain their flight instinct

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:22.610
when they suspect a predator is nearby or
observe others in the herd that appear startled

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:23.610
by something.

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.560
One cow will very quickly, via their behavior,
alert the others in the herd if they hear

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:32.160
or see anything suspicious, causing the others
to in turn become on edge and alert.

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:36.220
Given a standing cow that is resting is very
easily startled from its resting state, even

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:39.920
without any other cows around, this makes
the idea of sneaking up on one of these cows

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.740
even more difficult, if not impossible.

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:46.070
But let’s say you and your friends manage
to somehow park your car within walking distance

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:50.640
of a cow without alerting it (harder than
you think on a quiet country night, even parking

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.890
a couple miles away), then you manage to hop
the barbed wire fence and creep up to said

00:01:54.890 --> 00:02:00.240
cow without startling it or any other cows
in the herd via sound, sight, or your scent.

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.850
In that increasingly unlikely scenario, would
you physically have the strength to tip the

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:05.850
cow?

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.630
Dr. Margo Lillie and Tracy Boechler of the
zoology department at the University of British

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:14.400
Columbia conducted a study in 2005 to figure
out the answer to this very question.

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:19.780
Lillie and Boechler determined that it would
take approximately 1,360 to 2,910 Newtons

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.730
of force applied at the optimal angle to tip
an average cow.

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:26.970
(For reference, an average full grown Holstein
dairy cow typically weighs in at around 1,500

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.570
lbs, though this can vary by a few hundred
pounds depending on a variety of factors).

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:35.040
They then estimated that an average adult
human could generate approximately 660 Newtons

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.380
of force at the optimal tipping angle.

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:41.590
So in theory, on the low end with a completely
static cow, approximately two people could

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:44.730
apply enough force to tip said static cow.

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:49.020
The problem is that a cow would most certainly
not stay static in such a scenario.

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:52.840
And heaven help you if you tried to push over
an 1800 to 2000+ pound bull.

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:56.780
(And note, people don’t generally survive
being attacked by such bulls, which is probably

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.209
what would happen if you tried sneaking up
on one and attempted tipping it over.)

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:04.120
So, on the high end, according to Dr. Lillie,
overcoming the non-static cow’s ability

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.450
to brace itself would require in the optimal
scenario around five people.

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:11.870
But even if you did this, there is the fact
that a cow in a state of falling is generally

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:15.160
perfectly agile enough to simply catch itself
and trot away.

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.870
In the end, while it is technically possible
for a group of humans to devise a way to cause

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:23.730
a cow to tip over, it is, in the practical
sense, impossible in the way generally illustrated

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:28.030
when stereotypically inebriated individuals
are described as tipping cows.

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:30.570
So where did the idea of cow tipping come
from?

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:32.640
Unfortunately, the answer is that no one knows
for sure.

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:36.690
It has been theorized that the practice of
attempting cow tipping probably came about

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:41.290
via serving the same function as so called
game of snipe hunting- sending a gullible

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:45.269
individual out to perform some impossible
task for the amusement of those in the know.

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:49.260
(Although it should be noted that this is
a potentially very dangerous snipe hunting

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.920
style game, particularly if there is a bull
around in the herd.)

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:55.480
As for how this particular “game” entered
the mainstream, stories of it began popping

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:59.810
up in the late 20th century and it particularly
gained steam thanks to such movies as the

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:06.170
1989 Heathers and the 1995 Tommy Boy, along
with the 1994 Season 4 episode of Beavis and

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:10.320
Butthead titled “Cow Tipping” where the
duo failed in their attempt at tipping a horse,

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:13.780
then were successful at tipping a cow which
landed on Beavis.

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:19.330
More recently, the 2006 Pixar film Cars depicts
Mater and Lightning tipping cow-like tractors.

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:20.330
Bonus Fact:

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:24.710
An average beef cow contains about 200 kg
of usable meat, which in turn produces enough

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:27.590
meat to make about 4,500 hamburgers at McDonald’s.
