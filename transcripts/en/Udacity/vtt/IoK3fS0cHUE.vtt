00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Now, let's go back to our mass bouncing up and down in the spring.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
You noticed I've changed it from being a horizontally sliding mass to a vertical one.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
The thing I like about this picture is that the mass goes this way

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
counterclockwise though this phase space.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
That's the same direction that we measure angles from,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
so we want to stick with that convention for now.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Other than that, all the physics are the same, so let's say our particle is here, our mass is here--

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
that's almost all the way at x max and it's moving upwards so that it'd be may be somewhere here

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
and going up--this should be negative x max--that's positive.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Okay. So let's say this is an angle π/4 radians or we can draw a right triangle.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
And in this case, since we've flipped the direction--we're not going vertically,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
and now the cosine goes with the velocity component and the sine goes to that position

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
but you could've figured that out from the trigonometry.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Now it's convenient because if we want to calculate let's say the cosine of π/4 radians--

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000
remember when we're using Google before, we were typing something like the cosine of 45°

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
and we're actually had to spell out degrees--yeah, that wasn't very fun.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Now if you type this into Google, it'll just give you your answer--you don't have to specify radians.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:10.000
It assumes radians because radians really are more fundamental than degrees.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:16.000
So if you type this in, you'll find that the velocity at this point is 0.71 Vmax

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
and the position is 0.71&lt;i&gt;Xmax.&lt;/i&gt;

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
I've just plugged in the cosine of π/4 and sine of π/4, and for this angle,

00:01:24.000 --> 99:59:59.000
cosine and sine happen to be completely equal.
