00:00:00.534 --> 00:00:03.773
- The differentiable
functions x and y are related

00:00:03.773 --> 00:00:05.965
by the following equation.

00:00:05.965 --> 00:00:08.715
The sine of x plus cosine of y

00:00:09.578 --> 00:00:12.479
is equal to square root of two.

00:00:12.479 --> 00:00:15.128
They also tell us that the derivative of x

00:00:15.128 --> 00:00:17.897
with respect to t is equal to five.

00:00:17.897 --> 00:00:21.530
They also ask us find the derivative of y

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:25.145
with respect to t when y
is equal to pi over four

00:00:25.145 --> 00:00:29.789
and zero is less than x
is less than pi over two.

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.365
So given that they are
telling us the derivative

00:00:32.365 --> 00:00:34.685
of x with respect to t and we wanna find

00:00:34.685 --> 00:00:37.134
the derivative of y with respect to t,

00:00:37.134 --> 00:00:41.301
it's a safe assumption that
both x and y are functions of t.

00:00:42.403 --> 00:00:45.751
So you could even rewrite
this equation right over here.

00:00:45.751 --> 00:00:48.584
You could rewrite it as sine of x,

00:00:50.683 --> 00:00:53.040
which is a function of t,

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:53.957
plus cosine

00:00:55.815 --> 00:00:58.398
of y, which is a function of t,

00:00:59.499 --> 00:01:02.082
is equal to square root of two.

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:04.542
Now, it might confuse you a little bit,

00:01:04.542 --> 00:01:06.376
you're not used to seeing x as a function

00:01:06.376 --> 00:01:08.524
of a third variable or y as a function

00:01:08.524 --> 00:01:10.068
of something other than x.

00:01:10.068 --> 00:01:11.740
But remember, x and y are just variables.

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:15.419
This could be f of t,
and this could be g of t

00:01:15.419 --> 00:01:17.605
instead of x of t and y of t,

00:01:17.605 --> 00:01:19.503
and that might feel a
little more natural to you.

00:01:19.503 --> 00:01:23.170
But needless to say,
if we wanna find dy dt,

00:01:24.186 --> 00:01:26.264
what we want to do is take the derivative

00:01:26.264 --> 00:01:29.952
with respect to t of both
sides of this equation.

00:01:29.952 --> 00:01:31.357
So let's do that.

00:01:31.357 --> 00:01:33.303
So we're gonna do it
on the left-hand side,

00:01:33.303 --> 00:01:36.541
so it's gonna be we take
that with respect to t,

00:01:36.541 --> 00:01:38.035
derivative of that with respect to t.

00:01:38.035 --> 00:01:41.001
We're gonna take the derivative
of that with respect to t.

00:01:41.001 --> 00:01:42.338
And then we're gonna take the derivative

00:01:42.338 --> 00:01:46.547
of the right-hand side, this
constant with respect to t.

00:01:46.547 --> 00:01:49.764
So let's think about each of these things.

00:01:49.764 --> 00:01:51.444
So what is this.

00:01:51.444 --> 00:01:53.114
Let me do this in a new color.

00:01:53.114 --> 00:01:56.622
The stuff that I'm doing in
this aqua color right over here,

00:01:56.622 --> 00:01:58.245
how could I write that?

00:01:58.245 --> 00:02:00.405
So I'm taking the derivative
with respect to t,

00:02:00.405 --> 00:02:04.918
I have sine of something, which
is itself a function of t.

00:02:04.918 --> 00:02:07.768
So I would just apply the chain rule here.

00:02:07.768 --> 00:02:11.935
I'm first going to take the
derivative with respect to x of

00:02:13.817 --> 00:02:14.650
sine of

00:02:16.508 --> 00:02:18.714
x, I could write sine of x of t,

00:02:18.714 --> 00:02:20.881
but I'll just revert back
to the sine of x here

00:02:20.881 --> 00:02:22.365
for simplicity.

00:02:22.365 --> 00:02:25.244
And then I will then multiply
that times the derivative

00:02:25.244 --> 00:02:28.766
of the inside, you could
say, with respect to t

00:02:28.766 --> 00:02:32.780
times the derivative
of x with respect to t.

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:34.506
This might be a little counterintuitive

00:02:34.506 --> 00:02:36.682
to how you've applied
the chain rule before

00:02:36.682 --> 00:02:38.737
when we only dealt with xs and ys,

00:02:38.737 --> 00:02:41.272
but all that's happening,
I'm taking the derivative

00:02:41.272 --> 00:02:43.565
of the outside of the sine of something

00:02:43.565 --> 00:02:46.547
with respect to the something,
in this case, it is x,

00:02:46.547 --> 00:02:48.503
and then I'm taking the
derivative of the something,

00:02:48.503 --> 00:02:51.415
in this case, x with respect to t.

00:02:51.415 --> 00:02:53.927
Well, we can do the same thing here,

00:02:53.927 --> 00:02:56.010
or this second term here.

00:02:56.988 --> 00:03:01.216
So I wanna take the
derivative with respect to y

00:03:01.216 --> 00:03:04.327
of, I guess you could say the outside,

00:03:04.327 --> 00:03:05.577
of cosine of y,

00:03:07.692 --> 00:03:09.206
and then I would multiply that

00:03:09.206 --> 00:03:12.873
times the derivative
of y with respect to t.

00:03:14.264 --> 00:03:17.447
And then all of that is
going to be equal to what?

00:03:17.447 --> 00:03:20.742
Well, the derivative with
respect to t of a constant,

00:03:20.742 --> 00:03:22.162
square root of two is a constant,

00:03:22.162 --> 00:03:23.912
it's not gonna change as t changes,

00:03:23.912 --> 00:03:27.385
so its derivative, its
rate of change is zero.

00:03:27.385 --> 00:03:29.632
All right, so now we
just have to figure out

00:03:29.632 --> 00:03:31.357
all of these things.

00:03:31.357 --> 00:03:33.681
So first of all, the
derivative with respect to x

00:03:33.681 --> 00:03:38.277
of sine of x is cosine of
x times the derivative of x

00:03:38.277 --> 00:03:40.270
with respect to t, I'll
just write that out here.

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:42.207
The derivative of x with respect to t.

00:03:42.207 --> 00:03:44.964
And then we're going to have,
it's gonna be a plus here,

00:03:44.964 --> 00:03:47.157
the derivative of y with respect to t.

00:03:47.157 --> 00:03:51.010
So plus the derivative
of y with respect to t.

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:52.445
I'm just flopping the order here,

00:03:52.445 --> 00:03:54.467
so that this goes out front.

00:03:54.467 --> 00:03:58.372
Now, what's the derivative of
cosine of y with respect to y?

00:03:58.372 --> 00:04:01.336
Well, that is negative sine of y.

00:04:01.336 --> 00:04:05.265
And so, actually let me
just put a sine of y here,

00:04:05.265 --> 00:04:07.118
then I'm gonna have a negative.

00:04:07.118 --> 00:04:10.118
Erase this and put a negative there.

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:15.100
And that is all going to be equal to zero.

00:04:16.062 --> 00:04:18.743
And so what can we figure out now?

00:04:18.743 --> 00:04:21.785
They've told us that the
derivative of x with respect to t

00:04:21.785 --> 00:04:25.398
is equal to five, they tell
us that right over here.

00:04:25.398 --> 00:04:27.481
So this is equal to five.

00:04:29.088 --> 00:04:32.679
We wanna find the derivative
of y with respect to t.

00:04:32.679 --> 00:04:36.145
They tell us what y is, y is pi over four.

00:04:36.145 --> 00:04:40.312
This, y is pi over four, so
we know this is pi over four.

00:04:41.606 --> 00:04:43.791
And let's see, we have to figure out what,

00:04:43.791 --> 00:04:45.725
we still have two unknowns here.

00:04:45.725 --> 00:04:47.449
We don't know what x is and we don't know

00:04:47.449 --> 00:04:49.580
what the derivative of
y with respect to t is.

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:51.101
This is what we need to figure out.

00:04:51.101 --> 00:04:52.467
So what would x be?

00:04:52.467 --> 00:04:55.420
What would x be when y is pi over four?

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:56.439
Well, to figure that out,

00:04:56.439 --> 00:05:00.222
we can go back to this original
equation right over here.

00:05:00.222 --> 00:05:03.754
So when y is pi over four, you get,

00:05:03.754 --> 00:05:04.847
let me write down.

00:05:04.847 --> 00:05:05.680
Sine of x

00:05:07.391 --> 00:05:08.808
plus cosine of pi

00:05:10.716 --> 00:05:13.984
over four is equal to square root of two.

00:05:13.984 --> 00:05:15.901
Cosine of pi over four,

00:05:17.593 --> 00:05:20.936
we revert to our unit or we
think about our unit circle.

00:05:20.936 --> 00:05:22.558
We're in the first quadrant.

00:05:22.558 --> 00:05:24.160
If we think in degrees,
it's a 45 degree angle,

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:28.067
that's gonna be square
root of two over two.

00:05:28.067 --> 00:05:30.579
And so we can subtract
square root of two over two

00:05:30.579 --> 00:05:32.852
from both sides, which is going to give us

00:05:32.852 --> 00:05:37.709
sine of x is equal to, well,
if you take square root of two

00:05:37.709 --> 00:05:39.469
over two from square root of two,

00:05:39.469 --> 00:05:40.764
you're taking half of it away,

00:05:40.764 --> 00:05:42.223
so you're gonna have half of it left.

00:05:42.223 --> 00:05:44.709
So square root of two over two.

00:05:44.709 --> 00:05:48.718
And so, what x value, when
I take the sine of it,

00:05:48.718 --> 00:05:50.768
and remember, where the angle,

00:05:50.768 --> 00:05:52.360
if we're thinking when the
unit circle is going to be

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:54.775
in that first quadrant, x
is an angle in this case

00:05:54.775 --> 00:05:56.085
right over here.

00:05:56.085 --> 00:05:59.376
Well, that's going to be
once again pi over four.

00:05:59.376 --> 00:06:03.157
So this tells us that x
is equal to pi over four

00:06:03.157 --> 00:06:05.829
when y is equal to pi over four.

00:06:05.829 --> 00:06:09.475
And so we know that this
is pi over four as well.

00:06:09.475 --> 00:06:11.437
So let me just rewrite this,

00:06:11.437 --> 00:06:13.463
because it's getting a little bit messy.

00:06:13.463 --> 00:06:15.630
So we know that five times

00:06:17.521 --> 00:06:19.354
cosine of pi over four

00:06:22.214 --> 00:06:23.047
minus

00:06:24.268 --> 00:06:26.968
dy dt, the derivative
of y with respect to t,

00:06:26.968 --> 00:06:28.767
which is what we want to figure out,

00:06:28.767 --> 00:06:31.017
times sine of pi over four,

00:06:32.562 --> 00:06:33.979
is equal to zero,

00:06:35.398 --> 00:06:38.523
is equal to zero, and we
put some parentheses here,

00:06:38.523 --> 00:06:40.714
just to clarify things a little bit.

00:06:40.714 --> 00:06:43.454
All right, so let's see.

00:06:43.454 --> 00:06:45.108
Now, it's just a little bit of algebra.

00:06:45.108 --> 00:06:46.927
Cosine of pi over four,

00:06:46.927 --> 00:06:49.677
we already know is square
root of two over two.

00:06:49.677 --> 00:06:53.844
Sine of pi over four is also
square root of two over two.

00:06:54.754 --> 00:06:57.583
Now let's see, what if
we divide both sides

00:06:57.583 --> 00:07:00.878
of this equation by square
root of two over two?

00:07:00.878 --> 00:07:02.239
Well, what's that gonna give us?

00:07:02.239 --> 00:07:04.549
Well, then, this square
root of two over two

00:07:04.549 --> 00:07:05.884
divided by square root of two over,

00:07:05.884 --> 00:07:08.179
square root of two over two
divided square root of two

00:07:08.179 --> 00:07:10.035
over two is gonna be one.

00:07:10.035 --> 00:07:11.283
Square root of two over two divided

00:07:11.283 --> 00:07:13.232
square root of two over
two is gonna be one.

00:07:13.232 --> 00:07:15.495
And then zero divided by
square root of two over two

00:07:15.495 --> 00:07:17.751
is just still going to be zero.

00:07:17.751 --> 00:07:19.842
And so this whole thing simplifies to

00:07:19.842 --> 00:07:23.070
five times one, which is just five,

00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:26.627
minus the derivative
of y with respect to t

00:07:26.627 --> 00:07:28.044
is equal to zero,

00:07:29.558 --> 00:07:30.732
and so there you have it.

00:07:30.732 --> 00:07:33.648
You add the derivative of y
with respect to t to both sides,

00:07:33.648 --> 00:07:37.815
and we get the derivative of y
with respect to t is equal to

00:07:38.684 --> 00:07:42.294
five, when all of these
other things are true.

00:07:42.294 --> 00:07:44.656
When the derivative of x
with respect to t is five,

00:07:44.656 --> 00:07:47.999
and the derivative and y, I should say,

00:07:47.999 --> 00:07:50.166
is equal to pi over four.
