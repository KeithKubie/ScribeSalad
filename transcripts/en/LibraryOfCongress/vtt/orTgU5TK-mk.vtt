00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.630
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:12.330
&gt;&gt; Good afternoon and welcome.

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.270
Thanks for coming to this session.

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:16.570
I'm Amy Stolls.

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:18.550 position:56%
I'm the director of literature at
the National Endowment for the Arts,

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:20.860
which is one of the
sponsors or the main sponsor

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:23.680
of this stage for poetry and prose.

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:26.290 position:56%
And I'm thrilled to have Brad Watson

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:29.280
and Bill Roorbach with
us here today.

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:32.770
Bill from Maine -- western?

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:34.990
&gt;&gt; Bill Roorbach: Western Maine.

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:36.290
&gt;&gt; Western Maine.

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:40.900
And Brad from Wyoming
via Mississippi, Alabama,

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:42.200
a whole bunch of places, right?

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.220
&gt;&gt; Brad Watson: Yeah.

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:46.870
&gt;&gt; I should say -- and we met
in Mississippi many years ago.

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:49.230
So I still think of you
as that southern writer,

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.750
even though you're
up west, up north.

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.160
&gt;&gt; Brad Watson: Yeah.

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.460
&gt;&gt; So we're excited about this.

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:59.140
This is sort of an experiment for
us, that we are starting a new kind

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:03.230
of conversation between writers
where I'm going to introduce them

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:05.460
and then step off the stage happily

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.640
so that you can hear
them talk to each other.

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:08.940
They've known each other --

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:11.800
we put them together because you
have known -- you've met before.

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.790
I assume you like each
other, so I hope.

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:16.380
And you'll -- yeah, well, okay.

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.690
I like you, so I'm rooting for
the good conversations there.

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:24.810
I will also say that they
are both NEI fellows,

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.340
which means they received
$25,000 fellowships

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:28.710
through the National
Endowment for the Arts,

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.220
which is a really competitive
process

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:36.640
of selecting anonymously talent,
particularly emerging talent.

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:41.310 position:56%
And we get 1,800 applications and we
only give between 35 and 40 awards.

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.670
So you have before
you two NEI fellows.

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.470
I --

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.560
[ Applause ]

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:56.980
So Bill Roorbach, an
award-winning author of nine books?

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:58.920
You keep count?

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.930 position:56%
Yeah, of fiction, short stories, and
novels, a memoir, a book of craft.

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.770
He is going to talk
about his latest today,

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:08.710
<i>The Girl of the Lake</i>,
a book of short stories.

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:10.010
Fantastic.

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:12.000
You also might also know him from
<i>The Remedy of Love</i>, was a finalist

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.670
for the Kirkus prize; or the
best-selling <i>Life Among Giants</i>,

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:18.380
another novel, winner of
the Maine Literary Award;

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:21.520
a book of short stories, <i>Big Bend</i>.

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:25.640
His memoir is called <i>Temple
Stream</i>; and among other books.

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:30.950
But <i>The Girl of the Lake</i>,
this latest and fantastic book

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:33.240
of short stories,
critically-acclaimed,

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:36.000
Booklist starred review,
for example, said,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.330 position:56%
"Each meticulously chiseled down and
polished tale contains enough plot,

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:44.690
character development, and
emotion to fill a novel.

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:48.850 position:56%
These stories, with their smart and
funny dialogue, characters both wise

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:53.260 position:56%
and fallible are sure to capture
the reader's imagination and heart."

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.740
<i>Publisher's Weekly</i> said
of it, "The ten generous,

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:59.860
daring short stories range from
tricky romance to dark comedy,

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:01.170
to breath-taking adventure.

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:07.250
And they start off ordinary and
then turn magically strange."

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:10.280
So I'm excited to hear
him talk about that.

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:13.190
Brad Watson is the
Guggenheim fellow,

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:16.040
also author of four
critically-acclaimed books.

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:20.940
He will be talking about
<i>Miss Jane</i>, his novel,

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:22.980
made the National Book
Award long list.

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:25.190
You might also him from
<i>The Heaven of Mercury</i>,

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:29.260
which was a finalist novel
for the National Book Award.

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.070
He has his book of short
stories <i>Aliens in the Prime</i>

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:35.010
<i>of Their Lives</i>, the finalist for
the PEN/Faulkner Award for fiction.

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:37.660
And <i>Last Days of the
Dog-Men</i>, which was his first

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:40.280
and won the Sue Kaufman
award for First Fiction

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:43.570
from the American Academy
of Arts and Letters.

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:46.190
And he teaches at the
University of Wyoming --

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:50.200 position:56%
I hope I'm getting this all right --
in Laramie and was recently selected

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:51.570
to receive the Harper Lee Award

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:56.030
for Alabama's Distinguished
Writer of the Year for 2017.

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:59.170
And <i>Library Journal</i>, a
star-review critical acclaim --

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:01.470
I'm just giving you a taste --

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:05.210
writes, "As Watson arcs through the
story of Jane's life and sensitive,

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:08.550
beautifully precise prose, we
are both absorbed and humbled."

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:12.140
And I'm going to read a
paragraph from a terrific review

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:16.570
in the <i>New York Times</i> book review
because it says a lot, quote,

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:17.870
"The complexity and drama

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:21.610
of Watson's gorgeous work
here is life's as well.

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:25.330
Sometimes physical realities
expand us, sometimes trap.

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:28.650
Sometimes heroism lies in
combating our helplessness,

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:30.490
sometimes in accepting it.

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:34.220
A writer of profound emotional
depths, Watson does not lie

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:37.140
to his readers, so
neither does his Jane.

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:40.640
She never stops longing for a
wholeness she may never know,

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:43.430
but she is determined that
her citizenship in the world,

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:47.200
however onerous be dragged into
the light and there be lived

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:51.190
without apology or
perfection or pity."

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:54.760
And with that, I'm going to
step down and let them to it.

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:56.060
Thank you.

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:57.360
&gt;&gt; Bill Roorbach: Thank you.

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:59.160
&gt;&gt; Brad Watson: Thank you, Amy.

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:01.830
[ Applause ]

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:03.130
&gt;&gt; Brad Watson: Hello, Bill.

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:04.620
&gt;&gt; Bill Roorbach: Hi, Brad.

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:06.800
&gt;&gt; Brad Watson: It was great
having brunch with you today.

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:08.740
&gt;&gt; Bill Roorbach: It was great
having bunch with you today.

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:11.230
&gt;&gt; Brad Watson: Bill created
a new dish at The Burn.

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:14.010
Just wanted to say that.

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:15.310
[ Laughter ]

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:19.140
&gt;&gt; Bill Roorbach: I just had
them put an egg on my tacos.

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:22.440
&gt;&gt; Brad Watson: Everybody
was impressed, though.

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:23.740
&gt;&gt; Bill Roorbach: So
a couple of weeks --

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:25.840
I don't know, months ago actually,

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:31.030
my Aunt Patsy called
me, my mother's -- oh.

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:35.820
[ Laughter ]

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:37.120
Someone says they can't hear me.

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:40.020
&gt;&gt; Brad Watson: Is that
because your mic is drooping?

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:45.030
You might have to button
another button or something.

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:47.050
[ Laughter ]

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:49.240
&gt;&gt; Bill Roorbach: I appreciate
the sartorial approach.

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:51.470
[ Laughter ]

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:55.660
I'll put it up higher.

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:58.020
Is that better?

00:05:58.020 --> 00:05:59.320
Oh, good.

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:00.620
&gt;&gt; Brad Watson: It's blocking.

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:01.950
The shirt's blocking it.

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:03.980
[ Laughter ]

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:05.280
&gt;&gt; Bill Roorbach: I'm just
going to take my shirt off.

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:09.200
&gt;&gt; Brad Watson: Do you need
some help there [Laughs]?

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:10.500
&gt;&gt; Bill Roorbach: Well.

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:12.490
[ Laughter ]

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:17.250
I like this, this is good.

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:20.930
A couple of months ago,
my Aunt Patsy called me.

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:27.310
She's close to 90, she's the last
of my mother's surviving siblings.

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:30.100
There were eight of them
-- one died in childhood,

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:32.670
and the others have
made it all the way

00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:36.000
to very old age, one
by one passing away.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.460
It's very sad.

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:39.990
But Aunt Patsy called me.

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:43.550
Well, there were two --
Bessie's still around, too.

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:49.830
So Aunt Patsy called me and said,
"Bill, I'm sorry to call you

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:53.410
and tell you this, but your
Aunt Bessie has passed away."

00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:55.810
And I was like, "Oh no."

00:06:55.810 --> 00:06:59.230
And I just had this terrible
sad feeling and guilt

00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:01.340
because I hadn't called
her for a while.

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:06.190
And I thought, "I meant to call
her, like, the Sunday before

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:08.180
and I just had forgotten."

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:13.100
And so anyway, I called her son,
one of my cousins, and said,

00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:15.020
"I'm so sorry to hear
about your mom."

00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:16.320
And he goes, "What?

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:17.620
What happened?"

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:22.040 position:56%
And I go, "Well, Patsy called me
and said that your mother had died."

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:23.650
And he goes, "Oh, no.

00:07:23.650 --> 00:07:24.950
Oh my God.

00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:27.150
I got to get down there."

00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:32.230
And then a couple of days later,
he calls me back and says, "Bill,

00:07:32.230 --> 00:07:35.310
I went down to Palo Alto" --
they're out in California --

00:07:35.310 --> 00:07:37.510
"and my mother was fine."

00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:40.260
[ Laughter ]

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:42.210
And so I called Aunt Patsy

00:07:42.210 --> 00:07:46.130
and she said she didn't remember
calling anyone, you know?

00:07:46.130 --> 00:07:50.210
So then Aunt Patsy calls me another
couple of days later and says,

00:07:50.210 --> 00:07:55.140
"Bill, I'm so sorry that I
told you Aunt Bessie was dead.

00:07:55.140 --> 00:07:57.030
I had a dream that she was dead."

00:07:57.030 --> 00:07:59.040
[ Laughter ]

00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:01.660
"And I called simply everyone."

00:08:01.660 --> 00:08:05.310
So -- so --

00:08:05.310 --> 00:08:06.960
&gt;&gt; Brad Watson: So that's
where you're from [Laughs].

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:10.280
&gt;&gt; Bill Roorbach: That's
where I'm from.

00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:14.070
So they all had an aunt named
Aunt Molly who had been stepped

00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:19.380
on by a horse when she was a little
girl and her face was crushed.

00:08:19.380 --> 00:08:23.090
So they grew up with this
aunt who -- she survived --

00:08:23.090 --> 00:08:26.070
but they grew up with this
special person, you know,

00:08:26.070 --> 00:08:29.350
who nevertheless led
a fairly normal life.

00:08:29.350 --> 00:08:37.170
And I just felt like Brad reading
about Miss Jane with her challenge,

00:08:37.170 --> 00:08:45.090
it just -- and the milieu,
too, the era; all the secrets

00:08:45.090 --> 00:08:49.920
that attended any health thing;
and the sense of family and how

00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:52.100
that settled into a place.

00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:55.090
I just felt so connected
to your book.

00:08:55.090 --> 00:08:57.830
I think because of my
family's story but also

00:08:57.830 --> 00:08:59.790 position:56%
because it's such an American story.

00:08:59.790 --> 00:09:08.960
What -- is Miss Jane based
on someone like my Molly?

00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:17.210
&gt;&gt; Brad Watson: She was inspired
by a great aunt, my mother's aunt.

00:09:17.210 --> 00:09:19.280
And -- but I never knew her.

00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:23.500
I saw her -- my great Aunt Jane --

00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:26.770
once when I was a little boy
when we were at my grandmother's

00:09:26.770 --> 00:09:33.710
for our weekly Sunday gathering
for my mother's family.

00:09:33.710 --> 00:09:37.010
She was helped into the
house by another uncle.

00:09:37.010 --> 00:09:38.970
She was wearing Sunday black.

00:09:38.970 --> 00:09:40.270
She was very frail.

00:09:40.270 --> 00:09:43.670
And everyone said,
"Well, that's Aunt Jane."

00:09:43.670 --> 00:09:51.050
And it was known somehow that,
you know, something is wrong,

00:09:51.050 --> 00:09:52.350
you know, with Aunt Jane.

00:09:52.350 --> 00:09:53.650
&gt;&gt; Bill Roorbach: Just something?

00:09:53.650 --> 00:09:54.950
&gt;&gt; Brad Watson: Just something.

00:09:54.950 --> 00:09:57.760
You know, over the years,
you know, my mom said --

00:09:57.760 --> 00:10:02.660
let me know that for her
entire life she was incontinent

00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:05.560
and that she never
married and had children.

00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:08.930
And so it had something
-- it was some sort of --

00:10:08.930 --> 00:10:13.240
apparently some sort of urogenital
anomaly, you know, birth defect.

00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:18.860 position:56%
But no one knew any details, at
least no one alive knew any details.

00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:21.000
And there were no medical
records or anything like that.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:22.300
I was inspired.

00:10:22.300 --> 00:10:23.980
I was always fascinated by her

00:10:23.980 --> 00:10:27.230
because everyone said she was a
really cheerful person in spite

00:10:27.230 --> 00:10:30.040
of having to live with things
that most people don't.

00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:34.480
And I was going through a box of
photographs one day with my mom

00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:36.660
at home, old photographs,
and I saw a picture

00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:42.190 position:56%
of this attractive young woman or
older teenage girl wearing a sun hat

00:10:42.190 --> 00:10:43.490
and looking back at the camera.

00:10:43.490 --> 00:10:45.730
And she had this sort of
coquettish look, you know?

00:10:45.730 --> 00:10:47.030
I said, "Who's that?"

00:10:47.030 --> 00:10:49.350
She said, "Well, that's Aunt Jane."

00:10:49.350 --> 00:10:53.730
I said, "It almost looks like
she's flirting with someone."

00:10:53.730 --> 00:10:58.680
And she said -- my
mom said, "Well, yeah.

00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:02.220
She was -- Aunt Jane was
really popular with the boys."

00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:07.580
I said, "Well, how did
she manage that, you know,

00:11:07.580 --> 00:11:11.250
with her condition in those days?"

00:11:11.250 --> 00:11:14.010
She said, "I have no idea."

00:11:14.010 --> 00:11:15.310
[ Laughter ]

00:11:15.310 --> 00:11:18.400
And she said, "But she used
to go to the dances up there

00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:20.760
in the Damascus community where
she grew up in the country,"

00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:25.250
and where my mom grew up
also right across the road.

00:11:25.250 --> 00:11:27.400
I said, "Went to dances?

00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:30.500
And you told me that you got in
trouble as a child for laughing

00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:33.800
because she squeaked when she
walked because of rubber underwear,

00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:37.480
protective garments she had to
wear, and she went to dances?"

00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:40.420
I said, "How did she do that?"

00:11:40.420 --> 00:11:43.120
"Oh, I have no idea."

00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:44.890
And I started thinking about it.

00:11:44.890 --> 00:11:46.930
I thought -- it made
me think, "Okay,

00:11:46.930 --> 00:11:50.930
this is not just a poor
old maid Aunt Jane."

00:11:50.930 --> 00:11:52.230
She had a life.

00:11:52.230 --> 00:11:58.350
She was a real person and started
trying to see beyond just her

00:11:58.350 --> 00:12:02.200
as the other, you know, the
person with the condition,

00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:03.610
and try to imagine a life.

00:12:03.610 --> 00:12:06.490
Unfortunately, I had to imagine
more than I thought I would.

00:12:06.490 --> 00:12:09.320
I thought there would be a
lot of great family stories,

00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:11.320
there would be records,
more photographs,

00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:15.070
someone would know
what her condition was.

00:12:15.070 --> 00:12:16.370
And no one did.

00:12:16.370 --> 00:12:17.670
No one did.

00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:19.860 position:56%
I basically ended up having to make
up just about everything, which was,

00:12:19.860 --> 00:12:23.020
of course, just a novel and it
was better in the end for that.

00:12:23.020 --> 00:12:26.490
&gt;&gt; Bill Roorbach: Well, it reads
as the truest of true, you know?

00:12:26.490 --> 00:12:31.160
You found your way into
first the young woman --

00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:33.980
the kid's life and then
the young woman's life.

00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:38.700
My favorite passages are as
she's coming of age, you know,

00:12:38.700 --> 00:12:42.690
and starting to grapple with
sexuality and attractions to boys

00:12:42.690 --> 00:12:46.400
and yet she doesn't have the
usual sexual equipment, you know?

00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:47.700
&gt;&gt; Brad Watson: Yeah.

00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:50.080
&gt;&gt; Bill Roorbach: So I
thought it was, you know,

00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:57.550
she's kind of the female Jake
Barnes for our time, you know?

00:12:57.550 --> 00:13:01.370
But it was -- it was --

00:13:01.370 --> 00:13:03.780
&gt;&gt; Brad Watson: Well, as I
was saying earlier, of course,

00:13:03.780 --> 00:13:08.150 position:56%
the thing that finally worked itself
out in a good way I thought was

00:13:08.150 --> 00:13:12.370
that her condition is such that
she has everything she's supposed

00:13:12.370 --> 00:13:13.670
to have.

00:13:13.670 --> 00:13:14.990
&gt;&gt; Bill Roorbach: She
has all the internal --

00:13:14.990 --> 00:13:19.160
&gt;&gt; Brad Watson: Without access
to it and no surgical ability

00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:21.620
in those days to correct
it, to bring everything.

00:13:21.620 --> 00:13:23.130
&gt;&gt; Bill Roorbach: There's
no way to fix that?

00:13:23.130 --> 00:13:24.510
&gt;&gt; Brad Watson: No way
to fix it in that time.

00:13:24.510 --> 00:13:27.910
In fact, my great Aunt
was born in 1888;

00:13:27.910 --> 00:13:30.500
Jane in the book is born in 1915.

00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:36.650
And the first successful correction
of that surgery happened in '85.

00:13:36.650 --> 00:13:39.180
My great aunt died in '78.

00:13:39.180 --> 00:13:44.060
And in the book, Jane is --

00:13:44.060 --> 00:13:48.900
this is well into her 60's when she
gets news there's a possibly of it.

00:13:48.900 --> 00:13:50.200
So [inaudible].

00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:55.210
But speaking of Jane and
-- another thing of my mom.

00:13:55.210 --> 00:14:02.020
So my mom [Laughs], I said, "I
want to go find Aunt Jane's grave."

00:14:02.020 --> 00:14:03.320
She said, "Oh, okay.

00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:04.620
I know where it is."

00:14:04.620 --> 00:14:08.370 position:56%
She told me where it is in the
cemetery by this tree on this hill."

00:14:08.370 --> 00:14:11.240
Okay. I went there and
I looked and I found it.

00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:13.710
I couldn't see Jane Clay anywhere.

00:14:13.710 --> 00:14:16.230
I went back and I said,
"I couldn't find it.

00:14:16.230 --> 00:14:19.970
There's a headstone for a
woman named Mary Ellis Clay

00:14:19.970 --> 00:14:21.320
with about the right dates on it."

00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:22.620
She said, "Oh, yeah.

00:14:22.620 --> 00:14:24.030
That's her."

00:14:24.030 --> 00:14:26.130
[ Laughter ]

00:14:26.130 --> 00:14:29.760
I said, "Well, it doesn't
say Mary Ellis Jane Clay."

00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:31.560
I said, "Why did they
call her Jane?"

00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:34.510
She said, "I don't know."

00:14:34.510 --> 00:14:40.440
[ Laughter ]

00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:41.740 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Bill Roorbach: That gets me, too.

00:14:41.740 --> 00:14:43.270
&gt;&gt; Brad Watson: So
that's where I'm from.

00:14:43.270 --> 00:14:47.160 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Bill Roorbach: Yeah, that's where
-- Aunt Patsy's real name in Laura.

00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:48.880
What -- why --

00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:51.960
&gt;&gt; Brad Watson: I had a aunt
named Laura, a great aunt.

00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:53.260
&gt;&gt; Bill Roorbach: You did?

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:54.560
A Laura?

00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:55.860
&gt;&gt; Brad Watson: Yeah, a Laura.

00:14:55.860 --> 00:14:57.160
Yeah.

00:14:57.160 --> 00:14:58.460
&gt;&gt; Bill Roorbach: So did you have
to do research to find a condition

00:14:58.460 --> 00:15:01.950
that you could reasonably assume
was the condition of your aunt

00:15:01.950 --> 00:15:04.420
and then go ahead and
fictionalize from there?

00:15:04.420 --> 00:15:06.010
&gt;&gt; Brad Watson: Yeah, all
the most common conditions,

00:15:06.010 --> 00:15:13.410
I read the giant tome published
in about 1940 by Dr. Hugh Young,

00:15:13.410 --> 00:15:16.540
who was a peripheral offstage
character in the book.

00:15:16.540 --> 00:15:18.920
He was a pioneering
urologist at John's Hopkins.

00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:22.400
And there was nothing in
there that really worked,

00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:24.370
you know, seemed to be right.

00:15:24.370 --> 00:15:27.380
And all the most common
conditions I could find,

00:15:27.380 --> 00:15:28.800
none of them seemed to be right.

00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:33.850
Most of them involved a lot of
infections, and constant trips

00:15:33.850 --> 00:15:36.440
to the doctor, and
maybe an early death.

00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:38.950 position:56%
And my aunt did not have to do that,

00:15:38.950 --> 00:15:43.210
didn't suffer in that particular
way, and lived a long life.

00:15:43.210 --> 00:15:46.100
So I finally found
this one and it fit.

00:15:46.100 --> 00:15:50.000
And this was something -- oh,
once I said to my mom, I said,

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:53.050
"Do you think she was intersexual?"

00:15:53.050 --> 00:15:57.010 position:56%
You know? "No, no, she was a woman."

00:15:57.010 --> 00:16:01.670
My mother was indignant that
I would ask that question.

00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:05.410
So I said okay, I'll go
with that assumption.

00:16:05.410 --> 00:16:10.300
And this condition also happens
only in women, in females.

00:16:10.300 --> 00:16:12.650
So everything kind
of -- I finally --

00:16:12.650 --> 00:16:16.050
it took a long time
because it's pretty rare.

00:16:16.050 --> 00:16:18.740
And it took a long time to find
something that not only seemed

00:16:18.740 --> 00:16:23.450
to be right on a character based
on my aunt, and I wanted it

00:16:23.450 --> 00:16:26.200
to be a condition that
would create a life that was

00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:33.950
like the one I could try to
imagine her having and that --

00:16:33.950 --> 00:16:36.020
I'm sorry, I lost that thought.

00:16:36.020 --> 00:16:38.080
&gt;&gt; Bill Roorbach: I love
the doctor you invent, too,

00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:43.150
because he's so caring
and so interested.

00:16:43.150 --> 00:16:47.180
It's a scientific anomaly,
so that catches his interest.

00:16:47.180 --> 00:16:50.810
But he's so -- he offers
all of the caring and love

00:16:50.810 --> 00:16:53.760
that her family doesn't
know how to offer.

00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:57.440
So just great characters
all the way through.

00:16:57.440 --> 00:17:00.310
&gt;&gt; Brad Watson: After he loses his
wife -- even before that, though,

00:17:00.310 --> 00:17:02.090
because his marriage
is not so great.

00:17:02.090 --> 00:17:03.390
&gt;&gt; Bill Roorbach: Yeah.

00:17:03.390 --> 00:17:06.000
&gt;&gt; Brad Watson: Which leads to him
later saying to her that, you know,

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.090
sometimes some people
should follow their nature.

00:17:08.090 --> 00:17:11.560
Some people aren't
-- should be alone.

00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:15.450
It's not necessarily such
a terrible thing, you know?

00:17:15.450 --> 00:17:17.040
It can be a good thing.

00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:18.340
&gt;&gt; Bill Roorbach: It
can be a good thing.

00:17:18.340 --> 00:17:19.640
&gt;&gt; Brad Watson: Yeah, yeah.

00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:21.050
&gt;&gt; Bill Roorbach: And that
brings us to she lives on a farm

00:17:21.050 --> 00:17:24.190
that feels so big and so real.

00:17:24.190 --> 00:17:30.360
And she has places on the farm like
the river that she can go out to

00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:31.970
and the field, rather, where --

00:17:31.970 --> 00:17:33.270
&gt;&gt; Brad Watson: Yeah, her meadow.

00:17:33.270 --> 00:17:34.570
&gt;&gt; Bill Roorbach: Her meadow.

00:17:34.570 --> 00:17:35.870
&gt;&gt; Brad Watson: Her meadow.

00:17:35.870 --> 00:17:37.170
Her meadow.

00:17:37.170 --> 00:17:38.470
&gt;&gt; Bill Roorbach: Yeah.

00:17:38.470 --> 00:17:40.330
&gt;&gt; Brad Watson: Well, you know,
I've been in Wyoming 12 years now.

00:17:40.330 --> 00:17:43.300
When I was writing <i>Heaven to
Mercury</i> set in the same --

00:17:43.300 --> 00:17:48.350
set in the town near where Jane
is set, I was living in Boston.

00:17:48.350 --> 00:17:52.610
But I had more recently
lived in the South.

00:17:52.610 --> 00:17:55.180
And also, I was writing
about a small urban area

00:17:55.180 --> 00:17:57.170
that I grew up in, in Newell.

00:17:57.170 --> 00:18:00.370
And now I had been in
Wyoming, you know, for ten --

00:18:00.370 --> 00:18:03.680
well, when I got to writing
the drafts in earnest --

00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:05.770
because it took me a long time and
a lot of false starts to figure

00:18:05.770 --> 00:18:10.480
out how to write it -- but I think
it was 2013 or so when I figured

00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:12.790
out how to write it, and
there were many drafts to go.

00:18:12.790 --> 00:18:14.230
But I started.

00:18:14.230 --> 00:18:17.860
And by that time I had
been out there already

00:18:17.860 --> 00:18:19.690
for seven or eight years.

00:18:19.690 --> 00:18:23.440
And plus, this was a farm, and
I did not grow up on a farm.

00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:28.740
So I would go home and go to the
land where my mother grew up,

00:18:28.740 --> 00:18:34.070 position:56%
which is now covered in trees and
all kind of overgrowth, undergrowth.

00:18:34.070 --> 00:18:39.570
And I had visited there
when there was still ruins.

00:18:39.570 --> 00:18:42.860
And so I knew where to go in
the woods to be in that spot.

00:18:42.860 --> 00:18:47.090
And my mother had told me -- I
had gone there and I'd say, "Okay,

00:18:47.090 --> 00:18:49.870
well, here was the house.

00:18:49.870 --> 00:18:52.960
This is all woods, and
where was the cattle pond?

00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:56.040
I know where -- you know,
where's the swimming pond?

00:18:56.040 --> 00:18:58.180
Where's the fishing pond?"

00:18:58.180 --> 00:19:02.300
She'd said say, "Well, we planted
tobacco here, a little corn here.

00:19:02.300 --> 00:19:04.270
There was a large cornfield.

00:19:04.270 --> 00:19:06.570
There was a little cotton
we had here, you know?

00:19:06.570 --> 00:19:09.190
And there was the shed and
there was the barn," and so on.

00:19:09.190 --> 00:19:12.900
And so I had to just construct
kind of a, you know, this --

00:19:12.900 --> 00:19:15.410
I drew pictures for
myself and then I would go.

00:19:15.410 --> 00:19:18.470
And I would go to the place
and just smell it and feel it,

00:19:18.470 --> 00:19:22.770
you know what I mean, in the
air and listen to bird song.

00:19:22.770 --> 00:19:24.490
&gt;&gt; Bill Roorbach: And
it's kind of a dream

00:19:24.490 --> 00:19:27.210
that grows in your imagination.

00:19:27.210 --> 00:19:28.510
&gt;&gt; Brad Watson: Yeah.

00:19:28.510 --> 00:19:31.200
But I had to go and be there
because it wasn't as easy

00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:34.040
to conjure without the visits.

00:19:34.040 --> 00:19:37.750
It wasn't easy to get
it -- fix it in my head.

00:19:37.750 --> 00:19:43.550 position:56%
You know, you spend a long -- you
go through several drafts, you know,

00:19:43.550 --> 00:19:47.860
and part of the effort in
those drafts is getting

00:19:47.860 --> 00:19:50.810
to where you can really see through
the characters, through the eyes

00:19:50.810 --> 00:19:52.930
of those characters
to see that place.

00:19:52.930 --> 00:19:56.820
And then it becomes -- then
you stop thinking about it,

00:19:56.820 --> 00:19:58.340
that you're not doing
it consciously,

00:19:58.340 --> 00:20:01.800
and then you're probably pretty
close to being in the groove.

00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:03.100
&gt;&gt; Bill Roorbach: At that point.

00:20:03.100 --> 00:20:04.400
&gt;&gt; Brad Watson: But
it takes a while.

00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:05.700
&gt;&gt; Bill Roorbach: Once
you're imagining it?

00:20:05.700 --> 00:20:07.000
&gt;&gt; Brad Watson: Yeah.

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:08.300
&gt;&gt; Bill Roorbach: Do you want
to read a little bit for us or?

00:20:08.300 --> 00:20:09.600
&gt;&gt; Brad Watson: I can read
now or we can talk some

00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:10.900
about yours or I don't know.

00:20:10.900 --> 00:20:12.370
We can do that, and then
we'll talk all about you.

00:20:12.370 --> 00:20:13.670
How about that?

00:20:13.670 --> 00:20:14.970
&gt;&gt; Bill Roorbach: Sound good to me.

00:20:14.970 --> 00:20:16.270
&gt;&gt; Brad Watson: Okay.

00:20:16.270 --> 00:20:17.570
[ Laughter ]

00:20:17.570 --> 00:20:18.870
&gt;&gt; Bill Roorbach: I'd
love to hear you read.

00:20:18.870 --> 00:20:23.510
&gt;&gt; Brad Watson: I don't
want to take too much time.

00:20:23.510 --> 00:20:24.810
Okay. This is -- all right.

00:20:24.810 --> 00:20:28.160
So I had to imagine how my
great aunt might have gone

00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:29.520
to these dances.

00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:36.000
And I thought, "Well, how did
she go without having an accident

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:37.700
as she calls it in the book?"

00:20:37.700 --> 00:20:40.740
And so I just thought, I
said, "Well, what would I do?"

00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:49.510
And this is about that,
her first dance.

00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:55.850
For an entire two days before the
evening of the dance, she fasted.

00:20:55.850 --> 00:20:59.100
First thing on the first morning
she dosed herself with castor oil,

00:20:59.100 --> 00:21:02.750 position:56%
followed by a little buttermilk just
to have something on her stomach

00:21:02.750 --> 00:21:06.000
and stayed in the privy until
she felt herself emptied out.

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:09.330
She spent the next entire day
beneath the tree in the middle

00:21:09.330 --> 00:21:12.910
of the pecan grove or beside the
fishing pond or lying in the middle

00:21:12.910 --> 00:21:15.290
of her favorite little
clearing in the woods.

00:21:15.290 --> 00:21:17.500
She would take along a
piece of bread, maybe bacon

00:21:17.500 --> 00:21:21.650
but scatter the bread for the
birds, toss the bacon to the fish,

00:21:21.650 --> 00:21:28.260 position:56%
not thinking -- just being or simply
being Jane as when she was younger.

00:21:28.260 --> 00:21:29.930
On the first day she
would allow herself

00:21:29.930 --> 00:21:32.370
to sip a little water
from time to time.

00:21:32.370 --> 00:21:35.640
At some point in the second
day there would be an almost

00:21:35.640 --> 00:21:39.060
hallucinatory clarity in her
vision, in the presence of things

00:21:39.060 --> 00:21:44.120
around her, in the sounds of birds
and farm work and dogs barking,

00:21:44.120 --> 00:21:47.340
sounds of livestock
and people talking.

00:21:47.340 --> 00:21:50.950
Even the breezes gently rustling
leaves in the trees made a sound

00:21:50.950 --> 00:21:53.810
that seemed to fill her
mind in an intoxicating way,

00:21:53.810 --> 00:21:57.330
as if the very tips of the leaves
were tickling her awareness.

00:21:57.330 --> 00:22:01.400
The temptation of the senses that
she allowed to wash through her,

00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:04.500 position:56%
to flush her with calm anticipation.

00:22:04.500 --> 00:22:06.530
This had not just a little to do

00:22:06.530 --> 00:22:10.520
with her strange alluring
grace in those days.

00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:12.690
She walked about in such
a dreamy, distracted state

00:22:12.690 --> 00:22:15.800
that her mother let her know that
she'd check her laudanum bottle

00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:18.510
to make sure the girl
had not got into it.

00:22:18.510 --> 00:22:21.050
[ Laughter ]

00:22:21.050 --> 00:22:24.780
The afternoon before her first
dance her mother said to her,

00:22:24.780 --> 00:22:27.650
"You can't get too friendly
with these boys, Jane."

00:22:27.650 --> 00:22:31.280
Jane said nothing, just
listening, oddly calm in her way

00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:34.680
that her mother seemed
to find unsettling.

00:22:34.680 --> 00:22:37.250
So she went on, "Do you understand?

00:22:37.250 --> 00:22:39.290
You've long known it."

00:22:39.290 --> 00:22:42.920
When Jane only smiled, her stood up
in mild exasperation to walk away

00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:46.150
and as she did, she said,
"You have to be careful.

00:22:46.150 --> 00:22:49.630
It might not only be
you that gets hurt."

00:22:49.630 --> 00:22:53.800
"But Dr. Thompson said he believes
they'll be able to fix me one day.

00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:56.930
I could have a regular
life with a man someday,"

00:22:56.930 --> 00:23:00.070
though he hadn't said exactly that.

00:23:00.070 --> 00:23:03.600
Her mother stopped and looked
at her long and steady,

00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:08.800
"Believing is a matter of
faith," she said, "not certainty."

00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:11.710
Jane had never seen the look
in her eye she saw then.

00:23:11.710 --> 00:23:13.010
She looked almost empty.

00:23:13.010 --> 00:23:16.150
And for the first time Jane
could remember she saw her mother

00:23:16.150 --> 00:23:19.290
as a woman whom life had made
not just hard but also exhausted

00:23:19.290 --> 00:23:22.960
and plain, older looking
than her years.

00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:26.140
Then as if she could read the
unspoken words in Jane's eyes,

00:23:26.140 --> 00:23:28.690
her mother's expression
darkened again.

00:23:28.690 --> 00:23:32.230
Her own eyes glistened
about to shed tears,

00:23:32.230 --> 00:23:35.740
"What would you know
about life with a man?

00:23:35.740 --> 00:23:37.190
And what of your little experience

00:23:37.190 --> 00:23:41.830
in this world would make you
think it such a fine thing?"

00:23:41.830 --> 00:23:45.110
Jane watched her go out the back
door, feeling more sad for her

00:23:45.110 --> 00:23:47.440
than abashed at being abraded.

00:23:47.440 --> 00:23:48.780
Her mother's words weren't able

00:23:48.780 --> 00:23:51.240
to dispel the deeply
calm pleasure she felt

00:23:51.240 --> 00:23:54.740
in these new days, this new self.

00:23:54.740 --> 00:23:58.460
She didn't wear a diaper to the
dance, only a little padding as if

00:23:58.460 --> 00:24:00.760
for possible light menstruation

00:24:00.760 --> 00:24:02.800
so that there were no
bulky undergarments

00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:06.380
to interrupt her slim figure
or graceful movements.

00:24:06.380 --> 00:24:09.330
And she made herself a light, more
slim-fitting dress and wore a pair

00:24:09.330 --> 00:24:12.010
of shoes her father had
bought for her in town

00:24:12.010 --> 00:24:15.960
after drawing an outlined figure of
her foot on a sheet of school paper

00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:18.300
to show the shoe salesman.

00:24:18.300 --> 00:24:22.080
She attended two dances before
any of the boys got up the courage

00:24:22.080 --> 00:24:25.820
or got past their bashful
curiosity to ask her to dance.

00:24:25.820 --> 00:24:29.260 position:56%
But that was good, since it
allowed her to study their movements

00:24:29.260 --> 00:24:31.520
so she could mimic them later.

00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:34.620
And then finally, Elijah
Key did ask her.

00:24:34.620 --> 00:24:37.800
She'd seen him standing against the
wall in the shadows of dim lights

00:24:37.800 --> 00:24:41.570
from the Japanese lanterns the
organizers had hung in the hall.

00:24:41.570 --> 00:24:44.460
He wasn't wearing his glasses and
probably had no idea she was there.

00:24:44.460 --> 00:24:50.130
A little later she saw him again,
spectacles on, looking at her.

00:24:50.130 --> 00:24:52.420
Maybe someone had mentioned her.

00:24:52.420 --> 00:24:56.610
Seeing her seemed to surprise
him into something like shyness.

00:24:56.610 --> 00:25:00.050
Then when she let her attention
wander that second night,

00:25:00.050 --> 00:25:03.980
wander as it tended to do in
her state of mind, she looked up

00:25:03.980 --> 00:25:05.580
and there he was, standing
out in front of her

00:25:05.580 --> 00:25:07.490
and holding out his hand.

00:25:07.490 --> 00:25:09.160
After he danced with her,

00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:12.840
some of the other boys also began
asking her out onto the floor.

00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:16.240
She felt something that she'd
never felt before then --

00:25:16.240 --> 00:25:20.930
the pleasure of flirtation, though
she didn't even know the word.

00:25:20.930 --> 00:25:23.910
The boys liked her
and she liked them.

00:25:23.910 --> 00:25:27.430
But if any one of them seemed
about to like her too much,

00:25:27.430 --> 00:25:29.720
she had her way of
withdrawing just enough,

00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:34.110
like a scrap of paper the wind
keeps blowing just out of reach.

00:25:34.110 --> 00:25:36.530
Her oddly calm, distracted
stated seemed

00:25:36.530 --> 00:25:39.780
to fascinate them into
stupid muteness.

00:25:39.780 --> 00:25:42.100
And when she would fix
her gaze upon her partner,

00:25:42.100 --> 00:25:43.910
that boy looked dumbstruck

00:25:43.910 --> 00:25:46.940
as if thinking he might
be falling in love.

00:25:46.940 --> 00:25:50.370
But she was so obviously
democratic in the dispensation

00:25:50.370 --> 00:25:53.660
of her new strange charm
that none of them was moved

00:25:53.660 --> 00:25:56.800
to any sort of foolish words.

00:25:56.800 --> 00:26:00.470
She could see Elijah watching her
when she danced with other boys,

00:26:00.470 --> 00:26:03.960
her light, thin figure in her
homemade dress, her straight,

00:26:03.960 --> 00:26:09.320
dark hair and long and loose,
her darkling blue eyes.

00:26:09.320 --> 00:26:11.950
She could the stick-thin
figure of her father, too,

00:26:11.950 --> 00:26:15.210
hat held in the hand
in the moonlit doorway.

00:26:15.210 --> 00:26:18.450
She kept a few sprigs of mint
leaves in the pocket of her dress,

00:26:18.450 --> 00:26:20.460
chewed them gently, then
stored them in her cheek

00:26:20.460 --> 00:26:23.400
as a man might a small
bit of chewing tobacco.

00:26:23.400 --> 00:26:26.820
The mint kept her dehydration
from giving her bad breath

00:26:26.820 --> 00:26:30.360
and drew what moisture there was in
her body to her mouth and her lips,

00:26:30.360 --> 00:26:32.910
allowing some minimal conversation.

00:26:32.910 --> 00:26:34.810
She smiled and laughed
with the boys who danced

00:26:34.810 --> 00:26:36.680
with her and seemed happy.

00:26:36.680 --> 00:26:40.140
In the pale quivering candlelight
their faces seemed luminous,

00:26:40.140 --> 00:26:44.320 position:56%
their voices melodic, just a bit out
of sync with the modest movements

00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:46.640
of their lips and speech.

00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:50.410 position:56%
She was hardly even conscious of
how the other girls were now jealous

00:26:50.410 --> 00:26:52.900
and certainly couldn't
be bothered to care.

00:26:52.900 --> 00:26:55.070
It flickered in and
out of her awareness,

00:26:55.070 --> 00:26:58.780
a coruscation of whispers
and glares.

00:26:58.780 --> 00:27:02.080
When she danced with
Elijah Key she was happiest.

00:27:02.080 --> 00:27:05.630
He would speak to her softly,
leaning close to her ear,

00:27:05.630 --> 00:27:08.910
"How did you decide to
start coming out like this?

00:27:08.910 --> 00:27:13.010
You're so pretty, but you
seem a little strange."

00:27:13.010 --> 00:27:14.310
[ Laughter ]

00:27:14.310 --> 00:27:17.350
"I am strange," she said.

00:27:17.350 --> 00:27:22.350
So she delighted -- allowed herself
to be delighted in this attention,

00:27:22.350 --> 00:27:26.010
in the public intimacy with
Elijah Key, in her flirtation

00:27:26.010 --> 00:27:30.830
with other boys, in the flaunting
of herself before the other girls.

00:27:30.830 --> 00:27:34.510
Even though she knew this was
something with no long life ahead

00:27:34.510 --> 00:27:37.820
of it, she was able to press
into the moments of pleasure

00:27:37.820 --> 00:27:40.690
in the movements of her own body.

00:27:40.690 --> 00:27:44.140
She understood somehow that she
was lucky in her special way

00:27:44.140 --> 00:27:48.250
to love these events without the
complicated, pressing question

00:27:48.250 --> 00:27:54.040
of physical love, to absorb life
from the center and its periphery

00:27:54.040 --> 00:27:57.170
at once, so she could
for a while take it all

00:27:57.170 --> 00:28:00.850
in with the sweet fullness
of the entirely human

00:28:00.850 --> 00:28:04.870
and the utterly strange
without apprehension of fear.

00:28:04.870 --> 00:28:08.510
That was --

00:28:08.510 --> 00:28:15.200
[ Applause ]

00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:16.500
Thank you, thank you.

00:28:16.500 --> 00:28:18.140
&gt;&gt; Bill Roorbach: I love how she
holds herself a little separate,

00:28:18.140 --> 00:28:20.650
like the slip of paper
always blowing away

00:28:20.650 --> 00:28:21.950
that you're trying to grab.

00:28:21.950 --> 00:28:23.250
Beautiful.

00:28:23.250 --> 00:28:24.550
&gt;&gt; Brad Watson: Yeah, I
loved writing that scene.

00:28:24.550 --> 00:28:26.140
You know, once I got to it,
I really loved writing it.

00:28:26.140 --> 00:28:28.520
I love the idea of
her figuring out how

00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:31.610
to make herself a little bit
stoned, you know, on the --

00:28:31.610 --> 00:28:33.700
&gt;&gt; Bill Roorbach: From
the privations.

00:28:33.700 --> 00:28:35.000
&gt;&gt; Brad Watson: By deprivation

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:37.290
and that making her
more attractive, yeah.

00:28:37.290 --> 00:28:40.650
So I really enjoyed it, writing it.

00:28:40.650 --> 00:28:46.640
So Bill, this is one of the
best collections of stories

00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:48.440
that I own and have read.

00:28:48.440 --> 00:28:49.740
&gt;&gt; Bill Roorbach: Thanks.

00:28:49.740 --> 00:28:51.160
&gt;&gt; Brad Watson: I mean,
these are beautiful.

00:28:51.160 --> 00:28:53.940
These are beautiful -- they
are all beautiful stories.

00:28:53.940 --> 00:29:02.420
And, you know, there's a grouchy
guy online who writes a blog

00:29:02.420 --> 00:29:04.880
about short story, and
he gets really ticked off

00:29:04.880 --> 00:29:07.410
when anyone says that, "This
story is like a novel."

00:29:07.410 --> 00:29:08.710
&gt;&gt; Bill Roorbach: Yeah [Laughs].

00:29:08.710 --> 00:29:10.010
&gt;&gt; Brad Watson: Because he's
a fan of the short story

00:29:10.010 --> 00:29:11.660
and not the novel, you know?

00:29:11.660 --> 00:29:15.790
But there really is -- you
do build worlds, you know,

00:29:15.790 --> 00:29:18.130 position:56%
in these stories in a wonderful way.

00:29:18.130 --> 00:29:23.250
And no -- I mean, and
in such different ways.

00:29:23.250 --> 00:29:30.780
The opening story, Harbinger Hall,
is about a boy decides not just

00:29:30.780 --> 00:29:33.320
to play hooky, but he
thinks he's going to be able

00:29:33.320 --> 00:29:39.830
to pull off somehow
playing hooky forever.

00:29:39.830 --> 00:29:41.130
&gt;&gt; Bill Roorbach: Yeah [Laughs].

00:29:41.130 --> 00:29:42.550 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Brad Watson: Thinks he's going to
be clever enough to pull that off,

00:29:42.550 --> 00:29:45.440
you know, that no one will notice.

00:29:45.440 --> 00:29:50.190
And then he comes across this
mansion and he spies on it,

00:29:50.190 --> 00:29:54.930
and then he kind of gets caught by
almost kind of like a giant, right?

00:29:54.930 --> 00:29:58.300
And then he's taken aside
and there's this old man.

00:29:58.300 --> 00:30:01.650
And then the story becomes the
old man telling him the story

00:30:01.650 --> 00:30:08.080
of the Russian Revolution -- or an
episode in the Russian Revolution.

00:30:08.080 --> 00:30:11.490
And we come to realize that
he's telling his own story.

00:30:11.490 --> 00:30:16.000
So the boy -- and how did you
come to decide to tell that story

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:18.640
in that particular fashion,
the story within the story?

00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:20.370
I mean, it's just done
so beautifully.

00:30:20.370 --> 00:30:23.790
And I love it when someone
can do it, you know?

00:30:23.790 --> 00:30:25.270
And you manage to have someone --

00:30:25.270 --> 00:30:28.660
also love stories where
a character gets to talk.

00:30:28.660 --> 00:30:29.960
&gt;&gt; Bill Roorbach: Yeah.

00:30:29.960 --> 00:30:31.260
&gt;&gt; Brad Watson: You know?

00:30:31.260 --> 00:30:32.960
Gets to have long periods
of speaking

00:30:32.960 --> 00:30:35.210
and it's perfectly
natural within the story.

00:30:35.210 --> 00:30:37.570
It doesn't seem imposed or
awkward or anything like that.

00:30:37.570 --> 00:30:38.870
&gt;&gt; Bill Roorbach: Oh, thanks.

00:30:38.870 --> 00:30:40.170
&gt;&gt; Brad Watson: You
set that up perfectly.

00:30:40.170 --> 00:30:42.640
That's one of my favorite
stories in the book, really.

00:30:42.640 --> 00:30:44.360
&gt;&gt; Bill Roorbach: Well, just
growing up I was like --

00:30:44.360 --> 00:30:49.640 position:56%
I grew up in Connecticut -- and, you
know, at that time it was woodsy,

00:30:49.640 --> 00:30:51.380
there were still some farms,

00:30:51.380 --> 00:30:53.370
but there were also --
it's ex-urban New York.

00:30:53.370 --> 00:30:55.550
So there's some lots of big estates

00:30:55.550 --> 00:31:00.320
with big stone mansions
and that kind of thing.

00:31:00.320 --> 00:31:04.090
And I had a secret scheme
to get out of school,

00:31:04.090 --> 00:31:05.880
which a couple of us
figured this out.

00:31:05.880 --> 00:31:10.080 position:56%
You would just -- because one of our
friends moved and he brought a note

00:31:10.080 --> 00:31:14.030
from his mother that said,
"We're moving as of April 3rd."

00:31:14.030 --> 00:31:16.040
[ Laughter ]

00:31:16.040 --> 00:31:18.600
And the kid gave it to the teacher,
the teacher said, "Oh my goodness.

00:31:18.600 --> 00:31:21.200
Well, we'll have a
party and say goodbye."

00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:22.540
And so off he went.

00:31:22.540 --> 00:31:25.010
And I thought, you know,
anyone could do that.

00:31:25.010 --> 00:31:26.670
[ Laughter ]

00:31:26.670 --> 00:31:29.630
So I never did it,
but I never forgot

00:31:29.630 --> 00:31:32.210
that great scam that I -- you know?

00:31:32.210 --> 00:31:36.600
And I just dreamed that I would go
off in the woods every day instead

00:31:36.600 --> 00:31:42.030
of going to school, you know,
which is also how I operated

00:31:42.030 --> 00:31:46.070
as a college professor for so long.

00:31:46.070 --> 00:31:50.240
But through the woods, through our
woods you had to walk for, like,

00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:52.220
a mile but you came to
an old carriage house.

00:31:52.220 --> 00:31:57.010
And you knew you were on the such
and such estate, the Erwin estate.

00:31:57.010 --> 00:32:01.280 position:56%
And then up the hill was this giant
mansion, and we'd sneak around there

00:32:01.280 --> 00:32:03.520
and play war games and
look in the windows.

00:32:03.520 --> 00:32:05.100
And we never got caught.

00:32:05.100 --> 00:32:07.720
But for the story I just
thought, "What if they got caught?

00:32:07.720 --> 00:32:09.020
What if a kid got caught?"

00:32:09.020 --> 00:32:11.720
So he does skip school,
he does get caught.

00:32:11.720 --> 00:32:15.680
And the old guy isn't a threatening
guy but someone who takes him

00:32:15.680 --> 00:32:21.040
under his wing and has
finally found his audience

00:32:21.040 --> 00:32:25.960
for his really horrible story
of the destruction of his life

00:32:25.960 --> 00:32:30.440
in Russia during the
Russian Revolution.

00:32:30.440 --> 00:32:37.540
So the story takes place in 1963
and the old story takes place 1905.

00:32:37.540 --> 00:32:39.660
So that's where that came from.

00:32:39.660 --> 00:32:42.220
&gt;&gt; Brad Watson: There's so
many beautiful moments, though,

00:32:42.220 --> 00:32:45.700
when the count -- the
way that the old count,

00:32:45.700 --> 00:32:47.130
we don't know he's
the old count now,

00:32:47.130 --> 00:32:50.350
we think he's under
his assumed name --

00:32:50.350 --> 00:32:55.760
but the way he tells the
story in third person.

00:32:55.760 --> 00:32:59.010
And when you begin to become aware
that he's speaking of himself

00:32:59.010 --> 00:33:03.400
and his wife and his children
dying in this way or that way.

00:33:03.400 --> 00:33:04.700
&gt;&gt; Bill Roorbach: Yeah.

00:33:04.700 --> 00:33:07.430 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Brad Watson: And then the boy,
and he says, "Well, what shall we do

00:33:07.430 --> 00:33:09.540
with these poor souls
who are departed?

00:33:09.540 --> 00:33:10.870
Let us take them to Sweden."

00:33:10.870 --> 00:33:13.040
I don't know, is that the
boy's idea or is that the --

00:33:13.040 --> 00:33:14.340
&gt;&gt; Bill Roorbach: Oh, yeah.

00:33:14.340 --> 00:33:15.640
The old guy's got a box of --

00:33:15.640 --> 00:33:16.940
&gt;&gt; Brad Watson: He had a big map.

00:33:16.940 --> 00:33:18.240
He's got a gigantic map of Europe.

00:33:18.240 --> 00:33:20.390
&gt;&gt; Bill Roorbach: And he's
got little characters in a box

00:33:20.390 --> 00:33:23.030
that are all the people
from his life that are dead,

00:33:23.030 --> 00:33:27.500
including all of his children, all
of his mother's father's uncles,

00:33:27.500 --> 00:33:31.520
aunts, all of his sisters
and brothers.

00:33:31.520 --> 00:33:32.820
Everyone's --

00:33:32.820 --> 00:33:34.120
&gt;&gt; Brad Watson: His father.

00:33:34.120 --> 00:33:35.420
&gt;&gt; Bill Roorbach: Everyone's dead,

00:33:35.420 --> 00:33:36.720
but he has these little
models of them.

00:33:36.720 --> 00:33:39.290
And the little boy picks out
people as he tells a story

00:33:39.290 --> 00:33:41.270 position:56%
and flies them off to the graveyard.

00:33:41.270 --> 00:33:43.770
&gt;&gt; Brad Watson: He said,
"Let us fly them to Sweden."

00:33:43.770 --> 00:33:45.080
&gt;&gt; Bill Roorbach: Let's
fly them to Sweden.

00:33:45.080 --> 00:33:46.510
&gt;&gt; Brad Watson: He
takes them to Sweden.

00:33:46.510 --> 00:33:47.810
And there's all over there.

00:33:47.810 --> 00:33:50.120
And I love the moment
when he says, "Well,

00:33:50.120 --> 00:33:56.100
now there's the old count also
who dies early in the skirmish.

00:33:56.100 --> 00:33:58.820
Who shall we choose,
which figurine?"

00:33:58.820 --> 00:34:05.330
And the boy picks one
out, "Excellent choice."

00:34:05.330 --> 00:34:09.360
And you know that's the
father is the right count.

00:34:09.360 --> 00:34:10.660
It's a beautiful story.

00:34:10.660 --> 00:34:13.520
It has moments like that through,
I mean, all of these stories.

00:34:13.520 --> 00:34:14.820
&gt;&gt; Bill Roorbach: Yeah.

00:34:14.820 --> 00:34:16.120
I'm not trying to make condensed
novels because they do feel

00:34:16.120 --> 00:34:20.000
like a different impulse
from a novel.

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:23.490
Like, I always know when I'm
in a story versus a novel.

00:34:23.490 --> 00:34:25.950
And I know what material's
going to be good

00:34:25.950 --> 00:34:29.230
for a story as opposed to novel.

00:34:29.230 --> 00:34:31.600
But yeah. There's some
way I built --

00:34:31.600 --> 00:34:34.550
someone said that and I
was like, "Oh yeah, okay.

00:34:34.550 --> 00:34:35.850
That makes sense."

00:34:35.850 --> 00:34:37.150
&gt;&gt; Brad Watson: Yeah.

00:34:37.150 --> 00:34:39.280
That always reminds me of that
Lars Gustafsson story, you know,

00:34:39.280 --> 00:34:43.260
he has this beautiful story
Greatness Strikes Where It Pleases.

00:34:43.260 --> 00:34:46.120
And most people found out
because Charles Baxter put it in,

00:34:46.120 --> 00:34:47.420
"You got to read this."

00:34:47.420 --> 00:34:48.720
Yeah, you know?

00:34:48.720 --> 00:34:53.720 position:56%
And so my wife actually studied with
Lars at Texas for a while and said

00:34:53.720 --> 00:34:57.730
to him one time, "Yeah, Lars,
how did you write that story?"

00:34:57.730 --> 00:35:01.010 position:56%
And he said, "Yes, how did I do it?"

00:35:01.010 --> 00:35:02.600
[ Laughter ]

00:35:02.600 --> 00:35:04.000
That's all he could say.

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:05.690
&gt;&gt; Bill Roorbach: Well,
part of it is magic, right?

00:35:05.690 --> 00:35:06.990
Part of it is --

00:35:06.990 --> 00:35:08.290
&gt;&gt; Brad Watson: Right.

00:35:08.290 --> 00:35:09.590
&gt;&gt; Bill Roorbach: -- it's you're
really dreaming your way into it.

00:35:09.590 --> 00:35:13.120
I always say that writing is the
slowest form of reading, you know?

00:35:13.120 --> 00:35:15.220
[ Laughter ]

00:35:15.220 --> 00:35:18.930
It's just I want to find out
what's going to happen, too.

00:35:18.930 --> 00:35:21.160
Even if I know what's
going to happen at the end,

00:35:21.160 --> 00:35:23.700
how it gets there,
that's interesting, too.

00:35:23.700 --> 00:35:26.680
That's a different kind
of suspense, you know, so.

00:35:26.680 --> 00:35:27.980
&gt;&gt; Brad Watson: I know.

00:35:27.980 --> 00:35:29.280
Well, I was talking earlier to you

00:35:29.280 --> 00:35:31.440
about how I love the way
you pace the title story,

00:35:31.440 --> 00:35:36.430
which is the last story in the
collection <i>The Girl of the Lake</i>.

00:35:36.430 --> 00:35:38.220
I mean, one time that Kathy read it

00:35:38.220 --> 00:35:39.900
and thought maybe it was
moving a little slowly,

00:35:39.900 --> 00:35:41.200
but I didn't think so.

00:35:41.200 --> 00:35:43.370
I thought the pacing
was just wonderfully --

00:35:43.370 --> 00:35:46.190
it had a revolution, you know?

00:35:46.190 --> 00:35:51.690
It's kind of like there was an RPM
to the story that felt right to it.

00:35:51.690 --> 00:35:54.310
And I just -- I rolled
with it and rolled with it.

00:35:54.310 --> 00:35:57.550
And I was never impatient for
the next moment, you know,

00:35:57.550 --> 00:35:59.630
even though they are full
of tension when [inaudible].

00:35:59.630 --> 00:36:00.930
&gt;&gt; Bill Roorbach: Because
some of the stories are

00:36:00.930 --> 00:36:02.230
like bang, bang, bang, bang, bang.

00:36:02.230 --> 00:36:04.770
And that one is just
let it unfold, right?

00:36:04.770 --> 00:36:06.070
&gt;&gt; Brad Watson: Yeah.

00:36:06.070 --> 00:36:07.370
&gt;&gt; Bill Roorbach: Yeah.

00:36:07.370 --> 00:36:08.670
&gt;&gt; Brad Watson: It's a good way --

00:36:08.670 --> 00:36:09.970
I thought also a good
story to end the book,

00:36:09.970 --> 00:36:13.580
even though it's traditional sort
of to do the title story last,

00:36:13.580 --> 00:36:15.940
it's a good choice in itself.

00:36:15.940 --> 00:36:18.600
&gt;&gt; Bill Roorbach: Yeah, as
Brad said, my editor was like,

00:36:18.600 --> 00:36:21.040
"Maybe you can tighten it up.

00:36:21.040 --> 00:36:22.340
It's a little slow."

00:36:22.340 --> 00:36:26.270
And I thought, "No, let's
let it be slow," I mean --

and she's like, "Well,
people's patience has changed.

"Well, let's slow them down."

00:36:34.540 --> 00:36:36.570

better read something.

00:36:45.710 --> 00:36:47.810

just read a page.

00:36:47.810 --> 00:36:49.110

00:36:50.410 --> 00:36:51.710
You're beautiful.

00:36:51.710 --> 00:36:53.010
You're a beautiful man.

00:36:53.010 --> 00:36:54.310
[ Laughter ]

00:36:54.310 --> 00:36:55.610
At breakfast on one of those --

00:36:55.610 --> 00:36:58.980
this is from the title
story The Girl of the Lake.

00:36:58.980 --> 00:37:02.750
And this young man's at the
family cabin with his grandmother,

00:37:02.750 --> 00:37:06.560 position:56%
only two of them this summer -- at
breakfast on one of the perfect days

00:37:06.560 --> 00:37:10.490
of mid-August, still
no notion in the wind

00:37:10.490 --> 00:37:12.460
that the season might ever end,

00:37:12.460 --> 00:37:16.100
grandma asked Chick
if we wanted E-Cough.

00:37:16.100 --> 00:37:17.600
Chick laughed, "E-Cough?"

00:37:17.600 --> 00:37:20.500
he said. "E-Cough," said Grandma."

00:37:20.500 --> 00:37:23.040
"I don't drink E-Cough, Grandma."

00:37:23.040 --> 00:37:25.350
She grinned sheepishly, charmingly,

00:37:25.350 --> 00:37:27.860
laughed at herself,
and that had been that.

00:37:27.860 --> 00:37:30.420
At lunch she said,
"Look at me, Charles."

00:37:30.420 --> 00:37:32.340
And Chick looked a long while.

00:37:32.340 --> 00:37:35.950
She looked so beautiful, so
square and strong and happy.

00:37:35.950 --> 00:37:37.510
After dinner, which was one

00:37:37.510 --> 00:37:41.290
of Mr. Parmenter's chickens
roasted perfectly, tiny potatoes,

00:37:41.290 --> 00:37:45.320 position:56%
string beans with almonds, chocolate
cake, a delicate discussion

00:37:45.320 --> 00:37:48.860
about her favorite music
versus Chick's Italian opera --

00:37:48.860 --> 00:37:51.850
not so different from
Miles Davis, they decided,

00:37:51.850 --> 00:37:54.260 position:56%
at least in its effects on the soul.

00:37:54.260 --> 00:37:56.670
She said she had a
drumming headache.

00:37:56.670 --> 00:37:59.390
The next morning she stood
vacantly in the kitchen,

00:37:59.390 --> 00:38:03.010
simply stared at Chick, a
block of raw bacon in her hand.

00:38:03.010 --> 00:38:04.310
"Grandma?"

00:38:04.310 --> 00:38:06.940
She grinned sheepishly,
said nothing.

00:38:06.940 --> 00:38:08.240
"Grandma?"

00:38:08.240 --> 00:38:10.690
Chick accepted the bacon
from her, put it back on ice,

00:38:10.690 --> 00:38:12.200
gathered her up in his arms --

00:38:12.200 --> 00:38:14.810
surprisingly heavy for
such a little bird --

00:38:14.810 --> 00:38:17.780
enveloped her and heaved
her up the walk to the Jeep,

00:38:17.780 --> 00:38:21.440
sat her in the passenger seat
where she retained her posture.

00:38:21.440 --> 00:38:23.240
One time his sister
had gotten stitches

00:38:23.240 --> 00:38:27.210
from a doctor somewhere near,
but he had no idea where or who.

00:38:27.210 --> 00:38:29.060
Of course, there was no phone.

00:38:29.060 --> 00:38:32.210
He drove carefully up the
hump driveway to Race Road,

00:38:32.210 --> 00:38:36.140
pulled out over the potholes at
the proper speed to beat them,

00:38:36.140 --> 00:38:39.440
drove stiffly 12 miles
to Beamis Corners --

00:38:39.440 --> 00:38:42.170
25 long minutes without
conversation.

00:38:42.170 --> 00:38:45.670
At the gas station, he pulled
in and honked loud and long.

00:38:45.670 --> 00:38:48.300
Mina flounced out,
annoyed at the honking

00:38:48.300 --> 00:38:50.390
until she saw Chick and blushed.

00:38:50.390 --> 00:38:53.120
He asked politely where
he might find a hospital.

00:38:53.120 --> 00:38:55.530
She looked at him closely,
then at grandma.

00:38:55.530 --> 00:38:58.550
"Oh my," she said, "The
hospital's in Keene [phonetic].

00:38:58.550 --> 00:38:59.850
It's 20 miles.

00:38:59.850 --> 00:39:01.460
Mrs. Flexheart?

00:39:01.460 --> 00:39:02.760
Is there a doctor?"

00:39:02.760 --> 00:39:04.280
"In Keene," I said.

00:39:04.280 --> 00:39:05.580
Chick began to panic.

00:39:05.580 --> 00:39:07.260
He said, "How do I find it?"

00:39:07.260 --> 00:39:08.950
"Oh dear," Philomena said.

00:39:08.950 --> 00:39:11.990
She patted his arms,
eyes sparkling with care.

00:39:11.990 --> 00:39:14.220
In a rush she said,
"I'll go with you."

00:39:14.220 --> 00:39:16.570
She called to her father,
who hurried from the garage

00:39:16.570 --> 00:39:18.840
at her tone, wrenches in hand.

00:39:18.840 --> 00:39:21.830
The girl quickly explained
Mrs. Flexheart was ill.

00:39:21.830 --> 00:39:25.580
Her father was as urgent as
she, tears starting to his eyes.

00:39:25.580 --> 00:39:27.030
Everyone loved grandma.

00:39:27.030 --> 00:39:30.420
Philomena climbed in the back
seat and gave directions.

00:39:30.420 --> 00:39:34.580
Chick had never driven on a highway
but found it easy once he got used

00:39:34.580 --> 00:39:38.080
to all the cars passing
him, all the honking.

00:39:38.080 --> 00:39:40.590
Mina leaned forward,
held grandma's shoulders,

00:39:40.590 --> 00:39:42.070
said, "Speed up a little."

00:39:42.070 --> 00:39:44.520
But it was hard for Chick
to go over the speed limit.

00:39:44.520 --> 00:39:48.480
Mr. Parmenter had told him for
Race Road 30 miles an hour.

00:39:48.480 --> 00:39:50.220
The girl smelled of gasoline.

00:39:50.220 --> 00:39:52.880
She put a hand on Chick's
shoulder, too.

00:39:52.880 --> 00:39:56.520
Her hair was red in the mirror, her
cheeks streaked with engine grease.

00:39:56.520 --> 00:40:00.180
He used the mirror to catch her
bright green eye for reassurance.

00:40:00.180 --> 00:40:02.660
Grandma sat very still.

00:40:02.660 --> 00:40:06.120
Thinking of other disasters
and still with no preamble,

00:40:06.120 --> 00:40:10.620
Chick unburdened himself, said, "I
saw the Shaunessy girl out there."

00:40:10.620 --> 00:40:13.600
"I've seen her, too,"
Mina said matter of fact,

00:40:13.600 --> 00:40:15.020
knowing what he meant by out there.

00:40:15.020 --> 00:40:16.320
Spruce Island, of course.

00:40:16.320 --> 00:40:20.690
She said, "Anya Shaunessy, she's so
beautiful, isn't she -- wasn't she?

00:40:20.690 --> 00:40:22.830
And her dog, I was
frightened of them, though.

00:40:22.830 --> 00:40:25.350
Purely silent, that loverly dress.

00:40:25.350 --> 00:40:27.630
I dropped my bucket and
ran right for the boat.

00:40:27.630 --> 00:40:29.170
No one believed me."

00:40:29.170 --> 00:40:31.270
She tightened her grip
on his shoulder.

00:40:31.270 --> 00:40:33.920
The trip took 40 minutes,
but they made Keene,

00:40:33.920 --> 00:40:36.360
grandma's posture perfect
the whole ride.

00:40:36.360 --> 00:40:39.310
She was silent and unblinking,
but she breathed well

00:40:39.310 --> 00:40:41.090
and Chick knew she'd be okay.

00:40:41.090 --> 00:40:43.020
At the emergency room
entrance he pulled

00:40:43.020 --> 00:40:45.380 position:56%
up perfectly, set the parking brake.

00:40:45.380 --> 00:40:49.330
He and Mina went to help grandma
out, but despite the straight spine

00:40:49.330 --> 00:40:53.020
and high chin, the open
eyes, she was unmoving.

00:40:53.020 --> 00:40:55.090
Boy and girl hefted the old woman,

00:40:55.090 --> 00:40:57.240
carried her into the
emergency room lobby.

00:40:57.240 --> 00:40:59.180
Two nurses scurried to their sides

00:40:59.180 --> 00:41:01.130
as they lay their burden
on the floor.

00:41:01.130 --> 00:41:04.610
A doctor rushed in, and then a
couple of orderlies in blue scrubs

00:41:04.610 --> 00:41:07.610
who lifted grandma onto
their gurney in a calm hurry.

00:41:07.610 --> 00:41:11.590
But after a few busy minutes,
the doctor just stopped.

00:41:11.590 --> 00:41:14.500
He set his chin, looked at Chick.

00:41:14.500 --> 00:41:16.730
The orderlies relaxed.

00:41:16.730 --> 00:41:19.170 position:56%
"I'm sorry," one of the nurses said.

00:41:19.170 --> 00:41:23.280
Philomena burst into hot
tears; Chick then, too.

00:41:23.280 --> 00:41:26.540
Shocked and weeping, standing among
strangers, it was only natural

00:41:26.540 --> 00:41:29.490
that he and Mina caught one
another in a tight embrace,

00:41:29.490 --> 00:41:32.240
the nurse then folding
them both in her own arms,

00:41:32.240 --> 00:41:34.710
then an orderly joining
in, then the doctor --

00:41:34.710 --> 00:41:37.550
a long group hug, protocol
abandoned,

00:41:37.550 --> 00:41:39.180
all of them in their humanity.

00:41:39.180 --> 00:41:42.860
Mina's father arrived with
Mr. Parmenter in short order.

00:41:42.860 --> 00:41:45.430
Chick had never seen a man cry

00:41:45.430 --> 00:41:48.580
like Mr. Parmenter cried
when he heard the news.

00:41:48.580 --> 00:41:51.620
The old bird dropped to
his knees, held his face,

00:41:51.620 --> 00:41:53.930
sobbed and gulped inconsolably,

00:41:53.930 --> 00:41:57.610
so devastated that even an hour
later he couldn't drive the Jeep

00:41:57.610 --> 00:42:00.950

Mr. Hardy, Mina and Chick

00:42:00.950 --> 00:42:04.300

the mechanic's ancient Woody,

00:42:04.300 --> 00:42:08.190
her foot hooked stealthily
around Chick's calf,

00:42:08.190 --> 00:42:10.350
their fingers tightly interlaced,

00:42:10.350 --> 00:42:13.600
sweaty after a while,
almost painful, too.

00:42:13.600 --> 00:42:14.900
It didn't matter.

00:42:14.900 --> 00:42:17.010

story's not the only story

00:42:32.550 --> 00:42:35.370

is so that people will have

Shaunessy girl is a ghost.

and you're really committed --

00:42:59.400 --> 00:43:01.460
but a ghost in, you're
really committed.

00:43:01.460 --> 00:43:04.640
But in a story you put a
ghost in and you only have

00:43:04.640 --> 00:43:08.170
to justify it for 20 or 30 pages.

00:43:08.170 --> 00:43:10.330
[ Laughter ]

00:43:10.330 --> 00:43:12.760
But it was fun to make
stories for the same reason.

00:43:12.760 --> 00:43:15.900
Because a novel, again, is
such a years' long commitment.

00:43:15.900 --> 00:43:17.200
And the stories I make,

00:43:17.200 --> 00:43:21.390
it's interstitial among
everything else I'm working on.

00:43:21.390 --> 00:43:23.540
So I write books and
then I write a story.

00:43:23.540 --> 00:43:26.580
So these stories are
written over ten years

00:43:26.580 --> 00:43:28.870
and then revisited to make a book.

00:43:28.870 --> 00:43:31.300
They've all been published
various places,

00:43:31.300 --> 00:43:33.780

And being a new writer, you
know, you change every year.

00:43:37.190 --> 00:43:39.900
I brought new things to
every story, you know?

00:43:39.900 --> 00:43:43.350
I tinkered with the endings, and in
some cases I really changed them.

00:44:47.210 --> 00:44:51.920
So I can just turn to him and say,
"That book is fucking great, Brad."

00:44:51.920 --> 00:44:53.500
&gt;&gt; Brad Watson: So is your
book, it's fucking great.

00:44:53.500 --> 00:44:54.800
&gt;&gt; Bill Roorbach: There we go.

00:44:54.800 --> 00:44:56.100
We love each other.

Thank you very much.

the Library of Congress, too.

00:45:03.300 --> 00:45:05.390
&gt;&gt; Brad Watson: And one
last thing, I just --

00:45:05.390 --> 00:45:07.560
you know sometimes you
feel like you got to rest

00:45:07.560 --> 00:45:09.190
between stories or pause, you know?

00:45:09.190 --> 00:45:11.830
It's really hard to
do that with this one.

00:45:11.830 --> 00:45:13.130 position:56%
You just want to read another, Bill.

00:45:14.430 --> 00:45:15.730
You're really great.

00:45:15.730 --> 00:45:17.090
We're going to sell some of
them downstairs, I guess.

00:45:17.090 --> 00:45:19.270
So -- I don't know.

00:45:19.270 --> 00:45:20.790
Come and say hi.

00:45:20.790 --> 00:45:24.320
We'll be down there to talk, too.

00:45:24.320 --> 00:45:25.960
&gt;&gt; Brad Watson: Yeah.

00:45:25.960 --> 00:45:29.620
