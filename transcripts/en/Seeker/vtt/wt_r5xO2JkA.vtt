00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.620
Yellowstone National Park is one of the must-see
locations in the U.S., but underneath it is

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:10.100
one of about 20 supervolcanoes around the
world and it could erupt at any time.

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:12.040
Ahhh nature.

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:17.000
A supervolcano is one that ejects more than
1,000 cubic kilometers of pumice and ash in

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.039
a single eruption.

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:22.770
The result of a super-eruption would be soot
in the atmosphere blocking sunlight and cooling

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:27.099
the planet for years, changing the global
climate enough to kill a significant number

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:28.130
of species.

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:29.690
(Possibly including us…)

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:34.310
This, is scarier than a comet or asteroid
impact because we can’t send Bruce Willis

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:35.310
to blow it up.

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:36.750
It’s right in our backyard.

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.310
So, naturally NASA has come up with a way
to delay that devastating event and generate

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:43.280
clean energy in the process.

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:48.350
Seismologists believe the supervolcano under
Yellowstone erupts once every 600,000 or so

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:49.350
years.

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.840
The odds we’ll see it are low, but we’re
coming up on that thermal breaking point where

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:54.900
it will blow… eventually.

00:00:54.900 --> 00:01:00.310
NASA’s plan is to cool the magma chambers
inside the supervolcano so it doesn’t.

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:04.600
Most of Yellowstone’s heat — between 60
and 70 percent — is lost through leaking,

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.260
via hot springs.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:10.900
Experts say that cutting 35-percent of the
remaining heat could stop this super-volcano

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:12.220
from erupting!

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:16.980
Volcanic heat is already used by people in
Iceland to heat and power their homes.

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:21.990
We do everything bigger in America… so let’s
tap into the biggest volcano that we have!

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:27.470
NASA’s plan is to drill as far as 10 kilometres
down inside the Yellowstone Caldera and pump

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:30.150
in high-pressure water to absorb the heat.

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.090
Coming out of the volcano, that scorching
water would be used to power a geothermal

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:35.240
energy plant.

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:36.840
There are a couple ways to do this…

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.720
The super hot water could be brought to a
cooling tank, and as it cools, it would turn

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:43.670
into water vapour, a process called flash
vaporization.

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:48.350
16c.That vapor could then drive a turbine
that powers a generator, providing energy.

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:53.260
Another option is a binary cycle power plant
that uses something called a heat transfer

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:54.260
fluid.

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:58.750
The fluid turns into vapor as the superheated
water passes through a heat transfer tank.

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:03.100
But, again, it’s the vapor that powers the
turbine to power the generator.

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:07.300
In either case, there are lots of benefits
to geothermal power, which could provide energy

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:10.350
to the surrounding area for as much as 10,000
years!

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:14.890
It’s clean, available around the clock,
has low emissions, and a small footprint,

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:17.610
and because of that, a minimal environmental
impact.

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.950
The problem with this crazy planet-saving,
energy-yielding NASA plan is that: it’s

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:22.950
not perfect.

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:28.630
A misplaced drill could trigger a supereruption,
and the 3.46 billion dollar price tag is pretty

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:30.090
much a non-starter.

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.430
But the eruption will happen if we don’t
do something.

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:33.500
It’s inevitable.

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.690
And though 3.46 billion dollars sounds like
a lot -- the U.S.

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:39.319
Government spends that about every eight hours.

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:43.440
And this might be worth saving the planet,
and if nothing else when NASA releases the

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.610
details, this could get researchers thinking
about other solutions to this bubbling time

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:48.620
bomb.

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:50.800
Yellowstone National Park is amazing.

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:54.020
And if you visit, you might want to make a
website of pictures to share.

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:56.850
Which means you need a domain from Domain
dot com.

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:00.840
When you buy a domain name from Domain Dot
Com, you’re taking the first steps in creating

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.260
an identity and vision for your brand.

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:07.890
No domain extension will help tell your story
like a DOT COM or DOT NET domain name.

This solution might sound crazy, but it really
isn’t.

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:21.620
We looked at a plan to capture and store carbon
dioxide in the oceans in this episode right

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:22.620
here.

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:24.060
Which plan do you guys think is more exciting?
