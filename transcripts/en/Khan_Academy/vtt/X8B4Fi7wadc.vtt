00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.239
- [Voiceover] We're asked to describe

00:00:01.239 --> 00:00:03.134
the behavior of the function q around

00:00:03.134 --> 00:00:06.083
its vertical asymptote at x = -3,

00:00:06.083 --> 00:00:07.712
and like always, if
you're familiar with this,

00:00:07.712 --> 00:00:09.113
I encourage you to pause it and see if you

00:00:09.113 --> 00:00:10.725
can get some practice, and if you're not,

00:00:10.725 --> 00:00:12.499
well, I'm about to do it with you.

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:14.572
All right, so this is q of x, it's defined

00:00:14.572 --> 00:00:16.105
by a rational expression,
and whenever I'm dealing

00:00:16.105 --> 00:00:18.621
with asymptotes, I like
to factor the numerators

00:00:18.621 --> 00:00:21.092
and the denominators so I can
make more sense of things.

00:00:21.092 --> 00:00:24.068
So the numerator here, what
two numbers if I were...

00:00:24.068 --> 00:00:26.151
Their product is two
and their sum is three,

00:00:26.151 --> 00:00:28.238
well that's two and one,
so I can factor this

00:00:28.238 --> 00:00:32.862
as x + 1 times x + 2, if
that's unfamiliar to you,

00:00:32.862 --> 00:00:34.606
I recommend you watch the videos

00:00:34.606 --> 00:00:37.355
on Khan Academy about
factoring quadratics,

00:00:37.355 --> 00:00:42.343
and over x + 3, and when

00:00:42.343 --> 00:00:46.257
x = -1, or x = -2, it would
make the numerator equal zero

00:00:46.257 --> 00:00:48.246
without making the denominator equal zero,

00:00:48.246 --> 00:00:49.518
so those are points where the function

00:00:49.518 --> 00:00:52.325
is equal to zero, but when x = -3,

00:00:52.325 --> 00:00:55.121
the denominator equals
zero, while the numerator

00:00:55.121 --> 00:00:57.480
is not equal to zero, so
we're dividing by zero,

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.474
and so that's a pretty good
sign of a vertical asymptote,

00:01:01.474 --> 00:01:03.063
that our function as
we approach that value

00:01:03.063 --> 00:01:05.042
is either going to pop up like that,

00:01:05.042 --> 00:01:07.398
or it's going to pop down, or it's going

00:01:07.398 --> 00:01:10.572
to pop down like that, or maybe,

00:01:10.572 --> 00:01:13.585
or either way, or could pop up like that,

00:01:13.585 --> 00:01:15.466
or it could go down something like that,

00:01:15.466 --> 00:01:17.119
but we're going to have
a vertical asymptote

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:19.745
that the function as you approach x = -3,

00:01:19.745 --> 00:01:21.495
that the function is going to approach

00:01:21.495 --> 00:01:23.962
either positive infinity
or negative infinity

00:01:23.962 --> 00:01:25.572
or it might do positive infinity

00:01:25.572 --> 00:01:26.943
from one direction or negative infinity

00:01:26.943 --> 00:01:29.225
from another direction and if this idea

00:01:29.225 --> 00:01:30.933
of directionality is a
little bit confusing,

00:01:30.933 --> 00:01:32.940
well that's where we're,
that's what we're about

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:34.455
to address in this video.

00:01:34.455 --> 00:01:37.484
Let me just draw a number line here

00:01:37.484 --> 00:01:41.341
that focuses on these interesting values.

00:01:41.341 --> 00:01:45.416
So we care about x = -3, and then

00:01:45.416 --> 00:01:48.882
the other interesting values may be -2,

00:01:48.882 --> 00:01:52.876
- 1, it's all there, now what does it mean

00:01:52.876 --> 00:01:55.978
to be approaching x, what does it mean

00:01:55.978 --> 00:01:59.741
for x to be approaching -3
from the negative direction?

00:01:59.741 --> 00:02:00.920
And just to be clear, this little

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.267
superscript right over here,

00:02:02.267 --> 00:02:06.257
that means we're approaching
from the negative direction.

00:02:06.257 --> 00:02:07.881
So that means we're
approaching from values

00:02:07.881 --> 00:02:10.171
more negative than -3, so those

00:02:10.171 --> 00:02:12.667
are these values right over here.

00:02:12.667 --> 00:02:16.511
We are approaching, we are
approaching from that direction.

00:02:16.511 --> 00:02:18.685
Another way to think
about it is we approach

00:02:18.685 --> 00:02:20.925
from the negative direction
where on the interval

00:02:20.925 --> 00:02:24.279
x is less than -3, so let's think about

00:02:24.279 --> 00:02:27.847
what the sign of q of x is going

00:02:27.847 --> 00:02:31.186
to be as we're approaching -3 from that

00:02:31.186 --> 00:02:34.977
negative direction, from the left.

00:02:34.977 --> 00:02:38.430
Well, if we have something less than -3,

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.930
and you add one, this
is going to be negative.

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:43.413
If you have something less than -3,

00:02:43.413 --> 00:02:45.779
and you add two, that's
going to be negative as well,

00:02:45.779 --> 00:02:47.318
and if you have something less than -3,

00:02:47.318 --> 00:02:50.016
and you add three, well that's
going to be negative as well.

00:02:50.016 --> 00:02:51.692
So a negative times a
negative is a positive,

00:02:51.692 --> 00:02:53.288
but then you divide by
a negative, it's going

00:02:53.288 --> 00:02:55.670
to be a negative, so q of x is going

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:57.916
to be negative on that interval.

00:02:57.916 --> 00:03:00.136
So as we approach, we have
our vertical asymptote.

00:03:00.136 --> 00:03:03.274
As we approach -3 from the left hand side,

00:03:03.274 --> 00:03:04.691
well q of x is going to be negative

00:03:04.691 --> 00:03:07.506
and so it's going to
approach negative infinity.

00:03:07.506 --> 00:03:11.520
So as x approaches -3 from
the negative direction,

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:14.267
q of x is going to
approach negative infinity.

00:03:14.267 --> 00:03:19.245
So at least this accurate,
this is accurate,

00:03:19.245 --> 00:03:23.401
and this is accurate right over here,

00:03:23.401 --> 00:03:25.730
and you can validate
that, try some values out.

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:29.191
Try negative, let's see, if you did

00:03:29.191 --> 00:03:31.180
negative three point...

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:36.180
q of negative three point,

00:03:37.275 --> 00:03:40.890
- 3.1, once again,
that's on the left side,

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:42.898
it might be like right over there.

00:03:42.898 --> 00:03:44.534
Actually, it'd probably
be a little bit further.

00:03:44.534 --> 00:03:45.844
It might be something like this,

00:03:45.844 --> 00:03:48.351
like the scale that I've drawn it on.

00:03:48.351 --> 00:03:50.968
q of -3.1, if you wanted to verify it,

00:03:50.968 --> 00:03:55.889
it's going to be -3.1 + 1, which is -2.1,

00:03:55.889 --> 00:04:00.889
times -3.1 + 2, which is negative,

00:04:01.316 --> 00:04:05.028
- 1.1, 1.1, I could
put that in parentheses

00:04:05.028 --> 00:04:07.089
just to make it clear, and then all

00:04:07.089 --> 00:04:08.850
of that is going to be over,

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:12.800
well -3.1 + 3 is going to be,

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:17.416
is going to be -0.1.

00:04:17.416 --> 00:04:20.485
So notice whatever we get up
here that's a positive value,

00:04:20.485 --> 00:04:22.394
we're essentially going
to, if we're dividing it

00:04:22.394 --> 00:04:27.393
by -0.1, that's like
multiplying it by -10,

00:04:27.393 --> 00:04:30.136
so it's going to become
a very negative value,

00:04:30.136 --> 00:04:33.894
and if instead of it
being -3.1, imagine if it

00:04:33.894 --> 00:04:37.352
was -3.01, and this would be a 01 here.

00:04:37.352 --> 00:04:40.570
This would be a 01 here,
and this would be a 01 here.

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:44.219
And so this denominator,
you're dividing by -0.01,

00:04:44.219 --> 00:04:46.887
it's going to be even
larger negative value,

00:04:46.887 --> 00:04:49.452
so you're going to
approach negative infinity.

00:04:49.452 --> 00:04:50.960
So it's going to be one
of these two choices.

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:52.358
Now let's think about what happens

00:04:52.358 --> 00:04:54.942
as we approach x from
the positive direction,

00:04:54.942 --> 00:04:57.871
and that's what this
notation over there means,

00:04:57.871 --> 00:04:59.433
this superscript on the right hand

00:04:59.433 --> 00:05:01.154
side, the positive direction,

00:05:01.154 --> 00:05:04.400
so we're going to approach x
from the positive direction,

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:06.554
and I'm going to pay
attention in particular

00:05:06.554 --> 00:05:10.138
to the interval between -2 and -3,

00:05:10.138 --> 00:05:11.642
because then we know
we don't have any weird

00:05:11.642 --> 00:05:13.579
sign changes going on in the numerator.

00:05:13.579 --> 00:05:18.579
So I care about the interval -3&lt;x&lt;-2.

00:05:19.476 --> 00:05:20.841
So I can draw an open circle here

00:05:20.841 --> 00:05:23.981
to say we're not considering
when we're at -2,

00:05:23.981 --> 00:05:25.709
and of course we're
not going to include -3

00:05:25.709 --> 00:05:28.390
because our function isn't defined there,

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:31.932
but over this interval, so x + 1 is still

00:05:31.932 --> 00:05:33.338
going to be negative,

00:05:33.338 --> 00:05:36.552
x +1 is still going to be negative.

00:05:36.552 --> 00:05:41.068
If you took a -2.5 + 1,
it's going to be -1.5.

00:05:41.068 --> 00:05:43.066
x + 2 is still going to be negative,

00:05:43.066 --> 00:05:46.190
you're taking values that
are more negative than -2,

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:49.057
that are less than -2, so you add two

00:05:49.057 --> 00:05:50.857
to that and you're still
going to be negative,

00:05:50.857 --> 00:05:53.475
and then let's see, if you add three,

00:05:53.475 --> 00:05:55.283
if you add three to
these values, remember,

00:05:55.283 --> 00:05:57.464
they're greater than -3, or you could

00:05:57.464 --> 00:06:00.785
say they're less negative than -3,

00:06:00.785 --> 00:06:03.514
well then this is going to
give you a positive value.

00:06:03.514 --> 00:06:06.813
This is going to give
you a positive value,

00:06:06.813 --> 00:06:09.155
and think about it, q of,

00:06:09.155 --> 00:06:13.971
q of, I don't know, -2.99,

00:06:13.971 --> 00:06:15.511
what is that going to be equal to?

00:06:15.511 --> 00:06:20.391
If you add one to that, that is -1.99,

00:06:20.391 --> 00:06:22.893
and if you add two to that,

00:06:22.893 --> 00:06:25.991
times, times

00:06:25.991 --> 00:06:29.491
- 0.99

00:06:29.491 --> 00:06:33.726
all of that over -2.99 + 3,

00:06:33.726 --> 00:06:37.077
well that's going to be
0.01, so you're going

00:06:37.077 --> 00:06:38.785
to get a positive value on
top and then you're going

00:06:38.785 --> 00:06:41.458
to divide it by 0.01, that's the same

00:06:41.458 --> 00:06:43.493
thing as multiplying
by 100, so you're going

00:06:43.493 --> 00:06:45.500
to get larger and larger values.

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:47.115
You're going to approach
infinity as you get

00:06:47.115 --> 00:06:50.479
closer and closer to it
from the right hand side.

00:06:50.479 --> 00:06:54.028
So q of x is going to
approach positive infinity.

00:06:54.028 --> 00:06:55.409
So this is the choice that is correct.

00:06:55.409 --> 00:06:56.837
This one is wrong, this says we're going

00:06:56.837 --> 00:06:58.999
to approach negative
infinity, so that's incorrect,

00:06:58.999 --> 00:07:03.122
and we will go with that choice.
