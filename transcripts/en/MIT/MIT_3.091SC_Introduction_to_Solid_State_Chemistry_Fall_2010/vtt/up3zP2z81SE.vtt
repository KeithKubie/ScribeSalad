00:00:20.696 --> 00:00:22.670
PROFESSOR: This Wednesday
will be the first

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:24.470
celebration of learning.

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:28.830
Test 1 on Wednesday, October 7,
you will write during the

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:29.930
normal class time.

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:31.490
So you'll have 50 minutes.

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:37.210
And we want to have a little
bit of comfort here, so you

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:38.560
won't be sitting
cheek to jowl.

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:42.200
So before long I'll have
the room assignment.

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.520
So some of you will
write in here.

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.020
We'll have fewer people than
seats so that there'll be

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:50.180
vacancies next to each person.

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:53.270
And then some will write in a
few of the other locations,

00:00:53.270 --> 00:01:00.120
probably 26-100 and the gym
above the Walker Memorial.

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.730
And we'll get that out to you.

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:05.600
And next week on the 6th we
will have no weekly quiz,

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.670
because enough celebrating.

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.190
No point in testing you on the
6th and then on the 7th.

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:14.020
There will be, of course,
the mini-celebration

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:17.400
tomorrow, quiz 3.

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.790
And I'll be available for office
hours later today.

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:26.970
Oh, and the coverage, just to
remove the mystery, will be

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.930
right up to the 7th
of October.

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.540
I've been doing this for over 30
years and I've learned that

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:38.340
in order to inspire interest on
the part of the student it

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.420
really pays to have the coverage
of the celebration

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.710
extend up to the lecture
before the celebration.

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:48.120
Now obviously I'm not going to
drill deep on something I

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:53.130
taught you on October 5, but
it would be a good idea to

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.810
stay awake during all of the
lectures between now and then.

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.200
So last day we talked
about ionic bonding.

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.950
And ionic bonding occurs with
electrostatic attraction

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:07.080
between ions that have formed
through electron transfer.

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:10.990
And we saw the energy of the
ion pair given by this

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:14.010
formula, where we have
Coulomb's law

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:15.770
with the Born exponent.

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:17.540
And then this is plotted.

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:22.570
This is E at r equals r0, and we
learned that there were two

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:26.410
terms. The attractive term,
which is the Coulombic force

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:28.260
here shown.

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.860
And then there's a repulsive
term, which results from

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:34.640
electron-electron interaction
when the two lines get very,

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:35.950
very close together.

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:37.025
And this is taken
from your text.

00:02:37.025 --> 00:02:40.130
And I think they did a very nice
job here of illustrating

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:43.470
as you go to high values of r
they're depicting that you

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:46.590
have the ions separated by
considerable distance.

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.030
And there's a certain
amount of stored

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:49.770
energy, but not a lot.

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:54.470
And then if you go much, much
closer than the hard sphere

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.600
sum of the ionic radii, I think
they're depicting here

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:02.210
that there's some squashing
of the electron clouds.

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:04.520
And you can see that the energy
has gone way, way up.

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:07.980
So this is an unfavorable
situation, meaning that the

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:10.340
energy here is greater than 0.

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:15.880
And there's a sweet spot here
at 236 picometers, which

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:19.530
represents the ideal location.

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:25.590
And that is the sum of the
radius of the sodium ion and

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:27.100
the radius of the
chloride ion.

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:28.780
And so you can see how
energy tracks.

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:31.390
And if you go far, far, far
away to the point where

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:32.580
they're at infinite separation,

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:33.630
there's no energy stored.

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:35.830
So everything makes sense.

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:38.110
And then we said, well what
happens if we keep packing

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:39.510
these things?

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:43.530
We rationalized that they would
continue to do so and

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:45.760
ultimately form a 3-dimensional
crystal.

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:47.890
And so you can see there's a
lot of similarity between

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:49.650
what's above and what's
down here.

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:52.260
This has been written
for a 1-1 system.

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:56.000
In other words, a cation plus
1 and an anion minus 1.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.670
But it could be mediated
by the valences.

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:02.820
And what we have here is
the structure factor.

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:10.160
This Madelung constant tells us
how much we get decrease in

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:12.400
the energy of the system
by going to a

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:13.890
3-dimensional array.

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:16.650
So depending on the atomic
arrangement we'll have a

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:18.170
different value of Madelung
constant.

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:22.540
We saw that for sodium chloride
the value is 1.7476.

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:24.020
And different crystals have
different things.

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:27.000
And what determines the
crystal structure?

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.430
It's a combination of
the size of the two

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:32.070
ions and their valence.

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:35.730
So what we saw for sodium
chloride, this

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:37.020
is a structure type.

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:41.790
So obviously sodium chloride
is sodium chloride crystal

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:47.900
structure, but there is an
entire suite of compounds that

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:53.080
have radius ratios and charges
that end up with a sodium

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:55.510
chloride type crystal
structure.

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:58.660
And then towards the end we
started looking at the

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:00.130
Born-Haber Cycle.

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:02.540
And the purpose of the
Born-Haber Cycle was to give

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:07.830
us a sense of scale of the
various constituents in the

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:09.080
formation of a crystal.

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:11.520
And what we noted, the takeaway
message from the

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:15.810
Born-Haber Cycle, is that this
enthalpy of crystallization,

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:20.610
which is basically this
term here, is huge.

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:21.270
It's huge.

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:24.610
It was the big component of the
energy required to form

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:25.330
the crystal.

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:27.960
It's large and it is negative.

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:32.780
So what I want to do today
is start by talking about

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:36.880
shortcomings of the business
of ionic bonding.

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:38.630
See, how did we get
to ionic bonding?

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:42.390
We started with this idea
of octet stability.

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:44.890
Octet stability was
the driving idea

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:46.230
behind all of this.

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:53.030
Octet stability, and in the case
of ionic bonding this was

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:56.910
via electron transfer.

00:05:56.910 --> 00:06:02.300
And so that got us a long way,
but it has its limitations.

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:04.920
So let's put up some new data.

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:12.340
So suppose I look at compounds
like H2, N2, O2.

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:14.930
Do these things form
ionic bonds?

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:18.090
How does octet stability
play here?

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:21.120
And so let's start by
looking at hydrogen.

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:26.130
So if we took hydrogen and
started with atomic hydrogen

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:30.590
and added an electron to it,
then we would form an anion

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:32.870
known as H minus.

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:36.490
And H minus looks pretty good
because it's isoelectronic

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:37.730
with helium.

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:41.180
So maybe this isn't going
to be so bad a day.

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:44.150
But if we're going to have
a bond then we need

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:45.930
to form an H plus.

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:47.030
So let's do that.

00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:53.500
So that would be, then, H goes
to H plus, plus an electron.

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:58.700
And that's really nothing
more than a proton.

00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:00.250
So that doesn't look
too appealing.

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:01.820
That's probably a high
energy state.

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:06.140
And besides, in the same
location at the same time--

00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:09.630
in other words, same
temperature, same conditions--

00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:13.480
half of the hydrogens have to
acquire electrons and half of

00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:15.830
the hydrogens have to
lose electrons.

00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:17.340
And that's not going
to happen.

00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:19.840
They're either going to have a
propensity for electron gain

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:22.200
or a propensity for
electron loss.

00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:28.350
So it looks like ionic bonding
is not going to help us

00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:32.600
explain the formation
of molecules such as

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:35.130
H2, N2, and so on.

00:07:35.130 --> 00:07:40.110
So who came to the rescue
in this case to get

00:07:40.110 --> 00:07:41.760
us out of the conundrum?

00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:42.200
G.N.

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:43.450
Lewis.

00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:45.660
G.N.

00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:51.290
Lewis was actually born in
Weymouth, Massachusetts and he

00:07:51.290 --> 00:07:53.850
finished his PhD at
Harvard in 1899.

00:07:53.850 --> 00:07:56.300
And then, like so many Americans
of the day, went off

00:07:56.300 --> 00:07:58.640
to Europe and he postdoc'd
in Europe for a while.

00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:01.410
And then he came back and
got a job at MIT.

00:08:01.410 --> 00:08:05.280
And he taught at MIT
from 1905 to 1912.

00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:09.180
And then in 1912 he was lured
to the West Coast where they

00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:12.190
were starting to establish the
chemistry department, the

00:08:12.190 --> 00:08:14.200
University of California at
Berkeley, and he went out to

00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:17.860
Berkeley and that's where he
spent the rest of his career.

00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:20.850
And we can speculate
why he went.

00:08:20.850 --> 00:08:23.920
Maybe he was fed up with
the weather here.

00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:26.070
Actually, today is one of those
few days-- write it

00:08:26.070 --> 00:08:30.730
down, because one of the few
lovely days in Massachusetts.

00:08:30.730 --> 00:08:31.190
So G.N.

00:08:31.190 --> 00:08:32.990
Lewis, what did he say?

00:08:32.990 --> 00:08:34.760
He said, well I've
got an idea here.

00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:41.760
He said, what if hydrogen
achieved shell filling not by

00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:45.120
electron transfer but
by electron sharing.

00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:51.560
So he posited the idea of shell

00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:59.580
filling by electron sharing.

00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:01.970
This is in contrast to
electron transfer.

00:09:04.710 --> 00:09:07.430
So let's see.

00:09:07.430 --> 00:09:07.600
Oh.

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:09.100
There's an image of G.N.

00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:11.460
Lewis.

00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:13.030
He died, actually, on the job.

00:09:13.030 --> 00:09:14.640
He came back to his
lab one day after

00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:17.050
lunch and hit the floor.

00:09:17.050 --> 00:09:18.630
So he worked right
to the very end.

00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:25.450
Here's some data taken
from a lab

00:09:25.450 --> 00:09:26.950
notebook and memo, actually.

00:09:26.950 --> 00:09:30.220
1902.

00:09:30.220 --> 00:09:31.630
And what do you see here?

00:09:31.630 --> 00:09:36.280
Well, he developed a notation
for us, and we still use this

00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:38.870
notation to this day:
Lewis notation.

00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:41.160
So here's lithium and he's
got one electron.

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:43.810
But we know lithium has
three electrons but

00:09:43.810 --> 00:09:46.540
only one valence electron.

00:09:46.540 --> 00:09:48.600
And then there's beryllium
and magnesium--

00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:49.470
two electrons.

00:09:49.470 --> 00:09:51.360
Aluminum with three.

00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:55.050
Here's fluorine chlorine, and
when they ionize he puts the

00:09:55.050 --> 00:09:57.710
eighth electron right here.

00:09:57.710 --> 00:09:59.000
And look at this one
for silicon.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:03.530
He's got probably some kernel
inside the atom, thus.

00:10:03.530 --> 00:10:06.720
So he's even starting to think
about concentric shells.

00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:07.890
This is 1902.

00:10:07.890 --> 00:10:11.690
Remember the Bohr model
isn't until 1913.

00:10:11.690 --> 00:10:13.170
So you can see people
struggling.

00:10:13.170 --> 00:10:16.520
And notice that we have eight
electrons in a shell--

00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:18.500
that's where we're getting
the octet stability--

00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:19.740
and he's using cubes.

00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:23.550
Now we know that the cube isn't
the shape of the shell,

00:10:23.550 --> 00:10:26.160
but it's a pretty good device
to help you keep track of

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:27.470
electron number--

00:10:27.470 --> 00:10:29.350
because there's eight
corners on a cube.

00:10:29.350 --> 00:10:33.180
So it's another example of how
that's not what it is but it's

00:10:33.180 --> 00:10:36.220
a really good model and it keeps
you out of trouble and

00:10:36.220 --> 00:10:37.880
allows you to go forward.

00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:41.990
So this is going back-- way,
way back-- for G.N.

00:10:41.990 --> 00:10:42.560
Lewis.

00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:47.530
Now let's use this idea
and account for the

00:10:47.530 --> 00:10:49.930
formation of H2.

00:10:49.930 --> 00:10:53.160
So here's hydrogen, and using
the Lewis notation we'll put a

00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:55.870
dot here for its one electron.

00:10:55.870 --> 00:10:58.740
And we'll bring in a second
hydrogen and we'll use a

00:10:58.740 --> 00:11:02.800
cross, or an x, to indicate
the electron

00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:04.450
from the second hydrogen.

00:11:04.450 --> 00:11:06.465
And now we're going
to double count--

00:11:09.550 --> 00:11:11.070
in other words, double
attribute.

00:11:11.070 --> 00:11:14.660
These are shared electrons so
they count for both atoms.

00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:19.210
Double count the shared
electrons.

00:11:19.210 --> 00:11:21.610
And when you do so what
do you come up with?

00:11:21.610 --> 00:11:28.010
Well, the element on the left
has two electrons and,

00:11:28.010 --> 00:11:31.550
therefore, is isoelectronic
with helium.

00:11:31.550 --> 00:11:32.110
OK?

00:11:32.110 --> 00:11:33.410
Maybe it was a California
thing.

00:11:33.410 --> 00:11:34.650
They were sharing.

00:11:34.650 --> 00:11:36.350
And then there was
sort of another

00:11:36.350 --> 00:11:37.820
California concept, like.

00:11:37.820 --> 00:11:39.100
So it was like helium.

00:11:39.100 --> 00:11:43.660
And then on this side this
is also sharing.

00:11:43.660 --> 00:11:46.950
And it's kind of like helium.

00:11:46.950 --> 00:11:51.810
So now we've achieved the
stability of the filled shell

00:11:51.810 --> 00:11:53.690
by sharing the electrons.

00:11:53.690 --> 00:11:54.060
OK.

00:11:54.060 --> 00:11:56.960
And I think I even have
another slide of how--

00:11:56.960 --> 00:11:59.590
this is the more modern
version of it.

00:11:59.590 --> 00:12:00.610
Electron dot.

00:12:00.610 --> 00:12:04.260
So the nucleus and the
inner-electrons are contained

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:07.290
inside the chemical symbol.

00:12:07.290 --> 00:12:08.800
And, actually, this goes
all the way to

00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:09.970
modern quantum mechanics.

00:12:09.970 --> 00:12:13.050
Density functional theory does
the same thing: lumps all of

00:12:13.050 --> 00:12:17.920
the inner-shell electrons plus
the nucleus into one piece,

00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:20.780
and then the valence electrons
are outside.

00:12:20.780 --> 00:12:25.400
And so starting in 1902 with
some little dots and crosses

00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:28.050
we go all the way
to DFT today.

00:12:28.050 --> 00:12:29.560
All right.

00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:31.280
So let's do another one.

00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:32.770
How about nitrogen?

00:12:32.770 --> 00:12:33.800
Let's try nitrogen.

00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:37.080
So when we going to nitrogen
we know the valence

00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:39.460
electron's 2s2 2p3.

00:12:42.540 --> 00:12:44.070
So put nitrogen here.

00:12:44.070 --> 00:12:48.120
One, two, three, four, five.

00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:50.250
Now these three electrons
here are

00:12:50.250 --> 00:12:51.630
according to the Hund rule.

00:12:51.630 --> 00:12:56.005
So it's px, py, pz, and this is
the 2s2 sitting over here.

00:12:56.005 --> 00:13:00.710
And I'll bring in a second
nitrogen, and there's its 2s2.

00:13:00.710 --> 00:13:03.370
2px, 2py, 2pz.

00:13:03.370 --> 00:13:05.070
And now what do I have?

00:13:05.070 --> 00:13:06.850
Look at the nitrogen
on the left.

00:13:06.850 --> 00:13:08.500
Two, four, six, eight.

00:13:08.500 --> 00:13:12.360
So the nitrogen on the left
feels as though it has access

00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:12.990
to eight electrons.

00:13:12.990 --> 00:13:15.970
The nitrogen on the right--
two, four, six, eight-- it

00:13:15.970 --> 00:13:19.900
feels as though it has access
to eight electrons.

00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:25.390
So both nitrogens are
isoelectronic with neon if we

00:13:25.390 --> 00:13:28.010
push on this concept of
electron sharing.

00:13:28.010 --> 00:13:29.620
Now there's a second
thing I want to do.

00:13:29.620 --> 00:13:33.230
It's to draw attention to
two types of orbitals.

00:13:33.230 --> 00:13:37.320
So these three orbitals in the
center consist of electrons

00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:38.700
that are shared.

00:13:38.700 --> 00:13:43.140
So these are going to be called
bonding orbitals.

00:13:43.140 --> 00:13:46.125
And "bonding" and "blue" both
begin with a "b", so I'm going

00:13:46.125 --> 00:13:53.900
to denote the bonding orbitals,
or bonding domains,

00:13:53.900 --> 00:13:59.790
as distinct from the nonbonding
domains in red.

00:13:59.790 --> 00:14:01.545
Red are nonbonding domains.

00:14:04.270 --> 00:14:06.045
Always two electrons
per orbital.

00:14:06.045 --> 00:14:08.360
They like to live in pairs.

00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:09.740
That's the way it works.

00:14:09.740 --> 00:14:10.320
OK?

00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:13.280
And so each one of these
pairs is a bond.

00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:18.240
So I can then write nitrogen
with three lines through it

00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:20.220
indicating I have
a triple bond.

00:14:20.220 --> 00:14:24.710
Three pairs of electrons,
three bonding

00:14:24.710 --> 00:14:25.970
domains, triple bond.

00:14:25.970 --> 00:14:30.910
This is all in formation
according to the concept of

00:14:30.910 --> 00:14:32.510
electron sharing.

00:14:32.510 --> 00:14:36.210
And Lewis coined a name for
the type of bond that is

00:14:36.210 --> 00:14:37.720
formed in this way.

00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:50.720
He said we get bond formation
involves cooperative use--

00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:51.970
sharing, cooperative--

00:14:56.540 --> 00:14:58.210
of valence electrons.

00:15:02.710 --> 00:15:07.220
So now we can take the "co"
symbol here and the "valence"

00:15:07.220 --> 00:15:16.310
here and come up with the term
"covalent bond." Covalent

00:15:16.310 --> 00:15:18.700
bond, thanks to G.N.

00:15:18.700 --> 00:15:18.970
Lewis.

00:15:18.970 --> 00:15:22.970
So, again, to make sure we're
very clear, ionic bond results

00:15:22.970 --> 00:15:27.620
from electron transfer, covalent
bond results from

00:15:27.620 --> 00:15:30.200
electron sharing.

00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:33.950
Now we can do this-- so let's go
to heteronuclear molecules.

00:15:33.950 --> 00:15:34.980
These are homonuclear.

00:15:34.980 --> 00:15:37.230
So let's go to heteronuclear
molecules.

00:15:37.230 --> 00:15:39.690
And so let's see.

00:15:39.690 --> 00:15:42.710
I've got some rules
up here, I think.

00:15:42.710 --> 00:15:43.450
Yeah.

00:15:43.450 --> 00:15:44.470
Drawing Lewis structures.

00:15:44.470 --> 00:15:46.940
So let's go to a heteronuclear
molecule.

00:15:46.940 --> 00:15:50.385
And I'm going to choose as an
example sulfuryl chloride.

00:15:55.560 --> 00:15:57.100
And I don't expect you
to be able to name

00:15:57.100 --> 00:15:58.230
these things on site.

00:15:58.230 --> 00:15:59.620
I will always give
you the name.

00:15:59.620 --> 00:16:05.090
I'll say sulfuryl chloride,
parenthesis, SO2Cl2, blah,

00:16:05.090 --> 00:16:05.980
blah, blah.

00:16:05.980 --> 00:16:07.180
OK?

00:16:07.180 --> 00:16:09.690
So sulfuryl chloride.

00:16:09.690 --> 00:16:11.560
I want to put up the Lewis

00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:12.970
structure of sulfuryl chloride.

00:16:12.970 --> 00:16:15.910
So center the element with the
lowest average valence

00:16:15.910 --> 00:16:16.880
electron energy.

00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:20.790
So it turns out that the average
valence electron

00:16:20.790 --> 00:16:22.160
energy stack like this.

00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:28.160
Sulfur is the lowest, then
chlorine, and then oxygen.

00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:30.440
This is this ranking of average

00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:31.600
valence electron energies.

00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:33.900
And you'd be given those data.

00:16:33.900 --> 00:16:36.730
So it says put sulfur
in the center.

00:16:36.730 --> 00:16:38.640
So I'll put sulfur
in the center.

00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:40.610
And then what does it say?

00:16:40.610 --> 00:16:42.760
We're going to count all
the valence electrons.

00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:50.010
So sulfur over here
is 3s2 3p4.

00:16:52.780 --> 00:16:55.200
So that gives me six
valence electrons.

00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:56.930
And there's two oxygens.

00:16:56.930 --> 00:17:01.900
And oxygen lies above sulfur,
so that's 2s2 2p4.

00:17:01.900 --> 00:17:03.545
So that's 2 times 6.

00:17:06.620 --> 00:17:08.526
So that's 12.

00:17:08.526 --> 00:17:10.680
All right?

00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:12.350
Let's put the 6 over here.

00:17:12.350 --> 00:17:15.550
And then there's chlorines
in this compound,

00:17:15.550 --> 00:17:19.310
so that's 3s2 3p5.

00:17:19.310 --> 00:17:23.490
So that's 5 plus 2 is
7, 2 times 7 is 14.

00:17:23.490 --> 00:17:25.700
And we add this whole
thing up, we get

00:17:25.700 --> 00:17:28.910
there's 32 valence electrons.

00:17:28.910 --> 00:17:31.710
And draw a single bond from each
surrounding atom to the

00:17:31.710 --> 00:17:32.995
central atom.

00:17:32.995 --> 00:17:35.840
All right.

00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:36.950
Again, this is a model.

00:17:36.950 --> 00:17:39.270
I'm not saying that this is the
shape of the molecule, but

00:17:39.270 --> 00:17:40.010
it's a way to count.

00:17:40.010 --> 00:17:41.760
All I'm doing is trying
to keep track of

00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:43.640
bonds and paired electrons.

00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:47.900
So I can put chlorine
on either side.

00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:55.030
And I'll put an oxygen below
and an oxygen above.

00:17:55.030 --> 00:17:57.150
All right.

00:17:57.150 --> 00:17:59.770
So that's already two,
four, six, eight.

00:17:59.770 --> 00:18:03.350
So I'm losing eight.

00:18:03.350 --> 00:18:06.340
So 32 minus 8 is 24.

00:18:06.340 --> 00:18:10.990
And so with the 24 that means
I've got 12 pairs of

00:18:10.990 --> 00:18:14.560
electrons to place.

00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:16.410
So let's start putting the
Lewis structures up.

00:18:16.410 --> 00:18:20.780
So chlorine consists
of one, two, three,

00:18:20.780 --> 00:18:23.050
four, five, six, seven.

00:18:23.050 --> 00:18:24.780
And I'll do the same thing
on the other side.

00:18:24.780 --> 00:18:27.300
Two, four, six, seven.

00:18:27.300 --> 00:18:31.390
And oxygen has six, so that's
two, four, six.

00:18:31.390 --> 00:18:32.780
And then the lower
one, same thing.

00:18:32.780 --> 00:18:35.060
Two, four, six.

00:18:35.060 --> 00:18:36.340
And sulfur has six.

00:18:36.340 --> 00:18:37.810
I'm going to use
x's for sulfur.

00:18:37.810 --> 00:18:41.160
So I'll put one x with
the chlorine,

00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:43.280
another x with the chlorine.

00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:46.220
Two with the oxygen, two
with the oxygen.

00:18:46.220 --> 00:18:49.080
And so now we're in pretty
good shape, right?

00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:51.590
We can identify bonding and
nonbonding domains.

00:18:51.590 --> 00:18:53.920
Here's the bonding.

00:18:53.920 --> 00:18:58.160
One, two, three, four.

00:18:58.160 --> 00:19:00.440
And then the nonbonding.

00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:02.560
Looks like there's 12.

00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:10.435
And sure enough, 1, 2, 3, 4,
5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.

00:19:10.435 --> 00:19:12.070
The 12 nonbonding domains.

00:19:12.070 --> 00:19:13.130
4 bonds.

00:19:13.130 --> 00:19:14.760
And we have the Lewis
structure for

00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:16.490
this particular compound.

00:19:16.490 --> 00:19:19.660
And one last little piece
worth pointing out.

00:19:19.660 --> 00:19:23.450
Notice that in the bonds to
the chlorine you have two

00:19:23.450 --> 00:19:25.390
electrons, as you need.

00:19:25.390 --> 00:19:27.740
One electron comes from the
chlorine and one electron

00:19:27.740 --> 00:19:29.020
comes from sulfur.

00:19:29.020 --> 00:19:32.010
But in the bonds between the
sulfur and the oxygen the

00:19:32.010 --> 00:19:36.490
sulfur's so desperate to form
a bond that it actually

00:19:36.490 --> 00:19:39.720
donates both electrons
to the bond.

00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:43.180
And oxygen's happy because it's
isoelectronic with neon,

00:19:43.180 --> 00:19:45.830
and sulfur's happy because it's
going to be isoelectronic

00:19:45.830 --> 00:19:46.690
with argon.

00:19:46.690 --> 00:19:48.630
But, you know, it has to
go to some lengths.

00:19:48.630 --> 00:19:53.300
So this is called a dative bond,
when both electrons come

00:19:53.300 --> 00:19:56.510
from the one element.

00:19:56.510 --> 00:19:56.800
OK.

00:19:56.800 --> 00:19:58.100
Well, this is great.

00:19:58.100 --> 00:19:59.660
I'm going to do one more.

00:19:59.660 --> 00:20:03.550
How about methane?

00:20:03.550 --> 00:20:05.110
CH4.

00:20:05.110 --> 00:20:07.760
So I'm going to start
with carbon.

00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:09.330
Carbon's going to go
with this on there.

00:20:09.330 --> 00:20:14.220
And a carbon is 2s2 2p2.

00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:23.500
And so I'm going to use
the box notation now.

00:20:23.500 --> 00:20:28.590
See, this is the Lewis
structure, this is chemical

00:20:28.590 --> 00:20:31.450
equation, now we're going
to a box structure.

00:20:31.450 --> 00:20:34.040
We can move fluidly from
one model to another.

00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:35.670
We had cubes up there.

00:20:35.670 --> 00:20:36.620
It's all good.

00:20:36.620 --> 00:20:38.480
So this is 2s.

00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:44.130
And now this is 2px,
2py, and 2pz.

00:20:44.130 --> 00:20:47.420
Now according to this,
2s2, that gives

00:20:47.420 --> 00:20:49.450
me an electron pair.

00:20:49.450 --> 00:20:52.420
And now I've got 2p2, which
according to the Hund rule

00:20:52.420 --> 00:20:54.120
goes in like this.

00:20:54.120 --> 00:20:55.410
Well I've got a problem here.

00:20:55.410 --> 00:20:57.300
How many unpaired electrons?

00:20:57.300 --> 00:20:57.725
Two.

00:20:57.725 --> 00:21:01.635
Now what's my maximum number
of bonds I can form by

00:21:01.635 --> 00:21:02.886
electron sharing?

00:21:02.886 --> 00:21:05.170
It's two according to this.

00:21:05.170 --> 00:21:14.620
So the best I can do, best
possible here, is CH2.

00:21:14.620 --> 00:21:15.450
And that's no good.

00:21:15.450 --> 00:21:19.130
We know from mass measurements
it's CH4.

00:21:19.130 --> 00:21:21.230
The stoichiometry's CH4.

00:21:21.230 --> 00:21:24.530
And besides, what are these
orbitals going to look like?

00:21:24.530 --> 00:21:28.660
These are the p orbitals, so
they're dumbbell-shaped and

00:21:28.660 --> 00:21:29.850
they're orthogonal, right?

00:21:29.850 --> 00:21:33.200
They're 90 degrees, which means
if I formed this thing--

00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:34.650
which is called methylene--

00:21:34.650 --> 00:21:41.230
if I form methylene I'd end up
with CH2 looking like this,

00:21:41.230 --> 00:21:42.850
which has a dipole moment.

00:21:42.850 --> 00:21:46.070
And we know from spectral
measurements and electrical

00:21:46.070 --> 00:21:48.930
properties measurements that
this thing is symmetric.

00:21:48.930 --> 00:21:51.630
So this thing--

00:21:51.630 --> 00:21:53.430
electron sharing
isn't working.

00:21:53.430 --> 00:21:55.060
It's not working.

00:21:55.060 --> 00:21:59.790
So we need another patch here,
and that patch comes from none

00:21:59.790 --> 00:22:02.630
other than Linus Pauling.

00:22:02.630 --> 00:22:03.400
Another American.

00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:06.360
You see, it's American science
today and it's in the 20s.

00:22:06.360 --> 00:22:10.230
That's why we have Gershwin
playing at the beginning.

00:22:10.230 --> 00:22:11.780
Celebration of American
science.

00:22:11.780 --> 00:22:14.380
So Pauling was born in
Portland, Oregon.

00:22:14.380 --> 00:22:16.130
He was the son of a pharmacist.
And he went to

00:22:16.130 --> 00:22:18.990
Caltech, got his PhD in 1925.

00:22:18.990 --> 00:22:22.470
So the Rhapsody in Blue came out
in 1924 when he was just

00:22:22.470 --> 00:22:23.880
hunkering down to his thesis.

00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:26.390
Probably listened to it, got
some pleasure out of it, as

00:22:26.390 --> 00:22:28.110
most people did.

00:22:28.110 --> 00:22:32.970
So then he finishes, 1925, at
Caltech in Pasadena and he

00:22:32.970 --> 00:22:34.230
goes to Europe.

00:22:34.230 --> 00:22:35.440
Now he chose wisely.

00:22:35.440 --> 00:22:38.830
He chose four postdoctoral
positions.

00:22:38.830 --> 00:22:40.310
These are people he
postdoc'd with.

00:22:40.310 --> 00:22:42.990
First with Sommerfeld, then
with Bohr, then with

00:22:42.990 --> 00:22:45.220
Schrodinger, and then
finally with Bragg.

00:22:45.220 --> 00:22:46.100
You'll learn about Bragg.

00:22:46.100 --> 00:22:48.695
Bragg got the Nobel Prize
for X-ray diffraction.

00:22:48.695 --> 00:22:54.000
So that's not a bad
preparatory start.

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:57.310
So he comes back and
teaches at Caltech.

00:22:57.310 --> 00:23:00.450
In fact, I have a picture
of Linus Pauling.

00:23:00.450 --> 00:23:01.070
There he is.

00:23:01.070 --> 00:23:05.520
That's a middle-aged Linus
Pauling, probably around the

00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:09.720
time he got the first
of two Nobel Prizes.

00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:10.910
So what did Pauling do?

00:23:10.910 --> 00:23:14.850
Pauling said, why don't
we mix the orbitals?

00:23:14.850 --> 00:23:17.510
They're all in the shell n
equals 2, and what we're

00:23:17.510 --> 00:23:21.050
trying to do is to fill
the n equals 2 shell.

00:23:21.050 --> 00:23:23.180
So how about mix?

00:23:23.180 --> 00:23:33.550
Let's mix 2s and 2p states
in order to maximize

00:23:33.550 --> 00:23:34.500
the number of bonds.

00:23:34.500 --> 00:23:36.740
Remember, when you form a
bond you decrease the

00:23:36.740 --> 00:23:37.880
energy of the system.

00:23:37.880 --> 00:23:40.090
Four bonds is a greater
decrease in

00:23:40.090 --> 00:23:41.260
energy than two bonds.

00:23:41.260 --> 00:23:43.500
So the system, if it could--

00:23:43.500 --> 00:23:45.355
and they're all within
the same shell.

00:23:45.355 --> 00:23:49.500
You notice he didn't say, gee,
if mixing 2s with 2p is good

00:23:49.500 --> 00:23:50.910
let's go get some 1s.

00:23:50.910 --> 00:23:53.450
Well 1s is down in n equals
1, and there's

00:23:53.450 --> 00:23:55.190
no way you can mix.

00:23:55.190 --> 00:23:57.460
They had to be in
the same shell.

00:23:57.460 --> 00:24:07.550
Mix states in order to
maximize number of

00:24:07.550 --> 00:24:10.235
bonds that can form.

00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:14.480
It's all about maximize
the number of

00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:17.325
bonds that can be formed.

00:24:20.630 --> 00:24:23.740
And this, of course, is
by electron sharing.

00:24:23.740 --> 00:24:26.350
We're talking about covalent
bonds here.

00:24:26.350 --> 00:24:26.920
OK?

00:24:26.920 --> 00:24:35.170
And he termed these mixed
orbitals "hybrids." Termed the

00:24:35.170 --> 00:24:37.050
mixed orbitals as "hybrid
orbitals." They're

00:24:37.050 --> 00:24:39.120
cross-breed--

00:24:39.120 --> 00:24:41.720
part s, part p.

00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:45.490
So now let's look at the
energy level diagram--

00:24:45.490 --> 00:24:46.590
or the box notation.

00:24:46.590 --> 00:24:47.330
Forgive me.

00:24:47.330 --> 00:24:50.160
So I'm going to mix s and p.

00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:53.720
So I've got a single s and I've
got three p's, so this is

00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:55.260
called sp3.

00:24:55.260 --> 00:24:59.695
Each one of these is a mixed
sp3 hybrid orbital.

00:24:59.695 --> 00:25:01.370
And I've got four of them.

00:25:01.370 --> 00:25:03.610
And how many electrons
do I have?

00:25:03.610 --> 00:25:04.410
Four.

00:25:04.410 --> 00:25:07.270
So now I use the Hund rule
and in go the electrons.

00:25:07.270 --> 00:25:10.090
One, two, three, four.

00:25:10.090 --> 00:25:15.260
And now I have the ability
to form four bonds.

00:25:15.260 --> 00:25:16.460
But it gets better.

00:25:16.460 --> 00:25:17.480
Here's the next thing.

00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:18.870
These are degenerate.

00:25:18.870 --> 00:25:19.900
They're all in the same state.

00:25:19.900 --> 00:25:21.770
That's why we're using
the Hund rule.

00:25:21.770 --> 00:25:26.390
And so degeneracy in energy
implies degeneracy in spatial

00:25:26.390 --> 00:25:28.050
orientation.

00:25:28.050 --> 00:25:28.920
So what does that mean?

00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:32.500
It means that if these are four
bonds equivalent, then

00:25:32.500 --> 00:25:35.560
the way those bonds will arrange
themselves in space is

00:25:35.560 --> 00:25:36.740
to be equivalent.

00:25:36.740 --> 00:25:39.970
So if I've got a central carbon
here and I'm going to

00:25:39.970 --> 00:25:43.480
put four sticks from the central
carbon so as to make

00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:47.200
the four sticks symmetrically
disposed in space, that

00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:50.110
dictates the architecture
of the molecule.

00:25:50.110 --> 00:25:53.130
And how do I put four sticks
off of a central point

00:25:53.130 --> 00:25:54.960
symmetrically disposed
in space?

00:25:54.960 --> 00:25:57.720
One, two, three, and four.

00:25:57.720 --> 00:26:00.640
This is meant to be the corners
of a tetrahedron.

00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:03.520
Each one of these is
109 degrees apart.

00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:07.060
And this describes
a tetrahedron.

00:26:07.060 --> 00:26:10.670
So now I've got carbon in the
center, and now I've got the

00:26:10.670 --> 00:26:14.900
hydrogens at the four corners
of a tetrahedron.

00:26:14.900 --> 00:26:17.810
There is the structure
of methane.

00:26:17.810 --> 00:26:21.080
And each of the hydrogens has
a shared electron with the

00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:24.040
carbon, making it isoelectronic
with helium.

00:26:24.040 --> 00:26:28.220
And the carbon has four of its
own electrons, four shared

00:26:28.220 --> 00:26:30.080
with the four hydrogens
to make it

00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:31.360
isoelectronic with neon.

00:26:31.360 --> 00:26:32.700
So everybody's happy.

00:26:32.700 --> 00:26:35.920
Shell filling, and
it's all good.

00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:39.800
So now it's symmetric and it
has no net dipole moment.

00:26:39.800 --> 00:26:43.180
Everything squares
with the data.

00:26:43.180 --> 00:26:45.330
Well, good for Pauling.

00:26:45.330 --> 00:26:46.000
But he went further.

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:47.550
He went much further.

00:26:47.550 --> 00:26:50.890
What Pauling wanted to do was
to make it quantitative.

00:26:50.890 --> 00:26:54.020
And so he wanted to have
something analogous in

00:26:54.020 --> 00:26:58.100
covalent bonding to what we
have in ionic bonding.

00:26:58.100 --> 00:27:01.740
So what Leslie is now rubbing
off the board there is--

00:27:01.740 --> 00:27:02.390
no, keep going.

00:27:02.390 --> 00:27:02.670
It's good.

00:27:02.670 --> 00:27:03.490
It's OK.

00:27:03.490 --> 00:27:06.810
This is a rule of academics:
You always erase that which

00:27:06.810 --> 00:27:08.160
you will refer back to.

00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:10.330
We need more boards in here.

00:27:10.330 --> 00:27:12.430
How many boards do I
fill in a period?

00:27:12.430 --> 00:27:14.120
9, 18?

00:27:14.120 --> 00:27:14.580
Maybe what?

00:27:14.580 --> 00:27:16.580
We need about 24 boards.

00:27:16.580 --> 00:27:18.000
That's a good lecture.

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:18.420
All right.

00:27:18.420 --> 00:27:21.760
So here's what Pauling
was thinking about.

00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:25.170
He was thinking about the
analogy, for example, if I

00:27:25.170 --> 00:27:32.240
want to get the energy of
magnesium oxide I can use the

00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:36.060
formula that Leslie has
just erased, and

00:27:36.060 --> 00:27:37.060
it looks like this.

00:27:37.060 --> 00:27:41.320
So if all I need to know is the
radius of the anion, the

00:27:41.320 --> 00:27:45.910
radius of the cation, it's
charge, and the Madelung

00:27:45.910 --> 00:27:47.870
constant and then I just
plug in, I get the

00:27:47.870 --> 00:27:50.030
crystallization energy.

00:27:50.030 --> 00:27:53.640
But then suppose instead of
magnesium oxide I want to go

00:27:53.640 --> 00:27:56.690
to magnesium chloride.

00:27:56.690 --> 00:27:58.910
I can use the same formula
only I need

00:27:58.910 --> 00:28:00.150
the Madelung constant.

00:28:00.150 --> 00:28:02.940
This is the Madelung constant
for magnesium oxide.

00:28:02.940 --> 00:28:04.560
If I have the Madelung
constant--

00:28:04.560 --> 00:28:07.150
forgive me, script M--

00:28:07.150 --> 00:28:12.790
for magnesium chloride, and
I know the ionic radius of

00:28:12.790 --> 00:28:17.540
magnesium cation and chloride
anion, away I go again.

00:28:17.540 --> 00:28:18.270
I need this.

00:28:18.270 --> 00:28:19.760
I need, of course, the
Born exponent.

00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:22.440
This Born exponent
and away we go.

00:28:22.440 --> 00:28:24.260
The same formula applies.

00:28:24.260 --> 00:28:28.100
So I can build with a library
of basic physical data.

00:28:28.100 --> 00:28:29.580
So what did Pauling do?

00:28:29.580 --> 00:28:32.470
Pauling said, what if we
can do the same thing

00:28:32.470 --> 00:28:34.340
for covalent bonds?

00:28:34.340 --> 00:28:37.250
Is there some kind
of an analogy?

00:28:37.250 --> 00:28:42.100
So he said, let's take a
look at an arbitrary

00:28:42.100 --> 00:28:43.310
heteronuclear compound.

00:28:43.310 --> 00:28:47.790
So I'm going to do this with
HF, hydrogen fluoride.

00:28:47.790 --> 00:28:50.680
So, first of all, let's build a
hydrogen fluoride molecule.

00:28:50.680 --> 00:28:54.090
H with its one electron, and
fluorine with its seven.

00:28:57.510 --> 00:29:01.900
So now hydrogen sharing an
electron with fluorine is

00:29:01.900 --> 00:29:03.790
isoelectronic with helium.

00:29:03.790 --> 00:29:04.470
It's happy.

00:29:04.470 --> 00:29:07.220
And fluorine sharing the
electron hydrogen is

00:29:07.220 --> 00:29:09.060
isoelectronic with neon.

00:29:09.060 --> 00:29:10.010
It's happy.

00:29:10.010 --> 00:29:17.840
So again we see shell filling
by electron sharing.

00:29:17.840 --> 00:29:24.020
So what Pauling wanted to ask
is, can I get a measure of the

00:29:24.020 --> 00:29:30.890
HF bond energy knowing
only the bond

00:29:30.890 --> 00:29:35.560
energies of H-H and F-F?

00:29:35.560 --> 00:29:38.240
So then if I knew all the
homonuclear bond energies and

00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:41.580
then I mixed these to make
heteronuclear bonds, is there

00:29:41.580 --> 00:29:44.050
a path from homonuclear
bond energy to

00:29:44.050 --> 00:29:46.560
heteronuclear bond energy?

00:29:46.560 --> 00:29:51.230
So let's look and see what
the numbers are.

00:29:51.230 --> 00:29:52.710
So hydrogen.

00:29:52.710 --> 00:29:54.370
The hydrogen bond's
fairly strong.

00:29:54.370 --> 00:29:58.200
It's 435 kilojoules per mole.

00:29:58.200 --> 00:29:59.780
That's mole of bonds.

00:29:59.780 --> 00:30:00.150
435.

00:30:00.150 --> 00:30:03.680
Fluorine-flourine is 160.

00:30:03.680 --> 00:30:07.040
And so what do you think
the value of the

00:30:07.040 --> 00:30:08.900
H-F bond should be?

00:30:08.900 --> 00:30:12.260
Well when I first look at this
I say, well it's part H and

00:30:12.260 --> 00:30:15.970
it's part F, so it's somewhere
between 435 and 160.

00:30:15.970 --> 00:30:18.140
I don't know if it's the
arithmetic mean--

00:30:18.140 --> 00:30:20.470
you know, add these two and
divide by two-- or maybe it's

00:30:20.470 --> 00:30:21.680
the geometric mean--

00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:23.710
multiply them together and
take the square root--

00:30:23.710 --> 00:30:25.630
but it's got to be somewhere
in between.

00:30:25.630 --> 00:30:27.040
What do the data show?

00:30:27.040 --> 00:30:33.460
The number's 569, which
is greater than 435.

00:30:33.460 --> 00:30:37.090
So I take a bond of 435 and
a bond of 160, I put them

00:30:37.090 --> 00:30:41.620
together I get 569.

00:30:41.620 --> 00:30:44.410
That's very, very strange.

00:30:44.410 --> 00:30:45.650
But Pauling was smart.

00:30:45.650 --> 00:30:48.250
Pauling said, I have
an explanation.

00:30:48.250 --> 00:30:55.200
He says, suppose when these
electrons are shared in

00:30:55.200 --> 00:31:02.260
between the two atoms, suppose
they're not shared equally.

00:31:02.260 --> 00:31:06.400
Suppose there is a displacement
of the electrons.

00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:08.620
So instead of putting them
dead center, as I've been

00:31:08.620 --> 00:31:12.400
doing up until now, suppose
the electrons are actually

00:31:12.400 --> 00:31:16.680
drawn closer to the fluorine.

00:31:16.680 --> 00:31:20.000
So we still have octet
stability, or in this case

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:22.880
duet stability, but
the sharing of the

00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:25.440
electrons is not equal.

00:31:25.440 --> 00:31:27.425
So this is charge
displacement.

00:31:31.160 --> 00:31:33.795
And what does charge
displacement constitute?

00:31:33.795 --> 00:31:36.605
Well, charge displacement
means stored energy.

00:31:41.180 --> 00:31:45.930
And Pauling quantified
that stored energy.

00:31:45.930 --> 00:31:49.820
And so what he did is he said
that you increase the bond

00:31:49.820 --> 00:31:54.250
strength by thinking of it
as a two-step reaction.

00:31:54.250 --> 00:31:57.730
So in the heteronuclear bond
that is a bond between two

00:31:57.730 --> 00:32:07.240
different atoms. So in a
heteronuclear bond we form by

00:32:07.240 --> 00:32:09.970
what-- and this is my coinage,
you don't see this

00:32:09.970 --> 00:32:12.310
anywhere in the book--

00:32:12.310 --> 00:32:16.930
two-step, share and then pull.

00:32:16.930 --> 00:32:20.160
So share is, as the name
implies, we share electrons to

00:32:20.160 --> 00:32:21.670
achieve octet stability.

00:32:21.670 --> 00:32:26.550
But then because we have unequal
atoms we pull towards

00:32:26.550 --> 00:32:31.680
one of the atoms. And which
one do we pull towards?

00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:34.150
Well, we pull towards the one
that's got a greater appetite

00:32:34.150 --> 00:32:35.370
for electrons.

00:32:35.370 --> 00:32:37.720
And we've already gone
through this concept.

00:32:37.720 --> 00:32:40.720
Which atoms on the periodic
table have the highest

00:32:40.720 --> 00:32:42.770
appetite for electrons?

00:32:42.770 --> 00:32:44.110
The nonmetals.

00:32:44.110 --> 00:32:45.730
The weakest appetite
is the metals.

00:32:45.730 --> 00:32:47.430
The metals are good donors, the

00:32:47.430 --> 00:32:49.200
nonmetals are good acceptors.

00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:52.320
And fluorine's up in the top
right corner, so fluorine has

00:32:52.320 --> 00:32:54.830
a very, very high appetite
for electrons.

00:32:54.830 --> 00:32:57.680
And, indeed, in this bond
the electrons are

00:32:57.680 --> 00:32:59.660
pulled to the right.

00:32:59.660 --> 00:33:04.240
And why Pauling got the Nobel
Prize and Lewis didn't-- it's

00:33:04.240 --> 00:33:07.170
my theory-- is that Pauling
was quantitative.

00:33:07.170 --> 00:33:10.020
So he came up with a
quantitative measure.

00:33:10.020 --> 00:33:22.830
He devised a quantitative
measure for the degree of

00:33:22.830 --> 00:33:35.000
unequal sharing, thereby
allowing us to make these

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:42.090
calculations with
some accuracy.

00:33:42.090 --> 00:33:50.620
And he called that quantity
electronegativity, and it's

00:33:50.620 --> 00:33:52.850
denoted by the Greek
symbol chi.

00:33:56.180 --> 00:33:57.000
OK?

00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:58.740
And he devised a whole scale.

00:33:58.740 --> 00:34:00.050
How did he get the scale?

00:34:00.050 --> 00:34:06.700
He looked at bond energies for
all sorts of pairs of elements

00:34:06.700 --> 00:34:10.110
across the periodic table and
went through an exercise with

00:34:10.110 --> 00:34:14.910
pencil and paper that today we
would call multivariable

00:34:14.910 --> 00:34:16.540
regression analysis.

00:34:16.540 --> 00:34:19.075
And came with a set of--

00:34:19.075 --> 00:34:19.420
[SLIDE APPEARING]

00:34:19.420 --> 00:34:21.150
PROFESSOR: Oh, I'll
come back to this.

00:34:21.150 --> 00:34:22.520
This is the structure
of methane.

00:34:22.520 --> 00:34:23.870
This is the s and p.

00:34:23.870 --> 00:34:24.810
Oh, let's take a break.

00:34:24.810 --> 00:34:25.950
You can stack.

00:34:25.950 --> 00:34:26.370
All right.

00:34:26.370 --> 00:34:27.300
So this is what methane
looks like.

00:34:27.300 --> 00:34:28.960
There's the s, there's the p.

00:34:28.960 --> 00:34:31.170
And the sp hybrid
looks like this.

00:34:31.170 --> 00:34:33.260
It's sort of an asymmetric
dumbbell.

00:34:33.260 --> 00:34:34.590
And these four things
stick out.

00:34:34.590 --> 00:34:35.684
And then you bond the hydrogens

00:34:35.684 --> 00:34:37.320
and there's the methane.

00:34:37.320 --> 00:34:37.960
OK.

00:34:37.960 --> 00:34:38.950
So here's what the

00:34:38.950 --> 00:34:41.100
electronegativity scale looks like.

00:34:41.100 --> 00:34:43.220
It looks a lot like the
scale for average

00:34:43.220 --> 00:34:44.550
valence electron energies.

00:34:44.550 --> 00:34:48.490
The nonmetals have the highest
appetite for electrons period,

00:34:48.490 --> 00:34:51.460
which means in a bond they're
going to hog the electrons.

00:34:51.460 --> 00:34:54.200
And the nonmetals have the
weakest appetite, and so

00:34:54.200 --> 00:34:58.040
they're going to end up having
the electrons in a covalent

00:34:58.040 --> 00:35:00.480
bond pulled away from them.

00:35:00.480 --> 00:35:04.750
So nonmetals have high
electronegativity, metals have

00:35:04.750 --> 00:35:05.605
low electronegativity.

00:35:05.605 --> 00:35:08.230
And now here's taken
from the text.

00:35:08.230 --> 00:35:12.600
And you see that the
electronegativity is periodic.

00:35:12.600 --> 00:35:16.090
If you go across a period the
metal has the lowest value and

00:35:16.090 --> 00:35:18.610
the nonmetal has the highest.
And there's fluorine, number

00:35:18.610 --> 00:35:21.220
nine, at a value of about 4.

00:35:21.220 --> 00:35:25.690
It's got the most intense
appetite for electrons.

00:35:25.690 --> 00:35:29.010
And then you jump down here to
sodium, et cetera, et cetera.

00:35:29.010 --> 00:35:32.260
Here we are going across the
lanthanides and whatnot.

00:35:32.260 --> 00:35:33.590
And this is taken
from your text.

00:35:33.590 --> 00:35:36.150
There's fluorine, 3.984.

00:35:36.150 --> 00:35:37.440
That's the thing.

00:35:37.440 --> 00:35:40.990
And down here we have very low
values of electronegativity.

00:35:40.990 --> 00:35:46.650
So with electronegativity
we are now able to make

00:35:46.650 --> 00:35:47.900
calculations.

00:35:50.140 --> 00:35:54.370
And this is the Pauling formula
for calculating the

00:35:54.370 --> 00:35:58.580
bond energy in a heteronuclear
bond starting from homonuclear

00:35:58.580 --> 00:35:59.280
bond energy.

00:35:59.280 --> 00:36:01.900
So let's continue with the HF.

00:36:01.900 --> 00:36:05.280
So if I want to get the
bond energy of HF

00:36:05.280 --> 00:36:06.430
I'm going to take--

00:36:06.430 --> 00:36:07.770
and this is the Pauling
formula--

00:36:07.770 --> 00:36:08.940
the geometric mean.

00:36:08.940 --> 00:36:12.940
So I take the bond energy of
hydrogen-hydrogen times the

00:36:12.940 --> 00:36:13.960
bond energy of

00:36:13.960 --> 00:36:17.700
fluorine-fluorine, and square root.

00:36:17.700 --> 00:36:20.290
So that's the geometric
mean of the two.

00:36:20.290 --> 00:36:24.360
And then comes the Pauling
piece that gets

00:36:24.360 --> 00:36:26.670
him the Nobel Prize.

00:36:26.670 --> 00:36:29.330
You take the difference in the
electronegativity between the

00:36:29.330 --> 00:36:37.220
two elements squared, and then
the factor 96.3 gives us the

00:36:37.220 --> 00:36:42.140
unit consistency with
kilojoules per mole.

00:36:42.140 --> 00:36:45.960
So the greater the difference
in electronegativity the

00:36:45.960 --> 00:36:51.110
greater the contribution here in
terms of the deviation from

00:36:51.110 --> 00:36:54.750
just the geometric mean of the
two homonuclear bond energies.

00:36:54.750 --> 00:36:57.730
Or put another way, if you have
a homonuclear atom such

00:36:57.730 --> 00:37:02.280
as H2, if it's chi H minus chi
H is 0, so this second

00:37:02.280 --> 00:37:03.620
term goes to 0.

00:37:03.620 --> 00:37:06.090
And obviously when fluorine is
one of the members you're

00:37:06.090 --> 00:37:07.540
going to get a very, very
high number, because

00:37:07.540 --> 00:37:08.730
this has the most--

00:37:08.730 --> 00:37:10.640
and it doesn't matter which
order you put them in because

00:37:10.640 --> 00:37:12.220
you're taking the square,
so it's always

00:37:12.220 --> 00:37:13.850
going to come out positive.

00:37:13.850 --> 00:37:17.220
And I want you to appreciate the
sense of scale here, so if

00:37:17.220 --> 00:37:18.750
we go in here we'll multiply.

00:37:18.750 --> 00:37:23.130
This is going to be
435 times 160.

00:37:23.130 --> 00:37:25.590
And I'm going to take the
square root of this.

00:37:25.590 --> 00:37:29.270
And then this is 96.3.

00:37:29.270 --> 00:37:30.830
And you look on your
periodic table

00:37:30.830 --> 00:37:33.040
this is 2.2 for hydrogen.

00:37:33.040 --> 00:37:35.250
Fluorine is 3.98.

00:37:35.250 --> 00:37:38.880
And I know there are different
tables of electronegativity.

00:37:38.880 --> 00:37:39.420
I don't care.

00:37:39.420 --> 00:37:41.750
Just whatever you've got
on your periodic table.

00:37:41.750 --> 00:37:44.580
The one in the book is a little
bit different but it

00:37:44.580 --> 00:37:47.060
all comes out in the wash.

00:37:47.060 --> 00:37:49.770
So you multiply all this out,
and we find that the first

00:37:49.770 --> 00:37:54.140
term is 264 kilojoules
per mole and the

00:37:54.140 --> 00:37:56.720
second term is 344.

00:37:56.720 --> 00:38:00.080
So this second term is even
greater than the first term.

00:38:00.080 --> 00:38:03.020
So the amount of energy in that
electron displacement is

00:38:03.020 --> 00:38:04.290
substantial.

00:38:04.290 --> 00:38:08.772
And if you sum the two
of these you get 608.

00:38:08.772 --> 00:38:10.220
Now you might say, well
wait a minute.

00:38:10.220 --> 00:38:15.030
The real number is 569.

00:38:15.030 --> 00:38:20.700
But 608 takes you in the right
direction and accounts for the

00:38:20.700 --> 00:38:22.610
contribution of electron
displacement.

00:38:22.610 --> 00:38:25.080
264 is just plain wrong.

00:38:25.080 --> 00:38:31.310
So this was an important
start for Pauling.

00:38:31.310 --> 00:38:35.050
And he has labels on these
two contributions.

00:38:35.050 --> 00:38:37.470
This first term, which is just
the combination of the

00:38:37.470 --> 00:38:44.150
homonuclear bond energies, is
called purely covalent.

00:38:44.150 --> 00:38:46.033
It's the purely covalent
contribution.

00:38:49.770 --> 00:38:53.430
And it's what I've been
referring to as the sharing.

00:38:53.430 --> 00:38:57.640
This is what you get
from sharing.

00:38:57.640 --> 00:38:58.080
OK?

00:38:58.080 --> 00:39:00.650
And then this second term here
with the difference in

00:39:00.650 --> 00:39:04.000
electronegativity is what you
get from what I've been

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:08.050
calling the pull on
the electron pair.

00:39:08.050 --> 00:39:12.580
And Pauling called this the
partial ionic character.

00:39:16.392 --> 00:39:19.390
He's not saying that there's
electron transfer, but it's a

00:39:19.390 --> 00:39:21.320
move in that direction.

00:39:21.320 --> 00:39:23.430
Partial electronic character.

00:39:23.430 --> 00:39:27.460
So what I've done here is I've
decided I'll make a sort of a

00:39:27.460 --> 00:39:30.130
panorama of what we've
seen up until now.

00:39:30.130 --> 00:39:32.510
And so I'm going to make
something called the electron

00:39:32.510 --> 00:39:36.380
sharing meter.

00:39:36.380 --> 00:39:37.090
All right.

00:39:37.090 --> 00:39:41.530
So if I look at a homonuclear
system like hydrogen.

00:39:41.530 --> 00:39:45.240
So my meter reads neutral.

00:39:45.240 --> 00:39:47.220
So the arrow's at 12 o'clock.

00:39:47.220 --> 00:39:49.920
The electrons are
shared equally.

00:39:49.920 --> 00:39:55.070
And then if I go to
HF what do I have?

00:39:55.070 --> 00:39:58.850
Well, I know that the fluorine
is pulling the electrons.

00:39:58.850 --> 00:40:05.050
And so we can designate that by
writing delta minus, delta

00:40:05.050 --> 00:40:07.900
plus. delta the physicists
use.

00:40:07.900 --> 00:40:11.300
The lowercase Greek delta
means little bit of.

00:40:11.300 --> 00:40:11.970
All right?

00:40:11.970 --> 00:40:14.920
So delta minus means it's
a little bit negative.

00:40:14.920 --> 00:40:18.100
And we've got charge neutrality,
so if the fluorine

00:40:18.100 --> 00:40:21.170
end is a little bit negative
then the hydrogen end has to

00:40:21.170 --> 00:40:24.150
be a little bit positive, which
means this thing has a

00:40:24.150 --> 00:40:27.320
net dipole moment.

00:40:27.320 --> 00:40:29.070
It's a dipole.

00:40:29.070 --> 00:40:31.430
And the arrow points to
the negative end.

00:40:31.430 --> 00:40:34.730
One way to think about it is I
put a little slash there and

00:40:34.730 --> 00:40:36.700
that starts to look a little
bit like a plus sign.

00:40:36.700 --> 00:40:39.160
You can come up with your
own way to remember it.

00:40:39.160 --> 00:40:41.590
So it's got a little bit
of a dipole moment.

00:40:41.590 --> 00:40:45.620
And people depict dipoles
usually as ovals, and they'll

00:40:45.620 --> 00:40:47.800
put a minus end and
a plus end.

00:40:47.800 --> 00:40:51.390
So it's net neutral but the
charge is not uniformly

00:40:51.390 --> 00:40:52.750
distributed.

00:40:52.750 --> 00:40:53.980
OK?

00:40:53.980 --> 00:40:57.410
So our sharing meter in this
case is going to show

00:40:57.410 --> 00:41:00.110
something to the right.

00:41:00.110 --> 00:41:03.900
We've got electrons that are
unequally shared, and that

00:41:03.900 --> 00:41:05.580
moves over to the right.

00:41:05.580 --> 00:41:10.890
And, you know, the dipoles have
interesting properties.

00:41:10.890 --> 00:41:12.530
Oh, there's a plot of
electronegativity

00:41:12.530 --> 00:41:15.620
3-bar in the bar plot.

00:41:15.620 --> 00:41:17.590
And actually this is
an interesting one.

00:41:17.590 --> 00:41:20.310
Just parenthetically, you
see hydrogen here?

00:41:20.310 --> 00:41:22.340
Hydrogen's weird.

00:41:22.340 --> 00:41:25.070
They put it in the periodic
table above lithium but it's

00:41:25.070 --> 00:41:27.040
not an alkaline metal.

00:41:27.040 --> 00:41:29.190
And you can see it just
doesn't belong there.

00:41:29.190 --> 00:41:31.690
And there's a lot of
conversation about putting it

00:41:31.690 --> 00:41:36.360
maybe somewhere centered above
the p block elements, because

00:41:36.360 --> 00:41:39.020
it certainly doesn't belong
next to helium.

00:41:39.020 --> 00:41:43.470
But it probably doesn't belong
above lithium either.

00:41:43.470 --> 00:41:45.030
Anyway, I thought that
was very interesting.

00:41:45.030 --> 00:41:47.910
I can tell from the
response of the

00:41:47.910 --> 00:41:50.190
class, why does he care?

00:41:50.190 --> 00:41:50.490
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:50.490 --> 00:41:51.370
PROFESSOR: All right.

00:41:51.370 --> 00:41:53.370
Now this is really--

00:41:53.370 --> 00:41:54.360
I'm going to use an
adverb here--

00:41:54.360 --> 00:41:55.846
this is really important.

00:41:55.846 --> 00:41:56.590
All right?

00:41:56.590 --> 00:42:01.410
So here's HCl, is a cousin of
HF, and you see in the upper

00:42:01.410 --> 00:42:05.430
frame it's just a bunch of HCl
molecules just bopping around

00:42:05.430 --> 00:42:06.990
any which way.

00:42:06.990 --> 00:42:09.850
So there's the delta plus
and the delta minus.

00:42:09.850 --> 00:42:13.380
Now if you take these dipoles
and you put them in an

00:42:13.380 --> 00:42:18.340
electric field they will align
themselves, and the positive

00:42:18.340 --> 00:42:22.275
ends will face the negative
plate and the negative ends

00:42:22.275 --> 00:42:23.800
will face the positive plate.

00:42:23.800 --> 00:42:28.960
And there's energy stored when
the random orientation goes

00:42:28.960 --> 00:42:31.090
into an ordered orientation.

00:42:31.090 --> 00:42:33.880
This is the principle
behind a capacitor.

00:42:33.880 --> 00:42:35.800
A capacitor is nothing
more than a whole

00:42:35.800 --> 00:42:37.790
bunch of aligned dipoles.

00:42:37.790 --> 00:42:41.460
So if you want to invent a
supercapacitor that we can use

00:42:41.460 --> 00:42:44.870
on a car to extend the range
of the automobile so we can

00:42:44.870 --> 00:42:47.960
reduce our dependence on
imported petroleum, you're

00:42:47.960 --> 00:42:49.650
going to look for molecules
that have a

00:42:49.650 --> 00:42:51.970
honking big dipole moment.

00:42:51.970 --> 00:42:57.770
That way you get more energy
per unit electric field.

00:42:57.770 --> 00:43:02.460
So, again, a simple idea that
tells me how to go and invent.

00:43:02.460 --> 00:43:04.830
I can go back to my office and
go and invent something right

00:43:04.830 --> 00:43:07.320
now just based on
this lecture 9.

00:43:07.320 --> 00:43:08.670
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:08.670 --> 00:43:09.930
PROFESSOR: See, you
go and invent.

00:43:09.930 --> 00:43:12.050
You start the company,
you make the billion.

00:43:12.050 --> 00:43:14.670
Remember good old Professor
Sadoway at MIT, and

00:43:14.670 --> 00:43:17.780
established the fellowship
for students, and so.

00:43:17.780 --> 00:43:18.260
All right.

00:43:18.260 --> 00:43:21.280
But you have to know what
a dipole moment is.

00:43:21.280 --> 00:43:23.320
Got to know what a
dipole moment is.

00:43:23.320 --> 00:43:23.640
OK.

00:43:23.640 --> 00:43:24.860
So there's the dipole moment.

00:43:24.860 --> 00:43:29.100
And then lastly I'm going
to put sodium chloride.

00:43:29.100 --> 00:43:30.820
So what's sodium chloride
look like?

00:43:30.820 --> 00:43:33.250
Well it's Na plus
and Cl minus.

00:43:33.250 --> 00:43:36.330
So the electron has transferred
completely.

00:43:36.330 --> 00:43:38.670
So this isn't even
sharing at all.

00:43:38.670 --> 00:43:41.020
So this is really
bury the needle.

00:43:41.020 --> 00:43:42.270
This is not sharing.

00:43:45.230 --> 00:43:49.570
In this instance the sodium
doesn't even get visitation

00:43:49.570 --> 00:43:50.555
rights to the electron.

00:43:50.555 --> 00:43:53.050
The electron's gone.

00:43:53.050 --> 00:43:56.990
Whereas here hydrogen gets to
see the electron on Saturdays

00:43:56.990 --> 00:43:58.190
kind of thing.

00:43:58.190 --> 00:44:03.000
Depends what kind of lawyer
fluorine had.

00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:04.990
That's what it all
boils down to.

00:44:04.990 --> 00:44:07.390
All right.

00:44:07.390 --> 00:44:09.690
This is the same thing that
I just showed you.

00:44:09.690 --> 00:44:12.380
But you see, the textbook
gives you, as the name

00:44:12.380 --> 00:44:13.920
implies, dense text.

00:44:13.920 --> 00:44:15.320
I gave you the sharing meter.

00:44:15.320 --> 00:44:19.380
The sharing meter is far
more expositive.

00:44:19.380 --> 00:44:19.740
All right.

00:44:19.740 --> 00:44:22.990
And then, finally, the percent
ionic character is given by

00:44:22.990 --> 00:44:24.050
this formula here.

00:44:24.050 --> 00:44:26.810
So this is 1 minus
the exponential.

00:44:26.810 --> 00:44:34.840
So the exp term, this
exponential of-- what is it--

00:44:34.840 --> 00:44:38.670
minus 1/4 times the
difference in

00:44:38.670 --> 00:44:41.220
electronegativities squared.

00:44:41.220 --> 00:44:47.380
This notation means e base
natural logarithms, minus 1/4,

00:44:47.380 --> 00:44:47.960
blah, blah, blah.

00:44:47.960 --> 00:44:49.250
That's what this thing is.

00:44:49.250 --> 00:44:52.080
So if you plug in, multiply by
100% you get something that

00:44:52.080 --> 00:44:53.680
goes from 0 to 100.

00:44:53.680 --> 00:44:59.540
So obviously when delta
chi is 0 you get 0%.

00:44:59.540 --> 00:45:02.150
e to the 0 is 1, 1 minus
1 is 0, and so you

00:45:02.150 --> 00:45:04.030
have no ionic character.

00:45:04.030 --> 00:45:08.130
And so if you plug in
the numbers for HF--

00:45:08.130 --> 00:45:13.620
so you're going to take this
difference here, square it--

00:45:13.620 --> 00:45:17.210
it ends up giving you 1.8, which
gives you a value of

00:45:17.210 --> 00:45:20.040
about 56% ionic character.

00:45:20.040 --> 00:45:24.490
So it's as though the electron
is sort of half transferred.

00:45:24.490 --> 00:45:27.760
But you might also look at
it from this perspective.

00:45:27.760 --> 00:45:30.110
If you take 344--

00:45:30.110 --> 00:45:37.120
because this is the partial
ionic character, which is the

00:45:37.120 --> 00:45:40.260
energy of electron displacement
over the total

00:45:40.260 --> 00:45:42.280
energy in the calculation--

00:45:42.280 --> 00:45:45.000
that turns out to be 57%.

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:46.610
So this stuff makes sense.

00:45:46.610 --> 00:45:49.390
There's a sensible metric
here at work.

00:45:49.390 --> 00:45:53.720
And so this is what Linus
Pauling got his Nobel Prize

00:45:53.720 --> 00:45:57.190
for, and it's the description
of polar covalency.

00:46:00.470 --> 00:46:02.850
And polar covalency is operative
when you have

00:46:02.850 --> 00:46:06.560
heteronuclear bonds, because
the two different elements

00:46:06.560 --> 00:46:09.920
don't share the electron
equally.

00:46:09.920 --> 00:46:12.525
And the Pauling formula allows
you to calculate that.

00:46:12.525 --> 00:46:17.900
And his formative book was
written in 1937, called The

00:46:17.900 --> 00:46:20.060
Nature of the Chemical Bond.

00:46:20.060 --> 00:46:20.870
OK.

00:46:20.870 --> 00:46:25.100
So turning to the last five
minutes, I want to bring to

00:46:25.100 --> 00:46:28.110
your attention some covalent
molecules.

00:46:28.110 --> 00:46:31.110
Today we're going to
talk about Freon.

00:46:31.110 --> 00:46:35.270
Freon was an invention, it was
a designer chemical, invented

00:46:35.270 --> 00:46:36.850
by Thomas Midgley.

00:46:36.850 --> 00:46:37.560
This is me.

00:46:37.560 --> 00:46:40.700
I named him "sp3." That's
his nickname.

00:46:40.700 --> 00:46:44.660
Thomas sp3, for the hybridized
orbital.

00:46:44.660 --> 00:46:47.810
So he was working at the
Dayton engineering

00:46:47.810 --> 00:46:51.130
laboratories in Dayton, which
was owned by General Motors,

00:46:51.130 --> 00:46:54.530
and he was working in the 20s
at a time when there were no

00:46:54.530 --> 00:46:57.160
refrigerators in American
kitchens.

00:46:57.160 --> 00:47:00.080
The only refrigerants that were
used were either toxic or

00:47:00.080 --> 00:47:02.160
flammable, things like ammonia,
methyl chloride,

00:47:02.160 --> 00:47:03.620
sulfur dioxide.

00:47:03.620 --> 00:47:05.390
And you read about horrible
accidents.

00:47:05.390 --> 00:47:09.740
People making ice cream at some
plant and the compressor

00:47:09.740 --> 00:47:12.170
blows up and two or three
people are killed.

00:47:12.170 --> 00:47:15.820
So it was deemed unsafe in
the American kitchen.

00:47:15.820 --> 00:47:19.660
In the 20s Midgley discovered
this molecule, which looks

00:47:19.660 --> 00:47:23.110
just like methane only we've
replace the hydrogens with two

00:47:23.110 --> 00:47:25.100
chlorines and two fluorines.

00:47:25.100 --> 00:47:28.440
So this is called
dichlorodifluoromethane and

00:47:28.440 --> 00:47:32.050
it's a chlorofluorocarbon,
a CFC.

00:47:32.050 --> 00:47:35.480
And this was fantastic stuff.

00:47:35.480 --> 00:47:41.170
It it was colorless, odorless,
tasteless, non-toxic.

00:47:41.170 --> 00:47:44.010
It was not just used as a
refrigerant, it was used in

00:47:44.010 --> 00:47:44.720
propellant.

00:47:44.720 --> 00:47:49.160
When I was your age all
of the sprays--

00:47:49.160 --> 00:47:53.400
whether it was hair spray,
shaving cream, any aerosol--

00:47:53.400 --> 00:47:56.255
was propelled by Freon-12.

00:47:56.255 --> 00:47:58.910
It was fantastic stuff.

00:47:58.910 --> 00:48:02.450
Well, it turns out that in
the upper atmosphere--

00:48:02.450 --> 00:48:03.710
you know, you go pss pss pss.

00:48:03.710 --> 00:48:06.610
You got people all over the
world doing this, eventually

00:48:06.610 --> 00:48:08.760
this stuff starts
floating away.

00:48:08.760 --> 00:48:11.130
And what turns out in the upper
atmosphere where we

00:48:11.130 --> 00:48:14.080
don't have shielding
from ultraviolet--

00:48:14.080 --> 00:48:16.190
you know how to do this
calculation, because you can

00:48:16.190 --> 00:48:18.070
look up the energy.

00:48:18.070 --> 00:48:20.040
And, in fact, it's part of your
homework, where you look

00:48:20.040 --> 00:48:24.070
at the energy differences and
the electronegativity

00:48:24.070 --> 00:48:26.960
differences, you can compute the
wavelength of light that's

00:48:26.960 --> 00:48:29.470
capable of breaking the
carbon-chlorine bond.

00:48:29.470 --> 00:48:31.950
And it turns out to be
in the ultraviolet.

00:48:31.950 --> 00:48:35.680
Once the chlorine is broken you
have a chlorine radical,

00:48:35.680 --> 00:48:39.330
and that chlorine radical goes
over here and attacks ozone.

00:48:39.330 --> 00:48:40.340
[CELL PHONE RINGING]

00:48:40.340 --> 00:48:41.280
PROFESSOR: Cell phone--

00:48:41.280 --> 00:48:42.530
out.

00:48:45.630 --> 00:48:48.879
Just get up and leave
out of courtesy.

00:48:48.879 --> 00:48:50.129
[CELL PHONE STILL RINGING]

00:48:58.360 --> 00:48:59.610
[LAUGHTER]

00:49:04.870 --> 00:49:06.120
PROFESSOR: Hello?

00:49:08.490 --> 00:49:13.440
The first year I was teaching
3.091 there was a Nobel Prize

00:49:13.440 --> 00:49:17.570
awarded to Mario Molina, who was
a faculty member here in

00:49:17.570 --> 00:49:21.720
Earth and Planetary Sciences who
had worked years earlier

00:49:21.720 --> 00:49:26.230
at University of California,
Irvine, and had speculated on

00:49:26.230 --> 00:49:31.540
the mechanism by which ozone
depletion occurs and linked it

00:49:31.540 --> 00:49:34.790
to rising levels of CFCs.

00:49:34.790 --> 00:49:36.040
Initially--

00:49:36.040 --> 00:49:38.180
that's why it says
a vindication--

00:49:38.180 --> 00:49:40.410
people pooh poohed it,
said it was crazy.

00:49:40.410 --> 00:49:43.100
There wasn't enough of this pss
pss to cause any trouble.

00:49:43.100 --> 00:49:45.870
But then later with the NASA
program they started taking a

00:49:45.870 --> 00:49:48.780
lot of images and they could
track ozone levels in the

00:49:48.780 --> 00:49:51.850
atmosphere and start seeing
that not only was ozone

00:49:51.850 --> 00:49:54.240
changing but there were actually
pockets where ozone

00:49:54.240 --> 00:49:57.150
was being depleted at an
accelerating rate-- because

00:49:57.150 --> 00:50:00.400
obviously the atmosphere isn't
constant composition and

00:50:00.400 --> 00:50:01.200
constant temperature.

00:50:01.200 --> 00:50:01.680
Duh.

00:50:01.680 --> 00:50:03.310
So anyways, yeah.

00:50:03.310 --> 00:50:04.270
There he is.

00:50:04.270 --> 00:50:06.320
And this was the paper that was

00:50:06.320 --> 00:50:09.670
published in 1974 in Nature.

00:50:09.670 --> 00:50:13.410
And this was done before
computers.

00:50:13.410 --> 00:50:18.560
The PC wasn't invented
and commercialized

00:50:18.560 --> 00:50:19.630
until the early 80s.

00:50:19.630 --> 00:50:21.990
So this was typeset, and the
person who typeset it

00:50:21.990 --> 00:50:25.080
obviously didn't take 3.091
because instead of "atom"

00:50:25.080 --> 00:50:30.420
hyphen "catalysed" we have
"atomc-atalysed." But even

00:50:30.420 --> 00:50:35.130
ignoring the spelling error in
a Nobel Prize winning paper--

00:50:35.130 --> 00:50:36.890
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:36.890 --> 00:50:39.340
PROFESSOR: --the Nobel committee
overlooked this.

00:50:39.340 --> 00:50:41.040
Yeah.

00:50:41.040 --> 00:50:42.000
So there it is.

00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:44.900
And then they went to
HFCs and so on.

00:50:44.900 --> 00:50:48.300
There's a lot of activity
in this.

00:50:48.300 --> 00:50:51.800
And what happened is when we
changed from CFCs to HFCs we

00:50:51.800 --> 00:50:53.920
had to change the design
of the compressors.

00:50:53.920 --> 00:50:56.050
And what happened was
everything got

00:50:56.050 --> 00:50:57.760
much, much more efficient.

00:50:57.760 --> 00:51:01.420
So this was an example of
necessity for a change that

00:51:01.420 --> 00:51:03.320
was driven by concern
for the environment.

00:51:03.320 --> 00:51:05.820
Instead of putting people out
of work and killing an

00:51:05.820 --> 00:51:08.942
industry, gave us much more
efficient refrigeration.

00:51:08.942 --> 00:51:10.830
And the last thing I'll
show you is this

00:51:10.830 --> 00:51:11.620
to draw your attention.

00:51:11.620 --> 00:51:13.280
This was in your textbook.

00:51:13.280 --> 00:51:16.770
This is the cap at the top of
the Washington Monument.

00:51:16.770 --> 00:51:19.080
The Washington Monument was
built to celebrate the

00:51:19.080 --> 00:51:21.530
American centennial, 1876.

00:51:21.530 --> 00:51:23.560
They finished it in 1884.

00:51:23.560 --> 00:51:26.780
And this is 100 ounces of
aluminum, because aluminum was

00:51:26.780 --> 00:51:27.970
a precious metal.

00:51:27.970 --> 00:51:30.100
It was priced higher
than silver.

00:51:30.100 --> 00:51:31.090
1884.

00:51:31.090 --> 00:51:34.490
Two years later Charles Martin
Hall and Paul Heroult invent

00:51:34.490 --> 00:51:37.140
an electrochemical process
that drives the price of

00:51:37.140 --> 00:51:40.430
aluminum down to the point
that we make beer cans--

00:51:40.430 --> 00:51:42.426
I mean soda cans--
out of it today.

00:51:42.426 --> 00:51:42.890
[LAUGHTER]

00:51:42.890 --> 00:51:47.580
PROFESSOR: And a good example of
how chemical innovation can

00:51:47.580 --> 00:51:48.940
lead to superior products.

00:51:48.940 --> 00:51:50.680
I'll see you on Wednesday.
