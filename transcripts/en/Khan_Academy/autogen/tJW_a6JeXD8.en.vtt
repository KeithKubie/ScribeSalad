00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.430
 . 

00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:03.360
 In the previous section we talked about 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.570
 If we start with a rope 

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:08.870
 He took his left side 

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:11.370
 I can take the right side 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.280
 And shake it 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.890
 Spold is a kind of turbulence 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:17.460
 In the rope 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.190
 The turmoil seems so 

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:23.270
 Move the rope up and down 

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:25.960
 The disorder will move in the rope 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:28.330
 He will move down the rope like this 

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:31.090
 They asked this in black 

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:33.950
 After the completion of the first session 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:35.870
 Up and down 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:38.300
 The thread will look like this 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.710
 If we wait a little, the rope will look like this 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.420
 Assuming I did this only once 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:46.980
 The rope looks like this 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.630
 Where the disturbance of the rope moved 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:52.570
 This disorder is moved in the cord 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:54.675
 In the previous section, we mentioned that the disorder 

00:00:54.675 --> 00:00:57.520
 Moving in the rope 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:59.580
 This medium (although no center is required) 

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:05.180
 The disorder is called: wave 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:07.690
 Specifically this wave here is called a pulse 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:11.260
 A pulse wave is called because we have one wave 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.140
 One disorder in the rope 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.010
 If repeated movement up and down 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:19.290
 If done after regular intervals 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.430
 The cord will look like 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:22.680
 So 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.660
 . 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:30.070
 I try to draw clearly 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:33.550
 It will look like this 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:36.280
 As the unrest moves towards 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:38.830
 right 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:41.870
 You will move to the right at a certain speed 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:44.510
 What I want to do in this section is to focus on 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:49.390
 This type of wave. These waves are generated 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:53.310
 At regular intervals 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.200
 It moves up and down 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.370
 With regular periodicity, we call it a periodic wave 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:08.979
 This periodic wave, the movement is repeated after regular intervals 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:11.980
 What I want to talk about is some characteristics 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:15.190
 For the periodic wave, the first thing you might think of 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:17.990
 What is the distance you move up and down 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:20.630
 What after this movement from the point of silence? 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:24.130
 If this is the place of equilibrium, 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:28.590
 This movement is far from balanced 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:29.640
 Above and below the point of equilibrium? 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.430
 This distance is called: waveform. 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:37.170
 This distance here, 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:38.420
 Called wave amplitude 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:44.340
 . 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.660
 Some sailors have an idea of ​​the wave height 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:50.660
 Wave height from the bottom 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:53.560
 To the top of the wave 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.730
 Capacity is of equilibrium position 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:57.480
 to the top 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:58.950
 Let me set the top 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:00.160
 I think you know the meaning of the summit 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.300
 The top is the highest point of the wave 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:05.580
 This is the bottom 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:08.510
 If you are in a fishing boat, you want to see the surge 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:12.280
 You want to know the height 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.920
 If your boat is here you'll be interested 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:15.760
 This distance 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:17.780
 In any case , 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:20.600
 This is the first idea 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:24.170
 About the wave. Not all waves are generated by me 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:25.980
 By moving the rope from the left side 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:28.430
 But I think you understand the idea, that these waves represent 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:32.680
 Multiple and different types 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:36.290
 Of waves. This distance 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:40.290
 From the position of equilibrium or from zero 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:42.330
 Is the capacitance 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:45.210
 The other question you may ask, 

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:49.890
 We knew the amplitude of the wave 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:51.850
 But what is speed? 

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:55.730
 How long does it take you to move from position to equilibrium? 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:58.050
 Then down and then back to equilibrium? 

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:03.630
 For each session What is the time period? 

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:06.070
 The cycle is the movement of the position of the balance up and down and return to the position of equilibrium again 

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:10.190
 What is the time period for each session? 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:13.640
 What is periodic time? 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:14.760
 We said it was a cyclical movement 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:19.350
 Each cycle is a repeat of the previous one 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:22.205
 Time to complete the cycle we call: periodic time 

00:04:22.205 --> 00:04:25.590
 . 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:27.560
 Time unit 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:30.420
 The movement may be repeated every two seconds 

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:32.570
 Two seconds after completing a full course 

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:33.610
 Up and down 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:36.080
 Two seconds 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:38.570
 How much more complete cycle 

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:39.820
 every second ? 

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:53.730
 . 

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:57.500
 In other words, how much 

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:58.840
 Seconds per session 

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:00.090
 We can write this 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:06.870
 . 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:12.200
 For example, periodic time may be 5 

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:16.260
 Seconds per session 

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.240
 Or it may be 2 seconds per session 

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:20.870
 But what if the question is: how many cycles per second? 

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:22.600
 We ask the opposite question 

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:25.480
 Do not ask about the time period, how many seconds pass to complete the course 

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:27.270
 To complete the course 

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:30.200
 But, every second, how many times do you complete a cycle 

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:31.440
 How many cycles per second? 

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:33.080
 What is the number of cycles per second? 

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:34.510
 This is the reverse of periodic time. 

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:37.600
 The symbol for the periodic time is 

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:40.160
 T is great 

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:41.410
 The frequency 

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:49.210
 . 

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:52.430
 Symbolized by the symbol F 

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:54.770
 A cycle per second 

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:58.240
 If you take 5 seconds to complete the session, that means 

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:08.550
 You complete 1/5 session every second 

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:10.510
 All I did was turn the figure upside down 

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:11.560
 Which is logical 

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:14.490
 Because periodic time is inverted frequency 

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:14.860
 vice versa 

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:17.160
 Periodic time is the number of seconds per session 

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:20.550
 What is the time period to complete a cycle up and down? 

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:22.710
 Frequency is the time when a course is completed 

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:23.670
 Every second? 

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:25.040
 Periodic time inverted frequency 

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:30.090
 We can say that frequency is 1 on periodic time 

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:32.180
 Or we can say that periodic time is 

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:34.580
 1 on frequency 

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:39.860
 If I told you I was shaking the left side 

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:49.060
 From this rope, 

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:52.300
 The equivalent unit per second is the Hz 

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:54.120
 I can write this, 10 Hz 

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:56.000
 You probably heard this unit before 

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.360
 10 Hz means 10 cycles per second 

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:03.770
 If the frequency is 10 cycles per second, the periodic time will be 

00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:05.540
 1 on 10 

00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:13.580
 Permission 1 on 10 seconds per session 

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:16.680
 If I can complete 10 courses per second 

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:19.560
 Per second 

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:23.690
 It will take me ten seconds to complete one session 

00:07:23.690 --> 00:07:28.460
 Another question that may be asked is what is the speed of the wave 

00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:31.170
 In this case to the right 

00:07:31.170 --> 00:07:33.010
 As I move the left side 

00:07:33.010 --> 00:07:37.700
 What is the speed of his movement to the right? 

00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:40.170
 Speed ​​is 

00:07:40.170 --> 00:07:42.770
 We need to know the distance 

00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:45.200
 Which the wave made after one cycle 

00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:47.270
 After one session 

00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:51.750
 After I moved this once, what is the distance? 

00:07:51.750 --> 00:07:54.520
 What is the distance from this point of equilibrium? 

00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:56.010
 To this point? 

00:07:56.010 --> 00:07:57.370
 We call this distance: wavelength 

00:07:57.370 --> 00:08:01.760
 . 

00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:04.480
 There are many ways that you can define 

00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:05.060
 Wavelength by 

00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:10.160
 You can define the wavelength as the distance of the primary pulse 

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:13.070
 After completing one cycle 

00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:16.390
 Or you can define it at a distance from a peak 

00:08:16.390 --> 00:08:17.360
 To the top 

00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:19.360
 This will be the wavelength as well 

00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:23.070
 Or you can define it from distance to bottom 

00:08:23.070 --> 00:08:24.100
 bottom 

00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:25.390
 So too: wavelength 

00:08:25.390 --> 00:08:30.240
 In general, you can define wavelength as 

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:32.880
 Distance from a certain point on the wave to 

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:34.700
 Same point on the adjacent wave 

00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:37.970
 That is the wavelength 

00:08:37.970 --> 00:08:39.940
 You complement this point to that 

00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:43.150
 Complete a complete course 

00:08:43.150 --> 00:08:45.090
 Then return to the same point 

00:08:45.090 --> 00:08:47.500
 When I say back to the same point, 

00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:48.450
 This point is not counted 

00:08:48.450 --> 00:08:51.220
 Because this point even though we are in the same position 

00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:52.670
 But we are heading down 

00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:53.940
 We want to get to that point 

00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:55.330
 We are in the same direction 

00:08:55.330 --> 00:08:57.390
 Note here that we are moving up 

00:08:57.390 --> 00:08:58.890
 We want to be heading up 

00:08:58.890 --> 00:09:01.590
 This distance is not wavelength 

00:09:01.590 --> 00:09:02.530
 For the wavelength 

00:09:02.530 --> 00:09:03.780
 We should go back to the same point 

00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:06.340
 Where we are in the same direction 

00:09:06.340 --> 00:09:08.920
 This is also the wavelength 

00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:12.630
 If we know the distance we go after one cycle 

00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:22.220
 Wavelength is the distance 

00:09:22.220 --> 00:09:31.625
 Which is interrupted by the wave after one cycle 

00:09:31.625 --> 00:09:34.590
 . 

00:09:34.590 --> 00:09:37.170
 Or after completing one cycle 

00:09:37.170 --> 00:09:41.130
 . 

00:09:41.130 --> 00:09:44.020
 Remember, periodic time is the time period 

00:09:44.020 --> 00:09:45.540
 To complete one session 

00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:48.340
 Up and down 

00:09:48.340 --> 00:09:51.600
 If we know the distance, we have learned time 

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:54.750
 How can we know 

00:09:54.750 --> 00:09:56.350
 the speed ? 

00:09:56.350 --> 00:10:02.175
 Well, speed is the distance over time 

00:10:02.175 --> 00:10:09.450
 . 

00:10:09.450 --> 00:10:12.340
 For waves: speed 

00:10:12.340 --> 00:10:14.260
 I can use vectors but I think you understand the general idea 

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:15.800
 Speed ​​is 

00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:17.650
 Distance traveled after one cycle 

00:10:17.650 --> 00:10:23.390
 The distance traveled is wavelength 

00:10:23.390 --> 00:10:27.640
 After completing a full course 

00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:30.210
 The wave will be cut off exactly this distance 

00:10:30.210 --> 00:10:31.910
 This is the wavelength 

00:10:31.910 --> 00:10:34.830
 And what time is 

00:10:34.830 --> 00:10:36.850
 To complete this distance? 

00:10:36.850 --> 00:10:39.180
 It will take me one periodic period to complete this distance 

00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:42.170
 Speed ​​is the wavelength on periodic time 

00:10:42.170 --> 00:10:46.320
 . 

00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:50.790
 Well I just said that 1 on periodic time is 

00:10:50.790 --> 00:10:51.410
 Frequency 

00:10:51.410 --> 00:10:54.910
 I can write speed as wavelength 

00:10:54.910 --> 00:10:57.570
 For clarification 

00:10:57.570 --> 00:11:00.540
 The symbol used for the wavelength is 

00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:01.810
 Latin letter: lambda 

00:11:01.810 --> 00:11:06.550
 We can say that speed is equal 

00:11:06.550 --> 00:11:09.510
 Wavelength on periodic time 

00:11:09.510 --> 00:11:11.170
 It is also wavelength 

00:11:11.170 --> 00:11:14.110
 Hit 1 on periodic time 

00:11:14.110 --> 00:11:17.050
 We said that 1 on periodic time is 

00:11:17.050 --> 00:11:18.570
 Frequency 

00:11:18.570 --> 00:11:21.650
 So speed is 

00:11:21.650 --> 00:11:25.600
 Frequency wavelength multiplexing 

00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:28.090
 If you know this, you can solve all the issues 

00:11:28.090 --> 00:11:31.470
 Which belong to waves 

00:11:31.470 --> 00:11:34.400
 For example, if you know that 

00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:42.520
 I have a speed of 100 meters per second 

00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:45.940
 To the right 

00:11:45.940 --> 00:11:54.410
 And that frequency is 

00:11:54.410 --> 00:12:00.770
 20 cycles per 

00:12:00.770 --> 00:12:04.370
 S, or 20 Hz 

00:12:04.370 --> 00:12:08.790
 If this is the information that 

00:12:08.790 --> 00:12:13.410
 Know about wave motion 

00:12:13.410 --> 00:12:15.160
 For this rope 

00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:18.020
 20 Hz means that you are in one second 

00:12:18.020 --> 00:12:19.960
 You'll see this rope vibrate up and down twenty times 

00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:23.020
 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 

00:12:23.020 --> 00:12:24.410
 18 19 20 

00:12:24.410 --> 00:12:26.280
 In one second 

00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:27.510
 You will see the vibration twenty times 

00:12:27.510 --> 00:12:30.960
 That's what we mean by 20 Hz 

00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:32.590
 20 cycles per second 

00:12:32.590 --> 00:12:33.495
 Data is speed 

00:12:33.495 --> 00:12:34.470
 Frequency 

00:12:34.470 --> 00:12:36.380
 What is wavelength? 

00:12:36.380 --> 00:12:39.380
 Wavelength in this case 

00:12:39.380 --> 00:12:45.130
 The speed is equal to the wavelength hit 

00:12:45.130 --> 00:12:47.780
 Frequency 

00:12:47.780 --> 00:12:49.380
 Divide the parties on 20 

00:12:49.380 --> 00:12:52.470
 Let's put units 

00:12:52.470 --> 00:12:58.110
 The speed is in meters per second, equal to 20 lambda 

00:12:58.110 --> 00:13:02.450
 Cycle per second 

00:13:02.450 --> 00:13:05.610
 If you divide both parties on 20 cycles per second you will get 

00:13:05.610 --> 00:13:14.010
 100 meters per second multiply 1/20 seconds per cycle 

00:13:14.010 --> 00:13:16.490
 The output becomes 5 

00:13:16.490 --> 00:13:17.370
 This becomes 1 

00:13:17.370 --> 00:13:21.760
 Seconds are canceled 

00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:23.680
 You get 5 meters per session 

00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:30.830
 5 meters per session 

00:13:30.830 --> 00:13:32.150
 Is the wavelength of this example 

00:13:32.150 --> 00:13:34.350
 The wavelength is 5 meters 

00:13:34.350 --> 00:13:37.130
 You can say 5 meters per cycle, but the wavelength symbolizes 

00:13:37.130 --> 00:13:39.810
 Distance per session 

00:13:39.810 --> 00:13:44.760
 In this case if the movement is to the right at 100 speed 

00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:47.440
 Meters per second and frequency 

00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:50.830
 20 cycles per second, this is the distance 

00:13:50.830 --> 00:13:53.700
 5 meters 

00:13:53.700 --> 00:13:57.050
 We can easily calculate periodic time 

00:13:57.050 --> 00:13:59.710
 The cycle time will be 1 on frequency 

00:13:59.710 --> 00:14:06.470
 1/20 seconds per session 

00:14:06.470 --> 00:14:10.190
 Using these formulas, I do not want you to save them 

00:14:10.190 --> 00:14:13.350
 But to be understood and logical to you 

00:14:13.350 --> 00:14:15.470
 In the hope that the passage will be clear and useful 

00:14:15.470 --> 00:14:18.380
 Using these formulas you can solve all the questions 

00:14:18.380 --> 00:14:22.770
 By knowing the value of only two variables 

00:14:22.770 --> 00:14:23.990
 To find the rest of the values 

00:14:23.990 --> 00:14:26.190
 Anyway, I hope you find this useful
