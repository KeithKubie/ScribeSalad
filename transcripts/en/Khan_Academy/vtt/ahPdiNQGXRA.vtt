00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.469
- [Sal] In the last video we looked

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:03.552
at three different
examples, really as a bit

00:00:03.552 --> 00:00:06.294
of a review of some of
our factoring techniques,

00:00:06.294 --> 00:00:09.307
and also to appreciate when
we might wanna apply them.

00:00:09.307 --> 00:00:12.720
We saw in the first
example that it was just

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:15.138
a process of recognizing a common factor.

00:00:15.138 --> 00:00:17.490
Once we factored that out, we were done.

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.230
In the second example, there
was a common factor, four.

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:23.268
Then, after that, we used, you could say,

00:00:23.268 --> 00:00:25.422
our most basic factoring technique,

00:00:25.422 --> 00:00:27.979
or one of our more basic
factoring techniques,

00:00:27.979 --> 00:00:31.297
where we say, what two numbers add up

00:00:31.297 --> 00:00:32.934
to the first-degree coefficient,

00:00:32.934 --> 00:00:35.167
and then their product is the constant.

00:00:35.167 --> 00:00:38.663
And we were able to factor the expression.

00:00:38.663 --> 00:00:41.268
Then, in the third
example, we, once again,

00:00:41.268 --> 00:00:45.121
started off by factoring
out a common value,

00:00:45.121 --> 00:00:46.700
which, in this case, was three.

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:48.856
We could've done it the same
way we did the second one,

00:00:48.856 --> 00:00:50.562
or we could've immediately recognized

00:00:50.562 --> 00:00:52.758
that this is a perfect-square polynomial.

00:00:52.758 --> 00:00:55.926
But either way, we were able
to factor the expression.

00:00:55.926 --> 00:01:00.678
Let's keep going to see if we
can tackle some other types

00:01:00.678 --> 00:01:04.845
of polynomials that might
require some other techniques.

00:01:07.136 --> 00:01:09.803
Let's say we have the expression

00:01:11.257 --> 00:01:13.498
seven x squared minus 63.

00:01:13.498 --> 00:01:14.638
Like always, pause this video,

00:01:14.638 --> 00:01:17.736
and see if you can factor that.

00:01:17.736 --> 00:01:20.191
I've intentionally designed
all of these so that you

00:01:20.191 --> 00:01:22.507
can check whether there's a
common factor across the terms,

00:01:22.507 --> 00:01:24.700
and here they're all divisible by seven.

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:26.233
If you factor out a seven, you're gonna

00:01:26.233 --> 00:01:29.812
get seven times x-squared minus nine.

00:01:29.812 --> 00:01:31.719
You might immediately recognize this

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:33.143
as a difference of squares.

00:01:33.143 --> 00:01:36.390
You have x squared minus
this right over here

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.013
is three squared.

00:01:38.013 --> 00:01:40.133
Minus three squared.

00:01:40.133 --> 00:01:43.158
If the term difference of
squares or how to factor them

00:01:43.158 --> 00:01:45.691
is completely foreign to
you, I encourage you to watch

00:01:45.691 --> 00:01:47.540
the videos on factoring
difference of squares

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:50.260
or do a search on Khan Academy
for difference of squares.

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:51.470
But you will see, when you have

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:52.932
a difference of squares like this,

00:01:52.932 --> 00:01:57.280
it can be factored as seven,
this is just a seven out front,

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.163
and then this part right over
here, get a different color,

00:02:00.163 --> 00:02:02.238
this part right over here can be written

00:02:02.238 --> 00:02:05.738
as x plus three times x minus three.

00:02:08.044 --> 00:02:11.294
It is x squared minus three squared.

00:02:16.052 --> 00:02:17.554
Now, one thing to appreciate.

00:02:17.554 --> 00:02:19.300
This really isn't a different technique

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.737
than the one that we saw
in the previous video.

00:02:21.737 --> 00:02:26.006
If we just focused on
x squared minus nine,

00:02:26.006 --> 00:02:30.173
you could view this as x
squared plus zero x minus nine.

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:33.245
In that case, you'd say:
"OK, what two numbers

00:02:33.245 --> 00:02:37.412
"get me a product of negative
nine and add up to zero?"

00:02:38.804 --> 00:02:41.049
If I need to get a
product of negative nine,

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:43.558
that means that they
must be different signs,

00:02:43.558 --> 00:02:44.979
a positive and a negative; otherwise,

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:47.051
if they were the same sign,
you'd get a positive here.

00:02:47.051 --> 00:02:48.542
So they're different signs.

00:02:48.542 --> 00:02:50.388
Nine only has three factors.

00:02:50.388 --> 00:02:51.443
One.

00:02:51.443 --> 00:02:54.295
You could either have one and nine.

00:02:54.295 --> 00:02:55.653
There's only two combinations here.

00:02:55.653 --> 00:02:58.986
You could either have one or
nine, and three and three.

00:02:58.986 --> 00:03:03.456
And, if you make one
negative or nine negative,

00:03:03.456 --> 00:03:05.487
that's not going to add up to zero.

00:03:05.487 --> 00:03:07.032
But if you make one of
these threes negative,

00:03:07.032 --> 00:03:08.250
that does add up to zero.

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:09.821
Say, OK, my two numbers are gonna

00:03:09.821 --> 00:03:11.578
be negative three and three.

00:03:11.578 --> 00:03:15.425
So it's gonna be x minus
three times x plus three.

00:03:15.425 --> 00:03:17.211
Once again, I'm just focusing on what

00:03:17.211 --> 00:03:19.037
was inside the parentheses
right over here.

00:03:19.037 --> 00:03:20.254
You'd put that seven out front

00:03:20.254 --> 00:03:23.009
if we were doing this
exact same expression.

00:03:23.009 --> 00:03:25.244
But if you recognize it as
a difference of squares,

00:03:25.244 --> 00:03:28.902
it might happen for you
a little bit faster.

00:03:28.902 --> 00:03:31.019
Let's do one more example.

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:35.186
Let's say that I have two x
squared plus seven x plus three.

00:03:40.636 --> 00:03:42.423
In general, when my coefficient

00:03:42.423 --> 00:03:45.549
on the second-degree
term here is not a one,

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:48.840
I try to see is there
a common factor here.

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:52.091
But, seven isn't divisible
by two, and neither is three.

00:03:52.091 --> 00:03:54.530
So I can't use the techniques that I used

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:56.480
in the last few videos or even over here,

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:57.895
where I say: "Oh,
there's a common factor",

00:03:57.895 --> 00:04:00.412
and get a leading coefficient of one.

00:04:00.412 --> 00:04:02.320
If you see a situation like that,

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:06.487
it's a clue that factoring
by grouping might apply here.

00:04:07.843 --> 00:04:09.060
Factoring by grouping.

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:11.026
On some level, everything
that we've just done now

00:04:11.026 --> 00:04:15.294
you could view as special
cases of factoring by grouping.

00:04:15.294 --> 00:04:17.367
Factoring by grouping, you say, OK,

00:04:17.367 --> 00:04:21.268
can I think of two numbers that
add up to this coefficient.

00:04:21.268 --> 00:04:24.316
a plus b is equal to seven.

00:04:24.316 --> 00:04:28.052
a times b, instead of just
saying it needs to equal

00:04:28.052 --> 00:04:32.557
to three, it actually needs to
be equal to three times this,

00:04:32.557 --> 00:04:34.341
three times the leading coefficient,

00:04:34.341 --> 00:04:36.660
the coefficient on the x-squared term.

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:39.177
It needs to be equal to three times two.

00:04:39.177 --> 00:04:42.040
If you think about it, we've
always been doing that.

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:43.633
The other examples we gave,

00:04:43.633 --> 00:04:45.466
the leading coefficient was a one.

00:04:45.466 --> 00:04:48.173
When you took the constant term,
and multiplied it by a one,

00:04:48.173 --> 00:04:49.675
you were just saying a times b needs

00:04:49.675 --> 00:04:51.505
to be equal to that constant term.

00:04:51.505 --> 00:04:53.215
If you wanna talk about it more generally,

00:04:53.215 --> 00:04:56.627
it should be a times b
should be the constant term

00:04:56.627 --> 00:04:58.823
times the leading coefficient.

00:04:58.823 --> 00:05:01.419
In the introduction to
factoring by grouping

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:03.087
we explained why that works.

00:05:03.087 --> 00:05:05.814
You should never just accept
this as some magic formula.

00:05:05.814 --> 00:05:08.372
It makes sense for a very
good mathematical reason.

00:05:08.372 --> 00:05:09.793
But once you accept that,

00:05:09.793 --> 00:05:13.202
then it's useful to be able
to apply the technique.

00:05:13.202 --> 00:05:15.965
So can we think of two
numbers that add up to seven

00:05:15.965 --> 00:05:19.497
and whose product is equal to six?

00:05:19.497 --> 00:05:21.366
They're going to have to be the same sign

00:05:21.366 --> 00:05:23.435
since this is a positive value.

00:05:23.435 --> 00:05:26.797
And, they're gonna be positive
'cause they're the same sign,

00:05:26.797 --> 00:05:28.301
and if they're adding
up to a positive value,

00:05:28.301 --> 00:05:30.207
they're both gonna be positive.

00:05:30.207 --> 00:05:32.967
Well, let's see, one
and six seems to work.

00:05:32.967 --> 00:05:34.183
One plus six is seven.

00:05:34.183 --> 00:05:35.891
One times six is six.

00:05:35.891 --> 00:05:38.292
In factoring by grouping
we rewrite our expression

00:05:38.292 --> 00:05:41.340
where we break this up
between the a and the b.

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:44.665
So I can rewrite this as two x squared

00:05:44.665 --> 00:05:48.202
plus six x plus, I could write one x.

00:05:48.202 --> 00:05:49.137
Actually, lemme just do that.

00:05:49.137 --> 00:05:51.220
Plus one x plus three.

00:05:52.912 --> 00:05:56.662
As you can see, the
seven x, different color,

00:05:57.587 --> 00:06:02.102
the seven x has been broken
up into the six x and one x.

00:06:02.102 --> 00:06:04.544
That whole exercise I
just did is to see how

00:06:04.544 --> 00:06:08.891
we can break up this first-degree
term right over here.

00:06:08.891 --> 00:06:12.474
But then, what's useful
about this, is now,

00:06:15.432 --> 00:06:19.167
we can do the reverse of the
distributive property twice.

00:06:19.167 --> 00:06:21.667
So, for these first two terms,

00:06:23.071 --> 00:06:25.778
in a different color than I just use,

00:06:25.778 --> 00:06:29.228
these first two terms,
you see a common factor.

00:06:29.228 --> 00:06:32.502
Two x squared and six x,
they're both divisible by two x.

00:06:32.502 --> 00:06:34.910
So let's factor out a two x
outta those first two terms.

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:37.760
If you do that, two x
squared divided by two x,

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:39.505
you're just gonna have an x left over.

00:06:39.505 --> 00:06:43.485
Six x divided by two x, you're
just going to have a three.

00:06:43.485 --> 00:06:45.716
And then you have plus.

00:06:45.716 --> 00:06:48.643
Over here, this is a
special situation where,

00:06:48.643 --> 00:06:52.380
x plus three, there is no common
factor between x and three,

00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:55.997
so we'll just rewrite that, x plus three.

00:06:55.997 --> 00:06:57.457
When I put a parentheses on it,

00:06:57.457 --> 00:06:59.531
which is equivalent to writing
it without a parentheses,

00:06:59.531 --> 00:07:01.397
you might see something else.

00:07:01.397 --> 00:07:05.564
I can undistribute, or I can
factor out, an x plus three.

00:07:06.561 --> 00:07:08.148
What happens if I do that?

00:07:08.148 --> 00:07:10.381
I'm gonna get an x plus three.

00:07:10.381 --> 00:07:13.263
And then I'm gonna have
leftover in this term,

00:07:13.263 --> 00:07:14.683
if I factored out an x plus three,

00:07:14.683 --> 00:07:16.958
I'm just gonna have a two x left over.

00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:18.257
Two x.

00:07:18.257 --> 00:07:21.264
And then, this term, if I
factor out an x plus three,

00:07:21.264 --> 00:07:23.177
I'm just gonna have a one left over.

00:07:23.177 --> 00:07:24.596
Plus one.

00:07:24.596 --> 00:07:26.497
Lemme do it in that same color.

00:07:26.497 --> 00:07:28.081
Having trouble switching colors today.

00:07:28.081 --> 00:07:30.230
Two x plus one.

00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:32.264
And we are done.

00:07:32.264 --> 00:07:34.583
So, as I said, these are
all various techniques.

00:07:34.583 --> 00:07:36.165
On some level, factoring by grouping

00:07:36.165 --> 00:07:38.197
is sometimes viewed as the hardest one.

00:07:38.197 --> 00:07:40.882
But I'll say hard in parentheses because

00:07:40.882 --> 00:07:43.201
everything we did is
just a variation, really,

00:07:43.201 --> 00:07:45.474
a special case, of factoring by grouping.

00:07:45.474 --> 00:07:46.611
As you can see, it's all about,

00:07:46.611 --> 00:07:48.605
two numbers that add up
to that middle coefficient

00:07:48.605 --> 00:07:51.446
on the first-degree term when
it's written in standard form.

00:07:51.446 --> 00:07:53.353
Their product is equal to the product

00:07:53.353 --> 00:07:57.251
of the constant and the
leading coefficient.

00:07:57.251 --> 00:07:59.369
If you do that, you
break it up, it works out

00:07:59.369 --> 00:08:02.094
quite nicely where you
keep factoring out terms.

00:08:02.094 --> 00:08:04.231
This one, on some levels,
was a little bit more subtle,

00:08:04.231 --> 00:08:06.755
'cause you had to recognize
that this x plus three

00:08:06.755 --> 00:08:09.677
has a one coefficient on there implicitly.

00:08:09.677 --> 00:08:12.193
One times x plus three is the
same thing as x plus three.

00:08:12.193 --> 00:08:14.307
And then see that you can
factor out an x plus three

00:08:14.307 --> 00:08:16.746
outta both of these terms,
and then, once you do that,

00:08:16.746 --> 00:08:19.417
you're gonna be left
with the two x plus one.

00:08:19.417 --> 00:08:21.575
But all of these, if you
really feel comfortable

00:08:21.575 --> 00:08:24.199
with this arsenal of techniques,

00:08:24.199 --> 00:08:25.939
you're gonna do pretty well.

00:08:25.939 --> 00:08:28.456
Frankly, if none of these work, well,

00:08:28.456 --> 00:08:30.933
you might already be familiar
with the quadratic formula

00:08:30.933 --> 00:08:32.883
or you might be soon to learn it,

00:08:32.883 --> 00:08:36.631
but that's when the quadratic
formula might be effective
