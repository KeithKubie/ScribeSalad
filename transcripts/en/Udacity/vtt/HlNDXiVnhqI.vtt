[David] I'm happy to announce my new course on Applied Cryptography

00:00:03.427 --> 00:00:05.813
Cryptography means secret writing

00:00:05.813 --> 00:00:10.100
it goes back to the earliest human desires to keep and share secrets.

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:14.182
In the early days, cryptography was only available to generals and emperors

00:00:14.182 --> 00:00:17.233
but today it's used by nearly everyone everyday.

00:00:17.233 --> 00:00:20.516
Every time you do a credit card transaction, make a phone call,

00:00:20.516 --> 00:00:23.050
use a secure website, you're using cryptography.

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:27.783
In this class we'll start by learning the mathematical foundations behing cryptography.

00:00:27.783 --> 00:00:31.927
Then we'll see how to use cryptography to solve problems in computing.

00:00:31.927 --> 00:00:34.947
We'll see how to use cryptography to manage passwords

00:00:34.947 --> 00:00:38.829
and user accounts, to do secure transactions, to make money

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:41.378
from nothing but numbers, and to do computation

00:00:41.378 --> 00:00:43.363
while keeping your data private.

00:00:43.363 --> 00:00:47.212
Cryptography is a really fun topic: it's all about making and breaking puzzles.

00:00:47.212 --> 00:00:49.244
I hope I'll see you in class.

00:00:49.244 --> 99:59:59.000
CS 387: Applied Cryptography. Taught by Professor David Evans.
