00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.170
So let's assume that we have an unsatisfied clause

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:08.009
then we would pick one of those clauses and randomly flip one of the variables

00:00:08.009 --> 00:00:12.040
So, what I would like to know from you is what can we say about the condition

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:14.440
that we find ourselves in, in this case over here?

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:18.699
Is it true that at least one of the variables of that clause must be flipped?

00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:23.299
Is it true that all of the variables of that clause must be flipped?

00:00:23.299 --> 00:00:29.820
Is it true that the chances of flipping the correct variable are at least one-third?

00:00:29.820 --> 99:59:59.000
Or is it correct that the chances of flipping the correct variable are at most one-third?
