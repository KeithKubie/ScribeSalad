00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:16.000
 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:16.580
Hello.

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:17.940
I'm Terry Fisher.

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.560
This is the 11th of 12
lectures on copyright.

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:25.030
The topic for today is
supplements to copyright.

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:29.410
Included in that topic are two
main clusters of legal rules-

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:33.060
the doctrine of secondary
liability and the rules

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:36.050
recently adopted by many
countries that reinforce

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:39.850
so-called technological
protection measures.

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:43.310
As usual, I'll be focusing on
the law in the United States.

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:46.900
But I will also mention how
the issues addressed today

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:50.510
are implicated by multilateral
treaties and how countries

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:54.780
other than the United
States handle them.

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.280
During portions of the lecture, I'll
be using a map of copyright law.

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.660
The current version of
which can, as usual,

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.610
be downloaded from my homepage, the
address of which is tfisher.org.

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:08.960
 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:13.600
If copyright law were always obeyed,
either because people voluntarily

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:18.600
complied with its provisions or
because they were perfectly enforced,

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.742
the rules we consider today
would almost certainly not exist.

00:01:22.742 --> 00:01:26.510
But as I'm sure you know,
copyright law is not always obeyed.

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:32.850
Indeed, broadly speaking, the frequency
of disobedience seems to be increasing.

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.030
Some level of disobedience
is not necessarily terrible.

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:41.400
We tolerate moderate levels of
illegality in lots of fields.

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.670
For example, violations of speed
limits and of rules prohibiting

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.070
the possession of certain drugs are
common and have not, as yet, proven

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:51.440
socially catastrophic.

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:56.050
Indeed, in the context of copyright
law, some degree of disobedience

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:59.070
may be affirmatively beneficial.

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.730
Infringement provides
a mechanism by which

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:05.230
people who could not afford the prices
at which copies of copyrighted works

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:09.289
are sold can gain access to those works.

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:13.300
Because as you know copyrighted
works are non-rivalrous,

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:18.950
no one is injured when poor people gain
access to copyrighted works for free.

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:23.050
If people who could and otherwise
would pay for access to the works

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:27.460
begin to obtain them illegally for
free, then the copyright owners

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:29.880
do, of course, forfeit revenue.

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:34.050
But so long as the levels of
illegality remain moderate,

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:41.920
the resultant leakage is tolerable and,
as I say, arguably socially beneficial.

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.480
If the leakage becomes too severe,
however, then copyright owners

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.150
begin to suffer serious
injuries, and all

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:52.380
of the various values advanced
by copyright are imperiled.

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:55.990
Lawmakers in such
circumstances feel pressure

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:58.080
to address the problem in some way.

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.050
How?

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:04.160
One obvious answer is to increase
the civil and criminal penalties

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.750
for engaging in copyright infringement.

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:12.950
By making illegal conduct more costly,
lawmakers could reduce its incident.

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:15.790
We'll consider strategies
of this sort next week

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:19.840
in the last lecture in this
series when we discuss remedies.

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:25.370
For now, I'll note only that increasing
penalties is not always efficacious

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:29.510
and can have some serious side effects.

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:32.400
In this lecture, we'll
consider two other ways

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.080
in which lawmakers have attempted
to curb copyright infringement

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:40.370
and to reduce the associated
leakage of the system.

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:43.500
The first of those strategies
consist of bringing pressure

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:48.810
to bear on third parties, specifically
parties who do not themselves

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:52.960
violate any of the exclusive
rights enjoyed by copyright owners.

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:56.830
But who enable or encourage
violations by others.

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:00.550
The basic idea is that, if we
can force the third parties

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:03.220
to withdraw their support
for the infringers,

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:07.100
or, better yet, induce those
third parties to act affirmatively

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:13.950
to curb infringement, we can increase
the levels of compliance with the law.

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:17.300
Before plunging into the
details that currently implement

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:20.160
this broad strategy, we
should pause to consider

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:24.910
the theories underlying
this approach as a whole.

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:29.330
There are two general approaches used
to justify and shape this strategy.

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:31.910
The first is simple but important.

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:36.010
Encouraging illegality is
widely seen as immoral.

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:38.520
The person who encourages
lawbreaking may not

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:42.390
be as blameworthy as the
person who engages in it.

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:44.870
But it's still blameworthy
to some extent.

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:48.790
And thus, rightly subject
to legal penalties.

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:52.200
As we've seen, two of the
general theories of copyright,

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:55.070
the fairness theory and
the personality theory,

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:58.900
are founded at least in part
on moral considerations.

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:02.420
Viewed the lenses of those
theories, authors and artists

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:07.260
deserve either rewards for their
labor or continuing control

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:10.740
over projections of their personalities.

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:15.920
Conduct that fails to respect
their rights is immoral.

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:20.240
Encouraging conduct that fails to
respect authors' and artists' rights

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:22.350
is, thus, also immoral.

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:26.270
Perhaps to a lesser degree
but immoral nonetheless.

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:30.810
And thus properly subject
to legal penalties.

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:34.510
Sentiments of this sort, as we'll
see, color many judicial opinions

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:37.440
in this field.

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:41.300
The second approach is more
complicated and less intuitive.

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:44.090
It's associated with the
welfare theory of copyright

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:46.730
and more broadly with
the utilitarian approach

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:52.060
to law in general of which the welfare
theory of copyright is one branch.

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:55.850
This second approach is sometimes
called gatekeeper theory.

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:58.300
That term was invented
by Professor Reinier

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:02.300
Kraakman who pioneered this argument.

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:04.550
In a seminal article,
Kraakman points out

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:10.650
that in a diverse array of context,
the law and list third parties

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:16.580
frustrate or penalize
recalcitrant primary wrongdoers.

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:19.810
Examples include- the
liability sometimes imposed

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:24.690
on bartenders or social hosts when
their drunk customers or guests cause

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:29.360
injuries to themselves or others,
penalties imposed on accountants

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:32.950
when their clients engage in
fraud, and penalties employed

00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:37.100
on employers who hire
illegal immigrants.

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:39.990
In other words, employers who
facilitate the unlawful behavior

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:43.330
of the immigrants themselves.

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:46.080
Kraakman offers the following
analytical framework

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:51.640
to guide determinations of when it makes
sense to employ this general technique.

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:56.360
Quote successful gatekeeping
is likely to require, one,

00:06:56.360 --> 00:07:01.310
serious misconduct that
practicable penalties cannot deter.

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:06.120
Two, missing or inadequate
private gatekeeping incentives.

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:12.030
Three, gatekeepers who can and
will prevent misconduct reliably

00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:15.950
regardless of the preferences and
market alternatives of wrongdoers.

00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:19.830
And four, gatekeepers
whom legal rules can

00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:23.990
induce to detect misconduct
at reasonable cost.

00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:26.170
Close quote.

00:07:26.170 --> 00:07:28.600
For subtle application
of this framework,

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:31.030
to override the problems,
many but not all

00:07:31.030 --> 00:07:33.210
of which involves
securities regulation, I

00:07:33.210 --> 00:07:36.105
encourage you to consult
Kraakman's article, which

00:07:36.105 --> 00:07:40.470
is available in the spring 1986
issue of the Journal of Law Economics

00:07:40.470 --> 00:07:42.980
and Organization.

00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:47.390
Our concern here is, of course, not the
general theory of gatekeeper liability

00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:50.480
but with copyright law.

00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:56.180
As applied to copyright, Kraakman's
guidelines would suggest that penalties

00:07:56.180 --> 00:07:59.550
should be imposed on third parties
in hopes of suppressing infringing

00:07:59.550 --> 00:08:05.160
behavior by others only if one,
otherwise the incidence of copyright

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:09.340
infringement would be acceptably high
because directing for interest cannot

00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:12.600
be controlled by socially
acceptable sanctions.

00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:15.850
Two, the third parties,
left to their own devices,

00:08:15.850 --> 00:08:20.580
would not intervene to curb
infringement and indeed might foster it.

00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:23.280
Three, the third parties
we might target are

00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:26.800
in a position to effectively
suppress infringement.

00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:30.520
In other words, the direct infringers
cannot engage in unlawful behavior

00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:32.549
without their aid.

00:08:32.549 --> 00:08:37.620
And four, the social and economic
costs of penalizing the third parties

00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:41.460
are not unacceptably high.

00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:44.380
In many of the contexts I'll
be discussing this lecture,

00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:47.810
the first two requirements
are probably met.

00:08:47.810 --> 00:08:52.160
The third and fourth, however,
are not so invariably satisfied.

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:54.700
When assessing the imposition
of secondary liability

00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:59.230
in a particular context or
case, you should ask yourself,

00:08:59.230 --> 00:09:02.110
if we penalize this
particular third party,

00:09:02.110 --> 00:09:05.050
will the incidents of direct
infringement diminish?

00:09:05.050 --> 00:09:09.540
Or will the direction infringers
just find some other enabler?

00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:13.750
And what are the social costs
of imposing secondary liability

00:09:13.750 --> 00:09:16.300
in this setting?

00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:18.700
This last question will
be especially salient

00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:22.020
when dealing with so-called
dual use technologies.

00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:25.380
In other words, technologies
that can be and are

00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:29.380
used both to facilitate illegal
behavior and to facilitate

00:09:29.380 --> 00:09:33.660
lawful and socially beneficial behavior.

00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:35.790
When considering the use
of secondary liability

00:09:35.790 --> 00:09:39.590
to suppress such technologies,
you should consider carefully

00:09:39.590 --> 00:09:43.270
whether the social benefits
of blocking the bad uses

00:09:43.270 --> 00:09:46.290
exceed the social harms
of blocking the good uses.

00:09:46.290 --> 00:09:49.050
If not, then the use
of secondary liability

00:09:49.050 --> 00:09:54.230
reduces rather than
enhances net social welfare.

00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:58.550
So to review, deployments of
secondary liability in copyright law

00:09:58.550 --> 00:10:05.270
can and frequently are evaluated or
justified from one of two perspectives-

00:10:05.270 --> 00:10:09.670
the immorality of helping someone
to violate the rights of others

00:10:09.670 --> 00:10:13.290
and the possible though
not inevitable net benefits

00:10:13.290 --> 00:10:16.620
to social welfare of
enlisting gatekeepers

00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:21.900
to control otherwise
resistant forms of misconduct.

00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:27.270
With those two perspectives in
mind, let's turn to the law.

00:10:27.270 --> 00:10:30.550
In the United States, the
liability of third parties

00:10:30.550 --> 00:10:33.480
for facilitating the
infringing behavior of others

00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:37.080
is managed by two
offsetting sets of rules.

00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:43.020
The first set consists of doctrines of
contributory and vicarious liability.

00:10:43.020 --> 00:10:46.580
The second consists of a
set of statutory quote safe

00:10:46.580 --> 00:10:52.610
harbors close quote which are embodied
in Section 512 of the statute that

00:10:52.610 --> 00:10:54.880
immunize organizations
that otherwise might

00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:58.540
be liable either for direct
infringement or more likely

00:10:58.540 --> 00:11:02.930
for contributory or
vicarious infringement.

00:11:02.930 --> 00:11:07.460
This doctrinal structure should
by now be familiar to you.

00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:10.110
The doctrines of contributory
and vicarious infringement

00:11:10.110 --> 00:11:14.200
give copyright owners a
reasonably generous set of rights.

00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:19.670
Section 512 then carves out of those
rights some specific exceptions

00:11:19.670 --> 00:11:22.290
and limitations.

00:11:22.290 --> 00:11:26.540
This pattern, I hope you see, resembles
the relationship between Section 106

00:11:26.540 --> 00:11:32.140
on one hand and Sections 107
through 122 on the other.

00:11:32.140 --> 00:11:36.160
Broad grants of rights subsequently
qualified by exceptions.

00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:38.890
 

00:11:38.890 --> 00:11:41.670
The history behind this particular
incarnation of the structure

00:11:41.670 --> 00:11:42.700
is unusual.

00:11:42.700 --> 00:11:47.680
But the structure itself is
typical of copyright law.

00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:50.960
I will first briefly outline the
main features of these supposed

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:55.620
sets of rules and then examine a
few of the cases in which courts

00:11:55.620 --> 00:11:57.660
have struggled to apply them.

00:11:57.660 --> 00:12:00.600
 

00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:03.280
The doctrines of contributory
and vicarious infringement

00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:07.370
were developed by the courts with little
or no guidance from the legislature.

00:12:07.370 --> 00:12:10.620
Sometimes, these
doctrines are said to be

00:12:10.620 --> 00:12:14.880
rooted in the language of Section 106
of the statute, which, as you can see,

00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:19.000
gives copyright owners the
exclusive right to quote do

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.030
or to authorize close
quote any of the things

00:12:22.030 --> 00:12:24.920
we have considered in
the past four lectures.

00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:27.670
Third parties who encourage
copyright infringement

00:12:27.670 --> 00:12:31.280
might be said to be
quote authorizing close

00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:36.790
quote the infringing behavior, which,
as you can see, Section 106 forbids.

00:12:36.790 --> 00:12:42.010
But this is a pretty thin read on which
to rest a massive doctrinal edifice.

00:12:42.010 --> 00:12:44.370
It's more accurate and
honest to acknowledge

00:12:44.370 --> 00:12:48.570
that the courts have developed
these doctrines on their own.

00:12:48.570 --> 00:12:51.740
And that the copyright statute
does not meaningfully guide them.

00:12:51.740 --> 00:12:54.510
 

00:12:54.510 --> 00:12:58.860
The two doctrines are close
cousins but have different origins.

00:12:58.860 --> 00:13:02.630
Contributory infringement
emerged from general tort law.

00:13:02.630 --> 00:13:04.940
It's said to implement
the general principle

00:13:04.940 --> 00:13:07.690
that one who directly
contribute to a tort

00:13:07.690 --> 00:13:13.760
should be held responsible along with
the tortfeasor, himself or herself.

00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:17.110
The role played by the moral principle
I mentioned a few minutes ago

00:13:17.110 --> 00:13:20.630
should be apparent in this principle.

00:13:20.630 --> 00:13:23.960
By contrast, vicarious
infringement is an outgrowth

00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:28.470
of the law of respondeat superior,
the branch of the law of agency

00:13:28.470 --> 00:13:31.050
that governs the
responsibility of employers

00:13:31.050 --> 00:13:34.380
for the misconduct of their employees.

00:13:34.380 --> 00:13:36.980
In the early 20th Century,
the courts extended

00:13:36.980 --> 00:13:41.120
the respondeat superior principal
well beyond employment relations.

00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:45.050
To govern a variety of relationships
in which defendants did not

00:13:45.050 --> 00:13:47.770
themselves engage in
copyright infringement

00:13:47.770 --> 00:13:52.000
but had economic interests that were
intertwined with those of parties

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.250
who did engage in
copyright infringement.

00:13:55.250 --> 00:13:58.130
By the middle of the 20th
Century, the two doctrines

00:13:58.130 --> 00:14:02.920
had evolved to contain the
following requirements.

00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:06.680
To hold a defendant liable
for contributory infringement,

00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:08.940
a plaintiff must show three things.

00:14:08.940 --> 00:14:14.910
A, that someone had engaged in or
was engaging in direct infringement.

00:14:14.910 --> 00:14:19.250
B, that the defendant had
actual or constructive knowledge

00:14:19.250 --> 00:14:21.130
of that infringement.

00:14:21.130 --> 00:14:27.620
And C, that the defendant materially
contributed to that infringement.

00:14:27.620 --> 00:14:32.170
By contrast, to hold a defendant liable
for vicarious infringement a plaintiff

00:14:32.170 --> 00:14:34.750
must show three somewhat
different things.

00:14:34.750 --> 00:14:38.540
A, that someone had engaged in or
was engaging in direct infringement.

00:14:38.540 --> 00:14:44.120
B, that the defendant benefited
financially from that infringement.

00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:47.530
And C, that the defendant
had the right and ability

00:14:47.530 --> 00:14:50.320
to supervise the direct infringement.

00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:56.140
In other words, to stop
it and failed to do so.

00:14:56.140 --> 00:14:59.500
Note that while actual or
constructive knowledge is

00:14:59.500 --> 00:15:02.000
essential to contributory
infringement, it's

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.060
not necessary for
vicarious infringement.

00:15:05.060 --> 00:15:07.220
In that sense, vicarious
infringement partakes

00:15:07.220 --> 00:15:10.190
more of the principle
of strict liability

00:15:10.190 --> 00:15:12.570
than its contributory
infringement cousin.

00:15:12.570 --> 00:15:15.552
 

00:15:15.552 --> 00:15:17.510
The classic illustration
of these two doctrines

00:15:17.510 --> 00:15:20.555
was distilled from a set of
cases in the early 20th Century

00:15:20.555 --> 00:15:23.520
that involved dance halls.

00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:26.480
Suppose that a musical
group without permission

00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:28.990
performs some copyrighted
musical compositions

00:15:28.990 --> 00:15:31.220
in front of a public audience.

00:15:31.220 --> 00:15:35.310
The playlist, in other words,
the set of songs the group plays,

00:15:35.310 --> 00:15:39.040
had been selected by
the group's manager.

00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:42.200
The owner of the hall in which
the performance takes place

00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:45.890
keeps a portion of the ticket prices
paid by the members of the audience

00:15:45.890 --> 00:15:48.980
and makes no effort to
prevent the group from playing

00:15:48.980 --> 00:15:52.030
the songs without permission.

00:15:52.030 --> 00:15:56.760
Under these circumstances, the
owners of the copyrights in the songs

00:15:56.760 --> 00:15:59.650
would have three causes of action.

00:15:59.650 --> 00:16:03.460
A claim against the group
for direct infringement,

00:16:03.460 --> 00:16:06.580
namely, as you know by now, a
violation of the public performance

00:16:06.580 --> 00:16:10.800
right embodied in Section 1064.

00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:14.690
A claim against the manager
for contributory infringement

00:16:14.690 --> 00:16:16.760
because, although the
manager himself did

00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:21.620
not publicly perform any compositions,
he plainly knew of the band's plan

00:16:21.620 --> 00:16:24.010
and encouraged it.

00:16:24.010 --> 00:16:28.520
And finally, a claim against the owner
of the hall for vicarious infringement.

00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:32.960
Because, even if the owner did
not know of the band's plan,

00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:36.010
he is profiting from
the band's behavior.

00:16:36.010 --> 00:16:39.590
And he failed to exercise
his clear power to stop them.

00:16:39.590 --> 00:16:43.040
 

00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:45.850
All of this is straightforward, I hope.

00:16:45.850 --> 00:16:49.630
Now, let's consider a
few modern cases where

00:16:49.630 --> 00:16:52.280
the application of these
principles is less clear-cut.

00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:55.640
 

00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:59.550
A prosaic but influential case was
decided by the Court of Appeals

00:16:59.550 --> 00:17:02.450
for the Ninth Circuit in 1996.

00:17:02.450 --> 00:17:05.839
The defendant, Cherry
Auction, was the operator

00:17:05.839 --> 00:17:10.190
of this flea market, located
in Fresno, California.

00:17:10.190 --> 00:17:13.579
A flea market, otherwise
known as a swap meet,

00:17:13.579 --> 00:17:16.790
is a marketplace where a large
number of independent vendors

00:17:16.790 --> 00:17:22.390
sell merchandise, typically
inexpensive or used merchandise,

00:17:22.390 --> 00:17:25.480
to customers who come
hunting for bargains.

00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:28.850
In this instance, the
vendors, as is typical,

00:17:28.850 --> 00:17:33.220
paid modest rental
fees to Cherry Auction.

00:17:33.220 --> 00:17:36.740
Cherry Auction provided
those vendors booth space,

00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:42.400
operated the parking facilities,
and advertised the marketplace.

00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:44.700
In addition to collect
the fees for the vendors,

00:17:44.700 --> 00:17:49.030
Cherry Auction collected entrance
fees from the customer's.

00:17:49.030 --> 00:17:51.570
Finally, Cherry Auction
reserved the right

00:17:51.570 --> 00:17:56.060
to exclude any vendor for any reason.

00:17:56.060 --> 00:17:59.710
The plaintiff, Fonovisa,
Incorporated, Owns?

00:17:59.710 --> 00:18:03.800
The copyrights in a large number
of Latino sound recordings.

00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:06.280
Fonovisa complained several
times at Cherry Auction

00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:08.030
that sum of the vendors
in the flea market

00:18:08.030 --> 00:18:14.540
were selling pirated copies of
Fonovisa's recordings to no available.

00:18:14.540 --> 00:18:20.960
Finally, Fonovisa brought
suit against the flea market.

00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:24.840
Because Cherry Auction was not
itself copying or distributing

00:18:24.840 --> 00:18:31.120
Fonovisa's works, Cherry was not liable
for direct copyright infringement.

00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:37.120
But if the facts were as Fonovisa
alleged, then some of the vendors

00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:40.560
were surely violating
Section 1063 and were not

00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:46.360
shielded by the first sale doctrine
embodied in section 109(a).

00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:49.970
If the reasons why the vendors were
engaged in copyright infringement

00:18:49.970 --> 00:18:52.200
are not clear to you,
you should pause here

00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:57.370
to review the first segment
of lecture number eight.

00:18:57.370 --> 00:19:02.650
Fonovisa contended that Cherry Auction
was secondarily liable for the vendors'

00:19:02.650 --> 00:19:07.100
unlawful behavior, both under the
doctrine of contributory infringement

00:19:07.100 --> 00:19:10.600
and under the doctrine of
vicarious infringement.

00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:13.460
The trial court was unpersuaded
and dismissed the suit for failure

00:19:13.460 --> 00:19:17.060
to state a claim upon which
relief could be granted.

00:19:17.060 --> 00:19:22.240
The Court of Appeals for the Ninth
Circuit reversed and remanded the case.

00:19:22.240 --> 00:19:26.440
In the opinion explaining its
decision, the Ninth Circuit clarified

00:19:26.440 --> 00:19:32.320
and arguably expanded both
secondary liability doctrines.

00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:34.660
With respect to
contributory infringement,

00:19:34.660 --> 00:19:38.910
the court ruled that Fonovisa had
sufficiently alleged knowledge

00:19:38.910 --> 00:19:42.060
of the infringing sales on
the part of Cherry Auction.

00:19:42.060 --> 00:19:44.850
More importantly and
controversially, the court

00:19:44.850 --> 00:19:48.200
ruled that quote material
contribution close

00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:52.510
quote of the sort required by the
doctrine of contributory infringement

00:19:52.510 --> 00:19:56.880
could be established by showing that
the defendant quote provided the site

00:19:56.880 --> 00:20:03.890
and facilities for known
infringing activity close quote.

00:20:03.890 --> 00:20:07.470
With respect to vicarious
infringement, the Ninth Circuit

00:20:07.470 --> 00:20:11.680
ruled that Cherry Auction
controlled the flea market site

00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:15.080
and had unconstrained
authority to expel any vendor.

00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:16.950
It, thus, plainly had
the right and ability

00:20:16.950 --> 00:20:20.110
to supervise the infringing activity.

00:20:20.110 --> 00:20:22.670
More importantly and
controversially, the court

00:20:22.670 --> 00:20:26.130
ruled that the quote
financial interest required

00:20:26.130 --> 00:20:29.820
to establish vicarious
liability could be established

00:20:29.820 --> 00:20:33.360
by showing that the infringing
behavior quote enhanced

00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:38.010
the attractiveness of the defendant's
venue to potential customers

00:20:38.010 --> 00:20:38.900
close quote.

00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:42.940
In other words, that the
infringing conduct acted as a draw,

00:20:42.940 --> 00:20:46.150
pulling customers toward
the defendant's site

00:20:46.150 --> 00:20:50.550
and thus enabling the
defendant to earn more money.

00:20:50.550 --> 00:20:53.860
It should be apparent that this
is an expansive interpretation.

00:20:53.860 --> 00:20:58.040
Taken literally, it would
encompass many kinds of behavior

00:20:58.040 --> 00:21:00.640
in which the financial
benefit to the defendant

00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:06.701
is more indirect than the sort
enjoyed by the dance hall owners.

00:21:06.701 --> 00:21:08.950
This concludes our examination
of the basic principles

00:21:08.950 --> 00:21:10.830
of secondary liability.

00:21:10.830 --> 00:21:14.160
After the break, we'll
examine a set of recent cases

00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:17.910
that have applied or modified
those principles in context

00:21:17.910 --> 00:21:21.210
in which defendants supplied goods
or services that are sometimes

00:21:21.210 --> 00:21:24.670
used for infringing
purposes and sometimes

00:21:24.670 --> 00:21:26.810
for non-infringement purposes.

00:21:26.810 --> 00:21:27.382
