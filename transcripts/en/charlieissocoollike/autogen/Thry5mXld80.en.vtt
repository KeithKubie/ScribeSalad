say that I decide to eat the last cookie

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299
say that I decide to eat the last cookie
 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.120
say that I decide to eat the last cookie
and it's so bloody delicious that by the

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130
and it's so bloody delicious that by the
 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.039
and it's so bloody delicious that by the
time I'm done I decide to go back in

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049
time I'm done I decide to go back in
 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:56.550
time I'm done I decide to go back in
time and eat the last cookie again

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:56.560
 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.870
however my decision to go back in time

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880
however my decision to go back in time
 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:00.700
however my decision to go back in time
was based on me being able to eat the

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:00.710
was based on me being able to eat the
 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:02.559
was based on me being able to eat the
last cookie in the first place and so

00:02:02.559 --> 00:02:02.569
last cookie in the first place and so
 

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:04.209
last cookie in the first place and so
now that future me is eatin the cookie

00:02:04.209 --> 00:02:04.219
now that future me is eatin the cookie
 

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:06.069
now that future me is eatin the cookie
before past me has had a chance to I've

before past me has had a chance to I've
changed the course of history and

00:02:07.599 --> 00:02:07.609

imagine that this time I come home and
find to my surprise a brand new batch of

find to my surprise a brand new batch of
 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:30.069
find to my surprise a brand new batch of
delicious cookies and I eat them all by

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:30.079
delicious cookies and I eat them all by
 

00:02:30.079 --> 00:02:32.949
delicious cookies and I eat them all by
myself once I'm done I naturally want

00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:32.959
myself once I'm done I naturally want
 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:34.750
myself once I'm done I naturally want
some more and so I decide to beg my own

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760
some more and so I decide to beg my own
 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.339
some more and so I decide to beg my own
but once I've made them I become

00:02:36.339 --> 00:02:36.349
but once I've made them I become
 

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:38.259
but once I've made them I become
confused as to who made the original

00:02:38.259 --> 00:02:38.269
confused as to who made the original
 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:40.900
confused as to who made the original
cookies in the first place and then I

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:40.910
cookies in the first place and then I
 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:42.789
cookies in the first place and then I
realized that the cookies I've just made

00:02:42.789 --> 00:02:42.799
realized that the cookies I've just made
 

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:45.100
realized that the cookies I've just made
are identical to the ones I ate once I

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.110
are identical to the ones I ate once I
 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:49.660
are identical to the ones I ate once I
got home and so I go back in time and

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670
got home and so I go back in time and
 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:51.309
got home and so I go back in time and
place the cookies where I originally

00:02:51.309 --> 00:02:51.319
place the cookies where I originally
 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:52.990
place the cookies where I originally
found them ready for the past version of

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.000
found them ready for the past version of
 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.599
found them ready for the past version of
me to enjoy oh yay cookies so even

00:02:58.599 --> 00:02:58.609
me to enjoy oh yay cookies so even

me to enjoy oh yay cookies so even
though there is still time travel

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780
though there is still time travel
 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:01.240
though there is still time travel
involved the timeline is completely

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250
involved the timeline is completely
 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:03.039
involved the timeline is completely
consistent with itself and so there are

00:03:03.039 --> 00:03:03.049
consistent with itself and so there are
 

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:05.170
consistent with itself and so there are
no paradoxes but as interesting as

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.180
no paradoxes but as interesting as
 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:06.940
no paradoxes but as interesting as
time-travel is in a fictional sense in

time-travel is in a fictional sense in
 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:08.890
time-travel is in a fictional sense in
my view it becomes much more interesting

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:08.900
my view it becomes much more interesting
 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:10.000
my view it becomes much more interesting
when you find out about the fact that

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010
when you find out about the fact that
 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:12.789
when you find out about the fact that
theoretically it's actually possible if

00:03:12.789 --> 00:03:12.799
theoretically it's actually possible if
 

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:14.020
theoretically it's actually possible if
you've experienced as much science

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.030
you've experienced as much science
 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:15.610
you've experienced as much science

different bits of space-time are pressed

00:03:40.539 --> 00:03:40.549
different bits of space-time are pressed
 

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:42.339
different bits of space-time are pressed
together the point at which these two

00:03:42.339 --> 00:03:42.349
together the point at which these two
 

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:44.680
together the point at which these two
different bits of space-time meet is a

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:44.690
different bits of space-time meet is a
 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:48.039
different bits of space-time meet is a
wormhole this is a wormhole the only

00:03:48.039 --> 00:03:48.049
wormhole this is a wormhole the only
 

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:49.629
wormhole this is a wormhole the only
slight problem is that in order for

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:49.639
slight problem is that in order for
 

00:03:49.639 --> 00:03:50.890
slight problem is that in order for
someone to be able to go through a

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:50.900
someone to be able to go through a
 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:52.930
someone to be able to go through a
wormhole to travel from one point in

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:52.940
wormhole to travel from one point in
 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:55.119
wormhole to travel from one point in
space-time to another we would need an

00:03:55.119 --> 00:03:55.129
space-time to another we would need an
 

00:03:55.129 --> 00:03:57.390
space-time to another we would need an
amount of energy comparable to a star

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:57.400
amount of energy comparable to a star
 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:00.250
amount of energy comparable to a star
exploding which is quite a lot of energy

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:00.260
exploding which is quite a lot of energy
 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.319
exploding which is quite a lot of energy
but it is still allowed by the laws of

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:02.329
but it is still allowed by the laws of
 

00:04:02.329 --> 00:04:03.670
but it is still allowed by the laws of
physics there is currently no rule

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:03.680
physics there is currently no rule
 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:05.289

saying that we could not time travel

00:04:05.289 --> 00:04:05.299
saying that we could not time travel
 

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:08.800
saying that we could not time travel
time travel is not impossible it's just

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:08.810
time travel is not impossible it's just
 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:09.400
time travel is not impossible it's just
very

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:09.410
very
 

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:11.470
very
very improbable I will leave you with

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:11.480
very improbable I will leave you with
 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:13.180
very improbable I will leave you with

yeah it didn't subscribe actually you
think they couldn't get another bit of

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:26.780
think they couldn't get another bit of
 

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:30.820
think they couldn't get another bit of
this but apparently it's disgusting
