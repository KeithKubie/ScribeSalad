00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.167
- [Voiceover] What I would like us to do

00:00:02.167 --> 00:00:06.066
in this video is find the
power series representation

00:00:06.066 --> 00:00:10.589
of or find the power series
approximitation (chuckles)

00:00:10.589 --> 00:00:13.933
the power series
approximation of arctangent

00:00:13.933 --> 00:00:16.900
of two x centered at zero

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:20.633
and let's just say we want
the first four nonzero terms

00:00:20.633 --> 00:00:24.466
of the power series
approximation of arctangent

00:00:24.466 --> 00:00:26.100
of two x centered at zero

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:29.233
so it's essentially the
Maclaurin Series of arctangent

00:00:29.233 --> 00:00:32.266
of two x, the first four
nonzero terms of it.

00:00:32.266 --> 00:00:34.066
If you feel good about it,

00:00:34.066 --> 00:00:35.433
I encourage you to pause the video

00:00:35.433 --> 00:00:37.117
and try to work through it yourself.

00:00:38.163 --> 00:00:40.700
You might have tried to work through it

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.433
and you've probably took the first

00:00:42.433 --> 00:00:43.433
derivative of it.

00:00:43.433 --> 00:00:45.633
You probably saw that hey, the derivative

00:00:45.633 --> 00:00:49.566
with respect to x of arctangent

00:00:49.566 --> 00:00:54.266
of two x is equal to
and this is a refresher

00:00:54.266 --> 00:00:55.800
if you didn't realize it the first time.

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.233
It's going to be the
derivative of arctangent of x

00:00:58.233 --> 00:01:01.100
is one over one plus x squared

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.440
so this is going to be

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:05.600
the derivative of this which is two

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.400
over one plus this whole thing squared.

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:14.400
One plus, I would say
one plus four x squared

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.400
and then as you tried to
find more of the terms

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:19.866
of the Maclaurin Series,

00:01:19.866 --> 00:01:22.000
you would have taken
more derivatives of this

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.833
and it would have gotten very hairy,

00:01:23.833 --> 00:01:25.700
very fast if especially if you're looking

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.366
for the first four nonzero terms.

00:01:28.366 --> 00:01:29.766
You probably realize hey,

00:01:29.766 --> 00:01:31.400
there must be some type of an insight

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.700
that I hadn't fully appreciated yet

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.166
when I just tried to just power through

00:01:36.166 --> 00:01:38.866
or no pun intended, power through

00:01:38.866 --> 00:01:40.333
finding the power series,

00:01:40.333 --> 00:01:42.542
the first four nonzero
terms of the power series

00:01:42.542 --> 00:01:45.133
centered zero of arc tangent of two x.

00:01:45.133 --> 00:01:47.900
You are right, there
is a key insight here.

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:50.100
The key insight here is well,

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.266
instead of doing it directly,

00:01:52.266 --> 00:01:54.233
let's see if we could
find the power series

00:01:54.233 --> 00:01:57.500
representation, the first
four terms of this thing

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.133
right over here and then we
can take the antiderivative

00:02:01.133 --> 00:02:02.800
of that to find the power series

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:04.548
of arctangent of two x making sure

00:02:04.548 --> 00:02:05.900
that we get the constant right

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:09.000
that it satisfies the fact
that we are being centered

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.009
at zero, so I know what
you're thinking now.

00:02:12.009 --> 00:02:13.800
Well that seems like it's getting us

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.159
to the exact same issue.

00:02:15.159 --> 00:02:18.133
If I want to find the power
series representation of this,

00:02:18.133 --> 00:02:19.266
the first four terms of it,

00:02:19.266 --> 00:02:21.000
I'm still having to take
the derivative of this

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.333
multiple times it seems just as hard

00:02:23.333 --> 00:02:26.200
but this is the key insight
I guess you could say.

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.263
The key insight is let's just say f of x

00:02:30.124 --> 00:02:31.642
which of course is the derivative

00:02:31.642 --> 00:02:32.966
of arctangent of two x

00:02:32.966 --> 00:02:35.400
is two over one

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.033
plus four x squared.

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:42.953
Now, if we had another function

00:02:42.953 --> 00:02:44.467
that cleans it up a little bit

00:02:44.467 --> 00:02:45.933
so that we don't get all these hairiness

00:02:45.933 --> 00:02:48.100
when we take the derivatives.

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:50.466
Let's say we had another function g of x,

00:02:50.466 --> 00:02:52.300
I'm using the color that I have not used.

00:02:53.192 --> 00:02:56.133
Let's say, that I have g of x

00:02:56.133 --> 00:03:00.033
is equal to one over one plus x.

00:03:00.033 --> 00:03:02.800
This is an interesting thing
because it's really easy

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:06.623
and this is the same thing as one plus x

00:03:06.623 --> 00:03:08.300
to the negative one power.

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:11.166
g of x is interesting
because it's really easy

00:03:11.166 --> 00:03:13.633
to take its derivatives.

00:03:13.633 --> 00:03:15.866
For example, g prime of x

00:03:15.866 --> 00:03:18.333
is going to be equal to chain rule

00:03:18.333 --> 00:03:19.866
derivative one plus x is just one

00:03:19.866 --> 00:03:22.800
so it's going to be equal
to negative one plus x

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.333
to the negative two power

00:03:24.333 --> 00:03:26.100
if I want to take the
second derivative of that.

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:28.756
g prime prime of x that's
going to be negative two

00:03:28.756 --> 00:03:31.617
times negative one it's
two times one plus x

00:03:31.617 --> 00:03:33.566
to the negative three power.

00:03:33.566 --> 00:03:37.994
If I want to take the
third derivative of that,

00:03:37.994 --> 00:03:39.500
that's going to be, let's see.

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:41.566
Negative three times two its negative six

00:03:41.566 --> 00:03:44.700
times one plus x to the
negative four power.

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:45.633
I know you're saying, "Sal,

00:03:45.633 --> 00:03:47.133
"aren't we worried about this?

00:03:47.133 --> 00:03:47.933
"Why are you doing this?"

00:03:47.933 --> 00:03:49.666
Well just bare with me for a second.

00:03:49.666 --> 00:03:51.600
Just said quickly, I was able to find

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:53.966
the first three derivatives of g of x

00:03:53.966 --> 00:03:57.133
and it's very easy then to
find the first four terms

00:03:57.133 --> 00:03:58.900
of its power series representation

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:00.066
especially it's Maclaurin,

00:04:00.066 --> 00:04:01.433
that's Maclaurin series

00:04:01.433 --> 00:04:03.489
if the power series centered at zero.

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:05.400
We just have to evaluate
each of these at zero.

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.933
g of zero is equal to one,

00:04:08.933 --> 00:04:10.966
g prime of zero

00:04:11.889 --> 00:04:13.920
is equal to negative one.

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:16.300
g prime, prime of zero,

00:04:17.546 --> 00:04:19.215
so one plus zero and
then the negative three,

00:04:19.215 --> 00:04:21.200
that's just one times two is equal to two

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:25.566
and then the third
derivative evaluated at zero

00:04:25.566 --> 00:04:27.966
is equal to negative six.

00:04:27.966 --> 00:04:31.017
I could write the g of x

00:04:32.678 --> 00:04:34.261
is approximately equal,

00:04:34.261 --> 00:04:36.200
so I'm just going to do
the first four terms here

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:39.133
is going to be g of zero which is one

00:04:39.133 --> 00:04:41.966
minus g prime of zero times x.

00:04:41.966 --> 00:04:45.633
That's minus one times
x, so that's negative x

00:04:47.817 --> 00:04:50.800
plus g prime, prime of zero

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:54.900
two over two factorial times x squared.

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:56.766
Well this is just one times x squared

00:04:56.766 --> 00:04:58.066
so let me just write that.

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:03.323
That's just going to be plus x squared

00:05:03.323 --> 00:05:08.250
and then we have plus g
prime, prime, prime of zero

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:10.833
which is negative six over three factorial

00:05:10.833 --> 00:05:12.242
times x to the third.

00:05:12.242 --> 00:05:14.133
Well three factorials are six

00:05:14.133 --> 00:05:16.466
so negative six divided by
six is just negative one.

00:05:16.466 --> 00:05:19.300
That's going to be
negative x to the third,

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:24.100
negative x to the third and
I know what you're thinking.

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:26.167
"All right Sal, so you just
started with a hard problem

00:05:26.167 --> 00:05:27.733
"and you gave yourself
a much easier problem

00:05:27.733 --> 00:05:29.666
"to find the power series representation.

00:05:29.666 --> 00:05:30.907
"How is this useful?"

00:05:30.907 --> 00:05:33.466
Well this is the key insight
that I've been promising

00:05:33.466 --> 00:05:35.133
throughout this video so far.

00:05:35.133 --> 00:05:39.600
The key insight, the
long promised key insight

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:42.800
is that and I'm finding a
suitable color for a key insight

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:44.866
is that we can write f of x.

00:05:44.866 --> 00:05:48.166
Notice f of x is just two times,

00:05:48.166 --> 00:05:51.100
f of x is two times

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:54.867
g of four x squared.

00:05:54.867 --> 00:05:58.666
Notice you replace your
x's with a four x squared.

00:05:58.666 --> 00:06:00.942
You're going to have one
over one plus four x squared

00:06:00.942 --> 00:06:02.767
and then you multiply that
whole thing times two,

00:06:02.767 --> 00:06:04.600
you get this thing right over here.

00:06:06.245 --> 00:06:07.733
If f of x is equal to that

00:06:07.733 --> 00:06:10.200
then f of x is power series representation

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:13.166
its just going to be
taking this power series

00:06:13.166 --> 00:06:14.800
or at least the first four terms of it

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:17.366
and replacing the x's with four x squares

00:06:17.366 --> 00:06:19.767
and then multiplying the
whole thing times two,

00:06:19.767 --> 00:06:21.100
so let's do that.

00:06:21.776 --> 00:06:24.527
We can write

00:06:24.527 --> 00:06:25.900
that f of x,

00:06:26.684 --> 00:06:28.666
so we could write the f of x

00:06:30.373 --> 00:06:32.500
is going to be approximately equal to

00:06:33.669 --> 00:06:36.733
two times this thing,

00:06:36.733 --> 00:06:39.573
a value when x is equal to four x squared.

00:06:39.573 --> 00:06:43.800
It is one minus instead of an x,

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:46.233
I'm going to write a four x squared

00:06:46.233 --> 00:06:48.659
plus x squared but instead of an x,

00:06:48.659 --> 00:06:50.767
I have a four x squared squared.

00:06:50.767 --> 00:06:54.433
This is plus four x squared squared.

00:06:54.433 --> 00:06:56.966
Well that's going to
be 16 x to the fourth,

00:06:56.966 --> 00:06:57.966
so let me just write that,

00:06:57.966 --> 00:07:02.400
that's going to be plus 16 x to the fourth

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:04.100
and finally minus x to the third

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:05.733
but now an x is four x squared

00:07:05.733 --> 00:07:09.833
so it's minus four x
squared to the third power.

00:07:09.833 --> 00:07:12.966
Well that's going to be 64 x to the sixth.

00:07:12.966 --> 00:07:17.099
Let me write that, minus 64

00:07:17.099 --> 00:07:18.966
x to the sixth power

00:07:18.966 --> 00:07:21.302
and then we could say
that this is going to be

00:07:21.302 --> 00:07:23.200
so f of x is approximately equal to,

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:28.100
distribute the two, two
minus eight x squared

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:31.100
plus 32 x to the fourth

00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:34.533
minus 128 x to the sixth.

00:07:34.533 --> 00:07:37.500
Just like that with a little
bit of a substitution,

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:40.900
I was able to reasonably
a non hairy fashion

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:43.500
find the first four nonzero terms

00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:47.767
of the power series of two
over one plus four x squared

00:07:47.767 --> 00:07:49.633
which is the derivative,

00:07:49.633 --> 00:07:51.300
which is going to be the derivative

00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:55.200
of the power series of arctangent

00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:57.100
of two x.

00:07:57.100 --> 00:07:59.500
Let's write this down,
so I'm going to write,

00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:01.300
I'm going to write down,

00:08:02.023 --> 00:08:04.200
so arctangent of two x,

00:08:05.430 --> 00:08:09.356
arctangent of two x

00:08:09.925 --> 00:08:12.633
which is equal to an antiderivative

00:08:12.633 --> 00:08:15.266
of f of x,

00:08:16.896 --> 00:08:21.033
dx which is going to be
equal to an antiderivative

00:08:21.033 --> 00:08:22.800
of this whole, all of this business.

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:27.667
It's the antiderivative
of two minus eight,

00:08:27.667 --> 00:08:31.533
minus eight x squared plus 32

00:08:31.533 --> 00:08:34.833
x to the fourth minus 128

00:08:34.833 --> 00:08:36.466
x to the sixth.

00:08:36.466 --> 00:08:38.933
Actually let me make this approximate

00:08:38.933 --> 00:08:42.033
because now of course
we're doing approximation

00:08:42.033 --> 00:08:43.367
with the power series.

00:08:43.367 --> 00:08:46.533
Dx and what is this going to be equal to?

00:08:46.533 --> 00:08:50.766
We get approximately equal to

00:08:50.766 --> 00:08:52.900
well I'm going to have a constant there.

00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:53.966
Let me write the constant first

00:08:53.966 --> 00:08:56.233
because when we write our power
series or Maclaurin Series,

00:08:56.233 --> 00:08:58.000
the first term is the constant term.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.833
It's our function evaluated to add zero.

00:09:00.833 --> 00:09:02.066
We're going to have a constant,

00:09:02.066 --> 00:09:03.666
if I take the antiderivative of two,

00:09:03.666 --> 00:09:07.233
that's going to be plus two x.

00:09:07.233 --> 00:09:10.266
The antiderivative of this,
let's see, x to the third

00:09:10.266 --> 00:09:11.656
divide eight by three

00:09:11.656 --> 00:09:16.103
so it's negative 8/3 x to the third power

00:09:16.103 --> 00:09:21.103
then plus 32 x to the fifth

00:09:21.127 --> 00:09:23.100
over five

00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:27.833
minus 128 x to the seventh

00:09:27.833 --> 00:09:30.400
over seven.

00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:32.166
We're in the home stretch.

00:09:32.166 --> 00:09:34.866
We've got at least four nonzero terms,

00:09:34.866 --> 00:09:35.900
if this is nonzero

00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:37.666
there's going to be five nonzero terms

00:09:37.666 --> 00:09:38.900
but now let's just make sure

00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:41.166
that our constant is
appropriate for arctangent

00:09:41.166 --> 00:09:42.133
of two x.

00:09:42.133 --> 00:09:44.800
This is essentially
evaluate to what arctangent

00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:49.766
of when this function,
when x is equal to zero.

00:09:49.766 --> 00:09:52.400
What is arctangent of zero?

00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:54.700
Remember this is centered at zero

00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:56.166
so we better get it right there.

00:09:56.166 --> 00:09:58.233
That's just the most basic thing

00:09:58.233 --> 00:10:00.600
if we're doing the Maclaurin
Series representation.

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:01.833
We're centering at zero

00:10:01.833 --> 00:10:05.766
so our approximation evaluated zero

00:10:05.766 --> 00:10:08.200
better be the same thing as
a function of evaluated zero.

00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:11.000
Well arctangent of two times zero

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:12.633
is just going to be zero

00:10:12.633 --> 00:10:15.833
and so this thing when
you evaluate it at zero,

00:10:15.833 --> 00:10:18.166
this gets to C, so this gets to C

00:10:18.166 --> 00:10:20.300
must be equal to zero.

00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:25.133
C must be equal to zero if
we want this thing to be zero

00:10:25.133 --> 00:10:26.700
when X is equal to zero.

00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:29.000
Just like that we're done.

00:10:29.783 --> 00:10:32.496
We've been able to figure
out that arctangent

00:10:32.496 --> 00:10:33.953
of two x

00:10:34.645 --> 00:10:36.667
is approximately equal to

00:10:37.251 --> 00:10:41.866
two x minus 8/3 x to the third power

00:10:41.866 --> 00:10:45.866
plus 32 over five x to the fifth

00:10:45.866 --> 00:10:50.800
minus 128 over seven x to the seven.

00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:51.933
If we wanted more terms,

00:10:51.933 --> 00:10:53.566
we could have gotten more terms

00:10:53.566 --> 00:10:55.233
by just doing what we just did

00:10:55.233 --> 00:10:57.066
but doing it for more terms.

00:10:57.066 --> 00:11:01.267
Hopefully you enjoyed
that fairly hairy problem

00:11:01.267 --> 00:11:03.533
but as you saw it's not
as hairy as we thought

00:11:03.533 --> 00:11:04.600
it was going to be.
