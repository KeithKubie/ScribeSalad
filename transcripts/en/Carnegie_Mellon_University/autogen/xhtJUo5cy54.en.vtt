at all the only thing that's been
 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.030
at all the only thing that's been
changing is the image is sort of in flux

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040
changing is the image is sort of in flux
 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.150
changing is the image is sort of in flux
again depending on how things work and

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:10.160
again depending on how things work and
 

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:12.199

that kind of thing which we're testing

00:00:12.199 --> 00:00:12.209
that kind of thing which we're testing
 

00:00:12.209 --> 00:00:14.060
that kind of thing which we're testing
right now we've been testing the lights

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070
right now we've been testing the lights
 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:15.829
right now we've been testing the lights
we're trying to figure out exactly what

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839
we're trying to figure out exactly what
 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.779
we're trying to figure out exactly what
we want them to do in response to the

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789
we want them to do in response to the
 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:20.689
we want them to do in response to the
heart rate we are using a heart rate

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699
heart rate we are using a heart rate
 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.880
heart rate we are using a heart rate
sensor rather with a microphone that

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890
sensor rather with a microphone that
 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.640
sensor rather with a microphone that
will be housed on the back of the brooch

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650
will be housed on the back of the brooch
 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.220
will be housed on the back of the brooch
which will be on the inside of the top

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230
which will be on the inside of the top
 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:34.760

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770
the bodice as someone who does costume
 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.040
the bodice as someone who does costume
production it is a very collaborative

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050
production it is a very collaborative
 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.870
production it is a very collaborative
process all the time so I'm always

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:38.880
process all the time so I'm always
 

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:40.910
process all the time so I'm always
working with a designer and other makers

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920
working with a designer and other makers
 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.030
working with a designer and other makers
you know we divide things up into

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:43.040
you know we divide things up into
 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.290
you know we divide things up into
specialties so that you can accomplish

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300
specialties so that you can accomplish
 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.780
specialties so that you can accomplish
something in the best way possible so

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:47.790
something in the best way possible so
 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:50.450
something in the best way possible so
this is a very familiar scenario to me

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460
this is a very familiar scenario to me
 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.640
this is a very familiar scenario to me
but it's also even more exciting because

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:52.650
but it's also even more exciting because
 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:54.830
but it's also even more exciting because
it's such different specialties working

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840
it's such different specialties working
 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.790
it's such different specialties working
together to create something new this is

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800
together to create something new this is
 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.550
together to create something new this is
the computer-generated image of the

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:01.560
the computer-generated image of the
 

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:03.140
the computer-generated image of the
graph that we're working with that will

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:03.150
graph that we're working with that will
 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:06.260
graph that we're working with that will
be put on to the actual dress and we

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270
be put on to the actual dress and we
 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:07.940
be put on to the actual dress and we
print it out so that we can actually lay

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950
print it out so that we can actually lay
 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.430
print it out so that we can actually lay
it down on the real-life patterns for

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:10.440
it down on the real-life patterns for
 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:12.200
it down on the real-life patterns for
the skirt and then kind of like measure

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210
the skirt and then kind of like measure
 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.390
the skirt and then kind of like measure
what the distance is between things

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:16.400
what the distance is between things
 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.860
what the distance is between things
david is sort of like our software

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:18.870
david is sort of like our software
 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:21.350
david is sort of like our software
engineer graphic designer in working on

engineer graphic designer in working on
this image so we can go back and forth

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400
this image so we can go back and forth
 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.760
this image so we can go back and forth
with him for example I'll like show him

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770
with him for example I'll like show him
 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.140
with him for example I'll like show him
on the floor this is what my pattern

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150
on the floor this is what my pattern
 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.730
on the floor this is what my pattern
looks like and this is what that picture

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740
looks like and this is what that picture
 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.350
looks like and this is what that picture
looks like printed on it and I want to

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360
looks like printed on it and I want to
 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.790
looks like printed on it and I want to
tilt it like this and we have to divide

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:31.800
tilt it like this and we have to divide
 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.860
tilt it like this and we have to divide
it here and usually okay let's figure

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:33.870
it here and usually okay let's figure
 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:35.360
it here and usually okay let's figure
out how to do that and we measure and

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:35.370
out how to do that and we measure and
 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:37.010
out how to do that and we measure and
kind of put it in so these are the

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020
kind of put it in so these are the
 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.560
kind of put it in so these are the
clusters is one of the colleges the size

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570
clusters is one of the colleges the size
 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.090
clusters is one of the colleges the size
of the cluster is sort of the population

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100
of the cluster is sort of the population
 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.250
of the cluster is sort of the population
of the college and then the line

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:45.260
of the college and then the line
 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.840
of the college and then the line
connecting two clusters represent how

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850
connecting two clusters represent how
 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.730
connecting two clusters represent how
many credit hours students in these

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740
many credit hours students in these
 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.800
many credit hours students in these
colleges take in the other college and

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810
colleges take in the other college and
 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.930
colleges take in the other college and
so the sort of the thickness of this

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:53.940
so the sort of the thickness of this
 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:02:02.070
so the sort of the thickness of this
group of lines here means more credit

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:02.080
 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.710
up alright David we have to do some

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:04.720
up alright David we have to do some
 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:10.770
up alright David we have to do some
changes it's too fragile and here see

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:10.780
changes it's too fragile and here see
 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:12.960
changes it's too fragile and here see
how it like already it's too thin

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970
how it like already it's too thin
 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:14.850
how it like already it's too thin
especially because this is even stiffer

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860
especially because this is even stiffer
 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.820
especially because this is even stiffer
fabric than what we'll be using I think

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830
fabric than what we'll be using I think
 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:20.160
fabric than what we'll be using I think
this was really beautiful if you could

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170
this was really beautiful if you could
 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.260
this was really beautiful if you could
keep it straight to do that because then

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:22.270
keep it straight to do that because then
 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:24.680
keep it straight to do that because then
even here I can poke through you know

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690
even here I can poke through you know
 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:30.540
even here I can poke through you know
okay what we didn't expect was that all

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:30.550
okay what we didn't expect was that all
 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:31.800
okay what we didn't expect was that all
these lines are so close together that

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810
these lines are so close together that
 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:33.540
these lines are so close together that
when the laser cutter cuts them out

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:33.550
when the laser cutter cuts them out
 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:35.100
when the laser cutter cuts them out
there's so little fabric left in between

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110
there's so little fabric left in between
 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:39.540
there's so little fabric left in between
but it just tears and so we're trying to

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:39.550
but it just tears and so we're trying to
 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:40.650
but it just tears and so we're trying to
figure out the best way to deal with

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:40.660
figure out the best way to deal with
 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:42.199
figure out the best way to deal with
that so for example I could grab these

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:42.209
that so for example I could grab these
 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:45.810
that so for example I could grab these
and just make them all much thinner so

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:45.820
and just make them all much thinner so
 

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:47.610
and just make them all much thinner so
there's less fabric missing so the whole

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620
there's less fabric missing so the whole
 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:49.199
there's less fabric missing so the whole
thing is sort of structurally more sound

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:49.209
thing is sort of structurally more sound
 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:54.060
thing is sort of structurally more sound
or we could go through and just have you

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:54.070
or we could go through and just have you
 

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:55.680
or we could go through and just have you
know half as many lines which you know

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690
know half as many lines which you know
 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:57.780
know half as many lines which you know
also results in less fabric getting cut

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790
also results in less fabric getting cut
 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:59.760
also results in less fabric getting cut
out we're just trying to decide what's

00:02:59.760 --> 00:02:59.770
out we're just trying to decide what's
 

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:02.010
out we're just trying to decide what's
going to look the best so right now the

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:02.020
going to look the best so right now the
 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:03.630
going to look the best so right now the
thickest point in the center of the line

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:03.640
thickest point in the center of the line
 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:06.180
thickest point in the center of the line
is ten units across so if I make it like

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.190
is ten units across so if I make it like
 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:10.790
is ten units across so if I make it like
a three

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:10.800
 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:17.220
we could go thinner once we can get the

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230
we could go thinner once we can get the
 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:18.840
we could go thinner once we can get the
skirt cut out I can actually start like

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:18.850
skirt cut out I can actually start like
 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:21.600
skirt cut out I can actually start like
putting the skirt together there will be

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:21.610
putting the skirt together there will be
 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:24.120
putting the skirt together there will be
things we have to kind of figure out as

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:24.130
things we have to kind of figure out as
 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:26.009
things we have to kind of figure out as
we keep experimenting with that and then

00:03:26.009 --> 00:03:26.019
we keep experimenting with that and then
 

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:27.990
we keep experimenting with that and then
as we start to house it into the garment

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.000
as we start to house it into the garment
 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.650
as we start to house it into the garment
how everything hooks up how it is in

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:31.660
how everything hooks up how it is in
 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:33.570
how everything hooks up how it is in
there so that it's an easy way to deal

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:33.580
there so that it's an easy way to deal
 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:35.820
there so that it's an easy way to deal
with it switches and those kinds of

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:35.830
with it switches and those kinds of
 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:40.500
with it switches and those kinds of
things and all that so yeah
