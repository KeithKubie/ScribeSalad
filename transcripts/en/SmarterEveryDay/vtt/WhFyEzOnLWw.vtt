[party whistles]
Hey it's me Destin.

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:08.050
Welcome back to Smarter Every Day. A very special Smarter Every Day. The 100th episode, but not only that..

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:12.070
it kind of coincided with a million subscribers, so thank you very much for your

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.120
support and because of that you get to join the party with us. Here's your party hat.

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:20.140
So what we're gonna do today is we're gonna go through all 100 episodes of

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.190
Smarter Every Day and we're gonna look at clips from each individual episode and we're just gonna

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.220
reminisce together. What was the first Smarter Every Day you saw? What was your favourite

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:32.250
Smarter Every Day? What was your favourite Smarter Every Day?
- Cat dropping video.
- Obviously,

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:36.280
she has a cat. What was yours?
- The slingshots.
- And mine was the baby I think.

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.320
I don't know, it might have been Operation Rocket. So what we're gonna do is, leave me a comment, tell

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:44.330
me what was your favourite, what was the first one you ever saw, and then after we watch this video

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:48.380
together we're gonna go back and introduce you to three people

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:52.430
that you may or may not know that have been working behind the scenes on some pretty cool stuff.

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:56.460
So, join the party. Let's watch a video together.
[party whistle]
Let's go.

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.500
Hey it's me Destin. So ah, we don't have

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:04.510
really awesome accents and we don't have a lot of money, but we do know our guns

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.520
and we are rocket scientists. So we're gonna start a new web series

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.540
called Smarter Every Day.

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.560
You make a quick macro lens that also acts as a microscope. The reason they call it a trigger

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:20.580
fish is because you have to pull the trigger in order to get the dorsal fin to go down.

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.640
- The reason you have a carousel inside your microwave oven is cause that

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:28.670
beam always travels through the same path.
- Those who would give up essential liberty

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:32.680
to purchase a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety.

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.720
These are what pineapples look like when they're growing. This is one that's

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.750
not very mature. You can see the red leaves and things like that.

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.770
(Destin) Say, will you show us what this is?
- This is comb.
- Comb.

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.780
Yes.
- This one is loom.
- This is the loom.

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.810
Alright.

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:56.840
She's swapping. Hey this is the first tank. Or actually the first vehicle

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:00.870
to be called tank.
[cheering]

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:04.930
If they roll each on this rod on the inside, which.. [bang]

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.940
I decided I was going to learn the chemicals for

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:13.500
fireworks. Purple is a combination of strontium and copper so you get the red and the blue going together.

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:21.010
So the sound is simultaneously initiated from all points along the lightning bolt

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.050
at the same time.

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:28.570
So you can see the current spike. We've made a fire tornado. Let's check it out.

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:39.020
We've decided to change the format, make learning very very serious, and by serious I mean..

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.170
- Seriously awesome!
[cheering]

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:49.230
- Yes one hit.
- One hit.

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:53.240
That's amazing.
- T I A. [laughs]

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:57.310
- Which stands for?
- This.. is.. Africa.

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:01.320
[cheers] [rushing wind]

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:09.410
Notice it happens where it's rolling from the high pressure side to the low pressure side.

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:17.410
I know it's a rainbow but I made it, which makes it manly.

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:21.500
[laugh]

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:25.510
- Daddy are you OK?
- I'm OK.
- That looks weird.

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:29.550
But I like it. Bullet vs cow eye.

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:35.600
[music]

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:41.600
OK this morning we

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:45.610
used your frisbee as a plate to eat cassava and beans. What are we using it for today?

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:47.640
- Surgical prep.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.720
Hey it's me Destin. Welcome to Smarter Every Day.. NOPE!

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:05.740
- Welcome to the slingshot channel! [Intense German Laughter]

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:07.760
- Yes! [laughs]

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:11.790
[music]

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:17.810
Did you.. Did you just call me something?

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:19.980
- No.. [laughs]

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.900
- The inside of the stomach has hexagons on it. Wow.

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:29.930
- Rood.
- OK. Red balloon vs blue laser.

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:31.680
[pop]
 Easy.

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:34.020
[air escaping]

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.040
This is the very first time that this

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:44.120
kid's every seen a rocket in his entire life.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.440
Have a good one, we're going to have a baby. Bye.

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:02.270
He's alive and well and his lungs are working

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:06.340
and he's breathing air. Bullet blur is calculated by the velocity of the bullet as it exits

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:10.360
the weapon, multiplied times the flash duration. Do you eat this part?

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:12.370
Is this the nut?

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:18.420
[model helicopter engine]

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:30.500
- We're gonna apply force straight up here..

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:34.530
and it rotates 90 degrees.
(Destin) What do you know about gyroscopic procession?

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:38.590
Right, back, up and down.

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:42.650
This is so awesome I want to cry. No power at all.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.980
So today what I'm gonna do is start a playlist called the deep dive.

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:06.070
- Sunspots are magnetic storms on the sun.
(Destin) Oh that's awesome.
[slowed gunshot]

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:10.910
[cheer]

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:12.980
[laughing]

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:19.980
The top band is clearly accelerating slower than the bottom band.

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:27.050
These guys are working on the sun shield for the James Webb space telescope.

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:31.070
And what I think is so cool about this photo is that this guy in the bottom right corner

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:35.120
is my dad. And uh, yep, that's Machu Picchu.

00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:39.160
And of course, that's a llama. OK so what do you do

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:43.200
to hold a bird?
- Hold on tight and don't be scared.
- That's right.

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:47.230
[laughs]
- Go chase him. Let him go fly.

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:51.280
(Destin) The wing separates and the feathers turn so that the air is flowing

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:55.300
straight in between them. So I convinced Alan to do a self portrait with me.

00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:59.400
This self portrait would reveal more information than any of the other videos. Yeah I'm at

00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:03.410
YouTube headquarters here in San Bruno California.

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:07.430
[laughs]
 Get in an arc

00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:09.460
[firework explosion]

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:19.530
- I thought you'd come down enjoy taking a high res photo of Machu Picchu.

00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:21.570
- Sweet.

00:07:31.690 --> 00:07:35.690
- If the sound goes in this ear, not all the same frequencies

00:07:35.710 --> 00:07:37.730
are going to reach this ear.

00:07:48.790 --> 00:07:51.800
- 2.56 seconds later

00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:55.850
divided by two, 1.28 light seconds to the minute. Hey it's me Destin welcome to

00:07:55.870 --> 00:07:59.870
Iquitos Peru. It's a city of 400,000. We're working on a

00:07:59.890 --> 00:08:03.920
septic tank for an orphanage. We're gonna learn about how to use levers.

00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:07.950
Oohhoo hoo.. Wow. Oh are you serious.

00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:16.000
[laughs]

00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:18.440
Oh ghhhrr! You serious!

00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:25.070
This tiny spider has created debris that looks like a big spider.

00:08:32.140 --> 00:08:37.040
- It's called puddling. Basically they're drinking the minerals in the sand to get salt.

00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:44.180
(Destin) How you gonna get this worm down the hole?... ahh. Easy.

00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:48.220
Is it possible to wiggle in such a way that you're able to

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:52.250
rotate to a different angular position and then stop? On Smarter Every Day

00:08:52.270 --> 00:08:56.280
we demonstrated this with a high speed camera and a cat.
- OK well that's a great question.

00:08:56.300 --> 00:09:00.310
We don't have any cats on board, but we have a medical doctor

00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:04.370
who maybe can try to demonstrate.. Yeah next best thing to a cat.

00:09:04.390 --> 00:09:06.990
He can't change his angular momentum but he can change his body position.

00:09:07.010 --> 00:09:12.040
(Destin) The only meteorite ever to strike a person happened in 1954 in Alabama.

00:09:23.590 --> 00:09:28.590
(Destin) OK. What just happened?
- Skipped.

00:09:28.610 --> 00:09:30.640
- Yep. High five.

00:09:32.660 --> 00:09:36.670
There he is.
- Basically these are in sequence

00:09:36.690 --> 00:09:40.690
all the frames of the video.
(Destin) Dragonfly wings have something on them called the Pterostigma

00:09:40.710 --> 00:09:42.700
which is latin for wing mark.

00:09:52.780 --> 00:09:57.310
- So that's the actual pupa inside and then on the outside is the cocoon.

00:10:10.070 --> 00:10:12.860
(Destin) 3.. 2.. 1.. [gunshot]

00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:28.980
- Get him to rear up.
- Oh.. oh no.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.980
- Holy cow he's fast. I'm gonna put my hand down here where your pouch is

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:37.010
and we're just gonna see how this goes. Don't bite me. Just don't bite me.

00:10:37.030 --> 00:10:40.570
I cannot feel a pouch.

00:10:40.590 --> 00:10:45.120
Alright that was amazing. I really like looking back and seeing all the crazy stuff we've learned just by opening

00:10:45.140 --> 00:10:49.180
our eyes and looking at the world differently. It was amazing, thank you for being there.

00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:53.200
Be sure to tell me what your favourite part was. So, I told you there were three people that have been working

00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:57.250
behind the scenes on Smarter Every Day with very little to no recognition so I'm gonna do that now.

00:10:57.270 --> 00:11:01.270
The first person is a guy named Andrew Jackson. Not the president.

00:11:01.290 --> 00:11:05.280
To some people he is the most important component to even be able to understand what I'm saying on Smarter Every Day.

00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:09.360
I caught up with him in Australia. This is Andrew Jackson and you

00:11:09.380 --> 00:11:13.430
don't know who he is but he touches every Smarter Every Day video. Andrew volunteered

00:11:13.450 --> 00:11:17.460
to do the captioning on Smarter Every Day, and you've done it faithfully for how long?

00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:21.500
- Over a year.
- Over a year, and you don't even know that he does that.

00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:25.540
I wanted him to tell you why he does the captioning cause I think it's a pretty big deal.

00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:29.600
Can you tell me the story?
- Sure. So a friend of mine who I work with

00:11:29.620 --> 00:11:33.610
who's deaf, wanted to enjoy Destin's videos, and so I

00:11:33.630 --> 00:11:37.660
offered to do the captioning and forward that on to Destin so that she could watch them.

00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:41.710
And uh..
- What's her name?
- Her name's Ann.
- Ann, can we put a caption right here

00:11:41.730 --> 00:11:45.750
"Caption. Ann we're doing this for you" [laughs]

00:11:45.770 --> 00:11:49.800
- And so I figured that if I was doing it for one person then

00:11:49.820 --> 00:11:53.850
the power of the internet is that it can be for everyone.
- He's done this for free

00:11:53.870 --> 00:11:57.870
the whole time, it's a pretty big deal. And this is just, I wanted to let you know that there are

00:11:57.890 --> 00:12:01.930
many people that do things that you don't know about that make a world of difference.

00:12:01.950 --> 00:12:06.000
And for that I would like to give you a high five. [laugh] Thank you Andrew.

00:12:06.020 --> 00:12:10.020
- No worries.
- So one thing you might feel when you watch Smarter Every Day but not really

00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:14.060
think about is the music. Gordon McGladdery from A Shell in The Pit actually writes

00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:18.110
the music from Vancouver. I Skype with him at night, we talk all the time,

00:12:18.130 --> 00:12:22.140
but Gordon's been there since the beginning. Here's some video I caught of Gordon McGladdery in the

00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:24.980
rainforest of Peru when we finally got to meet face to face.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.240
[laugh]
(Destin) So who are you?
- I'm Gordon,

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:34.270
From Shell in The Pit.
- Alright, Gordon people might not know who you are

00:12:34.290 --> 00:12:38.320
and that they've been listening to your stuff for a couple of years.
- Yep.

00:12:38.340 --> 00:12:42.340
Um, well I do all the music for Smarter Every Day.

00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:46.360
Destin and I met online a year and a half or two years ago.

00:12:46.380 --> 00:12:50.380
- You make it sound like a dating website man, that's not how it was. [laugh]

00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:54.440
- I said hey I'm looking for a hot guy to write music for.
- That's not what happened at all.

00:12:54.460 --> 00:12:58.510
[laughs]
- And uh, so..

00:12:58.530 --> 00:13:02.550
we started making videos,

00:13:02.570 --> 00:13:06.590
and we just met I guess a week and a half ago in Lima Peru.

00:13:06.610 --> 00:13:10.620
Sound is 80% of what you see.
- What do you mean?

00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:14.670
- Um, I made that number up for starters.
[laugh]

00:13:14.690 --> 00:13:18.710
- One thing that has irritated me a long time about you is your insistence on having incredible facial hair

00:13:18.730 --> 00:13:22.750
and then I tried so hard, and this is

00:13:22.770 --> 00:13:26.770
all I got. It looks like some kind of child trying.
- I can't do it.

00:13:26.790 --> 00:13:30.800
Hater's gonna hate Destin. The music I've done for the series, we can

00:13:30.820 --> 00:13:38.860
find at my Bandcamp page. A Shell in The Pit, ashellinthepit.bandcamp.com, right?
- Right, I think so.

00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:42.870
- Amos are you really in my house?
- No. [laugh]

00:13:42.890 --> 00:13:46.920
- How.. You're.. You've.. You live in Michigan now. How are you

00:13:46.940 --> 00:13:50.950
in my house?
- Well I'm going to the Okra festival.

00:13:50.970 --> 00:13:54.960
- OK the last guy that's been working with Smarter Every Day for a while that you don't know about is Amos Kennedy.

00:13:54.980 --> 00:13:59.010
Amos is a printer, and he recently moved from

00:13:59.030 --> 00:14:03.040
Alabama to Detroit, and the idea is to teach other people how to print basically.

00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:07.080
- Correct.
- So Amos has authorised me to do 100 posters..

00:14:07.100 --> 00:14:11.090
- I am going to print 100 posters to celebrate the

00:14:11.110 --> 00:14:15.120
100th episode of Smarter Every Day

00:14:15.140 --> 00:14:19.140
and Destin is gonna figure out a way

00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:23.170
that that can generate funds for

00:14:23.190 --> 00:14:27.190
Smarter Every Day.
- OK so I can put these 100 posters

00:14:27.210 --> 00:14:31.200
on some type of bidding website and then that

00:14:31.220 --> 00:14:35.240
whatever the price gets up to, that's money that I can put back into Smarter Every Day.

00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:39.260
- Right. And all the posters are gonna be really bizarre.

00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:43.280
- Amos Kennedy. You're gonna see more of him once we figure out exactly how we're gonna do the posters.

00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:47.290
- If you don't see me you'll see the posters. [laugh]

00:14:47.310 --> 00:14:51.300
- OK. We're gonna try a real cat this time.

00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:55.320
Oh yeah.
- Yeah so I'm really excited

00:14:55.340 --> 00:14:59.370
to show you guys how these posters are made. Now I'll do that in a future episode but for now I think

00:14:59.390 --> 00:15:03.380
Amos seems like a wise man so I'll take his advice and I'll use these 100 episode

00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:07.390
celebration posters as a fundraiser so I'll leave a link in the video description, if you're interested in doing that

00:15:07.410 --> 00:15:11.410
and if you want to support Smarter Every Day you can do that however you choose.

00:15:11.430 --> 00:15:15.450
But, for now, thank you. I owe you a thank you. I mean 100 episodes

00:15:15.470 --> 00:15:19.480
that's pretty crazy for just a dad in Alabama just looking at the world differently. Not only that,

00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:23.520
a million subscribers, it's hard to imagine. Anyway you've offered me

00:15:23.540 --> 00:15:27.550
your time, your attention, your criticism and your encouragement.

00:15:27.570 --> 00:15:31.570
And thank you for that. Here's to 100 more episodes. I'll do my best. I am not perfect.

00:15:31.590 --> 00:15:35.590
I will try my best for you. Anyway, I'm Destin, you're getting Smarter Every Day.

00:15:35.610 --> 00:15:37.600
Have a good one.

00:15:43.660 --> 00:15:45.670
