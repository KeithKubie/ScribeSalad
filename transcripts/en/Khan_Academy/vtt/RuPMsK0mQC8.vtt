00:00:00.525 --> 00:00:02.605
Voiceover: Easily the most quoted number

00:00:02.605 --> 00:00:04.691
people give you when they're
publicizing information

00:00:04.691 --> 00:00:07.738
about their credit cards is the APR.

00:00:07.738 --> 00:00:09.691
I think you might guess
or you might already know

00:00:09.691 --> 00:00:12.941
that it stands for annual percentage rate.

00:00:17.971 --> 00:00:19.797
What I want to do in this
video is to understand

00:00:19.797 --> 00:00:22.197
a little bit more detail
in what they actually mean

00:00:22.197 --> 00:00:24.997
by the annual percentage
rate and do a little bit math

00:00:24.997 --> 00:00:28.329
to get the real or the
mathematically or the effective

00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:29.437
annual percentage rate.

00:00:29.437 --> 00:00:31.269
I was actually just
browsing the web and I saw

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:34.104
some credit card that had
an annual percentage rate

00:00:34.104 --> 00:00:39.771
of 22.9% annual percentage rate,

00:00:39.771 --> 00:00:41.936
but then right next to it, they say

00:00:41.936 --> 00:00:53.098
that we have 0.06274% daily periodic rate,

00:00:54.936 --> 00:01:00.269
which, to me, this right here
tells me that they compound

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:03.995
the interest on your credit
card balance on a daily basis

00:01:03.995 --> 00:01:06.688
and this is the amount that they compound.

00:01:06.688 --> 00:01:08.197
Where do they get these numbers from?

00:01:08.197 --> 00:01:17.197
If you just take .06274
and multiply by 365 days

00:01:17.197 --> 00:01:21.397
in a year, you should get this 22.9.

00:01:21.397 --> 00:01:22.861
Let's see if we get that.

00:01:22.861 --> 00:01:23.946
Of course this is percentage,

00:01:23.946 --> 00:01:27.352
so this is a percentage here
and this is a percent here.

00:01:27.352 --> 00:01:30.125
Let me get out my trusty
calculator and see if that

00:01:30.125 --> 00:01:31.353
is what they get.

00:01:31.353 --> 00:01:37.991
If I take .06274 -

00:01:37.991 --> 00:01:39.727
Remember, this is a percent,
but I'll just ignore

00:01:39.727 --> 00:01:41.858
the percent sign, so as a
decimal, I would actually add

00:01:41.858 --> 00:01:49.602
two more zeros here, but
.06274 x 365 is equal to,

00:01:49.602 --> 00:01:53.102
right on the money, 22.9%.

00:01:53.102 --> 00:01:54.726
You say, "Hey, Sal,
what's wrong with that?

00:01:54.726 --> 00:01:58.851
"They're charging me .06274% per day,

00:01:58.851 --> 00:02:01.269
"they're going to do
that for 365 days a year,

00:02:01.269 --> 00:02:06.058
"so that gives me 22.9%."

00:02:06.058 --> 00:02:08.858
My reply to you is that
they're compounding

00:02:08.858 --> 00:02:10.125
on a daily basis.

00:02:10.125 --> 00:02:13.858
They're compounding this
number on a daily basis,

00:02:13.858 --> 00:02:16.267
so if you were to give them
$100 and if you didn't have

00:02:16.267 --> 00:02:18.269
to pay some type of a minimum
balance and you just let

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:22.193
that $100 ride for a year,
you wouldn't just owe them

00:02:22.193 --> 00:02:24.391
$122.9.

00:02:24.391 --> 00:02:26.392
They're compounding this much every day,

00:02:26.392 --> 00:02:29.019
so if I were to write
this as a decimal ...

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:31.660
Let me just write that as a decimal.

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:36.993
0.06274%.

00:02:36.993 --> 00:02:44.410
As a decimal this is the
same thing as 0.0006274.

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:45.854
These are the same thing, right?

00:02:45.854 --> 00:02:54.826
1% is .01, so .06% is .0006 as a decimal.

00:02:54.826 --> 00:02:56.918
This is how much they're
charging every day.

00:02:56.918 --> 00:03:00.326
If you watch the
compounding interest video,

00:03:00.326 --> 00:03:02.076
you know that if you wanted
to figure out how much

00:03:02.076 --> 00:03:06.118
total interest you would be
paying over a total year,

00:03:06.118 --> 00:03:09.293
you would take this number, add it to 1,

00:03:09.993 --> 00:03:19.410
so we have 1., this thing
over here, .0006274.

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:23.993
Instead of just taking this
and multiplying it by 365,

00:03:23.993 --> 00:03:30.412
you take this number and you
take it to the 365th power.

00:03:30.412 --> 00:03:33.855
You multiply it by itself 365 times.

00:03:33.855 --> 00:03:36.584
That's because if I have $1 in my balance,

00:03:36.584 --> 00:03:39.669
on day 2, I'm going to
have to pay this much x $1.

00:03:39.669 --> 00:03:43.169
1.0006274 x $1.

00:03:43.169 --> 00:03:44.870
On day 2, I'm going to have to pay

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:48.837
this much x this number again x $1.

00:03:48.837 --> 00:03:49.836
Let me write that down.

00:03:49.836 --> 00:03:58.072
On day 1, maybe I have $1 that I owe them.

00:03:58.072 --> 00:04:06.835
On day 2, it'll be $1 x
this thing, 1.0006274.

00:04:06.835 --> 00:04:14.934
On day 3, I'm going to have to pay 1.00 -

00:04:14.934 --> 00:04:16.066
Actually I forgot a 0.

00:04:16.066 --> 00:04:18.731
06274 x this whole thing.

00:04:18.731 --> 00:04:21.462
On day 3, it'll be $1,
which is the initial amount

00:04:21.462 --> 00:04:27.378
I borrowed, x 1.000, this number, 6274,

00:04:27.378 --> 00:04:29.046
that's just that there and
then I'm going to have to pay

00:04:29.046 --> 00:04:30.712
that much interest on
this whole thing again.

00:04:30.712 --> 00:04:35.732
I'm compounding 1.0006274.

00:04:35.732 --> 00:04:38.879
As you can see, we've kept
the balance for two days.

00:04:38.879 --> 00:04:42.398
I'm raising this to the second
power, by multiplying it

00:04:42.398 --> 00:04:42.999
by itself.

00:04:42.999 --> 00:04:44.378
I'm squaring it.

00:04:44.378 --> 00:04:47.600
If I keep that balance for
365 days, I have to raise it

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:50.463
to the 365th power and
this is counting any kind

00:04:50.463 --> 00:04:53.332
of extra penalties or
fees, so let's figure out -

00:04:53.332 --> 00:04:56.462
This right here, this number,
whatever it is, this is -

00:04:56.462 --> 00:04:58.734
Once I get this and I subtract 1 from it,

00:04:58.734 --> 00:05:01.932
that is the mathematically
true, that is the effective

00:05:01.932 --> 00:05:02.878
annual percentage rate.

00:05:02.878 --> 00:05:04.878
Let's figure out what that is.

00:05:04.878 --> 00:05:22.598
If I take 1.0006274 and I
raise it to the 365 power,

00:05:22.598 --> 00:05:25.128
I get 1.257.

00:05:25.128 --> 00:05:30.045
If I were to compound
this much interest, .06%

00:05:30.045 --> 00:05:35.992
for 365 days, at the end
of a year or 365 days,

00:05:35.992 --> 00:05:40.655
I would owe 1.257 x my
original principle amount.

00:05:40.655 --> 00:05:47.138
This right here is equal to 1.257.

00:05:47.138 --> 00:05:49.989
I would owe 1.257 x my
original principle amount,

00:05:49.989 --> 00:05:53.138
or the effective interest rate.

00:05:53.138 --> 00:05:55.222
Do it in purple.

00:05:55.222 --> 00:06:01.304
The effective APR, annual percentage rate,

00:06:01.304 --> 00:06:04.121
or the mathematically correct
annual percentage rate

00:06:04.121 --> 00:06:08.388
here is 25.7%.

00:06:08.388 --> 00:06:11.520
You might say, "Hey, Sal,
that's still not too far off

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:14.470
"from the reported APR,
where they just take

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:18.720
"this number and multiply
by 365, instead of taking

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:21.123
"this number and taking
it to the 365 power."

00:06:21.123 --> 00:06:23.722
You're saying, "Hey, this is roughly 23%,

00:06:23.722 --> 00:06:27.321
"this is roughly 26%, it's
only a 3% difference."

00:06:27.321 --> 00:06:30.388
If you look at that
compounding interest video,

00:06:30.388 --> 00:06:32.522
even the most basic one
that I put out there,

00:06:32.522 --> 00:06:34.804
you'll see that every
percentage point really, really,

00:06:34.804 --> 00:06:36.722
really matters, especially
if you're going to carry

00:06:36.722 --> 00:06:38.855
these balances for a long period of time.

00:06:38.855 --> 00:06:39.888
Be very careful.

00:06:39.888 --> 00:06:41.655
In general, you shouldn't
carry any balances

00:06:41.655 --> 00:06:43.272
on your credit cards,
because these are very high

00:06:43.272 --> 00:06:45.522
interest rates and you'll
end up just paying interest

00:06:45.522 --> 00:06:47.994
on purchases you made many, many years ago

00:06:47.994 --> 00:06:51.524
and you've long ago lost all
of the joy of that purchase.

00:06:51.524 --> 00:06:53.355
I encourage you to not even keep balances,

00:06:53.355 --> 00:06:54.855
but if you do keep any balances,

00:06:54.855 --> 00:06:56.926
pay very close attention to this.

00:06:56.926 --> 00:07:00.438
That 22.9% APR is still probably not

00:07:00.438 --> 00:07:02.996
the full effective interest
rate, which might be closer

00:07:02.996 --> 00:07:05.128
to 26% in this example.

00:07:05.128 --> 00:07:07.059
That's before they even
count the penalties

00:07:07.059 --> 00:07:09.438
and the other types of
fees that they might throw

00:07:09.438 --> 00:07:11.533
on top of everything.
