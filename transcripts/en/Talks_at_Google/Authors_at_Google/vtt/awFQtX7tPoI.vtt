MALE SPEAKER: And good morning.

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:11.550
Welcome to Talks at Google
in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.240
Today it's my great
privilege and pleasure

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:17.240
to introduce Sherry Turkle.

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:21.930
Dr. Turkle is Professor of
the Social Studies of Science

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.150
and Technology at MIT.

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.860
She's a sociologist and
clinical psychologist,

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:31.140
a leading media scholar
who spent the last three

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.920
decades studying
our relationship

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.680
with the digital
culture we've created.

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:40.470
Her classic studies in the
field are "The Second Self,"

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:44.480
"Life on the Screen,"
and "Alone Together."

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.040
She joins us today
to discuss her latest

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:50.910
book, "Reclaiming
Conversation-- The Power of Talk

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.300
in a Digital Age."

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:56.070
Emphasis here on the power.

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.290
I found this book an eloquent,
profound, and often moving

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:04.500
examination of the
consequences of our addiction

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.100
to our devices for
ourselves and our families,

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.390
and how conversation,
which we may dimly

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:14.260
recall as an
interaction between two

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:19.450
or more humans, in which no
devices are involved, can help.

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:21.910
Please join me in
welcoming Sherry Turkle.

00:01:24.886 --> 00:01:28.694
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:28.694 --> 00:01:30.860
SHERRY TURKLE: Well, that
was a lovely introduction.

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:33.290
And what was
loveliest about it is

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:36.090
that I think it
touches on the fact

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.510
that this really is
a book of my heart.

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:42.240
The other books I've
written-- and I'm

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.360
dedicated to all of them-- all
books are like your children--

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:48.920
basically came out of
my doing-- sponsored

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:54.220
by the NSF or other
funders-- 10, 15 years

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:56.660
of work-- 5, 10,
15 years of work,

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:59.840
and then reporting out
on what I had found.

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.340
And this book began in a
somewhat different way.

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:05.150
At the end of "Alone
Together," which

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:08.389
was a book about a kind
of new social situation

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:12.580
that people found themselves
in-- we'd all be here,

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:15.870
so we were together in a
social situation of some sort.

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:21.030
But we often found
ourselves feeling

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:22.770
that we could find
a sort of place

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:24.730
alone in our heads
in a new kind of way

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:26.410
because we could
go to our phones

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:27.910
and be in a different
kind of space.

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:29.910
Or flip it.

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.090
We would be alone
in our apartment

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:35.570
or in a park or wherever,
but we would feel ourselves

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:39.180
more together with the
world, with our communities--

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.440
a new kind of
global together that

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.020
was absolutely unprecedented.

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:46.664
So the topic of
that book really was

00:02:46.664 --> 00:02:48.080
what was the
psychology, what were

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:49.580
the new political
dynamics, what was

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:52.530
the feeling of that new state.

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:55.839
At the end of that book, as
I listened to the transcripts

00:02:55.839 --> 00:02:58.130
and gone over the hundreds
and hundreds of transcripts,

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:01.860
particularly from young people
but not just from young people,

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:04.210
one phrase kept
coming up-- something

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:06.650
that I really hadn't
had a chance to explore

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:12.670
in that book, which was,
I'd rather text than talk.

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:19.980
As part of the situation of
people who now have the devices

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:23.760
that enable this alone-together
state, these new, always-on,

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.370
always-on-you technologies that
enable this new thing I was

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:28.540
studying--

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:34.120
And I'm a psychologist, and
I'm psychodynamically trained,

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:37.450
which means that I'm interested
in interpersonal dynamics,

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:39.320
the importance of
early childhood,

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:41.910
the importance of
communication and connection

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:44.830
in early childhood, the
importance of empathy

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:48.410
and its development
in early childhood.

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:56.410
And I thought to myself,
OK, let's take seriously--

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:59.940
instead of taking this as
a litany or a catchphrase,

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:04.580
let's really take
seriously-- if people tell me

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:09.550
they'd rather text than talk--
if they're really doing that,

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:11.690
let me explore this
like an ethnographer.

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:14.910
Let me follow this story
in business, in romance,

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:17.910
in the raising of children, and
how people are getting along

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:20.445
in their communities and
with their colleagues,

00:04:20.445 --> 00:04:22.070
with their lovers,
with their families,

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:25.370
with their friends--
let me follow this story

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:28.421
and what will that mean in
all of these areas of life.

00:04:28.421 --> 00:04:29.670
And so that's how I'm trained.

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:31.086
I'm trained to be
an ethnographer.

00:04:31.086 --> 00:04:34.330
And essentially, that's what
"Reclaiming Conversation" is.

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:38.890
It's a look at, for me, a
much broader sweep of data,

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:42.350
because I did go into law
firms and doctors' offices--

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:44.940
the kinds of doctors'
offices where, literally,

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:48.530
doctors are looking at screens
instead of talking to patients

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:52.200
because they're forced to, to
law firms where people felt it

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:56.350
was more important to stay at
their screens than go to lunch

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:57.590
with their colleagues.

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:01.680
Big mistake if you're a lawyer
and want to get promoted.

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:04.220
Big mistake in terms of
the culture of those firms,

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:06.570
but yet, that's how
they felt about it.

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:09.140
Software companies,
where people had

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:13.630
the right kind of cafeterias
and micro-kitchens

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:15.860
to sit down and
have a conversation,

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:19.200
except the highest
value of the company

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:23.350
was that they'd be always
on the messaging system

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:26.250
in order to show their devotion.

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:28.320
So I went to all
kinds of places,

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:31.080
as I say, a much broader
sweep of the world,

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:34.850
and I studied this
issue of conversation.

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:37.000
So what did I find?

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.150
Well, maybe it
makes sense to say

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:41.890
what I found by starting
with a story, which is not

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:43.350
a feel-good story for me.

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:45.110
At the end of-- the
book was published

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:47.010
and I was just waiting
for it to come out.

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:51.040
Before it comes out, a "New
York Times" reporter calls me.

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:53.590
My publisher hadn't
wanted me talking

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:54.960
much before the book comes out.

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:56.730
It's such an event.

00:05:56.730 --> 00:05:59.120
And "The New York Times"
reporter calls me,

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:01.832
and he wants me
to-- now I'm finally

00:06:01.832 --> 00:06:03.290
allowed to talk
about the book-- he

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:05.530
wants me to comment
on a story he's

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:09.280
writing about Hello Barbie.

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:14.390
So Hello Barbie is a robot
doll that comes out of the box

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:19.590
and says, "Hello, I'm Barbie.

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:21.810
I think I love you.

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:23.440
I have a sister.

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:25.610
I don't like her so much.

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:27.240
I think I'm jealous of her.

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:28.760
I hear you have a sister.

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:30.750
Are you jealous of your sister?

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:32.260
Let's talk?"

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:35.060
In other words, it
comes out of the box

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:38.400
with a pretend-empathy
narrative and starts

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:40.450
to try to engage
you in conversation

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:44.200
about this
pretend-empathy narrative,

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:46.760
with the idea that
that will be--

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:48.960
this just pretend
best-friend thing that

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:50.770
will be conversation.

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:56.980
So my position on
this-- everything

00:06:56.980 --> 00:06:59.580
I know about kids growing
up and from studying

00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:02.320
sociable robotics and
how kids respond to it--

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:07.590
is that you can get a kid
to talk to a robot that

00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:10.030
offers pretend empathy.

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:16.620
But you can't get a child to
learn and experience empathy

00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:19.460
from a robot that
has none to give,

00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:22.950
because this robot
hasn't known a life,

00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:27.570
it doesn't have a sister, it
doesn't know what jealousy is.

00:07:27.570 --> 00:07:32.260
In other words,
this conversation

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:38.250
is not going to do the job
that conversation needs to do.

00:07:38.250 --> 00:07:44.370
So it turns out-- after studying
law offices and business

00:07:44.370 --> 00:07:47.990
offices and families--
now there is

00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:52.290
another part of the story,
in fact, too, which, in fact,

00:07:52.290 --> 00:07:54.540
I do end the book on
the issue of robotics.

00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:57.890
But Hello Barbie
wasn't on the market.

00:07:57.890 --> 00:08:01.030
I would have ended the book with
Hello Barbie if it had been.

00:08:01.030 --> 00:08:03.510
It turns out that
sociable robotics is also

00:08:03.510 --> 00:08:08.180
part of this story of a crisis
of conversation, because we're

00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:11.890
offering ourselves and
our children objects that

00:08:11.890 --> 00:08:14.040
are a faux conversation.

00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:17.190
So just to give you some
sense of all the ways

00:08:17.190 --> 00:08:19.890
we can't learn empathy
now in our culture,

00:08:19.890 --> 00:08:22.290
and yet, there's
an empathy crisis.

00:08:22.290 --> 00:08:25.820
And I'm going to argue-- just
to give the argument that

00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:28.070
I'm going to make today and
that I make in "Reclaiming

00:08:28.070 --> 00:08:31.360
Conversation"-- that
to this empathy crisis,

00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:34.740
conversation is the remedy.

00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:37.970
And, to make a bad pun, I
call it the talking cure.

00:08:37.970 --> 00:08:40.380
And that, in fact,
is where the book

00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:46.850
began-- with a 40% drop
in all markers for empathy

00:08:46.850 --> 00:08:48.210
among college students.

00:08:48.210 --> 00:08:51.810
It was a meta-analysis that
looked at many surveys--

00:08:51.810 --> 00:08:54.500
many studies-- over
the past 20 years.

00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:56.970
There's this 40% drop
among college students

00:08:56.970 --> 00:08:59.710
in many markers for
empathy-- most of it

00:08:59.710 --> 00:09:02.480
in the past 10 years.

00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:06.350
And in our conversation--
because I'm

00:09:06.350 --> 00:09:09.430
going to talk about
half my time--

00:09:09.430 --> 00:09:13.580
it's telling that the
very brilliant woman who

00:09:13.580 --> 00:09:18.210
was the head of this
study, after learning this,

00:09:18.210 --> 00:09:23.480
decided to write empathy
apps for the iPhone.

00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:28.490
So the whole
question of-- let us

00:09:28.490 --> 00:09:33.790
grant that part of the way we
got ourselves into some trouble

00:09:33.790 --> 00:09:39.100
with empathy, which is born from
looking at someone in the eye,

00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:42.850
not breaking that contact,
hearing what they have to say,

00:09:42.850 --> 00:09:45.090
they're hearing back
what you have to say,

00:09:45.090 --> 00:09:49.900
taking some time-- let us
grant that interrupting that,

00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:54.090
by going like this, is
part of the problem.

00:09:54.090 --> 00:09:58.390
To what degree do we want to
solve it with this technology

00:09:58.390 --> 00:10:01.170
that we have always on hand?

00:10:01.170 --> 00:10:03.030
How much are we going
to look to technology

00:10:03.030 --> 00:10:06.110
to solve the problem
that, perhaps, technology

00:10:06.110 --> 00:10:06.900
got us into?

00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:12.010
It obviously is very
seductive to do that.

00:10:12.010 --> 00:10:14.760
But is that a good idea?

00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:20.800
So I found out that I
began to get more evidence

00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:25.850
about the empathy crisis
when I was called in

00:10:25.850 --> 00:10:30.420
to consult in middle
schools for much younger

00:10:30.420 --> 00:10:33.204
students than college students.

00:10:33.204 --> 00:10:35.120
And in one school in
particular-- in the book,

00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:38.240
I call it the Holbrook School--
the teachers were saying

00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:40.750
that the students, about
12-year-old students,

00:10:40.750 --> 00:10:43.000
were behaving like
eight-year-old students.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:44.470
They were showing
a kind of cruelty

00:10:44.470 --> 00:10:46.900
to their fellow students--
not on the Internet,

00:10:46.900 --> 00:10:49.930
not in cyberbullying situations.

00:10:49.930 --> 00:10:52.090
But really, the
teachers were saying

00:10:52.090 --> 00:10:56.590
they didn't seem to understand
how other students were feeling

00:10:56.590 --> 00:10:58.620
when other students
were talking to them.

00:10:58.620 --> 00:11:02.430
They essentially were
describing a crisis of empathy.

00:11:02.430 --> 00:11:04.680
And they didn't
seem to get it when

00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:06.300
their teachers spoke to them.

00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:08.420
They said 12-year-old
students behaved

00:11:08.420 --> 00:11:11.160
like eight-year-old students.

00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:13.920
So it was a very
dramatic study for me--

00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:19.500
all these places where I was
finding teachers and educators

00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:22.690
of-- did a large
study of teachers

00:11:22.690 --> 00:11:24.470
and all kinds of
educators in that age

00:11:24.470 --> 00:11:27.980
range, who were all talking
about kind of the same thing.

00:11:27.980 --> 00:11:30.370
But then there were
a group of studies

00:11:30.370 --> 00:11:35.540
that were truly optimistic and
that I want to share with you.

00:11:35.540 --> 00:11:39.960
In only five days without
phones in a summer camp that's

00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:45.410
device-free, young
people get those empathy

00:11:45.410 --> 00:11:48.130
markers to come right back up.

00:11:48.130 --> 00:11:54.890
In other words, we are built
to have an empathic response

00:11:54.890 --> 00:11:55.480
to each other.

00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:58.340
Now how do they get
those empathy markers

00:11:58.340 --> 00:11:59.850
to come back up?

00:11:59.850 --> 00:12:01.580
They talk to each other.

00:12:01.580 --> 00:12:04.890
They talk to each other without
turning away from each other

00:12:04.890 --> 00:12:06.780
to look for a device.

00:12:06.780 --> 00:12:12.250
So getting back to the Barbie,
and getting back to the fact

00:12:12.250 --> 00:12:15.190
that most kids have phones when
they're five or six or seven,

00:12:15.190 --> 00:12:17.680
why would we give
kids-- just at the time

00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:21.080
when they're developing
that empathic response,

00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:22.800
why would we want
to give children

00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:26.920
an object that will block
the development of empathy?

00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:31.210
And phones do block the
development of empathy,

00:12:31.210 --> 00:12:32.690
not because we meant them to.

00:12:32.690 --> 00:12:34.870
It's not because
we said, oh, we're

00:12:34.870 --> 00:12:37.640
going to just invent
something that's really going

00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:39.040
to get in the way of empathy.

00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:43.310
It's just because, when you
go like that to a person,

00:12:43.310 --> 00:12:46.470
you're putting them
on pause and you're

00:12:46.470 --> 00:12:50.930
saying that you
can't attend to what

00:12:50.930 --> 00:12:52.700
they're thinking or feeling.

00:12:52.700 --> 00:12:56.010
Now the more developed
and older the person is,

00:12:56.010 --> 00:12:58.920
the less-- let's say--
damage it's going to do.

00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:01.810
But a series of studies
show that if you are sitting

00:13:01.810 --> 00:13:05.170
at a table and you put
a phone, a silent phone,

00:13:05.170 --> 00:13:10.640
on the table between
you, first of all,

00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:14.670
the conversation will
go to trivial matters.

00:13:14.670 --> 00:13:17.480
The topic of the
conversation will change.

00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:20.280
It will not be about
important things.

00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:24.540
And secondly, you will feel
less empathic connection

00:13:24.540 --> 00:13:27.290
with the person
you're talking to.

00:13:27.290 --> 00:13:31.000
And then they re-did this
study in a natural setting,

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.980
where they put the phone,
not between two people having

00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:37.430
lunch, but in the periphery
of the landscape-- like if you

00:13:37.430 --> 00:13:39.630
put the phone almost
where I couldn't see it

00:13:39.630 --> 00:13:42.520
at the edge of the
stage, and had me talking

00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:46.480
to somebody at lunch,
but the phone's

00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:48.390
almost like at the next table.

00:13:48.390 --> 00:13:52.400
And they got the same
results-- conversation

00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:57.300
on things less important,
and less sense of commitment

00:13:57.300 --> 00:14:00.250
and connection, less empathic
sense with the person

00:14:00.250 --> 00:14:01.690
you're talking with.

00:14:01.690 --> 00:14:04.570
Essentially, it makes
every kind of sense

00:14:04.570 --> 00:14:07.970
that if people think they're
going to be interrupted,

00:14:07.970 --> 00:14:10.250
their attitude toward
a conversation changes.

00:14:10.250 --> 00:14:13.890
It's really as simple as that.

00:14:13.890 --> 00:14:15.840
And college students know that.

00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:18.130
They know that they don't
pay attention to each other

00:14:18.130 --> 00:14:19.479
when they have their phones.

00:14:19.479 --> 00:14:21.020
And they talked to
me about something

00:14:21.020 --> 00:14:24.160
they called the rule of threes,
as a lot of my own research

00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:26.450
took place on college campuses.

00:14:26.450 --> 00:14:33.880
So one young man says to me,
introducing the Rule of Three--

00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:35.520
because at the
beginning, I had been

00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:39.630
thinking of doing a study
on the nature of texting,

00:14:39.630 --> 00:14:41.580
on the diction of
texting, really

00:14:41.580 --> 00:14:44.650
getting deeply into the
linguistics of texting.

00:14:44.650 --> 00:14:45.910
And he said, don't do that.

00:14:45.910 --> 00:14:50.620
It's not our texting, he says,
that's getting us into trouble.

00:14:50.620 --> 00:14:56.170
It's what our texting is doing
to our in-person conversations.

00:14:56.170 --> 00:14:58.940
And that really was my
lodestar for this study.

00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:01.830
It's not our texting that's
getting us into trouble,

00:15:01.830 --> 00:15:05.030
he said, it's what
our texting is doing

00:15:05.030 --> 00:15:07.680
to our in-person conversations.

00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:09.180
And I said, well, tell me more.

00:15:09.180 --> 00:15:11.900
And to illustrate
this, I get the story

00:15:11.900 --> 00:15:12.990
about the Rule of Three.

00:15:12.990 --> 00:15:14.720
And here's the Rule of Three.

00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:17.190
When you're at
dinner-- let's say

00:15:17.190 --> 00:15:22.700
it's six-- three people
have to have their heads up

00:15:22.700 --> 00:15:25.590
before you give
yourself permission

00:15:25.590 --> 00:15:28.080
to put your head down to
text, because everybody

00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:31.290
has their phone and everybody's
going to be texting at dinner.

00:15:31.290 --> 00:15:34.160
So the Rule of Three is
a kind of new politeness

00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:38.420
about when you can let
your attention go down.

00:15:38.420 --> 00:15:40.990
So what is the result
of the Rule of Three?

00:15:40.990 --> 00:15:43.570
It's exactly the result
of all those studies

00:15:43.570 --> 00:15:45.930
that took place with the
silent phone on the table,

00:15:45.930 --> 00:15:49.740
that that changed the
nature of discussion

00:15:49.740 --> 00:15:52.090
and gave people less
than empathic connection

00:15:52.090 --> 00:15:53.200
with each other.

00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:55.550
Things are kept
light and on subjects

00:15:55.550 --> 00:15:57.490
where you don't mind
being interrupted,

00:15:57.490 --> 00:16:00.950
and people feel less of
an empathic connection

00:16:00.950 --> 00:16:02.950
with each other.

00:16:02.950 --> 00:16:06.770
And it's not just
among college students.

00:16:06.770 --> 00:16:12.300
I should mention a recent Pew
study showed that 89% of adults

00:16:12.300 --> 00:16:15.270
say that, in their last
social interaction,

00:16:15.270 --> 00:16:16.980
they took out a phone.

00:16:16.980 --> 00:16:23.000
And 82% say that it
diminished the conversation.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:27.100
Now that study goes on to
be very realistic and very

00:16:27.100 --> 00:16:30.259
positive and very upbeat about
all the great things people did

00:16:30.259 --> 00:16:31.550
when they took out their phone.

00:16:31.550 --> 00:16:34.890
They looked up a movie, they
looked up a cinematographer,

00:16:34.890 --> 00:16:39.010
they checked a thing
in their neighborhood.

00:16:39.010 --> 00:16:42.120
The phone is completely
integrated in their life.

00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:44.825
But, bottom line,
89% interrupted

00:16:44.825 --> 00:16:49.770
a social interaction; 82% say
it lessened the conversation.

00:16:49.770 --> 00:16:51.500
Rule of Three.

00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:53.920
And then there's
the Rule of Seven.

00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:56.530
The Rule of Seven is
what a college junior

00:16:56.530 --> 00:16:58.230
described as this.

00:16:58.230 --> 00:17:04.380
It takes seven minutes to know
where a conversation is going

00:17:04.380 --> 00:17:08.450
to go, just like it
probably takes seven minutes

00:17:08.450 --> 00:17:13.280
to know whether you're going
to pay close attention to this.

00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:17.270
You have to get used to
somebody's body in the room,

00:17:17.270 --> 00:17:19.980
the way somebody speaks,
the kind of cadence,

00:17:19.980 --> 00:17:22.089
how they express themselves.

00:17:22.089 --> 00:17:24.410
But certainly in a
conversation, where

00:17:24.410 --> 00:17:26.910
you're adjusting to each
other, there are fits

00:17:26.910 --> 00:17:28.820
and there are starts
and there are lulls,

00:17:28.820 --> 00:17:31.910
it takes seven minutes
to see whether this

00:17:31.910 --> 00:17:35.050
is going to be worth her
time, she explains to me.

00:17:35.050 --> 00:17:40.340
And then she says, I often
don't put in my seven minutes,

00:17:40.340 --> 00:17:42.660
because I just would
rather go to the phone

00:17:42.660 --> 00:17:47.740
and get the reliability
of that steady feed.

00:17:47.740 --> 00:17:50.790
It's easier to just send a text
during those seven minutes.

00:17:50.790 --> 00:17:53.770
It's easier to get
something sure and certain,

00:17:53.770 --> 00:17:56.490
and it's more efficient.

00:17:56.490 --> 00:17:58.610
And a lot of people
I interviewed

00:17:58.610 --> 00:18:04.200
said that-- they don't
put in that kind of time

00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:08.330
or wait for that kind of
lull, or allow themselves

00:18:08.330 --> 00:18:12.540
a moment of boredom in
conversations today.

00:18:12.540 --> 00:18:16.870
Before that happens,
they go to a phone.

00:18:16.870 --> 00:18:21.480
So you can see a kind of
perfect storm building up here.

00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:27.200
All roads led me to a crisis in
a certain kind of conversation.

00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:29.180
It's not like we're not talking.

00:18:29.180 --> 00:18:31.980
I'm talking about the kind
of conversation that's

00:18:31.980 --> 00:18:34.620
spontaneous, open ended,
where there are tangents,

00:18:34.620 --> 00:18:36.600
where you allow
yourself lulls, where

00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:39.140
you don't interrupt each
other, where there's eye

00:18:39.140 --> 00:18:42.890
contact-- the kind of thing
where empathy is born,

00:18:42.890 --> 00:18:46.480
where creativity is
most likely to happen.

00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:49.870
And a crisis in
empathy is happening,

00:18:49.870 --> 00:18:52.450
and I'm arguing that
conversation is the talking

00:18:52.450 --> 00:18:53.230
cure.

00:18:53.230 --> 00:18:56.990
Conversation-- that
kind of conversation--

00:18:56.990 --> 00:19:02.700
is the most human and humanizing
thing that we know how to do,

00:19:02.700 --> 00:19:05.800
that doesn't take
away in the slightest

00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:09.630
from the fun and the
intellectual qualities

00:19:09.630 --> 00:19:11.820
and the sexiness
and the eroticism

00:19:11.820 --> 00:19:17.360
and the joy of texting,
and e-mail, and messaging,

00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:20.420
and everything, just everything.

00:19:20.420 --> 00:19:25.330
It just means that conversation
has some particularities,

00:19:25.330 --> 00:19:27.740
even in our
neurophysiology, that

00:19:27.740 --> 00:19:31.850
makes it the ideal thing
for teaching empathy

00:19:31.850 --> 00:19:35.550
and for getting certain
kinds of results

00:19:35.550 --> 00:19:40.010
in creativity, collaboration,
and developing the human.

00:19:40.010 --> 00:19:42.360
It's the training
ground for empathy.

00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:45.250
And I'm not saying to
put away your phones

00:19:45.250 --> 00:19:48.420
for a certain amount of
time because it's polite,

00:19:48.420 --> 00:19:50.870
or because I want you to
learn some kind of art

00:19:50.870 --> 00:19:54.060
of conversation, to be
kind of fancy talkers.

00:19:54.060 --> 00:19:56.980
I'm really saying that this
flight from conversation,

00:19:56.980 --> 00:19:59.470
the fact that we don't
want to sit around

00:19:59.470 --> 00:20:01.790
the boring bits-- as
one woman said to me,

00:20:01.790 --> 00:20:04.260
I don't like the boring
bits-- is actually

00:20:04.260 --> 00:20:07.060
interfering with
something we need to do

00:20:07.060 --> 00:20:09.640
for each other as human beings.

00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:11.790
There are great
ironies, as I said.

00:20:11.790 --> 00:20:13.310
Even though the
psychologists are

00:20:13.310 --> 00:20:16.210
agreeing on this
crisis in empathy,

00:20:16.210 --> 00:20:21.380
there's this big movement to
create these empathy apps--

00:20:21.380 --> 00:20:24.580
getting ourselves into
trouble and wanting technology

00:20:24.580 --> 00:20:28.560
to cure it, just as people
are intolerant of being alone

00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:31.760
and want technology
to cure that.

00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:33.980
Many of you may have
heard of a study that's

00:20:33.980 --> 00:20:37.350
become widely cited, in
which a group of college

00:20:37.350 --> 00:20:41.130
students-- this was part
of a group of 21 studies--

00:20:41.130 --> 00:20:44.190
but one study at the
University of Virginia,

00:20:44.190 --> 00:20:48.920
a group of college students were
told that they would be asked

00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:51.970
to sit alone from
six to 15 minutes

00:20:51.970 --> 00:20:53.170
and were they OK with that.

00:20:53.170 --> 00:20:53.670
Sure.

00:20:53.670 --> 00:20:54.860
No devices, no books.

00:20:54.860 --> 00:20:55.889
Sure.

00:20:55.889 --> 00:20:57.930
Did they think they might
want to give themselves

00:20:57.930 --> 00:21:02.120
electroshocks
during that period.

00:21:02.120 --> 00:21:04.530
No, not really.

00:21:04.530 --> 00:21:05.420
No.

00:21:05.420 --> 00:21:07.295
They were asked to
test the shocking out.

00:21:07.295 --> 00:21:08.490
They tested it.

00:21:08.490 --> 00:21:11.410
No, really not.

00:21:11.410 --> 00:21:13.910
And then they were just asked
to sit alone without a device.

00:21:13.910 --> 00:21:17.001
After six minutes, the students
were shocking themselves.

00:21:17.001 --> 00:21:17.500
[CHUCKLING]

00:21:17.500 --> 00:21:22.230
So being alone
was so intolerable

00:21:22.230 --> 00:21:25.570
that they would rather give
themselves electroshocks

00:21:25.570 --> 00:21:28.190
than sit quietly with
their own thoughts.

00:21:28.190 --> 00:21:31.860
Being alone is a problem that
we want technology to solve.

00:21:31.860 --> 00:21:34.800
And I bring this up
because there is actually

00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:40.100
an important connection that
I want to leave you with.

00:21:40.100 --> 00:21:43.210
If you leave with
one thing, it's

00:21:43.210 --> 00:21:45.800
like-- this is
the thing to leave

00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:50.290
with-- this important
connection between conversation

00:21:50.290 --> 00:21:52.730
and solitude, because
I think this is where

00:21:52.730 --> 00:21:55.550
my work is often misunderstood.

00:21:55.550 --> 00:21:57.300
They'll say, well,
sure, Sherry Turkle

00:21:57.300 --> 00:21:59.320
says the problem is we're
looking at our devices

00:21:59.320 --> 00:22:00.340
when we're together.

00:22:00.340 --> 00:22:01.320
OK, grant her that.

00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:02.350
That's not so cool.

00:22:02.350 --> 00:22:04.560
But what about if I look at
my device when I'm alone?

00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:06.720
Who's that bothering?

00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:09.790
That's not a
problem for anybody.

00:22:09.790 --> 00:22:13.830
You need to have a
capacity for solitude

00:22:13.830 --> 00:22:18.260
in order to have a
capacity for sociality.

00:22:18.260 --> 00:22:24.140
The link between conversation
and solitude is tremendous.

00:22:24.140 --> 00:22:27.250
We cannot solve our
flight from conversation,

00:22:27.250 --> 00:22:32.640
our crisis of empathy, without
dealing with our incapacity

00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:37.910
for solitude, with our
flight from solitude.

00:22:37.910 --> 00:22:42.300
That it's only when you can
gather yourself, be content

00:22:42.300 --> 00:22:46.460
with yourself, and, because of
that, talk to another person

00:22:46.460 --> 00:22:49.830
and really see who
they are as a person,

00:22:49.830 --> 00:22:53.210
and hear them for who
they are because you're

00:22:53.210 --> 00:22:57.450
OK with yourself, can you
begin to have a conversation.

00:22:57.450 --> 00:22:59.150
The way psychologists
have put this

00:22:59.150 --> 00:23:03.030
so beautifully is that, if you
don't teach your children to be

00:23:03.030 --> 00:23:07.650
alone, they'll only know how
to be lonely-- that solitude

00:23:07.650 --> 00:23:09.760
and sociality go together.

00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:12.640
And that's why you can't
just say, oh, well,

00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:14.645
the devices-- I'll
worry about the devices

00:23:14.645 --> 00:23:15.770
when I'm with other people.

00:23:15.770 --> 00:23:20.330
But whatever I do by myself, my
intolerance for having a moment

00:23:20.330 --> 00:23:22.860
alone, that's nothing.

00:23:22.860 --> 00:23:26.120
We have to be more intentional
in our use of devices

00:23:26.120 --> 00:23:29.920
for ourselves, not just because
we're breaking up conversations

00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:31.540
with other people.

00:23:31.540 --> 00:23:33.290
So what I'm basically
saying is that we're

00:23:33.290 --> 00:23:36.880
at a kind of Rachel
Carson moment--

00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:39.360
distracted at our dinner
tables and living rooms,

00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:42.110
at business meetings
and in classrooms.

00:23:42.110 --> 00:23:44.660
I see traces of the
new Silent Spring--

00:23:44.660 --> 00:23:47.340
that's the term
that Carson coined--

00:23:47.340 --> 00:23:51.130
when we were ready to see
that with technological change

00:23:51.130 --> 00:23:54.340
had come an assault
on our environment.

00:23:54.340 --> 00:23:57.046
And now we've arrived at
another moment of recognition.

00:24:00.520 --> 00:24:02.660
When I wrote "Alone
Together," people

00:24:02.660 --> 00:24:05.777
thought it was a good book, but
people wanted to fight with me.

00:24:05.777 --> 00:24:07.610
It was like, OK, this
is a really good book.

00:24:07.610 --> 00:24:09.610
Let's fight about this.

00:24:09.610 --> 00:24:12.680
And now I really feel
that we've arrived

00:24:12.680 --> 00:24:15.180
at a moment of
recognition when people

00:24:15.180 --> 00:24:19.130
feel that something is amiss.

00:24:19.130 --> 00:24:20.990
Something is amiss.

00:24:20.990 --> 00:24:25.550
We have a great technology,
but something is amiss.

00:24:25.550 --> 00:24:30.090
We need to get it more
aligned with the lives

00:24:30.090 --> 00:24:31.620
we want to leave.

00:24:31.620 --> 00:24:34.650
This time, technology
is implicated

00:24:34.650 --> 00:24:37.200
in an assault on empathy.

00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:40.490
Rachel Carson's moment was
a moment of recognition

00:24:40.490 --> 00:24:43.880
that we were at a point
where we had to do something

00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:45.600
and we could do something.

00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:48.450
And now, too, we
can do something.

00:24:48.450 --> 00:24:52.350
We can do many somethings,
many somethings, both

00:24:52.350 --> 00:24:54.110
in how we design
technology-- I'm

00:24:54.110 --> 00:24:58.120
delighted to be speaking
here, delighted to be here--

00:24:58.120 --> 00:25:00.580
and how we use technology.

00:25:00.580 --> 00:25:01.670
There are many somethings.

00:25:01.670 --> 00:25:04.519
I'm just going to quickly
rush through a couple

00:25:04.519 --> 00:25:06.060
of these little
somethings, so as not

00:25:06.060 --> 00:25:08.950
to take too much more than
seven minutes on all the things

00:25:08.950 --> 00:25:09.450
to do.

00:25:09.450 --> 00:25:10.991
And then I hope that
in the questions

00:25:10.991 --> 00:25:14.380
we can open up to
more somethings.

00:25:14.380 --> 00:25:17.150
These somethings sound
like little somethings,

00:25:17.150 --> 00:25:21.750
but when you add them together,
it's a change in culture.

00:25:21.750 --> 00:25:24.030
We're not looking for solutions.

00:25:24.030 --> 00:25:27.270
We're looking for first steps.

00:25:27.270 --> 00:25:29.010
So what are some first steps?

00:25:29.010 --> 00:25:31.480
First of all, act
with intention.

00:25:31.480 --> 00:25:34.980
A father is giving his
two-year-old daughter a bath,

00:25:34.980 --> 00:25:39.400
and he's doing his
mail on the iPhone.

00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:42.330
And he says to me, I remember
giving my 11-year-old daughter

00:25:42.330 --> 00:25:43.887
a bath when she was two.

00:25:43.887 --> 00:25:45.970
And he used to just sit
with her, and talk to her,

00:25:45.970 --> 00:25:50.270
and sing to her, and play
with the little toys she

00:25:50.270 --> 00:25:51.240
had in her bathtub.

00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:53.550
I kind of miss that
with my two-year-old.

00:25:53.550 --> 00:25:57.540
I play-- I don't do that.

00:25:57.540 --> 00:26:01.640
I just do my mail on my iPhone.

00:26:01.640 --> 00:26:05.400
Technology makes us forget
what we know about life.

00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:06.590
That's author's choice.

00:26:06.590 --> 00:26:09.860
That's my favorite line
in my book-- technology

00:26:09.860 --> 00:26:11.790
makes us forget what
we know about life.

00:26:11.790 --> 00:26:17.800
He knows that he is doing
something that's amiss.

00:26:17.800 --> 00:26:21.220
That little girl needs some
conversation from her dad.

00:26:21.220 --> 00:26:24.920
And he enjoyed, and
was nurtured himself,

00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:27.170
by talking to his older child.

00:26:27.170 --> 00:26:30.050
At a moment like this,
pull up your socks

00:26:30.050 --> 00:26:33.300
pull yourself together,
and put down the phone.

00:26:33.300 --> 00:26:36.250
So act with intention.

00:26:36.250 --> 00:26:39.080
Participate, however you
can, in a revitalization

00:26:39.080 --> 00:26:45.340
of public conversation, because
public conversations teach us.

00:26:45.340 --> 00:26:47.582
They model how
conversation can unfold.

00:26:47.582 --> 00:26:49.540
Too many of my students
say they don't know how

00:26:49.540 --> 00:26:51.250
to have a public conversation.

00:26:51.250 --> 00:26:53.960
They don't know how to
have a conversation.

00:26:53.960 --> 00:26:56.210
They say their families
didn't talk at dinner.

00:26:56.210 --> 00:26:58.010
I lay a lot of this on parents.

00:26:58.010 --> 00:27:00.890
It was my generation
that thought

00:27:00.890 --> 00:27:04.560
we would only get a Dick
Tracy two-way wrist radio.

00:27:04.560 --> 00:27:06.760
That was the best
we would ever get.

00:27:06.760 --> 00:27:09.250
And then, all of a sudden,
I have a smartphone,

00:27:09.250 --> 00:27:11.990
and this is amazing.

00:27:11.990 --> 00:27:14.540
And we didn't talk to our kids.

00:27:14.540 --> 00:27:17.380
It's parents who didn't talk
at breakfast and dinner.

00:27:17.380 --> 00:27:20.230
It's kids who are telling
me that they never

00:27:20.230 --> 00:27:23.330
took a walk with their
father to the corner store

00:27:23.330 --> 00:27:25.900
when the father didn't
have his phone with him.

00:27:25.900 --> 00:27:30.250
So it's very important that
we have public conversations,

00:27:30.250 --> 00:27:32.170
including classrooms,
where there's

00:27:32.170 --> 00:27:35.200
a lot of talk, which is part
of my problem with putting

00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:37.410
everything on screens
and distance learning.

00:27:37.410 --> 00:27:39.990
Not that it, itself,
isn't good, but you

00:27:39.990 --> 00:27:43.400
have to worry every time
you take conversation away

00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:44.800
from the classroom.

00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:47.170
Remember that the
presence of a device

00:27:47.170 --> 00:27:50.880
already signals that your
attention is divided, even

00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:53.060
if you do not intend it to be.

00:27:53.060 --> 00:27:55.705
So remember those studies
of phones on the table.

00:27:55.705 --> 00:27:57.830
Remember that when you put
that phone on the table,

00:27:57.830 --> 00:28:02.240
you were signaling that you
could be elsewhere, even if you

00:28:02.240 --> 00:28:04.270
don't mean to go elsewhere.

00:28:04.270 --> 00:28:05.990
So do the simplest thing.

00:28:05.990 --> 00:28:08.580
Just don't put it on the table.

00:28:08.580 --> 00:28:11.310
Accept what research
has made clear.

00:28:11.310 --> 00:28:12.890
And you've heard
this so many times.

00:28:12.890 --> 00:28:13.640
It's so boring.

00:28:13.640 --> 00:28:15.810
Anyway, just listen to me.

00:28:15.810 --> 00:28:18.060
Uni-tasking is the
next big thing.

00:28:18.060 --> 00:28:20.420
There is no such
thing as multitasking.

00:28:20.420 --> 00:28:23.070
Do one thing at a time.

00:28:23.070 --> 00:28:25.720
Really, be in the vanguard.

00:28:25.720 --> 00:28:27.300
Everybody knows this.

00:28:27.300 --> 00:28:28.600
Nobody wants to hear it.

00:28:28.600 --> 00:28:30.360
So I've said it.

00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:33.170
You know it's true.

00:28:33.170 --> 00:28:37.070
Conversation is the human
way to practice uni-tasking.

00:28:37.070 --> 00:28:41.750
It's part of the reason
why it's so hard.

00:28:41.750 --> 00:28:43.760
Don't try to be perfect.

00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:46.160
My students come to me
and they say they do not

00:28:46.160 --> 00:28:47.620
want to go to office hours.

00:28:47.620 --> 00:28:52.410
They want to write me an
email instead of office hours.

00:28:52.410 --> 00:28:56.110
Why do they want to
write me an email?

00:28:56.110 --> 00:28:59.040
Because they will
write the email

00:28:59.040 --> 00:29:01.840
that best expresses
their question,

00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:04.850
and I will write
them an email back

00:29:04.850 --> 00:29:08.850
that perfectly answers-- that's
perfectly pitched and gives

00:29:08.850 --> 00:29:11.730
them the most information back.

00:29:11.730 --> 00:29:16.670
It's a transaction,
and it's perfect.

00:29:16.670 --> 00:29:20.920
Who developed a love of
knowledge, a love of learning?

00:29:20.920 --> 00:29:23.900
Am I here today
because I really asked

00:29:23.900 --> 00:29:27.140
a perfect question and somebody
gave me a perfect answer?

00:29:27.140 --> 00:29:28.000
No.

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:29.830
There is no one who
developed a love

00:29:29.830 --> 00:29:31.160
of learning for that reason.

00:29:31.160 --> 00:29:33.740
It's because somebody
sat down with me,

00:29:33.740 --> 00:29:37.540
believed in me, because I looked
at somebody in a conversation

00:29:37.540 --> 00:29:39.910
and said, I could
be like that person.

00:29:39.910 --> 00:29:43.720
I could be-- what would it take
for me to be like that person,

00:29:43.720 --> 00:29:47.310
and that person is talking
to me and interested in me.

00:29:47.310 --> 00:29:49.480
That's how it happens.

00:29:49.480 --> 00:29:51.450
Cultivate solitude.

00:29:51.450 --> 00:29:55.820
The capacity to be alone with
your thoughts is crucial.

00:29:55.820 --> 00:29:57.620
Some of the most
crucial conversations

00:29:57.620 --> 00:30:00.970
you're going to have are
conversations with yourself.

00:30:00.970 --> 00:30:05.290
To have them, you have to learn
to listen with your own voice,

00:30:05.290 --> 00:30:07.700
set aside your laptops
and your tablets,

00:30:07.700 --> 00:30:09.470
and put away your phone.

00:30:12.430 --> 00:30:16.860
And finally, obey the
Seven Minute Rule.

00:30:16.860 --> 00:30:20.910
That's the rule suggested to
me by a college junior, that

00:30:20.910 --> 00:30:23.280
says that it takes at
least seven minutes to see

00:30:23.280 --> 00:30:26.400
how a conversation
is going to unfold.

00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:29.750
You have to let it unfold,
and not go to your phone

00:30:29.750 --> 00:30:31.830
before those minutes pass.

00:30:31.830 --> 00:30:37.520
If there is a lull in the
conversation, let it be.

00:30:37.520 --> 00:30:41.370
Every technology challenges
our human values,

00:30:41.370 --> 00:30:44.530
which is a good thing because
it causes us to reflect

00:30:44.530 --> 00:30:46.950
on what these values are.

00:30:46.950 --> 00:30:48.980
If we've invented
a technology that

00:30:48.980 --> 00:30:55.240
causes us to look at each other
less, to make less eye contact,

00:30:55.240 --> 00:30:57.810
that needs to be a signal to us.

00:30:57.810 --> 00:31:01.150
And the message of my book
is that we're all in this

00:31:01.150 --> 00:31:02.340
together.

00:31:02.340 --> 00:31:06.100
Let's just look up,
look at each other,

00:31:06.100 --> 00:31:08.480
and start the conversation.

00:31:08.480 --> 00:31:10.059
Thank you very much.

00:31:10.059 --> 00:31:13.552
[APPLAUSE]

00:31:15.940 --> 00:31:17.850
So questions.

00:31:17.850 --> 00:31:18.870
Yes.

00:31:18.870 --> 00:31:21.880
AUDIENCE: Previous generations
have-- the last generation,

00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:24.930
anyway, tended to
use television when

00:31:24.930 --> 00:31:29.770
they didn't want to be
alone-- that sense of breaking

00:31:29.770 --> 00:31:30.440
the loneliness.

00:31:30.440 --> 00:31:32.860
And from what I understand
from recent studies,

00:31:32.860 --> 00:31:36.470
the use of television that way
is decreasing to some degree,

00:31:36.470 --> 00:31:40.740
as people are spending more time
either online, or potentially

00:31:40.740 --> 00:31:43.830
online, with some sort of chat.

00:31:43.830 --> 00:31:48.290
Do you think that this decrease
in empathy-- that people

00:31:48.290 --> 00:31:53.330
actually saw modeled
conversation, modeled empathy

00:31:53.330 --> 00:31:55.740
in TV, and that
the decrease in TV

00:31:55.740 --> 00:31:59.720
is potentially a bad thing,
as weird as that sounds?

00:31:59.720 --> 00:32:03.225
I mean, how do you compare
TV as a form of using that--

00:32:03.225 --> 00:32:04.600
SHERRY TURKLE:
Well, I think TV--

00:32:04.600 --> 00:32:04.950
AUDIENCE: --avoiding
loneliness--

00:32:04.950 --> 00:32:06.390
SHERRY TURKLE: Let me
just say a word about TV.

00:32:06.390 --> 00:32:06.710
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:32:06.710 --> 00:32:08.501
SHERRY TURKLE: In
"Reclaiming Conversation"

00:32:08.501 --> 00:32:12.060
I talk a lot about TV, because
we've all experienced TV.

00:32:12.060 --> 00:32:15.540
And it's very important
not to get into, well,

00:32:15.540 --> 00:32:17.370
we're talking about
the latest technology,

00:32:17.370 --> 00:32:19.970
and then we're just
upset about this one

00:32:19.970 --> 00:32:22.520
because it's the one we have
now, and we were upset about TV

00:32:22.520 --> 00:32:25.210
when that was the thing.

00:32:25.210 --> 00:32:27.590
The reason I'm
on-- I was a big--

00:32:27.590 --> 00:32:29.300
I don't want to
say computer diva,

00:32:29.300 --> 00:32:31.420
because that would
be a little much,

00:32:31.420 --> 00:32:33.960
but I was on the cover
of, believe it or not,

00:32:33.960 --> 00:32:36.920
"Wired" magazine for being a
kind of booster of this tech--

00:32:36.920 --> 00:32:39.840
it seems like very early
days, but in fact, it was true

00:32:39.840 --> 00:32:42.560
that I was an enthusiast.

00:32:42.560 --> 00:32:44.070
And the difference between--

00:32:44.070 --> 00:32:45.650
So before I answer
your question,

00:32:45.650 --> 00:32:53.220
what this device has that other
devices don't-- TV, anything--

00:32:53.220 --> 00:32:56.680
the uniqueness of this
device is the always-on,

00:32:56.680 --> 00:33:02.360
always-on-you property,
where every interaction

00:33:02.360 --> 00:33:08.870
you're in, like your baby--
being with your baby.

00:33:08.870 --> 00:33:12.410
There are potty trainers that
have a slot for the iPad.

00:33:12.410 --> 00:33:15.800
There are baby bouncers
with a slot for the iPad.

00:33:15.800 --> 00:33:21.040
And to me, those
signify our willingness

00:33:21.040 --> 00:33:24.780
to interrupt every
time that, normally, we

00:33:24.780 --> 00:33:28.550
would be thinking of the
human gaze and the human talk

00:33:28.550 --> 00:33:36.250
to a baby, which is built into
us as what the baby needs, as

00:33:36.250 --> 00:33:38.550
potentially broken by a screen.

00:33:38.550 --> 00:33:40.970
So the fact of those
objects in the culture

00:33:40.970 --> 00:33:43.360
are symptoms of the
fact that we have

00:33:43.360 --> 00:33:46.150
gotten so used to this
always-on, always-on-you

00:33:46.150 --> 00:33:48.460
situation.

00:33:48.460 --> 00:33:50.540
I grew up with a television.

00:33:50.540 --> 00:33:53.991
My family sat around it and we
all talked to the television.

00:33:53.991 --> 00:33:55.740
There was this program,
"I Remember Mama,"

00:33:55.740 --> 00:33:58.350
on the television about
an immigrant family.

00:33:58.350 --> 00:34:00.890
And we all fought
with the television

00:34:00.890 --> 00:34:03.150
about what that family did,
and how our family would

00:34:03.150 --> 00:34:05.147
have done it
differently, and how

00:34:05.147 --> 00:34:06.730
they are making big
mistakes, and what

00:34:06.730 --> 00:34:08.389
they're doing with their money.

00:34:08.389 --> 00:34:10.940
Television didn't
have to be isolating.

00:34:10.940 --> 00:34:13.070
It could be isolating.

00:34:13.070 --> 00:34:19.179
We have to find a way to make
our current technologies less

00:34:19.179 --> 00:34:22.000
isolating.

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:25.489
So television is a
perfect example for me

00:34:25.489 --> 00:34:29.159
of how it's not the object.

00:34:29.159 --> 00:34:32.530
It's the designing
for vulnerability

00:34:32.530 --> 00:34:34.230
around the object.

00:34:34.230 --> 00:34:39.960
We are vulnerable to certain
kinds of uses of our phones

00:34:39.960 --> 00:34:44.510
that are not really nurturing
of us as individuals

00:34:44.510 --> 00:34:46.010
and a collective.

00:34:46.010 --> 00:34:49.540
And we have to design
around that vulnerability

00:34:49.540 --> 00:34:51.139
to make that
relationship better.

00:34:51.139 --> 00:34:52.630
That's how I see it.

00:34:52.630 --> 00:34:54.920
But I don't know about
television modeling

00:34:54.920 --> 00:34:56.780
empathy and now our
troubles with empathy.

00:34:56.780 --> 00:34:58.005
I have to think about that.

00:34:58.005 --> 00:34:59.870
[CHUCKLING]

00:34:59.870 --> 00:35:01.630
I'll get back to you.

00:35:01.630 --> 00:35:04.510
We'll talk more about that.

00:35:04.510 --> 00:35:07.997
The idea that not enough
television is the root of this

00:35:07.997 --> 00:35:08.580
is something--

00:35:08.580 --> 00:35:09.446
[CHUCKLING]

00:35:09.446 --> 00:35:11.830
I have to admit,
that's a toughie.

00:35:14.550 --> 00:35:19.050
AUDIENCE: Your work is on the
level of peer interaction,

00:35:19.050 --> 00:35:23.430
and it's very fascinating
and frightening to me, both.

00:35:23.430 --> 00:35:26.610
I wanted to ask you about
two areas that are related

00:35:26.610 --> 00:35:30.510
but are on a kind of
a different scale.

00:35:30.510 --> 00:35:33.820
Twenty years ago Robert
Putnam wrote "Bowling Alone"

00:35:33.820 --> 00:35:39.380
about the decline of civic
participation in society.

00:35:39.380 --> 00:35:42.970
He wrote that between
1995 and 2000.

00:35:42.970 --> 00:35:46.520
He was looking back to 1950.

00:35:46.520 --> 00:35:48.540
He's talking about
the decline of voting,

00:35:48.540 --> 00:35:51.530
of civic organizations, even
things like bowling leagues--

00:35:51.530 --> 00:35:53.650
hence the title of the book.

00:35:53.650 --> 00:35:55.280
And clearly there
are a lot of things

00:35:55.280 --> 00:35:58.300
that play into this,
including residential mobility

00:35:58.300 --> 00:35:59.520
and all kinds of stuff.

00:35:59.520 --> 00:36:03.940
But he did, in fact, link
it to technology-- notably,

00:36:03.940 --> 00:36:07.380
TV, the rise of TV,
and later the Internet,

00:36:07.380 --> 00:36:09.170
over that whole period.

00:36:09.170 --> 00:36:12.490
I'm just wondering-- I know you
didn't directly study things

00:36:12.490 --> 00:36:14.854
like wider organizations.

00:36:14.854 --> 00:36:17.270
But I'm wondering if you have
any thoughts about whether--

00:36:17.270 --> 00:36:17.440
SHERRY TURKLE: Yes.

00:36:17.440 --> 00:36:19.190
AUDIENCE: --this might
be related to that.

00:36:19.190 --> 00:36:20.190
That's number one.

00:36:20.190 --> 00:36:24.710
And number two, a slightly
different sort of thing.

00:36:24.710 --> 00:36:26.140
I wonder if you
have any thoughts

00:36:26.140 --> 00:36:29.110
about whether this kind
of trend is, in any way,

00:36:29.110 --> 00:36:34.290
related to the recent huge
increase in diagnosis of autism

00:36:34.290 --> 00:36:36.590
and autistic disorders.

00:36:36.590 --> 00:36:39.310
SHERRY TURKLE: Well, let
me take the second first.

00:36:39.310 --> 00:36:46.070
I'm not an autism expert,
so I say this bracketed

00:36:46.070 --> 00:36:47.750
with that disclaimer.

00:36:47.750 --> 00:36:52.420
But I know for a fact that in
the schools that I was studying

00:36:52.420 --> 00:36:57.740
that were specifically not
schools for children who

00:36:57.740 --> 00:37:03.630
had developmental disorders
or autism or on the spectrum,

00:37:03.630 --> 00:37:08.730
children were not looking
at each other in the eye,

00:37:08.730 --> 00:37:11.790
were having conversations
with their heads down,

00:37:11.790 --> 00:37:15.530
did not show empathy
towards the other children.

00:37:15.530 --> 00:37:17.520
In one case I
report in the book,

00:37:17.520 --> 00:37:25.010
again, in a school that is not
for children on the spectrum,

00:37:25.010 --> 00:37:28.090
one child's father
had committed suicide,

00:37:28.090 --> 00:37:31.500
and another girl
says to him, I hope

00:37:31.500 --> 00:37:34.160
you go the way of
your dad, when she

00:37:34.160 --> 00:37:36.810
wanted to talk to his sister
more in the lunch room,

00:37:36.810 --> 00:37:41.230
and-- honestly, a
13-year-old fight.

00:37:41.230 --> 00:37:45.530
And when the headmaster tries
to talk to her about this,

00:37:45.530 --> 00:37:50.360
he said to me, his goal
was to make that girl cry.

00:37:50.360 --> 00:37:52.880
[CHUCKLING] And then he
had to call her mother

00:37:52.880 --> 00:37:55.940
to explain why she
came home in tears.

00:37:55.940 --> 00:38:02.080
To try to get her head into
the head of this other kid,

00:38:02.080 --> 00:38:03.630
he said it was
almost impossible.

00:38:03.630 --> 00:38:07.640
In other words, you have
children acting as though they

00:38:07.640 --> 00:38:09.550
were on the spectrum.

00:38:09.550 --> 00:38:15.330
And in the camps where
children go and have a summer

00:38:15.330 --> 00:38:17.280
without phones,
one of the things

00:38:17.280 --> 00:38:20.180
the counsellors note
is that children

00:38:20.180 --> 00:38:23.670
come in kind of
heads-down, not talking,

00:38:23.670 --> 00:38:26.610
having a very hard time
relating to other kids.

00:38:26.610 --> 00:38:28.800
And by the end of the
summer-- it's often

00:38:28.800 --> 00:38:36.070
as long as a 10-week or 12-week
session, they're better.

00:38:36.070 --> 00:38:40.150
So I fear that
we're misdiagnosing

00:38:40.150 --> 00:38:45.280
kids who really have a different
kind of disorder, which

00:38:45.280 --> 00:38:49.200
is that they're out of
a kind of practice--

00:38:49.200 --> 00:38:51.090
and I mean this quite
literally-- they're out

00:38:51.090 --> 00:38:56.800
of a kind of practice
of needing to deal

00:38:56.800 --> 00:39:00.630
with the complexities
of a conversation.

00:39:00.630 --> 00:39:03.420
And we're diagnosing
them, perhaps,

00:39:03.420 --> 00:39:08.590
as on the spectrum, when
really they need the talking

00:39:08.590 --> 00:39:12.180
cure, because--

00:39:12.180 --> 00:39:15.260
I'll tell you just
one piece of this.

00:39:15.260 --> 00:39:17.160
Children don't apologize.

00:39:17.160 --> 00:39:20.110
They type, "I'm sorry,"
and they hit Send.

00:39:20.110 --> 00:39:23.070
And the elements of
an apology, which

00:39:23.070 --> 00:39:28.190
is looking you in the eye,
seeing that you were hurt,

00:39:28.190 --> 00:39:33.380
your seeing that I'm upset
that I see that you're hurt,

00:39:33.380 --> 00:39:37.430
you feeling compassionate
because you see that I'm upset,

00:39:37.430 --> 00:39:40.200
my saying, oh, my god,
he looks compassionate,

00:39:40.200 --> 00:39:42.410
maybe there's a chance
for me, and you're

00:39:42.410 --> 00:39:44.590
seeing that I want to
take that chance-- this

00:39:44.590 --> 00:39:47.530
is a very, very
complicated dance.

00:39:47.530 --> 00:39:49.460
And this is how empathy is born.

00:39:49.460 --> 00:39:52.560
We're doing all of
this-- putting each other

00:39:52.560 --> 00:39:55.220
in the turn of the other.

00:39:55.220 --> 00:39:59.910
"I'm sorry" and hitting
Send does none of this work.

00:39:59.910 --> 00:40:04.930
So I'm saying that I have a lot
of optimism in just giving kids

00:40:04.930 --> 00:40:07.960
more of an opportunity-- and
this is where I'm going to get

00:40:07.960 --> 00:40:10.740
back to Robert Putnam-- when
you're not sending a kid out

00:40:10.740 --> 00:40:14.720
on the street, when he's not
part of that Boy Scout troop,

00:40:14.720 --> 00:40:17.350
or that after-school thing, or
that Little League, or that--

00:40:17.350 --> 00:40:20.424
I recently had a reunion.

00:40:20.424 --> 00:40:22.090
One lovely thing about
getting your book

00:40:22.090 --> 00:40:24.380
reviewed in the "New York
Times" is all of a sudden

00:40:24.380 --> 00:40:27.200
you're meeting people you
went to kindergarten with.

00:40:27.200 --> 00:40:29.560
It's like, oh, my god, Sherry.

00:40:29.560 --> 00:40:31.520
I can go to your book signing.

00:40:31.520 --> 00:40:32.950
I went to kindergarten with you.

00:40:32.950 --> 00:40:35.250
So I'm having all these
wonderful reunions,

00:40:35.250 --> 00:40:37.820
and we're all talking
about how much time we

00:40:37.820 --> 00:40:39.590
spent on the street.

00:40:39.590 --> 00:40:41.190
It was in Brooklyn.

00:40:41.190 --> 00:40:43.440
This is pre-"Bowling Alone."

00:40:43.440 --> 00:40:45.400
We bowled together--
we didn't bowl--

00:40:45.400 --> 00:40:48.420
we played other games,
hopscotch or tag,

00:40:48.420 --> 00:40:52.990
but we were on the street
and all of those interactions

00:40:52.990 --> 00:40:55.700
were part of communities
where people were constantly

00:40:55.700 --> 00:40:57.490
negotiating, where
kids were constantly

00:40:57.490 --> 00:40:58.650
learning these skills.

00:40:58.650 --> 00:41:05.200
So I see my work as the
human side, the micro side,

00:41:05.200 --> 00:41:07.920
the personal side, the
opening up the door

00:41:07.920 --> 00:41:12.240
of the home side of what
Robert Putnam is talking about.

00:41:12.240 --> 00:41:15.360
So I feel very close
to the work of Putnam

00:41:15.360 --> 00:41:18.510
and other people like him, who
were talking about the macro,

00:41:18.510 --> 00:41:22.220
whereas my work focuses
more on the micro.

00:41:22.220 --> 00:41:24.020
Yeah.

00:41:24.020 --> 00:41:26.460
AUDIENCE: Good morning.

00:41:26.460 --> 00:41:29.450
I love what technology is
doing in schools right now,

00:41:29.450 --> 00:41:31.880
for the most part, in terms
of enabling collaboration

00:41:31.880 --> 00:41:35.670
between students and
things like that.

00:41:35.670 --> 00:41:37.122
But it's the same.

00:41:37.122 --> 00:41:37.705
It's the same.

00:41:37.705 --> 00:41:41.970
A lot of the same opportunities
for avoidance and being

00:41:41.970 --> 00:41:44.500
alone are created
with the screens.

00:41:44.500 --> 00:41:47.230
So talk a little
bit about what you

00:41:47.230 --> 00:41:52.330
think schools might need to do,
or could do, to help mitigate

00:41:52.330 --> 00:41:55.621
against pushing us faster down
the path you're talking about,

00:41:55.621 --> 00:41:56.120
number one.

00:41:56.120 --> 00:41:59.770
And number two, have you heard
from, maybe, corporations

00:41:59.770 --> 00:42:03.050
at all around the
training implications

00:42:03.050 --> 00:42:05.420
for this for
communications, particularly

00:42:05.420 --> 00:42:08.340
in a selling environment?

00:42:08.340 --> 00:42:12.730
You go to a-- I'm a
sales leader here.

00:42:12.730 --> 00:42:16.350
Everyone has a device
or two or three

00:42:16.350 --> 00:42:17.650
at every meeting you go to.

00:42:17.650 --> 00:42:19.700
So from what you've
described, that

00:42:19.700 --> 00:42:24.020
means that automatically empathy
has gone from the meeting,

00:42:24.020 --> 00:42:27.447
and empathy is a key
part in salesmanship.

00:42:27.447 --> 00:42:29.530
So if you could talk about
that for a minute, too.

00:42:29.530 --> 00:42:30.620
SHERRY TURKLE: Well,
let me start with that.

00:42:30.620 --> 00:42:31.000
AUDIENCE: And how do you
feel about corporations?

00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:33.870
SHERRY TURKLE: There's a great
chapter in my book on business.

00:42:33.870 --> 00:42:42.420
And [CHUCKLING] my favorite
story is a guy who says,

00:42:42.420 --> 00:42:49.910
I cannot close the deal
unless I have a conversation.

00:42:49.910 --> 00:42:54.950
And I cannot tell you how
many times, he tells me,

00:42:54.950 --> 00:42:59.780
that I will send out an email
and they'll want to send me

00:42:59.780 --> 00:43:01.360
an email back.

00:43:01.360 --> 00:43:05.040
And I know that I need
to see this person.

00:43:05.040 --> 00:43:10.170
I need to have his device away,
for me to close this deal.

00:43:10.170 --> 00:43:17.100
And I have to work so hard to
get him at least on the phone,

00:43:17.100 --> 00:43:22.210
or hopefully face to face, to
really make the money I need.

00:43:22.210 --> 00:43:24.750
Or people talk at
length about people

00:43:24.750 --> 00:43:27.810
who just want to send emails
back and forth instead

00:43:27.810 --> 00:43:31.050
of really dealing
with a problem,

00:43:31.050 --> 00:43:36.060
or the struggle to
get the highest levels

00:43:36.060 --> 00:43:40.060
to put their devices away
during very important meetings.

00:43:40.060 --> 00:43:45.340
And I'm seeing a big
shift in willingness

00:43:45.340 --> 00:43:50.980
to start to force people
to put their devices away,

00:43:50.980 --> 00:43:56.700
because, really, to get things
done you need full attention.

00:43:56.700 --> 00:43:58.990
So I think we're
just at the cusp.

00:43:58.990 --> 00:44:03.629
I want this project to be
part of-- no one book changes

00:44:03.629 --> 00:44:06.170
people's-- I don't expect you
guys to read this book and say,

00:44:06.170 --> 00:44:08.970
ah, now my mind is
changed completely.

00:44:08.970 --> 00:44:14.290
But I think I've
assembled a lot of data

00:44:14.290 --> 00:44:18.820
that should start a good
conversation about phones

00:44:18.820 --> 00:44:19.860
and business.

00:44:19.860 --> 00:44:24.110
I know in my work setting,
five years ago professors were,

00:44:24.110 --> 00:44:26.170
I am not anybody's nanny.

00:44:26.170 --> 00:44:27.980
I don't want to be
anybody's nanny.

00:44:27.980 --> 00:44:28.970
You come to class.

00:44:28.970 --> 00:44:30.560
You do whatever you want.

00:44:30.560 --> 00:44:31.870
I'm nobody's nanny.

00:44:31.870 --> 00:44:33.990
And now, with all
the new data that

00:44:33.990 --> 00:44:38.120
is in about how one open
laptop not only destroys

00:44:38.120 --> 00:44:40.380
the attention of the person
with the open laptop,

00:44:40.380 --> 00:44:45.940
but a kind of circle around
that person, we have baskets.

00:44:45.940 --> 00:44:49.630
And we say, put the phone and
put the laptop in the basket

00:44:49.630 --> 00:44:51.010
and then come into class.

00:44:51.010 --> 00:44:55.472
Professors now have a totally
different attitude about this.

00:44:55.472 --> 00:44:57.430
There's a story in the
book about Carol Steiker

00:44:57.430 --> 00:45:00.210
at the Harvard Business
School who, five years ago,

00:45:00.210 --> 00:45:02.552
six years ago, had everybody
taking notes on laptops.

00:45:02.552 --> 00:45:03.760
She thought that was the way.

00:45:03.760 --> 00:45:06.570
OK, sure, that's
how people write.

00:45:06.570 --> 00:45:09.970
And then, she says
that she found

00:45:09.970 --> 00:45:13.320
that when they had
their laptops open,

00:45:13.320 --> 00:45:15.806
people were
transcribing the class.

00:45:15.806 --> 00:45:18.180
They weren't integrating what
was happening in the class.

00:45:18.180 --> 00:45:21.040
They were doing like they were
court stenographers in her law

00:45:21.040 --> 00:45:22.940
school class at Harvard.

00:45:22.940 --> 00:45:26.520
So then one day, one of
the students was sick.

00:45:26.520 --> 00:45:28.990
She was in the hospital, and
different members of the class

00:45:28.990 --> 00:45:32.330
had offered to take
notes for this sick girl.

00:45:32.330 --> 00:45:34.000
And a student comes
up to her and says,

00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:36.540
Professor Steiker, I need
to have your notes today

00:45:36.540 --> 00:45:39.940
because my power was lost.

00:45:39.940 --> 00:45:41.560
I didn't have a power cord.

00:45:41.560 --> 00:45:44.200
And she said, well, why
didn't you take notes by hand?

00:45:44.200 --> 00:45:46.500
And she said, well,
I couldn't do that.

00:45:46.500 --> 00:45:49.460
I couldn't get it all down
if I took notes by hand.

00:45:49.460 --> 00:45:52.490
So the whole thing that she
wants her students to do,

00:45:52.490 --> 00:45:56.900
which is to integrate, which
is to integrate what you hear

00:45:56.900 --> 00:46:01.510
and make sense of it for you,
which you can do by hand--

00:46:01.510 --> 00:46:05.320
this student was not
even on the program

00:46:05.320 --> 00:46:06.990
that she would even
think of doing that.

00:46:06.990 --> 00:46:09.490
All she knows how to do is take
everything down on a laptop.

00:46:09.490 --> 00:46:11.031
And that's the day
that Steiker said,

00:46:11.031 --> 00:46:12.930
no more computers in class.

00:46:12.930 --> 00:46:17.510
So to your point about
schools, I go into classrooms

00:46:17.510 --> 00:46:20.070
and students are just
using these devices

00:46:20.070 --> 00:46:26.320
in ways that are
fantastic, mind-blowing.

00:46:26.320 --> 00:46:29.240
And there's a lot of use
of these computers in ways

00:46:29.240 --> 00:46:31.750
that are mind-deadening.

00:46:31.750 --> 00:46:35.480
And now it's our job
to sort this through.

00:46:35.480 --> 00:46:39.180
And it's a big job, because
there-- some of the most

00:46:39.180 --> 00:46:41.660
hysterical stories
in my book, I think--

00:46:41.660 --> 00:46:44.340
are students who print
out their reading

00:46:44.340 --> 00:46:47.090
assignments, because it's
too distracting to read them

00:46:47.090 --> 00:46:49.930
on the computer that
their school gave them,

00:46:49.930 --> 00:46:53.150
because they're too tempted
to look at other things

00:46:53.150 --> 00:46:54.960
and let their minds wander.

00:46:54.960 --> 00:46:56.860
So that's what you don't want.

00:46:56.860 --> 00:47:00.380
So it's not enough to just
put the computers in class.

00:47:00.380 --> 00:47:02.580
Now it's the second generation.

00:47:02.580 --> 00:47:07.220
We all have to get very
vigilant about the culture

00:47:07.220 --> 00:47:09.140
of the classroom
that we use them in.

00:47:09.140 --> 00:47:11.610
And I really think
schools should not

00:47:11.610 --> 00:47:13.270
close their libraries.

00:47:13.270 --> 00:47:15.820
Very, very bad choice.

00:47:15.820 --> 00:47:16.760
Very bad choice.

00:47:16.760 --> 00:47:20.070
Putting everything on the
machine and thinking libraries

00:47:20.070 --> 00:47:24.460
are gone-- very bad choice.

00:47:24.460 --> 00:47:25.590
Is that my phone?

00:47:25.590 --> 00:47:30.020
[LAUGHTER] My
daughter, who works

00:47:30.020 --> 00:47:35.510
for LinkedIn-- God telling
me something-- she's 24,

00:47:35.510 --> 00:47:40.050
she works for LinkedIn, says
that only someone over 40

00:47:40.050 --> 00:47:43.820
ever forgets to turn
off their phone.

00:47:43.820 --> 00:47:44.853
That's very funny.

00:47:44.853 --> 00:47:45.352
Yes.

00:47:47.655 --> 00:47:48.196
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:47:48.196 --> 00:47:50.850
How do you deal with the idea
that more and more time being

00:47:50.850 --> 00:47:54.660
spent on devices is being
used to be more productive?

00:47:54.660 --> 00:47:57.020
Be it emails or
reading articles,

00:47:57.020 --> 00:47:59.870
or-- because the Internet
has so much information.

00:47:59.870 --> 00:48:02.290
So all the additional
time that is

00:48:02.290 --> 00:48:04.140
being used to spend
on devices is being

00:48:04.140 --> 00:48:05.662
used to be more productive.

00:48:05.662 --> 00:48:09.030
And any time that
is spent in solitude

00:48:09.030 --> 00:48:12.700
is sort of wasted
time, or so to speak.

00:48:12.700 --> 00:48:16.776
SHERRY TURKLE: Well,
I honor your question.

00:48:16.776 --> 00:48:18.490
[CHUCKLING]

00:48:18.490 --> 00:48:22.170
And how can I say it in
the nicest possible way?

00:48:22.170 --> 00:48:24.270
The premise is wrong.

00:48:24.270 --> 00:48:29.090
The premise that time in
solitude reading email

00:48:29.090 --> 00:48:34.840
is, without any
further qualifier,

00:48:34.840 --> 00:48:38.780
the most productive way you
could be spending your time,

00:48:38.780 --> 00:48:41.540
is part of what we have to
examine, because it turns out

00:48:41.540 --> 00:48:43.360
not to be true.

00:48:43.360 --> 00:48:47.720
And the premise that time
and solitude, getting

00:48:47.720 --> 00:48:53.870
more information online,
is the most productive way

00:48:53.870 --> 00:48:58.280
to be spending your time
instead of, for example--

00:48:58.280 --> 00:49:00.010
and it just may
sound crazy to you,

00:49:00.010 --> 00:49:02.280
but it's by hearing
something that sounds crazy

00:49:02.280 --> 00:49:04.550
that you say oh, let me
think about this crazy thing

00:49:04.550 --> 00:49:09.320
and let me entertain this
idea-- mind wandering,

00:49:09.320 --> 00:49:11.590
letting your
imagination wander--

00:49:11.590 --> 00:49:13.090
we're terrified of that idea.

00:49:13.090 --> 00:49:16.090
People are like, I want
to stay with my computer.

00:49:16.090 --> 00:49:18.710
I want to stay on my machine.

00:49:18.710 --> 00:49:23.640
We now have a device that lets
us do that and lets us feel

00:49:23.640 --> 00:49:24.980
that we're always productive.

00:49:24.980 --> 00:49:26.780
That's why we want to be at it.

00:49:26.780 --> 00:49:30.470
I mean, we wouldn't
be having this problem

00:49:30.470 --> 00:49:34.390
if this thing didn't
seduce us with the promise

00:49:34.390 --> 00:49:37.370
that we're more productive
when we're at it.

00:49:37.370 --> 00:49:41.610
So that's why I'm so
sympathetic with your premise,

00:49:41.610 --> 00:49:44.490
because that's how we
feel when we're with it.

00:49:44.490 --> 00:49:47.360
I sometimes say it makes us
three promises, like gifts

00:49:47.360 --> 00:49:48.570
of a benevolent fairy.

00:49:48.570 --> 00:49:51.110
You will always be productive.

00:49:51.110 --> 00:49:55.450
You can let your imagination
go wherever it wants to go.

00:49:55.450 --> 00:49:56.560
You will always be heard.

00:49:56.560 --> 00:49:58.430
You will never be bored.

00:49:58.430 --> 00:50:00.400
And now you'll
always be productive.

00:50:00.400 --> 00:50:02.230
You'll never be wasting time.

00:50:02.230 --> 00:50:03.050
You'll never--

00:50:03.050 --> 00:50:09.100
It just turns out that
it's like multi-tasking.

00:50:09.100 --> 00:50:12.530
The great studies of
multi-tasking by Clifford Nass,

00:50:12.530 --> 00:50:14.120
who tragically died
a few years ago,

00:50:14.120 --> 00:50:16.725
showed that when
people multi-task,

00:50:16.725 --> 00:50:19.100
they feel like they're doing
better and better and better

00:50:19.100 --> 00:50:22.710
and better for
every task they add,

00:50:22.710 --> 00:50:25.970
when in fact they're
doing worse and worse.

00:50:25.970 --> 00:50:28.400
Every task they add,
they feel they're

00:50:28.400 --> 00:50:30.250
doing better at every task.

00:50:30.250 --> 00:50:32.650
And, in fact, they're
doing worse at every task.

00:50:32.650 --> 00:50:34.970
And we have to force
ourselves to reconsider

00:50:34.970 --> 00:50:38.720
that that extra
time at our email

00:50:38.720 --> 00:50:42.450
is not time that's really the
most productive and the most

00:50:42.450 --> 00:50:43.270
collaborative.

00:50:43.270 --> 00:50:49.460
That's why I do case
studies of companies where,

00:50:49.460 --> 00:50:55.920
instead of allowing for
conversation and collaboration,

00:50:55.920 --> 00:51:00.330
the value of the company is to
keep everybody at their screen.

00:51:00.330 --> 00:51:04.300
And they're losing
out, even though they

00:51:04.300 --> 00:51:06.310
are stating that
really what they want

00:51:06.310 --> 00:51:08.580
is people talking
and collaborating,

00:51:08.580 --> 00:51:11.060
because the pressure
to stay at your screen

00:51:11.060 --> 00:51:13.450
is such an important part
of the company culture.

00:51:13.450 --> 00:51:15.170
So when somebody
asked about do I

00:51:15.170 --> 00:51:17.400
want to have an
impact on businesses,

00:51:17.400 --> 00:51:19.790
if I had one impact
on business, that

00:51:19.790 --> 00:51:22.830
would be the conversation I
would want to start, I think.

00:51:22.830 --> 00:51:24.000
Yeah.

00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:24.760
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:51:24.760 --> 00:51:28.820
I was curious about, when you
were talking about resilience,

00:51:28.820 --> 00:51:34.180
of that just a bit of time away
helps rebuild that empathy.

00:51:34.180 --> 00:51:35.900
And it's particularly
interesting to me

00:51:35.900 --> 00:51:37.020
because I keep Shabbat.

00:51:37.020 --> 00:51:40.080
So from Friday afternoon
till Saturday night, my phone

00:51:40.080 --> 00:51:43.427
is off-- no exceptions,
no computer, no nothing.

00:51:43.427 --> 00:51:45.510
And the community of people
that I'm friends with,

00:51:45.510 --> 00:51:48.900
and that I spend that time with,
also have their phones off.

00:51:48.900 --> 00:51:52.080
And I enjoy it.

00:51:52.080 --> 00:51:56.040
And I'm curious if there's
been any studies, either

00:51:56.040 --> 00:51:59.180
examining the effect within
that sort of community,

00:51:59.180 --> 00:52:02.190
but also, I would imagine
that that information would

00:52:02.190 --> 00:52:04.900
be very useful
applying outwards--

00:52:04.900 --> 00:52:07.680
of what sort of
techniques are useful

00:52:07.680 --> 00:52:11.420
and how much time away
has an effect on empathy

00:52:11.420 --> 00:52:12.330
and community.

00:52:12.330 --> 00:52:14.950
SHERRY TURKLE: Well,
actually there's

00:52:14.950 --> 00:52:19.010
a large community of
people who are working

00:52:19.010 --> 00:52:26.770
on the notion of
a digital Shabbat,

00:52:26.770 --> 00:52:29.325
not necessarily making
it a religious practice--

00:52:29.325 --> 00:52:30.080
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:52:30.080 --> 00:52:32.205
SHERRY TURKLE: --but sort
of using that experience.

00:52:32.205 --> 00:52:36.720
And many people find that
the 24 hours turns out

00:52:36.720 --> 00:52:42.420
to be almost ideal--
an ideal time.

00:52:42.420 --> 00:52:53.190
Others find that taking three
hours a night is perfect.

00:52:53.190 --> 00:53:00.280
So what people have shown
is that there are many ways

00:53:00.280 --> 00:53:05.310
to do it, and that what makes
most sense for the beginning

00:53:05.310 --> 00:53:09.690
is for people to tune
in to their own family

00:53:09.690 --> 00:53:15.460
lives and their own stories.

00:53:15.460 --> 00:53:19.560
But certainly, the one
day, once a week is ideal.

00:53:19.560 --> 00:53:22.940
Many families take a
one-and-a-half-day vacation,

00:53:22.940 --> 00:53:26.350
where they literally go
to a different place where

00:53:26.350 --> 00:53:30.300
there's no Internet, where
they do things together.

00:53:30.300 --> 00:53:33.512
The part in the studies
that were done-- I'm

00:53:33.512 --> 00:53:34.970
forgetting the name
of the company.

00:53:34.970 --> 00:53:36.700
It's a large consulting company.

00:53:36.700 --> 00:53:37.750
It's public information.

00:53:37.750 --> 00:53:38.892
It'll come back to me.

00:53:38.892 --> 00:53:39.600
I write about it.

00:53:39.600 --> 00:53:42.680
They do something called
predictable time off,

00:53:42.680 --> 00:53:45.330
where they gave people
only one night a week.

00:53:45.330 --> 00:53:47.160
But what you mentioned
was very important.

00:53:47.160 --> 00:53:49.860
You're in a community of
people that talks about it.

00:53:49.860 --> 00:53:52.750
And they didn't only give
people one night a week

00:53:52.750 --> 00:53:56.180
where they said, you don't
have to be on your phone.

00:53:56.180 --> 00:53:59.910
But they had people talk
about that experience

00:53:59.910 --> 00:54:00.890
when they came to work.

00:54:00.890 --> 00:54:02.880
And they gave them
support at work,

00:54:02.880 --> 00:54:06.150
more support perhaps than other
workers had about the stresses

00:54:06.150 --> 00:54:07.950
of the always-on life.

00:54:07.950 --> 00:54:12.700
And many people think that what
is helpful about the Shabbat

00:54:12.700 --> 00:54:16.130
is that so many people who
are taking that Shabbat,

00:54:16.130 --> 00:54:18.010
they're not just
taking that Shabbat

00:54:18.010 --> 00:54:20.660
but they are taking that
Shabbat and they're also

00:54:20.660 --> 00:54:23.730
in community with other people,
which is why it makes it harder

00:54:23.730 --> 00:54:27.600
to study your experience,
and make it seem like,

00:54:27.600 --> 00:54:29.490
oh, well, we'll just
apply this to everybody

00:54:29.490 --> 00:54:33.350
and that was the right
recipe for digital detox.

00:54:33.350 --> 00:54:37.330
You're having a
combination of no digital,

00:54:37.330 --> 00:54:40.490
but then an extraordinary
group community experience.

00:54:40.490 --> 00:54:42.540
But I think people are
trying different things.

00:54:42.540 --> 00:54:44.895
It makes sense-- different
people in different ways.

00:54:44.895 --> 00:54:45.520
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:54:45.520 --> 00:54:47.210
Thank you.

00:54:47.210 --> 00:54:49.610
AUDIENCE: I liked
your term "seduction."

00:54:49.610 --> 00:54:52.200
It's very easy to
get on and stay on,

00:54:52.200 --> 00:54:57.560
even though there is no
reason to-- to say, well,

00:54:57.560 --> 00:55:00.510
it's the easy thing to
do, just to stay on here.

00:55:00.510 --> 00:55:03.530
My question, I
guess, is, is there

00:55:03.530 --> 00:55:09.880
some way to use these tools
more intentionally, as you say?

00:55:09.880 --> 00:55:11.020
Facebook, for example.

00:55:11.020 --> 00:55:13.137
My kindergarten
friends-- sometimes

00:55:13.137 --> 00:55:14.220
I do see them on Facebook.

00:55:14.220 --> 00:55:16.650
I say, well, I had no idea
you were in California.

00:55:16.650 --> 00:55:20.080
What have you been doing
for the last 50 years?

00:55:20.080 --> 00:55:21.090
Or more, actually.

00:55:21.090 --> 00:55:27.092
But so-- but on the
other hand, realizing

00:55:27.092 --> 00:55:28.800
that I've just spent
an hour on Facebook,

00:55:28.800 --> 00:55:30.425
I say, what the hell
have I been doing?

00:55:30.425 --> 00:55:31.510
Right?

00:55:31.510 --> 00:55:33.750
Is there some way to
use tools like that

00:55:33.750 --> 00:55:36.839
more effectively,
more intentionally?

00:55:36.839 --> 00:55:37.630
SHERRY TURKLE: Yes.

00:55:37.630 --> 00:55:46.170
But I'm not sure that-- but
again, what is your intention?

00:55:46.170 --> 00:55:48.740
I think we have to
figure out if-- I now

00:55:48.740 --> 00:55:53.209
have an intention
that I actually like.

00:55:53.209 --> 00:55:55.000
I've learned from this
tour that I actually

00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:58.830
like connecting with
the people I knew

00:55:58.830 --> 00:56:01.220
when I was a kid in Brooklyn.

00:56:01.220 --> 00:56:03.440
So when I'm on
Facebook now, I'm not

00:56:03.440 --> 00:56:05.660
wandering the plains
of Facebook just

00:56:05.660 --> 00:56:09.530
hoping that somebody
will like me.

00:56:09.530 --> 00:56:13.330
I actually-- if I
spend some time there,

00:56:13.330 --> 00:56:16.050
I actually feel
motivated to look

00:56:16.050 --> 00:56:20.510
for the people who were on the
masthead of the "Lincoln Log"

00:56:20.510 --> 00:56:23.340
at Abraham Lincoln High
School in Brooklyn.

00:56:23.340 --> 00:56:28.910
I feel that is joyful
and positive time online.

00:56:28.910 --> 00:56:31.750
So that's behavior
with intention.

00:56:31.750 --> 00:56:33.980
I think the issue is
behavior with intention.

00:56:33.980 --> 00:56:36.840
When you're on the Internet
with behavior with intention,

00:56:36.840 --> 00:56:40.380
what's not to like?

00:56:40.380 --> 00:56:43.370
If students in our
classes actually

00:56:43.370 --> 00:56:46.830
looked up something that was
crucial to the discussion,

00:56:46.830 --> 00:56:48.440
brought it to the
class and said,

00:56:48.440 --> 00:56:52.010
my god, here's the thing that's
crucial to the discussion,

00:56:52.010 --> 00:56:55.734
and then that was the end
of it, that would be fine.

00:56:55.734 --> 00:56:56.900
But that's not what happens.

00:56:56.900 --> 00:56:59.500
They look it up, and
then they see a message

00:56:59.500 --> 00:57:01.800
and then go-- as
one of my students

00:57:01.800 --> 00:57:05.660
says, I can't bear not
to see who wants me,

00:57:05.660 --> 00:57:07.290
when she sees a
message from Facebook.

00:57:07.290 --> 00:57:08.640
And that's what it's about.

00:57:08.640 --> 00:57:10.569
We all want to see
who wants us there.

00:57:10.569 --> 00:57:12.610
So you go to Facebook,
and then once you're there

00:57:12.610 --> 00:57:15.830
you see an ad, and
then we have the trail,

00:57:15.830 --> 00:57:18.260
and then you're
buying REI sportswear.

00:57:18.260 --> 00:57:20.360
I mean that's the
sort of MIT trail,

00:57:20.360 --> 00:57:27.570
from the factoid to the "who
wants me?" to the shoes--

00:57:27.570 --> 00:57:28.700
to the hiking shoes.

00:57:28.700 --> 00:57:31.610
So I think that the notion
of acting with intention

00:57:31.610 --> 00:57:32.860
is the one that matters.

00:57:32.860 --> 00:57:34.840
But you have to decide
what your intention is

00:57:34.840 --> 00:57:37.540
for each of these things.

00:57:37.540 --> 00:57:39.055
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:57:39.055 --> 00:57:40.930
SHERRY TURKLE: And this
is the last question.

00:57:40.930 --> 00:57:40.956
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:57:40.956 --> 00:57:43.100
I was wondering if you've
looked at the difference

00:57:43.100 --> 00:57:46.670
between talking on the phone
with people and texting.

00:57:46.670 --> 00:57:49.732
I notice that if my wife had
a conversation on the phone,

00:57:49.732 --> 00:57:51.690
I'd overhear part of what
she was talking about

00:57:51.690 --> 00:57:53.660
and you can ask
questions about it later.

00:57:53.660 --> 00:57:56.436
But if someone picks up a phone,
looks at it, it's all private.

00:57:56.436 --> 00:57:57.810
Have you looked
at the difference

00:57:57.810 --> 00:57:59.697
between texting and talking?

00:57:59.697 --> 00:58:02.030
SHERRY TURKLE: You know, there
was a wonderful-- we talk

00:58:02.030 --> 00:58:04.380
about privacy and there's
so much to discuss here.

00:58:04.380 --> 00:58:07.380
Let me just refer you
to one wonderful piece

00:58:07.380 --> 00:58:11.170
of writing on the issue
of privacy and texting

00:58:11.170 --> 00:58:12.130
and what you lose.

00:58:12.130 --> 00:58:15.340
A woman recently wrote an op
ed in the "New York Times"

00:58:15.340 --> 00:58:20.910
about being a mother, and
the difference between being

00:58:20.910 --> 00:58:24.980
a mother and doing all of
her work for her children

00:58:24.980 --> 00:58:26.980
like this on the
phone, and the way

00:58:26.980 --> 00:58:29.590
her mother did work
for her by getting

00:58:29.590 --> 00:58:32.800
on the phone-- organizing
a birthday party,

00:58:32.800 --> 00:58:36.600
getting stuff, calling
up A&amp;S and asking

00:58:36.600 --> 00:58:39.750
do they have any
children's toys.

00:58:39.750 --> 00:58:42.550
She says, my children
complain that I'm on the phone

00:58:42.550 --> 00:58:44.710
all the time, texting,
but really, I'm

00:58:44.710 --> 00:58:46.910
organizing their
birthday parties.

00:58:46.910 --> 00:58:51.120
When my mother was on the
phone, I could hear her life.

00:58:51.120 --> 00:58:54.160
I could hear that she
was doing things for me

00:58:54.160 --> 00:58:57.340
and our family and
food and friendships.

00:58:57.340 --> 00:59:00.710
And that part of the problem
with the privacy of what

00:59:00.710 --> 00:59:04.810
we do on our phones is that we
don't see that we're actually

00:59:04.810 --> 00:59:07.070
doing things for each other.

00:59:07.070 --> 00:59:09.120
So I'm just so moved
by your saying,

00:59:09.120 --> 00:59:12.150
I could hear what
my wife was doing.

00:59:12.150 --> 00:59:13.850
So it's very complicated.

00:59:13.850 --> 00:59:18.420
This whole part of how
texting takes us away

00:59:18.420 --> 00:59:19.970
from each other
in this other way

00:59:19.970 --> 00:59:22.375
is just something that people
are starting to study now.

00:59:22.375 --> 00:59:23.750
Well listen, thank
you very much.

00:59:23.750 --> 00:59:24.958
You've been a great audience.

00:59:24.958 --> 00:59:27.560
Sorry about my phone etiquette.

00:59:27.560 --> 00:59:28.640
Thank you very much.

00:59:28.640 --> 00:59:32.590
