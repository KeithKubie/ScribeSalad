00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.560
We know that our brain is what makes us “us”.

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:05.120
It's what does all of our thinking.

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:08.480
It's what processes all the sensory input from the outside world

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:13.320
and creates this reality in our brain that we experience.

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.160
It is “us”.

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:16.000
So the question is

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.520
What is the brain actually made up of?

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:22.960
And it's primarily made up of neurons.

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:26.680
And these are depictions of neurons right over here.

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:31.720
And the current view
on how the brain processes information,

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:33.920
it’s by these different neurons

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:37.840
triggering, by getting excited
and stimulating other neurons

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:42.800
and as the signals go through this huge neural network

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:49.280
that has 80 to 100 billion neurons.

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.480
That electrochemical signal
going through this neural network

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:54.960
is essentially our thought.

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.600
It's essentially our intelligence.

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.840
It's arguably essentially “us”.

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:03.000
So given that, a question arises.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.360
What determines our ability to do things?

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.360
What determines our intelligence?

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:10.760
and one school of thought is that

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:14.880
“okay maybe you’re either just born with it
or either have it or you don't

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.720
some people are smart
some people are less smart

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:19.480
or maybe you can change it"

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:22.160
And it turns out there's actually been
a lot of research on this

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:23.800
in the last few decades.

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:26.920
And the answer is pretty clear

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.400
that your intelligence can actually be changed.

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:33.000
What we've learned
what researchers have taught us

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.400
is that our brains are actually a lot like a muscle.

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.720
We know that you can grow your muscles

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:40.680
by going into the gym and doing exercise

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:41.800
and straining your muscles.

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.600
You don't just work on things
that are easy for your muscles to do.

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.880
You do things that your muscles
have to struggle with

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:48.640
that your muscles have to strain with.

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.200
And then they rebuild themselves
and they come back stronger.

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.840
By struggling it's a signal to your body

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.840
to devote more resources to that part of the body.

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.520
And we see that exact same thing with the brain.

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.000
And here just a couple of examples of it.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.600
This first one,

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:11.360
this shows how the human brain develops in early childhood.

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:17.720
This is a depiction of the neurons
in the brain at birth.

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.320
And then over as a child develops

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:23.120
it interacts with its environment

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.200
It tries things out

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.760
it struggles to talk to converse

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.400
to interact with folks
to understand the world around it.

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.800
and as it struggles, you see that by age 6

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:37.280
you have a much deeper and much stronger connectedness

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.080
between the different neurons

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.400
Similarly...similarly, I can never say that word,

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:48.880
these are depictions of the neurons
of two different scenarios.

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:53.120
This is the the nerves of animals

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.120
that were in unstimulating environments

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.760
where they're not around other other animals

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.120
They’re in a bare cage.

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.640
and then this is the brain of an animal

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.640
that is in a stimulating environment

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.440
that is constantly being challenged

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:08.960
that is constantly looking at stimulating new things

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:12.480
and so the big takeaway
from this whole area of research is

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.320
you absolutely can change your intelligence

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:16.880
that your brain is like a muscle

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:19.440
The more you use it, the stronger gets

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.440
and that the best way to grow it

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:23.880
isn't to do things that are easy for you

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:25.320
that might help a little bit

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:27.240
But what really helps your brain

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:28.800
is when you struggle with things

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:30.120
and actually research shows that

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.840
your brain grows the most
not when you get a question “right”

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:35.520
but when you get a question “wrong”

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:37.840
So at least for me this is incredibly exciting

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:39.280
because it lets me know that

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:40.880
when I'm going through something

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:42.480
and I'm facing those times of

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.560
maybe a little bit of adversity or a little bit of frustration

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:48.360
I can feel good about the fact

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:49.480
that those are actually the times

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:50.840
that I am growing the most.

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.120
And this isn’t just something that I'm saying nice words

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:54.320
research tells us

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:55.600
when you get something wrong

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:56.600
when you challenge your brain

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:58.240
when you review why you got it wrong

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:00.120
when you really process that feedback

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.200
that's when your brain grows the most

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:04.200
and that if you keep doing that

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:07.420
you're well on your way to having a stronger more able

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:08.480
and I guess you could say

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:10.020
smarter brain.
