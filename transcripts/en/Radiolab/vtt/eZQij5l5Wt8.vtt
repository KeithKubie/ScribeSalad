You're listening to radio on New York public radio, public radio,

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:09.503

<v 0>[inaudible] [inaudible]</v>

5
00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:27.740
<v 2>do you know this music? Trust me.</v>

6
00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:29.720
You've heard it your entire life.

7
00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:34.910
<v 0>[inaudible]</v>

8
00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:39.590
<v 2>the reason you can't recognize it now is because the composer born in 1770</v>

9
00:00:39.591 --> 00:00:43.490
intended for this moment. The one you're hearing to last two seconds.

10
00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.043
<v 0>[inaudible]</v>

11
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:51.780
<v 1>however, had he been a whale,</v>

12
00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.600
Beethoven might've written his ninth symphony this way.

13
00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:01.830
<v 0>[inaudible]</v>

14
00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:04.200
<v 3>changes that for us. We're taking an instant,</v>

15
00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.870
we transpire over minutes and a movement might last six hours.

16
00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.480
That's in fact what this is.

17
00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.800
Beethoven's Ninth Symphony digitally stretched from its normal 60 some odd

18
00:01:16.801 --> 00:01:20.730
minutes to last an entire day, 24 hours

19
00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:27.490
and if you sit for the entire 24 hour duration of the piece as people do from

20
00:01:27.491 --> 00:01:32.170
time to time, you realize that this music is not simply slower.

21
00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.630
The Sloane is unlocked something in the original,

22
00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:41.000
maybe it was there all long and we couldn't hear it.

23
00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.400
<v 2>Play with the meter. Music is mostly about me and after all,</v>

24
00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.780
music has a different story to tell. A secret,

25
00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.860
perhaps locked up and signed the routine, changed the routine.

26
00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:54.660
You make new discoveries.

27
00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:00.810
That's what we'll do this hour. We'll look at time so closely.

28
00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.280
We'll discover new things about it.

29
00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:05.880
<v 0>[inaudible]</v>

30
00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:06.780
<v 3>this is Radiolab.</v>

31
00:02:06.781 --> 00:02:10.830
I'm Jad Abumrad my guest tonight for the next hour to help me wrestle with time

32
00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.210
is the science correspondent,

33
00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:16.150
<v 1>Robert Krulwich of ABC News and Nova and Nightline. How are you sir?</v>

34
00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:19.090
I'm very well. I like this bathing and Beethoven thing.

35
00:02:19.091 --> 00:02:22.300
You've got gone to school, right? Yeah. Actually at the end of the program,

36
00:02:22.301 --> 00:02:25.480
we will be dropping in on a performance that happened recently in San Francisco

37
00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:30.310
where people listen to it over the course of an entire day, like day a day.

38
00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:35.350
So we're first, let's begin with a guy who I think you'll find, well,

39
00:02:35.351 --> 00:02:39.790
he thinks very deeply about time. In fact, in a very general kind of way,

40
00:02:39.791 --> 00:02:42.880
you could say he's time obsessed. You've heard of the neurologist,

41
00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:46.660
Oliver's hacks. Sure. The man who mistook his wife for a hat. Yeah. Right.

42
00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.810
And a weakness. So I was over at his house.

43
00:02:49.811 --> 00:02:53.540
This is me actually over at his house right now. Cherokee attorney. Um,

44
00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.740
and he told me this story. I don't know whether this is relevant.

45
00:02:56.741 --> 00:03:00.910
I had an odd experience some years, in fact, in 1993

46
00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:05.260
<v 4>when I got a, um, a message from my publisher,</v>

47
00:03:05.261 --> 00:03:10.150
which they had sent out to various of their authors for their 21st birthday,

48
00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:15.360
they're jubilee asking if we would like to select a year from the previous 21

49
00:03:15.881 --> 00:03:20.320
years and write about it. Um, when I got this message, I thought, well,

50
00:03:20.321 --> 00:03:24.970
why don't I choose 1972, which was the first of the year as an as a year,

51
00:03:24.971 --> 00:03:27.260
which is, uh, um,

52
00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:30.280
very vivid and important for me,

53
00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:33.580
partly because it was the year in which my mother died.

54
00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:38.440
Partly it was the year in which I complete it awakenings. And these two events,

55
00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:41.620
uh, were coupled in some ways.

56
00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:46.180
I was actually in the car when I got this message.

57
00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:50.830
I picked it up on a car phone and I was driving up to Canada and I had a tape

58
00:03:50.831 --> 00:03:52.870
recorder with me. So I, um,

59
00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:57.460
I spoke 1972 aloud and by that time,

60
00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:02.490
uh, I thought, well, why stop? Why don't I do in 1973 as well? Um,

61
00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:07.050
by the time long 72 take, did you get to Montreal or we you just, no, no, I'm,

62
00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:12.040
I'm, I'm a 72 probably took about about, um, half an hour. Well,

63
00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:16.690
by the time I got to the Canadian border, um, I was up to 1987.

64
00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:18.740
Um, and, um,

65
00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:23.330
I didn't fact make an extra loop so that I could compute things. Um,

66
00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:26.470
however it turned out that the,

67
00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:30.610
the most recent years in the late eighties and the nineties,

68
00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:34.600
I did not apparently have such detailed memories of,

69
00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:38.320
and they seem subjectively shorter. So time,

70
00:04:38.321 --> 00:04:41.140
I guess we all know this is a very plastic thing.

71
00:04:41.141 --> 00:04:45.760
It's small and enriched some of the time and it's like flacid and other times.

72
00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:49.120
But because Oliver is so inquisitive, such an investigator at heart,

73
00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:50.560
all his life,

74
00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:54.970
he's looked inside things and beginning when he was 10,

75
00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:59.780
live in 12, he wanted to get inside time. I had, I had, um,

76
00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:04.210
lots of boyish interests. Uh, and um, you know,

77
00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:06.040
there's pre-adolescent interests.

78
00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:09.250
They all took a beating when I became an adolescent. But, uh,

79
00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:12.580
but one of them was chemicals and I had a chemistry laboratory.

80
00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:17.530
One of them was photography and I had dark woman cameras and one of them was

81
00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:18.633
plants.

82
00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:22.840
And in particular my mother was very fond of firms and the garden was full of

83
00:05:22.841 --> 00:05:26.080
firms. I love the way in which the, um,

84
00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:31.870
the curled up fiddleheads or cruises or firms would unfurl.

85
00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:36.490
And it was almost as if time was sort of rolled up inside of them as if time

86
00:05:36.491 --> 00:05:40.360
itself unfilled. But when couldn't actually see this,

87
00:05:40.361 --> 00:05:45.190
they would peps take a a day or two to do this. And I wanted to see it.

88
00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:47.290
It made me think of these Christmas things.

89
00:05:47.291 --> 00:05:52.000
One would blow and these are paper trumpets, which would protrude unfold.

90
00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:53.730
And so I, uh,

91
00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:58.950
set up my camera on a tripod and at least in the daytime I couldn't take

92
00:05:59.061 --> 00:06:00.680
pictures at night. I didn't have a flash.

93
00:06:00.681 --> 00:06:05.480
Then I took a series of pictures every hour or so of the fun.

94
00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:10.700
And that showed these rapidly by putting them together in the flipbook and this

95
00:06:10.701 --> 00:06:10.911
way.

96
00:06:10.911 --> 00:06:15.911
Then what took a day or two or several hours to happen was compressed into

97
00:06:16.821 --> 00:06:17.780
several seconds.

98
00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:22.490
So the compression of time photographically fascinated me

99
00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:27.040
<v 3>as to if Oliver sacks can make a baby. Fern unfurl. Robert,</v>

100
00:06:27.041 --> 00:06:28.510
how about this radio producer?

101
00:06:28.511 --> 00:06:32.950
Tony Schwartz can do the same thing with his baby niece. What?

102
00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:36.010
Except in sound. Oh, here's sped up for your appreciation.

103
00:06:36.011 --> 00:06:40.270
Is Nancy Schwartz from birth to age 12 in two minutes. 12 seconds.

104
00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:41.223
Exactly.

105
00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:43.733
<v 0>Yep.</v>

106
00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:49.933
Okay.

107
00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:03.933
Okay.

108
00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:13.333
Hong Kong.

109
00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:27.663
Hello.

110
00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:40.230
Okay. Huh.

111
00:07:55.140 --> 00:07:55.973
Okay.

112
00:08:12.420 --> 00:08:13.253
Huh?

113
00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:46.590
[inaudible] text next year.

114
00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:52.260
I've been discovering boys

115
00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:56.733
[inaudible]

116
00:09:01.780 --> 00:09:05.350
<v 3>you know what that is? Was that, that is, if you repair it,</v>

117
00:09:05.450 --> 00:09:10.170
what you've just heard is a parent clock, a parent clock.

118
00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:12.900
That's Kinda cool cause the kid gets older.

119
00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:18.500
You can't deny the fact that you must be getting older too when your son has

120
00:09:18.931 --> 00:09:23.160
hair on his legs. I though, Oh man,

121
00:09:23.190 --> 00:09:28.080
I'm getting old. But this is true. This is how the whole world works.

122
00:09:28.081 --> 00:09:31.830
I think it's a, it's a, everything is a clock, I guess. Yeah. By the way,

123
00:09:31.831 --> 00:09:35.820
that was Nancy grows up in the audio flip book recorded and arranged by the

124
00:09:35.821 --> 00:09:37.620
great radio producer, Tony Schwartz,

125
00:09:37.621 --> 00:09:42.420
thanks to him and to Smithsonian folkways recordings and also to you Mr Ronald

126
00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:45.780
Crow, which for joining me today on our program to talk about time.

127
00:09:46.050 --> 00:09:46.883
So here's my question.

128
00:09:47.130 --> 00:09:50.550
If we've got an example of what you just called a parent clock,

129
00:09:51.170 --> 00:09:53.340
you've got other kinds of time, you know like PR,

130
00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:58.110
like personal time getting out of bed time. Yeah. Most of the existence really

131
00:09:58.110 --> 00:10:02.000
<v 5>time was measured by, oh it's lunchtime. It's wake up time, right?</v>

132
00:10:02.070 --> 00:10:06.570
It's time to milk the cow time events are task time, tasks, times.

133
00:10:06.571 --> 00:10:10.530
How do we get from task and personal time to clock time.

134
00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:12.233
Oh that's interesting.

135
00:10:13.110 --> 00:10:16.530
Let's go back to the 18 hundreds and imagine a guy,

136
00:10:16.710 --> 00:10:21.050
we'll call him all Zoltan. Trib wagon. Zero to a hundred yes.

137
00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:23.820
Living in Sandusky, Ohio. And suppose old time wants to know.

138
00:10:23.821 --> 00:10:28.170
You know what time it is. Okay. So if Zoltan walked into

139
00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:32.150
<v 6>to say bigsbys tavern and asked, I missed the big city, can I trouble you?</v>

140
00:10:32.151 --> 00:10:34.730
Put the time. It's right in front of you. You've seen his pocket.

141
00:10:34.910 --> 00:10:36.910
It's built by my nephew, not this modest boy in.

142
00:10:36.930 --> 00:10:40.280
Well it says 33 minutes past the hour. Is that right?

143
00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:42.110
Of course it's right.

144
00:10:43.570 --> 00:10:47.800
<v 1>However, if Zoltan instead of going into the tavern,</v>

145
00:10:47.801 --> 00:10:52.180
had he gone at the exact same moment into the bank building,

146
00:10:52.450 --> 00:10:53.410
how can I help you sir?

147
00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:57.100
And I wondered if you could show me time to read minutes past the hour.

148
00:10:57.430 --> 00:11:02.140
Is he right though? Easy to write or at that very same moment.

149
00:11:02.141 --> 00:11:05.200
Suppose instead of going to this habit of the bank, he'd gone to the hotel.

150
00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:07.193
<v 6>Can I help you?</v>

151
00:11:07.210 --> 00:11:10.810
<v 1>Can you tell me the time? Yes, of course. My, my time piece has,</v>

152
00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:16.510
is that shit? It's sort of a style. Actually, it's 19 past the hour.

153
00:11:17.890 --> 00:11:21.610
So at the tavern it's 33 past the hour at the hotel. 19 past the bank.

154
00:11:21.611 --> 00:11:25.870
Three past. What time is it really in Santa Husky? That's the question.

155
00:11:25.871 --> 00:11:30.310
The answer is there was no official time in San Dusky. Huh? What do you mean?

156
00:11:30.470 --> 00:11:32.920
There's no official time and center? There wasn't any. Not In 1850

157
00:11:33.330 --> 00:11:36.570
<v 5>the government didn't have a time. Really all there were were clocks.</v>

158
00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:41.040
So in Ohio in the 1850s you'd have as many times as they were clocks in the

159
00:11:41.041 --> 00:11:45.090
town. So there was no reason when you think about it to synchronize, if,

160
00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:48.000
if your clock and my clock were four minutes or 10 minutes different in Sandusky

161
00:11:48.001 --> 00:11:50.370
in 1850s who cares until

162
00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:56.880
<v 1>the railroad change every one once the wheel road clean in.</v>

163
00:11:56.890 --> 00:12:01.330
If Zoltan wanted to take out a, how about the a three or three to Cleveland?

164
00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:03.570
Okay. If you wanted to take the fields we believe in,

165
00:12:03.580 --> 00:12:07.000
how would he know when it was three Oh three Oh I see where you're going with

166
00:12:07.130 --> 00:12:10.780
this. If you went by the bank's clock, he'd arrive a half hour ahead of time.

167
00:12:11.730 --> 00:12:16.450
If you went by the hotel clock heater arrived, the Nicotine, oh wait, wait,

168
00:12:16.630 --> 00:12:18.580
wait. And if you went by the taverns clock.

169
00:12:18.700 --> 00:12:20.890
<v 0>Oh Wow.</v>

170
00:12:22.910 --> 00:12:24.980
<v 1>So for the sake of their business,</v>

171
00:12:25.180 --> 00:12:28.940
meaning the real roads created railroad time and began putting up clocks of

172
00:12:28.941 --> 00:12:33.140
their own. It makes sense. And because the railroads were so important, I mean,

173
00:12:33.170 --> 00:12:35.930
the tavern would, you have to get its beer deliveries from the railroad.

174
00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:38.660
And I guess the banks would have to get their cash from the railroad and the

175
00:12:38.690 --> 00:12:40.340
hotel would have to get their guests when they're at road.

176
00:12:40.460 --> 00:12:44.330
So it gradually reload time becomes everybody's time.

177
00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:51.790
<v 5>So what happened to local time? Will local time disappeared. Really? Yeah.</v>

178
00:12:51.791 --> 00:12:54.640
If local time means that when it's noon in Sandusky,

179
00:12:54.641 --> 00:12:59.230
the sun is directly over your head. By 1880 that wasn't true anymore.

180
00:12:59.720 --> 00:12:59.920
Oh,

181
00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:04.920
the railroad had instructed Sandusky that from now on it's noon would be 20

182
00:13:05.351 --> 00:13:08.140
minutes later. So that could fit into the railroad schedule. Wait,

183
00:13:08.190 --> 00:13:12.760
so they moved noon over 20 minutes. Yeah. And they were protests about this.

184
00:13:13.170 --> 00:13:15.500
<v 0>I put it to do ladies and gentlemen.</v>

185
00:13:25.050 --> 00:13:25.160
[inaudible]

186
00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:27.380
<v 5>so in all seriousness, people fought against this.</v>

187
00:13:27.381 --> 00:13:29.450
They rebelled against the railroads. Oh,

188
00:13:29.451 --> 00:13:33.050
there were time wars in certain towns where part of the town would go to

189
00:13:33.051 --> 00:13:36.570
railroad time. But the other part would determinately stick with the,

190
00:13:36.710 --> 00:13:40.340
what used to be local time and they'd have different times in the town. Wow.

191
00:13:40.370 --> 00:13:42.200
It's almost like as a personal freedom, it's, yeah,

192
00:13:42.460 --> 00:13:46.360
because time in a way represents your own identity and they were,

193
00:13:46.361 --> 00:13:48.740
didn't want to give up their identity to the railroad. Not at first,

194
00:13:49.100 --> 00:13:49.671
but in the end,

195
00:13:49.671 --> 00:13:54.080
Sandusky and then every other town eventually conformed to railroad time and

196
00:13:54.081 --> 00:13:57.800
that is how time became standardized. Time became zoned.

197
00:13:58.040 --> 00:14:01.310
Time became clock reference and you ask somebody, what time is it?

198
00:14:01.311 --> 00:14:03.700
They don't say, you know, oh, it's bedtime or it's lunchtime.

199
00:14:03.820 --> 00:14:04.760
They don't look up at the side.

200
00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:09.570
They look at the standard and the [inaudible].

201
00:14:10.580 --> 00:14:14.920
<v 7>Yeah, brief pick, go. The clock is time. One off every 60 minutes.</v>

202
00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:19.030
Tweet every 12 hour tour of old, relentless hands, turning out car carload.

203
00:14:19.031 --> 00:14:19.990
Lots of time.

204
00:14:26.270 --> 00:14:30.230
<v 1>There's an interesting connection to explore here and it has to do with horses,</v>

205
00:14:30.980 --> 00:14:32.390
horses, horses.

206
00:14:35.900 --> 00:14:37.190
You mentioned railroad companies.

207
00:14:37.191 --> 00:14:39.800
It just so happens that the owner of the biggest ramp of the company,

208
00:14:39.890 --> 00:14:43.480
Leland Stanford, you know I know Stanford University University, right?

209
00:14:43.970 --> 00:14:48.240
He was really into speed and he owned a really fast horse and the horse,

210
00:14:48.241 --> 00:14:52.280
his name is oxidant oxidant. I know, I remember that story goes. This horse

211
00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:55.880
<v 3>was the subject of a gentleman's bet. Well there was no gentleman's bet.</v>

212
00:14:56.570 --> 00:14:59.930
It's a myth. Danford so far as we know was not a betting man.

213
00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:01.850
That's Rebecca Solnit. She would know.

214
00:15:01.851 --> 00:15:04.130
She wrote a book about this called River of shadows.

215
00:15:04.550 --> 00:15:07.930
And the focus of her book is the solver of the bet. Oh, I got hurt.

216
00:15:08.130 --> 00:15:11.960
It was an argument. There's no evidence that there was money on it. In any case,

217
00:15:11.961 --> 00:15:15.050
this argument amongst Stanford and his railroad buddies centered around the

218
00:15:15.051 --> 00:15:16.850
following question. When a horse gallops,

219
00:15:16.851 --> 00:15:19.550
do all four of its feet leave the ground at once? When do you think?

220
00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:22.730
I don't know. I'm just not a question. I would frankly every, I was getting one,

221
00:15:22.731 --> 00:15:23.360
but,

222
00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:25.850
well at the time it was a big question cause they had no way of knowing cause

223
00:15:25.860 --> 00:15:27.800
horses moved faster than eyeballs can see.

224
00:15:27.830 --> 00:15:31.460
So Leland Stanford wanted to prove that a horse had all four feet off the ground

225
00:15:31.461 --> 00:15:36.230
at one time and he was recommended to try my bridge as the photographer to

226
00:15:36.231 --> 00:15:39.320
capture this. Along comes Edward Muybridge, the photographer.

227
00:15:39.580 --> 00:15:42.260
If he could take a picture of the voice, that exactly the right instant,

228
00:15:42.710 --> 00:15:45.530
you could see whether all four feet were off the ground and solve the bed.

229
00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:49.610
Here's the problem. Cameras in those days were very slow.

230
00:15:49.790 --> 00:15:53.720
A fast exposure would be maybe a second or several seconds.

231
00:15:53.990 --> 00:15:58.460
My vision was going to push photography to suddenly be able to capture motion in

232
00:15:58.461 --> 00:16:01.010
a 500th of a second. Otherwise you've just got blur.

233
00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:11.700
<v 8>Imagine that first step out of the world of a blur when bread,</v>

234
00:16:11.820 --> 00:16:15.450
she had stretched a wire across the race track and attached it to the shutter

235
00:16:15.510 --> 00:16:20.250
mechanism on his camera. Oxidant the horse gallops by trips.

236
00:16:20.251 --> 00:16:21.084
The wire

237
00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:24.480
<v 0>[inaudible],</v>

238
00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:27.000
<v 3>which freezes the horse nit gala,</v>

239
00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:29.740
steals him right out of the flow of time.

240
00:16:31.940 --> 00:16:32.230
<v 0>[inaudible]</v>

241
00:16:32.230 --> 00:16:34.000
<v 3>except my bridge doesn't just take one photo.</v>

242
00:16:34.001 --> 00:16:38.260
He takes 24 c it place 24 cameras in a line,

243
00:16:38.261 --> 00:16:43.000
one after the other with 24 trip wires stretching across the racetrack and the

244
00:16:43.001 --> 00:16:43.850
horse trip. Every one.

245
00:16:44.510 --> 00:16:45.343
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

246
00:16:49.740 --> 00:16:54.480
<v 8>24 frozen and blurry mining horses. So what did, what did they see?</v>

247
00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:55.271
<v 3>Well,</v>

248
00:16:55.271 --> 00:16:58.720
the pictures formed a series of a horse running and some of those photos showed

249
00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:00.940
oxidant yes, with all four feet off the ground.

250
00:17:01.060 --> 00:17:04.090
So the camera here unlocks a secret.

251
00:17:04.120 --> 00:17:07.150
It lets us see something you could never see before because this camera

252
00:17:07.390 --> 00:17:10.540
essentially, it stops time. Exactly. Meanwhile, it says,

253
00:17:10.541 --> 00:17:13.840
Rebecca morbridge became fascinated with learning more secrets of time,

254
00:17:15.430 --> 00:17:19.920
<v 9>secrets locked inside the basic human movements. No leap a splash,</v>

255
00:17:19.980 --> 00:17:23.310
a walk of parallel at wow. Mundane.

256
00:17:23.311 --> 00:17:26.550
But they're so enchanted when you really pay attention to them. Yeah. Boy,

257
00:17:26.820 --> 00:17:28.260
preach had photograph rushing water.

258
00:17:28.261 --> 00:17:30.540
He was obsessed with water in his landscape. Pictures.

259
00:17:30.900 --> 00:17:34.110
So you obsessive Lee has people pour water, splash water,

260
00:17:34.170 --> 00:17:39.030
pour water over themselves, poor pictures of water, pour water into glasses,

261
00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:42.300
splash water out of basins, bathe in water.

262
00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:45.150
And you can see all these droplets frozen in [inaudible].

263
00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:50.070
<v 0>There's one</v>

264
00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:51.120
<v 3>particular photo, Robert,</v>

265
00:17:51.121 --> 00:17:55.830
where you see a sheet of water suspended in the air hovering over the splasher.

266
00:17:58.080 --> 00:18:02.040
Kinda like a ghost. Hmm. Oh Wow. Anyhow,

267
00:18:02.430 --> 00:18:05.070
take all those frozen moments and align them one after the other and play them

268
00:18:05.071 --> 00:18:09.840
back and you've got flow again. I'll be at artificial flow,

269
00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:10.920
which we call movies.

270
00:18:13.310 --> 00:18:15.660
<v 10>[inaudible] movies are good. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

271
00:18:16.850 --> 00:18:19.910
<v 1>The next time you're feeling stressed out, you saved yourself. I'm stressed.</v>

272
00:18:19.970 --> 00:18:21.850
I need to go to a movie to relax. Well,

273
00:18:21.860 --> 00:18:25.790
you should know that the technology that made the movies is exactly the thing

274
00:18:25.791 --> 00:18:28.250
which sped up the pace of modern life, which stressed you out,

275
00:18:28.280 --> 00:18:31.040
which led you to go to the movies. Don't, what does that mean? What do you,

276
00:18:31.041 --> 00:18:31.874
what do you mean by that?

277
00:18:31.970 --> 00:18:35.900
Well one of the first ways movies were used was to film factory workers doing

278
00:18:35.901 --> 00:18:40.430
repetitive tasks and then find out how to make those tasks more efficient.

279
00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:44.400
So if I were pushing the lever, maybe too slowly is this right?

280
00:18:44.420 --> 00:18:47.660
They would find the guy who did it the right way, film him,

281
00:18:47.661 --> 00:18:50.630
slow the film down and then use that to teach everyone else.

282
00:18:50.690 --> 00:18:52.280
And then when World War II came,

283
00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:54.770
this was not just now in the cause of efficiency.

284
00:18:54.771 --> 00:18:57.770
This was a life or death matter. Cause this is how you beat Nazis.

285
00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:03.260
<v 7>All the scientific devices. I'm chronology, I'm a senior.</v>

286
00:19:03.320 --> 00:19:08.320
The manufacturing time and towards it in all hands mean victory and all hands

287
00:19:09.060 --> 00:19:11.420
must be as we [inaudible]

288
00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:18.110
<v 5>or there's a whole nother way to think about this.</v>

289
00:19:18.410 --> 00:19:23.410
Time can be a weapon in battle or it can be the most sensuous and subtle and

290
00:19:26.481 --> 00:19:27.800
natural thing in the world.

291
00:19:27.801 --> 00:19:32.030
And I learned about this from a book by Jay Griffiths called a sideways look at

292
00:19:32.031 --> 00:19:35.120
time. Let me just take a stop here at the clocks,

293
00:19:35.150 --> 00:19:37.640
even though you don't like clocks because there's so many cool clocks in your

294
00:19:37.641 --> 00:19:42.110
book. First of all, there's a spice clock.

295
00:19:46.390 --> 00:19:48.030
<v 12>Yes, we're used to clocks,</v>

296
00:19:48.220 --> 00:19:50.920
which you can see when it's really dark and it's seen and you can see that

297
00:19:50.921 --> 00:19:54.820
you've just woken up at two 35 and you really didn't want to wake up at two 35

298
00:19:55.270 --> 00:19:56.680
but of course for a long time, you know,

299
00:19:57.190 --> 00:20:01.390
in the night you don't have a way of seeing, um, what the time is.

300
00:20:01.391 --> 00:20:05.620
And so somebody invented a spice cock so you could taste your way through the

301
00:20:05.621 --> 00:20:08.140
nights. So there would be maybe kind of, you know,

302
00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:11.410
cinnamon for about one o'clock and Turmeric for two o'clock.

303
00:20:11.650 --> 00:20:15.400
You're sitting there in bed and you stiff the time. Oh, you could taste it.

304
00:20:21.770 --> 00:20:24.840
<v 1>Right. How about the clock of birds? This is the [inaudible]</v>

305
00:20:25.570 --> 00:20:27.090
<v 12>actually the Colonia people apart when you're getting,</v>

306
00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:31.380
they have what they call a clock of birds and that certain birds like the um,

307
00:20:31.470 --> 00:20:35.190
New Guinea fryer bird and the hooded butch. But when they sing in the mornings,

308
00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:40.280
the children are taught to understand that that's a signal to get up and leave

309
00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:42.233
the house.

310
00:20:42.610 --> 00:20:43.443
<v 13>Wow.</v>

311
00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:48.010
When those

312
00:20:48.010 --> 00:20:50.620
<v 14>birds sing the late afternoon calls,</v>

313
00:20:50.950 --> 00:20:53.600
that's a signal to the children to go back home.

314
00:20:57.830 --> 00:21:01.390
The forest in the central orange in Papua New Guinea. I've seen that as a very,

315
00:21:01.391 --> 00:21:02.230
very, um,

316
00:21:02.710 --> 00:21:06.550
difficult place to be in once it's dog and that the children would need to know

317
00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:09.100
about what time to start heading for home

318
00:21:15.210 --> 00:21:15.481
<v 1>now.</v>

319
00:21:15.481 --> 00:21:20.481
How about it's 1751 and Carl Linnaeus famous catalog categorize her of

320
00:21:21.631 --> 00:21:22.960
everything. Yes. Sweden

321
00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:26.190
<v 12>clock. What do you make in a flower clock so that you could,</v>

322
00:21:26.220 --> 00:21:30.480
you could see by the blooming of different flowers, um, what time it was.

323
00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:33.840
<v 5>So some kind of something that blooms in the morning and then folds up like a</v>

324
00:21:33.841 --> 00:21:37.680
morning glory would be there in the morning and then in the evening and evening

325
00:21:37.681 --> 00:21:41.250
primrose would come out and these are all plants that open for an hour or two

326
00:21:41.251 --> 00:21:42.084
and then close.

327
00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:47.280
So if you're walking by and you see a blush of let's say pink,

328
00:21:47.310 --> 00:21:48.600
then you know, oh, it must be in the morning.

329
00:21:48.601 --> 00:21:51.330
Or if you see a blush of privilege, oh, it must be lunchtime or whatever it is.

330
00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:53.790
Yes, exactly. Exactly. That's by the way, very,

331
00:21:54.090 --> 00:21:57.770
very good gardening to be able to do that. Yes, isn't it? Isn't it?

332
00:21:57.940 --> 00:22:00.030
<v 12>And connected to that, there's also the, um,</v>

333
00:22:00.280 --> 00:22:03.810
Andaman forest and the Andaman islands in the Indian Ocean. Um,

334
00:22:04.050 --> 00:22:08.050
the people have a scent calendar, which I found the most beautiful idea because,

335
00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:08.680
um,

336
00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:13.680
what it was is a way of kind of describing the months by the sense of certain

337
00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:15.130
fruits and flowers.

338
00:22:19.640 --> 00:22:20.473
<v 14>Hello</v>

339
00:22:21.060 --> 00:22:24.000
<v 12>time at time is everywhere in nature. What I put at,</v>

340
00:22:24.001 --> 00:22:26.640
one of the things I wanted to do with the whole book was to say, you know,

341
00:22:26.670 --> 00:22:29.460
we think of time being to do with clocks. In fact, for most of the world,

342
00:22:29.461 --> 00:22:33.600
for most of history time has been absolutely embedded in nature in some

343
00:22:33.601 --> 00:22:34.560
beautiful ways.

344
00:22:41.410 --> 00:22:41.500
<v 0>[inaudible]</v>

345
00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:44.680
<v 1>we'll hear more from Arthur j Griffiths later in the program. Thanks, Robert.</v>

00:23:22.980 --> 00:23:25.080
<v 3>Hey, this is jad from Radiolab. We're having a, uh,</v>

358
00:23:25.081 --> 00:23:27.360
we're celebrating little milestone over here at radio lab.

359
00:23:27.361 --> 00:23:30.120
We have been doing this when making stories for the podcast,

360
00:23:30.121 --> 00:23:35.121
for the radio for 15 years at is 15 years of stories about like um,

361
00:23:37.590 --> 00:23:40.410
I don't know, the science of morality, the metamorphosis of butterflies,

362
00:23:40.830 --> 00:23:43.830
legal foundation for the war on terror. All these different stories.

363
00:23:44.370 --> 00:23:46.100
I've been doing it for years. So check out

364
00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:50.600
<v 16>our latest episode out of the archives in all of our episodes are available</v>

365
00:23:50.601 --> 00:23:51.980
wherever you get your podcasts

366
00:24:03.260 --> 00:24:07.300
<v 3>on. Chad having Rod. This is radio lab. Our program today is about time.</v>

367
00:24:07.810 --> 00:24:11.530
All the different flavors of time in here with me to,

368
00:24:11.770 --> 00:24:16.770
shall we say taste those flavors is Robert Krulwich correspondent for ABC News

369
00:24:16.930 --> 00:24:18.040
Nightline. Yeah. Hi Robert.

370
00:24:18.041 --> 00:24:20.920
We've been talking about clocks for the last 20 minutes and if you took all the

371
00:24:21.350 --> 00:24:25.990
clock counting 20 minutes exactly. If he took away all the clocks.

372
00:24:25.991 --> 00:24:28.780
We've been talking about the bird clock and the spice clock and the clock on the

373
00:24:28.781 --> 00:24:33.040
wall and then you had to talk about time without mentioning a clock.

374
00:24:33.100 --> 00:24:37.150
What are we left with? How would you, ah, that's actually pretty tough question.

375
00:24:37.151 --> 00:24:40.550
What is climb essentially or the peak? I have a neighbor. Uh,

376
00:24:41.230 --> 00:24:44.170
Brian Green is a best selling author, the elegant universe fabric of the cosmos.

377
00:24:44.171 --> 00:24:46.000
Most recently investor of math at Columbia,

378
00:24:46.001 --> 00:24:48.850
professor of Physics at Columbia pretty much does Columbia.

379
00:24:49.330 --> 00:24:52.360
I asked him your question. I asked him what his time,

380
00:24:52.900 --> 00:24:55.840
<v 16>if you, if you really pushed me and said, what is time?</v>

381
00:24:55.841 --> 00:24:58.960
I'd say time is that which allows us to see that something has changed.

382
00:24:59.290 --> 00:25:01.660
When you see the second hand in your clock going around,

383
00:25:01.810 --> 00:25:05.830
it's changing position and that's the simplest version of a change corresponding

384
00:25:05.831 --> 00:25:07.480
to time. Elapsing

385
00:25:09.340 --> 00:25:09.881
<v 3>okay, Robert,</v>

386
00:25:09.881 --> 00:25:14.320
I'm looking at the clock here on the wall and watching second hand and write

387
00:25:14.360 --> 00:25:17.140
these changing positions just as he says now,

388
00:25:17.141 --> 00:25:19.870
I imagine all the clocks in the world agree on what a second is,

389
00:25:19.871 --> 00:25:24.550
but what if we were to take the clocks away? Is there, I mean I would still,

390
00:25:24.610 --> 00:25:28.840
I still in my bones believe that that somewhere there's a clock ticking that

391
00:25:28.841 --> 00:25:30.210
says what a second is.

392
00:25:31.220 --> 00:25:33.110
<v 16>Same in Mars and yeah, right.</v>

393
00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:38.200
Everybody thinks that cause it's so sensible that time is universally the same

394
00:25:38.721 --> 00:25:42.650
for everyone. Now here's the big secret. Apparently that's not true.

395
00:25:42.830 --> 00:25:44.630
Time is not universal and this is,

396
00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:49.340
Brian is part of Einstein's theory of relativity when we move relative to each

397
00:25:49.341 --> 00:25:50.060
other.

398
00:25:50.060 --> 00:25:55.060
A very basic lesson of relativity is that our watches will tick off time at

399
00:25:56.151 --> 00:25:58.190
different rates. If you have a good watch,

400
00:25:58.191 --> 00:25:59.930
I don't know what a good watch day is, a donut on one,

401
00:25:59.931 --> 00:26:03.730
but if you had a a Rolex watch, I never have owned a watch but right.

402
00:26:03.780 --> 00:26:07.250
You've never owned a wiper on to watch and never liked the idea of a timepiece

403
00:26:07.310 --> 00:26:11.390
sort of taking away on my arm. It really always bothered me, but anyway,

404
00:26:11.900 --> 00:26:15.890
if you had it Rolex and I had a Rolex say and we synchronize them perfectly,

405
00:26:16.370 --> 00:26:21.370
then we move relative to one another and then we rejoin and compare our watches.

406
00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:23.510
They will not agree.

407
00:26:25.960 --> 00:26:27.850
<v 1>Well to demonstrate what Brian was talking about,</v>

408
00:26:27.851 --> 00:26:29.650
we are now in the central park.

409
00:26:29.651 --> 00:26:32.950
We've got the area entirely roped off because we are going to demonstrate one of

410
00:26:32.951 --> 00:26:37.870
Einstein's famous thought experiments which suggests that the subject and if you

411
00:26:37.871 --> 00:26:39.910
will, I would be the subject, Chad, by all means, et cetera.

412
00:26:39.911 --> 00:26:44.911
You must take a trip at an extraordinarily high speed that's required here.

413
00:26:44.941 --> 00:26:48.330
So if you can help me by giving me whatever you got over there. Uh sure. Uh,

414
00:26:48.331 --> 00:26:52.590
here is a jetpack turbocharged chef fan. Put It on back. Yeah.

415
00:26:53.310 --> 00:26:57.300
Okay. Now take these rollerblades. Oh, okay. Yeah. I'll put one right.

416
00:26:57.301 --> 00:27:00.870
One around left foot, right foot and on your left arm.

417
00:27:00.900 --> 00:27:05.900
The left Jake set the target speed dial and your jet pack to 669 million miles

418
00:27:06.541 --> 00:27:07.980
an hour. It's a little fast.

419
00:27:08.040 --> 00:27:12.030
669 million miles an hour.

420
00:27:12.570 --> 00:27:16.620
What time does your watch say? Five 24 yeah, so it is mine. We are synchronized,

421
00:27:16.970 --> 00:27:20.940
not exactly synchronized when it gets a five 25 in three, two,

422
00:27:21.660 --> 00:27:25.130
one, push the red button, hitting the red button and

423
00:27:31.300 --> 00:27:33.410
I skipped actually going by on this side. I see.

424
00:27:33.590 --> 00:27:34.820
I love the one coming up over there.

425
00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:37.870
<v 0>You're going by there now by the way,</v>

426
00:27:38.020 --> 00:27:41.710
my watch is absolutely perfectly. I'm having

427
00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:47.740
[inaudible] now

428
00:27:50.650 --> 00:27:55.380
<v 1>coming closer, coming closer and landed. That was very racing.</v>

429
00:27:55.630 --> 00:27:58.620
Now Robert. Yes. Look at your watch. All right.

430
00:27:58.890 --> 00:28:02.790
What time does it say it's is uh, five 26, with times on your watch?

431
00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:07.710
Five 33. That's a seven minute difference. Is your watch broken? Cause my,

432
00:28:07.720 --> 00:28:12.090
no, no, no, no, no, no. Well, time for you is different than time for me.

433
00:28:12.540 --> 00:28:13.373
You mean the literal,

434
00:28:14.230 --> 00:28:19.230
<v 16>literally it's not that my watch somehow was shucking up and wasn't functioning</v>

435
00:28:19.451 --> 00:28:19.991
properly.

436
00:28:19.991 --> 00:28:24.550
No time itself is not some universal concept.

437
00:28:24.640 --> 00:28:28.720
Time is held by the individual, by the Observer.

438
00:28:28.900 --> 00:28:32.770
So that if I am moving relative to you, time for me,

439
00:28:32.771 --> 00:28:35.650
a lapse is at a different rate than it does for you.

440
00:28:35.740 --> 00:28:40.740
So relativity says that time and speed are mysteriously coupled.

441
00:28:40.960 --> 00:28:43.750
So the, when I go fast, my time goes slow,

442
00:28:43.870 --> 00:28:46.600
which explains why are watches don't agree exactly.

443
00:28:46.660 --> 00:28:51.130
So this whole notion that we all have the time kind of applies the same to

444
00:28:51.131 --> 00:28:53.230
everybody on earth and Mars, Jupiter,

445
00:28:53.231 --> 00:28:56.710
the entire cosmos that we can see is totally wrong.

446
00:28:58.420 --> 00:29:00.880
But let me ask you this. When you were rushing through space before,

447
00:29:01.330 --> 00:29:04.510
your time is apparently going slower, but did you feel slower?

448
00:29:04.690 --> 00:29:07.870
If I looked at my watch, everything was perfectly normal to me.

449
00:29:08.200 --> 00:29:12.070
My clock was ticking perfectly normal for me. So it was mine in central park.

450
00:29:12.071 --> 00:29:12.970
So what is [inaudible]

451
00:29:13.750 --> 00:29:17.380
<v 1>if somehow you could appeared in on me up there in outer space,</v>

452
00:29:17.500 --> 00:29:21.710
go in real real fast. I would have seen slower too.

453
00:29:22.600 --> 00:29:25.300
Not only would my watch be ticking slower for you

454
00:29:27.850 --> 00:29:29.620
if we think about,

455
00:29:29.670 --> 00:29:32.020
<v 17>I mean be be,</v>

456
00:29:34.430 --> 00:29:38.990
<v 6>oh [inaudible]</v>

457
00:29:46.840 --> 00:29:49.810
<v 16>so what do you do with this information? What do you mean? Well,</v>

458
00:29:49.811 --> 00:29:54.220
physics teaches us that if I'm say running down the street and my time is

459
00:29:54.610 --> 00:29:58.780
ticking infinitesimally slower than that guy's time over there. Why?

460
00:29:59.950 --> 00:30:02.350
Because he's standing still here and you're running right?

461
00:30:02.380 --> 00:30:05.440
But you're in different time capsules kind of. Yeah. Apparently so.

462
00:30:05.860 --> 00:30:08.650
And I know this is what science tells me, right?

463
00:30:08.710 --> 00:30:11.770
But my common sense tells me that that is completely wrong.

464
00:30:12.180 --> 00:30:14.050
Nothing in my experience tells me this is the case.

465
00:30:14.110 --> 00:30:15.910
This is like one of the great conundrums.

466
00:30:15.911 --> 00:30:20.710
It seems to me that what you learn in science is so different what you feel in

467
00:30:20.711 --> 00:30:21.550
your regular life.

468
00:30:22.150 --> 00:30:25.750
How do you live between those two worlds or what you know and what you feel are

469
00:30:25.751 --> 00:30:30.370
so different? Brian, do you learn to trust your mind over your senses?

470
00:30:30.371 --> 00:30:31.960
Is that what you do? Well,

471
00:30:32.170 --> 00:30:35.470
I learned to trust my senses,

472
00:30:35.770 --> 00:30:39.580
but see them within a much larger framework.

473
00:30:40.060 --> 00:30:44.050
I love to walk down the street and imagine that because I'm walking,

474
00:30:44.051 --> 00:30:47.110
I'm kind of shattering the, the time around me.

475
00:30:47.350 --> 00:30:51.820
I'm causing time to elapse at a different rate than it would if I were standing

476
00:30:51.821 --> 00:30:56.260
still. I love that idea. It's not that I don't trust experience.

477
00:30:56.261 --> 00:30:58.780
You're hitting time square and you're wandering through. You Think, oh boy,

478
00:30:58.810 --> 00:31:02.440
I ain't really changing the universe of all these other people. Well,

479
00:31:02.441 --> 00:31:05.240
I really considered it totally personal, so I'm not changing their tone.

480
00:31:05.570 --> 00:31:08.710
I'm changing. I'm changing the, the rate at which time elapses for me.

481
00:31:09.040 --> 00:31:13.330
So I have power. So when you run to catch a bus, you think, hey,

482
00:31:13.410 --> 00:31:15.890
I've got to get on this bus. Also, I'm slowing down time for my center.

483
00:31:16.060 --> 00:31:20.440
I do sometimes, not always, but it's there. And you know,

484
00:31:20.441 --> 00:31:22.900
when I look at the tabletop, I,

485
00:31:23.110 --> 00:31:28.110
I delight in the fact that I can in my mind picture the atoms and molecules and

486
00:31:28.661 --> 00:31:32.170
the interactions between them in the mostly empty space that's in there and that

487
00:31:32.171 --> 00:31:34.210
when my hand touches the table Top,

488
00:31:34.360 --> 00:31:38.410
I see the electrons in the outer surface of my hand pushing against the

489
00:31:38.411 --> 00:31:42.010
electrons in the outer surface of the table. I'm not really touching the table.

490
00:31:42.100 --> 00:31:44.410
My hand never comes into contact with the table.

491
00:31:44.470 --> 00:31:47.020
What's happening as the electrons are getting really close together and they're

492
00:31:47.021 --> 00:31:48.010
repelling each other,

493
00:31:48.220 --> 00:31:51.760
and I love the fact that I'm in essence deforming the surface of the table by

494
00:31:51.761 --> 00:31:56.380
making my electrons come really close to it. That enriches my experience.

495
00:31:56.381 --> 00:31:59.290
It doesn't, do you hear this with others? Rarely.

496
00:32:02.760 --> 00:32:03.593
<v 18>Okay.</v>

501
00:32:30.300 --> 00:32:32.540
We're talking about time today in here with me to help you do that.

502
00:32:32.541 --> 00:32:37.170
Is Robert Krulwich, ABC News and Blah, blah, blah, blah,

503
00:32:37.450 --> 00:32:40.370
blah, blah, blah. Is My specialty, which is are from Brian Green

504
00:32:40.900 --> 00:32:40.901
<v 3>physicist.</v>

505
00:32:40.901 --> 00:32:45.230
Tell us about a frankly troubling idea that there is no such thing as a standard

506
00:32:45.650 --> 00:32:50.600
time, which I'm still having trouble believing frankly. In any case,

507
00:32:50.601 --> 00:32:51.650
it makes me think of this.

508
00:32:51.920 --> 00:32:55.160
Do you know when you see a tortoise wandering through the garden door and he's

509
00:32:55.161 --> 00:33:00.060
going so slow [inaudible] and then you see a hummingbird with by film?

510
00:33:01.040 --> 00:33:02.420
Clearly they're moving in different tempos,

511
00:33:02.421 --> 00:33:06.350
but perhaps they're also experiencing entirely different universes of time.

512
00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:08.950
Do you ever wonder about that? Right.

513
00:33:09.150 --> 00:33:11.340
<v 5>I think everybody wonders that, but of course,</v>

514
00:33:11.341 --> 00:33:13.440
unless you are a hummingbird or a tortoise,

515
00:33:13.740 --> 00:33:16.830
you can never really know whether what's going on in your head is different.

516
00:33:17.070 --> 00:33:19.230
True. But Oliver Sacks, the neurologist we met before,

517
00:33:19.620 --> 00:33:22.350
he found a different tempo,

518
00:33:22.351 --> 00:33:25.830
radically different tempos in human beings. Really a,

519
00:33:25.831 --> 00:33:27.930
he's a neurologist and you worked at a hospital in the Bronx.

520
00:33:27.931 --> 00:33:32.760
Still does at Beth Abraham where he once had patients who seemed so slow.

521
00:33:33.090 --> 00:33:37.770
They were almost frozen. He told me about one of those patients named Myron v

522
00:33:38.420 --> 00:33:43.220
<v 4>for long periods of the day. Mylan would be apparently emotionless.</v>

523
00:33:43.670 --> 00:33:46.070
Although when I looked at him,

524
00:33:46.100 --> 00:33:51.100
I would see his frozen finger in different positions in which his right hand

525
00:33:53.720 --> 00:33:55.130
would be raised.

526
00:33:55.850 --> 00:34:00.140
A lot of these patients would be frozen and all the positions,

527
00:34:00.350 --> 00:34:01.760
which I'm illustrating now,

528
00:34:01.761 --> 00:34:06.260
but don't let it poses hand in the air, but just stuck,

529
00:34:06.290 --> 00:34:09.780
stuck in stuff. People would be stuck in all the poses.

530
00:34:10.220 --> 00:34:14.240
I thought mountain was one of those and I, and I commented on this,

531
00:34:14.241 --> 00:34:17.100
that I had often seen him stuck in these, uh,

532
00:34:17.330 --> 00:34:20.570
photos and posters and he got indignant and said,

533
00:34:20.571 --> 00:34:24.500
what do you mean photos and posers? He said, I wish I was wiping my nose.

534
00:34:24.670 --> 00:34:28.790
And I said, I said, you're joking, putting me on.

535
00:34:29.510 --> 00:34:32.750
And he said, I'm not. And I, and he was,

536
00:34:33.110 --> 00:34:37.130
he was as possible by what I said as I was by what he had said.

537
00:34:37.340 --> 00:34:42.200
But then after he had told me this, I thought, well, hell, you know, I'm,

538
00:34:42.201 --> 00:34:46.430
I must watch this and I must record it. And he said he was just working.

539
00:34:46.480 --> 00:34:49.010
It was just wiping his nose and I was just walking my nose.

540
00:34:51.500 --> 00:34:55.070
Okay. Now that's something that takes me about two seconds. Exactly. Yeah.

541
00:34:55.460 --> 00:34:58.730
Whereas apparently this movement of the arm, if this is what he was doing,

542
00:34:58.731 --> 00:35:00.110
was taking about two hours.

543
00:35:00.740 --> 00:35:05.510
So I took a series of photographs at intervals of a few minutes.

544
00:35:05.511 --> 00:35:10.511
Each of still Myron has his arms gently going up ev apparently still mountain.

545
00:35:11.900 --> 00:35:15.560
How many photographs? I have about 20 photographs or so in two hours.

546
00:35:16.190 --> 00:35:18.590
And then I put them together in a,

547
00:35:18.890 --> 00:35:22.020
it had to fall and then the whole flick pack, you know the,

548
00:35:22.090 --> 00:35:26.450
the way we used to do as a kid, right. And then one couldn't fact see with this,

549
00:35:26.630 --> 00:35:31.630
that fee 20 also photos covering two hours in fact showed a smooth movement to

550
00:35:34.521 --> 00:35:37.740
wipe his nose or movement, which normally it takes two seconds,

551
00:35:37.830 --> 00:35:39.810
but which in him was taking two hours,

552
00:35:40.470 --> 00:35:45.470
although this left open the profound parcel of how come he was not only taking

553
00:35:45.751 --> 00:35:47.040
two hours to do so,

554
00:35:47.160 --> 00:35:50.760
but didn't realize he was taking two hours to do so that the movement,

555
00:35:50.761 --> 00:35:55.500
which to us was glacially slow, was not slow to him, was normal.

556
00:35:56.160 --> 00:35:57.210
Did you ever show

557
00:35:57.440 --> 00:36:02.210
<v 5>Myron the pictures that you had made? Yes. And didn't,</v>

558
00:36:02.211 --> 00:36:06.740
did you say, so Myron, look at this, it took you two hours to do this.

559
00:36:07.070 --> 00:36:08.320
I mean, if you did that then

560
00:36:08.420 --> 00:36:13.250
<v 4>what did he say? Um, uh, he was astonished and that's too mild a word.</v>

561
00:36:13.251 --> 00:36:14.150
He was thunderstruck

562
00:36:18.130 --> 00:36:18.310
<v 21>[inaudible]</v>

563
00:36:18.310 --> 00:36:19.121
<v 5>wow.</v>

564
00:36:19.121 --> 00:36:23.980
So Myron had no idea that he was experiencing the world slower than the rest of

565
00:36:23.981 --> 00:36:26.260
us. Not into all of our staple, all the pictures.

566
00:36:26.480 --> 00:36:31.480
Do we flip book and go and spit up time and then Myron can see what it was he

567
00:36:31.781 --> 00:36:33.400
was doing. But you know,

568
00:36:33.820 --> 00:36:37.150
does a turtle know that he's processing slowly?

569
00:36:37.151 --> 00:36:40.360
Does a hummingbird know that it's processing fast? I don't. I don't think so.

570
00:36:40.480 --> 00:36:41.920
Huh. But he, in this case,

571
00:36:41.921 --> 00:36:46.921
we now know that this is a human being absorbing and performing a drastically

572
00:36:47.141 --> 00:36:49.150
different tempos from the rest of humanity.

573
00:36:51.850 --> 00:36:52.310
<v 21>[inaudible]</v>

574
00:36:52.310 --> 00:36:55.460
<v 5>Oliver has another patient did it, likes to talk about, her name</v>

575
00:36:55.810 --> 00:36:58.000
<v 4>is Hester y and Hesta.</v>

576
00:36:58.330 --> 00:37:01.240
She would have the opposite of the slowing or glaciation.

577
00:37:01.420 --> 00:37:06.160
She would move with extreme speed. And uh, this came out very,

578
00:37:06.161 --> 00:37:07.030
very clearly.

579
00:37:07.300 --> 00:37:11.260
Sometimes when I had these students play ball with Hesta,

580
00:37:12.370 --> 00:37:16.330
does that mean um, they catch you? Yeah, they play catch. I'm sorry.

581
00:37:16.331 --> 00:37:18.970
Is that the wrong word? Ball Bruce?

582
00:37:18.971 --> 00:37:23.230
One of the striking things when people are Parkinsonian is when people may

583
00:37:23.231 --> 00:37:27.850
appear unable to initiate any action they can reciprocate.

584
00:37:28.090 --> 00:37:31.000
And if you suddenly throw a ball to someone of parkinsonism,

585
00:37:31.240 --> 00:37:34.330
even if they appear absolutely frozen, they will catch it.

586
00:37:34.510 --> 00:37:36.910
And often I would demonstrate this to the students.

587
00:37:37.030 --> 00:37:41.560
I would usually have seven or eight students and we would usually sit in a

588
00:37:41.561 --> 00:37:43.720
semicircle around the patient.

589
00:37:43.721 --> 00:37:48.490
So hesta would be in her chair with a semicircle students facing her.

590
00:37:49.030 --> 00:37:49.601
And she was,

591
00:37:49.601 --> 00:37:54.601
she was so quick and the ball came back and hit the student on his throwing

592
00:37:55.001 --> 00:37:56.170
hands. Wow.

593
00:37:56.470 --> 00:37:58.290
<v 5>So the guy throws the bullet Hester,</v>

594
00:37:58.300 --> 00:38:02.710
she catches the ball and throws it back before he's even put his hand back in

595
00:38:02.711 --> 00:38:06.700
place. Just so how many times faster is Hester moving than the students?

596
00:38:07.320 --> 00:38:09.880
<v 4>Um, well, let me put it in general terms.</v>

597
00:38:10.150 --> 00:38:14.080
Her reaction time is a 10th of a second or less.

598
00:38:14.410 --> 00:38:18.790
And usually the best reaction times have Olympic athletes is about a seventh of

599
00:38:18.791 --> 00:38:22.240
a second. Anyhow, the ball came back very,

600
00:38:22.241 --> 00:38:27.130
very fast and I would say to Hesta, slow down. You're too quick for them.

601
00:38:27.340 --> 00:38:31.390
Why don't you count up to 10 pause before you throw the ball back.

602
00:38:31.391 --> 00:38:34.960
Count up to 10. She's still in her very speedy mode was like, okay, okay.

603
00:38:35.290 --> 00:38:37.600
And the ball would come back, scarcity slower.

604
00:38:38.560 --> 00:38:41.650
And I would say I asked you to count up to 10 and in a voice,

605
00:38:41.651 --> 00:38:44.590
which I really can't imitate, but this is the crushed voice.

606
00:38:44.860 --> 00:38:48.010
The technical term is tech, Ophelia [inaudible] speech, uh,

607
00:38:48.120 --> 00:38:51.160
and the crushed voice of extreme parkinsonism.

608
00:38:53.380 --> 00:38:57.400
[inaudible] Hopson I can't speak quick enough for that. And her brain,

609
00:38:57.520 --> 00:38:59.950
was she thinking that she was giving normal speech? Yeah,

610
00:39:00.250 --> 00:39:05.250
she was no more conscious of her speed than mountain was of his slowness.

611
00:39:08.400 --> 00:39:09.233
<v 21>[inaudible]</v>

612
00:39:09.590 --> 00:39:10.010
<v 3>Huh?</v>

613
00:39:10.010 --> 00:39:15.010
So Myron has somehow slipped into whale time or turtle time because of the

614
00:39:15.471 --> 00:39:16.304
disease,

615
00:39:16.430 --> 00:39:19.970
which sent Hester in the opposite direction into a kind of hummingbird tempo.

616
00:39:20.780 --> 00:39:22.520
Do you think there's a limit to this?

617
00:39:22.730 --> 00:39:25.910
How fast she can go or how slow he must be.

618
00:39:25.911 --> 00:39:28.040
Like some kind of physical limits.

619
00:39:28.400 --> 00:39:32.900
If she wanted to say 20,000 words in a second and could even get her brain to do

620
00:39:32.901 --> 00:39:35.840
so, her mouth wouldn't work that her tongue wouldn't work that fast.

621
00:39:36.050 --> 00:39:39.890
So there's constraints like gravity, energy, the nature of your body.

622
00:39:40.010 --> 00:39:44.570
So there we are, the rest of us, uh, what kind of range is available to Uri

623
00:39:48.160 --> 00:39:48.300
<v 21>[inaudible]</v>

624
00:39:48.300 --> 00:39:53.300
<v 4>I am not sure that such a radical slowing speedings occur in the rest of us,</v>

625
00:39:55.980 --> 00:39:59.460
except perhaps in very unusual circumstances,

626
00:39:59.850 --> 00:40:03.780
perhaps in sports and perhaps in situations of, of mortal danger.

627
00:40:04.260 --> 00:40:05.760
People who are in the zone,

628
00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:10.620
they may give descriptions of what appears to be a baseball comes towards one at

629
00:40:10.621 --> 00:40:15.510
a hundred miles an hour, but some batters they call it batters. Yeah.

630
00:40:15.690 --> 00:40:18.750
Okay. Um, uh, people at Bat. Okay.

631
00:40:18.900 --> 00:40:23.900
But people at Bat may say that the Borg seem to come to them more slowly and

632
00:40:24.091 --> 00:40:26.370
they could see the seams on the ball

633
00:40:27.190 --> 00:40:30.010
<v 3>in the zone. Robert, I just so happen to have something here,</v>

634
00:40:30.040 --> 00:40:32.380
which is a perfect illustration of what he's talking about.

635
00:40:32.880 --> 00:40:37.360
[inaudible] except it's not baseball has to do with track tracks. Good.

636
00:40:38.050 --> 00:40:38.883
Here's the short extra.

637
00:40:40.050 --> 00:40:43.800
<v 14>When I'm up they call my name, I step up on the runway.</v>

638
00:40:44.310 --> 00:40:48.460
Usually it's just [inaudible] relax,

639
00:40:48.940 --> 00:40:53.940
you are the best plant and I don't think anything else after that.

640
00:40:56.240 --> 00:40:57.290
<v 8>I want that adrenaline coming.</v>

641
00:40:57.320 --> 00:41:01.820
When he says let us take the mark cause I only got 10 seconds at one 90 seconds

642
00:41:01.950 --> 00:41:03.320
at at that point, you know.

643
00:41:03.650 --> 00:41:06.140
But if this pump and pump and pump and pump and then they say take your mark

644
00:41:06.141 --> 00:41:07.910
when I'm exhausted. You know,

645
00:41:07.911 --> 00:41:11.390
once I get numb blocks it's like I don't want to be exhausted.

646
00:41:11.510 --> 00:41:15.650
I want to be on fire at that moment. So I'm like I'm ready. I'm ready.

647
00:41:16.120 --> 00:41:17.330
Tim's just 52 degrees,

648
00:41:17.750 --> 00:41:22.730
50 degrees out here and bod is warmed up sitting in the Blas and like colon in

649
00:41:22.731 --> 00:41:23.564
any phrasing me,

650
00:41:23.600 --> 00:41:27.290
I don't even feel no cold cause I got so much adrenaline going through my body.

651
00:41:27.291 --> 00:41:30.080
I'm just ready to put it to them today. Put everybody

652
00:41:30.180 --> 00:41:31.150
<v 14>and if you're not ready,</v>

653
00:41:31.330 --> 00:41:33.470
it doesn't matter at this point because you have to be Rick.

654
00:41:35.830 --> 00:41:40.510
<v 8>And when he says set, sit, sit in that bait gun,</v>

655
00:41:40.520 --> 00:41:45.160
go out, all you got, you just,

656
00:41:45.320 --> 00:41:47.300
just take it off from you're done. Just hold on.

657
00:41:48.220 --> 00:41:50.570
You go feel the strength that day. [inaudible] go slow down,

658
00:41:50.780 --> 00:41:52.280
no fatigue and nothing's going to come over.

659
00:41:52.780 --> 00:41:57.020
Whoever's in the lanes behind they go get it. And just listening, get in tune,

660
00:41:57.021 --> 00:42:01.580
get in tune, listen to the whole question of the crowd is get quiet for the gun.

661
00:42:02.860 --> 00:42:07.180
<v 16>In that moment when they say, take your mark set, I become the gun.</v>

662
00:42:08.380 --> 00:42:11.140
So when that gun fires,

663
00:42:11.710 --> 00:42:16.000
it's almost like I'm the bullet being fired out of the pistol.

664
00:42:17.020 --> 00:42:20.740
And that's my reaction. When I hear that sound,

665
00:42:20.770 --> 00:42:25.720
it's almost like there's a firing pin smacking me in my butt and pushing me.

666
00:42:26.170 --> 00:42:28.990
So it's not that I sound out everything around me.

667
00:42:29.140 --> 00:42:32.890
I've already sounded out everything because I'm the bullet and it's only me in

668
00:42:32.891 --> 00:42:35.110
the chamber. You line up,

669
00:42:36.070 --> 00:42:41.070
<v 8>you hear the guy men say fit and at that point you become blind and deaf because</v>

670
00:42:41.561 --> 00:42:42.100
you don't,

671
00:42:42.100 --> 00:42:47.100
you don't go off of what you think you've heard because if you do that you just

672
00:42:47.291 --> 00:42:52.240
lost the race. You have to be one with the gun. And when he says set,

673
00:42:53.350 --> 00:42:57.130
I just breathe all the air and I take a deep inhale,

674
00:42:59.470 --> 00:43:03.280
take one last look on the competitors in the lane, know focused,

675
00:43:03.750 --> 00:43:08.620
just take a drive and go drive and go. And then I hold my breath and then

676
00:43:15.370 --> 00:43:16.660
[inaudible] I let all the air out.

677
00:43:17.040 --> 00:43:19.360
That's when I started running as fast as I can.

678
00:43:19.840 --> 00:43:24.840
When you're running and you're so relaxed in what you do

679
00:43:26.490 --> 00:43:30.510
<v 1>to where a song can just pop into your mind about 30 meters,</v>

680
00:43:31.260 --> 00:43:34.290
that is the ultimate point I think the athlete wants to be.

681
00:43:34.470 --> 00:43:36.480
Cause that's when you get that peak performance.

682
00:43:37.350 --> 00:43:41.940
It's almost like everything is moving in slow motion and you watching the birds

683
00:43:41.970 --> 00:43:46.740
kind of slowly fly by and you hear that song just whistle in the yet year.

684
00:43:46.770 --> 00:43:51.390
When I take off and I start to climb in the air, it all goes pretty fast,

685
00:43:51.391 --> 00:43:56.391
but once I hit that apex of the jump and my hips are up over the bar,

686
00:43:57.360 --> 00:43:58.650
time really slows down.

687
00:43:58.651 --> 00:44:03.651
I mean you can just feel this rotation and it feels like someone's grabbed a

688
00:44:04.230 --> 00:44:06.690
hold of your hips and really giving you a push,

689
00:44:06.691 --> 00:44:11.691
a boost up in the air and for this moment that you're sort of suspended on top

690
00:44:14.400 --> 00:44:17.880
of the bar. It's really serene. It's really almost peaceful.

691
00:44:18.720 --> 00:44:20.730
It just seems like it lasts an eternity.

692
00:44:23.330 --> 00:44:24.590
<v 8>Come off the turn. I'm in the front,</v>

693
00:44:24.591 --> 00:44:27.450
I'm in the front and nobody coming from me to stop and do that. Cheetah,

694
00:44:28.020 --> 00:44:30.410
I'm in the front, so I'm just thinking, just get away. Just get away.

695
00:44:30.411 --> 00:44:33.990
Just get away, tone out the, hold on, hold on. Just stretch it out. Start.

696
00:44:33.991 --> 00:44:36.480
Get your top of her tone afterwards. Hold on, hold on.

697
00:44:41.820 --> 00:44:42.990
Hold on though.

698
00:44:42.991 --> 00:44:46.030
Is happening and trying to get your ideas that you defined them off to be fine

699
00:44:47.640 --> 00:44:50.910
at the end. Yes, yes. Compete, compete,

700
00:44:50.911 --> 00:44:55.420
compete mainly at the Tate and goals.

701
00:44:56.790 --> 00:45:00.540
Then they put them on across the largest smile. I was smiling.

702
00:45:00.920 --> 00:45:01.920
Get down to the tape.

703
00:45:07.380 --> 00:45:08.213
Yeah.

704
00:45:12.050 --> 00:45:13.820
Well that's, that's kind of stuff I live for.

705
00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:16.080
I live for those intense moments like there again,

706
00:45:22.660 --> 00:45:26.650
<v 20>it's hard to excel the fence. Sometimes they too are human,</v>

707
00:45:27.520 --> 00:45:32.520
but it's true and I've had a heart surgery in year 2000 but as athletes and you

708
00:45:34.031 --> 00:45:35.320
can ask almost any athlete,

709
00:45:35.490 --> 00:45:39.700
they'll tell you we believe we're invincible because if we go in there with any

710
00:45:39.701 --> 00:45:40.534
other thought,

711
00:45:40.840 --> 00:45:44.860
there's no chance of us compensating because we have to believe.

712
00:45:44.861 --> 00:45:49.861
We have to confuse ourselves into believing that no matter what's wrong with you

713
00:45:51.630 --> 00:45:55.210
or what you're dealing with is not going to be a factor to what you're trying to

714
00:45:55.211 --> 00:45:56.044
accomplish.

715
00:46:00.050 --> 00:46:01.670
We believe we're invisible.

716
00:46:07.080 --> 00:46:08.940
<v 3>Thanks for the next big thing and sound artists.</v>

717
00:46:09.540 --> 00:46:13.140
Ben Ruben for that a piece he produced for the national track and Field Hall of

718
00:46:13.141 --> 00:46:17.280
fame, you can visit them on the web@trackhall.com so Robert,

719
00:46:17.281 --> 00:46:18.630
what do you think this was a case?

720
00:46:18.631 --> 00:46:23.631
I think of athletes showing you how we contest with time get power by mastering

721
00:46:26.610 --> 00:46:30.540
time shaving. It's slightly time and power, have a long history.

722
00:46:30.541 --> 00:46:33.750
That's what we'll look at shortly. I'm jacked up on Ron Robert Krulwich.

723
00:46:33.751 --> 00:46:34.830
Now back in a moment

724
00:46:36.670 --> 00:46:40.190
to you're the same to radio lab.

00:47:08.820 --> 00:47:12.170
This is Radiolab. I'm Chad. Boom. Rod. My guest today is Robert Crowe,

732
00:47:12.171 --> 00:47:14.520
which the science correspondent for ABC News,

733
00:47:14.850 --> 00:47:17.550
Nova and Nightline and we're talking about time,

734
00:47:17.640 --> 00:47:22.470
the freezing of the speeding up of the slung down of the absorbed science of

735
00:47:22.880 --> 00:47:26.640
another politics of time. Speaking of which my interview with,

736
00:47:26.641 --> 00:47:30.220
remember Jay Griffiths when we heard in the previous section, she began

737
00:47:30.220 --> 00:47:34.210
<v 5>her interview with me with a strange declaration which she read off a piece of</v>

738
00:47:34.211 --> 00:47:35.040
paper.

739
00:47:35.040 --> 00:47:37.410
<v 12>This is the independent free state of troll. Haim,</v>

740
00:47:37.440 --> 00:47:40.620
we have no allegiance to the government. We do not recognize history,

741
00:47:40.621 --> 00:47:44.700
patriarchy, matriarchy politics, communist, fascist or lollipop men or ladies.

742
00:47:45.150 --> 00:47:47.550
We have a hierarchy based on dog worship.

743
00:47:47.580 --> 00:47:50.310
Our currency is to be based on the cog barter system.

744
00:47:50.640 --> 00:47:55.640
We do not recognize the Gregorian calendar by doing so this day shall be known

745
00:47:56.191 --> 00:48:00.090
as one. Be Afraid, be afraid, all that here,

746
00:48:00.150 --> 00:48:04.530
respect this date. What was that?

747
00:48:04.920 --> 00:48:07.660
That was the manifesto of um,

748
00:48:08.040 --> 00:48:11.730
British anti road protests in the mid nineties.

749
00:48:11.760 --> 00:48:15.840
The British anti road protest? Yes. Like roads. Yes.

750
00:48:15.841 --> 00:48:19.260
Environmentalist who were protesting against the building of roads and one of

751
00:48:19.261 --> 00:48:23.070
the things that they chose to do was to write this self-governing manifesto.

752
00:48:23.490 --> 00:48:28.030
Pointing out that for them they were not going to recognize Greenwich Mean Time,

753
00:48:28.700 --> 00:48:33.440
<v 23>three hours, 44 minutes. I reckon they did. Universal time.</v>

754
00:48:34.860 --> 00:48:37.650
<v 12>Time is a highly political subject.</v>

755
00:48:38.340 --> 00:48:40.590
It initially was the British sense of time,

756
00:48:40.950 --> 00:48:43.350
which was transported all over the world.

757
00:48:44.310 --> 00:48:46.710
Britons ruled their empire through ruling the oceans.

758
00:48:46.711 --> 00:48:50.250
They rule the oceans because they discovered chronometer as of sufficient

759
00:48:50.280 --> 00:48:52.370
accuracy to discover longitude.

760
00:48:52.830 --> 00:48:57.570
What the British did in their empires was to insist on GMT,

761
00:48:57.630 --> 00:48:59.280
Greenwich Meantime, and you know,

762
00:48:59.460 --> 00:49:01.790
the that are the countries where sort of [inaudible] Greenwich mean time

763
00:49:01.880 --> 00:49:04.490
retarded a bit or advanced a bit, but essentially

764
00:49:06.370 --> 00:49:09.320
[inaudible] was a real slam in London and [inaudible] questions the British

765
00:49:09.321 --> 00:49:12.020
don't on the season anymore, but we all still use Greenwich mean time.

766
00:49:12.021 --> 00:49:13.490
So absolutely.

767
00:49:14.480 --> 00:49:17.930
We're very used to thinking that empires are to do with land.

768
00:49:18.200 --> 00:49:21.920
What I'm arguing is that actually though there have been empires of time

769
00:49:24.630 --> 00:49:24.840
<v 0>[inaudible],</v>

770
00:49:24.840 --> 00:49:27.580
<v 5>there's one story you tell about the rulers.</v>

771
00:49:27.610 --> 00:49:31.240
This is the ruler of trick menace than the current ruler of Turkmenistan.

772
00:49:31.510 --> 00:49:33.550
A guy named president Neosoft.

773
00:49:33.580 --> 00:49:38.580
Now the month of January in Turkmenistan is called Turkmenbashi and the month of

774
00:49:40.300 --> 00:49:43.540
April is called Gerben. [inaudible]. Why are they called that?

775
00:49:43.740 --> 00:49:46.320
<v 12>Well, he named one after himself and one after his mother.</v>

776
00:49:48.060 --> 00:49:50.480
You mean everybody there? So in January calls it, you know,

777
00:49:50.820 --> 00:49:52.920
president of our country month, whatever. Well,

778
00:49:52.921 --> 00:49:56.670
I don't actually know whether you know that it's taken off in the street as it

779
00:49:56.880 --> 00:50:01.020
were and I rather suspect it probably hasn't. But what he wanted to do was,

780
00:50:01.320 --> 00:50:06.320
what in fact many rulers have run to do is to ally themselves with the clock and

781
00:50:08.101 --> 00:50:12.600
the calendar. I mean, like Paul Pot decided that 97, 55 years zero,

782
00:50:13.520 --> 00:50:16.680
Paul Potts says, all right, everything starts with me. Yes, exactly.

783
00:50:16.681 --> 00:50:17.910
Everything starts with me.

784
00:50:17.940 --> 00:50:22.500
Now when I say it does this is year zero and to you, I guess

785
00:50:23.200 --> 00:50:28.100
<v 5>the joy of time, the deepest, most ecstatic version of</v>

786
00:50:28.100 --> 00:50:32.090
<v 12>it is when you lose it completely. I think that's absolutely right.</v>

787
00:50:32.150 --> 00:50:33.980
And I think that's something that, um, you know,

788
00:50:34.280 --> 00:50:38.300
that in prayer and meditation in art, um,

789
00:50:38.450 --> 00:50:43.130
and in love actually is that people lose that. Um, very,

790
00:50:43.760 --> 00:50:44.720
um, you know,

791
00:50:44.721 --> 00:50:49.610
fretful ticking off kind of sense of clock time and what you fall into,

792
00:50:50.020 --> 00:50:53.300
um, is, is something transcendent. You know,

793
00:50:53.301 --> 00:50:58.301
all that you have to have done is loved somebody to know that and to hold them

794
00:50:59.121 --> 00:50:59.870
for half an hour.

795
00:50:59.870 --> 00:51:02.780
And you could know that that half an hour has lasted an eternity

796
00:51:03.050 --> 00:51:05.490
<v 3>time. Standing still in a moment like that is like a,</v>

797
00:51:05.870 --> 00:51:08.930
a really swollen now.

798
00:51:09.040 --> 00:51:13.640
<v 12>Yes, exactly. Exactly. And that in a sense, you know, that's when, um,</v>

799
00:51:13.720 --> 00:51:17.800
the moment meets the eternal th that that is all that matters is just this

800
00:51:17.801 --> 00:51:20.080
moment that you're holding in your hand.

801
00:51:22.850 --> 00:51:24.470
<v 3>Thanks Robert. That was great. Yeah. Thank you.</v>

802
00:51:25.550 --> 00:51:28.310
Jay Griffiths is the author of a sideways look at time.

803
00:51:28.311 --> 00:51:30.410
You can find out more about her on our website,

804
00:51:30.440 --> 00:51:33.950
radiolab.org we'll close our program today on time.

805
00:51:33.951 --> 00:51:37.880
The way we started with an excerpt of the performance is Beethoven's ninth

806
00:51:37.881 --> 00:51:38.714
symphony.

807
00:51:38.840 --> 00:51:42.350
You know the one [inaudible] except this is not the way Beethoven would have

808
00:51:42.351 --> 00:51:43.700
intended it to be performed.

809
00:51:44.060 --> 00:51:48.170
The piece he wrote to last 70 minutes has been stretched to 24 hours.

810
00:51:48.200 --> 00:51:52.310
24 hours. Yup. Bringing it even closer to eternity.

811
00:51:52.700 --> 00:51:57.320
Recently a group of San Franciscans spent an entire weekend in a gallery in a

812
00:51:57.321 --> 00:52:01.520
trance listening to all 24 hours and began on a Friday evening.

813
00:52:01.760 --> 00:52:06.290
It is one oh two in the morning through the light all night.

814
00:52:06.780 --> 00:52:09.330
So it's about three 45 in the morning, three 55

815
00:52:09.370 --> 00:52:10.330
<v 24>in the morning, like in the morning.</v>

816
00:52:10.670 --> 00:52:11.503
<v 3>Sound artist.</v>

817
00:52:11.870 --> 00:52:15.650
Aaron Zim was there otherwise known as the quiet American performances at his

818
00:52:15.651 --> 00:52:17.870
gallery. In fact, close our show today.

819
00:52:17.871 --> 00:52:22.160
We asked him to give us a taste of what it sounded like. It starts with his

820
00:52:23.900 --> 00:52:27.860
[inaudible] and then that I'm Duh, Duh, Duh Duh Duh Duh. But you know,

821
00:52:27.861 --> 00:52:29.770
here it's like mm.

822
00:52:29.870 --> 00:52:33.170
<v 2>Even though it's like a very simple thing to do to like say, okay,</v>

823
00:52:33.171 --> 00:52:37.880
it's not going to be 90 minutes, it's going to be a day. It,

824
00:52:38.150 --> 00:52:43.150
it still gives you that sense of floating time or hanging time at a time that

825
00:52:44.780 --> 00:52:49.460
uh, that takes a long time to pass that you haven't certain places in your life

826
00:52:50.120 --> 00:52:53.100
where major thing happens. You know? Volks that's

827
00:53:07.870 --> 00:53:08.703
<v 0>[inaudible]</v>

828
00:53:09.040 --> 00:53:12.030
<v 24>you know how people report that, uh, you,</v>

829
00:53:12.050 --> 00:53:14.730
your life flashes before your eyes in a car crash or something like that.

830
00:53:15.560 --> 00:53:16.950
Time seem to slow down for people.

831
00:53:17.110 --> 00:53:20.580
It's like these really tense moments when if you happen to be playing

832
00:53:20.700 --> 00:53:24.090
Beethoven's ninth symphony on like a, your car stereo,

833
00:53:24.690 --> 00:53:26.880
well you were into some car crash or something.

834
00:53:27.540 --> 00:53:29.400
Would it slow down and sound like this?

835
00:53:40.100 --> 00:53:40.933
<v 0>[inaudible]</v>

836
00:53:46.020 --> 00:53:51.020
<v 25>the idea was to stretch something to 24 hours by stretching Beethoven's ninth I</v>

837
00:53:51.241 --> 00:53:54.870
don't only Rach a piece of music stretch music history. Oh God,

838
00:53:54.871 --> 00:53:56.580
Beethoven for 24 hours.

839
00:53:56.640 --> 00:54:00.570
I'm just wondering if Beethoven is slowly spinning in his grave. Low Finger.

840
00:54:01.020 --> 00:54:04.870
That's my name here in San Francisco this weekend. This is [inaudible]

841
00:54:04.930 --> 00:54:09.910
<v 3>second fool 24 over performance upstairs where the performance is going on has a</v>

842
00:54:09.911 --> 00:54:12.250
good five. Everything seems very gentle.

843
00:54:12.310 --> 00:54:15.340
If Laura is completely covered with bean bags or pillows,

844
00:54:15.560 --> 00:54:19.240
this space has a really amazing acoustic sound system. He was really good.

845
00:54:19.360 --> 00:54:23.650
What can I say? Designed to be contemplative. Why would I do this?

846
00:54:23.710 --> 00:54:27.640
I have no idea why. When doing it you will. I do it again. I don't know.

847
00:54:27.700 --> 00:54:31.870
I want to see how I feel being exposed to one unique pieces.

848
00:54:31.871 --> 00:54:34.390
First responses, very calming response.

849
00:54:34.420 --> 00:54:36.840
And then when I walked in and then I came in, I thought it was,

850
00:54:36.850 --> 00:54:40.380
I wanted to stretch, open up and

851
00:54:42.210 --> 00:54:43.043
expand

852
00:55:05.200 --> 00:55:06.033
<v 0>[inaudible] [inaudible]</v>

853
00:55:13.820 --> 00:55:18.680
<v 24>so I had this thought that different animals based on probably their size and</v>

854
00:55:18.681 --> 00:55:21.470
their heart rate might have different senses of time.

855
00:55:21.471 --> 00:55:25.760
Like you see a hummingbird zipping around in this manic way and you think we

856
00:55:25.761 --> 00:55:28.430
humans must seem very slow to that hummingbird.

857
00:55:28.910 --> 00:55:32.630
Everything we do must almost be in slow motion to something that can just deal

858
00:55:32.631 --> 00:55:37.631
with things that quickly and to a whale or some huge animal with a heart rate

859
00:55:37.851 --> 00:55:41.060
that is like once every few minutes, we must seem really fast.

860
00:55:41.240 --> 00:55:43.880
This piece is kind of like that.

861
00:55:43.910 --> 00:55:48.910
Suddenly I felt like I was moving at hummingbird speed touchdown.

862
00:55:49.570 --> 00:55:54.040
It's getting this growing and growing and growing and you're just wanting a tick

863
00:55:56.500 --> 00:55:58.780
and it's not going to right. It is rather,

864
00:55:58.781 --> 00:56:02.650
it is climaxing but it's just taking place over such a long time.

865
00:56:02.651 --> 00:56:04.960
That to us in our little small human time,

866
00:56:04.961 --> 00:56:07.610
it doesn't feel like it's climaxing and it's true. It doesn't really,

867
00:56:07.780 --> 00:56:09.640
the climax never really happens.

868
00:56:12.410 --> 00:56:16.400
<v 3>It's like you flare. Right Steve. Nice people. That's why, I don't know.</v>

869
00:56:16.580 --> 00:56:21.020
Maybe somebody else ran out screaming. I'm really biased. I'm serious.

870
00:56:21.530 --> 00:56:24.190
Oh, it's like an ecstatic. Other times

871
00:56:24.190 --> 00:56:29.190
<v 0>it felt like between them and continued to [inaudible] was lifted up for sure.</v>

872
00:56:29.940 --> 00:56:33.300
Just a constant lifted with them. There was no end.

873
00:56:35.560 --> 00:56:37.900
Just a constant lifting, lifting.

874
00:56:53.050 --> 00:56:53.883
[inaudible]

875
00:57:04.180 --> 00:57:06.460
<v 3>just got quiet. Yeah.</v>

876
00:57:07.230 --> 00:57:10.650
It sounded like it was supposed to go quiet there. Yeah,

877
00:57:10.860 --> 00:57:15.030
it'll be a stretched out quiet. Yeah. It's probably just like a rest.

878
00:57:15.870 --> 00:57:18.720
Yeah. However many times.

879
00:57:19.170 --> 00:57:21.290
Longer camps. Again,

880
00:57:27.710 --> 00:57:28.543
<v 0>[inaudible]</v>

881
00:57:30.900 --> 00:57:35.090
<v 8>that was produced by sound artist, Aaron Zim with help from Bronwyn's,</v>

882
00:57:35.310 --> 00:57:38.340
him and Jeremiah Moore. You can find more of Aaron's work on our website,

883
00:57:38.341 --> 00:57:39.690
radiolab.org chat.

884
00:57:39.691 --> 00:57:44.160
I was actually going to be the long a vowel and the all the mention sequence

885
00:57:44.520 --> 00:57:46.110
that I was unable to make it to San Francisco.

886
00:57:48.450 --> 00:57:51.180
