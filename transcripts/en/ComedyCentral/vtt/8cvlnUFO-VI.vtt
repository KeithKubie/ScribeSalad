00:00:03.269 --> 00:00:06.006 line:0%
 (tinny upbeat music)

00:00:07.706 --> 00:00:10.109
- Woo hoo, April, baby!

00:00:10.142 --> 00:00:11.577
Okay, so I just saw on this site

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.212
that rhubarbs are in season now.

00:00:13.245 --> 00:00:16.482
 Finally, I'm gonna make a pie.

00:00:16.515 --> 00:00:18.584 align:start size:88% position:13%
 I thought you
 wanted to make pie?

00:00:18.617 --> 00:00:19.519 size:88% position:44%
  Are you all right?

00:00:19.552 --> 00:00:20.820
- I have to say something, Abbi.

00:00:20.853 --> 00:00:23.623
 It's hard to say, but (sighs)

00:00:23.656 --> 00:00:25.691 align:start size:88% position:13%
 I just feel like
 we've been hanging out

00:00:25.724 --> 00:00:27.093
too much lately.

00:00:27.126 --> 00:00:30.129 size:88% position:44%
  I mean, it's been
  like all the time,

00:00:30.162 --> 00:00:31.831 size:88% position:44%
  every fuckin' day.

00:00:31.864 --> 00:00:34.567 align:start size:88% position:13%
Are we even individuals
any more, you know?

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.070
Or are we just one fused brain?

00:00:37.103 --> 00:00:39.272 align:start size:88% position:13%
  We've reached a
  tipping point and,

00:00:39.305 --> 00:00:40.473 size:84% position:42%
  this is the hardest part!

00:00:40.506 --> 00:00:42.108 size:88% position:44%
 But

00:00:42.141 --> 00:00:44.477 align:start size:88% position:13%
 I think we need a
 break, a friend break,

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:46.179
where we take a week off

00:00:46.212 --> 00:00:47.713
 of talking, texting,

00:00:47.746 --> 00:00:50.116 size:88% position:44%
 phone conversation and even

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:51.684 size:88% position:44%
  IRL hangs.

00:00:51.717 --> 00:00:53.386
 No letters, no cards.

00:00:53.419 --> 00:00:57.490
 A friend break, just
 for a week. (sighs)

00:00:57.523 --> 00:00:58.758
- You know what?

00:00:58.791 --> 00:01:01.794 align:start size:88% position:13%
 I've kind of been
 feeling the same way.

00:01:01.827 --> 00:01:03.596
 I think that this is
 a really great idea.

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:04.797 size:88% position:44%
  - Are you kidding?

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.766 size:84% position:42%
  That was an April Fool's!

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:08.201
You were supposed to go,

00:01:08.234 --> 00:01:09.435 size:88% position:44%
 "Oh, my God, never,
 I'd die for you!"

00:01:09.468 --> 00:01:11.671 align:start size:88% position:13%
 and then I'd be
 like, April Fool's!

00:01:11.704 --> 00:01:14.240
 But you really feel that way?

00:01:14.273 --> 00:01:15.475
 - No, no no,

00:01:15.508 --> 00:01:16.709
 I was kidding!

00:01:16.742 --> 00:01:18.644
April Fool's! (yelling)

00:01:18.677 --> 00:01:20.847
 You got fooled, you the fool!

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.715
 Foolish, yay, we play.

00:01:24.783 --> 00:01:25.685
Oh, man.

00:01:25.718 --> 00:01:27.720 size:84% position:42%
  I win, I'm the fool king!

00:01:27.753 --> 00:01:30.156 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Oh, you got me, dude.
- Woo!

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:33.292 align:start size:88% position:13%
- We did the same April
Fool's, oh my God.

00:01:33.325 --> 00:01:34.760 size:88% position:44%
 I feel even closer.

00:01:34.793 --> 00:01:36.863 size:88% position:44%
  We gotta hang out
  every day forever.

00:01:36.896 --> 00:01:39.665 size:88% position:44%
  Otherwise I'm gonna blow
  brains out. (imitates gun)

00:01:39.698 --> 00:01:41.300
- Not if I blow mine out

00:01:41.333 --> 00:01:42.668
 first.
 - Oh.

00:01:42.701 --> 00:01:44.604
 Okay, I'm comin' over.

00:01:44.637 --> 00:01:45.638
 - That sounds great.

00:01:45.671 --> 00:01:46.673
 See ya soon.

00:01:49.775 --> 00:01:51.811
(tuts) Really didn't
need to smash the bowl.

00:01:51.844 --> 00:01:55.215
 (tinny upbeat music)
