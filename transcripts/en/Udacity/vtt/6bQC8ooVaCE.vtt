00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:04.740
Here are the four perfect squares. Great job if you got those correct. We know

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.260
we can use the perfect square pattern to figure out how to write each

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:10.988
expression. We can look at the last term and take the square root of it to

00:00:10.988 --> 00:00:15.572
figure out what should go inside the parentheses. Also, since our middle term

00:00:15.572 --> 00:00:18.920
here is positive, we note that the sign that we'll use over here will also be

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:23.200
positive. And these last two cases, the sign here for the middle term was

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:26.250
negative, which means that the sign on the b term would be negative and our

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.269
answer. If you're ever in doubt if you have a perfect square, simply multiply

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:35.200
out this to see if you get this trinomial. It should work.
