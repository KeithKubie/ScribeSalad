00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:20.410
The Great Emu War 
of 1932

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:24.810
Emus are native to Australia, and as everyone
knows, nearly everything in Australia seems

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.270
capable of killing you.

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:30.250
If the sun doesn’t do it, there are still
redback spiders, funnel webs, and Taipans,

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:31.960
and others to contend with.

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:35.300
It should come as no surprise, then, that
the emu—part ostrich, part velociraptor—is

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:52.960
also an annoyance bent on making the lives
of people living in Australia miserable.

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:54.510
Emus more strongly resemble ostriches.

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.780
They are large, tall flightless birds with
long necks and fluffy feathers.

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:02.989
They live and breed in the middle portion
of Australia which is largely uninhabitable

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:04.449
by anyone with sense.

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:08.920
However, they don’t mind traveling far and
wide in search of food and water.

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:14.070
In the wake of World War I, over 5000 veterans
had set up camp on the fringes of the emus’

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.130
habitats in Western Australia.

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.080
It was part of a soldier settlement program
to help the soldiers make a living farming

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:21.080
the land.

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.900
However, drought caused many of the crops
to fail, and emus had a tendency to gobble

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.320
up what was left.

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:31.380
Unfortunately, prices of things had skyrocketed
after the war, meaning many of these ex-soldiers

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.670
couldn’t afford fences to keep the birds
out.

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:37.780
Being soldiers, they grabbed their guns and
started shooting the birds.

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:41.010
Some 3000 emus were killed in 1928.

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:46.479
However, despite these killings, by 1932,
an estimated 20,000 emus invaded the farmers’

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:49.460
fields and the bountiful food supply they
provided.

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:52.060
The farmers knew they had to do something.

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:56.030
The usual way to lodge a complaint about farming
conditions would have been to appeal to the

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:57.530
Minister of Agriculture.

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:00.869
The ex-soldier farmers didn’t trust the
Minister of Agriculture, though, so they approached

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:04.890
the Minister of Defence instead, who more
or less declared war on the birds.

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.700
He granted the farmers the use of two Lewis
machine guns and 10,000 bullets, plus the

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:13.379
expertise of two gunners and Major G.P.W.

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:14.379
Meredith.

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:17.510
Given these resources, this was sure to be
an easy victory.

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:22.189
Meredith led the assault on the emus, only
to find that the enemy was quick and cunning.

00:02:22.189 --> 00:02:25.769
Emus enjoyed the shade of nearby trees when
they weren’t chomping on the wheat crops,

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:29.079
and with the vegetative cover, the gunners
couldn’t get a clean shot.

00:02:29.079 --> 00:02:33.190
In addition, after a few battles, the emus
seemed to work out the range of the guns—they

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:35.069
always stayed just out of that range.

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:40.779
One of the first battles ended in a spectacular
failure on the part of the Australian farmer-soldiers.

00:02:40.779 --> 00:02:45.030
About 100 emus had gathered in one place,
and the soldiers decided to ambush them with

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:49.500
one machine gun, thinking that they could
take care of most of them pretty quickly.

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:53.950
After about a dozen bullets fired, the machine
gun jammed, giving the birds ample opportunity

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:56.599
to run off, escaping to fight another day.

00:02:56.599 --> 00:03:00.909
When Meredith and his Merry Men realized how
fast the emus could run, they had the idea

00:03:00.909 --> 00:03:05.199
to attach a machine gun on the back of a moving
vehicle and chase after them.

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:07.230
Again, this tactic failed.

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:10.409
The gunman was too busy attempting to hold
on to shoot the gun.

00:03:10.409 --> 00:03:14.989
The emus raced to the relative safety of the
trees, regrouped, and scattered.

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:18.609
Even if the gunner had been able to shoot,
the vehicle would only be able to chase after

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:23.480
one bird at a time, making it impossible to
kill off a large number of birds at once.

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:26.650
Not a single bird was killed using this tactic.

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:31.379
The end result of the war was arguably that
the emus won via outlasting the humans.

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:37.420
While there were no human casualties, only
986 of the roughly 20,000 emus were killed,

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:40.980
and 9,860 bullets had been used up.

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:45.279
With an exact 10-1 ratio of bullets to dead
emu, the soldiers and the government were

00:03:45.279 --> 00:03:49.139
rightly embarrassed by the whole event and
refused to repeat the experiment in later

00:03:49.139 --> 00:03:50.139
years.

00:03:50.139 --> 00:03:53.829
Someone asked in parliament whether or not
medals would be given out for this war—another

00:03:53.829 --> 00:03:58.620
noted that medals should be given to the emus,
who had “won every round so far.”

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:02.589
Major Meredith went on to attest that the
birds could take several bullets without batting

00:04:02.589 --> 00:04:03.589
an eyelash.

00:04:03.589 --> 00:04:06.999
In fact, one bird was hit by a truck some
days after the initial shooting.

00:04:06.999 --> 00:04:11.819
The truck killed it, but when the emu was
examined they found five bullets in it.

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:13.629
Meredith is on record as saying,

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:18.440
If we had a military division with the bullet-carrying
capacity of these birds, it would face any

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:19.570
army in the world.

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:22.730
They could face machine guns with the invulnerability
of tanks.

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:26.350
They are like Zulus, whom even dum dum bullets
would not stop.

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:29.910
The emus did wander off eventually, but that
was because the wheat was harvested and they

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:34.010
had little left to eat—not because they
couldn’t stand up to the might of man and

00:04:34.010 --> 00:07:06.000
his machine gun.
