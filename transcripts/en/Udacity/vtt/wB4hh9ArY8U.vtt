00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.500
Now let's discuss some
details of the systems and

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:06.530
deployment aspects of
intrusion detection.

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:11.200
An IDS typically performs what
we call passive monitoring.

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:15.580
That is, it is recording and
analyzing data about systems and

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:20.430
network activities while these
activities continue to take place.

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.990
Only when the IDS outputs an alert and
the response policy

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.300
dictates a direct intervention,
such as blocking a connection or

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.335
terminating a program,
are the activities affected.
