00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.650
&gt;&gt;&gt; Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome vice
president of engineering for Google, Vic Gundotra.

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:18.350
[ Applause ]
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: Well, good morning.

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:20.499
Good morning.
And hello.

00:00:20.499 --> 00:00:27.390
On behalf of Google, let me extend a very
warm welcome to all 5,000 in attendance today,

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:33.440
as well as the many more thousands who are
watching our first-ever live streamcast of

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:37.269
this event on YouTube.com.
Thank you.

00:00:37.269 --> 00:00:41.989
You know, it's hard to believe that this is
our third Google I/O.

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:46.510
It's not only our largest Google I/O, it's
the one that we sold out the fastest.

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:51.089
It even surprised us.
Within weeks of announcing this conference,

00:00:51.089 --> 00:00:55.059
we sold out of this event two and a half months
in advance.

00:00:55.059 --> 00:01:01.059
We think that speaks volumes about the level
of enthusiasm that you all have for this important

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:05.890
community event.
And at Google, we recognize how precious and

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:10.160
valuable your time is, and we're honored and
grateful that you have chosen to spend two

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:14.640
days here with us.
We hope you find this conference exciting

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.830
and really engaging, and we have a few surprises
for you as well.

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.720
Now, some of you may wonder, how did we name
this conference?

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:29.590
What does I/O stand for?
Three-plus years ago, when we first thought

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:34.360
about holding a developers' conference and
we thought about naming the event, we contemplated

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:39.100
multiple choices.
We wanted a name that, most importantly, embodied

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:46.860
the spirit of the Web, a spirit of collaboration.
Sometimes messy, but always fun.

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:54.090
A spirit of inclusiveness rather than exclusiveness.
A spirit of innovation and of openness.

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.380
And, of course, we wanted this event to appeal
to developers.

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:00.610
So we thought, what's the first thing a developer
learns to do when they begin to code?

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:04.160
Well, it's input and output.
That's I/O.

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:12.890
But I/O also stands for two of the most important
elements of our Web culture: Innovation in

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:18.490
the open.
Make no mistake about it, the Web is the most

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:23.420
important platform of our generation.
And because it's a platform controlled by

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:29.030
none of us, it's the only platform that truly
belongs to all of us.

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:32.670
And it's our job as a community to move that
Web forward.

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:39.170
And so you can imagine how pleased we were
last year at this conference to focus the

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:46.430
world's attention, the developer community's
attention, on an important standard, HTML5.

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:53.350
It was at this conference in this room last
year that you can see we first started driving

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:57.210
attention toward HTML5.
And events later on in the year continued

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:04.680
that momentum that we, as a community, started.
That huge spike is YouTube's adoption of HTML5.

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:09.490
That other spike is Apple's adoption.
I think it was a Steve Jobs late-night e-mail

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:10.640
or something.
[ Laughter ]

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:14.250
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: That last spike --
[ Applause ]

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:19.090
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: Hey, we'll take support from
wherever we can get it.

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:22.780
That last spike included Microsoft's support
for HTML5.

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:29.400
As a community, working together, and collaboratively,
we can move the Web forward.

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.599
Of course, we recognize that we are far from
done.

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:37.650
We recognize that the Web has important challenges
that we need to address as a community.

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:44.330
How can we make the Web faster?
How can we make Web apps as discoverable as

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:48.970
you see, for example, in app stores?
How can we make it easier for developers to

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:54.340
monetize those applications?
And, finally, can we make the Web extend its

00:03:54.340 --> 00:04:00.850
reach even to new form factors?
We hope to show you our proposed answers to

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:05.140
some of these questions at this conference.
And we're very much looking forward to your

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:09.540
feedback.
Of course, the Web is growing up.

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:12.000
It's all happening because we're working on
it together.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.890
And we think this conference is an important
part of that process.

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:22.490
Before I hand off to our opening keynote speaker,
let me just make two housekeeping announcements.

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:27.160
The first announcement is, I hope you all
enjoyed the Android devices that we sent you

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:30.909
as part of registering.
[ Applause ]

00:04:30.909 --> 00:04:37.069
[ Cheers and applause ]
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: If you have not already done

00:04:37.069 --> 00:04:43.120
so, please go to the Android Marketplace and
download an application we specifically designed

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:48.159
for you at this conference, just do a search
on Google conference or Google I/O, and you'll

00:04:48.159 --> 00:04:51.740
find this application.
This application will make it very easy for

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:56.860
you to make the best use of your time and
to really find the sessions that interest

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:01.069
you the most.
The second and last housekeeping note, tomorrow's

00:05:01.069 --> 00:05:07.229
keynote will not start at 9:00 a.m.
It will start at 8:30 in the morning.

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:10.770
I know, that's early in the morning, particularly
for you developers.

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:17.789
But I promise you, you will not be disappointed.
We have more than one surprise tomorrow morning.

00:05:17.789 --> 00:05:23.900
So have fun at the party tonight, but remember,
the fun starts at 8:30 tomorrow morning.

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:27.389
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: All right.

00:05:27.389 --> 00:05:32.050
With that, let me hand off to our opening
keynote speaker, who will carry the banner

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:36.279
of the open Web.
Please join me in welcoming Google vice president

00:05:36.279 --> 00:05:38.409
of product management, Sundar Pichai.
[ Applause ]

00:05:38.409 --> 00:05:50.139
&gt;&gt;Sundar Pichai:

00:05:50.139 --> 00:05:52.749
Thanks, Vic.
It's great to be here.

00:05:52.749 --> 00:05:59.030
I'm going to be talking to you today about
HTML5, the incredible momentum we have, all

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:04.139
the new capabilities that are coming up, how
modern browsers are going to support these

00:06:04.139 --> 00:06:06.529
APIs.
We will show you real-world examples.

00:06:06.529 --> 00:06:11.430
We will invite application developers who
are building amazing experiences on top of

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:14.629
HTML5.
And, finally, we will have a couple of important

00:06:14.629 --> 00:06:21.680
announcements on the way.
So let's get started.

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:26.999
First, as Vic mentioned, the Web is the most
important platform of our generation.

00:06:26.999 --> 00:06:32.289
And from a user standpoint, people are spending
more of their time on the Web.

00:06:32.289 --> 00:06:36.889
Compared to every other information medium
out there, the Web is more than double in

00:06:36.889 --> 00:06:42.169
terms of the amount of time people spent in
the last five years.

00:06:42.169 --> 00:06:46.089
Every other information medium has been the
same or has declined.

00:06:46.089 --> 00:06:48.509
That's how important the Web is in users'
lives.

00:06:48.509 --> 00:06:54.520
How are developers reacting to it?
We started taking a look at how applications

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:58.849
have been written since 1990.
Most of you are familiar with the popular

00:06:58.849 --> 00:07:05.240
desktop applications: Microsoft Office, iTunes,
Skype, Photoshop.

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:08.030
The list goes on and on.
These are amazing applications which we all

00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:14.649
use in our day-to-day lives.
The interesting thing, though, is, since 2004,

00:07:14.649 --> 00:07:20.110
we can't come up with popular desktop applications,
outside of games and browsers, that are being

00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:24.159
used by millions of users.
What happened in 2004?

00:07:24.159 --> 00:07:29.259
It turned out it is the year in which Ajax
and the Web 2.0 revolution happened.

00:07:29.259 --> 00:07:34.389
People started writing these applications
as Web applications, applications which you're

00:07:34.389 --> 00:07:39.619
all very familiar with: GMail, Google Maps,
Twitter, Facebook, et cetera.

00:07:39.619 --> 00:07:43.509
The world changed.
The Web changed from documents to applications.

00:07:43.509 --> 00:07:48.779
And developers started reaching users by writing
Web applications instead of desktop applications.

00:07:48.779 --> 00:07:54.240
So this is a powerful change.
It's a very important trend.

00:07:54.240 --> 00:08:00.399
Given that, we need to make sure Web applications
can do everything that desktop applications

00:08:00.399 --> 00:08:02.719
can do.
You're all very familiar with this.

00:08:02.719 --> 00:08:07.449
Historically, desktop applications have had
full access to system capabilities.

00:08:07.449 --> 00:08:11.479
So they could talk to the speaker, microphone,
camera.

00:08:11.479 --> 00:08:15.759
They could access the file system, for example.
Web applications have been limited in what

00:08:15.759 --> 00:08:18.990
they can do.
This is what the HTML5 work is all about.

00:08:18.990 --> 00:08:24.740
We are working very hard as a community to
make sure all these capabilities show up in

00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:27.399
the browser.
Let me give a few examples.

00:08:27.399 --> 00:08:33.169
Most computers today ship with powerful GPUs.
How do you make sure Web applications can

00:08:33.169 --> 00:08:37.839
access these graphics capabilities?
That's what Web GL and the graphics APIs are

00:08:37.839 --> 00:08:42.001
all about.
Workers, it is about allowing Web applications

00:08:42.001 --> 00:08:45.980
to access the multi-core CPUs present on the
computers.

00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:52.750
There are APIs to access the local file system,
local storage, speaker, microphone, camera,

00:08:52.750 --> 00:08:57.380
and the list goes on.
All this matters only if browsers support

00:08:57.380 --> 00:09:02.069
these APIs.
So let's take a look at how we are doing there.

00:09:02.069 --> 00:09:06.290
About 24 months ago, this had just gotten
under way.

00:09:06.290 --> 00:09:12.060
There was pioneering work here by Firefox,
Safari, Opera, and Chrome didn't even exist

00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:15.050
then.
So this is about 24 months ago, and it had

00:09:15.050 --> 00:09:19.589
just gotten under way.
Let's fast forward to where we were last year

00:09:19.589 --> 00:09:23.040
during Google I/O.
You can see the momentum was there.

00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:28.089
Set of APIs being implemented in all modern
browsers, including Chrome.

00:09:28.089 --> 00:09:31.990
So the progress was very exciting.
So where do we expect to be by the end of

00:09:31.990 --> 00:09:36.800
this year?
As you can see, all the major APIs are going

00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:39.899
to be present in all modern browsers.
So --

00:09:39.899 --> 00:09:42.560
[ Laughter ]
[ Applause ]

00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:51.910
&gt;&gt;Sundar Pichai: So U.S. developers can bank
on these APIs being present in the browsers

00:09:51.910 --> 00:09:58.019
when users reach your applications.
Another important trend is mobile.

00:09:58.019 --> 00:10:00.690
All of you are carrying a smart phone here
today.

00:10:00.690 --> 00:10:06.480
The interesting thing there is, the smart
phones all are connected with capable browsers.
