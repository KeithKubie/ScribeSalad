00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:06.859
Documentaries come in all shapes and sizes
– from the political urgency of Michael

00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:10.830
Moore’s Fahrenheit 911,
to Werner Herzog’s meditative Cave of Forgotten

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:11.830
Dreams.

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:15.820
Some are funny, like Errol Morris’ 1997
film Fast, Cheap, and Out of Control.

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:20.429
And others are earnest and striking, like
13th, Ava DuVernay’s examination of mass

00:00:20.429 --> 00:00:21.429
incarceration.

00:00:21.429 --> 00:00:24.910
The best ones use many of the same cinematic
and storytelling techniques as fiction films

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:29.050
to explore their characters and themes, and
take audiences on an emotional journey.

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:32.930
And Otto Bell’s 2015 film The Eagle Huntress
fits that bill.

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:37.670
It tells a nonfiction story using traditional
cinematic techniques and ultra-modern equipment,

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.720
all without sacrificing the heart of the tale.

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:52.560
[Intro Music Plays]

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:54.640
Director Otto Bell found his inspiration in

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:57.700
a few still images published by the BBC in
2014.

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:02.120
They showed a young Kazakh girl in traditional
dress with an enormous eagle hoisted on her

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:03.699
arm, or launching into flight.

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:07.659
Within a year, Bell had packed some gear,
enlisted a few crew members, and traveled

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:11.950
to one of the most remote locations in the
world: deep in the heart of Mongolia.

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:16.200
And what he found there was an extraordinary
character and an underdog story.

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.590
Now, during Crash Course Film History and
Production, we talked a lot about film as

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.470
an illusion of reality.

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:25.680
Filmmakers use the tools of cinema – things
like shots, cuts, sound, and narrative structure

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.390
– to trick us into believing what we’re
seeing.

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:33.330
The whole point is to make an audience feel
something, whether it’s fear, joy, or heartbreak.

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:37.070
A director wants us to experience the story
with the characters.

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:38.750
Documentaries are no different.

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:40.469
They’re illusions of reality too.

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:43.969
I mean, sure, the characters they depict are
by and large real people.

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:45.500
And the stories actually happened.

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.810
But documentaries use the same basic techniques
as fiction films.

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.690
And the best ones use those cinematic tricks
in good faith.

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:56.000
They might collapse time or choose out-of-sequence
reaction shots, but only in ways that remain

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.880
true to the spirit, theme, or subject of the
story.

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.020
In The Eagle Huntress, those film techniques
are beautifully harnessed to tell the story

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:09.009
of Aisholpan Nurgaiv, a 13-year-old Kazakh
girl living in Mongolia who dreams of becoming

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:10.009
an eagle huntress.

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:14.430
Eagle hunters have both a practical and cultural
significance to Aisholpan’s nomadic people.

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.470
Eagles are used to hunt game for fur and meat.

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:20.500
But they’re also used to compete in festivals
and competitions, where eagle hunters test

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.000
their horseback, hunting, and eagle-calling
skills.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.760
The film opens with sweeping aerial shots
of the mountains and plains of Mongolia.

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.090
These could just as easily be the opening
shots of a Lord of the Rings movie, they’re

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:32.090
so epic.

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:35.670
And in the first scene, we see an older man
riding a horse to a far-off mountaintop.

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:40.400
He’s there to release his eagle back into
the wild after seven years as his hunting

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:41.810
companion, as per tradition.

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:45.980
We sense this man’s deep connection to the
bird, as he offers it a final meal and then

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:48.150
rides off, never to see it again.

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:52.080
From there, we meet our protagonist, Aisholpan,
who lives with her parents and siblings in

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:53.269
a yurt-like tent.

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:57.379
We learn that she’s always idolized her
father and grandfather, who are both prize-winning

00:02:57.379 --> 00:02:58.379
eagle hunters.

00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:00.970
She wants to follow in their eagle hunting footsteps.

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:03.020
Something relatively few women are doing.

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:04.879
And just like that, we’re on her side.

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:08.629
The film has given us a compelling protagonist
with a clear goal and obstacles.

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:11.920
We’re pulling for her, and her father is
pulling for her, too.

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:15.430
As he trains her in the techniques of eagle
hunting, he tells us, “I don’t want to

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:16.430
let her down.”

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:20.480
The film then introduces us to a group of
older, conservative, male eagle hunters.

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:23.590
None of them believe a girl should be allowed
to learn how to eagle hunt.

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:25.140
It’s a man’s job.

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:26.890
But they’ve never met Aisholpan!

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:30.950
She’s tenacious, hard-working, and – we’re
told – naturally gifted.

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:35.159
She’s also a 13-year-old girl, who takes
care of her brother and sister at her boarding

00:03:35.159 --> 00:03:37.430
school, paints her nails, and giggles with
her friends.

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:41.370
In one of the film’s most thrilling sequences,
we see Aisholpan and her father track an eagle

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:44.040
to its nest, high on a rocky cliff.

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:45.879
There they discover two eaglets.

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:49.700
Her father ties a rope around her waist,
and she clambers down the cliff face to capture

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:51.080
her very own eagle.

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:55.370
From there, the training ramps up, until it’s
time for Aisholpan to compete in her first

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:57.530
eagle festival, which takes place in Ölgii,
Mongolia.

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:02.989
She’s up against men three, four, or even
five times her age, with years of experience

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:04.510
and competition titles.

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:07.879
And still, in event after event, Aisholpan
holds her own.

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:12.360
Her eagle even sets a speed record, flying
from high atop a hill to her arm in less than

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:13.500
five seconds.

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:18.090
Spoiler alert: against all odds, she wins
first place in the festival, raising her trophy

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:20.590
overhead in triumph, surrounded by a cheering
crowd.

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:22.130
It’s a powerful moment.

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:25.080
But it’s not enough for the chorus of elder
eagle hunters.

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:29.470
They’re dismissive, and some even change
course and claim that her youth and gender

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:30.750
gave her an edge.

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:34.550
Lastly, the documentary follows Aisholpan and her father as they pack up and ride off into

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:36.750
the snowy wilderness, hunting for a fox.

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:39.440
They work together, father and daughter, for
days.

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:43.910
And after several missteps and some seriously
deep snow, Aisholpan and her eagle finally

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:46.480
spot, chase, and bring down a wild fox.

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:51.130
In the film’s final moments, her father straps
the fox to her saddle and they ride off for

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:55.480
home, not just as father and daughter, but
as a pair of true eagle hunters.

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:57.400
The Eagle Huntress is a simple movie.

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:58.400
And that’s part of its power.

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:02.910
The film distills its themes beautifully and
presents such a winning and offhandedly-heroic

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:04.720
protagonist, that it feels easy.

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:05.750
But... it wasn’t.

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:07.090
Like, at all.

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:11.550
We don’t judge the quality of a film based
on how hard it was to make, but director Otto

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:16.470
Bell and his skeleton crew deserve special
mention for capturing the images and sounds

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:18.220
that bring this story to life.

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:23.290
First, they traveled to a bitterly cold, remote
region of Mongolia, and relied on very modern

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:26.890
technology to tell this story about a longstanding
tradition.

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:30.600
Relatively lightweight digital cameras allowed
them to travel and work in these far-flung

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:31.600
locations.

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:35.600
Drones allowed the filmmakers to create tracking
shots, crane shots, and those glorious opening

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:39.590
aerials without the expense of dolly tracks,
helicopters, and actual cranes.

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:43.660
Mini Go-Pro cameras strapped to Aisholpan
gave us a first-hand view of her climb down

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:46.940
to the eagle’s nest and the first interaction
she has with her eagle.

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:50.880
Those same cameras, attached to the eagles
themselves, provided us a glimpse of their

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:53.100
point of view as they soared through the sky.

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:57.320
Second, they integrated themselves into the
lives of Aisholpan, her family, her friends,

00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:58.720
and the older eagle hunters.

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:01.350
Aisholpan was understandably shy at first.

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:05.220
It took time and patience to get her to open
up and speak conversationally in front of

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:06.220
the cameras.

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:10.270
And third, they did it all while trying to
remain respectful of her culture.

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:14.260
Documentaries aim to depict real people in
real situations, but they’re still illusions

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:15.540
of that reality.

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:18.890
So these films bear a different kind of ethical
burden than fiction films.

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:23.160
And no one in The Eagle Huntress comes off
mocked by the film or filmmakers – not even

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:25.200
the old men who look down on Aisholpan.

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:28.150
They’re presented as wrong-headed and misguided,
for sure.

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:31.040
But it’s also clear that they’re grappling
with a changing world.

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:35.040
This brings us to one way to look at this
kind of film: as an ethnographic study of

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:37.620
a longstanding culture within the modern age.

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:41.420
The roots of this documentary film tradition
trace all the way back to one of the first

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:45.360
feature documentary films,
Robert J. Flaherty’s Nanook of the North

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:46.920
made in 1922.

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:51.000
Nanook took audiences deep into the frigid
Canadian arctic to follow the struggles of

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.610
an Inuk man and his family.

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:57.200
That film, however, has been roundly criticized
for distorting or even fabricating events

00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:01.480
to make the Inuk culture seem more exotic
and out of step with the contemporary world.

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:05.590
In real life, the main character wasn’t
named Nanook, didn’t have a wife, and hunted

00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:08.170
with rifles, not spears as the film shows.

00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:12.380
By all accounts, The Eagle Huntress is a more
culturally respectful and honest film.

00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:16.710
Rather than exoticize Aisholpan, the filmmakers
seem more interested in presenting her real

00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:17.710
life.

00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:20.720
By doing that, it actually makes this remote
culture feel familiar.

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:24.630
While we do see her in traditional dress and
riding horseback, we see her wearing denim

00:07:24.630 --> 00:07:25.870
jeans and modern coats.

00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:28.890
Her family rides motorbikes and trucks, as
well as horses.

00:07:28.890 --> 00:07:32.610
And one shot even shows us a portable solar
panel that the family packs up with them when

00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:33.610
they travel.

00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:38.160
The juxtaposition of ancient tradition and
modern life is driven home when Aisholpan

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:41.740
and her father travel to Ölgii, the largest
town for a hundred miles.

00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:46.250
A series of shots follow them riding horses
across vast empty landscapes, eagles perched

00:07:46.250 --> 00:07:48.520
on their arms, dressed in traditional furs.

00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:52.470
Then we see them riding into town, along roads,
next to cars, and past stores.

00:07:52.470 --> 00:07:55.650
It’s as if they’ve ridden out of the past,
right into the present.

00:07:55.650 --> 00:07:59.750
Which, by some interpretation, is how Aisholpan
functions within her culture.

00:07:59.750 --> 00:08:04.200
She’s taking on the traditional practice
of eagle hunting, and doing it as a contemporary

00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:05.200
woman.

00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:09.310
Now, The Eagle Huntress has been criticized
for distorting Kazakh and Mongolian culture,

00:08:09.310 --> 00:08:11.420
so it’s not a perfect ethnographic study.

00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:15.330
Stanford historian Adrienne Mayor suggests
that this documentary may have focused too

00:08:15.330 --> 00:08:19.120
much on making Aisholpan’s story seem unique
and filled with adversity.

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:22.410
Mayor points out that there were many female
eagle hunters throughout history, and that

00:08:22.410 --> 00:08:24.240
there are several active ones today.

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:27.970
Women like Makpal Abdrazakova, whose story
has been reported on since 2011.

00:08:27.970 --> 00:08:31.920
And even though the head-shaking elders add
to the drama and conflict of the film, Mayor

00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:35.530
and others say that Mongolia isn’t a misogynistic
culture.

00:08:35.530 --> 00:08:39.640
Even though Western audiences and filmmakers
might assume that of nomadic societies or

00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:40.640
other countries.

00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:44.130
Aisholpan’s parents’ constant support
of her and her passion for eagle hunting is

00:08:44.130 --> 00:08:47.930
genuine, but may not be as unusual as the
documentary implies.

00:08:47.930 --> 00:08:51.120
Other eagle hunters and people of Mongolian
communities have said that women were never

00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:52.570
discouraged from this tradition.

00:08:52.570 --> 00:08:56.620
And there’s evidence that women have consistently
had important roles and opportunities in these

00:08:56.620 --> 00:08:57.620
societies.

00:08:57.620 --> 00:09:00.590
So this could be a case where the director
had a story in mind because of what he filmed

00:09:00.590 --> 00:09:03.640
and his assumptions, rather than what he researched.

00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:06.310
And it led to a slightly askew portrait of
the truth.

00:09:06.310 --> 00:09:11.650
Still, The Eagle Huntress works as a traditional
hero’s journey, and an examination of an

00:09:11.650 --> 00:09:14.300
long-lived society in an increasingly modern
world.

00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:16.710
Sometimes the simplest stories pack the biggest
punch.

00:09:16.710 --> 00:09:21.110
It’s a beautifully made documentary about
a young girl who embraces her culture, works

00:09:21.110 --> 00:09:25.630
to master an old art, overcomes her obstacles,
and – through hard work and fearlessness
