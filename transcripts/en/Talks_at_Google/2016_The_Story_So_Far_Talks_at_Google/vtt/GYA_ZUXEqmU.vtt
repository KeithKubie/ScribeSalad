JULIET EHIMUAN-CHIAZOR:
I'm Juliet Ehimuan-Chiazor.

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.720
And I feel very
honored and really

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:17.985
delighted to be moderating
this panel of these very

00:00:17.985 --> 00:00:20.096
inspiring women.

00:00:20.096 --> 00:00:26.014
I'm going to start by
introducing them very briefly.

00:00:26.014 --> 00:00:27.810
You are very familiar
with who they are.

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.300
So I'll start to
my immediate left.

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.330
This is Ibukun Awosika.

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:36.250
She's the first female
Chairman, Board of Directors,

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:38.116
First Bank of Nigeria Limited.

00:00:38.116 --> 00:00:40.960
She's also the founder and CEO.

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:43.460
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:45.870
We're very proud.

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.460
She's also the founder and
CEO of the Chair Centre Group.

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.560
She's a multiple-award-winning
entrepreneur,

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:56.310

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:00.440
Award.

00:01:05.459 --> 00:01:08.420
She currently sits
on many boards

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.540
and is a co-founder
and past chairperson

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:15.621
of Women In Business Management
and Public Service, Wimbiz.

00:01:15.621 --> 00:01:18.270
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.490
Ibukun, thank you so much
for joining us today.

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:21.990
It

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:22.860
IBUKUN AWOSIKA:
You're most welcome.

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.860
JULIET EHIMUAN CHIAZOR:
We really appreciate it.

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:26.610
And we have TY Bello.

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.060
She is a multifaceted
woman with a few labels--

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:35.380
singer, songwriter,
photographer,

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:37.073
and philanthropist.

00:01:37.073 --> 00:01:38.997
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:42.430
Prior to pursuing
a solo career, she

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:46.580
was a member of the
defunct gospel band, Kush.

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:48.910
She's also a member of
the Nigerian photography

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:53.270
collective, Depth of Field, and
was the official photographer

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:56.150
of the former
President of Nigeria.

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:59.250
She's best known for her
award-winning singles,

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:04.410
"Greenland," "Ekundayo", "This
Man," "Freedom," "Funmise,"

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:10.910
and "The Morning Songbook."

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:12.960
She stages annual
photography exhibition

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:16.240
to raise funds for orphans
across the country.

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:20.700
She's also a director of Link
a Child, an NGO dedicated

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:25.080
to propagating information
on orphanages in Nigeria,

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.180
and soliciting sponsorship
on their behalf.

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:28.090
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:29.690
It's good to have you here, TY.

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:30.822
TY BELLO: Thank you.

00:02:30.822 --> 00:02:33.030
JULIET EHIMUAN-CHIAZOR: So
to start the conversation,

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:34.630
this will be in two parts.

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:36.500
We're kicking off
with this panel.

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.580
And we'll have a second session
after the break with Dr. Oby

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:41.810
Ezekwesili.

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:45.320
So to start off, I'm going to
ask a relatively broad question

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:49.160
for each member of the panel,
starting with Mrs. Awosika.

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:53.410
So when we think about where
we are in our society today,

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:55.920
we're talking about
smashing the glass ceiling.

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.400
Is there still a glass ceiling?

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.120
We have made some progress.

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.840
In you opinion, is there
still a glass ceiling?

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.700
And what has been
your experience

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:08.360
around taking decisions to
help you smash or overcome

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:11.015
the glass ceiling?

00:03:11.015 --> 00:03:15.265
IBUKUN AWOSIKA: OK, this glass
ceiling that won't go away.

00:03:15.265 --> 00:03:18.660
I actually think that the
issue of the glass ceiling

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:22.370
is different for every
woman, and is also different

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:27.250
depending on where you are in
your career or your business

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:28.580
life.

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:31.160
It's different in
Nigeria, putting it

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.740
in context is
different depending

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:36.360
on what part of the country
you come from as well.

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.670
Because there are
different levels

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:43.850
that women are at, in terms
of having opportunities,

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:46.430
depending on what part of
the country you come from.

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:50.390
But I think that collectively,
when we look at it,

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:52.730
no matter what part of
the country you come from,

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:55.520
we have moved quite
a distance in terms

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:58.560
of the kind of opportunities
that women have.

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:05.430
But that's also a
function of social class.

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:06.940
Because that's another thing.

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:11.000
The average middle-class
to upper-class family

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.910
doesn't segregate between who
goes to school, whether it's

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:15.960
the male or the female child.

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:21.440
And the south, especially the
southwestern part of Nigeria,

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:25.320
would have every child from
middle class to upper class,

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:27.850
averagely have a
university education

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:32.270
and at least attempt to build
a career, one way or the other.

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:34.020
Now, there are other
factors that are then

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:36.020
beginning to come to play.

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:38.810
Because I think at
the starting point,

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:41.713
male and female start off
basically, equal footing.

00:04:41.713 --> 00:04:42.400
JULIET EHIMUAN-CHIAZOR:
Little things, [INAUDIBLE].

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:43.240
IBUKUN AWOSIKA: Yes.

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:46.510
But along the
path, other factors

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:51.210
that are not even as traditional
as we think begin to show up.

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:55.140
So now you've married a guy
who has his own insecurities.

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:57.180
And because of his
insecurities, he

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:00.180
would like a woman that he
can keep at home and control.

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:02.300
So that's not a societal factor.

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:04.520
That's an individual issue.

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:10.220
Or you've married a man who
just doesn't-- in his mind,

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:13.380
his mother was-- well,
is-- a housewife.

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:15.460
And he grew up with his
mother always been there.

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:18.350
And what he wants is a
wife who is a housewife.

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:23.690
I think the real issue is about
what the women want to do,

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:27.360
in terms of whatever kind
of ceiling is still there.

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:30.580
It's an individual
choice for every woman

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:33.120
to choose what life
you want to live.

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:34.620
And that comes into play.

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:37.490
We can play back
to our girl child,

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:40.550
and start to teach
the girls about having

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:44.500
the ability to make that
choice for themselves.

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:47.190
And that should
start from deciding

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:50.220
how far they want to go, by
having a sense of who they are.

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:52.880
And at a stage,
deciding who they

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:56.660
want to marry based on
who they want to be.

00:05:56.660 --> 00:06:00.890
And choosing the spouse is a
key success factor in my books.

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:02.530
So if you have a
sense of who you

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:05.200
are, you have a sense of
how far you want to go,

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:08.150
when a nice-looking rich
and handsome guy who

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:10.690
wants a housewife comes
calling, you don't even listen.

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:12.765
Because he doesn't fit
where you want to go.

00:06:12.765 --> 00:06:14.890
So it's not a matter of
that he wants to marry you.

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:17.610
It is a matter of do
you want to marry him?

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:20.200
Does he fit into the
life you want to live?

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:22.940
Does he fit into the future
you see for yourself?

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:26.250
Now, so as we take some
of the fundamental issues

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:29.082
and we move forward, we
then get into the workplace.

00:06:29.082 --> 00:06:30.540
You get into the
workplace and then

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:34.790
you talk about does the woman
understand that she can't play

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:37.320
the feminine card anymore,
if she really wants

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:39.180
her respect in the workplace.

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:43.150
Does she know all that she's
got to earn a place by making

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:46.590
sure she's competent, she's
capable, she's equipped,

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:48.190
and she's ready to play.

00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:50.170
Does she understand
she must have courage.

00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:51.390
She must be focused.

00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:53.480
She must able to
challenge status quo,

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:55.850
and fight for herself as well.

00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:58.770
Does she know she
mustn't defer to the male

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:00.150
just because he's male.

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:02.644
As long as they're pairs, and
they have equal opportunity,

00:07:02.644 --> 00:07:04.060
she should fight
for the position.

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:07.430
So there are many things
that come into play.

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:09.620
Because at the end
of the day, one thing

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:13.320
I can say in my
experience, is that when

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:15.860
you're good at what
you do, there's

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:18.540
a stage where you
can't be ignored,

00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:20.090
whether you're male or female.

00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:20.700
JULIET EHIMUAN-CHIAZOR:
That's true.

00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:22.300
IBUKUN AWOSIKA: There
is a point where

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:26.650
the competition falls apart,
the gender card falls apart.

00:07:26.650 --> 00:07:28.470
Because at the end
of the day, what

00:07:28.470 --> 00:07:30.430
is the interest
of the shareholder

00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:31.820
or the stakeholders?

00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:34.530
They want to succeed at
whatever they want to do.

00:07:34.530 --> 00:07:39.652
And when you're
facing the bare facts,

00:07:39.652 --> 00:07:41.610
you're looking for the
best person for the job.

00:07:41.610 --> 00:07:44.060
Now, there's all the issue
of OK, boys club, girls club.

00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:45.000
OK, so?

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:46.500
Boys can network.

00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:48.270
Girls can network too.

00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:51.920
I actually think girls can
be more powerful networkers.

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:53.140
Why?

00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:55.960
You can use the
network of your spouse.

00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:57.880
And you can use
your own network.

00:07:57.880 --> 00:07:59.530
And when you use
your network, you

00:07:59.530 --> 00:08:02.470
use the network of your
friends and their spouses.

00:08:02.470 --> 00:08:07.430
So you can play from both sides
even more than the guy can.

00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:11.780
But your strongest weapon
is really about showing up.

00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:16.010
Because the one thing nobody
can ignore is when you show up.

00:08:16.010 --> 00:08:19.460
When you show up at your
table, and your capacity,

00:08:19.460 --> 00:08:21.780
your capability,
your competence,

00:08:21.780 --> 00:08:27.650
your ability is so open
for everybody to see.

00:08:27.650 --> 00:08:28.760
You can't be ignored.

00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:31.250
And that narrows the table.

00:08:31.250 --> 00:08:33.720
And there's a point
where again, where I know

00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:36.250
there's still a mindset issue
that we're dealing with.

00:08:36.250 --> 00:08:39.210
But like I said, the
factors vary depending

00:08:39.210 --> 00:08:40.350
on different circumstances.

00:08:40.350 --> 00:08:42.429
But first, let's deal with us.

00:08:42.429 --> 00:08:45.114
So I think when the girls
have said, OK, you know what?

00:08:45.114 --> 00:08:46.530
We're ready to go
the [INAUDIBLE].

00:08:46.530 --> 00:08:47.983
We're not making excuses,
saying oh, sorry.

00:08:47.983 --> 00:08:48.482
I'm a girl.

00:08:48.482 --> 00:08:49.770
OK, so I have children.

00:08:49.770 --> 00:08:51.032
So I have a husband.

00:08:51.032 --> 00:08:52.490
We work out how to
deal with those.

00:08:52.490 --> 00:08:54.590
And I think a lot of girls
can deal with that now.

00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:55.590
We find these solutions.

00:08:55.590 --> 00:08:56.730
We're not simple women.

00:08:56.730 --> 00:08:57.690
So we receive help.

00:08:57.690 --> 00:08:58.554
We create help.

00:08:58.554 --> 00:09:00.720
So that as a cook to cook,
what's my responsibility?

00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:02.800
There must be food on
the table for my family.

00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:04.281
Who cares who cooks the food?

00:09:04.281 --> 00:09:05.530
As long as there's food there.

00:09:05.530 --> 00:09:07.850
So my children must
be taken care of.

00:09:07.850 --> 00:09:10.520
If I cannot afford to take 20
people to take care of them,

00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:12.060
then I make it work.

00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:14.230
Then somebody must
do my shopping.

00:09:14.230 --> 00:09:15.320
You don't have to know.

00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:18.600
I can call [INAUDIBLE],
and get everything

00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:21.550
delivered into my kitchen.

00:09:21.550 --> 00:09:26.690
There's a lot more ways
to get things done now.

00:09:26.690 --> 00:09:29.700
So that the typical
traditional limitations

00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:32.020
that women have can be removed.

00:09:32.020 --> 00:09:34.170
And technology makes it easy.

00:09:34.170 --> 00:09:36.210
Because then in the
middle of a meeting,

00:09:36.210 --> 00:09:39.090
I can still check on my son
in university in England.

00:09:39.090 --> 00:09:40.110
Just what's up?

00:09:40.110 --> 00:09:42.000
Send him a message or response.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:42.550
I'm going on.

00:09:42.550 --> 00:09:43.850
I've checked in for the day.

00:09:43.850 --> 00:09:45.660
And I'm still
sitting at a meeting.

00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:48.109
So I think we can change.

00:09:48.109 --> 00:09:49.400
We can definitely move forward.

00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:50.356
JULIET EHIMUAN-CHIAZOR: Great.

00:09:50.356 --> 00:09:51.481
OBY EZEKWESILI : Thank you.

00:09:51.481 --> 00:09:52.746
[APPLAUSE]

00:09:53.022 --> 00:09:55.480
JULIET EHIMUAN-CHIAZOR: You're
raised some really important

00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:55.980
points.

00:09:55.980 --> 00:09:58.150
And I would like to
stay on those for a bit.

00:09:58.150 --> 00:10:00.050
You talked about some factors.

00:10:00.050 --> 00:10:02.380
For example, choice
of spouse, right?

00:10:02.380 --> 00:10:06.377
And a lot of women actually do
value having a balanced home

00:10:06.377 --> 00:10:07.210
and a peaceful home.

00:10:07.210 --> 00:10:08.380
And that's very important.

00:10:08.380 --> 00:10:12.180
And TY, very recently, you've
been very much in the press,

00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:14.030
being instrumental
in transforming

00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:17.770
the life of a bread
seller, to become a model.

00:10:17.770 --> 00:10:18.330
TY BELLO: OK.

00:10:18.330 --> 00:10:20.870
I'm glad we're talking
about this glass, the glass

00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:25.680
ceiling and women making it
forward and pushing forward

00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:27.040
in society.

00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:30.780
My take on it is you
don't necessarily

00:10:30.780 --> 00:10:34.345
have to be antagonistic
to break it.

00:10:34.345 --> 00:10:36.080
It can be done with wisdom.

00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:38.090
And it's all about maneuvering.

00:10:38.090 --> 00:10:42.260
I would rather carry
a man along, than

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:44.401
drag him over kicking
and screaming, or going

00:10:44.401 --> 00:10:45.520
at it alone.

00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:48.550
I think psychologically,
it's better for most women

00:10:48.550 --> 00:10:52.550
when they have the corporation
of whoever they're with.

00:10:52.550 --> 00:10:55.250
Now, she said something
very important.

00:10:55.250 --> 00:10:57.510
And that is a point
where most people are not

00:10:57.510 --> 00:11:00.980
being mentored or taught enough,
is making that initial choice,

00:11:00.980 --> 00:11:04.500
to find out who you should
be with in the first place.

00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:07.030
For instance, I knew I
wanted to be an artist.

00:11:07.030 --> 00:11:09.991
And I had an
ex-boyfriend who said,

00:11:09.991 --> 00:11:11.490
I don't mind this
photography thing.

00:11:11.490 --> 00:11:15.750
But I don't kind of see my
wife carrying cameras around.

00:11:15.750 --> 00:11:16.820
And I took it seriously.

00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:19.730
I did not think it was
just something on the side.

00:11:19.730 --> 00:11:22.710
I wasn't going to marry him and
hope that he would support me

00:11:22.710 --> 00:11:23.730
afterwards.

00:11:23.730 --> 00:11:27.060
So I knew, for instance,
that for this lady,

00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:30.480
the only way we could go far
was if we had cooperation.

00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:34.730
Because you have to
realize that culture

00:11:34.730 --> 00:11:42.100
is a very, very big part
of the whole scenario here.

00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:44.010
And you can't do away with it.

00:11:44.010 --> 00:11:46.140
You can't fight it, necessarily.

00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:47.360
You can fight.

00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:51.212
You can change, but with
wisdom, I think, yeah.

00:11:51.212 --> 00:11:52.920
JULIET EHIMUAN-CHIAZOR:
Great, thank you.

00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:56.550
Ibukun, what's
your take on that?

00:11:56.550 --> 00:11:58.380
IBUKUN AWOSIKA:
Well, to be honest,

00:11:58.380 --> 00:12:03.260
I think half the battle
that women fight, here.

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:07.690
It's because we tend
to live out of context.

00:12:07.690 --> 00:12:10.050
You know, we're
all well-educated

00:12:10.050 --> 00:12:12.820
and quite exposed.

00:12:12.820 --> 00:12:14.530
We've been everywhere.

00:12:14.530 --> 00:12:16.710
And we've read [INAUDIBLE].

00:12:16.710 --> 00:12:19.180
We've watched a lot of movies.

00:12:19.180 --> 00:12:21.880
And a lot of girls
then get up and really

00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:26.130
just want to declare
that kind of liberty

00:12:26.130 --> 00:12:28.300
that they think a
Western woman has.

00:12:28.300 --> 00:12:33.110
The reality is, it's
an approach that is

00:12:33.110 --> 00:12:34.710
bound to fail from the onset.

00:12:34.710 --> 00:12:36.590
I always talk about strategy.

00:12:36.590 --> 00:12:39.420
There's no business
without a strategic plan.

00:12:39.420 --> 00:12:41.674
And we're all comfortable
to have a strategic plan

00:12:41.674 --> 00:12:43.590
for the next three years
of our business, five

00:12:43.590 --> 00:12:44.900
years of our business.

00:12:44.900 --> 00:12:47.740
Why don't we have a
strategic plan for our life?

00:12:47.740 --> 00:12:50.630
That's affects where
we really want to go.

00:12:50.630 --> 00:12:53.310
And when you're just got
a up a strategic plan

00:12:53.310 --> 00:12:56.330
for your business, you
don't leave the context

00:12:56.330 --> 00:12:58.150
of your environment out of it.

00:12:58.150 --> 00:13:00.240
You take all the
factors around you

00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:03.960
into consideration, in making
the decisions of how you walk

00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:05.980
around it to achieve success.

00:13:05.980 --> 00:13:08.630
That's really how we,
as an African woman,

00:13:08.630 --> 00:13:11.520
and specifically as a
Nigerian, needs to look at it.

00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:17.625
Reality is culture is on a
transformational journey.

00:13:17.625 --> 00:13:18.500
TY BELLO: Yes, it is.

00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:21.010
IBUKUN AWOSIKA: Society
doesn't change overnight.

00:13:21.010 --> 00:13:23.571
And even if it
does, I don't know,

00:13:23.571 --> 00:13:25.820
it would probably take a
million years for many things

00:13:25.820 --> 00:13:27.490
in Nigeria to be totally done.

00:13:27.490 --> 00:13:29.440
As you can see, our
parents go to school

00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:31.610
abroad, get to
the highest level.

00:13:31.610 --> 00:13:33.140
And just as they
retire, they decide

00:13:33.140 --> 00:13:34.890
they want to go and
live in their village.

00:13:34.890 --> 00:13:36.440
And you really can't
understand how.

00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:39.340
The guy's left his village
since he was God knows what.

00:13:39.340 --> 00:13:43.630
But it shows you that is quite
deep, this cultural thing.

00:13:43.630 --> 00:13:48.430
Now, what that should say to us
as women is this is my context.

00:13:48.430 --> 00:13:49.840
This is my environment.

00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:53.390
There's certain values that are
important in my environment.

00:13:53.390 --> 00:13:54.680
I want to play to win.

00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:55.740
That's my goal.

00:13:55.740 --> 00:13:59.280
How do I play to win
in my environment?

00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:02.616
What does it cost me to
seek my husband's permission

00:14:02.616 --> 00:14:03.740
for something I want to do?

00:14:03.740 --> 00:14:05.550
Not because I don't
know what I want to do.

00:14:05.550 --> 00:14:10.270
But is wisdom because I'd
rather run with his backing.

00:14:10.270 --> 00:14:12.740
And if I fail, I
have someone who's

00:14:12.740 --> 00:14:17.090
shoulder I can lean on, not
someone to say, I told you so.

00:14:17.090 --> 00:14:17.840
You know?

00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:19.120
I'll give you an example.

00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:22.130
A young woman got transferred.

00:14:22.130 --> 00:14:23.890
She works for a multinational.

00:14:23.890 --> 00:14:30.800
And she always knew that she
will be up for her career

00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:33.090
to go really far in
that multinational,

00:14:33.090 --> 00:14:36.600
she'll be up for international
posting at any point in time.

00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:40.040
Now, if I'm in that kind of
setting, and then you marry,

00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:41.650
you're married.

00:14:41.650 --> 00:14:43.730
And you can see the
opportunity come in.

00:14:43.730 --> 00:14:45.530
And you'll be in
position for it.

00:14:45.530 --> 00:14:47.010
First and foremost,
because I know

00:14:47.010 --> 00:14:51.662
my job can have that context,
I will prepare my husband one

00:14:51.662 --> 00:14:52.370
way or the other.

00:14:52.370 --> 00:14:54.930
It will be a conversation that
we would have had that one.

00:14:54.930 --> 00:14:57.636
Even if you're pretending
sometimes, like he,

00:14:57.636 --> 00:15:00.780
you know they could just
transfer me to Mexico tomorrow.

00:15:00.780 --> 00:15:02.510
How am I going to go to Mexico?

00:15:02.510 --> 00:15:04.500
You, the children,
and all of that?

00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:06.477
You're instigating
a conversation.

00:15:06.477 --> 00:15:07.810
But you're preparing the ground.

00:15:07.810 --> 00:15:09.580
So you would hear his opinion.

00:15:09.580 --> 00:15:11.400
And listening to
him will help you

00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:14.500
to know how to
formulate the strategy

00:15:14.500 --> 00:15:17.790
to work the environment
of the home, in case

00:15:17.790 --> 00:15:19.360
that situation arises.

00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:22.012
So that his mind is
already conditioned.

00:15:22.012 --> 00:15:23.970
And he may end up thinking
he is the one that's

00:15:23.970 --> 00:15:25.980
convinced you to take the
posting because he thinks

00:15:25.980 --> 00:15:26.896
he's good for the job.

00:15:26.896 --> 00:15:28.960
But you already know you
want to go to Mexico.

00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:30.430
So it's not how.

00:15:30.430 --> 00:15:32.950
So I'm saying, he
gets the respect.

00:15:32.950 --> 00:15:33.900
It gets the honor.

00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:37.310
A man has a natural big ego.

00:15:37.310 --> 00:15:38.940
What are you going
to do about that?

00:15:38.940 --> 00:15:41.530
The bottom line is, how
do you manage his ego,

00:15:41.530 --> 00:15:44.350
manage his respect,
and hist authority

00:15:44.350 --> 00:15:46.320
as the head of
the house in a way

00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:47.932
that you still
achieve your goal?

00:15:47.932 --> 00:15:49.890
JULIET EHIMUAN-CHIAZOR:
So from the perspective

00:15:49.890 --> 00:15:54.480
of entrepreneurship, you have
been quite the entrepreneur.

00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:57.060
And I know you talk
about really focusing

00:15:57.060 --> 00:16:00.190
on ethics and integrity, in
building the Chair Centre

00:16:00.190 --> 00:16:00.870
Group.

00:16:00.870 --> 00:16:02.654
And you had some
challenging situations,

00:16:02.654 --> 00:16:04.070
which you were
able to turn around

00:16:04.070 --> 00:16:06.150
for the good of the
business in the long run.

00:16:06.150 --> 00:16:09.440
What advice do you have
for entrepreneurs going

00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:12.670
through challenges, from the
perspective of navigating

00:16:12.670 --> 00:16:16.046
through standing for
what you believe in,

00:16:16.046 --> 00:16:18.170
holding your ground, and
actually being successful?

00:16:20.430 --> 00:16:22.180
IBUKUN AWOSIKA: I think
the starting point

00:16:22.180 --> 00:16:25.270
is that you have to have a
conversation with yourself,

00:16:25.270 --> 00:16:28.440
at the very beginning,
and decide who you are

00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:30.260
or who you want to be.

00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:32.630
You must decide what your
value system will be.

00:16:32.630 --> 00:16:35.580
You can never wait
to get to a crossroad

00:16:35.580 --> 00:16:38.360
before you determine what
your value system is.

00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:41.150
The reality is, if you
try to decide your value

00:16:41.150 --> 00:16:43.940
system at a crossroad,
the pressure of the moment

00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:46.110
will force you in a
different direction.

00:16:46.110 --> 00:16:49.890
So what happened to me
was, as I was starting out

00:16:49.890 --> 00:16:53.700
as a young girl in my
20s, I became a Christian.

00:16:53.700 --> 00:16:55.820
Because I did start
off as a Muslim.

00:16:55.820 --> 00:16:57.735
I was brought up
in a Muslim home.

00:16:57.735 --> 00:16:58.610
I became a Christian.

00:16:58.610 --> 00:17:01.141
And then I read this book.

00:17:01.141 --> 00:17:05.619
It was written by some guy
about God owning his business.

00:17:05.619 --> 00:17:07.619
And I found it very fascinating.

00:17:07.619 --> 00:17:10.500
And I made a decision that I
wanted God to own my business.

00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:12.680
And God can't own a business
where the value system

00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:14.700
isn't based on the Bible.

00:17:14.700 --> 00:17:20.089
So I built my own value
system on biblical principles.

00:17:20.089 --> 00:17:22.240
And with that
conviction, I decided

00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:24.240
some things I will not do.

00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:26.296
The first, before I
became a Christian,

00:17:26.296 --> 00:17:27.920
I started my business
for about a year.

00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:29.700
But even at the beginning
of the business,

00:17:29.700 --> 00:17:31.560
without the biblical principles.

00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:33.785
Based on just my
upbringing, I decided

00:17:33.785 --> 00:17:34.910
two things I will never do.

00:17:34.910 --> 00:17:37.459
I was never going to sleep
with a man to get a job.

00:17:37.459 --> 00:17:39.000
And I was never
going to pay a bribe.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.625
Now, everybody assured me there
were a perfect formula to fail,

00:17:41.625 --> 00:17:44.480
especially the bribe
in Nigerian context.

00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:48.200
But you know, I think we
underestimate Nigerians.

00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:49.710
That's the one thing
I can tell you.

00:17:49.710 --> 00:17:53.160
Because if I built a business--
and this is our 28th year.

00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:55.620
And I say that we've
lived by those principles,

00:17:55.620 --> 00:17:57.350
then obviously there's
more than enough

00:17:57.350 --> 00:17:59.717
room in this environment to
build the kind of business

00:17:59.717 --> 00:18:00.300
that you want.

00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:01.950
It's all about you.

00:18:01.950 --> 00:18:05.660
And with those two
things said before me,

00:18:05.660 --> 00:18:06.700
I started the journey.

00:18:06.700 --> 00:18:08.924
Now, of course, there have
been many, many moments

00:18:08.924 --> 00:18:10.590
where those values
have been challenged.

00:18:10.590 --> 00:18:15.960
But I've been sometimes
really difficult and very

00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:18.550
sad moments have
taken the decision

00:18:18.550 --> 00:18:20.830
to stand by those
principles, paying

00:18:20.830 --> 00:18:23.090
a high price, many instances.

00:18:23.090 --> 00:18:25.000
But one thing I have
learned is this.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:27.300
If you want to build
something to last,

00:18:27.300 --> 00:18:29.260
you need to build
on the right values.

00:18:29.260 --> 00:18:32.030
If you build on compromise,
the same compromises

00:18:32.030 --> 00:18:33.020
will destroy you.

00:18:33.020 --> 00:18:35.472
I mean, imagine a girl
who is willing to sleep

00:18:35.472 --> 00:18:36.680
with men to get the contract.

00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:39.420
You're only attractive
before you're conquered.

00:18:39.420 --> 00:18:41.380
But reality is once
the man slept with you

00:18:41.380 --> 00:18:45.180
once, your value is depreciated
by 100%, 80%, or 90%.

00:18:45.180 --> 00:18:46.930
I mean, you can have
a repeat performance.

00:18:46.930 --> 00:18:49.400
But he's overcome the challenge.

00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:50.440
So there's no big deal.

00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:52.800
So he doesn't have to give
you the big contract anymore.

00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:55.370
he can give that to the next
new conquest that he wants.

00:18:55.370 --> 00:18:57.750
And you can get the peanut.

00:18:57.750 --> 00:19:00.280
If you pay a bribe,
yeah, there's

00:19:00.280 --> 00:19:03.370
always somebody who is
willing to pay more than you.

00:19:03.370 --> 00:19:06.260
And after a while,
it's a tough game.

00:19:06.260 --> 00:19:09.210
I then decided
what I would rather

00:19:09.210 --> 00:19:15.420
invest in is to invest time to
build service and build quality

00:19:15.420 --> 00:19:19.530
product, and make my company
indispensable to any customer

00:19:19.530 --> 00:19:21.810
that engages with us over time.

00:19:21.810 --> 00:19:24.919
And yes, you might be slower
than your peers at this stage,

00:19:24.919 --> 00:19:27.210
because there are some things
you're not willing to do.

00:19:27.210 --> 00:19:30.010
But I've found in my
business that you're

00:19:30.010 --> 00:19:32.900
far more sustainable over time.

00:19:32.900 --> 00:19:35.580
And you know, at
crucial moments,

00:19:35.580 --> 00:19:38.300
those principals were tested.

00:19:38.300 --> 00:19:41.320
Because like in 2004,
when the government said,

00:19:41.320 --> 00:19:43.720
OK ban on everything
related to furniture,

00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:46.170
it was a function of OK,
a bill that was-- I'd

00:19:46.170 --> 00:19:48.260
been in business
for 15 years then.

00:19:48.260 --> 00:19:49.870
Was I now going to
become a smuggler?

00:19:49.870 --> 00:19:51.560
I wasn't going to.

00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:54.400
Because my principal
value system

00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:57.180
I determined in advance was
not going to support that.

00:19:57.180 --> 00:20:00.830
So the only option I had was
to do backward integration

00:20:00.830 --> 00:20:02.630
and invest in
factories to support.

00:20:02.630 --> 00:20:04.350
What we were doing
was producing.

00:20:04.350 --> 00:20:06.440
We started local
production originally.

00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:08.200
And then all the
factors in Nigeria

00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:10.750
didn't allow us to fulfill
the dream I wanted.

00:20:10.750 --> 00:20:13.670
So we started producing in OEM
factories around the world,

00:20:13.670 --> 00:20:15.920
and bringing the
components back and adding

00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:17.190
to create our own line.

00:20:17.190 --> 00:20:21.096
So when the game changed,
all we did was OK, so what

00:20:21.096 --> 00:20:22.220
are we allowed to bring in?

00:20:22.220 --> 00:20:24.060
What are we not
allowed to bring in?

00:20:24.060 --> 00:20:27.140
And we started working
back, and started having

00:20:27.140 --> 00:20:29.080
JVs to produce in Nigeria.

00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:32.650
Ultimately, staying
by our principals

00:20:32.650 --> 00:20:35.820
encouraged us to build the
necessary factories here.

00:20:35.820 --> 00:20:38.220
Now, I'll now tell
you the real offshoot.

00:20:38.220 --> 00:20:40.780
When people talk about
oh, I sit on this board,

00:20:40.780 --> 00:20:42.370
I sit on that board,
I do that now.

00:20:42.370 --> 00:20:45.400
Frankly speaking,
the things that

00:20:45.400 --> 00:20:49.940
actually made me
attractive to be invited

00:20:49.940 --> 00:20:52.410
to sit on a number of boards
were those same things

00:20:52.410 --> 00:20:54.730
that I went through
in those tough times.

00:20:54.730 --> 00:20:58.065
It was the lessons I learned by
staying true to my principles.

00:20:58.065 --> 00:20:59.860
It was the sacrifices I made.

00:20:59.860 --> 00:21:03.400
Because I remember
when I was going

00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:05.270
to join the board of Cadbury.

00:21:05.270 --> 00:21:07.670
It was right after
Cadbury's crisis.

00:21:07.670 --> 00:21:11.100
And I got a call the day
before from a friend of mine

00:21:11.100 --> 00:21:13.517
that said, some people would
like to come and talk to you.

00:21:13.517 --> 00:21:15.266
And I said, well, I'm
travelling tomorrow.

00:21:15.266 --> 00:21:17.570
If they can see me tomorrow
morning, that will be fine.

00:21:17.570 --> 00:21:20.240
And two British gentleman
came to my house.

00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:25.900
We had conversation for 2 and
1/2 hours, and all of that.

00:21:25.900 --> 00:21:30.660
Cadbury was basically trying
to set up a board of integrity.

00:21:30.660 --> 00:21:33.700
And refusing to do
those things over time

00:21:33.700 --> 00:21:35.730
was how I got on their list.

00:21:35.730 --> 00:21:37.360
You never know who is watching.

00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:38.120
You don't know who is watching.

00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:39.860
Everybody is watching
what you're doing.

00:21:39.860 --> 00:21:43.029
People might hail you, even when
you're doing the wrong thing.

00:21:43.029 --> 00:21:44.570
You sound successful
and all of that.

00:21:44.570 --> 00:21:46.927
But when the chips are
down, you know somebody

00:21:46.927 --> 00:21:48.010
is going to say something.

00:21:48.010 --> 00:21:49.010
Because somebody is watching.

00:21:49.010 --> 00:21:50.420
And that's exactly
what happened.

00:21:50.420 --> 00:21:52.180
They had a
[INAUDIBLE] list of 30

00:21:52.180 --> 00:21:54.950
that was whittled down to 8,
that was whittled down to 6.

00:21:54.950 --> 00:21:56.980
And then they ended
up with a list

00:21:56.980 --> 00:21:59.210
of three-- myself, Atedo
Peterside, and [INAUDIBLE],

00:21:59.210 --> 00:22:00.084
who joined the board.

00:22:00.084 --> 00:22:03.600
And I've been on the board
of Cadbury since 2009.

00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:06.530
The day I was invited to
have a chat with the group

00:22:06.530 --> 00:22:10.960
chair of FBN Holding, he was
the Chair of the [INAUDIBLE]

00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:13.200
Bank, PLC then.

00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:16.390
It was simply for me to be
recruited to be Chairman

00:22:16.390 --> 00:22:17.620
of the insurance company.

00:22:17.620 --> 00:22:20.490
Because they were having
a startup company.

00:22:20.490 --> 00:22:24.176
That is a joint venture with
Sanlam, of South Africa.

00:22:24.176 --> 00:22:25.550
And they were
looking for someone

00:22:25.550 --> 00:22:28.330
who had good experience
in driving a startup

00:22:28.330 --> 00:22:29.820
with international partnership.

00:22:29.820 --> 00:22:32.080
Now, it was the
challenge of 2004

00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:34.650
that led me to a joint
venture partnership

00:22:34.650 --> 00:22:37.040
with the largest French
manufacturer of [INAUDIBLE].

00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:38.550
So I had that experience.

00:22:38.550 --> 00:22:41.800
I had stock to my values
through the trial period.

00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:44.370
And though every knowledge
I gained within that period

00:22:44.370 --> 00:22:46.540
was what they needed for
what they wanted to do.

00:22:46.540 --> 00:22:48.070
And that's how I was invited.

00:22:48.070 --> 00:22:50.419
I actually had the conversation
about being the chair

00:22:50.419 --> 00:22:51.460
of the insurance company.

00:22:51.460 --> 00:22:54.730
But I didn't know that to even
be the chair of the insurance

00:22:54.730 --> 00:22:57.170
company, I had to get on
the board of the bank.

00:22:57.170 --> 00:23:00.139
So a month after, I just
got a message that said,

00:23:00.139 --> 00:23:02.180
you've been appointed to
the board of First Bank.

00:23:02.180 --> 00:23:03.850
I'm, like, board of First Bank?

00:23:03.850 --> 00:23:04.650
How?

00:23:04.650 --> 00:23:07.510
I was asked about joining
the insurance company.

00:23:07.510 --> 00:23:11.000
So things you do for
the right reasons,

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:13.330
ultimately, people are watching.

00:23:13.330 --> 00:23:15.070
Somebody will notice.

00:23:15.070 --> 00:23:16.680
And it would create value.

00:23:16.680 --> 00:23:20.070
So doing the right thing has
its own reward over time.

00:23:20.070 --> 00:23:22.620
You might bear
pain for a season.

00:23:22.620 --> 00:23:24.920
But there's a time when
everything comes together.

00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:28.740
And I guess I turn down
more board invitations

00:23:28.740 --> 00:23:29.710
than I accept.

00:23:29.710 --> 00:23:32.860
So basically, there
is a high demand

00:23:32.860 --> 00:23:35.980
right now for
people of integrity,

00:23:35.980 --> 00:23:38.696
and women more than men.

00:23:38.696 --> 00:23:40.570
And when the chips are
down, the whole world,

00:23:40.570 --> 00:23:42.590
right now, is pushing
about getting more women

00:23:42.590 --> 00:23:43.550
at the table.

00:23:43.550 --> 00:23:44.839
Because there's a gender gap.

00:23:44.839 --> 00:23:46.630
And once you don't have
women at the table,

00:23:46.630 --> 00:23:48.750
you don't have a 360-degree
view of anything.

00:23:48.750 --> 00:23:50.250
That's just the truth.

00:23:50.250 --> 00:23:52.294
Because imagine me on
the board of Cadbury.

00:23:52.294 --> 00:23:53.710
They're talking
about [INAUDIBLE].

00:23:53.710 --> 00:23:56.600
When I listen to some of what
the men say, I just laugh.

00:23:56.600 --> 00:23:58.060
Because I'm a mother.

00:23:58.060 --> 00:24:00.000
Who buys stuff for the house?

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:01.000
It's the woman.

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:03.360
Who gets the children
to drink a beverage?

00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:05.610
It is the woman that is
involved in that conversation.

00:24:05.610 --> 00:24:07.080
If you take a
decision at a table

00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:08.730
like, involving a
product like that,

00:24:08.730 --> 00:24:11.910
you don't have the woman's
view, you will miss some points.

00:24:11.910 --> 00:24:15.270
And that's the kind of thing
that happens in any boardroom

00:24:15.270 --> 00:24:17.940
without women being in place.

00:24:17.940 --> 00:24:19.190
JULIET EHUMIAN-CHIAZOR: Great.

00:24:19.190 --> 00:24:20.440
Thank you.

00:24:20.440 --> 00:24:22.590
I think we're going to
have to take a break now.

00:24:22.590 --> 00:24:23.556
[APPLAUSE]

00:24:23.556 --> 00:24:25.412
Thank you very
much, Mrs. Awosika.

00:24:25.412 --> 00:24:26.870
It's been great
having you with us.

00:24:26.870 --> 00:24:29.030
We'll take a break and
then we'll carry on.

00:24:29.030 --> 00:24:29.750
IBUKUN AWOSIKA:
Thank you very much.

00:24:29.750 --> 00:24:30.500
JULIET EHUMIAN CHIAZOR:
Thank you very much.

00:24:30.500 --> 00:24:32.000
IBUKUN AWOSIKA:
Thank you, everyone.

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:33.020
[APPLAUSE]

00:24:34.997 --> 00:24:35.830
TY BELLO: Thank you.

00:24:35.830 --> 00:24:37.392
IBUKUN AWOSIKA: I've got to run.

00:24:37.392 --> 00:24:39.350
JULIET EHUMIAN-CHIAZOR:
Welcome back, everyone.

00:24:39.350 --> 00:24:41.970
I'm very delighted
that we now have

00:24:41.970 --> 00:24:45.058
Doctor Oby Esekwesili with us.

00:24:45.058 --> 00:24:46.830
[APPLAUSE]

00:24:47.330 --> 00:24:49.032
OBY ESEKWESILI: Hi.

00:24:49.032 --> 00:24:50.490
JULIET EHUMIAN-CHIAZOR:
So I'm just

00:24:50.490 --> 00:24:54.730
going to start off going through
a few words from her profile.

00:24:54.730 --> 00:24:56.750
And then we can get
into the conversation.

00:24:56.750 --> 00:24:58.910
Once again, the theme
for this conversation

00:24:58.910 --> 00:25:01.840
is smashing the glass ceiling.

00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:06.250
And this is in honor of
International Women's Day.

00:25:06.250 --> 00:25:12.450
So Dr. Oby Esekwesili is
a senior economic adviser

00:25:12.450 --> 00:25:16.530
with Africa Economic Development
Policy Initiative, where

00:25:16.530 --> 00:25:21.330
she advises reform-committed
African heads of states

00:25:21.330 --> 00:25:24.490
on economic and policy issues.

00:25:24.490 --> 00:25:29.010
She's co-founder of the
Bring Back Our Girls citizens

00:25:29.010 --> 00:25:35.920
movement, advocating for the
safe rescue of the abducted 219

00:25:35.920 --> 00:25:39.450
schoolgirls of Chibok
community in Borno State,

00:25:39.450 --> 00:25:41.510
northern Nigeria.

00:25:41.510 --> 00:25:48.480
From 2002 to 2007, Oby worked
for the federal government

00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:52.700
of Nigeria, as Minister
of Education, Minister

00:25:52.700 --> 00:25:55.030
of Solid Minerals.

00:25:55.030 --> 00:25:59.850
She also serves on many boards,
locally and internationally,

00:25:59.850 --> 00:26:05.610
and was named as one of
2015 Time Magazine's 100

00:26:05.610 --> 00:26:09.325
most influential
people in the world.

00:26:09.325 --> 00:26:11.074
I think that deserves
a round of applause.

00:26:11.074 --> 00:26:11.573
[APPLAUSE]

00:26:11.573 --> 00:26:13.290
TY BELLO: Yes, yes.

00:26:13.290 --> 00:26:15.950
JULIET EHUMIAN-CHIAZOR: And
50 most powerful Africans,

00:26:15.950 --> 00:26:19.580
by the "New Africa" magazine.

00:26:19.580 --> 00:26:22.000
So once again, Oby, it's
so great to have you here.

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:24.236
Thank you for making it
all the way from Abuja.

00:26:24.236 --> 00:26:25.444
OBY ESEKWESILI: I'm sweating.

00:26:25.444 --> 00:26:26.850
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:27.350 --> 00:26:29.810
JULIET EHUMIAN-CHIAZOR:
What can we get you?

00:26:29.810 --> 00:26:33.770
OBY ESEKWESILI: That was meant
to make you feel a little bad--

00:26:33.770 --> 00:26:35.490
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:38.590
--for making me make this trip.

00:26:38.590 --> 00:26:39.690
It was tough.

00:26:39.690 --> 00:26:40.770
It was a tough trip.

00:26:40.770 --> 00:26:43.040
But I'm delighted
to be with you.

00:26:43.040 --> 00:26:43.573
JULIET EHUMIAN-CHIAZOR:
Yes, thank you.

00:26:43.573 --> 00:26:46.114
OBY ESEKWESILI: I wish I could
have come earlier than exactly

00:26:46.114 --> 00:26:47.740
when we scheduled.

00:26:47.740 --> 00:26:51.032
But I couldn't
control the airways.

00:26:51.032 --> 00:26:52.990
JULIET EHUMIAN-CHIAZOR:
Well, thank you so much

00:26:52.990 --> 00:26:53.660
for the commitment.

00:26:53.660 --> 00:26:54.150
OBY ESEKWESILI: Yes.

00:26:54.150 --> 00:26:55.650
JULIET EHUMIAN-CHIAZOR:
There's been

00:26:55.650 --> 00:26:58.040
a lot of expectation and
excitement about you coming.

00:26:58.040 --> 00:27:00.270
So it's great that you
were able to make it.

00:27:00.270 --> 00:27:01.750
OBY ESEKWESILI: Thank you.

00:27:01.750 --> 00:27:04.960
JULIET EHUMIAN-CHIAZOR: So
to kick off the conversation,

00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:07.730
so we're talking about smashing
the glass ceiling, right?

00:27:07.730 --> 00:27:10.250
And I think it's
worth starting out

00:27:10.250 --> 00:27:12.990
to just ask the question--
in your opinion,

00:27:12.990 --> 00:27:14.520
is there still a glass ceiling?

00:27:14.520 --> 00:27:16.270
We've come some way.

00:27:16.270 --> 00:27:18.510
Maybe a long way, maybe
not enough progress.

00:27:18.510 --> 00:27:20.620
But we've come some
way over the years.

00:27:20.620 --> 00:27:22.740
Do you feel there's
still a glass ceiling?

00:27:22.740 --> 00:27:26.760
And in your experience, what
have some examples of where

00:27:26.760 --> 00:27:29.330
you had to take
specific decisions

00:27:29.330 --> 00:27:30.850
to smash that glass ceiling?

00:27:30.850 --> 00:27:33.750
OBY ESEKWESILI: Wow, that's,
like, many questions in one.

00:27:33.750 --> 00:27:38.250
OK, so let me start
by saying what

00:27:38.250 --> 00:27:46.390
a great honor it is for me to
be sitting with a wonderful-- I

00:27:46.390 --> 00:27:49.200
think you set the
standard for what it means

00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:52.220
to be a mentor now, isn't it?

00:27:52.220 --> 00:27:57.560
To be able to discover talent
and to go all the way out

00:27:57.560 --> 00:27:59.760
to offer opportunity?

00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:01.484
[APPLAUSE]

00:28:02.450 --> 00:28:05.070
People may have their
different angles on this.

00:28:05.070 --> 00:28:09.200
But when I first saw
it, I tweeted at you.

00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:13.500
And I said, this is a brilliant
thing that you've done.

00:28:13.500 --> 00:28:18.030
So please, I join everybody in
applauding what you've done.

00:28:18.030 --> 00:28:20.790
You've not done it for
just that young woman.

00:28:20.790 --> 00:28:24.300
You've basically sent a
message to many young women

00:28:24.300 --> 00:28:31.125
that opportunity just needs
some level of diligence.

00:28:31.125 --> 00:28:35.410
Olajumoke was
diligently working hard.

00:28:35.410 --> 00:28:40.531
She was not doing something
else when opportunity met her.

00:28:40.531 --> 00:28:41.030
Thank you.

00:28:41.030 --> 00:28:42.822
TY BELLO: Thank you.

00:28:42.822 --> 00:28:45.090
OBY ESEKWESILI:
Thank you so much.

00:28:45.090 --> 00:28:50.450
Glass ceiling is anything
that may not be-- well,

00:28:50.450 --> 00:28:52.210
that's exact why it's glass.

00:28:52.210 --> 00:28:55.000
Because sometimes you're
not supposed to see it.

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:57.750
But it's somewhat
there, standing

00:28:57.750 --> 00:29:03.110
as an obstacle, as a
constraint to the progression

00:29:03.110 --> 00:29:07.400
of a woman in the
place of career,

00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:09.660
occupation, and profession.

00:29:09.660 --> 00:29:14.190
And so with glass
ceiling, there was a time

00:29:14.190 --> 00:29:18.150
in the history of the
world when it was perfectly

00:29:18.150 --> 00:29:21.550
normal for women to
have no aspiration

00:29:21.550 --> 00:29:25.580
toward any occupation,
career, or profession.

00:29:25.580 --> 00:29:32.320
And so at that time,
when the awakening begun

00:29:32.320 --> 00:29:41.700
to permeate through some set of
women, who dared to challenge

00:29:41.700 --> 00:29:44.810
that idea, that all
the woman needed to do

00:29:44.810 --> 00:29:48.320
was be a lovely
consort of a man,

00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:53.270
and sit around with other
women, just fan themselves,

00:29:53.270 --> 00:29:55.080
and have an afternoon tea.

00:29:55.080 --> 00:29:56.066
You know?

00:29:56.066 --> 00:29:59.640
When some women began
to challenge that,

00:29:59.640 --> 00:30:03.450
they needed to be able to
carry many more voices along

00:30:03.450 --> 00:30:04.690
with them.

00:30:04.690 --> 00:30:07.170
And over time, that
conversation began

00:30:07.170 --> 00:30:12.820
to happen, that what are
the barriers to this,

00:30:12.820 --> 00:30:16.430
to women being able to
fulfill their talent?

00:30:16.430 --> 00:30:20.570
And it went from just
that socialization,

00:30:20.570 --> 00:30:22.820
you know, that
solution expectation,

00:30:22.820 --> 00:30:25.630
that it was not necessary.

00:30:25.630 --> 00:30:28.980
A man could do the work,
take care of everyone.

00:30:28.980 --> 00:30:31.530
And so why are you
wasting your time,

00:30:31.530 --> 00:30:35.650
trying to do what a man can do?

00:30:35.650 --> 00:30:36.890
So you have that.

00:30:36.890 --> 00:30:41.290
You also have
religious angles to it,

00:30:41.290 --> 00:30:44.420
where some of the people
who didn't completely

00:30:44.420 --> 00:30:47.030
read their Bible
well sort of thought

00:30:47.030 --> 00:30:50.750
that when God created
Adam and Eve, he did

00:30:50.750 --> 00:30:53.970
say, to Eve, take half
the brain of Adam.

00:30:53.970 --> 00:30:57.670
There's nowhere in the scripture
that that's contained at all.

00:30:57.670 --> 00:31:02.850
So clearly, God did not have
an intention for a woman to be,

00:31:02.850 --> 00:31:06.530
in any way, less
than a human being.

00:31:06.530 --> 00:31:09.560
As a matter of fact, I
normally say to people,

00:31:09.560 --> 00:31:13.050
that in Genesis
1:26, he actually

00:31:13.050 --> 00:31:15.810
expressly, in that
conversation, said,

00:31:15.810 --> 00:31:20.470
male and female created
[INAUDIBLE] death.

00:31:20.470 --> 00:31:25.380
And then it was after that,
in 28 of that same Genesis 1,

00:31:25.380 --> 00:31:28.055
he then says, be fruitful.

00:31:28.055 --> 00:31:29.430
JULIET EHUMIAN
CHIAZOR: Multiply.

00:31:29.430 --> 00:31:30.471
OBY ESEKWESILI: Multiply.

00:31:30.471 --> 00:31:32.130
Replenish the earth.

00:31:32.130 --> 00:31:33.100
Dominate.

00:31:33.100 --> 00:31:34.500
subdue.

00:31:34.500 --> 00:31:36.120
Who was he speaking to?

00:31:36.120 --> 00:31:39.160
He was speaking to
both males and females.

00:31:39.160 --> 00:31:42.150
So if he had an intention
for any one of them

00:31:42.150 --> 00:31:46.030
to be subordinated in terms
of their intellectual capacity

00:31:46.030 --> 00:31:47.750
to be the best
that they could be,

00:31:47.750 --> 00:31:49.860
he would expressly have said it.

00:31:49.860 --> 00:31:54.760
Even though God does not speak
too often, when he speaks,

00:31:54.760 --> 00:31:58.720
he is very composed in
trying to convey his message.

00:31:58.720 --> 00:32:02.630
So religious is there,
for the human mind,

00:32:02.630 --> 00:32:04.600
where they created a barrier.

00:32:04.600 --> 00:32:09.610
And then there are certain
things that are geographical,

00:32:09.610 --> 00:32:14.100
where in certain environments,
they just need topography

00:32:14.100 --> 00:32:16.770
and the geography of
it means that there

00:32:16.770 --> 00:32:19.850
is an obstacle to women
being able to respond

00:32:19.850 --> 00:32:23.910
to some of the kind of context
within which they operate.

00:32:23.910 --> 00:32:28.070
And of course, economic,
family issues, and all of that.

00:32:28.070 --> 00:32:32.240
All these obstacles and
barriers act as glass ceiling.

00:32:32.240 --> 00:32:37.270
But when you now take
it to the micro level,

00:32:37.270 --> 00:32:41.790
a glass ceiling is whatever
exists in terms of the way

00:32:41.790 --> 00:32:46.820
that human resources
is incentivized

00:32:46.820 --> 00:32:50.331
within the workplace.

00:32:50.331 --> 00:32:54.850
And if it is incentivized
in a particular way,

00:32:54.850 --> 00:33:00.570
any part of it that hinders
the progress of women

00:33:00.570 --> 00:33:01.472
is a glass ceiling.

00:33:01.472 --> 00:33:02.680
JULIET EHUMIAN-CHIAZOR: Yeah.

00:33:02.680 --> 00:33:06.710
OBY ESEKWESILI: So if the
incentive in the workplace

00:33:06.710 --> 00:33:11.015
does not make itself amenable--

00:33:11.015 --> 00:33:12.390
JULIET EHUMIAN
CHIAZOR: Enabling.

00:33:12.390 --> 00:33:14.020
OBY ESEKWESILI: And
enabling-- that's

00:33:14.020 --> 00:33:16.900
the word-- enabling
of women, because

00:33:16.900 --> 00:33:21.790
of some of the
variations in the pattern

00:33:21.790 --> 00:33:26.660
and the lives of women that
could require the workplace

00:33:26.660 --> 00:33:28.360
to adapt.

00:33:28.360 --> 00:33:38.450
And with that adaptability, help
them to overcome those hidden

00:33:38.450 --> 00:33:39.620
barriers.

00:33:39.620 --> 00:33:42.050
Then you have a glass ceiling.

00:33:42.050 --> 00:33:45.314
So I've taken it from the global
to the macro, and then to the--

00:33:45.314 --> 00:33:46.480
JULIET EHUMIAN-CHIAZOR: Yes.

00:33:46.480 --> 00:33:48.640
OBY ESEKWESILI: To the
femme level, isn't it?

00:33:48.640 --> 00:33:50.098
JULIET EHUMIAN
CHIAZOR: Absolutely.

00:33:50.098 --> 00:33:51.280
And to the personal level.

00:33:51.280 --> 00:33:52.450
OBY ESEKWESILI: And
to the personal level.

00:33:52.450 --> 00:33:53.950
JULIET EHUMIAN-CHIAZOR: From
your own personal experience,

00:33:53.950 --> 00:33:55.690
because you're
quite accomplished.

00:33:55.690 --> 00:33:58.350
And one can say, you're a
great example of someone

00:33:58.350 --> 00:34:00.620
who's been able to
break potentially

00:34:00.620 --> 00:34:02.146
many ceilings along the way--

00:34:02.146 --> 00:34:03.930
[APPLAUSE]

00:34:03.930 --> 00:34:06.060
OBY ESEKWESILI: Ah,
that's [INAUDIBLE].

00:34:06.060 --> 00:34:07.996
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:10.420 --> 00:34:12.610
JULIET EHUMIAN-CHIAZOR:
Can you share an example

00:34:12.610 --> 00:34:16.020
of a situation in your life
where you had to take decisions

00:34:16.020 --> 00:34:19.698
consciously to help
you break through?

00:34:19.698 --> 00:34:21.739
OBY ESEKWESILI: You see,
one of the things that I

00:34:21.739 --> 00:34:24.000
loved about what
Ibukun was saying

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:25.864
is she used the word contextual.

00:34:25.864 --> 00:34:27.739
I don't know in what
light she was saying it.

00:34:27.739 --> 00:34:30.050
But I think I heard
that word, contextual.

00:34:30.050 --> 00:34:31.760
Context is so important.

00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:35.800
And in policy school, I was
taught that without context,

00:34:35.800 --> 00:34:37.010
you run into trouble.

00:34:37.010 --> 00:34:40.350
The reason I say this is
that there are some women,

00:34:40.350 --> 00:34:47.860
obviously, who have somehow
managed to not see this glass,

00:34:47.860 --> 00:34:49.070
even when it was--

00:34:49.070 --> 00:34:49.570
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:49.570 --> 00:34:50.520
JULIET EHUMIAN-CHIAZOR:
Right there.

00:34:50.520 --> 00:34:52.936
OBY ESEKWESILI: I don't know
why some of you are laughing.

00:34:52.936 --> 00:34:54.150
Just don't see the glass.

00:34:54.150 --> 00:34:56.830
You just work through.

00:34:56.830 --> 00:34:59.760
And before the glass knows,
you have walked through.

00:34:59.760 --> 00:35:01.930
It's probably
shattered and broken.

00:35:01.930 --> 00:35:04.010
But you just keep walking.

00:35:04.010 --> 00:35:08.390
But it's not the same for
all of our experiences.

00:35:08.390 --> 00:35:14.580
So my sense is where I have--
I'm trying so hard to say,

00:35:14.580 --> 00:35:19.370
that this was the exact moment
that I felt like somebody tried

00:35:19.370 --> 00:35:21.640
to stop me on my
part because I'm

00:35:21.640 --> 00:35:27.730
a woman in my expression
of my calling,

00:35:27.730 --> 00:35:30.720
in my expression of my talent.

00:35:30.720 --> 00:35:33.312
And I'm running into a block.

00:35:35.860 --> 00:35:41.080
And that's probably because
another important part

00:35:41.080 --> 00:35:44.140
of the glass
ceiling conversation

00:35:44.140 --> 00:35:51.300
is actually the glass ceiling
that the individual places

00:35:51.300 --> 00:35:53.740
on themselves.

00:35:53.740 --> 00:35:54.380
OK?

00:35:54.380 --> 00:35:55.588
JULIET EHUMIAN-CHIAZOR: Yeah.

00:35:55.588 --> 00:35:58.732
OBY ESEKWESILI: So if there
is a mental roadblock,

00:35:58.732 --> 00:35:59.690
that's a glass ceiling.

00:35:59.690 --> 00:36:00.898
JULIET EHUMIAN-CHIAZOR: Yeah.

00:36:00.898 --> 00:36:03.330
OBY ESEKWESILI: When
a woman sort of says

00:36:03.330 --> 00:36:06.750
to herself, every time that
somebody does something to me,

00:36:06.750 --> 00:36:09.950
it's because I'm a
woman, that's a crush.

00:36:09.950 --> 00:36:14.150
And it's going to
always take you down.

00:36:14.150 --> 00:36:16.180
There's nowhere else to go.

00:36:16.180 --> 00:36:20.610
So just being able to
have a mindset shift

00:36:20.610 --> 00:36:24.590
can be a very important, as
part of the way of shattering

00:36:24.590 --> 00:36:27.420
the glass ceiling.

00:36:27.420 --> 00:36:32.550
But where, I would say,
that I have come face

00:36:32.550 --> 00:36:36.640
to face with this matter
of oh boy, you're a woman,

00:36:36.640 --> 00:36:40.310
is actually not the
workplace experience.

00:36:40.310 --> 00:36:43.580
It's the global
experience, where

00:36:43.580 --> 00:36:47.830
culturally-- which is
part of the glass ceiling

00:36:47.830 --> 00:36:52.580
that we see in the country
a lot-- people sort of

00:36:52.580 --> 00:36:59.610
have make presumptions about
how power relationship ought

00:36:59.610 --> 00:37:01.020
to look like.

00:37:01.020 --> 00:37:03.360
If they've made
assumptions, and if they

00:37:03.360 --> 00:37:06.370
have these presumptuous
attitude, then what

00:37:06.370 --> 00:37:09.980
they're going to think it
is why should a woman appear

00:37:09.980 --> 00:37:11.420
to be strong?

00:37:11.420 --> 00:37:15.160
So you can have instances where
people say, you are so strong.

00:37:15.160 --> 00:37:16.540
Oh!

00:37:16.540 --> 00:37:21.160
I wonder who Oby
Esekwesili's husband is.

00:37:21.160 --> 00:37:24.330
And I'm thinking
to myself, if only

00:37:24.330 --> 00:37:27.900
I knew that I have
a husband who,

00:37:27.900 --> 00:37:29.830
if he just gives me
one eye like this,

00:37:29.830 --> 00:37:33.680
I would just find
in seat quietly.

00:37:33.680 --> 00:37:35.620
Because, you know?

00:37:35.620 --> 00:37:36.120
You know.

00:37:36.120 --> 00:37:37.328
JULIET EHUMIAN-CHIAZOR: Yeah.

00:37:37.328 --> 00:37:40.250
OBY ESEKWESILI: So that's my
own experience of glass ceiling.

00:37:40.250 --> 00:37:42.650
It's a macro, level 1.

00:37:42.650 --> 00:37:47.720
It's not the level where, in
my profession, in my work,

00:37:47.720 --> 00:37:50.870
anyone has said to
me, you're a woman.

00:37:50.870 --> 00:37:54.092
So there are limitations
that we must place on you.

00:37:54.092 --> 00:37:55.300
JULIET EHUMIAN-CHIAZOR: Yeah.

00:37:55.300 --> 00:37:59.430
I certainly do agree that
context varies from one person

00:37:59.430 --> 00:38:02.170
to another, and actually
plays a key role

00:38:02.170 --> 00:38:04.010
in looking at this holistically.

00:38:04.010 --> 00:38:09.150
And the fact that the mental
block is a very big one

00:38:09.150 --> 00:38:10.480
to break through.

00:38:10.480 --> 00:38:13.050
And thinking about
that mental block,

00:38:13.050 --> 00:38:17.240
sometimes that comes
from the cultural context

00:38:17.240 --> 00:38:18.420
that we find ourselves in.

00:38:18.420 --> 00:38:20.770
So my next question
would be to TY.

00:38:20.770 --> 00:38:22.300
And thank you for staying on.

00:38:22.300 --> 00:38:23.169
TY BELLO: Thank you.

00:38:23.169 --> 00:38:24.460
OBY ESEKWESILI: You're welcome.

00:38:24.460 --> 00:38:26.860
JULIET EHUMIAN-CHIAZOR:
From a cultural perspective,

00:38:26.860 --> 00:38:31.200
what role do you see
our culture playing

00:38:31.200 --> 00:38:36.440
around either creating limiting
or expansive opportunities

00:38:36.440 --> 00:38:38.090
for women?

00:38:38.090 --> 00:38:44.720
TY BELLO: Well, like she said,
I can only speak for myself

00:38:44.720 --> 00:38:45.843
in certain instances.

00:38:45.843 --> 00:38:47.884
Because I know, for
instance, I'm a photographer.

00:38:47.884 --> 00:38:51.140
And I remember when I
started making images,

00:38:51.140 --> 00:38:53.420
and my images started
getting noticed.

00:38:53.420 --> 00:38:55.410
TY Bello was a man.

00:38:55.410 --> 00:38:57.900
And wherever I showed
up, people were shocked.

00:38:57.900 --> 00:39:00.280
And they're, like, oh,
is your guy on his way?

00:39:00.280 --> 00:39:02.116
And I'm like, this is he.

00:39:02.116 --> 00:39:03.034
You know?

00:39:03.034 --> 00:39:04.450
JULIET EHUMIAN-CHIAZOR:
She is he.

00:39:04.450 --> 00:39:05.520
TY BELLO: She is he.

00:39:05.520 --> 00:39:06.510
You know?

00:39:06.510 --> 00:39:10.690
But I believe it's
not just culture.

00:39:10.690 --> 00:39:12.800
I also think it's history.

00:39:12.800 --> 00:39:15.100
How many women have done this?

00:39:15.100 --> 00:39:17.160
And how many women
have done that?

00:39:17.160 --> 00:39:19.410
So if no woman has
done this, so what

00:39:19.410 --> 00:39:22.540
gives you the audacity
to think that you can?

00:39:22.540 --> 00:39:24.690
I can give an example.

00:39:24.690 --> 00:39:29.140
When I got the opportunity,
in the last administration,

00:39:29.140 --> 00:39:36.950
to document the presidency on
a very, very intimate level,

00:39:36.950 --> 00:39:39.370
and to go behind the scenes
and actually photograph what

00:39:39.370 --> 00:39:43.850
happened, I realized that it
was important for history.

00:39:43.850 --> 00:39:45.670
I don't know who Abacha was.

00:39:45.670 --> 00:39:48.070
I don't know how he smiled.

00:39:48.070 --> 00:39:51.340
I don't know who
got to document him.

00:39:51.340 --> 00:39:54.890
Yes, we saw him behind
the dark sunglasses.

00:39:54.890 --> 00:39:56.980
We saw him shake a few hands.

00:39:56.980 --> 00:39:59.570
But we never saw any
vulnerable moment.

00:39:59.570 --> 00:40:01.690
We never saw him in doubt.

00:40:01.690 --> 00:40:05.740
And I felt like, OK, I need
to take on this job well.

00:40:05.740 --> 00:40:08.370
And I know that I'm
surrounded by men.

00:40:08.370 --> 00:40:10.360
And I know that I'm
surrounded by security,

00:40:10.360 --> 00:40:13.280
that are going to try and
create boundaries for me,

00:40:13.280 --> 00:40:17.250
to tell me how far I can
go based on how far people

00:40:17.250 --> 00:40:18.630
in history have gone.

00:40:18.630 --> 00:40:23.220
So for instance, when
people in government walk,

00:40:23.220 --> 00:40:26.790
you don't move close
beyond a certain distance.

00:40:26.790 --> 00:40:29.350
You don't move close
beyond a certain level.

00:40:29.350 --> 00:40:30.250
And I'm like, no.

00:40:30.250 --> 00:40:31.390
I want to get this shot.

00:40:31.390 --> 00:40:32.690
I'm shooting wide angle.

00:40:32.690 --> 00:40:34.000
I need to move closer.

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:36.080
So it was always a struggle.

00:40:36.080 --> 00:40:39.780
But I do realize something--
that because I fought hard,

00:40:39.780 --> 00:40:42.870
and because I constantly
broke barriers,

00:40:42.870 --> 00:40:46.590
people who have come after me
have found it a little easier.

00:40:46.590 --> 00:40:48.460
They haven't had to explain.

00:40:48.460 --> 00:40:50.510
And they haven't
had to show work.

00:40:50.510 --> 00:40:52.560
They haven't had to
stand for 72 hours

00:40:52.560 --> 00:40:54.110
to let them know,
yes, I'm a woman.

00:40:54.110 --> 00:40:54.930
But I am tough.

00:40:54.930 --> 00:40:55.580
And I'm strong.

00:40:55.580 --> 00:40:57.660
I will hold my
camera, two of them.

00:40:57.660 --> 00:41:00.220
I'll hold my cameras in
my hand for 72 hours.

00:41:00.220 --> 00:41:01.590
And I will not budge.

00:41:01.590 --> 00:41:03.700
Because I'm serious
about what I'm doing.

00:41:03.700 --> 00:41:06.620
So sometimes I think
it's working extra hard,

00:41:06.620 --> 00:41:10.530
knowing that it's
not just about you

00:41:10.530 --> 00:41:12.350
and your own
personal experience.

00:41:12.350 --> 00:41:15.510
But realizing that every
time you push boundaries,

00:41:15.510 --> 00:41:17.420
you're creating and
you're writing history.

00:41:17.420 --> 00:41:21.310
You're telling a new story,
that somebody else can say, hey,

00:41:21.310 --> 00:41:23.040
this is how it's done.

00:41:23.040 --> 00:41:23.835
You create new.

00:41:23.835 --> 00:41:26.010
This is how it's done.

00:41:26.010 --> 00:41:26.550
You know?

00:41:26.550 --> 00:41:28.190
[APPLAUSE]

00:41:29.560 --> 00:41:30.930
JULIET EHUMIAN-CHIAZOR: Great.

00:41:30.930 --> 00:41:34.290
And you've been quite
successful in transitioning

00:41:34.290 --> 00:41:36.822
from a singer/songwriter
to a photographer.

00:41:36.822 --> 00:41:38.780
TY BELLO: Oh, now I'm
trying to transition back

00:41:38.780 --> 00:41:41.120
It's kind of tough now.

00:41:41.120 --> 00:41:43.710
OBY ESEKWESILI: So I think
you've alluded to that.

00:41:43.710 --> 00:41:46.720
But just in a bit more
detail, some of the things

00:41:46.720 --> 00:41:48.650
that you did, or
your unique selling

00:41:48.650 --> 00:41:51.160
point, around being able
to successfully make

00:41:51.160 --> 00:41:52.680
that transition.

00:41:52.680 --> 00:41:56.340
And actually, being
dominant in an industry that

00:41:56.340 --> 00:41:59.110
is highly occupied by men.

00:42:01.644 --> 00:42:03.560
TY BELLO: It's about
creating new definitions.

00:42:03.560 --> 00:42:06.590
I remember when I told
my mom and her friends

00:42:06.590 --> 00:42:12.684
that I wanted to be a
photographer in 1999, a very

00:42:12.684 --> 00:42:14.350
close auntie, who
really cared about me,

00:42:14.350 --> 00:42:16.611
was, like, [INAUDIBLE] why now?

00:42:16.611 --> 00:42:17.360
Do you understand?

00:42:17.360 --> 00:42:19.040
Because prior to
that, in her mind,

00:42:19.040 --> 00:42:21.960
a photographer is someone who is
struggling and carries a camera

00:42:21.960 --> 00:42:23.520
and is with bathroom sleepers.

00:42:23.520 --> 00:42:24.255
You know?

00:42:24.255 --> 00:42:28.622
They did not have a picture
of what I was aspiring to.

00:42:28.622 --> 00:42:30.080
Unfortunately,
thank goodness, they

00:42:30.080 --> 00:42:32.210
didn't know that I didn't
have a picture either.

00:42:32.210 --> 00:42:35.930
It's just that I had a very
strong conviction that this

00:42:35.930 --> 00:42:37.230
is something I'm meant to do.

00:42:37.230 --> 00:42:38.813
I don't know why I'm
meant to do this.

00:42:38.813 --> 00:42:40.860
But I know that I can do this.

00:42:40.860 --> 00:42:43.680
But I also found out
that it's all the same.

00:42:43.680 --> 00:42:45.890
It's about composition
and telling stories.

00:42:45.890 --> 00:42:47.570
You write a song,
you tell a story.

00:42:47.570 --> 00:42:49.300
You make an image,
you tell a story.

00:42:49.300 --> 00:42:52.560
What I do with my work is
to tell people stories.

00:42:52.560 --> 00:42:54.800
Even when I take a
portrait of a woman,

00:42:54.800 --> 00:42:57.470
I want her to see
herself differently.

00:42:57.470 --> 00:42:58.500
Do you understand?

00:42:58.500 --> 00:43:02.534
It's so extreme that sometimes
I would photograph someone.

00:43:02.534 --> 00:43:04.450
And I would meet them
two years down the line,

00:43:04.450 --> 00:43:05.408
I can't recognize them.

00:43:05.408 --> 00:43:08.810
Because I have, in my
head, created this persona.

00:43:08.810 --> 00:43:10.090
And that is all that I see.

00:43:10.090 --> 00:43:15.210
I see every woman at her
highest and most beautiful,

00:43:15.210 --> 00:43:16.590
and the strongest.

00:43:16.590 --> 00:43:19.400
And I sell them that story.

00:43:19.400 --> 00:43:22.010
And when they believe
the story, they

00:43:22.010 --> 00:43:24.430
become that person
in front of my lens.

00:43:24.430 --> 00:43:26.380
And it's is the same
thing with music.

00:43:26.380 --> 00:43:29.200
So I find it very easy to go
back and forth between the two

00:43:29.200 --> 00:43:29.700
mediums.

00:43:29.700 --> 00:43:30.720
Because it's exactly
the same thing.

00:43:30.720 --> 00:43:32.470
You're trying to inspire people.

00:43:32.470 --> 00:43:35.552
You're trying to show them
this is really who you are.

00:43:35.552 --> 00:43:39.440
Or even if I'm just
reiterating who I am,

00:43:39.440 --> 00:43:41.530
you know, and becoming a
mirror for other people.

00:43:41.530 --> 00:43:45.560
And so that's why it's so
easy to go between the two art

00:43:45.560 --> 00:43:46.514
forms for me.

00:43:46.514 --> 00:43:47.930
JULIET EHUMIAN
CHIAZOR: Fantastic.

00:43:47.930 --> 00:43:48.290
TY BELLO: Thank you.

00:43:48.290 --> 00:43:49.831
JULIET EHUMIAN-CHIAZOR:
That's great.

00:43:49.831 --> 00:43:53.050
And I think that's
very powerful as well,

00:43:53.050 --> 00:43:56.830
getting people to see the
grandest version of themselves,

00:43:56.830 --> 00:43:59.990
and believing that, and
having that come through

00:43:59.990 --> 00:44:00.870
in photography.

00:44:00.870 --> 00:44:01.672
TY BELLO: Yeah.

00:44:01.672 --> 00:44:03.130
JULIET EHUMIAN-CHIAZOR:
Oby, you've

00:44:03.130 --> 00:44:06.930
been very vocal about the Bring
Back Our Girls Campaign, which

00:44:06.930 --> 00:44:09.920
is a very worthwhile cause.

00:44:09.920 --> 00:44:13.250
And certainly, our
hearts and prayers

00:44:13.250 --> 00:44:16.450
go to the girls
and their families.

00:44:16.450 --> 00:44:22.020
Do you feel gender has
played a role at all?

00:44:22.020 --> 00:44:25.856
Do you feel equally supported
by men in this campaign?

00:44:25.856 --> 00:44:34.340
OBY ESEKWESILI: Oh, actually, a
lot of the people who came out

00:44:34.340 --> 00:44:41.000
on the 13th of April, when we
had asked our citizens to come

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:47.390
out after many weeks of
social media advocacy,

00:44:47.390 --> 00:44:52.375
and we went to do a physical
advocacy by turning up

00:44:52.375 --> 00:44:55.090
at the unity fountain, a lot
of the people who came out

00:44:55.090 --> 00:44:56.900
were men also.

00:44:56.900 --> 00:45:01.150
But it was mostly
women that co-convened.

00:45:01.150 --> 00:45:05.030
So we had [INAUDIBLE]
of a Laos man

00:45:05.030 --> 00:45:08.990
who was really the
young woman that said,

00:45:08.990 --> 00:45:10.220
social media is good.

00:45:10.220 --> 00:45:14.070
But it looks like
these people are not.

00:45:14.070 --> 00:45:16.130
So it's important that
you see that people

00:45:16.130 --> 00:45:18.484
are on the straight,
really impress that.

00:45:18.484 --> 00:45:19.900
JULIET EHUMIAN
CHIAZOR: Of course.

00:45:19.900 --> 00:45:23.300
OBY EZEKWESILI: --in
the rescue of the girls.

00:45:23.300 --> 00:45:26.560
And then Miriam
[INAUDIBLE], saw that

00:45:26.560 --> 00:45:30.530
through [INAUDIBLE] and
I, and then [INAUDIBLE].

00:45:30.530 --> 00:45:35.740
So we then began to convene
with people to come out

00:45:35.740 --> 00:45:37.422
of that [INAUDIBLE].

00:45:37.422 --> 00:45:40.175
And many men came out.

00:45:40.175 --> 00:45:48.310
And for majority of the men that
have connected to the tragedy,

00:45:48.310 --> 00:45:52.170
it's been because
they would always

00:45:52.170 --> 00:45:57.770
say, I don't want to
imagine my daughter

00:45:57.770 --> 00:46:02.720
in the hand of terrorists, or
in the hands of terrorists.

00:46:02.720 --> 00:46:12.520
If we set the standard that it
is perfectly OK for the poorer

00:46:12.520 --> 00:46:17.880
segment of our society to good
through tragedies of the kind

00:46:17.880 --> 00:46:20.240
that the Chibok community
has gone through,

00:46:20.240 --> 00:46:22.530
that the kind of the
parents of our Chibok girls

00:46:22.530 --> 00:46:25.320
have gone through,
and we, the elite,

00:46:25.320 --> 00:46:28.750
can find the moment to
sit down and discuss

00:46:28.750 --> 00:46:34.190
whether it was-- should they
have done this or should they?

00:46:34.190 --> 00:46:36.570
Oh, come on.

00:46:36.570 --> 00:46:41.070
If children that
I give birth to,

00:46:41.070 --> 00:46:48.050
or any of the other elite class
give birth to were abducted,

00:46:48.050 --> 00:46:52.290
you think the government would
have kept quiet for as long

00:46:52.290 --> 00:46:53.330
as it did?

00:46:53.330 --> 00:46:55.550
It would never have happened.

00:46:55.550 --> 00:47:00.800
It's simply that we are now
a society where we actually

00:47:00.800 --> 00:47:06.350
are insulated and isolated
from the poorer segment.

00:47:06.350 --> 00:47:10.440
So if it happens, it's one
of the things that happened.

00:47:10.440 --> 00:47:16.180
We can comfortably just
walk on by, walk on by.

00:47:16.180 --> 00:47:18.490
I command, for our Chibok
girls, on the basis

00:47:18.490 --> 00:47:24.370
of my sense of outrage that
those girls were completely

00:47:24.370 --> 00:47:28.230
being ignored by the
system that should

00:47:28.230 --> 00:47:31.560
have responded to
the distress call

00:47:31.560 --> 00:47:34.110
that they had been abducted.

00:47:34.110 --> 00:47:36.868
The issue is where
are the Chibok girls?

00:47:36.868 --> 00:47:39.770
Where are girls
who went to school?

00:47:39.770 --> 00:47:43.070
If you asked me to explain
my personal connection

00:47:43.070 --> 00:47:45.890
to their story, that's
easy and simple.

00:47:45.890 --> 00:47:47.850
And I would do it.

00:47:47.850 --> 00:47:54.490
Brono State was the key state
alongside [? Ubi, ?] that

00:47:54.490 --> 00:47:56.930
when I was Minister
of Education, had

00:47:56.930 --> 00:48:03.360
the worst poverty level in
education, girls and boys.

00:48:03.360 --> 00:48:06.770
So for every four
young men in school,

00:48:06.770 --> 00:48:09.540
only one girl in school.

00:48:09.540 --> 00:48:14.310
And we needed to bridge
this disparity in education.

00:48:14.310 --> 00:48:17.800
So Brono state was a
profile sate for us.

00:48:17.800 --> 00:48:20.650
In fact, it was a major
state of intervention.

00:48:20.650 --> 00:48:26.790
It was this lovely young
woman, Ayesha [INAUDIBLE]

00:48:26.790 --> 00:48:32.540
was my task team person
for gender education,

00:48:32.540 --> 00:48:35.290
you know, girl child
education reforms.

00:48:35.290 --> 00:48:38.090
So for a new state,
it was major.

00:48:38.090 --> 00:48:45.130
Now, when those girls were
abducted, I was angry.

00:48:45.130 --> 00:48:48.510
Because I sort of
thought, so parents

00:48:48.510 --> 00:48:52.720
who were convinced, in a
very difficult environment,

00:48:52.720 --> 00:48:58.490
to send their doctors to school,
then we didn't safeguard them,

00:48:58.490 --> 00:49:00.450
they are gone.

00:49:00.450 --> 00:49:02.320
And they are with Boko Haram.

00:49:02.320 --> 00:49:04.340
And all we're going
to do, as a society,

00:49:04.340 --> 00:49:06.900
is say, another
one bites the dust.

00:49:07.797 --> 00:49:09.380
JULIET EHUMIAN-CHIAZOR:
Totally agree.

00:49:09.380 --> 00:49:10.270
OBY EZEKWESILI: I
wasn't going to.

00:49:10.270 --> 00:49:11.436
JULIET EHUMIAN-CHIAZOR: Yes.

00:49:11.436 --> 00:49:16.700
I think, definitely,
it goes without saying,

00:49:16.700 --> 00:49:19.450
that fact that it is a
tragedy in our society,

00:49:19.450 --> 00:49:23.630
to have that happen, because
you have been such a powerhouse,

00:49:23.630 --> 00:49:25.520
standing firm for
what you believe in.

00:49:25.520 --> 00:49:28.130
So it's really
speaking to people

00:49:28.130 --> 00:49:31.344
who go through
situations where you're

00:49:31.344 --> 00:49:32.510
trying to fight for a cause.

00:49:32.510 --> 00:49:37.360
You're trying to take a stand,
either as a man or a woman.

00:49:37.360 --> 00:49:39.360
But in this context, as a woman.

00:49:39.360 --> 00:49:44.240
And then you're having a
lot of external challenges

00:49:44.240 --> 00:49:46.640
and feedback, being able
to really stand firm

00:49:46.640 --> 00:49:49.870
in that, inspiring
people in that situation.

00:49:49.870 --> 00:49:53.740
OBY EZEKWESILI: No, I get
your point, which is basically

00:49:53.740 --> 00:49:58.020
to say to people in
my response, you've

00:49:58.020 --> 00:50:00.280
got to set your
eyes on the ball.

00:50:00.280 --> 00:50:03.600
You know, the girls were more
important than anything anybody

00:50:03.600 --> 00:50:04.100
was doing.

00:50:04.100 --> 00:50:06.630
I mean, one of the
things that happened

00:50:06.630 --> 00:50:08.920
in the course of
the advocacy, where

00:50:08.920 --> 00:50:12.850
young men were sent to beat
us up, at the Unity Fountain.

00:50:12.850 --> 00:50:14.490
And some of those
young men, they

00:50:14.490 --> 00:50:18.060
would run all the way
to try to hit at me.

00:50:18.060 --> 00:50:21.830
And something would say to
them, we can't hit this woman.

00:50:21.830 --> 00:50:23.930
And they would run back.

00:50:23.930 --> 00:50:27.460
They hit a couple of our people.

00:50:27.460 --> 00:50:30.100
But they would come
all the way again.

00:50:30.100 --> 00:50:33.350
And they would sort of,
like, wanting to push.

00:50:33.350 --> 00:50:35.580
And something would
just hold them back.

00:50:35.580 --> 00:50:37.290
And they would run back.

00:50:37.290 --> 00:50:39.300
I saw that.

00:50:39.300 --> 00:50:41.720
So whatever it is that
you can experience,

00:50:41.720 --> 00:50:44.430
we experienced in this advocacy.

00:50:44.430 --> 00:50:49.840
And for me, it was one
of the saddest things.

00:50:49.840 --> 00:50:53.310
But what you've got
to say to yourself,

00:50:53.310 --> 00:50:56.645
taking that inspirational
window on this,

00:50:56.645 --> 00:51:02.320
is look-- what costs
can I possibly pay now,

00:51:02.320 --> 00:51:07.210
that can come close
to what these girls?

00:51:07.210 --> 00:51:14.200
I keep wondering, that 219 young
women interested in education.

00:51:14.200 --> 00:51:16.850
Can you imagine,
with all that they've

00:51:16.850 --> 00:51:22.970
been through, that we then find
these girls and rescue them?

00:51:22.970 --> 00:51:25.800
These girls would be
the greatest symbol

00:51:25.800 --> 00:51:26.750
for girl child--

00:51:26.750 --> 00:51:28.010
AUDIENCE: Education.

00:51:28.010 --> 00:51:28.660
OBY EZEKWESILI: You understand?

00:51:28.660 --> 00:51:30.140
They will be the
greatest symbol.

00:51:30.140 --> 00:51:30.540
JULIET EHUMIAN
CHIAZOR: Absolutely.

00:51:30.540 --> 00:51:32.400
OBY EZEKWESILI: All
through the ages,

00:51:32.400 --> 00:51:36.190
any other parent that would
say, my child would not

00:51:36.190 --> 00:51:37.610
go to school.

00:51:37.610 --> 00:51:42.980
These children would be like
a reflector saying to them,

00:51:42.980 --> 00:51:44.470
are you really sure?

00:51:44.470 --> 00:51:45.670
Just look at me.

00:51:45.670 --> 00:51:47.240
I went through all of this.

00:51:47.240 --> 00:51:50.380
I have now gone back and
completed my education.

00:51:50.380 --> 00:51:52.314
See how I am.

00:51:52.314 --> 00:51:54.480
Are you saying that like
daughter cannot be like me?

00:51:54.480 --> 00:51:57.710
It would be you and I,
now needing to plead.

00:51:57.710 --> 00:52:01.410
It would be those girls
making a clear statement.

00:52:01.410 --> 00:52:04.702
And it would be legacy
for the people of Chibok.

00:52:04.702 --> 00:52:06.410
JULIET EHUMIAN-CHIAZOR:
Yeah, absolutely.

00:52:06.410 --> 00:52:10.830
Especially as we talk about
education, education for women

00:52:10.830 --> 00:52:13.990
at all levels, in the
rural areas and everywhere.

00:52:13.990 --> 00:52:17.550
As a nation, we have a
responsibility to the girls.

00:52:17.550 --> 00:52:26.220
And I think we are all united in
our intentions and our prayers,

00:52:26.220 --> 00:52:29.920
that the girls do actually
come back home safely

00:52:29.920 --> 00:52:31.030
to their families.

00:52:31.030 --> 00:52:36.530
What's then, the biggest impact
or cost of speaking your mind?

00:52:36.530 --> 00:52:39.210
Not necessarily about
this campaign in General

00:52:39.210 --> 00:52:41.840
OBY EZEKWESILI: Yes.

00:52:41.840 --> 00:52:45.780
And knock on my head, when
I was younger, you know?

00:52:45.780 --> 00:52:47.580
[LAUGHTER]

00:52:48.700 --> 00:52:49.907
You can relate, right?

00:52:49.907 --> 00:52:51.220
They did it to you also.

00:52:51.220 --> 00:52:52.130
[LAUGHTER]

00:52:52.130 --> 00:52:53.390
JULIET EHUMIAN-CHIAZOR: I
think we can all relate.

00:52:53.390 --> 00:52:54.223
OBY EZEKWESILI: Yes!

00:52:54.223 --> 00:52:55.815
[LAUGHTER]

00:52:57.510 --> 00:53:02.000
But it was helpful
that I had parents

00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:05.210
that encouraged a voice.

00:53:05.210 --> 00:53:06.050
You know?

00:53:06.050 --> 00:53:07.810
They encouraged voice.

00:53:07.810 --> 00:53:11.810
They wanted us to take
ownership of our conviction.

00:53:11.810 --> 00:53:16.730
So my dad always used the time,
courage of conviction a lot,

00:53:16.730 --> 00:53:18.330
in raising us.

00:53:18.330 --> 00:53:24.900
And so a lot of the
times when I think

00:53:24.900 --> 00:53:31.940
of my opinion, my
view on an issue,

00:53:31.940 --> 00:53:37.670
I am saying it an
expression of my values?

00:53:37.670 --> 00:53:39.570
If it's an expression
of my values,

00:53:39.570 --> 00:53:42.630
I'm not prepared to negotiate.

00:53:42.630 --> 00:53:47.020
Because it's OK to
negotiate everything.

00:53:47.020 --> 00:53:48.510
But my values?

00:53:48.510 --> 00:53:50.010
No.

00:53:50.010 --> 00:53:52.470
I wouldn't negotiate my values.

00:53:52.470 --> 00:53:58.500
My voice on issues
are a reflection

00:53:58.500 --> 00:54:00.830
of the values that
I hold strong,

00:54:00.830 --> 00:54:02.796
and that I hold dear to.

00:54:02.796 --> 00:54:03.296
Yeah.

00:54:03.296 --> 00:54:04.716
TY BELLO: That's fantastic.

00:54:04.716 --> 00:54:06.132
JULIET EHUMIAN
CHIAZOR: Fantastic.

00:54:06.132 --> 00:54:07.000
[APPLAUSE]

00:54:07.060 --> 00:54:08.560
JULIET EHUMIAN-CHIAZOR:
When we look

00:54:08.560 --> 00:54:10.510
at the context in
the country today,

00:54:10.510 --> 00:54:12.050
we've got a lot of challenges.

00:54:12.050 --> 00:54:15.340
We have a devaluation
of the naira,

00:54:15.340 --> 00:54:17.940
various corrupt practices, etc.

00:54:17.940 --> 00:54:20.700
What advice do you have
for young people in Nigeria

00:54:20.700 --> 00:54:24.560
today, in terms of how
they can apply themselves,

00:54:24.560 --> 00:54:27.960
not giving up on any
dreams that they have,

00:54:27.960 --> 00:54:31.420
you can still be the
best that you can be.

00:54:31.420 --> 00:54:34.270
You can still come out of
all of this in triumph.

00:54:37.040 --> 00:54:41.460
OBY EZEKWESILI: My
first thing would

00:54:41.460 --> 00:54:48.940
be that the flip side of
every crisis situation

00:54:48.940 --> 00:54:55.720
is an opportunity
waiting to be harnessed.

00:54:55.720 --> 00:55:01.530
And so if there is anything
that a young person should

00:55:01.530 --> 00:55:03.810
be thinking about
right now, that

00:55:03.810 --> 00:55:08.110
would be what are the problems
that this particular moment

00:55:08.110 --> 00:55:11.730
requires people to be solving?

00:55:11.730 --> 00:55:16.230
What are the problems that
go with a time like this?

00:55:16.230 --> 00:55:19.020
Because if I can
identify those problems,

00:55:19.020 --> 00:55:22.720
and I can figure out the
solutions to those problems,

00:55:22.720 --> 00:55:26.220
I actually stand a chance of
not just solving problems,

00:55:26.220 --> 00:55:29.530
but having to a living.

00:55:29.530 --> 00:55:33.410
So if it is basically about
people trying to figure out

00:55:33.410 --> 00:55:35.510
what they can do
for a living, that

00:55:35.510 --> 00:55:37.460
would be a good
way to think of it.

00:55:37.460 --> 00:55:41.400
Because in crisis situation,
existing solutions

00:55:41.400 --> 00:55:42.230
no longer work.

00:55:42.230 --> 00:55:42.920
Right?

00:55:42.920 --> 00:55:48.210
Because existing solutions were
OK for a different context.

00:55:48.210 --> 00:55:49.200
You know?

00:55:49.200 --> 00:55:52.770
So thinking of it that
way just sort of makes

00:55:52.770 --> 00:55:55.980
you an entrepreneur.

00:55:55.980 --> 00:55:58.560
And then the
entrepreneurial mindset

00:55:58.560 --> 00:56:01.480
is the mindset of
the problem solver.

00:56:01.480 --> 00:56:04.750
And so you've got to
think of it that way.

00:56:04.750 --> 00:56:08.330
Because then it
unburdens you from saying

00:56:08.330 --> 00:56:10.566
we're all in trouble.

00:56:10.566 --> 00:56:12.690
You can distinguish yourself.

00:56:12.690 --> 00:56:16.810
I can identify the various
problems or the different sets

00:56:16.810 --> 00:56:18.285
of segments of society.

00:56:18.285 --> 00:56:19.410
And this what I can solve--

00:56:19.410 --> 00:56:20.070
JULIET EHUMIAN-CHIAZOR: And the
opportunities that it creates.

00:56:20.070 --> 00:56:22.111
OBY EZEKWESILI: --and
these are the opportunities

00:56:22.111 --> 00:56:22.940
that are created.

00:56:22.940 --> 00:56:28.660
Then the second thing has to be
if I am in a changing context,

00:56:28.660 --> 00:56:33.880
then I need to be thinking,
am I equipped for this change?

00:56:33.880 --> 00:56:35.770
Am I equipped to handle it?

00:56:35.770 --> 00:56:38.930
You know, because as
circumstances change,

00:56:38.930 --> 00:56:44.890
the skills with which you're
going to have to deal with,

00:56:44.890 --> 00:56:48.750
the changing context
would have to change also.

00:56:48.750 --> 00:56:52.810
But if you still stuck
in person that you've

00:56:52.810 --> 00:56:56.982
been, in the expectations
that you've had,

00:56:56.982 --> 00:57:01.620
in the possibilities that you
can see, they you're stuck.

00:57:01.620 --> 00:57:04.330
You know, it's a dangerous
place to be stuck,

00:57:04.330 --> 00:57:07.050
just knowing what
you knew yesterday.

00:57:07.050 --> 00:57:09.140
Yesterday is gone, people.

00:57:09.140 --> 00:57:11.380
Today is new.

00:57:11.380 --> 00:57:13.120
JULIET EHUMIAN-CHIAZOR:
Needs new ideas.

00:57:13.120 --> 00:57:15.604
OBY EZEKWESILI: And every
new day requires new skills--

00:57:15.604 --> 00:57:17.020
JULIET EHUMIAN-CHIAZOR:
New ideas.

00:57:17.020 --> 00:57:21.250
OBY EZEKWESILI: New thoughts,
new ideas, new ways,

00:57:21.250 --> 00:57:25.720
new partnerships, new
orientations, new attitudes.

00:57:25.720 --> 00:57:33.910
And then a number three would
be to actually reach out.

00:57:33.910 --> 00:57:35.680
Reach out.

00:57:35.680 --> 00:57:39.310
It's a threat to be too
small in a world that

00:57:39.310 --> 00:57:41.110
is more and more global.

00:57:41.110 --> 00:57:41.610
OK?

00:57:41.610 --> 00:57:44.390
So you must reach out.

00:57:44.390 --> 00:57:48.120
I see some of the brilliance
of the generation,

00:57:48.120 --> 00:57:49.940
your generation.

00:57:49.940 --> 00:57:52.050
I see the brilliance.

00:57:52.050 --> 00:57:58.570
But I also see a certain
amount of self adulation,

00:57:58.570 --> 00:58:04.340
and a sense of
dysfunctional individualism.

00:58:04.340 --> 00:58:08.535
So people just love
the idea that it's

00:58:08.535 --> 00:58:13.600
I am the champion who is doing
this thing, all by myself.

00:58:13.600 --> 00:58:16.352
No, today's world is a world
of collaborative partnerships.

00:58:16.352 --> 00:58:18.560
JULIET EHUMIAN-CHIAZOR: TY,
what's your take on that?

00:58:18.560 --> 00:58:20.360
TY BELLO: I'd like
to add to that.

00:58:20.360 --> 00:58:23.570
This is the age of social media.

00:58:23.570 --> 00:58:26.160
And social media
means communication

00:58:26.160 --> 00:58:27.923
and conversations.

00:58:27.923 --> 00:58:30.200
And I find that
there is a deception

00:58:30.200 --> 00:58:32.490
to think that it's
just a conversation,

00:58:32.490 --> 00:58:34.550
and it's not real.

00:58:34.550 --> 00:58:37.230
So we don't realize
that we are actually

00:58:37.230 --> 00:58:42.741
part of the conversation,
and that we actually

00:58:42.741 --> 00:58:43.490
make a difference.

00:58:43.490 --> 00:58:44.994
I mean, it sounds very blase.

00:58:44.994 --> 00:58:46.160
Like, you make a difference.

00:58:46.160 --> 00:58:48.040
But it's not just speaking.

00:58:48.040 --> 00:58:50.920
It's deciding what your
posture is concerning

00:58:50.920 --> 00:58:53.030
the problem that exists.

00:58:53.030 --> 00:58:56.340
And the fact that you
may not be able to prefer

00:58:56.340 --> 00:58:59.580
a general solution
to everything.

00:58:59.580 --> 00:59:02.400
But you have a
solution for something.

00:59:02.400 --> 00:59:05.490
One of my biggest
mantras is do for one

00:59:05.490 --> 00:59:07.230
what you would do for all.

00:59:07.230 --> 00:59:11.160
And letting people realize that,
that solution that you have,

00:59:11.160 --> 00:59:13.712
that can help your
neighbor, the fact

00:59:13.712 --> 00:59:15.670
that you can share
generator with your neighbor

00:59:15.670 --> 00:59:16.924
to help him save costs.

00:59:16.924 --> 00:59:17.840
Do you not understand?

00:59:17.840 --> 00:59:21.230
Just that little tiny
solution goes a long way

00:59:21.230 --> 00:59:24.250
in you actually being
part of a conversation

00:59:24.250 --> 00:59:27.660
than tweeting at other
people and criticizing them,

00:59:27.660 --> 00:59:29.860
and telling them what
to do and how to do,

00:59:29.860 --> 00:59:33.550
is within your own parameter,
within your own boundaries.

00:59:33.550 --> 00:59:35.540
What changes can you make?

00:59:35.540 --> 00:59:37.485
And then starting
with that, I think.

00:59:37.485 --> 00:59:38.880
I think it's a small idea.

00:59:38.880 --> 00:59:40.680
But I think it'll go very far.

00:59:40.680 --> 00:59:41.970
[APPLAUSE]

00:59:41.970 --> 00:59:44.050
JULIET EHUMIAN-CHIAZOR:
Thank you so much.

00:59:44.050 --> 00:59:46.240
OBY EZEKWESILI: But let
me have a final word

00:59:46.240 --> 00:59:51.020
and say to the women that are
here, and that are listening,

00:59:51.020 --> 00:59:53.690
the pressure on the
younger generation

00:59:53.690 --> 01:00:00.660
of women professionals is much
more than we even coped with.

01:00:00.660 --> 01:00:03.780
It's a world that is
much more fast paced.

01:00:03.780 --> 01:00:09.570
And the kind of expectations
that are placed on you

01:00:09.570 --> 01:00:13.050
are more varied.

01:00:13.050 --> 01:00:16.330
As a woman, one
tool that I use is

01:00:16.330 --> 01:00:18.740
what I call my five realities.

01:00:18.740 --> 01:00:22.090
My five realities
are these-- number

01:00:22.090 --> 01:00:25.470
one reality is my
reality as a human being.

01:00:25.470 --> 01:00:27.790
It is in that reality,
as a human being,

01:00:27.790 --> 01:00:32.930
that I have been given that
talent by the Almighty.

01:00:32.930 --> 01:00:35.030
That talent is unique to me.

01:00:35.030 --> 01:00:38.570
It's my authentic personality.

01:00:38.570 --> 01:00:42.220
And it is the gift that
I have, that education

01:00:42.220 --> 01:00:43.560
would have enhanced.

01:00:43.560 --> 01:00:47.750
And so in that, my reality
as a unique individual,

01:00:47.750 --> 01:00:50.680
I can be anything
that I choose to be.

01:00:50.680 --> 01:00:52.440
I can be a photographer.

01:00:52.440 --> 01:00:54.620
I can be a Google manager.

01:00:54.620 --> 01:00:57.770
I can be a radio station owner.

01:00:57.770 --> 01:00:59.170
I can be a lawyer.

01:00:59.170 --> 01:00:59.920
I can be a doctor.

01:00:59.920 --> 01:01:01.260
I can be a teacher.

01:01:01.260 --> 01:01:04.740
I can be anything
that I choose to be.

01:01:04.740 --> 01:01:10.380
And what I need is to find
what would enable maybe that.

01:01:10.380 --> 01:01:14.250
And if there be any glass
ceiling standing between me

01:01:14.250 --> 01:01:16.080
and what I can
be, I'm just going

01:01:16.080 --> 01:01:17.720
to walk through that glass.

01:01:17.720 --> 01:01:20.590
Your second reality,
my second reality,

01:01:20.590 --> 01:01:25.690
my reality as the product of
two people, a mom and a dad,

01:01:25.690 --> 01:01:28.890
they give me the
history that is mine.

01:01:28.890 --> 01:01:32.230
There would not be me
if a certain Benjamin

01:01:32.230 --> 01:01:35.120
and a certain Cecelia
did not come together.

01:01:35.120 --> 01:01:39.450
If I neglect that, my
reality, I lose my history.

01:01:39.450 --> 01:01:41.490
I lose everything
that is supposed

01:01:41.490 --> 01:01:45.210
to enable me to understand
where I have come from.

01:01:45.210 --> 01:01:48.110
So my reality as a
daughter is very important.

01:01:48.110 --> 01:01:51.830
My reality as a daughter
is what enables me to not

01:01:51.830 --> 01:01:54.910
repeat the mistakes
that my mother made,

01:01:54.910 --> 01:01:57.780
or to repeat the mistakes
that my dad made.

01:01:57.780 --> 01:02:01.440
Then my third reality is
my reality as a sibling.

01:02:04.280 --> 01:02:07.610
Even if I didn't have
brothers and sisters,

01:02:07.610 --> 01:02:09.070
I must have had cousins.

01:02:09.070 --> 01:02:11.685
Because this is
Africa, after all.

01:02:11.685 --> 01:02:15.940
So that reality enables
my socialization.

01:02:15.940 --> 01:02:20.890
My reality as a sibling means
that I am a sister to a brother

01:02:20.890 --> 01:02:23.260
or to a sister, or to cousins.

01:02:23.260 --> 01:02:24.640
Now, what do they do for me?

01:02:24.640 --> 01:02:27.280
They teach me how to lead.

01:02:27.280 --> 01:02:30.210
Because in the early
days, of my growing

01:02:30.210 --> 01:02:35.550
up as a sister to brothers
and to a sister, what happened

01:02:35.550 --> 01:02:39.220
was that I needed to be
able to persuade them

01:02:39.220 --> 01:02:42.910
that it was right for us
to do this or to do that.

01:02:42.910 --> 01:02:45.420
If I didn't persuade
them, I didn't

01:02:45.420 --> 01:02:49.030
get people who followed me
to do any particular thing.

01:02:49.030 --> 01:02:54.235
I learned persuasion
by being a sister.

01:02:54.235 --> 01:03:00.430
Learned leadership by being able
to convince them to follow me.

01:03:00.430 --> 01:03:04.430
Then your fourth reality is
likely to be your reality

01:03:04.430 --> 01:03:05.770
as a wife.

01:03:05.770 --> 01:03:08.520
The companion of
this wonderful man

01:03:08.520 --> 01:03:11.602
that you decided, of all men,
that you are going to marry.

01:03:11.602 --> 01:03:15.320
I mean, that's some
incredible reality.

01:03:15.320 --> 01:03:16.690
Its partnership.

01:03:16.690 --> 01:03:19.310
Marriage teaches
you partnership.

01:03:19.310 --> 01:03:23.240
It teaches you how to not live
for yourself alone, to learn

01:03:23.240 --> 01:03:27.420
how to live for somebody
else, to sacrifice, to get

01:03:27.420 --> 01:03:31.570
to the point of intimacy
that marriage is about.

01:03:31.570 --> 01:03:36.690
Then your final possible
reality is the reality as a mom.

01:03:36.690 --> 01:03:40.250
The reality as a mom is an
entirely different experience.

01:03:40.250 --> 01:03:44.100
It's this experience
where you're preparing

01:03:44.100 --> 01:03:46.140
the world for the future.

01:03:46.140 --> 01:03:49.320
That future that you're
preparing the world for

01:03:49.320 --> 01:03:54.660
is going to be defined by
what you deposit in the twins.

01:03:54.660 --> 01:03:57.520
The world is waiting for the
twins on the business of what

01:03:57.520 --> 01:03:59.190
you do with them today.

01:03:59.190 --> 01:04:04.430
You're going to unleash either
great children of stature

01:04:04.430 --> 01:04:08.330
on society, or they are
going to be terrorists.

01:04:08.330 --> 01:04:11.320
Which one should you
unleash on the world?

01:04:11.320 --> 01:04:12.940
It's a reality.

01:04:12.940 --> 01:04:18.260
So being a mom, being able
to invest in the children,

01:04:18.260 --> 01:04:19.550
so important.

01:04:19.550 --> 01:04:20.660
Your reality.

01:04:20.660 --> 01:04:22.582
Now, with all these
five realities,

01:04:22.582 --> 01:04:25.540
how do I manage to
cope as a woman?

01:04:25.540 --> 01:04:28.350
Is your question
to yourself, right?

01:04:28.350 --> 01:04:33.670
You're going to say, ah, there's
not a single of my reality

01:04:33.670 --> 01:04:41.134
that should be traded
off for the other.

01:04:41.134 --> 01:04:42.550
JULIET EHUMIAN
CHIAZOR: Balancing.

01:04:42.550 --> 01:04:43.883
OBY EZEKWESILI: Do you know why?

01:04:43.883 --> 01:04:50.780
Because the capacity to express
all your realities already

01:04:50.780 --> 01:04:52.360
in you.

01:04:52.360 --> 01:04:54.940
So because they are
in you, what you

01:04:54.940 --> 01:04:58.210
need is to be able
to say to yourself,

01:04:58.210 --> 01:05:02.520
how do I keep expanding
and expanding?

01:05:02.520 --> 01:05:06.600
And then there are days when
one particular reality is going

01:05:06.600 --> 01:05:08.770
ahead of the other realities.

01:05:08.770 --> 01:05:11.740
And you say to yourself,
I have observed

01:05:11.740 --> 01:05:14.270
that this reality is suffering.

01:05:14.270 --> 01:05:16.510
Let us recalibrate a bit.

01:05:16.510 --> 01:05:19.900
So you're constantly
recalibrating,

01:05:19.900 --> 01:05:24.950
but ensuring that no
reality gets forgotten.

01:05:24.950 --> 01:05:28.400
Don't ever forget being a
wife, just because you want

01:05:28.400 --> 01:05:31.780
to be the best radio owner.

01:05:31.780 --> 01:05:34.640
Don't forget being
a great mother

01:05:34.640 --> 01:05:39.100
just because you want to be TY
Bello, the global photographer.

01:05:39.100 --> 01:05:41.220
Don't forget being
a daughter just

01:05:41.220 --> 01:05:43.680
because you have
become a wonderful wife

01:05:43.680 --> 01:05:45.140
enjoying your husband.

01:05:45.140 --> 01:05:49.550
There has to be a way
that the Divine that's

01:05:49.550 --> 01:05:53.007
given us all of
this, inside of us,

01:05:53.007 --> 01:05:54.840
can help us to sort of
hold it all together.

01:05:54.840 --> 01:05:55.890
JULIET EHUMIAN-CHIAZOR:
Hold it all together.

01:05:55.890 --> 01:05:56.681
TY BELLO: Together.

01:05:56.681 --> 01:05:58.390
[APPLAUSE]

01:06:01.922 --> 01:06:04.380
JULIET EHUMIAN-CHIAZOR: I think
that's a very powerful note

01:06:04.380 --> 01:06:05.740
on which to wrap up.

01:06:05.740 --> 01:06:07.807
A big thank you
to Oby Ezekwesili.

01:06:07.807 --> 01:06:08.640
OBY EZEKWESILI: Yes.

01:06:08.640 --> 01:06:10.640
[APPLAUSE]

01:06:11.724 --> 01:06:13.140
JULIET EHUMIAN-CHIAZOR:
Thank you.

01:06:13.140 --> 01:06:15.380
You've committed this day to us.

01:06:15.380 --> 01:06:17.764
You have been on this for--
I do, I am very grateful.

01:06:17.764 --> 01:06:18.930
OBY EZEKWESILI: [INAUDIBLE].

01:06:21.450 --> 01:06:23.750
JULIET EHUMIAN-CHIAZOR:
I owe you one.

01:06:23.750 --> 01:06:25.500
OBY EZEKWESILI: Let
me reveal your secret.

01:06:25.500 --> 01:06:28.090
I told her on [INAUDIBLE],
let me go back.

01:06:28.090 --> 01:06:32.105
This flight, the amount
of delay that they

01:06:32.105 --> 01:06:34.010
say they have is too much.

01:06:34.010 --> 01:06:38.000
It's going to be so unproductive
for me to sit at the airport.

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:39.080
So let me go home.

01:06:39.080 --> 01:06:41.600
And I was hoping that
she was going to say, oh

01:06:41.600 --> 01:06:43.760
actually, that's not bad.

01:06:43.760 --> 01:06:45.380
She said, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

01:06:45.380 --> 01:06:46.760
Please don't go home.

01:06:46.760 --> 01:06:49.094
I think you should just
wait at the airport.

01:06:49.094 --> 01:06:51.260
JULIET EHUMIAN-CHIAZOR: Are
you guys not glad I did?

01:06:51.260 --> 01:06:51.707
TY BELLO: Yes.

01:06:51.707 --> 01:06:52.154
OBY EZEKWESILI: Yes.

01:06:52.154 --> 01:06:52.601
JULIET EHUMIAN-CHIAZOR: Aha!

01:06:52.601 --> 01:06:53.495
[LAUGHTER]

01:06:53.495 --> 01:06:55.290
[APPLAUSE]

01:06:55.290 --> 01:06:56.700
So thank you very much.

01:06:56.700 --> 01:06:57.797
And thank you, TY Bello.

01:06:57.797 --> 01:06:58.630
TY BELLO: Thank you.

01:06:58.630 --> 01:06:58.810
Want

01:06:58.810 --> 01:06:59.500
JULIET EHUMIAN CHIAZOR:
You've also been with us

01:06:59.500 --> 01:07:00.800
for quite a few hours now.

01:07:00.800 --> 01:07:01.300
TY BELLO: Thank you.

01:07:01.300 --> 01:07:03.216
JULIET EHUMIAN-CHIAZOR:
Through both sessions.

01:07:03.216 --> 01:07:04.800
[APPLAUSE]

01:07:05.930 --> 01:07:08.562
Thank you for your leadership,
for your inspiration.

01:07:08.562 --> 01:07:09.395
TY BELLO: Thank you.

01:07:09.395 --> 01:07:10.000
JULIET EHUMIAN-CHIAZOR:
And thank you

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:11.440
for spending this time with us.

01:07:11.440 --> 01:07:11.990
OBY EZEKWESILI: Thank you.

01:07:11.990 --> 01:07:13.531
JULIET EHUMIAN-CHIAZOR:
And thank you

01:07:13.531 --> 01:07:16.340
everyone that has
shared this day with us.

01:07:16.340 --> 01:07:19.430
We look forward to
continuing the conversation

01:07:19.430 --> 01:07:25.090
around women really stepping up
and standing out and breaking,

01:07:25.090 --> 01:07:27.266
smashing the glass
ceiling, if there is one.

01:07:27.266 --> 01:07:28.099
OBY EZEKWESILI: Yes.

01:07:28.099 --> 01:07:30.395
You've got to kick it!

01:07:30.395 --> 01:07:32.520
JULIET EHUMIAN-CHIAZOR:
Great, thank you very much.

01:07:32.520 --> 01:07:34.370
OBY EZEKWESILI: Thank you.
