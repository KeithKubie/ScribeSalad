00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:10.164
Sometimes when a fish 
is reeled up to the surface

00:00:10.164 --> 00:00:12.160
it will appear inflated,

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.222
with its eyes bulging out of their sockets

00:00:14.222 --> 00:00:16.622
and its stomach 
projecting out of its mouth,

00:00:16.622 --> 00:00:19.289
as if its been blown up like a balloon.

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.893
This type of bodily damage,
caused by rapid changes in pressure,

00:00:22.893 --> 00:00:25.433
is called barotrauma.

00:00:25.433 --> 00:00:30.350
Under the sea, pressure increases
by 14.7 pounds per square inch

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:33.848
for every 33 foot increase in depth.

00:00:33.848 --> 00:00:35.750
So, take the yelloweye rockfish,

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:38.926
which can live as deep as 1800 feet,

00:00:38.926 --> 00:00:43.423
where there's over 800 pounds of pressure
on every square inch.

00:00:43.423 --> 00:00:47.854
That's equivalent to the weight of a
polar bear balancing on a quarter.

00:00:47.854 --> 00:00:50.106
Now, Boyle's gas law states

00:00:50.106 --> 00:00:54.416
that the volume of a gas
is inversely related to pressure.

00:00:54.416 --> 00:00:58.366
So, any air-filled spaces,
like a rockfish's swim bladder,

00:00:58.366 --> 00:01:00.165
or human lungs,

00:01:00.165 --> 00:01:02.469
will compress as they descend deeper

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:05.077
and expand as they ascend.

00:01:05.077 --> 00:01:09.377
After a fish bites a fisherman's hook
and is quickly reeled up to the surface,

00:01:09.377 --> 00:01:12.980
the air in its swim bladder 
begins to expand.

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:17.412
Its rapid expansion actually forces
the fish's stomach out of its mouth,

00:01:17.412 --> 00:01:22.481
while the increased internal pressure
pushes its eyes out of their sockets,

00:01:22.481 --> 00:01:25.403
a condition called exophthalmia.

00:01:25.403 --> 00:01:29.652
Sometimes rockfish eyes will even have
a crystallized appearance

00:01:29.652 --> 00:01:31.895
from corneal emphysemas,

00:01:31.895 --> 00:01:35.567
little gas bubbles 
that build up inside the cornea.

00:01:35.567 --> 00:01:40.505
Thankfully, a scuba diver doesn't have
a closed swim bladder to worry about.

00:01:40.505 --> 00:01:45.172
A diver can regulate pressure in her lungs
by breathing out as she ascends,

00:01:45.172 --> 00:01:49.472
but must be wary of other laws of physics
that are at play under the sea.

00:01:49.472 --> 00:01:53.429
Henry's law states that the amount 
of a gas that dissolves in a liquid

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:56.635
is proportional to its partial pressure.

00:01:56.635 --> 00:02:00.720
The air a diver breathes is 78% nitrogen.

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.521
At a higher pressure under the sea,

00:02:02.521 --> 00:02:04.957
the nitrogen from the air in a scuba tank

00:02:04.957 --> 00:02:10.907
diffuses into a diver's tissues in greater
concentrations than it would on land.

00:02:10.907 --> 00:02:13.245
If the diver ascends too quickly,

00:02:13.245 --> 00:02:16.434
this built up nitrogen 
can come out of solution

00:02:16.434 --> 00:02:20.326
and form microbubbles in her tissues,
blood and joints,

00:02:20.326 --> 00:02:24.491
causing decompression sickness,
aka the bends.

00:02:24.491 --> 00:02:28.921
This is similar to the fizz 
of carbon dioxide coming out of your soda.

00:02:28.921 --> 00:02:32.172
Gas comes out of solution 
when the pressure's released.

00:02:32.172 --> 00:02:34.872
But for a diver, the bubbles
cause severe pain

00:02:34.872 --> 00:02:37.184
and sometimes even death.

00:02:37.184 --> 00:02:40.519
Divers avoid falling victim to the bends
by rising slowly

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:45.311
and taking breaks along the way,
called decompression stops,

00:02:45.311 --> 00:02:48.296
so the gas has time to diffuse 
back out of their tissues

00:02:48.296 --> 00:02:51.026
and to be released through their breath.

00:02:51.026 --> 00:02:53.022
Just as a diver needs decompression,

00:02:53.022 --> 00:02:56.427
for a fish to recover, 
it needs recompression,

00:02:56.427 --> 00:02:59.509
which can be accomplished 
by putting it back in the sea.

00:02:59.509 --> 00:03:02.982
But that doesn't mean that fish
should just be tossed overboard.

00:03:02.982 --> 00:03:04.809
An inflated body will float

00:03:04.809 --> 00:03:09.196
and get scooped up by a hungry sea lion
or pecked at by seagulls.

00:03:09.196 --> 00:03:10.495
There's a common myth

00:03:10.495 --> 00:03:14.384
that piercing its stomach 
with a needle will let air escape,

00:03:14.384 --> 00:03:17.023
allowing the fish to swim 
back down on its own.

00:03:17.023 --> 00:03:19.910
But that is one balloon
that shouldn't be popped.

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:22.449
To return a fish properly to its habitat,

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:25.213
fisherman can use 
a descending device instead

00:03:25.213 --> 00:03:29.902
to lower it on a fishing line
and release it at the right depth.

00:03:29.902 --> 00:03:32.922
As it heads home and recompression
reduces gas volume,

00:03:32.922 --> 00:03:35.652
its eyes can return 
to their sockets and heal,

00:03:35.652 --> 00:03:38.965
and its stomach can move back into place.

00:03:38.965 --> 00:03:41.153
This fish will live to see another day,

00:03:41.153 --> 00:03:46.926
once more free to swim, eat, reproduce
and replenish the population.
