00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:11.150
IIt's fair to say that in the world of animated
films, Disney and Pixar will always be the

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:13.580
dream jobs of most animators and storytellers.

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:17.070
And once they get there, the men and women
of the studio are eager to show their love

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.770
for older films, or new ones still under development.

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:20.830
The easiest way?

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:24.770
By planting clues, Easter eggs, and secret
shout-outs within their very own movies.

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:33.630
Here are Screen Rant's 10 Hidden Messages
in Disney Movies.

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.300
Aladdin
Pixar's CG movies and shared universe may

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.730
be a modern invention, but Disney films giving
nods to their colleagues is nothing new.

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:44.250
When Aladdin helped Disney climb back to the
top of the animated world, it made sure to

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.580
give some credit to one of Disney's greats.

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:50.370
When the Sultan is stacking his toys out of
boredom, make sure you catch the plush version

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:58.990
of the Beast from Beauty and The Beast, not
even hidden in the stack.

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:02.350
Big Hero 6&nbsp;
The policeman scene in this Disney movie is

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:06.370
jampacked with easter eggs and references,
connecting it to everything from Frozen to

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:12.909
Bolt.

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:17.350
But the name of the police officer is a message
in itself: Sergeant Gerson, as in the late

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:22.020
Daniel Gerson, the writer of the film along
with Monster, Inc. and Monsters University,

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:28.890
injected into the CG world as a joke most
viewers won't even catch.

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.889
Brother Bear
It may not have been as warmly received as

00:01:31.889 --> 00:01:35.210
some of the Disney movies that preceded or
followed it, but Brother Bear made sure to

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.560
offer some credit to the movie released by
Pixar in the same year.

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.639
When the movie's human stars are fishing,
just a single frame or two shows that Nemo,

00:01:42.639 --> 00:01:50.890
the missing clownfish is visible in their
net, before a mammoth helps him make his escape.

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:54.340
Lilo and Stitch
There isn't much in common between the story

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:58.159
of a visiting alien creature and a Chinese
daughter pretending to be a boy in order to

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:02.490
defend her family, but the makers of Lilo
&amp; Stitch were clearly fans of Disney's Mulan

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:03.490
anyway.

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:07.729
A playful reference is made by the restaurant
Mulan Wok in town, but made blatantly clear

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:12.280
when Lilo's sister Nani is shown to have a
poster for the movie in her bedroom.

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:15.640
Disney women gotta stick together.

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.330
Princess and The Frog
Although it's one of the few Disney princess

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:22.470
stories set in America, the ties are strongest
between the Princess and the Frog and Disney's

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:23.470
Aladdin.

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:27.610
Not only has Genie's lamp made it all the
way to North America, but even Aladdin's trusty

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:31.250
flying carpet can be seen in the background
of one wide shot of New Orleans.

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:34.810
But it wasn't just past easter eggs included
in the Louisiana adventure, but a hint of

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:35.850
what was to come.

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:41.510
You'll have to look closely, and you'll catch
a copy of Rapunzel on Tiana's bookshelf.

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:44.670
Before the title was changed to Tangled, Disney
was set to release their follow-up with that

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:45.670
same name.

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:48.810
Clearly, the animators never got the message.

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:51.460
Robin Hood
Disney's Robin hood remains something special

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:54.480
for its world populated only by human-like
animals.

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:59.620
But the love story at its heart is the exact
same as any other.

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:03.090
Which is probably why the carriage that Robin
and Marian ride off in at the film's conclusion

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:06.960
is the exact same one that took Cinderella
and Prince Charming away after their wedding.

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:14.140
A subtle sign that people or animals, it was
true love, through and through.

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:16.560
Cars
The world of Cars is filled to the brim with

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:20.810
inside jokes, tongue in cheek car puns, and
references to nearly every other Pixar movie

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:21.810
ever made.

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:26.361
But the number of star Lightning McQueen - 95
- is a reference to the studio itself, with

00:03:26.361 --> 00:03:30.780
Toy Story releasing in 1995, making them household
names overnight.

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:34.230
The same number even makes an appearance in
Toy Story 2 on the front of the train in the

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:40.230
opening sequence.

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:43.440
Wreck-it Ralph
Few expected Disney to turn their story of

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:48.230
a video game villain turned hero into a critical
and commercial success, but just as much credit

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:52.010
was earned by Paperman, the short film which
preceded it in theaters.

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:56.180
It earned Disney its first animated short
Oscar since 1970, but fans may still miss

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:58.010
the easter egg in the movie itself.

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:01.330
Take a close look at the bulletin board of
the Bad-Anon meeting, and you'll spot the

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:06.980
exact piece of paper from the short - red
lipstick and all.

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:10.640
Tangled
Nobody, and we mean nobody, expected Disney's

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:14.760
Tangled to become one of the studio's biggest
hits, kicking off a second renaissance of

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:16.590
digitally-animated Disney films.

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:20.880
Luckily, some of Disney's most beloved mascots
were able to see the movie up close.

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:24.740
During the angellic musical number at the
Snuggle Duckling, keep an eye peeled for both

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:29.410
Pinocchio observing the action from the rafters,
and even a warthog mixed in with the crowd.

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:33.620
When you see a warthog in a Disney film, it's
a safe bet that it's one more animator paying

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:38.030
credit to the flatulent hog... even if Timon
is nowhere to be seen.

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:41.530
Those are just a few of the clever easter
eggs, homages, and hidden jokes snuck into

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:44.350
Disney's biggest hits, but which ones are
your favorite to spot?
