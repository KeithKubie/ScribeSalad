00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:06.006
People are so accustomed
to making a direct parallel

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:09.843
between a photograph's subject
and its meaning.

00:00:10.553 --> 00:00:14.806
The thing that it depicts
is rarely the same scale,

00:00:14.973 --> 00:00:16.516
the same dimensionality,

00:00:16.683 --> 00:00:19.653
the same color
as the photograph itself,

00:00:19.811 --> 00:00:22.070
and it's in those differences

00:00:22.231 --> 00:00:25.276
that a real tension
and interest lies.

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:32.200
Since photography was invented,

00:00:32.616 --> 00:00:35.411
one of the functions
that it's served in the world

00:00:35.953 --> 00:00:39.873
is to record things that would
have previously been recorded

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.751
through drawing,
or etching, or sketching.

00:00:43.085 --> 00:00:47.006
That notion of a photograph's
documentary function

00:00:47.173 --> 00:00:49.591
has been a part of it
since the beginning.

00:00:50.218 --> 00:00:54.096
When John Szarkowski
organized New Documents in 1967,

00:00:54.263 --> 00:00:56.891
what he was doing
was drawing together

00:00:57.183 --> 00:01:01.871
three of the best
and most promising suggestions

00:01:02.038 --> 00:01:03.981
in contemporary photography.

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:05.640
They weren't trying
to change the world.

00:01:05.775 --> 00:01:07.651
They weren't trying
to work for a client.

00:01:07.901 --> 00:01:09.570
They weren't trying
to make a picture

00:01:09.903 --> 00:01:13.323
that served any other purpose
than making that picture.

00:01:14.283 --> 00:01:17.370
For a photograph
to function as a document

00:01:17.536 --> 00:01:18.913
in the traditional sense of the word,

00:01:19.246 --> 00:01:22.375
it had to be clear,
it had to be sharp, in focus.

00:01:22.625 --> 00:01:26.420
But what is interesting about Arbus
and Winogrand and Friedlander

00:01:26.586 --> 00:01:30.266
is that they would adopt
that language of handheld,

00:01:30.433 --> 00:01:32.051
black-and-white photography,

00:01:32.385 --> 00:01:36.638
but what they were applying it to
was a totally personal end.

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:45.398
This picture by Garry Winogrand
came into the collection in 1973.

00:01:45.981 --> 00:01:49.610
It's a classic
mid-to-late 20th century print.

00:01:49.776 --> 00:01:51.653
It's made
from a 35 millimeter negative

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:55.866
that he's enlarged to this scale,
printed on gelatin silver paper,

00:01:56.283 --> 00:01:57.993
and then trimmed and mounted it.

00:01:59.245 --> 00:02:02.873
When you think
of Gary Winogrand's photograph

00:02:03.081 --> 00:02:06.665
of the blonde woman
and the African-American man

00:02:06.831 --> 00:02:08.838
carrying two monkeys,

00:02:09.296 --> 00:02:11.173
of course,
that is a photograph

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.218
of a couple and their two
very well-dressed monkeys

00:02:14.468 --> 00:02:15.761
walking through Central Park.

00:02:16.136 --> 00:02:19.890
But when you realize
what Winogrand has done,

00:02:20.183 --> 00:02:22.976
and his recognition of how
that picture can function

00:02:23.143 --> 00:02:26.438
both as a metaphor
and as a subject,

00:02:26.771 --> 00:02:29.525
the choices that he's made
in terms of how close he stands

00:02:29.691 --> 00:02:31.511
to that subject or how far away,

00:02:31.861 --> 00:02:34.988
how the very nature
of walking around the streets

00:02:35.448 --> 00:02:37.491
with a 35-millimeter camera

00:02:37.825 --> 00:02:41.283
opens the possibility of encountering
something like that on the street,

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:44.123
and just capturing it
as it's passing you by.

00:02:45.583 --> 00:02:47.251
All photographers make choices,

00:02:47.418 --> 00:02:49.920
whether it's how you frame
something on Instagram,

00:02:50.086 --> 00:02:52.881
what kind of camera you use,
what kind of prints you make,

00:02:53.048 --> 00:02:54.656
how you share that picture.

00:02:54.823 --> 00:02:57.761
All of those choices
make every photograph different

00:02:57.928 --> 00:02:59.680
from what it's a photograph of,

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:03.726
and help you tease apart
the difference and the space

00:03:03.893 --> 00:03:06.561
between something
in front of the camera

00:03:07.021 --> 00:03:09.231
and the ultimate production
of the artist.
