[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.035 --> 00:00:08.160
SLAVA VAKARCHUK: The things
I will be talking about

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.070
probably are not very
usual to hear from me now.

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:15.620
Because usually I have
meetings with people

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:21.410
and talk about civil
society, about culture,

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:24.620
about political
things in my country--

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:27.980
But I decided when I
was asked to talk here,

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:30.050
to choose something
different and to talk

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:33.350
about history, science,
technology, everything

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:35.390
together.

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:38.450
I started this sort
of presentation--

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:40.100
I started thinking about that--

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:44.780
during my semester at Yale
University two years ago.

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:46.170
One year and a half ago.

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.210
So at one of the
seminars I proposed

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.110
the idea of 20 inventions
that changed the world.

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:52.880
And it was somehow popular.

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:54.530
We had a big
argument after that.

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:57.460
So I thought it out afterwards.

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:58.940
I added some stuff.

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:04.879
So now I'll try to talk about
these 20 inventions that

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:06.240
changed the world--

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.480
and as they say, that
pushed boundaries--

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:10.160
It's not only innovations.

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:13.280
It's just some of
them are innovations.

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:14.750
Some of them are discoveries.

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:18.860
Some of them are just
inventions by chance, you know.

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:21.200
Or as [? Dima ?]
says, by accident.

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.310
Some good things are happening
by accident, somehow.

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:36.210
And some of them are probably
will be argued by your audience

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.960
and can be--

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.630
let's find a
compromise at the end.

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.000
So I'm very, very happy
that you are here.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.500
I know that this is a
very intelligent audience.

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:48.690
And I will be very short.

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:50.730
Probably 20 to 25 minutes.

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:52.110
Or 30 minutes maximum.

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.720
And then probably you'll
ask me some questions

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:55.950
on what you've heard.

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.540
And then probably you
can ask me some questions

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:01.560
about everything.

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.560
I'm very, very much free
to answer everything.

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.300
And I'll be all ears.

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:08.940
So we'll start from
these 20 inventions.

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.960
One thing, it's a shame that
I don't have a PowerPoint

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.420
presentation, but you know
I really didn't have time

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.030
to try to make it.

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:18.780
Also I'm not very
strong in PowerPoint.

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.890
Always my PA, Anya does it
for me and we were on tour.

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:28.620
So all I have is a very,
very old school stuff.

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:34.980
And if you want to learn by
heart the things that I'll

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:41.060
tell you, or just put down
some things in your notebooks--

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.410
so it will be great.

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:45.680
So when we talk about
these inventions

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:51.350
and about innovations
that changed or created

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:54.800
what a human being
is now, I think

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:57.330
one should think out of the box.

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:03.170
So we're not going to talk about
just technological breakdowns,

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:07.940
or breakthroughs, or
technological revolutions.

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:09.920
Or just some devices.

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:12.440
Because many of us
when we talk about--

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:15.080
today, when we hear
about inventions,

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:20.400
we're thinking about laptops,
or computers, or smartphones,

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.360
or all electrical cattles--

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:24.540
name it.

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:29.560
But things are more interesting
and everything starts

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:30.850
from the very beginning--

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:34.510
In my point of view, probably
the biggest invention

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:37.930
that was made by a
human being, even

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:42.730
before we started to name
ourselves Homo sapiens,

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:45.940
was the invention of hot food.

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:50.710
Hot food is something
unique, because we

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:55.960
are the only animals in the
world that consume hot food.

00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:00.430
And as you probably know, hot
food is much easier to digest.

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:03.650
And when we started
actually eating--

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:05.650
I think it was
also by accident--

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:10.750
eating meat that was baked,
literally, in some charcoal--

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:15.140
or just, I don't
know how it happened.

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:21.279
But we started doing it,
and once we got more energy

00:04:21.279 --> 00:04:28.510
to save, and that energy
went to transform to sugar,

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:30.490
and that sugar
went to our brain.

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:35.410
And our brain started to
grow, and it increased.

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:37.750
And actually, hot food--

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:42.130
most scientists argue-- was
much more responsible for making

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:44.800
our brains bigger than
even that the fact

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:48.550
that we walk on two legs,
which is also very important.

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:50.770
But that's something
that we didn't create.

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:53.440
But this innovation
to eat hot food,

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:56.440
I think it started the
whole process of creating

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:58.450
of a human being today.

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:05.920
And from that it
allowed us to proceed.

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:12.880
The second, very serious
innovation, or invention,

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:16.370
is language.

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:22.690
A language-- not only language
like communication, but what

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:26.740
human beings, Homo sapiens,
were able to derive

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:27.760
from this language.

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:31.930
As you probably know, before
Homo sapiens ruled the world,

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:36.770
there were other Homos
who inhabited our world.

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:42.640
These were like
Neanderthals, Homo habilis,

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:46.000
or even there was Homo denisova.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.440
It was a special
species of homos

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:52.570
who were living in Siberia.

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:55.130
All of them don't exist anymore.

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:58.150
Human beings, Homo sapiens
conquered everything,

00:05:58.150 --> 00:05:59.550
rule the world.

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:02.170
Unfortunately, they
exterminated 80%

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:05.000
of all living
creatures in the world,

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.170
even before scientific and
industrial revolutions.

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:12.280
We did it, 20,000,
30,000 years ago.

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:20.940
So language, which human
beings, or Homo sapiens used,

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:24.610
differed from language as a
homos, or even animals used.

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:27.070
Animals can communicate.

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:29.740
For example, they can
say that there is danger.

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:33.220
There is water there.

00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:37.140
So some primitive things.

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:39.500
Neanderthals, they
also used hot food,

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:42.000
so their brains also
were bigger than animals.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.310
And some say that even bigger
than Homo sapiens' brains.

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:50.320
But their language was still
this kind of primitive,

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:51.670
and very straightforward.

00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:55.120
What Homo sapiens created
was an abstract thinking,

00:06:55.120 --> 00:07:02.530
and language that used notions
and ideas that actually do not

00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:03.590
exist.

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:05.230
So that was our strength.

00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:09.010
So we used language
to describe things

00:07:09.010 --> 00:07:11.140
that actually don't exist.

00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:13.030
There is one very,
very interesting book--

00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:14.090
you can read it.

00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:19.180
It says, I think, Homo
sapiens and something,

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:20.080
I don't remember.

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:22.510
At the end I will
give you a name

00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:24.700
because I just don't remember.

00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:25.930
They have a good fact there.

00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:30.880
That Neanderthals could
communicate in a way

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:34.240
that, there is a lion and
this lion is dangerous,

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:38.110
we should be aware
of it, and that's it.

00:07:38.110 --> 00:07:44.380
Dangerous lion, we fight him,
or we escape, or we hide.

00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:47.320
But what Homo sapiens
made, they went further.

00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:53.110
They created things like, lion
can be a symbol of our forest.

00:07:53.110 --> 00:07:56.290
Or lion, he's a
defender of our forest--

00:07:56.290 --> 00:08:00.400
which actually, from the point
of matter of fact, is bullshit.

00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:04.870
I mean, a lion cannot
be anybody but lion.

00:08:04.870 --> 00:08:07.450
But human beings,
somehow, created

00:08:07.450 --> 00:08:09.250
this kind of abstract thinking.

00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:12.520
And their language
allowed them to imagine

00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:13.930
things that don't exist.

00:08:13.930 --> 00:08:21.790
That consequently led
to myths and religion.

00:08:21.790 --> 00:08:25.600
And that actually made
possible to gather

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:27.409
large groups of people.

00:08:27.409 --> 00:08:29.200
Much more than hundreds
of people, but even

00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:31.270
thousands of people together.

00:08:31.270 --> 00:08:37.210
You cannot stick together just
because you live in some area.

00:08:37.210 --> 00:08:41.710
Because people lived
in small tribes--

00:08:41.710 --> 00:08:44.140
100, 200 people.

00:08:44.140 --> 00:08:47.590
But when you share the common
beliefs, or the common things--

00:08:47.590 --> 00:08:51.400
like for example, that a lion
is a master of the forest--

00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:55.810
it makes your bodies in the
other forest understandable.

00:08:55.810 --> 00:08:59.830
And you can communicate, and
then that makes strong bonds.

00:08:59.830 --> 00:09:03.850
And actually, this made
Homo sapiens so powerful.

00:09:03.850 --> 00:09:05.210
They could create tribes--

00:09:05.210 --> 00:09:07.750
not of hundreds of people,
but thousands of people.

00:09:07.750 --> 00:09:14.350
And that's how they literally
exterminated all their rivals.

00:09:14.350 --> 00:09:22.570
So that will be the second
fundamental invention, which is

00:09:22.570 --> 00:09:25.270
language and abstract thinking.

00:09:25.270 --> 00:09:27.940
The third is the
only one I didn't

00:09:27.940 --> 00:09:29.200
include in my previous list.

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:35.620
But in the argument
that we had afterwards,

00:09:35.620 --> 00:09:37.360
it came up to my
head that probably it

00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:41.050
was a very important one and I
should include into the list--

00:09:41.050 --> 00:09:42.790
its money.

00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:45.610
Because money actually
created interaction

00:09:45.610 --> 00:09:47.220
between all human beings.

00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:49.240
Continuous interaction.

00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:53.740
It's also a sort of myth
or a sort of religion.

00:09:53.740 --> 00:09:57.210
Because money is actually
an abstract thing.

00:09:57.210 --> 00:10:00.190
It doesn't exist
as we understand,

00:10:00.190 --> 00:10:02.470
because it's not
a material thing.

00:10:02.470 --> 00:10:06.340
But it created something
that all people believed in.

00:10:06.340 --> 00:10:08.610
And actually, probably,
it's the only religion

00:10:08.610 --> 00:10:12.910
that all seven or eight billion
people believe in today.

00:10:12.910 --> 00:10:16.510
And that's something that can--

00:10:16.510 --> 00:10:17.350
Look at that.

00:10:17.350 --> 00:10:25.480
You can argue about whether
Christianity or Islam,

00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:27.010
or some other
religions, are better.

00:10:27.010 --> 00:10:29.110
Or some people don't
believe in God.

00:10:29.110 --> 00:10:30.950
But nobody argues about money.

00:10:30.950 --> 00:10:33.580
I mean, it's very
hard to find somebody

00:10:33.580 --> 00:10:37.840
except Shaolin monks, who
just don't use money--

00:10:40.750 --> 00:10:42.850
Money changed everything.

00:10:42.850 --> 00:10:44.980
Money changed
behavior of people.

00:10:44.980 --> 00:10:47.080
And they made them more--

00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:51.400
When we say materialistic,
it's not only bad thing,

00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:55.980
it's something that
you become cautious.

00:10:55.980 --> 00:10:57.780
Money makes people cautious.

00:10:57.780 --> 00:10:59.880
And probably it
also preserved us

00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:03.150
from doing or making
some big mistakes

00:11:03.150 --> 00:11:04.860
at the beginning of our history.

00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:10.840
Also money are,
unfortunately, pushing

00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:13.300
us to make big, big
mistakes, huge mistakes,

00:11:13.300 --> 00:11:16.090
now in this part of our history.

00:11:16.090 --> 00:11:18.040
But anyway money
is number three.

00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:20.010
Number four is writing.

00:11:20.010 --> 00:11:23.170
And writing is
obvious invention,

00:11:23.170 --> 00:11:26.410
but many things
existed before writing.

00:11:26.410 --> 00:11:30.040
For example, oral
narratives allowed people

00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:32.260
to have, once again, religion.

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:35.609
To have myths, to have
tales-- fairy tales.

00:11:35.609 --> 00:11:36.400
To have everything.

00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:41.860
But what created writing, it
created very important things

00:11:41.860 --> 00:11:45.040
like law and science.

00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:49.140
Because law is something
that should be--

00:11:49.140 --> 00:11:53.100
you cannot treat it very
free, in a very free way.

00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:57.960
You should know it, for
sure, how to use this law.

00:11:57.960 --> 00:12:02.730
And narrative is very
rarely strict and precise.

00:12:02.730 --> 00:12:05.340
Narrative can be--
I can say what

00:12:05.340 --> 00:12:10.680
law is, you will say this to
somebody else, the same thing

00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:11.880
but with distortion.

00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:14.870
And finally, somebody
not in this room,

00:12:14.870 --> 00:12:17.280
but in the other
room, will completely

00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:18.670
hear the different thing.

00:12:18.670 --> 00:12:22.170
So writing allows us
to see the same things.

00:12:22.170 --> 00:12:24.960
And when we create
a judiciary system,

00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:30.300
we talk about law, it's a
must to know exactly the same

00:12:30.300 --> 00:12:32.370
that other people
know about these laws.

00:12:32.370 --> 00:12:35.235
Suddenly signs and history
also started to develop.

00:12:37.950 --> 00:12:42.090
Because you also save
a lot of your memory,

00:12:42.090 --> 00:12:44.970
not for remembering all the
things that all your ancestors

00:12:44.970 --> 00:12:48.540
created, but just doing all
your mundane and routine stuff

00:12:48.540 --> 00:12:51.210
knowing that you can find
somewhere in a library

00:12:51.210 --> 00:12:52.170
or whatever.

00:12:52.170 --> 00:12:55.170
Suddenly the beginning
of creation of writing,

00:12:55.170 --> 00:12:57.210
there were only a few
people in the world--

00:12:57.210 --> 00:12:59.760
a few small percentage
of the world--

00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:12.830
who had access to this to
this cave with precious gems,

00:13:12.830 --> 00:13:13.750
or whatever.

00:13:13.750 --> 00:13:15.260
How we call knowledge.

00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:20.070
But generally, it started
changing the world as well.

00:13:20.070 --> 00:13:23.100
And the fifth, in
my opinion is--

00:13:23.100 --> 00:13:24.950
We already talked
about religion.

00:13:24.950 --> 00:13:26.960
We could say that
religion is an invention.

00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:30.800
But religion wasn't a true
invention because religion--

00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:34.010
It took us thousands of years--
more and more and more--

00:13:34.010 --> 00:13:36.980
to come from just
primitive beliefs,

00:13:36.980 --> 00:13:40.260
to myths, to fairy tales, and
then to religion as we know it.

00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:45.740
But there was one concrete,
and one specific invention,

00:13:45.740 --> 00:13:47.840
where we talk about
religion, which

00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:53.930
really changed the history
and the path of development

00:13:53.930 --> 00:13:54.930
of human being.

00:13:54.930 --> 00:13:56.900
Which is monotheism.

00:13:56.900 --> 00:13:59.270
Because monotheism,
which was created,

00:13:59.270 --> 00:14:08.000
some argue, in Egypt, the end
of their ruling 1,200 years

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:09.230
before Christ.

00:14:09.230 --> 00:14:14.760
Some say that it was
created by Jewish people

00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:16.500
when they create a Judaism.

00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:20.190
We don't actually need
to understand exactly.

00:14:20.190 --> 00:14:23.880
What we need to understand, that
for the first time in history

00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:26.310
abstract thinking--

00:14:26.310 --> 00:14:27.870
sort of that high--

00:14:27.870 --> 00:14:34.890
that people created the idea of
invisible and transcendent god,

00:14:34.890 --> 00:14:36.630
who is omnipotent.

00:14:36.630 --> 00:14:38.447
And who also is very--

00:14:42.870 --> 00:14:45.450
God cannot do bad things.

00:14:45.450 --> 00:14:51.840
That's a big, big
difference from religion

00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:52.860
that we had before.

00:14:52.860 --> 00:14:55.860
For example, if you
talk about Greek gods.

00:14:55.860 --> 00:14:58.530
Greek gods were very
much like people.

00:14:58.530 --> 00:15:00.150
They behaved like people.

00:15:00.150 --> 00:15:01.090
They cheated.

00:15:01.090 --> 00:15:02.070
They killed.

00:15:02.070 --> 00:15:07.820
They did all the sins
that we people do.

00:15:07.820 --> 00:15:12.720
And actually, in ancient
pre-monotheism culture

00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:16.980
it was still bad to kill
people, or to do some bad stuff.

00:15:16.980 --> 00:15:20.490
But it was bad just
mostly because when

00:15:20.490 --> 00:15:24.720
you kill people, when
you kill somebody,

00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:26.160
you would be killed as well.

00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:30.060
Or you would be punished
because you deprived some family

00:15:30.060 --> 00:15:32.010
of labor force, or whatever.

00:15:32.010 --> 00:15:35.720
But monotheism, and Judaism,
and Christianity, and Islam,

00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:38.160
created moral.

00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:43.560
So when we started believing
that to kill, or to steal,

00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:48.910
or to cheat, is not bad just
because you violate some law,

00:15:48.910 --> 00:15:51.120
but it's bad because it's bad.

00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:55.170
And it is something that makes
your psyche suffer, and makes

00:15:55.170 --> 00:15:58.920
your soul suffering,
and you feel bad.

00:15:58.920 --> 00:16:07.560
And actually, this is
very obvious thing now.

00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:08.970
So what about that?

00:16:08.970 --> 00:16:11.910
We can think that moral
existed for all other time,

00:16:11.910 --> 00:16:12.610
but it's not.

00:16:12.610 --> 00:16:13.560
But it doesn't.

00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:14.280
It didn't.

00:16:14.280 --> 00:16:17.700
It exists only for
2,000 or 3,000 years.

00:16:17.700 --> 00:16:19.620
Before that, moral
was different,

00:16:19.620 --> 00:16:21.270
if it existed at all.

00:16:21.270 --> 00:16:28.760
So what we now have, we behave
not only in a practical way,

00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:31.220
and not only in an
instinctive way.

00:16:31.220 --> 00:16:34.010
Instinctive way as
a way of animals.

00:16:34.010 --> 00:16:36.020
Practical way is
something the human

00:16:36.020 --> 00:16:39.650
being created, even
before monotheism emerged.

00:16:39.650 --> 00:16:42.350
But what we call spiritual way--

00:16:42.350 --> 00:16:44.630
or way of the conscious--

00:16:44.630 --> 00:16:48.590
is something that this idea
that was probably first--

00:16:48.590 --> 00:16:55.910
or one of the first times
described in ten commandments,

00:16:55.910 --> 00:16:58.490
which we know from the Bible--

00:16:58.490 --> 00:17:00.170
is a fundamental thing.

00:17:00.170 --> 00:17:03.020
It also gave people
a freedom of choice.

00:17:03.020 --> 00:17:07.940
So it described a human
being as a creature

00:17:07.940 --> 00:17:15.589
which was granted by God
with freedom of choice.

00:17:15.589 --> 00:17:19.910
And freedom of choice, either
to violate commandments or not.

00:17:19.910 --> 00:17:21.500
To do this, or to do that.

00:17:21.500 --> 00:17:24.349
So we are free to
do whatever we want,

00:17:24.349 --> 00:17:28.430
but we know that at the end
we'll pay the price for that.

00:17:28.430 --> 00:17:33.580
Or we'll be rewarded for that.

00:17:33.580 --> 00:17:38.750
It changed human beings
behavior, I think, for good.

00:17:38.750 --> 00:17:41.810
Because now we're
different people

00:17:41.810 --> 00:17:44.910
than we were 2,000 or
3,000 thousand years ago.

00:17:44.910 --> 00:17:47.050
So these five
inventions, I think

00:17:47.050 --> 00:17:48.440
they are the most important.

00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:57.550
Because they framed
what we are now.

00:17:57.550 --> 00:18:02.390
And they framed our development
for the next 1,000 years.

00:18:02.390 --> 00:18:06.700
The inventions I will be talking
later, they are more practical,

00:18:06.700 --> 00:18:12.580
but they wouldn't be
possible without these five.

00:18:12.580 --> 00:18:16.150
Fire gun weapon--
it's much later.

00:18:16.150 --> 00:18:20.890
I put it as an invention,
as a separate invention.

00:18:20.890 --> 00:18:23.620
I'm not talking
about cold weapon.

00:18:23.620 --> 00:18:27.010
Because cold weapon--
even animals, even ape

00:18:27.010 --> 00:18:29.500
used stones for fighting.

00:18:29.500 --> 00:18:33.700
And it took us thousands of
years to come to good swords.

00:18:33.700 --> 00:18:42.820
And to have all these weapons
of destruction that Greeks,

00:18:42.820 --> 00:18:44.620
and Romans, and Chinese used.

00:18:44.620 --> 00:18:51.940
But what fire gun weapon did,
it equalized possibilities

00:18:51.940 --> 00:18:57.490
and military power
of rivals, or enemies

00:18:57.490 --> 00:19:00.330
of people who fight each other.

00:19:00.330 --> 00:19:02.860
Of states who fight each other.

00:19:02.860 --> 00:19:05.640
And, as you know,
fire gun weapon--

00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:07.830
although was it was
created in China--

00:19:07.830 --> 00:19:11.400
but mostly developed
at the beginning

00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:13.500
of the end of Middle
Ages and beginning

00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:15.510
of Renaissance in Europe.

00:19:15.510 --> 00:19:23.790
And finally it came to the point
when wars became unbearable.

00:19:23.790 --> 00:19:29.070
So at the beginning a big
country a lot of military force

00:19:29.070 --> 00:19:31.560
could conquer, easily,
a smaller country.

00:19:31.560 --> 00:19:35.670
And just because they
came with horses and were

00:19:35.670 --> 00:19:39.390
swords, and it was very
difficult to fight them.

00:19:39.390 --> 00:19:42.750
But then, with fire
guns, and with mortars,

00:19:42.750 --> 00:19:53.280
and with all these cannons, it's
much easier to defend yourself.

00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:59.580
And the last war that showed
us the probably impossibility

00:19:59.580 --> 00:20:06.150
of a former order, was a
Thirty Years' War in Europe,

00:20:06.150 --> 00:20:09.120
that finally ended up with
Westphalia Peace, which

00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:10.770
created modern states.

00:20:10.770 --> 00:20:15.390
Because modern states is
something that we understand

00:20:15.390 --> 00:20:18.810
as granted, although some
people question this now even

00:20:18.810 --> 00:20:20.070
in 2000's.

00:20:20.070 --> 00:20:21.160
We know about that.

00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:25.150
But modern state, a
state with borders,

00:20:25.150 --> 00:20:27.300
which is respected
by other states, no

00:20:27.300 --> 00:20:31.830
matter how small or how weak
it is, once it's recognized,

00:20:31.830 --> 00:20:32.940
it's recognized.

00:20:32.940 --> 00:20:35.730
Before Thirty Years' War,
there was no notion like that.

00:20:35.730 --> 00:20:37.800
Empires could do
whatever they wanted.

00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:40.530
Big kingdoms, they
conquered smaller kingdoms

00:20:40.530 --> 00:20:42.990
and acquired them
and did everything.

00:20:42.990 --> 00:20:47.580
But now after Westphalia
Peace in 1648,

00:20:47.580 --> 00:20:51.450
people started treating
states differently.

00:20:51.450 --> 00:20:55.890
And the main reason for
that was that to fight wars

00:20:55.890 --> 00:21:00.950
became very, very difficult,
and costful, and just--

00:21:00.950 --> 00:21:05.060
Two million people died
during these three decades,

00:21:05.060 --> 00:21:06.360
and nobody won.

00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:07.130
Nobody.

00:21:07.130 --> 00:21:08.700
It was still status quo.

00:21:08.700 --> 00:21:12.080
So they just came
to the point where

00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:14.790
they say we need to start
from the very beginning.

00:21:14.790 --> 00:21:18.350
So if not the fire gun,
we wouldn't have had that.

00:21:18.350 --> 00:21:21.230
Afterwards, some
scientific stuff.

00:21:25.570 --> 00:21:31.550
Printing led to Protestantism,
as a consequence

00:21:31.550 --> 00:21:33.280
to scientific and
industrial evolution

00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:34.480
in northern countries.

00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:38.440
Because printing made
knowledge affordable,

00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:42.820
both in figurative
and direct meaning.

00:21:42.820 --> 00:21:45.160
We started reading
books massively.

00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:49.630
We started reading books in our
languages, they got printed.

00:21:49.630 --> 00:21:54.280
And it was much easier to
read books than before.

00:21:54.280 --> 00:21:55.990
You didn't need to know Latin.

00:21:55.990 --> 00:22:00.490
And you didn't need to go to the
church to ask for permission.

00:22:00.490 --> 00:22:07.240
If you had enough money,
you could buy these books.

00:22:07.240 --> 00:22:11.200
And in 200 years after
printing was invented,

00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:17.140
northern Europe was already
booming and developing

00:22:17.140 --> 00:22:19.660
technologies and science.

00:22:19.660 --> 00:22:24.970
Then discovery of
America by Europeans

00:22:24.970 --> 00:22:29.380
also changed the
framework, and also changed

00:22:29.380 --> 00:22:31.480
what the world is now.

00:22:31.480 --> 00:22:37.530
You know that probably Chinese
could have discovered America.

00:22:37.530 --> 00:22:41.370
They actually started
creating expeditions

00:22:41.370 --> 00:22:45.270
during 15th century, but
they abruptly stopped them.

00:22:45.270 --> 00:22:47.070
Nobody knows why.

00:22:47.070 --> 00:22:48.900
Their ships were much bigger.

00:22:48.900 --> 00:22:52.600
Their potency was much
stronger magnitude.

00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:59.760
Their [INAUDIBLE] was way
better than these first Columbus

00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:01.740
ships, they were really small.

00:23:01.740 --> 00:23:04.240
But somehow Europeans
managed to do that.

00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:07.050
And finally, it
led to the creation

00:23:07.050 --> 00:23:09.570
of big European empires.

00:23:09.570 --> 00:23:14.850
Who afterwards, through
missionaries, and also trade

00:23:14.850 --> 00:23:21.620
companies, first enforced
the whole world to accept--

00:23:21.620 --> 00:23:28.580
and then probably also promoted
with much milder means--

00:23:28.580 --> 00:23:31.160
European way of
thinking, mindset.

00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:33.620
And actually added it to life.

00:23:33.620 --> 00:23:38.420
And nowadays we still have the
societies who think different.

00:23:38.420 --> 00:23:43.670
But mostly European,
or I would say,

00:23:43.670 --> 00:23:47.600
northern European practical
way of treating life,

00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:49.910
is dominating in the world now.

00:23:49.910 --> 00:23:56.060
And who knows if Chinese
discovered America what

00:23:56.060 --> 00:23:57.720
the world would have been now.

00:23:57.720 --> 00:23:58.980
We don't know.

00:23:58.980 --> 00:24:00.860
We just know that
it was Europeans.

00:24:00.860 --> 00:24:02.150
It was Columbus.

00:24:02.150 --> 00:24:08.540
And finally, it's an interesting
irony, and very important

00:24:08.540 --> 00:24:09.770
historical irony.

00:24:09.770 --> 00:24:13.910
You probably know
that Columbus--

00:24:13.910 --> 00:24:17.150
it was possible to organize
this expedition because Columbus

00:24:17.150 --> 00:24:25.520
came to Spanish kings,
Ferdinand and Isabella in 1492.

00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:27.710
It was the third time
he asked them for money.

00:24:27.710 --> 00:24:29.750
Two times before they refused.

00:24:29.750 --> 00:24:33.140
And 1492, they say OK,
we'll give you money.

00:24:33.140 --> 00:24:34.700
We have money now.

00:24:34.700 --> 00:24:37.450
Who knows why.

00:24:37.450 --> 00:24:40.210
Some of you know
why it was 1492.

00:24:40.210 --> 00:24:45.160
Why they couldn't do
that 1483, or something?

00:24:45.160 --> 00:24:51.290
That was exactly the year
that Spanish kings finally

00:24:51.290 --> 00:24:58.130
reconquered the last part of
Iberian Peninsula from Arabs.

00:24:58.130 --> 00:25:05.860
And that year they
took Grenadian

00:25:05.860 --> 00:25:09.840
where well a lot of Arabic
and Jewish rich people,

00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:11.270
and they got all this money.

00:25:11.270 --> 00:25:12.860
And they ruined all the stuff.

00:25:12.860 --> 00:25:14.870
And these were money
that they started

00:25:14.870 --> 00:25:17.570
using in their next endeavors.

00:25:17.570 --> 00:25:20.810
And actually, Arab
and Jewish money

00:25:20.810 --> 00:25:24.860
created a new Christian power.

00:25:24.860 --> 00:25:28.430
And it's ironic, but that's
how sometimes history

00:25:28.430 --> 00:25:30.710
is being done.

00:25:30.710 --> 00:25:33.500
Then some scientific inventions.

00:25:33.500 --> 00:25:37.880
Newton created his famous
laws, and Newton's mechanics,

00:25:37.880 --> 00:25:40.970
and it changed the
attitude to facts.

00:25:40.970 --> 00:25:44.960
Before Newton's
laws mostly people

00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:50.875
believed that faith,
matter of faith,

00:25:50.875 --> 00:25:53.780
was much more important
than matter of fact.

00:25:53.780 --> 00:25:56.000
And Newton's laws
were the first time

00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:01.760
when we could predict exactly,
without any divine force,

00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:08.750
that if the ball is at point A
now that it will be in a point

00:26:08.750 --> 00:26:12.170
B. And we knew 100% exactly.

00:26:12.170 --> 00:26:16.610
And it made people belief
in fact very powerful.

00:26:16.610 --> 00:26:19.760
And when we started
believing in facts,

00:26:19.760 --> 00:26:26.180
we started thinking in
this more practical way.

00:26:26.180 --> 00:26:29.900
And that how science
and industry developed.

00:26:29.900 --> 00:26:32.030
And that's why England,
and other northern European

00:26:32.030 --> 00:26:35.300
countries, started
proceeding and developing

00:26:35.300 --> 00:26:36.740
so fast afterwards.

00:26:36.740 --> 00:26:40.340
Facts, and matter of
facts, became dominating.

00:26:40.340 --> 00:26:42.560
In other parts of the world,
especially for example,

00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:45.410
in the part of the
world where most of us

00:26:45.410 --> 00:26:49.700
are from, Eastern Europe,
or for example, Asia--

00:26:49.700 --> 00:26:53.090
people didn't believe in
facts long afterwards.

00:26:53.090 --> 00:26:56.360
So it took us probably 200
or 300 years afterwards.

00:26:56.360 --> 00:27:01.850
Because societies like ours were
mainly transcendent and driven

00:27:01.850 --> 00:27:06.920
by irrational things like faith.

00:27:06.920 --> 00:27:09.230
And some spiritual things.

00:27:09.230 --> 00:27:12.860
English people became very
practical-- and in a good way,

00:27:12.860 --> 00:27:13.430
cynical--

00:27:13.430 --> 00:27:15.020
much earlier.

00:27:15.020 --> 00:27:18.140
And they started
to do achievements

00:27:18.140 --> 00:27:21.890
in practical fields,
mostly because of science.

00:27:21.890 --> 00:27:25.850
And Newton was the first, who
was the first person who opened

00:27:25.850 --> 00:27:29.860
this door of matter of fact.

00:27:29.860 --> 00:27:32.360
The direct consequence
of that, but I

00:27:32.360 --> 00:27:35.000
think it's a single and
a separate invention,

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:37.220
was a steam machine of wood.

00:27:37.220 --> 00:27:41.210
Because steam machine of
wood created modern industry.

00:27:41.210 --> 00:27:45.120
Manifold time increased
labor power used by man.

00:27:45.120 --> 00:27:46.580
And productivity, also.

00:27:46.580 --> 00:27:49.310
And reduced cost
of productivity.

00:27:49.310 --> 00:27:51.440
And liberated a
great amount of labor

00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:53.630
force to do the
other job, like then

00:27:53.630 --> 00:27:56.390
to be peasants in the fields.

00:27:56.390 --> 00:27:59.420
So it created plants,
factories and everything.

00:27:59.420 --> 00:28:04.130
Actually, the second
invention which

00:28:04.130 --> 00:28:11.210
also was a consequence of
this scientific revolution,

00:28:11.210 --> 00:28:12.620
was electricity.

00:28:12.620 --> 00:28:16.010
And James Maxwell, a
Scottish scientist,

00:28:16.010 --> 00:28:20.300
a very modest guy, who
was thinking, creating,

00:28:20.300 --> 00:28:21.800
working on electricity.

00:28:21.800 --> 00:28:24.920
Theoretically, he
created his Maxwell laws,

00:28:24.920 --> 00:28:35.210
which allowed us to create
many things that we see now.

00:28:35.210 --> 00:28:37.460
I don't think that LED's--

00:28:37.460 --> 00:28:43.460
but probably just our electric
lights, or everything--

00:28:43.460 --> 00:28:45.050
what electricity created.

00:28:45.050 --> 00:28:50.240
And funny thing is, when
these laws were discovered

00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:52.610
and written first in
scientific papers,

00:28:52.610 --> 00:28:55.520
most scientists didn't
accept them well.

00:28:55.520 --> 00:29:01.100
So it took probably 20 or 30
years before Maxwell theory

00:29:01.100 --> 00:29:06.830
proved its practical
value and made

00:29:06.830 --> 00:29:10.920
all of us using electricity.

00:29:10.920 --> 00:29:14.940
Three medical inventions
happened during these times.

00:29:14.940 --> 00:29:17.790
First was very important--

00:29:17.790 --> 00:29:20.820
and it happened even
before or, probably

00:29:20.820 --> 00:29:23.970
approximately the same time,
when Newton created his laws--

00:29:23.970 --> 00:29:28.470
and it was invention,
or creation, or the idea

00:29:28.470 --> 00:29:29.970
of blood circulation.

00:29:29.970 --> 00:29:32.400
It was made by English
scientist Harvey,

00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:35.500
and he first
understood that blood

00:29:35.500 --> 00:29:40.170
is circulating from arteries
to capillaries, and then

00:29:40.170 --> 00:29:41.760
through veins, back.

00:29:41.760 --> 00:29:46.770
And actually, you may ask
why is it so important?

00:29:46.770 --> 00:29:49.680
It is so important because
it gave us the idea what

00:29:49.680 --> 00:29:54.270
really blood is for our body.

00:29:54.270 --> 00:29:56.910
And it also gave
us the possibility

00:29:56.910 --> 00:30:02.080
to heal and cure some diseases,
and some really bad things

00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:04.380
with our bodies that
we couldn't do before.

00:30:04.380 --> 00:30:08.670
For example, we understood
that gangrene is,

00:30:08.670 --> 00:30:13.620
and all blood inflammations,
they cause deaths.

00:30:13.620 --> 00:30:17.340
And they knew how to treat
it afterwards much easier.

00:30:17.340 --> 00:30:19.740
But two inventions,
medical inventions,

00:30:19.740 --> 00:30:23.080
that came later in the
beginning of the 20th century,

00:30:23.080 --> 00:30:30.000
they even changed our life
even more rapid, and more

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:31.050
significant way.

00:30:31.050 --> 00:30:33.720
These are vaccines
and antibiotics.

00:30:33.720 --> 00:30:39.020
The first killed viruses,
the second killed bacterias.

00:30:39.020 --> 00:30:44.720
And if vaccines helped us
to stop epidemics of plague,

00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:47.880
and of Spanish flu--

00:30:47.880 --> 00:30:51.530
all this kind of stuff--

00:30:51.530 --> 00:30:53.700
and it helped in
a peaceful life,

00:30:53.700 --> 00:31:01.970
then antibiotics helped
in healing and curing

00:31:01.970 --> 00:31:06.890
wounded people, who were
wounded and injured during wars.

00:31:06.890 --> 00:31:11.810
And in first World War,
which Americans, or Irish,

00:31:11.810 --> 00:31:14.600
or British, called
Great War, people just

00:31:14.600 --> 00:31:17.660
died because of
inflammation all the time.

00:31:17.660 --> 00:31:21.880
Because they got everything.

00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:29.540
They got pneumonia, they
got serious injuries,

00:31:29.540 --> 00:31:32.270
nobody could get cure it.

00:31:32.270 --> 00:31:38.870
But after antibiotics and
vaccines were invented,

00:31:38.870 --> 00:31:42.320
the life expectancy
raised twice.

00:31:42.320 --> 00:31:45.530
So at the beginning of the 20th
century it was 40 years, now

00:31:45.530 --> 00:31:48.660
it's 75, or 70,
average in the world.

00:31:48.660 --> 00:31:50.540
It's almost twice.

00:31:50.540 --> 00:31:55.100
And I think these two
interventions probably

00:31:55.100 --> 00:31:58.760
made a major contribution
to this fact.

00:32:02.360 --> 00:32:07.780
If we talk about later
20th century inventions,

00:32:07.780 --> 00:32:09.590
it's long distance connections.

00:32:09.590 --> 00:32:11.210
Telegraph, telephone, and radio.

00:32:11.210 --> 00:32:12.430
It's actually one invention.

00:32:12.430 --> 00:32:15.160
We don't need to say
that it's three of them.

00:32:15.160 --> 00:32:16.910
It created mass culture.

00:32:16.910 --> 00:32:19.870
It created possibility to--

00:32:19.870 --> 00:32:25.250
it made world flatter,
even before internet.

00:32:25.250 --> 00:32:28.670
It didn't make world flat,
but it made it flatter.

00:32:28.670 --> 00:32:33.470
And it was the first step in
the whole bunch of inventions

00:32:33.470 --> 00:32:34.970
that were coming later.

00:32:34.970 --> 00:32:38.240
But many things, like
radio, created pop music.

00:32:38.240 --> 00:32:44.360
Radio created our first
political debates.

00:32:44.360 --> 00:32:47.420
Radio created, like an
old telephone connect.

00:32:47.420 --> 00:32:49.700
Connected all people
and relatives.

00:32:49.700 --> 00:33:02.710
And it changed--
how to say this?

00:33:02.710 --> 00:33:04.930
I mean, they changed
the way that we

00:33:04.930 --> 00:33:07.150
treated each other,
friends and families.

00:33:07.150 --> 00:33:10.000
For example, if you
have your phone,

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:13.210
you don't need to see
your parents every day,

00:33:13.210 --> 00:33:15.340
or every week, you
just call them.

00:33:15.340 --> 00:33:19.000
And then that
somehow alienates us.

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:20.890
And that's not a good thing.

00:33:20.890 --> 00:33:22.690
But that's something
that telephone,

00:33:22.690 --> 00:33:25.390
and other long distance
connection created.

00:33:25.390 --> 00:33:30.640
We started changing
our everyday behavior.

00:33:30.640 --> 00:33:35.410
Quantum mechanics, which
actually, probably some of you

00:33:35.410 --> 00:33:37.030
know.

00:33:37.030 --> 00:33:40.930
Quantum mechanics was created by
a very young scientist of age,

00:33:40.930 --> 00:33:45.400
from 20 to 25, at the
turn of the 20th century.

00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:50.170
And quantum mechanics makes
the job of all of you possible.

00:33:50.170 --> 00:33:52.300
If not that, I
think there will be

00:33:52.300 --> 00:33:58.270
no computers, no internet, no
Google, no this room, nothing.

00:33:58.270 --> 00:34:02.020
Because that's where
everything started.

00:34:02.020 --> 00:34:04.990
Three or four young scientists
in Germany, England,

00:34:04.990 --> 00:34:10.510
and Austria, were so dare to say
that all the science they knew

00:34:10.510 --> 00:34:18.389
before was completely bullshit,
and it didn't describe

00:34:18.389 --> 00:34:23.449
the world of atoms, molecules,
and electrons, and particles.

00:34:23.449 --> 00:34:27.110
So they created this new
science, which actually,

00:34:27.110 --> 00:34:31.010
also, is a very important
cornerstone of civilization

00:34:31.010 --> 00:34:33.150
of human beings.

00:34:33.150 --> 00:34:37.460
Because it needs changing
of our perception.

00:34:40.230 --> 00:34:43.790
It changed our perception
of what is matter of fact.

00:34:43.790 --> 00:34:46.550
Because quantum mechanics is
actually something we cannot

00:34:46.550 --> 00:34:48.650
understand by our brain.

00:34:48.650 --> 00:34:50.480
If some of you, many
of you understand

00:34:50.480 --> 00:34:51.500
what I'm talking about.

00:34:51.500 --> 00:34:52.625
Some of you probably don't.

00:34:52.625 --> 00:34:53.630
I'll explain.

00:34:53.630 --> 00:34:57.740
Quantum mechanics says that
particle-- let's say electron--

00:34:57.740 --> 00:35:02.610
can, if you see a big, big
house with 10 entrances--

00:35:02.610 --> 00:35:07.100
So electron enter all these
entrances simultaneously.

00:35:07.100 --> 00:35:13.730
Not being divided into
parts, being as a whole,

00:35:13.730 --> 00:35:15.875
and you can find it in
each of these entrances,

00:35:15.875 --> 00:35:18.440
at the same time,
and we'll be there.

00:35:18.440 --> 00:35:19.850
So we cannot understand that.

00:35:19.850 --> 00:35:22.580
I mean, our brain
is not quantum.

00:35:22.580 --> 00:35:23.540
It is classical.

00:35:23.540 --> 00:35:25.970
So we cannot understand.

00:35:25.970 --> 00:35:30.290
How can it be possible that
one particle can be present

00:35:30.290 --> 00:35:34.910
at the same moment of time, not
being divided in 10 entrances,

00:35:34.910 --> 00:35:38.240
and it can enter
these entrances,

00:35:38.240 --> 00:35:40.430
and there's still one particle.

00:35:40.430 --> 00:35:44.630
But the truth is that
that's how the world works.

00:35:44.630 --> 00:35:51.120
So it requires from us not
to understand, but to believe

00:35:51.120 --> 00:35:52.370
in power effects.

00:35:52.370 --> 00:35:56.880
To believe in experiments more
than an our analytical skills.

00:35:56.880 --> 00:35:59.670
And it's something that
changed the science at all.

00:35:59.670 --> 00:36:04.290
Because before that
what we did was--

00:36:04.290 --> 00:36:08.875
we first made experiment, then
we started to understand that,

00:36:08.875 --> 00:36:09.750
and then we started--

00:36:09.750 --> 00:36:10.320
OK.

00:36:10.320 --> 00:36:13.680
If our understanding corresponds
with our experiment, OK.

00:36:13.680 --> 00:36:15.450
That's a good explanation.

00:36:15.450 --> 00:36:19.740
But quantum mechanics, for the
first time, when we believe in

00:36:19.740 --> 00:36:23.940
experiment even if we don't
understand how it works.

00:36:23.940 --> 00:36:27.450
And that's a very
important thing.

00:36:27.450 --> 00:36:33.650
Because the fact, and the power
of fact rules now our brains.

00:36:33.650 --> 00:36:36.780
Before that, our brains
ruled everything.

00:36:36.780 --> 00:36:40.550
That's why we saw that
the world was flat

00:36:40.550 --> 00:36:45.890
and we couldn't believe
that our globe was round.

00:36:45.890 --> 00:36:52.130
And we couldn't believe
that we our Earth

00:36:52.130 --> 00:36:54.770
was rotating around sun.

00:36:54.770 --> 00:36:59.000
We thought it was vice versa.

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:00.260
Because that was our brain.

00:37:00.260 --> 00:37:02.740
Or our analytical
skills told us.

00:37:02.740 --> 00:37:06.530
But quantum mechanics
changed it completely.

00:37:06.530 --> 00:37:09.950
And suddenly, after
quantum mechanics

00:37:09.950 --> 00:37:18.300
a couple of inventions that
we see now became possible.

00:37:18.300 --> 00:37:20.550
Television.

00:37:20.550 --> 00:37:23.220
Television, actually-- the
biggest impact television

00:37:23.220 --> 00:37:27.370
had was, in my opinion,
it was not a pop culture.

00:37:27.370 --> 00:37:28.800
But it was politics.

00:37:28.800 --> 00:37:32.070
Because politics
created new politicians.

00:37:32.070 --> 00:37:34.800
Created much bigger populism.

00:37:34.800 --> 00:37:46.710
And when we now
regret about the times

00:37:46.710 --> 00:37:49.530
when we had a big
political leaders,

00:37:49.530 --> 00:37:56.290
and now we have just mediocre
politicians, one of the things

00:37:56.290 --> 00:37:57.610
is television.

00:37:57.610 --> 00:38:05.520
Because television gave
politicians possibility

00:38:05.520 --> 00:38:10.470
not to talk person to
person, but then just to make

00:38:10.470 --> 00:38:11.550
one appearance.

00:38:11.550 --> 00:38:14.760
To say some primitive things
but to be very energetic.

00:38:14.760 --> 00:38:18.030
And to be very persuasive.

00:38:18.030 --> 00:38:19.950
And people started
believing in that.

00:38:19.950 --> 00:38:20.970
And that's how--

00:38:20.970 --> 00:38:24.240
Populism was
present in the world

00:38:24.240 --> 00:38:27.050
before, way long
before television.

00:38:27.050 --> 00:38:31.800
But television made
it an absolution.

00:38:31.800 --> 00:38:36.590
And then, atomic energy, it's
the third revolution in energy

00:38:36.590 --> 00:38:38.670
after steam and electricity.

00:38:38.670 --> 00:38:42.450
I don't need to say about
good and bad impacts of that.

00:38:42.450 --> 00:38:46.140
Chernobyl and Hiroshima
are one of the bad impacts,

00:38:46.140 --> 00:38:48.900
but there are some also
good because it gives us

00:38:48.900 --> 00:38:51.360
a great amount of energy.

00:38:51.360 --> 00:38:55.410
And the last three
inventions, 18, 19, and 20, I

00:38:55.410 --> 00:38:57.600
will not explain it
to you because you

00:38:57.600 --> 00:38:59.190
will explain much more.

00:38:59.190 --> 00:39:02.390
You know better about
these three inventions.

00:39:02.390 --> 00:39:05.610
It's computer, it's internet,
and it's social networks.

00:39:05.610 --> 00:39:09.660
The one thing I can say,
that I separate all of them

00:39:09.660 --> 00:39:12.100
because I don't think
that they are free.

00:39:12.100 --> 00:39:15.420
They are dependent, but
they are still separate.

00:39:15.420 --> 00:39:17.160
Because computer
is something that

00:39:17.160 --> 00:39:21.090
makes us powerful in counting.

00:39:21.090 --> 00:39:28.920
In finding solutions.

00:39:28.920 --> 00:39:33.890
Internet is something
that changes our--

00:39:33.890 --> 00:39:36.810
it's something like writing.

00:39:36.810 --> 00:39:42.300
When writing was created,
the information we had before

00:39:42.300 --> 00:39:44.295
became useless and we
started using information

00:39:44.295 --> 00:39:45.450
in a different way.

00:39:45.450 --> 00:39:49.560
Internet-- it's the
other revolution.

00:39:49.560 --> 00:39:53.490
I know that now all of you
are thinking about today's

00:39:53.490 --> 00:39:54.750
knowledge and education.

00:39:54.750 --> 00:39:57.170
And we understand
that after internet

00:39:57.170 --> 00:40:01.950
the whole bunch of education
that we had before is useless.

00:40:01.950 --> 00:40:05.370
What Google made now
makes 70% of what

00:40:05.370 --> 00:40:09.710
is taught in schools
absolutely not necessary.

00:40:09.710 --> 00:40:11.910
We need to change everything.

00:40:11.910 --> 00:40:15.240
And countries like
Canada, like Ireland I

00:40:15.240 --> 00:40:18.360
know, Finland, South
Korea, Israel--

00:40:18.360 --> 00:40:21.690
already has changed a lot
of education of children.

00:40:21.690 --> 00:40:23.970
We in Ukraine, for
example, in Eastern Europe,

00:40:23.970 --> 00:40:28.680
still need to come closer.

00:40:28.680 --> 00:40:33.130
And there was one
questionable invention

00:40:33.130 --> 00:40:35.740
that I don't include
in the top 20

00:40:35.740 --> 00:40:40.210
because I think that this
invention, or innovation, still

00:40:40.210 --> 00:40:41.740
hasn't changed mankind.

00:40:41.740 --> 00:40:43.750
But I do believe that it will.

00:40:43.750 --> 00:40:46.540
And it's probably the
question, what's next?

00:40:46.540 --> 00:40:53.350
In my point of view, it's what
I would call it neuroscience

00:40:53.350 --> 00:40:55.390
and artificial intelligence.

00:40:55.390 --> 00:40:59.440
We still don't know
how these two fields

00:40:59.440 --> 00:41:01.180
will impact human beings.

00:41:01.180 --> 00:41:04.840
We already see some things,
but it's only the beginning.

00:41:04.840 --> 00:41:08.450
I really think that it will
be a fundamental change.

00:41:08.450 --> 00:41:13.900
Both artificial intelligence
and the way of our

00:41:13.900 --> 00:41:16.060
altering and
changing our brains.

00:41:16.060 --> 00:41:19.750
It will create some unbelievable
stuff we cannot imagine.

00:41:19.750 --> 00:41:24.850
I just believe it will come very
soon, probably in one or two

00:41:24.850 --> 00:41:26.180
generations.

00:41:26.180 --> 00:41:28.750
I think most of you
will witness it,

00:41:28.750 --> 00:41:31.480
and then we'll see
how serious was it.

00:41:31.480 --> 00:41:37.677
And will it be something that
comparable to hot food or not?

00:41:37.677 --> 00:41:38.510
Thank you very much.

00:41:38.510 --> 00:41:45.280
[APPLAUSE]

00:41:45.280 --> 00:41:46.780
SPEAKER: Thank you
very much, Slava.

00:41:46.780 --> 00:41:50.440
Actually, I'm really happy
that I heard your lecture today

00:41:50.440 --> 00:41:52.870
because you as a
creative person,

00:41:52.870 --> 00:41:55.450
and a person who sees
things differently,

00:41:55.450 --> 00:41:57.410
give me a little bit of
interesting perspective

00:41:57.410 --> 00:41:58.410
about many things today.

00:41:58.410 --> 00:41:59.010
SLAVA VAKARCHUK: Thank you.

00:41:59.010 --> 00:42:00.759
SPEAKER: And we are
mostly engineers here,

00:42:00.759 --> 00:42:03.220
so you know we are very
focused on engineering things

00:42:03.220 --> 00:42:05.185
and this was much
wider than actually

00:42:05.185 --> 00:42:06.250
I, personally, expected.

00:42:06.250 --> 00:42:07.590
So I'm very happy to be here.

00:42:07.590 --> 00:42:11.450
We still have, probably,
two minutes for questions.

00:42:11.450 --> 00:42:11.950
And--

00:42:11.950 --> 00:42:13.366
SLAVA VAKARCHUK:
Only two minutes?

00:42:13.366 --> 00:42:15.280
SPEAKER: Well, four
but we still need to--

00:42:15.280 --> 00:42:17.520
SLAVA VAKARCHUK: It's the end?

00:42:17.520 --> 00:42:18.790
SPEAKER: No problem.

00:42:18.790 --> 00:42:20.956
SLAVA VAKARCHUK: You should
have stopped me earlier.

00:42:20.956 --> 00:42:22.900
SPEAKER: But I was
so happy about what

00:42:22.900 --> 00:42:25.150
you were talking about that
I didn't want to stop you.

00:42:25.150 --> 00:42:26.080
Don't worry about
this, it's fine--

00:42:26.080 --> 00:42:27.538
SLAVA VAKARCHUK:
Can we have can we

00:42:27.538 --> 00:42:30.880
have 10, 15 minutes, because
I'm struggling to get

00:42:30.880 --> 00:42:31.522
some questions.

00:42:31.522 --> 00:42:32.980
I came here to hear
people as well.

00:42:32.980 --> 00:42:34.330
SPEAKER: Actually, we
need to ask our engineer

00:42:34.330 --> 00:42:35.970
and see if they will
allow us to do it.

00:42:35.970 --> 00:42:36.550
SLAVA VAKARCHUK: Yeah?

00:42:36.550 --> 00:42:37.330
Thank you very much.

00:42:37.330 --> 00:42:37.630
SPEAKER: Excellent.

00:42:37.630 --> 00:42:39.171
SLAVA VAKARCHUK:
Appreciate it, mate.

00:42:39.171 --> 00:42:41.120
SPEAKER: So we have
more time for questions.

00:42:41.120 --> 00:42:42.010
Excellent.

00:42:42.010 --> 00:42:44.980
So guys if you have any
questions from audience,

00:42:44.980 --> 00:42:46.350
I will do it like this--

00:42:46.350 --> 00:42:47.850
SLAVA VAKARCHUK:
From what we heard,

00:42:47.850 --> 00:42:49.305
or something
completely different.

00:42:49.305 --> 00:42:49.640
Don't hesitate.

00:42:49.640 --> 00:42:50.515
SPEAKER: Don't worry.

00:42:50.515 --> 00:42:53.204
Just don't please be
political, it's very important.

00:42:53.204 --> 00:42:54.370
But everything else is fine.

00:42:56.719 --> 00:42:57.385
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:42:57.385 --> 00:42:57.650
SLAVA VAKARCHUK: Hello.

00:42:57.650 --> 00:42:58.430
AUDIENCE: Slava, thank you.

00:42:58.430 --> 00:42:59.490
It's great to see you.

00:42:59.490 --> 00:42:59.990
And--

00:42:59.990 --> 00:43:00.330
SLAVA VAKARCHUK: Thank you.

00:43:00.330 --> 00:43:02.610
AUDIENCE: I'll be
quick with my question.

00:43:02.610 --> 00:43:03.816
If you think of--

00:43:03.816 --> 00:43:05.940
first of all, people know
you through music, right?

00:43:05.940 --> 00:43:07.871
So let's call you a
rock star, in a sense.

00:43:07.871 --> 00:43:08.370
But--

00:43:08.370 --> 00:43:09.536
SLAVA VAKARCHUK: In a sense.

00:43:09.536 --> 00:43:10.916
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:10.916 --> 00:43:12.540
AUDIENCE: As
stereotypical, a rock star

00:43:12.540 --> 00:43:15.270
would be doing a lot of
music, and let's say, drugs.

00:43:15.270 --> 00:43:17.490
Whereas you, for example,
do a lot of music--

00:43:17.490 --> 00:43:19.073
SLAVA VAKARCHUK: I
did beer yesterday.

00:43:19.073 --> 00:43:20.430
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:20.430 --> 00:43:21.930
AUDIENCE: But you
do a lot of music,

00:43:21.930 --> 00:43:24.040
and science and social,
and all of this.

00:43:24.040 --> 00:43:27.490
So my question is, where do you
get the energy and inspiration?

00:43:27.490 --> 00:43:29.670
How do you manage to
maintain this inspiration

00:43:29.670 --> 00:43:31.749
to keep doing all of that?

00:43:31.749 --> 00:43:33.540
SLAVA VAKARCHUK: It
depends on who you ask.

00:43:33.540 --> 00:43:35.581
People who believe in
quantum mechanics or people

00:43:35.581 --> 00:43:38.070
who believe in God.

00:43:38.070 --> 00:43:39.540
I don't know.

00:43:39.540 --> 00:43:41.730
Actually, I believe
in God and I think

00:43:41.730 --> 00:43:43.990
these two correspond very well.

00:43:43.990 --> 00:43:50.370
And I think that our
energy comes from God.

00:43:50.370 --> 00:43:52.710
And God is not in
a religion way,

00:43:52.710 --> 00:43:55.920
but it's something
big in the world

00:43:55.920 --> 00:43:57.780
that you can concentrate
on, and you have

00:43:57.780 --> 00:44:00.270
this channel of interaction.

00:44:00.270 --> 00:44:02.910
And I know that I
sometimes have this energy

00:44:02.910 --> 00:44:05.130
and I don't know
where it comes from.

00:44:05.130 --> 00:44:07.344
Especially when you have
five concerts and a row

00:44:07.344 --> 00:44:08.760
and at the end of
the five concert

00:44:08.760 --> 00:44:12.119
you're still jumping and
singing, energetically.

00:44:12.119 --> 00:44:12.660
I don't know.

00:44:12.660 --> 00:44:17.430
It's not my credit.

00:44:17.430 --> 00:44:21.581
It's somebody there.

00:44:21.581 --> 00:44:22.500
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:44:22.500 --> 00:44:24.750
So I see one person.

00:44:24.750 --> 00:44:25.250
[INAUDIBLE]

00:44:25.250 --> 00:44:25.530
SLAVA VAKARCHUK: Whoa!

00:44:25.530 --> 00:44:26.550
SPEAKER: --games.

00:44:26.550 --> 00:44:27.831
But we'll-- Sorry.

00:44:27.831 --> 00:44:28.330
Thought

00:44:28.330 --> 00:44:29.880
SLAVA VAKARCHUK: It looks nice.

00:44:29.880 --> 00:44:30.900
SPEAKER: It's actually
a very good thing.

00:44:30.900 --> 00:44:31.525
I like it.

00:44:31.525 --> 00:44:32.340
AUDIENCE: Hello, Slava.

00:44:32.340 --> 00:44:32.650
SLAVA VAKARCHUK: Hello.

00:44:32.650 --> 00:44:34.460
AUDIENCE: Thank you so much
for coming to us, and--

00:44:34.460 --> 00:44:34.730
SLAVA VAKARCHUK: Thank you.

00:44:34.730 --> 00:44:36.840
AUDIENCE: It's a great
honor to have you here.

00:44:36.840 --> 00:44:39.000
My question would be
about your travel.

00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:41.050
About your world tours.

00:44:41.050 --> 00:44:43.770
You meet a lot of
Ukrainians who live abroad,

00:44:43.770 --> 00:44:47.000
and what would be kind
of three main differences

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:50.310
with those people
who live in country?

00:44:50.310 --> 00:44:53.310
Like if you meet
Diaspora Ukrainians,

00:44:53.310 --> 00:44:55.590
what would be their
difference in the way

00:44:55.590 --> 00:44:57.511
they would be thinking and--

00:44:57.511 --> 00:44:59.510
SLAVA VAKARCHUK: You mean
comparable to Ukraine?

00:44:59.510 --> 00:45:02.100
AUDIENCE: Yeah, comparing to
those people who live in the--

00:45:02.100 --> 00:45:05.240
SLAVA VAKARCHUK:
Comparing to Ukraine.

00:45:05.240 --> 00:45:07.960
You know, I will say only one.

00:45:07.960 --> 00:45:12.390
And that makes, I think,
something optimistic.

00:45:12.390 --> 00:45:19.630
You know, in our country
we always complain on how

00:45:19.630 --> 00:45:23.500
Ukrainians are not effective,
they cannot create a proper

00:45:23.500 --> 00:45:30.490
institution, they are not people
who can stick into some laws.

00:45:30.490 --> 00:45:32.290
Sometimes not very hardworking--

00:45:32.290 --> 00:45:34.570
That's something we
complaining about in comparison

00:45:34.570 --> 00:45:35.500
to other countries.

00:45:35.500 --> 00:45:37.750
But when I see Ukrainian
in other countries,

00:45:37.750 --> 00:45:45.160
I see them among most
industrious, hardworking,

00:45:45.160 --> 00:45:51.730
successful, and some of the most
successful people in the world.

00:45:51.730 --> 00:45:54.640
That brings me to
the idea that that's

00:45:54.640 --> 00:46:02.180
institutions and environment
that matters most.

00:46:02.180 --> 00:46:06.920
And Ukrainians are people who,
in the world, make difference.

00:46:06.920 --> 00:46:09.710
So the one thing we
need to do in Ukraine

00:46:09.710 --> 00:46:12.590
to create these institutions
and that environment

00:46:12.590 --> 00:46:14.510
that you have in
these countries.

00:46:14.510 --> 00:46:16.760
So that's what we need to do.

00:46:16.760 --> 00:46:18.480
And there is no
other difference.

00:46:18.480 --> 00:46:20.569
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:46:20.569 --> 00:46:21.652
SPEAKER: [INAUDIBLE] Yeah.

00:46:21.652 --> 00:46:22.152
Yeah.

00:46:25.570 --> 00:46:27.320
SLAVA VAKARCHUK: That's
really ridiculous.

00:46:27.320 --> 00:46:28.580
AUDIENCE: Hi Slava.

00:46:28.580 --> 00:46:31.490
You've briefly touched on
the subject of education

00:46:31.490 --> 00:46:32.776
and how it needs to change.

00:46:32.776 --> 00:46:34.400
And I know your dad
was very passionate

00:46:34.400 --> 00:46:36.320
about education
system and change,

00:46:36.320 --> 00:46:37.860
as I was the witness of it.

00:46:37.860 --> 00:46:40.130
So my question is,
how would you like

00:46:40.130 --> 00:46:43.700
to see the education
system develop and progress

00:46:43.700 --> 00:46:45.680
into 21st century?

00:46:45.680 --> 00:46:48.440
And what changes would
you like to see first?

00:46:48.440 --> 00:46:49.580
Thank you.

00:46:49.580 --> 00:46:52.280
SLAVA VAKARCHUK: In my opinion,
the most important today

00:46:52.280 --> 00:46:57.260
is not to give information to
children, which you are already

00:46:57.260 --> 00:46:59.030
here in Google are doing.

00:46:59.030 --> 00:47:03.660
So, probably you can have
one or two rivalries,

00:47:03.660 --> 00:47:08.040
which I think is always good
for competition and for quality.

00:47:08.040 --> 00:47:09.720
You still don't have.

00:47:09.720 --> 00:47:13.770
But that's something we
need to leave behind.

00:47:13.770 --> 00:47:22.660
What we need to do is to teach
children how to live lives.

00:47:22.660 --> 00:47:23.910
How to live.

00:47:23.910 --> 00:47:27.400
That is, how to
be a personality.

00:47:27.400 --> 00:47:30.520
How to analyze.

00:47:30.520 --> 00:47:32.350
How to percept.

00:47:32.350 --> 00:47:33.550
How to perceive.

00:47:33.550 --> 00:47:37.060
How to get, and how to give.

00:47:37.060 --> 00:47:42.790
These things, that many thousand
years were abandoned, now,

00:47:42.790 --> 00:47:46.000
little by little, are
starting to come closer.

00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:49.940
And in some education systems,
they already dominate.

00:47:49.940 --> 00:47:51.950
In the best universities
in the world,

00:47:51.950 --> 00:47:54.820
that's what they
teach students now.

00:47:54.820 --> 00:47:58.330
But in some countries,
we still in this--

00:47:58.330 --> 00:48:03.770
I wouldn't say in Ice
Age, or Stone Age--

00:48:03.770 --> 00:48:07.790
but it's still a lot
of things to be done.

00:48:07.790 --> 00:48:11.310
So, I believe we
need to come to shift

00:48:11.310 --> 00:48:16.770
our focus from information
to a personality.

00:48:20.165 --> 00:48:22.590
SPEAKER: Who else?

00:48:22.590 --> 00:48:25.020
Ahh.

00:48:25.020 --> 00:48:25.830
You can throw it.

00:48:25.830 --> 00:48:27.080
It's throwable.

00:48:27.080 --> 00:48:28.040
It's like a game.

00:48:28.040 --> 00:48:28.580
SLAVA VAKARCHUK: Throw it.

00:48:28.580 --> 00:48:29.190
It's fine.

00:48:29.190 --> 00:48:29.505
SPEAKER: Throw it.

00:48:29.505 --> 00:48:30.004
Throw it.

00:48:30.004 --> 00:48:31.987
Don't worry about this.

00:48:31.987 --> 00:48:32.820
AUDIENCE: Hi, Slava.

00:48:32.820 --> 00:48:34.650
Just a quick question--
that you mentioned

00:48:34.650 --> 00:48:36.150
that the invention
of money made us

00:48:36.150 --> 00:48:38.532
a bit more cautious,
for instance.

00:48:38.532 --> 00:48:39.990
Several of the
things you mentioned

00:48:39.990 --> 00:48:42.450
are about creating narratives,
and new narratives.

00:48:42.450 --> 00:48:44.640
And how we should
believe stuff that we

00:48:44.640 --> 00:48:46.230
haven't believed before.

00:48:46.230 --> 00:48:48.554
Considering that,
especially in the West,

00:48:48.554 --> 00:48:50.220
you're getting more
and more constrained

00:48:50.220 --> 00:48:54.570
by economic circumstances by the
time you get to the age of 20

00:48:54.570 --> 00:48:59.910
and 30, how do you see that
tension between material safety

00:48:59.910 --> 00:49:03.240
and the need to challenge
the status quo, playing out

00:49:03.240 --> 00:49:06.455
for our generation afterwards?

00:49:06.455 --> 00:49:08.580
Would people have enough
freedom to actually create

00:49:08.580 --> 00:49:13.034
a new narrative without fearing
for their material well-being?

00:49:13.034 --> 00:49:14.700
SLAVA VAKARCHUK:
That's a good question,

00:49:14.700 --> 00:49:18.200
and what we are
facing now is actually

00:49:18.200 --> 00:49:24.480
the struggle between our
fears and our desires.

00:49:24.480 --> 00:49:28.810
And because we see it
in Western Europe--

00:49:28.810 --> 00:49:31.080
probably Western Europe
and Northern America

00:49:31.080 --> 00:49:35.400
are pioneers in this
new environment--

00:49:35.400 --> 00:49:38.680
we're going to live
some period of time.

00:49:38.680 --> 00:49:44.550
I don't have an
answer about what

00:49:44.550 --> 00:49:48.270
will be the end, or
consequence, or impact of that.

00:49:48.270 --> 00:49:49.140
I don't have it.

00:49:49.140 --> 00:49:55.970
I just know that, somehow,
people during the last 30,000

00:49:55.970 --> 00:50:00.880
years of their history
were managed to create

00:50:00.880 --> 00:50:03.580
a proper way to handle it.

00:50:03.580 --> 00:50:06.850
Sometimes this is not
probably the best way.

00:50:06.850 --> 00:50:08.300
You could find better.

00:50:08.300 --> 00:50:14.260
But it's still as a
river, or a small creek,

00:50:14.260 --> 00:50:17.080
it somehow finds its path.

00:50:17.080 --> 00:50:20.920
And I believe that European--

00:50:20.920 --> 00:50:23.860
and generally, not only
European but human being's

00:50:23.860 --> 00:50:26.430
civilization--
will find its path.

00:50:26.430 --> 00:50:31.490
That the side effect
of civilization

00:50:31.490 --> 00:50:34.990
is that it makes
us more anxious.

00:50:34.990 --> 00:50:37.390
And makes us more stressed.

00:50:37.390 --> 00:50:46.860
And if the biggest problem
of our ancestors in Stone Age

00:50:46.860 --> 00:50:50.665
was a fear to get
eaten by a lion.

00:50:50.665 --> 00:50:53.760
If the biggest fear of
our Middle Aged colleagues

00:50:53.760 --> 00:50:59.910
was to get sick and
die from plague,

00:50:59.910 --> 00:51:04.710
so now our biggest fear is
our stress and our anxiety.

00:51:04.710 --> 00:51:08.430
And more and more people
go crazy about that--

00:51:08.430 --> 00:51:11.520
sometimes, literally, but
mostly figuratively-- and it

00:51:11.520 --> 00:51:14.760
changes our everyday life.

00:51:14.760 --> 00:51:17.970
And we become less
and less happy.

00:51:17.970 --> 00:51:21.000
We need to understand that
to be happy you don't need

00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:25.680
to have a big mansion in
London, or private jet, or even

00:51:25.680 --> 00:51:27.330
a good computer.

00:51:27.330 --> 00:51:30.270
Or even a great job,
or get good salary--

00:51:30.270 --> 00:51:31.185
or even your family.

00:51:34.950 --> 00:51:37.090
What makes you
happy is yourself.

00:51:37.090 --> 00:51:40.300
It's your perception in
your brain, in your soul.

00:51:40.300 --> 00:51:44.740
There are some people who
are happy to have 10 children

00:51:44.740 --> 00:51:46.690
and be happy
fathers and mothers.

00:51:46.690 --> 00:51:48.970
There are people who
are happy to travel

00:51:48.970 --> 00:51:51.190
to the end of their lives
and not have families.

00:51:51.190 --> 00:51:53.480
There are people who
want to have money

00:51:53.480 --> 00:51:55.730
and they are really
happy to have money.

00:51:55.730 --> 00:51:57.680
There are people who don't care.

00:51:57.680 --> 00:52:02.440
But our nowaday narrative
gives less freedom.

00:52:02.440 --> 00:52:04.980
All of us are forced
to live the same lives.

00:52:04.980 --> 00:52:05.950
Here is one.

00:52:05.950 --> 00:52:07.390
You need to have a good salary.

00:52:07.390 --> 00:52:10.510
You to have wife and children,
or husband and children.

00:52:10.510 --> 00:52:14.360
You need to be treated
correctly by society,

00:52:14.360 --> 00:52:16.280
and you need to behave this way.

00:52:16.280 --> 00:52:18.370
You cannot live in the forest.

00:52:18.370 --> 00:52:19.990
You cannot do that.

00:52:19.990 --> 00:52:22.900
But people who lived
300, 400 years ago,

00:52:22.900 --> 00:52:26.620
1,000 years ago, sometimes
they suffered more.

00:52:26.620 --> 00:52:28.180
But were they less happy?

00:52:28.180 --> 00:52:29.800
Or are we more happy?

00:52:29.800 --> 00:52:31.330
I don't think so.

00:52:31.330 --> 00:52:35.110
There are some people who
have serious diseases who are

00:52:35.110 --> 00:52:37.530
happier than healthy people.

00:52:37.530 --> 00:52:41.080
So happiness, I think, is
much more important for us

00:52:41.080 --> 00:52:43.096
than development.

00:52:43.096 --> 00:52:44.470
So we need to
focus on happiness.

00:52:44.470 --> 00:52:51.790
[APPLAUSE]

00:52:51.790 --> 00:52:53.230
SPEAKER: Last two.

00:52:53.230 --> 00:52:54.480
SLAVA VAKARCHUK: Well, no, no.

00:52:54.480 --> 00:52:57.075
Last three [INAUDIBLE]
because it's always like that.

00:52:57.075 --> 00:52:57.950
Last three questions.

00:52:57.950 --> 00:53:00.157
One, two, and there was three.

00:53:00.157 --> 00:53:00.740
SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:53:00.740 --> 00:53:01.850
Yeah.

00:53:01.850 --> 00:53:02.817
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:53:02.817 --> 00:53:03.650
SLAVA VAKARCHUK: Hi.

00:53:03.650 --> 00:53:05.066
AUDIENCE: It's
actually a pleasure

00:53:05.066 --> 00:53:08.060
to see you here, being a
fan of yours since I was 11.

00:53:08.060 --> 00:53:09.900
I have a quick question.

00:53:09.900 --> 00:53:12.440
So, because you're
a rock star, you're

00:53:12.440 --> 00:53:14.500
kind of traveling
around the world

00:53:14.500 --> 00:53:16.350
and see loads of countries.

00:53:16.350 --> 00:53:18.980
The first question is,
what's your favorite country?

00:53:18.980 --> 00:53:23.371
And second, would you ever
consider to move abroad

00:53:23.371 --> 00:53:23.870
and leave--

00:53:23.870 --> 00:53:25.036
SLAVA VAKARCHUK: To Ireland.

00:53:25.036 --> 00:53:27.457
[LAUGHTER]

00:53:27.457 --> 00:53:29.540
SLAVA VAKARCHUK: This is
not a political question.

00:53:29.540 --> 00:53:34.070
SPEAKER: No, it's not
a political question.

00:53:34.070 --> 00:53:36.800
SLAVA VAKARCHUK: I cannot say
which country is my favorite

00:53:36.800 --> 00:53:40.080
country because I've been
to so many countries,

00:53:40.080 --> 00:53:44.590
many of them has
things that I love.

00:53:44.590 --> 00:53:49.070
I would say my last
love is Australia.

00:53:49.070 --> 00:53:52.850
Because we went to Australia
this year and I think

00:53:52.850 --> 00:53:56.960
Melbourne was a city that
most of our team and crew

00:53:56.960 --> 00:53:59.450
fell in love with immediately.

00:53:59.450 --> 00:54:02.240
The only bad thing--
probably also a good thing--

00:54:02.240 --> 00:54:04.040
is it's very far.

00:54:04.040 --> 00:54:07.970
And I think the bad things
makes good things, good.

00:54:07.970 --> 00:54:12.200
Because I think
that was the country

00:54:12.200 --> 00:54:24.390
when I met more happy people
than in any other place

00:54:24.390 --> 00:54:25.900
in the world.

00:54:25.900 --> 00:54:31.090
Australia, is my--
let's say, it's

00:54:31.090 --> 00:54:33.670
present number one in my chart.

00:54:33.670 --> 00:54:36.610
But you know, chart
always changes.

00:54:36.610 --> 00:54:39.040
So probably Ireland
will be one day.

00:54:39.040 --> 00:54:43.510
But I will say, exactly,
that from the point of view

00:54:43.510 --> 00:54:47.380
of pub life, Ireland
is so far number one.

00:54:47.380 --> 00:54:50.470
What we've seen yesterday--
me and Vlada, and Julia--

00:54:50.470 --> 00:54:53.920
we haven't seen
anywhere in the world.

00:54:53.920 --> 00:54:57.430
We poked in three
bars just to see.

00:54:57.430 --> 00:55:01.210
And in each of them, we saw
like crazy parties singing

00:55:01.210 --> 00:55:03.790
and doing-- you know,
I can't imagine it,

00:55:03.790 --> 00:55:08.434
not only in Ukraine, but I can't
imagine it America, in the UK--

00:55:08.434 --> 00:55:10.100
You can see it only
in Ireland, I think.

00:55:10.100 --> 00:55:11.530
It's unbelievable.

00:55:11.530 --> 00:55:13.700
How people are partying.

00:55:13.700 --> 00:55:15.792
AUDIENCE: Maybe you
should stay a bit longer.

00:55:15.792 --> 00:55:16.750
SLAVA VAKARCHUK: Sorry?

00:55:16.750 --> 00:55:18.833
AUDIENCE: Maybe you should
stay a bit longer and--

00:55:18.833 --> 00:55:21.280
SLAVA VAKARCHUK: If my
favorite thing was partying,

00:55:21.280 --> 00:55:25.170
then I probably will do
that, but no, it's not.

00:55:25.170 --> 00:55:27.580
So-- two and three.

00:55:27.580 --> 00:55:28.570
SPEAKER: Just throw it.

00:55:28.570 --> 00:55:30.790
SLAVA VAKARCHUK: Poo!

00:55:30.790 --> 00:55:32.200
Do want practice in basketball?

00:55:32.200 --> 00:55:34.110
I used to play basketball,
I can teach you.

00:55:34.110 --> 00:55:34.670
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:55:34.670 --> 00:55:36.750
I should have played more.

00:55:36.750 --> 00:55:38.060
Thanks, Slava, for the talk.

00:55:38.060 --> 00:55:41.420
I've been to a concert a
long time ago in [INAUDIBLE]

00:55:41.420 --> 00:55:43.006
and so I have a question.

00:55:43.006 --> 00:55:43.880
I have two questions.

00:55:43.880 --> 00:55:47.330
You can either answer both,
or choose one of them.

00:55:47.330 --> 00:55:50.520
First question, what are the
plans for your band, Okean

00:55:50.520 --> 00:55:53.270
Elzy, and second one,
what's your opinion now

00:55:53.270 --> 00:55:56.530
about Ukrainian music?

00:55:56.530 --> 00:56:05.320
SLAVA VAKARCHUK: Our
plans for Okean Elzy,

00:56:05.320 --> 00:56:08.500
I didn't intend to talk about
that in the nearest month,

00:56:08.500 --> 00:56:11.230
so we wanted to make a
proper press conference

00:56:11.230 --> 00:56:12.310
and to say something.

00:56:12.310 --> 00:56:18.740
But I will throw
some light into that.

00:56:18.740 --> 00:56:22.340
After we finish with this
tour, which is the end of June,

00:56:22.340 --> 00:56:25.406
we'll make a break and we
don't know when will be next.

00:56:25.406 --> 00:56:26.780
We don't have any
specific plans,

00:56:26.780 --> 00:56:28.160
so we really don't
know when will

00:56:28.160 --> 00:56:31.010
be next concerts, next
tours, next album.

00:56:31.010 --> 00:56:36.710
We want to recuperate and
to relax, and just to think.

00:56:36.710 --> 00:56:40.970
And I wish we come back as soon
as possible, but I don't know.

00:56:40.970 --> 00:56:43.850
It can be a year, it can
be two, it can be five.

00:56:43.850 --> 00:56:45.290
Nobody knows.

00:56:45.290 --> 00:56:50.850
So that's something where
the question is open.

00:56:50.850 --> 00:56:51.710
Ukrainian music.

00:56:51.710 --> 00:56:53.750
Ukrainian music is unbelievable.

00:56:53.750 --> 00:56:55.610
It is booming now.

00:56:55.610 --> 00:56:59.420
I think that probably it's
one of the best periods

00:56:59.420 --> 00:57:01.160
of Ukrainian music I've seen.

00:57:01.160 --> 00:57:03.500
So many great bands
and musicians.

00:57:03.500 --> 00:57:05.520
Some of them are
still underground.

00:57:05.520 --> 00:57:07.820
Some of them are known already.

00:57:07.820 --> 00:57:09.350
But it's great.

00:57:09.350 --> 00:57:12.050
I'm looking forward to
seeing the next generation

00:57:12.050 --> 00:57:15.410
of Ukrainian musicians becoming
as popular as Okean Elzy,

00:57:15.410 --> 00:57:17.039
or even bigger.

00:57:17.039 --> 00:57:18.330
SPEAKER: And the last question.

00:57:20.880 --> 00:57:22.200
SLAVA VAKARCHUK: Yeah, yeah.

00:57:22.200 --> 00:57:24.319
SPEAKER: Yeah, yeah.

00:57:24.319 --> 00:57:25.110
SPEAKER: Excellent.

00:57:25.110 --> 00:57:26.940
SLAVA VAKARCHUK: Good shot.

00:57:26.940 --> 00:57:27.774
AUDIENCE: Hi, Slava.

00:57:27.774 --> 00:57:28.606
SLAVA VAKARCHUK: Hi.

00:57:28.606 --> 00:57:31.230
AUDIENCE: I want to finish on
the question that is actually

00:57:31.230 --> 00:57:34.560
more related to innovations,
and you kind of talked

00:57:34.560 --> 00:57:37.020
about artificial intelligence
and how important it's

00:57:37.020 --> 00:57:38.460
going to be in the future.

00:57:38.460 --> 00:57:42.850
Obviously, it's going to help
us solve simple problems.

00:57:42.850 --> 00:57:45.000
But what about music and arts?

00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:47.910
Do you think it will
overtake the human?

00:57:47.910 --> 00:57:51.690
Or what's the value of
artificially created music

00:57:51.690 --> 00:57:52.860
and art going to be?

00:57:52.860 --> 00:57:55.560
SLAVA VAKARCHUK: I
don't know, exactly.

00:57:55.560 --> 00:57:58.940
I don't know because you
come to a very important

00:57:58.940 --> 00:58:00.780
philosophic question.

00:58:00.780 --> 00:58:04.880
Is art a brain creation?

00:58:04.880 --> 00:58:07.910
Or is art a--

00:58:07.910 --> 00:58:10.130
what we call, a soul creation?

00:58:10.130 --> 00:58:12.200
As a materialist, we
understand that soul

00:58:12.200 --> 00:58:14.810
is a rather abstract thing.

00:58:14.810 --> 00:58:17.630
Although some people can
say that you can derive it

00:58:17.630 --> 00:58:23.180
from our neural system, from
serotonin, and [INAUDIBLE],

00:58:23.180 --> 00:58:24.630
and all these things.

00:58:24.630 --> 00:58:26.840
But I don't know.

00:58:26.840 --> 00:58:30.440
From what I've seen
from first attempts

00:58:30.440 --> 00:58:34.580
to do artificial music, it
sounds clumsy and awkward.

00:58:34.580 --> 00:58:36.650
But it's only the beginning.

00:58:36.650 --> 00:58:39.340
So probably one day
we will start crying

00:58:39.340 --> 00:58:44.120
and we got goosebumps from
music that robots created.

00:58:44.120 --> 00:58:45.980
I don't know.

00:58:45.980 --> 00:58:50.840
You want my fair answer?

00:58:50.840 --> 00:58:53.930
What do I want to see?

00:58:53.930 --> 00:58:57.080
I'm a human being nationalist.

00:58:57.080 --> 00:59:03.010
So I prefer that human beings
create human stuff and robot

00:59:03.010 --> 00:59:05.250
create everything else.

00:59:05.250 --> 00:59:07.010
But I'm not sure that
we'll be like that.

00:59:07.010 --> 00:59:08.570
I don't know.

00:59:08.570 --> 00:59:09.180
SPEAKER: OK.

00:59:09.180 --> 00:59:10.190
So thank you very much.

00:59:10.190 --> 00:59:12.040
[APPLAUSE]
