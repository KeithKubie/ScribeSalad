00:00:06.047 --> 00:00:08.380
SPEAKER 1: Please welcome to
Google, Miss Sarah Williams

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:08.910
Goldhagen.

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.330
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:15.650
SARAH WILLIAMS
GOLDHAGEN: Thank you.

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:18.440
I'm really excited to be here.

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:20.644
Really excited to be at Detroit.

00:00:20.644 --> 00:00:22.310
There's a part of me
that feels like I'm

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:25.430
preaching to the converted
because you guys know

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:27.360
the built environment matters.

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:29.990
It's been changing
a lot here and so.

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:34.654
Nonetheless, even
those people who do

00:00:34.654 --> 00:00:36.320
know that the built
environment matters,

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.560
don't necessarily know
all the ways it matters

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:42.290
or why it matters.

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:43.920
And there are plenty of people--

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.829
all you have to do is look at
most of the American landscape

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:50.120
and you know there are plenty
of people who don't think

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.500
it matters very much at all.

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.790
So I wrote this book
because I really

00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:01.790
needed to explain
to a wider audience

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:06.650
why they should care about
design and about architecture.

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:09.710
And it took me through
a whole journey

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:14.480
into environmental psychology
and cognitive neuroscience,

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:18.710
and frankly, fields
that I really

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:20.690
didn't have that much
exposure to until I

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:22.730
started working on the book.

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:24.800
And I ended up, I
think, making the best

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:29.630
case I could for how to think
about the built environment.

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:32.270
And how to think about
approaching, designing

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:33.610
it, and making it better.

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:37.130
So what this talk
today focuses on really

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:42.650
is kind of conceptual reframings
of how to think about the built

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:45.680
environment, and then I
show you some projects

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:51.320
that actually embody and use
some of the design principles

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:52.910
that I came up with
that are really

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:56.403
central to people's experiences
of the built environment.

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:02.960
Why is this up, you may wonder.

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.120
We're looking at nature.

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:07.400
This is the first
conceptual reframing

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.830
I want to encourage which
is, it was only really

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:15.110
50 or 75 years ago when I
was a kid, not 75 years ago,

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:16.770
that when people
thought of nature,

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.760
they thought of rivers,
and mountains, and forests,

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.760
and fields, and
disaggregated elements.

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.270
Rivers had their
own biological logic

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:29.160
and forests had
theirs, for example.

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.200
But then, as people figured
out the polluting effects

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:38.150
of automobiles, the unintended
but toxic secondary effects

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:43.010
on animals of pesticides,
and so on, this eventually

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:44.330
led to a paradigm shift.

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:48.620
And people began to reframe
how they thought about nature,

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:54.230
conceptualizing it as a single,
multifaceted, and profoundly

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:59.640
interconnected phenomenon which
they called the environment--

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:03.170
so from nature to
the environment.

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:06.620
And then following that
reframing as the environment,

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:11.900
the environment became a terrain
of social and political debate

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.180
leading to all sorts
of policy initiatives

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:16.790
in public health
and social justice,

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:19.400
environmental protection,
and now, of course,

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.840
around climate change.

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:26.210
So the way people once
thought about nature,

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:28.730
before the environmental
revolution, which really

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:32.030
started in the
1960s, quite closely

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:35.000
resembles the way most
people think about the built

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.620
environment today.

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:37.910
There are buildings.

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:40.400
Buildings are created
by architects.

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:42.530
There's parks and
public squares designed

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:43.880
by landscape architects.

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:47.390
There's infrastructure,
bridges, roads, et cetera.

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:51.040
Those are designed
by civil engineers.

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.540
And then there's
streetscapes like these.

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:56.300
This is Greenwich
Village on your right

00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:00.140
and Louisville,
Kentucky on your left.

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:05.480
Streetscapes and
these kinds of things

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:07.910
are the [? professional ?]
province of urban designers

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:10.490
and city planners
who, all too often,

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:15.350
work with their hands tied
behind their backs, frankly.

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:18.019
But even though this is the
way both the marketplace

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:21.470
and professional disciplines
parcel out the built

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:25.470
environment, it's wrong.

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:28.340
It's wrong because that's not
how people experience built

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:30.440
environments.

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:32.750
For people, the
built environment

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:38.030
as we experience it, is one
continuous, interrelated,

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:45.200
integrated entity where what
we see outside the building

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:47.650
through the window is
as important as what

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:51.240
we're experiencing
inside the building.

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:53.870
So this monolithic
tower that you

00:04:53.870 --> 00:05:01.100
see on the left, which is by a
highly respected architecture

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:06.110
firm, REX, looms
pretty forebodingly

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:08.610
over the streetscape to
which it's connected,

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:11.660
and which it bridges
over, and it looms also

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:16.480
over the little landscape
park that's on the left.

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:21.850
And the small four-story
vernacular buildings.

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:23.612
My husband, when he
looked at this slide,

00:05:23.612 --> 00:05:24.820
he said you mean the schmutz?

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:29.510
On the right.

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:32.972
So people need to think
about the built environment--

00:05:32.972 --> 00:05:35.180
the way that people think
about the built environment

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:37.000
needs a paradigm shift.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.640
Just as in the 1960s
and '70s, nature

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:41.980
was reconceptualized
not as a panoply

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:47.260
of desegregated elements, but as
a single integrated [? hull. ?]

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.630
We need not to think about
architecture, buildings,

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:52.000
civil engineers, city
planning, and so on,

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.850
but a continuous
built environment,

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:58.930
and that is where the
vast majority of people

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:03.250
all over the world spend
well over 90% of their lives.

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:06.490
And it's designed, all of it.

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:10.060
There are decisions and each
part of the built environment

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:12.010
is a series of
decisions that could

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:13.990
have been made differently.

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:16.600
It's critical.

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:20.020
So today, new
scientific findings

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:23.080
are streaming in from a lot
of disparate disciplines,

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:26.020
most importantly from
cognitive neuroscience

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:28.570
and from environmental
psychology,

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:31.060
revealing a lot about
how people actually

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:34.660
experience built environments,
both as individuals

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:37.270
and in social groups.

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:39.370
And all these
findings and research

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:41.290
suggests that many of
the ways that people

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:42.940
think about the
built environment

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:44.830
also needs to be
reconceptualized.

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:47.860
People tend to act as
though the environments

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:50.590
that we occupy, that we
work in, that we live in,

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:54.550
and so on, they tend to
think of it as like a stage.

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:57.520
And our lives are like
these little mini dramas

00:06:57.520 --> 00:06:59.260
that take place on this stage.

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:02.020
And what you're focused on
is the drama of your life.

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:06.310
You're not focused on the stage,
the stage is just a platform.

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:08.980
Not true.

00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:11.740
What's emerging is that the
built environment is not

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:13.840
neutral at all like a stage.

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:16.840
It plays an active
role in many dimensions

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:21.190
of human internal and
social experience.

00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:25.060
For example, who knew
that the buildings

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:28.330
we inhabit profoundly
affect our health.

00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:31.210
And more generally,
how we feel physically.

00:07:31.210 --> 00:07:35.480
Or that the environments we
inhabit affect what and how,

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:39.400
as well as how well we think.

00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:41.710
That's kind of amazing.

00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:44.650
Indeed, what's emerging
clearly indicates

00:07:44.650 --> 00:07:46.990
that the built
environment's effects on us

00:07:46.990 --> 00:07:50.020
are far, far greater
than anyone, even

00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:53.200
architects, appreciate.

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:54.970
So take the example--

00:07:54.970 --> 00:07:57.390
and that's what you
see on the slides--

00:07:57.390 --> 00:08:01.990
of how built environments
affect our physical health.

00:08:01.990 --> 00:08:04.450
There was a study
in the early 1970s,

00:08:04.450 --> 00:08:06.190
and then there have
been a lot of studies

00:08:06.190 --> 00:08:09.250
that have followed
off of this one, that

00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:15.250
showed that after patients
had gallbladder surgery,

00:08:15.250 --> 00:08:20.470
they were released from the
hospital 30% more quickly

00:08:20.470 --> 00:08:26.770
and suffered about 30% less
pain if they happened to land

00:08:26.770 --> 00:08:33.669
in a recovery room that had a
view of a pastoral landscape

00:08:33.669 --> 00:08:37.059
rather than a recovery room
across the hall that looked out

00:08:37.059 --> 00:08:39.299
on a brick wall.

00:08:39.299 --> 00:08:44.530
30% quicker, that's a full day
earlier these patients were

00:08:44.530 --> 00:08:49.090
discharged, 30% fewer
requests for pain medication

00:08:49.090 --> 00:08:50.500
along the way.

00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:51.340
That's a big impact.

00:08:57.490 --> 00:09:00.910
So one of the places in the
built environment that's

00:09:00.910 --> 00:09:03.730
already beginning to
incorporate some of this work

00:09:03.730 --> 00:09:05.440
is in the health care industry.

00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:09.220
In spite of the fact that a
lot of the hospitals and stuff

00:09:09.220 --> 00:09:12.910
aren't that great,
they're getting better.

00:09:12.910 --> 00:09:17.459
They're already having an
impact on the health care

00:09:17.459 --> 00:09:18.000
architecture.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:25.330
On your left, for example,
is the Nanaimo Emergency

00:09:25.330 --> 00:09:30.160
Department on Vancouver
Island where the architects--

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:33.140
so it's an emergency room.

00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:36.820
The architects basically
parceled out the emergency room

00:09:36.820 --> 00:09:40.060
which was like for 60 or 70
beds, something like that,

00:09:40.060 --> 00:09:42.130
into these little
pods of spaces.

00:09:42.130 --> 00:09:46.300
And then, each little pod of
space got dropped with a light

00:09:46.300 --> 00:09:50.470
well into the center and a
little garden in the lightwell.

00:09:50.470 --> 00:09:55.510
So you lie in bed
as you're in the ER

00:09:55.510 --> 00:09:58.900
and you're looking
out on a garden.

00:09:58.900 --> 00:10:00.880
How amazing is that?

00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:04.600
You think every ER department
should be like this.

00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:06.190
They get natural light.

00:10:06.190 --> 00:10:08.800
They get a little green.

00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:11.680
But natural light can
ameliorate some forms

00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:16.780
of mental illness such as
depression, that's well-known.

00:10:16.780 --> 00:10:19.780
And, of course,
whether or not a room

00:10:19.780 --> 00:10:21.910
receives natural
light, whether it's

00:10:21.910 --> 00:10:24.280
in your home or your
workplace or with other,

00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:29.260
depends on how the
building is designed.

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:32.350
As well as where you are in the
corporate hierarchy, I guess.

00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:38.170
But our knowledge of light's
effects on mental health

00:10:38.170 --> 00:10:42.340
is becoming so fine grained,
it's really so fascinating,

00:10:42.340 --> 00:10:46.450
that now we know that people
suffering from bipolar disorder

00:10:46.450 --> 00:10:51.250
recover from a mania much
more quickly if they happen

00:10:51.250 --> 00:10:55.120
to land in a room, if
they're in-patients,

00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:58.190
that receives a lot
of morning light,

00:10:58.190 --> 00:11:01.870
rather than a room that receives
a lot of afternoon light.

00:11:01.870 --> 00:11:04.810
Same amount of light,
but morning light

00:11:04.810 --> 00:11:09.430
has a bigger effect on
reducing the symptoms of mania

00:11:09.430 --> 00:11:12.080
more quickly.

00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:15.880
So there's study after
study of this kind of stuff

00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:18.400
of the effects of
our environments,

00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:20.590
the physical
environments on health.

00:11:20.590 --> 00:11:22.090
But health's not the only thing.

00:11:26.870 --> 00:11:29.560
The built environment
affects us not only

00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:33.290
in these kind of very
quantifiable, physical, health

00:11:33.290 --> 00:11:36.610
ways, it affects us in
all sorts of ways that

00:11:36.610 --> 00:11:38.040
are really quite surprising.

00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:43.030
We now know from
cognitive neuroscience

00:11:43.030 --> 00:11:46.545
that most of what we think
is actually nonconscious.

00:11:46.545 --> 00:11:49.210
And I use the word nonconscious
rather than unconscious

00:11:49.210 --> 00:11:52.820
because I don't want anybody
to ask me about Freud.

00:11:52.820 --> 00:11:54.160
Nonconscious.

00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:56.380
But also, I use the
word "nonconscious"

00:11:56.380 --> 00:12:00.820
because consciousness is
really on a spectrum where

00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:05.080
nonconscious is over here and
hyperconscious is over there.

00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:08.830
And things move-- can
move along that spectrum.

00:12:08.830 --> 00:12:11.830
That being said, most of
what we think, most of what

00:12:11.830 --> 00:12:16.900
we process at any given moment
is about 90% nonconscious.

00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:17.500
That's big.

00:12:21.610 --> 00:12:25.510
And most of the nonconscious
schemas and associations

00:12:25.510 --> 00:12:30.670
that people deploy to rapidly
process their environments

00:12:30.670 --> 00:12:34.270
and their daily experiences
in and about the world,

00:12:34.270 --> 00:12:36.640
originates in the
blunt fact that humans

00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:40.180
live in the kind of
bodies that they do.

00:12:40.180 --> 00:12:42.910
And they experience the
world and the things in it

00:12:42.910 --> 00:12:46.480
according to conceptual
categories that are

00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:49.060
derived from their embodiment.

00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:51.910
Our cognitions are
profoundly influenced,

00:12:51.910 --> 00:12:56.510
they're even structured by the
fact of our human embodiment,

00:12:56.510 --> 00:12:58.640
of living in bodies.

00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:01.090
What does that mean
that my thoughts are

00:13:01.090 --> 00:13:03.160
structured by my embodiment?

00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:06.160
It's kind of abstract?

00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:07.960
Let's take a metaphor
that everybody

00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:10.300
knows which is
thinking inside the box

00:13:10.300 --> 00:13:11.635
or thinking outside the box.

00:13:14.770 --> 00:13:17.860
We intuitively
understood that metaphor

00:13:17.860 --> 00:13:20.560
because we know
what it feels like

00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:23.380
or we can imagine what it
feels like to be inside a box.

00:13:23.380 --> 00:13:25.490
It's kind of confined.

00:13:25.490 --> 00:13:32.020
It doesn't allow for a whole a
lot of movement or flexibility

00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:33.040
or whatever.

00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:37.480
And we also know what it feels
like to emerge out of a box.

00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:39.820
It's kind of liberated.

00:13:39.820 --> 00:13:42.790
And I like this example
a lot because there

00:13:42.790 --> 00:13:46.660
was a psychological study
where the researchers actually

00:13:46.660 --> 00:13:51.610
constructed like a 10
by 10 by 10 foot box

00:13:51.610 --> 00:13:54.250
and they put people
inside of it with a desk

00:13:54.250 --> 00:13:56.860
and they gave them a test.

00:13:56.860 --> 00:13:59.300
And they said, take this test.

00:13:59.300 --> 00:14:01.960
And what the
subjects didn't know

00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:05.000
is that they were
measuring creativity.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:06.640
So they took the test.

00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:08.290
Went away.

00:14:08.290 --> 00:14:10.450
Two weeks later, they came back.

00:14:10.450 --> 00:14:11.830
Same box.

00:14:11.830 --> 00:14:17.080
They said sit outside
this box and take a test.

00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:21.010
A different version of the
same test measuring creativity.

00:14:21.010 --> 00:14:25.840
Well, lo and behold, people who
were sitting outside the box

00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:30.010
scored consistently higher
on measures of creativity

00:14:30.010 --> 00:14:32.510
than people who were
sitting inside the box.

00:14:32.510 --> 00:14:34.600
So that's like a metaphor
that we understand

00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:37.730
because we live in bodies
and we occupy containers,

00:14:37.730 --> 00:14:40.430
and so on, in the world.

00:14:40.430 --> 00:14:44.050
It's part of this
larger picture of what

00:14:44.050 --> 00:14:47.470
we're calling embodied
cognition and the schemas

00:14:47.470 --> 00:14:50.210
that we use to understand
our experiences.

00:14:53.050 --> 00:14:55.360
And that's just
one example of how

00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:58.500
the environments we
inhabit affect the ways we

00:14:58.500 --> 00:15:00.580
think because of
our nonconscious

00:15:00.580 --> 00:15:03.100
and embodied associations
that we bring to them.

00:15:06.130 --> 00:15:11.150
So another example
about cognition.

00:15:11.150 --> 00:15:12.512
I think this is really cool.

00:15:12.512 --> 00:15:14.470
It makes me think I should
have gone to college

00:15:14.470 --> 00:15:17.080
in a different place.

00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:21.700
It's been shown that students
who take exams in rooms

00:15:21.700 --> 00:15:25.330
with ceilings that
are painted sky blue

00:15:25.330 --> 00:15:31.540
score higher than when they
take exams in rooms that are not

00:15:31.540 --> 00:15:34.560
painted sky blue, with ceilings
that are not painted sky blue.

00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:38.020
And more generally,
people who work or learn

00:15:38.020 --> 00:15:40.570
in environments
with high ceilings

00:15:40.570 --> 00:15:43.700
consistently score better
on tests of creativity

00:15:43.700 --> 00:15:47.680
than when they are in
environments with low ceilings.

00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:50.950
So all of this stuff is like--
that's why I'm saying yes,

00:15:50.950 --> 00:15:53.920
we get that the built
environment is important,

00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:56.410
but the ways--

00:15:56.410 --> 00:15:58.910
who knew all of these ways?

00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:07.220
Emotions, that's one that
maybe people intuitively

00:16:07.220 --> 00:16:08.910
get more quickly.

00:16:08.910 --> 00:16:11.990
It's like you know that
you walk into a dump

00:16:11.990 --> 00:16:14.900
and you feel a little dumpy.

00:16:14.900 --> 00:16:17.690
So the fact that the
built environments,

00:16:17.690 --> 00:16:21.050
the environments we inhabit,
influence our emotions

00:16:21.050 --> 00:16:24.380
is maybe less surprising.

00:16:24.380 --> 00:16:26.667
We look at a bright
yellow staircase

00:16:26.667 --> 00:16:29.000
with a wood-- this is actually
a hospital that was built

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:33.230
in the 1920s on your left.

00:16:33.230 --> 00:16:36.050
And the architect consciously
painted the stairs

00:16:36.050 --> 00:16:39.230
this sunny, brilliant yellow.

00:16:39.230 --> 00:16:42.080
And he also-- this was at the
point that architects were

00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:44.780
really fascinated with metal--

00:16:44.780 --> 00:16:47.090
and so he put a metal
banister on there,

00:16:47.090 --> 00:16:49.620
but he said nobody
wants to touch metal.

00:16:49.620 --> 00:16:51.260
Metal's gross to touch.

00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:52.850
It's always cold.

00:16:52.850 --> 00:16:55.070
It transmits too much--

00:16:55.070 --> 00:16:57.590
it collects the air
around it too quickly.

00:16:57.590 --> 00:17:01.756
So he put a wooden banister on.

00:17:01.756 --> 00:17:04.170
And he was right.

00:17:04.170 --> 00:17:06.470
You look at a sunny
staircase and you

00:17:06.470 --> 00:17:11.900
imagine touching a warm banister
that's made out of wood,

00:17:11.900 --> 00:17:17.099
and it feels like a better
space than the other.

00:17:17.099 --> 00:17:19.490
Now this is one that
I particularly love,

00:17:19.490 --> 00:17:22.490
this example, which is
this is the interior

00:17:22.490 --> 00:17:26.240
of the cathedral at
[? Amyah ?] in France.

00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:29.300
And if you haven't seen
it, you should go see it.

00:17:29.300 --> 00:17:32.660
But you can imagine
other spaces that you've

00:17:32.660 --> 00:17:35.360
been in where you just
walk in to go, wow!

00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:37.520
Unbelievable.

00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:40.790
So think of that experience,
standing in a cathedral

00:17:40.790 --> 00:17:44.930
or whatever place
really awed you and you

00:17:44.930 --> 00:17:46.520
thought was incredible.

00:17:49.208 --> 00:17:52.280
In [? Amyah, ?] you
can't help but feel

00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:56.530
this wonderful
admixture of emotions.

00:17:56.530 --> 00:18:01.640
You're personally small and
a little bit overwhelmed.

00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:04.130
While at the same time,
you're spiritually

00:18:04.130 --> 00:18:08.180
uplifted because you have this
glorious creation surrounding

00:18:08.180 --> 00:18:10.340
you.

00:18:10.340 --> 00:18:13.700
And scientists have
demonstrated that when

00:18:13.700 --> 00:18:20.630
people feel that feeling
of awe, that feeling itself

00:18:20.630 --> 00:18:26.660
nudges them towards what are
called pro-social thoughts,

00:18:26.660 --> 00:18:31.400
to consider their individual
place in a larger community

00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:35.990
and in a larger cosmos,
which in turn gets

00:18:35.990 --> 00:18:41.010
them thinking about their shared
humanity with other people.

00:18:41.010 --> 00:18:45.530
So places that inspire awe,
what Burke in the 18th century

00:18:45.530 --> 00:18:49.610
called the sublime,
demonstrably help people

00:18:49.610 --> 00:18:52.820
feel connected to one another.

00:18:52.820 --> 00:18:53.360
Who knew?

00:18:59.455 --> 00:19:02.000
It isn't an exaggeration
to say that built

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:05.060
environments and specifically,
the design of built

00:19:05.060 --> 00:19:10.480
environments, affect how
people fare physically.

00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:15.680
They affect how they think,
decide, interact with others,

00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:17.990
as well as how they
feel emotionally.

00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:24.020
What we now know is that
these effects are real

00:19:24.020 --> 00:19:26.790
and they're not negligible.

00:19:26.790 --> 00:19:29.960
So what this suggests
is a second reframing.

00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:34.880
The first was from architecture,
landscape architecture,

00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:37.470
to the built environment.

00:19:37.470 --> 00:19:39.980
The second reframing that
I think we need to do

00:19:39.980 --> 00:19:44.120
is instead of talking about
the mind/body connection which

00:19:44.120 --> 00:19:51.230
we hear about all the time,
it's the mind/body/environment

00:19:51.230 --> 00:19:52.370
connection.

00:19:52.370 --> 00:19:54.320
That's what we need
to be thinking about

00:19:54.320 --> 00:19:55.760
because we're humans.

00:19:55.760 --> 00:20:00.080
We live in habitats and
those habitats profoundly

00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:04.400
shape what we think,
how we feel, what we do,

00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:06.350
and how we communicate
with others.

00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:12.610
Another logical
implication of this

00:20:12.610 --> 00:20:15.390
is that there's
another way we need

00:20:15.390 --> 00:20:19.030
to rethink the way that
most people currently

00:20:19.030 --> 00:20:23.230
think about buildings as well
as landscapes and cityscapes.

00:20:23.230 --> 00:20:25.930
Today in the media and
in professional practice,

00:20:25.930 --> 00:20:29.880
the built environment is
typically bifurcated in two.

00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:32.890
There's architecture
on the one hand.

00:20:32.890 --> 00:20:36.880
Obviously, the building
on the right up above.

00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:39.880
Fancy forms, kind of cool.

00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:41.320
You can imagine being there.

00:20:41.320 --> 00:20:43.210
Wow, that would be great.

00:20:43.210 --> 00:20:44.680
This is by Zaha Hadid.

00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:45.840
It's in Azerbaijan.

00:20:48.460 --> 00:20:51.160
So architecture
typically describes

00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:54.280
very expensive objects
that are constructed

00:20:54.280 --> 00:20:56.900
at the behest of elite clients.

00:20:56.900 --> 00:21:00.250
And then, there's
everything else.

00:21:00.250 --> 00:21:04.540
That's Detroit,
by the way, which

00:21:04.540 --> 00:21:07.270
looks more typically
like what you see here.

00:21:07.270 --> 00:21:09.640
Not architecture,
but just building

00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:12.040
or even just construction.

00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:13.930
In these parts of the
environment, which

00:21:13.930 --> 00:21:16.480
is most of the
built environment,

00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:20.470
design and quality construction
is much less highly prized,

00:21:20.470 --> 00:21:23.260
if it's prized at all.

00:21:23.260 --> 00:21:25.540
Most of what exists in
our built environments

00:21:25.540 --> 00:21:29.080
is not really designed,
it's just built.

00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:31.000
But what we know
now and are learning

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:33.610
about the built environment's
profound but mostly

00:21:33.610 --> 00:21:38.320
nonconscious effects on how
we think and feel and so on,

00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:42.490
suggests that even the most
elementary and simple projects

00:21:42.490 --> 00:21:45.370
would serve people
better if they were more

00:21:45.370 --> 00:21:48.790
thoughtfully designed and
more carefully constructed

00:21:48.790 --> 00:21:52.060
using the knowledge that we
now have about human cognition

00:21:52.060 --> 00:21:53.450
and experience.

00:21:53.450 --> 00:21:56.930
There's no split between
architecture and building.

00:21:56.930 --> 00:22:01.130
It's all architecture
and it all matters.

00:22:01.130 --> 00:22:03.290
And when it comes to
the built environment,

00:22:03.290 --> 00:22:05.530
there's no such
thing as neutral.

00:22:05.530 --> 00:22:11.410
If a building or a streetscape
or an urban plaza or green area

00:22:11.410 --> 00:22:16.120
isn't helping you,
chances are it's not

00:22:16.120 --> 00:22:18.550
doing good things to you.

00:22:18.550 --> 00:22:20.650
I can't say it's
literally hurting you.

00:22:20.650 --> 00:22:25.300
In some cases, it certainly
is, but they're not neutral.

00:22:25.300 --> 00:22:26.365
None of it is neutral.

00:22:31.130 --> 00:22:36.490
So we need to start thinking
about the built environment

00:22:36.490 --> 00:22:43.670
as is it enriching us or is it
impoverishing our experience?

00:22:43.670 --> 00:22:47.410
And I use the word "enriching"
for a specific reason.

00:22:47.410 --> 00:22:50.470
It also comes from science.

00:22:50.470 --> 00:22:54.040
And there's abundant
scientific evidence

00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:57.820
that when people inhabit
enriching environments that

00:22:57.820 --> 00:23:00.670
engage them motorically,
that give them

00:23:00.670 --> 00:23:02.590
a lot of different
things to do, that

00:23:02.590 --> 00:23:05.400
give them a lot of different
ways to imagine themselves--

00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:08.350
I'll explain more about
this in a minute--

00:23:08.350 --> 00:23:11.950
they literally
grow better brains.

00:23:11.950 --> 00:23:15.070
They have dendrites
with more branches.

00:23:15.070 --> 00:23:21.317
A higher density and complexity
of synaptic connections.

00:23:21.317 --> 00:23:22.900
So what does all of
this mean in terms

00:23:22.900 --> 00:23:27.140
of what should be done
differently in terms of design?

00:23:27.140 --> 00:23:31.690
Compare this playground,
which is Stavanger, Norway,

00:23:31.690 --> 00:23:34.990
to the ordinary
playground that you

00:23:34.990 --> 00:23:39.980
take your kid to when you don't
have time to go anywhere else.

00:23:39.980 --> 00:23:42.640
Among this thing
that this new way

00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:44.140
of thinking about
human experiences

00:23:44.140 --> 00:23:46.270
and embodied
cognition tells us is

00:23:46.270 --> 00:23:49.840
that the way a place
looks to our eyes

00:23:49.840 --> 00:23:53.860
is only a very
small part of what

00:23:53.860 --> 00:23:58.670
makes it an enriched or
enriching environment.

00:23:58.670 --> 00:24:00.820
Now, I'm going to step
back for a minute.

00:24:00.820 --> 00:24:05.260
If you think of cognition
the way that most people--

00:24:05.260 --> 00:24:07.660
what I call the folk
model of cognition--

00:24:07.660 --> 00:24:11.020
the way most people think about
thinking or analyze thinking.

00:24:11.020 --> 00:24:14.020
You think, I get all
the sensory input,

00:24:14.020 --> 00:24:16.600
and it comes from all these
different sensory portals.

00:24:16.600 --> 00:24:20.020
And then, I process it, and I
use my memories and experience

00:24:20.020 --> 00:24:21.165
of other places.

00:24:21.165 --> 00:24:24.130
And then it becomes
an experience.

00:24:24.130 --> 00:24:29.170
It turns out, that's really
not how we understand

00:24:29.170 --> 00:24:31.570
the places that we are.

00:24:31.570 --> 00:24:37.720
It's a much more complex process
that involves not just vision,

00:24:37.720 --> 00:24:40.690
although our brain
does privilege vision,

00:24:40.690 --> 00:24:44.470
but auditory stimulation
is incredibly important.

00:24:44.470 --> 00:24:47.920
Tactile stimulation is
incredibly important.

00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:50.950
And, in fact, one of
the things I really love

00:24:50.950 --> 00:24:55.000
is that you don't
need to actually touch

00:24:55.000 --> 00:25:01.390
surfaces to have them
activate your tactile sensory

00:25:01.390 --> 00:25:02.370
perceptions.

00:25:02.370 --> 00:25:04.810
All you need to
do is look at them

00:25:04.810 --> 00:25:07.940
and you imagine what it
feels like to touch them.

00:25:07.940 --> 00:25:10.390
So surfaces and
textures and colors

00:25:10.390 --> 00:25:13.540
are really, really important
in ways that, I think,

00:25:13.540 --> 00:25:15.630
have not really been recognized.

00:25:20.590 --> 00:25:22.720
The other new
finding is that our

00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:26.710
built environmental cognitions
are not only multi-sensory,

00:25:26.710 --> 00:25:31.300
so looking at a surface
actually activates

00:25:31.300 --> 00:25:35.470
neurons in our brain
associated with vision.

00:25:35.470 --> 00:25:38.690
That's multi-sensory.

00:25:38.690 --> 00:25:41.140
It's not only
multi-sensory, but what also

00:25:41.140 --> 00:25:43.420
is called multi-modal
which means

00:25:43.420 --> 00:25:49.050
that sensory perception is
always preparation for action.

00:25:49.050 --> 00:25:52.090
Your motor neurons are involved

00:25:52.090 --> 00:25:54.490
So I look at that
window and I imagine,

00:25:54.490 --> 00:25:56.560
could that window open?

00:25:56.560 --> 00:25:57.550
Does it open that way?

00:25:57.550 --> 00:25:59.350
Does it open this
way or whatever?

00:25:59.350 --> 00:26:01.390
Or I imagine sitting
on the chair.

00:26:01.390 --> 00:26:01.910
Is it hard?

00:26:01.910 --> 00:26:03.670
Is it soft?

00:26:03.670 --> 00:26:06.580
Our motor systems
are involved when

00:26:06.580 --> 00:26:09.190
we're in the built environment.

00:26:09.190 --> 00:26:11.830
So in terms of this
playground, that's

00:26:11.830 --> 00:26:15.340
why just looking at
all those orange balls

00:26:15.340 --> 00:26:19.330
can inspire in us a sense
of playful buoyancy.

00:26:19.330 --> 00:26:23.350
Because you think, wow, bouncing
on those balls, that'd be cool.

00:26:23.350 --> 00:26:25.240
So enriched
environments give people

00:26:25.240 --> 00:26:30.280
many, many different kinds of
opportunities to engage in them

00:26:30.280 --> 00:26:34.000
and to imagine engaging in them,
even if they don't actually

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:35.500
engage in them.

00:26:35.500 --> 00:26:38.590
And they stimulate not just
our visual system, but also

00:26:38.590 --> 00:26:42.400
our sense of touch,
hearing, movement, and more.

00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:47.680
So you look at this
surface here and you

00:26:47.680 --> 00:26:51.700
can imagine what it feels like
to walk on top of that surface.

00:26:51.700 --> 00:26:53.830
And this playground,
which, by the way,

00:26:53.830 --> 00:26:58.420
I think is incredibly
cool, uses these old--

00:26:58.420 --> 00:27:01.860
everything here is recycled
materials, by the way.

00:27:01.860 --> 00:27:06.130
It has sound components so
that you can bounce sound off

00:27:06.130 --> 00:27:08.240
and then you can hear
it like 30 feet away

00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:09.740
on the other side
of the playground.

00:27:09.740 --> 00:27:11.230
It's full of a
lot of cool stuff.

00:27:15.130 --> 00:27:23.650
So this is the moment when I've
given such, yay, design matters

00:27:23.650 --> 00:27:29.490
talks that someone
goes wait at minute.

00:27:29.490 --> 00:27:32.710
Isn't that really expensive?

00:27:32.710 --> 00:27:34.910
We can't always
afford to do that.

00:27:34.910 --> 00:27:39.940
In fact, I was giving a lecture
in rural Arkansas at one point

00:27:39.940 --> 00:27:43.840
and I gave my little spiel.

00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:48.760
And hand shoots up right
afterwards and says,

00:27:48.760 --> 00:27:50.980
we're building a
post office in town.

00:27:50.980 --> 00:27:52.630
Now that's a public
building, which

00:27:52.630 --> 00:27:56.560
means it has to be functional
and it has to be inexpensive,

00:27:56.560 --> 00:28:01.420
so what can you tell me about
design for that building?

00:28:01.420 --> 00:28:04.850
So I wrote a whole book
to try and answer that.

00:28:11.050 --> 00:28:14.440
As I said, there isn't a
divide between architecture

00:28:14.440 --> 00:28:17.590
and building, it's
all architecture.

00:28:17.590 --> 00:28:21.520
And if you have a tight
budget, don't the services

00:28:21.520 --> 00:28:23.530
of a designer just add costs?

00:28:23.530 --> 00:28:27.670
Not necessarily and
not if done well.

00:28:27.670 --> 00:28:30.670
At pretty much any
level of investment,

00:28:30.670 --> 00:28:34.930
you can purchase better
design or worse design.

00:28:34.930 --> 00:28:37.340
Put in another way--

00:28:37.340 --> 00:28:40.210
and this actually sort of went
around Twitter the other day--

00:28:40.210 --> 00:28:43.720
it cost just as much money
to design a bad building

00:28:43.720 --> 00:28:46.360
as it does a good one.

00:28:46.360 --> 00:28:48.490
And so the examples
that I'm going

00:28:48.490 --> 00:28:50.800
to show you that embody
some of the principles I've

00:28:50.800 --> 00:28:53.530
been talking about
are where there

00:28:53.530 --> 00:28:57.240
has been virtually no budget
or a teeny, tiny budget.

00:28:57.240 --> 00:29:01.540
And the people have done
extraordinary things.

00:29:01.540 --> 00:29:03.670
What you're seeing
on the screen is

00:29:03.670 --> 00:29:08.350
in Port Elizabeth, South
Africa in one of the townships.

00:29:08.350 --> 00:29:10.600
It's a daycare
center and community

00:29:10.600 --> 00:29:15.910
center that is built entirely
of recycled and scavenged

00:29:15.910 --> 00:29:16.850
materials.

00:29:16.850 --> 00:29:21.280
So we have corrugated
plastic, wooden pallets,

00:29:21.280 --> 00:29:26.620
discarded lumber, discarded
tires, and scavenged bottles.

00:29:26.620 --> 00:29:30.700
It's a one room building with
the community constructed

00:29:30.700 --> 00:29:34.690
under the supervision of a
bunch of volunteer architects,

00:29:34.690 --> 00:29:36.520
basically.

00:29:36.520 --> 00:29:38.290
So I showed the
picture on the left

00:29:38.290 --> 00:29:40.949
just to show you
that's the setting.

00:29:40.949 --> 00:29:42.490
That's what everything
else around it

00:29:42.490 --> 00:29:47.410
looks like is these
corrugated, tin, little huts.

00:29:47.410 --> 00:29:51.490
But the designers managed
through really simple means

00:29:51.490 --> 00:29:54.820
to convey a sense of place
that dignifies the community

00:29:54.820 --> 00:29:58.120
and dignifies the people
who use it so have a look.

00:30:01.030 --> 00:30:03.540
One principle they used--

00:30:03.540 --> 00:30:05.080
let me just describe this.

00:30:05.080 --> 00:30:08.290
So these are just alternating
pieces of lumber--

00:30:08.290 --> 00:30:11.080
one placed this way,
one placed that way.

00:30:11.080 --> 00:30:11.740
That's it.

00:30:11.740 --> 00:30:13.660
Not that hard to do.

00:30:13.660 --> 00:30:16.150
These are the ends
of the bottles that

00:30:16.150 --> 00:30:19.570
were scavenged to
create this thing which

00:30:19.570 --> 00:30:22.660
is, as you can see on the
inside, a whole window a wall.

00:30:26.320 --> 00:30:28.510
The designers first
use the principle

00:30:28.510 --> 00:30:30.880
of patterned complexity.

00:30:30.880 --> 00:30:35.590
Humans are nothing if not
pattern-seeking creatures.

00:30:35.590 --> 00:30:38.620
That helps us comprehend our
environments really quickly

00:30:38.620 --> 00:30:39.790
and with minimal effort.

00:30:39.790 --> 00:30:43.840
We're always looking to
see what the pattern is.

00:30:43.840 --> 00:30:48.010
Patterns also reassure people
by giving them a sense of order.

00:30:48.010 --> 00:30:51.250
So I know I'm in a
controlled environment--

00:30:51.250 --> 00:30:53.290
there's a pattern here--

00:30:53.290 --> 00:30:56.830
and gives coherence to
a project of any scale.

00:30:56.830 --> 00:31:01.930
But we all know that
patterns on a large scale,

00:31:01.930 --> 00:31:04.540
even on a medium
scale, a pattern

00:31:04.540 --> 00:31:08.890
that lacks sufficient
complexity is boring.

00:31:08.890 --> 00:31:13.060
You see that a lot in
the built environment.

00:31:13.060 --> 00:31:15.800
That's part of the reason so
many people dislike modernism,

00:31:15.800 --> 00:31:17.470
but we won't go there.

00:31:17.470 --> 00:31:19.540
So in this building,
complexity is

00:31:19.540 --> 00:31:23.260
created by the unexpected use
of these scavenged and recycled

00:31:23.260 --> 00:31:26.320
bottles to create this
incredibly luminous,

00:31:26.320 --> 00:31:27.810
wonderful wall.

00:31:27.810 --> 00:31:30.490
There's multi-modal stimulation.

00:31:30.490 --> 00:31:32.800
In other words,
stimulation of our motor

00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:36.100
as well as our visual
and sensory neurons

00:31:36.100 --> 00:31:39.877
because we look at that wall
and we can imagine, particularly

00:31:39.877 --> 00:31:41.710
on the inside, you can
imagine what it feels

00:31:41.710 --> 00:31:44.200
like to hold onto that bottle.

00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:46.240
You've held on to
bottles like that.

00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:49.330
You've imagined what it's
like to have one in your hand.

00:31:49.330 --> 00:31:53.140
So it stimulates our imagination
and our motor neurons,

00:31:53.140 --> 00:31:55.370
our tactile engagement
with these services,

00:31:55.370 --> 00:31:56.560
even if we never touch them.

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:02.740
The bottles also,
obviously, introduce color

00:32:02.740 --> 00:32:05.600
and fill the interior with
a kind of diffused light.

00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:09.240
Remember, light is really
bright in South Africa.

00:32:09.240 --> 00:32:12.130
And that light
changes all day long

00:32:12.130 --> 00:32:16.900
and this really simple, one
room interior as the sun

00:32:16.900 --> 00:32:19.890
moves through the sky.

00:32:19.890 --> 00:32:23.670
So other details that I love.

00:32:23.670 --> 00:32:28.170
The windows are opened by this
very simple pulley system.

00:32:28.170 --> 00:32:32.380
So you think, open a window,
imagine just doing the pulley.

00:32:32.380 --> 00:32:34.440
It's easy.

00:32:34.440 --> 00:32:37.980
And they really had no
money, these architects,

00:32:37.980 --> 00:32:41.190
so they wanted to
create sliding doors

00:32:41.190 --> 00:32:43.080
so they could open it
out to the community.

00:32:43.080 --> 00:32:46.770
So what they did was
they got old skateboards

00:32:46.770 --> 00:32:49.050
and they used the wheels
in the skateboards

00:32:49.050 --> 00:32:52.120
to create the runners
to slide the doors.

00:32:52.120 --> 00:32:53.280
So that does two things.

00:32:53.280 --> 00:32:57.570
When you think wow, a
skateboard, that's a door.

00:32:57.570 --> 00:33:00.120
So it's a creative
transformation

00:33:00.120 --> 00:33:03.840
that carries some of the
meaning of the former use

00:33:03.840 --> 00:33:06.630
of that object, the
skateboard, into and creates

00:33:06.630 --> 00:33:08.280
a kind of sense of playfulness.

00:33:11.180 --> 00:33:15.250
So you might say, well,
that's South Africa.

00:33:15.250 --> 00:33:17.930
The United States is a
bit more complicated.

00:33:17.930 --> 00:33:21.860
Well, no, it's really not.

00:33:21.860 --> 00:33:24.650
In fact, the lecture that
I was giving in Arkansas

00:33:24.650 --> 00:33:28.860
was the same time I
saw this building.

00:33:28.860 --> 00:33:31.280
So this is rural Arkansas--

00:33:31.280 --> 00:33:34.370
house here, little
shed-y thing here.

00:33:34.370 --> 00:33:36.740
And I want you to focus on
that building right there.

00:33:42.940 --> 00:33:47.100
That's a Russian Orthodox
Church in Springdale, Arkansas.

00:33:49.630 --> 00:33:53.620
It's in as vernacular
detritus-filled landscape

00:33:53.620 --> 00:33:55.990
as you could possibly imagine.

00:33:55.990 --> 00:33:57.820
So the congregation
for this church

00:33:57.820 --> 00:34:01.270
had no money, certainly not
enough to build a new building.

00:34:04.110 --> 00:34:08.270
So they settled for a three-car
garage, which they bought.

00:34:08.270 --> 00:34:10.219
And they hired a
local architect named

00:34:10.219 --> 00:34:12.409
[? Marlon ?] Blackwell to
redesign it and make it

00:34:12.409 --> 00:34:14.630
into a church.

00:34:14.630 --> 00:34:18.110
So Blackwell used very
simple, very inexpensive

00:34:18.110 --> 00:34:21.320
materials, basically
Home Depot kind of stuff

00:34:21.320 --> 00:34:25.130
like this box metal facade.

00:34:25.130 --> 00:34:29.090
But he took the principles
of human pattern seeking

00:34:29.090 --> 00:34:32.389
and people's proclivity
to be drawn to landscapes

00:34:32.389 --> 00:34:35.783
of patterned
complexity, and he also

00:34:35.783 --> 00:34:37.699
used color, which I'll
talk about in a minute,

00:34:37.699 --> 00:34:41.840
to create an absolute
jewel of a building.

00:34:41.840 --> 00:34:46.070
He wrapped the entire
facade in this sturdy box

00:34:46.070 --> 00:34:50.900
corrugated metal and lined every
edge, windows, top, bottom,

00:34:50.900 --> 00:34:55.190
and so on, in black
to create a crisp.

00:34:55.190 --> 00:34:59.540
This is a constructed building.

00:34:59.540 --> 00:35:02.120
All you need really
is that black edge

00:35:02.120 --> 00:35:04.790
and you go oh,
wait, that doesn't

00:35:04.790 --> 00:35:09.710
look like every other corrugated
metal facade building I see.

00:35:09.710 --> 00:35:11.637
He also floated it--

00:35:11.637 --> 00:35:13.220
you can't really see
it in the image--

00:35:13.220 --> 00:35:16.250
but these are all blackstones.

00:35:16.250 --> 00:35:19.220
And so he stopped
the corrugated metal

00:35:19.220 --> 00:35:24.590
about that far off the ground
and then, poured blackstones so

00:35:24.590 --> 00:35:27.980
that makes the building
appear to float.

00:35:27.980 --> 00:35:29.540
It's a church.

00:35:29.540 --> 00:35:35.030
So it just creates a
little bit of specialness.

00:35:35.030 --> 00:35:37.910
And then he placed the windows--

00:35:37.910 --> 00:35:39.500
one, two, three
and then, I'll talk

00:35:39.500 --> 00:35:41.030
about the cross in a second--

00:35:41.030 --> 00:35:44.720
in really unexpected locations.

00:35:44.720 --> 00:35:49.220
So to break this
repetitive striated pattern

00:35:49.220 --> 00:35:52.910
in a way that captures our
attention go oh, well, wait,

00:35:52.910 --> 00:35:54.590
what is that?

00:35:54.590 --> 00:35:58.980
And then you have the
suggestion of the cross.

00:35:58.980 --> 00:36:03.910
He glazed the windows with
different colored glass, red,

00:36:03.910 --> 00:36:08.100
blue, yellow, and so on
in this tiny building--

00:36:08.100 --> 00:36:10.770
it's a tiny building--

00:36:10.770 --> 00:36:15.090
to create a different
emotional atmosphere wherever

00:36:15.090 --> 00:36:16.350
you are in the building.

00:36:16.350 --> 00:36:20.130
He also-- what you're seeing
on the top left hand side,

00:36:20.130 --> 00:36:25.320
and he used to paint so
colored glass and paint.

00:36:25.320 --> 00:36:28.620
So in this image,
that's the cross that

00:36:28.620 --> 00:36:31.040
has red colored glass on it.

00:36:31.040 --> 00:36:33.030
And then from this
tower, he just

00:36:33.030 --> 00:36:37.710
basically painted it
with this red paint

00:36:37.710 --> 00:36:43.650
to create this incredibly
red luminous interior.

00:36:43.650 --> 00:36:48.150
He mostly edited out your views
of the surrounding landscape

00:36:48.150 --> 00:36:50.580
because we saw what the
surrounding landscape looks,

00:36:50.580 --> 00:36:52.380
like not exactly
something that makes

00:36:52.380 --> 00:36:55.170
you feel spiritually
uplifted, but it gives you

00:36:55.170 --> 00:36:55.980
views of the sky.

00:36:58.870 --> 00:37:00.840
So it's such a smart design.

00:37:04.350 --> 00:37:06.630
So you proceed from
the front entrance,

00:37:06.630 --> 00:37:13.080
which is over here, along
the short hallway which,

00:37:13.080 --> 00:37:17.921
during services, has candles lit
as they do in Russian Orthodox

00:37:17.921 --> 00:37:18.420
faith.

00:37:18.420 --> 00:37:21.820
So you're already getting
prepared for the mood.

00:37:21.820 --> 00:37:26.010
Then you stand in
this light-filled,

00:37:26.010 --> 00:37:31.110
red-filled space as the
transitional moment--

00:37:31.110 --> 00:37:34.920
this is a small hallway
we're talking about--

00:37:34.920 --> 00:37:38.130
before you enter into
the sanctuary space.

00:37:38.130 --> 00:37:40.490
And that is, by the
way, natural light

00:37:40.490 --> 00:37:44.267
that is slotted in through
a skylight at the end.

00:37:44.267 --> 00:37:46.350
But you don't know where
the light is coming from,

00:37:46.350 --> 00:37:47.595
creates a sense of mystery.

00:37:50.820 --> 00:37:53.190
So we have craftsmanship.

00:37:53.190 --> 00:37:55.180
We have the use of color.

00:37:55.180 --> 00:38:00.960
We have a very carefully
sequenced spatial procession.

00:38:00.960 --> 00:38:03.870
We have a relationship
of interior

00:38:03.870 --> 00:38:07.150
to exterior that's very
thoughtfully managed.

00:38:07.150 --> 00:38:08.400
Pattern complexity.

00:38:08.400 --> 00:38:11.790
And all of this comes
together to create this really

00:38:11.790 --> 00:38:14.820
distinctive, peaceful place.

00:38:14.820 --> 00:38:18.690
Now this is one of my favorite
parts of this little church.

00:38:18.690 --> 00:38:21.060
So it's a Russian
Orthodox congregation.

00:38:21.060 --> 00:38:23.460
They really wanted a dome.

00:38:23.460 --> 00:38:27.840
They didn't have money to
build the dome, not even a cent

00:38:27.840 --> 00:38:29.160
to build the dome.

00:38:29.160 --> 00:38:30.780
So what did Blackwell do?

00:38:30.780 --> 00:38:35.850
He found an old
discarded satellite dish

00:38:35.850 --> 00:38:38.130
and he struck it in
the ceiling and he had

00:38:38.130 --> 00:38:42.180
someone paint a painting on it.

00:38:42.180 --> 00:38:46.500
So does good design
have to cost money?

00:38:46.500 --> 00:38:48.500
No.

00:38:48.500 --> 00:38:50.730
And the other thing
the satellite dish does

00:38:50.730 --> 00:38:53.370
is that it reflects
the sound back

00:38:53.370 --> 00:38:57.340
and so it improves the acoustics
of the space quite a lot, too.

00:39:02.070 --> 00:39:08.640
So my parting words, the
design of the built environment

00:39:08.640 --> 00:39:11.700
is no discretionary luxury.

00:39:11.700 --> 00:39:17.070
It's central to human
well-being, to human health,

00:39:17.070 --> 00:39:21.700
to cognitive development,
and to social relations.

00:39:21.700 --> 00:39:25.260
It's not just architecture
versus building landscape

00:39:25.260 --> 00:39:27.360
architecture versus voids.

00:39:27.360 --> 00:39:30.510
Our built environments
are habitats,

00:39:30.510 --> 00:39:34.620
and it all can be better
designed or worse designed.

00:39:34.620 --> 00:39:37.740
And so this is the
last way we need

00:39:37.740 --> 00:39:40.080
to change how we think
about the built environment.

00:39:40.080 --> 00:39:44.310
Instead of asking, as so
many architecture critics

00:39:44.310 --> 00:39:50.850
or other people or
laypeople do, do I like it?

00:39:50.850 --> 00:39:52.110
Is it to my taste?

00:39:52.110 --> 00:39:53.580
Is it any good?

00:39:53.580 --> 00:39:55.560
You can ask all those
questions, that's fine,

00:39:55.560 --> 00:40:01.800
but we also need to be asking a
different set of questions that

00:40:01.800 --> 00:40:04.080
are actually more
important, which

00:40:04.080 --> 00:40:08.490
is, where and with what
means can we create

00:40:08.490 --> 00:40:11.430
more enriching environments?

00:40:11.430 --> 00:40:12.870
And how?

00:40:12.870 --> 00:40:14.306
Thank you.

00:40:14.306 --> 00:40:16.671
[APPLAUSE]

00:40:19.754 --> 00:40:20.920
SPEAKER 1: Thank you, Sarah.

00:40:20.920 --> 00:40:22.128
I'm going to kick things off.

00:40:22.128 --> 00:40:23.970
I have a quick question
and then, obviously,

00:40:23.970 --> 00:40:25.386
if we have any
audience questions,

00:40:25.386 --> 00:40:27.810
we can flip over
to that as well.

00:40:27.810 --> 00:40:30.000
In your book, which I
read-- which is fantastic,

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:31.740
by the way--

00:40:31.740 --> 00:40:36.210
you say that much of our built
world can and has to be remade.

00:40:36.210 --> 00:40:38.790
We have before us an
unprecedented opportunity

00:40:38.790 --> 00:40:41.310
to reshape the world
into a better place.

00:40:41.310 --> 00:40:43.415
And, again, we talked
at lunch beforehand,

00:40:43.415 --> 00:40:45.540
one of the reasons we wanted
you to come to Detroit

00:40:45.540 --> 00:40:47.623
was to talk a little bit
about the city of Detroit

00:40:47.623 --> 00:40:52.050
because we do have a fantastic
opportunity to really rebuild

00:40:52.050 --> 00:40:54.030
a city that people
actually live in,

00:40:54.030 --> 00:40:55.830
kind of from scratch almost.

00:40:55.830 --> 00:40:57.870
What's your advice for
a city like Detroit

00:40:57.870 --> 00:41:01.830
to take some of the principles
that you discussed previously

00:41:01.830 --> 00:41:04.620
in the presentation S
apply it to this rebuilding

00:41:04.620 --> 00:41:10.020
and revitalization of a
giant metropolitan area?

00:41:10.020 --> 00:41:12.210
SARAH WILLIAMS GOLDHAGEN:
A few things, one,

00:41:12.210 --> 00:41:16.920
they should read my book,
but more important-- well,

00:41:16.920 --> 00:41:26.210
that's important, but don't be
seduced by this architecture

00:41:26.210 --> 00:41:28.290
versus building divide.

00:41:28.290 --> 00:41:33.050
Don't think so if we invest
in these big iconic things,

00:41:33.050 --> 00:41:36.500
then that'll help and
attract attention to so on.

00:41:40.130 --> 00:41:41.420
Big iconic things are fine.

00:41:41.420 --> 00:41:44.570
I have no problem with
big iconic things,

00:41:44.570 --> 00:41:51.690
but investing in design at
all levels is important.

00:41:51.690 --> 00:41:54.350
But it's not just that, I'm
not saying that architects

00:41:54.350 --> 00:41:57.680
are heroes because
a lot of architects

00:41:57.680 --> 00:41:59.510
are not really trained
in the principles

00:41:59.510 --> 00:42:02.000
that I'm laying out here and
that I lay out in the book.

00:42:04.620 --> 00:42:06.140
Because of
postmodernism, because

00:42:06.140 --> 00:42:09.120
of a whole lot of
different things,

00:42:09.120 --> 00:42:12.560
basically, the mantra
among architects

00:42:12.560 --> 00:42:17.000
is you can't really
predict people's experience

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:18.400
of an environment.

00:42:18.400 --> 00:42:19.850
We don't know enough.

00:42:19.850 --> 00:42:21.740
It's all subjective.

00:42:21.740 --> 00:42:27.810
French people experience it
differently from Americans.

00:42:27.810 --> 00:42:29.390
No.

00:42:29.390 --> 00:42:31.370
There's a lot we know.

00:42:31.370 --> 00:42:35.510
And that knowledge should
become much more widespread,

00:42:35.510 --> 00:42:38.330
and should be
incorporated into what

00:42:38.330 --> 00:42:43.250
clients expect from the
designers that they hire.

00:42:43.250 --> 00:42:46.400
And that means
looking to fields that

00:42:46.400 --> 00:42:52.130
are not necessarily directly
connected to architecture

00:42:52.130 --> 00:42:54.517
like environmental
psychology and so on.

00:42:54.517 --> 00:42:56.600
And there are architecture
firms that are actually

00:42:56.600 --> 00:42:58.520
putting environmental
psychologists,

00:42:58.520 --> 00:43:02.900
and cognitive scientists,
and so on on staff.

00:43:02.900 --> 00:43:08.430
So get the right stuff,
that would be my advice.

00:43:08.430 --> 00:43:09.900
SPEAKER 1: One
other question, too.

00:43:09.900 --> 00:43:12.230
You focus a lot on
education in the book

00:43:12.230 --> 00:43:14.990
and you mentioned it in
the presentation as well,

00:43:14.990 --> 00:43:18.380
how it relates to
performance and creativity

00:43:18.380 --> 00:43:20.120
and things like that.

00:43:20.120 --> 00:43:24.026
I find it interesting, you've
got on one end of the scale

00:43:24.026 --> 00:43:25.400
when children are
very young, you

00:43:25.400 --> 00:43:28.910
go into most modern
daycares or kindergartens,

00:43:28.910 --> 00:43:30.980
and there's lots
of natural light.

00:43:30.980 --> 00:43:33.390
There's lots of
soft, round surfaces.

00:43:33.390 --> 00:43:35.420
Some of that for
safety, of course.

00:43:35.420 --> 00:43:37.400
But lots of bright
primary colors.

00:43:37.400 --> 00:43:41.000
Lots of fun, interactive,
creative things

00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:43.310
that these children
could play with.

00:43:43.310 --> 00:43:45.150
And kids obviously
develop and it

00:43:45.150 --> 00:43:46.400
seems like a really fun place.

00:43:46.400 --> 00:43:47.316
I've got two children.

00:43:47.316 --> 00:43:50.420
I go to their daycare, and
I'm automatically happy.

00:43:50.420 --> 00:43:52.640
As you progress through
your educational career,

00:43:52.640 --> 00:43:55.370
you go into colleges,
most universities,

00:43:55.370 --> 00:43:58.340
you go into a big
lecture hall, and it's

00:43:58.340 --> 00:44:02.810
cream colored,
white, hard chairs,

00:44:02.810 --> 00:44:07.130
very boring, very
non-traditional in terms

00:44:07.130 --> 00:44:10.790
of a place of
education and learning.

00:44:10.790 --> 00:44:11.780
How does that happen?

00:44:11.780 --> 00:44:14.630
How do we go from getting
it so right at a young age

00:44:14.630 --> 00:44:18.044
to completely losing
this vision of design

00:44:18.044 --> 00:44:20.210
and the built environment
when it comes to colleges?

00:44:20.210 --> 00:44:22.920
I know that there's
history there,

00:44:22.920 --> 00:44:25.790
a lot of these universities
were built 100 years ago,

00:44:25.790 --> 00:44:28.280
if not longer, but there's
still a lot of modern buildings

00:44:28.280 --> 00:44:31.370
that we're building, especially
in the educational field, that

00:44:31.370 --> 00:44:32.510
have these same issues.

00:44:32.510 --> 00:44:34.010
How do we bridge that gap?

00:44:34.010 --> 00:44:36.247
Where did we lose sight
of that design process?

00:44:36.247 --> 00:44:38.330
SARAH WILLIAMS GOLDHAGEN:
Well, I made a reference

00:44:38.330 --> 00:44:39.710
before to modernism.

00:44:39.710 --> 00:44:41.420
I said this is why
a lot of people

00:44:41.420 --> 00:44:43.970
hate modernism because
it's so repetitive.

00:44:46.880 --> 00:44:49.100
Most of the stuff that
I'm talking about,

00:44:49.100 --> 00:44:54.590
people just didn't know
15 years ago, a lot of it.

00:44:54.590 --> 00:45:02.435
And so most of those spaces
were built with the neutral,

00:45:02.435 --> 00:45:05.255
the environment as stage
set-- the built environment

00:45:05.255 --> 00:45:09.080
as stage set model where the
environments themselves weren't

00:45:09.080 --> 00:45:11.120
going to help people learn.

00:45:11.120 --> 00:45:13.290
But we know that's not true.

00:45:13.290 --> 00:45:15.080
And actually, I think
you may be referring

00:45:15.080 --> 00:45:18.230
to one example I gave in a book
which is actually a study done

00:45:18.230 --> 00:45:21.080
on college students
where they put college

00:45:21.080 --> 00:45:24.680
students in a typical
classroom with linoleum

00:45:24.680 --> 00:45:28.017
floors, and hard metal
desks, and some blackboard,

00:45:28.017 --> 00:45:28.850
and stuff like that.

00:45:28.850 --> 00:45:32.090
And they seated them
in a circle and so on.

00:45:32.090 --> 00:45:33.110
So they-- I don't know.

00:45:33.110 --> 00:45:35.252
I can't remember the
details of the study,

00:45:35.252 --> 00:45:37.460
but it was something like
they did two weeks of class

00:45:37.460 --> 00:45:38.360
in that classroom.

00:45:38.360 --> 00:45:44.120
And then, they did another two
weeks in a similar classroom

00:45:44.120 --> 00:45:49.890
in terms of size and orientation
and arrangement of furniture.

00:45:49.890 --> 00:45:52.700
But the furniture was soft.

00:45:52.700 --> 00:45:54.830
And there were
rugs on the floor.

00:45:54.830 --> 00:45:56.390
And there were task lights.

00:45:56.390 --> 00:45:59.150
And there was a
couch behind them.

00:45:59.150 --> 00:46:03.200
And the students participated
something astonishingly,

00:46:03.200 --> 00:46:08.300
like 40% more and
were more engaged

00:46:08.300 --> 00:46:11.060
and therefore learn
more in what was

00:46:11.060 --> 00:46:14.510
the so-called soft classroom
than in the hard classroom.

00:46:14.510 --> 00:46:15.680
People just don't know.

00:46:15.680 --> 00:46:17.340
They don't know
these things matter.

00:46:17.340 --> 00:46:19.010
And part of the reason
that people don't really

00:46:19.010 --> 00:46:20.676
appreciate the build
environment so much

00:46:20.676 --> 00:46:24.680
is because most of our
thoughts are nonconscious

00:46:24.680 --> 00:46:29.210
and the built environment
is inert and static,

00:46:29.210 --> 00:46:31.306
and so you don't pay a
lot of attention to it,

00:46:31.306 --> 00:46:33.180
but that doesn't mean
it's not affecting you.

00:46:46.661 --> 00:46:48.160
SPEAKER 1: Have you
seen any studies

00:46:48.160 --> 00:46:51.650
that show how
people develop maybe

00:46:51.650 --> 00:46:55.610
in more of a city versus a
suburb versus the country?

00:46:55.610 --> 00:46:59.650
Or I'm sure there's no average
American city or suburb

00:46:59.650 --> 00:47:02.830
or country, so to speak,
but in the same way

00:47:02.830 --> 00:47:07.620
that you're talking about how
certain buildings are designed,

00:47:07.620 --> 00:47:10.240
have you expanded it more
on a macro level and just

00:47:10.240 --> 00:47:12.670
to kind of understand how
people develop in those three

00:47:12.670 --> 00:47:13.812
types of environments?

00:47:13.812 --> 00:47:15.270
SARAH WILLIAMS
GOLDHAGEN: Oh, sure.

00:47:15.270 --> 00:47:18.250
Absolutely.

00:47:18.250 --> 00:47:21.520
I tend to emphasize it
less because, particularly

00:47:21.520 --> 00:47:26.860
the suburb versus city, is a
pretty well-known comparison.

00:47:26.860 --> 00:47:30.720
Suburbs are very isolating,
and they're very homogeneous.

00:47:30.720 --> 00:47:37.690
And cities are like
beehives of diversity.

00:47:37.690 --> 00:47:40.480
They're different people and
there's different things to do.

00:47:43.810 --> 00:47:49.240
So you tend, in a suburb, to
get a very homogenized view

00:47:49.240 --> 00:47:51.220
of your social world.

00:47:51.220 --> 00:47:54.250
And also, there are times--

00:47:54.250 --> 00:47:56.350
I wouldn't say this
to my husband--

00:47:56.350 --> 00:47:59.770
but there are times when I
think the nuclear family is

00:47:59.770 --> 00:48:03.624
about the worst thing that
modern society has given us.

00:48:03.624 --> 00:48:05.540
There are other times
when I think it's great.

00:48:05.540 --> 00:48:14.320
But kids that grow up with
more than two role models,

00:48:14.320 --> 00:48:18.160
if you hate your dad, you
like your uncle or stuff

00:48:18.160 --> 00:48:20.770
where they're just more
people around and more

00:48:20.770 --> 00:48:23.140
internet communities--

00:48:23.140 --> 00:48:25.390
we know this-- are
psychologically much

00:48:25.390 --> 00:48:27.490
healthier kids.

00:48:27.490 --> 00:48:31.330
So there's definitely a big
urban dimension to this.

00:48:31.330 --> 00:48:36.970
So much so, the configuration
of the streetscape

00:48:36.970 --> 00:48:40.670
can either encourage people
to connect with one another.

00:48:40.670 --> 00:48:42.970
To look at each other.

00:48:42.970 --> 00:48:47.440
Or to put their eyes down and
just look at the sidewalk.

00:48:47.440 --> 00:48:49.840
There's a ream of stuff
out there about this.

00:48:53.019 --> 00:48:54.560
AUDIENCE: Sarah,
thanks for the talk.

00:48:54.560 --> 00:48:55.601
Really interesting stuff.

00:48:55.601 --> 00:48:58.700
I have not read your book, but
I do have a question for you.

00:48:58.700 --> 00:48:59.780
It seems as though--

00:48:59.780 --> 00:49:01.490
my understanding of
one of the hurdles

00:49:01.490 --> 00:49:03.610
to getting great
design more ubiquitous,

00:49:03.610 --> 00:49:05.570
whether it's in the
United States or globally,

00:49:05.570 --> 00:49:09.950
is this understanding
of the value gap.

00:49:09.950 --> 00:49:11.540
And I think the way
I would describe

00:49:11.540 --> 00:49:15.140
it is that the economic
costs are easily understood,

00:49:15.140 --> 00:49:17.000
and they're written
in economic terms,

00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:20.060
and they're easy to
measure, essentially.

00:49:20.060 --> 00:49:22.100
And then the value
component to great design

00:49:22.100 --> 00:49:25.040
is often talked about in
terms of enrichment and things

00:49:25.040 --> 00:49:27.200
that are not
economically defined.

00:49:27.200 --> 00:49:30.280
Do you have any
examples, whether be they

00:49:30.280 --> 00:49:33.980
public or private
projects, where

00:49:33.980 --> 00:49:36.740
folks have done a really
good job of economically

00:49:36.740 --> 00:49:39.306
defining the value proposition
of doing greater design?

00:49:39.306 --> 00:49:41.055
SARAH WILLIAMS GOLDHAGEN:
Absolutely, yes.

00:49:43.700 --> 00:49:47.210
Post-occupancy evaluation
is what it's called,

00:49:47.210 --> 00:49:50.030
and it's something that
architects are still

00:49:50.030 --> 00:49:52.520
having trouble with
because it kind of holds

00:49:52.520 --> 00:49:54.020
them accountable
in ways they wish

00:49:54.020 --> 00:49:56.510
they weren't held accountable.

00:49:56.510 --> 00:49:59.270
But there are
post-occupancy evaluations.

00:49:59.270 --> 00:50:00.860
I can think of two.

00:50:00.860 --> 00:50:06.260
One is a retail
supermarket in which

00:50:06.260 --> 00:50:12.410
they were in a big boxy type
space, no natural light.

00:50:12.410 --> 00:50:14.420
And then they moved into
a different building

00:50:14.420 --> 00:50:26.450
that had skylights, and 25%
to 35% more customers, a lot.

00:50:26.450 --> 00:50:32.030
A lot of studies have been
done on workplace productivity,

00:50:32.030 --> 00:50:34.790
including by people who had been
working on this for a long time

00:50:34.790 --> 00:50:37.010
and really know what they're
doing so the studies are

00:50:37.010 --> 00:50:42.650
excellent, in which
they show that employee

00:50:42.650 --> 00:50:45.079
retention, workplace
productivity, all these things

00:50:45.079 --> 00:50:45.870
have been measured.

00:50:45.870 --> 00:50:52.910
They go up dramatically in
better designed environments.

00:50:52.910 --> 00:50:54.660
So those are two
examples I can think of.

00:50:54.660 --> 00:50:56.030
There are others, too.

00:50:56.030 --> 00:50:58.732
There was-- actually,
it was in Michigan.

00:50:58.732 --> 00:51:04.460
It was a factory in Michigan
that they hired an architect

00:51:04.460 --> 00:51:06.860
who does a lot of green stuff.

00:51:06.860 --> 00:51:10.340
And he did a little bit like
that emergency department.

00:51:10.340 --> 00:51:12.860
He put these little
green moments

00:51:12.860 --> 00:51:14.720
all through the building.

00:51:14.720 --> 00:51:17.120
And, again,
productivity went up.

00:51:17.120 --> 00:51:18.380
People were happier.

00:51:18.380 --> 00:51:20.780
They stayed at the jobs
longer, et cetera, et cetera.

00:51:20.780 --> 00:51:23.750
So there are coming to be
more and more examples,

00:51:23.750 --> 00:51:28.340
and we need lot more
studies of that.

00:51:28.340 --> 00:51:30.890
SPEAKER 1: Well, hopefully
we see an evolution occurring

00:51:30.890 --> 00:51:33.290
right now and, again,
we hope Detroit

00:51:33.290 --> 00:51:35.810
is a landscape for a lot of
folks to come in and practice

00:51:35.810 --> 00:51:39.050
some of these design
efforts and expand upon some

00:51:39.050 --> 00:51:40.860
of the opportunity available.

00:51:40.860 --> 00:51:41.860
Thank you, again, Sarah.

00:51:41.860 --> 00:51:42.770
This was very interesting.

00:51:42.770 --> 00:51:43.769
We really appreciate it.

00:51:43.769 --> 00:51:45.530
Congratulations on the new book.

00:51:45.530 --> 00:51:48.416
Thank you, again, for joining
us for Talks at Google.

00:51:48.416 --> 00:51:49.790
One more quick
round of applause.

00:51:49.790 --> 00:51:51.522
[APPLAUSE]

00:51:52.201 --> 00:51:52.700
Thank you.

00:51:52.700 --> 00:51:54.630
SARAH WILLIAMS
GOLDHAGEN: Thank you.
