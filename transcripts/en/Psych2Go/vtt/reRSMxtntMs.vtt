00:00:05.755 --> 00:00:10.875
Do you ever wonder why some high school or college dropouts make it big out there,

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:13.520
but valedictorians rarely make history?

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:17.240
Intelligence is something that isn't always easily spotted

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:18.480
Sometimes,

00:00:18.485 --> 00:00:21.335
it means more than simply getting an A on a test,

00:00:21.335 --> 00:00:23.055
or receiving your diploma

00:00:23.545 --> 00:00:26.185
There's a difference between being a life-long learner,

00:00:26.185 --> 00:00:30.300
and jumping through the academic hoops just to get by in life

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.835
Wondering where you fall with your abilities?

00:00:32.835 --> 00:00:35.335
Here are five signs you're highly intelligent

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.740
1. You're not afraid to ask questions

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:42.960
Smart people rarely just follow the status quo without questioning it

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.435
In fact,

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.860
it's usually those that don't want to think, that they do what they're told

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:51.920
because asking the "why"s requires extra brain power

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.420
But if you've got a rebellious streak to you,

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.720
and you're curious about the world you live in,

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:59.800
then you might be smarter than you actually think you are!

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:04.800
Unfortunately, not every workplace or classroom nurtures this idea

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.080
In fact, some leaders enjoy feeling in control

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:10.620
by leading those who know less than them

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:14.240
Don't fall in this trap, and embrace your inquisitive nature

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.760
2. You tend to be self critical

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.920
Narcissists like to project their own reality onto others

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.140
and don't feel remorse when they lie to others

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:24.640
about how good they are at something

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:26.980
But intelligent people know how to

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:31.000
acknowledge their own faults, flaws, and weaknesses

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.320
Instead of trying to impress others with their abilities,

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.640
intelligent people can be quite humble and critique themselves,

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.880
often looking for ways to self-improve

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.760
3. You love projects!

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:46.480
Do you like reading up DIY ideas,

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.220
watching videos on new recipes,

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.480
or enjoy repairing your home?

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:53.200
People who are intelligent, love to keep busy

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.320
They rarely call it a day after they clock out from work

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:00.600
and enjoy immersing themselves with fun activities that boost their knowledge

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.400
Just like going to the gym for a physical workout,

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:06.500
smart people need their daily brain exercise

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.540
Whether it means learning a new language,

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:10.740
taking dance lessons,

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:12.140
or attending art classes

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.820
intelligent people know how to fill up their schedules and minds

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.035
4. You're messy

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.960
This is definitely one I can relate to

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:24.260
Do you have a messy room or workplace?

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.460
Turns out there's more going on than just clutter

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:32.440
According to a study published in Psychological Science by the University of Minnesota

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:37.480
48 participants were asked to come up with unusual uses for a ping pong ball

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.540
The 24 individuals working in neat rooms

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:43.040
came up with less creative responses

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.340
than those who worked in messy rooms

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:48.020
So the next time your mom scolds you for not making your bed,

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:50.660
let her know it's hurting your creativity

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.925
5. You don't think that you're smart

00:02:53.925 --> 00:02:55.600
This is called the Dunning Kruger Effect,

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:01.480
in which people with low level of competence tend to overestimate their ability

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:05.040
Whereas, highly competent individuals tend to sell themselves short

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:06.280
Why is this?

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:10.860
Intelligent people realize just how much room there is to improve

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:13.940
and they're never satisfied with their current knowledge level

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.800
Always hungry for more information,

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:20.480
their brain appetite grows with each new set of skills they pick up

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:23.720
Do you resonate with these signs?

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:29.280
Remember, intelligence doesn't have to be limited, unless you allow it

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:32.100
Everyone has the ability to grow
