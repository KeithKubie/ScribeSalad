00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.260
All we need to do here are figure out the coordinates of each of our points, and

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:10.447
then recognize that the horizontal one is a and the vertical one is b. So for

00:00:10.447 --> 00:00:15.567
example, we know that point a has the coordinates 3,5, so the complex point it

00:00:15.567 --> 00:00:20.436
represents is 3 plus 5i. Similarly b is 5+3i. Let's look at a point in a

00:00:20.436 --> 00:00:26.570
different quadrant, maybe point f over here. The coordinates of f are negative

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:31.557
5, negative 3, so that represents the number negative 5 minus 3i.
