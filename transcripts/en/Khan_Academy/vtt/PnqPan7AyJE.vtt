00:00:00.682 --> 00:00:01.515
- [Instructor] So we're asked,

00:00:01.515 --> 00:00:05.538
does the mean value theorem
apply to h over the interval?

00:00:05.538 --> 00:00:08.090
And they actually give us
four different intervals here.

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:09.634
So we should separately consider them.

00:00:09.634 --> 00:00:11.967
And this is the graph
of y is equal to h of x.

00:00:11.967 --> 00:00:13.268
So pause this video and see,

00:00:13.268 --> 00:00:15.288
does the mean value theorem apply to h

00:00:15.288 --> 00:00:18.871
over any or all or some
of these intervals?

00:00:19.908 --> 00:00:21.729
All right, now let's work
through this together.

00:00:21.729 --> 00:00:24.320
In other videos, if the
words mean value theorem

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:26.271
are completely unfamiliar to you,

00:00:26.271 --> 00:00:28.302
I encourage you to look
at the mean value theorem

00:00:28.302 --> 00:00:30.578
introduction, or the existence
theorem introductions

00:00:30.578 --> 00:00:31.890
on Khan Academy.

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.434
But as a review for those of you

00:00:33.434 --> 00:00:35.686
who are familiar with
the mean value theorem,

00:00:35.686 --> 00:00:37.126
the conditions are,

00:00:37.126 --> 00:00:39.564
if we're dealing with some closed interval

00:00:39.564 --> 00:00:40.564
from a to b,

00:00:41.526 --> 00:00:44.034
we have to be differentiable,

00:00:44.034 --> 00:00:45.474
all right, just diff,

00:00:45.474 --> 00:00:46.945
actually, I'll just write it out,

00:00:46.945 --> 00:00:48.112
differentiable

00:00:50.625 --> 00:00:54.294
over the open interval from a to b,

00:00:54.294 --> 00:00:56.627
and we have to be continuous

00:00:58.381 --> 00:01:01.464
over the closed interval from a to b.

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:04.151
Or another way to think about it,

00:01:04.151 --> 00:01:05.045
if you're differentiable,

00:01:05.045 --> 00:01:06.903
you're definitely going to be continuous.

00:01:06.903 --> 00:01:09.747
So, this second condition,

00:01:09.747 --> 00:01:11.465
just make sure that we're continuous

00:01:11.465 --> 00:01:14.578
at the endpoints of our closed interval.

00:01:14.578 --> 00:01:17.219
But if these conditions are met,

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:19.377
then the mean value theorem tells us,

00:01:19.377 --> 00:01:20.479
and I'll just visually draw it

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:22.245
because this is a review here.

00:01:22.245 --> 00:01:25.495
So let's say that this is our function.

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.156
So let's say our function looks like this,

00:01:29.156 --> 00:01:31.616
this is a and this is b,

00:01:31.616 --> 00:01:33.322
and let's say that we
meet these conditions

00:01:33.322 --> 00:01:34.454
over this interval,

00:01:34.454 --> 00:01:37.095
the mean value theorem tells us

00:01:37.095 --> 00:01:39.993
that there's going to be some value,

00:01:39.993 --> 00:01:41.849
let's call it c, in the interval,

00:01:41.849 --> 00:01:46.015
where the derivative of c is equal

00:01:46.015 --> 00:01:49.064
to the average rate of change from a to b.

00:01:49.064 --> 00:01:50.769
So the slope of the secant line

00:01:50.769 --> 00:01:53.018
is the average rate of change.

00:01:53.018 --> 00:01:54.286
And so you can see it visually,

00:01:54.286 --> 00:01:55.931
it looks like right about there,

00:01:55.931 --> 00:01:58.421
the slope of the tangent
line would be the same.

00:01:58.421 --> 00:02:01.108
And so this would be the c that exists.

00:02:01.108 --> 00:02:04.036
Now, in this video, we're not
trying to identify the c's,

00:02:04.036 --> 00:02:04.987
we're just trying to say,

00:02:04.987 --> 00:02:07.130
can we apply the mean value theorem?

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:08.368
So let's look at this first interval

00:02:08.368 --> 00:02:11.031
from negative five to negative
one, a closed interval.

00:02:11.031 --> 00:02:15.257
So we're going from negative
five to negative one.

00:02:15.257 --> 00:02:18.895
So are we differentiable
over the interval,

00:02:18.895 --> 00:02:20.615
over the open interval?

00:02:20.615 --> 00:02:23.483
We have this discontinuity over here

00:02:23.483 --> 00:02:25.264
that's not going to
make it differentiable,

00:02:25.264 --> 00:02:26.546
and, of course, this is also,

00:02:26.546 --> 00:02:28.297
if we're not continuous, we're not going

00:02:28.297 --> 00:02:30.108
to be differentiable here.

00:02:30.108 --> 00:02:32.236
So this discontinuity here

00:02:32.236 --> 00:02:34.772
actually violates both
of these conditions.

00:02:34.772 --> 00:02:37.368
And so for this first
interval, we would say, no,

00:02:37.368 --> 00:02:40.733
the mean value theorem does not apply.

00:02:40.733 --> 00:02:44.024
Now, the second one, from
negative one to three.

00:02:44.024 --> 00:02:45.774
So I'll do this in a
slightly different color.

00:02:45.774 --> 00:02:48.778
So we're gonna go from
negative one, right over there,

00:02:48.778 --> 00:02:49.611
to three.

00:02:50.514 --> 00:02:55.072
And if you look over this
interval, it looks like,

00:02:55.072 --> 00:02:57.109
over that interval, over
that closed interval,

00:02:57.109 --> 00:02:59.967
our function just really
looks like a line.

00:02:59.967 --> 00:03:02.729
And so it is both continuous
and differentiable

00:03:02.729 --> 00:03:04.012
over that interval,

00:03:04.012 --> 00:03:05.944
and it makes sense that the
mean value theorem applies.

00:03:05.944 --> 00:03:09.189
Actually, every c on this interval is the

00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:11.317
derivative, is the
instantaneous rate of change

00:03:11.317 --> 00:03:12.773
equal to the average rate of change

00:03:12.773 --> 00:03:15.233
because it looks linear
over this interval.

00:03:15.233 --> 00:03:18.644
So the mean value theorem
definitely applies over there.

00:03:18.644 --> 00:03:21.708
Now, what about from three to seven?

00:03:21.708 --> 00:03:25.041
The closed interval from three to seven.

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:28.168
So when we look at this closed interval,

00:03:28.168 --> 00:03:31.821
we're definitely continuous
over the interval.

00:03:31.821 --> 00:03:35.684
So we meet the second criteria,
but are we differentiable?

00:03:35.684 --> 00:03:38.099
Well, a good giveaway of
a point that is continuous

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:40.288
but not differentiable is right over here.

00:03:40.288 --> 00:03:42.280
Whenever you have these sharp edges,

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:44.755
because we don't have a well-defined

00:03:44.755 --> 00:03:47.660
slope of a tangent line here.

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:50.966
Would it be that, would it
be that, would it be that?

00:03:50.966 --> 00:03:53.622
And so because we aren't
differentiable at that point,

00:03:53.622 --> 00:03:55.222
at x is equal to six,

00:03:55.222 --> 00:03:57.365
we aren't differentiable
over this open interval

00:03:57.365 --> 00:03:59.207
from three to seven,

00:03:59.207 --> 00:04:03.236
and so the mean value
theorem does not apply.

00:04:03.236 --> 00:04:04.897
And you can even see that visually.

00:04:04.897 --> 00:04:08.293
The average rate of change
between the endpoints

00:04:08.293 --> 00:04:10.270
of our interval,

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:12.820
or if we want to think about
the slope of the secant line,

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:14.345
that's that right over there,

00:04:14.345 --> 00:04:17.711
and over the interval,
we don't see any point

00:04:17.711 --> 00:04:19.257
where the instantaneous rate of change,

00:04:19.257 --> 00:04:20.827
where the slope of the tangent line

00:04:20.827 --> 00:04:23.800
is equal to the slope of the secant line

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:27.015
between the endpoints of our interval.

00:04:27.015 --> 00:04:30.215
So once again, mean value
theorem would not apply.

00:04:30.215 --> 00:04:33.430
Now, what about from
negative three to two?

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:34.486
I'll do this in orange.

00:04:34.486 --> 00:04:38.569
So from negative three,
right over there, to two.

00:04:40.297 --> 00:04:41.972
Well, if we look at the open interval

00:04:41.972 --> 00:04:43.828
from negative three to two,

00:04:43.828 --> 00:04:45.262
we're not considering what happens

00:04:45.262 --> 00:04:47.526
at negative three and at two,

00:04:47.526 --> 00:04:49.624
over the open interval,

00:04:49.624 --> 00:04:53.352
it does look like we are both
differentiable and continuous.

00:04:53.352 --> 00:04:55.948
So we're definitely differentiable
over the open interval.

00:04:55.948 --> 00:04:59.238
But clearly, we're not continuous
over the closed interval.

00:04:59.238 --> 00:05:03.313
At negative three, we
actually are not continuous.

00:05:03.313 --> 00:05:04.581
And so because of that,

00:05:04.581 --> 00:05:07.313
the mean value theorem does not apply.

00:05:07.313 --> 00:05:09.796
And you can actually even
see that it would not apply

00:05:09.796 --> 00:05:12.497
because if you look at the
slope of the secant line

00:05:12.497 --> 00:05:14.158
between our endpoints,

00:05:14.158 --> 00:05:16.361
that's the secant line right over there,

00:05:16.361 --> 00:05:20.497
and so you could see, over
that interval, there is no c

00:05:20.497 --> 00:05:22.232
between negative three and two,

00:05:22.232 --> 00:05:23.938
where the slope of the tangent line

00:05:23.938 --> 00:05:26.292
or the instantaneous
slope or the derivative

00:05:26.292 --> 00:05:30.171
is going to be the same as
the slope of the secant line.

00:05:30.171 --> 00:05:32.073
And that doesn't violate
the mean value theorem

00:05:32.073 --> 00:05:34.208
because the mean value theorem
just doesn't apply here,

00:05:34.208 --> 00:05:35.703
we haven't met the condition

00:05:35.703 --> 00:05:38.961
of being continuous over
the closed interval.
