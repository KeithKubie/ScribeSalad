00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.100
MICHELLE KAUFMANN: I'm super
excited to be here today

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:17.400
to be with Danielle Teller, who
is an author and a dear friend.

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.250
And I'm going to share just
a little bit about her.

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:25.860
She grew up in Canada, where
she was a bookworm and dreamed

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:27.550
of being a writer.

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:30.210
But she chickened out and
went to medical school

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.296
instead and attended
Queen's University

00:00:34.296 --> 00:00:35.920
as well as getting
her medical training

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.210
at McGill, Brown, and Yale.

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:42.730
She's held faculty physicians
at the University of Pittsburgh

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:45.670
and Harvard where
she investigated

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:48.490
the origins of
chronic lung disease

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:52.040
and taught in the medical
intensive care unit.

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:56.930
Then in 2013, she quit her
job to pursue that childhood

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:58.640
dream of writing.

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.940
She co-wrote "Sacred Cows: The
Truth of Divorce and Marriage"

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.480
with her husband, our
own beloved Astro Teller.

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:10.130
She has also been a regular
writer for "Quartz" with wit

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:11.780
as well as data.

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.980
She writes about controversial
yet accurate unseen

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:20.120
truths hiding behind many
of our long-held beliefs.

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:22.280
And some of my
favorite column titles

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.820
include "The idiotic
argument Americans

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:28.860
use in almost every
political debate,"

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.860
"Let mom down from the
pedestal: in praise

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:33.260
of the messy, imperfect,
authentic mother," which

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.810
was a Mother's Day
writing of course,

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.370
"Nearly all our medical
research is wrong,"

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:42.950
"How American parenting is
killing the American marriage."

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:45.770
We're super excited to
have Danielle here today.

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:50.810
And we'll be discussing her book
called "All the Ever Afters."

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:52.410
Before we start
discussing with her,

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:55.350
she's going to do a
little reading for us.

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:56.469
Thank you.

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:58.010
DANIELLE TELLER:
Thank you, Michelle.

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:59.954
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:59.954 --> 00:02:02.450
I'm super excited to be here.

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:04.790
And I'm super impressed that
people are taking time out

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:06.890
of their busy work
days to be sure.

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:08.600
I'm very touched.

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:10.910
So thank you.

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:13.400
So I'm going to read the
prologue from the book, which

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.580
I think really sets up what
the book is about and gives you

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:18.950
a flavor of the
style of writing,

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:20.960
and in a couple
of sentences just

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:23.450
described the arc of the book.

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:26.510
And then we'll have a chat.

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:29.680
Hopefully all of us
will have a chat.

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.960
"Prologue-- The Royal Court.

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:37.000
Suppers at the royal court have
become entirely too oppressive.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.130
It isn't just that
they're interminable

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:42.010
or that we must adhere to
the newest fashions, the face

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:46.090
powder, our hair tortured into
great bejeweled ram's horns,

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:48.910
the silks with sleeves
so tight that it's

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:53.350
impossible to raise one spoon to
one's carefully tinctured lips.

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:57.790
No, the worst is the
gossip, the sinister buzz

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:01.120
of wasps ready to slip
their poisonous stingers

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.870
into whatever tender
flesh lies exposed.

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:07.000
This evening I
was ordered to sit

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.720
next to the Earl of Bryston, a
pompous halfwit who has rarely

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:11.920
been to court.

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:15.130
He presides over some
godforsaken swamp in the north,

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:17.530
and he seems to believe that
his family's long history

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:19.240
of loyalty to the
crown gives him

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:22.750
the right to opine on the
behaviors of the royal family.

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:26.590
My lady, he said, plucking at
cuffs so voluminous that they

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:29.440
draped into his
suit, I understand

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.730
that your nubile
daughters are not yet wed.

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:34.980
No, my Lord, I
answered as briefly

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:36.840
as courtesy would allow.

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:38.970
And yet, I've heard
that they once

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:41.940
vied for the attention
of Prince Henry himself.

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:44.600
The earl dabbed his
crimson lips daintily.

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:47.040
That they tried to
alienate his affection

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:48.990
from Princess Elfilda.

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:51.710
You seem amused, my lord.

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:56.040
He could not have mistaken
the coldness in my response.

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:59.113
I fear that much of what
you have heard is not true.

00:03:59.113 --> 00:04:02.160
Ah, well, it is an
incredible tale.

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:03.600
He smiled broadly.

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:05.550
The beautiful
downtrodden maiden who

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:08.970
ascends to the royal palace,
the jealous stepsisters,

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:11.700
the glass slipper
that would not fit.

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:14.660
My lord, I cannot
credit such a tale.

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:17.370
Ah, come, my lady, you
know that the whole kingdom

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:20.500
is enthralled by our radiant
and benevolent princess.

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:22.940
I've heard a great deal
about you and your daughters.

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:25.290
He looked at me knowingly.

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:29.600
Compelling fiction often
obscures the humble truth.

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.760
I do hope that you'll
tell me about the slipper,

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:34.190
he said, ignoring my reluctance.

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:36.590
He broke a piece of bread
leaving a trail of crumbs

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:38.060
across the table.

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:40.820
My wife is frantic to
know the particulars.

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:44.300
They say that the prince let
every maiden try the shoe even

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:45.230
your daughters.

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:47.000
He laughed.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.160
It is droll to imagine
them receiving attention

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:50.500
from a prince.

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:53.810
Well, his shrug was eloquent.

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:56.910
They are ugly and
Elfilda is beautiful.

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:59.190
The Earl frowned
and pursed his lips.

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:01.710
It's genteel to
imply nasty insults

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:04.590
not to speak them directly.

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:07.740
My lord, I may have heard some
of the rumors to which you

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:08.820
allude.

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:10.800
To my mind, these
stories insinuate

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:12.300
a plague of blindness.

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:14.760
Prince Henry would have to
be blind not to recognize

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:17.910
the object of his admiration
or to distinguish an ugly girl

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:19.627
from one of unsurpassed beauty.

00:05:19.627 --> 00:05:21.960
My daughters would need to
be blind to their reflections

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:25.230
in the mirrors and on the
faces of those who behold them.

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:30.030
My voice rose, so I paused
and began again blandly.

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:32.820
They would also need to
be blind to the truth

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:35.940
that men persuade themselves
that beautiful women possess

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:39.450
virtue and good character,
whereas no amount of virtue

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:41.846
can make an ugly
woman beautiful.

00:05:41.846 --> 00:05:45.120
Ah, my lady, Princess
Elfilda that a dazzling star

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:48.580
who shines in the royal
firmament where she belongs.

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:51.320
He did not attempt to
conceal his disdain.

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:53.250
That she invites you
and your daughters

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:56.700
to dine here at the palace is
a testament to her compassion,

00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:59.660
forgiveness, and generosity.

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:02.450
Indeed, my Lord, I murmured.

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:05.739
Indeed that is so.

00:06:05.739 --> 00:06:07.530
I'm only of interest
to the Earl of Bryston

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:10.210
and his ilk because
of my stepdaughter.

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:12.360
Princess Elfilda is the
most celebrated woman

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:15.210
in the kingdom, perhaps
in all of history.

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:17.820
Commoners line the
streets for endless hours

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:20.310
even in dark and sleet
hoping to glimpse

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:23.550
her face through the window
of her gilded carriage.

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:25.770
When the princess has
a gown cut in a new way

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:28.620
or adopts a different
hairstyle, every female creature

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:31.110
in the city imitates
her appearance.

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:34.620
Last autumn she wore a choker of
pearls to church on Michaelmas.

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:36.840
And the next day every
noble woman's throat

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:39.420
was wound snugly with
pearls or other jewels.

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:41.100
By Christmastide,
even the peasant girls

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:43.200
wore chokers of beads
or ribbon, whatever

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:45.940
material they could find
to replicate the fashion.

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:48.750
Princess Elfilda's popularity
derives in large part

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:50.906
from her astonishing beauty.

00:06:50.906 --> 00:06:52.530
There's something
else about her nature

00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:54.240
that attracts the masses.

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:56.940
Her habitual muteness
and the gentle hesitancy

00:06:56.940 --> 00:06:59.700
of those rare words that
do fall from her lips

00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:03.210
make her seem bashful as does
her manner of ducking her head

00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:05.610
and looking up through
sweeping lashes.

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:07.620
Apart from her collection
of bobbles and kennel

00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:11.389
of favorite dogs, she appears
to have no passions or vises.

00:07:11.389 --> 00:07:12.930
And when she attends
royal functions,

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:15.540
her gaze drifts to
invisible spectacles

00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:17.700
that only she can apprehend.

00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:20.880
Her elusive character
is a blank parchment

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:23.600
upon which any story
may be written.

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:26.772
And every girl who dreams
of becoming a princess

00:07:26.772 --> 00:07:28.480
can imagine herself
in Princess Elfilda's

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:31.860
to famously tiny shoes.

00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:35.010
I know more of the princess's
history than anyone else alive,

00:07:35.010 --> 00:07:37.590
and the true tale is not as
fantastical as the one sung

00:07:37.590 --> 00:07:39.060
by troubadours.

00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:41.670
Nobody's interested in the
story of a flesh-and-blood's

00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:45.660
nobleman's daughter, one who wet
her bed, complained of boredom,

00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:48.270
fought with her kin, and turned
up her nose at winter greens

00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:50.620
just like any mortal child.

00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:53.310
Nor do I have any desire
to diminish the adulation

00:07:53.310 --> 00:07:56.010
for the princess, which
makes both the admiring

00:07:56.010 --> 00:07:58.170
and the admired so content.

00:07:58.170 --> 00:08:01.320
I do not set out to write
the princess's history,

00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:05.550
but my own, the only tale I
have the authority to tell.

00:08:05.550 --> 00:08:07.320
My quill me resurrect
ghosts to keep

00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:09.930
me company during the
long days at the castle.

00:08:09.930 --> 00:08:12.720
And if it cannot, at least
my mind will be occupied

00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:14.550
and my hands busy.

00:08:14.550 --> 00:08:18.030
As for fables about good and
evil and songs about glass

00:08:18.030 --> 00:08:21.360
slippers, I shall leave
those to the minstrels.

00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:25.690
They can invent their own
tales about Cinderella."

00:08:25.690 --> 00:08:28.970
So that's the prologue,
which I think sort of sets

00:08:28.970 --> 00:08:31.630
up the book in that
she's going to tell

00:08:31.630 --> 00:08:33.255
her story from her perspective.

00:08:33.255 --> 00:08:34.880
And it really is the
story of her life.

00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:37.340
So it starts from when
she is about 10 years old.

00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:40.070
And we follow her
till she's about 50.

00:08:40.070 --> 00:08:43.230
And I think of it as kind
of a nested fairy tale,

00:08:43.230 --> 00:08:48.390
where Agnes has her own
rags-to-rich arc of her life.

00:08:48.390 --> 00:08:50.957
And then toward the last
third or quarter of the book

00:08:50.957 --> 00:08:52.790
we get much more of the
Cinderella elements,

00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:56.150
and we get sort of Cinderella
story embedded in the longer

00:08:56.150 --> 00:08:59.119
story of the stepmother's life.

00:08:59.119 --> 00:09:01.160
So I'll leave it at that,
and we can have a chat.

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:02.330
MICHELLE KAUFMANN:
Great, yeah, I

00:09:02.330 --> 00:09:04.210
have questions that I
wanted to ask Danielle,

00:09:04.210 --> 00:09:06.010
but then we want to
open it up to the group

00:09:06.010 --> 00:09:07.400
too and have a discussion.

00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:10.500
And hopefully you guys all
have questions for her as well.

00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:12.015
But I'd love to start with--

00:09:12.015 --> 00:09:14.530
this is your first
piece of fiction.

00:09:14.530 --> 00:09:17.140
Everything before has been
very factual, and interesting,

00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:19.210
and beautiful.

00:09:19.210 --> 00:09:20.710
But this is fiction.

00:09:20.710 --> 00:09:24.922
What drove you to this
methodology of writing?

00:09:24.922 --> 00:09:26.380
DANIELLE TELLER:
Well, I had always

00:09:26.380 --> 00:09:29.320
wanted to be in
novelist my entire life.

00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:31.750
And I took a very,
very long detour

00:09:31.750 --> 00:09:34.750
through medicine, and
science, and nonfiction.

00:09:34.750 --> 00:09:37.670
And sort of finally got
back to my true love.

00:09:37.670 --> 00:09:40.990
And I think that
fiction is one more

00:09:40.990 --> 00:09:45.070
way in which we can examine
our lives and the world

00:09:45.070 --> 00:09:46.270
that we live in.

00:09:46.270 --> 00:09:50.620
I think it's a tool that can
make us think differently

00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:52.615
about our everyday lives.

00:09:52.615 --> 00:09:53.740
MICHELLE KAUFMANN: So true.

00:09:53.740 --> 00:09:57.400
And how did you come up then
with this particular idea

00:09:57.400 --> 00:10:00.580
of the retelling of Cinderella
from her stepmother's

00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:02.420
perspective?

00:10:02.420 --> 00:10:04.840
DANIELLE TELLER: So I
had had a different novel

00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:08.330
in the back of my
mind for a long time.

00:10:08.330 --> 00:10:12.460
But then I became
a stepmother, and I

00:10:12.460 --> 00:10:16.090
spent a lot of time thinking
about being a stepmother

00:10:16.090 --> 00:10:18.550
because it was something
that I struggled with.

00:10:18.550 --> 00:10:20.390
You don't grow up
thinking, when I grow up,

00:10:20.390 --> 00:10:21.640
I want to be a stepmom.

00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:24.160
It just happens to you,
and you haven't usually

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:25.100
thought it through.

00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:28.650
And I was really surprised
at how challenging

00:10:28.650 --> 00:10:30.082
a relationship that was.

00:10:30.082 --> 00:10:31.540
And what I realized
with that there

00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:35.020
are a lot of
intrinsic difficulties

00:10:35.020 --> 00:10:36.220
in the relationship.

00:10:36.220 --> 00:10:38.020
Because for the
child, especially

00:10:38.020 --> 00:10:40.240
if it's due to
divorce-- so the child

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:42.910
already has two loving parents.

00:10:42.910 --> 00:10:44.619
Welcoming another
parent into their lives

00:10:44.619 --> 00:10:46.493
is not something that
they are looking to do.

00:10:46.493 --> 00:10:48.220
They don't want
this other stranger

00:10:48.220 --> 00:10:51.070
coming into their lives,
and ordering them around,

00:10:51.070 --> 00:10:53.920
and changing their routines, and
sucking up the attention of one

00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:54.850
of their parents.

00:10:54.850 --> 00:10:58.135
It's sort of a negative if
they already feel supported,

00:10:58.135 --> 00:11:00.010
and loved, and have
everything that they need

00:11:00.010 --> 00:11:02.320
from their biological parents.

00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:06.800
And also, for the stepparents,
I realize it's also challenging.

00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:09.880
Because I think we make
a lot of assumptions

00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:11.660
about human relationships.

00:11:11.660 --> 00:11:13.690
And one of the
assumptions we make

00:11:13.690 --> 00:11:17.380
is that if you are an adult and
you enter into a child's life,

00:11:17.380 --> 00:11:19.840
that you are automatically
going to love that child

00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:22.480
and that child is automatically
going to love you back.

00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:25.120
But it doesn't
always work that way.

00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:27.629
It takes time.

00:11:27.629 --> 00:11:29.170
When you have your
own child, I think

00:11:29.170 --> 00:11:34.120
that mother nature gives us
the gift of this bond when

00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:35.650
your child is born.

00:11:35.650 --> 00:11:38.464
But being a stepparent is a bit
like your kid bringing a friend

00:11:38.464 --> 00:11:39.880
home, and then all
of a sudden you

00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:41.900
have to be a parent
to that friend.

00:11:41.900 --> 00:11:44.260
So you don't know
that child as well.

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:46.810
You don't necessarily
have that bond already.

00:11:46.810 --> 00:11:50.800
And especially if
they have resentments,

00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:53.170
they don't see you as a net
positive in their lives.

00:11:53.170 --> 00:11:55.077
It can be a really
challenging relationship

00:11:55.077 --> 00:11:57.160
because you have to do all
the stuff for the child

00:11:57.160 --> 00:11:58.451
that you do for your own child.

00:11:58.451 --> 00:12:00.460
You have to cook, and
clean, and care for them,

00:12:00.460 --> 00:12:01.810
and drive them around.

00:12:01.810 --> 00:12:03.220
But they don't necessarily--

00:12:03.220 --> 00:12:05.636
I mean, your own kids probably
don't say thank you either.

00:12:05.636 --> 00:12:07.902
But they don't
necessarily love you.

00:12:07.902 --> 00:12:10.360
They don't give you the hugs,
and kisses, and all the stuff

00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:12.287
that makes it easier to do.

00:12:12.287 --> 00:12:13.870
And so when I was
thinking about that,

00:12:13.870 --> 00:12:15.790
I thought, huh, I wonder--

00:12:15.790 --> 00:12:18.310
I was thinking about how
vilified stepmoms are

00:12:18.310 --> 00:12:19.960
in so many fairy tales.

00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:22.990
And then I thought I
wonder if those grew out

00:12:22.990 --> 00:12:26.620
of this intrinsically
difficult relationship,

00:12:26.620 --> 00:12:28.810
and that behind
these tales are just

00:12:28.810 --> 00:12:32.290
ordinary flawed human
beings trying to get along

00:12:32.290 --> 00:12:35.320
and trying to have
a relationship.

00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:37.677
And that's where Agnes was born.

00:12:37.677 --> 00:12:39.010
MICHELLE KAUFMANN: I love Agnes.

00:12:39.010 --> 00:12:41.740
How did you find
the right balance

00:12:41.740 --> 00:12:46.790
of describing Agnes's
perspective from Cinderella?

00:12:46.790 --> 00:12:49.360
Because there were so many
threads throughout the book

00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:52.630
where you could see the
commonality between the fairy

00:12:52.630 --> 00:12:57.214
tale and Agnes's version
of the reality of her tale.

00:12:57.214 --> 00:13:00.932
How did you find
that right balance?

00:13:00.932 --> 00:13:02.390
DANIELLE TELLER:
So I really wanted

00:13:02.390 --> 00:13:06.710
it to feel like a real family,
like real people who are

00:13:06.710 --> 00:13:09.120
struggling with these issues.

00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:12.290
And so the most challenging
thing about the book

00:13:12.290 --> 00:13:15.440
was trying to thread the needle
between making the stepmother

00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:18.440
mother legitimately evil
because she couldn't

00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:20.474
be this wonderful
person or there'd

00:13:20.474 --> 00:13:21.515
be no story there, right?

00:13:21.515 --> 00:13:23.750
So she had to actually
conform to the fairy tale.

00:13:23.750 --> 00:13:25.760
She had to be a pretty
suboptimal parent

00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:26.572
to Cinderella.

00:13:26.572 --> 00:13:28.280
But at the same time,
I wanted the reader

00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:31.460
to have developed enough
empathy for that character

00:13:31.460 --> 00:13:36.350
that they could actually see
how she got to this place.

00:13:36.350 --> 00:13:41.360
And so one of the ways in
which I tried to do that

00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:43.670
was-- so I was
inspired by a story

00:13:43.670 --> 00:13:46.790
that a colleague told
me a long time ago.

00:13:46.790 --> 00:13:50.420
She was telling me
about how her child has

00:13:50.420 --> 00:13:54.050
obsessive compulsive disorder
and her husband does as well.

00:13:54.050 --> 00:13:58.370
And she was saying that it's
so difficult for her to parent

00:13:58.370 --> 00:13:59.780
the child relative
to her husband

00:13:59.780 --> 00:14:01.700
because she doesn't
intrinsically

00:14:01.700 --> 00:14:05.960
understand the ways in
which his OCD affects

00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:10.070
how he absorbs everything
around him about the world.

00:14:10.070 --> 00:14:12.920
So she said, the
family goes to the zoo.

00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:14.960
He steps in a puddle,
gets a wet sock,

00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:17.060
and then he has to go
home and change his sock.

00:14:17.060 --> 00:14:18.601
And she'll try to
talk him out of it,

00:14:18.601 --> 00:14:21.110
and say, the whole
family is here.

00:14:21.110 --> 00:14:24.410
Can't we just go without
a shoe and a sock?

00:14:24.410 --> 00:14:28.370
And her husband will say, oh,
a wet sock is intolerable.

00:14:28.370 --> 00:14:30.920
Of course, you have to go
home and change your socks

00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:34.940
because he just has a much more
visceral understanding of how

00:14:34.940 --> 00:14:36.800
the child is experiencing
that wet sock.

00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:38.870
That she, not
having OCD herself,

00:14:38.870 --> 00:14:40.460
couldn't really understand.

00:14:40.460 --> 00:14:41.840
So this was a story she told me.

00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:44.000
And I've thought
about that a lot

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.600
as a parent, how you understand
some of your children

00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:50.090
more easily than
others because you have

00:14:50.090 --> 00:14:52.710
traits in common with them.

00:14:52.710 --> 00:14:54.590
And so I tried to
build this relationship

00:14:54.590 --> 00:14:58.490
where the stepmother is
not a horrible person

00:14:58.490 --> 00:14:59.360
or a good person.

00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:01.568
Cinderella is not a horrible
person or a good person,

00:15:01.568 --> 00:15:03.170
but they have this disconnect.

00:15:03.170 --> 00:15:05.750
The way that they are in
the world is very different.

00:15:05.750 --> 00:15:07.520
And the way Cinderella
has been brought up

00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:10.010
is very different from how
Agnes has been brought up.

00:15:10.010 --> 00:15:15.079
And so she really doesn't
understand the girl.

00:15:15.079 --> 00:15:17.120
MICHELLE KAUFMANN: In the
beginning of the novel,

00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:17.990
Agnes says--

00:15:17.990 --> 00:15:19.860
and I love this line--

00:15:19.860 --> 00:15:24.800
compelling fiction often
obscures the humble truth.

00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:27.390
How do you think fairy
tales and folklore

00:15:27.390 --> 00:15:31.400
influence our expectations and
experiences in the real world?

00:15:34.670 --> 00:15:36.170
DANIELLE TELLER: I
think fairy tales

00:15:36.170 --> 00:15:42.680
are so appealing because they're
really morally unambiguous just

00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:47.110
like Marvel movies or
a lot of the stories

00:15:47.110 --> 00:15:50.090
that we absorb as children.

00:15:50.090 --> 00:15:51.340
We know who the good guys are.

00:15:51.340 --> 00:15:52.310
We know who the bad guys are.

00:15:52.310 --> 00:15:53.810
We know who to
root for, and we're

00:15:53.810 --> 00:15:55.700
going to be happy when
the good guy wins.

00:15:55.700 --> 00:15:58.610
And we really don't care when
the bad guy gets blown up

00:15:58.610 --> 00:16:00.770
or has her eyes
pecked out by birds

00:16:00.770 --> 00:16:04.130
in the case of the stepsisters
because we know they're bad.

00:16:04.130 --> 00:16:06.850
And so we don't have to
waste a single moment feeling

00:16:06.850 --> 00:16:07.762
bad for them.

00:16:07.762 --> 00:16:09.470
We can just clap our
hands, and say, ooh,

00:16:09.470 --> 00:16:12.062
that was a great story.

00:16:12.062 --> 00:16:13.520
I think that for
children there are

00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:15.311
things that they can
learn from fairy tales

00:16:15.311 --> 00:16:17.870
about how to be generous, how
to be good, how to be loyal,

00:16:17.870 --> 00:16:19.320
and brave, and so on.

00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:21.290
So there are I think
some good lessons

00:16:21.290 --> 00:16:23.360
to be learned from fairy tales.

00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:27.620
But I also think that our
natural tendency, especially

00:16:27.620 --> 00:16:30.680
in the Western world, to put
everything in categories--

00:16:30.680 --> 00:16:33.530
so this has been a way of
thinking that has been very

00:16:33.530 --> 00:16:36.200
adaptive for Western society.

00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:39.420
From Greek logic on, it's
given us the enlightenment.

00:16:39.420 --> 00:16:41.690
It's given us
computers, the ability

00:16:41.690 --> 00:16:45.020
to put things in categories and
say, if this, then not that.

00:16:45.020 --> 00:16:45.990
This person is good.

00:16:45.990 --> 00:16:50.840
This person is bad,
categories that are exclusive.

00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:52.400
But those don't
apply well to humans.

00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:53.870
And I think that
we have a tendency

00:16:53.870 --> 00:16:58.490
to want to use that same way of
thinking as applies to humans.

00:16:58.490 --> 00:17:00.590
And it's very satisfying
in a fairy tale.

00:17:00.590 --> 00:17:02.150
But in real life,
I think it really

00:17:02.150 --> 00:17:04.920
can trip us up
because, of course,

00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:06.079
people aren't good or bad.

00:17:06.079 --> 00:17:09.440
If you say, I'm a good person,
well, good relative to what?

00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:13.490
Like who are the bad people
I'm comparing myself to?

00:17:13.490 --> 00:17:16.250
And I think that gets us
into these ways of thinking

00:17:16.250 --> 00:17:20.780
about people in jail must be bad
people because they're in jail.

00:17:20.780 --> 00:17:22.910
And so therefore,
we can let ourselves

00:17:22.910 --> 00:17:26.300
off the hook about sort
of caring what happens.

00:17:26.300 --> 00:17:28.550
And we get into a tizzy
when people we think

00:17:28.550 --> 00:17:32.060
are good people, comedians
who made us laugh growing up,

00:17:32.060 --> 00:17:34.700
who seemed like good
people do terrible things.

00:17:37.274 --> 00:17:38.690
Our heads explode
because we don't

00:17:38.690 --> 00:17:40.065
know how to hold
that in our head

00:17:40.065 --> 00:17:41.990
that, wow, this person
who I had slotted

00:17:41.990 --> 00:17:44.860
in the category of good
person is now having

00:17:44.860 --> 00:17:47.270
these behaviors that are bad.

00:17:47.270 --> 00:17:51.860
And so in this way,
the novel really

00:17:51.860 --> 00:17:53.380
is looking at the backstory.

00:17:53.380 --> 00:17:57.230
So what if those categories
that we put people in really

00:17:57.230 --> 00:17:57.980
don't exist?

00:17:57.980 --> 00:18:00.530
And what if they're just people?

00:18:00.530 --> 00:18:03.890
MICHELLE KAUFMANN: Which feels
so timely right now, not only

00:18:03.890 --> 00:18:06.710
in teams we work
with, our families,

00:18:06.710 --> 00:18:10.040
but our society right now
and our country right now

00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:11.660
where it's so divided.

00:18:11.660 --> 00:18:16.190
And just having moments
of trying to see

00:18:16.190 --> 00:18:21.460
different perspectives is
challenging, but so critical.

00:18:21.460 --> 00:18:23.310
It's something that
really stuck with me

00:18:23.310 --> 00:18:24.560
after reading this book.

00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:27.140
Maybe I actually
do spend some time

00:18:27.140 --> 00:18:30.330
with my father talking
about politics.

00:18:30.330 --> 00:18:31.780
Maybe.

00:18:31.780 --> 00:18:34.970
Like maybe understanding
his backstory is good.

00:18:34.970 --> 00:18:36.920
DANIELLE TELLER:
Yeah, [INAUDIBLE]..

00:18:36.920 --> 00:18:38.920
MICHELLE KAUFMANN: And
these categories though--

00:18:38.920 --> 00:18:40.611
there's the aesthetic
part of it too.

00:18:40.611 --> 00:18:43.110
And Danielle and I, when we
have been talking about the book

00:18:43.110 --> 00:18:45.390
before, it was
interesting because we

00:18:45.390 --> 00:18:48.050
shared an experience of the
original Cinderella fairy

00:18:48.050 --> 00:18:50.190
tale, where when
we read this book,

00:18:50.190 --> 00:18:52.290
Cinderella is so
lovely, and beautiful,

00:18:52.290 --> 00:18:54.770
and blond with this
teeny-tiny little waist.

00:18:54.770 --> 00:18:57.450
And Danielle and I
when we were growing up

00:18:57.450 --> 00:18:59.282
were like, well, that's great.

00:18:59.282 --> 00:19:00.740
But like, we don't
have blond hair.

00:19:00.740 --> 00:19:04.110
And we don't fit that profile,
how her figure is drawn.

00:19:04.110 --> 00:19:08.424
So we both really resonated
more with her stepsisters.

00:19:08.424 --> 00:19:09.840
And I'm just
wondering what do you

00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:13.110
think that does to people
long term when you don't fit

00:19:13.110 --> 00:19:19.318
the idealized version of the
characters like Cinderella

00:19:19.318 --> 00:19:23.560
or you resonate with
stepsisters who are seen

00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:27.260
as more evil, and ugly, and
terrible, and all the things

00:19:27.260 --> 00:19:28.189
you don't want to be?

00:19:28.189 --> 00:19:30.230
DANIELLE TELLER: Yeah, I
thought about that a lot

00:19:30.230 --> 00:19:30.938
writing the book.

00:19:30.938 --> 00:19:33.095
And I think it's complicated.

00:19:33.095 --> 00:19:34.730
It messed with my
mind a bit when

00:19:34.730 --> 00:19:39.811
I was a kid because I was
this tall, lanky, dark-haired

00:19:39.811 --> 00:19:40.310
person.

00:19:40.310 --> 00:19:42.350
I didn't have the blond
curls or the tiny feet.

00:19:42.350 --> 00:19:43.985
And so when I would play
games with my friends--

00:19:43.985 --> 00:19:44.840
so we'd play make believe--

00:19:44.840 --> 00:19:47.173
I'd always have to be one of
the boys, have to be a man.

00:19:47.173 --> 00:19:51.170
I'd have to be the villain often
because I was much more manly.

00:19:51.170 --> 00:19:56.940
And so I longed to be that
delicate little thing.

00:19:56.940 --> 00:19:59.270
I longed to be that
ideal of feminine beauty

00:19:59.270 --> 00:20:02.570
with the tiny feet and so on.

00:20:02.570 --> 00:20:05.780
But I also feel in some ways,
it was actually really good

00:20:05.780 --> 00:20:09.230
for me not to have
grown up feeling

00:20:09.230 --> 00:20:12.110
that I could be the
Cinderella character because I

00:20:12.110 --> 00:20:14.270
think it caused me to
put all of that aside.

00:20:14.270 --> 00:20:17.150
I was like, nope, I'm not going
to be that pretty feminine

00:20:17.150 --> 00:20:19.430
little thing so I may
as well just ignore

00:20:19.430 --> 00:20:22.940
that, all the Cinderella
aspirations that I think

00:20:22.940 --> 00:20:25.200
can be quite harmful
for children--

00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:28.662
this leaning in for the
brass ring, the marriage

00:20:28.662 --> 00:20:29.870
that's going to transform me.

00:20:29.870 --> 00:20:31.495
You're going to go
through this portal,

00:20:31.495 --> 00:20:34.220
and you'll be someone else
coming out the other side.

00:20:34.220 --> 00:20:37.260
I didn't grow up
thinking any of that.

00:20:37.260 --> 00:20:43.130
And I actually think that that
turned out to be a good thing.

00:20:43.130 --> 00:20:44.851
I also think it's
really interesting--

00:20:44.851 --> 00:20:46.850
because, of course, you
can be beautiful and not

00:20:46.850 --> 00:20:49.501
conform to society's
expectations of what's

00:20:49.501 --> 00:20:50.000
beautiful.

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:52.980
And so with the stepsisters, I
played with that a little bit.

00:20:52.980 --> 00:20:55.130
So one of them is beautiful.

00:20:55.130 --> 00:20:58.320
But because
fairness, fair skin--

00:20:58.320 --> 00:21:01.280
fair, which means
beautiful, also means pale.

00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:05.014
And that was very much the sort
of fetish in the Middle Ages

00:21:05.014 --> 00:21:06.680
was to be pale, pale,
pale, like as pale

00:21:06.680 --> 00:21:08.220
as you possibly could be.

00:21:08.220 --> 00:21:11.320
So one of them is dark
skinned and doesn't

00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:16.035
fit that ideal of beauty
even though she's beautiful.

00:21:16.035 --> 00:21:18.320
But then the other
sister is disfigured

00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:22.790
and even her mother doesn't
think she's beautiful.

00:21:22.790 --> 00:21:27.040
And that's a really hard
thing for her in that society.

00:21:30.340 --> 00:21:32.139
People still
believed back then--

00:21:32.139 --> 00:21:32.930
what was it called?

00:21:32.930 --> 00:21:35.360
Physiognomy, the
science that says

00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:38.910
that what you look like actually
tells of your character.

00:21:38.910 --> 00:21:41.660
So I can tell by how
broad your forehead is

00:21:41.660 --> 00:21:44.090
or how small your
nose is whether you're

00:21:44.090 --> 00:21:47.390
a mean person or a smart person.

00:21:47.390 --> 00:21:49.610
So they actually in the
Middle Ages believed this.

00:21:49.610 --> 00:21:53.280
So it was very hard for them
to not conform to that beauty.

00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:56.840
But the sister who
is disfigured who

00:21:56.840 --> 00:22:00.500
has no chance of anyone ever
thinking she's beautiful

00:22:00.500 --> 00:22:02.870
is actually very freed by that.

00:22:02.870 --> 00:22:05.630
She doesn't give a fig
what anyone thinks of her.

00:22:05.630 --> 00:22:08.240
She's just been sort of
released from so much

00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:10.940
of society's expectations
because she just

00:22:10.940 --> 00:22:13.970
has to put aside this
idea that she could ever

00:22:13.970 --> 00:22:18.074
be that ideal of feminine
beauty like her stepsister.

00:22:18.074 --> 00:22:19.490
MICHELLE KAUFMANN:
And she becomes

00:22:19.490 --> 00:22:20.900
such an interesting character.

00:22:20.900 --> 00:22:24.275
She does so much that gives
her this other kind of beauty.

00:22:24.275 --> 00:22:27.860
She's the one we
really root for.

00:22:27.860 --> 00:22:31.550
Agnes goes through so many
challenges through the book,

00:22:31.550 --> 00:22:35.210
so much upheaval, so much
she has to fight for,

00:22:35.210 --> 00:22:38.604
yet the title is "All
the Ever Afters."

00:22:38.604 --> 00:22:41.070
Where did that title come from?

00:22:41.070 --> 00:22:43.630
DANIELLE TELLER: So it has
kind of a double meaning.

00:22:43.630 --> 00:22:46.140
One of the meanings is
that throughout our life,

00:22:46.140 --> 00:22:47.730
and Agnes is very
typical of this.

00:22:50.906 --> 00:22:52.530
It's like climbing
a mountain where you

00:22:52.530 --> 00:22:53.821
have these sort of false peaks.

00:22:53.821 --> 00:22:55.680
And you think, if I
just get up there,

00:22:55.680 --> 00:22:57.480
then I'm going to
be totally happy.

00:22:57.480 --> 00:23:00.150
If I just get into
this university,

00:23:00.150 --> 00:23:05.910
if I just get this job that I
want, if I just get this spouse

00:23:05.910 --> 00:23:10.260
or if only I could become a
parent, or all of these things

00:23:10.260 --> 00:23:12.630
that you think, OK, when
I get to that place,

00:23:12.630 --> 00:23:14.640
when I win this award,
when I get this grant,

00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:16.050
then I'm going to be happy.

00:23:16.050 --> 00:23:19.180
And of course, we get to
that place, and it is happy.

00:23:19.180 --> 00:23:20.460
It's not bad.

00:23:20.460 --> 00:23:23.190
But it's never the ever after.

00:23:23.190 --> 00:23:25.680
Then life goes on after that.

00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:27.430
You're never at the pinnacle.

00:23:27.430 --> 00:23:31.260
And so I think of life as this
series of happily ever afters.

00:23:31.260 --> 00:23:33.780
So Cinderella gets married,
but her life doesn't end there.

00:23:33.780 --> 00:23:36.990
She's happy she gets to marry
the prince, but it goes on.

00:23:36.990 --> 00:23:39.240
And Agnes's life is
this sort of a series

00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:41.230
of events good and bad.

00:23:41.230 --> 00:23:46.780
And none of them are ever
after until the very end.

00:23:46.780 --> 00:23:50.430
The other meaning-- one of
the things I find really

00:23:50.430 --> 00:23:53.490
fascinating about the stories
because I think that we really

00:23:53.490 --> 00:23:58.350
look at life through a narrative
lens is when a story has

00:23:58.350 --> 00:24:01.950
a happy ending, like if you and
I are competing in a spelling

00:24:01.950 --> 00:24:04.230
bee and you win--

00:24:04.230 --> 00:24:06.960
MICHELLE KAUFMANN: I doubt
that would happen, but OK.

00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:09.540
DANIELLE TELLER: But then you
get your happily ever after.

00:24:09.540 --> 00:24:10.750
Yeah, I win.

00:24:10.750 --> 00:24:12.670
But the story includes me too.

00:24:12.670 --> 00:24:15.150
And so your story is the
happy, and mine is the,

00:24:15.150 --> 00:24:18.600
oh, I'm so sad because
my dreams are crushed.

00:24:18.600 --> 00:24:20.730
And so that's the other
meaning of all the

00:24:20.730 --> 00:24:22.950
ever afters is it's not
just about one person.

00:24:22.950 --> 00:24:24.330
It's not just about Cinderella.

00:24:24.330 --> 00:24:26.130
It's about Cinderella's
stepmother,

00:24:26.130 --> 00:24:28.650
her dad, her stepsisters.

00:24:28.650 --> 00:24:31.402
It's about everybody's
ever afters.

00:24:31.402 --> 00:24:34.380
MICHELLE KAUFMANN: Love that.

00:24:34.380 --> 00:24:38.320
So Ella is described throughout
your novel as somewhat

00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:41.360
of a spoiled child,
incredibly different

00:24:41.360 --> 00:24:47.010
from the idolized Cinderella
that we all know, yet she's far

00:24:47.010 --> 00:24:51.140
more dimensional and realized.

00:24:51.140 --> 00:24:55.756
How did you design that
character behind the idol?

00:24:57.769 --> 00:24:59.310
DANIELLE TELLER: I
wanted there to be

00:24:59.310 --> 00:25:01.800
this disconnect
between the stepmother

00:25:01.800 --> 00:25:03.330
and her stepdaughter.

00:25:03.330 --> 00:25:05.780
And I thought about what is
Cinderella like from the fairy

00:25:05.780 --> 00:25:06.530
tale that we hear.

00:25:06.530 --> 00:25:07.680
She's sweet.

00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:09.790
She is kind.

00:25:09.790 --> 00:25:11.370
She's very quiet.

00:25:11.370 --> 00:25:12.390
She's obedient.

00:25:12.390 --> 00:25:14.190
She always follows the rules.

00:25:14.190 --> 00:25:16.680
She's maybe friends with
animals in the Disney version,

00:25:16.680 --> 00:25:19.360
actually in the Grimm
brothers' version as well.

00:25:19.360 --> 00:25:26.010
And so I wanted to create a
character where she could be

00:25:26.010 --> 00:25:28.425
like a real-- because that
doesn't sound like a real--

00:25:28.425 --> 00:25:31.740
as a parent you think, that's
pretty one dimensional.

00:25:31.740 --> 00:25:35.040
I can't imagine a child
who's only those things.

00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:40.470
But I thought that people who
are not neurotypical often

00:25:40.470 --> 00:25:44.070
have some of those
traits like being

00:25:44.070 --> 00:25:46.170
more loyal following and so on.

00:25:46.170 --> 00:25:50.310
And I'm surrounded by people
like that in Palo Alto

00:25:50.310 --> 00:25:51.310
and in my family.

00:25:51.310 --> 00:25:53.430
[LAUGHING]

00:25:56.430 --> 00:25:59.400
I could see that disconnect
between somebody who grew up

00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:05.370
in a very rough and tumble
world living with this girl who

00:26:05.370 --> 00:26:07.980
had many privileges, who
sort of hasn't learned

00:26:07.980 --> 00:26:10.650
the same life lessons,
but who also just

00:26:10.650 --> 00:26:13.660
has a very different
way of seeing the world.

00:26:13.660 --> 00:26:14.715
She's so much quieter.

00:26:19.470 --> 00:26:22.320
Agnes's daughters are
very physical and so on.

00:26:22.320 --> 00:26:24.570
And she's much more like--

00:26:24.570 --> 00:26:28.680
I think she describes
her at one point like sun

00:26:28.680 --> 00:26:31.040
sparkling on the water.

00:26:31.040 --> 00:26:33.740
There's something about her
that's a bit more dreamy,

00:26:33.740 --> 00:26:35.910
that's a bit more interior.

00:26:35.910 --> 00:26:40.140
And so I wanted to make
it so that the Cinderella

00:26:40.140 --> 00:26:41.880
character wouldn't be spoiled.

00:26:41.880 --> 00:26:44.080
I didn't intend for her
to come across that way.

00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:46.410
And I think one of the things
that's a real challenge

00:26:46.410 --> 00:26:49.890
us the story is told
in the first person,

00:26:49.890 --> 00:26:53.040
so you really only get
Agnes's view of everybody.

00:26:53.040 --> 00:26:55.170
And so I had to show
that she's feeling

00:26:55.170 --> 00:26:57.150
disconnected from this child.

00:26:57.150 --> 00:27:00.000
But I tried to have other
characters in the story come in

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:03.120
and show how much they love
the Cinderella character,

00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:07.530
how much they think she's this
wonderful child, which she is.

00:27:07.530 --> 00:27:10.180
From Agnes's perspective, they
just have this disconnect.

00:27:10.180 --> 00:27:12.900
So that was what I was
trying to go for so that you

00:27:12.900 --> 00:27:17.280
can understand how Agnes was
not the best stepparent to her,

00:27:17.280 --> 00:27:20.310
but you could also see that
it's not Cinderella's fault

00:27:20.310 --> 00:27:24.002
that other people adore her
and think she's the best thing.

00:27:24.002 --> 00:27:25.710
MICHELLE KAUFMANN:
But I think she's also

00:27:25.710 --> 00:27:29.720
described at some point as
almost a vessel for anyone

00:27:29.720 --> 00:27:32.430
that she comes in contact
with because she is maybe

00:27:32.430 --> 00:27:37.640
less three dimensional than one
might imagine that people could

00:27:37.640 --> 00:27:41.204
put their own desires of
who she should be upon her.

00:27:41.204 --> 00:27:43.620
DANIELLE TELLER: Yeah, although
that was more a commentary

00:27:43.620 --> 00:27:45.000
on celebrity.

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:46.920
So what I was
thinking of there is

00:27:46.920 --> 00:27:49.860
how we admire these
gorgeous human beings

00:27:49.860 --> 00:27:53.520
in Hollywood or elsewhere
or like Princess Diana.

00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:56.575
When I was a kid, people got
up in the middle of the night

00:27:56.575 --> 00:27:57.700
to watch the royal wedding.

00:27:57.700 --> 00:28:00.900
And it was such a big deal,
and we all got our haircut like

00:28:00.900 --> 00:28:01.220
that, and we all
wore the little-

00:28:01.220 --> 00:28:01.940
MICHELLE KAUFMANN:
Some of us still do.

00:28:01.940 --> 00:28:04.210
DANIELLE TELLER:
--frilly colored shirts.

00:28:04.210 --> 00:28:05.918
MICHELLE KAUFMANN:
Not me, just a friend.

00:28:05.918 --> 00:28:07.000
[LAUGHING]

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:09.600
DANIELLE TELLER: So we all
wanted to dress like her.

00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:11.183
But we didn't know
anything about her.

00:28:11.183 --> 00:28:12.690
I mean, she was a celebrity.

00:28:12.690 --> 00:28:13.767
She was an unknown.

00:28:13.767 --> 00:28:14.850
She was a blank parchment.

00:28:14.850 --> 00:28:18.750
She was that person that we all
had these longings, these sort

00:28:18.750 --> 00:28:22.830
of inchoate longings
that we projected

00:28:22.830 --> 00:28:26.571
at her or at movie stars.

00:28:26.571 --> 00:28:28.320
But it's not about who
they are as people.

00:28:28.320 --> 00:28:32.997
It's really about our own
desires and our own longings.

00:28:32.997 --> 00:28:35.080
MICHELLE KAUFMANN: So who
I loved most in the book

00:28:35.080 --> 00:28:36.620
is our main character Agnes.

00:28:36.620 --> 00:28:37.420
She's so strong.

00:28:37.420 --> 00:28:38.830
She's so resilient.

00:28:38.830 --> 00:28:42.400
She fights so hard for what she
believes in and for the people

00:28:42.400 --> 00:28:44.230
that she loves.

00:28:44.230 --> 00:28:47.680
She says at one point in the
book to her two daughters,

00:28:47.680 --> 00:28:51.820
every woman serves a master be
it an overlord or a husband.

00:28:51.820 --> 00:28:53.920
And she is fortunate
if he does not

00:28:53.920 --> 00:28:56.482
beat her or treat her cruelly.

00:28:56.482 --> 00:28:58.792
Everything you
have I got for you

00:28:58.792 --> 00:29:01.070
either through
marriage or hard work.

00:29:01.070 --> 00:29:03.350
There is no alternative.

00:29:03.350 --> 00:29:08.540
The men in this novel are
often careless and even cruel

00:29:08.540 --> 00:29:11.940
while the women show
resilience and care.

00:29:11.940 --> 00:29:15.116
Can you talk about your choice
of the writing of characters

00:29:15.116 --> 00:29:17.890
that way?

00:29:17.890 --> 00:29:22.060
DANIELLE TELLER: So I'm not
sure there's such a stark line

00:29:22.060 --> 00:29:23.740
between the men and the women.

00:29:23.740 --> 00:29:26.530
But certainly, Cinderella is a
story about women and women's

00:29:26.530 --> 00:29:27.190
lives.

00:29:27.190 --> 00:29:30.620
And throughout the
world and over history,

00:29:30.620 --> 00:29:33.850
women have often been treated
much more like possessions

00:29:33.850 --> 00:29:36.370
than like real people.

00:29:36.370 --> 00:29:39.760
Even though the women lived
within a very narrow sphere,

00:29:39.760 --> 00:29:43.030
I wanted to show the
full sort of richness

00:29:43.030 --> 00:29:46.810
of their lives and
their characters.

00:29:46.810 --> 00:29:49.390
But I mean, they're
not all great people.

00:29:49.390 --> 00:29:51.280
In fact, some of the
people who torture

00:29:51.280 --> 00:29:54.610
Agnes the most-- there's
her boss the nurse when

00:29:54.610 --> 00:29:58.220
she's a kid who's
pretty evil toward her.

00:29:58.220 --> 00:30:00.340
And then much of
her disappointment

00:30:00.340 --> 00:30:04.790
comes from the abbess who
she at first admires so much.

00:30:04.790 --> 00:30:08.330
And so the women are certainly
not perfect characters.

00:30:08.330 --> 00:30:11.320
And I think that the men are--
they are a little bit more side

00:30:11.320 --> 00:30:14.110
characters because it
is a story about women.

00:30:14.110 --> 00:30:16.680
But I think that they are
also very, very complicated.

00:30:16.680 --> 00:30:22.640
And part of why I think we
see them as more negative

00:30:22.640 --> 00:30:25.420
is again because we're seeing
them through Agnes's eyes.

00:30:25.420 --> 00:30:28.150
And she had a very complicated
relationship with men

00:30:28.150 --> 00:30:31.960
because she lives in a society
where it's impossible for her

00:30:31.960 --> 00:30:34.190
to have a relationship
of equals with a man.

00:30:34.190 --> 00:30:36.070
It's just not set up that way.

00:30:36.070 --> 00:30:37.330
And she knows it.

00:30:37.330 --> 00:30:39.220
And she really resents
the fact that they

00:30:39.220 --> 00:30:41.590
have so much more
freedom and so many

00:30:41.590 --> 00:30:43.580
more entitlements than she has.

00:30:43.580 --> 00:30:45.130
But at the same
time, she needs them

00:30:45.130 --> 00:30:48.310
to be able to survive, to
be able to get ahead and do

00:30:48.310 --> 00:30:50.140
what she wants in her life.

00:30:50.140 --> 00:30:53.230
And so she's got this
complex relationship

00:30:53.230 --> 00:30:56.650
where when she feels any sort
of tenderness toward a man,

00:30:56.650 --> 00:30:59.660
it feels to her a little
bit like weakness.

00:30:59.660 --> 00:31:02.687
And I don't know if maybe it
was hard to pick up in the book.

00:31:02.687 --> 00:31:04.270
But I was trying to
get at, especially

00:31:04.270 --> 00:31:07.360
with her husband,
when she marries

00:31:07.360 --> 00:31:10.870
Cinderella's father, that he's
completely besotted with her.

00:31:10.870 --> 00:31:12.340
He really loves her.

00:31:12.340 --> 00:31:14.550
But she can't admit
that to herself

00:31:14.550 --> 00:31:17.120
because it's just
too complicated.

00:31:17.120 --> 00:31:20.590
She needs to like hold that at
arm's length and sort of stick

00:31:20.590 --> 00:31:26.090
with I need to take care of me,
I need to take care of my kids.

00:31:26.090 --> 00:31:30.740
I can't let myself get too soft.

00:31:30.740 --> 00:31:32.480
MICHELLE KAUFMANN:
Women mentoring women

00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:34.975
is definitely something I
think a lot of us think about.

00:31:34.975 --> 00:31:37.016
It's certainly something
that I think about a lot

00:31:37.016 --> 00:31:38.950
and I've benefited from.

00:31:38.950 --> 00:31:43.790
And I try to actively
make time to help with--

00:31:43.790 --> 00:31:45.851
it's definitely a
theme in the book

00:31:45.851 --> 00:31:49.667
both in really beautiful
and powerful positive ways,

00:31:49.667 --> 00:31:55.740
but also in hurtful,
tragic ways.

00:31:55.740 --> 00:31:57.464
Can you talk about
that a little bit?

00:31:57.464 --> 00:31:58.380
DANIELLE TELLER: Sure.

00:32:01.163 --> 00:32:02.720
So Cinderella's--
not Cinderella.

00:32:02.720 --> 00:32:05.620
Agnes, the stepmother,
is born a peasant.

00:32:05.620 --> 00:32:09.820
And so she has no
access to education.

00:32:09.820 --> 00:32:11.610
But she learns to
read when she's

00:32:11.610 --> 00:32:16.690
a servant when this elderly,
very wealthy, very powerful

00:32:16.690 --> 00:32:20.800
countess, who maybe is somewhat
eccentric for the times--

00:32:20.800 --> 00:32:23.120
she believes in
girls' potential.

00:32:23.120 --> 00:32:26.650
And so she teaches her to read.

00:32:26.650 --> 00:32:31.690
And it's not a coincidence that
the daughter of this countess

00:32:31.690 --> 00:32:36.760
is the very powerful abbess
who is the fairy godmother, not

00:32:36.760 --> 00:32:37.600
magical.

00:32:37.600 --> 00:32:40.840
But she's the godmother
figure in the story.

00:32:40.840 --> 00:32:45.110
And young Agnes, when
she's a teenager,

00:32:45.110 --> 00:32:50.560
she's really drawn to this very
smart and charismatic woman who

00:32:50.560 --> 00:32:53.470
is one of the most
powerful people in a very

00:32:53.470 --> 00:32:56.210
religious country at the time.

00:32:56.210 --> 00:32:58.030
And so she wants to follow her.

00:32:58.030 --> 00:33:00.100
Her heart just
goes to this woman.

00:33:00.100 --> 00:33:03.580
And she decides that she
wants to join the church

00:33:03.580 --> 00:33:07.960
and to follow in her footsteps.

00:33:07.960 --> 00:33:09.860
But what she can't see--

00:33:09.860 --> 00:33:11.392
I mean, there's
a class division.

00:33:11.392 --> 00:33:12.850
And so she doesn't
quite understand

00:33:12.850 --> 00:33:15.040
the way in which being
of such low birth

00:33:15.040 --> 00:33:17.330
means there was never
any chance of this.

00:33:17.330 --> 00:33:19.930
But also, I wanted
for the abbess

00:33:19.930 --> 00:33:22.720
to be a character who has
achieved great things,

00:33:22.720 --> 00:33:24.970
but then kind of pulled up
the ladder after herself.

00:33:27.990 --> 00:33:30.400
When I was in
medical school back

00:33:30.400 --> 00:33:35.274
in the early 90s, some of the
women doctors I really admired,

00:33:35.274 --> 00:33:36.940
especially in fields
that were very male

00:33:36.940 --> 00:33:40.480
dominated at the time like
surgery and cardiology,

00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:43.660
who were really mean.

00:33:43.660 --> 00:33:49.080
And at the time, we said, my
fellow female students and I,

00:33:49.080 --> 00:33:51.670
they had to be that
way in order to make it

00:33:51.670 --> 00:33:53.920
in such a tough field
at such a tough time.

00:33:53.920 --> 00:33:56.460
If they hadn't had that
sort of personality or that

00:33:56.460 --> 00:33:59.530
like rough exterior,
that they would not

00:33:59.530 --> 00:34:02.090
have been able to make it.

00:34:02.090 --> 00:34:06.710
And I think that the abbess is
one of those sorts of people.

00:34:06.710 --> 00:34:09.960
But as I've gotten older, I've
also felt like didn't they

00:34:09.960 --> 00:34:12.370
owe it a little bit to the
women who came behind them

00:34:12.370 --> 00:34:15.699
not to pull up the ladder
quite so hard behind them.

00:34:15.699 --> 00:34:19.000
And I wondered how much
being a powerful woman

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:22.540
in a male-dominated
world makes you

00:34:22.540 --> 00:34:24.430
feel even better about
yourself than if there

00:34:24.430 --> 00:34:25.929
were a lot of other
successful women

00:34:25.929 --> 00:34:28.239
because maybe that makes
you even more special

00:34:28.239 --> 00:34:30.010
that you're the only one.

00:34:30.010 --> 00:34:31.850
You're the only one
who could make it.

00:34:31.850 --> 00:34:34.650
So anyways, that's
this character.

00:34:34.650 --> 00:34:37.760
She fulfills a bit of that rule.

00:34:37.760 --> 00:34:39.600
MICHELLE KAUFMANN: I love that.

00:34:39.600 --> 00:34:40.969
So good.

00:34:40.969 --> 00:34:42.219
And it's so true too.

00:34:42.219 --> 00:34:44.710
There is really a truth in that.

00:34:44.710 --> 00:34:46.030
I want to open this up.

00:34:46.030 --> 00:34:48.033
Do folks here have
questions for Danielle?

00:34:48.033 --> 00:34:49.699
I don't want to
dominate her completely,

00:34:49.699 --> 00:34:51.969
although I have plenty
more to ask her.

00:34:51.969 --> 00:34:54.134
But yes?

00:34:54.134 --> 00:34:56.060
AUDIENCE: Hello,
thank you for coming.

00:34:56.060 --> 00:34:57.650
Interesting discussion.

00:34:57.650 --> 00:35:00.370
So the question I wanted to
ask was around your process.

00:35:00.370 --> 00:35:04.746
So did you write like on the
weekends, or in the mornings,

00:35:04.746 --> 00:35:06.000
or evenings?

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:09.510
Can you give us any
insights to that?

00:35:09.510 --> 00:35:12.670
DANIELLE TELLER:
Sure, so I had started

00:35:12.670 --> 00:35:14.899
working on this book
when I was still working

00:35:14.899 --> 00:35:15.940
full time as a physician.

00:35:15.940 --> 00:35:19.540
But then I later quit and
became a full-time writer.

00:35:19.540 --> 00:35:21.669
So at first, I was mostly
working on airplanes,

00:35:21.669 --> 00:35:23.335
flying back and forth
across the country

00:35:23.335 --> 00:35:26.940
because I was working in Boston
and living in California,

00:35:26.940 --> 00:35:28.170
which is kind of nuts.

00:35:28.170 --> 00:35:30.970
And I read a lot of books
about the Middle Ages

00:35:30.970 --> 00:35:33.640
to try to get some of
those details right.

00:35:33.640 --> 00:35:36.400
And then when I started
writing full time,

00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:38.440
I really tried to
treat it like a job

00:35:38.440 --> 00:35:40.850
just like when I had to
go into my workplace.

00:35:40.850 --> 00:35:43.185
So I have the luxury of
being able to start later

00:35:43.185 --> 00:35:43.810
in the morning.

00:35:43.810 --> 00:35:46.990
I get to go exercise first
thing in the morning.

00:35:46.990 --> 00:35:49.780
Nobody's paying attention
to when I actually

00:35:49.780 --> 00:35:51.080
get onto my computer.

00:35:51.080 --> 00:35:54.130
But I really try to sort
of set aside those hours

00:35:54.130 --> 00:35:58.535
from sort of mid-morning until
time to start making dinner

00:35:58.535 --> 00:36:00.870
and just work through.

00:36:00.870 --> 00:36:03.950
At least for me, it's
not possible to be

00:36:03.950 --> 00:36:09.020
productive and creative
through that entire period.

00:36:09.020 --> 00:36:11.250
When I feel like I'm
running out of steam,

00:36:11.250 --> 00:36:13.880
I try to spend time doing
other things like research

00:36:13.880 --> 00:36:16.360
for other projects,
or for that project,

00:36:16.360 --> 00:36:21.530
or sort of like reading
on backgrounds so

00:36:21.530 --> 00:36:23.297
that it's still
part of my work day.

00:36:23.297 --> 00:36:25.130
Because I think it's
really easy as a writer

00:36:25.130 --> 00:36:27.980
to just procrastinate
and for things

00:36:27.980 --> 00:36:30.919
to go year after year
without getting done.

00:36:30.919 --> 00:36:33.460
MICHELLE KAUFMANN: So the book
was set in a medieval setting.

00:36:33.460 --> 00:36:35.200
So you did quite
a bit of research

00:36:35.200 --> 00:36:37.350
I'm imagining for this book.

00:36:37.350 --> 00:36:39.335
I know you visited castles--

00:36:39.335 --> 00:36:40.710
hearing about some
of your trips.

00:36:40.710 --> 00:36:43.084
Can you talk a little bit
about that part of the process,

00:36:43.084 --> 00:36:44.650
the research part for this?

00:36:44.650 --> 00:36:47.530
DANIELLE TELLER: Yeah, so mostly
I read books in the beginning

00:36:47.530 --> 00:36:49.540
just about what medieval
villages were like,

00:36:49.540 --> 00:36:51.664
what medieval castles were
like, that sort of thing

00:36:51.664 --> 00:36:53.440
to have a sense of the life.

00:36:53.440 --> 00:36:56.590
But a lot of it was
on Google and YouTube.

00:36:56.590 --> 00:36:58.780
It's amazing how much
you can find out.

00:36:58.780 --> 00:37:01.570
There are people who
are hobbyists who

00:37:01.570 --> 00:37:03.490
brew beer in a medieval style.

00:37:03.490 --> 00:37:05.950
You can actually go on
YouTube and watch somebody

00:37:05.950 --> 00:37:07.480
making medieval beer.

00:37:07.480 --> 00:37:10.000
And so I've learned
so much by people

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:14.410
who have done this research
for their own amusement.

00:37:14.410 --> 00:37:15.900
Yeah, so that was
a big part of it.

00:37:15.900 --> 00:37:17.800
And one of the
things I discovered

00:37:17.800 --> 00:37:20.110
when I was doing the
research is that there's not

00:37:20.110 --> 00:37:22.960
much known about the poor
people from the Middle Ages.

00:37:22.960 --> 00:37:24.880
So the rich people, who
could read and write,

00:37:24.880 --> 00:37:27.997
we have fairly good records
at least of who married who,

00:37:27.997 --> 00:37:30.080
and whose kid was who, and
all that sort of stuff.

00:37:30.080 --> 00:37:33.250
But for the illiterate
poor, nobody

00:37:33.250 --> 00:37:34.720
was writing anything about them.

00:37:34.720 --> 00:37:36.880
And so we actually
know very little.

00:37:36.880 --> 00:37:39.270
What we do know is
mostly from having

00:37:39.270 --> 00:37:41.560
exhumed bones from
graveyards, and looking

00:37:41.560 --> 00:37:43.750
at what ages children died,
and trying to figure out

00:37:43.750 --> 00:37:45.230
what children died from.

00:37:45.230 --> 00:37:48.860
And the few tax records
that existed at the time

00:37:48.860 --> 00:37:51.250
tells a little bit
about the villages

00:37:51.250 --> 00:37:56.470
and so on, like who had to
pay taxes on how many oxen.

00:37:56.470 --> 00:37:58.060
And that's kind of
it, which actually

00:37:58.060 --> 00:37:59.310
was very comforting to me.

00:37:59.310 --> 00:38:01.060
Because I was really
worried about getting

00:38:01.060 --> 00:38:02.500
historical details wrong.

00:38:02.500 --> 00:38:05.607
And then I realized, well,
even the historians are arguing

00:38:05.607 --> 00:38:06.815
about what actually happened.

00:38:06.815 --> 00:38:10.615
So I felt a little more
relaxed after that.

00:38:10.615 --> 00:38:11.990
MICHELLE KAUFMANN:
Do other folks

00:38:11.990 --> 00:38:14.220
have questions for Danielle?

00:38:14.220 --> 00:38:16.560
I have one.

00:38:16.560 --> 00:38:19.590
I was wondering about and
thinking about this discussion.

00:38:19.590 --> 00:38:22.510
So you have children
and step-children.

00:38:22.510 --> 00:38:28.010
If they were to write a
book with you included,

00:38:28.010 --> 00:38:30.039
what do think the
title would be?

00:38:30.039 --> 00:38:31.580
DANIELLE TELLER: Of
my book about me?

00:38:31.580 --> 00:38:33.080
MICHELLE KAUFMANN: Yeah,
written from your children's

00:38:33.080 --> 00:38:34.060
perspective.

00:38:34.060 --> 00:38:37.400
DANIELLE TELLER: It would
be "What's for Dinner?"

00:38:37.400 --> 00:38:40.522
[LAUGHING]

00:38:41.420 --> 00:38:41.935
I'm serious.

00:38:41.935 --> 00:38:43.460
I mean, that's how
kids are, right?

00:38:43.460 --> 00:38:47.120
They don't really see
their parents as people.

00:38:47.120 --> 00:38:49.730
The story would go like this--

00:38:49.730 --> 00:38:51.870
once upon a time, there
was this nice lady.

00:38:51.870 --> 00:38:53.790
She cooked really good food.

00:38:53.790 --> 00:38:54.290
I love her.

00:38:54.290 --> 00:38:54.790
The end.

00:38:54.790 --> 00:38:57.269
[LAUGHING]

00:38:57.269 --> 00:38:59.060
MICHELLE KAUFMANN:
That's kind of I think--

00:38:59.060 --> 00:39:01.265
DANIELLE TELLER:
And as it should be.

00:39:01.265 --> 00:39:03.040
They've got their
own stuff going on.

00:39:03.040 --> 00:39:04.165
MICHELLE KAUFMANN: They do.

00:39:04.165 --> 00:39:05.456
So what are you working on now?

00:39:07.364 --> 00:39:08.780
DANIELLE TELLER:
I mentioned I had

00:39:08.780 --> 00:39:11.050
this novel in the back
of my mind for 10 years.

00:39:11.050 --> 00:39:14.810
Well, so I finally got
around to writing that.

00:39:14.810 --> 00:39:16.370
So it's not historical fiction.

00:39:16.370 --> 00:39:20.060
It's actually set in 2003,
which isn't that historical.

00:39:20.060 --> 00:39:23.450
And it takes place
in Canada in Toronto

00:39:23.450 --> 00:39:25.610
during-- there was a big
blackout in the northeast

00:39:25.610 --> 00:39:27.109
of the United States
and a big chunk

00:39:27.109 --> 00:39:30.230
of Canada in August of 2003.

00:39:30.230 --> 00:39:32.570
And the inspiration
for the story

00:39:32.570 --> 00:39:35.840
was the poem "The Love
Song of J. Alfred Prufrock"

00:39:35.840 --> 00:39:40.070
by TS Eliot, which is one
of my very favorite poems.

00:39:40.070 --> 00:39:42.890
And if you're not
familiar with it,

00:39:42.890 --> 00:39:46.580
it's narrated by a
character who is approaching

00:39:46.580 --> 00:39:50.810
or in middle age, who has a
big decision, a challenging

00:39:50.810 --> 00:39:52.250
decision to make.

00:39:52.250 --> 00:39:55.040
And it sounds like it's
of a romantic nature,

00:39:55.040 --> 00:39:58.640
though we never find out
exactly what this choice is.

00:39:58.640 --> 00:40:00.380
But what's so tragic
about the poem

00:40:00.380 --> 00:40:04.280
is that he knows even before
he made the choice, that he

00:40:04.280 --> 00:40:06.177
doesn't have the guts to do it.

00:40:06.177 --> 00:40:08.510
And the reason is that he
lives such a comfortable life.

00:40:08.510 --> 00:40:10.610
He's got this very
upper-middle-class

00:40:10.610 --> 00:40:11.390
comfortable life.

00:40:11.390 --> 00:40:14.300
Like I've measured out my
days with coffee spoons,

00:40:14.300 --> 00:40:16.220
women come and go,
speaking of Michelangelo,

00:40:16.220 --> 00:40:20.190
all those lines that talk about
the sprinklers on the streets.

00:40:20.190 --> 00:40:22.010
It's just this beautiful,
comfortable life.

00:40:22.010 --> 00:40:25.250
And he just cannot smash that
all to bits to do this thing

00:40:25.250 --> 00:40:30.870
that he wishes he might
have the courage to do.

00:40:30.870 --> 00:40:35.420
And so in my story,
the Prufrock character

00:40:35.420 --> 00:40:38.300
is a woman in her 60s,
who's planning the birthday

00:40:38.300 --> 00:40:39.780
party of her mother.

00:40:39.780 --> 00:40:43.380
And the other main character
is her daughter-in-law.

00:40:43.380 --> 00:40:45.650
And we sort of watch
their parallel lives.

00:40:45.650 --> 00:40:49.490
Even though they're 25,
30 years apart in age,

00:40:49.490 --> 00:40:53.060
they have very similar
trajectories of their lives.

00:40:53.060 --> 00:40:55.730
And they come together
at a certain point,

00:40:55.730 --> 00:40:57.790
and they take very
different paths.

00:40:57.790 --> 00:41:01.310
So the older woman is the one
who didn't have the courage

00:41:01.310 --> 00:41:02.410
to take a chance.

00:41:02.410 --> 00:41:06.530
And the younger woman sort
of smashes everything apart.

00:41:06.530 --> 00:41:08.980
She leaves her
husband for a woman

00:41:08.980 --> 00:41:14.560
she's fallen in love with at
work and just creates havoc.

00:41:14.560 --> 00:41:16.392
And it sort of
follows both of them

00:41:16.392 --> 00:41:18.100
through the blackout
where they each have

00:41:18.100 --> 00:41:21.220
their sort of separate
epiphanies about their choices

00:41:21.220 --> 00:41:24.550
and what they've
done in the world.

00:41:24.550 --> 00:41:26.770
And the reason I chose to
set it during the blackout

00:41:26.770 --> 00:41:29.860
is that my brothers were both
living in Toronto at the time.

00:41:29.860 --> 00:41:33.400
And they told me
about how amazing

00:41:33.400 --> 00:41:36.010
it was when all the lights
went out that people actually

00:41:36.010 --> 00:41:38.932
came out of their houses
and onto their stoops.

00:41:38.932 --> 00:41:40.390
And they talked to
their neighbors.

00:41:40.390 --> 00:41:41.800
And people had barbecues.

00:41:41.800 --> 00:41:45.490
They had block parties basically
because the only way you could

00:41:45.490 --> 00:41:47.860
eat was to grill your food.

00:41:47.860 --> 00:41:51.657
And so I think in a blackout it
can go in very different ways.

00:41:51.657 --> 00:41:53.740
I mean, there could have
been rioting and looting.

00:41:53.740 --> 00:41:55.823
And it could have been
horrible, but it turned out

00:41:55.823 --> 00:41:59.590
that people volunteered
to go direct traffic.

00:41:59.590 --> 00:42:02.000
It really brought
the city together.

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:06.130
And so I think for the J.
Alfred Prufrock character,

00:42:06.130 --> 00:42:07.630
she's lived her life in fear.

00:42:07.630 --> 00:42:10.429
And then she sees that humanity
does have this goodness.

00:42:10.429 --> 00:42:12.220
And I think that that
really sort of causes

00:42:12.220 --> 00:42:14.720
her to realize that maybe the
fears she's been living under

00:42:14.720 --> 00:42:16.136
was misplaced.

00:42:16.136 --> 00:42:17.970
MICHELLE KAUFMANN:
Oh, it sounds so good.

00:42:17.970 --> 00:42:19.178
When is it going to come out?

00:42:19.178 --> 00:42:20.900
DANIELLE TELLER:
When I get it done.

00:42:20.900 --> 00:42:22.816
MICHELLE KAUFMANN: We'll
look forward to that.

00:42:22.816 --> 00:42:25.800
So unless folks have other
thoughts or questions--

00:42:25.800 --> 00:42:26.300
yes?

00:42:29.222 --> 00:42:32.640
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:42:32.640 --> 00:42:36.140
MICHELLE KAUFMANN: Oh yes, I
can repeat the question for you.

00:42:36.140 --> 00:42:38.960
If you were to write
about another fairy tale

00:42:38.960 --> 00:42:41.700
and take on a
different perspective,

00:42:41.700 --> 00:42:44.465
what would that be?

00:42:44.465 --> 00:42:46.590
DANIELLE TELLER: So that's
a really great question.

00:42:46.590 --> 00:42:48.680
I have thought about it.

00:42:48.680 --> 00:42:50.930
I haven't come up
with a great answer,

00:42:50.930 --> 00:42:55.200
one of my favorite fairy tales
is "Beauty and the Beast."

00:42:55.200 --> 00:42:57.600
I really like that Belle
has a little more agency

00:42:57.600 --> 00:43:00.300
than Cinderella.

00:43:00.300 --> 00:43:04.440
And she's really making choices
for other people in her life.

00:43:04.440 --> 00:43:07.530
So I like that fairy tale,
but the twist I haven't really

00:43:07.530 --> 00:43:10.430
come up with.

00:43:10.430 --> 00:43:12.300
So the original fairy
tale some people

00:43:12.300 --> 00:43:18.510
think us based on a man
who had hypertrichosis.

00:43:18.510 --> 00:43:22.200
So he had this very rare genetic
disease where he was basically

00:43:22.200 --> 00:43:23.480
covered in hair.

00:43:23.480 --> 00:43:24.990
So people with this
condition, they

00:43:24.990 --> 00:43:26.489
can grow hair all
over their bodies.

00:43:26.489 --> 00:43:28.860
And so his face was
all covered by hair,

00:43:28.860 --> 00:43:31.740
and he married this
beautiful woman.

00:43:31.740 --> 00:43:35.360
He was upper class in France
and married a beautiful woman.

00:43:35.360 --> 00:43:39.840
And so I love that story because
what I don't like about Beauty

00:43:39.840 --> 00:43:42.540
and the Beast is that
he turns into a prince,

00:43:42.540 --> 00:43:44.850
like literally he has to
turn into this babe for her

00:43:44.850 --> 00:43:47.580
to like really be like,
OK, now I'll marry you.

00:43:47.580 --> 00:43:49.350
But I really like
the idea that he

00:43:49.350 --> 00:43:51.660
becomes beautiful in
her eyes because she

00:43:51.660 --> 00:43:53.020
falls in love with him.

00:43:53.020 --> 00:43:54.840
So I've been playing with that.

00:43:54.840 --> 00:43:57.690
I haven't quite come up with
the right sort of take on it.

00:43:57.690 --> 00:43:59.760
But if I were to do
a twist, it would be

00:43:59.760 --> 00:44:01.530
that he doesn't turn beautiful.

00:44:01.530 --> 00:44:04.230
That she just sees
him as beautiful

00:44:04.230 --> 00:44:06.451
because she loves him so much.

00:44:06.451 --> 00:44:08.742
MICHELLE KAUFMANN: Yeah, you
should write that one too.

00:44:08.742 --> 00:44:10.125
That sounds good too.

00:44:10.125 --> 00:44:12.430
[LAUGHING]

00:44:12.430 --> 00:44:13.950
All right, well,
thank you so much.

00:44:13.950 --> 00:44:14.050
DANIELLE TELLER: Thank you.

00:44:14.050 --> 00:44:15.950
MICHELLE KAUFMANN: And thanks,
everybody, for joining us.

00:44:15.950 --> 00:44:18.050

00:44:18.050 --> 00:44:18.684
