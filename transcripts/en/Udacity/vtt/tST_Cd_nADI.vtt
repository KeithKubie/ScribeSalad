00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.600
The first statement is false. It is not true

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:04.840
that because of pair programming, we need twice as many

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:08.039
developers. In fact that there is some evidence that even

00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:11.700
though in pair programming we have two developers working together,

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.175
that the overall efficiency of the programmers is not really

00:00:15.175 --> 00:00:19.080
affected by use of this practice. In XP, code is

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.280
rarely changed after being written. This is also definitely false.

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:25.233
In fact in XP there is a lot of emphasis

00:00:25.233 --> 00:00:27.879
on change on the fact that the code can be changed,

00:00:27.879 --> 00:00:30.462
it can be resigned, because of the fact when we do

00:00:30.462 --> 00:00:32.793
that, we have a set of these cases that we can

00:00:32.793 --> 00:00:35.439
use to check right away that the code still works as

00:00:35.439 --> 00:00:39.850
expected. So again in XP, it's all about steering rather than

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:43.430
just driving down one fixed direction. And therefore, the code can

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:46.580
be changed. So this statement is false. It is definitely true

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:50.950
that XP follows the test driven development paradigm. In XP we first

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:53.320
write tests, and then we write the code, which is

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:55.980
exactly what TDD is about. It is not true that

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.740
the customer does not need to provide requirements in XP.

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:02.020
The customer does provide requirements in the form of user

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:04.879
stories, and the user stories are the starting point of

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:09.370
the development process. Finally, XP is definitely an iterative software

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:12.500
development process. In fact, we saw that XP is based

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.100
on subsequent iterations of the same cycle, in which we

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.110
select from a set of story cards, or user

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:21.270
stories, the stories that we want to implement in the

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.250
next iteration. Based on that we develop task cards,

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:26.060
and then we use the task cards to write this

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:28.400
case and then to write code. And we continue

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:31.140
this cycle in an iterative way until we are done

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.030
with all the story cards, and all the user

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.612
stories, so definitely XP is an iterative software development process.
