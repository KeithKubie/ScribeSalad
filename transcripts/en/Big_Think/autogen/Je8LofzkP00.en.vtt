00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:05.070
 
I was teaching at university of texas

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:05.080
I was teaching at university of texas
 

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:06.210
I was teaching at university of texas
and i was teaching a class and

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:06.220
and i was teaching a class and
 

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:09.089
and i was teaching a class and
interactive design and this was in the

00:00:09.089 --> 00:00:09.099
interactive design and this was in the
 

00:00:09.099 --> 00:00:11.909
interactive design and this was in the
sort of late 90s and the internet had

00:00:11.909 --> 00:00:11.919
sort of late 90s and the internet had
 

00:00:11.919 --> 00:00:13.409
sort of late 90s and the internet had
had gotten really big and my students

00:00:13.409 --> 00:00:13.419
had gotten really big and my students
 

00:00:13.419 --> 00:00:15.539
had gotten really big and my students
were grappling with notions of interface

00:00:15.539 --> 00:00:15.549
were grappling with notions of interface
 

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:17.010
were grappling with notions of interface
design and really trying to figure out

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:17.020
design and really trying to figure out
 

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:20.130
design and really trying to figure out
how to how do they engage users and so I

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:20.140
how to how do they engage users and so I
 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:22.140
how to how do they engage users and so I
brought in a project where we began to

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:22.150
brought in a project where we began to
 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:24.510
brought in a project where we began to
study games and the students began to

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:24.520
study games and the students began to
 

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:26.520
study games and the students began to
design and redesign games as a way to

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:26.530
design and redesign games as a way to
 

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:28.440
design and redesign games as a way to
understand what is good interactive

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:28.450
understand what is good interactive
 

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:30.840
understand what is good interactive
design and that is the first time that

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:30.850
design and that is the first time that
 

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:32.790
design and that is the first time that
I'd actually brought games into my own

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:32.800
I'd actually brought games into my own
 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.950
I'd actually brought games into my own
classroom space and the first time that

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:34.960
classroom space and the first time that
 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:36.720
classroom space and the first time that
I took people who'd never done game

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:36.730
I took people who'd never done game
 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:38.940
I took people who'd never done game
design and put them in the role of a

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:38.950
design and put them in the role of a
 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:42.479
design and put them in the role of a
game designer and it was a huge moment

00:00:42.479 --> 00:00:42.489
game designer and it was a huge moment
 

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:45.510
game designer and it was a huge moment
of discovery for me because my students

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:45.520
of discovery for me because my students
 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:47.880
of discovery for me because my students
learn more about how to engage an

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:47.890
learn more about how to engage an
 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:52.229
learn more about how to engage an
audience how to really communicate and

00:00:52.229 --> 00:00:52.239
audience how to really communicate and
 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:55.080
audience how to really communicate and
and how to create really interesting

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:55.090
and how to create really interesting
 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:58.500
and how to create really interesting
unusual kinds of spaces when they used

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:58.510
unusual kinds of spaces when they used
 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:00.569
unusual kinds of spaces when they used
game design as a starting point even

00:01:00.569 --> 00:01:00.579
game design as a starting point even
 

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:01.560
game design as a starting point even
though they weren't designing games

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:01.570
though they weren't designing games
 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:03.660
though they weren't designing games
eventually the process of thinking like

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:03.670
eventually the process of thinking like
 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:05.459
eventually the process of thinking like
a game designer gave them a whole tool

00:01:05.459 --> 00:01:05.469
a game designer gave them a whole tool
 

00:01:05.469 --> 00:01:07.680
a game designer gave them a whole tool
sets toolset that they hadn't had

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:07.690
sets toolset that they hadn't had
 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:11.130
sets toolset that they hadn't had
previously and so that sort of set me

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:11.140
previously and so that sort of set me
 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.050
previously and so that sort of set me
along this path where I began to say you

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:13.060
along this path where I began to say you
 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:14.460
along this path where I began to say you
know there's something just interesting

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:14.470
know there's something just interesting
 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:16.770
know there's something just interesting
in this act of teaching people to design

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:16.780
in this act of teaching people to design
 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:18.960
in this act of teaching people to design
games and then I begin to work with kids

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:18.970
games and then I begin to work with kids
 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:22.260
games and then I begin to work with kids
and one of the most interesting thing

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:22.270
and one of the most interesting thing
 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:23.670
and one of the most interesting thing
that happens when you work with young

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:23.680
that happens when you work with young
 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:27.450
that happens when you work with young
people in designing games is how deep

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:27.460
people in designing games is how deep
 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:29.640
people in designing games is how deep
they go into the content and so this is

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:29.650
they go into the content and so this is
 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:31.109
they go into the content and so this is
this question of where the math and

00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:31.119
this question of where the math and
 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:35.890
this question of where the math and
science stuff might come in

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:35.900
 
 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:38.590
 
when we look at kids and we talked about

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:38.600
when we look at kids and we talked about
 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.020
when we look at kids and we talked about
that definition of who is a gamer it's

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.030
that definition of who is a gamer it's
 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:43.150
that definition of who is a gamer it's
actually a really old definition there

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:43.160
actually a really old definition there
 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:45.190
actually a really old definition there
it used to be a time when only a certain

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:45.200
it used to be a time when only a certain
 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.230
it used to be a time when only a certain
population of kids played games they

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:47.240
population of kids played games they
 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:48.910
population of kids played games they
tended to be boys and I tended to be

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920
tended to be boys and I tended to be
 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:50.440
tended to be boys and I tended to be
kind of geeky boys that were hidden away

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:50.450
kind of geeky boys that were hidden away
 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:52.690
kind of geeky boys that were hidden away
in their basement the truth is today

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:52.700
in their basement the truth is today
 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:54.550
in their basement the truth is today
when you look at who is playing games

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:54.560
when you look at who is playing games
 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.590
when you look at who is playing games
particularly younger kids up to about

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:56.600
particularly younger kids up to about
 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.530
particularly younger kids up to about
sixth or seventh grade it's all kids and

00:01:59.530 --> 00:01:59.540
sixth or seventh grade it's all kids and
 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:01.240
sixth or seventh grade it's all kids and
most kids don't self-identify themselves

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:01.250
most kids don't self-identify themselves
 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:04.180
most kids don't self-identify themselves
as gamers if you ask them about that

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:04.190
as gamers if you ask them about that
 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:06.430
as gamers if you ask them about that
identity it's just something that they

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:06.440
identity it's just something that they
 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:09.280
identity it's just something that they
do so there's an assumption when we

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:09.290
do so there's an assumption when we
 

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:10.990
do so there's an assumption when we
recruit kids for the school that that

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000
recruit kids for the school that that
 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.820
recruit kids for the school that that
all kids have to a greater or lesser

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830
all kids have to a greater or lesser
 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:14.830
all kids have to a greater or lesser
degree some experience playing games and

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840
degree some experience playing games and
 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.110
degree some experience playing games and
an interest in playing games the school

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120
an interest in playing games the school
 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.510
an interest in playing games the school
is not excuse me it's not a vocational

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:19.520
is not excuse me it's not a vocational
 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.370
is not excuse me it's not a vocational
school that's intended to graduate game

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:21.380
school that's intended to graduate game
 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:23.860
school that's intended to graduate game
designers so that isn't actually any way

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870
designers so that isn't actually any way
 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:27.040
designers so that isn't actually any way
that we talk about the school and so the

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:27.050
that we talk about the school and so the
 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:29.310
that we talk about the school and so the
kids that we get our kids that are

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:29.320
kids that we get our kids that are
 

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:34.150
kids that we get our kids that are
deeply interested in a school that might

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.160
deeply interested in a school that might
 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:35.380
deeply interested in a school that might
feel a little bit different than a

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390
feel a little bit different than a
 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:37.630
feel a little bit different than a
traditional school they tend to be

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:37.640
traditional school they tend to be
 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.470
traditional school they tend to be
really creative kids that are interested

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480
really creative kids that are interested
 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:42.759
really creative kids that are interested
in ideas that they'll have a chance to

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:42.769
in ideas that they'll have a chance to
 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:45.670
in ideas that they'll have a chance to
design stuff and make stuff their kids

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680
design stuff and make stuff their kids
 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.530
design stuff and make stuff their kids
that tend to be you know in some sense

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540
that tend to be you know in some sense
 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:51.220
that tend to be you know in some sense
high-performing and having strong

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230
high-performing and having strong
 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:53.199
high-performing and having strong
interests and those interests don't

00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:53.209
interests and those interests don't
 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:54.790
interests and those interests don't
necessarily have to be games but they

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:54.800
necessarily have to be games but they
 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:56.259
necessarily have to be games but they
might be interested in reading or they

00:02:56.259 --> 00:02:56.269
might be interested in reading or they
 

00:02:56.269 --> 00:02:57.670
might be interested in reading or they
might be interested in sports but their

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680
might be interested in sports but their
 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.830
might be interested in sports but their
kids that get passionate about something

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840
kids that get passionate about something
 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.020
kids that get passionate about something
and get excited about a school that

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.030
and get excited about a school that
 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:06.809
and get excited about a school that
might help them cultivate that passion

00:03:06.809 --> 00:03:06.819
 
 

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:08.819
 
so with the model at Quest is that the

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:08.829
so with the model at Quest is that the
 

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:10.530
so with the model at Quest is that the
teachers collaborate with game designers

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:10.540
teachers collaborate with game designers
 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:12.420
teachers collaborate with game designers
to design the curriculum so there's no

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:12.430
to design the curriculum so there's no
 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:14.160
to design the curriculum so there's no
expectation that teachers have to be

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.170
expectation that teachers have to be
 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:15.809
expectation that teachers have to be
game designers in the way that there's

00:03:15.809 --> 00:03:15.819
game designers in the way that there's
 

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:17.399
game designers in the way that there's
no expectation that the game designers

00:03:17.399 --> 00:03:17.409
no expectation that the game designers
 

00:03:17.409 --> 00:03:18.330
no expectation that the game designers
are going to be in the classroom

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340
are going to be in the classroom
 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.539
are going to be in the classroom
teaching day to day with the kids so the

00:03:21.539 --> 00:03:21.549
teaching day to day with the kids so the
 

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:23.459
teaching day to day with the kids so the
teachers that we recruited mostly came

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:23.469
teachers that we recruited mostly came
 

00:03:23.469 --> 00:03:25.229
teachers that we recruited mostly came
from the public school system we have a

00:03:25.229 --> 00:03:25.239
from the public school system we have a
 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:26.429
from the public school system we have a
couple that taught at private schools

00:03:26.429 --> 00:03:26.439
couple that taught at private schools
 

00:03:26.439 --> 00:03:30.300
couple that taught at private schools
previously none of them had a game

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.310
previously none of them had a game
 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:32.970
previously none of them had a game
design background a few of them had an

were strong collaborators had worked in

contexts where collaboration was key all
 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:46.770
contexts where collaboration was key all
of them were deeply interested in the

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:46.780
of them were deeply interested in the
 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:49.170
of them were deeply interested in the
craft of learning and and how to really

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:49.180
craft of learning and and how to really
 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:51.720
craft of learning and and how to really
work with kids and all of them were open

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:51.730
work with kids and all of them were open
 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:54.119
work with kids and all of them were open
to the idea of being a curriculum

00:03:54.119 --> 00:03:54.129
to the idea of being a curriculum
 

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:56.849

and trying to see where this model could

00:03:58.379 --> 00:03:58.389
and trying to see where this model could
 

00:03:58.389 --> 00:04:02.960
and trying to see where this model could
could really take learning for kids

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970
 
 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:05.210
 
I would say that it's it's not so much

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220
I would say that it's it's not so much
 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:08.870
I would say that it's it's not so much
among our parents because any open house

really clear how we're talking about

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:14.430
really clear how we're talking about
 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:16.880
really clear how we're talking about
games and how we value them but there is

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:16.890
games and how we value them but there is
 

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:20.240
games and how we value them but there is
a larger cultural discourse that I think

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:20.250
a larger cultural discourse that I think
 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:22.039
a larger cultural discourse that I think
is quite limited around this issue of

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:22.049
is quite limited around this issue of
 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:23.720
is quite limited around this issue of
what's the value of games and what's the

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:23.730
what's the value of games and what's the
 

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:26.540
what's the value of games and what's the
value of play and video games in

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:26.550
value of play and video games in
 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:28.460

I think historically in the media as
either games that are about violence or

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:36.030
either games that are about violence or
 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:39.950
either games that are about violence or
games that are about wasting time those

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:39.960
games that are about wasting time those
 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:41.780
games that are about wasting time those
are the two kind of dominant narratives

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:41.790
are the two kind of dominant narratives
 

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:43.610
are the two kind of dominant narratives
that people that don't know much about

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:43.620
that people that don't know much about
 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:45.950
that people that don't know much about
games here again and again and again and

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:45.960
games here again and again and again and
 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:50.270
games here again and again and again and
so it's a bit of a default position that

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:50.280
so it's a bit of a default position that
 

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:51.680
so it's a bit of a default position that
people fall into just because they

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:51.690
people fall into just because they
 

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:53.740
people fall into just because they
haven't perhaps really thought about it

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:53.750
haven't perhaps really thought about it
 

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:58.250
haven't perhaps really thought about it
any parent that that we have that has a

any parent that that we have that has a
 

00:04:58.260 --> 00:04:59.810
any parent that that we have that has a

gaming at home actually understands

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:02.760
gaming at home actually understands
 

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:05.330
gaming at home actually understands
something about why that child is gaming

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:05.340
something about why that child is gaming
 

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:06.680
something about why that child is gaming
and what they're getting out of it and

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:06.690
and what they're getting out of it and
 

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:08.120
and what they're getting out of it and
partially it is because they talk to the

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:08.130
partially it is because they talk to the
 

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:10.760
partially it is because they talk to the
kids and those reasons really vary

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:10.770
kids and those reasons really vary
 

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:13.180
kids and those reasons really vary
sometimes the the value of the gaming is

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:13.190
sometimes the the value of the gaming is
 

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:16.730
sometimes the the value of the gaming is
around the the social structure in the

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:16.740
around the the social structure in the
 

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:18.920
around the the social structure in the
community that the kids have we find

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:18.930
community that the kids have we find
 

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:20.960
community that the kids have we find
that that gaming is less about the

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:20.970
that that gaming is less about the
 

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:22.610
that that gaming is less about the
artifact of the game itself and more

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:22.620
artifact of the game itself and more
 

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:24.560
artifact of the game itself and more
about the community that sort of sits

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:24.570
about the community that sort of sits
 

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:26.000
about the community that sort of sits
around that game and that players are

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:26.010
around that game and that players are
 

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:28.550
around that game and that players are
part of and for many parents that social

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:28.560
part of and for many parents that social
 

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:31.940

creativity that they see happening in

these games they also see their kids

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:39.240
these games they also see their kids
 

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:41.600
these games they also see their kids
persisting on problems and games that

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:41.610
persisting on problems and games that
 

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:42.920
persisting on problems and games that
they don't see them persisting on in

they don't see them persisting on in

they don't see them persisting on in
other spaces and they begin to recognize

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:44.340
other spaces and they begin to recognize
 

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:47.500
other spaces and they begin to recognize
that that persistence and tenacity is

that that persistence and tenacity is
 

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:50.060
that that persistence and tenacity is
actually something pretty important they

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:50.070
actually something pretty important they
 

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:52.100
actually something pretty important they
don't really know how to make it happen

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:52.110
don't really know how to make it happen
 

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:54.110
don't really know how to make it happen
in other kinds of spaces but they they

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:54.120
in other kinds of spaces but they they
 

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:55.969
in other kinds of spaces but they they
see their kids doing that and they think

00:05:55.969 --> 00:05:55.979
see their kids doing that and they think
 

00:05:55.979 --> 00:05:58.580
see their kids doing that and they think
wow if i can get my kid to do that when

00:05:58.580 --> 00:05:58.590
wow if i can get my kid to do that when
 

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:00.500
wow if i can get my kid to do that when

they're working on math be that
persistent there's something really

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:01.860
persistent there's something really
 

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:05.840
persistent there's something really
valuable there so I think it's more this

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:05.850
valuable there so I think it's more this

issues that are maybe too complicated to
deal with outside a kind of play space

deal with outside a kind of play space
 

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:45.309
deal with outside a kind of play space
and so the notion and value of play

00:06:45.309 --> 00:06:45.319
and so the notion and value of play
 

00:06:45.319 --> 00:06:47.529
and so the notion and value of play
