00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:05.060
A coward dies, a thousand deaths, a soldier dies but one, one, one

40 kitchen picture and pitiful club. N****s, cop and police buffing. Greetings.

4
00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.730
I position myself to clock. Geez my enemy. Scattered suicidal situations.

5
00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:25.320
Never witnessed the Wiki shit that they was facing.

6
00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.940
Fuck it's is back with precedent. Pursue your bridges.

7
00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:30.590
He paid him to play a trick. White and switches,

8
00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.130
which is just bad mouth cause Wallen motherfuckers is blow good shots.

9
00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:39.560
The game should be so the secret sarcastic society. Somebody. Satan trauma.

10
00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:42.410
So even Mama couldn't raise me keeping the preaching.

11
00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:46.390
All my teachers couldn't reach me. The streets are buffing weed with my pizza.

12
00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.240

16
00:01:08.001 --> 00:01:10.850
for the red carpet. I'm here with the a the crime fighter comic.

17
00:01:10.851 --> 00:01:13.510
Sam Tripoli from the naughty show podcast that

18
00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:17.310
he wasn't given that, what are you thinking is Sam?

19
00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:20.900
He was about to take off America's most wanted. I found everybody.

20
00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:23.720
They're all right here today and uh, it's pretty awesome.

All of these people, all of hey, that great. 21st I here.

24
00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:38.750
Glad it's here tonight. We had been planning on this for like eight,

25
00:01:38.751 --> 00:01:41.000
nine months now. So it's our first event.

26
00:01:41.001 --> 00:01:43.130
We're really obviously excited about this.

27
00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:47.150
You had to wait to all of the people got out of jail first. Yeah,

28
00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:48.950
we made a couple of calls and said, come on,

29
00:01:48.951 --> 00:01:51.400
let him out a little early today please. Anything of Savannah.

30
00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:53.760
I need 16,000 pardons by 20.

31
00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.500
You look at on court cases decide fights. Is that how you said? Yeah,

32
00:01:57.501 --> 00:01:59.510
we looked at the dockets and we said, know these guys,

33
00:01:59.511 --> 00:02:02.750
let them off a little early today please. So that's what happens. So it's great.

34
00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.190
Great of leniency. Awesome event.

35
00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:10.800
You don't have pro ball cause they're all great, you know,

36
00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:12.750
and it's the story of redemption. It's really that, you know,

37
00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:15.650
it's a good message that we're doing here. So proud to be part of it.

38
00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:19.700
We're here getting at Kate's versus cons. Uh, everybody's high here.

39
00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:25.900
Everybody is just placed through so much weed smoke in there.

40
00:02:26.991 --> 00:02:30.650
I guarantee you every fighter flunks a drug tests have to deflect.

41
00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.350
You're going to be fighting high off the balls.

42
00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:39.650
Charles Barkley calls it the bt plate t a white people.

43
00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:45.490
We've got Matt Burch from Operation Repo on a B o t version of the white

44
00:02:46.821 --> 00:02:51.020
channel. True TV and we're with a business system.

45
00:02:51.021 --> 00:02:55.370
Freud, Costar. Well he's a little mixed

46
00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:01.340
squint rockers to sit in your seat, put from a ground. Baba Louie,

47
00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:06.240
who's my Baba Lewis version. He's rough

48
00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:12.610
English version of your head. Will you guys room for cops and cons?

49
00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:16.690
I'm a fine line on there.

50
00:03:16.691 --> 00:03:19.570
I'm kind of shading something to go more towards the cons, but you know,

51
00:03:19.571 --> 00:03:22.630
the police are, I might do. Okay. Well the cons are you're,

52
00:03:22.631 --> 00:03:24.840
the cons are your customers, right?

53
00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:29.830
I had definitely stepped out the police order. You can't get the cons.

54
00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:33.000
Some of the women that I'm only going to be politically correct. Right.

55
00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:37.390
We're here with Shane crutching on the cop side. He's a military.

56
00:03:37.391 --> 00:03:39.810
He's going to be fighting that I chain. Uh, what, uh,

57
00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.860
what brought you down here? How did you, how'd you get into this? First off, uh,

58
00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.990
back in 2006, you know, I got into it after the military and uh, here I am,

59
00:03:46.991 --> 00:03:50.560
you know, I, I just answered an open audition on the Internet and here I am.

60
00:03:50.561 --> 00:03:52.620
Out of 600 people, I'm on a 20 fighting.

61
00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:58.230
Which con do you think is harder to fight a pothead or crack head?

62
00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:02.530
Uh, I would a crack head. Yeah, definitely a crack head. You know,

63
00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:05.290
I don't mind everybody's smoking pot right now in here.

64
00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:07.620
I actually love it because that way, you know,

65
00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:09.850
I don't have to worry about being shot walking out, you know what I mean?

66
00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:14.140
Are you worried about flunking your drug tests? I already took it. I passed.

67
00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:17.770
Really? I don't do after. No, no, that's great.

68
00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:22.000
I would load up right now then if you knew a little extra supplement to go,

69
00:04:22.001 --> 00:04:24.000
go get it in right before you walked through the red carpet

70
00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:30.640
and drug dealers. No, you're good. Hey,

71
00:04:30.641 --> 00:04:33.130
thanks for joining us. Good luck tonight. And you know what?

72
00:04:33.131 --> 00:04:35.680
Take down my friend. Take that. Absolutely. Thank you.

73
00:04:35.681 --> 00:04:37.110
So semper Fi and God blessed.

74
00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:42.750
We're here at cage versus cons on the red carpet and a, I heard your name Sarah.

75
00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:43.683
And what's your name?

76
00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:48.460
What are you ladies here to either promote or you just here to support

77
00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:58.540
you find sexier cause that's a lot of chick fetishes right there.

78
00:04:58.541 --> 00:05:01.390
There's bad boys, dudes in uniforms.

79
00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:12.370
How about to be a cop? A still has this uniform.

80
00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:17.950
We're here with John Lick D. John, are you a one of the referees for tonight?

81
00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:22.450
And I'm a time keeping them. The lowest paid guy here. The lowest paid guy here.

82
00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:25.960
That's a man right there. He's rally lane.

83
00:05:25.961 --> 00:05:29.620
You know what his fucking pain rate is? That's hilarious. Hey,

84
00:05:29.621 --> 00:05:33.340
we're here with the cage mates. Otherwise known as the ring girls.

85
00:05:33.341 --> 00:05:37.330
They'll be showing off the, uh, the big ring signs on the way a,

86
00:05:37.331 --> 00:05:42.220
into new new, uh, round. So we're here with Kaleena, Danielle,

87
00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:46.540
Afton and Gabriela. So a real quick girls.

88
00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:49.600
Who are you for the cops or the cons?

89
00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:01.690
Well, the festivities happy gone outside of the ring as a,

90
00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:04.700
they've already broken up a fight here. The yellow coats are out.

91
00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:10.090
This might be the only MMA match where there's a better chance of dying outside

92
00:06:12.381 --> 00:06:14.300
of the octagon than there is inside

93
00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:21.370
<v 2>[inaudible]. So, uh, the arena is filling up as we speak.</v>

94
00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:22.990
Some of the pointers are

95
00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:27.400
making their way to stay around warm up rituals.

96
00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:35.710
[inaudible] here right now it's like they don't even have a call.

97
00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:41.620
[inaudible] fogger miss way too. So much smell of Philly blood.

98
00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:45.820
There's one walking right by us right there. So, uh,

99
00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:51.750
no festivities will sue begin the worse con here at the La sports arena.

100
00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:56.800
The beautiful ladies carrying the poster

101
00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:05.233
[inaudible] octagon

102
00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:11.870
<v 1>coming up with anticipation of who will win this white top or con.</v>

103
00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:24.020
<v 2>[inaudible] please.</v>

104
00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:36.733

105
00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:39.800
<v 1>all right. Fighting fans. Here we are.</v>

106
00:07:40.010 --> 00:07:43.580
We have ringside seats for this NMA bow.

107
00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:46.280
And the cage match and he's now we've got a man down already

108
00:07:58.020 --> 00:08:01.500
and your face Belper. Here it is right here in your face.

109
00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:04.680
All you Monday morning podcast listeners

110
00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:11.790
that love a good beat down. We have it for you here. Ringside. Oh no,

111
00:08:12.180 --> 00:08:13.500
he's got em in the cradle.

112
00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:17.290
It looks like he's ready to pin him on his back.

113
00:08:22.150 --> 00:08:23.330
We have an interlock

114
00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:30.050
because now it's just force on force.

115
00:08:31.070 --> 00:08:33.260
It's like wind versus water right here.

116
00:08:41.390 --> 00:08:42.223
<v 2>Okay.</v>

117
00:08:58.450 --> 00:09:03.320
[inaudible] [inaudible] charts to be stopped due to strangers.

118
00:09:09.130 --> 00:09:13.290
[inaudible] you see it, Dave?

119
00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:19.020
He wins by strikes. The referee stopped that fight in three months,

120
00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:22.250
minutes in Jesus Christ.

121
00:09:23.780 --> 00:09:28.420
Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ got him a SSW.

122
00:09:28.430 --> 00:09:30.180
I'm sure Jesus Christ. Inspiration.

123
00:09:30.230 --> 00:09:32.580
I get him into a Afrikaans and beat the shit out of people

124
00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:46.490
to kids.

125
00:09:53.470 --> 00:09:56.020
Well, here comes your cop into the arena.

126
00:09:57.210 --> 00:09:59.320
It's going to show a little video of him up there first.

127
00:10:11.870 --> 00:10:15.940
This guy is criminal id. Every age group. This is off.

128
00:10:16.490 --> 00:10:20.750
This kid came out, his baby in his mother's womb as

129
00:10:23.430 --> 00:10:24.263
Brooke Crook.

130
00:10:32.910 --> 00:10:33.743
William

131
00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:43.420
the ring girls. Oh, there's our,

132
00:10:44.020 --> 00:10:48.850
I think there's our friend Ashton that we met on the red carpet.

133
00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:54.720
Hooter girls. Probably the better a that's,

134
00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:57.410
I'd like to get locked in an octagon with [inaudible] does the hooter girls,

135
00:10:57.411 --> 00:10:59.300
I don't think I'd want to get locked in the octagon

136
00:11:04.810 --> 00:11:08.900
black suit over here with the red tennis guy. He's portraying the devil.

137
00:11:09.340 --> 00:11:13.070
Apparently. She looks like Dr d. Looks like Dan Akroyd from factor Detroit.

138
00:11:13.071 --> 00:11:16.880
Remember that cop verse con cops in the Blue Trunks.

139
00:11:18.590 --> 00:11:22.310
Yeah. Killer cop in the blue trunks. Khan in the black trunks

140
00:11:25.070 --> 00:11:29.970
places. Everyone that ref has pointed, we're ready to fight. Ooh.

141
00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:33.190
Con McWilliams comes out, look at the pop.

142
00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:37.110
I'm a body slam and he's got him down now submission.

143
00:11:38.310 --> 00:11:43.310
It's cop on top of con right now they're starting to uh,

144
00:11:44.820 --> 00:11:46.260
get in, are locked on the mat there.

145
00:11:49.230 --> 00:11:52.860
That does not look fun. Fun to watch.

146
00:11:52.861 --> 00:11:54.950
Not to be a part of there.

147
00:11:56.890 --> 00:12:01.010
<v 1>Hey, we're here with guy, Danny, Trey Ho, t a star,</v>

I tell you what, the only thing I would,

152
00:12:22.630 --> 00:12:24.460
I think the only people I'd mess around with in that ring,

153
00:12:24.510 --> 00:12:29.090
the Hooters girls when they're bringing out the ring cards going down.

154
00:12:29.470 --> 00:12:30.760
Absolutely. Would you ever do this?

155

Would you ever get yourself in a mixed up in this whole thing?

156
00:12:36.190 --> 00:12:39.370
Absolutely. I don't think your agent, your agent,

157

probably a next bike's going to be daddy and the hooter girl.

164
