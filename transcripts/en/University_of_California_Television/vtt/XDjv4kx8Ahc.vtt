00:00:00.553 --> 00:00:03.636
(electronic beeping)

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:11.570
- The Office of
Developmental Primary Care,

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:14.713
and the Department of Family
and Community Medicine at UCSF.

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:18.348
She provides primary care to adults

00:00:18.348 --> 00:00:23.347
with medical fragility and
complex behavioral problems.

00:00:23.347 --> 00:00:26.980
She has been working within this field

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:29.410
at least for the past 10 years.

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:31.270
And today is gonna talk to us

00:00:32.453 --> 00:00:34.720
about a different kind of a topic,

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:39.720
which is if I can find the title here...

00:00:41.592 --> 00:00:46.080
(laughs) Working with sensory
movement disorders and autism.

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:48.143
Dr. Kripke.
- Thank you so much Sherry.

00:00:49.073 --> 00:00:50.763
(audience applauds)
Hi.

00:00:53.953 --> 00:00:55.463
I have nothing to disclose.

00:00:57.335 --> 00:01:01.544
So the reason why I
wanted to give this talk

00:01:01.544 --> 00:01:03.618
is because I have come to understand

00:01:03.618 --> 00:01:06.780
that a lot of what we know for sure

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.093
about autism just isn't true.

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:13.750
We've developed services
for autistic people

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:16.826
which are based on the belief that autism

00:01:16.826 --> 00:01:21.356
is primarily a psychological problem

00:01:21.356 --> 00:01:25.230
characterized by deficits
in social understanding

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:27.820
and restricted behaviors and interests.

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:29.910
But I've come to believe that autism

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:32.450
is better accommodated when it's

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:34.923
understood as a neurological condition.

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.340
Increasingly, people working
in a neurological paradigm

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.710
are achieving remarkably good outcomes,

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:46.675
especially for those who don't speak

00:01:46.675 --> 00:01:49.030
or those whose speech is unreliable

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:53.300
and for those who have
prominent symptoms of dyspraxia.

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:57.070
Dyspraxia is difficulty
coordinating movement.

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:59.452
So what I wanna talk about today

00:01:59.452 --> 00:02:03.783
is to lead you through this thinking,

00:02:03.783 --> 00:02:06.423
starting with is autism a thing?

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:10.950
And going to what we know about sensory

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.480
and movement differences in autism.

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.035
What are the implications of that?

00:02:15.035 --> 00:02:17.780
Is autism better accommodated when

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:20.600
it's understood as a
neurological difference?

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:24.803
What are self-advocates telling
us and why should we listen?

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:30.990
10 years ago, we definitely
thought autism was a thing.

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:33.220
And everybody was looking for the gene,

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.730
we were looking for the
vaccine that was causing it.

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.803
It's a crisis, it's taking over the world.

00:02:37.803 --> 00:02:41.890
I think we've largely moved
through that thankfully,

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:45.543
although echoes of it sometimes
rear their ugly heads.

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:50.090
But a diagnosis of
autism doesn't correlate

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:53.460
with any specific trait or characteristic.

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:55.679
People can be super smart or have

00:02:55.679 --> 00:02:58.870
significant cognitive challenges.

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:00.930
They can be organized or have

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:04.810
very difficult executive
function problems.

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.690
They can be, I know autistic people

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:11.450
who are competitive surfers
and others who use wheelchairs.

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:13.799
They may or may not have seizures.

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:18.799
They may have normal or very
acute or scrambled senses.

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:23.350
They might be even deaf or blind.

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:25.580
They might be quite regulated to a fault,

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:27.630
or they may have very significant

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:31.430
anxiety and behavior problems
and mental health problems.

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:34.120
So basically we're
talking about a condition

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:39.120
that describes the full range
of human traits and behaviors.

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:42.737
It's not a very specific
clinical diagnosis,

00:03:42.737 --> 00:03:44.854
if it makes sense at all.

00:03:44.854 --> 00:03:49.854
So how did we get here to defining

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:53.447
this thing called autism, it
was defined by psychiatrists

00:03:53.447 --> 00:03:57.930
who were rooted in 20th
century cultural ideas

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:01.783
about intelligence,
eugenics, and social hygiene.

00:04:03.475 --> 00:04:08.140
Early work in treatments was
based on Skinner's framework.

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:10.882
Skinner believed that observable behavior

00:04:10.882 --> 00:04:13.726
is the only relevant target of treatment

00:04:13.726 --> 00:04:17.209
and that controlled experimental designs

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:21.520
are the only way to
evaluate its effectiveness.

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:26.520
In Skinner's paradigm, we
know that a treatment works

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:30.130
if you present a stimulus and the person

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:33.047
consistently responds
in the way you expect.

00:04:33.047 --> 00:04:37.070
For Skinner, thoughts, feelings,

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:41.410
emotions, any other non-observable

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:45.989
or less measurable aspect of
cognition is just not relevant.

00:04:45.989 --> 00:04:48.710
Skinner thought that we don't have

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:52.520
to ask questions about why
people behave the way they do

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:56.550
beyond a simplistic analysis of A-B-C,

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:59.713
the stimulus, the behavior,
and the consequence.

00:05:01.354 --> 00:05:04.762
Medical causes of behavior
changes aren't assessed.

00:05:04.762 --> 00:05:09.762
But of course, we know
that autistic people,

00:05:10.106 --> 00:05:14.990
what autistic people think and
feel is critically important.

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:19.388
Their past experiences and
traumas are completely relevant.

00:05:19.388 --> 00:05:21.761
Their health status is crucial.

00:05:21.761 --> 00:05:24.840
Understanding the reasons why they do

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:28.353
what they do is core to
developing good support.

00:05:29.406 --> 00:05:34.330
Autism is defined in the
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:37.340
of the American Psychiatric Associations,

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:40.440
but even the APA itself has begun

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:44.745
to question the validity of
the DSM classification scheme

00:05:44.745 --> 00:05:48.371
because it's based on a
professional consensus

00:05:48.371 --> 00:05:50.794
about clusters of psychological

00:05:50.794 --> 00:05:53.230
and behavioral symptoms rather

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:56.490
than on more objective biological data.

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:59.098
And the fields of psychiatry and neurology

00:05:59.098 --> 00:06:01.324
are growing closer together every day

00:06:01.324 --> 00:06:04.205
as our understanding of the basic science

00:06:04.205 --> 00:06:07.513
of both fields continues to improve.

00:06:08.937 --> 00:06:12.771
It's pretty clear that
there isn't one autism.

00:06:12.771 --> 00:06:15.930
Nor is it a single condition with a range

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:19.169
of presentations that
go from mild to severe.

00:06:19.169 --> 00:06:22.776
Autism is a catch-all diagnosis

00:06:22.776 --> 00:06:25.178
that includes a really wide range

00:06:25.178 --> 00:06:29.100
of ideologies, traits, characteristics,

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:31.539
strengths, challenges, genes,

00:06:31.539 --> 00:06:34.783
environment influences and biology.

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:42.410
Autistic people have a wide range

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:44.500
of strengths and challenges.

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:47.975
People with significant support
needs also have great gifts.

00:06:47.975 --> 00:06:52.230
Different parts of the brain
perform different functions.

00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:54.871
We know this, for example
there is different spots

00:06:54.871 --> 00:06:57.875
for speech, language, and reading.

00:06:57.875 --> 00:07:00.311
They have connections between them.

00:07:00.311 --> 00:07:05.311
But the connections can
be too weak or too strong.

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:07.824
For example, someone who speaks

00:07:07.824 --> 00:07:10.925
might have difficulty reading.

00:07:10.925 --> 00:07:15.925
Someone who signs English
may not be able to speak.

00:07:16.033 --> 00:07:19.061
Someone who reads and who has language

00:07:19.061 --> 00:07:21.150
may still have trouble speaking

00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:23.028
even though they can write.

00:07:23.028 --> 00:07:26.400
Applied behavior analysis,
the most common treatment

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:28.469
for autism, assumes that what you see

00:07:28.469 --> 00:07:31.250
is a good representation of what's going

00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:33.913
on in the brain, but it isn't.

00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:36.925
Many autistic people have a lot more

00:07:36.925 --> 00:07:39.743
going on inside than they can show.

00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:45.873
The brain is also connected to the body.

00:07:49.202 --> 00:07:52.490
The peripheral nervous system
is made up of the afferent

00:07:52.490 --> 00:07:56.073
motor system and the
efferent sensory system.

00:07:56.950 --> 00:08:01.020
The efferent carries
signals from the brain

00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:02.710
to the muscles so that we can move

00:08:02.710 --> 00:08:04.574
and do things we wanna do.

00:08:04.574 --> 00:08:06.468
The afferent system carries

00:08:06.468 --> 00:08:10.406
sensory information to the brain.

00:08:10.406 --> 00:08:13.715
Sometimes those messages get scrambled.

00:08:13.715 --> 00:08:16.255
This leads to action problems that can

00:08:16.255 --> 00:08:19.700
look a lot like autistic behavior.

00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:24.700
I used to teach that all
behavior is communication,

00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:27.530
and I'm here today to tell you

00:08:27.530 --> 00:08:30.223
to admit, to confess, I was wrong.

00:08:31.830 --> 00:08:33.850
Not all behavior is communication.

00:08:33.850 --> 00:08:36.482
Some of it is not purposeful at all.

00:08:36.482 --> 00:08:39.057
It's an artifact of difficulty organizing

00:08:39.057 --> 00:08:42.788
and regulating the sensory
and movement system

00:08:42.788 --> 00:08:45.453
even if it appears intentional.

00:08:46.930 --> 00:08:50.160
We all have experience with this.

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:54.310
For example, how many of you have ever

00:08:54.310 --> 00:08:58.980
changed your password and then
typed in the old password?

00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:02.570
Your fingers just automatically
do it, it's motor memory.

00:09:02.570 --> 00:09:05.370
You don't have a cognitive
problem, we've all done that.

00:09:06.266 --> 00:09:10.390
How many have you have
ever gotten startled

00:09:10.390 --> 00:09:12.856
and (blows air sharply) bopped someone

00:09:12.856 --> 00:09:14.840
before you could process
that they aren't a threat?

00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:17.028
Your limbic system just
went boom, fight or flight,

00:09:17.028 --> 00:09:20.896
and your cortical brain
that understood the context

00:09:20.896 --> 00:09:24.909
and inhibited that didn't
kick in fast enough.

00:09:24.909 --> 00:09:27.633
You're not aggressive people.

00:09:29.650 --> 00:09:33.162
Have you ever walked into
a crowded convention hall

00:09:33.162 --> 00:09:36.450
where there were hundreds of conversations

00:09:36.450 --> 00:09:38.336
and you were just hit
by this wall of sound

00:09:38.336 --> 00:09:42.662
and you couldn't distinguish
any conversation?

00:09:42.662 --> 00:09:46.900
You don't have, I would say you
don't have a hearing problem

00:09:46.900 --> 00:09:48.090
but I don't know whether you do or not.

00:09:48.090 --> 00:09:50.555
But that's not a manifestation
of a hearing problem.

00:09:50.555 --> 00:09:54.596
Maybe when you went to
that convention hall,

00:09:54.596 --> 00:09:57.630
you saw someone you
know and then suddenly,

00:09:57.630 --> 00:09:59.347
you could pick out just their voice

00:09:59.347 --> 00:10:01.980
when you couldn't distinguish
it before you saw them,

00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:03.994
before you got that sensory
information of seeing them

00:10:03.994 --> 00:10:08.073
and cooked up the visual
with the auditory.

00:10:10.184 --> 00:10:13.670
Have you ever tried to learn a new dance

00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:15.130
and the instructor's next to you

00:10:15.130 --> 00:10:17.350
and you're rockin' out and
you're doing a really good job

00:10:17.350 --> 00:10:19.520
and then another student is next to you

00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:20.780
and they're flubbin' up the steps

00:10:20.780 --> 00:10:22.850
and they've got the rhythm all wrong

00:10:22.850 --> 00:10:25.650
and you can't do it anymore, yeah.

00:10:25.650 --> 00:10:27.790
You weren't faking your difficulty.

00:10:27.790 --> 00:10:30.910
You weren't someone who had
mastered that motor plan

00:10:30.910 --> 00:10:35.910
and now in this new
environment unable to do it.

00:10:38.510 --> 00:10:41.710
That's, we're taking
in sensory information

00:10:41.710 --> 00:10:43.590
and that affects what we can do

00:10:43.590 --> 00:10:45.263
in terms of our motor control.

00:10:46.546 --> 00:10:51.546
Have you ever done a, let's
say a fine motor task,

00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:55.880
then you get into a rhythm
and you're really fast

00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:57.470
and accurate with it and then someone

00:10:57.470 --> 00:10:59.930
interrupts you and you mess it up?

00:10:59.930 --> 00:11:01.283
Yeah, I've done that too.

00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:08.470
Have you ever gotten nervous and your body

00:11:08.470 --> 00:11:10.653
froze or you were unable to speak?

00:11:13.090 --> 00:11:15.010
Have you ever been in a classroom

00:11:15.010 --> 00:11:16.530
where you could hear the professor

00:11:16.530 --> 00:11:18.740
but you weren't turned
into what he was saying

00:11:18.740 --> 00:11:20.170
until the professor said your name

00:11:20.170 --> 00:11:22.530
and then suddenly you
shifted your attention

00:11:22.530 --> 00:11:25.963
and could, were tuned into
what the professor was saying.

00:11:28.130 --> 00:11:32.680
Autistic people who have
verbal and motor apraxia

00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:36.470
describe bodies that
don't obey their minds.

00:11:36.470 --> 00:11:38.790
Where these types of sensory

00:11:38.790 --> 00:11:41.580
and movement integration glitches

00:11:41.580 --> 00:11:43.540
happen frequently throughout the day

00:11:43.540 --> 00:11:47.200
creating challenges with
navigating their world.

00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:50.480
Imagine how frustrating it would be

00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:53.940
if people assumed that these
sensory and movement glitches

00:11:53.940 --> 00:11:57.774
actually represented cognitive
or behavioral problems

00:11:57.774 --> 00:12:00.423
or a lack of social interests.

00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:06.400
She typed the wrong
password, therefore she must

00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:08.970
have terrible short-term memory.

00:12:08.970 --> 00:12:11.720
She bopped her friend so
she must have irritability

00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:13.720
and aggression, we need a pill for that.

00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:16.090
She doesn't approach groups,

00:12:16.090 --> 00:12:17.803
she must be in a world of her own.

00:12:19.050 --> 00:12:23.100
She's demonstrated she
can write her name before

00:12:23.100 --> 00:12:26.127
and she isn't doing it now, that must mean

00:12:26.127 --> 00:12:30.833
that she isn't cooperative or motivated.

00:12:32.330 --> 00:12:35.568
You can see how people would
come to these conclusions,

00:12:35.568 --> 00:12:38.820
but it's also to see the frustration

00:12:38.820 --> 00:12:40.773
and the despair that it could cause.

00:12:42.141 --> 00:12:46.880
I'll tell you a story from
our cart services consult team

00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:49.488
about how powerful it can be to understand

00:12:49.488 --> 00:12:52.780
autism as a neurological condition.

00:12:52.780 --> 00:12:55.500
We were consulted on a
client and the information

00:12:55.500 --> 00:12:58.850
we were given was that this was

00:12:58.850 --> 00:13:03.010
a client who was constantly violent.

00:13:03.010 --> 00:13:05.850
This client, they were the regional center

00:13:05.850 --> 00:13:09.670
was exploring out of state placement

00:13:09.670 --> 00:13:12.670
in an institution because
nothing was helping.

00:13:12.670 --> 00:13:15.410
They had consulted multiple behaviorists,

00:13:15.410 --> 00:13:18.590
and none of their top
level behavioral programs

00:13:18.590 --> 00:13:21.760
or top level behavioral homes were willing

00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:24.080
to serve this client anymore.

00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:26.500
And so when we went out there,

00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:30.180
we were prepared to meet
someone who was quite dangerous.

00:13:30.180 --> 00:13:33.683
But when we got there, we saw
what they were talking about.

00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:37.602
This person wasn't
aggressive or violent at all.

00:13:37.602 --> 00:13:42.530
He had more like a
repetitive movement, a tic.

00:13:42.530 --> 00:13:43.733
And it was like this.

00:13:44.945 --> 00:13:48.580
And it was very stereotyped,
it was always the same,

00:13:48.580 --> 00:13:51.380
always the same hand, it was unemotional.

00:13:51.380 --> 00:13:53.434
There was no emotion behind it.

00:13:53.434 --> 00:13:55.661
He wasn't going after
somebody, it was just boom.

00:13:55.661 --> 00:13:58.660
It was easily inhibited by his aides

00:13:58.660 --> 00:14:01.730
who would just touch his arm
and he would pull it back

00:14:01.730 --> 00:14:03.123
when they just touched his arm.

00:14:04.270 --> 00:14:07.920
It was more like a tic than an attack.

00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:11.620
And if you stood close to
him on that side of his body

00:14:11.620 --> 00:14:15.223
right in that line, he'd
get you and it would hurt.

00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:19.190
But we asked, has he caused any injuries?

00:14:19.190 --> 00:14:21.113
No, no injuries.

00:14:22.130 --> 00:14:24.777
Instead of fixating on this tic,

00:14:24.777 --> 00:14:29.350
the simple solution was
just you know it's coming.

00:14:29.350 --> 00:14:31.480
It's coming on this side,
if you stand right there,

00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:32.700
that's where you're gonna get it.

00:14:32.700 --> 00:14:35.680
Stand out of his reach, stand a step back.

00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:39.120
And ignore it, ignore it!

00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:42.210
There are other things
you could do with that,

00:14:42.210 --> 00:14:46.232
like you could scramble
or dilute or distract.

00:14:46.232 --> 00:14:49.000
You could gradually shape this movement

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.480
into something that was
less likely to get someone.

00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:54.240
Like we gradually make this
movement get a little lower

00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:56.500
so you're still doing it but
you're doing it down here

00:14:56.500 --> 00:14:58.250
where you're not gonna get someone.

00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:03.110
It also helped, another
recommendation we made

00:15:03.110 --> 00:15:07.313
was let's put him in a
less crowded environment.

00:15:08.660 --> 00:15:11.770
He did better in a home
that had fewer people

00:15:11.770 --> 00:15:15.217
and more space so it was
easier to dodge the movement.

00:15:15.217 --> 00:15:18.340
The main intervention, though,

00:15:18.340 --> 00:15:21.840
was just reinterpreting
what people were seeing.

00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:25.020
Just reinterpreting it
in neurological terms.

00:15:25.020 --> 00:15:27.529
It didn't cure him, it didn't change him.

00:15:27.529 --> 00:15:30.920
But that intervention was so effective

00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:33.023
that he found a new home.

00:15:34.582 --> 00:15:39.582
The program that he started
with this new paradigm

00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:44.110
was focused on activities
instead of his movement problem.

00:15:44.110 --> 00:15:46.820
And the last we heard, he was doing well.

00:15:46.820 --> 00:15:49.040
He wasn't needing one
on one support anymore

00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:51.850
and he was no longer at risk
of out of home placement

00:15:51.850 --> 00:15:55.713
or placement in an institution, powerful.

00:15:56.750 --> 00:15:58.750
An analogy to this would be

00:15:58.750 --> 00:16:01.432
Tourette's Syndrome or stuttering.

00:16:01.432 --> 00:16:04.210
When you have a person
with Tourette's Syndrome

00:16:04.210 --> 00:16:06.893
who's involuntarily making loud sounds,

00:16:07.789 --> 00:16:10.720
using swear words, or a
person who is stuttering

00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:12.560
who's getting stuck on a word,

00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:14.700
the best way that we can help them

00:16:14.700 --> 00:16:18.570
is to ignore it, is to just move on.

00:16:18.570 --> 00:16:21.230
By focusing on it, it
usually makes it worse

00:16:21.230 --> 00:16:23.540
and it makes it more disruptive to others.

00:16:23.540 --> 00:16:26.270
If we just ignore it and
say oops and move on,

00:16:26.270 --> 00:16:28.830
they're able to function better.

00:16:28.830 --> 00:16:30.270
And if we increase their anxiety

00:16:30.270 --> 00:16:32.580
by fixating on it then it actually

00:16:32.580 --> 00:16:34.540
makes them stutter more or makes

00:16:34.540 --> 00:16:36.373
the involuntary movement worse.

00:16:39.414 --> 00:16:44.414
Movement varies from more
purposeful to more automatic.

00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:51.470
Movements that start as purposeful

00:16:51.470 --> 00:16:54.310
can become automatic with practice.

00:16:54.310 --> 00:16:56.290
We've all done this, it's motor memory.

00:16:56.290 --> 00:16:58.499
You practice something
enough, you get better at it

00:16:58.499 --> 00:17:01.236
and it becomes something that
you have to think about less.

00:17:01.236 --> 00:17:04.838
Reflexive movements can
also become automatic

00:17:04.838 --> 00:17:06.920
and that's probably how that started.

00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:09.820
There was probably somebody
that this person wanted to bop

00:17:10.730 --> 00:17:12.760
at one point but then it just became

00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:15.060
a repetitive movement
that they couldn't stop.

00:17:15.950 --> 00:17:19.834
Sometimes automatic
movements can be helpful.

00:17:19.834 --> 00:17:22.790
But sometimes they aren't, for example,

00:17:22.790 --> 00:17:26.100
it helps to practice actions like walking

00:17:26.100 --> 00:17:28.770
and talking and do those automatically.

00:17:28.770 --> 00:17:31.986
But if it becomes an obsession,
it can be frustrating.

00:17:31.986 --> 00:17:35.260
For instance if I wanna put on my shoes

00:17:35.260 --> 00:17:36.800
in the morning it's really helpful

00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:39.470
to have the motions to put
on my shoes down really well,

00:17:39.470 --> 00:17:42.700
to tie them and to do
that pretty automatically.

00:17:42.700 --> 00:17:46.200
And it helps to have that
motor plan well practiced.

00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:48.840
But if I go to the beach, I don't want

00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:51.780
to see my shoes and have that trigger

00:17:51.780 --> 00:17:54.094
that motor plan so I put
them on automatically

00:17:54.094 --> 00:17:56.683
even though I'm not ready to go home.

00:17:59.490 --> 00:18:03.750
Our ability to control our
purposeful movement is a gift.

00:18:03.750 --> 00:18:06.230
And autistic people have other gifts,

00:18:06.230 --> 00:18:08.713
like persistence and clear thinking.

00:18:12.500 --> 00:18:14.760
Some movements happen unconsciously,

00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:17.540
like the muscle movements of digestion.

00:18:17.540 --> 00:18:20.880
There was a discussion
at the last intra-agency

00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:24.696
autism coordinating
committee workshop on health

00:18:24.696 --> 00:18:28.192
about whether the same
micro-movement issues

00:18:28.192 --> 00:18:31.010
that we're finding are
affecting skeletal muscles

00:18:31.010 --> 00:18:33.040
and our ability to control our muscles,

00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:36.737
maybe that those same issues, I'll go back

00:18:36.737 --> 00:18:40.500
to the slide that that, the brain is also

00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:43.970
controlling our autonomic motor system

00:18:43.970 --> 00:18:46.920
and the system that affects peristalsis.

00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:48.990
That's the movements that your bowel makes

00:18:48.990 --> 00:18:53.623
to make food go down the right
track towards the bottom.

00:18:54.490 --> 00:18:58.140
What if the same kind of
movement discoordination

00:18:58.140 --> 00:19:01.859
is also affecting those
automatic movements?

00:19:01.859 --> 00:19:04.940
Maybe some of that accounts
for the constipation

00:19:04.940 --> 00:19:06.973
that's so prevalent in autism?

00:19:14.820 --> 00:19:16.690
So what do we know about sensory

00:19:16.690 --> 00:19:19.350
and movement issues in autism?

00:19:19.350 --> 00:19:22.280
By assessing the traits
and characteristics

00:19:22.280 --> 00:19:25.380
of individuals, autism can be addressed

00:19:25.380 --> 00:19:28.003
without even being named,
you don't need a label.

00:19:28.930 --> 00:19:31.379
I think it's helpful to get away

00:19:31.379 --> 00:19:34.700
from those diagnostic
labels because they free us

00:19:34.700 --> 00:19:37.733
from our unconscious bias
about what autistic people are.

00:19:40.060 --> 00:19:44.180
Without preconceived notions,
we can better identify

00:19:44.180 --> 00:19:47.890
their individual
strengths and what we have

00:19:47.890 --> 00:19:49.760
to work with and the
challenges that we have

00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:51.670
to work around in order to provide

00:19:51.670 --> 00:19:55.700
education, communication, and opportunity.

00:19:55.700 --> 00:19:58.580
They're individuals, no
traits and characteristics

00:19:58.580 --> 00:20:01.023
in common, each one different.

00:20:02.740 --> 00:20:06.451
What learning channels are
open at any given time?

00:20:06.451 --> 00:20:09.453
Can we get their visual attention?

00:20:09.453 --> 00:20:13.780
Is their auditory pathway more open

00:20:13.780 --> 00:20:16.520
to me at this moment to teach them?

00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:19.191
What if I tried a tactile or a kinesthetic

00:20:19.191 --> 00:20:22.023
method to focus their attention?

00:20:24.940 --> 00:20:26.710
We have experience with this too.

00:20:26.710 --> 00:20:31.260
Some of you are very focused
on your visual attention,

00:20:31.260 --> 00:20:33.774
you're on your cell phone
and you're tuning me out.

00:20:33.774 --> 00:20:36.070
But maybe there's something I could do

00:20:36.070 --> 00:20:38.440
to get your attention
back to the auditory.

00:20:38.440 --> 00:20:41.750
Like what if I changed
the rate of my voice

00:20:41.750 --> 00:20:44.983
or I started to whisper or I
said something really loud?

00:20:47.591 --> 00:20:51.270
I could get you into your auditory pathway

00:20:51.270 --> 00:20:54.120
by doing something a little
bit different to shake it up.

00:20:58.710 --> 00:21:00.700
What we know, what do we know about

00:21:00.700 --> 00:21:02.570
sensory and movement issues, we know

00:21:02.570 --> 00:21:05.883
that first performance
doesn't equal intelligence.

00:21:09.521 --> 00:21:10.500
If an examiner asks a question,

00:21:10.500 --> 00:21:12.410
there's all sorts of reasons why

00:21:12.410 --> 00:21:16.620
somebody might not respond or
might not respond correctly.

00:21:16.620 --> 00:21:18.783
Maybe there were sensory distractions.

00:21:19.790 --> 00:21:22.170
Maybe the picture wasn't presented

00:21:22.170 --> 00:21:25.483
in the person's narrow field of vision.

00:21:27.230 --> 00:21:30.680
Maybe the question prompted
an automatic response

00:21:30.680 --> 00:21:33.370
rather than a purposeful
response in response.

00:21:33.370 --> 00:21:34.883
We see this with echolalia.

00:21:35.900 --> 00:21:38.790
Most intelligence testing has been normed

00:21:38.790 --> 00:21:41.570
on people who speak fluently and in people

00:21:41.570 --> 00:21:46.310
who have very well-regulated
sensory and movement skills.

00:21:46.310 --> 00:21:51.310
And how those norms
apply to people who don't

00:21:51.735 --> 00:21:56.610
is something that I think
we need to question.

00:21:56.610 --> 00:21:59.130
There's a growing body of research showing

00:21:59.130 --> 00:22:00.970
that intelligence testing in autism

00:22:00.970 --> 00:22:04.580
doesn't consistently
provide valid results.

00:22:04.580 --> 00:22:07.470
And it's causing us to
underestimate people.

00:22:07.470 --> 00:22:10.970
Think about what would happen for a second

00:22:10.970 --> 00:22:13.410
if we administered an intelligence test

00:22:13.410 --> 00:22:15.610
to Stephen Hawking but we took away

00:22:15.610 --> 00:22:19.580
his AAC device so he couldn't communicate?

00:22:19.580 --> 00:22:22.040
What if we just assumed that his inability

00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:25.423
to respond meant that
he didn't understand?

00:22:29.080 --> 00:22:30.580
Who else are we doing that to?

00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:36.637
Historically we've done this
to nonspeaking people before.

00:22:36.637 --> 00:22:38.950
We did this to the deaf community.

00:22:38.950 --> 00:22:41.250
We presumed that people who are deaf

00:22:41.250 --> 00:22:44.369
who had unclear speech had
intellectual disabilities.

00:22:44.369 --> 00:22:49.010
We did it to Helen Keller,
she had to overcome

00:22:49.010 --> 00:22:50.632
the resistance of skeptics in order

00:22:50.632 --> 00:22:52.950
to be admitted to Radcliffe College

00:22:52.950 --> 00:22:55.290
because people thought
her aides were giving her

00:22:55.290 --> 00:22:58.103
the answer or communicating
for her in some way.

00:22:59.100 --> 00:23:03.870
Intelligence, intelligence also is not

00:23:03.870 --> 00:23:07.070
a fixed trait or a fixed capacity.

00:23:07.070 --> 00:23:09.617
It isn't a prognosis, the full richness

00:23:09.617 --> 00:23:14.210
of a person's cognitive and communicative

00:23:14.210 --> 00:23:16.834
and sensory and movement function

00:23:16.834 --> 00:23:21.703
can't be encapsulated into
a two or three digit number.

00:23:24.170 --> 00:23:26.590
We need to presume competence,

00:23:26.590 --> 00:23:28.610
even in people who don't speak

00:23:28.610 --> 00:23:31.223
or whose speech is
unreliable communication.

00:23:32.786 --> 00:23:35.323
A lot of people push back and say,

00:23:35.323 --> 00:23:38.489
presume competence,
that's not a good thing

00:23:38.489 --> 00:23:43.489
because clearly not all people
are geniuses underneath.

00:23:45.290 --> 00:23:47.700
Maybe they can't communicate
but they're not all geniuses.

00:23:47.700 --> 00:23:50.120
And that's not what
presuming competence means.

00:23:50.120 --> 00:23:52.050
It doesn't mean that everybody

00:23:52.050 --> 00:23:55.140
has the same cognition behind

00:23:55.140 --> 00:23:57.070
those sensory and movement differences.

00:23:57.070 --> 00:23:59.080
They have the full range
just like they have

00:23:59.080 --> 00:24:01.743
the full range of other
traits and characteristics.

00:24:02.670 --> 00:24:05.740
And it also doesn't mean
that all autistic people

00:24:05.740 --> 00:24:08.762
have been exposed to
education or information.

00:24:08.762 --> 00:24:12.212
But what it does mean is that we presume

00:24:12.212 --> 00:24:14.437
that people can learn and grow

00:24:14.437 --> 00:24:17.163
even if they can't
demonstrate what they know.

00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:24.474
Presuming competence, it's
harder than it sounds to do.

00:24:24.474 --> 00:24:27.330
You have to take a leap of faith

00:24:27.330 --> 00:24:28.810
that you're making a difference

00:24:28.810 --> 00:24:31.080
even when it isn't apparent, at least

00:24:31.080 --> 00:24:32.763
at first, that you're succeeding.

00:24:34.710 --> 00:24:38.210
You haven't, if you haven't seen the film,

00:24:38.210 --> 00:24:40.963
has anybody here seen the
film Intelligent Lives?

00:24:42.980 --> 00:24:45.490
Not too many hands going up.

00:24:45.490 --> 00:24:50.490
It's a really great film,
it traces the history

00:24:51.060 --> 00:24:53.782
of intellectual disability
and that concept

00:24:53.782 --> 00:24:57.940
and it follows three people
with intellectual disabilities

00:24:57.940 --> 00:25:00.531
as they successfully pursue education

00:25:00.531 --> 00:25:03.288
and relationships and self-directed lives.

00:25:03.288 --> 00:25:07.191
And increasingly, people
with autism who don't speak

00:25:07.191 --> 00:25:10.091
and who've been labeled low-functioning

00:25:10.091 --> 00:25:13.472
or who have been brought up in moderate

00:25:13.472 --> 00:25:15.916
to severe Special Ed classrooms

00:25:15.916 --> 00:25:19.774
are gaining access to higher education,

00:25:19.774 --> 00:25:22.490
to forming families, to working,

00:25:22.490 --> 00:25:24.860
and to pursuing a full
range of opportunities.

00:25:24.860 --> 00:25:26.483
It's really exciting.

00:25:31.130 --> 00:25:32.623
What are the implications?

00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:36.665
What are the implications of these

00:25:36.665 --> 00:25:38.750
sensory and movement differences?

00:25:38.750 --> 00:25:42.180
Choosing therapeutic approaches needs

00:25:42.180 --> 00:25:45.110
to be individualized
based on an assessment

00:25:45.110 --> 00:25:47.180
that includes an understanding

00:25:47.180 --> 00:25:49.680
of their unique and individual

00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:51.713
sensory and movement differences.

00:25:52.680 --> 00:25:55.100
A corollary to that is that we need

00:25:55.100 --> 00:25:57.548
to use caution when applying evidence.

00:25:57.548 --> 00:26:00.113
Evidence-based practice is much more

00:26:00.113 --> 00:26:02.760
than just counting up the number

00:26:02.760 --> 00:26:04.930
of peer-reviewed articles that show

00:26:04.930 --> 00:26:07.200
a therapy works or it doesn't work.

00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:10.940
We need to talk, we'll talk
more about applying evidence

00:26:10.940 --> 00:26:13.930
in a minute and how to go about that.

00:26:13.930 --> 00:26:18.930
Working with sensory
and movement differences

00:26:19.610 --> 00:26:21.913
is more effective than
working against them.

00:26:23.404 --> 00:26:24.383
That sounds obvious, right?

00:26:25.361 --> 00:26:27.543
But it's infrequently practiced.

00:26:28.850 --> 00:26:33.850
And in fact, the structure
of the individual

00:26:34.010 --> 00:26:38.383
education plan system is a deficit model.

00:26:39.890 --> 00:26:42.400
We assess people, we make a list

00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:44.320
of every deficit they have, we come up

00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:47.790
with a plan to for how we're
gonna address each one.

00:26:47.790 --> 00:26:51.430
And then the dreaded
measurable objectives.

00:26:51.430 --> 00:26:54.260
We need to be able to
prove that what we're doing

00:26:55.268 --> 00:26:57.380
is making a difference and
in a pretty short timeframe

00:26:57.380 --> 00:27:02.060
within three months and if we can't,

00:27:02.060 --> 00:27:03.713
then we assume we've failed.

00:27:04.670 --> 00:27:08.000
Presuming competence at least at first,

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:09.683
requires a leap of faith.

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:14.955
It isn't a place, in our
current educational system,

00:27:14.955 --> 00:27:17.245
in our deficit framework for it,

00:27:17.245 --> 00:27:20.123
there isn't a place for that.

00:27:22.010 --> 00:27:23.420
There isn't a place for people

00:27:23.420 --> 00:27:27.680
who haven't learned the
skills yet to demonstrate

00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:30.623
everything they know and
to communicate fluently.

00:27:32.140 --> 00:27:34.308
That can lead to people
getting stuck with IEPs

00:27:34.308 --> 00:27:38.093
that are focused on weaknesses
instead of strengths

00:27:38.093 --> 00:27:41.320
and with goals that
make them do basic work

00:27:41.320 --> 00:27:43.893
over and over and over again.

00:27:46.140 --> 00:27:49.390
This burns out parents
and it burns out staff too

00:27:49.390 --> 00:27:52.783
who don't see progress despite
a lot of money and effort.

00:27:55.227 --> 00:28:00.227
Everybody needs a fluent form
of expressive communication.

00:28:02.010 --> 00:28:06.353
This needs to be an early and
top priority, don't give up.

00:28:07.410 --> 00:28:10.160
The Office of Developmental
Primary Care's guide,

00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:14.530
Everybody Communicates, is
available out there at our table.

00:28:14.530 --> 00:28:17.385
It's also available
online and it helps you

00:28:17.385 --> 00:28:20.065
figure out how to get an assessment

00:28:20.065 --> 00:28:23.250
that takes into account sensory, movement,

00:28:23.250 --> 00:28:27.707
and cognitive differences
and how to assess services.

00:28:27.707 --> 00:28:31.310
There's also information in your handout,

00:28:31.310 --> 00:28:33.500
the United for Communication Choices

00:28:33.500 --> 00:28:36.170
website has information.

00:28:36.170 --> 00:28:39.003
When exploring options for treatment,

00:28:39.003 --> 00:28:44.003
listen to autistic people,
read what they say.

00:28:44.710 --> 00:28:47.240
I've given you a small sampling

00:28:47.240 --> 00:28:50.393
of blogs in your handout, go explore them.

00:28:51.410 --> 00:28:53.520
Find people who have similar traits

00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:55.530
and characteristics to the individual

00:28:55.530 --> 00:28:59.130
you're trying to help and
see what worked for them.

00:28:59.130 --> 00:29:01.480
And see, those are probably gonna

00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:03.993
be the most fruitful approaches.

00:29:05.930 --> 00:29:07.850
Because of unconscious bias,

00:29:07.850 --> 00:29:10.580
people are routinely underestimated.

00:29:10.580 --> 00:29:13.060
So presume competence, be skeptical

00:29:13.060 --> 00:29:15.553
about IQ tests, don't
let a number determine

00:29:15.553 --> 00:29:18.543
your opportunities or your potential.

00:29:22.600 --> 00:29:24.870
So I promised you we would come back

00:29:24.870 --> 00:29:28.340
to applying evidence and I wanna talk

00:29:28.340 --> 00:29:30.466
about this 'cause it's important

00:29:30.466 --> 00:29:32.755
because I think a lot of the
professional organizations

00:29:32.755 --> 00:29:36.700
are moving towards what they
call evidence-based practice,

00:29:36.700 --> 00:29:38.678
and wow that sounds fabulous doesn't it?

00:29:38.678 --> 00:29:43.560
And I, as a physician,
was a medical editor.

00:29:43.560 --> 00:29:47.590
And I started in the
American Family Physician,

00:29:47.590 --> 00:29:50.620
the Cochran for Clinicians Department

00:29:50.620 --> 00:29:53.765
which is all about
evidence-based practice.

00:29:53.765 --> 00:29:57.132
I'm a strong supporter of
it, but I also recognize

00:29:57.132 --> 00:30:02.132
that only 10% of what
we do in medicine even,

00:30:03.610 --> 00:30:07.470
is based on good quality
randomized control trials

00:30:07.470 --> 00:30:09.253
or other high-quality evidence.

00:30:10.210 --> 00:30:15.210
Clinical trials can only
answer very narrow questions.

00:30:15.290 --> 00:30:17.980
I think it was Einstein who said,

00:30:17.980 --> 00:30:20.750
not everything that can
be studied is important

00:30:20.750 --> 00:30:23.053
and not everything
important can be studied.

00:30:25.292 --> 00:30:27.770
When we're talking about people

00:30:27.770 --> 00:30:30.867
with such unique and a wide range

00:30:30.867 --> 00:30:33.520
of traits and characteristics,

00:30:33.520 --> 00:30:36.485
it's hard to generalize
from the experience

00:30:36.485 --> 00:30:39.973
of one person or one group
of people to another.

00:30:39.973 --> 00:30:43.203
They can be very different.

00:30:44.405 --> 00:30:48.100
People have also found
highly idiosyncratic

00:30:48.100 --> 00:30:50.980
and highly effective
ways of communicating,

00:30:50.980 --> 00:30:53.413
of learning, and of navigating the world.

00:30:54.830 --> 00:30:59.623
If something is proven
useful for an individual,

00:31:02.080 --> 00:31:05.053
that's evidence-based for that individual.

00:31:06.090 --> 00:31:08.350
We don't have to look at that individual

00:31:08.350 --> 00:31:10.463
and say this thing that
you're finding so successful

00:31:10.463 --> 00:31:12.340
and that's improving your life

00:31:12.340 --> 00:31:15.047
and that we can see you participating

00:31:15.047 --> 00:31:17.510
in your home, in your
school, in your community,

00:31:17.510 --> 00:31:22.470
and accessing the general
curriculum must be fake

00:31:22.470 --> 00:31:24.340
because we don't have
a peer-reviewed article

00:31:24.340 --> 00:31:26.890
to prove that it's legitimate.

00:31:26.890 --> 00:31:29.687
No, it's legitimate for that person.

00:31:29.687 --> 00:31:33.373
For that person you can see
it's completely empiric.

00:31:37.184 --> 00:31:40.720
For an individual, the presence or absence

00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:42.900
of peer-reviewed literature is irrelevant

00:31:42.900 --> 00:31:44.940
if something is working for them.

00:31:44.940 --> 00:31:47.460
The peer-reviewed
literature is very relevant

00:31:47.460 --> 00:31:49.737
if you are a professional and trying

00:31:49.737 --> 00:31:52.059
to say okay, out of this
range of treatments,

00:31:52.059 --> 00:31:57.025
what is, what has the
best percentage chance

00:31:57.025 --> 00:31:59.300
of being effective in this person?

00:31:59.300 --> 00:32:01.200
Then it's important
but when you're talking

00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:03.182
about an individual who's
already using a technique,

00:32:03.182 --> 00:32:07.700
even an idiosyncratic
technique effectively,

00:32:07.700 --> 00:32:09.400
there's no reason to interrupt it.

00:32:10.820 --> 00:32:13.850
So when we're assessing whether

00:32:13.850 --> 00:32:17.350
to apply research to
a specific individual,

00:32:17.350 --> 00:32:21.640
here's what evidence-based
practice tells us to do.

00:32:21.640 --> 00:32:26.176
First, does this individual share the same

00:32:26.176 --> 00:32:28.790
traits and characteristics and conditions

00:32:28.790 --> 00:32:30.810
as the people in the study?

00:32:30.810 --> 00:32:35.810
So if we have an FMRI
study and it was done

00:32:36.750 --> 00:32:41.750
on people who can cooperate
with getting into an MRI,

00:32:41.845 --> 00:32:45.720
does it apply to an autistic person

00:32:45.720 --> 00:32:47.690
who that would be unimaginable?

00:32:47.690 --> 00:32:50.860
They wouldn't be able to sit there.

00:32:50.860 --> 00:32:51.943
It probably doesn't.

00:32:53.180 --> 00:32:58.180
Saying that this was a study
of autism isn't enough.

00:32:58.470 --> 00:33:00.570
We need to know whether the actual traits

00:33:00.570 --> 00:33:02.660
and characteristics of
the people in the study

00:33:02.660 --> 00:33:04.471
are similar to the person
we're trying to help.

00:33:04.471 --> 00:33:06.600
And sometimes the research just stops

00:33:06.600 --> 00:33:08.710
with well they have a diagnosis

00:33:08.710 --> 00:33:10.703
of autism and it was done with
these standardized methods

00:33:10.703 --> 00:33:15.703
and they don't really give
you a lot of information

00:33:15.924 --> 00:33:18.840
about the unique traits
and characteristics

00:33:18.840 --> 00:33:21.553
of the people they
enrolled in their study.

00:33:21.553 --> 00:33:23.040
It may be very hard to
know whether you can

00:33:23.040 --> 00:33:26.251
generalize that study to
your particular individual.

00:33:26.251 --> 00:33:31.251
Second, are the outcome measures
meaningful to your client?

00:33:34.320 --> 00:33:37.160
For example, a communication method

00:33:37.160 --> 00:33:40.240
that only allows you to request food items

00:33:40.240 --> 00:33:44.210
at snack at school is not very meaningful

00:33:44.210 --> 00:33:47.209
especially if your goal
is to get an education

00:33:47.209 --> 00:33:50.023
and to communicate your
authentic thoughts.

00:33:51.990 --> 00:33:56.360
Not all outcomes are equally meaningful

00:33:56.360 --> 00:33:58.070
to the person you're trying to help.

00:33:58.070 --> 00:34:01.306
Is the outcome that this intervention

00:34:01.306 --> 00:34:05.040
is purporting to help
something that my patient

00:34:05.040 --> 00:34:07.773
cares about, my individual
patient cares about?

00:34:09.980 --> 00:34:11.223
Are the methods valid?

00:34:13.400 --> 00:34:16.060
Some research methods are
more rigorous than others,

00:34:16.060 --> 00:34:18.880
but to be valid you have to determine

00:34:18.880 --> 00:34:22.420
if the test measures what
it's supposed to measure.

00:34:22.420 --> 00:34:26.790
For example, if you're trying to study

00:34:26.790 --> 00:34:28.910
the outcomes of an intervention

00:34:28.910 --> 00:34:31.782
on the ability of someone to communicate

00:34:31.782 --> 00:34:35.000
in their day-to-day life
in a natural setting

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:40.000
with receptive and supportive
communication partners,

00:34:42.713 --> 00:34:46.049
does a study that was done in an exam room

00:34:46.049 --> 00:34:51.049
with someone who was
trying to read a script

00:34:51.296 --> 00:34:56.296
and be very neutral and objective,

00:34:56.600 --> 00:34:57.853
does it measure that?

00:34:59.640 --> 00:35:02.860
What if the test of communication

00:35:02.860 --> 00:35:06.590
consisted of a bunch of vocabulary drills?

00:35:06.590 --> 00:35:09.140
Does that really measure your ability

00:35:09.140 --> 00:35:12.193
to communicate your authentic
thoughts, is it relevant?

00:35:13.340 --> 00:35:17.430
Maybe it's research, they reported

00:35:17.430 --> 00:35:20.020
their observations but it may not be valid

00:35:20.020 --> 00:35:22.160
in the sense that it's not measuring

00:35:22.160 --> 00:35:24.563
what you're hoping to measure.

00:35:25.900 --> 00:35:28.033
It's not valid in that construct way.

00:35:29.830 --> 00:35:32.570
Is the, another consideration,

00:35:32.570 --> 00:35:36.540
is the therapy available and
is there a way to implement it?

00:35:36.540 --> 00:35:41.410
And if there isn't then
as regional center staff

00:35:41.410 --> 00:35:44.370
and vendors we need to fix that problem.

00:35:44.370 --> 00:35:47.723
But in the meantime, in the meantime

00:35:47.723 --> 00:35:50.330
that's not helpful to your patient,

00:35:50.330 --> 00:35:52.283
at least not immediately.

00:35:53.637 --> 00:35:58.550
So unfortunately often the answer is

00:35:58.550 --> 00:36:03.130
that the therapies that are working best

00:36:03.130 --> 00:36:04.920
aren't available in public schools.

00:36:04.920 --> 00:36:06.740
And some of that is the structure

00:36:06.740 --> 00:36:11.580
of the IEP system and some of
it is logistical challenges

00:36:11.580 --> 00:36:14.020
with implementing some of the most

00:36:14.020 --> 00:36:16.420
effective methods in
public school settings.

00:36:16.420 --> 00:36:18.510
A lot of them are one to one, they're hard

00:36:18.510 --> 00:36:20.040
to implement in group settings.

00:36:20.040 --> 00:36:23.200
They require expertise
that's hard to develop

00:36:23.200 --> 00:36:26.735
when people, when staff
turnover is very great.

00:36:26.735 --> 00:36:28.990
So there are significant challenges

00:36:28.990 --> 00:36:31.317
to making therapies available to people

00:36:31.317 --> 00:36:33.190
and that needs to be taken into account

00:36:33.190 --> 00:36:34.540
when we decide what we offer

00:36:34.540 --> 00:36:36.140
to people and what we recommend.

00:36:38.100 --> 00:36:43.100
In addition to studying
whether a method works,

00:36:44.661 --> 00:36:47.710
we need to study what else it does.

00:36:47.710 --> 00:36:49.860
What are the risks,
what are the downsides?

00:36:53.346 --> 00:36:55.710
Just because it helps in one way

00:36:55.710 --> 00:37:00.710
doesn't mean that the
risk benefit balance is,

00:37:01.508 --> 00:37:05.283
is favorable on the whole.

00:37:07.440 --> 00:37:10.050
And finally is the treatment consistent

00:37:10.050 --> 00:37:15.050
with the patient's cultural values,

00:37:15.100 --> 00:37:17.880
with the disability community's

00:37:17.880 --> 00:37:20.683
values and their expectations?

00:37:21.540 --> 00:37:24.040
These are all things to
take into consideration

00:37:24.040 --> 00:37:25.950
and I wanna tell you another story

00:37:25.950 --> 00:37:28.430
from our consult practice to illustrate

00:37:28.430 --> 00:37:31.170
why it's so important to be careful

00:37:31.170 --> 00:37:33.123
about how we apply evidence.

00:37:34.060 --> 00:37:38.150
We were consulted on a
non-speaking autistic girl

00:37:38.150 --> 00:37:42.010
who was having very serious
self-injurious behavior

00:37:42.010 --> 00:37:45.990
and her school was at their wit's end

00:37:45.990 --> 00:37:48.510
and said they could no longer serve her.

00:37:48.510 --> 00:37:50.380
So we reviewed her records

00:37:50.380 --> 00:37:52.723
and we noted she's blind and deaf.

00:37:53.980 --> 00:37:56.620
Because her school was dedicated

00:37:56.620 --> 00:37:59.330
to evidence-based practice for autism,

00:37:59.330 --> 00:38:03.402
they were implementing PECS,
those are picture icons,

00:38:03.402 --> 00:38:07.540
to support her communication.
(audience laughs)

00:38:07.540 --> 00:38:11.689
Yeah, that's the mainstay of most autism

00:38:11.689 --> 00:38:15.630
special education programs
and she's autistic,

00:38:15.630 --> 00:38:17.540
so yeah, we'll do PECS.

00:38:17.540 --> 00:38:19.721
She couldn't see them,
her parents asked us,

00:38:19.721 --> 00:38:21.580
why aren't they teaching her a form

00:38:21.580 --> 00:38:24.679
of tactile sign language,
she's frustrated and bored?

00:38:24.679 --> 00:38:27.000
And we asked the same question,

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:28.560
and we got them in contact with people

00:38:28.560 --> 00:38:30.653
who use these other methods.

00:38:31.639 --> 00:38:36.620
And there were very sincere people

00:38:36.620 --> 00:38:38.919
working really hard,
putting a lot of resources

00:38:38.919 --> 00:38:43.919
into helping this person
with evidence-based methods

00:38:44.070 --> 00:38:48.265
but the assessment of what the,

00:38:48.265 --> 00:38:52.430
the assessment of her unique traits

00:38:52.430 --> 00:38:54.230
and characteristics wasn't there.

00:38:54.230 --> 00:38:57.890
And it ended up frustrating her,

00:38:57.890 --> 00:39:01.221
leading to behavioral issues
and frustrating the staff

00:39:01.221 --> 00:39:04.270
who were working so, so hard at something

00:39:04.270 --> 00:39:06.460
that just wasn't getting them anywhere.

00:39:06.460 --> 00:39:11.460
They kept, it's frustrating
if you've ever been judged

00:39:12.300 --> 00:39:14.142
based on whether someone's making progress

00:39:14.142 --> 00:39:17.353
in those measurable
objectives and they aren't.

00:39:19.246 --> 00:39:21.340
And they're not going to if
you're using the wrong method

00:39:21.340 --> 00:39:23.719
because you have the wrong diagnosis.

00:39:23.719 --> 00:39:26.293
You have the wrong understanding
of what the issues are.

00:39:31.620 --> 00:39:34.160
I don't want you to just listen to me.

00:39:34.160 --> 00:39:36.910
I want you to listen to what
self-advocates are saying.

00:39:38.080 --> 00:39:40.110
We need to listen to
what they're telling us

00:39:40.110 --> 00:39:43.350
about what works for them
so let's hear directly

00:39:43.350 --> 00:39:45.565
from a self-advocate
about their experience

00:39:45.565 --> 00:39:49.420
living with these sensory
and movement differences.

00:39:49.420 --> 00:39:53.610
This video is, this video shows

00:39:53.610 --> 00:39:57.067
what it's like to be trapped
inside an unruly body.

00:39:57.067 --> 00:39:59.630
The video's about seven minutes

00:39:59.630 --> 00:40:02.320
and it might be emotional for some people

00:40:02.320 --> 00:40:04.853
so feel free to take a
break if you need to.

00:40:10.200 --> 00:40:12.371
- My son Payam was asked
to give a presentation

00:40:12.371 --> 00:40:16.340
at Georgia Tech in February of 2018

00:40:16.340 --> 00:40:19.480
at the Innovations in
Education Conference.

00:40:19.480 --> 00:40:20.830
He titled his speech

00:40:20.830 --> 00:40:24.370
Rethinking Autism and
Therapeutic Approaches.

00:40:24.370 --> 00:40:26.356
Payam decided to open and close live

00:40:26.356 --> 00:40:29.360
in front of the audience
in order to show them

00:40:29.360 --> 00:40:32.270
the effort and time it takes to spell out

00:40:32.270 --> 00:40:35.183
each word letter by
letter on the keyboard.

00:40:58.685 --> 00:40:59.518
There once was a time in my life

00:40:59.518 --> 00:41:01.130
where I struggled to feel included

00:41:01.130 --> 00:41:03.210
in the world that surrounded me.

00:41:03.210 --> 00:41:05.864
Tears would sometime pour
like rain on a river.

00:41:05.864 --> 00:41:08.800
The thought of never expressing

00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:12.834
my wonderful, deep inner
thoughts scared me tremendously.

00:41:12.834 --> 00:41:16.050
Would my parents see the real me?

00:41:16.050 --> 00:41:18.040
Will they truly hear my passion

00:41:18.040 --> 00:41:20.300
to learn from others who, like me,

00:41:20.300 --> 00:41:22.650
have dealt with adversity?

00:41:22.650 --> 00:41:27.124
These are the questions I ask
myself from a very young age.

00:41:27.124 --> 00:41:29.150
Trying to make sense of the world

00:41:29.150 --> 00:41:33.325
became a game I played daily
in order to occupy myself.

00:41:33.325 --> 00:41:36.210
Hearing words and conversations

00:41:36.210 --> 00:41:40.130
filled my wandering mind
with meaningful thoughts.

00:41:40.130 --> 00:41:42.280
The challenge was that outsiders

00:41:42.280 --> 00:41:46.430
could not see or measure the
intelligence I was acquiring.

00:41:46.430 --> 00:41:48.780
For years, I underwent various types

00:41:48.780 --> 00:41:51.050
of treatments and therapies.

00:41:51.050 --> 00:41:53.254
This was frustrating at times,

00:41:53.254 --> 00:41:56.480
but without a real way
to express my opinions,

00:41:56.480 --> 00:41:59.360
I faced treatments with bravery.

00:41:59.360 --> 00:42:01.180
Figuring out that I may be trapped

00:42:01.180 --> 00:42:05.670
in silence forever occurred
to me around the age of nine.

00:42:05.670 --> 00:42:09.820
This realization was both
startling and freeing for me.

00:42:09.820 --> 00:42:12.509
The truth is, I never gave up on the idea

00:42:12.509 --> 00:42:14.520
that there would be a time for others

00:42:14.520 --> 00:42:18.970
to find out I was trapped
inside an unruly body

00:42:18.970 --> 00:42:21.513
with a lousy mouth that disobeyed.

00:42:23.060 --> 00:42:25.090
I still have moments when I'm tired

00:42:25.090 --> 00:42:27.040
of having to deal with the nonsense

00:42:27.040 --> 00:42:29.380
my body gets wrapped up in.

00:42:29.380 --> 00:42:32.440
Tireless days are spent
growing against impulses

00:42:32.440 --> 00:42:35.973
that exhaust me and my
loved ones, yet I persevere.

00:42:35.973 --> 00:42:38.930
Safe days with loving teachers

00:42:38.930 --> 00:42:42.300
help remind me of all
I want to accomplish.

00:42:42.300 --> 00:42:44.358
Eventually, we found a way I could share

00:42:44.358 --> 00:42:48.070
my great mind with the world around me.

00:42:48.070 --> 00:42:50.550
Working meticulously hard, I learned how

00:42:50.550 --> 00:42:53.860
to harness my kind but careless body

00:42:53.860 --> 00:42:56.560
to spell out fearless thoughts.

00:42:56.560 --> 00:43:00.380
Each day I look forward
now, lucky to be surrounded

00:43:00.380 --> 00:43:03.210
by family and friends
who not only see through

00:43:03.210 --> 00:43:07.593
my outward facade but also the
other silent champions too.

00:43:08.480 --> 00:43:12.350
Challenging perceptions
will be my life's work.

00:43:12.350 --> 00:43:14.920
Creating shifts takes time.

00:43:14.920 --> 00:43:18.900
Respectful dialogues lessen
resistance to change.

00:43:18.900 --> 00:43:21.060
This must be carefully cultivated

00:43:21.060 --> 00:43:23.031
with professionals, educators,

00:43:23.031 --> 00:43:27.283
caregivers, and of course,
the individual who is in need.

00:43:28.306 --> 00:43:30.600
The time has come for professionals

00:43:30.600 --> 00:43:32.770
and educators to take
advice from advocates

00:43:32.770 --> 00:43:37.147
with personal experiences
with chaotic impulses.

00:43:37.147 --> 00:43:39.840
Try to imagine what life would be like

00:43:39.840 --> 00:43:42.300
living without direct control over

00:43:42.300 --> 00:43:45.730
words, limbs, and motor actions.

00:43:45.730 --> 00:43:47.594
This way of living is all I know.

00:43:47.594 --> 00:43:50.849
Speech would be helpful
or so one might think.

00:43:50.849 --> 00:43:53.510
Not always the case.

00:43:53.510 --> 00:43:57.090
Imagine saying every inner
thought uncontrollably,

00:43:57.090 --> 00:43:59.210
or getting trapped in a repetitive

00:43:59.210 --> 00:44:01.900
pattern of nonsense chatter.

00:44:01.900 --> 00:44:04.260
But nothing is worse than being perceived

00:44:04.260 --> 00:44:07.460
as less capable than you truly are.

00:44:07.460 --> 00:44:10.050
My friends and I have dealt with this lack

00:44:10.050 --> 00:44:13.390
of honest understanding most of our lives.

00:44:13.390 --> 00:44:15.931
Try to see past this and ask yourself,

00:44:15.931 --> 00:44:18.483
what more could be missing?

00:44:18.483 --> 00:44:20.708
What strategies could be used to support

00:44:20.708 --> 00:44:25.250
an individual in school,
home or the community?

00:44:25.250 --> 00:44:26.792
This evolution will take time to unfold.

00:44:26.792 --> 00:44:30.041
Progressive thinkers
will need to carefully

00:44:30.041 --> 00:44:33.778
help traditional professionals
find new strategies.

00:44:33.778 --> 00:44:36.940
Respectful advocates will open minds

00:44:36.940 --> 00:44:39.816
with their wise insights and perspectives.

00:44:39.816 --> 00:44:42.170
Let us work together to create

00:44:42.170 --> 00:44:45.194
dynamic shifts for future generations.

00:44:45.194 --> 00:44:47.702
This is my opportunity to give input,

00:44:47.702 --> 00:44:51.833
but there are many more
who need to be heard too.

00:44:51.833 --> 00:44:55.245
The most important piece
to any child's success

00:44:55.245 --> 00:44:58.400
is to feel included, this is difficult

00:44:58.400 --> 00:45:02.046
for educators to problem
solve without the right tools.

00:45:02.046 --> 00:45:06.218
Identifying the right
tool should be a priority.

00:45:06.218 --> 00:45:08.851
For me, it was learning to communicate

00:45:08.851 --> 00:45:12.550
by spelling each word on stencil boards.

00:45:12.550 --> 00:45:16.430
Each individual may require
their own unique supports.

00:45:16.430 --> 00:45:18.640
Do not deny anyone this right,

00:45:18.640 --> 00:45:21.630
regardless of what your opinion may be.

00:45:21.630 --> 00:45:23.320
There are times when individuals

00:45:23.320 --> 00:45:26.660
with tough bodies will
challenge your patience.

00:45:26.660 --> 00:45:28.630
Try to care for us the way you hope

00:45:28.630 --> 00:45:31.480
to be cared for in your time of need.

00:45:31.480 --> 00:45:35.330
Treat us with kindness, pay
attention to our patterns,

00:45:35.330 --> 00:45:39.530
and help us to learn strategies
to redirect our body.

00:45:39.530 --> 00:45:42.620
Never underestimate what we can learn.

00:45:42.620 --> 00:45:45.270
Fortunately there are plenty of advocates

00:45:45.270 --> 00:45:48.150
who can back this up with examples.

00:45:48.150 --> 00:45:49.570
It is not just what our brains

00:45:49.570 --> 00:45:52.690
are capable of, but our bodies too.

00:45:52.690 --> 00:45:56.150
Figuring out how to support a
rhetorically challenged body

00:45:56.150 --> 00:45:59.890
requires deep introspection
from all parties.

00:45:59.890 --> 00:46:04.340
My teachers are not confused
by my seemingly random habits.

00:46:04.340 --> 00:46:06.240
Instead they organize my actions

00:46:06.240 --> 00:46:09.330
with meaningful activities,
training my brain

00:46:09.330 --> 00:46:12.168
to focus on exercises, games, and tasks,

00:46:12.168 --> 00:46:15.560
that will utilize both my brain and body.

00:46:15.560 --> 00:46:18.370
Communicating has been the best support

00:46:18.370 --> 00:46:21.960
in giving me something
to focus my energy on.

00:46:21.960 --> 00:46:25.270
The more we talk about this
as a community the better.

00:46:25.270 --> 00:46:27.845
Every single person interacting

00:46:27.845 --> 00:46:29.150
with those with brain-body disconnect

00:46:29.150 --> 00:46:31.680
can have an impact on our lives.

00:46:31.680 --> 00:46:33.850
There must be fundamental changes

00:46:33.850 --> 00:46:37.460
in our belief in all of humanity.

00:46:37.460 --> 00:46:39.670
Treating individual people as though

00:46:39.670 --> 00:46:41.870
they not only matter but can make

00:46:41.870 --> 00:46:44.810
a difference in this world is essential.

00:46:44.810 --> 00:46:46.550
Help make this happen.

00:46:46.550 --> 00:46:50.350
Opportunities for those like
me are harder to come by.

00:46:50.350 --> 00:46:52.280
You all have the power to influence

00:46:52.280 --> 00:46:56.247
your families, peers, and
professional communities.

00:46:56.247 --> 00:46:57.863
Can you rise up?

00:47:04.180 --> 00:47:06.210
- Payam isn't alone.

00:47:06.210 --> 00:47:09.760
I have another non-speaking self-advocate

00:47:09.760 --> 00:47:12.080
responded to the
question, what do you want

00:47:12.080 --> 00:47:15.770
professionals to know about
communication with these words.

00:47:15.770 --> 00:47:18.167
What I want people to
know about communication

00:47:18.167 --> 00:47:20.870
is that it has nothing
to do with intelligence.

00:47:20.870 --> 00:47:22.830
It's a motor planning issue.

00:47:22.830 --> 00:47:26.220
Before basic scientists
researched brain anatomy,

00:47:26.220 --> 00:47:30.915
psychiatrists assumed that
autistic behavior is purposeful.

00:47:30.915 --> 00:47:34.880
This has caused problems
for autistic people

00:47:34.880 --> 00:47:37.190
all over the world, it isn't helpful

00:47:37.190 --> 00:47:39.920
to do drills or positive behavior plans

00:47:39.920 --> 00:47:42.000
because they don't work
on the brain disfunction

00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:43.920
that makes speech hard.

00:47:43.920 --> 00:47:45.510
Another reason they don't work

00:47:45.510 --> 00:47:48.316
is because they cause
anxiety and low self-esteem.

00:47:48.316 --> 00:47:50.870
Many people believe they're helping

00:47:50.870 --> 00:47:52.560
because they make charts and graphs

00:47:52.560 --> 00:47:54.910
and errorless learning models.

00:47:54.910 --> 00:47:58.390
It's as if they don't know that
people learn from mistakes.

00:47:58.390 --> 00:48:01.390
Behavioral training is
merely drilling motor plans,

00:48:01.390 --> 00:48:03.970
so with a prompt you get
the response you want.

00:48:03.970 --> 00:48:06.740
But it isn't neccesarily
the response intended.

00:48:06.740 --> 00:48:11.240
The intent may be help, stop,
you're underestimating me.

00:48:11.240 --> 00:48:13.650
I want to learn regular lessons.

00:48:13.650 --> 00:48:16.194
Talk to me normally, stop patronizing me.

00:48:16.194 --> 00:48:19.460
It's making me fear for my future.

00:48:19.460 --> 00:48:21.040
Let me understand my body

00:48:21.040 --> 00:48:23.253
and harness it so we can be friends.

00:48:26.140 --> 00:48:28.422
The basic science of autism

00:48:28.422 --> 00:48:31.250
and the sensory movement differences

00:48:31.250 --> 00:48:33.560
and the study of dyspraxia and autism

00:48:33.560 --> 00:48:36.118
is expanding rapidly but it still

00:48:36.118 --> 00:48:40.173
doesn't constitute a coherent story.

00:48:41.548 --> 00:48:46.250
Research can only answer
very narrow questions.

00:48:46.250 --> 00:48:48.480
Even without a full understanding though,

00:48:48.480 --> 00:48:50.690
it's pretty clear to me that this line

00:48:50.690 --> 00:48:52.864
of basic science research
is on the right track

00:48:52.864 --> 00:48:56.600
and it correlates much
better with what we observe.

00:48:56.600 --> 00:48:59.010
I hope that you will explore the resources

00:48:59.010 --> 00:49:03.270
that are in your packet and on this slide.

00:49:03.270 --> 00:49:06.360
And next year, if you are interested,

00:49:06.360 --> 00:49:09.114
we may be able to convince
the conference chairs

00:49:09.114 --> 00:49:11.860
to invite educators and parents

00:49:11.860 --> 00:49:13.506
and self-advocates who are finding ways

00:49:13.506 --> 00:49:16.160
to harness their unruly bodies

00:49:16.160 --> 00:49:19.240
to meet with you and
talk to you in person.

00:49:19.240 --> 00:49:22.353
Thank you.
