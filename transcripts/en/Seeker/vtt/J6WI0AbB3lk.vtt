00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:05.950
This episode of DNews was proudly made possible
by the all-new 2015 Subaru Legacy.

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:09.110
It's not just a sedan, it's a Subaru.

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:14.110
Ebola is a horrific infection that causes
a horrible messy death, but technically…

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:16.100
it's not the infection that kills you.

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:18.680
It's you that kills you.

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:25.470
Hey DNewsers, Trace here.

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.951
Ebola is ravaging West Africa, with over 1,400
dead and almost 3,000 infected.[a][b] The

00:00:30.951 --> 00:00:33.100
outbreak is real, and horrible.

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:37.060
And though it is a terrible infection, it's
not the virus, it's your immune system that's

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:39.180
doing the killing due to a cytokine[c] storm.

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.510
But before we get ahead of ourselves, lemme
explain how we got here.

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.380
Ebola or EVD was first identified in 1972[d].

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:50.740
Two simultaneous outbreaks occurred in the
Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo.

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:55.530
Those two were likely infected by fruit bats,
and the virus was named for the Ebola river,

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.710
which runs by the town in DRC where the virus
was found.

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:04.890
Today, the outbreak is happening in West Africa,
2,500 miles from the DRC, probably taken there

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:05.890
by fruit bats.

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:06.890
[e]

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:12.060
When a REGULAR virus infects you, cytokines
are created in response to send signals to

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.060
the immune system.

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:16.810
A cytokine is a protein produced by your body
to send signals between cells.

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:20.509
There are many different kinds of cytokines
and they're used by a bunch of your systems

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:22.270
-- including the immune system.

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:27.090
The system then sends out dendritic cells,
which eat the infection, learn about it and

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.009
then tell the immune system to produce antibodies,
which stop the brothers of that virus from

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:32.499
further infecting the body.

00:01:32.499 --> 00:01:37.179
When ebola infects your body, it attacks those
immune systems that launch the dendritic cells

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:38.179
first.

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:42.619
Without that dendritic instruction, the antibodies
don't have any blueprints to use to combat

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:43.640
the virus.

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:49.689
Thus, ebola replicates unabashedly, exploding
cells and running wild, and eventually immune

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:52.700
system throws everything it has to try and
stop it.

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.200
That's the cytokine storm!

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.170
The cytokine storm is like your body's version
of DefCon 1… all your body's defenses come

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:01.859
shooting into your bloodstream.

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:06.939
There are antibodies and white blood cells
flying everywhere trying to destroy the infestation,

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:12.560
but like Total Thermonuclear War from WarGames:
it does harm the enemy virus, but neither

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:13.560
side wins.

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:14.610
Virologist Gaya Amarasinghe explained the
whole thing to NPR and to put it simply, due

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:19.260
to the cytokine storm, the walls of your blood
vessels become more permeable; thus blood

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:25.070
and plasma leaks into surrounding tissue,
and sometimes out of the eyes, ears, and nose[f],

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:26.090
taking ebola with it.

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:31.190
In response to it's own onslaught, your body
releases nitric oxide t[g]o try and regulate

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:35.390
your blood pressure, but that nitric oxide
damages the blood vessels even more, thinning

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:38.570
your blood and dropping your pressure further.

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:42.460
This causes something like septic shock, -- or
shock due to low blood pressure.

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:43.460
So YES, ebola was killing your cells anyway
and nothing was going to reign it in.

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:44.460
But the virologist put it this way, "The immune
system is doing way more damage than good."

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:46.320
As you probably know, ebola is spread by infected
bodily fluids.

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:51.740
That includes blood, plasma, stool, and urine…
but also spit that might fly during conversation,

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:55.270
sweat, and fluids that leaks out of the body
after death.

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:59.780
The World Health Organization[h] says it's
almost always Human-to-Human (though it CAN

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:04.180
be from infected meat) and it takes between
48 hours and three weeks before a newly-infected

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:05.870
person shows symptoms.

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:09.380
They also say there are no vaccines and no
proven treatments.

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:14.120
Though, it's important to note that infection
isn't a death sentence, because 47 percent

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:15.340
of ebola carriers survive!

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:17.430
How does this make you feel about your immune
system?

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:18.560
Also, do you like WarGames?

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:20.130
Because that movie was awesome.

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:22.650
We've got a comment section, so USE IT!

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:26.580
For more information on ebola cures, check
out Carin's video, and come say hello to me

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:28.020
on Twitter, I'm Trace Dominguez.

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:29.060
