00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:07.320
Lynx is a mobile
3D imaging company.

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:09.970
We create software that
runs on mobile devices that

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:13.254
allows the devices to capture
3D models and measurements as

00:00:13.254 --> 00:00:14.795
quickly and easily
as shooting video.

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:20.390
We were doing
research to advance

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:22.280
the state of the
art in 3D imaging.

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:24.400
And that was successful
so we increased

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.630
the speed of 3D imaging by
two orders of magnitude,

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.450
we reduced the cost by
at least a factor of 10.

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:33.980
And when we decided to build
a commercial enterprise,

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:36.790
we had a great
technology asset and we

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:38.430
had to get a product
out in the wild.

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.590
So we made a decision I think
a lot of startups face, which

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:47.550
is do we build something right
or do we built it for people?

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.340
So we built a hardware platform
just to get it out in the wild,

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:53.710
learn from our customers,
do customer discovery

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:55.120
and market development.

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:59.130
And people were buying
hardware for the longest time,

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:03.430
but over the last two years,
the rest of the industry

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:04.640
has developed as well.

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.390
So in the meantime,
Google, for example,

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:10.410
has announced a 3D imaging
platform called Project Tango,

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:12.910
and our software will
soon be running on that.

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:16.950
And there are additional other
platform competitors as well.
