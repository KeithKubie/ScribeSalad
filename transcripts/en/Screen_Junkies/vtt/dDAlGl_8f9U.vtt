00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:12.260
From the director responsible for all things Tim Allen,

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:14.920
comes the film that asks children to imagine:

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:16.780
What if Santa was real?

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:22.520
And what if he was a legally binding curse inflicted on whoever stole the pants off Santa's dead body?

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.880
This movie is why a whole generation can't spell his name.

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:28.580
Huh.

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:31.920
Return to the Christmas of 90's past,

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.060
"Ho ho ho!"

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:36.260
Where, just like a pop star making a half-baked Christmas album,

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:39.840
Actors at the height of their powers

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.080
would pump out a half-baked Christmas movie

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:46.120
That you think is a classic because you were a kid when it came out and didn't know any better.

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:49.940
Meet Scott Calvin,

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:51.420
a careerist jerk.

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.520
He's fighting his jerk ex-wife.

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.300
And her jerk boyfriend.

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.280
Over custody of their jerk kid!

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:59.840
"You never do what I want to do! - Would you please be quiet?"

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.060
But, when he fourth-degree murders Santa Claus,

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:04.900
he'll take his job, give it his own jerk flair...

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:06.480
"How come you don't have a beard?"

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:07.800
"Do you want this doll or not?"

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:08.780
"Go back to sleep."

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.240
...get fat-shamed by his jerk coworkers,

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.540
You're starting to look like the Pillsbury Dough Boy!

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:18.180
...then lose his career, clean legal record, and son in the process!

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.160
Uh, 'happy' holidays, I guess?

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.800
Experience a film all about the magic of Christmas

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.240
that sucks all the magic out of Christmas.

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.920
Where Santa isn't a man, but a job title.

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.980
Santa dies so often, the rules of succession are printed on his business card.

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:39.040
And Santa's physique isn't a choice,

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.880
but a virus that twists the host's body into a Santa shaped mass

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.560
from which there is no escape.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.040
Hmm, I wonder what would happen if a woman killed Santa.

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:50.220
Or a child. Or a dog.

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:51.920
"I'm Santa Paws now."

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.960
They made a movie out of that too?

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:54.840
Woof.

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.020
Prepare to believe again.

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.440
Specifically the belief that therapy is for losers.

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:01.400
"He's not a doctor, he's a psychiatrist."

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.840
As this broken family drama makes it clear

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.660
Santa and psychiatry don't mix.

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:07.160
"He's not Santa."

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:08.760
"He is too Santa!"

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.160
Where not only is all mental health advice stupid,

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.800
but the whole reason the hero believes in Santa

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.620
is to get revenge on his ex-wife for dating a shrink.

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.260
"He doesn't believe in Santa."

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:19.980
"Well, Neil's head comes to a point."

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.160
"Go ahead, Dr. Miller."

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.040
"I guess we know who's the teacher's pet."

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.160
"Scott! Oh, grow up."

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:26.400
"He listens to me."

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:27.540
"Then he charges you for it."

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.100
Ho ho, holy moly

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.000
Someone's got some issues to work on.

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:36.500
Journey to the North Pole for a strange new take on Santa's Workshop.

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.500
With its own paramilitary squad that operates outside of human law.

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:41.700
"We're your worst nightmare."

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.900
Eternal child brides trained to service Santa's every need.

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.220
"You look pretty good for your age."

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:50.600
And Bernard, a cruel taskmaster who keeps the workers toiling away at their stations.

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.600
"Excuse me, are we on a coffee break?"

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:57.260
And blackmail Santa into leaving his old life behind or else Christmas is dead for everyone.

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:01.260
"You wouldn't want to be responsible for killing the spirit of Christmas, now would you?"

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.220
There is no way this place has a union.

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:06.340
So revisit this 90's throwback

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:08.560
that makes everyone's fantasies come true.

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:11.240
From kid's fantasies that Santa is real,

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.020
parent's fantasies that their children will respect them,

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:16.880
the studio's fantasies that this movie deserved a trilogy,

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:21.200
and Tim Allen's fantasy that he wouldn't immediately crack in a police interrogation.

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:22.020
"Name"

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:23.800
"???"

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:26.780
Unlike, y'know, what ACTUALLY happened.

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:27.840
Look it up.

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:49.920
"You're gonna make a great psychiatrist one day, kid."

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:52.100
"No"

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:55.720
"I think I'm going to go into the family business."

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.100
So... you're gonna kill your dad?

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:03.060
