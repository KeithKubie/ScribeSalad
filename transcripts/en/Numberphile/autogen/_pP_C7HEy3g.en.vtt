he - we could - here you couldn't do
 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.299
he - we could - here you couldn't do
that because it's not moving - it's not

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309
that because it's not moving - it's not
 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.160
that because it's not moving - it's not
touching - other coins so this one here

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170
touching - other coins so this one here
 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.160
touching - other coins so this one here
you can move it - there you could move

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170
you can move it - there you could move
 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.640

just spit it has to be touching to other
 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.490
just spit it has to be touching to other
coins and what I want I want you to get

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500
coins and what I want I want you to get
 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.850
coins and what I want I want you to get
from there to here

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860
from there to here
 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.240
from there to here
in three moves you can do it in four or

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250
in three moves you can do it in four or
 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.340
in three moves you can do it in four or
five moves pretty much straight away but

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350
five moves pretty much straight away but
 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.940
five moves pretty much straight away but
to get it in three moves does take a bit

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950
to get it in three moves does take a bit
 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.410
to get it in three moves does take a bit
of thought does take a bit of thought

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420
of thought does take a bit of thought
 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.740
of thought does take a bit of thought
and quite often you forget how to do it

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750
and quite often you forget how to do it
 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.810
and quite often you forget how to do it
so you could be on another train journey

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820
so you could be on another train journey
 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.319
so you could be on another train journey
and get it out and this puzzle here was

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329
and get it out and this puzzle here was
 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.060
and get it out and this puzzle here was
really the beginning of there are lots

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070
really the beginning of there are lots
 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.760
really the beginning of there are lots
of other in the genre of you've got a

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770
of other in the genre of you've got a
 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.109
of other in the genre of you've got a
certain amount of coins there in one

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119
certain amount of coins there in one
 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:46.370
certain amount of coins there in one
pattern you've got to make another

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380
pattern you've got to make another
 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:47.840
pattern you've got to make another
pattern and you can only do it by

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850
pattern and you can only do it by
 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.819
pattern and you can only do it by
sliding it to a place that's touching to

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829
sliding it to a place that's touching to
 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:52.160
sliding it to a place that's touching to
others what you don't want to do is lots

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170
others what you don't want to do is lots
 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.569
others what you don't want to do is lots
of people start like this they think

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579
of people start like this they think
 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:56.630
of people start like this they think
well I can do this but then this one's

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640
well I can do this but then this one's
 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.179
well I can do this but then this one's
trapped because you can't move that one

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189
trapped because you can't move that one
 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.160
trapped because you can't move that one
out because these two are doing it so

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170
out because these two are doing it so
 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.740
out because these two are doing it so
you you've got it and you can't take it

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750
you you've got it and you can't take it
 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.870
you you've got it and you can't take it
up so you can only do it by sliding and

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880
up so you can only do it by sliding and
 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.670
up so you can only do it by sliding and
you're not allowed to move any others so

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680
you're not allowed to move any others so
 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.830
you're not allowed to move any others so
the way that you would solve it just

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840
the way that you would solve it just
 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:15.110
the way that you would solve it just
remember on earth I did it is yeah you

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120
remember on earth I did it is yeah you
 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:21.380

started writing about puzzles when I
 

00:03:46.889 --> 00:03:50.240
started writing about puzzles when I
realized how viral they could go and as

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250
realized how viral they could go and as
 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:53.690
realized how viral they could go and as
I researched it I realized that every

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700
I researched it I realized that every
 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.370
I researched it I realized that every
puzzle that I was reading from someone
