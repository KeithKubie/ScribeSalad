00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:04.680
If we could go
back 100,000 years,

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.230
the closest thing that
there would be to a dog

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.150
would be their
ancestor, the wolf.

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.030
And these were fearsome
predators and probably not

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.190
animals that humans
out on the savannah

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.910
would be wanting to spend a lot
of time in close contact with.

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.160
Wolves domesticated
themselves, so wolves

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.730
started becoming interested
in human populations.

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.840
And they realized that they
could get some leftover scraps

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.700
of food and human refuse.

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:31.950
It was probably the wolves
that were the least fearful

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:33.330
and the least
aggressive who were

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:37.920
most successful in this niche on
the outskirts of human society.

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.775
And probably for
much of history,

00:00:40.775 --> 00:00:43.400
we have not lived with dogs the
way that we live with dogs now.

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:46.290
In fact, most of the modern
breeds that we think about,

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:48.690
these are creations in the
last couple of hundred years.

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.090
They're products of
the Victorian era,

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.840
for the most part.

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:57.360
But we have a very deep
history with dogs going back

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.190
before this period
that we recognize

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.237
now was the way that
humans relate to dogs that

00:01:01.237 --> 00:01:03.570
is much richer and certainly
goes back tens of thousands

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.180
of years.
