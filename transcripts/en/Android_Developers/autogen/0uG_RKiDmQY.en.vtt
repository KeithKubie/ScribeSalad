acceleration for encryption and so

00:07:39.470 --> 00:07:39.480
acceleration for encryption and so
 

00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:41.060
acceleration for encryption and so
encryption on those devices causes

00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:41.070
encryption on those devices causes
 

00:07:41.070 --> 00:07:42.920
encryption on those devices causes
noticeable slowdowns and makes the

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:42.930
noticeable slowdowns and makes the
 

00:07:42.930 --> 00:07:46.040
noticeable slowdowns and makes the
device hard to use and this affects not

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:46.050
device hard to use and this affects not
 

00:07:46.050 --> 00:07:48.190

similar smart connected devices often we

00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:53.400
similar smart connected devices often we
 

00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:55.550
similar smart connected devices often we
use the same hardware as in phones and

00:07:55.550 --> 00:07:55.560
use the same hardware as in phones and
 

00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:57.230
use the same hardware as in phones and
so they inherit the same hardware

00:07:57.230 --> 00:07:57.240
so they inherit the same hardware
 

00:07:57.240 --> 00:08:01.400

using a weak key you can now ask Google

00:15:52.849 --> 00:15:52.859
using a weak key you can now ask Google
 

00:15:52.859 --> 00:15:55.009
using a weak key you can now ask Google
Play to manage a second stronger key on

your app installed all update to that
 

00:16:04.229 --> 00:16:05.629
your app installed all update to that
app will continue to be signed by the

00:16:05.629 --> 00:16:05.639
app will continue to be signed by the
 

00:16:05.639 --> 00:16:09.319
app will continue to be signed by the
original key now on the other hand for

00:16:09.319 --> 00:16:09.329
original key now on the other hand for
 

00:16:09.329 --> 00:16:11.239
original key now on the other hand for
your new users and returning users on

00:16:11.239 --> 00:16:11.249

devices that don't currently have your
 

00:16:12.839 --> 00:16:15.319
devices that don't currently have your
app installed new installs will be

00:16:15.319 --> 00:16:15.329
app installed new installs will be
 

00:16:15.329 --> 00:16:17.029
app installed new installs will be
signed by the new key and an update to

00:16:17.029 --> 00:16:17.039
signed by the new key and an update to
 

00:16:17.039 --> 00:16:19.269
signed by the new key and an update to
that will also be signed by the new key

00:16:19.269 --> 00:16:19.279
that will also be signed by the new key
 

00:16:19.279 --> 00:16:21.829
that will also be signed by the new key
so this is how we can gradually move

00:16:21.829 --> 00:16:21.839
so this is how we can gradually move
 

00:16:21.839 --> 00:16:23.929
so this is how we can gradually move
your user base to primarily using the

00:16:23.929 --> 00:16:23.939
your user base to primarily using the
 

00:16:23.939 --> 00:16:27.829
your user base to primarily using the
original key to using the new key for

00:16:27.829 --> 00:16:27.839
original key to using the new key for
 

00:16:27.839 --> 00:16:32.059
original key to using the new key for
example when a user of yours buys a new

00:16:32.059 --> 00:16:32.069
example when a user of yours buys a new
 

00:16:32.069 --> 00:16:33.379
example when a user of yours buys a new
phone and installs your app on your

00:16:33.379 --> 00:16:33.389
phone and installs your app on your
 

00:16:33.389 --> 00:16:36.859
phone and installs your app on your
phone now you may be wondering why are

00:16:36.859 --> 00:16:36.869
phone now you may be wondering why are
 

00:16:36.869 --> 00:16:38.479
phone now you may be wondering why are
we using the new key only for new

00:16:38.479 --> 00:16:38.489
we using the new key only for new
 

00:16:38.489 --> 00:16:41.509
we using the new key only for new
installs the main reason here is that

00:16:41.509 --> 00:16:41.519
installs the main reason here is that
 

00:16:41.519 --> 00:16:44.210
installs the main reason here is that
older enjoyed platform versions do not

00:16:44.210 --> 00:16:44.220
older enjoyed platform versions do not
 

00:16:44.220 --> 00:16:46.669
older enjoyed platform versions do not
have great support for key rotation and

00:16:46.669 --> 00:16:46.679
have great support for key rotation and
 

00:16:46.679 --> 00:16:49.009
have great support for key rotation and
so if we try to update your app to a new

00:16:49.009 --> 00:16:49.019
so if we try to update your app to a new
 

00:16:49.019 --> 00:16:51.169
so if we try to update your app to a new
version signed by the by a different key

00:16:51.169 --> 00:16:51.179
version signed by the by a different key
 

00:16:51.179 --> 00:16:53.529
version signed by the by a different key
the platform will reject that update and

00:16:53.529 --> 00:16:53.539
the platform will reject that update and
 

00:16:53.539 --> 00:16:55.969
the platform will reject that update and
so this approach of gradually moving

00:16:55.969 --> 00:16:55.979
so this approach of gradually moving
 

00:16:55.979 --> 00:16:58.069
so this approach of gradually moving
your apps from using the old key to

00:16:58.069 --> 00:16:58.079
your apps from using the old key to
 

00:16:58.079 --> 00:16:59.899
your apps from using the old key to
using the new key is the most

00:16:59.899 --> 00:16:59.909
using the new key is the most
 

00:16:59.909 --> 00:17:05.329
using the new key is the most
non-destructive now the good news here

00:17:05.329 --> 00:17:05.339
non-destructive now the good news here
 

00:17:05.339 --> 00:17:07.939
non-destructive now the good news here
is that Android Pi added great support

00:17:07.939 --> 00:17:07.949
is that Android Pi added great support
 

00:17:07.949 --> 00:17:09.499
is that Android Pi added great support
for key rotation natively into the

00:17:09.499 --> 00:17:09.509
for key rotation natively into the
 

00:17:09.509 --> 00:17:11.720
for key rotation natively into the
platform and place support is coming as

00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:11.730
platform and place support is coming as
 

00:17:11.730 --> 00:17:14.899
platform and place support is coming as
well so in the future on new Android

00:17:14.899 --> 00:17:14.909
well so in the future on new Android
 

00:17:14.909 --> 00:17:16.699
well so in the future on new Android
platform versions we'll be able to move

00:17:16.699 --> 00:17:16.709

you need to check for dependencies on
 

00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:09.950
you need to check for dependencies on
that old signing key for example if

that recognize your app based on the
 

00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:15.890
that recognize your app based on the
sign-in key you'll probably want to

sign-in key you'll probably want to
 

00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:17.660
sign-in key you'll probably want to
update them to also recognize the new

and place report is coming as well so in

00:18:40.790 --> 00:18:40.800
and place report is coming as well so in
 

00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:42.710
and place report is coming as well so in
the future you'll be able to both rotate

00:18:42.710 --> 00:18:42.720
the future you'll be able to both rotate
 

00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:44.660
the future you'll be able to both rotate
your key as well as continue to use

so we talked about encryption of your

00:18:53.180 --> 00:18:53.190
so we talked about encryption of your
 

00:18:53.190 --> 00:18:55.340
so we talked about encryption of your
data rest encryption of your data in

to the last topic user authentication

00:19:03.820 --> 00:19:03.830
to the last topic user authentication
 

00:19:03.830 --> 00:19:06.530
to the last topic user authentication
this is another area where we've gotten

00:19:06.530 --> 00:19:06.540
this is another area where we've gotten
 

00:19:06.540 --> 00:19:08.060
this is another area where we've gotten
a lot of questions from users from

00:19:08.060 --> 00:19:08.070
a lot of questions from users from
 

00:19:08.070 --> 00:19:10.130
a lot of questions from users from
developers over the years and it's easy

00:19:10.130 --> 00:19:10.140
developers over the years and it's easy
 

00:19:10.140 --> 00:19:13.730
developers over the years and it's easy
to see why there there are a lot of

00:19:13.730 --> 00:19:13.740
to see why there there are a lot of
 

00:19:13.740 --> 00:19:15.800
to see why there there are a lot of
security sensitive apps such as banking

00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:15.810
security sensitive apps such as banking
 

00:19:15.810 --> 00:19:18.440
security sensitive apps such as banking
apps password managers that need to

00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:18.450
apps password managers that need to
 

00:19:18.450 --> 00:19:20.000
apps password managers that need to
prevent unauthorized access to their

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:20.010
prevent unauthorized access to their
 

00:19:20.010 --> 00:19:22.130
prevent unauthorized access to their
apps and so they need to authenticate

00:19:22.130 --> 00:19:22.140
apps and so they need to authenticate
 

00:19:22.140 --> 00:19:23.750
apps and so they need to authenticate
their users I'll dedicate their users on

00:19:23.750 --> 00:19:23.760
their users I'll dedicate their users on
 

00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:25.550
their users I'll dedicate their users on
a regular basis and we want to make that

00:19:25.550 --> 00:19:25.560
a regular basis and we want to make that
 

00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:29.540
a regular basis and we want to make that
easy so last year in order to do this we

00:19:29.540 --> 00:19:29.550
easy so last year in order to do this we
 

00:19:29.550 --> 00:19:32.080
easy so last year in order to do this we
launched the biometric prompt a pion

00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:32.090
launched the biometric prompt a pion
 

00:19:32.090 --> 00:19:35.960
launched the biometric prompt a pion
biometric prompts allows apps to give to

00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:35.970
biometric prompts allows apps to give to
 

00:19:35.970 --> 00:19:37.880
biometric prompts allows apps to give to
use a common interface to authenticate

00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:37.890
use a common interface to authenticate
 

00:19:37.890 --> 00:19:40.280
use a common interface to authenticate
and so users get a consistent experience

00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:40.290
and so users get a consistent experience
 

00:19:40.290 --> 00:19:42.890
and so users get a consistent experience
across all of their apps and biometric

00:19:42.890 --> 00:19:42.900
across all of their apps and biometric
 

00:19:42.900 --> 00:19:44.390
across all of their apps and biometric
prompt is built in a generic way to

00:19:44.390 --> 00:19:44.400
prompt is built in a generic way to
 

00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:46.310

since launch we've seen a lot of apps

00:19:51.889 --> 00:19:51.899
since launch we've seen a lot of apps
 

00:19:51.899 --> 00:19:54.289
since launch we've seen a lot of apps
adopt this and we've also noticed a few

00:19:54.289 --> 00:19:54.299
adopt this and we've also noticed a few
 

00:19:54.299 --> 00:19:58.220
adopt this and we've also noticed a few
gaps in coverage and so this year we've

00:19:58.220 --> 00:19:58.230
gaps in coverage and so this year we've
 

00:19:58.230 --> 00:20:00.139
gaps in coverage and so this year we've
updated the underlying framework with

00:20:00.139 --> 00:20:00.149
updated the underlying framework with
 

00:20:00.149 --> 00:20:01.460
updated the underlying framework with
more robust support for face and

00:20:01.460 --> 00:20:01.470
more robust support for face and
 

00:20:01.470 --> 00:20:03.529
more robust support for face and
fingerprints and we've also updated the

00:20:03.529 --> 00:20:03.539
fingerprints and we've also updated the
 

00:20:03.539 --> 00:20:06.009
fingerprints and we've also updated the
API to support more use cases

00:20:06.009 --> 00:20:06.019

great feature is that apps can now allow

00:21:53.810 --> 00:21:53.820
great feature is that apps can now allow
 

00:21:53.820 --> 00:21:57.529
great feature is that apps can now allow
give users the option of using of having

00:21:57.529 --> 00:21:57.539
give users the option of using of having
 

00:21:57.539 --> 00:21:59.769
give users the option of using of having
more options to authenticate to the app

00:21:59.769 --> 00:21:59.779
more options to authenticate to the app
 

00:21:59.779 --> 00:22:02.060
more options to authenticate to the app
this is really useful in situations

00:22:02.060 --> 00:22:02.070
this is really useful in situations
 

00:22:02.070 --> 00:22:03.549
this is really useful in situations
where biometric authentication

00:22:03.549 --> 00:22:03.559
where biometric authentication
 

00:22:03.559 --> 00:22:05.560
where biometric authentication
may not work very well such as face

00:22:05.560 --> 00:22:05.570
may not work very well such as face
 

00:22:05.570 --> 00:22:06.970
may not work very well such as face

authentication in poor lighting
 

00:22:06.980 --> 00:22:10.360
authentication in poor lighting
conditions so in those situations apps

00:22:10.360 --> 00:22:10.370
conditions so in those situations apps
 

00:22:10.370 --> 00:22:13.090
conditions so in those situations apps
can now give users the option to use

00:22:13.090 --> 00:22:13.100
can now give users the option to use
 

00:22:13.100 --> 00:22:15.610
can now give users the option to use
their device pin pattern password to

00:22:15.610 --> 00:22:15.620
their device pin pattern password to
 

00:22:15.620 --> 00:22:17.499
their device pin pattern password to
authenticate to the app which can give a

00:22:17.499 --> 00:22:17.509
authenticate to the app which can give a
 

00:22:17.509 --> 00:22:19.299
authenticate to the app which can give a
much better user experience in those

00:22:19.299 --> 00:22:19.309
much better user experience in those
 

00:22:19.309 --> 00:22:22.749
much better user experience in those
situations now of course it may not be

00:22:22.749 --> 00:22:22.759
situations now of course it may not be
 

00:22:22.759 --> 00:22:24.999
situations now of course it may not be
appropriate for all apps and so apps can

00:22:24.999 --> 00:22:25.009
appropriate for all apps and so apps can
 

00:22:25.009 --> 00:22:27.399
appropriate for all apps and so apps can
also not allow a fallback and that is

00:22:27.399 --> 00:22:27.409
also not allow a fallback and that is
 

00:22:27.409 --> 00:22:29.289
also not allow a fallback and that is
the default flow if you don't have a

00:22:29.289 --> 00:22:29.299
the default flow if you don't have a
 

00:22:29.299 --> 00:22:31.570
the default flow if you don't have a
fallback you can always use your app

00:22:31.570 --> 00:22:31.580
fallback you can always use your app
 

00:22:31.580 --> 00:22:33.340
fallback you can always use your app
specific methods such as your app

00:22:33.340 --> 00:22:33.350
specific methods such as your app
 

00:22:33.350 --> 00:22:35.769
specific methods such as your app
specific password to authenticate your

00:22:35.769 --> 00:22:35.779
specific password to authenticate your
 

00:22:35.779 --> 00:22:41.379
specific password to authenticate your
user okay so that was the second great

00:22:41.379 --> 00:22:41.389
user okay so that was the second great
 

00:22:41.389 --> 00:22:42.820
user okay so that was the second great
feature we'll talk about one last

00:22:42.820 --> 00:22:42.830
feature we'll talk about one last
 

00:22:42.830 --> 00:22:44.560
feature we'll talk about one last

00:22:44.560 --> 00:22:44.570
feature of a biometric Combinator cube
 

00:22:44.570 --> 00:22:48.609
feature of a biometric Combinator cube
and that is now that is that apps now

00:22:48.609 --> 00:22:48.619
and that is now that is that apps now
 

00:22:48.619 --> 00:22:51.129
and that is now that is that apps now
have the ability to check on the status

00:22:51.129 --> 00:22:51.139
have the ability to check on the status
 

00:22:51.139 --> 00:22:52.989
have the ability to check on the status
of biometric authentication on the
