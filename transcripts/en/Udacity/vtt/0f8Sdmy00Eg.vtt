00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.460
So when I'm advising companies
on what kind of, on pricing and

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:06.910
payment plans and how to think
about monetization strategies.

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:10.470
Again, asking them, hey is this

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:13.640
a big enough market that freemium will
sort of work, where a small percentage

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:18.310
conversion of a large pool will make
sense for this to be a large company and

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:20.950
so you can just work the math
backwards to make that work.

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:23.060
Most of them have easy
questions about pricing,

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:24.620
like, what do I start charging this on?

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:28.390
So the first comparison is like, do you
have competitors charging for this?

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:29.050
What do they charge?

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:29.870
How does this sort of work?

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:34.710
If you are thinking about
enterprise companies,

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.240
the way we usually do is try to
figure out like well, how much money

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:43.420
is the company already spending, on
whatever it is, to solve this problem?

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:46.250
Usually you're not solving
a problem that nobody's working on.

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:49.560
It's usually some problem that
already exists in the company and

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:51.090
you have a better way of doing it.

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.120
And so the companies that will do poorly
in an enterprise is when there's no

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:58.352
budget carved out for
solving a specific problem.

00:00:58.352 --> 00:00:59.740
So if there is no budget carved out,

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:03.920
it is almost impossible to figure out
how to generate money out of thin air.

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.510
People can only spend money that is
allocated to them by the division,

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:09.980
the company,
whatever the finances are at hand.

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:12.330
Then the next thing is just saying,

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.460
like how do you calculate how
much money you're spending on it?

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.150
So you just start off with like well
how many people was dedicated the task?

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:18.586
What's the average salary for
those people?

00:01:18.586 --> 00:01:20.624
How much time is spent, and
you can figure out there, and

00:01:20.624 --> 00:01:22.081
that's like your upper bound, right?

00:01:22.081 --> 00:01:23.965
And those people are already
working on the problem, so

00:01:23.965 --> 00:01:26.007
you can't just charge that upper
bound right to begin with,

00:01:26.007 --> 00:01:28.030
because basically you're saying
those people have a job.

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:29.910
And those people are probably going
to have to be your champions.

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:31.350
So you have to figure out some way,

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.260
it's like this somehow
eats a lot of their time.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.420
They want to do other parts of
their job, or what have you,

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.300
and you figure out some
in between on that.

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:41.580
And usually I say like figure
out some kind of smart guess and

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:42.780
just start with your first customer.

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.040
And for enterprise pricing,
you can adjust.

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:46.710
Depending on how fast
they answer the question,

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.100
you're going to move the price up or
down.

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.620
The biggest thing is just
start with some kind of model.

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:53.290
One of the biggest mistakes,
I think, some companies do,

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:57.870
is they start people off on free pilots,
that's like oh, just try it.

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:00.660
The program, we won't charge you
anything, we'll try it for 60 or

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:02.280
90 days, and
we'll figure out where we go from there.

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.300
And I think that's a poor
way of thinking about stuff.

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:08.460
Again, you don't set yourself
up to figure out how to one, map

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:12.010
out the organization, to figure out what
is it going to take to actually close,

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:13.640
you don't beta test your pricing.

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:14.970
As all these questions come near that,

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.210
you just are kicking
the can down the road, and

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:22.220
so what I usually advise is say look, we
don't have free trials in our company.

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:24.920
We can provide a service
that is of value.

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:26.335
Here's what I can do for you.

00:02:26.335 --> 00:02:30.090
We start off with a the three month
plan, it's going to cost this much money

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.330
and if you are not satisfied
with the product or

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:34.910
service, 100% money back guarantee.

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:37.730
But that way you can play the safe.

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:40.670
But that way you have gone
through the actual process of

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:45.150
navigating enterprise pricing and
payment and accounting, and

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.900
legal and all that stuff
just to get to that process.

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:51.130
And if they're not even interested
in that, then that means that maybe

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:53.480
you don't have a product that
people actually want to begin with.

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:00.440
The other one is to think about
incentives in terms of your sales force.

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.860
And also in terms of
people's reasons to buy.

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:07.470
And the best model I've ever heard
about this actually came from

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:10.100
Phil Libin from Evernote, and he
actually talked about a concept that he

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:12.900
learned from someone else, and
it was about the pricing thermometer.

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:17.630
And the idea is that there's three
numbers associated with, like, pricing.

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:20.710
And so you have like the cost
of the product here,

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:24.160
you have the price of the product, and
then you have the value of the product.

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:27.300
And those are three numbers
associated with a service or product.

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:32.000
And it says that gap between the cost
and the price of the product,

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.640
that is considered that gap in
distance is incentive to sell, right?

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:39.700
So because it's like oh, for

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:44.220
every one of these I sell I make
that much money as a company.

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:47.870
The gap between value to price,
that is incentive to buy for

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:49.550
the customer, right?

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:52.630
And so where you put the price
on the line controls

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:55.740
where are the pressures for
buying and selling.

00:03:55.740 --> 00:04:00.730
Right, and so, for example,
Evernote, they charge $30 a year,

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:03.746
and they've never changed that pricing.

00:04:03.746 --> 00:04:06.550
And the idea is like we want all

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:10.540
the energy around our software
service to be incentive to buy.

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:12.940
Right, because like wow.

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:16.290
This product all it sort of
offers has high value to me, so

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:17.180
it make me want to buy it.

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:20.399
And there's enough people and enough
pressure on there, makes it worth it.

00:04:20.399 --> 00:04:23.290
And what's amazing about that,
is if you can make that work,

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:27.940
it grows by word of mouth and
organically.

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:31.800
They don't need a huge sales force to
sell this because the value in itself

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:33.270
automatically makes
the sell sort of happen.

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:36.470
Usually a lot of people want to do is,

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:41.410
like figure out like how do I get
the price as close to value as possible.

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:46.710
And then what you do is you destroy one
of those impulses for sort of people.

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:49.940
And also,
the feedback loop that you generate for

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:52.230
your salespeople is
usually pretty broken.

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:53.390
Right?
because they'll do anything

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:55.650
to sort of sell it, and

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:58.150
the reason why people want to talk
about is completely different.

00:04:58.150 --> 00:04:59.910
It's like yeah,
it's going to be really expensive.

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:03.360
You kind of get what you pay for,
but I'm not super excited about it.

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:07.370
And anyone that is willing to increase
that gap in the other direction

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:09.630
can undercut you as a result.

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:13.250
And they undercut you not because,
oh this is a better price or

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:16.700
better value but it's because now
there is two pressures in there

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:19.530
to make you want to consume or
upgrade what have you
