00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I said that this was a similar triangle

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
and this was a similar triangle.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Let's take a look why.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
If I rotate this one just right,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
make it a little bit smaller,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
I've got the exact same triangle I had before.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Likewise for this one.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:30.000
If I move it, rotate it, and make it a bit bigger,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
I have the same triangle I had before.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Since I can't do that with any of these three triangles,

00:00:34.000 --> 99:59:59.000
they are not similar.
