1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:04,870
It's just,
it's very easy to just to just say,

2
00:00:04,871 --> 00:00:09,710
you know what, that's enough for
me and find what is like for me.

3
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:13,890
Yes. Everybody's, everybody's
humor is different. I, I love,

4
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:18,810
I love, there's a, there's
a, there's a viral video.

5
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:23,520
It is, uh, this old guy
trying to hover board.

6
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:28,170
He's like, fuck, he's
gotta be like 69, 70,

7
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:32,550
and you know, his grandkids there
and he's like, lemme lemme try it.

8
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:33,830
Lemme lemme try it.

9
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:37,950
And his man gets on his
hoverboard and taste.

10
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:41,070
If you saw Mike Tyson
following a hover board,

11
00:00:41,071 --> 00:00:43,650
his fall was worse than Mike Tyson's.

12
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:48,720
I've never seen somebody hit
their head harder and my life.

13
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:54,530
And I didn't laugh out of wanting
to see his old man hurt herself.

14
00:00:56,010 --> 00:01:00,870
I laughed because it was stupid to try
to get on his hoverboard in the first

15
00:01:00,871 --> 00:01:04,230
place. And when he got
up, he tells the kids,

16
00:01:04,630 --> 00:01:06,270
why is it moving like that?

17
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:14,440
I played this video,
everybody,

18
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:19,240
because that should made me laugh.
Some people will watch and go, oh, no,

19
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:23,380
no. Some people will watch it
and go, oh, whoa, Whoa, oh.

20
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:27,510
And other than just DAB by 11 because
everybody's humor is different. Yeah.

21
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:30,550
Everybody's fucking hammer is different.
My humor is different.

22
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:35,290
Fall in makes me laugh. I don't care
who you are. Falling makes me laugh.

23
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:40,020
I don't give a shit who you are. If
you fall in front of me. No Shadow.

24
00:01:40,021 --> 00:01:43,990
I'm holding a laugh. There's no shot.
There's no shot. You don't stand a chance.

25
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:48,880
If you fall in. Pardon me?
There is no shot that I'm not.

26
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:53,590
That was something son has
got to come out. Right.

27
00:01:53,770 --> 00:01:57,730
Falling is funny.
I still think it's hacky.

28
00:01:57,731 --> 00:01:59,750
I still think far too funny
when my kids fart. I laugh.

29
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:04,170
I still until this day is the funniest
shit ever to me. Guy Goes that Vu stick.

30
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:08,710
Get out of here. Stay gas. My little
son, 17 months when you fart, I laugh.

31
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:09,640
Something,

32
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:14,640
something within just the ability
to just be fucking silly and stupid.

33
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:18,130
Oh yeah. It doesn't always have
to have a meaning behind it.

34
00:02:18,131 --> 00:02:20,950
Some shit is just stupid.
My eight year old farts on cue.

35
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:23,980
She thinks it's hilarious as well
as Jeanie. She'll tell you, listen,

36
00:02:23,981 --> 00:02:27,910
I got to talk to you about some.
They'd go and she starts laughing.

37
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:30,160
She thinks it's hilarious.
She'll fall down on the couch.

38
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:30,880
The best thing in the world,

39
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:34,480
she can't stop laughing is the best
thing you're talking about as a kid.

40
00:02:34,481 --> 00:02:37,150
That's all you got.
Cause you only bit as a kid,

41
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,570
you got nothing else but farts.
That's all you get.

42
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:45,340
That's all you got to make people laugh.
You should enjoy it. Yeah. This shit,

43
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:48,190
I still think it's funny folly,
but falling is number one for me.

44
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:51,820
Falling is number one.
My wife fell down the steps.

45
00:02:51,821 --> 00:02:55,000
She got so mad because I didn't
rush to help her. I laugh.

46
00:02:56,320 --> 00:03:00,580
She had a wine glass. Wine
was all over the, Oh my God.

47
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:04,330
One of the wars falls I've ever
seen in my damn life got up.

48
00:03:04,331 --> 00:03:09,010
Her shoe was on one step. The other
shoe was all follows. Funny. I like it.
