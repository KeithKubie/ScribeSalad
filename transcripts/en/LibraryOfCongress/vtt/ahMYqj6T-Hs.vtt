00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.510
&gt;&gt; From The Library of
Congress, in Washington, D.C.

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:23.210
[ Silence ]

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:24.510
&gt;&gt; Roberta I.

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:25.810
Shaffer: Good afternoon.

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:29.660 position:56%
My name is Robert Shaffer and I
have the absolute pleasure and honor

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:33.350
of serving as the 24th
Law Librarian of Congress.

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:34.650
And I'm also delighted

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:40.660
to be convening this commemoration
today, of Constitution Day.

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:43.770
For those of you who are concerned
that something has happened

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.060
to your calendars or your
clocks on your iPhones,

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:52.860 position:56%
it is true that Constitution Day
normally would occur to mark the day

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:58.160
that the Constitutional Convention
ended in 1787 in Philadelphia.

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:01.880
And that would be the
17th of September.

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:06.430
But the 17th falls on a Saturday
this year, and so as such,

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:10.370
The Law Library of Congress,
which always takes responsibility

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:14.680
for celebrating the Constitution on
behalf of The Library of Congress,

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:18.410
has decided that we will
elongate the celebration,

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:22.610
because nobody can celebrate
the constitution too much.

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:24.700
But we're not going to
overdo it, I promise you.

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:28.950
So we're going to start today and
we're going to end the celebration

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:34.690
on September 26th at noon
in The Pickford Theater

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:36.300
where we will show a very,

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:41.770
very poignant documentary film
called Last Day of Freedom.

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:46.280
And a documentary film that I will
tell you about in a few minutes.

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:51.200 position:56%
But we will also be showing the
same film, Last Day of Freedom today

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.100
at two o'clock in The Law Library.

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.690
So if you cannot come back
on the 26th or if you would

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:00.950
like to see it today and
possibly see it again on the 26th,

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:04.350
you would be most welcomed
at any time.

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:11.670
So, Constitution Day, September
17th, has only been celebrated

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.260
since 2005, even though
the constitution has been

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.510
with us for a very long time.

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:23.670
The day actually started out
to commemorate Citizenship Day.

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:31.290
Initially, in the 1930s, the late
1930s, Citizenship Day was created

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:36.910
to honor new Americans and
William Randolph Hearst.

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:41.200
The newspaper magnet was very
instrumental in promoting it

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.170
through his newspaper chains.

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:50.960 position:56%
It was initially celebrated in May
and then in the 1950s it was changed

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:56.390 position:56%
to be celebrated on the day that the
Constitutional Convention finished,

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:57.690
September 17th.

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:04.700
And it wasn't until 2005
that Citizenship Day,

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:09.480
which was that original idea
that happened in the 1930s,

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:13.990
and Constitution Day,
celebrating the actual completion

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:16.820
of the Constitutional
Convention, were merged.

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:22.260
So that is the history
of Constitution Day.

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.960
When Constitution Day was
created in 2005, it was determined

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:30.250
that every federal
agency should find a way

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:34.710
to celebrate the Constitution, but
particularly that the Department

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:37.850
of Education should reach out

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:42.210
and help school children
understand the content

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:44.980 position:56%
and the meaning of the Constitution.

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:48.650
And as a result, little, mini
Constitutions were created.

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:52.680
And I have carried mine
with me for many years,

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:57.660 position:56%
so much so that it has lost its
cover, but I always have it with me.

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:01.120
And I keep it in a very non Library

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:06.660
of Congress preservation
casing, a sandwich bag.

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:10.260
So I hope my colleagues in the
preservation unit will not be upset

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:16.410
with me that my Constitution is
held in such high or low regard,

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:18.830
depending on your standards.

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:22.260
Now why is it that The Law
Library is so delighted

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.930
to celebrate the Constitution?

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:29.610
Well, of course, we are committed
to Constitutional ideals,

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:33.340
and the values of the rule of
law, which our own Constitution,

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:38.780
and the Constitution of nations
around the world, embodies.

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:44.530
Our offices are also in the
James Madison Memorial Building

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:45.830
across the street.

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:47.800
And as many of you know,

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:53.040
James Madison is called the
Father of the Constitution.

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:56.650
Not only because he was
so involved in the writing

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:00.470
of the actual Constitution,
and of the Bill of Rights,

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:04.250
but after the convention
was over, he was an advocate

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:07.250
for the ratification
of the document,

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:12.380
and he was very instrumental in the
states and the people therefore,

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:14.680
ratifying our Constitution

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:19.110
and giving us this
living, wonderful document.

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:23.140
We wanted to be in this room,
however, so that you could look

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:28.670 position:56%
through the blinds and see the
United States Supreme Court and have

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:33.100
that in your minds as
our program progressed.

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:36.100
Now today, we are taking a bit

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:40.570
of a different approach towards
celebrating Constitution Day.

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:45.150 position:56%
In a sense, we're focusing on the
8th amendment of the Bill of Rights,

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:52.780
which talks about not implementing
excessive fines or excessive bail,

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:57.770
but also addressed the issue of
cruel and unusual punishment.

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:02.340
In 2018, the Library
of Congress intends

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:08.020
to celebrate the 800th anniversary
of the Charter of the Forest.

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:10.550
That's a British document,
since you can well imagine,

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:14.000
since it's the 800th
anniversary, couldn't be part

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.870
of our legal tradition,
it's far too old.

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:21.940
But nonetheless, we believe
that the concept of cruel

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:27.090
and unusual punishment emanates
from the Charter of the Forest.

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:30.400
So we're giving you a
little bit of foreshadowing

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:35.900
about a very exciting year
that we will celebrate in 2018.

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:39.080
But today, we have a
very special guest,

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:43.470
and I know that you can read
his biography in the program,

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:47.870
but I also want to thank Dr. Robert
Maman for giving this talk today.

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:51.130
At the 11th hour, we
found it necessary

00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:56.610
to change our Constitution Day
celebration agenda, and he very,

00:06:56.610 --> 00:07:01.090
very graciously agreed to
step in and talk about a topic

00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:06.610
that is very near and dear to his
heart and that is mental illness.

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:10.850
Just this past Monday, there was
an editorial in The New York Times,

00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:17.500 position:56%
citing that the fact that 40 million
Americans, or 20% of our population,

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:21.630
suffers from some aspect
of mental illness.

00:07:21.630 --> 00:07:25.550
And Dr. Maman will talk to
us today about the confluence

00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:29.980
of the criminal justice
system and the mentally ill.

00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:33.870
So without further a due,
it's my honor and privilege

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:38.510
to turn the podium over
to Dr. Robert Maman.

00:07:38.510 --> 00:07:47.080
[ Applause ]

00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:51.090 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Robert Maman: Good afternoon.

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:57.940
I will talk about mental
health courts,

00:07:57.940 --> 00:08:05.380
which is rather new concept
dating from the 1990s.

00:08:06.390 --> 00:08:09.130
Mental health court
has been developed

00:08:09.130 --> 00:08:15.310
to create a special procedure where
mentally ill offenders charged

00:08:15.310 --> 00:08:18.950
with criminal activities
will be diverted

00:08:18.950 --> 00:08:27.460
from correctional facilities to
community mental health based care.

00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:32.200
Yes, thank you.

00:08:33.540 --> 00:08:41.150 position:56%
The shared goal of the mental health
court are to improve public safety

00:08:41.150 --> 00:08:48.690
by reducing criticism, improving
the quality of life of people

00:08:48.690 --> 00:08:54.980
with mental illness by
increasing their participation

00:08:54.980 --> 00:08:59.800
in effective treatment,
and reducing court

00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:03.720
and correctional related costs.

00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:08.700
This philosophical point
of view is not new,

00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:15.890 position:56%
as it follows several approaches
including crisis intervention teams,

00:09:15.890 --> 00:09:21.810
jail diversion programs,
specialized probation

00:09:21.810 --> 00:09:24.240
and parole caseloads developed

00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:31.070
to address the significant
over-representation of people

00:09:31.070 --> 00:09:34.990
with mental illness in the
criminal justice system.

00:09:34.990 --> 00:09:43.990
The estimate brings the percentage
inmates with serious mental illness

00:09:43.990 --> 00:09:52.900
to 20%, therefore triggering a
reading of the c'est la vie gamble

00:09:52.900 --> 00:09:58.350
of 1976 where the supreme
court determined

00:09:58.350 --> 00:10:03.960 position:56%
that the 8th amendment requires that
prison officials provide a system

00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:12.400
of adequate medical care
including mental health care.

00:10:13.590 --> 00:10:16.580
&gt;&gt; In another approach
to address crime

00:10:16.580 --> 00:10:23.120
in the United States is worth
considering as the US continues

00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:31.270 position:56%
to highest incarceration rate in
the world with 5% of the population,

00:10:31.270 --> 00:10:35.170
but nearly 25% of the
world's inmates.

00:10:35.170 --> 00:10:43.360
Looking at the history, it
seems that the recent shift

00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:49.370
in the correctional population
under incarceration started

00:10:49.370 --> 00:10:53.440
with the reduction in the
number of beds available

00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:57.870
in the states' [inaudible] network.

00:10:57.870 --> 00:11:04.490
The de-institutionalization
of people

00:11:04.490 --> 00:11:11.950
with severe mental illness began
in the mid 1950s around the time

00:11:11.950 --> 00:11:15.660
when the first important
anti-psychotic medication,

00:11:15.660 --> 00:11:20.790
named Thorazine, became
available in the United States.

00:11:20.790 --> 00:11:29.080
The de-institutionalization was
accelerated in the mid 1960s

00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:35.330
in connection with federal
incentives and court decisions.

00:11:35.330 --> 00:11:42.940
This process led to the
disappearance of more than 90%

00:11:42.940 --> 00:11:47.510
of the state psychiatric beds
for long term care in the US.

00:11:47.510 --> 00:11:55.970
The advocate of the
de-institutionalization believed

00:11:55.970 --> 00:12:00.360
that the closing of said hospitals
would encourage the mentally ill

00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:03.990
population to live
more independently

00:12:03.990 --> 00:12:08.900
in the community while
treatment will be provided

00:12:08.900 --> 00:12:12.580
by community health programs.

00:12:12.580 --> 00:12:17.160
Unfortunately, the federal
government did not provide

00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:21.380
sufficient funds for
community programs

00:12:21.380 --> 00:12:26.020
to meet the increased
demand for services,

00:12:26.020 --> 00:12:32.120
and the states were not able
to fill the financial gap.

00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:37.580
As a result of this lack of service
availability, hundreds of thousands

00:12:37.580 --> 00:12:39.860
of mentally released

00:12:39.860 --> 00:12:44.510
in the community did not
have access to treatment.

00:12:44.510 --> 00:12:50.340
These individuals were involved in
substance abuse and misdemeanors,

00:12:50.340 --> 00:12:54.800
and they ended up serving
time in our jails and prison,

00:12:54.800 --> 00:13:01.570 position:56%
with remarkable increased of the
mentally ill population behind bars.

00:13:01.570 --> 00:13:07.750
It is important to realize that
mentally ill individuals are known

00:13:07.750 --> 00:13:12.010
to be ostracized and
stigmatized by other inmates,

00:13:12.010 --> 00:13:15.790
adding to the suffering
related to their illness.

00:13:15.790 --> 00:13:25.980
And this additional awareness
certainly justifies mental health

00:13:25.980 --> 00:13:30.340
court existence, at least in part.

00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:34.550
The first experiment
took place in the 1980s,

00:13:34.550 --> 00:13:40.380
when Judge Evan D. Goodman
helped establish a court dealing

00:13:40.380 --> 00:13:45.980
with mentally ill offenders
at Wishard Memorial Hospital

00:13:45.980 --> 00:13:48.790
in Indianapolis, Indiana.

00:13:48.790 --> 00:13:55.510
In this first sitting, the
criminal charges were put on hold

00:13:55.510 --> 00:14:01.780
and the treatment providers sought
a civil commitment sending those

00:14:01.780 --> 00:14:06.010
patients to psychiatric treatment.

00:14:06.010 --> 00:14:11.690
Judge Goodman remained involved
by scheduling periodic hearings

00:14:11.690 --> 00:14:15.990
to follow the progress
of those patients.

00:14:15.990 --> 00:14:19.980
Eventually, the criminal
charges were dismissed,

00:14:19.980 --> 00:14:24.640
but the remained under
civil commitment.

00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:27.900
Those civil commitments
could have been received

00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:33.770
for inpatient treatment as
well as outpatient care.

00:14:33.770 --> 00:14:40.620
This experiment was eventually
dissolved in the 1980s,

00:14:40.620 --> 00:14:46.740
but fortunately, only a
few years later, in 1996,

00:14:46.740 --> 00:14:51.200
a number of various mental health
workers, who had been involved

00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:56.770
with Judge Goodman, started a
new mental health court program

00:14:56.770 --> 00:15:02.960
with the support of the local
authorities in Marion County,

00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:07.230
where this new program
was taking place.

00:15:07.230 --> 00:15:12.810
Shortly after this creation,
other programs were initiated

00:15:12.810 --> 00:15:20.030 position:56%
in Broward County, Florida,
overseen by Judge Lerner-Wren in 97.

00:15:20.030 --> 00:15:25.360 position:56%
And a couple of years later,
Anchorage, Alaska and San Bernadino,

00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:30.630
California had their
own mental health court.

00:15:30.630 --> 00:15:37.320
From four mental health courts in
1997, the number has grown to more

00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:41.550
than 300 at present, and
the number keeps growing.

00:15:41.550 --> 00:15:49.370
Looking at the making of
fashioning of mental health court,

00:15:49.370 --> 00:15:54.040 position:56%
I wanted to mention that in the fall
of last year, I was very fortunate

00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:57.880
to be invited to serve
as special adviser

00:15:57.880 --> 00:16:01.990
to the Montgomery County
Mental Health Court Planning

00:16:01.990 --> 00:16:05.060
and Implementation Task Force.

00:16:05.060 --> 00:16:10.320
Presenting a task force where
judges, defense attorneys,

00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:15.140
prosecutors, mental health
crisis service coordinators,

00:16:15.140 --> 00:16:18.300
rehabilitation service
administrators,

00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:22.720
local correction administrators,
family services,

00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:28.740
police and sheriff office
staff showing that the chair

00:16:28.740 --> 00:16:34.860 position:56%
of the task force, a gentleman named
Phil Andrews, had done his homework

00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:39.830
in putting together such a
comprehensive professional team.

00:16:39.830 --> 00:16:45.950
One of the most remarkable
features of the court is

00:16:45.950 --> 00:16:53.420
that they are closely connected
to the name of the local judge,

00:16:53.420 --> 00:16:59.130
as the main model of the
creation in most jurisdictions.

00:16:59.130 --> 00:17:02.760
In fact, it is essential
that the judge involved

00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:09.110
in each court remain the same
person in order for the court

00:17:09.110 --> 00:17:15.580
to develop a personal relationship
with the mentally ill offender.

00:17:15.580 --> 00:17:22.580
During the status hearings, the
judge that the participant knows,

00:17:22.580 --> 00:17:27.430
will have to develop a
relationship with this participant,

00:17:27.430 --> 00:17:35.480
to give a stronger meaning
to various rewards provided

00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:41.250
for adherence to the condition of
participation, but also sanctions

00:17:41.250 --> 00:17:47.470
for non-adherence in order to
ensure an ongoing interaction

00:17:47.470 --> 00:17:52.450
between participant and
the court team members.

00:17:52.450 --> 00:17:55.950
Essentially, the judge
accepted the role

00:17:55.950 --> 00:18:00.160
of becoming a social worker
involved in the treatment team,

00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:04.280
and that's a big step and the
judge has to express an interest,

00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:10.090
and the will and the courage to
be able to fulfill that role.

00:18:10.090 --> 00:18:16.430
In each jurisdiction, the court
has it's specific requirements,

00:18:16.430 --> 00:18:22.090
but most have at least four
common characteristics.

00:18:22.090 --> 00:18:27.820
The first one is that each
defendant will receive a customized

00:18:27.820 --> 00:18:35.740
rehabilitation and treatment plan
to address his or her situation.

00:18:35.740 --> 00:18:43.440 position:56%
Number two, the treatment plan will
be implemented by a [inaudible] team

00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:49.680 position:56%
of professionals, having legal,
correctional, and medical expertise.

00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:55.600
Number three, as I mentioned
earlier, regular status hearings,

00:18:55.600 --> 00:19:01.310 position:56%
at which treatment plans and other
conditions are periodically reviewed

00:19:01.310 --> 00:19:04.650
for appropriateness
will be scheduled

00:19:04.650 --> 00:19:09.090 position:56%
and those are the status hearings
where the judge role is so important

00:19:09.090 --> 00:19:13.770
in the relationship
with the participant.

00:19:13.770 --> 00:19:19.580
Number four, the criteria defining
the participant conditions have

00:19:19.580 --> 00:19:24.030 position:56%
to be provided and have to be clear.

00:19:24.030 --> 00:19:25.590
The participant offenders

00:19:25.590 --> 00:19:29.080
under consideration are
usually screened early

00:19:29.080 --> 00:19:33.480
in the criminal process.

00:19:35.210 --> 00:19:38.360
They can be referred to
the court's attention

00:19:38.360 --> 00:19:43.600
by pre-trial service
officers, social workers,

00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:48.750
public defender's office,
but also by jail officers

00:19:48.750 --> 00:19:54.250
and by their own family
as well as among others.

00:19:54.250 --> 00:19:57.340
The time between the
arrest and the placement

00:19:57.340 --> 00:20:00.810
in the court's jurisdiction,
is an important measure

00:20:00.810 --> 00:20:04.910
of the effectiveness
of the court mandate.

00:20:06.950 --> 00:20:13.930
&gt;&gt; Each court has to create the
list of criteria which will be used

00:20:13.930 --> 00:20:17.530
to select the offenders
likely to be considered

00:20:17.530 --> 00:20:22.210
and then those candidates will
be given a more comprehensive

00:20:22.210 --> 00:20:27.270
assessment to determine their
interest in participating

00:20:27.270 --> 00:20:34.170
in the program and to review
the specific mental illness

00:20:34.170 --> 00:20:36.980
that they present with as well

00:20:36.980 --> 00:20:40.530
as their individual
needs in the community.

00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:46.730
This initial acceptance
criteria will define which type

00:20:46.730 --> 00:20:53.300
of mental illness, crime committed
and criminal history are likely

00:20:53.300 --> 00:20:58.260
to be accepted by each court.

00:21:00.860 --> 00:21:07.120
Regarding mental illness, the trend
seems to be limited to suffering

00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:14.020
from what we call as mental heath
providers, serious mental illness,

00:21:14.020 --> 00:21:24.370 position:56%
which was categorized under axis one
pathology in the DSM classification.

00:21:24.370 --> 00:21:32.120
Those serious mental illness
diagnoses consists essentially

00:21:32.120 --> 00:21:38.290 position:56%
in schizophrenia, bipolar disorder,
major depression as well as anxiety.

00:21:38.290 --> 00:21:46.850
And it is important to make a
difference between this pathology

00:21:46.850 --> 00:21:53.920
and what was called axis two
pathology in the DSM full manual,

00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:58.930
which was referring to
personality disorders.

00:21:59.970 --> 00:22:10.740
The belief was that people this
major mental illness have less

00:22:10.740 --> 00:22:16.490
control, or even no control,
over their behavior and that

00:22:16.490 --> 00:22:22.110
in the position to the personality
disorder, patient [inaudible].

00:22:22.110 --> 00:22:27.230
But there are two remarks.

00:22:27.230 --> 00:22:33.730
The first one is that this
early distinction in control,

00:22:33.730 --> 00:22:37.700
or lack of such, depending
on the diagnosis given,

00:22:37.700 --> 00:22:44.120
this early distinction is now
challenged by recent findings

00:22:44.120 --> 00:22:52.100
where functional brain images are
showing some remarkable difference

00:22:52.100 --> 00:22:56.940
in the brain of the individual
suffering from personality disorder

00:22:56.940 --> 00:23:01.760
versus individuals
with no mental illness.

00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:04.010
So in light of such findings,

00:23:04.010 --> 00:23:08.040
the question of whether
those individuals

00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:12.040
with personality disorders
have control

00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:18.170
over their behavior provides
more and more cloudy answers,

00:23:18.170 --> 00:23:26.910
because the more scientific medical
data obtained shows the abnormality

00:23:26.910 --> 00:23:29.910
of the brain function.

00:23:29.910 --> 00:23:33.400
Another element which
is worth mentioning is

00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:39.590
that this very practical DSM
full classification of axis one

00:23:39.590 --> 00:23:50.690 position:56%
and axis two of personality disorder
is not removed because a new DSM,

00:23:50.690 --> 00:23:55.370
which stands for diagnostic
and statistical manual

00:23:55.370 --> 00:23:59.190
of mental disorder, this new
classification does not have those

00:23:59.190 --> 00:24:03.660
axis anymore, so the
realm of mental illness

00:24:03.660 --> 00:24:07.220
of becoming more cloudy,
at least to me.

00:24:07.220 --> 00:24:16.570
It is interesting to know that a
study of 2005 in Broward County,

00:24:16.570 --> 00:24:23.150 position:56%
Florida, found that the participants
in the mental health court,

00:24:23.150 --> 00:24:31.170 position:56%
carried a diagnosis of schizophrenia
in 17% of the case, major depression

00:24:31.170 --> 00:24:39.510
in 40% of the case, and bipolar
disorder in 24% of the cases.

00:24:39.510 --> 00:24:52.040
[ Silence ]

00:24:52.040 --> 00:24:55.940
&gt;&gt; Beside, after this number
one element of mental illness

00:24:55.940 --> 00:25:01.330
which should be considered,
the court looked at the type

00:25:01.330 --> 00:25:08.710
of relevant criminal activity which
would seem appropriate for them

00:25:08.710 --> 00:25:17.630
to accept in the participant
in the program.

00:25:17.630 --> 00:25:22.900
Most of the court started
by accepting misdemeanors

00:25:22.900 --> 00:25:28.460
and public nuisance crimes.

00:25:32.060 --> 00:25:38.630
Also, besides the court decision
of choosing which crime it wanted

00:25:38.630 --> 00:25:44.090
to address, there's also a
jurisdictional limitation

00:25:44.090 --> 00:25:48.010
of the court, could be
coming into question.

00:25:48.010 --> 00:25:50.950
For example, a court that operates

00:25:50.950 --> 00:25:55.900
within a municipal court will
have jurisdiction primarily

00:25:55.900 --> 00:25:57.320
over misdemeanor charges.

00:25:57.320 --> 00:26:00.880
So all those elements have to
be taken into consideration,

00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:05.430
and explain the differences
between each court function

00:26:05.430 --> 00:26:08.150
and criteria of functioning.

00:26:08.150 --> 00:26:13.350
Misdemeanor crimes
are the least likely

00:26:13.350 --> 00:26:18.500
to trigger a strong effective
response in the lay population,

00:26:18.500 --> 00:26:24.430
or even among the various workers
involved in the court system.

00:26:24.430 --> 00:26:29.150
On the other hand, crimes
of domestic violence

00:26:29.150 --> 00:26:34.880
or felonies would be more likely
to trigger anger and hatred

00:26:34.880 --> 00:26:37.190
in the mind of outsiders.

00:26:37.190 --> 00:26:43.150
And the laypeople would have
difficulties to accept the core,

00:26:43.150 --> 00:26:47.220
more therapeutic approach
as meaningful.

00:26:49.210 --> 00:26:52.470
Nevertheless, once the philosophy

00:26:52.470 --> 00:26:59.040
of the court concept has
been understood and accepted,

00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:03.570
one could very well
argue that violence,

00:27:03.570 --> 00:27:11.090
that once this basic concept is
accepted, one could very well argue

00:27:11.090 --> 00:27:12.810
for the incorporation

00:27:12.810 --> 00:27:17.520
of the felonies among the
accepted criminal activities.

00:27:17.520 --> 00:27:25.700
For example, people who
exercise violence to others,

00:27:25.700 --> 00:27:33.590 position:56%
such act could be part of the
mechanism of defense in the paranoia

00:27:33.590 --> 00:27:41.860
and therefore resulting
directly from the mental illness

00:27:41.860 --> 00:27:46.910
of paranoid delusions
with persecutory features.

00:27:46.910 --> 00:27:48.610
But that is an ongoing debate.

00:27:48.610 --> 00:27:55.660
It is interesting to note that
in the 2005 study of first

00:27:55.660 --> 00:27:59.250
and second generation court,

00:27:59.250 --> 00:28:04.190
four out of the six
first generation court

00:28:04.190 --> 00:28:11.100
which has been reviewed started
with accepting only misdemeanors

00:28:11.100 --> 00:28:16.780
and that those four out of the six
have been moving in the direction

00:28:16.780 --> 00:28:22.930
of accepting felony offenses
and a case by case basis.

00:28:22.930 --> 00:28:30.000
In the subsidy, the second
generation court, the seven of them

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:37.290
which were studied, all of
them showed an acceptance

00:28:37.290 --> 00:28:43.760
of felony charges for consideration
among their participants.

00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:50.310
After the mental illness
and the criminal behavior,

00:28:50.310 --> 00:28:53.950
the offender's criminal
history is also relevant

00:28:53.950 --> 00:28:58.050
in considering the
participant's acceptance.

00:28:58.050 --> 00:29:07.870
Multiple variations exist in
the acceptance criteria scheme.

00:29:07.870 --> 00:29:11.260
One of them is whether
the court believes

00:29:11.260 --> 00:29:15.640
that the causal relationship
must exist

00:29:15.640 --> 00:29:18.750
between the individual's mental
illness and the crime committed.

00:29:18.750 --> 00:29:22.650
And that is one of many issues

00:29:22.650 --> 00:29:29.290
where the team involved
must have the various legal

00:29:29.290 --> 00:29:33.000
and mental health professionals
come to an agreement

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:36.410
in the selection process.

00:29:36.410 --> 00:29:41.230
Ultimately, the judge has
the final say over the case,

00:29:41.230 --> 00:29:44.940
but the court team
approach is unique

00:29:44.940 --> 00:29:48.470 position:56%
and essential to the court function.

00:29:50.250 --> 00:29:52.940
&gt;&gt; A lot of difficulties remain.

00:29:52.940 --> 00:30:01.250
Two of them that I want to cite
here, the first one is that the

00:30:01.250 --> 00:30:06.010
after care is essential to
the success of the process.

00:30:06.010 --> 00:30:11.860
The court intervention and crime
prevention will not be effective

00:30:11.860 --> 00:30:17.760
short of providing the mentally ill
offender with some form of income,

00:30:17.760 --> 00:30:23.960
job training, program
activities or living arrangement.

00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:29.670
Also important, and I would say
essential, is the availability

00:30:29.670 --> 00:30:32.940
of public funds to
provide additional staff

00:30:32.940 --> 00:30:38.230
and provide training
for the staff involved.

00:30:38.230 --> 00:30:45.730
Also some criticism,
which has been voiced,

00:30:45.730 --> 00:30:52.710
some have criticized the court for
focusing on misdemeanor offenders

00:30:52.710 --> 00:30:59.020 position:56%
who would have received a shorter
sentence of jail or probation if not

00:30:59.020 --> 00:31:01.060
for the court involvement.

00:31:01.060 --> 00:31:08.690
So this is certainly
relevant to each case.

00:31:08.690 --> 00:31:12.960
Also, other critics raised
concerned over the possibility

00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:18.630
that court would coerce people
into treatment as well as the fact

00:31:18.630 --> 00:31:25.040
that some courts require the
defendant to enter a guilty plea

00:31:25.040 --> 00:31:29.350
in order to be considered
a candidate by the court.

00:31:29.350 --> 00:31:34.020
Also, the issue of
infringement and the privacy

00:31:34.020 --> 00:31:37.750
of treatment information is raised.

00:31:40.310 --> 00:31:45.230
Finally, among the one I am
quoting today, of concern,

00:31:45.230 --> 00:31:48.580
the fact that some ineffective
matter of community network,

00:31:48.580 --> 00:31:52.590
unable to absorb the
number of referrals

00:31:52.590 --> 00:31:55.760
from the court would
limit the benefits

00:31:55.760 --> 00:32:00.010
of the whole system
in that jurisdiction.

00:32:00.010 --> 00:32:13.130
In terms of the outcome, the first
discharge reviews have confirmed a

00:32:13.130 --> 00:32:23.430
reduced level of criminality
but recidivism still exists.

00:32:23.430 --> 00:32:35.470 position:56%
And each new case would have to be
reviewed and for the court to decide

00:32:35.470 --> 00:32:41.560
if the new crime committed by this
known offender qualified for return

00:32:41.560 --> 00:32:47.550
in the matter of court or for
more traditional handling.

00:32:49.880 --> 00:32:54.370
Some studies, although they didn't
provide me with specific numbers,

00:32:54.370 --> 00:33:02.840
showed in an urban evaluation
in two New York City courts,

00:33:02.840 --> 00:33:12.120
a significant reduction
of recidivism.

00:33:12.120 --> 00:33:19.000
In conclusion, the courts are part
of the new judicial philosophy,

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:22.510
where specialized courts have
shown a more comprehensive way

00:33:22.510 --> 00:33:29.470 position:56%
to develop justice, keeping in mind
the societal need for rehabilitation

00:33:29.470 --> 00:33:37.380
of the offenders, as domestic
violence courts or drug courts do.

00:33:37.380 --> 00:33:43.760
And finally, and I'm very happy
to raise this issue at the Library

00:33:43.760 --> 00:33:48.470
of Congress, because
that's an important element

00:33:48.470 --> 00:33:53.970
of this new concept, data
collection is essential

00:33:53.970 --> 00:33:58.620
in allowing the revision and
improvement in services delivered

00:33:58.620 --> 00:34:03.520
to the court, and support
justification of the investment

00:34:03.520 --> 00:34:07.460
of public funds in the system.

00:34:07.460 --> 00:34:09.510
Thank you for your patience.

00:34:09.510 --> 00:34:33.060

00:34:33.060 --> 00:34:35.830
&gt;&gt; Thanks very much for the talk.

00:34:35.830 --> 00:34:39.200
Now, I'm left wondering,
I know you said something

00:34:39.200 --> 00:34:45.110
about how participants in the
program are moved into the program,

00:34:45.110 --> 00:34:49.840
but I'm still left
wondering, my anticipation is

00:34:49.840 --> 00:34:53.110
that a defense attorney
will council against,

00:34:53.110 --> 00:34:58.980
even a public defender may council
a participant against participation

00:34:58.980 --> 00:35:02.780
in the mental health court, because
the sentences, well, treatment,

00:35:02.780 --> 00:35:04.930 position:56%
will be longer maybe than otherwise.

00:35:04.930 --> 00:35:10.320
And the clients themselves may
say well I don't really want

00:35:10.320 --> 00:35:12.220
to be in the system that long.

00:35:12.220 --> 00:35:19.370 position:56%
And so there must be, it sounds like
there are big due process issues

00:35:19.370 --> 00:35:22.280
that are hiding behind
that moment where we move

00:35:22.280 --> 00:35:25.260
from the traditional system
to the mental health court.

00:35:25.260 --> 00:35:26.560
Can you say more about that?

00:35:26.560 --> 00:35:27.970
&gt;&gt; Dr. Robert Maman: Yes,
that's a very good question

00:35:27.970 --> 00:35:33.190
and that is certainly one of
the issues which was raised

00:35:33.190 --> 00:35:37.390
when I was involved
in the task force.

00:35:37.390 --> 00:35:41.920
This was raised by the public
defenders understandably.

00:35:41.920 --> 00:35:47.140
But there's also the
philosophy, the acceptance,

00:35:47.140 --> 00:35:55.400 position:56%
that those individuals are
misbehaving with criminal activities

00:35:55.400 --> 00:36:00.920
of all types because they
don't receive sufficient matter

00:36:00.920 --> 00:36:02.340
of treatment.

00:36:02.340 --> 00:36:11.580
And you know, in the same way, that
we would not have any difficulty,

00:36:11.580 --> 00:36:14.450
any [inaudible] here, to
upset the fact that if we hear

00:36:14.450 --> 00:36:20.690
about the diabetic who is acting
out, we would all accept the idea

00:36:20.690 --> 00:36:25.840
that we better give him a shot
of insulin, and unfortunately

00:36:25.840 --> 00:36:33.190 position:56%
if we need to rather than let him
be, a due freedom, independence more

00:36:33.190 --> 00:36:39.020
than you know, it's a bit fatherly
approach, but it can be certainly,

00:36:39.020 --> 00:36:44.860
it makes a lot of sense, in
terms of community philosophy.

00:36:44.860 --> 00:36:52.630
And that debate certainly
goes and voices are expressed

00:36:52.630 --> 00:36:59.820
from both sides of the aisle.

00:36:59.820 --> 00:37:01.120
Thank you.

00:37:01.120 --> 00:37:05.890
&gt;&gt; Dr. Maman, do we know about
what, is there a difference

00:37:05.890 --> 00:37:12.140
in the age group of these
criminal offenders that are being?

00:37:12.140 --> 00:37:17.510
&gt;&gt; Dr. Robert Maman: I did
not look into the specifics.

00:37:17.510 --> 00:37:20.740
It is a very interesting
point, but I was more looking

00:37:20.740 --> 00:37:23.820
at the global presentation,

00:37:23.820 --> 00:37:29.410
but I suspect that all age
groups would be involved

00:37:29.410 --> 00:37:35.870
because those are lifelong
illnesses and therefore misbehavior

00:37:35.870 --> 00:37:47.500
at any age would be possible if
not almost expected in big numbers.

00:37:47.500 --> 00:37:48.800
So that's my response.

00:37:48.800 --> 00:37:52.590
In terms of, in fact I'll
go back to the first part,

00:37:52.590 --> 00:38:00.020
I had an interesting [inaudible], I
was at the forensic annual meeting,

00:38:00.020 --> 00:38:07.750
and a group from England, I think,
presented a case where this father

00:38:07.750 --> 00:38:12.150
of three or two kids, you know,

00:38:12.150 --> 00:38:15.320
developed thoughts
of pedophilic nature.

00:38:15.320 --> 00:38:19.230
And I don't recall if he acted on
it, but there was some suspicion,

00:38:19.230 --> 00:38:27.160
and you know, eventually he was
charged, he received a sentence,

00:38:27.160 --> 00:38:33.300
but the sentence was
limited, let's say.

00:38:33.300 --> 00:38:37.890
The wife of course, left,
divorced, the kids were gone,

00:38:37.890 --> 00:38:40.610
and then he got a headache.

00:38:40.610 --> 00:38:45.810
And studies by neurologist
found a tumor in the brain,

00:38:45.810 --> 00:38:47.590
and they removed the tumor.

00:38:47.590 --> 00:38:51.410
And then he didn't have
any pedophilic thoughts

00:38:51.410 --> 00:38:52.870
and it cleared up.

00:38:52.870 --> 00:38:55.060
I don't know how the
process worked, but you know,

00:38:55.060 --> 00:38:57.050
nevertheless, he was released.

00:38:57.050 --> 00:38:59.590
The wife came back, the kids
came back, everything was nice.

00:38:59.590 --> 00:39:06.120
And then a few months later, or
years later, I forgot, this was six

00:39:06.120 --> 00:39:11.800 position:56%
or seven years ago at the
convention, he told his wife, honey,

00:39:11.800 --> 00:39:15.720
I have thoughts about those kids.

00:39:15.720 --> 00:39:18.900
And then he had another
study, and sure enough,

00:39:18.900 --> 00:39:22.360
he had the recidivism
of his brain tumor.

00:39:22.360 --> 00:39:28.770
So, and that's where the
question is of whether

00:39:28.770 --> 00:39:35.360
in that case it was accepted
that the behavior was related

00:39:35.360 --> 00:39:39.990
to an organic pathology,
therefore the control was null

00:39:39.990 --> 00:39:42.810
or nonexistent form the subject.

00:39:42.810 --> 00:39:52.370
Then the question is raised if,
do the other offenders suffering

00:39:52.370 --> 00:39:58.810
from mental illness have much
of a control on their behavior?

00:39:58.810 --> 00:40:05.960
But you know, it's such a murky
place, because although, you know,

00:40:05.960 --> 00:40:13.010
that raises a lot of questions and
the answers could be difficult,

00:40:13.010 --> 00:40:16.550
costly, and socially
difficult to accept.

00:40:16.550 --> 00:40:19.930
So that's a debate going on.

00:40:25.020 --> 00:40:27.980
&gt;&gt; I was intrigued by your
mentioning that there's a kind

00:40:27.980 --> 00:40:31.940
of an activism and almost
a social worker kind

00:40:31.940 --> 00:40:34.510
of an approach taken by the judge.

00:40:34.510 --> 00:40:37.540
And of course in the American
system, that's antithetical

00:40:37.540 --> 00:40:43.290
to how judges usually are
told to act, and actually act,

00:40:43.290 --> 00:40:46.330
there's supposed to be an aloofness
and a distance from the parties.

00:40:46.330 --> 00:40:49.180
And I'm wondering if
one thinks about that?

00:40:49.180 --> 00:40:54.590
Have these mental health
courts thought about mediation

00:40:54.590 --> 00:41:01.840
or using systems that are not
purely in the judicial name,

00:41:01.840 --> 00:41:06.020
because in a sense it sounds like
we're really asking our judges,

00:41:06.020 --> 00:41:09.690
forgive me for using your term
of art, to be schizophrenic,

00:41:09.690 --> 00:41:13.590
when they're in a traditional
court to be aloof and distant

00:41:13.590 --> 00:41:16.190
and not involved with the
parties and when they're sitting

00:41:16.190 --> 00:41:20.760
on the bench in a mental health
arena to be paternalistic

00:41:20.760 --> 00:41:23.180
or parental and all of that.

00:41:23.180 --> 00:41:26.560
I'm just wondering if some of the
programs have looked at mediation

00:41:26.560 --> 00:41:32.780
or an alternate way of
assigning potential participants?

00:41:32.780 --> 00:41:35.760
&gt;&gt; Dr. Robert Maman:
Well, the matter of court

00:41:35.760 --> 00:41:41.510
without choosing the term of
mediation, are doing that exactly.

00:41:41.510 --> 00:41:46.120
So that's why there's
a need for a consensus,

00:41:46.120 --> 00:41:49.150
an acceptance that
treatment is needed.

00:41:49.150 --> 00:41:54.400
So this mediation philosophy
is certainly put

00:41:54.400 --> 00:41:59.050
into direct application
in the matter of court

00:41:59.050 --> 00:42:06.160 position:56%
and that is the reason why the judge

00:42:06.160 --> 00:42:15.580
of the specific jurisdiction
must express interest in moving

00:42:15.580 --> 00:42:18.180
or carrying two or three
hats, some maybe more,

00:42:18.180 --> 00:42:22.000
to do get involved in those cases.

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:27.880 position:56%
And that certainly shows the
acceptance of the paternalistic view

00:42:27.880 --> 00:42:34.540
that treatment will be more
beneficial than just punishment

00:42:34.540 --> 00:42:45.080
and leaving these individuals
to their own choices.

00:42:45.080 --> 00:42:55.390
And being in the medical field,
I am not offended by the concept,

00:42:55.390 --> 00:43:03.490
but I can understand the legal
minds can have some difficulties.

00:43:03.490 --> 00:43:10.150

How are the HIPPA protections,
HIPPA laws?

If the court record
is public record,

00:43:23.060 --> 00:43:29.510
how are the HIPPA protections
secured for these participants?

00:43:29.510 --> 00:43:33.110
&gt;&gt; Dr. Robert Maman: I
do not have the answer,

00:43:33.110 --> 00:43:39.610
but certainly the question,
the issue has been raised

00:43:39.610 --> 00:43:47.160
and is relevant to be looked
at, and unfortunately,

00:43:47.160 --> 00:43:54.880
I didn't go on that side of the
problem, but that's one of many

00:43:54.880 --> 00:44:00.740 position:56%
of which have to be, you know,
cooked into this rather new process.

00:44:00.740 --> 00:44:05.250
We talk about less than,
barely more than 20 years.

00:44:05.250 --> 00:44:10.540
But that's also a major element
which has to be looked at

00:44:10.540 --> 00:44:13.960
and taken into consideration.

00:44:17.120 --> 00:44:18.480

[ Background Noise ]

00:44:32.040 --> 00:44:35.910
&gt;&gt; Hello. So we've talked a little
bit about the rights of someone

00:44:35.910 --> 00:44:40.590
with a mental illness as either
an unusual or cruel punishment,

00:44:40.590 --> 00:44:43.720
but are there any other
rights for people as,

00:44:43.720 --> 00:44:48.280
people who have a mental illness
but got classified as a disability

00:44:48.280 --> 00:44:49.790
that you've considered,
or you've looked at,

00:44:49.790 --> 00:44:51.990
or you've had to work
with specifically?

00:44:51.990 --> 00:44:54.930
&gt;&gt; Dr. Robert Maman: I'm
sorry, I didn't hear that.

00:44:54.930 --> 00:44:56.230
&gt;&gt; Oh, sure.

00:44:56.230 --> 00:45:03.900
So we talked a little bit about, so
the ethics behind ruling on someone

00:45:03.900 --> 00:45:06.310
with a mental illness,
but have you talked about

00:45:06.310 --> 00:45:12.500
or researched a mental illness as a
disability and looked at the ethics

00:45:12.500 --> 00:45:15.020
and constitutionality behind that?

00:45:15.020 --> 00:45:18.430
So looking at mental
illness as a disability.

00:45:18.430 --> 00:45:20.700
&gt;&gt; Dr. Robert Maman: We
are, my understanding,

00:45:20.700 --> 00:45:23.560
is that the disability resulting

00:45:23.560 --> 00:45:30.780
from mental illness does
not make you incompetent

00:45:30.780 --> 00:45:33.530
in the eyes of the court.

00:45:33.530 --> 00:45:38.680
So if you're competent
of your behavior,

00:45:38.680 --> 00:45:48.660
regardless of your disability,
then you are a defendant who has

00:45:48.660 --> 00:45:53.570
to face the charges
filed against you.

00:45:53.570 --> 00:46:02.620
So I think the disability would
be irrelevant after the resolution

00:46:02.620 --> 00:46:09.230
of the legal question and
that's how I understand it.

00:46:09.230 --> 00:46:20.510
Now, when disabilities, of which
there is a level of incompetence,

00:46:20.510 --> 00:46:23.310
then the traditional
court have handled

00:46:23.310 --> 00:46:27.860
that with a defendant attorney
pleading NCR and the patient going

00:46:27.860 --> 00:46:32.990
for a forensic evaluation as
to ability to withstand trial,

00:46:32.990 --> 00:46:38.240
or competency to, or responsibility
of the criminal behavior.

00:46:38.240 --> 00:46:44.520
So those elements, those avenues
are already in the system.

00:46:44.520 --> 00:46:49.840
So that's just an additional one
which doesn't go to the assessment

00:46:49.840 --> 00:46:55.510
to the incompetence as far as
incompetence standing, statutes.

explored at this time.

00:48:13.380 --> 00:48:18.970
of marrying Constitution Day
with Citizenship Day was in fact

00:48:18.970 --> 00:48:24.220
to make sure that every
citizen assumes his or her role

00:48:24.220 --> 00:48:27.690
in protecting the Constitution,
not just the court's,

00:48:27.690 --> 00:48:32.500
and certainly not just the highest
court which inspires us here today,

00:48:32.500 --> 00:48:36.770
but is not the only way that the
Constitution continues to live

00:48:36.770 --> 00:48:39.980 position:56%
and have relevance to everyday life.

00:48:39.980 --> 00:48:43.200 position:56%
Thank you so much for participating.

00:48:43.200 --> 00:48:45.660
We have some gifts for Dr. Maman.

00:48:45.660 --> 00:48:49.910
Okay. Both of these?

00:48:49.910 --> 00:48:54.510
So he's getting a gift as a lawyer
and a gift as a doctor, I suppose.

00:48:54.510 --> 00:48:58.510
[ Laughter ]

00:48:58.510 --> 00:49:02.980
[ Applause ]

00:49:02.980 --> 00:49:04.280
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:49:04.280 --> 00:49:05.580
&gt;&gt; Dr. Robert Maman: Thank you.

00:49:05.580 --> 00:49:06.880 position:56%
I will gladly come back if you want.

00:49:06.880 --> 00:49:08.180
&gt;&gt; Roberta I.

00:49:08.180 --> 00:49:11.310 position:56%
Shaffer: And please now join us for
a reception at the back of the room,

00:49:11.310 --> 00:49:17.160 position:56%
and if you are able, at two o'clock,
please join us in The Law Library

00:49:17.160 --> 00:49:21.260
which is the Madison
Building, room 201,

00:49:21.260 --> 00:49:24.210
for a showing of the
film Last Day of Freedom.

00:49:24.210 --> 00:49:29.550
I think it has enormous
relevance to a number of topics

00:49:29.550 --> 00:49:32.910
that were touched upon today and
it is in fact just a beautiful

00:49:32.910 --> 00:49:35.740
but difficult documentary.

00:49:35.740 --> 00:49:38.100
So thank you for being here today,

00:49:38.100 --> 00:49:42.190
go out and celebrate the
Constitution today and every day

00:49:42.190 --> 00:49:45.020
and please join us for the
reception at the back of the room.

00:49:45.020 --> 00:49:47.960
Thank you Dr. Maman.

00:49:47.960 --> 00:49:51.620
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of The Library of Congress.
