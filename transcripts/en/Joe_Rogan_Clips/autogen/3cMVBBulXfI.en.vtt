00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:43.490 align:start position:0%
institute this program I think there's a
 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:45.249 align:start position:0%
institute this program I think there's a
big<00:04:43.639><c> part</c><00:04:43.880><c> of</c><00:04:43.970><c> it</c><00:04:44.090><c> I</c><00:04:44.270><c> think</c><00:04:44.539><c> it's</c><00:04:44.840><c> a</c><00:04:44.900><c> big</c><00:04:45.050><c> part</c>

00:04:45.249 --> 00:04:45.259 align:start position:0%
big part of it I think it's a big part
 

00:04:45.259 --> 00:04:47.670 align:start position:0%
big part of it I think it's a big part
of<00:04:45.340><c> professional</c><00:04:46.340><c> sports</c><00:04:46.550><c> in</c><00:04:46.729><c> general</c><00:04:46.850><c> sure</c>

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:47.680 align:start position:0%
of professional sports in general sure
 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:52.540 align:start position:0%
of professional sports in general sure
yeah<00:04:48.680><c> and</c><00:04:48.979><c> I</c><00:04:49.460><c> think</c><00:04:49.729><c> that</c><00:04:49.940><c> um</c><00:04:50.180><c> you</c><00:04:50.990><c> know</c><00:04:51.550><c> combat</c>

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:52.550 align:start position:0%
yeah and I think that um you know combat
 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:55.180 align:start position:0%
yeah and I think that um you know combat
sports<00:04:52.880><c> you</c><00:04:53.210><c> know</c><00:04:53.360><c> has</c><00:04:53.930><c> a</c><00:04:54.190><c> government</c>

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:55.190 align:start position:0%
sports you know has a government
 

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:56.710 align:start position:0%
sports you know has a government
oversight<00:04:55.610><c> that</c><00:04:55.759><c> other</c><00:04:55.970><c> sports</c><00:04:56.270><c> don't</c><00:04:56.479><c> have</c>

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:56.720 align:start position:0%
oversight that other sports don't have
 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:58.990 align:start position:0%
oversight that other sports don't have
so<00:04:57.500><c> I</c><00:04:57.530><c> think</c><00:04:57.650><c> their</c><00:04:58.009><c> work</c><00:04:58.130><c> on</c><00:04:58.430><c> we're</c><00:04:58.820><c> gonna</c><00:04:58.910><c> be</c>

00:04:58.990 --> 00:04:59.000 align:start position:0%
so I think their work on we're gonna be
 

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.999 align:start position:0%
so I think their work on we're gonna be
it's<00:04:59.599><c> gonna</c><00:04:59.750><c> be</c><00:04:59.840><c> coming</c><00:05:00.229><c> up</c><00:05:00.380><c> regardless</c>

00:05:00.999 --> 00:05:01.009 align:start position:0%
it's gonna be coming up regardless
 

00:05:01.009 --> 00:05:02.560 align:start position:0%
it's gonna be coming up regardless
anyway<00:05:01.460><c> so</c><00:05:01.520><c> I</c><00:05:01.669><c> think</c><00:05:01.849><c> maybe</c><00:05:02.150><c> that's</c><00:05:02.330><c> whether</c>

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:02.570 align:start position:0%
anyway so I think maybe that's whether
 

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:04.719 align:start position:0%
anyway so I think maybe that's whether
you<00:05:02.720><c> know</c><00:05:03.080><c> the</c><00:05:03.410><c> UFC</c><00:05:03.710><c> took</c><00:05:03.889><c> a</c><00:05:03.919><c> position</c><00:05:04.370><c> right</c><00:05:04.550><c> I</c>

00:05:04.719 --> 00:05:04.729 align:start position:0%
you know the UFC took a position right I
 

00:05:04.729 --> 00:05:07.360 align:start position:0%
you know the UFC took a position right I
think<00:05:05.180><c> of</c><00:05:05.360><c> the</c><00:05:05.419><c> other</c><00:05:05.570><c> sports</c><00:05:05.870><c> I</c><00:05:06.110><c> mean</c><00:05:06.830><c> guys</c>

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:07.370 align:start position:0%
think of the other sports I mean guys
 

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:08.980 align:start position:0%
think of the other sports I mean guys
get<00:05:07.669><c> caught</c><00:05:07.880><c> doing</c><00:05:08.090><c> things</c><00:05:08.360><c> but</c><00:05:08.539><c> a</c><00:05:08.599><c> lot</c><00:05:08.840><c> of</c><00:05:08.870><c> the</c>

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:08.990 align:start position:0%
get caught doing things but a lot of the
 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:10.420 align:start position:0%
get caught doing things but a lot of the
other<00:05:09.139><c> sports</c><00:05:09.320><c> regulate</c><00:05:09.800><c> themselves</c><00:05:10.009><c> right</c>

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:10.430 align:start position:0%
other sports regulate themselves right
 

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:13.360 align:start position:0%
other sports regulate themselves right
mm-hmm<00:05:11.180><c> yeah</c><00:05:11.750><c> I</c><00:05:11.780><c> don't</c><00:05:12.349><c> know</c><00:05:12.590><c> I</c><00:05:12.620><c> think</c><00:05:12.830><c> the</c><00:05:13.130><c> NFL</c>

go the next day what do you think the
 

00:09:25.129 --> 00:09:27.670 align:start position:0%
go the next day what do you think the

00:09:27.670 --> 00:09:27.680 align:start position:0%
answer is because like for me like this

is<00:09:27.829><c> all</c><00:09:27.980><c> stuff</c><00:09:28.339><c> that</c><00:09:28.399><c> like</c><00:09:28.670><c> to</c><00:09:28.970><c> be</c><00:09:29.089><c> honest</c><00:09:29.420><c> I</c>

00:09:29.619 --> 00:09:29.629 align:start position:0%
is all stuff that like to be honest I

00:09:34.179 --> 00:09:34.189 align:start position:0%
it because I don't have I also
 

00:09:34.189 --> 00:09:36.249 align:start position:0%
it because I don't have I also
it's<00:09:34.399><c> out</c><00:09:34.550><c> of</c><00:09:34.610><c> my</c><00:09:34.730><c> wheelhouse</c><00:09:35.569><c> to</c><00:09:35.899><c> deal</c><00:09:36.079><c> with</c>
