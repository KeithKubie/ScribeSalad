00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.410
When you see like,
um,
like some of their,
uh,
like free bird,

2
00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:07.320
that free bird solo that gets taught,

3
00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:09.660
which is one of the greatest solos in the history of all music.

4
00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:12.240
There's some specific reasons for this.
Okay.

5
00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.210
One of the more specific reasons is you had to built,

6
00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.020
it has a beginning,
a middle,

7
00:00:19.021 --> 00:00:23.100
a crescendo and end their specific names to this.
Okay.

8
00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:24.483
Um,

9
00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.100
when we moved to more channels in recording,
when know Leonard Skinner,

10
00:00:30.101 --> 00:00:33.780
he recorded all their early stuff has eight track and then you had to double up

11
00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:38.420
or early Van Halen.
Same thing.
You had to compile your tracks or whatever.
I'm,

12
00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.330
you had to really walk in with your solo written okay.

13
00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.360
And play and you would work it until it really had a thing in crescendos.

14
00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:50.670
Yeah.
Okay.
Once there were many tracks,

15
00:00:50.671 --> 00:00:55.260
guys would come in and just wing it and go,
okay,
let's try one.
[inaudible]
okay,

16
00:00:55.261 --> 00:00:58.170
great.
That's fine.
Let's do it again.
Track too.

17
00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:00.870
And they just make it up as they go.
Okay.

18
00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.600
And then when it's time to mix,

19
00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.890
they'll put a little of track two and a little subtract six and start moving

20
00:01:07.891 --> 00:01:12.891
those channels in a way that you would never think to play the guitar.

21
00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.390
For example,
ed started doing that on a couple of tracks,
right?

22
00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:23.100
Original Solos running with the devil.
Did it,
did it,
did it,
did it in.
Okay.

23
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.250
These are thematic solos.
Most Beatles Solos,

24
00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:31.430
the matic you follow and listen to the solo in ain't talking [inaudible] these

25
00:01:33.481 --> 00:01:38.160
are thematic solos.
When it started going,
whether they like this,

26
00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.510
he'd record six different versions of the souls.
Okay.

27
00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:46.170
And then just started move the channel like here,
turn this one on,

28
00:01:46.171 --> 00:01:51.060
turn this one off,
turn this 100 and then he'd have to go learn the solo.
Wow.

29
00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.120
So he will see his hand move from down here to up here and down there.

30
00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.850
It became a gymnastic effort,

31
00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:05.180
more elbow and shoulder to get his hand from the far end of the fret board all

32
00:02:07.081 --> 00:02:12.081
the way up to the pickup and back to duplicate that,

33
00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:17.910
uh,
Wabisabi.
Wow approach to making solos.

34
00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:23.150
So it was a very oblique or unique kind of way of creating a solo.

35
00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:27.270
It was utilizing the digital,
digital future,

36
00:02:27.271 --> 00:02:31.890
multi tracking and improvising and fall as opposed to,

37
00:02:31.891 --> 00:02:34.950
I'm going to sit down and I'm going to just,

38
00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:38.280
I'm going to create something like a book.
Here's the beginning,

39
00:02:38.281 --> 00:02:42.840
here's the scene here.
The character's,
here's the conflict.
Instead,
it's,

40
00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:46.020
let's just mix that all up together in interesting ways.
