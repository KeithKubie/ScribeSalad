Ian: Hi I'm Ian Bremmer, president of Eurasia
group here at the World Economic forum in

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:10.760
Davos
I think 2008 is the year when the United States

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:16.939
is going to be increasingly challenged in
terms of the insecurity that its people feel

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:21.920
about to what extent the trajectory the world
is heading is the one that is beneficial to

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:25.070
the United States.
So I think if there's one thing that the world

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:31.630
can do together, it is both to help Americans
understand that globalization is -- supporting

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:36.300
globalization -- a leadership role in globalization
is something that continues to be important

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.540
for the world.
And also that the world, that other states,

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:46.059
that emerging markets need to cooperate constructively
with the United States in that fashion.

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:53.469
I think never in the course of a globalized
world has the direction of leadership been

00:00:53.469 --> 00:00:58.400
so challenged as in 2008.
The confluence of the economic challenges

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:02.899
that are presently being faced with Beijing
Olympics and with an American presidential

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:06.020
election coming in November is unfortunate
in many ways,

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:11.350
and challenges a lot of the values that are
shared by the members of the World Economic

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:16.930
forum in Davos.
I think those values need to be spoken loudly

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:20.220
and particularly this year.
So I think if there is anything that folks

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.790
in the world can do, it's to support that.
Thank you very much.
