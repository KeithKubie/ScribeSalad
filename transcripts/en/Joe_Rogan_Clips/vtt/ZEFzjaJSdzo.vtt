1
00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:02.910
The other thing they say is that as people get more affluent,

2
00:00:02.911 --> 00:00:06.750
they have less children than the population decreases as the world's economy

3
00:00:06.751 --> 00:00:07.584
evens out.

4
00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.400
And so that we reached like a point where we can maintain a sustainable

5
00:00:11.401 --> 00:00:12.234
population.

6
00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.620
How does that still happen without mass genocide or mass sterilization?

7
00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.190
That's a good question.
I don't think they're saying that.

8
00:00:18.191 --> 00:00:22.290
And I think what they're saying is that as people become more educated and more

9
00:00:22.291 --> 00:00:26.550
affluent and more successful,
as more urbanization takes place,

10
00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.960
people work more and have less children and when they have less children,

11
00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:33.180
the population actually slightly decreases.
This is,
I've heard this argument,

12
00:00:33.181 --> 00:00:38.181
but I don't mind the way fuck more people who fuck more have more children now

13
00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:41.640
that,
that just,
I like,
that's one of those stats where I'd be like,
that might do,

14
00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:44.700
they might just be talking about a particular class of people.

15
00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.040
They're still selling 7 billion people.
Yeah.

16
00:00:47.041 --> 00:00:51.070
There's still 7 billion people live mostly for under 22,000 a year.
Yeah.

17
00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:55.680
And it usually,
every time development comes at exploits them.
Yes.

18
00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.470
So like where does the balance out of influence coming?

19
00:00:58.471 --> 00:01:02.490
Like I know there's one country now that's doing a universal pay for people,

20
00:01:02.491 --> 00:01:04.390
so are we going to talk about point?

21
00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.710
Because when you go to like is does that happen?
Is that,
is that it?

22
00:01:07.711 --> 00:01:09.120
We going to universal pay?
Well,

23
00:01:09.121 --> 00:01:12.290
universal pay would be fine if it was universal effort.
If everybody did it,

24
00:01:12.291 --> 00:01:13.410
put it out the same amount of effort.

25
00:01:13.411 --> 00:01:14.810
I would agree with everyone getting to say no.

26
00:01:14.811 --> 00:01:17.910
I'm not saying I'm for or against that.
I'm just saying how do you maintain,

27
00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:20.760
how does it,
how does it happen that everybody,

28
00:01:20.761 --> 00:01:24.540
all of a sudden it's affluent without mass genocide of sterilization?

29
00:01:24.541 --> 00:01:28.200
I think the idea is that as urban and listen,
this is not my theory for sure,

30
00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:28.860
but I've read it.

31
00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.690
The idea is as the world becomes more urbanized and more educated and more

32
00:01:33.691 --> 00:01:36.060
wealthy as as city spread out,

33
00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:40.500
what happens is less of those people have kids and they have less kids.

34
00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:44.700
This is just a a,
that doesn't work.
I don't know if it works or not,

35
00:01:44.701 --> 00:01:47.670
but I know that this is an actual study.
Right.
See if he could find that.

36
00:01:47.671 --> 00:01:51.450
He pulled her vein is fuck,
some people are,
yeah,
most people are.

37
00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:55.140
But the overall humans,
once people have serious careers,

38
00:01:55.141 --> 00:01:56.880
like the man and the woman have a serious career,
they,

39
00:01:56.881 --> 00:01:58.500
both of them are like really invested in their career.

40
00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:00.330
They generally tend to have less kids.

41
00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.650
And when this is the idea is that as this people,
I don't know,
it's a solution.

42
00:02:04.651 --> 00:02:07.530
I don't think it's a good solution.
It may become obsessed with work.

43
00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.140
That's one of the things where the rest of the world is just not,

44
00:02:10.141 --> 00:02:12.060
that sounds like I'm still talking about America.

45
00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.360
Like poor people are fucking man.
So again,

46
00:02:15.361 --> 00:02:17.910
I just goes back to me like I hear those studies show,

47
00:02:17.911 --> 00:02:19.900
but you gotta say to yourself,
how do,

48
00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:24.240
how do you handle the other 4 billion people?
I think the argument is,

49
00:02:24.241 --> 00:02:26.850
and this is not my argument,
where do they go?
They keep,

50
00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.660
they keep expanding is that these cities and these urban areas,
uh,

51
00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:35.100
that as the society sort of evens out globally,

52
00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.230
whether it takes a thousand years or a hundred years,

53
00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:42.270
as things start to even out,
people will be more like Los Angeles and less,

54
00:02:42.271 --> 00:02:46.980
less,
less like poor place at Calcutta.
Yeah.
But that's site.
But what I'm saying,

55
00:02:46.981 --> 00:02:50.940
it's like poor places of cow cutter.
You've got a bunch of people walking.

56
00:02:50.941 --> 00:02:53.960
It's pumped in this noise.
It could be,
but Los Angeles you've got smaller,

57
00:02:53.961 --> 00:02:56.580
you got traffic,
got stretched really thin.
I'm like there's,
there's,

58
00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:58.920
those are two different extremes that that just seemed weird.

59
00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.420
Like I'm just saying,
you know,

60
00:03:01.421 --> 00:03:04.660
sometimes I just feel like maybe we're at the point it ain't no turning around

61
00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:08.230
then we might be.
Yeah.
Just cause we got 7 billion people.
We might be,

62
00:03:08.231 --> 00:03:09.520
but we also might not be.

63
00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:12.610
And I think it's not a bad time to be optimistic because as people look for

64
00:03:12.611 --> 00:03:16.000
better and better solutions.
Yeah,
yeah.
But,

65
00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:21.420
but like jock fresco and the Venus project talks about moneyless society,

66
00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:26.170
the rather radical change of what a political states and things of that nature

67
00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:28.990
Chompsky talks about,
you know,

68
00:03:28.991 --> 00:03:32.950
essentially all all countries essentially now,
no matter western or eastern,

69
00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:37.930
all the Archies and shit.
So like what's the radical departure from this?

70
00:03:37.931 --> 00:03:40.660
Then that saves it all in your mind.
Like where's the Joe Rogan,

71
00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:42.510
United Nations speech?

72
00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:46.120
Reagan was more aware of the flaws of the system than they ever have been any

73
00:03:46.121 --> 00:03:47.450
generation previous.
Okay.

74
00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:50.560
I think when you look at kids from the seventies and eighties I don't think

75
00:03:50.561 --> 00:03:55.240
there were nearly as educated as to how truly fucked up this country is at,

76
00:03:55.241 --> 00:03:59.530
but also yet truly amazing in terms of like the history of the world,

77
00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:04.210
but has plenty to printing to improve on.
But probably will.

78
00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:07.630
I think people are getting better at life to getting better at all,

79
00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:10.090
all of the things and government will come along with it.

80
00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:12.490
I think we're going to get better at things.
We understand each other better.

81
00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:17.550
We communicate better is I'm optimistic and I think with all these incredibly

82
00:04:18.431 --> 00:04:20.770
intelligent people that are looking at the problems in the world,

83
00:04:20.771 --> 00:04:24.310
in terms of carbon,
in the atmosphere or pollution in the ocean,

84
00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:27.580
people are already starting to work on solutions.
I got,

85
00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:30.640
I'm really optimistic that,
that it's,

86
00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:34.630
there's at least the potential for someone to figure out some solutions to some

87
00:04:34.631 --> 00:04:35.170
of these problems.

88
00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:39.880
Overpopulation is always going to be a weird one because you don't have the

89
00:04:39.881 --> 00:04:42.900
right to tell people how many kids they can have,
eh?
Cause who,

90
00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:46.150
like if you meet somebody who's got 10 kids and the most fucking amazing family

91
00:04:46.151 --> 00:04:49.390
ever,
what,
what,
what are you gonna say?
It's bad.

92
00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:53.140
They have 10 amazing kids.
Everybody's great.
You go over the house,
it's all love.

93
00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:57.010
Yeah.
What the fuck?
Why is that bad?
You tell it so,
so people are good,

94
00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:00.520
but only a certain amount.
Yeah,
exactly.
That's where it gets weird.
But,

95
00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:04.780
but it's not a cut and dry issue.
It's not a one or a zero.
It's like,
yeah,

96
00:05:04.781 --> 00:05:07.300
there are too many people and yeah,
you probably shouldn't have 10 kids,

97
00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:10.600
but you've got to fucking awesome family,
so,
hey,
have a good night,
man.

98
00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:14.960
What the fuck to do?
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
You know,
you know,

99
00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:19.450
just speaking as you know,
just that's a lot of the brown people.

100
00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:24.010
This just scenario,
this never worked well for us,
so I'm always,
always,

101
00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:25.690
always check it out.
