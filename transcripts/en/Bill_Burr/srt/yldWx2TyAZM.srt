1
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:01,700
Okay.

2
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:04,250
Hey, what's going on? It's bill burn.

3
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:07,310
It's time for the Monday
morning podcast for my day.

4
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:12,510
April 22nd, 2019 what's going on? How, ah,

5
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:16,030
yeah, right now you're probably
wondering what is with his tone.

6
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:19,770
He sounds happy and I, and
you know what you're like, oh,

7
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:23,120
what did the Bruins when yesterday,
what happened? I don't know.

8
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:24,660
Yeah.

9
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:27,680
All right.
Cause right now I'm watching live,

10
00:00:27,681 --> 00:00:32,270
I'm watching the Bruins Toronto with
1445 to go in the second period.

11
00:00:32,510 --> 00:00:35,480
Hey, come to pro and straighten up
the right style. Sorry. Can't y'all?

12
00:00:35,481 --> 00:00:36,320
My daughter's taking a nap.

13
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:38,633
MMM.

14
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:40,660
I don't know what happened with this game.

15
00:00:40,661 --> 00:00:44,200
It was just like Toronto came out like
fucking gang busters and I was like, Whoa,

16
00:00:44,201 --> 00:00:48,730
this is finally there year. You know,
they just a better God damn team.

17
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:49,750
But you know what?

18
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:55,550
The Bruins came back with a goal by Brad,
my Shan.

19
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:58,660
Oh No. Who's got the first one?
Tory crew got the first one,

20
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:03,330
then Marshawn got the one right off the
face off after Burgee one version where

21
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:07,830
I'm one one yet another face off.
So right now it's two to one. Um,

22
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:10,030
obviously the next goal is huge.

23
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:12,683
MMM.

24
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:16,770
I feel like whoever scores next
is going to win this fucking game.

25
00:01:16,771 --> 00:01:20,670
That's what I think.
That's my big bold prediction.

26
00:01:20,671 --> 00:01:22,530
So I got the game on in the background.

27
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:24,923
MMM.

28
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:28,540
This is like a fucking NBA game
where it's like, it's a game of runs.

29
00:01:29,410 --> 00:01:32,530
Cause like all of a sudden now,
now fucking Toronto can get the puck.

30
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:37,210
I'll tell you know, I'll never understand
this game of hockey, you know. Um,

31
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:42,510
anyways, I want to thank everybody that
came out to the F is for family, a um,

32
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:47,250
panel that we did on a Saturday.
Uh,

33
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:49,900
it was really cool, man. I
felt like the crowd was really,

34
00:01:49,901 --> 00:01:53,380
I had something happen after season
three where I think we finally pushed

35
00:01:53,381 --> 00:01:56,620
through to not being underground as much,

36
00:01:56,621 --> 00:02:00,000
where people are finally actually
watching the show. And uh, yeah,

37
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:02,500
it felt really proud.
It's sitting up there with Mike Price,

38
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:05,610
Vince Vaughn and Peter Billingsley.
Ah,

39
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:11,470
the fucking Mount Rushmore of the
show. Not Kidding. It said it takes a,

40
00:02:11,471 --> 00:02:16,090
it takes this city. But, uh, we had a
bunch of voiceover actors showed up. Uh,

41
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:20,290
Trevor Deval was there, Phil Henry,
Debbie dairy. Barry was there.

42
00:02:20,291 --> 00:02:24,340
Imagine there was a couple of others
that of course I'm going to forget. Um,

43
00:02:24,341 --> 00:02:27,970
I think mo Collins was there and
maybe Kevin, Michael Richardson.

44
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:33,560
Um, any Ho um, it was a,

45
00:02:33,561 --> 00:02:37,300
it was a great time and people set a
bunch of Nice things and what I was loving

46
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,720
as much as it was saying, oh my God,
the third season is your best season.

47
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:43,210
I actually think season four
is going to be even better.

48
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:47,920
And I'm thinking sometime
around season 11 or 12,

49
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:51,340
I think we might, I think we
might get nominated for something.

50
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:56,200
What are you going to do?
So anyway,

51
00:02:56,530 --> 00:03:00,880
I am sitting here on pins and needles
hoping my Boston Bruins are going to push

52
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:04,870
a, a force a game seven.
And if they don't,

53
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:07,810
I'm rooting for the leafs
and I've come to this new,

54
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:11,980
this new,
a place as a sports fan.

55
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:13,490
Okay.

56
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:17,960
Where I just realized all those years
I spent hating teams and Hayden,

57
00:03:17,961 --> 00:03:20,510
great players and then they go
when they retire. And I'm like,

58
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:24,350
wait a minute and I'm going to miss
this guy. This guy was great. Um,

59
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:27,440
I know your root against them because
they were on the other team. But, uh,

60
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:30,920
I dunno, it feels a lot better if you
lose to a team to be, hey, you know what?

61
00:03:30,921 --> 00:03:33,650
Good. Good for you. Good
luck to Ya. You know,

62
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:37,430
what the Fuck is Boston supposed to
win? Everything every year. I mean,

63
00:03:37,431 --> 00:03:42,250
how long can this run last? Um, no,

64
00:03:42,251 --> 00:03:44,160
I'm just, I'm gonna, I'm
gonna go into that mode.

65
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:49,190
This is all me getting read of
my ridiculous fucking anger.

66
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:52,350
I'll still have it.
I'll still have it for my comedy act.

67
00:03:52,351 --> 00:03:55,140
God knows I went up
last night and oh Jesus.

68
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:59,720
I went up down the Improv here on Melrose
and I went up at the laugh factory

69
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:03,900
down in Long Beach and
woo. Oh, stinker roof.

70
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:07,890
The new jokes,
just not just not working.

71
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:13,550
I'm kind of coming out with this really
fucking stupid one that I just ran by a

72
00:04:14,401 --> 00:04:18,360
bunch of jaded guys and they all told me
it was funny. And then like, you know,

73
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:23,160
women in like anybody who's
like remotely happy as a man,

74
00:04:23,161 --> 00:04:24,870
they just all staring at me like,
come on bill,

75
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:32,350
don't you think you're a little bit
better than that? Um, all right, well, um,

76
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:34,560
you know,
you saw that documentary free Solo.

77
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,720
That's what this podcast
is like right now.

78
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:41,790
Cause I don't have any advertising or
any fucking emails because my stupid

79
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:43,080
emails aren't loading.

80
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:47,220
And then I went on the Internet and God
bless this guy in a second language he

81
00:04:47,221 --> 00:04:49,930
was trying to tell me how to do is
I go to guard your part of Jerky,

82
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:52,590
bar their board and I couldn't
understand what the fuck he was saying.

83
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:57,360
And then he was on his phone and I slowed
it down and in large the thing so I

84
00:04:57,361 --> 00:05:02,250
could see what the hell that guy
was talking about. And uh, I dunno,

85
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:05,310
every fucking 10,
I Google shit every time I Google stuff,

86
00:05:05,311 --> 00:05:09,540
like whatever they're saying, it's
like, okay, click on the apple,

87
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:14,310
go to system preferences and then
click on a fucking, uh, I don't know,

88
00:05:14,311 --> 00:05:19,170
software update or whatever they say
and their shit. It's just Bam, Bam, Bam.

89
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:23,040
And mine is always like, Bam,
Bam, go fuck yourself. It's like,

90
00:05:23,041 --> 00:05:27,340
I don't have that. I mean,
I don't know what I need.

91
00:05:27,341 --> 00:05:30,490
I got to have like automatic
updates because I feel like
everybody's always like

92
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:36,410
two v two episodes ahead of me. Whatever
the hell it is you're supposed to say.

93
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:42,530
Um, so I don't have any fucking
emails. I asked Andrew to,

94
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:47,450
to send them via text. He
responded with sure. You know?

95
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:49,100
Sure. It's a very funny word. You know,

96
00:05:49,101 --> 00:05:51,890
it's one of those words that's like
positive and it's also very passive

97
00:05:51,891 --> 00:05:54,590
aggressive. Would you
mind doing that? Sure.

98
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:58,790
Or sheriff a lot of ways.
A lot of ways to read that.

99
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:04,670
Um, lovely knee is in the background.
Haven't been on the podcast in a while.

100
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:09,940
I know you're going to come
on. Yeah, I want a little
bit. Oh yeah. You get over it.

101
00:06:09,941 --> 00:06:11,950
You graceless get it out of there.

102
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:13,363
Yeah.

103
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:17,930
Yeah. Come the Bruins down the ice. A
possible two, one, one and we fuck it up,

104
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:20,863
Scott.

105
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:22,220
Yeah.

106
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:26,320
How the fuck did he score on that?
Sorry.

107
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:29,750
All of a sudden we slow down all my God.

108
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:33,020
Can I just turn on the TV and
listen to the fucking silence?

109
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:41,520
What happened? I don't know, but
he was anymore. I've got a kid.

110
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:45,740
The whole thing fell apart.
He just stopped. I think
he just flat out beat him.

111
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:50,830
Did he tip that in?

112
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:52,243
They made,

113
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:54,270
oh my God.

114
00:06:56,730 --> 00:07:00,000
Krag softest hands in the
NHL over at the brassy. Tip

115
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:06,970
three to one absolute deafening silence

116
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:10,550
up in Toronto.
We win this game.

117
00:07:10,551 --> 00:07:14,000
It doesn't mean shit because you have
to understand is a leaf fan okay?

118
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:17,600
Provided you didn't win today.
All right.

119
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:21,520
You know dead.
Even if you guys beat us,

120
00:07:21,521 --> 00:07:24,940
your team is going to torture you.
It's not gonna be easy.

121
00:07:24,941 --> 00:07:27,610
It was like the other day when you had
his fucking beat and then you let up that

122
00:07:27,611 --> 00:07:30,220
late goal. So you still
had to be like, fuck,

123
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,670
I'm all the Games are running
together for me. I don't know.

124
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:37,330
I just know you totally dominated us
in our own building and game five.

125
00:07:37,331 --> 00:07:41,750
And I was just like, well, maybe
this is finally the year. And, uh,

126
00:07:41,751 --> 00:07:44,600
the first 10 minutes of this game, I was
just like, they just the better team.

127
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:48,170
I feel like we're going six a, you
know, five against six out there

128
00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:53,040
fucking Bruins. I love
this team. I swear to God,

129
00:07:53,041 --> 00:07:56,400
I know the Celtics won four games
in a row, which is fucking awesome.

130
00:07:56,640 --> 00:08:01,210
I got to get on that bandwagon.
I just haven't, I just
don't have the time. But um,

131
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:06,400
I really, uh, I really am a
hockey fan over basketball.

132
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:11,940
Um, I just am Oh, Jesus. And
I stick to the fucking taint.

133
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:17,380
That'll be a penalty.
Right? It'll be a pet. Oh,

134
00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:19,810
Jesus. That's dangerous. Oh
yeah. Hate to see that. Good.

135
00:08:19,811 --> 00:08:23,180
He got his knees out
of the way. Um, anyway,

136
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,480
plowing ahead here.
Uh,

137
00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:30,830
so I'm getting ready to leave to go over
to Iceland middle part of this week and

138
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:35,610
uh, Amy, I want to talk to
you about my packing. Huh?

139
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:36,990
She's already given me shit.

140
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:38,080
Yeah,

141
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:41,350
she doesn't get it, man. She's
going to Iceland, but I'm,

142
00:08:41,410 --> 00:08:42,770
I'm starting an Iceland did,

143
00:08:42,771 --> 00:08:44,950
she's going to leave after that
and then I'm going on this.

144
00:08:44,951 --> 00:08:46,720
I don't even know where this
fucking toilet takes me.

145
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:50,410
I know I ended up in Israel, you know. Oh,

146
00:08:50,411 --> 00:08:55,000

149
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:08,200
Shows I'm going to
Copenhagen. Oh, I always had,

150
00:09:08,201 --> 00:09:09,580
I always tell me to take a Copenhagen.

151
00:09:09,581 --> 00:09:14,270
I think of that Conti fucking
taxi driver I had. All right,

152
00:09:14,271 --> 00:09:17,210
this is what I got. I'm in, uh, Reykjavik

153
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:24,020
Iceland on the 29th.
I'm in Copen Copenhagen on the 30th.

154
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,030
Both of those shows are sold out.

155
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:31,370
The second show in Copenhagen is
sold out denim in Stockholm, Sweden.

156
00:09:31,371 --> 00:09:31,860
Fuck.

157

158
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:45,640

shows in Helsinki on May 2nd, the, uh,

159
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:49,350
first show sold out.
The second one is not Oslow Norway.

160
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:54,150
This spectrum tickets still available.
Then I'm in Amsterdam, Netherlands.

161
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:56,760
Um,

162
00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:01,760
that's sold out and then I have a day
off and I'm so fucking tented to go to

163
00:10:01,921 --> 00:10:06,030
Spain and go to that moto GP race. I
just, I just not going to have that.

164
00:10:06,031 --> 00:10:08,760
That's the old me would have done that.

165
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,940
And then I'll go here for five minutes
and then I'll go there for five minutes.

166
00:10:11,941 --> 00:10:13,620
Or I could spend two days in Israel,

167
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,820
you know.
Oh my God.

168
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:21,410
Do you know what the name of the place
I'm playing in fucking Israel is Nia?

169
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:25,790
You know what? The name of the place I'm
playing in Israel is how great is this?

170
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:28,130
I'm playing this Shlomo Group arena,

171
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:35,660
uh, to be confused with
the [inaudible] funny bone.

172
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:39,450
What's the matter is they're
not like someone's name.

173
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:44,070
Shlomo yeah, yeah. That's what I mean.
Yeah, that's what I'm saying. Okay.

174
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:49,040
Why did you get all like that was like
some antisemitic shit cause I, you know,

175
00:10:49,210 --> 00:10:52,910
I thought you were making fun of the name.
I'm like, isn't it a Hebrew name? Yeah.

176
00:10:52,911 --> 00:10:54,500
So that's great. Oh, okay.

177
00:10:55,730 --> 00:11:00,730
We don't want to play a cousin
Vinnys fucking arena in Israel.

178
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:06,370
Shlomo Jesus were to take a fun traveling
moment and turn it into a Hashtag on

179
00:11:08,721 --> 00:11:11,810
Twitter.
He sounded excited,

180
00:11:11,811 --> 00:11:15,560
but was he really
antisemitic when we return,

181
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:20,420
another white person in their 20s
tries to destroy somebody else.

182
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:23,690
Odd fucking social media.

183
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:26,630
I've been having so much fun
fucking trash and all those cons.

184
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:31,520
Fucking young people out there just
trying to ruin people's lives for their

185
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:35,900
goddamned cause.
They fucking lunatics fucking lunatics.

186
00:11:35,901 --> 00:11:38,330
And like as I've sent somebody
takes a dick out at work.

187
00:11:38,331 --> 00:11:39,620
Obviously you got to say something,

188
00:11:39,830 --> 00:11:43,370
but this fucking ticky tack Shit and
you're going to sit there and try to twist

189
00:11:43,371 --> 00:11:46,820
it around like shit around.
Like you fucking Fox News and CNN.

190
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,000
It makes somebody look like an asshole.

191
00:11:49,010 --> 00:11:52,490
Just cause you don't like that political
opinion is it's fucking beyond me.

192
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:58,720
Um, anyways, I'll be at the Shlomo
group arena. That is fucking awesome.

193
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:01,213
MMM.

194
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:04,570
I should double up and
go do one in Palestine.

195
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:06,253
You know,

196
00:12:07,410 --> 00:12:11,570
little surf and turf over there. Get
both sides of the story, if you will.

197
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:13,710
MMM.

198
00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:16,170
Oh fuck.

200
00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:23,110
Clara in the zone. Will this be
icing? Don't ask Douggie Hamilton.

201
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:27,340
You don't know. Poor bastard. I
liked Douggie Hamilton, by the way.

202
00:12:27,341 --> 00:12:29,460
I don't know why I said that, but he
fucking, I don't know what happened here.

203
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:31,630
It was the other night I
was watching the caps game.

204
00:12:31,631 --> 00:12:34,690
It didn't matter cause they got the shit
kicked out of him but he like pointed

205
00:12:34,691 --> 00:12:38,830
like he called icing and the ref didn't
know bench can came in and took the Puck,

206
00:12:38,831 --> 00:12:41,650
pass it to his buddy. They're
right there. Fred Bing Bang, boom.

207
00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:44,283
MMM.

208
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:46,930
By the way, I didn't know Calgary
are the best record in the east.

209
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:49,300
I mean the West I would have devil
would have been exciting but then they

210
00:12:49,301 --> 00:12:52,990
fucking shit the bed just like Tampa.
Pittsburgh is out.

211
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:56,690
I'm going to show you that man.
That shit is fucking wide open here.

212
00:12:57,550 --> 00:12:58,970
I got to tell you right now,

213
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:03,050
if these Washington capitols could
get by the hurricanes. Carolina.

214
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:04,320
Okay.

215
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,700
They got a really good shot.

216
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:09,810
They got as good as shot as anybody to
go out there and when the cup and that

217
00:13:09,811 --> 00:13:14,730
would be a repeat for the first time
since the fucker Detroit Redwings is that

218
00:13:14,731 --> 00:13:17,940
right? First Time since 97 98 I
think that be the four already.

219
00:13:17,941 --> 00:13:20,010
The penguins doing.
Maybe the penguins didn't,

220
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:23,070
I think they did it a few years ago.
Um,

221
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:27,360
this will be the all Ho to guy
just did it out of the fucking air.

222
00:13:28,770 --> 00:13:32,460
Um, yeah. Come on on the podcast and talk
about your packing versus my packing.

223
00:13:36,010 --> 00:13:36,843
Yeah.

224
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:40,260
Yeah. At what point did you stop
giving a fuck about the podcast?

225
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:44,550
Or is it me? You used to always be
like, I love going on the podcast.

226
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:47,880
Then all of a sudden we have a kid and
you get other priorities since when does

227
00:13:47,881 --> 00:13:50,460
our kid come before the podcast?
Nia,

228
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:52,593
I'm asking you,

229
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:57,040
I love this commercial with
this guys in like a racing suit,

230
00:13:57,041 --> 00:14:00,700
like a fire retardant suit and he's
sitting there going, I love my job.

231
00:14:00,701 --> 00:14:03,700
And he's all excited because he's
driving a fucking Honda civic.

232
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:09,400
Rarely does that get your fucking balls
in an uproar there guys dressed like a

233
00:14:09,401 --> 00:14:13,420
race car driver and he's excited to drive
a fucking sophomore in college chick

234
00:14:13,421 --> 00:14:17,890
car if you've got money.
Right. Okay. Then after,

235
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:22,570
after Israel, the next show I have is, uh,

236
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:26,950
the Wilbur Theater in Boston,
Massachusetts for the, uh,
Travis. Roy Foundation.

237
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:32,110
And then after that I'm doing September
6th, the Cosmopolitan Hotel in Las Vegas.

238
00:14:32,111 --> 00:14:35,810
And I have to tell you people, uh,
over the summer, I will be, uh,

239
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:40,780
putting my act together in local comedy
clubs and I'll try to be giving you the

240
00:14:40,781 --> 00:14:42,460
heads up as I do that,
uh,

241
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:46,830
over the summer here
in loss on golf a visa.

242
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:50,560
Um, all right. Hey, let's read,

243
00:14:50,561 --> 00:14:52,910
let's read something that I actually
just found it an email that I could

244
00:14:52,911 --> 00:14:53,744
actually read.

245
00:14:55,410 --> 00:14:56,860
Um, oh, that ain't it.

246
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:01,010
That's notes for season five. If we
get it, that's how far ahead I am.

247
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:05,990
Notes on season five for F is for family.

248
00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:08,480
This guy from Australia sent me an email

249
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:14,340
and, um, let's see what we got here. Oh,

250
00:15:14,341 --> 00:15:19,290
and I somehow fucking deleted.
So fucking annoying, man.

251
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,193
There it is.

252
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:26,470
This fucking guy sent me something.
He said, good day, Billy. Red Nuts.

253
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:30,280
Love your podcast mate.
Uh, you crack me up.

254
00:15:30,281 --> 00:15:34,150
I'm also an older gentleman who has a
small child close to your daughter's age,

255
00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:38,050
so I love to hear how she's developing
as my lad is doing the same things.

256
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:42,040
It's great. I hope this is where
you get your emails for the podcast.

257
00:15:42,370 --> 00:15:45,940
Any who probably hasn't
made news over your way.

258
00:15:45,941 --> 00:15:50,860
But here in Australia there's been
considerable problems with militant vegans

259
00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:56,530
invading private farms.
They're really pissing people off.

260
00:15:56,531 --> 00:16:01,210
What has happened to the left? Maddie's
fit going fucking crazy. I kinda like it,

261
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:04,850
you know? Um, yeah,

262
00:16:05,650 --> 00:16:10,000
so they got militant vegans,
Jesus Christ.

263
00:16:10,001 --> 00:16:12,490
How much is Australia changed?
You know,

264
00:16:12,491 --> 00:16:15,730
they used to have a crazy guy wrassling
alligators down there and now all of a

265
00:16:15,731 --> 00:16:20,110
sudden they got people fucking
going nuts about kumquats. Um,

266
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:26,470
anyways, it really pissing people off. A
friend came to me the other day and said,

267
00:16:26,530 --> 00:16:30,610
how do you know if someone's a Vegan? I
said, I don't know. He said, don't worry.

268
00:16:30,611 --> 00:16:34,900
They'll fucking tell you. Ha it
cracked me up. Keep it up, mate.

269
00:16:34,901 --> 00:16:38,800
You should head down to Adelaide,
South Australia sometime.

270
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:43,450
Get stuffed your mug.
The fuck does get stuffed.

271
00:16:43,451 --> 00:16:47,350
Me can only imagine that some sort
of fucking take a dick in your ass.

272
00:16:49,130 --> 00:16:49,963
MMM.

273
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:52,741
I've got to tell you right now,

274
00:16:52,741 --> 00:16:56,130
I'm watching this fucking game and what
the fucking Bruins are doing right now.

275
00:16:56,131 --> 00:16:59,270
If these maple leafs of Toronto don't
wake up this fucking game, it's,

276
00:16:59,271 --> 00:17:01,680
it's over with six minutes
left in the second period.

277
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:07,770
I said it before, the next goal is going
to win. Although the way hockey is,

278
00:17:09,590 --> 00:17:14,000
I'll say the next goal, we go up four
to one. I will be feeling good, but if

279
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:18,350
Austin Matthews gets another one,
he had caught fucking great is that guy,

280
00:17:18,351 --> 00:17:19,850
they already showed them
the beginning of the game.

281
00:17:19,851 --> 00:17:24,850
They showed them skating slow motion.
Like when they had the maple leafs in uh,

282
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:28,840
emblem on the ice and he that,

283
00:17:28,841 --> 00:17:32,930
that 34 Jersey is already
Iraq. Uh, ironic, iconic.

284
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:36,680
I'm looking at that thing like this guy
is, he's going to be a hall of Famer.

285
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:38,810
I mean, that's not too
hard to guess. You know,

286
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:42,020
considering we scored four
goals in his first fucking game.

287
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:44,793
MMM.

288
00:17:45,010 --> 00:17:49,180
Bruins. Just down the maple leafs
and the entire second period,

289
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:53,430
at least the point that I've been looking
at. All right? So militant vegans, Nia,

290
00:17:53,431 --> 00:17:58,140
militant vegans are going fucking
nuts over there in Australia.

291
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:02,040
I guess they're marching onto farms.
Here's the thing about militant vegans.

292
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:05,280
All right? You might think
they're assholes, but I gotta
be honest with you there,

293
00:18:05,281 --> 00:18:09,760
right? The way we treat animals, a,

294
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:12,990
I'm all for killing them and eating them,
but this shit,

295
00:18:12,991 --> 00:18:14,940
like you ever see what they
do to chickens and stuff?

296
00:18:14,941 --> 00:18:19,800
They shoot steroids into their fucking
chicken breasts and they can't even walk.

297
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:22,380
They're tipping over.
They clip off the front of their beaks.

298
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:26,910
The shit that we do to animals,
um, is fucking horrible.

299
00:18:26,911 --> 00:18:31,620
And I gotta be honest with you, this
whole fucking thing is we do it, you know,

300
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:36,900
so human beings don't suffer. Uh,
you know, I, I don't know about that.

301
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,630
I think at this point they're
just doing it for money.

302
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:42,360
I think enough animals have suffered.

303
00:18:42,361 --> 00:18:47,070
So I actually agree with these militant
vegans as far as like how they,

304
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:50,070
they view what we do to animals,

305
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:56,010
but I stopped short of just marching on
to somebody's property and scaring the

306
00:18:56,011 --> 00:18:59,970
shit out of families
and stuff. I about, um,

307
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:04,170
the problem though is when you do shit
like that is everybody just says you're

308
00:19:04,171 --> 00:19:07,380
an asshole.
But no one was listening to them before.

309
00:19:07,381 --> 00:19:11,880
So what are they supposed to do?
I'm calling this right now.

310
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,370
Militant vegans are going to invade

311
00:19:16,610 --> 00:19:17,390
mmm

312
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:22,390
oh farm and their love of animals will
make them approach an animal they should

313
00:19:22,761 --> 00:19:25,670
not approach. And somebody's gonna
get hurt on the beacon side. That's,

314
00:19:25,671 --> 00:19:30,590
that's my prediction. Nia. What
do you say about that? Yeah,

315
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:35,450
that's it. Can you Cheney just come,
I don't have any fucking emails.

316
00:19:35,451 --> 00:19:36,500
I don't have any advertising.

317
00:19:36,501 --> 00:19:39,680
Can you fucking pick up a microphone and
helped me out for a couple of minutes?

318
00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:42,240
Jesus quite,
you know what's funny about you?

319
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:46,760
The level that you stress
when we go to the airport,

320
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:51,350
I'm just packing. I'm getting myself
together. Okay. Let's try to be prepared.

321
00:19:52,130 --> 00:19:54,890
Okay.
Is this going to be the energy?

322
00:19:55,010 --> 00:19:59,700
Are you going to come in and have a
little fun in the middle of my thing?

323
00:19:59,701 --> 00:20:02,360
So I was kind of focused
on that, but uh, unpack,

324
00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:06,500
I'm bringing a backpack and
a in a little carry on. Okay.

325
00:20:06,530 --> 00:20:08,540
For this trip and I'm
just letting you know,

326
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:12,950
I'm packing one shirt and one pair of
pants from my entire tour and then I'll

327
00:20:12,951 --> 00:20:15,500
have a,
I'll have a fucking,

328
00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:20,950
is this guy a bookie track suit and for
my flights and then I'll just have some

329
00:20:21,621 --> 00:20:25,310
walking around town close and then
a bunch of underwear and socks.

330
00:20:25,310 --> 00:20:28,590
That's how I'm doing. That's
not doing it. Okay for you.

331
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,980
Where are your comedy instincts?

332
00:20:30,981 --> 00:20:34,760
Just what you're supposed to go against
it like you did last night. We were like,

333
00:20:34,910 --> 00:20:38,120
we're going to be going out to
dinner. I was, I was getting there,

334
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:42,170
but you just jumped in. I had a
chance to, I was going to say, okay,

335
00:20:42,171 --> 00:20:45,470
well what about, and then I was going
to get into it. All right, Andrew,

336
00:20:45,471 --> 00:20:46,670
edit all of this out.

337
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:52,980
All right, well, Gee, I don't
know. Don't edit this shit.

338
00:20:53,010 --> 00:20:55,640
I don't give a fuck what no is,

339
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:58,810
it really isn't really gonna bother you
if I went to same shirt every night.

340
00:20:58,870 --> 00:21:02,900
Yeah. Like you know, I think we're going
to be going out to dinner, this and that.

341
00:21:02,910 --> 00:21:07,600
You're not gonna switch it up at all.
You know what it is,

342
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:11,890
and yet when you're going
country to country, country,

343
00:21:11,891 --> 00:21:15,010
which I will be doing after we have
a little few days there in Iceland.

344
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:16,373
[inaudible]

345
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:20,980
it's like your stuff just becomes
a burden. Yeah, no, I got it.

346
00:21:20,990 --> 00:21:22,400
So you just want to like,

347
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:26,990
you know Jim Morrison where
the same fucking brown
leather pants his entire tour.

348
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:30,620
Look at that guy.
Everybody still loves him.

349
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:35,410
He's not dead because of his pants. Are
you comparing yourself to Jim Morrison?

350
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:39,680
My traveling? Yes. Jesus.
The way I travel. Wow.

351
00:21:39,681 --> 00:21:43,010
If it was good enough for Jim Morrison is
good enough for me. Right, right. Well,

352
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:47,930
I talked to Steven Adler and I said,
dude, you going on a one world tour?

353
00:21:47,931 --> 00:21:51,290
What are you doing? He goes, easy. He
goes, one pair of pants, two shirts. Yeah,

354
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:54,330
sounds disgusting.
Well,

355
00:21:54,331 --> 00:21:56,610
you're going to hit somebody who's going
to give you a shirt while you're out

356
00:21:56,611 --> 00:21:59,670
there if you're a rock star,
right? So you're just trusting.

357
00:21:59,671 --> 00:22:00,740
So that's what you're going for us.

358
00:22:00,870 --> 00:22:04,590
And I'll look if you're a regular guy like
me, when you audience list Copenhagen.

359
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,470
Oh, this is how, that's
what you're waiting for. No,

360
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:09,210
this is how it works is pretty stylish.
So maybe they can help you out.

361
00:22:09,211 --> 00:22:10,930
I don't know.
First of all,

362
00:22:10,931 --> 00:22:14,260
any European gives me a shirt is not
going to fit because they were like child

363
00:22:14,261 --> 00:22:17,570
sizes over there. Yeah. Um, there,

364
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:21,700
there's this slim Whitman over there. Now
here's the deal. As far as a rock star,

365
00:22:21,730 --> 00:22:24,220
you're going to bang a chicken.
Then they're going to give you stuff.

366
00:22:24,221 --> 00:22:27,070
That's how it works. When you're a rock
star, if you just a regular guy like me,

367
00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:29,230
if you bag somebody,
you lose a shirt.

368
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:32,780
That's how it worked when I was a
single man. Okay. I'm not saying now,

369
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:36,090
I'm not saying I'm going to go
this Shlomo arena they and try to,

370
00:22:39,370 --> 00:22:42,980
I wish I was going to Tel Aviv. I bet
you do. Well, I'm going to go there.

371
00:22:42,981 --> 00:22:46,040
I'll get the lay of the land.
I'll go to the weep and wall.

372
00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:50,780
Was that what they call it? I don't
know. The crying, weeping Lawson's right.

373
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:51,733
Is that right?

374
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,073
[inaudible]

375
00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:54,170
I dunno. I don't, I don't, I,

376
00:22:54,171 --> 00:22:57,450
I'm not into any of that stuff so I'm
going to like respectfully stay away from

377
00:22:57,451 --> 00:22:59,580
those things. I'm going to go over
there and see if they go to Mcdonald's.

378
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:04,690
I'm perfect.
Get myself a quarter pounder with cheese.

379
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:09,820
No, I'm actually really looking good
forward to it because uh, you know,

380
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:13,180
historically speaking Jewish people as
some of the funniest people on the planet.

381
00:23:13,210 --> 00:23:14,630
You know,
if you go through showbusiness,

382
00:23:14,790 --> 00:23:18,730
you remember that Adam Sandler Song
there, Huh? Yeah. All three stooges.

383
00:23:19,370 --> 00:23:24,080
[inaudible] the Hanukkah Song.
I know that song. Yeah. What do,

384
00:23:24,110 --> 00:23:27,110
what do you mean? I'm just saying he
named all these fuckers funny people.

385
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:32,000
He was naming all these people who
are Jewish. Yeah. Yeah. That was fun.

386
00:23:32,050 --> 00:23:35,460
I don't know why this is so hard.
Nia.

387
00:23:35,461 --> 00:23:37,630
What happened to our chemistry and I know.

388
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:45,800
All right. At the height of you loving
me, scale of one to 10 was it at,

389
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:49,580
what do you mean? At the height of me?
Lemme Yeah. What is that supposed to mean?

390
00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:54,680
Why? I know you never got
to 10 dip down. Yeah, no.

391
00:23:55,820 --> 00:24:00,530
Where are you at currently? Okay. I know
you still love me, but as far where's the,

392
00:24:00,531 --> 00:24:04,970
like the, the like is what
shifts in a marriage. Oh,
that's true. Yeah. On one to 10.

393
00:24:05,670 --> 00:24:10,610
It's like a pretty solid like seven. No,
that's good. I'll take a seven and a half.

394
00:24:10,890 --> 00:24:15,050
Good. I've been pretty good about
not a yelling right. I'm a good boy.

395
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:18,110
Can you pat me on the head? Oh, thank you.

396
00:24:21,650 --> 00:24:22,490
You on the other hand,

397
00:24:22,491 --> 00:24:25,640
leaving the damn door open while
we get the fucking heat on near.

398
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:28,280
You got the door open. You're like,
I'm going back out. And it was like,

399
00:24:28,450 --> 00:24:30,260
and also she was walking in and out of it,

400
00:24:30,261 --> 00:24:33,260
so it was kind of like letting her do
that before I got all our stuff together

401
00:24:33,261 --> 00:24:37,520
to go out there. If once again I express
something and there's just, Oh my God,

402
00:24:37,521 --> 00:24:40,280
can you imagine taking that hit from
shower? Jesus, he went up high there.

403
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,460
That guy just fucking helmet almost
came off. Yeah, that's a good deal.

404
00:24:44,461 --> 00:24:48,080
From the uh, he scored
the goal for the uh, oh,

405
00:24:48,290 --> 00:24:51,470
he didn't score the wrong guy. There
was a guy from the king's though Muslim.

406
00:24:53,730 --> 00:24:57,380
Um, all right Nia, this has
been a incredible, you know,

407
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:59,000
I know you're distracted.

408
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:03,380
I'm sorry I've distracted cause I am
trying to like get my stuff together here.

409
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:07,970
Is that a green bag now? It's a little
green. Yeah. Green like this microphone.

410
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:11,300
What does it go to call it a
window and say that's lime green.

411
00:25:11,890 --> 00:25:15,070
You're bringing neon green. You're
bringing the eighties back. Yeah,

412
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:17,480
it's neon green.
It's my carry on.

413
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:22,080
So I'm trying to get it together
and see what's happening.

414
00:25:23,150 --> 00:25:24,470
I downloaded that album,

415
00:25:25,670 --> 00:25:28,340
I downloaded that album where
they took that sample from.

416
00:25:28,970 --> 00:25:31,240
It's such a killer album.
Uh,

417
00:25:31,350 --> 00:25:33,530
the only reason why I know about
us because I'm reading the uh,

418
00:25:33,531 --> 00:25:36,510
the Beastie boys book and

419
00:25:38,090 --> 00:25:39,890
who got you that book?
You did.

420
00:25:39,950 --> 00:25:42,680
And you know what's really cool in the
middle out of nowhere, not in the middle.

421
00:25:42,681 --> 00:25:45,680
Towards the end is Cha chef Roy Choi.

422
00:25:47,810 --> 00:25:50,060
Ah Yeah. He's in there.
Cause he's a Beastie boy fan.

423
00:25:50,061 --> 00:25:53,960
He got to know them and he actually
gives you some recipes. Really? Yeah.

424
00:25:53,961 --> 00:25:55,870
In the middle of their
frigging autobiography.

425
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:59,510
How great is that book really has
everything. All right, so here's an album.

426
00:25:59,610 --> 00:26:04,610
You got to download a, you gotta
download. Uh, the fuck is this guy's name,

427
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:11,210
Eugene McDaniels, headless
heroes of the apocalypse. Uh,

428
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:12,730
you got you gotta check that out.

429
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:16,550
The supermarket blues might be my
favorite fucking song on there.

430
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,470
The drums are awesome. I don't even know
what that's about. Just sounds funny. Oh,

431
00:26:22,510 --> 00:26:24,620
well he's not kidding around.
Now this is a very, uh,

432
00:26:24,621 --> 00:26:28,430
I believe why people would say
militant rather than he's a,

433
00:26:28,490 --> 00:26:32,960
a African American man expressing
his displeasure with white people.

434
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:35,750
We say he's militant,
which sounds borderline military,

435
00:26:35,990 --> 00:26:40,340
which white people do support unless
it's a black only sort of movement

436
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:45,730
as far as I could tell.
Minute 22 to go in the second period.

437
00:26:45,810 --> 00:26:49,170
And yet you're Boston Bruins are
up three games to one. Oh my God.

438
00:26:49,171 --> 00:26:53,510
He missed Jesus Christ. Nice thing. Maple
leaves. That is the Toronto may police.

439
00:26:53,610 --> 00:26:56,790
This is an original six playoff
series is what you're looking at here.

440
00:26:57,630 --> 00:27:02,010
That was awesome. Well, this
has been great. Uh, I'll
catch you guys on the flip.

441
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:05,220
On the flip refilling.
Okay. Enjoy your packing.

442
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:07,370
Yeah.

443
00:27:07,370 --> 00:27:10,970
You know what sucks about traveling with
your wife is no matter how light you

444
00:27:10,971 --> 00:27:15,320
pack, you still got to go downstairs
to that fucking baggage claim.

445
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:18,040
It's the purple one.

446
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:20,153
Yeah,

447
00:27:20,210 --> 00:27:22,130
the purple one with the Hanky on it.

448
00:27:22,370 --> 00:27:26,210
It's always like piled on top
of three others. You fuck up?

449
00:27:26,350 --> 00:27:29,480
You Alumba now the maple leaf,
so race and down the ice.

450
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:31,940
Look at this shit they
use in the maple leaf.

451
00:27:31,941 --> 00:27:34,940
She saw in the first 12 minutes
of the game, but he had come yet.

452
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,410
Boston Bruins dumping. Oh, tell a little
dump and chase here the other way.

453
00:27:39,411 --> 00:27:42,960
We just contend to go in up three to one.
I hope butch Cassidy,

454
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,730
he gets on the rest. Why not? Fuck, we're
job that tried to get called up before.

455
00:27:47,370 --> 00:27:48,203
Okay.

456
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:51,610
You're trying to make me have
to put my house on the market.

457
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,580
That's what I would say as
a head coach in any sport.

458
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:57,040
I would always bring up
the fact that if they lose,

459
00:27:57,041 --> 00:28:01,000
I'm going to have to sell my house and
go home and tell my children that we're

460
00:28:01,001 --> 00:28:03,820
moving away from their friends.
All right.

461
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:08,440
Or You fucking assholes could go out
here and score some goddamn goals for me.

462
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:13,120
Neo, do you think about
militant vegans in Australia?

463
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:20,830
Sounds pretty scary. Yeah. That down
there shaking her head of fucking lettuce.

464
00:28:20,870 --> 00:28:21,703
People

465
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:28,900
yelling about how much protein's in
iceberg lettuce versus a chicken or

466
00:28:29,121 --> 00:28:29,954
something.

467
00:28:31,950 --> 00:28:32,230
Yeah.

468
00:28:32,230 --> 00:28:36,310
I have to be honest,
anytime I have eaten just vegetarian,

469
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:39,160
you feel great,
you feel light and all of that shit.

470
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:43,960
But there's definitely man, you eat a
fucking steak and cheese, you need a nap.

471
00:28:45,010 --> 00:28:46,480
Speaking of which,
Nia.

472
00:28:47,250 --> 00:28:47,860
Oh,

473
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:50,380
I said stay.
Speaking of which they can chase.

474
00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:52,350
Oh,

475
00:28:52,350 --> 00:28:57,230
favorite sandwich I know has been fucking
killing it at the gym and on a diet.

476
00:28:58,120 --> 00:28:58,540
Yeah,

477
00:28:58,540 --> 00:29:02,170
it's amazing. And you know what? She told
me really warm my heart. She told me,

478
00:29:02,171 --> 00:29:04,990
you know why I'm losing this
weight? I said, why? She said,

479
00:29:04,991 --> 00:29:09,991
I'm doing it for you because what you
think about me is my entire self esteem.

480
00:29:12,430 --> 00:29:13,270
And I was just like,

481
00:29:13,271 --> 00:29:15,760
that is the most beautiful femme
trying to get it back on the pockets.

482
00:29:16,030 --> 00:29:19,480
That's the most beautiful thing
anybody has ever said to me.

483
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:21,113
Okay.

484
00:29:21,770 --> 00:29:23,240
And then she told me,
you know what,

485
00:29:23,241 --> 00:29:25,460
I really think these
feminists are out of line.

486
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:29,540
One of the worst things that ever
happened to women was we left the kitchen.

487
00:29:30,370 --> 00:29:31,580
It's just unbelievable.

488
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:33,360
Okay,

489
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:33,440
listen,

490
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:37,440
you already threw me under the and did
you already threw me under the bus at

491
00:29:37,441 --> 00:29:42,190
Conan. All right, so I'm not gonna take
anymore fucking slander out of you. Thank

492
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:46,420
you very much. Time out. Time
out word slander is abusing.

493
00:29:46,630 --> 00:29:48,400
Slandered my name.
How?

494
00:29:48,490 --> 00:29:53,030
Because you went on Conan and
threw me under the bus hop. No.

495
00:29:53,050 --> 00:29:55,780
Slander is if I go and I say
something that isn't true.

496
00:29:56,110 --> 00:29:59,380
Acting like you know things you don't
know anything. I know it's swearing.

497
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:03,490
You guessing everything and you throw me
under the bus and I'm sick of it. Well,

498
00:30:03,491 --> 00:30:06,250
wait a minute. Wait a minute. What?
Did I throw you under the bus?

499
00:30:06,251 --> 00:30:09,760
Or was it slander is both.
This was not bus throwing.

500
00:30:10,780 --> 00:30:15,400
It was not. You said white people
in the Middle Ages. I'm not.

501
00:30:15,401 --> 00:30:19,540
I'm not into it. First of all,
it was made in jest. Okay.

502
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:24,120
Kind of all you know. Yeah. I don't know.

503
00:30:24,210 --> 00:30:28,080
It wasn't meant for the public to hear
act that Nia, can I tell you something?

504
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:32,880
And most people thought it was
funny. Well, I got dragged.

505
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:37,280
Which gay?
You got 18 fucking Instagram messages.

506
00:30:37,370 --> 00:30:40,020
You got people you know,
making up fake burner accounts,

507
00:30:40,021 --> 00:30:42,960
trying to troll me and
all that kind of stuff.

508
00:30:43,010 --> 00:30:47,300
Do you realize how stupid Asshole, I'm
still not going to watch game of Thrones.

509
00:30:47,310 --> 00:30:48,210
I don't give a fuck.

510
00:30:49,830 --> 00:30:53,340
I don't care about white people in the
middle ages or white people with fake

511
00:30:53,341 --> 00:30:53,821
accounts.

512
00:30:53,821 --> 00:30:58,821
You and your incest dragons and
all that shit that you like.

513
00:30:59,071 --> 00:31:00,540
Y'All can keep that and listen,

514
00:31:00,541 --> 00:31:03,630
there's plenty of black people
who like game of Thrones,

515
00:31:03,631 --> 00:31:05,190
so why don't you go hang out with them?

516
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:08,770
But this black person will be over here
and you're working with different work.

517
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:10,800
Okay,
what can we do with game of Thrones?

518
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:13,650
You can send that shit straight
into blockbuster because

519
00:31:17,030 --> 00:31:17,863
yeah.

520
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:24,450
Oh, have we brought that to
the podcast yet? That's our
new, that's our new saying.

521
00:31:24,630 --> 00:31:29,520
Bill came up with it. Oh yeah, of
course. Oh, you're watching some trailer.

522
00:31:29,690 --> 00:31:33,240
There's something, some movie and
I didn't like it. Oh, funny. Yeah.

523
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:36,480
Like you can take that shit straight to
blockbuster cause I ain't watching and

524
00:31:36,481 --> 00:31:37,660
then now die.

525
00:31:37,850 --> 00:31:42,510
Now what that's become is if some is just
suggested, hey, we should go to brunch.

526
00:31:42,690 --> 00:31:44,480
There's a new place down the street.
What do you think about that?

527
00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:48,710
You can take that shit straight to logic
and watching it. I ain't doing that.

528
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:53,540
That's it. All right. Let me get back
to what I'm doing here. Okay. Ania,

529
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:54,930
just for the record,
you know,

530
00:31:54,931 --> 00:31:58,620
just so I can throw myself onto
the bus and be there to, um,

531
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:03,990
I don't care about black people in
Superhero movies as in you don't want to

532
00:32:03,991 --> 00:32:08,160
watch them. I gotta be more honest
or white people in Superhero movies.

533
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:13,470
I don't like superhero movies.
Superhero movies. I get it.

534
00:32:13,950 --> 00:32:18,390
Okay, you're a nerd, but you're really
a superhero. And for some reason,

535
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:21,720
some people don't realize how fucking
shredded you are underneath he is dumb

536
00:32:21,721 --> 00:32:24,660
sweater and your glasses.
All right.

537
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:29,760
It's so fucking stupid and all
that other kind of stuff. No,

538
00:32:29,790 --> 00:32:33,900
I don't mind the comic books when I was
a kid. But this whole fucking thing,

539
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:39,620
like I don't like how nerds go there
and they look at these people in

540
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:43,430
just peak human slash uh,
whatever, whatever else.

541
00:32:43,431 --> 00:32:48,431
They are fucking alien a condition and
they actually have the balls to sit there

542
00:32:50,181 --> 00:32:51,620
and say that they can relate.

543
00:32:51,950 --> 00:32:55,910
You clearly haven't watched any
because you don't understand the whole,

544
00:32:55,911 --> 00:32:59,690
like how the story goes for those putting
me, I haven't watched any, that's like,

545
00:32:59,691 --> 00:33:04,220
they're all like allegories for stuff
going on and like actual life and like,

546
00:33:04,221 --> 00:33:07,880
you know, human condition and
that type of thing. It's not just,

547
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:12,360
it's not that deep. It's not that deep.
I see it when I watch, when I watch it,

548
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:14,960
I'm saying I didn't need
you to explain that to me.

549
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:19,610
Well I know when I go see a Pixar movie,
I know I say Jews about global warming.

550
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:22,570
Okay, but you're, I mean,
I'm just saying though,

551
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:25,520
you're acting like you don't know cause
you're, you're very, uh, your leg.

552
00:33:25,521 --> 00:33:30,170
Very dismissive of the people who
like, uh, the, the superhero stuff.

553
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:35,390
Don't you want to stand? My business
formula is attacking popular shit.

554
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:38,900
Oh, right. Uh Huh. Yeah. Oh,
you don't think it's working?

555
00:33:42,870 --> 00:33:46,400
All right. I, I've Shit on
star wars since day one,

556
00:33:46,430 --> 00:33:50,090
which they keep taking new ones and
they're doing better and better.

557
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:53,660
Not since day one.
I liked it when I was a kid.

558
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:56,113
MMM.

559
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:59,280
All right. Well, I guess she's
gone again. See that look,

560
00:33:59,290 --> 00:34:03,270
see how that just worked there. All right,
let's get back to slandering my wife.

561
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:08,760
What are your hobbies? Flying helicopters.
Playing drums, slandering. My wife

562
00:34:11,670 --> 00:34:15,690
is something else in the said and she
said it's specifically about white people

563
00:34:15,691 --> 00:34:18,660
in North Carolina.
She was like,

564
00:34:18,661 --> 00:34:21,720
I'd have all that dumb
southerners that are out there.

565
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:25,170
White people in North Carolina.
She never said that.

566
00:34:27,030 --> 00:34:27,863
MMM.

567
00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:31,930
Sorry, I'm typing in my password
here. All right. It's three to one in.

568
00:34:31,931 --> 00:34:33,670
There's one period left.
Okay.

569
00:34:33,970 --> 00:34:37,060
And I don't think there's anybody
relaxed right now on either side of this

570
00:34:37,061 --> 00:34:41,920
fucking red line. All right. I'll tell
you when you got someone of that caliber,

571
00:34:42,970 --> 00:34:47,490
Austin Matthews and whatever Tavares
his first name is, and I'll tell you,

572
00:34:47,910 --> 00:34:51,630
Addison is no slouch doe at this
score a take away from all these kids,

573
00:34:51,631 --> 00:34:55,050
but playing for these first five games
to this series, I'll tell you right now,

574
00:34:55,950 --> 00:34:59,310
the Bruins, I mean I know they're
happy to be up to two goals here,

575
00:34:59,311 --> 00:35:04,170
but they still got their work cut out
for him. By the way. I didn't see it.

576
00:35:04,290 --> 00:35:06,960
Did anybody see the fucking
rough and rowdy in West Virginia?

577
00:35:07,950 --> 00:35:11,490
How bought a fucking round of
applause for West Virginia?

578
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:14,430
Everybody's always shitting on them.
Okay.

579
00:35:14,431 --> 00:35:17,130
But no one ever talks about how
fucking entertaining they are.

580
00:35:17,370 --> 00:35:19,700
You never going to see
a group of people jet,

581
00:35:19,710 --> 00:35:22,950
I mean the level that they threw them.
So just the highlights from those fights.

582
00:35:22,970 --> 00:35:24,270
You see that fucking guy,

583
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:28,630
he was getting fucking
lit up by the other duty,

584
00:35:28,650 --> 00:35:33,120
just ducked down like Marshawn back in
the day when he would tip somebody over,

585
00:35:33,390 --> 00:35:38,010
he fucking went down, pick this guy up
and just body slammed. It became like an

586
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:42,690
MMA event. Um, and I have a, uh,

587
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:45,300
I actually, I retweeted the, the, uh,

588
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:50,970
the clip from a Dan Katz centered over a,

589
00:35:50,971 --> 00:35:55,200
or tweeted it out. How the fuck you
supposed to say? Rough and rowdy.

590
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:57,600
I'll tell you right now
that rough and rowdy,

591
00:35:57,601 --> 00:35:59,700
the more rough and rowdy
the city they go to,

592
00:35:59,701 --> 00:36:02,970
the more rough and rowdy it becomes.
Um,

593
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:05,050
okay.

594
00:36:05,050 --> 00:36:06,490
I miss going to those fucking events.

595
00:36:06,491 --> 00:36:09,040
I want to fucking the next one
that comes out. If I'm not fucking,

596
00:36:09,041 --> 00:36:13,350
I'm always working.
I've got to stay home one night.

597
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:14,380
Yeah.

598
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:17,680
With a bunch of other comics that were
just off that night and I want to watch

599
00:36:17,681 --> 00:36:21,660
that fight. Well, maybe I'll just tape
it. Why don't I do that? I Dunno, Bill,

600
00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:24,340
there's a lot of technology out there.
Jesus Christ.

601
00:36:24,341 --> 00:36:28,530
Do I need some fucking reads at
this point? All right. Here we go.

602
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:34,690
Oh my God.
I thought I had a new advertiser.

603
00:36:34,691 --> 00:36:37,240
I thought there was a new
website called my for skin.

604
00:36:38,010 --> 00:36:38,843
Okay.

605
00:36:39,090 --> 00:36:42,840
It's actually an email says my
wife is disgusted by my, for skin.

606
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:45,840
That is the dumbest shit ever.

607
00:36:45,841 --> 00:36:49,890
It's like she'll get fucking had
it when you met her. You grew one.

608
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:51,440
Yeah.

609
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:53,630
Jesus Christ. Will you coming down
the aisle and she's just like,

610
00:36:53,631 --> 00:36:55,970
why am I marrying this
guy with an ugly Dick?

611
00:36:58,910 --> 00:37:00,590
Isn't that ridiculous?
How they fucking,

612
00:37:00,620 --> 00:37:05,620
they just mutilate you the second you
come out and women find a mutilated man.

613
00:37:05,991 --> 00:37:09,800
Disgusting. Can you imagine
that? Aimia you know what?

614
00:37:09,801 --> 00:37:11,600
I find your clip disgusting.

615
00:37:14,630 --> 00:37:17,510
Sorry, I'm just trying to get
her back in here. Um, all right,

let's do some reads here. Oh, look

stacks of resumes,

618
00:37:30,521 --> 00:37:35,410
a confusing review process. Why do
I have to take off my shirt? But,

619
00:37:36,070 --> 00:37:40,000
but today hiring can be easy

Ziprecruiter is the smartest
way to hire simply safe.

637
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:49,410
10 years ago, getting home
securities stunk. It was silly.

638
00:38:50,030 --> 00:38:51,820
It was a soliloquy.
Uh,

639
00:38:51,821 --> 00:38:55,900
it felt like companies went out of their
way to make your life miserable with

640
00:38:55,901 --> 00:38:58,180
long contracts.
She never knew what you'd get.

641
00:38:58,181 --> 00:39:01,990
You'd pay and they made you
rewire your whole, whole home.

642
00:39:02,470 --> 00:39:03,490
This was normal.

643
00:39:03,670 --> 00:39:08,440
Then simply safe comes along and
totally transforms home security.

644
00:39:08,650 --> 00:39:12,970
They did everything right. They built a
better system and they treat you right.

645
00:39:12,971 --> 00:39:17,500
Simply safe stands up to the
unexpected from burglars to blizzards,

646
00:39:17,530 --> 00:39:18,580
to blackouts,

647
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:21,493
blizzards.

648
00:39:23,310 --> 00:39:27,750
What is it safe to when there's a
blizzard out? So keep your jewelry warmer.

649
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:33,170
Let's have an internal heater,
blackouts, Nia, um, anyways,

650
00:39:33,510 --> 00:39:35,880
all those little swim goggles for,

651
00:39:35,881 --> 00:39:40,590
you know who that I mentioned? What a
good swimmer. My daughter is already.

652
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:43,020
She doesn't even use floaties anymore.

653
00:39:43,021 --> 00:39:46,920
She's just on that little let long
little worm float tube thing, whatever.

654
00:39:46,921 --> 00:39:51,020
They got the noodle crushing it.

655
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:53,510

dispatch everything to keep your home

657
00:39:57,261 --> 00:40:02,210

choice and a wire cutter top pick.

687
00:41:53,091 --> 00:41:54,670
We're up to 42 minutes here near,

688
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:58,610
we're in the break between
the second and third period.

689
00:41:58,611 --> 00:42:02,840
The Bruins are up three games to one
and I think I owe it to my listeners to

690
00:42:02,841 --> 00:42:07,490
podcasts right through the end of
this game. If they give a fuck right.

691
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:09,841
By the way,

692
00:42:09,841 --> 00:42:14,580
congratulations to the second batch
of stand up comics that went up on our

693
00:42:14,581 --> 00:42:18,690
premium blend style show
for comedy central. Uh,

694
00:42:18,691 --> 00:42:23,340
my good buddy Josh Adam Meyers closed
out the second one and absolutely

695
00:42:23,341 --> 00:42:25,020
murdered.
Um,

696
00:42:25,021 --> 00:42:29,820
so many people had fucking
monster is sets during this, uh,

697
00:42:29,850 --> 00:42:34,850
during the taping and they made all things
comedy look really good and a comedy

698
00:42:34,981 --> 00:42:39,150
central was psyched and uh,
hopefully we'll get to do it some more.

699
00:42:39,151 --> 00:42:41,430
And I loved the whole process,

700
00:42:41,431 --> 00:42:44,820
getting to meet all these young comics
up and come and getting to know who's the

701
00:42:44,821 --> 00:42:48,120
funny people and whatnot.
And uh,

702
00:42:49,260 --> 00:42:53,010
I dunno. Uh, it was, it was, I
think they, we got a home run there.

703
00:42:53,190 --> 00:42:55,080
So anyways,

704
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:58,800
let's get to some of the emails here
for the week and then we'll watch the

705
00:42:58,801 --> 00:43:00,290
Bruins game together.
We,

706
00:43:00,330 --> 00:43:04,230
although I imagine a bunch of people in
Toronto will be fucking turning this off

707
00:43:04,231 --> 00:43:08,700
if it stays the same or if they
have a miraculous comeback.

708
00:43:09,540 --> 00:43:13,410
Here's the deal. Uh, I'm going to do
it until fucking the end of regulation.

709
00:43:13,411 --> 00:43:17,070
I'm not gonna fucking,
I'm not going to keep going and you know,

710
00:43:17,071 --> 00:43:21,960
one of these fucking triple
overtime games. Um, all right. Okay.

711
00:43:22,410 --> 00:43:25,590
Emails, Kate Smith,

God bless America controversy.

713
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:33,270
Classic case of generations
not understanding each other.

714
00:43:33,570 --> 00:43:37,440
Love you and love the podcasts.
All right, let's check this out.

715
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:41,940
God bless America. Hey,
why is it when you know,

716
00:43:41,941 --> 00:43:43,770
every time?
Um,

717
00:43:46,590 --> 00:43:47,423
all right,

718
00:43:48,540 --> 00:43:53,540
morning yesterday that the game he's
quit claims Ms Rendition of God bless

719
00:43:53,911 --> 00:43:57,810
America during the seventh inning
stretch after the club was made aware of

720
00:43:58,230 --> 00:44:01,020
Smith's potential racism this morning,

721
00:44:01,021 --> 00:44:06,021
newspapers in Philadelphia report it
fliers or cutting ties with Smith to know

722
00:44:06,380 --> 00:44:10,890
when a statue honoring her with a
blanket. Smith, a popular singer,

723
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:11,880
the 1940s.

724
00:44:12,140 --> 00:44:15,880
Do you know what's hilarious? I got to tie
them out. That thing that they covered,

725
00:44:15,940 --> 00:44:20,350
the thing that they just covered Kate
Smith statue up with made her look like

726
00:44:20,950 --> 00:44:25,240
she was the next level. She looks, it
looks like she's wearing a Klan Hood,

727
00:44:25,870 --> 00:44:29,980
except it's all black like this,
you know,

728
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:32,040
the grand wizard clan guys,

729
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:34,020
you know,
I think he has a couple extra patches.

730
00:44:34,021 --> 00:44:38,550
It's Kinda like this cub scouts
except with a lot more hatred. Um,

731
00:44:40,890 --> 00:44:44,670
are you kidding me?
Ties with Smith to covering a statue.

732
00:44:44,700 --> 00:44:46,440
Honoring her with a blanket.

733
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:51,500
What is the evidence opera singer in the
1940s has been dead since 1986 she rose

734
00:44:53,401 --> 00:44:57,450
to fame in 1938 when Jewish composer,
composer,

735
00:44:58,170 --> 00:45:00,300
urban Berlin Railroad,
God bless America,

736
00:45:00,510 --> 00:45:05,510
specifically for Smith and as a peace
time protest of Adolf Hitler because of

737
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:08,333
Smith's rendition.

738
00:45:08,430 --> 00:45:12,350
God bless America became this
country's second national anthem.

739
00:45:12,660 --> 00:45:16,320
Wait a fucking minute. What is
this shit? This new evidence.

740
00:45:19,380 --> 00:45:24,150
Katie Smith racist evidence.

741
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:29,010
I mean, what did she send a text
message? Somebody just bomb.

742
00:45:34,610 --> 00:45:39,020
Okay. Wait a second. Wasn't
everybody racist back then?

743
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:40,220
Cause even if you are liberal,

744
00:45:40,250 --> 00:45:44,750
what you thought was nowhere near where
the fuck we are now. This is so dumb.

745
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:46,610
This is really bad,
man.

746
00:45:46,611 --> 00:45:49,790
You can't fucking go back when somebody's
not alive to defend themselves.

747
00:45:51,790 --> 00:45:54,550
All right. How come nobody
back then said she was racist?

748
00:45:56,660 --> 00:45:59,770
Is that because everyone was
racist back then? And if they were,

749
00:45:59,790 --> 00:46:04,790
wasn't she just evict them of her time
with the information that was available?

750
00:46:06,690 --> 00:46:09,600
I mean there was time people walked
around, they thought slavery you. Yet.

751
00:46:09,690 --> 00:46:13,410
It makes sense to me cause that's
what people did it. That's you know,

752
00:46:14,010 --> 00:46:15,570
there's a lot of shit
we're doing right now.

753
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:18,800
Do you think you're going to fucking get
to 80 and look back on shit you didn't

754
00:46:18,820 --> 00:46:20,100
your 20s, you're like, oh my God,

755
00:46:20,101 --> 00:46:24,050
I can't believe we used to do shit or
said that are eight data thought this all

756
00:46:24,090 --> 00:46:27,120
right.
Who says one fan can't make a difference?

757
00:46:27,270 --> 00:46:31,980
It was one fan who contacted the Yankees
about cage Smith's racist singing

758
00:46:31,981 --> 00:46:36,090
background that caused them to remove
the God bless America from the seventh

759
00:46:36,091 --> 00:46:41,091
inning stretch which cause Stefan Bondy
of the New York Daily News to write

760
00:46:41,881 --> 00:46:42,714
about it,

761
00:46:42,930 --> 00:46:47,640
which also caused the Philadelphia flyers
to not only remove her song but cover

762
00:46:47,641 --> 00:46:51,570
up the statue outside the extent,
uh, expanded he live as well.

763
00:46:51,900 --> 00:46:56,820
I spoke with Bondi before his insight
edition experience it appearance.

764
00:46:58,310 --> 00:47:00,950
He said, I obviously didn't
expect the reaction that it got.

765
00:47:00,951 --> 00:47:04,640
Well what did you think was gonna Happen?
Says Bondi,

766
00:47:04,641 --> 00:47:09,340
but I think it's a sign of the times in
a good sign that the flyers also reacted

767
00:47:09,350 --> 00:47:14,000
the way they did.
Meanwhile,

768
00:47:14,001 --> 00:47:16,940
the Redskins are still called the
Redskins. None of this shit makes sense.

769
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:22,220
So as Katie Smith really a racist or
struggling artists trying to get work,

770
00:47:22,250 --> 00:47:27,050
nobody knows, and I think that's still
part of the investigation. Bondi said,

771
00:47:27,380 --> 00:47:29,060
well then what the fuck?

772
00:47:30,470 --> 00:47:33,890
How are you going to investigate that
after she's dead and everybody else who

773
00:47:33,891 --> 00:47:37,490
was part of the class was dead.
How are you going to investigate this?

774
00:47:37,610 --> 00:47:42,370
You just slandered somebody fucking name.
Speaking of slander,

775
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:48,700
there's not been much as to
who Kate Smith is as a person.

776
00:47:48,910 --> 00:47:52,420
There hasn't been any stories to
suggest that she did anything racially

777
00:47:52,421 --> 00:47:56,050
insensitive in her private life.
But there are these songs.

778
00:47:56,370 --> 00:48:00,340
Bonnie said she was born in the south,
raised during the time of Jim Crow laws,

779
00:48:00,341 --> 00:48:04,180
yet this isn't her fault. It
was a racist time. They were.

780
00:48:04,450 --> 00:48:07,120
These were different times and
some of the things she said

781
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:11,580
would have been racist back then.
You still get to pick

782
00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:15,360
what,
wait a second,

783
00:48:15,390 --> 00:48:18,420
and some of the things she said
would have been racist back then.

784
00:48:18,421 --> 00:48:22,530
You still get to pick some of the songs
you sing. This is these fucking people.

785
00:48:22,531 --> 00:48:24,390
Who is this Brody person and let me,

786
00:48:24,420 --> 00:48:28,590
can we investigate your life through
this level? You never said anything.

787
00:48:28,591 --> 00:48:30,780
You didn't do anything.
You didn't laugh at somebody.

788
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:36,090
Can We destroy your fucking life now,
but a fucking sack over your head?

789
00:48:38,690 --> 00:48:42,470
What about the fact that these songs
were recorded so long ago when the times

790
00:48:42,471 --> 00:48:46,160
were so different? Obviously says, I
look at it talking to his Bondi person,

791
00:48:46,310 --> 00:48:48,170
like this person,
some sort of expert.

792
00:48:49,700 --> 00:48:54,700
I'm sure it was interpreted differently
in 1939 but it's not 1939 yeah,

793
00:48:55,441 --> 00:49:00,380
but it was when she did it
this shit back then. Dude.

794
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:01,950
That's like when they
come up with a new law.

795
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:05,280
You can't prosecute somebody for doing
something yesterday that today is now

796
00:49:05,281 --> 00:49:06,114
illegal,

797
00:49:09,070 --> 00:49:13,330
but it's not 1939 and that song is being
played to all sorts of people of race

798
00:49:13,331 --> 00:49:16,240
and color and creed at
Yankee Stadium in 2019 yet,

799
00:49:16,241 --> 00:49:18,070
God bless American at the racist song.

800
00:49:21,530 --> 00:49:23,360
I don't get this.
I don't get this at all.

801
00:49:29,620 --> 00:49:32,530
I don't get, I don't get this. Then
they try to get the flyers in trouble.

802
00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:35,860
You can also add the flyers to that
list is people not playing the song,

803
00:49:36,010 --> 00:49:39,370
but one has to wonder what
would they have done if it,

804
00:49:39,580 --> 00:49:44,290
if it were game seven of the Stanley Cup
finals and they played this song before

805
00:49:44,291 --> 00:49:47,890
the last three wins.
This is all this is.

806
00:49:47,891 --> 00:49:50,380
This whole fucking error is just
trying to get people in trouble.

807
00:49:50,890 --> 00:49:54,940
I think when you do something like that
to somebody, they should immediately,

808
00:49:55,570 --> 00:49:58,150
they should immediately
investigate your life.

809
00:49:59,290 --> 00:50:00,700
If you're going to take somebody down,

810
00:50:00,701 --> 00:50:03,850
we're not gonna investigate your life
to see if we need to take you down too.

811
00:50:04,510 --> 00:50:05,200
And you know what?

812
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:08,410
Watch everybody shut the fuck up
because we're all guilty of something

813
00:50:10,030 --> 00:50:14,710
myself included. Give me a fucking break.
We've all done shit. We've all said Shit.

814
00:50:14,860 --> 00:50:18,430
We, I mean part of life
is growing as a person.

815
00:50:21,070 --> 00:50:22,900
I bet if you asked her
at the end of her life,

816
00:50:22,901 --> 00:50:24,370
what do you think about those songs?

817
00:50:24,550 --> 00:50:27,370
I bet she did have a different
opinion than when the fuck she sung.

818
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:31,250
It didn't even say how old she
was when she sang the song.

819
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:35,690
It's so fucking stupid. I think that's
ridiculous. I think it's ridiculous.

820
00:50:36,290 --> 00:50:40,250
And it's this fucking thing that
white people who live now do,

821
00:50:40,370 --> 00:50:43,760
and they try to act like they're trying
to be brave and sensitive and what

822
00:50:43,761 --> 00:50:48,350
they're really doing is they're using
somebody else to fucking show how awesome

823
00:50:48,351 --> 00:50:51,080
they are as something it's I big.
It's all self serving.

824
00:50:52,930 --> 00:50:57,520
I don't know. And I'm also assuming this
person's white check probably shouldn't,

825
00:50:57,521 --> 00:51:01,900
but I dunno. I just know all of my black
friends, when I brought that country,

826
00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:05,350
it's about John, John Wayne.
They all just laughed. Like,

827
00:51:05,351 --> 00:51:07,000
who gives a fuck about a dead white guy?

828
00:51:07,060 --> 00:51:09,950
We're dealing with the white people
that are still alive. All right.

829
00:51:10,420 --> 00:51:13,210
Ukraine president. Uh, dear bill,

830
00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:18,720
President Day Oh oh oh
to virus point blank.

831
00:51:19,380 --> 00:51:23,920
58 58. So up by two Corollas. Dear Bill,

832
00:51:23,921 --> 00:51:28,180
President Date A, theirs is hope
for the world. Oh, thank God.

833
00:51:28,930 --> 00:51:32,100
Hey guys, how about some more positive
shit too? By the way, a company,

834
00:51:32,140 --> 00:51:34,000
a comedic personality from the Ukraine,

835
00:51:34,001 --> 00:51:38,980
just beat the incumbent in a
landslide to become president. What

836
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:42,450
is that a good thing?

837
00:51:43,930 --> 00:51:44,150
Yeah.

838
00:51:44,150 --> 00:51:47,170
I don't think I want a fucking
clown run in my country. Uh,

839
00:51:47,270 --> 00:51:49,820
when are you running and
what's your slogan going to be?

840
00:51:50,990 --> 00:51:55,870
A what will you do about the Middle East?
Who will be your vice?

841
00:51:56,890 --> 00:52:01,100
All right, I'll answer these questions.
Uh, is what I do about the Middle East.

842
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:08,400
Toronto just scored.
Oh,

843
00:52:08,870 --> 00:52:10,700
and now ladies and gentlemen,

844
00:52:10,701 --> 00:52:13,970
we have a fucking game here.

845
00:52:15,390 --> 00:52:17,850
Was that Austin Matthews again?
He's fucking awesome.

846
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:24,230
Oh my God.
They keep getting us with that fucking,

847
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:28,860
let me watch this replay.

848
00:52:33,140 --> 00:52:34,750
Oh my God. He came eat. Oh.

849
00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:38,630
Tuco went from right to left and then
he shot it over his right shoulder like

850
00:52:38,631 --> 00:52:43,580
the fucking sniper that he is top shelf.
And look at the look on his face.

851
00:52:43,610 --> 00:52:48,540
Look at him. Jesus Christ. All right bro.

852
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:52,520
Oh fuck me.
Fuck me.

853
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:56,060
I was relaxed and now I am not.

854
00:52:57,360 --> 00:52:59,970
Toronto wins the face
off in the Bruin zone.

855
00:53:02,190 --> 00:53:05,730
All right. Just relax. Don't be a bunch
of punk. Jason. Jackasses and just fuck,

856
00:53:06,370 --> 00:53:09,850
fuck. Oh boy. Oh boy. Oh
they got the puck. Oh Jesus.

857
00:53:10,360 --> 00:53:11,940
They go day to day.

858
00:53:13,450 --> 00:53:13,970
Okay.

859
00:53:13,970 --> 00:53:18,650
All right. I can't watch this shit. Here
you go. Take the fucking body something.

860
00:53:21,010 --> 00:53:22,630
Anyways,
um,

861
00:53:24,420 --> 00:53:27,480
hey man, what the fuck was talking about?
Oh, how I would solve the Middle East.

862
00:53:28,410 --> 00:53:32,100
All right. First of all, I would
convert this country to solar power.

863
00:53:33,500 --> 00:53:38,500
I would enact that guy from Tesla's
plans for that solar shit on the roads.

864
00:53:39,021 --> 00:53:40,160
And then is is,

865
00:53:40,330 --> 00:53:45,290
is I would just convert all
of this to solar. All right?

866
00:53:46,220 --> 00:53:50,900
And uh, I would give, you know, all of the
money to the oil companies and just say,

867
00:53:50,901 --> 00:53:51,231
listen,

868
00:53:51,231 --> 00:53:54,260
you're going to be out of this fucking
business and we're going to help you go

869
00:53:54,261 --> 00:53:57,050
over to this other business.
All right?

870
00:53:57,230 --> 00:53:59,970
So you're still getting all the
money from the energy you cons.

871
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:03,530
And then what's going to happen is there's
going to be no fucking money in the

872
00:54:03,530 --> 00:54:06,650
Middle East and then they won't have
any money to finance the terrorism.

873
00:54:06,950 --> 00:54:09,920
And then we're going to get the fuck
out of there and leave them alone.

874
00:54:11,080 --> 00:54:11,913
Okay.

875
00:54:12,300 --> 00:54:13,410
That's what we're going to do.

876
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:16,890
And then they can fucking live their
lives and we're going to live our lives.

877
00:54:17,930 --> 00:54:18,763
And then,

878
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:21,860
uh, I dunno if I would
have the power to do this,

879
00:54:21,861 --> 00:54:26,420
but I would go and I would evict all
the Jews out of Israel and all the

880
00:54:26,421 --> 00:54:30,640
Palestinians out of Palestine.
Fuck. Where would I put them?

881
00:54:31,450 --> 00:54:34,990
I gotta Give Him Beach Front property
cause it seems to be really important to

882
00:54:34,991 --> 00:54:35,560
those people.

883
00:54:35,560 --> 00:54:36,393
Cool.

884
00:54:39,090 --> 00:54:42,900
I give them all timeshares in Florida,

885
00:54:42,901 --> 00:54:46,530
Boca Raton,
we get Ahca poco going again,

886
00:54:47,460 --> 00:54:48,293
you know?

887
00:54:48,690 --> 00:54:50,550
No, there's no, there's no
self in the Middle East.

888
00:54:50,551 --> 00:54:53,430
But I would get us the fuck out of
that Hornets nest is what I would do.

889
00:54:54,060 --> 00:54:56,970
And I would leave those people alone
because it's their countries and they

890
00:54:56,971 --> 00:54:59,730
should be able to figure out what
the fuck goes on in their countries.

891
00:54:59,731 --> 00:55:01,740
And I'd converted to solar power.
That's what I was doing.

892
00:55:01,980 --> 00:55:05,430
My vice president would be
somebody way smarter than me

893
00:55:06,760 --> 00:55:10,330
and I would have them sound out all the
big words in my speeches before I went

894
00:55:10,331 --> 00:55:14,200
on TV. So you guys all thought I
was smart and you kept the faith.

895
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:19,360
All right. Then I would go to
blackwater and I would, uh,

896
00:55:19,361 --> 00:55:22,860
I would carve out a deal with them,
um,

897
00:55:24,340 --> 00:55:28,180
where we would take the
banking system back. All right.

898
00:55:29,410 --> 00:55:32,380
And, uh, we just whack
a couple of top bankers.

899
00:55:32,860 --> 00:55:35,410
I didn't think we'd have to do that.
We would just walk in and take them over.

900
00:55:36,790 --> 00:55:39,880
Take over. The banks are too big to fail.
Is that what you think daisy? All right.

901
00:55:40,060 --> 00:55:42,940
Their friend and they would
all go to fucking jail. Okay.

902
00:55:42,941 --> 00:55:45,580
And then the next one I would go to,
let's just like in a perfect world,

903
00:55:45,581 --> 00:55:45,971
like every,

904
00:55:45,971 --> 00:55:49,270
like all the politicians who get paid
by all these fucking crooked cops would

905
00:55:49,271 --> 00:55:50,500
somehow come along with me.

906
00:55:51,700 --> 00:55:55,840
Then I would go to the food fucking
industry and I would get al of those cons

907
00:55:55,841 --> 00:55:56,770
the fuck out of there.

908
00:55:56,830 --> 00:56:00,040
I'd find I'd go through their files
and find out what's really in our food.

909
00:56:00,760 --> 00:56:04,050
And simultaneously you'd go
to the pharmaceutical, uh,

910
00:56:05,860 --> 00:56:08,120
fucking industry and find
out why the fuck what,

911
00:56:08,180 --> 00:56:10,960
what they knew about
fentanyl and all of this.

912
00:56:10,961 --> 00:56:14,020
Because I've had a bunch of
people that I know affected by it.

913
00:56:14,021 --> 00:56:18,070
I've had friends die, I've had,
uh, friends have children die.

914
00:56:18,071 --> 00:56:22,300
It's just been fucking awful. That's
what I would do. And then, um,

915
00:56:23,140 --> 00:56:23,970
I would,
uh,

916
00:56:23,970 --> 00:56:27,280
and then the last thing I would do
was I would try to have some sort of a

917
00:56:29,330 --> 00:56:34,090
recycling program that works. And, um,

918
00:56:36,150 --> 00:56:38,730
I dunno if that's what the fuck
I would do and my vice president,

919
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:41,220
who would it be?
Who would it be?

920
00:56:44,510 --> 00:56:47,150
Um, oh, I, I get al Franken.

921
00:56:48,580 --> 00:56:53,210
I'd have him as a vice president.
Goats, all comedians in office.

922
00:56:54,870 --> 00:56:55,440
MMM.

923
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:55,891
I Dunno.

924
00:56:55,891 --> 00:56:59,580
I try to just get people that actually
give a shit about people rather than

925
00:56:59,581 --> 00:57:03,300
power and money. Like all of these
other fucking assholes, like the bushes,

926
00:57:03,301 --> 00:57:07,710
the Obama's, the trumps, the
Clintons, they just all bad people.

927
00:57:08,100 --> 00:57:11,580
Like, I feel like the last human being
that was an office was Jimmy Carter

928
00:57:12,260 --> 00:57:13,093
and

929
00:57:14,530 --> 00:57:15,670
you know,
let me look at the guy.

930
00:57:16,090 --> 00:57:19,360
What has he done since he's retired
other than build 4,000 houses for the

931
00:57:19,361 --> 00:57:23,470
fucking homeless, all these other
fucking assholes. What do they do?

932
00:57:23,471 --> 00:57:24,330
They go in though the,

933
00:57:24,850 --> 00:57:29,410
the speech tour and they go out and they
give speeches to the biggest fucking

934
00:57:29,411 --> 00:57:34,120
anti American goddamn corporate crooks.
Don't even get me started on this shit.

935
00:57:34,670 --> 00:57:35,950
I want to give me fucking started.

936
00:57:37,930 --> 00:57:38,560
Yeah.

937
00:57:38,560 --> 00:57:42,690
Where everybody loves fucking Obama in
his first two speeches and with two of

938
00:57:42,691 --> 00:57:46,800
the biggest fucking predatory
banks from fucking 2008. I mean,

939
00:57:46,830 --> 00:57:50,670
it's like they don't even try to hide,
but he's got a blue tie. So I like them.

940
00:57:51,330 --> 00:57:52,560
It's like these fucking morons.

941
00:57:52,820 --> 00:57:57,750
It's that can't even admit that
Trump is a fucking dope. I get it.

942
00:57:57,751 --> 00:58:00,720
You're Republican. I get it. You're
conservative. I get it. You want a wall?

943
00:58:00,721 --> 00:58:03,910
I get all of that. If that's what the
fuck you want. And I respected it.

944
00:58:03,980 --> 00:58:07,320
Fucking take it to the point where you
can't say that this guy's a bit of a

945
00:58:07,321 --> 00:58:11,340
fucking, you know, I understand
wind. Uh, I know all about the wind.

946
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:14,370
I mean the fact that you're comfortable
with that being your leader. I mean,

947
00:58:14,390 --> 00:58:17,730
I don't know what the fucking say to you.
Yeah.

948
00:58:17,731 --> 00:58:20,430
That is as annoying as people who prop up.

949
00:58:21,700 --> 00:58:21,940
Okay.

950
00:58:21,940 --> 00:58:23,320
You know,
the Obama's like,

951
00:58:23,321 --> 00:58:26,650
these were these great fucking people
rather than they were your typical

952
00:58:26,651 --> 00:58:29,980
politicians that had their
faces in the fucking pig trough.

953
00:58:29,981 --> 00:58:32,230
Just like all of them.
Just like all of them.

954
00:58:34,050 --> 00:58:34,883
MMM.

955
00:58:34,950 --> 00:58:39,720
No, he wears a different
color tie. He wears the color
tie that I like. All right,

956
00:58:39,721 --> 00:58:42,420
let's get on.
Let's not talk politics here.

957
00:58:42,421 --> 00:58:46,290
It just makes me annoyed and then I
start acting like I can solve all the

958
00:58:46,291 --> 00:58:49,380
problems and that I know things that I
really don't. So why don't we avoid that?

959
00:58:49,410 --> 00:58:53,670
Although that could be
part of the entertainment
though, right? Um, all right.

960
00:58:53,671 --> 00:58:58,450
What's the next thing here? Jesus
Christ. This is a long email.

961
00:59:01,820 --> 00:59:05,690
Why the fuck is this here?
Wife's a douchebag. Jesus Christ.

962
00:59:05,691 --> 00:59:08,180
Noisy sex. Ukraine president. Okay.

963
00:59:10,020 --> 00:59:10,560
MMM.

964
00:59:10,560 --> 00:59:14,530
Noisy neighbors having sex.
Dear Bill,

965
00:59:14,531 --> 00:59:16,900
you are one of my favorite
car of a thank you. Bye.

966
00:59:16,901 --> 00:59:20,740
Problem is I can hear my
neighbor's having loud, obnoxious.

967
00:59:23,090 --> 00:59:27,200
Well, it's the only way it's obnoxious
is if they're doing it to annoy you,

968
00:59:27,890 --> 00:59:31,310
they might be lost in
the throes of passion.

969
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:35,300
When was the last time we want to
fucking face off in this fucking game?

970
00:59:38,180 --> 00:59:39,013
MMM.

971
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:40,033
Anyways,

972
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:42,480
uh,

973
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:44,880
loud,
obnoxious sex at various times of the day,

974
00:59:44,881 --> 00:59:46,950
I left a note to them
addressing the problem.

975
00:59:47,160 --> 00:59:51,780
They left a condescending response
back with their phone number in it.

976
00:59:51,781 --> 00:59:55,130
Why on earth would I want to
discuss their sex life with them?

977
00:59:57,120 --> 01:00:00,810
Oh, I would've called them back
in a second. As you can see,

978
01:00:00,811 --> 01:00:04,800
I'm in quite the pickle here.
That is my next move.

979
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:06,910
Uh,

980
01:00:06,910 --> 01:00:11,840
and what should I do? Sinceriously
your biggest fan from New Paltz,

981
01:00:11,841 --> 01:00:15,500
New York. Oh two this is easy.
Go get yourself a sound system.

982
01:00:17,970 --> 01:00:19,570
All right? You got to do
a little research. Get us,

983
01:00:19,750 --> 01:00:23,620
get a sound system point of speakers
at the walls of your neighbor's house.

984
01:00:24,410 --> 01:00:28,570
All right? And then what should do, I
don't know if you can do a Google search.

985
01:00:29,320 --> 01:00:33,910
Find the most obnoxious sex
sounds from a porno you watch.

986
01:00:33,911 --> 01:00:37,360
You ever watch a porno and somebody is
like fucking over the top going like,

987
01:00:37,361 --> 01:00:41,110
oh wow. Like, you know, and it
literally takes you out of it.

988
01:00:41,560 --> 01:00:46,560
I would record that on a loop
and every time they have sex,

989
01:00:48,540 --> 01:00:51,390
you know,
I would play that.

990
01:00:51,450 --> 01:00:56,010
Or you just make a tape of
saying your mom's vagina,

991
01:00:56,610 --> 01:01:00,810
your mom's vagina,
your mom's vagina is wet right now.

992
01:01:01,540 --> 01:01:05,370
Just anything that will make that
guy lose his fucking hard on,

993
01:01:06,210 --> 01:01:07,110
have fun with it.

994
01:01:08,630 --> 01:01:12,200
And then just say that you're listening
to a new song by Yoko Ono and the

995
01:01:12,201 --> 01:01:15,080
plastic ono band and you know,
I think you'll get away with it.

996
01:01:15,620 --> 01:01:19,160
You gotta have fun with it, uh, recorded,

997
01:01:20,430 --> 01:01:24,660
you know, have somebody animate it and
all of that shit with you and your fucking

998
01:01:26,590 --> 01:01:30,130
yeah, send us, send us audio of it.
We, I have animators. I'll pay for it.

999
01:01:30,131 --> 01:01:30,830
We'll fucking,

1000
01:01:30,830 --> 01:01:33,580
we'll fucking make a little cartoon
it and then do that other shit.

1001
01:01:33,581 --> 01:01:34,414
Just fucking annoying

1002
01:01:34,490 --> 01:01:38,450
back. Fuck them. Um,

1003
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:44,800
and you also have their, uh, oh. And you
could like put their phone up now. Don't,

1004
01:01:44,801 --> 01:01:47,790
don't put their phone number out there
that there'll be a mean thing. Uh,

1005
01:01:47,950 --> 01:01:52,570
that'd be to meet taking it too far.
Ah. Alright. Wife's Douchebag boss.

1006
01:01:52,780 --> 01:01:54,760
Oh God.
Your wife has a douchebag boss.

1007
01:01:54,761 --> 01:01:58,270
So guess what you have to hear about
every night at dinner. What's up bill?

1008
01:01:58,300 --> 01:02:01,390
Billy Ball sniffer. Hoping forwards. Vice.

1009
01:02:01,840 --> 01:02:06,580
Why is Scott at douchebag?
Boss? Just a little background.

1010
01:02:07,030 --> 01:02:11,170
Oh, this is gonna be one of
these. No punctuations no
capital letters. No nothing.

1011
01:02:11,650 --> 01:02:14,230
Just a little background.
My wife is 45.

1012
01:02:14,500 --> 01:02:19,500
I'm 38 wife's Douchebag
boss 28 this jackass.

1013
01:02:19,980 --> 01:02:20,813
Thanks

1014
01:02:22,410 --> 01:02:27,410
this Jack has thinks it's
okay knowing she married.

1015
01:02:30,530 --> 01:02:35,350
Oh Jesus Christ. Dude. What the f this is
even a fucking, this isn't going centers.

1016
01:02:35,370 --> 01:02:38,520
This jackass thinks it's
okay knowing she's married.

1017
01:02:39,750 --> 01:02:43,110
Juju hit on her on a regular basis.
Little more backstory.

1018
01:02:43,380 --> 01:02:44,910
Last year at our Christmas party,

1019
01:02:44,911 --> 01:02:48,330
we were all drinking and he decided
there was okay to start hitting on her in

1020
01:02:48,331 --> 01:02:52,410
front of me. She has a great
job for a retail company in a,

1021
01:02:52,830 --> 01:02:57,570
in a, in a mall, make 70 k a year.

1022
01:02:57,630 --> 01:03:01,260
So I didn't want to screw it up, but
beating the ever living crap out of him

1023
01:03:03,120 --> 01:03:05,100
by, by beating the ever
living crap out of him.

1024
01:03:05,101 --> 01:03:10,050
I decided to let it slide the next day
he apologized and let it and I let it go.

1025
01:03:10,410 --> 01:03:11,340
Figuring he was just drunk,

1026
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:14,850
whoever since he likes to throw
little comments about how she smells.

1027
01:03:14,851 --> 01:03:16,710
Nice is dress great.

1028
01:03:16,770 --> 01:03:21,770
The little prick even likes to walk up
behind her and brush up against her act.

1029
01:03:22,580 --> 01:03:25,530
Well, what the fuck? She can't just
go to human resources at this point.

1030
01:03:26,220 --> 01:03:28,770
You don't even need evidence to get where
you got like fucking evidence of this

1031
01:03:28,771 --> 01:03:31,200
shit.
Just do that.

1032
01:03:36,240 --> 01:03:37,290
He says,
cool.

1033
01:03:37,291 --> 01:03:40,830
I know my wife is not the cheating type
or she wouldn't be telling me all this.

1034
01:03:41,160 --> 01:03:42,300
Yesterday she came home,

1035
01:03:42,301 --> 01:03:46,200
send me upset and told me while she
was in the food court eating lunch,

1036
01:03:46,380 --> 01:03:49,830
he came up behind her and told her,
you think she would be great in bed.

1037
01:03:50,040 --> 01:03:51,060
So here's my question,

1038
01:03:51,061 --> 01:03:54,720
before I drag this little shit stain
down to the food court and po and pull a

1039
01:03:54,721 --> 01:03:58,290
good fellows and stick his fucking head
in the pizza oven, what should I do?

1040
01:03:58,291 --> 01:04:03,240
So I don't end up going to jail.
This advice would be great.

1041
01:04:04,140 --> 01:04:08,220
Maybe something from near, it's
near with an n, not meal with an m.

1042
01:04:10,500 --> 01:04:14,190
Um, now you can't do that because then
you're going to go to jail and he won't,

1043
01:04:14,220 --> 01:04:16,980
I don't understand why she
doesn't complain to somebody.

1044
01:04:19,680 --> 01:04:20,760
I mean,
at this point,

1045
01:04:20,910 --> 01:04:25,470
all she would have to do is go on
Twitter saying who the fuck he was in his

1046
01:04:25,471 --> 01:04:29,190
career would be over.
I think she can just threaten to do that.

1047
01:04:29,320 --> 01:04:33,090
But if you fucking say one more goddamn
thing to me, sexually or otherwise,

1048
01:04:33,091 --> 01:04:37,470
I will go online and I will end you
fucking career faster than you can say

1049
01:04:37,471 --> 01:04:40,380
Harvey Weinstein. Alright. Um,

1050
01:04:40,470 --> 01:04:42,480
I actually think she should
just go to human resources.

1051
01:04:42,481 --> 01:04:44,340
I don't know why she doesn't.
Uh,

1052
01:04:44,370 --> 01:04:47,040
but you should not go and beat the shit
out of this guy because you're going to

1053
01:04:47,041 --> 01:04:49,760
get caught and you're going to go to jail.
Um,

1054
01:04:49,910 --> 01:04:52,950
and then that guy is going to continue
PR and then you think he's brushing up

1055
01:04:52,951 --> 01:04:55,830
against your wife as then. Forget about
when. What about when you're locked up?

1056
01:04:56,940 --> 01:05:00,630
Don't do that. I think you should. You
should go to the proper channels here.

1057
01:05:01,420 --> 01:05:05,370
All right, advice. My wife
is disgusted by my, for skin,

1058
01:05:06,670 --> 01:05:10,990
a brother.
10 minutes to go 10 minutes ago.

1059
01:05:11,010 --> 01:05:15,540
Please tell me we're not playing.
Not to lose. I mean not to uh, yeah,

1060
01:05:15,541 --> 01:05:17,710
to not lose.
However the expression goes.

1061
01:05:20,930 --> 01:05:23,600
Oh boy. Oh boy. You know
they're going to tie it up.

1062
01:05:23,660 --> 01:05:27,940
You know they're going to tie it up.
Jay says Christ,

1063
01:05:27,941 --> 01:05:29,170
get it out of there.

1064
01:05:29,620 --> 01:05:30,453
Yeah.

1065
01:05:33,780 --> 01:05:37,620
Oh my God. What are we doing? What
are we doing? All right. Hey, billing,

1066
01:05:38,140 --> 01:05:42,540
Billingham, fire crutch. Love the
podcast and the advice you give.

1067
01:05:42,541 --> 01:05:43,374
First off,

1068
01:05:43,380 --> 01:05:48,220
I'm personally fine with my old twigs
and berries and haven't thought before

1069
01:05:48,390 --> 01:05:49,141
skin going to be an issue.

1070
01:05:49,141 --> 01:05:52,830
But recently my wife of two years
has confessed that it makes her gag.

1071
01:05:53,700 --> 01:05:57,810
I noticed her reluctance to the one
eyed snake from the first time we were

1072
01:05:57,811 --> 01:05:58,644
together.

1073
01:05:58,710 --> 01:06:03,710
My first thought was she didn't like them
face to face or maybe she was the size

1074
01:06:04,260 --> 01:06:07,650
was the size of my staff
that she didn't like.

1075
01:06:08,100 --> 01:06:09,330
It's not live very long,

1076
01:06:09,331 --> 01:06:13,530
but I am girthy and that's fine with me.

1077
01:06:14,280 --> 01:06:18,180
I like to make the joke. I may not be
able to touch the bottom of the tuna can,

1078
01:06:18,210 --> 01:06:19,890
but I can touch all the sides.

1079
01:06:22,140 --> 01:06:22,973
MMM.

1080
01:06:24,010 --> 01:06:25,210
Long story short.

1081
01:06:26,330 --> 01:06:26,590
Yeah.

1082
01:06:26,590 --> 01:06:30,520
She's asked slash demanded that I
get surgery to remove the excess.

1083
01:06:30,550 --> 01:06:33,940
I don't know how to take that.
Isn't love beyond the physical.

1084
01:06:34,540 --> 01:06:37,660
Thank you very much built. Um,
I'll tell you this right now.

1085
01:06:37,790 --> 01:06:41,230
There is no fucking way you could ever
tell your wife to do something like that.

1086
01:06:43,450 --> 01:06:46,010
Um, I don't know what to tell you, dude.

1087
01:06:46,070 --> 01:06:49,220
You need to talk to a professional
about this one. I can tell you this.

1088
01:06:49,221 --> 01:06:52,690
If someone was going to make me
remove something from my Dick, uh,

1089
01:06:52,730 --> 01:06:56,540
they would have to be in writing a
guaranteed number of blow jobs per month.

1090
01:06:57,800 --> 01:06:58,900
Here's the thing, dude, what do you,

1091
01:06:58,901 --> 01:07:01,760
if you do that and then she
still doesn't like your Dick,

1092
01:07:02,940 --> 01:07:06,810
you know there's been women that married
guys and then they get divorced and

1093
01:07:06,811 --> 01:07:10,020
then all of a sudden they have a
girlfriend. You find out they're gay.

1094
01:07:10,650 --> 01:07:14,130
Anything can fucking happen before
you start cutting shit off your Dick.

1095
01:07:14,131 --> 01:07:16,440
Fuck that. That Shit
Dick. I wouldn't do it.

1096
01:07:17,680 --> 01:07:18,513
I wouldn't do it.

1097
01:07:21,230 --> 01:07:23,930
I wouldn't do it. And I think it's
really fucked up that you know

1098
01:07:25,640 --> 01:07:27,640
that she married you.
If she was looking,

1099
01:07:29,490 --> 01:07:32,640
if she fucking went on a date with you
and the first time you took out your

1100
01:07:32,641 --> 01:07:35,190
little fucking a stumpy fifth thing there.

1101
01:07:36,940 --> 01:07:37,773
Aye

1102
01:07:38,290 --> 01:07:39,580
Is.
She should have been honest with the,

1103
01:07:39,581 --> 01:07:43,480
instead of fucking gross me out and
you guys could have left it at that.

1104
01:07:45,530 --> 01:07:47,780
Now she's two years into this shit.
This is,

1105
01:07:47,781 --> 01:07:52,781
this is all her fault for not fucking
communicating to you that she thinks

1106
01:07:53,610 --> 01:07:55,520
should dick is gross. And I'm
to tell you right now, dude,

1107
01:07:55,550 --> 01:07:58,670
do not fucking do that on any
level. Fuck you. This is my Dick.

1108
01:07:58,671 --> 01:08:01,850
This is the deck I showed up with and
this is the deck I'm leaving with.

1109
01:08:02,900 --> 01:08:03,733
Okay.

1110
01:08:05,300 --> 01:08:09,620
And if she walks, she fucking walks, dude.
Fuck that. I'm telling you right now.

1111
01:08:09,621 --> 01:08:14,030
Don't do it. I got a bag.
I remember platoon. I got a
bad feeling about this one,

1112
01:08:14,031 --> 01:08:15,710
man.
I got a bad feeling this

1113
01:08:19,590 --> 01:08:22,800
could you say to her, you
know, uh, you know, you're
fucking, I don't view your tits.

1114
01:08:22,801 --> 01:08:27,370
Gross me out.
I Dunno.

1115
01:08:28,990 --> 01:08:33,440
I Dunno man. I wouldn't do it.
Don't fucking do it. That's,

1116
01:08:33,441 --> 01:08:38,140
that's my advice. Do not do it. Keep
your dick all original matching numbers,

1117
01:08:38,141 --> 01:08:42,430
barn fine. Uh, Bruins. Almost
scored in that fucking breakaway.

1118
01:08:42,460 --> 01:08:46,690
God dammit. Then almost go had
a breakaway but did not score.

1119
01:08:47,540 --> 01:08:51,910
All right. Advice friend is,
isn't prison. Hey Billy boullion.

1120
01:08:52,540 --> 01:08:54,850
I have a huge problem that
needs some need. Your advice?

1121
01:08:54,851 --> 01:08:59,851
A friend of mine whom I've known since
the late nineties recently went to

1122
01:09:01,031 --> 01:09:04,690
prison. He was a great guy, funny guy.

1123
01:09:04,990 --> 01:09:06,760
And we have the same sense of humor.

1124
01:09:06,761 --> 01:09:11,140
We've stayed in touch for almost two
decades, sharing life's adventures,

1125
01:09:11,141 --> 01:09:12,970
family stories,
joys and sorrows.

1126
01:09:13,240 --> 01:09:16,690
So it was met with sadness when he emailed
me a few months ago to explain that

1127
01:09:16,691 --> 01:09:21,400
he was experiencing serious legal trouble.
They had a potential decade in prison.

1128
01:09:21,430 --> 01:09:25,480
Well, what did he do? Tax
evasion. Embezzlement.

1129
01:09:25,960 --> 01:09:30,670
He said he wasn't able to explain the
details of the case. Uh, touch somebody.

1130
01:09:31,060 --> 01:09:35,440
I emailed him back a week later to hope
things worked out, whatever it was.

1131
01:09:35,441 --> 01:09:39,670
I said I didn't need to know the
details because I believed he was a good

1132
01:09:39,671 --> 01:09:44,490
character.
Eventually his wife responded and said,

1133
01:09:44,550 --> 01:09:47,580
he's in prison. She offered to put
me in contact with them. All right,

1134
01:09:47,581 --> 01:09:49,660
well then he didn't touch somebody
if she's still fucking there.

1135
01:09:49,730 --> 01:09:53,820
And that's my guess,
eight 36 to go.

1136
01:09:56,580 --> 01:10:00,890
Um, all right, so until, uh,

1137
01:10:01,460 --> 01:10:06,460
today I kept in contact through the prison
email service and he's been friendly

1138
01:10:07,521 --> 01:10:08,210
and upbeat.

1139
01:10:08,210 --> 01:10:12,350
I didn't ask about his situation because
I thought that whatever he did can't be

1140
01:10:12,351 --> 01:10:16,460
that bad and he won't want to talk
about you is going to jail for 10 years.

1141
01:10:16,461 --> 01:10:21,230
He did fucking did something. Guys don't
talk about emotional stuff. After all,

1142
01:10:21,231 --> 01:10:24,020
I told him to stay positive and
just get through it the best he can.

1143
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:26,240
I wanted to show him
pictures of my new car,

1144
01:10:26,241 --> 01:10:28,190
but the prison email can't do attachment,

1145
01:10:28,460 --> 01:10:32,290
so I asked my partner about
posting some photos. She go,

1146
01:10:32,360 --> 01:10:36,950
this president site, it's a federal
prison. She asked me what he's in for.

1147
01:10:37,970 --> 01:10:41,060
I honestly said, I don't know,
and she started snooping.

1148
01:10:43,340 --> 01:10:44,173
Oh boy.

1149
01:10:45,340 --> 01:10:47,590
Then we found a new story from town.

1150
01:10:47,890 --> 01:10:51,460
He pled guilty to having
thousands of Kiddie porn pictures.

1151
01:10:51,461 --> 01:10:55,390
There it is on his computer.
It's 100% him, no doubt.

1152
01:10:55,600 --> 01:10:57,520
Not a case of mistaken identity.

1153
01:10:57,730 --> 01:11:01,300
I feel so dumb for not googling
his name months ago. So bill,

1154
01:11:01,301 --> 01:11:03,070
my question is what do I do?

1155
01:11:03,820 --> 01:11:06,760
The easy answer is to ignore
him and cut him out of my life.

1156
01:11:07,090 --> 01:11:09,670
That was my first thought,
but I'm also human and he's alone.

1157
01:11:09,671 --> 01:11:10,780
Sitting in a prison cell,

1158
01:11:10,781 --> 01:11:15,781
realizing his mistake is possible to
someone still be a friend to this guy.

1159
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:22,920
Can pedophiles change as far as
I've seen? No, not even remotely.

1160
01:11:22,921 --> 01:11:25,350
Could you somehow change
what you're attracted to?

1161
01:11:26,490 --> 01:11:28,260
You're attracted to what
you're attracted to.

1162
01:11:29,460 --> 01:11:31,920
I don't want to lose my friend
because I don't have many,

1163
01:11:31,921 --> 01:11:35,130
but he did unforgivable things.
I feel let down.

1164
01:11:35,131 --> 01:11:39,120
But he supported me as a friend
for 20 years. What do I do? Well,

1165
01:11:39,121 --> 01:11:40,890
I think you just answered it.
You,

1166
01:11:40,920 --> 01:11:45,310
you're a good friend
and he's a good friend.

1167
01:11:46,630 --> 01:11:50,470
But, uh, you just said what he did was
unforgivable. So if it's unforgivable,

1168
01:11:50,471 --> 01:11:51,460
you can't forgive him.

1169
01:11:53,670 --> 01:11:54,380
MMM.

1170
01:11:54,380 --> 01:11:58,730
I Dunno dude. I'm sorry. Go through. It's
pretty heavy fucking email. As a father,

1171
01:11:58,731 --> 01:12:01,370
it's easy to just cut them out of
your life too. You're a father,

1172
01:12:01,371 --> 01:12:03,170
you have kids yet you got
to get rid of this guy.

1173
01:12:04,120 --> 01:12:06,830
You gotta get rid of them anyways.
But imagine if you can,

1174
01:12:06,860 --> 01:12:09,830
if one of your good friends did this,
I can't forgive him.

1175
01:12:09,831 --> 01:12:12,110
But this moral ethical
decision is killing me.

1176
01:12:12,410 --> 01:12:14,870
Thank you very much for your
time and go fuck yourself.

1177
01:12:14,930 --> 01:12:17,000
The last email was long and takes a turn.

1178
01:12:17,001 --> 01:12:19,610
Wasn't sure if you want to read it or not,
but I threw it in there.

1179
01:12:19,700 --> 01:12:24,080
That's hilarious. He sent that
after he's after the email text.

1180
01:12:26,480 --> 01:12:29,120
Um, yeah. Uh,

1181
01:12:29,510 --> 01:12:34,510
if you think you owe it to him
as a friend to explain why.

1182
01:12:38,440 --> 01:12:39,273
MMM,

1183
01:12:39,460 --> 01:12:43,510
I would do that. But yeah, it's,
it's a rap and then I would just,

1184
01:12:44,170 --> 01:12:45,310
if you feel bad about it,

1185
01:12:45,311 --> 01:12:48,190
I would just talk to my wife about her
or if you feel you need to go talk to

1186
01:12:48,191 --> 01:12:53,160
somebody about it, I would do that.
Um, but dude, you got kids. You May,

1187
01:12:53,230 --> 01:12:54,970
you know those people that are sick,

1188
01:12:54,971 --> 01:12:57,100
there's something wrong with them when
they haven't been able to figure out how

1189
01:12:57,101 --> 01:12:59,230
to fix them. And you got to
protect yourself and your family.

1190
01:12:59,231 --> 01:13:03,550
So sometimes you know,
you got to choose yourself.

1191
01:13:03,551 --> 01:13:06,460
And I think this is an easy one.
You said it yourself.

1192
01:13:06,461 --> 01:13:10,360
What he did was unforgivable. All
right. That is the podcast. All right.

1193
01:13:11,170 --> 01:13:15,160
You guys have a great couple of days here
and I'll check in on you on Thursday.

1194
01:13:16,360 --> 01:13:19,930
Um, those of you who want to listen to
the final five minutes and nine, eight,

1195
01:13:19,960 --> 01:13:24,370
seven seconds of this fucking game,
uh,

1196
01:13:24,371 --> 01:13:26,890
you can listen to the rest
of this fucking podcast.

1197
01:13:27,740 --> 01:13:28,573
Yeah.

1198
01:13:29,150 --> 01:13:32,340
All right. Now we're in, now
we're in overtime for the podcast.

1199
01:13:32,640 --> 01:13:37,620
Get fucking so Dadi sleeping.
Just screamed and I yelled the f word.

1200
01:13:39,950 --> 01:13:43,280
Oh, Toronto is on the edge
of their fucking seats here.

1201
01:13:47,110 --> 01:13:47,520
I love going.

1202
01:13:47,520 --> 01:13:50,160
They keep fucking Shannon Tucows name
like Keith that's going to rattle him.

1203
01:13:50,161 --> 01:13:53,550
He's been playing great.
They scored on a deflection.

1204
01:13:54,890 --> 01:13:55,723
Do you know,

1205
01:13:58,560 --> 01:14:03,420
can't blame a goalie for
a deflection. Um, men,

1206
01:14:03,421 --> 01:14:06,570
the second one was a nice goal.
I could live with both of those,

1207
01:14:06,571 --> 01:14:09,750
especially if they don't score another
one bro and spring in the pocket to the

1208
01:14:10,090 --> 01:14:11,400
Czar God,
down half wall

1209
01:14:12,220 --> 01:14:14,320
retina by some con from Toronto.

1210
01:14:16,040 --> 01:14:20,810
Why didn't you fucking
Ah,

1211
01:14:20,811 --> 01:14:25,400
Jesus? Now they've got to
clear the zone. Oh my God,

1212
01:14:26,760 --> 01:14:29,730
it was right there. You know what
happens when you miss one of those?

1213
01:14:29,731 --> 01:14:33,980
The other team fucking scores.
Jesus Christ

1214
01:14:36,400 --> 01:14:40,360
to viruses. Matthews out there too.
They're on a different line. Thank Christ.

1215
01:14:40,630 --> 01:14:42,760
You know at the end of the game,
that bolt's going to be out there.

1216
01:14:43,120 --> 01:14:46,820
The fucking goalie pulled. Why
do I do this? Why don't, why?

1217
01:14:46,821 --> 01:14:51,040
Why do I give a shit? You know?
Look at his asshole standing up.

1218
01:14:51,041 --> 01:14:52,450
Get the fuck out of the way.

1219
01:15:00,250 --> 01:15:03,670
Oh, look at that sweet rebound. Just
sitting there waiting to be picked up.

1220
01:15:07,870 --> 01:15:09,430
Let me turn this up so
you can at least hear it.

1221
01:15:10,540 --> 01:15:11,373
Okay.

1222
01:15:18,920 --> 01:15:20,690
Three Oh nine ago,
three Oh eight to go.

1223
01:15:24,710 --> 01:15:27,290
Yeah. You know you want to game seven
right? Tell me you want to game seven.

1224
01:15:28,400 --> 01:15:29,750
That's right.
Two one one

1225
01:15:31,600 --> 01:15:32,433
oh,

1226
01:15:36,590 --> 01:15:38,260
action.
Dapa down the ice.

1227
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:40,833
Okay.

1228
01:15:44,440 --> 01:15:48,610
Yeah. Calm the Bruins. Here come the
Bruins. There comes one borough in any way

1229
01:15:51,790 --> 01:15:54,730
for a stoppage of play to 38 to go.

1230
01:15:58,430 --> 01:16:02,460
He just goes, it's wonderful, isn't it?
Now if your heart's in a fucking game,

1231
01:16:03,680 --> 01:16:06,280
it's wonderful.
If you don't give a shit about,

1232
01:16:06,400 --> 01:16:08,240
I'm a Calgary flames fan
and I'm watching this.

1233
01:16:08,241 --> 01:16:10,730
I'm fucking probably having a good
time cause my team's already out of it.

1234
01:16:12,890 --> 01:16:16,880
Ah, boy. You know what I didn't take
into consideration here is commercials.

1235
01:16:16,910 --> 01:16:19,280
You guys watching the Lexus
going around the race track?

1236
01:16:20,870 --> 01:16:25,700
Lexis is a great car for the
money. Huh? I'd like to think so.

1237
01:16:27,680 --> 01:16:28,980
Was that shot in areas?
Um,

1238
01:16:29,240 --> 01:16:33,380
in Australia they give me some militant
vegans running out in front of them

1239
01:16:35,030 --> 01:16:39,950
because the fucking,
I'm so glad they moved onto this guy.

1240
01:16:40,790 --> 01:16:43,250
This progressive commercials
is progressive. What is this?

1241
01:16:43,520 --> 01:16:47,690
The guy with the parrot, I couldn't stand
that one with that Asian chick going,

1242
01:16:48,340 --> 01:16:52,550
Woo. How? Like what the fuck was that for?

1243
01:16:52,551 --> 01:16:54,530
White person did that,
that you'd be in trouble.

1244
01:16:59,850 --> 01:16:59,930
Okay.

1245
01:16:59,930 --> 01:17:02,600
Ooh, child. All right.

1246
01:17:05,250 --> 01:17:10,020
No, I hit pause. Then they got
a black guy dancing with food at

1247
01:17:10,070 --> 01:17:12,080
Tgi Fridays. We what?
What is, what is going on?

1248
01:17:12,081 --> 01:17:13,820
It's like progressive
and then it goes back.

1249
01:17:16,980 --> 01:17:17,980
All right.

1250
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:25,833
Okay.

1251
01:17:26,330 --> 01:17:28,370
Real estate.
Everybody's doing commercial stuff.

1252
01:17:31,210 --> 01:17:34,540
There's more celebrities and commercials
in there are super hero movies,

1253
01:17:34,541 --> 01:17:36,970
you know. All right. Back to the game.

1254
01:17:46,310 --> 01:17:47,840
Challis McAvoy getting a skate on that.

1255
01:17:48,650 --> 01:17:49,483
Okay.

1256
01:17:54,840 --> 01:17:58,620
How the fuck did Matthew's miss that?
Because probably in the year,

1257
01:17:58,680 --> 01:17:59,820
I know it wasn't his fault

1258
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:06,580
and Nakira fucking gold score.
He's fucking imitating crazy there.

1259
01:18:10,700 --> 01:18:11,533
Okay.

1260
01:18:12,410 --> 01:18:13,910
Innocent big time saves.
You know what else he has?

1261
01:18:13,911 --> 01:18:17,900
He has big time rebounds and I got it.
Thank y'all bro.

1262
01:18:18,070 --> 01:18:21,470
Ones are going to be there to pick one up.
Come on.

1263
01:18:21,890 --> 01:18:26,120
Come on Bruins till 36 to 35

1264
01:18:29,620 --> 01:18:34,060
there you go. Keep it near
end. Cycle it around dog.

1265
01:18:36,920 --> 01:18:38,060
Half Wall.

1266
01:18:42,430 --> 01:18:46,600
Come on. Come on. You fuckers.

1267
01:18:47,990 --> 01:18:48,823
Yeah.

1268
01:18:51,770 --> 01:18:53,960
Oh Jesus.
Oh Jesus.

1269
01:18:55,850 --> 01:18:59,750
Get it out of there.
The fuck are we doing two minutes to go

1270
01:19:02,180 --> 01:19:04,010
through the fucking Toronto
scores and found two minutes.

1271
01:19:04,011 --> 01:19:05,450
I'm shutting this fucking thing off.

1272
01:19:11,060 --> 01:19:14,480
Ah, game seven everybody. Oh my God.

1273
01:19:14,481 --> 01:19:16,190
Listen to how fucking quiet is in there.

1274
01:19:18,350 --> 01:19:22,030
Why the fuck did they pull the goalie?
You're only down by one goal. I don't,

1275
01:19:22,031 --> 01:19:26,370
I don't fucking get debt,
but the minutes ago maybe.

1276
01:19:27,370 --> 01:19:28,203
Yes.

1277
01:19:33,320 --> 01:19:35,750
Fucking Marshawn man.
He's the best.

1278
01:19:40,040 --> 01:19:40,873
Okay.

1279
01:19:40,910 --> 01:19:44,140
He's the best deck. He's just
fucking money. He's just money.

1280
01:19:46,270 --> 01:19:46,450
Yeah.

1281
01:19:46,450 --> 01:19:50,000
Oh, all the Bruins to score for
Toronto fans to get pissed off at

1282
01:19:54,930 --> 01:19:59,490
all. Right. Not a respect for the Toronto
Maple leafs. I watched the rest of this

1283
01:20:01,880 --> 01:20:04,860
may believe. Fan staying there.
Look at this. Very impressive.

1284
01:20:05,160 --> 01:20:08,730
What a fan base like those
Montreal Canadien fans.

1285
01:20:08,731 --> 01:20:13,140
They would all fucking take it off.
Oh,

1286
01:20:13,230 --> 01:20:15,510
is that a tripping call?
What?

1287
01:20:18,430 --> 01:20:19,300
Just white?

1288
01:20:25,510 --> 01:20:26,343
Yeah.

1289
01:20:28,090 --> 01:20:29,830
Minute 22 to go.

1290
01:20:32,160 --> 01:20:36,990
The always dangerous Austin
Matthews. All right. Out of the zone.

1291
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:41,250
I can never skate like then. These
fucking guys, defense men are amazing.

1292
01:20:46,520 --> 01:20:50,360
That fucking asshole sat down. Didn't
he? Down by two goals? Probably left.

1293
01:20:52,880 --> 01:20:53,490
Yeah.

1294
01:20:53,490 --> 01:20:55,020
Get it out of there.

1295
01:20:56,910 --> 01:21:01,380
Get it out of there, please. Ah,

1296
01:21:01,400 --> 01:21:03,960
fuck. Not this guy. Not this guy.

1297
01:21:08,110 --> 01:21:08,943
Yeah.

1298
01:21:09,110 --> 01:21:10,850
You know somebody who's
got this fucking game,

1299
01:21:10,851 --> 01:21:13,250
that gambling and they gonna
fucking pull the goalie like this.

1300
01:21:16,570 --> 01:21:20,680
Don't they care about gamblers? Aw, look
at that. Just swallowed it up. No rebound.

1301
01:21:20,710 --> 01:21:21,543
Unlike Anderson.

1302
01:21:23,500 --> 01:21:23,930
Yeah.

1303
01:21:23,930 --> 01:21:27,980
Oh, we got a game. Seven.
We got a game. Seven.

1304
01:21:29,580 --> 01:21:29,670
Yeah.

1305
01:21:29,670 --> 01:21:30,930
Look at that fucking pass.

1306
01:21:34,080 --> 01:21:34,950
Unbelievable.

1307
01:21:38,420 --> 01:21:42,050
Tuukka Rask is always there. Yeah.
Chan his name now. Toronto fans.

1308
01:21:42,620 --> 01:21:43,970
Jan His fucking name now,

1309
01:21:45,910 --> 01:21:48,250
not by any means saying we're going
to win this series. I'm just saying,

1310
01:21:48,251 --> 01:21:49,590
I'm just glad it's going to go seven here.

1311
01:21:50,270 --> 01:21:51,103
Okay.

1312
01:21:51,170 --> 01:21:56,090
Huge. Like a Babcock.
What a great coach. Callow

1313
01:21:58,960 --> 01:21:59,793
yeah,

1314
01:22:01,960 --> 01:22:04,870
what exactly is saying there's 31
fucking seconds left, you know.

1315
01:22:07,120 --> 01:22:07,150
Alright.

1316
01:22:07,150 --> 01:22:12,150
If he could score on a face off in the
zone and then somehow after the face off,

1317
01:22:13,930 --> 01:22:17,500
yeah, you can score at the
red line. Can we do that then?

1318
01:22:17,501 --> 01:22:19,720
Maybe score again and we can get
out of here. Not going to overtime.

1319
01:22:21,730 --> 01:22:22,563
Yeah.

1320
01:22:23,430 --> 01:22:24,263
Uh,

1321
01:22:25,610 --> 01:22:28,470
[inaudible] Boston Bruins
back out to center ice.

1322
01:22:30,210 --> 01:22:30,540
Yeah.

1323
01:22:30,540 --> 01:22:34,550
Hi. How many times can they be Toronto
in a fucking playoff series when we'll

1324
01:22:34,551 --> 01:22:39,551
Toronto get the fucking first
round monkey off their back.

1325
01:22:41,870 --> 01:22:45,230
I'm not going to lie to you. I thought
they had us. I thought they had us,

1326
01:22:46,280 --> 01:22:47,900
especially the first 10
minutes of this game.

1327
01:22:48,740 --> 01:22:51,620
And that's why I'm not a professional
athlete because I am a quitter.

1328
01:22:52,910 --> 01:22:55,370
And you'll Boston Bruins do not quit.
Fuck.

1329
01:22:56,570 --> 01:23:01,110
Why is Austin Matthews always on the side
of the side of the fucking net within

1330
01:23:01,290 --> 01:23:02,390
the two cars?
On the other side,

1331
01:23:02,391 --> 01:23:04,190
just just sitting there
with his stick on the ice.

1332
01:23:06,420 --> 01:23:09,870
16.7 seconds to go near.
There's gotta be a game. Seven.

1333
01:23:11,070 --> 01:23:11,770
Perfect.

1334
01:23:11,770 --> 01:23:14,800
All right. You don't have to listen
to the final 16.7 seconds. All right,

1335
01:23:14,801 --> 01:23:18,580
everybody, thank you for listening to
the bonus time here on the podcast.

1336
01:23:18,970 --> 01:23:22,570
Congratulations to the Bruins.
Animate believes great playoff series.

1337
01:23:22,571 --> 01:23:27,370
Who knows who's going to win,
but a game seven is on Tuesday,

1338
01:23:27,371 --> 01:23:28,390
14 seconds.

1339
01:23:33,370 --> 01:23:37,210
(312) 111-0987 fucking icing again.
Jesus fucking Christ.

1340
01:23:38,930 --> 01:23:43,430
5.4 now I've got to stick it out,
right? Said I was going to stick it out.

1341
01:23:44,770 --> 01:23:44,850
Okay.

1342
01:23:44,850 --> 01:23:47,220
You don't. Yeah, you know me, right
when I say I'm going to stick it out,

1343
01:23:47,221 --> 01:23:48,600
I stick it out,
right?

1344
01:23:51,730 --> 01:23:53,140
Didn't that used to be my bathrobe?

1345
01:23:55,770 --> 01:23:58,980
It used to be.
It used to be my bathrobe

1346
01:24:00,970 --> 01:24:02,710
and then she took it.

1347
01:24:04,700 --> 01:24:05,533
Look at this guy

1348
01:24:06,620 --> 01:24:09,230
fucking referee.
Bet the over as far as time goes.

1349
01:24:09,560 --> 01:24:12,680
How long this game would take
kicking people out of a face,

1350
01:24:12,681 --> 01:24:16,310
off fucking 5.4 seconds left. 42
game. There you go. That's the

1351
01:24:17,900 --> 01:24:20,600
ballgame. Fucking huge, huge victory.

1352
01:24:20,601 --> 01:24:23,660
Congratulations to your Boston Bruins.
All right.

1353
01:24:23,690 --> 01:24:25,190
I'll check in on you on Thursday.
