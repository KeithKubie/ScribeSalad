1
00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:02.700
Where do you see this going?

2
00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:04.950
When you look at these kinds of emerging technologies,

3
00:00:04.951 --> 00:00:09.490
not necessarily emerging anymore,
established now,
but still,
you know,
a,

4
00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:12.480
a new thing in relative terms of human history.

5
00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:16.320
Where do you see this going and does it get more intrusive?

6
00:00:16.321 --> 00:00:19.140
Does it get deeper into our lives?
Like what,
what,

7
00:00:19.141 --> 00:00:22.860
and when you look at new technologies like augmented reality and things on those

8
00:00:22.861 --> 00:00:23.490
lines,

9
00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.490
do you see new possibilities and new things that make things even more

10
00:00:28.711 --> 00:00:29.550
complicated?

11
00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:35.950
<v 1>I mean,
yeah.
I mean we just have to assume that we,</v>

12
00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:40.810
we naturally use more and more technologies,
more and more things become open,

13
00:00:40.811 --> 00:00:44.350
more and more things,
uh,
increase their velocity.

14
00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:49.040
There's more communication,
not less.
Like this is not going away and it's just,

15
00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:52.330
it's just a question of what we do with it.
So where,

16
00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:57.010
where I want it to go as and where I want Twitter specifically to go is I,

17
00:00:57.011 --> 00:01:01.330
you know,
I,
I think it's existential right now that we,

18
00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:02.060
we,

19
00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:07.060
we have global conversations about some things that will become crisis,

20
00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:09.970
climate change being one of them.

21
00:01:09.971 --> 00:01:13.270
There is no one nation state that's going to solve that problem alone.

22
00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:15.430
Economic disparity being another,

23
00:01:15.431 --> 00:01:18.940
the the rise of Ai and uh,

24
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.170
job displacement and just like us offloading decisions to these,

25
00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:27.970
to these algorithms,
those are the things that,
that no one nation,

26
00:01:27.971 --> 00:01:31.630
no one community is going to solve alone.
It takes the entire world to do so.

27
00:01:31.631 --> 00:01:36.631
So I want to make sure that we're doing our best to get people seeing these

28
00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.810
global conversations and ideally participating in them because it helps,

29
00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.570
it helps us solve the problems faster.

30
00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:48.580
I just believe that more open society allows us to solve problems much faster.

31
00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:55.760
<v 0>So you in many ways see Twitter is having some sort of a social responsibility</v>

32
00:01:56.041 --> 00:01:56.874
in this discussion.

33
00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:01.220
<v 1>Totally.
Totally.
Yeah.
And I think a big part of his,
like right now,</v>

34
00:02:01.221 --> 00:02:02.210
like how are we,

35
00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:07.270
how are we ensuring that there is more healthy contribution to that global

36
00:02:07.821 --> 00:02:11.990
conversation?
And you know,
I,
I just think it's,

37
00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.040
it's so critical that we start talking about the things that are facing all of

38
00:02:16.041 --> 00:02:18.110
us,
not just one nation.

39
00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:23.150
I do think you know that that's where our current model really puts the world at

40
00:02:24.561 --> 00:02:29.561
a disadvantage because it incentivizes more of the echo chambers,

41
00:02:29.871 --> 00:02:31.940
which lead to things like nationalism.

42
00:02:31.941 --> 00:02:36.170
Instead of taking the broader picture and looking at what's happening around the

43
00:02:36.171 --> 00:02:38.090
world to all people,
to all of humanity.

44
00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:43.170
<v 0>What do you do though to balance the conversation or what responsibility do you</v>

45
00:02:43.171 --> 00:02:46.350
think you have to balance the conversation in terms of the way conservatives

46
00:02:46.351 --> 00:02:49.080
view at versus the way liberals and progressives view it?

47
00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.070
Balance it shows there,
is there a responsibility,

48
00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:57.570
do you have responsibility or is it just leave it up to the people and let them

49
00:02:57.571 --> 00:02:59.740
figure it out the same way they figured out hashtags and,

50
00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:01.380
<v 1>and everything else.
I,</v>

51
00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.070
I think we have a responsibility to make it easier to do that easier.
How so?

52
00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:06.580
Right now it's just,
it's just too hard.

53
00:03:06.581 --> 00:03:11.290
Most most people will not venture off this other similar mindset.
They will,

54
00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:15.520
they will not venture out.
They will not break their bubble.
Um,
but if you,

55
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.100
because it's right now on the surface,
it's just so hard to do that.
I,

56
00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:21.970
I can only follow accounts and I have to,

57
00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:25.960
I have to look into and just imagine like,
you know,

58
00:03:25.961 --> 00:03:30.190
trying to get an understanding of your own politics.

59
00:03:30.191 --> 00:03:33.850
People can't just look at your bio,
they have to look through all your tweets,

60
00:03:33.851 --> 00:03:36.010
they have to listen to a bunch of your podcasts and whatnot.

61
00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:41.350
And that's a bunch of work.
If we shift it more towards topics and interest,

62
00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:46.540
at least we have the potential to see a bunch more perspectives.

63
00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:51.540
We see that though is the simplest thing as I follow hashtag follow a topic.

64
00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:56.150
Like why can't you just follow warrior's Twitter or uh,

65
00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:58.210
um,
you know,
NBA,
Twitter,

66
00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:02.210
why do you have to go and find all the coaches and the players and,

67
00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:04.960
and the team.
So we can do that.

68
00:04:04.961 --> 00:04:07.840
We can help make that a whole lot easier for folks.

69
00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:09.760
So there's something like Brexit or something like that.

70
00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:13.900
So if you go to Hashtag Brexit,
you're going to get the whole conversation,

71
00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.800
you're going to get the pros,
the cons,
the left,
the right,
the whole deal,

72
00:04:17.801 --> 00:04:21.460
the centrists you're going to get everybody versus following the people that you

73
00:04:21.461 --> 00:04:25.480
already follow that agree with what you think the probability is higher,

74
00:04:25.481 --> 00:04:26.590
that you'll get more,

75
00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:30.430
you'll get more variety perspective and not even doesn't even follow Brexit,

76
00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:32.230
follow vote leave if you want to leave.

77
00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:37.500
But within that topic there might be some dissenting opinions and you get to

78
00:04:37.661 --> 00:04:41.650
choose whether you,
those inform you,
whether that emboldens your position or not.

79
00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:45.580
But,
and,
and again,
I'm not saying that we should force that upon it,

80
00:04:45.581 --> 00:04:48.190
but it's not easy to even do that today.
Right?

81
00:04:48.191 --> 00:04:52.390
The only tool we give you is finding and following the accounts and that.

82
00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:55.990
But people search hashtags,
they do start trash.
They don't,

83
00:04:55.991 --> 00:04:58.720
they send their timeline.
I mean it is small percentage of people that,

84
00:04:58.721 --> 00:05:02.080
people that really know Twitter know how to do that.
But most people,

85
00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:07.180
they fall into account and they stand the timeline and what their world is,

86
00:05:07.181 --> 00:05:11.120
their timeline.
Hashtags can be corrupted to totally.
They can be gamed.

87
00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:13.030
It can be gamed and taken over.

88
00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:17.710
I took over Hashtag Vegan cat go to Hashtag [inaudible] in.
What is,
what is that?

89
00:05:17.711 --> 00:05:19.540
It's a wrap.
That's mine now.
