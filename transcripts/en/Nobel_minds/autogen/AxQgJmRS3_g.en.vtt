for biochemistry was to crush the cell

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:09.440
for biochemistry was to crush the cell
 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.980
for biochemistry was to crush the cell
extract it put into test tube and try to

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:11.990
extract it put into test tube and try to
 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:14.170
extract it put into test tube and try to
find out different reactions and so on

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:14.180
find out different reactions and so on
 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:16.359

but now you can label your protein of

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:16.369
but now you can label your protein of
 

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:18.190
but now you can label your protein of
interest very easily any students can do

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:18.200
interest very easily any students can do
 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.870
interest very easily any students can do
that and then you can start it what

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.880
that and then you can start it what
 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.670
that and then you can start it what
happens to the protein inside the living

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:21.680
happens to the protein inside the living
 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:23.800
happens to the protein inside the living
cell when the cell is born when it

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:23.810
cell when the cell is born when it
 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:26.109
cell when the cell is born when it
divides when it metabolizes and so on

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:26.119
divides when it metabolizes and so on
 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:28.690
divides when it metabolizes and so on
and that is a very good position you can

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:28.700
and that is a very good position you can
 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.760
and that is a very good position you can
look at the individual molecules and

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:30.770
look at the individual molecules and
 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:32.620
look at the individual molecules and
that has completely changed the field of

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:32.630
that has completely changed the field of
 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.219
that has completely changed the field of
biomedicine so this is a fluorescent tag

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:36.229
biomedicine so this is a fluorescent tag
 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:37.749
biomedicine so this is a fluorescent tag
or a marker that you can put on any

00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:37.759
or a marker that you can put on any
 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:38.679
or a marker that you can put on any
protein you're particularly interested

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:38.689
protein you're particularly interested
 

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:41.170
protein you're particularly interested
in and track its movement through cells

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:41.180
in and track its movement through cells
 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:43.510
in and track its movement through cells
over time through the course of an

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:43.520
over time through the course of an
 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:44.530
over time through the course of an
organism yeah

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:44.540
organism yeah
 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:48.430
organism yeah
right and so this is obviously expanded

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:48.440
right and so this is obviously expanded
 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:50.920
right and so this is obviously expanded
the world of that we can see it within

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:50.930
the world of that we can see it within
 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:52.750
the world of that we can see it within
cells could you give us an example of

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:52.760
cells could you give us an example of
 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:55.930
cells could you give us an example of
what we can now see thanks to gfp when

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:55.940
what we can now see thanks to gfp when
 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:57.850
what we can now see thanks to gfp when
they shown in the introduction here for

example what happens when HIV viruses

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.140
example what happens when HIV viruses
 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.500
example what happens when HIV viruses
infects a cell and when the cells don't

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:02.510
infects a cell and when the cells don't
 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:04.630
infects a cell and when the cells don't
reproduce new bars because we can lay

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640
reproduce new bars because we can lay
 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.610
reproduce new bars because we can lay
with the coat protein of the virus with

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:06.620
with the coat protein of the virus with
 

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:09.790
with the coat protein of the virus with
gfp and then you infect the cell and you

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:09.800
gfp and then you infect the cell and you
 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.640
gfp and then you infect the cell and you
can see first how the cell is diffusely

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650
can see first how the cell is diffusely
 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.920
can see first how the cell is diffusely
green but then with time you see small

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930
green but then with time you see small
 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:17.350
green but then with time you see small
very green spots that assembles wrote

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360
very green spots that assembles wrote
 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.510
very green spots that assembles wrote
the same that the new virus is a form

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:19.520
the same that the new virus is a form
 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:22.449
the same that the new virus is a form
and you can done in real time follow how

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:22.459
and you can done in real time follow how
 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:24.520
and you can done in real time follow how
fast they are built and how this

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530
fast they are built and how this
 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.500
fast they are built and how this
assembly is made and then of course you

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510
assembly is made and then of course you
 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:28.740
assembly is made and then of course you
can start to understand how you put

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750
can start to understand how you put
 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:31.840
can start to understand how you put

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:47.110
it so he started to isolate it start to
collect this money and it sucked Loria

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120
collect this money and it sucked Loria
 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:50.720
collect this money and it sucked Loria
victoria it is the jellyfish so he

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:50.730
victoria it is the jellyfish so he
 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:52.759
victoria it is the jellyfish so he
collected hundreds and hundreds of this

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:52.769
collected hundreds and hundreds of this
 

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:56.150
collected hundreds and hundreds of this
yellow fish in the friday harbor at the

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.160
yellow fish in the friday harbor at the
 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.340
yellow fish in the friday harbor at the
west coast of america and then they cut

00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:58.350
west coast of america and then they cut
 

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:01.130
west coast of america and then they cut
out the light organs that are deserted

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:01.140
out the light organs that are deserted
 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:03.199
out the light organs that are deserted
the borders of the yellow fish and

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:03.209
the borders of the yellow fish and
 

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:05.000
the borders of the yellow fish and
collected lots and lots of these and

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.010
collected lots and lots of these and
 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:08.210
collected lots and lots of these and
extracted them and purified the enzyme

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.220
extracted them and purified the enzyme
 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:10.759
extracted them and purified the enzyme
that was responsible for their for the

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:10.769
that was responsible for their for the
 

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:13.370
that was responsible for their for the
light emission and then you could show

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:13.380
light emission and then you could show
 

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:15.710
light emission and then you could show
that if you look at the sea you can see

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:15.720
that if you look at the sea you can see
 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:18.349
that if you look at the sea you can see
that the jellyfish has a green

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:18.359
that the jellyfish has a green
 

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:20.750
that the jellyfish has a green
fluorescent light but when you isolated

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:20.760
fluorescent light but when you isolated
 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:23.810
fluorescent light but when you isolated
this by illumination enzyme you got the

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:23.820
this by illumination enzyme you got the
 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:25.550
this by illumination enzyme you got the
blue line so obviously something was

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:25.560
blue line so obviously something was
 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.500
blue line so obviously something was
missing and then he looked again and he

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:27.510
missing and then he looked again and he
 

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:28.909
missing and then he looked again and he
found this green fluorescent protein

00:04:28.909 --> 00:04:28.919
found this green fluorescent protein
 

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:32.240
found this green fluorescent protein
that transfers the blue light into green

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:32.250
that transfers the blue light into green
 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:34.159
that transfers the blue light into green
light and that must be an advantage for

00:04:34.159 --> 00:04:34.169
light and that must be an advantage for
 

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:35.810
light and that must be an advantage for
the yellow fish maybe you can see them

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:35.820
the yellow fish maybe you can see them
 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:38.300
the yellow fish maybe you can see them
in longer distance you can tell it apart

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:38.310
in longer distance you can tell it apart
 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:40.300
in longer distance you can tell it apart
from other fishes

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:40.310
from other fishes
 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:43.750

and then off so so he really isolating
the green fluorescent protein made the

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:45.710
the green fluorescent protein made the
 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:48.130
the green fluorescent protein made the
manor sequence amino acid sequence of it

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:48.140

stable and so on but he made mutations

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:23.410
stable and so on but he made mutations
 

00:07:23.410 --> 00:07:26.700
stable and so on but he made mutations
in it and then developed it into a very

00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:26.710
in it and then developed it into a very
 

00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:28.800
in it and then developed it into a very
good tool that anybody can use and he

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:28.810
good tool that anybody can use and he
 

00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:30.870

you have all the ways from blue to red

00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:34.480
you have all the ways from blue to red
 

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:36.300
you have all the ways from blue to red
and that's important when you want to

00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:36.310
and that's important when you want to
 

00:07:36.310 --> 00:07:38.160
and that's important when you want to
start in many proteins at the same time

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:38.170
