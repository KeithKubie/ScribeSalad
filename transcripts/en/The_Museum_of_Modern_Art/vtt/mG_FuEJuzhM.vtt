00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:08.200
Osman: We're looking at an ad from the Sunday
Chicago Tribune from July 8th, 1917, actually.

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:12.889
And this is of a house that is, according
to the caption, being built.

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:17.500
And then there's a huge headline that says:
“You can own an American home.”

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:18.910
So, striking headline.

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:23.170
Osman: I think it's important to think about
the fact that “You can own an American home”

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:27.520
is in every newspaper that circulated throughout
the Chicago area.

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:34.010
So anybody who picks up that newspaper is
being addressed by this sentence but furthermore,

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:38.879
they're being told that they cannot just own
an American home but distinctly American architecture

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.620
by a distinct American architect.

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.319
Probably the most famous architect of that
time, 1917, Frank Lloyd Wright.

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:51.031
On the shop drawings and on the folio that
was published by the Richards Company, every

00:00:51.031 --> 00:00:57.780
drawing that we saw said, usually in the lower
right, patent applied for which for us was

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:04.600
a clue that Wright was interested in interfacing
with industry and creating intellectual property

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.130
from his designs.

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:14.649
And typically a work of art will be copyrighted
but an invention is something that you patent.

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:18.649
So it was an interesting idea to think about
architecture as something that you could patent.

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:22.210
Skjonsberg: I think the point is since the
beginning of his career, Wright has been very

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:25.820
interested in how the machine can be an emancipatory
thing.

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:28.649
That this is the forerunner of democracy as
he calls it.

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:34.030
So the evils that are experienced through
industrial process talking about inequity

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:38.390
in labor or ecological degradation which was
already apparent at that time.

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:44.149
So, he was interested in architect as an artist
being able to harness this emancipatory quality

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:46.299
of the machine and bring that to everyone.

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:48.320
Everyone who picks up a paper, as it turns
out.

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:55.109
Osman: I think what's important about having
a factory built house is that in order to

00:01:55.109 --> 00:02:01.299
get the common person, as it were, to have
access to a house, you'd need to reduce the

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:05.510
cost of the labor that it would take to make
that house.

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:10.039
So engaging the factory meant that you could
reduce the amount of labor that was on the

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:11.290
job site.

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:16.430
So for Wright, engaging in the factory was
really about democratizing access to houses

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:20.330
more generally but also, of course, to his
own authored beautiful houses.

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:26.430
Osman: So in the nineteen teens, when he's
approached by the Richards Company, the labor

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:31.980
market is very expensive in the U.S. and as
a result, engaging in factory labor would

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:33.430
have made sense.

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:40.610
By the 1930s, during the Great Depression,
the labor is very cheap.

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:49.540
So Wright moves away from factory made houses
precisely because he can make houses as he

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:55.390
always wanted to in the most beautifully crafted
way possible with intricate and incredibly

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:57.230
beautiful details.

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:01.989
The difference between the prefabricated house
made in the factory and the houses that we're

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:07.670
looking at here is that these houses were
made actually by master craftsmen.

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:14.510
The idea was to capitalize on the cheap labor
market during the Great Depression and give

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:20.769
access to people who, otherwise, wouldn't
have access to Frank Lloyd Wright homes to

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:28.829
a system of houses that he called Usonian
which would populate the entire continent

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:30.000
of the United States.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.439
Skjonsberg: So this brings us maybe from the
houses that were built in wood to those that

00:03:34.439 --> 00:03:36.599
were built in concrete.

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:40.849
The Usonian automatic system which was intended
to be built of concrete blocks.

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:45.610
And these were intended to be made by the
home builders themselves from the soil coming

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:47.440
from their own property.

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:52.019
So the intention was and several of these
houses were made that way that the clients,

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:55.329
usually husband and wife, would work together
making the blocks.

00:03:55.329 --> 00:03:58.939
They would work together establishing the
slab for the house.

00:03:58.939 --> 00:04:04.890
These vertical rods were situated at regular
intervals at two foot on center around the

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:05.910
perimeter.

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:11.110
The blocks were slid down onto these rods
and as subsequent courses were laid up, horizontal

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:12.500
rods were also inserted.

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:17.160
This was a definitely a paradigm shift that
it goes away from industrialized products

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:20.740
to locally sourced site specific mode of production.

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:25.490
Skjonsberg: I think Wright was concerned about
the role of architecture in society.

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:29.900
He was ambitious that architecture not be
lost as a cultural force.

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:37.020
And so his ambition for first systems and
then for standards were all in a way were

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:41.889
guided by the ambition that it be something
that's a cultural force.

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:47.180
So when you talk about Usonian house, Usonia
to him is a term for a culturally mature United

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:48.180
States.

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:53.410
So if you talk about, “you too can own an
American home,” in this case, it's talking

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:56.220
about an aspiration for a greater society
actually.
