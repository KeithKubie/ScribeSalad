00:00:00.833 --> 00:00:02.766
Voiceover:Let's think about what it means

00:00:02.766 --> 00:00:04.733
to add numbers.

00:00:05.434 --> 00:00:07.866
So let's start with 1.

00:00:08.567 --> 00:00:11.266
1 plus.

00:00:12.033 --> 00:00:14.267
1 plus 1.

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:18.133
What is this going to be equal to?

00:00:19.366 --> 00:00:23.033
One way to think about this is we have

00:00:23.033 --> 00:00:28.800
1 thing, and that thing
will be a purple circle.

00:00:29.166 --> 00:00:31.533
So let me put that here.

00:00:31.633 --> 00:00:33.333
So that's this 1 thing.

00:00:33.566 --> 00:00:34.567
I'm just going to represent it with

00:00:34.567 --> 00:00:35.666
a purple circle.

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.400
And I'm going to add another 1 thing.

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:38.966
And since this is in blue, I'll make

00:00:38.966 --> 00:00:41.600
that other circle, I'll
make that in blue as well.

00:00:42.367 --> 00:00:44.667
So let me put that right over here.

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:46.934
So 1 plus 1.

00:00:47.233 --> 00:00:48.266
1 plus 1.

00:00:48.633 --> 00:00:51.466
How many total circles do I now have?

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.400
Well, I now have 2 circles.

00:00:54.966 --> 00:00:57.400
I now have 2 circles.

00:00:57.901 --> 00:01:04.266
1 plus 1 is equal to, is equal to 2.

00:01:04.701 --> 00:01:06.233
Okay, you're saying all
right Sal, all right,

00:01:06.233 --> 00:01:07.800
that makes sense.

00:01:08.033 --> 00:01:10.866
Let's do this with larger numbers.

00:01:11.499 --> 00:01:15.133
So let's say we want
to know what equals ...

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:17.266
And I'll put a question mark over here.

00:01:17.566 --> 00:01:18.933
So, question mark.

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.000
What equals ...

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:26.334
So something is equal to, is equal to,

00:01:26.833 --> 00:01:33.667
let's say, 2, 2, 2 plus 3.

00:01:34.166 --> 00:01:38.066
Something is equal to 2 plus 3.

00:01:38.633 --> 00:01:41.400
What is this something going to be?

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:44.100
I encourage you to pause
the video and think

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.600
about it on your own.

00:01:46.366 --> 00:01:48.700
Well, you could view
this as, I have 2 objects

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.066
and then we're going to
add another 3 objects.

00:01:51.366 --> 00:01:53.534
How many total objects would I have?

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.300
So you have your 2 objects, which I'll use

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:00.867
purple circles again.

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:02.466
So let me ...

00:02:03.366 --> 00:02:09.200
Let me, so, we have 1
and 2 purple circles.

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:11.066
This is the 2 right over here.

00:02:11.233 --> 00:02:13.800
And then to that we're
going to add 3 more.

00:02:14.233 --> 00:02:15.733
3 more circles.

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.434
I'll represent those in blue because we

00:02:18.434 --> 00:02:20.066
wrote the 3, here, in blue.

00:02:20.766 --> 00:02:29.001
So that is 1, 2, and 3.

00:02:29.566 --> 00:02:33.066
So how many total circles do we now have?

00:02:33.833 --> 00:02:35.133
Well, we could count them.

00:02:35.433 --> 00:02:38.801
We have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:40.000
In fact, let me count that.

00:02:40.034 --> 00:02:45.000
1, 2, 3, 4, 5 circles.

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:47.033
So 2 plus 3.

00:02:47.033 --> 00:02:50.600
2 things plus another
3 things are 5 things.

00:02:50.966 --> 00:02:52.566
So our question mark, right over here,

00:02:52.566 --> 00:02:54.266
is equal to 5.

00:02:54.966 --> 00:02:56.833
So instead of writing the question mark

00:02:56.833 --> 00:02:59.469
right over here, let me clear that out.

00:02:59.766 --> 00:03:02.200
I could say 5 is equal to.

00:03:02.833 --> 00:03:10.000
I could write down that
5 is equal to 2 plus 3.
