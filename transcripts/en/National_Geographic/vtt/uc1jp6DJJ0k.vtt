00:00:00.867 --> 00:00:03.802
Why I'm here today,
talking to you, here,

00:00:03.802 --> 00:00:06.239
in this amazing special place?

00:00:07.873 --> 00:00:11.011
It's because of a slug story.

00:00:11.011 --> 00:00:14.547 align:start size:94% position:6%
Basic slug story, you
know how those stories go?

00:00:14.547 --> 00:00:17.683
You know, I couldn't
have my pocket money

00:00:17.683 --> 00:00:18.951 line:0%
when I was a kid.

00:00:18.951 --> 00:00:21.154 line:0%
Grow up in Switzerland.

00:00:21.154 --> 00:00:22.722 line:0%
Picture this.

00:00:22.722 --> 00:00:29.562 align:start size:94% position:6% line:0%
This white peak, green field,
with nice little chalet.

00:00:29.562 --> 00:00:30.930
Can you see that?

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:31.965
Yeah.

00:00:31.965 --> 00:00:33.232
Well it's not there.

00:00:33.232 --> 00:00:36.235
It's up north, foggy, raining,

00:00:36.235 --> 00:00:39.205 align:start size:84% position:16%
the most jobless
area in Switzerland.

00:00:39.205 --> 00:00:42.575
You usually never get
away from that place.

00:00:42.575 --> 00:00:46.178 align:start size:94% position:6%
I live in a tiny village,
it's a dead end road.

00:00:46.178 --> 00:00:48.247
There's nothing after that.

00:00:48.247 --> 00:00:52.285 align:start size:88% position:13%
You feel like you are
at the end of the world.

00:00:52.285 --> 00:00:53.353
And I grew up there.

00:00:53.353 --> 00:00:54.621
I'm from there.

00:00:56.055 --> 00:00:59.392 align:start size:94% position:6%
And I've got two brothers,
one older, one younger.

00:00:59.392 --> 00:01:02.695
And I keep going back
to my father, saying,

00:01:02.695 --> 00:01:06.065 align:start size:84% position:16%
"I need some pocket
money, give me money."

00:01:06.065 --> 00:01:08.667
He said, "no way you're
going to get money."

00:01:08.667 --> 00:01:12.839
Anyway, I annoyed him so
much, that one day he said,

00:01:13.872 --> 00:01:16.242
"okay, we make a deal."

00:01:16.242 --> 00:01:18.377 align:start size:84% position:16%
I've got the garden
full of slugs.

00:01:18.377 --> 00:01:21.815 align:start size:84% position:16%
You collect 100 slugs,
and I give you $1.

00:01:24.083 --> 00:01:25.651
Mmm.

00:01:25.651 --> 00:01:27.453
Interesting.

00:01:27.453 --> 00:01:30.756
I spend all my time in the
garden when it was raining,

00:01:30.756 --> 00:01:33.593 align:start position:0%
because those slugs were
coming out when it was raining.

00:01:33.593 --> 00:01:37.530 align:start size:84% position:16%
Collect all those
slugs, 600 I needed.

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.300
And what I will
do with those $6?

00:01:41.501 --> 00:01:45.671
I will run in town, and
buy National Geographic.

00:01:45.671 --> 00:01:47.941
I was seven years old.

00:01:47.941 --> 00:01:50.777
So tonight, it's the
first presentation

00:01:50.777 --> 00:01:53.913 align:start size:88% position:13%
that I do here, in
National Geographic DC,

00:01:53.913 --> 00:01:56.682
and I'm really proud
to talk to you tonight.

00:01:56.682 --> 00:01:58.951 align:start size:84% position:16%
It's really something
deep in my heart.

00:01:58.951 --> 00:02:01.988 align:start size:84% position:16%
This is the example
that dreams come true,

00:02:01.988 --> 00:02:05.391
because I want,
as a little girl,

00:02:05.391 --> 00:02:09.595 align:start size:94% position:6%
to travel to those
weird, incredible places.

00:02:09.595 --> 00:02:12.765 align:start size:88% position:13%
So I spent my childhood
in the forest.

00:02:12.765 --> 00:02:16.102
I had this amazing
guidebook, bird book.

00:02:17.537 --> 00:02:20.907
On the front page there was
this beautiful blue bird,

00:02:20.907 --> 00:02:25.078 align:start size:97% position:3%
with a bit of red and
yellowish thing on the back.

00:02:26.712 --> 00:02:29.415
But they forgot to tell me
that it was not in Europe

00:02:29.415 --> 00:02:31.751
and not in my country.

00:02:31.751 --> 00:02:34.253 align:start size:88% position:13%
So I spent all my
childhood in the woods,

00:02:34.253 --> 00:02:35.754
looking for that bird.

00:02:35.754 --> 00:02:39.425
My parents were quite happy
I was in the woods somewhere,

00:02:39.425 --> 00:02:41.627
looking for birds.

00:02:41.627 --> 00:02:44.663 align:start size:84% position:16%
Anyway, I took my
revenge on this one.

00:02:44.663 --> 00:02:47.600 align:start size:94% position:6%
And I would like to invite
you with me tonight,

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.236 align:start size:88% position:13%
we're going to be starving,
it's going to be hot,

00:02:50.236 --> 00:02:52.405 align:start size:88% position:13%
you're going to see
snakes, and crocodiles.

00:02:52.405 --> 00:02:55.675
Welcome to Dropped
Into the Wild Corner.

00:02:55.675 --> 00:02:57.844
My most recent expedition.

00:02:59.245 --> 00:03:03.149 align:start size:97% position:3%
My concern was, how we
going to feed the world today?

00:03:04.583 --> 00:03:08.054 align:start size:97% position:3%
Because I was in China, I
saw all these Chinese people,

00:03:08.054 --> 00:03:11.958 align:start size:94% position:6%
build houses like, really
high, a lot of people

00:03:13.092 --> 00:03:14.427
in the same room.

00:03:14.427 --> 00:03:16.895
And I thought, how
we going to do this?

00:03:16.895 --> 00:03:20.466 align:start size:88% position:13%
How we going to keep using
the planet that way?

00:03:20.466 --> 00:03:24.237
I was concerned about, it's
going to be somebody hungry

00:03:24.237 --> 00:03:28.107 align:start size:97% position:3%
in this world, in some ways,
in some times, coming up.

00:03:28.107 --> 00:03:30.576
How we going to do this?

00:03:30.576 --> 00:03:33.479
So, I decided to
take on a journey.

00:03:34.913 --> 00:03:37.916 align:start size:84% position:16%
I wanted to understand
how we can do this.

00:03:37.916 --> 00:03:42.088
Go back to the roots, at the
time of the gather and hunter.

00:03:43.255 --> 00:03:47.660
Yes, I will find my own
food, on my own terms,

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:50.729
following the Aboriginal people,
that have been doing this

00:03:50.729 --> 00:03:51.864
for 60,000 years.

00:03:51.864 --> 00:03:52.699
So.

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:54.968
But, as usual.

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:00.206 align:start size:88% position:13%
Expeditions really start
when things go wrong.

00:04:00.206 --> 00:04:03.642 align:start size:97% position:3%
And start to be really going
wrong at the first minute

00:04:03.642 --> 00:04:05.611
of the expedition.

00:04:05.611 --> 00:04:10.148 align:start size:97% position:3%
So, I learned in a little
town, on the northwest corner

00:04:10.148 --> 00:04:12.819
of Australia, called Kununurra.

00:04:14.053 --> 00:04:15.721
Word like that long.

00:04:15.721 --> 00:04:19.292 align:start size:88% position:13%
It's a weird town,
where you've got cowboy,

00:04:19.292 --> 00:04:23.463
Aboriginal people, mining
people, all mixed together.

00:04:25.931 --> 00:04:29.268 align:start size:84% position:16%
Arrive there with a
little airplane, land,

00:04:29.268 --> 00:04:35.441
and I open my phone, my dear
friend supposed to be there,

00:04:35.441 --> 00:04:40.112
helping me for one month to go
and check all my techniques,

00:04:40.112 --> 00:04:41.614
surviving techniques
that I've been learning

00:04:41.614 --> 00:04:43.349
over the years.

00:04:43.349 --> 00:04:47.620 align:start size:94% position:6%
Included really technical
fishing techniques.

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:50.089 align:start size:94% position:6%
And I received this lovely
text, it was saying,

00:04:50.089 --> 00:04:52.825
"Sorry darling,
I can't make it."

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:56.095
I was like, "What?!"

00:04:56.095 --> 00:04:59.699 align:start size:88% position:13%
We've been planning
this for a year, what?!

00:05:01.534 --> 00:05:05.238
And I tried to call
him like 55 times,

00:05:05.238 --> 00:05:07.439
never answered the phone.

00:05:07.439 --> 00:05:09.441
And I called my team
back in Switzerland

00:05:09.441 --> 00:05:13.045 align:start size:84% position:16%
and I said, hey guys,
how we going to do this?

00:05:13.045 --> 00:05:14.947 align:start size:84% position:16%
And my assistant was
getting agitated.

00:05:14.947 --> 00:05:19.118
Sarah, my god, you have to
leave in four weeks time,

00:05:20.319 --> 00:05:22.188
how we going to do this?

00:05:22.188 --> 00:05:23.555
I said, you know darling,

00:05:23.555 --> 00:05:25.691 align:start size:84% position:16%
when things get
agitated like that,

00:05:25.691 --> 00:05:27.993
there's only one option.

00:05:27.993 --> 00:05:30.462
I'm going to drink coffee.

00:05:30.462 --> 00:05:34.133
You know, in nature,
when there is a danger,

00:05:35.668 --> 00:05:38.704 align:start size:84% position:16%
and there is
something so intense,

00:05:38.704 --> 00:05:41.040
animals just stop and froze.

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:43.542 align:start size:88% position:13%
I'm just going to stop and
froze and drink coffee

00:05:43.542 --> 00:05:45.745 align:start size:81% position:19%
until I see a sign
in front of me.

00:05:45.745 --> 00:05:47.279
That's it.

00:05:47.279 --> 00:05:52.184 align:start size:97% position:3%
And I can hear my assistant,
"you are crazy darling."

00:05:52.184 --> 00:05:53.452
I did that.

00:05:53.452 --> 00:05:56.088
Stop in a coffee shop,
drink for five hours.

00:05:56.088 --> 00:05:58.924
The night went down,
I took my little car,

00:05:58.924 --> 00:06:02.728 align:start size:94% position:6%
went to find my
accommodation that night.

00:06:02.728 --> 00:06:05.631
I booked a room in the farm,

00:06:05.631 --> 00:06:10.269 align:start size:97% position:3%
and this lady, received
me, she was waiting for me,

00:06:10.269 --> 00:06:14.506
and she just walked out of
the door of the property.

00:06:14.506 --> 00:06:16.843
She had a designer dress on.

00:06:18.044 --> 00:06:22.114
Pink dress, beautiful,
hair done, makeup on.

00:06:22.114 --> 00:06:24.083
I was like, what?!

00:06:24.083 --> 00:06:27.853 align:start size:97% position:3%
I'm in the remotest location
in the bush in Australia,

00:06:27.853 --> 00:06:31.156
and she's wearing
this kind of thing?

00:06:31.156 --> 00:06:33.626
I thought, this woman
never going to help me,

00:06:33.626 --> 00:06:34.960
not this one.

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:36.428
Went to bed.

00:06:36.428 --> 00:06:38.263 align:start size:88% position:13%
Anyway, the next morning
she knock on my door,

00:06:38.263 --> 00:06:41.701
and she say, "Sarah, do you
want to have coffee with me?"

00:06:41.701 --> 00:06:43.535
Say, "lovely, yeah."

00:06:43.535 --> 00:06:44.370
Why not?

00:06:45.437 --> 00:06:47.606 align:start size:84% position:16%
Anyway, we had
coffee, and she said,

00:06:47.606 --> 00:06:50.709
"what brings you here, darling?"

00:06:50.709 --> 00:06:53.212
Say, "well, I'm coming to walk."

00:06:55.581 --> 00:06:58.951
I try not to deliver too many
information at the same time,

00:06:58.951 --> 00:07:01.553 align:start size:97% position:3%
because usually I get
arrested before I do anything.

00:07:01.553 --> 00:07:05.591
So, I learned my lesson in
China when I get arrested

00:07:05.591 --> 00:07:09.194 align:start size:94% position:6%
by Special Forces, I
learned my lesson in Laos

00:07:09.194 --> 00:07:12.397
when the drug dealer arrest me,

00:07:12.397 --> 00:07:17.002
I learned my lesson in
Mongolia when Mongol man

00:07:17.002 --> 00:07:21.174 align:start size:97% position:3%
ran through my camp every
night tried to steal my stuff.

00:07:22.341 --> 00:07:25.678 align:start size:84% position:16%
So, yeah, I was hoping
to do some walking.

00:07:27.179 --> 00:07:29.615
And she said, she
jumped on her seat,

00:07:29.615 --> 00:07:31.950 align:start size:84% position:16%
really literally
jumped, and she said,

00:07:31.950 --> 00:07:34.953
well, I just come
back from Europe.

00:07:34.953 --> 00:07:37.723
I did the Camino, in Europe.

00:07:37.723 --> 00:07:39.825
I was like, what?!

00:07:39.825 --> 00:07:41.894
She was a walker.

00:07:41.894 --> 00:07:44.296
Anyway, she said, you
want some brownie?

00:07:44.296 --> 00:07:46.165
I said, "of course I
want some brownie."

00:07:46.165 --> 00:07:49.601 align:start size:94% position:6%
She got some fresh brownie
coming from the oven,

00:07:49.601 --> 00:07:52.104
I said, "yes, let's
have some brownie."

00:07:52.104 --> 00:07:55.608 align:start size:88% position:13%
We start chatting, like
two women can chat.

00:07:55.608 --> 00:07:57.509 align:start size:84% position:16%
And she said, 
"don't worry, wait."

00:07:57.509 --> 00:07:59.978
She took the phone, make
like five phone calls.

00:07:59.978 --> 00:08:02.882 align:start position:0%
She said, "okay, you've got a
meeting tomorrow with this one,"

00:08:02.882 --> 00:08:05.150 align:start size:84% position:16%
"then a coffee at
four with this one,"

00:08:05.150 --> 00:08:07.286
"dinner with this one."

00:08:07.286 --> 00:08:08.788
I said who is this woman?

00:08:08.788 --> 00:08:11.090
You will see, go, I don't
have time to come with you,

00:08:11.090 --> 00:08:12.324 size:81% position:41%
but you'll manage.

00:08:12.324 --> 00:08:16.495
Anyway, in a weeks time,
I made this networking

00:08:16.495 --> 00:08:19.498
of powerful women in this town.

00:08:19.498 --> 00:08:21.967
The lawyer of the town,
the doctor of the town,

00:08:21.967 --> 00:08:24.704
I had all of them
under my wings.

00:08:26.138 --> 00:08:30.309
And they pushed me, and helped
me to rebuild my expedition.

00:08:30.309 --> 00:08:32.077 align:start size:84% position:16%
Reroute completely
my expedition,

00:08:32.077 --> 00:08:33.846
restart from scratch.

00:08:35.581 --> 00:08:38.984
And four weeks later,
I was ready to go.

00:08:38.984 --> 00:08:42.054
But everybody, that
I was talking to,

00:08:42.054 --> 00:08:44.690 align:start size:97% position:3%
having the same
conversation over and over,

00:08:44.690 --> 00:08:47.993 align:start size:84% position:16%
was saying to me,
it's a drought year.

00:08:47.993 --> 00:08:50.529
There is not enough
water in the bush,

00:08:50.529 --> 00:08:52.231
you will not be able to survive.

00:08:52.231 --> 00:08:54.700
Everybody was saying that.

00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:56.569
And you know, when people
are always got this opinion

00:08:56.569 --> 00:08:58.069
about my expedition.

00:08:58.069 --> 00:08:59.671
They look at me, they judge me,

00:08:59.671 --> 00:09:00.972
they look at me and they say,

00:09:00.972 --> 00:09:02.441
"What this blondie-thing hair,

00:09:02.441 --> 00:09:05.244 align:start size:81% position:19%
"she's not good
for these things."

00:09:06.412 --> 00:09:09.614
Anyway, I thought,
maybe this time,

00:09:09.614 --> 00:09:12.584
I better listen a little bit.

00:09:12.584 --> 00:09:14.319
And I decided to do a test.

00:09:14.319 --> 00:09:16.389
And before, I wanted to spend

00:09:16.389 --> 00:09:18.323 align:start size:81% position:19%
some time with
Aboriginal people.

00:09:18.323 --> 00:09:20.726
That's how I met Juju.

00:09:20.726 --> 00:09:24.363 align:start size:97% position:3%
In a center, it's a
full-blood Aboriginal woman.

00:09:24.363 --> 00:09:27.700 align:start size:84% position:16%
Really important woman
in her community.

00:09:29.135 --> 00:09:32.137
And, the young people around
her is the new generation.

00:09:32.137 --> 00:09:34.707
They're the kids of her sister.

00:09:38.210 --> 00:09:42.180
So, you can see the pure
blood, it's really rare

00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:45.951
to find some pure-blood
Aboriginal these days.

00:09:45.951 --> 00:09:49.622
And we went on a tour
together, in the bush.

00:09:50.522 --> 00:09:52.124
We spent some time in the bush,

00:09:52.124 --> 00:09:55.594
and she will give
me some tricks.

00:09:55.594 --> 00:09:58.931
But she will not give
me all the tricks.

00:10:00.299 --> 00:10:02.401
She didn't know that I know.

00:10:02.401 --> 00:10:04.937
She didn't know that I have
been preparing these things

00:10:04.937 --> 00:10:05.972
for 20 years.

00:10:07.406 --> 00:10:10.309 align:start size:94% position:6%
So she will give me the
tricks, but not all of it.

00:10:10.309 --> 00:10:13.345 align:start size:88% position:13%
She will give me the
wrong plant to look for.

00:10:13.345 --> 00:10:17.349
Not the good ripe ones, she
will give me the young one,

00:10:17.349 --> 00:10:20.419 align:start size:84% position:16%
where there was
nothing to eat there.

00:10:20.419 --> 00:10:24.490
And I was wondering, the
more I spent time with her,

00:10:24.490 --> 00:10:26.325
what's going on here?

00:10:26.325 --> 00:10:29.227
Why she doesn't give
me the full trick?

00:10:29.227 --> 00:10:33.899
Is it because she feel
like I don't own my path

00:10:33.899 --> 00:10:35.400
through her land?

00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:38.236 align:start size:94% position:6%
Or it is because she
don't want me to get hurt

00:10:38.236 --> 00:10:39.938
and go back home?

00:10:39.938 --> 00:10:42.908
I didn't know what
she was thinking.

00:10:42.908 --> 00:10:45.511 align:start size:97% position:3%
I didn't know what everybody
was thinking, really.

00:10:45.511 --> 00:10:48.180
I decided to do a test.

00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:49.648
And I just did that.

00:10:49.648 --> 00:10:53.285 align:start size:97% position:3%
I went in the bush, get
dropped with a little plane,

00:10:53.285 --> 00:10:55.987
walked for seven days,
and discovered exactly

00:10:55.987 --> 00:10:57.489
what they were talking about.

00:10:57.489 --> 00:10:59.525
There was not enough food there.

00:10:59.525 --> 00:11:01.727
They were right, actually.

00:11:01.727 --> 00:11:05.197 align:start size:84% position:16%
So, I decided to take
a Plan B with me,

00:11:05.197 --> 00:11:09.134
I decided to take 150
grams of flour per day

00:11:09.134 --> 00:11:10.469
as a Plan B.

00:11:10.469 --> 00:11:12.738
If things go wrong.

00:11:12.738 --> 00:11:15.007
So I looked like that.

00:11:15.007 --> 00:11:17.609
It's a little flat bread,

00:11:17.609 --> 00:11:21.047
and I wonder today if
it was a good idea.

00:11:21.047 --> 00:11:24.183
Because you know, when
you've got, in your pack,

00:11:24.183 --> 00:11:28.354 align:start position:0%
food, you so starving but
you're not allowed to touch it.

00:11:31.890 --> 00:11:34.292
It's like having the
fridge full of food,

00:11:34.292 --> 00:11:35.795
and you in a diet.

00:11:37.296 --> 00:11:38.564
Can't touch it.

00:11:40.399 --> 00:11:41.734
It was horrible.

00:11:42.901 --> 00:11:45.705
But I desired to
do this that way.

00:11:47.138 --> 00:11:49.374 align:start size:97% position:3%
So let's go, we're going to get
dropped with a helicopter

00:11:49.374 --> 00:11:51.777
northwest of Australia.

00:11:51.777 --> 00:11:55.614 align:start size:84% position:16%
Precisely there,
there's nobody there.

00:11:55.614 --> 00:11:58.884
It's empty land, no
human, it's for me.

00:12:00.986 --> 00:12:03.489
So, get dropped there
with the helicopter,

00:12:03.489 --> 00:12:06.658
the pilot said to me, "Are
you sure you want to get

00:12:06.658 --> 00:12:09.161 align:start size:84% position:16%
"dropped here?
There's nothing here."

00:12:09.161 --> 00:12:11.930
I said this is exactly where
I want to get dropped, here.

00:12:11.930 --> 00:12:14.100
And he said, "okay, good luck."

00:12:14.100 --> 00:12:15.434
And he fly away.

00:12:16.768 --> 00:12:20.106
And I can hear the
ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch,

00:12:23.341 --> 00:12:25.110
and then nothing.

00:12:25.110 --> 00:12:27.846
So welcome in Australia.

00:12:27.846 --> 00:12:31.883
Well we can see it's
not flat at all, right?

00:12:31.883 --> 00:12:33.252
So the good thing about this,

00:12:33.252 --> 00:12:35.020
there is valley here.

00:12:36.455 --> 00:12:39.658 align:start position:0%
So, on the bottom of the valley,
we've got a bit of water.

00:12:39.658 --> 00:12:42.394 align:start size:84% position:16%
See, you've got water,
bit of green thing,

00:12:42.394 --> 00:12:44.697
means we're going to find food.

00:12:44.697 --> 00:12:47.832
So, this always a
bit the same story.

00:12:47.832 --> 00:12:50.936
You've got water, you've got
frog, frog you've got snakes,

00:12:50.936 --> 00:12:53.171
snakes you've got crocodile.

00:12:53.171 --> 00:12:55.374
It goes like that a bit.

00:12:55.374 --> 00:12:56.709
So, I knew that.

00:12:57.976 --> 00:13:00.913
So, that's how I
start, my journey.

00:13:04.416 --> 00:13:05.951
So rule number one.

00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:11.390
Do not camp near the water.

00:13:11.390 --> 00:13:16.061 align:start size:94% position:6%
Do not take your water two
times in the same spot.

00:13:16.061 --> 00:13:19.898 align:start size:84% position:16%
The first time,
you're going to be okay.

00:13:19.898 --> 00:13:23.002 align:start size:84% position:16%
But, the second time
he will get you.

00:13:23.002 --> 00:13:27.139
So this kind of area there,
it's full of things like,

00:13:27.139 --> 00:13:30.209
crawling, spiders
everywhere, snakes,

00:13:31.443 --> 00:13:32.844
but two types of crocodile.

00:13:32.844 --> 00:13:35.981 align:start size:97% position:3%
One is sweetwater
crocodile, they are lovely.

00:13:35.981 --> 00:13:38.049
Really lovely creature.

00:13:38.049 --> 00:13:40.051
They talk to you,
you talk to them,

00:13:40.051 --> 00:13:41.853
it's really lovely relationship.

00:13:41.853 --> 00:13:43.588 align:start size:81% position:19%
And then you've
got the other one,

00:13:43.588 --> 00:13:45.891
it's a big salty crocodile.

00:13:45.891 --> 00:13:50.062
They eat cattle, horses, big
thing, human, they love it.

00:13:52.832 --> 00:13:55.667
So they eat those things,
they turn them around,

00:13:55.667 --> 00:13:59.638 size:81% position:41%
they put them underneath
the water under a log,

00:13:59.638 --> 00:14:03.642 align:start position:0%
leave you there for a few
weeks, so you get really tender.

00:14:03.642 --> 00:14:05.177
They go back there.

00:14:06.579 --> 00:14:10.216 align:start size:94% position:6%
So it's all about managing
your landscape right.

00:14:11.850 --> 00:14:14.787
So, I was there,
lovely camp, look.

00:14:16.421 --> 00:14:20.326
Afternoon, I've got a
little fire going on,

00:14:20.326 --> 00:14:21.926
my little house.

00:14:21.926 --> 00:14:24.830 align:start size:84% position:16%
And far enough away
from the water.

00:14:27.065 --> 00:14:28.734
So I'm there, taking my water,

00:14:28.734 --> 00:14:32.471
so I'm really safe there, so
I've got a bucket of water,

00:14:32.471 --> 00:14:35.340 align:start size:97% position:3%
like a flexible bucket of
water, like a plastic thing.

00:14:35.340 --> 00:14:38.576
And I put my rope
at the end of it,

00:14:38.576 --> 00:14:41.146 align:start size:97% position:3%
and I decide to take my
water, so I throw the thing

00:14:41.146 --> 00:14:44.116 align:start size:84% position:16%
in the water, and
retrieve the bucket.

00:14:44.116 --> 00:14:47.252 align:start size:97% position:3%
And unfortunately, the
thing didn't open properly.

00:14:47.252 --> 00:14:49.889
I was like, Sarah Marquis.

00:14:49.889 --> 00:14:52.991 align:start size:94% position:6%
Really, are you that
good, it's going to be good.

00:14:52.991 --> 00:14:56.028
It's going to be really
long journey like that.

00:14:56.028 --> 00:14:58.663 align:start size:84% position:16%
Anyway, I start
again, open the thing,

00:14:58.663 --> 00:15:00.132
throw that thing
in the water again.

00:15:00.132 --> 00:15:02.267
And retrieve it.

00:15:02.267 --> 00:15:04.236 align:start size:84% position:16%
This time I'm
going to get it right.

00:15:04.236 --> 00:15:06.372
I retrieve this bucket,

00:15:06.372 --> 00:15:08.507 align:start size:94% position:6%
and suddenly there was
this branch in the middle,

00:15:08.507 --> 00:15:12.377 align:start size:94% position:6%
and I was like, ah, I
haven't seen that branch?

00:15:12.377 --> 00:15:13.512
Really?

00:15:13.512 --> 00:15:14.713
Getting better.

00:15:14.713 --> 00:15:17.515 align:start size:88% position:13%
And I just did this
little push, like that,

00:15:17.515 --> 00:15:19.751 align:start size:84% position:16%
just for the bucket
to go over the branch.

00:15:19.751 --> 00:15:22.421
And suddenly the branch
was pulling me back.

00:15:22.421 --> 00:15:24.556
That was my first
crocodile fight.

00:15:24.556 --> 00:15:27.960 align:start size:84% position:16%
Yeah, that was the
kind of welcome party.

00:15:29.928 --> 00:15:34.099 align:start size:97% position:3%
And, that was the beginning
of a really long relationship.

00:15:35.166 --> 00:15:37.836
So how you deal with crocodiles?

00:15:40.305 --> 00:15:43.041 align:start size:88% position:13%
Well, you have to learn,
you have to be aware

00:15:43.041 --> 00:15:46.077 align:start size:84% position:16%
of your surroundings
at any moment.

00:15:46.077 --> 00:15:47.412
It's really important.

00:15:47.412 --> 00:15:50.315
It's valuable for us here also.

00:15:50.315 --> 00:15:53.252
So, that day, that was
a special day that day.

00:15:53.252 --> 00:15:55.954
I'll tell you, I did
amazing discovery.

00:15:55.954 --> 00:15:58.556
I was exhausted, as usual.

00:15:58.556 --> 00:16:02.928
And starving, because I've
been starving quite a lot.

00:16:02.928 --> 00:16:05.264
And, that was a laundry day.

00:16:06.565 --> 00:16:09.301
I wash a bit my
stuff on the way.

00:16:10.435 --> 00:16:13.405 align:start size:84% position:16%
So I had my long, it's
like a long shirt,

00:16:13.405 --> 00:16:16.675
long sleeve, and
I took some water,

00:16:16.675 --> 00:16:20.311
and I decide to wash
it, so I squeeze it,

00:16:20.311 --> 00:16:21.713
and I decide to have a nice, ah,

00:16:21.713 --> 00:16:25.650
to get rid of that
water a little bit.

00:16:25.650 --> 00:16:28.620
And suddenly I hear a noise.

00:16:28.620 --> 00:16:31.456
It be like, (high
pitched bird call?)

00:16:31.456 --> 00:16:33.057
Like a crinky noise like that.

00:16:33.057 --> 00:16:35.294
I was like, what?!

00:16:35.294 --> 00:16:38.663
And suddenly I'm just
like, under the bushes

00:16:38.663 --> 00:16:41.299
straight away, looking
for what's going on.

00:16:41.299 --> 00:16:44.269
Because you don't want
to stand like a big,

00:16:44.269 --> 00:16:46.404
tall asparagus in the
middle of the bush.

00:16:46.404 --> 00:16:48.040
Is just, do not do this.

00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:51.076
You have to be on the
ground, all the time.

00:16:51.076 --> 00:16:54.679 align:start size:94% position:6%
And then, I'm there,
waiting to see that bird,

00:16:54.679 --> 00:16:57.116 align:start size:97% position:3%
because I know all of the
birds, I know all the plants,

00:16:57.116 --> 00:17:01.252 align:start size:97% position:3%
I've been studying that
landscape for days and years.

00:17:01.252 --> 00:17:03.455
Never heard about that bird.

00:17:03.455 --> 00:17:05.190
Anyway, I forgot
about that thing,

00:17:05.190 --> 00:17:08.393
took my jacket, and
smashed it again.

00:17:08.393 --> 00:17:10.762
I hear the same noise.

00:17:10.762 --> 00:17:12.564
It's like, really?!

00:17:12.564 --> 00:17:14.265 align:start size:84% position:16%
But it was not
coming from the bush.

00:17:14.265 --> 00:17:17.135
It was coming from that cliff.

00:17:17.135 --> 00:17:19.203
And at the bottom of the cliff,

00:17:19.203 --> 00:17:22.273
I just get on the edge of it,

00:17:22.273 --> 00:17:25.077
and I saw this little
crocodiles lined up,

00:17:25.077 --> 00:17:26.345
talking to mom.

00:17:27.846 --> 00:17:32.117 align:start size:94% position:6%
I discovered that day,
the call of the crocodile.

00:17:32.117 --> 00:17:34.186
Yes, scientific discovery.

00:17:34.186 --> 00:17:35.020
See?

00:17:36.187 --> 00:17:38.322
So I've been studying
this for a long time

00:17:38.322 --> 00:17:40.159
before I head off an expedition.

00:17:40.159 --> 00:17:44.662 align:start size:94% position:6%
Nobody could actually
tell me what was the trick

00:17:44.662 --> 00:17:47.699 align:start size:97% position:3%
to know if there was a
crocodile in the water or not.

00:17:47.699 --> 00:17:50.302
The Aboriginal people
used to go in the water

00:17:50.302 --> 00:17:53.771 align:start size:88% position:13%
with two stones, getting
inside the water,

00:17:53.771 --> 00:17:56.408
and smash the stones together.

00:17:56.408 --> 00:17:58.510 align:start size:81% position:19%
And then they make
a little noise,

00:17:58.510 --> 00:18:01.046
and then they will know if
there's a crocodile there.

00:18:01.046 --> 00:18:02.414
Well, that's a bit
too late, right,

00:18:02.414 --> 00:18:04.582 align:start size:81% position:19%
you're just in
the water already.

00:18:04.582 --> 00:18:07.386
It's like the supper thing.

00:18:07.386 --> 00:18:09.354
You are on the menu.

00:18:09.354 --> 00:18:10.588
So, you don't want that.

00:18:10.588 --> 00:18:13.124
So nobody never told me
what to do, actually,

00:18:13.124 --> 00:18:15.260
to know if it's the
crocodile there.

00:18:15.260 --> 00:18:18.162
So I discovered the call
of the crocodile that day.

00:18:18.162 --> 00:18:19.431
And that was a good day for me,

00:18:19.431 --> 00:18:22.200 align:start size:84% position:16%
because the day
coming on from there,

00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:25.236
I would actually smash my
shirt, put a bit of water

00:18:25.236 --> 00:18:26.905
on the bottom, and I
would actually discover

00:18:26.905 --> 00:18:29.908 align:start size:84% position:16%
if there was crocodile
there or not.

00:18:31.309 --> 00:18:33.511
So when you're going
to do those things,

00:18:33.511 --> 00:18:36.415
the only thing you have to know,

00:18:36.415 --> 00:18:37.648
you have to be able

00:18:37.648 --> 00:18:40.986
to read the landscape
like a treasure map.

00:18:42.254 --> 00:18:45.457
I would find, sometimes,
some water just because

00:18:45.457 --> 00:18:48.794
I found a little bird
on a type of tree.

00:18:50.595 --> 00:18:53.532
Because I know all those birds.

00:18:53.532 --> 00:18:56.802
The little red bird,
the diamond finch,

00:18:58.003 --> 00:19:01.272
I know they can fly five
kilometers around only.

00:19:01.272 --> 00:19:04.977
And I know they have to
drink two times a day.

00:19:04.977 --> 00:19:07.712 align:start size:84% position:16%
So I know there would
be water around.

00:19:07.712 --> 00:19:09.814
Or if I find a type of plant,

00:19:09.814 --> 00:19:12.784
I would know exactly what
kind of roots I can find,

00:19:12.784 --> 00:19:14.453
and I can find food.

00:19:15.887 --> 00:19:18.123
My food, it's all I've got.

00:19:19.758 --> 00:19:22.828 align:start size:84% position:16%
You know, you realize
after you peel,

00:19:23.729 --> 00:19:25.797
life, it's like an onion.

00:19:26.698 --> 00:19:28.800
You peel the onion.

00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:32.036 align:start size:84% position:16%
Once you peel where
you come from,

00:19:32.036 --> 00:19:34.372
who you are in this society,

00:19:34.372 --> 00:19:37.141 align:start size:81% position:19%
and you get to the
core of things,

00:19:37.141 --> 00:19:42.146
you realize that things are
really simple, actually.

00:19:42.146 --> 00:19:46.818 align:start size:97% position:3%
We all want the same thing,
we want our family to be safe,

00:19:46.818 --> 00:19:50.088 align:start size:84% position:16%
we want food and
water, shelter, basic.

00:19:51.490 --> 00:19:53.291
That was my morning.

00:19:53.291 --> 00:19:55.760
This was my breakfast.

00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:59.530
Every morning it would be easy
for me to find my breakfast.

00:19:59.530 --> 00:20:03.568
I will eat those kapok
flower, and those flower

00:20:03.568 --> 00:20:07.673 align:start size:97% position:3%
are incredible, because
they're juicy, a bit gluey,

00:20:08.807 --> 00:20:12.577 align:start size:88% position:13%
not much taste, but
that will fill my tummy.

00:20:12.577 --> 00:20:15.313
So after a while,
after a few weeks,

00:20:15.313 --> 00:20:19.918 align:start size:94% position:6%
my tummy, would actually,
the side of my tummy

00:20:19.918 --> 00:20:21.587
will stick together.

00:20:23.021 --> 00:20:26.658
I will be so starving, like,
I couldn't sleep at night.

00:20:30.028 --> 00:20:34.299 align:start size:97% position:3%
And that's after three weeks,
I thought I was hungry,

00:20:34.299 --> 00:20:35.533
but wait.

00:20:35.533 --> 00:20:37.302
Took me three months.

00:20:38.903 --> 00:20:42.373 align:start size:94% position:6%
So I started to get better
at looking for food.

00:20:42.373 --> 00:20:44.675
And this is a typical good day,

00:20:44.675 --> 00:20:47.112
where I eat Pandanus spiralis.

00:20:48.313 --> 00:20:52.116
These are a bunch of
plants, spiky plant,

00:20:52.116 --> 00:20:54.519
really spiky, so
the way to eat this

00:20:54.519 --> 00:20:58.122 align:start size:88% position:13%
is to go in the
middle, with your legs,

00:20:58.122 --> 00:21:00.292
is not much easy way, right.

00:21:00.292 --> 00:21:04.763 align:start size:97% position:3%
You want the fresh, little,
young in the middle.

00:21:04.763 --> 00:21:08.100
So you take your hand, you
have to embrace the pain

00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:09.601
at one stage.

00:21:09.601 --> 00:21:13.372
So you go in the middle,
you grab the spiky thing,

00:21:14.772 --> 00:21:22.046
and then, quick fast go,
you collect the middle bit.

00:21:22.046 --> 00:21:25.917 align:start size:88% position:13%
And then, if you're
lucky, at the end of it,

00:21:25.917 --> 00:21:28.753 align:start size:94% position:6%
you've got two centimeters
to three centimeters

00:21:28.753 --> 00:21:30.656
of white chewing thing.

00:21:32.691 --> 00:21:35.860 align:start size:88% position:13%
And it's actually
fiber, you can eat that.

00:21:35.860 --> 00:21:38.696
And that will fill up my tummy.

00:21:38.696 --> 00:21:40.765
It's all about filling
the tummy, you know?

00:21:40.765 --> 00:21:44.069 align:start size:84% position:16%
I would walk 12 hours
a day, climbing,

00:21:44.069 --> 00:21:47.439 align:start size:84% position:16%
going through really
harsh terrain.

00:21:47.439 --> 00:21:49.574
And then I would
reach that tree.

00:21:49.574 --> 00:21:53.078
This tree would be on
my way all the time.

00:21:54.946 --> 00:21:57.448
What do you think about that?

00:21:57.448 --> 00:22:00.752
It's like a lot of fruit, right?

00:22:00.752 --> 00:22:03.021
So, I reached this tree,
and I look at the tree,

00:22:03.021 --> 00:22:04.222
I look on the ground.

00:22:04.222 --> 00:22:06.624 align:start size:88% position:13%
First thing, look on
the ground, no kangaroo,

00:22:06.624 --> 00:22:09.427
no birds eating that thing.

00:22:09.427 --> 00:22:13.064
There is no poo on the
bottom of that tree,

00:22:13.064 --> 00:22:16.134
no sign of anybody
using that tree.

00:22:16.134 --> 00:22:17.469
I don't like it.

00:22:19.037 --> 00:22:20.671
But I'm starving, you know?

00:22:20.671 --> 00:22:23.575
So, I'm looking at that tree,

00:22:23.575 --> 00:22:25.577 align:start size:81% position:19%
I'm thinking, well
you know what?

00:22:25.577 --> 00:22:29.915
I learn how to do things,
I'm good, you remember?

00:22:29.915 --> 00:22:31.149
At surviving.

00:22:31.149 --> 00:22:33.617
So, the rules is
to take the fruit,

00:22:33.617 --> 00:22:36.021
smash it in your wrists here,

00:22:37.222 --> 00:22:40.859
that's the most thin
skin that we've got,

00:22:40.859 --> 00:22:44.061
and then if there
is no reaction,

00:22:44.061 --> 00:22:46.297
you know the fruit
is kind of edible.

00:22:46.297 --> 00:22:48.399
Then you go phase number two,

00:22:48.399 --> 00:22:51.570
you put a bit of thing
inside your mouth here.

00:22:51.570 --> 00:22:53.972
No reaction, you can
go for the tongue.

00:22:53.972 --> 00:22:57.843 align:start size:88% position:13%
Wait four hours, because
some of those fruit,

00:22:57.843 --> 00:23:01.947 align:start size:97% position:3%
you need to wait for the
toxic to get out of the thing.

00:23:01.947 --> 00:23:04.382
If you kind of safe
after four hours,

00:23:04.382 --> 00:23:06.651 align:start size:84% position:16%
if you got no
tingling in the mouth,

00:23:06.651 --> 00:23:08.486
or in the tongue.

00:23:08.486 --> 00:23:09.987
I know that, right.

00:23:09.987 --> 00:23:12.157 align:start size:84% position:16%
So what I do, I get
there, take the fruit,

00:23:12.157 --> 00:23:15.994
squeeze a go, because
I don't feel like it.

00:23:15.994 --> 00:23:18.996
Because I'm really
starving, right.

00:23:18.996 --> 00:23:21.666
So I did that, it was like, oof,

00:23:22.934 --> 00:23:26.171
was like a Schweppes, like,
like a Schweppes on steroids,

00:23:27.939 --> 00:23:31.042 align:start size:84% position:16%
like, oh my god
this is disgusting,

00:23:31.042 --> 00:23:33.745
and I tried to spit it
out, and everything.

00:23:33.745 --> 00:23:36.581 align:start size:81% position:19%
And I was like,
wrong move, Sarah.

00:23:36.581 --> 00:23:38.149
Anyway, I passed that tree.

00:23:38.149 --> 00:23:41.252
And I keep, over
the days, I keep,

00:23:41.252 --> 00:23:43.855
having that tree on my journey,

00:23:46.757 --> 00:23:49.927
and every time I see that
tree I'm like frustrated.

00:23:49.927 --> 00:23:52.764 align:start size:97% position:3%
And one thing you don't want
is to get me frustrated.

00:23:52.764 --> 00:23:54.632
This is a do not do this.

00:23:54.632 --> 00:23:58.636
So, I get to that tree
again and I talk to him

00:23:58.636 --> 00:24:01.272
and say, "right, I know
you're not good for me,

00:24:01.272 --> 00:24:03.674 align:start size:81% position:19%
but let's try a
little bit again."

00:24:03.674 --> 00:24:06.310
And I squeeze again,
a little bit squeeze,

00:24:06.310 --> 00:24:08.847
and I start to kind of like it.

00:24:08.847 --> 00:24:10.449
You know, we think,

00:24:11.982 --> 00:24:13.685
we cannot get used to things,

00:24:13.685 --> 00:24:17.155
well we can get used
to a lot of things.

00:24:17.155 --> 00:24:18.857
You can get used to things

00:24:18.857 --> 00:24:21.959 align:start size:97% position:3%
I start to get used to
this really horrible taste.

00:24:21.959 --> 00:24:24.762
And one day, I was really tired,

00:24:24.762 --> 00:24:27.131
having one of those
really bad days.

00:24:27.131 --> 00:24:30.134
And I saw that tree
many times on my way

00:24:30.134 --> 00:24:33.538 align:start size:88% position:13%
during the hours
following this long day.

00:24:34.872 --> 00:24:35.774
And I keep,

00:24:36.908 --> 00:24:40.177 align:start size:84% position:16%
sitting under that
tree, and having a go,

00:24:40.177 --> 00:24:42.447
until when I start to stand up,

00:24:42.447 --> 00:24:45.750 align:start size:88% position:13%
I had this blurred
vision of the landscape.

00:24:45.750 --> 00:24:50.521
I'm thinking, oh, Sarah,
too much of a good thing,

00:24:50.521 --> 00:24:52.690
it's a bad thing, right?

00:24:52.690 --> 00:24:54.892
So I abused of this substance,

00:24:54.892 --> 00:24:56.628
and I lose my vision.

00:24:58.596 --> 00:25:01.833 align:start size:97% position:3%
So you learn, on the way,
also, I know a lot of things,

00:25:01.833 --> 00:25:03.401
but we learn on the way.

00:25:03.401 --> 00:25:07.339
The only way to learn is to
get out of our comfort zone,

00:25:08.506 --> 00:25:11.343
jump out, and be
here, and test it.

00:25:12.376 --> 00:25:14.945
This is the only way to grow.

00:25:14.945 --> 00:25:18.350
To get to that beautiful
people that we all are

00:25:18.350 --> 00:25:19.451
in this room.

00:25:20.584 --> 00:25:22.020
This is valuable for the lives,

00:25:22.020 --> 00:25:24.088
it's a life lesson.

00:25:24.088 --> 00:25:26.524
Get out there, and try.

00:25:26.524 --> 00:25:29.694
Don't stay in your own juice.

00:25:29.694 --> 00:25:31.729
This is my rule.

00:25:31.729 --> 00:25:34.265 align:start size:84% position:16%
Because, when you
know how to do things,

00:25:34.265 --> 00:25:37.035 align:start size:84% position:16%
you become a master
of what you do,

00:25:37.035 --> 00:25:38.035
and then what?

00:25:38.035 --> 00:25:39.904
It's boring, you don't grow.

00:25:39.904 --> 00:25:44.576
You start to be a bit,
uh, not a happy person.

00:25:44.576 --> 00:25:47.379
Hey, let's get out there,
try a few different things.

00:25:47.379 --> 00:25:50.282 align:start size:84% position:16%
You never know
what's going to happen.
