00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Well, the key to this problem was remembering that the distance is proportional to time squared.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
In two time intervals the time has doubled, which means the distance has quadrupled.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.000
If this was 0.8, the second second was 0.8 * 4 or 2².

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
That's 3.2 m.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Remember, I was asking for this distance and this distance is just 3.2 - 0.8, which is 2.4 m.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
The third time interval, well, this is 3 times longer than 1 interval,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
so 3² = 9, so it's going to be 9 times bigger.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
That means this distance is 9 * 0.8 or 7.2 m.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
But that's not the answer.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Once again, I wanted this part and that's 7.2 - 3.2, which is 4.0. Good work.
