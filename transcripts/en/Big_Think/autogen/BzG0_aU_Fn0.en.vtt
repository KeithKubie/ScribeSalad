right it's not just beauty

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570
right it's not just beauty
 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.599
right it's not just beauty
it could be beauty and intelligence and

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609
it could be beauty and intelligence and
 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.140
it could be beauty and intelligence and
so on but if you created this it was

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150
so on but if you created this it was
 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:25.339
so on but if you created this it was
mostly about beauty but you know if you

00:00:25.339 --> 00:00:25.349
mostly about beauty but you know if you
 

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:27.259
mostly about beauty but you know if you
created that it turns out that the most

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269
created that it turns out that the most
 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:28.970
created that it turns out that the most
attractive would date the most

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980
attractive would date the most
 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.650
attractive would date the most
attractive the middle attractive would

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660
attractive the middle attractive would
 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.269
attractive the middle attractive would
basically date the middle and the low

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279
basically date the middle and the low
 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:33.680
basically date the middle and the low
would they feel oh now there could be

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690
would they feel oh now there could be
 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.899
would they feel oh now there could be
slight deviations but that's what

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:35.909
slight deviations but that's what
 

00:00:35.909 --> 00:00:37.729
slight deviations but that's what
happened and why because if you're at

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739
happened and why because if you're at
 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.439
happened and why because if you're at
the top and you're a guy you can pick

00:00:39.439 --> 00:00:39.449
the top and you're a guy you can pick
 

00:00:39.449 --> 00:00:40.910
the top and you're a guy you can pick
anybody you want so you would pick a

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920
anybody you want so you would pick a
 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.380
anybody you want so you would pick a
woman who's on the top and if she's at

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390
woman who's on the top and if she's at
 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:43.939
woman who's on the top and if she's at
the top she could pick anybody she wants

00:00:43.939 --> 00:00:43.949
the top she could pick anybody she wants
 

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:45.770
the top she could pick anybody she wants
you will pick you so now the question is

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780
you will pick you so now the question is
 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.500
you will pick you so now the question is
what happens with people in the middle

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:47.510
what happens with people in the middle
 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:50.210
what happens with people in the middle
you know most of us what what happens to

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:50.220
you know most of us what what happens to
 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:51.560
you know most of us what what happens to
people in the middle how do we make

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570
people in the middle how do we make
 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.180
people in the middle how do we make
sense of where we are in the social

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190
sense of where we are in the social
 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:53.689
sense of where we are in the social
hierarchy

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699
hierarchy
 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.030
hierarchy
and for me that thought actually became

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:56.040
and for me that thought actually became
 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.579
and for me that thought actually became
very kind of crucial and apparent when I

00:00:58.579 --> 00:00:58.589
very kind of crucial and apparent when I
 

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:00.770
very kind of crucial and apparent when I
got injured so here's what happened you

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780
got injured so here's what happened you
 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.840
got injured so here's what happened you
you grow up and you have some kind of

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850
you grow up and you have some kind of
 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.579
you grow up and you have some kind of
space in society and you know basically

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589
space in society and you know basically
 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:05.960
space in society and you know basically
where you are and you know who would

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970
where you are and you know who would
 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.310
where you are and you know who would
date you and who would not date you who

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320
date you and who would not date you who
 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.680
date you and who would not date you who
is kind of outside of your league in

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:09.690
is kind of outside of your league in
 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:12.710
is kind of outside of your league in
general terms and you know where you fit

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720
general terms and you know where you fit
 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.740
general terms and you know where you fit
in the social hierarchy and and I knew

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750
in the social hierarchy and and I knew
 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.240
in the social hierarchy and and I knew
where I wasn't a social hierarchy but

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250
where I wasn't a social hierarchy but
 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.580
where I wasn't a social hierarchy but
one day I got badly injured and you know

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590
one day I got badly injured and you know
 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.020
one day I got badly injured and you know
I couldn't think about romantic stuff

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030
I couldn't think about romantic stuff
 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.470
I couldn't think about romantic stuff
for a long time but when I could office

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:24.480
for a long time but when I could office
 

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:26.000
for a long time but when I could office
and I start wondering about where do I

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:26.010
and I start wondering about where do I
 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:29.600
and I start wondering about where do I
fall now in the social hierarchy now

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610
fall now in the social hierarchy now
 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.100
fall now in the social hierarchy now
trying to think about do I fall in the

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110
trying to think about do I fall in the
 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.810
trying to think about do I fall in the
same place I'm kind of the same person

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820
same place I'm kind of the same person
 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.840
same place I'm kind of the same person
inside but I look much less attractive

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850
inside but I look much less attractive
 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.820
inside but I look much less attractive
right and with the women who would date

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:37.830
right and with the women who would date
 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:39.590
right and with the women who would date
me before would keep on dating me now

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600
me before would keep on dating me now
 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:40.820
me before would keep on dating me now
and I said why would they they have

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:40.830
and I said why would they they have
 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:42.470
and I said why would they they have
other options right I'm not the only guy

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:42.480
other options right I'm not the only guy
 

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:45.110
other options right I'm not the only guy
in the world okay so so it was kind of a

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:45.120
in the world okay so so it was kind of a
 

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:47.270
in the world okay so so it was kind of a
very difficult concept for me to think

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280
very difficult concept for me to think
 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.760
very difficult concept for me to think
about where do I fall like I felt

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770
about where do I fall like I felt
 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.380
about where do I fall like I felt
differently on the social hierarchy I

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390
differently on the social hierarchy I
 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.180
differently on the social hierarchy I
basically lost my space all of the time

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:53.190
basically lost my space all of the time
 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:55.040
basically lost my space all of the time
and I was trying to understand how these

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:55.050
and I was trying to understand how these
 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:57.469
and I was trying to understand how these
social dance happen and how we find our

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479
social dance happen and how we find our
 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.149
social dance happen and how we find our
place and I was really wondering about

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159
place and I was really wondering about
 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.100
place and I was really wondering about
where would I find my own mate where

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110
where would I find my own mate where
 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.320
where would I find my own mate where
would I fit in this in this scale and

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:03.330
would I fit in this in this scale and
 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:05.840
would I fit in this in this scale and
there's a lot of personal complexities

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850
there's a lot of personal complexities
 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.380
there's a lot of personal complexities
with it but eventually it led me to a

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390
with it but eventually it led me to a
 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.510
with it but eventually it led me to a
study and the study was really asking

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520
study and the study was really asking
 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.480
study and the study was really asking
the question of how do we make sense of

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:14.490
the question of how do we make sense of
 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:16.100
the question of how do we make sense of
what we fit in there in the

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110
what we fit in there in the
 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.980
what we fit in there in the
and they're basically kind of multiple

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990
and they're basically kind of multiple
 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:20.630
and they're basically kind of multiple
explanations right you could say you

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640
explanations right you could say you
 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.750
explanations right you could say you
never adjust you never if you kind of in

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760
never adjust you never if you kind of in
 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.210
never adjust you never if you kind of in
the middle range or the low range and

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220
the middle range or the low range and
 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.880
the middle range or the low range and
you only are you have to date somebody

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890
you only are you have to date somebody
 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:30.830
you only are you have to date somebody
else who's in the middle range you never

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840
else who's in the middle range you never
 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.080
else who's in the middle range you never
make peace with it you wake up every

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090
make peace with it you wake up every
 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.060
make peace with it you wake up every
morning you look at your partner across

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.070
morning you look at your partner across
 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:36.710
morning you look at your partner across
your shoulder and you say well that's

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720
your shoulder and you say well that's
 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.020
your shoulder and you say well that's
the best I could I really wanted more

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030
the best I could I really wanted more
 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.780
the best I could I really wanted more
sadly you know I have to admit my

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790
sadly you know I have to admit my
 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.370
sadly you know I have to admit my
limitations that's the most I could do

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380
limitations that's the most I could do
 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:46.700
limitations that's the most I could do
that means you don't adapt it could be

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:46.710
that means you don't adapt it could be
 

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:48.320
that means you don't adapt it could be
that you adapt it could be that for

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330
that you adapt it could be that for
 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.600
that you adapt it could be that for
example if you're unattractive you start

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610
example if you're unattractive you start
 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:52.070
example if you're unattractive you start
looking at other features that are

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080
looking at other features that are
 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.320
looking at other features that are
unattractive and see them is attractive

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330
unattractive and see them is attractive
 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:56.240
unattractive and see them is attractive
you remember the story from true love

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250
you remember the story from true love
 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.720
you remember the story from true love
when you have this this wolf Sydney say

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730
when you have this this wolf Sydney say
 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:01.460
when you have this this wolf Sydney say
grapes over the fence and he tries to

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470
grapes over the fence and he tries to
 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.050
grapes over the fence and he tries to
get them and he can't get them and

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060
get them and he can't get them and
 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.180
get them and he can't get them and
eventually said ah there was sour anyway

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190
eventually said ah there was sour anyway
 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:06.740
eventually said ah there was sour anyway
and he goes and eats something else

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750
and he goes and eats something else
 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:08.750
and he goes and eats something else
right so you could imagine that if

the first thing you can ask is do they
 

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:21.770
the first thing you can ask is do they
have different ratings are the people

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:21.780
have different ratings are the people
 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:24.350

not now it's not just rating it's about
 

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:01.460
not now it's not just rating it's about
also thinking about the probability that

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:01.470
also thinking about the probability that
 

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:04.100
also thinking about the probability that
you will be accepted or turn down and

line but it's still a little bit
 

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:10.610
line but it's still a little bit
embarrassing so the question is the

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:10.620
embarrassing so the question is the
 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:12.320
