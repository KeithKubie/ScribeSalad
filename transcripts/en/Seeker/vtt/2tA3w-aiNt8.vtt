00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.430
In the fall of 2017, we spotted an unexpected
visitor to our solar system from deep space.

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:06.780
We’d never seen anything like it!

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:10.560
It came out of nowhere, was on a surprising
trajectory, and it was MOVING FAST.

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:14.630
It wasn’t aliens, but it’s still just
fantastic.

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:15.920
This is Karen Meech.

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:20.140
I'm an astronomer at the Institute For Astronomy
University of Hawaii.

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:23.199
Her team spotted the UFO , and eventually:
Oumuamua.

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:25.770
It’s not aliens, it’s an asteroid.

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:27.000
But before you leave!

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.390
It’s an asteroid like none we’ve ever
observed before!

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:31.330
An asteroid from another star.

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:33.519
A piece of interstellar debris!

00:00:33.519 --> 00:00:39.589
When I first heard about the detection I was
very excited because we expected that these

00:00:39.589 --> 00:00:43.499
things should exist, but nobody had ever seen
one before.

00:00:43.499 --> 00:00:47.809
Imagine that our solar system is a fish tank,
and we’re in the middle of it.

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:51.789
So we’re looking at our fish tank and trying
to learn about the whole world outside of

00:00:51.789 --> 00:00:52.789
it too.

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:57.109
And then, suddenly and without warning something
gets thrown in to our tank and WHO KNOWS where

00:00:57.109 --> 00:00:58.109
that thing is from?!

00:00:58.109 --> 00:00:59.129
It’s completely different stuff!

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:00.129
From a whole different place!

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:01.129
ARE YOU EXCITED YET?

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:02.129
I KNOW RIGHT?!

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:03.410
That’s what happened here.

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:05.049
So here’s what we know…

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:10.640
We know that it is not from our solar system
based on the path it took through the solar

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:11.640
system.

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.420
We know it is the size of a football field,
and it’s rotating rapidly.

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:18.090
We also know, based on its orbit, where it
came from and where it is going.

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.030
We know it’s got no dust coming off it,
and it’s not icy, so it’s not a comet!

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:23.289
We know its color!

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:24.360
It’s RED!

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.430
Well, kinda.

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:26.430
Yes.

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:31.860
Well when you say red, people instantly picture
something red in color.

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:38.140
But what we mean astronomically is that it
more efficiently reflects the red light than

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:39.470
the blue light.

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:44.860
And so it may not necessarily look red, and
in fact we think this object is very dark.

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:50.700
And so it's just varying amounts of a very
dark surface reflecting the blue or the red

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:51.840
end of the spectrum.

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.280
Also, the shape was very unusual.

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.979
It was not what we were expecting.

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:59.840
For example, observations told us it’s 10
times longer than it is wide, but that’s

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:00.840
the Lower limit.

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:01.840
Yeah.

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.359
It’s 10 to 1…

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:05.240
At bare minimum.

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:11.730
The reason I say bare minimum is we were assuming
that the rotation axis was perpendicular to

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:12.950
our line of sight.

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:14.790
And we don't know that.

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:20.409
If the rotation axis were pointing at us as
in -- it’s spinning like a rectangular platter,

00:02:20.409 --> 00:02:23.060
you can’t tell how big it really is!

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:27.959
If it's tilted over you can foreshortening,
in which case it could even be longer than

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:28.959
10 to 1.

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:33.129
And the only way to figure that out would
be to get its rotational light curve over

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:37.980
a long period of time and get it at all sorts
of different viewing angles, and we didn't

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:38.980
have that luxury.

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:42.290
They didn’t have that luxury, because they
didn’t know it was coming.

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:47.081
The asteroid was so shocking, Earth astronomers
didn’t even know it was there until it had

00:02:47.081 --> 00:02:48.740
passed the sun already!

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:52.050
Which means astronomers around the world were
in a bit of a race against time.

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:55.580
You have to realize we had very little time
to observe it.

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:02.329
From time at which we realized what it was
until it was really too faint to do much science

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:06.069
to characterize it was less than about two
weeks.

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:10.250
if it hadn't come as close to the sun as it
did its path would have just been a straight

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:14.780
line through the solar system, but it got
close enough to the sun that the sun acts

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:16.750
like a gravitational slingshot

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:22.529
And that slingshot it really what saved us,
in terms of giving us time to do some science.

00:03:22.529 --> 00:03:28.140
And normally you spend, you might spend a
month or so writing a careful proposal to

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:32.210
get telescope time that you would be awarded
six months later.

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:35.000
You get the data, you carefully analyze it.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.909
So this was a real time crunch.

00:03:36.909 --> 00:03:41.110
On top of that we know the surface of the
asteroid was bombarded by cosmic rays for

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:42.860
millions upon millions of years!

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:43.860
24.

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:47.959
In the end, the biggest discovery here isn’t
what we learned about Oumuamua, but that the

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:50.579
asteroid existed in the first place.

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:53.689
This is this tells us that they're out there
and there's probably a lot of them.

00:03:53.689 --> 00:03:54.689
Before we wrap up here.

00:03:54.689 --> 00:03:59.500
There are projects pointing telescopes at
Oumuamua to determine if it’s an interstellar

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:01.900
probe, or some kind of spacecraft.

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:04.480
I get that, it’s not been ruled out.

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:08.860
And I asked Karen what she thought and … well,
she had some feels.

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:12.770
Proving that it's not artificial, if there
was intelligence behind it would be really

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:13.770
difficult.

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:18.530
But this is entirely consistent with a natural
trajectory.

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:24.950
Now if it had deviated from this path suddenly,
that would be a good indication it's not natural,

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:26.890
but it didn't do that.

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:31.150
The surface materials are consistent with
natural things in the solar system, but so

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:32.150
is metal.

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:33.150
So that's not proving things one way or another.

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:34.150
It's consistent with being natural.

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:35.150
The size is consistent with being natural.

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:41.060
Just because we can't explain the elongated
shape doesn't mean it has to have an unnatural

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:42.440
explanation.

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:47.470
So given that it's entirely consistent, yeah
if you were gonna go out on the edge and say

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:50.850
it's something extraordinary you better have
extraordinary proof.

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:57.750
And given that it's totally consistent with
a natural object there's no proof of anything.

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:02.130
So now we know intergalactic objects do occasionally
fall into our little fish tank, and hopefully,

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:07.150
next time, we’ll know what to look for and
get even more data, and this armchair twitter

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:10.410
astronomer will be ready to heart every bit
of it.

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:13.400
Thanks for watching Seeker, make sure you
come back again for more videos, and if you

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:16.690
have suggestions for more topics, we’re
always looking, so let us know!

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:21.360
One last fun fact from Dr. Meech she got excited
about science by watching Star Trek with her

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:22.340
parents.

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:23.260
Same Karen.

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:23.820
Same.
