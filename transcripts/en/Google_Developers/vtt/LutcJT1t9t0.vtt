BRAHIM ELBOUCHIKHI: Good
afternoon, everybody.

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:03.360
My name is Brahim Elbouchikhi.

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:05.930
I'm a product manager
on the Daydream team,

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:09.670
and I'm responsible
for Play Store VR.

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:14.080
I've been pretty fortunate to
work on ecosystem formation

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:15.800
for the past five years.

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:17.590
Before this, I
was on Google Play

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:20.480
for four years, where I
led monetization, search,

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:22.140
and discovery.

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:23.930
And I don't know how
many of you remember

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:26.300
Android Market, and then
within Android market,

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:30.260
the 10B sale, which is when
we turned all the apps to be

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.410
10 cents and then we had a
sale, and all this good stuff.

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:35.660
And I don't know if you
remember-- the store fell over

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:37.220
within like two
hours of the sale

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:39.170
because we couldn't
handle the traffic.

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:42.760
And that was a really bad
day for me and my team.

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.180
Now, we've come a long
way from there, right?

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.267
So Google Play is a much
more stable platform.

00:00:47.267 --> 00:00:48.850
We've got payments
all over the world,

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:50.250
we've got users
spending billions

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.100
of dollars buying your content.

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.200
We've come a long way,
and what attracted

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:57.800
me to come into VR and
Daydream is the opportunities

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.590
to work with you again to figure
out some similar questions,

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:03.090
but in an entirely
different context.

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.519
If you think of back
then, we were thinking

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.300
of how will I monetize my app?

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:09.150
How will I keep my users around?

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.940
How do I do a user acquisition?

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:13.720
What content would
actually stick?

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.320
And those questions are
very much open today in VR.

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:20.860
They are an entirely
open field for us

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:23.810
as a group to figure
out, and to build

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:29.690
those big brands in VR and on
Daydream as we have on mobile.

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:33.140
So the hope is that
if in five years,

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.660
we're collectively working on
another frontier technology,

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:38.960
that we can look back
and then say again

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.750
that we've created value,
that we went past the hype

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.460
and actually delivered
real value for users,

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.460
and built a multibillion
dollar business on Daydream.

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:49.290
That's the goal.

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.150
That's why we had
this session today.

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:54.360
And I can't wait to kind of
get started and kind of start

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.060
working with you on this.

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:59.600
So a recap of Daydream, right?

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.290
So you've heard this from
Clay at the first keynote

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:03.500
this morning.

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.680
Daydream is just
incredibly exciting for us

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:08.270
to start to tell you
the story of Daydream.

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:10.389
I have been working on
it for quite some time,

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:13.730
and the team has been incredibly
thoughtful about thinking

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.780
about the various aspects
that create a high quality VR

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:18.760
experience.

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.740
So we've got the
smartphone, which

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:23.750
is at the core of the
experience, obviously.

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:25.990
We've got a headset
that's comfortable,

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:28.290
we've got a controller
that can allow

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.407
you to create really immersive
and awesome experiences,

00:02:31.407 --> 00:02:32.990
and then you've got
the apps, which is

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:34.510
what we're here to talk about.

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:38.410
That's where we fit
in in this talk.

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:40.440
Now, just before we
get started, it's

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.880
important to step back and
talk about Google Play.

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:45.490
I mentioned it's
a stable platform,

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:48.211
and Daydream is essentially
built on top of Google Play.

00:02:48.211 --> 00:02:48.710
Right?

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:50.520
It's our distribution platform.

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.770
We, in a way, get
it for free, which

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:55.000
is an amazing asset to have.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.250
We got ahead 190 countries
where you distribute

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:00.340
free apps, 130 countries
where you can sell your apps,

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.640
and we've got the one
billion 30-day active users

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.220
that Google Play has.

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.880
Now, before anybody
yells it out,

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:09.390
those are not VR users today.

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:11.500
I'm not trying to
make that claim.

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.410
What I am going to say is
that at Daydream, we're

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:17.220
trying to operate
at Android scale.

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:20.220
That our intention is to
operate at Android scale,

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:24.940
meaning hundreds of millions of
users using Daydream devices.

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:29.010
And the way we get there is
through the typical smartphone

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:31.990
evolution where today's
premium devices,

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:34.460
the ones that can
run VR experiences,

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:38.210
are next year's mid-range,
and the following year's

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:40.610
potentially even
low end devices.

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:42.920
So if you take
that evolution, you

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:45.510
can see that in a
couple years, we

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:48.510
will have hundreds
of millions of users

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:50.820
on Daydream-ready
devices that are

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:54.250
ready to consume the mobile
VR experiences that you all

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:55.640
are going to build.

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:57.200
But the main point
is the intention

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:59.590
is to operate at
Android scale, to have

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:02.970
an ecosystem of devices,
of content creators,

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:06.230
and of partners creating
headsets and controllers.

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:06.730
All right.

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:12.290
So with that in mind,
I remember back then,

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:14.640
I used to meet a lot of
developers for mobile

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:16.500
and we used to have a
lot of conversations

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:19.880
around monetization,
discovery, et cetera.

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:21.589
And in this talk,
we tried to try

00:04:21.589 --> 00:04:24.860
to get ahead of some of those
questions that you have.

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:26.920
We tried to pull user
studies that we've

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:30.270
had with some fairly large
numbers of users of mobile VR

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:32.990
and distill those into insights
that can be useful to you

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:35.910
at this stage of
your app development.

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:38.260
We've also looked at
data that we have,

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.320
and we've talked to many
of you, and we've also

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:42.480
talked honestly
amongst ourselves

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:45.456
and debated for a long,
long time to say, OK.

00:04:45.456 --> 00:04:46.830
Based on our
expertise, we've got

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:48.788
people coming from console
world, people coming

00:04:48.788 --> 00:04:50.810
from mobile, people
coming from all sorts

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:53.010
of different
backgrounds thinking

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:58.370
about how is VR potentially
going to evolve from here.

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:00.629
Nobody knows the answers
to a lot of these things,

00:05:00.629 --> 00:05:02.670
but we hope that these
insights can at least help

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:05.000
get the conversation
going and help us thinking

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.991
about the right set of things.

00:05:06.991 --> 00:05:07.490
All right.

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:09.590
So with that, I'm going
to jump in and talk

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:12.510
about the first insight.

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:13.260
OK.

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:16.960
So with mobile, you're
generally dealing

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:19.190
with a fairly distracted user.

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:20.970
They are at a bus station.

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:23.990
They are waiting for a
friend and killing some time.

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:27.020
They're interacting with your
app multiple times a day,

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:29.960
but fairly in short
interactions, a couple minutes.

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:30.640
Right?

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:33.190
And because of that,
mobile has evolved

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:35.530
into free-to-play mechanics,
and all sorts of things

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:38.690
that kind of have derived
from that user behavior.

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:40.480
That's great.

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:42.210
When you think of
mobile VR, it's

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:44.380
an entirely different setting.

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:47.300
Our studies showed that
users are spending 30 minutes

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:50.400
plus in each session,
that they're also

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:54.740
having a single session a day,
not multiple sessions a day,

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:56.191
that they're doing this at home.

00:05:56.191 --> 00:05:58.190
No one is wearing these
headsets in the streets.

00:05:58.190 --> 00:05:59.590
Just FYI.

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:00.090
Right?

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:01.350
Nobody is.

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:03.050
Probably nobody will.

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:05.312
It's at home, long sessions.

00:06:05.312 --> 00:06:06.770
Actually, we've
had photos of users

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:08.811
that kind of like lean
back, kind of like they're

00:06:08.811 --> 00:06:09.650
watching TV.

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:11.420
That's the state of
mind of the user.

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:14.580
They're waiting to be, in
a way, kind of immersed

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:17.555
to be drawn into really
rich content that

00:06:17.555 --> 00:06:21.110
has a lot of narrative, and
they're in that state of mind.

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:23.970
And so as you build
your apps, the way

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:26.030
we try to synthesize
this is to say,

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:29.500
think a sit down
meal, not a snack.

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:31.920
And sit down meals come
with certain expectations

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:37.510
of duration, of deliciousness
of the food, and also of cost.

00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:40.290
So when you design
your app, while we

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:42.400
think of mobile as
a snack, mobile VR

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:44.590
is more of a sit down meal.

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:46.131
Just as a thing.

00:06:46.131 --> 00:06:46.630
All right.

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:49.860
So the second insight.

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:50.880
This is an old chart.

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:52.640
I used this chart
for a couple of years

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:56.080
now to demonstrate the
importance of quality

00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:57.554
to monetization.

00:06:57.554 --> 00:06:58.970
And it's totally
intuitive, right?

00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:01.010
If you build higher
quality content,

00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:03.029
you will have more monetization.

00:07:03.029 --> 00:07:03.820
You will make more.

00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:05.480
People will pay more for that.

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:06.990
Nothing surprising here.

00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:09.150
The scale is a bit surprising.

00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:12.350
And in VR, we all know
that quality's going

00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:13.434
to be even more important.

00:07:13.434 --> 00:07:13.933
Right?

00:07:13.933 --> 00:07:16.250
It's an order of magnitude,
probably, more important,

00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:18.240
because you can literally
make people feel bad,

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:20.810
like physically sick.

00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:23.710
So Alice is going to dive
into this much more later,

00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:28.440
so what I want to talk about,
however, is first impressions.

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:33.400
So as an industry, we're
in those early days, right?

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:37.570
And we have a ton of first
time users coming through.

00:07:37.570 --> 00:07:41.136
And each time a first time user
experiences one of your apps,

00:07:41.136 --> 00:07:42.510
there are two ways
it can happen.

00:07:42.510 --> 00:07:43.635
Two things that can happen.

00:07:43.635 --> 00:07:46.210
They can either become an
advocate for the industry,

00:07:46.210 --> 00:07:48.640
and spread the industry and
the fact that it's awesome,

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:51.220
and tell their friends and
family that, hey, VR is here.

00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:51.970
It's real.

00:07:51.970 --> 00:07:53.640
It's awesome.

00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:57.120
Or, they can either
confirm their skepticism

00:07:57.120 --> 00:08:00.260
or become a skeptic by
saying it's not ready,

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:03.670
and potentially walking
away from VR for years.

00:08:03.670 --> 00:08:07.430
For us as an industry,
not just for that one app.

00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:10.580
And so the insight is,
as you design your apps,

00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:11.390
think of that.

00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:13.350
Think of the fact that
many of our users,

00:08:13.350 --> 00:08:16.970
as we move into the mainstream,
are first time users.

00:08:16.970 --> 00:08:19.260
Meaning that the experience
needs to hand-hold them

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:22.350
through what VR is, to
not like immediately

00:08:22.350 --> 00:08:25.831
drop them in the deep
end of a VR experience,

00:08:25.831 --> 00:08:27.830
to make sure you introduce
them to these things,

00:08:27.830 --> 00:08:30.030
to the mechanics,
to the experience.

00:08:30.030 --> 00:08:33.780
Be thoughtful about it, and
know that we're collectively

00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:36.650
responsible for the
success of the industry.

00:08:36.650 --> 00:08:37.460
Right?

00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:40.890
If these things don't
catch, if the word of mouth

00:08:40.890 --> 00:08:42.870
doesn't allow people
to get excited,

00:08:42.870 --> 00:08:45.240
the people don't
speak well of VR,

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:47.590
we won't have a
successful industry.

00:08:47.590 --> 00:08:51.100
So that's the second
thing I wanted to share.

00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:55.320
The third thing
is about novelty.

00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:57.930
And VR is incredibly
novel right now.

00:08:57.930 --> 00:08:58.430
Right?

00:08:58.430 --> 00:09:00.820
I mean, one of the most
fun things you can do in VR

00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:03.450
is show VR to people who've
never seen it before.

00:09:03.450 --> 00:09:03.950
Right?

00:09:03.950 --> 00:09:05.950
I mean, literally, demoing
VR is one of the most

00:09:05.950 --> 00:09:08.490
fun you can do in VR.

00:09:08.490 --> 00:09:11.720
And it's really easy
and somewhat tempting

00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:15.840
to just say, oh, I'm going to
drop someone somewhere amazing

00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:17.650
and be like, that's awesome.

00:09:17.650 --> 00:09:19.330
That's a great experience.

00:09:19.330 --> 00:09:21.870
That is a great
experience for 30 seconds.

00:09:21.870 --> 00:09:23.890
And then as soon as
you achieve presence

00:09:23.890 --> 00:09:26.880
and you achieve like, oh my god,
I'm in space, you're like, OK.

00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:28.354
What can I do?

00:09:28.354 --> 00:09:31.020
You look around again and you're
like, oh, can I touch anything?

00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:31.840
No.

00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:34.540
And users don't engage further.

00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:37.160
Users will not pay for novelty.

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:39.120
Users will not pay for novelty.

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:41.250
Users pay for
engaging experiences.

00:09:41.250 --> 00:09:43.390
And so when we designed
the Daydream controller,

00:09:43.390 --> 00:09:45.080
we had this
specifically in mind.

00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:47.370
We wanted to give you
a tool that you can

00:09:47.370 --> 00:09:49.600
use to create engaging content.

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:51.610
So if you're going
to drop me in space,

00:09:51.610 --> 00:09:55.190
make sure I can point at any
planet and learn about it.

00:09:55.190 --> 00:09:59.840
Or maybe I can grab a planet
and toss it out of the galaxy.

00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:04.060
Help me do something there and
go beyond the novelty of VR,

00:10:04.060 --> 00:10:09.360
because that's the easy
path is to use the novelty.

00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:11.512
The fourth insight.

00:10:11.512 --> 00:10:12.474
Ah.

00:10:12.474 --> 00:10:13.920
Oh.

00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:14.880
I went too far.

00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:19.540
OK, so the fourth insight is
about-- I learned this actually

00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:21.910
when I was in mobile,
and on the Play Store,

00:10:21.910 --> 00:10:23.620
we used to get a
lot of people that

00:10:23.620 --> 00:10:26.970
run these queries like a
search query that says game.

00:10:26.970 --> 00:10:28.330
App.

00:10:28.330 --> 00:10:29.407
That's it.

00:10:29.407 --> 00:10:31.490
And we struggle with what--
that's there-- there's

00:10:31.490 --> 00:10:32.700
very little intent there.

00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:35.990
There's very little we can do
to help the user in the search

00:10:35.990 --> 00:10:38.996
results, because
it's so high level.

00:10:38.996 --> 00:10:40.620
And we've learned
that that's basically

00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:42.920
new users who don't understand
what their device is

00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:45.070
capable of, or new
users who don't

00:10:45.070 --> 00:10:48.000
know how to search for things.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.420
What are the words I need
to put to actually search

00:10:50.420 --> 00:10:52.420
for the right content?

00:10:52.420 --> 00:10:54.410
And the insight
here is, I believe

00:10:54.410 --> 00:10:57.540
that the entire industry
in VR is in that stage,

00:10:57.540 --> 00:11:01.930
that we all-- there's no
evolved, clear taxonomy of how

00:11:01.930 --> 00:11:04.260
we describe these
experiences and these apps.

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:07.480
We don't have clear
expectations of what

00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:10.980
actually can be achieved in VR.

00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:14.920
For example, a
teleportation app.

00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:17.190
Is that a travel app?

00:11:17.190 --> 00:11:20.540
It could be, but I doubt anybody
will search for travel app

00:11:20.540 --> 00:11:22.870
when they want to find
a teleportation app.

00:11:22.870 --> 00:11:25.760
So because of that, what
you need to think of

00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:28.310
is that users are in their
window shopping mode,

00:11:28.310 --> 00:11:30.870
not in a grocery shopping mode.

00:11:30.870 --> 00:11:33.390
And what that means is,
we've gotten used in mobile

00:11:33.390 --> 00:11:35.720
now where users come with
a specific thing they're

00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:36.960
looking for.

00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:38.470
They go and they
type specifically

00:11:38.470 --> 00:11:39.550
what they're looking for.

00:11:39.550 --> 00:11:41.230
Most users are at
that stage now,

00:11:41.230 --> 00:11:43.770
because they're familiar with
what a smartphone can do.

00:11:43.770 --> 00:11:45.660
But in VR, a lot of
users are going to come

00:11:45.660 --> 00:11:47.889
and they're going to wait
to be dazzled by the app.

00:11:47.889 --> 00:11:48.680
What is this about?

00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:49.660
What can it do?

00:11:49.660 --> 00:11:52.910
So as you design, whether in
the store, in the Play Store,

00:11:52.910 --> 00:11:55.350
or out on the web, or
your YouTube trailers,

00:11:55.350 --> 00:11:58.280
your 360 trailers for your
app-- whatever you do,

00:11:58.280 --> 00:12:01.710
make sure you realize that
the users' state of mind when

00:12:01.710 --> 00:12:04.570
they are looking for
apps at this point in VR

00:12:04.570 --> 00:12:06.180
is very undefined.

00:12:06.180 --> 00:12:07.260
It's very high level.

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:10.160
They're kind of more on the
receiving end, browsing, window

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:10.970
shopping.

00:12:10.970 --> 00:12:12.428
They don't know
something specific.

00:12:12.428 --> 00:12:15.620
They're not looking
for something specific.

00:12:15.620 --> 00:12:17.480
So that's another one.

00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:26.610
The fifth insight is that VR
is meant to be experienced.

00:12:26.610 --> 00:12:31.280
And I'm going to unpack
it for you a bit.

00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:33.090
A lot of technologies,
it's really easy

00:12:33.090 --> 00:12:34.720
to describe them in words.

00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:37.220
So for example, if you go
to describe 3D printing

00:12:37.220 --> 00:12:40.340
to someone, you could
just say, well, you know,

00:12:40.340 --> 00:12:42.910
this thing was made,
probably in China,

00:12:42.910 --> 00:12:44.790
and then it got
shipped to your house.

00:12:44.790 --> 00:12:48.040
Instead of that, you can have a
CAD model and you can hit Print

00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:50.116
and it just shows
up at your home.

00:12:50.116 --> 00:12:50.990
Right on the printer.

00:12:50.990 --> 00:12:51.490
Right?

00:12:51.490 --> 00:12:54.250
And the people kind of
get what it's about.

00:12:54.250 --> 00:12:56.740
Now, when you try to
describe VR to someone,

00:12:56.740 --> 00:12:59.514
you tell them, well, you
feel like you're there.

00:12:59.514 --> 00:13:01.680
And they kind of look at
you and they're like, well,

00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:03.222
but I'm not there.

00:13:03.222 --> 00:13:05.180
But then you say, well,
no, but then, you know,

00:13:05.180 --> 00:13:09.002
you're-- we have two different
images in your eyes, we have--

00:13:09.002 --> 00:13:10.960
we introduce parallax,
as so you can see depth.

00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:13.810
And then you have head tracking,
and motion and photo on just

00:13:13.810 --> 00:13:15.340
for fun.

00:13:15.340 --> 00:13:18.590
And you talk about all
these things and the user,

00:13:18.590 --> 00:13:22.200
they don't really get
it, most of the time.

00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:25.680
And so what you need is you need
someone to experience your app.

00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:28.649
They need to actually be in it
to understand what it's about.

00:13:28.649 --> 00:13:29.690
And this doesn't go away.

00:13:29.690 --> 00:13:32.550
This actually stays for
every single experience

00:13:32.550 --> 00:13:36.350
that I'm going to try to engage
with, or buy, or install.

00:13:36.350 --> 00:13:40.180
I'm going to want to
experience it before I do that.

00:13:40.180 --> 00:13:44.960
So the insight here is,
make sure you give users

00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:48.000
ways to try and
experience your app

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.750
before they have to
increase their commitment.

00:13:50.750 --> 00:13:53.330
So if it's basically
a large install,

00:13:53.330 --> 00:13:56.420
if I have to download
500 megs Before I even

00:13:56.420 --> 00:13:59.560
know what your thing is
about, I'm not going to do it.

00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:02.220
If potentially I
need to pay upfront

00:14:02.220 --> 00:14:06.450
without even seeing a 360
YouTube trailer about your app,

00:14:06.450 --> 00:14:08.040
I may not do it.

00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:11.070
So think about ways that
you can introduce the user

00:14:11.070 --> 00:14:14.490
to what your experience
is about before asking

00:14:14.490 --> 00:14:15.868
them to take that next step.

00:14:19.090 --> 00:14:23.390
Our final insight here is
about purchasing and purchasing

00:14:23.390 --> 00:14:23.890
behavior.

00:14:26.387 --> 00:14:27.970
If you look back at
everything we just

00:14:27.970 --> 00:14:30.300
talked about now,
the fact that you

00:14:30.300 --> 00:14:35.780
have a single session a day, the
fact that you have a user who's

00:14:35.780 --> 00:14:38.790
immersed-- meaning that
purchasing is going to probably

00:14:38.790 --> 00:14:39.770
break that immersion.

00:14:39.770 --> 00:14:41.326
It's going to get in the way.

00:14:41.326 --> 00:14:43.200
If you think about a
lot of these things that

00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:46.230
make VR so awesome,
you're not going

00:14:46.230 --> 00:14:48.760
to want to have things like
free-to-play mechanics, energy

00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:50.850
mechanics, time-based mechanics.

00:14:50.850 --> 00:14:54.500
It's just not going to
work, in all likelihood.

00:14:54.500 --> 00:14:55.650
Things may change.

00:14:55.650 --> 00:14:58.510
But it's going to be hard.

00:14:58.510 --> 00:15:01.130
And so what we're recommending
is an experience where

00:15:01.130 --> 00:15:04.880
a user is able to
unlock the entire thing

00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:09.770
with a single purchase, and that
purchase can be an in-app where

00:15:09.770 --> 00:15:11.770
basically, I try
a couple levels,

00:15:11.770 --> 00:15:14.910
I get what your app is
about, I experience it,

00:15:14.910 --> 00:15:17.620
and then I make a
purchase to unlock

00:15:17.620 --> 00:15:19.270
the remainder of the app.

00:15:19.270 --> 00:15:23.210
That balances out both the I
need to try it before I buy,

00:15:23.210 --> 00:15:26.860
but it also does not disrupt the
experience on a regular basis.

00:15:26.860 --> 00:15:29.620
It doesn't try that recurring
monetization loop that's

00:15:29.620 --> 00:15:33.900
become so familiar in mobile.

00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:34.400
OK.

00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:39.480
So to summarize, we would
like you to build high quality

00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:43.820
content that has
narrative, that's

00:15:43.820 --> 00:15:47.650
equivalent to a beautiful,
awesome book that draws you in

00:15:47.650 --> 00:15:50.260
and that you can't put down.

00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:53.300
We want you to engage
with users beyond novelty,

00:15:53.300 --> 00:15:56.230
because no one pays for novelty.

00:15:56.230 --> 00:15:58.350
If you find someone,
let me know.

00:15:58.350 --> 00:16:02.660
Let users try your
experience before they

00:16:02.660 --> 00:16:05.870
need to take that next
step of commitment.

00:16:05.870 --> 00:16:09.380
And finally, think of
ways to allow a user

00:16:09.380 --> 00:16:12.362
to make a single purchase to
unlock an entire experience.

00:16:15.140 --> 00:16:20.310
Keeping in mind that free to
play may be challenged in VR.

00:16:20.310 --> 00:16:21.840
OK.

00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:26.230
So with that, I want to move on
to the next part of this talk,

00:16:26.230 --> 00:16:29.290
which is Play Store in VR.

00:16:29.290 --> 00:16:31.030
You've seen some of
these bits and pieces

00:16:31.030 --> 00:16:32.650
through the keynotes
and the videos

00:16:32.650 --> 00:16:34.066
and all that sort
of stuff, so I'm

00:16:34.066 --> 00:16:36.100
going to go through
them fairly quickly.

00:16:39.950 --> 00:16:42.220
This is what we
call Daydream Home.

00:16:42.220 --> 00:16:44.640
When the user boots into
VR, they're automatically

00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:47.330
dropped into this environment.

00:16:47.330 --> 00:16:50.620
The one thing I want to
highlight here is the icon.

00:16:50.620 --> 00:16:52.900
People are familiar
with the Play Store.

00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:56.500
This is the same place
I get my 2D apps,

00:16:56.500 --> 00:16:59.368
it's the same place that
I make my purchases,

00:16:59.368 --> 00:17:01.618
and it's the same place I'm
going to do it here in VR.

00:17:06.690 --> 00:17:08.140
Now, I don't know
if we'll launch

00:17:08.140 --> 00:17:09.598
with this background
in particular,

00:17:09.598 --> 00:17:12.349
but I got to tell you that
the team is thinking really

00:17:12.349 --> 00:17:15.640
about fun spaces
that are unusual,

00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:18.819
that are representative
of the immersion of VR,

00:17:18.819 --> 00:17:22.670
that just create a really
nice feel and really fun feel.

00:17:22.670 --> 00:17:24.630
So they explain a
lot of those things.

00:17:24.630 --> 00:17:26.920
And of course, 2D
does it no justice

00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:31.920
in terms of when you see a 2D
screen shot of a VR experience,

00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:33.870
again, going back to
the earlier point.

00:17:33.870 --> 00:17:37.890
So what you notice here is
content is front and center.

00:17:37.890 --> 00:17:38.390
Right?

00:17:38.390 --> 00:17:40.240
This is our featured
port in the store,

00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:42.460
and you have that
beautiful poster

00:17:42.460 --> 00:17:45.890
that has depth, that allows
somebody to kind of get

00:17:45.890 --> 00:17:48.750
into what is this about,
as much as we can, at least

00:17:48.750 --> 00:17:51.300
at this stage.

00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:52.900
You also see the
store representing

00:17:52.900 --> 00:17:56.010
what I talked about in terms
of the lack of categories

00:17:56.010 --> 00:17:57.180
or taxonomy.

00:17:57.180 --> 00:18:00.540
At launch, it's going
to be pretty simple.

00:18:00.540 --> 00:18:04.087
You're not going to see tons
of categories, different words

00:18:04.087 --> 00:18:04.920
being thrown around.

00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:08.040
It's going to be simple, and
we need to keep it simple.

00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:09.810
At the bottom, we
have four sections.

00:18:09.810 --> 00:18:12.380
The Featured section,
which is curated.

00:18:12.380 --> 00:18:14.120
You've got the
Popular section, which

00:18:14.120 --> 00:18:16.990
is top charts, essentially,
and then you have two homes

00:18:16.990 --> 00:18:19.440
for apps and for games.

00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:22.670
As we learn more about what
sort of content types--

00:18:22.670 --> 00:18:24.700
and Alice is going to
talk more about that--

00:18:24.700 --> 00:18:28.460
are going to emerge, we
will have the store evolve,

00:18:28.460 --> 00:18:33.210
but to start with, we're
starting and keeping it simple.

00:18:33.210 --> 00:18:35.640
Next is Popular, right?

00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:41.030
So even here, we're given a lot
more space for a single item.

00:18:41.030 --> 00:18:42.750
It's not so much
of the compressed,

00:18:42.750 --> 00:18:44.730
let's have a whole chart
stacked up together

00:18:44.730 --> 00:18:47.400
so we can fit as many things
as we can on the screen.

00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:49.030
Here, even though
we have more space,

00:18:49.030 --> 00:18:51.380
we're actually showing
fewer things at a time.

00:18:51.380 --> 00:18:53.860
Because again, that window
shopping experience.

00:18:53.860 --> 00:18:57.460
We want someone to be able to
understand what your app is

00:18:57.460 --> 00:19:00.640
about one at a time and
just really kind of get

00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:04.450
to the next level of commitment,
hopefully, making a purchase

00:19:04.450 --> 00:19:05.440
or installing the app.

00:19:07.950 --> 00:19:09.580
Lindsay this morning
also showed us

00:19:09.580 --> 00:19:13.357
this, which is the Details page.

00:19:13.357 --> 00:19:14.940
And the thing I want
to highlight here

00:19:14.940 --> 00:19:18.750
is the photosphere, that 360
degree stereoscopic image.

00:19:18.750 --> 00:19:20.480
We're doing this,
again, to try to help

00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:22.650
with the trying the experience.

00:19:22.650 --> 00:19:24.650
I don't think this is
necessarily like entirely

00:19:24.650 --> 00:19:27.900
trying it, but it gets us
one step closer to the user

00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:31.090
being able to look around
and see what this is about.

00:19:31.090 --> 00:19:34.720
Having tried this, it really
is effective in making

00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:38.560
sure you understand what
this app is about as a user.

00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:41.710
So we're doing
this and every app

00:19:41.710 --> 00:19:46.440
will need to submit this
particular photosphere.

00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:49.620
Finally, we will support
in-app purchases,

00:19:49.620 --> 00:19:52.430
and they will work exactly as
you would expect them to work.

00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:56.370
All right.

00:19:56.370 --> 00:20:02.260
So Cardboard apps were
about fun, snackable,

00:20:02.260 --> 00:20:06.640
short experiences, largely
non-interactive, right?

00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:10.480
The one button, they
were kept very simple.

00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:13.600
Daydream apps are
quite the opposite.

00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:19.680
They're about immersive content,
long form, highly interactive.

00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:23.390
The Daydream controller
is key to the last bit.

00:20:23.390 --> 00:20:25.660
And the best metaphor
that I can think

00:20:25.660 --> 00:20:29.990
of for it is a book that
is incredibly awesome that

00:20:29.990 --> 00:20:33.900
draws you in, and
that you get lost in.

00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:35.380
It's happened to
every one of us,

00:20:35.380 --> 00:20:37.840
where there's some book
you just can't put down.

00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:40.850
That's our ideal Daydream app.

00:20:40.850 --> 00:20:42.740
And this is a side
thing I was thinking

00:20:42.740 --> 00:20:44.800
about when I was rehearsing.

00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:47.450
The fact that a book
made out of paper

00:20:47.450 --> 00:20:49.980
can do that your
brain and can actually

00:20:49.980 --> 00:20:52.760
get you to imagine
things and picture them

00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:55.450
in your mind as
clear as if you're

00:20:55.450 --> 00:20:57.740
looking at them-- the
fact that a book on paper

00:20:57.740 --> 00:21:01.030
can do that is
absolutely ridiculous.

00:21:01.030 --> 00:21:03.070
It's absolutely amazing, right?

00:21:03.070 --> 00:21:06.140
So if you combine that with
a medium that literally

00:21:06.140 --> 00:21:09.930
is meant to make you immersed,
and to actually visualize

00:21:09.930 --> 00:21:11.450
all these things--
if you combine

00:21:11.450 --> 00:21:17.997
that kind of powerful
narrative with VR as a medium,

00:21:17.997 --> 00:21:19.830
it's absolutely amazing
what can be created,

00:21:19.830 --> 00:21:22.680
and that's what keeps us really
excited about the potential

00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:24.960
of this space.

00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:28.770
So with that in
mind, we have a bunch

00:21:28.770 --> 00:21:31.410
of talks today and
tomorrow that are

00:21:31.410 --> 00:21:33.590
going to try to show you
how to build for Daydream.

00:21:33.590 --> 00:21:36.930
In fact, we've learned
there was the prototyping

00:21:36.930 --> 00:21:39.400
talk this morning,
Daydream controller talk

00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:42.960
next, there is tomorrow's
Designing for Daydream,

00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:45.340
there is the high performance
app development tomorrow

00:21:45.340 --> 00:21:46.200
as well.

00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:47.866
So all those talks
are going to tell you

00:21:47.866 --> 00:21:51.020
how to build a Daydream app, or
at least some insights into it.

00:21:51.020 --> 00:21:53.090
I'm going to talk about
the boring part, which

00:21:53.090 --> 00:21:56.630
is how do you get your app to
be technically a Daydream app.

00:21:56.630 --> 00:21:59.100
Like how do we change
the manifest to actually

00:21:59.100 --> 00:22:00.980
make it a Daydream app.

00:22:00.980 --> 00:22:02.805
So this is a manifest.

00:22:02.805 --> 00:22:05.420
A truncated, Android
app manifest.

00:22:05.420 --> 00:22:07.135
And it's for a Daydream app.

00:22:07.135 --> 00:22:08.510
Now, what I'm
going to do is, I'm

00:22:08.510 --> 00:22:10.730
going to walk through
a few of these things

00:22:10.730 --> 00:22:13.870
and highlight some
bits and pieces.

00:22:13.870 --> 00:22:16.880
These two feature
tags tell Android

00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:20.320
that you're using both
the software and hardware

00:22:20.320 --> 00:22:21.528
features of Daydream.

00:22:24.860 --> 00:22:28.930
This particular thing, this
tag in your activity block

00:22:28.930 --> 00:22:33.610
tells the system that you want
to launch directly into VR,

00:22:33.610 --> 00:22:35.680
because you don't want
any sort of race condition

00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:38.320
or any kind of
transition from 2D to VR.

00:22:38.320 --> 00:22:41.430
And so because of that, you
put this in your activity block

00:22:41.430 --> 00:22:44.890
to tell Android that I
am an entirely VR app.

00:22:44.890 --> 00:22:50.850
I'm only useful in VR, so
trigger me into VR directly.

00:22:50.850 --> 00:22:54.480
This is how you specify the two
icon assets I've showed you.

00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:56.850
Alex is going to show you a
nice visualization of them,

00:22:56.850 --> 00:22:59.610
but basically, in the manifest,
you set these two icons

00:22:59.610 --> 00:23:03.880
and you upload the
360 degree image.

00:23:03.880 --> 00:23:06.870
Now I'm going to introduce this
concept of a self-contained VR

00:23:06.870 --> 00:23:08.230
environment.

00:23:08.230 --> 00:23:10.460
And we couldn't come
up with a shorter name.

00:23:10.460 --> 00:23:13.120
If you have ideas, let me
know, but basically, it's

00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:15.780
something where you can
navigate the entire experience

00:23:15.780 --> 00:23:19.190
without running into 2D flows.

00:23:19.190 --> 00:23:23.327
If there are 2D flows, you want
them to be graciously handled,

00:23:23.327 --> 00:23:25.160
meaning that the user
is told that they need

00:23:25.160 --> 00:23:27.560
to take their phone
off for some reason,

00:23:27.560 --> 00:23:29.570
and it needs to be
an exceptional thing.

00:23:29.570 --> 00:23:34.400
It can be a regular
part of use of the app.

00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:37.290
And so the key here, this
is the manifest entry

00:23:37.290 --> 00:23:39.520
to tell us what that intent is.

00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:42.290
This is the Daydream intent,
and it's a new intent filter

00:23:42.290 --> 00:23:45.170
category.

00:23:45.170 --> 00:23:47.930
So with that, you
have a Daydream app.

00:23:47.930 --> 00:23:50.420
You have an app that's
built from the ground up

00:23:50.420 --> 00:23:52.290
to be for Daydream.

00:23:52.290 --> 00:23:55.470
It's immersive, it's long
form, it's interactive,

00:23:55.470 --> 00:23:57.670
it takes advantage of
the hardware and software

00:23:57.670 --> 00:23:59.040
features of the platform.

00:23:59.040 --> 00:23:59.770
It is awesome.

00:23:59.770 --> 00:24:03.870
It's that beautiful book
that we talked about.

00:24:03.870 --> 00:24:05.690
But there is more, right?

00:24:05.690 --> 00:24:08.600
After all, this is Android.

00:24:08.600 --> 00:24:12.940
And Android yesterday announced
that they've had 65 billion

00:24:12.940 --> 00:24:16.950
downloads in 12 months, which
is ridiculous if you think of it

00:24:16.950 --> 00:24:18.680
in the context of
the $0.10 promo,

00:24:18.680 --> 00:24:22.370
where we had all time 10 billion
at a time and were super happy.

00:24:22.370 --> 00:24:26.110
This is 65 billion in 12 months.

00:24:26.110 --> 00:24:29.290
And we know that many of
you have users on Android.

00:24:29.290 --> 00:24:31.920
You have millions, tens of
millions, hundreds of millions

00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:35.520
of users already using
your apps on Android.

00:24:35.520 --> 00:24:38.120
So its important for us
to allow you to introduce

00:24:38.120 --> 00:24:42.020
Daydream experiences
to your existing apps.

00:24:42.020 --> 00:24:44.690
And so we have a
concept of a hybrid app,

00:24:44.690 --> 00:24:46.020
and its going to show up.

00:24:46.020 --> 00:24:50.660
A hybrid app is an app that has
both 2D flows and a Daydream

00:24:50.660 --> 00:24:52.410
experience.

00:24:52.410 --> 00:24:55.330
Now, the Daydream
experience comes to life

00:24:55.330 --> 00:24:57.630
on a Daydream-ready device.

00:24:57.630 --> 00:25:02.262
The 2D flows are
available on every device.

00:25:02.262 --> 00:25:03.720
The Play Movie's
team, for example,

00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:06.980
when they considered building
a Daydream experience,

00:25:06.980 --> 00:25:10.260
they have decided to add it to
their existing Play Movies app.

00:25:13.110 --> 00:25:14.750
This does some
really awesome stuff.

00:25:14.750 --> 00:25:18.120
Because what this does is it
aligns your development costs,

00:25:18.120 --> 00:25:22.280
and it aligns your
user acquisition costs,

00:25:22.280 --> 00:25:24.470
and finally, it
allows you to take

00:25:24.470 --> 00:25:26.230
advantage of this
large user base

00:25:26.230 --> 00:25:28.980
you already have on Android.

00:25:28.980 --> 00:25:30.300
So this is super critical.

00:25:30.300 --> 00:25:33.220
And the way you do it
is incredibly easy.

00:25:33.220 --> 00:25:36.560
You just turn that flag--
the Android Required False--

00:25:36.560 --> 00:25:39.390
you turn it from true to false.

00:25:39.390 --> 00:25:42.330
And that tells the system
that this app takes advantage

00:25:42.330 --> 00:25:44.370
of Daydream when available.

00:25:44.370 --> 00:25:48.540
But if not it, can
operate as a 2D app.

00:25:48.540 --> 00:25:50.020
So with that, you
now kind of have

00:25:50.020 --> 00:25:52.790
an idea of what are you
building-- an app that's

00:25:52.790 --> 00:25:55.540
meant entirely to be a
Daydream app from the ground

00:25:55.540 --> 00:25:58.510
up, which we think is going to
be the vast majority of stuff,

00:25:58.510 --> 00:26:01.100
or are you going to introduce
a Daydream experience

00:26:01.100 --> 00:26:02.307
to your existing app?

00:26:02.307 --> 00:26:03.140
And so you're ready.

00:26:03.140 --> 00:26:06.367
With these choices, you're ready
to submit your app for review.

00:26:06.367 --> 00:26:08.700
And so I'm going to invite
Alex, who is going to tell us

00:26:08.700 --> 00:26:11.512
about what happens after that.

00:26:11.512 --> 00:26:12.720
ALEX RUSSELL: Thanks, Brahim.

00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:13.984
BRAHIM ELBOUCHIKHI: Thank you.

00:26:13.984 --> 00:26:16.300
[APPLAUSE]

00:26:16.300 --> 00:26:21.530
ALEX RUSSELL: All right, so
you've declared the intent.

00:26:21.530 --> 00:26:25.619
You want to be in the
Home Launcher environment.

00:26:25.619 --> 00:26:27.660
So, as Brahim was saying,
you declare the intent.

00:26:27.660 --> 00:26:29.659
And when you do this,
this will trigger a review

00:26:29.659 --> 00:26:31.860
to make sure that it's
actually a VR app.

00:26:31.860 --> 00:26:33.749
This is similar to
Android Wear, where

00:26:33.749 --> 00:26:35.540
they check to make sure
things are actually

00:26:35.540 --> 00:26:38.120
watch apps, or Android
TV, where they're

00:26:38.120 --> 00:26:40.100
looking for actual TV apps.

00:26:40.100 --> 00:26:45.100
So because we care
about you understanding

00:26:45.100 --> 00:26:47.366
exactly what that
review involves,

00:26:47.366 --> 00:26:48.490
I'll tell you specifically.

00:26:48.490 --> 00:26:51.607
There's 13 criteria
that we're looking for.

00:26:51.607 --> 00:26:53.190
And if we add
additional things, we'll

00:26:53.190 --> 00:26:55.340
be communicating
that out as well.

00:26:55.340 --> 00:26:57.494
Obviously, we care a
lot about transparency.

00:26:57.494 --> 00:26:59.160
We want everyone to
know what's going on

00:26:59.160 --> 00:27:00.159
with the review process.

00:27:00.159 --> 00:27:03.020
And it's all pretty
straightforward stuff.

00:27:03.020 --> 00:27:05.480
So let's start off
with the basics.

00:27:05.480 --> 00:27:08.140
And with basics, we just
have one through four.

00:27:08.140 --> 00:27:09.390
This one doesn't really count.

00:27:09.390 --> 00:27:10.849
This is more this
kind of baseline.

00:27:10.849 --> 00:27:12.598
Your app needs to
actually install and run

00:27:12.598 --> 00:27:13.933
so that the reviewer can use it.

00:27:13.933 --> 00:27:17.230
Although, surprisingly,
sometimes that's not the case.

00:27:17.230 --> 00:27:20.510
Assuming that works out, moving
on to the actual review--

00:27:20.510 --> 00:27:21.210
performance.

00:27:21.210 --> 00:27:22.990
So does the app
maintain 60 frames

00:27:22.990 --> 00:27:25.170
per second over
long play sessions

00:27:25.170 --> 00:27:27.020
on a Daydream-ready phone?

00:27:27.020 --> 00:27:29.479
We'll be following up with more
details about exactly which

00:27:29.479 --> 00:27:32.144
phone models we'll be testing on
and how you can replicate these

00:27:32.144 --> 00:27:33.024
tests on your side.

00:27:33.024 --> 00:27:34.440
So there shouldn't
be any question

00:27:34.440 --> 00:27:37.362
about if the test
was run correctly.

00:27:37.362 --> 00:27:38.570
But this is really important.

00:27:38.570 --> 00:27:40.310
It's important
for users enjoying

00:27:40.310 --> 00:27:43.240
VR and the success of
the overall platform

00:27:43.240 --> 00:27:46.065
and the quality of experience we
want to have in the ecosystem.

00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:52.010
Number two, as Brahim was
saying, never go to 2D.

00:27:52.010 --> 00:27:53.210
This is kind of a tautology.

00:27:53.210 --> 00:27:55.510
It's like a VR app stays in VR.

00:27:55.510 --> 00:27:57.830
But it's really important
not to accidentally throw up

00:27:57.830 --> 00:28:00.900
a dialog box or something
in 2D when the user has

00:28:00.900 --> 00:28:02.150
their phone in their headset.

00:28:02.150 --> 00:28:03.760
It's a really bad experience.

00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:06.580
In particular, if you ask for
particular permissions, things

00:28:06.580 --> 00:28:09.070
like camera or contacts,
those will actually

00:28:09.070 --> 00:28:13.180
currently trigger a 2D dialog
box in VR, which is not good.

00:28:13.180 --> 00:28:16.051
So we'll be looking
for things like that.

00:28:16.051 --> 00:28:18.050
And if you do need to ask
for those permissions,

00:28:18.050 --> 00:28:20.740
just doing it in a 2D
flow before the user gets

00:28:20.740 --> 00:28:21.794
to being in VR.

00:28:21.794 --> 00:28:23.210
And you'll know
when you're in VR,

00:28:23.210 --> 00:28:25.043
so then you know not
to call the permission.

00:28:25.043 --> 00:28:27.761
Number three-- this one's
pretty direct-- App stays

00:28:27.761 --> 00:28:28.510
in landscape mode.

00:28:28.510 --> 00:28:30.676
Obviously, if the user moves
their head to the side,

00:28:30.676 --> 00:28:33.370
you don't want the
phone reoriented.

00:28:33.370 --> 00:28:36.190
Number four, also, you'd
think it's very direct,

00:28:36.190 --> 00:28:39.090
but a lot of apps are
currently doing this wrong.

00:28:39.090 --> 00:28:40.960
Use immersive fullscreen mode.

00:28:40.960 --> 00:28:43.750
You don't want to have the
status bar and system bar

00:28:43.750 --> 00:28:46.470
on screen when the users in VR.

00:28:46.470 --> 00:28:48.779
Some people will accidentally
go into lights-out mode,

00:28:48.779 --> 00:28:49.570
where it dims them.

00:28:49.570 --> 00:28:51.770
You can still kind of see them
in your peripheral vision,

00:28:51.770 --> 00:28:53.978
and depending on the lenses,
you might really see it.

00:28:53.978 --> 00:28:57.010
So you want to use, obviously,
the entire screen to show

00:28:57.010 --> 00:28:59.790
your VR content.

00:28:59.790 --> 00:29:02.080
So that gets us through
the super basic stuff.

00:29:02.080 --> 00:29:05.130
Moving on to comfort--
items 5 through 10.

00:29:05.130 --> 00:29:07.680
Number five, users
can focus on elements.

00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:11.430
So in VR, you're showing stuff
stereoscopically with lenses.

00:29:11.430 --> 00:29:14.360
If you bring objects
in less than a meter,

00:29:14.360 --> 00:29:16.100
but especially like
getting in that kind

00:29:16.100 --> 00:29:18.130
of 10-centimeter
range, a lot of users

00:29:18.130 --> 00:29:20.310
aren't going be able to
focus on them, especially

00:29:20.310 --> 00:29:22.800
if this is like a critical
piece of interface

00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:25.250
or your menu or
something like that.

00:29:25.250 --> 00:29:28.370
If the reviewer sees
that they're actually

00:29:28.370 --> 00:29:31.580
having to go somewhat cross-eyed
and they can't actually

00:29:31.580 --> 00:29:35.289
focus on objects, that could
trigger this being an issue.

00:29:35.289 --> 00:29:37.330
So, as a general rule,
for really critical stuff,

00:29:37.330 --> 00:29:38.970
you want to keep
it more than half

00:29:38.970 --> 00:29:40.349
a meter away from the user.

00:29:40.349 --> 00:29:41.890
And in your own
testing, you're going

00:29:41.890 --> 00:29:44.070
to realize this
because you'll have

00:29:44.070 --> 00:29:46.980
trouble using your own app.

00:29:46.980 --> 00:29:49.670
Number six, app
maintains head tracking.

00:29:49.670 --> 00:29:51.680
So similar to
performance, you really

00:29:51.680 --> 00:29:54.309
never want to freeze
the camera in VR.

00:29:54.309 --> 00:29:55.850
As a user's moving
their head around,

00:29:55.850 --> 00:29:57.890
you have to always update.

00:29:57.890 --> 00:30:00.759
But something that we
found is a lot of apps,

00:30:00.759 --> 00:30:02.050
they'll have great performance.

00:30:02.050 --> 00:30:04.400
But then when they're
loading a new scene,

00:30:04.400 --> 00:30:06.380
the app will freeze
for maybe half a second

00:30:06.380 --> 00:30:08.749
or a second as that
new scene loads in.

00:30:08.749 --> 00:30:10.790
And it's not because the
app had bad performance.

00:30:10.790 --> 00:30:12.882
It's just they
actually were done.

00:30:12.882 --> 00:30:14.340
Now they had to
load the new scene,

00:30:14.340 --> 00:30:15.756
so they didn't
have an opportunity

00:30:15.756 --> 00:30:17.160
to maintain head tracking.

00:30:17.160 --> 00:30:20.660
So those things can still make
people really not feel good,

00:30:20.660 --> 00:30:23.950
like even just a second here
and there can be a problem.

00:30:23.950 --> 00:30:26.582
So if you're going to
have to load a new scene

00:30:26.582 --> 00:30:28.290
and you're not doing
asynchronous loading

00:30:28.290 --> 00:30:32.075
or something, just fade to black
or fade to any solid color,

00:30:32.075 --> 00:30:34.700
so the user doesn't have objects
onscreen that they can realize

00:30:34.700 --> 00:30:35.908
the head tracking turned off.

00:30:37.955 --> 00:30:39.580
If you actually want
to play with this,

00:30:39.580 --> 00:30:41.621
in the Cardboard design
lab, we have a demo where

00:30:41.621 --> 00:30:44.440
tracking turns off randomly.

00:30:44.440 --> 00:30:49.080
It doesn't feel great, if
you want to experience it.

00:30:49.080 --> 00:30:51.590
Also on the topic of not
feeling great, stable horizon

00:30:51.590 --> 00:30:53.875
line-- if the app has
a visible horizon,

00:30:53.875 --> 00:30:56.670
it needs to remain stable.

00:30:56.670 --> 00:31:00.830
A quick example of
this-- I apologize.

00:31:00.830 --> 00:31:02.830
Let's keep it on screen
for a little bit longer.

00:31:02.830 --> 00:31:04.830
And then you don't want
to drop frames like that

00:31:04.830 --> 00:31:07.660
either-- also not good.

00:31:07.660 --> 00:31:11.160
Yes, so this is a big thing
for user comfort as well.

00:31:11.160 --> 00:31:13.640
Then number eight, users
initiate movement--

00:31:13.640 --> 00:31:17.500
so if users are
moving around a scene,

00:31:17.500 --> 00:31:21.280
you want them to actually
point and click to teleport,

00:31:21.280 --> 00:31:25.910
or use the trackpad on the
controller to walk forward.

00:31:25.910 --> 00:31:28.360
Even if it's a roller
coaster or the entire point

00:31:28.360 --> 00:31:30.693
as they're getting in this
car and then the car is going

00:31:30.693 --> 00:31:32.520
to take them around,
they should click

00:31:32.520 --> 00:31:33.916
to start the roller coaster.

00:31:33.916 --> 00:31:35.290
So at no point
should you just be

00:31:35.290 --> 00:31:36.820
kind of randomly
grabbing the user

00:31:36.820 --> 00:31:38.820
and flinging them
around to various parts

00:31:38.820 --> 00:31:41.920
of your application without
them indicating that's actually

00:31:41.920 --> 00:31:43.010
what they wanted.

00:31:43.010 --> 00:31:44.990
They shouldn't be
surprised by that,

00:31:44.990 --> 00:31:47.890
because it's part of the
surprise that actually affects

00:31:47.890 --> 00:31:48.940
your level of comfort.

00:31:48.940 --> 00:31:51.220
It's sort of similar to driving
a car, you don't get car sick.

00:31:51.220 --> 00:31:52.900
But when you're a
passenger in a car, you do.

00:31:52.900 --> 00:31:54.858
Because when you're
driving, you can anticipate

00:31:54.858 --> 00:31:57.550
how the car's going to feel.

00:31:57.550 --> 00:31:59.884
Another other example
of teleportation,

00:31:59.884 --> 00:32:02.050
or any of these other
different types of locomotion,

00:32:02.050 --> 00:32:04.310
we have that in last
year's Cardboard design lab

00:32:04.310 --> 00:32:08.030
as well, where the user's
clicking to move about.

00:32:08.030 --> 00:32:11.980
Number nine, honestly
represent content in the app.

00:32:11.980 --> 00:32:14.470
Descriptions and
screenshots should

00:32:14.470 --> 00:32:17.570
be generally representative
of what your app's about.

00:32:17.570 --> 00:32:20.980
So imagine you have this
great meditation app,

00:32:20.980 --> 00:32:22.820
and it's about hanging
out on the beach.

00:32:22.820 --> 00:32:26.270
and the user's very relaxed,
and the palm trees are swaying.

00:32:26.270 --> 00:32:29.930
And then 15 minutes
in or so, a zombie

00:32:29.930 --> 00:32:33.030
shows up wielding a chainsaw.

00:32:33.030 --> 00:32:34.160
That's fine.

00:32:34.160 --> 00:32:37.340
But you should somehow indicate
in the description or title

00:32:37.340 --> 00:32:39.510
or screenshots that that
was going to happen.

00:32:39.510 --> 00:32:42.484
We don't want just
blatant surprises and kind

00:32:42.484 --> 00:32:43.400
of trolling like that.

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:47.560
So that covers comfort.

00:32:47.560 --> 00:32:53.520
Now on to Daydream integration
for the final three.

00:32:53.520 --> 00:32:56.600
Number 10, app uses the
Daydream controller.

00:32:56.600 --> 00:32:59.634
So the Daydream controller
comes with every single viewer.

00:32:59.634 --> 00:33:01.300
Also, the Daydream
controller's required

00:33:01.300 --> 00:33:02.258
to use the home screen.

00:33:02.258 --> 00:33:03.860
So when the user
launches your app,

00:33:03.860 --> 00:33:07.160
we know that they're holding
that controller in their hand.

00:33:07.160 --> 00:33:08.680
We want all of the
apps on Daydream

00:33:08.680 --> 00:33:11.410
to take advantage
of the controller.

00:33:11.410 --> 00:33:13.470
In particular, if
you're bringing an app

00:33:13.470 --> 00:33:17.510
over from Cardboard, just using
the controller as a clicker

00:33:17.510 --> 00:33:21.300
doesn't actually count as taking
advantage of the controller.

00:33:21.300 --> 00:33:22.980
We want the
controller to be used

00:33:22.980 --> 00:33:24.859
for targeting input and
not the user's head,

00:33:24.859 --> 00:33:27.150
since we now have an additional
[INAUDIBLE] controller.

00:33:30.350 --> 00:33:32.784
Number 11, app has a VR icon.

00:33:32.784 --> 00:33:34.200
So users are going
to be launching

00:33:34.200 --> 00:33:36.040
your app from inside
of VR, so obviously you

00:33:36.040 --> 00:33:38.050
need to provide this.

00:33:38.050 --> 00:33:39.320
There's two aspects.

00:33:39.320 --> 00:33:41.580
There's a background element
and a foreground element.

00:33:41.580 --> 00:33:43.330
The reviewers are just
going to be looking

00:33:43.330 --> 00:33:45.413
for little simple things,
like you actually filled

00:33:45.413 --> 00:33:47.010
out the full texture.

00:33:47.010 --> 00:33:49.300
So if you only paint
the front, and the sides

00:33:49.300 --> 00:33:51.770
and back are white, that
might trigger something.

00:33:51.770 --> 00:33:54.230
Also, it kind of sort
of shimmers in VR

00:33:54.230 --> 00:33:56.860
if you didn't paint
the whole thing,

00:33:56.860 --> 00:33:58.060
but pretty straightforward.

00:33:58.060 --> 00:34:01.500
And we'll publish all
the specs for this.

00:34:01.500 --> 00:34:04.562
And then you have a
360-photosphere screenshot.

00:34:04.562 --> 00:34:06.520
We'll be using these in
a few different places.

00:34:06.520 --> 00:34:11.618
One is in Play VR-- Play Store
VR-- as the user looks around.

00:34:11.618 --> 00:34:13.909
As they're browsing apps,
this will be the environments

00:34:13.909 --> 00:34:15.719
that your app is in.

00:34:15.719 --> 00:34:17.469
And then, also, in
2D, we may use these

00:34:17.469 --> 00:34:20.010
as like a Magic Window, where
you can kind of move your phone

00:34:20.010 --> 00:34:21.100
around and see the app.

00:34:24.250 --> 00:34:27.130
And then generating
a 360 environment

00:34:27.130 --> 00:34:28.707
is actually really simple.

00:34:28.707 --> 00:34:30.290
Depending on what
game engine you use,

00:34:30.290 --> 00:34:31.739
you find the correct plugin.

00:34:31.739 --> 00:34:33.155
In this case, it's
showing Unity--

00:34:33.155 --> 00:34:34.909
so bringing in a
plugin, where you

00:34:34.909 --> 00:34:36.770
can do a capture of panorama.

00:34:36.770 --> 00:34:39.370
You're just attaching that
script onto a game object.

00:34:39.370 --> 00:34:40.440
Then you launch the game.

00:34:40.440 --> 00:34:42.439
In this case, you just
hit a key on the keyboard

00:34:42.439 --> 00:34:45.310
and it generates the
photosphere for you.

00:34:45.310 --> 00:34:47.460
So you can sort of stage
your shots that way.

00:34:47.460 --> 00:34:51.270
And these plugins are available
across all the game engines,

00:34:51.270 --> 00:34:53.929
and we'll be posting
links to them as well.

00:34:53.929 --> 00:34:56.449
So that's how you get
listed in Play VR.

00:34:56.449 --> 00:34:59.330
But that leaves sort of the
broader and more interesting

00:34:59.330 --> 00:35:01.990
question of what should
you actually make?

00:35:01.990 --> 00:35:03.630
To which, to some
extent, our answer

00:35:03.630 --> 00:35:06.190
is like, well, it's
up to you guys.

00:35:06.190 --> 00:35:10.030
You can be imaginative,
and that's what's exciting.

00:35:10.030 --> 00:35:13.350
But there are a few things that
we're really excited about,

00:35:13.350 --> 00:35:16.700
so we wanted to sort
of share some of that.

00:35:16.700 --> 00:35:21.230
This isn't based on
really firm data yet,

00:35:21.230 --> 00:35:22.860
because it's so early for VR.

00:35:22.860 --> 00:35:25.346
A lot of this is kind of a
mixture of our experiences

00:35:25.346 --> 00:35:27.220
and intuition and
observing other things that

00:35:27.220 --> 00:35:29.330
are happening with apps.

00:35:29.330 --> 00:35:31.910
So this is going to
evolve a little bit.

00:35:31.910 --> 00:35:35.730
It's a little bit mushier
than, say, the 13 criteria.

00:35:35.730 --> 00:35:38.730
But the first thing that
we're thinking about

00:35:38.730 --> 00:35:42.390
is overall, what
experience do you want

00:35:42.390 --> 00:35:44.650
users to have with your app?

00:35:44.650 --> 00:35:46.620
We're finding this
is like an early way

00:35:46.620 --> 00:35:48.400
that apps seem to be
bucketing themselves

00:35:48.400 --> 00:35:50.070
into different categories in VR.

00:35:50.070 --> 00:35:51.620
Do you want the
app to be relaxing,

00:35:51.620 --> 00:35:53.280
or do you want it
to be thrilling?

00:35:53.280 --> 00:35:55.259
And it's not the
case that one of them

00:35:55.259 --> 00:35:56.800
is necessarily better
than the other.

00:35:56.800 --> 00:35:58.790
They're just very different.

00:35:58.790 --> 00:36:01.050
So roller coaster
apps are actually

00:36:01.050 --> 00:36:04.275
very popular on Google Play
right now for Cardboard.

00:36:04.275 --> 00:36:06.400
But just like how roller
coasters in the real world

00:36:06.400 --> 00:36:08.234
aren't for everyone,
virtual roller coasters

00:36:08.234 --> 00:36:09.066
aren't for everyone.

00:36:09.066 --> 00:36:10.820
They have their market,
and other people

00:36:10.820 --> 00:36:13.150
aren't super interested
in roller coasters.

00:36:13.150 --> 00:36:15.260
So something we've
been thinking about

00:36:15.260 --> 00:36:17.870
is trying to have a
little bit more structure

00:36:17.870 --> 00:36:22.540
to this notion of what the
physiological experience

00:36:22.540 --> 00:36:24.010
of the app is.

00:36:24.010 --> 00:36:26.940
So we're referring to
this is motion intensity.

00:36:26.940 --> 00:36:31.270
And currently we're bucketing
into three categories.

00:36:31.270 --> 00:36:33.000
This might evolve
a bit over time.

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:35.210
We think that three is
probably useful to think about

00:36:35.210 --> 00:36:36.810
as you're thinking
about the motion

00:36:36.810 --> 00:36:39.210
intensity of your
application-- so no motion,

00:36:39.210 --> 00:36:42.120
moderate, and intense.

00:36:42.120 --> 00:36:45.370
And to help me explain
this, I actually

00:36:45.370 --> 00:36:49.580
have a prop, because
sometimes this is complicated.

00:36:49.580 --> 00:36:53.390
So here, this is the user.

00:36:53.390 --> 00:36:56.720
It is also the camera
in your game engine,

00:36:56.720 --> 00:36:58.610
and it's really
important to-- honestly,

00:36:58.610 --> 00:37:00.276
I think the game
engines should actually

00:37:00.276 --> 00:37:02.665
make them look like heads,
so that people remember

00:37:02.665 --> 00:37:04.456
that this is the user
in their game engine,

00:37:04.456 --> 00:37:05.850
and not just a camera.

00:37:05.850 --> 00:37:08.920
Or as our filmmaker
Jessica likes to say,

00:37:08.920 --> 00:37:11.630
the cameras are
made out of people.

00:37:11.630 --> 00:37:13.830
So these can consciously
choose to look around

00:37:13.830 --> 00:37:15.330
in any action they want.

00:37:15.330 --> 00:37:17.270
But then, as a
developer, you can also

00:37:17.270 --> 00:37:18.790
choose to move these around.

00:37:18.790 --> 00:37:19.949
So, Brahim, heads up.

00:37:19.949 --> 00:37:21.490
BRAHIM ELBOUCHIKHI:
You want it back?

00:37:21.490 --> 00:37:23.990
ALEX RUSSELL: Yeah, sure.

00:37:23.990 --> 00:37:25.310
Toss that out there.

00:37:25.310 --> 00:37:27.720
Yeah, so, as a developer,
you want to be careful.

00:37:27.720 --> 00:37:28.220
That's OK.

00:37:28.220 --> 00:37:29.620
I've got another one.

00:37:29.620 --> 00:37:31.740
The podium is actually
full of heads right now.

00:37:31.740 --> 00:37:33.370
It's very weird.

00:37:33.370 --> 00:37:35.420
So thinking about
motion intensity,

00:37:35.420 --> 00:37:38.290
no motion is just the user
is moving their head around.

00:37:38.290 --> 00:37:40.490
The developer's
not doing anything.

00:37:40.490 --> 00:37:44.330
So things like watching
a movie, those types

00:37:44.330 --> 00:37:45.750
of apps where you're still.

00:37:48.640 --> 00:37:51.205
In terms of moderate
motion, the user

00:37:51.205 --> 00:37:53.466
is moving in two
degrees virtually.

00:37:53.466 --> 00:37:55.090
So they can move
their head themselves,

00:37:55.090 --> 00:37:57.664
but say they're in
a car or they've

00:37:57.664 --> 00:37:59.330
indicated they want
to walk, they're not

00:37:59.330 --> 00:38:00.205
walking in real life.

00:38:00.205 --> 00:38:02.190
But they're using the
controller to walk.

00:38:02.190 --> 00:38:05.830
So virtually just kind of
traveling in one plane, that's

00:38:05.830 --> 00:38:07.010
moderate.

00:38:07.010 --> 00:38:09.000
Limited acceleration
and deceleration--

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:10.920
If you accelerate
really, really fast, that

00:38:10.920 --> 00:38:12.230
would make it more intense.

00:38:12.230 --> 00:38:14.656
Also, if there's a lot of
objects coming at them,

00:38:14.656 --> 00:38:16.030
that could make
it more intense--

00:38:16.030 --> 00:38:17.530
the combination of
the things coming

00:38:17.530 --> 00:38:18.880
at you with you moving forward.

00:38:18.880 --> 00:38:22.390
And then final category
for intense, this

00:38:22.390 --> 00:38:25.410
is where you get into the
virtual flying and driving

00:38:25.410 --> 00:38:27.130
and roller coasters
and spaceships

00:38:27.130 --> 00:38:29.360
and that kind of stuff,
where in addition to the user

00:38:29.360 --> 00:38:32.760
moving their head around, the
developer is also putting them

00:38:32.760 --> 00:38:34.690
in a space ship,
where it is causing

00:38:34.690 --> 00:38:39.510
three to six degrees of motion.

00:38:39.510 --> 00:38:42.226
So we're still sort of figuring
out the details on this.

00:38:42.226 --> 00:38:45.180
I don't actually need
the head anymore.

00:38:45.180 --> 00:38:48.435
One way to think
about it is it's

00:38:48.435 --> 00:38:50.700
the difference between
sitting, walking, and flying.

00:38:50.700 --> 00:38:52.575
It's a little bit more
complicated than that.

00:38:52.575 --> 00:38:55.322
Things like if there's
no floor present,

00:38:55.322 --> 00:38:56.780
even if the user's
not moving, that

00:38:56.780 --> 00:38:58.840
could be slightly disorienting.

00:38:58.840 --> 00:39:00.300
So not having a
floor could cause

00:39:00.300 --> 00:39:03.360
it to go between no
motion to moderate.

00:39:03.360 --> 00:39:06.290
Or even if they're still and
there's very large objects

00:39:06.290 --> 00:39:08.140
coming at them, that
can give the perception

00:39:08.140 --> 00:39:09.920
that you're moving forward,
because you sort of lose

00:39:09.920 --> 00:39:10.880
your grounding.

00:39:10.880 --> 00:39:13.400
So that could also cause it
to go from no to moderate.

00:39:13.400 --> 00:39:16.650
So we'll be publishing
more details about this

00:39:16.650 --> 00:39:20.660
as we think more about how apps
would fall into these buckets.

00:39:20.660 --> 00:39:23.900
We think it's important to have
the sort of physiological way

00:39:23.900 --> 00:39:25.401
for users to think
about categories,

00:39:25.401 --> 00:39:27.941
because some people are really
interested in some categories,

00:39:27.941 --> 00:39:29.870
and other people are
interested in others.

00:39:29.870 --> 00:39:33.840
So that's one way of thinking
about how to group apps.

00:39:33.840 --> 00:39:36.140
But what about the genres?

00:39:36.140 --> 00:39:38.420
What are the different
types of VR apps,

00:39:38.420 --> 00:39:40.260
more in terms of content?

00:39:40.260 --> 00:39:41.890
And that's sort of interesting.

00:39:41.890 --> 00:39:47.520
It's like the genres are still
largely being discovered in VR.

00:39:47.520 --> 00:39:49.620
We seem to see a few things.

00:39:49.620 --> 00:39:51.740
In particular, games
and entertainment

00:39:51.740 --> 00:39:53.150
seems to be really big.

00:39:53.150 --> 00:39:56.750
But something we're
finding is this

00:39:56.750 --> 00:39:58.480
is a general-purpose
computing platform.

00:39:58.480 --> 00:40:00.250
This is Android.

00:40:00.250 --> 00:40:02.000
So games and
entertainment are great.

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:03.710
But also VR can
be about much more

00:40:03.710 --> 00:40:05.020
than games and entertainment.

00:40:05.020 --> 00:40:07.370
And we're in the
very, very early days

00:40:07.370 --> 00:40:10.910
of starting to see that emerge.

00:40:10.910 --> 00:40:13.610
So here's some quick
ideas of things

00:40:13.610 --> 00:40:16.200
that we're excited about.

00:40:16.200 --> 00:40:18.050
Education is really interesting.

00:40:18.050 --> 00:40:21.280
Google's done a lot of work with
expeditions and primary school.

00:40:21.280 --> 00:40:25.230
But even education for higher
education is super interesting.

00:40:25.230 --> 00:40:26.840
Learning physics in
VR could be great.

00:40:26.840 --> 00:40:30.060
Learning organic chemistry in
VR could be really interesting.

00:40:30.060 --> 00:40:32.170
Being able to engage the
user's spatial memory

00:40:32.170 --> 00:40:35.640
could actually have impact
on their ability to learn,

00:40:35.640 --> 00:40:38.450
and there might be some
real advantages to having

00:40:38.450 --> 00:40:41.720
a 3D environment for education.

00:40:41.720 --> 00:40:44.300
Architecture is something
that often comes up

00:40:44.300 --> 00:40:46.030
and we're very excited
about-- not just

00:40:46.030 --> 00:40:47.613
in the professional
use case, but also

00:40:47.613 --> 00:40:51.170
users being able to model
things and play around.

00:40:51.170 --> 00:40:58.530
Music is just starting to
emerge as a category for VR.

00:40:58.530 --> 00:41:00.700
I don't know how many
people played Audio Shields.

00:41:00.700 --> 00:41:02.040
It's really neat.

00:41:02.040 --> 00:41:05.860
Also Daydream Labs has some very
cool experiments with music.

00:41:05.860 --> 00:41:08.650
A lot of these, they're still
a little bit more traditional.

00:41:08.650 --> 00:41:11.020
But imagine like
you're a DJ in VR

00:41:11.020 --> 00:41:13.560
and you're going beyond
the physical constraints

00:41:13.560 --> 00:41:15.290
of a turntable.

00:41:15.290 --> 00:41:17.710
That could be really neat.

00:41:17.710 --> 00:41:20.350
You can really play with
the concept of music.

00:41:20.350 --> 00:41:23.230
You can even have the user
dancing, like the music

00:41:23.230 --> 00:41:24.750
responding to them dance.

00:41:24.750 --> 00:41:27.010
So I think this
sort of brings us

00:41:27.010 --> 00:41:31.460
to the topic of like
going beyond reality.

00:41:31.460 --> 00:41:33.750
A lot of VR apps
right now are awfully

00:41:33.750 --> 00:41:36.390
grounded in reality,
which is weird,

00:41:36.390 --> 00:41:38.470
because you don't have to be.

00:41:38.470 --> 00:41:40.060
So there's lots
of things that you

00:41:40.060 --> 00:41:43.250
could do that just simply can't
happen in the real life-- so

00:41:43.250 --> 00:41:45.180
data visualization,
of course; being

00:41:45.180 --> 00:41:48.260
able to understand
complex data, which

00:41:48.260 --> 00:41:49.990
we haven't been
able to do before,

00:41:49.990 --> 00:41:52.990
unless you build lots
of models about it.

00:41:52.990 --> 00:41:55.520
Meditation could be
really interesting.

00:41:55.520 --> 00:41:57.960
Music visualizations,
and kind of almost

00:41:57.960 --> 00:42:01.070
synesthetic experience-- playing
with these types of things

00:42:01.070 --> 00:42:03.210
could be very neat.

00:42:03.210 --> 00:42:06.300
Also e-sports might
be really interesting.

00:42:06.300 --> 00:42:08.670
A crowd forming to
watch other people

00:42:08.670 --> 00:42:11.645
to compete at something
that goes beyond reality

00:42:11.645 --> 00:42:13.270
could be a really
compelling use of VR.

00:42:13.270 --> 00:42:15.730
So that's just some
of the initial ideas

00:42:15.730 --> 00:42:18.560
off the top of our head of what
we think we might see emerge.

00:42:18.560 --> 00:42:21.120
But what's exciting is
it seems like every day

00:42:21.120 --> 00:42:24.310
we're seeing almost entirely
new app categories come out.

00:42:24.310 --> 00:42:28.300
And there's lots of room for
exploration and innovation,

00:42:28.300 --> 00:42:31.010
and really, you have an
infinite canvas to explore.

00:42:31.010 --> 00:42:33.440
So with that, thank you.
