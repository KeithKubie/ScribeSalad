00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.090
ROGER BOWLEY: The number I want
to talk about now is the

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:04.640
square root of 2.

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:06.900
JAMES GRIME: My favorite
fact about root 2?

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:10.250
Well, if you take the
A series of paper.

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:11.840
So this is A4 paper.

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:14.130
It's pretty standard in
most of the world.

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.980
If you take a piece of paper
like this, if you look at the

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.480
ratio between the long edge
and the short edge, which

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.980
means if you measure the long
edge, and you divide by the

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:28.160
short edge, it will be
the square root of 2.

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.150
And they picked this
on purpose.

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:34.630
ROGER BOWLEY: The square
root of 2 is about 1.41

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:36.010
something or other.

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:39.420
And it's the number you get if
you work with Pythagoras'

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.100
Theorem, which said that if you
have a unit length along

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:43.940
there, and a unit length
along there.

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.020
So this length, the square of
this length plus the square of

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:47.980
that is that.

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:51.660
This length is root 2, it's
the square root of 2.

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.410
JAMES GRIME: If I fold this
piece of paper in half--

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:55.530
let's try that out.

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.820
This now is something
called A5 paper.

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:00.540
We started with A4.

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:02.810
This is now A5 paper.

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:05.420
And if you do the same thing
again, if you take the long

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:10.660
edge of this and divide by the
short edge, it will again be

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:11.990
the square root of 2.

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:13.910
The ratio is the same.

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:17.530
They do this so that you can
scale things up and scale them

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:20.960
down without it being
disproportionate.

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.640
ROGER BOWLEY: Square root of
2 is this, which is 1.41.

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.530
Well, it runs on forever.

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:30.040
It doesn't stop at a
particular point.

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:31.280
And there are a whole
range of these.

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.100
This is just the
first of many.

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:34.970
Another one is pi.

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:37.790
JAMES GRIME: In fact, they
start off with A0.

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:42.480
An A0 is defined to be a piece
of paper, which has a ratio,

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:47.040
square root of 2, and it has an
area of one meter squared.

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.380
In fact, root 2 is the only
ratio where this works.

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:51.870
And I'm going to show
that it's the

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:53.010
only ratio this works.

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.500
There you go.

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.330
Well, our rectangular
piece of paper.

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:59.030
This is your long edge, which
I'm going to call a, and this

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.320
is your short edge, which
I'm going to call b.

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:05.890
Now, if I take the long edge,
a, and divide by the short

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:08.110
edge, b, I'll get a ratio.

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:10.750
It's actually going to be root
2, but let's pretend we don't

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:12.070
know that yet.

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:13.770
But this is what I want.

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:19.790
If I cut this in half, I want
this now to be the long edge.

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:22.370
So b is now the long edge.

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:25.897
The short edge is actually
half of a, this

00:02:25.897 --> 00:02:28.360
side, half of a.

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.680
Now I want that to be the same
ratio as I had before.

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.540
In other words, I want these
two things to be equal.

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:38.380
So all we have to do now
is rearrange this,

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:39.910
play with this a little.

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:41.320
Let's see what we get.

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:42.180
OK.

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:45.700
Let's take the b's over this
side, the a's over this side.

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:50.450
If you play with it, you will
get a squared on the left, and

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:54.190
2 b squared on the
right-hand side.

00:02:54.190 --> 00:03:01.220
Or, in other words, a squared
divided by b squared equals 2.

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:05.250
Or, square root it, square
root both sides.

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:09.420
And you'll get a divided
by b on the left.

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:13.170
And on the right, you get
the square root of 2.

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:18.090
And this was actually the
ratio we wanted to find.

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:22.960
The only ratio where this works
is the square root of 2.

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:24.670
JAMES GRIME: This is Pythagoras'
Theorem.

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:28.350
Pythagoreans were a cult
way, way back.

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:30.270
And there might have been a
figure called Pythagoras

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:31.300
associated with this.

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:33.700
But they were very
strange bunch.

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:36.630
And they believed
in this theorem.

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:39.260
They believed in the harmony
of natural numbers.

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.230
So if you want to do music, you
took a bit of string of

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:43.020
certain tension.

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:45.070
If you took half the length,
you'll get a

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:46.720
harmonious note with it.

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:51.110
They thought all of nature
was composed of numbers.

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:54.250
They thought that everything
could either be expressed as a

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:56.860
pure integer or a ratio
of integers.

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:59.250
That was their fundamental
core belief.

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:00.050
JAMES GRIME: What
did they know?

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:03.310
They had the numbers one,
two, three, four, five.

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:05.760
They had worked out the
fractions, that you could

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:10.370
divide two things together, 3/5,
1/2, that sort of thing.

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:11.780
ROGER BOWLEY: They had other
beliefs, as well.

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:14.160
That you shouldn't marry a woman
who wore gold jewelry,

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:15.490
for example.

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:17.149
Or you should be a vegetarian.

00:04:17.149 --> 00:04:19.079
And you shouldn't
eat fava beans.

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:21.670
And you shouldn't urinate
towards the sun.

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:27.030
There was a disciple of this
strange sect called Hippasus.

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:31.960
And he worked out that if you
believed in this theorem,

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:37.260
Pythagoras Theorem, then you
could show mathematically a

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:41.280
proof showing that this
number is not a

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:43.370
ratio of two integers.

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:45.600
JAMES GRIME: But a number that
could not be written as a

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:49.910
fraction, that was a new thing
that went on forever.

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:51.560
That's what an irrational
number is.

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:53.670
ROGER BOWLEY: And they disliked
this so much.

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:56.180
I can't begin to tell you how
much they disliked it.

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:59.430
So they took him out to sea,
according to legend, and he

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:00.460
didn't come back.

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:02.590
Somehow, either they drowned
him or left him

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:03.730
on a deserted island.

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:05.040
He wasn't seen again.

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:06.060
JAMES GRIME: They did,
apparently--

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:08.380
they suppressed this
information.

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:11.640
They weren't sure that this
was a real thing.

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:14.060
ROGER BOWLEY: We call them now
irrational numbers because

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:17.050
they don't fit in with this
Pythagorean viewpoint.

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:18.720
JAMES GRIME: It's the same sort
of problem that people

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:19.950
have today.

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:23.715
People say to me, oh, I've heard
of complex numbers, I've

00:05:23.715 --> 00:05:24.940
heard of that.

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:26.120
I don't believe they exist.

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:27.900
I don't understand it.

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:29.840
Same problem, they do exist.

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:32.420
It's just you have to
get used to it.

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:34.400
ROGER BOWLEY: So he was one
of the first people to be

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:37.630
persecuted for proving
people wrong with

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:39.260
their previous ideas.

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:40.840
And this has gone on
through history.

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:43.490
I mean, I could tell you about
physicists who've suffered,

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:46.590
like Bruno Giordano,
who went to--

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:50.060
burnt at the stake for saying
the universe was infinite.

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:52.510
And the Catholic church said,
well, that doesn't leave any

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:53.960
room for God.

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:56.990
JAMES GRIME: We're going
to prove that root 2 is

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:57.630
irrational.

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:00.320
It cannot be written
as a fraction.

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:03.340
The way we prove this is a
really powerful, useful

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:05.780
mathematical proof called
contradiction.

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:07.760
We're going to assume
the opposite.

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:10.020
I'm going to assume you can
write it as a fraction.

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:14.190
Let's assume we can write
it as a divided by b .

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:15.910
And this a and b are special.

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:17.060
They are integers.

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:18.820
They are whole numbers.

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:20.540
They're one, two, three,
four, five.

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:22.000
They're something like that.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.030
And they're in their smallest
possible terms.

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:29.950
So we're not including things
like 2 divided by 4 because

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:31.610
that's a half.

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:33.230
That's not in its smallest
possible terms.

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:34.050
All right.

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:35.190
Let's see what we can do.

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:38.380
ROGER BOWLEY: If you come up
with an idea which is right

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:43.750
but goes against conventional
wisdom, you can be sent to a

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:47.290
desert island, or burned at
the stake, or executed.

00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:50.950
Because people don't like their
ideas about how the

00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:52.550
world should be upset.

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:55.210
Even if you can disprove it,
it's not a good idea to

00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:57.750
urinate towards the sun.

00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:00.660
JAMES GRIME: I'm going
to square both sides.

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:03.620
So on the left-hand
side, I get a 2.

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:06.350
On the right-hand side,
I get a squared

00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:08.580
divided by b squared.

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:11.590
This time, a and b are whole
numbers, remember.

00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:12.800
Let's play with it.

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:18.290
We get 2b squared on the left
equals a squared on the right.

00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:20.550
Now what I've shown here
is I've shown that

00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:22.900
a squared is even.

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:27.270
Because it's a multiple of
2, it's an even number.

00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:30.630
And you can show that because
a squared is even,

00:07:30.630 --> 00:07:32.960
a is even as well.

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:35.910
Well, if it was two odd numbers
squared, that would be

00:07:35.910 --> 00:07:36.840
an odd number.

00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:40.540
So yeah, yeah, if a squared is
even, the original number, a,

00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:41.720
that was even.

00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:44.940
So a is even.

00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:46.010
OK.

00:07:46.010 --> 00:07:47.580
So a is even.

00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:50.550
Let's call it something
else, let's call it a

00:07:50.550 --> 00:07:52.060
equals 2 times c.

00:07:55.220 --> 00:07:56.700
So what do we have now?

00:07:56.700 --> 00:08:02.247
2b squared on the left-hand side
is 2 times c because it's

00:08:02.247 --> 00:08:04.530
even, squared.

00:08:04.530 --> 00:08:08.210
This is equal to 4c squared.

00:08:08.210 --> 00:08:10.280
In other words, I'm
saying b squared

00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:12.610
is equal to 2c squared.

00:08:12.610 --> 00:08:13.840
Can you see that?

00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:15.870
b squared is even.

00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:22.700
If b squared is even, like
before, b is even.

00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:27.090
What I've shown is a is
even and b is even.

00:08:27.090 --> 00:08:28.290
That's a problem.

00:08:28.290 --> 00:08:29.760
They can't both be even.

00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:33.340
Like my example of 2 divided by
4, it's not in its smallest
