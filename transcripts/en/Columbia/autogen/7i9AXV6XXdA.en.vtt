think the first thing we have to do is
 

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:36.420
think the first thing we have to do is
ask what is a theory I think we'll most

but I think the more problematic matter
 

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:48.540

is understanding what we mean by the

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:48.550
is understanding what we mean by the

00:11:55.050 --> 00:11:55.060
will turn to an interesting
 

00:11:55.060 --> 00:11:56.920
will turn to an interesting
representation of these thinkers have

00:11:56.920 --> 00:11:56.930
representation of these thinkers have
 

00:11:56.930 --> 00:11:58.509
representation of these thinkers have
tried to say well there really isn't a

00:11:58.509 --> 00:11:58.519
tried to say well there really isn't a
 

00:11:58.519 --> 00:12:01.629
tried to say well there really isn't a
problem in theory but it's only in

00:12:01.629 --> 00:12:01.639
problem in theory but it's only in
 

00:12:01.639 --> 00:12:03.220
problem in theory but it's only in
practice that there's a problem it's one

00:12:03.220 --> 00:12:03.230
practice that there's a problem it's one
 

00:12:03.230 --> 00:12:04.990
practice that there's a problem it's one
of my favorite quotes in this area i

00:12:04.990 --> 00:12:05.000
of my favorite quotes in this area i
 

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.600
of my favorite quotes in this area i
call it my tantalizing thought for the

00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:07.610
call it my tantalizing thought for the
 

00:12:07.610 --> 00:12:08.769
call it my tantalizing thought for the
day although i will conclude with

00:12:08.769 --> 00:12:08.779
day although i will conclude with
 

00:12:08.779 --> 00:12:11.920
day although i will conclude with
another tantalizing thought in theory it

00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:11.930
another tantalizing thought in theory it
 

00:12:11.930 --> 00:12:13.900
another tantalizing thought in theory it
has been said there is no difference

00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:13.910
has been said there is no difference
 

00:12:13.910 --> 00:12:15.879
has been said there is no difference
between theory and practice and how did

00:12:15.879 --> 00:12:15.889
between theory and practice and how did
 

00:12:15.889 --> 00:12:17.680
between theory and practice and how did
i understand this if you're doing it

00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:17.690
i understand this if you're doing it
 

00:12:17.690 --> 00:12:19.480
i understand this if you're doing it
right you should be able to show how the

00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:19.490
right you should be able to show how the
 

00:12:19.490 --> 00:12:21.910
right you should be able to show how the
theory connects you right back but of

00:12:21.910 --> 00:12:21.920
theory connects you right back but of
 

00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:24.100
theory connects you right back but of
course i will show in the next few

00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:24.110
course i will show in the next few
 

00:12:24.110 --> 00:12:28.030
course i will show in the next few
moments why in practice the effort to

00:12:28.030 --> 00:12:28.040
moments why in practice the effort to
 

00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:30.040
moments why in practice the effort to
make sense of that link between theory

00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:30.050
make sense of that link between theory
 

00:12:30.050 --> 00:12:31.990
make sense of that link between theory
and practice is often very hard and i

00:12:31.990 --> 00:12:32.000
and practice is often very hard and i

anyway so there's that tantalizing

00:13:23.290 --> 00:13:23.300
anyway so there's that tantalizing
 

00:13:23.300 --> 00:13:24.750
anyway so there's that tantalizing

why is there a problem if we know that

when you develop a theory you need to be

when you develop a theory you need to be
 

00:13:28.870 --> 00:13:31.170
when you develop a theory you need to be
able to show how it links back but there

00:13:31.170 --> 00:13:31.180
able to show how it links back but there
 

00:13:31.180 --> 00:13:34.230
able to show how it links back but there
is a problem in practice and here as I

00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:34.240
is a problem in practice and here as I
 

00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:36.660
is a problem in practice and here as I
understand the problem is how to make

00:13:36.660 --> 00:13:36.670
understand the problem is how to make
 

00:13:36.670 --> 00:13:38.820
understand the problem is how to make
sense of the various things we might be

worrying about when we say oh there's a

worrying about when we say oh there's a
 

00:13:42.130 --> 00:13:44.400
worrying about when we say oh there's a
gap between theory and practice and it's

00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:44.410
gap between theory and practice and it's
 

00:13:44.410 --> 00:13:45.630
gap between theory and practice and it's
a general rule you know when you're

00:13:45.630 --> 00:13:45.640
a general rule you know when you're
 

00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:47.370
a general rule you know when you're
reading these texts and contemporary

reading these texts and contemporary
civilization you will probably notice

civilization you will probably notice

civilization you will probably notice
that sometimes someone will offer some

00:13:52.050 --> 00:13:52.060
that sometimes someone will offer some
 

00:13:52.060 --> 00:13:55.560
that sometimes someone will offer some
kind of ism or some kind of claim that

00:13:55.560 --> 00:13:55.570
kind of ism or some kind of claim that

once you think deeply about it tends to

once you think deeply about it tends to
 

00:13:58.570 --> 00:14:00.930
once you think deeply about it tends to
conflate or run together many different

kinds of concerns and this is no more

00:14:03.630 --> 00:14:03.640
kinds of concerns and this is no more
 

00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:05.910
kinds of concerns and this is no more
true anywhere than it is when you're

00:14:05.910 --> 00:14:05.920
true anywhere than it is when you're
 

00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:08.220
true anywhere than it is when you're
talking about this problem of theory and

00:14:08.220 --> 00:14:08.230
talking about this problem of theory and
 

00:14:08.230 --> 00:14:10.560
talking about this problem of theory and
practice so here's as i was thinking

00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:10.570
practice so here's as i was thinking
 

00:14:10.570 --> 00:14:12.270
practice so here's as i was thinking
through again this is an experiment that

through again this is an experiment that
i put myself through and i'm taking you

i put myself through and i'm taking you
through with me here's what i thought r

is the list of things most people mean
 

00:14:19.270 --> 00:14:20.940
is the list of things most people mean
and there you will see they don't all

00:14:20.940 --> 00:14:20.950
and there you will see they don't all
 

00:14:20.950 --> 00:14:24.720

implications you might mean first that

00:14:27.930 --> 00:14:27.940
implications you might mean first that
 

00:14:27.940 --> 00:14:30.540
implications you might mean first that
some theories are just too remote from

some theories are just too remote from
 

00:14:30.550 --> 00:14:32.820
some theories are just too remote from

who's worried about theory and practice

00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:42.970
who's worried about theory and practice
 

00:14:42.970 --> 00:14:44.990
who's worried about theory and practice
probably means something like this

00:14:44.990 --> 00:14:45.000
probably means something like this
 

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.190
probably means something like this
second you might mean that even theories

00:14:47.190 --> 00:14:47.200
second you might mean that even theories
 

00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:49.200
second you might mean that even theories
that seamless remote are plagued by

00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:49.210
that seamless remote are plagued by
 

00:14:49.210 --> 00:14:51.870
that seamless remote are plagued by
certain gaps and I will identify a few

00:14:51.870 --> 00:14:51.880
certain gaps and I will identify a few
 

00:14:51.880 --> 00:14:53.910
certain gaps and I will identify a few
of them for you between theory and

00:14:53.910 --> 00:14:53.920
of them for you between theory and
 

00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:56.640
of them for you between theory and
practice that aren't easily bridged you

00:14:56.640 --> 00:14:56.650
practice that aren't easily bridged you
 

00:14:56.650 --> 00:14:58.710
practice that aren't easily bridged you
might mean also that some domains of

00:14:58.710 --> 00:14:58.720
might mean also that some domains of
 

00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:01.440
might mean also that some domains of
inquiry just generate too many theories

00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:01.450
inquiry just generate too many theories
 

00:15:01.450 --> 00:15:04.530
inquiry just generate too many theories
too many confuse that are actually too

00:15:04.530 --> 00:15:04.540
too many confuse that are actually too

frequently in conflict with one another
that's a very common objection to

00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:08.770
that's a very common objection to
 

00:15:08.770 --> 00:15:11.910
that's a very common objection to
political and social thought you might

00:15:11.910 --> 00:15:11.920
political and social thought you might
 

00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:14.010
political and social thought you might
mean fourthly that theory and theorizing

00:15:14.010 --> 00:15:14.020
mean fourthly that theory and theorizing
 

00:15:14.020 --> 00:15:16.290
mean fourthly that theory and theorizing
are dangerous in some way because they

00:15:16.290 --> 00:15:16.300
are dangerous in some way because they
 

00:15:16.300 --> 00:15:18.960
are dangerous in some way because they
remove you too much from the world of

remove you too much from the world of
 

00:15:18.970 --> 00:15:21.060
remove you too much from the world of
experience and practice they distract

you and you might mean that some

00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:23.170
you and you might mean that some
 

00:15:23.170 --> 00:15:26.160

don't think it's necessarily worse i'm

and gentlemen come up in science they

00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:21.210
and gentlemen come up in science they
 

00:19:21.210 --> 00:19:23.720
and gentlemen come up in science they
come up in contemporary science and they

come up in contemporary science and they
 

00:19:23.730 --> 00:19:25.940
come up in contemporary science and they
do so in many unexpected places and

00:19:25.940 --> 00:19:25.950
do so in many unexpected places and
 

00:19:25.950 --> 00:19:28.040
do so in many unexpected places and
again this was some of the research and

00:19:28.040 --> 00:19:28.050
again this was some of the research and
 

00:19:28.050 --> 00:19:30.290
again this was some of the research and
thinking I did sort of layered on to

00:19:30.290 --> 00:19:30.300
thinking I did sort of layered on to
 

00:19:30.300 --> 00:19:31.820
thinking I did sort of layered on to
thinking about the texts and

00:19:31.820 --> 00:19:31.830
thinking about the texts and
 

00:19:31.830 --> 00:19:34.250
thinking about the texts and
contemporary civilization but just about

saying look why would anybody go into

saying look why would anybody go into
 

00:20:35.929 --> 00:20:38.379

about conserving species why assume that

about conserving species why assume that
 

00:20:41.719 --> 00:20:43.599
about conserving species why assume that
the theory is intrinsically too remote

what do the biologists need to do to

00:20:46.119 --> 00:20:46.129
what do the biologists need to do to
 

00:20:46.129 --> 00:20:48.399
what do the biologists need to do to
make the links to practice clearer but

00:20:48.399 --> 00:20:48.409
make the links to practice clearer but
 

00:20:48.409 --> 00:20:51.129
make the links to practice clearer but
then I found a second example that was

00:20:51.129 --> 00:20:51.139
then I found a second example that was
 

00:20:51.139 --> 00:20:52.749
then I found a second example that was
even in some ways more interesting

00:20:52.749 --> 00:20:52.759
even in some ways more interesting
 

00:20:52.759 --> 00:20:54.699
even in some ways more interesting
because it wasn't about non-scientists

because it wasn't about non-scientists
 

00:20:54.709 --> 00:20:56.979
because it wasn't about non-scientists
talking to scientists it was about

00:20:56.979 --> 00:20:56.989
talking to scientists it was about
 

00:20:56.989 --> 00:20:59.289
talking to scientists it was about

experimental biologists look at them and

00:21:36.879 --> 00:21:36.889
experimental biologists look at them and
 

00:21:36.889 --> 00:21:38.829
experimental biologists look at them and
say what are we supposed to do with this

00:21:38.829 --> 00:21:38.839
say what are we supposed to do with this
 

00:21:38.839 --> 00:21:41.379

how do I translate this into my practice

as an experimental biologists this was

as an experimental biologists this was
 

00:21:43.729 --> 00:21:46.419
as an experimental biologists this was

issue devoted to trying to convince
 

00:21:52.689 --> 00:21:55.029
issue devoted to trying to convince
experimental biologists with an interest

00:21:55.029 --> 00:21:55.039
experimental biologists with an interest
 

00:21:55.039 --> 00:21:57.429
experimental biologists with an interest
in the brain that they could learn from

00:21:57.429 --> 00:21:57.439
in the brain that they could learn from
 

00:21:57.439 --> 00:22:01.209
in the brain that they could learn from
the computational neuroscientist but we

00:22:01.209 --> 00:22:01.219
the computational neuroscientist but we
 

00:22:01.219 --> 00:22:04.329
the computational neuroscientist but we
can talk about a remedy for remoteness

00:22:04.329 --> 00:22:04.339
can talk about a remedy for remoteness
 

00:22:04.339 --> 00:22:08.079
can talk about a remedy for remoteness
and I think it's important to say right

00:22:08.079 --> 00:22:08.089
and I think it's important to say right
 

00:22:08.089 --> 00:22:09.819
and I think it's important to say right
off maybe it is going to be easier in

00:22:09.819 --> 00:22:09.829
off maybe it is going to be easier in
 

00:22:09.829 --> 00:22:11.739
off maybe it is going to be easier in
the sciences but the remedy is to try to

00:22:11.739 --> 00:22:11.749
the sciences but the remedy is to try to
 

00:22:11.749 --> 00:22:14.019
the sciences but the remedy is to try to
strike a better balance between theory

00:22:14.019 --> 00:22:14.029
strike a better balance between theory
 

00:22:14.029 --> 00:22:15.699
strike a better balance between theory
and practice and some of the things you

00:22:15.699 --> 00:22:15.709
and practice and some of the things you
 

00:22:15.709 --> 00:22:17.940
and practice and some of the things you
might do this is not a complete list

00:22:17.940 --> 00:22:17.950
might do this is not a complete list
 

00:22:17.950 --> 00:22:20.129
might do this is not a complete list
so because my question is how can theory

00:22:20.129 --> 00:22:20.139
so because my question is how can theory
 

00:22:20.139 --> 00:22:21.629
so because my question is how can theory
make a difference to practice well

00:22:21.629 --> 00:22:21.639
make a difference to practice well
 

00:22:21.639 --> 00:22:23.639
make a difference to practice well
here's a case try to get better

00:22:23.639 --> 00:22:23.649
here's a case try to get better
 

00:22:23.649 --> 00:22:26.070
here's a case try to get better
communication between the theorists and

we'll have to understand practitioner in

00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:30.490
we'll have to understand practitioner in
 

00:22:30.490 --> 00:22:33.029
we'll have to understand practitioner in
a very broad way in the neuroscience

important fact so how do you address the
 

00:38:15.599 --> 00:38:17.299
important fact so how do you address the
attainability gap well here's what I

00:38:17.299 --> 00:38:17.309
attainability gap well here's what I
 

00:38:17.309 --> 00:38:18.920

and you know to take an example you know

a lot of people and does that make it a

a lot of people and does that make it a
