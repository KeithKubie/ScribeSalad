ix nitric oxide really is a very
 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.440
ix nitric oxide really is a very
important gas that's produced by cells

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450
important gas that's produced by cells
 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.690
important gas that's produced by cells
throughout the body it's really

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700
throughout the body it's really
 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.260
throughout the body it's really
important for blood pressure regulation

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:17.270
important for blood pressure regulation
 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:20.570
important for blood pressure regulation
for protection of the heart protection

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580
for protection of the heart protection
 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.460
for protection of the heart protection
of organs in general across the body and

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470
of organs in general across the body and
 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.830
of organs in general across the body and
the issue is that nitric oxide has a

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840
the issue is that nitric oxide has a
 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.850
the issue is that nitric oxide has a
very short half-life it only remains in

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:28.860
very short half-life it only remains in
 

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:31.250
very short half-life it only remains in
the body for a few seconds it's a free

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260
the body for a few seconds it's a free
 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.470
the body for a few seconds it's a free
radical species and it's rapidly broken

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480
radical species and it's rapidly broken
 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.840
radical species and it's rapidly broken
down and so one of the problems in

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850
down and so one of the problems in
 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.670
down and so one of the problems in
translation to the clinic has been how

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680
translation to the clinic has been how
 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.420
translation to the clinic has been how
to deliver nitric oxide therapies over a

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430
to deliver nitric oxide therapies over a
 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.120
to deliver nitric oxide therapies over a
long term or more chronic basis in

half-life is actually rapidly broken
 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.860
half-life is actually rapidly broken
down into a molecule called nitrite and

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870
down into a molecule called nitrite and
 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.900
down into a molecule called nitrite and
nitrite appears to be a very stable

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910
nitrite appears to be a very stable
 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.569

back into nitric oxide during conditions

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:01.860
back into nitric oxide during conditions
 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:04.759
back into nitric oxide during conditions
of hypoxia or ischemia such as might

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769
of hypoxia or ischemia such as might
 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.139
of hypoxia or ischemia such as might
happen during a heart attack or a stroke

00:01:06.139 --> 00:01:06.149
happen during a heart attack or a stroke
 

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:09.760
happen during a heart attack or a stroke
and now scientists are really

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:09.770
and now scientists are really
 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:12.590
and now scientists are really
investigating how we can harness the the

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600
investigating how we can harness the the
 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.139
investigating how we can harness the the
use of nitrite to deliver nitric oxide

00:01:15.139 --> 00:01:15.149
use of nitrite to deliver nitric oxide
 

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:17.330
use of nitrite to deliver nitric oxide
during cardiovascular diseases and a

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340
during cardiovascular diseases and a
 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.669
during cardiovascular diseases and a
number of other diseases and of interest

00:01:19.669 --> 00:01:19.679
number of other diseases and of interest
 

00:01:19.679 --> 00:01:22.730
number of other diseases and of interest
is the idea that green leafy vegetables

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740
is the idea that green leafy vegetables
 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.349
is the idea that green leafy vegetables
that have been thought to be healthy for

00:01:24.349 --> 00:01:24.359
that have been thought to be healthy for
 

00:01:24.359 --> 00:01:26.149
that have been thought to be healthy for
many years actually contain contain

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159
many years actually contain contain
 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.419
many years actually contain contain
levels of nitrite and nitrate and

00:01:29.419 --> 00:01:29.429
levels of nitrite and nitrate and
 

00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:31.279
levels of nitrite and nitrate and
nitrate can be converted back into

00:01:31.279 --> 00:01:31.289
nitrate can be converted back into
 

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:33.739
nitrate can be converted back into
nitrite and then into nitric oxide so

00:01:33.739 --> 00:01:33.749
nitrite and then into nitric oxide so
 

00:01:33.749 --> 00:01:36.050
nitrite and then into nitric oxide so
now we have a way that we can modify our

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060
now we have a way that we can modify our
 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.029
now we have a way that we can modify our
diet in a healthy manner it's also

00:01:38.029 --> 00:01:38.039
diet in a healthy manner it's also
 

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:39.410
diet in a healthy manner it's also
interesting to note that people that

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420
interesting to note that people that
 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.389
interesting to note that people that
have diseases cardiovascular diseases

00:01:41.389 --> 00:01:41.399
have diseases cardiovascular diseases
 

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:43.699
have diseases cardiovascular diseases
and other diseases have very low levels

00:01:43.699 --> 00:01:43.709
and other diseases have very low levels
 

00:01:43.709 --> 00:01:46.550
and other diseases have very low levels
of nitrite and nitrate in their bodies

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560
of nitrite and nitrate in their bodies
 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.219
of nitrite and nitrate in their bodies
and so this begs the question could we

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229
and so this begs the question could we
 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.980
and so this begs the question could we
improve their health by increasing the

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990
improve their health by increasing the
 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.569
improve their health by increasing the
amount of nitrite and nitrate in their

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579
amount of nitrite and nitrate in their
 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:57.830
amount of nitrite and nitrate in their
diet nitric oxide is has a very short

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840
diet nitric oxide is has a very short
 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.440
diet nitric oxide is has a very short
half-life in the body and many of its

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450
half-life in the body and many of its
 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.629
half-life in the body and many of its
very powerful protective effects are

00:02:02.629 --> 00:02:02.639
very powerful protective effects are
 

00:02:02.639 --> 00:02:05.539
very powerful protective effects are
difficult to harness with nitric oxide

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549
difficult to harness with nitric oxide
 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.909
difficult to harness with nitric oxide
based drugs however scientists

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:07.919
based drugs however scientists
 

00:02:07.919 --> 00:02:10.669
based drugs however scientists
discovered that nitric oxide is actually

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679
discovered that nitric oxide is actually
 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.820
discovered that nitric oxide is actually
broken down into nitrite and nitrite is

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830
broken down into nitrite and nitrite is
 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.130
broken down into nitrite and nitrite is
incredibly stable in the body it sticks

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140
incredibly stable in the body it sticks
 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.890
incredibly stable in the body it sticks
around for a long period of time however

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900
around for a long period of time however
 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:19.860
around for a long period of time however
when the

some disease state nitrite is rapidly
 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:28.500
some disease state nitrite is rapidly
converted directly into nitric oxide or

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510
converted directly into nitric oxide or
 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:31.589
converted directly into nitric oxide or
enno as it's called and this enno can

00:02:31.589 --> 00:02:31.599
enno as it's called and this enno can
 

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:33.960
enno as it's called and this enno can
then exert beneficial effects dilate

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970
then exert beneficial effects dilate
 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:35.970
then exert beneficial effects dilate
blood vessels improve blood flow and

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980
blood vessels improve blood flow and
 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:38.190
blood vessels improve blood flow and
alleviate the low blood flow or the

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200
alleviate the low blood flow or the
 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:39.780
alleviate the low blood flow or the
hypoxic condition and this could be
