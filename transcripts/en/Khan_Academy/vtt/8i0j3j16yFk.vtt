00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:01.550
Welcome back.

00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:05.620
So I was trying to rush and
finish a problem in the last

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:08.189
two minutes of the video, and
I realize that's just bad

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:09.980
teaching, because I
end up rushing.

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:11.810
So this is the problem we were
going to work on, and you'll

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:12.780
see a lot of these.

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.890
They just want you to become
familiar with the variables in

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:19.350
Newton's law of gravitation.

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.010
So I said that there's two
planets, one is Earth.

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.100
Now I have time to draw things,
so that's Earth.

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:28.830
And then there's Small Earth.

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.470
And Small Earth-- well, maybe
I'll just call it the small

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:34.370
planet, so we don't
get confused.

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:37.600
It's green, showing that
there's probably

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.300
life on that planet.

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.550
Let's say it has 1/2 the radius,
and 1/2 the mass.

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.625
So if you think about
it, it's probably a

00:00:46.625 --> 00:00:48.000
lot denser than Earth.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.550
That's a good problem
to think about.

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:51.150
How much denser is it, right?

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:55.520
Because if you have 1/2 the
radius, your volume is much

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:56.560
less than 1/2.

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:58.173
I don't want to go into that
now, but that's something for

00:00:58.173 --> 00:00:58.950
you to think about.

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:01.900
But my question is what
fraction, if I'm standing on

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:06.260
the surface of this-- so the
same person, so Sal, if I'm on

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:13.900
Earth, what fraction is the pull
when I'm on this small

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:15.390
green planet?

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.170
So what is the pull
on me on Earth?

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:23.620
Well, it's just going to be-- my
weight on Earth, the force

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:28.510
on Earth, is going to be equal
to the gravitational constant

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:35.160
times my mass, mass of me.

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:41.930
So m sub m times the mass of
Earth divided by what?

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:44.010
We learned in the last video,
divided by the distance

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:45.730
between me and the center
of the mass of Earth.

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:49.740
Really, my center of mass and
the center of mass of Earth.

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.820
But this is between the surface
of the Earth, and I'd

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:56.030
like to think that I'm not
short, but it's negligible

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:58.380
between my center of mass and
the surface, so we'll just

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.690
consider the radius
of the Earth.

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:05.290
So we divide it by the radius
of the Earth squared.

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:11.820
Using these same variables,
what's going to be the force

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:13.900
on this other planet?

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.490
So the force on the other
planet, this green planet--

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:20.930
I'll do it in green-- and we're
calling it the small

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:23.710
planet, it equals what?

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:26.810
It equals the gravitational
constant again.

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:29.240
And my mass doesn't change when
I go from one planet to

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:31.850
another, right?

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:33.620
Its mass now is what?

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.710
We would write it m
sub s here, right?

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:39.300
This is the small planet.

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.850
And we wrote right here that
it's 1/2 the mass of Earth, so

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:42.930
I'll just write that.

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:44.700
So it's 1/2 the mass of Earth.

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:49.900
And what's its radius?

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:51.750
What's the radius now?

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.100
I could just write the radius
of the small planet squared,

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.990
but I'll say, well, we know.

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:57.920
It's 1/2 the radius of Earth,
so let's put that in there.

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.290
So 1/2 radius of Earth.

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:02.420
We have to square it.

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.270
Let's see what this
simplifies to.

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:12.760
This equals-- so we can take
this 1/2 here-- 1/2G mass of

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:18.140
me times mass of Earth over--
what's 1/2 squared?

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:19.260
It's 1/4.

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:26.580
Over 1/4 radius of
Earth squared.

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:30.330
And what's 1/2 divided by 1/4?

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:32.420
1/4 goes into 1/2 two
times, right?

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:33.880
Or another way you can think
about it is if you have a

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:35.500
fraction in the denominator,
when you put it in the

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:38.020
numerator, you flip it
and it becomes 4.

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:39.060
So 4 times 1/2 is 2.

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.760
Either way, it's just math.

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.640
So the force on the small planet
is going to be equal to

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:53.030
1/2 divided by 1/4 is 2 times
G, mass of me, times mass of

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:56.930
Earth, divided by the radius
of Earth squared.

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:01.650
And if we look up here,
this is the same

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:05.445
thing as this, right?

00:04:05.445 --> 00:04:07.130
It's identical.

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:10.820
So we know that the force that
applied to me when I'm on the

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:15.660
surface of the small planet is
actually two times the force

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:19.180
applied on Earth, when
I go to Earth.

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:20.610
And that's something interesting
to think about,

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:24.830
because you might have said
initially, wow, you know, the

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:27.040
mass of the object matters
a lot in gravity.

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:29.270
The more massive the object,
the more it's

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:31.330
going to pull on me.

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:33.640
But what we see here is
that actually, no.

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:36.180
When I'm on the surface of
this smaller planet, it's

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:37.830
pulling even harder on me.

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:38.830
And why is that?

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:41.990
Well, because I'm actually
closer to its center of mass.

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:45.260
And as we talked about earlier
in this video, this object is

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:46.650
probably a lot denser.

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:50.350
You could say it's only 1/2 the
mass, but it's much less

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:51.780
than 1/2 of the volume, right?

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:55.090
Because the volume is the cube
of the radius and all of that.

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:56.920
I don't want to confuse you, but
this is just something to

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:57.610
think about.

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:59.480
So not only does the mass
matter, but the

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:01.970
radius matters a lot.

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:03.980
And the radius is actually the
square, so it actually

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:06.350
matters even more.

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:09.800
So that's something
that's pretty

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:10.430
interesting to think about.

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:14.080
And these are actually very
common problems when they just

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:16.680
want to tell you, oh, you go to
a planet that is two times

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:21.140
the mass of another planet, et
cetera, et cetera, what is the

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:23.090
difference in force
between the two?

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:25.570
And one thing I want you to
realize, actually, before I

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:29.050
finish this video since I do
have some extra time, when we

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:30.890
think about gravity, especially
with planets and

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:33.500
all of that, you always
feel like, oh, it's

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:36.400
Earth pulling on me.

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:41.750
Let's say that this is the
Earth, and the Earth is huge,

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:45.730
and this is a tiny spaceship
right here.

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:48.310
It's traveling.

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:50.190
You always think that
Earth is pulling on

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:51.150
the spaceship, right?

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:53.350
The gravitational
force of Earth.

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:57.070
But it actually turns out, when
we looked at the formula,

00:05:57.070 --> 00:05:57.980
the formula is symmetric.

00:05:57.980 --> 00:05:59.800
It's not really saying one
is pulling on the other.

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:01.570
They're actually saying
this is the force

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:03.420
between the two objects.

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:04.960
They're attracted
to each other.

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:13.580
So if the Earth is pulling on
me with the force of 500

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:16.820
Newtons, it actually turns out
that I am pulling on the Earth

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:18.920
with an equal and opposite
force of 5 Newtons.

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:20.420
We're pulling towards
each other.

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:23.140
It just feels like the Earth is,
at least from my point of

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:25.220
view, that the Earth
is pulling to me.

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:29.410
And we're actually both being
pulled towards the combined

00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:30.180
center of mass.

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:33.050
So in this situation, let's say
the Earth is pulling on

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:37.220
the spaceship with the force
of-- I don't know.

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:40.210
I'm making up numbers
now, but let's say

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:43.970
it's 1 million Newtons.

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:46.320
It actually turns out that the
spaceship will be pulling on

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:51.950
the Earth with the same force
of 1 million Newtons.

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:55.610
And they're both going to be
moved to the combined system's

00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:56.900
center of mass.

00:06:56.900 --> 00:07:00.320
And the combined system's center
of mass since the Earth

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:02.910
is so much more massive is
going to be very close to

00:07:02.910 --> 00:07:03.790
Earth's center of mass.

00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:05.770
It's probably going to
be very close to

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:06.450
Earth's center of mass.

00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:07.900
It's going to be like
right there, right?

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:12.070
So in this situation, Earth
won't be doing a lot of

00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:15.930
moving, but it will be pulled
in the direction of the

00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:18.340
spaceship, and the spaceship
will try to go to Earth's

00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:20.680
center of mass, but at some
point, probably the

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:24.750
atmosphere, or the rock that it
runs into, it won't be able

00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:27.640
to go much further and
it might crash

00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:28.610
right around there.

00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:31.420
Anyway, I wanted just to give
you the sense that it's not

00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:33.240
necessarily one object just
pulling on the other.

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:35.230
They're pulling towards
each other to their

00:07:35.230 --> 00:07:36.850
combined center of masses.

00:07:36.850 --> 00:07:40.650
It would make a lot more sense
if they had just two people

00:07:40.650 --> 00:07:42.210
floating in space, they actually
would have some

00:07:42.210 --> 00:07:43.900
gravity towards each other.

00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:47.110
It's almost a little romantic.

00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:48.970
They would float
to each other.

00:07:48.970 --> 00:07:52.910
And actually, you could
figure it out.

00:07:52.910 --> 00:07:55.030
I don't have the time to do
it, but you could use this

00:07:55.030 --> 00:07:58.010
formula and use the constant,
and you could figure out,

00:07:58.010 --> 00:08:00.350
well, what is the gravitational
attraction

00:08:00.350 --> 00:08:01.560
between two people?

00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:04.080
And what you'll see is that
between two people floating in

00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:06.850
space, there are other forms
of attraction that are

00:08:06.850 --> 00:08:09.150
probably stronger than their

00:08:09.150 --> 00:08:11.380
gravitational attraction, anyway.

00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:13.520
I'll let you ponder that
and I will see

00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:15.410
you in the next video.
