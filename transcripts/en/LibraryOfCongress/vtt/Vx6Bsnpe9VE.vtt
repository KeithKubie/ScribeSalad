&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Good morning.

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:15.440
I'm Carla Hayden, the
Librarian of Congress,

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:16.810
and I want to welcome you

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:19.960
to this very special
story time at the library.

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:21.960
I love reading; don't you?

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.850
It's so much fun to let
our imaginations run wild.

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:27.750
We're excited to be teaming

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.920
up with Miss Dolly
Parton's Imagination Library

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:33.910
to introduce you to
some wonderful authors

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:35.900
who will share their
stories with us.

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:39.830
Miss Parton's work through
her Imagination Library

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:41.920
is awe-inspiring.

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:46.060
She and her team have given
away over 100 million books

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:50.910
to help encourage young readers
like you across the world.

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.790
Here at the Library of
Congress, we share that passion

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:57.510
for developing young readers
and we know that the best way

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.770
to encourage people like you
to read is to make reading fun,

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:04.760
so that's what we're here to do.

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:06.790
I hope you enjoy
today's story time.

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:12.200
Even more, I hope you keep
reading at home and having fun.

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:17.620
Today we will warm up by singing
some songs, touching your toes,

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:22.390
and then get comfortable and
get ready to hear stories.

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:25.410
Now let's get started.

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:29.040
&gt;&gt; Caroline Quandt: Welcome,
everybody, to the Library

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.410
of Congress for our 6th Dolly
Parton Imagination Library

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:34.710
Story Time.

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.260
We're so happy you could
join us, and you at home.

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.040
So my name is Caroline Quandt.

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:43.140
We're going to be
featuring today,

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.130
since tomorrow is
the beginning of --

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:51.030
is our annual National Book
Festival, we're featuring two

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.210
of our authors, Matt de la
Pena and Danica McKellar.

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:59.030
So, but let's first start
with our hello song,

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:01.240
and we do some sign with it,

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:06.560
so the sign for hello is
you do a little salute, yes,

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.170
and then the sign for friends,
we're going to sing "Hello,

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.420
Friends" to the tune of
hello -- "Goodnight, Ladies,"

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.370
and there is signs, so the sign

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:21.700
for friends is you
take your index fingers

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:25.140
and you hug them one way
and then the other way,

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:29.600
and then it's time, you're going
to touch your imaginary watch,

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:39.000
and then to say, you touch
your mouth, and then hello.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.560
Hello, friends, hello,
friends, hello, friends,

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.960
it's time to say hello.

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:47.760
One more time.

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:56.790
Hello, friends, hello,
friends, hello, friends,

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:00.300
it's time to say hello.

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.020
Great job, okay.

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:09.500
Let's do our classic "Open, Shut
Them" to wake up our brains.

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:12.460
Open, shut them,
open, shut them,

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:17.980
give a little clap, clap, clap.

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:22.130
Open, shut them,
open, shut them,

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:26.150
put them in your lap, lap, lap.

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:30.100
Creep and crawl them,
creep and crawl them,

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:34.370
right up to your
chin, chin, chin.

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:41.050
Open up your little mouth,
but do not let them in.

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:42.350
One more time.

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:46.460
Open, shut them,
open, shut them,

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:50.560
give a little clap, clap, clap.

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.700
Open, shut them,
open, shut them,

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:58.620
put them in your lap, lap, lap.

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:02.890
Creep and crawl them,
creep and crawl them,

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:06.410
right up to your
chin, chin, chin.

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:14.000
Open up your little mouth,
but do not let them in.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.380
Good job. All right.

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:22.270
So let's welcome our first
author, Matt de la Pena,

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:25.640
to come up and read
his wonderful book,

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:28.140
Last Stop on Market Street.

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:34.550
&gt;&gt; Matt de la Pena: Just going
to grab the book right here.

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:35.850
&gt;&gt; Caroline Quandt: Okay.

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:37.150
[applause].

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:38.450
Here we go.

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:39.750
&gt;&gt; Matt de la Pena: Hello,
guys, how are you doing?

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:42.970
I'm excited to read to you from
Last Stop on Market Street.

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:53.580
C.J. pushed through the church
doors, skipped down the steps.

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:57.770
The outside air smelled like
freedom, but it also smelled

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:04.300
like rain, which freckled C.J.
shirt and dripped down his nose.

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:09.620
He ducked under his
nana's umbrella saying,

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:13.840
"How come we got to wait for
the bus in all this wet?"

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:16.730
"Trees get thirsty,
too," his nana told him.

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:20.330
"Don't you see that big one
drinking through a straw?"

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:24.200
C.J. looked for a long
time but never saw a straw.

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:27.380
And by the way, if you, little
guys, if you can see the straw

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:29.520
that that tree is drinking from,

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:31.630
then you understand
the entire book.

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:38.000
But we won't get into that now.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.610
From the bus stop, he watched
water pool on flower petals,

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:47.180
watched rain patter against
the windshield of a nearby car.

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:50.760
His friend Colby climbed
in, gave C.J. a wave,

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:53.680
and drove off with his dad.

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:56.950
"Nana, how come we
don't got a car?"

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:03.880
"Boy, what do we need a car for?

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:07.030
We got a bus that breathes
fire, and old Mr. Dennis

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:10.160
who always has a trick for you."

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:13.240
The bus creaked to a
stop in front of them.

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:20.340
It sighed and sagged and
the doors swung open.

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:21.670
"What's that I see?"

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:24.070
Mr. Dennis asked.

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:27.130
He pulled a coin from
behind C.J.'s ear,

00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:29.490
placed it in his palm.

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:33.970
Nana laughed her deep laugh
and pushed C.J. along.

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:37.900
They sat right up
front, which, by the way,

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:39.700
is one of the most
important lines in the book

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:42.520
and nobody really
talks about it.

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:45.640
The man across the way
was tuning a guitar.

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:50.200
An old woman with curlers
had butterflies in a jar.

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:55.240
Nana gave everyone a great big
smile and a good afternoon.

00:06:55.240 --> 00:07:00.830
She made sure C.J. did the same.

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:04.040
The bus lurched forward
and stopped,

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:05.880
lurched forward and stopped.

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:08.060
Nana hummed as she knit.

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:11.500
"How come we always got
to go here after church?"

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:12.800
C.J. said.

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:16.360
"Miguel and Colby never
have to go nowhere."

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:18.750
"I feel sorry for those
boys," she told him.

00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:23.600
"They'll never get a chance to
meet Bobo or the Sunglass Man,

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:27.330
and I hear Trixie got
herself a brand-new hat."

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:31.510
C.J. stared out the window
feeling sorry for himself.

00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:35.560
He watched cars zip by on
either side, watched a group

00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:39.520
of boys hop curbs on bikes.

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:45.300
A man climbed aboard
with a spotted dog.

00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:47.650
C.J. gave up his seat.

00:07:47.650 --> 00:07:51.380
"How come that man can't see?"

00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:52.970
"Boy, what do you
know about seeing?"

00:07:52.970 --> 00:07:54.390
his nana told him.

00:07:54.390 --> 00:07:58.150
"Some people watch the
world with their ears."

00:07:58.150 --> 00:07:59.520
"That's a fact.

00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:01.980
Their noses, too," the man
said, sniffing at the air.

00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:05.580
"That's a mighty fine perfume
you're wearing today, ma'am."

00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:10.460
Nana squeezed the man's hand
and laughed her deep laugh.

00:08:13.030 --> 00:08:15.430
Two older boys got on next.

00:08:15.430 --> 00:08:20.870
C.J. watched as they moved
on by and stood in back.

00:08:20.870 --> 00:08:22.700
"Sure wish I had one
of those," he said.

00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:24.500
And if you can't
see in the back,

00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:26.210
they're listening to headphones.

00:08:26.210 --> 00:08:30.710
They probably have
an iPhone or iPod.

00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:32.280
Nana set down her knitting.

00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:34.890
And by the way, if your
grandmother ever sets

00:08:34.890 --> 00:08:36.910
down her knitting, you know
you might be in trouble.

00:08:36.910 --> 00:08:38.790
[laughter].

00:08:38.790 --> 00:08:40.090
"What for?

00:08:40.090 --> 00:08:43.070
You got the real-life thing
sitting across from you.

00:08:43.070 --> 00:08:46.520
Why don't you ask the man
if he'll play us a song?"

00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:48.110
C.J. didn't have to.

00:08:48.110 --> 00:08:50.750
The guitar player was
already plucking strings

00:08:50.750 --> 00:08:52.910
and beginning to sing.

00:08:52.910 --> 00:08:56.410
"To feel the magic of music,"
the blind man whispered,

00:08:56.410 --> 00:08:58.750
"I like to close my eyes."

00:08:58.750 --> 00:09:01.100
Nana closed hers, too.

00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:04.860
So did C.J. and the spotted dog.

00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:10.860
And in the darkness,
the rhythm lifted C.J.

00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:14.250
out of the bus, out
of the busy city.

00:09:14.250 --> 00:09:18.530
He saw sunset colors
swirling over crashing waves,

00:09:18.530 --> 00:09:22.010
saw a family of hawks
slicing through the sky,

00:09:22.010 --> 00:09:25.120
saw the old woman's
butterflies dancing free

00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:27.320
in the light of the moon.

00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:31.620
C.J.'s chest grew full and
he was lost in the sound,

00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:36.140
and the sound gave him
the feeling of magic.

00:09:37.330 --> 00:09:41.010
The song ended and
C.J. opened his eyes.

00:09:41.010 --> 00:09:45.480
Everyone on the bus clapped,
even the boys in back.

00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:49.580
Nana glanced at the
coin in C.J.'s palm.

00:09:49.580 --> 00:09:53.450
C.J. dropped it in
the man's hat.

00:09:53.450 --> 00:09:56.970
"Last stop on Market
Street," Mr. Dennis called.

00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:05.590
C.J. looked around as
he stepped off the bus.

00:10:05.590 --> 00:10:09.070
Crumbling sidewalks
and broken-down doors,

00:10:09.070 --> 00:10:12.080
graffiti-tagged windows
and boarded-up stores.

00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:14.990
He reached for his nana's hands.

00:10:14.990 --> 00:10:18.780
"How come it's always
so dirty over here?"

00:10:18.780 --> 00:10:22.290
She smiled and pointed
to the sky.

00:10:22.290 --> 00:10:25.920
"Sometimes when you're
surrounded by dirt, C.J.,

00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:28.900
you're a better witness
for what's beautiful."

00:10:31.250 --> 00:10:35.680
C.J. saw the perfect rainbow
arcing over their soup kitchen.

00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:38.600
He wondered how his nana
always found beautiful

00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:40.820
where he never even
thought to look.

00:10:40.820 --> 00:10:44.860
He looked all around them again,
at the bus rounding the corner

00:10:44.860 --> 00:10:49.720
out of sight and the broken
street lamps still lit up right

00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:53.790
and the stray cat shadows
moving across the wall.

00:10:55.710 --> 00:10:58.210
When he spotted their
familiar faces in the window,

00:10:58.210 --> 00:11:00.510
he said, "I'm glad we came."

00:11:06.590 --> 00:11:10.470
He thought his nana might laugh
her deep laugh, but she didn't.

00:11:10.470 --> 00:11:13.690
She patted him on the
head and told him, "Me,

00:11:13.690 --> 00:11:15.780
too, C.J. Now come on."

00:11:15.780 --> 00:11:19.860
And the last page you see
C.J. and his grandmother,

00:11:19.860 --> 00:11:22.930
they're at the soup kitchen,
but they're not there to eat.

00:11:22.930 --> 00:11:24.230
They're there to serve.

00:11:24.230 --> 00:11:26.510
Thank you guys so much for
letting me read to you.

00:11:26.510 --> 00:11:34.800
[ Applause ]

00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:36.100
&gt;&gt; Caroline Quandt: Wonderful.

00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:37.400
Thank you, Matt.

00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:41.550
What a wonderful book about
community and finding value

00:11:41.550 --> 00:11:44.810
in the little things in
life and in giving, yes?

00:11:44.810 --> 00:11:50.470
All right, so now we're going
to do an adaptation of wheels

00:11:50.470 --> 00:11:53.170
on the bus that our
program director

00:11:53.170 --> 00:11:54.920
at the Young Readers Center
[indiscernible] and I wrote.

00:11:54.920 --> 00:12:00.510

Danica McKellar, who's
going to read one

[ Applause ]

00:14:12.430 --> 00:14:14.570
I'm so honored to be here.

00:14:14.570 --> 00:14:16.220
Thank you so much.

00:14:16.220 --> 00:14:18.560
I'm going to read
one of my books.

00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:20.480
It's called "Goodnight,
Numbers."

00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:24.520
It was written by me, that's
Danica McKellar, and illustrated

00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:28.580
by Alicia Padron, who also
just illustrated another book

00:14:28.580 --> 00:14:32.340
that I just came out with
called "Bathtime Mathtime."

00:14:32.340 --> 00:14:34.820
She does great illustrations,
so sweet.

00:14:34.820 --> 00:14:40.950
So how many of you guys
know how to count to 10?

00:14:40.950 --> 00:14:42.720
Anybody count to 10?

00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:45.130
Yeah? You can?

00:14:45.130 --> 00:14:46.990
Yeah? Very good.

00:14:46.990 --> 00:14:49.210
I know my son can.

00:14:49.210 --> 00:14:53.580
By the way, I dedicated
this book to Draco.

00:14:53.580 --> 00:14:54.880
That's my son.

00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:58.590
He's seven years old and
he's sitting over there.

00:14:58.590 --> 00:15:00.120
All right, you guys, ready?

00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:04.110
So this is a story about
getting ready for bed.

00:15:04.110 --> 00:15:08.740
It shows lots of different
families getting ready for bed

00:15:08.740 --> 00:15:15.360
and counting one to 10 as we do,
and on each page there's lots

00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:21.710
of things to count
of that number.

00:15:21.710 --> 00:15:23.010
So here we go.

00:15:23.010 --> 00:15:24.310
One. Goodnight, one fork.

00:15:24.310 --> 00:15:25.610
Goodnight, one spoon.

00:15:25.610 --> 00:15:26.910
Goodnight, one bowl.

00:15:26.910 --> 00:15:28.210
I'll see you soon.

00:15:28.210 --> 00:15:31.640
So we're just finishing
up dinner.

00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:35.040
What do you do after dinner?

00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:38.950
Wash your hands, right?

00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:43.640
Two. Goodnight, two hands.

00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:45.520
Goodnight, two feet.

00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:48.630
Goodnight, two ears.

00:15:48.630 --> 00:15:52.280
So small and sweet.

to put away our toys.

Goodnight, three wheels.

00:16:09.130 --> 00:16:13.500
That's on a tricycle.

00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:18.770
Goodnight, three cans.

00:16:18.770 --> 00:16:26.240
These are garbage cans,
because when my son was little,

00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:32.500
he used to love playing
with garbage cans.

00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:37.660
I don't know about you
guys, but he loved it.

00:16:37.660 --> 00:16:40.140

fun, right?

and pots and pans.

our doggie named Spartacus.

You see there's one,
two, three, four.

00:17:16.270 --> 00:17:22.550
There are other things that
there are four of, too.

00:17:22.550 --> 00:17:25.910
There are four buttons
on this cushion.

bubbles here in this picture.

splash in the tub?

00:17:58.380 --> 00:18:02.610
Yeah? Yeah, it's splashy.

00:18:02.610 --> 00:18:08.640
There are probably a lot more
than five splashes, right?

00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:10.370
Yeah. Six.

00:18:10.370 --> 00:18:18.640

get our PJs on, our pajamas.

days there are in a week?

00:23:11.430 --> 00:23:13.460
at the Washington
Convention Center.

00:23:13.460 --> 00:23:16.510
All right, so let's end
with our goodbye song,

00:23:16.510 --> 00:23:20.980
which is the opposite of the
"Hello," and to say goodbye,

00:23:20.980 --> 00:23:24.070
we just say goodbye, right?

00:23:24.070 --> 00:23:33.490
Goodbye, friends, goodbye,
friends, goodbye, friends,

00:23:33.490 --> 00:23:37.620
it's time to say goodbye.

00:23:37.620 --> 00:23:39.950
See you again.

00:23:39.950 --> 00:23:41.250
Bye-bye. [applause].
