00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:11.040
One of the most legendary ideas in the history
of psychology is located in an unassuming

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:18.290
triangle divided into five sections referred
to universally simply as ‘Maslow’s Pyramid

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:24.640
of Needs’.This profoundly influential pyramid
first saw the world in an academic journal

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:30.019
in the United States in 1943, where it was
crudely drawn in black and white and surrounded

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:36.510
by dense and jargon-rich text. It has since
become a mainstay of psychological analyses,

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.550
business presentations and TED Talks
– and grown ever more colourful and emphatic

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:47.050
in the process.The pyramid was the work of
a thirty-five year old Jewish psychologist

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:52.160
of Russian origins called Abraham Maslow,
who had been looking, since the start of his

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:58.120
professional career, for nothing less than
the meaning of life. No longer part of the

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:03.730
close-knit orthodox family of his youth, Maslow
wanted to find out what could make life purposeful

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:09.359
for people (himself included) in modern-day
America, a country where the pursuit of money

00:01:09.359 --> 00:01:15.429
and fame seemed to have eclipsed any more
interior or authentic aspirations. He saw

00:01:15.429 --> 00:01:20.249
psychology as the discipline that would enable
him to answer the yearnings and questions

00:01:20.249 --> 00:01:26.460
that people had once taken to religion. He suddenly saw that human beings could be said

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:32.549
to have essentially five different kinds of
need: on the one hand, the psychological or

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:37.259
what one could term, without any mysticism
being meant by the word, the spiritual and

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:43.450
on the other, the material. For Maslow, we
all start with a set of utterly non-negotiable

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:51.509
and basic physiological needs, for food, water,
warmth and rest. In addition, we have urgent

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:58.119
safety needs for bodily security and protection
from attack. But then we start to enter the

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:05.029
spiritual domain. We need belongingness and
love. We need friends and lovers, we need

00:02:05.029 --> 00:02:11.550
esteem and respect. And lastly, and most grandly,
we are driven by what Maslow called – in

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:19.769
a now legendary term – an urge for self-actualization:
a vast, touchingly nebulous and yet hugely

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:25.790
apt concept involving what Maslow described
as ‘living according to one’s full potential’

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:29.002
and ‘becoming who we really are.’  Part of

00:02:29.002 --> 00:02:34.720
the reason why the description of these needs,
laid out in pyramid-form, has proved so persuasive

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:38.590
is their capacity to capture, with elemental
simplicity, a profound structural truth about

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:44.530
human existence. Maslow was putting his finger,
with unusual deftness and precision, on a

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:50.340
set of answers to very large questions that
tend to confuse and perplex us viciously,

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:56.519
particularly when we are young, namely: What
are we really after? What do we long for?

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:01.319
And how do we arrange our priorities and give
due regard for the different and competing

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:07.579
claims we have on our attention? Maslow was
reminding us with artistic concision of the

00:03:07.579 --> 00:03:13.890
shape of an ideal well-lived life, proposing
at once that we cannot live by our spiritual

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:19.870
callings alone, but also that it cannot be
right to remain focused only on the material

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:27.340
either. We need, to be whole, both the material
and the spiritual realms to be attended to,

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:33.579
the base lending support while the summit
offers upward direction and definition. Maslow

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:40.440
was rebutting calls from two kinds of zealots:
firstly, over-ardent spiritual types who might

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:45.950
urge us to forget entirely about money, housing,
a good insurance policy and enough to pay

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:52.359
for lunch. But he was also fighting against
extreme hard-nosed pragmatists who might imply

00:03:52.359 --> 00:03:58.239
that life was simply a brute process of putting
food on the table and going to the office.

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:03.689
Both camps had – for Maslow – misunderstood
the complexity of the human animal. Unlike

00:04:03.689 --> 00:04:09.660
other creatures, we truly are multifaceted,
called at once to unfurl our soul according

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:17.190
to its inner destiny – and to make sure
we can pay the bills at the end of the month. Operating

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:22.960
at the heyday of American capitalism, Maslow
was interestingly ambivalent about business.

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:28.830
He was awed by the material resources of large
corporations around him but at the same time

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:35.050
he lamented that almost all their economic
activity was – unfairly and bizarrely – focused

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:40.340
on honouring customers’ needs at the bottom
of his pyramid. America’s largest companies

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:45.610
were helping people to have a roof of their
heads, feeding them, moving them around and

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:51.150
ensuring they could talk to each other long-distance.
But they seemed utterly uninterested in trying

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:57.389
to fulfill the essential spiritual appetites
defined on the higher slopes of his pyramid.

00:04:57.389 --> 00:05:02.560
Towards the end of his long life, Maslow expressed
a hope that businesses could in time learn

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:07.800
to make more of their profits from addressing
not only our basic needs but also – and

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:13.400
as importantly – our higher spiritual and
psychological ones as well. That would be

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:19.960
truly enlightened capitalism. In the personal
sphere, Maslow’s pyramid remains a hugely

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:25.970
useful object to turn to whenever we are trying
to assess the direction of our lives. Often,

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:30.940
as we reflect upon it, we start to notice
that we really haven’t arranged and balanced

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:38.069
our needs as wisely and elegantly as we might.
Some lives have got an implausibly wide base:

00:05:38.069 --> 00:05:43.130
all the energy seems directed towards material
accumulation. At the same time, there are

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:47.479
lives with the opposite problem, where we
have not paid due head to our need to look

00:05:47.479 --> 00:05:51.790
after our fragile and vulnerable bodies. Maslow
was pointing us to the need for a greater

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:53.009
balance between the many priorities we must
juggle. His beautifully simple visual cue

00:05:53.009 --> 00:05:59.060
is, above anything else, a portrait of a life
lived in harmony with the complexities of

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:05.259
our nature. We should, at our less frantic
moments, use it to reflect with newfound focus

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:07.680
on what it is we might do next.
