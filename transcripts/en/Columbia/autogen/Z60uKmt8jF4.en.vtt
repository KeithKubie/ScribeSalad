nobody studied bioethics then there was
 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:35.789
nobody studied bioethics then there was
no place to study it and the term

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:35.799

1971 or 72 so if you'd you know if your
 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:47.510
1971 or 72 so if you'd you know if your
spell check would have rejected it as

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520

00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:47.090
classroom and were actually being
exposed to patients and so we often

00:18:47.090 --> 00:18:47.100
exposed to patients and so we often
 

00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:50.180
exposed to patients and so we often
taught off actual patients that the

00:18:50.180 --> 00:18:50.190
taught off actual patients that the
 

00:18:50.190 --> 00:18:52.160
taught off actual patients that the
medical students had been seeing and

00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:52.170
medical students had been seeing and
 

00:18:52.170 --> 00:18:55.880
medical students had been seeing and
they usually did the teaching combining

00:18:55.880 --> 00:18:55.890
they usually did the teaching combining
 

00:18:55.890 --> 00:18:57.890
they usually did the teaching combining
the medical students with the particular

00:18:57.890 --> 00:18:57.900
the medical students with the particular
 

00:18:57.900 --> 00:18:59.990
the medical students with the particular
residency team that they were attached

00:18:59.990 --> 00:19:00.000
residency team that they were attached
 

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.330
residency team that they were attached
to at the time which gave a little more

00:19:02.330 --> 00:19:02.340
to at the time which gave a little more
 

00:19:02.340 --> 00:19:08.090
to at the time which gave a little more
experience to the group and it worked

00:19:08.090 --> 00:19:08.100
experience to the group and it worked
 

00:19:08.100 --> 00:19:11.090
experience to the group and it worked
quite well in teaching in medical

the group was was broken down into

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:50.010
the group was was broken down into
 

00:22:50.010 --> 00:22:51.919
the group was was broken down into
different working groups and by this

00:22:51.919 --> 00:22:51.929
different working groups and by this
 

00:22:51.929 --> 00:22:54.740
different working groups and by this
time ethics was more on the map they had

00:22:54.740 --> 00:22:54.750
time ethics was more on the map they had
 

00:22:54.750 --> 00:22:57.260
time ethics was more on the map they had
an ethics working group fifteen years

00:22:57.260 --> 00:22:57.270
an ethics working group fifteen years
 

00:22:57.270 --> 00:22:58.669
an ethics working group fifteen years
before that nobody would have ever

before that nobody would have ever
 

00:22:58.679 --> 00:23:00.860
before that nobody would have ever
thought of doing anything like that and

00:23:00.860 --> 00:23:00.870
thought of doing anything like that and
 

00:23:00.870 --> 00:23:03.409
thought of doing anything like that and
you guys will all benefit from the fact

00:23:03.409 --> 00:23:03.419
you guys will all benefit from the fact

you guys will all benefit from the fact
that bioethics has earned a place in

that bioethics has earned a place in
 

00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:11.510
that bioethics has earned a place in
efforts like this that twenty years ago

00:23:11.510 --> 00:23:11.520
efforts like this that twenty years ago
 

00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:14.000

certainly didn't in any case they had an
ethics working group and I was asked to

00:23:19.610 --> 00:23:19.620
ethics working group and I was asked to
 

00:23:19.620 --> 00:23:22.820
ethics working group and I was asked to
be on that there were about twenty

00:23:22.820 --> 00:23:22.830
be on that there were about twenty
 

00:23:22.830 --> 00:23:26.870
be on that there were about twenty
twenty four people on it all it had to

00:23:26.870 --> 00:23:26.880
twenty four people on it all it had to
 

00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:29.659
twenty four people on it all it had to
be diverse in any in every respect that

00:23:29.659 --> 00:23:29.669
be diverse in any in every respect that
 

00:23:29.669 --> 00:23:32.690
be diverse in any in every respect that
you can think of training people had

ethnic groups racial groups gender etc
 

00:23:36.510 --> 00:23:38.960
ethnic groups racial groups gender etc
it was quite diverse it was interesting

00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:38.970
it was quite diverse it was interesting
 

00:23:38.970 --> 00:23:43.100
it was quite diverse it was interesting
because bioethics up till then was

00:23:43.100 --> 00:23:43.110
because bioethics up till then was
 

00:23:43.110 --> 00:23:46.899
because bioethics up till then was
pretty much focused on clinical issues

00:23:46.899 --> 00:23:46.909

there's something wrong there but

with issues like this so one of the
 

00:46:22.700 --> 00:46:26.920
with issues like this so one of the
examples was if you wanted to set up the

00:46:26.920 --> 00:46:26.930
examples was if you wanted to set up the
 

00:46:26.930 --> 00:46:29.260
examples was if you wanted to set up the

countries on antiretrovirals what would
 

00:46:35.990 --> 00:46:38.710
countries on antiretrovirals what would
you do you would simply ignore

00:46:38.710 --> 00:46:38.720
you do you would simply ignore
 

00:46:38.720 --> 00:46:41.140
you do you would simply ignore
people in rural areas you would only

00:46:41.140 --> 00:46:41.150
people in rural areas you would only
 

00:46:41.150 --> 00:46:43.750
people in rural areas you would only
treat people in urban areas why because

00:46:43.750 --> 00:46:43.760
treat people in urban areas why because
 

00:46:43.760 --> 00:46:47.500
treat people in urban areas why because
they were in denser and so cheaper and

00:46:47.500 --> 00:46:47.510
they were in denser and so cheaper and
 

00:46:47.510 --> 00:46:50.260
they were in denser and so cheaper and
you already had more health facilities

00:46:50.260 --> 00:46:50.270
you already had more health facilities
 

00:46:50.270 --> 00:46:53.109
you already had more health facilities

00:57:17.700 --> 00:57:17.710
clinical stuff and that we turned out
 

00:57:17.710 --> 00:57:19.830

get a page you first need to get a

masters you don't go from college to a

01:08:00.320 --> 01:08:00.330
masters you don't go from college to a
 

01:08:00.330 --> 01:08:02.330
masters you don't go from college to a
deep go from college to a master's

01:08:02.330 --> 01:08:02.340
deep go from college to a master's
 

01:08:02.340 --> 01:08:03.109

program

01:08:03.109 --> 01:08:03.119
program
 

01:08:03.119 --> 01:08:04.880
program
some people decide they want to do a

01:08:04.880 --> 01:08:04.890
some people decide they want to do a
 

01:08:04.890 --> 01:08:06.680
some people decide they want to do a
master's in public health or master's in

01:08:06.680 --> 01:08:06.690
master's in public health or master's in
 

01:08:06.690 --> 01:08:08.690
master's in public health or master's in
public policy in the cetera yeah I think

01:08:08.690 --> 01:08:08.700
public policy in the cetera yeah I think
 

01:08:08.700 --> 01:08:12.769
public policy in the cetera yeah I think
so it's a master's this is a step toward

01:08:12.769 --> 01:08:12.779
so it's a master's this is a step toward
 

01:08:12.779 --> 01:08:15.349
so it's a master's this is a step toward
the PhD it's not an either/or it's one

01:08:15.349 --> 01:08:15.359
the PhD it's not an either/or it's one
 

01:08:15.359 --> 01:08:17.269
the PhD it's not an either/or it's one
and then the other one and it's also the

01:08:17.269 --> 01:08:17.279
and then the other one and it's also the
 

01:08:17.279 --> 01:08:19.459
and then the other one and it's also the
case that if you're also doing if you're

01:08:19.459 --> 01:08:19.469
case that if you're also doing if you're
 

01:08:19.469 --> 01:08:22.629
case that if you're also doing if you're
going to medical school

01:08:22.629 --> 01:08:22.639
 
 

01:08:22.639 --> 01:08:28.189
 
then I don't that will sort of play the

01:08:28.189 --> 01:08:28.199
then I don't that will sort of play the
 

01:08:28.199 --> 01:08:30.620
then I don't that will sort of play the
role of the PhD you will do slightly

01:08:30.620 --> 01:08:30.630
role of the PhD you will do slightly
 

01:08:30.630 --> 01:08:34.599
role of the PhD you will do slightly
different kinds of things but you'll be

01:08:34.599 --> 01:08:34.609
different kinds of things but you'll be
 

01:08:34.609 --> 01:08:37.010
different kinds of things but you'll be

bioethicists who publish and so forth
 

01:08:41.609 --> 01:08:46.609
bioethicists who publish and so forth
are probably Doc's so I wasn't trying to

01:08:46.609 --> 01:08:46.619
are probably Doc's so I wasn't trying to
 

01:08:46.619 --> 01:08:52.160
are probably Doc's so I wasn't trying to
push it came out wrong if your master's

01:08:52.160 --> 01:08:52.170
push it came out wrong if your master's
 

01:08:52.170 --> 01:08:55.789

in bioethics is your only training

01:08:55.789 --> 01:08:55.799
in bioethics is your only training
 

01:08:55.799 --> 01:08:59.059
in bioethics is your only training
beyond undergraduate work then I think

01:08:59.059 --> 01:08:59.069
beyond undergraduate work then I think
 

01:08:59.069 --> 01:09:00.849
beyond undergraduate work then I think
you're probably not going to be able to

01:09:00.849 --> 01:09:00.859
you're probably not going to be able to
 

01:09:00.859 --> 01:09:04.820
you're probably not going to be able to
work at as a sophisticated level as if

01:09:04.820 --> 01:09:04.830
work at as a sophisticated level as if
 

01:09:04.830 --> 01:09:08.269
work at as a sophisticated level as if
you have a law degree a medical degree a

you have a law degree a medical degree a

public health degree whatever it's that
 

01:09:13.560 --> 01:09:18.800
public health degree whatever it's that
kind of training forces you to push

01:09:18.800 --> 01:09:18.810
kind of training forces you to push
 

01:09:18.810 --> 01:09:32.410

01:10:42.360 --> 01:10:45.500
parallel situation it's a little
paradoxical but nevertheless something

01:10:45.500 --> 01:10:45.510
paradoxical but nevertheless something

paradoxical but nevertheless something
very valuable to point out is that folks

01:10:48.140 --> 01:10:48.150
very valuable to point out is that folks

very valuable to point out is that folks
will come out of out of this program

01:10:50.350 --> 01:10:50.360
will come out of out of this program

I'll have better preparation right that

01:10:53.720 --> 01:10:53.730
I'll have better preparation right that
 

01:10:53.730 --> 01:10:55.760
I'll have better preparation right that
at that moment of leaving the program if

01:10:55.760 --> 01:10:55.770
at that moment of leaving the program if

you are Art Caplan or Dan Callahan won't

really all three of you guys but a lot

01:11:02.359 --> 01:11:02.369
really all three of you guys but a lot
 

01:11:02.369 --> 01:11:04.490
really all three of you guys but a lot
of it a lot about about Greek philosophy

01:11:04.490 --> 01:11:04.500
of it a lot about about Greek philosophy
 

01:11:04.500 --> 01:11:07.250
of it a lot about about Greek philosophy
and everything else but so far as the

01:11:07.250 --> 01:11:07.260
and everything else but so far as the
 

01:11:07.260 --> 01:11:09.169
and everything else but so far as the
nitty-gritty of bioethics you learn that

01:11:09.169 --> 01:11:09.179
nitty-gritty of bioethics you learn that
 

01:11:09.179 --> 01:11:11.959
nitty-gritty of bioethics you learn that
in practice and I think there's over you

01:11:11.959 --> 01:11:11.969
in practice and I think there's over you
 

01:11:11.969 --> 01:11:14.959

got it head start on this that's it you
 

01:11:14.969 --> 01:11:18.979
got it head start on this that's it you
need also to to go beyond that just as

01:11:18.979 --> 01:11:18.989
need also to to go beyond that just as
 

01:11:18.989 --> 01:11:20.689
need also to to go beyond that just as
as we like Bianca

one other thing that's good if you want
 

01:11:22.320 --> 01:11:25.490
one other thing that's good if you want
a career in bioethics is if your your

01:11:25.490 --> 01:11:25.500
a career in bioethics is if your your
 

01:11:25.500 --> 01:11:29.180
a career in bioethics is if your your
name is Dan because they're actually

01:11:29.180 --> 01:11:29.190
name is Dan because they're actually
 

01:11:29.190 --> 01:11:31.250
name is Dan because they're actually
quite a few Dan's there's Dan wiggler

01:11:31.250 --> 01:11:31.260
quite a few Dan's there's Dan wiggler

Dan Houseman and I could go on very

01:11:48.730 --> 01:11:48.740
 
 

01:11:48.740 --> 01:12:02.500
 
I got there in 1969 when the new

01:12:02.500 --> 01:12:02.510
I got there in 1969 when the new
 

01:12:02.510 --> 01:12:35.100
I got there in 1969 when the new
curriculum started let me say it again

01:12:35.100 --> 01:12:35.110
 
 

01:12:35.110 --> 01:13:12.379
 
there's

01:13:12.379 --> 01:13:12.389
 
 

01:13:12.389 --> 01:13:14.760
 
one of the other interesting things

01:13:14.760 --> 01:13:14.770
one of the other interesting things
 

01:13:14.770 --> 01:13:20.550
one of the other interesting things
about access is that I think my

01:13:20.550 --> 01:13:20.560
about access is that I think my
 

01:13:20.560 --> 01:13:24.770
about access is that I think my
generation deserves some credit and

01:13:24.770 --> 01:13:24.780
generation deserves some credit and
 

01:13:24.780 --> 01:13:30.479
generation deserves some credit and
because when I first started doing some

01:13:30.479 --> 01:13:30.489
because when I first started doing some
 

01:13:30.489 --> 01:13:34.350
because when I first started doing some
of this physicians were extremely

01:13:34.350 --> 01:13:34.360
of this physicians were extremely
 

01:13:34.360 --> 01:13:36.479
of this physicians were extremely
skeptical about people like me being

01:13:36.479 --> 01:13:36.489
skeptical about people like me being
 

01:13:36.489 --> 01:13:40.890
skeptical about people like me being
involved in these issues and we really

01:13:40.890 --> 01:13:40.900
involved in these issues and we really
 

01:13:40.900 --> 01:13:43.200
involved in these issues and we really
had to work hard to earn credibility

01:13:43.200 --> 01:13:43.210
had to work hard to earn credibility
 

01:13:43.210 --> 01:13:44.729
had to work hard to earn credibility
that was why I think it was very

01:13:44.729 --> 01:13:44.739
that was why I think it was very
 

01:13:44.739 --> 01:13:47.720
that was why I think it was very
important for me to have that

01:13:47.720 --> 01:13:47.730
important for me to have that
 

01:13:47.730 --> 01:13:50.490
important for me to have that

beginning when I came into this field as
 

01:14:10.600 --> 01:14:12.510
beginning when I came into this field as
I mentioned before ethics committees

01:14:12.510 --> 01:14:12.520
I mentioned before ethics committees
 

01:14:12.520 --> 01:14:17.760

didn't exist at all any place and so it

01:14:17.760 --> 01:14:17.770
didn't exist at all any place and so it

didn't exist at all any place and so it
was peculiar to have non clinicians

01:14:22.169 --> 01:14:22.179
was peculiar to have non clinicians
 

01:14:22.179 --> 01:14:25.550
was peculiar to have non clinicians
around in these settings and so I think

01:14:25.550 --> 01:14:25.560
around in these settings and so I think
 

01:14:25.560 --> 01:14:28.320
around in these settings and so I think
you're right a lot of it is access but I

01:14:28.320 --> 01:14:28.330
you're right a lot of it is access but I
 

01:14:28.330 --> 01:14:30.720
you're right a lot of it is access but I
think the access is a lot easier

01:14:30.720 --> 01:14:30.730
think the access is a lot easier
 

01:14:30.730 --> 01:14:36.270
think the access is a lot easier
nowadays because a lot of physicians now

01:14:36.270 --> 01:14:36.280
nowadays because a lot of physicians now
 

01:14:36.280 --> 01:14:39.030

the concerns they have in some ways may

01:14:45.419 --> 01:14:45.429
the concerns they have in some ways may
 

01:14:45.429 --> 01:14:48.090
the concerns they have in some ways may
help them and make their job easier so

01:14:48.090 --> 01:14:48.100
help them and make their job easier so
 

01:14:48.100 --> 01:14:51.870
help them and make their job easier so
it the access is this partly just power

01:14:51.870 --> 01:14:51.880
it the access is this partly just power
 

01:14:51.880 --> 01:14:55.129
it the access is this partly just power
and credentials but it's also a

01:14:55.129 --> 01:14:55.139
and credentials but it's also a
 

01:14:55.139 --> 01:14:57.330

recognition that this is an

01:14:57.330 --> 01:14:57.340
recognition that this is an
 

01:14:57.340 --> 01:15:01.590
recognition that this is an
interdisciplinary field and you can get

01:15:01.590 --> 01:15:01.600
interdisciplinary field and you can get
 

01:15:01.600 --> 01:15:03.629
interdisciplinary field and you can get
different contributions from different

01:15:03.629 --> 01:15:03.639
different contributions from different
 

01:15:03.639 --> 01:15:06.209

work in these areas have a lot to
contribute and obviously the physicians
