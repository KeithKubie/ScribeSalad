MARISSA GIUSTINA:
Quantum computing--

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:11.140
it's been all over
the news lately, often

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:12.970
accompanied by an
air of mystique

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:15.220
or an assortment of
fantastic promises.

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:17.590
But what does "quantum"
mean in the context

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:19.090
of computer hardware?

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:22.270
What distinguishes a quantum
computer from a regular one?

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:23.950
What does a quantum
computer look like?

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:25.090
How do we build it?

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:27.040
My name is Marissa
Giustina, and I'm

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:30.640
a research scientist in the
Google AI Quantum Hardware Lab.

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.259
I'd like to unpack
those questions.

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:34.310
And hopefully, in
about five minutes,

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:37.060
the term "quantum computer" will
have just a little more meaning

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:37.930
for you.

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:40.900
We're working to build devices
that we can interact with.

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:44.290
That is, devices we can
control and read out,

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:47.960
which behave reliably according
to a simple quantum model.

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.130
In other words, we're building
quantum computing hardware.

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:52.960
Quantum hardware can
be used as a tool

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.210
for approaching certain kinds
of computational problems.

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:59.530
So our ongoing efforts are
both to develop the hardware

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:03.490
and to develop algorithms
that leverage this hardware.

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:05.470
Let's start with
the first question.

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:09.070
What does it mean for
hardware to be quantum?

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:12.400
For that, we'll talk for a
moment about quantum mechanics.

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.734
A model is the physicist's
tool to make predictions

00:01:14.734 --> 00:01:16.150
about what will
happen when we put

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:18.310
the universe into a
certain configuration

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:20.000
and poke it in a certain way.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.990
For example, if you'd never
built a skyscraper before,

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:25.570
you might make a Lego version
before building it full scale.

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:27.190
That's a model.

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:30.460
Models can also be expressed
in the language of mathematics.

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:32.980
The most fundamental
model of nature we know

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:34.960
was developed in the
early 20th century

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:37.600
and is known as
quantum mechanics.

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.720
The word "mechanics"
refers to the mechanisms

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:42.340
by which things happen.

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:45.940
The word "quantum" refers
to discrete quantities

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:48.610
of energy or some other
physical quantity.

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:51.850
Within quantum mechanics,
energy comes in packets,

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:53.560
sometimes called photons.

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.710
And you cannot have
fractional packets.

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:58.960
So what's a quantum object?

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.240
People sometimes think of a
quantum object as being tiny

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.270
and a quantum leap
as being large.

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:06.070
However the word
"quantum" doesn't

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:07.930
dictate an object's size.

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:09.910
Actually, a quantum
object is one

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:12.010
that relates in a
well-defined way

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:14.350
to a single quantum of energy.

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:17.260
For instance, the photon I
mentioned before is a quantum

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:18.070
object.

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:21.620
A photon is a single
particle of energy.

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.250
Similarly, atoms
are quantum objects.

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:26.770
An electron flying
around an atomic nucleus

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:28.900
may be excited
into a higher orbit

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.189
only by a particular
quantum of energy.

00:02:31.189 --> 00:02:32.980
There is no halfway
point between the lower

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:34.660
orbit and the upper orbit.

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:36.880
If the wrong energy is
provided, there simply

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:40.000
isn't a corresponding orbit
for the electron to land in.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.270
In a nutshell, a quantum
object is one whose observable

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:46.360
behavior reflects that
nature only offers

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.520
energy in discrete packets.

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:51.490
Now onto the next question.

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:53.680
What differentiates
quantum computing hardware

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.170
from a regular computer?

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:58.090
In essence, quantum
hardware lives

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:01.090
in a richer world than its
conventional counterpart.

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:03.980
Let's consider a simple,
abstract, quantum object,

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:05.920
which is entirely
described by the fact

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:08.870
that it can be in one of
two different energy levels.

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:11.900
Let's call those levels 0 and 1.

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.170
You can interpret those
brackets around the 0

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:17.290
to mean this is a quantum
energy level called "0."

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:18.940
And likewise for the "1."

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:23.800
Here, for example is a quantum
energy state named "psi."

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:26.860
Recall the classical bit of
information, a switch that

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:28.370
can take one of two values--

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:29.770
0 and 1.

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:32.050
Because of the apparent
similarity between our quantum

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:34.460
object and that classical
bit of information,

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:37.720
we call this quantum analog
a quantum bit, or qubit.

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:39.910
One peculiar feature
about quantum mechanics

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:42.150
is the existence
of superpositions.

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:44.230
A superposition is
like a special mixture

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:47.860
of the energy levels 0 and 1,
where the weight of each energy

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:52.450
level is given by complex
constants C0 and C1.

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:54.370
If we measure the
energy of our qubit,

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:58.030
we will sometimes observe
0, and sometimes 1,

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:01.510
where the value of sometimes
is given by the constants.

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:04.690
An individual measurement will
yield an outcome of 0 or 1.

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:06.370
There are no other options.

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:08.590
But before the
measurement occurs,

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:10.840
we know at most the chances
of getting a 0 or a 1.

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:14.500
We can't know the actual outcome
for sure until we measure it.

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:17.140
Therefore, when we want
to talk about the energy

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:19.540
state of the qubit before
we've made the measurement,

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:22.600
we use this superposition to
represent that the qubit hasn't

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:24.520
decided yet which
outcome to display,

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:28.390
even though the chances of
getting each outcome are fixed.

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:30.670
Now, even admitting that
this superposition business

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:32.140
is a little unusual.

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:34.630
We can accept that it's easy
enough to represent one qubit.

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:36.850
We just wrote it
down right there.

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:40.030
Thinking about more qubits
gets increasingly difficult.

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:42.100
Suppose we add a second qubit.

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:43.600
If these were
conventional switches,

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:45.670
we could think about each
switch independently.

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:47.080
But qubits are different.

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:49.910
Just as one qubit can be
in a superposition state,

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:52.357
two qubits can share
a superposition state,

00:04:52.357 --> 00:04:54.190
where, for instance,
the measurement outcome

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:57.250
is unknown, but will certainly
be the same for both objects--

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:59.540
or opposite for both objects.

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:01.390
For example, here's
a state where

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:04.180
a blue qubit and a
yellow qubit are together

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:06.520
in a superposition state.

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:08.867
Here, they're correlated
to each other.

00:05:08.867 --> 00:05:10.950
Before the measurement,
it cannot be known whether

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:13.770
the blue qubit will
turn up 0 or 1.

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:16.800
But a measurement of both qubits
will certainly always give

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:19.110
the same answer for each.

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:21.780
Similarly, in this case,
measuring the blue and yellow

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:24.900
qubits will always
give opposite outcomes.

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:27.750
This means that in order to
fully describe two qubits,

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:31.450
we need to consider C's for all
possible measurement outcomes

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:32.700
we could see.

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:35.760
To describe three qubits,
we need eight C's.

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:39.600
Describing four qubits
takes 16 C's, and so on.

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:41.340
Each time we add
another qubit, it

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:43.260
takes twice as much
information to describe

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:44.760
the whole pile of them.

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:46.770
That is the crux of
what differentiates

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:47.910
quantum hardware.

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:50.460
The quantum system
lives in a richer space,

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:53.220
so that representing n qubits
with a classical computer

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:55.690
requires 2 to the n numbers.

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:58.170
But does this mean that a
quantum memory with 100 qubits

00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:00.240
corresponds to a
conventional memory with 2

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:01.680
to the 100th bits?

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:03.390
Not so fast.

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:05.910
Quantum hardware is very
effective at encoding

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:08.580
and processing certain
kinds of information.

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:12.000
But it cannot efficiently mimic
many useful aspects of its

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:13.320
classical counterpart.

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:16.140
When we say that a picture
is worth 1,000 words,

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:19.530
we don't abolish words
entirely in favor of pictures.

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:22.710
Adding quantum hardware to our
modern computing capabilities

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:25.680
would be like adding pictures to
a communication strategy that,

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:28.240
up to now, used only words.

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:30.990
So what does quantum
hardware do well?

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:34.224
The exponentially growing
complexity of quantum systems

00:06:34.224 --> 00:06:36.390
also gives a clue about
where quantum hardware could

00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:37.650
be useful.

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:40.170
In the fields of chemistry
and materials development,

00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:42.660
simulation of molecules
could be a powerful technique

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:45.150
to learn about the
properties of a new molecule

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:47.800
before fully synthesizing
it in the lab.

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:50.430
However, our ability to
simulate chemistry on computers

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:51.960
is limited.

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:54.000
At its heart, chemistry
is an application

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:55.220
of quantum mechanics.

00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:57.420
And each electron
we add to a model

00:06:57.420 --> 00:07:00.030
doubles the number of
parameters, crippling computers

00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:01.740
with expensive
calculations already

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:03.810
for very small molecules.

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:06.660
Suppose instead that we could
build chemistry models out

00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:08.707
of a quantum Lego set.

00:07:08.707 --> 00:07:11.040
Then the model would be built
with the same physics that

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:13.140
governs the system
being modeled.

00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:16.020
In fact, chemistry and
materials simulations

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:18.240
have appeared as an
appealing near-term problem

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:20.370
to approach using
quantum hardware.

00:07:20.370 --> 00:07:22.590
We've finally reached
the last question.

00:07:22.590 --> 00:07:24.360
What does a quantum
computer look like,

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:26.194
and how do we build it?

00:07:26.194 --> 00:07:28.110
Let's take a quick look
at the actual hardware

00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:29.920
we're building at Google.

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:32.670
Our qubits are resonant
electrical circuits

00:07:32.670 --> 00:07:35.130
made of patterned
aluminum on a silicon chip

00:07:35.130 --> 00:07:37.560
that slosh electrical
current back and forth at two

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:40.860
different energy levels to
encode the quantum 0 and 1

00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:41.710
states.

00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:44.280
Here's an example of one
of our quantum chips.

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:46.590
Each chip features 72 qubits.

00:07:46.590 --> 00:07:49.140
As you can see, it's about
the size of a quarter.

00:07:49.140 --> 00:07:52.470
We want each qubit to behave
as one single quantum object,

00:07:52.470 --> 00:07:53.910
with two levels.

00:07:53.910 --> 00:07:55.860
Any other particle
interacting with a qubit

00:07:55.860 --> 00:07:59.070
from its environment pulls it
away from this two-level ideal.

00:07:59.070 --> 00:08:00.870
So creating a clean
qubit environment

00:08:00.870 --> 00:08:02.760
is a critical challenge.

00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:05.190
At the same time, we want
to be able to control

00:08:05.190 --> 00:08:08.850
the qubits efficiently, adding
and removing quanta of energy

00:08:08.850 --> 00:08:10.440
and letting pairs
of qubits interact

00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:13.560
to exchange energy with
each other on demand.

00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:15.660
These requirements seem
to oppose each other.

00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:19.332
Ideal qubits should be perfectly
clean to interact with nothing.

00:08:19.332 --> 00:08:20.790
But then in specific
cases, we want

00:08:20.790 --> 00:08:22.890
them to interact very strongly.

00:08:22.890 --> 00:08:25.200
This gives one insight into
the tensions and challenges

00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:27.810
of building good
quantum hardware.

00:08:27.810 --> 00:08:30.360
A first step toward
building clean qubits

00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:31.920
is to build the
qubit circuits out

00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:33.570
of superconducting
materials, which

00:08:33.570 --> 00:08:36.270
experience no electrical loss.

00:08:36.270 --> 00:08:39.780
Superconductors perform only
at very low temperatures.

00:08:39.780 --> 00:08:41.730
And we operate our
qubits in a cryostat

00:08:41.730 --> 00:08:43.440
at less than 50
millikelvin, just

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:46.290
a fraction of a degree
above absolute zero.

00:08:46.290 --> 00:08:48.960
The cold temperatures and
vacuum inside a cryostat

00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:52.890
also contribute to keeping
the qubit environment clean.

00:08:52.890 --> 00:08:54.660
The cryostat
consists of a series

00:08:54.660 --> 00:08:56.400
of nested plates and cans.

00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:58.650
The warmest stage is at
the top, and it gets colder

00:08:58.650 --> 00:09:00.150
as you go down.

00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:02.460
All the equipment in the
central core of the cryostat

00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:04.770
is responsible for
getting things cold.

00:09:04.770 --> 00:09:06.750
Our hardware is installed
around the edges

00:09:06.750 --> 00:09:09.210
and on the bottom,
coldest plate.

00:09:09.210 --> 00:09:12.180
Each qubit chip must be
mounted in a package, which

00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:14.550
holds the chip at millikelvin
temperatures and bridges

00:09:14.550 --> 00:09:17.880
the gap between big
cables and a small chip.

00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:20.310
To address the packaged
chip, electronics

00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:22.230
outside the cryostat
send signals

00:09:22.230 --> 00:09:24.390
through cables in the cryostat.

00:09:24.390 --> 00:09:27.450
Each cable must carry electrical
signals from room temperature

00:09:27.450 --> 00:09:29.370
all the way down to
the coldest stage,

00:09:29.370 --> 00:09:31.617
while leaking only the
smallest amount of heat.

00:09:31.617 --> 00:09:33.450
A large heat load would
prevent the cryostat

00:09:33.450 --> 00:09:36.360
from reaching its
millikelvin base temperature.

00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:38.130
A collection of
filters and amplifiers

00:09:38.130 --> 00:09:41.920
outfits each cable
for its specific task.

00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:43.860
The electronics
outside the cryostat

00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:46.380
are controlled by code
running on a computer.

00:09:46.380 --> 00:09:49.530
They generate precisely
calibrated electrical signals,

00:09:49.530 --> 00:09:52.200
shaped pulses of
microwave radiation, which

00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:55.110
are sent to control and
read out the qubits.

00:09:55.110 --> 00:09:59.280
This entire system-- from chip
to cryostat, cables to code--

00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:01.952
is all necessary to run
our quantum hardware.

00:10:01.952 --> 00:10:04.410
I hope you have enjoyed digging
into some quantum computing

00:10:04.410 --> 00:10:06.456
basics with me in
these last few minutes.

00:10:06.456 --> 00:10:08.080
We talked about the
meaning of the word

00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:11.470
"quantum," in particular, as it
relates to computer hardware.

00:10:11.470 --> 00:10:14.140
Considering the idea of a
single qubit in superposition,

00:10:14.140 --> 00:10:16.510
and then adding more qubits,
we saw that each time we

00:10:16.510 --> 00:10:18.940
add another qubit, it takes
twice as much information

00:10:18.940 --> 00:10:20.745
to describe the
whole pile of them.

00:10:20.745 --> 00:10:22.870
That's what really
distinguishes a quantum computer

00:10:22.870 --> 00:10:24.490
from a regular one.

00:10:24.490 --> 00:10:26.530
Finally, I hope you
enjoyed the quick lab tour

00:10:26.530 --> 00:10:29.096
to get a basic sense of what
our quantum computer looks like,

00:10:29.096 --> 00:10:30.970
and what technology
we're developing in order

00:10:30.970 --> 00:10:32.200
to build it.

00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:34.471
Hopefully, the words
"quantum computer"

00:10:34.471 --> 00:10:36.220
now have just a little
more meaning to you

00:10:36.220 --> 00:10:37.990
than they did five minutes ago.

00:10:37.990 --> 00:10:40.560
For more detailed information
about how we make and program

00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:42.430
are quantum processors,
