00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:04.250
MALE SPEAKER: Today with
us is George Friedman,

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:08.290
an American political scientist,
author, and entrepreneur.

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:12.710
His newest book is "Flash
Points-- The Emerging Crisis

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:15.360
in Europe."

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.190
Mr. Friedman was born in
1949 in Budapest, Hungary.

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:23.280
He has authored several
books, including "The Next 100

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:25.450
Years," "The Next
Decade," "America's

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:28.440
Secret War," "The Intelligence
Edge," "The Coming

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:31.380
War with Japan," and
"The Future of War."

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.040
His newest, about which we'll
talk today, "Flash Points,"

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.215
talks about the emerging
crisis in Europe,

00:00:38.215 --> 00:00:40.660
and was published by Doubleday.

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:43.320
Mr. Freedman's childhood
was shaped directly

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.940
by international conflict.

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.390
He was born in Hungary
to Jewish parents

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:49.350
who survived the Holocaust.

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.630
His family fled Hungary
when he was a child

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:54.570
to escape the communist
regime, settling first

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.360
in a camp for displaced
persons in Austria,

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.610
and then emigrating
to the United States.

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:03.320
Mr. Friedman received a BA at
the City College of New York,

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:05.840
where he majored in
political science,

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.480
and a Ph.D. In government
at Cornell University.

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:11.290
Prior to joining
the private sector,

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:14.520
Mr. Friedman spent almost
20 years in academia,

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.760
teaching political science
at Dickinson College.

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:21.710
Mr. Friedman is the founder and
CEO of the Private Geopolitical

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:25.110
Forecasting and Intelligence
Corporation, Stratfor.

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.540
Please welcome Mr.
Friedman to Google.

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:29.496
Thank you.

00:01:29.496 --> 00:01:32.364
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:38.715 --> 00:01:41.090
GEORGE FRIEDMAN: Well, I am
pleased to be here at the one

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.860
company that Siemens
is worried about.

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:45.360
Google.

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.460
And actually that plays
a role in the story

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.440
that I'll tell here.

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:53.400
And you play a part.

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:57.190
So all talks on books should
begin with a justification

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:59.070
for writing yet
another book, where

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.630
there's millions
already written.

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:06.280
I had two reasons for wanting
to write this book directly.

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:10.789
The first, I've written a book
called "The Next 100 Years,"

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:15.620
which had forecast the
failure of the European Union.

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:22.246
The events that we see in
Ukraine now, things of that

00:02:22.246 --> 00:02:24.530
sort.

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.090
These things are of
fundamental importance,

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:34.370
because Europe remains one of
the centers of world culture,

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:37.960
and it remains the single
largest economic region

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:41.470
of the world, larger
than the United States.

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:44.580
What happens in Europe
does not stay in Europe.

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:47.740
And if the European Union
is failing-- as I'm arguing

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:54.820
it does-- this has consequences
that will resonate for decades.

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:56.790
The second reason
I wrote this book

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:02.210
is quite personal, as
was just pointed out.

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:05.150
My life, and the
life of my family,

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:07.540
was bound up with the
geopolitics of Europe.

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:10.750
I have a chapter in there--
the second chapter-- that's

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:14.040
called "A European
Life." and it was

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:18.740
meant to say it was life of my
father, and to a lesser extent,

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:21.160
my mother.

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.530
And what I was
saying was that there

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:25.585
was nothing unique in this life.

00:03:25.585 --> 00:03:28.600
It was just a European life.

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:32.130
Those Europeans who lived
through the 20th century,

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:35.150
particularly the first
half, were either

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:38.540
uniquely fortunate
to live through it,

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:41.790
or uniquely cunning, or both.

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:44.380
But a European life
collided with European

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:51.530
geopolitics over and over
again to create catastrophe.

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:56.550
My parents were born
just before World War I.

00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:01.000
And in that war, their
fathers, brothers

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.660
fought on the Turkish
front, mostly,

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:06.820
because they were Hungarians.

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:08.870
And after the war,
the borders shifted,

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:12.430
and the places they were born
became part of other countries.

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:15.410
And they moved to
Budapest where they met,

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:18.800
and they fell in love,
and they married, and had

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:22.400
a daughter-- my older
sister-- and made a living.

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:25.540
They tried to live
an ordinary life.

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:30.620
And then European geopolitics
shifted again in the '30s.

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:34.020
And Germany became the
rising power again.

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:38.190
And suddenly my parents became
national security threats

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:39.580
to the German state.

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:41.820
They were Jews.

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:46.760
My father was forced
into the Hungarian army,

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:49.610
into a Jewish labor battalion.

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:54.690
And he went to just
north of Stalingrad

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:58.950
in 1942, to a city
called Voronezh.

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:03.240
And that was exactly the
point where the Soviets staged

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:09.510
their counterattack against
the German Sixth Army.

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:14.520
My father then walked back
in the winter of '42, '43,

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:16.000
to Budapest.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.040
A distance of a thousand miles
through a bitter cold winter,

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:22.630
poorly clothed.

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:27.130
He survived where almost
everybody else in his unit

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:32.415
died, partly by the fact
that he was a tough man,

00:05:32.415 --> 00:05:35.620
and partly by the fact
that he was a smart man,

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:39.190
but overwhelmingly because
he was a lucky man.

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:41.880
Because that's all
that really mattered.

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:44.270
He went back to Budapest.

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:46.890
And then for a year or
so, he was able to live.

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:49.436
The Germans had not
yet occupied Hungary.

00:05:49.436 --> 00:05:50.810
And then the
Germans decided they

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:57.130
had to occupy Hungary because
Horthy, the leader of Hungary,

00:05:57.130 --> 00:05:59.570
was making a deal
with the Russians.

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:04.170
And they sent my father and my
mother to concentration camps.

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:09.950
My sister at the age of five was
left alone in a Swiss shelter

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:12.422
to survive how she could.

00:06:12.422 --> 00:06:14.130
There was nothing
unique about this life.

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:17.404
Everybody, Christian,
Jew, whatever,

00:06:17.404 --> 00:06:18.320
suffered through this.

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:21.590
It should not be taken as a
unique story of my family.

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:24.540
It was a unique story of Europe.

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:27.980
And then the communists came.

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:30.320
They survived, they came back.

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:34.290
And the Soviet army
occupied Hungary.

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:39.710
And my uncle, who was a
member of the Communist Party,

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:44.860
and part of the Secret Police,
let my father know shortly

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:47.580
in 1948, that he was on a list.

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:50.710
He had been a member of the
Social Democratic Party.

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:54.020
The Communists hated
the Social Democrats.

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:55.389
And he was on a list.

00:06:55.389 --> 00:06:56.930
And this was a time
and a place where

00:06:56.930 --> 00:07:00.000
you should not be on any list.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.290
And so my parents face
an existential choice--

00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:09.350
stay and perhaps die at the
hands of the Secret Police,

00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:12.390
or try to escape.

00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:17.350
And so in one night in August,
the family went to a point

00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:21.900
on the Czechoslovakian
border, on the Danube,

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:25.010
and we got into a rubber raft
and went across the river.

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:31.570
I'm told that searchlights
were playing on the river,

00:07:31.570 --> 00:07:34.590
and machine guns were
in search towers.

00:07:34.590 --> 00:07:39.580
And it was just luck that the
searchlights didn't find us.

00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:42.530
And I was, of course,
asleep, drugged,

00:07:42.530 --> 00:07:45.460
because I was a danger
to the entire operation.

00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:48.260
Why did we go to Czechoslovakia?

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:50.430
Because, again of geopolitics.

00:07:50.430 --> 00:07:53.160
The British had lost Palestine.

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:55.690
The Israeli State
had been established.

00:07:55.690 --> 00:07:57.870
And the Russians
wanted to do anything

00:07:57.870 --> 00:08:00.170
to undermine the British.

00:08:00.170 --> 00:08:04.150
And they were hoping they could
form an alliance with Israel,

00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:06.530
and make Israel
a kind of toehold

00:08:06.530 --> 00:08:08.845
for the Communists
on the Mediterranean.

00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:13.760
The Israelis needed two things.

00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:14.690
One was weapons.

00:08:14.690 --> 00:08:17.790
The other were Jews.

00:08:17.790 --> 00:08:20.100
The Soviets had both.

00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:24.070
And they routed these weapons
through Czechoslovakia.

00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:28.340
And they routed these Jews
through Czechoslovakia.

00:08:28.340 --> 00:08:33.450
And from there they were
taken to a port, Trieste,

00:08:33.450 --> 00:08:36.320
where they were
shipped to Israel.

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:40.720
And my parents sought to hookup
with these Israeli smugglers,

00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:44.120
which they did in the
town of [INAUDIBLE].

00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:46.940
Now my father had no desire
to go to the United States.

00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:48.430
He was a deeply
committed Zionist,

00:08:48.430 --> 00:08:51.000
but he wanted nothing
to do with Israel.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.550
The paradox was that he
had spent his life trying

00:08:54.550 --> 00:08:57.540
to stay alive in the face
of people who believe deeply

00:08:57.540 --> 00:08:58.810
in things.

00:08:58.810 --> 00:09:00.560
And he did not want
to go to another place

00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:03.230
where people believe
deeply in things,

00:09:03.230 --> 00:09:05.490
and might take his
life on either side.

00:09:05.490 --> 00:09:07.850
Or as he said, I wasn't going
to go to the Negev Desert

00:09:07.850 --> 00:09:10.180
with two hand grenades
and start again.

00:09:10.180 --> 00:09:13.300
I had had enough of this.

00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:17.530
And so my father
sought to go to a place

00:09:17.530 --> 00:09:19.769
that-- he had two requirements.

00:09:19.769 --> 00:09:21.935
First, it should be stronger
than all its neighbors.

00:09:24.470 --> 00:09:26.760
And secondly, no
one should believe

00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:30.276
in anything nearly strongly
enough to kill him.

00:09:30.276 --> 00:09:33.726
He had very low standards.

00:09:33.726 --> 00:09:35.600
He didn't want to go to
Canada because Canada

00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:38.380
was a weak country, and
America was a strong country,

00:09:38.380 --> 00:09:41.060
and who knows what would happen.

00:09:41.060 --> 00:09:42.370
Reasoning like that.

00:09:42.370 --> 00:09:44.970
He wanted to go to
the United States.

00:09:44.970 --> 00:09:48.940
To go to the United
States was complex.

00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:51.900
But somewhere in this
my father made a deal

00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:54.430
where my mother,
my sister, and I

00:09:54.430 --> 00:09:56.380
were allowed to go
to the United States

00:09:56.380 --> 00:09:58.780
and become citizens
very quickly.

00:09:58.780 --> 00:10:00.940
My father stayed behind.

00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:04.090
This was a time when the Cold
War was beginning-- or had

00:10:04.090 --> 00:10:06.500
actually gotten fairly intense.

00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:08.340
And the Americans
who had no idea what

00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:11.060
was going on the other
side of the Iron Curtain

00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:13.920
were recruiting anyone who
even spoke the language.

00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:15.840
My father did speak
Hungarian, and that

00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:19.560
was enough to be recruited.

00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:21.420
They also recruited
many Soviet agents,

00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:23.240
so it was a complete disaster.

00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:26.800
The CIA at its best.

00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:31.040
And then eventually my father
came to the United States.

00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:33.910
In United States we grew
up in the Bronx, which

00:10:33.910 --> 00:10:39.220
was a tough neighborhood,
but not as bad as it became.

00:10:39.220 --> 00:10:41.320
And then we moved to
Queens to a little house.

00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:42.540
And he loved this house.

00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:45.410
And my mother loved the house.

00:10:45.410 --> 00:10:46.650
And it had a little garden.

00:10:46.650 --> 00:10:49.930
And one day my father
heard me playing somebody

00:10:49.930 --> 00:10:55.230
called Pete Seeger
on the record player.

00:10:55.230 --> 00:10:56.810
And Pete Seeger
was a folk singer

00:10:56.810 --> 00:11:00.480
who spoke about little
houses made of ticky tacky

00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:04.480
and the corruption
of suburban life.

00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:06.150
My father asked me
what he was saying.

00:11:06.150 --> 00:11:12.000
And I said, well he
was saying that people

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:16.790
who live in suburban
houses that look alike

00:11:16.790 --> 00:11:20.320
are losing their identities.

00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:22.040
The house is their identity.

00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:23.850
They are the house.

00:11:23.850 --> 00:11:30.440
And when everything looks
alike, you have become ants.

00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:32.450
There's no difference.

00:11:32.450 --> 00:11:34.037
And my father said
to me-- I'll never

00:11:34.037 --> 00:11:35.870
forget-- this is what
Americans worry about?

00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:41.220
And what he meant
by that was, look,

00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:43.770
I'm not worried about
losing my identity.

00:11:43.770 --> 00:11:46.580
I'm worried about
losing my life.

00:11:46.580 --> 00:11:49.440
If I don't have to worry
about my dying, my wife dying,

00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:52.860
my children dying-- I'm happy.

00:11:52.860 --> 00:11:55.312
My identity doesn't
depend on the house.

00:11:55.312 --> 00:11:57.270
And frankly, I'm not
worried about my identity.

00:11:57.270 --> 00:11:59.964
I know who I am.

00:11:59.964 --> 00:12:01.880
I explained, look, when
you live in the United

00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:05.330
States-- a very rich country,
a very powerful country,

00:12:05.330 --> 00:12:12.550
a country that's almost
invulnerable-- you

00:12:12.550 --> 00:12:15.010
worry about these things.

00:12:15.010 --> 00:12:18.601
When you come from Hungary in
the middle of the 20th century,

00:12:18.601 --> 00:12:19.350
you don't have to.

00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:26.640
My father said
something else to me.

00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:31.290
Every American student
wants to go to Europe.

00:12:31.290 --> 00:12:32.730
And I went to Europe.

00:12:32.730 --> 00:12:34.350
And I said to my
father, why don't you

00:12:34.350 --> 00:12:37.500
come visit Europe with me?

00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:39.970
And his answer was, there's
nothing in Europe for me.

00:12:39.970 --> 00:12:42.820
I said, don't you want to
see where you were born?

00:12:42.820 --> 00:12:43.320
No.

00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:43.950
I hate them.

00:12:43.950 --> 00:12:45.370
And I said, look.

00:12:45.370 --> 00:12:48.090
They've changed.

00:12:48.090 --> 00:12:52.370
And he said to me, the
Europeans will never change.

00:12:52.370 --> 00:12:56.510
They only will pretend
it didn't happen.

00:12:56.510 --> 00:13:00.000
That's what the root cause
for me to write this book.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.050
The European Union
was an attempt

00:13:03.050 --> 00:13:11.860
to transform Europe from a
slaughterhouse into a place

00:13:11.860 --> 00:13:17.580
that had banished conflict,
that had banished poverty, that

00:13:17.580 --> 00:13:19.750
had banished all of
the bad impulses that

00:13:19.750 --> 00:13:22.900
were there before.

00:13:22.900 --> 00:13:26.500
It was a noble intention.

00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:28.950
But I had come to the
conclusion that the European

00:13:28.950 --> 00:13:31.050
Union was failing.

00:13:31.050 --> 00:13:36.230
And therefore the question
was, what comes next?

00:13:36.230 --> 00:13:39.665
If the European
Union doesn't work,

00:13:39.665 --> 00:13:43.450
are all of the
monsters and fears that

00:13:43.450 --> 00:13:46.970
existed before-- are they gone?

00:13:46.970 --> 00:13:49.900
And that really is
what the book is about.

00:13:49.900 --> 00:13:54.300
And it begins with
a paradox in Europe.

00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:56.790
Europe invented humanity.

00:13:56.790 --> 00:14:00.580
And by that I mean this--
before the European Age

00:14:00.580 --> 00:14:03.160
of Exploration,
the Mongolians had

00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:06.350
no idea there were Congolese.

00:14:06.350 --> 00:14:09.570
The Congolese had never
heard of the Aztecs.

00:14:09.570 --> 00:14:12.590
The Aztecs had never
heard of the Japanese.

00:14:12.590 --> 00:14:16.090
The Japanese have never
heard of the English.

00:14:16.090 --> 00:14:19.830
The world consisted of
separate little plants.

00:14:19.830 --> 00:14:22.260
There was no sense
of a common humanity.

00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:25.600
The idea that there is one
species throughout the world,

00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:27.960
and however different
they were, it

00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:30.290
wasn't that they knew they
were there and rejected

00:14:30.290 --> 00:14:31.599
their humanity.

00:14:31.599 --> 00:14:32.390
They hadn't a clue.

00:14:35.130 --> 00:14:40.750
For all its brutality, its
bloodshed, European imperialism

00:14:40.750 --> 00:14:45.100
achieved at least one thing.

00:14:45.100 --> 00:14:47.710
It discovered humanity.

00:14:47.710 --> 00:14:51.730
Humanity in the sense that
there is a single species,

00:14:51.730 --> 00:14:53.310
that we share things in common.

00:14:56.140 --> 00:14:59.340
And however much we
may hate each other,

00:14:59.340 --> 00:15:01.520
we hate each other as humans.

00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:04.280
This was an advance.

00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:06.530
But the Europeans did more.

00:15:06.530 --> 00:15:10.375
They transformed humanity's
relationship to nature.

00:15:13.910 --> 00:15:19.550
To me, the vision that
I have is the movies

00:15:19.550 --> 00:15:26.837
where in pre-World War I
days, a concert is held.

00:15:26.837 --> 00:15:27.670
It's a wintry night.

00:15:27.670 --> 00:15:29.400
And it's dark.

00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:33.640
And inside that room,
might has been banished,

00:15:33.640 --> 00:15:35.060
and the winter it shut out.

00:15:37.630 --> 00:15:44.080
And elegant men and women come
together to listen to Mozart.

00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:47.380
Now from my point of view, any
culture that can create Mozart

00:15:47.380 --> 00:15:49.590
is forgiven many things.

00:15:49.590 --> 00:15:53.270
You have to accept that.

00:15:53.270 --> 00:15:56.610
But it was this
huge transformation

00:15:56.610 --> 00:15:58.470
of man's relationship to time.

00:16:01.470 --> 00:16:07.070
A train could travel at 40
miles an hour, 50 miles an hour.

00:16:07.070 --> 00:16:11.870
A boat could go from London
to New York in a week.

00:16:11.870 --> 00:16:15.270
This was even before
the age of aircraft.

00:16:15.270 --> 00:16:17.717
The entire shape of the
planet, our understanding

00:16:17.717 --> 00:16:20.050
of what was possible, had
been changed by the Europeans.

00:16:23.250 --> 00:16:27.920
Europe had conquered
the world, and also it,

00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:31.280
in a very real sense,
conquered nature.

00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:32.650
Perfectly, no.

00:16:32.650 --> 00:16:38.980
But overwhelmingly redefined
how we experience life.

00:16:38.980 --> 00:16:43.090
The paradox is that Europe
never conquered itself.

00:16:43.090 --> 00:16:52.660
Throughout the 500 years from
1492 to 1992 of European power,

00:16:52.660 --> 00:16:56.350
no one was able to convince
the Europeans to unite

00:16:56.350 --> 00:16:58.530
in a single entity.

00:16:58.530 --> 00:17:01.180
And no one could
conquer them all.

00:17:01.180 --> 00:17:03.240
The Spanish tried.

00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:04.804
The French tried.

00:17:04.804 --> 00:17:07.079
The Germans tried.

00:17:07.079 --> 00:17:09.210
The English tried
half-heartedly.

00:17:09.210 --> 00:17:12.420
Even the Dutch took a shot.

00:17:12.420 --> 00:17:15.910
But the point is that
Europe was unconquerable.

00:17:15.910 --> 00:17:20.660
Europe is peninsulas
jutting out from peninsulas,

00:17:20.660 --> 00:17:25.530
mountains like the Alps, or the
Pyrenees, that can't be passed,

00:17:25.530 --> 00:17:27.930
the Baltic Sea
separating part of it,

00:17:27.930 --> 00:17:32.020
and the vast steppes of Russia.

00:17:32.020 --> 00:17:33.670
Napoleon came the closest.

00:17:33.670 --> 00:17:34.860
Hitler then came close.

00:17:34.860 --> 00:17:39.370
Both of them died in the
wastelands of Russia.

00:17:39.370 --> 00:17:40.750
Europe could not be united.

00:17:40.750 --> 00:17:43.560
So you had this paradox.

00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:51.350
This entity that conquered the
world could not conquer itself.

00:17:51.350 --> 00:17:52.910
It conquered the
world, yet there

00:17:52.910 --> 00:17:56.640
was an ongoing
civil war in Europe.

00:17:56.640 --> 00:17:59.510
But the feeling was,
it'll be alright.

00:18:02.410 --> 00:18:04.870
There was a man called
Norman Angell, who

00:18:04.870 --> 00:18:07.810
wrote a book called
"The Great illusion."

00:18:07.810 --> 00:18:09.020
He won the Nobel Prize later.

00:18:09.020 --> 00:18:10.420
He was a brilliant man.

00:18:10.420 --> 00:18:13.460
And he demonstrated in
1910 that it was impossible

00:18:13.460 --> 00:18:16.380
for there to be a war in Europe.

00:18:16.380 --> 00:18:18.730
There could not
be a war in Europe

00:18:18.730 --> 00:18:23.300
because the financial
system was so leveraged

00:18:23.300 --> 00:18:26.590
that it would cause
financial disaster.

00:18:26.590 --> 00:18:29.670
International
trade was critical.

00:18:29.670 --> 00:18:33.410
Interdependence reigned.

00:18:33.410 --> 00:18:35.650
So there could be no war.

00:18:35.650 --> 00:18:40.240
What Angell didn't understand
is interdependence leads to war.

00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:43.330
Madagascar and Brazil are
not going to fight a war.

00:18:43.330 --> 00:18:45.900
They have no issues
between them.

00:18:45.900 --> 00:18:51.930
But France and Germany are
interlocked geographically,

00:18:51.930 --> 00:18:56.190
industrially,
commercially, financially.

00:18:56.190 --> 00:18:59.580
And the advantage of one is
the disadvantage of the other.

00:18:59.580 --> 00:19:04.270
And each lives in dread of the
other, not just of its armies.

00:19:04.270 --> 00:19:06.050
But that fact that
interdependence

00:19:06.050 --> 00:19:10.310
means that if he does this,
this will mean this to me,

00:19:10.310 --> 00:19:13.550
makes each one want
to control the other,

00:19:13.550 --> 00:19:16.050
each one want to
dread the other.

00:19:16.050 --> 00:19:18.680
Wars do not happen
between nations

00:19:18.680 --> 00:19:20.930
that are not interconnected.

00:19:20.930 --> 00:19:24.110
They happen when
there's interdependence.

00:19:24.110 --> 00:19:26.750
And the interdependence
of Europe by 1914

00:19:26.750 --> 00:19:28.700
had become profound.

00:19:28.700 --> 00:19:31.470
And all European
nations lived in terror

00:19:31.470 --> 00:19:34.800
of all other European nations.

00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:36.850
This is an important
story, because when

00:19:36.850 --> 00:19:39.040
we talk about the
European vision,

00:19:39.040 --> 00:19:42.690
that they will create an entity
so interdependent on each other

00:19:42.690 --> 00:19:45.590
it will make war
impossible, we really

00:19:45.590 --> 00:19:50.790
have to read Norman
Angell-- a brilliant man who

00:19:50.790 --> 00:19:54.066
proved with
mathematical precision

00:19:54.066 --> 00:19:55.440
that World War I
couldn't happen.

00:19:58.590 --> 00:20:00.980
He missed.

00:20:00.980 --> 00:20:02.740
He got the math right.

00:20:02.740 --> 00:20:08.110
What he missed was human
nature, that you fear the thing

00:20:08.110 --> 00:20:09.400
that you depend on the most.

00:20:12.310 --> 00:20:17.370
Europe was a glittering
place in 1913.

00:20:17.370 --> 00:20:20.199
It stood astride
the entire world.

00:20:20.199 --> 00:20:21.990
There was no part of
the world that had not

00:20:21.990 --> 00:20:25.910
been either occupied at one
time by them, still occupied

00:20:25.910 --> 00:20:29.540
by Europeans, or under
such heavy influence that

00:20:29.540 --> 00:20:31.795
may as well have been occupied.

00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:36.330
And there was no
reasonable person

00:20:36.330 --> 00:20:39.760
who could imagine what
was about to happen,

00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:47.370
because what began in 1941
was 100 years-- I'm sorry.

00:20:47.370 --> 00:20:52.520
31 years of hell, of
unbelievable slaughter

00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:53.183
between 1914--

00:20:53.183 --> 00:20:56.980
MALE SPEAKER: You went from
1913 and then you said, 1941.

00:20:56.980 --> 00:20:58.680
Did you mean to say 1913?

00:20:58.680 --> 00:21:03.010
GEORGE FRIEDMAN: I meant
to say from 1914 to 1945.

00:21:03.010 --> 00:21:05.200
Thank you.

00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:09.680
As I make these
mistakes, let me know.

00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:15.522
In those years
from 1914 to 1945,

00:21:15.522 --> 00:21:20.590
about 100 million Europeans
died of political causes.

00:21:20.590 --> 00:21:24.530
First World War,
Second World War,

00:21:24.530 --> 00:21:32.060
the starvations in Ukraine-- the
planned political starvations,

00:21:32.060 --> 00:21:35.100
the Russian Civil
War, the Spanish Civil

00:21:35.100 --> 00:21:40.030
War, the Holocaust,
and on and on and on.

00:21:40.030 --> 00:21:41.991
This was just in Europe.

00:21:41.991 --> 00:21:46.080
Europe was a continent there
was never more than about 500

00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:49.650
million people during this time.

00:21:49.650 --> 00:21:53.210
The population grew
back to cover it.

00:21:53.210 --> 00:21:55.805
But 100 million people died.

00:21:59.300 --> 00:22:04.030
That was far more than were
killed by Genghis Khan.

00:22:04.030 --> 00:22:06.245
But you expected
Genghis Khan to do that.

00:22:06.245 --> 00:22:09.140
That was what Genghis
Khan did for a living.

00:22:09.140 --> 00:22:11.360
He slaughtered people.

00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:13.740
But the idea that the
continent that had given you

00:22:13.740 --> 00:22:23.290
Mozart, and concert halls, and
Kant, and Rousseau-- this gem

00:22:23.290 --> 00:22:28.430
of civilization, that
it could turn on itself

00:22:28.430 --> 00:22:31.580
and create the hell that I
described my father and mother

00:22:31.580 --> 00:22:37.870
living through, and the rest
of Europe lived through,

00:22:37.870 --> 00:22:40.870
this was unprecedented.

00:22:40.870 --> 00:22:44.400
I know of no example
of any empire that

00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:48.690
so rapidly destroyed itself,
not because there were

00:22:48.690 --> 00:22:53.060
external forces, but
because internally it

00:22:53.060 --> 00:22:57.930
was so unstable
and so disorderly.

00:22:57.930 --> 00:23:01.850
At the end of these
31 years, in 1945,

00:23:01.850 --> 00:23:04.230
Europe was occupied territory.

00:23:04.230 --> 00:23:05.950
It had gone from
ruling the world

00:23:05.950 --> 00:23:08.260
to being occupied by the
Americans and the Soviets.

00:23:13.460 --> 00:23:20.320
From 1945 until 1992 and the
fall of the Soviet Union,

00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:21.920
it remained occupied.

00:23:21.920 --> 00:23:24.150
Then different things
to be in the East

00:23:24.150 --> 00:23:27.420
and occupied by the Soviets,
than to be in the West.

00:23:27.420 --> 00:23:34.750
But the essence of sovereignty
is decisions of war and peace.

00:23:34.750 --> 00:23:40.680
And from 1945 to 1992, the
decision of war and peace

00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:45.815
was not made in Berlin, or
Rome, or Paris, or London.

00:23:45.815 --> 00:23:49.540
It Was made in Moscow
and Washington.

00:23:49.540 --> 00:23:51.960
If there was going
to be a war, it

00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:54.510
would happen because
they wanted it to.

00:23:54.510 --> 00:23:56.400
I should point out
at this point how

00:23:56.400 --> 00:23:59.750
incredibly,
meticulously responsible

00:23:59.750 --> 00:24:03.960
the Soviets and the Americans
were during this period.

00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:07.260
In spite of many issues,
in spite of massive armies

00:24:07.260 --> 00:24:10.770
facing each other,
and nuclear weapons,

00:24:10.770 --> 00:24:13.340
these two countries
went out of their way

00:24:13.340 --> 00:24:17.880
to make certain that
war would not break out.

00:24:17.880 --> 00:24:20.030
Imagine nuclear
weapons in the hands

00:24:20.030 --> 00:24:27.039
of the European diplomats
of 1914, or 1939.

00:24:27.039 --> 00:24:28.955
It's interesting, because
when I go to Europe,

00:24:28.955 --> 00:24:32.250
I'm called a cowboy,
which really I'm not,

00:24:32.250 --> 00:24:34.960
because I'm European.

00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:38.000
But I've never met
a cowboy, either.

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:40.800
They think of Americans
as cowboys-- wild, woolly,

00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:42.660
and violent.

00:24:42.660 --> 00:24:46.400
But compared to what
the Europeans were,

00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:48.440
the Americans are pacifists.

00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:50.830
They just talk big.

00:24:50.830 --> 00:24:53.910
And this is an important
thing to remember,

00:24:53.910 --> 00:24:58.340
that the Europeans, when
left to their own devices,

00:24:58.340 --> 00:25:02.375
have historically for millennia,
been extraordinarily violent.

00:25:05.650 --> 00:25:08.880
In 1992, two things happened.

00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:12.050
The collapse of the Soviet
Union exactly 500 years

00:25:12.050 --> 00:25:15.490
after Columbus meant
that for the first time,

00:25:15.490 --> 00:25:19.760
no European power
was a global power.

00:25:19.760 --> 00:25:23.130
That was an extraordinary
change in human history.

00:25:23.130 --> 00:25:26.710
For the first time in
500 years, Europeans

00:25:26.710 --> 00:25:28.190
were not a global power.

00:25:28.190 --> 00:25:29.890
There was only one global power.

00:25:29.890 --> 00:25:33.560
It was the United States, and it
had no idea what it was doing.

00:25:33.560 --> 00:25:35.180
It didn't want to
be a global power.

00:25:35.180 --> 00:25:37.600
It didn't know it was
the only global power.

00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:40.400
And it had the maturity
of a 15-year-old.

00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:43.060
If you've ever seen a
15-year-old in the morning,

00:25:43.060 --> 00:25:45.900
they are totally self-confident
that they can do anything.

00:25:45.900 --> 00:25:47.637
They could fly a
plane if they have to.

00:25:47.637 --> 00:25:49.845
In the evening, their
girlfriend breaks up with them,

00:25:49.845 --> 00:25:52.440
and they're suicidal.

00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:54.590
They're bipolar by nature.

00:25:54.590 --> 00:25:58.080
As is the United
States, lost in this.

00:25:58.080 --> 00:26:06.140
But still the Europeans had
emerged with this vision

00:26:06.140 --> 00:26:10.250
that they had
entered a new truth.

00:26:10.250 --> 00:26:13.110
And that truth was
the European Union.

00:26:13.110 --> 00:26:17.330
And the European Union
was based on the idea

00:26:17.330 --> 00:26:20.770
that the Europeans had
learned their lesson.

00:26:20.770 --> 00:26:23.780
They understood
that war was bad.

00:26:23.780 --> 00:26:28.970
And they constructed something
that would be better.

00:26:28.970 --> 00:26:31.930
It's vital to understand that
the European Union was created

00:26:31.930 --> 00:26:35.770
by the United States,
not the Europeans.

00:26:35.770 --> 00:26:38.270
Back in the 1940s
and early '50s,

00:26:38.270 --> 00:26:42.130
it was the United States that
wanted an integrated Europe.

00:26:42.130 --> 00:26:44.620
The Europeans resisted.

00:26:44.620 --> 00:26:46.590
The United States wanted
an integrated Europe

00:26:46.590 --> 00:26:49.630
not because they
like the Europeans,

00:26:49.630 --> 00:26:52.650
but they wanted a
strong economic bulwark

00:26:52.650 --> 00:26:55.040
against the Soviet
Union, and they

00:26:55.040 --> 00:26:57.970
wanted lines who
could afford armies,

00:26:57.970 --> 00:27:00.660
and so they wanted integration.

00:27:00.660 --> 00:27:03.310
And when the idea of
integration was put forward,

00:27:03.310 --> 00:27:06.930
the French didn't want
to work with the Germans,

00:27:06.930 --> 00:27:09.180
the English didn't want
to work with the French,

00:27:09.180 --> 00:27:11.950
and nobody wanted to
work with the Italians.

00:27:11.950 --> 00:27:13.890
So you had this
fundamental problem.

00:27:16.660 --> 00:27:18.940
The first European
leader that accepted

00:27:18.940 --> 00:27:22.120
the idea of a European entity,
whatever it was called,

00:27:22.120 --> 00:27:24.270
was Charles de Gaulle.

00:27:24.270 --> 00:27:26.680
And he accepted it not for
the reason you might think.

00:27:26.680 --> 00:27:29.560
He accepted it because if
there was an integrated Europe,

00:27:29.560 --> 00:27:32.790
France would be a leading
power, in his mind.

00:27:32.790 --> 00:27:35.360
France could steer
this entity into being

00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:37.750
a counterweight to
the United States.

00:27:37.750 --> 00:27:40.917
And Europe could
return to history.

00:27:40.917 --> 00:27:41.750
That was the theory.

00:27:45.500 --> 00:27:49.850
Over time, the Europeans
adopted this idea.

00:27:49.850 --> 00:27:52.090
They first struggled against it.

00:27:52.090 --> 00:27:53.090
Then they adopted it.

00:27:53.090 --> 00:27:54.930
And there was two
European Unions.

00:27:54.930 --> 00:27:56.580
One was the outer seven.

00:27:56.580 --> 00:27:58.140
The other was the inner six.

00:27:58.140 --> 00:28:01.260
And it developed
onward until it became,

00:28:01.260 --> 00:28:04.880
in 1992-- the same year
the Soviet Union fell,

00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:07.670
the Maastricht Treaty
came into force.

00:28:07.670 --> 00:28:10.130
And the Maastricht Treaty
created the modern European

00:28:10.130 --> 00:28:11.400
Union.

00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:15.550
A free trade zone
with some countries

00:28:15.550 --> 00:28:19.810
sharing in a common currency
and a regulatory apparatus

00:28:19.810 --> 00:28:22.220
in Brussels.

00:28:22.220 --> 00:28:26.490
It was, according to it's
official doctrine, based

00:28:26.490 --> 00:28:32.100
on peace and prosperity,
not the pursuit

00:28:32.100 --> 00:28:36.660
of happiness, which is to say,
not the American principle

00:28:36.660 --> 00:28:38.710
that you're promised
nothing except the right

00:28:38.710 --> 00:28:41.190
to try to be happy.

00:28:41.190 --> 00:28:44.420
The Europeans
promised happiness.

00:28:44.420 --> 00:28:47.560
They had to, because
they were terrified

00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:49.720
of what would happen otherwise.

00:28:49.720 --> 00:28:52.940
So the question
then became, what

00:28:52.940 --> 00:28:55.930
happens if you can't
get prosperity?

00:28:55.930 --> 00:28:58.240
What happens to peace?

00:28:58.240 --> 00:29:02.290
But from 1992 to
2008, it was a period

00:29:02.290 --> 00:29:08.390
of extraordinary economic
prosperity in the world.

00:29:08.390 --> 00:29:12.760
And all of the flaws, all the
problems, embedded in Europe

00:29:12.760 --> 00:29:14.440
were hidden.

00:29:14.440 --> 00:29:17.540
You couldn't see them.

00:29:17.540 --> 00:29:23.550
Then in 2008, in seven weeks,
the world transformed itself.

00:29:23.550 --> 00:29:30.280
Between August 8, 2008,
and September 15, 2008.

00:29:30.280 --> 00:29:35.830
On August 8, 2008, the
Russians invaded Georgia.

00:29:35.830 --> 00:29:37.780
This did several things.

00:29:37.780 --> 00:29:41.860
One, it re-announced,
history may not be over.

00:29:41.860 --> 00:29:45.070
The Russians have
returned to history.

00:29:45.070 --> 00:29:48.960
Why did the Russians
invade Georgia?

00:29:48.960 --> 00:29:51.040
The United States
was busy staging,

00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:55.510
the Russians felt, orange
revolutions everywhere.

00:29:55.510 --> 00:29:57.080
One of them was in the Ukraine.

00:29:57.080 --> 00:30:00.100
And this bears what
is happening today.

00:30:00.100 --> 00:30:02.030
And the Russians felt
there's only one reason

00:30:02.030 --> 00:30:06.070
to stage a pro-Western
uprising in the Ukraine--

00:30:06.070 --> 00:30:10.552
you plan to seize the
Ukraine and attack Russia.

00:30:10.552 --> 00:30:12.010
At this time, the
United States was

00:30:12.010 --> 00:30:13.960
bogged down in Iraq
and Afghanistan.

00:30:13.960 --> 00:30:17.210
And that really
wasn't on their minds.

00:30:17.210 --> 00:30:19.120
But it was on the Russian minds.

00:30:19.120 --> 00:30:23.260
And the invasion of
Georgia was designed

00:30:23.260 --> 00:30:24.750
to deliver this
message-- Georgia

00:30:24.750 --> 00:30:27.410
was aligned with
the United States.

00:30:27.410 --> 00:30:30.045
This is what an American
guarantee is worth.

00:30:34.600 --> 00:30:38.500
And that message was not
for the Georgians alone,

00:30:38.500 --> 00:30:43.360
but was especially to the
Ukrainians, to the Kazaks,

00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:50.410
to the Azerbaijanis, we're
back and we reframed history.

00:30:50.410 --> 00:30:52.840
And suddenly the idea
of perpetual peace--

00:30:52.840 --> 00:30:55.400
which had never existed in
Europe because at the same time

00:30:55.400 --> 00:30:58.010
that Maastricht was
going on, 100,000 people

00:30:58.010 --> 00:31:01.210
died in Yugoslavia-- which
the Europeans explained

00:31:01.210 --> 00:31:02.690
as they always
explain the Balkans,

00:31:02.690 --> 00:31:04.720
it's not really Europe.

00:31:04.720 --> 00:31:06.300
But of course it is.

00:31:06.300 --> 00:31:10.730
And 40,000 people
died in the Caucasus

00:31:10.730 --> 00:31:13.750
during the war between
Azerbaijan and Armenia.

00:31:18.460 --> 00:31:23.600
War was nibbling at
the edges of Europe.

00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:26.570
And that war that we
talk about now starts.

00:31:26.570 --> 00:31:28.710
There.

00:31:28.710 --> 00:31:30.850
But the more critical
thing that happened,

00:31:30.850 --> 00:31:33.250
happened seven weeks later.

00:31:33.250 --> 00:31:36.030
Lehman Brothers collapsed.

00:31:36.030 --> 00:31:40.150
And with the collapse of Lehman
Brothers, a series of events

00:31:40.150 --> 00:31:44.130
unfolds that brings
us to today's crisis--

00:31:44.130 --> 00:31:48.490
this week's crisis,
Greeks I should say.

00:31:48.490 --> 00:31:51.690
For the United States, this
was the fourth crisis--

00:31:51.690 --> 00:31:54.280
a financial crisis--
since World War II.

00:31:54.280 --> 00:31:57.040
There was a municipal
bond crisis.

00:31:57.040 --> 00:32:00.610
There was the third
world debt crisis.

00:32:00.610 --> 00:32:02.610
There was the savings
and loan crisis.

00:32:02.610 --> 00:32:04.320
And now the subprime crisis.

00:32:04.320 --> 00:32:07.360
And the United States
knew how to handle this.

00:32:07.360 --> 00:32:11.100
The head of the Federal
Reserve Bank, the secretary

00:32:11.100 --> 00:32:16.210
of treasury, and eight
bankers got into a room--

00:32:16.210 --> 00:32:17.730
broke every law on
the books, there

00:32:17.730 --> 00:32:20.250
was no justification for
these people to be in a room

00:32:20.250 --> 00:32:23.250
together-- and made a deal.

00:32:23.250 --> 00:32:25.200
And there's a way that
Americans handle this.

00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:27.120
First, the financial
community behaves

00:32:27.120 --> 00:32:30.350
with absolute irresponsibility.

00:32:30.350 --> 00:32:32.850
The federal government
bails them out.

00:32:32.850 --> 00:32:36.590
And then the financial community
condemns the federal government

00:32:36.590 --> 00:32:38.810
for irresponsibility.

00:32:38.810 --> 00:32:40.000
This is an American sport.

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:43.252
And we go through it
over and over again.

00:32:43.252 --> 00:32:45.210
The problem with Europe
was that they had never

00:32:45.210 --> 00:32:48.100
gone through a financial crisis.

00:32:48.100 --> 00:32:49.970
They'd never done it before.

00:32:49.970 --> 00:32:51.010
They had no model.

00:32:51.010 --> 00:32:53.080
They had no kind
of expectations.

00:32:53.080 --> 00:32:55.690
No one was cutting them
slack to get out of it.

00:32:55.690 --> 00:32:57.470
But more than
that, the Americans

00:32:57.470 --> 00:33:04.330
had had one Fed chairman, one
secretary of the treasury,

00:33:04.330 --> 00:33:05.100
and eight banks.

00:33:05.100 --> 00:33:07.570
Well, the Europeans
had eight banks.

00:33:07.570 --> 00:33:10.590
The Europeans had one ECB.

00:33:10.590 --> 00:33:15.610
But they had over 20
finance ministers.

00:33:15.610 --> 00:33:18.680
And try to get them together
into a room to settle anything.

00:33:21.800 --> 00:33:27.040
The subprime crisis shook
the European banking system.

00:33:27.040 --> 00:33:28.800
They bought lousy paper.

00:33:28.800 --> 00:33:30.900
And the Europeans
always accuse-- saying,

00:33:30.900 --> 00:33:32.445
the Americans started this.

00:33:32.445 --> 00:33:33.750
My point is, hey, idiot.

00:33:33.750 --> 00:33:35.630
Why'd you buy it?

00:33:35.630 --> 00:33:38.936
The point is that the Europeans
will point to everyone else.

00:33:38.936 --> 00:33:40.460
But they bought it.

00:33:40.460 --> 00:33:43.210
And it shook the
financial system.

00:33:43.210 --> 00:33:46.410
And that revealed the
fundamental fault line

00:33:46.410 --> 00:33:49.620
of European reality.

00:33:49.620 --> 00:33:53.350
Germany is the world's
fourth largest economy.

00:33:53.350 --> 00:33:57.080
It exports almost
50% of its GDP.

00:33:57.080 --> 00:34:01.480
That is, 50% of its GDP, half
of its GDP, comes from exports.

00:34:04.940 --> 00:34:07.910
Half of those exports go to
the European Free Trade Zone.

00:34:07.910 --> 00:34:11.104
A little over half.

00:34:11.104 --> 00:34:16.030
With that sort of
constant surge of exports,

00:34:16.030 --> 00:34:20.679
it is almost impossible
for European countries

00:34:20.679 --> 00:34:23.380
om the periphery to develop.

00:34:23.380 --> 00:34:27.870
Imagine if the United States
exported 50% of its GDP,

00:34:27.870 --> 00:34:29.940
and depended on that.

00:34:29.940 --> 00:34:33.179
And half of it would go
to Canada and Mexico.

00:34:33.179 --> 00:34:36.600
What would the condition
of Canada and Mexico be?

00:34:36.600 --> 00:34:38.520
This is what the Germans do.

00:34:38.520 --> 00:34:40.945
Their industrial plan,
their economic plan,

00:34:40.945 --> 00:34:45.070
is far greater than it
can consume domestically.

00:34:45.070 --> 00:34:46.800
If they don't
export, they're going

00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:50.980
to have massive unemployment
and economic instability.

00:34:50.980 --> 00:34:53.030
They must export.

00:34:53.030 --> 00:34:56.969
And for them, The European
Union was a system

00:34:56.969 --> 00:34:59.500
for maintaining their exports.

00:34:59.500 --> 00:35:03.020
First, they had access
to all these markets

00:35:03.020 --> 00:35:05.880
as if it were their own.

00:35:05.880 --> 00:35:09.960
Second, they had the political
power the price the Euro

00:35:09.960 --> 00:35:14.130
at exactly the point they
wanted to prevent inflation

00:35:14.130 --> 00:35:16.120
but facilitate exports.

00:35:16.120 --> 00:35:18.610
Whereas the southern
Europeans had

00:35:18.610 --> 00:35:21.090
to have some much lower price.

00:35:21.090 --> 00:35:23.130
They couldn't get it.

00:35:23.130 --> 00:35:30.060
Finally, they created a
reality through Brussels.

00:35:30.060 --> 00:35:31.950
Just as Washington
creates regulations,

00:35:31.950 --> 00:35:35.030
Brussels creates regulations.

00:35:35.030 --> 00:35:38.880
And the Brussels regulations,
plus the tax structure

00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:42.690
of Europe, made entrepreneurial
activity impossible.

00:35:42.690 --> 00:35:44.565
Entrepreneurial activity
in the United States

00:35:44.565 --> 00:35:48.270
is possible first, because
the tax structure is such

00:35:48.270 --> 00:35:52.860
that if you happen to hit a
home run, you're gonna enjoy it.

00:35:52.860 --> 00:35:54.680
The tax structure in
Europe is confiscatory

00:35:54.680 --> 00:35:59.730
at a certain level, so the
risk/reward ratio isn't there.

00:35:59.730 --> 00:36:10.160
Secondly, they developed
rules and regulations

00:36:10.160 --> 00:36:16.280
on everything from human
resources to health care.

00:36:16.280 --> 00:36:18.610
In the United States, if
you try to be entrepreneur,

00:36:18.610 --> 00:36:20.980
it doesn't work, you go
bankrupt, you walk away.

00:36:20.980 --> 00:36:24.340
When I started Strafor, I
didn't know what I was doing.

00:36:24.340 --> 00:36:27.570
But if I had failed, I
could put it behind me.

00:36:27.570 --> 00:36:29.830
In Europe, you
don't hire people.

00:36:29.830 --> 00:36:31.810
You adopt them.

00:36:31.810 --> 00:36:34.100
They live with you forever.

00:36:34.100 --> 00:36:36.460
It takes you a
long time to unwind

00:36:36.460 --> 00:36:39.280
entrepreneurial activity.

00:36:39.280 --> 00:36:42.190
And so one of the
things that happened

00:36:42.190 --> 00:36:47.060
here was that the European
1950s corporation was never

00:36:47.060 --> 00:36:50.130
challenged like
the American was.

00:36:50.130 --> 00:36:56.470
It never was challenged
because there

00:36:56.470 --> 00:36:59.830
was no Google coming up at them.

00:36:59.830 --> 00:37:02.790
Siemens was impervious.

00:37:02.790 --> 00:37:03.980
And that was no accident.

00:37:03.980 --> 00:37:04.960
It was built that way.

00:37:04.960 --> 00:37:09.570
And the reason that Europeans
came after both Microsoft

00:37:09.570 --> 00:37:12.590
and Google on antitrust
and regulatory issues

00:37:12.590 --> 00:37:14.410
was to make it more
and more difficult

00:37:14.410 --> 00:37:15.980
for them to operate in Europe.

00:37:15.980 --> 00:37:19.000
Because for Germany, Siemens
and the large corporations

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:26.500
were social-- their system
of social nets under them.

00:37:26.500 --> 00:37:28.560
You got a job at Siemens.

00:37:28.560 --> 00:37:29.540
You got promoted.

00:37:29.540 --> 00:37:30.980
You rose in the systems.

00:37:30.980 --> 00:37:32.520
You did in 1950s.

00:37:32.520 --> 00:37:34.400
It was social stability.

00:37:34.400 --> 00:37:38.740
It was inefficient, but
it soaked up excess labor.

00:37:38.740 --> 00:37:40.770
What happened in
the other countries?

00:37:40.770 --> 00:37:45.660
What happened in countries
like Romania or Italy?

00:37:45.660 --> 00:37:49.490
Because it was impossible to
be legally entrepreneurial,

00:37:49.490 --> 00:37:52.230
you became illegally
entrepreneurial.

00:37:52.230 --> 00:37:54.510
You lived on the margins.

00:37:54.510 --> 00:37:58.170
And in living on the
margins in these countries,

00:37:58.170 --> 00:38:01.050
the government knew
you were doing it.

00:38:01.050 --> 00:38:02.550
They knew you weren't
paying taxes--

00:38:02.550 --> 00:38:04.000
not the Romanians,
or the Greeks,

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:06.027
or the Italians who wanted
to pay taxes anyway.

00:38:06.027 --> 00:38:08.610
But you're certainly not going
to pay taxes if you're illegal.

00:38:08.610 --> 00:38:12.850
But the government wanted you
to do it to maintain employment.

00:38:12.850 --> 00:38:16.445
Because the German
pressure was so heavy,

00:38:16.445 --> 00:38:18.570
and the Germans are coming
in and buying all assets

00:38:18.570 --> 00:38:22.730
that are worth anything, that
you have to be off the books.

00:38:22.730 --> 00:38:27.710
As a result you wound up
with a sovereign debt crisis.

00:38:27.710 --> 00:38:32.530
That is to say, because the tax
base couldn't support repayment

00:38:32.530 --> 00:38:36.310
after the subprime
crisis, the banking system

00:38:36.310 --> 00:38:41.570
now faced a second major
crisis, a bigger one.

00:38:41.570 --> 00:38:45.130
The bonds that governments
had sold couldn't be redeemed.

00:38:45.130 --> 00:38:48.300
And then a question came up,
how do we solve this problem?

00:38:48.300 --> 00:38:50.870
And there were two
solutions to this.

00:38:50.870 --> 00:38:54.870
One solution was that Germany,
leading northern European

00:38:54.870 --> 00:38:57.980
countries, would
underwrite the bad debts.

00:38:57.980 --> 00:39:03.600
And the other was that
we would impose austerity

00:39:03.600 --> 00:39:06.870
on the southern
European countries.

00:39:06.870 --> 00:39:09.140
And the Germans thought
about this for three minutes.

00:39:09.140 --> 00:39:12.780
And they said, I think we
should impose austerity.

00:39:12.780 --> 00:39:16.370
And the Eurocrats-- that thin
layer of financial people,

00:39:16.370 --> 00:39:20.370
journalists, and so
on-- accepted this idea

00:39:20.370 --> 00:39:23.120
that we'll force
them to pay it back.

00:39:23.120 --> 00:39:24.120
They'll have a bad time.

00:39:24.120 --> 00:39:26.480
And then it'll all
straighten out.

00:39:26.480 --> 00:39:30.300
What they didn't realize
was the massive consequences

00:39:30.300 --> 00:39:31.740
that they would set off.

00:39:31.740 --> 00:39:34.160
And the IIMF has now admitted
that they didn't get it.

00:39:36.720 --> 00:39:42.090
In Greece, unemployment
is now 26%.

00:39:42.090 --> 00:39:45.060
In Spain it is 23%.

00:39:45.060 --> 00:39:46.565
In Southern Italy it is 22%.

00:39:49.120 --> 00:39:53.470
In central France it is 20%.

00:39:53.470 --> 00:39:58.280
In other words-- and I should
add-- unemployment for those

00:39:58.280 --> 00:40:03.940
25 years or less is 50% to 60%.

00:40:03.940 --> 00:40:06.830
These are the same numbers that
existed in the United States

00:40:06.830 --> 00:40:09.720
during the Great Depression.

00:40:09.720 --> 00:40:13.440
This is a depression
in southern Europe.

00:40:13.440 --> 00:40:18.240
Where Germany has
5% unemployment,

00:40:18.240 --> 00:40:21.230
southern Europe
is in depression.

00:40:21.230 --> 00:40:24.060
And this is a depression that
it can't easily recover from.

00:40:26.830 --> 00:40:29.650
What this has now become
is not a financial problem,

00:40:29.650 --> 00:40:32.690
it's a political issue.

00:40:32.690 --> 00:40:38.400
When the very poor
become poor, it hurts.

00:40:38.400 --> 00:40:40.800
But they understand
the grammar of poverty,

00:40:40.800 --> 00:40:43.660
the structure of what
it means to be poor.

00:40:43.660 --> 00:40:48.910
The people who were hit
in the government cutbacks

00:40:48.910 --> 00:40:53.590
were doctors, engineers, they
were the professional classes,

00:40:53.590 --> 00:40:57.190
who in Europe are heavily
employed by the state,

00:40:57.190 --> 00:41:00.200
because the state has
a much broader reach.

00:41:00.200 --> 00:41:03.890
So, and you have a
national health system,

00:41:03.890 --> 00:41:07.085
and you cut everybody's salary
by 50%, you're cutting doctors.

00:41:09.770 --> 00:41:13.480
When the middle class, which
has a clear expectation of what

00:41:13.480 --> 00:41:17.910
Europe would mean for them,
that they would have if you're

00:41:17.910 --> 00:41:21.450
Romanian and you're Italian,
and you come into the EU,

00:41:21.450 --> 00:41:23.910
you will have a European life.

00:41:23.910 --> 00:41:26.770
And it's defined by Germany,
maybe not as well as Germany,

00:41:26.770 --> 00:41:30.070
but still, you'll
have a European life.

00:41:30.070 --> 00:41:33.170
And you'll realize over
time that that life is gone.

00:41:33.170 --> 00:41:39.240
So if you were 40
years old in 2008,

00:41:39.240 --> 00:41:40.720
and you started
to lose your job,

00:41:40.720 --> 00:41:45.505
and your salary was being cut
from 3,000 Euros to 800 Euros--

00:41:45.505 --> 00:41:48.130
as happened in some
people's case--

00:41:48.130 --> 00:41:52.090
if you go down this list,
what happens to you?

00:41:52.090 --> 00:41:56.030
You suddenly realize
at a certain point

00:41:56.030 --> 00:41:58.290
it's not going to get better.

00:41:58.290 --> 00:42:00.770
You suddenly realize
that this is not ending.

00:42:00.770 --> 00:42:02.360
This is not a cyclical thing.

00:42:02.360 --> 00:42:03.760
That's not temporary.

00:42:03.760 --> 00:42:05.920
I've been doing this
for seven years.

00:42:05.920 --> 00:42:09.110
And the problem is not that
some Think Tank in Brussels

00:42:09.110 --> 00:42:12.720
didn't think up the solution,
it is that the Germans cannot

00:42:12.720 --> 00:42:17.030
afford to change their behavior
because of what they would

00:42:17.030 --> 00:42:20.590
suffer, and therefore we're
locked into this position.

00:42:20.590 --> 00:42:25.610
And that leads to what happens
whenever the middle classes are

00:42:25.610 --> 00:42:27.010
devastated.

00:42:27.010 --> 00:42:29.170
The rise of radical
parties, particularly

00:42:29.170 --> 00:42:31.180
of the right wing,
because you have

00:42:31.180 --> 00:42:34.030
to find an explanation
for what's wrong.

00:42:34.030 --> 00:42:38.990
And what the answer you find
is that someone caused it.

00:42:38.990 --> 00:42:42.330
And we must protect ourselves
from that by nationalism,

00:42:42.330 --> 00:42:45.910
by closing our borders,
and the Muslims

00:42:45.910 --> 00:42:48.200
are a particular problem.

00:42:48.200 --> 00:42:51.500
And by the way, the
Jews are a problem too.

00:42:51.500 --> 00:42:56.510
And you come up with a solution
that the middle class comes up

00:42:56.510 --> 00:42:58.590
with when they've
lost everything.

00:42:58.590 --> 00:43:03.250
And one of things that the
European elite never got

00:43:03.250 --> 00:43:05.950
was that as they were
stabilizing their banks,

00:43:05.950 --> 00:43:10.540
they were creating a system
of political backlash

00:43:10.540 --> 00:43:13.320
that would threaten the entire
system they had created.

00:43:13.320 --> 00:43:16.900
They thought they could keep
everybody in their place.

00:43:16.900 --> 00:43:18.740
And of course, when
you're devastated

00:43:18.740 --> 00:43:21.920
like the Europeans were,
you can't keep everybody

00:43:21.920 --> 00:43:22.880
in their place.

00:43:22.880 --> 00:43:24.970
And everybody came
out of their place.

00:43:24.970 --> 00:43:26.630
And so what we see
now in Europe is

00:43:26.630 --> 00:43:28.280
the rise of brand new parties.

00:43:28.280 --> 00:43:29.977
In Greece, it was
a left wing party,

00:43:29.977 --> 00:43:32.060
which has the same position
as a right wing party,

00:43:32.060 --> 00:43:35.660
but they don't dislike Muslims.

00:43:35.660 --> 00:43:37.240
That's the difference.

00:43:37.240 --> 00:43:39.700
But these are parties
that are basically saying,

00:43:39.700 --> 00:43:41.960
we're not going to pay you back.

00:43:41.960 --> 00:43:46.610
The Hungarians pioneered this.

00:43:46.610 --> 00:43:49.430
They gave mortgages
out-- Austrian banks,

00:43:49.430 --> 00:43:53.410
Italian banks-- gave
mortgages denominated in Euro,

00:43:53.410 --> 00:43:57.850
in Swiss francs, in
yen, anything you want.

00:43:57.850 --> 00:43:59.060
Low cost.

00:43:59.060 --> 00:44:01.920
But nobody counted on
the forint collapsing.

00:44:01.920 --> 00:44:04.970
The Hungarian government
went to the banks

00:44:04.970 --> 00:44:07.250
and said on behalf of
their mortgage holders,

00:44:07.250 --> 00:44:10.300
we're gonna pay you
back in forints.

00:44:10.300 --> 00:44:14.054
And we're gonna give you
about $0.60 on the dollar.

00:44:14.054 --> 00:44:15.395
Or we'll give you nothing.

00:44:15.395 --> 00:44:18.460
Give me a call in the morning
and tell me what you want.

00:44:18.460 --> 00:44:21.720
In other words, the debtor,
when he owes enough money,

00:44:21.720 --> 00:44:25.830
controls the situation,
not the lender.

00:44:25.830 --> 00:44:26.670
Old story.

00:44:26.670 --> 00:44:28.560
I I owe you $100, you've got me.

00:44:28.560 --> 00:44:31.401
If I owe you a billion
dollars, I've got you.

00:44:31.401 --> 00:44:35.570
And what the Southern European
countries are realizing is one,

00:44:35.570 --> 00:44:39.310
they cannot live with the
situation that's been created.

00:44:39.310 --> 00:44:41.310
That default is better
than not default.

00:44:41.310 --> 00:44:42.930
And secondly,
Germany can't afford

00:44:42.930 --> 00:44:46.770
to let them default, for
all the bluffing going on.

00:44:46.770 --> 00:44:48.330
Germany can't afford this.

00:44:48.330 --> 00:44:51.770
They need to keep
the free trade zone.

00:44:51.770 --> 00:44:53.830
We saw this recently
in quantitative easing,

00:44:53.830 --> 00:44:56.160
which is a very nice
term for printing money.

00:44:56.160 --> 00:44:59.330
I like it.

00:44:59.330 --> 00:45:01.770
Printing money was
printed by the ECB,

00:45:01.770 --> 00:45:05.000
but it was administered
by national banks.

00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:05.700
Why?

00:45:05.700 --> 00:45:07.930
Because the national
banks could only

00:45:07.930 --> 00:45:11.410
buy paper from their own
country, which means default

00:45:11.410 --> 00:45:13.530
could not affect
Germany or others.

00:45:13.530 --> 00:45:15.400
But also, none of the
European countries

00:45:15.400 --> 00:45:16.840
trusted the European
Central Bank

00:45:16.840 --> 00:45:21.860
to be impartial, to buy
the papers they had to.

00:45:21.860 --> 00:45:25.120
We're now back at
the Nation State.

00:45:25.120 --> 00:45:28.596
And in Europe, when you're
back at the Nation State,

00:45:28.596 --> 00:45:29.762
you're at a dangerous point.

00:45:32.860 --> 00:45:36.700
The United States had
a very similar problem.

00:45:36.700 --> 00:45:38.410
And the problem the
United States had

00:45:38.410 --> 00:45:43.560
was in 1861, a vast dispute
on all sorts of issues

00:45:43.560 --> 00:45:45.690
between the South in the North.

00:45:45.690 --> 00:45:51.210
And the South said,
we could withdraw

00:45:51.210 --> 00:45:52.602
from the American Union.

00:45:55.250 --> 00:46:02.490
And the result was a Civil War
in which hundreds of thousands

00:46:02.490 --> 00:46:06.660
of Americans on both
sides gave their life,

00:46:06.660 --> 00:46:10.010
and the Battle of Gettysburg
fought to save the Union.

00:46:10.010 --> 00:46:12.930
Antietam and other places.

00:46:12.930 --> 00:46:16.590
Who will die to save
the European Union?

00:46:16.590 --> 00:46:21.260
How could Europe create a
grand RB of the Republic?

00:46:21.260 --> 00:46:27.790
It has no moral promise
except prosperity and peace.

00:46:27.790 --> 00:46:29.890
You can't die for
prosperity and peace.

00:46:29.890 --> 00:46:32.930
For life, liberty, and
the pursuit of happiness,

00:46:32.930 --> 00:46:34.999
we hold these truths
to be self evident

00:46:34.999 --> 00:46:36.290
that all men are created equal.

00:46:36.290 --> 00:46:38.090
There is a moral component.

00:46:38.090 --> 00:46:40.660
And you've been demonstrated
that moral component.

00:46:40.660 --> 00:46:43.700
We fought the Civil War
and saved the Republic.

00:46:43.700 --> 00:46:45.760
The Europeans have
no moral component.

00:46:45.760 --> 00:46:48.160
They only have a
prudential component.

00:46:48.160 --> 00:46:51.770
And the fact that
they fear each other,

00:46:51.770 --> 00:46:55.830
dislike each other, for a
very good reasons going back

00:46:55.830 --> 00:46:57.580
many years.

00:46:57.580 --> 00:46:59.650
My mother never
forgave the Romanians,

00:46:59.650 --> 00:47:03.330
and I have no idea what the
Romanians ever did to her.

00:47:03.330 --> 00:47:04.530
But it doesn't matter.

00:47:04.530 --> 00:47:06.000
If they didn't do
it to her, it was

00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:08.070
her great, great grandmother.

00:47:08.070 --> 00:47:12.541
These are countries that are
different, do not share faiths,

00:47:12.541 --> 00:47:15.040
and have never held together.

00:47:15.040 --> 00:47:20.260
And we are now at the beginning
where it's all coming apart.

00:47:20.260 --> 00:47:24.650
And already we hear
the guns in Ukraine.

00:47:24.650 --> 00:47:30.610
So all of the promises that
were made are in question.

00:47:30.610 --> 00:47:34.930
And when Europe goes into
question, the world trembles.

00:47:34.930 --> 00:47:36.670
Let me stop there and
ask for questions.

00:47:36.670 --> 00:47:37.622
Thank you.

00:47:42.870 --> 00:47:45.520
AUDIENCE: So are you
kind of-- your theory

00:47:45.520 --> 00:47:48.030
is that if there would be
a large hegemonic power

00:47:48.030 --> 00:47:50.810
in the room, similar to like,
the United States, in Europe

00:47:50.810 --> 00:47:53.356
still, this issue
wouldn't happen.

00:47:53.356 --> 00:47:55.480
So if the Cold War never
ended, and the Berlin Wall

00:47:55.480 --> 00:47:58.374
didn't fall, this
wouldn't be an issue.

00:47:58.374 --> 00:47:59.290
GEORGE FRIEDMAN: Yeah.

00:47:59.290 --> 00:48:02.340
I mean, the reason
that Europe did not

00:48:02.340 --> 00:48:04.625
have a World War
III among itself,

00:48:04.625 --> 00:48:07.090
is that it was occupied by
the Americans and Soviets,

00:48:07.090 --> 00:48:09.940
and they didn't
want to have one.

00:48:09.940 --> 00:48:12.490
But it's not simply a
question of somebody

00:48:12.490 --> 00:48:13.540
having hegemonic power.

00:48:13.540 --> 00:48:15.820
There's a dynamic in
Europe between Germany

00:48:15.820 --> 00:48:18.380
and the rest of Europe
that's in play here.

00:48:18.380 --> 00:48:22.550
Ever since 1871,
when Germany unified,

00:48:22.550 --> 00:48:25.090
Germany has been the most
dynamic economic power

00:48:25.090 --> 00:48:29.910
in Europe, and scare the
hell out of everybody.

00:48:29.910 --> 00:48:33.540
The German question has always
been unlike the British,

00:48:33.540 --> 00:48:36.360
they have no empire
to sell it to.

00:48:36.360 --> 00:48:42.290
They are incredibly creative,
incredibly efficient,

00:48:42.290 --> 00:48:44.490
and very aggressive.

00:48:44.490 --> 00:48:46.160
This time they don't
have an army yet,

00:48:46.160 --> 00:48:47.910
which is the good news.

00:48:47.910 --> 00:48:52.650
But they're still
behaving in the same way.

00:48:52.650 --> 00:48:55.820
Ever since Germany united,
Europe destabilized.

00:48:55.820 --> 00:48:58.680
And while the United States
occupied the Western half,

00:48:58.680 --> 00:49:02.490
and the Soviets the Eastern
half, it was a moot question.

00:49:02.490 --> 00:49:04.790
Now the Europeans have to
work it out themselves.

00:49:04.790 --> 00:49:07.180
And they never have easily.

00:49:07.180 --> 00:49:09.920
AUDIENCE: What's so special
about the Germans, then?

00:49:09.920 --> 00:49:13.970
Why have they succeeded
after World War II, when

00:49:13.970 --> 00:49:18.600
the Southern European
countries did not?

00:49:18.600 --> 00:49:20.700
GEORGE FRIEDMAN: That's
an extremely good question

00:49:20.700 --> 00:49:22.200
to which I don't
have a good answer.

00:49:22.200 --> 00:49:25.320
But it's one on which
Max Weber and many people

00:49:25.320 --> 00:49:29.280
wrote, "Protestant Ethic and
the Spirit of Capitalism."

00:49:29.280 --> 00:49:36.250
It has to do, I think, with
the fact that when it's united,

00:49:36.250 --> 00:49:38.250
it unites well.

00:49:38.250 --> 00:49:40.850
In other words, unlike Italy
where the northern Italians

00:49:40.850 --> 00:49:43.260
still don't get along with
the southern Italians,

00:49:43.260 --> 00:49:45.490
the Bavarians and the
rest of the Germans,

00:49:45.490 --> 00:49:49.710
you know, Munich and Frankfurt
and Berlin all unite,

00:49:49.710 --> 00:49:53.470
they are also
culturally vigorous.

00:49:53.470 --> 00:49:55.550
And they're also scared.

00:49:55.550 --> 00:49:57.640
One of things about
the Germans is

00:49:57.640 --> 00:49:59.460
they remember the
period for hundreds

00:49:59.460 --> 00:50:00.900
of years when they
were fragmented

00:50:00.900 --> 00:50:04.060
into many small nations.

00:50:04.060 --> 00:50:06.520
And their terror is that
it's going to happen again.

00:50:06.520 --> 00:50:11.590
And they keep losing war,
so the terror is real.

00:50:11.590 --> 00:50:15.040
They therefore
create states that

00:50:15.040 --> 00:50:18.890
are very effective in mobilizing
economic activity to build

00:50:18.890 --> 00:50:20.910
economic activity.

00:50:20.910 --> 00:50:23.620
I think this is an
insufficient answer,

00:50:23.620 --> 00:50:25.740
but it's the only answer I have.

00:50:25.740 --> 00:50:29.870
But empirically, we know
that Germany does do this.

00:50:29.870 --> 00:50:32.270
And while I can't
fully explain it,

00:50:32.270 --> 00:50:34.880
I can say it is a
dynamic of Europe that's

00:50:34.880 --> 00:50:36.250
empirically clear.

00:50:36.250 --> 00:50:37.920
AUDIENCE: How do
you feel a Marshall

00:50:37.920 --> 00:50:39.500
Plan might have
played into this?

00:50:39.500 --> 00:50:42.140
Has the United States
overdone the effort

00:50:42.140 --> 00:50:44.550
of rebuilding Germany
at the expense

00:50:44.550 --> 00:50:47.364
of other countries
in the region?

00:50:47.364 --> 00:50:48.780
GEORGE FRIEDMAN:
The United States

00:50:48.780 --> 00:50:54.710
had to rebuild them, because
the Cold War required first,

00:50:54.710 --> 00:50:58.210
that the West be
self-sufficient-- Western

00:50:58.210 --> 00:51:00.730
Europe be self-sufficient,
and secondly, that they

00:51:00.730 --> 00:51:03.470
have substantial arms.

00:51:03.470 --> 00:51:05.820
Once you begin the
process of rebuilding,

00:51:05.820 --> 00:51:07.800
it take on a life of its own.

00:51:07.800 --> 00:51:09.740
It doesn't end,
and shouldn't end.

00:51:09.740 --> 00:51:12.110
That was the entire idea.

00:51:12.110 --> 00:51:15.024
There is no way of
limiting prosperity.

00:51:15.024 --> 00:51:16.690
Now the countries
that the United States

00:51:16.690 --> 00:51:18.910
is most concerned
with is Germany,

00:51:18.910 --> 00:51:22.720
because it's right on the
front line in the Cold War.

00:51:22.720 --> 00:51:24.600
And of course, France.

00:51:24.600 --> 00:51:26.530
And to a lesser extent, Britain.

00:51:26.530 --> 00:51:29.610
Britain was very bitter that
it wasn't the forerunner.

00:51:29.610 --> 00:51:34.380
And Italy, because both of them
have strong Communist parties.

00:51:34.380 --> 00:51:38.710
Greece, Spain, it had
much less to do with.

00:51:38.710 --> 00:51:40.640
But it was really the
North European plain

00:51:40.640 --> 00:51:43.700
that the Americans
were obsessed with,

00:51:43.700 --> 00:51:45.660
because if the Soviets
attacked, that's

00:51:45.660 --> 00:51:47.260
where the attack would come.

00:51:47.260 --> 00:51:50.300
And that's where they
had to have blockers.

00:51:50.300 --> 00:51:55.270
So certainly the Marshall
Plan kicked off this process.

00:51:55.270 --> 00:51:58.000
But it wasn't that the
United States could limit it.

00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:02.390
Once you put the Germans back
to work, they're back to work.

00:52:02.390 --> 00:52:04.350
And they work well.

00:52:04.350 --> 00:52:13.220
And so Americans like to
moralize whose fault it is.

00:52:13.220 --> 00:52:14.790
This is not anyone's fault.

00:52:14.790 --> 00:52:16.010
It's not the Germans' fault.

00:52:16.010 --> 00:52:17.620
They're not greedy or vicious.

00:52:17.620 --> 00:52:19.360
It's not the Southern
Europeans' fault.

00:52:19.360 --> 00:52:22.150
It is the nature
built into Europe.

00:52:22.150 --> 00:52:24.290
So I would argue-- and
that's an important point

00:52:24.290 --> 00:52:27.320
I want to make-- is there's
no blaming the Germans.

00:52:27.320 --> 00:52:28.900
They are in the
position they're in.

00:52:28.900 --> 00:52:30.370
And they have to deal with it.

00:52:30.370 --> 00:52:33.130
There's no blaming, in
my mind, the Greeks.

00:52:33.130 --> 00:52:34.825
There's no blaming the Russians.

00:52:34.825 --> 00:52:37.705
We are all playing out the
hand that we have to play out.

00:52:37.705 --> 00:52:39.790
And unfortunately, in
the case of Europe,

00:52:39.790 --> 00:52:42.317
this hand frequently
winds up in a bad place.

00:52:42.317 --> 00:52:44.150
AUDIENCE: Could you
comment on your thoughts

00:52:44.150 --> 00:52:47.384
of the influence of
US foreign policy

00:52:47.384 --> 00:52:48.800
right now in Europe,
because there

00:52:48.800 --> 00:52:53.150
are some lines of thoughts
about US foreign policy

00:52:53.150 --> 00:52:56.190
being interested in taking
Europe down a notch,

00:52:56.190 --> 00:52:57.860
Europe becoming too strong.

00:52:57.860 --> 00:53:04.830
And specifically, US influence
in the Ukraine crisis.

00:53:04.830 --> 00:53:07.570
GEORGE FRIEDMAN: I
don't see the US have

00:53:07.570 --> 00:53:11.340
the ability of taking
down Europe a notch.

00:53:11.340 --> 00:53:13.800
Europeans are doing
what they're doing.

00:53:13.800 --> 00:53:15.900
There's very little
that the United States

00:53:15.900 --> 00:53:19.520
could do to take it
down, if they want to.

00:53:19.520 --> 00:53:22.290
The problem of
Europe is that having

00:53:22.290 --> 00:53:26.700
bought into peace
and prosperity,

00:53:26.700 --> 00:53:30.720
they essentially-- many of them
dismantle their militaries.

00:53:30.720 --> 00:53:32.990
So NATO no longer functions.

00:53:32.990 --> 00:53:34.380
It's a military
alliance, but you

00:53:34.380 --> 00:53:36.970
can't have one if
there's no military.

00:53:36.970 --> 00:53:38.430
So France has a military.

00:53:38.430 --> 00:53:39.930
Britain has a military.

00:53:39.930 --> 00:53:43.600
But the rest of the
countries really don't.

00:53:43.600 --> 00:53:46.380
The United States looks
at Europe and says,

00:53:46.380 --> 00:53:50.940
I think, reluctantly,
there is no Europe here.

00:53:50.940 --> 00:53:51.910
There is Paris.

00:53:51.910 --> 00:53:53.000
There is Berlin.

00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:53.780
There's Spain.

00:53:53.780 --> 00:53:57.260
And they all have very
different policies.

00:53:57.260 --> 00:53:59.510
So we have no one to talk to.

00:53:59.510 --> 00:54:00.500
We talk to the British.

00:54:00.500 --> 00:54:02.780
We talk to the French.

00:54:02.780 --> 00:54:05.830
But now we have a
crisis in the Ukraine.

00:54:05.830 --> 00:54:08.610
From the Russian point of
view, as I said before,

00:54:08.610 --> 00:54:13.020
they read this as a coup
d'etat by the United States,

00:54:13.020 --> 00:54:18.720
taking the elected
president of Ukraine,

00:54:18.720 --> 00:54:20.950
changing the Constitution
on Sunday morning,

00:54:20.950 --> 00:54:24.440
and impeaching him, and imposing
a pro-Western government.

00:54:24.440 --> 00:54:29.400
From the American point of view,
he was corrupt and oppressive.

00:54:29.400 --> 00:54:32.140
And people rose against it.

00:54:32.140 --> 00:54:34.880
Philosophy aside,
Ukraine is fundamental

00:54:34.880 --> 00:54:37.590
to the national
interest of Russia.

00:54:37.590 --> 00:54:40.480
This is where the
Wehrmacht was destroyed.

00:54:40.480 --> 00:54:43.290
This is where they
perceive themselves.

00:54:43.290 --> 00:54:50.320
This is a place that is
70 miles from Stalingrad.

00:54:50.320 --> 00:54:52.450
And 300 miles from Moscow.

00:54:52.450 --> 00:54:54.310
It has no natural defenses.

00:54:54.310 --> 00:54:57.240
They need the Ukraine,
because if Ukraine becomes

00:54:57.240 --> 00:55:00.324
part of a Western
defense system,

00:55:00.324 --> 00:55:01.990
everything in Russian
history tells them

00:55:01.990 --> 00:55:04.890
that whatever they think
now, later they will

00:55:04.890 --> 00:55:06.040
do what they want.

00:55:06.040 --> 00:55:09.570
Remember, Russia had Germany--
a weak, shattered country

00:55:09.570 --> 00:55:10.690
in 1932.

00:55:10.690 --> 00:55:14.950
By 1938, it was the most
powerful country in Europe.

00:55:14.950 --> 00:55:18.370
So the Russians have that view.

00:55:18.370 --> 00:55:21.460
The Americans also
have a 100-year history

00:55:21.460 --> 00:55:25.360
of one overriding
geopolitical interest--

00:55:25.360 --> 00:55:28.720
not allowing a regional hegemon
to control all of Europe.

00:55:28.720 --> 00:55:31.290
I went into the first
World War to stop that.

00:55:31.290 --> 00:55:33.430
It went into the Second
World War to stop that.

00:55:33.430 --> 00:55:36.560
It went into the Cold
War to stop that.

00:55:36.560 --> 00:55:38.370
There are many
crazy things we do.

00:55:38.370 --> 00:55:40.630
We invade Panama,
for some reason,

00:55:40.630 --> 00:55:41.920
that I could never figure out.

00:55:41.920 --> 00:55:43.090
And things of that sort.

00:55:43.090 --> 00:55:45.310
But these are trivial things.

00:55:45.310 --> 00:55:47.490
The fundamental things
that the Americans do

00:55:47.490 --> 00:55:51.190
is control the seas, and
watch the European peninsula

00:55:51.190 --> 00:55:52.810
for hegemon.

00:55:52.810 --> 00:55:56.770
If Russia takes Ukraine,
whatever the Russian intention

00:55:56.770 --> 00:56:01.100
is, the Americans think,
what will they do next?

00:56:01.100 --> 00:56:02.440
And so you have two countries.

00:56:02.440 --> 00:56:07.340
Now, the American's General
Hodges, a US Army Europe

00:56:07.340 --> 00:56:10.890
commander, visited
Kiev, said there

00:56:10.890 --> 00:56:13.740
would be traders
coming in officially.

00:56:13.740 --> 00:56:16.600
Only unofficial now.

00:56:16.600 --> 00:56:19.650
Pin medals on Ukrainian
soldiers who fought well,

00:56:19.650 --> 00:56:21.520
which is symbolically stunning.

00:56:21.520 --> 00:56:25.010
And then announce that we would
preposition armor, artillery,

00:56:25.010 --> 00:56:27.990
and other weapons in the
Baltics, Poland, Romania,

00:56:27.990 --> 00:56:30.880
and Bulgaria.

00:56:30.880 --> 00:56:33.410
So I mean, that is
quite an announcement

00:56:33.410 --> 00:56:35.970
for the United States to
make in the past two weeks.

00:56:35.970 --> 00:56:40.770
Then Kerry is announcing
a very aggressive policy.

00:56:40.770 --> 00:56:42.700
Biden is saying the same thing.

00:56:42.700 --> 00:56:45.515
So if you're the Russians,
you're coming to the conclusion

00:56:45.515 --> 00:56:48.619
that the United States
means to seize the Ukraine,

00:56:48.619 --> 00:56:50.660
and that means the end of
the Russian Federation,

00:56:50.660 --> 00:56:52.540
from their point of view.

00:56:52.540 --> 00:56:54.599
They have a window
of opportunity,

00:56:54.599 --> 00:56:56.890
because it will take the
Americans six months to a year

00:56:56.890 --> 00:56:59.820
to have any meaningful
force in the area.

00:56:59.820 --> 00:57:03.780
It is now the rainy season
where the roads are mud.

00:57:03.780 --> 00:57:07.230
That will end in
four to six weeks.

00:57:07.230 --> 00:57:08.280
And then we will see.

00:57:08.280 --> 00:57:11.180
In the meantime, Frau Merkel,
who really doesn't need

00:57:11.180 --> 00:57:12.417
this aggravation right now.

00:57:12.417 --> 00:57:14.500
It has enough problems
trying to hold the European

00:57:14.500 --> 00:57:15.410
Union together.

00:57:15.410 --> 00:57:18.040
It really doesn't need
a war in the Ukraine

00:57:18.040 --> 00:57:20.150
to make its life miserable.

00:57:20.150 --> 00:57:25.120
Is in Moscow today with
French President Hollande.

00:57:25.120 --> 00:57:29.200
And they're trying to get
Putin to listen to reason.

00:57:29.200 --> 00:57:31.130
But the Western reason
and the Russian reason

00:57:31.130 --> 00:57:33.400
are very different.

00:57:33.400 --> 00:57:36.090
The Russians, said to me--
I was in Moscow recently--

00:57:36.090 --> 00:57:38.080
and the Russians
said to me, look.

00:57:38.080 --> 00:57:40.600
We want this much.

00:57:40.600 --> 00:57:43.760
We'll give up Crimea, if that's
what is really bothering you.

00:57:43.760 --> 00:57:49.070
But we want in Eastern Ukraine.

00:57:49.070 --> 00:57:50.920
It could be part of
the Ukraine but it

00:57:50.920 --> 00:57:53.120
should be an autonomous zone.

00:57:53.120 --> 00:57:56.520
And they use this
like Quebec in Canada.

00:57:56.520 --> 00:57:57.020
OK.

00:57:57.020 --> 00:57:58.830
It speaks a different
language, so on.

00:57:58.830 --> 00:58:01.660
The United States is
absolutely opposed to this.

00:58:01.660 --> 00:58:04.470
And the Russian view is,
why would the United States

00:58:04.470 --> 00:58:05.920
be opposed to it?

00:58:05.920 --> 00:58:09.820
And therefore each side
is reading the other.

00:58:09.820 --> 00:58:11.130
And this is how wars start.

00:58:11.130 --> 00:58:13.860
Except neither side
wants a war, believe me.

00:58:13.860 --> 00:58:16.922
But the Europeans are
irrelevant to this.

00:58:16.922 --> 00:58:18.005
Merkel could go to Moscow.

00:58:18.005 --> 00:58:19.170
She has no force.

00:58:19.170 --> 00:58:21.300
She has no army.

00:58:21.300 --> 00:58:24.770
The Europeans are
playing a role that they

00:58:24.770 --> 00:58:26.870
played in the Cold War.

00:58:26.870 --> 00:58:28.686
They're inert.

00:58:28.686 --> 00:58:30.060
And that's what's
so interesting.

00:58:30.060 --> 00:58:32.970
This is a war that the
European Union should

00:58:32.970 --> 00:58:36.800
be busy not fighting about
putting down or making whatever

00:58:36.800 --> 00:58:37.730
arrangement they want.

00:58:37.730 --> 00:58:40.370
But they're in no position
to do what the Russians need,

00:58:40.370 --> 00:58:43.830
pulling them out of a
recession, depression,

00:58:43.830 --> 00:58:45.440
whatever you want to call it.

00:58:45.440 --> 00:58:49.360
So what you see here is that
unless the United States goes

00:58:49.360 --> 00:58:53.010
in, no one will go in.

00:58:53.010 --> 00:58:56.360
If the United States goes
in, then the Russians freak.

00:58:56.360 --> 00:59:00.240
If the Russians go in,
the Americans freak.

00:59:00.240 --> 00:59:03.330
And the Europeans
are primarily worried

00:59:03.330 --> 00:59:06.700
about who pays what bond when.

00:59:06.700 --> 00:59:10.720
So you have a total
asymmetry of interests

00:59:10.720 --> 00:59:14.830
and the kind of
intellectual chaos.

00:59:14.830 --> 00:59:20.460
AUDIENCE: So are we playing
to Putin's advantage?

00:59:20.460 --> 00:59:24.950
I mean, sort of pretending
to be aggressive,

00:59:24.950 --> 00:59:26.560
or acting aggressive.

00:59:26.560 --> 00:59:31.090
I mean, isn't that helping
Putin get stronger?

00:59:31.090 --> 00:59:34.010
GEORGE FRIEDMAN:
Well, the alternative

00:59:34.010 --> 00:59:37.480
is not to be aggressive, let
the Russians move forward,

00:59:37.480 --> 00:59:41.450
and occupy a position
bordering Romania, Hungary,

00:59:41.450 --> 00:59:43.060
Poland, and so on.

00:59:43.060 --> 00:59:50.782
So think about the run up
to World War II in Japan.

00:59:50.782 --> 00:59:57.010
The United States cut off the
sale of oil to the Japanese.

00:59:57.010 --> 01:00:01.290
It also went about buying up
oil in the Netherlands, East

01:00:01.290 --> 01:00:03.230
Indies-- Indonesia
today-- to keep

01:00:03.230 --> 01:00:05.869
the Japanese from buying it.

01:00:05.869 --> 01:00:07.660
The United States was
doing that because we

01:00:07.660 --> 01:00:11.290
wanted the Japanese to
pull out of Indochina.

01:00:11.290 --> 01:00:14.510
The view was that if we
do this, the Japanese

01:00:14.510 --> 01:00:16.275
will be under
tremendous pressure.

01:00:16.275 --> 01:00:20.060
The Japanese view was, if
we get into this pressure,

01:00:20.060 --> 01:00:22.050
there'll be more pressure.

01:00:22.050 --> 01:00:23.550
And we're accepting
the fact that we

01:00:23.550 --> 01:00:26.480
exist at the sufferings
of the United States.

01:00:26.480 --> 01:00:28.400
The result was Pearl Harbor.

01:00:28.400 --> 01:00:32.240
Wars don't originate with
some crazed mastermind.

01:00:32.240 --> 01:00:37.160
Even Hitler was bluffing
until his bluff was called.

01:00:37.160 --> 01:00:39.880
And once his bluff
was called in Poland,

01:00:39.880 --> 01:00:41.610
he either went or he didn't go.

01:00:41.610 --> 01:00:43.940
If he didn't go, there
would be consequences.

01:00:43.940 --> 01:00:47.270
So we went hoping that it
wouldn't mean anything.

01:00:47.270 --> 01:00:50.757
Wars begin with bluffing.

01:00:50.757 --> 01:00:52.840
And just like in a poker
game, at a certain point,

01:00:52.840 --> 01:00:55.554
you have to flip your cards.

01:00:55.554 --> 01:00:56.720
We're in the bluffing stage.

01:00:56.720 --> 01:00:59.700
And each side is hoping not
have to flip their cards.

01:00:59.700 --> 01:01:01.330
Neither the Russians
nor the Americans

01:01:01.330 --> 01:01:04.900
have any appetite for war
in the Ukraine, believe me.

01:01:04.900 --> 01:01:06.820
But that's not how wars begin.

01:01:06.820 --> 01:01:08.250
I don't think there will be one.

01:01:08.250 --> 01:01:10.150
I think they'll find
a way to back off.

01:01:10.150 --> 01:01:12.630
But actually, when
you play it out,

01:01:12.630 --> 01:01:16.544
it's hard to find that
place where they go.

01:01:16.544 --> 01:01:18.210
MALE SPEAKER: Please
join me in thanking

01:01:18.210 --> 01:01:19.970
George Friedman for
his [INAUDIBLE].

01:01:19.970 --> 01:01:23.320
[APPLAUSE]
