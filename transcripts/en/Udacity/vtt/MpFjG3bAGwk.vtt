00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:02.400
So, Michael wants us to do a quiz.

00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:05.830
Because Michael likes quizzes cause he thinks you like

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:08.010
quizzes. And so, I want you to answer

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.790
this question before Michael gets a chance to. So

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:16.149
just to be clear here's the question again. What happens to the distribution

00:00:16.149 --> 00:00:21.380
over a particular example i when the hypothesis ht that was output by the

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:26.700
example. Agrees with the particular label, Y-sub-i.

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:29.150
Okay, so we have four possibilities when they agree.

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:33.070
One is the probability of you seeing that particular

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:36.065
example increases. That is, you increase the value of

00:00:36.065 --> 00:00:38.730
D-sub-t on i. Or the probability of you seeing that

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.950
example decreases. That is, the number d of t

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:45.640
of i goes down, or it stays the same

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:49.380
when they agree or well it depends on exactly

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:52.190
what's going on with the old value of d and

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:54.870
alpha and all these other things. So ,you can't

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.230
really give just one of those other three answers.

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:59.474
So those are your possibilites. The other radio buttons

00:00:59.474 --> 00:01:02.470
[LAUGH] only one of them is right. And go.
