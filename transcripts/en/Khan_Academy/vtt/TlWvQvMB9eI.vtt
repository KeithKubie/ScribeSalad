00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.664
- [Voiceover] We're asked to
select the correct description.

00:00:02.664 --> 00:00:04.462
It looks like all the
descriptions deal with

00:00:04.462 --> 00:00:06.864
what is the limit of f
of x as we approach six

00:00:06.864 --> 00:00:10.816
from either the right hand side
or from the left hand side,

00:00:10.816 --> 00:00:12.538
so let's think about that.

00:00:12.538 --> 00:00:14.842
So first let me just
do the left hand side.

00:00:14.842 --> 00:00:16.675
So the limit of f of x

00:00:18.089 --> 00:00:22.058
as we approach six from
the left hand side,

00:00:22.058 --> 00:00:24.357
what is this going to be equal to?

00:00:24.357 --> 00:00:26.593
So as we approach from the left hand side

00:00:26.593 --> 00:00:29.011
we can see f of four
is a little under two,

00:00:29.011 --> 00:00:31.633
f of five looks like it's around three,

00:00:31.633 --> 00:00:34.653
f of 5.5 looks like it's a lot higher,

00:00:34.653 --> 00:00:38.700
f of 5.75 even is just
going off the charts,

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.689
so it looks like this is going unbounded

00:00:40.689 --> 00:00:42.660
in the positive direction, so we could say

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.323
that this right over here
is positive infinity,

00:00:46.323 --> 00:00:50.406
and if we were to think
about the limit of f of x

00:00:51.311 --> 00:00:55.319
as we approach six from the right side,

00:00:55.319 --> 00:00:56.961
what is this going to be?

00:00:56.961 --> 00:00:59.541
Well here, f of seven, it's negative,

00:00:59.541 --> 00:01:02.451
f of 7.5 is even more negative,

00:01:02.451 --> 00:01:05.034
f of 6.5 is even more negative,

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:12.069
f of 6.1 is way more negative than that,

00:01:12.069 --> 00:01:15.495
f of 6.01 would be even
more negative than that.

00:01:15.495 --> 00:01:17.324
So it looks like this is unbounded

00:01:17.324 --> 00:01:19.784
in the negative direction,
so this is negative infinity.

00:01:19.784 --> 00:01:22.335
so let's see which of our
choices match up to that.

00:01:22.335 --> 00:01:26.299
so the way they listed
it, they listed the limit

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:29.780
from the right direction
first, so that's this one,

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.877
so the limit of f of x as x approaches six

00:01:32.877 --> 00:01:36.749
from values greater than six,
we have negative infinity,

00:01:36.749 --> 00:01:40.713
so that is these two choices,
these two choices say that,

00:01:40.713 --> 00:01:43.589
so we're gonna rule out those two choices.

00:01:43.589 --> 00:01:46.980
And then we think about as
we approach six from the left

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:49.644
hand side, we see that we
go to positive infinity,

00:01:49.644 --> 00:01:51.869
and that is this choice right over here,

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:56.036
so we rule out that one, and
that is what we will pick.
