00:00:00.289 --> 00:00:02.112
- [Voiceover] Let's say
that I have two numbers

00:00:02.112 --> 00:00:03.013
on a number line.

00:00:03.013 --> 00:00:04.812
So let me draw a little quick number line

00:00:04.812 --> 00:00:06.037
right over here.

00:00:06.037 --> 00:00:08.104
The two numbers on my number line

00:00:08.104 --> 00:00:12.596
that I care about, the
number a and the number

00:00:12.596 --> 00:00:13.996
represented by b here.

00:00:13.996 --> 00:00:15.865
The way I've drawn it, b is to the right

00:00:15.865 --> 00:00:16.864
of a on our number line,

00:00:16.864 --> 00:00:18.669
and by our convention, b is going

00:00:18.669 --> 00:00:20.352
to be greater than a.

00:00:20.352 --> 00:00:21.757
So if I were to figure out the distance

00:00:21.757 --> 00:00:24.555
between a and b, what
is this distance going

00:00:24.555 --> 00:00:27.875
from a, I want to draw
a straight line here,

00:00:27.875 --> 00:00:31.857
this distance going from a to b,

00:00:31.857 --> 00:00:34.040
so this distance right over there,

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:35.730
how would I figure it out?

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:36.949
Well I could just take the larger

00:00:36.949 --> 00:00:38.934
of these two numbers,
which is going to be b,

00:00:38.934 --> 00:00:41.117
and then subtract out the smaller.

00:00:41.117 --> 00:00:42.730
So I subtract out a, and I'll be left

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:44.029
with this distance.

00:00:44.029 --> 00:00:45.848
This will give me a positive value.

00:00:45.848 --> 00:00:48.019
When I want a distance, I just think

00:00:48.019 --> 00:00:49.539
in terms of a positive value.

00:00:49.539 --> 00:00:52.059
How far apart are these two things?

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:54.647
But I was only able to
know to do b minus a

00:00:54.647 --> 00:00:56.946
because I knew that b was greater than a.

00:00:56.946 --> 00:00:58.885
This was going to give
me a positive value.

00:00:58.885 --> 00:01:01.218
What if I knew that a was greater than b?

00:01:01.218 --> 00:01:02.896
Well then I would do it
the other way around.

00:01:02.896 --> 00:01:04.280
So let me draw that again.

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.135
Let me draw another number
line right over here.

00:01:07.135 --> 00:01:09.469
In this world, in this world,

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:12.047
I'm going to make a greater than b.

00:01:14.065 --> 00:01:18.306
This is b, that is a,

00:01:18.306 --> 00:01:19.745
and if I wanted to calculate the distance

00:01:19.745 --> 00:01:22.880
between b and a here,

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.165
well now I would take
the larger of the two,

00:01:26.165 --> 00:01:28.557
a, remember I want the
positive distance here,

00:01:28.557 --> 00:01:30.216
and then I would subtract out the smaller.

00:01:30.216 --> 00:01:32.324
I would do a minus b.

00:01:32.324 --> 00:01:34.484
Well so here I did b minus a,

00:01:34.484 --> 00:01:35.947
here I did a minus b,

00:01:35.947 --> 00:01:37.943
but what if I didn't know
which one was greater?

00:01:37.943 --> 00:01:39.883
If I didn't know whether
b or a was greater,

00:01:39.883 --> 00:01:41.918
what could I do?

00:01:41.918 --> 00:01:44.797
Well what you could do is just take

00:01:44.797 --> 00:01:48.000
either a minus b or b minus a

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.438
and take the absolute value.

00:01:50.438 --> 00:01:51.680
If you do that, it doesn't matter

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.803
if you take b minus a or a minus b.

00:01:54.803 --> 00:01:57.706
It turns out that regardless of whether a

00:01:57.706 --> 00:01:59.539
is greater than b, or b is greater than a,

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:02.336
or they're equivalent,
that the absolute value

00:02:02.336 --> 00:02:06.523
of a minus b is equivalent
to the absolute value

00:02:06.523 --> 00:02:09.249
of b minus a, and this is equivalent,

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:11.243
either of these
expressions is the distance

00:02:11.243 --> 00:02:13.611
between these numbers.

00:02:13.611 --> 00:02:15.191
I encourage you to play
around with the negatives

00:02:15.191 --> 00:02:16.641
to see if you can factor
out some negatives

00:02:16.641 --> 00:02:18.075
and think about the absolute value.

00:02:18.075 --> 00:02:19.921
It will actually make a lot
of sense why this is true.

00:02:19.921 --> 00:02:21.402
In another video, I might
do a little bit more

00:02:21.402 --> 00:02:24.049
of a rigorous justification for it.

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:24.943
But I think the important thing

00:02:24.943 --> 00:02:26.765
for this video is to see that this

00:02:26.765 --> 00:02:30.085
is actually true.

00:02:30.085 --> 00:02:32.071
So let's say we're in a world,

00:02:32.071 --> 00:02:34.231
let's get a number line out,

00:02:34.231 --> 00:02:36.645
and let's look at some examples.

00:02:36.645 --> 00:02:38.850
So let's say that we want to figure out

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:41.893
the distance between,

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:45.830
between, let's say negative two,

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:48.245
the distance between negative two

00:02:48.245 --> 00:02:51.102
and positive three.

00:02:51.971 --> 00:02:53.820
So we can look at the number line

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:55.050
and figure out what that distance is.

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:57.762
To go from negative two to positive three,

00:02:57.762 --> 00:02:58.784
or the distance between them,

00:02:58.784 --> 00:03:02.040
we see is one, two, three, four, five.

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.072
Actually, let me draw
a straighter line here.

00:03:04.072 --> 00:03:06.475
This distance right over here,

00:03:06.475 --> 00:03:08.192
this distance right over here

00:03:08.192 --> 00:03:11.037
is equal to five.

00:03:11.037 --> 00:03:11.659
You see it right over here.

00:03:11.659 --> 00:03:15.212
One, two, three, four, five.

00:03:15.212 --> 00:03:17.173
Or you'd have to go five backwards

00:03:17.173 --> 00:03:19.391
to go from three to negative two.

00:03:19.391 --> 00:03:20.691
But let's see that what I just wrote

00:03:20.691 --> 00:03:23.049
actually applies right over here.

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:26.114
So if we took negative two to be our a

00:03:26.114 --> 00:03:27.796
and three to be our b,

00:03:27.796 --> 00:03:29.537
then we could write this as

00:03:29.537 --> 00:03:33.684
the absolute value of negative two

00:03:33.684 --> 00:03:37.648
minus three,

00:03:40.381 --> 00:03:42.540
what is this going to be equal to?

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:43.666
Well this is going to be equal

00:03:43.666 --> 00:03:47.594
to negative two minus
three is negative five,

00:03:47.594 --> 00:03:50.451
so it's the absolute
value of negative five.

00:03:50.451 --> 00:03:53.097
So this indeed equals five.

00:03:53.097 --> 00:03:55.118
So notice I subtracted the larger number

00:03:55.118 --> 00:03:56.928
from the smaller number.

00:03:56.928 --> 00:03:58.077
I got a negative value, but then I took

00:03:58.077 --> 00:03:59.552
the absolute value of it.

00:03:59.552 --> 00:04:01.258
That gave me the actual distance

00:04:01.258 --> 00:04:03.313
between these two numbers.

00:04:03.313 --> 00:04:05.333
Now what if I did it the other way around?

00:04:05.333 --> 00:04:09.652
What if I took three minus negative two?

00:04:09.652 --> 00:04:12.310
So it's going to be the absolute value

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:15.897
of three, let me do it in the blue color,

00:04:15.897 --> 00:04:20.388
the absolute value of three minus,

00:04:21.969 --> 00:04:24.722
and in parentheses I'll
write the negative two.

00:04:25.026 --> 00:04:26.187
Negative two.

00:04:26.187 --> 00:04:28.103
Now if you subtract a smaller number

00:04:28.103 --> 00:04:29.379
from a larger number, you should get

00:04:29.379 --> 00:04:30.425
a positive value.

00:04:30.425 --> 00:04:33.478
So the absolute value sign
here is just kind of extra.

00:04:33.478 --> 00:04:34.019
You don't really need it,

00:04:34.019 --> 00:04:35.855
unless to verify that that's true.

00:04:35.855 --> 00:04:38.756
This is going to be
three minus negative two.

00:04:38.756 --> 00:04:40.277
That's the same thing as three plus

00:04:40.277 --> 00:04:42.799
positive two, or five.

00:04:42.799 --> 00:04:44.008
So this is just going
to be the absolute value

00:04:44.008 --> 00:04:47.478
of five, which of
course, is equal to five.

00:04:47.478 --> 00:04:48.708
So hopefully this makes you feel good

00:04:48.708 --> 00:04:49.719
that if you want the distance

00:04:49.719 --> 00:04:51.728
between two numbers, you subtract one

00:04:51.728 --> 00:04:53.364
from the other, and it doesn't matter

00:04:53.364 --> 00:04:54.029
which order you do it.

00:04:54.029 --> 00:04:55.746
You could subtract
three from negative two,

00:04:55.746 --> 00:04:58.306
or negative two from three,

00:04:58.306 --> 00:05:00.105
be careful with the negative symbols here,

00:05:00.105 --> 00:05:01.684
and then take the absolute value,

00:05:01.684 --> 00:05:02.787
and then that is going to give you

00:05:02.787 --> 00:05:05.050
the distance between these two numbers.

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:06.862
This is super important because later

00:05:06.862 --> 00:05:08.128
in your mathematical careers,

00:05:08.128 --> 00:05:09.183
you're going to see a math professor

00:05:09.183 --> 00:05:11.402
just say, oh, you know,
I care about the distance

00:05:11.402 --> 00:05:13.480
between two variables, you know,

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:16.602
a and b, so the distance is a minus b,

00:05:16.602 --> 00:05:18.483
and then later they
might write it like this.

00:05:18.483 --> 00:05:19.505
And then to realize that these

00:05:19.505 --> 00:05:20.839
are actually the same thing,

00:05:20.839 --> 00:05:23.721
and these are gonna give the same value,

00:05:23.721 --> 00:05:25.358
and they represent the distance

00:05:25.358 --> 00:05:28.142
between these numbers.
