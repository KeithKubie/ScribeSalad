00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.825
Good morning,
all.

00:00:01.825 --> 00:00:06.550
Let's get going.
So I guess you had your quiz

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:11.597
review yesterday.
I hope you guys didn't beat up

00:00:11.597 --> 00:00:15.355
on (name of TA) and who else was
it?

00:00:15.355 --> 00:00:19.006
(Name of TA) too much.
As you know,

00:00:19.006 --> 00:00:24.483
the quiz is tomorrow.
And unfortunately MIT couldn't

00:00:24.483 --> 00:00:32.000
give us one big room so we are
broken up into three rooms.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.751
And you will go to your room
based on the first letter of

00:00:38.751 --> 00:00:44.056
your last name.
OK, so today we shall cover a

00:00:44.056 --> 00:00:49.000
topic called "Large Signal
Analysis".

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.226
So in the last couple lectures
we looked at one dependent

00:01:04.226 --> 00:01:08.239
sources abstractly,
and then we looked at an

00:01:08.239 --> 00:01:12.813
amplifier built using a
practical dependent source

00:01:12.813 --> 00:01:16.826
called the MOSFET.
Now, the MOSFET had to be

00:01:16.826 --> 00:01:22.519
operated in a given region of
its operation in order to behave

00:01:22.519 --> 00:01:27.093
like a current source.
And while it behaved like a

00:01:27.093 --> 00:01:31.760
current source you would get
amplification or a FET

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:36.136
amplifier.
So that was in the past two

00:01:36.136 --> 00:01:39.223
lectures.
What you are going to do today

00:01:39.223 --> 00:01:43.812
is called large signal analysis,
and this is a loaded term.

00:01:43.812 --> 00:01:48.561
So large signal analysis means
something very specific in our

00:01:48.561 --> 00:01:52.122
business, and I will describe to
what that is.

00:01:52.122 --> 00:01:56.395
This analysis involves looking
at a circuit containing,

00:01:56.395 --> 00:01:59.640
for example,
a MOSFET and figuring out how

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:04.705
to get that device to operate in
a way that the MOSFET was always

00:02:04.705 --> 00:02:08.969
in saturation.
So you had to figure out,

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:12.278
based on parameters that you
could control,

00:02:12.278 --> 00:02:16.375
how to establish those
parameters so that the circuit

00:02:16.375 --> 00:02:20.945
operated in a way that the
MOSFET was always in saturation.

00:02:20.945 --> 00:02:23.939
So large signal analysis
involves that.

00:02:23.939 --> 00:02:27.721
And although the examples we
use, use the MOSFET,

00:02:27.721 --> 00:02:33.000
the same kind of analysis can
apply to any other device.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.175
Remember, your MOSFET is a
primitive element that we use as

00:02:37.175 --> 00:02:40.848
an example in this course.
There are other primitive

00:02:40.848 --> 00:02:43.943
elements that you can use.
The course notes,

00:02:43.943 --> 00:02:46.536
for example,
discusses a couple other

00:02:46.536 --> 00:02:49.127
devices.
One is the "bipolar junction

00:02:49.127 --> 00:02:52.656
transistor", the BJT,
and works through a complete

00:02:52.656 --> 00:02:56.976
example from start to finish
involving a circuit containing a

00:02:56.976 --> 00:03:02.000
bipolar junction transistor.
And you can do a large signal

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.206
analysis of that device as well.
It turns out that you need to

00:03:06.206 --> 00:03:09.655
operate that device in an
interesting region of its

00:03:09.655 --> 00:03:12.827
operating space,
and so you can conduct a large

00:03:12.827 --> 00:03:16.551
signal analysis of a circuit
containing that device and

00:03:16.551 --> 00:03:19.517
figure out how best to operate
that circuit.

00:03:19.517 --> 00:03:22.965
So that is large signal
analysis, and we will do an

00:03:22.965 --> 00:03:28.000
example and explain how this is
done using an example today.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:34.690
So to quickly review where we
have been so far,

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:40.363
we looked at this little
structure here,

00:03:40.363 --> 00:03:44.000
our MOSFET amplifier.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.703
Notice that when I write a
voltage at a node,

00:03:53.703 --> 00:03:57.206
that's a short form for saying
I am looking at the voltage

00:03:57.206 --> 00:04:00.832
between the ground node and the
node at which the voltage is

00:04:00.832 --> 00:04:04.445
written down.
So VO here and VI applied here.

00:04:04.445 --> 00:04:07.758
This is a very,
very common circuit that we

00:04:07.758 --> 00:04:10.282
use.
To emphasize one more point,

00:04:10.282 --> 00:04:14.857
in general, in the kind of
circuits we look at both in this

00:04:14.857 --> 00:04:19.038
course and in real life,
there are a few patterns that

00:04:19.038 --> 00:04:23.218
we use very commonly that keep
repeating all the time.

00:04:23.218 --> 00:04:27.162
Very often you don't have to
look at every possible

00:04:27.162 --> 00:04:33.000
permutation and combination of
how things could be connected.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.759
This sort of connecting thing
is very, very,

00:04:36.759 --> 00:04:40.431
very common.
And you will see a lot of this

00:04:40.431 --> 00:04:43.229
pattern.
And we do the equivalent

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:47.163
circuit for this.
In the equivalent circuit we

00:04:47.163 --> 00:04:51.972
replace the MOSFET with a
dependent source provided this

00:04:51.972 --> 00:04:54.857
operated in the saturation
region.

00:04:54.857 --> 00:04:59.579
So I will just say while
operating under saturation the

00:04:59.579 --> 00:05:03.338
equivalent circuit would look
like this, VO,

00:05:03.338 --> 00:05:05.000
VI.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:22.399
And IDS for the dependent
source was given by K/2

00:05:22.399 --> 00:05:27.393
(VI-VT)^2.
So this was an amplifier.

00:05:27.393 --> 00:05:32.659
Here was the equivalent circuit
while this device was in

00:05:32.659 --> 00:05:36.521
saturation.
And to operate in saturation,

00:05:36.521 --> 00:05:41.826
I said that certain properties
need to be true for the MOSFET.

00:05:41.826 --> 00:05:47.043
And there are two properties
that need to be true for this to

00:05:47.043 --> 00:05:52.000
be operating in saturation.
One is that its gate to source

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:57.565
voltage needs to be greater than
VT, so VGS for the MOSFET should

00:05:57.565 --> 00:06:02.783
be greater than VT.
And the second one was that the

00:06:02.783 --> 00:06:07.902
output voltage needed to be
greater than the input voltage

00:06:07.902 --> 00:06:12.662
minus one threshold drop.
And this was the same as VDS

00:06:12.662 --> 00:06:16.524
for the MOSFET,
this was the same as VGS for

00:06:16.524 --> 00:06:20.026
the MOSFET.
So what are we really saying

00:06:20.026 --> 00:06:22.810
here?
What we are saying is that

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:26.582
look, we built this circuit
using a MOSFET,

00:06:26.582 --> 00:06:32.060
and it is up to us as engineers
to choose its operating points

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:37.000
in a way that these two
properties hold.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.138
For example,
to make the first condition

00:06:41.138 --> 00:06:47.717
true, I can discipline myself to
operate such that VI is always

00:06:47.717 --> 00:06:52.279
greater than VT.
Similarly, I can choose VS,

00:06:52.279 --> 00:06:57.160
RL and VI in a way that this
condition is true,

00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:03.421
which says that the drain to
source voltage across my MOSFET

00:07:03.421 --> 00:07:10.000
drain and source should be
greater than VI minus VT.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:15.890
As an example,
if VI was 2 volts and VT was,

00:07:15.890 --> 00:07:21.506
say, 1 volt,
then what I am saying is that

00:07:21.506 --> 00:07:30.000
VO should be greater than or
equal to 2 minus 1 or 1 volt.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:35.109
So I need to keep this high,
2, 3, 4, 5, whatever,

00:07:35.109 --> 00:07:40.426
a high voltage so that this guy
stays in saturation.

00:07:40.426 --> 00:07:46.473
The relevant readings for the
material that we are going to

00:07:46.473 --> 00:07:52.000
cover in the course notes are in
7.5.1 and 7.6.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.640
So that is pretty much a review
of where we were.

00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:03.294
We said we could build an
amplifier.

00:08:03.294 --> 00:08:06.707
Its equivalent circuit was
shown on the right.

00:08:06.707 --> 00:08:10.424
And, provided that,
I discipline myself to operate

00:08:10.424 --> 00:08:15.126
in the saturation region or to
have the MOSFET operating in the

00:08:15.126 --> 00:08:18.615
saturation region,
then this would work like an

00:08:18.615 --> 00:08:22.103
amplifier and all would be good
with the world.

00:08:22.103 --> 00:08:24.000
So today --

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.428
-- we look at large signal
analysis of a circuit.

00:08:33.428 --> 00:08:37.428
And an example would be this
circuit up here containing a

00:08:37.428 --> 00:08:39.785
MOSFET.
And, again, as I mentioned

00:08:39.785 --> 00:08:43.928
earlier, a large signal analysis
is a loaded term in 6.002,

00:08:43.928 --> 00:08:47.928
or for that matter in circuits.
And large signal analysis

00:08:47.928 --> 00:08:50.000
involves two steps.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:00.121
The first step involves writing
down the transfer function of

00:09:00.121 --> 00:09:02.932
your little circuit.
In our case,

00:09:02.932 --> 00:09:05.496
VO is the output,
VI is the input,

00:09:05.496 --> 00:09:08.370
so involves writing down VO
versus VI.

00:09:08.370 --> 00:09:11.401
Simply write down the transfer
function.

00:09:11.401 --> 00:09:14.741
In other words,
the relationship between the

00:09:14.741 --> 00:09:17.616
output and the input for that
circuit.

00:09:17.616 --> 00:09:20.802
And, in our case,
again, we've disciplined

00:09:20.802 --> 00:09:24.686
ourselves to adhere to the
"saturation discipline".

00:09:24.686 --> 00:09:29.192
And the second part of large
signal analysis is to find out

00:09:29.192 --> 00:09:33.000
the valid input operating range.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:42.725
Find out for the given circuit
parameters, let's say I apply a

00:09:42.725 --> 00:09:46.908
VS and I use some value of RL
and I use a given MOSFET,

00:09:46.908 --> 00:09:51.556
which has a given value of VT.
The question then is that what

00:09:51.556 --> 00:09:56.359
is a valid set of input voltages
that would operate the circuit

00:09:56.359 --> 00:10:00.000
in a way that I would be in
saturation.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:06.000
And so find out the valid input
range, and this would give me a

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000
corresponding output range --

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.925
-- for saturation operation of
the MOSFET.

00:10:19.925 --> 00:10:25.000
That is what we will dwell on
in the lecture today.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:34.626
So what we are saying here is
that if I am careful with how I

00:10:34.626 --> 00:10:39.562
apply VI for a given value of RL
and VS and for a given choice of

00:10:39.562 --> 00:10:44.111
my MOS transistor then I can
stay within saturation provided

00:10:44.111 --> 00:10:46.888
I select my input voltages
carefully.

00:10:46.888 --> 00:10:51.592
And the analysis that we will
go through today will figure out

00:10:51.592 --> 00:10:54.368
what that range of input
voltages is.

00:10:54.368 --> 00:10:58.300
And, again, I will use this as
a motivating example,

00:10:58.300 --> 00:11:02.787
the MOSFET amplifier.
But in general large signal

00:11:02.787 --> 00:11:06.031
analysis would apply to any
other circuit as well.

00:11:06.031 --> 00:11:08.614
For example,
in recitation you may learn

00:11:08.614 --> 00:11:11.262
about other circuits containing
a MOSFET.

00:11:11.262 --> 00:11:14.904
And you can do a large signal
analysis of other circuits

00:11:14.904 --> 00:11:19.009
containing a MOSFET or you might
learn about some other devices

00:11:19.009 --> 00:11:22.783
like the bipolar junction
transistor, and you could do the

00:11:22.783 --> 00:11:25.232
same kind of analysis for that
device.

00:11:25.232 --> 00:11:30.000
So remember that the MOSFET
amplifier here is an example.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:34.027
I will be using that as a
driving example to explain large

00:11:34.027 --> 00:11:36.430
signal analysis.
So the first step,

00:11:36.430 --> 00:11:39.963
as I mentioned earlier,
is to get the VO versus VI.

00:11:39.963 --> 00:11:44.274
And in general for some circuit
that you build the output will

00:11:44.274 --> 00:11:47.665
not even be a voltage.
There are certain circuits

00:11:47.665 --> 00:11:51.057
where the output might be some
kind of a current.

00:11:51.057 --> 00:11:55.226
Let's say I am building some
kind of a circuit where I would

00:11:55.226 --> 00:11:59.608
like the output current or the
current through some edge of the

00:11:59.608 --> 00:12:04.928
circuit to depend on some input.
In that case the transfer

00:12:04.928 --> 00:12:08.477
function would be the output
current versus VI.

00:12:08.477 --> 00:12:13.105
And if I had an input current
here it would be output current

00:12:13.105 --> 00:12:16.885
versus input current,
you know, whatever the given

00:12:16.885 --> 00:12:20.665
problem tells you.
So this is under the saturation

00:12:20.665 --> 00:12:23.674
discipline.
And I will not rederive this

00:12:23.674 --> 00:12:26.142
for you.
You can apply a good old

00:12:26.142 --> 00:12:30.000
technique like the analytical
method.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.211
Or you can use the graphical
method to get the appropriate

00:12:34.211 --> 00:12:37.018
answer here.
I wanted to point out in a

00:12:37.018 --> 00:12:41.155
quick aside that why do we care
about graphical analysis?

00:12:41.155 --> 00:12:45.366
Once you have the analytical
method, why do you care about

00:12:45.366 --> 00:12:48.691
the graphical method?
And a student asked me a

00:12:48.691 --> 00:12:52.976
question after lecture last
Thursday, and it occurred to me

00:12:52.976 --> 00:12:58.000
that it's not obvious why you
need the graphical method.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.791
So it turns out that often
times you do not have an

00:13:01.791 --> 00:13:05.127
equation describing the device.
So let's say,

00:13:05.127 --> 00:13:07.554
for example,
I am a manufacturer.

00:13:07.554 --> 00:13:10.815
Let's say I am AMD.
As AMD I sit down and my

00:13:10.815 --> 00:13:13.696
semiconductor division builds a
MOSFET.

00:13:13.696 --> 00:13:17.639
And when you build a MOSFET
your experiments and your

00:13:17.639 --> 00:13:22.189
fabrication division often times
doesn't give you an equation

00:13:22.189 --> 00:13:25.601
with the MOSFET.
They build something and then

00:13:25.601 --> 00:13:30.000
you look at it and you
experiment with it.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.237
You apply various input
voltages and you measure

00:13:33.237 --> 00:13:35.855
currents and output voltages and
so on.

00:13:35.855 --> 00:13:39.919
And so what you end up getting
is a graph that describes the

00:13:39.919 --> 00:13:43.570
behavior of the MOSFET.
And you have seen this in your

00:13:43.570 --> 00:13:46.256
lab as well, your 2N7000 or was
it 2000?

00:13:46.256 --> 00:13:47.634
7000.
So your 2N7000,

00:13:47.634 --> 00:13:51.560
the MOSFET you use in the lab
also gives you a data sheet.

00:13:51.560 --> 00:13:54.866
And in that data sheet you see
a bunch of curves.

00:13:54.866 --> 00:13:59.000
So very often devices come with
data sheets.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:03.278
And when you have a data sheet
but no equation then you can

00:14:03.278 --> 00:14:06.967
apply the graphical method and
solve your circuits.

00:14:06.967 --> 00:14:09.918
In this example,
assuming I can apply the

00:14:09.918 --> 00:14:13.459
analytical method,
here was the expression that I

00:14:13.459 --> 00:14:17.000
had derived for you in the last
lecture.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:30.000
So VO was related to VI using
the square law relationship.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:38.106
And we can plot and do other
fun stuff with this equation.

00:14:38.106 --> 00:14:42.515
So here is the input voltage
VI.

00:14:42.515 --> 00:14:47.919
That is my VT.
So notice that VO is VS.

00:14:47.919 --> 00:14:55.600
This is true when VI greater
than or equal to VT and VO

00:14:55.600 --> 00:15:02.000
greater than or equal to VI
minus VT.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:07.580
So these are the constraints of
the saturation discipline.

00:15:07.580 --> 00:15:13.650
And in our particular situation
when VI was less than VT output

00:15:13.650 --> 00:15:17.958
would simply be VS.
If VI is less than VT the

00:15:17.958 --> 00:15:23.146
MOSFET would turn off,
switch off, and I would have no

00:15:23.146 --> 00:15:28.335
current flowing through RL,
and VS would appear at the

00:15:28.335 --> 00:15:31.127
output.
So until VT,

00:15:31.127 --> 00:15:36.201
I have VS, and then following
that I get the square law

00:15:36.201 --> 00:15:39.677
behavior articulated by this
equation.

00:15:39.677 --> 00:15:44.000
And this was simply VS-K/2
(VI-VT)(RL^2).

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:03.347
So that's the first part.
You have seen this before.

00:16:03.347 --> 00:16:09.914
The transfer function shows
that I have a square law

00:16:09.914 --> 00:16:16.995
dependence between VI and VO.
So now I can embark on the

00:16:16.995 --> 00:16:24.978
second step of my large signal
analysis, and my goal is to find

00:16:24.978 --> 00:16:32.571
the valid input operating range.
So what does that mean?

00:16:32.571 --> 00:16:38.833
What I am looking to do here
is, for this little circuit,

00:16:38.833 --> 00:16:42.188
is drain, source,
gate, VI, VO,

00:16:42.188 --> 00:16:46.773
RL and VS.
What I am looking to do is that

00:16:46.773 --> 00:16:52.252
given the value of the supply
VS, RL and a MOSFET,

00:16:52.252 --> 00:16:58.738
in our case given a MOSFET
implies that it is a given value

00:16:58.738 --> 00:17:05.000
of K and a given value of VT for
that MOSFET.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:09.646
So what I am going to do is
find out, let's assume VI is my

00:17:09.646 --> 00:17:13.571
free variable here.
So my goal will be to find out

00:17:13.571 --> 00:17:18.138
the range of VI for which this
device stays in saturation.

00:17:18.138 --> 00:17:21.743
And I will use a couple of
methods to do that,

00:17:21.743 --> 00:17:25.508
and I will use both a
combination of a graphical

00:17:25.508 --> 00:17:30.475
method to give you intuition and
then apply analytical analysis

00:17:30.475 --> 00:17:36.633
to get down to specific answers.
So let's start with the

00:17:36.633 --> 00:17:39.954
intuitive part.
So here is VI,

00:17:39.954 --> 00:17:43.618
VO.
I will use the transfer curve

00:17:43.618 --> 00:17:49.000
VO versus VI to help build
intuition here.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:03.349
So that is what it looks like.
So the first step,

00:18:03.349 --> 00:18:07.971
looking at this graph,
we know that this point here,

00:18:07.971 --> 00:18:12.956
that VI needs to be greater
than VT to satisfy the first

00:18:12.956 --> 00:18:16.218
equation.
Let me just write down both

00:18:16.218 --> 00:18:20.296
equations here.
So VI greater than or equal to

00:18:20.296 --> 00:18:24.737
VT is one of them,
and VO is greater than VI minus

00:18:24.737 --> 00:18:31.394
VT is a second equation.
And just remember that this is

00:18:31.394 --> 00:18:36.259
the same as VDS and this is the
same as VGS.

00:18:36.259 --> 00:18:42.481
So VI must be greater than VT
for the MOSFET to turn on.

00:18:42.481 --> 00:18:48.817
And so therefore the valid
operating range starts at this

00:18:48.817 --> 00:18:55.379
point and is somewhere up here.
So the first part is pretty

00:18:55.379 --> 00:18:59.000
easy.
Somewhere here --

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:02.659
Somewhere at that point,
my output voltage VO.

00:19:02.659 --> 00:19:05.668
I'm not quite sure what that
point is.

00:19:05.668 --> 00:19:09.571
My output voltage VO,
as this keeps falling down,

00:19:09.571 --> 00:19:14.369
my output voltage VO goes lower
than one threshold below VI.

00:19:14.369 --> 00:19:18.272
And at that point it goes into
its triode region,

00:19:18.272 --> 00:19:21.606
and I need to find out what
that point is.

00:19:21.606 --> 00:19:26.567
So somewhere here I go into my
triode region and begin to show

00:19:26.567 --> 00:19:30.632
a different behavior than the
amplifying square law

00:19:30.632 --> 00:19:36.000
relationship there and go into
my triode behavior.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:39.797
So I need to find out what this
point is.

00:19:39.797 --> 00:19:45.493
Once I find out what that point
is then this will be my valid

00:19:45.493 --> 00:19:49.765
operating range.
So let's figure out what that

00:19:49.765 --> 00:19:53.468
point is.
At that point the following is

00:19:53.468 --> 00:19:56.601
true.
Certainly VI is greater than

00:19:56.601 --> 00:19:59.544
VT.
And at that point the output

00:19:59.544 --> 00:20:06.000
goes below one threshold,
the input minus one threshold.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:13.673
So at this point the following
is true, VO is equal to VI minus

00:20:13.673 --> 00:20:17.014
VT.
At that point the output

00:20:17.014 --> 00:20:21.717
voltage is equal to the input
minus VT.

00:20:21.717 --> 00:20:28.277
And if the output goes lower
then it will violate this

00:20:28.277 --> 00:20:33.829
equation here.
It is no longer greater than

00:20:33.829 --> 00:20:38.174
that number.
So how do we find out what this

00:20:38.174 --> 00:20:41.508
point is?
The principle intuition.

00:20:41.508 --> 00:20:47.369
Let's draw some lines here.
Let's assume that VI and VT use

00:20:47.369 --> 00:20:49.996
the same scale,
say, volts.

00:20:49.996 --> 00:20:56.261
So if I draw a straight line at
45 degrees then that is a curve

00:20:56.261 --> 00:21:01.876
representing VI equals VO.
We all know that.

00:21:01.876 --> 00:21:06.732
No big shakes.
So the line at 45 degrees here

00:21:06.732 --> 00:21:10.264
is the line at which VI equal
VO.

00:21:10.264 --> 00:21:15.782
And if I take that line now,
the VI equals VO line,

00:21:15.782 --> 00:21:20.086
and I begin translating it to
the right.

00:21:20.086 --> 00:21:25.605
So let's take a line here.
Let's take a line there.

00:21:25.605 --> 00:21:33.000
That line will be simply equal
to VO equals VI minus VT.

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:36.295
I have translated that to the
right.

00:21:36.295 --> 00:21:40.814
And so this line is simply VO
equals VI minus VT.

00:21:40.814 --> 00:21:46.087
So this line is a locus of
points at which VO is equal to

00:21:46.087 --> 00:21:49.665
this value.
This minus VT shows up as a

00:21:49.665 --> 00:21:54.938
translation to the right.
So I take my VO equals VI line,

00:21:54.938 --> 00:22:00.587
translate that to the right and
it becomes VO equals VI minus

00:22:00.587 --> 00:22:05.673
VT.
Elementary geometry 101 or

00:22:05.673 --> 00:22:10.336
whatever.
So what do we have here?

00:22:10.336 --> 00:22:17.402
Above this we have the
condition VO greater than or

00:22:17.402 --> 00:22:24.608
equal to VI minus VT,
and below that we have VO less

00:22:24.608 --> 00:22:31.258
than VI minus VT.
If we look at this graph here,

00:22:31.258 --> 00:22:35.495
this is the valid input
operating range.

00:22:35.495 --> 00:22:41.904
Starting at this point greater
than VT, and at this point my

00:22:41.904 --> 00:22:45.706
output equals VO equals VI minus
VT.

00:22:45.706 --> 00:22:51.246
This must be the valid
operating range for the input

00:22:51.246 --> 00:22:56.025
here to here.
And correspondingly the outputs

00:22:56.025 --> 00:23:02.000
are from here to this point to
here like so.

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:06.610
So this is my valid input
operating range and this is my

00:23:06.610 --> 00:23:11.724
valid output operating range or
the corresponding valid output

00:23:11.724 --> 00:23:14.910
operating range.
So what does this say?

00:23:14.910 --> 00:23:19.520
What this is saying is that if
I, as the designer of the

00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:24.718
circuit, am disciplined enough
to apply inputs that are in this

00:23:24.718 --> 00:23:30.000
range, VT to some value here,
graphically shown here.

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:34.502
Then my MOSFET will remain in
saturation.

00:23:34.502 --> 00:23:40.917
And correspondingly my outputs
will go between VS and some

00:23:40.917 --> 00:23:45.194
value here.
So hopefully that gives you

00:23:45.194 --> 00:23:49.922
some of the intuition behind how
we get it.

00:23:49.922 --> 00:23:56.000
And let's continue.
Let me label this point X.

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:09.821
So continuing with two to get
the valid operating range.

00:24:09.821 --> 00:24:14.901
I have shown you intuitively
where that point is,

00:24:14.901 --> 00:24:20.828
but what I will do next is
actually compute that for you.

00:24:20.828 --> 00:24:24.321
It is a pretty simple
computation.

00:24:24.321 --> 00:24:29.930
Note that point X is the
intersection of two curves VO

00:24:29.930 --> 00:24:36.673
equals VI minus VT.
And the second curve is VO

00:24:36.673 --> 00:24:44.728
equals VS minus K divide by 2,
VI minus V2 all squared RL.

00:24:44.728 --> 00:24:52.358
So the point X iss at the
intersection of these curves,

00:24:52.358 --> 00:24:59.000
and I can very easily get that
as follows.

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:06.185
What I will do is I will simply
substitute for VI minus VT from

00:25:06.185 --> 00:25:10.821
this equation here and then
solve for it,

00:25:10.821 --> 00:25:17.195
so I get VO equals VS minus K
divide by 2 VO squared RL.

00:25:17.195 --> 00:25:21.599
And so this gives me a
quadratic in VO.

00:25:21.599 --> 00:25:25.771
And I can solve for it pretty
easily.

00:25:25.771 --> 00:25:34.000
And I get for a quadratic AX
squared plus BX plus C equals 0.

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:38.844
The solution is given by VO is
minus B plus/minus square root

00:25:38.844 --> 00:25:41.751
of B squared minus 4AC divided
by 2A.

00:25:41.751 --> 00:25:45.627
And so I am just going to get
those numbers here.

00:25:45.627 --> 00:25:49.422
So the coefficient of VO,
that is B, is minus 1.

00:25:49.422 --> 00:25:53.863
Take the positive root because
we are up in the positive

00:25:53.863 --> 00:25:57.335
voltages here.
And square root of B squared,

00:25:57.335 --> 00:26:06.578
that is 1, minus 4AC.
So I get a plus 4 times K

00:26:06.578 --> 00:26:17.368
divide by 2 RL.
And 2A is simply 2 times K

00:26:17.368 --> 00:26:30.000
divided by 2 times RL.
So that is what I get.

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:35.106
That gives me VO.
So it tells me that VO,

00:26:35.106 --> 00:26:42.638
at the point where the output
just equals one threshold drop

00:26:42.638 --> 00:26:50.170
below VI is given by the other
circuit perimeter such as VS,

00:26:50.170 --> 00:26:55.276
RL and so on.
Oh, I am missing a VS here.

00:26:55.276 --> 00:27:02.655
I just forgot the VS up here.
That is my VO.

00:27:02.655 --> 00:27:12.706
So what is VI equal to?
Remember that at this point VO

00:27:12.706 --> 00:27:22.000
equals VI minus VT,
so VI is simply VT plus --

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:43.430
I have not taught you anything
earth shattering here.

00:27:43.430 --> 00:27:47.125
I have just done some grubby
math here to solve these two

00:27:47.125 --> 00:27:49.697
equations.
So this is a straight line at

00:27:49.697 --> 00:27:53.128
45 degrees from VT and this is
the transfer function.

00:27:53.128 --> 00:27:55.437
And I need to find the
intersection.

00:27:55.437 --> 00:27:59.000
And the intersection is given
by this point.

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:10.150
So that point,
VI being VT plus something,

00:28:10.150 --> 00:28:15.849
is simply the second dot on the
X axis.

00:28:15.849 --> 00:28:20.950
So therefore I am pretty much
done.

00:28:20.950 --> 00:28:28.000
My valid input range for VI
goes from VT.

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:32.674
So it starts at VT.
That is where the transistor

00:28:32.674 --> 00:28:36.852
just turns on.
And then goes all the way to

00:28:36.852 --> 00:28:43.118
this point, VT plus minus 1 plus
square root of 1 plus 2 K RL VS

00:28:43.118 --> 00:28:46.500
K RL.
So this is my valid operating

00:28:46.500 --> 00:28:49.682
range.
And again remember I won't

00:28:49.682 --> 00:28:54.158
dwell on this equation because,
in some sense,

00:28:54.158 --> 00:28:59.728
you will get a different set of
limits for other devices,

00:28:59.728 --> 00:29:05.000
for other circuits containing a
MOSFET.

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:08.529
Or, for that matter,
for other outputs that one may

00:29:08.529 --> 00:29:11.705
be focusing on.
So what is more important here

00:29:11.705 --> 00:29:16.011
is not so much the results that
you see but the process that I

00:29:16.011 --> 00:29:19.400
have gone through.
So what is more important here

00:29:19.400 --> 00:29:22.788
is how did I get here?
And the way I got here was

00:29:22.788 --> 00:29:26.317
looked at the graph and said
look, the MOSFET is in

00:29:26.317 --> 00:29:31.590
saturation in that regime.
And I am finding the bounding

00:29:31.590 --> 00:29:35.521
points of the regime of
saturation operation.

00:29:35.521 --> 00:29:39.272
So now, as an engineer,
I can say that hey,

00:29:39.272 --> 00:29:43.114
look, if you build a MOSFET
circuit like so,

00:29:43.114 --> 00:29:48.027
with a given value of RL,
a given MOSFET and a given VS,

00:29:48.027 --> 00:29:52.851
then if you limit yourself you
are operating with input

00:29:52.851 --> 00:29:56.602
voltages in this range thou
shalt be happy.

00:29:56.602 --> 00:30:01.694
If you go beyond that range
then you will be violating the

00:30:01.694 --> 00:30:07.250
saturation discipline.
So the corresponding output

00:30:07.250 --> 00:30:08.000
range --

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:22.877
I can write the corresponding
output range,

00:30:22.877 --> 00:30:28.567
and that goes from VS,
when the input is at VT the

00:30:28.567 --> 00:30:36.000
output is at VS and goes from VS
down to the input minus VT.

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:39.000
Which is simply minus 1 plus --

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:55.022
Let me go back and quickly show
you a little MOSFET circuit,

00:30:55.022 --> 00:30:58.977
amplified circuit so you can
stare at a real transfer curve

00:30:58.977 --> 00:31:03.396
yourselves.
And indeed convince yourselves

00:31:03.396 --> 00:31:10.075
that roughly at the point where
proportionately shown in the

00:31:10.075 --> 00:31:17.207
curve up there the MOSFET indeed
goes into its triode region and

00:31:17.207 --> 00:31:22.075
begins heading out of its
saturation region.

00:31:22.075 --> 00:31:27.962
Notice that here that is the
same curve, the transfer

00:31:27.962 --> 00:31:32.788
function.
And the amplified output is at

00:31:32.788 --> 00:31:36.971
VS until input reaches a
threshold voltage VT.

00:31:36.971 --> 00:31:41.991
And once input goes beyond VT
the output begins to drop

00:31:41.991 --> 00:31:45.802
precipitously.
And at some point here this

00:31:45.802 --> 00:31:49.056
begins to go into its triode
region.

00:31:49.056 --> 00:31:53.983
And what I am going to do is
simply increase the input

00:31:53.983 --> 00:31:59.374
voltage VI, and you will see
that the output them begins to

00:31:59.374 --> 00:32:05.108
go into its triode region.
It keeps dropping.

00:32:05.108 --> 00:32:10.963
And, as you can see,
the output begins to go into a

00:32:10.963 --> 00:32:16.234
space where the gain is no
longer more than 1.

00:32:16.234 --> 00:32:21.738
And this is a triode region of
MOSFET operation.

00:32:21.738 --> 00:32:29.000
So the MOSFET is in saturation,
things are going great.

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:35.021
As I increase my VI notice at
some point I begin to go out of

00:32:35.021 --> 00:32:38.433
my saturation region of the
MOSFET.

00:32:38.433 --> 00:32:43.752
And somewhere here I go from
the saturation region and

00:32:43.752 --> 00:32:47.064
transition into the triode
region.

00:32:47.064 --> 00:32:52.885
And this value shown here gives
you the corresponding input

00:32:52.885 --> 00:32:59.021
voltage and the output voltage.
Other practical devices like

00:32:59.021 --> 00:33:03.425
bipolar junction transistors or
MOSFETs and other circuits and

00:33:03.425 --> 00:33:06.602
so on can be subjected to a
similar analysis.

00:33:06.602 --> 00:33:10.646
And you can find out the valid
operating regions for that

00:33:10.646 --> 00:33:13.173
device as well,
or for that circuit.

00:33:13.173 --> 00:33:17.000
So as a next step what I would
like to do --

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:25.875
Out here I began by looking at
the transfer function,

00:33:25.875 --> 00:33:29.527
the VO versus VI curve,
and used that to drive the

00:33:29.527 --> 00:33:34.000
intuition behind how we
calculated the bounding regions.

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:38.533
You can do the same kind of
analysis intuitively looking at

00:33:38.533 --> 00:33:42.285
yet another curve,
another set of graphs that you

00:33:42.285 --> 00:33:45.490
are familiar with,
and that is a load line

00:33:45.490 --> 00:33:48.851
characteristic.
And it is interesting to get

00:33:48.851 --> 00:33:52.681
two interpretations.
And you can use whichever one

00:33:52.681 --> 00:33:57.059
you feel comfortable with.
So I will do two alternatively

00:33:57.059 --> 00:34:01.514
and show you another set of
curves that you can use to get

00:34:01.514 --> 00:34:03.000
that.

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:16.311
Here I am going to plot IDS
versus VDS, which is the same as

00:34:16.311 --> 00:34:19.627
VO.
This was the load line graph

00:34:19.627 --> 00:34:25.297
that we had seen earlier.
And, just for our reference,

00:34:25.297 --> 00:34:31.074
remember that VI must be
greater than VT for saturation

00:34:31.074 --> 00:34:35.802
operation.
Similarly VO should be greater

00:34:35.802 --> 00:34:40.754
than or equal to VI minus VT for
saturation operation.

00:34:40.754 --> 00:34:45.238
Those are my limits.
The way we got the load line

00:34:45.238 --> 00:34:50.470
graph was we superimposed the
load line equation over the

00:34:50.470 --> 00:34:55.328
device characteristics.
And so let me plot the device

00:34:55.328 --> 00:35:00.000
characteristics in the
saturation region.

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:06.486
Remember that this constraint
could be related to the current

00:35:06.486 --> 00:35:12.000
as I derived for you in the last
lecture as follows.

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:18.162
IDS being less than or equal to
K divided by 2 VO squared.

00:35:18.162 --> 00:35:22.594
So in terms of my IDS versus
VDS relation,

00:35:22.594 --> 00:35:28.432
this lateral constraint is
equivalent to IDS being less

00:35:28.432 --> 00:35:35.225
than K by 2 VO squared.
So this is that equation.

00:35:35.225 --> 00:35:40.903
So this line is IDS equals K by
2 VO squared.

00:35:40.903 --> 00:35:48.774
And in this region I have the
valid operating region where IDS

00:35:48.774 --> 00:35:56.129
is less than that quality.
So here are all my other curves

00:35:56.129 --> 00:36:02.535
for various values VGS.
So here are my devices curves,

00:36:02.535 --> 00:36:06.422
IDS versus VDS.
Remember that these curves come

00:36:06.422 --> 00:36:08.957
down like this,
for the MOSFET,

00:36:08.957 --> 00:36:11.577
right?
Just that we focus on the

00:36:11.577 --> 00:36:16.056
right-hand side because that is
where the MOSFET is in

00:36:16.056 --> 00:36:19.521
saturation.
And on this side the MOSFET is

00:36:19.521 --> 00:36:23.915
in its triode region,
and we discipline ourselves not

00:36:23.915 --> 00:36:30.000
to operate the MOSFET such that
it is in its triode region.

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:34.356
So those were the device
characteristics.

00:36:34.356 --> 00:36:39.039
And then I could plot my load
line equation.

00:36:39.039 --> 00:36:42.960
My load line equation,
if you recall,

00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:48.514
was IDS = VS/RL - VO/RL.
This was simply obtained by

00:36:48.514 --> 00:36:54.287
writing KVL at the loop
containing the output node and

00:36:54.287 --> 00:36:58.970
the supply VS.
Notice there that VO is equal

00:36:58.970 --> 00:37:06.000
to VS minus IDS times RL.
And that is simply by dividing

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:12.199
by RL on both sides and moving
IDS to the left-hand side we get

00:37:12.199 --> 00:37:16.699
this equation.
And this equation gives rise to

00:37:16.699 --> 00:37:22.400
a curve that looks like this.
And what is this point here?

00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:27.699
This point is where VO is 0.
So when VO is 0 my IDS is

00:37:27.699 --> 00:37:34.596
simply VS divided by RL.
And this point is obtained when

00:37:34.596 --> 00:37:39.003
IDS is 0.
And under those conditions VS

00:37:39.003 --> 00:37:45.847
and VO are equal so this is VS.
This is my saturation region

00:37:45.847 --> 00:37:52.576
and this is the triode region.
This was another interesting

00:37:52.576 --> 00:37:56.635
graph.
We often times fondly call it

00:37:56.635 --> 00:38:01.732
the load line graph.
So here is a load line

00:38:01.732 --> 00:38:06.300
superimposed on the MOSFET
device IDS versus VDS curves for

00:38:06.300 --> 00:38:10.632
a variety of values of VGS.
So by looking at this curve,

00:38:10.632 --> 00:38:14.727
we can also intuitively
determine the valid operating

00:38:14.727 --> 00:38:17.248
range.
So what are the two points

00:38:17.248 --> 00:38:20.004
here?
I will let you stare at it for

00:38:20.004 --> 00:38:24.651
a couple of seconds yourselves
to figure out what two points

00:38:24.651 --> 00:38:28.589
here bound the valid operating
range of the MOSFET,

00:38:28.589 --> 00:38:33.000
the valid operating range of
the circuit.

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:36.839
I will start.
One is this point,

00:38:36.839 --> 00:38:43.527
because at this point the
output is VS and VGS has just

00:38:43.527 --> 00:38:49.596
begun to equal VT.
So think about where the second

00:38:49.596 --> 00:38:55.169
point is for valid operation.
It is here, and,

00:38:55.169 --> 00:39:02.647
somewhere along that load line.
Remember the load line is a

00:39:02.647 --> 00:39:06.960
constraint that must be met by
the output VO.

00:39:06.960 --> 00:39:11.764
It is the constraint imposed by
KVL on the output.

00:39:11.764 --> 00:39:17.352
So the output is constrained to
operate in this regime for

00:39:17.352 --> 00:39:22.254
various values of VGS.
So as the output keeps going

00:39:22.254 --> 00:39:27.156
from here all the way here,
at some point I exit my

00:39:27.156 --> 00:39:32.658
saturation region.
And that other point is given

00:39:32.658 --> 00:39:36.141
by this one.
So notice that this is the

00:39:36.141 --> 00:39:40.449
curve that bounds.
On the left-hand side of this

00:39:40.449 --> 00:39:43.841
the MOSFET is no longer in
saturation.

00:39:43.841 --> 00:39:49.066
It is on the right-hand side,
and so therefore this is the

00:39:49.066 --> 00:39:52.000
valid operating region.

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:04.406
Here to here.
This is good.

00:40:04.406 --> 00:40:09.830
This is VS.
That is good to know.

00:40:09.830 --> 00:40:17.796
And for this point I know that
VI, which is VGS,

00:40:17.796 --> 00:40:23.728
equals VT.
I know VO is equal to VS.

00:40:23.728 --> 00:40:30.000
And IDS, at this point,
is 0.

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:37.565
So VO and IDS being VS and 0
correspondingly are the output

00:40:37.565 --> 00:40:42.521
operating perimeters when VI
equals VD.

00:40:42.521 --> 00:40:48.913
So that is one point.
And let's find out what this

00:40:48.913 --> 00:40:53.869
point is.
At that point I get my output

00:40:53.869 --> 00:41:03.000
just entering the range of the
MOSFET triode region operation.

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:09.326
Notice that this point is the
intersection of two curves,

00:41:09.326 --> 00:41:15.539
this line and this curve.
So this curve here is given by

00:41:15.539 --> 00:41:19.606
IDS equals K divided by 2 VO
squared.

00:41:19.606 --> 00:41:23.334
And this is my load line
equation.

00:41:23.334 --> 00:41:30.000
So that is VS divided by RL
minus VO divided by RL.

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:32.599
That's it.
So I won't go ahead and solve

00:41:32.599 --> 00:41:35.533
that for you.
You can go and check it out and

00:41:35.533 --> 00:41:39.533
convince yourselves that if you
solve these two equations and

00:41:39.533 --> 00:41:43.133
find out the VO for this,
it should be the same VO that

00:41:43.133 --> 00:41:46.000
you obtained using the other
graph.

00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:01.031
What I have done here,
obtaining the valid regions of

00:42:01.031 --> 00:42:04.596
operation is no different from
what I did here.

00:42:04.596 --> 00:42:08.550
The two are alternative
approaches to getting to the

00:42:08.550 --> 00:42:11.806
same place.
Just that over the years what I

00:42:11.806 --> 00:42:16.534
have discovered is that there
are one class of people that are

00:42:16.534 --> 00:42:21.341
output transfer function people,
this graph, and another set of

00:42:21.341 --> 00:42:27.000
people that are load line people
that like to think that way.

00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:31.042
I have always been a transfer
function person myself,

00:42:31.042 --> 00:42:35.472
but some of you may be load
line people and so you can use

00:42:35.472 --> 00:42:39.359
that to drive your intuition.
It is pretty amazing.

00:42:39.359 --> 00:42:43.789
As we get into this business
and keep going down the path,

00:42:43.789 --> 00:42:48.531
it is amazing how some people
really kind of get the load line

00:42:48.531 --> 00:42:53.195
thing and others feel much more
comfortable with the transfer

00:42:53.195 --> 00:42:55.915
function.
So pick whatever you want.

00:42:55.915 --> 00:43:00.346
So what we have so far is we
have conducted a large signal

00:43:00.346 --> 00:43:06.193
analysis of a MOSFET amplifier.
It is an analysis of a circuit,

00:43:06.193 --> 00:43:09.872
and we found two things.
One is the transfer function

00:43:09.872 --> 00:43:13.764
under saturation operation,
and we found the valid input

00:43:13.764 --> 00:43:17.301
operating ranges and the
corresponding valid output

00:43:17.301 --> 00:43:19.566
operating ranges for the
circuit.

00:43:19.566 --> 00:43:23.811
In the last five or six minutes
let me talk about a couple of

00:43:23.811 --> 00:43:26.853
other issues.
And the first issue is what we

00:43:26.853 --> 00:43:31.028
have done so far is intuitively
and mathematically shown you

00:43:31.028 --> 00:43:36.543
what the valid regions are.
Now you are thinking that's

00:43:36.543 --> 00:43:41.159
fine, but how do I get there?
This region is good,

00:43:41.159 --> 00:43:44.927
VT through that other point,
that's good,

00:43:44.927 --> 00:43:49.543
but how do I get there?
How do I make my amplifier

00:43:49.543 --> 00:43:54.347
operate in that region?
The answer is pretty simple,

00:43:54.347 --> 00:44:00.000
and let me drive the intuition
again using a graph.

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:15.000
So this is a graph.
And I showed you that --

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:25.500
That was my valid region here.
Take a 45 degree line,

00:44:25.500 --> 00:44:28.865
find out where it intersects
the transfer function,

00:44:28.865 --> 00:44:32.230
then this is the valid region
here, VT through that

00:44:32.230 --> 00:44:36.000
coordinating function that we
developed out there.

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:45.132
If I have an input that looks
like so, some input whose

00:44:45.132 --> 00:44:54.772
gyrations fall within this
range, will constantly keep the

00:44:54.772 --> 00:45:01.590
MOSFET in saturation.
And the corresponding output

00:45:01.590 --> 00:45:06.122
will look like this.
If my input is in this range,

00:45:06.122 --> 00:45:09.360
my output will be within this
range.

00:45:09.360 --> 00:45:12.690
And how do I get my input to be
here?

00:45:12.690 --> 00:45:17.962
Let's say I have a sinusoid
that is 1 volt peak to peak or

00:45:17.962 --> 00:45:21.292
whatever.
How do I get my sinusoid up

00:45:21.292 --> 00:45:24.252
there?
Well, you have learned the

00:45:24.252 --> 00:45:28.322
trick on how to boost things.
Remember boost?

00:45:28.322 --> 00:45:33.409
All you have to do is boost up
your signal by some value

00:45:33.409 --> 00:45:39.980
capital VI.
And the way you do that is as

00:45:39.980 --> 00:45:42.588
follows.
VS, RL, VO.

00:45:42.588 --> 00:45:49.450
What you do is you apply a DC
offset to your input.

00:45:49.450 --> 00:45:56.725
You take your sinusoid and
boost it up so that all the

00:45:56.725 --> 00:46:04.000
gyrations of the input are in
the valid range.

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:06.789
This is my input,
some VA.

00:46:06.789 --> 00:46:13.150
Then I apply some DC offset
capital VI given by this value

00:46:13.150 --> 00:46:16.832
here.
And boost up the interesting

00:46:16.832 --> 00:46:20.961
input?
My interesting input is the VA.

00:46:20.961 --> 00:46:27.656
And I boost it up by capital VI
so that this guy is always in

00:46:27.656 --> 00:46:32.230
saturation.
I would like to show you a

00:46:32.230 --> 00:46:36.262
little demo now.
I am going to show you an input

00:46:36.262 --> 00:46:40.808
that is a triangular wave.
And what we will do is I'll

00:46:40.808 --> 00:46:44.497
play with a wide variety of
offset voltages.

00:46:44.497 --> 00:46:49.473
This guy is a triangular wave.
And what I am going to do is

00:46:49.473 --> 00:46:54.191
apply a triangular wave and
we'll look at the output and

00:46:54.191 --> 00:46:59.080
convince ourselves that I get
amplification when VI is big

00:46:59.080 --> 00:47:05.000
enough that the input goes into
a valid operating range.

00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:09.571
And we will look at a variety
of ranges here.

00:47:09.571 --> 00:47:13.000
You can put it a little larger.

00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:28.564
OK.
So the triangular wave is my

00:47:28.564 --> 00:47:31.590
input.
And this is my output.

00:47:31.590 --> 00:47:34.554
This looks nothing like a
triangular wave.

00:47:34.554 --> 00:47:38.385
And the reason is that I do not
have the right offset.

00:47:38.385 --> 00:47:42.433
So what I will do is gradually
increase the offset on the

00:47:42.433 --> 00:47:45.108
MOSFET.
So at this point the offset is

00:47:45.108 --> 00:47:47.927
very low, a very small near zero
offset.

00:47:47.927 --> 00:47:50.819
And so therefore my output is a
disaster.

00:47:50.819 --> 00:47:53.927
My MOSFET is not in saturation
all the time.

00:47:53.927 --> 00:47:57.614
So what I will do here is apply
some sort of offset.

00:47:57.614 --> 00:48:01.945
Is this the one?
We want to switch.

00:48:01.945 --> 00:48:06.918
This is the input.
You can see I am applying an

00:48:06.918 --> 00:48:12.000
offset by bumping and boosting
up the input.

00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:23.259
I don't have clipping happening
at both ends,

00:48:23.259 --> 00:48:26.518
but I get something.
And I get amplification.

00:48:26.518 --> 00:48:30.000
Now let me apply way too much
of an offset.

00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:33.188
With this offset I am kind of
operating here.

00:48:33.188 --> 00:48:37.608
What I will do now is apply an
even higher offset so that this

00:48:37.608 --> 00:48:40.144
triangular wave begins to move
here.

00:48:40.144 --> 00:48:44.420
If I apply a very high offset
what I am doing is overdriving

00:48:44.420 --> 00:48:47.463
the amplifier,
boosting it so high that the

00:48:47.463 --> 00:48:51.884
MOSFET is going to go into its
triode region and you are going

00:48:51.884 --> 00:48:54.275
to see that I won't have any
gain.

00:48:54.275 --> 00:48:58.405
My output is going to shrink
noticeably if I overdrive the

00:48:58.405 --> 00:49:03.630
input.
You will notice the input going

00:49:03.630 --> 00:49:09.018
higher and higher.
Pull the trigger point down.

00:49:09.018 --> 00:49:13.819
There you go.
Notice that as I boost up my

00:49:13.819 --> 00:49:20.495
input even higher notice that
the output is a really small

00:49:20.495 --> 00:49:26.000
image of what the right input
should be.

00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:30.142
The right answer here,
of course, is that I apply some

00:49:30.142 --> 00:49:34.675
right amount of offset to boost
up the input into the right

00:49:34.675 --> 00:49:38.818
regime so that the output is
seen to be some amplified

00:49:38.818 --> 00:49:42.804
version of this input.
So I showed you three things.

00:49:42.804 --> 00:49:46.165
One is very little offset.
That was like so,

00:49:46.165 --> 00:49:49.526
as the thing comes down.
A very high offset,

00:49:49.526 --> 00:49:53.590
it gets killed again.
And the right amount of offset.

00:49:53.590 --> 00:49:58.202
But notice that we still have a
problem, even with the right

00:49:58.202 --> 00:50:02.019
offset.
The output is not linearly

00:50:02.019 --> 00:50:04.893
related to the input.
It is nonlinear.

00:50:04.893 --> 00:50:09.242
And the answer to get a linear
response is good old small

00:50:09.242 --> 00:50:12.504
signal stuff.
And we will be looking at the

00:50:12.504 --> 00:50:14.970
small signal part in the next
lecture.
