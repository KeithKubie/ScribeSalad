00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:11.919
It is maddening to be reminded to appreciate
what we have:

00:00:11.919 --> 00:00:16.500
for someone to tell us we shouldn’t forget
to be grateful.

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:23.500
It’s in conflict with our times, and their
emphasis on constant ambition and striving.

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:30.730
The idea of pausing to take stock of what
has gone well, to be content with many things

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:36.809
as they are - this feels strange and dangerous,
like some kind of a loser’s counsel - or

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.320
the consolation prize.

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:43.699
But in truth, there is so much that, if we
learnt we might be dead by nightfall, we would

00:00:43.699 --> 00:00:46.140
promptly remember to value: 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.500
the summer night sky

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.900
the taste of cold milk

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:51.900
old brick walls

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:53.600
deserted railway stations

00:00:54.500 --> 00:01:00.000
the presence of our partners beside us in
the stillness of dawn.

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.400
We are ungrateful partly out of a fear; a
fear of accepting what we have – as if to

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:14.990
pause to appreciate things as they are might
make us ‘soft’, complacent, without the

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:18.340
will-power to take on new challenges.

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:21.240
Anxiety feels so much more natural.

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.460
It’s been with us from the start.

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:32.439
But ultimately, it's not heroic or sensible
always to be dissatisfied; relentlessly to

00:01:32.439 --> 00:01:39.060
focus on everything that's gone wrong and
to obsess about our humiliations and rejections.

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:46.060
There's in truth far more courage and skill
in being able to identify a hopeful perspective:

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:52.009
in knowing how to train and keep our eyes
on what’s been - more or less - OK.

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:59.900
What can best help us in this is - oddly - is the
thought of our own death: how soon and how

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:07.249
unexpectedly it may come, and how much we'll
miss about life when it does.

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:14.890
We are constantly undermined by our failure
to retain the purity and drama of this helpfully

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:18.800
morbid insight – which should strike us
once every day at least

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:24.590
and to put it to powerful use in the ordinary course of
life.

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:31.170
Gratitude is the dividend due to us when,
for a few moments, we begin to assess our

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:38.099
lives with a truer sense of all our small
but significant advantages - and with a frank,

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:43.029
humble recognition of all we have to lose
- and one day will.
