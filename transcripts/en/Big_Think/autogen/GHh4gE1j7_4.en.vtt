development in autism research well I

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910
development in autism research well I
 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:19.130
development in autism research well I
could try and is that because we're very

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140
could try and is that because we're very
 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.050
could try and is that because we're very
involved in that at the Simons

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060
involved in that at the Simons
 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.840

research relevant to autism and we are

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510
research relevant to autism and we are
 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.990
research relevant to autism and we are
now looking for partnerships because no

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000
now looking for partnerships because no
 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.020
now looking for partnerships because no
one can do this on their own no matter

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030
one can do this on their own no matter
 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.740
one can do this on their own no matter
how dedicated or how many resources they

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750
how dedicated or how many resources they
 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.780
how dedicated or how many resources they
have so they need to be partnerships

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790
have so they need to be partnerships
 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.139
have so they need to be partnerships
with industry and with the NIH I think

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149
with industry and with the NIH I think
 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.060
with industry and with the NIH I think
we also need more cooperation and

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070
we also need more cooperation and
 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.889
we also need more cooperation and
collaboration between the school system

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899
collaboration between the school system
 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.049
collaboration between the school system
and the universities that are doing

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059
and the universities that are doing
 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.479
and the universities that are doing
research in many areas it's very very

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489
research in many areas it's very very
 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.040
research in many areas it's very very
hard to get into the public school

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050
hard to get into the public school
 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.840
hard to get into the public school
system for example for universities to

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850
system for example for universities to
 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.420
system for example for universities to
do research there and I think that that

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430
do research there and I think that that
 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.160
do research there and I think that that
creates a major problem and the main

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170
creates a major problem and the main
 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.959
creates a major problem and the main
problem is that our research findings

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969
problem is that our research findings
 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.280
problem is that our research findings
aren't getting out into the community

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290
aren't getting out into the community
 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.390
aren't getting out into the community
they're not getting to the medical

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400
they're not getting to the medical

community they're not getting into the
just the general practice why is that

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020
just the general practice why is that
 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.359

Angeles there are major bureaucracies

and unions associated with how the

and unions associated with how the
 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.499
and unions associated with how the
schools work and they do not want

schools work and they do not want
 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.270

outside influence i think that there's a

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280
outside influence i think that there's a
 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.670
outside influence i think that there's a
perception that if we come up with a

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680
perception that if we come up with a
 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.320
perception that if we come up with a
treatment that is effective that they

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330
treatment that is effective that they
 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.560
treatment that is effective that they
will be mandated to to deliver that that

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570
will be mandated to to deliver that that
 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.060
will be mandated to to deliver that that
intervention and they don't have the

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070
intervention and they don't have the
 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.370
intervention and they don't have the
finances to do that I think that we have

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380
finances to do that I think that we have
 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.230
finances to do that I think that we have
a general problem in that we haven't

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240
a general problem in that we haven't
 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.810
a general problem in that we haven't
quite figured out if autism is something

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820
quite figured out if autism is something
 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.429
quite figured out if autism is something
that should be treated in the medical

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439
that should be treated in the medical
 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.880
that should be treated in the medical
world or in the educational world and

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:42.890
world or in the educational world and
 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:45.080
world or in the educational world and
each of course would like to put it in

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090
each of course would like to put it in
 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.370
each of course would like to put it in
the other place so that they won't have

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380
the other place so that they won't have
 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.230
the other place so that they won't have
to pay for it and there isn't really a

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240
to pay for it and there isn't really a
 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.609
to pay for it and there isn't really a
unified approach to dealing with that

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619
unified approach to dealing with that
 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.170
unified approach to dealing with that
one of course it needs to be dealt with

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180
one of course it needs to be dealt with
 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.630
one of course it needs to be dealt with
in both worlds and so there's a lot of

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640
in both worlds and so there's a lot of
 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.389
in both worlds and so there's a lot of
passing the buck and no clear way of

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399
passing the buck and no clear way of
 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:59.330
passing the buck and no clear way of
facilitating getting research and

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340
facilitating getting research and
 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.580
facilitating getting research and
getting new treatments into the places

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590
getting new treatments into the places
 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.160
getting new treatments into the places
where it needs to be that's fascinating

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170
where it needs to be that's fascinating
 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.010
where it needs to be that's fascinating
I think in the medical arena there's

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020
I think in the medical arena there's
 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.139
I think in the medical arena there's
also a lot of room for improvement 20 or

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149
also a lot of room for improvement 20 or
 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:10.460
also a lot of room for improvement 20 or
30 years ago came the rise of the

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470
30 years ago came the rise of the
 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.230
30 years ago came the rise of the
Comprehensive Cancer Center because

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:12.240
Comprehensive Cancer Center because
 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:15.410
Comprehensive Cancer Center because
there was the availability of new cancer

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420
there was the availability of new cancer
 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.180
there was the availability of new cancer
chemotherapeutic agents that had to be

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190
chemotherapeutic agents that had to be
 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.460
chemotherapeutic agents that had to be
tested and that showed promise as

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470
tested and that showed promise as
 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:20.510
tested and that showed promise as
recently as two or three years ago

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520
recently as two or three years ago
 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.640
recently as two or three years ago
nobody thought that we needed that for

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650
nobody thought that we needed that for
 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.590
nobody thought that we needed that for
autism because there was no reason to

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600
autism because there was no reason to
 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.630
autism because there was no reason to
think that any specific agents would be

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640
think that any specific agents would be
 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.970
think that any specific agents would be
useful and that's what's changing and as

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980
useful and that's what's changing and as
 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:34.340
useful and that's what's changing and as
dr. Fishbach mentioned we need to now

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350
dr. Fishbach mentioned we need to now
 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:36.680
dr. Fishbach mentioned we need to now
start using cancer as a model where we

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690
start using cancer as a model where we
 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:40.040
start using cancer as a model where we
get a much higher proportion of kids and

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050
get a much higher proportion of kids and
 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:42.650
get a much higher proportion of kids and
families with autism enrolled and

involved in the opportunity to try out
 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:48.170
involved in the opportunity to try out
new medical agents but that will require

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180
new medical agents but that will require
 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.650
new medical agents but that will require
a major partnership to realign how we

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660
a major partnership to realign how we
 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.600
a major partnership to realign how we
