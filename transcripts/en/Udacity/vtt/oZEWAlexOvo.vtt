I love Prezi. It's an awesome tool that let's me think high level, as well

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:07.550
as drill down into the details of each one of the steps we showed you.

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:10.290
&gt;&gt; And the next level of detail would be to go over to the actual UI

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.130
elements, within each of those flows. But unfortunately,

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:15.240
we're not going to cover that in this course.

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:16.880
&gt;&gt; Yeah, and that's where mobile constraints

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.470
come in, when we think about the implementation.

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.070
&gt;&gt; So let's talk about the mobile user constraints. You want to

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:25.528
think about handedness and decide whether or not your user experience is

00:00:25.528 --> 00:00:28.430
one-handed or two-handed, and keep that in mind even though

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:31.280
we're not going to go into the UI elements right now.

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:34.330
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Another thing you want to keep in mind is limited data and battery life

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:36.800
and sketchy network. So when you think about

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.490
the menu and the order history and all that

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:42.080
information that has to be downloaded for this

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:45.020
application to work, think about synching that intelligently so

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:46.670
you're not draining battery, and so that it

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:50.580
works in non-fly mode. So for divided attention and

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:53.580
small screen, you have to make sure that the user

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:56.590
interface is built in such a way that it doesn't overwhelm

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:00.101
the user with too much information because again, they're, Debbie

00:01:00.101 --> 00:01:03.470
is out and about doing things. Also make intelligent use of

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:07.070
notifications, and that's a great way to give Debbie information

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:09.630
when she needs it, relevant to your application. For example, in

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.880
the order status update and that way they don't have to

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.810
open your application and spend any more effort than they absolutely

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.490
need to to get what they need from your app.
