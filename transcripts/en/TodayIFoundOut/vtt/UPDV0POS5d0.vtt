00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.150
Why a Bakers Dozen is 13 Instead of 12

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:09.300
There are three main theories for why a baker’s
dozen is 13 instead of 12, but most think

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.860
it has its origins in the fact that many societies
throughout history have had extremely strict

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.420
laws concerning baker’s wares, due to the
fact that it is fairly easy for bakers to

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.590
cheat patrons and sell them less than what
they think they are getting.

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:26.869
These societies took this very seriously as
bread was a primary food source for many people.

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:30.980
For example, in ancient Egypt, should a baker
be found to cheat someone, they would have

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:34.370
their ear nailed to the door of their bakery.

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:38.980
In Babylon, if a baker was found to have sold
a “light loaf” to someone, the baker would

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:40.899
have his hand chopped off.

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:45.350
Another example was in Britain in the mid-13th
century with the establishment of the Assize

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:50.270
of Bread and Ale statute, which was in effect
all the way up to the 19th century before

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:54.629
being repealed by the Statute Law Revision
Act of 1863.

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:59.039
The Assize of Bread and Ale statute set the
price of ale and what weight a farthing loaf

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.409
of bread should be.

00:01:00.409 --> 00:01:04.210
Specifically it stated:
“By the consent of the whole realm of England,

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:08.710
the measure of the king was made; that is
to say: that an English penny, called a sterling

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:13.780
round, and without any clipping, shall weigh
thirty-two wheat corns in the midst of the

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:19.100
ear, and twenty-pence do make an ounce, and
twelve ounces one pound, and eight pounds

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:24.439
do make a gallon of wine, and eight gallons
of wine do make a London bushel, which is

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:26.369
the eighth part of a quarter.”

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.890
So basically, in terms of bread, setting the
relationship between the price of wheat and

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:35.270
what the subsequent price of a loaf of bread
from a certain quantity of wheat should be.

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:40.049
Even though this statute was enacted at the
request of bakers, it still posed a problem

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.049
for them.

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:45.259
If they happened to accidentally cheat a customer
by giving them less than what they were supposed

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:50.859
to as outlined by the statute, they were subject
to extremely severe fines and punishment,

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:55.520
which varied depending on where the lawbreaker
lived, but could include, like the Babylonians’

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.740
punishment, losing a hand.

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.950
As it wasn’t that hard to accidentally cheat
a customer, given making a loaf of bread with

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.920
exacting attributes is nearly impossible by
hand without modern day tools, bakers began

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:12.540
giving more than what the statute outlined
to make sure they went over and never under.

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.720
Specifically, in terms of the “baker’s
dozen”, if a vendor or other customer were

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.319
to order a dozen or several dozen loaves of
bread from a baker, the baker would give them

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:23.870
13 for every dozen they ordered.

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:29.250
Likewise, when selling quantities of anything,
they’d give 13 measures when only 12 were

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:30.250
purchased.

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:33.769
This practice eventually made its way into
the Worshipful Company of Bakers guild code

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:34.909
in London.

00:02:34.909 --> 00:02:39.360
This guild was actually started in the 12th
century and had a large part in formulating

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.030
the rules on the Assize of Bread and Ale statute.

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:47.420
All that said, although the above is generally
thought to be the correct origins for a baker’s

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:52.489
dozen, there are two alternate theories put
forth that are somewhat plausible, though

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:56.319
lacking in hard historical evidence and visible
progression.

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:01.150
The first is that bakers would sell 13 loaves
to vendors, while only charging them for 12

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:07.000
which allowed the vendor to then sell the
13 at full price earning a 7.7% profit per

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.000
loaf.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.180
So in this case, vendors were being given
a sort of wholesale price, but without breaking

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:17.120
the laws outlined in the Assize of Bread and
Ale which had no exceptions for allowing a

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:18.830
cheaper price to vendors.

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:23.200
This theory has some holes in it, but is somewhat
plausible on the whole.

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:27.849
Yet another theory is that it was simply a
product of the way bakers bake bread.

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:31.230
Baking trays tend to have a 3:2 aspect ratio.

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:35.980
The most efficient two-dimensional arrangement
then of loaves/biscuits/etc. on such a tray

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:43.219
results in 13 items with a 4+5+4 hexagonal
arrangement, which avoids corners.

00:03:43.219 --> 00:03:46.860
It was important to avoid the corners because
the corners of a baking tray will heat up

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:51.370
and cool off faster than the edges and the
interior, which would result in not cooking

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:54.220
anything on the corner evenly with the rest.

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:58.540
This theory doesn’t explain why they’d
sell them in batches 13 for the price of 12,

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:03.680
but at least explains why they may have commonly
made them in batches of 13 in the first place

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:08.670
and is still a possible source, or at least
contributor, to the “baker’s dozen”

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:13.459
if it was fairly universal that baker’s
baked things in groups of 13, as is suggested

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:14.459
by the theory.

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:18.670
But, in the end, most historians think that
the first theory- that bakers simply were

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:23.100
trying to make sure they didn’t accidentally
break any laws- is the correct one.

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:26.190
Bonus Facts:
• The term “baker” dates back to around

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:27.670
the year 1000.

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:30.530
Another term that meant the same thing from
that time was “bakester”.

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:35.130
This latter word is thought to have referred
to female bakers; this is similar to how a

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:39.250
“webster” was a female weaver, with the
“-ster” ending implying a woman.

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:43.830
From this, if your last name is “Baxter”,
you probably had a professional female baker

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:45.700
somewhere up your family tree.

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:50.640
“Bakester” is where the surname “Baxter”
comes from.

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:54.450
• One might think checking to see if a baker
was cheating you on a loaf would be as simple

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:58.170
as weighing the loaf, but this was not actually
the case.

00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:01.670
Bakers had many tricks up their sleeves for
cheating customers while having the weight

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:03.670
come out more or less correctly.

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:08.230
One such trick was to add a bit of ground
sand to the loaf to get the weight just so,

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:22.860
while being able to use less wheat.
