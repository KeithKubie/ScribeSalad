00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:01.260
- [Instructor] In this video,

00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:02.870
we're gonna talk about enzymes.

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:05.830
And in particular, we're
going to talk about the effect

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:10.830
of pH on enzymes, how acidic
or basic the environment is,

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:13.890
how that affects enzyme activity.

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:16.370
So just as a bit of a review,

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:20.800
enzymes are molecules that help
catalyze various reactions,

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.280
and they are all throughout
biological systems.

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:28.350
Most enzymes are proteins,
large proteins oftentimes,

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:30.650
made up of chains of amino acids.

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:33.130
And so I could draw a chain of amino acid,

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:35.680
where each of these circles
represents an amino acid.

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:38.220
And the primary structure
is just a sequence

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:41.520
of the amino acids, but there
is also a secondary structure

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.250
on how this amino acid
backbone interacts with itself.

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:49.450
And a lot of that is
based on hydrogen bonding.

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:51.630
So that amino acid and that amino acid,

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:54.880
maybe it forms some type of hydrogen bond.

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:57.740
And just as a review, a
hydrogen bond is an interaction

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:02.430
between hydrogen and a
more electronegative atom.

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.080
So for example, we've seen this in water.

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:09.860
Let me draw a couple of water
molecules right over here.

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:11.530
And this is all review.

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:13.320
In water, you have these covalent bonds

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.310
between the oxygen and the hydrogen.

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:17.520
So arguably, they're
sharing the electrons.

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.770
But because oxygen is
more electronegative,

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.810
it likes to hog the electrons more,

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.170
the electrons spend more
time around the oxygens.

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:26.860
So the oxygen end of a water molecule

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:28.830
gets a partially negative charge,

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:31.230
and then the hydrogen
ends of a water molecule

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:33.640
get a partially positive,

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:35.780
partially positive charge.

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.890
This is the Greek lowercase
delta for partially,

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:42.480
partial charge is what
it's typically used for.

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:45.130
And so the partially negative
ends would be attracted

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:47.550
to the partially positive
ends of another molecule,

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:49.360
and that's what hydrogen bonds are.

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:51.090
It's not always between
hydrogen and oxygen.

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.640
In fact, oftentimes it's
between hydrogen and nitrogen,

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.480
which is another electronegative atom.

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:59.110
And these hydrogen bonds,
not only do they help define

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:01.120
the secondary structure of the proteins,

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:03.190
which helps to find the
shape of the protein,

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:06.040
they can also interact with
the substrate of the protein,

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:07.550
the things that the protein's

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:10.180
trying to catalyze reactions on.

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:11.960
So for example, if that's the substrate,

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:13.850
and I'm just doing it as a big red circle,

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:16.060
parts of it might form hydrogen bonds

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.080
with the enzyme itself.

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.900
And if you want to see a
more complex picture of that,

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.290
this is a detailed schematic

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:27.450
of a substrate interacting with an enzyme,

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.540
where what you see in, circled in yellow,

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:31.970
that is the substrate here.

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:33.890
And you see these dotted lines,

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:35.460
those are the hydrogen bonds.

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:37.190
So you could see a hydrogen bond

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:38.840
between a hydrogen and a nitrogen,

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:41.830
a hydrogen bond between
an oxygen and a hydrogen.

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:44.050
And so the yellow part is a substrate.

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:46.060
And all the stuff that's
wrapping around it,

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:48.620
that is the enzyme itself.

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:52.170
So with that out of the way,
how does pH play into it?

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:55.370
Well, we just have to
remind ourselves what pH is.

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:58.450
pH, which is often viewed
as the power of hydrogen,

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:00.280
that's where the p comes from,

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.120
is the negative log, or at
least the way it's introduced

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.780
in many introductory chemistry class,

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.250
the negative log of the hydrogen

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.000
ion concentration.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.930
And a hydrogen ion is
essentially a proton.

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:16.630
Well, how would this
affect an enzyme's shape

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:19.620
and its ability to interact
with the substrate,

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.600
the thing that it's trying to act on?

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:23.890
Well, if you have a bunch of,

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:25.930
depending on how many hydrogen ions

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:27.870
you have floating around,
and oftentimes it'll be

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:30.870
in the form of hydronium,
which is a water molecule

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:34.930
where the oxygen is bonded
to one extra hydrogen proton,

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:37.480
well, it might mess with
these hydrogen bonds,

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:41.610
where some of these hydrogen
protons usurp the bond

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:45.030
with the negative end of
one of these molecules

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:47.850
or repel some of the positive ends

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:50.020
of some of these molecules
in a certain way.

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:52.800
And so you could imagine
that different enzymes

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:54.810
might have a different level of activity

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:57.590
at different levels of pH,

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:00.090
and that actually is the case.

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:04.150
In fact, you'll often see a
diagram that looks like this.

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:08.380
So in the vertical axis,
you will often see reaction,

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:09.720
reaction

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:11.963
velocity,

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:15.630
where reaction velocity goes higher

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:18.120
as we go higher in the vertical direction.

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:21.450
And in this axis right over here,

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:25.980
you might see our level of pH.

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:29.670
And remember, pH, because you
have this negative out front,

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:34.370
a high hydrogen ion concentration,

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:35.930
because of this negative,

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:39.220
that will give you a low pH,

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:42.380
and that is associated with acidic,

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:43.720
acidic environments.

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:47.140
And a low hydrogen ion concentration,

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:49.670
that's associated with a high pH,

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:51.800
once again because of
this negative out front,

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:55.890
and that's associated with
a more basic situation.

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:58.330
And if your pH is around seven,

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:00.290
then that would be a neutral situation.

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:04.250
But different enzymes'
activities peak at different pHs.

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:07.200
So for example, you might
have an enzyme like this

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:10.580
whose activity peaks at a pH of,

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:13.610
let's say this is right
over here, a pH of four,

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:15.400
which is relatively acidic.

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:17.960
And you would typically
see this type of an enzyme

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:19.770
in, say, a place like the stomach,

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:21.800
which is a very acidic environment.

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:23.970
And then you might see other enzymes

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:27.320
that actually don't do too
well in an acidic environment,

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:31.400
but do quite well in a
more neutral environment.

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:36.400
So for example, this peak might
be at, say, a pH of seven.

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:38.060
And then you might have other enzymes

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:40.000
that do better in a basic environment.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.010
And we actually do see
this in the human body.

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:44.130
For example, lipase,

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:47.120
which is an enzyme that breaks down fat,

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:48.530
when it's found in the stomach,

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:50.770
that particular version of lipase,

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:53.350
it actually has optimum
activity closer to this,

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:56.380
at a pH of roughly four or five.

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:59.460
While lipase that is
secreted from the pancreas,

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:01.860
which acts in the small intestines,

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:05.190
which is a more neutral
environment or even slightly basic,

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:09.000
its optimal activity is at a pH of eight.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.670
So I will leave you there.

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:14.410
Big picture is, is that a
lot of an enzyme's shape

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:16.970
or its ability to
interact with a substrate

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:19.650
is based on hydrogen bonds.

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:23.100
And so you can imagine hydrogen
bonds could be influenced

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:25.560
by hydrogen ion concentration.

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:28.640
And so because of that,
depending on your enzyme

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:30.980
and sometimes the substrate
that you're dealing with,

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:33.490
you might have different
reaction velocities

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:35.060
at different pHs,

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:37.840
with some enzymes doing
better in acidic environments

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:39.620
and other enzymes doing better

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:42.173
in neutral or basic environments.
