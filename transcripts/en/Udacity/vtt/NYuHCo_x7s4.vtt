Ken, we need to film,
what are you doing?

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:04.130
&gt;&gt; Hold on, hold on, hold on.

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.640
&gt;&gt; You buying some tight kicks?

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:11.230
&gt;&gt; Yeah, and I'm just about done.

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:16.530
I can see that I just need to finish
my payment information and done.

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:20.450
&gt;&gt; Why don't you show
then what you just did?

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:23.060
&gt;&gt; Okay, all right, my phone wasn't
actually on because we're acting.

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:24.470
Come on we're filming.

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:25.960
Anyways.
[LAUGH] I just thought

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.080
this would be a good lead-in to
the feedback part of this lesson,

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:32.960
because it's all about showing
your users their progress.

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.540
&gt;&gt; I see,
you were buying something online and

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:39.000
the form was nice enough to show you
that you only had to finish paying.

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:41.960
&gt;&gt; Yeah, but my phone is off, so

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.680
why don't you show students
what this actually looks like?

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:45.180
&gt;&gt; Sounds good.
