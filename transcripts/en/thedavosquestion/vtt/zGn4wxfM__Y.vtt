&gt;&gt; Role models are important in every organization,
not just in countries such as the Middle East.

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:50.140
We need role models and the reason why we
need to have a person of, an individual that

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:51.440
can provide a vision, leadership, incites.
A person who can listen and a person who can

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:52.440
take the countries and people forward. The
lack of role models there will be a lack of

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.440
leadership. And with a lack of leadership
you will not know where you are going. And

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:54.440
you need to keep goals not only to turn them
into actions but also you need to have people

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:55.440
inspired. And people are not inspired unless,
there is someone who takes action to move

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:55.441
forward.
