00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:04.100
So let's say that this
circle-looking thing represents

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:04.800
a whole.

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:06.550
We've already seen a
couple of situations.

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:08.216
We said, hey, look,
we could divide this

00:00:08.216 --> 00:00:11.150
into two equal pieces.

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:14.470
And if we shade in
one of them-- so one

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:18.090
of these equal pieces--
that would be 1/2.

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.107
And then if we shade in two
of them, this would be 2/2.

00:00:21.107 --> 00:00:22.940
So let me color that
in a little bit better.

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:26.640
So this right over here, I've
divided into two equal pieces.

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.800
And I'm shading in two
of these equal pieces.

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:33.680
So what fraction of the
whole do I have shaded in?

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:35.550
Well, we've seen
this multiple times.

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:41.490
This is 2/2 of
the entire figure.

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:43.540
And we see we've shaded
in the entire figure.

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:49.025
So this is equal to 1 whole.

00:00:49.025 --> 00:00:49.900
And we could do that.

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:52.360
We don't have to just split
it into two equal parts.

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:56.930
We could split it into
three equal parts.

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:00.410
So let's say we were to split
it into three equal parts--

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:04.550
let me do that, my best attempt
to draw three equal parts.

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:08.710
Three equal parts looks
like a Mercedes symbol.

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:09.510
And that's my best.

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.730
I could draw a little
bit better job of that.

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:16.530
Let me be clear that I'm
trying to make them equal.

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.620
So that's three equal parts.

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:21.820
And then if we were to
actually shade in the three

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:26.600
equal parts-- so that
would be one of the three,

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:33.870
so that's 1/3, 2/3, and 3/3.

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:43.160
So once again, 3/3
is equal to 1 whole.

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:45.900
Now, what if we were to do
something, on some level,

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:47.230
even simpler?

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:49.850
What if we just take our
whole and we divide it

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:51.652
into only one equal section?

00:01:51.652 --> 00:01:52.860
Well, I've already done that.

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.660
This is one equal
section right over here.

00:01:55.660 --> 00:02:00.750
And then I were to select
that one equal section-- so

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.550
let me color it in.

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:06.390
So I have one section, and
I'm going to shade it in.

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:13.140
So what fraction of the whole
do I now have shaded in?

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.480
Well, I had one equal
section to begin with.

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:21.530
And I shaded in that
one equal section.

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:25.180
So I have 1/1 of this shaded in.

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:29.100
And this is also
clearly an entire whole.

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:33.020
So this is also
equal to a whole.

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:34.770
And I think you
see a pattern here.

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:40.210
2/2, 3/3, or 1/1-- these all
represent the exact same value.

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:42.280
They all represent a whole.

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.930
And you would also see this if
you were to draw a number line.

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:49.280
So this is 0.

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:50.290
This is 1.

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:52.020
We could keep on going.

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:54.230
Well, this is 1/1.

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:56.550
If I were to say, well,
between 0 and 1, I just have 1,

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:58.390
I divide it into one
equal chunk, well,

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:00.490
that's just this whole
thing right over here.

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:03.020
And if I were to move one
of those equal chunks,

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:08.290
I would get to 1.

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:15.600
If I divide it into two equal
chunks and if I make two

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:19.950
jumps-- one, two jumps--
I still end up at 1.

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:23.010
If I divide it into three
equal sections-- so let's

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:27.850
say one, two, three
equal sections-- and I

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:33.530
make three jumps-- one, two,
three-- I end up at 1 again.

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:38.090
So 2/2, 3/3, 1/1,
or 1 over 1-- these

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:42.920
all are different ways of
representing the number 1,

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:44.732
or 1 whole.
