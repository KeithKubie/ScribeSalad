00:00:06.384 --> 00:00:09.833
(paddle drum beat)

00:00:09.833 --> 00:00:11.210
(paddle drum beat)
- This kind of exhibition

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:12.577
is really unique,

00:00:12.577 --> 00:00:15.024
the public will see something
they never saw before,

00:00:15.024 --> 00:00:16.200
and I hope they will like it

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.213
and I hope they will
really have the different

00:00:18.213 --> 00:00:20.690
and change opinion about performance art.

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:23.160
So the preparation for the
MoMA show, it's going well.

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.466
I mean, it's a very big task for me

00:00:25.466 --> 00:00:26.851
because it's not just third perspective

00:00:26.851 --> 00:00:27.929
of my performers' work,

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:31.978
it's what really stands for
some kind of historical view,

00:00:31.978 --> 00:00:33.346
what performers can be,

00:00:33.346 --> 00:00:35.182
and how the performers
can enter the museum,

00:00:35.182 --> 00:00:37.875
and how can be performers
collected from the museum,

00:00:37.875 --> 00:00:41.028
and what happen if a performer die,

00:00:41.028 --> 00:00:43.529
if the work can be
re-performed, can be continue,

00:00:43.529 --> 00:00:45.740
and what kind of roles that will take.

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:46.428
It's really interesting

00:00:46.428 --> 00:00:48.764
to see how the performers can be present

00:00:48.764 --> 00:00:49.913
in the museum, live.

00:00:49.913 --> 00:00:53.384
The title of the show is Marina
AbramoviÄ‡ Artist is Present.

00:00:53.384 --> 00:00:56.132
Literally, I will be there
for entire period of time

00:00:56.132 --> 00:00:59.532
of three months and the
duration of the opening

00:00:59.532 --> 00:01:02.168
of the museum, which means
seven and a half hours

00:01:02.168 --> 00:01:03.544
of every day.

00:01:03.544 --> 00:01:05.552
Also, there will be re-performance

00:01:05.552 --> 00:01:09.030
of five of my performances,
some of which I made

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.833
in seventies and eighties,
and they're going

00:01:11.833 --> 00:01:15.717
to re-perform the same amount
of time, like three months.

00:01:15.717 --> 00:01:18.200
So this kind of thing's
never been done til now,

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.530
so it's a really big experiment.

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:24.016
I myself never actually
performed three months also.

00:01:24.016 --> 00:01:27.821
If at my opening, and my
opening come only the artists

00:01:27.821 --> 00:01:30.896
of my generation, I know of
something's terribly wrong,

00:01:30.896 --> 00:01:33.812
because it means that my work
doesn't communicate anywhere,

00:01:33.812 --> 00:01:35.513
that means it's dead.

00:01:35.513 --> 00:01:38.678
There was a very funny
interview of Leonard Cohen,

00:01:38.678 --> 00:01:41.517
and he say, "I am now in a third act,"

00:01:41.517 --> 00:01:44.179
and in third act,
everything start very well,

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:46.382
but in the end, the main actor die.

00:01:46.382 --> 00:01:49.683
I also feel that I'm in a
kind of third act right now,

00:01:49.683 --> 00:01:53.315
you know, (mumbing) MoMA,
it's finishing a huge amount

00:01:53.315 --> 00:01:57.147
of work, which is very
interesting about legacy,

00:01:57.147 --> 00:02:00.216
what you going to leave after you die.

00:02:00.216 --> 00:02:03.161
But one thing you can leave
always is a good idea,

00:02:03.161 --> 00:02:07.724
and I really wanted to have
this good idea to live after me.
