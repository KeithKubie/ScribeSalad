00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:05.720
hi I'm Jim al-khalili and here's my
question for you professor gross do you

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:05.730
question for you professor gross do you
 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.669
question for you professor gross do you
think that we are any closer to really

00:00:09.669 --> 00:00:09.679
think that we are any closer to really
 

00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:12.530

reconciling the forces of nature deep

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540
reconciling the forces of nature deep
 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.660

what is what is your view on string

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670
what is what is your view on string
 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.760
what is what is your view on string
theory and whether one day we will have

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770
theory and whether one day we will have
 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.109
theory and whether one day we will have
a theory of everything hi Jen so your

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119
a theory of everything hi Jen so your
 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.390
a theory of everything hi Jen so your
question is will we ever have a theory

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400
question is will we ever have a theory
 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.550
question is will we ever have a theory
of everything

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560
of everything
 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.400
of everything
I don't know I'm agnostic on the subject

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:30.410
I don't know I'm agnostic on the subject
 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:33.440
I don't know I'm agnostic on the subject
usually the way that question is asks

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450
usually the way that question is asks
 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.590
usually the way that question is asks
presumes that we know what everything is

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600
presumes that we know what everything is
 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.200
presumes that we know what everything is
what are all the questions we would like

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210
what are all the questions we would like
 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.310
what are all the questions we would like
to answer and the history of science

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320
to answer and the history of science
 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.970

tends to teach us that once we think

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980
tends to teach us that once we think
 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.110
tends to teach us that once we think
once we have achieved the answer to all

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120
once we have achieved the answer to all
 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.069
once we have achieved the answer to all
the questions we can ask in a given area

00:00:54.069 --> 00:00:54.079
the questions we can ask in a given area
 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:57.170
the questions we can ask in a given area
such as the fundamental laws of physics

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180
such as the fundamental laws of physics
 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.170
such as the fundamental laws of physics
for example new questions arise that we

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180
for example new questions arise that we
 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.720
for example new questions arise that we
didn't know how to ask before we didn't

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730
didn't know how to ask before we didn't
 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.929
didn't know how to ask before we didn't
know enough to ask those questions and

00:01:04.929 --> 00:01:04.939
know enough to ask those questions and
 

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:08.920
know enough to ask those questions and
although we have achieved the theory of

although we have achieved the theory of
 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:13.490
although we have achieved the theory of
everything we knew how to ask about way

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500
everything we knew how to ask about way
 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.160
everything we knew how to ask about way
back then now we have new questions

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170
back then now we have new questions
 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.130
back then now we have new questions
which whose answers we don't know so I

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:21.140
which whose answers we don't know so I
 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.170
which whose answers we don't know so I
think at the present the questions we

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180
think at the present the questions we
 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.190
think at the present the questions we
ask are are quite profound and deep and

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200
ask are are quite profound and deep and
 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.200
ask are are quite profound and deep and
they seem to include all possible

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210
they seem to include all possible
 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.200
they seem to include all possible
questions we could ask about elementary

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210
questions we could ask about elementary
 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.810
questions we could ask about elementary
particles and forces and fundamental

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820
particles and forces and fundamental

very well in answering all the questions

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790
very well in answering all the questions
 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.260
very well in answering all the questions
we can post today most likely we will

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270
we can post today most likely we will
 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:55.910

not have achieved a theory of everything

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920
not have achieved a theory of everything
 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.399
not have achieved a theory of everything
we will have simply achieved a theory of

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409
we will have simply achieved a theory of
 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.120
we will have simply achieved a theory of
all the questions we know how to ask and

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.130
all the questions we know how to ask and
 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:04.969
all the questions we know how to ask and
at that time we will realize that there

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979
at that time we will realize that there
 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:08.540
at that time we will realize that there
are new questions at the moment we don't

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550
are new questions at the moment we don't
 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:09.710
are new questions at the moment we don't
know enough to add

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720
know enough to add

know enough to add
that will still be open conceivably at

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:13.990
that will still be open conceivably at
 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:16.710
that will still be open conceivably at
some point we'll start running out of no

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720
some point we'll start running out of no
 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.580
some point we'll start running out of no
questions to ask and in that case there

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590
questions to ask and in that case there
 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:23.190
questions to ask and in that case there
might very well be a final theory of

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200
might very well be a final theory of
 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.120
might very well be a final theory of
everything but at the moment there's not

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.130
everything but at the moment there's not
 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:29.400
everything but at the moment there's not
much evidence that were close to that

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410
much evidence that were close to that
 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:31.709
much evidence that were close to that
point
