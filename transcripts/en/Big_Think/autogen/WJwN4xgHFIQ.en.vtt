it was not only a concept that deals
with a low-carbon economy it deals with

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:21.770
with a low-carbon economy it deals with
 

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:25.759
with a low-carbon economy it deals with
finding the solutions that will make it

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769
finding the solutions that will make it
 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.849
finding the solutions that will make it
possible for the world at large

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:27.859

able to live decent lives to have a
 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.369
able to live decent lives to have a
future for their children and that we

that can help us into a sustainable
development pattern and to invest in

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280
development pattern and to invest in
 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.270
development pattern and to invest in
even more new solutions to help that

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280
even more new solutions to help that
 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.430
