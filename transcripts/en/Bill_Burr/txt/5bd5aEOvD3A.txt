Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Hey, what's going on? It's bill burn. It's time for the Thursday afternoon. Just before Friday, Monday morning podcast. And I'm just checking in on Ya. That's right. I'm not yelling at, I'm fucking up my voice doing that. Every God damn week I'm starting to drink, throw Coty. I need to take care of myself in these next, this next chapter as they peel off another layer of the onion or whatever stupid artistry thing. I've just decided, you know, few people in my life, you know, I'm kind of seeing it. I'm seeing it. I'm seeing what live in a certain lifestyle leads to. And I'm like, you know what? I need to clean up my act a little bit. All right. It's time to grow. And so one of the first things I'm going to do, I'm not cutting out the booze or I'm just going to stop yelling. I'm checking in on you. You know, it's baby steps, you know, and I'll gradually work towards laying off the heroin. You know, I like it. It helps me, helps me go to sleep. You know the amount of times that I always want to take a nap when I'm standing up outside in public and I just can't do it because my mind just won't shut off. You know, that's, that's when the heroin comes in.

Speaker 1:          00:01:11       That's when it comes into play. You're going to have to listen to my phone, Ding Dong and cause I got a phone call coming up and I don't want to miss it here. Um, anyways, let me see here. Uh, uh, Jesus. Now I'm going to be looking at text messages, message messages, messages, while I'm trying to do this podcast. This is really going to fuck with my add here. How's your week going? I'm going to tell you something, right? Oh, but oh, Billy Booz bag. All right. I had, I had family and flew back. Sched some of you guys guessed the movie by the way. Um, it's something you do with a car.

Speaker 1:          00:01:46       Can't figure it out now I can't help you. Uh, what I love is now everybody knows what the movie is, but there's still going to tech treat me like, you know, the long, long, long trailer starring Lucille Ball. Um, why don't you guys ask me if it's every other movie that you can do with the car other than the one you notice. How about that? How about switching it up a little bit? Is it Herbie goes to Monte-Carlo you don't even realize all these years I've been using that as a reference. Like, cause it's the f one of the first or second movie I saw, I saw for the love of Benji. Then I saw Herbie goes to Monte-Carlo and my mother was just like, my mother told me, you know, they're just, those kids movies were stupid. I wasn't going to take it any more of those, you know, basically there wasn't anything there for her.

Speaker 1:          00:02:32       And she just was looking at like, you know, there's really nothing here for these kids. It's a fucking talking car. It's a talking dog. You know. How long are we going to keep the lie going? Alright, the fat fuck doesn't come down. The chimney. Dogs don't talk. And the fee w beetle, it's a, it's a, it's an economical car. But you know, at the end of the day it's not respect itself. That's it. Let's go see stripes. Um, anyways, uh, completely forgot what the fuck I was gonna say there out of fuck. Did I get to that? I have no idea. Do I need to go on Brian? I need to play some brain games. Several years. What the fuck was out? Eat more healthy. I don't know what it is. Oh yes. Oh Wow. Agamemnon. The family back east. I got it. I got it. We're back. Right. He'll be those outtakes on Casey Casey when he flips out screaming, yell.

Speaker 1:          00:03:24       Now God damn it. I'm not fucking reading about a fucking dog died. You know, this is basically like those outtakes, except I don't edit them up and I also don't have his iconic success. Yeah. Other than that, I think it seeks act. Same thing. But anyways, I had family come and fee and we'd kill me in palm bakeys twice in this past month. And, um, I had to take them out to the spots. We had to drink a little toast for the little one, a little Nini. Dude, she's laughing her ass off now. It's the greatest thing. It's the greatest thing ever. Um, could not be in a joint more in a first. And for the first time in my life I'm, someone can actually look at me and say happy father's Day. Right. And I don't have to be like, oh my God. In what Comedy Club did you work?

Speaker 1:          00:04:19       How old is it? Um, anyways, now I was never like that on the road. I was a good boy, sort of. I had my moments anyways, plowing ahead here. Um, so because they came in, I kind of got off my diet. I was still doing the cardio every day, so I stepped on the scale and the unacceptable second number in my world is eight. Okay. If it's ever a nine, I'm telling you right now, I am going to jump off a fucking building. Um, I won't do that. I'll just buy really comfortable. I'll keep wearing the golf clothes that I wear that just get bigger. You know, I was getting to the John Daily Line. Um, so, uh, I'm, I'm back on it. I'm back on it. Jumped on the scale today. One 78.8. Still unacceptable. I haven't been having the worst fucking time trying to get down to my fighting weight.

Speaker 1:          00:05:08       I wanted to be one 72 by my birthday, my 49th, the end of the forties. Wrapping it up. If I was a professional athlete, I would be 10 years for tired unless I was Tom Brady with my senior we muscles or whatever the fuck he's doing with his spongy muscles. Um, I don't know what he's doing. Sorry, I'm drinking the throat coat. Oh, Jesus. Bill, you're just annoying on so many different levels today. I apologize. Um, so anyways, I'm just, I'm going to try to just lay off the booze for a little bit. Um, I'm going to San Francisco, uh, this weekend and, uh, I'm working with fucking my dean off my Dean Martin. Joe De Rosa. Okay. So that's going to be, that's going to be a Mulligan that night.

Speaker 1:          00:06:05       Joe. My friendship with Joe to Rosa in his friendship with me is one of the great friendships in show business history and it's all, it's all alcohol fueled. You know, I don't think we've ever hung around each other sober and I don't think that I got to get him on the podcast. I really got to get all fucking Joe to rose or whatever. His background is, Egyptian, Italian. He doesn't know that man was left at a doorstep of a funny bone way back in 1977. I believe he showed up on a knower, a baby nobody wanted, he came out of the womb already wearing those dark frame glasses.

Speaker 1:          00:06:46       Um, it's sad, but said I'm anyways plowing ahead. Okay. I'm sure I'm going to hear about that from old Joey. Um, I'm guessing two drinks in, they do. There was something I want to talk to you about. It's, I know you were just joking, but you know, to bring that up, it's just really, um, fuck him. He trashed my dog on stage. Oh, that's coming out fourth drinking. I'm trying to guess where the argument's gonna come from this weekend. Why drink with Joe? We really don't argue anymore. Once I discovered, fair enough, you know, I grew up a little bit, he grew up a little bit and that's all we do. We start to argue and then one of us just goes, hey, fee, fair enough. And we laugh and it just diffuses everything. Fair enough. Fair enough. Can Stop Wars. You know what I mean? This is our borderline now we think it said, hey, fair enough. Fair enough. I understand why you would take that, but I mean, you know, fair enough. Well are going to give it to us law. Yeah, I didn't say that. Well then I'm going to fucking start shooting. I think. Fair enough. Yeah. That's what you feel you need to do.

Speaker 2:          00:07:56       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:07:56       It just diffuses the other guy and then the other guy stayed in there going like, no, you're supposed to, you supposed to get mad. Then you get mad and then I get mad and then I lie to my people and you lie to your people. We dehumanize each other. Now, don't we start shooting?

Speaker 2:          00:08:10       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:08:11       fair enough. All right, fair enough. Um, anyways. Did Anybody Watch the, uh, the penguin's wrist of fucking predators? I'll tell you something about these teeth. These penguins from Pittsburgh is they know how to fucking win a goddamn series. Jesus Christ, the predators in an oh two hole for those of you bad at math when it's best, four out of seven, you're down oh two. That means you have to win four of the next five. Oh, the coach isn't going to tell you that. What's he going to say? All right guys. All right boys. We've got to take it one game at a time. Okay. Hey, these crossed the hall in that Locker Room Bay. They put their escape to on one one, one boot at a time. Okay, we've got to start winning the batch.

Speaker 2:          00:09:05       [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:09:06       take it one period of time. Do they are beating the shit out of Sidney Crosby, this playoff series. This plaintiff is just this, this, this playoff run. I don't know what he did to the refs, but they had done protecting that guy this slash and I'm there hooking them. They're fucking hitting him in the head. Anything that they could do. Um, I dunno. I think that they, uh, they, they should have brought a goon up or something.

Speaker 1:          00:09:38       Somebody to do something. I don't know. But anyways, how about fucking Malkin's goal? Absolute fucking s you know, and I know that they, uh, pulled out peto today or whatever his fucking name is for some reason I can't remember his Goddamn name. Pekka Rina. Dale's his name. Uh, Jesus, I can't cock sock. I can't remember some about it. Dick is the, is the Predator. I fucking watched every game and I still can't remember his name. The focus is new. Is it Pecorino? Was that the guy from San Jose? Was He on San Jose? And then he went to Nashville. You don't, once I stopped collecting cards, you know, and I turned to scotch. I just never been able to, I've never been able to handle the names anymore. But anyways, I don't give a fuck who you are, Ken Dryden. Patrick wa Terry Sawchuck. Nobody stops that fucking puck. That was an absolute filthy, filthy fucking goal.

Speaker 1:          00:10:39       Um, so my prediction way back in the day, what did I say? What did I say before I flip flopped and said Otto was gonna was gonna win game seven before I did that, I said the penguins were going to win the whole thing. So when it happens, I'm going to ignore the fact that I thought Ottawa was going to come back and win game seven cause I was questioning the goaltending in Pittsburgh. I'm going to ignore all of that and I'm going to pull up Paul version and say, dude, what did I say dude? I called it, um, just out of a, you know, jealousy. I want to, uh, I want to see the predators tie up the series. Not Jealousy, just out of like selfishness. I want to see the, um, the NHL season goes as many games as possible. But uh, though I tell you right now the way the tournaments and playing a, I mean I don't even see this called back to Pittsburgh. Uh, we'll see something incredible has to, how about the WHO? I don't know who the fuck shot the goal. That baby face kid there. I mean I've, that was like the puck had I said like there was one little fucking just puck sized space for a split second.

Speaker 2:          00:11:48       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:11:49       Between old, uh, a penis there, whatever his name is. It just opened up for half a second. The puck literally turned sideways like some Matrix Shit and went in the guy, I remember when I, when I saw it labs, I kind of fuck did that go in?

Speaker 2:          00:12:04       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:12:04       I Dunno man. I'll tell you the hockey gods are smiling down in Pittsburgh right now. Um, who knows. We'll see what sort of home home ice advantage they have. But a, and also the NBA playoffs not play the, a final starts tonight. Is it the NBA finals and the Stanley Cup final or was it Stanley Cup finals in the NBA final? I think it's the NBA finals. Um, every time I say something stupid, my phone rings. That's it right there. That's a little thing. All right. I have a call here in fucking, uh, let's see. 10 minutes, 10 minutes. So I'm gonna have to hit pause here. It's not gonna matter to you guys cause I'll just pick it up. You know, I'll give me 10 minutes of silence. Like I'm trying to do something artsy. Um, that starts tonight. Um,

Speaker 2:          00:12:52       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:12:53       I Dunno, I don't have a feeling on this one. I want the Cavaliers to win. Um,

Speaker 2:          00:12:59       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:12:59       I want the capitalist doing cause I still feel like they don't get their respect. People aren't talking about them like did the defending like they are the defending NBA champions and it's, it's cause Doran went to the warriors. I think that that's why nobody seems to be able to talk about it. You know what I mean? Just to be able to see like, hey not for nothing. These guys beat those other guys last year. So I hope they keep disrespecting them cause I always root against the pylon team. You know, I even did it with the red sox in 2007. I just, I don't even think I watched the world series. I mean obviously I was happy that we won. Obviously I'd rather see us win than the fucking Colorado Rockies. But I, I was just like, ah, this is, that's not competition. You know, having said that, having said that, when the, uh, when the bass, when the basketball and hockey season ends, okay, I'm getting the, the MLB package and I'm watching my $210 million Red Sox who are in second place, three games behind the evil empire that has nothing but their own homegrown talent.

Speaker 1:          00:14:07       And I'm going to watch that collision course and see how that goes. Um, I, I've learned this is what you have to do if you're a sports fan with some fairly big east is the baseball is such a great sport, but the problem is, is the first, almost the first half of the season is the most exciting time in basketball and hockey. And your emotions as a fan are so heightened, even if your team is out of it, just to watch, you know, there's always something great happens in the f in the final, unless, you know, the fucking ref called 38 files on one team at 15 on the other, then it sucks.

Speaker 2:          00:14:47       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:14:48       Letting it go. Um, and then all of a sudden it's over and then you settle.

Speaker 3:          00:14:56       Ah, just a bit outside a billable day. Pro Ball game.

Speaker 1:          00:15:00       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:15:00       I'll tell you his on base percentage is six 45. And uh, he's really seeing the ball right now. I kept you played the game. What was it like when you just, when you hit a zone like this? Oh, I'll tell you, you know, when you hit a all like, just to me that ball, I mean your eyes are as big as Christmas. You know, Jermaine, it just, it's like you can't, you just stick in the bat out there and the balls going away and wants to go, but you know, and uh, what do you want? How do you tell you to try to, uh, how do you try to stay in that zone? How you try to do I try to keep it go well, you know, it's one of those things you can't control it. You just, you learn is you, as you mature as a player to just try to enjoy those moments in a while. You know, you hope it goes, as long as it can put a Veggie, it is going to swing back to the other's way. And you just hope that that's is, uh, you know, that the slop doesn't last as long. So, uh, you know, you could, uh, keep your house in that gold digging whore that you met in a Tulsa when you're coming up and triple a that you knocked up and you don't really love, but you like her, you're hanging in there for the kid.

Speaker 1:          00:16:00       Um, you know, you gotta settle into that. So what you need to do is, uh, what do you, you gotta just immediately, you gotta slow everything the fuck down. And what you have to do is you gotta watch a day game. You gotta keep score while you smoke a cigar. You know, you get you lineup, you get it all ready to go. You just fucking sit there and you like the cigar about the third day, you know, and you just sit there and you fucking maybe even on the radio, listen to it on the radio and you just, it's like sports yoga. He just have to totally just calm your mind, fucking relax and then slide into the dog days of baseball, right? And then you ride that out for about six weeks and then all of a sudden it's NFL preseason. All right. And it's a preseason comes along.

Speaker 1:          00:16:52       You're excited about football. Cause every week's exciting because they only play 16 games, right? But baseball is also ramping up. So then when September comes along, it's like April, May, June with basketball and hockey, because now it's like you're so excited. How fuck NFL football, college football, it's coming back. I have a reason to live. Right? And the baseball race is heating up before you go in with Joe Buck and all the great October baseball. That's how you do it. Alright, so these next six weeks after the finals are over, you know, I'm telling you, I'll walk you through it on the podcast. You know, you pick a couple of alternative sports. Maybe you watch a little Roland Garris Little Wimbledon, you get into Formula One, maybe a little, a moto GP, right? I don't know what the fuck you got. [inaudible]

What happened was people used to be in the pharmaceutical industry, got into the fucking FDA and they're the ones who police to pharmaceutical companies.

Speaker 3:          00:27:47       And those cons just waved everything around like the third base coast that lost his vision, right? So then they let opiates into the fucking world. Now you've got a goddamn heroin epidemic. Okay. And now tiger woods is taken too many of those fucking things and he pulls over to the side of the road and everybody's saying it's because he did the fucking blonde haired blue eyed woman who evidently is a saint who took his fucking his, his master's money, bought a giant house, not the fucking thing down to buy something else. Where did all that material go? Where did all those fucking gold plated toilets go? They went right into the fucking ocean. Well, you know, but she's a victim. Oh, give me a break. That's it for the podcast. Signing off. Not fucking with the arm. I'm just trying to energy my way through the last bit of this a, what else do I have here to talk about?

Speaker 3:          00:28:36       Oh, you know what has a great new bits, a new bit I brought, his name is Charlie, Charlie Watts drummer for the rolling stones as a great new book out. That is just a drummers that influenced him. And if you're a drummer and you're into that shit because he's a, I guess a jazz drummer at heart. He talked about all these fucking great drummers that I've, I've heard most of the names and didn't know enough about him and the fact that he could break down their styles and what they did has made me a, I was already listening to a lot of that shit through some of my drum lessons, but really just trying to listen to the shit that he's saying. It's a great book. Um, let me, let me look it up here. I'm going to fucking hype his book here. You know, we've been trying to get Charlie Watson on this podcast for a long time. I know he doesn't do a lot of interviews and uh, but I know he'd want to come on my podcast. I'm joking. Charlie Watson Book. Let's see what we got here. Jelly.

Speaker 3:          00:29:32       You know the fucking Internet works in like two rooms in my fucking house. I spent all this money like can you give me the nuclear level fucking Internet so I can send out, beat out my neighbors. And you know, it works for a little while then that's it. Well, we sound, Shelly watch 10 things you didn't know about Charlie Watts. Why no books about Charlie Watts? You know, I'm usually good about fun. Charlie watts books, drummers influence book. You know, I nailed the John Daily search the last time. Come on for fuck sakes. Oh, Charlie Watts. Favorite drum. I, so it did come up, dude can get it for 12 bucks, $12 and 37 cents. Um,

Speaker 3:          00:30:21       whiplash, the film that puts the drummer in the limelight. Did I have to tell you guys how much I fucking hated that movie? I just hated watching somebody getting berated. It's just like fucking quit. Go join another band. Why would you sit there taking that level of shit from the guy and then not to mention the kids fucking technique. I, you had to look away when he was fucking playing real fast. He was making those faces. You could just feel the guy's forearms. Tighten up this guy. This guy's going to have carpal tunnel trying to please this complete cut. You know, and I gotta tell you the best drums from that year was not in that movie is great as the drums were the best fucking drums and some of the best drums I've heard in a movie, a mainstream moving along fucking time. Was that Michael Keaton movie. Um, what the fuck was that movie where he was the to form a superhero. The bird. Do you? Not Long. I watched that movie before I realized that was him in the costume talking to himself. Spoiler alert. All right, Michael Keaton. I'm just going to write bird.

Speaker 3:          00:31:26       Fuck you spell his name. I've only been watching this movies for 30 fucking years. Bill and Jesus Christ. Michael Keaton, bird bird man. Yo Birdman five. Oh. Um, who the fuck is the drummer in that? I know I talked about that before. The drums in that movie are fucking incredible. It's like, like that's what just a whole other level of drumming would. That guy is like, he's playing like moods. Hey supposed to just play in 90 million miles an hour all over the kid. That guy is, he sees, he's creating peaks and valleys. I mean that was like a [inaudible] that was literally a movie score just done with drums. I mean how many people can have that level of talent? I can tell you right now, I know, I don't, I already knew I didn't in the for the last three weeks cause I've been so damn busy, I've just been playing like, you know, not on a real drum kit, you know, little practice pad kit that I was playing on and I thought I was, you know, I thought I was doing something and then I went down and I played on a real fucking kitten.

Speaker 3:          00:32:31       Jesus Christ. Everything that you think you can, you can do drops by like 50 bpms. You know, it'd be basically like if you would just jogging on a treadmill being like, wow man, I couldn't run a seven minute mile. Then you go out to run down the street, you know, and you forgot about hills and shit and all of a sudden, you know, you can't run a seven minute mile anymore. Even if it was flat, flat level. Okay. Maybe if it was flat level, all of a sudden you run like a fucking 11 minute mile. That's what it's like. It was extremely fucking disheartening. And um, I'm doing the a, the comedy jam this weekend up in San Francisco for cluster fest, which is just completely like one of the biggest, I don't know how they afforded to, to, to get all of those comedians and bands and all of that.

Speaker 3:          00:33:17       They must've had a lot of ad money. Somebody who's doing something to establish that comedy festival going, we're going to go fucking, you know, nine zillion dollars in the hole to start it out. But uh, you might want to go this year because they're going big. Um, oh, and I almost forgot before I sign off your thank you to everybody who's been watching season two of f is for family. Um, got nothing but great reviews. You know, there's always a couple of country ones. What are you going to do? But overall you guys not only like it but you're saying you think it's even better than the first season, which for the amount of work that we put in, um, to hear that kind of feedback, you know, I know I'm a jerk a lot. That really means a lot to me. So thank you guys for not only watching it.

Speaker 3:          00:33:58       Thank you for the people that took the time to let me know how much you enjoyed it. Please let other people know about it. The more the people people know about it, the more people watch it and the better chance we have a possibly getting a third season. Um, and that's it. That's the podcast for this week. Have a great weekend. You can sit there and a is a little bit of a bit of music from Andrew thumbless and then we'll play a little half hour, some greatest hits from a Thursday or a podcast or whatever from Thursday gone by and maybe a Monday morning. I don't know what we're doing here. All right. That's not my part of the podcast. All right, I'll talk to you on Monday.

Speaker 2:          00:34:36       Hmm.

Speaker 5:          00:34:39       All right. Hey, this is the longest fucking revenge story I think I've ever read. Let me see if I can, uh, see if I can fucking just, I'm going to blow. I'm going to read that one next week when I have the energy. All right. Questions? All right, Bill. Uh, I have a question for you. I was hoping you might be able to shine some insight on this. I have this great friend that that's a girl mistake. Um, and we get along great and we have never had any sort of sexual tension or interest despite her being attractive. All right, dude, right there. You're either gay or you're, Oh, you're an idiot and I'm gonna try, I'm giving you some tough love here. That's a fucking stupid situation to be involved in. That's stupid. All right. Unless you're using her to attract other females to get you fucking late. Let's see if this is the case. I will continue reading. So she has this smoking hot friend. Oh, there we go. That met a few times

Speaker 3:          00:35:38       and always flirted with. But uh, but it's just been overall friendly. So this chicks calls me up one night and I'm at the bar at like midnight and asked if I want to stay up drinking with her and she come pick me up. So obviously I agree. Things go very good and we have a few drinks and flirt and when I make my move, she gets all upset. Like I should have known. She just wants to be friends when she calls me up at midnight to say to stay up drinking with her alone after the incident, the bitch still has the balls to sleep to ask to sleep over. Uh, since then I have noticed all our friends are trying to be my friend when all I want to do is rail the shit out of them. Bill, I was hoping you could, you should, you could shine some light on the situation and help me out. Yeah, dude, never have a friend as a, as a female,

Speaker 1:          00:36:29       you know.

Speaker 2:          00:36:31       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:36:32       You always gotta be fucking them. That's the only reason to be around them, you know? I know that's really sexist, but you know, I, I just, I'm speaking from me. There's no fucking point in hanging out with that level of frustration if you're not having sex with them. And if they're actually like a good friend, then that's the one that you should, uh, I mean that's the ultimate, if you're banging them and they're also a great friend, that's the one you marry because you've got a connection there. Right. But if you just,

Speaker 1:          00:37:05       yeah, I mean the, they using you as like a live teddy bear and um, yeah. The next time they call up, just be like, no, I'm, I'm not, I can't hang out tonight. What are you doing? I'm going to go out and try to get some ass tonight. I know I'm not getting any from you. And it's frustrating because you're hot and I want to bend you over every piece of fucking furniture in my apartment. Yay. I can't believe you said that. Yeah. Well, I just did. Are you going to come over here and fuck me? Well then great. I have to go. Why are you being so mean? I'm not being mean. I'm being honest. Okay. Do you have any times I've jerked off to you. It's fucking, it's annoying.

Speaker 2:          00:37:44       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:37:45       That you just, you just, I'm telling you like that's a little aggressive, but that's what you have to start doing. You just have to be straightforward and honest and don't do it. Like I just said it do if do it, how you can do it and pull it off and you just say it like that. Just be like, yeah, I want to go out. I want to try and get laid tonight. All right. And I go out with you and you're not fucking me. And then other girls see me with you and they think that I am fucking you, which I'm not. And I ended up going home, a dry humping my futon, you know? And it's really fucking with my self esteem. Okay. So that's it. So basically where you said, you say that you've had how to stack your cock, you know, I hang out with me.

Speaker 1:          00:38:24       Yes. That is what I'm saying. That's what I'm saying. Your conversations are awful, you know, I'm sure they're interesting to other females, but not to me. I don't want it to, I don't want to talk about that. I can give a shit about the hills, the o sea, the ocean, or whatever the fuck I was stupid. Show you what? I don't give a fuck. I don't give a fuck. I want to fuck you. Okay? It's worlds every day in orders. You have a seat. We'll watch the world series of poker. When you go all in, that's what you do. Just say what the fuck you want to do. You push all your chips in. Then you stand up and you start walking around. You wait for that next car to drop. You see what the fuck happens? Yeah, dude, that's my advice. Get out of that whole circle a VA.

Speaker 1:          00:39:06       He's like a big teddy bear. Fuck debt. Fuck Dad. All right. You're not a teddy bear or you are one right now. You've got to stop being that guy. So fuck all of them. Go. Uh, where are your guy friends? What are they doing? Go hang out with them. Go get a fucking wing man, get yourself back in the game and go out there and talk some shit. Hit on some girl you don't give a fuck about. So you can practice not giving a fuck and just say a bunch of shit that you would never say to some girl that you gave a shit about, eh, because you don't give a fuck up. The Girl Says No. Start with that. You know, always wear a condom. And uh, and that's it. That's what I would do. That's what I should've done. I didn't, I just have that knowledge now cause I'm fucking a, have I ever been the funeral home? I was never the front, but I was definitely the douchebag. I was definitely the, the, uh, not even pussy whipped was even pussy. What does this, I couldn't fucking speak up for myself. I was afraid of having a confrontation and then by the time I had the final confrontation, I was like, oh, I don't know. I was like, fuck in a year with this shit and we broke up. Um, but that's a whole nother thing.

Speaker 5:          00:40:12       Stories. Hey, what's up everybody? It's bill burner. This is the Monday morning podcast that I'm recording for the third time this week. Praying and hoping against hope that g CAS will actually upload this one cause I've already spent 90 minutes doing podcasts this week. So anyways, if you're hearing this, it means I successfully uploaded it. So there's no sense complaining unlike the rest of the people in my fucking life. You know you have it. Just have one of those weeks where everyone's just bitching at you. That's what I got. You know, that's what I'm dealing with right now. Like today's my girlfriend's birthday and she's, she was fucking pissed at me. [inaudible] she went absolutely psycho on me this morning. You know, it had nothing to do with me. Had nothing to fucking do with me. You know, I gave her a piece of cake last night, right at midnight Sanger, happy birthday because technically it was a birthday.

Speaker 5:          00:41:08       I gave her a pre birthday slice of cake and then I gave her a bag of Fritos with a little bow on it. Right. Just being a silly jackass. Like that's all you get in for your birthday. Right? And everything was going great. I was a big sweetheart. And then I woke up this morning and made the mistake of telling her that I had made a dinner reservation yet. And then she starts flipping out acting like I'm just throwing her goddamn birthday together when I gave her a pre birthday fucking slice of birthday cake, you know, start flipping out. Know I don't know why she was flipping out. It's like, it's fucking Tuesday. It's a Tuesday. It's not a holiday. This who the fuck is going out tonight? June 2nd. Oh Shit. Was it Cinco de Mayo? You know, is it a fuss? I'm fucking New Zealand holiday that I don't know about.

Speaker 5:          00:42:01       There's going to be plenty of fucking reservations and lo and behold, after she flips out, you know, screaming at me. Right? So all my neighbors think that I'm beating her. Women love doing that Shit. They just put on this big fucking show. Right? And then afterwards they just gone thigh. I got a little crazy. I don't know. I think just, you don't hate me, dare you. You forgive me. They do that shit. Right. Meanwhile, you know, your neighbors don't hear that part. They don't hear the part where they sort of say really quietly that they flipped out for no fucking reason. You know, all they heard was to screaming and yelling. So now I'm going to get the looks today I'm going to go down to the garage. You know, like it's the 1920s like I should become walking out with like a fucking wife beater.

Speaker 5:          00:42:45       You know, as I reattached the belt to my pants, so this is what happens, right? I ended up calling up this fucking restaurant, this, this, Nah, one of the nicest steak houses out here in la. I call him up. I said, hey, I'd like a reservation for two people. I go, okay, sir, what time would you like? I said, how about eight? I can't do anything at aide. How about eight 30 and I said, you know what sweetheart, that would be perfect. And she said, okay, and that was it. That's all I had to fucking do. But for some reason, because I didn't do that before her birthday, that means that I don't give a fuck. That's how fucking nuts women are. She absolutely, she actually flipped out on me at 10 o'clock in the morning on her birthday. She didn't give me a chance to fuck the day up.

Speaker 5:          00:43:40       She did a preemptive strike. Even though I gave her a pre birthday slice of cake, I sang happy birthday. I made a shut arise. I put, I put out the lights, I lit a candle. I came in, I sang happy birthday and I gave her a bag of Fritos, which is fucking ridiculous and silly. It was great. And tonight she's getting a real gift, if you know what I mean. Oh. Um, you know, so it's one of those deals where I'm laying in bed and then all of a sudden she, ah, it's just fucking ridiculous, you know? But I didn't back down. I didn't back down. I, you know, actually when she really got mad, why she started flipping out is because she, when she was screaming at me, I was laughing. You know, I don't know if any other guy out there has that problem you ever had any like when your girlfriend starts yelling at you, your first is just to start laughing.

Speaker 5:          00:44:34       I Dunno why. Every time my girl yells at me, I instantly feel like I'm in school again and I'm like in in second grade and I'm getting yelled at and it's just, and my friends are laughing at me. That's, that's what I feel like. I feel ridiculous. Okay. I guess that's what it is. When when a woman yells at me, I always feel ridiculous. You don't want a guy yells at me. I get mad because I think, oh fuck, this guy's going to beat the shit out of me. So you got to get into that energy. But when a girl woman is just sitting there, hey,

Speaker 6:          00:45:04       hey,

Speaker 5:          00:45:08       what are you supposed to do? You know, I'm not going to yell back at you. You're a woman. I don't want to feel like a bully. We're not going to get physical. You're a woman. You know it's stupid. Stop yelling that fucking high pitch voice. You sound like a fucking, he's all like Mickey Mouse. Sit Down, relax, collect your thoughts, make a list. If you have to tell me why you're upset, you know, but don't just sit there fucking yelling at me like you just took a hit off a helium balloon because it just sounds hilarious. Especially when I haven't done anything wrong and I got a great fucking gift this year. That's what was killing me. That actually I actually had that moment during the fight where I said, you want your gift, fine. And I went out and I pull it out. It's already wrapped with a bow on it. You know, sitting there acting like I'm not fucking prepared. There's your fucking present. Bam wrapped with a fucking bow on it.

Speaker 5:          00:46:08       Jesus. Everybody giving me shit. I remember last week when I called that woman a douchebag. Remember the douchebag of the week last week cause she was giving me shit once again, a female surprise. Surprise was giving me shit that when I read the underrated over aids or the questions people have, I wouldn't say what sex they were. And she somehow found out a way to kind of, I don't know, make me look like I was some chauvinist that I guess she felt if it was a good question, I credited a guy and uh, you know, it's a free podcast. Alright, stop being so fucking conti. So she became douchebag of the week. So evidently she didn't like it. And what does she do? She sends me an email, his email, she sends me a bill. It's nice that you named me douchebag of the week. I don't really give a shit because I always mean what I write.

Speaker 5:          00:47:04       I didn't know what that means cause I always mean what I write. Oh really? What are the rest of us just faking it? We're just joking around but not you yourself fucking serious is anyways, evidently this psycho. This is a new segment. This is cy. I can't, I can't figure it out. This is a love letter of the week or a psycho of the week. I don't know. You guys name it. I don't give a shit. So anyway, she goes, I don't really give a shit because I always mean what I write and it seems you're just talking shit about two things that I wrote that seemed bitchy. Now I was talking about your entire email. Don't try to knock it down. All right, continuing here she goes call me account. But I really don't give a fuck. You've read a lot of my comments previously and agreed with them or had a good response to them.

Speaker 5:          00:47:44       I'm literally fixing her sentences because she doesn't know how to write here. But it's nice that you a will consider telling the gender of the person who, uh, who the comments are from. And I know you have a shit load of people who listen to your podcast, but I got you some more since my friends who heard the podcast thought it was fucking hilarious and then they started listening to you. So you really should be thanking me. Isn't this just typical, this is just all going to be woman bashing this week. Isn't this just typical of a fucking female? You know what I mean? She's getting something every week, every week that is free. And she still found a way to bitch about it. Okay. And then when I call her out for being a douchebag, now she's actually trying to make me feel guilty. Yeah, I just, you know, you can call me a douchebag now.

Speaker 5:          00:48:33       Whatever. I mean he just even, I got a whole bunch of friends to listen to you. I mean probably should be thanking me, but you know, that's okay. Shut up. Just shy. I swear to God. Why? Why can't you slap women? You know, back in the day, how great did that feel? You know you have on the wife Beater, the wind blowing through your armpit hair, his you just crack. I know it's evil. I don't give a fuck. Fuck all you guys. I don't give a shit. This is the rest of her email. Okay. Before you think I'm an asshole. This is what she wrote. This is actually so psychotic. It's hilarious. She writes and yeah, I do know that the name shows up on the email even if I don't sign it. But you just make it seem like you that much of a retard to notice.

Speaker 5:          00:49:17       That's literally what she wrote. And then she wrote your over 40 and have the vocabulary of a seventh grader. Your is spelled y, o U. R. All right, for all you morons out there, your y o u r is possessive meaning like that's your shirt. Okay. If you're saying your over 40 that's you are. Okay. So that means if you're going to say your, it's an apostrophe. Y O u a pause to free our e. So if you're a dumb fuck like this woman, if you don't know the next time you go to write your just stop and see if you are would still fit. All right? Like your over 40 you are over 40 okay. Right there. You know you got to use the apostrophe as as opposed to saying your over 40 so what is over do I own over you? Dumb fuck.

Speaker 5:          00:50:17       But I do have the vocabulary of a seventh grade but you know something, you have the fucking vocabulary for third grader. All right, your over 40 and you had the vocabulary of a seventh grader, you recognize real words. How hilarious is this? And she's misspelling stuff. You started when you read and I hope your dog outlives you and you die lonely because of your inability to commit and therefore never achieve the comedic fame of the Great George Carlin. So Simon says, go fuck yourself sense, it sounds like you have major brain damage. All right sweetheart, I'm really going to try to help you out here. Okay? If you hope that my dog outlives me and then you say, and then I die lonely. Okay. If I'm going to die before my dog, mathematically the fucking dog is still gonna be there. So how am I going to be lonely?

Speaker 5:          00:51:12       You know, the dog would have to die first or run away. So what you should say is, I hope you dog outlives you then runs away and then you die by yourself as opposed to saying, I hope your dog outlives you when you die. Lonely. Now I would die before my dog and be sitting there licking my face and my last few pathetic moments, and then evidently because of my inability to commit to a relationship, I'll never achieve the comedic fame of George Carlin. Oh, that totally makes sense. It has nothing to do with the fact that I wasn't blessed with his gifts as a comedian, you know, all you have to do to be as good as George Carlin is just commit to a relationship to some psycho fucking chick like you. All right, lady. These are podcasts. These are jokes. When I call somebody a Douchebag, I'm just fucking around so I don't take it seriously, but if you want to, you and your friends can go fuck yourselves and go listen to another podcast.

Speaker 5:          00:52:01       All right. Stop trying to threaten me like you're going to take podcasts. Listen, there's listeners away. I don't give a shit. This is free. What are you guys going to take away advertising dollars from me? I don't give a fuck. Fuck you and your friends. I hope you're all listening it together. Fuck all of you. Look around the room. Look into each one of your eyes. I'm saying fuck all of you. You know what's funny is your friends are probably laughing at you right now going, you know what she has? She has kind of a comment. She really is like that. She does have a tendency, I know I shouldn't use that word, but I'm serious. She has, she can be real cunty sometimes and she has a tendency to exaggerate things that aren't really happening in fact in here. Okay. All right. So that's the first hate mail.

Speaker 5:          00:52:42       So I figured, you know what, why don't I seek out, I'll try to find some other hate mail. Here's one that I got on youtube. This is a nice one. Um, basically I, uh, there's a clip on there from me from about eight years ago, which he'll obviously notice cause I'm skinnier and have a full head of hair. And I'm doing this bit about joining the military, saying how, you know, when you watch the commercials for the military, it makes you want to join. You know, they make it look like everybody gets their own jet. Everybody's driving a tank. Everyone's doing some top gun shit. Everyone's having a, you know, you're a fucking navy seal. You get your face painted and you're clinging to that raft and you comment up out of the water, like fucking Rambo into the mud and shit. That's what they make you look like.

Speaker 5:          00:53:28       Right. But what they don't show is all the other jobs that, you know, you go in there and you think you're going to be like, you know, Tom Cruise, oh my God, my dog just farted. Jesus Christ, Cleo. You know? Could you at least like, you don't kills me about this dog when it farts is it, it doesn't even have the decency that fucking kind of make a face like, yeah, that was me. Sorry about that. She doesn't lays here. Good Lord. At least it's silent. You know? It's the worst is when you have a dog that farts like a person ever been over somebody's house and the dogs and a corner, they just go like, it is like, really. Anyways, so that was the bit, so the bit is yeah, you, you, you, you see the commercial and you sign up, you thinking, yeah, I'm going to be like Tom Cruise in top gun and then you show up and you ended up being that guy.

Speaker 5:          00:54:18       You know when the jet takes off, you just like point in the same direction that the jet's going or they give you those, those orange glow sticks from a rave. You know when the plane comes in, you're that guy, you put the air in the tires on the jet, you know, you joined and next thing you know you're standing there with like a camouflage weed whacker. Wait, wait, gay man. Yeah, that was a joke. Okay. Simple joke. I actually did the joke at a military base and I also did it at one of the VA hospitals and if fucking killed, you know what I mean? So this guy of course has to go all Fox News on Youtube and this is what he writes is actually kind of funny. He writes you on grateful bitch. And then he puts in quotes, if you're dumb enough to join the military.

Speaker 5:          00:55:02       Dot. Dot. Dot, which is classic of somebody who wants to take a joke seriously as they don't write. The whole joke is they just take not even a sentence. They just take a part of a sentence. Okay. So he writes, if you're dumb enough to join the military dot, dot. Dot. And then he writes in capital letters. Fact, fact is, if it wasn't for the bravery of the American servicemen and the American spirit throughout history, I like the American spirit. What do you mean chicks who go to a fucking bake sale? Um, anyways, you wouldn't even get, you wouldn't even have the right to mock those sacrifices which have been made for you. And if you did, you would probably be doing it in German. So respect your American servicemen because it is him in which you owe your freedoms to take to that what people came, you know, half the time people think I'm a morons, cause people can't even write a sentence because it is him in which you owe your freedoms to that you take so foolishly for granted. That's word for word. I appreciate the sacrifices of other, you coward.

Speaker 5:          00:56:11       Uh, you know, at what point did I make fun of servicemen? I didn't, I was making fun of the how fucking whatever. You know something. If you guys want to take jokes seriously, I don't give a fuck and I, I'm really sick. That hacky thing where someone goes, you know, and they did it for you and if you didn't, you'd be speaking German right now. That's how dumb people are. You know, they're just used to say that you'd be speaking German right now is a hacky fucking reference. You're just saying that because you heard someone else say it. You know, why wouldn't I be speaking like I was from England? Why wouldn't I be speaking a Spanish right now? You know, we did fight other countries, Mexican American war. How come that one never gets brought up? I can, I wouldn't be speaking Korean. I mean, granted they weren't over here, but you know what I'm saying? I'm so sick of fucking idiots who speak in sound bites like everyone who like makes fun of France. Yeah, we full conceived jurors. [inaudible]

Speaker 5:          00:57:10       read a history book. We were paying them back for saving our ass with England. You dumb fucks. So now we're even all right, whatever. Look at me. I'm getting all upset here cause people are morons. All right, let's, let's move onto saline. Let's, let's get to some information here for the week. All right. Um, last week I was at, Oh, here's going out. Last week I was at teasing firefighters and I was talking about how, uh, you know, 20 trucks show up to every fire. Why does that happen? How much do those trucks cost? And a volunteer firefighter wrote in, he said a up it up. A De I. Yes. How much a fire trucks cost fire engines, which put the water out. Uh Oh wait, put the water out. Fire engines, which put water out. I think I'm dyslexic. Um, typically run between 300,000 and $600,000. Fire trucks also called ladder trucks run between 400,000 and 800,000.

Speaker 5:          00:58:05       The two main differences between the low and high numbers is the make of the truck and the equipment. It comes with a fire engine with all the hoses added on and the breathing apparatus is more expensive than without. All right. Well here's a question I have with for you. You saved the make of the truck. So, uh, I guess what Mack truck, that's a reputable bank. Reputable law brand as opposed to what? A High Hyundai fire firetruck. I guess that that's what it is. I don't even know what the fuck they are. But anyways, you asked us, you asked why so many pieces of apparatus show up to a call a, there are a few reasons for this. Sometimes it's manpower. In my case, we have three fire companies consisting of six pieces of apparatus. Since we volunteer, they may not be enough volunteers in town at any one time.

Speaker 5:          00:58:53       So all three companies get banged out, banged out, equals called out in firefighting terms. Typically at least four pieces show up for a call. This allows us to have all the equipment we need at the scene. Sometimes you just never know what you're going to need. All right, fair enough. Uh, but perhaps the best reason this is great here, but perhaps the best reason is that sometimes we are called for what amounts to be in the end. Absolutely nothing. About six months ago, my pager went your pager, Jesus Christ. Dude, is your firetruck pulled by a couple of horses? Who the fuck still has a picture?

Speaker 5:          00:59:31       I know he's going to write back. Girl, should we just special fucking nine 11 pager for firemen? I right. I'm a moron. I get it. All right. How about six months ago, my pager went off for, for a working house fire at 2:00 AM I jumped awake and flew down, uh, to the firehouse. We got on the scene. We saw no smoke or flames in, uh, in speaking with the residents, they had just woke up and saw a reflection in their mirror that they thought was a fire. So here's all six of our apparatus showing up for absolutely nothing, or the time we called for, for lightning, hit lightning, hitting a house on a clear summer night. The woman heard something and thought it was lightening hitting her house. People are fucking idiots all over. Hope that helps. And even though I am a firefighter, you're firefighter jokes were funny.

Speaker 5:          01:00:21       See, they as a cool guy. He see their sweetheart. Even though he's a firefighter, he sees the joke. He realizes. I'm just telling jokes out, right? There you go. People how we learned something this week. All right, you want to learn something else then I'm going to wrap up this fucking podcast. I'm gonna know it's really short this week, but at w I don't understand what the point of me keep babbling for fucking 50 minutes. If G Cass won't upload, the files are right. Here's some computer tips for the week. Uh, here's some computer tips on web searching. All right, Bill, when you want to find something that, uh, that you are Google it, what? That makes no sense. All right? When you Google, use the plus and the minus signs to find the shit you want. So this is how it works. If you want to search something with uh, plus in front of it, then it will have to contain the word.

Speaker 5:          01:01:16       And if you want to put a minus in front of it that were removed the word from the listing. So basically put the plus in front of the word that you're searching, that you want to find an a minus in front of the one that you don't want. For example, I want to see how many sites have bill burr on it while limit while eliminating bilber from, uh, from the search. So you would Google the plus sign plus my name bill, then the plus sign, and then you write bur minus bill bird.com and the results will, uh, will show sites that can AV content with bill burr on it and not include bill bird.com. Huh? Isn't that interesting? I didn't know that shit. And he said, I'm listed on seven hundred thousand seven hundred six thousand web pages, not including my website. 706,000 websites have my name on it and I still can't sell up the third show on Saturday night. What the fuck is going on? All right. Unless you find some shit out, like uh, if you want to find some shit out like to do to you. I can't read what you guys write. If you want to find some shit out, like to you do when you are on what? I can't even paraphrase that.

Speaker 5:          01:02:34       If you want to find some shit out like to you do now like you do when you're on the podcast. All right? You had an extra word in there, dude. If you want to find some shit out like you do when, uh, you're on the podcasts, use the above option, the plus, minus or or use quotes. All right? You wanted to find the names of female serial killers a few weeks ago. Just put quotes around a phrase and it will only show sites that contain all phrases. Okay, I get it. You know, like you guys ever go to search something and you're like, you'll just write female serial killers and then a bunch of, uh, hits will come out and you have a bunch that just say female and a bunch, several just say serial and other one would just say killers or whatever. Yeah. I guess if you put quotes around it, that puts it all together.

Speaker 5:          01:03:26       You know what? That's very helpful. I know this part of the s the podcast. Isn't that funny? But God damn it, we, you know, we got to learn something here. All right. I should've got some water here. My fucking mouth is dry as hell. All right, let's wrap up the podcast here. Uh, this is the Syrah killer topic. Bill, if you want to be a serial killer, uh, and use the best weapon you have to use ice. If you stab someone with an icicle or beat someone to death with ice, then it melts and you have no murder weapon or fingerprints, no DNA or fingerprint problems. Oh yeah. That guy who, uh, that talked about tracking you down with the type of soil where it was located and the type of wood used and all that shit is exactly that bullshit. They watch too many shows.

Speaker 5:          01:04:07       CSI does not do that shit. I know, Dude. We all knew he was just fucking around. He was making fun of how, when you watch those shows. Um, all right, what else do we got here? Question. Uh, Bill, you say that you play the drums. Um, if you could, uh, play the drums in any band, living or dead for one show, one night, only in any city in the world, who would you play and in what city? Okay. Fuck. Um, Jesus Christ, it would either be led Zepplin you know what's funny is I think I would have a better, better chance faking what John Bonam does than what Phil Rudd does in ACDC. Fulfill red does is so fucking difficult. If you play drums to just sit there going, boom, crack, boom, crack for fucking two hours straight. Um, yeah, I think I would play, I would play with led Zeppelin.

Speaker 5:          01:05:02       I do it in England at Royal Albert Hall. And I would, and I would play on that, that the Ludwig, uh, that maple drum kit that he played, either that or his green sparco kit. I don't like the Vista Vista light kit he had, or the, uh, the stainless steel one. I liked the two ones that he had. I play on either one of those and somehow I would sound as good as can I, can I, can I have that as part of the fantasy that I would actually sound as good as he would sound? You know, that's what I would do. Um, and then I'd get fucking some 1969 groupie pussy afterwards. All right, next question, Bill. Um, would you rather be respected, be a respected comedian who never makes it really big like so-and-so and So-and-so, I'm not going to name the names a, he named two people who are millionaires playing theaters, but I guess who can still walk down the street, he said, or would you rather be a one trick pony like a blah, blah, blah, who has written, uh, one catch phrase to fame and fortune and has more cash than he can ever spend?

Speaker 5:          01:06:03       Oh No, I'd much rather be respected by my peers without a fucking doubt. Without a doubt. I would a, you know, you can become a really big comedian and not necessarily be super fun. Like that's the great thing about entertainment is you, it's easy to become, I can't say it's easy, but you can become a millionaire and still not be famous. You know what I'm saying? And I always use this, this example, like that Sitcom Caroline in the city, they actually made it to syndication. And the entire cast could walk by me on a walking down the street and I would recognize any of them. So I would, you know, Dude, you're a millionaire. How much fucking money do you need? And I also think the more I look at these people being super, super famous is I just doesn't look like a good time to me.

Speaker 5:          01:06:53       You know, I think I would, I want to be a millionaire who has notoriety, which means maybe two, three times a month, somebody goes a year, that comedian, I really like what you do. And then Yay, thanks a lot. Then I go back to eating my omelette. I'd rather do that than fucking, uh, I dunno. You know, I, I don't, I don't ever want to fucking have to step out of a limo with no panties on. You know what I mean? Just so I can maintain fame at that fucking level. Do you think that would whinge, do you think that that would be miserable? I mean, other than when you're at the, the, the fucking Celtics game and you have court side seats in that moment, that's fucking awesome. You know what I mean? I've always used this analogy, but it's someday at some point you're going to have to fucking blow out a bathroom in public and you don't want to be famous at that point. You know, you just want to be like, dude, you can have some fucking guy just blew. You don't want a bill burns just blew out the bathroom.

Speaker 5:          01:07:52       They literally put a fucking name to it. It's brutal. Um, all right. Overrated or underrated, really quickly. Overrated beer with the lime already in it. No joke. It just tastes fucking gross. Um, what else do I got here? I'm sorry, this is really fucking unraveling here. I just, I, I, I've done, I've done this too many times this fucking week. I don't mind. I lost my passion. Like if Pau Gasol was doing a fucking podcast, this is what it would sound like right now. You know, and I'd be thumping my chest acting like I'm giving you entertainment right now and I'm not, you know, that's what I'm going to end with this week. What do we got here? I'm 28 minutes in. Good. I'll keep it under 30 minutes. I'm going to end with this prediction. I think Orlando is going to beat the Lakers and I think that they, they're going to beat them in six games because uh, they don't have anybody to stop.

Speaker 5:          01:08:39       Dwight Howard and I think Turco Lou is a, I dunno, I think that guy's going to get enough points and then they got that other guy, the number two or is he the point guard? I don't know shit about basketball. I just fucking hate the Lakers. So I'm going to go out on a limb here with no money down or nothing. I'm not going out on a limb. I just, I just think I got a feeling I got a fucking feeling. All right. I think Van van Gundy is going to out show. He's going to out coach Phil Jackson. Phil Jackson, he's making home videos with his girlfriend, his new hot young girlfriend on the, on his way to the staples center. Every night. They're soft, they're fucking soft. All they have is Coby Kobe's to shit. I love Coby, but I think his teammates are scared of them. I think they're scared to fuck up around them.

Speaker 5:          01:09:21       They're scared to disappoint them. Uh, and they just get freaked out and they just pass him the ball. That's what I think is gonna happen. Pago Saul gets the most quietest, 15 fucking rebounds and the quietest 20 points a game. I think he's gonna. He's gonna take a fucking Dwight Howard elbow to his bearded chops sometime in game two and the Orlando's gonna win game two. They got three in a row in Orlando. They're going to win two out of three and then they're going to come back and they're going to beat the heartless Lakers in the staple center. Game Six. What the fuck do you guys think about that? Huh? You liked that one?

Speaker 5:          01:09:55       You know, what do you guys think about the two, three, two play a format? I think it's bullshit. I think the, they give the advantage to the weaker team because the Lakers should have home court. Right? And I don't think they do with a two, three, two format because when it's two, three, two the pressure is on the home team for the first two games. Right. If it was two, two, one, one, one like they used to do back in back in the day you open the first two games, the pressure are on our Lando to steal one. Now when it's two, three, two the, the pressures on the Lakers, they have to win both of those fucking games. They can't go one, one and then path to play three fucking games in Orlando. Right. My out of my mind, and this is, is this all getting boring?

Speaker 5:          01:10:41       While I don't give a fuck cause this is my third one this week. Listen, my goddamn mouth is dry. Um, so anyways, I might Abdu do another podcast this week as I might have a very special announcement of something that I might be doing next week that might be on television. How do you like that? I'm leaving you with a little cliffhanger. Um, and with that, I don't have any gigs until, uh, the third week in July when I'm going to be at the comedy works in Denver. Um, why is that? Um, I booked a very small part in a very big, and, um, I dunno, I'm shooting like five, six days on it, but they had to clear out my [inaudible] my schedule because they're working around famous people's schedules. So I'm low man on the totem pole. So, uh, I gladly cleared out my Spec, my a schedule. So, uh, I'll let you know what the name of the movie is and all that type of shit, when in fact, I know that I haven't been cut out of it. How's that? All right. And that's the, a very short, very succinct Monday morning podcast this week. The third fucking time I'm praying to God that this thing is going to actually get published. All right, you guys have a good weekend. Thanks to everybody who came out to the Improv a couple of weekends ago out here in Hollywood. All right, that's it. Take it easy. Take it easy.
