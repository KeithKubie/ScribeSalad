00:24:23.820 --> 00:24:23.830
for example border seizure numbers
 

00:24:23.830 --> 00:24:27.509
for example border seizure numbers
if seizures go up dramatically customs

00:24:27.509 --> 00:24:27.519
if seizures go up dramatically customs
 

00:24:27.519 --> 00:24:29.220
if seizures go up dramatically customs
that Homeland Security gets applauded

00:24:29.220 --> 00:24:29.230
that Homeland Security gets applauded
 

00:24:29.230 --> 00:24:31.019
that Homeland Security gets applauded
but if seizures go up dramatically

00:24:31.019 --> 00:24:31.029
but if seizures go up dramatically
 

00:24:31.029 --> 00:24:32.669
but if seizures go up dramatically
frankly it also might mean there's a lot

00:24:32.669 --> 00:24:32.679
frankly it also might mean there's a lot
 

00:24:32.679 --> 00:24:34.230
frankly it also might mean there's a lot
more drugs coming across the border

00:24:34.230 --> 00:24:34.240
more drugs coming across the border
 

00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:36.149
more drugs coming across the border
because all things be equal you're going

00:24:36.149 --> 00:24:36.159
because all things be equal you're going
 

00:24:36.159 --> 00:24:38.730
because all things be equal you're going
to seize more if there's more drugs so

00:24:38.730 --> 00:24:38.740
to seize more if there's more drugs so
 

00:24:38.740 --> 00:24:40.139
to seize more if there's more drugs so
there's this weird symbiosis between

00:24:40.139 --> 00:24:40.149
there's this weird symbiosis between
 

00:24:40.149 --> 00:24:42.600
there's this weird symbiosis between
increased drug trafficking and showing

00:24:42.600 --> 00:24:42.610
increased drug trafficking and showing
 

00:24:42.610 --> 00:24:44.279
increased drug trafficking and showing
that you're doing a good job if suddenly

00:24:44.279 --> 00:24:44.289
that you're doing a good job if suddenly
 

00:24:44.289 --> 00:24:45.930
that you're doing a good job if suddenly
you were weren't seizing and the drug

00:24:45.930 --> 00:24:45.940
you were weren't seizing and the drug
 

00:24:45.940 --> 00:24:47.820
you were weren't seizing and the drug
trade disappeared at least in the short

00:24:47.820 --> 00:24:47.830
trade disappeared at least in the short
 

00:24:47.830 --> 00:24:49.740
trade disappeared at least in the short
term it would look pretty pretty awkward

00:24:49.740 --> 00:24:49.750
term it would look pretty pretty awkward
 

00:24:49.750 --> 00:24:54.299

and they're also our big fights about

and they're also our big fights about
 

00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:39.380
and they're also our big fights about
whether or not the national data matches

sort of north-south politics happening
 

00:26:43.700 --> 00:26:45.740
sort of north-south politics happening
one of the problems is that the

00:26:45.740 --> 00:26:45.750
one of the problems is that the
 

00:26:45.750 --> 00:26:47.360
one of the problems is that the
international data may measure things

00:26:47.360 --> 00:26:47.370
international data may measure things
 

00:26:47.370 --> 00:26:49.279
international data may measure things
differently than the national data so

00:26:49.279 --> 00:26:49.289
differently than the national data so
 

00:26:49.289 --> 00:26:51.710
differently than the national data so
for example the life expectancy in South

00:26:51.710 --> 00:26:51.720
for example the life expectancy in South
 

00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:54.289
for example the life expectancy in South
Africa by the international figures is

00:26:54.289 --> 00:26:54.299
Africa by the international figures is
 

00:26:54.299 --> 00:26:57.889
Africa by the international figures is
47 and by the national figures is 57

00:26:57.889 --> 00:26:57.899
47 and by the national figures is 57
 

00:26:57.899 --> 00:26:59.389
47 and by the national figures is 57
well that's pretty significant and these

00:26:59.389 --> 00:26:59.399
well that's pretty significant and these
 

00:26:59.399 --> 00:27:00.799
well that's pretty significant and these
numbers all get folded into the

00:27:00.799 --> 00:27:00.809
numbers all get folded into the
 

00:27:00.809 --> 00:27:02.299
numbers all get folded into the

development growth so South Africa cares
 

00:27:06.899 --> 00:27:10.399
development growth so South Africa cares
a lot so south africa morocco and brazil

00:27:10.399 --> 00:27:10.409
a lot so south africa morocco and brazil
 

00:27:10.409 --> 00:27:15.260
a lot so south africa morocco and brazil
have all accused the UNDP of changing

these numbers not paying attention to
 

00:27:17.309 --> 00:27:20.600
these numbers not paying attention to
the official statistics I've tried to

00:27:20.600 --> 00:27:20.610
the official statistics I've tried to
 

00:27:20.610 --> 00:27:21.980
the official statistics I've tried to
figure out what official statistics are

00:27:21.980 --> 00:27:21.990
figure out what official statistics are
 

00:27:21.990 --> 00:27:23.450
figure out what official statistics are
and those turn out to be things that

00:27:23.450 --> 00:27:23.460
and those turn out to be things that
 

00:27:23.460 --> 00:27:25.760
and those turn out to be things that
countries produce so if UN agencies

the UNDP guy said they are official
apparently the worst offense is that

00:27:32.060 --> 00:27:32.070
apparently the worst offense is that
 

00:27:32.070 --> 00:27:35.419
apparently the worst offense is that
some of the data that the UNDP used for

some of the data that the UNDP used for

some of the data that the UNDP used for

the new human development index was
 

00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:39.200
the new human development index was
produced by some scholars in one of

and i know laura is going to talk about
this as well but numbers also are about

this moving into the global domain so

00:34:28.850 --> 00:34:28.860
this moving into the global domain so

they're looking at and I actually

00:34:39.770 --> 00:34:39.780
they're looking at and I actually

are also uncountable but what does it

00:34:45.680 --> 00:34:45.690
are also uncountable but what does it
 

00:34:45.690 --> 00:34:47.630
are also uncountable but what does it
mean that we are providing numbers we've

00:34:47.630 --> 00:34:47.640
mean that we are providing numbers we've
 

00:34:47.640 --> 00:34:49.760

some money is a sex worker she came back

00:35:20.250 --> 00:35:20.260
some money is a sex worker she came back
 

00:35:20.260 --> 00:35:21.990
some money is a sex worker she came back
home she found a friend she won't take

00:35:21.990 --> 00:35:22.000
home she found a friend she won't take
 

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:23.850
home she found a friend she won't take
the friend with her is that trafficking

00:35:23.850 --> 00:35:23.860
the friend with her is that trafficking
 

00:35:23.860 --> 00:35:25.830
the friend with her is that trafficking
you know we know the trafficking is

00:35:25.830 --> 00:35:25.840
you know we know the trafficking is
 

00:35:25.840 --> 00:35:27.930
you know we know the trafficking is
often about people who move and then

00:35:27.930 --> 00:35:27.940
often about people who move and then
 

00:35:27.940 --> 00:35:29.970
often about people who move and then
maybe they can't get a job and they go

00:35:29.970 --> 00:35:29.980
maybe they can't get a job and they go
 

00:35:29.980 --> 00:35:31.350
maybe they can't get a job and they go
into sex work for a while and then they

00:35:31.350 --> 00:35:31.360
into sex work for a while and then they
 

00:35:31.360 --> 00:35:33.780
into sex work for a while and then they
go to other work so identifying the

00:35:33.780 --> 00:35:33.790
go to other work so identifying the
 

00:35:33.790 --> 00:35:36.180
go to other work so identifying the
thing right that trafficked person is

00:35:36.180 --> 00:35:36.190
thing right that trafficked person is
 

00:35:36.190 --> 00:35:37.950
thing right that trafficked person is
extremely difficult even at the ground

00:35:37.950 --> 00:35:37.960
extremely difficult even at the ground
 

00:35:37.960 --> 00:35:40.070
extremely difficult even at the ground
but nevertheless we are trying to do it

00:35:40.070 --> 00:35:40.080
but nevertheless we are trying to do it
 

00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:43.380
but nevertheless we are trying to do it
so they're clearly a lot of problematic

00:35:43.380 --> 00:35:43.390
so they're clearly a lot of problematic
 

00:35:43.390 --> 00:35:46.260
so they're clearly a lot of problematic
and political dimensions to the creation

00:35:46.260 --> 00:35:46.270
and political dimensions to the creation
 

00:35:46.270 --> 00:35:49.440
and political dimensions to the creation
of dissemination of numbers and we need

00:35:49.440 --> 00:35:49.450
of dissemination of numbers and we need
 

00:35:49.450 --> 00:35:51.780
of dissemination of numbers and we need
lots more skepticism and scrutiny but

00:35:51.780 --> 00:35:51.790
lots more skepticism and scrutiny but
 

00:35:51.790 --> 00:35:54.270
lots more skepticism and scrutiny but
what I might call a GRE factor here is

00:35:54.270 --> 00:35:54.280
what I might call a GRE factor here is

want to give you a brief overview of a

00:35:58.740 --> 00:35:58.750
want to give you a brief overview of a
 

00:35:58.750 --> 00:36:00.900
want to give you a brief overview of a
whole different problematic which is

00:36:00.900 --> 00:36:00.910
whole different problematic which is
 

00:36:00.910 --> 00:36:05.250
whole different problematic which is
that number creation is done over a long

00:36:05.250 --> 00:36:05.260
that number creation is done over a long
 

00:36:05.260 --> 00:36:07.230
that number creation is done over a long
period of time often I mean an indicator

00:36:07.230 --> 00:36:07.240
period of time often I mean an indicator
 

00:36:07.240 --> 00:36:09.930
period of time often I mean an indicator

want to take ALA Torian perspective

00:36:17.610 --> 00:36:17.620
want to take ALA Torian perspective

bruno latour talks about the creation of

00:36:19.680 --> 00:36:19.690
bruno latour talks about the creation of
 

00:36:19.690 --> 00:36:21.660
bruno latour talks about the creation of
scientific knowledge which is a process

00:36:21.660 --> 00:36:21.670
scientific knowledge which is a process
 

00:36:21.670 --> 00:36:24.240
scientific knowledge which is a process
that takes place over time in which

00:36:24.240 --> 00:36:24.250
that takes place over time in which
 

00:36:24.250 --> 00:36:26.610
that takes place over time in which
issues that are uncertain become settled

00:36:26.610 --> 00:36:26.620
issues that are uncertain become settled
 

00:36:26.620 --> 00:36:28.200
issues that are uncertain become settled
and then you can move on build on those

00:36:28.200 --> 00:36:28.210
and then you can move on build on those
 

00:36:28.210 --> 00:36:30.210
and then you can move on build on those
and you get more and more settlement of

00:36:30.210 --> 00:36:30.220
and you get more and more settlement of
 

00:36:30.220 --> 00:36:32.490
and you get more and more settlement of
ideas and then new questions and then

00:36:32.490 --> 00:36:32.500
ideas and then new questions and then
 

00:36:32.500 --> 00:36:34.650
ideas and then new questions and then
they become settled so for example how

00:36:34.650 --> 00:36:34.660
they become settled so for example how
 

00:36:34.660 --> 00:36:36.450
they become settled so for example how
to measure temperature we didn't know we

00:36:36.450 --> 00:36:36.460
to measure temperature we didn't know we
 

00:36:36.460 --> 00:36:38.490
to measure temperature we didn't know we
invented the thermometer we now figure

00:36:38.490 --> 00:36:38.500
invented the thermometer we now figure
 

00:36:38.500 --> 00:36:39.450
invented the thermometer we now figure
that the thermometer measures

00:36:39.450 --> 00:36:39.460
that the thermometer measures
 

00:36:39.460 --> 00:36:40.920
that the thermometer measures
temperature and we don't really worry

00:36:40.920 --> 00:36:40.930
temperature and we don't really worry
 

00:36:40.930 --> 00:36:42.780
temperature and we don't really worry
about whether that's true or not and you

00:36:42.780 --> 00:36:42.790
about whether that's true or not and you
 

00:36:42.790 --> 00:36:44.400
about whether that's true or not and you
see the same thing if you look at the

00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:44.410
see the same thing if you look at the
 

00:36:44.410 --> 00:36:46.350
see the same thing if you look at the
genealogies of indicator production

00:36:46.350 --> 00:36:46.360
genealogies of indicator production
 

00:36:46.360 --> 00:36:48.690
genealogies of indicator production
there are things that are debated and

00:36:48.690 --> 00:36:48.700
there are things that are debated and
 

00:36:48.700 --> 00:36:50.730
there are things that are debated and
contested and then after a while they

00:36:50.730 --> 00:36:50.740
contested and then after a while they
 

00:36:50.740 --> 00:36:53.280
contested and then after a while they
sort of become settled and accepted but

00:36:53.280 --> 00:36:53.290
sort of become settled and accepted but
 

00:36:53.290 --> 00:36:54.930
sort of become settled and accepted but
my argument is that there are multiple

00:36:54.930 --> 00:36:54.940
my argument is that there are multiple
 

00:36:54.940 --> 00:36:57.270
my argument is that there are multiple
ways that this settlement and acceptance

00:36:57.270 --> 00:36:57.280
ways that this settlement and acceptance
 

00:36:57.280 --> 00:36:59.280
ways that this settlement and acceptance
can take place and if you look at

00:36:59.280 --> 00:36:59.290
can take place and if you look at
 

00:36:59.290 --> 00:37:00.870
can take place and if you look at
different ones you can see they have

00:37:00.870 --> 00:37:00.880
different ones you can see they have
 

00:37:00.880 --> 00:37:02.430
different ones you can see they have
very different assumptions about what

00:37:02.430 --> 00:37:02.440
very different assumptions about what
 

00:37:02.440 --> 00:37:05.220
very different assumptions about what
the point is what you're measuring what

00:37:05.220 --> 00:37:05.230
the point is what you're measuring what
 

00:37:05.230 --> 00:37:06.870
the point is what you're measuring what
the institution who cares about it is

00:37:06.870 --> 00:37:06.880
the institution who cares about it is
 

00:37:06.880 --> 00:37:08.730
the institution who cares about it is
and what you're doing about it so I've

00:37:08.730 --> 00:37:08.740
and what you're doing about it so I've
 

00:37:08.740 --> 00:37:10.860
and what you're doing about it so I've
been studying how to measure violence

00:37:10.860 --> 00:37:10.870
been studying how to measure violence
 

00:37:10.870 --> 00:37:13.500
been studying how to measure violence
against women globally and that's what

00:37:13.500 --> 00:37:13.510
against women globally and that's what
 

00:37:13.510 --> 00:37:16.590
against women globally and that's what
my points about and I have figured out

00:37:16.590 --> 00:37:16.600
my points about and I have figured out
 

00:37:16.600 --> 00:37:19.050
my points about and I have figured out
so this is about this is part of the new

00:37:19.050 --> 00:37:19.060
so this is about this is part of the new
 

00:37:19.060 --> 00:37:20.460
so this is about this is part of the new
governance I'm going

00:37:20.460 --> 00:37:20.470
governance I'm going
 

00:37:20.470 --> 00:37:22.020
governance I'm going
fast because I'm not going to talk about

00:37:22.020 --> 00:37:22.030
fast because I'm not going to talk about
 

00:37:22.030 --> 00:37:25.470
fast because I'm not going to talk about
this and these are ways of collecting

00:37:25.470 --> 00:37:25.480
this and these are ways of collecting
 

00:37:25.480 --> 00:37:28.680
this and these are ways of collecting
data these are all very murky but it

00:37:28.680 --> 00:37:28.690
data these are all very murky but it
 

00:37:28.690 --> 00:37:30.630
data these are all very murky but it
seems to me that if we're looking at how

00:37:30.630 --> 00:37:30.640
seems to me that if we're looking at how
 

00:37:30.640 --> 00:37:32.730
seems to me that if we're looking at how
to measure violence against women there

00:37:32.730 --> 00:37:32.740
to measure violence against women there
 

00:37:32.740 --> 00:37:35.070
to measure violence against women there
are four different approaches which are

00:37:35.070 --> 00:37:35.080
are four different approaches which are
 

00:37:35.080 --> 00:37:36.870
are four different approaches which are
quite different in their philosophy

00:37:36.870 --> 00:37:36.880
quite different in their philosophy
 

00:37:36.880 --> 00:37:39.000
quite different in their philosophy
their goals the organization's behind

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:39.010
their goals the organization's behind
 

00:37:39.010 --> 00:37:41.550
their goals the organization's behind
them one focus on gender equality one on

00:37:41.550 --> 00:37:41.560
them one focus on gender equality one on
 

00:37:41.560 --> 00:37:43.470
them one focus on gender equality one on
human rights 10 criminal justice and one

00:37:43.470 --> 00:37:43.480
human rights 10 criminal justice and one
 

00:37:43.480 --> 00:37:45.420
human rights 10 criminal justice and one
on national statistical capacity and

00:37:45.420 --> 00:37:45.430
on national statistical capacity and
 

00:37:45.430 --> 00:37:47.910
on national statistical capacity and
each one of these has assumptions about

00:37:47.910 --> 00:37:47.920
each one of these has assumptions about
 

00:37:47.920 --> 00:37:49.980
each one of these has assumptions about
what causes the problem how to fix it

00:37:49.980 --> 00:37:49.990
what causes the problem how to fix it
 

00:37:49.990 --> 00:37:51.920
what causes the problem how to fix it
how to get information which

00:37:51.920 --> 00:37:51.930
how to get information which
 

00:37:51.930 --> 00:37:53.849
how to get information which
institutions are going to support it

00:37:53.849 --> 00:37:53.859
institutions are going to support it
 

00:37:53.859 --> 00:37:56.750
institutions are going to support it
what kinds of expertise they value and

00:37:56.750 --> 00:37:56.760
what kinds of expertise they value and
 

00:37:56.760 --> 00:37:59.970
what kinds of expertise they value and
what constitutes improvement and so if

00:37:59.970 --> 00:37:59.980
what constitutes improvement and so if
 

00:37:59.980 --> 00:38:02.160
what constitutes improvement and so if
we look at the trajectory of development

00:38:02.160 --> 00:38:02.170
we look at the trajectory of development
 

00:38:02.170 --> 00:38:03.750
we look at the trajectory of development
of each of these over time you find

00:38:03.750 --> 00:38:03.760
of each of these over time you find
 

00:38:03.760 --> 00:38:05.040
of each of these over time you find
they're actually measuring something

00:38:05.040 --> 00:38:05.050
they're actually measuring something
 

00:38:05.050 --> 00:38:06.480
they're actually measuring something
quite different if you think about

00:38:06.480 --> 00:38:06.490
quite different if you think about
 

00:38:06.490 --> 00:38:08.190
quite different if you think about
violence against women for a moment this

00:38:08.190 --> 00:38:08.200
violence against women for a moment this
 

00:38:08.200 --> 00:38:10.050
violence against women for a moment this
is not a simple and straightforward

00:38:10.050 --> 00:38:10.060
is not a simple and straightforward
 

00:38:10.060 --> 00:38:11.910
is not a simple and straightforward
category it includes everything from

00:38:11.910 --> 00:38:11.920
category it includes everything from
 

00:38:11.920 --> 00:38:13.980
category it includes everything from
domestic violence to honor killing to

00:38:13.980 --> 00:38:13.990
domestic violence to honor killing to
 

00:38:13.990 --> 00:38:18.750
domestic violence to honor killing to
trafficking to various kinds of ritual

00:38:18.750 --> 00:38:18.760
trafficking to various kinds of ritual
 

00:38:18.760 --> 00:38:21.599
trafficking to various kinds of ritual
things to female genital cutting etc so

00:38:21.599 --> 00:38:21.609
things to female genital cutting etc so
 

00:38:21.609 --> 00:38:23.880
things to female genital cutting etc so
to be very brief this may be too quick

00:38:23.880 --> 00:38:23.890
to be very brief this may be too quick
 

00:38:23.890 --> 00:38:26.220
to be very brief this may be too quick
so the first model is one of gender

00:38:26.220 --> 00:38:26.230
so the first model is one of gender
 

00:38:26.230 --> 00:38:27.750
so the first model is one of gender
equality and this is an argument that

00:38:27.750 --> 00:38:27.760
equality and this is an argument that
 

00:38:27.760 --> 00:38:30.000
equality and this is an argument that
says if you're going to get gender

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:30.010
says if you're going to get gender
 

00:38:30.010 --> 00:38:31.950
says if you're going to get gender
equality you have to diminish violence

00:38:31.950 --> 00:38:31.960
equality you have to diminish violence
 

00:38:31.960 --> 00:38:34.170
equality you have to diminish violence
or actually violence may produce gender

00:38:34.170 --> 00:38:34.180
or actually violence may produce gender
 

00:38:34.180 --> 00:38:36.450
or actually violence may produce gender
inequality this is kind of a feminist

00:38:36.450 --> 00:38:36.460
inequality this is kind of a feminist
 

00:38:36.460 --> 00:38:38.579
inequality this is kind of a feminist
approach so you want to get focusing on

00:38:38.579 --> 00:38:38.589
approach so you want to get focusing on
 

00:38:38.589 --> 00:38:40.790
approach so you want to get focusing on

these various frameworks and at that
 

00:42:09.140 --> 00:42:11.230
these various frameworks and at that
point it became clear to me that there's

00:42:11.230 --> 00:42:11.240
point it became clear to me that there's
 

00:42:11.240 --> 00:42:13.120

a whole lot more money to do crime

00:42:13.120 --> 00:42:13.130
a whole lot more money to do crime
 

00:42:13.130 --> 00:42:15.940
a whole lot more money to do crime
surveys or national statistical surveys

00:42:15.940 --> 00:42:15.950
surveys or national statistical surveys
 

00:42:15.950 --> 00:42:19.030
surveys or national statistical surveys
then there is to do feminists gender

00:42:19.030 --> 00:42:19.040
then there is to do feminists gender
 

00:42:19.040 --> 00:42:21.190
then there is to do feminists gender
equality surveys or Human Rights surveys

00:42:21.190 --> 00:42:21.200
equality surveys or Human Rights surveys
 

00:42:21.200 --> 00:42:24.400
equality surveys or Human Rights surveys
so what this means is that of these four

00:42:24.400 --> 00:42:24.410
so what this means is that of these four
 

00:42:24.410 --> 00:42:26.800
so what this means is that of these four
options it's the second to that are

00:42:26.800 --> 00:42:26.810
options it's the second to that are
 

00:42:26.810 --> 00:42:28.990
options it's the second to that are
going to actually happen and now that I

00:42:28.990 --> 00:42:29.000
going to actually happen and now that I
 

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:30.460
going to actually happen and now that I
realize that I can see that the

00:42:30.460 --> 00:42:30.470
realize that I can see that the
 

00:42:30.470 --> 00:42:32.020
realize that I can see that the
feminists are busy trying to persuade

00:42:32.020 --> 00:42:32.030
feminists are busy trying to persuade
 

00:42:32.030 --> 00:42:33.850
feminists are busy trying to persuade
the National Statistical people to put

00:42:33.850 --> 00:42:33.860
the National Statistical people to put
 

00:42:33.860 --> 00:42:35.350
the National Statistical people to put
their questions into their questionnaire

00:42:35.350 --> 00:42:35.360
their questions into their questionnaire
 

00:42:35.360 --> 00:42:37.960
their questions into their questionnaire
because in the end resources differ and

00:42:37.960 --> 00:42:37.970
because in the end resources differ and
 

00:42:37.970 --> 00:42:39.850
because in the end resources differ and
so the organizations that have more

00:42:39.850 --> 00:42:39.860
so the organizations that have more
 

00:42:39.860 --> 00:42:42.400
so the organizations that have more
resources and the more capacity to do

00:42:42.400 --> 00:42:42.410
resources and the more capacity to do
 

00:42:42.410 --> 00:42:44.170
resources and the more capacity to do
this kind of survey are going to be the

00:42:44.170 --> 00:42:44.180
this kind of survey are going to be the
 

00:42:44.180 --> 00:42:45.970
this kind of survey are going to be the
ones that end up deciding how the

00:42:45.970 --> 00:42:45.980
ones that end up deciding how the
 

00:42:45.980 --> 00:42:49.090
ones that end up deciding how the
phenomenon is defined how it is counted

00:42:49.090 --> 00:42:49.100
phenomenon is defined how it is counted
 

00:42:49.100 --> 00:42:52.030
phenomenon is defined how it is counted
how it is understood how it's theorized

00:42:52.030 --> 00:42:52.040
how it is understood how it's theorized
 

00:42:52.040 --> 00:42:54.790
how it is understood how it's theorized
and how the solution is imagined and I

00:42:54.790 --> 00:42:54.800
and how the solution is imagined and I
 

00:42:54.800 --> 00:42:57.010
and how the solution is imagined and I
think these kinds of policy implications

00:42:57.010 --> 00:42:57.020
think these kinds of policy implications
 

00:42:57.020 --> 00:42:58.960
think these kinds of policy implications
are really important for us to think

00:42:58.960 --> 00:42:58.970
are really important for us to think
 

00:42:58.970 --> 00:43:01.120
are really important for us to think
about but they're really embedded in the

00:43:01.120 --> 00:43:01.130
about but they're really embedded in the
 

00:43:01.130 --> 00:43:03.130
about but they're really embedded in the
whole trajectory of how measurement

00:43:03.130 --> 00:43:03.140
whole trajectory of how measurement
 

00:43:03.140 --> 00:43:05.920
whole trajectory of how measurement
processes take place so I'm sorry that

00:43:05.920 --> 00:43:05.930
processes take place so I'm sorry that
 

00:43:05.930 --> 00:43:07.540
processes take place so I'm sorry that
was so fast but I hope you could get

00:43:07.540 --> 00:43:07.550
was so fast but I hope you could get
 

00:43:07.550 --> 00:43:13.420
was so fast but I hope you could get
something out of it thanks so I'm

foundations and I started this
initiative at the at Open Society

00:43:20.770 --> 00:43:20.780
initiative at the at Open Society
 

00:43:20.780 --> 00:43:22.510

Foundations as a joint project between
 

00:43:22.520 --> 00:43:25.780
Foundations as a joint project between
two different programs specifically to

00:43:25.780 --> 00:43:25.790
two different programs specifically to
 

00:43:25.790 --> 00:43:27.370
two different programs specifically to
address what i think are some of the

00:43:27.370 --> 00:43:27.380
address what i think are some of the
 

00:43:27.380 --> 00:43:28.540
address what i think are some of the
underlying questions in the book

00:43:28.540 --> 00:43:28.550
underlying questions in the book
 

00:43:28.550 --> 00:43:30.640
underlying questions in the book
although I don't primarily deal with

00:43:30.640 --> 00:43:30.650
although I don't primarily deal with
 

00:43:30.650 --> 00:43:32.470
although I don't primarily deal with
statistics I deal a lot with this issue

00:43:32.470 --> 00:43:32.480
statistics I deal a lot with this issue
 

00:43:32.480 --> 00:43:35.140
statistics I deal a lot with this issue
of data I'll talk a little bit more

00:43:35.140 --> 00:43:35.150
of data I'll talk a little bit more
 

00:43:35.150 --> 00:43:37.300
of data I'll talk a little bit more
about the initiative in a bit because it

00:43:37.300 --> 00:43:37.310
about the initiative in a bit because it
 

00:43:37.310 --> 00:43:40.330
about the initiative in a bit because it
is sort of relevant but I think what

00:43:40.330 --> 00:43:40.340
is sort of relevant but I think what
 

00:43:40.340 --> 00:43:41.950
is sort of relevant but I think what
we're seeing here and what I saw as I

00:43:41.950 --> 00:43:41.960
we're seeing here and what I saw as I
 

00:43:41.960 --> 00:43:44.440
we're seeing here and what I saw as I
went through the book and what created

00:43:44.440 --> 00:43:44.450
went through the book and what created
 

00:43:44.450 --> 00:43:46.690
went through the book and what created
my my impulse to start the initiative

my my impulse to start the initiative
 

00:43:46.700 --> 00:43:49.840
my my impulse to start the initiative
was sort of a deep shift in global

00:43:49.840 --> 00:43:49.850
was sort of a deep shift in global

and information technology so we're

00:43:52.930 --> 00:43:52.940
and information technology so we're
 

00:43:52.940 --> 00:43:54.240
and information technology so we're
coming for the perspective that

00:43:54.240 --> 00:43:54.250
coming for the perspective that
 

00:43:54.250 --> 00:43:56.320
coming for the perspective that

then actually assist organizations and

00:43:58.360 --> 00:43:58.370
then actually assist organizations and
 

00:43:58.370 --> 00:44:00.430
then actually assist organizations and
particularly human rights organizations

00:44:00.430 --> 00:44:00.440
particularly human rights organizations

to address some of the some of the
 

00:44:03.110 --> 00:44:04.420
to address some of the some of the
policy questions they encounter when

they're asked well how many victims of
 

00:44:09.110 --> 00:44:10.870
they're asked well how many victims of
domestic violence are there and you know

domestic violence are there and you know
 

00:44:10.880 --> 00:44:12.600
domestic violence are there and you know
they really have to be able to make this

00:44:12.600 --> 00:44:12.610
they really have to be able to make this
 

00:44:12.610 --> 00:44:15.880
they really have to be able to make this
to do some manoeuvring to position their

their current access to what I would say
 

00:44:18.350 --> 00:44:21.790
their current access to what I would say
is a fire hose of available data coming

00:44:21.790 --> 00:44:21.800
is a fire hose of available data coming
 

00:44:21.800 --> 00:44:23.980
is a fire hose of available data coming
from multiple sources and really frame

00:44:23.980 --> 00:44:23.990
from multiple sources and really frame
 

00:44:23.990 --> 00:44:26.430

documentation and research has been done
 

00:44:28.400 --> 00:44:32.230
documentation and research has been done
all along there is a strong methodology

00:44:32.230 --> 00:44:32.240
all along there is a strong methodology
 

00:44:32.240 --> 00:44:36.750
all along there is a strong methodology
to human rights data collection and in

00:44:36.750 --> 00:44:36.760
to human rights data collection and in
 

00:44:36.760 --> 00:44:39.310
to human rights data collection and in
and in reality we really have to make

00:44:39.310 --> 00:44:39.320
and in reality we really have to make
 

00:44:39.320 --> 00:44:41.860
and in reality we really have to make
sure that when we talk about statistics

00:44:41.860 --> 00:44:41.870
sure that when we talk about statistics
 

00:44:41.870 --> 00:44:43.840
sure that when we talk about statistics
indicators numbers and metrics we are

00:44:43.840 --> 00:44:43.850
indicators numbers and metrics we are
 

00:44:43.850 --> 00:44:45.250
indicators numbers and metrics we are
really actually looking at them through

00:44:45.250 --> 00:44:45.260
really actually looking at them through
 

00:44:45.260 --> 00:44:47.770
really actually looking at them through
the framework of what a documented human

00:44:47.770 --> 00:44:47.780
the framework of what a documented human
 

00:44:47.780 --> 00:44:50.410

prevent protect and preserve so I found

00:44:55.120 --> 00:44:55.130
prevent protect and preserve so I found
 

00:44:55.130 --> 00:44:57.130
prevent protect and preserve so I found
the book really interesting because I'm

00:44:57.130 --> 00:44:57.140
the book really interesting because I'm
 

00:44:57.140 --> 00:44:58.120
the book really interesting because I'm
not used to looking through my glasses

00:44:58.120 --> 00:44:58.130
not used to looking through my glasses
 

00:44:58.130 --> 00:45:00.550
not used to looking through my glasses
on I found the book really interesting

00:45:00.550 --> 00:45:00.560
on I found the book really interesting
 

00:45:00.560 --> 00:45:01.810
on I found the book really interesting
because it sort of confirmed for me that

00:45:01.810 --> 00:45:01.820
because it sort of confirmed for me that
 

00:45:01.820 --> 00:45:04.050
because it sort of confirmed for me that
both on the academic and policy side

00:45:04.050 --> 00:45:04.060
both on the academic and policy side
 

00:45:04.060 --> 00:45:06.190
both on the academic and policy side
we're seeing a lot of the same questions

00:45:06.190 --> 00:45:06.200
we're seeing a lot of the same questions
 

00:45:06.200 --> 00:45:07.720
we're seeing a lot of the same questions
that the human rights and governance and

00:45:07.720 --> 00:45:07.730
that the human rights and governance and
 

00:45:07.730 --> 00:45:11.080
that the human rights and governance and
and and policy actors on the NGO side

00:45:11.080 --> 00:45:11.090
and and policy actors on the NGO side
 

00:45:11.090 --> 00:45:12.340
and and policy actors on the NGO side
are really confronting which are their

00:45:12.340 --> 00:45:12.350
are really confronting which are their
 

00:45:12.350 --> 00:45:13.840
are really confronting which are their
concerns about numbers and metrics and

00:45:13.840 --> 00:45:13.850
concerns about numbers and metrics and
 

00:45:13.850 --> 00:45:16.960
concerns about numbers and metrics and
indices I think that it's it's given us

00:45:16.960 --> 00:45:16.970
indices I think that it's it's given us
 

00:45:16.970 --> 00:45:21.780
indices I think that it's it's given us
this these like three or four kind of

00:45:21.780 --> 00:45:21.790
this these like three or four kind of
 

00:45:21.790 --> 00:45:24.190
this these like three or four kind of
kind of questions or challenges that

00:45:24.190 --> 00:45:24.200
kind of questions or challenges that
 

00:45:24.200 --> 00:45:25.810
kind of questions or challenges that
we've seen in terms of what human rights

00:45:25.810 --> 00:45:25.820
we've seen in terms of what human rights
 

00:45:25.820 --> 00:45:29.530
we've seen in terms of what human rights
practice can do and so I wanted to I

00:45:29.530 --> 00:45:29.540
practice can do and so I wanted to I
 

00:45:29.540 --> 00:45:30.880
practice can do and so I wanted to I
wanted to just give you a little bit of

00:45:30.880 --> 00:45:30.890
wanted to just give you a little bit of
 

00:45:30.890 --> 00:45:33.390
wanted to just give you a little bit of
a little taste of what those might be in

00:45:33.390 --> 00:45:33.400
a little taste of what those might be in
 

00:45:33.400 --> 00:45:35.410
a little taste of what those might be in
terms of how they focus on technology

00:45:35.410 --> 00:45:35.420
terms of how they focus on technology
 

00:45:35.420 --> 00:45:37.210
terms of how they focus on technology
but also in how they do they deal with

00:45:37.210 --> 00:45:37.220
but also in how they do they deal with
 

00:45:37.220 --> 00:45:41.290
but also in how they do they deal with
data basically the first the first

00:45:41.290 --> 00:45:41.300
data basically the first the first
 

00:45:41.300 --> 00:45:42.970
data basically the first the first
challenge I would say is that the

00:45:42.970 --> 00:45:42.980
challenge I would say is that the
 

00:45:42.980 --> 00:45:44.500
challenge I would say is that the
investigatory tradition of human rights

00:45:44.500 --> 00:45:44.510
investigatory tradition of human rights
 

00:45:44.510 --> 00:45:47.950
investigatory tradition of human rights
work follows this methodology and we

00:45:47.950 --> 00:45:47.960
work follows this methodology and we
 

00:45:47.960 --> 00:45:49.770
work follows this methodology and we

final piece that I wanted to bring up
 

00:47:17.600 --> 00:47:20.650
final piece that I wanted to bring up
was this question about sort of the

00:47:20.650 --> 00:47:20.660
was this question about sort of the
 

00:47:20.660 --> 00:47:24.700
was this question about sort of the
globalized environment of of that they

00:47:24.700 --> 00:47:24.710
globalized environment of of that they
 

00:47:24.710 --> 00:47:27.730
globalized environment of of that they
work in terms of AG advocacy we've seen

00:47:27.730 --> 00:47:27.740
work in terms of AG advocacy we've seen
 

00:47:27.740 --> 00:47:29.200

over time that many human rights

00:47:29.200 --> 00:47:29.210
over time that many human rights
 

00:47:29.210 --> 00:47:30.370
over time that many human rights
organizations are concerned that the

00:47:30.370 --> 00:47:30.380
organizations are concerned that the
 

00:47:30.380 --> 00:47:31.930

understanding what they're doing at an
international level and partly that may

00:47:35.320 --> 00:47:35.330
international level and partly that may
 

00:47:35.330 --> 00:47:36.580
international level and partly that may
be because they're confronting something

00:47:36.580 --> 00:47:36.590
be because they're confronting something
 

00:47:36.590 --> 00:47:37.930

that they haven't quite quote-unquote

so there's an opportunity as well for
 

00:47:44.870 --> 00:47:47.560
so there's an opportunity as well for
new tools and tactics and new types of

initiative was was created to kind of

00:48:02.170 --> 00:48:02.180
initiative was was created to kind of
 

00:48:02.180 --> 00:48:04.230

address these threats and challenges and
there's three pieces that we sort of see

00:48:06.670 --> 00:48:06.680
there's three pieces that we sort of see
 

00:48:06.680 --> 00:48:08.800
there's three pieces that we sort of see
I was Lego blocks or I don't know and

kind of they build off of each other

00:48:12.220 --> 00:48:12.230
kind of they build off of each other
 

00:48:12.230 --> 00:48:14.620
kind of they build off of each other
let's go with that the first is about

00:48:14.620 --> 00:48:14.630
let's go with that the first is about
 

00:48:14.630 --> 00:48:15.640
let's go with that the first is about
rebuilding information infrastructure

00:48:15.640 --> 00:48:15.650
rebuilding information infrastructure
 

00:48:15.650 --> 00:48:16.960
rebuilding information infrastructure
which is pretty simple and

00:48:16.960 --> 00:48:16.970
which is pretty simple and
 

00:48:16.970 --> 00:48:18.730
which is pretty simple and
straightforward the question there is

00:48:18.730 --> 00:48:18.740
straightforward the question there is
 

00:48:18.740 --> 00:48:21.820
straightforward the question there is
about how do we enable more powerful

00:48:21.820 --> 00:48:21.830
about how do we enable more powerful
 

00:48:21.830 --> 00:48:22.930
about how do we enable more powerful
ways for organ

00:48:22.930 --> 00:48:22.940
ways for organ

ways for organ
physicians to preserve their data but

00:48:24.339 --> 00:48:24.349
physicians to preserve their data but
 

00:48:24.349 --> 00:48:25.630
physicians to preserve their data but
also how do we enable them to engage

00:48:25.630 --> 00:48:25.640
also how do we enable them to engage
 

00:48:25.640 --> 00:48:29.200
also how do we enable them to engage
with larger sets of data both numbers

00:48:29.200 --> 00:48:29.210
with larger sets of data both numbers
 

00:48:29.210 --> 00:48:33.400
with larger sets of data both numbers
and and other types of information the

00:48:33.400 --> 00:48:33.410
and and other types of information the
 

00:48:33.410 --> 00:48:34.960
and and other types of information the
second is about extending the use of

00:48:34.960 --> 00:48:34.970
second is about extending the use of
 

00:48:34.970 --> 00:48:36.579
second is about extending the use of
human rights information which means

00:48:36.579 --> 00:48:36.589
human rights information which means
 

00:48:36.589 --> 00:48:38.530
human rights information which means
developing data supported outputs to

00:48:38.530 --> 00:48:38.540
developing data supported outputs to
 

00:48:38.540 --> 00:48:40.260
developing data supported outputs to
enhance and extend narrative reporting

00:48:40.260 --> 00:48:40.270
enhance and extend narrative reporting
 

00:48:40.270 --> 00:48:43.300
enhance and extend narrative reporting
and then developing data outputs that

00:48:43.300 --> 00:48:43.310
and then developing data outputs that
 

00:48:43.310 --> 00:48:45.490
and then developing data outputs that
can be shared collaboratively so a human

00:48:45.490 --> 00:48:45.500
can be shared collaboratively so a human
 

00:48:45.500 --> 00:48:47.589
can be shared collaboratively so a human
rights organization cannot produce the

00:48:47.589 --> 00:48:47.599
rights organization cannot produce the
 

00:48:47.599 --> 00:48:49.510
rights organization cannot produce the
type of data that a statistical survey

00:48:49.510 --> 00:48:49.520
type of data that a statistical survey
 

00:48:49.520 --> 00:48:54.550
type of data that a statistical survey
may need but that data has to be remix

00:48:54.550 --> 00:48:54.560
may need but that data has to be remix
 

00:48:54.560 --> 00:48:57.069
may need but that data has to be remix
in such a way that it remains relevant

00:48:57.069 --> 00:48:57.079
in such a way that it remains relevant
 

00:48:57.079 --> 00:48:59.950
in such a way that it remains relevant
to this inevitable narrative that we see

00:48:59.950 --> 00:48:59.960
to this inevitable narrative that we see
 

00:48:59.960 --> 00:49:02.470

of numbers and number demand for numbers
 

00:49:02.480 --> 00:49:04.599
of numbers and number demand for numbers
that we see and then the final piece

00:49:04.599 --> 00:49:04.609
that we see and then the final piece
 

00:49:04.609 --> 00:49:06.609
that we see and then the final piece
that we want to concentrate on is we're

00:49:06.609 --> 00:49:06.619
that we want to concentrate on is we're
 

00:49:06.619 --> 00:49:09.160
that we want to concentrate on is we're

to assist them to move forward with that

to assist them to move forward with that
can actually complicate what has been

can actually complicate what has been
 

00:49:46.130 --> 00:49:48.609
can actually complicate what has been
this straightforward narrative about how

this straightforward narrative about how
 

00:49:48.619 --> 00:49:50.740
this straightforward narrative about how
many numbers can we throw on the table

00:49:50.740 --> 00:49:50.750
many numbers can we throw on the table
 

00:49:50.750 --> 00:49:54.250
many numbers can we throw on the table
and and use to base our policies off of

and and use to base our policies off of

and and use to base our policies off of
and then the final piece is that we do

00:49:56.230 --> 00:49:56.240
and then the final piece is that we do
 

00:49:56.240 --> 00:49:57.670
and then the final piece is that we do
get a lot of questions about whether

00:49:57.670 --> 00:49:57.680
get a lot of questions about whether
 

00:49:57.680 --> 00:49:58.870
get a lot of questions about whether
we're working on statistics and we're

00:49:58.870 --> 00:49:58.880
we're working on statistics and we're
 

00:49:58.880 --> 00:50:01.030
we're working on statistics and we're
really not the the the majority of our

00:50:01.030 --> 00:50:01.040
really not the the the majority of our
 

00:50:01.040 --> 00:50:03.760
really not the the the majority of our
work isn't really about statistics and i

00:50:03.760 --> 00:50:03.770
work isn't really about statistics and i
 

00:50:03.770 --> 00:50:05.470
work isn't really about statistics and i
think that there's a conflation between

think that there's a conflation between
 

00:50:05.480 --> 00:50:07.510

policymakers as well as NGOs come across
and so that's a final piece of advocacy

00:50:13.270 --> 00:50:13.280
and so that's a final piece of advocacy
 

00:50:13.280 --> 00:50:15.069
and so that's a final piece of advocacy
which is shaping that shaping that

that I wanted to just throw out there
these are initial thoughts i'm going to

00:50:23.800 --> 00:50:23.810
these are initial thoughts i'm going to
 

00:50:23.810 --> 00:50:26.440
these are initial thoughts i'm going to
reread it but the first is that the

00:50:26.440 --> 00:50:26.450
reread it but the first is that the
 

00:50:26.450 --> 00:50:28.180
reread it but the first is that the
pressure to produce numbers is really

00:50:28.180 --> 00:50:28.190
pressure to produce numbers is really
 

00:50:28.190 --> 00:50:29.829
pressure to produce numbers is really
real and it's very real for ngos

00:50:29.829 --> 00:50:29.839
real and it's very real for ngos
 

00:50:29.839 --> 00:50:32.230
real and it's very real for ngos
themselves it's it's real in terms of

themselves it's it's real in terms of
 

00:50:32.240 --> 00:50:35.770
themselves it's it's real in terms of
their their need to explain to their

donors what it
 

00:50:36.410 --> 00:50:39.550
donors what it
they do but it's also really it's also

00:50:39.550 --> 00:50:39.560
they do but it's also really it's also
 

00:50:39.560 --> 00:50:40.990
they do but it's also really it's also
really hard to say no when you're

00:50:40.990 --> 00:50:41.000
really hard to say no when you're
 

00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:43.990
really hard to say no when you're
invited to the table and if that

00:50:43.990 --> 00:50:44.000
invited to the table and if that
 

00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:45.520

please tell us how many how do we
 

00:50:47.360 --> 00:50:48.790
please tell us how many how do we
measure and how do we say how many

victims there are of a certain crime
 

00:50:51.110 --> 00:50:53.950
victims there are of a certain crime
it's hard to let that go I think we

00:50:53.950 --> 00:50:53.960
it's hard to let that go I think we
 

00:50:53.960 --> 00:50:55.380
it's hard to let that go I think we
brought up before this question of

00:50:55.380 --> 00:50:55.390
brought up before this question of
 

00:50:55.390 --> 00:50:59.860
brought up before this question of
grabbing the attention of your advocacy

00:50:59.860 --> 00:50:59.870

target or of even the press I think that

00:51:03.250 --> 00:51:03.260
target or of even the press I think that
 

00:51:03.260 --> 00:51:07.750
target or of even the press I think that
it's clear to me that organizations

00:51:07.750 --> 00:51:07.760
it's clear to me that organizations
 

00:51:07.760 --> 00:51:09.160
it's clear to me that organizations
really shouldn't be producing and

00:51:09.160 --> 00:51:09.170
really shouldn't be producing and
 

00:51:09.170 --> 00:51:10.480
really shouldn't be producing and
collecting statistics if they're not set

00:51:10.480 --> 00:51:10.490
collecting statistics if they're not set
 

00:51:10.490 --> 00:51:13.440
collecting statistics if they're not set
up for it and but I think what's really

00:51:13.440 --> 00:51:13.450
up for it and but I think what's really
 

00:51:13.450 --> 00:51:15.820
up for it and but I think what's really
exciting to me about the book i'll come

00:51:15.820 --> 00:51:15.830
exciting to me about the book i'll come
 

00:51:15.830 --> 00:51:16.990
exciting to me about the book i'll come
to the third one in a sec but what was

00:51:16.990 --> 00:51:17.000
to the third one in a sec but what was
 

00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:18.520
to the third one in a sec but what was
really exciting is that the the book

00:51:18.520 --> 00:51:18.530
really exciting is that the the book
 

00:51:18.530 --> 00:51:20.560
really exciting is that the the book
itself prescribes this litmus test about

00:51:20.560 --> 00:51:20.570
itself prescribes this litmus test about
 

00:51:20.570 --> 00:51:22.540
itself prescribes this litmus test about
how to say you know okay let's take a

00:51:22.540 --> 00:51:22.550
how to say you know okay let's take a
 

00:51:22.550 --> 00:51:24.190
how to say you know okay let's take a
step back at the number if I'm requested

00:51:24.190 --> 00:51:24.200
step back at the number if I'm requested
 

00:51:24.200 --> 00:51:26.020
step back at the number if I'm requested
to give a number if I'm looking at a

00:51:26.020 --> 00:51:26.030
to give a number if I'm looking at a
 

00:51:26.030 --> 00:51:27.490
to give a number if I'm looking at a
number let's let's stop and think about

00:51:27.490 --> 00:51:27.500
number let's let's stop and think about
 

00:51:27.500 --> 00:51:28.810
number let's let's stop and think about
what that is and if you hadn't read the

00:51:28.810 --> 00:51:28.820
what that is and if you hadn't read the
 

00:51:28.820 --> 00:51:30.070
what that is and if you hadn't read the
book I encourage you to pick it up and

00:51:30.070 --> 00:51:30.080
book I encourage you to pick it up and
 

00:51:30.080 --> 00:51:31.660
book I encourage you to pick it up and
check out the whole thing but also

00:51:31.660 --> 00:51:31.670
check out the whole thing but also
 

00:51:31.670 --> 00:51:35.650
check out the whole thing but also
specifically this question and to me

00:51:35.650 --> 00:51:35.660
specifically this question and to me
 

00:51:35.660 --> 00:51:37.450
specifically this question and to me
whenever I get a project or I talk to an

00:51:37.450 --> 00:51:37.460
whenever I get a project or I talk to an
 

00:51:37.460 --> 00:51:38.950
whenever I get a project or I talk to an
organization about their plans in terms

00:51:38.950 --> 00:51:38.960
organization about their plans in terms
 

00:51:38.960 --> 00:51:41.290
organization about their plans in terms
of evidence-based policymaking what we

00:51:41.290 --> 00:51:41.300
of evidence-based policymaking what we
 

00:51:41.300 --> 00:51:44.890
of evidence-based policymaking what we
always discuss is who's served by

00:51:44.890 --> 00:51:44.900
always discuss is who's served by
 

00:51:44.900 --> 00:51:48.490
always discuss is who's served by
collecting the number as opposed to how

00:51:48.490 --> 00:51:48.500
collecting the number as opposed to how
 

00:51:48.500 --> 00:51:50.340
collecting the number as opposed to how
do you frame your success in light of

00:51:50.340 --> 00:51:50.350
do you frame your success in light of
 

00:51:50.350 --> 00:51:52.870
do you frame your success in light of
service to your client base service to

00:51:52.870 --> 00:51:52.880
service to your client base service to
 

00:51:52.880 --> 00:51:55.180
service to your client base service to
the people that you're protecting and I

00:51:55.180 --> 00:51:55.190
the people that you're protecting and I
 

00:51:55.190 --> 00:51:58.300
the people that you're protecting and I
think that among among funders as well

00:51:58.300 --> 00:51:58.310
think that among among funders as well
 

00:51:58.310 --> 00:52:00.100
think that among among funders as well
as among policymakers we really need to

00:52:00.100 --> 00:52:00.110
as among policymakers we really need to
 

00:52:00.110 --> 00:52:02.590
as among policymakers we really need to
be able to step back and say that is the

00:52:02.590 --> 00:52:02.600
be able to step back and say that is the
 

00:52:02.600 --> 00:52:04.980
be able to step back and say that is the
true goal the true goal really is not

00:52:04.980 --> 00:52:04.990
true goal the true goal really is not
 

00:52:04.990 --> 00:52:07.450
true goal the true goal really is not
this number is large and therefore we

00:52:07.450 --> 00:52:07.460
this number is large and therefore we
 

00:52:07.460 --> 00:52:09.310
this number is large and therefore we
must pay attention which speaks to my

00:52:09.310 --> 00:52:09.320
must pay attention which speaks to my
 

00:52:09.320 --> 00:52:11.590
must pay attention which speaks to my
second point or my third point but

00:52:11.590 --> 00:52:11.600
second point or my third point but
 

00:52:11.600 --> 00:52:15.520
second point or my third point but
really what is the point of doing human

00:52:15.520 --> 00:52:15.530
really what is the point of doing human
 

00:52:15.530 --> 00:52:16.600
really what is the point of doing human
rights work if you're not actually

00:52:16.600 --> 00:52:16.610
rights work if you're not actually
 

00:52:16.610 --> 00:52:21.040
rights work if you're not actually
fulfilling a human rights issue if

00:52:21.040 --> 00:52:21.050
fulfilling a human rights issue if
 

00:52:21.050 --> 00:52:24.190
fulfilling a human rights issue if
you're not preventing or or alleviating

00:52:24.190 --> 00:52:24.200
you're not preventing or or alleviating
 

00:52:24.200 --> 00:52:27.250
you're not preventing or or alleviating
a human rights problem um and the final

00:52:27.250 --> 00:52:27.260
a human rights problem um and the final
 

00:52:27.260 --> 00:52:29.470
a human rights problem um and the final
piece here is that numbers really do

00:52:29.470 --> 00:52:29.480
piece here is that numbers really do
 

00:52:29.480 --> 00:52:32.560
piece here is that numbers really do
urge us to do something and so what we

00:52:32.560 --> 00:52:32.570
urge us to do something and so what we
 

00:52:32.570 --> 00:52:34.300

there and make sure that you continue to

00:53:04.779 --> 00:53:04.789
there and make sure that you continue to
 

00:53:04.789 --> 00:53:06.160
there and make sure that you continue to
complicate the narrative but that's

00:53:06.160 --> 00:53:06.170
complicate the narrative but that's
 

00:53:06.170 --> 00:53:08.230

rights case that we bring and so I think

00:53:23.650 --> 00:53:23.660
rights case that we bring and so I think
 

00:53:23.660 --> 00:53:26.020
rights case that we bring and so I think
that there's also this this other this

00:53:26.020 --> 00:53:26.030
that there's also this this other this
 

00:53:26.030 --> 00:53:29.079
that there's also this this other this
other interesting hazard in developing

visualization we're seeing mashup of

00:54:12.849 --> 00:54:12.859
visualization we're seeing mashup of
 

00:54:12.859 --> 00:54:15.430
visualization we're seeing mashup of
data and we're seeing the something

00:54:15.430 --> 00:54:15.440
data and we're seeing the something
 

00:54:15.440 --> 00:54:16.480
data and we're seeing the something
that's really interesting to me which is

00:54:16.480 --> 00:54:16.490
that's really interesting to me which is
 

00:54:16.490 --> 00:54:19.510
that's really interesting to me which is
this this recognition that there are

00:54:19.510 --> 00:54:19.520
this this recognition that there are
 

00:54:19.520 --> 00:54:21.130
this this recognition that there are
silos of information within different

silos of information within different
 

00:54:21.140 --> 00:54:23.950
silos of information within different
organizations and in coalition if there

00:54:23.950 --> 00:54:23.960
organizations and in coalition if there
 

00:54:23.960 --> 00:54:26.130
organizations and in coalition if there
is a neutral platform that lets people

00:54:26.130 --> 00:54:26.140
is a neutral platform that lets people
 

00:54:26.140 --> 00:54:29.079
is a neutral platform that lets people
submit information to it it's a little

00:54:29.079 --> 00:54:29.089
submit information to it it's a little
 

00:54:29.089 --> 00:54:32.920
submit information to it it's a little
more technical than that but but sharing

00:54:32.920 --> 00:54:32.930
more technical than that but but sharing
 

00:54:32.930 --> 00:54:34.690
more technical than that but but sharing
data repositories and really determining

00:54:34.690 --> 00:54:34.700
data repositories and really determining
 

00:54:34.700 --> 00:54:36.490
data repositories and really determining
what information is shareable with

00:54:36.490 --> 00:54:36.500
what information is shareable with
 

00:54:36.500 --> 00:54:39.120
what information is shareable with
respect to privacy with respect to

possibilities what we can do with that

00:54:42.700 --> 00:54:42.710
possibilities what we can do with that
 

00:54:42.710 --> 00:54:46.180
possibilities what we can do with that
information and then the last two pieces

00:54:46.180 --> 00:54:46.190
information and then the last two pieces
 

00:54:46.190 --> 00:54:48.220
information and then the last two pieces
are about sort of regrouping and

00:54:48.220 --> 00:54:48.230
are about sort of regrouping and
 

00:54:48.230 --> 00:54:49.779
are about sort of regrouping and
refocusing the storyline a little bit

00:54:49.779 --> 00:54:49.789
refocusing the storyline a little bit
 

00:54:49.789 --> 00:54:53.859
refocusing the storyline a little bit
more so this is an example of a

00:54:53.859 --> 00:54:53.869
more so this is an example of a
 

00:54:53.869 --> 00:54:55.210
more so this is an example of a

that was that's from about eight years
ago so on the

00:55:00.390 --> 00:55:00.400
ago so on the
 

00:55:00.400 --> 00:55:02.250
ago so on the

01:00:02.700 --> 01:00:02.710
maintain and produce better statistics
 

01:00:02.710 --> 01:00:05.760
maintain and produce better statistics
then you would be doing something for

01:00:05.760 --> 01:00:05.770
then you would be doing something for
 

01:00:05.770 --> 01:00:08.430
then you would be doing something for
the greater good I don't think that they

01:00:08.430 --> 01:00:08.440
the greater good I don't think that they
 

01:00:08.440 --> 01:00:10.440
the greater good I don't think that they
would want it I don't think that they

01:00:10.440 --> 01:00:10.450
would want it I don't think that they
 

01:00:10.450 --> 01:00:12.630
would want it I don't think that they
that it would have the kind of results

01:00:12.630 --> 01:00:12.640
that it would have the kind of results
 

01:00:12.640 --> 01:00:13.860
that it would have the kind of results
that we hope from the human rights

01:00:13.860 --> 01:00:13.870
that we hope from the human rights
 

01:00:13.870 --> 01:00:15.060
that we hope from the human rights
movement and I actually don't think that

01:00:15.060 --> 01:00:15.070
movement and I actually don't think that
 

01:00:15.070 --> 01:00:16.770
movement and I actually don't think that
anybody writing in the book would say

01:00:16.770 --> 01:00:16.780
anybody writing in the book would say
 

01:00:16.780 --> 01:00:17.760
anybody writing in the book would say
that that was a good thing that

01:00:17.760 --> 01:00:17.770
that that was a good thing that
 

01:00:17.770 --> 01:00:20.790

01:00:20.790 --> 01:00:20.800
diverting Human Rights attention towards
 

01:00:20.800 --> 01:00:22.500
diverting Human Rights attention towards
producing better statistics simply to

01:00:22.500 --> 01:00:22.510
producing better statistics simply to
 

01:00:22.510 --> 01:00:25.620
producing better statistics simply to
fulfill the demand for numbers would be

01:00:25.620 --> 01:00:25.630
fulfill the demand for numbers would be
 

01:00:25.630 --> 01:00:28.200
fulfill the demand for numbers would be
the right thing to do so I'm going to

01:00:28.200 --> 01:00:28.210
the right thing to do so I'm going to
 

01:00:28.210 --> 01:00:29.670
the right thing to do so I'm going to
end there I think we'll have a bunch of

heard a lot of criticism of numbers but

01:01:29.280 --> 01:01:29.290
heard a lot of criticism of numbers but
 

01:01:29.290 --> 01:01:31.980
heard a lot of criticism of numbers but
and but are there any good numbers out

01:01:31.980 --> 01:01:31.990
and but are there any good numbers out
 

01:01:31.990 --> 01:01:34.260
and but are there any good numbers out
there and if there are Wow would we know

01:01:34.260 --> 01:01:34.270
there and if there are Wow would we know
 

01:01:34.270 --> 01:01:36.980
there and if there are Wow would we know
right because if it's if it's all just a

bunch of noise how would we really know

01:01:40.020 --> 01:01:40.030
bunch of noise how would we really know
 

01:01:40.030 --> 01:01:43.440

a good number when we when we saw it you

01:01:43.440 --> 01:01:43.450
a good number when we when we saw it you
 

01:01:43.450 --> 01:01:45.030
a good number when we when we saw it you
know and I know for academics you know

01:01:45.030 --> 01:01:45.040

what's problematic for politicians is
 

01:01:49.660 --> 01:01:51.060
what's problematic for politicians is
actually usually really good for

01:01:51.060 --> 01:01:51.070
actually usually really good for

that show us different things in order
 

01:01:54.580 --> 01:01:56.310
that show us different things in order
to really refine our theories and figure

out what's going on so there's a you

01:01:59.520 --> 01:01:59.530
out what's going on so there's a you
 

01:01:59.530 --> 01:02:03.990
out what's going on so there's a you
know a cross purpose there and also if

01:02:03.990 --> 01:02:04.000
know a cross purpose there and also if
 

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:05.730
know a cross purpose there and also if
the numbers are problematic are they

01:02:05.730 --> 01:02:05.740
the numbers are problematic are they
 

01:02:05.740 --> 01:02:08.090
the numbers are problematic are they
more problematic than what came before

01:02:08.090 --> 01:02:08.100
more problematic than what came before
 

01:02:08.100 --> 01:02:09.960
more problematic than what came before
in other words if this is a new

01:02:09.960 --> 01:02:09.970
in other words if this is a new
 

01:02:09.970 --> 01:02:12.510
in other words if this is a new
phenomenon what was there before and if

01:02:12.510 --> 01:02:12.520
phenomenon what was there before and if
 

01:02:12.520 --> 01:02:14.240
phenomenon what was there before and if
what was there before were a lot of

01:02:14.240 --> 01:02:14.250
what was there before were a lot of
 

01:02:14.250 --> 01:02:16.380
what was there before were a lot of
disconnected anecdotes that we didn't

01:02:16.380 --> 01:02:16.390
disconnected anecdotes that we didn't
 

01:02:16.390 --> 01:02:18.000
disconnected anecdotes that we didn't
know how to knit together or we couldn't

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:18.010
know how to knit together or we couldn't
 

01:02:18.010 --> 01:02:20.730
know how to knit together or we couldn't
tell how representative they were you

01:02:20.730 --> 01:02:20.740
tell how representative they were you
 

01:02:20.740 --> 01:02:23.099
tell how representative they were you
know isn't that also problematic and

01:02:23.099 --> 01:02:23.109
know isn't that also problematic and
 

01:02:23.109 --> 01:02:25.920
know isn't that also problematic and
then one final really directed a

01:02:25.920 --> 01:02:25.930
then one final really directed a
 

01:02:25.930 --> 01:02:29.040
then one final really directed a
question to Lauren nettle field it was

01:02:29.040 --> 01:02:29.050
question to Lauren nettle field it was
 

01:02:29.050 --> 01:02:34.650

Bernita and the skepticism about sorry
was some as part of the story about

01:02:38.460 --> 01:02:38.470
was some as part of the story about
 

01:02:38.470 --> 01:02:40.470
was some as part of the story about
schreber neatza and the fact that you

schreber neatza and the fact that you
 

01:02:40.480 --> 01:02:42.960
schreber neatza and the fact that you
with more you reported numbers the more

01:02:42.960 --> 01:02:42.970
with more you reported numbers the more
 

01:02:42.970 --> 01:02:47.160

pushback he found was that rooted in

01:02:47.160 --> 01:02:47.170
pushback he found was that rooted in
 

01:02:47.170 --> 01:02:49.080
pushback he found was that rooted in
skepticism about the numbers themselves

01:02:49.080 --> 01:02:49.090
skepticism about the numbers themselves
 

01:02:49.090 --> 01:02:51.330
skepticism about the numbers themselves
in other words did people not believe

01:02:51.330 --> 01:02:51.340
in other words did people not believe
 

01:02:51.340 --> 01:02:52.940
in other words did people not believe
them or thought that the numbers were

01:02:52.940 --> 01:02:52.950
them or thought that the numbers were
 

01:02:52.950 --> 01:02:56.220
them or thought that the numbers were
politicized you know so in a sense

01:02:56.220 --> 01:02:56.230
politicized you know so in a sense
 

01:02:56.230 --> 01:03:00.840

critical facilities the way we were
 

01:03:02.410 --> 01:03:04.200
critical facilities the way we were
talking about but at least using the

questions I'm afraid and probably won't
 

01:03:26.220 --> 01:03:27.440
questions I'm afraid and probably won't
answer all of them but I was

01:03:27.440 --> 01:03:27.450
answer all of them but I was
 

01:03:27.450 --> 01:03:32.780
answer all of them but I was
particularly struck by your question are

01:03:32.780 --> 01:03:32.790
particularly struck by your question are
 

01:03:32.790 --> 01:03:35.440
particularly struck by your question are
all numbers bad are there good numbers

01:03:35.440 --> 01:03:35.450
all numbers bad are there good numbers
 

01:03:35.450 --> 01:03:38.450
all numbers bad are there good numbers
and I guess my reaction that was I hope

I didn't give the impression that
 

01:03:39.980 --> 01:03:43.970
I didn't give the impression that
numbers are inherently bad the idea here

01:03:43.970 --> 01:03:43.980
numbers are inherently bad the idea here
 

01:03:43.980 --> 01:03:46.910
numbers are inherently bad the idea here
in this book is that we it's just a

need more you know numeracy that's a

01:04:00.320 --> 01:04:00.330
need more you know numeracy that's a
 

01:04:00.330 --> 01:04:04.250
need more you know numeracy that's a
word and that numbers are neither good

01:04:04.250 --> 01:04:04.260
word and that numbers are neither good
 

01:04:04.260 --> 01:04:06.860
word and that numbers are neither good
or bad they are constructs they don't

01:04:06.860 --> 01:04:06.870
or bad they are constructs they don't
 

01:04:06.870 --> 01:04:11.410
or bad they are constructs they don't

exist on their own and so for example
 

01:04:11.420 --> 01:04:14.570
exist on their own and so for example
and you and this is related to your

01:04:14.570 --> 01:04:14.580
and you and this is related to your
 

01:04:14.580 --> 01:04:18.980
and you and this is related to your
question of you know are some numbers

01:04:18.980 --> 01:04:18.990
question of you know are some numbers
 

01:04:18.990 --> 01:04:20.660
question of you know are some numbers
harder than others so take the case of

01:04:20.660 --> 01:04:20.670
harder than others so take the case of
 

01:04:20.670 --> 01:04:24.020
harder than others so take the case of
drugs some numbers actually are quite

01:04:24.020 --> 01:04:24.030
drugs some numbers actually are quite
 

01:04:24.030 --> 01:04:27.950
drugs some numbers actually are quite
useful and quite hard and easily

01:04:27.950 --> 01:04:27.960
useful and quite hard and easily
 

01:04:27.960 --> 01:04:29.960
useful and quite hard and easily
measurable so for example in the drug

01:04:29.960 --> 01:04:29.970
measurable so for example in the drug
 

01:04:29.970 --> 01:04:32.870
measurable so for example in the drug
trade drug seizure statistics don't tell

01:04:32.870 --> 01:04:32.880
trade drug seizure statistics don't tell
 

01:04:32.880 --> 01:04:35.600
trade drug seizure statistics don't tell
us a whole lot in my view but price and

01:04:35.600 --> 01:04:35.610
us a whole lot in my view but price and
 

01:04:35.610 --> 01:04:38.630
us a whole lot in my view but price and
purity statistics on the street level

01:04:38.630 --> 01:04:38.640
purity statistics on the street level
 

01:04:38.640 --> 01:04:41.120
purity statistics on the street level
tell you a lot so you can you can look

01:04:41.120 --> 01:04:41.130
tell you a lot so you can you can look
 

01:04:41.130 --> 01:04:43.880
tell you a lot so you can you can look
cities across America and look at you

01:04:43.880 --> 01:04:43.890
cities across America and look at you
 

01:04:43.890 --> 01:04:45.950

know price of cocaine how it fluctuates

01:04:45.950 --> 01:04:45.960
know price of cocaine how it fluctuates
 

01:04:45.960 --> 01:04:48.670
know price of cocaine how it fluctuates
the whole idea of the war on drugs is to

01:04:48.670 --> 01:04:48.680
the whole idea of the war on drugs is to
 

01:04:48.680 --> 01:04:53.060
the whole idea of the war on drugs is to
is to basically increase prices and so

01:04:53.060 --> 01:04:53.070
is to basically increase prices and so
 

01:04:53.070 --> 01:04:56.020
is to basically increase prices and so
they have undercover bus controlled

01:04:56.020 --> 01:04:56.030
they have undercover bus controlled
 

01:04:56.030 --> 01:04:58.040
they have undercover bus controlled
sales where they then basically

01:04:58.040 --> 01:04:58.050
sales where they then basically
 

01:04:58.050 --> 01:05:01.010
sales where they then basically
undercover purchases to basically trace

01:05:01.010 --> 01:05:01.020
undercover purchases to basically trace
 

01:05:01.020 --> 01:05:03.860
undercover purchases to basically trace
over time sales and you can track it

01:05:03.860 --> 01:05:03.870
over time sales and you can track it
 

01:05:03.870 --> 01:05:05.720
over time sales and you can track it
across different drugs marijuana cocaine

across different drugs marijuana cocaine
 

01:05:05.730 --> 01:05:09.740
across different drugs marijuana cocaine
and basically by those numbers you

01:05:09.740 --> 01:05:09.750
and basically by those numbers you
 

01:05:09.750 --> 01:05:13.860
and basically by those numbers you
really see the very limited effect of a

01:05:13.860 --> 01:05:13.870
really see the very limited effect of a
 

01:05:13.870 --> 01:05:16.230
really see the very limited effect of a
of drug enforcement in terms of actually

01:05:16.230 --> 01:05:16.240
of drug enforcement in terms of actually
 

01:05:16.240 --> 01:05:19.650
of drug enforcement in terms of actually
being able to significantly raise drug

01:05:19.650 --> 01:05:19.660
being able to significantly raise drug
 

01:05:19.660 --> 01:05:21.150
being able to significantly raise drug

here is is basically public awareness

01:06:00.180 --> 01:06:00.190
here is is basically public awareness
 

01:06:00.190 --> 01:06:03.150
here is is basically public awareness

right after me it's actually the very

01:06:11.190 --> 01:06:11.200
right after me it's actually the very
 

01:06:11.200 --> 01:06:13.940
right after me it's actually the very

creation of a modern state in terms of
 

01:06:13.950 --> 01:06:17.040
creation of a modern state in terms of
statistics sort of it's actually the

01:06:17.040 --> 01:06:17.050
statistics sort of it's actually the
 

01:06:17.050 --> 01:06:18.900
statistics sort of it's actually the
word statistics it's supposed to be

01:06:18.900 --> 01:06:18.910
word statistics it's supposed to be
 

01:06:18.910 --> 01:06:21.360

there was nothing I agree these are
 

01:06:42.220 --> 01:06:44.220
there was nothing I agree these are
interesting questions and I think in a

01:06:44.220 --> 01:06:44.230
interesting questions and I think in a
 

01:06:44.230 --> 01:06:46.170
interesting questions and I think in a
way I'm sorry Sally can speak in the mic

01:06:46.170 --> 01:06:46.180
way I'm sorry Sally can speak in the mic
 

01:06:46.180 --> 01:06:50.970

sorry slightly differently than just

01:06:50.970 --> 01:06:50.980
sorry slightly differently than just
 

01:06:50.980 --> 01:06:52.770

about generating numbers because I'm

01:06:52.770 --> 01:06:52.780
about generating numbers because I'm
 

01:06:52.780 --> 01:06:54.680
about generating numbers because I'm
interested in the kind of second-tier

01:06:54.680 --> 01:06:54.690
interested in the kind of second-tier
 

01:06:54.690 --> 01:06:56.850
interested in the kind of second-tier
process which is you take the numbers

01:06:56.850 --> 01:06:56.860
process which is you take the numbers
 

01:06:56.860 --> 01:06:59.340
process which is you take the numbers
and you construct them into some sorts

01:06:59.340 --> 01:06:59.350
and you construct them into some sorts
 

01:06:59.350 --> 01:07:01.830
and you construct them into some sorts
of measurement device is the indicator

01:07:01.830 --> 01:07:01.840
of measurement device is the indicator
 

01:07:01.840 --> 01:07:04.530
of measurement device is the indicator
the so it's not just the raw number but

01:07:04.530 --> 01:07:04.540
the so it's not just the raw number but
 

01:07:04.540 --> 01:07:06.990
the so it's not just the raw number but
the ranking the series system and what

01:07:06.990 --> 01:07:07.000
the ranking the series system and what
 

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:11.490
the ranking the series system and what
that process looks like I began looking

01:07:11.490 --> 01:07:11.500
that process looks like I began looking
 

01:07:11.500 --> 01:07:13.710
that process looks like I began looking
at these with a lot of skepticism this

01:07:13.710 --> 01:07:13.720
at these with a lot of skepticism this
 

01:07:13.720 --> 01:07:15.480
at these with a lot of skepticism this
kind of knowledge is very different from

01:07:15.480 --> 01:07:15.490
kind of knowledge is very different from
 

01:07:15.490 --> 01:07:17.190
kind of knowledge is very different from
the sorts of qualitative narrative

01:07:17.190 --> 01:07:17.200
the sorts of qualitative narrative
 

01:07:17.200 --> 01:07:19.140
the sorts of qualitative narrative
knowledge that I think provides the

01:07:19.140 --> 01:07:19.150
knowledge that I think provides the
 

01:07:19.150 --> 01:07:22.230
knowledge that I think provides the
context and the framing that is much

01:07:22.230 --> 01:07:22.240
context and the framing that is much

better way of understanding things but i

01:07:24.750 --> 01:07:24.760

have come to

01:07:26.010 --> 01:07:26.020
have come to
 

01:07:26.020 --> 01:07:28.260
have come to
see that this is all so fundamental to

see that this is all so fundamental to
 

01:07:28.270 --> 01:07:30.660
see that this is all so fundamental to
reform movements and so if I can be an

01:07:32.130 --> 01:07:32.140
anthropologist for a moment it's kind of
 

01:07:32.140 --> 01:07:34.230

which can be used for good or for evil
 

01:07:36.040 --> 01:07:38.580

depending on how you they get used I

01:07:38.580 --> 01:07:38.590
depending on how you they get used I
 

01:07:38.590 --> 01:07:40.260
depending on how you they get used I
think it's important to recognize that

01:07:40.260 --> 01:07:40.270
think it's important to recognize that
 

01:07:40.270 --> 01:07:42.690
think it's important to recognize that
some things are much more measurable

01:07:42.690 --> 01:07:42.700
some things are much more measurable
 

01:07:42.700 --> 01:07:45.390
some things are much more measurable
than others so you could count things

01:07:45.390 --> 01:07:45.400
than others so you could count things
 

01:07:45.400 --> 01:07:47.010
than others so you could count things
like the number of people that show up

01:07:47.010 --> 01:07:47.020

just one example I've have watched NGOs
try to build issues and the first thing

01:08:23.099 --> 01:08:23.109
try to build issues and the first thing
 

01:08:23.109 --> 01:08:25.590
try to build issues and the first thing
they do is to count right to build your

01:08:25.590 --> 01:08:25.600
they do is to count right to build your
 

01:08:25.600 --> 01:08:27.240

01:08:27.240 --> 01:08:27.250
issue you have to show how big it is how
 

01:08:27.250 --> 01:08:29.910
issue you have to show how big it is how
important it is so I you know the

01:08:29.910 --> 01:08:29.920
important it is so I you know the
 

01:08:29.920 --> 01:08:31.950

question is what did we do before and it

01:08:38.760 --> 01:08:38.770
question is what did we do before and it
 

01:08:38.770 --> 01:08:41.670
question is what did we do before and it
may be that we had small cadres of

01:08:41.670 --> 01:08:41.680
may be that we had small cadres of

decisions and one of the arguments for
 

01:08:45.970 --> 01:08:48.240
decisions and one of the arguments for
these use of indicators and numbers is

01:08:48.240 --> 01:08:48.250
these use of indicators and numbers is
 

01:08:48.250 --> 01:08:51.090
these use of indicators and numbers is
that increases Democratic openness makes

that can happen as well in certain

what kind of knowledge is being produced

what kind of knowledge is being produced
but there is always this possibility of

but there is always this possibility of
 

01:09:08.290 --> 01:09:11.430
but there is always this possibility of
greater public scrutiny when things are

01:09:11.430 --> 01:09:11.440
greater public scrutiny when things are
 

01:09:11.440 --> 01:09:15.000
greater public scrutiny when things are
known through this mechanism I think

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:15.010
known through this mechanism I think
 

01:09:15.010 --> 01:09:19.289
known through this mechanism I think
that the problem is kind of both sorry

bad numbers and numbers themselves you

01:09:23.370 --> 01:09:23.380
bad numbers and numbers themselves you
 

01:09:23.380 --> 01:09:24.329
bad numbers and numbers themselves you
know I think I said in my presentation

01:09:24.329 --> 01:09:24.339

pretty repetitively that I want the

01:09:29.380 --> 01:09:33.360
conversation to move away from numbers
but I do i do think that when we talk

01:09:33.360 --> 01:09:33.370
but I do i do think that when we talk

about patterns over time an organization

01:09:36.990 --> 01:09:37.000
about patterns over time an organization
 

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:38.370
about patterns over time an organization
can really think about those patterns

01:09:38.370 --> 01:09:38.380
can really think about those patterns
 

01:09:38.380 --> 01:09:38.849
can really think about those patterns
over

01:09:38.849 --> 01:09:38.859

clients get scanned and scraped and they

01:09:46.200 --> 01:09:46.210
clients get scanned and scraped and they
 

01:09:46.210 --> 01:09:47.399
clients get scanned and scraped and they
can deal with it and that they could

01:09:47.399 --> 01:09:47.409
can deal with it and that they could
 

01:09:47.409 --> 01:09:49.019
can deal with it and that they could
make statements about the data that they

01:09:49.019 --> 01:09:49.029
make statements about the data that they
 

01:09:49.029 --> 01:09:51.359
make statements about the data that they
have and I think that that may be

01:09:51.359 --> 01:09:51.369
have and I think that that may be
 

01:09:51.369 --> 01:09:53.910
have and I think that that may be
helpful to them it's kind of a larger

01:09:53.910 --> 01:09:53.920
helpful to them it's kind of a larger
 

01:09:53.920 --> 01:09:56.250
helpful to them it's kind of a larger

we're providing legal aid for these
 

01:10:03.730 --> 01:10:05.700
we're providing legal aid for these
problems because we think they're the

problems because we think they're the
 

01:10:05.710 --> 01:10:07.740

worst if the organization can look and

01:10:07.740 --> 01:10:07.750
worst if the organization can look and

should really take a look at those so

01:11:56.869 --> 01:11:56.879
to rank countries or at least to be able
 

01:11:56.879 --> 01:11:58.250
to rank countries or at least to be able
to compare across countries you know

01:11:58.250 --> 01:11:58.260
to compare across countries you know
 

01:11:58.260 --> 01:11:59.989
to compare across countries you know
we've got a finite amount of resources

01:11:59.989 --> 01:11:59.999
we've got a finite amount of resources
 

01:11:59.999 --> 01:12:02.209
we've got a finite amount of resources
that have to be allocated across

01:12:02.209 --> 01:12:02.219
that have to be allocated across
 

01:12:02.219 --> 01:12:04.099
that have to be allocated across
countries and you have to set priorities

01:12:04.099 --> 01:12:04.109
countries and you have to set priorities
 

01:12:04.109 --> 01:12:06.770
countries and you have to set priorities
so and i would think that in some of the

01:12:06.770 --> 01:12:06.780
so and i would think that in some of the
 

01:12:06.780 --> 01:12:08.389
so and i would think that in some of the
human rights contexts you need to do

01:12:08.389 --> 01:12:08.399
human rights contexts you need to do
 

01:12:08.399 --> 01:12:10.009
human rights contexts you need to do
that as well you know set priorities

01:12:10.009 --> 01:12:10.019
that as well you know set priorities
 

01:12:10.019 --> 01:12:11.299
that as well you know set priorities
across countries at least some

01:12:11.299 --> 01:12:11.309
across countries at least some
 

01:12:11.309 --> 01:12:13.699
across countries at least some
organizations have to do that including

01:12:13.699 --> 01:12:13.709
organizations have to do that including
 

01:12:13.709 --> 01:12:15.049
organizations have to do that including
maybe the open society so i was just

01:12:15.049 --> 01:12:15.059
maybe the open society so i was just
 

01:12:15.059 --> 01:12:18.290
maybe the open society so i was just
wondering if you use numbers rankings so

01:12:18.290 --> 01:12:18.300
wondering if you use numbers rankings so
 

01:12:18.300 --> 01:12:21.049
wondering if you use numbers rankings so
or something for for that purpose in

01:12:21.049 --> 01:12:21.059
or something for for that purpose in
 

01:12:21.059 --> 01:12:23.029
or something for for that purpose in
your own work right growth let's take a

01:12:23.029 --> 01:12:23.039
your own work right growth let's take a
 

01:12:23.039 --> 01:12:24.439
your own work right growth let's take a
couple more and bundle them into

01:12:24.439 --> 01:12:24.449
couple more and bundle them into
 

01:12:24.449 --> 01:12:29.029
couple more and bundle them into
responses yeah Louise hi at least

Sally Mary or anyone really since you
 

01:12:35.129 --> 01:12:37.509
Sally Mary or anyone really since you
talked about the possible beneficial

01:12:37.509 --> 01:12:37.519
talked about the possible beneficial
 

01:12:37.519 --> 01:12:41.479
talked about the possible beneficial
uses of rankings but we haven't heard

01:12:41.479 --> 01:12:41.489
uses of rankings but we haven't heard
 

01:12:41.489 --> 01:12:42.889

too much specifically about that tonight

01:12:42.889 --> 01:12:42.899
too much specifically about that tonight
 

01:12:42.899 --> 01:12:46.369
too much specifically about that tonight
earlier in the semester when someone was

01:12:46.369 --> 01:12:46.379
earlier in the semester when someone was
 

01:12:46.379 --> 01:12:49.579
earlier in the semester when someone was
here from Freedom House she spoke about

01:12:49.579 --> 01:12:49.589
here from Freedom House she spoke about
 

01:12:49.589 --> 01:12:52.669
here from Freedom House she spoke about
how sometimes representatives from

01:12:52.669 --> 01:12:52.679
how sometimes representatives from
 

01:12:52.679 --> 01:12:54.079
how sometimes representatives from
different countries call her on the

01:12:54.079 --> 01:12:54.089
different countries call her on the
 

01:12:54.089 --> 01:12:58.129
different countries call her on the
phone to lobby for higher boosting the

01:13:00.239 --> 01:13:02.299

but I think that it's important to think
 

01:17:24.630 --> 01:17:26.720
but I think that it's important to think
about well why do you need the numbers

point is that the counters should not

need a narrative to hold the numbers

01:19:31.669 --> 01:19:31.679
need a narrative to hold the numbers
 

01:19:31.679 --> 01:19:33.890
need a narrative to hold the numbers
together so that the numbers a narrative

01:19:33.890 --> 01:19:33.900
together so that the numbers a narrative
 

01:19:33.900 --> 01:19:36.410

they are very resistant to being ranking
 

01:20:46.390 --> 01:20:48.240
they are very resistant to being ranking
they presented this idea to the human

01:20:48.240 --> 01:20:48.250
they presented this idea to the human
 

01:20:48.250 --> 01:20:50.340
they presented this idea to the human
rights committee that monitors the iccpr

01:20:50.340 --> 01:20:50.350
rights committee that monitors the iccpr
 

01:20:50.350 --> 01:20:52.590
rights committee that monitors the iccpr
and they got substantial push back

01:20:52.590 --> 01:20:52.600
and they got substantial push back
 

01:20:52.600 --> 01:20:55.850
and they got substantial push back
saying we don't want countries ranked so

01:20:55.850 --> 01:20:55.860
saying we don't want countries ranked so
 

01:20:55.860 --> 01:20:58.200
saying we don't want countries ranked so
that suggests that it might be powerful

01:20:58.200 --> 01:20:58.210
that suggests that it might be powerful
 

01:20:58.210 --> 01:21:00.150
that suggests that it might be powerful
actually to rank countries by human

01:21:00.150 --> 01:21:00.160
actually to rank countries by human
 

01:21:00.160 --> 01:21:02.220
actually to rank countries by human
rights but it may also be too

01:21:02.220 --> 01:21:02.230
rights but it may also be too
 

01:21:02.230 --> 01:21:05.070
rights but it may also be too
politically difficult but it is an area

01:21:05.070 --> 01:21:05.080
politically difficult but it is an area
 

01:21:05.080 --> 01:21:07.350
politically difficult but it is an area
that it might it might happen I think

01:21:07.350 --> 01:21:07.360
that it might it might happen I think
 

01:21:07.360 --> 01:21:09.000
that it might it might happen I think
the human rights community has a self

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:09.010
the human rights community has a self
 

01:21:09.010 --> 01:21:12.750
the human rights community has a self
resisted this i would say that numbers

01:21:12.750 --> 01:21:12.760
resisted this i would say that numbers
 

01:21:12.760 --> 01:21:15.180
resisted this i would say that numbers
do produce theory but as I tried to show

01:21:15.180 --> 01:21:15.190
do produce theory but as I tried to show
 

01:21:15.190 --> 01:21:17.730
do produce theory but as I tried to show
in my brief talk the choice of numbers

01:21:17.730 --> 01:21:17.740
in my brief talk the choice of numbers
 

01:21:17.740 --> 01:21:20.670
in my brief talk the choice of numbers
is in fact derived from theory so your

01:21:20.670 --> 01:21:20.680
is in fact derived from theory so your
 

01:21:20.680 --> 01:21:22.890
is in fact derived from theory so your
theory shapes the way you pick numbers

01:21:22.890 --> 01:21:22.900
theory shapes the way you pick numbers
 

01:21:22.900 --> 01:21:24.540
theory shapes the way you pick numbers
and what you choose to measure so it's

01:21:24.540 --> 01:21:24.550
and what you choose to measure so it's
 

01:21:24.550 --> 01:21:26.430
and what you choose to measure so it's
not like there's a you know as I'm sure

01:21:26.430 --> 01:21:26.440
not like there's a you know as I'm sure
 

01:21:26.440 --> 01:21:28.380
not like there's a you know as I'm sure
you know a space where you could do the

01:21:28.380 --> 01:21:28.390
you know a space where you could do the
 

01:21:28.390 --> 01:21:31.110
you know a space where you could do the
numbers then build theory I think for

01:21:31.110 --> 01:21:31.120
numbers then build theory I think for
 

01:21:31.120 --> 01:21:33.150
numbers then build theory I think for
social movements you clearly need both

01:21:33.150 --> 01:21:33.160
social movements you clearly need both
 

01:21:33.160 --> 01:21:35.250
social movements you clearly need both
numbers and stories and that the image

01:21:35.250 --> 01:21:35.260
numbers and stories and that the image
 

01:21:35.260 --> 01:21:37.530
numbers and stories and that the image
of some child and the tenement was very

01:21:37.530 --> 01:21:37.540
of some child and the tenement was very
 

01:21:37.540 --> 01:21:39.270
of some child and the tenement was very
important and getting tenements cleaned

01:21:39.270 --> 01:21:39.280
important and getting tenements cleaned
 

01:21:39.280 --> 01:21:42.330
important and getting tenements cleaned
up and we see this all the time but I

01:21:42.330 --> 01:21:42.340
up and we see this all the time but I
 

01:21:42.340 --> 01:21:44.310
up and we see this all the time but I
guess my last point I think is that I

01:21:44.310 --> 01:21:44.320
guess my last point I think is that I
 

01:21:44.320 --> 01:21:45.990
guess my last point I think is that I
think is important to differentiate the

01:21:45.990 --> 01:21:46.000
think is important to differentiate the
 

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:47.910
think is important to differentiate the
use of numbers and quantification for

01:21:47.910 --> 01:21:47.920
use of numbers and quantification for
 

01:21:47.920 --> 01:21:50.790
use of numbers and quantification for
research and for governance and I've

01:21:50.790 --> 01:21:50.800
research and for governance and I've
 

01:21:50.800 --> 01:21:52.050
research and for governance and I've
really been looking at this in the

01:21:52.050 --> 01:21:52.060
really been looking at this in the
 

01:21:52.060 --> 01:21:54.780
really been looking at this in the
governance area I think from research it

01:21:54.780 --> 01:21:54.790
governance area I think from research it
 

01:21:54.790 --> 01:21:56.700
governance area I think from research it
clearly is different these are not

01:21:56.700 --> 01:21:56.710
clearly is different these are not
 

01:21:56.710 --> 01:21:58.880
clearly is different these are not
actually distinct domains

01:21:58.880 --> 01:21:58.890
actually distinct domains
 

01:21:58.890 --> 01:22:01.190
actually distinct domains
made this distinction because academic

01:22:01.190 --> 01:22:01.200
made this distinction because academic
 

01:22:01.200 --> 01:22:04.970
made this distinction because academic
research can fold into a lot of

01:22:04.970 --> 01:22:04.980
research can fold into a lot of
 

01:22:04.980 --> 01:22:07.460
research can fold into a lot of
governance policy stuff academic

01:22:07.460 --> 01:22:07.470
governance policy stuff academic
 

01:22:07.470 --> 01:22:09.620
governance policy stuff academic
research turn serves to legitimate

01:22:09.620 --> 01:22:09.630
research turn serves to legitimate
 

01:22:09.630 --> 01:22:14.210
research turn serves to legitimate
policy numbers some policy numbers that

01:22:14.210 --> 01:22:14.220
policy numbers some policy numbers that
 

01:22:14.220 --> 01:22:15.980
policy numbers some policy numbers that
don't have academic background have less

01:22:15.980 --> 01:22:15.990
don't have academic background have less
 

01:22:15.990 --> 01:22:18.800
don't have academic background have less
credibility so they overlap but I think

01:22:18.800 --> 01:22:18.810
credibility so they overlap but I think
 

01:22:18.810 --> 01:22:21.020
credibility so they overlap but I think
in their intention at least they can be

01:22:21.020 --> 01:22:21.030
in their intention at least they can be
 

01:22:21.030 --> 01:22:23.870
in their intention at least they can be
separated and you know I could go on

01:22:23.870 --> 01:22:23.880
separated and you know I could go on
 

01:22:23.880 --> 01:22:26.000
separated and you know I could go on
about how you need qualitative data to

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:26.010
about how you need qualitative data to
 

01:22:26.010 --> 01:22:28.190
about how you need qualitative data to
interpret the meaning of quantitative

01:22:28.190 --> 01:22:28.200
interpret the meaning of quantitative
 

01:22:28.200 --> 01:22:29.900
interpret the meaning of quantitative
information but i'm sure you all know

01:22:29.900 --> 01:22:29.910
information but i'm sure you all know
 

01:22:29.910 --> 01:22:32.000
information but i'm sure you all know
that why for example in a study and

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:32.010
that why for example in a study and
 

01:22:32.010 --> 01:22:34.160
that why for example in a study and
looked at do fifty percent of the women

01:22:34.160 --> 01:22:34.170
looked at do fifty percent of the women
 

01:22:34.170 --> 01:22:35.960
looked at do fifty percent of the women
in mozambique who've been battered go to

01:22:35.960 --> 01:22:35.970
in mozambique who've been battered go to
 

01:22:35.970 --> 01:22:38.990
in mozambique who've been battered go to
helping systems and in another country

01:22:38.990 --> 01:22:39.000
helping systems and in another country
 

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:40.910
helping systems and in another country
an industrialized country i think it was

01:22:40.910 --> 01:22:40.920
an industrialized country i think it was
 

01:22:40.920 --> 01:22:42.350
an industrialized country i think it was
about ten percent you know you look at

01:22:42.350 --> 01:22:42.360
about ten percent you know you look at
 

01:22:42.360 --> 01:22:44.150
about ten percent you know you look at
these figures you say i need more than

01:22:44.150 --> 01:22:44.160
these figures you say i need more than
 

01:22:44.160 --> 01:22:46.070
these figures you say i need more than
statistics to make sense of this thing

01:22:46.070 --> 01:22:46.080
statistics to make sense of this thing
 

01:22:46.080 --> 01:22:48.530
statistics to make sense of this thing
that looks sort of counterintuitive yeah

01:22:48.530 --> 01:22:48.540
that looks sort of counterintuitive yeah
 

01:22:48.540 --> 01:22:51.470
that looks sort of counterintuitive yeah
listen i want to sort of wrap all the

01:22:51.470 --> 01:22:51.480
listen i want to sort of wrap all the
 

01:22:51.480 --> 01:22:53.810
listen i want to sort of wrap all the
questions into a big pile and i think

01:22:53.810 --> 01:22:53.820
questions into a big pile and i think
 

01:22:53.820 --> 01:22:55.220
questions into a big pile and i think
that there's two pieces of discussions

01:22:55.220 --> 01:22:55.230
that there's two pieces of discussions
 

01:22:55.230 --> 01:22:56.600
that there's two pieces of discussions
that we have going on right now one is

01:22:56.600 --> 01:22:56.610
that we have going on right now one is
 

01:22:56.610 --> 01:23:00.140
that we have going on right now one is
about disbursement of resources and what

01:23:00.140 --> 01:23:00.150
about disbursement of resources and what
 

01:23:00.150 --> 01:23:02.480
about disbursement of resources and what
what how do you choose to disperse

01:23:02.480 --> 01:23:02.490
what how do you choose to disperse
 

01:23:02.490 --> 01:23:03.830
what how do you choose to disperse
resources and i think that that's an

01:23:03.830 --> 01:23:03.840
resources and i think that that's an
 

01:23:03.840 --> 01:23:05.450
resources and i think that that's an
underlying question for why why

01:23:05.450 --> 01:23:05.460
underlying question for why why
 

01:23:05.460 --> 01:23:07.790
underlying question for why why
indicators exist at all or why we

01:23:07.790 --> 01:23:07.800
indicators exist at all or why we
 

01:23:07.800 --> 01:23:09.230
indicators exist at all or why we
collect these types of statistics or why

01:23:09.230 --> 01:23:09.240
collect these types of statistics or why
 

01:23:09.240 --> 01:23:11.600
collect these types of statistics or why
we measure numbers and fight over how

01:23:11.600 --> 01:23:11.610
we measure numbers and fight over how
 

01:23:11.610 --> 01:23:13.370
we measure numbers and fight over how
big they are and then i think that

01:23:13.370 --> 01:23:13.380
big they are and then i think that
 

01:23:13.380 --> 01:23:14.720
big they are and then i think that
there's also this other question of

01:23:14.720 --> 01:23:14.730
there's also this other question of
 

01:23:14.730 --> 01:23:16.010
there's also this other question of
measurement and evaluation how do you

01:23:16.010 --> 01:23:16.020
measurement and evaluation how do you
 

01:23:16.020 --> 01:23:19.730
measurement and evaluation how do you
evaluate the success and you know it's

01:23:19.730 --> 01:23:19.740
evaluate the success and you know it's
 

01:23:19.740 --> 01:23:22.250
evaluate the success and you know it's
kind of a it's kind of a cheap shot but

01:23:22.250 --> 01:23:22.260
kind of a it's kind of a cheap shot but
 

01:23:22.260 --> 01:23:24.050
kind of a it's kind of a cheap shot but
i want to move back to this idea of what

01:23:24.050 --> 01:23:24.060
i want to move back to this idea of what
 

01:23:24.060 --> 01:23:26.180
i want to move back to this idea of what
is the human rights movement for the

01:23:26.180 --> 01:23:26.190
is the human rights movement for the
 

01:23:26.190 --> 01:23:28.340
is the human rights movement for the
human rights movement says that one

01:23:28.340 --> 01:23:28.350
human rights movement says that one
 

01:23:28.350 --> 01:23:31.280
human rights movement says that one
instance of torture is too much and so

01:23:31.280 --> 01:23:31.290
instance of torture is too much and so
 

01:23:31.290 --> 01:23:34.100
instance of torture is too much and so
we've counted one we should kind of be

01:23:34.100 --> 01:23:34.110
we've counted one we should kind of be
 

01:23:34.110 --> 01:23:35.660
we've counted one we should kind of be
done counting for a little bit while we

01:23:35.660 --> 01:23:35.670
done counting for a little bit while we
 

01:23:35.670 --> 01:23:37.630
done counting for a little bit while we
deal with the problem and we deal with

01:23:37.630 --> 01:23:37.640
deal with the problem and we deal with
 

01:23:37.640 --> 01:23:39.860
deal with the problem and we deal with
determining what it is that we can do do

01:23:39.860 --> 01:23:39.870
determining what it is that we can do do
 

01:23:39.870 --> 01:23:41.330
determining what it is that we can do do
we need to take a litigation case do we

01:23:41.330 --> 01:23:41.340
we need to take a litigation case do we
 

01:23:41.340 --> 01:23:43.130
we need to take a litigation case do we
need to see if there are other victims

01:23:43.130 --> 01:23:43.140
need to see if there are other victims
 

01:23:43.140 --> 01:23:45.830
need to see if there are other victims
that he knows do we need to uncover how

01:23:45.830 --> 01:23:45.840
that he knows do we need to uncover how
 

01:23:45.840 --> 01:23:48.020
that he knows do we need to uncover how
we're going to prosecute a case that's

01:23:48.020 --> 01:23:48.030
we're going to prosecute a case that's
 

01:23:48.030 --> 01:23:49.790
we're going to prosecute a case that's
largely taking place in unmeasurable

01:23:49.790 --> 01:23:49.800
largely taking place in unmeasurable
 

01:23:49.800 --> 01:23:51.470
largely taking place in unmeasurable
much like much of the book and

01:23:51.470 --> 01:23:51.480
much like much of the book and
 

01:23:51.480 --> 01:23:53.780
much like much of the book and
unmeasurable instances like sort of you

01:23:53.780 --> 01:23:53.790
unmeasurable instances like sort of you
 

01:23:53.790 --> 01:23:55.460
unmeasurable instances like sort of you
pull up a rock and you're seeing a lot

01:23:55.460 --> 01:23:55.470
pull up a rock and you're seeing a lot
 

01:23:55.470 --> 01:23:59.690
pull up a rock and you're seeing a lot
of different unmeasurable things I don't

01:23:59.690 --> 01:23:59.700
of different unmeasurable things I don't
 

01:23:59.700 --> 01:24:01.850
of different unmeasurable things I don't
really think that indicators in the end

01:24:01.850 --> 01:24:01.860
really think that indicators in the end
 

01:24:01.860 --> 01:24:04.990
really think that indicators in the end
are the only reason that funding or or

01:24:04.990 --> 01:24:05.000
are the only reason that funding or or
 

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:08.180
are the only reason that funding or or
government or otherwise gets dispersed I

01:24:08.180 --> 01:24:08.190
government or otherwise gets dispersed I
 

01:24:08.190 --> 01:24:10.520
government or otherwise gets dispersed I
would be really surprised i think that

01:24:10.520 --> 01:24:10.530
would be really surprised i think that
 

01:24:10.530 --> 01:24:12.770
would be really surprised i think that
there's a complicated valuation

01:24:12.770 --> 01:24:12.780
there's a complicated valuation
 

01:24:12.780 --> 01:24:16.100
there's a complicated valuation
why we do what we do in terms of what

01:24:16.100 --> 01:24:16.110
why we do what we do in terms of what
 

01:24:16.110 --> 01:24:17.629
why we do what we do in terms of what
our government puts out with our own tax

01:24:17.629 --> 01:24:17.639
our government puts out with our own tax
 

01:24:17.639 --> 01:24:20.299
our government puts out with our own tax
money for example and it's much more

01:24:20.299 --> 01:24:20.309
money for example and it's much more
 

01:24:20.309 --> 01:24:22.189
money for example and it's much more
complicated than this game of indicators

01:24:22.189 --> 01:24:22.199
complicated than this game of indicators
 

01:24:22.199 --> 01:24:25.310
complicated than this game of indicators
in this game of ranking and then I just

01:24:25.310 --> 01:24:25.320
in this game of ranking and then I just
 

01:24:25.320 --> 01:24:27.260
in this game of ranking and then I just
want to go back to two more things one

01:24:27.260 --> 01:24:27.270
want to go back to two more things one
 

01:24:27.270 --> 01:24:28.609

of the projects I don't actually have a

01:24:28.609 --> 01:24:28.619
of the projects I don't actually have a
 

01:24:28.619 --> 01:24:32.180
of the projects I don't actually have a
body of conducted project projects to

01:24:32.180 --> 01:24:32.190
body of conducted project projects to
 

01:24:32.190 --> 01:24:33.859
body of conducted project projects to
really talk about my projects only a

01:24:33.859 --> 01:24:33.869
really talk about my projects only a
 

01:24:33.869 --> 01:24:36.470
really talk about my projects only a
year and half old so I think once we've

01:24:36.470 --> 01:24:36.480
year and half old so I think once we've
 

01:24:36.480 --> 01:24:39.049
year and half old so I think once we've
started making this a piece of what we

01:24:39.049 --> 01:24:39.059
started making this a piece of what we
 

01:24:39.059 --> 01:24:41.149
started making this a piece of what we
do we'll start to see some results a

01:24:41.149 --> 01:24:41.159
do we'll start to see some results a
 

01:24:41.159 --> 01:24:44.120
do we'll start to see some results a
year from now maybe but there's two

01:24:44.120 --> 01:24:44.130
year from now maybe but there's two
 

01:24:44.130 --> 01:24:45.529
year from now maybe but there's two
pieces that I'm excited about one is

01:24:45.529 --> 01:24:45.539
pieces that I'm excited about one is
 

01:24:45.539 --> 01:24:48.740
pieces that I'm excited about one is
this idea of creating a space within the

this idea of creating a space within the
 

01:24:48.750 --> 01:24:49.819
