00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:06.140
In 1943 we see the tide really turns in favor of the allies

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:09.700
especially in Europe but it's actually happening in the Pacific as well

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:14.240
to begin with in 1943 the siege of Stalingrad

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:16.500
which doesn't quite exactly fit on this map

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.420
but would be right over here

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:22.600
it ends with the soviets being notorious

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.760
and this is actually an incredible story

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:28.840
there's many movies about the siege of Stalingrad for a reason

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:34.080
the soviets are able to mount a pretty epic counterattack

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:36.960
by attacking the flanks of the axis army

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.920
and their able to push the back and defeat the axis army

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:41.840
Stalingrad itself gets reduced to rubble

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:43.840
and you know if you actually look up pictures of it

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:48.080
its kind of mind blowing to just even imagine what went on there

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:50.080
and Stalingrad right over here

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:53.640
although right now Leningrad in 1943 still under siege

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.640
and if you want your stomach to really be sick

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:59.000
look up images of things that happened over there

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.040
but needless to say 1943 its a turning...

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:04.360
or its not the turning point '42 really is the turning point

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.560
but in 1943, the momentum's really in the allies

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.320
favor the Soviets defeat the Germans at Stalingrad

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:15.640
they are able to push the Germans and the axis powers out of the caucases

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:18.080
and then they'd begin to advance

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:24.720
and then the Soviets begin to advance and retake ground from the axis powers

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.000
now at the same time you might remember

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.280
that at the end of 1942 in North Africa

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.560
in North Africa, let me go right over here

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.400
I have all these maps layered over here

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.560
you might remember that the British were able to

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.640
push back the axis army back into Lybia

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:50.360
and then this just continues as we go into 1943

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:57.160
and the allied armies essentially able to kick the axis army out of North Africa

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:58.600
be victorious of North Africa

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.960
you remember you have these the armies that are coming from Egypt

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:07.560
you also had allies land in Morocco and Algeria

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.560
and then they all meet up

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:14.920
and by mid-year they're able to use their victory in North Africa

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:18.440
as a launching point to start attacking the main land of Italy

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.720
they first, they can go to Sicily

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:25.640
or then they go to the actual main land, and there's an attack at Selerno

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:31.360
and they start to really kind of fight their way up the Italian peninsula

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.000
we're gonna do this in a blue color so you can see

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:40.160
this is the allies, as were going to mid- and late- 1943

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:45.520
are able to take more and more of the Italian peninula

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:49.440
now as this happens, conditions i Italy aren't good

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:50.800
the Italian people aren't happy

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:54.080
and they're actually able to depose Mussolini

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:56.080
so let me write that down

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:06.480
so this is, In 1943 Mussolini, oh i think there's another s, Mussolini is deposed

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:12.400
Mussolini is, Mussolini is deposed

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.900
and as we get later that year, Italy formally surrenders to the allies

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:21.280
now with that said, Italy has surrendered but the entire country of Italy

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.920
the entire peninsula, there's still axis troops there

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:28.160
so the allies have to continue  to slog through 1943 and 1944

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:35.420
and even to 1945 to completely rid Italy of the axis powers, and especially the Germans

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:39.420
now Rome especially is fairly hard bombing campaigns start in Rome

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:42.140
in order to completely get the axis powers out of there

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:47.940
and that all is completely happening in 19- this is all happening in 1943

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:50.920
now other, other things of note

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:52.920
and there's many things that are happening in Europe

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:55.220
and once again these are just over view videos

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:58.840
that are happening in 1943 is American forces

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:05.880
early in 1943 are able to start doing bombing attacks on Germany itself

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:10.520
and these bombing attacks only become more and more fierce as the war progresses

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:12.520
another battle of note, In mid-1943 is the battle of kursk

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:23.700
and this is really the last offensive that the axis powers are able to mount on the Eastern Front

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:26.560
and they are defeated in this battle by the soviets

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:31.740
and then once again that allows the Soviets to start going on the offensive

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:34.360
so when you look at things from a European point of view

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:39.240
the allies are definitely, they have the bulk over the momentum now

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:42.900
they're now kind of putting the squeeze on the axis powers

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:46.320
and frankly the same thing is happening in the Pacific

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:49.320
especially the Americans, they are now on the offensive

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:52.940
they're able to get closer and closer and closer to Japan
