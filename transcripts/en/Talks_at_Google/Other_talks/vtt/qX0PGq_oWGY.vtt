CHRIS DEFAY: Welcome,
everyone.

00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:05.070
My name is Chris DeFay, I am a
member of the Talks at Google

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:07.390
team here at Google
Los Angeles.

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:10.575
And we're very pleased to have
everyone here in the audience.

00:00:10.575 --> 00:00:14.590
And if you're watching on
YouTube, welcome also.

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:17.030
I'm pleased to introduce
Peter Zuckerman today.

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:20.130
He's a journalist and nonfiction
writer who joins us

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.930
to talk about his book, "Buried
in the Sky." He's

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:25.370
written an incredibly engaging
book about one of the most

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:31.280
dramatic disasters in alpine
history, a 2008 climb of K2.

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:33.680
Zuckerman interviewed the
Sherpas, survivors, and others

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:37.320
to capture what happened and
to tell this amazing story

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.340
from a fresh perspective.

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:41.570
Please join me in welcoming
Peter Zuckerman.

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.820
PETER ZUCKERMAN: Can
you hear me OK?

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.500
Thanks for having me.

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.380
I bet you there are not
many books that in the

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:59.320
acknowledgements actually
thank Google Documents.

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:02.190
This entire book was written
in Google Docs.

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:07.090
I have a collaborator, a
co-author, who lives in Spain.

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:11.090
And this book sincerely would
have been possible without

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:12.300
Google Documents.

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:14.785
So thank you if you're
one of the people who

00:01:14.785 --> 00:01:17.900
helped create that.

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:22.240
This project had started
three years ago.

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.070
I had a comfortable job at the
"Oregonian," which is the

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:28.300
largest newspaper in the
Pacific Northwest.

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:31.770
And I got a call from
my cousin and

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.200
she was really upset.

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.540
She called me and she told me
her really good friend had

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.710
just died in this mountaineering
disaster.

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:42.730
And she said, Peter, we have
to find out what happened.

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:45.890
And I've got this great idea.

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:50.690
You'll go, you'll fly to
Pakistan, you'll fly to Nepal.

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:54.100
We'll write a book and
everything will be terrific.

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.040
And we'll have this
great success.

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:01.420
And I said no, that sounds
like a terrible idea.

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:05.330
I'm not a mountaineer, and I
wasn't sure I wanted to be

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:10.070
trekking around villages that
are technically off limits to

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:13.290
journalists in Nepal.

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.620
I also wasn't sure it was safe
to be a gay Jewish-American

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:22.040
trekking through regions of
Northern Pakistan that have

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.810
been infested by terrorists or
Taliban, at least, and that

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:29.710
the US embassy had warned
me in a very long letter

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:32.190
to stay away from.

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.780
We didn't have a publisher and
I'd have to quit my job.

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:36.960
And I'd have to interview
people who--

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:39.650
I honestly had no idea if
anybody would be interested in

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:43.110
talking to them.

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:45.740
This book just sounded
like a terrible idea.

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:48.296
So I said no, I'm not going
to do this book.

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.575
But I agreed to look
into the story.

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.750
I've always loved adventure
stories.

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:01.460
And the 2008 disaster on K2--

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:04.810
K2 is a mountain between
China and Pakistan--

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.310
it was one of the
most dramatic.

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:10.620
It was life and death, the
limits of human endurance,

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:14.370
it's triumph and tragedy on a
peak that's so lethal most

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.910
mountaineers consider
it suicide.

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:19.960
And I'm researching this and
I'm seeing photos-- and you

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:21.650
see the photos in the book--

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:24.950
of people right before they
died, or right before they

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:28.455
made big decisions that led
to people living or dying.

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:36.460
I felt like you saw people at
their most elemental level.

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:39.230
The characters were
larger than life.

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:41.090
They were the kind of
people you do not

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:43.280
bump into every day.

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:47.870
It takes a unique kind of
personality to climb up what

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:49.510
many people consider
the world's

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:51.480
most dangerous mountain.

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:55.870
And the characters were often
very difficult people.

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:59.090
And they're trapped inside the
same tents, and they clash

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:01.530
with each other when their lives
depend on them getting

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:04.370
together, or getting
along together.

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:08.300
And you think who they are and
then right when things get

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:11.870
really bad, they turn out
to be somebody else.

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:14.840
And there are characters that
put me in their shoes and I

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:17.570
thought they would put readers
in their shoes.

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:20.160
They make you ask yourself
what you would do under

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:21.690
similar circumstances.

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:26.710
I mean, are you the kind of
person who, when things get

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:30.170
bad, do you go out there
and rescue people?

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:31.350
Do you hang back?

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:33.750
Would you rescue somebody if
they were from a different

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:36.480
country and they spoke a
different language and didn't

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:39.080
have a lot of money?

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:44.050
It makes you ask yourself what
kind of person you are.

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:45.030
And so I thought, OK.

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:48.210
It's a compelling story
with characters that

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:50.100
really draw me in.

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:52.370
But I just felt like that still
wasn't enough to do a

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:55.790
book-- but there are plenty of
adventure stories about people

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:58.110
trying to make it
up a mountain.

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:02.480
And what really appealed to me,
and what really got me to

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:05.580
do this book, is that it
illustrates a much more

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:09.980
universal problem, a problem
that we face nearly every day,

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:12.170
all the time.

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:15.040
Let me explain what
I mean by that.

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:17.220
Amount mountaineers, there
are the Sherpas.

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:20.850
The Sherpas hold this nearly
mythical status.

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:24.810
They have the seemingly
superhuman ability to do some

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:26.810
of the most dangerous and
difficult climbing.

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:32.030
On a commercial expedition they
scout the routes, they

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:34.680
break the trail, they
fix the ropes.

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:40.940
They establish the camps, they
make the food, they take the

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:42.130
climbers to the summit.

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:45.670
They snap the photo that runs
in all the newspapers of the

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:47.020
person on the summit.

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:51.590
They rescue their client when
they fall and slip.

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:53.900
And this is their job.

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:57.100
It's to safely get their
client up and down the

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:59.740
mountain, their often more
celebrated clients.

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:02.970
And their stories
are rarely told.

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:08.060
In some of the most famous
adventure stories of all time,

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:10.870
their names aren't even
included, or it's just one

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:15.380
line and you don't really
know who they are.

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:20.510
And they're the unsung heroes
of some of the most famous

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:22.000
adventure stories.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.300
And that got me thinking that
we usually tell history

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:29.690
through the eyes of the kings
and the Columbuses, not from

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:32.580
the perspective of the help.

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:37.530
And mountaineering shows how
this kind of omission can lead

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:39.120
to a disaster.

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:42.810
That when your life hangs
from a knot, you need to

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:45.680
know who tied it.

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:47.280
You need to know if it
was tied correctly

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:50.880
When you are putting together
a team of people to lead you

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:54.830
up a mountain, you need to know
very basic things about

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:58.530
those people, like whether they
speak the same language.

00:06:58.530 --> 00:07:02.840
And whether they are business
and ethnic rivals who will

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:04.770
work together, and want
to work together,

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:06.760
and can work together.

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:09.670
And when you tell an
incomplete story--

00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:15.330
when you tell a story that omits
crucial perspectives,

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:19.450
what you fail to learn can
lead to a disaster.

00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:23.800
And worse yet, you might not
even find out what really

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:25.260
happened, what the
consequences of

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:26.790
your actions were.

00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:29.300
And people will keep repeating
your errors.

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:33.580
And these were major issue
on K2 in 2008.

00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:39.130
So for the rest of us, for
those of us who aren't K2

00:07:39.130 --> 00:07:42.040
mountaineers, I feel like we're

00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:44.710
largely in the same situation.

00:07:44.710 --> 00:07:48.240
That we all hang from knots that
other people have tied.

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:51.820
That we all have mountains to
summit, and that we're all

00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:55.770
surrounded by people
we rarely notice.

00:07:55.770 --> 00:07:59.130
You think of a person who
prepares your food at a

00:07:59.130 --> 00:08:05.450
restaurant or the cafeteria, and
the last mechanic to check

00:08:05.450 --> 00:08:10.970
the plane before take off, or
the nurse who sterilizes the

00:08:10.970 --> 00:08:14.340
syringe before an injection.

00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:17.515
This book dramatizes the fact
that there are Sherpas, that

00:08:17.515 --> 00:08:21.610
there are people we often
overlook all around us.

00:08:21.610 --> 00:08:25.230
And we cannot afford to ignore
them, that the Sherpas of

00:08:25.230 --> 00:08:28.640
every story need to be seen
for whom they really are

00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:30.912
because our lives
depend on them.

00:08:30.912 --> 00:08:35.539
That, to me, seemed like a good
reason to write a book.

00:08:35.539 --> 00:08:40.360
And that's how I decided
to do it.

00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:44.380
And so I quit my job--

00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:45.520
and it was a nice job.

00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:50.990
And I dove into it and I flew
off, first to Nepal.

00:08:50.990 --> 00:08:55.030
And I quickly learned that doing
journalism in South Asia

00:08:55.030 --> 00:08:59.540
is not at all like doing it
in the United States.

00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:01.590
And I'll give you some
examples of that.

00:09:01.590 --> 00:09:04.920
When I arrived in Kathmandu,
I learned that almost every

00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:08.110
Sherpa has one of seven names.

00:09:08.110 --> 00:09:11.240
It's the day of the week they
were born, male or female.

00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:15.090
So everybody born on Monday
is named Dawa.

00:09:15.090 --> 00:09:17.800
And everybody born on Tuesday
is Mingma and everybody born

00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:20.220
on Wednesday is Lhakpa,
all the way up to

00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:22.950
Sunday, which is Ngima.

00:09:22.950 --> 00:09:25.330
And the last--

00:09:25.330 --> 00:09:27.040
and there are some variations
to that, but there

00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:29.100
are not that many.

00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:31.660
And for a last name almost
all the Sherpas

00:09:31.660 --> 00:09:34.160
use the name Sherpa.

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:40.270
So this system kind of works
in a really small village,

00:09:40.270 --> 00:09:42.060
where everybody knows
each other.

00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:45.060
And you can say, Monday,
the daughter of Monday.

00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:47.250
But in a city--

00:09:47.250 --> 00:09:48.870
honestly it's just
dysfunctional.

00:09:48.870 --> 00:09:50.700
Phone books don't help.

00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:54.655
Gossipers have to provide these
elaborate descriptions

00:09:54.655 --> 00:09:58.200
of the people they're
maligning.

00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:01.520
The nicknames abound, but
names have power.

00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:05.810
And you're not going to tell
an outsider your nickname.

00:10:05.810 --> 00:10:07.950
You're probably not going to
tell many people at all.

00:10:07.950 --> 00:10:12.080
And so tracking down the
right person, just

00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:13.890
figuring out who--

00:10:13.890 --> 00:10:19.540
which Pasang Sherpa out of the
20,000 Pasang Sherpas who live

00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:21.730
in the same neighborhood, which
one is the one you're

00:10:21.730 --> 00:10:26.300
looking for, really
was a challenge.

00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:28.440
And then there were
the villages.

00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:33.650
To do this research I had
to go to villages that--

00:10:33.650 --> 00:10:34.900
you know, getting there--

00:10:37.310 --> 00:10:40.200
I think people have been places
that don't have phones,

00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:42.420
or electricity, or
running water, or

00:10:42.420 --> 00:10:45.280
antibiotics, or petroleum.

00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:47.090
But getting to a lot of the
villages-- there were no

00:10:47.090 --> 00:10:51.820
roads, there was no metal, there
was very little or, I

00:10:51.820 --> 00:10:53.530
don't know if there
was any machinery.

00:10:53.530 --> 00:10:56.020
And it could take weeks
to get there.

00:10:56.020 --> 00:10:57.620
You would go from the
nearest air strip.

00:10:57.620 --> 00:11:00.200
You would just start
backpacking.

00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:07.050
And at each village the
languages were--

00:11:07.050 --> 00:11:09.590
by some anthropologists
considered each language at

00:11:09.590 --> 00:11:12.330
each village a separate
language.

00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:18.360
And so you would have to find
a translator who could speak

00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:21.310
the language there and a common
language with the team

00:11:21.310 --> 00:11:24.720
of translators I was with, to
try to translate to English,

00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:26.770
so I could understand
what was happening.

00:11:26.770 --> 00:11:31.980
And just to be honest, sit down
interviews really didn't

00:11:31.980 --> 00:11:33.490
work that well.

00:11:33.490 --> 00:11:37.020
I would ask questions like,
how old are you?

00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:38.240
And it would go through
two translators.

00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:38.820
How old are you?

00:11:38.820 --> 00:11:39.490
How old are you?

00:11:39.490 --> 00:11:41.890
And there would be a little
discussion between two of the

00:11:41.890 --> 00:11:44.140
people, and then between
the two translators.

00:11:44.140 --> 00:11:48.300
And then finally I would get an
answer that was like I was

00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:52.977
born during the Buddha's
corn festival.

00:11:52.977 --> 00:11:56.730
I'd say, oh, what
year was that?

00:12:00.750 --> 00:12:02.900
I realized that the questions
that I asked just didn't

00:12:02.900 --> 00:12:04.930
always make sense.

00:12:04.930 --> 00:12:09.040
And so to do the research, I
realized at least for the

00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:12.910
significant interviews, this was
going to take a long time.

00:12:12.910 --> 00:12:16.080
But getting places was also
going to take a long time.

00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:20.750
So I just did the interviews by
trekking with the people I

00:12:20.750 --> 00:12:21.770
was interviewing.

00:12:21.770 --> 00:12:24.560
So like, while we were in route
from one village to the

00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:27.430
next, we would just
go as a big group.

00:12:27.430 --> 00:12:31.510
And I would just interview
people all day, every day, for

00:12:31.510 --> 00:12:33.400
weeks at a time.

00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:36.400
And that was-- and with
the main characters, a

00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:37.420
lot longer than that.

00:12:37.420 --> 00:12:40.820
And that was how we were finally
able to get the story.

00:12:40.820 --> 00:12:45.700
And so my point in telling you
all this is that I don't think

00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:50.130
there's a conspiracy to hide
the story of the Sherpas.

00:12:50.130 --> 00:12:53.830
I think it's just a really
challenging story for

00:12:53.830 --> 00:12:58.680
reporters on a deadline
to be able to get.

00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:01.900
We say in the book that we
research for two years and

00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:03.600
that we took seven
trips to Nepal.

00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:06.600
But then we ended up taking nine
trip to Nepal because we

00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:08.770
had to go back and we wanted
to fact check everything to

00:13:08.770 --> 00:13:11.450
make sure we got it right.

00:13:11.450 --> 00:13:13.565
We also took three trips
to Pakistan,

00:13:13.565 --> 00:13:15.080
which is where K2 is.

00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:17.770
And I'll talk about
the Pakistanis

00:13:17.770 --> 00:13:20.300
climbers as well, here.

00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:24.430
And we got unprecedented
access to military and

00:13:24.430 --> 00:13:25.830
government officials.

00:13:25.830 --> 00:13:28.480
Nazir Sabir, who was a
politician and the president

00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:31.360
of the alpine club, went
all out to get

00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:33.250
us incredible access.

00:13:33.250 --> 00:13:37.430
In total we interviewed more
than 200 people at length.

00:13:37.430 --> 00:13:40.650
We also spent countless hours
at kitchen tables in France,

00:13:40.650 --> 00:13:43.840
Holland, Ireland, Italy,
Norway, Serbia, Spain,

00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:46.170
Switzerland and the
United States.

00:13:46.170 --> 00:13:50.490
And we relied on more than 1,000
photographs and videos.

00:13:50.490 --> 00:13:54.280
This is from Pakistan and we're
going across a bridge.

00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:56.930
And at first these bridges look
really scary, but you get

00:13:56.930 --> 00:13:58.465
used to them, actually,
after a while.

00:14:00.990 --> 00:14:02.570
But it gives you an idea
of what some of

00:14:02.570 --> 00:14:03.820
the area looked like.

00:14:06.290 --> 00:14:09.460
You're probably wondering now,
what is this book about?

00:14:09.460 --> 00:14:13.040
And I'm going to jump
right into it.

00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:15.840
It's about a mountaineering
disaster.

00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:19.480
And the disaster lasted
27 hours.

00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:22.590
And I'm going to read us an
excerpt that's from a scene

00:14:22.590 --> 00:14:26.480
that occurs a little bit less
than halfway through.

00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:29.890
"Hanging off the face of a
cliff, an ice axe the only

00:14:29.890 --> 00:14:33.370
thing between him and death, a
Sherpa climber named Chhiring

00:14:33.370 --> 00:14:36.010
Dorje swung to the left.

00:14:36.010 --> 00:14:38.400
A massive ice boulder
ripped off above,

00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:39.820
hurtling toward him.

00:14:39.820 --> 00:14:42.170
It was the size of
a refrigerator.

00:14:42.170 --> 00:14:44.850
The underbelly caught,
and the mass flipped,

00:14:44.850 --> 00:14:46.210
cartwheeling down.

00:14:46.210 --> 00:14:48.300
It tore past, skimming
Chhiring's

00:14:48.300 --> 00:14:50.400
shoulder, then vanished.

00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:51.600
Brooof.

00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:54.050
It slammed into something
below, shattering.

00:14:54.050 --> 00:14:56.030
The mountain ship
with the impact.

00:14:56.030 --> 00:14:58.890
Powder shot up in a column.

00:14:58.890 --> 00:15:02.580
It was near midnight
on August 1, 2008.

00:15:02.580 --> 00:15:06.000
Chhiring had only a hazy
idea of where he was--

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:10.530
on or near the Bottleneck of K2,
the deadliest stretch of

00:15:10.530 --> 00:15:12.470
the most dangerous mountain.

00:15:12.470 --> 00:15:17.210
At roughly the cruising altitude
of a Boeing 737, the

00:15:17.210 --> 00:15:19.660
Bottleneck stretched away
from Chhiring into

00:15:19.660 --> 00:15:21.240
the darkness below.

00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:24.890
In the star light, the channel
seemed bottomless as wisps of

00:15:24.890 --> 00:15:27.350
fog slithered into the abyss.

00:15:27.350 --> 00:15:29.960
Above, a lip of ice curled
like the barrel

00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:32.240
of a crashing wave.

00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:36.520
Oxygen depletion had turned
Chhiring's mind to mush.

00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:38.970
Hunger and exhaustion
had broken his body.

00:15:38.970 --> 00:15:42.420
When he opened his mouth, his
tongue froze; when he gasped

00:15:42.420 --> 00:15:45.750
for breath, the moistureless
air scoured his throat and

00:15:45.750 --> 00:15:47.400
lashed his eyes.

00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:51.620
Chhiring felt robotic, cold,
too tired to think of what

00:15:51.620 --> 00:15:54.040
he'd sacrificed to get to K2.

00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:57.360
The Sherpa mountaineer, who had
summited Everest 10 times,

00:15:57.360 --> 00:16:00.520
had been consumed by
K2 for decades.

00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:04.360
A far more difficult peak than
Everest, K2's summit is one of

00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:07.740
the most prestigious prizes
in mountaineering.

00:16:07.740 --> 00:16:10.800
Chhiring had gone despite his
wife's tears, despite the

00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:13.920
climbing costing more money than
his father had made in 40

00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:17.920
years, despite his Buddhist
lama warning him that K2's

00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:21.210
goddess would never tolerate
the climb.

00:16:21.210 --> 00:16:23.760
Chhiring had made it to the
summit of K2 that evening

00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:27.250
without using bottled oxygen,
vaulting him into an elite

00:16:27.250 --> 00:16:29.280
group of the most successful
mountaineers.

00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:31.970
But the descent wasn't turning
out as planned.

00:16:31.970 --> 00:16:34.020
He had dreamed of the
achievement, a heroic

00:16:34.020 --> 00:16:36.080
reception, even fame.

00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:37.770
None of that mattered now.

00:16:37.770 --> 00:16:40.570
Chhiring had a wife, two
daughters, a thriving business

00:16:40.570 --> 00:16:43.280
and a dozen relatives
who depended on him.

00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:47.480
All he wanted to do was
get home alive."

00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:49.020
So Chhiring--

00:16:49.020 --> 00:16:52.010
he's on the Botteneck of K2.

00:16:52.010 --> 00:16:53.940
That's an excerpt from
the prologue.

00:16:53.940 --> 00:16:57.820
And he can't afford to slip
because it turns that the

00:16:57.820 --> 00:17:01.440
fixed ropes, the ropes that he
was relying on to get down--

00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:05.030
they have been torn out by
a chunk of falling ice.

00:17:05.030 --> 00:17:06.190
Nobody saw.

00:17:06.190 --> 00:17:08.030
It was too dark to see it , it
might have been the size of

00:17:08.030 --> 00:17:08.619
this building.

00:17:08.619 --> 00:17:11.630
It might have the
size of a bus.

00:17:11.630 --> 00:17:14.220
But it had been shredded.

00:17:14.220 --> 00:17:17.436
And so he's coming down the
Bottleneck of K2, you know,

00:17:17.436 --> 00:17:19.119
this wall of ice.

00:17:19.119 --> 00:17:22.020
And he encounters
another climber

00:17:22.020 --> 00:17:23.450
who others have passed.

00:17:23.450 --> 00:17:27.700
This climber, Pasang Lama, has
lost his axe, his ice axe,

00:17:27.700 --> 00:17:29.580
which is a crucial piece
of equipment.

00:17:29.580 --> 00:17:34.580
It's basically impossible to
climb down a wall of ice with

00:17:34.580 --> 00:17:36.740
no rope and no ice axe.

00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:38.280
And so Pasang is stranded.

00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:42.010
He's actually from a different
ethnic group, who the Sherpas

00:17:42.010 --> 00:17:43.560
often consider rivals.

00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:46.900
He's on a different team and
he's preparing to die.

00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:54.670
And Chhiring decided to do what
in some ways just seems

00:17:54.670 --> 00:17:57.290
both heroic and kind
of insane.

00:17:57.290 --> 00:18:02.780
He takes out a piece of rope
from his from his pack, maybe

00:18:02.780 --> 00:18:06.130
an arm length or two across.

00:18:06.130 --> 00:18:08.310
And he ties it on to Pasang.

00:18:08.310 --> 00:18:11.310
And they go down, they start
going down, the deadliest

00:18:11.310 --> 00:18:13.960
stretch of the most dangerous
mountain with Pasang literally

00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:16.310
hanging off Chhiring.

00:18:16.310 --> 00:18:19.820
So that's where I'm going
to pick up the excerpt.

00:18:22.550 --> 00:18:26.050
"Rocks and chunks of
ice spun at them,

00:18:26.050 --> 00:18:27.590
dinging their helmets.

00:18:27.590 --> 00:18:31.310
But they were halfway down and
thought they'd survive.

00:18:31.310 --> 00:18:34.540
The night was windless, minus
4 degrees Fahrenheit, almost

00:18:34.540 --> 00:18:36.200
warm for K2.

00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:39.800
The lights of high camp
were smoldering below.

00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:43.130
Chhiring and Pasang didn't
expect it to happen.

00:18:43.130 --> 00:18:46.950
A chunk of ice or rock knocked
Pasang on the head.

00:18:46.950 --> 00:18:50.040
Batted off the ice, he
swung like a pinata.

00:18:50.040 --> 00:18:53.380
The force of Pasang's body
on the rope peeled

00:18:53.380 --> 00:18:55.070
Chhiring from the slope.

00:18:55.070 --> 00:18:57.230
The men tore downward.

00:18:57.230 --> 00:18:59.910
Chhiring gripped his axe with
both hands and slammed it into

00:18:59.910 --> 00:19:00.910
the mountain.

00:19:00.910 --> 00:19:02.520
The blade wouldn't catch.

00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:05.120
It cut surgically through
the snow.

00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:07.900
Sliding faster, Chhiring heaved
his chest against the

00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:10.820
adz of his axe, digging
into the slope.

00:19:10.820 --> 00:19:11.470
No good--

00:19:11.470 --> 00:19:14.970
Chhiring fell faster, another
seven yards, another ten.

00:19:14.970 --> 00:19:18.910
Pasang punched the slope with
his fists and tried to grip,

00:19:18.910 --> 00:19:21.360
but his fingers skated
along the ice.

00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:24.140
Chhiring and Pasang, as they
fell into the darkness, must

00:19:24.140 --> 00:19:28.470
have wondered, how
did this happen?"

00:19:28.470 --> 00:19:33.680
Part of what attracted me to
this story was that initial

00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:35.980
question, how did this happen?

00:19:35.980 --> 00:19:41.600
But to dig deeper, I had to get

00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:43.400
answers to tougher questions.

00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:45.780
And I'm going to read and
excerpt that gives you a sense

00:19:45.780 --> 00:19:47.075
of what I mean by that.

00:19:49.900 --> 00:19:52.010
"Many of the alpinists consider
themselves to be

00:19:52.010 --> 00:19:53.980
among the best in the world.

00:19:53.980 --> 00:19:57.250
Some had risked everything
to scale K2.

00:19:57.250 --> 00:20:00.330
Their climb had devolved
into a catastrophe.

00:20:00.330 --> 00:20:01.780
The final toll was bleak.

00:20:01.780 --> 00:20:06.080
Within 27 hours, 11 climbers
had died in the deadliest

00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:09.220
single disaster in K2 history.

00:20:09.220 --> 00:20:10.640
What had gone wrong?

00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:13.890
Why had the climbers continued
up when they knew they'd never

00:20:13.890 --> 00:20:16.890
make it down before nightfall?

00:20:16.890 --> 00:20:20.030
How had they made so many
simple mistakes such as

00:20:20.030 --> 00:20:22.120
failing to bring enough rope?

00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:25.170
The story became an
international media sensation,

00:20:25.170 --> 00:20:27.640
landing on the covers of the
"New York Times," "National

00:20:27.640 --> 00:20:30.800
Geographic Adventure,"
"Outside," and in more than

00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:32.910
1,000 other publications.

00:20:32.910 --> 00:20:35.360
It ricocheted around the
blogosphere and inspired

00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:39.150
speculation, documentaries, a
stage play revival, memoirs,

00:20:39.150 --> 00:20:40.860
and talk shows.

00:20:40.860 --> 00:20:44.360
Some considered the climb
an example of hubris.

00:20:44.360 --> 00:20:48.160
A waste of life fueled by
machismo or madness, thrill

00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:50.980
seekers trying too hard to
get noticed by corporate

00:20:50.980 --> 00:20:55.100
sponsorship, lunatics climbing
in a final act of escape,

00:20:55.100 --> 00:20:57.670
oblivious Westerners exploiting
the lives of

00:20:57.670 --> 00:21:02.210
impoverished Nepalese and
Pakistanis in a bid for glory.

00:21:02.210 --> 00:21:05.310
'You want to risk your life?',
a response to one of the "New

00:21:05.310 --> 00:21:07.520
York Times" stories said.

00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:10.490
'Then do it in service of your
country, or family, or

00:21:10.490 --> 00:21:11.700
neighborhood.

00:21:11.700 --> 00:21:15.960
Climbing K2 or Everest is a
selfish stunt that benefits

00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:17.760
nothing.'

00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:19.820
Others saw courage--

00:21:19.820 --> 00:21:23.540
explorers pitted against the
adversity of nature, lost

00:21:23.540 --> 00:21:27.110
souls embracing risk to find
meaning in an empty world.

00:21:27.110 --> 00:21:31.120
'Climbing can expand the view of
human potential for all of

00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:34.590
us,' read a letter from Phil
Powers, executive director of

00:21:34.590 --> 00:21:38.110
the American Alpine club.

00:21:38.110 --> 00:21:40.930
Several people raised
basic questions.

00:21:40.930 --> 00:21:43.090
What do men and women do
when they're on top

00:21:43.090 --> 00:21:44.760
of a mountain dying?

00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:48.350
And why are some people driven
to take such risks?

00:21:48.350 --> 00:21:50.850
Before they were trapped on the
mountain top, before the

00:21:50.850 --> 00:21:53.950
deaths and funerals, before
the rescues and reunions,

00:21:53.950 --> 00:21:56.000
before the fistfights and
friendships, before the

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:59.320
recriminations and
reconciliations, everything

00:21:59.320 --> 00:22:01.040
had seemed perfect.

00:22:01.040 --> 00:22:03.780
The equipment was checked
and rechecked.

00:22:03.780 --> 00:22:05.370
The routes established,
the weather

00:22:05.370 --> 00:22:07.910
cooperative, the teams intact--

00:22:07.910 --> 00:22:11.390
the moment they had spent so
much time and training and

00:22:11.390 --> 00:22:15.130
money to reach, summit date
had finally come.

00:22:15.130 --> 00:22:17.160
They were going to conquer K2.

00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:19.920
Stand on top of the most vicious
mountain on earth,

00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:23.120
howl in triumph, unfurl their
flags, and call their

00:22:23.120 --> 00:22:30.500
sweethearts."

00:22:30.500 --> 00:22:34.630
I want to give you an
idea of what K2 is.

00:22:34.630 --> 00:22:37.300
It's the second tallest
mountain and

00:22:37.300 --> 00:22:38.460
here's where it's located.

00:22:38.460 --> 00:22:42.900
It's between China
and Pakistan.

00:22:46.760 --> 00:22:49.230
This is what it looks like.

00:22:49.230 --> 00:22:51.270
It has a much slimmer
profile than

00:22:51.270 --> 00:22:53.090
Everest and is much steeper.

00:22:56.020 --> 00:23:00.130
This is what it looks like from
the Bottleneck, you're

00:23:00.130 --> 00:23:01.690
below or slightly below it.

00:23:01.690 --> 00:23:05.060
If you could imagine this
photo's actually looking up.

00:23:05.060 --> 00:23:09.820
So that ice there hangs over the
climbers like a balcony.

00:23:09.820 --> 00:23:12.330
And the glacier on the mountain
is pushing off chunks

00:23:12.330 --> 00:23:17.150
every once in awhile, especially
when the ice is

00:23:17.150 --> 00:23:21.250
refreezing at night.

00:23:21.250 --> 00:23:24.260
This is the view from the summit
of the Karakoram range.

00:23:24.260 --> 00:23:28.370
It hooks into the Himalaya,
it's a younger range.

00:23:28.370 --> 00:23:32.325
So it hasn't been chiseled down
as much by the elements,

00:23:32.325 --> 00:23:34.520
it's much sharper.

00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:39.000
"K2 lacks the mass of Everest,
but it's sleeker and meaner.

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:41.390
Climbers call it the
savage mountain.

00:23:41.390 --> 00:23:44.880
Its peak has all the obstacles
of Everest and more.

00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:47.660
K2's glaciers are riddled
with fissures concealed

00:23:47.660 --> 00:23:49.290
by layers of snow.

00:23:49.290 --> 00:23:52.480
Climbers step on these
crevasses, punch through, and

00:23:52.480 --> 00:23:53.660
if unroped--

00:23:53.660 --> 00:23:54.960
disappear.

00:23:54.960 --> 00:23:58.340
Blocks of ice cleave off
overhanging glaciers.

00:23:58.340 --> 00:24:00.620
Avalanches roar down
icy flanks.

00:24:00.620 --> 00:24:02.890
And then there's the altitude.

00:24:02.890 --> 00:24:06.030
No human plant or animal can
tolerate such harsh conditions

00:24:06.030 --> 00:24:07.920
for more than a few days.

00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:11.730
With each lungful of air,
climbers on the summit suck in

00:24:11.730 --> 00:24:14.880
only a third of the oxygen they
breathe at sea level.

00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:17.900
Oxygen deprivation saps
their strength and

00:24:17.900 --> 00:24:20.040
compromises their judgment.

00:24:20.040 --> 00:24:23.240
Altitude illness breaks them,
giving some the coordination

00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:24.510
of toddlers.

00:24:24.510 --> 00:24:26.890
As if these difficulties weren't
enough, storms are

00:24:26.890 --> 00:24:28.710
harsher on K2.

00:24:28.710 --> 00:24:33.120
It stands 882 miles northwest of
Everest, and being further

00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:36.350
from the equator, is more
vulnerable to unpredictable

00:24:36.350 --> 00:24:38.360
extra tropical cyclones
and their

00:24:38.360 --> 00:24:40.360
accompanying jet streams.

00:24:40.360 --> 00:24:43.490
All of this makes for
dismal statistics.

00:24:43.490 --> 00:24:48.760
Before 2008, only 278 people
had stood on K2's summit.

00:24:48.760 --> 00:24:53.890
Everest's summit roll was 4,115
and its fatality rate,

00:24:53.890 --> 00:24:57.110
the percentage of climbers who
went above base camp and died,

00:24:57.110 --> 00:25:02.600
had averaged 0.7% for
the previous decade.

00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:04.640
Although the Himalayan database
crunches these

00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:06.980
numbers for Everest,
no accurate

00:25:06.980 --> 00:25:08.990
statistics exist for K2.

00:25:08.990 --> 00:25:11.300
Climbers of the savage mountain
can't reliably

00:25:11.300 --> 00:25:15.020
approximate their chances of
survival and don't want to.

00:25:15.020 --> 00:25:18.930
In 2008, the fatality rate of
those leaving base camp for a

00:25:18.930 --> 00:25:23.720
summit bid was 30.5%, higher
than the casualty rate at

00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:26.250
Omaha Beach on D-day.

00:25:26.250 --> 00:25:29.850
Among high altitude climbers, if
not statisticians, there's

00:25:29.850 --> 00:25:30.900
no comparison.

00:25:30.900 --> 00:25:34.360
K2 is more lethal
than Everest."

00:25:34.360 --> 00:25:38.770
Here is a photo of the
two main characters.

00:25:38.770 --> 00:25:42.660
Last I was reading about them,
they were hanging off the

00:25:42.660 --> 00:25:48.340
Bottleneck, off an ice axe in
the Bottleneck sliding down.

00:25:48.340 --> 00:25:51.090
Chhiring is the one who had the
ice axe, and Pasang is the

00:25:51.090 --> 00:25:52.550
one who was hanging
off of him.

00:25:52.550 --> 00:25:54.760
Chhiring is on your
right, my left.

00:25:58.100 --> 00:26:00.880
I actually got to bring this
book to Kathmandu and got to

00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:03.810
let them see it before
it came out.

00:26:03.810 --> 00:26:07.640
So this is them seeing the
book for the first time.

00:26:07.640 --> 00:26:10.020
I want to give you a little
flavor of who the characters

00:26:10.020 --> 00:26:13.400
are, so I'm going to read
an excerpt that

00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:15.110
characterizes Chhiring.

00:26:15.110 --> 00:26:17.090
He is the one on your right.

00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:22.650
"His walk was more of a jog.

00:26:22.650 --> 00:26:25.790
He didn't drive a car, he
rocketed through traffic on a

00:26:25.790 --> 00:26:28.470
black Honda Hero motorcycle.

00:26:28.470 --> 00:26:31.720
In the seven languages he
spoke conversationally,

00:26:31.720 --> 00:26:34.880
Chhiring Dorje Sherpa talked so
quickly it seemed as though

00:26:34.880 --> 00:26:37.600
each sentence were one long
word, punctuated by

00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:39.640
exclamation points.

00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:42.470
Everything about him was
accelerated, his eating, his

00:26:42.470 --> 00:26:44.910
thinking, his climbing,
his praying.

00:26:44.910 --> 00:26:46.800
He couldn't control the pace.

00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:49.900
Speed was hardwired
into his DNA.

00:26:49.900 --> 00:26:53.660
His first name meant long life,
but its pronunciation to

00:26:53.660 --> 00:26:57.810
English speakers, cheering,
personified him.

00:26:57.810 --> 00:27:00.490
Cheerful determination radiated
from Chhiring.

00:27:00.490 --> 00:27:01.460
It got him noticed.

00:27:01.460 --> 00:27:04.890
Clients praised his, you can
do it, let's rock and roll,

00:27:04.890 --> 00:27:07.000
give me your pack attitude.

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:08.530
It was contagious.

00:27:08.530 --> 00:27:11.420
How could you sit still at camp
when every few minutes he

00:27:11.420 --> 00:27:14.100
would lurch up, stride forward,
chops his arms

00:27:14.100 --> 00:27:16.850
through the air, make a
pronouncement, plop down, and

00:27:16.850 --> 00:27:18.220
spring up again?

00:27:18.220 --> 00:27:20.900
There was a reason was
34-year-old dynamo rarely

00:27:20.900 --> 00:27:22.140
drank coffee.

00:27:22.140 --> 00:27:24.490
He was caffeinated enough.

00:27:24.490 --> 00:27:28.050
'Chhiring was always crazy,'
said his father, Ngawang

00:27:28.050 --> 00:27:29.590
Thundu Sherpa.

00:27:29.590 --> 00:27:33.010
'He was a naughty child, and
I knew he'd be a naughty

00:27:33.010 --> 00:27:37.410
adult.'" Here's Chhiring
on the summit of K2.

00:27:41.840 --> 00:27:45.110
Then the other major character
is Pasang,

00:27:45.110 --> 00:27:48.110
who is on your left.

00:27:48.110 --> 00:27:50.880
And this will be the last
excerpt I'll read, but it

00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:52.230
gives you an idea
of who he is.

00:27:55.450 --> 00:27:58.810
"A sticker on his helmet labeled
him the Joker, and

00:27:58.810 --> 00:28:00.910
Pasang lived up to it.

00:28:00.910 --> 00:28:03.270
He smuggled rocks into friend's
sleeping bags,

00:28:03.270 --> 00:28:05.030
pillows and packs.

00:28:05.030 --> 00:28:07.890
He wrapped pebbles in Tootsie
Roll wrappers and handed them

00:28:07.890 --> 00:28:11.010
to children begging for candy.

00:28:11.010 --> 00:28:14.740
At night he festooned tents with
branch-and-trash towers.

00:28:14.740 --> 00:28:17.170
When the tents' occupants
crawled out in the morning and

00:28:17.170 --> 00:28:20.550
the scaffolds crashed down,
Pasang threw back his head,

00:28:20.550 --> 00:28:24.710
cackling, and galloped off in
search of his next victim.

00:28:24.710 --> 00:28:27.240
When in the city he was
someone different.

00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:30.650
He cloaked this happy-go-lucky
personality in an armor of

00:28:30.650 --> 00:28:32.800
shyness and caution.

00:28:32.800 --> 00:28:35.300
Men like Chhiring bounded
up to newcomers with the

00:28:35.300 --> 00:28:38.270
enthusiasm of a Labrador,
no matter the setting.

00:28:38.270 --> 00:28:41.500
In Kathmandu, Pasang
couldn't do that.

00:28:41.500 --> 00:28:44.410
He hung back, keeping
a safe distance.

00:28:44.410 --> 00:28:47.160
When acquaintances opened their
arms for a hug, they

00:28:47.160 --> 00:28:48.830
received a handshake.

00:28:48.830 --> 00:28:50.990
While eating dinner with a
group of new clients in

00:28:50.990 --> 00:28:54.430
Kathmandu, Pasang's body
was at the table.

00:28:54.430 --> 00:28:56.890
But his eyes were patrolling
the room, ready to

00:28:56.890 --> 00:28:58.600
alert him of danger.

00:28:58.600 --> 00:29:00.420
It often took him several
hours to crack

00:29:00.420 --> 00:29:02.050
a smile for a stranger.

00:29:02.050 --> 00:29:05.580
But when he allowed one,
his grin was sincere.

00:29:05.580 --> 00:29:10.170
Compact, stretching just shy of
five foot two, Pasang had

00:29:10.170 --> 00:29:12.760
hands as rough as
a cat's tongue.

00:29:12.760 --> 00:29:16.190
When he was 24 years old, he
looked 15 and accepted his

00:29:16.190 --> 00:29:18.420
nickname, little Pasang.

00:29:18.420 --> 00:29:21.310
Clients occasionally doubted
that he was an adult and asked

00:29:21.310 --> 00:29:24.950
for, quote, 'another Sherpa with
more experience than this

00:29:24.950 --> 00:29:28.760
baby.' To age himself,
Pasang rarely shaved.

00:29:28.760 --> 00:29:30.360
But it made no difference.

00:29:30.360 --> 00:29:35.980
His chin refused to
grow a beard."

00:29:35.980 --> 00:29:40.820
Throughout writing this book
I felt a tremendous

00:29:40.820 --> 00:29:43.110
responsibility and respect
for the characters.

00:29:43.110 --> 00:29:47.880
Many of them lost their lives,
or saw other people lose their

00:29:47.880 --> 00:29:52.670
lives, or had family members
lost their lives.

00:29:52.670 --> 00:29:55.130
And they had to do really tough
interviews with me.

00:29:55.130 --> 00:29:58.550
And in a way, this story is
a really horrifying story.

00:29:58.550 --> 00:30:03.700
But in a way it's also a
really inspiring story.

00:30:03.700 --> 00:30:08.590
You see people who started off
in small villages and become

00:30:08.590 --> 00:30:12.790
some of the best athletes in the
world, often athletes no

00:30:12.790 --> 00:30:15.090
one else has heard of,
but among the best.

00:30:15.090 --> 00:30:21.340
And they pull off some feats
that just seem unimaginable.

00:30:21.340 --> 00:30:24.350
And so I want to say I'm
grateful to my friends who

00:30:24.350 --> 00:30:26.510
helped me see the top of the
world through their eyes,

00:30:26.510 --> 00:30:28.620
because without their
willingness, this book would

00:30:28.620 --> 00:30:30.270
have been possible.

00:30:30.270 --> 00:30:36.000
And my hope is that, when you
read this book, that Amanda

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:39.100
and I have made a small
contribution to the way we

00:30:39.100 --> 00:30:39.950
tell stories.

00:30:39.950 --> 00:30:44.030
And that this story gives you
a glimpse into yourself, and

00:30:44.030 --> 00:30:49.810
helps you recognize and more
deeply appreciate the Sherpas

00:30:49.810 --> 00:30:51.150
who are in your life.

00:30:51.150 --> 00:30:53.420
Thank you very much, and I'm
happy to answer questions.

00:30:53.420 --> 00:31:00.110
[APPLAUSE]

00:31:00.110 --> 00:31:02.740
AUDIENCE: I guess I'll start
with a question about your

00:31:02.740 --> 00:31:04.750
decision to write the book.

00:31:04.750 --> 00:31:09.120
Where you at all intimidated
by "Into Thin Air?"

00:31:09.120 --> 00:31:10.970
PETER ZUCKERMAN: It's one
of those weird things of

00:31:10.970 --> 00:31:13.350
publishing is, on the one hand,
there's been a book

00:31:13.350 --> 00:31:15.310
that's been extremely popular.

00:31:15.310 --> 00:31:17.980
So that shows that, hey,
there might be

00:31:17.980 --> 00:31:20.030
room for another book.

00:31:20.030 --> 00:31:24.250
On the other hand you're like,
wow, I'm always going to--

00:31:24.250 --> 00:31:29.940
like that's what roughly
established the genre.

00:31:29.940 --> 00:31:31.840
And I think "Into Thin
Air" s a good book.

00:31:31.840 --> 00:31:33.700
I enjoyed it.

00:31:33.700 --> 00:31:37.010
I feel like this is sort of
the corollary, where "Into

00:31:37.010 --> 00:31:40.840
Thin Air" is a first person
story told from Jon Krakauer's

00:31:40.840 --> 00:31:42.570
perspective.

00:31:42.570 --> 00:31:44.440
And this is a more--

00:31:47.780 --> 00:31:50.150
I don't want to say more
complete, but a more

00:31:50.150 --> 00:31:54.360
reporter's account told from the
eyes of the Sherpas, who

00:31:54.360 --> 00:31:56.620
do a lot of the-- who, you
know, fix the ropes that

00:31:56.620 --> 00:32:00.370
people like Jon Krakauer
were going up.

00:32:00.370 --> 00:32:02.060
But yeah, it's a good book.

00:32:02.060 --> 00:32:03.605
It's a little bit
intimidating.

00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:09.390
AUDIENCE: So I think we can
all agree that the primary

00:32:09.390 --> 00:32:13.510
responsibility for making the
poor decisions up on the

00:32:13.510 --> 00:32:16.440
mountain belong to the people
that make the decisions.

00:32:16.440 --> 00:32:20.160
How much responsibility do you
think the Sherpas should share

00:32:20.160 --> 00:32:24.450
for enabling people who may
not be fully prepared or

00:32:24.450 --> 00:32:28.160
capable of making the climb to
attempt something that they

00:32:28.160 --> 00:32:31.090
maybe shouldn't be doing?

00:32:31.090 --> 00:32:34.870
PETER ZUCKERMAN: There's some
fundamental conflicts.

00:32:34.870 --> 00:32:39.180
The Sherpas get paid, in part,
based on how many people make

00:32:39.180 --> 00:32:39.940
it to the summit.

00:32:39.940 --> 00:32:41.660
You get a summit bonus.

00:32:41.660 --> 00:32:45.920
So there's a clear incentive,
especially when your families

00:32:45.920 --> 00:32:49.780
relying on your income from that
climb for the rest of the

00:32:49.780 --> 00:32:54.130
year, or for much of the
rest of the year--

00:32:54.130 --> 00:32:56.850
there's a definite incentive
to get your client to the

00:32:56.850 --> 00:32:59.640
summit so you get that bonus.

00:32:59.640 --> 00:33:04.240
And Sherpas will say, oh, I'm
not going to take someone up

00:33:04.240 --> 00:33:05.290
there who's going to die.

00:33:05.290 --> 00:33:09.780
But certainly I keep that in
mind when I'm trying to decide

00:33:09.780 --> 00:33:13.180
whether or not I need to tell
somebody to turn around.

00:33:13.180 --> 00:33:16.570
So that's just-- in my opinion,
I think a better

00:33:16.570 --> 00:33:19.430
system would be you pay the
Sherpas based on how many

00:33:19.430 --> 00:33:24.020
people make it back alive,
or something like that.

00:33:24.020 --> 00:33:25.730
I don't know if that model
has been explored.

00:33:28.900 --> 00:33:32.835
And a lot of the decisions just
weren't really decisions.

00:33:32.835 --> 00:33:34.085
They were just miscommunication.

00:33:36.920 --> 00:33:41.530
The client climbers--

00:33:41.530 --> 00:33:43.980
one of the problems of this
disaster is there was one

00:33:43.980 --> 00:33:47.130
person who sort of could
translate from the high

00:33:47.130 --> 00:33:53.460
altitude workers
to the clients.

00:33:53.460 --> 00:33:56.590
And he got trapped down
on a lower camp.

00:33:56.590 --> 00:33:59.610
So in a sense, a big part
of the problem was there

00:33:59.610 --> 00:34:01.080
was just not much--

00:34:01.080 --> 00:34:05.070
there weren't decisions being
made in a strategic way.

00:34:05.070 --> 00:34:09.150
It was just sort of lack
of communication.

00:34:09.150 --> 00:34:11.699
And then you want to say
well, then why didn't

00:34:11.699 --> 00:34:14.020
they just turn around?

00:34:14.020 --> 00:34:18.560
And it's hard when you've been--
when you've spent so

00:34:18.560 --> 00:34:22.120
much time, and so many years,
waiting for this.

00:34:22.120 --> 00:34:25.770
And it's your third attempt at
K2 but the other two seasons

00:34:25.770 --> 00:34:28.560
you came the weather just never
opened up, so there was

00:34:28.560 --> 00:34:30.340
no chance to even go
for the summit.

00:34:30.340 --> 00:34:33.760
And this is your one
last chance to go.

00:34:33.760 --> 00:34:35.080
It's really hard.

00:34:35.080 --> 00:34:36.960
I'm not saying it's the wrong
decision to turn around.

00:34:36.960 --> 00:34:40.030
But it's a really hard decision
to turn around.

00:34:40.030 --> 00:34:44.130
So I don't think there's
an easy--

00:34:44.130 --> 00:34:48.210
that the blame could be spread
out among the whole, like on

00:34:48.210 --> 00:34:51.400
individual decisions,
on cultural lack of

00:34:51.400 --> 00:34:56.480
understanding, on a whole
systemic problems.

00:34:56.480 --> 00:34:59.300
There's no limit to the number
of people who can climb up all

00:34:59.300 --> 00:35:02.800
at once and so overcrowding
is a big contributor.

00:35:02.800 --> 00:35:04.410
Do you blame Pakistan
for that?

00:35:04.410 --> 00:35:04.880
I don't know.

00:35:04.880 --> 00:35:09.150
Or do you blame the climbers who
all want to go up and are

00:35:09.150 --> 00:35:11.450
lobbying to let as many
people go up at once.

00:35:11.450 --> 00:35:14.500
Or do you say that's a fine
system because that's the most

00:35:14.500 --> 00:35:16.040
fair system?

00:35:16.040 --> 00:35:18.670
So I don't think there's
a clear answer to that.

00:35:18.670 --> 00:35:22.940
AUDIENCE: How are the
professional climbers like you

00:35:22.940 --> 00:35:25.010
spoke to-- the Sherpas
who do this--

00:35:25.010 --> 00:35:29.510
how are they viewed within
their own community?

00:35:29.510 --> 00:35:31.730
Within the Sherpa community,
how are they seen?

00:35:31.730 --> 00:35:32.800
Are they seen as

00:35:32.800 --> 00:35:37.310
irresponsible, or are they heroes?

00:35:37.310 --> 00:35:38.360
PETER ZUCKERMAN: There's
a range.

00:35:38.360 --> 00:35:43.640
Some climbers have a terrible
reputation and nobody wants to

00:35:43.640 --> 00:35:44.930
work for them.

00:35:44.930 --> 00:35:51.180
And in this book there's a
Korean team and Mr. Kim has a

00:35:51.180 --> 00:35:54.130
really bad reputation among the
Sherpas, and nobody wants

00:35:54.130 --> 00:35:55.570
to work for him.

00:35:55.570 --> 00:35:59.350
And so, frankly, the people who
work for him are the ones

00:35:59.350 --> 00:36:03.820
who really desperately
need to work.

00:36:03.820 --> 00:36:07.010
Their families are really
relying on them and they don't

00:36:07.010 --> 00:36:08.980
have that many other options.

00:36:08.980 --> 00:36:13.010
And he has--

00:36:13.010 --> 00:36:16.390
for libel reasons, there's
some things that I can't

00:36:16.390 --> 00:36:18.270
necessarily say that
he's done.

00:36:18.270 --> 00:36:22.100
But I would say that he had a
reputation for fighting with

00:36:22.100 --> 00:36:25.160
the Sherpas and forcing them to
do things that they thought

00:36:25.160 --> 00:36:26.410
were suicide missions.

00:36:30.950 --> 00:36:33.170
Then there are other climbers
who really know the Sherpas,

00:36:33.170 --> 00:36:35.310
who speak their language
and have really been

00:36:35.310 --> 00:36:38.280
advocates for them.

00:36:38.280 --> 00:36:42.920
And that have a great reputation
among the Sherpas.

00:36:42.920 --> 00:36:44.120
And there's some--

00:36:44.120 --> 00:36:47.740
and then there's a current
movement which a lot of the

00:36:47.740 --> 00:36:50.740
Sherpas don't like, where the
Western climbers are saying,

00:36:50.740 --> 00:36:52.180
we're going to do
this ourselves,

00:36:52.180 --> 00:36:54.740
without Sherpa support.

00:36:54.740 --> 00:36:57.500
And in a way that's a more
impressive way to climb a

00:36:57.500 --> 00:37:00.960
mountain but it's something
that the Sherpas don't

00:37:00.960 --> 00:37:03.420
necessarily like because
they lose business.

00:37:03.420 --> 00:37:07.430
And so there can be resentment
from the Sherpas.

00:37:07.430 --> 00:37:09.400
And the Sherpas aren't
always nice, either.

00:37:14.430 --> 00:37:18.120
I would say that the reputations
depend on the

00:37:18.120 --> 00:37:22.780
individuals very much, and that
there's a huge range.

00:37:22.780 --> 00:37:25.330
AUDIENCE: A kind of interesting
question to me is,

00:37:25.330 --> 00:37:28.750
among the Sherpa population
in general--

00:37:28.750 --> 00:37:33.580
not every Sherpa villager
does this for a living.

00:37:33.580 --> 00:37:37.300
I'm assuming it's a small
minority who actually do this.

00:37:37.300 --> 00:37:39.540
It's a hard and dangerous job.

00:37:39.540 --> 00:37:42.010
How are the Sherpa
who do this.

00:37:42.010 --> 00:37:48.600
how are they viewed within the
larger Sherpa community?

00:37:48.600 --> 00:37:49.040
PETER ZUCKERMAN: The view--

00:37:49.040 --> 00:37:50.915
I would say the view
is shifting.

00:37:54.540 --> 00:38:02.180
During the very early climbs,
the late 1800s, early 1900s,

00:38:02.180 --> 00:38:03.050
the mountains--

00:38:03.050 --> 00:38:05.620
the gods lived in
the mountains.

00:38:05.620 --> 00:38:10.100
And climbing a mountain was a
sin and what you were doing

00:38:10.100 --> 00:38:12.340
was going to not just harm you,
it was going to harm your

00:38:12.340 --> 00:38:13.900
whole family.

00:38:13.900 --> 00:38:16.210
And people--

00:38:16.210 --> 00:38:18.210
a lot of people who
went climbing were

00:38:18.210 --> 00:38:20.970
really looked down on.

00:38:20.970 --> 00:38:24.510
But there's been sort of
a shifting view, where

00:38:24.510 --> 00:38:26.060
especially on Mount Everest--

00:38:26.060 --> 00:38:30.300
well, Mount Everest's goddess,
she has a gold face.

00:38:30.300 --> 00:38:34.670
She flies around on I
forget the type--

00:38:34.670 --> 00:38:35.160
is it a zebra?

00:38:35.160 --> 00:38:38.030
I forget.

00:38:38.030 --> 00:38:40.600
And she's the goddess
of prosperity.

00:38:40.600 --> 00:38:42.520
And maybe she makes
an exception.

00:38:42.520 --> 00:38:45.890
Because lots of people are
making it up Everest without

00:38:45.890 --> 00:38:47.880
getting hurt, lots of people
are getting rich.

00:38:47.880 --> 00:38:51.060
So maybe it's OK to climb
Everest if you

00:38:51.060 --> 00:38:52.630
make a lot of money.

00:38:52.630 --> 00:38:56.240
And so there's been this
growing acceptance of,

00:38:56.240 --> 00:38:58.420
climbing is--

00:38:58.420 --> 00:38:59.890
maybe it's a really
good profession.

00:38:59.890 --> 00:39:05.000
Because you talk to old Sherpas
and they'll say, well,

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:06.540
I used to think it was
really terrible.

00:39:06.540 --> 00:39:09.190
But now my son comes home and
look, I got new shoes.

00:39:09.190 --> 00:39:17.360
And I have a nice tin roof
over my house here.

00:39:17.360 --> 00:39:19.460
And so now I'm thinking
mountaineering's a good thing.

00:39:19.460 --> 00:39:23.910
So I would say that there is
a shift in the culture,

00:39:23.910 --> 00:39:25.840
happening as we speak.

00:39:25.840 --> 00:39:28.480
And it's becoming more
and more acceptable.

00:39:28.480 --> 00:39:31.990
And among the youngest people,
my observations where that

00:39:31.990 --> 00:39:34.890
they typically thought
mountaineering was fine.

00:39:34.890 --> 00:39:38.320
I mean, that's a good way to
make a living, albeit a

00:39:38.320 --> 00:39:40.530
dangerous one.

00:39:40.530 --> 00:39:45.050
And then I'd say the Sherpa
children born today, they're

00:39:45.050 --> 00:39:46.070
getting educations.

00:39:46.070 --> 00:39:49.700
And their parents often say, I'm
doing this job so my kids

00:39:49.700 --> 00:39:50.950
don't have to have it.

00:39:53.110 --> 00:39:57.110
And I should add that Sherpa
is a really complex term.

00:39:57.110 --> 00:39:58.980
The Sherpas who live
near Everest say

00:39:58.980 --> 00:40:00.300
it's an ethnic group.

00:40:00.300 --> 00:40:03.720
The people who live further from
Everest say it's a job

00:40:03.720 --> 00:40:07.340
description because people
want to hire a Sherpa.

00:40:07.340 --> 00:40:10.420
And then there are the high
altitude workers in Pakistan

00:40:10.420 --> 00:40:13.540
who are often called high
altitude porters which can be

00:40:13.540 --> 00:40:17.820
a disparaging term in some
people's eyes from

00:40:17.820 --> 00:40:18.970
[INAUDIBLE].

00:40:18.970 --> 00:40:23.080
And so it's a-- but I think in
Pakistan it's just kind of

00:40:23.080 --> 00:40:24.220
what they're called.

00:40:24.220 --> 00:40:29.400
And so there's a lot of dispute
over what a Sherpa is,

00:40:29.400 --> 00:40:30.770
and a lot of money at stake.

00:40:30.770 --> 00:40:34.220
Because people want to hire a
Sherpa, and so everybody says

00:40:34.220 --> 00:40:36.720
they're a Sherpa.

00:40:36.720 --> 00:40:41.170
And the people who have a
stronger claim of being ethnic

00:40:41.170 --> 00:40:42.700
Sherpas say that's not right.

00:40:42.700 --> 00:40:46.800
And the people whose lives
depend on Sherpa workers say,

00:40:46.800 --> 00:40:48.290
no, it's just a job
description.

00:40:48.290 --> 00:40:51.330
And our lives matter too, and
we shouldn't have this

00:40:51.330 --> 00:40:54.070
celebrity ethnicity.

00:40:54.070 --> 00:40:56.740
AUDIENCE: Could you elaborate
a little bit on what it

00:40:56.740 --> 00:41:00.370
typically costs to fund an
expedition of this caliber?

00:41:00.370 --> 00:41:04.650
And what a Sherpa could expect
to get for taking those risks?

00:41:04.650 --> 00:41:09.100
And also as a second part two,
it sounded like you just kind

00:41:09.100 --> 00:41:12.070
of did your research and
then got on a plane.

00:41:12.070 --> 00:41:15.600
Maybe talk a little bit about
your journey, did you have to

00:41:15.600 --> 00:41:17.450
get sponsors to do
your research?

00:41:17.450 --> 00:41:20.160
And kind of what that
process was like.

00:41:20.160 --> 00:41:22.310
PETER ZUCKERMAN: It depends
on how you want to climb.

00:41:22.310 --> 00:41:26.690
If you want to climb with a huge
team of porters who are

00:41:26.690 --> 00:41:30.730
going to bring you a generator
to run your computer, and

00:41:30.730 --> 00:41:34.350
serve you really good food
and such, the costs

00:41:34.350 --> 00:41:35.390
can get really high.

00:41:35.390 --> 00:41:38.130
Especially I'd say the high end
of an Everest expedition

00:41:38.130 --> 00:41:44.450
will get $150, $175,000
per person.

00:41:44.450 --> 00:41:46.790
It can.

00:41:46.790 --> 00:41:49.720
Some people do very bare
bones expeditions.

00:41:49.720 --> 00:41:52.750
And on K2 the permit is--

00:41:52.750 --> 00:41:55.070
I'm trying to remember what it
is right now, but it's a lot

00:41:55.070 --> 00:41:55.970
cheaper than Everest.

00:41:55.970 --> 00:41:59.200
It's less than $10,000.

00:41:59.200 --> 00:42:07.200
And on K2, if you're just doing
a bare bones expedition

00:42:07.200 --> 00:42:09.970
and you're planning to do it all
yourself, I mean I think

00:42:09.970 --> 00:42:14.360
you can probably do it
for around $10,000.

00:42:14.360 --> 00:42:15.990
Maybe less if you're
really good.

00:42:18.730 --> 00:42:22.730
So there's considerable
range in cost.

00:42:22.730 --> 00:42:26.480
In terms of the cost of doing
this project, the biggest

00:42:26.480 --> 00:42:29.900
expense is getting there.

00:42:29.900 --> 00:42:33.510
Getting to Nepal or Pakistan
is several thousand

00:42:33.510 --> 00:42:34.840
dollars to get there.

00:42:34.840 --> 00:42:40.850
But if you're trekking around
and living in Sherpa villages,

00:42:40.850 --> 00:42:43.790
the power of the dollar
goes really far.

00:42:43.790 --> 00:42:47.080
And so you can--

00:42:47.080 --> 00:42:49.390
I mean it's actually not that
expensive to do the research

00:42:49.390 --> 00:42:50.760
once you're there.

00:42:50.760 --> 00:42:54.110
The hard part is, I would do the
research and then I would

00:42:54.110 --> 00:42:56.870
realize, oh, I should
have done XYZ.

00:42:56.870 --> 00:42:57.820
Now I realize this.

00:42:57.820 --> 00:42:59.510
I need to go back
and getting back

00:42:59.510 --> 00:43:01.105
there is really expensive.

00:43:04.670 --> 00:43:06.940
For the initial research, we
paid for it ourselves.

00:43:06.940 --> 00:43:10.330
And then we just slept on
people's couches and used

00:43:10.330 --> 00:43:16.310
frequent flier miles and
were living in tents.

00:43:16.310 --> 00:43:19.760
And then later on, the
book proposal could

00:43:19.760 --> 00:43:22.140
help pay for it--

00:43:22.140 --> 00:43:23.760
the advance from the
book proposal.

00:43:23.760 --> 00:43:27.240
So that's kind of how it
worked financially.

00:43:27.240 --> 00:43:32.470
Oh, and the Sherpas get paid
several thousand dollars.

00:43:32.470 --> 00:43:41.550
It's maybe $3,000, depending on
how experienced they are, I

00:43:41.550 --> 00:43:42.740
would say maybe the
range would be

00:43:42.740 --> 00:43:46.390
maybe $1,000 to $5,000.

00:43:46.390 --> 00:43:48.520
And there's sort of two
different types of the high

00:43:48.520 --> 00:43:51.390
altitude workers, who get paid
a lot more than the low

00:43:51.390 --> 00:43:54.390
altitude workers who carry
stuff to base camp.

00:43:54.390 --> 00:43:56.020
They don't really get
paid much at all.

00:43:56.020 --> 00:43:59.020
The high altitude workers who
can be really skilled, they

00:43:59.020 --> 00:44:00.865
can get paid significantly
more.

00:44:00.865 --> 00:44:02.020
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:44:02.020 --> 00:44:02.750
PETER ZUCKERMAN: What's that?

00:44:02.750 --> 00:44:03.910
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:44:03.910 --> 00:44:04.710
PETER ZUCKERMAN: Oh,
that's per Sherpa.

00:44:04.710 --> 00:44:05.880
That's how much each individual

00:44:05.880 --> 00:44:07.380
Sherpa will take in.

00:44:07.380 --> 00:44:08.630
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:44:12.550 --> 00:44:15.710
PETER ZUCKERMAN: Yeah, I would
say over the whole expedition.

00:44:15.710 --> 00:44:17.560
I mean it also depends on
how long the expedition

00:44:17.560 --> 00:44:18.320
is going to go for.

00:44:18.320 --> 00:44:21.110
If you happen to get lucky and
everybody's acclimatize and

00:44:21.110 --> 00:44:23.300
the weather window is right when
you arrive, it's probably

00:44:23.300 --> 00:44:25.850
going to be significantly
cheaper.

00:44:25.850 --> 00:44:27.970
Because you won't have to
have as much supplies

00:44:27.970 --> 00:44:30.590
being ferried in.

00:44:30.590 --> 00:44:33.010
AUDIENCE: Recently there was
that altercation between the

00:44:33.010 --> 00:44:35.210
Sherpas and the Western
climbers.

00:44:35.210 --> 00:44:38.460
And I was wondering if you felt
that your book empowered

00:44:38.460 --> 00:44:40.590
the Sherpas?

00:44:40.590 --> 00:44:45.310
And if many of the Sherpas
know about your book?

00:44:45.310 --> 00:44:47.280
PETER ZUCKERMAN: I would say
we've made a big effort to let

00:44:47.280 --> 00:44:48.730
the Sherpas know
about the book.

00:44:48.730 --> 00:44:51.560
And the Sherpas have really
liked the book.

00:44:51.560 --> 00:44:56.360
They're really happy that their
story has been told.

00:44:56.360 --> 00:45:02.300
Most Sherpas who are in
climbing are not as--

00:45:02.300 --> 00:45:03.320
I don't want to say most.

00:45:03.320 --> 00:45:06.700
But a lot of them, I'll
say, are illiterate.

00:45:06.700 --> 00:45:12.490
And we went through the book
page by page with the major

00:45:12.490 --> 00:45:15.840
characters who are not
fantastic readers.

00:45:15.840 --> 00:45:22.080
But I don't know how much the
Sherpas know about the details

00:45:22.080 --> 00:45:23.980
of the book.

00:45:23.980 --> 00:45:26.080
But I hope they do.

00:45:26.080 --> 00:45:28.690
The fight on Everest--

00:45:28.690 --> 00:45:32.680
so there was literally a high
altitude brawl, supposedly, up

00:45:32.680 --> 00:45:38.710
on camp three on Everest
recently.

00:45:38.710 --> 00:45:41.370
And I don't really know what
to think about that.

00:45:41.370 --> 00:45:43.090
I mean, part of me--

00:45:43.090 --> 00:45:46.270
the Western climbers were well
respected climbers who knew

00:45:46.270 --> 00:45:50.550
what they were doing
and have done a lot

00:45:50.550 --> 00:45:52.650
for the Sherpas before.

00:45:52.650 --> 00:45:56.100
They continued up when the
Sherpas had told them not to.

00:45:56.100 --> 00:45:58.120
But they were on a separate
team and were competent

00:45:58.120 --> 00:46:00.910
enough, probably, to keep
climbing on their own.

00:46:00.910 --> 00:46:04.060
On the other hand, I've not seen
many detailed interviews

00:46:04.060 --> 00:46:06.010
with the Sherpas.

00:46:06.010 --> 00:46:07.890
And I haven't interviewed
the Sherpas.

00:46:07.890 --> 00:46:12.070
And so I feel like half the
story has not been told yet.

00:46:12.070 --> 00:46:14.080
So it's really hard to--

00:46:14.080 --> 00:46:16.110
So based on the facts that have
come out, I feel like the

00:46:16.110 --> 00:46:17.990
Westerners look really good.

00:46:17.990 --> 00:46:22.390
But those facts have mostly
come from the Westerners.

00:46:22.390 --> 00:46:26.460
So most of the people
there are still at

00:46:26.460 --> 00:46:27.290
Everest base camp.

00:46:27.290 --> 00:46:30.160
It's hard to get interviews
there unless you go to Nepal

00:46:30.160 --> 00:46:33.210
or people really want to spend
a lot of money on a sat phone

00:46:33.210 --> 00:46:36.520
to tell the story
of the Sherpas.

00:46:36.520 --> 00:46:38.750
So I think is going to be a
while until the facts shake

00:46:38.750 --> 00:46:40.870
out on that.

00:46:40.870 --> 00:46:46.010
And then I don't really
know where to blame.

00:46:46.010 --> 00:46:50.720
But it's a tough situation.

00:46:50.720 --> 00:46:52.570
AUDIENCE: Hi, thanks
for coming.

00:46:52.570 --> 00:46:55.260
You mentioned in story
about the naming.

00:46:55.260 --> 00:46:58.410
And then you said that the
language and culture are

00:46:58.410 --> 00:46:59.200
disappearing.

00:46:59.200 --> 00:47:02.010
So I was curious if you could
tell a couple more interesting

00:47:02.010 --> 00:47:04.400
things you found
in the culture?

00:47:04.400 --> 00:47:07.390
And what's happening to it.

00:47:07.390 --> 00:47:08.640
PETER ZUCKERMAN: Absolutely.

00:47:10.430 --> 00:47:13.780
A few really interesting
things--

00:47:13.780 --> 00:47:15.540
one, there was--

00:47:15.540 --> 00:47:20.810
at a lot of the villages I went
to the elders there told

00:47:20.810 --> 00:47:24.050
me, this is where the
world started.

00:47:24.050 --> 00:47:25.750
This is the beginning of life.

00:47:25.750 --> 00:47:27.930
The beginning of life
was at Rolwaling,

00:47:27.930 --> 00:47:29.800
right here at Beding.

00:47:29.800 --> 00:47:33.410
And everybody who leaves
is going to die.

00:47:33.410 --> 00:47:36.100
And, actually, you need to move
here because you seem

00:47:36.100 --> 00:47:37.430
like a good person.

00:47:37.430 --> 00:47:42.570
And you need to get all of our
children to move here, because

00:47:42.570 --> 00:47:44.600
they're leaving and they're
going to be killed along with

00:47:44.600 --> 00:47:46.430
everybody else.

00:47:46.430 --> 00:47:50.710
And then the young people
say that story is

00:47:50.710 --> 00:47:51.790
completely made up.

00:47:51.790 --> 00:47:54.940
They just tell that to
entertain Westerners.

00:47:54.940 --> 00:48:01.770
And the dismiss us, because
everybody's leaving these

00:48:01.770 --> 00:48:05.050
villages and the festivals are
going away and things just

00:48:05.050 --> 00:48:07.980
aren't what they used to be.

00:48:07.980 --> 00:48:09.740
So I talked to anthropologists
about this.

00:48:09.740 --> 00:48:11.000
And said, well what's
the real story?

00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:13.940
They didn't know either.

00:48:13.940 --> 00:48:15.620
But it's a really sad.

00:48:15.620 --> 00:48:19.950
The village that Chhiring grew
up in used to have several

00:48:19.950 --> 00:48:21.480
hundred people.

00:48:21.480 --> 00:48:24.720
And when I went there
was just 23 people.

00:48:24.720 --> 00:48:27.090
And they were all really old.

00:48:27.090 --> 00:48:30.850
And the young people are all
moving to Kathmandu, the city

00:48:30.850 --> 00:48:35.670
in Nepal, to take jobs
in mountaineering.

00:48:35.670 --> 00:48:40.330
In Pakistan I felt like the
villages were much more--

00:48:40.330 --> 00:48:43.010
the villages I went to, they
had a lot more going on and

00:48:43.010 --> 00:48:45.600
they still retained a lot
more of the culture.

00:48:45.600 --> 00:48:51.350
But in some ways were also going
through that transition

00:48:51.350 --> 00:48:55.240
to more people leaving the city
to the Western world.

00:48:55.240 --> 00:48:58.340
And I feel like one of the
things I learned from this

00:48:58.340 --> 00:49:02.965
project is, on the one hand,
it's easy to characterize.

00:49:07.060 --> 00:49:11.490
I come home and I think, gosh,
I live so comfortably.

00:49:11.490 --> 00:49:13.720
I'm not going to die of
a contagious disease.

00:49:13.720 --> 00:49:18.870
Life is really pretty good for
me and I really have so much.

00:49:18.870 --> 00:49:22.670
And I saw how comfortable
my life is.

00:49:22.670 --> 00:49:23.580
And then on the other
hand, I thought,

00:49:23.580 --> 00:49:24.800
gosh, I have so little.

00:49:24.800 --> 00:49:26.960
If I lived in a village I
would know who all my

00:49:26.960 --> 00:49:27.920
neighbors were.

00:49:27.920 --> 00:49:31.620
And I'd spend a lot more time
drinking tea, and playing

00:49:31.620 --> 00:49:36.510
games, and really caring
about my community.

00:49:36.510 --> 00:49:42.730
And so I can see how
globalization or whatever you

00:49:42.730 --> 00:49:47.790
want to call it is isolating
us as it makes us more

00:49:47.790 --> 00:49:48.300
comfortable.

00:49:48.300 --> 00:49:51.180
And that's certainly happening
in the villages in a very

00:49:51.180 --> 00:49:52.430
dramatic way.

00:49:55.420 --> 00:49:58.070
AUDIENCE: So in your
presentation here you talk a

00:49:58.070 --> 00:50:03.570
lot about the lessons that go
beyond just this story and

00:50:03.570 --> 00:50:05.600
looking outside life.

00:50:05.600 --> 00:50:08.200
Is that also themes that
are addressed in

00:50:08.200 --> 00:50:10.780
the book itself too?

00:50:10.780 --> 00:50:11.320
PETER ZUCKERMAN: A little bit.

00:50:11.320 --> 00:50:14.750
I try not to talk too much
about myself in the book.

00:50:14.750 --> 00:50:19.360
Because I feel like I learned
all these lessons, but here

00:50:19.360 --> 00:50:21.110
people who were dying.

00:50:21.110 --> 00:50:22.240
And here are--

00:50:22.240 --> 00:50:25.540
I felt like, oh gosh, I had
some crazy adventures.

00:50:25.540 --> 00:50:31.450
Like as was mentioned here, long
story, but I overdosed on

00:50:31.450 --> 00:50:33.410
a worm with shrooms
growing out of its

00:50:33.410 --> 00:50:34.990
head for karma purposes.

00:50:34.990 --> 00:50:37.510
And had to be evacuated
on a helicopter.

00:50:37.510 --> 00:50:40.980
And it was very scary and
life-changing and strange.

00:50:40.980 --> 00:50:46.050
And we are all declared dead and
it was a crazy adventure.

00:50:46.050 --> 00:50:49.490
But I feel like that was a
crazy adventure for me.

00:50:49.490 --> 00:50:54.990
But the lessons are
more for the--

00:50:54.990 --> 00:51:01.720
the climbers had a much more
life and death experience than

00:51:01.720 --> 00:51:05.310
I ever did and are much more
courageous people that I was.

00:51:05.310 --> 00:51:08.300
I wasn't climbing K2.

00:51:08.300 --> 00:51:11.360
That said, and I try to be too
judgmental of them because

00:51:11.360 --> 00:51:16.150
it's hard to judge people at
their worst moments when

00:51:16.150 --> 00:51:17.950
they're oxygen deprived--

00:51:17.950 --> 00:51:21.260
but that said, I tried very
clearly make sure the facts

00:51:21.260 --> 00:51:22.060
are in place.

00:51:22.060 --> 00:51:25.670
So that somebody reading this
can say, oh, that's how I

00:51:25.670 --> 00:51:27.800
think about this situation
and can draw those

00:51:27.800 --> 00:51:30.290
lessons from it.

00:51:30.290 --> 00:51:34.870
Because I felt like there
are lessons, it's just--

00:51:34.870 --> 00:51:38.890
it's hard for me to come up with
a real universal lesson

00:51:38.890 --> 00:51:41.030
except, which I feel like is a
really important universal

00:51:41.030 --> 00:51:44.520
lesson, is Sherpas are
all around us.

00:51:44.520 --> 00:51:46.510
There are Sherpas
in every story.

00:51:46.510 --> 00:51:48.900
And you need to know about the
people you're working with

00:51:48.900 --> 00:51:53.260
because you depend on them
whether you're trying to climb

00:51:53.260 --> 00:51:56.540
up your own mountain, whether
you're climbing up K2.

00:51:56.540 --> 00:51:59.730
And I feel like the fundamental
lesson I learned

00:51:59.730 --> 00:52:03.910
from this was that it's sort of
a teamwork lesson, which is

00:52:03.910 --> 00:52:06.560
know the members of your team.

00:52:06.560 --> 00:52:09.710
And that that was something
that more

00:52:09.710 --> 00:52:12.400
mountaineers could do.

00:52:12.400 --> 00:52:13.050
CHRIS DEFAY: Thank you, Peter.

00:52:13.050 --> 00:52:14.190
PETER ZUCKERMAN: Well
thank you very much.

00:52:14.190 --> 00:52:14.980
This was fun.

00:52:14.980 --> 00:52:19.180
[APPLAUSE]
