00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.180
Teens are often characterized as angsty, impulsive, socially inept citizens without fully formed brains,

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:08.040
straddling the worlds of being a child and 
an adult, but how much of that is true?

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.060
More after this break.

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:11.520
You got a theme song?

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:15.220
Roll it!

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:17.220
That was the theme song?

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:18.320
Someone's getting fired.

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:20.440
Adolescence, the end of the 
beginning of our lives,

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:22.699
or the beginning of the beginning
of the end of our lives.

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:26.089
Sorry, I was raised on My Chemical Romance. I've got a lot of, like, dark thoughts in my head.

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:30.230
Back in 3, 2...Adolescent development is
categorized by the onset of puberty and ends

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:32.220
when we choose our adult identity and behavior.

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:36.100
The ages that this occurs has changed over
time; people used to think it was 10-19 years old,

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.030
but new research suggests that the upper
limit is actually 24.

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:39.800
Why the change?

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.420
Well our bodies are still changing into our
20s and our brains don’t fully develop

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:44.539
also into our mid 20s.

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:46.540
But what does it even mean to be an adult?

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:47.520
Being emotionally sound?

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:48.640
Making good decisions?

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:49.930
A 9:30 bedtime?

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:53.940
Well, here are the Teens Are Dummies greatest
hits: “Teens Can’t Make Decisions,”

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.969
“Teens Are Impulsive,” and “They
Don’t Know Real Hip-Hop.”

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.140
None of those songs slap, but let’s break
them down.

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:01.140
“They Can’t Make Decisions” is the one
we all hear.

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.120
Got a lot of radio play earlier this year.

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.700
After the rise in student activism after school
shootings, people derided the kids saying

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.500
that they couldn’t make decisions that young.

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:11.770
But while the prefrontal cortex, the part
of the brain responsible for abstract thoughts,

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:16.001
decision-making, and social behaviors, isn’t
fully developed by high school age, it doesn’t

00:01:16.001 --> 00:01:19.330
mean that kids aren’t ready to make decisions
about whether they want to live or not.

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:21.020
That’s survival instinct, we all have that.

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:23.660
And in this case it's tied directly
to traumatic emotions and memories, which

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:26.760
encompasses the limbic system,
the hippocampus, and, ding-dong, the prefrontal

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:30.140
cortex.Yeah, there are some decisions that
kids can’t make like whether or not to buy a certified

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:32.560
pre-owned hatchback, I mean, 
you can't do it by yourself.

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:33.600
You got to get a guarantor on that.

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.840
But survival is something that people
of all ages can make decisions on.

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.820
Especially if it’s to stop future trauma
based on past ones. 16 year olds can see school

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:43.460
shooters in their school and be like, “yeah,
I don’t want that to happen again.”

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:47.840
They’re brains are formed enough make choices about wanting doctors, or breathable air,

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.140
or polar bears.

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.980
Man, I miss polar bears.

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:54.750
Older people’s main reservations about 16 year
olds voting surround their decision making,

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.110
whether they’re emotionally impulsive, and
that they don’t know how this country really

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.430
works...but, as we see, research suggests
otherwise.

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:06.300
At age 16, adolescent brains are still developing,
whereas older brains are begin cognitive decline

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:11.000
as early as age 45...soooo should there be
an age cap on voting?

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.910
Older people vote on issues that affect youth
currently who have much less power over the

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:16.220
future that they will have to live in....
just a thought.

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:17.000
And I get it,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.831
The sentence “47th President of the United
States Danielle Bregoli” terrifies me, but

00:02:20.831 --> 00:02:24.190
evidence shows that teens are getting smarter,
more active, and are energized.

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:27.700
And the science says that not only are we
ready to make those decisions, 16 could be

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:32.300
a better age to start forming civic engagement
and socially responsible habits as well.

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:34.890
“Teens Are Impulsive” is kinda reductive.

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.620
Yes, research suggests that younger people take
higher risks, are more impulsive, and their

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:39.819
limbic systems aren’t fully developed.

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:42.680
But this is because their social learning
is still being calibrated.

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:46.840
Adolescents tend to be bad at reading the emotions of others, but it takes time to learn how to

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:51.460
read all the complex social cues. And given the news
these days, it sounds like a lot of adults

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:52.960
run into those issues as well.

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:56.820
Studies show that by age 15, cold cognition,
or decision making based on facts rather than

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:58.380
emotions, is almost fully developed.

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:03.140
So, it’s possible that adolescents voting
at 18 is a-ok, possibly younger.

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:06.900
Millenials are eclipsing Baby Boomers as a
significant bloc in America’s electorate,

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:11.040
Generation Z is beginning to get the right to vote,
and if current social movements are any indication,

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:12.120
change is on the way.

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:15.280
With access to information, research suggesting
that they can be sound decision makers, and

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:19.300
the drive to make significant, impactful change,
I, for one, the first person in history

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:20.920
to ever have said this. No one else has said this.

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:23.700
Say that “the kids are alright.”

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.700
Trademark.

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:29.860
Here at Seeker, we share stories about science, technology, engineering and mathematics.

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:32.680
So make sure you come back
and watch more videos, see.

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:34.020
Thanks for watching.
