00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.299
the Nobel laureate and I'm also excited
to talk to you a little bit about the

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309
to talk to you a little bit about the
 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:13.879
to talk to you a little bit about the
future of intelligence from the lens of

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889
future of intelligence from the lens of
 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.300

before you today I'm reminded of the

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480
before you today I'm reminded of the
 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.240
before you today I'm reminded of the
first serious computer program I wrote

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250
first serious computer program I wrote
 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.150
first serious computer program I wrote
back in the mid-80s it was what we call

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160
back in the mid-80s it was what we call
 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.670
back in the mid-80s it was what we call
an expert system it was to help my dad

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680
an expert system it was to help my dad
 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.020
an expert system it was to help my dad
who was a judge in India to solve

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:38.030
who was a judge in India to solve
 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:43.010

automotive compensation cases I remember

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020
automotive compensation cases I remember
 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.470
automotive compensation cases I remember
that day vividly because we demonstrated

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480
that day vividly because we demonstrated
 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.779
that day vividly because we demonstrated
it to a colleague of my dad who went on

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789
it to a colleague of my dad who went on
 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.010
it to a colleague of my dad who went on
to become the supreme court chief

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020
to become the supreme court chief
 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.600
to become the supreme court chief
justice in India back then we imagined

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610
justice in India back then we imagined
 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.740
justice in India back then we imagined
and we dreamt that expertise could be

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750
and we dreamt that expertise could be
 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.160
and we dreamt that expertise could be
captured in computing systems but we

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170
captured in computing systems but we
 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.470
captured in computing systems but we
very quickly ran into a lot of

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480
very quickly ran into a lot of
 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.410
very quickly ran into a lot of
limitations these systems were fragile

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420
limitations these systems were fragile
 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.460
limitations these systems were fragile
they were not very usable and we could

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470
they were not very usable and we could
 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.890
they were not very usable and we could
not actually achieve those goals back

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900
not actually achieve those goals back
 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.210
not actually achieve those goals back
then but today we have so much data we

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220
then but today we have so much data we
 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.640
then but today we have so much data we
have so many new technologies we have so

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650
have so many new technologies we have so
 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.020
have so many new technologies we have so
much computing infrastructure that we

much computing infrastructure that we
 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.550
much computing infrastructure that we
can make those dreams come to come true

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560
can make those dreams come to come true
 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.890
can make those dreams come to come true
I think we've reached a point where the

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900
I think we've reached a point where the
 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.990
I think we've reached a point where the
nature of expertise itself can be
