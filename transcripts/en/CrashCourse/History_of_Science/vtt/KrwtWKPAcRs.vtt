00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:10.280
We’ve explored the origins of modern biology,
the earth sciences, and even the sciences

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:11.719
of outer space.

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:14.590
Now it’s time to put these disciplines together.

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:19.820
Starting around 1900—but picking up during
the Cold War—scientists looked beyond individual

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:25.710
species and ask questions about how whole
systems of living and nonliving things change

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.050
together over time.

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:33.160
Where geneticists looked to model evolution
in the laboratory, these nature-focused, systems-thinking

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:40.020
scientists looked to bring laboratory-style
research—meaning reproducible and empirical—into

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.460
the literal field.

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.200
It’s the birth of ecology and earth systems
science!

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:54.680
[Intro Music Plays]

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.340
As with other “modern” disciplines, ecology

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:02.010
has lots of roots in different places and
times, but it became a formal science in the

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.360
late 1800s and early 1900s.

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:09.820
The detailed, wide-ranging, and data-driven
work of Darwin, Wallace and others inspired

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:14.710
other life science researchers to travel and
observe the complexities of the living world.

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:18.170
And Darwin’s German hype-man, biologist
Ernst Haeckel, coined the

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:24.179
word ecology, This means the study of the
oikos, meaning home—or, metaphorically,

00:01:24.179 --> 00:01:25.179
the environment.

00:01:25.179 --> 00:01:29.520
Haeckel introduced popular readers to many
environments in his masterwork of scientific

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.140
illustration, Art Forms in Nature.

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:36.149
But okay—what exactly would doing a science
of the environment look like?

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:41.620
It would involve studying life and the nonliving
things that affect life like water and soil.

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:46.810
Mediating between living and nonliving things
are nutrients like carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen,

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:49.649
which cycle in and out of organisms in different
ways.

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:54.729
So early ecologists tended to include both
life scientists like Haeckel and earth scientists;

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:59.170
as well as those studying evolution, like
geneticists working on flies, and those studying

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:01.079
landscapes, like botanists.

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:05.459
Botanical gardens remained key places to conduct
research, as did natural history museums that

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:09.630
collected bones, fossils, and preserved specimens
in jars.

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:13.440
Bones could be compared to bones, leaves to
leaves, and so on.

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:18.400
Mexican-American Ynes Mexia started fieldwork
at the age of fifty one… and went on to

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:25.210
collect more than 150,000 wild botanical specimens,
at least five hundred of which were new species.

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:27.200
And her work is still being processed!

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.460
Meanwhile, Russian-Ukrainian polymath Vladimir
Vernadsky pioneered ways

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:33.770
to analyze nature holistically.

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:39.300
One was geochemistry, or using the methods
of chemistry to understand minerals.

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:44.200
Another was biogeochemistry, which analyzes
living and nonliving processes.

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:49.280
Vernadsky promoted a new mode of ecological
thought: what is life?

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:54.340
At the highest level of analysis, it’s the
whole observable-by-humans planet!

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:58.710
The nonliving, or abiotic, dimension of the
earth is the geosphere, which cradles and

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:00.820
interacts with the biosphere.

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:05.540
Vernadsky even proposed another level: the
noösphere, or totality

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:10.890
of human thought, which he imagined cradled
by and interacting with the lower levels.

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:17.250
Vernadsky also pioneered radiogeology, the
study of radioactive elements in the crust.

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:20.030
Aaand he worked on the Soviets’ atomic bomb.

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:23.100
Because sooooo many scientists worked on weapons.

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:25.140
Around the time that Vernadsky worked, ecology

00:03:25.151 --> 00:03:27.140
became a discipline.

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:32.610
English botanist Arthur Tansley first obsessed
over ferns, and later all plants.

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:36.840
He wanted to map all of the different types
of vegetation across England, and he thought

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.000
other botanists should want the same.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.440
So he founded clubs to map plant types.

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:47.670
And in 1913, Tansley organized the first professional
society of ecologists, and he became the first

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:50.190
editor of the Journal of Ecology.

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:55.490
In terms of epistemic work, Tansley is remembered
for one word: ecosystem.

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:58.330
See, scientists are pretty into units.

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:03.740
Tansley reframed the study of nature: instead
of groups of individual living things—say,

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:08.660
some birds in some trees—it’s the study
of dynamic interactions between living and

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:10.850
nonliving things in one area.

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:14.140
Tansley’s rival was American botanist Frederic
Clements.

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:18.810
His epistemic contributions similarly involved
what ecologists should study.

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:22.879
Clements argued that plant formations are
best studied as units called communities.

00:04:22.879 --> 00:04:27.460
A plant community is not just like a living
organism: it is an organism!

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:30.379
It’s born, grows, eats, and dies.

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:34.240
And Clements focused on how an area’s climate
determined which plants will grow there.

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:39.320
For example, a pond dries up over and becomes
first a meadow, then a forest.

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:44.870
This was a version of an older concept, ecological
succession, how the makeup of groups of organisms

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:46.639
in areas change over time.

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:52.319
But Clements championed his own, highly deterministic
“climax community” version of succession.

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:57.440
Tansley haaated this, arguing that nature
is messier than Clements described in his work.

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:02.120
Tansley and Clements fought about ecology
from 1905 until World War Two.

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:07.469
But both agreed that ecologists should promote
conservation, or working to actively maintain

00:05:07.469 --> 00:05:10.360
the health of nonhuman environments.

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:11.620
Conservation has its own history.

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:16.949
But ecology as a way of making knowledge has
always been tied to conservation as an ethos

00:05:16.949 --> 00:05:20.180
or practice—a way of doing something in
the world.

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:24.289
This isn’t a “technology” in the same
way the lightbulb or computer is.

00:05:24.289 --> 00:05:30.039
But the practice of conserving ecosystems
is as important as lighting up cities or making

00:05:30.039 --> 00:05:31.159
sicc memes.

00:05:31.159 --> 00:05:35.319
To name just two wins in conservation, U.S.
President Teddy Roosevelt created the National

00:05:35.319 --> 00:05:41.270
Park system in the first decade of the 1900s,
helping preserve vast areas of forest, desert,

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:42.270
and other wilderness.

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:46.849
And in 1972, the Marine Mammal Protection
Act helped radically lessen the threat humans

00:05:46.849 --> 00:05:51.389
present to dolphins, seals, and whales in
U.S. waters—although the threat remains.

00:05:51.389 --> 00:05:54.090
But early ecologists didn’t have all the

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:55.289
tools they needed.

00:05:55.289 --> 00:06:00.540
For many of those, we can thank English-American
polymath George Evelyn Hutchinson, his student,

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:04.650
Howard T. Odum, and Howard’s older brother,
Eugene.

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:08.659
Take us there, Thoughtbubble!
After World War Two, they established ecosystem

00:06:08.659 --> 00:06:12.309
ecology as a richly quantitative discipline.

00:06:12.309 --> 00:06:17.500
They took Tansley’s essential insight and
ran with it, showing how to model the processes

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:19.360
at work in a given ecosystem.

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:24.749
All three men used experiments to generate
mathematical models tracing the flow of energy

00:06:24.749 --> 00:06:30.990
from nonliving sources, into primary producers
like plants, primary consumers like herbivores,

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:34.300
and then into meat eaters and the eaters of
dead things—fungi and bacteria.

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:40.900
And he was the first to use very small amounts
of radioactive particles as tracers to map

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:45.699
how particles move in a pond, including how
plants take up radiation.

00:06:45.699 --> 00:06:51.279
The Odums went on to develop this radiotracer-as-tool
technique further, which is used today to

00:06:51.279 --> 00:06:54.990
study how water moves and how pollutants move
through environments.

00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:59.909
They also helped establish radiation ecology,
which studies the effects of radioactive materials

00:06:59.909 --> 00:07:01.110
on living systems.

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:05.720
The Odums researched ecosystems from coral
reefs in the Pacific to riversheds in Georgia.

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:10.349
Eugene Odum taught at the University of Georgia,
in fact, from 1940 to 2002.

00:07:10.349 --> 00:07:15.499
He pushed all biology students to study ecology—which
got a big laugh in the forties, but is now

00:07:15.499 --> 00:07:18.090
part of the common sense of the life sciences.

00:07:18.090 --> 00:07:22.050
Of course you have to study how weather, plants,
animals, and soils relate!

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:26.479
And Eugene deftly summarized, with some help
from his bro, much of their work in the book

00:07:26.479 --> 00:07:29.650
Fundamentals in Ecology in 1953.

00:07:29.650 --> 00:07:34.729
This book unified ecology, offering a range
of useful techniques to all budding plant

00:07:34.729 --> 00:07:37.719
scientists, animal scientists, and rock scientists.

00:07:37.719 --> 00:07:40.940
For years, it was the only textbook in ecology.

00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:44.690
And, revised, it’s still used as a textbook
in many classes today!

00:07:44.690 --> 00:07:47.999
Thanks ThoughtBubble!
The Odums’ work encompassed observational

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.960
and empirical methods, some of which were
focused on specific parts of ecosystems.

00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:57.440
But the Odums were also pioneers of a sub-discipline of ecosystem ecology,

00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:00.759
confusingly called systems ecology.

00:08:00.759 --> 00:08:06.779
This is the holistic study of complex living
systems as systems—including the interactions

00:08:06.779 --> 00:08:11.729
among their nonliving inputs, their boundaries,
how they adapt to new conditions, how they

00:08:11.729 --> 00:08:17.150
interact with other systems, and the unpredictable,
emergent properties they exhibit.

00:08:17.150 --> 00:08:21.900
Inspired by Hutchinson’s work on feedback
loops, Howard modeled how energy flows within

00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:22.900
ecosystems.

00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:27.909
He borrowed concepts from thermodynamics and
computing in his work on systems ecology.

00:08:27.909 --> 00:08:34.219
You could say the Odums were trying to understand
ecosystems as really complex, but not random,

00:08:34.219 --> 00:08:35.219
machines.

00:08:35.219 --> 00:08:41.479
In fact, in the 1960s, they applied multiple
times for money from NASA to engineer self-regulating,

00:08:41.479 --> 00:08:47.240
closed ecosystems of algae and plankton—a
whole biosphere in miniature.

00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:49.720
These would serve as life-support systems
for astronauts.

00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:54.240
They based their proposals on their study
of the energy flows of the coral atoll Enewetak

00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:56.050
in the Marshall Islands.

00:08:56.050 --> 00:09:01.140
Alas, NASA thought their plans were too complex,
and the Odums returned to earthly matters.

00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:03.870
The question of life in space intrigued scientists

00:09:03.870 --> 00:09:07.199
modeling the relationships between energy,
chemicals, and organisms.

00:09:07.199 --> 00:09:12.670
In the 1960s, NASA hired English scientist
James Lovelock to build instruments to analyze

00:09:12.670 --> 00:09:15.889
the atmosphere of Mars—and look for signs
of life.

00:09:15.889 --> 00:09:20.959
Lovelock thought about why Mars’ atmosphere
has certain properties, different from ours,

00:09:20.959 --> 00:09:23.370
and what that means for the evolution of life.

00:09:23.370 --> 00:09:27.930
He arrived at the Gaia Hypothesis, named after
the Greek earth goddess.

00:09:27.930 --> 00:09:34.260
This says the earth’s biogeosphere is self-regulating,
within broad limits: living things, air, rocks,

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:39.490
and water interact in complex ways so that
living things can stick around.

00:09:39.490 --> 00:09:42.279
This was a hugely controversial claim!

00:09:42.279 --> 00:09:45.380
It suggested a self-awareness to the earth.

00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:49.970
But Lovelock’s evidence for a regulatory
function between what’s in the atmosphere

00:09:49.970 --> 00:09:55.370
and oceans and what’s alive, breathing that
air or water, is pretty convincing.

00:09:55.370 --> 00:09:59.540
And he picked up major support from revolutionary
biologist Lynn Margulis.

00:09:59.540 --> 00:10:02.350
She discovered that some of the tiny organs
inside cells—like cells’ power stations,

00:10:02.350 --> 00:10:07.560
mitochondria and chloroplasts—used to be
free-floating bacteria that evolved to live

00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:09.870
entirely within larger organisms.

00:10:09.870 --> 00:10:16.370
This idea, endosymbiosis, was also huge controversial—not
because it was too touchy-feely, but because

00:10:16.370 --> 00:10:19.790
it seemed to have nothing to do with the work
of Darwin!

00:10:19.790 --> 00:10:22.620
But Margulis also demonstrated lots of evidence.

00:10:22.620 --> 00:10:27.400
So biologists and ecologists were confronted
with complex systems over here,

00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:32.780
superorganisms over there— communitiesall the way up, and all the way down in scale.

00:10:32.790 --> 00:10:36.940
Today, this shift is captured in the name
of the meta-discipline that applies systems

00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:41.339
thinking across many sciences: earth systems
science.

00:10:41.339 --> 00:10:47.310
This means understanding how living and nonliving
processes relate, and looking at the entire

00:10:47.310 --> 00:10:50.680
earth as one very big—but not infinite—house.

00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:54.110
This is a house we humans can wreck.

00:10:54.110 --> 00:10:55.510
And—we hope—repair.

00:10:55.510 --> 00:11:00.620
So just as the life sciences had to scale
up to ecosystems and then the entire earth,

00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:05.329
they also had to take into account how humans
affect ecosystems and earth systems.

00:11:05.329 --> 00:11:08.290
A new branch, human ecology, developed.

00:11:08.290 --> 00:11:12.750
If that all sounds a bit like what Vernadsky
said a hundred years ago—you’re right!

00:11:12.750 --> 00:11:17.370
Human thought, nonhuman life, rocks, water—all
connected.

00:11:17.370 --> 00:11:23.470
Or, as Eugene Odum wrote: “the landscape
is not just a supply depot but is also the

00:11:23.470 --> 00:11:26.360
oikos —the home—in which
we must live.”

00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:31.149
Next time—we’ll move from studying nature
to controlling it… and losing control.

00:11:31.149 --> 00:11:37.310
It’s time for the Green Revolution, pesticide
pollution, and the birth of environmentalism.

00:11:37.310 --> 00:11:40.899
Crash Course History of Science is filmed
in the Dr. Cheryl C. Kinney studio in Missoula,

00:11:40.899 --> 00:11:45.000
Montana and it’s made with the help of all
this nice people and our animation team is

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:46.000
Thought Cafe.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:47.660
Crash Course is a Complexly production.
