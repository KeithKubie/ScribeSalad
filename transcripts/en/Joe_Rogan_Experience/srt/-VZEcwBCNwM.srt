1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:04,450
Boom, boom, boom, boom. Brian, Moses,

2
00:00:04,451 --> 00:00:09,130
you are one of the saviors of comedy.
I want you to know this honestly truly,

3
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:10,630
really cause arose.

4
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:15,660
Battle Rose Battle is like one of the
last real like sanctuaries for horrible

5
00:00:18,671 --> 00:00:22,270
comedy, like nasty, evil,

6
00:00:22,271 --> 00:00:27,271
fucked up but hilarious comedy and the
way you do it where you make everybody

7
00:00:27,851 --> 00:00:31,660
hug it out at the end and you, you
know, and you like set the ground rules,

8
00:00:31,661 --> 00:00:35,110
no violence. This is just
joke riding. This is all,

9
00:00:35,111 --> 00:00:37,090
this is just boards don't hurt us.

10
00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:40,540
When I first came back to the comic
store was like how many years ago it was,

11
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:42,460
now it's like five years
ago or something like that.

12
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:46,660
Cause I was over and when I saw rose
bottle it was one of the things that made

13
00:00:46,661 --> 00:00:50,560
me go, Whoa, this place is
different now. This place is chain.

14
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:53,990
It's like it's evolved. We brought like
come like as some like would have a, a,

15
00:00:53,991 --> 00:00:56,260
a fight culture back to it.
You know what I mean? Yeah.

16
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,690
You know like where if you
have a problem, you know,

17
00:00:58,691 --> 00:01:02,140
we're in a place where all we use is
words. Anyway. So Duke it out that way.

18
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:04,340
Yeah. Well not just that, it,

19
00:01:04,490 --> 00:01:07,310
there's people that don't have problems
with each other and they just fucking

20
00:01:07,311 --> 00:01:08,650
each other up on that stage.

21
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:11,610
There's like people who like
devastated friendships. Yeah.

22
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,920
They've ruined friendships, but
nobody's ever attacked each other.

23
00:01:14,921 --> 00:01:18,910
So that's amazing. Cause I've been there
a couple of times, I stopped going.

24
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:23,410
It makes me feel bad. It does.
It's consensual. Everybody.

25
00:01:23,411 --> 00:01:25,120
Everybody's in blue. I fucking,

26
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:28,840
I'm the commentator for the UFC
and roast battle makes me feel bad.

27
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:31,240
That's the combat sport. You don't like.

28
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:34,090
Just stop and think about how
crazy that is. That's nuts. Why,

29
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:37,570
how was that possible? Sometimes it's
so mean. Sometimes people say, shit,

30
00:01:37,571 --> 00:01:41,650
that's so mean. You're like, yeah, I saw,
I saw there was a joke recently by a,

31
00:01:41,651 --> 00:01:45,490
it was Jimmy Carr and Megan Gailey
and Jimmy was judging her and she was

32
00:01:45,491 --> 00:01:47,650
battling a puppet. That's
how crazy this she'll get.

33
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:52,300
So this girl has got like a hacker on
comedy central. She's, she's brilliant.

34
00:01:52,330 --> 00:01:55,390
And uh, Jimmy said something
snide to her and her response was,

35
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:59,950
I wouldn't fuck you if you
raped me. That was like, that's,

36
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:03,430
I can't believe I've never heard that
before. And his response to that was, oh,

37
00:02:03,431 --> 00:02:07,000
you can say funny things.
Oh Wow. It was gorgeous.

38
00:02:07,001 --> 00:02:08,650
I wouldn't fuck you if you raped me.

39
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:15,140
Let's break that down. Yeah. I would
have to be like this, like, hmm. I don't,

40
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:17,740
I don't know if we're going
along with that false premise.

41
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:22,750
I'm not going along with that
one. Why not? I Dunno. I mean,

42
00:02:22,751 --> 00:02:25,140
you're not fucking someone if
they're rape, you know? No good.

43
00:02:25,141 --> 00:02:27,880
It's not consensual. Right. You're not
giving it back. Does that make sense?

44
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:33,160
All right. Yeah, I get what she's saying.

45
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:35,110
It's just so hard though.
It was like, damn,

46
00:02:35,111 --> 00:02:38,650
I wouldn't fuck you if you raped
me. God, that's just, that's hard.

47
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:40,880
And The lady said that to a man and oh,

48
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:43,570
it took him a couple of seconds and
be like, I'm going to let this happen.

49
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:47,470
There was some senators somewhere and
they were talking about rape and he

50
00:02:47,471 --> 00:02:51,040
actually said that a woman can't,

51
00:02:51,041 --> 00:02:55,600
unless she submits, he a
man can't actually rape her.

52
00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:57,720
Wait, what? Unless yeah, yeah, yeah.

53
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,960
Less she gives it unless she tabs
out like I'm giving it to you.

54
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:03,070
It was something along those lines,

55
00:03:03,071 --> 00:03:08,010
like it was almost like saying that she
kind of wants it. Wow. I remember that.

56
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:14,170
Yeah. There's, it was one of the most
ridiculous misspoke of course. Oh, he,

57
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:19,460
this book they made Mario
Lopez apologize for the babies.

58
00:03:19,601 --> 00:03:23,910
Shouldn't be trans. And
he said, I'm still, my,

59
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:27,770
my comments were ignorant and insensitive
cause I wanna keep my job at e. Right.

60
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:31,300
Exactly how it is. He should have
added that she should've went.dot, dot.

61
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:35,050
Because I want to keep my, cause I want
to keep my job. That's really all it is.

62
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:39,160
Three-Year-Old trans babies. What
the fuck? Some a Blair white,

63
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:42,970
who's actually a trans woman,
had a hilarious quote. She goes,

64
00:03:42,971 --> 00:03:46,180
a three year old trans
kids are like Vegan cats.

65
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:50,470
We know who's making the
lifestyle choices. Oh, message.

66
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:56,110
And she's trans. And she can
say that she's free. Free.

67
00:03:56,111 --> 00:03:57,550
Like a bird. I mean, what age?

68
00:03:58,550 --> 00:04:01,780
It ain't three should be in your 20s or
somebody should be in when you're like

69
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:05,310
an adult adults. A full grown adult.
Right. Three-Year-Olds. What's the matter?

70
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:09,670
Camera camera cut off. What?
The fucking government.

71
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:11,530
They don't want us talking
about trans babies.

72
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:17,770
Dead to camera tie. The court died.

73
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:24,460
Yeah. Oh, hi everybody. Um, yeah.

74
00:04:24,461 --> 00:04:27,760
I mean we live in the weirdest time
in terms of like progressive ideology,

75
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:32,560
B dogma. Gender is a construct race as a
construct. Trying to bring it all down,

76
00:04:32,561 --> 00:04:36,670
but race is not a construct because no
one's been successfully trans racial. Oh,

77
00:04:36,671 --> 00:04:39,610
that's true. Never. Never been
pulled off. Even remotely.

78
00:04:39,611 --> 00:04:42,490
Not even 90 Murphy on SNL. Yeah,

79
00:04:42,491 --> 00:04:45,730
but you could go back to white like
Dave Chappelle. Just do it all the time.

80
00:04:45,731 --> 00:04:50,390
Remember he used to do the
wall the crazy way. Yeah.

81
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:53,120
That was really good too. You could,

82
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:55,420
you could do black to
white and nobody cares.

83
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:58,840
You used to be able to white to
Asian. You can't even do that anymore.

84
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:02,860
[inaudible] transracial you could
probably go Asian to white people really

85
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:07,080
holding onto this race thing. Why
is that? Why do we hold on to it?

86
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:10,990
I don't know. I don't know. I don't
know. That makes, I don't look at you.

87
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,730
It was like, I don't even know.
I don't even know what you are.

88
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:18,280
You're just a tank. You know what I
mean? I'm, I'm mostly Italian, Irish,

89
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:22,630
1% Asian, 1.6% African.
See, I don't even have that.

90
00:05:22,631 --> 00:05:25,420
I'm just like a N***a from
America. You know what I mean?

91
00:05:25,421 --> 00:05:29,890
Like I'm just American black.
Well, it's, if you care,

92
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:32,140
if you cared that I might
look variety's interesting.

93
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:35,560
I liked that people look cool. Like
we were talking about Blake Griffin.

94
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:39,850
Like it's interesting that there's a guy
like him out there, big old giant dude,

95
00:05:39,851 --> 00:05:41,450
six foot 10 albino look,

96
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:43,810
he's probably got all kinds of
shit inside of him that shit.

97
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:46,630
But I mean like when you meet a
guy like that, you're like, wow,

98
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:50,020
that's a different type of person.
Look how big he is. Like Shaq,

99
00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:52,900
like when Shaq comes around UFC fighters,

100
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:56,770
there's a photo of shack and he
was training at American top team.

101
00:05:56,830 --> 00:06:00,770
My friend Dean Thomas Dean is like,
uh, I guess deans like five, nine,

102
00:06:00,771 --> 00:06:04,070
five 10 and he's standing next to
Shaq and Shaq is Stan next to junior.

103
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:06,800
Dosantos used to be the heavyweight
champion that looks like his child.

104
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,730
It looks like Shaq's child because he's
so small and Jay and Shaq still like,

105
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,610
what, seven foot? Like he hasn't
shrunk at all. He's fucking g,

106
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:18,380
he's a legitimate gigantic human
being. I mean, he's fucking huge.

107
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:22,460
I like the fact that there's people
that are, that are different. It's cool.

108
00:06:22,461 --> 00:06:25,520
It's interesting. You know,
the real problem is racism.

109
00:06:25,521 --> 00:06:26,900
The real problem is not that,

110
00:06:26,901 --> 00:06:30,190
that there's variety and the variety
part's interesting. It's also like, man,

111
00:06:30,191 --> 00:06:32,390
this new racism, you know, like
there's so much of the, uh,

112
00:06:32,391 --> 00:06:34,760
the cancel culture and the, you know,
you can't say what you can't say.

113
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:38,330
And it's like, that's not scary
racism like it used to be. Right.

114
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:41,390
I think people are more scared about
the, uh, the silent racism than like,

115
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:44,330
you know, that over, you
know, aggressive racism.

116
00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:46,910
You're like the lynching in the 50s
and forties. And you know, before,

117
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:50,930
while we all know that that stuff
happened less than a hundred years ago,

118
00:06:50,931 --> 00:06:54,020
which is why it's scary when you see
photographs like those black and white

119
00:06:54,021 --> 00:06:56,300
photographs of the
families standing around.

120
00:06:56,301 --> 00:06:58,940
Why there's a black guy hanging
from a tree behind. I'm like that,

121
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:01,840
that is not that long ago. No. So that,

122
00:07:01,841 --> 00:07:04,190
that shit is still in
the air down there. Yeah.

123
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:07,490
But now this new racism was
like, Oh, you can't, uh,

124
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:11,190
you can't talk about Trans Kids, you
know? Well that's not racism. But yeah,

125
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:15,350
it's, it's w that's just with
that is, is authoritarianism.

126
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:19,930
They're just trying to enforce a certain
way of thinking and behaving. And they,

127
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:25,130
they go hard on anybody who
deviates pour all Mario Lopez, poor,

128
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:27,080
nicest guy that's ever lived.

129
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:30,560
It doesn't have a fucking controversial
bone in his body. And he's like, well,

130
00:07:30,561 --> 00:07:33,110
I don't think kids should be trans.
I mean, they're little babies.

131
00:07:33,111 --> 00:07:33,411
And they're like,

132
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:37,370
what you wouldn't sensitive is cause
they can go after him for something like

133
00:07:37,371 --> 00:07:39,320
that and he'll acquiesce, he'll give in.

134
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:43,070
That's almost like becking into
like that old segregated of a, like,

135
00:07:43,071 --> 00:07:44,180
I guess like, you know, Jim Crow thing.

136
00:07:44,181 --> 00:07:46,580
I remember like it will another
blanket told me Emmett till,

137
00:07:46,581 --> 00:07:48,890
but remember when Emmett till gets
killed, right. It's because of, you know,

138
00:07:48,891 --> 00:07:52,270
he's doing, uh, he's saying, hey,
you look on a prettier, he's like,

139
00:07:52,271 --> 00:07:53,690
he's the only cat call to a lady, right?

140
00:07:53,691 --> 00:07:56,030
And then this woman goes and tells
these group of dudes was like, Hey,

141
00:07:56,031 --> 00:07:59,120
and they're just like, oh, we gotta
cancel Emmett till. You know what I mean?

142
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:02,720
So it's almost, it's almost the same
thing. I'm not saying it's, it's that,

143
00:08:02,721 --> 00:08:05,750
you know, aggressive and violent, but
it's, it's the same thing of like,

144
00:08:05,751 --> 00:08:09,410
you can't say anything. You can't
have a brain. Like if there's a,

145
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:14,510
there's, I want to say like a criminal
thought, now I'm having a thought,

146
00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:19,060
right? There's thought crime. Yeah. I
mean, that's the Orwell Shit right there.

147
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:24,250
Just what people are deeply concerned
about as a Thoratec Korean reinforcement

148
00:08:24,501 --> 00:08:27,020
of their own particular way
of thinking and behaving.

149
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:30,140
And it's because people have
the opportunity to complain now.

150
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:35,410
Like if you just didn't like the way
someone addressed women or someone,

151
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:40,670
you really didn't have a way
to broadcast it 20 years ago,

152
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:41,693
there's still like you just,

153
00:08:42,170 --> 00:08:47,170
but now anybody can just get on Twitter
or Facebook and it can go viral.

154
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:51,800
And a bunch of other fucking pink haired
Weirdos will retweet you and next thing

155
00:08:51,801 --> 00:08:55,020
you know, there's a goddamn mob after
Mario Lopez. Right? I mean that's,

156
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:58,700
that's what happened. It's
interesting though. I mean it's,

157
00:08:58,701 --> 00:09:00,420
it's weird to watch it all take place,

158
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:05,660
especially from our business because
comedy relies on taboos and in a lot of

159
00:09:05,941 --> 00:09:07,770
ways, like they're reinforcing us.

160
00:09:07,771 --> 00:09:12,360
They're helping us because people come
to us for relief. Yeah. Thank you. Yeah.

161
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:15,090
Thank you. Yeah, keep, keep
the PC culture going. Honestly,

162
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:18,510
it's only making us more money.
It's making us more accessible.

163
00:09:18,511 --> 00:09:20,720
Really appreciate that. Your store
has never been more [inaudible].

164
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:23,040
People were coming in like they're
looking to hear those things. Oh,

165
00:09:23,041 --> 00:09:26,760
they're so happy when you go against the
grain. When you go hard in the paint,

166
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:31,620
they go crazy. Love it. They love it.
Bring it on OJ and bring him back. Oh,

167
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:34,080
Jay's fucking Twitter. Have you
been paid attention to the eyes?

168
00:09:34,081 --> 00:09:38,090
Don't follow it, Joe. I just said, you
can't follow OJ on Twitter. That's crazy.

169
00:09:38,091 --> 00:09:42,810
I follow him. Do you fuck? Yeah,
because it's great. A Doug,

170
00:09:42,811 --> 00:09:45,060
Stan hope and I, back in the day
when we were hosting the mantra,

171
00:09:45,061 --> 00:09:49,950
we had an idea for a having OJ
Simpson. At the end of every show,

172
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:54,570
OJ Simpson would be like a Andy Rooney
and he would like break down the problems

173
00:09:54,571 --> 00:09:58,740
in America. That's what I think
about. Hey, Twitter world.

174
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:00,000
And so that's what he's doing.

175
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:03,360
He's literally doing what Doug and
I wanted him to do on the man show.

176
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:06,240
But he's doing it all on his own.
Like he was talking about the debates.

177
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:10,860
He goes, is it just me or
does Tulsi and Andrew Young,

178
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:13,230
are they the only ones that
are following the rules?

179
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:18,520
I'm just saying following
the [inaudible] getting,

180
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:22,040
give me some volume. Is it my hold up
goes to the beginning of second here.

181
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,430
Hey Twitter. Well that's my favorite part.

182
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:29,810
Is it my imagination that Yang and
Gabbert are the only two who know how to

183
00:10:30,811 --> 00:10:33,540
follow the rules of this?

184
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:43,290
I'm just saying he just saying voice of
reason, but what you can't even vote.

185
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:47,190
He's a convicted felon though,
right? Uh, yeah. So yeah, like,

186
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,570
oh j what have you been involved?

187
00:10:48,571 --> 00:10:51,960
You can't even vote because he wants
to know where everything's going.

188
00:10:51,961 --> 00:10:55,500
I mean he talks about the NFL draft,
he talks that he's got a lot of sports,

189
00:10:55,501 --> 00:10:59,910
talk on his Twitter, telling people they
should get paid more and you need to,

190
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:03,510
you know, draft this guy
and bring this guy in.

191
00:11:03,511 --> 00:11:07,580
And so just the GM now. All right,
I'll let you know. This is a thing.

192
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:09,090
There's like you could,

193
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:13,650
you could have done some stuff like he
could have embezzled some money and went

194
00:11:13,651 --> 00:11:18,230
to jail and got out or maybe
didn't file taxes. Like,

195
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:21,870
like if Wesley Snipes who went to jail
for tax evasion and he started talking

196
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:25,390
about politics or he wouldn't
care you like that? No,

197
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:30,490
but yet killed two people. Oh, Jay.
And allegedly he got off for that. Joe,

198
00:11:30,491 --> 00:11:35,430
come on. Kill two people. I'm saying
he killed him. He killed two people.

199
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:36,960
I just think he's wrong.
What happened to Ron Goldman?

200
00:11:36,961 --> 00:11:39,450
Nobody even talks about him.
No, nobody gives a fuck man.

201
00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:41,820
They talk about the
wife. Yeah, all the time.

202
00:11:41,821 --> 00:11:43,140
They never talk about the other guy.

203
00:11:43,141 --> 00:11:47,010
He was like 25 and just to fucking wait
or man bringing someone sunglasses back

204
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:50,220
whose side deck. He was bringing the
deck. Right, right place. Wrong time.

205
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:52,620
Was He bringing the deck? Was
that, is that been proven?

206
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:55,440
They were sleeping together, right.
That's what it was. That's the Bambi.

207
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:58,840
That's also rumor. Allegedly. We don't
even know. We can't even ask them. Yeah,

208
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:03,040
I have no idea. I'm
trying to find a killers.

209
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:07,450
Ron Goldman world is there as like
a holiday. He does. He really does.

210
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:10,690
Ron Goldman day today. I'm
Brian Moses. Joe Rogan episode.

211
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:15,220
I knew his sister back in the day.
Really? Yeah. She used to come around the,

212
00:12:15,221 --> 00:12:18,830
the set of news radio. I knew her from
back then and she was very nice. Tibbs,

213
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:19,720
devastating though.

214
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:24,780
It was like knowing someone whose
brother was murdered and you know you're

215
00:12:25,181 --> 00:12:27,580
hanging out with her. It's
like always in the air.

216
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:31,300
You know it's always in the
air. Yeah. That's like a,

217
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,910
she had like a pin with
her brother's face on it.

218
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:35,590
I should bring you some
like black barbecues.

219
00:12:35,650 --> 00:12:38,200
It's a lot of sisters there who
lot of, you know, brothers Gumbo.

220
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:43,510
But the difference is it's ultra,
ultra public versus pre-internet.

221
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:47,790
Right? Yeah. That was the biggest
thing to date. Oh my God, it was,

222
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:51,520
I was watching the verdict
with my girlfriend at the time.

223
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:55,120
We're sitting in front of the TV and
I'll never forget when they said not

224
00:12:55,121 --> 00:12:59,230
guilty, my girlfriend put her
hand on her face. I'm like, oh no,

225
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:04,180
no, no, it's crazy. Believe
it. She couldn't believe it.

226
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:07,140
Cause I remember being like, I was like,
it was either elementary schoolers,

227
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:09,790
middle school and remember the Burdick
happening and it was like a split

228
00:13:09,791 --> 00:13:11,140
verdict. My teacher who was white,

229
00:13:11,141 --> 00:13:13,390
she was like devastated and
like all the black kids,

230
00:13:13,391 --> 00:13:16,870
it was like me and another kid,
we were so happy. We're just like,

231
00:13:16,871 --> 00:13:19,270
yes cause we didn't know any better.
You know what I mean? We're just like,

232
00:13:19,271 --> 00:13:21,280
we're just happy because the black
guy got up because of what happened.

233
00:13:21,281 --> 00:13:23,290
Rodney King, we're just
like, this is redemption.

234
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:25,780
That's how many people felt about it.

235
00:13:25,781 --> 00:13:30,370
They felt like the Rodney king
thing was so fucked up that,

236
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:34,120
I mean the problem with the Rodney
King thing is you only see the end.

237
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:34,870
I'm Halley.

238
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:39,220
He led them on a crazy high speed chase
and there was fights and he was a big

239
00:13:39,221 --> 00:13:40,900
fellow and he was on PCP.

240
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:45,880
So swinging for the fences until they
had to beat him down apparently according

241
00:13:45,881 --> 00:13:49,210
to the cops. But then, you know, a piece
of meat like makes your bones stronger,

242
00:13:49,211 --> 00:13:53,950
doesn't it? No, it makes you really
like impervious to pain though.

243
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:57,970
I had a friend who got his finger
bitten off when he was on PCP and never,

244
00:13:58,090 --> 00:14:00,160
they didn't feel it h until you woke up.

245
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:02,620
I don't think he remembers
cause he was so fucked up.

246
00:14:02,621 --> 00:14:07,510
But he was a boxer and he had
his, uh, his toe removed his,

247
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:11,050
uh, not as, not as pinky toe or
not his fat toe, the big toe,

248
00:14:11,051 --> 00:14:15,070
but the one next to it and put it where
his index finger was on his right hand,

249
00:14:15,071 --> 00:14:18,040
moved his toe to his finger and move
to the total finger and curved it

250
00:14:18,041 --> 00:14:20,740
permanently so he could
throw right hooks. Oh,

251
00:14:20,741 --> 00:14:24,130
there's not performance
enhancing? No. No. Not at all.

252
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:26,860
When you'd shake your hand, he
would give you like the little, the,

253
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:31,300
the little finger. Oh. Cause they
don't make it so it can bend again.

254
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:34,810
It was just bet like this forever.
So if he was punching you,

255
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:39,250
that was the only way. So when he opened
it, it would stay curled. Damn. Yeah.

256
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:43,330
He's a hard man. And he was on PCP, PCP
at the time. He was, we're hanging out.

257
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:48,810
I use my boxing coach.
He was a mad man. Yeah.

258
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,950
Legit bad man. Wouldn't that
be performance enhancing,

259
00:14:51,951 --> 00:14:54,770
taking PCP like while being in a fight
because you can just get the shit beat

260
00:14:54,771 --> 00:14:57,770
out of you. Yeah, yeah, yeah. For
sure. But you'd be too aggressive.

261
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:01,700
You would like if a guy was, uh, it's
not gonna make you a better fighter.

262
00:15:02,170 --> 00:15:02,440
I mean,

263
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:05,840
you wouldn't want your opponent to be
on PCP because they would have no fear.

264
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,250
They would just come charge, not you.

265
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:09,620
They might be able to just fuck you up
just because of that if you panicked.

266
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:13,370
But if you are a seasoned fighter
and a guy had PC was on PCP,

267
00:15:13,371 --> 00:15:16,190
he would just come charge and recklessly
just crack him as he's coming in and

268
00:15:16,191 --> 00:15:19,640
keep moving and they said like the LAPD
eventually his body would wear out.

269
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:23,470
Your body can only take so
much until it becomes mush.

270
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:26,580
And there's a lot of people that believe
in themselves and they get flatlined

271
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:31,250
100% believe in themselves. You
gotta to fucking believe in it, bro.

272
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:35,330
If you believe you can achieve.
MMM, not really. You know,

273
00:15:35,331 --> 00:15:38,270
if you believe in yourself or Francis
and God who punches you in the face,

274
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:42,410
you're going into the spirit world or
like what it costs beats you down like for

275
00:15:42,411 --> 00:15:46,430
like eight minutes. Yeah. Yeah. With
club clubs. It like metal clue and club.

276
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:50,120
Yeah, there was that pre tasers.
Did they not have tasers back then?

277
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:53,690
So that was after the, uh, the Ciocca
cause you couldn't show guys out anymore.

278
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:55,430
So that's what they said.

279
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:57,440
They'd beat them down because they
couldn't choke them out. Really?

280
00:15:57,830 --> 00:16:00,710
They couldn't choke him cause
right. They put a ban on chokehold.

281
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:03,960
Why'd they do that? Because
they were killing guys. Oh.

282
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:06,560
Cause they were saying guys were on PCP
when they weren't on PCP and they were

283
00:16:06,561 --> 00:16:09,050
like literally killing dudes. Were
they killing them with their arms?

284
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:13,220
Were they using a nightclub, a stick?
One guy killed with a stick, I think.

285
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:15,960
Yeah, that was a stick. Then the
second case was a guy who, uh,

286
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:18,430
like [inaudible] naked choking them.

287
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:23,240
I know I do to kill the guy with the
choke in the ring. No, killed them in a,

288
00:16:23,241 --> 00:16:27,050
in a jam. He was banging this guy's
wife. Oh, he really went for him. Yeah,

289
00:16:27,051 --> 00:16:27,621
it was crazy.

290
00:16:27,621 --> 00:16:30,590
He was banging the guy's wife and he
invited the guy to the school and then

291
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:32,210
choked him to death and killed him.

292
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:36,560
And then was driving the guy's car
around town. I think that's cold blood.

293
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:39,620
And then they arrested him. Yeah,
he was a interesting character.

294
00:16:39,621 --> 00:16:41,930
He was a fake Brazilian
jujitsu black belt.

295
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:46,990
My friend Eddie Bravo called him out.
Wait a minute. Fake. Yeah, he's fake.

296
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:50,570
He's a fake black belt telling everybody
he was a black belt and Eddie rolled

297
00:16:50,571 --> 00:16:52,550
with them. I remember him
coming back to me and he's like,

298
00:16:52,551 --> 00:16:56,600
that guy's not a black belt. I go,
what are you sure? And he goes, dude,

299
00:16:56,601 --> 00:17:00,050
he don't know anything. Like it
was crazy. It was like barely.

300
00:17:00,051 --> 00:17:02,720
It was like a white belt and you
can get killed doing shit like that.

301
00:17:02,721 --> 00:17:05,090
I thought maybe he was
doing it because he was,

302
00:17:05,570 --> 00:17:08,510
maybe he was just being nice and
wasn't going hard. And he goes,

303
00:17:08,511 --> 00:17:09,640
but then as time goes
on, I was really like,

304
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:11,090
this guy doesn't know
what the fuck he's doing.

305
00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:15,090
And so then he calls him up and
he was like, Hey, are you off?

306
00:17:15,530 --> 00:17:18,680
Are you a fucking black belt? Like tell
me. The guy's like, well, you know,

307
00:17:18,681 --> 00:17:21,380
I'm a black belt in Japanese.
Jujitsu's go, stop, stop. Stop. Stop.

308
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:25,610
Are you a fucking black belt? And it
was like this big pause. He's like, Bro,

309
00:17:25,611 --> 00:17:27,680
you're a fucking liar. You're a liar.

310
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:32,150
So Eddie separated himself from
the guy and then years later,

311
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:37,440
dude wound up murdering somebody. Oh yeah.

312
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:41,750
What'd you Jitsu? Yeah. Murder. The guy
with Jujitsu. You're single, the guy.

313
00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:45,380
Well, you know, I could teach you how
to put a choke it in five seconds.

314
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:48,470
It wouldn't take long at all. Yeah,
I could teach you how to do it.

315
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:52,800
Just wrap your forum underneath someone's
neck. Clamp your hand, your bicep.

316
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:56,070
Put his arm behind the head.
Squeeze. You could kill somebody.

317
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:57,690
It's not a hard thing to learn,

318
00:17:57,930 --> 00:18:00,930
but to actually apply it to someone
who knows what they're doing,

319
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:03,750
you'd have to get, you have to be
really good. Like you can't just,

320
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:06,150
no one's going to let you choke them.
But this guy didn't know anything.

321
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:09,450
So I think he snuck up behind this
guy who he killed and just choked him,

322
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:11,640
choked him to death. It's
not like the OJ murder.

323
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:15,480
I think he brought the guy to his school
under false premises. He's in jail now.

324
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:20,400
I shouldn't shout out to that guy.
Yeah. It was weird because I got a,

325
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:25,820
I got semi involved in it in that the
guy who wound up ratting him out to the

326
00:18:26,581 --> 00:18:31,581
cops was one of Eddy students and I was
talking to the guy on the phone about it

327
00:18:32,601 --> 00:18:34,080
and I was like, what's
going on with that guy?

328
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:37,140
And then the cops called me
afterwards and said, hey,

329
00:18:37,141 --> 00:18:41,400
we were tapping that guy's phone. We
want to know what, you know? Whoa,

330
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:46,520
whoa. I'm on the fucking set of fear
factor. I'm in my trailer. Jesus. Yeah.

331
00:18:46,910 --> 00:18:49,970
Okay. Putting my microphone on. I'm
like, Whoa, you're in a murder case.

332
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:53,430
I'm like, Hey, listen, I don't know
that guy. I go, this is what I know.

333
00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:56,400
He's a fake black belt. I
told him the whole deal. Um,

334
00:18:57,420 --> 00:18:58,830
and I had heard that he killed some money,

335
00:18:58,831 --> 00:19:02,280
but I wasn't sure if it was true
because the guy is so full of shit.

336
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:03,840
This is how full of shit this guy was.

337
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:09,600
This guy had a friend drop him off in
the woods because he said he was going to

338
00:19:09,601 --> 00:19:14,010
a Kuma take karate contest, like a
big karate competition. But it was,

339
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:17,610
it was no rules and it was secretive.
So he dropped him off in the woods.

340
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:20,250
Where was this guy from? I Dunno. I Dunno.

341
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:21,610
But he lived in California for awhile.

342
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:26,700
He dropped him off in the woods with a
Duffel bag. He gave him a duffle bag,

343
00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:28,230
like he had a duffle bag with him rather.

344
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:33,180
And it's like a Duffel bag that's just
big enough to fit a trophy in it. Right?

345
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:36,840
Like about this big. So he, he
leaves, goes out into the woods.

346
00:19:36,841 --> 00:19:40,140
The guy comes back the next day,
he's got a trophy, no duffle bag.

347
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:46,120
So he brought a fucking trophy with him
and then he came out of the woods like,

348
00:19:46,501 --> 00:19:50,040
yeah, I won a fucked everybody
up. And like, so this guy would,

349
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:53,880
he thought this guy would tell everybody
that he be beat everybody in this

350
00:19:53,881 --> 00:19:55,950
karate tournament. You guys a
hell of an actor? He's really,

351
00:19:55,951 --> 00:19:57,750
I mean he really commits. He was,

352
00:19:58,110 --> 00:20:02,070
he was one of those guys that snuck
through my crazy radar cause he's a friend

353
00:20:02,071 --> 00:20:06,540
of a friend. So I was, I assumed,
you know, I was fucking 30 years old.

354
00:20:06,541 --> 00:20:08,520
I didn't know any better.
I was dumb. And I was like,

355
00:20:08,521 --> 00:20:12,990
I assumed 30 30 once you fully cooked
by them. Nah, you think you are.

356
00:20:13,490 --> 00:20:16,230
You don't think you are. You haven't
met enough murderers yet. Shit.

357
00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:19,500
You have to meet enough really legitimate,

358
00:20:19,501 --> 00:20:23,550
crazy people that have them
in the database. We were
like, Oh, you're fucking,

359
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:27,870
you're a sociopath. Oh
well what's worth worse?

360
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:32,370
A psycho or sociopath, sociopath. As
someone who doesn't care about someone,

361
00:20:32,371 --> 00:20:36,090
a psychopath. I think as someone
who violently attacks people,

362
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:39,750
but in many ways they're interchangeable,
like go. So let's Google that.

363
00:20:39,930 --> 00:20:42,780
What is the difference between
a sociopath and a psychopath?

364
00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:47,100
Because I think a sociopath
can have no violent tendencies,

365
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:48,130
but I think the idea is

366
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:51,150
that they have no compassion
for other people. Right?

367
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:54,790
Like I have a friend and she
thinks her sisters associate belts.

368
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,220
Everybody thinks that everybody's
a fucking sociopath these days.

369
00:20:57,221 --> 00:20:59,220
That's like a hot, that's
the hot word these days.

370
00:20:59,410 --> 00:21:02,680
Like calling somebody a racist or
on someone and Nazi. Exactly. Yeah.

371
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:05,770
The quick thing I pulled
out and we'll put it up.

372
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:08,980
So will you explain exactly what it said,
but there's just like a venn diagram.

373
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:12,610
It's, that's a better
explanation. By the way,

374
00:21:12,611 --> 00:21:14,440
every woman who's you know who's
going to hear this, he'll be like,

375
00:21:14,441 --> 00:21:17,320
he is a sociopath. So there's
something in the middle. There's like,

376
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:18,303
you could be both.

377
00:21:18,430 --> 00:21:22,930
So genetically predisposed psych
about genetically predisposed.

378
00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:25,990
My parents would have to be psychopaths.
What's happening with the screen there,

379
00:21:25,991 --> 00:21:26,730
buddy?

380
00:21:26,730 --> 00:21:30,540
I switched. I would have done on purpose.

381
00:21:31,170 --> 00:21:35,790
You should connect again. Maybe not
to be, it's dead. There it goes.

382
00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:40,830
Oh, even better. Okay. Lacks
empathy. A psych is psychopath.

383
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:43,410
Genetically predisposed
lacks empathy and guilt.

384
00:21:43,411 --> 00:21:46,970
Convincing behavior like how
they spell behavior. That's, Oh,

385
00:21:47,170 --> 00:21:50,880
going I even Kenai tonight. But look
how, so let's spell behavior. Oh yeah.

386
00:21:50,881 --> 00:21:55,650
With the io Io, you are higher
job success. Why? That's okay.

387
00:21:55,980 --> 00:22:00,750
Antisocial personality disorders can
form social relationships and treatable.

388
00:22:00,751 --> 00:22:05,220
That's the one in the middle. Okay. So
the no path, environmentally influenced,

389
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:09,960
feel empathy and guilt, erratic
behavior struggles to find a keep chops.

390
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:13,410
Wait a minute. I thought
sociopath didn't feel empathy.

391
00:22:14,550 --> 00:22:17,040
I think that was just a British,

392
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:22,740
definitely psychopath doesn't change it
like it's the same one that was still

393
00:22:23,281 --> 00:22:27,540
doing path. Does care, sociopath would
feel no guilt about hurting a stranger.

394
00:22:27,541 --> 00:22:29,980
So how is that saying? Same
thing, but it's not the same.

395
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:32,490
The same thing it says, it
feels, they feel empathy.

396
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:36,390
When you look at that chart it
says sociopath feel empathy,

397
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:42,300
whatever. It's close. We kind
of get it and kill it. Sure.

398
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:46,020
But I feel like a lot of a, you
know, stand up comics as, as,

399
00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:48,900
as much as they're narcissistic, they
might, they might also be sociopath.

400
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:52,290
Think a lot of people that get to a
point in their career where there's,

401
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:57,060
they're trying so hard to be successful
that it becomes all about them.

402
00:22:57,330 --> 00:22:57,990
Right?

403
00:22:57,990 --> 00:23:02,990
Like it's becomes such an obsession and
the narcissism is so strong that all

404
00:23:04,561 --> 00:23:09,180
they really care about is their own
good and their own, their own success.

405
00:23:09,490 --> 00:23:12,830
Right. And they'll fuck people over.
That's, that's a fact. I mean, yeah,

406
00:23:13,050 --> 00:23:16,350
I've seen it. Yeah. It's kind of
sociopathic. Yeah. Have you lived it?

407
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:19,220
Live it a little bit. A little bit.
And we'll talk. We'll talk about,

408
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:22,020
or you wanna keep it honest.
We should keep it on the hush.

409
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:25,020
We can't break it on this one.
We'll come back to that one.

410
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:29,790
We'll do that when the cameras stopped
rolling. Those experiences, you know,

411
00:23:29,791 --> 00:23:30,510
when you find it,

412
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:33,530
you find it when you start getting a
little bit of success and it's like even

413
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:34,980
much, right? You can be anything.

414
00:23:35,530 --> 00:23:39,180
You get a development deal and all
of a sudden people are like, oh,

415
00:23:39,810 --> 00:23:43,410
there's people that equate good things
happening to other people as bad things

416
00:23:43,411 --> 00:23:46,040
happening to them. And
that's the narcism. That's

417
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:50,840
that. Yeah. That's dream Egomania.
Right. Extreme extreme narcissism.

418
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:56,570
And obviously you have to be, this
has to be something wrong with you.

419
00:23:56,930 --> 00:23:59,690
Most of the time, not,
not 100% of the time,

420
00:23:59,691 --> 00:24:03,390
but most of the time to want to
be a comedian. Right? Absolutely.

421
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:04,293
And something's gotta be wrong.

422
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:07,010
Cause this is like your ego gets
kicked in the Dick every day.

423
00:24:07,370 --> 00:24:09,530
Especially in this town. So
just taking that every day,

424
00:24:09,531 --> 00:24:12,340
you have to have something a
little wrong with you. Yeah, yeah.

425
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:16,970
No better way to see it than the
goddamn open mic nights, bro.

426
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:19,910
Oh, the store. I don't,
I can't go anymore.

427
00:24:19,911 --> 00:24:23,320
I used to be able to go and just
watch, but now it's so fucking crazy.

428
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:26,510
It's just, I can't, especially the comedy
store because now there's a crowd now.

429
00:24:26,690 --> 00:24:28,850
I mean back when, I mean, I
remember when I was like coming up,

430
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:31,430
there was no crowd. It was just,
it was just your peers open.

431
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:36,170
Mike nights are pack pack. Yeah. Like
with a real audience. Yeah. Like that's,

432
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:37,790
you guys would guys are stealing.

433
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:43,210
There's people that are fans of comedy
now that want to see the process.

434
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:46,790
Really? Yeah. Is that what that
is? Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

435
00:24:46,930 --> 00:24:51,620
There's a wonder that change
podcast. Oh, that makes sense.

436
00:24:51,650 --> 00:24:54,620
We started talking about it on
podcasts and next thing you know,

437
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:57,590
I think over the last
like six, seven years,

438
00:24:57,860 --> 00:25:00,260
you start to see people that are
like, I want to know what it's like.

439
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:04,770
What does it cause? They love going
to see like headliners. Like if you,

440
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:08,210
if you love going to see
the fully finished product,

441
00:25:08,690 --> 00:25:10,340
you want to see what it's like to see.

442
00:25:10,341 --> 00:25:12,440
It's almost like going to
watch an amateur's fight.

443
00:25:12,770 --> 00:25:15,740
Like I'll keep an eye on him. Maybe one
day he'll be the champ. I hear that.

444
00:25:15,741 --> 00:25:18,530
But then it's also, I mean there's
that, but I feel like spiting yeah,

445
00:25:18,531 --> 00:25:20,390
you can kind of see somebody
style here and there.

446
00:25:20,391 --> 00:25:23,180
But with comedy you see everybody
started going to see a young guy who's

447
00:25:23,181 --> 00:25:25,280
probably doing like a Dave Chappelle
type of thing and the guys who are like

448
00:25:25,281 --> 00:25:27,390
doing Jim Gaffigan captain thing,
you know Joe Rogan kind of thing,

449
00:25:27,490 --> 00:25:29,150
you know Mitch Hedberg
kind of thing. Yeah.

450
00:25:29,210 --> 00:25:31,760
So that's just what opened Mike and we're
going to see a bunch of copycats until

451
00:25:31,761 --> 00:25:33,530
they figured out. You can't just do that.

452
00:25:33,710 --> 00:25:38,660
But what's cool about it is you go from
that and then you can go into the other

453
00:25:38,661 --> 00:25:42,380
room. Like you can go into the main room
and there'll be a real show going on.

454
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:47,060
Kill Tony. Yeah. So you could
see both on the same day,

455
00:25:47,330 --> 00:25:50,520
like you really can, you can
go see a real comic. Yeah.

456
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:53,270
You can see open mic night and then
at the end of the open mic night,

457
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:56,820
like Chappelle shows up at pop up
all the time. Right dice clay. Yeah,

458
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:57,590
all the time.

459
00:25:57,590 --> 00:26:02,590
So you literally watched these amateurs
and then boom of like a world renowned

460
00:26:04,310 --> 00:26:06,920
professional shows up. You're like,
oh, that's the finished product.

461
00:26:06,921 --> 00:26:08,600
We get it though. Yeah. But
yeah, they're never going to be,

462
00:26:08,601 --> 00:26:12,950
I mean that's crazy. That's the
guy. But somebody used to be,

463
00:26:12,951 --> 00:26:16,850
I mean Chappelle was an open miker we
all were open makers. When did you start?

464
00:26:16,910 --> 00:26:20,090
Like oh, how old were you? 88 I was
21. 21. Okay. Yeah, he was like, what?

465
00:26:20,091 --> 00:26:23,760
14 when he started like he was a
baby. Yeah. Wouldn't even get in. Um,

466
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:26,150
I think they'd let him in. I
didn't know you could get in.

467
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:27,650
I thought you had to be 21,

468
00:26:27,651 --> 00:26:31,970
because the same bar and it turns out
there's like a law where you can be,

469
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:36,980
I think in Massachusetts you could be
18 with like a note to perform at a

470
00:26:36,981 --> 00:26:39,710
nightclub. Dave said to make sure
that they didn't serve you alcohol.

471
00:26:40,190 --> 00:26:41,023
When I met Dave,

472
00:26:41,690 --> 00:26:46,690
I think Dave is like four or five
years younger than me and I was 23 or

473
00:26:47,401 --> 00:26:52,220
something like that. And he was
a baby at 17 probably. Yeah.

474
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:57,970
Yeah. I met him at the catch rising star
catch rising star in Boston. All right.

475
00:26:57,990 --> 00:27:00,090
Not In Boston. In New York. Yeah. Yeah.

476
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:04,110
I was already passed all
the clubs at that point. Um,

477
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:06,450
he must have been, he must have been,

478
00:27:06,451 --> 00:27:09,060
he was on stage and they were
already talking about, I'm like,

479
00:27:09,090 --> 00:27:13,890
look at this young kid, like he's so
talented. I remember the Silverman Sarah,

480
00:27:13,891 --> 00:27:16,950
she was telling me, she was like, I
remember when a Chappelle got, no,

481
00:27:16,951 --> 00:27:19,020
Brooks is uh, one of
the last films, the uh,

482
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:21,840
men in tights and it was like the big
talk in New York. And she's like, hey,

483
00:27:21,841 --> 00:27:25,080
that 19 year old kid just got a
a millbrook's, you know, do, wow.

484
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:28,350
The world was a different
place back then. Yeah,

485
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:34,020
it was Isaac Hayes was alive.
Yeah, that's true. Yeah.

486
00:27:34,530 --> 00:27:37,890
So it was different times. There
was a, you guys were scared of aids.

487
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:40,140
This was the 90s right.
So, yeah, so aids was big.

488
00:27:40,141 --> 00:27:41,370
You couldn't really fuck anybody.

489
00:27:41,371 --> 00:27:44,840
The first time I got an aids test
I was so nervous. Really? Oh yeah.

490
00:27:44,890 --> 00:27:47,850
It just was a slideshow. Every
bad decision I'd ever made.

491
00:27:48,270 --> 00:27:50,580
Every time I never wore condoms,
just going through my hand,

492
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,090
cause everybody was convinced there was a,

493
00:27:54,091 --> 00:27:57,870
it was funny because at the same time
Kennison had a bit where he goes like,

494
00:27:57,871 --> 00:28:00,690
they say Sam, they say aids
is a communicable disease.

495
00:28:01,310 --> 00:28:02,490
Straight people can get
it too. He goes, no,

496
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:12,030
fuck you. It's not our
dance. And people were so,

497
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:16,640
you know, people were so mad. Well, I'm
glad now, but I was just, you know, we,

498
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:19,380
when it happened, I remember in my car,

499
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:23,430
I was living in Boston in my car driving
and I was listening to the radio and

500
00:28:23,431 --> 00:28:28,320
Magic Johnson had a press conference to
announce that he had HIV and it was like

501
00:28:28,321 --> 00:28:32,370
a scene in a Zombie movie where the
first person got bit and I was like,

502
00:28:32,430 --> 00:28:36,960
oh my God, it's happening. Holy Shit.

503
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:40,290
Oh my God. Magic Johnson
with all his money.

504
00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:45,480
That guy's got HIV. Yeah. Oh my
God, we're fucked. We're fucked.

505
00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:47,340
I remember thinking that. And then, um,

506
00:28:47,490 --> 00:28:51,570
it was probably like a year or two
later I got, I got an aids test

507
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:57,690
after magic. Got It. Two years later
I didn't have health insurance.

508
00:28:57,910 --> 00:29:00,690
Forget there was like they cost
money back then. Oh yeah, yeah.

509
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,670
Pigs another just free. Yeah.

510
00:29:02,671 --> 00:29:06,360
Well now they want people to not get aids
or people just get aid sometimes just

511
00:29:06,361 --> 00:29:10,800
to get the free healthcare. Really?
Yeah. There's, I mean, I've wanted this,

512
00:29:10,801 --> 00:29:12,810
this is a rumor on the Strip
her in the gay community,

513
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:14,550
cause I live in the gay
community and not that I am,

514
00:29:14,551 --> 00:29:17,280
but I'm saying I live there because it's
clean and [inaudible] wrong with gay

515
00:29:17,281 --> 00:29:20,750
people. Right, exactly. There's
nothing wrong, right. Anyway,

516
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:24,650
a gay neighborhood cause it's safe. It's
safe. Oh my God, it's, I said, yeah,

517
00:29:24,690 --> 00:29:28,290
I just worry about, you know, anyway,
uh, but Dr Keys, when you're naked,

518
00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:32,760
you don't go outside naked anymore jail.
Uh, but yeah, they uh, they say like,

519
00:29:32,761 --> 00:29:34,530
yeah, some guys will just get it
just like the free healthcare.

520
00:29:34,910 --> 00:29:39,300
This is before Obamacare, there
was a thing called bug chasers.

521
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:44,290
Do you know what that is? It was gay
dudes that for whatever reason, look,

522
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:47,530
a lot of people are self-loathing,
right? There's people cut themselves.

523
00:29:47,531 --> 00:29:50,740
People that tattoo their face, they
hate themselves for whatever reason,

524
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:53,040
and they punish themselves
while they was host.

525
00:29:53,290 --> 00:29:56,080
Malone hates himself tattoo on his
face. There's got to be something wrong.

526
00:29:56,290 --> 00:30:00,670
Mike Tyson, like Tyson, I
think he had some issues. Yeah.

527
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:03,610
He's my favorite by the way.
Love Him. He is my spirit animal.

528
00:30:03,611 --> 00:30:06,160
I fucking love Mike Tyson. I got
Tyson weed over there. If you want to.

529
00:30:07,150 --> 00:30:10,300
Do you smoke weed? Yeah, I smoke.
How often? Every day. Every day.

530
00:30:10,301 --> 00:30:13,930
You want suboxone right now?
Tyson. We'd hope mom. Sorry.

531
00:30:17,170 --> 00:30:20,050
Breaking out the good stuff. That's
gonna knock me out. Let's do it

532
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:26,290
like Tyson. Holler at me. Please.
Find some Tyson ranch original staff,

533
00:30:26,291 --> 00:30:28,570
I think in California
city do I grew up out.

534
00:30:28,571 --> 00:30:31,600
That's what the other earthquakes
are. Oh Shit. Oh yeah.

535
00:30:33,010 --> 00:30:37,210
I think they're launching it soon.
The ranch, the ranch. Oh Shit.

536
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:43,300
He brought us a golden box. Look at
that box back there. It's amazing.

537
00:30:44,290 --> 00:30:47,080
Who made that? It wasn't
man. Whoever knows. Mike.

538
00:30:49,450 --> 00:30:54,400
What was he on? Put episodes up
to say a few months back. Oh Shit.

539
00:30:54,630 --> 00:30:59,530
The bamboo. Can't believe
he never smoked weed before.

540
00:30:59,531 --> 00:31:03,370
Did we ever never ever drink
together? We haven't smoked together.

541
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:09,040
That's outrageous.
Outrageous, joyous occasion.

542
00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:11,500
But anyway, there was bug chasers.

543
00:31:12,910 --> 00:31:17,890
Bug Chasers were dudes that for whatever
reason, for whatever reason, they,

544
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:22,980
um, they wanted to catch
HIV. They want it to, what?

545
00:31:22,990 --> 00:31:25,120
I wanted to call them bug chasers.

546
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:29,110
They would literally go
out and try to get it. Why?

547
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:32,160
I mean they hated themselves. They
wanted a dog. This is a real thing. Yeah.

548
00:31:32,250 --> 00:31:33,280
This is the, okay this is like,

549
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:36,970
like black kids would be like the
death by cop thing. Yes, yes. Yeah.

550
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:38,170
And not just black kids.

551
00:31:38,171 --> 00:31:41,140
You see that video recently the guy was
running towards the cop with a knife and

552
00:31:41,141 --> 00:31:43,000
he's fucking screaming
and yelling and he's like,

553
00:31:43,001 --> 00:31:44,530
don't make me shoot you
tell him. Shoot you.

554
00:31:44,590 --> 00:31:48,130
He just wanted to know to
start to unloaded on the
guy. Suicide by cop is super,

555
00:31:48,131 --> 00:31:51,490
super common. I did not know that. Yeah,
I thought it was just a good thing.

556
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:56,710
Now it's a, it's a real common
thing but a bug chasers were,

557
00:31:56,980 --> 00:32:01,980
I mean maybe it's still a thing but now
aids is dude aids is aids is the apple

558
00:32:02,471 --> 00:32:04,000
of diseases. It's the Oprah diseases.

559
00:32:04,870 --> 00:32:06,770
Honestly it's like when
Magic Johnson got it,

560
00:32:06,771 --> 00:32:09,760
aids was like our stock's about
to go up like fucking Disney.

561
00:32:11,470 --> 00:32:12,303
I mean,

562
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:15,790
cause you think about cracking aids kind
of came into the same time and crack

563
00:32:15,791 --> 00:32:18,990
was killing it and all of a sudden
now aids is like you get aids.

564
00:32:19,110 --> 00:32:21,680
It's like you've, it's not that.
That's a hit track. Yeah. Yeah.

565
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:25,300
Like look at fucking Charlie Sheen.
He looks great. Looks Great Dude.

566
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:29,080
Jeff at the comedy store. Yeah. Check
the comments. Just had it forever. Yeah,

567
00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:32,620
he had it like back when it wasn't
cool before. It was cool. Still got it.

568
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:36,880
It looks great. It looks great. It's
still got it, but it's HIV aids,

569
00:32:37,650 --> 00:32:40,040
full blown AIDS, but nobody gets it.

570
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:42,800
Nobody gets full blown. Some
people do. Really? Yeah.

571
00:32:42,801 --> 00:32:45,110
It's just going to live a
full blown, I don't know.

572
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:49,820
I don't know why they get it. Maybe some
people don't react to the medication.

573
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:54,200
Maybe some people don't get
treated full-blown. Well,
we can live a full blown,

574
00:32:54,230 --> 00:32:56,660
I don't know. Think you'll live
very long and then once you get,

575
00:32:56,661 --> 00:32:58,250
you can live with HIV. Yes.

576
00:32:58,460 --> 00:33:01,520
Well now they can get it to the
point where you're HIV. By the way,

577
00:33:01,850 --> 00:33:05,130
if you're a doctor and you listen
to this, we're sorry. I know we're

578
00:33:07,050 --> 00:33:10,900
here. Like you guys don't know Jack Shit.
No idea what you're talking about. Um,

579
00:33:11,090 --> 00:33:14,240
but if you, uh, here it goes,

580
00:33:14,630 --> 00:33:17,690
death usually occurs within six
months to three years from the time of

581
00:33:17,691 --> 00:33:20,150
developing full blown AIDS,
people living with aids.

582
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:22,940
Is there any other disease
that has full blown?

583
00:33:24,050 --> 00:33:27,110
It's only aids write a rap
name. You get full blown flu,

584
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:34,060
full blown aids and that's the scientific
term in the West that's so blown out.

585
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:35,900
That's sound like that.

586
00:33:35,901 --> 00:33:39,800
So Slang overloads and put that
back up so I can read it again.

587
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:43,010
I was looking for other things
with full blown in it. No,

588
00:33:43,150 --> 00:33:45,560
there's nothing else
with full bone. It uh,

589
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:48,470
people living with aids go
through periods of being sick,

590
00:33:48,471 --> 00:33:50,450
alternating with periods
of reasonable health.

591
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:54,350
It's usually one of the many opportunistic
infections that eventually caused

592
00:33:54,351 --> 00:33:55,880
death. So yeah, your,

593
00:33:55,881 --> 00:34:00,881
your immune system smashed and
that causes death full blown.

594
00:34:02,030 --> 00:34:06,730
Yeah, full blown. But HIV should,
he's like 38 now. Yeah. Shit.

595
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:11,400
HIV has been around for a minute
and happy birthday now. It's, um,

596
00:34:11,630 --> 00:34:14,480
where the point where you,
you can be undetectable,

597
00:34:14,660 --> 00:34:17,160
like magic Johnson's
apparently undetectable, right?

598
00:34:17,710 --> 00:34:20,300
Like even through aids tests,

599
00:34:20,330 --> 00:34:25,310
like when you test him for HIV
show's HIV negative or really, yeah,

600
00:34:25,970 --> 00:34:28,430
but they say it's still dormant
in the system somehow or another.

601
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:30,920
It's very confused. It's like,
like herpes almost not for him.

602
00:34:30,950 --> 00:34:31,783
Like it flares up.

603
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:35,510
I think if you ever heard [inaudible]
even if you don't have an outbreak,

604
00:34:35,690 --> 00:34:40,020
if they test you, it'll show that you
have herpes. Oh, but with HIV, yeah, with,

605
00:34:40,021 --> 00:34:42,800
with the way they have the medication,

606
00:34:43,070 --> 00:34:46,850
the way the body responds
to the medication now it
at least in some cases like

607
00:34:46,851 --> 00:34:50,600
Magic Johnson is apparently
he shows up HIV negative.

608
00:34:50,810 --> 00:34:53,990
But the weird thing is like, well
isn't he cured then? Is that cured?

609
00:34:54,850 --> 00:34:57,110
They've only two people
and he's not one of them.

610
00:34:57,260 --> 00:35:00,680
So when they have started curing
people, which I was like, okay,

611
00:35:00,681 --> 00:35:02,120
well how do they differentiate?

612
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:06,020
Like what's the difference between curing
someone and what's going on with Magic

613
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:09,260
Johnson with when he's HIV negative,
if you're anything else negative,

614
00:35:09,290 --> 00:35:12,290
they figured they cured you. Yeah. They
haven't actually. Yeah. They haven't,

615
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:15,600
they haven't deemed him. He's done
with that. Like you've cured it.

616
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:19,250
Like if you get chested for chicken pox
and it comes up negative, they've cured.

617
00:35:19,251 --> 00:35:23,770
You have chicken pox, polio, polio,
negative guy. Me The only person,

618
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:28,010
me cure of HIV. There's one more
guy now. I got one more guy now.

619
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:31,940
So what happened in this guy yet? Stem
cell treatment is what wo fixed it.

620
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:35,440
They're holding this stuff
from us. Yeah. They just had,

621
00:35:35,441 --> 00:35:38,100
they just cured another guy, I
want to say a months back as it was

622
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:38,460
this year.

623
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:42,780
They did it while there was something
and I posted it on my Twitter feed that

624
00:35:42,781 --> 00:35:44,940
apparently is an older store.

625
00:35:44,970 --> 00:35:48,930
It's from like two years ago and it was
kind of from like a click baity type

626
00:35:48,931 --> 00:35:51,330
site and it has a cool headlines,

627
00:35:51,331 --> 00:35:55,830
but it was about how a guy was paralyzed
and he's got regaining use of his legs

628
00:35:56,040 --> 00:36:00,240
because the stem cells. Really? Yeah.
I don't know enough about it. Look,

629
00:36:00,241 --> 00:36:04,470
if that's true, that'd be fucking
incredible. I don't know that from people.

630
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:08,810
Yeah. I don't know enough about how
severe the injury was versus, you know,

631
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:09,360
cause I knew,

632
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:13,230
I do know that some people get temporarily
paralyzed by certain injuries and I

633
00:36:13,231 --> 00:36:16,400
knew a dude who got slammed on his
head and his whole body went nominee,

634
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:19,470
couldn't move his body and he was like,
Oh my God, I'm paralyzed. This is a,

635
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:22,350
this is it. This is how I'm Lilla
for now on. I can't move my body.

636
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:26,820
But then his body slowly started coming
back and he just got jolted cause he was

637
00:36:26,821 --> 00:36:31,350
wrestling like a Stinger. Yeah, he
was wrestling landed on his head.

638
00:36:31,770 --> 00:36:35,370
[inaudible] scary fucking shit
man. Yeah, I mean parallels,

639
00:36:35,371 --> 00:36:37,670
I mean paralyze and yeah,
full blown aids. Yeah.

640
00:36:37,671 --> 00:36:42,330
So I don't know if they really
can bring someone back from that,

641
00:36:43,290 --> 00:36:47,190
but man, if they can't hold shit. That's
a great question though, by the way,

642
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:48,930
that because they do say
if he's HIV negative,

643
00:36:48,931 --> 00:36:50,430
they wouldn't say he's cured of it. Right.

644
00:36:50,580 --> 00:36:54,080
So then evidently does show up in some
testing somewhere. Scientists, sorry,

645
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:55,680
we're sorry. Also, how was the, Oh,

646
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:58,650
how was he the only NBA
player in history to have HIV?

647
00:37:00,210 --> 00:37:04,260
Do you remember Keenan? Every Wayne's
bit about them. No, I'm not Keenan.

648
00:37:04,290 --> 00:37:07,380
I'm sorry. Damon [inaudible]
a bit about them. Damon, who?

649
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:11,370
I sing his praises often on this podcast
and he's like the most underrated

650
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:15,070
comedian of all time. I hear that often
by the way, rates one of the grades,

651
00:37:15,570 --> 00:37:16,410
but he had a bit about,

652
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:19,650
nobody wanted to cover magic
Johnson except for Dennis Rodman.

653
00:37:20,550 --> 00:37:22,320
Dennis rob was like, I fucked Madonna.

654
00:37:22,321 --> 00:37:24,360
I'll spit in your mouth and
accelerate your symptoms.

655
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:30,120
Me is one of those
jokes where you hear it,

656
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:34,650
you can't fucking believe he said it
and you are on the floor slapping the

657
00:37:34,651 --> 00:37:37,950
ground and you're like, no, no, no.

658
00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:41,310
I mean he was a monster
monster by the way. Yeah,

659
00:37:41,430 --> 00:37:44,700
I remember like fusion form like a year
or two ago. He was years ago actually.

660
00:37:44,701 --> 00:37:49,470
Yeah. He just raided. People forgot.
It's like that Roy Jones Jr Shaw Song.

661
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:52,490
Y'All must've forgot. He
should put a special out there.

662
00:37:52,530 --> 00:37:54,940
Maybe that's what he did. He should
put a special out. It always is.

663
00:37:55,010 --> 00:37:58,710
It comes up pretty great too. He
like, he took a long time doing that.

664
00:37:58,770 --> 00:38:00,180
That TV show. That's what it was.

665
00:38:00,181 --> 00:38:02,250
People associated them
with that television show,

666
00:38:02,251 --> 00:38:06,390
which was like very family
friendly, you know, good for him.

667
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:09,060
Made a lot of money, I'm sure.
Did you ever guess though,

668
00:38:09,090 --> 00:38:11,310
is that what you're mad about? No,
no. I don't matter about anything.

669
00:38:11,311 --> 00:38:14,710
I love that guy. I love his brother
too. Keenan's cool shit. Yeah.

670
00:38:14,970 --> 00:38:17,260
Keene is like other ones against
Sean tomorrow. I know them.

671
00:38:17,490 --> 00:38:20,100
Those don't know them as well.
Yeah, Keenan, super cool.

672
00:38:20,101 --> 00:38:23,990
He's always been like a real
Downer with guy too. But uh,

673
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:27,230
I mean they have comedy bones, like
all these guys. I mean, like I,

674
00:38:27,231 --> 00:38:30,540
I worked with Marlon and he is like,
he is so funny. He's hilarious.

675
00:38:30,810 --> 00:38:34,800
The whole family. I mean, imagine a
family that does that much standup.

676
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:37,990
And I mean that's banana. I mean
the rock family too. Yes, yes.

677
00:38:38,050 --> 00:38:42,130
Jordan and Tony and obviously Chris.
Yeah, Dude. Tony's another one.

678
00:38:42,610 --> 00:38:46,740
God Damn, that Dude's funny. God Damn.
He's funny. I've never seen him love,

679
00:38:46,750 --> 00:38:51,190
but he's, I only get told I look like
him, Bro. He's one of those guys that it,

680
00:38:51,191 --> 00:38:55,480
because he's Chris Rock's
brother. People almost like, uh,

681
00:38:55,630 --> 00:38:59,650
they look almost look past him. You know,
like, Oh, you're Chris Rock's brother.

682
00:39:00,430 --> 00:39:04,270
The other rock like, dude, forget
all that. That guy's a murderer.

683
00:39:04,690 --> 00:39:09,460
He fucking kills. He's really
good. He's just funny man.

684
00:39:09,461 --> 00:39:13,570
He's just, and he's, it's like
sharp good writing, you know,

685
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:17,410
good solid punch lines and
boom, boom, boom is pacing.

686
00:39:17,530 --> 00:39:22,030
He's like a legit killer. He's
a legit killer dude. He was,

687
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:23,320
the last time I saw him was in,

688
00:39:23,350 --> 00:39:26,290
he was in the main room and the comic
store and there was, I walked into the,

689
00:39:26,291 --> 00:39:31,291
to the back because there was rowers
and it was Tony Rocks and Tony Rock was

690
00:39:31,841 --> 00:39:35,490
murdering. I mean,
murdering where hall's, oof.

691
00:39:36,550 --> 00:39:38,350
Damn. You could hear it
in the hallway. That row,

692
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:42,120
that hallway roar when someone just
really hits a high note. I walked in like,

693
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:45,460
damn, no dude, everybody's always
talking about Tony Rock in the community.

694
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:47,410
I mean, he's, he's a
monster. Some monster.

695
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:50,530
I gotta check on me so much more famous
if he wasn't Chris Rock's brother.

696
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:55,120
But really you believe that 100%
he's, he's a fucking top 10 murderer.

697
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:58,240
I think that it's one of those things
that if your brother is one of the

698
00:39:58,241 --> 00:40:01,720
greatest comics of all
time, not just a great car,

699
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:06,130
like your brother's Chris Rock.
Yeah. N****s, which is black people.

700
00:40:06,131 --> 00:40:09,670
I mean everybody knows that, but
everybody knows that, but he,

701
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:14,020
he's one of the greats of all
time. If that's your brother. Oh,

702
00:40:14,021 --> 00:40:17,770
people don't want to pay attention to
it. You know, it's a weird thing, man.

703
00:40:17,771 --> 00:40:20,710
They just like, Hey, can you get me your
brother's number? You know what I mean?

704
00:40:20,711 --> 00:40:22,190
It's like the gift and the
curse though. Yeah. So,

705
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:24,880
but I'm Tony Rog and I killed
two. I'll probably kill, you know,

706
00:40:24,910 --> 00:40:28,390
Charlie used to have a been [inaudible]
Charlie used to have videos here he

707
00:40:28,391 --> 00:40:32,800
goes, they said, Charlie do get mad
at people yelling out Charlie Murphy,

708
00:40:33,250 --> 00:40:35,200
you know, cause everybody's
like Johnny Man. Hey,

709
00:40:35,201 --> 00:40:36,520
that was like a thing
people would do with them.

710
00:40:36,521 --> 00:40:38,260
If you're hanging out
with Charlie, he goes, no,

711
00:40:38,261 --> 00:40:40,720
I'm just glad they're not calling
me Eddie Murphy's brother anymore.

712
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:47,560
Imagine how Ray j feels. Yeah, man.
Brandy's brother. And you know,

713
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:52,360
you never saw the tape. I did.
Did you? You saw the tape? Yeah.

714
00:40:52,390 --> 00:40:55,530
Everybody had to see that. Yeah. It
was most watched TV. That's, yeah.

715
00:40:55,740 --> 00:40:59,530
It's super important.
Isn't pub culture star?

716
00:41:01,770 --> 00:41:06,700
You know, it's a, it's gotta be weird,

717
00:41:06,701 --> 00:41:09,910
man. To have someone like that,
that's a brother that's, uh,

718
00:41:10,050 --> 00:41:14,080
a person who's like, like if you're
Mike Tyson's brother, you know,

719
00:41:14,110 --> 00:41:16,180
real good heavyweight boxer, Tony Tyson,

720
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:19,210
and that'll be your Mike Tyson's
brother and you can like,

721
00:41:19,211 --> 00:41:22,930
I can knock out stu like,
Eh, like Mike Rowe. Yeah.

722
00:41:22,931 --> 00:41:25,270
He is judged at a totally
different standard,

723
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:27,910
but I don't think that's the
case with the Waynes brothers.

724
00:41:28,090 --> 00:41:31,000
The Waynes brothers is like generally
accepted that they're all really talented,

725
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:33,710
you know? Yeah. And they're,
yeah. They're all really good.

726
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:38,150
They're all super successful. Yeah. Yeah.
Kim Too. Yeah. All of them now. Yeah.

727
00:41:38,770 --> 00:41:42,870
Shawntay like, yeah. Damian, all those
crazy comedy family Craig. Yeah. Yeah.

728
00:41:42,871 --> 00:41:46,340
They're all just like, it's just, it's
in their DNA predisposed to being funny.

729
00:41:46,780 --> 00:41:49,100
Well, it's also like that's the
family business, which is, you know,

730
00:41:49,101 --> 00:41:52,970
some people they make boots,
right, where they cater, you know,

731
00:41:52,971 --> 00:41:55,900
or they want Delis. A man. I
was just in Italy like the,

732
00:41:55,940 --> 00:41:58,310
like when you see like these
little small family businesses,

733
00:41:58,311 --> 00:42:02,510
small family restaurants, like people
that work there, you know the likes.

734
00:42:02,570 --> 00:42:07,520
Like the father's the owner and the
daughter's the manager mom works in the

735
00:42:07,930 --> 00:42:11,350
kitchen. It's like, wow, this is crazy.
But they still do that. Businesses.

736
00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:13,430
Yeah, that was always a thing. Right?

737
00:42:13,530 --> 00:42:17,150
You remember like family businesses on
the east coast now it's like so rare that

738
00:42:17,151 --> 00:42:19,520
people, they wear it like
a badge of honor. Look,

739
00:42:19,521 --> 00:42:24,230
it's a family business to be family
businesses know that everything went

740
00:42:24,231 --> 00:42:26,150
corporate though. Yeah, man.

741
00:42:26,330 --> 00:42:28,520
There's certain places where
that's not the case though.

742
00:42:28,610 --> 00:42:31,370
Like you got to really appreciate because
one of the things you appreciate about

743
00:42:31,430 --> 00:42:35,240
going to Italy, there's this
like a bunch of little places.

744
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:36,560
I mean they have nice stores,

745
00:42:36,561 --> 00:42:39,800
like if you're in like Gucci Shit and
stuff like that. They have nice stores,

746
00:42:40,190 --> 00:42:43,610
but the restaurants and all the places
where you buy things, they're not like,

747
00:42:43,730 --> 00:42:46,940
they're like people shops, they're not
boutiques. They're just like, yeah,

748
00:42:46,941 --> 00:42:48,980
I go to, I go to Craig's or I go to, yeah,

749
00:42:49,590 --> 00:42:53,190
Tiffany skit or Walgreens or
you know, or Sears. It's not,

750
00:42:53,340 --> 00:42:58,250
there's no corporate to
to it. It's just families.

751
00:42:58,340 --> 00:43:01,100
It's weird. Like keeps the money in
the household. You know what I mean?

752
00:43:01,101 --> 00:43:04,640
That makes a real familial app
actually works out, but which isn't,

753
00:43:04,820 --> 00:43:06,920
that makes sense. And
that's also why I say like,

754
00:43:06,950 --> 00:43:10,250
I'm not real big into the reparations
talk for black people. I mean,

755
00:43:10,251 --> 00:43:12,440
I didn't really know the ins and
outs of it. People keep saying like,

756
00:43:12,441 --> 00:43:16,120
we needed get ready for Twitter.
Hey, I'm saying this. I'm saying,

757
00:43:17,110 --> 00:43:21,320
how about we incentivize parenting?
Hmm, okay, but can you do that?

758
00:43:21,950 --> 00:43:25,200
Let's keep, if if you're watching
your kids instead of like,

759
00:43:25,220 --> 00:43:28,610
they're just out there to me, like
let's say it's reparations. Talk about,

760
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:31,460
I don't know, infrastructure in black
communities. And if that's the case,

761
00:43:31,590 --> 00:43:33,950
well then let's incentivize
keeping the parents there,

762
00:43:33,951 --> 00:43:36,020
keeping the parents together,
or if they're split up,

763
00:43:36,021 --> 00:43:39,030
it's just like if you guys are teaching
your kid and he and he's in school every

764
00:43:39,031 --> 00:43:41,570
day or he survived, you know,
eight years of the school shooting,

765
00:43:42,290 --> 00:43:46,320
every family gets like, you know,
a big bonus, you know? Or if,

766
00:43:46,460 --> 00:43:48,680
if he makes the honor roll, you
know, like you guys get this,

767
00:43:48,681 --> 00:43:50,840
it's like you'd really be investing
in your investments like it take,

768
00:43:50,850 --> 00:43:53,180
they say it takes 18 years to make
back on your investment of your child.

769
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:56,270
If you're, if you're incentivizing
them to go to school for education,

770
00:43:56,750 --> 00:44:01,070
it's gonna make better people in a
better society. That seems good on paper.

771
00:44:01,071 --> 00:44:04,040
Now if you're seeing incentivize
like how to incentivize them, right?

772
00:44:04,041 --> 00:44:05,660
I'm saying like, oh,
it's good, it's all good.

773
00:44:05,661 --> 00:44:08,090
It's always good to encourage
people to be successful.

774
00:44:08,210 --> 00:44:11,500
So your kid test well on some of
these like aptitude tests, right?

775
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:14,210
Then you get a stipend or something
like that. I mean he's like, wait,

776
00:44:14,211 --> 00:44:16,460
what are these reparations we're
talking about? Exactly. Because exactly.

777
00:44:16,461 --> 00:44:17,720
I don't really know
the ins and outs of it,

778
00:44:17,721 --> 00:44:19,910
but if it's about infrastructure of
black communities, I'm so into it.

779
00:44:19,911 --> 00:44:22,930
But it's also, let's
incentivize, keep it, you know,

780
00:44:23,170 --> 00:44:25,610
that being in the child's life,
because for a lot of the upper,

781
00:44:25,611 --> 00:44:26,640
a lot of the reasons kids are like,

782
00:44:26,670 --> 00:44:28,790
they're depressed and they feel like they
have a chip on their shoulder because

783
00:44:28,791 --> 00:44:31,760
nobody's home watching them and they go
to these gangs. Did they go deal with

784
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:35,310
these other things right now because
they're just not being watched. Right.

785
00:44:35,470 --> 00:44:40,470
But I think the idea behind reparations
is that some people at one point in time

786
00:44:41,010 --> 00:44:43,080
were profiting off of slavery.

787
00:44:43,140 --> 00:44:47,340
Those people have used that money and
that money is become a part of really

788
00:44:47,370 --> 00:44:51,660
large businesses. Many, many large
businesses taking from businesses. Well,

789
00:44:51,661 --> 00:44:54,790
that's where reparations would have
to come from in my house. Yeah. Yeah.

790
00:44:54,990 --> 00:44:57,210
General Electric. Fucking give me $1,500.

791
00:44:57,240 --> 00:45:01,680
That's one that I think directly
should be like, you have to wonder,

792
00:45:01,681 --> 00:45:05,670
like if you made, like what
have you used to sell babies,

793
00:45:06,470 --> 00:45:10,080
right? And you had a baby selling
business, you sold babies, right?

794
00:45:10,980 --> 00:45:12,570
And then uh, your,

795
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:16,890
your grandson inherited all
your money from selling babies,

796
00:45:17,220 --> 00:45:19,380
but the grandson is
cool. I mean he just, uh,

797
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:22,650
he goes coffin and he's not
criminal or it's fine, it's fine.

798
00:45:22,860 --> 00:45:27,520
But is it fine because didn't his money
come from babies? Helen, where's it,

799
00:45:27,750 --> 00:45:31,260
where, wait a minute, let's trace this
money. Like here's, it started out,

800
00:45:31,290 --> 00:45:35,490
it was this much money and then your
dad got that and then his dad got that.

801
00:45:35,700 --> 00:45:38,100
And then like how many generations?

802
00:45:38,940 --> 00:45:42,630
So you're saying that families who are
known plantation owners should have to

803
00:45:42,631 --> 00:45:45,030
pay that money back to the black
community. Where did it go?

804
00:45:45,270 --> 00:45:47,900
Where'd the money go? What was
he used for? No, you're right.

805
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:52,940
A hundred years ago. It's 1865.
Okay. It's not that long ago.

806
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:57,470
It's so recent to anybody that's on the
census that says they're black. Right?

807
00:45:57,990 --> 00:46:02,100
Like an 8%. If I'm 80% black, I'm going
to get how much of this, you know,

808
00:46:02,310 --> 00:46:05,160
the Jones plantation, you know,
fortune. I'm not saying that.

809
00:46:05,190 --> 00:46:06,750
I'm saying that what the,

810
00:46:06,810 --> 00:46:10,650
the smart thing to do would to
be to figure out what damage was.

811
00:46:10,690 --> 00:46:15,480
Like if they really objectively looked
at what damage was done to communities

812
00:46:15,481 --> 00:46:19,530
where slavery existed for,

813
00:46:19,750 --> 00:46:24,750
I mean how many hundreds of years in
this country before it was 400 years.

814
00:46:25,380 --> 00:46:27,090
Hundreds of years. Right.

815
00:46:27,270 --> 00:46:31,290
And then it ends and then these people
live in these cities and they're

816
00:46:31,291 --> 00:46:34,890
discriminated against and they're locked
up. They would, they would sort of,

817
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:38,680
one thing that I learned about who
was telling us about this, that they,

818
00:46:38,740 --> 00:46:43,740
they would disproportionately arrest
glowed man [inaudible] them the worst air

819
00:46:44,371 --> 00:46:45,420
for black people in America.

820
00:46:45,421 --> 00:46:48,330
It's not so much slavery as it is the
reconstruction air because then people are

821
00:46:48,331 --> 00:46:51,840
just mad that black people are here.
Yeah. But they were also arresting them.

822
00:46:52,470 --> 00:46:56,580
Small crimes and making them work
in prison. Kidnapping people. Yeah.

823
00:46:56,581 --> 00:47:00,120
Megan indentured servants. You become,
it's just another form of slavery.

824
00:47:00,121 --> 00:47:02,850
It's like through his weird loophole,
like you could make you a slave again.

825
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:06,000
We just arrest you for hanging out in
the street and then we put you in this

826
00:47:06,001 --> 00:47:08,430
factory. And you have to do
this for us and make nothing.

827
00:47:09,080 --> 00:47:10,780
And it's basically the
same thing as slave,

828
00:47:10,890 --> 00:47:14,340
but when you find out what they make
in prisons, when you go, wait a minute,

829
00:47:14,510 --> 00:47:17,280
they, they work for like 13 cents a
day or whatever the fuck they get.

830
00:47:17,730 --> 00:47:20,940
Like what they figured out how to,
yeah, they're modernizing slavery. Yeah,

831
00:47:20,941 --> 00:47:24,780
because somehow or another that's okay
because we've got them locked in a box.

832
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:27,180
Like they're supposed
to be punished. Right.

833
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:29,860
They're supposed to be rehabilitated
and take it off the street,

834
00:47:29,861 --> 00:47:33,700
but we're going to make them work for
no money. I know white man is so smart.

835
00:47:33,730 --> 00:47:36,340
Why don't we like black guys? We got
to start making white guys work for us.

836
00:47:36,670 --> 00:47:39,670
Why don't we do the same thing?
We're just a smart, well,

837
00:47:40,030 --> 00:47:45,030
those all the areas that were affected
by that in the fifties and sixties

838
00:47:45,580 --> 00:47:49,450
there's a residual effect
that is never been addressed.

839
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:51,250
Like the government has never said,

840
00:47:51,251 --> 00:47:54,550
we've got to figure out how to make
these spots better because the reason why

841
00:47:54,551 --> 00:47:58,900
they're so fucked up is because slavery
was there and then the subsequent,

842
00:47:59,600 --> 00:47:59,890
yeah,

843
00:47:59,890 --> 00:48:04,890
the race riots of the 60s and the this
quest to to figure out what to do with

844
00:48:08,561 --> 00:48:11,860
those sort of stopped short.
There's not like a like,

845
00:48:11,890 --> 00:48:14,020
like Baltimore and places like that,

846
00:48:14,021 --> 00:48:17,920
like Detroit south side Chicago
were just murdered every year.

847
00:48:17,921 --> 00:48:22,120
We just accept that the numbers,
high numbers of murder. Right.

848
00:48:22,700 --> 00:48:23,590
Is West side of Chicago,

849
00:48:23,591 --> 00:48:27,820
is that where it all goes down
there just really poor areas,

850
00:48:29,350 --> 00:48:33,580
but it's also like how did these guys
getting guns yet if you can drive around,

851
00:48:33,581 --> 00:48:37,330
you can get a gun and that's
another, yeah, I just don't know.

852
00:48:37,530 --> 00:48:39,910
Like you have money for guns, but
you'd have money to like, I don't know,

853
00:48:39,911 --> 00:48:41,230
you know, get a backpack and go to school.

854
00:48:41,450 --> 00:48:43,810
Well also if you see that
around you all the time,

855
00:48:43,811 --> 00:48:47,650
the problem is you become a part of
that world. If everyone's Kinda gun,

856
00:48:47,651 --> 00:48:51,490
never been shooting at everybody and
don't know, you better get one better.

857
00:48:51,491 --> 00:48:54,310
Get a fucking gun, I'm going to try to
shoot at you. You got to shoot back.

858
00:48:54,580 --> 00:48:57,790
Like what? Like they're still shooting
like, yeah, you live in a war zone, bro.

859
00:48:57,791 --> 00:49:00,670
Go get the gun. That's what
it is. It's an it just like,

860
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:05,671
it's not a war zone in terms of like
it's official resume declaration by the

861
00:49:06,011 --> 00:49:08,980
government, but it's a war
zone. These are undeclared wars.

862
00:49:09,730 --> 00:49:12,460
People are shooting at each other that's
say, yeah, they're warring each other.

863
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:16,160
[inaudible] and McCoy is a, it's
a war. It's a civil war. This is,

864
00:49:16,161 --> 00:49:20,980
it's like warring tribes. If we have
that in fucking Siberia right now,

865
00:49:20,981 --> 00:49:23,920
I bet. I bet the Siberian
gang fights. Yeah,

866
00:49:23,921 --> 00:49:26,110
but that's also the to every
best depression and that's,

867
00:49:26,170 --> 00:49:27,400
that's another thing classism does.

868
00:49:27,401 --> 00:49:31,540
It's like they're telling you to kill
yourself because you're just poor and you

869
00:49:31,541 --> 00:49:34,510
don't know what to do. And it's
like, but that's not true. I mean,

870
00:49:35,980 --> 00:49:38,100
I'm a black guy like you guys. And I
got, I got family members who were,

871
00:49:38,170 --> 00:49:40,010
you know, in gangs like that
and it sucks down there.

872
00:49:40,030 --> 00:49:42,520
They're so depressed
because they, what they say?

873
00:49:42,530 --> 00:49:46,780
They don't know how to get out of it
and you don't see any pathway and they

874
00:49:46,781 --> 00:49:49,990
don't see anybody who's gotten out of
it, so they feel like they're stuck.

875
00:49:50,230 --> 00:49:53,380
There's a lot of kids that grow up in
bad situations. They feel inferior.

876
00:49:53,890 --> 00:49:55,630
Exactly. And yeah,

877
00:49:55,631 --> 00:49:58,660
they feel inferior because of the
clothes they wear or how much money their

878
00:49:58,661 --> 00:50:02,680
family has or within. How do you
empower those parents through,

879
00:50:02,710 --> 00:50:04,390
I think through activities.

880
00:50:05,170 --> 00:50:09,400
I think I'm getting those kids involved
in things that they can get good at,

881
00:50:09,430 --> 00:50:14,430
that show that they have value and
that with hard work comes rewards.

882
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:15,011
I mean,

883
00:50:15,011 --> 00:50:18,490
some of the greatest success stories in
this country are professional athletes

884
00:50:18,491 --> 00:50:22,810
coming out of impoverished neighborhoods
and they become these global superstar,

885
00:50:22,811 --> 00:50:24,850
but then they stay in there, but then
they stay in their kids' lives though,

886
00:50:24,851 --> 00:50:28,170
don't they? Some of them do,
yeah. I mean, they're still there,

887
00:50:28,250 --> 00:50:32,810
but it's like you can't, you
can't fix all that's taken place.

888
00:50:33,270 --> 00:50:35,570
No, you have to sort of figure out how to,

889
00:50:35,660 --> 00:50:39,320
how to improve the way
people look at life,

890
00:50:39,350 --> 00:50:43,520
the way people interface with life. It's
very hard if you're trying to do that,

891
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:48,080
but all around you as violence and crime
and fear and your cortisol levels are

892
00:50:48,081 --> 00:50:50,420
all jacked up because
you're in the hood and that,

893
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:55,960
that's not been addressed like a
serious health problem in this country.

894
00:50:56,661 --> 00:50:59,830
This like even an infrastructure problem.
We just sort of accept the fact is,

895
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:01,850
and this is your problem, so if
we're going to put money back,

896
00:51:01,940 --> 00:51:04,610
if we're going to operate, if we're
going to repair these black communities,

897
00:51:04,820 --> 00:51:05,750
put money in the infrastructure,

898
00:51:05,751 --> 00:51:09,050
but also you've got incentives to
incentivize parents to be there.

899
00:51:09,380 --> 00:51:10,340
I think it's a good idea.

900
00:51:10,340 --> 00:51:12,890
I like what you're saying because
you're not punishing them. No,

901
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:16,190
just incentivize. I'm not saying like
we shouldn't get money, you know,

902
00:51:16,191 --> 00:51:16,881
just for being black.

903
00:51:16,881 --> 00:51:20,660
I'm saying we got to keep the parents
there because that's what builds a strong

904
00:51:20,661 --> 00:51:22,220
community. It really does. You know,

905
00:51:22,250 --> 00:51:26,930
I don't know a whole lot about common
law Harris, but, uh, I do know that, um,

906
00:51:26,990 --> 00:51:30,410
you know, she's a very
powerful, well-spoken lady,

907
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:34,370
but she was talking once about this
thing that they did where they had these

908
00:51:35,180 --> 00:51:36,460
parents, um,

909
00:51:36,860 --> 00:51:41,360
be responsible for their kids
truancy and so they could go to jail.

910
00:51:41,450 --> 00:51:46,310
Like the idea was, I make sure this
is correct. Make sure is correct,

911
00:51:46,311 --> 00:51:49,750
Jamie, because I think the thing
they were saying was they were,

912
00:51:49,900 --> 00:51:54,170
they were gonna they would have cops
go to visit when a kid would had been

913
00:51:54,190 --> 00:51:55,090
truant. Okay.

914
00:51:55,490 --> 00:51:59,810
And they would sort of threaten the
mother that she's responsible for the

915
00:51:59,811 --> 00:52:02,690
child's truancy. The mother
is not the father. Well,

916
00:52:02,691 --> 00:52:05,660
whoever was there a single
mother in this case of this one,

917
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:10,730
one case they were talking
about specifically and that
this lady had to figure

918
00:52:10,731 --> 00:52:13,770
out a way to get her fucking son
to show up at school. Hey, I'm,

919
00:52:13,820 --> 00:52:18,680
I could go to jail, you know, and
did it work? I'm sure it worked,

920
00:52:18,681 --> 00:52:21,290
right? I'm sure everyone
was probably terrified.

921
00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:24,500
But is that really what
we want in America?

922
00:52:24,770 --> 00:52:28,370
We want people to be scared that you
might go to jail if your kid doesn't go to

923
00:52:28,371 --> 00:52:30,380
school. So if the kid
doesn't go to school,

924
00:52:30,381 --> 00:52:34,570
you're going to lock someone in a
cage that is so threatening. Yeah.

925
00:52:34,840 --> 00:52:36,800
Cause that's also homeschool.
You know what I mean?

926
00:52:36,801 --> 00:52:38,320
I mean just cause he's enrolled.
It's almost like, you know,

927
00:52:38,340 --> 00:52:41,000
maybe I took a sick day, but if
you want to do homeschooling thing,

928
00:52:41,001 --> 00:52:43,580
I think you have to fill out
paperwork. You apply for it.

929
00:52:43,810 --> 00:52:45,560
They'll have to let them know
that you're withdrawing your test.

930
00:52:45,650 --> 00:52:48,620
And the school says, I think, but
how many trophies is this? Is this,

931
00:52:48,621 --> 00:52:50,930
this first one? I don't know how you
know your first time offender camera.

932
00:52:51,090 --> 00:52:54,140
It was a hundred someone saying they're
gonna lock you in jail cause your kid

933
00:52:54,141 --> 00:52:57,610
doesn't go to school. That's
bananas. That's bananas like you,

934
00:52:58,190 --> 00:53:01,160
he's 16 or whatever the
fuck. It's like when are you,

935
00:53:01,161 --> 00:53:02,200
when you were 16 you were free.

936
00:53:02,210 --> 00:53:05,610
Like I was a latchkey kid
when I was 14 I was out gone.

937
00:53:05,690 --> 00:53:09,320
We lived in different time though, Joe.
I know Bruno. We had to sue genders,

938
00:53:09,321 --> 00:53:12,470
you know, racist race. You
know, it's different for us.

939
00:53:13,120 --> 00:53:17,090
It's that the only thing that bothers
me does that just drives me crazy. The,

940
00:53:17,091 --> 00:53:18,710
the, the, the idea of like,

941
00:53:18,740 --> 00:53:22,040
the way you fix things is by
scaring people and locking them.

942
00:53:22,230 --> 00:53:26,280
That's how religion gulags start, man.
That's, that's really, that's how,

943
00:53:26,370 --> 00:53:31,370
that's how the Soviet Union becomes this
really fucking empire of authoritarian

944
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:35,780
regime. Let's up the,

945
00:53:36,730 --> 00:53:41,230
the jail sentences of some parents
in multiple counties were in quotes,

946
00:53:41,260 --> 00:53:44,380
what she said, an unintended
consequence of a statewide law.

947
00:53:44,830 --> 00:53:46,820
But I'm looking further into this and uh,

948
00:53:47,230 --> 00:53:48,970
this says this is from Los Angeles time.

949
00:53:49,030 --> 00:53:52,420
What was that speech actually that
she gave where she explained how she,

950
00:53:52,500 --> 00:53:57,100
how she did it and how it was effective.
She was hard on people being truant.

951
00:53:57,580 --> 00:53:59,380
I think your idea, what my point was,

952
00:53:59,381 --> 00:54:02,980
I think that your idea is better because
instead of punishing people for not

953
00:54:02,981 --> 00:54:07,060
doing, it incentivizes them for
doing it. And if you could set aside,

954
00:54:07,360 --> 00:54:08,890
imagine that as a project, right?

955
00:54:08,891 --> 00:54:12,610
You were saying that like it takes 18
years to see if we could fund an 18 year

956
00:54:12,611 --> 00:54:17,140
project where they were doing that and
just incentivizing kids to succeed and

957
00:54:17,141 --> 00:54:19,340
all of a sudden they can just
start succeeding like crazy.

958
00:54:19,720 --> 00:54:23,130
Like what if we had a big jump
because it was like financially vital,

959
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:25,720
like you're competing
for what's a great idea.

960
00:54:26,170 --> 00:54:28,750
It's a great competing look
for money you like, by the way,

961
00:54:28,751 --> 00:54:31,780
look at all these guys who could get
popped in a in college for like taking,

962
00:54:31,810 --> 00:54:32,643
you know, incentives.

963
00:54:32,670 --> 00:54:36,160
It's like it's because they're getting
their parents jobs or homes or cars.

964
00:54:36,250 --> 00:54:39,100
There's another form. There's
another form. I know what I mean.

965
00:54:39,160 --> 00:54:44,080
College athletes who's getting
fucked harder than college athletes.

966
00:54:44,110 --> 00:54:46,240
Exactly. Who's getting fucked harder than,

967
00:54:46,390 --> 00:54:50,230
the only thing that's
interesting about the,

968
00:54:50,231 --> 00:54:53,350
I mean literally only thing that's
interesting about the event is to athletes

969
00:54:53,351 --> 00:54:57,010
performing. That's it. And
they make own gods. They make,

970
00:54:57,011 --> 00:54:59,100
not that they're getting
to 40 grand scholarship.

971
00:54:59,540 --> 00:55:01,380
I'll give you the opportunity
to perform you right.

972
00:55:01,430 --> 00:55:05,140
The way that everybody gets here, like
get an electrical engineering degree.

973
00:55:05,170 --> 00:55:07,630
Like everybody wants me. What are
you talking about? I'm like, God,

974
00:55:07,631 --> 00:55:11,170
look at this. 2016 2017 school year,

975
00:55:11,171 --> 00:55:16,171
the NCAA revenue reached 1 billion with
a B $1 billion and they're a nonprofit,

976
00:55:17,531 --> 00:55:22,170
right? Athletes get one gots to get
paid to organize this sports defense.

977
00:55:22,460 --> 00:55:26,590
Really Click on that link. It
says, Eh, NCAA sports make one.

978
00:55:26,770 --> 00:55:30,280
That's that business insiders,
that's one of them. Real quick.

979
00:55:30,790 --> 00:55:33,580
Baity is that like a, is
it or is it a real legit,

980
00:55:33,650 --> 00:55:35,110
you just got to figure
out who wrote the article,

981
00:55:35,140 --> 00:55:37,540
but it's also like what California is
like. Did they put on a bill? Right?

982
00:55:37,541 --> 00:55:39,460
They're going to pay the
athletes for their likeness.

983
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:44,260
They should pay him to play Chopin
play. What are the three schools?

984
00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:46,210
I think those people
in the audience would,

985
00:55:46,211 --> 00:55:48,010
they pay for the pay for entertainment.

986
00:55:48,220 --> 00:55:50,560
They're paying to watch the entertainment
depending on watch the game.

987
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:54,820
So how come the players don't get a
piece? Right? Why don't they do it?

988
00:55:54,910 --> 00:55:56,830
But it's like [inaudible]
it says my name on the back,

989
00:55:56,940 --> 00:55:59,470
like why can't I get just like a piece
of that? The idea is that it's not fair.

990
00:55:59,480 --> 00:56:01,750
No one else gets anything for
anything they do in school.

991
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:04,630
But that's you're stealing from athletes.

992
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:07,510
You're professional cause you're getting
paid for your, for your craft. No.

993
00:56:07,540 --> 00:56:10,840
Well then if it's going to be the
athletes going to work for free,

994
00:56:10,841 --> 00:56:14,020
the fucking show should be
free. It should be free tickets.

995
00:56:15,740 --> 00:56:18,940
[inaudible] just broke the Internet.
That's what it should be like. Oh, okay.

996
00:56:19,020 --> 00:56:20,740
We don't get any money. Well,
you don't get any money either.

997
00:56:20,830 --> 00:56:22,600
We're doing it for fun or
you're doing it for fun.

998
00:56:23,110 --> 00:56:24,070
What do we need to have games?

999
00:56:24,190 --> 00:56:26,890
We're free. Yeah. Holy Shit.
That's how it should be.

1000
00:56:26,891 --> 00:56:28,690
You don't want to pay me
free. Everything's free.

1001
00:56:28,750 --> 00:56:32,560
You can't charge money and keep it all
you greedy. That'd be the worst audience.

1002
00:56:32,561 --> 00:56:36,210
By the way. The free audience is the
worst audience don't want, you know,

1003
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:39,940
the weird thing about colleges is the
dudes who have graduated and they're rich

1004
00:56:39,941 --> 00:56:43,450
now and they did. They donate money.
Keep that football program alive.

1005
00:56:44,170 --> 00:56:47,370
They give you a fucking status thing
in their community player. Love it.

1006
00:56:47,590 --> 00:56:52,360
Like Jamie loves Columbus teams. Anything
from Columbus, he gets a boner for,

1007
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:55,480
he gets super [inaudible]. Oh wait,

1008
00:56:55,481 --> 00:56:57,760
from this one watching
the basketball tournament,

1009
00:56:57,900 --> 00:56:59,800
there's stuff going on at Ohio
state with the Epstein Shit.

1010
00:56:59,801 --> 00:57:02,650
They've invested a lot of money at Ohio
state and they're trying to figure out

1011
00:57:02,651 --> 00:57:05,770
if they need to give it back or not
only did he go to Ohio state, he didn't,

1012
00:57:05,771 --> 00:57:08,860
but he's involved in Columbus business
and so they have given a lot of money to

1013
00:57:08,861 --> 00:57:13,600
this football team. And have they
determined that his, um, that his money,

1014
00:57:13,601 --> 00:57:16,660
like how his money was made
through sex trafficking,

1015
00:57:18,300 --> 00:57:20,710
like Epstein's money? Yeah.
I don't know. I don't know.

1016
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:24,220
I mean I know he's managing that one guys.
I mean how much from sex trafficking?

1017
00:57:24,221 --> 00:57:28,300
Cause I thought man, that would make
him a plantation owner, like in a sense,

1018
00:57:28,301 --> 00:57:30,490
right. Because he's like,
he's given up flesh. He's get,

1019
00:57:30,491 --> 00:57:35,410
he's getting paid for flush.
[inaudible] what was his, is allegedly,

1020
00:57:35,411 --> 00:57:39,720
what he did was he would find young girls
and get them to give them massages and

1021
00:57:39,730 --> 00:57:44,650
they'd be like, you guys should, you
know yeah. Getting my tribe. Yeah.

1022
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:47,150
The prosecutor and I were like, oh man.

1023
00:57:48,330 --> 00:57:50,380
[inaudible] a real creepy
way of describing it too.

1024
00:57:50,740 --> 00:57:55,120
He said that he thought it was
impossible for him to control that his,

1025
00:57:55,121 --> 00:57:58,630
his impulses were impossible for him to
control and he was a great flight risk.

1026
00:57:58,980 --> 00:58:01,570
So he didn't want him to
have um, chief, that's true.

1027
00:58:01,600 --> 00:58:02,920
So his therapist was saying this,

1028
00:58:02,980 --> 00:58:05,800
so they're trying to protect him but it's
also like are they trying to cure him?

1029
00:58:05,910 --> 00:58:08,620
I think see if that quote is true
cause uh, I'm pretty high right now.

1030
00:58:09,790 --> 00:58:12,340
The prosecutor said that he uh,

1031
00:58:12,490 --> 00:58:17,470
Dyson that the Epstein fellow had 'em
impulses that were impossible to control

1032
00:58:18,990 --> 00:58:21,520
that that's how he felt. But a lot
of those guys, I say that right.

1033
00:58:21,521 --> 00:58:25,720
Even like the Jared and all the guys
say that that's a thing apparently about

1034
00:58:25,721 --> 00:58:30,040
pedophiles is that the recidivism
rates so high when they get,

1035
00:58:30,070 --> 00:58:33,370
if they do go to jail and then they
get released, boy man they do it again.

1036
00:58:33,830 --> 00:58:36,460
Cause like I got away. I can do
that. I can deal with this. Dan,

1037
00:58:36,461 --> 00:58:39,510
I think they're broken. I
think it's like a, like,

1038
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:42,970
you know that screen that was just all
fucked up and that's them. It's a glitch.

1039
00:58:42,971 --> 00:58:47,800
Yeah. I think, I don't think we
should assume that, you know, if you,

1040
00:58:47,801 --> 00:58:50,090
if your brain is working well
when your body's working well,

1041
00:58:50,091 --> 00:58:52,610
you just can't assume that everybody's
is. And I think some people,

1042
00:58:52,760 --> 00:58:55,780
but there's also like, you feel bad for
it. I mean, like we feel guys who like,

1043
00:58:55,781 --> 00:58:58,360
who are born with maybe like
severe cerebral palsy, right?

1044
00:58:58,361 --> 00:59:00,530
Like in a sense that's what's
happening to them. You know, like they,

1045
00:59:00,531 --> 00:59:02,140
they can't control this
urge, but then it's also,

1046
00:59:02,141 --> 00:59:05,920
how do you fix that instead of like
shaming them right in. And a lot of it is,

1047
00:59:05,921 --> 00:59:10,540
apparently a lot of pedophilia is brought
from through sexual trauma, right?

1048
00:59:10,541 --> 00:59:14,170
So if someone is molested
as a young child,

1049
00:59:14,171 --> 00:59:17,650
apparently there's a high likelihood
that they're going to do it.

1050
00:59:17,880 --> 00:59:22,240
Their likelihood rather, that they
can. So it's like the HIV virus, it's,

1051
00:59:22,340 --> 00:59:26,150
it's just you're, you're
breaking someone's wiring,

1052
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:29,990
like the wiring to the way they
interface with the world as a young age,

1053
00:59:30,050 --> 00:59:33,020
at a young age. And you're fucking
up their life in a horrible way.

1054
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:34,640
And they say that about Michael
Jackson. Right. He's like,

1055
00:59:34,641 --> 00:59:38,120
he got touched earlier. Then it was
like he just, he was using that as like,

1056
00:59:38,121 --> 00:59:42,950
Hey, I, this is, this is normal to me.
Why did he ever allege happened to him?

1057
00:59:42,980 --> 00:59:45,620
Did he ever explain what
happened to him? No.

1058
00:59:45,730 --> 00:59:49,130
There was something where he was talking
about how he had all the surgeries so

1059
00:59:49,131 --> 00:59:52,910
he didn't have to look like his
father. I remember that. Really? Yeah.

1060
00:59:52,970 --> 00:59:56,420
But that's also, it could also be that.
So he was scared of his father. Yeah.

1061
00:59:56,450 --> 00:59:59,060
And every time I look in the mirror, he
saw his father. Yeah. Man in the mirror.

1062
00:59:59,120 --> 01:00:01,490
Yeah. And look, that's what it's about.

1063
01:00:01,610 --> 01:00:03,740
I don't think that it's
not about show shit.

1064
01:00:04,050 --> 01:00:08,900
It's about getting your shit
together. They also say,

1065
01:00:08,930 --> 01:00:12,980
they also say because he
bought the Beatles catalog
that that's a smear campaign

1066
01:00:12,981 --> 01:00:15,770
and like they pay those kids off to
say that about them. That's ridiculous.

1067
01:00:16,510 --> 01:00:21,440
It's a great conspiracy theory.
I think people are, um, you know,

1068
01:00:22,010 --> 01:00:27,010
they're crazy if they think it's normal
for a guy to have a bunch of kids sleep

1069
01:00:27,151 --> 01:00:30,800
in his bed. And he was weird.
You know my cousin drugs that is

1070
01:00:32,360 --> 01:00:33,560
off the charts.

1071
01:00:33,590 --> 01:00:37,670
Bananas that anybody would let their
kids stay there off the charts. Bananas.

1072
01:00:37,700 --> 01:00:41,960
It is also, Mike was off the charts. Yeah.

1073
01:00:41,980 --> 01:00:44,690
I mean he had so many hits.
The more hits you have,

1074
01:00:44,691 --> 01:00:48,130
the more shit you can get away
with until we didn't. Okay.

1075
01:00:48,140 --> 01:00:52,580
Berman's dis dismissed the request for
bail because Epstein's impulses are not

1076
01:00:52,581 --> 01:00:57,410
likely to have abated or been successfully
suppressed. That's not exactly,

1077
01:00:57,411 --> 01:01:01,280
I definitely, that makes more
sense. I paraphrased hard.

1078
01:01:01,530 --> 01:01:03,950
That's how things get Florida
guns. How rumors get started.

1079
01:01:04,190 --> 01:01:05,960
So this is in Florida. You can
get away with anything there.

1080
01:01:06,380 --> 01:01:08,750
He used to be able to either tighten
it down on Florida. Thank God.

1081
01:01:10,100 --> 01:01:13,580
What the fuck? Florida 2019
it took you this long. Well,

1082
01:01:13,581 --> 01:01:16,820
Florida was the place where the pain
pill mills existed with the have the

1083
01:01:16,821 --> 01:01:17,810
management centers,

1084
01:01:17,811 --> 01:01:21,210
the pain management centers right
next to an oxycontin store too.

1085
01:01:21,290 --> 01:01:25,280
So you go to the doctor. It's just my
back's killing me. The doctor's like,

1086
01:01:25,281 --> 01:01:29,150
you need pain pills. I do need pain
pills and just write a piece of paper.

1087
01:01:29,151 --> 01:01:31,340
And then you would literally
go to the next door over,

1088
01:01:31,670 --> 01:01:35,330
and it was the building connected
to them that sells the pain pills.

1089
01:01:35,331 --> 01:01:38,300
They'd have it in the same spot. Sometimes
it's just like cocaine country too,

1090
01:01:38,301 --> 01:01:42,070
right? Yeah. Everybody's so fucking
high in Florida. Oh Dude, Florida.

1091
01:01:42,170 --> 01:01:46,790
It's crazy. It's crazy. It's got a
history of high. I feel like the,

1092
01:01:46,820 --> 01:01:51,820
the chaos of the 80s of all the cocaine
is burned into the psyche of the

1093
01:01:52,071 --> 01:01:56,120
landmass. And then the alligators moved
in and made it even more reptilian.

1094
01:01:56,450 --> 01:01:59,150
Cause if I was a kid that was made
up more reptilian when I was a kid,

1095
01:01:59,151 --> 01:02:02,000
I lived there. I lived in
Israel, I lived in Gainesville,

1096
01:02:02,810 --> 01:02:06,410
Gainesville north. I don't
know if it's nor is it north,

1097
01:02:06,440 --> 01:02:08,890
sort of [inaudible] medalist,
but in the middle. Okay.

1098
01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:12,920
I mean we were around alligators,
but they were endangered back then.

1099
01:02:13,280 --> 01:02:16,160
So they would tell her, yeah, they
thought of them as endangered.

1100
01:02:16,161 --> 01:02:17,600
People are so silly. They're like,

1101
01:02:17,601 --> 01:02:20,700
we have to protect these fucking
that are around us. We have to.

1102
01:02:21,060 --> 01:02:24,030
And when I was there, uh, some
ladies poodle got snatched.

1103
01:02:24,031 --> 01:02:24,750
I think it was a poodle.

1104
01:02:24,750 --> 01:02:29,610
It was a small dog got snatched by
an alligator while I was there. Yeah.

1105
01:02:29,700 --> 01:02:31,170
Yeah. I didn't see it happen,

1106
01:02:31,171 --> 01:02:35,160
but I came like after it happened and
people were all freaked out and uh,

1107
01:02:35,220 --> 01:02:38,380
they were, uh, telling you to
stop feeding the marshmallow.

1108
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:41,070
We would feed alligators marshmallow
and they'd keep coming back. Well,

1109
01:02:41,071 --> 01:02:43,290
the thing is they would, they
liked the marshmallows like,

1110
01:02:43,291 --> 01:02:45,960
so you knew if you threw the marshmallows,
the alligator come up and eat it.

1111
01:02:46,380 --> 01:02:49,660
And uh, they got used to eating
marshmallows and then there was signs,

1112
01:02:49,680 --> 01:02:49,951
they said,

1113
01:02:49,951 --> 01:02:53,040
don't have the alligators eat marshmallows
because it's apparently bad for the

1114
01:02:53,041 --> 01:02:55,890
digestive system and blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah. Like a shit everywhere.

1115
01:02:56,340 --> 01:02:58,890
Your mother can eat a
whole dog with Colorado.

1116
01:03:00,020 --> 01:03:02,370
That's better for that judges
there. They, yeah, I mean,

1117
01:03:02,371 --> 01:03:07,290
it's not digested the dog's collar.
It's swallowing that collar.

1118
01:03:07,290 --> 01:03:10,110
It's gonna shit out
that metal buckle. Ugh.

1119
01:03:10,170 --> 01:03:12,270
You really think I'm
marshmallows going to start.

1120
01:03:12,271 --> 01:03:16,830
And so this attitude that they had that
they wanted to bring back the alligator,

1121
01:03:17,460 --> 01:03:20,850
it was a good thing. Cause you know they
really were on the verge of extinction,

1122
01:03:21,270 --> 01:03:25,200
but then it became the opposite.
So now alligators are everywhere.

1123
01:03:25,410 --> 01:03:28,740
So now like alligators, people
find them in their house,

1124
01:03:29,160 --> 01:03:32,340
they find them in their pool.
Like they're snatching people up

1125
01:03:34,200 --> 01:03:36,810
like red some New York or they're
everywhere. And they're so,

1126
01:03:36,870 --> 01:03:40,770
did you see that one that was really
recently filmed walking across a golf

1127
01:03:40,771 --> 01:03:44,040
course? No, it is a dinosaur.

1128
01:03:44,520 --> 01:03:48,210
15 feet long. I do love the gator though.

1129
01:03:49,130 --> 01:03:52,710
I fucking love it. Really.
It's an awesome animal.

1130
01:03:52,980 --> 01:03:56,850
See if you could find the video, the
video of the giant alligator they,

1131
01:03:56,851 --> 01:03:57,750
and they said, by the way,

1132
01:03:57,751 --> 01:04:02,751
that this alligator is probably somewhere
in the neighborhood of 80 years old.

1133
01:04:03,960 --> 01:04:08,220
He's 80 years old looking at zero 80
years. That's an eight year old alligator.

1134
01:04:09,120 --> 01:04:12,270
God, he never experienced any
kind of racism or Jim Crow laws.

1135
01:04:14,130 --> 01:04:19,050
They're just walking through
[inaudible] machine, you know,

1136
01:04:19,560 --> 01:04:23,880
good for. But here it is. Look
at this. Oh Shit. You were alone.

1137
01:04:23,910 --> 01:04:27,750
Oh my God. Oh, he's 80 years old.
That's an 80 year old alligator.

1138
01:04:28,020 --> 01:04:31,290
He's moving kind of fresh. They'd
say the ones that are really big,

1139
01:04:31,470 --> 01:04:34,560
when they get to be that
like 15 foot length, he goes,

1140
01:04:34,561 --> 01:04:38,820
a lot of those are really old.
50 60 no arthritis. I mean God,

1141
01:04:38,860 --> 01:04:43,410
my friend shot one and it was more than
80 years old. Shout out to John Dudley

1142
01:04:45,880 --> 01:04:50,310
as a dinosaur. As a Goddamn
Blauer that means that is,

1143
01:04:50,330 --> 01:04:52,620
rewind that again because
we're both super high.

1144
01:04:52,920 --> 01:04:55,320
I mean that what is even doing mansion,

1145
01:04:55,680 --> 01:04:58,320
seeing that Brian Moses are
in your yard, you're chilling,

1146
01:04:58,440 --> 01:04:59,550
hanging out on your phone,

1147
01:04:59,720 --> 01:05:02,460
get your feet up and you see
that walking across your yard.

1148
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:06,510
And I gotta get the fuck out of Florida
and be like, how close is that to me?

1149
01:05:06,810 --> 01:05:09,900
What the fuck? I mean that's,
it's super dope. Look,

1150
01:05:09,901 --> 01:05:11,970
I mean look at that thing and
he's got a scab there too.

1151
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:16,020
How much do you think that
weighs? Let's go half a ton.

1152
01:05:16,530 --> 01:05:18,040
500 I

1153
01:05:18,040 --> 01:05:22,540
think a thousand. Easy. Cause you see
the guys fishing and the ones I am,

1154
01:05:22,810 --> 01:05:24,970
he's real in a big ass
fish. And the gator.

1155
01:05:24,971 --> 01:05:28,180
Once it starts chasing him on land and
these guys like get the fuck out of the

1156
01:05:28,181 --> 01:05:31,840
way, you know? Oh my God. 2000
pound gang big. But it's big.

1157
01:05:33,390 --> 01:05:38,140
It's a lot of church shoes. It's so big.
So a lot of church shoes, these things,

1158
01:05:38,141 --> 01:05:43,141
they live amongst us and they eat dogs
and they year and everything else.

1159
01:05:43,871 --> 01:05:44,471
They can get their hands.

1160
01:05:44,471 --> 01:05:48,670
They have to eat a lot of food to
maintain that fucking mass. Is this it?

1161
01:05:49,570 --> 01:05:51,270
So the guy, oh my God, he's got some what?

1162
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:55,150
Somebody's always got closed in
the gators chasing him. Holy Shit.

1163
01:05:56,080 --> 01:05:58,180
Oh fuck man. Whoa.

1164
01:05:58,570 --> 01:06:03,220
How Agile is for 80 do they move
quick? They move quick. I don't know.

1165
01:06:03,221 --> 01:06:05,800
Who knows how old that one is?
That could be a younger one. Oh,

1166
01:06:05,801 --> 01:06:08,950
he's stealing this dude's
fish and keep the fish. Wow.

1167
01:06:10,650 --> 01:06:15,340
He just got jack. That does not
look good. Rocket dial. Yeah,

1168
01:06:15,341 --> 01:06:17,800
I was going to say that. It doesn't look
like an alligator. That's a crocodile.

1169
01:06:17,890 --> 01:06:18,610
What's the difference?

1170
01:06:18,610 --> 01:06:21,760
Crocodiles have like a pointing or
snout and they're way more aggressive.

1171
01:06:22,510 --> 01:06:25,840
Don't fuck with a cruck. Alligators are
better. Yeah. Oh my God, they're better.

1172
01:06:25,900 --> 01:06:28,690
If it was as many crocodiles as
there are alligators in Florida,

1173
01:06:28,691 --> 01:06:32,500
way more people would be getting
jacked. Oh, so crock is Olo crock.

1174
01:06:32,501 --> 01:06:35,290
So fuck everybody up.
Cross do not discriminate.

1175
01:06:35,500 --> 01:06:39,460
They get water buffaloes,
people, they don't give a fuck.

1176
01:06:39,610 --> 01:06:42,190
They're real aggressive too.
There was this one video of 'em.

1177
01:06:42,550 --> 01:06:46,150
They had like an alligator farm and they
were raising alligators and then they

1178
01:06:46,151 --> 01:06:49,440
had one crocodile and so when it came
time to feeding the one Crockett,

1179
01:06:49,450 --> 01:06:51,310
I was like, bitch down. Sit the fuck down.

1180
01:06:51,430 --> 01:06:54,070
Climbing on top of these egg
roosters and hens like, yeah,

1181
01:06:54,071 --> 01:06:57,640
but she was on the top of all the
alligators. Fuck the fuck off of here.

1182
01:06:57,641 --> 01:07:00,290
And just took control and it was
getting the food. Now we'll crop.

1183
01:07:00,680 --> 01:07:04,120
Will a crocodile eat to an
alligator? That's a good question.

1184
01:07:04,630 --> 01:07:07,930
They hate each other. Do they really
turn to Cayman? Where's the Cayman Fall?

1185
01:07:08,080 --> 01:07:11,470
It's a crocodile, but it's a very
small crocodile. Cayman's are small.

1186
01:07:11,530 --> 01:07:15,190
They live in the Amazon. Have you
eaten crocodile? No. Or gator? Yeah,

1187
01:07:15,700 --> 01:07:18,040
I'll get her. I was like,
how do I want a place?

1188
01:07:18,041 --> 01:07:21,430
It was like a fucking TGI Friday's
type joint and it wasn't the best,

1189
01:07:22,570 --> 01:07:26,030
wasn't TGI Fridays, but you know, it was
like one Applebee's type place. Right.

1190
01:07:26,070 --> 01:07:29,860
Like a chain. And it wasn't like fresh.

1191
01:07:29,861 --> 01:07:32,720
But apparently when you get it
fresh like right off the gator,

1192
01:07:32,740 --> 01:07:35,650
it's supposed to be really good.
Just like any meat can be like the,

1193
01:07:35,660 --> 01:07:39,850
you know what I mean? Even rat. Yeah.
But the alligator thing is like, oh,

1194
01:07:39,880 --> 01:07:43,570
did you eat the gator dude?
We went crazy. What a weekend.

1195
01:07:45,260 --> 01:07:47,610
No am I a, my brother and
sister lived down there and uh,

1196
01:07:47,830 --> 01:07:52,000
my brother got a gun pulled on him.
Whoa. But like a delivery driver. Whoo.

1197
01:07:52,030 --> 01:07:55,780
So there, so my brother,
they a little baby,

1198
01:07:55,781 --> 01:08:00,310
my little niece and a there with her is
my brother and her in the back and then

1199
01:08:01,060 --> 01:08:03,700
he's driving us in the neighborhood.
He's going the speed limit, right?

1200
01:08:03,701 --> 01:08:06,250
Like maybe like five to 10 miles
an hour, maybe a little slower.

1201
01:08:06,760 --> 01:08:09,400
And there's a delivery driver
behind him. Deliver driver gets mad,

1202
01:08:09,560 --> 01:08:12,060
starts honking at him,
is behind him. Right. Uh,

1203
01:08:12,250 --> 01:08:14,680
my brother in law pulls into
the driveway delivery driver,

1204
01:08:14,681 --> 01:08:17,660
pulls him behind him and is
like, what do you want to do man?

1205
01:08:18,110 --> 01:08:20,810
And flashes a gun on him. And my brother
brother's like, he's as big as you,

1206
01:08:20,811 --> 01:08:23,360
he's like a bodybuilder
and he's a, he was like,

1207
01:08:23,720 --> 01:08:25,690
I don't want to do anything man. He's, I
just wonder why you're honking. I mean,

1208
01:08:25,780 --> 01:08:27,140
like, I'm, I got my daughter
in the back, you know,

1209
01:08:27,141 --> 01:08:30,320
she's like less than a year
old. And the guy's just like,

1210
01:08:30,321 --> 01:08:31,940
I'm not making this a
race thing. And he's like,

1211
01:08:31,941 --> 01:08:36,470
I'm not saying this is a race thing and
[inaudible] yeah. So he's just like,

1212
01:08:36,471 --> 01:08:38,300
well, and it might, you
know, might cause my, uh,

1213
01:08:38,330 --> 01:08:40,610
my brother was in the military and
he could come calling the guy, sir.

1214
01:08:41,090 --> 01:08:44,120
And the guy's like, you call me sir,
get in the military. And he's just like,

1215
01:08:44,121 --> 01:08:45,590
I am sorry, I am in the
military. And he just like,

1216
01:08:45,591 --> 01:08:47,870
we get a disgrace to the
military and he's just like,

1217
01:08:48,260 --> 01:08:51,260
I just went slow enough
because my daughter's in the
back and you're behind me.

1218
01:08:51,260 --> 01:08:53,900
So he's like, I don't understand
what the deal is here.

1219
01:08:53,901 --> 01:08:57,110
And the guys was just kept just trying
to egg them on to try to like provoke a

1220
01:08:57,111 --> 01:09:01,310
fight because of stand your ground. Oh
yeah, I made, it was when I heard about,

1221
01:09:01,311 --> 01:09:03,320
I was terrified. My, my,
my sister was shocked.

1222
01:09:03,321 --> 01:09:04,670
She had to come home from
work because was like,

1223
01:09:05,090 --> 01:09:07,220
you know the baby's in the back and
this guy just like pulled up into your

1224
01:09:07,221 --> 01:09:08,330
driveway and he's just like,

1225
01:09:08,480 --> 01:09:10,700
if Quincy would've made a
move and that guy shot him,

1226
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:11,870
that guy had been in the right.

1227
01:09:14,260 --> 01:09:16,810
How much of that's going on? That's
probably happening all the time.

1228
01:09:16,811 --> 01:09:17,710
Look web in the Trayvon,

1229
01:09:18,820 --> 01:09:22,990
that's a uniquely incompetent
security guard too though. I mean,

1230
01:09:22,991 --> 01:09:24,160
he was getting smashed.

1231
01:09:24,161 --> 01:09:27,190
He's getting his head bounced
off by 15 year old right now.

1232
01:09:27,220 --> 01:09:29,830
The kid was fucking him up when
he pulled that gun out. I mean

1233
01:09:30,250 --> 01:09:32,830
that happened to Florida too.
Wasn't that a a parking lot, right?

1234
01:09:33,130 --> 01:09:35,440
We're where a guy like thought he was
being threatened by a dude with his kids

1235
01:09:35,441 --> 01:09:39,190
in the car and then he shot the guy.
There's a parking lot in uh, in Florida.

1236
01:09:39,220 --> 01:09:41,200
I don't know that one. Well
that's where that, that I,

1237
01:09:41,280 --> 01:09:42,700
they haven't either last
year or something, but that,

1238
01:09:42,701 --> 01:09:43,660
that's definitely a recent one.

1239
01:09:43,840 --> 01:09:47,200
People just haven't guns all the
time. Seems like a great idea.

1240
01:09:47,230 --> 01:09:51,430
But the people like that having
guns. Yeah, it becomes a problem.

1241
01:09:51,431 --> 01:09:54,700
And somebody that somebody knows that you
don't have a gun and they're trying to

1242
01:09:54,701 --> 01:09:58,210
go do you into something so they could
shoot you like a fucking outlaw Josie

1243
01:09:58,210 --> 01:10:00,940
Wales movie. Like that's not
someone defending themselves.
So that's the weapon.

1244
01:10:01,200 --> 01:10:04,950
That's why guns are creepy. It's not
creepy because a guy like you has a gun,

1245
01:10:05,110 --> 01:10:07,400
which I'm, you're a great guy.
You're not gonna rob anybody. No,

1246
01:10:07,420 --> 01:10:09,450
I don't need a gun. You
wouldn't have a gun. Right.

1247
01:10:09,460 --> 01:10:12,100
But if you hit did have a gun, I
wouldn't be nervous. I'd been like, well,

1248
01:10:12,101 --> 01:10:13,630
Moses has a gun. He can handle it.

1249
01:10:14,250 --> 01:10:17,500
And I'm not looking at people
that aren't good guys. Right.

1250
01:10:17,580 --> 01:10:19,750
And if those good not good guys get a gun.

1251
01:10:20,710 --> 01:10:23,610
This is the one who's talking about
where the guys said big standard group in

1252
01:10:23,611 --> 01:10:26,790
case we just like on the ground with
his hands up and he's got shots still

1253
01:10:27,280 --> 01:10:30,180
really, like I said, he was felt
threatened or something. I believe

1254
01:10:30,360 --> 01:10:33,270
that's all they need is a reason to.
That's all they need is a reason.

1255
01:10:33,271 --> 01:10:36,480
The Florida, he's on the ground
on his knees and the guy shot him.

1256
01:10:37,470 --> 01:10:38,303
Oh my God.

1257
01:10:41,280 --> 01:10:43,020
Jesus Christ. I mean,

1258
01:10:43,680 --> 01:10:48,000
when do you not shoot someone if there
are, if, if you're sh you're willing,

1259
01:10:48,060 --> 01:10:49,980
are you willing to shoot
at me? They flattened out.

1260
01:10:50,260 --> 01:10:53,190
Like did he have to fuck that? It was
always like, if somebody is attacking you,

1261
01:10:53,191 --> 01:10:57,100
I thought, I mean that's your, that's
your on the offense flat now. Like,

1262
01:10:58,440 --> 01:11:01,510
no, you have to offer them
money. Please don't here.

1263
01:11:01,950 --> 01:11:04,080
Here's how much I think my
life. Would you accuse him?

1264
01:11:04,140 --> 01:11:06,420
I mean if he shot the guy while
was the guy was flattened out.

1265
01:11:07,080 --> 01:11:10,140
What about that do you think the same.
The beam, you know what I'm saying?

1266
01:11:10,141 --> 01:11:14,250
Like do you think like they'd have the
same reaction cause the reaction they had

1267
01:11:14,251 --> 01:11:17,600
when they saw him with his hands
up on his [inaudible] be mad. Yeah.

1268
01:11:17,640 --> 01:11:20,010
I don't know how mad you get. Oh, I
don't know how mad you are with a gun.

1269
01:11:20,130 --> 01:11:21,930
You're hit with a weapon in
your hand to be like, I can,

1270
01:11:22,080 --> 01:11:23,820
I'm playing God run out of this guy.

1271
01:11:23,821 --> 01:11:26,550
I can kill this man right now with
this person right here. Right. So yeah,

1272
01:11:26,551 --> 01:11:28,680
it wouldn't matter what they accuse him.

1273
01:11:28,710 --> 01:11:31,110
What I'm saying is what they accused
him because they didn't, he got away.

1274
01:11:31,350 --> 01:11:33,180
He got away with it. Right.
He was accused of it. Right.

1275
01:11:33,980 --> 01:11:37,020
It wasn't charged for this. They didn't
charge him. That's what I'm saying.

1276
01:11:37,021 --> 01:11:39,030
That's what I'm saying.
What? That's what I'm saying.

1277
01:11:39,390 --> 01:11:43,200
The guy that shot it wasn't arrested
yet. He's deciding stand your ground law.

1278
01:11:43,201 --> 01:11:46,530
I'm reading right here from the AP
Sheriff won't arrest parking lot shooter.

1279
01:11:46,590 --> 01:11:49,590
That's all. So they can't even charge
him. No, that's what I'm saying.

1280
01:11:49,620 --> 01:11:52,410
That's a charge like a, that's
like you can't challenge that rule.

1281
01:11:52,440 --> 01:11:55,460
Like in football, you can't,
that's not he a red flag.

1282
01:11:55,650 --> 01:11:58,560
He said he felt threatened in
the black. I was just like, dude,

1283
01:11:58,561 --> 01:12:02,070
I was on the ground and there's, there's,
there's closed circuit footage of it.

1284
01:12:02,860 --> 01:12:06,720
Yep. My question was what if
he had lied down, lie down,

1285
01:12:06,721 --> 01:12:10,470
flat on the ground with then he
be, I mean, when would they, what?

1286
01:12:10,650 --> 01:12:13,680
What would the line be where
they decide to charge him?

1287
01:12:14,070 --> 01:12:16,890
You know what I'm saying?
When he's on his knees. Okay.

1288
01:12:17,010 --> 01:12:19,150
Will you charge him with his lying
down? Like the guy's lying down.

1289
01:12:19,180 --> 01:12:22,460
Just execute him. Is that
still stand your ground there?

1290
01:12:23,400 --> 01:12:28,230
There is a manslaughter trial apparently
now updated 18 manslaughter. Oh,

1291
01:12:28,231 --> 01:12:32,010
he killed that guy. Try to
call the sheriff as a defense
witness. That's insane.

1292
01:12:32,570 --> 01:12:35,940
Insane. There's certain people
that should never gun right now.

1293
01:12:35,941 --> 01:12:37,670
There's certain people, a lot of you know,

1294
01:12:37,680 --> 01:12:40,980
seasoned law enforcement people and
people with good dispositions that would

1295
01:12:40,981 --> 01:12:45,000
never in their fucking wildest dreams
shoot someone who was on their knees would

1296
01:12:45,001 --> 01:12:49,080
never threaten anybody with a gun and
they have a gun purely for sense for

1297
01:12:49,081 --> 01:12:52,380
self-defense. That's a
different thing. You know,

1298
01:12:52,381 --> 01:12:54,870
but when you have everybody
can have a gun that's,

1299
01:12:55,010 --> 01:12:58,980
you're going to get a certain number
of those fucking guys and they think,

1300
01:12:58,981 --> 01:13:02,670
wait a minute, they think
they're in the right eye. Yeah.

1301
01:13:02,700 --> 01:13:05,830
I think we all got to get guns.
I mean like, is that not the,

1302
01:13:05,910 --> 01:13:09,510
it's not that the move. We know
we'll get guns. This is America.

1303
01:13:09,511 --> 01:13:11,520
We can be racist and have
guns and be on drugs.

1304
01:13:12,180 --> 01:13:14,310
Well you have to be on
drugs now. It's new.

1305
01:13:15,690 --> 01:13:18,210
There's gonna it's gonna come to
a point like, could you imagine?

1306
01:13:18,420 --> 01:13:21,680
How scared are you of your kids to go
to school now? That's scary. Scared.

1307
01:13:21,690 --> 01:13:25,110
When you have children, you're very
vulnerable. You know, you feel, um,

1308
01:13:25,710 --> 01:13:27,810
you feel more filled with
love than ever before,

1309
01:13:27,811 --> 01:13:31,230
but you also feel more feel with fear
cause you're, you're worried. I mean,

1310
01:13:31,231 --> 01:13:33,180
that's one of the things
that the Romans always knew.

1311
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:36,570
So make people have families. You can
control them if they have families.

1312
01:13:36,750 --> 01:13:40,120
Oh that's fucking powerful.
Yeah, you can control,

1313
01:13:40,910 --> 01:13:45,910
you can't control young dudes who were
saying those with swords or single.

1314
01:13:47,490 --> 01:13:51,930
You want them to get shacked up and have
kids when they stopped that way. Yeah.

1315
01:13:51,931 --> 01:13:55,020
And then you gotta kill somebody kids
every now and then keep them in line.

1316
01:13:55,760 --> 01:13:58,590
Jesus, Joe did Brown. I
mean that's what they did.

1317
01:13:58,650 --> 01:14:03,120
They did that from time honored
tradition. You killed somebody,

1318
01:14:03,130 --> 01:14:06,480
a kid to keep them in line for, they did
it with, they've done it in the Mafia.

1319
01:14:06,481 --> 01:14:08,150
They've done it with a lot
of people. I mean it's,

1320
01:14:08,520 --> 01:14:10,830
it's always been something that
people do to put fear in people.

1321
01:14:11,110 --> 01:14:14,470
You get people to when you have a lot
more to lose when you have a family,

1322
01:14:14,630 --> 01:14:17,200
they look at it that way. There's
certain people that, I mean,

1323
01:14:17,980 --> 01:14:22,030
when you study how to get people to
listen to you and to behave and how to

1324
01:14:22,031 --> 01:14:24,280
strike fear in the populace, that's why,

1325
01:14:24,281 --> 01:14:25,960
that's why they don't want abortion laws.

1326
01:14:27,480 --> 01:14:28,313
[inaudible]

1327
01:14:29,620 --> 01:14:32,830
wow. That's deep right dish. If,

1328
01:14:32,950 --> 01:14:37,950
if there is someone that
is really thinking we need,

1329
01:14:40,640 --> 01:14:43,640
we need to make sure that people
have families so that they'll be more

1330
01:14:43,641 --> 01:14:47,060
vulnerable. Yeah. If there is someone
that is following that philosophy,

1331
01:14:47,061 --> 01:14:50,210
which is not my thought. Yeah, exactly.
You said the Romans said that, but it's,

1332
01:14:50,240 --> 01:14:51,260
it's been around forever.

1333
01:14:51,540 --> 01:14:55,710
This is like a commonly like a human
human humans born. They think that like,

1334
01:14:55,880 --> 01:14:57,290
oh we have to keep
families, get them in line.

1335
01:14:57,350 --> 01:15:01,520
Well it's when you talk about the
authoritarian authoritarian figures,

1336
01:15:01,521 --> 01:15:05,420
like people that want to have an
iron fist control the population.

1337
01:15:05,750 --> 01:15:09,680
The last thing you want is a bunch of
young single guys running around with no

1338
01:15:09,681 --> 01:15:12,930
attachments because that's how coups
get successfully completed. Yeah.

1339
01:15:13,950 --> 01:15:17,040
He's young mercenaries just decided to
take over your fucking building like

1340
01:15:17,750 --> 01:15:19,370
spendable style and shoot everybody.

1341
01:15:19,371 --> 01:15:21,560
You don't want that because they
have nothing to lose. Right.

1342
01:15:21,800 --> 01:15:25,460
He wanted a guy who loves his
wife and he's got his kids and he,

1343
01:15:25,461 --> 01:15:29,030
you know he's got, yeah, he's
got something to lose and that's,

1344
01:15:29,360 --> 01:15:32,480
that's how you keep a society in order
and that's why you shouldn't be getting

1345
01:15:32,481 --> 01:15:35,570
rid of babies. No condoms, no
babies, no birth control, no babies.

1346
01:15:35,600 --> 01:15:40,010
If someone really was plotting
out a culture that way,

1347
01:15:40,011 --> 01:15:42,440
like really masterminding
it and really saying that,

1348
01:15:42,470 --> 01:15:46,130
not just knowing that if that is the
case that people do change when they have

1349
01:15:46,131 --> 01:15:46,640
children,

1350
01:15:46,640 --> 01:15:50,000
but then doing this and promoting this
on purpose specifically to control

1351
01:15:50,001 --> 01:15:54,680
people. If that was the case, yeah, they
would do that. They would do that too.

1352
01:15:54,710 --> 01:15:55,430
They would, they would,

1353
01:15:55,430 --> 01:15:58,460
they would work against abortion because
they would want more people to have

1354
01:15:58,461 --> 01:16:02,060
more kids so that they can control
them. That makes sense. Well good.

1355
01:16:02,210 --> 01:16:06,770
It's crazy. So crazy to think that way.
But it would only be like one factor.

1356
01:16:06,980 --> 01:16:11,480
I think the major factor is
religion because if you are, um,

1357
01:16:11,660 --> 01:16:16,660
if you are pro-life and a candidate
is a pro choice in your mind,

1358
01:16:19,520 --> 01:16:21,460
a lot of times people decide that,

1359
01:16:21,461 --> 01:16:24,770
that that person is
against like God's law.

1360
01:16:24,980 --> 01:16:27,410
That person wants to kill children, right.

1361
01:16:28,160 --> 01:16:30,860
So they almost feel like compelled devote,

1362
01:16:31,890 --> 01:16:32,030
yeah.

1363
01:16:32,030 --> 01:16:34,850
You know, to, to vote against
you if you're pro choice.

1364
01:16:35,220 --> 01:16:37,900
But like are they thinking
about, well, you know,

1365
01:16:37,910 --> 01:16:40,340
what did this mother doesn't raise this
child? Now you have this, you know,

1366
01:16:40,341 --> 01:16:42,200
this mother who's resentful
of this child that she had,

1367
01:16:42,201 --> 01:16:45,400
that you guys made her have [inaudible]
and this child who's, you know,

1368
01:16:45,650 --> 01:16:48,950
this loveless child now and they both,
you know, she's got mental illness,

1369
01:16:48,980 --> 01:16:51,350
he's got mental illness because you
know, he's looking for his mother's love.

1370
01:16:51,351 --> 01:16:55,130
She's like, this kid wrote my dreams,
you know, this husband didn't stay,

1371
01:16:55,131 --> 01:16:57,770
that kind of thing. And you're just,
you're, you're making these communities,

1372
01:16:57,771 --> 01:17:01,010
you know, depressed and sad, you
know, and then you guys, you said, no,

1373
01:17:01,011 --> 01:17:03,410
you have to have that. You're
not raising this kid. You know,

1374
01:17:03,550 --> 01:17:06,230
you don't put money in that, you
know, and this, this family's pocket.

1375
01:17:06,560 --> 01:17:08,210
All these things you're
saying are true. Yeah.

1376
01:17:08,450 --> 01:17:13,450
It's one of those things where you
could see two to like distinct patterns,

1377
01:17:14,301 --> 01:17:18,770
but infinite different
varieties of completely the
world sucks because the baby

1378
01:17:18,771 --> 01:17:22,660
was born or the world is amazing. Right?
The baby's born. Tim Tebow says that,

1379
01:17:22,661 --> 01:17:25,970
you know, he's, that's the thing, man.
It's true. Tim. He goes, awesome. True.

1380
01:17:27,280 --> 01:17:29,570
I mean it's, you never
know. You never know.

1381
01:17:29,571 --> 01:17:33,380
But it's whose decision should it be?
And what is it? That's the real question.

1382
01:17:33,740 --> 01:17:36,260
Like what is abortion,
right? Like what is it?

1383
01:17:36,261 --> 01:17:41,050
Is it killing a baby or is it a medical
procedure? Like which one is it? Oof.

1384
01:17:41,300 --> 01:17:42,200
And as a slippery slope,

1385
01:17:42,230 --> 01:17:47,000
that's where the debate falls in pro
choice or pro choice or pro life.

1386
01:17:47,630 --> 01:17:52,130
It's not that these pro choice
people are evil people. No,

1387
01:17:52,190 --> 01:17:54,530
they just don't want anybody dictating.

1388
01:17:54,830 --> 01:17:58,280
I mean signed like an evil organization
that's created by Satan. It's not,

1389
01:17:58,400 --> 01:17:58,850
it's not.

1390
01:17:58,850 --> 01:18:02,180
It's women that don't want you to tell
them what to do with their reproductive

1391
01:18:02,210 --> 01:18:05,690
system. That's what it is. They want to
be able to make the choice themselves.

1392
01:18:06,140 --> 01:18:11,140
But then there's other people that
are pro life and specifically the more

1393
01:18:11,271 --> 01:18:14,960
militant ones, which you know, have
a assassinated abortion doctors.

1394
01:18:14,961 --> 01:18:15,351
I mean there are,

1395
01:18:15,351 --> 01:18:19,280
there are people that firmly believed
that even if it's just a couple of days

1396
01:18:19,280 --> 01:18:21,180
old, right, it's a baby. Right.

1397
01:18:21,320 --> 01:18:25,130
And that any sort of procedure to
stop that in its place is murder.

1398
01:18:25,160 --> 01:18:28,400
You're murdering a baby and there's
no if, ands, or buts about it.

1399
01:18:28,401 --> 01:18:32,000
And it's like the way they look at
the loony laughed and that they,

1400
01:18:32,150 --> 01:18:34,730
they buy into this
bullshit and you know that,

1401
01:18:34,731 --> 01:18:38,510
that that's a narrative that, you know,

1402
01:18:39,320 --> 01:18:41,450
that's how they, that's
how they really believe.

1403
01:18:41,510 --> 01:18:45,860
And people demonize people on both sides
of it as if they're so different and

1404
01:18:45,861 --> 01:18:48,680
there's no way you could ever think any
differently the way than the way you're

1405
01:18:48,681 --> 01:18:50,390
thinking it right now. No, I think you,

1406
01:18:50,391 --> 01:18:53,630
you broke it down just like is that a
medical procedure or is it the other way?

1407
01:18:53,631 --> 01:18:57,860
And I think that's a, that's that's
hard to get into that you can't,

1408
01:18:58,670 --> 01:19:00,650
I mean that's, that will be
debating that til the end of time.

1409
01:19:00,890 --> 01:19:05,890
Well it's one of the most human subjects
because it shows how complicated shit

1410
01:19:06,591 --> 01:19:09,020
really is. And if you
try to pretend it's not,

1411
01:19:09,560 --> 01:19:13,250
then you get into late term abortions.
And I'm like, well, what's up there?

1412
01:19:14,470 --> 01:19:17,990
When, when does it get weird
for you? When is six months?

1413
01:19:17,991 --> 01:19:21,440
Does it get weird then? Look, it's weird.
Like, I'm not saying you should be,

1414
01:19:21,441 --> 01:19:23,630
it shouldn't be able to have
an abortion or should be,

1415
01:19:23,660 --> 01:19:25,250
I'm not saying either of those things.

1416
01:19:25,550 --> 01:19:28,880
I'm just saying to deny
the weirdness at the very,

1417
01:19:28,910 --> 01:19:32,810
the nicest term that I could come up
with weirdness. Right. It is weird.

1418
01:19:33,410 --> 01:19:38,300
I had a, I got a girl pregnant, I was a
teenager and, uh, she had an abortion,

1419
01:19:38,570 --> 01:19:43,490
I'm sorry. She had a miscarriage,
nature's abortion. And then, uh, she, uh,

1420
01:19:43,550 --> 01:19:44,061
she would,

1421
01:19:44,061 --> 01:19:48,890
I was eight weeks or nine weeks and she
was flushing out chunks of who she was

1422
01:19:48,891 --> 01:19:51,650
calling the baby. So I mean, that's at
like eight to nine weeks. Everybody.

1423
01:19:52,190 --> 01:19:55,970
Jesus. Crazy. So wow. And she
shouldn't have had a baby.

1424
01:19:55,971 --> 01:19:58,040
She was on crystal meth. I mean,
that, that shouldn't have happened.

1425
01:19:58,041 --> 01:20:02,330
So thank whatever. Higher power
did that for us. But um, yeah,

1426
01:20:02,331 --> 01:20:04,850
that's what I'm saying. Like that.
I mean, that's what you're saying.

1427
01:20:04,880 --> 01:20:08,520
That's why it's so messy and it really
is messy because you don't know what is

1428
01:20:08,521 --> 01:20:12,480
what. Right. You know, she's like,
it traumatized her. Yeah. You know,

1429
01:20:12,540 --> 01:20:13,373
makes sense.

1430
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:19,000
I mean a crazy process that the human
body goes through that men will never

1431
01:20:20,310 --> 01:20:24,480
really understand because there's never
going to been going to be an opportunity

1432
01:20:24,481 --> 01:20:28,230
where a body grows inside your body
and then comes out of your body,

1433
01:20:28,680 --> 01:20:31,440
the way a woman experiences.
And that's mainly it. Shit Dude.

1434
01:20:31,441 --> 01:20:35,970
Women experience something that
is so alien to anything that the,

1435
01:20:36,190 --> 01:20:40,620
that males experience that grow a
body inside of them. Yeah, it's very,

1436
01:20:40,621 --> 01:20:44,100
it's so different. We're
so deep. It's so different.

1437
01:20:44,101 --> 01:20:47,610
Like in terms of how they interface
with the world. They have to nurturing.

1438
01:20:47,820 --> 01:20:50,370
They want to protect the Nast and keep
everybody safe and they're going to have

1439
01:20:50,371 --> 01:20:52,410
a baby inside boom.

1440
01:20:52,600 --> 01:20:55,260
And now they have to take care of this
baby and care for and then the baby will

1441
01:20:55,261 --> 01:20:59,710
become more people and they'll start
mating and they get become adults and they

1442
01:21:01,610 --> 01:21:06,480
[inaudible] earthlings. Y comes
out of their body. And for us, man,

1443
01:21:06,481 --> 01:21:10,930
we just, we just shoot loads. So
easy. This is like what the art,

1444
01:21:11,100 --> 01:21:15,090
what we do when we don't have a baby and
what we do when we have a baby is the

1445
01:21:15,091 --> 01:21:20,091
exact same thing like you to when you
have sex with a woman and she gets

1446
01:21:21,811 --> 01:21:22,920
impregnated, it's,

1447
01:21:22,970 --> 01:21:27,090
it feels like regular sex to us and we
have sex all the time and you don't get

1448
01:21:27,091 --> 01:21:29,640
pregnant and then all of a sudden
you are. So it's like weird.

1449
01:21:29,910 --> 01:21:33,330
Like we didn't even do anything. We
just had sex. Like we normally have sex,

1450
01:21:33,870 --> 01:21:37,650
we had sex, and now there's an ex, an
extra person. Like Whoa, like why? It's,

1451
01:21:38,070 --> 01:21:40,800
but there's a lot of times because you
say you associate sex with pleasure,

1452
01:21:41,540 --> 01:21:46,320
like it is obviously, but when
you have a baby you're like, oh,

1453
01:21:46,321 --> 01:21:51,180
it does that. Does that. Yes, it
does. Yeah. Does that, so for a man,

1454
01:21:51,181 --> 01:21:55,890
there's no, there's no difference
in what happens to his body, right?

1455
01:21:55,891 --> 01:21:59,370
Like whether and when he's having sex
and a baby's conceived versus when he's

1456
01:21:59,371 --> 01:22:03,210
having sex and nothing, it's just
fun. There's no difference to him.

1457
01:22:03,211 --> 01:22:06,060
He doesn't feel a difference.
Whereas a woman, literally,

1458
01:22:06,061 --> 01:22:09,150
her body will fucking grow a person,

1459
01:22:09,260 --> 01:22:11,360
that person with a brain
that she's serious.

1460
01:22:11,550 --> 01:22:15,000
She's sharing things with this
things kicking inside of her.

1461
01:22:15,090 --> 01:22:19,950
Like that experience. It'll
fuck you up for a man. I mean,

1462
01:22:19,980 --> 01:22:24,750
I would like, I do not like if
there was an a way that you could,

1463
01:22:25,160 --> 01:22:25,260
uh,

1464
01:22:25,260 --> 01:22:28,740
record what it's like to be someone and
then they give you like a little chip

1465
01:22:28,741 --> 01:22:32,190
and you would slip it in there
and I could, I could see you like,

1466
01:22:32,370 --> 01:22:36,780
you would allow people, all of your
feelings, the way your skin feels,

1467
01:22:37,210 --> 01:22:39,780
the way your emotions are, the
way your psychology is set up.

1468
01:22:39,781 --> 01:22:44,781
You would allow all people to literally
be you for a couple of days and the chip

1469
01:22:44,821 --> 01:22:45,601
would do the, yeah.

1470
01:22:45,601 --> 01:22:48,930
This chip would just sit in your head
and you as food be that person. Yeah,

1471
01:22:49,560 --> 01:22:53,930
I would, I would like to feel what
it's like to be pregnant. Really? Yeah.

1472
01:22:54,390 --> 01:22:56,880
You want to feel that, that like,
that rip that pay or just like,

1473
01:22:56,881 --> 01:23:00,550
just not the birth partner. Fuck
that. And I don't want the debt.

1474
01:23:01,920 --> 01:23:04,260
Right. I don't want to get fucked
up. I don't want to get fucked.

1475
01:23:04,320 --> 01:23:07,490
I don't want to imagine if that was
the only way you could feel it. Right.

1476
01:23:07,510 --> 01:23:08,220
I would,

1477
01:23:08,220 --> 01:23:12,610
I would wonder what it would like
to first of all be a maternal woman.

1478
01:23:13,060 --> 01:23:16,750
I W I mean I'm really curious as to
what the, the hormones feel like,

1479
01:23:16,940 --> 01:23:19,990
what it must feel like. Cause
I don't think we, you know,

1480
01:23:19,991 --> 01:23:22,840
when you see a woman you try
to understand like what is,

1481
01:23:22,870 --> 01:23:25,590
what's the world through
her eyes, you know,

1482
01:23:25,630 --> 01:23:27,640
you're never going to
feel the way she feels.

1483
01:23:27,641 --> 01:23:29,860
I'm never gonna look at
somebody else and be like, oh,

1484
01:23:29,861 --> 01:23:32,170
they can kill me right now at the
time. You know what I mean too. Yeah.

1485
01:23:32,171 --> 01:23:33,520
That too. That's a huge part.

1486
01:23:33,790 --> 01:23:38,110
But I mean even just interfacing with
the world through a different type of

1487
01:23:38,111 --> 01:23:39,010
human body,

1488
01:23:39,250 --> 01:23:44,250
a female human body versus a male human
body in terms of like estrogen and the

1489
01:23:44,261 --> 01:23:48,520
testosterone ratio and how your maternal
instincts and oxytocin and all these

1490
01:23:48,521 --> 01:23:52,860
different videos, heightened
sensitivity, you know,

1491
01:23:52,900 --> 01:23:56,710
in certain situations they have like super
powers that actually describe it that

1492
01:23:56,711 --> 01:24:00,310
way. Making humans, humans and their body,

1493
01:24:00,311 --> 01:24:03,510
and they have to like make sure that
everyone's safe around them because, uh,

1494
01:24:03,550 --> 01:24:08,200
every now and then men will murder
them or yeah. Or rape. Exactly.

1495
01:24:08,560 --> 01:24:12,940
Jesus. Crazy. Sorry ladies. Sorry.
Yeah. When you really think about it,

1496
01:24:12,970 --> 01:24:17,830
it's like what am a mad
relationship? It's mad.

1497
01:24:18,070 --> 01:24:20,950
The relationship between males
and females. Yeah, it's mad.

1498
01:24:21,700 --> 01:24:24,390
That's why I always laugh
at dudes who get, you know,

1499
01:24:24,790 --> 01:24:28,950
when guys get jack for their divorce
money, I was like, ah, come on.

1500
01:24:28,960 --> 01:24:29,793
You're going to be all right.

1501
01:24:30,300 --> 01:24:33,130
You got to all the terrible things
that could go wrong. That's just,

1502
01:24:33,131 --> 01:24:35,980
you just get jacked for some money.
I liked that perspective actually.

1503
01:24:35,981 --> 01:24:37,990
I kind of puts it all in
perspective. You're just like, yeah,

1504
01:24:38,050 --> 01:24:42,550
that's how many raped and killed
you killed. He just, he got, look,

1505
01:24:42,580 --> 01:24:45,400
people get into bad relationships. I mean,

1506
01:24:45,401 --> 01:24:48,040
I'm not happy that someone ever
gets into a bad relationship,

1507
01:24:48,400 --> 01:24:49,930
but if you get an a bad
relationship and it's,

1508
01:24:49,931 --> 01:24:52,370
she's just a gold digger and
each one would go, oh God.

1509
01:24:52,680 --> 01:24:55,520
Like I've had so many friends that
have been like, ah, my fucking ex-wife.

1510
01:24:55,600 --> 01:24:58,420
She wants more money. You got to
go to court. I'm like, wow. Yeah,

1511
01:24:58,960 --> 01:25:02,230
but you can't get your murder
player. And it's like you fucked up.

1512
01:25:02,290 --> 01:25:04,790
You shouldn't have married her.
That's not me. She didn't know.

1513
01:25:05,150 --> 01:25:09,130
She didn't know when she was crazy.
Would you read the rape, the murder

1514
01:25:10,700 --> 01:25:14,440
preempt? Really? Yeah, for sure.
You sure don't want either one?

1515
01:25:14,500 --> 01:25:18,490
Obviously if a guy rapes me and I'm
still alive, then I get to murder him.

1516
01:25:18,880 --> 01:25:21,550
Oh Shit. You got to think about it
that way you can get the murder.

1517
01:25:22,940 --> 01:25:27,160
I'd rather gone. No, I don't get, I don't
get murdered. I just get raped. Okay.

1518
01:25:27,580 --> 01:25:30,160
I'll wait. But then it's like there's
the trauma with that though. You know,

1519
01:25:30,460 --> 01:25:33,700
there'll be trauma. You're not gonna
enjoy it. Yeah. It's going to be terrible.

1520
01:25:34,360 --> 01:25:38,500
Yeah. But um, it's better
than being dead. Okay.

1521
01:25:38,710 --> 01:25:43,570
I'm not saying it's good. No, but,
alright. But for me, he as a man,

1522
01:25:43,870 --> 01:25:48,760
as a human, I get raped then
murdered for sure. There you go.

1523
01:25:49,240 --> 01:25:52,180
Joe Wick. After that. 100% yeah.

1524
01:25:52,210 --> 01:25:56,650
Just so everybody fucking 100% fill
rate me or I'll murder you. Yeah,

1525
01:25:56,680 --> 01:25:58,750
I'll have a new goal in life.

1526
01:26:00,580 --> 01:26:02,590
But you gotta say goodbye to
everybody before you do it.

1527
01:26:04,130 --> 01:26:07,610
Cause you your doctor that you're going
to stay alive. Yeah. It's not John Wick.

1528
01:26:07,611 --> 01:26:11,970
John Wick just drives home. Yeah.
They arrest you for dude, fuck you.

1529
01:26:11,971 --> 01:26:15,140
And then you kill them and they
go to you immediately. I go, hey,

1530
01:26:15,200 --> 01:26:16,480
did you kill it? Like how the fuck do you

1531
01:26:21,540 --> 01:26:25,460
mean by the way? No. What happened?

1532
01:26:26,390 --> 01:26:28,740
I mean, what does the cop say? It's
just like, dude, he raped me though.

1533
01:26:28,990 --> 01:26:32,390
He's just like, ah, yeah, well the,
you can that there's law, you can't,

1534
01:26:32,570 --> 01:26:36,140
or a guy because he raped you. O J
says there are rules so you can't,

1535
01:26:36,500 --> 01:26:40,620
you can't be saying to the world, Hey,

1536
01:26:40,970 --> 01:26:45,800
if you can a shirt, hey Twitter shirts,

1537
01:26:46,130 --> 01:26:50,350
I wonder if like he would sue you. Right?
Because like there's people that um,

1538
01:26:50,360 --> 01:26:51,320
if you made a shirt,

1539
01:26:51,350 --> 01:26:54,410
like if you might say if you made
a Conor McGregor shirt and you, uh,

1540
01:26:54,411 --> 01:26:55,970
had some quotes on it,
you were selling it,

1541
01:26:56,180 --> 01:27:00,620
he could like maybe sue you if you keep
his face off or he come to your house

1542
01:27:00,621 --> 01:27:03,410
with like a bunch of dudes like
take all his stuff back yourself.

1543
01:27:03,410 --> 01:27:05,510
A picture of ojs face like leanings.

1544
01:27:05,540 --> 01:27:10,130
That selfie camera just says
hurry Twitter world. I mean,

1545
01:27:10,240 --> 01:27:14,890
come on Twitter verse by the
way, cause I know it's, oh,

1546
01:27:15,140 --> 01:27:18,700
Jay's world. Hey Twitter world. He
can do whatever the fuck you want.

1547
01:27:18,780 --> 01:27:23,510
So he did that shirt would be giant.
It's probably being made right now.

1548
01:27:23,690 --> 01:27:28,220
There's nerds that are listening
to us right now that are gone.

1549
01:27:28,310 --> 01:27:32,000
They're just going to hit pause
right now and make Twitter. Yeah,

1550
01:27:32,001 --> 01:27:35,350
you just made a OJ submerge hate
Twitter world. I was just going to wait.

1551
01:27:35,510 --> 01:27:38,210
Not going to get that money. The money
I was going to go to the abused women,

1552
01:27:38,600 --> 01:27:40,040
good. And waiters,

1553
01:27:42,560 --> 01:27:44,390
waiters who've been
murdered by boyfriends.

1554
01:27:46,310 --> 01:27:51,170
God Damn little that knife to ugh
personal. And they never found that knife.

1555
01:27:51,171 --> 01:27:53,360
They never found that knife.
Yeah. Who had that knife?

1556
01:27:53,870 --> 01:27:58,450
I mean Damn OJ Damn Ojai he looked
for is like 17 like an ex-convict.

1557
01:27:58,460 --> 01:28:01,940
He looks good. Was playing golf all
day, was he? That's all he does.

1558
01:28:02,250 --> 01:28:05,150
Even like golf goes out and
plays golf. He looks great.

1559
01:28:06,020 --> 01:28:11,020
He seems to have at least a slight
struggle with communicating right and

1560
01:28:12,231 --> 01:28:16,760
walking. He seems like he's gotten
a little slowness towards voice.

1561
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:19,040
We're just fortunate.
You know what I mean?

1562
01:28:19,400 --> 01:28:23,780
Which is probably CTE. Oh, is that CT?

1563
01:28:24,380 --> 01:28:27,830
But he sounds pretty cool. Pretty
clear, pretty clear. There's a,

1564
01:28:27,831 --> 01:28:31,520
there's a hint, there's a
hitch, you know, you get it,

1565
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,070
you see it in fighters or um,

1566
01:28:34,610 --> 01:28:38,120
just there's a s you never know because
it might just be you're tired. Right.

1567
01:28:38,150 --> 01:28:39,440
I'm thinking he's, he's this,

1568
01:28:39,500 --> 01:28:42,410
but there's some days where I'm jet
lagged or tired. I'm just really stupid.

1569
01:28:42,890 --> 01:28:44,390
I don't talk that good.
He also like, you know,

1570
01:28:44,391 --> 01:28:46,770
he did beat two murder cases
that'll make you a little, you know,

1571
01:28:48,010 --> 01:28:51,000
he's in his seventies right, isn't
he? Yeah, he's in a seventies yet,

1572
01:28:51,200 --> 01:28:54,830
but still there's tourism
is a struggle. Crutch,

1573
01:28:54,890 --> 01:28:56,900
slight struggle to the way he's talking.

1574
01:28:57,230 --> 01:29:01,990
That makes me think he's dealing
with some sparks. OJ Simpson worried

1575
01:29:02,130 --> 01:29:06,300
he has CTE. I have days that
I can't find words. Yeah,

1576
01:29:06,390 --> 01:29:09,840
100% but CTE makes you murder people
write that shit. I mean, he could be,

1577
01:29:10,140 --> 01:29:12,510
I mean, is that, would that,
would you use that today? Oh, Jay,

1578
01:29:12,570 --> 01:29:14,580
that's what his lawyer said. Not really.

1579
01:29:14,581 --> 01:29:18,720
One of his lawyers had said that it
had OJ Simpson was a lawyer or was it a

1580
01:29:18,721 --> 01:29:20,860
medical advisor? May medical advise.

1581
01:29:20,870 --> 01:29:23,970
I said I would bet my medical
license that he had a CT. Yeah.

1582
01:29:23,971 --> 01:29:27,420
But he was also saying that it would
have been a part of the defense. Right.

1583
01:29:27,421 --> 01:29:30,620
It would have been a part of the,
the crime had happened today. I mean,

1584
01:29:30,810 --> 01:29:32,610
that's what I'm saying. Right.
That's why. But Aaron Hernandez,

1585
01:29:32,611 --> 01:29:35,930
they were saying [inaudible]
dude with all of them, NDP when,

1586
01:29:36,020 --> 01:29:38,940
and obviously you're in a
super violent sport too,

1587
01:29:39,250 --> 01:29:41,960
the most violent and
then two, you're gonna,

1588
01:29:42,200 --> 01:29:45,850
you're gonna have a high capacity
for violence, right? Yeah. You know,

1589
01:29:45,970 --> 01:29:49,250
I mean that does. And then on top of
that, if you're, you're fucking wirings

1590
01:29:51,040 --> 01:29:55,530
if you've been smashed so many times
and they do get smashed and their wiring

1591
01:29:55,531 --> 01:29:59,850
does go for some of them fighters
and yeah, they get a little haywire.

1592
01:30:00,300 --> 01:30:04,410
Chris, Ben Wa. Yeah, that
was terrible. That guy,

1593
01:30:04,590 --> 01:30:09,500
that kind of shit is so petrifying. I
could kill his family. I mean, and um,

1594
01:30:09,570 --> 01:30:14,570
many people that have experienced extreme
CTE have wound up when they committed

1595
01:30:14,761 --> 01:30:18,300
suicide, donating their brain,
like saying, um, you know,

1596
01:30:18,301 --> 01:30:21,840
like that one dot. Do Junior, junior sal,

1597
01:30:22,110 --> 01:30:24,810
he shot himself in the chest. Right.
So that they could look as brain.

1598
01:30:26,430 --> 01:30:28,530
That's hard, man. That's hard. I mean,

1599
01:30:28,531 --> 01:30:31,980
that's what fights have you been in
every, tells you you've been concussed?

1600
01:30:32,130 --> 01:30:35,580
I don't know. I don't know how
many times I've been concussed. Um,

1601
01:30:37,170 --> 01:30:41,160
I've never been knocked unconscious,
but I got TKO in a kickboxing match.

1602
01:30:41,490 --> 01:30:45,720
The last fight I ever had, I got
cracked a crack with a left hook.

1603
01:30:45,990 --> 01:30:49,140
It was like, it was one of the weirdest
times have ever been hit because um,

1604
01:30:49,640 --> 01:30:50,820
I had been a def,

1605
01:30:50,870 --> 01:30:54,810
been hit hard before but it never
been hit where my leg stopped working.

1606
01:30:55,060 --> 01:30:57,690
They just stopped. They just
stopped. Like he hit me,

1607
01:30:57,900 --> 01:31:01,950
he caught me like right at the tip of my
jaw with like a left hook that I didn't

1608
01:31:01,951 --> 01:31:06,460
see coming and my leg just went wait
seas, they just gave out. They gave out.

1609
01:31:06,461 --> 01:31:08,550
Like they shut off.
There's a nerve in here.

1610
01:31:08,551 --> 01:31:12,240
You're saying that's Kinda like you get
hit and your jaw goes sideways and your

1611
01:31:12,241 --> 01:31:17,241
head twists and your brain sloshes
around in there and it's like a bolt of

1612
01:31:17,341 --> 01:31:20,820
electricity. It's like, it's
like everything shuts off,

1613
01:31:21,500 --> 01:31:26,100
shuts off. Um, but I was still
conscious but I was like, oh shit,

1614
01:31:26,130 --> 01:31:29,130
what is going on here? Like this is
crazy. And I was like, all right,

1615
01:31:29,131 --> 01:31:30,960
get back up two feet. So
the referee was counting,

1616
01:31:30,990 --> 01:31:33,840
he got to eight or something
like that. I got up to my feet,

1617
01:31:34,380 --> 01:31:37,740
they dusted my gloves off and the kid
came at me again and hit me with an

1618
01:31:38,300 --> 01:31:40,590
uppercut, another punch, drop me
again. Then they stopped a fight.

1619
01:31:41,010 --> 01:31:42,720
So I was never unconscious,

1620
01:31:42,900 --> 01:31:46,380
but that was the worst I'd ever been
like beaten in a fight where it just

1621
01:31:46,770 --> 01:31:48,750
knuckle sandwiches at the sparks flying,

1622
01:31:49,970 --> 01:31:53,370
which that was what the
last time ever fought.

1623
01:31:53,940 --> 01:31:58,770
But other than that there was a lot of
like training sessions where you get

1624
01:31:58,771 --> 01:32:02,320
kicked in the face or punched
or there's a lot of those.

1625
01:32:02,850 --> 01:32:04,960
It's just just happens
and most of the time,

1626
01:32:06,400 --> 01:32:10,870
you know if you get hit full blast, it's
an accident. Can you get tested for CT?

1627
01:32:11,130 --> 01:32:15,910
Is that a thing? They test?
There's no test for CT.

1628
01:32:15,911 --> 01:32:18,220
They have tested a few
people while they're alive.

1629
01:32:18,221 --> 01:32:20,650
They have them look at the
brain to find the stuff.

1630
01:32:20,800 --> 01:32:24,980
So they have to drill a hole in your
brain yet to prove to like have on on

1631
01:32:25,600 --> 01:32:27,610
denials. You gotta die first. Yeah, the,

1632
01:32:27,611 --> 01:32:32,611
they like to do autopsies on people
with CTE and the crazy atrophied brains.

1633
01:32:34,960 --> 01:32:39,640
The brain of an 85 year old person
with, with Alzheimer's disease.

1634
01:32:40,150 --> 01:32:43,270
It's really nuts man. Like
their brains are fucked up.

1635
01:32:43,810 --> 01:32:47,410
There's all these weird proteins
get developed from the concussions

1636
01:32:49,290 --> 01:32:51,280
fuck. But like with like, like
calcifies the brain or something.

1637
01:32:51,420 --> 01:32:54,430
He does horrible things. He eats
way different parts of the brain.

1638
01:32:54,431 --> 01:32:56,730
There's like these little
dark spots and holes. Man.

1639
01:32:57,000 --> 01:33:00,220
I'm not exactly sure what the
mental processes but the uh,

1640
01:33:00,221 --> 01:33:03,490
the medical processes rather,
but they, it was like dead spots,

1641
01:33:03,491 --> 01:33:06,580
like your brains dead days when
they always disgrace. Okay.

1642
01:33:06,581 --> 01:33:10,810
Former NFL player confirmed his first
diagnose of CTE in living patient. Yeah.

1643
01:33:10,940 --> 01:33:15,870
We had talked about this before.
So they're able now to get, uh,

1644
01:33:15,910 --> 01:33:19,270
some sort of an accurate recording of
what your brain looks like and they can

1645
01:33:19,271 --> 01:33:21,730
see the CTE without having to open you up.

1646
01:33:21,731 --> 01:33:26,380
But I think most of the time it's when
a person's already dead. Maybe their,

1647
01:33:26,650 --> 01:33:30,790
their detection methods are
getting better. Listen, man,

1648
01:33:30,791 --> 01:33:32,320
if you look at that brain,
go back to that reel,

1649
01:33:32,350 --> 01:33:35,470
that image when the guy's
a punk poking at the brain.

1650
01:33:35,830 --> 01:33:40,120
Then he's looking at the
x-rays or the, the MRIs.

1651
01:33:41,110 --> 01:33:44,440
Look at, look at this, look at
that. Just look at that thing.

1652
01:33:45,760 --> 01:33:50,760
That which is protected by a thin layer
of bone is where all of your fucking

1653
01:33:53,111 --> 01:33:55,150
thinking takes place. All of it.

1654
01:33:55,390 --> 01:34:00,390
It's an Oregon and you
get punched in the face.

1655
01:34:01,270 --> 01:34:05,470
All of that is just bro, like
detaching from the walls,

1656
01:34:05,800 --> 01:34:09,080
all the connective tissue.
What is that stuff called that?

1657
01:34:09,490 --> 01:34:14,490
That real weird stuff that sits between
what kind of connective tissues that

1658
01:34:14,741 --> 01:34:19,660
described as between the brain and the
skull. It's like a specific name for it.

1659
01:34:20,200 --> 01:34:24,270
Oh, like that? Uh, that, that then
later, yeah, and that stuff gets ripped.

1660
01:34:25,030 --> 01:34:28,750
It's tears free and you're, you're,
you're fucked when you get hit,

1661
01:34:28,751 --> 01:34:33,160
you're saying. Yeah. Sometimes people
develop internal bleeding after fights.

1662
01:34:33,161 --> 01:34:37,530
Like shades is the, yeah, combat sports.
Crazy. I mean it's your, it's your,

1663
01:34:37,660 --> 01:34:39,620
oh wait, wait. Another guy just
died, right? Another boxer,

1664
01:34:39,630 --> 01:34:44,470
another box or two boxers died in
a very short period of time. Yeah.

1665
01:34:44,620 --> 01:34:47,590
Some people think that they should
shorten fights now [inaudible] that they

1666
01:34:47,591 --> 01:34:48,910
should make them like eight rounds,

1667
01:34:49,200 --> 01:34:50,710
but cause guys are just bigger
and faster and stronger.

1668
01:34:51,310 --> 01:34:55,790
I mean the just people just
want to mitigate the, the
thing, the damage, right,

1669
01:34:55,860 --> 01:34:56,860
mitigate the damage. But

1670
01:34:58,410 --> 01:35:01,040
if you did that in the
high land level fights,

1671
01:35:01,041 --> 01:35:04,790
you'd miss amazing fights like
Deontay wilder and Tyson fury.

1672
01:35:04,791 --> 01:35:09,680
If that wasn't 12 rounds when when wilder
knocked him down the 12th round and

1673
01:35:09,800 --> 01:35:11,240
fewer he rose from the dead,

1674
01:35:11,600 --> 01:35:14,690
we would have missed one of the greatest
moments in the history of the sport.

1675
01:35:15,290 --> 01:35:18,740
I mean that was an amazing
moment, man. For two reasons. One,

1676
01:35:18,860 --> 01:35:21,590
can you see how fucking hard
Deontay punches and two,

1677
01:35:21,591 --> 01:35:26,540
that wilder who looked like he was dead
to the world rises up and then outboxes

1678
01:35:26,630 --> 01:35:28,100
him for the rest of the round survives,

1679
01:35:28,280 --> 01:35:31,820
survives wilder chasing them down and
then outboxes him and then even tags

1680
01:35:31,821 --> 01:35:33,920
wilder as wilder to covering up.

1681
01:35:34,640 --> 01:35:37,420
That whole round doesn't take place if
you only fight it round because it will

1682
01:35:37,430 --> 01:35:40,910
be a test of endurance too. Right. Not
just strength and power for sure. Yeah.

1683
01:35:41,810 --> 01:35:45,950
I mean maybe if people were only fighting
eight rounds it would be worse because

1684
01:35:45,951 --> 01:35:48,600
they would, they would go harder.
Exactly. That's what I'm saying. Yeah.

1685
01:35:49,100 --> 01:35:52,340
And there'd be worse fights cause you
exert all your energy in the first three,

1686
01:35:52,341 --> 01:35:56,630
four, three, five rounds.
The only argument against
that though is kickboxing.

1687
01:35:56,870 --> 01:36:00,230
Cause in kickboxing they've always
had less rounds. Like um, kickboxing,

1688
01:36:00,440 --> 01:36:01,280
Muay Thai fine.

1689
01:36:01,610 --> 01:36:04,310
Like a lot of times they'll fight three
rounds or they'll fight five rounds.

1690
01:36:04,720 --> 01:36:08,090
I never, I mean come on. I mean
cause it's that, that's yeah,

1691
01:36:08,340 --> 01:36:09,520
that like that's fine saying,

1692
01:36:09,540 --> 01:36:11,690
I mean you're talking about tree trunks
hitting somebody. You know what I mean?

1693
01:36:11,720 --> 01:36:14,200
So awful. That should only
be three to five rounds.

1694
01:36:14,330 --> 01:36:16,930
That's never gotten a Charlie horse
like a really bad truck. Yeah.

1695
01:36:17,030 --> 01:36:19,940
I want to like recently where like
my whole leg stopped and I was like,

1696
01:36:19,970 --> 01:36:22,880
this is possible. I didn't know as
possible. Your whole lake and stuff,

1697
01:36:22,881 --> 01:36:25,400
just from a Charlie horse.
There's, there's levels to it.

1698
01:36:25,401 --> 01:36:28,160
But the worst I ever saw was chosen.

1699
01:36:28,161 --> 01:36:31,130
Aldo fought Uriah faber and uh,

1700
01:36:31,860 --> 01:36:34,610
Josie Aldo was one of the most vicious
leg kickers in the history of the sport.

1701
01:36:35,120 --> 01:36:39,140
God has led. Kicks were insane. Well,
years this, I hadn't seen this fight.

1702
01:36:39,560 --> 01:36:43,850
2012 maybe someone's like, what a favors.
Like what? Like vice before he like,

1703
01:36:43,851 --> 01:36:46,550
he's like he's becoming big
at that point. 2012. Yes.

1704
01:36:46,760 --> 01:36:49,790
And was fighting for the title. It was
for the featherweight title, I believe,

1705
01:36:49,791 --> 01:36:54,500
or the WEC title boy. I feel like that
was like, okay, this is what it was.

1706
01:36:54,620 --> 01:36:59,320
If I'm correct, I think it was,
I think I'm incorrect. Yeah.

1707
01:37:00,320 --> 01:37:04,790
Is that a, is that in the WC? Yes, it is.

1708
01:37:04,850 --> 01:37:09,850
So I think what this was was the
UFC and the WC had a paper view,

1709
01:37:10,310 --> 01:37:14,840
but it was just, they didn't,
it wasn't quite the UFC yet,

1710
01:37:14,930 --> 01:37:16,520
so I don't think they called it anything.

1711
01:37:16,520 --> 01:37:20,480
I think they just called it
all though versus favor and uh,

1712
01:37:20,481 --> 01:37:21,710
the UFC promoted it.

1713
01:37:21,740 --> 01:37:25,860
I think that was how they got
around something we tried to do.

1714
01:37:26,170 --> 01:37:30,080
Dude that is all doe in its prime sun.
That is that combination right there.

1715
01:37:30,081 --> 01:37:33,350
It's called the Dutchy where they throw
a left hook to the body and the right

1716
01:37:33,351 --> 01:37:37,430
leg kick. But this just showed you how
God damn tough. You're right. Favorites.

1717
01:37:37,730 --> 01:37:41,180
The impressive performance for
sure off offensively. I mean,

1718
01:37:41,210 --> 01:37:43,580
although it was in his
full prime, it was amazing.

1719
01:37:44,090 --> 01:37:48,470
But what's really impressive is
how Uriah faber was able to endure.

1720
01:37:49,040 --> 01:37:51,350
I mean it was how many
rounds does this go?

1721
01:37:51,620 --> 01:37:55,980
It went the full distance
full five rounds. What's

1722
01:37:55,980 --> 01:38:00,810
that? Yeah. Then you see his legs
after fucking crazy man. Yeah.

1723
01:38:01,350 --> 01:38:06,300
When did they start doing um, five
round main events for the UFC?

1724
01:38:07,320 --> 01:38:09,750
That was an early, or they, I
don't think they grew to that.

1725
01:38:09,810 --> 01:38:13,600
I feel like I'm remembering it's, it's
been this way for quite a while. So it's,

1726
01:38:13,920 --> 01:38:18,780
it's hard to remember the exact year,
but they, they didn't use to 2011, 2011.

1727
01:38:18,840 --> 01:38:20,280
Oh, so this is like this decade 11.

1728
01:38:20,790 --> 01:38:23,220
That's when they started going
to five rounds from main events.

1729
01:38:23,250 --> 01:38:26,830
UFC Dana White says all UFC made
events to become five rounds. Right.

1730
01:38:26,850 --> 01:38:30,930
But before that championship
fights were championship fights,

1731
01:38:30,960 --> 01:38:34,740
always five rounds. Trying to go
back to the early, early days.

1732
01:38:35,520 --> 01:38:36,181
At this point,

1733
01:38:36,181 --> 01:38:39,720
five round fights have been contested
or contests have been reserved for title

1734
01:38:39,721 --> 01:38:41,130
fights all. Yeah, that's what I had said.

1735
01:38:41,131 --> 01:38:44,070
But w when did they make them
five rounds for title fights?

1736
01:38:45,070 --> 01:38:48,330
Know when did they decide that a title
fights five rounds and a regular fight?

1737
01:38:48,331 --> 01:38:51,900
Three rounds. Well it was that wonder
if that was from the beginning.

1738
01:38:52,740 --> 01:38:55,050
Cause you gotta remember in the
beginning days they didn't even have time

1739
01:38:55,051 --> 01:38:57,330
limits. Really? No.

1740
01:38:57,630 --> 01:39:00,360
Well it was just you go into
like somebody's got a lot
of fights where there was

1741
01:39:00,361 --> 01:39:01,860
no time limits. They were terrible.

1742
01:39:02,040 --> 01:39:05,520
And you just fought until like somebody
tapped up. Yeah, I looked that up. Look,

1743
01:39:05,521 --> 01:39:06,660
especially in Japan,

1744
01:39:07,170 --> 01:39:11,190
like hoist Gracie had a fight with
Sakuraba that went like 90 minutes. Damn.

1745
01:39:11,300 --> 01:39:16,140
Yeah. Why? Well in Japan they,

1746
01:39:16,170 --> 01:39:19,070
they didn't, they had a,

1747
01:39:19,150 --> 01:39:21,300
a different way of
looking at these contests.

1748
01:39:21,360 --> 01:39:25,580
They would make crazy matchups where
there was a, you can't win by, um,

1749
01:39:25,850 --> 01:39:28,310
decision. You could only win by knockout.

1750
01:39:28,320 --> 01:39:32,760
They would like cro cop who was
like one of the greatest, um,

1751
01:39:33,600 --> 01:39:38,070
strikers in MMA ever because he came
from k one kickboxing and he was big and

1752
01:39:38,370 --> 01:39:40,870
Katelyn kickbox and then
made his way over to um,

1753
01:39:40,950 --> 01:39:44,670
to Japan and started fighting and
pride. And the first time he fought,

1754
01:39:44,671 --> 01:39:47,500
he fought Vandelay Silva. It
was like a big [inaudible],

1755
01:39:48,060 --> 01:39:51,970
but they had a special rules match
and the special rules was, um,

1756
01:39:51,990 --> 01:39:54,660
if it went to a decision, it
was a draw no matter what.

1757
01:39:54,661 --> 01:39:57,540
If no one got knocked out,
it was a draw. And um,

1758
01:39:57,600 --> 01:40:02,370
if they fought on the ground, it
can only be for like 15 seconds.

1759
01:40:02,700 --> 01:40:03,840
It's like some crazy rule.

1760
01:40:03,960 --> 01:40:06,150
It was basically just boxing
and order does kickboxing,

1761
01:40:06,270 --> 01:40:07,770
I forget what the amount of time was,

1762
01:40:07,771 --> 01:40:10,710
but there was a limited amount of time
where they could fight on the ground.

1763
01:40:10,740 --> 01:40:13,800
Yeah. So I think that must have
been better for us. That's crazy.

1764
01:40:14,220 --> 01:40:17,220
Cro Cop had the balls to step into MMA,

1765
01:40:17,350 --> 01:40:20,970
like really with very
little real MMA training.

1766
01:40:21,050 --> 01:40:22,900
It was mostly just as a kickboxer.

1767
01:40:23,220 --> 01:40:25,710
But then he started as
his career got further,

1768
01:40:25,711 --> 01:40:28,920
he got better and better at stuff and
takedowns but so Japan would do that.

1769
01:40:28,920 --> 01:40:31,830
They would make like they would make
fights where one guy, where's a g,

1770
01:40:31,831 --> 01:40:34,320
the other guy doesn't, they
would make fights with,

1771
01:40:34,350 --> 01:40:38,090
they made fights with Bob Sapp who
was like 370 pounds against the guys.

1772
01:40:38,100 --> 01:40:42,780
200 pounds. [inaudible] the guy
smashes him. That's a smash.

1773
01:40:42,820 --> 01:40:44,850
They made a bunch of
like horrible mismatches.

1774
01:40:45,210 --> 01:40:49,350
They'd make mis like they'd make
Vandelay Silva fight someone who was just

1775
01:40:49,351 --> 01:40:52,410
deathly scared of him that was going to
get palms to the ground and they did it

1776
01:40:52,411 --> 01:40:55,690
just to watch. So you could watch
Vandelay smash somebody. Yeah,

1777
01:40:55,691 --> 01:40:58,270
they sound like circus messages.
They had crazy fights, man.

1778
01:40:58,330 --> 01:41:00,280
They had crazy fights. And you
went over there with the call?

1779
01:41:00,281 --> 01:41:02,530
The fights or just the watch? You'll
know. I only watched him here.

1780
01:41:02,531 --> 01:41:05,020
I've never been in Japan to
watch fights other than the UFC.

1781
01:41:05,021 --> 01:41:08,260
We did a UFC out there at once.
Yeah, that was fun. They're really,

1782
01:41:08,261 --> 01:41:12,430
really polite. Yeah. In between, like,
like while the actions happening,

1783
01:41:12,431 --> 01:41:14,080
they're sitting there quiet and polite.

1784
01:41:14,560 --> 01:41:17,380
Like you don't hear a lot
of like screaming and crazy.
I didn't know that. Yeah.

1785
01:41:17,381 --> 01:41:19,330
And then they get, they,
they're, they're very, uh,

1786
01:41:19,331 --> 01:41:22,810
they applaud like when things
happen, cause I know it's broadcast.

1787
01:41:23,350 --> 01:41:26,470
It's interesting. Yeah. It's gotta be
bad. It's not bad, but it is different.

1788
01:41:26,710 --> 01:41:30,040
Yeah. But like I'm like, I was like Tyson
and Buster Douglas like was that loud?

1789
01:41:30,160 --> 01:41:34,660
I wonder. I wonder. I don't, I don't
remember like all those fights over there.

1790
01:41:34,661 --> 01:41:37,090
Yeah. You're saying like the quiet, I
mean that would, that seems like it sucks.

1791
01:41:37,091 --> 01:41:40,210
But early on, early on they
were super knowledgeable.

1792
01:41:40,300 --> 01:41:44,170
Like early on in mixed martial arts.
Like if you watch fights or in Japan,

1793
01:41:44,171 --> 01:41:47,800
if somebody passed guard, everybody
would cheer. It's a little, yeah,

1794
01:41:47,801 --> 01:41:50,950
it's like a smart audience. Yeah. They
know exactly what's going on there.

1795
01:41:51,010 --> 01:41:52,870
They're well educated in
someone gets them out,

1796
01:41:53,260 --> 01:41:56,860
they start clapping and like
this a, it's just a different,

1797
01:41:57,670 --> 01:42:02,080
completely different kind of a reaction
for the audience. Political change.

1798
01:42:02,350 --> 01:42:05,590
It's cool though. It's like when
you watch the UFC events from Japan,

1799
01:42:05,770 --> 01:42:06,510
it's changing.

1800
01:42:06,510 --> 01:42:09,760
They're becoming a little bit more used
to like being rowdy and having a good

1801
01:42:09,761 --> 01:42:13,960
time. But in the old days you could
hear the corners crystal clear.

1802
01:42:14,720 --> 01:42:18,410
So the quantity the to press down with
the butterfly down with the butterfly.

1803
01:42:18,411 --> 01:42:21,070
Look out for the right arm. We have the
right arm. Okay, keep that over. Hook.

1804
01:42:21,071 --> 01:42:24,310
Keep that over hook. And you would hear
that like, but he could hear it too.

1805
01:42:24,400 --> 01:42:25,710
Everybody could hear it. So the,

1806
01:42:25,840 --> 01:42:30,100
the guy who you're fighting is hearing
the advice against the shit crystal clear

1807
01:42:30,101 --> 01:42:34,450
cause there's, there's no noise.
I mean that must make fights.

1808
01:42:34,960 --> 01:42:37,300
I mean like, yeah, just long and boring
cause they all know like your strategy.

1809
01:42:37,310 --> 01:42:39,550
No, no, no, no. Crazy, crazy.

1810
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:42,040
Just to get someone knows that you're
trying to get their arm doesn't mean

1811
01:42:42,041 --> 01:42:46,600
you're not going to get their arm.
It's still crazy. It's still crazy.

1812
01:42:46,840 --> 01:42:47,650
But it's um,

1813
01:42:47,650 --> 01:42:51,610
it was really interesting because you
could hear everything you hear yelling

1814
01:42:51,611 --> 01:42:55,600
out. There's nothing like Vegas. Yeah.
Vegas just like anybody screaming. Yeah.

1815
01:42:55,630 --> 01:42:57,180
Well, you know what's, I find the,

1816
01:42:57,610 --> 01:43:00,850
sometimes the most enthusiastic crowds
are the ones that don't get the UFC there

1817
01:43:00,851 --> 01:43:04,210
very often. So when it does get
there, they get fucking super pumped.

1818
01:43:04,410 --> 01:43:07,120
I can't believe it's their
live, you know, like where,

1819
01:43:09,430 --> 01:43:10,263
uh,

1820
01:43:10,570 --> 01:43:15,570
I mean there's a lot of cities where
we've gone to were like all Texas always

1821
01:43:15,641 --> 01:43:19,560
says wild ass. I mean, that makes sense.
Yeah. That's a good place for USC.

1822
01:43:20,860 --> 01:43:24,250
But there's a lot of cities that just
don't get it all the time. Chicago,

1823
01:43:24,251 --> 01:43:26,740
whenever we were in Chicago, it's
big. You've never been to Chicago.

1824
01:43:26,741 --> 01:43:30,910
There's been, oh, we go, yeah, we're in
Chicago. I go to Chicago all the time.

1825
01:43:31,300 --> 01:43:33,950
It's a big drink and towns though.
Fuck yeah, like I feel like, yeah,

1826
01:43:33,960 --> 01:43:36,330
any like biters had a big drinking town,
there's going to be like this isn't,

1827
01:43:36,520 --> 01:43:39,610
yeah, it doesn't matter what it is. Yeah.

1828
01:43:39,611 --> 01:43:42,460
So when we were talking about
reparations earlier like that,

1829
01:43:42,520 --> 01:43:46,420
I don't think they should give money
to people like individual money.

1830
01:43:46,450 --> 01:43:48,850
That's what I'm saying. But what I think
they should do is definitely put money.

1831
01:43:48,910 --> 01:43:52,520
Like if you, if you were
a guy who was the manager

1832
01:43:52,520 --> 01:43:56,540
of a city, let's look at that. Let's
look at the city like a city was a store.

1833
01:43:56,690 --> 01:43:59,660
Okay. And you're the manager
of the store and, but the,

1834
01:43:59,661 --> 01:44:02,360
the section over near the
cleaning products, it's,

1835
01:44:02,361 --> 01:44:05,600
everything explodes all the
time and it's fucking dangerous.

1836
01:44:05,601 --> 01:44:08,180
And mops are fallen and you're
like, well, we got, you know,

1837
01:44:08,181 --> 01:44:12,640
several things in order. City's good
revenue looks good. Like, wait, wait babe,

1838
01:44:12,820 --> 01:44:15,290
babe, buddy. What the fuck are you
talking about? You're the manager.

1839
01:44:15,530 --> 01:44:19,250
What are you doing about this? Look at
this spot. He was like, what? Oh no,

1840
01:44:19,251 --> 01:44:20,990
that's a, the cleaning products. I mean,

1841
01:44:20,991 --> 01:44:23,120
I don't know what to do about the
cleaning products. They explode.

1842
01:44:23,240 --> 01:44:26,930
The mops fall off the racks.
I just waved my hands at it.

1843
01:44:27,410 --> 01:44:32,270
You would never tolerate that. No.
But a mayor like that, Pete Buddha,

1844
01:44:32,271 --> 01:44:34,330
judge, a good judge guy. Yeah.

1845
01:44:34,490 --> 01:44:39,490
He could have all sorts of chaos going
on in his town while he's out there

1846
01:44:39,711 --> 01:44:44,070
campaigning for president. Right?
Yeah. Nobody cares. Nobody cares.

1847
01:44:44,120 --> 01:44:46,550
You don't have to fix it. You don't
have to fix it. Yeah. But I'd be like,

1848
01:44:46,551 --> 01:44:48,680
well how do you feel like I'm what I'm
saying it's an infrastructure problem.

1849
01:44:48,681 --> 01:44:49,580
So how do you fix it?

1850
01:44:49,840 --> 01:44:53,150
So you're saying take what 15% or whatever
percentage from like all these big

1851
01:44:53,151 --> 01:44:55,440
corporations and they're like, they
should be paying even saying that. Right.

1852
01:44:55,640 --> 01:44:59,060
I'm boot up a little. What I was saying
though, if there was a direct line,

1853
01:44:59,430 --> 01:45:01,970
I mean I don't know if you can do
this anymore at this point in time,

1854
01:45:01,971 --> 01:45:05,870
but if there was a direct way you could
show this is the amount of money that

1855
01:45:05,871 --> 01:45:08,530
came from slavery and they still have,

1856
01:45:08,540 --> 01:45:12,380
I mean how are you finding
that out though? I don't
know. Yeah, there's no way,

1857
01:45:12,381 --> 01:45:14,240
because by the way, we can't
even trace like, you know what,

1858
01:45:14,300 --> 01:45:17,150
I don't know what tree plantation I
was even at, you know what I mean?

1859
01:45:17,420 --> 01:45:20,830
Where my family lineage is. Well there
was a bunch of Nazi money that they cha,

1860
01:45:20,900 --> 01:45:24,110
they traced, they've traced Nazi
money. They've definitely done that.

1861
01:45:24,140 --> 01:45:26,200
They've definitely done that
with a little more modern though.

1862
01:45:26,201 --> 01:45:30,500
I mean say from 16 or
15 or 14 till you know,

1863
01:45:30,680 --> 01:45:34,340
1860 something. Yeah. We're dealing
with like an 80 year gap. Yeah,

1864
01:45:35,420 --> 01:45:36,253
it'd be hard.

1865
01:45:36,410 --> 01:45:39,830
But if there was like some clearly
established business that used to be a

1866
01:45:39,831 --> 01:45:43,670
plantation. Right. You
know, I'm also, you know,

1867
01:45:43,700 --> 01:45:46,640
Jewish people can't y'all keep
things into account so like you can,

1868
01:45:46,670 --> 01:45:49,490
you can trace that money. Like there
was no, here's an unpopular thought,

1869
01:45:49,540 --> 01:45:50,810
this is, this is what I think.

1870
01:45:50,990 --> 01:45:55,990
I think we should probably consider doing
that with definitely areas that were

1871
01:45:57,351 --> 01:45:58,550
impacted by slavery.

1872
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:03,950
But then also areas that have been
impacted by economic crisis too.

1873
01:46:04,160 --> 01:46:08,540
Like not just the areas impacted by
like we have to fix the bad spots in the

1874
01:46:08,541 --> 01:46:10,940
country. All told like full stop.

1875
01:46:10,941 --> 01:46:14,360
Like we kinda fixed those people that
live in West Virginia. In the mountains.

1876
01:46:14,390 --> 01:46:17,800
Yeah. The fucking pill. People.
Any, any Troy community. Yeah.

1877
01:46:17,960 --> 01:46:19,160
Any poor community. Yeah.

1878
01:46:19,220 --> 01:46:24,220
But first like as a general
acknowledgement of like
what this country was

1879
01:46:24,291 --> 01:46:27,800
founded on, you've got to fix the
areas that were fucked up by slavery.

1880
01:46:28,040 --> 01:46:32,780
The idea that you shouldn't, it's
like, aren't we on a team together?

1881
01:46:32,810 --> 01:46:34,940
Okay. Aren't we team America? Right. Well,

1882
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:39,230
team America would want all of its
members to be in good shape, good state.

1883
01:46:39,231 --> 01:46:42,380
We want less losers. Yeah. Right.
Here's the way you get less losers.

1884
01:46:42,381 --> 01:46:46,100
You provide more opportunity and you
fix the spots that are fucked up.

1885
01:46:46,640 --> 01:46:49,260
And there's no, that comes with
education though, Joe. I mean,

1886
01:46:49,261 --> 01:46:50,000
you're talking about,

1887
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:52,770
I mean, there'll be, the illiteracy
rate is crazy down there.

1888
01:46:52,771 --> 01:46:55,230
So you're saying the idiots, you know
what I mean? But it's like, no, no, no.

1889
01:46:55,690 --> 01:46:59,850
Yeah, they're idiots. What I'm saying
is they're stuck your horrible place.

1890
01:47:00,210 --> 01:47:02,640
Right. You're an idiot if you
don't want to fix that. No,

1891
01:47:02,810 --> 01:47:07,540
that's what I get that I think
it's just unpopular. Like no,

1892
01:47:07,620 --> 01:47:08,910
like here's what everybody wants to hear.

1893
01:47:08,930 --> 01:47:11,410
We want to go to out of Afghanistan
and I don't know. Right.

1894
01:47:12,740 --> 01:47:15,410
We want to provide free
healthcare for everyone. Yeah.

1895
01:47:16,130 --> 01:47:19,610
We think that education
should be free. Ah,

1896
01:47:19,611 --> 01:47:21,420
I'm going to give you
$1,000 a month. Yeah.

1897
01:47:23,330 --> 01:47:27,440
But no one's saying art, our whole thing.

1898
01:47:27,470 --> 01:47:31,520
If we looked at it as an
ecosystem, there's disease spots,

1899
01:47:31,700 --> 01:47:35,510
there's spots where it's not going
well, it's sick, it's not doing well.

1900
01:47:35,600 --> 01:47:38,000
There's too much crime,
there's too much pollution,

1901
01:47:38,030 --> 01:47:40,280
there's too much environmental
factors, whatever the,

1902
01:47:40,281 --> 01:47:43,820
whatever the factors are taken
advantage of communities delivers those,

1903
01:47:43,910 --> 01:47:46,670
whether it's environmental factors
like the water in Flint, Michigan,

1904
01:47:47,060 --> 01:47:48,800
or whether it is a crime,

1905
01:47:49,100 --> 01:47:52,640
Britain's streets of Baltimore or
Philly or wherever, wherever it is,

1906
01:47:52,641 --> 01:47:54,980
where it's bad, we'll
find spots where it's bad.

1907
01:47:55,370 --> 01:47:58,700
Those spots have to be
addressed, like you don't,

1908
01:47:58,701 --> 01:48:00,410
just to address it with law enforcement,

1909
01:48:00,900 --> 01:48:05,840
you got to figure out a plan to
slowly reinvigorate those spots.

1910
01:48:06,020 --> 01:48:07,640
We have. There's no severe,

1911
01:48:08,160 --> 01:48:09,580
pretty laughing. I like what
you were saying earlier,

1912
01:48:09,581 --> 01:48:12,130
even about the Italian cities, how they
do have the mamma pop thing, you know,

1913
01:48:12,210 --> 01:48:14,590
we keep the money in the community,
right? They haven't sold out to the,

1914
01:48:14,650 --> 01:48:17,680
to the corporations who are just
like draining those, those, you know,

1915
01:48:17,681 --> 01:48:20,980
those communities. Right. But the thing
is, it's like, it's so tourism based,

1916
01:48:21,190 --> 01:48:23,400
the kind of don't have to
because it's like this.

1917
01:48:23,470 --> 01:48:26,740
The places where I'm going to it.
Like, uh, I went to the mall fee coast,

1918
01:48:26,770 --> 01:48:29,940
which is like really popular for
tourism and uh, you know, you go,

1919
01:48:29,980 --> 01:48:30,791
you go to these places,

1920
01:48:30,791 --> 01:48:33,970
there's no incentive cause
there's people there all the time.

1921
01:48:34,260 --> 01:48:34,990
But I'm saying like,

1922
01:48:34,990 --> 01:48:37,420
there's no incentive to give
into corporation instead of like,

1923
01:48:37,430 --> 01:48:39,010
my parents had to having to go to Cosco.

1924
01:48:39,011 --> 01:48:40,840
Maybe there's like a hardware store
down the street that you know,

1925
01:48:40,841 --> 01:48:42,730
has like I'm trying to go to
Pete's cause he's got, you know,

1926
01:48:42,731 --> 01:48:45,000
he's got camera's over here. So you
keep the money in the community.

1927
01:48:45,280 --> 01:48:47,410
Like I think we're like local grocers,
that kind of thing. You know, like,

1928
01:48:47,411 --> 01:48:50,320
Oh hey, I'm not going to go to a bond
or a routes. I'm just going to go to,

1929
01:48:50,560 --> 01:48:53,530
you know, Edna's cause she's got,
you know, the cabbages I like. Yeah,

1930
01:48:53,531 --> 01:48:56,020
but what if you don't have that,

1931
01:48:56,620 --> 01:48:59,560
then the only thing you
got is target or Walgreens.

1932
01:48:59,561 --> 01:49:02,320
Like he's got to deal with what I'm
saying. But that's, that's, you know,

1933
01:49:02,321 --> 01:49:04,690
that's there. That's the,
those poor communities.

1934
01:49:04,691 --> 01:49:06,520
I'm saying like they're putting those
there and they're just draining.

1935
01:49:06,521 --> 01:49:08,530
Those people have just like, you know,
maybe getting opportunities that,

1936
01:49:08,531 --> 01:49:09,430
you know, they, they, they,

1937
01:49:09,460 --> 01:49:12,490
they can thrive in like Italian
communities you're saying? Yeah. It's,

1938
01:49:12,770 --> 01:49:15,850
they also make it financially
almost impossible to compete.

1939
01:49:15,970 --> 01:49:20,530
Like you can't sell things as cheap as
they can. Right. They get better deals.

1940
01:49:20,680 --> 01:49:23,650
Like if you have a mom and pop shop and
you're selling like shovels or stuff

1941
01:49:23,651 --> 01:49:27,820
like that almost is home depot. Home
Depot is, we made these ourselves.

1942
01:49:27,821 --> 01:49:28,654
I don't give a fuck.

1943
01:49:29,040 --> 01:49:33,040
Those shuffles would be like $5 less
and that's all anybody cares about that.

1944
01:49:33,100 --> 01:49:36,100
That's a problem. All right, well then
how do you build infrastructure then?

1945
01:49:36,190 --> 01:49:38,680
I mean, I'm saying incentivize parents
because like that's gonna like, you know,

1946
01:49:38,681 --> 01:49:40,030
help those guys. Like maybe, you know,

1947
01:49:40,150 --> 01:49:43,450
it's got the whole family figure out what
do we need to do about junior here or

1948
01:49:43,451 --> 01:49:43,940
you know,

1949
01:49:43,940 --> 01:49:46,510
a little little lady here and like
figure out how we're going to make them

1950
01:49:46,930 --> 01:49:48,190
better members of society.

1951
01:49:48,310 --> 01:49:51,370
I like that idea. Yeah.
I mean, I think that if,

1952
01:49:51,580 --> 01:49:55,150
if we could figure out how much they
would get and where the money would come

1953
01:49:55,151 --> 01:49:58,420
from and if it did work,
it would be insane. Yeah.

1954
01:49:58,540 --> 01:50:02,740
I mean you think about how much money
you have to spend on the criminal justice

1955
01:50:02,741 --> 01:50:07,360
system on healthcare system from assaults
and all sorts of things when when

1956
01:50:07,361 --> 01:50:09,200
people go bad. Yeah.

1957
01:50:09,490 --> 01:50:14,490
And what would you say save if buy ins
through incentivizing education and

1958
01:50:15,221 --> 01:50:19,810
making sure that people get compensated
financially for, for education success.

1959
01:50:20,230 --> 01:50:23,110
And then all of a sudden it starts
booming and then you have way less crime.

1960
01:50:23,111 --> 01:50:25,440
That would be amazing. I'm
saying Bro, I mean that,

1961
01:50:25,441 --> 01:50:27,550
that almost feels like it's
a no brainer, you know?

1962
01:50:27,551 --> 01:50:31,040
I mean you're talking about
infrastructure, that's
infrastructure. Hey Dude,

1963
01:50:31,290 --> 01:50:34,810
bunch run for president. Any other awesome
ideas? Cause that's an awesome idea.

1964
01:50:34,900 --> 01:50:37,570
I gotta look, I'm an
obviously a financial moron.

1965
01:50:38,050 --> 01:50:40,240
I don't know if that would
actually how much that would cost,

1966
01:50:40,690 --> 01:50:43,690
but if it could be done, how much
preparations? More cost. I mean,

1967
01:50:43,691 --> 01:50:45,070
like I hear it keeps,
you know, and they keep,

1968
01:50:45,130 --> 01:50:47,740
they keep saying we need to have it,
but it's like, what does that mean?

1969
01:50:47,741 --> 01:50:50,890
Is there an, is that an infrastructure
thing or are we just giving people money?

1970
01:50:51,130 --> 01:50:54,700
Isn't that a weird one? Because it
keeps coming up. Yeah. It's like,

1971
01:50:54,701 --> 01:50:56,920
it comes up and then it goes away
and it's like, hey, you know,

1972
01:50:56,921 --> 01:50:59,770
we never fucking sorted this
out. I mean, I'll tell you this.

1973
01:50:59,771 --> 01:51:03,010
I remember on a guy that was bully
hunter, he put on Twitter, he put,

1974
01:51:03,011 --> 01:51:05,410
it's been [inaudible]. He said, white
people, if you wanna give me reparations,

1975
01:51:05,411 --> 01:51:08,970
my bin Mo's open. And he made like, I
don't know, like 100 bucks. And then a,

1976
01:51:09,010 --> 01:51:12,460
we went on the road and then, yeah,
we all, he bought us a skittles,

1977
01:51:12,580 --> 01:51:16,960
beautiful ice tea and Hennessy
reparation money. That's just like,

1978
01:51:17,080 --> 01:51:18,730
you can't do that with the community man.

1979
01:51:18,760 --> 01:51:23,620
Do you ever see where an m hotep Jesus
walked into Starbucks? Oh Jeez, man.

1980
01:51:23,720 --> 01:51:27,910
And his a reparation coffee nine.
He saw the interesting character.

1981
01:51:27,911 --> 01:51:31,120
I've had him on my
podcast, but he, um, he,

1982
01:51:31,810 --> 01:51:35,600
there was a Starbucks had got busted
for telling these young black guys that

1983
01:51:35,610 --> 01:51:37,710
they had to leave. Um,

1984
01:51:37,900 --> 01:51:41,680
and it became a big deal where they
developed a new policy where they're never

1985
01:51:41,681 --> 01:51:43,060
going to just tell people to leave.

1986
01:51:43,360 --> 01:51:44,680
And so the problem with
that was they'd be like,

1987
01:51:44,740 --> 01:51:45,930
well what about homeless people?

1988
01:51:45,950 --> 01:51:48,370
Now you've got homeless people that have
liked to hang around Starbucks and the

1989
01:51:48,371 --> 01:51:51,890
policy is they can't even tell them to
leave, but she's like, all these days,

1990
01:51:51,891 --> 01:51:53,700
and I go, this black people in
homeless people now Starbucks,

1991
01:51:53,830 --> 01:51:56,610
this story was really a,

1992
01:51:56,620 --> 01:52:00,190
it was big in the news that Starbucks
was racist and that they had kicked.

1993
01:52:00,340 --> 01:52:02,980
So Starbucks was like
apologizing publicly.

1994
01:52:03,250 --> 01:52:05,380
So while that was going on in hotep Jesus,

1995
01:52:05,381 --> 01:52:06,850
like I'm going to go get some free coffee,

1996
01:52:09,010 --> 01:52:11,860
went into coffee and he goes
out here, I'm a, I have a,

1997
01:52:11,861 --> 01:52:14,590
I get my reparations coffee.
I'm here to get coffee for free.

1998
01:52:14,591 --> 01:52:18,250
Cause I heard y'all were racist. And
so the lady's like, yeah, I heard that.

1999
01:52:18,251 --> 01:52:20,800
And she could pour him a cup of
coffee. She gives them a cup of coffee.

2000
01:52:20,801 --> 01:52:22,030
I heard the love though.

2001
01:52:22,180 --> 01:52:25,230
She heard that there was something
racist going so she had a free coffee to,

2002
01:52:25,450 --> 01:52:30,130
it's hilarious shit. Hotep Jesus.
It's hilarious. But it's um, you know,

2003
01:52:30,131 --> 01:52:34,480
Starbucks eat like anybody can go in
there now. Yeah. But it's all, you know,

2004
01:52:34,580 --> 01:52:36,640
whatever coffee. You
still your big coffee guy.

2005
01:52:36,670 --> 01:52:40,240
I'm not a big guy with number two.
I'm a black tea guy. Dude of coffee.

2006
01:52:41,020 --> 01:52:45,160
We got a new coffee from Onnit called
Fuck Yak coffee. I'm scared to try.

2007
01:52:45,710 --> 01:52:46,220
Apparently

2008
01:52:46,220 --> 01:52:48,890
it's a w did you see it? Did you see
the bag? I have some. I've tried it.

2009
01:52:49,220 --> 01:52:52,910
It's fucking ridiculous. I mean, but
it's got caffeine crystals in it. Yeah.

2010
01:52:52,920 --> 01:52:54,230
I was trying to, I didn't
know what that meant,

2011
01:52:54,320 --> 01:52:55,970
but how much caffeine
does it have? I couldn't,

2012
01:52:55,971 --> 01:52:59,120
I just made a French press of it,
so I couldn't tell you off the wall.

2013
01:52:59,210 --> 01:53:01,190
I don't even think, I think just like,

2014
01:53:01,380 --> 01:53:03,140
we don't think caffeine
affects me like normal people.

2015
01:53:03,141 --> 01:53:07,580
Does it actually take to Jamie's
robot? Jamie takes edibles.

2016
01:53:07,581 --> 01:53:11,780
They don't do a damn thing. Oh
my God. I tried to Trey. Yeah.

2017
01:53:11,990 --> 01:53:15,550
Do not get into an editable
eating contest with Jamie. Yo,

2018
01:53:16,210 --> 01:53:19,330
that's $1 million idea. He's a
rateable, you'll kill people. He'll,

2019
01:53:19,331 --> 01:53:22,600
he's a robot. He just throws him down.
They don't do a goddamn thing to him.

2020
01:53:23,390 --> 01:53:27,170
Yeah. One, one out of 20 times.
Maybe a small effect, but yeah. Yeah.

2021
01:53:27,171 --> 01:53:29,900
But like a small effect
for like 500 milligrams.

2022
01:53:30,620 --> 01:53:32,850
He's got really good chicken
thousand. I took a thousand. Yeah,

2023
01:53:32,940 --> 01:53:36,350
I'd play some video games and four
hours later I was like, all right,

2024
01:53:36,351 --> 01:53:38,990
I'm a little tired. I want
it. I'll stop. You got, yeah.

2025
01:53:38,991 --> 01:53:39,900
You got like that gene though.

2026
01:53:40,100 --> 01:53:41,960
He was like a gene that
actually let's go back to HIV.

2027
01:53:42,030 --> 01:53:45,130
There was a gene that some like people
have like you can't get it. Yes.

2028
01:53:45,140 --> 01:53:49,100
There's some people that with your edibles
here movie about that where like they

2029
01:53:49,101 --> 01:53:53,420
use a guy to, cause he's got the one
g oh, what is that God damn movie?

2030
01:53:53,960 --> 01:53:58,040
I feel like I've seen it recently.
Oh, I did. Okay. Here's what it is.

2031
01:53:59,190 --> 01:53:59,540
Um,

2032
01:53:59,540 --> 01:54:04,540
it's called the man who shot Hitler and
then big foot and I saw it recently.

2033
01:54:05,421 --> 01:54:09,800
It's a Sam Elliot movie.
Whoa. Okay. It actually, wow.

2034
01:54:09,860 --> 01:54:13,550
It is an interesting movie and he
can't get it strictly. I enjoyed it.

2035
01:54:13,551 --> 01:54:17,480
I watched it on a flight and I downloaded
it cause I was like, what is this?

2036
01:54:17,780 --> 01:54:19,940
What is the man who shot
Hitler? And then big foot,

2037
01:54:19,941 --> 01:54:24,710
but I'm a big Sam Elliot Fan and
it got [inaudible]. So, uh, I said,

2038
01:54:25,130 --> 01:54:28,130
okay, I'll give it a shot.
It's really interesting.

2039
01:54:28,970 --> 01:54:32,600
I mean he, I mean it's,
they're not hiding it.

2040
01:54:32,720 --> 01:54:36,380
He shot big foot and then Hitler, the
man who killed Hitler and then bigfoot.

2041
01:54:36,560 --> 01:54:39,620
When did those come out? I don't
know. And he can't get HIV.

2042
01:54:39,900 --> 01:54:43,940
Last year the thing was that
he had a very specific gene.

2043
01:54:44,300 --> 01:54:47,300
They brought him back to service
because after he'd killed Hitler,

2044
01:54:47,301 --> 01:54:48,134
he's an older man,

2045
01:54:48,410 --> 01:54:53,320
but he had a very specific gene that
made him immune to this disease that big

2046
01:54:53,321 --> 01:54:58,321
foot had and that big foot was sick
and that his virus was killing all the

2047
01:55:00,060 --> 01:55:03,110
wildlife that was anywhere near him.

2048
01:55:03,140 --> 01:55:06,770
And there was a dead zone around big when
they were tracking him and they had to

2049
01:55:06,771 --> 01:55:08,930
have someone go in
there and kill big foot.

2050
01:55:09,170 --> 01:55:12,380
So they bring in Sam Elliot
when he's like 70 years old.

2051
01:55:12,950 --> 01:55:17,900
Spoiler alert to go and kill bigfoot.
It's fucking cool. I enjoyed it man.

2052
01:55:18,350 --> 01:55:22,250
I mean it's not, it's not, you
know, 2001 a space odyssey,

2053
01:55:22,251 --> 01:55:25,630
but it's fucking cool moving. It's a
definitely a B movie. I mean, damn,

2054
01:55:25,631 --> 01:55:30,290
I didn't get, is that bigfoot
where this little shadow thing? No,

2055
01:55:30,291 --> 01:55:33,320
they see I'm pretty up close. I mean
maybe they don't show it in the preview,

2056
01:55:33,321 --> 01:55:35,750
but it's pretty up close. It's gnarly.

2057
01:55:37,520 --> 01:55:40,640
I don't want to say too much. Yeah,
don't completely say too much.

2058
01:55:40,670 --> 01:55:44,070
But he does kill Hitler. Yeah. Well
killed Hitler and then, and then big foot.

2059
01:55:44,071 --> 01:55:46,380
It says it in the title. People
really want to kill Hitler.

2060
01:55:46,650 --> 01:55:50,840
That's like a thing that movies are
doing, Huh? Yeah, yeah. You know,

2061
01:55:50,850 --> 01:55:54,840
I was watching a video of a Hitler
tweaking Hitler's on speed. You know,

2062
01:55:54,841 --> 01:55:55,674
he did a lot of speed.

2063
01:55:56,770 --> 01:55:59,730
He's got the 1936 Olympics and he's
sitting in the audience like this,

2064
01:56:00,200 --> 01:56:03,300
like tweet. I was like an actual
like footage of the actual footage.

2065
01:56:03,540 --> 01:56:08,040
Apparently somebody had taken it
and sped it up and uh, it made it,

2066
01:56:08,700 --> 01:56:11,790
uh, unrealistic just to show, like
make it look for these really, really,

2067
01:56:11,791 --> 01:56:14,100
really tweaking. And then, um,

2068
01:56:14,450 --> 01:56:19,450
it was hard to find for some people
to find the actual speed footage.

2069
01:56:19,800 --> 01:56:23,460
But this is, this is the actual
speed footage they believe.

2070
01:56:25,290 --> 01:56:29,580
Um, so he's just rocking
back and forth tweaking.

2071
01:56:30,360 --> 01:56:33,600
Wow. He does have crack head energy.
That's amazing. Good percent tweaking.

2072
01:56:34,200 --> 01:56:38,410
So I mean there's no way you rock like
that for next weekend. He's like 52.

2073
01:56:38,470 --> 01:56:40,710
Where's his left hand?
What is happening there?

2074
01:56:41,350 --> 01:56:45,300
He touches his left hand's got a glove
and he's rubbing a gun on his deck.

2075
01:56:45,650 --> 01:56:49,200
Go back to the, I'm gonna say that again.
Please replay. Please look at this.

2076
01:56:49,530 --> 01:56:52,980
How weird is that man? How weird is
it to see that guy go full screen?

2077
01:56:53,190 --> 01:56:56,460
So he jerks off with his
gun. He masturbates in a way.

2078
01:56:56,760 --> 01:57:00,510
He's literally just joking about a
gun. I don't think it's really gone,

2079
01:57:01,170 --> 01:57:03,360
but he's definitely got
his hand on his deck.

2080
01:57:04,290 --> 01:57:07,230
He's like a a guy who's freaking out.

2081
01:57:09,300 --> 01:57:11,310
It might mean, might as
well be a meth head. Right.

2082
01:57:11,620 --> 01:57:14,190
And you see how they let this
guy like, I mean look at him.

2083
01:57:14,490 --> 01:57:18,480
Something he's touching his
dick with so yet. Yeah, exactly.

2084
01:57:19,080 --> 01:57:21,570
There's some stuff. It looks
like more hands curled over.

2085
01:57:21,571 --> 01:57:23,400
It doesn't like he's got
something in his hand, Dude.

2086
01:57:23,401 --> 01:57:26,640
He's rubbing something on his
pecker. Do you have a cane? Oh,

2087
01:57:26,641 --> 01:57:30,570
he's running this cat. Oh
yeah, maybe. Is that it?

2088
01:57:31,620 --> 01:57:32,760
He's like look, go,

2089
01:57:32,790 --> 01:57:36,840
go towards the end of it and we'll pause
when you can see the hand right next to

2090
01:57:36,841 --> 01:57:41,820
his dick. So weird that
is moving now watch,

2091
01:57:41,910 --> 01:57:45,300
watch. When you see his hand,
get that bar out of the bottom.

2092
01:57:45,330 --> 01:57:48,270
There it is over the pants hand job
that he's giving himself. Look good.

2093
01:57:48,390 --> 01:57:51,960
He's got something in his hand and that's
something in his hand is in between

2094
01:57:51,961 --> 01:57:55,500
his legs. You said Kane, I mean you might
be right. You said, I mean you were,

2095
01:57:55,680 --> 01:57:58,160
you were joking about the gun, but I
mean it could be, it could be a cane,

2096
01:57:58,330 --> 01:58:00,810
it could be a Ruger, it might be a gun.

2097
01:58:00,840 --> 01:58:03,870
I think it looks more like cane now
that I'm looking at it. But either way.

2098
01:58:04,100 --> 01:58:06,750
Yeah, he's definitely rubbing as
the guy. He's, if Trump was on TV,

2099
01:58:06,751 --> 01:58:09,810
just tweaking, tweaking hard.

2100
01:58:10,410 --> 01:58:14,760
Oh Fuck China. Fuck these
fucking trade relations.

2101
01:58:15,880 --> 01:58:20,370
Fuck Jeff for your Epstein. Fuck all
these assholes tweaking. Just tweaking.

2102
01:58:20,430 --> 01:58:22,680
Could you imagine doesn't
he knows Jeff, right?

2103
01:58:22,740 --> 01:58:24,480
Jeff Epstein apparently knew him,

2104
01:58:25,180 --> 01:58:27,840
but apparently they had a falling out
over our mantra and I was reading a story

2105
01:58:27,841 --> 01:58:29,940
about it over a male, like
when he sold him or no,

2106
01:58:29,941 --> 01:58:34,080
they were both trying to buy some super
exclusive property that was like the

2107
01:58:34,081 --> 01:58:36,750
crown jewel. Palm Beach.

2108
01:58:37,290 --> 01:58:41,920
It was this a six acre mansion that
overlooks the ocean on the beach.

2109
01:58:41,921 --> 01:58:46,240
It's beautiful. And it's apparel have a
plantation for girls. Well these, yeah.

2110
01:58:46,300 --> 01:58:49,060
Well it's also one of those things
where like if you're in a part of these

2111
01:58:49,061 --> 01:58:49,860
communities,

2112
01:58:49,860 --> 01:58:53,770
there are certain properties that are
iconic and to own them it would elevate

2113
01:58:53,771 --> 01:58:57,130
your social status. Like did you
hear Trump bought the mansion?

2114
01:58:58,210 --> 01:59:01,630
[inaudible] so like Felicia
had like a name to it.

2115
01:59:01,631 --> 01:59:04,940
The places off the charts. If you,

2116
01:59:05,140 --> 01:59:09,820
you see it on TV, like you
get a a sense, what is this

2117
01:59:11,510 --> 01:59:13,780
county known to having
a famous walking stick.

2118
01:59:14,280 --> 01:59:16,780
[inaudible] I thought you were
showing Epstein and Trump. He did.

2119
01:59:16,840 --> 01:59:21,620
He did have the cane. Um,
what was the house? Google.

2120
01:59:21,970 --> 01:59:25,240
The, the House that they competed about.

2121
01:59:25,960 --> 01:59:30,290
Trump and him competed over a
house like maybe waterfalls. Well,

2122
01:59:30,460 --> 01:59:33,220
it's really old. I think
14 year olds in every room.

2123
01:59:33,610 --> 01:59:37,210
It's like if someone was like
a super billionaire character,

2124
01:59:37,690 --> 01:59:42,430
and I dunno, think of me, name some
famous man like the Hearst castle,

2125
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:44,980
Hearst castle for sale. They'd
all be trying to get it.

2126
01:59:45,310 --> 01:59:49,540
Trump and Epstein's friendship reportedly
soured after they fought over a $41

2127
01:59:49,540 --> 01:59:52,540
million palm beach mansion two
weeks after the homes auction.

2128
01:59:52,541 --> 01:59:57,250
Cops received a tip about underage
women in Epstein's house. Oh Shit.

2129
01:59:57,490 --> 01:59:58,790
That was [inaudible].

2130
01:59:59,650 --> 02:00:02,290
Let's see if they have pictures of
the place and that's a Taj Mahal.

2131
02:00:02,291 --> 02:00:06,070
Look at that thing. Yeah, that's
it. Yeah. Thanks gorgeous dude.

2132
02:00:06,190 --> 02:00:09,490
It's dope as fuck. The, the images
are insane. That's it right there.

2133
02:00:09,491 --> 02:00:12,670
Click on that. Look at that
place so that you get it.

2134
02:00:13,080 --> 02:00:15,760
They're fighting over who's got
the biggest dick on this beach?

2135
02:00:16,600 --> 02:00:19,780
If you own that motherfucker, you bought
that place. Like you're king baller.

2136
02:00:19,900 --> 02:00:23,650
Everybody wants to have the party
at your house. Right? I mean,

2137
02:00:23,800 --> 02:00:28,330
so I guess there's just a few of these
type of mansions down in Palm Beach,

2138
02:00:28,570 --> 02:00:31,770
but there's a lot of them.
I mean there's, you know,

2139
02:00:31,870 --> 02:00:34,120
I don't know what the
number is, but there's a,

2140
02:00:34,510 --> 02:00:38,050
a good solid number of them
competing against each other.

2141
02:00:38,320 --> 02:00:41,710
That's fucking incredible. It's sort of
like, um, like the White House. Well,

2142
02:00:41,800 --> 02:00:44,200
it's sorta like those houses in Malibu,

2143
02:00:44,470 --> 02:00:46,960
like there's some houses in
Malibu when you look at like,

2144
02:00:47,020 --> 02:00:51,610
there's one crazy mansion overlooking
the sea and then another one next to it.

2145
02:00:51,611 --> 02:00:54,910
Like the those I know live
in this neighborhood. I
don't live there either, man.

2146
02:00:55,140 --> 02:00:57,280
Oh Shit. They've burnt
mostly burnt to a crisp.

2147
02:00:58,510 --> 02:01:01,770
It did point to Mary
crazy fly over it now.

2148
02:01:01,840 --> 02:01:05,200
It's was like just so many
houses chart on just chart. Yeah,

2149
02:01:05,380 --> 02:01:09,040
but there was houses where the people
do live with that kind of a view.

2150
02:01:09,320 --> 02:01:11,860
I mean that's, those are
super, super valuable.

2151
02:01:11,890 --> 02:01:16,120
And in Florida and West Palm Beach,
apparently looking super, super wealthy.

2152
02:01:16,970 --> 02:01:18,640
Yeah. There's $35 million.

2153
02:01:18,641 --> 02:01:23,641
I mean a 3 million amazing
Italian renaissance style
mega mansion in Palm Beach,

2154
02:01:24,941 --> 02:01:28,390
Florida. If you buy
that, you're king cock.

2155
02:01:29,350 --> 02:01:32,880
You're just swinging dick all
over. Come on in. By the way,

2156
02:01:32,920 --> 02:01:35,620
why did God make the deal
like the Dick size? Why? Why?

2157
02:01:35,621 --> 02:01:37,990
Why is that make you work harder? Really?

2158
02:01:38,020 --> 02:01:40,610
That's really the reason that if
you just, if you had a giant hog,

2159
02:01:40,611 --> 02:01:42,960
you'd be just waiting around waiting for
girls to come to you and saying, well,

2160
02:01:42,980 --> 02:01:45,530
he could have made Dick's all the same
size and then there'd be no competition.

2161
02:01:45,560 --> 02:01:49,820
No, no, no. Can't make years the
same size either. Sorry, not noses.

2162
02:01:49,850 --> 02:01:54,290
Not eyebrows. No formity no eugenics.
Yeah, you got to work harder.

2163
02:01:54,320 --> 02:01:58,350
You got a little Dick to figure out
how to get by in this world like a,

2164
02:01:58,520 --> 02:02:00,800
you're God's brain and
those big Dick dudes, man,

2165
02:02:00,801 --> 02:02:03,920
they just don't have the motivation
to hardly ever get anything done.

2166
02:02:04,580 --> 02:02:08,930
It just to, to busy slinging Dick,
that's you skirt around them.

2167
02:02:08,931 --> 02:02:12,920
You pass them in the game. Um,
take them on the inside turn.

2168
02:02:13,460 --> 02:02:16,850
I didn't know that. That's what it is,
right? Like I said, I believe in God.

2169
02:02:16,851 --> 02:02:21,620
Again, it doesn't make sense that there
are sloths. Okay? Why is that fair?

2170
02:02:23,120 --> 02:02:26,630
Why is there lies if they fucking hate it?

2171
02:02:27,470 --> 02:02:31,850
They fucking hate jack by
eagles. You know it is.

2172
02:02:32,060 --> 02:02:35,360
When the main thing that eats
use a bird and you're a mammal,

2173
02:02:35,900 --> 02:02:37,760
how often does that happen
if you're not a mouse?

2174
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:40,520
It's not a field mouse in an owl.
That's hilarious. By the way.

2175
02:02:40,521 --> 02:02:41,680
I didn't know you that they a,

2176
02:02:41,700 --> 02:02:44,210
they already talked shit about
Sloss in the animal kingdom, Bro.

2177
02:02:44,270 --> 02:02:48,620
They all talk shit on slots. Slots moves
slow so slow that mold grows on them.

2178
02:02:49,070 --> 02:02:52,000
I've seen it's gross. It's
crazy. Is it really there?

2179
02:02:52,150 --> 02:02:54,830
That's how lazy they are and
they just can't be any better.

2180
02:02:54,980 --> 02:02:58,760
They just move real slow. That's just
what they do. And mold grows on them.

2181
02:02:59,360 --> 02:03:03,680
That's gross. Yeah. I was at a wildlife
sanctuary and like Sylmar I think it is.

2182
02:03:04,280 --> 02:03:07,790
Take my kids there and they've got a
slap on my God. So cute. And I'm like,

2183
02:03:07,791 --> 02:03:12,110
why is this thing moldy? And they're
like, oh, it grows. Like moss grows on it.

2184
02:03:12,140 --> 02:03:16,550
Like green fungus, like a
tree. Like, look at that.

2185
02:03:16,790 --> 02:03:19,790
Look at all that shit. Oh my God.

2186
02:03:19,970 --> 02:03:24,320
Moss growing on them because they're so
god damn slow that plants can grow on

2187
02:03:24,321 --> 02:03:27,200
them. I mean, is that healthy? I mean
it looks great by the way. This works.

2188
02:03:27,650 --> 02:03:32,390
It's almost like camouflage, but a that
one of the main things that eat them,

2189
02:03:32,710 --> 02:03:37,370
uh, in his it mouth is, uh,
this eagle called um, fuck,

2190
02:03:37,371 --> 02:03:40,340
what is it called? The
Harpy Eagle thing. Yeah.

2191
02:03:40,400 --> 02:03:44,350
It's a giant eagle that lives in South
America that just fucks up slots each

2192
02:03:44,360 --> 02:03:48,380
slot. Man, sloths, me and monkeys too.
It eats monkeys too. But look at that.

2193
02:03:48,410 --> 02:03:50,990
Carrying a sloth to him. I
mean, well yeah, that's a,

2194
02:03:51,050 --> 02:03:54,300
that's not the big slough though. No,
but it's a big fuck. It's the barrier.

2195
02:03:55,190 --> 02:03:59,780
Yeah. I mean look at those thighs.
Yeah Dude. That thing is all power.

2196
02:04:00,230 --> 02:04:03,580
All the power. And that's the, I
think that's the biggest eagle. Yeah,

2197
02:04:03,840 --> 02:04:07,400
the heartbeat. I think that's
the biggest eagle. I mean, damn,

2198
02:04:08,150 --> 02:04:10,310
that's majestic. I mean
those are small slots.

2199
02:04:10,311 --> 02:04:15,260
These like baby sloths that eats like
full grown sloths, loss, slow, slow,

2200
02:04:15,360 --> 02:04:19,690
anybody, whatever. I mean the staff
can't really defend itself. Oh my God.

2201
02:04:19,880 --> 02:04:24,500
He army pushing the armadillos
body. How crazy is that?

2202
02:04:25,040 --> 02:04:28,880
How crazy is how he can crush the Armidale
his body with its claws. That's one.

2203
02:04:29,170 --> 02:04:33,910
It's got it with one hand. It's
one handing that thing. An arm.

2204
02:04:33,920 --> 02:04:37,680
A human arm. Oh right, right
up. Tear your meat apart.

2205
02:04:37,681 --> 02:04:42,030
We're so doughy man. Yeah.
We're so likable. So mushy.

2206
02:04:42,570 --> 02:04:46,080
It would just tear your arm apart.
Just climbing onto your arm. Like,

2207
02:04:46,200 --> 02:04:50,490
that's why those dudes wear those crazy
arm sleeves when they have a falcon on

2208
02:04:50,491 --> 02:04:51,620
their own because it was just

2209
02:04:53,310 --> 02:04:56,160
cause they were really
easy to slice up. Yeah.

2210
02:04:56,820 --> 02:04:59,640
We have no armor fucking
thing with a rabbit. Whoo.

2211
02:04:59,641 --> 02:05:04,620
Look at his legs and things. Bad Ass.
It is a beast that doesn't look real.

2212
02:05:04,650 --> 02:05:08,760
That one's got a little band on its leg.
It's been captured. So there either.

2213
02:05:10,290 --> 02:05:13,330
Is that a carving? No,
that's real. So they,

2214
02:05:13,440 --> 02:05:17,940
they leave the oh they leave the the
rabbit there and it swoops in and get the

2215
02:05:17,941 --> 02:05:20,670
rabbit. It's hard to see what the fuck
it is. Cause all those watermarks.

2216
02:05:20,700 --> 02:05:24,660
So obnoxious with the
watermarks shit. I get it Bro.

2217
02:05:24,720 --> 02:05:27,570
What is that thing right there? Is
that a fox is about to eat right here.

2218
02:05:29,420 --> 02:05:32,210
Oh yeah it is. Yeah. They eat foxes. Damn.

2219
02:05:32,750 --> 02:05:37,750
[inaudible] fighting the foxes fighting
with the eagle over a rabbit there.

2220
02:05:38,170 --> 02:05:42,590
They're fighting over flux
fighting over a Fox. The yeah,

2221
02:05:42,600 --> 02:05:45,450
the Eagle stealing. Yeah.
Just eat the, eat the fucks.

2222
02:05:46,260 --> 02:05:49,470
Eagle Glam grabbed slough from tree.
Oh is that a true oh is that the slaw?

2223
02:05:49,550 --> 02:05:50,490
I'm going to see a video of it.

2224
02:05:50,590 --> 02:05:55,390
You see a video of the slaw cause
it is kind of fucked up deer bucks.

2225
02:05:58,200 --> 02:06:00,120
One thing they do do though is they pull,

2226
02:06:00,180 --> 02:06:03,060
they do do you do have to
say do and then do again,

2227
02:06:03,540 --> 02:06:08,540
one thing they do as well is they grab
goats and fling them off the side of

2228
02:06:08,641 --> 02:06:12,180
cliffs. You ever see that? No,
but that's hilarious. They do.

2229
02:06:12,181 --> 02:06:15,240
They just flick them off. They grab
it looks more real, but I don't know.

2230
02:06:15,460 --> 02:06:17,550
What do they do? That's real,
bro. That's probably real.

2231
02:06:18,240 --> 02:06:20,970
But there's video of it. They do it to
kill them so they can eat them. Okay.

2232
02:06:20,971 --> 02:06:22,950
I was gonna say, yeah,
that makes perfect sense.

2233
02:06:22,951 --> 02:06:25,770
I was wondering why they're
doing it. They're just assholes.

2234
02:06:26,760 --> 02:06:31,380
Just kicking them off though.
That'll be hilarious and perfect.

2235
02:06:31,381 --> 02:06:32,460
Well that's what cats do.

2236
02:06:32,520 --> 02:06:36,630
You know housecats ever seen the numbers
of how many animals house cats kill per

2237
02:06:36,631 --> 02:06:39,720
year? You're kidding. It's in
the billions. You're kidding.

2238
02:06:39,720 --> 02:06:44,430
B B billion B heads kill other animals
by way. Watch this. Watch this. Yeah,

2239
02:06:44,431 --> 02:06:46,980
we'll, we'll, we'll show that right
after. Uh, we'll have to see. Look,

2240
02:06:46,981 --> 02:06:48,690
he's dragging. Oh,

2241
02:06:48,720 --> 02:06:52,800
the goat off the cliff and then drops
it to have it smashed against the rocks.

2242
02:06:52,801 --> 02:06:55,810
Look at that. Look at that. That is dough.

2243
02:06:56,820 --> 02:07:00,330
And then it hits the ground and then the
ego swoops down and starts heating it.

2244
02:07:00,450 --> 02:07:03,510
So it's like planning on
throwing this thing off.

2245
02:07:03,511 --> 02:07:07,920
It understands the consequences. It
understands that that thing can't fly.

2246
02:07:08,610 --> 02:07:12,090
So it's not just grabbing it swooping
down and grabbing it and it broke its

2247
02:07:12,091 --> 02:07:14,460
neck. It's throwing it into the rock,

2248
02:07:14,850 --> 02:07:19,760
throwing it off the cliff so he can eat
it. And that's brilliant. Fucking crazy.

2249
02:07:19,890 --> 02:07:22,380
That's brilliant. What was the other
thing we were just talking about? I said,

2250
02:07:22,590 --> 02:07:26,670
oh, the bird. Oh, well the numbers. Okay.

2251
02:07:26,880 --> 02:07:30,930
The sheer numbers of birds
that house cats kill.

2252
02:07:31,140 --> 02:07:35,950
Just house cats. Just meow out
in the backyard. No, just murder.

2253
02:07:36,340 --> 02:07:40,450
Oh, the murder. Murder. Death.
Just jump up and grab birds.

2254
02:07:40,780 --> 02:07:42,340
I had this cat, her name was spazz.

2255
02:07:42,760 --> 02:07:46,120
She was a fluff ball cat and
she would bring me these birds.

2256
02:07:46,870 --> 02:07:48,670
1.4 billion tons,

2257
02:07:48,920 --> 02:07:53,320
many 3.7 billion birds in
the continental US each year.

2258
02:07:54,890 --> 02:07:59,890
Cats kill from 1.4 billion to
as many as 3.7 billion birds.

2259
02:08:01,420 --> 02:08:06,100
Just birds. That's not mice. That's
not squirrels. Just birds. Just birds.

2260
02:08:06,580 --> 02:08:10,660
I had a cat when I was growing up and
he killed a squirrel and was a walking

2261
02:08:10,661 --> 02:08:12,550
across the street with it in his mouth.

2262
02:08:13,420 --> 02:08:17,770
It was one of the weirdest things I've
ever seen the eat or just like just carry

2263
02:08:17,771 --> 02:08:20,350
it in his mouth. He just, his
name, we knit. We called him kitty.

2264
02:08:20,650 --> 02:08:22,420
We were very unoriginal, were kids.

2265
02:08:23,650 --> 02:08:27,940
I had a name for him that was like the
Black Panther in a Conan the barbarian

2266
02:08:27,941 --> 02:08:31,140
book, but everybody fucking
hated me. The veto on it.

2267
02:08:31,450 --> 02:08:33,130
They never called them and
they just called them kitty.

2268
02:08:33,400 --> 02:08:35,680
So we eventually just wound up
calling him kitty. But Anyway,

2269
02:08:35,681 --> 02:08:39,880
kid herself park walking across the street
with a squirrel in between his legs.

2270
02:08:40,030 --> 02:08:42,970
So he had the squirrel by
the mouth, by its neck,

2271
02:08:42,971 --> 02:08:46,390
rather in his mouth and he was walking
with a squirrel underneath them,

2272
02:08:46,391 --> 02:08:50,290
just dragging it with it in between his
legs and it was almost as big as him.

2273
02:08:50,710 --> 02:08:54,610
That's nuts. I'm looking at this. I'm
like, what a creepy little thing with,

2274
02:08:54,640 --> 02:08:57,300
because a squirrels, they're like
plagued. Don't they know? Yeah.

2275
02:08:57,330 --> 02:09:01,570
I think it like they, that
squirrel plague. Squirrel
plague black plague. Right.

2276
02:09:01,780 --> 02:09:05,020
Wait a minute. No squirrels.
This was like this.

2277
02:09:05,021 --> 02:09:07,390
This was like last decade right there.
Even like maybe even this decade.

2278
02:09:07,391 --> 02:09:10,810
It's a squirrel plague. Yeah. There's
like a black plague for squirrels. Really?

2279
02:09:10,870 --> 02:09:15,820
Yeah, Dude. Well, I know
there was a, um, a co couple,

2280
02:09:15,821 --> 02:09:19,390
I think it was a man and a
woman. Right? Here we go. Whoa.

2281
02:09:20,050 --> 02:09:23,830
Plague infested squirrel
caused the closure of a
California campground this week

2282
02:09:23,831 --> 02:09:26,980
after it was found during your routine
trapping Los Angeles County health

2283
02:09:26,981 --> 02:09:28,060
officials confirmed.

2284
02:09:29,020 --> 02:09:33,100
Actually don't ever touch dead squirrels
who play [inaudible] play. Holy Shit.

2285
02:09:33,130 --> 02:09:36,760
I think there was a, I think that's
what those people got that ate that.

2286
02:09:36,761 --> 02:09:38,380
Marmot liver. Ugh.

2287
02:09:38,650 --> 02:09:42,970
There was some people that got sick and
died from the plague really recently,

2288
02:09:43,090 --> 02:09:48,090
like within the last couple of months
because they had eaten a raw marmot liver.

2289
02:09:48,850 --> 02:09:53,230
A marmot is like some kind of a rodent
and they had killed this Marmet and ate

2290
02:09:53,470 --> 02:09:55,860
his liver and this is
here in the states. Fuck.

2291
02:09:57,400 --> 02:10:01,130
It wasn't Mongolia. I thought
it was an America Mongolian,

2292
02:10:01,540 --> 02:10:05,770
it's Mongolian couple died. Right. But
they didn't die doing it in America.

2293
02:10:06,340 --> 02:10:10,960
Thank God to make sure that they
didn't come here and get it.

2294
02:10:10,961 --> 02:10:12,980
But it says, I thought it,

2295
02:10:13,000 --> 02:10:16,690
I thought the story was they died over
here and like they'd come over here and

2296
02:10:16,691 --> 02:10:21,420
try to re-enact some sort of
a, um, a ritualistic meal.

2297
02:10:22,350 --> 02:10:22,660
Ugh.

2298
02:10:22,660 --> 02:10:26,770
Where they eat this raw liver and they
ate this raw liver and got the plague

2299
02:10:26,771 --> 02:10:31,660
son. Does it say where it happened?

2300
02:10:33,410 --> 02:10:37,310
Okay. Um, yeah, it's like certain
countries in Africa too. There's like a,

2301
02:10:37,760 --> 02:10:40,580
you can like eat human right?
Like, like Cannibal, like, uh,

2302
02:10:41,480 --> 02:10:43,340
legally [inaudible] I
don't know if it's legal.

2303
02:10:43,341 --> 02:10:45,590
I know there was like a story I read
on it or something like that about, uh,

2304
02:10:46,190 --> 02:10:49,790
these like places in like Africa you can
like eat him with this ultimate stone

2305
02:10:50,090 --> 02:10:54,350
or talk. It really is, sorry about that
place, Bro. I know I read about it,

2306
02:10:54,351 --> 02:10:56,030
I'd be read. Well, do you remember the,

2307
02:10:56,031 --> 02:10:59,240
I don't know if you ever saw
this vice piece on Liberia.

2308
02:10:59,690 --> 02:11:01,370
I think that might've been it then. Yeah.

2309
02:11:01,430 --> 02:11:06,320
Vice Guide to travel and Liberia where
they were saying this guy who was his

2310
02:11:06,321 --> 02:11:11,270
name was general button naked
and a general button naked.

2311
02:11:11,970 --> 02:11:14,960
He had become a preacher later in
life, but when he was young preacher,

2312
02:11:15,130 --> 02:11:16,390
but naked. Yeah. When he was young,

2313
02:11:16,640 --> 02:11:20,450
he would go to war totally naked
and he would shoot people. Oh,

2314
02:11:20,451 --> 02:11:24,920
that was a beast of no nation was it?
Yeah. You see beast of no nation now. OK.

2315
02:11:25,400 --> 02:11:29,360
Uh, he just Elba. He plays
like a Idi Amin or a, um, uh,

2316
02:11:29,570 --> 02:11:32,750
what's that thing called? Coney, whatever
it was. Anyway, he's got these trials,

2317
02:11:32,751 --> 02:11:34,790
soldiers basically, and uh, yeah,

2318
02:11:34,791 --> 02:11:36,440
they just go from my tribe to tribe
and just kill it. They're like,

2319
02:11:36,441 --> 02:11:39,470
and they just genocide. Just go
bless your tribe. How about them?

2320
02:11:39,471 --> 02:11:42,350
Whatever happened with
that, Coney remember that?

2321
02:11:42,380 --> 02:11:43,910
I think he still let go like a warlord.

2322
02:11:43,911 --> 02:11:48,290
But you remember how it was like this
gigantic movement and it was this big

2323
02:11:48,291 --> 02:11:49,610
thing and everybody was talking about it.

2324
02:11:49,611 --> 02:11:52,760
And then this one guy in San Diego
that was a part of starting it,

2325
02:11:53,120 --> 02:11:56,180
he wound up being naked,
wandering around the street,

2326
02:11:56,181 --> 02:11:59,050
masturbating in front of people and
some crazy shit that made him like that.

2327
02:11:59,230 --> 02:12:02,090
Not Credible. Then I make that up. He
was doing something along those lines,

2328
02:12:02,091 --> 02:12:06,670
right. He basically had a schizophrenia
break or a psychotic break.

2329
02:12:06,950 --> 02:12:10,550
I'm not a doctor. Something went
wrong. Something went wrong, dad.

2330
02:12:10,600 --> 02:12:13,820
I blew a flick. That's the cat. Yeah,
they called them tripod in that.

2331
02:12:13,850 --> 02:12:16,010
But I think you're talking about the
same guy. Like when he went to war,

2332
02:12:16,040 --> 02:12:17,870
like as a child soldier.
Yeah, he was butt naked.

2333
02:12:17,970 --> 02:12:19,400
The thing is a different
guy because this guy,

2334
02:12:19,401 --> 02:12:21,320
his name literally was
general button naked,

2335
02:12:21,321 --> 02:12:23,690
but I think there's a bunch of
them that did that. But anyway,

2336
02:12:24,230 --> 02:12:25,490
on the Liberia show,

2337
02:12:25,491 --> 02:12:30,350
he said that he busted these street cart
guys selling human meat and he said he

2338
02:12:30,351 --> 02:12:33,950
knew because he knew what meat tastes
like cause he had eaten it. What the fuck?

2339
02:12:34,040 --> 02:12:37,790
He knew that it was human meat. He knew
it wasn't pork. He knew it wasn't beef.

2340
02:12:37,850 --> 02:12:41,580
Liberia is crazy by the way.
I mean like are they sell? No,

2341
02:12:41,630 --> 02:12:46,630
they have slaves out there for some
imagine the gall of going to the cops and

2342
02:12:46,791 --> 02:12:50,420
saying that man is selling human meat.
Well how do you know that kind of walk?

2343
02:12:50,600 --> 02:12:54,560
Cause I've eaten it. I mean fuck,
fuck. What'd you eat? Human,

2344
02:12:57,020 --> 02:13:00,590
um, I depends on what you have to
do to stay alive. Right, right.

2345
02:13:00,680 --> 02:13:02,560
Like where are you? What's app?

2346
02:13:02,570 --> 02:13:05,310
Like if you were in that movie alive
when they're scooping the [inaudible]

2347
02:13:05,610 --> 02:13:08,510
saying that with broken spoon
Donner pass or something like that.

2348
02:13:08,930 --> 02:13:11,450
What are you going to do? But then
the, I'm saying like as a Foodie, like,

2349
02:13:11,451 --> 02:13:14,000
you know, you go to like a restaurant
food. That's what I'm saying.

2350
02:13:14,300 --> 02:13:18,470
Like if they cook it up nice. You know
what I mean? You get some Tabasco,

2351
02:13:18,530 --> 02:13:23,360
you found eating to dude's foot. Ugh,
you've got foot soup or dick soup.

2352
02:13:24,000 --> 02:13:27,380
A Dick Burger. Well there was
one guy. Okay. There was another,

2353
02:13:27,381 --> 02:13:28,550
there was one guy story,

2354
02:13:28,930 --> 02:13:33,870
but there was one guy that I had read
about where online he requested that

2355
02:13:33,871 --> 02:13:37,800
someone kill him and eat him.
Damn, that's his death wish. Yeah.

2356
02:13:37,890 --> 02:13:41,370
And I think it was in Germany.
Of course they met together,

2357
02:13:41,420 --> 02:13:42,420
got together with a guy.

2358
02:13:42,780 --> 02:13:47,700
The guy cut his dick off and they
cooked it and uh, they ate it together.

2359
02:13:47,701 --> 02:13:52,260
He ate part of his deck and then
the guy wound up killing him and um,

2360
02:13:52,470 --> 02:13:55,290
oh wait, wait. So this guy was alive
and they cooked an aids duck. Oh, he,

2361
02:13:55,370 --> 02:13:57,360
they ate his Dick Together.
They did. They did it together.

2362
02:13:57,420 --> 02:14:00,900
It was so German did, it
was, it was this guy's idea.

2363
02:14:01,320 --> 02:14:05,340
He requested it. Okay. I'm like
craigslist or one of those things.

2364
02:14:05,580 --> 02:14:08,660
Let's cut my dick off and then an evening
we're going to eat it and then you're

2365
02:14:08,780 --> 02:14:12,390
gonna kill me. And again, he wanted
to, he wanted the guy to eat him too.

2366
02:14:12,391 --> 02:14:14,100
And again, I think the
guy did eat some of them,

2367
02:14:14,730 --> 02:14:18,600
but there was a question as to whether
or not a person is a lot to eat.

2368
02:14:18,810 --> 02:14:22,740
How do you, how do you prosecute that?
What do you do? Like if someone said,

2369
02:14:22,741 --> 02:14:25,230
I want you to cut my dick off and you
cut their dick off, I want to cook it,

2370
02:14:25,231 --> 02:14:28,050
need it, and then you both cook it. Need
it. I want you to kill me and eat me.

2371
02:14:28,051 --> 02:14:32,560
Okay. And they got kills them and
eats them like, well, what is that?

2372
02:14:33,400 --> 02:14:35,730
It's not a regular murder.

2373
02:14:35,731 --> 02:14:39,120
I think I'm reading the same stories
that manslaughter filmed it. Oh,

2374
02:14:39,121 --> 02:14:40,830
they filmed it? Yeah. Yeah.

2375
02:14:40,831 --> 02:14:44,010
They filmed it of like him cutting
his dick off in the eating it. Yeah.

2376
02:14:44,011 --> 02:14:46,500
I think they filmed the whole
murder. What's the threshold? Oh,

2377
02:14:46,501 --> 02:14:50,520
so it's like a snuff film. Yeah.
Yeah. But the guy requested it.

2378
02:14:51,650 --> 02:14:54,450
Yeah. Pull it up so we
can, uh, we can read it.

2379
02:14:55,960 --> 02:15:00,660
This one from 2003. Yeah,
that's a, that's the one. Yeah.

2380
02:15:01,470 --> 02:15:05,450
Yup. 45. [inaudible] you've
done from my live body.

2381
02:15:05,710 --> 02:15:06,570
Wow.

2382
02:15:06,690 --> 02:15:10,230
See? Yeah. He posted a personal
ad saying, seeking well-built man,

2383
02:15:10,560 --> 02:15:14,820
18 to 30 years old for slaughter. Whoa.

2384
02:15:14,840 --> 02:15:16,290
For slaughter. He wrote,

2385
02:15:16,291 --> 02:15:21,180
I offer myself to you and we'll
let you dine from my live body,

2386
02:15:21,300 --> 02:15:23,310
not butchery, dining,

2387
02:15:23,490 --> 02:15:26,490
whoever really all caps wants to do it.

2388
02:15:26,790 --> 02:15:31,380
We'll need a real all caps victim,
all caps, exclamation point.

2389
02:15:31,830 --> 02:15:32,191
There's two.

2390
02:15:32,191 --> 02:15:37,191
Started swapping increasingly explicit
emails and on March nine 2001 Braden took

2391
02:15:38,191 --> 02:15:42,180
a day off work, never to return.
He sold everything he owned,

2392
02:15:42,240 --> 02:15:44,130
including his treasured sports car,

2393
02:15:44,670 --> 02:15:49,230
wiped his computer hard drive and
bought a one way ticket to castle near

2394
02:15:49,900 --> 02:15:52,890
Frankfurt and met him off the train.

2395
02:15:53,220 --> 02:15:58,020
They bought painkillers at a chemical
shop while headed back to the house at

2396
02:15:58,021 --> 02:16:01,020
first brand has got cold feet
and one to return to Berlin.

2397
02:16:02,580 --> 02:16:03,060
Muse said,

2398
02:16:03,060 --> 02:16:08,060
but he reconsidered swallowed painkillers
and medication to make him sleepy.

2399
02:16:08,730 --> 02:16:11,690
He said, now do it. Muse.

2400
02:16:11,910 --> 02:16:15,870
Sit the video camera rolling and went
to work with a kitchen knife. Wow, dude.

2401
02:16:15,990 --> 02:16:19,950
We went into the bedroom. How
do you say values the bathroom.

2402
02:16:20,070 --> 02:16:22,260
How do you say his name's Muse? Emmy Muse.

2403
02:16:22,730 --> 02:16:27,730
Muse told the police brain is lay in the
bath so the blood could flow away and

2404
02:16:29,110 --> 02:16:31,060
is slowly began to lose consciousness.

2405
02:16:31,780 --> 02:16:36,780
Muse passed the time reading a star trek
novel when the Berliner finally passed

2406
02:16:36,941 --> 02:16:40,960
out, muse cut his throat. Now
this is zoomed over a number.

2407
02:16:41,000 --> 02:16:43,540
He was consumed over a number of months,

2408
02:16:44,020 --> 02:16:47,410
the 30 kilos of flesh he
had put in his freezer. Wow.

2409
02:16:47,910 --> 02:16:50,920
Hughes went on the Internet
in search of a new victim. Oh.

2410
02:16:50,921 --> 02:16:54,340
So he became like a tasted frustrated
that he could only find people looking for

2411
02:16:54,341 --> 02:16:55,174
cannibal.

2412
02:16:55,440 --> 02:16:59,470
Roleplays muse began boasting about
Brandis someone from the chat room and

2413
02:16:59,700 --> 02:17:04,480
formed the federal police who swooped
in arm and Muse House in December 10th

2414
02:17:04,481 --> 02:17:08,980
last surprising the Koi Cannibal, then
startling the unsuspecting neighbors.

2415
02:17:10,790 --> 02:17:14,900
Whew. Wow. No, that's that. A sociopath
psychopath. And you were saying earlier,

2416
02:17:15,130 --> 02:17:17,750
yeah cause are you a psychopath
or you're a sociopath that point,

2417
02:17:18,920 --> 02:17:21,350
I mean how do you not feel empathy even
for a guy who's telling you to kill you,

2418
02:17:21,351 --> 02:17:22,370
but you're just looking, you know,

2419
02:17:22,371 --> 02:17:25,550
to kill somebody cause you have a taste
for blood now it became a blood thing,

2420
02:17:25,551 --> 02:17:30,350
right? Yeah. I bet whatever he
did during the day was boring.

2421
02:17:31,310 --> 02:17:35,000
And I bet that as psychotic
as it is was exciting.

2422
02:17:35,570 --> 02:17:40,400
And then he became a serial killer
chasing that. That feeling? Yeah.

2423
02:17:40,820 --> 02:17:44,930
What is it Jamie? What's
the matter? He's got it.

2424
02:17:46,050 --> 02:17:46,480
I,

2425
02:17:46,480 --> 02:17:49,770
I found a website that had
seven or something interesting
facts about this guy.

2426
02:17:49,771 --> 02:17:50,610
This is the first one

2427
02:17:50,880 --> 02:17:54,100
he sauteed and ate the peanuts
with his victim. Yeah, that was,

2428
02:17:54,210 --> 02:17:57,660
that was the story, right? Yeah.
Yeah. They, they cooked it together.

2429
02:17:58,020 --> 02:18:00,900
Sauteed it. Wow. Look at that image.

2430
02:18:01,170 --> 02:18:04,680
That's not really how it went down or
something. Yeah, that's enough though.

2431
02:18:04,920 --> 02:18:07,380
Does it say it? Like what?
How they sauteed the penis

2432
02:18:08,500 --> 02:18:10,870
too chewy for them.
Either of them to enjoy.

2433
02:18:11,200 --> 02:18:15,100
So they proceeded to fry it up with
some of his flesh and fat and a bit of

2434
02:18:15,101 --> 02:18:15,934
garlic.

2435
02:18:16,000 --> 02:18:19,070
Oh, that's hard. I mean that's not,

2436
02:18:20,120 --> 02:18:23,840
I guess it's like you're worried about
the end, right. And then you just say,

2437
02:18:23,870 --> 02:18:27,140
I'm going to take control. I'm going
to bring the end on and here it is.

2438
02:18:27,330 --> 02:18:30,680
You got where you were eating my
dick. This is over. This is not,

2439
02:18:30,890 --> 02:18:35,420
we're eating my tick. This is
not going to last. Eat My dick.

2440
02:18:35,480 --> 02:18:40,480
And then he goes into the tub to die
out from warm water with this dick hole

2441
02:18:40,880 --> 02:18:44,990
bleeding out. Just really insane
stuff. I mean, that's really it.

2442
02:18:45,020 --> 02:18:46,590
I mean to live through
that, by the way. Well,

2443
02:18:46,700 --> 02:18:51,700
you got to think that there's just such
a wide range of crazy people and there's

2444
02:18:53,901 --> 02:18:57,080
some crazy people like that that want to
be eaten and some crazy people want to

2445
02:18:57,081 --> 02:19:00,470
eat you. And if they find
each other though, that's,

2446
02:19:00,530 --> 02:19:02,120
that's the beauty of the
Internet. You can do that now.

2447
02:19:02,121 --> 02:19:05,810
You couldn't do that back in, you
know, the Donner era or even the, uh,

2448
02:19:05,900 --> 02:19:08,210
the 90s with Brazilian soccer
team at each other. Oh,

2449
02:19:08,360 --> 02:19:09,680
how long do you think that guy could,

2450
02:19:09,990 --> 02:19:14,120
could've kept it together if he just
ate that one dude before he could find

2451
02:19:14,121 --> 02:19:17,510
another guy that will let him eat
him. And if that was his thing,

2452
02:19:17,680 --> 02:19:20,240
what'd he just [inaudible] himself?
Right, exactly. What do you go?

2453
02:19:20,480 --> 02:19:23,870
What do you go Dexter and just go,
that's what I'm saying. Like bad people.

2454
02:19:23,871 --> 02:19:27,110
Yeah. Oh, that show was fucking,

2455
02:19:28,460 --> 02:19:31,060
I mean the, I mean just to, just
to go there and kill the guy.

2456
02:19:31,380 --> 02:19:32,960
Read his star trek novel. By the way.

2457
02:19:32,990 --> 02:19:36,380
Why the guy's bleeding out in
a tub after you ate his dick.

2458
02:19:36,570 --> 02:19:37,550
That's some psychopath shit.

2459
02:19:38,990 --> 02:19:41,840
Picking Dick out of your teeth and not
that I'm not sharing with you guys.

2460
02:19:41,980 --> 02:19:45,110
There are pictures of this online.
Oh No, no, don't do this. Yeah,

2461
02:19:46,170 --> 02:19:50,040
I don't need this. What I don't want
to see. Yeah, so dick is to chew.

2462
02:19:50,170 --> 02:19:52,700
You're going to say, I was like, don't
do this. Whatever you're going to do.

2463
02:19:52,701 --> 02:19:56,870
Don't do this. Said jurors have seek
therapy after they watched the video.

2464
02:19:57,020 --> 02:20:01,230
Oh yeah, I bet. Did see
PTSD. Of course they did.

2465
02:20:01,310 --> 02:20:03,780
And imagine being a juror and they
force you to watch that video. Yeah,

2466
02:20:03,880 --> 02:20:04,940
I don't want to see anybody yet.

2467
02:20:05,060 --> 02:20:07,640
I don't want to see you eat a dick and
you're the only ones watching it, right?

2468
02:20:07,641 --> 02:20:08,630
Because you've got to think that.

2469
02:20:09,020 --> 02:20:11,870
It's not like they're broadcasting on
television. Let me on fear of heck,

2470
02:20:11,871 --> 02:20:12,640
you guys did it like a,

2471
02:20:12,640 --> 02:20:14,900
like it was always like the big thing
of like eating somebody's penis,

2472
02:20:14,930 --> 02:20:18,980
right or something. Yeah.

2473
02:20:19,390 --> 02:20:22,280
No bull Titus one time they
had eat dicks, right? Yeah,

2474
02:20:22,281 --> 02:20:26,180
they had to eat like Bull Dick, dear
Dick, pig dick, something like that.

2475
02:20:26,210 --> 02:20:27,100
I forget what the decor,

2476
02:20:27,190 --> 02:20:29,810
but it was a bunch of different
kinds of dicks and they'll even,

2477
02:20:29,910 --> 02:20:32,270
they'll be like, it's
just something so strange.

2478
02:20:32,960 --> 02:20:36,470
I had a bit about it that like never
in my life that I think that I'd be

2479
02:20:36,471 --> 02:20:40,100
standing in front of a girl with a
plate full of animal dicks going,

2480
02:20:40,101 --> 02:20:43,800
you can do it. Hang in there, keep,

2481
02:20:44,450 --> 02:20:48,860
keep going, keep going. Use
Your just you control your mind.

2482
02:20:48,861 --> 02:20:52,940
Control your mind. Coaching them
through it. Nice. Through eating. Yeah.

2483
02:20:53,060 --> 02:20:55,700
Eating pig paint, pig,
penis. Ridiculous Dick.

2484
02:20:56,210 --> 02:21:00,910
But it's like you can't,
I look at things Jamie,

2485
02:21:00,950 --> 02:21:03,230
it's not legal to kill
yourself. It's illegal.

2486
02:21:04,490 --> 02:21:07,730
Suicide's illegal and it's
not legal to eat people.

2487
02:21:08,600 --> 02:21:11,960
And even if someone tells you to kill
them and eat them, you're not allowed to.

2488
02:21:12,680 --> 02:21:15,440
Even in Jeremy, like even like that,
cause that's assisted suicide, right?

2489
02:21:15,470 --> 02:21:19,700
Technically you can't what
it's cannibalism to like
we're, we don't allow that.

2490
02:21:19,760 --> 02:21:23,690
No sleep. Humanities doesn't
allow that. There's some tribes,

2491
02:21:23,691 --> 02:21:27,200
there's a few tribes is still
practice realism that particularly,

2492
02:21:27,740 --> 02:21:28,850
I guess I was reading,

2493
02:21:30,820 --> 02:21:33,950
I'm just not interested in like learning
what like what a human tastes like.

2494
02:21:34,360 --> 02:21:38,720
Well, it's probably not good, right?
Yeah. We eat a little trash cannibalism.

2495
02:21:38,721 --> 02:21:42,260
There's no laws against cannibals and
per se, but in most of not all states,

2496
02:21:42,400 --> 02:21:46,070
there have been enacted laws that
indirectly make it impossible to legally

2497
02:21:46,071 --> 02:21:51,030
obtain and consume the body matter.
That's when you put it that way. Yeah.

2498
02:21:51,080 --> 02:21:53,630
It doesn't sound too appetizer. If
you can get it, the body matter.

2499
02:21:54,170 --> 02:21:58,910
Wait a minute. Wasn't there a
show on CNN or one of their guys?

2500
02:21:59,290 --> 02:22:02,990
They, they wanted him
to eat charred flash.

2501
02:22:03,650 --> 02:22:06,650
Like he was, uh, examining
different religions.

2502
02:22:07,190 --> 02:22:08,690
Do you remember something
along these lines?

2503
02:22:08,691 --> 02:22:12,440
It was like some outrageous thing
like Gupta, Sandra or the, uh, no,

2504
02:22:12,441 --> 02:22:15,740
I don't think it was Sanjay Gupta was
someone else, but there was, they were,

2505
02:22:15,930 --> 02:22:16,763
he,

2506
02:22:16,810 --> 02:22:21,810
he visited all of these
different religions and
people that lived their lives.

2507
02:22:23,920 --> 02:22:26,040
Different, weird ways and
wonderful. I know the show you're

2508
02:22:26,040 --> 02:22:28,110
talking about. Yeah. I
don't remember that episode.

2509
02:22:28,430 --> 02:22:32,010
Can you write it wasn't Gupta. It
was a, a, another correspondent.

2510
02:22:32,790 --> 02:22:36,630
He eventually got fired for CNN
for saying something about Trump,

2511
02:22:38,190 --> 02:22:41,260
which is hilarious. Yeah.

2512
02:22:41,440 --> 02:22:45,780
Cause you're sparks outrage after
eating human brain in new show.

2513
02:22:45,781 --> 02:22:49,320
It takes like charcoal. See
the problem with that too,

2514
02:22:49,350 --> 02:22:52,220
by eating a human brain is that, I mean,

2515
02:22:52,410 --> 02:22:56,550
maybe these cults or these tribes or
whatever he's involved with does do that.

2516
02:22:57,030 --> 02:22:59,670
If the brain has prions,

2517
02:23:00,670 --> 02:23:05,030
prions are what gives you mad
cow disease. Oh really? Yeah.

2518
02:23:05,830 --> 02:23:09,840
Yeah. You can. Yeah. You can get sick
from that and die. Yucks Feld crap.

2519
02:23:09,841 --> 02:23:13,860
What does that name
event? Jake. Chuck Jakub.

2520
02:23:14,340 --> 02:23:17,040
Jakub crux fell disease. And it's, um,

2521
02:23:17,940 --> 02:23:20,310
it's basically mad cow disease
and you get it from prions.

2522
02:23:20,311 --> 02:23:24,990
Get it from brain tissue. So it takes,
they survive like thousands of degrees.

2523
02:23:26,120 --> 02:23:29,070
Yeah. Crux, Feld, Yacob
disease. That's it. Okay.

2524
02:23:29,071 --> 02:23:32,700
So the most rare degenerative fatal brain
disorder and affects about one person.

2525
02:23:32,701 --> 02:23:37,470
So some people get it without
cannibalism. Um, but it also does happen.

2526
02:23:38,040 --> 02:23:40,400
See One person every million worldwide.

2527
02:23:40,450 --> 02:23:44,640
The United States about
350 cases per year. Crazy.

2528
02:23:44,790 --> 02:23:48,930
So it must be like really charred
though. It doesn't matter. I don't think.

2529
02:23:48,990 --> 02:23:52,080
Really. Yeah, I don't think it does.
And he's still, he's still alive. Yeah.

2530
02:23:52,140 --> 02:23:56,790
Well he might not have had the
prions of someone who has a disease,

2531
02:23:57,120 --> 02:23:58,620
but if that person did,

2532
02:23:59,070 --> 02:24:04,070
that's why it it like it has to be the
temperature that it has to be cooked at.

2533
02:24:04,231 --> 02:24:05,220
It's supposed to be insane.

2534
02:24:05,221 --> 02:24:09,990
I think prions can survive like more
than a thousand degrees for a long period

2535
02:24:09,991 --> 02:24:13,950
of time. Okay. That's one of the
fears of like mad cow disease.

2536
02:24:13,951 --> 02:24:17,400
Like you really are not going to be
able to cook it well enough to keep that

2537
02:24:17,401 --> 02:24:22,050
shit from getting in your bloodstream.
Ah, yeah. Fuck. See Google.

2538
02:24:22,051 --> 02:24:26,470
How long Jamie, your Google off the all
off changed today. You got extra groove,

2539
02:24:26,500 --> 02:24:28,170
a lot of flesh talk today. Yeah.

2540
02:24:28,350 --> 02:24:33,350
How well what temperature do
pry on surviving cause uh,

2541
02:24:35,520 --> 02:24:38,490
I think it's more than a thousand
degrees and they can still survive,

2542
02:24:38,850 --> 02:24:43,440
which I remember reading that going,
Oh this is terrible. Mad cow disease.

2543
02:24:43,470 --> 02:24:47,010
Zombies. Zombies. Yeah,
exactly. It depends. I mean,

2544
02:24:47,100 --> 02:24:50,500
I mean you have your food so you're
not worried about that. Yeah,

2545
02:24:50,520 --> 02:24:53,670
but you should be worried because there's
a thing called chronic wasting disease

2546
02:24:54,060 --> 02:24:59,060
and chronic wasting disease is essentially
a form of like mad cow disease,

2547
02:24:59,251 --> 02:25:02,730
like very similar type of degenerative
disease that affects deer,

2548
02:25:02,731 --> 02:25:05,910
that it's affecting an increasing number
of from they're spreading across the

2549
02:25:05,911 --> 02:25:10,560
country now. It hasn't made the
jump to humans yet, but it could.

2550
02:25:11,620 --> 02:25:15,760
I don't want to worry here, but
you can't Deere, no more man.

2551
02:25:15,761 --> 02:25:20,620
Ions cannot be destroyed by
boiling alcohol acid standard
autoclaving methods or

2552
02:25:21,200 --> 02:25:24,130
radio or radiation.
That's what I'm saying.

2553
02:25:24,370 --> 02:25:26,920
They're like roaches. I think
they'll survive everything. Well,

2554
02:25:26,950 --> 02:25:28,710
you know what they are.
They're God's poison.

2555
02:25:29,350 --> 02:25:34,180
When God's like e nef
like no fire, no flames,

2556
02:25:34,181 --> 02:25:39,060
no ice, no water. You ain't fixing
this. This is coming in hot. Yeah.

2557
02:25:39,290 --> 02:25:42,460
And this is the, you can't
go yawns are forever.

2558
02:25:43,240 --> 02:25:48,130
Proteins are in the hard to kill hall
of fame and maybe more common than we

2559
02:25:48,131 --> 02:25:51,550
realize. See, this is what I'm
talking about. So these things,

2560
02:25:51,610 --> 02:25:55,030
this is what affects people
when they get mad cow disease.

2561
02:25:55,720 --> 02:25:57,220
And this is also what it affects.

2562
02:25:57,221 --> 02:26:02,221
Cannibals crux failed Yakup or Jakub
Cooksville the first way crux failed.

2563
02:26:03,930 --> 02:26:07,840
Yucca D. Okay. Crux failed Jakub
disease, but it affects cannibals.

2564
02:26:08,620 --> 02:26:12,070
They found out the cannibals
in New Zealand, New Guinea,

2565
02:26:12,400 --> 02:26:15,830
cannibals in New Guinea, um,
exhibited the same sort of, um,

2566
02:26:16,150 --> 02:26:20,390
symptoms as people with a
cross filled Jakub disease. Uh,

2567
02:26:21,070 --> 02:26:23,620
Google that jamming it
all. Fucking AP cannibals,

2568
02:26:23,800 --> 02:26:26,470
cannibals that get crux
felled Jakub disease,

2569
02:26:26,650 --> 02:26:30,040
those poor cannibals while they're
heating brain matter. That's what it is.

2570
02:26:30,330 --> 02:26:33,250
It just eat. Yeah, just eat the
flesh. Fries the flesh. Eat the booty.

2571
02:26:35,030 --> 02:26:37,360
The bone. Here you go.
Only only pork butts.

2572
02:26:37,990 --> 02:26:42,430
They evolved their resistance to it
because they were getting it so much.

2573
02:26:42,490 --> 02:26:46,080
Oh my God. That's crazy.
Wow. Good for them.

2574
02:26:46,120 --> 02:26:50,110
Cannibalism in one Papau New Guinea
tribe led to the spread of a fatal brain

2575
02:26:50,111 --> 02:26:54,100
disease called Kourou that caused a
devastating epidemic in the group.

2576
02:26:54,130 --> 02:26:58,240
But now some members of the tribe carry
a gene that appears to protect against

2577
02:26:58,241 --> 02:27:03,130
Kourou as well as others, so called
pry on diseases such as mad cow.

2578
02:27:03,370 --> 02:27:07,480
So they have it all. They evolve
that generational. Wow. Like a super,

2579
02:27:07,690 --> 02:27:10,780
like a superbug fucking
life finds a way, man,

2580
02:27:11,230 --> 02:27:16,230
to equalize that way and wonder how long
it's gonna take before we're physically

2581
02:27:16,241 --> 02:27:19,150
addicted to phones to the point
where you needed to stay alive.

2582
02:27:19,930 --> 02:27:24,040
I mean like you need use
warm clothes, right? In a,

2583
02:27:24,041 --> 02:27:26,140
in a cold environment,
you need a warm house.

2584
02:27:26,980 --> 02:27:30,220
How long before you need a
phone? Like, here's the thing,

2585
02:27:31,000 --> 02:27:34,060
the phones gonna help you. It's gonna
make everything better, but you need it.

2586
02:27:34,870 --> 02:27:37,720
So yeah, it's almost like a, like a heart
monitor. Like, I'm going to need this.

2587
02:27:37,750 --> 02:27:40,570
You have to have it. Wow. Ah,

2588
02:27:40,660 --> 02:27:44,530
it's gonna take generations and I can
access point to the Internet instead of a

2589
02:27:44,531 --> 02:27:48,340
phone, a way to access that.
Don't just call it a phone,

2590
02:27:49,030 --> 02:27:52,860
call it an electronics soul. I mean
will the phone is the only what?

2591
02:27:52,950 --> 02:27:56,260
The access to the Matrix, which is the
internet and that thing's not real,

2592
02:27:57,130 --> 02:27:59,830
you know, unless you live
inside of it, it's not real yet.

2593
02:28:00,090 --> 02:28:02,660
That's sounds drawing you in though.
How often you use your phone every day,

2594
02:28:03,220 --> 02:28:07,660
obviously. Yeah, obviously, but
it just gives, yeah. Honestly,

2595
02:28:08,020 --> 02:28:09,850
I'm using on it. I'm
not saying I'm above it,

2596
02:28:09,851 --> 02:28:11,620
I'm just saying and I'm not even sure why.

2597
02:28:12,140 --> 02:28:14,410
Although sometimes I'm searching
Google news just to see if something's

2598
02:28:14,411 --> 02:28:17,050
interesting. Yeah. I'll look at
the same news. What do you got?

2599
02:28:17,051 --> 02:28:21,130
Nothing in politics. Okay. About
entertainment. Nothing. Nothing, nothing.

2600
02:28:21,210 --> 02:28:21,980
How about outside gave me some

2601
02:28:21,980 --> 02:28:25,100
science. Come man, what do you got
rid of me? What do you got for me?

2602
02:28:25,260 --> 02:28:27,650
Just constantly, instead of
thinking about what I'm doing,

2603
02:28:27,980 --> 02:28:32,930
constantly searched for some
new data. It's weird, right?

2604
02:28:33,290 --> 02:28:37,360
It's, I mean it's happening. I like,
I mean, we can get rid of it. No,

2605
02:28:37,650 --> 02:28:39,320
we're talking about these are
the, like this generation of kids,

2606
02:28:39,321 --> 02:28:41,600
like this is the two girls, one cup
generation. You know what I mean?

2607
02:28:41,601 --> 02:28:45,500
Like they get to see it at like five
years old on their phone. Right. That's,

2608
02:28:45,770 --> 02:28:46,603
that's going to change.

2609
02:28:46,620 --> 02:28:48,440
So I think when you're saying
that's going to take generations,

2610
02:28:48,441 --> 02:28:50,870
I mean it could be what a few generations
removed moved from like where they,

2611
02:28:50,871 --> 02:28:53,060
you just, you don't know any
better if you don't have a phone.

2612
02:28:53,880 --> 02:28:54,713
Wow.

2613
02:28:56,000 --> 02:28:57,650
So we'd be at the faces
of death generation.

2614
02:28:57,680 --> 02:29:00,680
Cause like our parents probably never
saw that shit. But we definitely did.

2615
02:29:00,710 --> 02:29:03,860
They saw it in the war son. They saw,
they saw it in person, we saw it on TV.

2616
02:29:03,920 --> 02:29:07,940
You were there man. The first
bitch ass generation. I mean look,

2617
02:29:07,941 --> 02:29:12,941
I mean my generation were definitely the
chasses well when you go back to like

2618
02:29:14,090 --> 02:29:16,610
World War II, everybody was
signing up. Right, right.

2619
02:29:16,810 --> 02:29:19,640
Those people just signed up for the war.

2620
02:29:21,100 --> 02:29:24,040
But then he got around to
Vietnam. I was like, what? Yeah.

2621
02:29:24,130 --> 02:29:25,450
Well while we were there,
the fuck are we doing?

2622
02:29:25,840 --> 02:29:28,260
They manipulated that war though. So
that was different where we're to you,

2623
02:29:28,270 --> 02:29:29,800
like you, you know, Pearl
Harbor happened, you know,

2624
02:29:29,801 --> 02:29:33,580
there's no Pearl Harbor that happened
for Vietnam. Even nine 11 like, you know,

2625
02:29:33,581 --> 02:29:35,040
like the guys were signed
up to go, you know,

2626
02:29:35,090 --> 02:29:36,760
and quote unquote fight
those terrorists. You know,

2627
02:29:37,090 --> 02:29:41,590
this faction of dudes like how
many guys came back from war world,

2628
02:29:41,740 --> 02:29:45,310
World War II with
horrific memories. Right.

2629
02:29:45,720 --> 02:29:47,580
I remember saving private Ryan. Yeah.

2630
02:29:48,190 --> 02:29:52,960
That was one of the best
depictions of a historical event.

2631
02:29:53,170 --> 02:29:55,570
And to put it into like real perspective,

2632
02:29:55,571 --> 02:29:58,750
what it probably was like when those guys
were getting gunned down on the beach.

2633
02:29:58,810 --> 02:30:01,990
Yeah. You thought you yeah. You didn't
know who's going to be you or not. Yeah.

2634
02:30:02,080 --> 02:30:06,100
But it's also whoa, this is real as fuck.

2635
02:30:06,310 --> 02:30:09,790
And then imagine leaving that and coming
back and like you said to be normal.

2636
02:30:10,030 --> 02:30:12,370
Yeah. Cause most movies
that we saw about war,

2637
02:30:12,371 --> 02:30:14,590
like go back to like John
Wayne movies about war,

2638
02:30:15,100 --> 02:30:17,050
they would never gory is like bang,

2639
02:30:19,380 --> 02:30:23,830
they fall down, you know, ah, hold
his stomach. He didn't see anything.

2640
02:30:24,280 --> 02:30:28,570
And then later, even in
movies like apocalypse now,

2641
02:30:29,530 --> 02:30:33,430
I mean it was still wild and still
gave you this feeling of war,

2642
02:30:33,670 --> 02:30:38,500
but there was never anywhere near the
Gore of that scene and saving private

2643
02:30:38,501 --> 02:30:39,200
Ryan.

2644
02:30:39,200 --> 02:30:42,010
Then you see people with their legs
blown off and their guts hanging out and

2645
02:30:42,090 --> 02:30:46,120
you're like, Whoa, Lee, shit,
that's war. That's what a war.

2646
02:30:47,530 --> 02:30:48,720
We never saw that.

2647
02:30:48,970 --> 02:30:53,970
You never see that unless you're there
in the war or unless you're watching a

2648
02:30:54,761 --> 02:30:58,480
movie like that, cause the
movies that whitewash it,

2649
02:30:58,510 --> 02:31:02,080
they give it this feeling
of like, ah, yeah,

2650
02:31:04,060 --> 02:31:04,391
Bang,

2651
02:31:04,391 --> 02:31:09,391
Bang what they're exposed to as far as
their entertainment in the 1940s and then

2652
02:31:10,210 --> 02:31:14,970
boom, you're there and you're seeing
real war. I mean, they'll fucking, dude,

2653
02:31:15,040 --> 02:31:17,110
they'll scare you straight. Like why
would you want to go fight in that?

2654
02:31:17,620 --> 02:31:19,740
They were scared of the
Germans taking the world.

2655
02:31:19,741 --> 02:31:23,190
They see the world from the
Nazis. That's one of those rare,

2656
02:31:23,270 --> 02:31:25,410
it's a great way to put it,
save the world from the Nazis,

2657
02:31:25,440 --> 02:31:29,190
rare wars where it's not
that it's not that sloppy.

2658
02:31:29,220 --> 02:31:33,190
It's pretty clear. You got to realize,
guys are, yeah, they're evil, right?

2659
02:31:33,191 --> 02:31:37,260
Right, right. Fire. You have a legitimate
evil empire that's killing people.

2660
02:31:37,380 --> 02:31:41,670
They killed 6 million Jews
or whatever the number is.

2661
02:31:42,420 --> 02:31:43,910
What is the number? So they always did,

2662
02:31:43,950 --> 02:31:46,440
I said 5,000,001 time and somebody
correct. They always correct.

2663
02:31:46,500 --> 02:31:48,180
It's always 6 million,
whatever the number is.

2664
02:31:48,181 --> 02:31:53,181
Some insane number of millions of people
were killed by this one group of humans

2665
02:31:53,790 --> 02:31:58,170
genocide. And there was something that
history and pictures are one of the,

2666
02:31:58,171 --> 02:32:02,430
one of the Twitter accounts that I
retweeted a few days ago that had, um,

2667
02:32:02,460 --> 02:32:06,810
they showed all these ss officers
laughing and with like kids in their labs.

2668
02:32:07,140 --> 02:32:09,810
And the caption was
something to the effect of,

2669
02:32:10,230 --> 02:32:14,550
don't ever think that the people that
you think of as monsters are not human.

2670
02:32:14,820 --> 02:32:18,900
Like humans are capable regulations
and capable of horrific,

2671
02:32:19,080 --> 02:32:21,270
monstrous behavior if
they all agree to it.

2672
02:32:22,140 --> 02:32:27,140
And so it showed these ss officers and
they just looked so normal and laughing

2673
02:32:27,750 --> 02:32:29,710
and ha. Meanwhile,

2674
02:32:30,180 --> 02:32:35,180
there's these Jewish skeleton people and
living in a cage just a few yards over.

2675
02:32:35,940 --> 02:32:39,710
Well that with a, isn't it what a
cabaret is about kind of, right.

2676
02:32:39,711 --> 02:32:41,700
I was watching the movies on CNN. Yeah.

2677
02:32:41,860 --> 02:32:44,580
They're kind of saying like cabaret
is like, it's, it's showing how like,

2678
02:32:44,610 --> 02:32:47,850
like all these funny like nice people
and they just pick their Nazis.

2679
02:32:48,820 --> 02:32:51,890
So I didn't see that movie and it was
in that movie. I forget who said it,

2680
02:32:51,980 --> 02:32:56,170
but I know it's like a
musical [inaudible] wow. Yeah.

2681
02:32:56,480 --> 02:32:59,640
I never saw it. It was really all
about, I didn't know that either.

2682
02:32:59,750 --> 02:33:02,970
I've watched that. I've learned about
through Tom Hanks is the movies on CNN.

2683
02:33:03,060 --> 02:33:08,040
Well you've obviously never seen the man
who killed Hitler and then bigfoot all

2684
02:33:08,041 --> 02:33:11,100
of it. It's my guy.

2685
02:33:11,170 --> 02:33:15,570
Do you understand why the
Nazis are so bad? Yeah, it's,

2686
02:33:16,710 --> 02:33:18,000
we haven't had, yeah, you're right.

2687
02:33:18,001 --> 02:33:21,240
We haven't had somebody as evil
as the Nazis. Right, right.

2688
02:33:21,241 --> 02:33:24,210
But they've tried to make guys
like that, you know, the Vietcong.

2689
02:33:24,690 --> 02:33:29,060
So don was saying bin Laden, but that
one was clear cut. Like everybody,

2690
02:33:29,160 --> 02:33:33,900
that was Jesus. Let's go get, Hilary
had to stop this, this mother fucker.

2691
02:33:34,050 --> 02:33:38,340
When you see him scream in front of the
crowd, like little Dutch. Fuck fuck.

2692
02:33:38,890 --> 02:33:40,320
Yeah. Why would you follow that?

2693
02:33:41,670 --> 02:33:44,740
They're all high on the fucking
methamphetamines, aren't they though? Um,

2694
02:33:44,880 --> 02:33:48,360
let's see. Yes. Okay. Even if
we don't know, eat that Nazis,

2695
02:33:48,450 --> 02:33:51,690
he was tripping the video of
him. He was definitely tripping.

2696
02:33:52,080 --> 02:33:53,490
He was rubbing his cane on his deck.

2697
02:33:53,550 --> 02:33:56,700
He was tweaking but a whole country
he's into that. They're just like, Eh,

2698
02:33:56,701 --> 02:33:58,200
this is our guy. We're going
to do whatever he says.

2699
02:33:58,670 --> 02:34:01,310
Yup. Yup. They didn't even know.

2700
02:34:01,970 --> 02:34:06,260
They didn't even know like what it meant
to have someone like him run a country

2701
02:34:06,261 --> 02:34:06,950
back then,

2702
02:34:06,950 --> 02:34:11,950
how drugs like Pervitin and cocaine
fueled the Nazi's rise and fall.

2703
02:34:12,470 --> 02:34:15,200
Wow. Despite Hitler's anti-drug rhetoric,

2704
02:34:15,380 --> 02:34:20,240
Nazi Germany used a little courage called
pervert tin to take Europe by stern

2705
02:34:20,290 --> 02:34:23,020
storm. And it turns out it
was pure methamphetamine.

2706
02:34:23,500 --> 02:34:28,210
It is perverts in
methamphetamine. Hydro chloride.

2707
02:34:28,240 --> 02:34:29,073
Who made that?

2708
02:34:29,370 --> 02:34:32,440
It looks like the fucking Germans did
cause it's [inaudible] know what I'm

2709
02:34:32,441 --> 02:34:33,910
saying? Like who? Like what company,

2710
02:34:34,140 --> 02:34:36,660
what companies making Pervitin
some Nazi company. Okay.

2711
02:34:37,000 --> 02:34:40,240
So they would just given out everybody
math could have messed up country.

2712
02:34:41,530 --> 02:34:45,100
That makes sense. That'll kill
6 million Jews. Yeah. Oh, okay.

2713
02:34:45,880 --> 02:34:49,480
It says still couldn't dick
ditch an access power meeting.

2714
02:34:49,481 --> 02:34:54,280
So Hitler's personal physician injected
the fewer with a drug called you could

2715
02:34:54,690 --> 02:34:58,810
doll think oxycodone combined
with cocaine to perk him up.

2716
02:34:59,470 --> 02:35:02,680
Some physician took a significant
risk in doing so. After all,

2717
02:35:02,860 --> 02:35:07,690
Hitler was prone to latching
on to addictive substances
and refusing to let go,

2718
02:35:07,930 --> 02:35:10,720
but in this case, the
injection seemed warranted.

2719
02:35:11,250 --> 02:35:14,500
Hitler was doubled over with
violent spastic constipation,

2720
02:35:14,740 --> 02:35:19,540
refusing to speak to anyone immediately
after the first injection and despite

2721
02:35:19,541 --> 02:35:20,620
his doctor's wishes,

2722
02:35:20,800 --> 02:35:25,800
a revived Hitler ordered another injection
hit with then left for the meeting

2723
02:35:26,021 --> 02:35:30,550
with a Gusto of a soldier half his
age. Okay, so it's like, yeah, he's,

2724
02:35:30,580 --> 02:35:34,450
he was messed up, man. He's taken
like super pills or whatever.

2725
02:35:34,470 --> 02:35:37,810
He was taking liquid cocaine
and meth and oxycodone.

2726
02:35:38,260 --> 02:35:42,910
Hitler reportedly spoke for several hours
without stopping at the meeting with

2727
02:35:42,911 --> 02:35:46,840
Mussolini. Hitler reportedly spoke
for several hours without stopping.

2728
02:35:46,960 --> 02:35:50,200
The Italian dictator who
sat massaging his own back,

2729
02:35:50,380 --> 02:35:52,870
dabbing his forehead with
a handkerchief and sighing,

2730
02:35:53,050 --> 02:35:56,140
had hoped to convince Hitler to
let Emily drop out of the war.

2731
02:35:56,500 --> 02:36:00,880
He never got the chance. And you hear
the word in edgewise. Oh my God. So cute.

2732
02:36:00,881 --> 02:36:03,850
Imagine being poor Mussolini.
You're over there talking to Hitler.

2733
02:36:04,060 --> 02:36:09,010
He's math out of his fucking mind
and you're trying to tell him,

2734
02:36:09,011 --> 02:36:12,730
look Italian, the, we don't want to go
to war. We went to back out of this.

2735
02:36:13,090 --> 02:36:17,280
We like to just kick it back,
you know, I mean a good luck.

2736
02:36:17,920 --> 02:36:22,600
We, you know, we hope for the best
and Hitler comes over all messed up.

2737
02:36:23,170 --> 02:36:25,930
Have you heard rose wakers?
Yes. Okay. Here it says,

2738
02:36:26,230 --> 02:36:28,570
Jamie is trying to show us this.
This is what, he won't let it go.

2739
02:36:28,910 --> 02:36:32,140
This is what one episode of mid
Hitler's all his daily drug use,

2740
02:36:32,141 --> 02:36:36,430
which included barbiturates,
old-school bull, semen,

2741
02:36:37,330 --> 02:36:40,030
bull, semen, bull, semen, testosterone,

2742
02:36:40,690 --> 02:36:45,430
opiates and stimulants such
as perfect 10 a courage pill.

2743
02:36:45,910 --> 02:36:50,240
So he was taking math. Isn't bull seem
like Torian or whatever pulls him in?

2744
02:36:50,320 --> 02:36:54,700
The story is lit like the sounds like
it would be like red bull is like,

2745
02:36:54,701 --> 02:36:55,720
it's supposed to be like something.

2746
02:36:55,810 --> 02:37:00,040
It's supposed to be like a small
bulges bullshit. Take that red bull.

2747
02:37:00,400 --> 02:37:04,960
That's again some serious don't.
I've heard Torres, am I right?

2748
02:37:05,440 --> 02:37:08,710
Is he right? Torian is
bull semen. Oh my God.

2749
02:37:10,500 --> 02:37:14,140
[inaudible] ingredient and Rainbow
Monster, rock star and other energy.

2750
02:37:14,170 --> 02:37:15,003
It's an organic,

2751
02:37:15,650 --> 02:37:19,340
not an amino acid for named
for the Latin tourists,

2752
02:37:19,341 --> 02:37:24,341
which means ox or bull because originally
Torian was extracted from bull sea

2753
02:37:25,580 --> 02:37:30,320
bull semen. So originally
taurine was extracted that way,

2754
02:37:30,560 --> 02:37:33,230
but it is an ingredient in bull semen.

2755
02:37:33,550 --> 02:37:36,410
So the Taurine and red bull probably
doesn't come from bull semen,

2756
02:37:36,411 --> 02:37:38,720
but taurine is in bull semen.

2757
02:37:39,260 --> 02:37:42,710
So Hitler was getting his
touring right from the tap,

2758
02:37:43,490 --> 02:37:45,140
from the source, sucked the bowls.

2759
02:37:45,340 --> 02:37:49,580
Dick defeat best way is to
suck a pond. It sucked out.

2760
02:37:49,710 --> 02:37:54,710
Did you get it from the tap and it is
fresh and it's 700 pounds more potent.

2761
02:37:56,180 --> 02:37:57,800
The fewer is just gets down there. They,

2762
02:37:57,960 --> 02:38:00,890
they hold the bull back with
straps and buckles. It's kicking

2763
02:38:02,970 --> 02:38:07,970
and the Hitler gets this sloppy Nazi
mouth right over that fat oh hog.

2764
02:38:08,450 --> 02:38:13,400
And that is apparently the origin of
that upper lip mustache with muscles to

2765
02:38:13,401 --> 02:38:17,510
catch all the succulent drops when
he's choking on Jay's [inaudible]

2766
02:38:19,050 --> 02:38:19,550
flavor savor.

2767
02:38:19,550 --> 02:38:24,110
And that giant bold Dick is pummeling
the back of his throat and fills it up

2768
02:38:24,410 --> 02:38:26,840
that when he comes out of his nose,

2769
02:38:27,290 --> 02:38:28,940
cause a lot of the gyms
comes out of his nose.

2770
02:38:29,030 --> 02:38:32,810
That's just enough
mustache to catch the ges.

2771
02:38:33,200 --> 02:38:35,720
So that's why he had that mustache.
A lot of people don't know,

2772
02:38:36,270 --> 02:38:39,210
I must say I believe that many tables
followed that kind of guy. I mean like,

2773
02:38:39,290 --> 02:38:41,160
and everybody's just on
average is cracked out.

2774
02:38:41,250 --> 02:38:44,700
It's a perfect is catching
mustache. If you think about it,

2775
02:38:44,750 --> 02:38:48,570
it's coming out of your nose, which it
does do, right? Like milk does, right?

2776
02:38:48,750 --> 02:38:50,820
You, yeah, you cough when you drink
it out and it comes out of your nose,

2777
02:38:51,020 --> 02:38:52,940
you'll see him. He's coming out of your
nose and humans coming out, you know?

2778
02:38:53,260 --> 02:38:57,930
Yeah man, he's catching
it. Savoring it. No,

2779
02:38:58,400 --> 02:39:00,660
you're saying, I mean, I'm
just saying how many people,

2780
02:39:00,690 --> 02:39:03,630
how many people were in Germany at that
time? How many people were in millions?

2781
02:39:03,631 --> 02:39:06,670
Were were SS soldiers. I wonder,
that's a good question, right?

2782
02:39:06,750 --> 02:39:10,290
How many people actually joined? Yeah.
Well, I think you had to be a part of it,

2783
02:39:10,291 --> 02:39:14,370
right? Otherwise or youth as
well. Yeah. It was a whole, yeah.

2784
02:39:14,371 --> 02:39:17,430
The whole society was that. It was
all, yeah, it became Nazi Germany,

2785
02:39:18,330 --> 02:39:22,020
national socialist. What
is it? What is the actual,

2786
02:39:22,080 --> 02:39:26,430
what does Nazi actually stand for? I mean,

2787
02:39:26,431 --> 02:39:30,720
didn't shut up for seven hours, dude. Oh,

2788
02:39:31,140 --> 02:39:32,220
national socialism.

2789
02:39:32,221 --> 02:39:36,220
I guess that's a national socialist
German Workers Party as what it was.

2790
02:39:36,730 --> 02:39:39,150
So they were socialists.
Now Imagine Paul Mussolini,

2791
02:39:40,980 --> 02:39:45,060
then he killed more people. Uh,
I don't know how many he killed.

2792
02:39:45,540 --> 02:39:49,110
How many of Mussolini? Stalin didn't he
kill the most? He killed the most. Yeah,

2793
02:39:49,111 --> 02:39:52,590
he's, yeah, he's like a, he's,
he's, he's Kareem Abdul Jabbar.

2794
02:39:52,770 --> 02:39:56,940
Have a mass murder. She's got
the points record too, man.

2795
02:39:57,960 --> 02:40:01,620
How do you, when you're a person like
that, and you didn't used to be a Stalin,

2796
02:40:02,160 --> 02:40:02,520
right?

2797
02:40:02,520 --> 02:40:05,100
You were just a person and then all of
a sudden you're in a position of power

2798
02:40:05,101 --> 02:40:09,660
and then all of a sudden
you're responsible for the
death of untold millions of

2799
02:40:09,661 --> 02:40:12,960
people, almost tunes.
So some was the most,

2800
02:40:13,140 --> 02:40:15,160
a long shot look at Mao,

2801
02:40:16,560 --> 02:40:20,340
Hitler and then stolen 17 yeah,

2802
02:40:20,660 --> 02:40:23,760
the Mussolini on the list. Okay. But Mao,

2803
02:40:24,200 --> 02:40:28,410
the mile was like 400 million, right?
So 78 but he, I don't know. Okay,

2804
02:40:28,440 --> 02:40:29,273
go Google.

2805
02:40:29,910 --> 02:40:32,880
Mao might've been responsible for 400
million because there was an article I was

2806
02:40:32,881 --> 02:40:35,220
reading yesterday, 400 million people.

2807
02:40:35,510 --> 02:40:38,820
That's that they revise the amount
of people that they think are,

2808
02:40:39,240 --> 02:40:42,780
were dead directly because of
mile. Okay. Oh, so like indirectly,

2809
02:40:42,781 --> 02:40:45,270
the earlier you were saying
directly killed 400 people,

2810
02:40:45,271 --> 02:40:48,780
some insane number of people
were killed during miles rain.

2811
02:40:50,010 --> 02:40:51,630
What are they saying?
That's crazy. Wait, wait.

2812
02:40:51,631 --> 02:40:53,920
There's a place called Mao's
kitchen. 5 million maybe.

2813
02:40:53,921 --> 02:40:58,650
Maybe I added a zero to it. Leap forward.
Maybe I added a zero most likely.

2814
02:40:59,160 --> 02:41:01,950
So 45 million and the
other ones had 70 so it's,

2815
02:41:02,400 --> 02:41:05,460
so it's between 45 and whatever
the other number is. But that,

2816
02:41:05,490 --> 02:41:08,460
so he's number one with a bullet. Wow.

2817
02:41:08,820 --> 02:41:11,940
He's the guy responsible for the most
death. During his time, again though,

2818
02:41:11,941 --> 02:41:13,350
there was a, there was
a kitchen, there was a,

2819
02:41:13,440 --> 02:41:15,980
a restaurant here in Los Angeles
called mouse kitchen. Jesus,

2820
02:41:16,630 --> 02:41:20,120
that's disrespectful as fuck. Tyson
has mal on his arm. Oh, does it? Well,

2821
02:41:20,130 --> 02:41:21,510
I mean, you know, he's
supposed to kill people,

2822
02:41:21,720 --> 02:41:24,960
but I was in Williams in jail I think.
Probably read some philosophy from Mao.

2823
02:41:25,740 --> 02:41:29,760
I mean, yeah, those guys. I mean those
guys great. They read good books.

2824
02:41:30,030 --> 02:41:33,870
Well my comp is a, it's pretty
good. Is it, did you read it?

2825
02:41:34,020 --> 02:41:37,320
I wrote it in English. Are you allowed
to read it now? Like when you read it,

2826
02:41:37,321 --> 02:41:38,550
you're probably allowed
to read it. Like if you,

2827
02:41:38,790 --> 02:41:40,100
I don't think you can buy it today. Yeah.

2828
02:41:40,110 --> 02:41:44,970
But he tried to buy mine on your kindle.
If you're like sales stuff, it's like,

2829
02:41:45,260 --> 02:41:47,190
it's, it's just like talking
about the sale. I mean,

2830
02:41:47,250 --> 02:41:49,770
it's obviously talking about,
you know, killing Jews,

2831
02:41:49,771 --> 02:41:52,950
but talking about like
the sale of, it's just,

2832
02:41:53,130 --> 02:41:56,580
it's talking about how they can overcome
and it's like his struggle is basically

2833
02:41:56,581 --> 02:41:58,950
just, it's a, it is a
propaganda book, but it's like,

2834
02:41:59,160 --> 02:42:02,130
it's from a sales perspective, you're
just like, I see where he's coming from.

2835
02:42:02,130 --> 02:42:04,740
Not Saying that I'm condoning it,
but I'm saying you're like, okay,

2836
02:42:04,741 --> 02:42:07,170
there's so much passion in it. You
know what I mean? It's like a minute.

2837
02:42:07,171 --> 02:42:08,004
It's like a memoir.

2838
02:42:08,010 --> 02:42:11,880
So he's selling to the people that they
can overcome the economic situation that

2839
02:42:11,881 --> 02:42:13,740
Germany's in and they can rise above this.

2840
02:42:14,340 --> 02:42:18,830
And if you tried to buy that today to
read it, people would assume I was young.

2841
02:42:18,860 --> 02:42:21,900
I read about the way I would
think, oh, you combine my income.

2842
02:42:22,050 --> 02:42:26,170
They buy it on Amazon, but come on son,
you know, you're on a list. Ah, you,

2843
02:42:26,190 --> 02:42:30,060
I am now. Right. I read in the
library, they like the library.

2844
02:42:30,061 --> 02:42:34,520
If you buy it today, you know this.
Yeah, for sure. Like better flag.

2845
02:42:34,530 --> 02:42:38,790
You're gonna list now. Oh yeah, for sure.
If you buy a Duke's, it had DVD set,

2846
02:42:38,940 --> 02:42:40,180
you're on the list. You're on the list.

2847
02:42:40,820 --> 02:42:44,630
We doing just faster if it's one on the
cover of the one with the general Lee

2848
02:42:44,631 --> 02:42:48,980
leaping over the fucking canyon with
the confederate fag flag clearly

2849
02:42:49,210 --> 02:42:51,260
booked at, I think it was maybe
the one you talk about a lot,

2850
02:42:51,261 --> 02:42:54,500
but I remember in the 90 [inaudible] late
nineties you people were saying if you

2851
02:42:54,501 --> 02:42:55,910
went into the bookstore to buy this book,

2852
02:42:55,911 --> 02:42:59,240
you're on a list and if you had to go
buy with cash and like wear a Hoodie and

2853
02:42:59,241 --> 02:43:04,010
cover your face. Yeah, I remember that.
It was always those stupid rumors. Yeah.

2854
02:43:04,320 --> 02:43:07,400
What was the book? I think it was the,
the cross book that you've talked about,

2855
02:43:07,401 --> 02:43:10,310
the Sacred Cross or oh, the sacred
mushroom in the cross. Yeah,

2856
02:43:10,880 --> 02:43:12,070
that's the one I would heard of. It

2857
02:43:12,220 --> 02:43:14,550
could have that. My rumor might
get passed around a lot. Yeah,

2858
02:43:14,810 --> 02:43:19,240
nine years or something. Do you
remember a course in miracles?

2859
02:43:21,110 --> 02:43:23,960
Of course in miracles is a
book that was going around,

2860
02:43:24,620 --> 02:43:28,520
I want to say in the
early, early nineties,

2861
02:43:29,360 --> 02:43:32,540
there was a bunch of people that were
telling you to read some book by this

2862
02:43:32,541 --> 02:43:37,490
couple and they were channeling an
angel. They wrote this book. And uh,

2863
02:43:37,580 --> 02:43:38,060
yeah,

2864
02:43:38,060 --> 02:43:43,060
it's one of those books where I like w
I don't know if it was any good because

2865
02:43:43,101 --> 02:43:45,740
everybody that recommended
it was so annoying

2866
02:43:47,500 --> 02:43:51,490
or like you pray love or was that the
other one? The A, the secret? Well,

2867
02:43:51,620 --> 02:43:55,640
it was extremely spiritual
air quotes and uh,

2868
02:43:55,790 --> 02:43:58,610
it was all about how to live
and it might've been, it
might be an amazing book,

2869
02:43:58,611 --> 02:44:01,590
but I remember everybody that wanted
to recommend that I always had like a,

2870
02:44:02,760 --> 02:44:03,593
that might,

2871
02:44:03,740 --> 02:44:06,650
I was a young man at the time and I was
very dismissive about a lot of things.

2872
02:44:06,650 --> 02:44:09,920
I wouldn't be dismissive
of today, but the,

2873
02:44:10,010 --> 02:44:14,520
I remember it was like one of those books
where annoying people loved it. Yeah.

2874
02:44:15,440 --> 02:44:17,310
You've got to read this book,
right? That kind of, yeah.

2875
02:44:17,390 --> 02:44:20,450
It's like this book
transformed me. It's a gift.

2876
02:44:20,810 --> 02:44:23,750
I'm giving you this book because I
want you to read it and it's going to

2877
02:44:24,170 --> 02:44:28,040
transform you to wow. This made me
getting my love to you. Maybe a,

2878
02:44:28,041 --> 02:44:31,880
I'm reading a book about someone who
said they were channeling and angel and

2879
02:44:31,881 --> 02:44:33,980
that's nonsense, right about that.

2880
02:44:35,420 --> 02:44:38,450
How about I have to think about
the fact it's a nonsense person.

2881
02:44:39,560 --> 02:44:43,560
Foundation for inner peace.
Look good. Look the light. Oh,

2882
02:44:43,740 --> 02:44:48,530
it looks like the dianetics
[inaudible] yeah. Oh, exactly. Yeah.

2883
02:44:48,670 --> 02:44:53,450
It's very cultish. What is the, um,
what's the origin of it? Is it, does it,

2884
02:44:53,451 --> 02:44:54,141
am I correct?

2885
02:44:54,141 --> 02:44:58,270
Did it come from someone who like
channeled an angel or some shit like that?

2886
02:45:00,150 --> 02:45:03,680
Isn't that the idea? Well,

2887
02:45:04,190 --> 02:45:07,070
let's Google. What is the origin

2888
02:45:09,340 --> 02:45:12,110
continue curriculum aiming at assisting
readers and achieving spiritual

2889
02:45:12,111 --> 02:45:12,944
transformation.

2890
02:45:13,700 --> 02:45:17,650
Am I conflating this with some other
book we were talking about in colors?

2891
02:45:17,651 --> 02:45:19,610
Someone was almost the same thing,

2892
02:45:19,700 --> 02:45:22,460
but where someone said that
like someone wrote it for them,

2893
02:45:22,490 --> 02:45:26,540
that it was like written as they
were channeling. Oh really? Like, oh,

2894
02:45:27,020 --> 02:45:32,020
Oprah to talk about it in 1982 did
they say that or am I making this up?

2895
02:45:33,460 --> 02:45:35,660
I'm trying to see what it says too quick.

2896
02:45:35,690 --> 02:45:40,590
So listen to Oprah's book clubs on Johnny
Carson to split. Got around 90, right.

2897
02:45:40,880 --> 02:45:43,880
I don't think you gonna follow it
to find it from there. Just Google.

2898
02:45:44,810 --> 02:45:48,980
What is the origin story for a course
of miracles, of course in miracles.

2899
02:45:50,420 --> 02:45:51,830
But it was one of those
books where you'd like,

2900
02:45:51,831 --> 02:45:55,490
if you were dating a yoga teacher or a
house, she'd have it on the coffee table,

2901
02:45:57,800 --> 02:46:02,720
on your way to the Vegan restaurant.
Let's go. You know, I mean,

2902
02:46:02,900 --> 02:46:04,340
cause you think like, if the Nazis do win,

2903
02:46:04,370 --> 02:46:08,480
that does become like the coffee
book and comp. Yeah. If the Nazis,

2904
02:46:08,870 --> 02:46:10,040
once super inspirational and

2905
02:46:10,200 --> 02:46:13,140
inner voice, she identified as Jesus, uh,

2906
02:46:14,180 --> 02:46:19,180
began interacting with her
and acted as a stimulus,

2907
02:46:19,340 --> 02:46:24,050
triggering a series of inner experiences
that were understood or to her as that.

2908
02:46:24,051 --> 02:46:24,880
And that's what she does.

2909
02:46:24,880 --> 02:46:27,660
So at the same guy who said, who wrote
the Mormon Bible said the same thing,

2910
02:46:27,950 --> 02:46:31,710
man. Yeah. Yeah. So that's
what it is. So I'm correct.

2911
02:46:32,220 --> 02:46:34,590
So it's like a Bible. Wow.

2912
02:46:34,591 --> 02:46:38,160
It's like one of those things
like maybe that happened.

2913
02:46:39,090 --> 02:46:40,200
Maybe that happened.

2914
02:46:40,380 --> 02:46:44,010
I mean sold some books obviously that
maybe you're crazy maybe or maybe you're

2915
02:46:44,011 --> 02:46:47,340
out of your fucking mind and you want
people to think that you're special.

2916
02:46:47,580 --> 02:46:50,380
So you wrote these rules on how
people should live and they,

2917
02:46:50,400 --> 02:46:51,960
they're pretty good. They're resonate.

2918
02:46:51,961 --> 02:46:55,680
Well that makes sense because you're not
selling the original Bible to a hundred

2919
02:46:55,681 --> 02:46:56,520
percent crazy.

2920
02:46:57,050 --> 02:47:00,090
This is good structure where we assume
that if someone tells a crazy story like

2921
02:47:00,091 --> 02:47:04,170
that, they're a hundred percent crazy.
Right? I didn't have any good ideas.

2922
02:47:04,171 --> 02:47:07,890
Like you could be a fucking crazy
person with a couple of good ideas.

2923
02:47:08,310 --> 02:47:12,570
Like Mike is fucking crazy.
But I'm telling you, they
said JK Rowling was crazy.

2924
02:47:12,720 --> 02:47:16,190
Oh, she's got to be crazy. So this,
she's got Harry Potter Shit right there.

2925
02:47:16,320 --> 02:47:21,290
That little boys. Yeah. Tell you right
in the mouth. Yeah. A little boys magic.

2926
02:47:22,220 --> 02:47:23,250
Actually. Cute little girl.

2927
02:47:23,750 --> 02:47:27,510
If [inaudible] let everyone
be happy and happy and happy.

2928
02:47:27,640 --> 02:47:29,760
Like you can be a woman and do
that, right? You can be a dude.

2929
02:47:29,761 --> 02:47:32,370
And do that because then you're like,
yeah dude, writing about a little boys.

2930
02:47:32,640 --> 02:47:36,060
Not Good. That's definitely a, that's
a flag to be able to get away with it.

2931
02:47:36,090 --> 02:47:36,740
Right?

2932
02:47:36,740 --> 02:47:41,740
Like Dr Seuss Twain wrote
about like huckleberry Finn
and those boys snort that.

2933
02:47:42,841 --> 02:47:47,340
I was like, oh well this all this
meth talk mushroom elixir. Oh,

2934
02:47:47,400 --> 02:47:52,290
you want something it's going to do to
me like lion's mane juice me up. No, no.

2935
02:47:52,450 --> 02:47:56,240
Should good for the brain. No perfect.
It doesn't taste bad either. Thank you.

2936
02:47:56,640 --> 02:47:59,190
Why is that actual lion's mane?
Yeah, lion's Mane. Mushroom,

2937
02:47:59,220 --> 02:48:02,250
not lion's like a lion.
Lion. It's a mushroom.

2938
02:48:02,820 --> 02:48:05,520
Just drink it all the time and I feel
like it'd be rude if I don't want you. So

2939
02:48:07,270 --> 02:48:08,103
you're the man.

2940
02:48:12,630 --> 02:48:13,463
Jeez.

2941
02:48:13,830 --> 02:48:15,940
I was going to correct something
you asked me earlier. Uh,

2942
02:48:16,080 --> 02:48:17,940
UFC 21 was when that changed,

2943
02:48:18,060 --> 02:48:23,060
there was a significant rule change and
they joined with the Council of Mixed

2944
02:48:23,400 --> 02:48:24,000
Martial Arts Commission.

2945
02:48:24,000 --> 02:48:27,360
You'll see 20 war prelim bouts it at
two rounds that were only five minutes.

2946
02:48:27,361 --> 02:48:31,260
Then three, five minute rounds
and championship bounds.
Change it five minutes.

2947
02:48:31,261 --> 02:48:33,000
They also, that's when they
added a 10 point must system.

2948
02:48:33,120 --> 02:48:34,740
So prelim rounds were two rounds.

2949
02:48:34,741 --> 02:48:39,450
Championship rounds were
three championships were
five [inaudible] everything

2950
02:48:39,451 --> 02:48:41,850
else was three. Oh, before
that. Cause there were,

2951
02:48:41,910 --> 02:48:43,320
so before that it was too though you said.

2952
02:48:43,321 --> 02:48:46,110
But this was also pre
Dana and pre cheetahs.

2953
02:48:46,200 --> 02:48:49,530
So they were still mixed like the
Gracie stuff, they were doing it.

2954
02:48:49,531 --> 02:48:52,560
So they just had five minute rounds
until the thing was over unlimited five

2955
02:48:52,561 --> 02:48:56,670
minute rounds. That's right. I remember
that Shit. That was a, that was madness.

2956
02:48:56,970 --> 02:49:01,680
But it wasn't as bad in terms
of badness as the Japanese ones.

2957
02:49:01,681 --> 02:49:05,460
The Japanese ones were fucking
crazy. They did so many nutty things.

2958
02:49:06,240 --> 02:49:08,100
They had so like

2959
02:49:08,760 --> 02:49:11,120
crazy freak shows and
they still do. Right.

2960
02:49:11,210 --> 02:49:15,960
They had this lady named Gabby Garcia.
She's like six foot two, 240 pounds.

2961
02:49:16,030 --> 02:49:18,210
Amazon they have are
fighting like housewives.

2962
02:49:18,240 --> 02:49:21,390
She beats loves his ladies and
it's all consensual. Right?

2963
02:49:21,391 --> 02:49:25,560
Like when they're signing up they like
freak shows. You're right. They, I mean,

2964
02:49:25,561 --> 02:49:29,350
yeah, look at their game shows. Yeah,
exactly. All that is going on with that.

2965
02:49:29,520 --> 02:49:32,700
It's just cause I think there's such a
repress country, aren't they? I think so.

2966
02:49:32,890 --> 02:49:33,930
Yeah. I think this is like,

2967
02:49:34,050 --> 02:49:36,630
I don't think they have like vending
machines where like guys have like there's

2968
02:49:36,631 --> 02:49:41,220
Gabby, look at that. I wrote a mud.
She's spending of housewives. Look it up.

2969
02:49:41,280 --> 02:49:42,420
Look at the guns. Yeah.

2970
02:49:42,421 --> 02:49:46,620
We'll pull up a video of her given SWAPO
that's Rhonda Rousey. That's not real.

2971
02:49:46,650 --> 02:49:49,180
This is real Abby. That's fine. It's real.

2972
02:49:49,200 --> 02:49:50,940
So look at the size of that
woman that she has to fight.

2973
02:49:51,270 --> 02:49:54,030
I mean like what is up with the
definition though, Gabby? Um,

2974
02:49:54,690 --> 02:49:58,790
Mexican supplements. Hundred
percent. Nice. I don't use gap.

2975
02:49:59,130 --> 02:50:00,130
Keep it 100

2976
02:50:03,150 --> 02:50:07,550
sounds bigger than your trader.
[inaudible] silver. Yeah, that's nuts.

2977
02:50:07,560 --> 02:50:12,180
That's crazy. Yeah. She's a big lady.
But uh, so anyway, Japan loves him.

2978
02:50:12,300 --> 02:50:13,530
That was when she was real thin.

2979
02:50:13,590 --> 02:50:18,330
At one point in time she'd gotten like
real ripped and small and then got right

2980
02:50:18,331 --> 02:50:19,860
back up to gigantic.

2981
02:50:19,861 --> 02:50:24,780
I again to win in these fucking
Japanese events. She in a UFC?

2982
02:50:24,870 --> 02:50:29,040
No, she fights for, I think I'm
going to, which one might be rising

2983
02:50:32,960 --> 02:50:36,650
pop out randomly. It doesn't say which
one, but um, yeah, Washington like, uh,

2984
02:50:37,160 --> 02:50:40,970
so I mean, well she's bigger than like
every female and UFC. Yeah. She's giant.

2985
02:50:41,060 --> 02:50:45,650
She's got no, she ended a division.
Yeah, she's giant. She's a six too. Jeez.

2986
02:50:45,770 --> 02:50:47,810
I mean, she's in the

2987
02:50:49,700 --> 02:50:53,360
240 pound weight class. Somewhere
like that. A heavyweight.

2988
02:50:53,480 --> 02:50:58,460
It'd be heavyweights and male. Right.
And you can't, yeah, Gabby. Oh,

2989
02:50:58,820 --> 02:51:03,590
I'm going to be 62 no heavyweight female
weight class was her a couple of weeks

2990
02:51:03,590 --> 02:51:06,920
ago. It's not that big anymore. Oh,
she's shrinking down. [inaudible] hey,

2991
02:51:07,070 --> 02:51:10,820
good for her. What up? Still?
Probably 200 pounds. Damn. Okay.

2992
02:51:10,821 --> 02:51:14,750
So she's jacked and Tan again. She
looks great. Thin. Yeah, look good.

2993
02:51:15,230 --> 02:51:20,150
She's strong as fuck. And she's a
world champion Jujitsu player too,

2994
02:51:20,510 --> 02:51:22,640
so she grabs a hold. These
girls just pummels them,

2995
02:51:23,240 --> 02:51:27,110
but they had Bob Sapp back in the day.
Like I said, he was like 375 pounds.

2996
02:51:27,200 --> 02:51:31,430
It was fighting. Guys were in like the
two hundreds he smashed so many people.

2997
02:51:31,850 --> 02:51:33,320
There was so many guys like that,

2998
02:51:33,321 --> 02:51:35,210
that fought in Japan where
they had these freak shows.

2999
02:51:35,300 --> 02:51:38,560
I mean crazy as if I saw one the other
day, like the thing where like a uh,

3000
02:51:38,600 --> 02:51:42,960
like a woman than her nipples were just
like almost like a like cones and then

3001
02:51:42,970 --> 02:51:46,190
like the game shows like these guys are
just like put their fingers in the is

3002
02:51:46,320 --> 02:51:48,410
just wild. I mean there's just
so many wild things in Japan.

3003
02:51:48,411 --> 02:51:50,690
Like you can see things. It is gnarly Bro.

3004
02:51:50,720 --> 02:51:53,930
Well they are the birth of a lot
of those crazy game shows, right?

3005
02:51:55,220 --> 02:51:57,860
I mean a lot of the game
shows like even fear factor.

3006
02:51:57,861 --> 02:52:00,890
Like would that have even happened if
it wasn't for the crazy Japanese shows?

3007
02:52:00,970 --> 02:52:02,900
What's in the water with it
to make them think like the,

3008
02:52:03,130 --> 02:52:04,970
and we were saying they were
oppressed but it's also,

3009
02:52:05,020 --> 02:52:07,780
I mean why they sober pressed?
Have you ever seen Bazooka man?

3010
02:52:09,690 --> 02:52:10,230
[inaudible] [inaudible]

3011
02:52:10,230 --> 02:52:15,230
man was a Japanese game show where a
guy with a bazooka would show up at

3012
02:52:15,281 --> 02:52:18,490
people's houses. Okay. I
think a real live bazooka,

3013
02:52:18,550 --> 02:52:21,250
like with like missile in bed, be in bed,

3014
02:52:21,251 --> 02:52:26,251
sleeping and bazooka man would shoot
the bazooka at your wall above your head

3015
02:52:27,790 --> 02:52:32,560
while you were asleep. This is a real
film. It what? They would film it.

3016
02:52:32,590 --> 02:52:33,940
This thing will explode above your head.

3017
02:52:33,941 --> 02:52:37,810
Shoots a rocket launcher
through your fucking wall. Boom.

3018
02:52:37,811 --> 02:52:41,470
And these guys like they
wake up fucking screaming.

3019
02:52:41,530 --> 02:52:46,120
There's a hole in the wall above the
head and the audience in Japan's like ha

3020
02:52:46,750 --> 02:52:51,460
ha. Do you have, you can find
it. You can find the videos.

3021
02:52:52,000 --> 02:52:53,920
Barbara, Jamie and find it. What is that?

3022
02:52:53,921 --> 02:52:57,600
That's a real [inaudible] had a
different name maybe rocking man.

3023
02:52:58,390 --> 02:53:00,400
[inaudible] man. Okay. So I'm
pretty sure it was bazooka man.

3024
02:53:00,430 --> 02:53:03,280
And it's a real rocket, whatever it is.

3025
02:53:03,280 --> 02:53:06,800
It's firing out of a cannon that's on
his shoulders and it's hitting the wall

3026
02:53:06,980 --> 02:53:08,590
and explodes. Right.

3027
02:53:08,620 --> 02:53:12,910
Google Japanese game show
where they blow up wall behind.

3028
02:53:12,970 --> 02:53:15,310
I mean I have like a heart
attack and like when you wake up,

3029
02:53:15,311 --> 02:53:18,300
like they're dead asleep. Yeah, easily
could. And that's what I'm saying. Until,

3030
02:53:18,340 --> 02:53:20,530
I mean you must like sound like
a death warrant for you. Uh,

3031
02:53:20,980 --> 02:53:24,510
for sure he could definitely get a heart
attack though Jesus. And like you said,

3032
02:53:24,610 --> 02:53:27,790
it's like dead asleep and they all sign
up for this is all consensual basically.

3033
02:53:27,850 --> 02:53:31,720
Okay. Understand. I don't
think they sign up for it.

3034
02:53:31,721 --> 02:53:33,280
I think they're just allowed
to do stuff like that.

3035
02:53:33,281 --> 02:53:36,010
And then they give you money.
Okay. If you survive. Right.

3036
02:53:36,040 --> 02:53:39,130
Well I don't think they have the same
concept of lawsuits that we do over here.

3037
02:53:39,690 --> 02:53:40,523
Okay.

3038
02:53:41,250 --> 02:53:44,130
You got it. Oh No, no. I'm on my way
to finding it though. I found one a,

3039
02:53:44,200 --> 02:53:49,200
this is called the bum show where girls
would put their bum in a hole and a guy

3040
02:53:49,500 --> 02:53:53,530
would kiss it or eat their ass basically.

3041
02:53:54,090 --> 02:53:58,230
Right on t v okay. Yeah.

3042
02:53:59,100 --> 02:54:01,200
Can't comment on that one. They
have different ways of living.

3043
02:54:01,260 --> 02:54:05,880
They really do have a different style.
Can hate it. Can Be Hating on him.

3044
02:54:06,300 --> 02:54:08,710
Jesus. Is it China or
Japan where they have a,

3045
02:54:08,760 --> 02:54:11,940
like they have like these crazy
work hours, right? Like, like Steve,

3046
02:54:11,960 --> 02:54:14,320
like factory workers were like, you
know, just like the whole kind of me.

3047
02:54:14,430 --> 02:54:15,330
It's just like work all the time.

3048
02:54:15,540 --> 02:54:18,120
And they have vending machines where
you can just like pocket posts these

3049
02:54:18,121 --> 02:54:21,390
basically. Oof. Yeah. They'd like
the guys were just like there. Yeah.

3050
02:54:21,391 --> 02:54:24,540
They'll just use those things. They'll
toss them. Oh, then just go back to work.

3051
02:54:24,600 --> 02:54:29,200
Oh yeah. Wow. I want to say that's,
that's Japan. That could be,

3052
02:54:29,330 --> 02:54:33,480
well they both have, they're
both known for their work hours,

3053
02:54:34,020 --> 02:54:37,530
you know, so like sex just isn't a part
of the routine that was watching some,

3054
02:54:37,990 --> 02:54:38,490
um,

3055
02:54:38,490 --> 02:54:42,840
document around or reading something
rather on Huawei while always this Chinese

3056
02:54:42,841 --> 02:54:47,250
phone company and the guy had a bed
underneath his desk as crazy as image.

3057
02:54:47,280 --> 02:54:52,280
He's in his cubicle and his stuff is above
him and he's got a bed laid out under

3058
02:54:52,351 --> 02:54:56,100
his cubicle and he's asleep
with his, like glasses at work.

3059
02:54:56,101 --> 02:55:01,101
Exhausted isn't really an 18 hour day
probably making cell phones so we could

3060
02:55:01,581 --> 02:55:05,780
take selfies. I like the way China has
like the biggest, uh, economy though.

3061
02:55:06,380 --> 02:55:11,000
The biggest. Yeah. Don't they are the
number one, Huh? Yeah. The Chinese,

3062
02:55:11,180 --> 02:55:15,160
I've been pretty right on this whole
episode, Joe. Very right. Shocking.

3063
02:55:16,310 --> 02:55:20,180
Damn [inaudible]. So the
largest economy, China

3064
02:55:24,780 --> 02:55:25,613
and what's number two?

3065
02:55:27,090 --> 02:55:30,210
It's American number two because
that's somebody he used to tell Trump.

3066
02:55:30,720 --> 02:55:32,610
He keeps saying number one. Yeah. Yeah.

3067
02:55:32,611 --> 02:55:35,790
I'm sorry to hurt anybody that didn't
know that. But China's number one.

3068
02:55:36,110 --> 02:55:40,160
Well I guess it depends on what you're
using to gauge economy as a general.

3069
02:55:40,220 --> 02:55:41,450
It's like not as just a thing.

3070
02:55:41,560 --> 02:55:43,540
Oh, it's not subjective. I'm
sorry. It's not the objective

3071
02:55:44,240 --> 02:55:47,590
p or you know, give me people,

3072
02:55:47,830 --> 02:55:52,830
cause it says our GDP is 19.3 9 trillion
and China's is 12 which is their

3073
02:55:54,221 --> 02:55:57,310
nominal, but over more people,
I guess it's 23 trillion.

3074
02:55:57,311 --> 02:55:58,660
So that's technically
higher. That's where it goes.

3075
02:55:58,661 --> 02:55:59,494
I don't know what you want to,

3076
02:55:59,560 --> 02:56:04,090
okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. What
you're basing your economy on, so GDP,

3077
02:56:04,091 --> 02:56:06,280
we're killing it. But as
far as large as the economy,

3078
02:56:06,281 --> 02:56:08,940
it's the Chinese [inaudible]
got way more people. Okay.

3079
02:56:08,950 --> 02:56:09,910
So that's probably why though,

3080
02:56:10,430 --> 02:56:13,630
as large as kind of maybe because they
more paypal a billion humans, right?

3081
02:56:13,810 --> 02:56:17,260
Yeah. Does India bigger than the
biggest country still? China?

3082
02:56:18,160 --> 02:56:21,880
That's another good question. Yeah, I
think it's close. That's our hot race.

3083
02:56:22,740 --> 02:56:23,573
China and India.

3084
02:56:23,590 --> 02:56:25,470
Yeah. Is there stuff from earlier
this year saying in China,

3085
02:56:25,680 --> 02:56:29,340
in India are gaining on the u s as the
world's top economy or they're poised to

3086
02:56:29,341 --> 02:56:33,690
take over next year? So I don't think it
really just depends on what you want to

3087
02:56:33,780 --> 02:56:36,000
imagine. If Trump is onto
something with all these sanctions.

3088
02:56:37,050 --> 02:56:39,330
Imagine you're talking about the
a that health insurance thing.

3089
02:56:39,331 --> 02:56:41,250
Earlier I learned a weird thing. I,

3090
02:56:41,251 --> 02:56:45,750
a British comic had told me when I was
over in London last year doing the,

3091
02:56:45,800 --> 02:56:48,570
the roast battle over there
and uh, he was like, you know,

3092
02:56:48,571 --> 02:56:49,920
like you guys don't have
free healthcare. He's like,

3093
02:56:49,921 --> 02:56:53,100
but your healthcare is better. He's
like, usually when I get like a,

3094
02:56:53,101 --> 02:56:55,720
he had like a bronchial
thing and he's like, uh,

3095
02:56:55,770 --> 02:56:58,020
normally takes like two weeks for
that to cure over here. He's like,

3096
02:56:58,021 --> 02:57:01,580
I went to America, took like 48
hours. That's what we're paying for.

3097
02:57:01,600 --> 02:57:05,700
Just the better drugs. That makes
sense. Not just better drugs,

3098
02:57:05,701 --> 02:57:09,180
but like probably more motivated
doctors, but he was getting paid.

3099
02:57:09,210 --> 02:57:12,600
But are they more motivated to keep
people in and out of their office and

3100
02:57:12,601 --> 02:57:17,040
shuffle them quick and stuffed them
up with pills versus we're an England,

3101
02:57:17,070 --> 02:57:20,800
they're not motivated
by like a quota. Right.

3102
02:57:20,880 --> 02:57:23,700
Maybe they're just just trying to help.

3103
02:57:23,820 --> 02:57:27,420
Maybe it's different because they get
paid a certain amount and healthcare is

3104
02:57:27,421 --> 02:57:31,350
free and they're not motivated
to earn additional profit by,

3105
02:57:31,980 --> 02:57:32,670
you know,

3106
02:57:32,670 --> 02:57:37,110
suggesting surgeries or making
someone get on medication.

3107
02:57:37,920 --> 02:57:42,040
I don't know. But it's all, I mean
if you're talking about it, listen,

3108
02:57:42,240 --> 02:57:44,850
I'm a doctor, I'm making money over
here. Right. When you want to keep a guy,

3109
02:57:44,851 --> 02:57:47,180
you know, sick as possible, he can
make more money out of them. Yeah,

3110
02:57:47,220 --> 02:57:50,190
but that's like say some dark
conspiracy type thing. Definitely.

3111
02:57:50,220 --> 02:57:52,410
How many people are really
thinking like that? Right.

3112
02:57:52,560 --> 02:57:55,050
But I'm saying like two weeks
to encrypt it. Like 48 hours.

3113
02:57:55,300 --> 02:57:57,870
It's just a shittier system.
That's what I'm saying.

3114
02:57:58,240 --> 02:58:01,980
May Be the argument can be made that
profit based systems are efficient because

3115
02:58:01,980 --> 02:58:03,750
people are more aggressive
cause they want them,

3116
02:58:03,840 --> 02:58:07,680
they want to make money because they get
things handled quicker and they believe

3117
02:58:07,681 --> 02:58:10,490
in it more. It's almost like I'm
getting what I paid for. Maybe. Yeah.

3118
02:58:10,890 --> 02:58:11,380
I don't know. I,

3119
02:58:11,380 --> 02:58:14,430
I think it would be nice if people
didn't go out without health care though.

3120
02:58:14,490 --> 02:58:17,970
The problem is like the idea
that health is not a human right.

3121
02:58:18,460 --> 02:58:22,660
If that's not a human right,
what else do they have?

3122
02:58:22,960 --> 02:58:26,670
Like kids hurt and you just going
to let them die because they don't,

3123
02:58:26,700 --> 02:58:29,880
they don't contribute
enough change. You know,

3124
02:58:29,881 --> 02:58:30,940
they didn't put enough money in the,

3125
02:58:30,980 --> 02:58:34,740
in the box and basically bankrupt
now because I got a great knee.

3126
02:58:35,070 --> 02:58:40,070
It seems crazy that we would somehow or
another keep people from medical care.

3127
02:58:41,100 --> 02:58:41,970
I cannot have enough money.

3128
02:58:41,971 --> 02:58:44,010
Like that should be like the
number one thing that they had.

3129
02:58:44,010 --> 02:58:48,840
Care Food and medical care, food, shelter,
medical care, those things, you know,

3130
02:58:48,841 --> 02:58:52,380
not necessarily in that order. The
fact that medical, you're on your own.

3131
02:58:53,040 --> 02:58:53,873
Like what?

3132
02:58:55,140 --> 02:58:59,610
How come we can't pay for that when we
couldn't pay for the this and paid for

3133
02:58:59,620 --> 02:59:04,440
that and we can fund that and fund
this and we're going to go to the moon

3134
02:59:04,440 --> 02:59:07,530
tomorrow. But you gave, yeah,
but you can have healthcare.

3135
02:59:08,430 --> 02:59:12,000
But then again, it's like people
are so resistant to socialism,

3136
02:59:12,001 --> 02:59:15,570
like they don't want anybody
taking over and Nazis weren't. No,

3137
02:59:15,600 --> 02:59:19,030
they fucked up though. Look where that
ended. That's true. Terrible. Yeah.

3138
02:59:19,080 --> 02:59:22,290
They're all, they're all meth.
That's true. They're messed up.

3139
02:59:22,440 --> 02:59:23,860
Maybe non messed up socially.

3140
02:59:25,980 --> 02:59:28,800
But the problem is people are almost
all messed up here now with the fucking

3141
02:59:28,801 --> 02:59:32,780
Adderall thing. Yeah. Oh
yeah. Or the other on downers.

3142
02:59:32,790 --> 02:59:36,990
Like Xanax dude. Yeah, one of the other,
but Adderall might as well be math get,

3143
02:59:37,350 --> 02:59:41,520
it's some, it's cocaine. It's, it's
amphetamine. It's an amphetamine.

3144
02:59:41,580 --> 02:59:44,100
It's fucking straight up
amphetamine, you know?

3145
02:59:44,101 --> 02:59:46,740
And some people that helps some people
that works for them, but other people,

3146
02:59:46,860 --> 02:59:49,790
they just chew it all day long
and talk crazy. Talk Crazy.

3147
02:59:49,810 --> 02:59:52,890
Told me get the mouth crazy.
I mean, no one's against them.

3148
02:59:53,070 --> 02:59:57,690
Coke is the most annoying
drug. I mean it's the worst.

3149
02:59:58,260 --> 02:59:58,530
Yeah.

3150
02:59:58,530 --> 03:00:00,930
Just as on the noise level because
people are just talking about nothing the

3151
03:00:00,931 --> 03:00:04,290
whole time. You know? We just want to
talk to you talk right in your face.

3152
03:00:04,460 --> 03:00:07,890
Super pumped up like Hitler.
He imagined they injected him.

3153
03:00:08,610 --> 03:00:13,220
Two doses of oxycodone and cocaine to any,

3154
03:00:13,330 --> 03:00:17,040
it hits me again. The doctors I could
kinda like can't teach you again.

3155
03:00:18,690 --> 03:00:22,530
They hit him again. He goes directly
to Mussolini's house like, Oh God,

3156
03:00:22,710 --> 03:00:27,510
like he's so annoying. Coke fueled five
hour rent and rain. Poor Mussolini.

3157
03:00:27,511 --> 03:00:31,760
I just want to make a pizza.
Hang out. I want to go to Capri.

3158
03:00:31,890 --> 03:00:35,850
And when they go fishing with my
grandson, there's just like no,

3159
03:00:35,851 --> 03:00:38,850
the Cho and just losing his mom like God.

3160
03:00:39,090 --> 03:00:42,900
Imagine that this whole
thing was fueled by meth.

3161
03:00:43,740 --> 03:00:47,610
Like that was responsible
for the whole fucking chaos.

3162
03:00:47,820 --> 03:00:51,390
All that's fueled because if you
stop and think about history,

3163
03:00:52,230 --> 03:00:56,860
there's obviously been some
horrific, you know, campaigns. Well,

3164
03:00:57,120 --> 03:01:00,550
whether it's Alexander
the Great Gangas Kahn,

3165
03:01:00,730 --> 03:01:03,160
what are they on? You know what I
mean? What are they going to say?

3166
03:01:03,670 --> 03:01:04,421
That's how I was going to say,

3167
03:01:04,421 --> 03:01:08,500
like if these guys in the
Nazi party were all on Meth,

3168
03:01:08,770 --> 03:01:11,800
which makes total sense.
They were so psychotic. Dude,

3169
03:01:12,430 --> 03:01:17,280
what would the fucking Mongols on?
Will they just drunk? Yeah. Was it?

3170
03:01:17,440 --> 03:01:19,720
Yeah. Cause there was like, were
they, was that the opium den time?

3171
03:01:19,990 --> 03:01:23,150
That wasn't dens. I know. Yeah, they
definitely must had opiod Dems, right?

3172
03:01:23,160 --> 03:01:26,560
Yeah. They must've had
that. Is that their era?

3173
03:01:27,220 --> 03:01:29,470
I mean the gang is coming. I
hope Ian's been around forever.

3174
03:01:29,950 --> 03:01:33,250
Everybody had opium, but
it's what did, but that also,

3175
03:01:33,251 --> 03:01:36,650
that mellows you out though, right?
That shouldn't make you a killer. Wow.

3176
03:01:36,670 --> 03:01:40,070
The Vikings were in the mushrooms,
which is weird. Really? Yeah.

3177
03:01:40,090 --> 03:01:42,350
Like psychedelic mushrooms. Psilocybin.

3178
03:01:43,930 --> 03:01:45,370
They would take psilocybin,

3179
03:01:45,400 --> 03:01:48,880
they would fucking go on crusades and
start smashing heads. Oh, that's probably,

3180
03:01:49,040 --> 03:01:52,600
well, they're all so, you know, they're
grown to be like that, so I think, yeah.

3181
03:01:52,710 --> 03:01:55,000
You know, so little side was going to
take you where you want to go. Yeah.

3182
03:01:55,030 --> 03:01:56,890
Because it's also their world.

3183
03:01:57,880 --> 03:02:02,140
Their world is like cutting and slashing,
attacking. It's like they're not,

3184
03:02:02,380 --> 03:02:05,410
the idea of that not being there. That's
not even an option. Exactly. Yeah.

3185
03:02:05,470 --> 03:02:07,510
I mean, you talk about Bell House. I
mean that's what they're thinking about.

3186
03:02:07,511 --> 03:02:09,790
They're just like, we're just killing
people, but it's like, it's heaven.

3187
03:02:09,880 --> 03:02:11,470
Like we get to, we get to kill everybody.

3188
03:02:11,920 --> 03:02:16,570
What a crazy reward from murder.

3189
03:02:17,210 --> 03:02:21,760
You go to heaven and you drink
with Odin, going to go to Valhalla.

3190
03:02:22,830 --> 03:02:27,140
Can people apartments or just
can't wait to see Odin. Ah,

3191
03:02:29,570 --> 03:02:32,530
ah. And then you take
that Arrow and the neck.

3192
03:02:35,050 --> 03:02:37,870
You get to go to Valhalla for
happy. You got to go to Valhalla.

3193
03:02:38,140 --> 03:02:40,690
There was watch that show vikings. Now
people will tell me it's great though.

3194
03:02:40,691 --> 03:02:41,141
It was a great,

3195
03:02:41,141 --> 03:02:46,141
really fucking good man up until like
season four or five Mrs Rogan had to stop.

3196
03:02:47,400 --> 03:02:50,620
No did shake anymore. That's a lot
of fucking pretty extreme violence.

3197
03:02:50,950 --> 03:02:54,010
It gets a little bit handle it. It
gets a little gnarly and there's not,

3198
03:02:54,100 --> 03:02:56,810
the combat sports guy is not enough. Uh,

3199
03:02:56,950 --> 03:03:00,160
good people like route for Vikings.

3200
03:03:00,910 --> 03:03:02,650
Everybody's kind of a
piece of shit. You're like,

3201
03:03:02,651 --> 03:03:05,190
why am I watching these pieces?
Shifts, rape and murder each other.

3202
03:03:05,350 --> 03:03:10,050
And brothers would turn on brothers.
Mean, it's dark. And those are like the,

3203
03:03:10,051 --> 03:03:13,240
those are like the true Caucasians,
right? Oh yeah. Oh yeah.

3204
03:03:13,270 --> 03:03:15,880
They're the message. Northern Warriors,

3205
03:03:16,150 --> 03:03:20,530
the ones who escaped from the southern
climates and figured out how to survive

3206
03:03:20,890 --> 03:03:24,070
in the coldest fucking places in
the world. Oh yeah. And there's a,

3207
03:03:24,280 --> 03:03:26,470
there's like a nature rule,

3208
03:03:26,680 --> 03:03:31,680
not a rule like a law in terms of like
the size of things that live where it's

3209
03:03:31,691 --> 03:03:36,400
cold. So like if you
have a deer in Mexico,

3210
03:03:37,000 --> 03:03:41,020
it might be a hundred pounds, but
if you have a deer in Saskatchewan,

3211
03:03:41,021 --> 03:03:44,800
it might be like 300 pounds because of
the weapon species or something about

3212
03:03:44,801 --> 03:03:48,760
real cold climate makes things grow
bigger and stronger cause it's an, oh,

3213
03:03:48,761 --> 03:03:50,750
that's like, it's reacting to
the environment, right? Yeah.

3214
03:03:51,190 --> 03:03:54,570
It's something about a body
temperature as well that they,

3215
03:03:54,700 --> 03:03:57,010
in order to maintain body
temperature that you need a lot of.

3216
03:03:58,040 --> 03:04:00,500
And so like polar bears are
the biggest of the bears.

3217
03:04:00,800 --> 03:04:02,300
They live in the coldest fucking place.

3218
03:04:02,330 --> 03:04:04,220
And those Caucasian vikings
are the biggest dude.

3219
03:04:04,360 --> 03:04:07,930
Nice land motherfuckers
Icelandic, just giant dudes. Yeah.

3220
03:04:07,970 --> 03:04:12,440
That mountain from game of Thrones,
right? Yes. Yes. That's what that is.

3221
03:04:12,830 --> 03:04:15,290
That's no early. That's gnarly.
And he wanted to play basketball.

3222
03:04:16,480 --> 03:04:21,080
He want to play basketball cause he
ain't even made yet. Get both. No. Okay.

3223
03:04:21,320 --> 03:04:22,880
No, I don't think he knows how to fight.

3224
03:04:23,150 --> 03:04:26,800
There was a video of him sparring with
Conor McGregor and carm Connor McGregor

3225
03:04:26,890 --> 03:04:31,610
is fucking him up. What? That guy?
Yeah, and Connor mean, Connor's not a,

3226
03:04:31,700 --> 03:04:32,720
he's not weighing in.

3227
03:04:32,721 --> 03:04:37,100
So he's probably weighing about one
70 and game of Thrones guys, easy.

3228
03:04:37,101 --> 03:04:38,680
Three three is easy.

3229
03:04:39,320 --> 03:04:44,320
I would imagine he's in the three 2140
range and he's like a bodybuilder too,

3230
03:04:44,421 --> 03:04:47,390
so he's like chasing Connor and
Connor's cracking them in the stomach.

3231
03:04:48,320 --> 03:04:52,760
It's kind of a crazy video to watch. I
will see you see exactly the, pull it up.

3232
03:04:52,910 --> 03:04:57,200
Boom. Totally cut it. Five, nine
uh, this guy is what? Six seven?

3233
03:04:57,260 --> 03:04:59,660
He's taller than five. Nine. I
think Connor might be five now.

3234
03:04:59,661 --> 03:05:02,440
It might be five 10. I'm five.
Eight. He's a well disrespected.

3235
03:05:02,540 --> 03:05:04,270
She call her McGregor.
Oh, he's a beast. Yeah.

3236
03:05:04,280 --> 03:05:08,030
You get the hardest eight foot person.
He doesn't give a fuck. Yeah. I mean,

3237
03:05:08,031 --> 03:05:12,050
the guy fought Floyd Mayweather with
zero professional boxing fights.

3238
03:05:12,320 --> 03:05:15,110
Just stop and think about that. No,
he's here. Right? He took a zero.

3239
03:05:15,140 --> 03:05:16,730
So He's a legit, here's,

3240
03:05:17,240 --> 03:05:21,190
Connor was probably about a buck 70
look at the size difference here.

3241
03:05:21,710 --> 03:05:24,140
And they're like sparring
and Connor's moving around.

3242
03:05:24,850 --> 03:05:29,390
He's punched him in the stomach and the
guys trying to tag on tag and tried to

3243
03:05:29,391 --> 03:05:32,350
grab him. But Connor let him grab,
but he's not doing anything. He's,

3244
03:05:32,360 --> 03:05:34,190
he's controlling the guys trying to do,

3245
03:05:34,250 --> 03:05:36,920
so they're really spoiling
the guys trying to grab him,

3246
03:05:36,921 --> 03:05:37,820
but he doesn't know what he's doing.

3247
03:05:38,660 --> 03:05:41,060
And then he's like high five
and Kyle's like, no, no, no,

3248
03:05:41,070 --> 03:05:44,240
we're gonna keep going. We're
gonna keep going. So now he starts,

3249
03:05:44,520 --> 03:05:46,870
he starts kicking him, starts
kicking him in the [inaudible].

3250
03:05:47,600 --> 03:05:50,060
See he just punched him in the stomach
and the big guy, I know what to do.

3251
03:05:50,480 --> 03:05:54,230
He's trying to grab him, but it
Kinda is like, come on lad. I can,

3252
03:05:54,231 --> 03:05:57,290
I keep going monster. Yeah.

3253
03:05:57,440 --> 03:06:01,190
So probably Connor knows that this
big motherfucker can't keep this up.

3254
03:06:02,420 --> 03:06:06,320
He can't keep it out. He's not,
he's not able to keep up this pace.

3255
03:06:06,560 --> 03:06:09,230
So He's already hurting. Cause I
mean he's already tired me. Come on.

3256
03:06:09,870 --> 03:06:11,720
You going back and forth here?
No, no, no. First of all,

3257
03:06:11,721 --> 03:06:15,230
he's not even just got to a minute.
He's not used to sparring, right.

3258
03:06:15,450 --> 03:06:18,800
So everything he's doing is like these
big movements and he's not breathing

3259
03:06:18,801 --> 03:06:21,560
well. So he's all tense and
tight right now to went to,

3260
03:06:21,660 --> 03:06:25,130
could take a deep breath, see all this
is tension for him. He's very tense.

3261
03:06:25,280 --> 03:06:26,420
So now he's got a hold of the leg,

3262
03:06:26,421 --> 03:06:30,320
but he doesn't know what to do and kind
of habit kind of hand fights with them.

3263
03:06:30,960 --> 03:06:33,440
Connor has to do is keep
him moving as he always say,

3264
03:06:33,530 --> 03:06:37,050
punch counter in the stomach. There
we go. And it Kinda is like, oh, okay.

3265
03:06:37,880 --> 03:06:42,110
So Connor's going to keep going to that
and now he's throwing kicks at him and

3266
03:06:42,111 --> 03:06:44,350
the guy's going to kick them
yet I can't put that little bit.

3267
03:06:45,350 --> 03:06:48,260
It'll be too awkward and
Congo kind of trip him,

3268
03:06:48,261 --> 03:06:50,870
throw him to the ground or something
like that. He doesn't know how to kick.

3269
03:06:51,160 --> 03:06:53,420
But kind of just going to keep
punching him in the stomach,

3270
03:06:53,540 --> 03:06:56,760
but eventually just gets
really tired and he gives up.

3271
03:06:57,690 --> 03:07:01,350
But it's kind of crazy to watch, cause
Connor essentially made him fight. See,

3272
03:07:01,560 --> 03:07:05,790
look, he put a gun on his knees just
like that cop guy. That was, that was a,

3273
03:07:05,791 --> 03:07:08,010
that was a bit, yeah.
The victim with the cop.

3274
03:07:08,070 --> 03:07:12,540
He got on his knees and Connor didn't,
didn't allow him either. Consciously,

3275
03:07:12,710 --> 03:07:15,630
Nina, when the body look
at this bro, he's gangster.

3276
03:07:16,380 --> 03:07:19,500
He's kneeing him and punched him
in the body. Geez. I mean those,

3277
03:07:19,501 --> 03:07:21,380
and those are real kicks.
Those were real like neat too.

3278
03:07:21,630 --> 03:07:26,590
That guy is so much bigger than
him. He's a monster. So yeah,

3279
03:07:26,830 --> 03:07:29,490
he's not doing it. And the training,
well that's, I mean he could,

3280
03:07:29,640 --> 03:07:32,310
he wasn't there. I mean he
just doesn't know what to do.

3281
03:07:32,670 --> 03:07:35,960
But if he learned what to do of,
would never do that, that guy's a,

3282
03:07:36,100 --> 03:07:39,000
he's a walking weapon,
like liking gone. Who?

3283
03:07:39,420 --> 03:07:41,610
Franciscan and who was probably one of
the biggest heavyweights in the UFC.

3284
03:07:42,210 --> 03:07:44,520
Conor would never do that with
him. Yeah, he's a train. Yeah.

3285
03:07:44,521 --> 03:07:48,270
He's a trained fighter. Giant striker
who fuck them up. Put that guy.

3286
03:07:48,271 --> 03:07:51,030
That guy didn't know what, who's doing
no, the mountain though. Yeah, he's a,

3287
03:07:51,210 --> 03:07:52,230
uh, he was a basketball player.

3288
03:07:52,260 --> 03:07:54,060
He went to play basketball
and then he broke his, uh,

3289
03:07:54,300 --> 03:07:57,460
his ankle or leg or something
and, and never like heal properly.

3290
03:07:57,470 --> 03:08:00,930
And he just became a, a body builder and
then they put him in game of Thrones.

3291
03:08:00,960 --> 03:08:05,520
Well, he's a world strongest man. Yeah.
He wins those world's strongest man.

3292
03:08:05,810 --> 03:08:09,200
He's not just like a participant. Sorry.
Yeah, he is. Yeah. He's the champs.

3293
03:08:09,660 --> 03:08:12,910
He's crazy strong. It has guys like
magnets for Magnuson. Right? Like this,

3294
03:08:12,920 --> 03:08:16,190
like his mentor, Magnus said his
mentor. Yeah. Magnets for Magnuson.

3295
03:08:16,410 --> 03:08:19,640
What by what a great name.
Perfect name. Magnus for magnet.

3296
03:08:19,770 --> 03:08:24,480
I fucking love that kid. Strong man.
Competent competitor. Magna. Whom?

3297
03:08:24,481 --> 03:08:27,330
Audi magnets for
Magnuson. Yeah, there was,

3298
03:08:27,350 --> 03:08:30,990
I remember we watched those shows used
to be on like ABC Wide World of sports

3299
03:08:30,991 --> 03:08:35,520
and Chin would be on TV. You'd be
watching the strongest man competition.

3300
03:08:35,521 --> 03:08:38,910
They would throw throw barrels over the
fucking bars. I mean they're carrying,

3301
03:08:39,150 --> 03:08:43,800
yeah, like carrying trucks. 18 wheel
semis. Yeah, always ridiculous shit.

3302
03:08:43,980 --> 03:08:45,980
Remember like the guys like they would,
they had, they would lift and they like,

3303
03:08:45,990 --> 03:08:48,860
they had to have like a, a hemorrhage
and it just fucking go through the nose.

3304
03:08:51,450 --> 03:08:53,730
[inaudible] deadlifts.
Yeah. One of the guys,

3305
03:08:53,731 --> 03:08:58,410
Robert Oberst was on my podcast recently.
He's a, he's one of those strong,

3306
03:08:58,470 --> 03:09:00,870
strongest men. Competitors.
They're so big.

3307
03:09:00,871 --> 03:09:05,730
They don't even look like real people.
You're around them like, hi so big.

3308
03:09:06,180 --> 03:09:10,860
There's so big fucking gigantic
humans. The human buddy's incredible.

3309
03:09:11,190 --> 03:09:14,880
It is man. [inaudible] areas. Ah,

3310
03:09:15,810 --> 03:09:18,960
what did he ticking his nose
smelling salt. Isn't that nuts?

3311
03:09:18,990 --> 03:09:22,770
They do smelling salts before they left.
Some dudes drink whiskey or something.

3312
03:09:22,830 --> 03:09:26,970
Yeah, but why smelling salts? You
know, I wouldn't drink the whiskey.

3313
03:09:26,971 --> 03:09:28,470
I feel like that would
make me too relaxed.

3314
03:09:28,520 --> 03:09:32,580
I'd probably shoot myself or something.
Okay. The signs of this fucking human,

3315
03:09:33,140 --> 03:09:37,350
that's what he's four
25 to three [inaudible].

3316
03:09:37,830 --> 03:09:41,670
How much weight is this? It didn't say
this. A ton. Just said is the most proud.

3317
03:09:41,840 --> 03:09:45,390
Look at the ars are God,

3318
03:09:46,050 --> 03:09:48,960
Jesus Christ. Look at
the fucking bar bend.

3319
03:09:54,010 --> 03:09:58,210
Jesus. Good enough to spoken Chai, but
the smelling salts was so strange. Yeah,

3320
03:09:58,211 --> 03:10:01,300
right. Oh, [inaudible] please
do the tool in silence.

3321
03:10:01,330 --> 03:10:05,500
If you did that right before you went
on stage. [inaudible] salts. I might.

3322
03:10:05,950 --> 03:10:08,230
Maybe that's the moon, right?
Maybe we're missing out.

3323
03:10:08,350 --> 03:10:09,880
I think for your next year.
You got to do that shit.

3324
03:10:10,390 --> 03:10:12,730
Just fucking want to pound door
real quick. Can't live a Mussolini.

3325
03:10:14,770 --> 03:10:17,230
I just go up there and just rant
for five hours. Everybody's like,

3326
03:10:17,510 --> 03:10:22,060
shout him out. Did you see Rogan's seven
hour set. Oh my God. Oh, took smelling.

3327
03:10:22,150 --> 03:10:25,920
Oh, brilliant. His nose was bleeding.
Smell like took the best angles.

3328
03:10:26,260 --> 03:10:29,980
Now I don't know how to compare like
a steak bomb or something like that.

3329
03:10:29,981 --> 03:10:34,780
That's like real strong,
strong. I'm like, God,

3330
03:10:35,920 --> 03:10:40,130
it just get out. It pops your brain
like Ludwig. Then you have fucking

3331
03:10:43,300 --> 03:10:46,420
damn. Yeah. You become like Dane Cook
on the side. You'd be like so physical.

3332
03:10:46,540 --> 03:10:51,160
No one's dad physical. No one's
for smelling salts. Physical,

3333
03:10:51,950 --> 03:10:55,150
physical. We should make Jeremiah
walk-ins do it. Oh my goodness.

3334
03:10:55,151 --> 03:10:56,710
He would Watkins on smelling salts.

3335
03:10:57,580 --> 03:11:00,630
He would be the first guy to be have
like what kind of physical comedies you

3336
03:11:00,640 --> 03:11:04,870
have? I like smelling salts.
Physical, the most physical level.

3337
03:11:05,080 --> 03:11:08,260
That cocaine. Yeah, that isn't shit.
You're talking about smelling salt.

3338
03:11:08,261 --> 03:11:11,470
Well who's like, it'd be like Dang
Cook is one of the most physical,

3339
03:11:11,950 --> 03:11:15,850
like Jim Carrey was very
physical. The Williams. Yeah.

3340
03:11:15,851 --> 03:11:20,730
But Jim Carrey would like fall down and
fucking do pratfalls and [inaudible]

3341
03:11:20,820 --> 03:11:23,470
acrobat. Yeah. He couldn't move weird too.

3342
03:11:23,471 --> 03:11:27,100
He had like a real flexibility to the
way he moved and bring like ace Ventura

3343
03:11:27,101 --> 03:11:29,710
pet detective. I mean he that
was on display, right? Yeah.

3344
03:11:29,770 --> 03:11:33,640
I mean that was part of his whole
thing was how wacky he moved, you know,

3345
03:11:33,910 --> 03:11:37,570
nail with a thousand faces. Right.
With then you'd have smelling salts,

3346
03:11:37,571 --> 03:11:41,410
physical next level shit. Just
like those kids in the day.

3347
03:11:41,411 --> 03:11:45,280
They couldn't do the BMX flipped three
times and now they can. They can't. Yeah.

3348
03:11:45,730 --> 03:11:49,060
That's the same thing with
smelling solids. I gotta see this.

3349
03:11:49,061 --> 03:11:51,980
I gotta fucking try this.
Actually ammonia is it? Yeah.

3350
03:11:52,000 --> 03:11:56,230
Just it at a release is ammonia when you
break the thing or when I open the cap

3351
03:11:56,231 --> 03:11:59,610
or whatever. Okay. Oh, that's nothing.
That ain't shit. That's Windex.

3352
03:11:59,640 --> 03:12:03,230
Make it from deer antlers
and hooves. Oh Shit.

3353
03:12:03,240 --> 03:12:07,330
Called spirit of heart shorn. Folks.

3354
03:12:07,360 --> 03:12:11,860
This has been the most educational
experience ever of this podcast,

3355
03:12:11,890 --> 03:12:16,810
I would say, with both real and
false information. We don't know.

3356
03:12:16,811 --> 03:12:18,630
We get aside from which is we've,

3357
03:12:18,660 --> 03:12:23,080
we gave you nonsense and we gave
you truth and we hope you enjoy it.

3358
03:12:23,170 --> 03:12:25,330

Regularly scheduled show at
