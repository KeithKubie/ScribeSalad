00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:01.970
I have a joke about a snail lover.

00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:03.490
He wanted to take it slow?

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:05.180
Yeah, I wrote that.

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:09.940
Hey everybody, this is Matt. You may have seen him before. He does our Facebook video and

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:11.660
and he's gonna help us out here on Youtube today, welcome!

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:12.880
Hi, everybody!

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:15.760
Which is larger, Matt? Your left foot or your right foot? I know you just got here

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:17.220
it's a personal question, we need to know.

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:20.120
Well my left foot is actually half a size larger than my right foot.

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:23.080
That's so weird! My right foot is actually a bit larger than
my left foot

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:24.680
But I’ve gotten used to it.

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:25.689
Yeah, me too.

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:28.539
Lots of animals have body asymmetry, it’s
a completely normal thing.

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:33.640
Even though our bodies are balanced with two
arms and two legs and a usually fairly symmetrical

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:34.640
face…

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.120
Our hearts tend to grow to the left, our stomachs
swoop down from left to right.

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:39.120
Yeah!

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.210
And scientists aren’t really sure why!

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:43.780
But not everyone has a heart on the left and
liver on the right, they can be backwards

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:44.780
-- insidely speaking.

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:48.649
It’s called situs inversus and and it was
first documented in 1788.

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:51.850
Today we know it happens to 1 in 20,000 people.

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:54.199
Everything inside their bodies are the same,
but mirrored!

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:55.199
It’s so weird!

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:56.430
And yet, really interesting.

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.329
So to learn more about it, scientists are
studying Jeremy.

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:02.309
Jeremy’s not a person with situs inversus
though.

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:03.309
Nope.

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:04.300
Jeremy is a snail.

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:07.860
Matt did a whole video over on Seeker’s
facebook page that talks all about Jeremy,

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:09.840
the loneliest left-handed snail.

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:30.000
In humans, doctors have determined exactly when this

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.400
asymmetrical
mirroring happens -- in the womb, when the

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.360
pre-human is still embryonic.

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:39.640
A node, on the midline of the embyro -- inside
that node are cilia which move at a rate “of

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:44.540
about 10 times per second” When researchers
disabled the cilia by editing a gene in mice,

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:46.370
they produced mirrored organs!

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:49.849
Being backwards on the inside does come with
some issues though... congenital heart defects

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:51.209
being the largest.

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:52.500
You’d probably know if you had it.

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:56.569
You know, I talked to Angus Davison, the scientist
studying Jeremy, and he mentioned Enrique

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:58.800
Iglesias has a heart on the opposite side.

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:00.920
He can be my hero, yabab.

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:01.960
Is that baby, backwards?

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:03.239
Yeah, sort of.

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:04.239
Whatever.

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:07.630
