well that's when I said to myself you

00:00:35.759 --> 00:00:35.769
well that's when I said to myself you
 

00:00:35.769 --> 00:00:38.250
well that's when I said to myself you

today I can read that book I can read

today I can read that book I can read
 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:06.149
today I can read that book I can read
from Einstein's unified field theory the

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:06.159
from Einstein's unified field theory the
 

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:08.520

questions about higher dimensions about
 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:13.950
questions about higher dimensions about
time travel about starships and

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:13.960
time travel about starships and
 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.350
time travel about starships and
hyperdrive I can read that book now and

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:16.360
hyperdrive I can read that book now and
 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.320
hyperdrive I can read that book now and
I realized that all the dead ends that

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:19.330
I realized that all the dead ends that
 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:21.600
I realized that all the dead ends that
he was hitting I can see where he

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:21.610
he was hitting I can see where he
 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:23.520
he was hitting I can see where he
stopped where certain avenues were

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:23.530
stopped where certain avenues were

promising but he simply couldn't take it

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:25.210
promising but he simply couldn't take it
 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:27.150
promising but he simply couldn't take it
any farther and the reason why is

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:27.160
any farther and the reason why is
 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:30.360
any farther and the reason why is
because the nuclear force was not known

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:30.370
because the nuclear force was not known
 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:33.540
because the nuclear force was not known
till the 1970s yeah and yet he was

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:33.550
till the 1970s yeah and yet he was
 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:35.100
till the 1970s yeah and yet he was
working on the unified field theory

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:35.110
working on the unified field theory
 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:37.920

starting in the 1920s this was an

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:37.930
starting in the 1920s this was an
 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:40.320
starting in the 1920s this was an
impossible task he was putting together

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:40.330
impossible task he was putting together
 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:42.780

a jigsaw puzzle with one of the big
 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:46.170
a jigsaw puzzle with one of the big
pieces missing and that big piece was

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:46.180
pieces missing and that big piece was
 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:49.080
pieces missing and that big piece was
the nuclear force and so Einstein

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:49.090
the nuclear force and so Einstein
 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:51.899
the nuclear force and so Einstein
understood the electromagnetic force he

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:51.909
understood the electromagnetic force he
 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:53.820
understood the electromagnetic force he
of course pioneered the gravitational

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:53.830
of course pioneered the gravitational
 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:56.640
of course pioneered the gravitational
force but he did not understand the

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:56.650
force but he did not understand the
 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:59.550
force but he did not understand the
nuclear force well today we have a very

00:01:59.550 --> 00:01:59.560
nuclear force well today we have a very
 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.350
nuclear force well today we have a very
good grasp of the nuclear force the

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:01.360
good grasp of the nuclear force the
 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.320
good grasp of the nuclear force the
nuclear forces are mediated by quarks

time travel is possible then the fuel

and time is fabulous you're talking

00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:46.850
and time is fabulous you're talking
 

00:08:46.850 --> 00:08:48.490
and time is fabulous you're talking
about the energy of a black hole the

00:08:48.490 --> 00:08:48.500
about the energy of a black hole the
 

00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:51.310
about the energy of a black hole the
energy of a supernova energy far beyond

perhaps our descendants may be able to

so one day if somebody knocks on your
