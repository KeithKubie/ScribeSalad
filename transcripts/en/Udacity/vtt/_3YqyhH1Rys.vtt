00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:02.370
What do you think is the correct answer, David?

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:05.090
&gt;&gt; So on the left, we have the same two frames we had in the first problem.

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:08.150
So first, I thought that the circle in the middle disappears, so

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:09.940
the triangle should disappear.

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:12.950
But none of these options match that.

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:14.160
So then I went back and looked and

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.710
said, the other way we can think about this is to say the circle on

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:21.790
the outside disappeared but the circle on the inside grew, since their both

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:24.790
circles we can't really tell the difference between those, but once we

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:28.520
know that the correct answer is not just the big square, we can say the only

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:33.040
logical conclusion is to say that the square disappeared, and the triangle grew.

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.730
So the answer has to be three, the big triangle.

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.300
&gt;&gt; That's a correct answer, David.

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.120
But notice something interesting here.

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.648
This is an example of generate and test.

00:00:41.648 --> 00:00:44.430
You initially generated an answer from it and

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.010
then tested it against the choices of a level.

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.140
Yet the test failed, so you rejected a solution.

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:52.010
And you generate another solution.

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:54.630
For that one, the test succeeded, and you accepted it.
