00:00:00.672 --> 00:00:01.831
What I want to do in this video

00:00:01.831 --> 00:00:08.248
is talk a little bit
about traditional IRAs.

00:00:08.248 --> 00:00:12.603
IRA stands for Individual
Retirement Account.

00:00:12.603 --> 00:00:16.003
Individual

00:00:16.003 --> 00:00:20.830
Retirement

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:22.270
Account.

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:25.497
The focus on this video
is the traditional IRA.

00:00:25.497 --> 00:00:28.164
You'll hear of other types of IRAs,

00:00:28.164 --> 00:00:30.671
especially Roth IRA and SEP IRAs.

00:00:30.671 --> 00:00:32.288
This is only on Traditional.

00:00:32.288 --> 00:00:33.537
The just of all of them,

00:00:33.537 --> 00:00:35.871
is really it's the governments way

00:00:35.871 --> 00:00:39.603
of encouraging you to
save for your retirement.

00:00:39.603 --> 00:00:42.288
They all have slightly different details,

00:00:42.288 --> 00:00:45.403
so I'm just going to focus
on the traditional right now.

00:00:45.403 --> 00:00:49.470
Let's say we are in year 0.

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:50.405
That's right now.

00:00:50.405 --> 00:00:53.537
Instead of year 0, let
me write "right now."

00:00:53.537 --> 00:00:55.536
You have 2 options.

00:00:55.536 --> 00:00:59.471
You could take advantage
of the traditional IRA.

00:00:59.471 --> 00:01:02.537
This is the IRA scenario.

00:01:02.537 --> 00:01:07.537
This is the no IRA scenario.

00:01:07.537 --> 00:01:09.622
Now, an IRA allows you

00:01:09.622 --> 00:01:14.072
to put up to a certain
amount of your income aside.

00:01:14.072 --> 00:01:16.536
Depending on your age and what year it is,

00:01:16.536 --> 00:01:18.336
that amount will change.

00:01:18.336 --> 00:01:24.737
In 2010 that number is $5,000

00:01:24.737 --> 00:01:27.137
if you are under the age of 50.

00:01:27.137 --> 00:01:31.536
For under 50.

00:01:31.536 --> 00:01:32.871
It's $6,000 ...

00:01:32.871 --> 00:01:33.804
This is for an individual,

00:01:33.804 --> 00:01:35.203
not for a family.

00:01:35.203 --> 00:01:43.366
It's $6,000 if you're over the age of 50.

00:01:43.366 --> 00:01:45.361
Over age of 50.

00:01:45.361 --> 00:01:47.205
I guess the rational was probably,

00:01:47.205 --> 00:01:48.620
"Gee, if you're over the age of 50,"

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:50.621
"you better save even
more for your retirement,"

00:01:50.621 --> 00:01:53.287
"which might only be 10 or 15 years away."

00:01:53.287 --> 00:01:56.622
They gave a little bit more
lead way for over the age of 50.

00:01:56.622 --> 00:01:58.869
Let's say we're under the age of 50

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:02.205
and we take full advantage of this IRA.

00:02:02.205 --> 00:02:05.288
We set aside $5,000.

00:02:05.288 --> 00:02:07.071
$5,000.

00:02:07.071 --> 00:02:08.870
Here we set aside nothing.

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:13.671
Set aside nothing.

00:02:13.671 --> 00:02:14.872
In the very short term,

00:02:14.872 --> 00:02:18.804
the advantage is that
this $5,000 of our income

00:02:18.804 --> 00:02:21.071
will not be taxed.

00:02:21.071 --> 00:02:24.404
Let's say that my tax bracket ...

00:02:24.404 --> 00:02:27.537
Let's say that I'm in a 32% tax bracket.

00:02:27.537 --> 00:02:30.953
32% tax bracket.

00:02:30.953 --> 00:02:32.288
Let me write that on the side.

00:02:32.288 --> 00:02:34.406
It will apply to both scenarios.

00:02:34.406 --> 00:02:39.871
32% tax bracket today.

00:02:39.871 --> 00:02:42.206
I'm making some good money.

00:02:42.206 --> 00:02:44.287
Tax bracket today.

00:02:44.287 --> 00:02:46.405
On the $5,000 only,

00:02:46.405 --> 00:02:48.405
I'm only talking about
the taxes on the $5,000.

00:02:48.405 --> 00:02:50.005
You're going to have to pay taxes above

00:02:50.005 --> 00:02:51.403
and beyond that on the
rest of your income.

00:02:51.403 --> 00:02:56.004
Today, I'm going to pay
0 taxes on that $5,000.

00:02:56.004 --> 00:03:03.205
0 taxes on the $5,000.

00:03:03.205 --> 00:03:06.938
If I don't set aside
that $5,000 into an IRA,

00:03:06.938 --> 00:03:10.787
then I will have to pay
taxes on that $5,000.

00:03:10.787 --> 00:03:17.871
I'm going to have to pay $5,000 x 32%.

00:03:17.871 --> 00:03:19.804
Which is equal to what?

00:03:19.804 --> 00:03:23.138
I'll just get a calculator out.

00:03:23.138 --> 00:03:32.621
You get 5,000 x .32 = $1,600 in taxes,

00:03:32.621 --> 00:03:42.705
I'm going to pay $1,600 in taxes today.

00:03:42.705 --> 00:03:46.072
In the year that I
actually made that $5,000.

00:03:46.072 --> 00:03:49.774
I can't set aside $5,000
if I made less than $5,000.

00:03:49.774 --> 00:03:52.204
It's always the lower of your income

00:03:52.204 --> 00:03:55.137
or these IRA limits.

00:03:55.137 --> 00:03:57.454
Of course, you're going to
pay, even in this situation.

00:03:57.454 --> 00:03:59.706
Let's say you made $100,000.

00:03:59.706 --> 00:04:01.472
When you put the $5,000 aside,

00:04:01.472 --> 00:04:04.704
you're still going to have
to pay taxes on $95,000.

00:04:04.704 --> 00:04:07.806
In this situation, where you
didn't put the $5,000 aside,

00:04:07.806 --> 00:04:10.455
you're going to have to
pay taxes on $100,000.

00:04:10.455 --> 00:04:13.454
You're going to have to pay
taxes on the extra $5,000,

00:04:13.454 --> 00:04:15.955
which is $1,600.

00:04:15.955 --> 00:04:20.954
Let's say in either
situation, with that $5,000,

00:04:20.954 --> 00:04:25.202
you want to buy and sell some securities

00:04:25.202 --> 00:04:28.864
or some investments.

00:04:28.864 --> 00:04:32.005
Let's say right after you
put in the IRA account â€¦

00:04:32.005 --> 00:04:34.121
Now everything is sitting
in our IRA account.

00:04:34.121 --> 00:04:35.621
All of our transactions are sitting

00:04:35.621 --> 00:04:38.371
in this special IRA account right here,

00:04:38.371 --> 00:04:41.071
where we can actually
buy and sell investments

00:04:41.071 --> 00:04:42.136
and trade them.

00:04:42.136 --> 00:04:44.070
But, we can't cash them in

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:45.405
and turn them into cash

00:04:45.405 --> 00:04:47.870
and then spend it on a new
car or something like that.

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:49.071
If we did do that,

00:04:49.071 --> 00:04:52.373
before the age of 59 1/2, we
would have to pay a penalty.

00:04:52.373 --> 00:04:53.108
Let me write that down.

00:04:53.108 --> 00:04:53.856
You might immediately say,

00:04:53.856 --> 00:04:54.939
"Hey gee, this is a good idea."

00:04:54.939 --> 00:04:57.736
"Why doesn't everyone always do it?"

00:04:57.736 --> 00:05:01.372
The answer is, if I pull
it out before 59 1/2,

00:05:01.372 --> 00:05:03.004
I pay a penalty.

00:05:03.004 --> 00:05:04.005
Let me write this down,

00:05:04.005 --> 00:05:06.070
because that's important to keep in mind.

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:22.672
Pay penalty and taxes if
withdrawn before 59 1/2.

00:05:22.672 --> 00:05:25.705
Once again, this is the Traditional IRA.

00:05:25.705 --> 00:05:27.136
The Roth IRA, for example,

00:05:27.136 --> 00:05:29.004
is a little bit more flexible on the

00:05:29.004 --> 00:05:32.204
actual principle amount that
you put into the account.

00:05:32.204 --> 00:05:33.138
We're just dealing with Traditional.

00:05:33.138 --> 00:05:34.623
This is an important
thing to keep in mind.

00:05:34.623 --> 00:05:37.138
This is kind of the
tradeoff that you're giving.

00:05:37.138 --> 00:05:38.072
The government is saying,

00:05:38.072 --> 00:05:38.737
"Hey, I'm giving you an
incentive to put this aside"

00:05:38.737 --> 00:05:42.738
"and I really want to make
sure that you leave this aside"

00:05:42.738 --> 00:05:44.621
"until you are ready to retire."

00:05:44.621 --> 00:05:46.703
"You don't get tempted, when
you see a nice sports car,"

00:05:46.703 --> 00:05:48.538
"to cash in your IRA and use it,"

00:05:48.538 --> 00:05:51.558
"because you're going to
have to pay a penalty."

00:05:51.558 --> 00:05:53.371
As long as you don't actually withdraw it

00:05:53.371 --> 00:05:54.288
and turn it into cash,

00:05:54.288 --> 00:05:58.371
you can actually buy and sell
securities within that IRA.

00:05:58.371 --> 00:06:01.804
Let's say, as soon as you put that $5,000,

00:06:01.804 --> 00:06:11.737
you buy $5,000 of stock A.

00:06:11.737 --> 00:06:14.372
Here, we don't have $5,000 anymore.

00:06:14.372 --> 00:06:18.005
We only have $3,400 of
our original amount,

00:06:18.005 --> 00:06:26.121
so we buy $3,400 of stock A.

00:06:26.121 --> 00:06:30.826
Let's say, I don't know,
10 years in the future.

00:06:30.826 --> 00:06:33.805
Let's say in 10 years ...

00:06:33.805 --> 00:06:36.024
This is going to be in either situation.

00:06:36.024 --> 00:06:41.602
In 10 years, let's say
that stock A has doubled,

00:06:41.602 --> 00:06:43.013
and you sell it.

00:06:43.013 --> 00:06:44.181
Now, you sell it.

00:06:44.181 --> 00:06:46.602
You have $10,000 here.

00:06:46.602 --> 00:06:52.470
You have $10,000 from sale of A.

00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:53.263
It's doubled.

00:06:53.263 --> 00:06:54.136
Here's it's doubled,

00:06:54.136 --> 00:06:56.597
but you only have $3,400 of stock A.

00:06:56.597 --> 00:07:01.015
Now, that $3,400 is worth $6,800.

00:07:01.015 --> 00:07:08.536
You have $6,800 from sale of A.

00:07:08.536 --> 00:07:12.765
Let's say you want to put
that into another stock.

00:07:12.765 --> 00:07:14.799
Let's say you put that all into stock B.

00:07:14.799 --> 00:07:16.604
I'm painting a very rosy picture.

00:07:16.604 --> 00:07:18.432
You can't always insure
that stocks will double.

00:07:18.432 --> 00:07:21.602
You buy $10,0000 in this situation.

00:07:21.602 --> 00:07:26.347
$10,000 of B.

00:07:26.347 --> 00:07:27.801
I'll hold off there.

00:07:27.801 --> 00:07:29.347
You buy $10,000 of B.

00:07:29.347 --> 00:07:30.136
Here you might say,

00:07:30.136 --> 00:07:32.266
"Oh, I'm going to buy $6,800 of B.

00:07:32.266 --> 00:07:36.932
Because you are not operating
within an IRA account,

00:07:36.932 --> 00:07:40.763
you're going to have to pay
taxes on the capital gains

00:07:40.763 --> 00:07:42.335
from this right here.

00:07:42.335 --> 00:07:46.765
Capital gains are gains made
from capital investments.

00:07:46.765 --> 00:07:50.347
In this case the capital
investment is investing in stocks.

00:07:50.347 --> 00:07:53.347
Since you owned your stock
for more that 1 year,

00:07:53.347 --> 00:07:56.469
you at least will only have to
pay long-term capital gains,

00:07:56.469 --> 00:07:59.847
which tends to be lower than
short-term capital gains.

00:07:59.847 --> 00:08:05.468
In this situation you
made a $3,400 profit.

00:08:05.468 --> 00:08:07.347
Not $340,000.

00:08:07.347 --> 00:08:11.347
You made $3,400 profit.

00:08:11.347 --> 00:08:14.802
You are going to have to
pay 15% capital gains.

00:08:14.802 --> 00:08:19.272
x 15%.

00:08:19.272 --> 00:08:24.097
Let's get the calculator out again.

00:08:24.097 --> 00:08:31.265
3,400 x .15 = $510.

00:08:31.265 --> 00:08:33.603
You're going to have to pay $510.

00:08:33.603 --> 00:08:35.682
This is $510.

00:08:35.682 --> 00:08:37.004
You take your $6,800,

00:08:37.004 --> 00:08:40.137
pay $510 to the IRS.

00:08:40.137 --> 00:08:49.682
You are going to be left with $6,290.

00:08:49.682 --> 00:08:51.535
Remember, the reason why
you have to pay taxes is

00:08:51.535 --> 00:08:53.932
this is not operating inside of an IRA.

00:08:53.932 --> 00:08:55.682
Here you are operating inside of an IRA,

00:08:55.682 --> 00:08:57.735
so you don't have to pay taxes.

00:08:57.735 --> 00:08:59.535
Let's say you invest in stock B

00:08:59.535 --> 00:09:00.932
and then over the next 10 years,

00:09:00.932 --> 00:09:03.070
stock B also doubles.

00:09:03.070 --> 00:09:06.098
Stock ... so this is 10 years.

00:09:06.098 --> 00:09:11.205
Stock B is now worth
$20,000 and you sell it.

00:09:11.205 --> 00:09:16.603
From sell of B.

00:09:16.603 --> 00:09:19.402
Once again, it's sitting
inside of your IRA,

00:09:19.402 --> 00:09:23.265
so you don't have to pay
any capital gains on it.

00:09:23.265 --> 00:09:26.849
In this situation, you use that $6,290

00:09:26.849 --> 00:09:29.202
to also invest in stock B,

00:09:29.202 --> 00:09:34.802
and after 10 years stock B doubles.

00:09:34.802 --> 00:09:35.748
It is now â€¦

00:09:35.748 --> 00:09:36.515
What is that?

00:09:36.515 --> 00:09:40.137
$12,580.

00:09:40.137 --> 00:09:42.469
Once again, it's sitting
outside of your IRA.

00:09:42.469 --> 00:09:45.599
You have to pay 15% capital gains.

00:09:45.599 --> 00:09:49.433
You had a $6,290 gain.

00:09:49.433 --> 00:09:55.349
$6,290 gain x 15%.

00:09:55.349 --> 00:09:57.599
Let's see what that is.

00:09:57.599 --> 00:09:59.131
I'll get the calculator.

00:09:59.131 --> 00:09:59.870
Where's my calculator?

00:09:59.870 --> 00:10:01.871
There is it.

00:10:01.871 --> 00:10:08.469
You have $6,290 x 15%.

00:10:08.469 --> 00:10:10.016
That's equal to 943.

00:10:10.016 --> 00:10:14.017
Let me take that from my 12,580.

00:10:14.017 --> 00:10:23.348
12,580 - 943.5 is equal to ...

00:10:23.348 --> 00:10:26.598
I have $11,636.

00:10:26.598 --> 00:10:33.683
I now have $11,636.

00:10:33.683 --> 00:10:35.181
Let's say 20 years have past.

00:10:35.181 --> 00:10:37.598
We are now over the age of 59 1/2.

00:10:37.598 --> 00:10:42.433
We can now withdraw from our IRA.

00:10:42.433 --> 00:10:45.203
Of course, this situation,
this is cash that we have.

00:10:45.203 --> 00:10:46.468
We can do anything with it.

00:10:46.468 --> 00:10:48.004
Maybe we're now over 60 years old.

00:10:48.004 --> 00:10:49.869
This could be used for our retirement,

00:10:49.869 --> 00:10:51.536
for our everyday expenses.

00:10:51.536 --> 00:10:53.183
This money that was sitting in IRA,

00:10:53.183 --> 00:10:55.849
now that we're over the age of 60,

00:10:55.849 --> 00:10:59.137
we're over 60 now, or over 59 1/2

00:10:59.137 --> 00:11:00.766
if you want to be particular.

00:11:00.766 --> 00:11:02.015
Now that we're over 60

00:11:02.015 --> 00:11:05.469
we can withdraw the IRA
without paying any penalty,

00:11:05.469 --> 00:11:09.008
but we will have to pay taxes.

00:11:09.008 --> 00:11:12.737
We're going to withdraw.

00:11:12.737 --> 00:11:14.099
No penalties.

00:11:14.099 --> 00:11:15.870
We will have to pay taxes,

00:11:15.870 --> 00:11:17.203
but the huge advantage here is,

00:11:17.203 --> 00:11:20.469
once we're over 60, we're
probably earning less money.

00:11:20.469 --> 00:11:22.536
The actual tax bracket that we're in

00:11:22.536 --> 00:11:24.603
is probably going to be lower.

00:11:24.603 --> 00:11:28.349
Let's say we're in a 25% tax bracket.

00:11:28.349 --> 00:11:31.868
Remember, when we first made that $5,000

00:11:31.868 --> 00:11:33.765
we were in a 32% tax bracket,

00:11:33.765 --> 00:11:36.098
because we were this young gun

00:11:36.098 --> 00:11:37.802
at the peak of his or her career,

00:11:37.802 --> 00:11:39.433
making a lot of money.

00:11:39.433 --> 00:11:40.764
Now, we're making less money.

00:11:40.764 --> 00:11:42.470
We're trying to live off of our savings,

00:11:42.470 --> 00:11:45.099
so we have to pay 25% income tax on it.

00:11:45.099 --> 00:11:47.671
If we pay 25% on $20,000 ...

00:11:47.671 --> 00:11:49.349
Remember, now we're
actually withdrawing it.

00:11:49.349 --> 00:11:50.684
We're actually putting it
in our checking account

00:11:50.684 --> 00:11:51.937
so we can spend it for living

00:11:51.937 --> 00:11:54.469
or whatever we want to do with it.

00:11:54.469 --> 00:12:01.357
25% of $20,00 is equal to $5,000 in taxes.

00:12:01.357 --> 00:12:07.805
We will be left with $15,000

00:12:07.805 --> 00:12:11.070
to do anything that we want with it.

00:12:11.070 --> 00:12:11.689
Compare this.

00:12:11.689 --> 00:12:16.022
This is $15,000 verses $11,636.

00:12:16.022 --> 00:12:19.003
Everything that we did
was completely identical,

00:12:19.003 --> 00:12:24.106
except for, over here we took the $5,000

00:12:24.106 --> 00:12:26.071
and invested within an IRA.

00:12:26.071 --> 00:12:28.022
Here, we took the $5,000,

00:12:28.022 --> 00:12:29.939
we had to pay taxes on it.

00:12:29.939 --> 00:12:32.440
Then, we invested it
in the exact same way.

00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:34.938
We actually made very
good stock investments

00:12:34.938 --> 00:12:36.468
in both situations

00:12:36.468 --> 00:12:39.773
and we ended up with a
significant less amount of money.

00:12:39.773 --> 00:12:43.274
This is $15,000 verses $11,000.

00:12:43.274 --> 00:12:44.736
That's almost â€¦ What is that?

00:12:44.736 --> 00:12:45.940
30 something % difference

00:12:45.940 --> 00:12:47.607
in the total amount of money you have.

00:12:47.607 --> 00:12:48.605
Not only that,

00:12:48.605 --> 00:12:51.606
but this tax we had to pay,

00:12:51.606 --> 00:12:53.067
we don't have to pay this â€¦

00:12:53.067 --> 00:12:55.204
this is only in situations
where you have a 25% tax rate.

00:12:55.204 --> 00:12:56.357
When you're retired you might even

00:12:56.357 --> 00:12:58.271
have a lower tax rate than that

00:12:58.271 --> 00:12:59.773
and it's deferred a good bit.

00:12:59.773 --> 00:13:01.689
The real thing to think about is just,

00:13:01.689 --> 00:13:04.669
20 years in the future
you're sitting on $15,000

00:13:04.669 --> 00:13:07.071
verses if you didn't
participate it in the IRA

00:13:07.071 --> 00:13:11.136
you're sitting on only
a little over $11,500.

00:13:11.136 --> 00:13:13.803
Of course, the main trade off here is

00:13:13.803 --> 00:13:16.080
that in the IRA situation,

00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:17.773
you really couldn't touch your money.

00:13:17.773 --> 00:13:18.772
If you had an emergency

00:13:18.772 --> 00:13:20.536
and you had to withdraw the money,

00:13:20.536 --> 00:13:24.000
you would have had to pay penalties on it.
