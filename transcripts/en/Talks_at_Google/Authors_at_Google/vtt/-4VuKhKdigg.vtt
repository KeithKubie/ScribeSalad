00:00:05.772 --> 00:00:09.150
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:10.322
E. FOLEY: I am E. Foley.

00:00:10.322 --> 00:00:11.530
B. COATES: And I'm B. Coates.

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:13.950
But we are also, as
you said, Liz and Beth.

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.650
E. FOLEY: And we're here to talk
about "What Would Boudicca Do,

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.720
Everyday Problems
Solved by History's Most

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:19.851
Remarkable Women."

00:00:19.851 --> 00:00:21.600
B. COATES: It's been
a really amazing year

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.433
for the sort of the
amplification of women's

00:00:23.433 --> 00:00:26.760
voices, particularly in the
UK with this centenary year

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.430
of women's suffrage.

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:30.240
E. FOLEY: And also
as part of that

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.070
there has been lots
of raising awareness

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.230
of the achievements
of women from history

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.700
that have perhaps
in the past been

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.430
kind of let slide a little bit.

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:39.880
And we very much
endorse the theory

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:41.930
if you can see it you can be it.

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:44.670
And so our book is
designed kind of

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.141
to help women deal with problems
that might come up today,

00:00:48.141 --> 00:00:50.640
even though the women themselves
are actually from times far

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.050
back in the past.

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.250
We have chapters on women
from different cultures,

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:55.749
from different
backgrounds, covering

00:00:55.749 --> 00:00:57.070
lots of different disciplines.

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:59.550
So we have sportswomen,
women involved in science,

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.853
in literature, in piracy.

00:01:01.853 --> 00:01:04.019
B. COATES: We know it's a
really noisy conversation,

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.150
this conversation
about women right now,

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.310
but we want to take the
stories one step further

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.920
and see if they could actually
help us in our daily lives.

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.628
E. FOLEY: So the way
our book's organized

00:01:12.628 --> 00:01:14.820
is it's divided into
50 short chapters,

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.910
and each chapter focuses
one particular high achiever

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:20.130
from the past, and
each of them answers

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.270
a very specific problem.

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:22.620
Some of those problems are
serious, and some of them

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:24.453
we're being slightly
more lighthearted with.

00:01:24.453 --> 00:01:27.030
So we have Mae West
on body positivity,

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.730
we have Emily Dickinson
on defying FOMO,

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:31.799
we have Grace Hopper on
facing up to failure.

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.840
B. COATES: And Grainne
O'Malley who is our pirate

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.400
is on work life balance.

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.320
But we're obviously here in
the middle of a working day,

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.010
so we wanted to look at
certain women who might help us

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:47.820
in certain dilemmas that might
come up in the working office

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:48.594
life.

00:01:48.594 --> 00:01:50.010
E. FOLEY: So we
start with someone

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:52.820
who is very famous for
being very good at her job.

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.804
B. COATES: So Elizabeth I is
somebody that I channel daily,

00:01:55.804 --> 00:01:57.720
and particularly at this
exact moment in time,

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:01.110
because we're talking about her
in relation to public speaking.

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:01.770
OK.

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:02.957
So dry mouth.

00:02:02.957 --> 00:02:03.540
E. FOLEY: Yep.

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:04.540
B. COATES: Sweaty palms.

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:05.385
E. FOLEY: Yep.

00:02:05.385 --> 00:02:07.260
B. COATES: Voice all
weird, squeaky and high?

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.280
E. FOLEY: Really trying
to counteract that.

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.446
B. COATES: Well, most of
us approach public speaking

00:02:11.446 --> 00:02:12.760
with a rising sense of dread.

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:13.410
It's true.

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.070
But if we can learn
to fight the fear,

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:17.610
the rewards are very rich.

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.850
And also it's worth just noting
that pretty much all of us

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:23.970
are going to have to do it at
some stage during our lives.

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:27.870
Elizabeth I had a very
tricky start in life.

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.540
She was a toddler when she
was banished from court

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.420
by her father,
Henry VIII, who also

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.870
accused her mother
Anne Boleyn of adultery

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:37.980
and had her beheaded.

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:39.771
E. FOLEY: Just kind of
excellent dad skills

00:02:39.771 --> 00:02:40.690
to start you off with.

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:43.230
B. COATES: But nevertheless
she became queen in 1558

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.249
after her sister died.

00:02:45.249 --> 00:02:47.040
She inherited a country
that was completely

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.230
divided by religious conflict.

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:53.250
So her first job was to
reinstate Protestantism.

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:54.810
And she had to use
all of her sort

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:56.970
of persuasive
interpersonal skills,

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:00.630
and a very stage managed
sense of authority

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:03.210
to achieve what she achieved.

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:05.730
So within one year she'd
got rid of the pope

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:07.350
as the head of the
Church of England,

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:10.360
installing herself,
naturally, in that place.

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:13.020
She'd re-established the
Church of England as well,

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:14.760
and she basically had
taken the decision

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:19.340
not to force her subjects into
religious conformity, which

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:20.730
is what her sister had done.

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:23.760
E. FOLEY: So Mary before her had
done that with a lot of burning

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.440
and murder involved.

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.840
And Elizabeth was clearly
hoping to end up with a better

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.265
epithet than Bloody.

00:03:29.265 --> 00:03:31.250
B. COATES: Bloody Mary
is what she was called.

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:33.120
And so Elizabeth
was wildly clever.

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.690
We know this.

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:37.520
She was fluent in French,
Greek, Italian, Latin.

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:40.830
She enjoyed translating the
classics in her spare time.

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:43.020
She composed sonnets as
well, in her free time.

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:45.090
Basically she was a
massive overachiever.

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:46.590
But even for
someone like her, it

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:48.750
must have been pretty tough
to walk into parliament

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:52.290
and express herself in a room
full of much more politically

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:53.430
savvy men.

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:56.040
And I think what she was
really good at was putting

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.210
on a sort of imperial show.

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:59.280
And this is another
thing that she sort of

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:02.130
harnessed in her working
life, which we can do.

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:05.150
One of her sort of
big hobbies was drama.

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:07.355
So under her there was this
great flowering of sort

00:04:07.355 --> 00:04:08.730
of English
literature, and drama.

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:11.730
Of course Shakespeare
and Spencer,

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:14.130
but also people like Thomas
Kidd and Christopher Marlowe

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:14.670
as well.

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:15.090
E. FOLEY: Yeah.

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:16.050
And that's actually
something that

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:17.640
comes up in lots of
kind of modern guides

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:19.765
to public speaking, is that
watching actors perform

00:04:19.765 --> 00:04:22.386
is a really good way of
honing presentation skills.

00:04:22.386 --> 00:04:24.010
So she was doing that
all the way back.

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:24.720
B. COATES: Yeah.

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:26.400
So obviously her
private life was

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.010
a matter of great
public interest,

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:30.300
and she had many suitors,
and obviously she

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:31.830
was known as the Virgin Queen.

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:34.440
And at one point parliament
got incredibly jumpy

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:37.020
about the succession
of the throne,

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:40.590
and they threatened to take
away her allowance, essentially.

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:43.800
So she used her sort
of rhetorical moxie

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:46.260
in that instance, and she made
one of her great speeches,

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:49.380
and her best cross voice, and
she said at present it is not

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:52.350
convenient, nor never shall
be without some peril unto

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:54.600
you and certain danger unto me.

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:57.780
So she was brilliant at
holding off parliament and also

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:00.360
suitors, but she was also good
at holding off her threats

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:04.410
from abroad, most famously
against the Spanish Armada

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:06.394
in 1588.

00:05:06.394 --> 00:05:08.560
She appeared-- there was
this brilliant moment where

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:13.850
she appeared with the troops
at Tilbury in full regalia.

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:16.340
She had this real
genius for grandstanding

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:17.212
and swashbuckling.

00:05:17.212 --> 00:05:18.920
E. FOLEY: And she
actually, she turned up

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:22.220
in a long white velvet gown
with armor on a gray horse

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:24.250
to make her red hair
look particularly good.

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:26.750
And what she was doing
there was very visibly

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:28.176
channeling Boudicca
from the past.

00:05:28.176 --> 00:05:29.800
And we talk a bit
about Boudicca later.

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:30.650
B. COATES: Yeah.

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:32.870
So Elizabeth was like
the ultimate kind

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:34.080
of motivational speaker.

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:37.710
She placed herself with
her troops to G them up.

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:39.067
And the speech was amazing.

00:05:39.067 --> 00:05:40.400
So she uses this great language.

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:42.230
She says, I know I
have but the body

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:43.730
of a weak and
feeble woman, but I

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:46.760
have the heart and stomach of
a king, and a king of England,

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:47.420
too.

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:49.910
Which is a sort of brilliant
humble brag in some ways.

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:51.830
She's sort of acknowledging
what the troops might've

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:53.730
been thinking, like are
we being led by a woman.

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:55.938
But at the same time, in
the next sentence completely

00:05:55.938 --> 00:05:59.000
subverting it, saying,
I am your leader.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.330
She also knew when to deliver
a bit of emotional sweet talk

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:04.370
in a public way.

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:08.139
Her final farewell to parliament
is known as the golden speech,

00:06:08.139 --> 00:06:10.680
and it basically made them all
cry, which we think is a great

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:11.240
send off.

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:13.160
We're not going
to do that today.

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:17.690
She said to them, though you
have had many princes more

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:19.970
white mighty and wise
sitting in this seat,

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:23.030
yet you have never had any
more careful and loving.

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:24.714
So we think maybe
the next time we're

00:06:24.714 --> 00:06:26.630
trying to do a tricky
presentation to our line

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:29.300
managers, we can
remember the tough crowd

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:31.490
that Elizabeth was facing.

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:33.820
For her, her reign was
known as the Golden Age.

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:35.570
I mean, that might be
too much to pull off

00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:37.319
as your tenure in the
accounts department,

00:06:37.319 --> 00:06:39.570
but hey, it's a good
thing to aim at.

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:40.849
And finally we have some tips.

00:06:40.849 --> 00:06:41.890
E. FOLEY: From Elizabeth.

00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:43.970
So first thing is think
about presentation.

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:47.750
Obviously wear white velvet
at all opportunities.

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:50.910
B. COATES: Alcohol in
small doses does no harm.

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:53.295
And also remember
that worse things do

00:06:53.295 --> 00:06:54.920
happen at sea,
particularly, obviously,

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:56.420
if you are the Spanish Armada.

00:06:56.420 --> 00:06:59.030
And most of the time,
99% of people watching

00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:00.802
are willing you to smash it.

00:07:00.802 --> 00:07:03.260
Or they're just thinking about
their dinner, so either way.

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:03.800
It's not something--

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:05.133
E. FOLEY: We're fine either way.

00:07:05.133 --> 00:07:06.494
B. COATES: Exactly.

00:07:06.494 --> 00:07:08.660
E. FOLEY: So the next person
we wanted to talk about

00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:11.520
is someone who was also very
good at putting on a good show,

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:13.930
and this is 1930s
screen siren Hedy

00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:16.430
Lamarr, who was known in her
day as the most beautiful woman

00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:17.070
in the world.

00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:19.400
And she was so beautiful that
people found it quite difficult

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:21.400
to believe that there was
anything much going on

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:23.692
behind her gorgeous green eyes.

00:07:23.692 --> 00:07:25.400
We talk about her and
knowing your worth,

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:27.050
because we love Hedy.

00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:31.580
She pursued her work passions
in the face of much naysaying

00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:32.607
and resistance.

00:07:32.607 --> 00:07:34.940
And she was an actress, both
an actress and an inventor,

00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:36.650
and the inventor
part of her life

00:07:36.650 --> 00:07:38.690
has had a lot more
coverage recently,

00:07:38.690 --> 00:07:41.630
and she's been celebrated
for that more, although still

00:07:41.630 --> 00:07:43.370
with a lingering
sense of surprise

00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:44.870
that someone who
looks so good could

00:07:44.870 --> 00:07:46.880
be so clever, particularly
if they're a woman.

00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:48.380
B. COATES: Because
we all know women

00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:50.630
are rubbish at science, as
well as fighting, parking,

00:07:50.630 --> 00:07:51.680
and barbecues.

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:54.740
E. FOLEY: So Hedy he was
born in 1913 in Austria,

00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:57.230
and she grew up in a cultivated
and comfortable home,

00:07:57.230 --> 00:07:59.090
and she went to drama
school in Berlin,

00:07:59.090 --> 00:08:01.310
and after that she got
her first big break.

00:08:01.310 --> 00:08:03.920
And it was sort of like a high
brow version of the Kardashian

00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:06.830
sex tape, because she was
involved in a Czech film called

00:08:06.830 --> 00:08:09.830
"Ecstasy," which was the
first widely released film

00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:12.040
to have an explicit
sex scene in it.

00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:15.629
Which it was banned in the US,
it was denounced by the pope,

00:08:15.629 --> 00:08:18.170
her parents went to the premiere
and had a very uncomfortable

00:08:18.170 --> 00:08:20.200
time.

00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:22.310
It's very sweet, actually,
by modern standards,

00:08:22.310 --> 00:08:24.440
although Hedy does run
around starkers in it.

00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:26.867
And there is a famous scene
where she's acting out

00:08:26.867 --> 00:08:29.450
the sexual ecstasy of the title,
which apparently was achieved

00:08:29.450 --> 00:08:32.150
by the director poking her
bum with a pin in order

00:08:32.150 --> 00:08:34.909
to get the desired effect,
which is quite a disturbing way

00:08:34.909 --> 00:08:36.919
to deal with a
teenage colleague,

00:08:36.919 --> 00:08:39.710
but it did launch her on
her celebrity career path.

00:08:39.710 --> 00:08:40.880
B. COATES: She had
something really interesting

00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:43.005
to say about that career
path, where she defined it

00:08:43.005 --> 00:08:45.530
as, she said, the ladder
of success in Hollywood

00:08:45.530 --> 00:08:49.760
is usually a press agent,
actor, director, producer,

00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:51.470
leading man, and
you're a star if you

00:08:51.470 --> 00:08:53.959
sleep with each one of
them in that order, which

00:08:53.959 --> 00:08:56.000
is kind of extraordinary
that she was saying that

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.870
50 years ago and feels very
depressingly familiar to us.

00:08:58.870 --> 00:08:59.510
E. FOLEY: Yes.

00:08:59.510 --> 00:09:02.480
Hedy's new found star light
was quite quickly snuffed out

00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:04.220
by her possessive husband.

00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:06.890
He was a wealthy
fascist arms dealer,

00:09:06.890 --> 00:09:11.250
and he was not keen on people
watching his wife in this film.

00:09:11.250 --> 00:09:13.520
So he rounded up all of
the prints to destroy them.

00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:15.620
And Hedy soon tired of
his controlling ways,

00:09:15.620 --> 00:09:17.550
and she legged it,
one night, apparently,

00:09:17.550 --> 00:09:19.310
according to her story,
dressed as a maid.

00:09:19.310 --> 00:09:22.130
She snuck out of their castle
and ran away to London.

00:09:22.130 --> 00:09:23.960
And whatever the
truth of that, it

00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:26.000
is a good feisty
background story

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:27.710
to give herself to
make herself stand out

00:09:27.710 --> 00:09:29.330
against the other kind
of wannabe starlets

00:09:29.330 --> 00:09:30.950
that she was up
against at that point.

00:09:30.950 --> 00:09:32.325
B. COATES: She
was really good, I

00:09:32.325 --> 00:09:35.360
think, like Elizabeth I at
using storytelling and building

00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:38.930
a narrative to make
you stand out, exactly.

00:09:38.930 --> 00:09:41.600
E. FOLEY: By 1938 she was cast
in her first English language

00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:44.210
film, and from that point
on she found herself mainly

00:09:44.210 --> 00:09:47.522
cast in seductive, exotic kind
of roles, which she became

00:09:47.522 --> 00:09:48.980
a bit bored with
to the point where

00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:51.180
she started her own company
so she could avoid it.

00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:54.320
But in 1949 she went
back into the kind

00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:57.830
of low cut gowns for Cecil B.
DeMille's "Samson and Delilah,"

00:09:57.830 --> 00:09:59.640
which was an enormous hit.

00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:03.130
B. COATES: Yeah, it was a film--
so Groucho Marx said about it,

00:10:03.130 --> 00:10:05.630
I'm not interested in a film
where the man's tits are bigger

00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:09.522
than the woman's, which is kind
of, again, a bit depressing

00:10:09.522 --> 00:10:10.980
thing to say about
the women's role

00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:13.337
on the silver screen in the
golden age of Hollywood.

00:10:13.337 --> 00:10:15.420
E. FOLEY: And Hedy was
certainly not just T&amp;A. She

00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:17.070
had a singular brain
inside her head,

00:10:17.070 --> 00:10:19.470
and when World War
II came, she was

00:10:19.470 --> 00:10:21.990
very keen to be involved
in the war effort.

00:10:21.990 --> 00:10:25.500
And she had, while living
with her ex-husband,

00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:28.314
she'd picked up quite a lot
of knowledge about armaments.

00:10:28.314 --> 00:10:29.730
B. COATES: So
essentially whenever

00:10:29.730 --> 00:10:31.404
the Third Reich
came to dinner, she

00:10:31.404 --> 00:10:33.570
was there just having a
good old listen to what they

00:10:33.570 --> 00:10:34.320
were talking about.

00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:36.653
E. FOLEY: And she teamed up
with a pianist called George

00:10:36.653 --> 00:10:39.810
Antheil, and together they
developed a frequency hopping

00:10:39.810 --> 00:10:41.730
radio device to
help missiles get

00:10:41.730 --> 00:10:44.265
through German defenses,
which they donated to the Navy

00:10:44.265 --> 00:10:46.140
for free, the patent
for free, but it was not

00:10:46.140 --> 00:10:47.490
exploited at that time.

00:10:47.490 --> 00:10:50.070
But I think as most
people know now,

00:10:50.070 --> 00:10:53.250
that technology has become part
of Wi-Fi and GPS and things

00:10:53.250 --> 00:10:55.466
that we use all the time now.

00:10:55.466 --> 00:10:57.090
And Hedy really loved
inventing things.

00:10:57.090 --> 00:10:59.190
It was like her
proper top hobby.

00:10:59.190 --> 00:11:01.150
She applied to the
National Inventors Council,

00:11:01.150 --> 00:11:02.400
but they rebuffed her.

00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:05.400
But she used to when she was on
film sets sit and tinker away.

00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:07.560
She invented new designs
for traffic signals,

00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:12.780
a fluorescent dog collar, a
tissue box, and also an idea

00:11:12.780 --> 00:11:14.880
for a powdered fizzy
drinks cube that you

00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:17.131
could drop into your water
to make yourself Coke.

00:11:17.131 --> 00:11:18.630
But people were
much more interested

00:11:18.630 --> 00:11:21.270
in her six marriages and her
later scandalous behavior,

00:11:21.270 --> 00:11:24.340
which included lawsuits and
extreme plastic surgery,

00:11:24.340 --> 00:11:26.700
and her kind of eccentric
hobby didn't really

00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:30.250
fit with the marketing of her as
a kind of Hollywood sex symbol.

00:11:30.250 --> 00:11:32.066
And so it was not
until she was 84

00:11:32.066 --> 00:11:33.690
that she was recognized
as an inventor,

00:11:33.690 --> 00:11:35.148
and that's when
she and George were

00:11:35.148 --> 00:11:37.744
given pioneer awards from the
Electronic Frontier Foundation

00:11:37.744 --> 00:11:39.660
B. COATES: And she said
brilliantly, well it's

00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:40.850
about time.

00:11:40.850 --> 00:11:42.815
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:42.815 --> 00:11:44.690
E. FOLEY: No one could
rock a center parting,

00:11:44.690 --> 00:11:47.040
a bold lipstick, and an
elegant understanding of spread

00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:49.010
spectrum broadcasts like Hedy.

00:11:49.010 --> 00:11:49.856
Thank you.

00:11:49.856 --> 00:11:52.230
But the important thing we
felt we learned from her story

00:11:52.230 --> 00:11:53.700
was to follow our
own interests, even

00:11:53.700 --> 00:11:54.960
if others can't see the point.

00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:56.400
She was brilliantly
clear on where

00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:57.819
she attributed her own value.

00:11:57.819 --> 00:11:59.610
So she was very proud
of being an inventor.

00:11:59.610 --> 00:12:02.310
But she famously said of the
glitzy bit of her career,

00:12:02.310 --> 00:12:03.570
any girl can be glamorous.

00:12:03.570 --> 00:12:07.150
All you have to do is stand
still and look stupid.

00:12:07.150 --> 00:12:08.990
B. COATES: So next
up we have Odette.

00:12:08.990 --> 00:12:12.510
So Hedy's involvement in the
war was undoubtedly patriotic,

00:12:12.510 --> 00:12:14.100
but it was kind
of at a distance.

00:12:14.100 --> 00:12:17.370
We have some women in our
book whose involvement in war

00:12:17.370 --> 00:12:19.200
was really visceral,
very close up,

00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:20.940
and Odette's one
of the first ones.

00:12:20.940 --> 00:12:23.910
We talk about her in terms
of being open to experience

00:12:23.910 --> 00:12:25.590
and not being afraid
of our mistake.

00:12:25.590 --> 00:12:30.090
So the parallel we
make in the book

00:12:30.090 --> 00:12:31.817
is that feeling when
you press reply,

00:12:31.817 --> 00:12:33.900
you think you've pressed
reply and you've actually

00:12:33.900 --> 00:12:35.275
pressed reply all
and you've sent

00:12:35.275 --> 00:12:37.610
something about your
colleague to the whole floor.

00:12:37.610 --> 00:12:40.540
Well, for Odette, she made
a kind of mistake like that.

00:12:40.540 --> 00:12:42.965
And it changed her life
kind of completely.

00:12:42.965 --> 00:12:44.340
What we wanted to
think about was

00:12:44.340 --> 00:12:46.506
instead of when you send
that email locking yourself

00:12:46.506 --> 00:12:48.011
in the loo and
thinking, oh my God,

00:12:48.011 --> 00:12:50.010
if you could think of a
way to keep your chin up

00:12:50.010 --> 00:12:53.190
and be brave and try and
learn from your mistakes

00:12:53.190 --> 00:12:55.600
rather than be
completely cowed by them.

00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:58.140
Yeah, for her it
had life changing,

00:12:58.140 --> 00:12:59.150
amazing repercussions.

00:12:59.150 --> 00:13:00.900
E. FOLEY: Which is
good news for all of us

00:13:00.900 --> 00:13:03.170
who make that mistake
on a regular basis.

00:13:03.170 --> 00:13:06.270
B. COATES: So she was
born in 1912 in France,

00:13:06.270 --> 00:13:10.675
and her father had been a
decorated hero in World War

00:13:10.675 --> 00:13:13.710
I. He was killed in World
War I, and every Sunday

00:13:13.710 --> 00:13:15.960
her grandfather took
her to his grave

00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:18.990
and said if war comes
again, it's your duty

00:13:18.990 --> 00:13:21.330
to do what your father did.

00:13:21.330 --> 00:13:23.785
E. FOLEY: Which I think today's
child psychologists would

00:13:23.785 --> 00:13:24.910
have a field day with that.

00:13:24.910 --> 00:13:26.430
But Odette was made
of stern stuff.

00:13:26.430 --> 00:13:27.221
B. COATES: She was.

00:13:27.221 --> 00:13:30.120
So then she married a British
guy and she moved to London,

00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:33.630
and then when the Second World
War broke out her husband

00:13:33.630 --> 00:13:36.240
enlisted, and then
the Battle of Britain

00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:38.250
and the blitz kind
of reduced London

00:13:38.250 --> 00:13:39.640
to a real proper war zone.

00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:42.450
So she moved to Somerset
with her mother-in-law

00:13:42.450 --> 00:13:44.164
and by now three small children.

00:13:44.164 --> 00:13:46.080
E. FOLEY: So again, stern
stuff to go and live

00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:47.530
with your mother-in-law
and three small children.

00:13:47.530 --> 00:13:48.980
B. COATES: Yes, absolutely.

00:13:48.980 --> 00:13:53.070
And she was in Somerset when
she heard a BBC broadcast asking

00:13:53.070 --> 00:13:56.770
for holiday photographs
from northern France,

00:13:56.770 --> 00:14:00.616
because the Luftwaffe
controlled French airspace,

00:14:00.616 --> 00:14:02.490
and the Brits were trying
to figure out a way

00:14:02.490 --> 00:14:04.200
to map their bombing raids.

00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:06.900
So she sent this
letter saying that she

00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:08.580
knew the area like
the back of her hand,

00:14:08.580 --> 00:14:09.960
but she misaddressed it.

00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:13.934
She sent it not to
the admiralty which

00:14:13.934 --> 00:14:16.350
is where it should have gone,
but she sent it to the Navy,

00:14:16.350 --> 00:14:19.200
and they then passed it on to
the Army, who then passed it

00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:21.450
to the SOE, the Special
Operations Executive.

00:14:21.450 --> 00:14:23.280
And they immediately
thought this woman

00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:25.410
would make an amazing spy.

00:14:25.410 --> 00:14:28.562
But what they were worried
about is she was a woman.

00:14:28.562 --> 00:14:29.770
She had three small children.

00:14:29.770 --> 00:14:32.442
How would she cope if she
was captured and tortured?

00:14:32.442 --> 00:14:33.900
Again, you know,
they couldn't know

00:14:33.900 --> 00:14:35.855
that she would prove
to be as hard as nails.

00:14:35.855 --> 00:14:37.980
E. FOLEY: And in fact that
three small children can

00:14:37.980 --> 00:14:39.340
prepare you to resist torture.

00:14:39.340 --> 00:14:40.131
B. COATES: Exactly.

00:14:40.131 --> 00:14:41.708
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:41.708 --> 00:14:44.470
E. FOLEY: We both have
three small children.

00:14:44.470 --> 00:14:45.880
B. COATES: So
Odette did agonize,

00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:47.255
but eventually
her sort of horror

00:14:47.255 --> 00:14:49.770
of what was going on in her
beloved home country won out,

00:14:49.770 --> 00:14:52.980
so she began training and she
learned all the good stuff--

00:14:52.980 --> 00:14:55.320
Morse code, how to
handle firearms,

00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:57.460
self-defense, resisting
interrogation.

00:14:57.460 --> 00:15:00.000
E. FOLEY: And her final
report was glowing,

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.700
but it did note a complete
unwillingness to admit that she

00:15:02.700 --> 00:15:05.107
could ever be wrong, which
is a strategy that is worth

00:15:05.107 --> 00:15:07.440
bearing in mind if you ever
are dealing with the fallout

00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:08.505
from emailing an error.

00:15:08.505 --> 00:15:09.130
B. COATES: Yes.

00:15:09.130 --> 00:15:11.540
So Odette was now
Agent S23, and she

00:15:11.540 --> 00:15:13.310
was dropped into
northern France to work

00:15:13.310 --> 00:15:17.720
for a man called Peter
Churchill in a resistance group.

00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:20.360
Very quickly they were betrayed
by somebody inside the group,

00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:22.230
and she was handed
over to the Germans.

00:15:22.230 --> 00:15:25.670
And they got very confused by
this Peter Churchill situation.

00:15:25.670 --> 00:15:28.720
They thought he was a
relative of Winston Churchill,

00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:31.730
and Odette was very happy
to go along with that.

00:15:31.730 --> 00:15:32.960
They tortured her horribly.

00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:34.280
There are descriptions
of what happened to her.

00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:35.613
She had her toenails ripped out.

00:15:35.613 --> 00:15:37.580
She was burnt on her
back with hot irons,

00:15:37.580 --> 00:15:40.500
but she stood completely
firm and didn't squeal.

00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:42.530
So eventually the
Germans sent her

00:15:42.530 --> 00:15:44.840
to Ravensbrook
concentration camp.

00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:48.500
And the commandant there,
again, had heard this story

00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:51.172
about Peter Churchill,
who she claimed

00:15:51.172 --> 00:15:52.880
they were in a
relationship, and the fact

00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:55.100
that he was Winston's
relative, so he thought

00:15:55.100 --> 00:15:57.470
he had kind of hostage
gold on his hands,

00:15:57.470 --> 00:16:00.020
and when the Allied
forces were closing in,

00:16:00.020 --> 00:16:02.240
he took Odette in
his car with the plan

00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:04.940
to hand her over as
a bargaining chip,

00:16:04.940 --> 00:16:07.385
essentially, to the Americans.

00:16:07.385 --> 00:16:10.010
E. FOLEY: That turned out to be
a bad plan from the commandant,

00:16:10.010 --> 00:16:12.260
because Odette
immediately daubed him in,

00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:14.690
and she stole
documents from his car

00:16:14.690 --> 00:16:16.940
and she then later
testified against him.

00:16:16.940 --> 00:16:19.160
B. COATES: And so amazingly
Peter Churchill also

00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:21.640
survived the war, and when
they came back to London,

00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:24.680
Odette divorced her
husband and married Peter.

00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:27.110
So she did get her Mr.
Churchill in the end.

00:16:27.110 --> 00:16:29.690
She was awarded an MBE, and
she was the first person

00:16:29.690 --> 00:16:32.610
to be awarded the George
Cross for gallantry.

00:16:32.610 --> 00:16:35.690
She died in 1995 at
the ripe old age of 82,

00:16:35.690 --> 00:16:38.900
and she's just this brilliant
icon of bravery and resistance

00:16:38.900 --> 00:16:41.120
and all round hard
as nails womanhood,

00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:43.040
and all because of a mistake.

00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:44.690
So I think the lesson
we took from her

00:16:44.690 --> 00:16:47.910
is that if something
goes wrong for you,

00:16:47.910 --> 00:16:49.140
think about your reaction.

00:16:49.140 --> 00:16:52.060
It's also the ability
to deal with a situation

00:16:52.060 --> 00:16:54.500
when there's a massive cock
up, which kind of makes

00:16:54.500 --> 00:16:57.180
us potentially
better human beings.

00:16:57.180 --> 00:16:59.930
And actually aiming for
constant perfection probably

00:16:59.930 --> 00:17:02.910
leads to massive unhappiness.

00:17:02.910 --> 00:17:04.490
E. FOLEY: So we move
from one warrior

00:17:04.490 --> 00:17:07.490
woman to another, our
title lady, many centuries

00:17:07.490 --> 00:17:08.861
before Odette.

00:17:08.861 --> 00:17:10.819
So what happens if the
pursuit of your passion,

00:17:10.819 --> 00:17:12.710
like Hedy, and your
openness to opportunity,

00:17:12.710 --> 00:17:15.260
like Odette, leads you
into conflict with others?

00:17:15.260 --> 00:17:17.660
So women in particular
suffer cultural pressure

00:17:17.660 --> 00:17:19.035
to be agreeable at all times.

00:17:19.035 --> 00:17:20.660
And we talk in our
book about how lucky

00:17:20.660 --> 00:17:22.819
we are to have had women
like Rosalind Franklin,

00:17:22.819 --> 00:17:25.250
like Cleopatra or Coco
Chanel, difficult women

00:17:25.250 --> 00:17:28.100
as they were called,
forging an alternative path.

00:17:28.100 --> 00:17:29.600
But this pressure
does still remain.

00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:32.710
And our next subject is Boudicca
on sticking up for yourself.

00:17:32.710 --> 00:17:35.877
B. COATES: So she's
Norfolk's best known queen.

00:17:35.877 --> 00:17:37.460
She's a woman from
history who totally

00:17:37.460 --> 00:17:41.450
stepped outside of the lane of
what was expected of a lady.

00:17:41.450 --> 00:17:44.720
Her reputation rests
on her unusual levels

00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:48.470
of assertiveness, or what
you might call bloodthirsty

00:17:48.470 --> 00:17:50.360
revenge-fueled aggression.

00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:50.930
Anyway.

00:17:50.930 --> 00:17:53.150
E. FOLEY: So Boudicca's
story's full of holes

00:17:53.150 --> 00:17:55.190
and legendary embellishments,
but it's generally

00:17:55.190 --> 00:17:58.440
agreed that she was the chief of
the Iceni tribe in East Anglia

00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:00.080
about 2,000 years ago.

00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:02.000
After the Romans
invaded Britain,

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:03.650
they made an agreement
with her husband

00:18:03.650 --> 00:18:05.110
that he would be
able to continue

00:18:05.110 --> 00:18:06.860
to govern his own
people, very generously.

00:18:06.860 --> 00:18:09.560
But when he died, that
gentleman's agreement

00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:12.080
did not extend to the ladies,
and they immediately took

00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:14.060
Boudicca's land, and
not content with just

00:18:14.060 --> 00:18:18.510
that, they also publicly flogged
her and raped her children.

00:18:18.510 --> 00:18:23.005
So this is all according
to their historian Tacitus.

00:18:23.005 --> 00:18:24.380
He's the best
source that we have

00:18:24.380 --> 00:18:26.430
for what Boudicca then did.

00:18:26.430 --> 00:18:28.130
So instead of being
cowed by this,

00:18:28.130 --> 00:18:30.380
or accepting the inevitable
sexual violence that

00:18:30.380 --> 00:18:33.260
comes to women in
situations of conflict,

00:18:33.260 --> 00:18:35.250
Boudicca set the world on fire.

00:18:35.250 --> 00:18:36.770
She led a full on
revolt, and she

00:18:36.770 --> 00:18:39.050
burnt the cities of Colchester,
St. Albans, and London

00:18:39.050 --> 00:18:43.070
to the ground, killing almost
all the inhabitants, both Roman

00:18:43.070 --> 00:18:45.110
and Britain, and
she almost managed

00:18:45.110 --> 00:18:47.610
to wipe the Ninth Legion off
the face of the earth, as well.

00:18:47.610 --> 00:18:49.776
B. COATES: There's that
brilliant fact, isn't there,

00:18:49.776 --> 00:18:51.910
that apparently she
literally left her mark.

00:18:51.910 --> 00:18:53.360
So if you dig down
there's a layer

00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:56.150
of red sediment, which
is from her burning.

00:18:56.150 --> 00:18:57.380
Yeah.

00:18:57.380 --> 00:19:01.209
E. FOLEY: So she's the first
in a line of female rulers

00:19:01.209 --> 00:19:02.750
that we talk about
in the book, which

00:19:02.750 --> 00:19:06.090
include Cleopatra, Elizabeth
I, and Catherine the Great.

00:19:06.090 --> 00:19:07.682
And they were
celebrated as anomalies,

00:19:07.682 --> 00:19:09.140
because it was so
unusual for women

00:19:09.140 --> 00:19:10.340
to be in positions of power.

00:19:10.340 --> 00:19:13.070
And Tacitus, as I said, the
most reliable source about her,

00:19:13.070 --> 00:19:15.236
was really obsessed with
how weird it was that there

00:19:15.236 --> 00:19:16.470
was a woman leading an army.

00:19:16.470 --> 00:19:19.525
He elsewhere talks
about all the shrieking

00:19:19.525 --> 00:19:20.900
that there was
because women were

00:19:20.900 --> 00:19:22.525
allowed on the
battlefields in Britain,

00:19:22.525 --> 00:19:23.720
and this horrified him.

00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:25.887
But the Romans were
particularly sensitive to this,

00:19:25.887 --> 00:19:28.220
because they didn't think
that women were logical enough

00:19:28.220 --> 00:19:30.640
to handle high stress
leadership roles,

00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:32.819
and they were very sensitized
to this by Cleopatra.

00:19:32.819 --> 00:19:35.360
Everything that happened with
her kind of sex and death thing

00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:36.960
had really freaked them out.

00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:38.960
But Tacitus was
himself grudgingly

00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:41.960
impressed with how Boudicca
dealt with what he acknowledged

00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:43.480
was extreme dishonor.

00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:44.150
B. COATES: Yeah.

00:19:44.150 --> 00:19:46.940
I mean so, obviously, the
offenses against Boudicca

00:19:46.940 --> 00:19:48.440
are much more
serious than anything

00:19:48.440 --> 00:19:51.050
we might come up against in
our normal working lives,

00:19:51.050 --> 00:19:55.280
and murder and mutilation are
definitely not the response

00:19:55.280 --> 00:19:56.840
to any everyday problem.

00:19:56.840 --> 00:19:59.330
E. FOLEY: But we saw something
in her emphatic response

00:19:59.330 --> 00:20:01.430
that we thought was
inspiring, albeit with less

00:20:01.430 --> 00:20:03.840
disemboweling and mutilation.

00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:05.600
Sometimes extreme
disrespect does

00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:07.360
warrant a noisy counterattack.

00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:09.870
But Boudicca nurtured
a very literal

00:20:09.870 --> 00:20:11.334
take no prisoners attitude.

00:20:11.334 --> 00:20:13.500
But I think she can act as
a source of encouragement

00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:16.054
for those of us who struggle
with expressing dissent.

00:20:16.054 --> 00:20:17.720
She wasn't worried
about making enemies.

00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:19.200
She wasn't worried
about causing a scene.

00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:21.030
She was confident in
her own authority,

00:20:21.030 --> 00:20:23.370
and that meant that other
tribes rallied around her

00:20:23.370 --> 00:20:25.300
when she started her rebellion.

00:20:25.300 --> 00:20:27.240
We can't claim she
had a happy ending.

00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:29.460
The Romans turned out to
be pretty good at fighting.

00:20:29.460 --> 00:20:31.200
B. COATES: As well
as construction,

00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:32.700
aqueducts, the legal system.

00:20:32.700 --> 00:20:33.950
E. FOLEY: Under floor heating.

00:20:33.950 --> 00:20:35.367
B. COATES: That's right.

00:20:35.367 --> 00:20:37.200
E. FOLEY: But the Roman
emperor did actually

00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:39.240
rethink his policy
for colonizing Britain

00:20:39.240 --> 00:20:41.360
and go with a less aggressive
kind of stance on it

00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:44.470
after her revolt, because it
was so significant to them.

00:20:44.470 --> 00:20:47.180
She died by suicide,
Boudicca, to avoid capture.

00:20:47.180 --> 00:20:48.840
And to add insult
to injury, her name

00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:51.460
has been misspelled for quite
a long time as Boudicea,

00:20:51.460 --> 00:20:55.200
and that is apparently
due to a kind of typo

00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:57.510
essentially in one of
Tacitus's manuscripts

00:20:57.510 --> 00:20:59.730
being copied when they
were copied by one person

00:20:59.730 --> 00:21:00.820
to another.

00:21:00.820 --> 00:21:03.420
And legend has it she's buried
between platforms nine and 10

00:21:03.420 --> 00:21:04.440
at King's Cross Station.

00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:06.540
So she's apparently
very near here.

00:21:06.540 --> 00:21:08.527
The ambiguities
in her story mean

00:21:08.527 --> 00:21:10.110
that she's been
repurposed as a symbol

00:21:10.110 --> 00:21:11.699
for many different causes.

00:21:11.699 --> 00:21:13.740
We don't know whether she
was pro or anti empire,

00:21:13.740 --> 00:21:15.781
we don't know whether her
concerns were primarily

00:21:15.781 --> 00:21:17.020
political or domestic.

00:21:17.020 --> 00:21:17.940
Was she a war hero?

00:21:17.940 --> 00:21:19.320
Was she a war criminal?

00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:21.210
What would she
think about Brexit?

00:21:21.210 --> 00:21:24.780
Her reputation lives on because
the UK loves an underdog,

00:21:24.780 --> 00:21:26.340
and also because
she categorically

00:21:26.340 --> 00:21:29.400
refused to be swept aside by
the more powerful forces that

00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:30.990
were in play at her time.

00:21:30.990 --> 00:21:34.040
So sometimes it's the nice thing
to do to be nice and back down.

00:21:34.040 --> 00:21:36.498
But sometimes it's important
to fight for what you believe.

00:21:36.498 --> 00:21:37.790
B. COATES: Absolutely.

00:21:37.790 --> 00:21:43.250
So next up is Sappho, who is
another figure whose reputation

00:21:43.250 --> 00:21:48.900
sustains despite the best
efforts of history to erase it.

00:21:48.900 --> 00:21:52.270
Sappho is someone else who went
her own way, and in our book,

00:21:52.270 --> 00:21:54.170
we talk about her
and backing yourself.

00:21:54.170 --> 00:21:55.890
So when it comes
to criticism, we

00:21:55.890 --> 00:21:58.900
believe there's no one
nastier than ourselves.

00:21:58.900 --> 00:22:00.360
It's very easy to
beat yourself up

00:22:00.360 --> 00:22:02.970
when the meeting doesn't go
to plan or a deal doesn't come

00:22:02.970 --> 00:22:05.130
off, but instead of sort
of throwing ourselves

00:22:05.130 --> 00:22:09.060
down a well of self-hate,
what if there was another way?

00:22:09.060 --> 00:22:12.580
And how do we go about shushing
that belittling inner voice?

00:22:12.580 --> 00:22:15.090
We think Sappho has something
to tell us about accepting

00:22:15.090 --> 00:22:17.100
ourselves, warts and all.

00:22:17.100 --> 00:22:21.730
She was a literary smash in her
own time, an ancient Greek poet

00:22:21.730 --> 00:22:24.300
who had nine volumes of her
work at the very famous library

00:22:24.300 --> 00:22:26.970
of Alexandria, and
the librarians there

00:22:26.970 --> 00:22:29.790
named her as the only
woman in their roster

00:22:29.790 --> 00:22:31.267
of nine prime poets.

00:22:31.267 --> 00:22:33.600
E. FOLEY: And even Plato who
was not a big fan of poetry

00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:35.360
called her the 10th muse.

00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:37.980
B. COATES: But by the Middle
Ages, almost everything of hers

00:22:37.980 --> 00:22:39.090
had disappeared.

00:22:39.090 --> 00:22:41.520
It's partly to do with
the ravages of time.

00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:44.430
So that library of Alexandria
suffered a huge fire

00:22:44.430 --> 00:22:47.000
in which all sorts of original
documentation was lost.

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:48.570
And it's partly to
do with the fact

00:22:48.570 --> 00:22:51.270
that she wrote in a very
particular dialect, which

00:22:51.270 --> 00:22:53.070
by the Middle Ages had died out.

00:22:53.070 --> 00:22:55.800
But blame also has to
lie at the feet of some

00:22:55.800 --> 00:22:57.660
of the clergymen
of the Middle Ages,

00:22:57.660 --> 00:23:01.260
who were totally freaked by
the joyous sexuality that's

00:23:01.260 --> 00:23:02.460
right there in her poems.

00:23:02.460 --> 00:23:04.950
E. FOLEY: One of them called
her a sex crazed whore

00:23:04.950 --> 00:23:06.930
who sings of her own
wantonness, which is not

00:23:06.930 --> 00:23:08.930
what you see on the back
of the Penguin Classics

00:23:08.930 --> 00:23:11.940
edition [INAUDIBLE].

00:23:11.940 --> 00:23:14.970
B. COATES: In the last two
decades, fragments of her poems

00:23:14.970 --> 00:23:17.550
have been rediscovered, and
they revealed whole sections

00:23:17.550 --> 00:23:19.635
of Sappho's rhymes.

00:23:19.635 --> 00:23:21.510
It's very interesting
that people immediately

00:23:21.510 --> 00:23:26.010
knew that this was
Sappho, because she had

00:23:26.010 --> 00:23:27.475
invented the Sapphic stanza.

00:23:27.475 --> 00:23:29.850
E. FOLEY: And you have to be
pretty confident in yourself

00:23:29.850 --> 00:23:32.670
to feel that you need to invent
a new poetic form to express

00:23:32.670 --> 00:23:33.979
your genius.

00:23:33.979 --> 00:23:35.520
B. COATES: So all
aspects of her life

00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:38.220
have been the subject
of feverish speculation

00:23:38.220 --> 00:23:40.192
over the years.

00:23:40.192 --> 00:23:42.150
The truth is we don't
know very much about her.

00:23:42.150 --> 00:23:43.691
We don't know what
her sexuality was,

00:23:43.691 --> 00:23:46.020
we don't know who
her family were,

00:23:46.020 --> 00:23:47.760
but we do know is
that she is associated

00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:49.800
with the liberal
island of Lesbos,

00:23:49.800 --> 00:23:54.330
but because attitudes to
homosexuality in ancient times

00:23:54.330 --> 00:23:57.630
are so different to how we
might consider them now,

00:23:57.630 --> 00:24:00.990
it's very difficult to say
if she was a lesbian or not.

00:24:00.990 --> 00:24:03.750
Ovid, who is a Roman poet
about 500 years later,

00:24:03.750 --> 00:24:05.880
came up with the
theory that she ran

00:24:05.880 --> 00:24:07.890
kind of romantic
finishing schools

00:24:07.890 --> 00:24:10.620
for girls, that she was
teaching them the art of love

00:24:10.620 --> 00:24:12.750
through her poems.

00:24:12.750 --> 00:24:14.790
But what's amazing
is even though we

00:24:14.790 --> 00:24:16.830
know nothing, what we
do have are these poems

00:24:16.830 --> 00:24:19.630
and what sort of sings out
to us across the millennias,

00:24:19.630 --> 00:24:22.350
this incredible voice
and her sort of feelings

00:24:22.350 --> 00:24:25.110
about love and romance.

00:24:25.110 --> 00:24:28.320
And there's a very famous
slightly uninspiringly titled

00:24:28.320 --> 00:24:31.480
poem called "Fragment
31," and the set

00:24:31.480 --> 00:24:35.160
up is she's watching on
jealously as some man flirts

00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:37.230
with this beautiful girl.

00:24:37.230 --> 00:24:40.050
And she talks about-- it's
just an incredible articulation

00:24:40.050 --> 00:24:41.100
of desire and jealousy.

00:24:41.100 --> 00:24:44.550
She talks about her sweating
palms and her ears thrumming,

00:24:44.550 --> 00:24:46.840
her blood kind of
pulsing in her veins.

00:24:46.840 --> 00:24:49.027
And what's amazing
is that she's really

00:24:49.027 --> 00:24:50.610
in touch with her
feelings about love.

00:24:50.610 --> 00:24:53.850
There's no fear of that
emotional vulnerability.

00:24:53.850 --> 00:24:56.502
She sort of owns her weaknesses
and her fallibilities.

00:24:56.502 --> 00:24:58.710
E. FOLEY: And she does the
same in another poem where

00:24:58.710 --> 00:25:00.150
she talks about
aging, and she talks

00:25:00.150 --> 00:25:02.490
about her kind of knackered
knees and her sagging skin,

00:25:02.490 --> 00:25:05.250
and that's not something that
she feels she needs to hide.

00:25:05.250 --> 00:25:06.120
B. COATES: Exactly.

00:25:06.120 --> 00:25:09.120
So we've got some rules
about backing yourself.

00:25:09.120 --> 00:25:12.080
First of all, it's good to
remember that nobody's perfect.

00:25:12.080 --> 00:25:15.110
In fact, imperfection is a trait
shared by all the very best

00:25:15.110 --> 00:25:16.490
people through history.

00:25:16.490 --> 00:25:18.850
We're bound to come up against
other people's judgment,

00:25:18.850 --> 00:25:21.710
just as Sappho's work
did, but you should

00:25:21.710 --> 00:25:23.490
try to stand strong on that.

00:25:23.490 --> 00:25:25.010
And remember, it
doesn't matter what

00:25:25.010 --> 00:25:27.710
you look like as long as your
soul is in really good shape.

00:25:27.710 --> 00:25:31.610
So Sappho had a great line
that says a handsome man guards

00:25:31.610 --> 00:25:32.930
his image a while.

00:25:32.930 --> 00:25:36.510
A good man will one
day take on beauty.

00:25:36.510 --> 00:25:39.382
E. FOLEY: So we're pitching
our book as kind of inspiring

00:25:39.382 --> 00:25:41.840
and hoping that it fills readers
with kind of vim and vigor

00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:43.940
to take on the issues
of the modern world

00:25:43.940 --> 00:25:46.100
with these great role
models, but it did also

00:25:46.100 --> 00:25:48.074
strike us that a book
of 50 really high

00:25:48.074 --> 00:25:50.240
achieving women who changed
the world might actually

00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:52.910
make us feel a bit inadequate,
and our next heroine

00:25:52.910 --> 00:25:55.220
is actually someone who makes
me feel quite inadequate.

00:25:55.220 --> 00:25:57.680
So she is the 18th
century interpreter

00:25:57.680 --> 00:25:59.341
and explorer Sacagawea.

00:25:59.341 --> 00:26:01.340
And there's no way that
I could do what she did,

00:26:01.340 --> 00:26:02.990
which was travel
thousands of miles

00:26:02.990 --> 00:26:05.870
through uncharted territory
with a new baby strapped

00:26:05.870 --> 00:26:07.320
to her back the whole time.

00:26:07.320 --> 00:26:08.490
And I really hate camping.

00:26:08.490 --> 00:26:10.944
So that is clearly out
of my comfort zone.

00:26:10.944 --> 00:26:12.860
But we do think there's
also a broader message

00:26:12.860 --> 00:26:14.240
to be taken from her life.

00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:16.610
So Sacagawea was born--

00:26:16.610 --> 00:26:18.950
she's a Native American
from the Shoshone tribe,

00:26:18.950 --> 00:26:21.710
and she was born
around 1788, and she

00:26:21.710 --> 00:26:23.210
was the daughter
of a chief, but she

00:26:23.210 --> 00:26:26.060
was kidnapped when she was very
young by an enemy tribe called

00:26:26.060 --> 00:26:28.160
the Hidatsa, and
they sold her to be

00:26:28.160 --> 00:26:31.910
essentially the extra wife of
a French Canadian trapper, who

00:26:31.910 --> 00:26:35.090
was the melodious named
Toussaint Charbonneau, who

00:26:35.090 --> 00:26:37.940
had the incommodious reputation
of being a right stinker.

00:26:37.940 --> 00:26:40.100
He was described in
reports of the time

00:26:40.100 --> 00:26:42.140
as a man of no particular
merit, and apparently

00:26:42.140 --> 00:26:43.474
an attempted rapist.

00:26:43.474 --> 00:26:45.890
But of course we have no records
of what Sacagawea thought

00:26:45.890 --> 00:26:49.510
of being married to this guy.

00:26:49.510 --> 00:26:52.610
In 1804, the US
president decided

00:26:52.610 --> 00:26:54.110
that he wanted a
military expedition

00:26:54.110 --> 00:26:57.560
to explore the uncolonized
west of the continent,

00:26:57.560 --> 00:26:59.270
and the leaders
of that expedition

00:26:59.270 --> 00:27:01.475
arrived in Sacagawea's village.

00:27:01.475 --> 00:27:03.815
And they had the grandiose
name the Corps of Discovery.

00:27:03.815 --> 00:27:06.440
B. COATES: I always think that's
funny, the Corps of Discovery.

00:27:06.440 --> 00:27:07.856
They're basically
missing the fact

00:27:07.856 --> 00:27:09.980
that it was not an
undiscovered land for all

00:27:09.980 --> 00:27:11.560
of the native people there.

00:27:11.560 --> 00:27:13.135
E. FOLEY: People
already lived there.

00:27:13.135 --> 00:27:16.190
The corps was led by Captain
Lewis and Lieutenant Clark,

00:27:16.190 --> 00:27:18.524
and they were keen to find
interpreters to help them

00:27:18.524 --> 00:27:20.690
on their journey, particularly
as they were going up

00:27:20.690 --> 00:27:23.690
the Missouri River into
potentially deadly territory.

00:27:23.690 --> 00:27:26.210
And Charbonneau and
Sacagawea between them

00:27:26.210 --> 00:27:28.400
could speak French,
Hidatsa, and Shoshone,

00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:30.620
and so they were employed
by Lewis and Clark

00:27:30.620 --> 00:27:33.650
even though at that point
Sacagawea was heavily pregnant

00:27:33.650 --> 00:27:34.940
with her first child.

00:27:34.940 --> 00:27:38.420
And in fact the expedition
set off just two months

00:27:38.420 --> 00:27:39.751
after she had had her baby.

00:27:39.751 --> 00:27:41.750
So she had a little boy,
Jean Baptiste, and then

00:27:41.750 --> 00:27:42.958
she strapped him to her back.

00:27:42.958 --> 00:27:44.090
She was 17 years old.

00:27:44.090 --> 00:27:47.120
She set off on an all-male
expedition, about 60 men

00:27:47.120 --> 00:27:49.460
and just her, carrying
him on her back,

00:27:49.460 --> 00:27:51.970
traveling all the way to
the Pacific, mainly by boat.

00:27:51.970 --> 00:27:54.950
And it was her survival skills
and her geographical knowledge

00:27:54.950 --> 00:27:56.750
which contributed a
lot to that expedition.

00:27:56.750 --> 00:27:59.000
B. COATES: And there's that
famous story, isn't there,

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:01.850
where she had to jump in, and
her husband capsized the canoe

00:28:01.850 --> 00:28:05.750
at one point, she had to jump
in and rescue their supplies.

00:28:05.750 --> 00:28:07.550
E. FOLEY: So it was a
really tough journey.

00:28:07.550 --> 00:28:09.376
They were kind of
beset by illness.

00:28:09.376 --> 00:28:11.500
There was the threat of
attack from hostile locals.

00:28:11.500 --> 00:28:12.920
There were grizzly bears.

00:28:12.920 --> 00:28:14.880
One man did actually die.

00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:16.880
But Sacagawea made it all
the way to the Pacific

00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:19.470
and then all the way back again.

00:28:19.470 --> 00:28:21.560
This expedition helped
the mapping of the West

00:28:21.560 --> 00:28:23.810
and the eventual expansion
of the United States,

00:28:23.810 --> 00:28:25.670
and she was a key
player in that.

00:28:25.670 --> 00:28:28.310
So sometimes the
constant recalibration

00:28:28.310 --> 00:28:30.740
of work life balance
can feel impossible,

00:28:30.740 --> 00:28:33.890
but I think Sacagawea's story
puts this into perspective.

00:28:33.890 --> 00:28:35.780
Most of us these days
don't get kidnapped,

00:28:35.780 --> 00:28:38.113
get to choose who we marry,
get to choose whether or not

00:28:38.113 --> 00:28:41.120
we want to try and have
kids as a starting point.

00:28:41.120 --> 00:28:44.067
And traveling thousands of
miles with a two-month-old

00:28:44.067 --> 00:28:45.650
on your back certainly
puts the school

00:28:45.650 --> 00:28:47.900
run into perspective for us.

00:28:47.900 --> 00:28:49.340
It's hard to find
a better example

00:28:49.340 --> 00:28:52.160
of an unstoppable heroine to
kind of pep up your spirits

00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:54.280
and make you feel like
anything is possible.

00:28:54.280 --> 00:28:55.196
B. COATES: Absolutely.

00:28:55.196 --> 00:28:57.790
OK, so our next case our next
heroine is in Enheduanna,

00:28:57.790 --> 00:29:00.224
you we talk about
her and creativity.

00:29:00.224 --> 00:29:01.640
So obviously we're
here in Google.

00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:04.280
We don't need to tell you
anything about creativity.

00:29:04.280 --> 00:29:06.470
But what if meetings
and WhatsApp groups

00:29:06.470 --> 00:29:09.200
and the kind of constant
deluge of millions of emails

00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:11.720
is crushing it,
and you can't find

00:29:11.720 --> 00:29:14.160
the time for your
creative juices to flow.

00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:16.940
Well we know that feeding
your inner imagineer

00:29:16.940 --> 00:29:18.230
leads to huge rewards.

00:29:18.230 --> 00:29:20.510
Your jobs are better, you
can ease your relationship

00:29:20.510 --> 00:29:23.120
tensions, it can make you
genuinely feel more alive

00:29:23.120 --> 00:29:24.020
and fulfilled.

00:29:24.020 --> 00:29:28.160
And Enheduanna is an ancient
Mesopotamian priestess

00:29:28.160 --> 00:29:30.000
who took it a step further.

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:31.700
She didn't just revel
in her creativity.

00:29:31.700 --> 00:29:32.720
She owned it.

00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:35.550
E. FOLEY: And she lived around
four and a half millennia ago.

00:29:35.550 --> 00:29:37.656
So she is the most
ancient lady in our book.

00:29:37.656 --> 00:29:39.530
B. COATES: So this is
a bit difficult to say,

00:29:39.530 --> 00:29:40.946
but she was basically
the daughter

00:29:40.946 --> 00:29:43.670
of King Sargon of
Akkhad, who appointed

00:29:43.670 --> 00:29:47.540
her high priestess of the moon
god Nana and the goddess Inanna

00:29:47.540 --> 00:29:51.240
in the holy city of Ur,
which is a bit of a mouthful.

00:29:51.240 --> 00:29:53.010
But that is in southern Iraq.

00:29:53.010 --> 00:29:54.590
So her father the
king was trying

00:29:54.590 --> 00:29:57.950
to unite warring empire
states by putting

00:29:57.950 --> 00:30:01.760
his daughter at the center,
in the holiest role.

00:30:01.760 --> 00:30:04.640
She obviously took her
responsibility seriously,

00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:07.370
and was good at it, because we
know she remained in the job

00:30:07.370 --> 00:30:09.256
for over 40 years.

00:30:09.256 --> 00:30:11.650
And she bagged herself
the claim in that 40

00:30:11.650 --> 00:30:15.045
years of being history's
first recorded writer.

00:30:15.045 --> 00:30:17.700
E. FOLEY: So the first recorded
writer, either man or woman,

00:30:17.700 --> 00:30:18.774
in the planet's history.

00:30:18.774 --> 00:30:21.190
B. COATES: Yeah, which I am
still staggered by, as a fact.

00:30:21.190 --> 00:30:24.579
We know a lot about her
because of her creative legacy.

00:30:24.579 --> 00:30:26.370
There's a body of work
that she left behind

00:30:26.370 --> 00:30:28.980
in the hymns and poems
that she constructed,

00:30:28.980 --> 00:30:31.230
and there's also a
fabulous stone engraving

00:30:31.230 --> 00:30:35.610
called the disk of Enheduanna,
which depicts her taking

00:30:35.610 --> 00:30:36.420
part in a ritual.

00:30:36.420 --> 00:30:38.400
E. FOLEY: And she has a kind
of bald, crouching priest

00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:39.026
at her feet.

00:30:39.026 --> 00:30:40.650
And she has amazing
braids and a turban

00:30:40.650 --> 00:30:43.124
and she's clearly a woman at
the top of her game in that.

00:30:43.124 --> 00:30:43.790
B. COATES: Yeah.

00:30:43.790 --> 00:30:46.730
So the poems and hymns
show us her character,

00:30:46.730 --> 00:30:48.240
and her poems are
kind of amazing

00:30:48.240 --> 00:30:50.690
because they have a
proper narrative arc,

00:30:50.690 --> 00:30:52.479
and this is 4,5000 years ago.

00:30:52.479 --> 00:30:55.020
There's one in particular that
talks about a political threat

00:30:55.020 --> 00:30:59.280
she suffers, and she begs
her goddess for the power

00:30:59.280 --> 00:31:01.560
to wreak her revenge.

00:31:01.560 --> 00:31:03.600
By the end of the
poem she's back

00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:07.170
in her proper position
as the holiest priestess.

00:31:07.170 --> 00:31:09.294
There are loads of amazing
things in this poem.

00:31:09.294 --> 00:31:10.710
E. FOLEY: And we
particularly like

00:31:10.710 --> 00:31:14.734
the line, mistress of heaven
with the great pectoral jewels.

00:31:14.734 --> 00:31:16.150
B. COATES: But
most astonishing is

00:31:16.150 --> 00:31:18.980
her sort of sense of
authorship and ownership.

00:31:18.980 --> 00:31:24.000
Again, she's the first recorded
person to use the first person.

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:27.420
She does it in these lines,
which says I am Enheduanna.

00:31:27.420 --> 00:31:29.960
She says, I've given birth
to this song for you.

00:31:29.960 --> 00:31:31.920
And I love that line,
because it gives

00:31:31.920 --> 00:31:34.470
a sort of feminine kind
of slant to this idea

00:31:34.470 --> 00:31:37.524
of the process of creativity.

00:31:37.524 --> 00:31:38.940
And it's worth
remembering she was

00:31:38.940 --> 00:31:40.898
doing all of this about
a millennium and a half

00:31:40.898 --> 00:31:43.890
before Homer was tackling
"The Iliad" and "The Odyssey."

00:31:43.890 --> 00:31:45.540
So she has, I think,
all the traits

00:31:45.540 --> 00:31:47.670
that we associate with
really creative people.

00:31:47.670 --> 00:31:52.240
She was original, inventive,
passionate, committed, fiery,

00:31:52.240 --> 00:31:53.634
and all of that is doable.

00:31:53.634 --> 00:31:55.050
I suppose the thing
to remember is

00:31:55.050 --> 00:31:57.300
we don't have to all be in
the business of laying down

00:31:57.300 --> 00:31:59.370
art that will
remain for centuries

00:31:59.370 --> 00:32:01.900
to feel like we're
being creative.

00:32:01.900 --> 00:32:04.450
We think it's to do with
everyday creativity,

00:32:04.450 --> 00:32:06.175
and for me that
means just generally

00:32:06.175 --> 00:32:07.800
asking more questions
about everything,

00:32:07.800 --> 00:32:09.174
but it could also
be about trying

00:32:09.174 --> 00:32:12.560
to be just more spontaneous
in your daily life,

00:32:12.560 --> 00:32:16.690
disrupting your everyday
patterns in different ways.

00:32:16.690 --> 00:32:18.330
E. FOLEY: So the
next lesson we have

00:32:18.330 --> 00:32:21.840
comes from what seems like
a slightly unlikely place,

00:32:21.840 --> 00:32:23.940
but covers an issue
that I think haunts

00:32:23.940 --> 00:32:26.010
a lot of people for far
less significant reasons

00:32:26.010 --> 00:32:29.460
than it might have haunted
famous concubine Nell Gwyn,

00:32:29.460 --> 00:32:30.816
had she been that way inclined.

00:32:30.816 --> 00:32:32.190
And what we learned
from Nell was

00:32:32.190 --> 00:32:34.920
how to ride out shame
and embarrassment

00:32:34.920 --> 00:32:37.100
and stop apologizing for
ourselves all the time.

00:32:37.100 --> 00:32:40.480
So Eleanor Gwyn's origins
are not 100% clear,

00:32:40.480 --> 00:32:42.960
but she was thought to
have been born in 1650.

00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:44.340
She grew up in Covent Garden.

00:32:44.340 --> 00:32:46.160
Her mother ran a brothel.

00:32:46.160 --> 00:32:48.930
As a teenager she got
a job selling oranges

00:32:48.930 --> 00:32:51.974
at what is now the Theatre
Royal in Drury Lane.

00:32:51.974 --> 00:32:54.630
And those were very
exciting times in kind

00:32:54.630 --> 00:32:57.090
of theatrical circles,
because the theaters had

00:32:57.090 --> 00:32:59.340
been closed down for 11
years by Oliver Cornwell,

00:32:59.340 --> 00:33:02.010
and the king had just recently
been restored to the throne.

00:33:02.010 --> 00:33:04.059
And as part of
reopening the theaters

00:33:04.059 --> 00:33:06.600
he also allowed women to act on
the stage for the first time,

00:33:06.600 --> 00:33:08.040
because obviously in
Shakespeare's time and around

00:33:08.040 --> 00:33:10.170
that only men could
act on the stage.

00:33:10.170 --> 00:33:12.240
And this opened the
stage door for Nell,

00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:15.120
who became the best
known and most celebrated

00:33:15.120 --> 00:33:17.290
comic actress of her day.

00:33:17.290 --> 00:33:19.980
And she was reviewed by Samuel
Pepys as pretty, witty Nell.

00:33:19.980 --> 00:33:22.230
B. COATES: But then there
was a slightly ruder moment,

00:33:22.230 --> 00:33:24.510
wasn't there, when he called
her a bold, merry slut.

00:33:24.510 --> 00:33:25.093
E. FOLEY: Yes.

00:33:25.093 --> 00:33:28.137
She starred in plays
by the likes of Dryden,

00:33:28.137 --> 00:33:29.970
and she was admired by
people like Aphra Ben

00:33:29.970 --> 00:33:31.290
and the Earl of Rochester.

00:33:31.290 --> 00:33:33.750
And she had three
boyfriends called Charles,

00:33:33.750 --> 00:33:35.310
and the most
significant of these

00:33:35.310 --> 00:33:39.570
was the king, Charles II,
who ensured her lasting fame.

00:33:39.570 --> 00:33:42.090
She met him in 1669,
and by the next year

00:33:42.090 --> 00:33:44.180
she had given
birth to his child.

00:33:44.180 --> 00:33:47.020
And Charles set her up
in a house in Pall Mall.

00:33:47.020 --> 00:33:49.950
And one day he was
there at the house

00:33:49.950 --> 00:33:52.830
visiting her and
the children, and he

00:33:52.830 --> 00:33:55.980
heard Nell call their
oldest son by saying,

00:33:55.980 --> 00:33:57.270
come here, you little bastard.

00:33:57.270 --> 00:34:00.270
And that moved him to formally
acknowledge the boy as his son

00:34:00.270 --> 00:34:01.801
and set him up as
an earl, so Nell

00:34:01.801 --> 00:34:04.050
was quite shrewd in the way
that she handled the king.

00:34:04.050 --> 00:34:06.450
She became one of his
most popular mistresses,

00:34:06.450 --> 00:34:08.400
because she certainly
wasn't the only one.

00:34:08.400 --> 00:34:11.010
Charles had about 14
illegitimate children

00:34:11.010 --> 00:34:13.590
with pretty much about
the same number of women,

00:34:13.590 --> 00:34:16.889
and Nelly became his kind of
bit of rough at this time,

00:34:16.889 --> 00:34:18.630
but he also had a
posher mistress called

00:34:18.630 --> 00:34:20.670
Louise de Keroualle
about the same time,

00:34:20.670 --> 00:34:23.670
and she is now thought probably
to have been a French spy.

00:34:23.670 --> 00:34:25.851
And Nell really
loved winding her up,

00:34:25.851 --> 00:34:27.600
so she used to call
her the weeping willow

00:34:27.600 --> 00:34:29.666
because she was quite
an emotional person.

00:34:29.666 --> 00:34:31.290
B. COATES: But I
think there's evidence

00:34:31.290 --> 00:34:33.206
that they liked hanging
out together, as well.

00:34:33.206 --> 00:34:35.159
They played cards and
ate macaroons together.

00:34:35.159 --> 00:34:36.159
E. FOLEY: They did, yes.

00:34:36.159 --> 00:34:38.199
So it wasn't all handbags.

00:34:38.199 --> 00:34:41.010
So Nell and Charles
kept their romance alive

00:34:41.010 --> 00:34:44.100
until the king's death,
and on his deathbed

00:34:44.100 --> 00:34:46.230
his famous last words
were to ask his brother,

00:34:46.230 --> 00:34:50.409
the soon to be King James II,
not to let poor Nelly starve.

00:34:50.409 --> 00:34:53.730
So James went along with
this, and he set Nelly up

00:34:53.730 --> 00:34:56.660
very comfortably, and
she lived very happily

00:34:56.660 --> 00:34:59.160
until she died quite young of
a stroke when she was just 38,

00:34:59.160 --> 00:35:02.810
and she's buried in St.
Martin of the Fields church.

00:35:02.810 --> 00:35:06.260
So what made her such
an excellent companion?

00:35:06.260 --> 00:35:07.880
It was her shamelessness.

00:35:07.880 --> 00:35:10.250
She didn't care
about going along

00:35:10.250 --> 00:35:12.310
with respectable
feminine ideals,

00:35:12.310 --> 00:35:14.390
and she wasn't ashamed
of the kind of odd role

00:35:14.390 --> 00:35:15.777
that she had in society.

00:35:15.777 --> 00:35:17.360
She seems to have
been a loyal friend.

00:35:17.360 --> 00:35:19.235
She certainly seems to
have had a lot of fun.

00:35:19.235 --> 00:35:21.560
She used to zoom around
in a sedan chair eating

00:35:21.560 --> 00:35:22.970
oysters and macaroons.

00:35:22.970 --> 00:35:26.330
She bought herself a silver
bed with the King's face carved

00:35:26.330 --> 00:35:27.005
in it.

00:35:27.005 --> 00:35:29.710
So she certainly made
the most of her position.

00:35:29.710 --> 00:35:31.340
There was one time
where she was caught

00:35:31.340 --> 00:35:33.680
in an angry crowd
in her carriage,

00:35:33.680 --> 00:35:35.810
and the mob around
her were protesting,

00:35:35.810 --> 00:35:38.240
because they thought that
Louise, who was very unpopular,

00:35:38.240 --> 00:35:41.090
was in the carriage, and so
she leaned out the window

00:35:41.090 --> 00:35:44.060
and shouted I'm the Protestant
whore, because Louise would've

00:35:44.060 --> 00:35:45.000
been the Catholic one.

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:47.660
And the crowd then
dispersed in quite a cheery

00:35:47.660 --> 00:35:50.500
way, because they were
entertained by Nell.

00:35:50.500 --> 00:35:52.400
She was very entertaining.

00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:54.860
So the best lesson
we learned from her

00:35:54.860 --> 00:35:57.342
was not to be so easily
ashamed of setbacks,

00:35:57.342 --> 00:35:59.300
and to put ourselves out
there despite the risk

00:35:59.300 --> 00:36:01.670
of embarrassment, and to
make sure that we take

00:36:01.670 --> 00:36:04.164
time to enjoy the good things
in life, like macaroons.

00:36:04.164 --> 00:36:05.330
B. COATES: Yeah, absolutely.

00:36:05.330 --> 00:36:08.600
So next we move on to
imposter syndrome, which

00:36:08.600 --> 00:36:11.450
we think is the pernicious
underminer of talented people

00:36:11.450 --> 00:36:12.145
everywhere.

00:36:12.145 --> 00:36:14.520
So this is the idea that no
matter how brilliant you are,

00:36:14.520 --> 00:36:16.010
no matter how
professional you are,

00:36:16.010 --> 00:36:18.289
you believe the
compliments are lies

00:36:18.289 --> 00:36:20.330
and you're probably only
one step away from being

00:36:20.330 --> 00:36:22.190
handed your P45.

00:36:22.190 --> 00:36:23.150
So how to deal with it?

00:36:23.150 --> 00:36:26.530
It's difficult, but there's one
historical homemaker, Isabella

00:36:26.530 --> 00:36:29.560
Beeton, who maybe ought to
have felt imposter syndrome,

00:36:29.560 --> 00:36:31.400
but seems to have
laughed in the face of it

00:36:31.400 --> 00:36:32.990
and got on with achieving stuff.

00:36:32.990 --> 00:36:35.030
So what I think of
as Isabella Beeton

00:36:35.030 --> 00:36:36.890
before we came to
research for this book,

00:36:36.890 --> 00:36:40.580
I thought of this
matronly lady stalking

00:36:40.580 --> 00:36:44.990
the halls of some country house
in her crinolines with a dish,

00:36:44.990 --> 00:36:46.460
shouting at the servants.

00:36:46.460 --> 00:36:50.724
But in fact-- and it is true
that her book, her famous book

00:36:50.724 --> 00:36:53.140
of household management does
have some really deadly tips.

00:36:53.140 --> 00:36:56.386
There's one where she says, when
a mistress is an early riser,

00:36:56.386 --> 00:36:58.010
it's almost certain
that her house will

00:36:58.010 --> 00:36:59.540
be orderly and well managed.

00:36:59.540 --> 00:37:02.520
On the contrary, if she remain
in bed till a late hour,

00:37:02.520 --> 00:37:04.660
then the servants are
likely to become sluggards.

00:37:04.660 --> 00:37:06.536
E. FOLEY: We particularly
object to that one.

00:37:06.536 --> 00:37:08.660
B. COATES: But actually,
she was this really young,

00:37:08.660 --> 00:37:10.280
forward thinking entrepreneur.

00:37:10.280 --> 00:37:13.256
She was a translator, she was a
journalist, she was an editor,

00:37:13.256 --> 00:37:14.630
and the brilliant
thing about her

00:37:14.630 --> 00:37:17.090
is that she was really
rubbish at cooking,

00:37:17.090 --> 00:37:18.890
which was a surprise to me.

00:37:18.890 --> 00:37:22.160
She was married to a publisher
and she wrote articles

00:37:22.160 --> 00:37:23.780
for his magazine.

00:37:23.780 --> 00:37:26.090
Her first contributions
were columns on cookery

00:37:26.090 --> 00:37:27.830
and pickling and
preserving, and they

00:37:27.830 --> 00:37:30.230
proved to be a massive hit,
despite the fact that she

00:37:30.230 --> 00:37:31.040
couldn't cook.

00:37:31.040 --> 00:37:32.480
E. FOLEY: Yeah, and she
actually even missed out

00:37:32.480 --> 00:37:34.115
the flour in her
first cake recipe,

00:37:34.115 --> 00:37:35.990
and she had to print an
apology the next week

00:37:35.990 --> 00:37:37.531
because she had
missed out the flour.

00:37:37.531 --> 00:37:39.090
B. COATES: The other
thing about her

00:37:39.090 --> 00:37:41.840
is that she actually
stole most of her recipes.

00:37:41.840 --> 00:37:45.410
So she'd been told by somebody
that culinary expertise took

00:37:45.410 --> 00:37:48.410
decades to kind of gather,
and she decided she didn't

00:37:48.410 --> 00:37:50.070
have time to waste doing that.

00:37:50.070 --> 00:37:51.620
So she just nicked
them, basically,

00:37:51.620 --> 00:37:55.230
and made very good use of the
lax copyright laws at the time.

00:37:55.230 --> 00:37:57.980
But she did bring one
really original thing

00:37:57.980 --> 00:38:00.810
to recipe making, which was
she sort of invented recipes,

00:38:00.810 --> 00:38:01.310
actually.

00:38:01.310 --> 00:38:04.814
So she was the person who
invented writing them in a list

00:38:04.814 --> 00:38:06.230
so that you knew
which ingredients

00:38:06.230 --> 00:38:09.230
you needed to have to hand
before you got on with it.

00:38:09.230 --> 00:38:11.480
E. FOLEY: Yeah, she doesn't
specify measuring them out

00:38:11.480 --> 00:38:13.770
into aspirational ceramics
like on "Bake Off,"

00:38:13.770 --> 00:38:16.061
but we think she would have
approved of that, probably.

00:38:16.061 --> 00:38:17.614
B. COATES: So and
her husband, ever

00:38:17.614 --> 00:38:20.030
the opportunistic publisher,
realized he had hot property,

00:38:20.030 --> 00:38:22.100
and he cooked up the idea
of "Mrs. Beeton's Book

00:38:22.100 --> 00:38:23.330
of Household Management."

00:38:23.330 --> 00:38:25.520
It was a massive bestseller,
and actually it's

00:38:25.520 --> 00:38:28.790
still in print today,
nearly 150 years later.

00:38:28.790 --> 00:38:30.800
What was the genius of
it was it wasn't just

00:38:30.800 --> 00:38:33.140
the sort of 2,000
recipes that it contains.

00:38:33.140 --> 00:38:35.840
It also had tips
on child rearing,

00:38:35.840 --> 00:38:40.730
on boundary property
law, on menu planning.

00:38:40.730 --> 00:38:44.750
So she was teaching this
generation of women around her

00:38:44.750 --> 00:38:46.730
how to manage a household.

00:38:46.730 --> 00:38:49.389
And so after her death--
she died-- again,

00:38:49.389 --> 00:38:51.680
this is a thing I hadn't
realized, she died very young.

00:38:51.680 --> 00:38:53.370
She was 28 when she died.

00:38:53.370 --> 00:38:56.780
And she died after contracting
an infection after the birth

00:38:56.780 --> 00:38:58.350
of her fourth child.

00:38:58.350 --> 00:39:00.200
And basically it was
one of those moments

00:39:00.200 --> 00:39:03.020
where after her death
her fame grew even more.

00:39:03.020 --> 00:39:05.800
And you still find it on
people's cookery shelves today.

00:39:05.800 --> 00:39:07.340
But what I love
about her is she's

00:39:07.340 --> 00:39:10.130
this kind of dynamic
woman who built

00:39:10.130 --> 00:39:13.330
this brand for
domestic goddessness,

00:39:13.330 --> 00:39:15.740
but she was anything
but, really anything but.

00:39:15.740 --> 00:39:18.470
So if you're suffering
from imposter syndrome,

00:39:18.470 --> 00:39:20.960
as I quite often do,
I look to Isabella

00:39:20.960 --> 00:39:24.260
and I think about the way
that she styled it out.

00:39:24.260 --> 00:39:27.320
She sort of understood
that the path to success

00:39:27.320 --> 00:39:30.770
lies in taking risks and not
being afraid of your mistakes,

00:39:30.770 --> 00:39:34.640
and in fact realizing that our
flaws are no barrier to being

00:39:34.640 --> 00:39:36.840
completely amazing.

00:39:36.840 --> 00:39:38.340
E. FOLEY: So this
is our last woman.

00:39:38.340 --> 00:39:40.280
And with Josephine
Baker we've looked

00:39:40.280 --> 00:39:42.270
at the issue of having it all.

00:39:42.270 --> 00:39:44.420
Now, in the media, having
it all is usually used

00:39:44.420 --> 00:39:47.270
as a coded phrase to say
that women can't or shouldn't

00:39:47.270 --> 00:39:48.850
have what men have.

00:39:48.850 --> 00:39:51.440
And as a female, you're usually
expected if you're having it

00:39:51.440 --> 00:39:53.560
all, then that means
you are effortlessly

00:39:53.560 --> 00:39:55.961
combining an Instagrammable
home, a loving

00:39:55.961 --> 00:39:57.710
passionate relationship
with your partner,

00:39:57.710 --> 00:39:59.420
a stimulating and
high powered career,

00:39:59.420 --> 00:40:01.040
and also you look amazing.

00:40:01.040 --> 00:40:05.960
And actually the life of
celebrated dancer and singer

00:40:05.960 --> 00:40:09.400
Josephine Baker actually
does tick all those boxes.

00:40:09.400 --> 00:40:11.640
She sets a very high bar.

00:40:11.640 --> 00:40:13.690
But she certainly didn't
achieve everything

00:40:13.690 --> 00:40:15.304
that she achieved easily.

00:40:15.304 --> 00:40:16.720
It wasn't given
to her on a plate.

00:40:16.720 --> 00:40:19.990
She was born in poverty in St.
Louis in 1906, and as a child

00:40:19.990 --> 00:40:22.210
she had to miss school
in order to go out

00:40:22.210 --> 00:40:24.850
to work so that the family
could pay the bills.

00:40:24.850 --> 00:40:26.410
And she started
dancing on the street

00:40:26.410 --> 00:40:28.380
and in clubs when she
was a young teenager,

00:40:28.380 --> 00:40:30.880
and despite people telling her
that she was too dark and too

00:40:30.880 --> 00:40:32.680
skinny, she got really good.

00:40:32.680 --> 00:40:34.330
She joined a dance troupe.

00:40:34.330 --> 00:40:37.490
Her natural charm and
abilities led her to Broadway.

00:40:37.490 --> 00:40:38.980
And it was from
there that she got

00:40:38.980 --> 00:40:40.810
her really amazing
big break, which

00:40:40.810 --> 00:40:43.210
is that the company that she
worked with when she was 19

00:40:43.210 --> 00:40:45.010
decided to go on tour in Paris.

00:40:45.010 --> 00:40:48.640
And 1920s Paris was fascinated
with the Harlem Renaissance,

00:40:48.640 --> 00:40:50.530
with American jazz
and primitivism,

00:40:50.530 --> 00:40:52.444
and Josephine's
dance number there,

00:40:52.444 --> 00:40:53.860
which was called
the dance savage,

00:40:53.860 --> 00:40:55.690
required her to dance
essentially only

00:40:55.690 --> 00:40:58.570
wearing a feather skirt,
and audiences loved it.

00:40:58.570 --> 00:41:00.910
Obviously this fetishization
of African culture

00:41:00.910 --> 00:41:03.250
feels wrong today, but she
grabbed that opportunity

00:41:03.250 --> 00:41:04.620
that she had.

00:41:04.620 --> 00:41:07.870
And she used to drive
around in a Rolls-Royce

00:41:07.870 --> 00:41:11.650
with her pet cheetah, Chiquita,
wearing lots of diamonds

00:41:11.650 --> 00:41:13.660
and then she went on
to take on the act that

00:41:13.660 --> 00:41:16.114
made her really
truly famous, which

00:41:16.114 --> 00:41:18.280
is a sort of spirited
twerking number where she just

00:41:18.280 --> 00:41:20.974
wears a belt made of
sparkling bananas.

00:41:20.974 --> 00:41:22.390
B. COATES: And
from this point she

00:41:22.390 --> 00:41:23.595
became a complete sensation.

00:41:23.595 --> 00:41:25.720
She was the most highly
paid entertainer in Europe,

00:41:25.720 --> 00:41:28.870
which is no mean feat for
a black American woman.

00:41:28.870 --> 00:41:31.100
She had hundreds of
marriage proposals.

00:41:31.100 --> 00:41:33.974
She was admired by Hemingway,
Picasso, Frida Kahlo, Collette.

00:41:33.974 --> 00:41:35.890
E. FOLEY: And then she
went on to train really

00:41:35.890 --> 00:41:37.570
hard to also become an
accomplished singer,

00:41:37.570 --> 00:41:39.195
and she became the
first woman of color

00:41:39.195 --> 00:41:41.140
in kind of major motion
pictures, as well.

00:41:41.140 --> 00:41:44.110
Sadly, when she returned
on a tour to the US,

00:41:44.110 --> 00:41:46.540
her home country was
not ready to accept

00:41:46.540 --> 00:41:48.850
a beautiful, rich, talented
black woman in this way,

00:41:48.850 --> 00:41:50.650
and she met with
quite racist reviews.

00:41:50.650 --> 00:41:53.860
And so when she came back to
France the next year in 1937,

00:41:53.860 --> 00:41:55.460
she became a French citizen.

00:41:55.460 --> 00:41:58.750
And her devotion to her new
country was really passionate.

00:41:58.750 --> 00:42:01.802
When World War II started, she
worked with the resistance,

00:42:01.802 --> 00:42:03.760
and she actually used to
smuggle secrets around

00:42:03.760 --> 00:42:05.200
in her sheet music
in her underwear,

00:42:05.200 --> 00:42:07.200
because she was able to
travel as an entertainer

00:42:07.200 --> 00:42:09.700
in a particular way that was
helpful to the resistance.

00:42:09.700 --> 00:42:12.220
And after the war she was
presented with many honors

00:42:12.220 --> 00:42:14.644
for her service.

00:42:14.644 --> 00:42:16.810
One of the things I loved
when I was researching her

00:42:16.810 --> 00:42:18.790
is that if you find clips
of her speaking voice

00:42:18.790 --> 00:42:20.581
it's completely heavenly
and extraordinary,

00:42:20.581 --> 00:42:22.181
but there are also
amazing photos

00:42:22.181 --> 00:42:24.430
of her receiving her medals
from the French government

00:42:24.430 --> 00:42:26.620
with her children,
and her children

00:42:26.620 --> 00:42:29.110
were another kind of
key part of her story.

00:42:29.110 --> 00:42:32.350
So after distressing experiences
trying to have a baby,

00:42:32.350 --> 00:42:34.690
she ended up adopting
12 different children

00:42:34.690 --> 00:42:37.210
from different countries,
different races and religions.

00:42:37.210 --> 00:42:39.234
And besides her
wish to be a mother,

00:42:39.234 --> 00:42:40.900
she also had a political
purpose in this

00:42:40.900 --> 00:42:43.510
in that she wanted to build
a rainbow tribe in order

00:42:43.510 --> 00:42:45.430
to prove that people
from diverse backgrounds

00:42:45.430 --> 00:42:46.421
could get along.

00:42:46.421 --> 00:42:47.920
B. COATES: Yes, she
made her chateau

00:42:47.920 --> 00:42:51.310
into a sort of theme park
where people could come and see

00:42:51.310 --> 00:42:53.670
her children and see the
rainbow tribe together,

00:42:53.670 --> 00:42:56.200
which is a good
intention, but must

00:42:56.200 --> 00:42:58.598
have been a very weird
experience to have as a child.

00:42:58.598 --> 00:42:59.556
E. FOLEY: Very strange.

00:42:59.556 --> 00:43:00.056
Yeah.

00:43:00.056 --> 00:43:03.130
But linked to this project of
hers, she also in the '50s,

00:43:03.130 --> 00:43:05.350
became active in the Civil
Rights Movement in the US.

00:43:05.350 --> 00:43:07.930
She refused to play to
segregated audiences in Las

00:43:07.930 --> 00:43:10.960
Vegas, and there was a famous
incident in the Stork Club

00:43:10.960 --> 00:43:12.970
in Manhattan, where they
refused to serve her

00:43:12.970 --> 00:43:15.957
and she kicked off a huge
fuss, and this got her

00:43:15.957 --> 00:43:16.790
in a lot of trouble.

00:43:16.790 --> 00:43:18.498
She was labeled as a
commie troublemaker.

00:43:18.498 --> 00:43:20.684
She was investigated by
the FBI because of it.

00:43:20.684 --> 00:43:22.600
B. COATES: And I suppose
it's that thing that,

00:43:22.600 --> 00:43:25.690
linked to today, it's sort of
depressing that a woman kicking

00:43:25.690 --> 00:43:28.360
up a fuss, speaking her mind
about a perceived injustice

00:43:28.360 --> 00:43:30.340
is still something
that even now we see

00:43:30.340 --> 00:43:32.830
is met with
disproportionate criticism.

00:43:32.830 --> 00:43:35.787
But there was a happy outcome to
the Stork Club incident, which

00:43:35.787 --> 00:43:37.870
is that she formed a lasting
friendship with Grace

00:43:37.870 --> 00:43:40.230
Kelly, who happened to
be there and walked out

00:43:40.230 --> 00:43:41.276
at the same time.

00:43:41.276 --> 00:43:43.150
And that's something we
found again and again

00:43:43.150 --> 00:43:45.190
through our book,
it's these instances

00:43:45.190 --> 00:43:48.130
where women support other
women and good stuff

00:43:48.130 --> 00:43:49.021
comes out of that.

00:43:49.021 --> 00:43:51.520
E. FOLEY: Yeah, because even
later when Josephine actually--

00:43:51.520 --> 00:43:54.700
the cost of running the kind
of amazing chateau theme park

00:43:54.700 --> 00:43:57.250
sent her bankrupt,
Princess Grace gave her

00:43:57.250 --> 00:44:01.230
a house in Monaco so that
she could look after her.

00:44:01.230 --> 00:44:04.570
And then it was only in
1973 that Josephine finally

00:44:04.570 --> 00:44:06.670
got the applause she wanted
from the United States

00:44:06.670 --> 00:44:09.460
when she did a performance
at Carnegie Hall, which was

00:44:09.460 --> 00:44:11.210
kind of rapturously received.

00:44:11.210 --> 00:44:15.550
And not long after that she did
another big grand performance

00:44:15.550 --> 00:44:19.000
in Paris to celebrate the first
anniversary of her dancing

00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:19.570
there.

00:44:19.570 --> 00:44:21.800
And it was only a few
days later that she died.

00:44:21.800 --> 00:44:23.175
And she was found
dead in her bed

00:44:23.175 --> 00:44:25.440
with her amazing reviews
all scattered around her.

00:44:25.440 --> 00:44:28.270
20,000 people lined the
streets for her funeral,

00:44:28.270 --> 00:44:30.400
and she was buried with
full military honors.

00:44:30.400 --> 00:44:33.349
B. COATES: So did she have it
all, though, is the question?

00:44:33.349 --> 00:44:35.140
E. FOLEY: I mean, when
you look at her rags

00:44:35.140 --> 00:44:37.640
to riches tale and her
professional excellence,

00:44:37.640 --> 00:44:40.420
and the lovely pictures of
our cute kids in the castle,

00:44:40.420 --> 00:44:42.490
it looks like it, but
she took a lot of fire

00:44:42.490 --> 00:44:44.770
from people who saw her
as an upstart, people who

00:44:44.770 --> 00:44:46.630
saw her four failed
marriages, thought

00:44:46.630 --> 00:44:49.780
she was a bizarre mother,
a political loose cannon,

00:44:49.780 --> 00:44:51.310
obviously she went bankrupt.

00:44:51.310 --> 00:44:53.890
Now she's recognized as the
unique and powerful performer

00:44:53.890 --> 00:44:56.920
that she is, and as a brave war
hero, civil rights activist,

00:44:56.920 --> 00:44:57.930
and a style icon.

00:44:57.930 --> 00:45:00.180
B. COATES: Yeah, there are
these great pictures of her

00:45:00.180 --> 00:45:01.826
in her huge sunglasses
in late life.

00:45:01.826 --> 00:45:02.760
She's wonderful.

00:45:02.760 --> 00:45:04.260
E. FOLEY: And her
influence endures.

00:45:04.260 --> 00:45:06.489
She's inspired lots of
people, including Beyoncé.

00:45:06.489 --> 00:45:08.280
Most of us would be
immensely proud to have

00:45:08.280 --> 00:45:11.230
anything near the kind of
life that Josephine had.

00:45:11.230 --> 00:45:13.106
But she did work
unbelievably hard to get it,

00:45:13.106 --> 00:45:14.563
and she suffered
a lot of setbacks.

00:45:14.563 --> 00:45:16.110
I'm sure at various
points she didn't

00:45:16.110 --> 00:45:19.105
know that the end result would
be this incredible career.

00:45:19.105 --> 00:45:21.960
So it was very liberating for
us to realize that having it

00:45:21.960 --> 00:45:24.390
all means only going for what
you want on your own terms

00:45:24.390 --> 00:45:26.124
to the best of your
particular abilities,

00:45:26.124 --> 00:45:28.290
and accepting that things
will always keep changing,

00:45:28.290 --> 00:45:31.230
and that is certainly
something that Josephine did.

00:45:31.230 --> 00:45:32.230
B. COATES: So that's it.

00:45:32.230 --> 00:45:34.470
That's our 10, our 10
women from the past

00:45:34.470 --> 00:45:36.390
who we believe can help
our present in really

00:45:36.390 --> 00:45:38.100
tangible, concrete ways.

00:45:38.100 --> 00:45:41.850
We have there a queen, an
inventor, a spy, a warrior,

00:45:41.850 --> 00:45:45.450
a poet, an explorer, a
priestess, a concubine, a cook,

00:45:45.450 --> 00:45:46.660
and a dancer--

00:45:46.660 --> 00:45:49.590
all much more exciting jobs
than most of us can have.

00:45:49.590 --> 00:45:51.405
But all these women
excelled at what

00:45:51.405 --> 00:45:53.280
they put their energies
into, and all of them

00:45:53.280 --> 00:45:54.300
left their mark.

00:45:54.300 --> 00:45:56.880
And they certainly raised
our sense of what's possible,

00:45:56.880 --> 00:45:58.530
and they raised our
spirits as well.

00:45:58.530 --> 00:46:00.480
E. FOLEY: We had a really
joyful time writing the book

00:46:00.480 --> 00:46:02.520
and working with the
illustrator, Bijou Karman,

00:46:02.520 --> 00:46:05.200
whose work you've
seen behind us today.

00:46:05.200 --> 00:46:08.640
And we hope that you and perhaps
aunties, sisters, you know,

00:46:08.640 --> 00:46:11.730
daughters enjoy it, and it
gives you an amusing few hours

00:46:11.730 --> 00:46:13.395
and solves all of your problems.

00:46:13.395 --> 00:46:15.186
B. COATES: Thank you
so much for having us.

00:46:15.186 --> 00:46:15.686
Thank you.

00:46:15.686 --> 00:46:19.560
[APPLAUSE]

00:46:21.990 --> 00:46:23.810
SPEAKER: So we have
time for some questions

00:46:23.810 --> 00:46:25.960
if anyone has any.

00:46:25.960 --> 00:46:28.820
AUDIENCE: How did you
go about your research

00:46:28.820 --> 00:46:31.060
and deciding who
would be in the book?

00:46:31.060 --> 00:46:33.740
B. COATES: Yeah, so the decision
making was one of the hardest

00:46:33.740 --> 00:46:35.780
but also one of the
most fun bits of it.

00:46:35.780 --> 00:46:39.950
We actually have a list
of about 290 other women,

00:46:39.950 --> 00:46:41.750
and it's called spare ladies.

00:46:41.750 --> 00:46:43.259
It's a document that we have.

00:46:43.259 --> 00:46:45.800
E. FOLEY: Turns out women have
been doing really great things

00:46:45.800 --> 00:46:47.060
for a really long time.

00:46:47.060 --> 00:46:50.510
B. COATES: So we came up with
a list of modern dilemmas

00:46:50.510 --> 00:46:52.612
that we thought were
worth answering,

00:46:52.612 --> 00:46:54.320
and then we came up
with a list of women,

00:46:54.320 --> 00:46:56.361
and we were really clear
that we wanted the women

00:46:56.361 --> 00:46:59.510
to be representative of all
different countries, but also

00:46:59.510 --> 00:47:00.810
different disciplines.

00:47:00.810 --> 00:47:04.110
So we both work in the
publishing industry,

00:47:04.110 --> 00:47:05.960
so our natural instinct
was to go with lots

00:47:05.960 --> 00:47:07.400
of writers and artists.

00:47:07.400 --> 00:47:09.200
But in fact, we wanted
scientists in there

00:47:09.200 --> 00:47:13.250
and explorers and sportswomen
and all those other facets.

00:47:13.250 --> 00:47:16.700
And then just a quick
look at a woman's life

00:47:16.700 --> 00:47:19.340
and you'd immediately
see the little point that

00:47:19.340 --> 00:47:22.340
answered the modern dilemma, and
that was the springboard for us

00:47:22.340 --> 00:47:24.450
to then go off and
research them more fully.

00:47:24.450 --> 00:47:28.070
So there's definitely people
we regret leaving out.

00:47:28.070 --> 00:47:29.870
Marie Curie's not in there.

00:47:29.870 --> 00:47:31.090
Maya Angelou.

00:47:31.090 --> 00:47:32.300
I feel bad about her.

00:47:32.300 --> 00:47:33.600
E. FOLEY: You feel bad
about Mary, Queen of Scots.

00:47:33.600 --> 00:47:35.933
B. COATES: I do you feel bad
about Mary, Queen of Scots.

00:47:35.933 --> 00:47:39.680
But yeah, maybe for volume two.

00:47:39.680 --> 00:47:42.320
AUDIENCE: What inspired
you on this subject?

00:47:42.320 --> 00:47:45.570
I was going to ask what do you
do, but you work in publishing,

00:47:45.570 --> 00:47:48.210
but why did you
pick this subject?

00:47:48.210 --> 00:47:52.400
B. COATES: So it genuinely
came from watching

00:47:52.400 --> 00:47:56.070
the women's marches post
the election in America.

00:47:56.070 --> 00:47:58.160
We were really inspired
by all those placards

00:47:58.160 --> 00:48:01.370
about nasty women,
and the way that women

00:48:01.370 --> 00:48:07.520
were kind of reclaiming it from
an insult into a positive term.

00:48:07.520 --> 00:48:10.790
So we originally thought of it
as a book celebrating the kind

00:48:10.790 --> 00:48:11.934
of nasty women of the past.

00:48:11.934 --> 00:48:13.350
And a lot of the
women in our book

00:48:13.350 --> 00:48:14.766
are sort of difficult
and complex,

00:48:14.766 --> 00:48:18.050
and that was something else
we wanted to highlight.

00:48:18.050 --> 00:48:19.830
They're not perfect,
any of these women.

00:48:19.830 --> 00:48:21.126
They're sort of bad mothers.

00:48:21.126 --> 00:48:22.250
E. FOLEY: Yeah, alcoholics.

00:48:22.250 --> 00:48:23.210
Bad girlfriends.

00:48:23.210 --> 00:48:24.170
B. COATES: Exactly.

00:48:24.170 --> 00:48:27.980
And we really wanted to
show that these aren't

00:48:27.980 --> 00:48:29.930
kind of bastions of perfection.

00:48:29.930 --> 00:48:31.430
But then we also,
as we said, wanted

00:48:31.430 --> 00:48:32.804
to take it a step
further and see

00:48:32.804 --> 00:48:35.330
is there a way that
these amazing nasty women

00:48:35.330 --> 00:48:37.445
from the past can help
us with modern dilemmas.

00:48:37.445 --> 00:48:41.520
So that was where it came from.

00:48:41.520 --> 00:48:43.550
AUDIENCE: Do you
have a favorite?

00:48:43.550 --> 00:48:45.840
E. FOLEY: Yeah, Josephine's
one of my favorites.

00:48:45.840 --> 00:48:48.530
B. COATES: And I think
Isabella Beeton is one of mine.

00:48:48.530 --> 00:48:50.975
But I do love Sappho, as well.

00:48:50.975 --> 00:48:53.600
You can't-- it was a very joyful
experience to write this book,

00:48:53.600 --> 00:48:54.821
and they all were genuinely--

00:48:54.821 --> 00:48:56.820
E. FOLEY: Mae West is
really good too, actually.

00:48:56.820 --> 00:48:58.114
B. COATES: Yeah, she's great.

00:48:58.114 --> 00:48:59.530
And Frida Kahlo's
amazing as well.

00:48:59.530 --> 00:49:02.540
E. FOLEY: That's the thing, Once
we start it's very difficult.

00:49:02.540 --> 00:49:04.039
AUDIENCE: Do you
get quoted on that?

00:49:06.020 --> 00:49:08.520
AUDIENCE: There's a children's
book you might have heard of,

00:49:08.520 --> 00:49:09.830
"Good Night Stories
for Rebel Girls"

00:49:09.830 --> 00:49:11.746
which is doing sort of
a fairly similar thing.

00:49:11.746 --> 00:49:15.102
What do you think is different
about what you're going for?

00:49:15.102 --> 00:49:16.810
E. FOLEY: So yeah, I
think the main thing

00:49:16.810 --> 00:49:19.257
is that ours is for a
kind of an older audience.

00:49:19.257 --> 00:49:20.590
So we have swearing in our book.

00:49:20.590 --> 00:49:21.360
And I love--

00:49:21.360 --> 00:49:23.220
"Good Night Stories"
is a brilliant book,

00:49:23.220 --> 00:49:25.720
and my children read it, and
your children read it at night,

00:49:25.720 --> 00:49:28.450
but the premise of that is to
present these women's stories

00:49:28.450 --> 00:49:29.460
as fairy tales.

00:49:29.460 --> 00:49:30.996
And in a way, what
we wanted to do

00:49:30.996 --> 00:49:33.370
was quite different to that
in that we are depicting them

00:49:33.370 --> 00:49:37.000
warts and all, and we are
looking at adult problems

00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:38.302
in relation to their lives.

00:49:38.302 --> 00:49:40.510
So I mean that book is a
gorgeous and wonderful book,

00:49:40.510 --> 00:49:41.980
and we sort of
hope this is a kind

00:49:41.980 --> 00:49:43.410
of slightly older sister to it.

00:49:43.410 --> 00:49:45.220
B. COATES: Yeah, that's
a good way of putting it.

00:49:45.220 --> 00:49:47.386
But yeah, we have some
really difficult women in it.

00:49:47.386 --> 00:49:50.830
So Coco Chanel, who I think is
also in "Good Night Stories,"

00:49:50.830 --> 00:49:52.450
and what they
don't talk about is

00:49:52.450 --> 00:49:54.704
her sort of Nazi
sympathizing past

00:49:54.704 --> 00:49:55.870
as well, because obviously--

00:49:55.870 --> 00:49:57.240
E. FOLEY: It's for children.

00:49:57.240 --> 00:49:59.198
B. COATES: But we do
confront that in the book.

00:49:59.198 --> 00:50:02.040
And then another figure who
we really hemmed and hawed

00:50:02.040 --> 00:50:05.980
over putting in there was
Marie Stopes, because she

00:50:05.980 --> 00:50:08.980
held some really dodgy kind
of world views at the time.

00:50:08.980 --> 00:50:10.910
But again, that was
really intentional.

00:50:10.910 --> 00:50:12.409
We thought long and
hard about that.

00:50:12.409 --> 00:50:14.530
We wanted difficult
women in there as well.

00:50:14.530 --> 00:50:17.780
We didn't want to sugar coat it.

00:50:17.780 --> 00:50:20.330
AUDIENCE: I'm just curious,
what is the most poignant lesson

00:50:20.330 --> 00:50:23.120
that you each have
taken away from all

00:50:23.120 --> 00:50:26.870
the various chapter problems?

00:50:26.870 --> 00:50:28.880
E. FOLEY: I mean, I
think for me it really

00:50:28.880 --> 00:50:30.800
is this idea of women
helping other women,

00:50:30.800 --> 00:50:32.810
because that's something that we
had-- and actually to be fair,

00:50:32.810 --> 00:50:34.550
also there are
lots of great dads

00:50:34.550 --> 00:50:36.410
and brothers and
husbands in this book who

00:50:36.410 --> 00:50:38.660
are really instrumental
in allowing these women,

00:50:38.660 --> 00:50:40.310
or helping these women
achieve what they achieved.

00:50:40.310 --> 00:50:41.450
B. COATES: Yeah,
there's a lot of fathers

00:50:41.450 --> 00:50:44.300
who refused to accept that
their daughters couldn't have

00:50:44.300 --> 00:50:48.140
a decent education, so they
would educate them privately

00:50:48.140 --> 00:50:51.320
or find other ways to kind
of instill education in them.

00:50:51.320 --> 00:50:52.820
And that was very
moving, wasn't it?

00:50:52.820 --> 00:50:53.980
E. FOLEY: It was.

00:50:53.980 --> 00:50:55.820
That they had to
step outside of what

00:50:55.820 --> 00:50:58.130
was supposed to be
allowed for girls,

00:50:58.130 --> 00:50:59.930
and the father
supported them in that.

00:50:59.930 --> 00:51:02.530
But we have-- so the Princess
Grace and Josephine one's

00:51:02.530 --> 00:51:05.540
something that we love, but also
when we talk about the tennis

00:51:05.540 --> 00:51:07.422
player Althea
Gibson, and she has

00:51:07.422 --> 00:51:09.005
an amazing kind of
mentor relationship

00:51:09.005 --> 00:51:09.350
with women who had helped her.

00:51:09.350 --> 00:51:11.630
B. COATES: So she was
like the first black woman

00:51:11.630 --> 00:51:13.884
to win Wimbledon in
the '50s, and just it

00:51:13.884 --> 00:51:16.550
was really moving that there are
certain moments during her life

00:51:16.550 --> 00:51:19.370
where just women swooped
in and really helped her.

00:51:19.370 --> 00:51:22.280
So one of the white
champions at the time

00:51:22.280 --> 00:51:25.310
wrote this open letter to a
magazine to say come on guys,

00:51:25.310 --> 00:51:28.890
why don't we let her into
the Lawn Tennis Association?

00:51:28.890 --> 00:51:30.230
And that was a great moment.

00:51:30.230 --> 00:51:31.850
And then later in
her life when she'd

00:51:31.850 --> 00:51:34.790
sort of fallen afoul of the
American health care system,

00:51:34.790 --> 00:51:37.715
again, another woman swooped
in and raised a load of money

00:51:37.715 --> 00:51:38.840
to pay for her health care.

00:51:38.840 --> 00:51:41.150
So that was really
moving, that sense

00:51:41.150 --> 00:51:43.694
of women helping each other.

00:51:43.694 --> 00:51:45.110
AUDIENCE: You say
that you're very

00:51:45.110 --> 00:51:48.350
intentional in distributing
through different regions,

00:51:48.350 --> 00:51:50.240
times in history,
but you also say

00:51:50.240 --> 00:51:53.180
that you have 290 spare women.

00:51:53.180 --> 00:51:56.870
Is there any particular
time in history or region

00:51:56.870 --> 00:52:02.340
that stands out for having a
lot of women in that period?

00:52:02.340 --> 00:52:05.270
B. COATES: I mean, I think
what we tried not to do,

00:52:05.270 --> 00:52:07.615
because ultimately
what you do end up

00:52:07.615 --> 00:52:08.990
with when you look
at these lists

00:52:08.990 --> 00:52:10.937
is quite a lot of
Victorian white women.

00:52:10.937 --> 00:52:12.770
E. FOLEY: Yes, that's
where the records are.

00:52:12.770 --> 00:52:14.436
B. COATES: That's
where the records are.

00:52:14.436 --> 00:52:16.010
That seems to be
where women suddenly

00:52:16.010 --> 00:52:17.020
did start to change the world.

00:52:17.020 --> 00:52:18.560
E. FOLEY: And rich
Victorian white women.

00:52:18.560 --> 00:52:19.880
B. COATES: Very wealthy
Victorian white women.

00:52:19.880 --> 00:52:20.540
E. FOLEY: So that's
why there are

00:52:20.540 --> 00:52:21.780
queens in all of these books.

00:52:21.780 --> 00:52:23.863
Because there's loads of
documentation about them,

00:52:23.863 --> 00:52:26.714
so obviously it makes
the research richer.

00:52:26.714 --> 00:52:27.380
B. COATES: Yeah.

00:52:27.380 --> 00:52:29.421
But we were clear that we
didn't want to do that.

00:52:29.421 --> 00:52:33.170
We wanted to go to slightly
unusual places in the world

00:52:33.170 --> 00:52:36.300
and also in history and see
what lessons you could draw.

00:52:36.300 --> 00:52:36.860
E. FOLEY: Because
there were women

00:52:36.860 --> 00:52:38.840
we discovered for the first
time in writing the book,

00:52:38.840 --> 00:52:40.590
and that's something
that we wanted to do,

00:52:40.590 --> 00:52:42.932
was find out about people
that we'd never heard of.

00:52:42.932 --> 00:52:44.390
And so we have
quite a few of them,

00:52:44.390 --> 00:52:46.470
as well as having
the big famous ones.

00:52:46.470 --> 00:52:48.140
B. COATES: Thank
you for having us.

00:52:48.140 --> 00:52:51.790
[APPLAUSE]
