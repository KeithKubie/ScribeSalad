maybe it's not super power up it's a
 

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:33.200
maybe it's not super power up it's a
multiple power picture where everybody

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210
multiple power picture where everybody
 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.420
multiple power picture where everybody
would will seek to work with everyone

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430

else in a more closer manner and I

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:38.420
else in a more closer manner and I
 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:41.360
else in a more closer manner and I
believe that now is standing a lot of

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370
believe that now is standing a lot of
 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.639

you know in various countries and you

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590
you know in various countries and you
 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.680
you know in various countries and you
know in some cases they would have to

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:30.690
know in some cases they would have to
 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:34.060

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780
but in many cases they also need to be
 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.900
but in many cases they also need to be
very local you know in places like the

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:38.910
very local you know in places like the
 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:42.260
