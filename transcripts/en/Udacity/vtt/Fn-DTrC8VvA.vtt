00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
We're just applying the length function to all these strings

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
and friends--1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7--has 7 characters in it,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
so we're just going to get a 7.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
This approach to defining a list where you use square brackets--

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
but instead of explicitly listing the elements list a formula

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
that's applied to every element in another list--is called a list comprehension.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
We comprehend the new list to be made out of transformations

00:00:26.000 --> 09:59:59.000
of the elements in the old one.
