little bit of a filler but again we just
 

00:17:06.780 --> 00:17:08.300
little bit of a filler but again we just
need those moments for characters to

00:17:08.300 --> 00:17:08.310
need those moments for characters to
 

00:17:08.310 --> 00:17:10.130

or Worf or something like that you can
have the characters just breathe and you

00:17:26.689 --> 00:17:26.699
have the characters just breathe and you
 

00:17:26.699 --> 00:17:28.909
have the characters just breathe and you

00:17:52.970 --> 00:17:52.980
yeah Katara I even Zuko's I think is a
 

00:17:52.980 --> 00:17:54.139
yeah Katara I even Zuko's I think is a
little more necessary

00:17:54.139 --> 00:17:54.149
little more necessary
 

00:17:54.149 --> 00:17:56.239
little more necessary
you could argue I think in this episode

00:17:56.239 --> 00:17:56.249
you could argue I think in this episode
 

00:17:56.249 --> 00:17:58.700

00:17:58.700 --> 00:17:58.710
that that could quite possibly be fill a
 

00:17:58.710 --> 00:18:00.379
that that could quite possibly be fill a
really good filler but you could argue

00:18:00.379 --> 00:18:00.389
really good filler but you could argue
 

00:18:00.389 --> 00:18:01.399
really good filler but you could argue

00:18:03.700 --> 00:18:03.710
incorporate that into a main plotline
 

00:18:03.710 --> 00:18:07.820
incorporate that into a main plotline
