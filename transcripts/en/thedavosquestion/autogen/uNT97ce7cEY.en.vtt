&gt;&gt;I think once you resolve the Middle East
conflict between Israeli and

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:13.800
Palestinian, you have stability in the region.
And all the resources would be directed to

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:20.310
peace, to economic goals
instead of to war and the increasing the work

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.250
 -- the armor for each
country.

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:27.609
So a lot of funds, a lot of money would be
spent in economic goals of

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:34.390
the countries surrounding Israel and Palestine
rather than spending it

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:35.840
on preparing for war.
