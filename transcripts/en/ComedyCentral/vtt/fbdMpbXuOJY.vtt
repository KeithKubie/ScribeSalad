00:00:01.768 --> 00:00:03.737
- First up, an alternative
to GhostBussing.

00:00:03.737 --> 00:00:06.073
Earlier this month Lyft
had a special ghost mode

00:00:06.073 --> 00:00:08.141
where you could get
picked up by Ecto-1.

00:00:08.141 --> 00:00:09.910
Normally ghost mode is reserved

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:11.311
for Tinder after (bleep) date.

00:00:11.311 --> 00:00:12.145
But not anymore.

00:00:12.145 --> 00:00:13.413
(laughter)

00:00:13.413 --> 00:00:14.848
This allows you to ride
around in a kickass car

00:00:14.848 --> 00:00:16.149
from the movie while
making awkward small talk

00:00:16.149 --> 00:00:17.918
with your driver about
their acting career.

00:00:17.918 --> 00:00:20.287
Comedians, you're
Ghostbusting experts,

00:00:20.287 --> 00:00:21.221
what's something you might hear

00:00:21.221 --> 00:00:22.489
from a Lyft driver in Ecto-1.

00:00:22.489 --> 00:00:23.323
(beep)

00:00:23.323 --> 00:00:24.558
Paul Feig.

00:00:24.558 --> 00:00:26.693
- Um, thanks for ruining
my childhood asshole.

00:00:26.693 --> 00:00:29.162
(laughter)

00:00:29.162 --> 00:00:33.467
And to be clear, they
only say that to me.

00:00:33.467 --> 00:00:35.702
(laughter)
