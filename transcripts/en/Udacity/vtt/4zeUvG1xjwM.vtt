00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.050
Alright, so we're going to go in the opposite direction now. And we're

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:05.040
saying, we're going to tell you what we want y to be, we

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.550
want y to be the or function. So it should be outputting

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.400
a one if either x one or x two is one, and

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.810
otherwise it should output a zero. And what you need to do

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:17.700
is fill in numbers for weight one, weight two, and theta so

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:21.380
that it has that semantics. Now, just so you know, there is

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:25.770
no unique answer here. There's a whole bunch of answers that will work,

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:27.570
but we're going to check to see that

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.530
you've actually typed in one that, that works.
