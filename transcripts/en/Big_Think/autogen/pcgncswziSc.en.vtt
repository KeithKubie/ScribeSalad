politicians are meddling in the affairs

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.020
politicians are meddling in the affairs
 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.350
politicians are meddling in the affairs
of science and doesn't that mean that

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360
of science and doesn't that mean that
 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.560
