[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.799 --> 00:00:07.590
SPEAKER: I'm really
excited to host Sharon.

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:09.760
And she's going to
speak about her book

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:12.190
that comes out
officially June 7,

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:14.290
next week, called "Real Love."

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:18.550
And "Real Love" is
her 10th book, which

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:20.770
is quite a feat in itself.

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:24.640
So a couple of things about
Sharon before we get started.

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:27.940
Sharon is a longtime
meditator and practitioner

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:29.740
of mindfulness.

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:37.150
And Sharon is a leading
expert and renowned expert

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:41.410
in the field for being in a
mindful state, whether it's

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:47.620
leading meditational sits
or workshops or seminars.

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:50.420
I think she does
everything, pretty much.

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.240
So it's really exciting
to have her here today.

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:56.080
And I think with that,
I'll hand it over

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:58.075
to Sharon, who's going
to share about what

00:00:58.075 --> 00:00:59.200
we're going to cover today.

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.660
And we'll take
questions at the end.

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:03.332
Thank you, and welcome Sharon.

00:01:03.332 --> 00:01:04.456
SHARON SALZBERG: Thank you.

00:01:04.456 --> 00:01:05.914
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:05.914 --> 00:01:07.858
Thank you.

00:01:07.858 --> 00:01:12.400
It's so lovely to be here again.

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:13.750
I was actually at Google once.

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:16.270
And Bill Duane was
introducing me.

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:20.860
And he said, Sharon is an OG.

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:21.820
So I said, what's that?

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:24.130
And he said, original gangster.

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:25.750
I said, oh, OK.

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:29.260
Referring to not
only my age, but that

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.980
I had gone to India kind
of early in that wave.

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:38.100
I went in 1970 and came back as
a meditation teacher in 1974.

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.280
So kind of preceded a
lot of current interest

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.580
in the popularization
of these qualities

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:49.420
and the methodologies of
meditation, mindfulness,

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.120
and now, increasingly,
loving-kindness and compassion,

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:56.530
which is really what
I've specialized in,

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:58.570
in a way, although I teach
a lot of mindfulness.

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:00.986
I don't know if I am mindful
all the time, as Rachel said,

00:02:00.986 --> 00:02:04.980
but I do teach it a lot.

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:09.940
And sort of in that
evolution, my own evolution,

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:14.440
where I started out using
methods of meditation

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:17.980
to try to be more aware and
to understand myself more,

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:21.450
and really frankly, to be
a lot happier than I was.

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.170
I was 18 years old
when I went to India.

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:25.670
And I was a junior in college.

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:30.030
And I went through a
university program.

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:34.697
And that, of course, was why I
went, because I looked around

00:02:34.697 --> 00:02:36.280
where I was going
to school and I just

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.620
didn't see the actual
how-to, the ways to meditate,

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:41.440
to bring it to life anywhere.

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.710
And it took that kind of
journey in those days.

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:46.510
So I've been really
interested just sort

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:49.760
of watching this wave
happen and realized,

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.630
you don't have to go anywhere
anymore if you don't want to.

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:54.760
And look at that.

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:56.840
What does that mean
for us here and now?

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.930
So I started with
mindfulness practice,

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:02.530
which was enormous for me.

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:06.100
And I also heard that there
were different techniques

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:10.570
available that would emphasize
qualities like loving-kindness

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:11.330
and compassion.

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:14.980
So loving-kindness is a
really odd term, I know.

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:19.300
And it it's not, generally
speaking, the kind of term

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:22.790
you hear people talking
about casually somewhere.

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:25.660
And that makes me
concerned that that

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:28.450
might make the quality
itself seem somewhat arcane

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:30.839
and removed from
day-to-day life.

00:03:30.839 --> 00:03:31.630
Like, what is that?

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:34.480
Like something
quaint, something sort

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.880
of sanctimonious or
something like that.

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:39.520
But actually, it's meant
to be a live, vital sense

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:44.050
of connection, to
not feel so isolated,

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:48.010
not to isolate others,
to have a sense of being

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:49.630
a part of a greater whole.

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:51.760
As one friend of
mine quipped as we

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:55.220
were driving along somewhere,
caught in terrible traffic,

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:59.050
and they were complaining
bitterly about the traffic,

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:01.940
and the traffic was so
wretched and so terrible.

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:05.995
And then they paused and said,
I guess we're the traffic, too.

00:04:05.995 --> 00:04:08.170
You know, what's it
like when we're not

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:11.860
considering ourselves separate
and apart in those ways?

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:15.970
Where the kind of constructs of
self and other and us and them,

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:19.959
where the great big other out
there are seen as constructs.

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:21.550
They may be useful.

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:24.170
They may be inappropriate
in certain situations.

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:25.870
But they're just constructs.

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:28.870
The reality is that we live
in an interconnected universe.

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:30.790
And here we are, right?

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:34.210
It's a world that's pointing
to that all of the time.

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:37.510
But our values, our
behavior, don't always

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:39.880
reflect that truth.

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:43.420
And so being able
to see more clearly,

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:45.850
to see more accurately,
to see the interconnected

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:50.500
nature of things is one
of the strongest ways

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:54.850
to leap into a sense
of loving-kindness,

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:57.580
just honoring that
state of connection.

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:59.440
Loving-kindness, or
love in this case,

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:01.350
since I'm now using
the word love,

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:03.460
doesn't mean you like everybody.

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:06.580
It actually doesn't even mean
you necessarily like anybody.

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:10.680
But we do understand
our lives have something

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:12.160
to do with one another.

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:14.460
It's a deep, deep
acknowledgement

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:17.940
that we do live in this kind
of world of connection--

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:20.580
in effect, that we
are all the traffic.

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:22.030
I have a friend,
Bob Thurman, who

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:24.570
is a professor of Buddhist
studies at Columbia University.

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:28.900
And he uses this image a lot--
which I actually, I think,

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:30.860
I use much more than he does--

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:35.910
where he says, imagine you're
on a subway and these martians

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:38.364
come, and they zap
the subway cars

00:05:38.364 --> 00:05:39.780
so that those of
you who are there

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:42.740
are going to be
together forever.

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:43.870
He says, what do you do?

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:46.191
Like, if somebody is
hungry, you feed them.

00:05:46.191 --> 00:05:48.440
If somebody's freaking out,
you try to calm them down,

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:51.650
not because you necessarily like
them or you approve of them,

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:54.320
but because you're going
to be together forever.

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:56.150
So guess what?

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:58.140
There's a lot of truth to that.

00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:02.660
So this notion of
interconnection

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:05.120
isn't always like--
it's not sentimental.

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:09.110
It's not saccharin, sweet.

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:11.600
It's not even very
nice sometimes.

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:14.630
But it is that
fundamental recognition

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:18.140
that what happens over there
doesn't nicely stay over there.

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:21.030
It really ripples out over here.

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:23.660
And what we do, where we put
our energy, what we care about,

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:26.080
it matters because it's
going to ripple out

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:27.350
in just that same way.

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:30.700
And here we are in a world
where science is showing us this

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:33.020
and economics is
showing us this.

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:34.910
And certainly,
environmental consciousness

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:36.210
is showing us this.

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:38.420
Even epidemiology
is showing us this.

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:40.940
Here we are.

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:43.780
And can our lives actually
reflect that truth

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:46.194
in deeper and deeper ways?

00:06:46.194 --> 00:06:48.110
So sometimes when I tell
that story about Bob,

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:49.560
I go on to tell this story.

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:55.250
I was in New York City once,
sitting on an airplane, which--

00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:57.410
trying to get to Tucson.

00:06:57.410 --> 00:07:03.210
And the plane sat on the tarmac
for about 4 and 1/2 hours,

00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:04.840
in what, looking
back, I sometimes

00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:07.610
now call the breakdown
of civilization,

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:09.449
because it was getting
hotter and hotter

00:07:09.449 --> 00:07:11.240
and people were getting
angrier and angrier

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:15.190
and screaming and yelling,
like, get me off this plane.

00:07:15.190 --> 00:07:17.360
And I wasn't feeling
all that chiper myself.

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:18.290
You know, I was
sitting there thinking,

00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:19.730
I'm paying rent
in New York City.

00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:21.360
If they'd only let
me off the plane,

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:23.690
I could go home and
try again tomorrow.

00:07:23.690 --> 00:07:26.600
At one point, the pilot sort of
took command of the aircraft.

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:28.730
He got on the PA
system and he said,

00:07:28.730 --> 00:07:31.390
no one is getting
off this plane.

00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:34.640
So I was sitting there
and not feeling very good.

00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:36.610
And then all of a sudden,
that image of Bob's

00:07:36.610 --> 00:07:40.480
that I had used so often in
teaching came up in my mind.

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:44.410
Like, imagine you're on a
subway and these martians

00:07:44.410 --> 00:07:47.274
come, and they
zapped the subway car

00:07:47.274 --> 00:07:48.690
so that those of
you who are there

00:07:48.690 --> 00:07:51.276
are going to be
together forever.

00:07:51.276 --> 00:07:52.650
And I looked around
the airplane,

00:07:52.650 --> 00:07:55.410
and I thought, maybe
these are my people.

00:07:55.410 --> 00:07:59.050
Here we are, maybe forever.

00:07:59.050 --> 00:08:01.427
And I realized in that
moment a good deal of my ire

00:08:01.427 --> 00:08:03.760
was this feeling of, like,
how long am I stuck with you?

00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:04.885
And it's like, oh, forever.

00:08:04.885 --> 00:08:05.790
Deal.

00:08:05.790 --> 00:08:06.480
Right?

00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:07.650
This is it.

00:08:07.650 --> 00:08:10.560
How are we going to
deal with one another?

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:13.320
And that very much
is the sensibility

00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:18.960
I bring into the practice of
loving-kindness meditation.

00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:21.025
We can develop
deepened qualities

00:08:21.025 --> 00:08:22.960
like compassion
and self-compassion

00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:26.250
and understand them,
which is very important,

00:08:26.250 --> 00:08:30.820
and really explore
those qualities

00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:32.110
in lots of different ways.

00:08:32.110 --> 00:08:36.250
Obviously, life lends us
a lot of opportunities

00:08:36.250 --> 00:08:38.230
just every day.

00:08:38.230 --> 00:08:40.299
Doing a simple
method of meditation

00:08:40.299 --> 00:08:44.260
like putting your attention
on the feeling of the breath,

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:49.260
some object like that, and
having to continually return

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:51.510
your attention to
that object will

00:08:51.510 --> 00:08:54.630
deepen the qualities of
loving-kindness and, first,

00:08:54.630 --> 00:08:57.330
self-compassion,
which will blossom out

00:08:57.330 --> 00:08:58.830
into compassion for others.

00:08:58.830 --> 00:09:02.480
Because there's actually no
way to do it successfully

00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:03.900
without that deepening.

00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:05.700
Even if it's never
voiced, it's never

00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:09.210
articulated, it's never named,
that's what we're actually

00:09:09.210 --> 00:09:10.400
doing.

00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:11.500
So I got to India.

00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:15.150
And I first learned
meditation in the context

00:09:15.150 --> 00:09:16.500
of an intensive 10-day retreat.

00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:18.990
That's how I started.

00:09:18.990 --> 00:09:22.390
And the first
instruction I was given

00:09:22.390 --> 00:09:25.970
was, sit down and
feel your breath.

00:09:25.970 --> 00:09:28.030
And first of all, I
was very disappointed.

00:09:28.030 --> 00:09:30.070
I thought, feel my breath?

00:09:30.070 --> 00:09:31.621
I came all the way to India.

00:09:31.621 --> 00:09:34.120
You know, where's the magical,
esoteric, fantastic technique

00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:36.385
that's going to
transform my whole life?

00:09:36.385 --> 00:09:38.200
I thought, feel my breath?

00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:40.100
I could've stayed home
to feel my breath.

00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:42.070
And then I thought, eh,
how hard can this be?

00:09:42.070 --> 00:09:43.600
It's going to be a snap.

00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:46.240
Well, haha, it wasn't that easy.

00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:47.680
I'd thought, OK,
what will it be?

00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:50.890
Like 800 breaths, 900
breaths before my mind

00:09:50.890 --> 00:09:52.450
starts to wander?

00:09:52.450 --> 00:09:57.300
And to my astonishment, it was
like one breath or two breaths

00:09:57.300 --> 00:09:58.150
and I would be gone.

00:09:58.150 --> 00:10:00.310
And I'd be way gone.

00:10:00.310 --> 00:10:03.670
And then comes the magic
moment where you think,

00:10:03.670 --> 00:10:06.980
been some time since
I last felt a breath.

00:10:06.980 --> 00:10:09.060
And I was told over and
over and over again,

00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:11.810
but did not believe
that that was actually

00:10:11.810 --> 00:10:13.670
the critical moment
in the whole process,

00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:19.810
because that's the moment of
being able to be different.

00:10:19.810 --> 00:10:22.190
Instead of judging yourself
and being harsh and feeling

00:10:22.190 --> 00:10:27.740
like a failure and spending
the next four hours, say, just

00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:30.320
in that rant about
yourself, thereby extending

00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:32.750
the period of the
distraction and leaving

00:10:32.750 --> 00:10:35.480
yourself exhausted
and demoralized,

00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:37.670
we learn how to let go.

00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:39.315
Just let go gently.

00:10:39.315 --> 00:10:41.540
What one of my teachers
called exercising

00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:42.960
the letting-go muscle.

00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:44.660
And we learned how
to begin again.

00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:46.370
Just let go and come back.

00:10:46.370 --> 00:10:50.230
And that coming back is an
expression of self-compassion,

00:10:50.230 --> 00:10:54.110
because the nearly
overwhelming temptation is just

00:10:54.110 --> 00:10:58.950
to go on that rant, you know,
and to get lost in that.

00:10:58.950 --> 00:11:00.810
And this is a chance
to be different,

00:11:00.810 --> 00:11:02.670
which is a challenge, right?

00:11:02.670 --> 00:11:04.560
The building block
of that difference

00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:06.535
is some kindness
towards yourself.

00:11:06.535 --> 00:11:09.270
And the reason I said it's
so important to understand it

00:11:09.270 --> 00:11:12.360
is because that doesn't
mean being lazy or not

00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:15.900
having standards of excellence
or not having an edge,

00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:17.810
not having commitment.

00:11:17.810 --> 00:11:20.850
It's actually a
pretty radical notion

00:11:20.850 --> 00:11:25.560
of what is the best way to
succeed and make a change

00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:28.300
and learn something new.

00:11:28.300 --> 00:11:32.230
Because think of all that
time we spend in those rants,

00:11:32.230 --> 00:11:35.030
and think of how
we feel at the end.

00:11:35.030 --> 00:11:37.390
So that's why we
say that meditation

00:11:37.390 --> 00:11:40.160
is a practice of resilience.

00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:43.480
So that's a tremendous way,
whatever process we do,

00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:48.910
of building that almost
unspoken but known sense

00:11:48.910 --> 00:11:52.180
of loving-kindness.

00:11:52.180 --> 00:11:55.090
We practice through insight,
through understanding,

00:11:55.090 --> 00:11:59.560
through anything we do, anything
we perceive anew in a way

00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:02.620
so that we see our
assumptions of aloneness

00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:06.520
and a sense of isolation,
our assumptions

00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:10.330
of fundamental difference
are really assumptions.

00:12:10.330 --> 00:12:12.560
And we get to question them.

00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:15.980
You know, is it so
that this person

00:12:15.980 --> 00:12:23.660
at the other end of the world is
so very different, ultimately?

00:12:23.660 --> 00:12:24.580
Is it?

00:12:24.580 --> 00:12:26.075
Well, let's check it out.

00:12:26.075 --> 00:12:29.460
We live in a time where
we can check it out.

00:12:29.460 --> 00:12:31.830
And we can check it
out within as well--

00:12:31.830 --> 00:12:35.170
the ways we categorize people,
the ways we dismiss people,

00:12:35.170 --> 00:12:37.730
the ways we don't see people.

00:12:37.730 --> 00:12:40.210
If you think about all the
people, perhaps in your life,

00:12:40.210 --> 00:12:44.708
that you tend to look
through instead of look at.

00:12:44.708 --> 00:12:47.290
The places where we
create an other, not

00:12:47.290 --> 00:12:49.840
even just through
bias or prejudice,

00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:51.770
but just indifference.

00:12:51.770 --> 00:12:52.960
Like, who doesn't count?

00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:55.110
Who doesn't matter?

00:12:55.110 --> 00:12:57.490
And what happens when
you look more carefully?

00:12:57.490 --> 00:12:58.170
That's all.

00:12:58.170 --> 00:13:04.050
It's not trying to exist in,
awash with a certain feeling,

00:13:04.050 --> 00:13:08.280
but just looking more carefully,
seeing things more as they are.

00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:12.330
There's this tremendous
opening into that kind

00:13:12.330 --> 00:13:14.670
of state of connection.

00:13:14.670 --> 00:13:17.500
And there are ways of
actually stretching.

00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:19.830
It's kind of practicing
in certain ways,

00:13:19.830 --> 00:13:22.790
practicing paying
attention differently,

00:13:22.790 --> 00:13:29.280
so that we are putting our
attention in a place where

00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:32.940
these qualities of
connection can emerge.

00:13:32.940 --> 00:13:38.014
The question comes up, you know,
what do we pay attention to?

00:13:38.014 --> 00:13:39.430
If we're thinking
about ourselves,

00:13:39.430 --> 00:13:44.700
are we singularly consumed with
just the mistakes we've made?

00:13:44.700 --> 00:13:47.910
Or can we leave a little
room for a bigger picture?

00:13:47.910 --> 00:13:50.130
Those mistakes may be true.

00:13:50.130 --> 00:13:51.820
If you come to the
end of the day,

00:13:51.820 --> 00:13:54.240
if you're almost
evaluating yourself,

00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:56.760
yes, maybe you weren't perfect.

00:13:56.760 --> 00:13:59.340
But what is the standard
of perfection anyway?

00:13:59.340 --> 00:14:02.340
And what if we only
obsess about and are

00:14:02.340 --> 00:14:06.420
consumed with and captivated
by those mistakes,

00:14:06.420 --> 00:14:10.070
to the detriment of there
being a more truthful picture?

00:14:10.070 --> 00:14:13.350
Can we give a little air
time to the other side?

00:14:13.350 --> 00:14:15.230
Can we?

00:14:15.230 --> 00:14:18.460
So what do we pay attention to?

00:14:18.460 --> 00:14:19.930
And who do we pay attention to?

00:14:19.930 --> 00:14:25.175
As I said before, who can
we look through rather than

00:14:25.175 --> 00:14:25.675
look at?

00:14:28.580 --> 00:14:30.420
And how do we pay attention?

00:14:30.420 --> 00:14:31.560
How present are we?

00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:33.700
How scattered are we?

00:14:33.700 --> 00:14:35.880
How much are we looking
around the room,

00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:37.880
seeing who might be more
interesting to talk to?

00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:41.310
Who have we already decided,
oh, well, I heard about you,

00:14:41.310 --> 00:14:41.810
you know?

00:14:41.810 --> 00:14:42.518
You're like that.

00:14:45.180 --> 00:14:47.720
No need to listen.

00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:51.110
And if we see those things,
if we see those habits

00:14:51.110 --> 00:14:53.840
or we see those
tendencies, we can actually

00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:56.090
relax them or
relinquish them and be

00:14:56.090 --> 00:14:58.190
there in a different
way, which is

00:14:58.190 --> 00:15:01.760
the ground for a certain
sense of connection

00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:03.830
that I'm calling
loving-kindness.

00:15:03.830 --> 00:15:05.360
These days I call
it love, partly

00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:07.010
because that's the book title.

00:15:07.010 --> 00:15:12.820
But actually, people like Bob
Thurman, who is a scholar,

00:15:12.820 --> 00:15:17.080
has said to me in the
past, loving-kindness

00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:19.460
is so quirky a term.

00:15:19.460 --> 00:15:21.440
Like, what does that mean?

00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:23.980
You should just say love.

00:15:23.980 --> 00:15:28.210
And so I'm experimenting,
clearly, with that.

00:15:28.210 --> 00:15:31.940
Love is a complicated,
complicated term.

00:15:31.940 --> 00:15:35.280
What do we mean by love?

00:15:35.280 --> 00:15:39.550
Sometimes we really frankly
mean a medium of exchange.

00:15:39.550 --> 00:15:43.310
I will love you as long
as you love me in return

00:15:43.310 --> 00:15:47.260
and as long as you evidence
that in these 15 ways.

00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:49.990
I will love myself as long
as I never make a mistake.

00:15:49.990 --> 00:15:54.160
Well, what does
that mean really?

00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:56.050
We know the fragility
of that state

00:15:56.050 --> 00:15:58.362
and the breakability
of that state.

00:15:58.362 --> 00:16:00.070
But really, we're
talking about something

00:16:00.070 --> 00:16:03.840
that can be more
sustained or more renewed,

00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:07.770
that can really support us.

00:16:07.770 --> 00:16:13.760
When we talk about loving an
other, what does that mean?

00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:16.280
In some ways, the
evolution of this book

00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:19.550
actually is almost
entirely based on one line

00:16:19.550 --> 00:16:24.230
from a movie, which the movie
is called "Dan In Real Life."

00:16:24.230 --> 00:16:28.700
It's maybe now 13, 14 years
old, something like that.

00:16:28.700 --> 00:16:31.490
My god-daughter was in
it, so I can kind of

00:16:31.490 --> 00:16:32.900
place the movie by her.

00:16:32.900 --> 00:16:34.880
She was really a very
little girl then,

00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:37.790
and she just went to college.

00:16:37.790 --> 00:16:44.640
So the line in the movie
is, "Love is not a feeling;

00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:46.810
it's an ability."

00:16:46.810 --> 00:16:48.890
Love is not a feeling;
it's an ability.

00:16:48.890 --> 00:16:51.850
And this is very
resonant with what

00:16:51.850 --> 00:16:56.470
we call loving-kindness or
even the state of compassion.

00:16:56.470 --> 00:16:58.300
Of course, it is
a feeling as well,

00:16:58.300 --> 00:17:02.300
and it's a feeling that in
terms of cultural pressure

00:17:02.300 --> 00:17:06.619
and conditioning we yearn for,
we want, we identify with,

00:17:06.619 --> 00:17:09.569
or the lack of with.

00:17:09.569 --> 00:17:13.230
But think of it for a moment
as an ability instead.

00:17:13.230 --> 00:17:15.930
It's a response
mechanism, right?

00:17:15.930 --> 00:17:17.329
It's a way of being with.

00:17:17.329 --> 00:17:19.060
It's a worldview.

00:17:19.060 --> 00:17:23.050
It's a way of being present
with ourselves and with others.

00:17:23.050 --> 00:17:25.829
It's a way of caring.

00:17:25.829 --> 00:17:30.840
Like looking around that
subway and thinking,

00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:33.800
we're going to be
together forever.

00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:38.980
So it's a matter of inclusion
rather than exclusion.

00:17:38.980 --> 00:17:42.640
It's seeing the assumptions
that come up in one's mind

00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:45.850
and being willing
to question them.

00:17:45.850 --> 00:17:52.520
Because in the end, it doesn't
make that much sense, really,

00:17:52.520 --> 00:17:54.470
that we don't all
want to be happy,

00:17:54.470 --> 00:18:00.360
that we don't want a sense of
belonging, things like that.

00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:02.880
Love is an ability.

00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:04.750
And I was very
captivated by that line,

00:18:04.750 --> 00:18:07.240
"love is not a feeling;
it's an ability,"

00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:11.020
in part because it did so
resonate with experiences

00:18:11.020 --> 00:18:15.380
I had had doing
loving-kindness meditation.

00:18:15.380 --> 00:18:19.300
So in addition to just
concentration techniques

00:18:19.300 --> 00:18:23.230
like being with the breath and
kind of the stealth cultivation

00:18:23.230 --> 00:18:27.040
of self-compassion and seeing
more clearly and having

00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:30.190
more insight, there
are definitely

00:18:30.190 --> 00:18:33.610
techniques that are
devoted to the deepening

00:18:33.610 --> 00:18:34.480
of those qualities.

00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:37.690
And I first did them
really intensively

00:18:37.690 --> 00:18:42.100
when I was in Burma in 1985,
doing a three-month period

00:18:42.100 --> 00:18:42.760
of practice.

00:18:42.760 --> 00:18:46.390
And I had a very profound
experience when I was there.

00:18:46.390 --> 00:18:49.330
And I think, like many
profound experiences,

00:18:49.330 --> 00:18:51.400
it doesn't sound like
much in words, perhaps.

00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:54.340
But it really
changed a lot for me.

00:18:54.340 --> 00:18:58.490
And that was some sense
that prior to that moment,

00:18:58.490 --> 00:19:01.210
I had thought of
love as a commodity,

00:19:01.210 --> 00:19:04.990
very much like a package
in someone else's hands.

00:19:04.990 --> 00:19:08.500
And it was in their power
to deliver it unto me

00:19:08.500 --> 00:19:10.810
or to take it away from me.

00:19:10.810 --> 00:19:15.167
And if someone took it
away from me, it was gone.

00:19:15.167 --> 00:19:17.250
Every breath, there was,
like, no love in my life.

00:19:17.250 --> 00:19:21.300
It was a little bit like the UPS
person standing on my doorstep,

00:19:21.300 --> 00:19:23.930
looking at the address,
thinking, I don't think so,

00:19:23.930 --> 00:19:24.930
and going the other way.

00:19:28.470 --> 00:19:33.160
Whereas if I see love as an
ability, it's within me, right?

00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:34.800
It's within my power.

00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:38.340
And other people or
circumstances or art--

00:19:38.340 --> 00:19:40.290
I mean, so many things
might enliven it

00:19:40.290 --> 00:19:43.030
and awaken that capacity.

00:19:43.030 --> 00:19:46.360
They might enrich it.

00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:48.631
They might threaten it.

00:19:48.631 --> 00:19:50.960
They might make it
very, very difficult.

00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:53.510
But it's not in their
hands, ultimately.

00:19:53.510 --> 00:19:55.770
It's in mine.

00:19:55.770 --> 00:19:57.280
And that was hugely empowering.

00:19:57.280 --> 00:20:00.190
Love is not a feeling;
it's an ability.

00:20:00.190 --> 00:20:06.190
And that really is the thread
that runs throughout this work.

00:20:06.190 --> 00:20:09.980
So the whole first
section of the book

00:20:09.980 --> 00:20:14.390
is about love for oneself, not
in a narcissistic, egotistical

00:20:14.390 --> 00:20:15.920
sense, of course--

00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:18.560
which I think narcissism is
something very different.

00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:21.680
And it's not about
being self-preoccupied

00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:23.000
to the exclusion of others.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:26.840
But it's about really seeing
ourselves differently.

00:20:26.840 --> 00:20:31.200
I tell this story in there
about seeing a cartoon once

00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:34.710
from the "Peanuts" comic strip.

00:20:34.710 --> 00:20:37.560
And the two characters are
Lucy and Charlie Brown.

00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:42.630
And Lucy says to Charlie Brown,
you know what your problem is?

00:20:42.630 --> 00:20:45.451
The problem with you
is that you're you.

00:20:45.451 --> 00:20:47.580
And in the second frame,
poor Charlie Brown

00:20:47.580 --> 00:20:50.430
says, well, what in the
world can I do about that?

00:20:50.430 --> 00:20:51.930
Then in the third
and final frame,

00:20:51.930 --> 00:20:55.200
Lucy says, I don't pretend
to be able to give advice.

00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:58.860
I merely point out the problem.

00:20:58.860 --> 00:21:01.200
And somehow, whenever I
was walking by the desk

00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:04.650
that this cartoon was
on, my eye would always

00:21:04.650 --> 00:21:06.390
fall on that precise
line-- the problem

00:21:06.390 --> 00:21:08.430
with you is that you're you.

00:21:08.430 --> 00:21:13.260
It's like if you really knew
who you were, big problem.

00:21:13.260 --> 00:21:15.810
Because that Lucy-dominant
voice had been so strong

00:21:15.810 --> 00:21:17.880
in my earlier life.

00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:20.790
And I will also say that
through particularly mindfulness

00:21:20.790 --> 00:21:23.940
meditation tools,
I'd learned to have

00:21:23.940 --> 00:21:28.680
a very different relationship
to Lucy, which was basically

00:21:28.680 --> 00:21:32.310
seeing that voice,
hearing that message,

00:21:32.310 --> 00:21:35.810
and being able to
respond with, hi, Lucy,

00:21:35.810 --> 00:21:39.960
or chill out, Lucy, or have
a seat, have a cup of tea,

00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:41.170
just relax.

00:21:41.170 --> 00:21:43.190
Instead of like, oh my
god, Lucy's still here.

00:21:43.190 --> 00:21:45.540
I've been meditating all these
years and Lucy's still here.

00:21:45.540 --> 00:21:47.280
All that money in therapy,
and Lucy's still here.

00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:48.196
What a terrible thing.

00:21:51.060 --> 00:21:53.247
Or you're right, Lucy.

00:21:53.247 --> 00:21:54.080
You're always right.

00:21:56.690 --> 00:21:59.630
So that kind of creative
domain in between,

00:21:59.630 --> 00:22:02.360
where we can respond
very, very differently,

00:22:02.360 --> 00:22:05.960
is really-- that's the land
of mindfulness right there.

00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:09.180
So how do we relate to
ourselves differently?

00:22:09.180 --> 00:22:11.790
Having a sense almost of
a kind of innate dignity

00:22:11.790 --> 00:22:14.970
that exists within
us, that we can

00:22:14.970 --> 00:22:17.880
design our life
around and respond

00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:22.160
to others in the same way.

00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:25.160
And the second
section of the book

00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:28.950
was really about
love for an other,

00:22:28.950 --> 00:22:31.700
whether it's a
partner or a parent

00:22:31.700 --> 00:22:35.800
or a child or a friend or
a colleague or whatever.

00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:44.370
And when I was first kind
of researching the book,

00:22:44.370 --> 00:22:46.740
I met with a lot of groups
and a lot of people.

00:22:46.740 --> 00:22:52.030
I was really seeking stories
and people's experiences.

00:22:52.030 --> 00:22:56.490
The first time I met with a
group, this man raised his hand

00:22:56.490 --> 00:23:01.440
and he said, most people
think of a good relationship

00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:03.210
as 50-50.

00:23:03.210 --> 00:23:07.170
My dog and I were 100-100.

00:23:07.170 --> 00:23:08.210
And I loved that.

00:23:12.340 --> 00:23:18.240
And the real part comes in in
that the sense of generosity,

00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:21.472
connection, caring is real.

00:23:21.472 --> 00:23:22.180
It's not feigned.

00:23:22.180 --> 00:23:24.510
It's not coerced.

00:23:24.510 --> 00:23:26.910
It's not forced.

00:23:26.910 --> 00:23:28.480
So here's a little section.

00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:32.239
"For example, no matter
what we think we should do,

00:23:32.239 --> 00:23:33.780
I don't think you
can coerce yourself

00:23:33.780 --> 00:23:35.670
into loving your
neighbor or your boss

00:23:35.670 --> 00:23:37.940
when you can't stand them.

00:23:37.940 --> 00:23:40.520
But if you try to understand
your feelings of dislike

00:23:40.520 --> 00:23:43.010
with mindfulness and
compassion, being

00:23:43.010 --> 00:23:45.770
sure not to forget
self-compassion,

00:23:45.770 --> 00:23:48.920
you create the
possibility for change.

00:23:48.920 --> 00:23:52.460
Your neighbor or your boss may
still do things that annoy you,

00:23:52.460 --> 00:23:54.680
but the anger and tightness
you feel in your chest

00:23:54.680 --> 00:23:59.300
whenever you see them is bound
to diminish, leaving you freer

00:23:59.300 --> 00:24:03.720
and more available for love."

00:24:03.720 --> 00:24:06.720
This is basically
what we do, you know?

00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:09.945
It's not to try to
pretend in any way-- well,

00:24:09.945 --> 00:24:14.310
I'm sure this man really loved
his dog more than anything.

00:24:14.310 --> 00:24:17.580
You know, it's not to enter a
state of hypocrisy or pretense,

00:24:17.580 --> 00:24:20.550
or certainly not to try to
force yourself into anything,

00:24:20.550 --> 00:24:23.550
but it's awakening to
different possibilities.

00:24:23.550 --> 00:24:27.960
You know what it's like when
you're sure you know somebody,

00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:29.770
and then you find out
something about them,

00:24:29.770 --> 00:24:33.350
and it's like,
that's a surprise?

00:24:33.350 --> 00:24:39.400
And the sense of almost like
awe that happens in that moment.

00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:42.650
Like whoa, who
could have guessed?

00:24:42.650 --> 00:24:45.660
I didn't know you did that,
or I didn't know whatever.

00:24:45.660 --> 00:24:49.960
I also tell this story in
the book about assumptions

00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:54.460
and how a friend of mine who's
a writer gave a talk somewhere.

00:24:54.460 --> 00:25:00.860
And he, in the
context of the talk,

00:25:00.860 --> 00:25:03.470
he spoke about Proust
and reading Proust

00:25:03.470 --> 00:25:06.590
and "Remembrances
of Things Past,"

00:25:06.590 --> 00:25:10.162
which had been a very
important book for him

00:25:10.162 --> 00:25:11.120
when he was in college.

00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:13.940
And afterwards he was
having dinner somewhere.

00:25:13.940 --> 00:25:19.540
And this woman came up to
him and said, I have been--

00:25:19.540 --> 00:25:20.680
I was at your talk.

00:25:20.680 --> 00:25:23.560
And his heart sank
because he immediately

00:25:23.560 --> 00:25:24.960
had a judgment about her.

00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:27.520
He thought, well, she's
probably really poorly educated

00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:29.305
and she doesn't look that smart.

00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:34.480
And then she said
to him, the thing

00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:37.330
is, I find reading Proust
in the original French much

00:25:37.330 --> 00:25:38.790
more fulfilling.

00:25:38.790 --> 00:25:44.340
And it was like, oh,
OK, there you go.

00:25:44.340 --> 00:25:46.390
You know, so it's actually
a tremendous sense

00:25:46.390 --> 00:25:51.610
of discovery and
exploration to experiment

00:25:51.610 --> 00:25:55.500
with how we pay attention
so that we can actually open

00:25:55.500 --> 00:25:58.850
and we can actually listen.

00:25:58.850 --> 00:26:01.190
And then the whole third
section of the book

00:26:01.190 --> 00:26:05.510
is about love for all beings
and love for life itself.

00:26:05.510 --> 00:26:10.070
And this is really interesting.

00:26:10.070 --> 00:26:12.410
In some ways it's
almost more interesting

00:26:12.410 --> 00:26:14.930
these days than it has been.

00:26:14.930 --> 00:26:19.260
It's very interesting,
and difficult, of course,

00:26:19.260 --> 00:26:22.390
and demands a tremendous
amount of understanding.

00:26:22.390 --> 00:26:23.790
Like, what do we mean?

00:26:23.790 --> 00:26:26.090
Do we mean complacency?

00:26:26.090 --> 00:26:27.420
Do we mean compliance?

00:26:27.420 --> 00:26:29.390
Do we mean acquiescence?

00:26:29.390 --> 00:26:33.810
Do we mean kind of liberated
understanding that's

00:26:33.810 --> 00:26:37.350
not so afraid, that
isn't holding ourselves

00:26:37.350 --> 00:26:42.400
or others in a kind of
prison of certainty?

00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:44.180
What do we mean?

00:26:44.180 --> 00:26:46.930
Because certainly, if it
means liking everybody,

00:26:46.930 --> 00:26:48.590
that makes no sense.

00:26:48.590 --> 00:26:51.000
In fact, the last
group that I did,

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:54.010
as I was trying to
collect people's stories

00:26:54.010 --> 00:27:00.710
and things like that, somebody
said to me, in my life,

00:27:00.710 --> 00:27:03.110
it was always said,
or it was just

00:27:03.110 --> 00:27:07.515
the assumption that
loving somebody was

00:27:07.515 --> 00:27:15.190
a supreme, rare, rarefied,
precious, unusual way

00:27:15.190 --> 00:27:17.672
of relating, whereas
you liked everybody.

00:27:17.672 --> 00:27:18.880
I mean, you just like people.

00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:19.705
It's much lower.

00:27:22.270 --> 00:27:24.349
And he said, you're
reversing it.

00:27:24.349 --> 00:27:25.390
You're turning it around.

00:27:25.390 --> 00:27:27.181
You're saying, yeah,
we can love everybody,

00:27:27.181 --> 00:27:30.450
but liking somebody,
that's rare, perhaps.

00:27:30.450 --> 00:27:31.330
I thought about it.

00:27:31.330 --> 00:27:34.000
And I said, you're right, I am.

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:35.860
Because it's not love
in the sense of I

00:27:35.860 --> 00:27:37.640
want to spend tremendous
time with you,

00:27:37.640 --> 00:27:39.130
I want to spend
my life with you.

00:27:39.130 --> 00:27:40.060
It's not romance.

00:27:40.060 --> 00:27:46.420
It's not even saying, yeah,
let's go to the movies,

00:27:46.420 --> 00:27:46.920
you know?

00:27:46.920 --> 00:27:53.270
It's that fundamental sense
of acknowledging connection

00:27:53.270 --> 00:27:54.950
and realizing we're
kind of all in this

00:27:54.950 --> 00:27:57.500
together, like we're
all the traffic.

00:27:57.500 --> 00:28:00.459
That's love as the way
I'm using the word.

00:28:00.459 --> 00:28:02.000
And you may not like
somebody at all.

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:05.960
And you may decide,
you know what, it's not

00:28:05.960 --> 00:28:09.691
in the sense of a balanced kind
of compassion including myself,

00:28:09.691 --> 00:28:11.690
it's not in the cards
right now that we're going

00:28:11.690 --> 00:28:12.960
to spend any time together.

00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:14.420
That's just not right.

00:28:14.420 --> 00:28:18.350
Or my best guess of the most
appropriate way, the most

00:28:18.350 --> 00:28:22.040
skillful way to relate in this
moment is strong boundaries.

00:28:22.040 --> 00:28:25.880
It's kind of a fierce message.

00:28:25.880 --> 00:28:27.480
It's tough love.

00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:29.120
There's all kinds
of possibilities

00:28:29.120 --> 00:28:33.110
in terms of how we
actualize our relationship.

00:28:33.110 --> 00:28:37.820
But that inner sense
of feeling, OK, we're

00:28:37.820 --> 00:28:40.280
kind of all in this
together, what's it like?

00:28:40.280 --> 00:28:42.246
What would it be like to be you?

00:28:42.246 --> 00:28:47.350
To translate some
difficult actions

00:28:47.350 --> 00:28:51.940
into actions that are produced
by pain, that cause more

00:28:51.940 --> 00:28:53.920
pain and suffering, you know?

00:28:53.920 --> 00:28:57.970
To really stretch, to examine
and be creative about the ways

00:28:57.970 --> 00:28:59.350
that we relate.

00:28:59.350 --> 00:29:05.780
Openness to the possibility
of loving everybody,

00:29:05.780 --> 00:29:07.670
even if we don't like
everyone very much.

00:29:07.670 --> 00:29:09.950
So I also tell this
story in the book

00:29:09.950 --> 00:29:16.100
about once spending time with
this man named Myles Horton who

00:29:16.100 --> 00:29:19.490
founded a school many years
ago called the Highlander Folk

00:29:19.490 --> 00:29:19.994
School--

00:29:19.994 --> 00:29:22.160
I think it still exists,
but it has a different name

00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:23.360
now-- in Tennessee.

00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:25.610
But it was like a training
school for the civil rights

00:29:25.610 --> 00:29:30.365
movement in the US and the very
early environmental movement.

00:29:32.900 --> 00:29:37.340
So we ended up-- he and I end
up spending a day together.

00:29:37.340 --> 00:29:41.480
And I talked to him about
loving-kindness meditation.

00:29:41.480 --> 00:29:43.670
And he sort of snorted at me.

00:29:43.670 --> 00:29:45.380
And he said, oh, Marty--

00:29:45.380 --> 00:29:47.230
Martin Luther King, Jr.--

00:29:47.230 --> 00:29:48.980
Marty used to say
to me all the time,

00:29:48.980 --> 00:29:50.780
you got to love everybody.

00:29:50.780 --> 00:29:52.730
And I used to say, no, I don't.

00:29:52.730 --> 00:29:56.000
I only have to love the people
that deserve to be loved.

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:58.150
And Marty would laugh
and say, no, you've

00:29:58.150 --> 00:30:00.860
got to love everybody.

00:30:00.860 --> 00:30:04.440
And prior to this book, I
so rarely told that story.

00:30:04.440 --> 00:30:07.950
But I remember that
every time I told

00:30:07.950 --> 00:30:11.220
the story, somebody
would come back at me

00:30:11.220 --> 00:30:13.890
and say something like, look
what happened to him, you know?

00:30:13.890 --> 00:30:15.660
He got assassinated.

00:30:15.660 --> 00:30:18.840
As though it was the love
that weakened him, right?

00:30:18.840 --> 00:30:23.940
And if he'd been vicious and
angry and hostile and hateful,

00:30:23.940 --> 00:30:25.950
he would have been safe.

00:30:25.950 --> 00:30:28.560
He wouldn't have been vulnerable
to anyone else's actions.

00:30:28.560 --> 00:30:34.640
And I think that projection of
causality is very interesting.

00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:36.090
Look at that.

00:30:36.090 --> 00:30:39.220
So the fundamental question
is, what do we think love is?

00:30:39.220 --> 00:30:41.410
And does it bring us down?

00:30:41.410 --> 00:30:42.890
Does it make us stupid?

00:30:42.890 --> 00:30:44.980
Does it make us sentimental?

00:30:44.980 --> 00:30:47.650
Or can it be this
kind of clarifying

00:30:47.650 --> 00:30:51.880
vision of, really, the
way the world actually is

00:30:51.880 --> 00:30:55.117
and how we can respond to it?

00:30:55.117 --> 00:30:57.200
So how about if we sit
together for a few minutes.

00:30:57.200 --> 00:30:59.241
And then we'll just have
some time for questions.

00:31:03.530 --> 00:31:07.520
So since I introduced it
as my first technique,

00:31:07.520 --> 00:31:11.000
we can also go back there.

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:14.630
And I'd say, see if you
can settle your attention

00:31:14.630 --> 00:31:16.840
on the feeling of
the breath, just

00:31:16.840 --> 00:31:21.000
the normal, natural breath,
however it's appearing for you.

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:24.050
You don't have to try to
make it deeper or different.

00:31:24.050 --> 00:31:26.480
And watch your
mind at the moment

00:31:26.480 --> 00:31:30.860
that you realize you're thinking
about dinner or your vacation

00:31:30.860 --> 00:31:31.790
or whatever it is.

00:31:34.900 --> 00:31:37.890
See how you speak to yourself.

00:31:37.890 --> 00:31:40.260
And if that is a
pretty harsh voice--

00:31:40.260 --> 00:31:42.786
kind of punitive or belittling--

00:31:42.786 --> 00:31:46.340
you can recognize that.

00:31:46.340 --> 00:31:50.990
See if you can
soften that response.

00:31:50.990 --> 00:31:54.040
Remember that our goal is to
just let go and begin again.

00:31:54.040 --> 00:31:55.930
If you have to do that
billions of times,

00:31:55.930 --> 00:31:57.611
that doesn't mean
you're doing it wrong.

00:31:57.611 --> 00:31:58.360
You're doing fine.

00:32:02.390 --> 00:32:03.960
OK, so you can
just find the place

00:32:03.960 --> 00:32:07.890
where the breath is clearest
for you or strongest for you.

00:32:07.890 --> 00:32:12.352
Maybe that's the nostrils,
or the chest, or the abdomen.

00:32:12.352 --> 00:32:14.060
Bring your attention
there and just rest.

00:32:19.640 --> 00:32:20.990
See if you can feel one breath.

00:32:40.620 --> 00:32:42.900
Remember, the most
important moment

00:32:42.900 --> 00:32:46.237
is the moment after
you've been distracted,

00:32:46.237 --> 00:32:47.195
after you've been lost.

00:33:18.030 --> 00:33:20.760
No matter how many times you may
have to let go and begin again,

00:33:20.760 --> 00:33:22.125
it's not a problem.

00:33:22.125 --> 00:33:23.250
That's the point, actually.

00:37:08.820 --> 00:37:16.280
And I'll close with this
passage from the book.

00:37:16.280 --> 00:37:19.100
"Today, with unprecedented
threats to our planet

00:37:19.100 --> 00:37:21.980
and divisions among
people, awareness

00:37:21.980 --> 00:37:25.650
of our interdependence
is no longer optional.

00:37:25.650 --> 00:37:27.620
It's critical that we
widen our attention

00:37:27.620 --> 00:37:31.470
to include those we encounter
as we go about our daily lives,

00:37:31.470 --> 00:37:34.520
including our dry cleaner and
the stranger sitting next to us

00:37:34.520 --> 00:37:36.530
on the subway.

00:37:36.530 --> 00:37:38.000
"We extend our
sense of inclusion

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:41.990
even further to people we
may have disagreements with,

00:37:41.990 --> 00:37:44.990
people whose actions
we disapprove of,

00:37:44.990 --> 00:37:49.310
even those who may have harmed
us or those we care for.

00:37:49.310 --> 00:37:51.480
We don't have to like
what they've done,

00:37:51.480 --> 00:37:53.360
and we might take
very strong action

00:37:53.360 --> 00:37:56.950
to try to prevent they're
doing it ever again.

00:37:56.950 --> 00:37:59.740
But as our experiences of
the universality of suffering

00:37:59.740 --> 00:38:02.170
grows, our sense
of interconnection

00:38:02.170 --> 00:38:05.620
deepens, and we begin to
wish others could be free

00:38:05.620 --> 00:38:08.600
in a new way, in spite
of their actions,

00:38:08.600 --> 00:38:10.870
their beliefs, or their
positions in the world.

00:38:14.540 --> 00:38:15.350
So thank you.

00:38:18.224 --> 00:38:19.182
So thank you.

00:38:19.182 --> 00:38:23.014
[APPLAUSE]

00:38:24.451 --> 00:38:26.970
SPEAKER: And we'll open
it up to questions.

00:38:26.970 --> 00:38:28.980
So does anyone in the
room want to start us off

00:38:28.980 --> 00:38:30.850
with a question?

00:38:30.850 --> 00:38:32.190
AUDIENCE: Oh, wow.

00:38:32.190 --> 00:38:33.300
What is love?

00:38:33.300 --> 00:38:34.800
SHARON SALZBERG:
You don't have to--

00:38:34.800 --> 00:38:36.837
AUDIENCE: Well, no-- I
mean, my guess would be--

00:38:36.837 --> 00:38:38.670
or my interpretation
might be like that kind

00:38:38.670 --> 00:38:41.190
of unconditional acceptance
of self and other,

00:38:41.190 --> 00:38:43.460
like you were suggesting.

00:38:43.460 --> 00:38:45.380
Or compatible with
what you described.

00:38:45.380 --> 00:38:45.880
I'm curious.

00:38:45.880 --> 00:38:49.030
So you know, I think
about here at Google,

00:38:49.030 --> 00:38:54.117
we have a kind of pragmatic kind
of problem-solving approach.

00:38:54.117 --> 00:38:56.700
You know, when we see a problem,
when we see metrics at Search

00:38:56.700 --> 00:38:59.190
or whatever, we
try to understand,

00:38:59.190 --> 00:39:01.111
OK, this is what the problem--

00:39:01.111 --> 00:39:02.610
here are the details
of the problem,

00:39:02.610 --> 00:39:04.651
and then brainstorm
different possible solutions.

00:39:04.651 --> 00:39:06.660
SHARON SALZBERG: Yeah.

00:39:06.660 --> 00:39:09.480
AUDIENCE: And so what I'm
hearing you say, you're

00:39:09.480 --> 00:39:14.460
describing these kinds of
states or qualities of awareness

00:39:14.460 --> 00:39:18.745
in terms of a kind
of acceptance,

00:39:18.745 --> 00:39:21.170
a kind of interconnectedness.

00:39:21.170 --> 00:39:23.820
And so these other kinds of
aspects to-- or qualities

00:39:23.820 --> 00:39:24.660
of our experience.

00:39:24.660 --> 00:39:26.880
And then you're also
distinguishing breathing

00:39:26.880 --> 00:39:29.130
meditation as a technique
that guides us to that,

00:39:29.130 --> 00:39:31.640
or loving-kindness meditation.

00:39:31.640 --> 00:39:34.461
Do you see-- are
those like the only--

00:39:34.461 --> 00:39:36.210
so this is what I'm
trying to tease apart.

00:39:36.210 --> 00:39:38.190
It's like, are those
the only practices

00:39:38.190 --> 00:39:41.070
that can guide us to
those kinds of states

00:39:41.070 --> 00:39:42.379
of consciousness or awareness?

00:39:42.379 --> 00:39:44.170
SHARON SALZBERG: No,
I think those are far,

00:39:44.170 --> 00:39:46.980
far from the only practices
that guide us to that.

00:39:46.980 --> 00:39:52.130
I mean, there are obviously
interactive practices, I mean.

00:39:52.130 --> 00:39:54.069
You know, there's
that, as an example--

00:39:54.069 --> 00:39:56.110
if you're talking about
reflection and meditation

00:39:56.110 --> 00:39:57.680
and many others as well.

00:39:57.680 --> 00:39:59.680
But you know, as part of
Search Inside Yourself,

00:39:59.680 --> 00:40:05.790
it's just like me, which is that
intentional looking at someone

00:40:05.790 --> 00:40:09.140
else and recognizing, oh,
that's a person just like me,

00:40:09.140 --> 00:40:10.740
wants to be happy
just like me, who

00:40:10.740 --> 00:40:16.170
has maybe backaches just like
me, or whatever it might be.

00:40:16.170 --> 00:40:20.310
There are ways we learn to look
at one another differently.

00:40:20.310 --> 00:40:23.520
Certainly, there are ways we
learn to listen, you know,

00:40:23.520 --> 00:40:26.598
which are actual disciplines
in communication.

00:40:26.598 --> 00:40:30.960
And there are many.

00:40:30.960 --> 00:40:35.650
There's so many ways
of looking at what

00:40:35.650 --> 00:40:40.690
may be a kind of manufactured
sense of limitation

00:40:40.690 --> 00:40:46.210
and being able to dissolve that
into seeing things differently.

00:40:46.210 --> 00:40:48.085
AUDIENCE: In terms of
separation or scarcity.

00:40:48.085 --> 00:40:49.001
SHARON SALZBERG: Yeah.

00:40:49.001 --> 00:40:50.140
Yeah, exactly.

00:40:50.140 --> 00:40:52.750
AUDIENCE: So I'll ask
you to do a follow-up

00:40:52.750 --> 00:40:55.060
question about that
of, how do you suggest

00:40:55.060 --> 00:40:58.030
people choose or decide?

00:40:58.030 --> 00:41:00.072
Or is it-- do you
just encourage--

00:41:00.072 --> 00:41:02.530
do you encourage people to try
out the different techniques

00:41:02.530 --> 00:41:04.044
or give other guidance for that?

00:41:04.044 --> 00:41:04.960
SHARON SALZBERG: Yeah.

00:41:04.960 --> 00:41:07.810
I mean, I think if
you're in a place,

00:41:07.810 --> 00:41:10.420
as you are here,
where there actually

00:41:10.420 --> 00:41:15.640
can be both a sense of community
exploration and guidance.

00:41:15.640 --> 00:41:19.450
Because one of the great
hindrances people face

00:41:19.450 --> 00:41:21.400
is their expectations.

00:41:21.400 --> 00:41:24.490
And to have a voice,
however it comes,

00:41:24.490 --> 00:41:28.450
to say, wait a minute, it's
OK that your mind wandered,

00:41:28.450 --> 00:41:30.020
for example.

00:41:30.020 --> 00:41:32.920
Which is one of the great
bugaboos of meditation practice

00:41:32.920 --> 00:41:37.570
is people who feel utterly
aghast that their mind--

00:41:37.570 --> 00:41:39.370
that they had a
thought, you know?

00:41:39.370 --> 00:41:42.530
Because they think that's
not supposed to happen.

00:41:42.530 --> 00:41:43.460
I failed.

00:41:43.460 --> 00:41:45.370
I mean, countless
people say to me

00:41:45.370 --> 00:41:47.350
if I'm introduced as
a meditation teacher,

00:41:47.350 --> 00:41:50.630
oh, I tried that
once, I failed at it.

00:41:50.630 --> 00:41:53.040
Well, what happened, actually?

00:41:53.040 --> 00:41:55.350
You know, so I
believe in structure

00:41:55.350 --> 00:41:58.530
and that kind of learning just
to have a sense of context.

00:41:58.530 --> 00:42:00.139
Like, there's a
body of knowledge,

00:42:00.139 --> 00:42:01.930
and you are in a place
where you can access

00:42:01.930 --> 00:42:04.860
that body of knowledge here.

00:42:04.860 --> 00:42:07.840
And that's all, you
know, is to have that.

00:42:07.840 --> 00:42:09.721
And then the rest,
it's interesting.

00:42:09.721 --> 00:42:10.470
It's like alchemy.

00:42:10.470 --> 00:42:12.680
Something has-- we
have to do something.

00:42:12.680 --> 00:42:14.190
It's not just fondly
thinking, these

00:42:14.190 --> 00:42:19.350
are good values to live by or
sometimes-- it hasn't happened.

00:42:19.350 --> 00:42:22.050
My book is actually not out yet.

00:42:22.050 --> 00:42:23.130
It's coming out June 6.

00:42:23.130 --> 00:42:25.920
So it hasn't happened
yet, but many times,

00:42:25.920 --> 00:42:28.140
because of meditation
practices and techniques in all

00:42:28.140 --> 00:42:32.550
of my books, people
say to me, I'm

00:42:32.550 --> 00:42:35.550
buying your book for my cousin.

00:42:35.550 --> 00:42:39.510
I could never do this, you
know, but they really need it.

00:42:39.510 --> 00:42:42.330
You know, they're
so stressed out.

00:42:42.330 --> 00:42:45.800
So what is that sense of
separation from actually

00:42:45.800 --> 00:42:47.079
putting it into practice?

00:42:47.079 --> 00:42:49.370
That's the hardest part is
saying, oh, it's a practice,

00:42:49.370 --> 00:42:51.680
or it's a series of practices.

00:42:51.680 --> 00:42:54.660
And that means application
and exploration.

00:42:54.660 --> 00:42:58.056
And it means continuity,
because it's not always

00:42:58.056 --> 00:42:59.180
going to be easy, you know?

00:42:59.180 --> 00:43:04.437
So if you're willing to do that,
then I think it all happens.

00:43:04.437 --> 00:43:05.520
AUDIENCE: My question is--

00:43:05.520 --> 00:43:08.500
I'm a little reluctant to
say because it's not well

00:43:08.500 --> 00:43:09.660
formulated in my head.

00:43:09.660 --> 00:43:13.500
But I'm thinking about
parent and children.

00:43:13.500 --> 00:43:17.400
I'm having a conversation
with my 23-year-old son today.

00:43:17.400 --> 00:43:19.170
And I'm going to
stretch and have

00:43:19.170 --> 00:43:22.180
a different kind of approach
after listening to you.

00:43:22.180 --> 00:43:24.690
But thinking about
love in terms of--

00:43:30.030 --> 00:43:34.500
the love as you're describing
is connection and not feeling

00:43:34.500 --> 00:43:35.410
separate.

00:43:35.410 --> 00:43:38.460
But in relationships,
particularly with parents

00:43:38.460 --> 00:43:39.510
and children that--

00:43:42.720 --> 00:43:46.050
how would you-- what would be
the proper way of describing

00:43:46.050 --> 00:43:50.220
love where you are
acknowledge the separateness

00:43:50.220 --> 00:43:53.490
that we are separate,
there are no expectations,

00:43:53.490 --> 00:43:54.400
you're not mine?

00:43:54.400 --> 00:43:54.970
SHARON SALZBERG:
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:43:54.970 --> 00:43:55.830
Yeah, yeah.

00:43:55.830 --> 00:44:00.030
Well, I don't know that I
said or meant to say we're not

00:44:00.030 --> 00:44:01.740
separate, we're not isolated.

00:44:01.740 --> 00:44:03.120
You know, we're
not kind of bound

00:44:03.120 --> 00:44:07.020
in this rigid
sense of exclusion.

00:44:07.020 --> 00:44:08.940
But certainly, we're
separate, which

00:44:08.940 --> 00:44:14.190
is why a true state of
love might sometimes

00:44:14.190 --> 00:44:15.720
mean strong boundaries.

00:44:15.720 --> 00:44:17.857
Or it might mean,
you know, no, I'm

00:44:17.857 --> 00:44:20.190
not giving you any more money,
or no, you can't move in,

00:44:20.190 --> 00:44:22.080
or whatever.

00:44:22.080 --> 00:44:23.910
We're not going to
spend any time together.

00:44:23.910 --> 00:44:26.892
Of course we're
separate in those ways.

00:44:26.892 --> 00:44:27.600
And you're right.

00:44:27.600 --> 00:44:31.650
It's a complicated, intricate,
amazing kind of relationship.

00:44:31.650 --> 00:44:34.170
Well, also in that
first group that I

00:44:34.170 --> 00:44:38.820
did where the man said he
and his dog were 100-100,

00:44:38.820 --> 00:44:41.100
somebody was talking
about her relationship

00:44:41.100 --> 00:44:44.340
with her son, who I think was
about the same age as your son.

00:44:44.340 --> 00:44:48.780
And she said, I think your book
should be called "Real Love--

00:44:48.780 --> 00:44:50.406
Simple, But Not Easy."

00:44:50.406 --> 00:44:52.380
Because you know, it's not easy.

00:44:55.220 --> 00:45:01.130
There's a certain-- it's like
a funny combination, I think,

00:45:01.130 --> 00:45:06.500
of loving and
letting go, which is

00:45:06.500 --> 00:45:12.590
the hallmark of a relationship
with an adult child.

00:45:12.590 --> 00:45:15.780
And it's funny, I was doing a
Skype session with a friend.

00:45:15.780 --> 00:45:18.970
I was on the east coast and
they were in California.

00:45:18.970 --> 00:45:24.020
It was a friend's yoga
teacher training group.

00:45:24.020 --> 00:45:27.950
And I was talking about
within the Buddhist tradition,

00:45:27.950 --> 00:45:30.350
there's this term
called equanimity, which

00:45:30.350 --> 00:45:31.610
doesn't mean indifference.

00:45:31.610 --> 00:45:35.090
It doesn't mean
coldness or withdrawal.

00:45:35.090 --> 00:45:37.570
It means balance.

00:45:37.570 --> 00:45:39.070
And it's the balance
born of wisdom.

00:45:39.070 --> 00:45:41.240
It's like perspective.

00:45:41.240 --> 00:45:45.200
In any compassionate act,
or the examples often used

00:45:45.200 --> 00:45:48.920
in that tradition of a
parent with an adult child,

00:45:48.920 --> 00:45:52.910
you know, you love them,
you care about them,

00:45:52.910 --> 00:45:55.970
you're on their side, you want
things to go well for them.

00:45:55.970 --> 00:45:59.077
And you can't make their
decisions for them.

00:45:59.077 --> 00:46:00.910
You can't say, well,
this is your livelihood

00:46:00.910 --> 00:46:01.970
and this is your partner.

00:46:01.970 --> 00:46:04.160
This is, you know,
your course of life.

00:46:04.160 --> 00:46:06.110
Life is not like that.

00:46:06.110 --> 00:46:08.840
And so it's not
apathy or rejection.

00:46:08.840 --> 00:46:15.270
But it's a kind of understanding
that gives us a sense of space,

00:46:15.270 --> 00:46:17.070
like being able to breathe.

00:46:17.070 --> 00:46:19.800
So it's a combination of the
love and compassion, and also

00:46:19.800 --> 00:46:21.284
that kind of openness.

00:46:21.284 --> 00:46:22.950
So apparently there
were a lot of people

00:46:22.950 --> 00:46:27.180
in this room in that yoga
teacher training program

00:46:27.180 --> 00:46:28.900
who had young children.

00:46:28.900 --> 00:46:31.710
And they were clamoring to say,
it's like that with young kids,

00:46:31.710 --> 00:46:32.397
too.

00:46:32.397 --> 00:46:34.230
You know, it's not just
when they're adults.

00:46:34.230 --> 00:46:36.020
It's just like that.

00:46:36.020 --> 00:46:38.040
You know, so it's
kind of an extension

00:46:38.040 --> 00:46:40.050
of that understanding.

00:46:40.050 --> 00:46:42.427
And you know, sometimes
we're on one side,

00:46:42.427 --> 00:46:44.010
and sometimes we're
on the other side.

00:46:44.010 --> 00:46:45.870
And it's just being
aware of that.

00:46:45.870 --> 00:46:50.220
And learning how to communicate,
which is no easy feat anywhere.

00:46:50.220 --> 00:46:51.990
How do you communicate
to a colleague?

00:46:51.990 --> 00:46:55.170
How do you communicate to a
person you're supervising?

00:46:55.170 --> 00:46:59.280
Clearly, you know, there
are some tools that

00:46:59.280 --> 00:47:02.730
are kind of somewhat cliched,
maybe, your formulae,

00:47:02.730 --> 00:47:03.600
but actually work.

00:47:03.600 --> 00:47:06.030
Like, you know, if you're
supervising someone,

00:47:06.030 --> 00:47:08.670
it's not that useful to
say, you're an idiot.

00:47:08.670 --> 00:47:10.350
It's much more
useful to say, well,

00:47:10.350 --> 00:47:12.922
when the memo six
weeks later, whatever.

00:47:12.922 --> 00:47:14.880
Because "you're an idiot"
actually doesn't even

00:47:14.880 --> 00:47:17.250
give that person the
information they need should

00:47:17.250 --> 00:47:19.320
they want to change, right?

00:47:19.320 --> 00:47:22.130
So we learn how to
communicate in a way that

00:47:22.130 --> 00:47:26.370
is more expressive of, OK,
being on the same side,

00:47:26.370 --> 00:47:27.180
wanting you to--

00:47:27.180 --> 00:47:28.014
AUDIENCE: Respect.

00:47:28.014 --> 00:47:28.930
SHARON SALZBERG: Yeah.

00:47:28.930 --> 00:47:31.330
Yeah.

00:47:31.330 --> 00:47:32.577
Simple, but not easy.

00:47:32.577 --> 00:47:33.160
SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:47:33.160 --> 00:47:35.470
Question over here?

00:47:35.470 --> 00:47:37.930
AUDIENCE: Do you think
love or connection

00:47:37.930 --> 00:47:39.280
can happen without empathy?

00:47:43.920 --> 00:47:46.140
SHARON SALZBERG: Can it
happen without empathy?

00:47:46.140 --> 00:47:47.890
AUDIENCE: Can you have
it without empathy?

00:47:47.890 --> 00:47:50.830
It seems like empathy is
such a key part, which

00:47:50.830 --> 00:47:52.390
is part of compassion.

00:47:52.390 --> 00:47:55.424
But I didn't really hear
you use the word empathy.

00:47:55.424 --> 00:47:57.840
SHARON SALZBERG: No, I didn't
use the word empathy at all.

00:48:00.790 --> 00:48:04.270
I think empathy is in there
somewhere along the way,

00:48:04.270 --> 00:48:05.590
for sure.

00:48:05.590 --> 00:48:09.700
We would say that empathy is
like an essential building

00:48:09.700 --> 00:48:12.790
block for, say, a
state of compassion.

00:48:12.790 --> 00:48:15.070
But it's also not
considered sufficient

00:48:15.070 --> 00:48:17.490
for a state of compassion.

00:48:17.490 --> 00:48:23.630
Because as you may have a
kind of moment of empathy

00:48:23.630 --> 00:48:25.580
towards someone's situation--

00:48:25.580 --> 00:48:28.360
let's say they're having a
hard time and you sense that,

00:48:28.360 --> 00:48:31.890
and you feel that, you
resonate with that.

00:48:31.890 --> 00:48:34.520
You might genuinely have
that moment of empathy,

00:48:34.520 --> 00:48:36.750
but then respond with fear.

00:48:36.750 --> 00:48:39.210
Or with you're just
exhausted, and you think,

00:48:39.210 --> 00:48:42.570
I'm so burnt out, I
can't possibly deal.

00:48:42.570 --> 00:48:45.210
Or you might be
blaming, you know?

00:48:45.210 --> 00:48:47.320
I gave you perfectly good
advice six months ago.

00:48:47.320 --> 00:48:49.590
If you only listened,
you'd be better off.

00:48:49.590 --> 00:48:53.580
Or in the state of
compassion, you know,

00:48:53.580 --> 00:48:57.910
it also might get blurred with
that kind of savior mentality.

00:48:57.910 --> 00:49:01.560
Like, I'm going to be the
one who's going to fix you.

00:49:01.560 --> 00:49:04.524
Or we might respond with
compassion and loving-kindness.

00:49:04.524 --> 00:49:06.190
So there are a lot
of elements in there,

00:49:06.190 --> 00:49:08.430
but I think empathy
is essential.

00:49:08.430 --> 00:49:12.120
AUDIENCE: OK, it sounds like
empathy isn't as sustaining.

00:49:12.120 --> 00:49:14.190
Deeper is compassion.

00:49:14.190 --> 00:49:17.010
SHARON SALZBERG: I think
it's different, you know?

00:49:17.010 --> 00:49:19.740
So in psychological
research, they

00:49:19.740 --> 00:49:21.290
say that we might--
the way they put

00:49:21.290 --> 00:49:23.040
it is we might have
this state of empathy,

00:49:23.040 --> 00:49:24.840
and we need this
state of empathy.

00:49:24.840 --> 00:49:25.580
We do need it.

00:49:25.580 --> 00:49:27.090
You're right.

00:49:27.090 --> 00:49:29.500
But we might over-identify
with the other person.

00:49:29.500 --> 00:49:33.030
So it's not like we're
looking at them thinking,

00:49:33.030 --> 00:49:35.700
I can sense what it
might be like for you.

00:49:35.700 --> 00:49:37.380
It's like we're there.

00:49:37.380 --> 00:49:40.140
And then it's like we're going
down with the ship, you know?

00:49:40.140 --> 00:49:45.370
So they say that empathy leads
to empathic distress, where

00:49:45.370 --> 00:49:49.140
our own feeling of being
overwhelmed with negativity

00:49:49.140 --> 00:49:50.580
is what's taken over.

00:49:50.580 --> 00:49:51.960
So there's not
room for that kind

00:49:51.960 --> 00:49:56.339
of generosity and stability
of the loving response.

00:49:56.339 --> 00:49:56.880
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:49:56.880 --> 00:49:57.838
Yeah, that makes sense.

00:49:57.838 --> 00:49:58.980
Thank you.

00:49:58.980 --> 00:49:59.940
One last question.

00:49:59.940 --> 00:50:02.344
It sounds like you've
done vipassana meditation.

00:50:02.344 --> 00:50:03.510
SHARON SALZBERG: Yeah, yeah.

00:50:03.510 --> 00:50:03.850
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:50:03.850 --> 00:50:04.891
And you studied in Burma.

00:50:04.891 --> 00:50:09.750
And is a lot of this book
based on the attributes

00:50:09.750 --> 00:50:11.814
and the learnings of vipassana?

00:50:11.814 --> 00:50:13.230
SHARON SALZBERG:
Well, vipassana--

00:50:13.230 --> 00:50:15.135
I mean, it's kind of a
complicated question.

00:50:15.135 --> 00:50:18.131
Vipassana's a term
in Pali, the language

00:50:18.131 --> 00:50:19.380
of the original Buddhist text.

00:50:19.380 --> 00:50:20.730
It means insight medi--

00:50:20.730 --> 00:50:21.660
it means insight.

00:50:21.660 --> 00:50:24.540
So vipassana meditation
is insight meditation.

00:50:24.540 --> 00:50:27.450
And there are many, many,
many strands and techniques

00:50:27.450 --> 00:50:30.930
and traditions and
lineages within that.

00:50:30.930 --> 00:50:36.010
Goenka-- S.N. Goenka,
who was my first teacher,

00:50:36.010 --> 00:50:43.210
was kind of an early
teacher in modern time

00:50:43.210 --> 00:50:45.850
outside of Burma, which
was a very closed country.

00:50:45.850 --> 00:50:50.439
When I first went to India, you
could go to Burma for 24 hours.

00:50:50.439 --> 00:50:52.230
But he had left Burma,
and he was in India.

00:50:52.230 --> 00:50:56.620
So he called his particular
style, his particular technique

00:50:56.620 --> 00:50:57.330
vipassana.

00:50:57.330 --> 00:51:00.070
So even-- it has a
much broader meaning,

00:51:00.070 --> 00:51:03.620
but most people identify it with
that one way of practice, so.

00:51:03.620 --> 00:51:06.220
And when I went to Burma, it
wasn't within his tradition.

00:51:06.220 --> 00:51:09.370
I was studying with
other people by then.

00:51:09.370 --> 00:51:14.230
But he was my first teacher,
so it was a hugely important

00:51:14.230 --> 00:51:15.338
relationship.

00:51:15.338 --> 00:51:16.234
Yeah.

00:51:16.234 --> 00:51:17.130
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:51:17.130 --> 00:51:18.850
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

00:51:18.850 --> 00:51:21.760
Well, first, my definition
of what is love,

00:51:21.760 --> 00:51:23.110
I was thinking about that.

00:51:23.110 --> 00:51:26.190
I was like, I'd say it's--

00:51:26.190 --> 00:51:29.710
so I think what I'm thinking
is just self-acceptance

00:51:29.710 --> 00:51:31.080
of all wholeness.

00:51:31.080 --> 00:51:34.780
So like my dark
sides, my light sides,

00:51:34.780 --> 00:51:38.140
everything from the past to
the present and what will be.

00:51:38.140 --> 00:51:39.790
And that's-- and it isn't easy.

00:51:39.790 --> 00:51:43.390
So that's my definition.

00:51:43.390 --> 00:51:46.040
So my question is just
around the term love.

00:51:46.040 --> 00:51:48.220
So you-- I liked what you
said about Bob Thurman.

00:51:48.220 --> 00:51:50.875
And Bob Thurman is coming here,
by the way, on September 12.

00:51:50.875 --> 00:51:52.000
SHARON SALZBERG: Oh, great.

00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:53.420
AUDIENCE: In this room, I think.

00:51:53.420 --> 00:51:53.920
Yeah.

00:51:53.920 --> 00:51:56.660
So he's talking about his new
book called "Man of Peace,"

00:51:56.660 --> 00:51:59.090
about the Dalai Lama.

00:51:59.090 --> 00:52:03.342
So my question was
around the word,

00:52:03.342 --> 00:52:05.050
because I think there's
a lot of triggers

00:52:05.050 --> 00:52:06.589
with love and loving-kindness.

00:52:06.589 --> 00:52:08.380
I like the abbreviation
of just using love.

00:52:08.380 --> 00:52:11.229
I'm going to start
using that too.

00:52:11.229 --> 00:52:12.520
But do you think it's overused?

00:52:12.520 --> 00:52:12.855
Because--

00:52:12.855 --> 00:52:13.450
SHARON SALZBERG: Love?

00:52:13.450 --> 00:52:16.060
AUDIENCE: Yeah, the word
love, in terms of-- my thought

00:52:16.060 --> 00:52:18.987
is it loses meaning over time,
like anything if you just

00:52:18.987 --> 00:52:19.820
say it all the time.

00:52:19.820 --> 00:52:21.670
So how do you know--
like, if I love you,

00:52:21.670 --> 00:52:23.020
it's like-- is that the same?

00:52:23.020 --> 00:52:24.800
Or can you share
more about that?

00:52:24.800 --> 00:52:26.200
Because I'm always struggling--

00:52:26.200 --> 00:52:28.241
I don't want to say love
unless it's really real.

00:52:28.241 --> 00:52:31.444
But at the same time,
I want to express.

00:52:31.444 --> 00:52:32.110
So what do I do?

00:52:32.110 --> 00:52:34.115
Or what can we do?

00:52:34.115 --> 00:52:36.240
SHARON SALZBERG: We can
call it real love, I guess.

00:52:36.240 --> 00:52:38.032
AUDIENCE: I'll
just say real love.

00:52:38.032 --> 00:52:39.740
SHARON SALZBERG: No,
it's very difficult.

00:52:39.740 --> 00:52:40.739
Of course it's overused.

00:52:40.739 --> 00:52:49.200
You know, I love my
manicure, I love my lamp,

00:52:49.200 --> 00:52:50.880
I love my new car, sort of.

00:52:50.880 --> 00:52:55.080
Not totally, but I
would have loved it more

00:52:55.080 --> 00:52:56.950
if it was the other
color that I asked for,

00:52:56.950 --> 00:52:59.590
but it was the second choice.

00:52:59.590 --> 00:53:00.460
But I still love it.

00:53:00.460 --> 00:53:03.930
You know, so of course we
use it in so many ways.

00:53:03.930 --> 00:53:11.740
I think that in looking back
over my work in the world and--

00:53:11.740 --> 00:53:13.150
now this is my 10th book--

00:53:13.150 --> 00:53:15.220
I realized that something
that fascinates me

00:53:15.220 --> 00:53:21.740
and that has moved me a lot has
actually been redeeming words,

00:53:21.740 --> 00:53:25.760
that so many words
get kind of denigrated

00:53:25.760 --> 00:53:31.070
or used in strange ways
or take on new meanings.

00:53:31.070 --> 00:53:33.780
And I think we lose something
when we lose the word.

00:53:33.780 --> 00:53:35.780
Like, I wrote a
book called "Faith."

00:53:35.780 --> 00:53:37.540
So that was a challenge.

00:53:37.540 --> 00:53:38.990
Even my friends were aghast.

00:53:38.990 --> 00:53:41.120
You know, like, why are
you writing a book on that?

00:53:41.120 --> 00:53:42.650
Because for so
many people, faith

00:53:42.650 --> 00:53:45.350
had come to mean
being silenced and not

00:53:45.350 --> 00:53:48.400
being able to ask questions and
not having a voice of your own.

00:53:48.400 --> 00:53:50.210
And of course, it
didn't mean that to me.

00:53:50.210 --> 00:53:54.550
And so I thought, OK, if we can
take back that word, we can--

00:53:54.550 --> 00:53:58.030
perhaps if it's meaningful to
someone in a different way.

00:53:58.030 --> 00:54:01.400
So I had a feeling I might be
doing something-- trying to do

00:54:01.400 --> 00:54:04.130
something like that with love.

00:54:04.130 --> 00:54:05.840
Because if we use it
in a certain way--

00:54:05.840 --> 00:54:09.140
not like I love my new
car, but not totally

00:54:09.140 --> 00:54:11.690
because it's the wrong color--

00:54:11.690 --> 00:54:16.862
then I think we recapture the
power of that in that way.

00:54:16.862 --> 00:54:18.570
AUDIENCE: When you
told the two stories--

00:54:18.570 --> 00:54:23.010
one about traffic and the other
about being on the airplane--

00:54:23.010 --> 00:54:24.330
what do you think--

00:54:24.330 --> 00:54:25.830
what do you think
it takes to get

00:54:25.830 --> 00:54:27.990
to where you have
those realizations

00:54:27.990 --> 00:54:30.489
on throughout the day, right?

00:54:30.489 --> 00:54:32.280
I know people use the
word triggered, which

00:54:32.280 --> 00:54:34.450
I'm starting to find overused.

00:54:34.450 --> 00:54:36.000
But you know, for you, or even--

00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:38.580
for you, I'm curious, and then
also advice for other people,

00:54:38.580 --> 00:54:39.080
right?

00:54:39.080 --> 00:54:42.360
How do you remember everybody
else exists and the other is

00:54:42.360 --> 00:54:45.074
not the other, and you know,
the situation is what it is.

00:54:45.074 --> 00:54:46.740
I mean, what does
that-- how does that--

00:54:46.740 --> 00:54:47.970
what do you think on that?

00:54:47.970 --> 00:54:50.390
SHARON SALZBERG: I think
the meditation exercise

00:54:50.390 --> 00:54:54.480
we did is like a fractal of the
whole path in that you won't

00:54:54.480 --> 00:54:57.730
remember throughout the day,
but you can begin again.

00:54:57.730 --> 00:54:58.490
Right?

00:54:58.490 --> 00:54:59.880
And I was talking about words.

00:54:59.880 --> 00:55:03.570
You know, like at the end of a
workshop, the end of a retreat,

00:55:03.570 --> 00:55:06.540
the end of a program,
people often say, well,

00:55:06.540 --> 00:55:09.640
how can I keep the level of
concentration I got here?

00:55:09.640 --> 00:55:12.600
How can I maintain the level
of mindfulness I got here?

00:55:12.600 --> 00:55:15.790
And my usual response is, you
won't, but you can start again,

00:55:15.790 --> 00:55:17.400
you can start again
more gracefully,

00:55:17.400 --> 00:55:21.495
you can start again with
less glue, you know?

00:55:21.495 --> 00:55:24.120
With better humor, with more
kindness towards yourself.

00:55:24.120 --> 00:55:25.900
You can start again sooner.

00:55:25.900 --> 00:55:27.480
And that's what happens.

00:55:27.480 --> 00:55:28.740
You know, of course we forget.

00:55:28.740 --> 00:55:29.970
I mean, we're just human beings.

00:55:29.970 --> 00:55:31.050
AUDIENCE: After
everything you've done

00:55:31.050 --> 00:55:32.730
and as long as you've
done this, do you

00:55:32.730 --> 00:55:34.439
feel some of that
comes naturally to you?

00:55:34.439 --> 00:55:35.521
SHARON SALZBERG: Oh, yeah.

00:55:35.521 --> 00:55:36.030
Yeah.

00:55:36.030 --> 00:55:41.630
But that doesn't mean every
moment of the day, you know?

00:55:41.630 --> 00:55:43.940
AUDIENCE: So assure us that
you have some bad moments.

00:55:43.940 --> 00:55:46.106
SHARON SALZBERG: I have
some bad moments, thank you.

00:55:46.106 --> 00:55:50.270
[LAUGHS] When I was,
a couple of trips

00:55:50.270 --> 00:55:53.780
ago, leaving San
Francisco for New York,

00:55:53.780 --> 00:55:56.530
my flight was 6
and 1/2 hours late.

00:55:56.530 --> 00:55:58.970
And I was fine for the
first 5 and 1/2 hours.

00:55:58.970 --> 00:56:01.496
I was like good humor,
sending loving-kindness

00:56:01.496 --> 00:56:02.870
throughout the
airport, you know?

00:56:02.870 --> 00:56:03.865
The whole thing.

00:56:03.865 --> 00:56:06.462
At hour 5 and 1/2, I
started to lose it.

00:56:06.462 --> 00:56:08.420
And just then, somebody
came up to me and said,

00:56:08.420 --> 00:56:11.780
are you Sharon Salzberg?

00:56:11.780 --> 00:56:15.350
I was so close to having a
temper tantrum on the ground,

00:56:15.350 --> 00:56:16.340
you know?

00:56:16.340 --> 00:56:18.820
SPEAKER: "You can start again"
is a great message, yeah.

00:56:18.820 --> 00:56:20.826
AUDIENCE: Sharon
Salzberg [INAUDIBLE]..

00:56:20.826 --> 00:56:21.950
SPEAKER: Thank you, Sharon.

00:56:21.950 --> 00:56:22.670
Thank you so much.

00:56:22.670 --> 00:56:22.970
SHARON SALZBERG: Thank you.

00:56:22.970 --> 00:56:23.870
Thank you.

00:56:23.870 --> 00:56:24.470
[APPLAUSE]

00:56:24.470 --> 00:56:26.620
Thank you for hosting me.
