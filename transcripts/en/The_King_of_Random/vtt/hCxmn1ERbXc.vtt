00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:13.220
There's no charge for this electricity. In
this project we're making a 40 watt hand cranked

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:15.920
generator from these common household items.

00:00:31.969 --> 00:00:36.120
For this project, let's see if we can make
an emergency cellphone charger out of a cordless

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.530
drill. I have a USB charger that charges this phone from a USB port, and we don't really

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:45.360
need the USB head, so let's go ahead and cut
that off, then use some wire strippers to

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.940
remove this outer layer. The shielding can
be pulled back, revealing the 4 wires inside.

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.530
I've done this to both ends of the cable,
and stripped the plastic from the ends of

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:59.660
the wires. Most phone batteries need around
5 volts to charge, and we can confirm that

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:03.739
by plugging the USB head into the port, and
attaching some alligator clips to the red

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:09.219
and black wires. Using a multi-meter, you
can see just over 5 volts of direct current.

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.110
With the phone in series, the circuit is completed
when these wires touch and the phone senses

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:19.080
power and lights up. This little black plug
symbol shows that it's charging, and it only

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:24.320
appears when the phone gets around 5 volts.
Ok, Let's build our make-shift phone charger.

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:29.200
I have a cordless drill I think I can convert
into an electrical generator by running it

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:34.060
backwards. I'll remove the bit, take the battery
out, and looking up into the handle, you can

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:38.630
see the two terminals where the battery would
connect. For testing, I'll attach alligator

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:43.180
clips to both of them, and then connect the
leads to my multi-meter. When I pull the trigger

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:47.560
and twist the rotating end of the drill I'm
generating around 5 volts, and that's what

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:52.640
we need. To make this into an emergency cell
phone charger, let's round up a piece of scrap

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:58.689
2x4, a wooden fork, a ball of yarn, a mixing
beater, a roll of tape, and some aluminum

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:03.070
foil. The first thing we'll need to do is
secure the trigger in the "on" position. It

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:07.650
won't work unless this button is fully pressed,
so let's use plenty of yarn to secure that,

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:12.689
then fasten the drill to the 2x4 with as many
wraps as it takes to hold it tight. The mixing

00:02:12.689 --> 00:02:16.640
beater gets inserted into the drill chuck,
and when it's fastened in tight we can double

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.810
check there's no slack when it rotates.
We'll need the torque setting to be at it's

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:26.590
highest, and confirm the drill is set to reverse.
Now it's time to rig the electrical system.

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:31.720
Let's rip this sheet of aluminum foil in 2
strips, then fold them into makeshift wires.

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:35.610
You can use copper wire if you have it, but
aluminum is still a good conductor, and this

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:40.560
foil will work in a pinch. These ends are
being rolled to a point, and these other ends

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.900
folded over to make them a little thicker.
Now the flat ends can be held in place under

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:48.819
the terminal clips of the drill, and since
we made these wires so long, let's use the

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:53.660
extra length to make sure they're well separated
because they'll short out if they touch. A

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:58.420
little tape will hold those temporarily, until
we can add some yarn to fasten them in place.

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:02.560
The red and black wires are stripped down
about an inch, and for this phone, we don't

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:07.599
need these wires at all. So one cut and they're
gone. Now the red and black wires are attached

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:12.709
to the aluminum leads, respecting the polarity
of the drill. In this case, red is our positive,

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:17.060
and the black is our negative. The wires are
secured with some more yarn, and all we need

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:21.680
now is some leverage for our crank handle.
My wife's salad fork will work, and now that

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:25.629
we've got our handle, I'm thinking this is
ready for a test. I'll start cranking to see

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:30.129
what happens, and look at that, the phone
lit right up. It's showing the little plug

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:35.340
symbol, so we know this is charging, and if
I stop, the symbol goes away. It looks like

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:39.190
it's working great, so I'm gonna take this
inside and clamp it down to a table for better

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:43.870
leverage. The crank handle gets inserted,
and the system is powered up. The charging

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:48.879
symbol is flashing which means I need to crank
just a little bit faster for stable power.

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:53.500
And there it is. I'm cranking this at about
100 RPM to develop the 5 volts this phone

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:59.120
needs to charge. If I crank slower, the phone
won't power up, and if I crank too fast, I

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:03.170
risk damaging it. Just for the challenge,
I'm going to see how long it takes to re-charge

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:07.909
this battery from its completely discharged
condition. It seems to be taking quite a while,

00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:12.140
but when I think about it, it takes quite
a while even when it's plugged in with a charger.

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:16.659
I'm coming up on 3 hours, and I just saw the
charging symbol flash off. That means this

00:04:16.659 --> 00:04:21.970
battery isn't accepting any more charge. It's
done. I can disconnect the charger cable and

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:26.960
this phone is fully ready to go. If this electrical
generator will charge a phone, I'm wondering

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:31.110
if it will recharge a battery. I've added
metal magnets to the ends of a rechargeable

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:35.969
AA battery, so that my alligator clips will
attach easily. By attaching the same wire

00:04:35.969 --> 00:04:40.580
to both ends, we've shorted it out, and the
charge is being drained as quickly as possible,

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:45.860
and I can feel the battery getting hot. This
battery is completely dead now, so to revive

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:49.659
it, I'm adding these lead wires in parallel
with the system, and connecting them to their

00:04:49.659 --> 00:04:54.719
respective terminals. It takes about 15 minutes
of cranking, and it's harder to turn the handle

00:04:54.719 --> 00:05:00.009
this time, because I'm pushing a larger electrical
current into the battery. Alright, it's done,

00:05:00.009 --> 00:05:04.839
and a quick test on the meter shows that the
battery is fully charged. Well that was educational.

00:05:04.839 --> 00:05:09.939
I tried shorting the system out on my meter,
and got about 6 volts at 7 amps. That's over

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:15.000
40 watts of power. I also tried hooking up
an incandescent flashlight bulb, and got it

00:05:15.009 --> 00:05:20.080
to fully illuminate. A white LED was also
tested, and was so bright it actually hurt

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:24.409
my eyes to watch. Well there's a makeshift
electrical generator that you can make in

00:05:24.409 --> 00:05:29.749
a pinch, that will charge batteries, illuminate
lights, and generate around 40 watts on human

00:05:29.749 --> 00:05:32.749
power. And it's free. That's it for now.

00:05:32.749 --> 00:05:36.069
