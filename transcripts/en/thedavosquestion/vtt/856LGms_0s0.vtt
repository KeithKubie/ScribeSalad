00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:04.319
&gt;&gt;James Schiro - Davos Debates 2009 (Environment)

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:10.200
Hi YouTube. I'm Jim Schiro the CEO of Zurich
Financial Services. About three weeks ago

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:16.160
we announced a significant climate change
initiative at Zurich. I know many people are

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:22.430
concerned about, given the current financial
crisis, will a lot of these climate change

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:28.250
initiatives get back to the back burner. I'm
confident that that's not going to happen.

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:32.730
I think that it's extremely important that
climate change become part of the solution

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:40.690
to restore economic growth with the establishment
of innovations and creativity. We've begun

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:47.429
offering products around insuring carbon capture
methods. We've also announced a reduction

00:00:47.429 --> 00:00:53.339
of 10% of our own carbon footprint during
this period in time. I think these are cost

00:00:53.339 --> 00:01:00.179
saving methods that will help us in our business,
but I also think people are too aware at this

00:01:00.179 --> 00:01:06.080
point in time of the danger the climate is
in to take a back burner. So I'm confident

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:11.970
that as long as CEO's keep this on the agenda,
we won't lose out during this current crisis.
