research what they are how to use them
 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.920
research what they are how to use them
and most importantly why to use them so

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930
and most importantly why to use them so
 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.509

what's that got to do with building

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720
what's that got to do with building
 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.170

products it's an excellent question so

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180
products it's an excellent question so
 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.550

research both qualitative and

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560
research both qualitative and
 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.170
research both qualitative and
quantitative is the key to building

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180
quantitative is the key to building
 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.060

great products without measuring the

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070
great products without measuring the
 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:17.840
great products without measuring the
results of our work

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850
results of our work
 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.520

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.450
testing qualitative research and a host
of other methods we really can't

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460
of other methods we really can't
 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.280
of other methods we really can't
understand the impact that our changes

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290
understand the impact that our changes
 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.649
understand the impact that our changes
are having on end-users this means that

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659
are having on end-users this means that
 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.179
are having on end-users this means that
we can do things like make good product

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189
we can do things like make good product
 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:30.560
we can do things like make good product
choices or you know learn from any

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570
choices or you know learn from any
 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.330
choices or you know learn from any
mistakes we might make that make sense

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340
mistakes we might make that make sense
 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.730
mistakes we might make that make sense
so these are just different ways of

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740
so these are just different ways of
 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.640
so these are just different ways of
measuring results so what is qualitative

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650
measuring results so what is qualitative
 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.100
measuring results so what is qualitative
research exactly qualitative research is

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110
research exactly qualitative research is
 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.770
research exactly qualitative research is
about observing and listening to people

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:41.780
about observing and listening to people
 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.539
about observing and listening to people
so it includes things like usability

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549
so it includes things like usability
 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.160
so it includes things like usability

testing customer development interviews
 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.200
testing customer development interviews
and in context studies where you know

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210
and in context studies where you know
 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:49.580
and in context studies where you know
you might observe somebody using a

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590
you might observe somebody using a
 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:50.960
you might observe somebody using a
product in their natural environment

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970
product in their natural environment
 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.149

there are tons of types of qualitative

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159
there are tons of types of qualitative
 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.280
there are tons of types of qualitative
research but you can tell a research is

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290
research but you can tell a research is
 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.249
research but you can tell a research is
qualitative if it involves talking to

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259
qualitative if it involves talking to
 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.920
qualitative if it involves talking to
people or observing real human behavior

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930
people or observing real human behavior
 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.770
people or observing real human behavior
I see that make sense so now these tests

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780
I see that make sense so now these tests
 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:04.959
I see that make sense so now these tests
didn't sound like they're statistically

00:02:04.959 --> 00:02:04.969
didn't sound like they're statistically
 

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:06.980
didn't sound like they're statistically
significant credit that's right they're

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990
significant credit that's right they're
 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.350
significant credit that's right they're
not oh so why do you do them what are

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360
not oh so why do you do them what are
 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.240
not oh so why do you do them what are
they good for so they're great for

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250
they good for so they're great for
 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.800
they good for so they're great for
things

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810
things
 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:13.120

understanding the problem that you're

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130
understanding the problem that you're
 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:14.860
understanding the problem that you're
gonna solve for a user or learning the

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870
gonna solve for a user or learning the
 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:16.449
gonna solve for a user or learning the
context that your product is going to be

00:02:16.449 --> 00:02:16.459
context that your product is going to be
 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:17.949
context that your product is going to be
used in they're also great for building

00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:17.959
used in they're also great for building
 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:20.050
used in they're also great for building
empathy and for really understanding the

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060
empathy and for really understanding the
 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.270
empathy and for really understanding the
person that you're building the product

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280
person that you're building the product
 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.500
person that you're building the product
for that makes sense so what about

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510
for that makes sense so what about
 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:27.550
for that makes sense so what about
quantitative research how is that

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560
quantitative research how is that
 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.410
quantitative research how is that
different than qualitative so

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420
different than qualitative so
 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.180
different than qualitative so
qualitative research is often the

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190
qualitative research is often the
 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:33.160
qualitative research is often the
preferred method of engineers oh it

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170
preferred method of engineers oh it
 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:35.020
preferred method of engineers oh it

testing funnel metrics it's always
 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:39.280
testing funnel metrics it's always
statistically significant and it never

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290
statistically significant and it never
 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.080

do not see quality quantity two really

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:54.860
do not see quality quantity two really
 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:56.500
do not see quality quantity two really
different things about both your user

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510
different things about both your user
 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:59.110
different things about both your user
and your product as a general rule

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120
and your product as a general rule
 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:00.880

quantitative research tells you exactly

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:00.890
quantitative research tells you exactly
 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:02.680
quantitative research tells you exactly
what is happening with your product

what is happening with your product
 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:04.750
what is happening with your product
while qualitative research tells you why

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:04.760
while qualitative research tells you why
 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:07.210
while qualitative research tells you why
it's happening so quant is what got it

qual is why if you use both of these

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.230
qual is why if you use both of these
 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:10.839
qual is why if you use both of these
together you get an enormous amount of

00:03:10.839 --> 00:03:10.849
together you get an enormous amount of
 

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:13.809
together you get an enormous amount of
information about both your product and

00:03:13.809 --> 00:03:13.819
information about both your product and
 

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:15.430

your users and you can come up with some
 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.289
your users and you can come up with some
great ideas about how to make it better

00:03:17.289 --> 00:03:17.299
great ideas about how to make it better
 

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:19.300
great ideas about how to make it better
but I make sense that's really cool so

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:19.310
but I make sense that's really cool so
 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:21.280
but I make sense that's really cool so
can you give me an example how they work

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.290
can you give me an example how they work
 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:21.640
can you give me an example how they work
together

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650
together
 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:24.039
together
yeah so let's imagine that you have a

00:03:24.039 --> 00:03:24.049
yeah so let's imagine that you have a
 

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:25.690
yeah so let's imagine that you have a
product and you're actually charging

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:25.700
product and you're actually charging
 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:28.690
product and you're actually charging
people to use it what I know crazy but I

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:28.700
people to use it what I know crazy but I
 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:30.580
people to use it what I know crazy but I
thought you might like it so at some

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:30.590
thought you might like it so at some
 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:31.960
thought you might like it so at some
point you need to actually put the

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:31.970
point you need to actually put the
 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:33.640
point you need to actually put the
people through a checkout flow of some

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:33.650
people through a checkout flow of some
 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:34.120
people through a checkout flow of some
sort

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:34.130
sort
 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:36.130
sort
ah so you mean getting their payment

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:36.140
ah so you mean getting their payment
 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:37.690
ah so you mean getting their payment
information shipping and billing address

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:37.700
information shipping and billing address
 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:41.080
information shipping and billing address
and so on exactly ah so you can

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:41.090
and so on exactly ah so you can
 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:42.759
and so on exactly ah so you can
visualize your checkout flow as a funnel

00:03:42.759 --> 00:03:42.769
visualize your checkout flow as a funnel
 

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:44.800
visualize your checkout flow as a funnel
let's imagine that this particular flow

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:44.810
let's imagine that this particular flow
 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:47.020
let's imagine that this particular flow
requires all sorts of things that it it

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:47.030
requires all sorts of things that it it
 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:48.280
requires all sorts of things that it it
requires people to create an account

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:48.290
requires people to create an account
 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:50.680

confirm the purchase and then the final

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:54.170
confirm the purchase and then the final
 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:56.140

screen is the thank you screen so you

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:56.150
screen is the thank you screen so you
 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:58.030
screen is the thank you screen so you
want to measure not just how many people

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:58.040
want to measure not just how many people
 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:59.349

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:03.500
drop off at each step of the funnel why
 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:06.039
drop off at each step of the funnel why
is that well it gives you more detailed

00:04:06.039 --> 00:04:06.049
is that well it gives you more detailed
 

00:04:06.049 --> 00:04:07.479
is that well it gives you more detailed
information about where people are

00:04:07.479 --> 00:04:07.489
information about where people are
 

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:10.240
information about where people are
getting stuck see picture that funnel

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:10.250
getting stuck see picture that funnel

100% of the people who want to buy your

00:04:12.009 --> 00:04:12.019
100% of the people who want to buy your
 

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:13.270
100% of the people who want to buy your
product or think they want to buy your

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:13.280
product or think they want to buy your
 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:15.430
product or think they want to buy your
product start at the first step and then

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:15.440
product start at the first step and then
 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:18.310
product start at the first step and then
let's say you lose 20% there then maybe

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:18.320
let's say you lose 20% there then maybe
 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:20.900
let's say you lose 20% there then maybe
you lose 10% at the next step and

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:20.910
you lose 10% at the next step and
 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:23.210
you lose 10% at the next step and
and 50% of the remaining people drop us

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:23.220
and 50% of the remaining people drop us
 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:25.070
and 50% of the remaining people drop us
the next step ouch

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.080
the next step ouch
 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.170
the next step ouch
and then maybe a third on the last step

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.180
and then maybe a third on the last step
 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:28.490
and then maybe a third on the last step
and that means that only a small

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:28.500
and that means that only a small
 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:30.530
and that means that only a small
percentage of the people who started at

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:30.540
percentage of the people who started at
 

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:31.820
percentage of the people who started at
the top are actually getting to the

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:31.830
the top are actually getting to the
 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:32.660
the top are actually getting to the
bottom of the funnel

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:32.670
bottom of the funnel
 

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:34.160

Thanks so if you start with a hundred

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:34.170
Thanks so if you start with a hundred
 

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:36.890
Thanks so if you start with a hundred
people then you've got a 80 and then 72

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:36.900
people then you've got a 80 and then 72
 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:40.160
people then you've got a 80 and then 72
and then 36 and then 24 Wow

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:40.170
and then 36 and then 24 Wow
 

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:42.140
and then 36 and then 24 Wow
and suddenly only 24 people are actually

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:42.150
and suddenly only 24 people are actually
 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:44.030
and suddenly only 24 people are actually
making it through to the end and paying

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:44.040
making it through to the end and paying
 

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:46.070
making it through to the end and paying
you for your product but the nice thing

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:46.080
you for your product but the nice thing
 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:47.570
you for your product but the nice thing
about knowing how many people you lose

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:47.580
about knowing how many people you lose
 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:49.340
about knowing how many people you lose
in each step is that you could use that

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:49.350
in each step is that you could use that
 

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:51.770
in each step is that you could use that
information to decide which step to make

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:51.780
information to decide which step to make
 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:54.470
information to decide which step to make
changes to in order to best increase the

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:54.480
changes to in order to best increase the
 

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:55.550
changes to in order to best increase the
number of people who make it all the way

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:55.560
number of people who make it all the way
 

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:56.090
number of people who make it all the way
to the end

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:56.100
to the end
 

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:58.430
to the end
oh I see so you might want to make some

00:04:58.430 --> 00:04:58.440
oh I see so you might want to make some
 

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:00.110
oh I see so you might want to make some
changes in this case to step three where

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:00.120
changes in this case to step three where
 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:02.360
changes in this case to step three where
you're losing 50% of the people that's

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:02.370
you're losing 50% of the people that's
 

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:03.800
you're losing 50% of the people that's
right that's clearly a friction point

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:03.810
right that's clearly a friction point
 

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:06.500
right that's clearly a friction point
but of course at this point we just know

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:06.510
but of course at this point we just know
 

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:08.930
but of course at this point we just know
that people are dropping off there we

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:08.940
that people are dropping off there we
 

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:11.210
that people are dropping off there we
don't know why yet can we just guess hmm

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:11.220
don't know why yet can we just guess hmm
 

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:14.810
don't know why yet can we just guess hmm
well we could but our guess this would

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:14.820
well we could but our guess this would
 

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:15.920
well we could but our guess this would
be a lot better if we did some

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:15.930
be a lot better if we did some
 

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:17.360
be a lot better if we did some
observational user research to

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:17.370
observational user research to
 

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:19.910
observational user research to
understand whether there's a specific

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:19.920
understand whether there's a specific
 

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:21.140
understand whether there's a specific
problem that people are having on that

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:21.150
problem that people are having on that
 

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:23.000
problem that people are having on that
step so for example maybe there's

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:23.010
step so for example maybe there's
 

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:25.220
step so for example maybe there's
something really confusing or maybe

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:25.230
something really confusing or maybe
 

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:26.300
something really confusing or maybe
there's some information that people

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:26.310
there's some information that people
 

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:27.800
there's some information that people
don't have available to them on that

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:27.810
don't have available to them on that
 

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:30.440
don't have available to them on that
step right or maybe the page just loads

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:30.450
step right or maybe the page just loads
 

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:32.420
step right or maybe the page just loads
really slowly for some people by

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:32.430
really slowly for some people by
 

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:34.250
really slowly for some people by
observing five or six people going

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:34.260
observing five or six people going
 

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.500
observing five or six people going
through that whole checkout flow you can

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:36.510
through that whole checkout flow you can
 

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:38.210
through that whole checkout flow you can
start to make some much better guesses

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:38.220
start to make some much better guesses
 

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:39.560
start to make some much better guesses
about what you'd want to fix on that

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:39.570
about what you'd want to fix on that
 

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:42.710
about what you'd want to fix on that
step three that makes sense so now let's

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:42.720
step three that makes sense so now let's
 

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:44.240
step three that makes sense so now let's
say we know what the problem is what do

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:44.250
say we know what the problem is what do
 

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:46.310
say we know what the problem is what do
we do then well then you fix it of

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:46.320
we do then well then you fix it of
 

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:48.350
we do then well then you fix it of
course if it involves big changes to

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:48.360
course if it involves big changes to
 

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:49.909
course if it involves big changes to
that step work to the rest of the flow

00:05:49.909 --> 00:05:49.919
that step work to the rest of the flow
 

00:05:49.919 --> 00:05:51.530
that step work to the rest of the flow
you might want to do some qualitative

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:51.540
you might want to do some qualitative
 

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:52.970
you might want to do some qualitative
usability research while you're

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:52.980
usability research while you're
 

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:54.620
usability research while you're
designing it common that can help make

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:54.630
designing it common that can help make
 

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:55.700
designing it common that can help make
sure that your next version of the

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:55.710
sure that your next version of the
 

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:57.409
sure that your next version of the
checkout flow doesn't introduce new

00:05:57.409 --> 00:05:57.419
checkout flow doesn't introduce new
 

00:05:57.419 --> 00:05:59.780
checkout flow doesn't introduce new
usability problems so when you're pretty

00:05:59.780 --> 00:05:59.790
usability problems so when you're pretty
 

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:00.980
usability problems so when you're pretty
sure you've got a good change to the

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:00.990
sure you've got a good change to the
 

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:02.960
sure you've got a good change to the
product you build it in you ship it that

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:02.970
product you build it in you ship it that
 

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:04.790
product you build it in you ship it that
makes sense but that's not the end of

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:04.800
makes sense but that's not the end of
 

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:06.560
makes sense but that's not the end of
course you still need to release the fix

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:06.570
course you still need to release the fix
 

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:08.270
course you still need to release the fix
in an a/b test oh yeah

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:08.280
in an a/b test oh yeah
 

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:10.640
in an a/b test oh yeah
so a be testing is another form of

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:10.650
so a be testing is another form of
 

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:13.400
so a be testing is another form of
quantitative research this means that we

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:13.410
quantitative research this means that we
 

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:15.080
quantitative research this means that we
can validate that we've really fixed the

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:15.090
can validate that we've really fixed the
 

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:16.760
can validate that we've really fixed the
problem that we had and we have an

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:16.770
problem that we had and we have an
 

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:18.300
problem that we had and we have an
introduced nuance

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:18.310
introduced nuance
 

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:21.330
introduced nuance
I see so this way we've identified what

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:21.340
I see so this way we've identified what
 

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:23.520
I see so this way we've identified what
the problem is with quantitative

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:23.530
the problem is with quantitative
 

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:25.590
the problem is with quantitative
research and then we've got an idea of

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:25.600
research and then we've got an idea of
 

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:27.090
research and then we've got an idea of
why the problems happening with

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:27.100
why the problems happening with
 

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:30.090
why the problems happening with
qualitative but then we actually then

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:30.100
qualitative but then we actually then
 

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:32.130
qualitative but then we actually then
use qualitative research to help design

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:32.140
use qualitative research to help design
 

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:34.020
use qualitative research to help design
the change and then confirm that we

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:34.030
the change and then confirm that we
 

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:36.840
the change and then confirm that we
fixed it with quantitative again exactly

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:36.850
fixed it with quantitative again exactly
 

00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:40.530
fixed it with quantitative again exactly
wow that's cool that makes sense so I'm

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:40.540
wow that's cool that makes sense so I'm
 

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:41.940
wow that's cool that makes sense so I'm
gonna play a devil's advocate now so

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:41.950
gonna play a devil's advocate now so
 

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:44.070
gonna play a devil's advocate now so
I've heard that it's not worth it to do

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:44.080
I've heard that it's not worth it to do
 

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:45.690
I've heard that it's not worth it to do
qualitative research because users

00:06:45.690 --> 00:06:45.700
qualitative research because users
 

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:46.980
qualitative research because users
really don't know what they want so

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:46.990
really don't know what they want so
 

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:49.920
really don't know what they want so
asking them is useless is that true well

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:49.930
asking them is useless is that true well
 

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:52.020
asking them is useless is that true well
I've heard that too and it's a

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:52.030
I've heard that too and it's a
 

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:53.400
I've heard that too and it's a
fundamental misunderstanding of how to

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:53.410
fundamental misunderstanding of how to
 

00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:55.980
fundamental misunderstanding of how to
do good qualitative user research ah so

00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:55.990
do good qualitative user research ah so
 

00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:58.020
do good qualitative user research ah so
let's let's be totally clear if you're

00:06:58.020 --> 00:06:58.030
let's let's be totally clear if you're
 

00:06:58.030 --> 00:06:59.760
let's let's be totally clear if you're
just asking people what you should build

00:06:59.760 --> 00:06:59.770
just asking people what you should build
 

00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:02.100
just asking people what you should build
and then going in building it you're

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:02.110
and then going in building it you're
 

00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:03.240
and then going in building it you're
probably not gonna make a very good

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:03.250
probably not gonna make a very good

you're not actually doing good
qualitative research you're just

00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:10.390
qualitative research you're just

00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:30.160
asking that question so what do you
 

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:33.000
asking that question so what do you
think this product should do that makes

so now what about the argument that you

00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:35.350
so now what about the argument that you
 

00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:37.770
