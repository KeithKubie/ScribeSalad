Doug Walker: What can I say about the most despised movie prequel in cinema history?

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.580
Well, I can say this: who has two thumbs and totally saw it coming?

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.620
This guy. That's right. I've been waiting years for these bragging rights, and now it's finally come.

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:33.440
I knew from the first trailer that this was gonna be a bad movie. It just kinda came down to logical deduction.

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:39.220
Lucas only directed one Star Wars film. And as impressive as it was, it had a lot of problems.

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.300
The writing was hokey, the acting was stilted, and there's a lot of things that didn't always make sense.

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.420
But he had a lot of people to give him advice and limitation, so it still turned out a good product.

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:54.840
Then, years later, after barely directing a thing, this guy is suddenly supposed to direct a masterpiece?

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.280
Though, in all fairness, even I couldn't guess it'd be this bad.

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:10.320
It starts off as Obi-Wan and his master are trying to figure out...some sort of political taxation, Federation stuff that...yeah, like you, I can't figure out it, either.

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:19.420
They try to help the newly elected child queen Amidala, which...you don't elect queens, and queens can't be children, but, whatevs...

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:24.600
and along the way, they come across the death of comedy, Jar Jar Binks, and the death of acting, Anakin Skywalker.

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.200
Anakin, it turns out, is a virgin birth...yeah, it can't get any more obvious than that...

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:33.320
and, according to a blood test, apparently the Force is very strong with him.

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:37.120
Oh, the amount of people this pissed off...oh, we'll get to that later.

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:44.620
They buy Anakin from one stereotype to deliver him to two other stereotypes, who are in cahoots with the senator named Palpatine, who is secretly the Emperor,

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:50.280
who wants to get the Queen to sign the treaty because...political stuff.

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:56.840
We get sword fights, gunfights, space battles, and through all of it, I have no idea what they're fighting for.

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:05.400
But, who cares, right? In the original, it was just an evil Empire. We didn't really know their politics, they were just kind of evil, so maybe we can just do the same thing here, right?

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:11.180
Well, that would work if the characters were the least bit interesting, and by God, are they not.

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.000
My complaints are your complaints.

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:23.640
The acting is so wooden, the writing's so fifth grade, the effects way too computer-generated, the comedy way too kindergarten, the stereotypes way too offensive.

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.460
Yeah, what else can I say about this that every other person on the planet hasn't said?

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:34.440
Well, I guess I'll try to defend it a touch, as everybody acts like this is the worst thing ever made, and it's not.

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:38.620
It's just a bad movie coming off the heels of some of the most popular films ever made.

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:46.360
As tiring as the constant CG gets in this, there are a lot of very neat landscapes. The worlds are very creative and very beautiful to look at.

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:52.300
The sword fights got a lot better, too. Remember when Darth Vader and Obi-Wan were just kind of tapping those lightsticks together?

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:57.600
Well, now, this is a straight-on battle, and it looks amazing. It's still impressive even years later.

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:09.760
And whether you see it as a good thing or a bad thing, there is something interesting watching a guy's dream suddenly come to life with nobody getting in the way. It's a fully-realized vision with no filters whatsoever.

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:16.280
And as someone who loves film and artists, it's interesting to see. It...just so happens it's not very good.

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:18.140
But it's still interesting.

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:20.920
Was this always planned from the beginning? Probably not.

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:27.960
But it's also kind of neat to see the changes he'd want to make and, yeah, what happens when a filmmaker stays away from his craft so long.

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:32.020
I can even make a small argument for the midi-chlorians.

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:38.920
It's been proven that a lot of people that seem to have a spiritual essence or a lot of energy, the water in their blood is affected.

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:52.940
So, in a very slim way, you could kind of make the argument that this is credible and doesn't get in the way of the philosophical and religious aspects, but even I admit, it's very, very slim.

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:58.680
I'm just trying to offer an interesting point of view, but, yeah, like everyone, I thought this was a turd also.

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:07.680
The story's too complicated for kids to follow, and the dialogue is too childish for adults to follow. So unlike the original three, where it spoke to both, this one speaks to neither.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:20.960
I'm hearing more and more that there are a lot of kids that grew up with this because, hey, they like Jar Jar, they like poop jokes, and they like a lot of the visuals, which is interesting when you watch them grow up and realize that the original three films were much better than this.

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:25.060
Honestly, the most entertaining thing about this film is the fan reaction.

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:32.000
The fact that people waited days in line, and then were in such denial when they found out it was bad. They didn't even admit it was bad.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:42.500
They tried to bargain with themselves and be convinced that it was actually good, but overtime, nobody could defend the poop jokes. Nobody could defend the racial stereotypes.

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:50.080
As much as critics at the time actually tried to say this was a good movie...yeah, look up the reviews at the time, they tried to defend it...

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:57.500
it showed in full view the power of hype, and how long it took for so many people to admit the Emperor has no clothes.

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:10.080
Honestly, in many respects, it's kind of an important movie for that. It shows that artists are flawed and there is no perfect project. Hell, even the original Star Wars had a lot of stilted acting and hokey dialogue.

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:18.040
For a lot of fans, this was the bursting of the bubble, the ending of the fairy tale, the "having to face real life". But there's advantages to that, too.

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:21.580
It tells people that, hey, you don't have to be perfect to make good stuff.

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:30.460
You can learn, you can change things, you can make stuff better. Even your heroes aren't always your heroes. And that's okay. You can be inspired to do better work.

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:39.360
If you're one of those people that claim Lucas killed your childhood, you never had a childhood to begin with, or you're constantly trying to stay in it and reject your grown up world.

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:45.080
Bottom line, he got his vision made, and it sucked, but at least he got it made exactly how he wanted it.

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:57.920
It still did well at the box office, so you can't claim it's a waste of money. But, yeah, after years of spin-off books and spin-off games and so much that was being done with the Star Wars universe that Lucas had little involvement with, did I expect a lot more?

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:06.720
Oh, yeah. But it's still such an interesting turnout in how strange and awful it is that it's kind of something to analyze.

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:16.320
We'll never know. Was it just too many yes-men, or was he away from filming too long, or was he never really that talented to begin with, it was just other people that made it work?

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:20.560
It's one of the great mysteries that's fun to speculate. And if you like it, great.

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:32.300
I wish I could have such an innocent mind not to see all these offensive stereotypes. I'm sure he thought he was doing some clever commentary, but if you don't see how this movie can piss off a lot of people, enjoy it.

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:35.560
You're definitely part of a rare minority, and don't let anyone take that away from you.

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:44.240
But for me, and a lot of other people, it's as if the voices of millions of people cried out in terror and were suddenly never given their money back.
