00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:02.660
So I have this yellow
rectangle here,

00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:04.830
and we know two things
about this yellow rectangle.

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:07.450
We know that it
has a length of 10,

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:10.650
that the length of this
side right over here is 10.

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.370
And we also know that
this yellow rectangle

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:16.690
has an area of 60
square units, whatever

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:19.580
units we're
measuring this 10 in.

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:23.480
So what I want you to do
is now pause this video,

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:25.240
and based on the
information given

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:27.370
on these other rectangles--
so in some of them

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:29.860
we give you two of their
dimensions, in some of them

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:32.009
we give you something
like the perimeter

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.970
and one of the dimensions--
I want you to pause the video

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:38.090
and think about which of these
rectangles, if any of them,

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:42.390
have either the same area
or the same perimeter

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.630
as this yellow rectangle.

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:47.630
So pause the video right now.

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:50.030
Well, the best way to
figure out which of these

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:53.560
have the same area or perimeter
as this original yellow

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:56.130
rectangle is to just figure
out the area and the perimeter

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:58.720
for all of these rectangles
and see which ones of them

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:00.230
are equivalent.

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:01.990
So we already know
the area for this one,

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:03.830
but we don't know its perimeter.

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:05.245
So how do we figure that out?

00:01:05.245 --> 00:01:06.620
Well, to figure
out perimeter, we

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:09.350
would need to know the
lengths of all the sides.

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:14.030
Well, if the area is 60 square
units, that means the length

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:20.850
times the width is equal to
60, that 10 times this width

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.080
right over here is
going to be equal to 60.

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:26.540
So 10 times what is equal to 60?

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:29.840
Well, 10 times 6 is equal to 60.

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.530
10 times 6 is equal
to 60 square units.

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:36.720
10 units times 6 units is
equal to 60 square units.

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:37.220
Fair enough.

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:39.870
So how do we figure
out the perimeter now?

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:41.170
Well, this is a rectangle.

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:42.790
So we know if this
length is 10, then

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:44.680
this length must also be 10.

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:48.274
And if this width is 6, then
this width must be 6 as well.

00:01:48.274 --> 00:01:49.940
And now we can figure
out the perimeter.

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:53.717
It's 10 plus 10 plus
6 plus 6, which is 32.

00:01:53.717 --> 00:01:54.800
So let me write that down.

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:59.090
The perimeter of our
original yellow rectangle

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.980
is equal to 32.

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:04.180
Now let's go on to each
of these other rectangles

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.530
and figure out what their
perimeters and the areas are.

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:09.720
We already know the perimeter
for this purple or mauve

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.110
rectangle, but we need
to figure out its area.

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:14.430
In order to figure out
its area, we can't just

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.790
rely on this one dimension
just on its width.

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:19.390
We have to figure out
its length as well.

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:21.510
So how do we figure that out?

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.980
Well, one way to realize
it is that the perimeter

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.370
is the distance all the
way around the rectangle.

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:30.430
So what would be the distance
halfway around the rectangle?

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:31.760
So let me see if I can draw it.

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.970
What would be the distance
of this side, our length,

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.440
plus this side?

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.520
Well, it would be
half the perimeter.

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:44.090
5 plus something is going to
be equal to half the perimeter.

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:45.890
Remember, the perimeter
is all four sides.

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:47.530
If we just took these
two sides, which

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:49.340
would be half the perimeter.

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:51.420
So, these two sides
must be equal to,

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:54.240
when you take their sum,
must be equal to 17,

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:55.180
half the perimeter.

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:58.960
So 5 plus what is equal to 17?

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:01.970
5 plus this question
mark is equal to 17.

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:05.100
Well, 5 plus 12 is equal to 17.

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:06.150
And you can verify this.

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:09.810
12 plus 5 is 17, and
then that times 2

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:12.450
gets us the perimeter of 34.

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:15.530
Now, given that, what is
the area of this figure?

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:18.240
Well, the area's going to
be 12 units times 5 units

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:21.180
to get 60 square units.

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:24.070
Area is equal to 60.

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:26.280
So this one right over
here has the same area,

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:27.600
different perimeter.

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:32.530
Same area as the original yellow
rectangle, different area.

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:33.770
Now let's go over here.

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:35.710
So this is not just a rectangle.

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:37.290
This is also a
square, because I have

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:40.040
the same length
and the same width.

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:41.929
So what's the area here?

00:03:41.929 --> 00:03:43.720
Well, for the area, I
just have to multiply

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:44.844
the length times the width.

00:03:44.844 --> 00:03:48.970
8 units times 8 units
is 64 square units.

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:50.390
And what is the perimeter here?

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:56.930
Well, these two sides are going
to make up half the perimeter.

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:58.596
If I wanted to figure
out the whole one,

00:03:58.596 --> 00:04:00.790
I know this is also
8 and this is also 8.

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:03.300
So the perimeter is 8 times 4.

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:07.660
8 times 4 sides,
which is equal to 32.

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:10.240
So this square right over
here has a different area,

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:15.704
but it has the same perimeter
as our original yellow square.

00:04:15.704 --> 00:04:17.120
Now let's move
onto this blue one.

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:18.279
What's the area?

00:04:18.279 --> 00:04:20.000
And you're probably
getting used to this.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.400
15 units times 4 units is
going to be 60 square units.

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:27.260
And what's the perimeter?

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.010
What's the perimeter?

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:30.590
Well, it's going
to be 4 plus 15,

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:32.160
and whatever that is times 2.

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:34.800
4 plus 15 is 19.

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:39.210
And then 19 times 2 is 38.

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:42.470
So this one right here
has the same area,

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:45.570
different perimeter
as our original.

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:49.440
Now, finally, here in
purple, what is the area?

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:54.920
The area is 10 times 20,
which is equal to 200.

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:57.590
So if it's 10, say, well,
10 units times 20 units

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:00.250
is 200 square units.

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:02.890
And what is the perimeter?

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:04.860
What is the perimeter?

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:08.550
Well, 10 plus 20 is 30, but
I've just considered only two

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:10.330
of the sides right here.

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:11.910
That's only half way around.

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:15.940
So 10 plus 20 is
30 times 2 is 60.

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:16.950
So let's see.

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:19.457
This has a different
area, and it also

00:05:19.457 --> 00:05:20.540
has a different perimeter.

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:23.760
This one's perimeter looks
just like the same number.

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:25.469
It's 60, as is the
area here, but that's

00:05:25.469 --> 00:05:26.510
not what we're comparing.

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:28.670
We have a different
perimeter and different area.

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:33.194
So neither of these are the
same as our original rectangle.
