[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.500
LUCAS CONLEY: Mark and I
started researching Legacy back

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:12.050
in 2012.

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:14.570
And part of the reason
we did is that we

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:16.145
saw a lot of brands
and headlines,

00:00:16.145 --> 00:00:20.210
like you do see today, that
were going out of business.

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:23.000
Brands that had been
around for a long time.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.280
Just this past few
months, we've seen

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:28.670
Toys "R" Us, Gibson guitars.

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:31.430
Today, Orchard Supply Hardware.

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:33.770
Blockbuster actually had a
couple of stores in Alaska

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:37.280
still open that nobody knew
about that just closed.

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.650
And the question arose, what is
it about the current context,

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:44.900
the current market that
these longstanding brands

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:48.900
that we thought would always
be around are no longer here?

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:51.427
And we looked closer
at culture and saw

00:00:51.427 --> 00:00:53.510
that we live in a very
short-term world right now.

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:55.550
People are looking for
instant gratification.

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.070
They're looking for
overnight success.

00:00:58.070 --> 00:00:59.780
We celebrate it in the media.

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:04.010
And when we looked at the
brands that were actually

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:06.900
building modern legacies,
we saw different behaviors.

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.180
So that was actually the
inspiration for this book.

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:12.410
We'll be going back and
forth tonight or today

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:15.230
talking a bit about the
stories in the book.

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:19.280
And we'll leave some time
at the end for questions

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:20.900
about the material as well.

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:22.730
But I'll turn it
over to Mark just

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:24.770
to share some of the
original inspiration

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:27.510
for the Legacy Lab, which
is where this all started.

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:28.700
MARK MILLER: Hi, I'm Mark.

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.040
I'm very Canadian.

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:35.090
My parents sent me here
from Toronto and said,

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:37.280
you're a failed musician.

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:38.877
You seem to be failing
in advertising.

00:01:38.877 --> 00:01:41.460
Maybe you could write a book and
make the family proud of you.

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.610
So the inspiration
for this is my parents

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:46.910
kicked my ass to write a book.

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:49.760
In addition, I happened to
be working on some business

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:52.280
problems for two very
iconic brands, the Lexus

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:53.840
and the Ritz-Carlton.

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.240
And one was coming up
on being 25 years old,

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.910
and one was coming up
on being 30 years old.

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:01.310
And they had a fundamentally
different point of view

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.460
on how they looked at
their age, their success,

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:07.540
where they'd been, where they
were, where they were going.

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:09.350
In the case of the
automotive company,

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:12.890
they felt that 25 years
was too young to celebrate

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:13.950
all their success.

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.908
They felt that if they
said, look how far we've

00:02:15.908 --> 00:02:18.890
come in only 25 years, the
brands like BMW and Mercedes

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:20.590
would say when you
get to be 80, 90,

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:22.440
or 100 years old,
that's the moment when

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:23.660
you should celebrate.

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.610
But if you really want
to remark upon 25 years,

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:29.570
we'll just pat you on
the back and say, look

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:31.340
how far you still have to go.

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:33.230
And the iconic hotel
company saw things

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:34.880
in exactly the
opposite way, which

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:38.810
was at the age of 30 they felt
that a 30-year-old Ritz-Carlton

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:40.160
was too old to celebrate.

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.830
That it was far better
to be The Cosmopolitan,

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:45.660
which was brand new, than
the 30-year-old Ritz-Carlton.

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.170
And I found that
fascinating because so

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:51.380
many startup companies
and entrepreneurs would

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:53.960
come into our organization
and say, how do you

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:55.640
succeed like Lexus
and Ritz-Carlton

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:57.560
in 25 and 30 years,
and yet these brands

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.800
did not know how to make
sense of their own success?

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:03.950
Concurrently, I work at
an agency called Team One.

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:05.540
We work on Lexis
and Ritz-Carlton.

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:08.000
And we were going through our
own sort of identity crisis,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:14.270
which is we started in
1987, and effectively still

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:17.210
a modern agency, but the world
was transforming all around us.

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:20.180
As you know, social
media companies

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:21.560
were behaving like ad agencies.

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.720
And entertainment companies
were behaving like ad agencies.

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:25.920
And ad agencies were behaving
like media companies.

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.490
And what we used to take
for granted as being certain

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:30.950
was changing dramatically.

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:33.140
And then probably
most importantly, I

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:35.609
was about to become a
dad for the first time

00:03:35.609 --> 00:03:38.150
in my life, which was incredibly
scary because I could barely

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:39.200
take care of myself.

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:42.090
So now I'd be having to
take care of another life,

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:45.200
and I was concerned that
the example I wanted

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.230
to set for my daughter wasn't
just that I worked very hard,

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:50.536
but to no end in
specific, but that I

00:03:50.536 --> 00:03:52.160
worked very hard
toward an end that was

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:54.080
meaningful and important to me.

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:56.090
And for that reason,
I started looking

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:58.730
at leaders of organizations
that were building careers

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:01.880
and building brands that had
stories that I had admired,

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:03.430
many of which we
cover in the book,

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:05.450
but they weren't the ones
who were simply doing things

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:06.991
to make the greatest
amount of money,

00:04:06.991 --> 00:04:09.020
but the ones doing things
to make the greatest

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:10.110
amount of contribution.

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:12.080
So those were the
ingredients that

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:15.149
really inspired me to start
researching this topic.

00:04:15.149 --> 00:04:17.149
And then I reached out
to friends and colleagues

00:04:17.149 --> 00:04:20.089
and peers, including
Lucas, who had

00:04:20.089 --> 00:04:22.160
a wonderful career as a
writer and a researcher

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:24.410
with Fast Company,
and I was hoping

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:26.180
he'd share a little bit about--

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:28.460
other than I bothered
him to do it--

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:29.989
why he bothered to help.

00:04:29.989 --> 00:04:30.780
LUCAS CONLEY: Yeah.

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:33.980
So Mark I've been collaborating
for over a decade.

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:39.200
And I started my career back in
2002 at the "Atlantic Monthly,"

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:42.610
and that's a magazine that
really invests in long stories.

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:45.110
While I was there, they actually
published the longest story

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:46.693
that they've ever
published, which was

00:04:46.693 --> 00:04:48.305
three cover issues in a row.

00:04:48.305 --> 00:04:50.150
They won a national
magazine award that year

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:55.370
on the unbuilding of the World
Trade Center, back in 2001.

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:58.850
So I came out of that space in
journalism of really investing

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:03.290
in stories, really telling what
was behind what the mainstream

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:05.765
media or the standard
media would tell

00:05:05.765 --> 00:05:08.670
in a journalistic
approach to a story,

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:12.520
to going on to Fast Company--
where Fast Company was

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:14.390
a publication that
was all about telling

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:16.610
personal stories in a business
world-- really getting

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:19.622
into the leaders
behind the brands.

00:05:19.622 --> 00:05:21.080
Whereas "Fortune"
or "Forbes" might

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:23.680
talk about the numbers
or the products more,

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:26.210
Fast Company was really
interested in the culture

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:28.500
and the people that
built those brands.

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:31.820
So when Mark started describing
a project about Legacy,

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:32.690
my ears perked up.

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:36.110
I knew that was something that
really resonated with readers.

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:38.989
And when I actually got
on the ground working

00:05:38.989 --> 00:05:41.030
with some of the interviews,
I was hearing things

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:44.000
that I rarely ever
heard in journalism.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.220
People would describe for
us a variety of stories

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:47.730
throughout their life, and
at the end of the interview

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:49.550
say, hey, can I get
a transcript of this?

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:52.070
I've never talked about
a lot of this stuff.

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:54.500
And these were CEOs who'd been
interviewed countless times

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:55.290
throughout their career.

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:57.165
So I knew that we were
asking about something

00:05:57.165 --> 00:05:58.680
that was very important.

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:01.310
Whether you ask somebody
young or old about Legacy,

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:04.550
they have some very personal,
meaningful things to share

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:05.990
about the way they
see their life,

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:08.840
the way they see meaning
and significance.

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:15.010
So it was a very rich topic
to invest our time in.

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:19.070
And well, what is
interesting from there

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:21.020
is that it wasn't just
our personal interest.

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:23.090
I mean, we started
to see that there

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:27.560
were leaders who also
wanted to share that,

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:29.251
the story of their legacy.

00:06:29.251 --> 00:06:31.250
MARK MILLER: So what we
thought we would do over

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:34.490
the course of the next
15, 20-ish minutes

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:37.130
is walk through some of the
key principles that we've

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:39.720
learned from the leaders
that we spoke to.

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:41.697
We'll top line the five
key chapters, the five

00:06:41.697 --> 00:06:44.030
key principles, and tell you
some iconic stories that we

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:45.140
love to share.

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:47.090
Certainly at the end,
if you have questions,

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:48.260
we'd be happy to take them.

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:49.820
If they're easy questions,
we'd be even happier.

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:51.690
If they're hard, we'll
probably say, oh,

00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:54.023
that's a really good question
and we'll get back to you,

00:06:54.023 --> 00:06:55.760
and we may or may not.

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:59.000
So the first chapter in the
book is about taking leadership

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:00.020
personally.

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:04.200
And as a bit of an anecdote,
I went to business school.

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:06.680
And the reason that matters
is because I remember

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:09.930
talking to my parents distinctly
at one point and said,

00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:13.560
I'm thinking that
for higher education

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:16.142
I may go to film school, or I
may go to a business school.

00:07:16.142 --> 00:07:18.350
And they said, well, you
should do whatever you want,

00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:20.250
as long as you go to
a business school.

00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:22.045
So I did that, and one
of the first lessons

00:07:22.045 --> 00:07:23.420
they taught at
business school is

00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:25.730
what is the responsibility
of a business today?

00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:29.032
To which the answer was,
maximize shareholder revenue.

00:07:29.032 --> 00:07:31.240
They never talked about
taking leadership personally.

00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:33.250
In fact, they said
leadership is organizational,

00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:34.239
it's not personal.

00:07:34.239 --> 00:07:35.780
And the other
responsibility you have

00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:39.930
is to maximize shareholder
return revenue.

00:07:39.930 --> 00:07:41.780
And yet, the leaders
that we spoke

00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:44.960
to speak beautifully and
prolifically about the things

00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:45.740
that drive them.

00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:48.920
And seldom, if ever, did they
begin conversations with,

00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:51.350
I had an idea that I wanted
to make a billion dollars

00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:52.511
and sell my company.

00:07:52.511 --> 00:07:54.260
They always began with
a problem that they

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:56.510
were trying to solve or
a quality or an attribute

00:07:56.510 --> 00:07:58.490
that they wanted to
put into the world.

00:07:58.490 --> 00:08:00.729
And the Tribeca Film
Festival was a story

00:08:00.729 --> 00:08:02.270
that I happened to
fall in love with.

00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:04.853
As I said, I grew up in Toronto,
and the Toronto Film Festival

00:08:04.853 --> 00:08:06.090
was a major event.

00:08:06.090 --> 00:08:09.410
And I was always curious to know
in a cluttered, cloudy field

00:08:09.410 --> 00:08:12.170
of Sundance, and
Cannes, and Toronto,

00:08:12.170 --> 00:08:15.620
how does a modern festival like
Tribeca pop up and succeed?

00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:17.960
To which the answer from
the founders of Tribeca,

00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:20.700
De Niro, and Rosenthal,
and Hatkoff was the world

00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:23.245
didn't actually need
another film festival.

00:08:23.245 --> 00:08:25.370
And so if all we were
creating was a film festival,

00:08:25.370 --> 00:08:26.487
this would have failed.

00:08:26.487 --> 00:08:28.820
And whereas the world didn't
need another film festival,

00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:31.040
the world didn't need the
Tribeca Film Festival.

00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:33.679
And I'll share with you the
story they shared with me.

00:08:33.679 --> 00:08:35.720
The three of them grew up
in and around New York.

00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:37.309
They happened to love film.

00:08:37.309 --> 00:08:39.409
They were people
of means and people

00:08:39.409 --> 00:08:42.201
with tremendous influence,
who at one point

00:08:42.201 --> 00:08:43.909
toyed with the idea
of introducing a film

00:08:43.909 --> 00:08:45.920
festival into New
York because that

00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:47.851
was their lifelong
passion, but they never

00:08:47.851 --> 00:08:49.850
really saw a hole in the
conventional landscape.

00:08:49.850 --> 00:08:51.900
It just didn't make sense.

00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:53.630
And then 9/11 happened.

00:08:53.630 --> 00:08:56.570
And here you have some people
that weren't just filmmakers,

00:08:56.570 --> 00:08:59.270
but had a deep care
and consideration

00:08:59.270 --> 00:09:01.075
for the city that was home.

00:09:01.075 --> 00:09:02.450
And they observed
from where they

00:09:02.450 --> 00:09:04.900
sat, as people with
means and influence,

00:09:04.900 --> 00:09:07.250
that if people weren't
going out and patronizing

00:09:07.250 --> 00:09:10.400
the businesses that were still
around, that not only would New

00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:14.370
York feel devoid of
life and vitality,

00:09:14.370 --> 00:09:17.840
but as commerce would dwindle,
the city would get worse, not

00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:19.020
better, over time.

00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:21.150
And so they went
out to restaurants.

00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:22.760
And they thought,
what if we can get

00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:25.100
more of our friends, who also
have influence and means,

00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:26.090
to come with us?

00:09:26.090 --> 00:09:28.700
And they created a program
called Dinner Downtown.

00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:32.600
This existed before the Tribeca
Film Festival was ever born.

00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:35.314
And all they did was they
said, you, my friend, you

00:09:35.314 --> 00:09:36.230
should come to dinner.

00:09:36.230 --> 00:09:38.120
And you should invite
10 of your friends,

00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:40.290
and let's keep doing
the same thing.

00:09:40.290 --> 00:09:42.230
And so they grew
an event which they

00:09:42.230 --> 00:09:44.570
ran on more than one occasion,
where hundreds of people,

00:09:44.570 --> 00:09:46.100
very influential
people, including

00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:49.664
Bill Clinton and Queen Noor,
would come and patronize

00:09:49.664 --> 00:09:50.330
the restaurants.

00:09:50.330 --> 00:09:52.070
And what they
observed was if this

00:09:52.070 --> 00:09:54.770
is what we can do with
small application,

00:09:54.770 --> 00:09:56.930
could we somehow
scale that to impact

00:09:56.930 --> 00:09:58.340
more of the City of New York?

00:09:58.340 --> 00:10:00.290
They actually-- their
language was they

00:10:00.290 --> 00:10:02.150
thought about contribution
before they ever

00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:03.394
thought about extraction.

00:10:03.394 --> 00:10:05.060
And the contribution
they wanted to make

00:10:05.060 --> 00:10:08.240
was more people in New York,
coming out, patronizing,

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:11.540
consuming, adding
vitality and culture.

00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:13.340
And they simply
used film, the thing

00:10:13.340 --> 00:10:17.210
they knew really well, as a
galvanizing mechanism to do it.

00:10:17.210 --> 00:10:18.560
They made a lofty promise.

00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:20.450
It was close to
the end of the year

00:10:20.450 --> 00:10:23.720
and they basically said
four months into 2002,

00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:26.374
the Tribeca Film
Festival would be born.

00:10:26.374 --> 00:10:27.540
They lead with their hearts.

00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:28.820
They lead with their passion.

00:10:28.820 --> 00:10:30.920
They lead with their ambition.

00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:33.110
But they weren't
fully mature thinkers.

00:10:33.110 --> 00:10:35.450
They didn't actually think
it all the way through,

00:10:35.450 --> 00:10:37.976
in terms of how do we
get money for this thing?

00:10:37.976 --> 00:10:39.350
How do we communicate
this thing?

00:10:39.350 --> 00:10:41.725
How do we make sure that not
only our hundreds of friends

00:10:41.725 --> 00:10:44.660
know, but thousands of people
and more from around the world?

00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:46.550
And it wasn't until
very late in the game

00:10:46.550 --> 00:10:48.300
they were about to
call a media conference

00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:50.780
and cancel their idea or
suspend it for a while,

00:10:50.780 --> 00:10:53.300
that they got an unanticipated
phone call from American

00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:56.390
Express that said, we heard
what you guys were doing

00:10:56.390 --> 00:10:58.580
and let us tell you that
as citizens of New York

00:10:58.580 --> 00:11:00.320
and people who were
impacted tragically

00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:03.140
by the disaster of
9/11, we have a passion

00:11:03.140 --> 00:11:04.970
and commitment to
revitalizing the city too

00:11:04.970 --> 00:11:07.070
that transcends
conventional commerce.

00:11:07.070 --> 00:11:09.274
We want to help you
make this festival real.

00:11:09.274 --> 00:11:11.690
And one of the first questions
that American Express asked

00:11:11.690 --> 00:11:13.460
the founders of
Tribeca is, but we

00:11:13.460 --> 00:11:15.470
need to know your three
and five-year plan.

00:11:15.470 --> 00:11:17.780
To which their answer was, we
don't have a three-to-five-year

00:11:17.780 --> 00:11:18.210
plan.

00:11:18.210 --> 00:11:19.626
We don't even know
how we're going

00:11:19.626 --> 00:11:21.860
to raise a million dollars
to market this thing.

00:11:21.860 --> 00:11:22.910
And so they collaborated.

00:11:22.910 --> 00:11:25.920
American Express have been their
partner for a number of years.

00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:28.010
They built the program
from the ground up.

00:11:28.010 --> 00:11:30.500
Today it's far more
a film festival.

00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:31.890
They're storytellers.

00:11:31.890 --> 00:11:33.720
They're storytellers in film.

00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:35.640
They're storytellers
in literature.

00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:38.610
They use high technology to
advance storytelling as well.

00:11:38.610 --> 00:11:40.710
They're toying with the
idea of taking film out

00:11:40.710 --> 00:11:42.390
of the name of the festival.

00:11:42.390 --> 00:11:45.000
And they see Tribeca as being
much more of a cultural event.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.030
And even though the city
to the casual onlooker

00:11:48.030 --> 00:11:52.969
looks healed, in a sense, they
don't ever imagine a scenario

00:11:52.969 --> 00:11:55.260
where New York will not need
the assistance and support

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:57.630
of a program, like
Tribeca, to bring

00:11:57.630 --> 00:12:00.570
more attention and community
and interest in the city.

00:12:00.570 --> 00:12:02.430
They make a reasonable
amount of money.

00:12:02.430 --> 00:12:05.640
They have very healthy iconic
partners, automotive partners

00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:09.090
and so on that put a good amount
of capital into the program,

00:12:09.090 --> 00:12:10.740
but each year they
begin with, what

00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:13.680
positive impact do we want to
have on the city of New York?

00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:16.740
And as a consequence,
everything falls out of that.

00:12:16.740 --> 00:12:19.480
And I loved how we summed it up
in the book, which is to say,

00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:21.480
there are people who take
leadership personally,

00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:23.400
and there are people who
take work personally.

00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:26.016
They don't talk about
maximizing shareholder revenue.

00:12:26.016 --> 00:12:27.390
They're looking
at a higher order

00:12:27.390 --> 00:12:31.020
of return, which is personal
satisfaction, gratification,

00:12:31.020 --> 00:12:34.317
cultural rejuvenation, and more.

00:12:34.317 --> 00:12:36.400
LUCAS CONLEY: So from
Long-term Personal Ambition,

00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:39.340
which is the first chapter,
to Behaving Your Beliefs,

00:12:39.340 --> 00:12:43.260
which is the second chapter,
you have kind of the arc of--

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:46.140
you can have one person with
a long-term personal ambition

00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:49.560
or a dream, but rarely do you
see modern legacy builders who

00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:50.260
do it alone.

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:51.780
We see groups and
teams that build

00:12:51.780 --> 00:12:53.950
around values and beliefs.

00:12:53.950 --> 00:12:57.060
So the second chapter focuses
on beliefs and values.

00:12:57.060 --> 00:12:59.730
And traditionally, what you
see in the business world

00:12:59.730 --> 00:13:03.660
today with brand managers or
business managers is they're

00:13:03.660 --> 00:13:06.134
accustomed to saying one
thing and doing another.

00:13:06.134 --> 00:13:08.550
Fortunately, we live in a more
and more transparent world.

00:13:08.550 --> 00:13:11.790
Consumers are demanding that
the brands that they purchase,

00:13:11.790 --> 00:13:14.790
the brands they follow actually
have the same values that they

00:13:14.790 --> 00:13:16.420
do.

00:13:16.420 --> 00:13:18.960
And those are what we would
call modern legacy brands.

00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:21.985
And one of those is
The Bluebird Cafe.

00:13:21.985 --> 00:13:23.770
The Bluebird Cafe
is in Nashville.

00:13:23.770 --> 00:13:25.478
It's one of the most
famous country music

00:13:25.478 --> 00:13:26.760
venues in the world.

00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:30.334
Like Tribeca, it
didn't start out

00:13:30.334 --> 00:13:31.500
with its modern realization.

00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:33.350
It started out it as
just a restaurant.

00:13:33.350 --> 00:13:36.190
It had a lunch service
and there was no music.

00:13:36.190 --> 00:13:39.139
And it was 1982, and
the founder Amy Kurland

00:13:39.139 --> 00:13:41.680
had inherited this small amount
of money from her grandmother

00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:43.062
and decided to open this cafe.

00:13:43.062 --> 00:13:44.520
And as the years
went by, she said,

00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:47.070
I want to educate myself
about how to run a business.

00:13:47.070 --> 00:13:49.020
And she went to
community college

00:13:49.020 --> 00:13:50.430
and took a variety of courses.

00:13:50.430 --> 00:13:52.200
And the one that
really stuck for her

00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:54.420
was a marketing course
where they instructed her

00:13:54.420 --> 00:13:56.460
to do one thing really well.

00:13:56.460 --> 00:14:00.270
And what she realized
about her cafe

00:14:00.270 --> 00:14:03.700
is that she had let her
boyfriend play at the cafe

00:14:03.700 --> 00:14:04.200
once.

00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:05.704
He was in a band.

00:14:05.704 --> 00:14:06.870
They'd set up a small stage.

00:14:06.870 --> 00:14:08.494
And she realized the
people were really

00:14:08.494 --> 00:14:09.960
gravitating towards the music.

00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:12.900
So over time, the
lunch services dropped.

00:14:12.900 --> 00:14:15.750
They'd doubled the
evening performances

00:14:15.750 --> 00:14:18.720
so that they'd have a
performance for new musicians

00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:20.730
as well as musicians
who are established.

00:14:20.730 --> 00:14:22.320
And it really took off.

00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:26.464
And she had to stick to that as
the brand grew because she only

00:14:26.464 --> 00:14:27.880
had a hundred seats
in this place.

00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:30.088
She could have taken it
somewhere else, into a bigger

00:14:30.088 --> 00:14:32.055
location, and
really, essentially,

00:14:32.055 --> 00:14:33.930
sold out and made a lot
more money with this,

00:14:33.930 --> 00:14:36.244
but it would have destroyed
this vision of this brand

00:14:36.244 --> 00:14:38.160
that she had where she
had created a listening

00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:41.970
space for artists who
walked in off the street.

00:14:41.970 --> 00:14:45.360
Garth Brooks got off a bus and
actually got his first album

00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:47.340
signed at The Bluebird Cafe.

00:14:47.340 --> 00:14:49.200
Taylor Swift
launched her career.

00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:51.470
Those are the kind of
artists that come back, even

00:14:51.470 --> 00:14:54.030
with their fame, and have these
tiny performances in front

00:14:54.030 --> 00:14:55.770
of a hundred people
at this place.

00:14:55.770 --> 00:14:58.830
So she, over the years,
was able to maintain

00:14:58.830 --> 00:15:02.350
the sanctity, basically,
of this listening space.

00:15:02.350 --> 00:15:04.620
And it's telling, the
motto of The Bluebird Cafe

00:15:04.620 --> 00:15:07.590
is, shh, like they
basically create this space

00:15:07.590 --> 00:15:10.950
where they don't want people to
speak while the performers are

00:15:10.950 --> 00:15:12.720
performing.

00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:14.887
So they'll have--
bachelor or bachelorette

00:15:14.887 --> 00:15:17.220
parties will call and say,
can we book a bunch of seats?

00:15:17.220 --> 00:15:19.050
And they'll say, yeah,
but you can't talk.

00:15:19.050 --> 00:15:20.633
You're allowed to
come, but you're not

00:15:20.633 --> 00:15:22.350
allowed to make any noise.

00:15:22.350 --> 00:15:25.380
So they hold very
true to this value.

00:15:25.380 --> 00:15:27.710
And to the degree that
when Amy Kurland looked

00:15:27.710 --> 00:15:31.331
to retire in the past few years,
she decided rather than sell

00:15:31.331 --> 00:15:33.330
the brand for the most
possible amount of money,

00:15:33.330 --> 00:15:35.520
she would donate it to
the Nashville Songwriters

00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:36.594
Association.

00:15:36.594 --> 00:15:38.010
So she called up
a former employee

00:15:38.010 --> 00:15:40.357
of The Bluebird, who
worked there, and said,

00:15:40.357 --> 00:15:41.940
hey, listen, I know
that whoever takes

00:15:41.940 --> 00:15:43.970
this over won't be able to
protect it like you guys could.

00:15:43.970 --> 00:15:46.050
What if I just donate it
to you and you continue

00:15:46.050 --> 00:15:48.000
in the tradition that I set up?

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.550
And they said, we'll pay
you a fair price for it,

00:15:50.550 --> 00:15:51.670
and took it over.

00:15:51.670 --> 00:15:53.910
And in fact, have even
carried its fame forward,

00:15:53.910 --> 00:15:56.490
while maintaining the
culture that she built.

00:15:56.490 --> 00:15:58.394
There was a show
called "Nashville,"

00:15:58.394 --> 00:16:00.060
that you may have
heard of, The Bluebird

00:16:00.060 --> 00:16:02.160
is essentially a
character in that show.

00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:05.455
Whenever they're looking
to bring the drama down,

00:16:05.455 --> 00:16:08.040
they have a performance
in The Bluebird.

00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:10.440
And The Bluebird now has
performances in London

00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:12.360
on a pretty regular basis.

00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:14.520
They have performances
in Sundance every year.

00:16:14.520 --> 00:16:16.980
So the brand has
grown organically,

00:16:16.980 --> 00:16:19.890
but it has stayed true
to that core value--

00:16:19.890 --> 00:16:23.520
that belief in protecting
this space where musicians

00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:26.130
can perform and be heard,
not only famous musicians,

00:16:26.130 --> 00:16:29.670
but people who are trying
to start their careers.

00:16:29.670 --> 00:16:31.854
So that is kind of
the second circle

00:16:31.854 --> 00:16:33.270
of second chapter
of the book that

00:16:33.270 --> 00:16:35.025
builds out from the
long-term personal ambition.

00:16:35.025 --> 00:16:36.540
Do you want to talk
about the third?

00:16:36.540 --> 00:16:36.720
MARK MILLER: Yeah.

00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:38.760
So we begin with taking
leadership personally,

00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:41.820
and we move into this notion
of behaving your beliefs.

00:16:41.820 --> 00:16:43.890
The next section of the
book gets in this idea

00:16:43.890 --> 00:16:45.200
of letting outsiders in.

00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:46.850
And the iconic story
we like to share

00:16:46.850 --> 00:16:49.140
is a brand and a
platform you may

00:16:49.140 --> 00:16:51.030
have heard of called,
It Gets Better,

00:16:51.030 --> 00:16:53.130
which was developed
by Dan Savage.

00:16:53.130 --> 00:16:56.730
And what's amazing about it
is by conventional standards

00:16:56.730 --> 00:16:58.950
it should never have
worked because they never

00:16:58.950 --> 00:17:03.000
designed a program which was,
here's the inner workings.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:04.380
These are our consumers.

00:17:04.380 --> 00:17:05.725
And here's what we control.

00:17:05.725 --> 00:17:07.349
And here's what they
take because we've

00:17:07.349 --> 00:17:08.760
packaged it that way.

00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:11.790
From the get-go, their
intention was to create an idea

00:17:11.790 --> 00:17:13.740
and unleash it upon the world.

00:17:13.740 --> 00:17:16.079
And their language was to
become very uncomfortable

00:17:16.079 --> 00:17:18.780
with the idea, or rather
to become very comfortable

00:17:18.780 --> 00:17:20.322
with the idea of
being uncomfortable.

00:17:20.322 --> 00:17:22.738
They didn't care that people
were going to take their idea

00:17:22.738 --> 00:17:23.500
and mess with it.

00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:25.810
In fact, that was their design.

00:17:25.810 --> 00:17:28.410
So the famous story
goes like this--

00:17:28.410 --> 00:17:30.240
in and around 2010,
a young man named

00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:33.540
Billy Lucas was bullied at
school for being different.

00:17:33.540 --> 00:17:36.060
That the other kids
perceived him to be queer.

00:17:36.060 --> 00:17:39.030
And they bullied him to the
point that he killed himself.

00:17:39.030 --> 00:17:42.600
And not only was that a sort
of horrific outcome and story,

00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:45.300
but the same kids that bullied
him went onto his Facebook page

00:17:45.300 --> 00:17:48.180
after he died and continued
to effectively bully

00:17:48.180 --> 00:17:50.370
him and insult him in
front of his family.

00:17:50.370 --> 00:17:53.070
And that enraged a
journalist by the name

00:17:53.070 --> 00:17:55.470
of Dan Savage, that had
a popular column called

00:17:55.470 --> 00:17:56.850
"Savage Love."

00:17:56.850 --> 00:17:58.560
And he wrote in a
rage post, which

00:17:58.560 --> 00:18:00.930
is it's horrible that
these young kids would make

00:18:00.930 --> 00:18:04.140
another boy or any
young person feel

00:18:04.140 --> 00:18:05.910
so badly for being
different that they

00:18:05.910 --> 00:18:07.740
would want to kill themselves.

00:18:07.740 --> 00:18:10.630
And a reader of the story
wrote back and said,

00:18:10.630 --> 00:18:13.440
I wish I knew, Billy Lucas,
because I would have told you

00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:14.670
that it gets better.

00:18:14.670 --> 00:18:16.364
That effectively,
as life moves on

00:18:16.364 --> 00:18:18.030
and you have the
benefit of perspective,

00:18:18.030 --> 00:18:21.390
and as you get an older,
sort of wiser point of view,

00:18:21.390 --> 00:18:22.890
you'll realize that
these are silly,

00:18:22.890 --> 00:18:25.980
foolish kids that shouldn't have
had this kind of impact on you.

00:18:25.980 --> 00:18:27.630
And that language
stuck with Dan.

00:18:27.630 --> 00:18:30.932
And him and his partner,
Terry Miller, created a video.

00:18:30.932 --> 00:18:33.390
And so they did something that
was very modern at the time.

00:18:33.390 --> 00:18:36.270
They used social tools that
other programs and platforms

00:18:36.270 --> 00:18:39.100
were ignoring to say we
don't need to be censored.

00:18:39.100 --> 00:18:42.330
We can just put out in the world
what we think and their ideas.

00:18:42.330 --> 00:18:44.801
They would record
a video suggesting

00:18:44.801 --> 00:18:46.800
what life would look like
from the point of view

00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:48.330
of an adult with wisdom.

00:18:48.330 --> 00:18:49.950
And they were hoping
that maybe they'd

00:18:49.950 --> 00:18:52.530
get 10 other videos
or 100 other videos.

00:18:52.530 --> 00:18:55.530
And what, of course, transpired
is 1,000 video responses

00:18:55.530 --> 00:18:59.730
in a week, more than 60,000
video responses, currently.

00:18:59.730 --> 00:19:02.580
More than 60 million views
of those videos, currently.

00:19:02.580 --> 00:19:04.080
And some pretty
influential people

00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:09.670
have taken control, from Obama
to Lady Gaga to popular culture

00:19:09.670 --> 00:19:11.910
and programming, like "The
Office" did a piece on It

00:19:11.910 --> 00:19:13.560
Gets Better as well.

00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:16.422
And Dan had talked about how
even other advocate groups

00:19:16.422 --> 00:19:18.630
had a real problem with the
fact that these guys were

00:19:18.630 --> 00:19:21.930
using social media to tell their
story and reach young kids.

00:19:21.930 --> 00:19:25.860
And his point was, I embrace
the ideals and the values

00:19:25.860 --> 00:19:28.646
of creating change, but if
modern technology and tools

00:19:28.646 --> 00:19:30.270
have evolved to allow
me to reach more,

00:19:30.270 --> 00:19:32.070
why would I not use them?

00:19:32.070 --> 00:19:35.374
Those are rules, but they're
bad rules, so let's change them.

00:19:35.374 --> 00:19:37.290
He also talks passionately
about what he calls

00:19:37.290 --> 00:19:38.670
making a doable difference.

00:19:38.670 --> 00:19:41.010
And his belief is in
the world of advocacy

00:19:41.010 --> 00:19:43.260
too many brands ask
consumers to do things

00:19:43.260 --> 00:19:45.330
that sound like the impossible.

00:19:45.330 --> 00:19:47.700
If only we could raise
a billion dollars.

00:19:47.700 --> 00:19:50.430
If only we could collect
this amount of blood.

00:19:50.430 --> 00:19:52.680
If only we could take
this amount of guns away.

00:19:52.680 --> 00:19:55.470
And people feel powerless
in that conversation.

00:19:55.470 --> 00:19:58.140
And his point was to
unleash ideas and tools that

00:19:58.140 --> 00:20:00.810
made people feel that
they could participate

00:20:00.810 --> 00:20:02.327
and that they could have a hand.

00:20:02.327 --> 00:20:04.160
His language was give
people the opportunity

00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:06.040
to make a doable difference.

00:20:06.040 --> 00:20:10.350
And as a consequence, It Gets
Better continues to grow.

00:20:10.350 --> 00:20:12.867
We talked to him about the
notion of, do you ever imagine

00:20:12.867 --> 00:20:15.450
in a world where we won't need
an It Gets Better, and he said,

00:20:15.450 --> 00:20:16.080
no.

00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:18.480
The form may change,
but the notion of hate

00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:19.575
seems like it'll persist.

00:20:19.575 --> 00:20:22.800
So we're always going to need
tools and the benefit of wisdom

00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:25.860
from adults who can say, this
is how you deal and cope.

00:20:25.860 --> 00:20:29.670
And his point of view on calling
It Gets Better a brand is he's

00:20:29.670 --> 00:20:30.460
against it.

00:20:30.460 --> 00:20:32.430
He doesn't think the
old confines and rules

00:20:32.430 --> 00:20:35.820
of branding an organization
are what helps us succeed.

00:20:35.820 --> 00:20:38.239
He thinks you need to
set it free in the world.

00:20:38.239 --> 00:20:40.530
So if chapter 1 was about
taking leadership personally,

00:20:40.530 --> 00:20:42.446
and chapter 2 is around
behaving your beliefs,

00:20:42.446 --> 00:20:44.580
the third chapter is
really about unleashing

00:20:44.580 --> 00:20:47.776
ideas in the world and rolling
consumers as owners of ideas.

00:20:47.776 --> 00:20:49.650
And effectively, I think,
the language we use

00:20:49.650 --> 00:20:51.914
is letting outsiders in.

00:20:51.914 --> 00:20:52.830
LUCAS CONLEY: Mm-hmm.

00:20:52.830 --> 00:20:55.110
So from that we branch
into chapter four,

00:20:55.110 --> 00:20:58.020
which talks about
unconventionality,

00:20:58.020 --> 00:20:59.462
staying different.

00:20:59.462 --> 00:21:01.670
The story that we wanted to
share with you guys today

00:21:01.670 --> 00:21:02.836
is about the Belmont Stakes.

00:21:02.836 --> 00:21:06.360
This is a brand
that's 150 years old.

00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:09.120
Kind of like the original
must-see event in America.

00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:10.870
It's the third race
in the Triple Crown,

00:21:10.870 --> 00:21:12.786
so it gets a lot of
attention, especially when

00:21:12.786 --> 00:21:14.870
there's a Triple Crown
race up for grabs.

00:21:14.870 --> 00:21:18.554
And one of the issues that
the Belmont Stakes and all

00:21:18.554 --> 00:21:20.970
of horse racing is facing is
that horse racing has kind of

00:21:20.970 --> 00:21:23.010
lost a generation of fans.

00:21:23.010 --> 00:21:25.950
It's not nearly as popular
as the NBA or the NFL.

00:21:25.950 --> 00:21:29.370
There are a lot of sports
that have drawn people away

00:21:29.370 --> 00:21:31.120
for a variety of
different reasons.

00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:34.534
So Chris Kay, the refounder
of the Belmont Stakes--

00:21:34.534 --> 00:21:36.950
which is a term we use for
people who've come to take over

00:21:36.950 --> 00:21:40.770
brands after they've
been around for a while--

00:21:40.770 --> 00:21:43.610
had his hands full when
he came on board in 2014,

00:21:43.610 --> 00:21:45.330
looking at what can
we do to get people

00:21:45.330 --> 00:21:48.930
either to stick with the sport
or to come back into the sport?

00:21:48.930 --> 00:21:51.240
So we start the story
in the book, in 2014,

00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:53.850
with the racing of
the 2014 Triple Crown.

00:21:53.850 --> 00:21:57.570
California Chrome was
up for the Triple Crown.

00:21:57.570 --> 00:21:59.040
Didn't actually win.

00:21:59.040 --> 00:22:03.000
And so the disappointment
was magnified by the fact

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:05.220
that 110,000 people
were at this event

00:22:05.220 --> 00:22:06.770
and couldn't basically get out.

00:22:06.770 --> 00:22:10.710
The train stations were not
set up for that kind of crowd.

00:22:10.710 --> 00:22:13.440
The roads were
completely packed.

00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:16.590
And Chris was in his first
year running this event said

00:22:16.590 --> 00:22:18.090
something has to change.

00:22:18.090 --> 00:22:21.240
So the following day, he
did what a traditional brand

00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:22.380
manager would not do.

00:22:22.380 --> 00:22:24.671
I think a traditional brand
manager would look for ways

00:22:24.671 --> 00:22:28.056
to cut money out of the
system and sell tickets,

00:22:28.056 --> 00:22:29.430
sell as many
tickets as possible.

00:22:29.430 --> 00:22:32.617
So maybe we can invest
in more seating.

00:22:32.617 --> 00:22:34.950
He decided, we're going to
sell fewer tickets next year,

00:22:34.950 --> 00:22:38.280
and we're going to invest in
making this a better experience

00:22:38.280 --> 00:22:40.770
for the people who come,
both who see it on television

00:22:40.770 --> 00:22:42.900
as well as who
come to the event.

00:22:42.900 --> 00:22:46.890
So of course, things like HD
cameras and HD televisions

00:22:46.890 --> 00:22:50.640
were deployed all around the
stadium where the event's held,

00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:52.650
bringing the sport
kind of up to the level

00:22:52.650 --> 00:22:55.500
that you see in the
NFL and the NBA.

00:22:55.500 --> 00:22:56.940
The experience was improved by--

00:22:56.940 --> 00:22:58.740
I think they cut maybe 20,000?

00:22:58.740 --> 00:23:02.280
Something along that,
around 20,000 tickets out

00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:03.780
of the sales.

00:23:03.780 --> 00:23:04.950
So far fewer people came.

00:23:04.950 --> 00:23:07.325
It made it a more enjoyable
experience for everybody that

00:23:07.325 --> 00:23:10.140
was able to come to the race.

00:23:10.140 --> 00:23:12.080
And really what he
was looking to do

00:23:12.080 --> 00:23:14.389
was looking outside
his category.

00:23:14.389 --> 00:23:16.680
So rather than stick to the
conventions of horse racing

00:23:16.680 --> 00:23:19.690
and just copying what
the Kentucky Derby does,

00:23:19.690 --> 00:23:23.550
for example, he looked to
what other major sports do.

00:23:23.550 --> 00:23:25.650
What Vegas does.

00:23:25.650 --> 00:23:27.666
Looked to entertainment.

00:23:27.666 --> 00:23:29.040
One of his best
ideas that I love

00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:31.870
is he brought in a
concert, an A-list band.

00:23:31.870 --> 00:23:34.740
I think, the Goo Goo Dolls
performed the very first time

00:23:34.740 --> 00:23:38.430
right after the next
year's Triple Crown race.

00:23:38.430 --> 00:23:41.462
That way people stuck
around even after the race.

00:23:41.462 --> 00:23:43.920
Some didn't actually get in
their cars or hop on the trains

00:23:43.920 --> 00:23:45.786
and create as much congestion.

00:23:45.786 --> 00:23:47.160
So it's just these
little touches

00:23:47.160 --> 00:23:51.870
that really made the
event that much better.

00:23:51.870 --> 00:23:54.870
But, also notably, he expanded
it from a one-day event

00:23:54.870 --> 00:23:57.570
to a three-day event so they
could move the races out

00:23:57.570 --> 00:23:59.580
and have a better distribution.

00:23:59.580 --> 00:24:02.220
So as you look at the
Belmont Stakes today,

00:24:02.220 --> 00:24:04.890
it's far more modern,
far more appealing

00:24:04.890 --> 00:24:08.490
to modern sports
consumers than it was even

00:24:08.490 --> 00:24:10.650
just five years ago.

00:24:10.650 --> 00:24:13.690
And so that really is about--

00:24:13.690 --> 00:24:15.330
the whole chapter
talks about how

00:24:15.330 --> 00:24:18.720
you maintain that unconventional
core that keeps people

00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:19.930
interested in your brand.

00:24:19.930 --> 00:24:21.390
MARK MILLER: So
as we wander away

00:24:21.390 --> 00:24:23.265
into the fifth and final
chapter of the book,

00:24:23.265 --> 00:24:25.170
the fifth and final
principle of the book,

00:24:25.170 --> 00:24:28.080
we started really with it's
all about a personal style

00:24:28.080 --> 00:24:29.910
and approach to leadership.

00:24:29.910 --> 00:24:32.830
We move our way to
organizations enroll themselves

00:24:32.830 --> 00:24:35.220
in those beliefs, where
brand leaders have

00:24:35.220 --> 00:24:36.750
to behave their
beliefs, and then

00:24:36.750 --> 00:24:38.910
organizations
bring outsiders in,

00:24:38.910 --> 00:24:40.930
and then behaving not
with the orthodoxy,

00:24:40.930 --> 00:24:42.817
but against the orthodoxy.

00:24:42.817 --> 00:24:44.400
The fifth and final
chapter is pivotal

00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:46.525
because it really talks
about not just doing things

00:24:46.525 --> 00:24:49.260
episodically, but doing
things perpetually.

00:24:49.260 --> 00:24:51.480
Lucas began today's
conversation with reference

00:24:51.480 --> 00:24:54.710
to Gibson guitars, and
Radio Shack, and Brookstone,

00:24:54.710 --> 00:24:56.940
and Necco candy-- brands
that at one point in time

00:24:56.940 --> 00:24:59.430
had done something
fascinating, but got

00:24:59.430 --> 00:25:01.770
stuck doing the same thing
repetitiously over time

00:25:01.770 --> 00:25:02.700
and didn't evolve.

00:25:02.700 --> 00:25:05.490
So instead of saying
the values persist,

00:25:05.490 --> 00:25:08.400
but the manifestations change,
they said, the values persist

00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:10.510
and the manifestations
persist as well,

00:25:10.510 --> 00:25:13.060
and ultimately they
become less relevant.

00:25:13.060 --> 00:25:16.140
So the iconic story we like to
tell here is Taylor Guitars.

00:25:16.140 --> 00:25:18.210
And as I shared
at the outset, I'm

00:25:18.210 --> 00:25:21.960
a musician, a failed
musician, but nonetheless I

00:25:21.960 --> 00:25:23.910
grew up having a reverence
for Taylor Guitars

00:25:23.910 --> 00:25:25.980
because it was a modern
company that came out

00:25:25.980 --> 00:25:29.040
of nowhere that unseated a
brand like Martin guitars, which

00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:31.032
had been around for
a very long time.

00:25:31.032 --> 00:25:33.240
And the reason they've
succeeded, in their own words,

00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:36.620
is because they always ask
themselves, in 10 years,

00:25:36.620 --> 00:25:38.730
in 10 years from
now, will we be happy

00:25:38.730 --> 00:25:41.340
that we make the choices
that we made today?

00:25:41.340 --> 00:25:43.120
And if the answer
is that in 10 years

00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:45.850
they will be happier, more
successful, more fulfilled,

00:25:45.850 --> 00:25:48.210
they make choices and
decisions in service

00:25:48.210 --> 00:25:49.740
of a 10-year outcome.

00:25:49.740 --> 00:25:51.840
So if they have to change
the way they distribute,

00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:52.500
they do it.

00:25:52.500 --> 00:25:55.015
They didn't buy into the
distribution system in Europe.

00:25:55.015 --> 00:25:55.890
They knocked it down.

00:25:55.890 --> 00:25:57.598
They built their own
distribution system.

00:25:57.598 --> 00:25:59.700
They learned about HR's
policies in Europe,

00:25:59.700 --> 00:26:01.200
and they invested
the time and money

00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:03.741
to do it because they felt that
owning their own distribution

00:26:03.741 --> 00:26:05.130
channel would make a difference.

00:26:05.130 --> 00:26:07.170
If they didn't like the
way materials were being

00:26:07.170 --> 00:26:10.080
manufactured in their guitars,
they invested in factories

00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:12.150
in Cameroon, and they
got involved in fair work

00:26:12.150 --> 00:26:13.634
practices and fair wages.

00:26:13.634 --> 00:26:15.300
And so they weren't
just making guitars,

00:26:15.300 --> 00:26:17.133
they were impacting the
way the guitars were

00:26:17.133 --> 00:26:18.960
being made from the outset.

00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:20.460
And they have a
lovely point of view

00:26:20.460 --> 00:26:23.910
that the way you carry ideas
forward for generations is you

00:26:23.910 --> 00:26:27.370
enroll the people who work with
you as family and co owners

00:26:27.370 --> 00:26:28.360
as well.

00:26:28.360 --> 00:26:31.110
So I'll give you some examples
that they shared with us.

00:26:31.110 --> 00:26:33.360
When the economy went to
bad, rather than laying off

00:26:33.360 --> 00:26:35.430
a substantial portion
of their workforce,

00:26:35.430 --> 00:26:37.500
they cut everyone
back to four days.

00:26:37.500 --> 00:26:40.050
And they got the group
together and instead of saying,

00:26:40.050 --> 00:26:42.722
some of you keep your jobs and
some of you lose their jobs,

00:26:42.722 --> 00:26:45.180
they said, we want everyone to
continue to be a part of it.

00:26:45.180 --> 00:26:47.480
So we're all going to
work four days, not five.

00:26:47.480 --> 00:26:49.230
And what they did not
tell their workforce

00:26:49.230 --> 00:26:52.572
is in the background they were
keeping track of lost wages.

00:26:52.572 --> 00:26:54.030
When the economy
went back to good,

00:26:54.030 --> 00:26:56.696
all those people who stayed with
them through the four days, got

00:26:56.696 --> 00:26:58.380
paid for that fifth
day and each one

00:26:58.380 --> 00:27:00.592
that they lost the
wages for before.

00:27:00.592 --> 00:27:02.550
The other thing that
they've subsequently done,

00:27:02.550 --> 00:27:05.250
which for us was fascinating,
and we got a lot of questions

00:27:05.250 --> 00:27:08.220
from the press about
it, is in real time

00:27:08.220 --> 00:27:11.250
they're picking the successor
of their brand today, who's

00:27:11.250 --> 00:27:13.987
cross-training with the
founder of the organization.

00:27:13.987 --> 00:27:16.320
So what they had observed is
a lot of guitar companies--

00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:20.090
and Gibson's a perfect example--

00:27:20.090 --> 00:27:23.650
look to build in volume and
take cost out of the system.

00:27:23.650 --> 00:27:26.420
So if Gibson once started as
the consequence or passion

00:27:26.420 --> 00:27:28.580
of someone who wanted to
build beautiful guitars,

00:27:28.580 --> 00:27:31.460
it became the output of
a marketing organization

00:27:31.460 --> 00:27:35.600
that would distribute widely
and distribute cheaply.

00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:37.490
And their point of
view is eventually

00:27:37.490 --> 00:27:40.130
that system is going to run
out of steam because what made

00:27:40.130 --> 00:27:42.650
brands like Fender
and Gibson so special

00:27:42.650 --> 00:27:44.774
wasn't wide distribution
and cheap cost.

00:27:44.774 --> 00:27:46.940
It's that those brands
actually had a story to tell,

00:27:46.940 --> 00:27:49.212
and values that they held dear.

00:27:49.212 --> 00:27:51.170
And so their point of
view is they're not going

00:27:51.170 --> 00:27:52.670
to sell to the highest bidder.

00:27:52.670 --> 00:27:56.460
They're going to turn employees
into co-owners of the brand.

00:27:56.460 --> 00:27:58.660
And they're going to build
their successor today.

00:27:58.660 --> 00:28:02.240
So a guy named Andy
Powers was found--

00:28:02.240 --> 00:28:03.260
after a long search.

00:28:03.260 --> 00:28:04.790
He works with Bob Taylor.

00:28:04.790 --> 00:28:06.860
They're designing
guitars together today.

00:28:06.860 --> 00:28:09.300
And it's in his
contract, effectively,

00:28:09.300 --> 00:28:11.180
that when Bob Taylor
moves on, Andy

00:28:11.180 --> 00:28:13.940
can't just reissue the old
guitars that are made today.

00:28:13.940 --> 00:28:15.536
He has to design and
build new guitars

00:28:15.536 --> 00:28:17.410
in the spirit of what
Taylor is always about.

00:28:17.410 --> 00:28:19.370
He has to bring
the brand forward.

00:28:19.370 --> 00:28:21.170
Contractually, it's
also his responsibility

00:28:21.170 --> 00:28:22.850
to find the next successor.

00:28:22.850 --> 00:28:26.262
So Andy, contractually, can't
just come in one day and say,

00:28:26.262 --> 00:28:28.220
I hate this place, or
I'm done with this place,

00:28:28.220 --> 00:28:29.420
and I'll see you later.

00:28:29.420 --> 00:28:31.350
In real time, just as
Bob Taylor has done,

00:28:31.350 --> 00:28:34.010
he has to find his successor
and train him or her

00:28:34.010 --> 00:28:36.219
and pass the values
and culture forward.

00:28:36.219 --> 00:28:38.510
And when you think about the
brands that maybe you work

00:28:38.510 --> 00:28:40.460
with-- and I think about the
brands that maybe we work

00:28:40.460 --> 00:28:41.100
with--

00:28:41.100 --> 00:28:43.532
I can't tell you that that's
a very common attitude

00:28:43.532 --> 00:28:44.240
in the slightest.

00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:46.760
The vast majority of brands
are concerned with today.

00:28:46.760 --> 00:28:48.468
The vast majority of
brands are concerned

00:28:48.468 --> 00:28:52.100
with quarterly reporting,
maximizing shareholder revenue.

00:28:52.100 --> 00:28:53.870
It's the few, not
the many, that think

00:28:53.870 --> 00:28:57.320
about growing cultures and
values first and finding ways

00:28:57.320 --> 00:28:59.480
to perpetuate it forward.

00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:01.730
We often get a lot of heads
nodding and people saying,

00:29:01.730 --> 00:29:04.220
it sounds ideal and
it sounds beautiful.

00:29:04.220 --> 00:29:06.850
Why is it that more brands
are not behaving this way?

00:29:06.850 --> 00:29:09.020
To which the answer
is because it's hard.

00:29:09.020 --> 00:29:11.270
Because when the
economy goes to bad,

00:29:11.270 --> 00:29:13.190
you're inclined to save money.

00:29:13.190 --> 00:29:15.320
Make more money, save money.

00:29:15.320 --> 00:29:16.560
Sell more product.

00:29:16.560 --> 00:29:19.250
Let go of staff
to save on wages.

00:29:19.250 --> 00:29:22.760
And these are companies that
are doubling down on culture.

00:29:22.760 --> 00:29:24.560
Lucas reminded me the
Ritz-Carlton actually

00:29:24.560 --> 00:29:26.180
had a lovely solution.

00:29:26.180 --> 00:29:27.740
When the economy
went to bad, they

00:29:27.740 --> 00:29:30.620
ran a campaign that
said to wealthy people--

00:29:30.620 --> 00:29:33.729
the ones who retained
their wealth-ish--

00:29:33.729 --> 00:29:36.020
if you can't take the vacation
that you want this year,

00:29:36.020 --> 00:29:37.460
you shouldn't go on vacation.

00:29:37.460 --> 00:29:41.780
Don't just spend money because
you think you need to spend it.

00:29:41.780 --> 00:29:46.130
Don't go on fewer vacations
to save and only to save.

00:29:46.130 --> 00:29:48.650
They effectively said get
your priorities right in life.

00:29:48.650 --> 00:29:50.520
Think about the things
that matter most.

00:29:50.520 --> 00:29:53.060
Where things matter most, spend
more time and money there.

00:29:53.060 --> 00:29:55.940
And where things matter
least, save your money,

00:29:55.940 --> 00:29:57.669
invest your time elsewhere.

00:29:57.669 --> 00:29:59.210
And those are brave
things for brands

00:29:59.210 --> 00:30:00.530
to take a leadership
point of view.

00:30:00.530 --> 00:30:02.113
The most surprising
fact of that story

00:30:02.113 --> 00:30:04.309
is of all the brands in
the Marriott portfolio,

00:30:04.309 --> 00:30:06.350
the Ritz-Carlton was the
number one leading brand

00:30:06.350 --> 00:30:08.690
in the down years
after a recession.

00:30:08.690 --> 00:30:11.360
The brand that charged the
most-- where really, a person

00:30:11.360 --> 00:30:14.136
could say, I could get a room
anywhere, a bedroom anywhere,

00:30:14.136 --> 00:30:15.260
a conference room anywhere.

00:30:15.260 --> 00:30:18.530
I could sleep in any hotel,
I don't need to go there--

00:30:18.530 --> 00:30:21.020
they got more revenue
per available room

00:30:21.020 --> 00:30:23.090
night from customers
because they held tight

00:30:23.090 --> 00:30:23.960
to their values.

00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:27.240
And they came out
recession on top.

00:30:27.240 --> 00:30:30.040
So I'll turn it over to Lucas
just to sum up the stories.

00:30:30.040 --> 00:30:31.100
We have another little
piece at the end

00:30:31.100 --> 00:30:32.349
that we'll talk about quickly.

00:30:32.349 --> 00:30:34.760
And very happy to
answer questions.

00:30:34.760 --> 00:30:37.015
It's a topic we're
very passionate about.

00:30:37.015 --> 00:30:38.390
And it's amazing
that in the time

00:30:38.390 --> 00:30:40.400
we've written the
book, as Lucas said,

00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:43.092
Necco bankruptcy,
RadioShack bankruptcy--

00:30:43.092 --> 00:30:45.050
LUCAS CONLEY: Second
bankruptcy in three years.

00:30:45.050 --> 00:30:47.600
MARK MILLER: --Blockbuster
down to basically--

00:30:47.600 --> 00:30:50.130
finally, near done.

00:30:50.130 --> 00:30:51.920
It's not a proud
moment to say we're

00:30:51.920 --> 00:30:54.772
at the cusp of what's
happening the world around us

00:30:54.772 --> 00:30:57.230
because what's happening around
us isn't a wonderful thing.

00:30:57.230 --> 00:30:58.813
Brands that we thought
would be around

00:30:58.813 --> 00:31:00.710
forever are disappearing.

00:31:00.710 --> 00:31:02.570
But it's a special
thing to have knowledge

00:31:02.570 --> 00:31:04.420
from the ones who
found ways to thrive.

00:31:04.420 --> 00:31:06.789
So I'll turn it over
to Lucas to sum it up.

00:31:06.789 --> 00:31:07.580
LUCAS CONLEY: Yeah.

00:31:07.580 --> 00:31:10.435
So the beginning
of the book process

00:31:10.435 --> 00:31:12.560
was really sitting down
with all these lessons, all

00:31:12.560 --> 00:31:13.730
these stories, and
starting to say,

00:31:13.730 --> 00:31:14.930
where are the common themes?

00:31:14.930 --> 00:31:16.138
Where are the chapter breaks?

00:31:16.138 --> 00:31:18.004
What are the takeaways for this?

00:31:18.004 --> 00:31:19.670
And what we started
to see was something

00:31:19.670 --> 00:31:21.800
we've come to call the
modern legacy mindset.

00:31:21.800 --> 00:31:25.160
And that's the five
core chapter ideas.

00:31:25.160 --> 00:31:27.050
Traditional brand
leaders will follow

00:31:27.050 --> 00:31:30.140
organizational principles,
institutional rules.

00:31:30.140 --> 00:31:32.150
What we found modern
legacy builders doing

00:31:32.150 --> 00:31:35.000
is following long-term
personal ambitions.

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:36.830
That's the first chapter.

00:31:36.830 --> 00:31:40.520
Traditional brand leaders will
lean into saying one thing,

00:31:40.520 --> 00:31:41.180
doing another.

00:31:41.180 --> 00:31:43.430
A lot of attitude,
a lot of posturing.

00:31:43.430 --> 00:31:45.150
Modern legacy
builders really behave

00:31:45.150 --> 00:31:47.130
their beliefs and their values.

00:31:47.130 --> 00:31:49.370
The third chapter about
letting outsiders in--

00:31:49.370 --> 00:31:52.840
traditional brand leaders follow
a command and control model.

00:31:52.840 --> 00:31:56.480
Still-- this is a very difficult
thing for modern brands to do.

00:31:56.480 --> 00:31:58.640
But modern legacy brands
step outside of that

00:31:58.640 --> 00:32:01.190
and let outsiders in
and really let consumers

00:32:01.190 --> 00:32:02.960
take a role in the brand.

00:32:02.960 --> 00:32:05.810
And they build a lot
of influence that way.

00:32:05.810 --> 00:32:08.390
The fourth chapter, I talked
about the Belmont Stakes.

00:32:08.390 --> 00:32:11.510
That's all about
being unconventional.

00:32:11.510 --> 00:32:14.000
Traditional brand leaders
will stick to their category

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:17.210
and follow the orthodox of
the business that they're in.

00:32:17.210 --> 00:32:20.420
Modern legacy brands are really
willing to break the category,

00:32:20.420 --> 00:32:24.360
be a category of one and
define their own category.

00:32:24.360 --> 00:32:25.860
And the fifth chapter
that Mark just

00:32:25.860 --> 00:32:28.235
spoke about with Taylor Guitars
is about being perpetual.

00:32:28.235 --> 00:32:30.600
A lot of brand leaders
will evolve episodically

00:32:30.600 --> 00:32:31.890
when they need to.

00:32:31.890 --> 00:32:34.680
Repeating what they do well
until it's absolutely necessary

00:32:34.680 --> 00:32:36.660
to completely change.

00:32:36.660 --> 00:32:40.230
And what we see is that brands,
like Gibson guitar, Toys "R"

00:32:40.230 --> 00:32:43.340
Us, Blockbuster,
they wait too long.

00:32:43.340 --> 00:32:45.420
And it's a short-term
mindset and you wind up

00:32:45.420 --> 00:32:48.570
seeing them go bankrupt
or out of business.

00:32:48.570 --> 00:32:49.980
Brand leaders, they're building.

00:32:49.980 --> 00:32:51.790
Modern legacies are
evolving all the time.

00:32:51.790 --> 00:32:54.409
It's a constant process.

00:32:54.409 --> 00:32:56.450
MARK MILLER: So now one
of the questions we often

00:32:56.450 --> 00:32:59.000
get asked is, it
all sounds so ideal,

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:00.800
but do these companies
make money as well,

00:33:00.800 --> 00:33:03.087
the ones that you studied?

00:33:03.087 --> 00:33:05.420
The balance, if not entirely
all the brands in the book,

00:33:05.420 --> 00:33:07.970
are brands that are succeeding,
in not just cultural terms,

00:33:07.970 --> 00:33:10.430
but financial terms.

00:33:10.430 --> 00:33:11.930
I'll share a story and a half.

00:33:11.930 --> 00:33:14.750
One is from a leader
in the first chapter,

00:33:14.750 --> 00:33:17.695
named Toni Ko, who launched
a brand called NYX Cosmetics.

00:33:17.695 --> 00:33:19.320
And she had a very
strong point of view

00:33:19.320 --> 00:33:21.660
that as a leader, of course,
you want to lead with culture

00:33:21.660 --> 00:33:23.090
and values, but you
need to make money

00:33:23.090 --> 00:33:25.370
as well because money allows
you to hire people, grow,

00:33:25.370 --> 00:33:26.195
pay health care.

00:33:26.195 --> 00:33:28.070
Who wants to work for
a leader that tells you

00:33:28.070 --> 00:33:29.320
they don't want to make money?

00:33:29.320 --> 00:33:32.210
So our thinking
philosophy is not do good

00:33:32.210 --> 00:33:33.150
and don't make money.

00:33:33.150 --> 00:33:35.390
Our philosophy, I think
very much, is do good,

00:33:35.390 --> 00:33:37.560
and as a consequence, other
good things will happen,

00:33:37.560 --> 00:33:38.997
including making money.

00:33:38.997 --> 00:33:40.580
The other piece that
I wanted to share

00:33:40.580 --> 00:33:45.050
is the forward for the book
is definitely worth reading.

00:33:45.050 --> 00:33:47.616
We'll tell you how to get a
copy of the book next week,

00:33:47.616 --> 00:33:49.490
but if you haven't read
the book and you just

00:33:49.490 --> 00:33:51.364
want to see a tease,
we can send you a link.

00:33:51.364 --> 00:33:53.030
The forward from the
book is now online.

00:33:53.030 --> 00:33:54.404
It was written by
Yvon Chouinard.

00:33:54.404 --> 00:33:56.690
He is the founder of Patagonia.

00:33:56.690 --> 00:34:02.180
And Yvon, in the past year,
became famous once again,

00:34:02.180 --> 00:34:06.950
a famous guy, for posting
on his for-sale website,

00:34:06.950 --> 00:34:09.170
his commercial
website, the Patagonia

00:34:09.170 --> 00:34:11.510
brand, that the president
just stole your land.

00:34:11.510 --> 00:34:13.659
And so you could agree
with his politics or not.

00:34:13.659 --> 00:34:16.142
We're not taking
a stand on that,

00:34:16.142 --> 00:34:17.600
but what we will
take a stand on is

00:34:17.600 --> 00:34:19.670
he's a guy that put
his values out front.

00:34:19.670 --> 00:34:21.530
He said my brand believes
in nature and park

00:34:21.530 --> 00:34:23.600
lands and the ability
to enjoy them today

00:34:23.600 --> 00:34:25.247
and for generations to come.

00:34:25.247 --> 00:34:27.080
And I perceive the
government is threatening

00:34:27.080 --> 00:34:28.639
what my brand holds dear.

00:34:28.639 --> 00:34:30.469
And so right up on
his home page he said,

00:34:30.469 --> 00:34:32.540
the president stole your land.

00:34:32.540 --> 00:34:34.239
As it turns out,
in that same year,

00:34:34.239 --> 00:34:37.250
it was the most profitable year
that Patagonia has ever had.

00:34:37.250 --> 00:34:41.810
So for the ones who question
the value of good ethics

00:34:41.810 --> 00:34:45.110
and high ideals and
long-term ambition,

00:34:45.110 --> 00:34:47.270
he is proof positive
that you can do it

00:34:47.270 --> 00:34:50.294
at a very high level while
being very successful as well.

00:34:50.294 --> 00:34:51.710
The last thing
that I'll leave you

00:34:51.710 --> 00:34:53.126
with before we
sort of open it up,

00:34:53.126 --> 00:34:57.305
if there happen to be questions,
is we often get asked by folks

00:34:57.305 --> 00:34:59.180
how can they get involved
in some of the work

00:34:59.180 --> 00:35:00.170
that we're doing.

00:35:00.170 --> 00:35:01.880
We never started out
with the ambition

00:35:01.880 --> 00:35:03.920
of a for-profit
business, but we've

00:35:03.920 --> 00:35:06.310
been approached about
helping people with branding.

00:35:06.310 --> 00:35:08.460
So we do that gladly.

00:35:08.460 --> 00:35:10.010
We didn't begin with
the idea that we

00:35:10.010 --> 00:35:11.135
were going to write a book.

00:35:11.135 --> 00:35:12.770
We began researching in earnest.

00:35:12.770 --> 00:35:14.390
As I said, I was
about to become a dad

00:35:14.390 --> 00:35:17.930
and I wanted to learn from
people that I admired.

00:35:17.930 --> 00:35:20.949
And yet, it became such
an interesting topic,

00:35:20.949 --> 00:35:22.490
that every time we
spoke to a leader,

00:35:22.490 --> 00:35:24.024
they'd refer us to a friend.

00:35:24.024 --> 00:35:25.940
They'd ask for a transcript
because they never

00:35:25.940 --> 00:35:27.732
told the story before.

00:35:27.732 --> 00:35:29.690
And so here are ways that
you can get involved.

00:35:29.690 --> 00:35:31.790
If you have a story
that you think

00:35:31.790 --> 00:35:35.160
is worth covering,
please share it with us.

00:35:35.160 --> 00:35:37.540
The book has brands that are
a hundred years and older,

00:35:37.540 --> 00:35:39.150
and has brands that are
10 years and younger.

00:35:39.150 --> 00:35:40.650
It has brands that
are 40 years old.

00:35:40.650 --> 00:35:42.284
Our philosophy is
legacy is something

00:35:42.284 --> 00:35:44.450
you write every day because
you're either writing it

00:35:44.450 --> 00:35:47.090
every day, or you become
a part of ancient history.

00:35:47.090 --> 00:35:48.955
People read what you once did.

00:35:48.955 --> 00:35:51.320
So if you know someone,
please share it with us.

00:35:51.320 --> 00:35:52.880
If you happen to
have a story that's

00:35:52.880 --> 00:35:56.932
your personal story, your
work here, or a side hustle,

00:35:56.932 --> 00:35:57.640
share it with us.

00:35:57.640 --> 00:35:59.270
We're interested in that.

00:35:59.270 --> 00:36:02.000
The other thing that we've done
is we've created a foundation.

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:03.722
So our commitment
was, yet again,

00:36:03.722 --> 00:36:05.930
because we weren't doing
this strictly to make money,

00:36:05.930 --> 00:36:08.030
or initially, ever
to make money,

00:36:08.030 --> 00:36:09.740
was that anytime
something good happened,

00:36:09.740 --> 00:36:13.200
we'd reinvest it in people
who live and work this way.

00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:16.820
So two years ago, we ran a
program called Legacy Honors.

00:36:16.820 --> 00:36:18.380
David Remnick from
"The New Yorker"

00:36:18.380 --> 00:36:20.566
was a recipient, as a
Refounder of the Year.

00:36:20.566 --> 00:36:22.190
And before he
collaborated on our book,

00:36:22.190 --> 00:36:25.079
Yvon was a Founder of the Year.

00:36:25.079 --> 00:36:27.620
And they got bursaries that they
passed forward to businesses

00:36:27.620 --> 00:36:29.580
that they felt should
persist for a long time.

00:36:29.580 --> 00:36:32.540
So Yvon gave $10,000 to
Doctors Without Borders

00:36:32.540 --> 00:36:35.072
because he felt that health
care is a basic human right.

00:36:35.072 --> 00:36:37.280
And if you're an adventurer,
you may need health care

00:36:37.280 --> 00:36:38.330
at some point.

00:36:38.330 --> 00:36:40.910
And David gave his to the
Committee to Protect Journalism

00:36:40.910 --> 00:36:43.370
because he felt in the
environment that we operate in,

00:36:43.370 --> 00:36:44.820
journalists were not
getting their fair do

00:36:44.820 --> 00:36:46.790
and they were putting
their lives on the line.

00:36:46.790 --> 00:36:49.280
And he passed $10,000
forward to them.

00:36:49.280 --> 00:36:51.950
Next week, on the
28th of the month--

00:36:51.950 --> 00:36:55.280
almost right around the corner
at our agency called Team One--

00:36:55.280 --> 00:36:56.960
with "Inc." magazine,
were announcing

00:36:56.960 --> 00:36:59.390
the first-ever young,
effectively, young legacy

00:36:59.390 --> 00:36:59.984
makers.

00:36:59.984 --> 00:37:02.150
The ones who don't have
fully formed and established

00:37:02.150 --> 00:37:03.920
businesses, but who
are making active

00:37:03.920 --> 00:37:07.690
change to the way culture and
society work and behave today.

00:37:07.690 --> 00:37:09.000
There are five recipients.

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:11.300
There are two young activists
who are 11 years old,

00:37:11.300 --> 00:37:13.341
who have been in the news
a fair amount recently.

00:37:13.341 --> 00:37:15.230
There are two slightly
older, but still young

00:37:15.230 --> 00:37:20.270
activists who got notoriety
on a "Forbes" list.

00:37:20.270 --> 00:37:23.300
And there's a young
interesting filmmaker,

00:37:23.300 --> 00:37:26.360
who's gotten notoriety at
the Sundance Film Festival.

00:37:26.360 --> 00:37:28.710
We're passing forward
grants to them as well.

00:37:28.710 --> 00:37:30.470
So if you're curious
to come hear more--

00:37:30.470 --> 00:37:31.820
either more about
the book, and we're

00:37:31.820 --> 00:37:33.278
giving away free
copies of the book

00:37:33.278 --> 00:37:34.502
if you'd like that evening--

00:37:34.502 --> 00:37:36.710
or to hear the stories about
the young legacy makers,

00:37:36.710 --> 00:37:38.793
we'd love to have you or
your colleagues and peers

00:37:38.793 --> 00:37:39.770
come and join us.

00:37:39.770 --> 00:37:41.590
And with that, on
behalf of Lucas and me,

00:37:41.590 --> 00:37:44.090
I just want to say thank you
for giving us some of your time

00:37:44.090 --> 00:37:45.788
today and joining us.

00:37:45.788 --> 00:37:46.913
LUCAS CONLEY: Thanks, guys.

00:37:46.913 --> 00:37:49.328
[APPLAUSE]

00:37:50.294 --> 00:37:52.870
SPEAKER: So we have
some time for questions.

00:37:52.870 --> 00:37:56.760
If you have a question, I will
toss this in your direction

00:37:56.760 --> 00:37:59.350
and pass on a microphone.

00:37:59.350 --> 00:38:02.398
Want to catch it?

00:38:02.398 --> 00:38:03.880
Do you want the microphone?

00:38:03.880 --> 00:38:04.440
AUDIENCE: No, this is good.

00:38:04.440 --> 00:38:04.950
This is a microphone.

00:38:04.950 --> 00:38:05.850
SPEAKER: Oh, it is?

00:38:05.850 --> 00:38:07.650
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:38:07.650 --> 00:38:11.284
I have like three questions,
but I'll ease into them

00:38:11.284 --> 00:38:12.575
and give other people a chance.

00:38:12.575 --> 00:38:16.140
It was a really
interesting talk.

00:38:16.140 --> 00:38:20.070
I'm wondering how much the
advancement of technology

00:38:20.070 --> 00:38:24.920
and the internet, and how
much that has made things

00:38:24.920 --> 00:38:28.940
move much more quickly,
has impacted maybe

00:38:28.940 --> 00:38:31.550
the newer brands that
are trying to establish

00:38:31.550 --> 00:38:37.010
in terms of their
ethics and their morals.

00:38:37.010 --> 00:38:40.000
Because if they're not ethical--

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:41.870
and people discover
that-- then it

00:38:41.870 --> 00:38:44.480
becomes like a wildfire
on the internet

00:38:44.480 --> 00:38:48.560
to say like this is the
unscrupulous way in which

00:38:48.560 --> 00:38:49.790
this brand is doing business.

00:38:49.790 --> 00:38:52.370
And that can cause them
to fail a lot faster.

00:38:52.370 --> 00:38:54.149
Can you talk about
that a little bit?

00:38:54.149 --> 00:38:54.940
LUCAS CONLEY: Yeah.

00:38:54.940 --> 00:38:56.480
Actually, Mark can
speak a little bit more

00:38:56.480 --> 00:38:57.860
on the client
side, but I can say

00:38:57.860 --> 00:39:01.460
that, right out of the gate,
we had an assumption when

00:39:01.460 --> 00:39:04.370
we published this book and
started doing the work that we

00:39:04.370 --> 00:39:06.920
were doing that the types of
brands that would approach us

00:39:06.920 --> 00:39:10.772
would be the longstanding
brands, the brands that were

00:39:10.772 --> 00:39:12.230
in trouble of going
out of business

00:39:12.230 --> 00:39:14.780
and wanted to
preserve their legacy.

00:39:14.780 --> 00:39:16.850
What we found is,
actually, the majority

00:39:16.850 --> 00:39:19.100
of the brands that approach
us are the younger brands,

00:39:19.100 --> 00:39:20.810
the newer brands.

00:39:20.810 --> 00:39:24.560
And sometimes brands that
are very popular, they've

00:39:24.560 --> 00:39:27.840
got some great product, but
haven't spent the time to say,

00:39:27.840 --> 00:39:28.700
what are we about?

00:39:28.700 --> 00:39:30.470
Like what do what do we do?

00:39:30.470 --> 00:39:33.350
You can actually share, if you
want to share that tech story.

00:39:33.350 --> 00:39:35.470
That's probably
relevant to this.

00:39:35.470 --> 00:39:37.470
MARK MILLER: At the front
of the first chapter?

00:39:37.470 --> 00:39:38.210
Is that what you're thinking of?

00:39:38.210 --> 00:39:40.250
LUCAS CONLEY: I'm thinking
about the consulting

00:39:40.250 --> 00:39:41.330
prior to the book.

00:39:41.330 --> 00:39:43.538
MARK MILLER: So there's a
company that may or may not

00:39:43.538 --> 00:39:47.990
be in this neck of the woods
that likely works in the tech

00:39:47.990 --> 00:39:50.960
space that came with an
interesting proposition, which

00:39:50.960 --> 00:39:54.890
was they could tell us what
they were building that night,

00:39:54.890 --> 00:39:56.960
but they had a hard time
thinking about what they

00:39:56.960 --> 00:39:58.217
were building in the future.

00:39:58.217 --> 00:40:00.050
And it became particularly
relevant for them

00:40:00.050 --> 00:40:03.230
because as they were looking to
mature as an organization, had

00:40:03.230 --> 00:40:05.660
investors who were asking
hard questions of them, which

00:40:05.660 --> 00:40:08.240
is in a sea of companies
that are popping up overnight

00:40:08.240 --> 00:40:11.870
with interesting things,
was yours worth backing?

00:40:11.870 --> 00:40:13.970
And their honest
assessment of it

00:40:13.970 --> 00:40:17.829
was they did not know how
to answer that question.

00:40:17.829 --> 00:40:19.370
And that became
incredibly important.

00:40:19.370 --> 00:40:21.079
And that's fairly
common, which is

00:40:21.079 --> 00:40:23.370
we see plenty of people who
walk in the agency who say,

00:40:23.370 --> 00:40:24.890
my goal is they're going
to start a company,

00:40:24.890 --> 00:40:27.120
sell it for a billion
dollars as fast as I can,

00:40:27.120 --> 00:40:28.340
and then I'm done.

00:40:28.340 --> 00:40:31.220
And our endeavor
is actually to say,

00:40:31.220 --> 00:40:32.810
our thinking is not
for those people.

00:40:32.810 --> 00:40:34.970
Our thinking is
not for everyone.

00:40:34.970 --> 00:40:36.380
Technology is changing.

00:40:36.380 --> 00:40:37.922
Things are moving
at a fast pace.

00:40:37.922 --> 00:40:39.380
But it's not
permission to not have

00:40:39.380 --> 00:40:41.900
a long-term ambition or a goal.

00:40:41.900 --> 00:40:44.674
So the ones who define their
businesses only by the hardware

00:40:44.674 --> 00:40:47.090
are the ones who are most
likely to be copied and imitated

00:40:47.090 --> 00:40:48.290
quickly at a lower price.

00:40:48.290 --> 00:40:50.190
And the ones who say,
the hardware is simply

00:40:50.190 --> 00:40:52.910
a manifestation of a
larger idea are the ones

00:40:52.910 --> 00:40:55.720
who have an opportunity to last
for a longer period of time.

00:40:55.720 --> 00:40:57.470
The other story that
I'll add very quickly

00:40:57.470 --> 00:40:59.053
is at the start of
our first chapter--

00:40:59.053 --> 00:41:01.820
the start of all our chapters,
we rip stories out of culture.

00:41:01.820 --> 00:41:03.830
So the vast majority of
stories that we covered

00:41:03.830 --> 00:41:05.390
are based on primary
research, but at the front

00:41:05.390 --> 00:41:07.250
of every chapter you
find what was supposed

00:41:07.250 --> 00:41:09.800
to be an iconic leader
that everyone in the world

00:41:09.800 --> 00:41:12.410
would agree is making the
kind of positive change

00:41:12.410 --> 00:41:14.384
that it eases you
into a chapter.

00:41:14.384 --> 00:41:15.800
So right at the
start of chapter 1

00:41:15.800 --> 00:41:17.780
is Mark Zuckerberg
from Facebook.

00:41:17.780 --> 00:41:19.680
And we wrote about
him before, of course,

00:41:19.680 --> 00:41:24.114
the questions came out
about transparency and data.

00:41:24.114 --> 00:41:26.030
And so we've subsequently
been asked questions

00:41:26.030 --> 00:41:28.250
about the degree to which
we stand behind the story.

00:41:28.250 --> 00:41:30.290
And we have the same
answer and we feel strongly

00:41:30.290 --> 00:41:32.810
about it, which is we
didn't write the history

00:41:32.810 --> 00:41:36.164
book on brands that forevermore
are doing exceptional things.

00:41:36.164 --> 00:41:38.330
We covered a moment in time
where leaders and brands

00:41:38.330 --> 00:41:40.774
were doing exemplary work.

00:41:40.774 --> 00:41:42.440
And if they want to
be in the next book,

00:41:42.440 --> 00:41:44.630
they would continue to hold
fast to the values that

00:41:44.630 --> 00:41:45.680
got them there.

00:41:45.680 --> 00:41:47.660
And if they abandon
them, they likely

00:41:47.660 --> 00:41:48.940
wouldn't be in the next book.

00:41:48.940 --> 00:41:51.230
So we actually found it not--

00:41:51.230 --> 00:41:52.970
it was a fascinating
thing, which

00:41:52.970 --> 00:41:55.700
is it forced us and the readers
of the book and the press

00:41:55.700 --> 00:41:58.340
as well to confront the
reality that we weren't talking

00:41:58.340 --> 00:42:01.190
about people who should be
famous for what they once did.

00:42:01.190 --> 00:42:02.720
We're talking about
people who live

00:42:02.720 --> 00:42:04.760
by their words every
single day and helped

00:42:04.760 --> 00:42:06.040
to write history every day.

00:42:09.440 --> 00:42:10.300
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:42:10.300 --> 00:42:11.591
LUCAS CONLEY: Yeah, absolutely.

00:42:14.715 --> 00:42:16.340
AUDIENCE: In a similar
vein, you talked

00:42:16.340 --> 00:42:18.290
about Blockbuster
and RadioShack,

00:42:18.290 --> 00:42:21.795
who their business
model kind of went away.

00:42:21.795 --> 00:42:23.420
But there's a lot of
theories about how

00:42:23.420 --> 00:42:25.370
they could have pivoted
or recontextualized

00:42:25.370 --> 00:42:27.000
to still exist.

00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:29.300
So are they examples of
companies that kind of

00:42:29.300 --> 00:42:30.860
maintained their
legacy and values,

00:42:30.860 --> 00:42:33.627
while having to change what
they did pretty fundamentally?

00:42:33.627 --> 00:42:35.460
LUCAS CONLEY: It's
interesting you say that.

00:42:35.460 --> 00:42:38.210
The story that we also put in
the book at the very beginning

00:42:38.210 --> 00:42:39.280
is Kodak too.

00:42:39.280 --> 00:42:42.230
We kind of bunched those three
together as cautionary tales.

00:42:42.230 --> 00:42:44.660
And I love the Kodak
version as a cautionary tale

00:42:44.660 --> 00:42:46.715
because they actually
invented the digital camera

00:42:46.715 --> 00:42:49.130
back in like 1974.

00:42:49.130 --> 00:42:51.700
And somebody brought
it to an executive

00:42:51.700 --> 00:42:54.320
and the executive said this
would ruin our photo business.

00:42:54.320 --> 00:42:56.750
We have printing
booths everywhere.

00:42:56.750 --> 00:42:58.034
That's all our revenue.

00:42:58.034 --> 00:43:00.200
This is not something that
we want to put out there.

00:43:00.200 --> 00:43:02.570
So they buried the
invention, and ultimately it

00:43:02.570 --> 00:43:04.590
was their demise.

00:43:04.590 --> 00:43:08.390
So it's a fascinating
little case study.

00:43:08.390 --> 00:43:11.150
As far as brands that
have transitioned,

00:43:11.150 --> 00:43:13.430
what I do think
is interesting is

00:43:13.430 --> 00:43:15.779
some of the brands in the
book will come to us and say--

00:43:15.779 --> 00:43:17.320
The Honest Company
is a good example.

00:43:17.320 --> 00:43:19.340
They're right here,
right around the corner.

00:43:19.340 --> 00:43:21.920
They'll tell you we
build these products

00:43:21.920 --> 00:43:24.635
or we sell these
products, but tomorrow we

00:43:24.635 --> 00:43:26.510
could be selling something
entirely different

00:43:26.510 --> 00:43:29.960
because it's the values and
our mission aren't necessarily

00:43:29.960 --> 00:43:31.172
about the products.

00:43:31.172 --> 00:43:32.630
The Honest Company,
for example, is

00:43:32.630 --> 00:43:35.160
about a cleaner, greener world.

00:43:35.160 --> 00:43:37.390
They could be making
clothing next year.

00:43:37.390 --> 00:43:39.590
They would still stay
true to that principle.

00:43:39.590 --> 00:43:42.140
They would just be doing
that in a different industry.

00:43:42.140 --> 00:43:44.690
I've been surprised by how
many times we've heard that.

00:43:44.690 --> 00:43:47.126
But can you think
of examples or--

00:43:47.126 --> 00:43:49.250
MARK MILLER: Ritz-Carlton's
another reasonable one,

00:43:49.250 --> 00:43:51.009
which is in response
to the question,

00:43:51.009 --> 00:43:53.300
in a hundred years from now,
what do you hope persists?

00:43:53.300 --> 00:43:55.258
One of the founding
members was very reflective

00:43:55.258 --> 00:43:57.590
and he said, if the
hotels look the same

00:43:57.590 --> 00:43:59.824
and if people dress
the same, and if people

00:43:59.824 --> 00:44:01.490
act in exactly the
same way, then people

00:44:01.490 --> 00:44:04.190
fundamentally misunderstand
what this brand is all about.

00:44:04.190 --> 00:44:06.400
We're about ladies and
gentlemen treating people

00:44:06.400 --> 00:44:07.400
as ladies and gentlemen.

00:44:07.400 --> 00:44:08.900
We're about
graciousness and manners

00:44:08.900 --> 00:44:10.689
in a world that is
often without them.

00:44:10.689 --> 00:44:12.230
And to a degree,
we're about creating

00:44:12.230 --> 00:44:14.369
memories that last a lifetime.

00:44:14.369 --> 00:44:16.410
So it's not just about a
two or three night stay,

00:44:16.410 --> 00:44:19.940
it's about us a seven
memory stay, for example.

00:44:19.940 --> 00:44:23.810
And his point was we teach
culture and value every day,

00:44:23.810 --> 00:44:25.444
and that's why today
we have hotels,

00:44:25.444 --> 00:44:27.110
and tomorrow we're
going to have yachts,

00:44:27.110 --> 00:44:30.320
and beyond that the Ritz-Carlton
might manifest as something

00:44:30.320 --> 00:44:33.044
fundamentally different than
a conventional hotel company.

00:44:33.044 --> 00:44:34.460
They got an
interesting phone call

00:44:34.460 --> 00:44:38.690
from a documentarian, a group
that was making a documentary.

00:44:38.690 --> 00:44:40.445
And they said, we're
going to cover Airbnb

00:44:40.445 --> 00:44:43.130
and we're going to cover
the Ritz-Carlton as examples

00:44:43.130 --> 00:44:47.180
of iconic, successful
hospitality spaces today.

00:44:47.180 --> 00:44:49.836
And their question
was, which hotels

00:44:49.836 --> 00:44:50.960
do you want us to document?

00:44:50.960 --> 00:44:54.470
And Ritz-Carlton said,
effectively, we don't care.

00:44:54.470 --> 00:44:55.842
And they said, what do you mean?

00:44:55.842 --> 00:44:57.550
Which of the hotels
you want to show off?

00:44:57.550 --> 00:44:59.990
And they said, any of
them and none of them

00:44:59.990 --> 00:45:01.970
because what defines
us are not the walls.

00:45:01.970 --> 00:45:03.050
We'll tell you the
people that we'd

00:45:03.050 --> 00:45:05.050
like you to document
because we think the people

00:45:05.050 --> 00:45:07.790
and the style of service
is the thing that lives on.

00:45:07.790 --> 00:45:10.530
And it took the media
company a while to digest it,

00:45:10.530 --> 00:45:12.030
but when they
understood, they said,

00:45:12.030 --> 00:45:13.580
yeah, I guess that's
what makes you

00:45:13.580 --> 00:45:15.100
and Airbnb
fundamentally different.

00:45:15.100 --> 00:45:17.120
One's about the
spaces you occupy,

00:45:17.120 --> 00:45:19.000
and one's about the
interactions you have,

00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:19.958
no matter where you go.

00:45:19.958 --> 00:45:21.380
And they said,
yes, that's what we

00:45:21.380 --> 00:45:25.100
hope lives for 100 years,
those human interactions.

00:45:25.100 --> 00:45:28.230
So over time, we'll look
to plus those stories.

00:45:28.230 --> 00:45:30.990
But I think Honest
is one in the making.

00:45:30.990 --> 00:45:33.950
I think Ritz is a brand
that's more than 30 years old.

00:45:33.950 --> 00:45:36.050
It's probably not a bad one.

00:45:36.050 --> 00:45:40.250
And it'd be curious to see
what happens with brands

00:45:40.250 --> 00:45:42.624
like Bluebird over time.

00:45:42.624 --> 00:45:43.790
They're a fascinating story.

00:45:43.790 --> 00:45:46.280
They refuse to
knock down the walls

00:45:46.280 --> 00:45:48.740
and make it a venue for
thousands of people.

00:45:48.740 --> 00:45:52.360
They say that if the performers
can't see the audience,

00:45:52.360 --> 00:45:53.515
the experience dies.

00:45:53.515 --> 00:45:54.890
And yet, they're
looking for ways

00:45:54.890 --> 00:45:57.056
to transport that experience
all over the world that

00:45:57.056 --> 00:45:58.817
doesn't violate their
culture and values.

00:45:58.817 --> 00:45:59.900
So it'll be a curious one.

00:46:05.330 --> 00:46:08.640
AUDIENCE: Question about
legacy when it comes to--

00:46:08.640 --> 00:46:10.850
industry is making
significant shifts.

00:46:10.850 --> 00:46:12.500
So like you guys
are from Team One.

00:46:12.500 --> 00:46:14.150
Automotive industry
is working to be

00:46:14.150 --> 00:46:17.000
like more mobility-focused
instead of selling cars.

00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:20.590
And like that's a
hard right, right?

00:46:20.590 --> 00:46:22.830
That's not like, oh,
let's think about this.

00:46:22.830 --> 00:46:25.410
They're trying to do
it really quickly.

00:46:25.410 --> 00:46:27.050
What's your guys'
take on legacy when

00:46:27.050 --> 00:46:29.960
there's companies that are
trying to take on things that

00:46:29.960 --> 00:46:31.970
might be outside of their zone?

00:46:35.061 --> 00:46:37.310
MARK MILLER: I can speak to
automotive directly, which

00:46:37.310 --> 00:46:42.350
is that world is changing so
dramatically that I believe

00:46:42.350 --> 00:46:43.790
if you sat down
with Akio Toyoda,

00:46:43.790 --> 00:46:47.720
he would tell you mobility
isn't a made up idea.

00:46:47.720 --> 00:46:50.310
That he would say mobility
was always a part of the DNA.

00:46:50.310 --> 00:46:52.940
Maybe it was not at
the top of the pyramid.

00:46:52.940 --> 00:46:54.984
Maybe it wasn't always
discussed and revealed.

00:46:54.984 --> 00:46:56.900
But he would tell you
the way they move people

00:46:56.900 --> 00:46:58.640
through the world, including
how they move people

00:46:58.640 --> 00:47:00.389
through a dealership,
how they move people

00:47:00.389 --> 00:47:03.320
through an online experience,
how they move people from home

00:47:03.320 --> 00:47:05.254
to work and beyond,
he would tell you

00:47:05.254 --> 00:47:06.920
it's a part of the
truth of the company.

00:47:06.920 --> 00:47:09.378
One of the supporters of our
book that we're quite proud of

00:47:09.378 --> 00:47:10.500
is Simon Sinek.

00:47:10.500 --> 00:47:12.895
And when Simon got involved
he was skeptical at first.

00:47:12.895 --> 00:47:15.020
He said, I'm sure you're
talking to a lot of people

00:47:15.020 --> 00:47:17.210
who are telling you fairy tales
and fantasies about what they

00:47:17.210 --> 00:47:19.340
wish they would become,
but don't represent

00:47:19.340 --> 00:47:20.540
the truth of what they are.

00:47:20.540 --> 00:47:22.289
And once we started
dissecting the stories

00:47:22.289 --> 00:47:26.570
and going through them, he
became a fan, particularly

00:47:26.570 --> 00:47:28.820
of the Fast Company's story.

00:47:28.820 --> 00:47:31.100
And I think he particularly
liked the Taylor story.

00:47:31.100 --> 00:47:33.650
But he really challenged
us, as you're appropriately

00:47:33.650 --> 00:47:36.020
doing, which is to
say, are you guys

00:47:36.020 --> 00:47:39.100
just showing the shiniest pieces
that companies want you to see?

00:47:39.100 --> 00:47:41.730
Or are these real
elements of the brand?

00:47:41.730 --> 00:47:43.160
So for automotive,
specifically, I

00:47:43.160 --> 00:47:46.850
think Toyota has some truth
in the notion of mobility.

00:47:46.850 --> 00:47:48.980
And what they look
like tomorrow better

00:47:48.980 --> 00:47:52.190
be fundamentally different
than today because otherwise

00:47:52.190 --> 00:47:53.450
they'll be dead and gone.

00:47:53.450 --> 00:47:54.640
AUDIENCE: Yeah, totally.

00:47:54.640 --> 00:47:57.015
I look at Mark Fields and what
they were doing with Ford,

00:47:57.015 --> 00:47:59.672
and it's like the Ford
past totally tanked, right?

00:47:59.672 --> 00:48:01.880
It's like how are you going
to do this the right way?

00:48:01.880 --> 00:48:04.810
And it's a big change.

00:48:04.810 --> 00:48:07.115
So you're right about
the DNA of Toyota always

00:48:07.115 --> 00:48:09.320
being about mobility,
but it's like how do you

00:48:09.320 --> 00:48:12.030
do it the right way and how do
you buy yourself enough time?

00:48:12.030 --> 00:48:13.959
Which is another
key piece of it.

00:48:13.959 --> 00:48:15.500
When you were talking
about switching

00:48:15.500 --> 00:48:17.370
from going from selling
cars or whatever

00:48:17.370 --> 00:48:19.940
it may be to whatever shift
you're doing as a company,

00:48:19.940 --> 00:48:22.562
how much of a period of
time do you need to change--

00:48:22.562 --> 00:48:24.020
even if it is part
of your legacy--

00:48:24.020 --> 00:48:26.360
change the dynamics
of your business?

00:48:26.360 --> 00:48:27.107
I'll shut up now.

00:48:27.107 --> 00:48:29.690
MARK MILLER: We write a piece
in the book-- right at the end--

00:48:29.690 --> 00:48:32.420
that talks about the
old measurement system

00:48:32.420 --> 00:48:34.850
was a simple evaluation
of assets and liabilities.

00:48:34.850 --> 00:48:37.820
So in a quarter, in a year, what
are the things that hold value?

00:48:37.820 --> 00:48:39.630
What are the things
that are losing value?

00:48:39.630 --> 00:48:42.920
And we worked with a semiotician
in London and built a model,

00:48:42.920 --> 00:48:45.072
which is concurrently
looking at latent value--

00:48:45.072 --> 00:48:46.530
those things that
still have value,

00:48:46.530 --> 00:48:48.785
but if you don't evolve
it, it becomes useless--

00:48:48.785 --> 00:48:50.410
and concurrently,
looking at the things

00:48:50.410 --> 00:48:51.530
that you change in real time.

00:48:51.530 --> 00:48:53.300
Because if you're not looking
ahead and creating things that

00:48:53.300 --> 00:48:54.920
don't exist, you're
going to find out

00:48:54.920 --> 00:48:58.160
that your Lexus is
unseated by Tesla,

00:48:58.160 --> 00:49:00.980
and Blockbuster's unseated
by Netflix because they never

00:49:00.980 --> 00:49:03.050
bother to pay attention,
and Ritz-Carlton

00:49:03.050 --> 00:49:05.060
could be unseated by
Airbnb because they were

00:49:05.060 --> 00:49:06.830
late to the timeshare game.

00:49:06.830 --> 00:49:09.650
So we do think it's
a fundamental shift.

00:49:09.650 --> 00:49:14.030
On the one hand, the idea
that repeat the past.

00:49:14.030 --> 00:49:16.130
If I just do that, I can't fail.

00:49:16.130 --> 00:49:17.450
Many understand that.

00:49:17.450 --> 00:49:19.100
Even if it fails,
who could say that I

00:49:19.100 --> 00:49:20.990
was wrong for doing
what once worked?

00:49:20.990 --> 00:49:24.080
Equally, we see the ones
who say, screw the past.

00:49:24.080 --> 00:49:25.490
The past was in the past.

00:49:25.490 --> 00:49:28.320
I'm here for my three year
tenure as a CMO or CEO.

00:49:28.320 --> 00:49:29.320
It's a whole new future.

00:49:29.320 --> 00:49:31.880
I'm going to make my mark,
build my resume, and move on.

00:49:31.880 --> 00:49:34.100
The hardest thing is to
actually reconcile the two.

00:49:34.100 --> 00:49:36.440
What are the pieces of the
past worth hanging on to?

00:49:36.440 --> 00:49:38.106
And what are those
elements of modernity

00:49:38.106 --> 00:49:40.350
that we better add or
we're going to fail?

00:49:40.350 --> 00:49:44.450
So I think we have good examples
of brands in the making.

00:49:44.450 --> 00:49:47.827
And I think this is going to
be a constant work in progress.

00:49:47.827 --> 00:49:48.619
LUCAS CONLEY: Yeah.

00:49:48.619 --> 00:49:49.576
MARK MILLER: Thank you.

00:49:49.576 --> 00:49:50.870
AUDIENCE: Appreciate your time.

00:49:50.870 --> 00:49:53.620
