TIM ANDERSON: Hi, and welcome
to Tech Tips from Teachers.

00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:06.450
This episode will focus on
programming and coding apps.

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.830
Our guest today is Sam Patterson
from Palo Alto, California.

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:12.640
Sam holds an educational
doctorate in literacy,

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:15.330
and is currently an elementary
school technology integration

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:16.420
specialist.

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:18.460
Prior to that, he
spent 11 years teaching

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:22.340
middle and high school, and is
also an educational blogger.

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:24.670
Sam, what sort of impact
have you seen technology

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:26.336
have on the classroom?

00:00:26.336 --> 00:00:27.710
SAM PATTERSON: In
my career, I've

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:30.680
seen technology have a
truly democratic impact.

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:32.659
At the beginning,
I was the only one

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:34.624
who could bring content
into my classroom.

00:00:34.624 --> 00:00:37.040
So no matter how much I wanted
my students to have choice,

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:38.567
I always had control.

00:00:38.567 --> 00:00:41.150
Now my students can choose what
content they're learning about

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:42.692
and bring it in on
their own devices.

00:00:42.692 --> 00:00:44.816
TIM ANDERSON: And then with
coding and programming,

00:00:44.816 --> 00:00:47.784
those are two words that we're
hearing more and more and more.

00:00:47.784 --> 00:00:49.950
What sort of impact have
you seen that content have,

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.740
and what should we expect in
the next five or 10 years?

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:53.550
SAM PATTERSON: I
think we're just

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:54.890
at the beginning of
what we're going to see.

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:57.410
We're going to see a lot more
content integration, where

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:00.120
students are going to be not
programming for programming's

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.220
sake, but programming about
what they're learning.

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:05.010
I have students now
who are using Scratch

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.730
to model the
behavior of molecules

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:09.310
in different states of matter.

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:10.490
It's amazing.

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:11.350
TIM ANDERSON: We've
heard from teachers

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:13.440
that there are few important
elements for coding

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:15.280
and programming apps.

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.220
It's crucial for these apps to
have opportunities for students

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:21.130
to apply the content that's
been presented to them,

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:23.740
it's important that there are
engaging incentives, and also

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:26.130
an opportunity for
students and users

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.850
to interact with a
larger community.

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:30.630
Sam, why is it so
important there

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.370
are opportunities for
application within these apps?

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:35.820
SAM PATTERSON: We want
coding apps to give students

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.500
the opportunity to
turn on the camera

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.250
and take a picture of
the learning they're

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:41.550
doing in class, and
bring that into the app,

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:43.899
so that they can
then use the app

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:45.940
to show what they understand
about that knowledge

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:47.774
and build more of an
understanding about it.

00:01:47.774 --> 00:01:49.231
TIM ANDERSON: You've
got experience

00:01:49.231 --> 00:01:50.890
with students of all ages.

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:52.559
Why are incentives so important?

00:01:52.559 --> 00:01:54.350
SAM PATTERSON: Because
we want the students

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:57.710
to be able to be motivated
to work independently

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:59.770
through the challenges
in the programs.

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:02.103
Because all of these do have
challenges built into them.

00:02:02.103 --> 00:02:02.850
TIM ANDERSON: Got it.

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.125
And then what about
that community piece?

00:02:04.125 --> 00:02:05.370
Why is that important?

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:07.060
SAM PATTERSON: It's
huge, because when

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.330
the student publishes
their work to a community

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.370
and other students
can interact with it,

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:12.960
they really are
publishing their work.

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.674
In the classic
model of assessment,

00:02:14.674 --> 00:02:16.590
that publication-- sharing
it with the world--

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.812
is kind of the highest
level of the work we do.

00:02:18.812 --> 00:02:19.770
They've created a text.

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:21.270
They've sent it
out into the world.

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:22.941
And it's really
motivating for students

00:02:22.941 --> 00:02:25.190
when they realize other
people are playing their game,

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:27.142
watching their presentation.

00:02:27.142 --> 00:02:29.350
TIM ANDERSON: Let's take a
look at some exemplar apps

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:31.140
for coding and programming.

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.902
First one, what makes
Tynker for School so great?

00:02:33.902 --> 00:02:35.610
SAM PATTERSON: I love
Tynker for Schools,

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:37.840
because they have
deep resources.

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.330
I can tell my students, if
you don't know the answer,

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:41.670
read the screen and find it.

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:44.080
And they can find either
the directions or the tab

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.890
for help that brings
them those directions.

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:48.660
This is important
because teachers

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.530
can't be the ones holding all
the knowledge about coding.

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:53.430
The application needs
to give students

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.842
the guidance and assistance
they need, when they need it.

00:02:55.842 --> 00:02:58.300
TIM ANDERSON: And what do you
like about The Foos Free Code

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:59.060
Hour.

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:01.200
SAM PATTERSON: The
Foos is very engaging.

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.110
My students would spend all
day there if they could.

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:06.350
And it's engaging
because it's playful,

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:08.880
there's really good incentives,
and at the same time,

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:11.120
they do a good roll out
of different abilities.

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:12.570
And then at the
end, students are

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:15.180
able to choose what they want
to do with their abilities.

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.750
So if they want to create
an infinite number of boxes,

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:18.600
they can.

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.266
TIM ANDERSON: And
then with Pocket Code,

00:03:20.266 --> 00:03:22.796
what makes that such a
great app for classroom use?

00:03:22.796 --> 00:03:24.170
SAM PATTERSON:
Pocket Code allows

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:27.470
students to program something
on their Android tablet,

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:29.220
and then publish
it to a community.

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:31.680
And other people--
students and non-students--

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.830
will be able to
interact with that code.

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:36.600
And that gives
students a real sense

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:39.050
of having created an
actual text that's

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:40.429
going out into the world.

00:03:40.429 --> 00:03:42.220
TIM ANDERSON: So to
recap, a few key things

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:44.030
to keep in mind
when developing apps

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:45.800
for coding and programming.

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:47.790
It's crucial for students
to have opportunities

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:49.440
to apply what they've learned.

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:52.660
It's important for apps to
have engaging incentives.

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:54.345
And it's important
for users to be

00:03:54.345 --> 00:03:56.800
able to interact with
a larger community.

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:58.980
