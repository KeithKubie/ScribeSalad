00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:02.040
- [Lecturer] What we're gonna
talk about in this video

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.028
is how political and cultural events

00:00:06.028 --> 00:00:11.028
might have an influence on
someone's political ideology.

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.510
So let's make this a little bit concrete

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:16.330
and political scientists
will sometimes have

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:19.990
various classifications
for these types of effects.

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:23.710
So for example, there is
something known as generational

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:27.300
effects, and these would
be events that affect an

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.480
entire generation, that
could influence how an entire

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.600
generation thinks about their
position on different issues.

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.850
An example of that might
be if you were to grow up

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:39.890
or if you were an adult
during the Great Depression

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:43.060
in the 1930s, well that might
affect you in many, many

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:43.893
different ways.

00:00:43.893 --> 00:00:45.890
You would start to maybe be
a little bit conservative

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:48.690
with your own personal finances
realizing that a rainy day

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.080
might come one day.

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:52.390
Many people who grew up
during the Great Depression

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:55.820
viewed FDR, Franklin
Roosevelt, as a major factor

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:57.820
in taking the country out
of the Great Depression.

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:00.190
Other folks might disagree
with that position.

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:03.600
But if you were one of those
folks who believed that FDR

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.960
through the expansion of
government helped bring

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.190
the country out of the Great
Depression, and if you believe

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:11.730
that FDR was a good leader
for the United States

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:15.730
during World War Two, well
then, you might lean Democrat.

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:20.170
You might lean Democrat
the rest of your life.

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:22.560
And it indeed seems to be
the case that many people

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.690
who grew during the Great
Depression did indeed

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:28.460
lean Democrat because
of their belief that FDR

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:30.180
was good for the country.

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.000
Similarly, if you grew
up during the Cold War

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.774
or if you were an adult during
the Cold War you had this

00:01:35.774 --> 00:01:39.240
thing hanging over you
in the 60s, 70s, and 80s

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.480
of what would a nuclear war
with the Soviet Union look like?

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:46.190
And so many of those folks
might look at someone

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:49.830
like a Ronald Reagan, who
many people would argue

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:52.240
helped bring about the
end of the Cold War.

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.100
And so many of these folks
who did view Ronald Reagan

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.753
as a major actor there
might lean Republican.

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:02.160
Or even if they don't lean Republican

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:05.030
they might say, hey, the
type of strong muscular

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:09.180
military presence with
diplomacy that Ronald Reagan did

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:12.480
well, that's a type of point
of view that I support.

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.970
Now these two things were
big, macro events that would

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:19.580
have happened over many,
many years, if not decades.

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.500
But there could also be particular events

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.660
and sometimes particular political events

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:26.710
that might influence
someone's political ideology.

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:29.297
So let me write this
down, political events.

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:37.000
And so an example of that
might be the Watergate Scandal

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.560
under Richard Nixon.

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:41.150
Many of the people who were
adults then and understood

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:43.970
what was going on, it
might have led to a general

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:46.110
distrust in government.

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:49.900
It might have led to a more
of a belief that people

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.770
in high office do things
without telling us.

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:55.460
Once again, these are not,
it's not gonna be everyone

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:58.070
who lived in that time
period, but it might make some

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:00.540
folks lean one direction or another.

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.560
Now everything I've talked
about has been in the realm

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.190
of politics, but there is
also a lot that happens

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.900
in culture that could
affect your ideology.

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:11.170
If you see more of a certain
point of view on television

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:14.211
for example or in movies,
that might make you more

00:03:14.211 --> 00:03:17.010
sympathetic to that point of view.

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:20.670
You also have effects over
the course of your life

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:22.160
that affect your ideology.

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:25.990
And so these are often
known as lifecycle effects.

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:27.523
Lifecycle effects.

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:33.680
And this is the idea that
as you go from being young

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:37.470
to getting older, just
different things in your life

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:39.637
might make you lean in
one direction or another.

00:03:39.637 --> 00:03:41.653
And these are going to
be broad generalizations

00:03:41.653 --> 00:03:44.930
but let's say you are
young, you are in college,

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:47.764
you have a lot of student
debt, you might lean

00:03:47.764 --> 00:03:51.356
maybe toward a more progressive
candidate or have liberal

00:03:51.356 --> 00:03:54.180
leanings if a candidate
says hey, the government's

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:56.800
going to try to reduce
student debt or provide more

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:58.860
support for young students.

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:01.860
But then as you get older and
maybe you become a homeowner

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:04.870
maybe you have more wealth,
you have a higher income,

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:07.540
you might say, hey, these
taxes really hurt more

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:09.810
than I suspected and they're
quite large, or maybe you're

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:12.244
starting a business or you're
saying, hey, these regulations

00:04:12.244 --> 00:04:15.200
really aren't as good as an
idea as I thought they were

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:18.140
when I was young, well then
maybe you might, and I'd

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:21.940
stress might, you might start
leaning more conservative.

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:23.180
So I'll leave you there.

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:25.910
The big picture is is that
your political ideology

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:30.910
isn't just driven by your
genetics or your family

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:32.670
and we've talked about
these in other videos,

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:34.850
or where you grew up.

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:38.855
So not just driven by geography,
it's driven by a whole

00:04:38.855 --> 00:04:41.860
set of things, many of the
things that might happen

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:45.730
to you individually, let's
say you had a bad incident

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:49.500
with crime that might
make you tougher on crime.

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:52.170
Or maybe you were on the
other side, you got arrested

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:54.100
for something you didn't
do, that might change your

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:58.340
point of view, and things
that happen on a bigger scale,

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:00.890
things that might happen
to your entire generation.
