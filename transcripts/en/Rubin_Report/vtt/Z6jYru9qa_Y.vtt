1
00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:05.330
[inaudible] joining me today is a leader,

2
00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:11.160
a follower,
a reader,
or a writer,
a speaker or a listener.
A student,
a teacher,

3
00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:14.940
Jocko Willink.
Welcome to the Rubin report.
How was that?

4
00:00:14.941 --> 00:00:17.130
I took that right out of the bio.
That's good.

5
00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.840
Right out of the Twitter bio as much viral.
Yeah.
Yeah.

6
00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:21.600
You're a little bit of everything.

7
00:00:21.601 --> 00:00:24.630
That actually is a pretty good explanation of you.
It actually,

8
00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:26.610
it actually is a pretty good explanation to me.

9
00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:31.650
I think garden cover those multiple dichotomies fairly well.
Yeah,

10
00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:35.760
that would probably explain why you've written roughly 37,000 books.

11
00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:37.130
How many books have you written?
I mean,

12
00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.200
I normally only put one book on the table.
We put four here.

13
00:00:40.201 --> 00:00:44.340
I've written so far I've written three adult books and three kids books.

14
00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.150
I've got another kid's book coming out in the Spring and I've got another adult

15
00:00:48.151 --> 00:00:48.990
book coming out,

16
00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:54.180
going head to head with Jordan Peterson in January of 2020 Oh,

17
00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:58.620
oh yeah.
I probably will be on tour with him for that book.

18
00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.790
That means that we're going to be in competition.
Okay,
well bring it all right.

19
00:01:02.791 --> 00:01:06.960
We'll see.
We'll see.
Okay,
so nice to,
uh,
to not actually have to compete with,

20
00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.700
with y'all.
Yeah.
What do you,

21
00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:10.570
do you feel like you're in competition with anyone that's,

22
00:01:10.571 --> 00:01:13.020
that's an interesting place to start off.
Well that's,

23
00:01:13.021 --> 00:01:15.300
I guess there's a dichotomy there too because I don't feel like I'm in

24
00:01:15.301 --> 00:01:18.030
competition with anyone and I feel like I'm competent.

25
00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:22.620
I'm trying to touch just sort of in my nature to just compete.

26
00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.790
But no,
I mean in this world that I'm in right now,

27
00:01:26.791 --> 00:01:28.350
I don't really feel like I'm competing with anyone.

28
00:01:28.351 --> 00:01:30.750
I feel like I'm just kind of doing what I do,

29
00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:32.730
talking about what I like to talk about,

30
00:01:32.731 --> 00:01:37.200
writing about what I like to write about and hanging out with cool people most

31
00:01:37.201 --> 00:01:39.360
of the time.
Yeah.
Pretty good.
Pretty good.
All right.

32
00:01:39.361 --> 00:01:43.380
Well I think 99% of my audience knows who you are and knows a lot about you.

33
00:01:43.381 --> 00:01:45.540
But for the people that don't,
and by the way,
I should say,

34
00:01:45.541 --> 00:01:46.201
right before we started,

35
00:01:46.201 --> 00:01:50.250
I was saying we have been trying to coordinate this for about 27 years.

36
00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:54.120
Right?
I mean a long time,
which is kind of funny.
I mean,
it really says,
it's like,

37
00:01:54.121 --> 00:01:57.000
well,
we're two people that are,
that are busy.
Yeah.
And it was hard to,

38
00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.030
hard to really make this happen,
but for the people that know nothing about you,

39
00:02:00.031 --> 00:02:04.170
tell me a little bit about your history.
I was born and raised in a small,

40
00:02:04.171 --> 00:02:08.310
New England town.
I was a rebellious kid.
My

41
00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:13.530
best way to rebel as a kid coming from a small new England town was to join the

42
00:02:13.531 --> 00:02:16.350
military.
So I joined the military after high school.

43
00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:21.480
I spent 20 years in the military and when I retired from the military,

44
00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:26.630
I started taking the things that I learned from the military and teaching them

45
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.660
to civilian companies and civilian leaders.

46
00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.890
And eventually that turned into a book and a podcast and all this other stuff.

47
00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.490
Yeah.

48
00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:38.190
So tell me a little bit more about what you were like that made you want to go

49
00:02:38.191 --> 00:02:42.810
into the military.
What was that rebellious kid or whatever that was?
Yeah.

50
00:02:42.811 --> 00:02:43.081
You know,

51
00:02:43.081 --> 00:02:48.081
I just grew up in a little new England town and there was a lot of hippies and

52
00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:53.550
just kind of kids like that running around and smoking pot and whatever.

53
00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:57.540
And I really wasn't into that.
And so,
you know,

54
00:02:57.541 --> 00:03:00.490
I got to think a lot of kids when they rebel as kids because all kids rebel,

55
00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:04.300
a lot of kids repelled by drinking or they do drugs or whatever they're gonna
do.

56
00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:09.420
And I went in the other direction was like into hardcore music and eventually

57
00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.860
said,
Oh yeah,

58
00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:16.030
I'm just going to join the military because that's what I'm going to do.
Yeah,

59
00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:20.320
it's funny when you talk about it and it almost sounds like you're slightly

60
00:03:20.321 --> 00:03:24.400
dismissing it,
but you had a pretty good storied career as a navy seal.

61
00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:28.840
Yeah,
no,
I grew up in the seal teams.
I went right in the navy,

62
00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:32.560
right in the seal teams and that's where I spent my whole adult life.

63
00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:35.290
And it was an incredible experience.

64
00:03:35.291 --> 00:03:39.730
Worked with a bunch of awesome people and got to do things that I had dreamed

65
00:03:39.731 --> 00:03:41.380
about doing since I was a little kid.
Well,

66
00:03:41.381 --> 00:03:45.040
what should we know about like the life of a navy seal that you don't get in the

67
00:03:45.041 --> 00:03:48.880
movies or,
or however else we just sort of imagined these lives to be.

68
00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:53.560
I would say the biggest thing to remember is that that people in the seal teams

69
00:03:53.561 --> 00:03:56.800
and people in the military in general,
they're people,
they're just normal people.

70
00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:58.960
They go home,
they got wives,
they got kids,

71
00:03:58.961 --> 00:04:02.680
they're trying to live a normal life and then their job requires them to do

72
00:04:02.681 --> 00:04:06.310
things that are very normal.
And so they,
you know,
for me,

73
00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:10.630
I kind of learned to compartmentalize what I was doing in the military and when

74
00:04:10.631 --> 00:04:12.020
I'd come home,
and I always,

75
00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:15.970
I tell this to police officers and firefighters and military guys today don't,

76
00:04:15.971 --> 00:04:19.090
when you get home,
don't bring your uniform home.
Don't wear your uniform home.

77
00:04:19.091 --> 00:04:23.020
Like physically change your,
take your uniform off,
leave it at work,
put on your,

78
00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:26.390
your civilian clothes when you go home and be a civilian.
The,

79
00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:30.160
how hard is that though,
once you're sort of in that locked mindset,

80
00:04:30.161 --> 00:04:33.280
which obviously has so much to do with the things that you write about and why

81
00:04:33.281 --> 00:04:37.690
your message actually is working and helping people.
You say,

82
00:04:37.691 --> 00:04:40.890
how hard is it l it can be hard,
it can be hard.
Uh,
you know,

83
00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:45.990
cause you've got one life that you're living where decisions are really

84
00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:51.360
consequential and then you've got your regular life that you're living and

85
00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:55.270
things aren't that they aren't as consequential.
You know,

86
00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:59.830
I had a situation where I was at work and there was a lot of stuff going on at

87
00:04:59.831 --> 00:05:03.460
work.
They were,
they were redeploying people to Afghanistan.

88
00:05:03.461 --> 00:05:05.440
There was big decisions that were being made at work.

89
00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:09.460
And I remember I came home from work one day and like I said,

90
00:05:09.461 --> 00:05:11.770
tried to try to leave my work at work.

91
00:05:11.771 --> 00:05:16.000
But I'm sitting there thinking about how all this stuff is going to unfold and

92
00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:20.020
my wife,
you know,
I got home and my wife cause I can't believe this.

93
00:05:20.021 --> 00:05:24.850
And I was like,
what happened is,
is everything okay?
And she says,
you know,

94
00:05:24.851 --> 00:05:29.050
the,
no,
it's not okay.
The Disney on ice is the same night.

95
00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:33.790
Some other events for the kids.
And I'm just thinking,
Hey,
if that's,

96
00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:37.570
if that's the biggest worries my wife has,
then that's a positive thing,

97
00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:40.330
then life's pretty good.
Yeah.
Life's pretty good.
Yeah.

98
00:05:40.331 --> 00:05:44.260
So how quickly did you realize that you wanted to sort of bring these ideas

99
00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:49.470
about personal responsibility and sort of owning your life and all that into

100
00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:55.090
sort of that world,
the world where Disney on ice matters?
Yeah,
it's,

101
00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:58.430
I was about six months from retiring.

102
00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:02.030
I had a friend that was the CEO of a big company and he said,

103
00:06:02.031 --> 00:06:05.930
I want you to come and talk to my executives about combat leadership.
And I said,

104
00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:09.860
hey,
sure.
You know,
sounds,
sounds cool.
So I went and did it and when I got,

105
00:06:09.861 --> 00:06:12.470
and I don't think he really knew what to expect,
you know,

106
00:06:12.471 --> 00:06:15.950
because I'm looking like a knuckle dragger and I'm at least a good portion.

107
00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:20.840
I actually am a knuckle dragger and so we bring me in to talk and I thought,

108
00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:24.260
I think he was maybe thinking,
I tell some cold war stories and that'd be,

109
00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:27.410
that'd be great.
But I actually started talking about how you lead.

110
00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:29.570
And when I got done,
he came up to me and said,

111
00:06:29.571 --> 00:06:33.590
I want you to do this for every division that I have in my company.
And I said,

112
00:06:33.591 --> 00:06:37.430
well,
you know,
I'm retiring.
And he said,
well,
I'll give you money.

113
00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:39.860
And I said,
okay.

114
00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:45.110
So I started working with all the different divisionals and at one of those

115
00:06:45.111 --> 00:06:49.310
division meetings,
the CEO of the parent company was there.
And when I got done,

116
00:06:49.311 --> 00:06:50.001
he came up to me and said,

117
00:06:50.001 --> 00:06:52.800
I want you to come and talk to all my CEOs for all these companies that I own.

118
00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:56.480
And he owned like 45 or 50 companies.
So I went and did that.

119
00:06:57.290 --> 00:06:59.060
And when I went and talked to those companies,
of course,

120
00:06:59.061 --> 00:07:00.620
then a bunch of those CEOs came up to me and said,
hey,

121
00:07:00.621 --> 00:07:02.680
I want you to come and talk to my company.
So that's kind of the,

122
00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:05.580
the way that it started and it didn't take me very long at all.
I mean,

123
00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:07.010
it actually was the very first company,

124
00:07:07.011 --> 00:07:08.930
that first guy that I talked to when they started,

125
00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:11.630
when that group started telling me about the problems they were having,

126
00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:13.520
I was sitting there thinking myself,
well,

127
00:07:13.521 --> 00:07:16.120
I solve these problems in seal platoons when I was training seal platoons.

128
00:07:16.130 --> 00:07:17.930
This is the same thing.
It's leadership.
Yeah.

129
00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:21.920
Were you surprised that the big successful businesses were having such a

130
00:07:21.921 --> 00:07:22.970
leadership crisis?

131
00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.060
I was surprised for about five minutes and then I realized that these are all

132
00:07:26.061 --> 00:07:29.660
human beings.
These are the same human beings that are in a seal platoon,

133
00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:33.590
in an RV company and in a business and they're all,

134
00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:38.200
they all have the same idiosyncrasies.
They have the same egos,

135
00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:39.530
the same personalities.

136
00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:42.560
You can see it all and when you've seen it all over and over again,

137
00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:46.280
it becomes pretty evident,
pretty clear when you're looking at it.

138
00:07:46.281 --> 00:07:48.290
And the last job that I had in the seal teams,
I was training,

139
00:07:49.130 --> 00:07:50.870
I was running the seal training for the west coast seal teams.

140
00:07:50.871 --> 00:07:53.360
And this isn't a training where you see like the guys carrying the boats on

141
00:07:53.361 --> 00:07:55.880
their heads and carrying logs around and doing a bunch of pushups and stuff.

142
00:07:56.060 --> 00:08:00.170
The training that I ran was the training where seals actually learned to go into

143
00:08:00.171 --> 00:08:05.171
combat and fight the enemy and this is where we really start focusing on combat

144
00:08:05.391 --> 00:08:08.360
leadership.
And so in this training that I ran,

145
00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:13.310
we got to take seal platoons and put them through really tough training

146
00:08:13.311 --> 00:08:16.610
scenarios,
very realistic training scenarios over and over and over again.

147
00:08:16.610 --> 00:08:21.350
So every night I basically would be putting a new seal platoon through another

148
00:08:21.351 --> 00:08:22.184
training scenario,

149
00:08:22.310 --> 00:08:25.490
which the next night it will be another scope and going through this same

150
00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:26.330
training scenario.

151
00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:28.490
And then the next thing would be another seal between going through the same

152
00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:28.991
training snow.

153
00:08:28.991 --> 00:08:32.390
So you take these different seasons and what's different about a seal platoon?

154
00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:35.330
What's different about a seal platoon is really just boils down to the

155
00:08:35.331 --> 00:08:39.440
leadership because we've got 16 seals in a scope that the guys are basically the

156
00:08:39.441 --> 00:08:42.910
same show.
There's some,
there's a bell curve,
there's some top end performers,

157
00:08:42.911 --> 00:08:44.990
there's some low on performers as a bunch of guys in the middle.

158
00:08:45.230 --> 00:08:48.920
So the real variation on their performance was based almost a hundred percent on

159
00:08:48.921 --> 00:08:52.520
their,
on their leadership.
In fact,
it was 100% on their leadership.

160
00:08:52.940 --> 00:08:57.210
And so I got to see this and I got to watch these leadership scenarios on fold

161
00:08:57.240 --> 00:09:00.450
over and over again and see what leadership things worked and what didn't work.

162
00:09:00.450 --> 00:09:04.920
And,
and so by the time I,
I left that job and entered the civilian sector,

163
00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:09.980
I've watched some random team of leaders inside of an organization and I said to

164
00:09:10.441 --> 00:09:10.851
myself,
well,

165
00:09:10.851 --> 00:09:13.170
they're strategic messages and getting down to the front line troops,

166
00:09:13.230 --> 00:09:15.150
they need to communicate this better.
Or Oh,

167
00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:16.710
they're departments aren't working together.

168
00:09:16.711 --> 00:09:17.940
They need to cover and move forward together.

169
00:09:18.030 --> 00:09:21.480
Or their mission is way too complex and that no one has any idea what they're

170
00:09:21.481 --> 00:09:24.950
actually supposed to be doing.
So they need to simplify this or that.

171
00:09:24.970 --> 00:09:28.350
This senior leader is making all the decisions and therefore everything's moving

172
00:09:28.351 --> 00:09:31.020
really slow and nothing's happening at a good rate of speed.

173
00:09:31.021 --> 00:09:32.770
So they need to use decentralized sematic.

174
00:09:32.970 --> 00:09:35.040
And it was just so obvious when I started.

175
00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:39.090
How much of leadership in general do you think is innate versus learned?

176
00:09:39.091 --> 00:09:41.280
Obviously you're teaching people to learn part,

177
00:09:41.310 --> 00:09:44.880
but there has to be some element that's an eight,
right?
Yeah,
there absolutely is.

178
00:09:44.910 --> 00:09:47.980
And there's the,

179
00:09:48.050 --> 00:09:52.470
the analogy that I give,
and I don't play video games,
but I've seen it,

180
00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:54.240
but on video games,
there's,

181
00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:56.880
you have a character in a video game and you'll have a certain level of

182
00:09:56.881 --> 00:09:59.910
intelligence is on a certain level of strength and a certain level of agility

183
00:10:00.390 --> 00:10:04.170
and those levels are what you get and then you work with them.
Well,

184
00:10:04.171 --> 00:10:06.030
it's the same thing for a leader and there's different,

185
00:10:06.810 --> 00:10:09.870
there's different characteristics that you get that are good for leadership,

186
00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:12.150
right?
If you're someone that's really articulate,

187
00:10:12.151 --> 00:10:15.750
that's a great thing to have to be a good leader because you want the human

188
00:10:15.751 --> 00:10:18.090
beings that you're talking to to understand what you're actually saying.

189
00:10:18.330 --> 00:10:22.230
So and different people are naturally more articulate than other people.

190
00:10:23.010 --> 00:10:27.960
It's good to be able to look at complex problems and be able to simplify them.

191
00:10:27.990 --> 00:10:28.770
Right?
That's a,

192
00:10:28.770 --> 00:10:33.570
that's a very powerful tool to have a really complex thing to solve and be able

193
00:10:33.571 --> 00:10:34.950
to look at it and say,
okay,

194
00:10:35.190 --> 00:10:38.280
simplify it and then simplify it not only for yourself so you can decide what to

195
00:10:38.281 --> 00:10:41.400
do,
but simplify it for your team so they understand what to do.
That's,

196
00:10:41.430 --> 00:10:43.740
that's a characteristic that some people have.

197
00:10:44.110 --> 00:10:47.760
The the one that I bring up a lot because it's very obvious is,

198
00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:52.320
is being loud because if you're in a leadership position,

199
00:10:52.350 --> 00:10:54.630
you need to be able to make people hear you.

200
00:10:54.870 --> 00:10:57.120
And some people are born with a very loud voice.

201
00:10:57.180 --> 00:11:01.990
I was luckily born with a very loud voice and it's inherited from my genes,

202
00:11:02.020 --> 00:11:05.400
right?
And my kids inherited there.
My kids are all can be very loud,

203
00:11:05.401 --> 00:11:07.530
which is sometimes problematic in house,

204
00:11:08.580 --> 00:11:12.240
but if you can't bark a command so that people can hear you and a machine gun

205
00:11:12.241 --> 00:11:14.190
fight,
no one's been able to do what you ask them to do.

206
00:11:14.670 --> 00:11:19.200
So there's these different characteristics and you can improve upon them.

207
00:11:19.201 --> 00:11:21.030
So if you're not very articulate,

208
00:11:21.430 --> 00:11:24.330
you can read and you can write and you can speak and you can become more

209
00:11:24.331 --> 00:11:28.110
articulate.
If you are not very good at simplifying problems,

210
00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:32.610
you can start looking at complex problems and thinking about how you can

211
00:11:32.611 --> 00:11:34.560
simplify them.
And you can get better at that.

212
00:11:35.550 --> 00:11:39.750
The being loud part is that,
there's definitely a genetic aspect of that.

213
00:11:39.751 --> 00:11:42.390
So sure you can learn to project your voice more,

214
00:11:42.420 --> 00:11:44.640
but some people aren't very loud,
they're just born that way.

215
00:11:44.641 --> 00:11:46.770
And so what does a person do in that situation?
Well,

216
00:11:46.830 --> 00:11:49.590
what a person does not situation is when they have to give an order,

217
00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:53.070
they tell one of the loud mouse in their platoon to tell everyone to get over

218
00:11:53.140 --> 00:11:56.880
this other building now.
And that loud mouth will pass the word.

219
00:11:56.880 --> 00:11:58.300
And so what you do as a leader,

220
00:11:58.301 --> 00:12:02.170
as you find members for your team that can compliment your weaknesses.

221
00:12:02.470 --> 00:12:05.590
So there are parts that you could improve and there are parts that you can

222
00:12:05.591 --> 00:12:09.010
improve.
And if you,

223
00:12:09.670 --> 00:12:14.670
the only real impediment to improving is someone that doesn't have the humility

224
00:12:15.490 --> 00:12:16.510
to say,
you know what,

225
00:12:16.870 --> 00:12:19.510
I think I could work on being more articulate or you know what?

226
00:12:19.511 --> 00:12:22.780
I think I could work on solving problems and making them more simple.

227
00:12:22.781 --> 00:12:26.740
Or you know what?
I'm not that loud.
And instead of saying,
you know what,

228
00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:29.530
that's not a good way to lead and said,
I said,
you know what?
I'm not that loud,

229
00:12:29.531 --> 00:12:31.360
but Billy over here is loud,

230
00:12:31.390 --> 00:12:34.210
so I'm going to let him put the word out when it needs to get put out.

231
00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:37.360
But if you're giving out the humility to do that,
you won't improve as a leader.

232
00:12:37.390 --> 00:12:41.730
Have you found those people that even if you lay out what the right,
you know,

233
00:12:41.750 --> 00:12:45.070
skills are that they have to work on or where their blind spots are,
etc. Etc.

234
00:12:45.071 --> 00:12:48.640
That they just can't,
whether it's ego or whatever else that they just can't,

235
00:12:48.641 --> 00:12:51.340
they just,
certain people you just can't get through to.
Absolutely.

236
00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:54.700
It's a horrible situation to be in.
And in the seal teams,

237
00:12:54.730 --> 00:12:58.780
those guys will get fired in the civilian sector.
Generally.

238
00:12:59.230 --> 00:13:02.400
Those guys get fired because I mean you,
you,

239
00:13:02.401 --> 00:13:06.850
you go into a company and you've got a CEO that is not listening to anyone up or

240
00:13:06.851 --> 00:13:09.520
down the chain and not listening to the board,
not listening to subordinates.

241
00:13:09.730 --> 00:13:12.730
How is he going to improve?
He's not going to,
and by the way,

242
00:13:12.731 --> 00:13:13.720
why does he need to improve?

243
00:13:13.930 --> 00:13:16.600
He needs to improve because his company isn't doing well.
So,

244
00:13:16.870 --> 00:13:19.590
but this person might think,
hey,
you know,
I'm great.
I don't,

245
00:13:19.660 --> 00:13:22.810
I'm not gonna learn anything from anybody.
I'm just gonna keep doing it my way.

246
00:13:23.140 --> 00:13:27.580
And that guy's not going to stay in that job because they don't have the

247
00:13:27.581 --> 00:13:30.370
humility to say,
you know what,
I'm probably doing some things wrong.

248
00:13:30.430 --> 00:13:32.200
That's why we're not making money.

249
00:13:32.740 --> 00:13:36.640
And so I need to change some of the things that I'm doing so that we can make

250
00:13:36.641 --> 00:13:40.180
money.
But if you don't have that attitude and you're not humble,
yeah,

251
00:13:40.181 --> 00:13:41.800
you'll end up getting fired.
So conversely,

252
00:13:41.801 --> 00:13:45.730
have you seen people that basically had none of the skills that have been able

253
00:13:45.731 --> 00:13:46.391
to overcome it?

254
00:13:46.391 --> 00:13:50.590
Just through perseverance that just innately don't have the leadership traits

255
00:13:50.591 --> 00:13:53.200
that don't have,
you know,
they don't speak loud,
they aren't clear,

256
00:13:53.201 --> 00:13:56.520
they can't make decisions,
but just out of sheer sort of force of will,
there's,

257
00:13:57.490 --> 00:14:00.820
there's all these little aspects that you have you can improve upon right now

258
00:14:00.821 --> 00:14:01.930
you you're not going to take,

259
00:14:01.931 --> 00:14:06.931
I'm not going to lie to you and say you can take somebody that has no aptitude

260
00:14:07.181 --> 00:14:09.250
for leadership and they're going to turn into a great leader.

261
00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:11.020
That's probably not going to happen,

262
00:14:11.470 --> 00:14:16.150
but you can't take someone that has minimal aptitude for leadership and they can

263
00:14:16.151 --> 00:14:18.220
improve the areas where they need to improve.

264
00:14:18.340 --> 00:14:22.390
They can compliment themselves with a team that can cover for the areas where

265
00:14:22.391 --> 00:14:25.120
they're weak and they can end up doing a great job in a leadership position for

266
00:14:25.121 --> 00:14:27.760
sure.
Yeah.
So handing some of this stuff off,

267
00:14:27.761 --> 00:14:30.340
people don't think of that in certain ways when it comes to leaders,

268
00:14:30.341 --> 00:14:32.560
like they have to do everything or know everything or something.

269
00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:35.410
But actually hand in some of this stuff off is,
is good.

270
00:14:35.411 --> 00:14:40.060
Delegating actually is good.
Oh yeah,
absolutely.
Like for instance,
big shocker,

271
00:14:40.061 --> 00:14:42.810
I don't really like doing paperwork a lot,
you know what I mean?

272
00:14:42.820 --> 00:14:46.000
Really it's [inaudible].
I know it might seem odd,

273
00:14:46.001 --> 00:14:47.950
but I always had guys that worked for me.

274
00:14:47.951 --> 00:14:51.590
I'd figured out that guy that was really good at administrative stuff and there

275
00:14:51.591 --> 00:14:52.161
you go.
Guess what?

276
00:14:52.161 --> 00:14:54.620
He's going to do a bunch of administrative stuff and that's great.

277
00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:58.250
And so whatever areas of weakness you have,
have some,
you know,

278
00:14:58.280 --> 00:15:00.470
get a member of your team,
recruit someone,

279
00:15:00.471 --> 00:15:03.590
bring someone on board that can actually make these things happen and it'll work

280
00:15:03.591 --> 00:15:04.490
out great.
Yeah.

281
00:15:04.491 --> 00:15:09.491
Are you kind of surprised how much we need a leadership sort of in society right

282
00:15:10.311 --> 00:15:13.910
now that we seem to have like a complete dearth of leadership?
I mean,

283
00:15:13.911 --> 00:15:15.170
you mentioned Jordan Peterson before.

284
00:15:15.171 --> 00:15:17.750
When I see the message that he's bringing to these people,

285
00:15:17.751 --> 00:15:20.390
it's really about getting yourself together,
which is the most,

286
00:15:20.450 --> 00:15:23.180
I mean it's very consistent with your message,
but,
but there's,

287
00:15:23.270 --> 00:15:26.090
but the people that are coming are sort of looking for a leader to say that,

288
00:15:26.091 --> 00:15:30.430
that we just don't have,
had seemingly don't have good leaders right now.
Do,

289
00:15:30.460 --> 00:15:34.430
do you think that's a fair estimation?
Well,
we do have good leaders.

290
00:15:34.431 --> 00:15:37.430
There's plenty of good leaders out there and I see him all the time in the

291
00:15:37.431 --> 00:15:38.150
business world.

292
00:15:38.150 --> 00:15:40.550
I still work with the military and there's great leaders inside the military.

293
00:15:40.551 --> 00:15:42.350
There's great leaders inside of the business world for sure.

294
00:15:42.710 --> 00:15:46.580
There's also always a lack of leadership.
And I mean,
I,
you know,

295
00:15:46.581 --> 00:15:47.930
on my podcast I'd cover,

296
00:15:48.470 --> 00:15:51.770
I cover books about war generally first person accounts,

297
00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:54.640
and there's a lack of leadership back then and there's going to be theirs.

298
00:15:54.740 --> 00:15:57.620
So I don't know if it's gotten any better or worse,

299
00:15:58.340 --> 00:16:02.270
but the fact of the matter is that leadership is,

300
00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:06.980
is the hardest thing in the world as far as I know.
It's,
it's the hardest thing.

301
00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:09.410
You know,
people used to ask me when I,
when I first got out of the military,

302
00:16:09.740 --> 00:16:12.650
what was the most complex,
you know,
operation that you would plan on.

303
00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:16.340
Planning operations isn't that big of a deal.
Like here's a bad guy,

304
00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:18.530
here's the assets that we have,

305
00:16:18.531 --> 00:16:19.910
here's what we're going to do to go take them out.
I mean,

306
00:16:19.911 --> 00:16:24.320
this is stuff that generally it's not that hard to do,

307
00:16:24.350 --> 00:16:26.150
but the hard part is,
is leading human beings.

308
00:16:26.151 --> 00:16:29.900
And so why does it seem like there's that we need better leadership because you

309
00:16:29.901 --> 00:16:33.650
always need better leadership and because leadership is so hard to actually do

310
00:16:33.651 --> 00:16:34.610
properly.
Yeah.

311
00:16:34.670 --> 00:16:38.180
Do you think we need some sort of mandatory military service to get some of this

312
00:16:38.181 --> 00:16:39.890
through to young people?

313
00:16:40.730 --> 00:16:44.350
I think military service is great for people.
I know it was,

314
00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:47.990
it was great for me and it,
it worked out really well for me,

315
00:16:47.991 --> 00:16:49.520
but I really don't believe in,

316
00:16:49.550 --> 00:16:54.550
in mandatory service because I really don't believe that it's good for

317
00:16:55.130 --> 00:16:59.960
government to tell people what you need to do.
Yeah,
I don't really support that,

318
00:16:59.961 --> 00:17:04.610
but I definitely support and encourage everyone to go in the reserves,
you know,

319
00:17:04.611 --> 00:17:06.500
go join that,
join the army or the Marine Corps,

320
00:17:06.501 --> 00:17:09.720
the Navy Air Force reserves where you go away for,
you know,

321
00:17:10.040 --> 00:17:13.190
six weeks or eight weeks and you kind of learn what the military is about and

322
00:17:13.191 --> 00:17:17.480
then you do one weekend a month and two weeks in the summertime for you know,

323
00:17:17.540 --> 00:17:21.800
indefinitely.
So I think I have a pretty good handle on your politics,
but do you,

324
00:17:21.820 --> 00:17:26.700
do you even have a label that kind of works for you politically?
Uh,
I dunno.

325
00:17:27.380 --> 00:17:29.820
I Dunno.
I don't know what the label,
I don't know how they,

326
00:17:29.910 --> 00:17:31.040
I think it'd be pretty hard to label.

327
00:17:31.050 --> 00:17:34.430
If you were just sort of summing up sort of your political beliefs,

328
00:17:34.850 --> 00:17:38.390
what would you say?
I think that,

329
00:17:38.990 --> 00:17:41.240
I guess a broad statement would be,

330
00:17:41.241 --> 00:17:45.750
I don't think that the government is the solution to our problems.
Yeah.

331
00:17:46.010 --> 00:17:50.280
I think that generally unleashing individuals to try and make things happen is

332
00:17:50.281 --> 00:17:54.240
the best way for things to work.
It's,
it's consistent with decentralized command.

333
00:17:54.241 --> 00:17:56.790
Go to talk,
talk about in the,
in the first book that I wrote with my,

334
00:17:57.100 --> 00:18:02.010
my brother life is
you can't control everything.
You know,

335
00:18:02.011 --> 00:18:06.480
centralized decision making does not work.
It doesn't work on the battlefield,

336
00:18:06.510 --> 00:18:09.240
it doesn't work in business.
It doesn't work with governments.

337
00:18:09.390 --> 00:18:12.550
So that's broadly speaking,
Guy,

338
00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:16.360
I don't think that the government should control what individuals are doing as

339
00:18:16.470 --> 00:18:19.230
little as possible.
Do there have to be some rules and regulations in place?

340
00:18:19.290 --> 00:18:22.380
Absolutely.
But the framework should be as loose as possible.

341
00:18:22.381 --> 00:18:26.400
Just like if I'm running a seal platoon,
it's not every man for himself.

342
00:18:26.610 --> 00:18:28.950
It's here's our standard operating procedures,

343
00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:32.550
here's the areas where we commit to disciplined process.

344
00:18:32.670 --> 00:18:36.000
But then once you understand those and you know those,

345
00:18:36.150 --> 00:18:40.290
you're allowed to operate freely within those guidelines to execute the mission.

346
00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:44.150
And that's what works.
That's what makes not just the seal teams.

347
00:18:44.151 --> 00:18:45.630
That's what makes any good military unit good.

348
00:18:45.780 --> 00:18:48.030
And that's what makes good businesses good.

349
00:18:48.270 --> 00:18:51.300
Good businesses are good because someone is micromanaging every single decision.

350
00:18:51.630 --> 00:18:55.050
Good businesses are good because people broadly understand the direction they're

351
00:18:55.051 --> 00:18:55.710
heading.

352
00:18:55.710 --> 00:18:59.190
They understand that and they're allowed to move forward as they see fit.

353
00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:01.140
Are you shocked when you say something like that?

354
00:19:01.141 --> 00:19:03.060
Which obviously I agree with 100% I mean,

355
00:19:03.061 --> 00:19:07.290
all I talk about here is personal responsibility over and over that that doesn't

356
00:19:07.291 --> 00:19:11.490
seem to sort of be the kind of flavor of the day at the moment that this,

357
00:19:11.790 --> 00:19:14.280
if you listen to mainstream media,
it's who are the more,
well,

358
00:19:14.281 --> 00:19:17.160
the government should give you this and we should take from some of them give to

359
00:19:17.180 --> 00:19:20.640
others that there's a more feeling of you.

360
00:19:20.730 --> 00:19:23.400
You are owed something rather than you got to get something.

361
00:19:24.390 --> 00:19:27.810
You're asking if I'm surprised by that.
Yeah,
because it,

362
00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:31.290
because the way you're laying it out,
it's obvious.
You know what I mean?

363
00:19:31.291 --> 00:19:34.980
Like I mean that in the best sense,
it's obvious like,
yeah,
it's your life.
Go,

364
00:19:34.981 --> 00:19:38.760
go do something that has value in and creates real easy answers.
No,

365
00:19:38.761 --> 00:19:43.761
I'm not surprised by it at all because if I come here and offer you something

366
00:19:43.771 --> 00:19:47.910
for free,
why would you not want it?
Why would you not want to take it?
If I say,

367
00:19:47.911 --> 00:19:51.630
Hey,
you can have this house for free,
and you'd say,
okay,

368
00:19:51.631 --> 00:19:55.230
that seems like a good deal to me.
Right.
And so yeah,
sure.

369
00:19:55.231 --> 00:20:00.120
I understand why people think that sounds like a good idea because it's

370
00:20:00.150 --> 00:20:03.870
something for free and they want to in their own individual oral,
they think,

371
00:20:03.871 --> 00:20:06.540
okay,
I do want to take advantage of this,
right.
Get something for free.

372
00:20:06.810 --> 00:20:10.560
So it doesn't surprise me at all that what is unfortunate is if you can't draw

373
00:20:10.561 --> 00:20:12.210
the line between,
hey,

374
00:20:12.211 --> 00:20:15.900
everyone gets everything for free and there's a price to that that somebody's

375
00:20:15.901 --> 00:20:16.734
going to have to pay.

376
00:20:17.010 --> 00:20:21.150
That's where it becomes a part in some costs in there somewhere,
somewhere.
Yeah.

377
00:20:21.270 --> 00:20:23.340
So tell me what it was like when you started writing,

378
00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:27.150
because that must've been a whole other ball of wax.
You know,
it was,

379
00:20:27.151 --> 00:20:29.370
I was actually an English major in college and I went,

380
00:20:29.510 --> 00:20:32.220
I went to college halfway through my navy career,
started off as an enlisted guy,

381
00:20:32.420 --> 00:20:35.660
went to college and then became an officer and then went to college eventually.

382
00:20:35.670 --> 00:20:40.500
So,
and the reason I was an English major was because,
believe it or not,

383
00:20:40.530 --> 00:20:44.010
when you're an officer in the military and actually almost any job in the

384
00:20:44.011 --> 00:20:48.250
military,
you have to write.
Why not just have to write,
you have to read,

385
00:20:48.251 --> 00:20:52.720
you have to understand because you have to write concept of operations documents

386
00:20:52.721 --> 00:20:56.260
that are going to be pushed up the chain of command and they're gonna read

387
00:20:56.261 --> 00:21:01.261
through them and ask questions and and look at the document and try and

388
00:21:01.361 --> 00:21:03.190
comprehend what it is that you're trying to do.

389
00:21:03.300 --> 00:21:05.620
You've got to write evaluations for your troops and your,

390
00:21:05.670 --> 00:21:08.950
your troops are getting promoted based on the evaluations that you,
right.

391
00:21:08.951 --> 00:21:10.630
Same with awards.
You've got to write awards.

392
00:21:10.930 --> 00:21:12.790
Same thing was after actions reports.

393
00:21:12.820 --> 00:21:15.700
So if you do an operation and things don't go well,

394
00:21:15.701 --> 00:21:19.480
you have to be able to articulate and explain that what happened and then pass

395
00:21:19.481 --> 00:21:21.970
that word on.
So everyone understands now that you're,

396
00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:25.960
you're being given direction.
Verbal direction.
Yes,
of course.

397
00:21:25.961 --> 00:21:27.250
But you're given written direction as well.

398
00:21:27.251 --> 00:21:32.080
You're given missions in a written format or you're given rules of engagement in

399
00:21:32.081 --> 00:21:33.940
a written format written by lawyers.

400
00:21:34.570 --> 00:21:39.130
And I realized while I was a young enlisted guy,
and then as a junior officer,

401
00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:44.760
what I really need to be able to do is understand and communicate well up and

402
00:21:45.821 --> 00:21:48.730
down the chain of command.
So when I went to college I said,
yeah,

403
00:21:48.731 --> 00:21:52.900
I want to learn English,
I want to get good at it.
And so that's what I did.

404
00:21:52.901 --> 00:21:56.220
And so obviously I did a bunch of writing and a ton of reading when I was in,

405
00:21:56.290 --> 00:21:57.820
when I was an English major in college.

406
00:21:58.390 --> 00:22:01.840
And then when I was in the military is writing,
you're writing all the time.

407
00:22:02.380 --> 00:22:03.610
And then when,

408
00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:08.440
when when I got out and I was working with these companies and grew really

409
00:22:08.441 --> 00:22:09.820
quickly,
and that's why my,

410
00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:12.910
my buddy who was one of the platoon commanders that worked for me in the battle

411
00:22:12.911 --> 00:22:17.440
of Ramadi,
Leif Babin,
he,
he was getting out of the navy too.

412
00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:20.350
And I,
you know,
as we started I started need some cover and I said,
hey man,

413
00:22:20.351 --> 00:22:21.970
you want to want to jump in and get some of this?

414
00:22:21.971 --> 00:22:25.120
And he was all on board and then as we started doing this,

415
00:22:25.121 --> 00:22:27.550
people would always say,
Hey,
do you have this stuff written down anywhere?

416
00:22:27.670 --> 00:22:28.930
Do you have a document you can give us?

417
00:22:28.931 --> 00:22:30.700
And so we eventually wrote it down and then that's how the,

418
00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:32.200
that's how the first book came.
Yeah.

419
00:22:32.230 --> 00:22:35.050
Can you lay out a little bit about the battle of Ramadi?
You basically,

420
00:22:35.110 --> 00:22:36.760
you sort of wrote the plans.

421
00:22:36.910 --> 00:22:41.910
The person that led the battle of Amati that I was in was a guy named Shawn

422
00:22:42.370 --> 00:22:45.280
Mcfarland who was a colonel at the time.
He retired as a general,

423
00:22:45.550 --> 00:22:47.050
just a super smart,

424
00:22:48.250 --> 00:22:51.540
incredibly competent and,
and great leaders,

425
00:22:51.550 --> 00:22:55.900
have great leader and key came in with,
so I had 40 seals with me,
right?

426
00:22:55.920 --> 00:22:58.390
I had 40 sales with me and 60 support people.

427
00:22:59.260 --> 00:23:04.260
Colonel Mcfarlane had 5,600 man armored brigade that we supported and we helped

428
00:23:04.871 --> 00:23:08.170
them.
We work together in the battle of Ramadi,
vicious fighting.

429
00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:09.280
Very tough battle.

430
00:23:09.640 --> 00:23:14.640
And really took a city that was completely controlled by the insurgence in 2005

431
00:23:16.031 --> 00:23:21.031
2006 and by early 2007 it was almost completely pacified.

432
00:23:22.060 --> 00:23:24.580
So it was a,
it was incredible.
It was incredible,

433
00:23:24.581 --> 00:23:29.581
incredible turnaround and an incredible testament to the capability of the US

434
00:23:32.621 --> 00:23:33.454
armed forces.

435
00:23:33.940 --> 00:23:38.140
Do you guys pay any attention to what's going on politically back home when

436
00:23:38.141 --> 00:23:42.580
you're halfway across the world?
Yes,
absolutely.

437
00:23:42.610 --> 00:23:44.470
You have to pay attention to what's going on politically.

438
00:23:44.530 --> 00:23:48.830
Back [inaudible] especially like at this time when we deployed to Ramadi,

439
00:23:48.831 --> 00:23:53.831
so it's 2005 2006 this is smack dab in the middle of the rising negative public

440
00:23:57.351 --> 00:23:58.790
opinion about the war in Iraq.

441
00:23:59.120 --> 00:24:03.110
It's also where we had our own government officials here in America that we're

442
00:24:03.111 --> 00:24:07.070
saying this is unwinnable,
this is another Vietnam.
This is a quagmire.

443
00:24:07.730 --> 00:24:10.340
We shouldn't be there to bring everyone home.
So yeah,

444
00:24:10.420 --> 00:24:14.780
you absolutely hear those things and that's not good.
That's not,

445
00:24:14.781 --> 00:24:15.830
it's not a positive thing.

446
00:24:15.980 --> 00:24:19.550
It's not a positive thing to have your own government officials in America

447
00:24:19.580 --> 00:24:20.930
saying that you cannot win.

448
00:24:21.320 --> 00:24:23.840
And meanwhile you're going out on an operation does that,

449
00:24:23.841 --> 00:24:26.240
that must drive you guys crazy more than anything else that's sort of the

450
00:24:26.241 --> 00:24:29.870
political elite that often have no idea what's happening on the ground that are

451
00:24:29.871 --> 00:24:33.530
just spouting off stuff.
For sure,
for sure,

452
00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:35.120
but as I said,

453
00:24:35.121 --> 00:24:38.810
it's you listened to it but you can only pay so much attention to it.

454
00:24:39.010 --> 00:24:42.650
There's so much other things to focus on.
I mean

455
00:24:44.330 --> 00:24:45.710
you think about it a little bit,

456
00:24:46.010 --> 00:24:50.750
but you're not caught up in the 24 hour news cycle like you know like people

457
00:24:51.080 --> 00:24:55.610
contend to do here in America because you're working and you're getting back

458
00:24:55.611 --> 00:24:57.500
from one operation,
you're preparing for another operation.

459
00:24:57.500 --> 00:25:00.440
I've got guys in the field,
I got another element in the field.

460
00:25:00.530 --> 00:25:03.410
I'm going in the field.
It's,
you don't have time to be sitting around,
hey,

461
00:25:03.411 --> 00:25:06.530
I wonder what this politician is saying about what we're doing,

462
00:25:06.650 --> 00:25:08.990
how much you have of leadership that you brought to,

463
00:25:08.991 --> 00:25:11.840
it was just about managing stress for your guys.

464
00:25:11.860 --> 00:25:15.500
Just making sure that they were actually okay in the midst of the chaos.

465
00:25:16.250 --> 00:25:20.120
You absolutely you have to do.
Some of that.
I mean it's,
it's a,

466
00:25:20.300 --> 00:25:22.490
it's a balancing act between all kinds.

467
00:25:22.520 --> 00:25:25.130
There's all kinds of things that you're trying to juggle at the same time.

468
00:25:25.340 --> 00:25:27.410
And managing stress on the guys is definitely one of them.

469
00:25:28.040 --> 00:25:31.370
And in a situation where you're getting guys wounded and your guys are getting

470
00:25:31.371 --> 00:25:35.180
killed,
that stress meter can get pegged out pretty quick.

471
00:25:35.210 --> 00:25:38.930
So you have to manage it.
You have to do it to the best ability.

472
00:25:39.020 --> 00:25:42.590
That's it's,
it's hard.
It's hard to,
because

473
00:25:44.330 --> 00:25:47.990
the war is going to keep going and you are going to keep you,

474
00:25:47.991 --> 00:25:49.850
you have work that needs to continue.

475
00:25:50.210 --> 00:25:54.050
So the stress is going to build up on,
on the troops.

476
00:25:54.051 --> 00:25:56.290
And it's different for every guy.
You know,
the,

477
00:25:56.490 --> 00:25:59.750
the front line seal or soldier or marine,

478
00:26:00.230 --> 00:26:01.760
they're worried about getting blown up.

479
00:26:01.790 --> 00:26:03.170
They're worried about getting shot and killed.

480
00:26:03.260 --> 00:26:04.910
They're worried about their friends getting shot and killed.

481
00:26:04.911 --> 00:26:06.530
They're worried about their friends getting blown up.

482
00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:08.390
And when you're in charge of a bunch of guys you're in,

483
00:26:08.450 --> 00:26:10.820
you're worried about all those guys and that happening to them.

484
00:26:10.970 --> 00:26:15.500
You're worried about if we make a mistake,
if we do something wrong,

485
00:26:15.501 --> 00:26:19.160
if we cause some massive collateral damage that has a negative strategic impact,

486
00:26:19.220 --> 00:26:23.330
like not you have all those stresses and you know,
to control stress,

487
00:26:23.331 --> 00:26:26.510
what do you do that it's like you look at the things you can control and the

488
00:26:26.511 --> 00:26:28.020
things you can't control.
Yeah.

489
00:26:28.250 --> 00:26:31.640
You focus on the things you can control and the things that you can't control.

490
00:26:31.641 --> 00:26:34.970
You do your best to mitigate and then you don't worry about them because they'll

491
00:26:34.971 --> 00:26:38.960
drive you crazy.
Yeah.
What do you make of sort of where we're at now,

492
00:26:38.990 --> 00:26:43.250
having lived through the Iraq war,
like was it the right thing to do?

493
00:26:43.290 --> 00:26:45.270
Should we have done things differently?
You should.

494
00:26:45.271 --> 00:26:48.810
We have not just announced we were leaving one day,
the the whole,

495
00:26:48.990 --> 00:26:49.770
the whole thing.

496
00:26:49.770 --> 00:26:54.770
The whole thing is that hindsight is 2020 and any normal human being can look

497
00:26:55.291 --> 00:27:00.291
back at the American history as a whole and find out all the mistakes that we've

498
00:27:00.511 --> 00:27:04.050
made,
which are,
you know,
infinite,
right?

499
00:27:04.330 --> 00:27:08.010
We make an infinite number of mistakes and we do the best to try and repair

500
00:27:08.011 --> 00:27:09.850
those ones they've taken place though.

501
00:27:11.070 --> 00:27:14.100
So for me to look at it from that angle,
it's like,
okay,
yeah,

502
00:27:14.130 --> 00:27:16.960
there's all kinds of mistakes we make as a country and we have make as a country

503
00:27:16.961 --> 00:27:18.030
and we will make as a country.

504
00:27:19.110 --> 00:27:22.980
But the best way for me to kind of rationalize or not even rationalize because I

505
00:27:22.981 --> 00:27:25.710
don't think it needs rationalization,
but I,

506
00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:28.710
when I look at it from a granular level,
which is,

507
00:27:30.120 --> 00:27:34.140
which is very straightforward,
we went into a city,

508
00:27:34.890 --> 00:27:39.510
the city of Ramadi that was being controlled by

509
00:27:41.890 --> 00:27:46.890
sick in surgeons do most sadistic,

510
00:27:47.280 --> 00:27:51.750
evil,
subhuman people that you can imagine.

511
00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:56.370
They were raping,
torturing,
skinning people alive,

512
00:27:56.430 --> 00:28:01.320
murdering whole families,
beheading people.
And when we went in there,

513
00:28:01.321 --> 00:28:04.230
and again,
I'm not talking about we as this small group of seals,

514
00:28:04.231 --> 00:28:09.231
I'm talking about when this massive force of us coalition and Iraqi forces went

515
00:28:10.711 --> 00:28:15.711
into that city and liberated those people from the torturous and sadistic

516
00:28:19.500 --> 00:28:21.300
control of those insurgents.

517
00:28:21.780 --> 00:28:24.570
The people of Ramadi were overjoyed.

518
00:28:24.990 --> 00:28:29.780
And they would cheer when we killed insurgents and they would tell us where in

519
00:28:29.781 --> 00:28:33.960
surgeons were.
And it was a beautiful transition to watch.

520
00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:36.720
And it didn't really take place until after we left.
But after we left,

521
00:28:36.721 --> 00:28:40.710
we saw this.
It was peaceful.
It was literally peaceful.

522
00:28:40.740 --> 00:28:44.070
It went from a complete war zone to a,
to a peaceful city.

523
00:28:44.790 --> 00:28:48.630
And where they were,
they had markets open the street again.

524
00:28:48.631 --> 00:28:52.260
They had kids going to school,
they had girls schools.
Now,
you know,
that they're,

525
00:28:52.330 --> 00:28:55.560
there wasn't in the city of Ramadi,
it was schools for girls.

526
00:28:56.040 --> 00:28:59.280
And this was just unheard of while the insurgence where they're trying to,

527
00:28:59.430 --> 00:29:00.450
you know,
uh,

528
00:29:01.230 --> 00:29:06.230
punish the populous with their psychotic brand of,

529
00:29:06.600 --> 00:29:09.950
of Al Qaeda Islam.
Right.
And,
and the,

530
00:29:09.980 --> 00:29:13.110
the people of Ramadi did not want that at all.

531
00:29:13.890 --> 00:29:18.540
And so from that perspective,
it's like I go to sleep every night.

532
00:29:18.630 --> 00:29:23.100
The only regret that I have is that we couldn't do more.
Because guess what?

533
00:29:23.460 --> 00:29:26.730
After America did pull out isis took Ramadi,

534
00:29:27.060 --> 00:29:29.400
and when they got in Ramadi and we had friends that were there,

535
00:29:30.180 --> 00:29:34.410
Isis went and found the families that had worked with coalition forces

536
00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:38.100
prevalently and they murdered about 500 families.

537
00:29:38.280 --> 00:29:42.010
So that sickens my heart.
That's horrible.

538
00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:43.420
So when you hear that politically,

539
00:29:43.421 --> 00:29:45.340
it sort of gets back to what were talking about earlier that,
you know,

540
00:29:45.341 --> 00:29:47.920
when they say,
all right,
well we're going to get out this day.
Like it's,
oh,

541
00:29:47.921 --> 00:29:50.200
it's gotta be over.
We got in this thing,
we've got to get out this day.

542
00:29:50.201 --> 00:29:54.040
And you know that that's counter to what you've learned sort of on the ground.

543
00:29:54.490 --> 00:29:57.550
That's just gotta be the worst thing you could hear.
Yeah.
One of the words,

544
00:29:57.580 --> 00:30:01.300
even if you don't want a conflict to continue,
first of all,

545
00:30:01.390 --> 00:30:06.390
there's no one that wants conflict less than the people that have to go and

546
00:30:08.141 --> 00:30:10.930
fight it.
Right.
When when we sign up for a war,

547
00:30:11.050 --> 00:30:14.320
it's my friends and not just my friends,

548
00:30:14.321 --> 00:30:18.420
but it's the military that's going to go out and die.
When,

549
00:30:18.440 --> 00:30:23.230
when we sign up,
oh,
there's a conflict we need to take care of.
So yes,
uh,

550
00:30:23.290 --> 00:30:27.490
we don't want to go to war.
If you go to war,
you go to war to win.

551
00:30:28.780 --> 00:30:33.340
In the situation that happened in Iraq,
we pulled out completely.

552
00:30:33.580 --> 00:30:38.350
There was not,
there was no one that had fought in Iraq that thought,

553
00:30:38.351 --> 00:30:40.740
oh good call,
that's a great call there.

554
00:30:40.741 --> 00:30:43.450
There was embers of the inserts of the insurgency had been,

555
00:30:43.480 --> 00:30:47.200
had been all but crushed,
but it had not been completely extinguished.

556
00:30:47.201 --> 00:30:51.370
And there were embers of insurgents that were there.

557
00:30:51.430 --> 00:30:53.290
And as soon as we pulled out,
they started growing.

558
00:30:53.291 --> 00:30:56.860
And that's what turned into Isis.
Yeah.
So that's,
that's around 2008 ish,
right?

559
00:30:56.861 --> 00:30:58.450
Something like that.
Yeah.
So then what,

560
00:30:58.510 --> 00:31:02.650
what is sort of a more sensible way of leaving something?
So you could,

561
00:31:02.660 --> 00:31:04.180
you do a certain amount of cleanup,
let's say,

562
00:31:04.181 --> 00:31:07.210
and you freeze some of these cities and,
and good things have happened,

563
00:31:07.780 --> 00:31:10.850
but you don't want to be there forever.
How,
how do you manage that?

564
00:31:11.050 --> 00:31:14.920
That end with the stresses of just the political machinations and all that
stuff?

565
00:31:14.940 --> 00:31:15.701
Yeah,
I mean that's,

566
00:31:15.701 --> 00:31:18.610
that's something that you have to look at every situation that you're in and you

567
00:31:18.611 --> 00:31:21.170
have to say,
okay,
well what can we do here?
How,

568
00:31:21.360 --> 00:31:23.980
how much can we draw down our troops?
And it's not,

569
00:31:24.190 --> 00:31:27.310
it's not a certain amount of time.
It's not a certain amount of troops.

570
00:31:27.640 --> 00:31:32.620
You have to look at each situation and doing assessment and figure out the best

571
00:31:32.621 --> 00:31:36.300
way to move forward and guess what,
you won't,
you won't be perfect.
And,

572
00:31:36.490 --> 00:31:38.860
and that's why an absolute thing like,
hey,
we're just gonna,

573
00:31:38.890 --> 00:31:42.550
we're not going to do this anymore,
is a risky move.
So what do you think's go?

574
00:31:42.551 --> 00:31:46.330
So like when Obama did that,
what do you think his military leaders who,

575
00:31:46.331 --> 00:31:49.090
I'm sure you probably respect some of them or maybe even know some of them.

576
00:31:49.270 --> 00:31:52.570
What do you think they were telling him that because it's so counter to what

577
00:31:52.571 --> 00:31:57.070
you're laying out here.
I'm sure they told them,
this is not a good idea.

578
00:31:59.050 --> 00:32:01.690
This is not a good idea.
There's,
like I said,

579
00:32:01.691 --> 00:32:05.140
there's no one that had spent time on the ground in Iraq that said,
Oh,

580
00:32:05.141 --> 00:32:07.090
you know what?
We're good.
Let's leave.

581
00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:11.380
Because it was still a very,

582
00:32:12.700 --> 00:32:16.690
a very fragile situation,
you know,
and it looked good.

583
00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:19.780
It looked good on paper.
But you have to give the,

584
00:32:19.890 --> 00:32:24.890
the civilian populace enough time to really kind of figure out how to live this

585
00:32:26.411 --> 00:32:27.700
way because this is a new way to live.

586
00:32:28.630 --> 00:32:33.630
You're oppressed under Saddam than you're oppressed under some insurgency.

587
00:32:34.300 --> 00:32:38.110
And to have that be lifted and then say,
okay,
we look around,

588
00:32:38.590 --> 00:32:42.080
it's gonna take some time to figure out how we're going to do this.

589
00:32:42.290 --> 00:32:46.370
And we needed to provide them with enough security and stabilization that they

590
00:32:46.371 --> 00:32:50.570
could have.
And it's not like we were working hard.
The last few Lafe uh,

591
00:32:50.630 --> 00:32:52.520
who wrote the book books with me,

592
00:32:52.910 --> 00:32:56.360
he deployed in 2010 I want to say they had,

593
00:32:57.160 --> 00:32:58.910
so while I was in Ramadi,

594
00:32:59.390 --> 00:33:03.610
there was a guy wounded or killed almost every day for the six months and we

595
00:33:03.611 --> 00:33:06.050
were,
there was a guy wounded or killed almost everyday in Ramadi,
sometimes two,

596
00:33:06.051 --> 00:33:08.330
sometimes five,
sometimes seven,
sometimes one.

597
00:33:09.140 --> 00:33:11.900
When Lafe went back to Al Anbar province,

598
00:33:11.901 --> 00:33:16.250
so Lmr province that the province that Ramadi is the capital of.

599
00:33:16.370 --> 00:33:17.720
In his six month deployment,

600
00:33:18.410 --> 00:33:23.060
there was one fatality for all of coalition forces money who is from a vehicle

601
00:33:23.061 --> 00:33:25.160
rollover.
Wow.
So it was,

602
00:33:25.220 --> 00:33:29.720
it wasn't like we were over there gutting it out anymore with the insurgents.

603
00:33:29.930 --> 00:33:32.150
The insurgents had been really,

604
00:33:32.180 --> 00:33:37.180
really suppressed and we just needed to give the locals enough time to kind of

605
00:33:37.820 --> 00:33:40.640
put things together and start to move forward and become stable,

606
00:33:41.150 --> 00:33:43.070
politically stable,
economically stable.

607
00:33:43.640 --> 00:33:46.310
And that is what we should've done.

608
00:33:46.790 --> 00:33:50.840
Do you think it's our moral responsibility to,
to do actions like this?
If we,

609
00:33:50.841 --> 00:33:54.500
if we can help people that are living in these horrible situations that,

610
00:33:54.560 --> 00:33:58.400
that morally and at we,
I mean we,
the United States have to do it.

611
00:34:00.230 --> 00:34:05.230
I think that we have to weigh the morality of taking care of other people and

612
00:34:06.621 --> 00:34:10.310
taking care of our own people.
Right?
So when you,

613
00:34:10.340 --> 00:34:13.850
and this is a very difficult decision to make and some that I've talked about on

614
00:34:13.851 --> 00:34:17.060
my podcast was the genocide in Rwanda.

615
00:34:17.150 --> 00:34:22.150
So the genocide in Rwanda happened and there was 800,000 Tutsis that were killed

616
00:34:24.471 --> 00:34:26.900
by Hutus in a hundred days.

617
00:34:26.930 --> 00:34:30.260
So this is more efficient than Hitler was able to pull it off.
And by the way,

618
00:34:30.261 --> 00:34:34.490
most of the killing was done,
98% of the killing was done with machetes.

619
00:34:34.520 --> 00:34:38.150
So this was just crazy when that was happening,

620
00:34:38.300 --> 00:34:43.300
I was sitting off the coast with a Inicio platoon on a ship with a bunch of

621
00:34:43.401 --> 00:34:45.650
marines,
a bunch of navy power,

622
00:34:46.190 --> 00:34:49.850
and we could have gone in there and done something.
And we did.

623
00:34:50.600 --> 00:34:55.070
And I would say that the primary reason that we didn't is because a year
earlier,

624
00:34:55.460 --> 00:34:59.030
Black Hawk down had happened and we lost a bunch of service members in Somalia.

625
00:34:59.180 --> 00:35:00.740
And so I was like,
hmm,
you know what?

626
00:35:00.770 --> 00:35:02.900
We don't really want to get involved in that again.

627
00:35:03.350 --> 00:35:06.290
And so that's what we have to weigh is we have to wait,

628
00:35:06.320 --> 00:35:10.550
what are we willing to lose in order to save someone else?

629
00:35:10.880 --> 00:35:14.450
And then what do we benefit from saving those people?

630
00:35:15.080 --> 00:35:17.900
And is that benefit worth the,

631
00:35:18.470 --> 00:35:22.820
the expense in money and lives that we invest into it.

632
00:35:23.030 --> 00:35:26.480
And sure some of that benefit is feeling like we can look ourselves in the

633
00:35:26.481 --> 00:35:29.400
mirror as a country.
That's part of the benefit.
Part of the benefit might,

634
00:35:29.420 --> 00:35:32.180
sure there's economic benefits.
Sure there's political benefit.

635
00:35:32.330 --> 00:35:35.450
But part of the benefit is can we look in the mirror and say,
you know what,

636
00:35:36.260 --> 00:35:40.860
we almost a million people were butchered in this country and we didn't do

637
00:35:40.861 --> 00:35:44.490
anything about it.
That's something that we have to contend with.

638
00:35:44.491 --> 00:35:46.620
And that's why these decisions are hard to make.
And,

639
00:35:46.950 --> 00:35:50.580
and when you do make these commitments as a country,

640
00:35:50.640 --> 00:35:55.640
then you need to commit and not go halfhearted into these efforts.

641
00:35:55.770 --> 00:35:57.690
If you're gonna,
if you're gonna risk American lives,

642
00:35:57.780 --> 00:36:00.900
you better be doing it for a reason.
That is,

643
00:36:01.110 --> 00:36:05.010
that merits putting our,
our men and women at risk.

644
00:36:05.310 --> 00:36:09.270
What do you make of the catch 22 that America's in with this dilemma all the

645
00:36:09.271 --> 00:36:12.120
time where it's like,
if we don't do anything,
no one does it,

646
00:36:12.330 --> 00:36:13.950
but then every time we do do something,

647
00:36:13.951 --> 00:36:16.770
there's always the unintended consequences and how long do we have to be there

648
00:36:16.771 --> 00:36:18.450
and everything else.
It's a really,
it's a,

649
00:36:18.451 --> 00:36:23.130
it's a strange bargain that America's sort of put in or put itself in.

650
00:36:23.520 --> 00:36:25.000
Well,
yeah.
Then this is,

651
00:36:25.650 --> 00:36:28.320
we started off this conversation talking about leadership and why leadership is

652
00:36:28.321 --> 00:36:32.820
so hard.
Leadership is hard because decisions,
it's not two plus two equals four.

653
00:36:33.090 --> 00:36:37.600
It's,
it's,
it's not that at all.
There's this insane amount of calculus and,

654
00:36:38.070 --> 00:36:42.510
and secondary and tertiary things that happen after you make a move that you

655
00:36:42.511 --> 00:36:46.980
think is good.
This is what makes it so hard.
And that's why,

656
00:36:47.220 --> 00:36:51.180
you know,
for America as the leader of the free world,
guess what?

657
00:36:51.420 --> 00:36:55.290
Being in that leadership position,
it's a hard position to be in.
And,

658
00:36:55.440 --> 00:36:58.170
and guess what?
Just like a leader,
just like when I was a leader,

659
00:36:58.200 --> 00:37:00.350
when I was a leader of a scope to them,
when I was a leader of a seal task.

660
00:37:00.360 --> 00:37:04.830
[inaudible] did I do everything perfect?
Absolutely not.
I made mistakes.

661
00:37:04.950 --> 00:37:07.230
I made mistakes,
I made mistakes where people died.

662
00:37:07.950 --> 00:37:11.580
And that is the burden of leadership that you bear.

663
00:37:11.760 --> 00:37:16.020
And so as a nation,
we're in the same situation.
The things that we do,

664
00:37:16.021 --> 00:37:20.040
we are not going to do things perfectly.
We have to do them with the best intent,

665
00:37:20.160 --> 00:37:24.840
which I believe we do.
But things are going to go perfectly.

666
00:37:24.990 --> 00:37:29.190
And guess what?
Some people are going to be mad when you make those mistakes.

667
00:37:29.220 --> 00:37:31.830
Some people are going to be mad.
Even when you do things right,

668
00:37:31.860 --> 00:37:33.540
they're going to look at you and say,
Oh,
you shouldn't have done that.

669
00:37:33.541 --> 00:37:36.450
That was the wrong thing to do.
Okay,
here's what we weighed out.

670
00:37:36.660 --> 00:37:38.370
And you've gotta be willing to take those criticisms.

671
00:37:38.371 --> 00:37:40.440
Leadership leadership is a very hard thing.

672
00:37:40.920 --> 00:37:45.030
So what do you make of the guy in the White House now related to leadership?

673
00:37:45.031 --> 00:37:47.880
Because even if we were just to look at our act,
so it's like,
all right,
George W.

674
00:37:47.880 --> 00:37:51.840
Bush got us into Iraq.
You can argue whether that was good or bad or whatever.

675
00:37:52.440 --> 00:37:54.690
Obama got us out and as you just laid out,

676
00:37:54.691 --> 00:37:57.360
maybe the way we got out was probably not the right way to do it.

677
00:37:57.510 --> 00:38:01.080
It doesn't seem that from at least what I could tell that Trump is looking to

678
00:38:01.081 --> 00:38:04.350
get us into extra wars or anything like that.
Well,

679
00:38:04.380 --> 00:38:07.180
it certainly doesn't seem like he's looking to get us into any extra words.

680
00:38:07.181 --> 00:38:11.760
I would agree with that.
And again,
there's,

681
00:38:11.850 --> 00:38:13.590
I don't believe that,
hey,

682
00:38:13.591 --> 00:38:17.610
we're going to be an isolationist nation and we're not gonna play on the world

683
00:38:17.611 --> 00:38:21.510
stage.
I don't think that's the best thing.
The other end of the spectrum is,
hey,

684
00:38:21.511 --> 00:38:23.190
we're going to go fight and police up,
but world,

685
00:38:23.250 --> 00:38:24.480
that's not the right thing either.

686
00:38:24.750 --> 00:38:29.750
The right thing is to look at each situation as it unfolds in the world and

687
00:38:29.911 --> 00:38:33.760
make,
try and make the best decisions you can as a leader at that time.
And,

688
00:38:33.880 --> 00:38:37.780
and again,
these are not easy decisions to make.
These are,

689
00:38:38.980 --> 00:38:40.220
these are decisions that,

690
00:38:40.290 --> 00:38:44.920
that you make them and they still unfold the day after you make a decision.

691
00:38:45.400 --> 00:38:49.810
The minute after you make a decisions,
things unfold that you didn't expect,

692
00:38:49.811 --> 00:38:52.690
that you didn't anticipate and yet you made a decision.

693
00:38:52.691 --> 00:38:56.350
So now you've got to make another decision.
And,
and it's,
it's a challenge.

694
00:38:56.770 --> 00:38:58.390
What do you make of him?
Just as a leader,

695
00:38:58.391 --> 00:39:01.000
if we were looking at the gray the way you would grade a leader,

696
00:39:01.660 --> 00:39:04.370
how would you look at Trump from a leadership perspective?
Yeah,

697
00:39:06.400 --> 00:39:11.400
I think Trump is an interesting characteristic of some really broad extremes,

698
00:39:13.930 --> 00:39:18.400
right?
So he does things that I say,
oh good move.

699
00:39:19.270 --> 00:39:23.950
And then literally 20 minutes later,
20 minutes later I'll be thinking of myself,

700
00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:24.880
what,
what,
what?

701
00:39:25.540 --> 00:39:30.460
How can you even think that this is a decent thing to do?

702
00:39:30.610 --> 00:39:33.370
Right?
And by that I mean,
you know,

703
00:39:33.371 --> 00:39:38.371
jumping out on Twitter and criticizing some kind of person,

704
00:39:38.570 --> 00:39:42.370
some,
some individual humans,
celebrity or celebrity.
Yeah.
Hey,
what are you doing?

705
00:39:42.440 --> 00:39:44.950
Why,
why are you doing that?
Uh,
you know,

706
00:39:44.951 --> 00:39:49.520
so I think the guy who was it that just the,

707
00:39:49.570 --> 00:39:52.660
the testimony that just took place?
Michael Color.
Yeah.

708
00:39:52.690 --> 00:39:57.690
So Michael Cohen gets up and says that Trump is a bad character.

709
00:40:00.370 --> 00:40:04.900
And I'm like,
okay.
You know,
I mean,
this is,
this to me is not a surprise,

710
00:40:05.030 --> 00:40:08.200
but I don't think this is a big surprise.
Anyone why this is not,

711
00:40:08.260 --> 00:40:13.260
this is a guy that he's not the guy that you want your daughter to marry least.

712
00:40:13.390 --> 00:40:17.440
At least I don't want my daughters to marry someone like that.
Okay.

713
00:40:17.680 --> 00:40:22.180
So what's his character like?
Not the one that we want to model ourselves after.

714
00:40:23.170 --> 00:40:24.760
Do we want,
do we expect,

715
00:40:24.820 --> 00:40:28.330
do we want a leader to be someone that we can look up to and model ourselves

716
00:40:28.331 --> 00:40:33.100
after?
Absolutely.
Absolutely.
We want to look at a look at our leader and say,

717
00:40:33.250 --> 00:40:36.430
wow,
I really respect that person and I want to follow them.

718
00:40:36.431 --> 00:40:39.590
And I'm going to emulate their,
their actions and their behavior.
That's,

719
00:40:39.630 --> 00:40:43.750
that's absolutely,
that's what a leader is.
Yeah.
So does Trump fall short on that?

720
00:40:44.140 --> 00:40:48.280
Oh yes he does.
Yes he does.
So it's a,

721
00:40:48.340 --> 00:40:51.190
it's a strange world that we live in,

722
00:40:51.220 --> 00:40:56.140
that that guy versus Hillary Clinton who he ran against.

723
00:40:56.590 --> 00:41:00.550
Neither one of those people are people that,

724
00:41:01.420 --> 00:41:05.380
that you look at and say seems like a,
seems like a character I want to emulate.

725
00:41:05.381 --> 00:41:08.290
That's what I'm looking towards.
I want to be that person.
I want to,

726
00:41:08.350 --> 00:41:10.240
I want to move in that direction.
You know,

727
00:41:10.241 --> 00:41:12.760
from the 300 plus million people in America,

728
00:41:12.761 --> 00:41:16.930
those are the two candidates that we put forward.
What is wrong with us?
Yeah,

729
00:41:16.931 --> 00:41:18.550
that's a problem.
Well,
what is wrong with this?

730
00:41:18.600 --> 00:41:19.970
What do you think the answer to that is?

731
00:41:19.971 --> 00:41:23.080
Is that just the way the political system set up or is that the media or is that

732
00:41:23.081 --> 00:41:25.960
us is,
I think it all due to the political system for sure.

733
00:41:26.020 --> 00:41:28.180
I think it has to do with the,

734
00:41:28.240 --> 00:41:33.240
the way that the way that media is and the waste celebrity is that the is able

735
00:41:34.161 --> 00:41:37.760
to carry itself.
The character,
the Britain of self branding that goes out,

736
00:41:37.910 --> 00:41:40.850
I think drives so much of this that we're not really,

737
00:41:41.150 --> 00:41:45.320
we're not really assessing what type of leader this person is going to be.

738
00:41:45.440 --> 00:41:46.880
We're assessing how popular they are.

739
00:41:47.690 --> 00:41:50.780
So for a guy that talks about discipline a lot,
when you see Trump tweeting,

740
00:41:50.990 --> 00:41:52.970
is that what's going on in your head?
You're like,
man,

741
00:41:53.060 --> 00:41:54.590
this is just a discipline thing.

742
00:41:54.591 --> 00:41:58.160
Like you get some of these things right and if you could just discipline

743
00:41:58.161 --> 00:42:00.240
yourself in another way,
we can.

744
00:42:00.260 --> 00:42:05.260
I would say that I thought when when Trump won the election,

745
00:42:05.630 --> 00:42:09.050
and I was just as surprised as anyone when Trump won the election,
I thought,

746
00:42:09.051 --> 00:42:10.220
okay,
well you know what,

747
00:42:10.280 --> 00:42:13.160
at least now we're going to get to see him step up and act presidential,

748
00:42:13.161 --> 00:42:16.610
all that.
What did it take 15 minutes before he looked at it and said,
okay,

749
00:42:16.611 --> 00:42:20.430
I guess,
okay,
it's going to take him a little bit longer than I thought,
but,

750
00:42:20.440 --> 00:42:22.340
but it hasn't changed and it was the same thing.

751
00:42:22.490 --> 00:42:25.940
You'd see Hillary Clinton do the same types of things where you do doing

752
00:42:25.941 --> 00:42:29.510
behavior that you'd say to yourself,
why are you doing that?

753
00:42:30.100 --> 00:42:34.100
W W w.
W.
W you don't do that.
You don't do those kinds of things.

754
00:42:34.101 --> 00:42:36.740
You don't behave that way.
And so

755
00:42:38.450 --> 00:42:41.570
I think you just have to,
you know,
we have to kind of gut through.

756
00:42:41.571 --> 00:42:42.870
I hope that this is a,

757
00:42:43.180 --> 00:42:47.420
a situation where this is a a point,

758
00:42:48.020 --> 00:42:52.370
a pivot point for the country where we'll start looking around and saying,
okay,

759
00:42:52.371 --> 00:42:53.630
we only want to do that.

760
00:42:54.170 --> 00:42:57.410
We want to look for the right person that's going to do this job correctly.

761
00:42:57.411 --> 00:43:01.520
That's going to represent the country well and are you worried that we don't get

762
00:43:01.521 --> 00:43:02.180
out of this?

763
00:43:02.180 --> 00:43:06.020
Whatever this thing is that everyone can sort of feel and no one knows exactly

764
00:43:06.021 --> 00:43:08.210
what,
what it is.
Just this,

765
00:43:08.240 --> 00:43:11.720
this endless bickering and how it seems like social media is making us all hate

766
00:43:11.721 --> 00:43:14.300
each other and then we don't,
that we don't have real,

767
00:43:14.430 --> 00:43:16.610
at least at the political level,
leaders to look up to.

768
00:43:16.790 --> 00:43:21.080
If you're looking for self discipline and morality and whatever else,
you know,

769
00:43:21.081 --> 00:43:25.070
when people,
I had people right when Trump got elected,
you know,

770
00:43:25.280 --> 00:43:28.550
people would just fly off the handle with me.
Right?

771
00:43:28.620 --> 00:43:31.430
And I don't really talk about politics very often.

772
00:43:31.490 --> 00:43:36.410
And the reason that I don't talk about politics very often is because,
well,

773
00:43:36.411 --> 00:43:41.330
because from a leadership perspective,
if I'm trying to get you to do something,

774
00:43:41.870 --> 00:43:44.570
the worst way to lead is for me to bark at you and tell you what to do.

775
00:43:44.930 --> 00:43:46.010
That's not good leadership.

776
00:43:46.040 --> 00:43:50.690
So I don't do that with people that I communicate with.
I don't say,
Hey,
he's,

777
00:43:50.720 --> 00:43:53.330
he's horrible and she's great,
or she's horrible.
And he's going,
oh,

778
00:43:53.420 --> 00:43:54.860
I don't say that.
I just,

779
00:43:55.640 --> 00:44:00.640
I just give examples from history about the way good leaders behave and the way

780
00:44:01.311 --> 00:44:03.530
badly,
because we haven't let people make their own decisions.

781
00:44:04.070 --> 00:44:08.120
But somebody was hitting me up,
hey,
you know,
you need to,

782
00:44:08.121 --> 00:44:11.690
you need to speak out.
And you know,
I said,
okay,
well here's my speech.

783
00:44:12.350 --> 00:44:16.700
American is stronger than one man.
America is stronger than one man.

784
00:44:17.080 --> 00:44:21.870
America is stronger than any one individual politician.
We're,

785
00:44:22.340 --> 00:44:25.460
we're a massive,
you know,
massive ship.

786
00:44:25.461 --> 00:44:27.230
And a massive ship takes a long time to turn.

787
00:44:27.260 --> 00:44:29.990
And the checks and balances that are in place inside the government,

788
00:44:30.020 --> 00:44:31.260
which are sometimes really,

789
00:44:31.860 --> 00:44:36.860
really bureaucratic and disappointing and aggravating because it's so hard to

790
00:44:36.871 --> 00:44:39.180
change things.
They're,
they're hard to change for a reason.

791
00:44:39.750 --> 00:44:44.700
So am I worried that this is at this tipping point won't come?
No.

792
00:44:44.730 --> 00:44:49.260
It'll come eventually because eventually free people,

793
00:44:49.770 --> 00:44:53.910
the free people of America won't allow for things to go so far in one direction

794
00:44:53.911 --> 00:44:57.630
or so far in the other direction.
We won't allow it now.

795
00:44:57.990 --> 00:45:01.740
What makes it hard to reach that tipping point is because America,
it's so,

796
00:45:02.550 --> 00:45:06.180
it's so beautiful in America,
right?
There's,
there's,
it's such a stress free life,

797
00:45:06.181 --> 00:45:08.670
right?
It's just there's,
you know,

798
00:45:08.671 --> 00:45:13.671
we were in the middle of two wars and that didn't affect the average American in

799
00:45:15.541 --> 00:45:19.470
any way whatsoever.
That not even the oil prices,
like nothing affected them.

800
00:45:19.620 --> 00:45:24.270
They were still driving their SUV to Starbucks and ordering a Latte with zero

801
00:45:24.271 --> 00:45:24.900
impact.

802
00:45:24.900 --> 00:45:28.410
And that was when we were fighting two wars and lead losing people every day on

803
00:45:28.411 --> 00:45:30.360
those battlefields.
It was no factor.

804
00:45:30.870 --> 00:45:34.360
So what happens in Americas,
we,
we're,

805
00:45:34.410 --> 00:45:37.920
we pretty much don't care as long as we're comfortable,

806
00:45:38.340 --> 00:45:41.780
but if things start to get uncomfortable,
that's when I think the,

807
00:45:41.840 --> 00:45:45.930
the real tipping point will come and there'll be a backlash one way or the
other.

808
00:45:46.110 --> 00:45:48.510
Yeah.
All right.
I want to shift off some of the worst stuff,
but very quickly.

809
00:45:48.510 --> 00:45:50.040
So since you mentioned the two wars,

810
00:45:50.250 --> 00:45:53.610
the one that nobody ever talks about or even thinks about is Afghanistan,

811
00:45:53.611 --> 00:45:56.790
which I think now it's the,
it's the longest war we've ever been in,
right?
I mean,

812
00:45:56.791 --> 00:45:59.880
this is the longest war.
It's still ongoing now.

813
00:45:59.881 --> 00:46:03.910
It seems to me that nobody knows really why we're there or why this is so a and

814
00:46:03.920 --> 00:46:04.141
going,

815
00:46:04.141 --> 00:46:08.450
what the hell should we be doing or thinking about or we don't even need to say

816
00:46:08.451 --> 00:46:10.680
it's never discussed the period.
Yeah,

817
00:46:10.681 --> 00:46:14.220
and it's interesting because this is something when when Trump,

818
00:46:14.430 --> 00:46:16.440
if you remember Trump said,
hey,
what's the plan?

819
00:46:17.130 --> 00:46:20.740
And you got a bunch of pushback and people were saying,
Oh,
who's he to ask?

820
00:46:20.850 --> 00:46:24.510
And I was like,
well,
he's the president.
And so yeah,
you need some kind of a plan.

821
00:46:24.511 --> 00:46:25.970
You need some kind of a goal.
And I,

822
00:46:25.971 --> 00:46:30.420
I do think that needs clear definition in Afghanistan of what it is we're trying

823
00:46:30.421 --> 00:46:35.310
to make happen.
What does that look like?
You know,

824
00:46:35.311 --> 00:46:37.380
from my perspective,

825
00:46:37.530 --> 00:46:42.000
when you get into these countries where you're trying to build something,

826
00:46:42.001 --> 00:46:42.810
we're trying to,

827
00:46:42.810 --> 00:46:45.870
you're not trying to build yourself and trying to allow them to be free.

828
00:46:46.160 --> 00:46:48.450
That's what you're really trying to make happen.

829
00:46:48.870 --> 00:46:51.060
You're trying to allow these countries to be free.

830
00:46:51.061 --> 00:46:52.590
They're not going to be the same as us.

831
00:46:52.620 --> 00:46:55.560
That's one thing that I'm fairly confident about.

832
00:46:55.770 --> 00:47:00.420
There's different cultures that are going to adopt freedom and democracy in a

833
00:47:00.421 --> 00:47:05.421
different way and you can't impose what we think it should be like on other

834
00:47:06.841 --> 00:47:09.090
cultures because it doesn't match up perfectly,

835
00:47:09.630 --> 00:47:14.630
but it can match up pretty well and individual human beings in these countries,

836
00:47:16.620 --> 00:47:21.150
you know what they want,
they want a job,
they want to build a little business.

837
00:47:21.510 --> 00:47:23.310
They want to be able to feed their kids.

838
00:47:23.370 --> 00:47:25.590
They want their kids to have a better opportunity than they do.

839
00:47:26.640 --> 00:47:30.340
That's what when you can,
when you can provide some of that,

840
00:47:31.480 --> 00:47:34.660
that will start to take hold and when you provide some of it,

841
00:47:34.870 --> 00:47:38.200
other people in that country will look at it goes,
hmm,

842
00:47:38.680 --> 00:47:41.380
that seems to be a pretty good deal over there.

843
00:47:41.620 --> 00:47:46.620
I would like to try that too and pretty soon you can get freedom and democracy,

844
00:47:46.721 --> 00:47:51.700
the attitude of it too to expand and so it takes a long time.
You know,

845
00:47:51.701 --> 00:47:55.270
the average counter insurgency is seven years,
but they can take really,

846
00:47:55.271 --> 00:47:57.070
really long time.
But

847
00:47:58.990 --> 00:48:03.990
in my opinion and really through the history of the world,

848
00:48:05.860 --> 00:48:09.580
eventually in my mind eventually had through history.

849
00:48:09.970 --> 00:48:14.970
Eventually the free individual will rise to the top and and rule and and they

850
00:48:18.371 --> 00:48:19.510
will rule themselves.

851
00:48:19.900 --> 00:48:24.900
And so you have to give that opportunity for individual freedom.

852
00:48:25.720 --> 00:48:29.020
You,
they have to have the opportunity to grow and to take root,

853
00:48:29.610 --> 00:48:34.150
take good solid root and to grow and be strong enough that when tyranny comes

854
00:48:34.151 --> 00:48:34.984
along,

855
00:48:35.140 --> 00:48:39.400
it can't just wipe it out because tierny can wipe out the individuals without

856
00:48:39.420 --> 00:48:39.670
climbing.

857
00:48:39.670 --> 00:48:43.750
We've seen that and history to tyranny can wipe out and destroy individual

858
00:48:43.751 --> 00:48:47.410
freedoms and individual really individual aspirations.

859
00:48:47.440 --> 00:48:50.890
They can just be mopped up and destroyed by a tyranny.
Tyranny.

860
00:48:51.100 --> 00:48:54.190
So you have to give freedom and individual freedom,

861
00:48:54.760 --> 00:48:57.190
not just the time to sprout up a little bit.

862
00:48:57.520 --> 00:49:02.520
You got to give it the time to take root because once people have tasted true

863
00:49:03.101 --> 00:49:07.000
freedom and true opportunity,
they don't give it up.

864
00:49:07.600 --> 00:49:09.550
And that's what I think you have to do.

865
00:49:09.551 --> 00:49:14.080
You have to stay somewhere long enough that people understand what true freedom

866
00:49:14.081 --> 00:49:14.740
is.

867
00:49:14.740 --> 00:49:19.450
They recognize that it's there is to protect and it has to be rooted strong

868
00:49:19.451 --> 00:49:22.660
enough that it can't be white washed away by tyranny.

869
00:49:23.800 --> 00:49:27.520
So then going all the way back.
So what are we doing in Afghanistan?
I mean,

870
00:49:27.521 --> 00:49:29.440
do you sense that that's actually happening there?

871
00:49:29.620 --> 00:49:33.250
Cause it's like something like 14 years or something and it's one of these

872
00:49:33.251 --> 00:49:38.251
things where we oscillate too much on what it is that we're trying to accomplish

873
00:49:40.151 --> 00:49:43.210
and what we're willing to sacrifice to accomplish it.
Because you know,

874
00:49:43.211 --> 00:49:47.500
from an isolationist perspective,
from a,
from a,
okay,

875
00:49:47.501 --> 00:49:52.210
let's just take of America,
take care of America.
Oh,
let's take the Taliban.

876
00:49:52.211 --> 00:49:56.650
Oh you want to live in like a world you want your country to be,
you know,

877
00:49:56.800 --> 00:49:59.920
back in the stone age and that's how you want to live.
Okay,
cool.

878
00:49:59.950 --> 00:50:03.090
We'll be over here doing our thing.
Like that's,
that's,
yeah,
that's,
that's,

879
00:50:03.230 --> 00:50:08.110
that's a legitimate plan.
Hey,
you guys want to live in the stone age?

880
00:50:08.770 --> 00:50:12.670
Cool.
We'll be over here with iPhones.
That's fine.
We don't care.

881
00:50:13.180 --> 00:50:15.810
But then it's like,
okay,
but we're going to breathe terrorists,
but okay,
we'll,

882
00:50:15.811 --> 00:50:19.030
we'll comment on a case me and knock those guys out.
How's that?
Okay,

883
00:50:19.200 --> 00:50:23.890
we could do that.
And that's if that's the plan.
Okay,
let that be the plan.

884
00:50:24.130 --> 00:50:25.120
But if we're going to stay there,

885
00:50:25.420 --> 00:50:26.920
if we're going to try and get freedom to take root,

886
00:50:26.980 --> 00:50:30.830
which I believe is the best thing to do because I do believe that we do have

887
00:50:30.890 --> 00:50:35.890
some level of moral obligation to try and support individual freedom throughout

888
00:50:36.681 --> 00:50:41.030
the world.
That's,
that's to me,
that's pretty self evident.

889
00:50:41.330 --> 00:50:44.060
Does that mean that we have to jump in everywhere,
that there's oppression?
No,

890
00:50:44.061 --> 00:50:44.894
it doesn't and we can't.

891
00:50:45.530 --> 00:50:50.270
And it also means that inside those countries,

892
00:50:51.050 --> 00:50:56.050
the human beings inside those countries also has a moral obligation to rise up

893
00:50:56.150 --> 00:51:00.980
and fight on their own.
And that was nice about going back to Iraq was,
you know,

894
00:51:00.981 --> 00:51:04.310
I've got friends that fought in Mozel as I took Mozal back,

895
00:51:04.311 --> 00:51:07.970
but those weren't Iraqi troops that were moving from building to building,

896
00:51:08.150 --> 00:51:10.910
taking massive casualties.
As a matter of fact,

897
00:51:11.150 --> 00:51:13.250
one of my friends that was there said,

898
00:51:13.670 --> 00:51:16.490
there was like in the beginning of the Mozal campaign,

899
00:51:17.900 --> 00:51:20.180
the Americans were looking at each other saying,
hey,

900
00:51:20.480 --> 00:51:21.860
these guys are taking so many casualties,

901
00:51:21.861 --> 00:51:24.740
we're going to run out of Iraqi soldiers.
Like they're all going to die.

902
00:51:25.160 --> 00:51:29.570
And the Iraqi soldiers continued to go forward and they continue to fight it in.

903
00:51:29.570 --> 00:51:32.020
They ended up,
you know,
getting the upper hand.
And so when they say that,

904
00:51:32.021 --> 00:51:36.620
that we were greeted as liberator's,
it actually is true.
Oh yeah,
yeah.

905
00:51:36.890 --> 00:51:40.940
Oh my God.
I mean in Mozel.
Oh,
it was,
and again,

906
00:51:40.941 --> 00:51:43.160
I wasn't there and I never fought in Afghanistan either.

907
00:51:43.400 --> 00:51:47.870
But the guys coming back from Bozel,
those are the people were absolutely just,

908
00:51:47.930 --> 00:51:49.190
they were,
they were,

909
00:51:50.240 --> 00:51:55.010
they were being everything enslaved,
beheaded,
tortured,
everything.

910
00:51:55.040 --> 00:51:59.000
It was absolutely,
it was heinous.
Yeah,
it was.
It was a,
it was a heinous war.

911
00:51:59.001 --> 00:52:02.480
Crime across the board.
So,
yeah,
absolutely.
So we are,

912
00:52:02.510 --> 00:52:05.300
we've done a lot sort of out of our borders here,

913
00:52:05.301 --> 00:52:06.930
but it's interesting you mentioned that,
you know,

914
00:52:07.220 --> 00:52:10.480
we can be in the middle of all of these words and yet we can still get a latte

915
00:52:10.490 --> 00:52:12.860
and we can still pay no attention to it and live our good lies.

916
00:52:13.160 --> 00:52:16.520
Do you think there's a risk to our freedom here because of that?

917
00:52:16.790 --> 00:52:21.790
That we've got it so freaking good that we almost don't know what freedom is

918
00:52:22.101 --> 00:52:22.934
anymore?

919
00:52:27.530 --> 00:52:31.900
Do I think it's an actual risk?
No,
no,

920
00:52:32.210 --> 00:52:33.080
no,
I don't.

921
00:52:33.560 --> 00:52:37.910
I think that the minute things,

922
00:52:37.940 --> 00:52:42.710
the minute you start really talking about taking away the personal freedoms of

923
00:52:42.711 --> 00:52:47.690
Americans,
there will be real problems.
So,
okay.
Is that a risk?
Sure.

924
00:52:47.691 --> 00:52:48.710
That could.
That could be a risk.

925
00:52:48.950 --> 00:52:53.950
I see that as a real small chance that things get bad enough where where mass

926
00:52:56.751 --> 00:52:59.180
groups of Americans say,
Oh yeah,
we're not,
we're not.
We're not.

927
00:52:59.420 --> 00:53:03.680
We're not doing that.
You just crossed the line.
You know the American revolution,

928
00:53:03.710 --> 00:53:06.410
right?
Oh,
you want to raise the taxes now?

929
00:53:06.411 --> 00:53:07.850
Actually we're going to fight a war against you.

930
00:53:07.851 --> 00:53:11.060
You're not raising the tea taxes,
right.
That's,
could it get to that point here?

931
00:53:11.420 --> 00:53:15.650
Sure.
But you've got to remember what's going to be sacrificed.
And you know,

932
00:53:15.680 --> 00:53:17.690
that's one of the coolest things about the American revolution is the people

933
00:53:17.691 --> 00:53:21.080
that fought it with the people that actually had the most to lose the people

934
00:53:21.081 --> 00:53:24.500
that stood up.
So it would take,
it would take a lot,
but,
um,
I don't,

935
00:53:26.700 --> 00:53:28.290
I think you would take a lot to get there.

936
00:53:28.860 --> 00:53:33.500
I think it would take a while to get there and if it gets there,
that'd be sad.

937
00:53:33.770 --> 00:53:38.690
It'll be a sad day.
But I believe that freedom would prevail.
All right,

938
00:53:38.691 --> 00:53:42.500
let's,
let's shift all together to sort of what you're doing now.
So podcasting,

939
00:53:42.501 --> 00:53:45.860
writing,
all that stuff,
having these kinds of conversations.
Um,

940
00:53:45.950 --> 00:53:49.250
it's Kinda cool that,
that people are paying attention to this stuff now,

941
00:53:49.251 --> 00:53:52.010
isn't it?
When you started doing the podcast,
was that just sort of,

942
00:53:52.011 --> 00:53:55.160
you were just going to throw it out there and see what happens and see if,

943
00:53:55.280 --> 00:53:58.410
oh wow.
People might want to listen to a long form conversation.
Yeah.

944
00:53:58.610 --> 00:54:03.080
I did a podcast with Tim Ferriss.
And when he press stop on the recorder,

945
00:54:03.081 --> 00:54:04.280
he said you should do your own podcast.

946
00:54:04.280 --> 00:54:06.410
And then Joe Rogan heard it inviting me on.

947
00:54:06.411 --> 00:54:08.630
So it was on Joe Rogan's podcast in the middle of that podcast or rockets.

948
00:54:08.660 --> 00:54:09.650
And you should have your own podcast.

949
00:54:09.651 --> 00:54:12.990
So when Tim Ferriss and Joe Rogan tell you to have a podcast to have a podcast,

950
00:54:12.991 --> 00:54:17.430
you listened.
So I did.
And for me it's a,
it's a,

951
00:54:17.610 --> 00:54:22.110
it's a great medium.
I always,
when I grew up,
I grew up listening to radio shows.

952
00:54:22.200 --> 00:54:23.033
And so

953
00:54:24.800 --> 00:54:29.690
I always liked listening to radio.
And that's essentially what it is,

954
00:54:29.691 --> 00:54:32.690
is radio without commercials.
And

955
00:54:34.190 --> 00:54:38.710
I get to talk about things that I'm interested in.
And,
and again,
you know,
the,

956
00:54:38.711 --> 00:54:41.410
the advice,
some of the advice that I got when I started off was like,
oh,

957
00:54:41.411 --> 00:54:44.200
you need to have guests all the time.
People are getting tired of,
you don't,

958
00:54:44.380 --> 00:54:46.630
don't talk about these dark,
you know,

959
00:54:46.631 --> 00:54:48.670
don't talk about these dark violent things all,

960
00:54:48.671 --> 00:54:51.730
you can't talk about war all the time and you need to keep them shorter.

961
00:54:51.730 --> 00:54:55.480
And all this and I didn't listen to anybody and my podcasts are really long.

962
00:54:55.570 --> 00:54:59.620
Some of them are extremely heavy and dark and talk about some of the worst.

963
00:55:00.700 --> 00:55:00.971
In fact,

964
00:55:00.971 --> 00:55:05.260
I think we've covered most of the really the worst things that have unfolded on

965
00:55:05.261 --> 00:55:09.940
the planet and they're long.
And I,
and I don't have a lot of guests,
you know,

966
00:55:09.941 --> 00:55:11.680
I do have guests but I don't have a lot of guests.

967
00:55:11.860 --> 00:55:16.750
So the interesting thing is yes,
shockingly enough people,

968
00:55:16.751 --> 00:55:21.520
people listen to it and the connection and the feedback is,
is awesome.

969
00:55:21.610 --> 00:55:25.520
Yeah.
How do you think it's changed you by going into all those dark places and

970
00:55:25.521 --> 00:55:29.120
talking about all this stuff and,
and expressing your ideas and all that?

971
00:55:30.440 --> 00:55:32.450
Well,
I've gotten,
I've,
I've gotten a lot,

972
00:55:33.470 --> 00:55:38.180
I've gotten a lot of experience out of it.
The experience I get out of it as I,

973
00:55:38.210 --> 00:55:40.880
so I do a lot of book,
I covered a lot of historical books.
Like I said,

974
00:55:40.881 --> 00:55:44.840
first person,
accounts of war and atrocity in that.

975
00:55:46.370 --> 00:55:49.220
When I first started the podcast,
I say,
well,
you know,
I probably got,

976
00:55:49.370 --> 00:55:53.180
I'll probably do five cause I got like five books that really had an impact on

977
00:55:53.181 --> 00:55:57.980
me.
So I'll cover those books and then oh whatever.
That'll probably be it.

978
00:55:58.820 --> 00:55:59.990
And then I said,
you know,

979
00:56:00.530 --> 00:56:03.110
there was one more book that I really want to throw in this pile.

980
00:56:03.860 --> 00:56:06.980
And then there was another one and it didn't take,
but you know,

981
00:56:07.820 --> 00:56:11.900
five or six more podcasts where I said I'm never going to be able to do the pod

982
00:56:11.960 --> 00:56:13.970
enough podcast to cover the things that I want to talk about.

983
00:56:14.870 --> 00:56:16.940
And that's the way it's been.
So I've read,

984
00:56:17.870 --> 00:56:22.870
I read basically a book a week for the last three years and you know,

985
00:56:23.831 --> 00:56:25.700
I,
I finished doing all the books that I,

986
00:56:25.980 --> 00:56:30.460
that I actually hadn't already read in like,
I dunno.

987
00:56:30.550 --> 00:56:32.650
So you're like,
I better write some then.
Yeah.

988
00:56:32.651 --> 00:56:36.520
Well I'd already written my first book when the podcast came out.
[inaudible] so,

989
00:56:37.870 --> 00:56:39.490
so how has it changed me and the other,

990
00:56:39.520 --> 00:56:44.520
the other great thing is I get to interact with all these people and people come

991
00:56:46.121 --> 00:56:50.650
up and I know they do this to you.
Two people come up to me and they say,
I know,

992
00:56:50.700 --> 00:56:54.220
I feel like I know it's weird but I feel like you know me.
And I'm like,
yeah,

993
00:56:54.820 --> 00:56:58.960
you do know me.
Because how I am on the podcast is actually how I am.

994
00:56:58.961 --> 00:57:00.670
That's just me.
And,

995
00:57:00.720 --> 00:57:03.190
and then I tell them that I actually know them too because if they've listened

996
00:57:03.191 --> 00:57:08.110
to me for 500 hours,
you haven't spent 500 hours listening to wife,

997
00:57:08.950 --> 00:57:10.840
you know what I mean?
It's like that's just not happening.

998
00:57:11.320 --> 00:57:15.580
So I do know them and then they gave great feedback and I learned a lot from,

999
00:57:16.480 --> 00:57:17.620
from the books that I read,

1000
00:57:17.621 --> 00:57:22.120
from the people that I have had on and from the feedback that I get.
And Hey,

1001
00:57:22.121 --> 00:57:25.420
read this book,
look at this aspect.
So it's made me,

1002
00:57:25.510 --> 00:57:27.700
it's made me learn a lot.

1003
00:57:27.970 --> 00:57:31.270
So from first person or books and all your life experience,

1004
00:57:31.271 --> 00:57:36.260
how do we end up with,
we got two of them here,
I think.
Children's books.
Yeah,

1005
00:57:36.261 --> 00:57:40.650
yeah,
yeah.
Right here.
Well,
so there's the Dragon Dragon,

1006
00:57:40.651 --> 00:57:44.950
so yeah.
Yeah.
I didn't,
I didn't write,

1007
00:57:46.300 --> 00:57:49.420
I didn't,
I didn't,
I didn't give Jordan any credit for it.

1008
00:57:50.410 --> 00:57:53.490
It's called Mike and the dragons.
Jordan.
Sorry.
Yeah.
Um,

1009
00:57:54.610 --> 00:57:59.140
I've got four kids and as I started

1010
00:58:01.060 --> 00:58:04.900
continuing to hear back from people that were listening to what I was saying,

1011
00:58:04.930 --> 00:58:08.410
and the,
what I hear a lot is,
I wish I had this when I was a kid.

1012
00:58:08.411 --> 00:58:11.620
I wish I had this when I was a kid.
And of course my answer would be like,

1013
00:58:11.650 --> 00:58:14.860
I do too.
I wish I had the lessons from extreme ownership when I was a kid.

1014
00:58:15.280 --> 00:58:17.860
I wish I had the lessons from the discipline and goes freedom field manual,

1015
00:58:17.861 --> 00:58:22.510
and I was a kid.
Absolutely.
And grown up or watching my own children grow up.

1016
00:58:22.810 --> 00:58:27.430
I just knew that the things that I tried to impart on them,

1017
00:58:28.150 --> 00:58:33.150
I figured I could put into stories where I could impart those values onto little

1018
00:58:35.081 --> 00:58:39.820
kits and make their lives easier and better.
And that's it.

1019
00:58:39.821 --> 00:58:44.650
So I started writing them and it was
surprising at,

1020
00:58:44.651 --> 00:58:48.340
at the,
the response,
the response has been,
you know,
people love them.

1021
00:58:48.400 --> 00:58:49.330
And you know,

1022
00:58:49.331 --> 00:58:54.010
one of my favorite letters I've gotten is I got this letter from this guy who,

1023
00:58:54.160 --> 00:58:54.341
you know,

1024
00:58:54.341 --> 00:58:58.870
he's saying I'm 37 years old and I was drinking and I was overweight and I was

1025
00:58:58.871 --> 00:59:01.510
doing it,
hadn't been promoted.
And I got all these problems going on in his life.

1026
00:59:01.511 --> 00:59:03.200
And he said,
and I read your book.
And I said,
okay,

1027
00:59:03.201 --> 00:59:05.170
I'm going to wake up a little early.
Okay,
I'm gonna start working out.
Okay,

1028
00:59:05.171 --> 00:59:06.400
I'm going to stop complaining.
Okay.

1029
00:59:06.640 --> 00:59:10.930
And he went through his whole letter and how now he had lost 52 pounds and he

1030
00:59:10.931 --> 00:59:13.600
had been promoted and he had stopped drinking and all this stuff.

1031
00:59:13.601 --> 00:59:16.840
And then the last line said,
the book I read was the way of the warrior kid,

1032
00:59:17.200 --> 00:59:19.180
which is know aimed at kids,

1033
00:59:19.181 --> 00:59:24.181
but the lessons in there are completely universal and apply to your whole life.

1034
00:59:24.380 --> 00:59:26.900
So it's been,
it's been great.

1035
00:59:26.901 --> 00:59:31.901
And I get a lot of social media posts of little kids studying flashcards because

1036
00:59:32.570 --> 00:59:36.320
the premise of the warrior kid story is that there's a little kid who's,

1037
00:59:37.310 --> 00:59:40.250
he can't do any pull ups,
he doesn't know how to swim.

1038
00:59:40.550 --> 00:59:45.550
He's getting picked on by the school bully Kenny Williamson and he doesn't know

1039
00:59:46.611 --> 00:59:49.910
his times tables and the last day of school ends and he's all sad.

1040
00:59:49.970 --> 00:59:50.391
And then you remember,

1041
00:59:50.391 --> 00:59:54.860
remembers that his uncle Jake is coming to stay with him for the summer and his

1042
00:59:54.861 --> 00:59:56.330
uncle Jake was in the seal teams.

1043
00:59:56.630 --> 00:59:59.840
So was uncle Jay comes to stay and the first day he says,
Hey,
you know,

1044
01:00:00.110 --> 01:00:02.780
what do you want to do tomorrow and do something?
You want to go for a swim?

1045
01:00:02.920 --> 01:00:06.550
Nikki goes a little notice the way and I don't know how to goes,
you know,

1046
01:00:06.560 --> 01:00:08.690
don't know my times tables getting picked on.
So the uncle says,
look,

1047
01:00:08.691 --> 01:00:12.050
these are problems we can solve.
All these gets them into Jujitsu classes,

1048
01:00:12.051 --> 01:00:12.801
teach them how to swim,

1049
01:00:12.801 --> 01:00:15.950
teaching them how to study using flashcards and other memorization techniques

1050
01:00:16.490 --> 01:00:21.110
and teaching them how to eat right,
teaches them to work out and the kid turns,

1051
01:00:21.170 --> 01:00:23.610
turns around.
And so that's that one,
Mikey,

1052
01:00:23.660 --> 01:00:28.660
the dragons is about facing your dragons and little kid that's scared of

1053
01:00:28.671 --> 01:00:33.671
everything and he finds a book under his bed and it's the opens it up quickly

1054
01:00:33.951 --> 01:00:37.550
and there's a bunch of pictures in it that looks scary of dragons and fire.

1055
01:00:37.550 --> 01:00:38.900
And so he's doesn't want to read it.

1056
01:00:38.901 --> 01:00:42.110
But there's also a picture in there of a little kid that looks confident and

1057
01:00:42.111 --> 01:00:44.840
like he knows what he's doing.
So he says,
all right,
you know what?

1058
01:00:44.841 --> 01:00:45.740
I'm going to read this book.

1059
01:00:45.920 --> 01:00:50.240
And then you turn the page in this book and you are now looking at the cover of

1060
01:00:50.241 --> 01:00:52.430
this next book,
which is called the dragon prince.

1061
01:00:52.550 --> 01:00:57.200
And that's the story of a kingdom where the king had died.

1062
01:00:58.070 --> 01:01:01.910
And now there was no one to defend the kingdom from the dragons except for this

1063
01:01:01.911 --> 01:01:04.970
little seven year old prints.
And so he's scared.

1064
01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:09.110
He goes to get his father's sword in his father sealed to opens up this big war

1065
01:01:09.111 --> 01:01:13.140
chest.
And in there he pulls out the store,
gets too heavy for him.

1066
01:01:13.170 --> 01:01:14.570
He pulls out the shield and it's too heavy for him.

1067
01:01:14.571 --> 01:01:16.430
And he's even more scared now.

1068
01:01:16.550 --> 01:01:20.270
And then he sees a note at the bottom of the war chest and he pulls it out and

1069
01:01:20.271 --> 01:01:21.350
it's a note from his father,

1070
01:01:21.351 --> 01:01:25.940
the king who explains to him what he needs to do to stand up and face the

1071
01:01:25.941 --> 01:01:30.890
dragons.
And the story continues on.
So I enjoy storytelling.
Yeah.

1072
01:01:30.891 --> 01:01:32.990
Well,
I sent,
I sent an animated movie,

1073
01:01:32.991 --> 01:01:37.160
and I guess the last thing I got for you is what do you do to relax after all

1074
01:01:37.161 --> 01:01:38.930
this,
after all the work and everything else,

1075
01:01:38.931 --> 01:01:40.760
and it's a pretty intense life that you're living.

1076
01:01:40.940 --> 01:01:43.850
I'm guessing you're gonna say working out,
but give me something off.
Well,
work.

1077
01:01:43.851 --> 01:01:48.050
Does that include Jujitsu?
Yeah.
Well,
that's still within the working out thing,

1078
01:01:48.080 --> 01:01:50.990
but whatever works for you.
That's,
you know what?
I surf,
I do Jujitsu.

1079
01:01:51.140 --> 01:01:56.120
I hang out with my kids,
play guitar,
and
yeah,

1080
01:01:56.121 --> 01:01:59.390
I find this stuff relaxing.
It's enjoyable for me to to write.

1081
01:01:59.420 --> 01:02:03.800
It's enjoyable for me to talk to people about leadership and go out with my

1082
01:02:04.220 --> 01:02:09.220
company Exelon front and teach and align executives on leadership and watch them

1083
01:02:12.170 --> 01:02:16.280
be able to turn their company around or bring their company to the next level

1084
01:02:16.430 --> 01:02:19.920
based 100% on leadership,
which is what I tell them.
I say,
look,

1085
01:02:19.921 --> 01:02:21.990
you've got this problem.
You've got that problem.
You've got another problem.

1086
01:02:22.380 --> 01:02:26.100
Every problem that you have inside your organization is leadership problem.

1087
01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.210
I guess that means you slayed the dragon and you're,

1088
01:02:29.211 --> 01:02:31.200
you're doing the right thing in life.
It's been a pleasure,
man.

1089
01:02:31.230 --> 01:02:34.020
