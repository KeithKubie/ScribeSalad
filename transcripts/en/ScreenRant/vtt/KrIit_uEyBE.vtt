00:00:07.029 --> 00:00:11.240
Superman is one of the most iconic fictional
characters in popular culture and he tends

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:13.560
to come out on top in most of his battles.

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:17.950
He's had some memorable fights against villains
and fellow heroes alike, and boasts victories

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:22.000
against equally iconic good guys like Thor,
Hulk and He-Man.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.930
His most memorable defeats have come against
villains.

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.590
The likes of Doomsday, Darkseid and even The
Joker can lay claim to having beaten the Man

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:33.010
of Steel - but several heroes have actually
gotten the better of him too.

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:36.980
In this video, we'll take a look at just some
of the heroic characters who have done so.

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:42.079
Here are ten powerful superheroes who have
beaten Superman.

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:44.610
Batman
In spite of the fact that Batman is a fellow

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.899
superhero and indeed a good friend to Superman,
he has actually gone up against the Man of

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.339
Steel almost as many times as any villain
- this year's Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice

00:00:53.339 --> 00:00:57.550
movie is testament to that - and, in spite
of the fact that he is infinitely less powerful

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:02.050
than the Man of Steel, the Dark Knight has
gotten the better of him many times.Batman's

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:05.740
victories usually come courtesy of Kryptonite
- Superman's weakness.

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:10.720
In fact, Bats was actually given some of the
green stuff by Supes as a contingency in case

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:14.610
the Kryptonian hero ever went rogue - and
whenever Batman has felt the need to take

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.390
him down, he has used it with great success
against him.

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.600
Captain Marvel
Although it's not a specific weakness of his

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.710
as some people would have you believe, Superman
is as vulnerable to magic as any normal person.

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:31.439
So, bearing that in mind, the fact that Captain
Marvel - who is every bit as strong, fast

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:35.469
and durable as the Man of Steel - obtained
his powers from a magical source in the form

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:39.579
of the wizard Shazam, it's no wonder that
he has overcome the Kryptonian on a number

00:01:39.579 --> 00:01:44.159
of occasions.The two heroes have fought many
times across various forms of media - and

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:49.220
Superman has actually won a lot of those bouts
- but Captain Marvel's magical edge has allowed

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:53.869
him to knock Supes out with basic physical
attacks and take him out with magical lightning

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:58.240
just as many times as he's been defeated.

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:01.179
Green Lantern
Obviously, the title of "Green Lantern" isn't

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:05.409
specific to a single character, but if comic
book history has proved anything, it's that

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:09.940
any given Green Lantern could defeat Superman
if the opportunity arose - because their rings

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:13.660
have been known to create a synthetic form
of Kryptonite, Superman's weakness.This first

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:14.660
became apparent in DC Comics Presents #26,
when a villain posing as Hal Jordan discovered

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:15.660
it was the case - but Jordan later found another
way to defeat the Man of Steel.

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.840
Jordan bonded with the cosmic fear entity
known as Parallax in Zero Hour #1 and took

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.319
Superman out with ease.

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:25.530
Wonder Woman
As one of DC's "Big Three", Wonder Woman is

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:30.560
a very popular character - but she doesn't
get the same respect as Superman and Batman.

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.840
And, as a general rule, when she goes up against
the Man of Steel in combat, he tends to get

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:39.099
the better of her - but there was a particular
occasion where that wasn't the case.It was

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:43.620
during the Infinite Crisis arc, but there
was a catch; the Superman that Wondy got the

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.900
better of was being mind-controlled by Maxwell
Lord - but that doesn't change the fact that

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.370
she did indeed briefly take him down.

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:53.510
She did so by slitting his throat using her
tiara.

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:57.480
And it's not as if Superman wasn't trying
- he had been influenced into believing that

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.650
Wonder Woman was Doomsday!

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.120
Hawkman
Sometimes it takes a plot device even more

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:07.520
wacky than Kryptonite to take out the Man
of Steel - and, fortunately for Hawkman, he

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:10.120
possesses one in the form of the Claw of Horus.

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:14.939
It's a weapon that was forged in ancient Egypt
using Nth metal and it draws its power from

00:03:14.939 --> 00:03:19.590
the magnetic core of the Earth - and Hawkman
used it to knock out Superman.It happened

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:24.420
in Superman-Batman Book 1: "Public Enemies",
when the two got into an altercation, and

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:29.010
Hawkman ended the exchange by hitting Supes
with the Claw of Horus and saying "essentially,

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:35.000
I just hit you with the planet," which is
a pretty damn awesome line in anyone's book.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.489
Orion
Orion is unique on this list, as he's the

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:42.480
only character on it to defeat Superman with
a single blow - that's right, this guy one-punched

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:43.550
the Man of Steel.

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:48.350
It happened in the New 52 timeline - a timeline
in which the pair generally fight quite evenly

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:52.920
when they face each other - in Superman #20,
when Orion did indeed managed to deliver a

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:57.599
single punch that put Superman down.The son
of Darkseid - one of Superman's most fearsome

00:03:57.599 --> 00:04:02.130
enemies - Orion possesses incredible super-strength
that is on a par with the Kryptonian hero,

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:05.640
and it's augmented by advanced technology
such as the Asto-Harness.

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:09.409
He really isn't to be messed with.

00:04:09.409 --> 00:04:11.599
Lobo
Lobo is one of the most bad-ass characters

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:16.690
in comic books and, as an intergalactic bounty
hunter, has made Superman a target on a number

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:17.820
of occasions.

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:21.989
And he's actually come out on top on more
than one of those occasions.A prime example

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:26.229
would be their first ever encounter, in the
Superman: Eradication storyline, when Lobo

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:30.110
was tricked into drunkenly travelling to Earth
to destroy the Man of Steel.

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:35.290
Lobo beat Supes so badly that the Kryptonian
hero had to obtain some power armour to fight

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:40.600
back - and Lobo had the audacity to refer
to him as names like "Superwimp".

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:43.580
Muhammad Ali
The late boxing legend Muhammad Ali was the

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:47.680
closest thing to a real-life superhero that
we're ever likely to see - and he possessed

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:52.350
one hell of a powerful knockout punch - and
he actually defeated Superman in a boxing

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:58.080
match in the aptly named Superman vs. Muhammad
Ali comic of 1978.When a maniacal alien leader

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:02.289
demanded that Earth's greatest fighter challenge
the greatest warrior from his planet, both

00:05:02.289 --> 00:05:05.550
Superman and Muhammad Ali put themselves forward
to face him.

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:09.650
In order to determine who wet on to challenge
the alien warrior, Supes and Ali fought each

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:14.010
other in a boxing match - with the Man of
Steel depowered to make things fair.

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:20.800
The greatest of all time prevailed and went
on to defeat the alien by knockout as well.

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:22.210
Lex Luthor
Wait?

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:23.210
What?

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:27.389
Why is Lex Luthor appearing on a list of superheroes
who have beaten Superman?

00:05:27.389 --> 00:05:32.580
Well, that would be because he IS a superhero
in the New 52 reboot - having joined the Justice

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:38.050
League in that timeline - and he HAS defeated
Superman on numerous occasions over the years.Lex's

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:42.840
power comes from his mind - he truly is a
genius - and he has used this to great effect

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:44.800
against his long-time arch-foe.

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:48.319
Knowing Superman's weakness is Kryptonite,
Luthor has utilised it against the Man of

00:05:48.319 --> 00:05:53.690
Steel many times - even building a power armour
with various Kryptonite-based weapons installed

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:56.870
to take the hero down.

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:59.680
The Avengers
Superman and his fellow DC characters have

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:03.680
crossed over with characters from other brands
and franchises on countless occasions over

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:07.849
the years - and Superman tends to get the
better of most of them - but when DC and Marvel

00:06:07.849 --> 00:06:12.069
crossed over on this particular occasion,
Earth's Mightiest Heroes got the better of

00:06:12.069 --> 00:06:17.320
the Kryptonian hero.It happened in Avengers/JLA
#2, when Superman had actually just narrowly

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:19.450
defeated Thor in one-on-one combat.

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:25.169
A tired Man of Steel was set upon by the likes
of Iron Man, Vision, Hercules, Wonder Man

00:06:25.169 --> 00:06:49.990
and She-Hulk - and the five-on-one beatdown
was enough to see Supes knocked unconscious.

00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:54.199
