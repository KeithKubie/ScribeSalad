SPEAKER 1: Sean, hi.

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.670
GDG is a very interesting
development community.

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:12.006
SPEAKER 2: I'm glad somebody
has asked this question.

00:00:12.006 --> 00:00:12.960
SPEAKER 3: This is where
the magic happens.

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.790
SPEAKER 4: This is primarily
a question and answer show.

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.105
So if any of you would like
to ask questions.

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:24.460
CLAUDIO: Hi, everyone.

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:26.920
Welcome back to Google
Developers Live.

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:28.590
My name is Claudio
and this is Vic.

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.910
We are two engineers in the
Google Drive SDK team.

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:36.920
Today we're going to review on
an app that is on the Chrome

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.990
Web Store and that integrates
with Google Drive.

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:44.700
We decided for today we wanted
to show something that might

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.330
be useful for students
going back to school.

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:48.900
So what is this app, Vic?

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:51.760
VIC: So the app is called the
Desmos Graphing Calculator.

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:54.410
And it's a very popular app
in the Chrome Web Store.

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:56.830
I have their homepage
open here.

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:00.180
And we can just take a look
through the core application.

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.040
So essentially what it allows
you to do is write a series of

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:05.850
equations that come up with a
graphical representation.

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.470
So if we scroll down here,
here's some recent graphs that

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:09.930
people have made.

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:10.900
Here's Batman.

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:13.800
So somebody wrote some
equations that

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:14.940
created a bat symbol.

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:16.350
CLAUDIO: How does that
help with school?

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.960
VIC: Well learning must
be fun, right?

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:19.780
CLAUDIO: OK.

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:22.210
VIC: So if you create Batman,
you'll probably learn a lot

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:23.310
about these equations
because these

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.320
are not trivial equations.

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.760
There's some other ones
here that are a

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:32.140
little bit more relevant.

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:37.660
So here's a couple of waves
and linear equations.

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:43.010
So essentially this application
is targeted at

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:47.060
anybody who needs to make graphs
very often, which, I

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:51.460
think, is largely students
working on classes.

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:56.110
So this is an app that
integrates with Google Drive

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:57.820
by the Chrome Web Store.

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:01.260
So to take a look today at this
app and then review it,

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.390
we're going to install it from
the Chrome web store.

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.770
So here I am in Drive, and I'm
going to get more apps.

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.850
And then when the Chrome Web
Store comes up, we're going to

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:12.605
see all of the Google
Drive apps.

00:02:12.605 --> 00:02:15.610
CLAUDIO:So when you click on Get
More Apps, you're brought

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:18.110
to a specific collection inside
the Chrome Web Store

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:20.130
where you can see all the
applications that integrate

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.910
with Drive?

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:22.090
VIC: Yeah, so there's a lot.

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:24.290
But the one that we're looking
for today is Desmos Graphing

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:25.930
Calculator, which
is right here.

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:32.200
So if you click Add to Chrome,
this is going to install it.

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:36.850
Here we see that it came up in
the Chrome New Tab page.

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:41.460
I'm going to come back to Drive,
and we'll be able to

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:45.810
create more Graphing Calculator
by Desmos.

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:51.630
So if I create this, the first
thing that we have to do is

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:56.340
authorize the application, and
tell it that it can create

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.360
graph files on our behalf,
and store them in Drive.

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:00.615
So we're going to
allow access.

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:07.830
And then, finally, we're
taken into Desmos.

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:09.980
So here the graph is
currently empty

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:10.890
because we have no equations.

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:16.035
But if I enter some equations
here, like here's one for a

00:03:16.035 --> 00:03:19.820
circle, it graphs instantly.

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:24.810
And we can add more equations,
like x plus y equals 2 just

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:25.900
for a line.

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:31.060
So we could continue doing
this, and then save it to

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:32.490
Desmos or to Drive.

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:36.330
So here if we click Save, it's
asking us to create a new

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:38.320
account or to log in.

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:40.290
VIC: This is a new account
on Desmos, right?

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:41.560
This is not a Google account.

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:41.850
VIC: Yeah.

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:44.020
The one difference is
that we can sign in

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:46.420
with OpenID on Google.

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:50.830
And then you'll notice it asks
us to authorize again.

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:52.100
And we come back, and now we're

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:53.400
actually saving the graph.

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:57.240
So we'll say line and circle.

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:58.980
And we'll just share it with
the world for now and click

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:00.980
Save Graph.

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:04.662
So here we get a permalink and
some ways to share it.

00:04:04.662 --> 00:04:06.290
Take me back to my graph.

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:12.430
So one of the advantages of this
application is that you

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:15.000
can instantaneously graph pretty
much any equation.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.829
It's very, very powerful
for students.

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:20.970
CLAUDIO: And you can also start
from someone else's

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:24.910
graph, and see how that
translates into equations.

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:27.120
Maybe it's very hard to
understand, at least for me.

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:29.360
But for some people, this can
be very, very easy to

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:29.850
understand.

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:34.860
And you can easily move back and
forth equation to graph.

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:37.810
Can you also edit it?

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:38.150
VIC: Yeah.

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:40.540
So here I could create a new
expression on this graph.

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:43.340
And then x squared
plus y squared--

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:46.070
CLAUDIO: So you can start from
someone else's equation and

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:47.707
extend it or change it?

00:04:47.707 --> 00:04:48.681
VIC: Yeah.

00:04:48.681 --> 00:04:54.680
So if we do that, then
it really is good for

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:57.730
collaboration between students
and teachers.

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:00.960
So here, maybe a teacher creates
a template graph and

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:04.370
then asks students to add some
equations that will intersect

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:06.930
certain points, or something
like that.

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:09.310
So super powerful app.

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:11.440
There's also a keypad, and
there's some other additional

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:15.810
settings that you can do to
customize the graphs.

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:20.280
Like you can change the labels
on each of the axes

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:21.480
and things like that.

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:26.930
So we're very pleased with
the core application.

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:29.670
What we were going to talk
about today is how they

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:32.400
integrate with Drive and what
they could do better or what

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:33.180
they already do well.

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:34.830
CLAUDIO: OK.

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:38.450
I think we can start from the
authorization mechanism.

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:39.440
VIC: Yeah.

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:45.500
So when a user originates in
Drive, they create more

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:48.170
Graphing Calculator by Desmos.

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:52.960
One of the problems is that
Desmos currently is not

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:56.640
automatically logging the
user in when they

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:58.020
originate from Drive.

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:00.730
And this is a problem because it
causes the user to have to

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:01.460
log in twice.

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:04.578
So here, actually, if I log out,
we can demonstrate this a

00:06:04.578 --> 00:06:05.120
little bit more easily.

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:07.700
So if I create another graph.

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:13.450
The user should arrive at the
application logged in.

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:16.170
But you can see that we're
not logged in.

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:19.100
So this is one convenience
mechanism for users

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:20.770
originating from Drive.

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:23.770
Also, if the user originates
from Drive, there's no way to

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:26.150
actually save back to
Drive at the moment.

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:29.230
So I believe that this is
something that Desmos used to

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:34.490
support but removed temporarily
because of some

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:38.240
integration issues between
Desmos and Google Drive.

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:40.610
I think that those are issues
we've since resolved.

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:44.650
And so we're really looking
forward to Desmos bringing

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:45.570
this functionality back.

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:48.620
CLAUDIO: So what should be the
best flow for the user?

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:51.780
VIC: Ideally the best flow for
the user is creating a graph

00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:53.380
from within Google Drive.

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:57.770
And when they land here,
they are logged in.

00:06:57.770 --> 00:07:03.700
And they create some
graph like this.

00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:07.000
And when they click Save,
instead of requiring the user

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.970
to log in again, or create a
Desmos account, instead of

00:07:11.970 --> 00:07:14.240
walking through this flow, where
I have to authorize a

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:21.060
second time, and then do this
to save my graph, everything

00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:23.900
is saved into Drive
automatically.

00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:25.610
CLAUDIO: But right
now it's not.

00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:25.810
VIC: Right.

00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:29.010
Right now, nothing has been
saved into Drive.

00:07:29.010 --> 00:07:31.910
In fact, if we look at all
of the files on this test

00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:35.810
account, we can see that there's
just nothing here.

00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:39.020
So Desmos is saving the graph
locally within Desmos.

00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:42.050
So their Drive integration is
missing some key components

00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:46.240
right now, primarily the ability
to create and store

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:49.680
graphs within Drive.

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:53.410
They are also missing the
component to open certain

00:07:53.410 --> 00:07:57.510
graphing files from within
Drive, which is fine.

00:07:57.510 --> 00:08:01.090
But if they were storing native
Desmos graphs in Drive,

00:08:01.090 --> 00:08:01.880
then those should be open.

00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:03.030
CLAUDIO: But they can
also store some

00:08:03.030 --> 00:08:04.350
shortcuts to documents.

00:08:04.350 --> 00:08:06.360
Store them there on
their server.

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:10.430
So it depends on their
implementation.

00:08:10.430 --> 00:08:13.250
But one thing you can do as a
developer is that you can

00:08:13.250 --> 00:08:16.960
still store all the data in your
back end, whatever that

00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:20.190
is, a database, a local file
system, it doesn't matter.

00:08:20.190 --> 00:08:24.260
But you can have shortcuts,
links, or pointers to those

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:26.640
documents from Google Drive.

00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:29.550
And this is not happening
at the moment.

00:08:29.550 --> 00:08:30.620
VIC: That's exactly right.

00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:33.460
So it doesn't matter really
if they store this

00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:35.220
data in Drive or not.

00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:38.980
They could store it on
Desmos.com but link to it with

00:08:38.980 --> 00:08:41.409
a shortcut file from
within Drive.

00:08:44.169 --> 00:08:46.420
We need to make it clear,
though, that Desmos is a

00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:49.940
perfect use case for integrating
like this with

00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:50.910
Google Drive.

00:08:50.910 --> 00:08:54.490
Here they have a single document
interface that's

00:08:54.490 --> 00:08:56.670
working on a single
file at a time.

00:08:56.670 --> 00:09:00.145
And if that file was stored in
Drive or a shortcut was stored

00:09:00.145 --> 00:09:03.680
in Drive, then it would add the
ability for more users to

00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:06.510
interact with these things
more quickly,

00:09:06.510 --> 00:09:08.420
which is pretty important.

00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:10.920
Also, integrating with Drive
gets you things like sharing

00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:14.030
for free, it gets you searching
for free, and things

00:09:14.030 --> 00:09:18.430
like this, and it allows users
to collaborate on these

00:09:18.430 --> 00:09:20.920
documents a little
bit more quickly.

00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:22.940
CLAUDIO: Yeah, there's also
something else they can do to

00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:24.760
make the user experience better,
integrating better

00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:25.740
with Google Drive.

00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:28.830
I see there's a button that
says My Graphs on

00:09:28.830 --> 00:09:30.070
the top left corner.

00:09:30.070 --> 00:09:31.590
What does that do?

00:09:31.590 --> 00:09:34.180
VIC: It shows all of your
graphs saved in Desmos.

00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:37.680
CLAUDIO: They can probably
integrate this with Google

00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:41.680
Drive, and show all the files
you have, all the matching

00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:44.410
files you have, on
Google Drive.

00:09:44.410 --> 00:09:49.760
And if developers want
to integrate with--

00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:52.770
when I have a dialog
to pick files from

00:09:52.770 --> 00:09:55.250
Drive, we provide that.

00:09:55.250 --> 00:09:57.730
It's called Google Picker API.

00:09:57.730 --> 00:09:59.540
It's part of the Google
Drive SDK.

00:09:59.540 --> 00:10:02.480
It's a JavaScript
API you can use.

00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:05.270
You can easily integrate it into
your application, and use

00:10:05.270 --> 00:10:10.570
it to show the lists of files
from the user's account that

00:10:10.570 --> 00:10:12.670
match some specific criteria.

00:10:12.670 --> 00:10:13.240
VIC: Exactly.

00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:17.000
So if we go to the Drive
SDK documentation at

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:23.300
developers.Google.com/drive
somewhere here, I think it's--

00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:24.322
CLAUDIO: Manage Drive Files.

00:10:24.322 --> 00:10:25.590
VIC:Yep.

00:10:25.590 --> 00:10:29.836
And then actually, no.

00:10:29.836 --> 00:10:31.086
I don't think it's there.

00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:34.800
CLAUDIO: Integrate with Drive.

00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:35.240
VIC: Yeah.

00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:36.690
Sorry, we'll just rework
this a little bit.

00:10:36.690 --> 00:10:38.160
So if we open files--

00:10:40.710 --> 00:10:41.710
CLAUDIO: So there are
different ways

00:10:41.710 --> 00:10:42.650
you can open files.

00:10:42.650 --> 00:10:47.310
The first one we saw is that you
click on a file on Drive

00:10:47.310 --> 00:10:50.190
UI or you create a new one,
and that saves it.

00:10:50.190 --> 00:10:52.780
But, as a side, you could
also use a Picker.

00:10:52.780 --> 00:10:53.070
VIC: Yeah.

00:10:53.070 --> 00:10:56.405
So here's the documentation
about how to use the Google

00:10:56.405 --> 00:10:58.060
Drive Picker.

00:10:58.060 --> 00:11:00.920
And, essentially, how to embed
something contextually into

00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:04.840
the page of your application
that will show essentially the

00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:07.760
Google Drive dialog box that
allows you to choose files

00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:08.990
from within Google Drive.

00:11:08.990 --> 00:11:10.150
So you can see it's actually
pretty quick

00:11:10.150 --> 00:11:13.020
and simple to implement.

00:11:13.020 --> 00:11:16.360
In Desmos' case, they may have
a strong opinion that they

00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:19.820
want users only choosing files
from within Desmos.

00:11:19.820 --> 00:11:21.310
And that's fine.

00:11:21.310 --> 00:11:24.890
A Drive SDK integration
is not all or nothing.

00:11:24.890 --> 00:11:26.590
This is just another suggestion
that would make

00:11:26.590 --> 00:11:32.330
their app easier to use from
a Drive user's perspective.

00:11:32.330 --> 00:11:34.890
CLAUDIO: And just about
something while we mentioned

00:11:34.890 --> 00:11:38.330
the Picker The Picker can be
used to select files from

00:11:38.330 --> 00:11:41.420
Drive, but it can also be used
to upload files from Drive.

00:11:41.420 --> 00:11:44.840
So let's say if you have a
client-side application or you

00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:48.220
want the users to upload files,
you can just use the

00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:51.870
same Picker that you use for
downloading to upload.

00:11:51.870 --> 00:11:53.350
Maybe this is not the
case for Desmos.

00:11:53.350 --> 00:11:55.830
I don't think they have to
upload files to Drive.

00:11:55.830 --> 00:11:58.190
But it might be good to know.

00:11:58.190 --> 00:11:59.436
VIC: Exactly.

00:11:59.436 --> 00:11:59.810
Yeah.

00:11:59.810 --> 00:12:04.870
So can you think of any other
ways that Desmos could

00:12:04.870 --> 00:12:07.770
integrate with Drive?

00:12:07.770 --> 00:12:11.400
CLAUDIO: I think the most
confusing part is just the

00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:15.320
authentication and the login,
the user creation, which is

00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:18.140
not clear for users.

00:12:18.140 --> 00:12:21.860
What a Desmos account is, and
what a Google account is.

00:12:21.860 --> 00:12:24.780
I mean, you think you're logged
in into Google, and you

00:12:24.780 --> 00:12:26.670
are, and you're not logged
into Desmos.

00:12:26.670 --> 00:12:28.320
Or you can be logged into
Desmos, but not

00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:29.770
logged in into Google.

00:12:29.770 --> 00:12:33.690
And this has to be as defined
as possible to the users so

00:12:33.690 --> 00:12:36.570
that they log in once
and that's it.

00:12:36.570 --> 00:12:41.170
And that's why we want
developers to use OpenID,

00:12:41.170 --> 00:12:44.930
which is the technology that
allows you to delegate

00:12:44.930 --> 00:12:47.460
authentication to Google.

00:12:47.460 --> 00:12:52.700
VIC: So other apps get around
this in that if, for instance,

00:12:52.700 --> 00:12:55.620
another application needed to
make a native account, they

00:12:55.620 --> 00:12:58.280
would automatically create the
native account and associate

00:12:58.280 --> 00:13:01.860
the incoming Google user
with that account.

00:13:01.860 --> 00:13:05.390
So when the user arrives from
Drive, Drive also sends a

00:13:05.390 --> 00:13:06.560
token along.

00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:15.130
And the application should be
using this token to gain

00:13:15.130 --> 00:13:18.320
access to a user's Drive
files when they arrive.

00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:20.330
Because the user, after
they've installed the

00:13:20.330 --> 00:13:22.730
application and run it from
within Drive, has already

00:13:22.730 --> 00:13:26.030
authorized the app to access
certain files.

00:13:26.030 --> 00:13:29.010
So that could be a little bit
cleaned up so that when I come

00:13:29.010 --> 00:13:33.030
here and I create more Graphing
Calculator, I land

00:13:33.030 --> 00:13:36.420
here, I'm signed in, and when
I save the file, it

00:13:36.420 --> 00:13:38.350
automatically goes back to Drive
because that's where I

00:13:38.350 --> 00:13:40.110
originated from anyway.

00:13:40.110 --> 00:13:42.600
CLAUDIO: And another suggestion
I might have, it

00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:47.800
depends on what is the file
format they use to store their

00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:49.630
data on Drive.

00:13:49.630 --> 00:13:54.080
So regardless if they have
only a shortcut to their

00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:58.090
document somewhere else, or if
they store everything on

00:13:58.090 --> 00:14:02.110
Drive, this can probably be
easily translated into some

00:14:02.110 --> 00:14:06.680
XML file, or something like
that, some kind of text files.

00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:11.500
Something they can do to make it
easier for Google to index

00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:14.900
the text content so that it
can be easier for users to

00:14:14.900 --> 00:14:16.600
find a document.

00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:20.670
So whenever you create an
equation, but when you save

00:14:20.670 --> 00:14:23.580
it, I think you could also add
some description fields, some

00:14:23.580 --> 00:14:25.830
tags, or something like that.

00:14:25.830 --> 00:14:32.970
So if that is a text file, then
Google will automatically

00:14:32.970 --> 00:14:38.090
index that text so that users
can find it by searching for

00:14:38.090 --> 00:14:39.100
some terms.

00:14:39.100 --> 00:14:42.940
But if there is a binary format,
we don't have a way to

00:14:42.940 --> 00:14:44.830
find out what the text is.

00:14:44.830 --> 00:14:46.380
VIC: Currently within
Desmos, yeah.

00:14:46.380 --> 00:14:46.810
CLAUDIO: Yeah.

00:14:46.810 --> 00:14:51.600
And developers can provide some
indexable tags for us.

00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:55.640
So there is this field in the
API that they can use so that

00:14:55.640 --> 00:14:59.310
even if we don't know what the
file format is, and we don't

00:14:59.310 --> 00:15:02.100
know how to open a specific
file, or read what the text

00:15:02.100 --> 00:15:06.000
content is, you can still
provide us with some text

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:10.060
content, and we will index it
and we will treat it exactly

00:15:10.060 --> 00:15:12.560
the same way as we treat
the text we index.

00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:14.260
VIC:Yeah, exactly.

00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:19.000
So when creating or updating a
file, applications can set the

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.390
indexable text, which is here.

00:15:22.390 --> 00:15:25.680
So, like Claudio said, it's just
a field of keywords, a

00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:26.520
normal text field.

00:15:26.520 --> 00:15:29.750
And you set whatever keywords
you'd like Google to index on.

00:15:29.750 --> 00:15:31.590
And then when the user searches
for something in

00:15:31.590 --> 00:15:33.700
Google Drive, if one of those
keywords matches,

00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:36.340
then we show the file.

00:15:36.340 --> 00:15:38.580
CLAUDIO: One of the things to
mention about the indexable

00:15:38.580 --> 00:15:43.690
text field is that field
is write only.

00:15:43.690 --> 00:15:48.090
And you have to provide a new
indexable text field every

00:15:48.090 --> 00:15:51.120
time you update the document
because, of course, if you

00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:55.280
changed the content of your
document, you have to change

00:15:55.280 --> 00:15:57.160
the indexable text
accordingly.

00:15:57.160 --> 00:16:00.310
And if you don't provide a new
indexable text when you update

00:16:00.310 --> 00:16:03.800
an existing file, we will assume
you just want to clear

00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:08.020
that field, so we will store
an empty indexable text.

00:16:08.020 --> 00:16:10.140
VIC: So this is a future request
that we've gotten is

00:16:10.140 --> 00:16:12.840
to make the indexable text
readable by applications, and

00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:15.790
it's something we're
considering.

00:16:15.790 --> 00:16:19.870
So getting back to Desmos,
this is a really, really

00:16:19.870 --> 00:16:24.020
powerful application that we
highly recommend you use.

00:16:24.020 --> 00:16:26.580
Go to the Chrome Web Store,
install Desmos Graphing

00:16:26.580 --> 00:16:28.030
Calculator.

00:16:28.030 --> 00:16:29.420
It's very powerful.

00:16:29.420 --> 00:16:32.130
I actually use it somewhat
often now that

00:16:32.130 --> 00:16:33.410
I've discovered it.

00:16:33.410 --> 00:16:35.630
It's very, very convenient for
just drawing graphs of

00:16:35.630 --> 00:16:37.500
equations, which we do often.

00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:41.160
CLAUDIO: Just to, before we wrap
up, so you showed how to

00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:44.800
get to the Chrome Web Store
when you start from Drive.

00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:46.180
And that is really easy.

00:16:46.180 --> 00:16:48.530
So you said you wanted
to create something.

00:16:48.530 --> 00:16:50.470
You don't have an application,
so you do more, and

00:16:50.470 --> 00:16:53.110
you get more apps.

00:16:53.110 --> 00:16:56.140
And this will land you
directly to the Drive

00:16:56.140 --> 00:16:57.350
application collection.

00:16:57.350 --> 00:17:00.260
What if you start from the
Web Store directly?

00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:02.620
How do you find this collection
inside Drive?

00:17:02.620 --> 00:17:03.330
VIC: That's a good point.

00:17:03.330 --> 00:17:04.420
CLAUDIO: The Web Store.

00:17:04.420 --> 00:17:06.560
VIC: So if we just land in the
normal Chrome Web Store, this

00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:07.150
is what it looks like.

00:17:07.150 --> 00:17:09.349
You can see various types
of applications here.

00:17:09.349 --> 00:17:11.439
If you want to see all of the
Google Drive applications,

00:17:11.439 --> 00:17:13.980
just go to Collections and
then Google Drive.

00:17:13.980 --> 00:17:16.069
And then here you can see all
of the apps that have some

00:17:16.069 --> 00:17:18.150
integration with Google Drive.

00:17:18.150 --> 00:17:18.810
So there's a lot.

00:17:18.810 --> 00:17:21.480
We recommend you just take
a look through them.

00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:24.339
There's a bunch of image
editors, presentation editors,

00:17:24.339 --> 00:17:30.130
there's AutoCAD WS, if you
work with CAD documents.

00:17:30.130 --> 00:17:35.380
CLAUDIO: And also to make it
easy to recognize Google Drive

00:17:35.380 --> 00:17:39.910
applications, we added a
small logo, 2H listing.

00:17:39.910 --> 00:17:42.560
So that is the Google
Drive logo on the

00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:43.600
bottom right corner.

00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:48.240
And if you click on one of those
listings, you will see

00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:50.070
that it works with Google
Drive, which is

00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:51.200
our badge for it.

00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:51.620
VIC: Exactly.

00:17:51.620 --> 00:17:52.460
Yep.

00:17:52.460 --> 00:17:56.710
CLAUDIO: And, of course, as in
all applications in the Chrome

00:17:56.710 --> 00:18:00.410
Web Store, you can read reviews
from other users.

00:18:00.410 --> 00:18:03.530
You can see star rating,
and so on.

00:18:03.530 --> 00:18:05.880
VIC: Yeah, so here's the
listing for Desmos.

00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:09.426
You can see they have 142
five-star reviews.

00:18:09.426 --> 00:18:12.380
So if we go into the reviews,
you can see this first review

00:18:12.380 --> 00:18:15.110
here from a Google user,
"Nothing short of amazing.

00:18:15.110 --> 00:18:17.260
Best thing out there.

00:18:17.260 --> 00:18:18.100
It's so good.

00:18:18.100 --> 00:18:20.160
I've never seen such a perfect
graphing calculator."

00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:21.300
CLAUDIO: Yeah, it's an
amazing application.

00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:21.660
VIC: Great application.

00:18:21.660 --> 00:18:24.530
CLAUDIO: You should try it.

00:18:24.530 --> 00:18:24.860
VIC: All right.

00:18:24.860 --> 00:18:26.720
So that about wraps
it up for today's

00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:27.860
Google Developers Live.

00:18:27.860 --> 00:18:30.746
