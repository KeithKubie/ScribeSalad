00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:13.960
As 
well-known for leading a flamboyant, playboy

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:18.990
lifestyle as being the mastermind responsible
for funneling $5 billion dollars (about $12

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.661
billion today) to Afghan rebels (when they
were on our side) in their fight against the

00:00:23.661 --> 00:00:28.490
Soviet Union, Texas Congressman Charlie Wilson
was a larger than life character who serves

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:33.390
as a stark reminder of how different the political
landscape was before social media and the

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:34.690
24 hour news cycle.

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:39.320
So it should come as no surprise that his
first introduction into politics was just

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:41.930
as notable as his later exploits.

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:47.559
Charlie was born on June 1, 1933 and raised
in Trinity, Texas, a small town north of Houston.

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:51.560
As he explained in the book Charlie Wilson’s
War: The Extraordinary Story of the Largest

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:56.420
Covert Operation in History, written by George
Crile, when Charlie was 13, his dog strayed

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.820
into his neighbor’s, Charles Hazard’s,
yard one too many times.

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.890
Hazard, living up to his name, fed the dog
something that contained crushed glass, ultimately

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.470
leading to the dog’s death.

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:10.100
Unsurprisingly, Charlie sought revenge – first
by setting Hazard’s garden on fire with

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.640
a little help from a decent amount of gasoline.

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:14.530
This did not satisfy him, however.

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:18.670
Realizing the man sat on Trinity’s City
Council, Charlie decided to hit Hazard where

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:19.900
it really hurt.

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:24.320
Organizing a campaign against the dog-murderer,
Charlie took the family Chevy truck and in

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:30.119
total drove just shy of 100 voters to the
polls for the next City Council election.

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.580
As each voter left the vehicle, Charlie told
them what Hazard had done to his dog.

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:40.530
The 95 voters transported by Charlie that
day comprised about 25% of those that voted.

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.700
Hazard lost his bid for reelection by 16 votes.

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.900
Making sure Hazard knew Charlie was behind
the loss, he went by his house after and told

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:50.790
him maybe he “shouldn’t poison any more
dogs.”

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.460
As you may or may not already know, Charlie
went on to be rather successful in politics,

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:59.980
although it appears mostly due to a fair amount
of personal charm and ingenuity, rather than

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:02.860
strictly hard work and adherence to the rules.

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:07.509
In fact, his political career was highlighted
by various sexcapades, drunken car crashes

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:12.569
(including a hit and run, which he was only
fined $25 for), being a functioning alcoholic,

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:17.450
investigations for drug use (including cocaine),
and stealing a car used by one of Lyndon B.

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:22.109
Johnson’s Secret Service agents and then
hiding it in an alley.

00:02:22.109 --> 00:02:23.299
Why?

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:28.239
He felt Johnson’s Secret Service agents
were “assholes” and this one in particular

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:30.750
had double parked, blocking his car.

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.510
Never seeming to learn from his mistakes,
Charlie noted in an interview that his largely

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:38.650
Christian voter base continued to elect him
because “When the day was done, the working

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:41.609
people knew I was on their side, and the blacks
knew I was on their side.

00:02:41.609 --> 00:02:45.750
And it’s hard to explain, but there is a
tolerance for human frailty that doesn’t

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.749
exist outside of East Texas…

00:02:47.749 --> 00:02:52.389
The good Lord blessed me with the world’s
most tolerant and forgiving constituency…”

00:02:52.389 --> 00:02:56.569
As for the more direct start of his political
career, receiving an appointment to the U.S.

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:01.230
Naval Academy at Annapolis, Charlie was infamous
for his poor grades, shoes lacking polish

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:02.700
and missing curfew.

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:08.019
In fact, when he graduated 8th from the bottom
in 1956 with a degree in electrical engineering,

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:13.140
he left with the distinction of having the
most demerits in the history of the academy.

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:16.900
Serving in the Navy for five years, Charlie
violated the rules and ran for Texas state

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:21.379
representative while still on active duty
(a no-no as active duty individuals are not

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:22.939
allowed to hold public office.)

00:03:22.939 --> 00:03:27.359
Utilizing his charm, however, Charlie campaigned
door to door, winning the election.

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:32.180
He was just 27 when he began the first of
his 12 terms as a Texas legislator.

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:36.989
Because he was Democrat in the mode of JFK,
he earned the nickname the “liberal from

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:37.989
Lufkin”.

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:41.870
Tall, handsome and charming, Charlie was a
well-known womanizer, with his exploits frequently

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:46.459
being reported in the media right down to
his bedroom hot tub equipped with handcuffs,

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:50.199
as well as an incident in Las Vegas in which
he ultimately was investigated for cocaine

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:51.199
use.

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:52.849
As for Charlie, he noted of that particular
escapade,

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:55.849
The girls [strippers] had cocaine, and the
music was loud.

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:57.339
It was total happiness.

00:03:57.339 --> 00:04:01.680
And both of them had ten long, red fingernails
with an endless supply of beautiful white

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:02.680
powder….

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:06.439
The feds spent a million bucks trying to figure
out whether, when those fingernails passed

00:04:06.439 --> 00:04:10.469
under my nose, did I inhale or exhale, and
I ain’t telling.

00:04:10.469 --> 00:04:15.549
Despite such unabashed behavior, Charlie paradoxically
had no trouble getting votes from women; he

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:17.139
once described his appeal:

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:22.330
Feminists like me because I am an unapologetic
sexist, chauvinist redneck who votes with

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:23.539
’em every time…

00:04:23.539 --> 00:04:27.289
On that note, Charlie’s political platform
was largely built on pushing for equal rights

00:04:27.289 --> 00:04:32.620
for women and minorities, raising minimum
wage, tax exemptions for the elderly and Medicaid.

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:36.759
Not just surrounding himself with beautiful
women outside of the office, Charlie did so

00:04:36.759 --> 00:04:38.090
within as well.

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:41.819
After he became the U.S. Congressman for Second
Congressional District for Texas, he broke

00:04:41.819 --> 00:04:46.930
with Washington, D.C. tradition and employed
a bevy of female staffers, publicly stating

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:50.790
of his choice in hiring women instead of men
in an era when that was rarely done, “You

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:55.490
can teach ’em to type, but you can’t teach
’em how to grow tits…”

00:04:55.490 --> 00:05:01.580
Young, hard working, and beautiful, including
one Miss USA, the female contingent in his

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:04.020
office became known as “Charlie’s Angels.”

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:07.900
Charlie noted that many of his fellow politicians
didn’t mind and that “Bill Clinton used

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:12.400
to say I was the only congressman who didn’t
need an appointment to see him, as long as

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:14.430
I didn’t come understaffed…”

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:18.550
As for Charlie’s work, his most famous achievement
was getting the Afghan rebels funding, with

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:24.300
this memorialized in the movie Charlie Wilson’s
War (2007), starring Tom Hanks and Julia Roberts.

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:28.680
Initially a cause of his close friend, conservative
Houston socialite Joanne Herring, Charlie

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:32.789
parlayed his influential positions on the
House Appropriations Committee and Subcommittee

00:05:32.789 --> 00:05:37.629
on Foreign Operations into billions of dollars
to support efforts against the Soviets (who

00:05:37.629 --> 00:05:40.410
had invaded the country in 1979).

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:44.569
Spurred by Herring to help, Charlie visited
a refugee camp in Pakistan early in the war

00:05:44.569 --> 00:05:47.780
and, after seeing the suffering there, was
sold on supporting them.

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:49.110
He noted of this experience,

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:53.340
…going through those hospitals and seeing,
especially those children with their hands

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:56.889
blown off from the mines that the Soviets
were dropping from their helicopters.

00:05:56.889 --> 00:06:01.490
That was perhaps the deciding thing… and
it made a huge difference for the next 10

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:05.520
or 12 years of my life because I left those
hospitals determined, as long as I had a breath

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:10.449
in my body and was a member in Congress, that
I was going to do what I could to make the

00:06:10.449 --> 00:06:11.900
Soviets pay for what they were doing!

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:16.820
And that, “The U.S. had nothing whatsoever
to do with these people’s decision to fight

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:21.389
… but we’ll be damned by history if we
let them fight with stones.”

00:06:21.389 --> 00:06:24.039
Working over the next decade, through numerous
clever dealings (and voting for military contracts

00:06:24.039 --> 00:06:25.550
in his colleagues’ districts to get their
support), Charlie succeeded in increasing

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:31.610
support for the Afghans from a few million
in the early 1980s to $750 million (about

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:35.910
$1.7 billion today) each year by the end of
the decade.

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:40.479
More than just money, at various times Charlie
also provided things like mules (from Tennessee),

00:06:40.479 --> 00:06:44.699
stinger missiles, and walkie-talkies- some
of the latter he purchased at a Virginia Radio

00:06:44.699 --> 00:06:48.270
Shack when the CIA refused to provide more
advanced field radios.

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:53.020
(Not that the CIA’s relationship with him
wasn’t good, with Charlie becoming the first

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:55.889
civilian to be given the CIA’s Honored Colleague
Award.)

00:06:55.889 --> 00:06:59.529
Charlie_Wilson_gravestone_IMG_6165Declining
to seek re-election in 1996, Charlie retired,

00:06:59.529 --> 00:07:05.460
ultimately dying of cardiac arrest on February
10, 2010 at the age of 76 in Lufkin, Texas.

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:09.479
And if you’re wondering about Charlie’s
thoughts given what has happened in Afghanistan

00:07:09.479 --> 00:07:13.419
since the Soviets left, he laments that the
U.S. didn’t choose to stick around and help

00:07:13.419 --> 00:07:17.860
rebuild Afghanistan, resulting in a power
vacuum and instability in the region that

00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:20.099
allowed the Taliban regime to take hold.

00:07:20.099 --> 00:07:24.930
He further defended the former support the
United States gave to certain infamous individuals,

00:07:24.930 --> 00:07:29.470
including Osama bin Laden, stating in a Time
magazine interview shortly before his death,

00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:31.159
We were fighting the evil empire.

00:07:31.159 --> 00:07:34.669
It would have been like not supplying the
Soviets against Hitler in World War II.

00:07:34.669 --> 00:07:37.270
. . . Anyway, who the hell had ever heard
of the Taliban then?

00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:41.300
And that, “You think this f—er [Ayman
al-Zawahiri] they’re chasing around now

00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:43.680
in the tribal areas of Pakistan is terrifying?

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:47.319
Well, what was terrifying was a nuclear exchange
between us and the Russians.

00:07:47.319 --> 00:07:51.729
What was terrifying was the idea of a Soviet
invasion of Western Europe and what we would

00:07:51.729 --> 00:07:52.939
have had to do about that.

00:07:52.939 --> 00:07:55.919
I have absolutely zero regrets.”
