00:00:00.038 --> 00:00:02.788
Male: Please join me in
welcoming Salman Khan.

00:00:02.788 --> 00:00:08.339
(audience applauding)

00:00:08.339 --> 00:00:10.681
Welcome, Salman. Thank you so much.

00:00:10.681 --> 00:00:13.749
Khan: Good to be here. Thanks a bunch.

00:00:13.749 --> 00:00:15.387
Very exciting to be here.

00:00:15.387 --> 00:00:18.923
So before I start, I'd like
to get a sense of where the

00:00:18.923 --> 00:00:21.592
audience is and how much
they might know about Khan

00:00:21.592 --> 00:00:23.328
Academy. How many of y'all
have either used it or

00:00:23.328 --> 00:00:25.940
somewhat familiar with the
site to a certain degree?

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:28.523
Oh, very good, very good.
How many of you have

00:00:28.523 --> 00:00:31.107
used it with your kids, your
kids actively use the site.

00:00:31.107 --> 00:00:33.190
Oh, this is very exciting.
All right, very good.

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:36.219
So just to start off. There
were some of y'all that

00:00:36.219 --> 00:00:38.908
didn't raise your hands.
To get everyone on the same

00:00:38.908 --> 00:00:41.178
page, Khan Academy is most known for this

00:00:41.178 --> 00:00:43.171
collection of videos and I'll
talk a little bit about how

00:00:43.201 --> 00:00:45.515
all of this got started, but
I literally started making

00:00:45.515 --> 00:00:48.015
for my cousins and so I'll
show a montage of those

00:00:48.015 --> 00:00:50.347
videos and you'll see what
they feel like and then

00:00:50.347 --> 00:00:52.053
you'll also see some of
the other video direction

00:00:52.053 --> 00:00:54.290
we're going in, not all
of them are made by me

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:56.726
anymore and we're starting
to experiment with some

00:00:56.726 --> 00:01:00.872
other styles. So, let me show
you what that looks like.

00:01:01.563 --> 00:01:04.430
We could integrate over the
surface and the notation

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:06.258
usually is a capital sigma.

00:01:06.258 --> 00:01:08.341
All these interactions are
just through the gravity

00:01:08.341 --> 00:01:11.577
over interstellar or almost you
could call it intergalactic.

00:01:11.577 --> 00:01:13.908
This animal's fossils are
only found in this area of

00:01:13.908 --> 00:01:16.145
South America, a nice clean band here.

00:01:16.145 --> 00:01:20.581
Notice this is an aldehyde
and it's an alcohol.

00:01:20.581 --> 00:01:23.652
It's their 30,000,000
plus the $20,000,000 from

00:01:23.652 --> 00:01:25.119
the American manufacturer.

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:27.089
They created The Committee
of Public Safety,

00:01:27.089 --> 00:01:28.300
which sounds like a very nice committee.

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:29.691
Steven: This is not Eve.

00:01:29.691 --> 00:01:33.068
Beth: No, Botticelli's portrayed
the ancient goddess of love.

00:01:33.068 --> 00:01:37.105
Voiceover: This is 6x6x6 or 216.

00:01:37.105 --> 00:01:40.719
LeBron: I'm told the humidity
makes it feel hotter. Why is this?

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:42.148
Khan: Excellent question Lebron.

00:01:42.148 --> 00:01:44.082
Voiceover: Let's just like make it eleven.

00:01:44.082 --> 00:01:47.265
Khan: Play with the pendulum
and get a feel for how it moves.

00:01:47.265 --> 00:01:49.801
Voiceover: Function as a bridge rectifier.

00:01:49.801 --> 00:01:51.950
Voiceover: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8.

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:57.724
Khan: If this does not blow your
mind, then you have no emotion.

00:01:57.724 --> 00:02:01.242
(audience laughing)

00:02:01.242 --> 00:02:05.527
Khan: I can ... I can always tell
the intelligence of an audience

00:02:05.527 --> 00:02:07.152
based on how much they
appreciate Euler's identity,

00:02:07.152 --> 00:02:11.019
so y'all have ... y'all have
passed that, passed that.

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:14.734
So just to give a snapshot
of where we are now,

00:02:14.734 --> 00:02:19.484
we've reached 75 million
unique students since kind of

00:02:19.484 --> 00:02:21.261
this adventure began.

00:02:21.261 --> 00:02:23.163
Over ... I think actually
the numbers are now

00:02:23.163 --> 00:02:25.762
240 million videos have been watched.

00:02:25.762 --> 00:02:28.002
We actually just crossed our
billionth exercise. I know the

00:02:28.002 --> 00:02:30.190
slide says 900 million,
but our billionth exercise

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:32.658
literally a couple of weeks
ago. We're being used in

00:02:32.658 --> 00:02:36.326
20,000 classrooms and
what you saw now are just

00:02:36.326 --> 00:02:39.896
the videos, but what I want
to do is rewind a little bit

00:02:39.896 --> 00:02:42.331
and tell, talk about how all
of this got started and then

00:02:42.331 --> 00:02:44.685
talk about where we see Khan Academy going

00:02:44.685 --> 00:02:47.353
because we think it's a lot
more than just the videos

00:02:47.353 --> 00:02:50.935
that I initially started
making for family.

00:02:50.935 --> 00:02:56.206
So if you were ... If you
rewind back to 2004, I was a,

00:02:56.206 --> 00:02:58.749
my background is originally
in computer science, but

00:02:58.749 --> 00:03:01.319
I had gone to business
school. I now found myself,

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:04.422
I was an analyst at a hedge
fund and I had just gotten

00:03:04.422 --> 00:03:08.092
married and I had some
family visiting me from

00:03:08.092 --> 00:03:10.160
New Orleans, which is
where I grew up. They were

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:13.496
visiting me up in Boston
and while they were there,

00:03:13.496 --> 00:03:16.367
it was three of my
cousins and their parents,

00:03:16.367 --> 00:03:19.291
my uncle and aunt and
the oldest of my cousins,

00:03:19.291 --> 00:03:21.605
Nadia, who was 12 years old
at the time, it just came

00:03:21.605 --> 00:03:23.916
out in conversation at some
point that she was having

00:03:23.916 --> 00:03:27.745
trouble in mathematics and
so I said, "Nadia, you seem

00:03:27.745 --> 00:03:29.648
like a very bright young
woman. What seems to be

00:03:29.648 --> 00:03:34.084
the problem?" and she said
it was unit conversion.

00:03:34.084 --> 00:03:36.152
And I said, "You know, I'm
completely convinced that

00:03:36.152 --> 00:03:38.158
you can tackle unit conversion."
and she thought it was

00:03:38.158 --> 00:03:40.324
just one of these empty
pep talks. I could kind of

00:03:40.324 --> 00:03:43.157
sense that she was rolling
her eyes inside of her brain

00:03:43.157 --> 00:03:45.711
and so I said ... I kind of
viewed that as a little bit of

00:03:45.711 --> 00:03:48.114
a challenge. So I said,
"Okay, how about this?"

00:03:48.114 --> 00:03:50.716
"You go back to New
Orleans.", I'm in Boston.

00:03:50.716 --> 00:03:53.574
"Every day after work for
me, after school for you,"

00:03:53.574 --> 00:03:57.819
"I tutor you and we try to
get you past this threshold."

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:00.624
and I think she was excited
that someone was willing

00:04:00.624 --> 00:04:04.220
to take this, the time out
for her and so she agreed

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:07.531
and so they went back to
New Orleans and long story

00:04:07.531 --> 00:04:09.324
short, you know, every
day we worked together.

00:04:09.324 --> 00:04:11.656
It was difficult at first. She
kind of psyched herself out,

00:04:11.656 --> 00:04:14.325
convinced herself that she
was no good at mathematics,

00:04:14.325 --> 00:04:17.373
but about a month into it, she
was able to ... things clicked

00:04:17.373 --> 00:04:19.431
and she was able to catch
up. Then she actually started

00:04:19.431 --> 00:04:21.736
to get a little bit ahead of the
curve, a little bit ahead of where

00:04:21.736 --> 00:04:24.737
her class might be and at
that point I'd like to say I

00:04:24.737 --> 00:04:30.955
became what I call a "tiger
cousin" and I called up her

00:04:30.955 --> 00:04:34.070
school and I said, "You know,
I really think Nadia needs

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:36.571
to retake the placement
exam, go into the faster

00:04:36.571 --> 00:04:39.094
math track." and they
said, "Well, who are you?"

00:04:39.094 --> 00:04:41.030
(audience laughing)

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:45.266
"I'm her cousin." and, uh,
but you know it's a theme

00:04:45.266 --> 00:04:48.153
that I guess you'll see
many times over the next few

00:04:48.153 --> 00:04:50.475
minutes, but I've seen many
times over the last few

00:04:50.475 --> 00:04:53.177
years starting with Nadia
is that the same girl who

00:04:53.177 --> 00:04:55.746
entering 7th grade thought
she was no good in math

00:04:55.746 --> 00:04:59.421
and thought that she couldn't
comprehend unit conversion,

00:04:59.421 --> 00:05:01.650
by her sophomore year in
high school was taking

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:04.588
Calculus at the local
university and something we're

00:05:04.588 --> 00:05:06.196
going to see over and over
again is that people who

00:05:06.196 --> 00:05:08.058
thought they were bad at
something are able to just

00:05:08.058 --> 00:05:10.325
if they're able to fill in
the gaps in their knowledge

00:05:10.325 --> 00:05:12.989
are able to all of sudden race ahead.

00:05:12.989 --> 00:05:15.597
But I was kind of hooked,
I worked with Nadia then I

00:05:15.597 --> 00:05:19.816
started working with her
younger brothers. Then the

00:05:19.816 --> 00:05:23.682
firm that I was working
for, I use "the firm"

00:05:23.682 --> 00:05:28.085
very broadly, it was my
boss and his dog, we, uh,

00:05:28.085 --> 00:05:31.002
the dog was the chief economist.

00:05:31.002 --> 00:05:33.222
We ended up moving out
to northern California.

00:05:33.222 --> 00:05:37.057
My boss' wife got a job as
a professor at Stanford Law

00:05:37.057 --> 00:05:39.931
and the first Khan
Academy, most people don't

00:05:39.931 --> 00:05:42.109
realize it because the
videos have kind of,

00:05:42.109 --> 00:05:44.159
kind of have a life of their own,

00:05:44.159 --> 00:05:46.410
the first Khan Academy was
actually a little piece

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:49.013
of software that I had
written for my cousins,

00:05:49.013 --> 00:05:50.849
to kind of give them practice
problems. I noticed that

00:05:50.849 --> 00:05:53.241
they didn't, they weren't really
proficient in a lot of things

00:05:53.241 --> 00:05:56.242
that you would expect
someone in 5th or 6th or 7th

00:05:56.242 --> 00:05:58.790
grade to know. I was
somewhat suspicious of

00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:00.525
whether they were doing the
work, so I put a database

00:06:00.525 --> 00:06:06.933
behind it and you fast
forward to 2006. I was at a

00:06:06.933 --> 00:06:10.158
dinner party with a friend
and all my friends knew I

00:06:10.158 --> 00:06:12.025
had this kind of crazy
project with my cousins

00:06:12.025 --> 00:06:14.772
and I was showing off the
software that I had written,

00:06:14.772 --> 00:06:18.039
this things that generate
exercises for them and they

00:06:18.039 --> 00:06:22.677
all knew that I had this
project, but word had gotten

00:06:22.677 --> 00:06:25.679
around in the family that
free tutoring was going on

00:06:25.679 --> 00:06:28.682
and so I found myself now
tutoring every day after

00:06:28.682 --> 00:06:31.477
work about ten or fifteen
cousins and family members

00:06:31.477 --> 00:06:34.522
and whatever else and my friend he's like,

00:06:34.522 --> 00:06:36.270
"Oh Sal, this software is
really cool but how are you

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:39.292
dealing with, you know,
being able to coordinate"

00:06:39.292 --> 00:06:40.734
"all of these tutoring
sessions" and I'm like,

00:06:40.734 --> 00:06:42.936
"You know, it's actually getting
really, really difficult."

00:06:42.936 --> 00:06:45.638
and he's the first person to
tell me, "Well, there's this"

00:06:45.638 --> 00:06:47.350
"YouTube thing. Why
don't you make some of,"

00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:49.400
"Why don't you make videos
of some of your lessons,"

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:50.816
"put them up on YouTube,
maybe your cousins would"

00:06:50.816 --> 00:06:53.797
"find it useful." and I
immediately thought it was a

00:06:53.797 --> 00:06:55.573
horrible idea. I said,
"No, no, no, no, no."

00:06:55.573 --> 00:07:00.280
"YouTube is for cats playing
piano. It's not for serious"

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:04.501
"mathematics.", but I literally
went home that weekend

00:07:04.501 --> 00:07:12.537
got over the idea that it wasn't
my idea and I gave it a shot

00:07:12.537 --> 00:07:15.577
and you know, those first
few videos were kind of on

00:07:15.577 --> 00:07:19.460
algebra and pre-algebra and
whatever else and I made

00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:21.434
about ten or twenty of
them. There were little

00:07:21.434 --> 00:07:24.460
10-minute long videos and I
started telling my cousins,

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:26.672
"Look, if you're confused
about something, you"

00:07:26.672 --> 00:07:30.011
"want to review something,
there's these videos that"

00:07:30.011 --> 00:07:31.467
"are there for you" and
after about a few months,

00:07:31.467 --> 00:07:34.302
I asked for feedback and
you know, they somewhat

00:07:34.302 --> 00:07:37.197
backhandedly told me that
they preferred me on YouTube

00:07:37.197 --> 00:07:42.153
than in person and viewing
the positive angle of that

00:07:42.153 --> 00:07:44.989
feedback, I think it
actually made a lot of sense.

00:07:44.989 --> 00:07:46.926
They were saying look, they
appreciated the time I was

00:07:46.926 --> 00:07:48.920
spending with them. They
appreciated the tutorials,

00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:50.429
but the first time that
you learn something, it's

00:07:50.429 --> 00:07:52.902
stressful to have someone
say, "Oh are are, do you"

00:07:52.902 --> 00:07:55.213
"understand this now?" or a
lot of times, you might be

00:07:55.213 --> 00:07:57.768
in 7th or 8th or 9th grade
and you forgot some concept

00:07:57.768 --> 00:08:00.236
from 4th or 5th grade and
you might be embarrassed

00:08:00.236 --> 00:08:02.749
to tell your cousin and so you
can now review it at your own

00:08:02.749 --> 00:08:05.751
time and pace. When people
coordinate time, you know,

00:08:05.751 --> 00:08:07.520
they might have other things
going on in their day.

00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:08.756
They might have a lot
of homework that night.

00:08:08.756 --> 00:08:10.803
Now they could access the
content when they're ready,

00:08:10.803 --> 00:08:12.357
when they're ready to access it.

00:08:12.357 --> 00:08:15.326
So I view that as positive
feedback and I just kept

00:08:15.326 --> 00:08:18.532
going adding more and more
and more and more content.

00:08:18.532 --> 00:08:21.167
Then it became clear,
soon enough on YouTube,

00:08:21.167 --> 00:08:23.537
that there were people who
were not my cousins who

00:08:23.537 --> 00:08:27.119
were watching and you
know at first the comments

00:08:27.119 --> 00:08:29.453
were just, you know, thank
you, this really helped,

00:08:29.453 --> 00:08:32.244
I really appreciated this
and even that was a pretty

00:08:32.244 --> 00:08:35.245
big deal. I don't know how
much time y'all have spent

00:08:35.245 --> 00:08:37.286
on YouTube, but the
comments don't always be,

00:08:37.286 --> 00:08:38.787
aren't always that positive.

00:08:38.787 --> 00:08:40.844
(audience laughter)

00:08:40.844 --> 00:08:44.870
or even G-rated and then
the comments got really

00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:46.620
interesting. They started
to be things like, you know,

00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:48.702
hey this is the reason why I
was able to go back to college,

00:08:48.702 --> 00:08:51.596
this is the reason why I'm now
a physics major, this is the

00:08:51.596 --> 00:08:54.656
reason why after leaving
the military I can go back

00:08:54.656 --> 00:08:57.710
and major in engineering
and you know, I got crazy

00:08:57.710 --> 00:09:01.294
e-mails. One family said,
"Thank you so much for this"

00:09:01.294 --> 00:09:05.400
"resource. My entire family
prays for your entire family"

00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:07.935
"every evening." and you
have to put things in

00:09:07.935 --> 00:09:11.772
perspective. I was an
analyst at a hedge fund.

00:09:11.772 --> 00:09:13.294
We didn't have a lot of
people praying for us.

00:09:13.294 --> 00:09:15.676
(audience laughing)

00:09:15.676 --> 00:09:17.377
Maybe our investors every now and then.

00:09:17.377 --> 00:09:19.627
(audience laughing)

00:09:19.627 --> 00:09:24.918
So I just kept going and
going and going. In 2008,

00:09:24.918 --> 00:09:27.522
I set it up as a not for profit.
Even at that point, I didn't

00:09:27.522 --> 00:09:30.626
really imagine that it
was, you know my I guess my

00:09:30.626 --> 00:09:33.466
for profit career was going
well and I just assumed

00:09:33.466 --> 00:09:35.968
that hey maybe I'll just
do the for profit thing.

00:09:35.968 --> 00:09:38.613
I'll set this up as a not for
profit. Maybe at some point

00:09:38.613 --> 00:09:40.634
I could get some grants for
it or maybe get a couple

00:09:40.634 --> 00:09:42.800
of people to work on it, but
I didn't really think of that

00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:45.521
as something that might
overtake my life, but then as

00:09:45.521 --> 00:09:48.879
little as a year after that,
2009, it had taken over my life.

00:09:48.879 --> 00:09:51.349
At this point, there were
several hundred thousand

00:09:51.349 --> 00:09:54.182
people who were using the site
every month. I was getting

00:09:54.182 --> 00:09:57.440
hundreds of e-mails every
week. I was sneaking away and

00:09:57.440 --> 00:10:01.130
making videos in every kind
of free time that I had and so

00:10:01.130 --> 00:10:04.499
I sat down with my wife. We
had a little bit of savings.

00:10:04.499 --> 00:10:06.691
Sometimes I'm introduced
as a hedge fund manager

00:10:06.691 --> 00:10:08.690
and I make it very clear now,
I was the analyst. There's a

00:10:08.690 --> 00:10:10.228
different pay grade otherwise
it would have been a much

00:10:10.228 --> 00:10:12.409
easier decision and I would be
dressed a little bit better.

00:10:12.409 --> 00:10:14.783
(audience laughing)

00:10:14.783 --> 00:10:17.970
But I was an analyst and so we
had some savings about enough,

00:10:17.970 --> 00:10:20.277
about a year's worth of
savings, but we didn't own a

00:10:20.277 --> 00:10:24.306
house, our son had just
been born but you know,

00:10:24.306 --> 00:10:26.424
my wife understood that this
is kind of, had overtaken

00:10:26.424 --> 00:10:28.289
my life and I said, "Look,
you know, someone's gotta"

00:10:28.289 --> 00:10:31.063
"appreciate it in the next year."
We'll give ourselves a year,"

00:10:31.063 --> 00:10:32.751
"someone should appreciate
that there's almost"

00:10:32.751 --> 00:10:35.500
"infinite social return on
investment here. That I could"

00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:37.750
"keep on making videos. We
could do the interactive"

00:10:37.750 --> 00:10:40.071
"software, etc., etc. It could
reach millions and millions"

00:10:40.071 --> 00:10:42.642
"and millions, maybe one day
billions of students." and so I

00:10:42.642 --> 00:10:45.499
kind of took that leap of faith and
I think like a lot of entrepreneurial

00:10:45.499 --> 00:10:49.101
stories, you start off very
naively optimistic. You're already

00:10:49.101 --> 00:10:51.433
starting to talk to some
foundations, you just assume

00:10:51.433 --> 00:10:53.583
yeah, this is a no-brainer
for them, they're definitely

00:10:53.583 --> 00:10:57.183
going to fund this and they don't.

00:10:57.183 --> 00:11:00.995
A few months go by and in
all honesty about nine months

00:11:00.995 --> 00:11:04.349
went by and I started getting
pretty insecure and there

00:11:04.349 --> 00:11:06.085
was even a night where I
started literally updating my

00:11:06.085 --> 00:11:09.635
resume and thinking that I
would go back into the world

00:11:09.635 --> 00:11:12.769
that I had come from and
right when I was, right around

00:11:12.769 --> 00:11:15.640
that same time, I had some
... I had a place where

00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:16.974
people could send in donations.

00:11:16.974 --> 00:11:18.554
There was a little PayPal
link and I was getting

00:11:18.554 --> 00:11:21.611
$50 donations, $5 donations
every now and then $100

00:11:21.611 --> 00:11:24.748
donation would come in and
that did help pay the bills,

00:11:24.748 --> 00:11:27.586
but we were digging into our
savings to the tune of about

00:11:27.586 --> 00:11:31.754
5 or $6,000 a month and
right when that was happening

00:11:31.754 --> 00:11:35.472
all of a sudden a $10,000
donation came in and so I

00:11:35.472 --> 00:11:37.274
immediately see who this
is from, her name was

00:11:37.274 --> 00:11:41.999
Ann Doerr. She was based in
Palo Alto. So I immediately

00:11:41.999 --> 00:11:44.329
sent her an e-mail, I said,
you know, "Thank you so much

00:11:44.329 --> 00:11:46.923
"for this very generous
donation. This is the largest"

00:11:46.923 --> 00:11:49.553
"donation that the Khan
Academy has ever received."

00:11:49.553 --> 00:11:51.526
"If we were a physical
school, you would now have a"

00:11:51.526 --> 00:11:53.050
"building now named after you."

00:11:53.050 --> 00:11:54.550
(audience laughing)

00:11:54.550 --> 00:11:57.246
which I've now discovered
is quite inexpensive.

00:11:57.246 --> 00:12:00.234
It gets you a bench at most universities.

00:12:00.234 --> 00:12:02.238
And she immediately
e-mailed me back and said,

00:12:02.238 --> 00:12:06.482
"Well, I'm fascinated by what
you're doing. Let's have lunch."

00:12:06.482 --> 00:12:09.240
and so we literally, I think
it was like a week later,

00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:11.420
we had lunch in downtown
Palo Alto in a little Indian

00:12:11.420 --> 00:12:15.271
buffet restaurant and Ann
said, "Well, you know,"

00:12:15.271 --> 00:12:18.021
"what are you trying to do?
What's your goal?" and I said,

00:12:18.021 --> 00:12:20.003
"Look, when I filled out
the paperwork with the IRS,"

00:12:20.003 --> 00:12:22.253
"they have a little line
that says mission statement"

00:12:22.253 --> 00:12:24.372
"and I said, well I don't
know, a free world-class"

00:12:24.372 --> 00:12:27.209
"education for anyone,
anywhere." and Ann said,

00:12:27.209 --> 00:12:30.630
"Well, that's optimistic.
That's ambitious."

00:12:30.630 --> 00:12:32.699
"How do you plan on
doing that?" and I said,

00:12:32.699 --> 00:12:36.450
"Well, I want to keep making
videos, but I could imagine"

00:12:36.450 --> 00:12:38.386
"building the interactive software
even more, the stuff that"

00:12:38.386 --> 00:12:41.784
"I started making with my
cousins, feedback, dashboards,"

00:12:41.784 --> 00:12:45.327
"tools for teachers, ways for
kids to communicate online,"

00:12:45.327 --> 00:12:47.664
"we can internationalize
it, so anyone on the planet"

00:12:47.664 --> 00:12:50.783
"can possibly access it."
and she said "Well, you know"

00:12:50.783 --> 00:12:53.569
"this is strangely enough,
it seems like your on track"

00:12:53.569 --> 00:12:56.461
"to do this. How are you
supporting yourself?"

00:12:56.461 --> 00:13:00.430
and in as a proud of a way as
possible I said, "I'm not."

00:13:00.430 --> 00:13:01.514
(audience laughing)

00:13:01.514 --> 00:13:05.065
And so Ann kind of nodded
and we parted ways,

00:13:05.065 --> 00:13:09.399
she got on her bicycle, I got
into my car and I drove home

00:13:09.399 --> 00:13:11.314
ten minutes later I'm driving
into the driveway and I got

00:13:11.314 --> 00:13:15.146
a text message from Ann and
it said "you really need"

00:13:15.146 --> 00:13:19.065
"to be supporting yourself.
I've just wired you $100.000."

00:13:19.065 --> 00:13:20.618
So, it was a good day.

00:13:20.618 --> 00:13:24.622
(audience laughing)

00:13:24.622 --> 00:13:27.900
And frankly that was
the beginning of a whole

00:13:27.900 --> 00:13:31.929
cascade of stranger and stranger
events. You fast forward

00:13:31.929 --> 00:13:34.399
two months, I was running,
you know I was like this

00:13:34.399 --> 00:13:36.625
virtual teaching guy and I
was curious what could you

00:13:36.625 --> 00:13:38.458
do with a physical environment
if it's not based on

00:13:38.458 --> 00:13:41.517
lecture anymore and so I
had this little summer camp

00:13:41.517 --> 00:13:45.208
where I had about twenty-five
middle school students

00:13:45.208 --> 00:13:48.491
and I had six of them play a
game of Risk and then I had

00:13:48.491 --> 00:13:50.626
the other, the remainder of the
students trade securities based

00:13:50.626 --> 00:13:54.764
on the outcome of the game
of Risk and one 12-year-old

00:13:54.764 --> 00:13:57.002
actually invented naked
shorting and I told them I could

00:13:57.002 --> 00:13:59.557
introduce them to some people,
they could ... they could

00:13:59.557 --> 00:14:04.390
do quite well. But, while that
was happening I got another

00:14:04.390 --> 00:14:06.807
actually series of text messages
from Ann and at this point

00:14:06.807 --> 00:14:08.544
I take her text messages very seriously.

00:14:08.544 --> 00:14:11.193
(audience laughing)

00:14:11.193 --> 00:14:13.568
They ... they, it was actually
hard to read but it read

00:14:13.568 --> 00:14:17.486
along the lines of "I'm at
the Aspen Ideas Festival right

00:14:17.486 --> 00:14:22.153
now. In the main pavilion.
Bill gates on stage talking

00:14:22.153 --> 00:14:25.261
about Khan Academy last
five minutes" and so I

00:14:25.261 --> 00:14:28.265
immediately boot the nearest
7th grader off of a computer

00:14:28.265 --> 00:14:32.106
and I start looking for
evidence that this, what is Ann

00:14:32.106 --> 00:14:35.152
talking about and I soon found
people tweeting about it.

00:14:35.152 --> 00:14:37.476
I was finding even blog posts
were starting to come out,

00:14:37.476 --> 00:14:39.746
in a few hours I was able to
find actual footage of the

00:14:39.746 --> 00:14:43.786
event and Bill Gates on stage
with Walter Isaacson talking

00:14:43.786 --> 00:14:46.536
about how he uses this thing
called the Khan Academy

00:14:46.536 --> 00:14:50.356
with his kids, he uses it himself
which actually was a little bit

00:14:50.356 --> 00:14:55.022
scary for me. Those videos were
for Nadia, not for Bill Gates.

00:14:55.022 --> 00:14:57.563
(audience laughing)

00:14:57.563 --> 00:14:59.996
And then I went home that
evening kind of just confused

00:14:59.996 --> 00:15:04.067
and not sure what to do
next. I mean, do I call him?

00:15:04.067 --> 00:15:06.638
Do I ... What's the protocol here?

00:15:06.638 --> 00:15:09.340
And they left me in that
somewhat bizarre state for the

00:15:09.340 --> 00:15:13.140
next two weeks and so two weeks
later I'm literally in the

00:15:13.140 --> 00:15:15.148
world headquarters of the
Khan Academy which was our

00:15:15.148 --> 00:15:18.762
walk-in closet and I was making
a video and then all of a

00:15:18.762 --> 00:15:22.211
sudden I get a call from
Seattle. This is intriguing,

00:15:22.211 --> 00:15:26.320
I answer the phone, "Hello."
and on the other side,

00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:29.154
you know, "This is Larry Cohen.
I'm Bill Gates' chief of staff"

00:15:29.154 --> 00:15:30.729
"You might have heard that Bill's a fan."

00:15:30.729 --> 00:15:32.190
"Yeah, I heard that."

00:15:32.190 --> 00:15:33.736
(audience laughing)

00:15:33.736 --> 00:15:35.799
"If you have some time in
the near future, we would"

00:15:35.799 --> 00:15:38.400
"love to fly you up to Seattle
and figure out how we can"

00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:40.904
"support you." and at that
moment I was looking at my

00:15:40.904 --> 00:15:43.808
calendar for the month, completely blank.

00:15:43.808 --> 00:15:45.856
(audience laughing)

00:15:45.856 --> 00:15:47.648
So I said, "Yeah, you know
I gotta cut my nails on"

00:15:47.648 --> 00:15:49.981
"Wednesday, but other than
that I think I can fly up"

00:15:49.981 --> 00:15:51.145
"and meet Bill Gates."

00:15:51.145 --> 00:15:55.152
So all of that worked out,
went and met with Bill Gates.

00:15:55.152 --> 00:15:58.254
They decided to support us,
be able to hire up a team.

00:15:58.254 --> 00:16:00.019
Right around that same
time, we were also meeting

00:16:00.019 --> 00:16:02.265
with the folks at Google. I
mean, all of these things were

00:16:02.265 --> 00:16:03.776
just these independent events
that just came together

00:16:03.776 --> 00:16:07.360
all at once. They also
decided to support us in a

00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:10.357
significant way and about
this time two and a half years

00:16:10.357 --> 00:16:13.109
ago, not that long ago,
we were up and running and

00:16:13.109 --> 00:16:16.026
we were kind of ready to build
what I had first described

00:16:16.026 --> 00:16:19.521
to Ann and what you see
here, this is kind of a,

00:16:19.521 --> 00:16:21.871
I like to show this because
it kind of gives a framework

00:16:21.871 --> 00:16:24.748
for how we think about how
kids can interact and learn

00:16:24.748 --> 00:16:26.982
with the system. This is what
we call our knowledge map.

00:16:26.982 --> 00:16:30.451
Each of those nodes are
concepts in mathematics,

00:16:30.451 --> 00:16:32.702
so you saw the videos.
They go much broader than

00:16:32.702 --> 00:16:34.990
mathematics. Right now
our interactive portion is

00:16:34.990 --> 00:16:37.596
mainly math. Over time, we
hope that the interactive

00:16:37.596 --> 00:16:42.104
will also be in quite possibly
every subject, but what

00:16:42.104 --> 00:16:45.685
you see here is that the higher
you go, there are more basic

00:16:45.685 --> 00:16:47.875
concepts and as students
show proficiency or mastery

00:16:47.875 --> 00:16:51.127
in the more basic concepts,
it then moves them down to

00:16:51.127 --> 00:16:54.293
more advanced concepts and
it's kind of an obvious idea,

00:16:54.293 --> 00:16:56.310
it's how you would play a
video game. You master level

00:16:56.310 --> 00:16:58.378
one, then you go to level
two. That's how you would

00:16:58.378 --> 00:17:00.280
learn a martial art. That's
how you would learn a musical

00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:02.481
instrument, but the thing that
I always point out is this

00:17:02.481 --> 00:17:06.285
is not the way that you are
taught in a traditional classroom.

00:17:06.285 --> 00:17:10.145
In a traditional classroom,
you group kids by age.

00:17:10.145 --> 00:17:13.102
You push them through in
a kind of a assembly line

00:17:13.102 --> 00:17:15.434
factory model and it's actually
no coincidence, this model

00:17:15.434 --> 00:17:19.402
was developed really during
the industrial revolution.

00:17:19.402 --> 00:17:21.644
At different points in time,
usually state mandated, you

00:17:21.644 --> 00:17:24.647
kind of try to apply
information to them. Some kids

00:17:24.647 --> 00:17:27.550
get the information, some
kids don't. Even if a kid gets

00:17:27.550 --> 00:17:31.107
a "C" on say basic exponents,
that's and you identify

00:17:31.107 --> 00:17:33.711
those weaknesses, you move
on to negative exponents

00:17:33.711 --> 00:17:36.014
or fractions or something
more advanced, even though

00:17:36.014 --> 00:17:39.117
you know that they had
weaknesses in something more

00:17:39.117 --> 00:17:41.784
basic and the analogy I
draw there is imagine if you

00:17:41.784 --> 00:17:45.575
were building a house and
you get the contractors and

00:17:45.575 --> 00:17:47.513
you tell the contractors,
"Look, we have ... the state

00:17:47.513 --> 00:17:50.462
tells me we have exactly three
weeks to build this foundation."

00:17:50.462 --> 00:17:53.190
"Do what you can.", so the
contractor does what they can

00:17:53.190 --> 00:17:56.784
You get the inspector to show
up after two, three weeks

00:17:56.784 --> 00:17:58.433
and the inspector says,
"Well, yeah I don't know the"

00:17:58.433 --> 00:18:01.224
"concrete's still a little bit wet
right over there. This part right"

00:18:01.224 --> 00:18:05.824
"over here isn't quite up to
code. I would give it an 85%."

00:18:05.824 --> 00:18:09.990
and you say, "Great, that's a
'C'. Let's build a first floor."

00:18:09.990 --> 00:18:13.281
and you build a first floor,
you know, two weeks of you know

00:18:13.281 --> 00:18:15.227
you tell the contractor, "Look,
you just have to spend two weeks."

00:18:15.227 --> 00:18:17.621
"I don't care if the supplies
don't show up. I don't care"

00:18:17.621 --> 00:18:20.811
"if it rains. Do what you
can." Inspector shows up, 75%.

00:18:20.811 --> 00:18:23.441
"Great, let's build the
second floor" and you do that

00:18:23.441 --> 00:18:25.194
floor after floor after floor
and then all of a sudden while

00:18:25.194 --> 00:18:27.410
you're building the fourth
floor and the whole thing

00:18:27.410 --> 00:18:29.911
collapses, you blame the
contractor. You say, "Oh my

00:18:29.911 --> 00:18:32.066
God, I had a horrible
contractor." or maybe you say,

00:18:32.066 --> 00:18:34.963
"Oh, we didn't inspect good
enough.", but the reality is

00:18:34.963 --> 00:18:38.441
maybe those things were fine,
but the process was broken.

00:18:38.441 --> 00:18:40.510
The inspector was identifying
weaknesses, but you

00:18:40.510 --> 00:18:42.386
completely ignored them
and you moved onto the

00:18:42.386 --> 00:18:44.246
next concept and this is
essentially what's happening

00:18:44.246 --> 00:18:47.391
in our schools every day
and so what we're saying is,

00:18:47.391 --> 00:18:49.971
look, instead of holding fixed
when and how long you have

00:18:49.971 --> 00:18:52.695
to learn something and the
variable is how well you

00:18:52.695 --> 00:18:54.864
learn it pretty much ensuring
that you end up with all of these

00:18:54.864 --> 00:18:56.972
gaps that are going to make
you hit a wall later on in

00:18:56.972 --> 00:19:01.440
your career, let's make the
variable how long you have to

00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:03.477
learn it and when you learn
it essentially personalize the

00:19:03.477 --> 00:19:06.502
instruction for your needs,
but the fixed thing is that

00:19:06.502 --> 00:19:11.534
you have a high-level,
a high-level of mastery.

00:19:11.534 --> 00:19:14.205
Now this is just an example
of what some of these

00:19:14.205 --> 00:19:16.780
exercises look like. I
showed, you know, we mentioned

00:19:16.780 --> 00:19:19.373
that a billion of these
have been done and I like to

00:19:19.373 --> 00:19:21.373
show this one. This is kind of
like montessori for Calculus.

00:19:21.373 --> 00:19:23.588
It kind of shows you that
you can change the slope of

00:19:23.588 --> 00:19:26.455
the tangent line at any point
and by doing that you're

00:19:26.455 --> 00:19:30.873
essentially plotting the derivative.

00:19:30.873 --> 00:19:33.229
You know when I ... When we
started this whole thing,

00:19:33.229 --> 00:19:35.332
I assumed Khan Academy was
just going to be this thing

00:19:35.332 --> 00:19:38.205
outside of classrooms. You
know, the school system

00:19:38.205 --> 00:19:40.955
was this beaurueacratic thing
with a lot of inertia, but

00:19:40.955 --> 00:19:42.707
right when we got some of
that first funding, a local

00:19:42.707 --> 00:19:45.440
school district reached out
to us, Los Altos, and said,

00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:47.191
"Look, what would you do
with a 5th grade classroom,"

00:19:47.191 --> 00:19:49.747
"now with your tools?" and we
said, "Look, we don't think"

00:19:49.747 --> 00:19:52.073
"there's a reason to use
class time for this passive"

00:19:52.073 --> 00:19:54.691
"one size fits all lecture.
Like, students can get it"

00:19:54.691 --> 00:19:56.634
"On Demand". I told them
how my cousins liked that

00:19:56.634 --> 00:19:59.322
even more and we can
use class time for more

00:19:59.322 --> 00:20:01.822
valuable things, for
interacting with the teacher,

00:20:01.822 --> 00:20:04.655
for peer to peer instruction.
The irony here is if the kids

00:20:04.655 --> 00:20:07.573
can learn at their own time
and pace when they're not

00:20:07.573 --> 00:20:09.406
in the classroom, the
classroom could become a more

00:20:09.406 --> 00:20:13.489
human experience because
they had this technology

00:20:13.489 --> 00:20:16.062
and somewhat surprising to us, they said,

00:20:16.062 --> 00:20:18.717
"Yeah, this is exactly
consistent with differnentiated

00:20:18.717 --> 00:20:21.118
instruction, mastery based
learning, these concepts

00:20:21.118 --> 00:20:23.098
that have been in education
circles forever and we want

00:20:23.098 --> 00:20:27.342
to do it." So, we started a
pilot and what you see here is

00:20:27.342 --> 00:20:29.762
some of the dashboards
from that initial pilot and

00:20:29.762 --> 00:20:32.522
it gives you an idea how
these classrooms could work.

00:20:32.553 --> 00:20:34.684
So each row is kind of like
a spreadsheet, each row there

00:20:34.684 --> 00:20:38.189
is a student in the class.
Each of those columns is one

00:20:38.189 --> 00:20:40.390
of those concepts you saw
in that knowledge map.

00:20:40.390 --> 00:20:42.626
Green means that a student is
proficient. Blue means that

00:20:42.626 --> 00:20:44.942
they're working on it and
red means that a student is

00:20:44.942 --> 00:20:47.444
stuck on it and the model
is the teacher can walk

00:20:47.444 --> 00:20:49.614
around, it literally updates
in real time. It shows up on

00:20:49.614 --> 00:20:52.229
their tablet and they can
say, "Okay, that student is

00:20:52.229 --> 00:20:54.552
having trouble with exponents
3. There's a couple of

00:20:54.552 --> 00:20:56.954
students who have already
mastered that, maybe I can set up

00:20:56.954 --> 00:20:59.003
a little peer tutoring between
them or if they're still

00:20:59.003 --> 00:21:00.858
having trouble, maybe I
can sit down and do a very

00:21:00.858 --> 00:21:03.360
focused intervention or
maybe if a bunch of students

00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:05.874
have already mastered a certain
concept, I can now do more

00:21:05.874 --> 00:21:12.941
interactive maybe a project based
on, based on that type of a concept.

00:21:12.941 --> 00:21:15.485
This next chart or graph,
I mean we have a ton of

00:21:15.485 --> 00:21:17.211
dashboards for teachers, so
that we can really give them

00:21:17.211 --> 00:21:19.346
the type of analytics, frankly
the type of analytics that

00:21:19.346 --> 00:21:21.450
we were seeing before in the
marketing analytics or the

00:21:21.450 --> 00:21:23.718
type of analytics that I had
when I was an analyst at a

00:21:23.718 --> 00:21:25.955
hedge fund, we can finally give
that to a teacher so they can

00:21:25.955 --> 00:21:28.972
in real time slice and dice
what all other students are up

00:21:28.972 --> 00:21:32.589
to, but I like to show this
one because above and beyond

00:21:32.589 --> 00:21:35.589
to showing a report, it talks
about a very powerful narrative,

00:21:35.589 --> 00:21:37.674
essentially the same narrative
that I had first seen

00:21:37.674 --> 00:21:40.638
with Nadia. The horizontal
axis there is just time.

00:21:40.638 --> 00:21:44.339
It's just days on the site. The
vertical axis is just a count

00:21:44.339 --> 00:21:47.090
of how many of those
modules a student has shown

00:21:47.090 --> 00:21:50.146
proficiency in and each of
those lines is a student in a

00:21:50.146 --> 00:21:53.816
classroom and what you
see is, just like any math

00:21:53.816 --> 00:21:56.090
classroom, right when you
start there's a group of kids

00:21:56.090 --> 00:21:58.454
very steep slope, they
start advancing really fast.

00:21:58.454 --> 00:22:00.535
There's a group of kids in
the middle and then there's

00:22:00.535 --> 00:22:02.668
a group of kids who are really
slow to start, those are

00:22:02.668 --> 00:22:05.709
the flatter lines and in a
traditional model, you say oh

00:22:05.709 --> 00:22:08.777
those kids who are racing
ahead, those are the honors

00:22:08.777 --> 00:22:10.998
students. Those are the kids
who are, you know, gonna go to

00:22:10.998 --> 00:22:13.635
to college, become engineers
and doctors and all the rest.

00:22:13.635 --> 00:22:16.312
We have the kids in the middle
and there are kids, the slow

00:22:16.312 --> 00:22:19.473
kids. Maybe those kids are the
remedial students, but what

00:22:19.473 --> 00:22:21.584
we're seeing is if you let
every student learn at their own

00:22:21.584 --> 00:22:25.166
pace, if you let them fill in
the gaps that you thought that

00:22:25.166 --> 00:22:27.461
they weren't able to fill in
before. The same students that

00:22:27.461 --> 00:22:32.056
we thought were remedial
ten days into the process or

00:22:32.056 --> 00:22:34.250
mediocre ten days in the
process and this blue student

00:22:34.250 --> 00:22:36.498
is one of them and it actually
clips off a little bit on the right,

00:22:36.498 --> 00:22:40.489
but on the right it, even at
day 70-something you see that

00:22:40.489 --> 00:22:42.477
there's a third best student,
but this student actually ends up

00:22:42.477 --> 00:22:44.859
becoming the second best
student in the class and we're

00:22:44.859 --> 00:22:46.965
seeing this over and over
and over again in every

00:22:46.965 --> 00:22:49.009
classroom that we've worked
with, whether we're talking

00:22:49.009 --> 00:22:51.971
about public schools, private
schools, rich neighborhoods,

00:22:51.971 --> 00:22:54.629
poor neighborhoods, where
ever it is many of the kids

00:22:54.629 --> 00:22:57.357
that even in the two months
that you thought were slow,

00:22:57.357 --> 00:23:00.346
you thought were remedial,
you let them fill in that gap

00:23:00.346 --> 00:23:01.312
even though it's in algebra
class, you let them make sure

00:23:01.312 --> 00:23:03.167
they know their multiplication
tables, know they're

00:23:03.167 --> 00:23:06.375
multiplying decimals, adding
fractions, negative numbers,

00:23:06.375 --> 00:23:08.339
they can become the best
student in the class.

00:23:08.339 --> 00:23:21.500
(audience applauding)

00:23:21.500 --> 00:23:23.872
Right now, 20,000 classrooms
are using us in some

00:23:23.872 --> 00:23:26.134
way shape or form. I want to
make it clear, all of this is

00:23:26.134 --> 00:23:28.743
completely free, it's not for
profit. All these dashboards that

00:23:28.743 --> 00:23:31.120
I'm showing you, you could start
using it with your cousins,

00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:33.888
you can volunteer at your local
boys and girls club or your

00:23:33.888 --> 00:23:36.317
local school and you can be the
coach and you would have the

00:23:36.317 --> 00:23:40.112
same tools that the teachers
in Los Altos have, but with

00:23:40.112 --> 00:23:42.758
that we like to remind ourselves
that still the bulk of our

00:23:42.758 --> 00:23:45.528
users even though we have
400,000 in classrooms, the bulk

00:23:45.528 --> 00:23:50.067
of our users, the other 5,500,000
are just people out there

00:23:50.067 --> 00:23:53.670
just trying to tap into their
potential and what this next

00:23:53.670 --> 00:23:56.327
video at least shows us and
hopefully shows you as well,

00:23:56.327 --> 00:23:59.431
is just how much potential there
is out in the world if we just give

00:23:59.431 --> 00:24:04.362
people the tools to actually tap into it.

00:24:04.362 --> 00:24:07.947
Mark: My name is Mark Halverstedt.
Growing up, I was really

00:24:07.947 --> 00:24:11.976
always a "C" student. I think
I was really pretty much always

00:24:11.976 --> 00:24:15.168
pretty pitiful in school. I
don't think I've ever gotten

00:24:15.168 --> 00:24:19.820
higher than a B+ in any math
class ever particularly.

00:24:19.820 --> 00:24:21.919
I pretty much thought that
the only thing I was good

00:24:21.919 --> 00:24:26.192
enough to do in college was
major in music and I went off

00:24:26.192 --> 00:24:30.128
and I got a music degree
in saxophone, but I sort of

00:24:30.128 --> 00:24:33.684
almost felt that it was more
I was getting it because I

00:24:33.684 --> 00:24:37.500
was terrible at everything
else. I worked as a saxophone

00:24:37.500 --> 00:24:41.683
player for a few years, really
what I wanted to do was do

00:24:41.683 --> 00:24:44.600
electrical engineering and
the last thing that I remember

00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:48.382
completely not getting was
trig identities. So, I went to

00:24:48.382 --> 00:24:52.262
YouTube and I did a search
for trig identities and Khan

00:24:52.262 --> 00:24:55.154
Academy was the first thing
that popped up. I watched a

00:24:55.154 --> 00:24:57.356
bunch of videos in the trig
playlist to kind of get caught up to

00:24:57.356 --> 00:25:00.826
speed. I watched all of the
videos in the calculus playlist.

00:25:00.826 --> 00:25:03.523
I watched all the videos in
the physics playlist. I watched

00:25:03.523 --> 00:25:07.236
a bunch of videos on dividing
decimals and even on a

00:25:07.236 --> 00:25:11.240
subtraction by borrowing. I
watched a lot of videos on

00:25:11.240 --> 00:25:16.311
arithmetic. That was in 2007.
I did that until the fall

00:25:16.311 --> 00:25:21.164
of 2010 and then in the fall
2010, I took a leap. I decided

00:25:21.164 --> 00:25:25.330
to go back to school and
went to Temple University,

00:25:25.330 --> 00:25:29.163
majored in electrical engineering
getting a second bachelors

00:25:29.163 --> 00:25:31.961
and keep in mind, I don't
think I've ever gotten above a

00:25:31.961 --> 00:25:37.498
B+ in math classes and I was
really a straight "C" student

00:25:37.498 --> 00:25:41.058
growing up and I just finished
this year, first year back

00:25:41.058 --> 00:25:46.107
in college, I got a 4.0 GPA for
the entire year. I got perfect

00:25:46.107 --> 00:25:50.386
scores on both of my Calc
final exams and also on

00:25:50.386 --> 00:25:55.859
my Chemistry final exams. I
ended Calculus, Chemistry,

00:25:55.859 --> 00:25:58.860
both Calculus classes, Calc I
and II and Chemistry with an

00:25:58.860 --> 00:26:03.584
average higher than 100%.
There are some Khan Academy

00:26:03.584 --> 00:26:07.309
videos that I probably
listened to the same concept

00:26:07.309 --> 00:26:13.822
over twenty or thirty times
and there is no tutor in the

00:26:13.822 --> 00:26:17.323
world I could have paid
to have sat next to me and

00:26:17.323 --> 00:26:21.204
repeated the same thing
over twenty or thirty times

00:26:21.204 --> 00:26:24.157
without at least them getting
a little bit judgmental

00:26:24.157 --> 00:26:27.289
or at least them thinking like
oh, well this guy really is never

00:26:27.289 --> 00:26:30.228
going to get this concept
and he should just give up.

00:26:30.228 --> 00:26:32.762
Where the understanding
really happened was watching

00:26:32.762 --> 00:26:35.666
those videos and also working
through the Khan Academy

00:26:35.666 --> 00:26:38.835
software and everything. The
impact for me in my life,

00:26:38.835 --> 00:26:43.004
I really see it growing
exponentially over the next twenty

00:26:43.004 --> 00:26:47.376
or thirty years. So from the
bottom of my heart, thank you.

00:26:47.376 --> 00:26:50.644
(audience applauding)

00:26:50.644 --> 00:26:54.012
And Mark is now a junior
and still has a 4.0 GPA,

00:26:54.012 --> 00:26:56.011
so he's doing quite well.
Maybe he'll apply for an

00:26:56.011 --> 00:26:59.788
internship with some of you
guys, so keep a look out.

00:26:59.788 --> 00:27:02.344
So the one thing that might,
some of y'all might have been

00:27:02.344 --> 00:27:04.057
thinking about and I even
saw that map where some of

00:27:04.057 --> 00:27:05.761
y'all are from is everything
that I've been focused on so

00:27:05.761 --> 00:27:08.843
far has been the English
speaking world, the developed

00:27:08.843 --> 00:27:11.300
world, but the implications
on the developing world

00:27:11.300 --> 00:27:15.008
could be even larger where
you have lack of resources or

00:27:15.008 --> 00:27:16.674
even if you have the resources,
you might not be able to

00:27:16.674 --> 00:27:19.334
find teachers where the kids
have all sorts of, they're all at

00:27:19.334 --> 00:27:22.850
different types of skill levels
and so we've started to have

00:27:22.850 --> 00:27:26.185
other groups take what we're
doing, other not for profits,

00:27:26.185 --> 00:27:28.829
for the most part but even
some governments, take our

00:27:28.829 --> 00:27:31.233
stuff and start to deploy it
all over the world and these

00:27:31.233 --> 00:27:33.768
are pictures of Khan Academy
being used in various

00:27:33.768 --> 00:27:36.167
parts of the world and each
of these are exciting stories.

00:27:36.167 --> 00:27:38.772
But the one for us that's
kind of been the most mind

00:27:38.772 --> 00:27:41.500
blowing is the one up there
in the top right. You know,

00:27:41.500 --> 00:27:43.834
I used to give talks like
this about a year ago and say

00:27:43.834 --> 00:27:48.348
one day, this might be used
in Mongolia and about a little

00:27:48.348 --> 00:27:50.717
after that I got an e-mail
from Mongolia. It was actually

00:27:50.717 --> 00:27:53.579
from Zaya, the girl on the top
right and she actually sent

00:27:53.579 --> 00:27:55.935
a YouTube thank you not too
different than what you saw from

00:27:55.935 --> 00:27:58.908
Mark Halberstadt and I
assumed she must be a middle-

00:27:58.908 --> 00:28:02.798
class girl. She has access
to YouTube and whatever else,

00:28:02.798 --> 00:28:05.381
but then I read the e-mail in
more depth and it turned out

00:28:05.381 --> 00:28:08.005
that there was a group from
Silicon Valley who in their

00:28:08.005 --> 00:28:11.819
vacation time, a group of
engineers was going to Mongolia

00:28:11.819 --> 00:28:16.385
and setting up a kind of a
computer labs in orphanages

00:28:16.385 --> 00:28:20.359
and what you see there the
top right, those are girls

00:28:20.359 --> 00:28:24.053
in a Mongolian orphanage
using Khan Academy and Zaya

00:28:24.053 --> 00:28:28.385
was one of the orphans and
that by itself was cool enough

00:28:28.385 --> 00:28:31.877
but then Zaya herself who is
now 17 and got so into it,

00:28:31.877 --> 00:28:34.681
that she's our now, she's
now, this is a 17-year-old

00:28:34.681 --> 00:28:37.553
orphan girl is now our prime
producer of content in the

00:28:37.553 --> 00:28:39.786
Mongolian language. She is
essentially the teacher for

00:28:39.786 --> 00:28:42.858
her country and so it's kind
of one of these surreal,

00:28:42.858 --> 00:28:45.995
sci-fi type of things and so
what I want to show you now

00:28:45.995 --> 00:28:49.156
is the direction we're going in,
in terms of internationalization.

00:28:49.156 --> 00:28:52.273
We have 4,000 videos in
English. We now have 7,000

00:28:52.273 --> 00:28:54.862
in, I think, twenty languages
and our goal is to frankly have

00:28:54.862 --> 00:28:58.519
80,000 in twenty languages
and maybe more and maybe

00:28:58.519 --> 00:29:01.094
even have regional specific
content and so this next

00:29:01.094 --> 00:29:04.436
montage shows you a little
taste of what those other

00:29:04.436 --> 00:29:06.187
videos look like and they're
already available on the

00:29:06.187 --> 00:29:08.807
site, if you, at the bottom
there's a little bit of a drop down

00:29:08.807 --> 00:29:14.808
and it ends with a little
part of Zaya's original video.

00:29:50.605 --> 00:29:55.321
Zaya: I'm Zaya from
Mongolia. Your videos are so

00:29:55.321 --> 00:30:02.554
interesting and funny. Make more lessons.

00:30:02.554 --> 00:30:06.968
I watch that, I watch
that when I get lazy.

00:30:06.968 --> 00:30:12.864
(audience applauding)

00:30:12.864 --> 00:30:15.268
So I like to point out, I
mean you know it started with

00:30:15.268 --> 00:30:18.203
me and my cousins, but I like
to emphasize that it's not

00:30:18.203 --> 00:30:21.274
just me anymore. It's a team
of folks. We're approaching

00:30:21.274 --> 00:30:24.276
40 people and I like to
emphasize I think we're in a

00:30:24.276 --> 00:30:26.905
special time in history,
literally, a Gutenberg moment,

00:30:26.905 --> 00:30:28.905
not even a once in a lifetime
opportunity. I literally think

00:30:28.905 --> 00:30:32.018
it's a once in a millenia
opportunity where you could have

00:30:32.018 --> 00:30:34.881
real reach and real scale
and what I point out is,

00:30:34.881 --> 00:30:37.423
you know, our team over
the last year averaged 24

00:30:37.423 --> 00:30:39.826
employees. We've been
growing quite fast, but we've

00:30:39.826 --> 00:30:42.328
been able to reach 43
million unique students over

00:30:42.328 --> 00:30:44.785
the past year and I point
out that if that was actually

00:30:44.785 --> 00:30:47.067
drawn to scale, that second bar should be

00:30:47.083 --> 00:30:50.974
20 kilometers high.

00:30:50.974 --> 00:30:54.568
So, you know, big picture,
the original tagline on that

00:30:54.568 --> 00:30:58.377
was just the necessities, but there was a.

00:30:58.377 --> 00:31:00.717
You know, big picture,
education has traditionally

00:31:00.717 --> 00:31:03.760
viewed as a very scarce thing,
a thing that's expensive,

00:31:03.760 --> 00:31:06.095
a thing that really differentiates
between the haves and

00:31:06.095 --> 00:31:09.058
have nots, even when people
did philanthropy, it was

00:31:09.058 --> 00:31:11.127
always what do the rich
have? Well, that's expensive.

00:31:11.127 --> 00:31:13.509
Let's create a cheaper
approximation of it and let's try

00:31:13.509 --> 00:31:15.163
to give it to the poor because
they had nothing before

00:31:15.163 --> 00:31:17.839
so it's better than nothing,
but what's exciting now is

00:31:17.839 --> 00:31:20.508
I think we're entering a
reality where we don't even have

00:31:20.508 --> 00:31:23.426
to give the poor a cheaper
approximation. We can give

00:31:23.426 --> 00:31:26.694
students like Zaya and the
other girls in her orphanage

00:31:26.694 --> 00:31:29.839
the exact same thing that
Bill Gates' children have, so

00:31:29.839 --> 00:31:31.546
we're going into a world
where education isn't this

00:31:31.546 --> 00:31:34.951
scarce thing, isn't this
expensive thing so ten, twenty

00:31:34.951 --> 00:31:38.837
thirty years in the future, I
firmly believe that it will be

00:31:38.837 --> 00:31:41.062
viewed as a human right and it
will be viewed as just one of

00:31:41.062 --> 00:31:44.400
these necessitites like clean
drinking water, shelter or

00:31:44.400 --> 00:31:48.105
electricity and with that I'd
just like to thank you for

00:31:48.105 --> 00:31:50.211
having us here. Thanks a bunch.

00:31:50.211 --> 00:31:56.977
(audience applauding)

00:31:56.977 --> 00:32:04.318
Male: Wow.

00:32:04.318 --> 00:32:11.659
(audience applauding)

00:32:11.659 --> 00:32:19.000
Khan: Thanks.
