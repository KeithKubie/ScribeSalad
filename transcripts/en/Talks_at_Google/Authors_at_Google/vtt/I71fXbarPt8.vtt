[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:07.712 --> 00:00:09.790
LOGAN URY: My
name's still Logan.

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:12.610
And I still started this
series a few years ago.

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:16.750
And I write, and
read, and research

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:18.190
dating and relationships.

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:21.070
And it's my pleasure to bring
Eli Finkel here with you

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:24.350
today for this special edition
of Talks at Google Modern

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:24.850
Romance.

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:27.050
So Eli, you thank you
so much for coming.

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.970
ELI FINKEL: Thank
you for having me.

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:28.636
LOGAN URY: Yeah.

00:00:28.636 --> 00:00:31.060
So Eli is a professor
at Northwestern.

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:34.450
And he is the author of a new
book called "The All-or-Nothing

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:35.350
Marriage."

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:37.660
He has appointments in
the psychology department

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:39.790
and the Kellogg
School of Management.

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:42.430
He's the director of
Northwestern's Relationships

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:43.540
and Motivation Lab.

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:47.290
And he has published over
130 scientific articles,

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:49.570
and is a frequent contributor
to "The New York Times."

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:53.004
So everybody, please
welcome Eli Finkel.

00:00:53.004 --> 00:00:55.365
ELI FINKEL: Thank you.

00:00:55.365 --> 00:00:57.490
LOGAN URY: So for those of
you who are lucky enough

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:00.160
to get one of the
first 15 signed books,

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.088
Eli will be signing those
copies for you at the end

00:01:03.088 --> 00:01:04.629
if you want to get
them personalized.

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:07.960
And we'll also save 15 minutes
at the end for questions

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:09.270
from the audience.

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:10.900
OK, let's kick it off.

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:13.660
Eli, before we jump
into your new book,

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:16.330
I'd love to ask you about
your research on dating

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:17.519
and attraction.

00:01:17.519 --> 00:01:19.810
I'm sure we have quite a few
people in the audience who

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:21.400
are looking for love.

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.839
What have you discovered
about online dating?

00:01:23.839 --> 00:01:25.880
ELI FINKEL: Oh, we've done
a lot of work on this.

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:27.796
We tried to figure out
the extent to which you

00:01:27.796 --> 00:01:30.010
can actually tell from
a profile who's going

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:31.450
to be compatible with you.

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:34.910
We've done a lot of work trying
to investigate whether anybody

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:37.060
has developed an algorithm
that actually works,

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:38.810
that can actually set
you up with somebody

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:40.146
who's compatible with you.

00:01:40.146 --> 00:01:41.770
Ultimately, we ended
up being skeptical

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:42.980
about both of those things.

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:45.040
And so we're one of
the few that, I think,

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:48.550
are really enthusiastic
about things like Tinder.

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:50.740
And the reason why is because
online dating is never

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:52.614
going to be able to do
much more for you than

00:01:52.614 --> 00:01:55.690
get you a broader pool
of potential partners

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:58.540
and provide the opportunity
to get across a cup of coffee

00:01:58.540 --> 00:01:59.830
or a pint of beer.

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:02.830
And that's the way you can
assess whether you're actually

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:03.869
compatible with someone.

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.410
LOGAN URY: So based
on your research,

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:08.789
how would you design
the ideal dating app?

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.259
ELI FINKEL: I think
I would make it

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.910
so that it just didn't
make any claims,

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.499
any promises, it didn't
claim, we can find your soul

00:02:16.499 --> 00:02:17.040
mate for you.

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.665
I mean, this was something that
all the online dating companies

00:02:19.665 --> 00:02:21.977
were doing when I first
started looking at this stuff.

00:02:21.977 --> 00:02:24.060
We have an algorithm that
can find your soul-mate.

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.699
Or come on, and spend 20
hours browsing profiles

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:28.740
to see who is compatible.

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:32.010
And that's why I would be very
minimalist about the thing.

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.310
I would just give some sort
of relatively straightforward

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:36.780
interface that people can use.

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.780
And I love the idea that you
can add some spontaneity back

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:42.270
into the way you date.

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:45.600
Tinder and its ilk are a little
bit unfortunate in the way

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.165
that they prioritize
physical attractiveness.

00:02:48.165 --> 00:02:51.175
It's literally like a face that
you swipe left or right on.

00:02:51.175 --> 00:02:52.050
So that's a downside.

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.560
LOGAN URY: I'm familiar with it.

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.435
ELI FINKEL: Yes, you're
familiar with Tinder.

00:02:54.435 --> 00:02:56.670
Yes, most of us are,
I think, these days.

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.112
But something that's
generally in that space that's

00:02:59.112 --> 00:03:00.570
sort of quick, and
dirty, and easy,

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:02.070
and that gets you
face-to-face fast,

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:04.570
that's the optimal online
dating app, I think.

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:06.900
LOGAN URY: Anything about
photos, versus videos,

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.670
using pictures that
make you look better

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:09.780
than you do in real life.

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:10.830
ELI FINKEL: Oh, yeah,
you should definitely

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:12.204
use pictures that
make you better

00:03:12.204 --> 00:03:15.420
than you do in real
life, highly recommended.

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.252
So one of the ideas that
I've been exploring--

00:03:18.252 --> 00:03:19.710
but we don't have
the data on yet--

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:24.030
is, is the extent to which
we can make profile browsing

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:25.890
or something like
that approximate

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:26.930
a real-life interaction.

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:28.800
Because to the degree
that you can do that,

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:33.400
to the degree that you can
make the browsing process,

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.070
figuring out who's
compatible with you,

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:37.470
approximate what it's
like to be face-to-face

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:39.900
with somebody that you
actually might want to meet,

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:42.570
that might mean you can
bypass the obligation

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:45.160
to meet face-to-face.

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.220
Whether there's any
site that can actually

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:51.480
crack this problem,
it's not clear yet.

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:54.090
But I kind of like
the idea that there

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:56.640
might be an algorithm that
somebody could potentially

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:58.080
invent--

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:59.700
I've proposed this idea before--

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:00.380
that would--

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:01.710
LOGAN URY: We are at the
home of algorithms, so.

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:03.584
ELI FINKEL: We are at
the home of algorithms,

00:04:03.584 --> 00:04:04.980
for better and for worse.

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:08.280
So there may be a way
that we can leverage

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:11.190
the latest social science
and the latest technology

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:12.739
to develop an
algorithm that's not

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:14.280
going to find your
soul-mate for you,

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.970
but that can increase,
by 5% or 10%, the odds

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:18.720
that, when you meet
somebody face-to-face,

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.860
you want to go on a second
date with that person.

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:22.840
And I think it resides
at the intersection

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:26.850
of these sorts of non-conscious
behavioral dynamics

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:29.260
that we tend to have in
face-to-face interaction.

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.800
For example, when we really
are attracted to somebody,

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:34.770
when we like somebody, we
non-consciously mimic them,

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:37.400
not in a awkward way,
but in a sort of--

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:39.450
not in that sort of way.

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:43.320
And it's possible that we can
capture those sorts of features

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:46.110
and bring them into a potential
matchmaking algorithm.

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:48.682
But we're certainly ahead of
where the industry is now.

00:04:48.682 --> 00:04:49.390
LOGAN URY: Great.

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:51.044
So it sounds like,
just to summarize,

00:04:51.044 --> 00:04:52.460
something that's
good about Tinder

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:54.210
is that you just have
access to a lot of people

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:55.334
and you can decide quickly.

00:04:55.334 --> 00:04:58.327
But maybe if there was
an element of video,

00:04:58.327 --> 00:05:00.160
or you could get a sense
for them, or even--

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:03.510
do you know this research from
our friend, Dan Ariely, about--

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:06.060
I think it was MIT
students went on a date

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:08.940
where they both entered
this online digital museum.

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:11.090
And they reacted
to pieces of art.

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:12.780
And that tended to
be a good predictor

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:14.240
for if they liked each other.

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:15.698
ELI FINKEL: Yeah,
I love that work.

00:05:15.698 --> 00:05:20.327
So the idea here is that the
problem with profile browsing

00:05:20.327 --> 00:05:22.410
and trying to figure out
who's compatible with you

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:27.870
from a computer
screen or an app is

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:30.640
you're able to search
on various qualities,

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:33.360
how tall somebody is, how
old somebody is, maybe

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:35.720
how much money somebody
makes, maybe a body shape.

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:37.770
But really what
matters are things

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:39.239
that you can't search for.

00:05:39.239 --> 00:05:41.280
They're things that Dan
Ariely and his colleagues

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:43.380
have called experiential
attributes, things

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:45.900
like rapport, things like
sexual compatibility.

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:49.560
Like, I want to find the
profile that will tell me

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:52.590
whether I'm going to have
unique sexual compatibility

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:54.970
or unique rapport
with an individual.

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:57.750
And so those sorts of
approaches, I think

00:05:57.750 --> 00:05:58.530
are intriguing.

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:01.350
To my knowledge, no
mainstream online dating site

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:03.120
has really tried
to leverage them.

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:05.700
LOGAN URY: OK, well, maybe
we'll spark some interest today.

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:08.820
So let's move on to your book,
"The All-or-Nothing Marriage."

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:10.110
What does the title mean?

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:13.992
And why have the stakes for
marriage become all-or-nothing?

00:06:13.992 --> 00:06:15.700
ELI FINKEL: "The
All-or-Nothing Marriage"

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:18.170
isn't about one
marriage, in particular.

00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:21.160
It's about the era of marriage
that we're in right now.

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:26.090
The idea is that we have arrived
at a period in marriage--

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:29.030
particularly, marriage
in America, so 2017--

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:33.430
where the best marriages are
better than the best marriages

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:35.740
of earlier eras, while
at the same time,

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:37.900
the average marriage is
getting a little bit worse.

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:40.060
And so this is the idea
of the all marriage,

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:43.330
those particularly strong
marriages, stronger than,

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:47.950
really, what we had seen in
any other era that I know of.

00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:49.955
So we have those particularly
strong marriages.

00:06:49.955 --> 00:06:52.330
And at the same time, the
average marriage is struggling.

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:54.722
So that's the idea of the
all or the nothing marriage.

00:06:54.722 --> 00:06:55.430
LOGAN URY: Great.

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:57.670
And at one point, you
write that "marriage

00:06:57.670 --> 00:07:00.760
has gone from till death
do us part to today's

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:04.130
till death do us part or
we become unfulfilled."

00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:06.490
Are our expectations
for marriage too high?

00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:07.967
And are we bound for failure?

00:07:07.967 --> 00:07:10.050
ELI FINKEL: I am delighted
that you asked me this.

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:13.030
So this is a big topic.

00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:14.812
And there's no
shortage of people

00:07:14.812 --> 00:07:16.270
willing to chime
in on the question

00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:17.950
of whether our
expectations for marriage

00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:21.010
are too high, whether we
should, in fact, lower them.

00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:24.250
My perspective on this
is that you can't answer

00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:26.230
that question in isolation.

00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:28.870
The right question is
not, are your expectations

00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:30.150
too high or too low?

00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:32.140
But are your
expectations calibrated

00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:35.440
for what the marriage
realistically can provide?

00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:38.920
And so I don't have this, I
think, skeptical or cynical

00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:40.990
view that says we're
asking too much.

00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:44.380
Because it's primarily
because of how much

00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:46.480
we're asking of
our marriage that

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:49.330
makes having a pretty
spectacular marriage something

00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:50.920
that's within reach
today to a degree

00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:53.680
that it would have been
out of reach in the past.

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:55.730
And so these expectations
can be great.

00:07:55.730 --> 00:07:58.582
The problem is, when you have
these sorts of expectations,

00:07:58.582 --> 00:08:00.040
you might end up
in a marriage that

00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:02.350
would have been totally
fulfilling for you in 1950

00:08:02.350 --> 00:08:03.490
and falls short now.

00:08:03.490 --> 00:08:04.930
And you end up disappointed.

00:08:04.930 --> 00:08:07.324
So again, the idea isn't
about whether the expectations

00:08:07.324 --> 00:08:07.990
are high or low.

00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:09.730
The idea is whether
the expectations

00:08:09.730 --> 00:08:11.890
are appropriately
tailored in light

00:08:11.890 --> 00:08:14.290
of what I'm like, what
you're like, the dynamics

00:08:14.290 --> 00:08:15.910
that the two of
us have together.

00:08:15.910 --> 00:08:19.660
And those of us who have high
expectations and the marriage

00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:23.450
fulfills those expectations,
it's pretty great.

00:08:23.450 --> 00:08:25.910
LOGAN URY: So speaking
of changing expectations,

00:08:25.910 --> 00:08:28.030
one of my favorite
concepts from your book

00:08:28.030 --> 00:08:31.240
is the concept of the
Michelangelo effect.

00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:33.880
Will you explain what it is
and how it effects are changing

00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:35.018
expectations of marriage?

00:08:35.018 --> 00:08:36.309
ELI FINKEL: I do love this one.

00:08:36.309 --> 00:08:40.030
So my doctoral mentor, a
woman named Caryl Rusbult,

00:08:40.030 --> 00:08:44.350
a social psychologist, she
developed this metaphor

00:08:44.350 --> 00:08:47.260
for thinking about how
relationships work.

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:50.830
And she borrowed an
idea from Michelangelo,

00:08:50.830 --> 00:08:54.092
the famous Renaissance sculptor.

00:08:54.092 --> 00:08:56.050
And he talked about
sculpting-- and some of you

00:08:56.050 --> 00:08:57.508
might know this
already-- he talked

00:08:57.508 --> 00:09:00.190
about sculpting not as a
process of creating a sculpture,

00:09:00.190 --> 00:09:02.800
but as a process of
revealing a sculpture.

00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:04.660
And this is, obviously,
profoundly modest.

00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:06.010
But in a real sense, it's true.

00:09:06.010 --> 00:09:07.930
There was some massive
piece of marble.

00:09:07.930 --> 00:09:08.830
And he chiseled.

00:09:08.830 --> 00:09:09.580
And he scraped.

00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:11.950
Any buffed until
there was a David.

00:09:11.950 --> 00:09:16.240
And the idea is
all of us have what

00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:19.510
you might call the actual
self, the person we are today.

00:09:19.510 --> 00:09:21.220
But all of us also
have an ideal self.

00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:24.640
There's a better version
of us nested within us.

00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:27.640
There's an aspirational
version, who's

00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:30.170
better about being disciplined
in goal pursuit, who

00:09:30.170 --> 00:09:32.295
is kinder to other people,
who is more patient,

00:09:32.295 --> 00:09:32.920
whatever it is.

00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:35.080
It's going to vary from
one of us to the next.

00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:39.430
But the idea is that, yes, we
pursue these goals as if we

00:09:39.430 --> 00:09:42.765
are sole, independent agents.

00:09:42.765 --> 00:09:46.960
But the extent to which we're
able to achieve our life goals,

00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:49.600
the extent to which we're able
to grow from our actual self

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:52.150
to our ideal self, is
influenced profoundly

00:09:52.150 --> 00:09:54.350
by the nature of our
social relationships.

00:09:54.350 --> 00:09:57.920
And at least in
contemporary America,

00:09:57.920 --> 00:09:59.740
there is no relationship
that affects this

00:09:59.740 --> 00:10:02.930
anywhere near as much, on
average, as the marriage does.

00:10:02.930 --> 00:10:05.110
And so one of the ideas
I play with in the book

00:10:05.110 --> 00:10:08.860
is, all right, so we're
responsible these days

00:10:08.860 --> 00:10:10.990
for sculpting each
other in a way that

00:10:10.990 --> 00:10:13.960
helps to bring out the
best in each other,

00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:16.300
and in particular,
to help us align

00:10:16.300 --> 00:10:18.100
our actual self
with our ideal self,

00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:20.770
with our aspirational,
authentic sense of self.

00:10:20.770 --> 00:10:24.130
And this is a big, extra
ask for the marriage

00:10:24.130 --> 00:10:25.750
that people didn't used to ask.

00:10:25.750 --> 00:10:29.440
But like I said, asking
for those high-level things

00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:30.730
can have some benefits too.

00:10:30.730 --> 00:10:32.521
LOGAN URY: So what's
an example of somebody

00:10:32.521 --> 00:10:36.160
wanting the Michelangelo effect
to happen in their marriage?

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:42.020
ELI FINKEL: OK, so you are
somebody who has always dreamed

00:10:42.020 --> 00:10:45.157
of being an entrepreneur.

00:10:45.157 --> 00:10:46.740
I could have given
a different example

00:10:46.740 --> 00:10:48.489
if I weren't talking
to a Google audience.

00:10:48.489 --> 00:10:49.807
But let's use this example.

00:10:49.807 --> 00:10:51.890
So you've always dreamed
of being an entrepreneur.

00:10:51.890 --> 00:10:53.600
But the fact is, it's scary.

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:54.440
It's scary.

00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:57.620
It's much easier to
have a stable salary

00:10:57.620 --> 00:10:59.540
and not be
responsible for making

00:10:59.540 --> 00:11:02.190
the entire business succeed.

00:11:02.190 --> 00:11:03.590
And so there you are.

00:11:03.590 --> 00:11:05.057
And you've reached
a certain age.

00:11:05.057 --> 00:11:07.140
And maybe the kids are
getting a little bit older.

00:11:07.140 --> 00:11:09.440
And you haven't really
taken this risk yet.

00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:12.320
Now that's the thing about
the actual and the ideal self.

00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:16.790
Those goals that we have that
are part of our ideal self

00:11:16.790 --> 00:11:19.730
but not part of our
actual self are hard.

00:11:19.730 --> 00:11:22.190
If they were easy, we would
have achieved them by now.

00:11:22.190 --> 00:11:25.850
And so our partner,
today, to the degree

00:11:25.850 --> 00:11:28.260
that we have these sorts of
expectations of our marriage

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:30.710
that are much more common
today than in the past,

00:11:30.710 --> 00:11:32.930
our partner has some
sense of responsibility,

00:11:32.930 --> 00:11:36.170
some sense of obligation
to push us to achieve

00:11:36.170 --> 00:11:40.640
these sorts of ambitious,
risky, difficult sorts of goals

00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:42.230
that we haven't
achieved thus far.

00:11:42.230 --> 00:11:44.300
And, oh, by the way,
while our partner

00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:47.340
is pushing us toward this
greater level of excellence,

00:11:47.340 --> 00:11:49.820
this greater level of
personal fulfillment,

00:11:49.820 --> 00:11:52.100
of aspirational
fulfillment, she's

00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:55.580
also responsible for helping
us feel safe, and loved,

00:11:55.580 --> 00:11:57.064
and nurtured and competent.

00:11:57.064 --> 00:11:57.980
So how do you do that?

00:11:57.980 --> 00:12:01.730
How do you make your spouse
feel simultaneously ambitious,

00:12:01.730 --> 00:12:05.420
and hungry, and focused on the
discrepancies between who they

00:12:05.420 --> 00:12:09.250
are and who they
could be, and also

00:12:09.250 --> 00:12:12.230
make us feel loved,
and competent and safe?

00:12:12.230 --> 00:12:14.000
This is a difficult
thing to make somebody

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.060
feel simultaneously
happy with themselves

00:12:17.060 --> 00:12:18.402
and hungry to change.

00:12:18.402 --> 00:12:19.610
LOGAN URY: This sounds risky.

00:12:19.610 --> 00:12:21.320
Because in that
example you gave,

00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:23.630
if the person ends up not
becoming an entrepreneur--

00:12:23.630 --> 00:12:25.430
maybe it just wasn't in them--

00:12:25.430 --> 00:12:27.410
they might blame their
spouse for, oh, you

00:12:27.410 --> 00:12:28.880
didn't encourage me enough.

00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:31.100
Or you put too much
responsibility on me,

00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:32.370
and I couldn't take a risk.

00:12:32.370 --> 00:12:33.671
So what ends up happening?

00:12:33.671 --> 00:12:35.420
ELI FINKEL: I mean, I
do think it's risky.

00:12:35.420 --> 00:12:37.460
I really do.

00:12:37.460 --> 00:12:39.890
Does anybody know
somebody who has

00:12:39.890 --> 00:12:45.470
been in a warm, loving
relationship that's generally

00:12:45.470 --> 00:12:46.700
functioning pretty well?

00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:49.220
Co-CEOs of the
household is going fine

00:12:49.220 --> 00:12:51.620
and respect for each
other is going fine.

00:12:51.620 --> 00:12:54.650
And yet, they think,
I'm not growing.

00:12:54.650 --> 00:12:55.910
I'm stagnant.

00:12:55.910 --> 00:12:59.180
Like, that would have been
a great marriage in 1950--

00:12:59.180 --> 00:13:02.180
or at least it could have been
a very sensible, satisfying

00:13:02.180 --> 00:13:03.140
marriage in 1950.

00:13:03.140 --> 00:13:05.450
But these days,
more and more of us

00:13:05.450 --> 00:13:08.310
feel like that's
not enough anymore.

00:13:08.310 --> 00:13:11.481
And yes, we have to
take some responsibility

00:13:11.481 --> 00:13:13.730
for the extent to which we're
achieving our own goals.

00:13:13.730 --> 00:13:16.200
But there is this implicit
assumption these days

00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:18.980
that, if I'm not growing, one of
the reasons why I'm not growing

00:13:18.980 --> 00:13:21.479
is because the marriage itself
isn't doing with the marriage

00:13:21.479 --> 00:13:23.090
itself is supposed to do.

00:13:23.090 --> 00:13:25.844
And we do end up disappointed
with a marriage that,

00:13:25.844 --> 00:13:27.260
a couple of
generations ago, would

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:28.520
have been fulfilling for us.

00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:31.160
LOGAN URY: So would you say to
that person, just because you

00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:33.350
didn't become a
entrepreneur, don't break up

00:13:33.350 --> 00:13:34.820
your marriage over that.

00:13:34.820 --> 00:13:37.680
Lower your expectations.

00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:43.090
ELI FINKEL: Oh, boy, it's
hard to get prescriptive,

00:13:43.090 --> 00:13:44.490
in a general sense.

00:13:44.490 --> 00:13:47.260
So I actually feel like, if
I had a very concrete case

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:49.190
in front of me,
maybe I would feel--

00:13:49.190 --> 00:13:49.990
LOGAN URY: We'll
see if anyone wants

00:13:49.990 --> 00:13:50.280
to volunteer their marriage.

00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:50.800
Yes Yes.

00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:53.300
Anybody here, like, profoundly
disappointed in your marriage

00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:55.870
and want to share with
the general public?

00:13:58.910 --> 00:14:02.620
No, probably not, on average.

00:14:02.620 --> 00:14:04.624
I would say that
there are many ways

00:14:04.624 --> 00:14:06.540
to build a successful
marriage, and that there

00:14:06.540 --> 00:14:09.264
are no rules that say that we
have to ask our spouse for all

00:14:09.264 --> 00:14:09.930
of these things.

00:14:09.930 --> 00:14:11.910
And we, ourselves,
need to be taking

00:14:11.910 --> 00:14:15.000
a fair bit of responsibility
for places where we're growing,

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.330
or not growing, feeling
stagnant, versus thriving.

00:14:18.330 --> 00:14:21.670
And we have broad
social networks.

00:14:21.670 --> 00:14:23.850
So I mean, Esther
Perel has talked

00:14:23.850 --> 00:14:25.470
about how we look
to our partner to do

00:14:25.470 --> 00:14:26.640
what a village used to do.

00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:27.780
And it's basically true.

00:14:27.780 --> 00:14:31.740
The amount that we expect our
spouse to do for us these days

00:14:31.740 --> 00:14:33.990
is extraordinarily
high by comparison

00:14:33.990 --> 00:14:37.460
to 50 years ago, but
certainly 200 years

00:14:37.460 --> 00:14:40.550
ago. particularly with regard
to our emotional or deeper sort

00:14:40.550 --> 00:14:42.390
of psychological needs.

00:14:42.390 --> 00:14:45.290
And so I feel like, man,
we have a lot of friends.

00:14:45.290 --> 00:14:48.620
We have a lot of other
significant others in our life

00:14:48.620 --> 00:14:49.880
other than our spouse.

00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:52.790
And there probably
are successful ways

00:14:52.790 --> 00:14:54.514
of dealing with
the situation that

00:14:54.514 --> 00:14:56.930
don't call for terminating a
relationship that's otherwise

00:14:56.930 --> 00:14:57.670
fulfilling.

00:14:57.670 --> 00:14:59.461
LOGAN URY: OK, so it
sounds like the answer

00:14:59.461 --> 00:15:01.430
isn't necessarily higher
or lower expectations.

00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:03.276
It's looking for
support elsewhere.

00:15:03.276 --> 00:15:05.150
ELI FINKEL: Yes it's
calibrating expectations

00:15:05.150 --> 00:15:08.150
to what's realistic,
and then building a life

00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:12.320
that is successful or
that has the potential

00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:15.980
to be successful in helping us
meet our broad sense of goals

00:15:15.980 --> 00:15:17.380
and responsibilities.

00:15:17.380 --> 00:15:19.910
And these days, a
lot of us actually

00:15:19.910 --> 00:15:24.200
really do take
pride in our ability

00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:27.260
to build and sustain
a self-expressive sort

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:28.010
of marriage.

00:15:28.010 --> 00:15:30.530
I mean, for a long time,
people were very concerned--

00:15:30.530 --> 00:15:32.000
I think, rightfully so--

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:33.707
that if marriage was
now going to focus

00:15:33.707 --> 00:15:36.290
on personal fulfillment, which
really didn't start until about

00:15:36.290 --> 00:15:38.510
the 1800s, if
marriage-- we're now

00:15:38.510 --> 00:15:40.601
going to focus on
personal fulfillment.

00:15:40.601 --> 00:15:42.850
Why would anybody ever be
committed to their marriage?

00:15:42.850 --> 00:15:45.214
Like, aren't these
incompatible ideals?

00:15:45.214 --> 00:15:46.880
One of the ideas I
play with in the book

00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:50.030
is that personal fulfillment has
a bunch of different flavors.

00:15:50.030 --> 00:15:51.710
And two of the most
significant flavors

00:15:51.710 --> 00:15:54.290
are the distinction
between, like, happiness

00:15:54.290 --> 00:15:57.530
that is a pleasure-based
system versus a meaning

00:15:57.530 --> 00:15:59.120
or purpose-based system.

00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:01.490
And a lot of us who are
trying to achieve fulfillment

00:16:01.490 --> 00:16:06.260
in a meaning-based,
a purpose-based way

00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:07.880
find that an effective
means of doing

00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:10.088
that-- a particularly
effective means of doing that--

00:16:10.088 --> 00:16:12.560
is building, and
developing and maintaining

00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:15.020
a marriage over time,
even when it's hard.

00:16:15.020 --> 00:16:17.120
Building a marriage and
sustaining it even when

00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:19.564
it's hard is one of the ways
that we can grow and one

00:16:19.564 --> 00:16:21.230
of the ways that we
can actually achieve

00:16:21.230 --> 00:16:23.120
this type of fulfillment
that a lot of us

00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:24.190
are pursuing these days.

00:16:24.190 --> 00:16:25.940
LOGAN URY: So you
mentioned recalibrating.

00:16:25.940 --> 00:16:27.374
And one of the
parts of your book

00:16:27.374 --> 00:16:28.790
that I found really
interesting is

00:16:28.790 --> 00:16:31.248
when you talked about, after
the birth of your first child,

00:16:31.248 --> 00:16:33.290
you're experiencing
some postpartum.

00:16:33.290 --> 00:16:35.420
And you actually asked
for different things

00:16:35.420 --> 00:16:36.371
from the marriage.

00:16:36.371 --> 00:16:38.370
Can you talk a little bit
about that experience?

00:16:38.370 --> 00:16:39.410
ELI FINKEL: Yeah, I
mean, I'm happy to talk

00:16:39.410 --> 00:16:41.180
about my personal experience
with this, in large part

00:16:41.180 --> 00:16:43.520
because I'm sure that we're
not the only couple that

00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:44.030
went through this.

00:16:44.030 --> 00:16:46.200
And there's some stigma
associated with this stuff.

00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:49.591
So I went into something
approximating a postpartum

00:16:49.591 --> 00:16:50.090
depression.

00:16:50.090 --> 00:16:52.050
I don't think I technically
had a diagnosis.

00:16:52.050 --> 00:16:54.110
But it was really hard.

00:16:54.110 --> 00:16:58.370
And we have something of
an ideology of parenthood,

00:16:58.370 --> 00:17:01.580
that it's acceptable to
say that you got depressed

00:17:01.580 --> 00:17:04.230
after the kid arrived if
you had a hormonal crash.

00:17:04.230 --> 00:17:07.250
But it's not really considered
acceptable to say that if you

00:17:07.250 --> 00:17:08.510
didn't have a hormonal crash.

00:17:08.510 --> 00:17:11.210
But if you read the evidence,
something like 25% of men

00:17:11.210 --> 00:17:12.859
will go through
at least a period

00:17:12.859 --> 00:17:13.579
where they have this stuff.

00:17:13.579 --> 00:17:14.953
It's of course,
harder for women,

00:17:14.953 --> 00:17:17.220
even if you were to
subtract out the hormones.

00:17:17.220 --> 00:17:19.140
It's, an average, harder
for women these days.

00:17:19.140 --> 00:17:21.516
And so the question is--

00:17:21.516 --> 00:17:22.099
there you are.

00:17:22.099 --> 00:17:23.329
You exist today.

00:17:23.329 --> 00:17:28.040
Most of us have this
perspective on what

00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:31.760
marriage should do for us and
how marriage should function.

00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:34.510
And by and large, in those first
couple of years of marriage,

00:17:34.510 --> 00:17:36.820
many of us are able to
achieve all of that stuff.

00:17:36.820 --> 00:17:38.540
These emotional,
psychological needs

00:17:38.540 --> 00:17:39.890
help with personal growth--

00:17:39.890 --> 00:17:43.220
loving, sexy type relationship.

00:17:43.220 --> 00:17:44.330
And then the kid comes.

00:17:44.330 --> 00:17:48.140
And look, some of us
will just get closer.

00:17:48.140 --> 00:17:49.730
And the sex will get hotter.

00:17:49.730 --> 00:17:52.550
And we'll manage to have just
as much time together as before.

00:17:52.550 --> 00:17:54.900
But those of us
are the exceptions.

00:17:54.900 --> 00:17:58.340
The rule is that you will
have less time together

00:17:58.340 --> 00:18:02.750
with your spouse, less sex than
you did in the past, more puke

00:18:02.750 --> 00:18:04.040
than you did before.

00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:06.320
And in general, it's a
pretty difficult time.

00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:08.360
And that the evidence
on this stuff

00:18:08.360 --> 00:18:13.370
is now very clear, that it is
a perilous time for a marriage,

00:18:13.370 --> 00:18:15.020
the arrival of the first kid.

00:18:15.020 --> 00:18:17.780
None of this is to say that you
don't love your kid like crazy

00:18:17.780 --> 00:18:19.820
and that, when your
kid's four and five,

00:18:19.820 --> 00:18:22.440
you don't miss kissing
that fuzzy little head.

00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:22.940
I do.

00:18:22.940 --> 00:18:23.898
I miss it all the time.

00:18:23.898 --> 00:18:27.350
You know, The newborn phase is
appealing in all sorts of ways.

00:18:27.350 --> 00:18:30.470
The problem is, if you haven't
calibrated your expectations

00:18:30.470 --> 00:18:33.519
about the marriage to be
realistic in light of what

00:18:33.519 --> 00:18:35.810
your life is going to be like
for some number of months

00:18:35.810 --> 00:18:38.450
or maybe years, you're going
to end up disappointed.

00:18:38.450 --> 00:18:39.290
And I did.

00:18:39.290 --> 00:18:39.990
And Allison did.

00:18:39.990 --> 00:18:40.560
My wife did.

00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:42.920
We ended up really
struggling, I mean, really

00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:45.670
struggling for
maybe a year or two.

00:18:45.670 --> 00:18:48.170
And then when she proposed that
we should have a second kid,

00:18:48.170 --> 00:18:51.080
I was like, are
you joking with me?

00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:53.690
But when I say she proposed, I
mean she just informed, really.

00:18:53.690 --> 00:18:56.023
It was more just like, we're
going to have a second one.

00:18:56.023 --> 00:18:56.660
And I said, OK.

00:18:56.660 --> 00:18:59.800
That sounds fine.

00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:01.670
But what we did
effectively-- and I

00:19:01.670 --> 00:19:03.770
don't remember us being
that strategic about it.

00:19:03.770 --> 00:19:06.019
But I think it was the most
important thing we've ever

00:19:06.019 --> 00:19:08.510
done in our marriage--
is we recalibrated

00:19:08.510 --> 00:19:13.250
our expectations to say, it's
going to be a rough stretch.

00:19:13.250 --> 00:19:19.670
And let's stop expecting to
have as much time together,

00:19:19.670 --> 00:19:22.940
as much intimate
experience together,

00:19:22.940 --> 00:19:25.970
really expecting to enjoy
each other as much as usual,

00:19:25.970 --> 00:19:28.420
at least for a little while,
at least till we're sleeping

00:19:28.420 --> 00:19:30.210
through the night, for example.

00:19:30.210 --> 00:19:35.010
And the second time around was,
really, a lot easier for us.

00:19:35.010 --> 00:19:38.409
And I think we were able to
use something-- in the book,

00:19:38.409 --> 00:19:40.200
I talk about some things
called love hacks.

00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:41.380
I don't know if we'll
talk about that here.

00:19:41.380 --> 00:19:43.004
But there's some
quick and dirty things

00:19:43.004 --> 00:19:45.840
you can do in your
marriage, even when

00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:47.970
you don't have time to do
these full-on investments

00:19:47.970 --> 00:19:50.053
that relationships experts
are always telling you,

00:19:50.053 --> 00:19:52.807
you have to do, how you're using
your date nights, and so forth.

00:19:52.807 --> 00:19:54.390
The quick and dirty
things we can do--

00:19:54.390 --> 00:19:55.920
Allison and I did some of those.

00:19:55.920 --> 00:19:57.870
And I think it really
got us to the point

00:19:57.870 --> 00:19:59.730
where we had time
together again.

00:19:59.730 --> 00:20:01.620
And we could really
work on having

00:20:01.620 --> 00:20:04.072
a particularly strong marriage
again some years later.

00:20:04.072 --> 00:20:04.780
LOGAN URY: Great.

00:20:04.780 --> 00:20:06.160
Yeah, we'll come
back to love hacks.

00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:06.390
ELI FINKEL: Sure.

00:20:06.390 --> 00:20:07.890
LOGAN URY: But I'm
B we've gone down

00:20:07.890 --> 00:20:09.270
this tangent about expectations.

00:20:09.270 --> 00:20:12.690
Because a few weeks ago, we
had Mandy Len Catron here.

00:20:12.690 --> 00:20:14.280
And she was here
about her book "How

00:20:14.280 --> 00:20:15.600
to Fall in love With Anyone."

00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:19.060
And the whole book is about
the danger of love stories.

00:20:19.060 --> 00:20:21.420
And in your book, you
talk about how people

00:20:21.420 --> 00:20:23.990
who have really high
expectations of relationships,

00:20:23.990 --> 00:20:24.990
in some ways, it's good.

00:20:24.990 --> 00:20:26.850
They can bring out the
best in their partner.

00:20:26.850 --> 00:20:28.266
But when they hit
trouble, they're

00:20:28.266 --> 00:20:31.470
actually not well-suited
to handle those struggles.

00:20:31.470 --> 00:20:33.550
Perhaps, you could talk
a little bit about that.

00:20:33.550 --> 00:20:35.350
ELI FINKEL: Yeah, I mean
this is, in some sense,

00:20:35.350 --> 00:20:36.308
the thesis of the book.

00:20:36.308 --> 00:20:38.730
The thesis of my
book is basically

00:20:38.730 --> 00:20:42.449
that the changing nature
of our expectations

00:20:42.449 --> 00:20:44.240
has put these great
marriages within reach.

00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:46.198
But it makes it more
difficult to achieve them.

00:20:46.198 --> 00:20:48.120
And so with regard
to this idea that we

00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:50.400
have these scripts,
these stories,

00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:55.270
these expectations about how the
relationship is supposed to go,

00:20:55.270 --> 00:20:58.494
we now have set up a
very specific benchmark.

00:20:58.494 --> 00:21:00.160
And it's pretty clear
when we're falling

00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:01.840
short of that benchmark.

00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:06.610
And actually, some of my
favorite recent research

00:21:06.610 --> 00:21:09.070
in social psychology is
by a researcher named

00:21:09.070 --> 00:21:11.290
Lisa Neff, who is at UT Austin.

00:21:11.290 --> 00:21:14.470
And she's shown that, with
regard to the question,

00:21:14.470 --> 00:21:17.110
is it good or bad to have
high or low expectations

00:21:17.110 --> 00:21:19.300
in your marriage, she has
an interesting perspective

00:21:19.300 --> 00:21:24.590
on this, which is, it's good to
have high global expectations,

00:21:24.590 --> 00:21:27.020
like, my husband is a good guy.

00:21:27.020 --> 00:21:29.930
But it's dangerous to have
high specific expectations,

00:21:29.930 --> 00:21:32.930
like, my husband and I will
have sex at least once a week.

00:21:32.930 --> 00:21:38.030
And the idea is that you can't
really falsify the good guy

00:21:38.030 --> 00:21:39.260
story very easily.

00:21:39.260 --> 00:21:41.300
There's always some way
you can interpret things

00:21:41.300 --> 00:21:42.980
as an exception or whatever.

00:21:42.980 --> 00:21:45.224
But the very concrete
expectations, like,

00:21:45.224 --> 00:21:47.390
I'm looking concretely to
have these sorts of things

00:21:47.390 --> 00:21:48.110
in the marriage.

00:21:48.110 --> 00:21:50.330
And that's what the definition
of a good marriage is.

00:21:50.330 --> 00:21:52.670
When we fall short of those
specific, concrete sorts

00:21:52.670 --> 00:21:55.100
of expectations,
that's the case where

00:21:55.100 --> 00:21:58.304
having those high expectations
is particularly costly.

00:21:58.304 --> 00:21:59.080
LOGAN URY: Great.

00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:01.030
So we've talked a
lot about marriage.

00:22:01.030 --> 00:22:04.390
But there's many happy couples
that live together and are not

00:22:04.390 --> 00:22:05.360
married.

00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:09.100
So you, the relationship
expert, describe

00:22:09.100 --> 00:22:10.750
yourself as pro-marriage.

00:22:10.750 --> 00:22:13.980
What is so special
about marriage?

00:22:13.980 --> 00:22:20.200
ELI FINKEL: Well, marriage--

00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:22.890
so let me say two
things about this.

00:22:22.890 --> 00:22:26.030
I am not of the view that
everybody must marry.

00:22:26.030 --> 00:22:29.210
I mean, I am
pro-marriage, in the sense

00:22:29.210 --> 00:22:33.080
that there are various ways
that we can live our lives.

00:22:33.080 --> 00:22:36.562
And getting married to
somebody we're compatible with

00:22:36.562 --> 00:22:39.020
and then building a long-term
relationship with that person

00:22:39.020 --> 00:22:40.599
looks like it is
a very good one.

00:22:40.599 --> 00:22:42.140
That is, if you look
at the evidence,

00:22:42.140 --> 00:22:43.790
in terms of
relationship well-being,

00:22:43.790 --> 00:22:46.250
but also personal
well-being, this

00:22:46.250 --> 00:22:50.157
is a life choice that
tends to be beneficial.

00:22:50.157 --> 00:22:52.490
Now of course, there's no
guarantee that getting married

00:22:52.490 --> 00:22:54.573
will get you into one of
these good relationships.

00:22:54.573 --> 00:22:56.900
So many people are obviously
happier being single.

00:22:56.900 --> 00:22:59.680
And that's a good
lifestyle choice too.

00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:02.330
"The All-or-Nothing
Marriage" book

00:23:02.330 --> 00:23:09.710
is a blend of an investigation
of marriage as an institution.

00:23:09.710 --> 00:23:12.920
I was really interested in how
our expectations of marriage,

00:23:12.920 --> 00:23:15.980
per se-- not of relationships,
but of marriage, per se--

00:23:15.980 --> 00:23:19.277
have changed, and the
way that has changed

00:23:19.277 --> 00:23:21.110
how we relate in marriage,
and whether we're

00:23:21.110 --> 00:23:22.484
happy in the
marriage versus not.

00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:27.970
I think it's great that we
now have a more flexible

00:23:27.970 --> 00:23:29.020
institution of marriage.

00:23:29.020 --> 00:23:33.205
It used to be a very
exclusive, rigid, strict way

00:23:33.205 --> 00:23:34.330
of thinking about marriage.

00:23:34.330 --> 00:23:37.120
These days, especially with the
Supreme Court decision in 2015,

00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:39.730
for example, that the gay
marriage is now legal--

00:23:39.730 --> 00:23:41.766
so I think there's no
reason why somebody

00:23:41.766 --> 00:23:43.890
who doesn't want to get
married should get married.

00:23:43.890 --> 00:23:46.390
But I will say that,
those of us who

00:23:46.390 --> 00:23:49.870
marry and are happy in
that marriage, the research

00:23:49.870 --> 00:23:52.772
is clear that those
people tend to have very

00:23:52.772 --> 00:23:53.980
fulfilling lives, in general.

00:23:53.980 --> 00:23:57.400
And also, it seems to be, among
other options, a good option

00:23:57.400 --> 00:24:00.627
for raising a family.

00:24:00.627 --> 00:24:02.210
LOGAN URY: So speaking
of the research

00:24:02.210 --> 00:24:04.760
on who tends to get married,
someone without a high school

00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:06.920
degree is much
less likely to have

00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:08.660
a successful marriage
than someone who

00:24:08.660 --> 00:24:10.440
graduated from college.

00:24:10.440 --> 00:24:12.290
So is marriage
becoming an institution

00:24:12.290 --> 00:24:14.930
for the wealthy
and well-educated?

00:24:14.930 --> 00:24:16.850
ELI FINKEL: Well, to
some degree it has.

00:24:16.850 --> 00:24:19.220
But I don't think
that's good news.

00:24:19.220 --> 00:24:21.980
So evidence that I
review in the book

00:24:21.980 --> 00:24:26.900
shows that marriage rates are
significantly down among people

00:24:26.900 --> 00:24:29.330
without a high school
education in America.

00:24:29.330 --> 00:24:32.840
Among those who do marry,
divorce rates are quite high.

00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:35.870
In contrast, among people with
at least a college degree,

00:24:35.870 --> 00:24:38.030
divorce rates have been
plummeting since 1980.

00:24:38.030 --> 00:24:39.620
They're down significantly.

00:24:39.620 --> 00:24:41.240
The institution is
doing pretty well

00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:43.770
among people with
a college degree.

00:24:43.770 --> 00:24:46.460
So it is, in a
sense, an institution

00:24:46.460 --> 00:24:51.306
that's working for people with
more education and more income,

00:24:51.306 --> 00:24:53.180
for example, rather than
for people with less

00:24:53.180 --> 00:24:55.010
education and less income.

00:24:55.010 --> 00:24:58.100
But there's no
evidence that people

00:24:58.100 --> 00:25:00.050
who have less education
and less income

00:25:00.050 --> 00:25:04.100
have really disengaged
from a desire to marry.

00:25:04.100 --> 00:25:06.956
That was a reasonable hypothesis
when you looked at the data.

00:25:06.956 --> 00:25:08.330
It's like, oh,
well, maybe people

00:25:08.330 --> 00:25:09.920
who don't have a
high school degree

00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:11.750
think marriage is
silly or passe.

00:25:11.750 --> 00:25:14.430
If anything, that was supposed
to be the educated among us who

00:25:14.430 --> 00:25:15.471
were supposed to do that.

00:25:15.471 --> 00:25:18.350
But of course, we became
quite traditional, actually,

00:25:18.350 --> 00:25:21.150
in our personal lifestyles.

00:25:21.150 --> 00:25:23.630
So the respect for the
institution of marriage

00:25:23.630 --> 00:25:25.580
is very high among
that group of people

00:25:25.580 --> 00:25:26.940
whose marriage is struggling.

00:25:26.940 --> 00:25:27.980
You can also look
at the evidence.

00:25:27.980 --> 00:25:30.410
Maybe they have different
instincts, different intuitions

00:25:30.410 --> 00:25:33.430
about what makes for a happier
versus a less happy marriage?

00:25:33.430 --> 00:25:34.047
No.

00:25:34.047 --> 00:25:35.630
By and large, there
are no differences

00:25:35.630 --> 00:25:38.330
in what people think is
important in a marriage.

00:25:38.330 --> 00:25:40.400
And I think the story
that we're getting here

00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:45.640
is, it's reasonable
to expect our marriage

00:25:45.640 --> 00:25:49.030
to try to do these high-level
psychological needs to meet

00:25:49.030 --> 00:25:50.620
these expectations that we have.

00:25:50.620 --> 00:25:54.280
But it's hard to do it when
we are under duress, when

00:25:54.280 --> 00:25:58.360
we are under stress,
when our circumstances

00:25:58.360 --> 00:26:02.354
are so challenging that we
don't have time-- even when

00:26:02.354 --> 00:26:04.270
we do get time alone
together, we have to talk

00:26:04.270 --> 00:26:05.470
about heavy, weighty stuff.

00:26:05.470 --> 00:26:07.240
Or we have to fight about
where the money is coming from,

00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:08.080
for example.

00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:11.200
So for me, the analogy to
what Allison and I confronted

00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:14.604
when we endured the
difficult time after when

00:26:14.604 --> 00:26:16.270
I went through my
postpartum depression,

00:26:16.270 --> 00:26:18.850
for example, the difficult time
after having our first kid,

00:26:18.850 --> 00:26:20.470
I think has
interesting analogies

00:26:20.470 --> 00:26:23.140
to what it's like to
try to live in the sort

00:26:23.140 --> 00:26:25.780
of self-expressive
era of marriage

00:26:25.780 --> 00:26:28.660
when you're trying to hold
down two or three jobs, each

00:26:28.660 --> 00:26:31.240
of which requires a commute
on two or three buses.

00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:33.580
It's just there's more
stress in those marriages.

00:26:33.580 --> 00:26:36.160
And it's more difficult,
even with the time

00:26:36.160 --> 00:26:39.995
you get, to let go of the stress
and really savor each other.

00:26:39.995 --> 00:26:42.850
So I think it's
difficult for people

00:26:42.850 --> 00:26:44.470
who have that high
a level of stress

00:26:44.470 --> 00:26:47.560
in their life to succeed
with the current expectations

00:26:47.560 --> 00:26:48.435
that most of us have.

00:26:48.435 --> 00:26:50.476
LOGAN URY: So it sounds
like all groups of people

00:26:50.476 --> 00:26:51.670
tend to want the same thing.

00:26:51.670 --> 00:26:53.657
But it's harder to get
that all marriage when

00:26:53.657 --> 00:26:55.990
you are under a lot of stress
and you have distractions.

00:26:55.990 --> 00:26:56.656
ELI FINKEL: Yes.

00:26:56.656 --> 00:26:58.960
Another reasonable
hypothesis might have been--

00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:00.820
Eli, that's ridiculous.

00:27:00.820 --> 00:27:04.380
You're saying that people
without a high school degree,

00:27:04.380 --> 00:27:07.660
that they also want love
and even self-expression.

00:27:07.660 --> 00:27:08.730
Like, that seems silly.

00:27:08.730 --> 00:27:10.730
But the evidence that
exists is clear with this.

00:27:10.730 --> 00:27:13.130
So for example, if you
ask people, including

00:27:13.130 --> 00:27:15.190
a large sample of
people on welfare,

00:27:15.190 --> 00:27:17.470
nationally-representative
samples of people

00:27:17.470 --> 00:27:21.010
who are poor to well-to-do,
and everything in between,

00:27:21.010 --> 00:27:23.530
and you ask them how important
these various things are

00:27:23.530 --> 00:27:25.780
in your marriage, including,
like, my partner supports

00:27:25.780 --> 00:27:27.880
my hopes and dreams,
there is no difference.

00:27:27.880 --> 00:27:30.490
Up and down the
socioeconomic hierarchy,

00:27:30.490 --> 00:27:32.437
there is no difference
in the extent

00:27:32.437 --> 00:27:33.520
to which people want that.

00:27:33.520 --> 00:27:35.860
And sometimes, when I
get the criticism that

00:27:35.860 --> 00:27:38.140
says that I'm sort
of being insensitive,

00:27:38.140 --> 00:27:39.670
life is really
hard at the bottom

00:27:39.670 --> 00:27:43.150
of the socioeconomic
ladder, I sort of

00:27:43.150 --> 00:27:45.162
feel like those people
are being insulting.

00:27:45.162 --> 00:27:46.870
Like, really, you
don't think poor people

00:27:46.870 --> 00:27:49.078
want a marriage that supports
their hopes and dreams?

00:27:49.078 --> 00:27:49.970
Of course, they do.

00:27:49.970 --> 00:27:52.930
The problem is, it's really
hard to succeed in a marriage

00:27:52.930 --> 00:27:55.420
that you're looking for to
do those sorts of things

00:27:55.420 --> 00:27:57.220
when the stress
level is so high,

00:27:57.220 --> 00:27:59.650
when the exhaustion from dealing
with your day-to-day life

00:27:59.650 --> 00:28:00.100
is so high.

00:28:00.100 --> 00:28:01.600
LOGAN URY: Yeah,
that's fascinating.

00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:03.610
I guess, if we wanted
to support marriage

00:28:03.610 --> 00:28:05.890
in those areas of
the country, it

00:28:05.890 --> 00:28:08.140
would actually be about
things like providing

00:28:08.140 --> 00:28:09.724
affordable childcare.

00:28:09.724 --> 00:28:10.390
ELI FINKEL: Yes.

00:28:10.390 --> 00:28:14.410
I mean, I try in the book not
to get particularly political.

00:28:14.410 --> 00:28:18.190
But I don't think there's
much avoiding the conclusion

00:28:18.190 --> 00:28:24.550
that probably the best
way to help the poor

00:28:24.550 --> 00:28:26.320
have more successful
marriages is

00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:29.110
through liberal-leaning
social policies, more generous

00:28:29.110 --> 00:28:32.860
child care across the board.

00:28:32.860 --> 00:28:37.180
We tend to be relatively
conservative on these--

00:28:37.180 --> 00:28:39.820
compared, certainly, to Western
nations, but even by comparison

00:28:39.820 --> 00:28:42.130
to pretty much
anywhere in the world

00:28:42.130 --> 00:28:43.930
about, for example,
the requirement

00:28:43.930 --> 00:28:45.520
to have paid child care leave.

00:28:45.520 --> 00:28:47.230
So I don't think
that we're going

00:28:47.230 --> 00:28:51.790
to be able to fix marriage
in America among, say,

00:28:51.790 --> 00:28:54.790
the poor and relatively
uneducated by teaching them

00:28:54.790 --> 00:28:56.020
relationship skills.

00:28:56.020 --> 00:28:58.750
I think we can maybe help
around the edges with that.

00:28:58.750 --> 00:29:02.560
But I think, until we
make day-to-day life

00:29:02.560 --> 00:29:05.992
more tenable, more feasible,
more livable for the poor,

00:29:05.992 --> 00:29:07.450
it's going to be
very hard for them

00:29:07.450 --> 00:29:08.710
to have successful marriages.

00:29:08.710 --> 00:29:10.630
Just like it would
be very hard for us

00:29:10.630 --> 00:29:13.089
to have successful marriages
if we were in their situation.

00:29:13.089 --> 00:29:15.546
LOGAN URY: It's interesting
that you mention our child care

00:29:15.546 --> 00:29:16.960
policy versus in
other countries.

00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:19.690
Because in the book, you
talk about, specifically,

00:29:19.690 --> 00:29:21.190
marriage in America.

00:29:21.190 --> 00:29:24.160
And you mentioned that people
here tend to marry and divorce

00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:25.710
at elevated rates.

00:29:25.710 --> 00:29:28.240
What are some other ways
in which American marriages

00:29:28.240 --> 00:29:29.530
are distinct?

00:29:29.530 --> 00:29:32.470
ELI FINKEL: So this marrying
and divorcing at elevated rates

00:29:32.470 --> 00:29:33.160
is interesting.

00:29:33.160 --> 00:29:37.060
Because it results from
certain cultural tendencies

00:29:37.060 --> 00:29:40.150
that we have that people,
even in other Western nations,

00:29:40.150 --> 00:29:41.320
don't tend to have.

00:29:41.320 --> 00:29:42.820
Here, I'm referencing
some research

00:29:42.820 --> 00:29:46.760
by the sociologist Andy
Cherlin at Johns Hopkins.

00:29:46.760 --> 00:29:49.210
So there are lots of
Western nations that

00:29:49.210 --> 00:29:51.610
place a great emphasis
on individuality

00:29:51.610 --> 00:29:53.500
and self-expression,
so for example,

00:29:53.500 --> 00:29:56.350
the Scandinavian countries
or Holland, for example.

00:29:56.350 --> 00:29:58.870
There are also lots of
countries, Western nations,

00:29:58.870 --> 00:30:01.000
that place a lot of
emphasis on the importance

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:04.180
of marital commitment, for
example, Greece, Italy.

00:30:04.180 --> 00:30:06.760
But according to Andy Cherlin--
and I think his evidence here

00:30:06.760 --> 00:30:07.870
is good--

00:30:07.870 --> 00:30:09.850
we're unique among
Western nations.

00:30:09.850 --> 00:30:12.880
That is, we, in America, are
unique among Western nations

00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:15.010
in the extent to
which we prioritize

00:30:15.010 --> 00:30:16.390
both of those things.

00:30:16.390 --> 00:30:18.772
And his 2009 book is called
"The Marriage Go Round."

00:30:18.772 --> 00:30:20.230
And the reason why
it's called that

00:30:20.230 --> 00:30:23.200
is because we have this huge
respect for the institution

00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:23.800
of marriage.

00:30:23.800 --> 00:30:25.010
So we get married.

00:30:25.010 --> 00:30:26.862
But then we have this
really strong emphasis

00:30:26.862 --> 00:30:28.570
that I shouldn't have
to make sacrifices,

00:30:28.570 --> 00:30:32.081
that my self-expression and
personal growth is crucial.

00:30:32.081 --> 00:30:34.580
And I shouldn't have to make
sacrifices in the relationship.

00:30:34.580 --> 00:30:35.290
So we divorce.

00:30:35.290 --> 00:30:36.460
But then we have
this great respect

00:30:36.460 --> 00:30:37.793
for the institution of marriage.

00:30:37.793 --> 00:30:38.530
So we remarry.

00:30:38.530 --> 00:30:41.140
And this process continues.

00:30:41.140 --> 00:30:42.400
And I think he's right.

00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:46.660
Whether we can actually fix
that, whether we can actually

00:30:46.660 --> 00:30:50.980
develop a version of the
sort of self-emphasis,

00:30:50.980 --> 00:30:55.510
the individuality emphasis, that
can obviate the need to divorce

00:30:55.510 --> 00:30:59.300
when things become sort of
restricting and so forth,

00:30:59.300 --> 00:31:00.700
I think we can do that.

00:31:00.700 --> 00:31:03.700
And I think we now are
starting to see pioneers,

00:31:03.700 --> 00:31:06.160
these people who are really
flourishing in the current era,

00:31:06.160 --> 00:31:08.620
who, yes, they do
value self-expression.

00:31:08.620 --> 00:31:11.124
They value the importance
of feeling free and feeling

00:31:11.124 --> 00:31:12.790
like they can grow
through the marriage.

00:31:12.790 --> 00:31:14.670
But they're able to
do it in such a way

00:31:14.670 --> 00:31:17.225
that they still appreciate
marital commitment.

00:31:17.225 --> 00:31:18.850
And then they can
help each other grow.

00:31:18.850 --> 00:31:21.100
And those are the marriages
that, hopefully, we're

00:31:21.100 --> 00:31:22.000
starting to see now.

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:24.880
And hopefully, this will
be the new marital system

00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:27.080
that we have in
the coming decades.

00:31:27.080 --> 00:31:29.590
LOGAN URY: So what's the
impact of a happy marriage

00:31:29.590 --> 00:31:32.110
on our overall
life satisfaction?

00:31:32.110 --> 00:31:33.850
ELI FINKEL: Huge, huge.

00:31:33.850 --> 00:31:38.380
I mean, the evidence that
exists, that correlates,

00:31:38.380 --> 00:31:41.170
how happy are you with
some domain in your life,

00:31:41.170 --> 00:31:44.110
and how happy are you overall
with your quality of life,

00:31:44.110 --> 00:31:45.499
in general?

00:31:45.499 --> 00:31:47.290
The quality of your
marriage-- among people

00:31:47.290 --> 00:31:49.206
who are married-- the
quality of your marriage

00:31:49.206 --> 00:31:52.810
is the single largest predictor
of your overall quality of life

00:31:52.810 --> 00:31:56.020
above, how happy are
you with your health?

00:31:56.020 --> 00:31:58.150
How happy are you with your job?

00:31:58.150 --> 00:32:03.760
So getting this one right
is a really big deal.

00:32:03.760 --> 00:32:06.190
It's probably, again, among
people who are going to marry,

00:32:06.190 --> 00:32:09.151
it is probably the
biggest decision

00:32:09.151 --> 00:32:10.400
that you'll make in your life.

00:32:10.400 --> 00:32:12.790
And once you've made the
decision-- actually, sorry.

00:32:12.790 --> 00:32:13.930
Having kids is a
bigger decision.

00:32:13.930 --> 00:32:15.520
But it is one of the
biggest decisions

00:32:15.520 --> 00:32:16.880
that you will make in your life.

00:32:16.880 --> 00:32:18.820
And then once you've
made the decision,

00:32:18.820 --> 00:32:21.430
working to cultivate
a relationship that's

00:32:21.430 --> 00:32:24.040
really fulfilling for
the two of us is--

00:32:24.040 --> 00:32:28.060
I mean, I don't know that there
are better uses of your time

00:32:28.060 --> 00:32:30.070
and other resources
than trying to cultivate

00:32:30.070 --> 00:32:32.080
a strong relationship
in that way.

00:32:32.080 --> 00:32:33.850
LOGAN URY: So knowing
the large impact

00:32:33.850 --> 00:32:36.706
that marital satisfaction
has on overall happiness,

00:32:36.706 --> 00:32:38.080
I can't be the
only one who feels

00:32:38.080 --> 00:32:39.280
nervous about achieving that.

00:32:39.280 --> 00:32:40.363
ELI FINKEL: Don't mess up.

00:32:40.363 --> 00:32:42.375
Please, whatever you
do, don't mess up.

00:32:42.375 --> 00:32:43.750
LOGAN URY: So for
those of us who

00:32:43.750 --> 00:32:46.210
aren't married, what are the
most important factors we

00:32:46.210 --> 00:32:49.060
should consider when
choosing a partner?

00:32:49.060 --> 00:32:51.010
ELI FINKEL: You know,
this is one that, again,

00:32:51.010 --> 00:32:52.850
it's hard to have
one-size-fits-all answers.

00:32:52.850 --> 00:32:54.760
But one of the
things that I think

00:32:54.760 --> 00:32:57.670
is pretty low-hanging
fruit that very few of us

00:32:57.670 --> 00:33:03.520
do as actively as we could is
to do our best to forecast out

00:33:03.520 --> 00:33:04.360
a little bit.

00:33:04.360 --> 00:33:08.350
So people make decisions
based on how much we're

00:33:08.350 --> 00:33:10.524
in love with each other,
like how much we enjoy

00:33:10.524 --> 00:33:12.190
each other's company,
and how much we're

00:33:12.190 --> 00:33:13.189
in love with each other.

00:33:13.189 --> 00:33:15.312
We take this
snapshot of moments,

00:33:15.312 --> 00:33:17.020
snapshot of two years
when we're in our--

00:33:17.020 --> 00:33:20.184
I don't know-- late 20s,
and then say, this is it.

00:33:20.184 --> 00:33:20.850
This is the one.

00:33:20.850 --> 00:33:22.058
I'm going to do this forever.

00:33:22.058 --> 00:33:24.750
But how representative
of your life together

00:33:24.750 --> 00:33:27.240
is that snapshot of two years?

00:33:27.240 --> 00:33:29.310
Probably very little,
especially for people

00:33:29.310 --> 00:33:31.560
who plan to have kids.

00:33:31.560 --> 00:33:35.700
And so, as much as possible,
we can make an effort

00:33:35.700 --> 00:33:39.870
to forecast out a little
bit, to say, well, where

00:33:39.870 --> 00:33:41.040
do I want to be in 10 years?

00:33:41.040 --> 00:33:42.770
Where do you want
to be in 10 years?

00:33:42.770 --> 00:33:45.060
And really try to
listen to those things.

00:33:45.060 --> 00:33:47.430
And try to be honest with
yourself and with each other

00:33:47.430 --> 00:33:48.221
about those things.

00:33:48.221 --> 00:33:52.860
Because it can happen
that the version of you

00:33:52.860 --> 00:33:55.050
that you love the most,
the version of you

00:33:55.050 --> 00:33:57.740
that you're trying to
achieve, this ideal self,

00:33:57.740 --> 00:34:00.990
that David nested within you
that you're trying to achieve,

00:34:00.990 --> 00:34:03.660
isn't the version of you
that your partner really

00:34:03.660 --> 00:34:04.970
loves most about you.

00:34:04.970 --> 00:34:08.460
We have multiple,
complex selves.

00:34:08.460 --> 00:34:11.880
And getting some sense
of where I hope to be,

00:34:11.880 --> 00:34:14.469
where you hope to
be is a big deal.

00:34:14.469 --> 00:34:16.739
And then in a more
pragmatic level,

00:34:16.739 --> 00:34:21.000
how do we think we want to
navigate things like careers

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:22.650
when the children come?

00:34:22.650 --> 00:34:26.310
It turns out that, except
for the extremely wealthy,

00:34:26.310 --> 00:34:28.380
it's pretty hard for
both people to keep

00:34:28.380 --> 00:34:30.719
going gonzo on the career
front when the kid comes.

00:34:30.719 --> 00:34:32.190
So who is going to
make those sacrifices?

00:34:32.190 --> 00:34:34.030
And how are you going to
navigate those things?

00:34:34.030 --> 00:34:35.988
So I think these are
questions that we can ask.

00:34:35.988 --> 00:34:39.570
The issue is, even if
you ask those questions,

00:34:39.570 --> 00:34:41.969
and even if you think
effectively about the answers

00:34:41.969 --> 00:34:45.060
to those questions, you
still really don't know.

00:34:45.060 --> 00:34:47.429
It's helpful to do,
rather than not do.

00:34:47.429 --> 00:34:51.726
Because your ability to forecast
into the future is not zero.

00:34:51.726 --> 00:34:54.920
But it's hard to know
how you're going to feel.

00:34:54.920 --> 00:34:57.380
Like, I promise
you that I'm going

00:34:57.380 --> 00:35:01.230
to be the one who is the primary
caregiver until the kids are

00:35:01.230 --> 00:35:02.660
in kindergarten.

00:35:02.660 --> 00:35:05.390
You might say that, and mean
it in the most fervent way

00:35:05.390 --> 00:35:09.650
from the bottom of your heart,
and then feel distraught,

00:35:09.650 --> 00:35:11.810
feel this great sense
of loss and isolation

00:35:11.810 --> 00:35:14.450
that you're doing that
task-- or maybe the opposite,

00:35:14.450 --> 00:35:17.000
that I'm willing to commit to
be the primary breadwinner.

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:18.680
But then you just
feel heartache all day

00:35:18.680 --> 00:35:20.263
because you want to
be with your kids.

00:35:20.263 --> 00:35:21.380
So do it.

00:35:21.380 --> 00:35:22.590
Have these discussions.

00:35:22.590 --> 00:35:26.231
But the truth is, marriage is
always going to be a gamble.

00:35:26.231 --> 00:35:28.730
And I think that's, like, the
most beautiful thing about it.

00:35:28.730 --> 00:35:31.770
It's this flying leap that
says, you're going to change.

00:35:31.770 --> 00:35:32.610
I'm going to change.

00:35:32.610 --> 00:35:33.901
We're compatible at the moment.

00:35:33.901 --> 00:35:36.339
And we're just going
to do the best we can.

00:35:36.339 --> 00:35:37.880
so that, even though
you're changing,

00:35:37.880 --> 00:35:39.530
and even though
I'm changing, we're

00:35:39.530 --> 00:35:41.930
going to do everything
possible to make sure

00:35:41.930 --> 00:35:44.409
that we stay compatible over
the next coming decades.

00:35:44.409 --> 00:35:45.700
LOGAN URY: I love that framing.

00:35:45.700 --> 00:35:47.300
Instead of seeing
it as terrifying,

00:35:47.300 --> 00:35:48.150
it's a beautiful flying leap.

00:35:48.150 --> 00:35:48.800
ELI FINKEL: It's beautiful.

00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:49.850
It really is beautiful.

00:35:49.850 --> 00:35:52.580
I mean, think of the things
that we do that are beautiful.

00:35:52.580 --> 00:35:54.950
In your entire life,
you're not going

00:35:54.950 --> 00:36:00.750
to do many things more beautiful
than saying, I love you

00:36:00.750 --> 00:36:02.721
and I want to make
a life with you.

00:36:02.721 --> 00:36:05.220
And let me just say, to hearken
back to your previous point,

00:36:05.220 --> 00:36:07.461
this doesn't have to be
an official marriage.

00:36:07.461 --> 00:36:09.960
And there's many other things
that we do that are beautiful.

00:36:09.960 --> 00:36:12.810
But one of the things that
we do that is very beautiful

00:36:12.810 --> 00:36:15.760
is to say, obviously, we
can't predict the future.

00:36:15.760 --> 00:36:16.642
And yet, here I am.

00:36:16.642 --> 00:36:18.600
LOGAN URY: I guess the
all-or-nothing long-term

00:36:18.600 --> 00:36:20.750
relationship didn't have
the same ring to it.

00:36:20.750 --> 00:36:21.960
ELI FINKEL: No, the
all-or-nothing long-term

00:36:21.960 --> 00:36:23.870
relationship did not
have quite as panache.

00:36:23.870 --> 00:36:24.540
LOGAN URY: Yeah.

00:36:24.540 --> 00:36:26.640
But I love this advice,
because I recently

00:36:26.640 --> 00:36:28.550
interviewed a divorce lawyer.

00:36:28.550 --> 00:36:30.300
And I was asking him,
what are the reasons

00:36:30.300 --> 00:36:32.970
that people get divorced
that I wouldn't necessarily

00:36:32.970 --> 00:36:33.540
know about?

00:36:33.540 --> 00:36:35.400
And he said, people
tend to focus

00:36:35.400 --> 00:36:37.140
on the wedding, this big day.

00:36:37.140 --> 00:36:39.876
And he said, the wedding is
just one day in your marriage.

00:36:39.876 --> 00:36:41.250
And he said, you
wouldn't believe

00:36:41.250 --> 00:36:42.467
how many couples come to me.

00:36:42.467 --> 00:36:44.550
They haven't talked about
where they want to live.

00:36:44.550 --> 00:36:47.220
They haven't talked about
who's going to work or not,

00:36:47.220 --> 00:36:48.540
if they want to have kids.

00:36:48.540 --> 00:36:50.331
So it's kind of exactly
what you're saying.

00:36:50.331 --> 00:36:53.640
ELI FINKEL: I mean, blame
Walt Disney for this.

00:36:53.640 --> 00:36:58.740
I mean, whoever invented the
phrase or the end of sentence,

00:36:58.740 --> 00:37:01.680
and they all lived happily
ever, after was, like, really

00:37:01.680 --> 00:37:03.750
kind of a jerk.

00:37:03.750 --> 00:37:07.350
Because we're led to believe
from mainstream cinema

00:37:07.350 --> 00:37:09.750
and other sorts of
stories that, really, it's

00:37:09.750 --> 00:37:14.790
about the process of, like,
working through complexities

00:37:14.790 --> 00:37:16.620
and finally finding each other.

00:37:16.620 --> 00:37:17.730
And then that's it.

00:37:17.730 --> 00:37:19.590
And then they all live
happily ever after.

00:37:19.590 --> 00:37:21.750
From the perspective of a
relationship researcher,

00:37:21.750 --> 00:37:24.780
that is, like, certifiable.

00:37:24.780 --> 00:37:27.480
The idea that, on
your wedding day--

00:37:27.480 --> 00:37:30.600
or you finally have the
fancy kiss in the rain.

00:37:30.600 --> 00:37:34.650
And it's like, you just
got through the easy part.

00:37:34.650 --> 00:37:36.517
Don't tell me that
that's the hard part

00:37:36.517 --> 00:37:38.100
and now everything's
going to be fine.

00:37:38.100 --> 00:37:40.140
And I think that's the
same idea that the divorce

00:37:40.140 --> 00:37:41.848
lawyer that you're
mentioning talks about

00:37:41.848 --> 00:37:43.810
is, it is going to be hard.

00:37:43.810 --> 00:37:47.080
I don't want to be overly
cynical about this stuff.

00:37:47.080 --> 00:37:48.810
But there's no way
that you're going

00:37:48.810 --> 00:37:51.270
to have 50 years of
unadulterated bliss

00:37:51.270 --> 00:37:52.560
with your spouse.

00:37:52.560 --> 00:37:56.160
And some sort of
sober open-mindedness

00:37:56.160 --> 00:37:58.387
about the ways that
we can navigate

00:37:58.387 --> 00:38:00.720
those sorts of conflicts--
for example, one of the ideas

00:38:00.720 --> 00:38:03.689
that I think is fun is,
we can change how we think

00:38:03.689 --> 00:38:04.980
about conflict in the marriage.

00:38:04.980 --> 00:38:06.690
We can think about
conflict as something

00:38:06.690 --> 00:38:08.100
that reveals incompatibility.

00:38:08.100 --> 00:38:11.190
Or we can think about
conflict as an opportunity

00:38:11.190 --> 00:38:12.930
to grow, and develop and learn.

00:38:12.930 --> 00:38:14.640
And these are the
sorts of things

00:38:14.640 --> 00:38:18.100
that, if you have this
heavily romanticized view,

00:38:18.100 --> 00:38:21.090
you're probably going to
get that one wrong and maybe

00:38:21.090 --> 00:38:23.092
wrong in a profound way.

00:38:23.092 --> 00:38:25.050
LOGAN URY: Now's the
perfect time to transition

00:38:25.050 --> 00:38:27.540
into talking about love
hacks or the techniques

00:38:27.540 --> 00:38:30.220
that couples can use to
improve their relationships.

00:38:30.220 --> 00:38:31.725
Why don't you tell us about
a few of your favorites

00:38:31.725 --> 00:38:32.910
that you mentioned in the book?

00:38:32.910 --> 00:38:34.035
ELI FINKEL: I will do that.

00:38:34.035 --> 00:38:37.960
So the context for this is, we
talked a little bit about how

00:38:37.960 --> 00:38:41.970
the rising expectations
means that particularly great

00:38:41.970 --> 00:38:43.596
marital fulfillment
is within reach.

00:38:43.596 --> 00:38:45.720
But the average marriage
is getting a little worse.

00:38:45.720 --> 00:38:47.790
To some degree, this is
all a big, gussied up

00:38:47.790 --> 00:38:49.350
supply and demand perspective.

00:38:49.350 --> 00:38:52.080
It says, well, what should
you ask of your marriage?

00:38:52.080 --> 00:38:53.961
What should you demand
of your marriage?

00:38:53.961 --> 00:38:56.460
Well, it depends on how much
the marriage is able to supply.

00:38:56.460 --> 00:38:57.870
How compatible are you?

00:38:57.870 --> 00:38:59.580
How much time are you
spending together?

00:38:59.580 --> 00:39:01.140
How are you using
that time together?

00:39:01.140 --> 00:39:02.910
How good are you
at communicating?

00:39:02.910 --> 00:39:04.618
And you need to make
sure that you're not

00:39:04.618 --> 00:39:06.600
asking more than the
marriage can provide,

00:39:06.600 --> 00:39:08.280
or you will end up disappointed.

00:39:08.280 --> 00:39:10.709
And so we can talk about
three general strategies

00:39:10.709 --> 00:39:12.000
for making the marriage better.

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:14.446
One is going all-in strategies,
that relationships people

00:39:14.446 --> 00:39:15.570
will always tell you about.

00:39:15.570 --> 00:39:17.195
I'd be happy to talk
to you about that.

00:39:17.195 --> 00:39:19.380
We talked a little bit
about lowering expectations.

00:39:19.380 --> 00:39:22.780
But what if you're in
this period where you say,

00:39:22.780 --> 00:39:25.230
I'm not ready to give
up on the all marriage?

00:39:25.230 --> 00:39:27.560
I'm not ready to give up
on those expectations,

00:39:27.560 --> 00:39:29.400
these really high-level
psychological

00:39:29.400 --> 00:39:31.710
and emotional expectations
I have for the marriage.

00:39:31.710 --> 00:39:35.726
But holy hell, there are two
screaming toddlers at home.

00:39:35.726 --> 00:39:37.350
And there's a
slow-burning work crisis.

00:39:37.350 --> 00:39:41.400
There's no way that I'm going
to find extra time to have

00:39:41.400 --> 00:39:46.770
to have intimate time
together or a particularly

00:39:46.770 --> 00:39:49.030
thrilling, scintillating
date night once a week.

00:39:49.030 --> 00:39:50.370
It's just not the time for that.

00:39:50.370 --> 00:39:54.450
So this is where I think love
hacks, this set of procedures

00:39:54.450 --> 00:39:58.309
I've introduced in the book, I
think are particularly helpful.

00:39:58.309 --> 00:39:59.100
I talk about eight.

00:39:59.100 --> 00:40:00.474
All of them are
based in science.

00:40:00.474 --> 00:40:03.570
So these are all
research-supported procedures

00:40:03.570 --> 00:40:07.470
that social scientists have
developed in the last 10, 15

00:40:07.470 --> 00:40:09.070
years or so that we can use.

00:40:09.070 --> 00:40:10.070
So one of my favorites--

00:40:10.070 --> 00:40:11.340
I am biased.

00:40:11.340 --> 00:40:12.990
We developed this
one in our lab.

00:40:12.990 --> 00:40:16.950
But it involves how we
think about conflict.

00:40:16.950 --> 00:40:18.270
So I'll tell you about that.

00:40:18.270 --> 00:40:20.130
The two defining
features of a love hack--

00:40:20.130 --> 00:40:21.550
I forgot to mention
this earlier.

00:40:21.550 --> 00:40:23.426
Number one, these are
quick and dirty things.

00:40:23.426 --> 00:40:24.466
So maybe-- I don't know--

00:40:24.466 --> 00:40:25.290
10 minutes a month.

00:40:25.290 --> 00:40:27.880
Number two, you don't even have
to do them with your partner.

00:40:27.880 --> 00:40:30.180
So these are things
that you can do that--

00:40:30.180 --> 00:40:32.070
according to Marcel
Proust, mystery

00:40:32.070 --> 00:40:33.960
is not about traveling
to new places,

00:40:33.960 --> 00:40:36.060
but about looking with new eyes.

00:40:36.060 --> 00:40:38.940
So love hacks are things we can
do to try to look with new eyes

00:40:38.940 --> 00:40:41.970
at the relationship, look
with the generous new eyes.

00:40:41.970 --> 00:40:44.460
So this procedure from
our lab, what happens

00:40:44.460 --> 00:40:47.820
is this is a way that we can
think more constructively

00:40:47.820 --> 00:40:50.017
about conflict in the marriage.

00:40:50.017 --> 00:40:51.600
And so what we did
in this study is we

00:40:51.600 --> 00:40:53.820
brought in 120 married couples.

00:40:53.820 --> 00:40:55.770
And every four
months for two years,

00:40:55.770 --> 00:40:57.330
they wrote about
the biggest conflict

00:40:57.330 --> 00:40:59.790
they had in their marriage.

00:40:59.790 --> 00:41:02.520
In the second year, we randomly
assigned half of those people--

00:41:02.520 --> 00:41:04.480
yes, also to write
about the conflict,

00:41:04.480 --> 00:41:07.140
but to do seven additional
minutes of writing, trying

00:41:07.140 --> 00:41:09.480
to think about the conflict
from the perspective

00:41:09.480 --> 00:41:11.550
of a neutral third
party who wants

00:41:11.550 --> 00:41:12.910
the best for all involved.

00:41:12.910 --> 00:41:14.400
So again, you've got
the control condition.

00:41:14.400 --> 00:41:15.899
Then you've got
this extra condition

00:41:15.899 --> 00:41:17.970
where, for seven
minutes, you're trying

00:41:17.970 --> 00:41:20.490
to think about the conflict,
not from your own perspective,

00:41:20.490 --> 00:41:22.860
but from the perspective of a
neutral third party who wants

00:41:22.860 --> 00:41:23.943
the best for all involved.

00:41:23.943 --> 00:41:25.710
And we find that
doing that procedure

00:41:25.710 --> 00:41:28.770
does, indeed, increase
marital satisfaction, even

00:41:28.770 --> 00:41:30.711
marital passion,
which surprised us.

00:41:30.711 --> 00:41:32.460
And there are a number
of other techniques

00:41:32.460 --> 00:41:35.640
I talk about in the book,
particularly the extent

00:41:35.640 --> 00:41:39.240
to which we have some
control over how we

00:41:39.240 --> 00:41:40.940
explain our partner's behavior.

00:41:40.940 --> 00:41:42.600
Like, we think we're
affected directly

00:41:42.600 --> 00:41:44.080
by our partner's behavior.

00:41:44.080 --> 00:41:45.960
But by and large, that's false.

00:41:45.960 --> 00:41:47.667
We're affected by
our perceptions

00:41:47.667 --> 00:41:48.750
of our partner's behavior.

00:41:48.750 --> 00:41:51.510
And so we have a
good deal of control

00:41:51.510 --> 00:41:54.540
if we want to exert it about
how we feel about it when

00:41:54.540 --> 00:41:56.010
our partner doesn't
call us back,

00:41:56.010 --> 00:41:58.500
how we feel about it when our
partner gives us a surprise

00:41:58.500 --> 00:41:59.070
gift.

00:41:59.070 --> 00:42:00.750
And the book talks
a lot about how

00:42:00.750 --> 00:42:04.530
we can leverage these
insights about the way we

00:42:04.530 --> 00:42:07.005
think about the marriage
to strengthen the marriage.

00:42:07.005 --> 00:42:08.380
LOGAN URY: So to
summarize, there

00:42:08.380 --> 00:42:10.509
is the going all-in
strategies, which

00:42:10.509 --> 00:42:12.675
are what probably many of
us have heard about, like,

00:42:12.675 --> 00:42:13.716
spend more time together.

00:42:13.716 --> 00:42:14.460
Have more sex.

00:42:14.460 --> 00:42:15.527
Go on date nights.

00:42:15.527 --> 00:42:17.610
There's the love hacks,
which are quick and dirty.

00:42:17.610 --> 00:42:20.370
And then, I think,
this was the first book

00:42:20.370 --> 00:42:23.490
that I really read that talked
about these recalibrations.

00:42:23.490 --> 00:42:25.919
And one of them
was that couples--

00:42:25.919 --> 00:42:27.960
and you mentioned, this
is very high-risk-- might

00:42:27.960 --> 00:42:30.570
want to consider opening
up their marriages.

00:42:30.570 --> 00:42:32.220
So can you tell us
a bit about what

00:42:32.220 --> 00:42:36.270
the research says about how
consensual, non-monogamous

00:42:36.270 --> 00:42:37.752
relationships work?

00:42:37.752 --> 00:42:38.460
ELI FINKEL: Sure.

00:42:38.460 --> 00:42:40.290
Millennials, stay tuned in.

00:42:40.290 --> 00:42:42.990
Gen Xers, it's a
little dicey here.

00:42:42.990 --> 00:42:46.740
And other generations,
please tune out.

00:42:46.740 --> 00:42:49.020
Look, I spend a whole
chapter in the book that

00:42:49.020 --> 00:42:51.750
talks about a variety
of ways that we

00:42:51.750 --> 00:42:54.980
can ask less of the marriage.

00:42:54.980 --> 00:42:56.400
There's a whole chapter on this.

00:42:56.400 --> 00:42:57.691
There's chapters on love hacks.

00:42:57.691 --> 00:43:00.450
There's a chapter on how we
can go all-in, the best way

00:43:00.450 --> 00:43:01.620
to use our date night time.

00:43:01.620 --> 00:43:03.540
Like, just saying, go on date
nights is not sufficient,

00:43:03.540 --> 00:43:05.640
but research now tells
us, what are good ways

00:43:05.640 --> 00:43:07.530
to use that time together?

00:43:07.530 --> 00:43:09.690
And I have a chapter
saying, look,

00:43:09.690 --> 00:43:13.770
there are probably ways that
your marriage is reliably

00:43:13.770 --> 00:43:15.030
falling short of expectations.

00:43:15.030 --> 00:43:16.270
And it's making you frustrated.

00:43:16.270 --> 00:43:17.160
And it's making you angry.

00:43:17.160 --> 00:43:18.600
And it's making
you disappointed.

00:43:18.600 --> 00:43:21.660
Can you identify
what those areas are?

00:43:21.660 --> 00:43:24.439
And if you can't fix them
through going all-in,

00:43:24.439 --> 00:43:25.980
there's no reason
why you have to ask

00:43:25.980 --> 00:43:27.105
that stuff of the marriage.

00:43:27.105 --> 00:43:28.880
There might be ways
that you can reduce

00:43:28.880 --> 00:43:30.630
the amount of
disappointment that you feel

00:43:30.630 --> 00:43:32.070
by asking less of the marriage.

00:43:32.070 --> 00:43:34.361
And again, there's a number
of procedures I talk about.

00:43:34.361 --> 00:43:36.660
But yes, one of the
ones that I talk about

00:43:36.660 --> 00:43:38.790
is consensual non-monogamy.

00:43:38.790 --> 00:43:40.280
Now again, this is not cheating.

00:43:40.280 --> 00:43:42.210
This is consensual non-monogamy.

00:43:42.210 --> 00:43:44.086
There's a bunch of
variations on these ideas.

00:43:44.086 --> 00:43:45.543
I think there's a
lot of people who

00:43:45.543 --> 00:43:46.920
can enjoy consensual
non-monogamy

00:43:46.920 --> 00:43:48.760
for a lot of reasons.

00:43:48.760 --> 00:43:51.720
But one of the reasons
why somebody who might not

00:43:51.720 --> 00:43:55.290
be positively disposed
toward the idea at first

00:43:55.290 --> 00:43:57.000
might want to
consider it is when

00:43:57.000 --> 00:43:59.010
you think of how
many relationships

00:43:59.010 --> 00:44:01.800
are fulfilling in most ways--

00:44:01.800 --> 00:44:03.360
again, we're good CEOs together.

00:44:03.360 --> 00:44:04.420
We even love each other.

00:44:04.420 --> 00:44:08.350
We recognize that the other
person is a good parent.

00:44:08.350 --> 00:44:11.010
But we haven't had sex
in, like, 18 months.

00:44:11.010 --> 00:44:14.159
Or one of us always wants to
and the other one never does.

00:44:14.159 --> 00:44:15.450
And so one person feels guilty.

00:44:15.450 --> 00:44:17.040
And one person feels rejected.

00:44:17.040 --> 00:44:18.750
This is not rare.

00:44:18.750 --> 00:44:20.740
These are not rare situations.

00:44:20.740 --> 00:44:23.130
So I'm not saying that
the only sensible solution

00:44:23.130 --> 00:44:26.640
for those people is to explore
the possibility of opening up

00:44:26.640 --> 00:44:29.070
the marriage, making
it non-monogamous

00:44:29.070 --> 00:44:31.090
in some consensual way.

00:44:31.090 --> 00:44:34.200
But one of the things that
probably should be on the table

00:44:34.200 --> 00:44:36.060
is at least a
conversation about that.

00:44:36.060 --> 00:44:39.480
And I don't think it's
serving us well as a society

00:44:39.480 --> 00:44:41.280
that all of us are
terrified to broach

00:44:41.280 --> 00:44:43.350
that subject with our spouse.

00:44:43.350 --> 00:44:46.470
So yes, there are many ways
of trying to fix that problem,

00:44:46.470 --> 00:44:48.300
going all-in, love hacking.

00:44:48.300 --> 00:44:51.810
But one of them can be
considering non-monogamy.

00:44:51.810 --> 00:44:53.040
It is high-risk.

00:44:53.040 --> 00:44:55.390
It is especially
high-risk, because we

00:44:55.390 --> 00:44:57.390
might think we're going
to be OK with our spouse

00:44:57.390 --> 00:44:58.590
having a certain
sort of relationship

00:44:58.590 --> 00:44:59.460
with another person.

00:44:59.460 --> 00:45:02.370
And then it happens, and we
just feel absolutely eviscerated

00:45:02.370 --> 00:45:03.600
by the experience.

00:45:03.600 --> 00:45:05.610
And that is the sort of
risk that we're taking.

00:45:05.610 --> 00:45:07.532
And it is not to be dismissed.

00:45:07.532 --> 00:45:09.240
But just because
there's some risk in it,

00:45:09.240 --> 00:45:11.430
doesn't mean we should be
dismissing it out of hand.

00:45:11.430 --> 00:45:12.390
Because you know what?

00:45:12.390 --> 00:45:16.242
It's not like this monogamous
thing is working for everybody.

00:45:16.242 --> 00:45:16.950
LOGAN URY: Great.

00:45:16.950 --> 00:45:19.170
So I'm going to ask one
more final question.

00:45:19.170 --> 00:45:21.790
And then we'll open it up to
questions from the audience.

00:45:21.790 --> 00:45:24.030
This is something that I
ask everyone I interview.

00:45:24.030 --> 00:45:25.710
So here it is.

00:45:25.710 --> 00:45:28.260
At Google, we have the
google.com homepage,

00:45:28.260 --> 00:45:30.480
that white screen with
the logo where people

00:45:30.480 --> 00:45:32.430
search billions of times a day.

00:45:32.430 --> 00:45:35.220
If you could put a line
of text under the logo,

00:45:35.220 --> 00:45:36.510
what would you say?

00:45:36.510 --> 00:45:38.720
And since this is a
modern romance talk,

00:45:38.720 --> 00:45:40.260
I'll ask, what's
the one line you

00:45:40.260 --> 00:45:41.970
would add to
immediately help people

00:45:41.970 --> 00:45:43.954
in their sex and relationships?

00:45:47.342 --> 00:45:49.050
ELI FINKEL: That was
two things, I think.

00:45:49.050 --> 00:45:54.860
OK, so Ellen Berscheid,
she basically

00:45:54.860 --> 00:45:57.954
founded a field that
has now called--

00:45:57.954 --> 00:45:59.870
maybe tacky-- we call
it relationship science.

00:45:59.870 --> 00:46:02.660
It's developing
hypotheses and using data

00:46:02.660 --> 00:46:05.330
to test ideas about
what works and what

00:46:05.330 --> 00:46:07.010
doesn't work in relationships.

00:46:07.010 --> 00:46:10.520
She has a line
that I really love.

00:46:10.520 --> 00:46:14.300
And it's something like,
relationships with other humans

00:46:14.300 --> 00:46:18.670
are the foundation and the
theme of the human condition.

00:46:18.670 --> 00:46:22.310
And so I would put that
underneath the Google bar.

00:46:22.310 --> 00:46:26.502
And then I would say, how
are you spending your day?

00:46:26.502 --> 00:46:27.710
What was the second question?

00:46:27.710 --> 00:46:28.490
LOGAN URY: No, you got it.

00:46:28.490 --> 00:46:28.820
ELI FINKEL: Oh, I got both!

00:46:28.820 --> 00:46:29.340
LOGAN URY: You nailed it!

00:46:29.340 --> 00:46:30.110
ELI FINKEL: Phew, OK.

00:46:30.110 --> 00:46:31.193
LOGAN URY: That's perfect.

00:46:31.193 --> 00:46:33.350
Whoever here works on
the doodle, get on that.

00:46:33.350 --> 00:46:34.760
ELI FINKEL: Yeah, I'm sure
everyone will love that.

00:46:34.760 --> 00:46:35.690
LOGAN URY: Great.

00:46:35.690 --> 00:46:39.560
So we have Scott and Julia, who
are going to stand up and pass

00:46:39.560 --> 00:46:40.280
around the mic.

00:46:40.280 --> 00:46:43.137
If you don't mind just standing
up and saying your name,

00:46:43.137 --> 00:46:43.970
that would be great.

00:46:43.970 --> 00:46:45.922
So raise your hand if
you have a question.

00:46:50.997 --> 00:46:52.080
ELI FINKEL: Just throw it.

00:47:00.917 --> 00:47:02.250
AUDIENCE: Hi, thanks for coming.

00:47:02.250 --> 00:47:03.550
I'm [INAUDIBLE].

00:47:03.550 --> 00:47:05.580
In the controlled experiments
that you mentioned

00:47:05.580 --> 00:47:08.070
for developing
your love hack, you

00:47:08.070 --> 00:47:11.460
said that you asked people to
think about how a third party,

00:47:11.460 --> 00:47:14.160
objective person would
interpret the situation.

00:47:14.160 --> 00:47:17.580
Why didn't you ask them to
think how their partner would

00:47:17.580 --> 00:47:18.930
interpret the situation?

00:47:18.930 --> 00:47:19.763
ELI FINKEL: Oh, boy.

00:47:19.763 --> 00:47:22.100
That might have
worked too, right?

00:47:22.100 --> 00:47:26.810
We based it on research in
social psychology and my home

00:47:26.810 --> 00:47:29.510
discipline on the importance
of self-distancing,

00:47:29.510 --> 00:47:33.320
on getting away from the
heat of the here and now.

00:47:33.320 --> 00:47:36.800
And so the instinct
we had was, what's

00:47:36.800 --> 00:47:39.050
an effective means
of getting people

00:47:39.050 --> 00:47:40.730
to step outside themselves?

00:47:40.730 --> 00:47:43.910
We know that your default
perspective is the one that

00:47:43.910 --> 00:47:45.470
comes through your eyes.

00:47:45.470 --> 00:47:47.540
And so from your
perspective, it's

00:47:47.540 --> 00:47:50.270
easy to focus on what's the
outrages that your partner has

00:47:50.270 --> 00:47:50.771
perpetrated.

00:47:50.771 --> 00:47:52.145
And we thought,
if you're looking

00:47:52.145 --> 00:47:53.600
from an external
perspective, you

00:47:53.600 --> 00:47:59.300
may well see things in a more
generous, all-encompassing way.

00:47:59.300 --> 00:48:01.850
But your idea of a study, I
think, is fascinating too.

00:48:01.850 --> 00:48:03.862
We easily could do a
study-- not easily.

00:48:03.862 --> 00:48:05.070
These are hard studies to do.

00:48:05.070 --> 00:48:08.227
But we could do a study
where we did our manipulation

00:48:08.227 --> 00:48:10.310
and then had another
condition where we said, take

00:48:10.310 --> 00:48:11.780
your partner's perspective.

00:48:11.780 --> 00:48:12.635
And I have no idea--

00:48:12.635 --> 00:48:14.510
it's funny, when you
start thinking, like, I,

00:48:14.510 --> 00:48:15.654
myself am a jerk.

00:48:15.654 --> 00:48:16.820
How have I been such a jerk?

00:48:16.820 --> 00:48:18.986
Because you'd see things
from the other perspective.

00:48:18.986 --> 00:48:19.653
I love the idea.

00:48:19.653 --> 00:48:21.360
AUDIENCE: Yeah, the
reason I'm mentioning

00:48:21.360 --> 00:48:22.895
is I'm always
accusing my husband

00:48:22.895 --> 00:48:24.740
of not being empathetic enough.

00:48:24.740 --> 00:48:27.890
And I always ask him, why don't
you put yourself in my shoes?

00:48:27.890 --> 00:48:29.820
But that doesn't work either.

00:48:29.820 --> 00:48:32.800
So I think the good idea is
to bring in a third objective

00:48:32.800 --> 00:48:33.300
person.

00:48:33.300 --> 00:48:34.160
ELI FINKEL: Maybe
the third party.

00:48:34.160 --> 00:48:36.710
So when you're accusing him
of not being sufficiently

00:48:36.710 --> 00:48:38.360
empathetic with
your needs, do you

00:48:38.360 --> 00:48:40.580
think you're being sufficiently
empathetic with his?

00:48:40.580 --> 00:48:41.270
AUDIENCE: Maybe not.

00:48:41.270 --> 00:48:42.760
I think I need to bring
in another person.

00:48:42.760 --> 00:48:43.220
ELI FINKEL: Right.

00:48:43.220 --> 00:48:45.230
From our own perspective, it's
easy to be like, why aren't you

00:48:45.230 --> 00:48:46.460
understanding me?

00:48:46.460 --> 00:48:49.520
And it's hard to get us out
of that space, especially

00:48:49.520 --> 00:48:51.080
when things are feeling tense.

00:48:54.920 --> 00:48:57.342
AUDIENCE: Hi, can you hear me?

00:48:57.342 --> 00:48:58.050
ELI FINKEL: Yeah.

00:48:58.050 --> 00:49:00.200
AUDIENCE: I go by
[INAUDIBLE] at Google.

00:49:03.970 --> 00:49:05.830
You mentioned that being
educated and having

00:49:05.830 --> 00:49:09.000
higher education reduced the
chance of failed marriage.

00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:11.660
But I read a research that
professors under tenure track

00:49:11.660 --> 00:49:14.620
has one of the highest
rates of getting divorced.

00:49:14.620 --> 00:49:16.900
And so isn't it the
case that the level

00:49:16.900 --> 00:49:20.870
of your job and the time that
you can have with your spouse

00:49:20.870 --> 00:49:23.940
is more of a big factor
into a failed marriage

00:49:23.940 --> 00:49:25.120
than the education level?

00:49:25.120 --> 00:49:26.520
I mean, that's just one--

00:49:26.520 --> 00:49:28.550
ELI FINKEL: No, I mean,
that's a great question.

00:49:28.550 --> 00:49:29.670
I don't know the data.

00:49:29.670 --> 00:49:31.050
So the data you're
citing suggest

00:49:31.050 --> 00:49:32.508
that professors on
the tenure track

00:49:32.508 --> 00:49:36.160
are at risk for divorce, which
I mainly just find hilarious.

00:49:36.160 --> 00:49:38.350
But the broader
point you're making

00:49:38.350 --> 00:49:41.450
is one that's really
important to me.

00:49:41.450 --> 00:49:45.259
So I wrote a 2014 op
ed piece in "The Times"

00:49:45.259 --> 00:49:47.300
that was also called The
All-or-Nothing Marriage.

00:49:47.300 --> 00:49:49.750
It was sort of the foundation
of what became the book.

00:49:49.750 --> 00:49:53.620
And Slate published a piece
that seemed really unfair to me.

00:49:53.620 --> 00:49:56.140
They published a piece that
the title was something

00:49:56.140 --> 00:49:59.800
like, The NYT
Congratulates Rich People

00:49:59.800 --> 00:50:01.660
For Having Good Marriages.

00:50:01.660 --> 00:50:03.800
And the piece was written.

00:50:03.800 --> 00:50:06.370
And it said something
like, what makes

00:50:06.370 --> 00:50:09.550
for a marriage good or bad
is not finding time together

00:50:09.550 --> 00:50:11.650
or investing in the marriage.

00:50:11.650 --> 00:50:14.180
It's about the radical
inequality in our nation.

00:50:14.180 --> 00:50:16.960
But the author is right.

00:50:16.960 --> 00:50:18.940
And I never said anything
different from that.

00:50:18.940 --> 00:50:20.650
You heard me say,
basically, that today.

00:50:20.650 --> 00:50:22.240
AUDIENCE: I think you said
two things, which is, like,

00:50:22.240 --> 00:50:24.420
education level and
financial stability,

00:50:24.420 --> 00:50:26.080
those are the two
co-founding factors.

00:50:26.080 --> 00:50:28.240
But then I totally
believe with you

00:50:28.240 --> 00:50:32.160
the financial is like one of
the really contributing factor.

00:50:32.160 --> 00:50:34.160
But I'm not so sure
about the education

00:50:34.160 --> 00:50:36.520
level it was is my point.

00:50:36.520 --> 00:50:38.350
ELI FINKEL: Well I
mean, I think we agree.

00:50:38.350 --> 00:50:40.750
So what I think anybody who
wants to make that argument--

00:50:40.750 --> 00:50:41.650
so if somebody wants to take--

00:50:41.650 --> 00:50:42.525
I don't think you do.

00:50:42.525 --> 00:50:45.850
But anybody who wants to
take me to the mat and say,

00:50:45.850 --> 00:50:48.280
well, it's all
socioeconomic status.

00:50:48.280 --> 00:50:49.240
It's all social class.

00:50:49.240 --> 00:50:50.698
Because I'm certainly
acknowledging

00:50:50.698 --> 00:50:52.870
how important social class is--

00:50:52.870 --> 00:50:55.540
needs a compelling explanation
for why millions of rich people

00:50:55.540 --> 00:50:57.820
have bad marriages and
millions of poor people

00:50:57.820 --> 00:50:58.780
have good marriages.

00:50:58.780 --> 00:51:02.890
So I share what I understand
to be your instinct,

00:51:02.890 --> 00:51:06.031
is that education
is not destiny,

00:51:06.031 --> 00:51:07.780
and that one of the
major reasons why it's

00:51:07.780 --> 00:51:11.320
so difficult to achieve a
successful marriage today

00:51:11.320 --> 00:51:15.844
in the current socioeconomic
climate for people who are poor

00:51:15.844 --> 00:51:18.010
is that there's an immense
amount of stress on them.

00:51:18.010 --> 00:51:20.010
And yes, you can get an
immense amount of stress

00:51:20.010 --> 00:51:22.130
on you even if
you're well-educated.

00:51:22.130 --> 00:51:24.820
You're an investment banker
working 100 hours a week

00:51:24.820 --> 00:51:27.635
trying to close a deal.

00:51:27.635 --> 00:51:30.010
So these sorts of things are
other sources of big stress.

00:51:30.010 --> 00:51:32.010
And do I think that, even
among educated people,

00:51:32.010 --> 00:51:33.760
those sources of stress
are likely to put

00:51:33.760 --> 00:51:34.850
our marriages at risk?

00:51:34.850 --> 00:51:37.859
Yeah, for sure I do.

00:51:37.859 --> 00:51:38.400
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:51:38.400 --> 00:51:42.320
[INAUDIBLE]

00:51:42.320 --> 00:51:43.470
AUDIENCE: Oh, hi.

00:51:43.470 --> 00:51:45.030
My name is Ibrahim.

00:51:45.030 --> 00:51:46.620
I'm a new grad engineer.

00:51:46.620 --> 00:51:48.870
I recently graduated
from school.

00:51:48.870 --> 00:51:52.650
So my question is more about
online dating and specifically

00:51:52.650 --> 00:51:59.840
these casual dating apps
that people use to meet up.

00:51:59.840 --> 00:52:02.120
So in the next few
years, we're going

00:52:02.120 --> 00:52:07.376
to have married people who
basically met on these apps.

00:52:07.376 --> 00:52:08.750
ELI FINKEL: We
have them already.

00:52:08.750 --> 00:52:10.460
AUDIENCE: Yeah, yeah,
just getting more.

00:52:10.460 --> 00:52:12.920
So my question is
about, how do you

00:52:12.920 --> 00:52:16.660
think that's going to affect
the institution of marriage?

00:52:16.660 --> 00:52:18.530
ELI FINKEL: Not
much is my guess.

00:52:18.530 --> 00:52:21.899
So the question's about
how marriage is changing

00:52:21.899 --> 00:52:23.190
because people met differently.

00:52:23.190 --> 00:52:25.800
So online dating-- which is a
term I'm not sure people even

00:52:25.800 --> 00:52:26.310
use anymore.

00:52:26.310 --> 00:52:28.050
But it was always a misnomer.

00:52:28.050 --> 00:52:29.960
Because it's not that
people date online.

00:52:29.960 --> 00:52:31.230
They met online.

00:52:31.230 --> 00:52:35.140
And now they're meeting through
Tinder, or Bumble or whatever.

00:52:35.140 --> 00:52:39.260
And eventually, they
get face-to-face.

00:52:39.260 --> 00:52:40.930
And they face the
same sorts of issues

00:52:40.930 --> 00:52:44.020
that people who meet through
church or through the baseball

00:52:44.020 --> 00:52:45.970
game face.

00:52:45.970 --> 00:52:46.930
Do we have rapport?

00:52:46.930 --> 00:52:48.930
Is there sexual compatibility,
the sort of stuff

00:52:48.930 --> 00:52:50.240
we were talking about earlier.

00:52:50.240 --> 00:52:52.370
One of the interesting
questions is,

00:52:52.370 --> 00:52:55.930
what are the consequences of
having this massive singles

00:52:55.930 --> 00:52:58.150
bar in your pocket
or in your purse?

00:52:58.150 --> 00:53:00.160
What are the
consequences of knowing

00:53:00.160 --> 00:53:03.017
that there is a
functionally infinite range

00:53:03.017 --> 00:53:05.350
of possible people out there
that you could go on a date

00:53:05.350 --> 00:53:07.150
with as soon as tonight?

00:53:07.150 --> 00:53:11.290
And here, I think I'm one of
the most optimistic people.

00:53:11.290 --> 00:53:13.180
And the reason why
I'm less concerned

00:53:13.180 --> 00:53:15.222
that having a singles bar
in your pocket is going

00:53:15.222 --> 00:53:16.638
is going to break
up your marriage

00:53:16.638 --> 00:53:18.700
or any long-term relationship
is because people

00:53:18.700 --> 00:53:21.472
who are happy in their
relationship aren't looking.

00:53:21.472 --> 00:53:23.680
So it doesn't matter that
there's a huge singles bar.

00:53:23.680 --> 00:53:27.490
I think the consequences
of having a big singles

00:53:27.490 --> 00:53:29.890
bar in your pocket
or in your purse

00:53:29.890 --> 00:53:32.650
are potentially
serious among people

00:53:32.650 --> 00:53:36.340
who are becoming dissatisfied
anyway, or at least starting

00:53:36.340 --> 00:53:38.560
to feel like, huh, I wonder
what else is out there?

00:53:38.560 --> 00:53:42.180
It lowers the friction
between the thought that says,

00:53:42.180 --> 00:53:44.804
huh, I wonder what's
out there, and now I'm

00:53:44.804 --> 00:53:45.970
actually pursuing something.

00:53:45.970 --> 00:53:48.400
Because going out
to a singles bar

00:53:48.400 --> 00:53:50.105
and starting to
flirt with someone,

00:53:50.105 --> 00:53:52.480
buying someone a drink, or
batting eyelashes, or whatever

00:53:52.480 --> 00:53:54.880
people do in singles'
bars, that is

00:53:54.880 --> 00:53:58.090
a pretty high bar for
saying, my marriage

00:53:58.090 --> 00:53:59.620
is really on the rocks.

00:53:59.620 --> 00:54:03.580
Downloading Tinder and swiping a
couple of times is a lower bar.

00:54:03.580 --> 00:54:06.460
So I actually think that is
probably the major consequence

00:54:06.460 --> 00:54:09.820
that will happen for the
prevalence of these things

00:54:09.820 --> 00:54:11.260
for existing relationships.

00:54:11.260 --> 00:54:13.990
I think the major consequences
for those people who

00:54:13.990 --> 00:54:17.350
are considering
alternatives already,

00:54:17.350 --> 00:54:21.254
they're more likely to take
the first step down that road.

00:54:21.254 --> 00:54:23.170
LOGAN URY: We have time
for one more question.

00:54:23.170 --> 00:54:25.490
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:54:25.490 --> 00:54:28.125
OK, that really resonated
with me and great discussion.

00:54:28.125 --> 00:54:29.625
Something else that
really resonated

00:54:29.625 --> 00:54:32.430
is you're talking about
this idea that a lot of us

00:54:32.430 --> 00:54:34.980
want to be entrepreneurs,
but it's scary.

00:54:34.980 --> 00:54:38.450
And often, you kind of hope
your partner might support that.

00:54:38.450 --> 00:54:40.450
So I have a friend-- and
I don't mean, like, me,

00:54:40.450 --> 00:54:43.210
but an actual friend--

00:54:43.210 --> 00:54:46.260
who wanted to go and do her PhD.

00:54:46.260 --> 00:54:47.940
And her partner was
saying, no, that's

00:54:47.940 --> 00:54:52.680
sort of financially
irresponsible at your age.

00:54:52.680 --> 00:54:56.230
How might people kind of
resolve something like that?

00:54:56.230 --> 00:54:58.881
ELI FINKEL: Is she, like, four?

00:54:58.881 --> 00:55:00.130
AUDIENCE: 37.

00:55:00.130 --> 00:55:02.600
ELI FINKEL: I don't think
they are one size-- thank you.

00:55:02.600 --> 00:55:06.100
I'm grateful to you for
that belated laughter.

00:55:06.100 --> 00:55:09.890
Here, again, I mean, look.

00:55:09.890 --> 00:55:11.600
What he's saying isn't crazy.

00:55:11.600 --> 00:55:16.520
What he's saying would have
been totally reasonable in 1950.

00:55:16.520 --> 00:55:19.470
Well, actually, let's ignore
the gender implications.

00:55:19.470 --> 00:55:23.030
Because most women didn't get
PhDs in 1950, or most PhDs

00:55:23.030 --> 00:55:24.810
weren't awarded
to women in 1950,

00:55:24.810 --> 00:55:27.350
or achieved by women in 1950s.

00:55:27.350 --> 00:55:29.600
But this idea that
you're supposed

00:55:29.600 --> 00:55:32.060
to do what you're
obligated to do, to do

00:55:32.060 --> 00:55:34.550
the responsible thing, and
to set aside your hopes

00:55:34.550 --> 00:55:37.310
and aspirations is kind of
an older idea, isn't it?

00:55:37.310 --> 00:55:39.440
I mean, we could take
a poll of the people

00:55:39.440 --> 00:55:41.960
in the room or the
people watching online.

00:55:41.960 --> 00:55:43.880
My guess is that most
of us feel like he's

00:55:43.880 --> 00:55:47.120
being something of a barbarian,
that it's, like, not really

00:55:47.120 --> 00:55:51.166
reasonable to ask her to
forego something that really is

00:55:51.166 --> 00:55:52.790
self-expressive for
her, that really is

00:55:52.790 --> 00:55:55.662
essential to achieving the
best version of herself,

00:55:55.662 --> 00:55:56.870
her ideal version of herself.

00:55:56.870 --> 00:55:58.940
And it's cruel,
many of us think,

00:55:58.940 --> 00:56:04.959
to make her have a life where
she's going to have regrets

00:56:04.959 --> 00:56:06.500
that she didn't
achieve these things.

00:56:06.500 --> 00:56:07.760
Is that right or wrong?

00:56:07.760 --> 00:56:09.380
I don't know what
to say, other than,

00:56:09.380 --> 00:56:11.460
I'm glad we live in this era.

00:56:11.460 --> 00:56:15.290
And I'm glad that we have
the defaults toward ambition,

00:56:15.290 --> 00:56:16.940
and generosity,
and self-expression

00:56:16.940 --> 00:56:18.320
and personal growth
that we have.

00:56:18.320 --> 00:56:20.000
And each individual
couple is going

00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:22.400
to have to figure out the
circumstances under which they

00:56:22.400 --> 00:56:24.025
have to make those
sorts of sacrifices.

00:56:24.025 --> 00:56:25.700
And that's the best
I can do with regard

00:56:25.700 --> 00:56:27.380
to your particular situation.

00:56:27.380 --> 00:56:28.550
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:56:28.550 --> 00:56:31.070
LOGAN URY: So I'm also grateful
that we live in this era

00:56:31.070 --> 00:56:33.530
where we can have conversations
like this at work.

00:56:33.530 --> 00:56:36.320
And I really want to thank
all of you so much for coming.

00:56:36.320 --> 00:56:39.620
For those of you who
have a copy of the book,

00:56:39.620 --> 00:56:41.500
Eli's happy to personalize it.

00:56:41.500 --> 00:56:44.840
Eli and I also
collaborated on a video,

00:56:44.840 --> 00:56:46.470
which we put on Facebook today.

00:56:46.470 --> 00:56:50.700
So if you want to check it out,
it's at facebook.com/loganury,

00:56:50.700 --> 00:56:54.230
which is U-R-Y. And it's
a three-minute version

00:56:54.230 --> 00:56:55.355
of the history of marriage.

00:56:55.355 --> 00:56:56.396
So you should check that.

00:56:56.396 --> 00:56:58.250
Out you should also
buy Eli's great book,

00:56:58.250 --> 00:56:59.690
"The All-or-Nothing Marriage."

00:56:59.690 --> 00:57:02.880
And stay tuned for the next
Talks at Google Modern Romance

00:57:02.880 --> 00:57:03.380
Talk.

00:57:03.380 --> 00:57:04.720
So thank you so much.

00:57:04.720 --> 00:57:05.020
ELI FINKEL: Thank you.

00:57:05.020 --> 00:57:05.895
LOGAN URY: Thank you.

00:57:05.895 --> 00:57:06.870
ELI FINKEL: Thank you.
