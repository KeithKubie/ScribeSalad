00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
The answer is 0.008.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:09.000
At each step, there's a 1/5 probability of seeing that particular vote

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
at both stages and knowing how it was mixed.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
In order to trace the vote all the way back, we need to see that same vote each time.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:24.000
That will be 1/5^3rd which is 1/125 which is 0.008.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.000
So that means there's a tradeoff here, if you do more auditing, if you increase this from 1/5

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.000
to a higher value, that would increase the probability that a given voter could be identified.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
It will also decrease the probability that the mix nets could cheat without getting caught.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
So here, we have a tradeoff between the privacy of the voters

00:00:43.000 --> 99:59:59.000
and the likelihood of detecting cheating.
