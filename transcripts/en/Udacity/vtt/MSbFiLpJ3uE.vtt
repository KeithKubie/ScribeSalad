00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.270
This allele would be dominant, because you only need one copy of it to

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:05.550
start noticing an affect. Even if just

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:09.300
some of your ALDH2 enzymes have reduced activity,

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.310
that's going to lead to buildup of acetaldehyde,

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:15.730
which causes the phenotype of alcohol flush reaction.

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:19.800
So even a little bit of buildup is going to show us a phenotype that's dominant.
