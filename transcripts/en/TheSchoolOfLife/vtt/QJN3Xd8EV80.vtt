00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:07.660
It's not often discussed. We like to put
on a sunny facade

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:14.500
but behind closed doors many of us go in for one of the most tragicomic behaviors of relationships.

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:16.440
Sulking.

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.820
A sulk typically starts over a disappointment. Most often over an objectively

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.020
rather small matter. Lars didn't ask Mille how her day was.

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:28.540
Christine forgot to notice Laras new haircut.

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:32.080
Woori wasn't paying Chung Ho enough
attention at the party.

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:37.810
but what follows isn't an argument.

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:42.560
It's an eerie silence. A domestic cold-war where enquiries as to

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:47.040
"what's wrong?" are met with by one resolute
stony word

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.820
What is a sulk? It's made up of
two things;

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:57.100
disappointment and a deep-seated refusal to explain what the disappointment is about.

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.040
Why don't we tell our lovers what's upsetting us.

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:04.420
After all, we explain so many things to so many people in the course my lives.

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:08.090
We don't explain because of a peculiar
assumption

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:11.999
about the nature of love.

00:01:11.999 --> 00:01:16.170
Even people who are very good with words
might not when they're with their lover

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:22.800
be in the mood to explain very much. Where does this commitment silence come from.

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:25.220
It begins when we first learn
about love.

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.719
When we were tiny we couldn't and didn't
need to

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:32.659
make our intentions known directly to
those you loved us best.

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:35.780
They knew what we wanted to eat just
like that.

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:41.720
They made sure we were comfortable. They took the trouble to guess what we wanted.

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:43.660
This gave us a template

00:01:43.669 --> 00:01:46.939
but deeply unhelpful on 
about what adult love

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:51.009
might be like. In the early days of a
new relationship

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:54.539
there are some blissful moment twenty
people understand each other without

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:56.479
needing to stay very much.

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:59.759
The magically agree on things, they sense
a connection

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:05.799
unlike any other. But this is ultimately very misleading.

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:07.300
In truth all of us are

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:12.560
as adults bafflingly complicated.To
expect someone to understand us long-term

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.720
without us having to explain is
equivalent to expecting someone to work out

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:21.280
how nuclear fission works simply by
looking at the outside a power station.

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.000
For others not to understand this without
explanation

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:28.480
is no sign they're evil, just that they're
human.

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:32.360
Before retreating into a sulk we should
always do our partners the honour

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.500
of a small seminar. Part of love means accepting the need to teach

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.460
others in kind and patient ways about
who we are.

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:43.660
At the same time, when we unwittingly
unleash a sulk

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:46.660
we should realize that the sulker is
being strange in silent

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:50.300
not because they're mean but because at
heart they're scared.

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:53.440
They may be big and competent in many
areas

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:57.800
yet inside they must be feeling like a
defenseless baby in the hands of someone

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.340
who seems not to know how to look after
them.

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.520
The greatest gift we can give our lovers are

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:05.750
explanations as calm as we can make them

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:08.800
using lots of words about what we're
truly like

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:12.760
in all a madness complexity and
strangeness.
