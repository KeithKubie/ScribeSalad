00:00:40.973 --> 00:00:43.142 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Mike: HELL, YEAH.

00:00:43.175 --> 00:00:44.444 align:start position:0% line:85%
I'M EXCITED, LARRY!

00:00:44.477 --> 00:00:46.446 align:start position:0% line:91%
THIS IS A ONCE-IN-A-LIFETIME
OPPORTUNITY.

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:48.981 line:91%
IF YOU LISTEN TO MY CANDIDATE'S
STANCE ON ENTITLEMENT REFORM,

00:00:49.014 --> 00:00:50.015 align:start position:0% line:85%
HE...

WHAT MORE DO YOU WANT FROM A

00:00:59.391 --> 00:01:02.829 align:start position:0% line:91%

MAKE AMERICA BETTER?

00:01:05.231 --> 00:01:08.367 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Mike: YOU SOUND LIKE MARTIN
O'MALLEY.

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.735 size:81% position:41% line:85%
THAT DUDE'S POLLING AT 2%.

00:01:09.768 --> 00:01:10.636 align:start position:0% line:85%
YOU KNOW WHY, LARRY?

00:01:10.669 --> 00:01:12.371 align:start position:0% line:85%
NAME NON-RECOGNITION.

00:01:12.404 --> 00:01:14.474 line:91%
NOBODY CARES ABOUT ANYTHING HE
HAS TO SAY BECAUSE HIS NAME IS

00:01:14.507 --> 00:01:16.375 align:start position:0% line:85%
BORING.

00:01:16.408 --> 00:01:21.314 align:start position:0% line:91%

&gt;&gt; Ricky: THIS IS REALLY
CATCHING ON, LARRY.

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:49.175 align:start position:0% line:91%
IT LOOKS LIKE EVERYONE'S PULLING
FOR...

00:01:49.208 --> 00:01:54.947 align:start position:0% line:85%
DEEZ NUTS.

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:57.150 line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: OKAY, I THINK YOU'RE
JUST HAVING FUN SAYING THIS.

00:01:57.183 --> 00:01:58.651 line:85%

(LAUGHTER)
ALL YOU'RE DOING IS MAKING A

00:02:23.542 --> 00:02:24.076 align:start position:0% line:85%
JOKE OUT OF DEEZ NUTS.

00:02:24.109 --> 00:02:24.610 align:start position:0% line:85%

00:02:35.287 --> 00:02:37.190 line:85%
&gt;&gt; Larry: OH, YES, THANK YOU.

00:02:37.223 --> 00:02:38.558 align:start position:0% line:91%
HOLLY WALKER, EVERYBODY, COMING

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:49.301 align:start position:0% line:85%
I AGREE!

00:02:49.335 --> 00:02:50.403 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Holly: ONCE AGAIN, ALL OUR
POLITICAL DISCOURSE IS DOMINATED

00:02:50.436 --> 00:02:53.940 align:start position:0% line:91%
BY MALES AND THEIR LOCKER ROOM
SENSIBILITIES.

00:02:53.973 --> 00:02:56.709 align:start position:0% line:91%
WE'RE NOT HAVING A CONVERSATION
ABOUT ISSUES THAT MATTER.

00:02:56.742 --> 00:02:58.044 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: EXACTLY, HOLLY,
THAT'S MY POINT.

00:02:58.077 --> 00:03:02.648 align:start position:0% line:85%
THANK YOU.

00:03:02.681 --> 00:03:05.985 align:start position:0% line:85%

CANDIDATE YOU'RE MOST INTERESTED

00:03:08.654 --> 00:03:11.457 align:start position:0% line:85%
IN TALKING ABOUT?

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:12.858 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Holly: LARRY, THERE IS A
VERY EXCITING DARK HORSE OUT OF

00:03:12.891 --> 00:03:13.826 align:start position:0% line:85%
PENNSYLVANIA.

00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:14.827 align:start position:0% line:91%
SHE'S A FEMALE CANDIDATE WHO HAS
A LOT TO SAY.

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:21.901 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: GREAT, WHAT'S HER
NAME?

00:03:21.934 --> 00:03:25.037 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; DEEZ TITTIES!

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:27.073 align:start position:0% line:91%
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
&gt;&gt; Larry: OKAY.

00:03:27.106 --> 00:03:27.740 size:88% position:44% line:85%
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS, HOLLY.

00:03:27.773 --> 00:03:28.441 size:78% position:39% line:85%
NOW YOU'RE DOING IT, TOO?

00:03:28.474 --> 00:03:29.108 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Holly: NO, LARRY.

00:03:29.141 --> 00:03:29.942 align:start position:0% line:85%
I'M COMPLETELY SERIOUS.

00:03:29.975 --> 00:03:32.111 align:start position:0% line:91%
DEEZ TITTIES SPRANG OUTTA
NOWHERE.

00:03:32.144 --> 00:03:33.446 align:start position:0% line:91%

00:03:34.213 --> 00:03:35.414 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Holly: YES, LARRY.

00:03:35.448 --> 00:03:37.984 align:start position:0% line:91%
THE CAMPAIGN WAS SAGGING, BUT
NOW THEY'RE STARTING TO PICK UP,

00:03:38.017 --> 00:03:41.354 align:start position:0% line:91%
AND THEY'RE GETTING A LOT OF
SUPPORT.

00:03:41.387 --> 00:03:43.889 align:start position:0% line:91%
HER POLL NUMBERS ARE LIFTING AND
SEPARATING THROUGH THE SWING

00:03:43.922 --> 00:03:46.792 align:start position:0% line:85%
STATES.

00:03:46.825 --> 00:03:48.828 align:start position:0% line:91%
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
&gt;&gt; Larry: THAT DOESN'T EVEN

00:03:48.861 --> 00:03:50.229 align:start position:0% line:85%
MAKE SENSE!

00:03:50.262 --> 00:03:51.597 align:start position:0% line:91%
MIKE YARD, WHAT ARE YOU DOING

INFORMATION THAT DEEZ NUTS AND

00:04:04.443 --> 00:04:05.278 line:85%
DEEZ TITTIES ARE JOINING FORCES.

00:04:05.311 --> 00:04:06.145 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Larry: I KNOW.

00:04:06.178 --> 00:04:08.180 align:start position:0% line:85%
I'VE HEARD.

00:04:08.213 --> 00:04:08.747 align:start position:0% line:85%
OKAY.

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:09.448 size:75% position:38% line:85%
I'VE HAD ENOUGH OF THIS.

00:04:09.481 --> 00:04:10.249 line:85%

00:04:10.282 --> 00:04:11.615 align:start position:0% line:85%
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
