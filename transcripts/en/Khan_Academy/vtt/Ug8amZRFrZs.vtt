00:00:00.977 --> 00:00:03.240
- [Instructor] On July fourth, 1776,

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:05.963
the delegates to the
Second Continental Congress

00:00:05.963 --> 00:00:09.297
approved the Declaration of Independence.

00:00:09.297 --> 00:00:11.573
We know parts of it very well.

00:00:11.573 --> 00:00:12.479
For example,

00:00:12.479 --> 00:00:15.861
"We hold these truths to be self-evident,"

00:00:15.861 --> 00:00:17.763
"that all men are created equal."

00:00:17.763 --> 00:00:20.280
The Declaration of
Independence was really the

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:22.237
point of no return

00:00:22.237 --> 00:00:25.090
for the young United States of America,

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:27.866
making an appeal to the rest of the world,

00:00:27.866 --> 00:00:31.485
to say that their time as a
colony of the United Kingdom

00:00:31.485 --> 00:00:32.318
had ended.

00:00:33.191 --> 00:00:36.853
The principle author of the
Declaration of Independence

00:00:36.853 --> 00:00:39.853
was this man here, Thomas Jefferson.

00:00:40.788 --> 00:00:43.586
I tried to find a picture
of him as a young man.

00:00:43.586 --> 00:00:45.422
In fact, at the time,

00:00:45.422 --> 00:00:48.991
he was about 10 years younger
than you even see him here.

00:00:48.991 --> 00:00:49.824
He was 33.

00:00:52.421 --> 00:00:57.026
Where did young Thomas
Jefferson get all of the ideas

00:00:57.026 --> 00:01:00.693
that he expressed in the
Declaration of Independence,

00:01:00.693 --> 00:01:02.729
and what happened to those ideas,

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:04.584
once he put them down on paper?

00:01:04.584 --> 00:01:05.567
In this video,

00:01:05.567 --> 00:01:07.705
I'd like to explore some of the origins

00:01:07.705 --> 00:01:11.863
and effects of the
Declaration of Independence.

00:01:11.863 --> 00:01:15.670
We often think that the
Revolutionary War started

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:18.528
with the Declaration of Independence.

00:01:18.528 --> 00:01:20.965
We think of 1776 as being this

00:01:20.965 --> 00:01:24.369
opening moment of the Revolution.

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:28.762
In fact, parts of the
Revolutionary War had been going on

00:01:28.762 --> 00:01:30.225
for some time.

00:01:30.225 --> 00:01:33.876
It was in 1765, more
than a decade earlier,

00:01:33.876 --> 00:01:37.543
that some of the first
unrest over taxation,

00:01:39.599 --> 00:01:42.766
specifically the Stamp Act, had begun.

00:01:43.935 --> 00:01:47.132
In 1773, the famous Boston Tea Party,

00:01:47.132 --> 00:01:51.299
when a group of colonists
dumped over 300 crates of tea

00:01:52.329 --> 00:01:55.313
into Boston Harbor had happened.

00:01:55.313 --> 00:01:59.480
In 1775, over a year before the
Declaration of Independence,

00:02:01.644 --> 00:02:03.365
the first shots

00:02:03.365 --> 00:02:07.532
of the Revolutionary War had
taken place outside Boston,

00:02:08.924 --> 00:02:11.749
at the towns of Lexington and Concord.

00:02:11.749 --> 00:02:15.445
By the time the delegates
had met in Philadelphia,

00:02:15.445 --> 00:02:18.254
the Revolutionary War
had been a shooting war

00:02:18.254 --> 00:02:20.212
for more than a year.

00:02:20.212 --> 00:02:22.879
Why was it that in July of 1776,

00:02:24.704 --> 00:02:28.762
the delegates finally made the
Declaration of Independence?

00:02:28.762 --> 00:02:30.640
The primary reason that
they did it at this time,

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.057
was because they wanted help,

00:02:35.998 --> 00:02:40.165
and they were particularly
eager to get the assistance

00:02:41.534 --> 00:02:43.531
of the nation of France,

00:02:43.531 --> 00:02:48.322
which had been a long time
enemy of the United Kingdom,

00:02:48.322 --> 00:02:51.899
and the delegates really knew that the new

00:02:51.899 --> 00:02:55.165
United States of America
would have no hope of winning

00:02:55.165 --> 00:02:59.332
a war against a massive imperial
power like Great Britain,

00:03:00.168 --> 00:03:04.335
without the help of another
world power, such as France.

00:03:05.234 --> 00:03:07.498
In a way, what Jefferson was doing in the

00:03:07.498 --> 00:03:09.066
Declaration of Independence,

00:03:09.066 --> 00:03:12.983
wasn't so much declaring,
but rather explaining

00:03:15.361 --> 00:03:19.121
why the states were declaring
themselves independent,

00:03:19.121 --> 00:03:21.767
with the hope that they
could get the sympathy

00:03:21.767 --> 00:03:25.364
and the help of the
international community.

00:03:25.364 --> 00:03:28.425
Let's read some of the
Declaration of Independence.

00:03:28.425 --> 00:03:31.760
I know that this is a
gigantic block of text here,

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:33.126
but bear with me.

00:03:33.126 --> 00:03:34.664
We'll grow through it fairly quickly.

00:03:34.664 --> 00:03:36.993
"The unanimous Declaration
of the thirteen"

00:03:36.993 --> 00:03:39.536
"United States of America."

00:03:39.536 --> 00:03:42.267
You'll notice here that
he specifically points out

00:03:42.267 --> 00:03:45.130
that there are 13 United States.

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:49.126
This is important, because
it gives you a sense that

00:03:49.126 --> 00:03:52.802
they aren't really thinking
of the individual former

00:03:52.802 --> 00:03:56.627
colonies, now states,
as one larger country,

00:03:56.627 --> 00:04:00.026
but rather as a collection of states,

00:04:00.026 --> 00:04:02.883
a confederation of allied states,

00:04:02.883 --> 00:04:05.732
instead of a single nation.

00:04:05.732 --> 00:04:08.932
"When in the course of human
events it becomes necessary"

00:04:08.932 --> 00:04:12.353
"for one people to dissolve
the political bands"

00:04:12.353 --> 00:04:14.534
"which have connected them with another"

00:04:14.534 --> 00:04:17.382
"and to assume among the
powers of the Earth,"

00:04:17.382 --> 00:04:18.667
"the separate and equal"

00:04:18.667 --> 00:04:20.688
"station to which the laws of nature,"

00:04:20.688 --> 00:04:22.689
"and of nature's God entitle them."

00:04:22.689 --> 00:04:25.268
"A decent respect to the
opinions of mankind requires"

00:04:25.268 --> 00:04:28.321
"that they should declare
the causes which impel them"

00:04:28.321 --> 00:04:30.199
"to the separation."

00:04:30.199 --> 00:04:33.187
Here's this explanation part,

00:04:33.187 --> 00:04:37.703
saying, we feel it necessary
to explain why we want to

00:04:37.703 --> 00:04:39.631
separate from Great Britain.

00:04:39.631 --> 00:04:43.121
"We hold these truths to be self-evident."

00:04:43.121 --> 00:04:45.205
"That all men are created equal,"

00:04:45.205 --> 00:04:47.153
"that they are endowed by their Creator"

00:04:47.153 --> 00:04:49.216
"with certain unalienable rights,"

00:04:49.216 --> 00:04:51.335
"that among these are life, liberty,"

00:04:51.335 --> 00:04:53.829
"and the pursuit of happiness."

00:04:53.829 --> 00:04:55.966
"That to secure these rights,"

00:04:55.966 --> 00:04:58.067
"governments are instituted among men,"

00:04:58.067 --> 00:04:59.895
"deriving their just powers from the"

00:04:59.895 --> 00:05:02.394
"consent of the governed."

00:05:02.394 --> 00:05:05.357
"That whenever any form of
government becomes destructive"

00:05:05.357 --> 00:05:06.584
"of these ends,"

00:05:06.584 --> 00:05:09.162
"it is the right of the people to alter,"

00:05:09.162 --> 00:05:10.723
"or to abolish it,"

00:05:10.723 --> 00:05:12.363
"and to institute new government,"

00:05:12.363 --> 00:05:15.892
"laying its foundation on such
principles and organizing"

00:05:15.892 --> 00:05:17.773
"its powers in such form,"

00:05:17.773 --> 00:05:20.262
"as to them shall seem
most likely to effect"

00:05:20.262 --> 00:05:22.605
"their safety and happiness."

00:05:22.605 --> 00:05:26.350
I think this might be the
most important passage

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:28.298
of the Declaration of Independence,

00:05:28.298 --> 00:05:29.891
and let me tell you why.

00:05:29.891 --> 00:05:31.806
In this paragraph, you can really see the

00:05:31.806 --> 00:05:35.973
influence of the Enlightenment
on Jefferson's thought.

00:05:37.321 --> 00:05:41.488
The Enlightenment was a
period in the 1600s and 1700s,

00:05:42.981 --> 00:05:45.314
when people began to explore

00:05:48.677 --> 00:05:50.510
scientific observation

00:05:52.187 --> 00:05:53.104
and reason.

00:05:54.845 --> 00:05:57.995
They became more interested
in observing the world

00:05:57.995 --> 00:06:01.376
around them, and trying to make

00:06:01.376 --> 00:06:04.543
reasoned arguments from what they saw,

00:06:05.465 --> 00:06:10.277
as compared to accepting
the religious explanations

00:06:10.277 --> 00:06:12.291
for how the world worked.

00:06:12.291 --> 00:06:14.547
During the Enlightenment,
many philosophers began to

00:06:14.547 --> 00:06:16.797
rethink government as well,

00:06:18.998 --> 00:06:22.482
and of questioning whether
the governmental system

00:06:22.482 --> 00:06:27.085
in Europe and other places
was the right system.

00:06:27.085 --> 00:06:28.829
There was one philosopher, in particular,

00:06:28.829 --> 00:06:32.643
who really captured
Jefferson's imagination,

00:06:32.643 --> 00:06:35.116
and his name was John Locke.

00:06:35.116 --> 00:06:38.283
John Lcoke was an English philosopher,

00:06:40.048 --> 00:06:42.139
who had lived in the 1600s,

00:06:42.139 --> 00:06:45.162
and he wrote a book that
had really influenced

00:06:45.162 --> 00:06:48.581
Jefferson and many thinkers
in this time period,

00:06:48.581 --> 00:06:51.498
called Two Treatises on Government.

00:06:54.850 --> 00:06:59.017
There are two really important
points in Locke's work.

00:07:00.035 --> 00:07:02.952
One was the idea of natural rights.

00:07:05.859 --> 00:07:09.095
What Locke meant by natural rights,

00:07:09.095 --> 00:07:12.771
are rights that were endowed by nature,

00:07:12.771 --> 00:07:16.169
that all people were born with.

00:07:16.169 --> 00:07:19.199
If you think about Europe
in this time period,

00:07:19.199 --> 00:07:22.699
there was a sense that
some people were born with

00:07:22.699 --> 00:07:24.816
more rights than others.

00:07:24.816 --> 00:07:28.983
In fact, there was the idea
of the Divine Right of Kings,

00:07:29.859 --> 00:07:31.026
that the king,

00:07:33.517 --> 00:07:35.434
or monarch of any sort,

00:07:36.319 --> 00:07:40.152
had been born the king
because God wanted that

00:07:42.354 --> 00:07:43.604
person to rule.

00:07:44.587 --> 00:07:46.892
Locke rejects that.

00:07:46.892 --> 00:07:49.483
He says when people are born,

00:07:49.483 --> 00:07:51.478
they're all born the same,

00:07:51.478 --> 00:07:56.460
and they all have rights
that can't be given away,

00:07:56.460 --> 00:07:58.593
that are unalienable,

00:07:58.593 --> 00:08:00.722
and those are life,

00:08:00.722 --> 00:08:01.555
liberty,

00:08:03.279 --> 00:08:04.362
and property.

00:08:05.735 --> 00:08:08.807
Sounds pretty familiar, doesn't it?

00:08:08.807 --> 00:08:11.688
The other important idea that Locke had,

00:08:11.688 --> 00:08:14.688
was the idea of the Social Contract.

00:08:17.263 --> 00:08:20.304
The idea of the Social Contract was that,

00:08:20.304 --> 00:08:23.162
government came from the people,

00:08:23.162 --> 00:08:26.382
that society members got together,

00:08:26.382 --> 00:08:30.689
and agreed on what the forms
of government should be,

00:08:30.689 --> 00:08:33.852
so that the only just government,

00:08:33.852 --> 00:08:36.739
was one that took into
account the opinions

00:08:36.739 --> 00:08:39.594
of the people who live within it.

00:08:39.594 --> 00:08:41.288
You see that here, too.

00:08:41.288 --> 00:08:43.530
"Governments are instituted among men,"

00:08:43.530 --> 00:08:45.780
"deriving their just powers from"

00:08:45.780 --> 00:08:47.857
"the consent of the governed."

00:08:47.857 --> 00:08:50.434
There's a third thing
that Locke suggests that

00:08:50.434 --> 00:08:53.003
Jefferson also gets at,

00:08:53.003 --> 00:08:56.126
which is that when
governments become tyrannical,

00:08:56.126 --> 00:08:59.683
when they do not abide
by the Social Contract,

00:08:59.683 --> 00:09:02.933
it is the right of the people to rebel.

00:09:05.501 --> 00:09:08.095
All right, back to the Declaration.

00:09:08.095 --> 00:09:11.017
Most of the rest of the
Declaration is just a list

00:09:11.017 --> 00:09:14.454
of grievances of what the King has done

00:09:14.454 --> 00:09:17.703
to the colonies that has
made them very angry.

00:09:17.703 --> 00:09:21.144
This is an extremely
abridged list of them.

00:09:21.144 --> 00:09:24.092
I highly recommend you read
the entire Declaration,

00:09:24.092 --> 00:09:26.440
'cause I think it gives
you a really good sense

00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:31.402
of what the colonists were
thinking at this time period.

00:09:31.402 --> 00:09:33.309
Here are some of the highlights.

00:09:33.309 --> 00:09:35.241
Jefferson says that the

00:09:35.241 --> 00:09:38.001
"King has kept among
us, in times of peace,"

00:09:38.001 --> 00:09:41.675
"standing armies without the
consent of our legislatures."

00:09:41.675 --> 00:09:45.678
Those are the British regulars
who have been stationed in

00:09:45.678 --> 00:09:48.178
North America for a long time.

00:09:50.955 --> 00:09:55.299
"For cutting off our trade
with all parts of the world."

00:09:55.299 --> 00:09:59.586
The Navigation Acts,
that said the colonies

00:09:59.586 --> 00:10:02.586
could only trade with Great Britain.

00:10:05.222 --> 00:10:08.845
"For imposing taxes on
us, without our consent."

00:10:08.845 --> 00:10:11.335
The idea of taxation
without representation,

00:10:11.335 --> 00:10:15.168
which really motivated
the colonists to rebel.

00:10:19.983 --> 00:10:22.251
And so forth and so on.

00:10:22.251 --> 00:10:25.955
Now, it's worth noting that the
Declaration of Independence,

00:10:25.955 --> 00:10:30.103
as an explanation hoping
to get France on the side

00:10:30.103 --> 00:10:32.474
of the new United States,

00:10:32.474 --> 00:10:33.998
worked very well.

00:10:33.998 --> 00:10:37.821
The United States allied with France,

00:10:37.821 --> 00:10:41.988
which led them to win the
Revolutionary War in 1783.

00:10:48.083 --> 00:10:50.377
As we close, it's worth pondering,

00:10:50.377 --> 00:10:52.713
what it was that Thomas Jefferson

00:10:52.713 --> 00:10:55.100
really meant by the phrase,

00:10:55.100 --> 00:10:57.479
"All men are created equal."

00:10:57.479 --> 00:11:00.053
The Revolutionary War
didn't abolish slavery

00:11:00.053 --> 00:11:01.469
in the United States.

00:11:01.469 --> 00:11:06.154
In fact, Jefferson himself
owned over 100 enslaved

00:11:06.154 --> 00:11:08.366
people of African descent.

00:11:08.366 --> 00:11:12.092
When Jefferson said, "All
men are created equal,"

00:11:12.092 --> 00:11:15.259
was he thinking only of all white men?

00:11:16.878 --> 00:11:19.834
Was he thinking only of elite white men?

00:11:19.834 --> 00:11:23.125
After all, after the Revolution,

00:11:23.125 --> 00:11:27.292
only a handful of propertied
elite men could vote.

00:11:29.689 --> 00:11:33.022
But then, there's this larger idea here.

00:11:33.940 --> 00:11:38.213
He's saying that your
ordinary man wasn't born

00:11:38.213 --> 00:11:41.489
any different than someone
who was born a king,

00:11:41.489 --> 00:11:44.303
so why should someone who was born black

00:11:44.303 --> 00:11:47.153
be different than someone
who was born white?

00:11:47.153 --> 00:11:50.116
It's hard to imagine how
Jefferson separated those things

00:11:50.116 --> 00:11:51.557
in his mind.

00:11:51.557 --> 00:11:54.229
Certainly, others at the time period,

00:11:54.229 --> 00:11:57.571
realized that there was
an inherent contradiction

00:11:57.571 --> 00:11:59.477
between slavery,

00:11:59.477 --> 00:12:02.229
and also between the rights of women,

00:12:02.229 --> 00:12:05.176
and the idea that all
men are created equal.

00:12:05.176 --> 00:12:07.748
Over time, the rhetoric of the
Declaration of Independence

00:12:07.748 --> 00:12:10.945
would go on to spur many
different movements for

00:12:10.945 --> 00:12:13.455
independence and civil rights.

00:12:13.455 --> 00:12:16.203
The most notable of which
being the French Revolution,

00:12:16.203 --> 00:12:19.536
which took much of its rhetoric from the

00:12:20.556 --> 00:12:22.553
American Revolution.

00:12:22.553 --> 00:12:26.748
Later, in 1848, the first
women's rights movement

00:12:26.748 --> 00:12:29.648
would gather at Seneca Falls, New York,

00:12:29.648 --> 00:12:31.195
and release what they called

00:12:31.195 --> 00:12:34.359
the Declaration of Sentiments.

00:12:34.359 --> 00:12:38.526
Which began, "All men and
women are created equal."

00:12:40.853 --> 00:12:42.902
So Jefferson's ideas here,

00:12:42.902 --> 00:12:45.089
are both deeply radical,

00:12:45.089 --> 00:12:50.053
insisting that ordinary people
are just as good as kings,

00:12:50.053 --> 00:12:51.460
and even more,

00:12:51.460 --> 00:12:55.120
entitled to decide their
own form of government.

00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:58.977
But that Revolution only went so far.

00:12:58.977 --> 00:13:02.394
It didn't change much about the status of

00:13:03.525 --> 00:13:07.217
every day citizens in the United States.

00:13:07.217 --> 00:13:09.782
But it put forward an ideal which

00:13:09.782 --> 00:13:12.191
we've been working toward ever since.
