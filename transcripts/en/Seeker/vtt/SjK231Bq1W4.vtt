00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.800
Dude! Why don't we take all that excess nuclear waste to the sun? Why don't we do that?

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:11.200
 

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.200
Hey Earthlings! Welcome to DNews. I'm

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.200
Trace. Nuclear waste is

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:17.200
a rough topic. It's part of the reason

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.200
people are opposed to nuclear

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:21.200
power. We're getting electricity today, sure,

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.200
but we're creating something that could pollute

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.200
for centuries. People ain't

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.200
onboard with that. We got a question on our Facebook

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:29.200
page, from Kody Vincent, asking exactly

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.200
what I've been wondering since that crappy

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.200
Superman: Quest for Peace movie.

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.200
He wants to know if we can launch nuclear

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.200
waste into the sun.

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.200
I love this idea, Kody. Seriously, thanks

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.200
for asking. The sun's life giving heat

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.200
and light are a result of a constant

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.200
nuclear fusion reaction. If we were able

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.200
to safely send the nuclear material

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.200
towards the sun, it would burn up.

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.200
Honestly, it would never even come close to the sun;

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.200
It would burn up long before it got there. But that's not

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.200
the point. Can we shoot it at the sun?

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.200
Sure! Will we? No!

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.200
When you picture nuclear waste,

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.200
you probably think of the Simpsons and picture

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.200
glowing rods or bubbling green goop.

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.200
But nuclear waste is actually an umbrella

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.200
term for a bunch of different things. Sure, actual

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.200
nuclear rods but also, clothing

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.200
and tools used in radioactive areas,

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.200
and even spare parts exposed to the radiation.

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.200
Of that, only 3% is

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.200
high level radioactive material

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.200
and that's the only bit we'd be launching.

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.200
In 1999, the Space Studies Institute

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.200
looked at the space disposal of high level

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.200
material. According to their assessment,

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.200
by 2020, there will

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.000
be over 77,000 lbs

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
of spent nuclear fuel rods

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
alone on earth. Space access is

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
expensive at thousands of dollars a pound,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
so it's a bit prohibitive cost wise.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Even if money were no object, space

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
technology has only existed for a little while, and

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
it's not perfect. NASA's missions do

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
fail occasionally. Go search for the Orbiting

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Carbon Observatory. It crashed

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
into the ocean, like 17 minutes

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
after takeoff. That's real crappy if it's a satellite.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
It's horrendous if it's

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
high level nuclear material. And so far, we have

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
not even scratched the surface of the

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
problems with this idea, which makes me kind of sad,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
because I was excited about it. Not only would we have

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
to get into space safely, we'd have to cancel

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
the orbital velocity of the earth.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Earth is moving real fast, you guys,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
and though the sun is big, it's not

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
so big that we couldn't miss if we

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
shot at it. The amount of energy

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
that it would take to cancel out Earth's

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
orbital velocity and then aim for the sun

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
would be astronomically high. We'd

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
be better off using the rocket engines

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
to kill it with fire once we

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
got it into space. Maybe if we had a

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
Superman who could safely transport

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
nuclear material directly into the sun, sure. Maybe.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
But how much do you trust a guy with underwear

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
on the outside of his pants? How do

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
you feel about this? Betrayed? Relieved?

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
