00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:01.610
- [Narrator] It's hard to imagine

00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:05.040
anything more transformative
in American history

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:06.530
than the Civil War.

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:08.410
Before the Civil War, the United States

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:12.350
was a largely rural, barely
unified collection of states

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:15.000
not making much of a
blip on the world stage.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.080
After the Civil War the United
States was well on its way

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:20.130
toward becoming a modern country

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:21.710
with a strong central government

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:23.900
and a thriving industrial economy

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.640
that was soon to make it
into a serious world power.

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.520
The Civil War is seen as such
an enormous turning point

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:33.220
in US history that most
colleges split courses

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:38.220
into US history before 1865
and US history after 1865.

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:42.340
But was the United States
really that different

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:44.250
before and after the Civil War?

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.290
As historians, we could
tackle that question

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:48.040
from a lot of different angles.

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.380
We could look at the role
of the federal government

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:52.790
in American life before and after the war.

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:55.050
We could look at changes in the economy.

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.630
I'm curious about changes in
American national identity

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:00.950
during this period.

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:03.060
What do I mean by national identity?

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:05.190
National identity encompasses things

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:09.560
like core beliefs about
democracy, citizenship,

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.500
and America's proper role in the world.

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.160
We can identify these beliefs
in different time periods

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:17.060
by looking at practices like

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:18.370
who gets to vote,

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:22.250
which groups are defined as
a part of the American people

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:25.620
versus which groups are
defined as aliens or others,

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:28.230
and whether the American
public is expressing

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:31.160
lots of national pride or lots of doubt

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:32.690
about the way things are going.

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:35.340
So now we've got a historical question

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:36.750
that we're curious about.

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.200
If we saw that question
like this on an exam

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:40.670
it might say something like

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.180
compare the relative
significance of the effects

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:47.090
of the Civil War on American values.

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.970
Okay, well what we're
really doing is asking,

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:54.290
how much did the Civil War
change the core beliefs

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:56.270
around American national identity?

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:58.630
Did it change some more than others?

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:01.210
To answer this question,
first we need to decide

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:03.600
which core beliefs we want to track.

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.640
I'm gonna choose ideas around democracy.

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:08.320
So who gets to vote,

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:10.510
whether Americans believe that democracy

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:12.750
is something everyone
should participate in

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.770
or just a select few?

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:17.530
Second, let's look at
ideas around citizenship.

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:19.620
Who is defined as an American

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.800
or as part of the American people

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.540
and entitled to the
privileges and immunities

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:25.690
of citizenship.

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:30.120
Last, let's look at ideas about
America's role in the world.

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.010
Whether or how the United
States should be involved

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:35.770
in world affairs or
extending its influence

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:37.950
beyond the boundaries
of the United States.

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.370
Now you might want to look
at different core beliefs

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:41.450
than I've chosen here

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:44.800
like maybe whether people
saw their regional identity

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.440
as more important than
their national identity.

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:50.060
And if you want to do
that that's totally okay.

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:52.710
I'm gonna go with these
three themes for now.

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:56.200
So let's brainstorm
some of the major trends

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.610
that occur in each of these themes

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:03.610
before and after the Civil
War in between 1844 and 1877.

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:07.150
I've got our timeline here
with the big dividing line

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:08.570
at the end of the Civil War.

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:11.200
Now we're looking at this
from a bird's eye view

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.400
of the whole era so I'm not
gonna go into much detail

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.030
about the events we're talking about.

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:19.360
If something sounds unfamiliar
to you just make a note of it

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:21.350
and you can go back to review that concept

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:22.340
when you have time.

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:24.350
All right, first democracy.

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:26.450
In the years before the Civil War,

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:28.930
what were the prevailing ideas about

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:30.480
who should be able to vote

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.930
and who actually could vote in practice?

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:36.210
Well by 1844, most States
had extended voting rights

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:39.440
to all white men regardless
of property ownership,

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:40.760
women couldn't vote

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:43.280
and neither could enslaved
Africans in the South,

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:46.580
and voting rights for free
African American men in the North

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:47.840
were pretty limited.

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:49.437
How about after the Civil War?

00:03:49.437 --> 00:03:50.780
Now the biggest change there

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:54.480
was the ratification of
the 15th Amendment in 1870

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.450
which granted all men the right to vote

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:59.110
enfranchising African American men.

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:01.150
It did not, to the disappointment

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:03.770
of the women's suffrage
movement, enfranchise women

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:07.620
but by 1877, the end of Reconstruction

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:09.070
when the federal government stopped

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:11.620
enforcing the rights of
black citizens in the South,

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:13.340
Jim Crow laws would make voting

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:15.470
all but impossible for black men.

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:18.610
Okay, now let's look at how
values around citizenship

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:21.130
changed before and after the Civil War.

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:23.630
Who was a citizen before the Civil War

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:25.470
and who was considered eligible

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:27.540
to be part of the American people?

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:29.900
Well white men definitely and white women,

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:31.590
free people of color in the North

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:34.780
with some limitations depending
on their state of residents,

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:37.110
immigrants arriving
from Ireland and Germany

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:38.860
were eligible for citizenship

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:41.390
but Native Americans were
considered to be members

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:44.090
of separate nations not Americans.

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:45.990
Mexican Americans and the territories

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:47.730
acquired in the Mexican Cession

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:49.870
were technically American citizens

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:52.300
but had few legal protections.

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:54.080
And enslaved people in the South

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:56.910
were still considered
property not citizens.

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:59.030
How did that change after the Civil War?

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:02.330
Well the Emancipation Proclamation in 1863

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:05.930
and the 13th Amendment
in 1865 ended slavery.

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:09.400
The 14th Amendment in 1868 made all people

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:13.010
born or naturalized in the
United States citizens,

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:15.350
granting citizenship
to African American men

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:16.830
and women in the South.

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:19.030
But again, the end of Reconstruction

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:21.580
and the rise of Jim Crow
made it difficult for them

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:25.230
to access the rights of
citizenship after 1877.

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:28.930
White men and women and
immigrants were still citizens.

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:32.070
The US government began to
stop treating Native Americans

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:34.070
as members of separate nations

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:37.500
but started classifying
them as wards of the state

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:38.900
rather than citizens.

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:41.470
In the West, Chinese
immigrants were looked upon

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:44.550
as two different to become citizens

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:45.940
and they would soon be forbidden

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:47.850
from entering the United States at all.

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:50.370
Mexican Americans saw little change

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:52.320
in their precarious status.

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:55.940
Finally, how did Americans
view the proper role

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:57.480
of the United States in the world

00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:59.520
before and after the Civil War?

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:03.580
In 1844, the US was still
practicing isolationism

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:06.780
to avoid entangling alliances abroad

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:10.090
but the ideas of manifest
destiny led to a general sense

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:12.790
that the United States
had a divine mission

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:15.450
to occupy North America
from coast to coast

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:18.260
which provided the impetus
for the Mexican War

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:19.750
and for Indian Removal.

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:22.140
After the Civil War, both isolationism

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:24.820
as a foreign policy outside North America

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:27.580
and manifest destiny as a foreign policy

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:30.810
within North America
continued on as before.

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:33.010
So now let's return to our question,

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:35.810
how much did the Civil War change

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:37.480
American national identity?

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:39.790
In terms of ideas about democracy

00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:42.530
there was definitely a big
expansion of the franchise

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:43.810
due to the Civil War

00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:46.930
with the addition of two
million African American men

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:48.600
as new voters in the South

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:51.070
after the ratification
of the 15th Amendment.

00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:52.980
But that was short-lived.

00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:54.970
The Jim Crow system would effectively

00:06:54.970 --> 00:06:58.150
prevent black voters in the
South from casting ballots

00:06:58.150 --> 00:06:59.680
until the 1960s.

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:02.410
In terms of citizenship,
that too was altered

00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:04.710
by the passage of a
constitutional amendment.

00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:06.570
In this case, the 14th Amendment.

00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:10.430
Those citizenship guarantees
were also short-lived

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:13.250
but let's not forget
the long-term importance

00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:15.430
of the 14th and 15th Amendments

00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:18.580
for securing equal rights
in the 20th century.

00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:20.680
Even though those rights
were only on paper

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:22.140
during the Jim Crow era

00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:24.530
that paper would eventually
be very important

00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:26.830
for expanding voting
and citizenship rights

00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:28.100
after World War II.

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:31.100
As for ideas about
America's role in the world,

00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:32.720
those didn't change much at all.

00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:35.280
The drive to expand the
borders of the United States

00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:36.670
all the way to the Pacific

00:07:36.670 --> 00:07:39.020
only intensified after the Civil War.

00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:40.840
So we might answer our question

00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:43.050
with the following thesis statement.

00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:46.850
The Civil War brought on some
immediate short-term changes

00:07:46.850 --> 00:07:50.290
in American ideals of
democracy and citizenship,

00:07:50.290 --> 00:07:53.380
which would fade after
the end of Reconstruction,

00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:56.130
while the belief in the divine
mission of the United States

00:07:56.130 --> 00:07:59.000
to spread across North
America only intensified

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:00.080
in this time period.

00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:03.130
Even though there was little
change in the 19th century,

00:08:03.130 --> 00:08:06.040
the seeds planted immediately
after the Civil War

00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:09.470
would sprout into major
changes in the 20th century.

00:08:09.470 --> 00:08:10.320
What do you think?

00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:12.780
How would you weigh
these pieces of evidence

00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:14.390
to draw conclusions about

00:08:14.390 --> 00:08:16.820
how the Civil War changed American values?

00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:17.680
You might come up with

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:20.250
a completely different
thesis statement than I did

00:08:20.250 --> 00:08:21.520
and that's perfectly fine.

00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:23.970
The important part of
thinking like a historian

00:08:23.970 --> 00:08:26.820
is to gather evidence and
then craft an argument

00:08:26.820 --> 00:08:28.353
supported by that evidence.
