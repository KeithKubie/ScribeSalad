00:00:01.855 --> 00:00:03.230
LAURENCE MORONEY:
Hey, everybody.

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:05.280
Hope you're still
enjoying I/O. Today I'm

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:07.815
going to be chatting within
Anil, who's the head of Photos.

00:00:07.815 --> 00:00:09.690
And he showed us this
really cool photo stuff

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:10.887
during the keynote.

00:00:10.887 --> 00:00:12.720
So Anil, welcome to
"Coffee with a Googler."

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:13.160
ANIL SABHARWA:
Thank you, Laurence.

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.670
It's great to be here.

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:14.190
LAURENCE MORONEY:
Thanks for coming.

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:15.330
Now one of the things that
you were talking about

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:16.980
was really taking control
of your digital life,

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.070
taking control of your photos.

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:18.430
ANIL SABHARWA: Absolutely.

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:19.690
LAURENCE MORONEY: Can you
tell us all about that?

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:20.360
ANIL SABHARWA: Yeah, for sure.

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:21.570
It's really funny.

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.200
I often say to
people, it's 2015.

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:25.930
We have cars that
drive themselves.

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:26.310
LAURENCE MORONEY: Yes, we do.

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.570
ANIL SABHARWA: We've got
drones delivering packages.

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:32.520
But if I want to store or find
my photos, share 20 of them

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.629
with you, it's the unsolved
problem of our time.

00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:38.170
And so when we talk
about taking back

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:39.628
control of your
digital lives, it's

00:00:39.628 --> 00:00:42.820
really about how we're in
this information overload.

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:44.390
And we're with
Photos really trying

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:47.670
to do what Gmail did
for email-- really

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.070
make it just easy for you
to be able to not have

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.210
to worry about your photos.

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.290
Have peace of mind that
they're safely backed up

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:55.040
and you can access
then whenever you want.

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.840
Make it really easy to be able
to find that photo so you don't

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.979
have to scroll forever,
and be able to make really

00:00:59.979 --> 00:01:02.270
great moments, and then
obviously be able to share them

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.720
really easily.

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:03.240
LAURENCE MORONEY: Sure.

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:05.300
And it gives you this
home for photos, right?

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.600
So instead of some photos
being on this device

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.550
and I forgot to back these ones
up and I backed those ones up,

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:13.190
it's this one single repository
where I can keep all my photos.

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.730
ANIL SABHARWA: Exactly.

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:16.188
And we want to make it such
that you can pick up any device

00:01:16.188 --> 00:01:18.820
and you can have access to all
of your photos instantly there.

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:20.760
You don't have to worry about,
oh is that one on my iPhone,

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:21.760
or is that one on
my Android, or is

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:23.185
that one on my home computer?

00:01:23.185 --> 00:01:26.046
You just have your entire
life of memories on any device

00:01:26.046 --> 00:01:28.170
that you pick up and go
into the Google Photos app.

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:28.500
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK.

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.333
Now one of the things
you were showing today

00:01:30.333 --> 00:01:32.295
was just how easy it is
to share these photos.

00:01:32.295 --> 00:01:34.480
And people don't
need a different app

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:36.550
to get into them or
a permissions link.

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:38.080
How does all that work?

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:40.350
ANIL SABHARWA: So we want
to make sharing really easy.

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.570
And I have this with
my wife all the time.

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.820
So, you know, she takes a
bunch of photos of the kids.

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.340
I take a bunch of
photos of the kids.

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.400
And we're trying to exchange
photos because we all

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:49.399
want to hold on to them.

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:50.490
We all want them together.

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.510
And normally you have to
share them in some way

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:56.214
or with some app, and then you
download and then you reupload.

00:01:56.214 --> 00:01:58.130
And so with Google Photos,
we said, let's just

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:59.230
make it really simple.

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:02.040
So we make it so you can just
select all of the photos really

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.345
easily, say Grab a Link.

00:02:03.345 --> 00:02:04.720
You can send that
link to anyone.

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:06.740
It's a really secure link.

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:09.300
But anyone who has it can
get access to the photos

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:10.600
and see that content.

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.210
And they can just
tap one button,

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:13.850
and all of those
photos and videos

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:15.910
are immediately copied
into their libraries.

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:16.290
LAURENCE MORONEY: Nice.

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:16.790
Nice.

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:18.580
Now do they need
to have a Google

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:20.950
ID at least to be able to
sign in to get that storage?

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:22.730
ANIL SABHARWA: If they want to
be able to copy those photos

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:24.396
and videos into their
library, then they

00:02:24.396 --> 00:02:26.530
need a Google Photos library,
which means they just

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:28.412
need a standard Google account.

00:02:28.412 --> 00:02:30.370
But if they want to just
view the contents-- so

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:32.578
if I want to take the photos
and I want to share them

00:02:32.578 --> 00:02:34.220
to, you know, my
kids' grandparents

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:36.095
and I want them to be
able to just access it,

00:02:36.095 --> 00:02:37.386
I don't have to worry about it.

00:02:37.386 --> 00:02:38.926
I can just send
it over SMS even.

00:02:38.926 --> 00:02:40.050
They can click on the link.

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:41.980
And immediately they'll just
see all the beautiful photos

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:42.480
and videos.

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:43.290
LAURENCE MORONEY:
That's really cool.

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:44.814
And if I'm a Google
Drive user, I

00:02:44.814 --> 00:02:46.730
can see all of this in
my Google Drive, right?

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:47.440
ANIL SABHARWA: Exactly.

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:50.160
And that's why we wanted to make
sure between Drive and Photos,

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.025
it doesn't matter which
door you come into,

00:02:52.025 --> 00:02:53.650
ultimately it's your
photos and videos.

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:55.650
You should have them
accessible in either place.

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.820
So photos you put in Drive
can show up in Photos,

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:00.224
and photos that are in Google
Photos are available to you

00:03:00.224 --> 00:03:00.890
in Google Drive.

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:01.150
LAURENCE MORONEY: Right.

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:02.996
And I have 15 gigabytes
of storage in Drive,

00:03:02.996 --> 00:03:05.120
but I don't need to worry
about all those gigabytes

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:06.450
and pictures because
it's unlimited.

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:06.660
ANIL SABHARWA: Yeah.

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:08.570
Well, so we have essentially
two different ways

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:09.694
that you can store content.

00:03:09.694 --> 00:03:13.241
If you care really deeply
about the original bytes--

00:03:13.241 --> 00:03:15.490
you want to have the last
bytes down to the very, very

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:17.230
last ones and you
want to make sure

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:21.720
that you can backup raw files
that are 30 megapixels or 4K

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.480
video, then we have our
traditional plans where you can

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:27.080
pay $10 a month for a terabyte.

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:29.330
It's still some of the
cheapest storage on the planet.

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:31.660
You get 15 gigabytes for
free across all your Google

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:33.376
services, and that continues.

00:03:33.376 --> 00:03:36.000
But as we were talking to people
and we realized the challenges

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.380
in this taking back control
of your digital lives,

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:40.700
is we take so many
photos and videos.

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:44.264
And most mobile devices
are less than 16 megapixels

00:03:44.264 --> 00:03:45.680
in terms of the
cameras they take.

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:48.259
Almost all the videos people
are producing are 1080p.

00:03:48.259 --> 00:03:50.800
And we thought, what if we could
take these photos and videos

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:52.560
that these people
are creating and let

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:53.650
them have peace of mind?

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:56.260
We can back them up
unlimited for free.

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.340
And so that's why we
created this ability now

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:01.240
to back up a lifetime of
memories unlimited for free--

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:05.290
under 16 megapixels for
photos, 1080p for HD videos.

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:08.540
And then we use compression
to maintain a near identical

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:09.400
visual quality.

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.030
LAURENCE MORONEY: But you showed
that picture of the penguins,

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.400
right?

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:12.750
And that was a
compressed picture.

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:13.100
ANIL SABHARWA: Yeah.

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:14.720
LAURENCE MORONEY: And there was
still just beautiful fidelity

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:15.010
in it, right?

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:16.093
ANIL SABHARWA: Absolutely.

00:04:16.093 --> 00:04:17.740
And we have some
examples where we go

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:21.310
and we zoom in at like four
levels of detail and really

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:22.980
in there to the
exact same levels--

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:24.620
and we really try
to make it such

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:26.380
that it's indiscernible
to the human eye,

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:29.010
because our goal-- and
that's why we figure out

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:30.760
the right things based
on the right photos

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:32.926
and we do different techniques,
is because we really

00:04:32.926 --> 00:04:35.610
want this to-- you want
comfort that if this

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:38.250
is the only copy of
that photo you have,

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:41.340
we want you to feel incredibly
comfortable and with peace

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:43.690
of mind that you can always
have access to that photo

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:45.750
and it's a good enough
high quality photo.

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:46.590
You can print it.

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:47.530
You can share it.

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:49.150
And it's just like the
memory that you remember

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:50.030
and just like the
photo you took.

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:50.515
LAURENCE MORONEY: Yeah.

00:04:50.515 --> 00:04:52.430
Now my daughter is in
love with penguins.

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:53.830
She absolutely loves penguins.

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:55.240
And when I was looking
at that picture,

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:57.050
I was thinking you were going to
have to send her that picture.

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:59.710
But she's one of these
people-- she's a teenager.

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:02.174
And lots of teenagers, they'll
take out their cell phone

00:05:02.174 --> 00:05:04.340
and they'll take picture,
picture, picture, picture,

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:05.000
picture, picture, right?

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:05.440
ANIL SABHARWA: Absolutely.

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:07.606
LAURENCE MORONEY: She'll
take 10 selfies of herself,

00:05:07.606 --> 00:05:09.480
and then she'll pick
the right selfie.

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:11.100
And then she doesn't
like the others.

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:14.701
Are we doing anything for
that overwhelming amount

00:05:14.701 --> 00:05:15.200
of pictures?

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:15.460
ANIL SABHARWA: Yeah.

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:18.040
I mean, we have just scratched
the surface of all the things

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:19.720
we need to do with Photos.

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:22.025
We're pretty excited about
these three key ideas.

00:05:22.025 --> 00:05:23.400
We think there's
more that we can

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:26.824
do to help you easily and safely
back up your life of memories.

00:05:26.824 --> 00:05:28.990
We think we want to make
sure it's even easier to be

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:30.414
able to find and organize.

00:05:30.414 --> 00:05:32.580
What you're describing is
very much in that category

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:36.840
about, make it easy for me to
hold on to just one of the 10.

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:39.447
And how about when I
share with my wife,

00:05:39.447 --> 00:05:41.280
make it really easy for
us to be able to put

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:42.830
those photos in a single place.

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:45.180
There's a lot of really
great opportunities here.

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:46.550
And so we're just getting
started in Photos.

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:47.210
We've got a lot to do.

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:48.085
LAURENCE MORONEY: Oh.

00:05:48.085 --> 00:05:50.020
An I mean, you've done so much.

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:52.162
One thing really piqued
my curiosity this morning.

00:05:52.162 --> 00:05:53.620
So you were showing
this thing that

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:55.530
had faces of your relatives.

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:58.020
And you picked your
niece, I believe it was.

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:01.680
And then it showed pictures of
her all the way down to a baby.

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:05.060
But how did it understand that
the baby is the same person,

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:06.610
because the face is
different, right?

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:06.721
ANIL SABHARWA: Yeah.

00:06:06.721 --> 00:06:09.700
So we auto-organize your
library by the people, places,

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:10.750
and things that matter.

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:13.260
So in my particular
case, it was very much

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:15.960
my wife, my two kids,
the mother-in-law,

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:18.010
the father-in-law, the
brothers and sisters,

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:19.230
et cetera, friends.

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:22.520
And in the case of the
niece, what we do is we

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:27.340
group faces that are similar
typically within a few years

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:28.109
of an age group.

00:06:28.109 --> 00:06:30.150
So for example, in her
case, we would have likely

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:32.840
done something from when she
was baby to being very young

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:36.461
and then something in her
middle toddler age, eight, nine

00:06:36.461 --> 00:06:36.960
years old.

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:39.560
And then now when, you know,
she's 10 to 15 years old.

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:41.660
And what we do is we get
high levels of confidence

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:42.990
on those groupings.

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:45.910
But then what we can do is based
on some really great, amazing

00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:49.580
computer vision is we can
calculate feature and distance

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:53.100
vectors around how
people naturally age.

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:55.644
And we can start looking
at these three groups

00:06:55.644 --> 00:06:57.060
and we can look
at the progression

00:06:57.060 --> 00:06:57.890
that someone has had.

00:06:57.890 --> 00:07:00.348
And we can say, you know what,
the similarities here-- when

00:07:00.348 --> 00:07:02.290
you apply the way
people start to age--

00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:04.050
actually make these things look
like they're really, really

00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:04.410
close.

00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:06.840
And we can bring these three
neighboring clusters together

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:11.200
in a single one and say, hey,
this is actually the same face.

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:14.180
And because we're doing this
100% private for your eyes

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:16.860
only, it's also really easy
for you to go in and say, hey,

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:18.860
you know what Google
Photos, you made a mistake.

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:21.457
These four people,
that's a different baby.

00:07:21.457 --> 00:07:23.165
And so we try to do
the best that we can,

00:07:23.165 --> 00:07:24.300
but we acknowledge
that every now

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:25.590
and then we're not
going to do it right.

00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:27.840
But we make it really easy
for you to tell us and then

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:30.110
still curate those
results in the right way.

00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:31.270
LAURENCE MORONEY: We're
running low on time,

00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:32.960
but there's one last
question I've got to ask.

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:34.700
And that was the
mountain biking thing,

00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:36.670
the videos that you showed.

00:07:36.670 --> 00:07:38.629
That was hours of videos, right?

00:07:38.629 --> 00:07:40.670
But how was it able to
take those hours of videos

00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:42.547
and turn them into that
one exciting moment,

00:07:42.547 --> 00:07:43.880
including you taking the tumble?

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:45.092
ANIL SABHARWA: Yeah.

00:07:45.092 --> 00:07:46.800
I wish it left that
part out, by the way.

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:47.070
LAURENCE MORONEY: No, I love it.

00:07:47.070 --> 00:07:48.278
We're going to to keep it in.

00:07:48.278 --> 00:07:51.110
ANIL SABHARWA: So what we do
with our movies is when people

00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:53.940
upload lots of videos, we find
that no one really consumes

00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:56.430
them, because you typically
get a great three to four

00:07:56.430 --> 00:07:59.060
second moment, but you often
capture minutes of video.

00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:02.364
In that example, I captured
multiple hours of GoPro footage

00:08:02.364 --> 00:08:03.530
when you're mountain biking.

00:08:03.530 --> 00:08:05.140
And you upload it
because you're like,

00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:06.330
oh, maybe there's
a nugget in here,

00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:08.300
but honestly I never
would have got back to it.

00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:10.530
And so what Google
Photos did for me is it

00:08:10.530 --> 00:08:11.990
analyzed that content.

00:08:11.990 --> 00:08:13.970
It looked for what
the best shots

00:08:13.970 --> 00:08:16.820
are based on the
composition, the lighting.

00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:18.320
It looked for faces.

00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:19.490
It looked for motion.

00:08:19.490 --> 00:08:21.120
And it gave me particular clips.

00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:23.370
And it was able to stitch
that together automatically.

00:08:23.370 --> 00:08:24.370
Now it's a starting point.

00:08:24.370 --> 00:08:25.250
I can go in and edit it.

00:08:25.250 --> 00:08:27.140
I can say, you know what, I
don't want these three clips,

00:08:27.140 --> 00:08:29.262
I want to add these, or I
want to change the theme

00:08:29.262 --> 00:08:29.845
or soundtrack.

00:08:29.845 --> 00:08:31.220
It gives me some options.

00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:32.190
But it's a great starting point.

00:08:32.190 --> 00:08:33.470
We used some really
great technology

00:08:33.470 --> 00:08:34.179
to put that together.

00:08:34.179 --> 00:08:35.669
LAURENCE MORONEY: And it just
created a nice little story

00:08:35.669 --> 00:08:36.090
for you, right?

00:08:36.090 --> 00:08:36.720
ANIL SABHARWA: Exactly.

00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:37.730
And that's a moment.

00:08:37.730 --> 00:08:39.260
And then I would
share that, right?

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:41.520
I was never going to share four
hours of GoPro footage of me

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:42.240
mountain biking [INAUDIBLE].

00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:44.406
LAURENCE MORONEY: [INAUDIBLE]
some people would love

00:08:44.406 --> 00:08:45.729
to watch it, but [INAUDIBLE].

00:08:45.729 --> 00:08:47.020
ANIL SABHARWA: You're too kind.

00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:48.061
I don't think they would.

00:08:48.061 --> 00:08:48.885
But, yes.

00:08:48.885 --> 00:08:50.760
LAURENCE MORONEY: So
thank you so much, Anil.

00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:51.760
That was fabulous.

00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:54.820
And the new Google Photos,
it's available to download now

00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:55.980
for iOS and Android.

00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:56.930
So go check it out.

00:08:56.930 --> 00:08:58.660
ANIL SABHARWA: And it's also
on the web-- photos.google.com.

00:08:58.660 --> 00:08:59.720
LAURENCE MORONEY:
Also on the web.

00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:01.220
So I can actually
take my old photos

00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:02.140
and upload them on the web?

00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:03.223
ANIL SABHARWA: Absolutely.

00:09:03.223 --> 00:09:03.760
Right now.

00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:04.760
LAURENCE MORONEY: Sweet.

00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:05.640
photos.google.com.

00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:07.270
And it's available
for Android and iOS.

00:09:07.270 --> 00:09:08.020
Thank you so much.

00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:08.310
ANIL SABHARWA: Thanks, Laurence.

00:09:08.310 --> 00:09:08.740
I appreciate the time.

00:09:08.740 --> 00:09:09.906
LAURENCE MORONEY: Thank you.

00:09:09.906 --> 00:09:10.830
Cheers.
