00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:03.590
&gt;&gt; Manuel Roig-Franzia: My
name is Manuel Roig-Franzia.

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:06.260
I'm a reporter at
the Washington Post.

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:09.290
But much more importantly today,

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:14.850
I am the designated
introducer of all Lawrence's.

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:17.610
I was on this stage just
a couple hours earlier

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:21.940
to introduce Lawrence
Jacksons, Author, Professor

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:24.070
and now it will be my privilege

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:27.520
to introduce you
to Lawrence Wright.

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:30.260
Before we get started,
we just wanted

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:34.410
to thank the co-chairmen David
Rubenstein for his support

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.290
and if anyone is interested

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.990
in supporting the festival I
would direct you to your program

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:43.760
where you can take
a look at that.

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:48.860
Also, Lawrence has agreed,
this Lawrence has agreed

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:51.720
to answer some questions
afterwards

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:55.960
about this book "God
Saved Texas".

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:00.140
So why have I read Lawrence
Wright overall these years

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:02.980
in the New Yorker
and in his books?

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:08.970
I would say it's because he has
this special gift among American

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.030
writers to provide
historical context

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:18.440
about complicated topics, to
placing perspective things

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:23.390
that are very urgent and
relevant right now in our lives

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:28.030
as he did in 2006 with his
Pulitzer Prize winning book

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:30.810
"The Learning Tower",
about the attacks

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.310
by Al-Qaeda on September 11.

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:43.090
And in this book he is turning
his eye for detail to the place

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:45.830
where he lives, the
state of Texas,

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:49.010
which I would argue
is also urgent

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:51.230
and relevant at this moment.

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:58.260
And he does so with his
quintessential ability

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.940
to spot important detail.

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:10.430
And he does so with an
unstinting, unremitting desire

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:19.650
to get at the soul of this place
and it's not all great, right?

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:23.240
There's - it's a place
with its triumphs

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:26.180
and it's also a place
with its vanities.

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:31.400
And he talks about it with
well I would say empathy.

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.170
Just wanted to, before I
had the podium over to him,

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:37.600
share with you one
little passage.

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:43.790
"Houston is the only major city
in America without zoning laws.

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:47.940
You can build pretty
much anything you want,

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:53.090
anywhere you want except in
designated historical districts.

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:55.230
You'll see some odd sites

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:00.980
such as a two story family home
adjacent to a roller coaster,

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:07.280
or an erotic nightclub next to
a shopping gallery, or maybe

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:14.290
and this was my favorite,
a house made of beer cans."

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:16.510
With that, I give
you Lawrence Wright.

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:23.740
[ Applause ]

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:25.290
&gt;&gt; Lawrence Wright: Well
thank you very much.

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:29.510
It's a delight and
an honor to be back

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:32.170
at the National Book
Festival, which was founded

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:33.680
by Laura Bush by the way.

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.830
And you know she started the
Texas Book Festival first.

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:42.600
And she was a librarian from
Midland Texas and her influence

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:44.990
over books and authors

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:48.810
and libraries is
really a great legacy.

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:53.730
First of all, I better ask if
anybody here speaks Norwegian.

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:58.010
There's a maybe here, all right.

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:03.240
Well I'm going to try this.

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:04.540
[Norwegian] I'm told

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:09.140
by a Norwegian friend it
means it was totally bonkers.

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:16.380
If you are a Texas you've
quickly learned that everybody

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:20.500
in the world has an
opinion about Texas.

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:24.710
And, good or bad, but
everybody has an opinion.

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:26.960
When I was - I think
it was partly

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:31.280
because there's this huge myth
that surrounds this state,

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:35.300
almost unique among
our American states.

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:37.500
But as a young man
I taught English

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:39.540
at the American University
in Cairo.

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:42.870
And I used to go horseback
riding out at the pyramids.

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:47.600
And I grew up in Dallas, I'm
a city boy, I'm not a cowboy.

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:51.810
But the owner of the stable
found out that I was from Texas

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:54.800
and he began calling me Texas.

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:57.830
And then one day I
went out and he said,

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:02.400
"Oh Texas we've got
a horse for you."

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:06.160
Three guys bring this
rearing stallion out,

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:10.870
his nostrils are flaring, his
hooves are ripping the air.

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:12.640
It was terrifying.

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:16.900
But because I was Texas I
had to get on this beast

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:19.400
and he took me half way to
Libya before I could get him

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:21.240
to turn around.

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:24.790
But I felt I was literally
astride the Texas myth.

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:29.790
You know there's a difference

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:32.550
between the way Texas
see themselves

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:34.750
and the way other people see us.

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:39.790
For the most part Texans think
of us as confident, hardworking

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:43.980
and relatively non-neurotic.

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:48.920
People outside of Texas tend
to have a different view.

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:52.770
They see us as mindless
individualists,

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:57.510
people who hate government,
braggarts and exaggerators,

00:05:57.510 --> 00:06:01.970
people who are careless with
the truth and with money

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:06.640
and with our personal lives,
we're insecure but obsessed

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:09.800
with money and prestige.

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:12.840
It seems a little ironic
to me that the person

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:16.180
who perhaps most exemplifies
these values is a certain

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:18.780
narcissistic Manhattan
billionaire now living

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:21.190
in the White House.

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:24.670
I've often wondered what
it would be like for Texans

00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:28.070
if Donald Trump was from Ft.

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:31.110
Worth rather than from Queens.

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:33.590
The way that Texas was taken

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:38.790
down during the Johnson
presidency and the Bush's.

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:41.390
I wonder if New York will
ever be held to account

00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:45.950
in the same way for the
values that he represents.

00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:48.810
Now another thing
about the views

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:52.540
that people have towards Texas
is that they tend to break

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:55.450
down along political lines.

00:06:55.450 --> 00:06:57.510
Liberals look at
Texas with dread.

00:06:57.510 --> 00:07:03.190
As far as they're concerned it's
the most heartless of societies.

00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:08.770
It is the kind of ground zero

00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:12.610
of Daddy Warbuck's
predatory capitalism.

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:15.310
And conservatives view Texas

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:18.640
as the promised land
of entrepreneurs.

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:21.370
Minimal government, low taxes.

00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:28.440
And of course both of these
things are absolutely true.

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:32.730
Now one thing everybody would
agree on Texas is growing

00:07:32.730 --> 00:07:35.290
at a break neck speed,
twice the rate

00:07:35.290 --> 00:07:37.680
of the United States as a whole.

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:41.600
People thing of Texas as
being kind of a rural state,

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:46.960
but three of the top 10 largest
cities in America are in Texas.

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:51.880
And the 11th largest city in
America is Austin, where I live.

00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:57.720
Far cry from the little
college town I moved to in 1980.

00:07:57.720 --> 00:08:04.220
Houston and Dallas are projected
to each have 10 million people

00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:08.430
by the year 2030, that's
just 12 years from now.

00:08:08.430 --> 00:08:10.630
Just to put this into
perspective, New York City,

00:08:10.630 --> 00:08:14.270
the largest city in
American has eight million.

00:08:14.270 --> 00:08:19.280
There are 29 million
Texans right now.

00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:22.580
That number is projected
to almost double by 2050

00:08:22.580 --> 00:08:26.460
at which time Texas will be
almost as large as New York

00:08:26.460 --> 00:08:29.020
and California combined.

00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:35.660
The next census Texas will add
four congressional districts

00:08:35.660 --> 00:08:39.810
giving it a total of
42 electoral votes.

00:08:39.810 --> 00:08:43.970
Now California, the largest
state has 55 electoral votes,

00:08:43.970 --> 00:08:47.180
but that number hasn't
increased since 2003.

00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:50.230
And it won't in the
next redistricting.

00:08:50.230 --> 00:08:52.910
New York has been
losing population,

00:08:52.910 --> 00:08:56.610
congressional delegates and
electoral votes for decades.

00:08:56.610 --> 00:09:02.380
So like it or not
the future is Texas.

00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:07.450
Now how did Texas get
to be so important?

00:09:07.450 --> 00:09:13.630
I can answer that question
with a single word, oil.

00:09:13.630 --> 00:09:18.310
Texas would not be where it is
today or anywhere close to it

00:09:18.310 --> 00:09:21.400
if it weren't for three wells
that I'm going to tell you

00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:24.530
about that made Texas
what it is.

00:09:24.530 --> 00:09:30.470
And start back in the
turn of the 20th century,

00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:35.590
there was a little hill
outside Beaumont in East Texas.

00:09:35.590 --> 00:09:38.600
It was called Sour Spring Mound.

00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:41.840
It was gassy, school
boys used to set it

00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:44.650
on fire every once in a while.

00:09:44.650 --> 00:09:49.460
And there was a con
man, well as an aside;

00:09:49.460 --> 00:09:53.020
con men play an unusually large
part in the history of Texas.

00:09:53.020 --> 00:09:56.910
But this particular con man
was named Patil O'Higgins.

00:09:56.910 --> 00:10:00.830
He had lost an arm in a
gunfight with a deputy sheriff

00:10:00.830 --> 00:10:03.720
and he decided that
he could find oil

00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:07.390
in Sour Spring Mound Hill.

00:10:07.390 --> 00:10:15.460
And he predicted that he would
discover oil at 1,000 feet down.

00:10:15.460 --> 00:10:17.720
Totally made up figure.

00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:20.790
The one thing that he
did that was an act

00:10:20.790 --> 00:10:24.750
of genius was he hired a
Croatian American mining

00:10:24.750 --> 00:10:28.300
engineer named Captain
Anthony Lucas.

00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:30.800
And you have to understand,

00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:33.420
back in that day wells
weren't really drilled,

00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:36.150
they were pounded
into the earth.

00:10:36.150 --> 00:10:40.180
Captain Lucas adopted a new
innovation called a rotary bit,

00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:43.380
so that as a first time wells
were actually drilled rather

00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:44.780
than pounded.

00:10:44.780 --> 00:10:49.630
And the other thing is
underneath Sour Spring Mound was

00:10:49.630 --> 00:10:50.930
quick sand.

00:10:50.930 --> 00:10:54.150
So whenever they pulled the pipe
out the hole would collapse.

00:10:54.150 --> 00:10:57.470
So Captain Lucas started
pouring mud into the hole

00:10:57.470 --> 00:10:59.130
and it formed a kind of concrete

00:10:59.130 --> 00:11:02.000
that preserved the
integrity of the hole.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.390
That's beginning -
that was the beginning

00:11:04.390 --> 00:11:07.830
of the modern drilling industry.

00:11:07.830 --> 00:11:11.420
Now Patil O'Higgins
was hoping for a well

00:11:11.420 --> 00:11:15.060
that would produce
50 barrels a day.

00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:23.150
On January 10, 1901 at
1,020 feet, 20 feet away

00:11:23.150 --> 00:11:28.340
from his estimate the
well suddenly vomited mud

00:11:28.340 --> 00:11:32.760
and then six tons of
drilling pipe flew

00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:36.130
up into the sky over
the derrick.

00:11:36.130 --> 00:11:38.280
It was terrifying.

00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:42.890
The roughnecks all scattered and
they waited for things to quiet

00:11:42.890 --> 00:11:46.880
down and then began to
creep back to where the -

00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:51.040
to well to try to clean things
up and suddenly there was a roar

00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:53.220
from somewhere deep,
deep in the earth

00:11:53.220 --> 00:11:56.900
from another geological age.

00:11:56.900 --> 00:12:01.390
And oil spewed up 150
feet into the air,

00:12:01.390 --> 00:12:02.690
it was the first gusher.

00:12:02.690 --> 00:12:05.570
Nobody had ever seen one before.

00:12:05.570 --> 00:12:10.460
For the next nine days
until this well was capped,

00:12:10.460 --> 00:12:13.720
the well came to be
known as spindle top,

00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:20.280
spewed out 100,000 barrels a
day, more than all the wells

00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:25.490
in America combined
at that time.

00:12:25.490 --> 00:12:29.110
You'd have to take yourself
back to Texas at that moment.

00:12:29.110 --> 00:12:32.610
It was an entirely rural state.

00:12:32.610 --> 00:12:36.810
The money that was
there was from cotton

00:12:36.810 --> 00:12:40.490
and timber and cattle.

00:12:40.490 --> 00:12:43.730
Spindle top changed all that.

00:12:43.730 --> 00:12:48.860
The real wealth poured
into the state.

00:12:48.860 --> 00:12:53.480
Houston became the - is anybody
here from Houston by the way?

00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:58.100
Well at the very beginning of
this Houston adopted the motto,

00:12:58.100 --> 00:13:00.740
Houston gateway to Beaumont.

00:13:00.740 --> 00:13:05.960
There was already a little
bit too much self-city pride

00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:10.830
for that to endure so they
captured the oil business

00:13:10.830 --> 00:13:14.080
and took it to Houston and then
made Houston the energy capital

00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:15.420
of the world.

00:13:15.420 --> 00:13:19.060
And Texas as we know
it was born.

00:13:19.060 --> 00:13:25.830
Now also born was a pattern
with the boom comes a bust.

00:13:25.830 --> 00:13:28.150
Prices after Spindle
Top crashed.

00:13:28.150 --> 00:13:30.860
In many places oil was
cheaper than water.

00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:33.660
Now that was the first well.

00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:35.720
That was the beginning of Texas.

00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:40.410
There was another well that
I'll tell you about that was

00:13:40.410 --> 00:13:44.340
in East Texas on the
Daisy Bradford lease,

00:13:44.340 --> 00:13:47.110
Daisy Bradford being the
widow who owned the land.

00:13:47.110 --> 00:13:53.440
There was a con man,
Columbus Marion Joyner,

00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:55.280
fondly known as Dad.

00:13:55.280 --> 00:13:58.070
And he had been drilling
on the Daisy Bradford lease

00:13:58.070 --> 00:14:00.750
for several years,
two dry wells.

00:14:00.750 --> 00:14:02.050
He was broke.

00:14:02.050 --> 00:14:03.740
And so what did he do?

00:14:03.740 --> 00:14:06.940
He got some phony
geological reports.

00:14:06.940 --> 00:14:10.790
And he went around showing these
geological reports that said

00:14:10.790 --> 00:14:12.090
that they were going to tap

00:14:12.090 --> 00:14:16.990
into the greatest oil field
ever known at 3,500 feet.

00:14:16.990 --> 00:14:20.210
Once again a total
lie that turned

00:14:20.210 --> 00:14:22.790
out to be absolutely true.

00:14:22.790 --> 00:14:33.630
On October 3, 1930 there was
a gurgling at 3,456 feet.

00:14:33.630 --> 00:14:35.070
Thousands of people gathered.

00:14:35.070 --> 00:14:37.350
They'd heard about Spindle Top.

00:14:37.350 --> 00:14:42.850
Farmers in bib overalls
and ladies in dresses sewn

00:14:42.850 --> 00:14:48.120
out of Sears Catalog
patterns and they were waiting

00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:51.090
for what would happen next.

00:14:51.090 --> 00:14:54.590
No doubt they were thinking
that soon they'd be rich.

00:14:54.590 --> 00:14:59.100
Soon they'd be walking down
the Champs-Elysees buying furs

00:14:59.100 --> 00:15:01.880
and jewelry and considering
their investments.

00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:07.310
The thing is this actually
happened for many of them.

00:15:07.310 --> 00:15:09.990
The gusher comes,
children - the black rain

00:15:09.990 --> 00:15:11.760
as it began to be called.

00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:16.160
Children danced in the rain
and painted their faces.

00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:18.960
Nine months later
there were 1,000 wells

00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:23.010
in East Texas producing
half the total US demand.

00:15:23.010 --> 00:15:26.890
In one leased Texas town,
Kilgore there were 44 wells

00:15:26.890 --> 00:15:28.820
in a since city block.

00:15:28.820 --> 00:15:32.230
You could walk through downtown
Kilgore from derrick to derrick

00:15:32.230 --> 00:15:34.900
without your feet ever
touching the ground.

00:15:34.900 --> 00:15:40.160
And of course prices went
from $1.10 a barrel to $.13

00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:43.380
and the governor had to
shut down well production.

00:15:43.380 --> 00:15:46.170
Now the last well I'm
going to talk to you

00:15:46.170 --> 00:15:50.600
about is more pertinent
to your life right now.

00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:56.710
By the 1909's people were
talking about peak oil.

00:15:56.710 --> 00:16:01.050
Peak oil is that
moment when half

00:16:01.050 --> 00:16:06.110
of all the recoverable petroleum
resources have been discovered

00:16:06.110 --> 00:16:07.410
and exploited.

00:16:07.410 --> 00:16:10.810
And from then on it's just
a long downhill slide.

00:16:10.810 --> 00:16:15.420
And that's where people
thought we were in the 90's.

00:16:15.420 --> 00:16:20.370
And into this period there's
a man named George Mitchell,

00:16:20.370 --> 00:16:23.780
probably the greatest
wildcat Texas has ever known.

00:16:23.780 --> 00:16:26.420
He was the son of
Greek immigrants.

00:16:26.420 --> 00:16:30.990
His father had been a shepherd
in Greece and moved to Galveston

00:16:30.990 --> 00:16:33.560
and opened up a shoe
shine stand.

00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:38.200
And George Mitchell was a
prodigy, acting on a tip

00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:41.350
from a bookie in Chicago.

00:16:41.350 --> 00:16:46.000
He leased some land
North of Dallas.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:52.590
And he believed in by 1980

00:16:52.590 --> 00:16:56.090
that American only
had 35 years remaining

00:16:56.090 --> 00:17:00.060
of recoverable conventional
sources of petroleum.

00:17:00.060 --> 00:17:06.320
And the only alternative
that he could see was coal.

00:17:06.320 --> 00:17:10.890
Now Mitchell was
an environmentalist

00:17:10.890 --> 00:17:14.350
and very progressive
conservationist.

00:17:14.350 --> 00:17:18.630
There's a - you will
know about the woodlands,

00:17:18.630 --> 00:17:21.890
they built a planned
community outside of Houston

00:17:21.890 --> 00:17:23.650
that exemplified these qualities

00:17:23.650 --> 00:17:28.640
of environmental
preservation and conservation.

00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:31.300
And he looked down the road
of what was going to happen

00:17:31.300 --> 00:17:34.410
to America and the world
if we turned to coal.

00:17:34.410 --> 00:17:36.870
Either we would have
to sacrifice energy

00:17:36.870 --> 00:17:40.310
of our civilization or we
would destroy our planet

00:17:40.310 --> 00:17:41.900
with the pollution.

00:17:41.900 --> 00:17:43.720
In his opinion the only thing

00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:47.050
that could rescue the
planet was natural gas.

00:17:47.050 --> 00:17:48.750
It burns far cleaner than coal.

00:17:48.750 --> 00:17:54.730
And as it happened, he had
300,000 acres under lease

00:17:54.730 --> 00:18:00.030
and he also had a contract
with the city of Chicago

00:18:00.030 --> 00:18:03.660
to provide 10% of that
cities natural gas needs.

00:18:03.660 --> 00:18:06.650
It was a terrific
deal when he signed it

00:18:06.650 --> 00:18:09.920
but his resources were
continually diminishing,

00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:12.590
so he was facing bankruptcy.

00:18:14.330 --> 00:18:18.590
Now a mile and a half
below this area that he had

00:18:18.590 --> 00:18:20.280
under lease 70 miles north

00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:24.590
of Dallas is a geological
stratum called the

00:18:24.590 --> 00:18:26.550
Barnett Shale.

00:18:26.550 --> 00:18:30.990
Its 5,000 square
miles in dimension.

00:18:30.990 --> 00:18:34.360
It covers 17 counties,
most of them in Texas.

00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:39.640
And it was estimated and known
to have the largest gas reserves

00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:43.020
of any on shore field in
the entire United States.

00:18:43.020 --> 00:18:45.010
So everybody knew gas was there.

00:18:45.010 --> 00:18:46.340
There was a problem.

00:18:46.340 --> 00:18:49.490
Those other wells that I told
you about were in limestone

00:18:49.490 --> 00:18:54.170
or sandstone and petroleum
molecules moved fairly easily

00:18:54.170 --> 00:18:56.020
through that kind
of porous rock.

00:18:56.020 --> 00:18:58.370
But shale is tight rock.

00:18:58.370 --> 00:19:02.900
In other words there's no place
to move, it's like a prison;

00:19:02.900 --> 00:19:06.760
so how do you liberate
those gas and oil molecules?

00:19:06.760 --> 00:19:08.830
Well dynamite.

00:19:08.830 --> 00:19:10.490
That was - they tried that.

00:19:10.490 --> 00:19:13.680
Bazookas, machine guns.

00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:21.620
In 1967 the atomic energy
commission exploded a 29 kiloton

00:19:21.620 --> 00:19:25.140
nuclear bomb in Northern
New Mexico 3,000 feet below

00:19:25.140 --> 00:19:26.440
the surface.

00:19:26.440 --> 00:19:29.190
And that was the first of
30 such nuclear devices

00:19:29.190 --> 00:19:31.750
that were used to try
to free up the gas

00:19:31.750 --> 00:19:33.840
that people knew was down there.

00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:37.870
And actually did work, but
the gas was radioactive,

00:19:37.870 --> 00:19:42.000
which as you know
surprise, right?

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:48.630
So a technique had been
developed using fluid,

00:19:48.630 --> 00:19:54.270
hydraulic fluid to
more precisely shatter,

00:19:54.270 --> 00:19:56.860
create little fractures
in this rock.

00:19:56.860 --> 00:20:00.840
But it was just too
expensive to work in shale.

00:20:00.840 --> 00:20:05.090
Now Mitchell had the problem, he
had the contract with Chicago.

00:20:05.090 --> 00:20:10.710
He had this quest to save
civilization and he had a lot

00:20:10.710 --> 00:20:12.370
of gas that he had to get.

00:20:12.370 --> 00:20:20.020
So in 1981 he drilled his first
hydraulically fracked well.

00:20:20.020 --> 00:20:24.190
Fracking comes from
fracturing in the Barnett shale.

00:20:24.190 --> 00:20:28.220
It was CW Shay #1
and it lost money.

00:20:28.220 --> 00:20:33.260
And so did the next 300 wells
that he fracked at the cost

00:20:33.260 --> 00:20:35.890
of 250 million dollars
to his company.

00:20:35.890 --> 00:20:41.600
It was in 1998, 17
years after CW Slay #1

00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:45.510
that the SH Griffin
#4 was drilled.

00:20:45.510 --> 00:20:47.060
And through refinements

00:20:47.060 --> 00:20:52.690
in the hydraulic fluid it
was finally profitable.

00:20:52.690 --> 00:20:58.530
And that's the day that
fracking revolution began.

00:20:58.530 --> 00:21:01.070
It was the third
time in Texas history

00:21:01.070 --> 00:21:04.520
that the state has
transformed the energy business.

00:21:04.520 --> 00:21:09.470
Bear in mind the US industry
was in a long decline.

00:21:09.470 --> 00:21:13.780
From 1970 which was the
peak of our oil production

00:21:13.780 --> 00:21:15.850
when 10 million barrels
a day were produced

00:21:15.850 --> 00:21:19.580
in the United States, the
production had been declining

00:21:19.580 --> 00:21:22.210
and declining and that
period of time many

00:21:22.210 --> 00:21:25.490
of you will remember was
marked by oil embargos,

00:21:25.490 --> 00:21:29.790
wars in the Middle East,
gas lines and the fear

00:21:29.790 --> 00:21:33.520
that the world economy was
being held hostage by regimes

00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:37.210
that were often intensely
anti-Western, anti American.

00:21:37.210 --> 00:21:43.000
So US production
touched bottom in 2008

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.710
when only 5 million
barrels of oil were produced

00:21:45.710 --> 00:21:49.530
in that year, barrels per day.

00:21:49.530 --> 00:21:54.340
And oil prices hit a
record of $145.00a barrel.

00:21:54.340 --> 00:21:57.970
But the fracking revolution
was already under way.

00:21:57.970 --> 00:22:05.200
By 2010 14,000 wells in the
Barnett Shale alone US oil

00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:08.240
and gas production
doubled in five years.

00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:09.770
It's the most remarkable
thing if you look

00:22:09.770 --> 00:22:14.250
at a chart what you see is
this long - just up like that.

00:22:14.250 --> 00:22:18.190
Now we're producing more oil
and gas than we ever have

00:22:18.190 --> 00:22:23.150
and we're actually exporting
- it's higher than ever.

00:22:23.150 --> 00:22:25.300
Now of course we all know

00:22:25.300 --> 00:22:28.390
as George Mitchell did
not understand at the time

00:22:28.390 --> 00:22:32.340
that fracking comes along with
its own environmental cost.

00:22:32.340 --> 00:22:35.970
And a lot of it has to do with
the methane gases that escape

00:22:35.970 --> 00:22:38.350
from poorly controlled wells.

00:22:38.350 --> 00:22:41.150
Mitchell warned that
this industry needs

00:22:41.150 --> 00:22:44.830
to be intensely regulated,
but it is not.

00:22:44.830 --> 00:22:48.720
Comes the crash of course
in January of 16 oil was

00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:53.800
under $30 a barrel and Houston
alone lost 70,000 energy

00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:55.230
related jobs.

00:22:55.230 --> 00:22:57.010
But something didn't happen.

00:22:57.010 --> 00:22:59.670
The Texas economy did not crash

00:22:59.670 --> 00:23:03.120
as it had always done
whenever oil prices had crashed

00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:04.420
in the past.

00:23:04.420 --> 00:23:07.040
It had become a much more
diverse state economically

00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:11.450
which accounts for this amazing
growth that we're seeing now.

00:23:11.450 --> 00:23:15.820
Now Texas is often
compared with California.

00:23:15.820 --> 00:23:18.370
In fact, it works both ways.

00:23:18.370 --> 00:23:22.360
You - it's fascinating to
live in a country that has two

00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:25.200
such dynamic but
opposing models.

00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:29.350
Our governor Greg Abbot
is constantly warning

00:23:29.350 --> 00:23:32.600
about the dangers
of Californization.

00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:39.310
He's - in Austin where I live,
he sees it as a kind of spore

00:23:39.310 --> 00:23:42.980
on the fungus of California
that's destroying the Texas way

00:23:42.980 --> 00:23:44.280
of life.

00:23:44.280 --> 00:23:47.870
And the examples he cites
are plastic bag bands

00:23:47.870 --> 00:23:52.650
and burdensome tree ordinances
and lately its plastic straws

00:23:52.650 --> 00:23:54.180
that have been banned.

00:23:54.180 --> 00:23:57.800
These are all no doubt a
serious threat to our democracy.

00:23:57.800 --> 00:24:00.430
But this whole idea

00:24:00.430 --> 00:24:05.730
that California is the
enemy has taken root.

00:24:05.730 --> 00:24:12.260
And I'm in a band and our
drummer has a sticker on his kit

00:24:12.260 --> 00:24:17.250
that says "Stop Californication
of Texas music".

00:24:17.250 --> 00:24:20.120
I have no idea - I don't
know what it means.

00:24:20.120 --> 00:24:25.480
But it's in his mind that
Texas music is under attack.

00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:29.950
The gross domestic product of
Texas is 1.6 trillion dollars.

00:24:29.950 --> 00:24:32.870
If it were a country it'd
be the 10th largest economy

00:24:32.870 --> 00:24:35.160
in the world just
ahead of Canada.

00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:37.800
Now California has
40% more people

00:24:37.800 --> 00:24:41.290
and its GDP is 2.6
trillion dollars

00:24:41.290 --> 00:24:43.860
about the same as
United Kingdom.

00:24:43.860 --> 00:24:47.420
But Texas has been
closing the gap.

00:24:47.420 --> 00:24:52.810
Exports from Texas nearly
outrank those of California

00:24:52.810 --> 00:24:55.310
and New York combined right now,

00:24:55.310 --> 00:24:57.800
and Texas already
outranks California

00:24:57.800 --> 00:25:00.280
in the export of technology.

00:25:00.280 --> 00:25:07.910
From 2000 to 2016 job growth
in Dallas and Houston grew 31%,

00:25:07.910 --> 00:25:10.680
three times the rate
in Los Angeles.

00:25:10.680 --> 00:25:14.450
In Austin that outpost
of liberalism

00:25:14.450 --> 00:25:17.860
at 50% during the
same period of time.

00:25:17.860 --> 00:25:19.160
Take that governor.

00:25:19.160 --> 00:25:26.810
2017 the fourth quarter
growth in Texas grew 5.4%;

00:25:26.810 --> 00:25:29.170
there wasn't a single other
state in the entire country

00:25:29.170 --> 00:25:31.170
that was above four,
except for Idaho.

00:25:31.170 --> 00:25:34.370
There must have been
a run on potatoes,

00:25:34.370 --> 00:25:37.340
but Idaho did very well.

00:25:37.340 --> 00:25:41.430
California grew at 3.2%
during that same time.

00:25:41.430 --> 00:25:43.880
Now these are two
states that are

00:25:43.880 --> 00:25:46.970
so alike and yet so different.

00:25:46.970 --> 00:25:52.130
They're both a majority,
minority prefiguring the country

00:25:52.130 --> 00:25:54.910
that America will someday be.

00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:59.190
They're kind of mirror
images of each other.

00:25:59.190 --> 00:26:04.540
California is an entirely
democratic state, at state level

00:26:04.540 --> 00:26:08.390
and Texas hasn't elected
a democrat to state office

00:26:08.390 --> 00:26:11.500
since 1994, more than 20 years.

00:26:11.500 --> 00:26:13.540
They couldn't have
been more different,

00:26:13.540 --> 00:26:18.110
and yet when I was a young
man, when I was your age,

00:26:18.110 --> 00:26:22.160
Texas was a blue and
California was red.

00:26:22.160 --> 00:26:25.720
Texas produced Lyndon
Johnson and the great society

00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:28.630
and California produced
Ronald Reagan

00:26:28.630 --> 00:26:30.790
and the modern conservative
revolution.

00:26:30.790 --> 00:26:34.520
So these things are
constantly in flux, but the ways

00:26:34.520 --> 00:26:37.260
in which California and Texas -

00:26:37.260 --> 00:26:40.180
kind of like the double
helix or something.

00:26:40.180 --> 00:26:44.400
They revolve around each other
always opposing in a kind

00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:47.140
of dynamic conversation.

00:26:47.140 --> 00:26:50.260
It naturally brings
up the question

00:26:50.260 --> 00:26:53.130
and I've been asked
this a million times.

00:26:53.130 --> 00:26:57.550
You know will Texas turn
blue or even purple?

00:26:57.550 --> 00:27:00.710
And the answer is yes.

00:27:00.710 --> 00:27:06.090
It will. When is
only the question.

00:27:06.090 --> 00:27:12.700
The growth is in the cities.

00:27:12.700 --> 00:27:18.960
The - even the suburbs which
have been so - such strongholds

00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:20.990
for the republic party.

00:27:20.990 --> 00:27:23.630
New immigrants are
coming in with different -

00:27:23.630 --> 00:27:26.320
all this growth brings in
people who aren't a part

00:27:26.320 --> 00:27:28.320
of the Texas political culture.

00:27:28.320 --> 00:27:29.790
And they have their
own histories.

00:27:29.790 --> 00:27:34.440
In fact working the
opposite way was my family.

00:27:34.440 --> 00:27:40.840
We moved to Texas in 1956.

00:27:40.840 --> 00:27:45.900
My dad was a returning war
veteran and like many people

00:27:45.900 --> 00:27:48.080
who had fought under
General Eisenhower,

00:27:48.080 --> 00:27:50.200
he was an Eisenhower Republican.

00:27:50.200 --> 00:27:54.680
And so he moved to -
moved to Abilene and then

00:27:54.680 --> 00:27:58.100
to Dallas because of the jobs.

00:27:58.100 --> 00:28:01.130
People don't move to Texas
because of the scenery,

00:28:01.130 --> 00:28:04.890
but it's a great job producer.

00:28:04.890 --> 00:28:07.940
And it offered my father
as it has offered millions

00:28:07.940 --> 00:28:11.700
of other people a
chance to succeed,

00:28:11.700 --> 00:28:16.330
a chance to become the kind of
person he always wanted to be.

00:28:16.330 --> 00:28:19.650
But he was an Eisenhower
Republican and it was Dallas,

00:28:19.650 --> 00:28:24.490
the city that we moved to that
became the first city in Texas

00:28:24.490 --> 00:28:27.830
to elect a Republican
congressman,

00:28:27.830 --> 00:28:31.820
the first since reconstruction,
after the Civil War.

00:28:31.820 --> 00:28:35.210
So I remember the turn.

00:28:35.210 --> 00:28:42.570
Now Texas is already far
more liberal or progressive

00:28:42.570 --> 00:28:46.890
than our elected representatives
would lead you to believe,

00:28:46.890 --> 00:28:54.330
the demography and the politics
are at odds with each other.

00:28:54.330 --> 00:28:58.410
There was a figure - I mean
the people who really count

00:28:58.410 --> 00:29:01.460
in Texas politics are
the primary voters

00:29:01.460 --> 00:29:03.160
in the Republican Party.

00:29:03.160 --> 00:29:05.740
Up until recently
and it may change,

00:29:05.740 --> 00:29:09.430
but we'll see it's been the
Republican primary voter

00:29:09.430 --> 00:29:15.210
that has determined the
outcome of the election.

00:29:15.210 --> 00:29:20.820
Now Wendy Davis who was the
previous candidate for governor

00:29:20.820 --> 00:29:23.250
against Greg Abbot
who was crushed;

00:29:23.250 --> 00:29:26.370
he beat her by 20 points.

00:29:26.370 --> 00:29:30.050
She made the observation that
Texas is not a red state;

00:29:30.050 --> 00:29:33.110
it's a non-voting blue state.

00:29:33.110 --> 00:29:35.760
And she's absolutely
right about it.

00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:38.850
Texas has always been
at the very bottom

00:29:38.850 --> 00:29:43.480
or near the bottom
in voter turnout.

00:29:43.480 --> 00:29:46.930
Now why is that?

00:29:46.930 --> 00:29:50.120
People often blame the Hispanics
in Texas for not voting

00:29:50.120 --> 00:29:52.680
and it's true that
they tend not to.

00:29:52.680 --> 00:29:54.650
But why would that be true?

00:29:54.650 --> 00:29:58.870
Well in my opinion where
in California they do tend

00:29:58.870 --> 00:30:00.710
to turn out.

00:30:00.710 --> 00:30:04.040
It's because they've never
had a candidate who spoke

00:30:04.040 --> 00:30:07.980
to their needs especially
the disenfranchised Texans

00:30:07.980 --> 00:30:11.910
that have never been that
charismatic figure who spoke

00:30:11.910 --> 00:30:13.620
in a language they understood.

00:30:13.620 --> 00:30:17.800
Now it's going to be an
interesting test this November,

00:30:17.800 --> 00:30:25.840
a very interesting test between
Raphael Cruz who is Hispanic

00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:29.920
but born in Canada,
no Texan can forget.

00:30:29.920 --> 00:30:34.530
Who Anglicized his name to Ted

00:30:34.530 --> 00:30:38.670
and who speaks rather
halting Spanish

00:30:40.360 --> 00:30:46.440
and Robert Francis O'Rourke who
since childhood has been known

00:30:46.440 --> 00:30:52.340
by the Spanish diminutive Beto,
who speaks very fluent Spanish,

00:30:52.340 --> 00:30:57.130
and has been in every single
one of the Texas's 254 counties,

00:30:57.130 --> 00:30:58.920
including all that border area

00:30:58.920 --> 00:31:03.730
where he speaks to
people in Spanish?

00:31:03.730 --> 00:31:09.240
Whether Texas is red or blue or
purple, the decisions we make

00:31:09.240 --> 00:31:12.960
in Texas are going to
determine the future of America.

00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:17.800
Right now, 10% of all school
children in America are Texans.

00:31:17.800 --> 00:31:20.830
But Texas spends $2,500 less

00:31:20.830 --> 00:31:28.210
than the national average per
student; it's 49th out of 50.

00:31:28.210 --> 00:31:32.130
Fortunately not the 50th, it's
a rich state, it's shameful.

00:31:32.130 --> 00:31:35.680
The nation's report card
just pointed out that

00:31:35.680 --> 00:31:39.860
in the fourth grade Texas
school children are 45th

00:31:39.860 --> 00:31:42.840
in the nation in achievement.

00:31:42.840 --> 00:31:44.810
Children are our
future; it seems pathetic

00:31:44.810 --> 00:31:46.640
to have to point that out.

00:31:46.640 --> 00:31:51.060
But the legislature has been
cutting back on its contribution

00:31:51.060 --> 00:31:56.310
to public education as a kind
of war on public schools.

00:31:56.310 --> 00:31:59.060
In a state that's projected
to double in 30 years,

00:31:59.060 --> 00:32:03.190
the challenges and
infrastructure are overwhelming.

00:32:03.190 --> 00:32:07.150
They were not nearly beginning
to meet that challenge.

00:32:07.150 --> 00:32:09.500
I'm thinking especially
of our coastal areas,

00:32:09.500 --> 00:32:14.580
which just a year ago this
week you know Harvey hit.

00:32:14.580 --> 00:32:18.430
And I was in Houston right
after that and it's a question

00:32:18.430 --> 00:32:21.730
about the survival, not
only of our coastal cities

00:32:21.730 --> 00:32:27.130
but the oil refineries and
storage tanks and ports that are

00:32:27.130 --> 00:32:29.610
so essential, not just
in the Texas economy,

00:32:29.610 --> 00:32:32.610
to the American economy.

00:32:32.610 --> 00:32:37.950
When we were led by climate
change skeptics this places our

00:32:37.950 --> 00:32:40.270
state in a certain peril.

00:32:40.270 --> 00:32:43.190
Now I think Texas is
a wonderful place.

00:32:43.190 --> 00:32:45.350
It's bold, it's created,
creative -

00:32:45.350 --> 00:32:47.720
it seems to have
a mandate to lead.

00:32:47.720 --> 00:32:52.470
And as Texans we need to make
sure we're up to the challenge

00:32:52.470 --> 00:32:56.470
to do less I think
would be unTexan.

00:32:56.470 --> 00:32:59.510
I'll be happy to
take your questions.

00:32:59.510 --> 00:33:10.840
[ Applause ]

00:33:10.840 --> 00:33:12.660
&gt;&gt; Mr. Wright, thank
you for your remarks.

00:33:12.660 --> 00:33:15.110
I know you didn't go to school
here, but since you live

00:33:15.110 --> 00:33:17.550
in Austin I wanted to ask
you if you have any comments

00:33:17.550 --> 00:33:21.560
about today's Texas/Maryland
football game.

00:33:21.560 --> 00:33:24.370
&gt;&gt; Lawrence Wright: Well we were
on a plane with a lot of them;

00:33:24.370 --> 00:33:27.720
unfortunately I was
not watching the game.

00:33:27.720 --> 00:33:32.360
I actually - you know we came
- my wife and I came yesterday

00:33:32.360 --> 00:33:36.290
and we went over to the Library
of Congress and I looked out

00:33:36.290 --> 00:33:38.680
and there were thousands
of people.

00:33:38.680 --> 00:33:41.860
And they were waiting to
say goodbye to John McCain.

00:33:41.860 --> 00:33:43.810
And it was really,
really touching to me

00:33:43.810 --> 00:33:46.030
so we watched the
funeral this afternoon.

00:33:46.030 --> 00:33:48.960
It was a very, very
moving moment.

00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:54.030
It could be who knows, a
small turn of the screw

00:33:54.030 --> 00:33:57.140
in improving our Democracy.

00:33:57.140 --> 00:33:58.840
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:33:58.840 --> 00:34:01.660
&gt;&gt; Would you be kind enough to
share with us your prediction

00:34:01.660 --> 00:34:03.110
of the outcome

00:34:03.110 --> 00:34:09.150
of the Cruz/O'Rourke
contest this November?

00:34:09.150 --> 00:34:11.610
And then would you
please give us a date

00:34:11.610 --> 00:34:14.570
when Texas will become
purple and the date

00:34:14.570 --> 00:34:16.510
when it will become blue?

00:34:16.510 --> 00:34:21.100
[ Laughter ]

00:34:21.100 --> 00:34:22.790
&gt;&gt; Lawrence Wright: You
know I can make up a figure

00:34:22.790 --> 00:34:29.230
about the odds and - because I
still think that it's a climb

00:34:29.230 --> 00:34:35.910
for Beto, not only is he a
Democrat, he's from El Paso.

00:34:35.910 --> 00:34:38.580
And for whatever reason we
have never elected anybody

00:34:38.580 --> 00:34:40.300
from El Peso to statewide
office.

00:34:40.300 --> 00:34:42.430
I don't know what it
is about that place.

00:34:42.430 --> 00:34:46.050
And - but I met him
only one time.

00:34:46.050 --> 00:34:48.160
It was at a Fox station
in Dallas

00:34:48.160 --> 00:34:50.420
and I was promoting
my book and at 7:00

00:34:50.420 --> 00:34:54.020
in the morning we are
in hair and makeup.

00:34:54.020 --> 00:34:56.980
And he has a kind of a
Jimmy Stewart quality.

00:34:56.980 --> 00:34:59.520
He's a very ingenuous guy.

00:34:59.520 --> 00:35:03.300
But he's on first so
we walk into the studio

00:35:03.300 --> 00:35:07.080
and the anchor comes
over and I don't know

00:35:07.080 --> 00:35:11.790
if Beto had said anything,
but the anchor says,

00:35:11.790 --> 00:35:16.710
"Well you're really handsome and
you're kind of tall, aren't you?

00:35:16.710 --> 00:35:20.100
And you've got the
charisma thing going".

00:35:20.100 --> 00:35:22.100
I thought maybe I'm
underestimating this guy.

00:35:22.100 --> 00:35:24.880
This is a Fox station in Dallas.

00:35:24.880 --> 00:35:32.610
I think it's you know, people
would say that he had no chance.

00:35:32.610 --> 00:35:36.480
And right now he's
within single digits.

00:35:36.480 --> 00:35:39.430
There's - he doesn't
have any support

00:35:39.430 --> 00:35:41.660
on the ticket and
that's a problem.

00:35:41.660 --> 00:35:49.040
So you know, I would say 60/40
but now I'm thinking 55/45.

00:35:49.040 --> 00:35:50.340
It's just a guess.

00:35:50.340 --> 00:35:55.440
The day, if he is
elected, Texas is purple.

00:35:55.440 --> 00:36:00.370
You know you can start - you can
mark that down on your calendar.

00:36:00.370 --> 00:36:02.080
&gt;&gt; How about the date
when it becomes blue?

00:36:02.080 --> 00:36:04.440
&gt;&gt; Lawrence Wright:
I can't go that far.

00:36:04.440 --> 00:36:07.340
My crystal ball is all cloudy.

00:36:07.340 --> 00:36:10.370
&gt;&gt; Hi Mr. Wright, I actually
grew up near Kilgore,

00:36:10.370 --> 00:36:13.630
so I'm very familiar with
the history you gave.

00:36:13.630 --> 00:36:20.000
So this book, did it
come about after having -

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:23.850
after you wrote their long
form article last summer?

00:36:23.850 --> 00:36:28.870
Did that - was that the genesis
to then like deepen that article

00:36:28.870 --> 00:36:30.360
and then write this book?

00:36:30.360 --> 00:36:31.840
&gt;&gt; Lawrence Wright: Yeah
I write for the New Yorker

00:36:31.840 --> 00:36:36.820
and my editor David
Remnick asked me, he said,

00:36:36.820 --> 00:36:40.370
"Larry I want you
to explain Texas".

00:36:41.920 --> 00:36:44.060
And because it is
a little mysterious

00:36:44.060 --> 00:36:46.130
to people why I live in Texas.

00:36:46.130 --> 00:36:48.750
And I reminded him that
I get paid by the word.

00:36:48.750 --> 00:36:53.510
It's a very big question
you just asked

00:36:53.510 --> 00:36:57.070
and so I started writing
and I couldn't stop.

00:36:57.070 --> 00:37:00.090
You know I had - I used
to work for Texas Monthly

00:37:00.090 --> 00:37:02.420
and I thought I'll never
write about Texas again.

00:37:02.420 --> 00:37:04.510
I don't want to be
a regional writer.

00:37:04.510 --> 00:37:11.630
And - but I couldn't stop,
so the book came out of that.

00:37:11.630 --> 00:37:13.210
&gt;&gt; Thank you for being
here, I loved the book.

00:37:13.210 --> 00:37:15.420
I grew up in Florida but
my brother goes to UT

00:37:15.420 --> 00:37:17.320
so I'm sort of Texas adjacent.

00:37:17.320 --> 00:37:22.730
My question is, I mean I guess
you just sort of answered it

00:37:22.730 --> 00:37:24.660
but when you were writing
this was the audience you had

00:37:24.660 --> 00:37:28.430
in mind sort of everyone else,
or was it people in Texas

00:37:28.430 --> 00:37:31.590
or a mix and how did that shape
you're reporting and the way

00:37:31.590 --> 00:37:32.990
that you wrote the book?

00:37:32.990 --> 00:37:35.980
&gt;&gt; Lawrence Wright: You know
that's an interesting question.

00:37:35.980 --> 00:37:39.860
I - part of it, I don't ever
really write for an audience.

00:37:39.860 --> 00:37:44.870
I kind of write to try to -
I want to write the book I'd

00:37:44.870 --> 00:37:46.820
like to read about something.

00:37:46.820 --> 00:37:51.690
And the - in this case I had -

00:37:51.690 --> 00:37:55.640
I know instinctively what
people think about Texas.

00:37:55.640 --> 00:37:59.260
Sometimes it's been stated
very much in my face.

00:37:59.260 --> 00:38:02.420
But I wanted to address
those things,

00:38:02.420 --> 00:38:04.240
but also I think
you know I wrote -

00:38:04.240 --> 00:38:06.200
years ago I wrote a
memoir about growing

00:38:06.200 --> 00:38:08.910
up in Dallas during the
Kennedy assassination.

00:38:08.910 --> 00:38:10.210
And one of the things

00:38:10.210 --> 00:38:14.610
that struck me was Texas has
rather impoverished literary

00:38:14.610 --> 00:38:21.190
archive and there just wasn't
very much said about what it was

00:38:21.190 --> 00:38:25.970
like to be from Texas or
from Dallas at that time.

00:38:25.970 --> 00:38:32.300
And your life is so enriched
when you say you grow

00:38:32.300 --> 00:38:35.050
up in Paris or Brooklyn even.

00:38:35.050 --> 00:38:37.720
You have all this
literature about it

00:38:37.720 --> 00:38:40.960
and it helps you understand
the culture you live in.

00:38:40.960 --> 00:38:44.550
So part of my goal was
to enlarge that archive

00:38:44.550 --> 00:38:51.730
and also I just had a really
lot of fun doing this and so I -

00:38:51.730 --> 00:38:54.150
it helped me understand
the place I live in

00:38:54.150 --> 00:38:56.510
and myself better in it.

00:38:56.510 --> 00:38:58.280
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:38:58.280 --> 00:39:00.050
&gt;&gt; Hi Lawrence, I
have a question

00:39:00.050 --> 00:39:02.130
about your previous book,
"The Looming Tower".

00:39:02.130 --> 00:39:07.060
So this is a book that outlines
a bunch of the extremists

00:39:07.060 --> 00:39:09.890
who were fighting the Soviets
in the 80's and then turned

00:39:09.890 --> 00:39:11.890
to the Americans in the 90's.

00:39:11.890 --> 00:39:13.660
One thing I have to
still get a full grasp

00:39:13.660 --> 00:39:17.440
on is how these guys could
suddenly in the late 80's

00:39:17.440 --> 00:39:19.810
and early 90's become so
hostile and aggressive

00:39:19.810 --> 00:39:22.600
against the country that for
a long time had been providing

00:39:22.600 --> 00:39:26.070
them arms and helping them
achieve a major political goal?

00:39:26.070 --> 00:39:28.570
So could you speak
to that some please?

00:39:28.570 --> 00:39:31.370
&gt;&gt; Lawrence Wright: Yeah,
the turn against America -

00:39:31.370 --> 00:39:35.550
you go back to think about some
of the Mujahedeen back then,

00:39:35.550 --> 00:39:38.170
there was a delegation that
came to the White House and one

00:39:38.170 --> 00:39:41.810
of them tried to convert
Ronald Reagan to Islam.

00:39:42.820 --> 00:39:46.300
Just think about how the
world would be different.

00:39:47.740 --> 00:39:53.160
But at that time we were on
good terms with the people

00:39:53.160 --> 00:39:56.050
who became the Taliban
in many respects.

00:39:56.050 --> 00:40:06.740
But the - once the Soviets
left there was really no reason

00:40:06.740 --> 00:40:10.300
geopolitical reason for us to
be in; so we left the country.

00:40:10.300 --> 00:40:16.540
And it was in chaos and
it turned to Civil War,

00:40:16.540 --> 00:40:19.910
and then it turned into a Jihad.

00:40:19.910 --> 00:40:23.220
And I don't think we would
have paid any attention

00:40:23.220 --> 00:40:28.330
to it really were
it not for 9/11.

00:40:28.330 --> 00:40:33.670
You know Steve Cole was
speaking earlier and you know

00:40:33.670 --> 00:40:37.430
if Taliban weren't on our
radar, but 9/11 changed all

00:40:37.430 --> 00:40:39.390
that because they were
hosting Bin Laden.

00:40:39.390 --> 00:40:42.920
They weren't participating
in the war on America.

00:40:42.920 --> 00:40:46.980
But because they created a
sanctuary that made it possible

00:40:46.980 --> 00:40:51.580
for Al Qaeda to train
its soldiers.

00:40:51.580 --> 00:40:55.850
You know they had the
opportunity to return him

00:40:55.850 --> 00:40:57.720
and they failed to
take that opportunity,

00:40:57.720 --> 00:41:00.690
so the hammer came down.

00:41:00.690 --> 00:41:05.230
But now it's the longest
running war we've ever been in.

00:41:05.230 --> 00:41:07.340
Wish I had a better
answer for you then.

00:41:07.340 --> 00:41:11.210
&gt;&gt; Hi there, I'm from New
Jersey but my first exposure

00:41:11.210 --> 00:41:13.270
to Texas was when
I was six years old

00:41:13.270 --> 00:41:18.000
and I met Sandy Cheeks,
SpongeBob's friend from Texas.

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:20.410
People from my generation
will probably understand

00:41:20.410 --> 00:41:22.130
where that comes from.

00:41:22.130 --> 00:41:26.070
But my question is you
talked a little bit before

00:41:26.070 --> 00:41:29.550
about how California and Texas
were mirrors of each other

00:41:29.550 --> 00:41:31.290
and I think that
also kind of exists

00:41:31.290 --> 00:41:34.350
in the way those two states
have handled their approaches

00:41:34.350 --> 00:41:36.420
to race and higher education.

00:41:36.420 --> 00:41:40.200
Have you explored that or can
you comment about that whereas

00:41:40.200 --> 00:41:45.160
in California they can't use
race to - as a consideration

00:41:45.160 --> 00:41:48.790
for the UC system or as in
Texas it was kind of upheld

00:41:48.790 --> 00:41:52.710
that race could be
used as one metric.

00:41:52.710 --> 00:41:57.260
&gt;&gt; Lawrence Wright: I thought
the University of Texas had kind

00:41:57.260 --> 00:42:03.300
of ingenious idea about how
to handle race admissions.

00:42:03.300 --> 00:42:10.370
They decided to take
to admit the top 10%

00:42:10.370 --> 00:42:15.250
of all public school
students who applied.

00:42:15.250 --> 00:42:19.120
And the assumption was that the
schools themselves were also

00:42:19.120 --> 00:42:22.820
segregated, so they were
going to be a large number

00:42:22.820 --> 00:42:26.360
of minority students coming
out of minority schools.

00:42:26.360 --> 00:42:30.200
And it didn't work.

00:42:30.200 --> 00:42:32.520
The truth is minority population

00:42:32.520 --> 00:42:38.160
in the African American minority
population in the University

00:42:38.160 --> 00:42:40.400
of Texas is very, very small.

00:42:40.400 --> 00:42:44.690
And then the Hispanic
population has increased

00:42:44.690 --> 00:42:47.570
but it has not been
effective and both

00:42:47.570 --> 00:42:52.090
of these school systems
are circumscribed by laws

00:42:52.090 --> 00:42:56.050
that make it very
difficult to entice

00:42:56.050 --> 00:43:00.790
or recruit minority
students into those systems.

00:43:00.790 --> 00:43:03.910
And I don't know exactly how
we're going to go about fixing

00:43:03.910 --> 00:43:07.240
because the court is
fighting against it.

00:43:07.240 --> 00:43:09.140
And rules are really unclear.

00:43:09.140 --> 00:43:11.410
I think that's true
in California as well.

00:43:11.410 --> 00:43:16.410
&gt;&gt; My question is about
the Texas economy.

00:43:16.410 --> 00:43:19.600
You said the future is Texas and
I guess that will be the case

00:43:19.600 --> 00:43:23.030
if the state's economy continues
to grow at the rate that it has

00:43:23.030 --> 00:43:26.580
and people come there for the
jobs as they have in the past.

00:43:26.580 --> 00:43:29.320
So I'm just wondering how much
of - in your view how much

00:43:29.320 --> 00:43:33.230
of the state's economic
growth is due to the low tax,

00:43:33.230 --> 00:43:35.310
low regulation policies
that have sort

00:43:35.310 --> 00:43:36.780
of defined Texas's approach?

00:43:36.780 --> 00:43:41.440
Versus frankly just the good
luck of having oil in the ground

00:43:41.440 --> 00:43:43.190
and natural gas in the ground?

00:43:43.190 --> 00:43:45.160
&gt;&gt; Lawrence Wright:
That's a good question.

00:43:45.160 --> 00:43:50.470
As I say Texas wouldn't
be Texas without the oil.

00:43:50.470 --> 00:43:54.270
And yet I do think that
businesses migrated to Texas

00:43:54.270 --> 00:43:57.090
because they see it
as a freebie in a way.

00:43:57.090 --> 00:44:01.900
So they're liberated from
taxes and they don't -

00:44:01.900 --> 00:44:05.300
because most industries are not
social welfare organizations.

00:44:05.300 --> 00:44:06.600
They don't care that much

00:44:06.600 --> 00:44:09.160
about the consequences
of their behavior.

00:44:09.160 --> 00:44:13.620
And Texas is very stingy
in terms of its social net.

00:44:13.620 --> 00:44:17.010
And if you subtract money
from public schools,

00:44:17.010 --> 00:44:19.870
which is almost the primary
organization of government,

00:44:19.870 --> 00:44:21.540
well then it's cheaper, right?

00:44:21.540 --> 00:44:24.530
Of course you're
failing your children

00:44:24.530 --> 00:44:27.710
and you're not providing
for the future of your own -

00:44:27.710 --> 00:44:29.480
your workers as a future.

00:44:29.480 --> 00:44:32.470
So it is a conundrum.

00:44:32.470 --> 00:44:37.650
Texas can afford to be more
generous and more far sighted

00:44:37.650 --> 00:44:39.710
and that's what I'm
constantly harping on.

00:44:39.710 --> 00:44:43.320
It's not - I think there
may be some trauma left

00:44:43.320 --> 00:44:45.960
over from these many busts
that we've been through

00:44:45.960 --> 00:44:49.940
and Texas was never
rich in the ways

00:44:49.940 --> 00:44:51.730
that people think
of it as being rich.

00:44:51.730 --> 00:44:55.530
I mean there are more
millionaires per capita in -

00:44:55.530 --> 00:44:59.070
well certainly in
Connecticut and Maryland,

00:44:59.070 --> 00:45:02.280
but there was one -
South Dakota I think?

00:45:02.280 --> 00:45:04.900
Yeah some places that
you think, really?

00:45:04.900 --> 00:45:08.650
But everybody used to
- when good times are

00:45:08.650 --> 00:45:11.760
in Texas you would see
these oversized dollars

00:45:11.760 --> 00:45:13.300
for sale in the airport.

00:45:13.300 --> 00:45:16.060
And so the oil is
really flowing,

00:45:16.060 --> 00:45:19.360
but it never really
flowed down to the people.

00:45:19.360 --> 00:45:23.070
But that doesn't mean that
there wasn't money gushing

00:45:23.070 --> 00:45:24.370
through the state.

00:45:24.370 --> 00:45:29.010
And we'd be far - and also I
think we've been in provident

00:45:29.010 --> 00:45:32.410
in our state government,
California,

00:45:32.410 --> 00:45:35.610
the liberals they
left their government

00:45:35.610 --> 00:45:41.050
with an 8 billion dollar
surplus and Texas - excuse me,

00:45:41.050 --> 00:45:43.150
6 billion dollar
surplus in California

00:45:43.150 --> 00:45:45.810
and Texas has an 8
billion dollar deficit.

00:45:45.810 --> 00:45:49.160
So you wonder where the fiscal
conservatives really are.

00:45:49.160 --> 00:45:50.460
Thank you.

00:45:50.460 --> 00:45:51.760
Can I just finish with these

00:45:51.760 --> 00:45:53.060
because we're the
last speakers, right?

00:45:53.060 --> 00:45:56.540
So nobody else, but you guys
I'll take your questions.

00:45:56.540 --> 00:45:58.260
Yes sir?

00:45:58.260 --> 00:46:03.790
&gt;&gt; You make a lot of point of
comparing Texas and California.

00:46:03.790 --> 00:46:07.770
Being from New York and
living a lot of my recent time

00:46:07.770 --> 00:46:11.810
in Florida I'm wondering what
Texans think of New Yorkers

00:46:11.810 --> 00:46:14.830
or Floridians as in contrast

00:46:14.830 --> 00:46:17.430
to what they might
think of California?

00:46:17.430 --> 00:46:21.240
&gt;&gt; Lawrence Wright: Well Florida
is sort of equally crazy.

00:46:21.240 --> 00:46:26.530
So there's a kind of affection
and tolerance I think of

00:46:26.530 --> 00:46:30.380
and it's seen as
where a sunshine state

00:46:30.380 --> 00:46:36.170
and there's a consonants
in our politics I think.

00:46:36.170 --> 00:46:39.770
Although Florida seems to be
a little more influx in terms

00:46:39.770 --> 00:46:42.070
of its politics right now.

00:46:42.070 --> 00:46:48.190
New York, I adore New
York and - but you know

00:46:48.190 --> 00:46:52.290
for a long time New York
was seen as the embodiment

00:46:52.290 --> 00:46:54.830
of all the things that
we're fighting against.

00:46:54.830 --> 00:46:59.780
And yet you know our
country wouldn't be the same

00:46:59.780 --> 00:47:01.770
if it weren't for all
these different entities

00:47:01.770 --> 00:47:05.160
that we management to create.

00:47:07.170 --> 00:47:10.060
&gt;&gt; My son graduate
from Rice in May,

00:47:10.060 --> 00:47:12.250
he's a native Washingtonian.

00:47:12.250 --> 00:47:13.860
And over the four years he was

00:47:13.860 --> 00:47:18.040
at Rice our family really
loved learning a little bit

00:47:18.040 --> 00:47:19.340
about Texas.

00:47:19.340 --> 00:47:21.790
I'm sad that we won't
have a reason

00:47:21.790 --> 00:47:24.320
to go back there any time soon.

00:47:24.320 --> 00:47:26.740
But I'm wondering since we
are at the book festival

00:47:26.740 --> 00:47:29.840
and since you mentioned
that you felt as a Texas

00:47:29.840 --> 00:47:33.870
that there maybe wasn't a
literary legacy for you.

00:47:33.870 --> 00:47:44.390
Is there a book that you would
recommend, aside from your own,

00:47:44.390 --> 00:47:46.470
novel, history, anything that
you would recommend to folks

00:47:46.470 --> 00:47:47.810
who want to learn a
little more about Texas?

00:47:47.810 --> 00:47:50.070
&gt;&gt; Lawrence Wright: In my book
I'd write about Stephen Harrigan

00:47:50.070 --> 00:47:51.790
who is my best friend and I
think he's the best writer

00:47:51.790 --> 00:47:53.090
that Texas ever produced.

00:47:53.090 --> 00:47:56.040
And he has a novel called
"Gates of the Alamo"

00:47:56.040 --> 00:47:57.990
that is just wonderful.

00:47:57.990 --> 00:48:01.060
But I've just finished
reading a manuscript.

00:48:01.060 --> 00:48:06.560
His history of Texas, which
is you know magisterial.

00:48:06.560 --> 00:48:09.190
And it's going to come out
in the fall of next year.

00:48:09.190 --> 00:48:14.130
And its tentative title is "Big
Wonderful Thing in the World".

00:48:14.130 --> 00:48:17.510
But it's - his book is
a big wonderful thing.

00:48:17.510 --> 00:48:20.230
&gt;&gt; I should have
said in addition -

00:48:20.230 --> 00:48:23.360
&gt;&gt; Lawrence Wright: That's fine;
I marked you down right away.

00:48:23.360 --> 00:48:27.890
&gt;&gt; You mentioned that Texas used

00:48:27.890 --> 00:48:32.160
to be much more blue
or just blue overall.

00:48:32.160 --> 00:48:35.760
Assuming that people don't move
out in droves, does that mean -

00:48:35.760 --> 00:48:42.810
is the older generation
also more progressive?

00:48:42.810 --> 00:48:46.760
&gt;&gt; Lawrence Wright: Well
no, the primary voters,

00:48:46.760 --> 00:48:50.960
the Republican primary voters
have been determining the

00:48:50.960 --> 00:48:53.500
politics of the state
for decades.

00:48:53.500 --> 00:49:00.090
I read a figure that there
are more of them over the age

00:49:00.090 --> 00:49:04.210
of 65 then are under
the age of 50.

00:49:04.210 --> 00:49:06.810
Now that demarcation
tells you a lot.

00:49:06.810 --> 00:49:08.110
You know there is a kind

00:49:08.110 --> 00:49:12.410
of dinosaur era that's
moving into the past.

00:49:12.410 --> 00:49:18.140
And you know who will
come in the wake of them?

00:49:18.140 --> 00:49:23.240
It's hard to say, but I
don't think that the -

00:49:23.240 --> 00:49:25.860
I think that the kind
of reactionary politics

00:49:25.860 --> 00:49:27.160
that we've seen in the state

00:49:27.160 --> 00:49:31.690
for a while are people
are really tired of it.

00:49:31.690 --> 00:49:34.760
This attack on public
schools at the same time

00:49:34.760 --> 00:49:39.800
that we were having this
argument about bathrooms.

00:49:39.800 --> 00:49:43.510
And whether transgender
people can move,

00:49:43.510 --> 00:49:46.420
migrate from one
bathroom to another.

00:49:46.420 --> 00:49:49.540
That was the sole discussion
about public education

00:49:49.540 --> 00:49:52.370
in this past legislative
session.

00:49:52.370 --> 00:49:53.670
That's shameful.

00:49:53.670 --> 00:49:56.830
That's an avoidance
of the responsibility

00:49:56.830 --> 00:49:58.370
that these people have.

00:49:58.370 --> 00:50:04.670
And I'm hopeful that you know
in the next session which begins

00:50:04.670 --> 00:50:07.380
in January we'll have a
more sober minded group

00:50:07.380 --> 00:50:08.680
of people there.

00:50:08.680 --> 00:50:11.350
But if not, believe me
I'll be on their case.

00:50:11.350 --> 00:50:16.620
&gt;&gt; Mr. Wright, I
grew up in California

00:50:16.620 --> 00:50:20.490
and then more recently
spent 10 years in Houston.

00:50:20.490 --> 00:50:25.380
And actually loved it
as well and was there

00:50:25.380 --> 00:50:28.460
when they actually
elected a lesbian as mayor

00:50:28.460 --> 00:50:31.620
and when we moved there,
there was an African American

00:50:31.620 --> 00:50:33.610
and currently there was
another African American -

00:50:33.610 --> 00:50:37.110
I was wondering I you
could comment on a part

00:50:37.110 --> 00:50:42.290
of the economy related to
energy aside from the petroleum

00:50:42.290 --> 00:50:46.220
and gas industry, and that's
the wind energy growth?

00:50:46.220 --> 00:50:48.270
&gt;&gt; Lawrence Wright: Yeah,
thank you for bringing that up.

00:50:48.270 --> 00:50:53.210
Texas drives more power from
wind than any other state.

00:50:53.210 --> 00:50:58.570
Currently 15% of the power
in Texas comes from wind.

00:50:58.570 --> 00:51:02.630
And solar is coming
along, not as quickly.

00:51:02.630 --> 00:51:05.700
I don't know why, we've
got plenty of sun.

00:51:05.700 --> 00:51:11.170
But the - there's one
very conservative town,

00:51:11.170 --> 00:51:14.510
Georgetown which is north
of Austin which gets all

00:51:14.510 --> 00:51:17.390
of its energy from
renewable sources.

00:51:17.390 --> 00:51:20.400
And Dallas and some other places

00:51:20.400 --> 00:51:24.330
in Texas you can
choose an energy plan.

00:51:24.330 --> 00:51:31.590
And you can choose to have
renewable only sources.

00:51:31.590 --> 00:51:37.030
And if you choose that the
energy at night is free.

00:51:37.030 --> 00:51:41.190
Free. The wind blows more at
night and they have to unload it

00:51:41.190 --> 00:51:45.350
and so it's hard to beat
free in terms of pricing.

00:51:45.350 --> 00:51:50.280
But you know it's - I think
it's - I have to give credit

00:51:50.280 --> 00:51:54.870
to Rick Perry, he's the governor
that instigated that and I wish

00:51:54.870 --> 00:51:57.590
as energy secretary that
he would remember some

00:51:57.590 --> 00:52:00.000
of the legacy he
left behind in Texas.

00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:01.300
Last question.

00:52:01.300 --> 00:52:06.940
&gt;&gt; Well Mr. Wright, thank
you for coming to this event.

00:52:06.940 --> 00:52:12.140
My mother recently moved to
Houston, I'm from California,

00:52:12.140 --> 00:52:16.820
so I like and interested in this
comparison that you're drawing

00:52:16.820 --> 00:52:18.720
between the two states.

00:52:18.720 --> 00:52:22.990
When I went to visit her in
Houston the thing I noticed

00:52:22.990 --> 00:52:25.840
about Texans is they're
the only state I know

00:52:25.840 --> 00:52:29.900
that wears earrings
of their state.

00:52:29.900 --> 00:52:37.240
I don't notice people from Ohio
wearing like Ohio earrings.

00:52:37.240 --> 00:52:39.420
But at any right, that aside,

00:52:39.420 --> 00:52:42.310
the first thing you
mentioned was about Houston

00:52:42.310 --> 00:52:45.940
that they don't have
a zoning policy.

00:52:45.940 --> 00:52:48.360
Can you elaborate?

00:52:48.360 --> 00:52:52.650
When I visit her I notice that
and about how weird that makes

00:52:52.650 --> 00:52:57.200
"weird", how unique -
I'll say it that way;

00:52:57.200 --> 00:53:00.490
how unique that makes Houston.

00:53:00.490 --> 00:53:02.780
Why doesn't it?

00:53:02.780 --> 00:53:04.080
Do you know the history -

00:53:04.080 --> 00:53:07.050
&gt;&gt; Lawrence Wright: Yeah it
was to keep the companies out.

00:53:07.050 --> 00:53:11.490
&gt;&gt; Oh of course.

00:53:11.490 --> 00:53:14.480
&gt;&gt; Lawrence Wright: Zoning
was a communist plot.

00:53:14.480 --> 00:53:17.970
And the 50's this was -

00:53:23.630 --> 00:53:27.970
In the 50's it was assumed
that this was a real threat.

00:53:27.970 --> 00:53:32.350
And so they decided that
there would be no zoning

00:53:32.350 --> 00:53:40.530
and the liberals thought maybe
that's not such a bad thing.

00:53:40.530 --> 00:53:44.760
Because it will make it easier
to integrate our housing.

00:53:44.760 --> 00:53:47.330
And it did.

00:53:47.330 --> 00:53:50.610
And one of the things
about the no zoning things,

00:53:50.610 --> 00:53:52.920
Houston is constantly -

00:53:52.920 --> 00:53:55.090
it's like a school teacher
erasing the blackboard

00:53:55.090 --> 00:53:56.620
and doing this again.

00:53:56.620 --> 00:53:59.960
So it's constantly
erasing and creating

00:53:59.960 --> 00:54:02.420
but it has affordable housing.

00:54:02.420 --> 00:54:05.340
And you know, compare
that to the city as most

00:54:05.340 --> 00:54:09.570
like Los Angeles,
it's very difficult

00:54:09.570 --> 00:54:11.490
to find affordable
housing there.

00:54:11.490 --> 00:54:18.780
So I'm kind of forgiving about
the - it's an experiment.

00:54:18.780 --> 00:54:21.750
But you know it has
its up sides.

00:54:21.750 --> 00:54:27.300
It can be - it can be kind
of crazy, but that's -

00:54:27.300 --> 00:54:28.600
if you're going to spend time

00:54:28.600 --> 00:54:30.290
in Houston you have
to get over that.

00:54:30.290 --> 00:54:34.840
&gt;&gt; Not going to get
over it, it's unique

00:54:34.840 --> 00:54:36.840
and I can't think of any other -

00:54:36.840 --> 00:54:38.140
&gt;&gt; I don't think
there's another -

00:54:38.140 --> 00:54:40.660
&gt;&gt; Wondering what
the history was.

00:54:40.660 --> 00:54:44.010
&gt;&gt; Well listen thank you guys;
it's been great talking to you.

00:54:44.010 --> 00:54:46.000
