00:00:01.018 --> 00:00:01.851
- [Voiceover] Now I'm gonna show you

00:00:01.851 --> 00:00:04.174
what a circuit, that's
called a voltage divider.

00:00:04.174 --> 00:00:06.229
This is the name we
give to a simple circuit

00:00:06.229 --> 00:00:08.617
of two series resistors.

00:00:08.617 --> 00:00:11.416
So, I'm just gonna draw
two series resistors here.

00:00:11.416 --> 00:00:13.566
And it's a nickname, in the sense of,

00:00:13.566 --> 00:00:15.939
it's just a pattern that we see

00:00:15.939 --> 00:00:18.647
when we look at circuits.

00:00:18.647 --> 00:00:20.643
And, I'll show you what the pattern is.

00:00:20.643 --> 00:00:22.711
The pattern is,

00:00:22.711 --> 00:00:23.544
we have

00:00:25.051 --> 00:00:26.131
two resistors in series.

00:00:26.131 --> 00:00:28.103
It's no more than that.

00:00:28.103 --> 00:00:32.400
And we assume that there's
a voltage over here.

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:35.823
We hook up a voltage over here like this.

00:00:35.823 --> 00:00:38.162
So, that's called an input voltage.

00:00:38.162 --> 00:00:41.393
We'll call it 'VI', for 'V in'.

00:00:41.393 --> 00:00:43.476
And then, the midpoint of

00:00:44.535 --> 00:00:46.040
the two resistors,

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:48.363
and typically the bottom,

00:00:48.363 --> 00:00:50.041
that's called the 'out'.

00:00:50.041 --> 00:00:51.717
So, we basically

00:00:51.717 --> 00:00:54.396
just have a pattern here
with the series resistor,

00:00:54.396 --> 00:00:57.763
driven by some voltage from
the ends of the two resistors.

00:00:57.763 --> 00:01:00.918
And we're curious about the
voltage across one of them.

00:01:00.918 --> 00:01:03.523
So now we're gonna develop
an expression for this.

00:01:03.523 --> 00:01:06.129
Let's also label our resistors.

00:01:06.129 --> 00:01:08.202
This will be 'R1'.

00:01:08.202 --> 00:01:10.035
And this will be 'R2'.

00:01:10.976 --> 00:01:13.989
That's how we tell our resistors apart.

00:01:13.989 --> 00:01:16.525
And we're gonna develop
an expression for this.

00:01:16.525 --> 00:01:17.358
So,

00:01:18.195 --> 00:01:20.262
let's first put a current through here.

00:01:20.262 --> 00:01:22.675
We'll call that current 'i'.

00:01:22.675 --> 00:01:24.277
We'll make an assumption

00:01:24.277 --> 00:01:26.822
that this current here, is zero.

00:01:26.822 --> 00:01:28.803
There's no current going out of our

00:01:28.803 --> 00:01:29.915
little circuit here.

00:01:29.915 --> 00:01:31.142
And that means, of course,

00:01:31.142 --> 00:01:33.972
that this current here is also 'i'.

00:01:33.972 --> 00:01:36.212
So, it's continuous all the way down.

00:01:36.212 --> 00:01:37.941
And now we want to develop an expression

00:01:37.941 --> 00:01:40.103
that tells us what 'V out' is,

00:01:40.103 --> 00:01:42.304
in terms of these two resistors

00:01:42.304 --> 00:01:44.106
and the input voltage.

00:01:44.106 --> 00:01:45.910
So let's go over here and do that.

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:48.062
First thing we're gonna write is,

00:01:48.062 --> 00:01:49.860
we know that,

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.095
using Ohm's law,

00:01:51.095 --> 00:01:53.270
we can write an expression for

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:56.446
these series resistors on this side here.

00:01:56.446 --> 00:01:58.562
Ohm's law, we'll put over here.

00:01:58.562 --> 00:02:01.645
'V' equals 'iR'.

00:02:02.766 --> 00:02:05.333
In a specific case here,

00:02:05.333 --> 00:02:09.443
'V in' equals 'i' times what?

00:02:09.443 --> 00:02:12.553
Times the series combination
of 'R1' and 'R2'.

00:02:12.553 --> 00:02:14.702
And the series combination is the sum:

00:02:14.702 --> 00:02:17.035
'R1' plus 'R2'.

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:22.280
I'm gonna solve this for 'i'.

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:23.697
'i' equals

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:28.326
'V in' divided by

00:02:28.326 --> 00:02:30.909
'R1' plus 'R2'.

00:02:33.981 --> 00:02:35.665
Alright, next step is gonna be,

00:02:35.665 --> 00:02:36.767
let's solve for--

00:02:36.767 --> 00:02:40.055
let's write an expression
that's related to 'V out'.

00:02:40.055 --> 00:02:43.749
And 'V out' only depends on
'R2' and this current here.

00:02:43.749 --> 00:02:46.161
So we can write 'V out'

00:02:46.161 --> 00:02:49.411
equals 'i' times 'R2'.

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:55.675
And I'll solve this equation
for 'i' the same way.

00:02:55.675 --> 00:02:59.175
Equals 'V zero' over 'R2'

00:03:00.483 --> 00:03:02.712
And now we have two expressions for 'i'

00:03:02.712 --> 00:03:03.567
in our circuit,

00:03:03.567 --> 00:03:06.759
because we made this assumption
of zero current going out,

00:03:06.759 --> 00:03:08.898
those two 'i's' are the same.

00:03:08.898 --> 00:03:11.233
So, let's set those equal to each other

00:03:11.233 --> 00:03:12.696
and see what we get.

00:03:12.696 --> 00:03:14.363
'i' is

00:03:15.775 --> 00:03:19.192
'V zero' over 'R2',

00:03:20.772 --> 00:03:23.522
equals 'V1'

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:27.983
over 'R1' plus 'R2'.

00:03:29.944 --> 00:03:31.570
So now I'm gonna take 'R2'

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:34.061
and move it over to the
other side of the equation.

00:03:34.061 --> 00:03:38.228
And we get 'V out' equals 'V1'.

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:42.691
Sorry, 'V in' times

00:03:42.691 --> 00:03:46.516
'R2' over

00:03:46.516 --> 00:03:49.183
'R1' plus 'R2'.

00:03:52.647 --> 00:03:54.398
And this is called,

00:03:54.398 --> 00:03:56.810
this is called the voltage
divider expression.

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:57.727
Right here.

00:04:01.463 --> 00:04:03.846
It gives us an expression for 'V out',

00:04:03.846 --> 00:04:04.793
in terms of 'V in',

00:04:04.793 --> 00:04:06.897
and the ratio of resistors.

00:04:06.897 --> 00:04:09.513
Resistors are always positive numbers.

00:04:09.513 --> 00:04:12.013
And so this fraction is always

00:04:13.341 --> 00:04:14.441
less than one.

00:04:14.441 --> 00:04:15.574
Which means that 'V out'

00:04:15.574 --> 00:04:17.760
is always somewhat less than 'V in'.

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:18.926
And it's adjustable,

00:04:18.926 --> 00:04:20.774
by adjusting the resistor values.

00:04:20.774 --> 00:04:24.304
It's a really handy circuit to have.

00:04:24.304 --> 00:04:25.976
Let's do some examples.

00:04:25.976 --> 00:04:30.059
We'll put that up in the
corner so we can see it.

00:04:30.945 --> 00:04:31.778
Then real quick,

00:04:31.778 --> 00:04:35.945
I'm gonna build a voltage
divider that we can practice on.

00:04:37.659 --> 00:04:41.120
Let's make this '2k'
ohms, two thousand ohms.

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:43.350
We'll make this 6000 ohms,

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:46.166
or '6k' ohms.

00:04:46.166 --> 00:04:48.255
And we'll hook it up to

00:04:48.255 --> 00:04:50.922
an input source that looks like,

00:04:52.124 --> 00:04:54.041
let's say it's 6 volts.

00:04:56.478 --> 00:04:57.311
Like that.

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:01.488
And we'll take an output off of this.

00:05:01.488 --> 00:05:05.221
Right here, is where the output
of our voltage divider is.

00:05:05.221 --> 00:05:08.054
And we'll say that that is

00:05:09.904 --> 00:05:10.737
'V out'.

00:05:12.208 --> 00:05:13.239
So let's solve this

00:05:13.239 --> 00:05:16.133
using the voltage divider expression.

00:05:16.133 --> 00:05:18.453
'V out' equals

00:05:18.453 --> 00:05:20.536
'V in', which is 6 volts.

00:05:21.493 --> 00:05:23.910
Times the ratio of resistors.

00:05:24.777 --> 00:05:27.610
'R2' is '6k' ohms,

00:05:28.967 --> 00:05:31.885
divided by '2k' ohms,

00:05:31.885 --> 00:05:35.218
plus '6k' ohms.

00:05:36.337 --> 00:05:37.911
And notice this always happens,

00:05:37.911 --> 00:05:39.371
the 'k's' all cancel out.

00:05:39.371 --> 00:05:40.986
That's nice.

00:05:40.986 --> 00:05:42.901
And that equals

00:05:42.901 --> 00:05:44.920
six times,

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:47.587
six over, two plus six is eight.

00:05:48.848 --> 00:05:51.189
And if I do my calculations right,

00:05:51.189 --> 00:05:55.356
'V out' is 4.5 volts.

00:05:56.976 --> 00:05:58.677
So that's what a voltage divider is.

00:05:58.677 --> 00:06:00.909
And if you remember at the beginning,

00:06:00.909 --> 00:06:02.075
if you remember at the beginning,

00:06:02.075 --> 00:06:03.739
we made an assumption

00:06:03.739 --> 00:06:05.729
that this current going out here,

00:06:05.729 --> 00:06:08.314
was appr-- about zero.

00:06:08.314 --> 00:06:09.542
If that current is really small,

00:06:09.542 --> 00:06:12.057
you can use this voltage
divider expression.

00:06:12.057 --> 00:06:14.243
Which as, we see up here,

00:06:14.243 --> 00:06:17.633
is the ratio of the bottom
resistor to both resistors.

00:06:17.633 --> 00:06:19.040
That's how I remember it.

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:20.514
It's the bottom resistor,

00:06:20.514 --> 00:06:24.274
over the two resistors added together.

00:06:24.274 --> 00:06:27.059
If you think the current
is not very small,

00:06:27.059 --> 00:06:29.513
what you do is you go back
and you do this analysis.

00:06:29.513 --> 00:06:31.633
You do the same analysis again

00:06:31.633 --> 00:06:35.495
but you account for the
current that's in here.

00:06:35.495 --> 00:06:38.659
So that's the story on voltage dividers
