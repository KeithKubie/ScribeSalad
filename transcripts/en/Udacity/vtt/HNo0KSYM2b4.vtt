00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:02.340
Now, if I was looking at the scatter file,

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:04.290
I would say that the correlation between these two

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.624
variables is about zero. Now, the autograder would have

00:00:07.624 --> 00:00:10.917
accepted anything between negative 2 10ths and positive 2/10. We

00:00:10.917 --> 00:00:14.780
just wanted something reasonable. Now, to actually calculate the

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:18.330
correlation, we'd run cor.test function on Mitchell Month in

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.680
Mitchell Temp. It turns out that the actual value

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:24.360
is 57000ths, seems like a pretty weak correlation to me.
