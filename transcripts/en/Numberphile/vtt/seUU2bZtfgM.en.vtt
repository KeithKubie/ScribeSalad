00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:02.470
SIMON PAMPENA: It's
mind blowing.

00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:05.470
I learned this when I was
at uni, the existence of

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:07.010
transcendental numbers.

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:08.680
And the name was a
selling point.

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:09.730
Because I was like,
transcendental.

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:12.870
You know, it's a time when
you're really interested in,

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.400
like, out of body experiences
and whatnot.

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:18.970
But the idea that mathematicians
gave this name

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:22.100
to numbers, numbers, these
are numbers that

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:22.840
you're familiar with.

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:26.520
Like pi, you can write down
as a decimal expansion.

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:29.070
You'll never get it right, but
it's just a number that you're

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.130
familiar with.

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:33.230
Has this property that we
just didn't know about.

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:34.850
OK, we're going to play a game,
and we're going to try

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:38.600
and understand transcendental
numbers with this game.

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.150
The game is reducing
down numbers to 0.

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:43.130
That's what you want to do.

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:46.700
So the rules are you can only
use whole numbers to do it,

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:51.970
and you can add, take, multiply,
and put the whole

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:54.060
thing to any power you like,
but it has to be a whole

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:55.020
number power.

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.150
OK, so let's play the game.

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:58.763
OK, so do you have a
favorite number?

00:00:58.763 --> 00:01:00.500
BRADY HARAN: Well, I
like the number 10.

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.990
SIMON PAMPENA: 10?

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:02.060
BRADY HARAN: Yeah, but that
seems like quite an easy one.

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.620
SIMON PAMPENA: Sure.

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:03.310
That's fine.

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:05.019
You mean 10 in base 10?

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:05.810
BRADY HARAN: 10 in base 10.

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:06.260
SIMON PAMPENA: Yeah, OK.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:07.230
So 10 in base 10.

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:07.880
OK, here we go.

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:08.710
Let's start the game.

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:11.530
So we want to get this down to
0, so the first thing we could

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:14.690
do is multiply it by 0.

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:17.450
But that you can do with any
number, because any number

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:18.950
times 0 is--

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:20.080
BRADY HARAN: 0.

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:20.630
SIMON PAMPENA: Bingo.

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:22.760
You can do that, but that's
not very interesting.

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:25.790
But what is interesting is that
if we try and use these

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:28.680
rules, we can go, OK, what
happens if I take

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.490
away 10 from this?

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:33.020
We're done.

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.820
So there you go.

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:36.820
So that sounds kind of trivial,
but it's a really

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:38.070
good start.

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.610
So we used a whole number,
and we used the take.

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:40.610
What about something else?

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:43.130
How about 3/4?

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:46.380
First of all, let's
multiply it by 4.

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:47.790
OK, so these things
will cancel.

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:48.740
You get 3.

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.120
Now we can take away
3, we'll get 0.

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.920
Excellent.

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.480
But what about something
crazier?

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:56.220
What about like a really
crazy number?

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:59.820
What about like, the
square root of 2?

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.710
I think you guys know about
the square of 2.

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:02.280
BRADY HARAN: Yes, we do.

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.560
That's irrational, isn't it?

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:04.880
SIMON PAMPENA: It's an
irrational number, and

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.750
irrational means it can't be
expressed as a fraction.

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:10.770
So the square root of 2 is kind
of a very strange number,

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:14.600
and so this little thing here,
I often say this little thing

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:15.495
here is like a little
sentence.

00:02:15.495 --> 00:02:18.390
It says, what number multiplied
by itself gives you

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.885
this number?

00:02:18.885 --> 00:02:21.510
That's the way I think of
the square root sign.

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.400
So I don't know what number
multiplied by itself gives me

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.000
2, but that doesn't matter.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.850
Now, what we'll do is
to try and get this

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:29.960
one down to 0, OK?

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:31.470
First of all, we'll have to--

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:32.630
BRADY HARAN: OK, that, I
reckon I can do that.

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.750
SIMON PAMPENA: Well, tell me.

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:36.780
BRADY HARAN: I reckon if we
raise that to a power--

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:37.290
SIMON PAMPENA: Yep.

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:38.030
What power?

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:40.910
BRADY HARAN: Let's raise
it to the power of 2?

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:41.660
SIMON PAMPENA: Correct,
so that's

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:42.900
multiplying it by itself.

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.578
And then what do you
get in the middle?

00:02:45.578 --> 00:02:46.960
BRADY HARAN: You're going
to get 2, I'd bet.

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:47.430
SIMON PAMPENA: That's right.

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.220
So now you've got 2 in there,
so what are you going to do?

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:50.030
BRADY HARAN: Subtract 2.

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.840
SIMON PAMPENA: Yes!

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:51.400
So look at that.

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.350
So you've just taken an
irrational number, and with

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:55.870
this game you've brought
it down to 0.

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:00.010
How about the square
root of negative 1?

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.020
We've gone from numbers that
you know and love to

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:06.090
fractions, OK, to irrational.

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:07.280
This is irrational numbers.

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:10.530
Now we've gone into what they
call complex, or some people

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.430
call imaginary, which is
a terrible name for it.

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:15.390
OK, so what can you do to
this one here to try and

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:16.290
get it down to 0?

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.905
BRADY HARAN: Well, I'm just
going to square it and add 1.

00:03:18.905 --> 00:03:20.140
SIMON PAMPENA: There you go.

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:21.870
No flies on you, mate.

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:22.470
So there you go.

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:26.460
So we've been able to play this
game with three or four

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:29.090
very different types of numbers,
quite special.

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:30.170
But what about something else?

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:34.730
What about the square root of
2 plus the square root of 3?

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:36.510
What can you do with that?

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:37.480
So, let's see.

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:39.950
The square root of 2 plus
the square root of 3.

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:41.900
Now we're gonna square it.

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:44.630
OK, so this is a little bit
of high school maths.

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:49.140
2 plus 2 times this by this,
which is 2 the square root of

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:52.010
2 times square root of
3 plus this squared.

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:52.860
So that's 3.

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:56.440
So this reduces down to 5 plus
2 by the square root of 2 by

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:57.570
the square root of 3.

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:59.030
OK, so this is what
we've done.

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:01.830
We've done that there, but
look what's popped out.

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:03.440
A number that we can use,
a whole number.

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:06.490
So what we'll do is on this
side, we'll go 5 plus 2 by the

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:08.160
square root of 2 by the square
root of 3, and now

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:09.970
we'll take away 5.

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:12.650
So we'll end up getting 2 by
the square root of 2 by the

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:13.470
square root of 3.

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:15.560
And this is good, because
there's no

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:17.060
plus sign in the middle.

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:18.079
What can we do next?

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:20.339
Well, we're going to
square all of that.

00:04:20.339 --> 00:04:25.400
So 2 squared is 4, and the
square root of 2 squared is 2.

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:28.590
And the square root
of 3 squared is 3.

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:31.040
OK, so that dot is another
way of saying times.

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:33.660
And so that one is 2/8,
two 4's are eight,

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:35.980
eight 3's 24, done.

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:41.010
So if we go 24, take 24,
boom, we get down to 0.

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:42.650
What I wanted to show you, the
reason why I wanted to show

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:44.770
you this is because all these
different numbers look very

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:47.880
complicated, unrelated,
but let me show you.

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:51.342
Now, let's replace all the
numbers we put in with x.

00:04:51.342 --> 00:04:59.710
x take 10 is 0, 4x take 3 is
0, x squared take 2 is 0, x

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:04.690
squared plus 1 is 0, and this
one is x squared take 5, all

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:08.350
squared, take 24 equals
0, which if we

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:11.220
expand out, so look.

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:15.340
These all look like
algebra problems.

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:18.360
So what we did was in our game,
we picked numbers, and

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:19.380
we tried to get them to 0.

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:24.090
But the opposite could have been
here, let's solve for x.

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:26.510
Now, this is the stuff that
you get taught in school.

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:31.380
This is algebra, and it so
happens that the family that

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:34.380
all these numbers belong to,
even the square root of

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:38.190
negative 1, is algebraic
numbers.

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:41.920
So we've actually found a home
for some of the biggest stars

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:45.310
of maths, the numbers that have
caused huge problems and

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:47.600
schisms, what is the square
root of negative 1?

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:49.670
Square root of 2 from
the ancient times,

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:50.880
the Pythagorean times.

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:53.070
People died because
of this number.

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:55.790
But somehow we've found a family
for these numbers,

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:57.150
algebraic numbers.

00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:58.190
OK.

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:01.690
So next, we're going to need
another sheet of paper.

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:03.770
We've chosen some numbers.

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:05.700
What about a special number?

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:07.840
What about e?

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:09.520
Now this number here--

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:11.770
if you're not familiar with
it-- this number is a

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:13.570
fantastic number for maths.

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:17.643
And what it is is that if it's a
function, a function of e to

00:06:17.643 --> 00:06:20.940
the x, e to any number that
you raise it to, OK?

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:25.790
On the graph, when you graph
it like so, the y value is

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:28.400
also at the slope of the
tangent at that point.

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:30.590
So it's really, really important
to natural growth.

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:32.250
It's like a really
fantastic number.

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:34.460
It means a lot to life, really,
but it's actually a

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:36.000
super crazy number.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.650
Super, super crazy.

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:40.590
One of the expressions I can
show you for it is actually an

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:41.490
infinite sum.

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:43.160
So I'm going to blow you away.

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:52.370
It's 1 plus 1 on 1 plus 1 on 2
plus 1 on 6 plus 1 on 20--

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:53.720
anyway, it keeps going
forever and ever.

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:55.980
But can we play the game
with this number?

00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:59.500
Can we bring this number
down to 0 using the

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:01.220
rules of our game?

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:02.550
BRADY HARAN: Can we do
it with algebra?

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:04.130
SIMON PAMPENA: Can we
do it with algebra?

00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:04.400
That's right.

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:05.740
BRADY HARAN: All right.

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:06.460
Can we?

00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:09.070
SIMON PAMPENA: Well, for ages
and ages and ages, e's been

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:10.490
around for about 400 years.

00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:11.490
Nobody really knew.

00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:12.870
I mean, this number
is really, really

00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:14.910
important, and no one knew.

00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:17.490
It so happens, we can't.

00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:18.810
BRADY HARAN: It can't be done.

00:07:18.810 --> 00:07:20.960
SIMON PAMPENA: It can't be done,
and I'll show you why.

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:22.730
Well, I'll kind of try and show
you why, because it's

00:07:22.730 --> 00:07:24.175
actually really tricky.

00:07:24.175 --> 00:07:28.420
But it was a guy called Charles
Hermite, and he

00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:29.590
basically showed--

00:07:29.590 --> 00:07:31.900
right, so I'm going to use these
symbols here, because I

00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:34.390
don't know what the
formula will be.

00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:37.140
He basically showed if you try
and play the game, right,

00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:40.520
bringing e to any power that
you want, whole power and

00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:42.390
timesing it by any
whole number.

00:07:42.390 --> 00:07:46.700
So if you claim that there does
exist some bit of algebra

00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:49.410
that you can bring it down to 0,
he showed that you'll lead

00:07:49.410 --> 00:07:50.340
to a contradiction.

00:07:50.340 --> 00:07:53.560
Basically, he showed that there
was a number, a whole

00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:55.680
number that existed
between 0 and 1.

00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:58.420
Obviously, there's not.

00:07:58.420 --> 00:07:59.540
Obviously, there's not.

00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:02.490
But this is what you do in
maths, is that if you want to

00:08:02.490 --> 00:08:06.880
show you something is
impossible, you kind of assume

00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:09.250
that it's true, and then you
show that it creates a

00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:10.630
contradiction.

00:08:10.630 --> 00:08:11.730
So this is amazing.

00:08:11.730 --> 00:08:14.840
So this is what Hermite
discovered, and this is

00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:16.420
really, really a fantastic--

00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:21.350
I mean, everyone should be
excited by this, because e is

00:08:21.350 --> 00:08:24.090
not algebraic.

00:08:24.090 --> 00:08:26.180
So what number is it?

00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:29.050
Well, it somehow transcends what
we're capable of doing.

00:08:29.050 --> 00:08:31.880
The thing with algebra is that's
how we build numbers.

00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:34.669
Like, that's our world is
built with algebra.

00:08:34.669 --> 00:08:38.150
Like, any number that you kind
of deal with in your everyday

00:08:38.150 --> 00:08:39.815
life has a lot to
do with algebra.

00:08:39.815 --> 00:08:43.470
You're just adding, taking,
dividing, things to the power,

00:08:43.470 --> 00:08:44.760
but e is not.

00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:47.390
So it somehow transcends
maths.

00:08:47.390 --> 00:08:50.660
So that's what they called
it. e is transcendental.

00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:57.350
It's actually [INAUDIBLE]

00:08:57.350 --> 00:08:58.430
show you other than e.

00:08:58.430 --> 00:09:00.400
You know why, is because--

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:02.280
well, this is the interesting
thing.

00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:05.080
e wasn't the first
transcendental number.

00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:07.010
They discovered a transcendental
number,

00:09:07.010 --> 00:09:09.690
Liouville, I think his
name is, discovered a

00:09:09.690 --> 00:09:14.310
transcendental number quite a
long way before this, 30 years

00:09:14.310 --> 00:09:15.330
before this.

00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:16.760
But it was like, through
construction.

00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:19.270
So he was actually trying to
find a number based on the

00:09:19.270 --> 00:09:21.580
rules of the game
that didn't fit.

00:09:21.580 --> 00:09:24.330
What's special is that e was
already, it's already a

00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:25.935
superstar of maths, e.

00:09:25.935 --> 00:09:27.480
Like, people knew about it.

00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:30.410
So this was an extra piece
of information.

00:09:30.410 --> 00:09:32.545
But then people asked
this question.

00:09:32.545 --> 00:09:33.630
What about pi?

00:09:33.630 --> 00:09:34.820
BRADY HARAN: Superstar.

00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:36.100
SIMON PAMPENA: The superstar.

00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:37.950
This is the superstar of math.

00:09:37.950 --> 00:09:39.610
2,000 years old.

00:09:39.610 --> 00:09:40.580
What is pi?

00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:42.950
Is pi algebraic or
transcendental?

00:09:42.950 --> 00:09:45.090
So you've got to imagine
as a mathematician,

00:09:45.090 --> 00:09:46.760
OK, you love pi.

00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:48.260
Like, it comes with
the territory.

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:51.030
You cannot not like pi.

00:09:51.030 --> 00:09:53.260
So this is the thing, is that
you could actually add to the

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:54.680
knowledge of pi.

00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:57.500
You could add something new,
which is incredible.

00:09:57.500 --> 00:10:00.990
I mean, I would die a happy
man if I could do that.

00:10:00.990 --> 00:10:03.170
So this question came
up, what is pi?

00:10:03.170 --> 00:10:04.950
Is it algebraic or
transcendental?

00:10:04.950 --> 00:10:09.780
And so it was about, probably
1880s that a guy called

00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:12.410
Lindemann actually came
up with the answer.

00:10:12.410 --> 00:10:15.070
He showed, and again, this is
a very tricky thing that he

00:10:15.070 --> 00:10:21.300
showed, he showed e raised to
any algebraic number is

00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:22.400
transcendental.

00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:25.090
So for example, e to the 1, e.

00:10:25.090 --> 00:10:27.530
That's a good thing, because
e should be transcendental,

00:10:27.530 --> 00:10:29.040
because it's already
been proven.

00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:30.580
Because 1 is algebraic.

00:10:30.580 --> 00:10:33.310
Your favorite number,
Brady, e to the 10.

00:10:33.310 --> 00:10:35.270
That's transcendental, right?

00:10:35.270 --> 00:10:38.030
e to the square root
of 2, e to the i.

00:10:38.030 --> 00:10:39.530
Right?

00:10:39.530 --> 00:10:42.400
What about pi?

00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:46.090
So how could you use this fact
here, e to the a, so a is any

00:10:46.090 --> 00:10:47.130
algebraic number, is
transcendental?

00:10:47.130 --> 00:10:49.670
How can you use that fact
to show that pi is

00:10:49.670 --> 00:10:50.290
transcendental?

00:10:50.290 --> 00:10:51.950
OK, so this is the thing.

00:10:51.950 --> 00:10:54.720
Again, it's a proof
by contradiction.

00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:57.070
So, this is what he did.

00:10:57.070 --> 00:11:01.620
He said, let's assume
pi is algebraic.

00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:02.370
So pi is algebraic.

00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:04.180
That means there's
a formula for it.

00:11:04.180 --> 00:11:05.830
OK, what's that formula?

00:11:05.830 --> 00:11:07.230
Who knows?

00:11:07.230 --> 00:11:08.540
Because it doesn't exist.

00:11:08.540 --> 00:11:11.060
But as an example, if you're
an engineer, you'd say, oh,

00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:12.790
yeah, pi, 22 on 7.

00:11:12.790 --> 00:11:13.640
All right?

00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:14.370
OK, cool.

00:11:14.370 --> 00:11:20.020
So that means pi times
7 take 22 equals 0.

00:11:20.020 --> 00:11:20.780
Right?

00:11:20.780 --> 00:11:21.470
As an example.

00:11:21.470 --> 00:11:22.780
That's not true, by the way.

00:11:22.780 --> 00:11:24.170
There's no way I'm claiming
that to be true.

00:11:24.170 --> 00:11:26.290
Don't you dare cut it and say
Simon thinks that's true.

00:11:26.290 --> 00:11:26.790
It's not true.

00:11:26.790 --> 00:11:28.140
Pi, 22 on 7.

00:11:28.140 --> 00:11:29.760
Pi, 22 on 7.

00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:31.820
I know pi to quite a few decimal
places, and that's

00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:32.720
obviously not true.

00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:35.740
And an actual fact, just so I
can tell you, another really

00:11:35.740 --> 00:11:40.020
nice approximation of pi
is the cube root of 31.

00:11:40.020 --> 00:11:41.130
It's actually pretty close.

00:11:41.130 --> 00:11:43.680
So that could be another
formula.

00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:46.440
So that means if we cube
that and take away

00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:49.450
31, that equals 0.

00:11:49.450 --> 00:11:52.130
OK, so we've got like these
phony equations.

00:11:52.130 --> 00:11:53.670
This is the big kicker.

00:11:53.670 --> 00:11:55.370
This is the big kicker.

00:11:55.370 --> 00:12:00.430
We're going to use another
superstar equation, OK?

00:12:00.430 --> 00:12:04.650
e to the i pi equals
negative 1.

00:12:04.650 --> 00:12:07.820
So this is Euler's identity.

00:12:07.820 --> 00:12:09.370
It's a famous one, isn't it?

00:12:09.370 --> 00:12:10.030
But look at it.

00:12:10.030 --> 00:12:15.130
Look what it says. e raised
to the i pi is negative 1.

00:12:15.130 --> 00:12:20.930
Now, i pi, OK, if we assume pi
is algebraic, that means i pi

00:12:20.930 --> 00:12:22.580
must be algebraic.

00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:26.530
So e to an algebraic number
has to be transcendental.

00:12:26.530 --> 00:12:29.840
But is negative 1
transcendental?

00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:31.520
It's not, because we can
play the game, and we

00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:33.240
can get it to 0.

00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:38.340
So by using another increase
piece of maths in your

00:12:38.340 --> 00:12:40.890
formula, imagine this is like
you're making a film, like

00:12:40.890 --> 00:12:43.240
you're doing a maths film, and
you've just got the biggest

00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:46.340
Hollywood star in the world
to start in it.

00:12:46.340 --> 00:12:47.440
In your proof.

00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:48.950
Starring in your proof.

00:12:48.950 --> 00:12:51.340
So this here, e to the
i pi is negative 1.

00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:54.560
If indeed this was algebraic,
this would have to be

00:12:54.560 --> 00:13:01.270
transcendental, so that means
i pi cannot be algebraic.

00:13:01.270 --> 00:13:02.270
And who's the culprit?

00:13:02.270 --> 00:13:04.850
Well, it's not the square
root of negative 1.

00:13:04.850 --> 00:13:05.980
It's pi.

00:13:05.980 --> 00:13:12.870
So pi cannot be algebraic,
which means pi must be

00:13:12.870 --> 00:13:14.120
transcendental.

00:13:19.850 --> 00:13:24.100
So there's something really
tricky going on, and that's

00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:24.820
why I like it.

00:13:24.820 --> 00:13:27.160
Because the tricky stuff
is where all the

00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:28.360
awesome maths is.

00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:31.010
In maths, perfection
is important.

00:13:31.010 --> 00:13:33.220
But then, anyone who
uses maths--

00:13:33.220 --> 00:13:36.560
for physics or chemistry, or
whatever you want to do--

00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:38.380
then they can kind of
use approximations.

00:13:38.380 --> 00:13:39.630
I'm not interested in
approximations.
