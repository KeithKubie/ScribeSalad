00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
And the answer is that F = MA.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
So, we have it. the equation of Newtonian physics.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Force times acceleration--what a beautiful equation.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
It says that the cause of acceleration is force.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
When I apply a force to a mass, I get acceleration.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:25.000
This one equation when properly applied can be used to derive almost all of Newtonian physics.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
So, congratulations.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Now that you have this equation, you're done. You might as well stop.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
If you can do all these things, what's left to learn. See you in the next class, I guess.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
But that's not entirely true,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
because even though this equation is underlying all of these things,

00:00:38.000 --> 99:59:59.000
we still need to know how to use it.
