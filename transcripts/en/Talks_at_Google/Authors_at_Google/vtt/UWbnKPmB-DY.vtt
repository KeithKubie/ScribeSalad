00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:01.750
&gt;&gt;Ben Fried: Hi, Iím Ben Fried.

00:00:01.750 --> 00:00:02.750
Iím Googleís CIO.

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:09.679
And Iím here with Ed Yourden to talk about
his new book, or newish book, CIOs at Work.

00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:10.679
CIOs at Work, there.

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:11.679
See, whereís the camera?

00:00:11.679 --> 00:00:14.459
&gt;&gt;Ed Yourden: Not at play, just at work.

00:00:14.459 --> 00:00:16.430
&gt;&gt;Ben Fried: Yeah, that would be a much shorter
book.

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:17.430
[Laughter]

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.901
&gt;&gt;Ben Fried: So, anyway, a little bit about
Ed for those of you, who might not know, might

00:00:20.901 --> 00:00:21.901
not have heard about him.

00:00:21.901 --> 00:00:26.330
Ed has been in the computing industry for
over 40 years.

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:30.070
Author of
dozens, over two dozen books, many, many,

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:33.450
many articles, is a consultant, expert witness.

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:41.650
Heís written, I think, kind of books that
iconically identify elements of the last 20

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:42.850
years
in technology.

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:46.899
Iím thinking of titles like, Death March,
Decline and Fall of the American

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:49.819
Programmer, Rise and Resurrection of the American
Programmer.

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:53.711
As well as the work he did in
the '70s on structure analysis and the work

00:00:53.711 --> 00:00:58.260
on object oriented analysis and design that
followed in the decades afterwards.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:05.750
As I said, the most recent book is CIOs at
Work which is

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:11.160
interviews with sixteen CIOs from kind of
all walks of industry and organization.

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:16.580
Private
companies, governmental organizations and

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:20.110
many, many, many industries, thereís the
CIOs,

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:24.050
some of them include the CIOs of American
Airlines, Microsoft, NASA, Verizon, University

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:27.860
of
Miami, The Educational Testing Service.

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:30.860
I would have some prime questions for the
CIO of the

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:33.160
place that does the SATs, but thatís a different
matter.

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:34.160
[Laughter]

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:40.470
&gt;&gt;Ben Fried: And, you know, perhaps not least
the CIO of Google is also one of the interviews.

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:46.050
Anyways, a fascinating read, a very quick
read, I recommend it.

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:49.540
So letís, some kind of
background questions on the book.

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:53.590
How long were you working on this and what
inspired you,

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:57.650
what was kind of the objective that you had
for the book?

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:00.620
&gt;&gt;Ed Yourden: Well, it went fairly quickly.

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:02.450
The interviews themselves were only about
an

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:07.340
hour long and they were spaced out over probably
six months.

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.120
The most time consuming part
turned out to be the just the turnaround of

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.120
getting things edited and getting various
CIOs

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:15.569
to own up to what they had said.

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:16.569
You know, Oh my God!

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:17.569
[Laughter]

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:21.220
&gt;&gt;Ed Yourden: I have to take responsibility
for this.

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:25.670
But the reason I wrote the book was
twofold.

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:32.530
I wanted to provide some more attention and
awareness and respect for this

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:35.980
particular role that we now see everywhere.

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:38.630
I donít think youíre lacking any respect
necessarily.

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:40.060
But there are a lot of ñ.

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:41.280
&gt;&gt;Ben Fried: Oh, I do.

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:42.280
[Laughter]

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:43.280
&gt;&gt;Ed Yourden: Well thatís your problem.

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:44.280
[Laughs]

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:49.630
&gt;&gt;Ed Yourden: But there are a lot of CIOs
who I donít think are getting enough respect

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:52.720
and
thatís because even though we all know we

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:55.220
live in the information age the culture in
a lot

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:59.950
of companies is still based on how that particular
company got started a hundred years

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:00.950
earlier.

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:04.731
You know, weíve always made widgets, weíre
in the widget business, we praise and

00:03:04.731 --> 00:03:07.890
respect widget makers and then we got some
computers over here.

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:10.150
Because the widgets used to
be just bare metal but now theyíve got a

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:12.500
couple of computers in them and somebody has
to

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:15.220
look after that.

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:20.520
I was curious to see what role the CIOs actually
were playing in a lot of

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:25.569
these companies, beyond just keeping the lights
on, you know, running the networks and the

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:27.819
data centers and so on.

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:31.800
And it was very interesting to see how CIOs
are trying to help their

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:36.230
companies become more profitable doing whatever
they are doing as well as looking for

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:40.310
completely new opportunities in areas theyíre
not doing at all right now.

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:44.989
&gt;&gt;Ben Fried: So one of the things Iím really
excited about the opportunity to interview

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:49.010
you
is, unlike some of your previous works, yours

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:51.380
is a much quieter voice in the sense that
youíre

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:56.120
attempting, your voice as the interviewer
as opposed to add a commentary, and a commentary

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:01.900
sometimes does come out in the form of questions
and the way you direct the dialogue.

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:06.030
But
itís certainly the voice of the opinions

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:07.800
of the people you interviewed far more so
then

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:08.800
yours.

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:12.080
So Iím really interested in taking this opportunity
now to learn a little bit about

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:17.470
what you concluded or kind of the opinions
that maybe you donít share that are actually

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:18.470
in
the book.

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:23.620
And I guess the first one I have, along those
lines, is how similar or different

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:27.900
is the role of the CIO across all of these
tremendously diverse organizations?

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:33.560
&gt;&gt;Ed Yourden: Well, it is relatively similar,
I think.

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:37.431
Of course, there is a great deal of
diversity in the organizations, particularly

00:04:37.431 --> 00:04:41.500
between the public sector organizations and
private sector.

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:45.350
I interviewed the CIO of the United States,
which is kind of cool, as well

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:47.410
as the CIO of the British Parliament.

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:49.140
And thereís an organization thatís a thousand
years

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:54.850
old that still has data written on scrolls
of parchment that they have to maintain.

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:58.930
But,
within the private sector, as I was saying

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:03.020
a moment ago, most CIOs have the common role
of

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:09.940
just running the operation, the computers
out of the operation.

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:15.860
But in terms of helping
their companies figure out where their new

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:22.830
areas of business might be located, that was
quite different from one company to another.

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:27.030
Some companies I got the sense that they
werenít really involved in that at all.

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:29.880
And in most companies they were so heavily
focused

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:35.930
on helping the business unit managers do a
more effective or more efficient or more

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:38.800
competitive job at businesses they were already
in.

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:44.710
&gt;&gt;Ben Fried: Now are the differences in these
IT organizations and CIO roles and functions

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:48.560
of the organization age or culture or industry?

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:55.810
&gt;&gt;Ed Yourden: To me it was more age and size
than anything else.

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:59.600
I mean, obviously thereís
some difference between companies like you

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:03.150
guys that are doing nothing but information
or

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:07.949
other computer companies versus the widget
manufacturers of the world, the auto companies

00:06:07.949 --> 00:06:10.370
or what not.

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:15.390
But thereís, I think, a profound difference
between a company, well, order of

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:20.120
magnitude like you guys being ten years old
with ten thousand employees versus a company

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:24.010
thatís a hundred years old with a hundred
thousand employees.

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:28.340
Just an enormous difference
and you see that reflected on several different

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:29.340
levels.

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:34.470
It means the CIO, someone like your age
is likely to be someone in their 60s and who

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:40.300
vividly remembers what it was like 40 or 50
years ago.

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:46.940
&gt;&gt;Ben Fried: So I guess given such diversity
and differences in age companies, is there

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:50.180
some kind of conventional path for these people
that they follow to have gotten into the

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:51.620
seat that theyíre in?

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:55.240
&gt;&gt;Ed Yourden: It turns out not, indeed, one
of the surprises I got, one of the things

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:58.240
I
didnít expect is at least when they talked

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:00.080
to me, knowing that they were gonna be on
the

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:04.580
record, virtually all of these people said
they had no aspiration to become a CIO when

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:06.800
they
started nor did they have any idea what they

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:09.590
were gonna do if and when that role ever ended.

00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:16.350
I mean, clearly all of them had moved into
some kind of management oriented path.

00:07:16.350 --> 00:07:20.190
They may have started off, indeed some of
them did, many of them did start off as technicians.

00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:25.320
And there were a few, including, for example,
the CIO of the New York stock exchange with

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:26.699
a PhD.

00:07:26.699 --> 00:07:32.380
Not necessarily in computer science but people
with a really strong technical education and

00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:36.660
a strong technical beginning to their career
for whatever reason moved into management

00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:39.490
and they just went from one step to the next.

00:07:39.490 --> 00:07:44.340
But they all said that that was not part of
their plan starting out.

00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:50.050
Nor did they have any strong advice in terms
of education or preparation for those that

00:07:50.050 --> 00:07:51.440
might aspire to be a CIO.

00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:57.169
You know, I said, ìIs it really important
to get an MBA?î Generally they all said no.

00:07:57.169 --> 00:08:02.180
Is it really important to have a technical,
a computer science degree or double E or something

00:08:02.180 --> 00:08:03.310
like that?

00:08:03.310 --> 00:08:06.210
And I got a lot of wishy washy answers, not
a lot of--.

00:08:06.210 --> 00:08:11.289
&gt;&gt;Ben Fried: One of the surprising things
that I saw was that Tony Scott, the CIO of

00:08:11.289 --> 00:08:15.180
Microsoft, previously of Disney and CTO of
General Motors, or maybe divisional CTO of

00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:19.910
General Motors, Iím not really sure and so
on, his degree is in parks and recreation.

00:08:19.910 --> 00:08:20.960
&gt;&gt;Ed Yourden: Yes.

00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:21.960
Yes.

00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:22.960
[Laughter]

00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:23.960
&gt;&gt;Ed Yourden: Not from the TV show but

00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:24.960
[Laughter]

00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:28.880
&gt;&gt;Ed Yourden: It turned out, as was often
true back in the 70ís, is that people in

00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:35.880
a variety of the most unlikely sorts of jobs
and industries and professions stumbled into

00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:37.200
computers, one way or another.

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:42.250
And, often, they were the only ones in the
entire organization so they became the star,

00:08:42.250 --> 00:08:45.940
the wizard and that launched their career.

00:08:45.940 --> 00:08:49.850
Most of them did say to me that they had also
found a mentor.

00:08:49.850 --> 00:08:57.770
Usually unwittingly or even unknowingly but
somebody who really set them on the path that

00:08:57.770 --> 00:08:59.630
ultimately led them to a CIO position.

00:08:59.630 --> 00:09:04.980
&gt;&gt;Ben Fried: So you talked about kind of the
surprises that you encountered in the book,

00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:06.160
in
researching the book.

00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:10.670
What were the other surprises, the unexpected,
that came out through

00:09:10.670 --> 00:09:11.670
the interviews?

00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:17.070
&gt;&gt;Ed Yourden: The main one was this idea that
they had no idea where they were likely to

00:09:17.070 --> 00:09:19.529
go,
and I was surprised that none of them, at

00:09:19.529 --> 00:09:21.660
least admitted to me, that they wanted to
be a

00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:22.670
CEO.

00:09:22.670 --> 00:09:26.630
It might seem to be the next logical step.

00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:31.460
And that none of them had started off with
that role in mind that they had just kind

00:09:31.460 --> 00:09:33.810
of fallen into the job.

00:09:33.810 --> 00:09:38.000
Iím sure that there were
some other surprises that will come to me

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.640
probably as we continue talking but that was
one

00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:42.150
that really occurred to me the most.

00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:50.230
&gt;&gt;Ben Fried: What were the, I guess the, so
it sounds like youíre saying that the biggest

00:09:50.230 --> 00:09:56.080
thing the CIOs have in common is this operational
responsibility, is that true?

00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:59.681
I was kind
of wondering where, you know, if you had a

00:09:59.681 --> 00:10:03.120
cocktail party with all these people, brought
all

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:06.570
the CIOs together, what would they all kind
of converge on as things that they had in

00:10:06.570 --> 00:10:07.640
common?

00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:13.060
&gt;&gt;Ed Yourden: They all have in common this
operational responsibility but I donít wanna

00:10:13.060 --> 00:10:17.010
say
they take it for granted, but they just assume

00:10:17.010 --> 00:10:20.560
thatís done, thatís okay.

00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:23.670
Curiously, now
that youíve started raising these questions,

00:10:23.670 --> 00:10:25.700
I was expecting a lot more of them to say
we

00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:30.300
have an enormously difficult job getting our
projects finished on time.

00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:36.019
Which is an
operational responsibility and itís been

00:10:36.019 --> 00:10:40.420
the central part of my career, you know, helping
people figure out how to get systems built

00:10:40.420 --> 00:10:42.950
on time that actually do the right job.

00:10:42.950 --> 00:10:45.180
None of
them admitted to any difficulties there.

00:10:45.180 --> 00:10:48.760
They seemed to feel that they had that under
control.

00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:53.140
They all worried about security, in terms
of conversions.

00:10:53.140 --> 00:10:55.990
If I got a bunch of
these people in a cocktail party and said

00:10:55.990 --> 00:10:57.490
whatís the thing that keeps you awake at
night,

00:10:57.490 --> 00:11:01.620
and I asked you this question too, every single
one of them said security, followed

00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:05.710
immediately by the statement that they had
the best security people in the world.

00:11:05.710 --> 00:11:06.710
[Laughter]

00:11:06.710 --> 00:11:08.870
&gt;&gt;Ed Yourden: Which I thought was rather amusing.

00:11:08.870 --> 00:11:16.390
But none of them seemed to think or at
least admit that security at times could put

00:11:16.390 --> 00:11:18.040
them out of business permanently.

00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:21.590
They all
certainly said it could cost us a lot of money,

00:11:21.590 --> 00:11:28.040
it could disrupt our business, it could do
various bad things but what they worry about

00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:30.779
at night in the privacy of their own home
might be different.

00:11:30.779 --> 00:11:36.120
But in any case, security was the single area
of convergence.

00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:41.580
&gt;&gt;Ben Fried: Now, on the subject of this cocktail
party, Iíve hypothesized that it might

00:11:41.580 --> 00:11:45.870
actually not be such a spectacular event because
I think a lot of people tend to think of

00:11:45.870 --> 00:11:52.300
IT and us CIOs as being cautious, conservative,
slow moving, ergo not such a successful

00:11:52.300 --> 00:11:55.640
cocktail party, perhaps.

00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:58.610
First of all, have you observed that to be
true in these

00:11:58.610 --> 00:11:59.610
conversations?

00:11:59.610 --> 00:12:02.060
And secondly, why do you think that is?

00:12:02.060 --> 00:12:05.471
&gt;&gt;Ed Yourden: Well, I think it is true and
I think there are two main reasons for it.

00:12:05.471 --> 00:12:09.850
One is the corporate reason and the other
is the personal reason.

00:12:09.850 --> 00:12:14.560
As I was saying a little bit earlier, thereís
a profound difference between a company thatís

00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:19.370
a hundred years old, thatís been building
widgets for a hundred years and has a legacy

00:12:19.370 --> 00:12:20.450
and has a culture.

00:12:20.450 --> 00:12:25.360
I mean, you have to ask yourself, for example,
why is it that Kodak could not have created

00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:29.680
Instagram and instead was visibly going bankrupt
at that very moment?

00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:32.490
Thatís even more important for me

00:12:32.490 --> 00:12:33.490
[Clears throat]

00:12:33.490 --> 00:12:37.220
&gt;&gt;Ed Yourden: personally because I happen
to know, personally, that in the early to

00:12:37.220 --> 00:12:41.430
mid 80s
a new CEO came into Kodak and said, ìWeíre

00:12:41.430 --> 00:12:44.580
now in the information age, digital is gonna
be

00:12:44.580 --> 00:12:49.529
important.î Kodak, by the way also invented
the digital camera and the Kodak culture said,

00:12:49.529 --> 00:12:50.590
ìOh my gosh, what are we gonna do?

00:12:50.590 --> 00:12:53.360
We better go buy some computer companies because
we donít

00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:57.180
know anything about this.î And they bought
my company, which is why I know about all

00:12:57.180 --> 00:12:58.180
this.

00:12:58.180 --> 00:13:00.370
A year
later the CEO was gone, he was running Ross

00:13:00.370 --> 00:13:02.649
Perotís presidential campaign which was
interesting.

00:13:02.649 --> 00:13:03.649
[Laughter]

00:13:03.649 --> 00:13:07.610
&gt;&gt;Ed Yourden: And then the Kodak culture said,
ìWhy do we have these computer companies?î

00:13:07.610 --> 00:13:10.880
And they sold us off and went back to making
little yellow boxes.

00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:14.620
And, you know, they could
not change their culture.

00:13:14.620 --> 00:13:20.280
And I think thatís one reason that the CIO
is immersed in the

00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:24.140
culture that finds it incredibly difficult
to change.

00:13:24.140 --> 00:13:29.240
And you guys may feel that that
doesnít affect you right now and I get the

00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:32.990
impression that some folks at Google are
beginning to talk about and worry about it,

00:13:32.990 --> 00:13:36.890
but youíre only 10 or 12 years old, you know,
when youíre 50 or 100 years old itís really

00:13:36.890 --> 00:13:38.120
a profound thing.

00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:43.910
And on a personal level, for
the bigger, older companies, youíre talking

00:13:43.910 --> 00:13:45.640
about people that have reached the pinnacle
of

00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:49.149
their career after 40 or 50 years.

00:13:49.149 --> 00:13:51.630
So theyíre used to rising up through the
organizational

00:13:51.630 --> 00:13:58.670
hierarchy, there used to the political games
and theyíre used to being visible.

00:13:58.670 --> 00:14:03.160
Theyíre
also used to about a decade of experience

00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:06.180
where the life expectancy of a CIO is 18 months.

00:14:06.180 --> 00:14:07.180
[Laughter]

00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:09.380
&gt;&gt;Ed Yourden: So theyíre very cautious and
very conservative.

00:14:09.380 --> 00:14:15.070
Theyíre also very accustomed,
they have been until very recently when companies

00:14:15.070 --> 00:14:19.050
like Google began turning things upside
down, theyíre used to having the vendors

00:14:19.050 --> 00:14:21.930
coming in and telling them whatís in the
technology

00:14:21.930 --> 00:14:26.180
pipeline, whatís coming along, whenís the
next mainframe gonna appear?

00:14:26.180 --> 00:14:29.180
Theyíre used to be
consulting firms like Accenture and McKinsey

00:14:29.180 --> 00:14:32.820
coming in to lay out their wisdom.

00:14:32.820 --> 00:14:34.639
So that
just tends to make them very cautious and

00:14:34.639 --> 00:14:35.910
conservative, I think.

00:14:35.910 --> 00:14:39.630
&gt;&gt;Ben Fried: Yeah, I mean, the next question
that I have is one that I struggle with a

00:14:39.630 --> 00:14:40.630
lot.

00:14:40.630 --> 00:14:44.899
I donít know if youíre a fan of old comic
books, in the first issue of detective comics,

00:14:44.899 --> 00:14:46.730
Bruce Wayne has decided to become a super
hero

00:14:46.730 --> 00:14:47.730
[Laughter]

00:14:47.730 --> 00:14:51.700
&gt;&gt;Ben Fried: And heís sitting under a window
contemplating what his approach to crime

00:14:51.700 --> 00:14:56.519
fighting will be and a bat flies through the
enormous gothic window of his, of Wayne mansion.

00:14:56.519 --> 00:14:57.570
And he says, ìThatís it.

00:14:57.570 --> 00:15:00.480
Iíll take the form of a bat.î He says something
like, ìCriminals

00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:05.240
are a cowardly, superstitious lot and Iíll
strike fear into their hearts.î Iíve always

00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:09.389
thought that phrase, not always, but Iíve
come to realize that maybe that phrase, ìCriminals

00:15:09.389 --> 00:15:12.820
are a cowardly, superstitious lot,î could
also be applied to CIOs.

00:15:12.820 --> 00:15:13.820
[Laughter]

00:15:13.820 --> 00:15:19.290
&gt;&gt;Ben Fried: Whether thatís a deep comment
on my own psyche or not, Iíll leave it to

00:15:19.290 --> 00:15:20.579
the
audience to determine.

00:15:20.579 --> 00:15:21.579
[Laughter]

00:15:21.579 --> 00:15:26.240
&gt;&gt;Ben Fried: I think the kind of existential
question that I actually have is, you know,

00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:29.660
technology is such a fundamental source of
disruption, right?

00:15:29.660 --> 00:15:32.130
Computer information
technology is such a fundamental source of

00:15:32.130 --> 00:15:33.130
disruption.

00:15:33.130 --> 00:15:38.140
Is it possible for the CIO to
actually be the agent of that disruption?

00:15:38.140 --> 00:15:44.480
Or are they fundamentally a force of moderation
in that disruption?

00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:47.061
One of the things that you mention in the
book is that BYOD, bring

00:15:47.061 --> 00:15:51.200
your own device, IPads coming into the workforce
has been kind of one of the big sea

00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:53.300
changes, several people talk about it.

00:15:53.300 --> 00:15:55.959
Vivek Kundra and others kind of talk about
it and the

00:15:55.959 --> 00:15:56.959
importance of that.

00:15:56.959 --> 00:15:58.699
But CIOs didnít create that.

00:15:58.699 --> 00:16:01.230
CIOs were forced to deal with that, right?

00:16:01.230 --> 00:16:08.459
So I guess the question is, is there this
existential dilemma which is taken on the

00:16:08.459 --> 00:16:12.970
form that
the tools which we ask CIOs to invest themselves

00:16:12.970 --> 00:16:16.220
in, they are fundamentally unable to
realize the full capability of, which is the

00:16:16.220 --> 00:16:19.019
maximal power to disrupt within their
organizations?

00:16:19.019 --> 00:16:20.840
&gt;&gt;Ed Yourden: Thatís probably true.

00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:22.610
That is probably true.

00:16:22.610 --> 00:16:28.880
Itís particularly interesting
with this BYOD and also social network phenomenon,

00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:32.660
part of what I was expecting when I
went through these interviews was the same

00:16:32.660 --> 00:16:35.020
uniform rejection that I had seen about four
or

00:16:35.020 --> 00:16:36.410
five years ago.

00:16:36.410 --> 00:16:41.139
Which sometimes seems like a lifetime but
itís not that far ago.

00:16:41.139 --> 00:16:42.139
[Laughs]

00:16:42.139 --> 00:16:45.880
&gt;&gt;Ed Yourden: If you talk to the average CIO
in 2007 or 8 he would say, ìItís a communist

00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:46.880
plot.î

00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:47.880
[Laughter]

00:16:47.880 --> 00:16:49.460
&gt;&gt;Ed Yourden: ìItís evil.

00:16:49.460 --> 00:16:54.029
Weíre gonna keep it outside the corporate
walls.î Blah, blah, blah.

00:16:54.029 --> 00:16:58.970
Two or three years ago, they were grudgingly
allowing some of this stuff to happen.

00:16:58.970 --> 00:17:01.710
But they
really werenít happy.

00:17:01.710 --> 00:17:05.149
And now, at least when you talk to them, they
give you the impression

00:17:05.149 --> 00:17:08.519
that theyíre on board and that theyíre in
favor of it and so on.

00:17:08.519 --> 00:17:12.859
But, as you say, they
certainly were not leading the charge.

00:17:12.859 --> 00:17:16.679
And part of that, I think, goes back to this
issue

00:17:16.679 --> 00:17:21.829
of a generation of CIOs that is as old as
I am and who remembers growing up in an era

00:17:21.829 --> 00:17:24.880
when
computers were scarce and expensive and had

00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:31.919
to be protected and controlled and where
anything that disrupted the status quo was

00:17:31.919 --> 00:17:35.409
just viewed with great terror.

00:17:35.409 --> 00:17:39.169
And I think you
had generations of technology-based companies

00:17:39.169 --> 00:17:42.309
that were rebellious and disruptive and so
on

00:17:42.309 --> 00:17:46.769
when they began but then after a couple of
decades, well, look at Microsoft.

00:17:46.769 --> 00:17:48.720
&gt;&gt;Ben Fried: They became established, right?

00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:50.460
They're part of the firmament.

00:17:50.460 --> 00:17:51.460
&gt;&gt;Ed Yourden: Yeah.

00:17:51.460 --> 00:17:53.869
And itís particularly ironic when you read
that Bill Gates spent

00:17:53.869 --> 00:18:00.279
enormous amounts of time studying how it was
that IBM and Deck had missed the next

00:18:00.279 --> 00:18:04.249
generation of tidal waves, what can you do
to prevent it.

00:18:04.249 --> 00:18:08.950
But now theyíve got a culture
that they will fight tooth and nail to protect

00:18:08.950 --> 00:18:10.109
and defend.

00:18:10.109 --> 00:18:14.729
&gt;&gt;Ben Fried: Thatís fascinating, the kind
of, the bureaucratic inertia is incredible,

00:18:14.729 --> 00:18:17.609
an
incredible force isnít it, inside these large

00:18:17.609 --> 00:18:18.609
organizations.

00:18:18.609 --> 00:18:23.090
&gt;&gt;Ed Yourden: And yet, there are some tidal
forces that they seem to be very much aware

00:18:23.090 --> 00:18:25.179
of
and very much behind.

00:18:25.179 --> 00:18:29.460
And I asked the typical CIO what they thought
was gonna be the

00:18:29.460 --> 00:18:31.700
important technology of the next few years.

00:18:31.700 --> 00:18:33.360
I mean, everyone said that mobile computing
is

00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:37.289
just getting started and will be far more
powerful and important than we can possibly

00:18:37.289 --> 00:18:44.239
imagine, everybody was in favor of cloud computing
and this is one that I think will also

00:18:44.239 --> 00:18:48.239
illustrate this generational difference, everyone
said Mooreís Law would continue

00:18:48.239 --> 00:18:49.340
indefinitely.

00:18:49.340 --> 00:18:52.570
Now, that probably doesnít mean anything
to you guys cause itís been true

00:18:52.570 --> 00:18:53.570
your entire lives.

00:18:53.570 --> 00:18:54.919
&gt;&gt;Ben Fried: Howís that gonna happen?

00:18:54.919 --> 00:18:56.330
We canít scale a clock frequency

00:18:56.330 --> 00:19:01.340
&gt;&gt;Ed Yourden: But hereís whatís important,
again, imagine a CIO who is in his mid 60ís

00:19:01.340 --> 00:19:04.240
like
me and who remember, I donít know if any

00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:07.759
of you remember when Mooreís Law was published,
when that paper was published.

00:19:07.759 --> 00:19:13.230
Itís a mere 47 years and 11 days ago on April
19th, 1965

00:19:13.230 --> 00:19:15.840
about a month before I graduated from college.

00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:19.479
Youíre welcome to look it up, thereís this
search engine that might be of some use to

00:19:19.479 --> 00:19:20.479
you

00:19:20.479 --> 00:19:21.479
[Laughter]

00:19:21.479 --> 00:19:24.759
&gt;&gt;Ed Yourden: But what you may not be aware
of is that when that paper was published,

00:19:24.759 --> 00:19:29.960
Gordon Moore said, ìI think this amazing
phenomenon is gonna continue for 10 years.î

00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:30.960
[Laughter]

00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:32.899
&gt;&gt;Ed Yourden: And so people of my generation
said, ìWow!

00:19:32.899 --> 00:19:37.779
That means weíre gonna have this
enormous run for 10 years, and then weíll

00:19:37.779 --> 00:19:39.889
coast the rest of our lives.î Well, 10 years
later

00:19:39.889 --> 00:19:43.951
Intel said, ìYou now what, it might actually
go on for another 10 years.î And then they

00:19:43.951 --> 00:19:46.119
said another 10
years and now, the latest estimate Iíve heard

00:19:46.119 --> 00:19:49.779
is itíll keep going on till 2026, by which
time I wonít

00:19:49.779 --> 00:19:50.989
care one way or another.

00:19:50.989 --> 00:19:51.989
[Laughter]

00:19:51.989 --> 00:19:57.610
&gt;&gt;Ed Yourden: But I think that a lot of todayís
CIOs are saying we donít know how itís

00:19:57.610 --> 00:20:04.059
gonna happen, we donít know whatís doing
it, weíre not inside Intel, we donít know

00:20:04.059 --> 00:20:05.779
the
basic technology thatís gonna make it happen

00:20:05.779 --> 00:20:10.099
but weíre taking it on faith that itíll
continue.

00:20:10.099 --> 00:20:13.539
Which is an interesting thing and one for
you guys to think about yourselves, is

00:20:13.539 --> 00:20:16.479
this something you should take for granted
the rest of your career?

00:20:16.479 --> 00:20:19.169
That every 18 months
computer power will double?

00:20:19.169 --> 00:20:22.159
What if that should stop being true someday,
then what?

00:20:22.159 --> 00:20:23.159
[Sigh]

00:20:23.159 --> 00:20:24.390
&gt;&gt;Ben Fried: Wow.

00:20:24.390 --> 00:20:25.390
[Laughter]

00:20:25.390 --> 00:20:27.799
&gt;&gt;Ed Yourden: Thereís a metaphysical question.

00:20:27.799 --> 00:20:28.799
&gt;&gt;Ben Fried: Yeah.

00:20:28.799 --> 00:20:31.599
Then all those algorithms become real important
when you canít just

00:20:31.599 --> 00:20:37.419
rely on faster clock speed and slower dies,
smaller dies, etcetera.

00:20:37.419 --> 00:20:43.529
So hereís an unknown
unknowns kind of question for you.

00:20:43.529 --> 00:20:46.269
What did you not here that surprised you?

00:20:46.269 --> 00:20:52.119
And whatís
not on CIOs minds that you think should be?

00:20:52.119 --> 00:21:01.409
&gt;&gt;Ed Yourden: I would say that the one that
occurred to me most was the importance of

00:21:01.409 --> 00:21:06.029
the,
your term, social contract.

00:21:06.029 --> 00:21:12.630
This notion that you actually have to do something
to make a

00:21:12.630 --> 00:21:18.559
place interesting and challenging and exciting
to work at, they still seem to take it for

00:21:18.559 --> 00:21:22.009
granted and just think itís gonna happen
and that they donít really have to do very

00:21:22.009 --> 00:21:24.879
much to
make it happen, so you donít even have to

00:21:24.879 --> 00:21:25.879
talk about it.

00:21:25.879 --> 00:21:29.669
Or if you ask them a couple of
questions, they rear back.

00:21:29.669 --> 00:21:32.009
One of the questions I asked several of the
CIOs is whether they

00:21:32.009 --> 00:21:38.479
heard of this phenomenon of groups of college
graduates applying for a job en masse.

00:21:38.479 --> 00:21:42.600
&gt;&gt;Ben Fried: As in we were a team in college,
we wanna be a team at our first employer.

00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:45.090
&gt;&gt;Ed Yourden: Itís either all of us or none
of us.

00:21:45.090 --> 00:21:46.090
&gt;&gt;Ben Fried: Yeah.

00:21:46.090 --> 00:21:49.519
&gt;&gt;Ed Yourden: Almost every CIO that I asked
that question gave me a knee jerk reaction.

00:21:49.519 --> 00:21:50.970
&gt;&gt;Ben Fried: Like I would never want that.

00:21:50.970 --> 00:21:52.769
I would never wanna hire them.

00:21:52.769 --> 00:21:54.289
&gt;&gt;Ed Yourden: Itís bad.

00:21:54.289 --> 00:21:55.289
Itís evil.

00:21:55.289 --> 00:21:56.289
&gt;&gt;Ben Fried: Communist.

00:21:56.289 --> 00:21:57.289
[Laughs]

00:21:57.289 --> 00:21:58.289
&gt;&gt;Ed Yourden: Yeah.

00:21:58.289 --> 00:21:59.730
But it also clear that they had never even
thought of the question

00:21:59.730 --> 00:22:01.869
before that.

00:22:01.869 --> 00:22:07.309
And the term that you used of social contract
is something that I didnít get

00:22:07.309 --> 00:22:09.880
the impression had really entered their consciousness.

00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:15.830
That this idea of a two way
relationship, now, again, itís interesting

00:22:15.830 --> 00:22:18.241
for my generation because when we graduated,
my

00:22:18.241 --> 00:22:22.340
friends and I, there was a social contract;
you went to work for IBM and it was a job

00:22:22.340 --> 00:22:23.340
for
life.

00:22:23.340 --> 00:22:26.549
And you were guaranteed to get attention when
you were 65 if you were still alive.

00:22:26.549 --> 00:22:29.279
&gt;&gt;Ben Fried: Guaranteed benefit pension, I
would add.

00:22:29.279 --> 00:22:30.279
[Laughter]

00:22:30.279 --> 00:22:34.090
&gt;&gt;Ed Yourden: But that all disappeared ten
or twenty years later.

00:22:34.090 --> 00:22:38.960
And now itís coming back
in some organizations but not in most, I think.

00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:45.280
&gt;&gt;Ben Fried: So, I had a great question on
the tip of my tongue and of course the eloquence

00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:48.029
of your answer wiped it from my mind.

00:22:48.029 --> 00:22:49.029
[Laughter]

00:22:49.029 --> 00:22:55.269
&gt;&gt;Ben Fried: Oh, I know what it is, so although
the social contract might have been

00:22:55.269 --> 00:22:59.830
something you did not hear much of, Paul Strassman,
Paul Strassman, right?

00:22:59.830 --> 00:23:06.200
From NASA and a
story, been the CIO for like 50 years or something

00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:07.200
like that?

00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:08.200
&gt;&gt;Ed Yourden: Right.

00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:11.580
&gt;&gt;Ben Fried: He did make a comment that I
thought was consistent with this idea of a

00:23:11.580 --> 00:23:12.580
social
contract.

00:23:12.580 --> 00:23:16.610
Or certainly you could put on the continuum
of thought that leads it which is

00:23:16.610 --> 00:23:21.700
that in the early days of computing when he
was first a CIO, the capital, the computer

00:23:21.700 --> 00:23:24.059
was
the dominant expensive and that people were

00:23:24.059 --> 00:23:25.059
cheap, right?

00:23:25.059 --> 00:23:26.059
&gt;&gt;Ed Yourden: Yeah.

00:23:26.059 --> 00:23:30.240
&gt;&gt;Ben Fried: And I think that, in some sense,
the social contract may exist because that

00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:32.249
proposition has been inverted, right?

00:23:32.249 --> 00:23:35.629
Computers are, relatively speaking, inexpensive
and

00:23:35.629 --> 00:23:40.950
people with a talent needed to do significant
things with them is incredibly expensive.

00:23:40.950 --> 00:23:45.580
Did that kind of, I view that as a kind of
a precursor to realizing there needs to be

00:23:45.580 --> 00:23:47.950
a
social contract, did that kind of theme about

00:23:47.950 --> 00:23:51.239
the changes and capital structure versus

00:23:51.239 --> 00:23:53.619
&gt;&gt;Ed Yourden: I didnít see that come up.

00:23:53.619 --> 00:23:54.970
&gt;&gt;Ben Fried: as opposed to staffing come up?

00:23:54.970 --> 00:23:56.309
&gt;&gt;Ed Yourden: It didnít.

00:23:56.309 --> 00:23:59.210
And itís interesting that you raise that
because this gentleman,

00:23:59.210 --> 00:24:04.279
Paul Strassman, is an amazing man.

00:24:04.279 --> 00:24:06.169
Without trying to get commercial, this book
is worth

00:24:06.169 --> 00:24:09.610
reading just for the Paul Strassman interview,
if not for Benís interview.

00:24:09.610 --> 00:24:10.610
[Laughter]

00:24:10.610 --> 00:24:12.629
&gt;&gt;Ed Yourden: This is a man in his early 80s.

00:24:12.629 --> 00:24:16.860
He fought in the Czech underground in World
War 2.

00:24:16.860 --> 00:24:22.399
He was the CIO at Xerox when Xerox PARC was
being created etcetera, etcetera,

00:24:22.399 --> 00:24:23.629
etcetera, etcetera.

00:24:23.629 --> 00:24:29.539
And, though he certainly did make this comment
about this turnaround of

00:24:29.539 --> 00:24:37.669
the relevant cost of computer gear versus
people, he was also very critical of the current

00:24:37.669 --> 00:24:39.969
generation coming out of college.

00:24:39.969 --> 00:24:47.730
He was very concerned that they were too superficial,
too shallow and not really properly educated

00:24:47.730 --> 00:24:50.070
in fundamentals.

00:24:50.070 --> 00:24:57.059
But he certainly did put that
emphasis on the expensive nature of people

00:24:57.059 --> 00:24:58.059
today.

00:24:58.059 --> 00:25:02.739
Which everybodyís aware of except that we
are still very much stuck in this phenomenon

00:25:02.739 --> 00:25:05.519
of there's lots of cheap people over there
in India

00:25:05.519 --> 00:25:08.169
or various other parts of the world.

00:25:08.169 --> 00:25:10.350
So, people here are too expensive, weíll
just

00:25:10.350 --> 00:25:13.679
outsource it, you know, make the cost go away.

00:25:13.679 --> 00:25:18.450
Thatís been going on for about 10 years.

00:25:18.450 --> 00:25:23.639
Everybody knows that, and it probably never
was true completely and certainly wonít

00:25:23.639 --> 00:25:25.130
continue to be as true in the future.

00:25:25.130 --> 00:25:29.299
But I think that still is a major factor driving
a lot

00:25:29.299 --> 00:25:30.299
of companies today.

00:25:30.299 --> 00:25:33.640
&gt;&gt;Ben Fried: Certainly if you believe in free
trade then ultimately you believe that the

00:25:33.640 --> 00:25:36.739
cost
of labor is gonna equalize over time, right?

00:25:36.739 --> 00:25:42.389
I believe, from my scattered reading of the
Economist thatís kind of one of the principles.

00:25:42.389 --> 00:25:43.389
[Laughter]

00:25:43.389 --> 00:25:44.389
&gt;&gt;Ben Fried: Is that ultimately thereíll
be equalization, right?

00:25:44.389 --> 00:25:45.389
&gt;&gt;Ed Yourden: Yeah.

00:25:45.389 --> 00:25:49.229
And by the way, youíve reminded me of a thing
that didnít come up for

00:25:49.229 --> 00:25:53.950
conversation very often and whenever it did
I wasnít sure I trusted the kind of glib

00:25:53.950 --> 00:26:01.399
answers I was getting from CIOs and that was
the relative importance of free software.

00:26:01.399 --> 00:26:08.649
Particularly when put in the hands of people
whose labor costs are minimal at the moment,

00:26:08.649 --> 00:26:13.700
of which obviously you guys have got several
wonderful examples.

00:26:13.700 --> 00:26:17.820
When I began asking CIOs
of more traditional companies, ìhow important

00:26:17.820 --> 00:26:22.870
is gonna be that a million people in Africa
or a million people in Asia or a million people

00:26:22.870 --> 00:26:30.289
anywhere to use free tools on essentially
free mobile devices to create valuable stuff?î

00:26:30.289 --> 00:26:31.289
They said.

00:26:31.289 --> 00:26:35.559
ìOh yeah, itís important.î And I
didnít feel that there was anything behind

00:26:35.559 --> 00:26:36.559
that.

00:26:36.559 --> 00:26:45.169
&gt;&gt;Ben Fried: Do you think that, um, CIOs,
especially at larger more established companies,

00:26:45.169 --> 00:26:48.789
are they close enough to the domain, to technology
anymore?

00:26:48.789 --> 00:26:53.379
I mean, I wonder if the answer,
the reason for that question if your job at

00:26:53.379 --> 00:26:55.179
some point is to manage a large organization
and

00:26:55.179 --> 00:26:59.929
a large budget and a group of managers who
manage other managers who manage other managers

00:26:59.929 --> 00:27:03.549
and so on and so on, it can become hard to
have these insights that really require one

00:27:03.549 --> 00:27:05.519
to stand at
the coal face of the problem, right?

00:27:05.519 --> 00:27:08.340
Since you yourself, you own the coal mine
you donít

00:27:08.340 --> 00:27:10.029
stand at the coal face, perhaps, right?

00:27:10.029 --> 00:27:12.379
&gt;&gt;Ed Yourden: That may be true.

00:27:12.379 --> 00:27:15.879
Particularly if you have no had your companyís
and your

00:27:15.879 --> 00:27:19.240
empireís existence threatened by such things.

00:27:19.240 --> 00:27:23.360
I had a good example, myself, or a good
experience myself in that area just a couple

00:27:23.360 --> 00:27:25.059
of months ago.

00:27:25.059 --> 00:27:29.859
I took one of these weekend
photography seminars here at the International

00:27:29.859 --> 00:27:31.470
Center of Photography.

00:27:31.470 --> 00:27:38.899
It was a weekend course
on doing photography with your IPhone and

00:27:38.899 --> 00:27:40.250
with the current model of IPhone youíve got
a

00:27:40.250 --> 00:27:42.219
decent camera, finally.

00:27:42.219 --> 00:27:46.609
But what I didnít appreciate was the enormous
variety of apps that

00:27:46.609 --> 00:27:52.570
are anywhere from 99 cents to zero which collectively
are almost equivalent to Photoshop.

00:27:52.570 --> 00:27:59.549
And I thought, ìMan, if I were the king of
the Photoshop empire, I would be terrified.î

00:27:59.549 --> 00:28:04.130
Because thereís this stuff out there thatís
just amazing to see what itíll do and if

00:28:04.130 --> 00:28:07.580
thatís
true for digital photography itís true for

00:28:07.580 --> 00:28:09.210
any number of other things.

00:28:09.210 --> 00:28:14.330
&gt;&gt;Ben Fried: Is that emergence the rise of
free, accountable for the rise of free software

00:28:14.330 --> 00:28:19.509
or is that a function of, is that yet another
one of the ways that technologyís serving

00:28:19.509 --> 00:28:22.839
consumers first is kind of different from
the past?

00:28:22.839 --> 00:28:24.989
&gt;&gt;Ed Yourden: I think itís all of those things.

00:28:24.989 --> 00:28:29.690
Yes, it certainly does depend, at least to
some extent, on the idea of going out to the

00:28:29.690 --> 00:28:32.809
consumer market place first and then later
on

00:28:32.809 --> 00:28:37.460
bringing it into the company and percolating
upwards.

00:28:37.460 --> 00:28:42.200
I think itís also a function of what
Clay Shirky calls the cognitive surplus, youíve

00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:47.129
got an awful lot of people with time on
their hands, maybe 3 hours in the evening

00:28:47.129 --> 00:28:49.499
and free competing power who say, ìHm.

00:28:49.499 --> 00:28:51.969
I can
create a clever little app which does one

00:28:51.969 --> 00:28:54.200
little thing but has clean interfaces.î I
mean,

00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:58.450
itís the Unix paradigm, as well, so they
can be connected to other things that we donít

00:28:58.450 --> 00:28:59.779
even
know about yet.

00:28:59.779 --> 00:29:03.849
I think itís several of those things that
are all converging to create a

00:29:03.849 --> 00:29:12.739
collective impact that, again, the traditional
CIO who's got a very big empire, I think is

00:29:12.739 --> 00:29:14.720
incapable of recognizing.

00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:20.999
&gt;&gt;Ben Fried: Man, itís kind of a, I mean,
I think these are the things that make our

00:29:20.999 --> 00:29:22.460
industry so fascinating, right?

00:29:22.460 --> 00:29:24.909
How many other industries change so much over
the course of

00:29:24.909 --> 00:29:26.130
five, ten years, right?

00:29:26.130 --> 00:29:27.350
&gt;&gt;Ed Yourden: Yeah, yeah.

00:29:27.350 --> 00:29:33.619
&gt;&gt;Ben Fried: So, along the subject of change,
based on whatís happened since you started

00:29:33.619 --> 00:29:37.049
the book, for example, based on what you learned
by writing it, are there questions you wish

00:29:37.049 --> 00:29:38.789
you had asked but didnít?

00:29:38.789 --> 00:29:42.479
&gt;&gt;Ed Yourden: Um, sure, yeah.

00:29:42.479 --> 00:29:45.070
One of the questions I was particularly interested
in and

00:29:45.070 --> 00:29:50.720
actually thought Iíd be able to ask but couldnít,
was how companies that are in the same

00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:54.389
industry are using information to compete
against each other effectively.

00:29:54.389 --> 00:29:59.479
I mean, you look
in the auto industry, how is it that Honda,

00:29:59.479 --> 00:30:02.750
Toyota and General Motors and so on, can compete
using

00:30:02.750 --> 00:30:05.509
information?

00:30:05.509 --> 00:30:10.070
Take the financial services industry, actually
that one also illustrated

00:30:10.070 --> 00:30:14.070
another one of the biggest surprises that
I had working on this book which is the number

00:30:14.070 --> 00:30:18.169
of companies that were not about to let me
talk to their CIO.

00:30:18.169 --> 00:30:21.460
I anticipated that with CIOs
who were too busy.

00:30:21.460 --> 00:30:25.110
I tried to get the new CIO of General Motors,
too busy.

00:30:25.110 --> 00:30:27.309
I knew that
some CIOs would be embarrassed.

00:30:27.309 --> 00:30:29.129
&gt;&gt;Ben Fried: I think heís no long there.

00:30:29.129 --> 00:30:30.461
&gt;&gt;Ed Yourden: Oh, is that right?

00:30:30.461 --> 00:30:31.461
[Laughs]

00:30:31.461 --> 00:30:32.461
&gt;&gt;Ben Fried: Yeah, they changed CIOs recently.

00:30:32.461 --> 00:30:33.461
&gt;&gt;Ed Yourden: Oh dear.

00:30:33.461 --> 00:30:34.461
Oh well.

00:30:34.461 --> 00:30:35.461
&gt;&gt;Ben Fried: I think he had less than 18 months.

00:30:35.461 --> 00:30:36.461
[Laughter]

00:30:36.461 --> 00:30:37.461
&gt;&gt;Ed Yourden: Iím not surprised, actually.

00:30:37.461 --> 00:30:39.399
I tried to get the CIO of British Petroleum
a few

00:30:39.399 --> 00:30:41.499
months after the Gulf oil spill.

00:30:41.499 --> 00:30:42.499
[Laughter]

00:30:42.499 --> 00:30:43.519
&gt;&gt;Ed Yourden: Well, I knew that was a lost
cause.

00:30:43.519 --> 00:30:49.559
But then there were the CIOs of the Wall
Street financial community and there I got

00:30:49.559 --> 00:30:51.739
just this hostile stone wall of resistance.

00:30:51.739 --> 00:30:55.059
They
did not want to talk to me at all which I

00:30:55.059 --> 00:30:56.619
had not anticipated.

00:30:56.619 --> 00:31:00.409
But if I had been able to
talk to the CIO of Goldman Sachs, Merrill

00:31:00.409 --> 00:31:06.331
Lynch, you know, blah, blah, blah all of those,
Iíd wanna know how they use information to

00:31:06.331 --> 00:31:08.230
effectively to compete against each other
and I

00:31:08.230 --> 00:31:14.619
suspect I would not have gotten a very full
answer because youíre kind of giving away

00:31:14.619 --> 00:31:15.850
the
crown jewel.

00:31:15.850 --> 00:31:19.389
&gt;&gt;Ben Fried: The irony is almost everyone
who works on IT on Wall Street, which is

00:31:19.389 --> 00:31:22.980
thousands and thousands of people here, has
some idea to the answer of that question,

00:31:22.980 --> 00:31:23.980
right?

00:31:23.980 --> 00:31:26.399
Itís the interesting unusual things that
theyíve done become widely known.

00:31:26.399 --> 00:31:29.789
People in, I
worked in Wall Street for awhile so I know

00:31:29.789 --> 00:31:33.859
a little bit about it, but thereís so much
movement.

00:31:33.859 --> 00:31:39.320
Historically thereís so much movement from
IT department to IT department that if

00:31:39.320 --> 00:31:44.279
someone spends a decade in Wall Street IT,
chances are they know people at, or they

00:31:44.279 --> 00:31:49.509
themselves have not been at one of these major
companies and they know something about the

00:31:49.509 --> 00:31:52.309
IT secret sauce is or was in a particular
area.

00:31:52.309 --> 00:31:53.399
&gt;&gt;Ed Yourden: Probably so.

00:31:53.399 --> 00:31:57.080
The other question I wish I had been able
to ask but probably

00:31:57.080 --> 00:32:03.169
would not have gotten a straight answer to
is how the decision making goes up the chain

00:32:03.169 --> 00:32:06.289
of
command, if the company is facing a severe

00:32:06.289 --> 00:32:12.979
crisis that was ultimately caused by a computer
problem, and what made me think about it was

00:32:12.979 --> 00:32:15.419
all the news we were hearing about a year
ago

00:32:15.419 --> 00:32:19.210
about the alleged engineering problems in
Toyota automobiles.

00:32:19.210 --> 00:32:22.099
&gt;&gt;Ben Fried: Oh, right, what was that, what
was it the floor mats?

00:32:22.099 --> 00:32:25.279
&gt;&gt;Ed Yourden: The floor mat, accelerator or
whatever.

00:32:25.279 --> 00:32:26.279
&gt;&gt;Ben Fried: Brake pedal?

00:32:26.279 --> 00:32:27.279
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:32:27.279 --> 00:32:29.359
&gt;&gt;Ed Yourden: Now, there was a lot of talk
that that was a software problem.

00:32:29.359 --> 00:32:32.629
&gt;&gt;Ben Fried: Right cause it turned out the
brake pedal or that accelerator doesnít actually

00:32:32.629 --> 00:32:33.730
control the flow of gas.

00:32:33.730 --> 00:32:36.700
Iím a New Yorker, I donít really understand
cars.

00:32:36.700 --> 00:32:37.700
[Laughter]

00:32:37.700 --> 00:32:41.729
&gt;&gt;Ben Fried: Iím not the right person to
ask but apparently its multiple servos and

00:32:41.729 --> 00:32:44.559
AD
converters and so on and low level controller

00:32:44.559 --> 00:32:45.559
software.

00:32:45.559 --> 00:32:50.960
I thought it was just a lever
controlling a valve somewhere but no, naÔve

00:32:50.960 --> 00:32:51.960
of me.

00:32:51.960 --> 00:32:54.389
&gt;&gt;Ed Yourden: And you can imagine a number
of other companies in a variety of industries

00:32:54.389 --> 00:33:01.970
where a flaw of some kind, whether hardware
or software or combined, ultimately causes

00:33:01.970 --> 00:33:06.700
a
severe crisis that causes a management reaction

00:33:06.700 --> 00:33:07.700
up the chain of commands.

00:33:07.700 --> 00:33:10.659
And then
ultimately some decision or statement is made

00:33:10.659 --> 00:33:14.339
by a vice president who probably doesnít
know anything at all about the underlying

00:33:14.339 --> 00:33:17.129
engineering.

00:33:17.129 --> 00:33:22.759
And I was curious to see how that
might take place in a Japanese company versus

00:33:22.759 --> 00:33:24.769
an American company versus a German company.

00:33:24.769 --> 00:33:27.509
&gt;&gt;Ben Fried: Thereís been these other interesting
examples like, that speaks kind of

00:33:27.509 --> 00:33:29.429
similarly to that.

00:33:29.429 --> 00:33:32.479
There were the centrifuges which are in Iran,
right?

00:33:32.479 --> 00:33:35.889
Destroyed by the Siemens
they used a Siemens industrial controller

00:33:35.889 --> 00:33:36.889
&gt;&gt;Ed Yourden: Right.

00:33:36.889 --> 00:33:40.360
&gt;&gt;Ben Fried: And probably some nation state
introduced this software attack

00:33:40.360 --> 00:33:41.360
[Laughter]

00:33:41.360 --> 00:33:44.500
&gt;&gt;Ben Fried: into these things that actually
permanently damaged these difficult to obtain

00:33:44.500 --> 00:33:45.799
ultra
centrifuges, right?

00:33:45.799 --> 00:33:52.240
But thatís another example of software having
such a real concrete

00:33:52.240 --> 00:33:54.519
problem in the operation of an organization.

00:33:54.519 --> 00:33:55.549
&gt;&gt;Ed Yourden: Yeah.

00:33:55.549 --> 00:33:59.559
&gt;&gt;Ben Fried: And then similarly thereís all
these people working on software and critical

00:33:59.559 --> 00:34:02.839
infrastructure and itís gotten to the point
where itís too depressing for me to read

00:34:02.839 --> 00:34:03.959
what
these people find.

00:34:03.959 --> 00:34:08.210
You find these videos of a bug that causes
a steam generator to explode

00:34:08.210 --> 00:34:10.250
or things like that, ya know?

00:34:10.250 --> 00:34:13.030
&gt;&gt;Ed Yourden: Itís interesting that you mention
the Iran thing because, again, the question

00:34:13.030 --> 00:34:19.849
is how did that discovery of the Siemen problem
actually percolate up the chain of command

00:34:19.849 --> 00:34:21.659
and how many people got executed as a result?

00:34:21.659 --> 00:34:22.659
[Laughter]

00:34:22.659 --> 00:34:25.669
&gt;&gt;Ben Fried: I donít think my next CIO job
will be in Iran.

00:34:25.669 --> 00:34:26.669
[Laughter]

00:34:26.669 --> 00:34:27.869
&gt;&gt;Ed Yourden: Or in North Korea, hopefully.

00:34:27.869 --> 00:34:28.869
&gt;&gt;Ben Fried: Yeah.

00:34:28.869 --> 00:34:30.589
Oh yeah, thatís right, failure to launch.

00:34:30.589 --> 00:34:36.429
&gt;&gt;Ed Yourden: So, I think those are the main
questions I wish Iíd been able to ask.

00:34:36.429 --> 00:34:39.419
Since
computers are so essential to virtually everything

00:34:39.419 --> 00:34:44.110
that every company is doing these days,
doesnít always go right and when there are

00:34:44.110 --> 00:34:51.720
severe problems, how does the executive leadership
deal with it if theyíve come from a era that

00:34:51.720 --> 00:34:53.500
didnít really understand the technology to
begin

00:34:53.500 --> 00:34:54.500
with?

00:34:54.500 --> 00:34:58.430
&gt;&gt;Ben Fried: So I think that this raises a
really interesting point which is that computers

00:34:58.430 --> 00:35:00.450
are critical everywhere.

00:35:00.450 --> 00:35:04.349
Theyíre in everything; theyíre in the gas
pedal, right?

00:35:04.349 --> 00:35:06.489
I mean,
theyíre in things that I certainly didnít

00:35:06.489 --> 00:35:10.359
expect to be, kind of, computational devices,
right?

00:35:10.359 --> 00:35:14.250
Having met with CIOs from so many diverse
industries, do you think that there is

00:35:14.250 --> 00:35:19.230
enough talent, enough computing talent in
the world to support this use of, you know,

00:35:19.230 --> 00:35:20.540
the
fact that computers are everywhere?

00:35:20.540 --> 00:35:23.039
Do you think that they all have access to
the people

00:35:23.039 --> 00:35:25.400
they need to do the jobs they need to do?

00:35:25.400 --> 00:35:27.380
I mean, this isnít just the, ìCan you hire
enough

00:35:27.380 --> 00:35:28.380
people question.

00:35:28.380 --> 00:35:32.089
Iím trying to ask the slightly deeper version
of that which is do these

00:35:32.089 --> 00:35:34.810
organizations actually function at the level
that they need to?

00:35:34.810 --> 00:35:40.089
&gt;&gt;Ed Yourden: Well, that is a philosophical
question that could keep us going for quite

00:35:40.089 --> 00:35:42.800
a
long time.

00:35:42.800 --> 00:35:46.550
When I was just getting started in the field
people like Edsger Dijkstra arguing

00:35:46.550 --> 00:35:50.910
that we shouldnít even be attempting to build
things as complex as we were building because

00:35:50.910 --> 00:35:53.160
we have no hope of ever proving theyíre running
correctly.

00:35:53.160 --> 00:35:54.160
&gt;&gt;Ben Fried: Yeah.

00:35:54.160 --> 00:35:58.510
&gt;&gt;Ed Yourden: So that we ought to scale down
our expectations and do very simple things.

00:35:58.510 --> 00:36:01.099
Well, obviously society hasnít agreed with
that.

00:36:01.099 --> 00:36:07.740
So, I think whatís happening is that, we,
and our various companies are building things

00:36:07.740 --> 00:36:12.529
right up to some threshold of collapse and
failure and muddling along.

00:36:12.529 --> 00:36:17.589
I donít think most companies have the caliber
of talent that

00:36:17.589 --> 00:36:21.609
they really need in their IT department.

00:36:21.609 --> 00:36:23.859
It was because of that, quite frankly, that
I was

00:36:23.859 --> 00:36:27.910
so concerned that the Y2K problem would be
much bigger than it turned out to be.

00:36:27.910 --> 00:36:31.680
It actually
turned out to be much bigger than newspapers

00:36:31.680 --> 00:36:34.630
ever admitted but thatís whole other
discussion.

00:36:34.630 --> 00:36:42.799
Weíve got these systems that are barely wobbling
along and a major disruption

00:36:42.799 --> 00:36:48.829
of almost any kind could bring them to their
knees, whether itís competitive or economic

00:36:48.829 --> 00:36:49.829
or
malicious.

00:36:49.829 --> 00:36:54.640
Thatís, of course, one of the things that
we have to be a lot more worried about

00:36:54.640 --> 00:37:00.910
today than we might've even ten years ago
is the malicious deliberate attempt to bring

00:37:00.910 --> 00:37:02.289
our
systems down.

00:37:02.289 --> 00:37:05.910
&gt;&gt;Ben Fried: Yeah, I like the way that Strassman
kind of referred to the martial

00:37:05.910 --> 00:37:09.430
implications of computing and is one concern
about infiltration and one concern about

00:37:09.430 --> 00:37:14.859
exfiltration is there always been a tax on
the supply chain or maybe it was Vivek who

00:37:14.859 --> 00:37:18.450
talked about thereís always been a tax on
the supply chain and how the supply chain

00:37:18.450 --> 00:37:20.420
is
cyber as well, right?

00:37:20.420 --> 00:37:25.130
&gt;&gt;Ed Yourden: Yeah and heís doing a lot of
consulting and a lot of lecturing down in

00:37:25.130 --> 00:37:28.579
the Pentagon
on those topics.

00:37:28.579 --> 00:37:31.880
&gt;&gt;Ben Fried: So was there a CIO you wish you
couldíve interviewed but didnít?

00:37:31.880 --> 00:37:35.029
Or was there
was that you thought this man or woman would

00:37:35.029 --> 00:37:36.079
really have been--

00:37:36.079 --> 00:37:42.280
&gt;&gt;Ed Yourden: Well, thereís a bunch that
I wish I had been able to interview.

00:37:42.280 --> 00:37:46.230
Yeah, I
didnít get anybody from the auto industry

00:37:46.230 --> 00:37:50.559
and given the number of computers and the
amount

00:37:50.559 --> 00:37:56.010
of code that is in the typical automobile
today, I really wish I'd been able to get

00:37:56.010 --> 00:37:57.599
a bit more of an insight.

00:37:57.599 --> 00:38:01.470
I wonder how worried they are whenever any
car goes roaring down the

00:38:01.470 --> 00:38:02.470
highway.

00:38:02.470 --> 00:38:03.470
ìIs this stuff actually gonna work?î

00:38:03.470 --> 00:38:04.470
[Laughter]

00:38:04.470 --> 00:38:08.400
&gt;&gt;Ben Fried: Thereís a group, I think at
UCSD that looks at tech, IT and cars and kind

00:38:08.400 --> 00:38:10.329
of
attacks on that and so on, itís fascinating

00:38:10.329 --> 00:38:11.329
stuff.

00:38:11.329 --> 00:38:13.119
I could send you some papers of the
attacks on these

00:38:13.119 --> 00:38:14.119
&gt;&gt;Ed Yourden: Iíd be interested in that.

00:38:14.119 --> 00:38:17.380
&gt;&gt;Ben Fried: cars and how it works and how
you can get in the control systems from the

00:38:17.380 --> 00:38:18.380
peripheral systems.

00:38:18.380 --> 00:38:21.309
Itís scary, especially for someone like me
whoís a New Yorker and

00:38:21.309 --> 00:38:22.670
doesnít really drive much.

00:38:22.670 --> 00:38:23.670
[Laughter]

00:38:23.670 --> 00:38:29.631
&gt;&gt;Ed Yourden: And some of the critical infrastructure
people, I wish Iíd been able to have

00:38:29.631 --> 00:38:31.529
more interviews with them.

00:38:31.529 --> 00:38:35.319
I interviewed a couple people from traditional
utility companies

00:38:35.319 --> 00:38:40.289
but even they are involved in some pretty
amazing things these days.

00:38:40.289 --> 00:38:42.960
In terms of the
concerns that they expressed about what would

00:38:42.960 --> 00:38:47.220
happen if their part of the grid came down.

00:38:47.220 --> 00:38:50.780
So it would have been interesting to hear
a bit more about that.

00:38:50.780 --> 00:38:51.790
&gt;&gt;Ben Fried: Yeah.

00:38:51.790 --> 00:38:53.920
&gt;&gt;Ed Yourden: But thereís always time for
another book

00:38:53.920 --> 00:38:54.920
[laughs]

00:38:54.920 --> 00:38:56.000
&gt;&gt;Ben Fried: Yeah, well Iím glad to hear
it.

00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:57.000
The book was a great read.

00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:59.079
I think weíre
probably at the time we should go to questions.

00:38:59.079 --> 00:39:02.619
Is there, I donít know if there was a
moderator page with questions put up or if

00:39:02.619 --> 00:39:04.849
weíre just gonna do questions, live questions
from the audience?

00:39:04.849 --> 00:39:07.140
Are there questions from the audience?

00:39:07.140 --> 00:39:08.140
[Pause]

00:39:08.140 --> 00:39:12.369
&gt;&gt;Ben Fried: Alright, a brave man.

00:39:12.369 --> 00:39:15.490
&gt;&gt;Ed Yourden: Thereís always the ice breaker.

00:39:15.490 --> 00:39:16.490
[Laughs]

00:39:16.490 --> 00:39:17.490
&gt;&gt;Ben Fried: Yeah.

00:39:17.490 --> 00:39:18.490
Thank you.

00:39:18.490 --> 00:39:19.490
&gt;&gt;male #1: Hi, thanks for coming.

00:39:19.490 --> 00:39:21.019
So you mentioned cloud computing early on
and you said

00:39:21.019 --> 00:39:26.680
that was one of the issues that kind of across
the board you were hearing CIOs say that

00:39:26.680 --> 00:39:32.369
that was gonna be in the near term future,
what they were considering for operation.

00:39:32.369 --> 00:39:34.279
One
thing I always that would be interesting about

00:39:34.279 --> 00:39:39.791
that is that fundamentally if you wanted to
do it right and obviously we at Google, big

00:39:39.791 --> 00:39:42.569
bet on cloud computing, you have to actually
give up

00:39:42.569 --> 00:39:46.000
some of the control you have as a CIO.

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:47.650
Did you see any of that kind of playing out
in your

00:39:47.650 --> 00:39:51.269
discussion and what were the CIOs opinions
towards that?

00:39:51.269 --> 00:39:55.390
&gt;&gt;Ed Yourden: I didnít hear that connection

00:39:55.390 --> 00:39:56.390
[Coughing]

00:39:56.390 --> 00:40:02.000
&gt;&gt;Ed Yourden: between acceptance of cloud
computing and loss of control which is an

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:03.000
interesting one.

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:06.470
Actually, more commonly, I heard the opinion
from some of these older CIOs

00:40:06.470 --> 00:40:11.910
that cloud computing is just a new word for
an old idea, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

00:40:11.910 --> 00:40:16.200
But
the general point about giving up control

00:40:16.200 --> 00:40:18.640
is one that had occurred to me in a couple
other

00:40:18.640 --> 00:40:22.769
respects that also did not get addressed.

00:40:22.769 --> 00:40:23.930
One of the things that I wanted to ask about
was

00:40:23.930 --> 00:40:27.900
agile computing and theyíre all in favor
of it, they all thought it was a great idea.

00:40:27.900 --> 00:40:29.270
But
when you listen to them they all just thought

00:40:29.270 --> 00:40:31.670
it meant doing the same old stuff faster.

00:40:31.670 --> 00:40:32.670
[Laughter]

00:40:32.670 --> 00:40:37.640
&gt;&gt;Ed Yourden: As opposed to some of the stronger
opinions about agile computing, it does

00:40:37.640 --> 00:40:40.700
require giving up a lot of centralized control.

00:40:40.700 --> 00:40:47.430
But on the subject of cloud computing, no,
I donít know whether they were in favor of

00:40:47.430 --> 00:40:48.430
it or against it.

00:40:48.430 --> 00:40:50.500
We just, we didnít get there in that part
of the

00:40:50.500 --> 00:40:52.590
discussion.

00:40:52.590 --> 00:40:57.059
They all just agreed, whereas, again, five
years ago they would have said never

00:40:57.059 --> 00:40:58.470
over my dead body, blah, blah, blah.

00:40:58.470 --> 00:40:59.900
Then three years ago theyíd say nah.

00:40:59.900 --> 00:41:05.289
And now they will
tell you some concerns and cautions and theyíll

00:41:05.289 --> 00:41:08.819
point to a trouble or a horror story somewhere
that

00:41:08.819 --> 00:41:10.680
theyíve seen in the trade journals.

00:41:10.680 --> 00:41:13.780
But they all know that itís coming and a
lot of them

00:41:13.780 --> 00:41:16.540
will say itís a good thing.

00:41:16.540 --> 00:41:19.740
But the idea that it may require them to give
up some control,

00:41:19.740 --> 00:41:25.910
like I was saying before, I think thatís
a really deep cultural thing in a lot of these

00:41:25.910 --> 00:41:33.859
companies that theyíve had a mindset of control
for 30 or 40 years.

00:41:33.859 --> 00:41:38.539
Particularly because
computing hardware in networks and databases

00:41:38.539 --> 00:41:43.140
and so on were amongst the most precious and
most scarce and most expensive resources and

00:41:43.140 --> 00:41:45.030
assets that a company had.

00:41:45.030 --> 00:41:47.970
It had to be controlled and protected.

00:41:47.970 --> 00:41:52.520
And the idea that itís now free and plentiful
and pervasive and so on, theyíre still getting

00:41:52.520 --> 00:41:53.619
used to that idea.

00:41:53.619 --> 00:41:56.039
&gt;&gt;Ben Fried: So I thought, Iím sorry did
you have a follow up question?

00:41:56.039 --> 00:41:57.039
&gt;&gt;male #1: No, thank you.

00:41:57.039 --> 00:41:59.080
&gt;&gt;Ben Fried: I thought on the subject of the
cloud, I thought the interview with Vivek

00:41:59.080 --> 00:42:04.160
Kundra who was the United States CIO at the
time was fascinating.

00:42:04.160 --> 00:42:06.580
Because unlike many of
your CIOs, essentially, he was dropped in

00:42:06.580 --> 00:42:10.660
at the top of the organization, the federal
government spends I think he says like 80

00:42:10.660 --> 00:42:11.710
billion dollars

00:42:11.710 --> 00:42:12.710
&gt;&gt;Ed Yourden: Yeah.

00:42:12.710 --> 00:42:14.750
&gt;&gt;Ben Fried: And thatís not including the
black part of the budget, right, thatís just

00:42:14.750 --> 00:42:17.450
kind of, thereís 80 billion dollars that
we can see them spend on IT

00:42:17.450 --> 00:42:18.450
&gt;&gt;Ed Yourden: Right.

00:42:18.450 --> 00:42:20.109
&gt;&gt;Ben Fried: And itís controlled by these
departmental CIOs, right?

00:42:20.109 --> 00:42:24.759
I mean, thereís, I mean,
they have entire conferences of federal CIOs

00:42:24.759 --> 00:42:26.369
as I understand it, thereís lots and lots
and

00:42:26.369 --> 00:42:27.480
lots of them.

00:42:27.480 --> 00:42:31.079
And hereís this guy dropped in on top of
all these people, he had very little

00:42:31.079 --> 00:42:38.700
actual authority over them but trying to give
his boss and the American people, you know,

00:42:38.700 --> 00:42:43.079
levers and transparency to what was going
on in all of these small IT organizations.

00:42:43.079 --> 00:42:44.960
For him
the cloud was incredibly important.

00:42:44.960 --> 00:42:47.339
There was so much waste, thereís what, 2000
federal data

00:42:47.339 --> 00:42:49.280
centers or something like that?

00:42:49.280 --> 00:42:53.619
Operating on something like 26 percent utilization,
something along those lines.

00:42:53.619 --> 00:42:54.619
&gt;&gt;Ed Yourden: Yeah.

00:42:54.619 --> 00:42:58.380
&gt;&gt;Ben Fried: And I was fascinated reading,
hereís a CIO whoís actually trying to be

00:42:58.380 --> 00:43:00.559
an
agent of change, whoís trying to fight the

00:43:00.559 --> 00:43:05.410
forces of inertia that existed at this lower
level of CIO, underneath him.

00:43:05.410 --> 00:43:08.430
I thought that was, in that way, the interview
with him was

00:43:08.430 --> 00:43:13.039
very different from most of the others where
all these people were much more the commanders

00:43:13.039 --> 00:43:14.619
of
their organizations, I guess.

00:43:14.619 --> 00:43:19.030
&gt;&gt;Ed Yourden: Thatís true, although, Kundra
left about a month after I conducted the interview.

00:43:19.030 --> 00:43:20.030
[Laughter]

00:43:20.030 --> 00:43:23.550
&gt;&gt;Ed Yourden: And itís interesting also that
nearly 30 years ago, Paul Strassman, whose

00:43:23.550 --> 00:43:25.000
name
we mentioned already

00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:26.000
&gt;&gt;Ben Fried: Right.

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:31.720
&gt;&gt;Ed Yourden: was a deputy secretary of the
defense department, in charge of their IT

00:43:31.720 --> 00:43:33.849
and
said the same thing; 2000 data centers blah,

00:43:33.849 --> 00:43:36.430
blah, blah, and Iím gonna change it.

00:43:36.430 --> 00:43:38.950
And he
was ready to shoot them all if he had to,

00:43:38.950 --> 00:43:40.759
given his Czech military background.

00:43:40.759 --> 00:43:41.759
[Laughter]

00:43:41.759 --> 00:43:46.740
&gt;&gt;Ed Yourden: But he said what he had not
anticipated was how stubborn these people

00:43:46.740 --> 00:43:49.770
could
be knowing full well that when the next administration

00:43:49.770 --> 00:43:52.779
came along heíd be gone.

00:43:52.779 --> 00:43:56.970
These people
are protecting their empire over a 20 year

00:43:56.970 --> 00:43:59.410
period, their career and they can outlast
you,

00:43:59.410 --> 00:44:03.190
they can hold their breath, said they donít
really care.

00:44:03.190 --> 00:44:06.279
So it was interesting seeing Vivek
Kundraís thing.

00:44:06.279 --> 00:44:10.609
To me, one of the more interesting examples
or stories from this Vivek

00:44:10.609 --> 00:44:18.410
Kundra interview was his very simple experiment
in the city of Washington to get people to

00:44:18.410 --> 00:44:24.960
write little smart phone apps and he didnít
pay them all but he said, ìIím gonna have

00:44:24.960 --> 00:44:28.049
a
contestî and the winner gets a thousand dollars

00:44:28.049 --> 00:44:29.720
or something like that.

00:44:29.720 --> 00:44:33.690
And he ended up
with dozens, if not hundreds of smart phone

00:44:33.690 --> 00:44:40.580
apps that have been created by ordinary citizens
and contributed whose collective business

00:44:40.580 --> 00:44:42.190
value was astronomical.

00:44:42.190 --> 00:44:48.079
So this idea that society
is available and has got a lot of smart people

00:44:48.079 --> 00:44:52.420
and we can take advantage of crowd computing
and so on, I think they really woke up a lot

00:44:52.420 --> 00:44:56.650
of people in the Washington bureaucracy.

00:44:56.650 --> 00:44:57.650
We got
a question down here.

00:44:57.650 --> 00:45:00.720
&gt;&gt;male #2: Yeah, so I guess I have a meta
question since youíre talking about culture

00:45:00.720 --> 00:45:01.720
so
much.

00:45:01.720 --> 00:45:05.769
So, you know, in computing of course itís,
generally itís a young field and we all

00:45:05.769 --> 00:45:09.250
hit college and we knew that we knew how to
do it and these people twenty years older

00:45:09.250 --> 00:45:12.559
than
us were dinosaurs using Mainframes or Windows

00:45:12.559 --> 00:45:15.200
or whatever their old tech du jour was.

00:45:15.200 --> 00:45:18.069
Of
course, now by the time youíre CIO youíve

00:45:18.069 --> 00:45:21.380
kind of almost become, I wouldnít say necessarily
a dinosaur

00:45:21.380 --> 00:45:22.380
[Laughter]

00:45:22.380 --> 00:45:23.380
&gt;&gt;male #2: Particularly because Benís my
boss.

00:45:23.380 --> 00:45:24.380
[Laughter]

00:45:24.380 --> 00:45:25.380
&gt;&gt;male #2: But

00:45:25.380 --> 00:45:26.380
&gt;&gt;Ben Fried: I think of myself more as a woolly
mammoth but ya know.

00:45:26.380 --> 00:45:27.380
[Laughter]

00:45:27.380 --> 00:45:33.720
&gt;&gt;male #2: But Iím curious how do the CIOs,
did the CIOs come across as kind of, ìOh

00:45:33.720 --> 00:45:37.240
these
kids are snapping at my heels and oh this

00:45:37.240 --> 00:45:39.630
changeî or did it come across, ìThis is
awesome!

00:45:39.630 --> 00:45:41.280
The worlds changing, new tech!î

00:45:41.280 --> 00:45:44.359
&gt;&gt;Ed Yourden: I think it was in between, I
think.

00:45:44.359 --> 00:45:50.160
Ben has expressed some frustration that
they donít seem to be radical enough or aggressive

00:45:50.160 --> 00:45:51.700
enough and so on.

00:45:51.700 --> 00:45:57.190
I was expecting the
first characterization of this generation

00:45:57.190 --> 00:46:01.660
of young kids there, you know, theyíre
unmanageable and theyíre unwashed and theyíre

00:46:01.660 --> 00:46:03.640
uncivil and blah, blah, blah.

00:46:03.640 --> 00:46:05.800
I didnít get
that at all.

00:46:05.800 --> 00:46:10.880
And I asked that question just about to everyone
and was surprised at how

00:46:10.880 --> 00:46:18.420
positive they were about the education, the
skills, the work ethic and everything else

00:46:18.420 --> 00:46:21.509
you
can imagine of the current generation of college

00:46:21.509 --> 00:46:23.220
graduates.

00:46:23.220 --> 00:46:26.009
With the exception of Paul
Strassman who said that they were shallow

00:46:26.009 --> 00:46:27.990
and superficial and glib and they expected
too

00:46:27.990 --> 00:46:29.579
much and so on.

00:46:29.579 --> 00:46:33.480
But generally they were all very, very positive
which was encouraging.

00:46:33.480 --> 00:46:38.559
And
this is from a group of CIOs that ranged from

00:46:38.559 --> 00:46:42.529
their late 20s early 30s up to their early
to mid 60s.

00:46:42.529 --> 00:46:46.450
So the older ones I was expecting to be very
negative with lots of stories

00:46:46.450 --> 00:46:50.780
about the good old days when men were men
and we all walked to work barefoot and so

00:46:50.780 --> 00:46:51.780
on.

00:46:51.780 --> 00:46:53.619
I
didnít get that which was interesting.

00:46:53.619 --> 00:46:56.040
&gt;&gt;male #2: Thank you.

00:46:56.040 --> 00:46:57.040
[Pause]

00:46:57.040 --> 00:47:02.100
&gt;&gt;female #1: I actually have a follow up question.

00:47:02.100 --> 00:47:03.910
&gt;&gt;Ed Yourden: Okay.

00:47:03.910 --> 00:47:09.720
&gt;&gt;Ben Fried: Can you use the microphone so
that you can be recorded for posterity.

00:47:09.720 --> 00:47:11.010
[Laughs]

00:47:11.010 --> 00:47:17.509
&gt;&gt;female #1: Um, just a little follow up to
that question.

00:47:17.509 --> 00:47:23.430
Did they talk in specific about
any kind of changes that they could foresee

00:47:23.430 --> 00:47:25.819
about with the younger generation coming in
the

00:47:25.819 --> 00:47:31.799
workforce who are, perhaps, more comfortable
and more familiar with technology either in

00:47:31.799 --> 00:47:37.950
the IT department or any other areas of the
business, good or bad?

00:47:37.950 --> 00:47:42.549
&gt;&gt;Ed Yourden: I didnít hear that discussed
in term of changes but rather just one of

00:47:42.549 --> 00:47:46.410
the
positive attributes of the younger generation,

00:47:46.410 --> 00:47:51.940
that they were more familiar and had been
exposed to computers their entire life and

00:47:51.940 --> 00:47:56.549
probably had gotten more an education in
whatever computing sciences were appropriate

00:47:56.549 --> 00:47:59.610
then had their own generation.

00:47:59.610 --> 00:48:03.130
Many of whom
came out of school with all kinds of non computer

00:48:03.130 --> 00:48:06.569
related degrees and had to scramble a
bit to pick it up.

00:48:06.569 --> 00:48:10.299
So they were generally positive.

00:48:10.299 --> 00:48:16.769
And they didnít seem to suggest, well,
they suggested that it was gonna perhaps lead

00:48:16.769 --> 00:48:22.069
to a better work home life balance because
it

00:48:22.069 --> 00:48:27.509
was less likely than it had been in the generation
before that people would work 7 days a

00:48:27.509 --> 00:48:34.799
week, 18 hours a day until they dropped from
exhaustion at age 32 or 65 or whatever.

00:48:34.799 --> 00:48:37.900
But
aside from that I didnít hear anything.

00:48:37.900 --> 00:48:39.279
The other thing that was interesting, by the
way,

00:48:39.279 --> 00:48:44.040
just going into the broader area of change
when I say, ìWhat do you see in the future?î

00:48:44.040 --> 00:48:48.400
They all said, ìI would be crazy to make
a prediction about anything more than 18 months

00:48:48.400 --> 00:48:54.760
or 2 years in the future.î Whereas if I had
written this book 10 years ago, they all would

00:48:54.760 --> 00:48:59.490
have given me grand predictions about where
they thought technology was going and thatís

00:48:59.490 --> 00:49:04.710
probably because thatís what they were hearing
from IBM and Accenture and whoever.

00:49:04.710 --> 00:49:06.940
They
were so used to the idea that vendors will

00:49:06.940 --> 00:49:09.150
come talk to us and weíll tell them what
we

00:49:09.150 --> 00:49:13.259
need and theyíll tell us what theyíre doing
and so weíll be able to see 5 years into

00:49:13.259 --> 00:49:15.010
the
future and there were lots of 5 year plans,

00:49:15.010 --> 00:49:16.010
you know?

00:49:16.010 --> 00:49:17.010
&gt;&gt;Ben Fried: So to speak.

00:49:17.010 --> 00:49:18.410
&gt;&gt;Ed Yourden: Twenty years ago.

00:49:18.410 --> 00:49:20.829
And they werenít doing that this time around.

00:49:20.829 --> 00:49:21.829
So that was
encouraging.

00:49:21.829 --> 00:49:22.829
&gt;&gt;female #1: Okay, thanks.

00:49:22.829 --> 00:49:23.829
&gt;&gt;Ed Yourden: Sure.

00:49:23.829 --> 00:49:25.130
I think weíve got another question.

00:49:25.130 --> 00:49:26.630
&gt;&gt;Ben Fried: Yeah.

00:49:26.630 --> 00:49:28.130
&gt;&gt;male #3: Hi.

00:49:28.130 --> 00:49:33.550
First I wanna thank you for what you said
about Y2K in the 90s because it

00:49:33.550 --> 00:49:39.599
really, I think it kicked everyoneís butt
in a way that needed to happen and that people

00:49:39.599 --> 00:49:44.970
wouldnít have paid attention to the issue
if people werenít saying the things you were

00:49:44.970 --> 00:49:45.970
saying.

00:49:45.970 --> 00:49:47.160
&gt;&gt;Ed Yourden: Well, thank you but I took a
lot of heat for it.

00:49:47.160 --> 00:49:48.160
[Laughs]

00:49:48.160 --> 00:49:52.930
&gt;&gt;male #3: And thatís why I wanna give you
some gratitude cause I saw huge projects that

00:49:52.930 --> 00:49:57.990
were really needed and they wouldnít have
happened any other way.

00:49:57.990 --> 00:49:59.869
My question has nothing
to do with that though.

00:49:59.869 --> 00:50:04.980
I was wondering, you mentioned most CIOs tended
to fall into the

00:50:04.980 --> 00:50:10.660
field and obviously thereís no, you canít
go to college and major in CIOness

00:50:10.660 --> 00:50:11.660
[Laughter]

00:50:11.660 --> 00:50:18.619
&gt;&gt;male #3: But Iím concerned that so much
of the computing world is staffed by people

00:50:18.619 --> 00:50:22.390
that
fell into it and I was wondering, and the

00:50:22.390 --> 00:50:24.839
reason for that is, I think, computing is
becoming

00:50:24.839 --> 00:50:26.039
like the air we breathe.

00:50:26.039 --> 00:50:30.150
Itís very important or as important as healthcare.

00:50:30.150 --> 00:50:34.670
And Iíd rather
go to a doctor that followed a prescribed

00:50:34.670 --> 00:50:37.520
educational plan to become a doctor than one
that

00:50:37.520 --> 00:50:41.410
was kind of, you know, fooling around with
medicine in his home and decided to go into

00:50:41.410 --> 00:50:42.410
this
field.

00:50:42.410 --> 00:50:43.410
[Laughter]

00:50:43.410 --> 00:50:44.410
&gt;&gt;male #3: So

00:50:44.410 --> 00:50:45.410
[Clears throat]

00:50:45.410 --> 00:50:51.220
&gt;&gt;male #3: My point and I do have one, is
what do you see is needed in the educational

00:50:51.220 --> 00:50:55.140
field
for IT and computer science in the next 5

00:50:55.140 --> 00:50:56.220
or 10 years?

00:50:56.220 --> 00:50:57.300
&gt;&gt;Ed Yourden: Wow.

00:50:57.300 --> 00:51:00.640
Thatís another kind of philosophical question
that could keep us occupied

00:51:00.640 --> 00:51:03.109
all day.

00:51:03.109 --> 00:51:06.770
The fact that a lot of employers now feel
they have luxury of insisting on a

00:51:06.770 --> 00:51:10.960
computer science degree or a software engineering
degree itís certainly a radical change

00:51:10.960 --> 00:51:12.109
from when I entered the field.

00:51:12.109 --> 00:51:15.369
In fact, when I graduated from MIT, there
was no computer

00:51:15.369 --> 00:51:16.710
science degree.

00:51:16.710 --> 00:51:19.450
So employers said, ìMath?

00:51:19.450 --> 00:51:20.950
Electrical engineering?

00:51:20.950 --> 00:51:22.450
Mechanical engineering?

00:51:22.450 --> 00:51:26.079
Astrophysics, anything?î So that has changed.

00:51:26.079 --> 00:51:31.660
Now, they can say we wanna hire people from
this level of university with these kinds

00:51:31.660 --> 00:51:39.019
of recognized diplomas but within the academic
institutions themselves, there has been a

00:51:39.019 --> 00:51:41.880
lot of soul searching for the last 40 or 50
years

00:51:41.880 --> 00:51:47.549
at, ìWhat should we be teaching this year?î
ìIs it still relevant to teach language X

00:51:47.549 --> 00:51:49.920
given
that no one in the real world is using it

00:51:49.920 --> 00:51:52.940
anymore?î I think thatís gonna continue
as long as

00:51:52.940 --> 00:51:58.430
our technology continues changing as rapidly
as it does because itís very hard for the

00:51:58.430 --> 00:52:02.109
institutions to change that rapidly themselves.

00:52:02.109 --> 00:52:07.420
Thereís a deeper and more controversial
question behind what youíve asked, though,

00:52:07.420 --> 00:52:09.540
that I thought you were gonna get to and that
has

00:52:09.540 --> 00:52:13.150
to do with licensing of IT people.

00:52:13.150 --> 00:52:15.289
As I understand it, a doctor is not allowed
to practice

00:52:15.289 --> 00:52:21.710
unless heís not only gone through medical
school but also has a license of some sort,

00:52:21.710 --> 00:52:23.920
which
is true of a lot of fields, not software,

00:52:23.920 --> 00:52:24.920
not software.

00:52:24.920 --> 00:52:28.820
And I donít think thatís gonna
happen in our lifetime.

00:52:28.820 --> 00:52:35.089
&gt;&gt;male #3: We have certifications which are
taking that role at least for lower level

00:52:35.089 --> 00:52:37.099
positions, I think.

00:52:37.099 --> 00:52:42.990
&gt;&gt;Ed Yourden: Yeah, though, again we could
get into a long philosophical discussion.

00:52:42.990 --> 00:52:45.950
The
certification is, in some cases, a demonstration

00:52:45.950 --> 00:52:47.150
that you know how to use certain tools.

00:52:47.150 --> 00:52:52.170
You know, you can get a Microsoft certification
in all kinds of things that may not

00:52:52.170 --> 00:52:57.630
indicate whether or not you really know anything
about computing.

00:52:57.630 --> 00:52:59.411
As I understand it,
youíre not allowed to build a bridge or a

00:52:59.411 --> 00:53:04.549
building unless you have a license from some
engineering society that provides, at least,

00:53:04.549 --> 00:53:08.569
some confidence that it wonít fall down the
minute you finish building it and thatís

00:53:08.569 --> 00:53:12.980
not very much true in the computing field
at all.

00:53:12.980 --> 00:53:15.970
And there was no discussion of that, thatís
one of the questions I wish I had asked of

00:53:15.970 --> 00:53:18.869
the
CIO, do you think we should be insisting on

00:53:18.869 --> 00:53:21.450
licensing of computer people.

00:53:21.450 --> 00:53:23.080
Because I probably
wouldíve gotten a variety of answers.

00:53:23.080 --> 00:53:24.099
&gt;&gt;Ben Fried: Yeah.

00:53:24.099 --> 00:53:26.910
&gt;&gt;Ed Yourden: Iím not sure what it would
have been.

00:53:26.910 --> 00:53:28.849
&gt;&gt;male #3: Thank you.

00:53:28.849 --> 00:53:32.920
&gt;&gt;Ben Fried: So maybe a final, I think weíre
just about out of time, maybe a final question

00:53:32.920 --> 00:53:40.359
for you maybe in the philosophical realm as
well, but looking at, and so many people you

00:53:40.359 --> 00:53:45.089
interviewed identified consumerization of
IT as such a trend and if you look at so much

00:53:45.089 --> 00:53:48.640
of
the way of cloud computing and BYOD and kind

00:53:48.640 --> 00:53:53.640
of all the trends that were frequently
identified, I think it makes me want to ask

00:53:53.640 --> 00:53:56.690
the question of will IT be necessary?

00:53:56.690 --> 00:54:01.140
And I,
in 15 years, right, or will, for example if

00:54:01.140 --> 00:54:06.140
you wanted to have your own stealth salesforce
right now inside some company all you need

00:54:06.140 --> 00:54:10.280
is web browser to use salesforce and you could
use

00:54:10.280 --> 00:54:19.349
PayPal or whatever to, or Google wallet to
manage your, or Square or whatever, you can

00:54:19.349 --> 00:54:20.700
handle
payments in different ways.

00:54:20.700 --> 00:54:24.410
You could have CRM tools, you could name almost
any part of

00:54:24.410 --> 00:54:27.920
what you wanna do and you can just get access
to it all through a web browser without the

00:54:27.920 --> 00:54:31.140
IT
department having to do anything for you.

00:54:31.140 --> 00:54:35.559
And is the logical conclusion of this that
kind of

00:54:35.559 --> 00:54:42.059
the shores lick at more and more and more
of the sands IT leaving us a smaller and smaller

00:54:42.059 --> 00:54:45.589
island to
manage or defend that people need less and

00:54:45.589 --> 00:54:46.589
less from it?

00:54:46.589 --> 00:54:47.589
[Sigh]

00:54:47.589 --> 00:54:52.290
&gt;&gt;Ben Fried: Not that does technology go away
but does the notion that the department thatís

00:54:52.290 --> 00:54:56.730
responsible for technology, is that as dated
as like reading about terms like the motor

00:54:56.730 --> 00:54:58.339
pool
or something like that?

00:54:58.339 --> 00:54:59.859
&gt;&gt;Ed Yourden: It may be.

00:54:59.859 --> 00:55:01.489
It may be.

00:55:01.489 --> 00:55:03.960
I certainly think that technology is gonna
become more

00:55:03.960 --> 00:55:07.960
and more diffused through every aspect of
our company.

00:55:07.960 --> 00:55:10.900
I, very much like the gentleman over
here was saying, itís almost part of the

00:55:10.900 --> 00:55:14.240
air we breathe these days.

00:55:14.240 --> 00:55:22.519
But I think that we may not
need programming and coding and a lot of the

00:55:22.519 --> 00:55:25.580
traditional technology aspects of IT but we
are

00:55:25.580 --> 00:55:32.680
still building systems that are very large
and very interconnected that, I think, itís

00:55:32.680 --> 00:55:35.660
gonna
require reasonably smart people to figure

00:55:35.660 --> 00:55:39.839
out if you scale them up.

00:55:39.839 --> 00:55:42.150
Just like we need very
smart people to build the tools in the first

00:55:42.150 --> 00:55:47.970
place, you know, if Iíve got a company with
a

00:55:47.970 --> 00:55:52.500
hundred regional offices all using salesforce,
I would probably still need some systems

00:55:52.500 --> 00:56:00.400
level thinking to figure out how best to fit
all that together even if I donít need any

00:56:00.400 --> 00:56:03.109
Cobalt programmers to write the underlying
code.

00:56:03.109 --> 00:56:04.109
[Laughs]

00:56:04.109 --> 00:56:09.359
&gt;&gt;Ed Yourden: But I think, thatís probably
another question that I should have asked

00:56:09.359 --> 00:56:11.309
and I
suspect that the typical CIO would be very

00:56:11.309 --> 00:56:13.690
much against that because youíre talking
about

00:56:13.690 --> 00:56:17.349
his or her job going away.

00:56:17.349 --> 00:56:22.950
I asked a little bit of that question, I remember,
of Lynne Ellen

00:56:22.950 --> 00:56:27.489
is her name, the woman who was, until recently,
the CIO of Detroit Energy.

00:56:27.489 --> 00:56:31.920
I said, ìIsnít
it true that you get people coming out of

00:56:31.920 --> 00:56:36.269
college today thinking that they know everything
about software engineering because they know

00:56:36.269 --> 00:56:38.740
Excel?î Or no, she was the one that used
the

00:56:38.740 --> 00:56:44.240
Excel metaphor but I said, you know, ìDo
they have an over confidence about their technical

00:56:44.240 --> 00:56:48.099
skills?î And she was the one that said, ìJust
because you know Excel doesnít mean you know

00:56:48.099 --> 00:56:53.640
software engineering.î And she said we try
to throw a lot of our younger graduates into

00:56:53.640 --> 00:56:58.930
complex situations knowing that theyíre going
to sink but hopefully giving them the

00:56:58.930 --> 00:57:02.210
opportunity to learn that things are a lot
more complicated than they think.

00:57:02.210 --> 00:57:03.970
&gt;&gt;Ben Fried: Scaring them straight, kind of?

00:57:03.970 --> 00:57:04.970
&gt;&gt;Ed Yourden: Yeah.

00:57:04.970 --> 00:57:05.970
[Laughter]

00:57:05.970 --> 00:57:10.930
&gt;&gt;Ben Fried: Yeah, sorry I think that, I think
weíre out of time.
