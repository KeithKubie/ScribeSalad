00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.671
- [Voiceover] Grammarians,
we're gonna talk about

00:00:01.671 --> 00:00:04.434
relative pronouns today
and what relative pronouns

00:00:04.434 --> 00:00:06.594
do is they link clauses together,

00:00:06.594 --> 00:00:09.276
specifically, independent
and dependent clauses,

00:00:09.276 --> 00:00:11.714
and if you don't know what independent

00:00:11.714 --> 00:00:12.934
and dependent clauses are, that's okay,

00:00:12.934 --> 00:00:16.428
just, suffice it to say,
that these pronouns allow you

00:00:16.428 --> 00:00:19.182
to staple phrases together.

00:00:19.182 --> 00:00:22.238
For example, in the sentence,
the man who sold the world

00:00:22.238 --> 00:00:24.591
is coming by on Tuesday, the pronoun who,

00:00:24.591 --> 00:00:27.271
is the relative pronoun there,

00:00:27.271 --> 00:00:28.908
it's linking the independent clause,

00:00:28.908 --> 00:00:30.695
the man is coming by on Tuesday

00:00:30.695 --> 00:00:33.901
to the dependent clause, sold the world.

00:00:33.901 --> 00:00:38.475
The relative pronouns of
English are who, whom,

00:00:38.475 --> 00:00:42.747
whose, that and which, and we use them all

00:00:42.747 --> 00:00:44.984
for different things.

00:00:44.984 --> 00:00:47.972
So, we can use who, whom, whose and that

00:00:47.972 --> 00:00:52.232
to refer to people, and we can use

00:00:52.232 --> 00:00:57.158
whose, that and which to refer to things.

00:00:57.158 --> 00:00:59.551
Let me show you.

00:00:59.551 --> 00:01:03.477
You could say, the salad
that I bought was wilted.

00:01:03.477 --> 00:01:06.094
But at the same time, I can
also use that in this sentence.

00:01:06.094 --> 00:01:08.195
The man that I saw smiled.

00:01:08.195 --> 00:01:09.833
See, I'm using that to refer to him.

00:01:09.833 --> 00:01:12.689
I could also use who, but the word which,

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:16.388
however, does not play
very nicely with people.

00:01:16.388 --> 00:01:19.493
In the sentence, the witch
who cast the spell is kind,

00:01:19.493 --> 00:01:22.975
we could use either the
witch who cast the spell

00:01:22.975 --> 00:01:25.450
or the witch that cast the spell because

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:27.968
both that and who work with people.

00:01:27.968 --> 00:01:30.556
But which, strangely, does not.

00:01:30.556 --> 00:01:32.915
So we couldn't say, for example, the witch

00:01:32.915 --> 00:01:35.329
which owns a cat is cruel.

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:38.056
That's just now how
the language shook out,

00:01:38.056 --> 00:01:42.731
which is not a relative
pronoun that applies to people.

00:01:44.851 --> 00:01:47.408
These are the relative
pronouns of English,

00:01:47.408 --> 00:01:49.263
this is broadly how
they work and I'm gonna

00:01:49.263 --> 00:01:52.467
get into more specifics
in following videos.

00:01:52.467 --> 00:01:54.825
You can learn anything, David out.
