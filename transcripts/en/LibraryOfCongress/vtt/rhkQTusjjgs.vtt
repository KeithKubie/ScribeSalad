00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:03.970
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.210
&gt;&gt; Hirad Dinavari: I want
to apologize a little bit

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:25.900
because of the little
chaotic nature.

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.850 position:56%
Sometimes we've got technical
issues, and it's out of our control.

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:32.280
Usually we have two screens but for
some reason today we were not able

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:33.700
to get two screens hooked up.

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:35.220
So feel cozy.

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:36.520
Get closer.

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:37.820
Move closer if you'd like to.

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:39.120
There's only one screen.

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.530
This is a high-tech presentation
which means there's a lot

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.560
of audio and video involved.

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:48.480
And so you probably don't want
to miss any of the video clips.

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:54.370
So I want to extend welcome
to everyone who bothered

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:58.460
to make time on, during the
week, during lunch hour.

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:00.770
I know that it's difficult
to get to the library,

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:02.380
and it's not the easiest
thing to get here.

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:03.680
And what a turn out.

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:04.980
Fantastic!

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:09.330
And on behalf of Mary Jane
[inaudible] and Joan Weeks,

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.300
the head of the Near East,
I want to welcome you.

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:15.270
Unfortunately, both of
them are away, not here.

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.590
This is the African and
Middle Eastern division.

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:21.640
We have three sections
here: the Hebraic Section,

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:25.630
which focuses on Judaica and
Hebrew and all materials that have

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:27.470
to do with Semitic languages.

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:32.450 position:56%
The Near East Section, which focuses
on all the Arab world countries,

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:38.100
Arabic language around the
world, and Iranic languages from,

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:44.050 position:56%
of course, Persian, Pashto, Kurdish,
and other Iranian languages as well

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:48.640
as Turkic languages, all the way
from Central Asia and Western China

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.890
to the Caucuses, as well as the
Caucasian peoples, the Armenians,

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.190
the Georgians, and
other Caucuses peoples.

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:56.490
It's a big division.

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.890
We represent over 80
something countries.

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:03.230
And of course we have the African
Section here, also as well.

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:05.370 position:56%
Which deals with Sub-Saharan Africa.

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:06.670
It's a huge division.

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:11.020
I'm hoping this will inspire
you to come visit us and take

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:13.490
in other collections
that we have to offer.

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:18.210 position:56%
Without taking too much time, I
want to say that this a continuation

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:21.850
of our Persian Book Lecture
Series, something that we started

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:25.860
with the University of
Maryland, with Fatemeh Keshavarz,

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.950
essentially The Roshan
Institute for Persian Studies,

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.910
and it's an ongoing partnership
that's been very fruitful,

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:35.390
that's been very rewarding.

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:38.190
And we've had a number of
very interesting lectures

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:42.140
that are fully filmed,
just like this program is.

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.490
And the good thing is once
they're filmed, they're put online

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:48.630 position:56%
and will be there forever for people
to use, for students to look at,

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:52.890
for teachers to utilize, and I
see it as an electronic resource.

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:56.430
So without taking too
much time, I really would

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:00.910
like to give Fatemeh Keshavarz
an opportunity to come up here

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:05.510
and say a word or two about Roshan,
and introduce our lovely speaker,

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:12.440 position:56%
Ida Meftahi, who is giving us a
lecture on gender and dance in Iran.

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:14.290
Again, thank you very
much for joining us.

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:16.510
Fatemeh Keshavarz,
[foreign language].

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:21.040
[ Applause ]

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:22.340
&gt;&gt; Fatemeh Keshavarz:
Thank you, thank you.

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:23.640
Welcome, everybody.

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:28.590
I can see there are classes
coming in with Dr. Akbari, so I'm,

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:32.060
I'm delighted that they'll be
here in time for the lecture.

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:34.660
Yes, indeed, this is a,
this is a great turnout.

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:37.590
And we're really grateful
for everyone making the time

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:39.360
in the middle of the day to come.

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:45.460
As Hirad pointed out, we have
had a very fruitful collaboration

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:48.680
which started, and actually,
it started before I was here

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:53.510
with my colleague, Dr. Ahmad
Karimi-Hakkak, here with us today.

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:57.060
[ Applause ]

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:59.870
Yes, so there were other things
happening before I was here,

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:01.270
but we did work on it.

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:02.570
We, we added.

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:07.180
We had a major exhibit which was
visited by about a million people.

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:11.250
And then we had speaker series,
and now we're continuing,

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:13.290
and we hopefully, I
mean it's turning

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:18.080
into a tradition that's
clearly worth continuing.

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:21.910
Roshan Institute, as you all
know, is dedicated to the study

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:25.040
of Persian culture,
language, and literature.

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:27.600
And so our collaboration
with the Library

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.830
of Congress is very, very natural.

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:33.220
But it has been tremendously
rewarding.

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:37.110
And I cannot thank
enough Hirad and Mary Jane

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:38.900
and all their colleagues here.

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:43.540
Let me just quickly say a couple
words about Dr. Ida Meftahi,

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:46.260
our illustrious speaker today.

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:49.170
Ida's been with us for
the past three years.

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:51.290
We hope it will be
many, many more years

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:56.770
as Visiting Assistant Professor
of History and Persian Studies.

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:01.360
She has been basically
teaching Modern Iran

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:05.900
and has created a really, really
a sensation among the students.

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:08.820
I realize that word has
negative connotations,

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:12.810 position:56%
but in a very positive sense, people
want to learn about present-day Iran

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:17.500
and that's because she's been
connecting them with the culture.

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:20.430
The visual culture as
well as entertainment.

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:23.880
As well as basically everyday life.

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:26.670
Ida did help [inaudible]
University of Toronto

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:30.910
with Professor Mohammad Tavakoli,
himself a very original mind,

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:33.590
a very wonderful scholar
of modern Iran.

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:36.290
I'm sure many of you are
familiar with his work.

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:39.990
And Ida worked on gender and dance,

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:44.850
but it was really a much more
complex study of political economy

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:48.190
of Iran and the way
the economy of politics

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:52.150
and performance could
give us a special window

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:55.250
into understanding the
version of modernity

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:58.960
that Iranians crafted
for themselves.

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:02.590
So without further ado,
please welcome Dr. Ida Meftahi

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:05.510
for this presentation today.

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:08.040
[ Applause ]

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:09.990
&gt;&gt; Hirad Dinavari: I also want to
say that this is a book signing,

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:12.590
so we have copies of the
book that she's worked

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:15.060
so diligently on in the back.

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:19.160 position:56%
At the end of the program, feel free
to stop by the gentleman in the back

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:22.350
over there from our bookstore who
is selling copies of her book.

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:25.390
Thank you, again, Ida,
[foreign language].

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:44.770
&gt;&gt; Ida Meftahi: Thank
you very much, Hirad,

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:47.250
Dr. Keshavarz, for
your introduction.

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:51.280
And for facilitating this event.

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:54.890
Greetings, everyone, and thank you
very much for being here today.

00:06:54.890 --> 00:06:58.880
It's truly a pleasure to be
speaking about my first book

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:00.460
at this remarkable place.

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:04.970
And for such a wonderful audience.

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:11.200
As in the case of many first books,

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:15.310
or [inaudible] dissertations
revising to first book,

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:20.550
Gender and Dance in Modern Iran
has a personal story behind it.

00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:23.030
Mine starts with I was 12

00:07:23.030 --> 00:07:26.420
when my mother first
took me to a dance class.

00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:31.140
She hoped that dancing would
cure my extreme shyness.

00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:35.620
This is quite a universal story for
many performers around the world,

00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:40.760
but perhaps not a very imaginable
one for an accented Iranian woman

00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:45.640
who has spent most of her life
in post-revolutionary Iran.

00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:50.840
A place not always imagined as
a dance-cultivating environment.

00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:53.440
In fact, it's largely
believed that all forms

00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:55.970
of dance are prohibited in Iran.

00:07:58.140 --> 00:08:02.280
My first teacher, teachers,
they were elderly Armenian women

00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:07.590
who taught me a variety of
dances including Caucasian,

00:08:07.590 --> 00:08:13.440 position:56%
[inaudible] Persian, as well as paso
doble, tango, cha-cha, and waltz,

00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:17.300
a peculiar repertoire
for a teenager.

00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:22.440
When Iraq was bombing Iran,
I was rehearsing dance.

00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:26.590
These classes inspired me and
really didn't cure my shyness.

00:08:26.590 --> 00:08:31.110
I still struggle with it to
this day, but I had to stop them

00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:32.790
for a while to concentrate,

00:08:32.790 --> 00:08:36.670
concentrate on preparing
for university exams.

00:08:36.670 --> 00:08:40.790
A few days after the
university exams,

00:08:40.790 --> 00:08:43.940
my caring mother took me
to a second dance class.

00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:52.150
This time with the former
soloist of National,

00:08:52.150 --> 00:08:56.110
of Iran's Pre-Revolutionary
State Dance Company,

00:08:56.110 --> 00:09:00.720
and one of the strongest and most
inspiring and passionate women

00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:04.920
of my country, and a
true dance goddess.

00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:10.060
Taught in private in settings,
her classes are for women only.

00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:14.640
Within a few years, my teacher
came up with a particular style

00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:20.250
of choreography for me that suited
my relatively depressed character.

00:09:20.250 --> 00:09:24.870
And I became hooked
on into this style.

00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:29.530
I dedicatedly spent hours every day
rehearsing dance while also being a

00:09:29.530 --> 00:09:34.580
university student in a
drastically different world.

00:09:34.580 --> 00:09:39.210
By late 1990s, the environment
was gradually opening up.

00:09:39.210 --> 00:09:46.450
And we got several opportunities
to perform at women-only concerts

00:09:46.450 --> 00:09:48.740 position:56%
in front of a few hundred audiences.

00:09:48.740 --> 00:09:57.390 position:56%
And as you can see in these
images, we were quite well organized

00:09:57.390 --> 00:10:00.510
and well dressed for the situation.

00:10:00.510 --> 00:10:05.890
And in one of the pictures,
you can see her,

00:10:05.890 --> 00:10:08.880
the way she has been
received by all these flowers.

00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:16.920
In all her events, still to this
day she receives so many flowers!

00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:23.540
In the meantime, after
several years of practice,

00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:27.780
I had developed many questions
about the history of dance in Iran,

00:10:27.780 --> 00:10:30.770
especially the one we
practiced, the [foreign language],

00:10:30.770 --> 00:10:34.870
known as Iranian National Dance.

00:10:34.870 --> 00:10:40.700
As neither the genre title,
nor the little information

00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:44.300
that I was given was
convincing, I began dreaming

00:10:44.300 --> 00:10:46.980
of pursing scholarly
research on dance

00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:49.440
if I was ever given the chance.

00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:53.340
I dreamed of writing a
book about Iranian dance.

00:10:53.340 --> 00:10:58.220
I left Iran for Canada in 2000,
with my very supportive husband,

00:10:58.220 --> 00:11:00.790
who is sitting in the audience.

00:11:00.790 --> 00:11:04.570
And by 2003, I had found my
way to the Master's Program

00:11:04.570 --> 00:11:07.700
in Dance Studies at York
University in Toronto.

00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:10.870
Under the supervision of
Canada's leading dance historian,

00:11:10.870 --> 00:11:16.230
Dr. Selma Odom, I graduated
with a historical thesis titled,

00:11:16.230 --> 00:11:21.790
An Examination of Writings on
Dance in Iran from 1930 to 1980,

00:11:21.790 --> 00:11:25.170
in which I examined numerous
periodicals with the hope

00:11:25.170 --> 00:11:29.470
of connecting scattered
informations.

00:11:29.470 --> 00:11:35.030
Immediately after this degree, I
started the Ph.D. at the University

00:11:35.030 --> 00:11:39.020
of Toronto, and as Dr. Keshavarz
mentioned, I was lucky enough

00:11:39.020 --> 00:11:43.970
to have Dr. Tavakoli
as my supervisor.

00:11:47.310 --> 00:11:50.980
As I became increasingly
absorbed in my archival

00:11:50.980 --> 00:11:55.830
and [inaudible] research,
my dance colleagues

00:11:55.830 --> 00:11:58.000
in Iran became further involved

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:03.800
in a rapidly growing public
post-revolutionary movement based

00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:06.450
on [inaudible] known
as [foreign language].

00:12:06.450 --> 00:12:15.680 position:56%
As I discussed in chapters seven
and eight of my book, this new genre

00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:19.210
which emerged from the
theatrical scene only a few years

00:12:19.210 --> 00:12:23.760
after the revolution was
indeed genealogically related

00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:27.830
to the National Dance genre,
but of course with modifications

00:12:27.830 --> 00:12:33.560
in the title, dance movements,
and appearance of the dancers.

00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:37.580
Then in 2000, its founders, all

00:12:37.580 --> 00:12:41.650
from the revolutionary-dissolved
state dance companies,

00:12:41.650 --> 00:12:44.150
pushed forth [inaudible]
performances.

00:12:44.150 --> 00:12:50.860 position:56%
With these negotiations between
resilient performers and a difficult

00:12:50.860 --> 00:12:56.060
and yet mutable regulations of
the Islamized theatrical stage,

00:12:56.060 --> 00:13:01.930 position:56%
the genre provided the opportunity
for underground, underground dancers

00:13:01.930 --> 00:13:06.560
to perform publicly and
get paid for their work.

00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:10.530
I was amazed by these new
developments, and to be honest,

00:13:10.530 --> 00:13:17.070
as a dance practitioner in
Canada, sometimes I envied them.

00:13:17.070 --> 00:13:21.600
It was easier to dance with
limitations than be the subject

00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:26.600
of stereotypes about Middle
Eastern women on daily basis.

00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:30.340
Yes, I'm from Iran, and
no, I'm not a belly dancer.

00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:34.980
This was the phrase I
repeated numerous times

00:13:34.980 --> 00:13:38.300
in every introductory situation.

00:13:38.300 --> 00:13:42.270
After years of practice, I
finally admitted my defeat

00:13:42.270 --> 00:13:47.780
to Canada's multicultural
artistic scene and gave up dancing.

00:13:47.780 --> 00:13:53.870
Instead, I dedicated all my time
and energy to pursuing my research,

00:13:53.870 --> 00:13:56.970
which by itself was
quite challenging.

00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:09.370
In the absence of scholarly sources
on this topic, I had to rely mainly

00:14:09.370 --> 00:14:13.780
on analysis of primary sources,
including the discourse on dance

00:14:13.780 --> 00:14:17.220
in periodicals with various
ideological inclinations,

00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:25.050
including Nationalist, Marxist, and
Islamic, interviews with artists,

00:14:25.050 --> 00:14:30.030 position:56%
performance [inaudible], audiovisual
sources including video footage

00:14:30.030 --> 00:14:32.340
of dance and cinematic productions,

00:14:32.340 --> 00:14:36.360
and archival documents
of official nature.

00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:40.110 position:56%
Connecting the sociopolitical
discourse on dance, music, theaters,

00:14:40.110 --> 00:14:44.250
cinema and popular culture with
this stage dancing body as well

00:14:44.250 --> 00:14:48.890
as the economic and regulatory
conditions that govern the stage.

00:14:48.890 --> 00:14:54.050
I had to come up with a
historical narrative about Iran,

00:14:54.050 --> 00:14:58.420
the dancing body, to trace
the ways it was shaped

00:14:58.420 --> 00:15:01.850
and transformed throughout
the century.

00:15:01.850 --> 00:15:05.990
This narrative, I argue, also
reflects the corporeal history

00:15:05.990 --> 00:15:13.030
of urban Iranian women, of
course, in the modern era.

00:15:13.030 --> 00:15:17.710 position:56%
Conducting archival work in Iran
had its own difficulties as the term

00:15:17.710 --> 00:15:22.740
"raghs" or dance was not commonly
used in the official settings.

00:15:22.740 --> 00:15:27.970
So I needed to improvise and
find ways to convey it when I was

00:15:27.970 --> 00:15:30.370
in a library or an archive.

00:15:30.370 --> 00:15:34.490
Which sometimes resulted
in humorous situations.

00:15:34.490 --> 00:15:39.560
Despite these challenges, I have to
confess that I met many people open

00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:43.110
to the idea of my research
in Iran than let's say some

00:15:43.110 --> 00:15:47.440
of our Middle Eastern Studies
colleagues outside Iran.

00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:52.100
By 2010, I knew that one genre

00:15:52.100 --> 00:15:57.350
on perhaps one cultural category
was missing from my research.

00:15:57.350 --> 00:16:04.160
This was the genre that as a
performer I was supposed not

00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:07.870
to get too close to
as the cabaret dancer.

00:16:14.730 --> 00:16:20.090
Sorry, was -- and that was the
pre-revolutionary cabaret dancing.

00:16:20.090 --> 00:16:23.300
This was the genre that as a
performer I was supposed not

00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:27.940
to get close to, as the cabaret
dancer represented the other,

00:16:27.940 --> 00:16:31.360
the vulgar, and the sexualized.

00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:37.310
Stating that it's simply not the
high art genre of national dance

00:16:37.310 --> 00:16:41.710
and invented 20th century
the choreographic genre

00:16:41.710 --> 00:16:45.200
which I actually explore in
my, in chapter two of my book,

00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:52.210
traced its trajectory to a glorious
past as far as ancient Iran.

00:16:52.210 --> 00:16:58.520
I had learned to block out the
cabaret dancer uninhibitedly.

00:16:58.520 --> 00:17:03.670
Aesthetically and morally, I
assumed that she wasn't worthy

00:17:03.670 --> 00:17:08.290
of serious scholarly
examination, but on the other hand,

00:17:08.290 --> 00:17:12.700
how could I ignore her when
she was the most dominant

00:17:12.700 --> 00:17:16.350
and visible character
of 20th century Iran?

00:17:16.350 --> 00:17:18.640
Dance character of
20th century Iran?

00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:21.410
She was present in
periodicals, novels,

00:17:21.410 --> 00:17:24.980
and pre-revolutionary
commercial cinema, but was always

00:17:24.980 --> 00:17:29.170
as a morally dubious character.

00:17:29.170 --> 00:17:33.560
I finally decided to tackle this
topic, and I have to be honest,

00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:36.800
my advisor also pushed
me to do that.

00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:45.930
But was always, and I
have to confess again

00:17:45.930 --> 00:17:50.200
that I believe this topic became
the most important contribution

00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:52.500
of my research.

00:18:01.150 --> 00:18:04.900
Just to give you an idea of how
the cabaret dancer was depicted

00:18:04.900 --> 00:18:08.990
in films prior to the revolution, I
would like you to watch the trailer

00:18:08.990 --> 00:18:14.120
of the 1970 film, The City's
Dancer, Raqqasah'i Shahr.

00:18:14.120 --> 00:18:16.440 position:56%
While watching, please pay attention

00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:21.670
to the leading female
role, [inaudible].

00:18:21.670 --> 00:18:24.510
And hopefully --

00:18:24.510 --> 00:19:23.170
[ Video Inaudible ]

00:19:23.170 --> 00:19:25.600
Perhaps many of you are familiar

00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:29.400
with such stereotypical
portrayal of [inaudible].

00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:31.320
But who was she really?

00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:35.860
And as a researcher, how could I
answer this question three decades

00:19:35.860 --> 00:19:40.780
after the demise of cabaret dance
as a consequence of the revolution

00:19:40.780 --> 00:19:45.650
when every available
evidence was against her?

00:19:45.650 --> 00:19:50.720
In summer of 2011,
after a year of search,

00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:54.890
a miracle interview
changed the situation.

00:19:54.890 --> 00:19:58.600
When to a theater actor,
I was introduced to a lady

00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:01.600
who I was told used to
be a cabaret dancer.

00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:07.680
It was rare to find someone to
admit this occupation in Iran.

00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:11.890 position:56%
During our several hours of
interview, which led to another one,

00:20:11.890 --> 00:20:16.650
so defied all the stereotypes of
a cabaret dancer as she proved

00:20:16.650 --> 00:20:20.160
to be a multifaceted performer.

00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:23.670
She repeatedly expressed her
grief for the gradual demise

00:20:23.670 --> 00:20:27.720
of the former theater
district of Iran, Lalehzar.

00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:33.340 position:56%
Which she described as, quote, "the
most, the mother of Iranian theater,

00:20:33.340 --> 00:20:36.010
all great actors of
Iran have been trained

00:20:36.010 --> 00:20:38.800
and have performed in Lalehzar.

00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:42.630
We were taught by our masters
to respect the theater's stage

00:20:42.630 --> 00:20:47.710
as stage is a school for
the audiences," end-quote.

00:20:47.710 --> 00:20:53.930
There are a section of the stage as
a school of morality was familiar

00:20:53.930 --> 00:20:55.930
to me as it was a common notion

00:20:55.930 --> 00:21:01.830
in the Nationalists Performing Art
discourse of 20th century Iran.

00:21:04.090 --> 00:21:08.250
But it was unclear as to how
an actress, who was brought

00:21:08.250 --> 00:21:12.320
up to perceive the stage as a
school of morality became involved

00:21:12.320 --> 00:21:14.710
in cabaret dancing, an occupation

00:21:14.710 --> 00:21:19.620
that for decades has symbolized
immoralities and social corruption

00:21:19.620 --> 00:21:22.030
under the [inaudible] state.

00:21:22.030 --> 00:21:28.080
After spending several years
examining historical accounts

00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:30.910
on theater and cinema,
watching dozens of films

00:21:30.910 --> 00:21:35.680
and having more conversations
with a few more, other performers,

00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:38.260
I found an answer to this question.

00:21:38.260 --> 00:21:44.050
Here I would like to briefly
show some of these findings.

00:21:44.050 --> 00:21:47.100
The cabaret dancer, whom
I hear sometimes referred

00:21:47.100 --> 00:21:50.880
to as [inaudible] was
associated with and participated

00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:54.750
in multiple [inaudible],
particularly in Tehran,

00:21:54.750 --> 00:22:00.870
namely the traditional
minstrel [inaudible],

00:22:00.870 --> 00:22:06.080
and traditional here is kind
of under question for me.

The [inaudible] theatrical scene

00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:13.880
of post-1950s pre-revolutionary
commercial cinema as well

00:22:13.880 --> 00:22:16.510
as the prostitution realm.

00:22:16.510 --> 00:22:21.800
While different in nature, it's
important to note and in ending --

00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:26.270
that in the construction and
[inaudible] of urban culture

00:22:26.270 --> 00:22:34.780
in 20th century, all
of these spheres fall

00:22:34.780 --> 00:22:39.270
into the categories of low.

00:22:39.270 --> 00:22:43.340
For instance, when they
categorize, when cultural,

00:22:43.340 --> 00:22:47.640
in the cultural categories
of high versus low,

00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:49.660
[inaudible] versus degenerate,

00:22:49.660 --> 00:22:52.700
modern versus unmodern
or traditional.

00:22:52.700 --> 00:22:56.570
All of these fell into the second
category and were considered

00:22:56.570 --> 00:23:02.280
to be low, unmodern,
and signifies of vice

00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:04.580

00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:19.750
Perhaps the most important
arena which prior

00:23:19.750 --> 00:23:22.670
to the 20th century involved
dance in Iran was the

00:23:22.670 --> 00:23:25.130
"mutrib" or the minstrel scene.

00:23:25.130 --> 00:23:30.140

which featured the female
[inaudible] as a member,

combined music, dance, acting, and
comedy and their hire to perform

in various public and
private functions.

00:23:43.070 --> 00:23:48.780 position:56%
After the unveiling of 1937, mutribs
also recruited women to perform

00:23:48.780 --> 00:23:53.640
with them as actors and dancers,
replacing the transvestites

00:23:53.640 --> 00:23:55.510
and [inaudible] of
the [inaudible] era,

00:23:55.510 --> 00:23:59.850

dancer standing

in this [inaudible]
era mutribi troupe.

00:24:04.390 --> 00:24:09.490
This added to the stigma
that they had inherited

00:24:09.490 --> 00:24:12.430
from their predecessors
as illiterate,

00:24:12.430 --> 00:24:15.450
dissolute alcoholic
and drug addicts.

00:24:15.450 --> 00:24:19.190
Nevertheless, it was natural
for those women who were born

00:24:19.190 --> 00:24:24.780 position:56%
in mutribi families and for mutribs'
spouses to become performers,

00:24:24.780 --> 00:24:31.510
as it was a familially-constituted
occupation.

theatrical scene after 1950,

00:24:45.890 --> 00:24:50.450
an era recognized to most
committed theater historians

00:24:50.450 --> 00:24:52.710
as the demise of Lalehzar.

00:24:52.710 --> 00:24:57.200
In fact, it's her presence
that signifies the demise

00:24:57.200 --> 00:24:59.510
in most historical narratives.

00:24:59.510 --> 00:25:04.180
As I discussed in chapter three of
my book, this so-called demise came

00:25:04.180 --> 00:25:10.970
after a golden age of
freedom political expression.

00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:16.280

by theater activities

This side of a golden age of theater
in Iran was ascribed to the era

between the abdication of
[inaudible] and the coup.

00:25:46.580 --> 00:25:52.640
Even before this golden age, the
Lalehzar district had a reputation

00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:57.410
for cosmopolitan artistic
experimentation with the ideas

00:25:57.410 --> 00:26:00.080
of modernity and nationhood.

00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:07.090
For a number of reasons,
which I discuss in my book,

00:26:07.090 --> 00:26:13.100
after 1950 the private sector
of Lalehzar theater both status

00:26:13.100 --> 00:26:18.450
as a center for high-art cultural
production and its typical elite

00:26:18.450 --> 00:26:20.780
or middle class audience.

00:26:20.780 --> 00:26:26.460
In this time of economic hardship,
the manager of Tehran Theater,

00:26:26.460 --> 00:26:31.030 position:56%
which was the largest theater at the
time, located at Lalehzar Street,

00:26:31.030 --> 00:26:34.330
hired some foreign
dancers to perform

00:26:34.330 --> 00:26:38.480
in segments called
atraksiun or attraction.

00:26:39.750 --> 00:26:43.900
Following him, other
theater owners hired dancers,

00:26:43.900 --> 00:26:49.740
and atraksiun became prevalent
and later took over Lalehzar.

00:26:49.740 --> 00:26:53.570
While economically, dancers
helped the financial shortcomings,

00:26:53.570 --> 00:26:58.790
the idea of naked dancers in
Lalehzar raised new moral issues

00:26:58.790 --> 00:27:02.580
and reactions from the
artistic community.

bans performances

dominated the atraksiun scene.

00:27:19.060 --> 00:27:23.120
As dancing paid better than
acting, way better in fact,

00:27:23.120 --> 00:27:28.290 position:56%
some Lalehzar actresses including my
above-mentioned interviewees joined

00:27:28.290 --> 00:27:30.590
the atraksiun scene.

00:27:34.060 --> 00:27:35.630
The main arena of activity

00:27:35.630 --> 00:27:40.150
for raqqas however was Tehran's
nightlife which had been expanding

00:27:40.150 --> 00:27:45.990 position:56%
since 1940s when a number of cafes
and cabarets opened in various parts

00:27:45.990 --> 00:27:49.470
of Tehran, including
the Lalehzar district.

00:27:49.470 --> 00:27:54.340
As I discuss in chapter four of
my book, why the term [inaudible]

00:27:54.340 --> 00:27:58.840
and [inaudible], terms
[inaudible] appeared together,

00:27:58.840 --> 00:28:04.850
these spaces differed greatly in
terms of the quality of performance

00:28:04.850 --> 00:28:08.080
and the price of food
and alcohol as well

00:28:08.080 --> 00:28:09.440
as the class of their [inaudible].

00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:15.340
When Tehran's nightlife
was expanding in the 1950s,

00:28:15.340 --> 00:28:21.200
two groups of women were competing
for this newly-created occupation,

00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:26.450
foreign dancers who performed
at hotels and theaters,

00:28:26.450 --> 00:28:33.140
and those Iranian women who dared
to set foot on stage to perform

00:28:33.140 --> 00:28:37.010
in the locus of everyone's
attention.

00:28:37.010 --> 00:28:39.590
Perhaps some of these
women, including those

00:28:39.590 --> 00:28:41.570
from the mutribi troupes or those

00:28:41.570 --> 00:28:44.250
who were [inaudible]
theater practitioners had a

00:28:44.250 --> 00:28:45.740
performance background.

00:28:45.740 --> 00:28:50.820
But the majority of the early
cabaret dancers had no expertise

00:28:50.820 --> 00:28:53.790
other than their home-based,

00:28:53.790 --> 00:28:57.600
familial-setting solo improvised
dance or [foreign language]

00:28:57.600 --> 00:29:02.190
that Iranians do in parties.

00:29:02.190 --> 00:29:06.620
So these new performers had to
train themselves in a variety

00:29:06.620 --> 00:29:11.550
of trendy genres including
Indian, Arabic, Spanish,

00:29:11.550 --> 00:29:15.500
and even American dance
while watching films

00:29:15.500 --> 00:29:17.390
as well as each other.

00:29:17.390 --> 00:29:21.800
So I'm just going to show you
some video clips of these dancers,

00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:27.510
and I assume that this
is American dance.

00:29:27.510 --> 00:30:22.040
[ Inaudible Video ]

00:30:22.040 --> 00:30:25.720
Under the guise of elaborate
stage names such as [inaudible],

00:30:25.720 --> 00:30:30.920
and Princess, the dancers
traveled from one venue to another

00:30:30.920 --> 00:30:35.060
and presented themselves, their
act, and their dance styles,

00:30:35.060 --> 00:30:40.170 position:56%
according to the venues' regulations
and the audiences' expectations.

00:30:40.170 --> 00:30:43.650
As the dancers age,
beauty, on-stage behavior,

00:30:43.650 --> 00:30:50.400 position:56%
and outfit also contributed to their
reception, they were subjugated

00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:51.790
by their employers'

00:30:51.790 --> 00:30:58.270
to some disciplinary corporeal
criteria including obligatory

00:30:58.270 --> 00:31:01.490
revealing clothing.

00:31:01.490 --> 00:31:05.300
Some employers also
enforced off-stage activities

00:31:05.300 --> 00:31:09.920
on their performances, performers
by selling their customers to try

00:31:09.920 --> 00:31:12.720
to drink with the dancers,

00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:14.530
the custom that was
called [foreign language].

00:31:14.530 --> 00:31:19.890
This also could imply
that the dancer had agreed

00:31:19.890 --> 00:31:24.240
to an official contract
that required her to meet

00:31:24.240 --> 00:31:28.250
with the male customer outside
of the performance venue.

00:31:28.250 --> 00:31:32.270
While the official law
strictly prohibited these venues

00:31:32.270 --> 00:31:36.310
from facilitating or
providing any means for immoral

00:31:36.310 --> 00:31:41.610
or unchaste sexual activities
and from hiring or giving wages

00:31:41.610 --> 00:31:44.130
to people for this purpose,

00:31:44.130 --> 00:31:47.160
the government enforced
atraksiun performers

00:31:47.160 --> 00:31:51.730
to take compulsory medical exams
every six months to make sure

00:31:51.730 --> 00:31:55.340
that the performers, they're not
transmitters of sexual diseases

00:31:55.340 --> 00:31:59.080
in case they engaged in sexual
acts with the audiences.

00:31:59.080 --> 00:32:04.290
Such [inaudible] government's
dual attitude is clarified

00:32:04.290 --> 00:32:09.240
in the city police or [inaudible]
classification of prostitution

00:32:09.240 --> 00:32:13.070
that recognized all female
servants of Tehran's nightlife

00:32:13.070 --> 00:32:16.970
as prostitutes, thus placing
the cafes and cabarets

00:32:16.970 --> 00:32:22.620
in a [inaudible] position between
performance sphere and covert,

00:32:22.620 --> 00:32:27.770
and covert prostitution sites.

00:32:27.770 --> 00:32:29.290
This all-encompassing

00:32:29.290 --> 00:32:33.260
and deterministic attitude is also
observable in the press discourse

00:32:33.260 --> 00:32:37.680
of the [inaudible] that a
cabaret dancer's past, present

00:32:37.680 --> 00:32:43.340

associated with prostitution.

Appearing in various forms
of writing including reports

00:32:46.700 --> 00:32:49.560
and fictions, male journalists,

00:32:49.560 --> 00:32:55.760
journalists sold their papers
featuring the desired image

00:32:55.760 --> 00:32:58.560
of the prostitute raqqas.

00:32:58.560 --> 00:33:03.210
While simultaneously
condemning or ridiculing her.

00:33:03.210 --> 00:33:06.560
Tehran's nightlife was
also publicized as a space

00:33:06.560 --> 00:33:12.990
for forgetting the day-to-day,
day-to-day mechanicalistic,

00:33:12.990 --> 00:33:17.590
modern life where audience
members supposedly delved

00:33:17.590 --> 00:33:22.330
into their own fantasies
by watching performances.

00:33:22.330 --> 00:33:27.580
But if the nightlife was a space
for forgetting and fantasizing,

00:33:27.580 --> 00:33:33.120
the pre-revolutionary Iranian
cinema definitely was a space

00:33:33.120 --> 00:33:36.010
to watch the fantasy unfold.

00:33:36.010 --> 00:33:42.260
As I explain in chapter five of
my book, Iranian cinema made use

00:33:42.260 --> 00:33:47.360
of dancing bodies from its
early days, even from 1930s,

00:33:47.360 --> 00:33:52.690
but it was the cabaret raqqas
who dominated the screen.

00:33:52.690 --> 00:33:57.470
And who supposedly seductive
dancing body also made,

00:33:57.470 --> 00:34:00.620
made up for the lack of sex scenes.

00:34:00.620 --> 00:34:05.560
And teased the sexual
imagination of the audiences.

00:34:05.560 --> 00:34:09.090
Beginning with the production of
the 1949 film, [foreign language],

00:34:09.090 --> 00:34:15.600 position:56%
kafahs and cabarets became the space
which came to represent the audible,

00:34:15.600 --> 00:34:21.930 position:56%
ultimate urban vice onscreen as
Iranian cinema deployed the pleasure

00:34:21.930 --> 00:34:27.320
of watching the dissolute
while condemning it as immoral.

00:34:27.320 --> 00:34:30.580
The performers and the audience
of cabarets were all part

00:34:30.580 --> 00:34:33.960
of this attractive
spectacle of vice.

00:34:33.960 --> 00:34:38.710
By 1954, the [inaudible] was
already exhausted so much

00:34:38.710 --> 00:34:42.960 position:56%
that film critics started
complaining that most films produced

00:34:42.960 --> 00:34:46.790
to that date featured
cabaret scenes.

00:34:46.790 --> 00:34:51.480
The improper insertions of song
and dance segments, they claim,

00:34:51.480 --> 00:34:54.820
damage the storyline
that had to be paused

00:34:54.820 --> 00:34:57.110
when the on-screen café spectators

00:34:57.110 --> 00:35:01.730
and the cinema audiences
all gazes at dancing bodies.

00:35:01.730 --> 00:35:07.810
In the cinema discourse, the
dancing body was largely associated

00:35:07.810 --> 00:35:11.950
with eroticism or shahvat,
a nakedness, [inaudible],

00:35:11.950 --> 00:35:17.610
which were perceived as
selling factors in films.

00:35:17.610 --> 00:35:22.510
Yet as dance segments
guaranteed the box office sale,

00:35:22.510 --> 00:35:26.610
they were not only inserted
into Iranian productions,

00:35:26.610 --> 00:35:31.970
but also into cowboy films
when they were shown in Iran.

00:35:36.210 --> 00:35:40.540
Even though dancings were regularly
features in films in the 1950s

00:35:40.540 --> 00:35:45.200
and '60s, there are [inaudible]
appeared as a character.

00:35:45.200 --> 00:35:48.540
It's only in the late
1960s, and especially

00:35:48.540 --> 00:35:54.620
after the aforementioned 1970
film which we watched a trailer,

00:35:54.620 --> 00:36:00.510
its trailer, Raqqasah'i Shahr, that
the dancer became a lead character.

00:36:00.510 --> 00:36:05.360
After the success of this tactic,
several films with the term

00:36:05.360 --> 00:36:09.650
"Raqqasah" in the title or Raqqasah

00:36:09.650 --> 00:36:12.510
as a leading character,
were produced.

00:36:12.510 --> 00:36:18.330
[ Inaudible ]

00:36:18.330 --> 00:36:24.090
The myths surrounding her cotillion
life was persistently present.

00:36:24.090 --> 00:36:27.920
Some films depicted her
as a part-time prostitute.

00:36:27.920 --> 00:36:32.160
Others portrayed her as a
self-sacrificing single mother,

00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:36.770
but most more often in the
films she was in love with a man

00:36:36.770 --> 00:36:39.550
for whom she is ready to change.

00:36:39.550 --> 00:36:44.160
The resolution of her journey most
often involves leaving the public

00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:51.060
stage of the cabaret by agreeing to
marry a male hero, and retreating

00:36:51.060 --> 00:36:55.390
to the private, moral
realm of the home.

When she swears to forget her dark
past and become his ideal housewife.

But no matter what, her
past always haunts her.

00:37:06.810 --> 00:37:11.930
In the Iranian movies, the dancer's
life story may have unfolded

00:37:11.930 --> 00:37:16.200
in different ways, but it
always reproduced the myths

00:37:16.200 --> 00:37:24.030
of her off-stage life, something
that was locally produced in Iran.

00:37:24.030 --> 00:37:27.930

and framed by his lens,

raqqas' supposedly out of control
body, attire, movements, and mimicry

00:37:34.200 --> 00:37:40.300
and comedy were striking,
elating, and recognizable.

00:37:40.300 --> 00:37:43.870
Her audience not only
enjoyed her attractiveness,

00:37:43.870 --> 00:37:47.380
but also took pleasure in
understanding and recognizing her

00:37:47.380 --> 00:37:50.420
and blaming her at the same time.

00:37:50.420 --> 00:37:56.370
In the fantasy of films, her
male audiences could identify,

00:37:56.370 --> 00:38:00.810 position:56%
could identify with the onscreen
cabaret audience and the movie hero,

00:38:00.810 --> 00:38:05.490
the one who rescued this femme
fatale by possessing her.

00:38:05.490 --> 00:38:08.100
If she didn't obey,
she would be slapped

00:38:08.100 --> 00:38:11.090
and called a prostitute
in a harsh way.

00:38:11.090 --> 00:38:16.140
In the final years of the
[inaudible] there was a backlash

00:38:16.140 --> 00:38:17.590
from the cinema community

00:38:17.590 --> 00:38:22.300
and the more powerful female casts
including [inaudible] who appeared

00:38:22.300 --> 00:38:24.640
in the film that you watched.

00:38:28.150 --> 00:38:33.530
Who resented the way in which their
bodies had been treated onscreen.

00:38:33.530 --> 00:38:36.190
Some actresses left
their job forever,

00:38:36.190 --> 00:38:38.870
as they couldn't tolerate
the pressures imposed

00:38:38.870 --> 00:38:41.880
on their bodies in performance.

00:38:41.880 --> 00:38:44.960
Nevertheless, new faces
are replacing them

00:38:44.960 --> 00:38:48.120
to keep the private sector
entertainment industry

00:38:48.120 --> 00:38:51.850
of the [inaudible] running, an
industry which in the absence

00:38:51.850 --> 00:38:56.680 position:56%
of government support, was highly
dependent on the [inaudible] economy

00:38:56.680 --> 00:39:00.130
of its dancers and actresses.

00:39:00.130 --> 00:39:04.950
The revolutionary discourse
which I extensively explore

00:39:04.950 --> 00:39:08.700
in my book also responded to
the abuse of the men's sexuality

00:39:08.700 --> 00:39:11.490
and their [inaudible]
representation.

00:39:11.490 --> 00:39:16.960 position:56%
And blamed the [inaudible] state
for disseminating social corruption.

00:39:16.960 --> 00:39:20.250
An example of this attitude
is evident in an article

00:39:20.250 --> 00:39:24.780
that recognized sex, dance,
alcohol, and drugs as weapons

00:39:24.780 --> 00:39:30.720
of U.S. imperialism to which the
disinherited [inaudible] countries

00:39:30.720 --> 00:39:33.830
were held back and weakened.

00:39:33.830 --> 00:39:38.900
It was in this context that
with the Revolution of 1979,

00:39:38.900 --> 00:39:44.580
the public spaces of leisure
associated with prostitution

00:39:44.580 --> 00:39:47.730
and eroticism, such
as cinemas, cabarets,

00:39:47.730 --> 00:39:52.500
as well as the prostitution
district were banned altogether.

00:39:52.500 --> 00:39:55.380
And this is one of
the famous cabarets,

00:39:55.380 --> 00:39:59.440
[inaudible] which was
located on Lalehzar Street.

00:39:59.440 --> 00:40:06.050
While some of the performing
arts were disrupted for a while,

00:40:06.050 --> 00:40:08.760
they gradually found
their way back to stage.

00:40:08.760 --> 00:40:14.610 position:56%
Even national dance, as I mentioned
earlier, was originally [inaudible].

00:40:14.610 --> 00:40:19.270
Nevertheless, in government's
discourse and most importantly

00:40:19.270 --> 00:40:23.630
in the social imagination of
Iranians all around the world,

00:40:23.630 --> 00:40:28.580 position:56%
cabaret dance and its interconnected
realms including Lalehzar Street,

00:40:28.580 --> 00:40:32.630
Lalehzar scene, continued
to constitute a negative

00:40:32.630 --> 00:40:36.740
and suspicious space,
a contributing factor

00:40:36.740 --> 00:40:40.970
to the challenges I faced
while writing about them.

00:40:46.060 --> 00:40:48.890
After the submission of
my book for publication,

00:40:48.890 --> 00:40:52.420
I initiated a new digital project

00:40:52.420 --> 00:40:56.910
on Lalehzar Street
between 1900 and 1979.

00:41:00.040 --> 00:41:04.520
Which I believe will shed light on
many aspects of urban, diplomatic,

00:41:04.520 --> 00:41:07.180
and social history of modern Iran.

00:41:07.180 --> 00:41:13.670
This, this project is part of the
Roshan Institute, Roshan Initiative

least a decade to come,

I will be receiving more
smiles and surprises

00:41:23.900 --> 00:41:26.530
than I introduced its
title, Lalehzar.

00:41:26.530 --> 00:41:34.590
But ladies, ladies and gentlemen,
I'm up for the challenge again.

is audiences all the way back there,

00:41:55.990 --> 00:41:58.400
when they ask something,
could you also repeat it

00:41:58.400 --> 00:41:59.700
so that we have that [inaudible]?

00:41:59.700 --> 00:42:01.000
&gt;&gt; Ida Meftahi: Sure.

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:02.300
&gt;&gt; Hirad Dinavari:
Thank you very much.

00:42:02.300 --> 00:42:03.600
Go ahead, [inaudible].

00:42:03.600 --> 00:42:04.900
&gt;&gt; Questions?

00:42:04.900 --> 00:42:08.060
&gt;&gt; Fatemeh Keshavarz: Actually,
this is not a question.

00:42:08.060 --> 00:42:11.470
I just want to say
that Dr. Meftahi is --

00:42:11.470 --> 00:42:14.690
has a team of people
that we have [inaudible]

00:42:14.690 --> 00:42:20.200
at Roshan Institute collecting
materials and rare documents

00:42:20.200 --> 00:42:25.530
from photographs to interviews to,
you know, all kinds of documents

00:42:25.530 --> 00:42:30.210 position:56%
that were contributed as [inaudible]
project which really shed light

00:42:30.210 --> 00:42:34.590
on a very important aspect of
the development of the culture.

00:42:34.590 --> 00:42:39.510
So she kind of -- just [inaudible]
talk, she was modest about it.

00:42:39.510 --> 00:42:43.020
[ Inaudible ]

00:42:43.020 --> 00:42:49.140
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I had a question
about you mentioned earlier

00:42:49.140 --> 00:42:56.370
that there were foreign
dancers and Iranian dancers.

00:42:56.370 --> 00:43:01.850
I was wondering if the
foreign dancers tended to be

00:43:01.850 --> 00:43:09.290 position:56%
from certain places or was like a
certain group of people who occupied

00:43:09.290 --> 00:43:10.780 position:56%
that role, Western style of dancing?

00:43:10.780 --> 00:43:12.080
&gt;&gt; Ida Meftahi: Yes,
well there, okay,

00:43:12.080 --> 00:43:13.380
so [inaudible] question here is
about basically the background

00:43:13.380 --> 00:43:15.300
of the foreign dancers,
where they came from,

00:43:15.300 --> 00:43:17.920
and what type of dances
they performed.

00:43:17.920 --> 00:43:25.010
And I think from 1940s on, we see,
we hear about foreign dancers.

00:43:25.010 --> 00:43:26.310
I know that, for instance,

00:43:26.310 --> 00:43:31.860
Polish refugees performed
when they were in Iran.

00:43:31.860 --> 00:43:36.800
They basically took refuge in Iran

00:43:36.800 --> 00:43:40.070
in the Polish cafe
on Lalehzar Street.

00:43:40.070 --> 00:43:44.500
Other than that, we've heard
about -- I mean there are many,

00:43:44.500 --> 00:43:50.370
various versions of this:
German dancers, French dancers,

00:43:50.370 --> 00:43:56.240
Arabic dancers, belly dancers.

00:43:56.240 --> 00:44:02.810
And sometimes even people claim to
be foreign but they were Iranian

00:44:02.810 --> 00:44:06.080
because it was more
attractive to people, so.

00:44:06.080 --> 00:44:12.600
But later on when this whole
scene of cabaret dance grew,

00:44:12.600 --> 00:44:16.070
they were commissioning
performers to come and perform.

00:44:16.070 --> 00:44:19.630
For instance, Jerry Lewis was
one of the people who came and,

00:44:19.630 --> 00:44:22.510
you know, performed in a cabaret.

00:44:22.510 --> 00:44:28.510 position:56%
So cabaret became an institution for
entertainment, basically by itself.

00:44:28.510 --> 00:44:35.310
[ Inaudible ]

00:44:35.310 --> 00:44:37.110
Yes.

00:44:37.110 --> 00:44:40.040
[ Inaudible ]

00:44:40.040 --> 00:44:44.100
Yes. And well, I would say
for sure some of them were,

00:44:44.100 --> 00:44:46.880
some of the Iranian, some

00:44:46.880 --> 00:44:53.440 position:56%
of the Armenian performers were also
performing in the cabaret setting.

00:44:53.440 --> 00:44:58.230
But most of the time you hear their
names associated with the more,

00:44:58.230 --> 00:45:05.360
sort of the higher arts, national
art, national dance setting.

00:45:05.360 --> 00:45:11.730
They were the, basically they
were the first women to perform

00:45:11.730 --> 00:45:16.230
on this kind of high art setting.

00:45:16.230 --> 00:45:22.330 position:56%
And then gradually they trained more
and more Iranian women in ballet,

00:45:22.330 --> 00:45:27.550
for instance, and open,
opened up for others.

00:45:27.550 --> 00:45:29.350
Yes?

00:45:29.350 --> 00:45:53.460
[ Inaudible ]

00:45:53.460 --> 00:45:57.430
Yes. So my, my dance
teacher, first dance teacher,

00:45:57.430 --> 00:46:00.830
of the Armenian couple
that I mentioned,

00:46:00.830 --> 00:46:04.240
they were in fact,
ballet instructors.

00:46:04.240 --> 00:46:12.530
It was Madame [inaudible], but
my serous dance training was

00:46:12.530 --> 00:46:16.860
with [inaudible] who, as I
mentioned, was the soloist

00:46:16.860 --> 00:46:22.490
of the National Dance Company
prior to the revolution,

00:46:22.490 --> 00:46:27.680
who had also as a national dancer
received ballet training before.

00:46:27.680 --> 00:46:34.680 position:56%
Ballet training, basically ballet
kind of started with the immigrants,

00:46:34.680 --> 00:46:37.130
Armenian immigrants
who came to Iran.

00:46:37.130 --> 00:46:44.780
And yes, I mention it in my second
chapter, and their contributions

00:46:44.780 --> 00:46:47.650
to this whole idea
of national dance,

00:46:47.650 --> 00:46:49.830
and the National Ballet
Company of Iran.

00:46:49.830 --> 00:46:51.630
Yes, they're very present there.

00:46:51.630 --> 00:47:20.300
[ Inaudible ]

00:47:20.300 --> 00:47:24.750
Even in earlier time, you see
a lot of Russian folk dances,

00:47:24.750 --> 00:47:30.850
for instance, being
performed in 1920s and '30s.

00:47:30.850 --> 00:47:41.170
Since [inaudible] time, we've
seen performance of folk groups

00:47:41.170 --> 00:47:48.150
from different regions in let's say
[inaudible] and places like that.

00:47:48.150 --> 00:47:53.420
But since 1940s, there were
attempts of staging folk dances,

00:47:53.420 --> 00:47:57.070
but most of the time they
were stylized versions.

00:47:57.070 --> 00:48:01.200
Of course I'm particularly
talking about,

00:48:01.200 --> 00:48:04.530
you know, official stage in Iran.

00:48:04.530 --> 00:48:15.020 position:56%
But here and there you see them
becoming more involved and by 1960s,

00:48:15.020 --> 00:48:25.250
there's this official group
folk dance company that was,

00:48:25.250 --> 00:48:28.410
there's basically, their
whole occupation was

00:48:28.410 --> 00:48:31.240
to present folk dances.

00:48:31.240 --> 00:48:34.650
And sometimes they were
groups that were brought from,

00:48:34.650 --> 00:48:36.870
you know, different regions.

00:48:36.870 --> 00:48:38.670
Yes?

00:48:38.670 --> 00:48:51.310
[ Inaudible ]

00:48:51.310 --> 00:48:52.610
Yes.

00:48:52.610 --> 00:48:54.040
[ Inaudible ]

00:48:54.040 --> 00:48:58.840
Uh, no. So the question
was about [inaudible]

00:48:58.840 --> 00:49:03.800
or theater or was it dance?

00:49:03.800 --> 00:49:06.270
Yes, [inaudible] theater and dance,

00:49:06.270 --> 00:49:09.890
they are very much
associated with [inaudible].

00:49:09.890 --> 00:49:12.480
So, I -- yes.

00:49:12.480 --> 00:49:18.470
So I didn't show them, but
they're part of that realm.

00:49:18.470 --> 00:49:20.270
Yes?

00:49:20.270 --> 00:49:29.040
[ Inaudible ]

00:49:29.040 --> 00:49:36.090
Yes. I mean, from what I gathered
from this, from the interviews,

00:49:36.090 --> 00:49:41.150
with my interviewees who were also
involved with the mutribi setting,

00:49:41.150 --> 00:49:43.650
yes, to a degree they were Jewish.

00:49:43.650 --> 00:49:45.020
Or non-Muslim.

00:49:45.020 --> 00:49:48.720
But at some point in
Iran, whoever wanted

00:49:48.720 --> 00:49:53.400
to join the artistic scene
had to join the mutribs.

00:49:53.400 --> 00:49:59.850
If they could afford, they could go
to, you know, better place maybe,

00:49:59.850 --> 00:50:03.990
more official institution
which was being developed

00:50:03.990 --> 00:50:05.640
from [inaudible] era.

00:50:05.640 --> 00:50:10.560
But before that, really
if you loved to do music

00:50:10.560 --> 00:50:15.260
and you couldn't afford a better
way, your local musician was there.

00:50:15.260 --> 00:50:20.640
I would say they were the
preservers of Iranian culture.

00:50:20.640 --> 00:50:21.980
Before, you know.

00:50:21.980 --> 00:50:23.280
&gt;&gt; I just have one question.

00:50:23.280 --> 00:50:24.580
&gt;&gt; Ida Meftahi: Yes?

00:50:24.580 --> 00:50:26.670
&gt;&gt; Growing up and not an expert
on dance, I kind of saw dance

00:50:26.670 --> 00:50:29.720
in Iran divide into
three subcategories.

00:50:29.720 --> 00:50:32.270
One was the [inaudible],
that official stuff.

00:50:32.270 --> 00:50:34.680
And dances like [inaudible]
which was staged

00:50:34.680 --> 00:50:36.170
and very professionally --

00:50:36.170 --> 00:50:37.470
&gt;&gt; Ida Meftahi: Yes.

00:50:37.470 --> 00:50:38.770
&gt;&gt; Then there was the folk troupes,

00:50:38.770 --> 00:50:42.460
and then there was the whole thing
[inaudible] cabaret, and sort of.

00:50:42.460 --> 00:50:46.040 position:56%
Is that a correct way to
categorize, or are there more genres

00:50:46.040 --> 00:50:49.040
or subcategories that
I'm overlooking?

00:50:49.040 --> 00:50:50.340
&gt;&gt; Ida Meftahi: Well, no.

00:50:50.340 --> 00:50:53.100
Actually, I think, and these
are basically the three dances

00:50:53.100 --> 00:50:54.990
characters that I've
been discussing,

00:50:54.990 --> 00:50:58.360
except for the folk dance
that I don't get into.

00:50:58.360 --> 00:51:00.950
It's in the context
of the, you know,

00:51:00.950 --> 00:51:03.590
preservation the national
culture of Iran.

00:51:03.590 --> 00:51:08.770
So in a way that folk dance, the
way they present it became part

00:51:08.770 --> 00:51:16.960
of that national culture more than,
you know, presenting folklore life.

00:51:16.960 --> 00:51:20.350
So yes, that, the way
they categorize dance was

00:51:20.350 --> 00:51:21.650
[foreign language].

00:51:21.650 --> 00:51:26.650
So national dancers
and folk dancers,

00:51:26.650 --> 00:51:30.200
and my teacher was a
soloist of [inaudible],

00:51:30.200 --> 00:51:36.290
and [inaudible] was presented
by the National Ballet of Iran

00:51:36.290 --> 00:51:38.610
which was again, housed
in [inaudible].

00:51:38.610 --> 00:51:42.190
So they were kind of
very close together.

00:51:42.190 --> 00:51:44.050
And the third category
was [foreign language].

00:51:44.050 --> 00:51:45.530
Cabaret dancer.

00:51:45.530 --> 00:51:46.830
&gt;&gt; Hirad Dinavari:
One more question,

00:51:46.830 --> 00:51:52.510
and then we have a book
signing, [inaudible].

00:51:52.510 --> 00:52:10.130
[ Inaudible ]

00:52:10.130 --> 00:52:14.880
&gt;&gt; Ida Meftahi: I intentionally
decided to, I mean,

00:52:14.880 --> 00:52:19.100
in my book explore just, you
know, the official stage.

00:52:19.100 --> 00:52:26.100
But I've, I mean, even, even some
of the mutribs or [inaudible] were

00:52:26.100 --> 00:52:31.010
by themselves kind of gypsy types
that they, you know, traveled

00:52:31.010 --> 00:52:34.950
and then in the 20th
century, they settled.

00:52:34.950 --> 00:52:40.890
But I've heard of gypsy
dancers in [inaudible] as well,

00:52:40.890 --> 00:52:44.750
and I know that they have, I mean
and I've heard that they have,

00:52:44.750 --> 00:52:49.200
you know, some kind of similarities
to gypsy dances in Iraq.

00:52:49.200 --> 00:52:52.420
So they're probably, you know,
there are some connections.

00:52:52.420 --> 00:52:57.510
But as I say, said, I don't
address it in my book.

00:52:57.510 --> 00:53:04.090
[ Inaudible ]

00:53:04.090 --> 00:53:09.060

dancers of Iran which, as I,

00:53:09.060 --> 00:53:14.890
as I mentioned, my advisor
was, my teacher was a soloist,

00:53:14.890 --> 00:53:18.010
they did stage [inaudible]
gypsy dance.

00:53:18.010 --> 00:53:20.510
But I would say it
was very stylized.

[ Inaudible ]

00:53:53.060 --> 00:53:56.410
Actually, in the pre-revolutionary
Iranian cinema, when they wanted

00:53:56.410 --> 00:54:02.860
to show, you know, dancers this
style of dance of but not getting

00:54:02.860 --> 00:54:09.080
to the whole, you know, problems,
complications of cabaret dance.

00:54:09.080 --> 00:54:15.900
They were like using gypsy
dancers, gypsy dance characters

00:54:15.900 --> 00:54:20.630
who exactly reflected
the same people.
