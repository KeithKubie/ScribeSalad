that unless it would connect to the
 

00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:26.650
that unless it would connect to the

story and again what I like is that with
 

00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:28.120

Adventure Time because you can sort of

00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:28.130
Adventure Time because you can sort of
 

00:08:28.130 --> 00:08:30.160

like these characters are real and I

00:08:37.719 --> 00:08:37.729
like these characters are real and I
 

00:08:37.729 --> 00:08:38.920
like these characters are real and I
think when you do that when you have

00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:38.930
think when you do that when you have
 

00:08:38.930 --> 00:08:40.659
think when you do that when you have
just little drops of that that don't

00:08:40.659 --> 00:08:40.669
just little drops of that that don't
 

00:08:40.669 --> 00:08:43.300
just little drops of that that don't
necessarily connect to a story but it's

00:08:43.300 --> 00:08:43.310
necessarily connect to a story but it's
 

00:08:43.310 --> 00:08:45.570
necessarily connect to a story but it's
in an episode where it doesn't have to

00:08:45.570 --> 00:08:45.580
