00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.120
So a few weeks ago I was looking through my Snaps

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:14.920
Cat.  Cat.  Cat.  Dick!

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:16.200
It was horrifying.

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:19.980
But I figured "Oh!  Maybe this is just like one weirdo

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.060
an isolated incident.  Maybe it will never happen again."

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:25.160
Because I like looking at everyone's Snaps, you know?

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:26.980
Like, I get to meet so many new cats!

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:29.900
So I went back to looking at Snapchat, and of course

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:31.740
Dick!

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.560
I immediately changed my privacy settings.

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:37.780
I'm sorry all the cats I never got to meet.

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:41.940
And I tried to process this weird feeling of having seen

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.620
Stranger Danger dick pics.

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.360
Because first and foremost there are only 2 kinds of dick pics, right?

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:50.600
The ones that are unwanted, which are super gross.

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.260
And the ones that are wanted which are still kinda gross.

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:57.660
And it made me think:  what are guys hoping

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.660
that our response is to this?

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:03.100
Oh, a penis!  Let me screenshot that.

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:04.400
Print that.

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:05.720
Let me frame that.

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:09.300
Also, a straight man sending an unsolicited dick pic

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.640
is basically him telling the world that he doesn't

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.320
understand the psychology behind how women are sexually aroused.

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:17.380
Because men are stimulated visually, right?

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:20.380
So just a picture of a boob or a butt is enough to excite them.

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.000
But women?  We need some imagination stimulation.

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.380
Wait!  Before we do this, I want you to tell me every

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:30.020
thought you've had in your head from the moment that we've met.

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:31.780
As if we were vampires.

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:34.900
I have very few friends who actually enjoy dick pics

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:38.260
and even they agree:  dicks are weird looking.

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.460
They're not that great to look at on their own.

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:42.780
They're just not.  They kind of look like the

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.500
Graboid Monsters from Tremors (a movie).

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:45.100
*gasps*

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:48.700
Don't move.  It's coming!

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:51.620
It's coming!

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:54.520
It also, unfortunately, made me feel kind of violated.

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:57.760
Like, how could I sit here, alone, in my room

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:00.500
trying to meet new cats, and get a face full of

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:01.300
Dick!

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:04.580
Like if a dude burst into my room and shoved his penis in my face,

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.300
I could get that fool arrested.

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:08.500
But because someone far away did it

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.340
via the most efficient mode of communication possible

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.040
the only choice I have is to block everyone.

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:17.800
Cat Snaps included.

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:19.460
But what do you think?  Do you like dick pics?

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:21.740
Have you ever sent or received one?

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:24.880
Do you agree that they look like Graboids?

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.560
Hi my name is Annemarie and I'm going to be making

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.040
our Monsters for the film Tremors.

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.280
I just would like to know how do you envision them looking?

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:33.180
Dick!

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.420
I'm Anna Akana.  Stay awesome Gotham.
