00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:11.070
 
I've always been somebody that likes to

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:11.080
I've always been somebody that likes to
 

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:12.990
I've always been somebody that likes to
follow interesting questions and that

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:13.000
follow interesting questions and that
 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.780
follow interesting questions and that
initial work in Liz's lab was really a

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:15.790
initial work in Liz's lab was really a
 

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:18.900
initial work in Liz's lab was really a
curiosity driven question how can the

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:18.910
curiosity driven question how can the
 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:20.490
curiosity driven question how can the
cell maintained his chromosome ends when

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:20.500
cell maintained his chromosome ends when
 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:21.510
cell maintained his chromosome ends when
we know that they should be getting

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:21.520
we know that they should be getting
 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:23.310
we know that they should be getting
shorter so it was a puzzle that we

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:23.320
shorter so it was a puzzle that we
 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:25.109
shorter so it was a puzzle that we
needed to solve but it was an important

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:25.119
needed to solve but it was an important
 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:28.679
needed to solve but it was an important
puzzle because all cells need to solve

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:28.689
puzzle because all cells need to solve
 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:30.389
puzzle because all cells need to solve
this problem of replicating the

00:00:30.389 --> 00:00:30.399
this problem of replicating the
 

00:00:30.399 --> 00:00:32.249
this problem of replicating the
chromosome ends but I feel like I've

00:00:32.249 --> 00:00:32.259
chromosome ends but I feel like I've
 

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:34.860
chromosome ends but I feel like I've
been really fortunate because at every

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:34.870
been really fortunate because at every
 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:37.200
been really fortunate because at every
step then along the way I've been able

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.210
step then along the way I've been able
 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:40.530
step then along the way I've been able
to follow my curiosity and see where the

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:40.540
to follow my curiosity and see where the
 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:43.890
to follow my curiosity and see where the
next step left the next step led so for

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:43.900
next step left the next step led so for
 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:46.080
next step left the next step led so for
instance I started off working on this

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:46.090
instance I started off working on this
 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:47.760
instance I started off working on this
enzyme telomerase and trying to

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:47.770
enzyme telomerase and trying to
 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:49.800
enzyme telomerase and trying to
understand how the enzyme actually

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:49.810
understand how the enzyme actually
 

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:51.030
understand how the enzyme actually
functions what are the different

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:51.040
functions what are the different
 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:54.540
functions what are the different
components can we find out the mechanism

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:54.550
components can we find out the mechanism
 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:56.880
components can we find out the mechanism
by which this enzyme operates and then

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:56.890
by which this enzyme operates and then
 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:00.900
by which this enzyme operates and then
the question came up about cells and if

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:00.910
the question came up about cells and if
 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:02.700
the question came up about cells and if
the telomeres are shortening every time

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:02.710
the telomeres are shortening every time
 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:05.100
the telomeres are shortening every time
what would happen to cells and I got

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:05.110
what would happen to cells and I got
 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:06.899
what would happen to cells and I got
then into this field of cellular

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:06.909
then into this field of cellular
 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:09.660
then into this field of cellular
senescence which is the cells can divide

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:09.670
senescence which is the cells can divide
 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:11.580
senescence which is the cells can divide
a certain number of times and then they

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:11.590
a certain number of times and then they
 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:13.560
a certain number of times and then they
stop dividing and it turns out that the

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:13.570
stop dividing and it turns out that the
 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:15.840
stop dividing and it turns out that the
short telomeres play a role in that so

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:15.850
short telomeres play a role in that so
 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:18.480
short telomeres play a role in that so
that was a very interesting discovery

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:18.490
that was a very interesting discovery
 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:20.340
that was a very interesting discovery
and that then led to the next question

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:20.350
and that then led to the next question
 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:22.800
and that then led to the next question
which is if the cells normally stop

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:22.810
which is if the cells normally stop
 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:24.840
which is if the cells normally stop
dividing why don't cancer cells stop

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:24.850
dividing why don't cancer cells stop
 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:26.370
dividing why don't cancer cells stop
dividing that's a cell type that has to

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:26.380
dividing that's a cell type that has to
 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:28.860
dividing that's a cell type that has to
divide many times so then our interest

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:28.870
divide many times so then our interest
 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:31.410
divide many times so then our interest
went into the area of cancer research

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:31.420
went into the area of cancer research
 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:33.840
went into the area of cancer research
and I was able to follow that because

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:33.850
and I was able to follow that because
 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:35.670
and I was able to follow that because
it's very nice to be able to be in this

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:35.680
it's very nice to be able to be in this
 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:36.930
it's very nice to be able to be in this
kind of environment where you can just

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:36.940
kind of environment where you can just
 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:38.190
kind of environment where you can just
do science and as long as you're

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:38.200
do science and as long as you're
 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:39.870
do science and as long as you're
learning something interesting and you

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:39.880
learning something interesting and you
 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:42.149
learning something interesting and you
can get funded and I've been funded

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:42.159
can get funded and I've been funded
 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:43.800
can get funded and I've been funded
continuously by the National Institutes

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:43.810
continuously by the National Institutes
 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:45.840
continuously by the National Institutes
of Health and so that's been very nice

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:45.850
of Health and so that's been very nice
 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:48.570
of Health and so that's been very nice
to then be able to follow the next steps

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:48.580
to then be able to follow the next steps
 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:51.120
to then be able to follow the next steps
along the way in terms of what the most

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:51.130
along the way in terms of what the most
 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:56.940
along the way in terms of what the most
interesting question was to me

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:56.950
 
 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:00.560
 
at the time there were really two main

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570
at the time there were really two main
 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.779
at the time there were really two main
hypotheses for how telomers maybe

00:02:02.779 --> 00:02:02.789
hypotheses for how telomers maybe
 

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:05.450
hypotheses for how telomers maybe
elongated that there could be a

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460
elongated that there could be a
 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.919
elongated that there could be a
recombination based model or this

00:02:07.919 --> 00:02:07.929
recombination based model or this
 

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:10.529
recombination based model or this
hypothetical ends on and I just thought

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:10.539
hypothetical ends on and I just thought
 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:13.500
hypothetical ends on and I just thought
it was like an exciting puzzle to to see

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510
it was like an exciting puzzle to to see
 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:15.930
it was like an exciting puzzle to to see
which might be true and so I chose one

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940
which might be true and so I chose one
 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:17.339
which might be true and so I chose one
because I was working with Liz which was

00:02:17.339 --> 00:02:17.349
because I was working with Liz which was
 

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:20.070
because I was working with Liz which was
to look for an enzyme which might

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080
to look for an enzyme which might
 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:23.309
to look for an enzyme which might
lengthen telomeres and it was really

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:23.319
lengthen telomeres and it was really
 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:25.979
lengthen telomeres and it was really
just fun to be part of solving that

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:25.989
just fun to be part of solving that
 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:30.360
just fun to be part of solving that
puzzle

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370
 
 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:31.619
 
of course it could have been possible

00:02:31.619 --> 00:02:31.629
of course it could have been possible
 

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:32.300
of course it could have been possible
that there

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310
that there
 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:33.949
that there
another mechanism that lengthen

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959
another mechanism that lengthen
 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:37.160
another mechanism that lengthen
telomeres and is not clear how long one

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170
telomeres and is not clear how long one
 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:38.960
telomeres and is not clear how long one
would then keep looking for something

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970
would then keep looking for something
 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.750
would then keep looking for something
without any success luckily in my case

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760
without any success luckily in my case
 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.339
without any success luckily in my case
it was about nine months of trying

00:02:43.339 --> 00:02:43.349
it was about nine months of trying
 

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:45.440
it was about nine months of trying
various things and then had some success

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450
various things and then had some success
 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.470
various things and then had some success
but yes there are a number of dead ends

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480
but yes there are a number of dead ends
 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.100
but yes there are a number of dead ends
in science and you may be doing

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110
in science and you may be doing
 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:53.210
in science and you may be doing
experiments along one track and either

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220
experiments along one track and either
 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:54.770
experiments along one track and either
technically the experiments don't work

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780
technically the experiments don't work
 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.890
technically the experiments don't work
or you get something some slightly wrong

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900
or you get something some slightly wrong
 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.960
or you get something some slightly wrong
and that's what's really important about

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970
and that's what's really important about
 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:02.330
and that's what's really important about
the whole scientific process is that

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340
the whole scientific process is that
 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.040
the whole scientific process is that
it's really about what the what the

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:04.050
it's really about what the what the
 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:06.559
it's really about what the what the
results are and either you or somebody

00:03:06.559 --> 00:03:06.569
results are and either you or somebody
 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:08.059
results are and either you or somebody
else will be able to determine whether

00:03:08.059 --> 00:03:08.069
else will be able to determine whether
 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:11.509
else will be able to determine whether
or not the results of your research are

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:11.519
or not the results of your research are
 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:14.300
or not the results of your research are
correct and so being able to let go of

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310
correct and so being able to let go of
 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:17.120
correct and so being able to let go of
ideas and move forward I think is just

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130
ideas and move forward I think is just
 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:22.430
ideas and move forward I think is just
as important as having good new ideas
