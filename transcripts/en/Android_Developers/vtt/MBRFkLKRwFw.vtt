00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:11.190
&gt;&gt; Android 1.6 enables applications to be
rendered properly on different display resolutions

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:18.410
and densities. Developers can also specify
the types of screens supported by the applications.

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:24.480
Android 1.6 includes support for CDMA in the
telephony stack. Support for new screen sizes

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:32.200
and CDMA means Android can run on even more
devices and networks. Quick Search Box allows

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:37.630
users to search the web and their phone directly
from the home screen. It provides suggested

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:46.300
results from the web even while the user is
still typing. Quick Search Box provides relevant

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:51.190
contextual information like local business
listings as suggestions without having even

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:57.870
to launch the browser. Users can also find
answers to common queries with Quick Search

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:04.989
Box, for example, local weather. Users can
search for information managed by applications

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:09.590
like contacts. But they can also take actions
such as...

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:16.750
&gt;&gt; Call Adam's mobile.
&gt;&gt; Users control how Quick Search Box works

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:21.240
on their phone. For example, they can select
what types of content is included in their

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:28.640
searches. The search framework provides developers
a way to easily expose relevant content from

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:34.810
their applications. Here's an app for letting
users track what books they have read. The

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:39.530
developer made the app searchable from the
Quick Search Box, by author name and provided

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:48.990
suggestions. Android 1.6 includes a Text-to-Speech
API. This API uses a multilingual speech synthesis

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:54.860
engine that allows applications to speak text
strings with the right accent. The initial

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:59.090
set of supported languages is available to
users from Android Market.

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:04.640
&gt;&gt; Wie geht es dir?
&gt;&gt; In Android market, we're making it even

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:10.849
easier for users to find great apps from developers.
The latest version of Market improves overall

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:17.670
discoverability. Users can quickly choose
among apps, games and downloads. In the category

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:24.439
view, they can explore the Top Paid, Top Free
and titles that just came in. And with each

00:02:24.439 --> 00:02:29.900
app or game, users can now see screenshots
submitted by developers as well as read the

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:36.489
reviews from other users. To learn more about
