00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:03.150
Let's think a little bit
about the different clues that

00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:07.880
have led us to conclude that we
have these lithospheric plates

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:10.240
moving relative to each other.

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:11.990
Now, the first clue,
and this is something

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:15.430
that I think many students
even in elementary school

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:18.310
first experience when they
first learn about geography,

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:21.790
is that it looks like the
continents could kind of fit

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:22.510
into each other.

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:24.440
And the most
obvious one of these

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:27.057
is when you look at this kind
of little pointy part of South

00:00:27.057 --> 00:00:28.890
America, and if you
have a more detailed map

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.500
it really is
amazing, how well it

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:35.430
seems to fit into the Nigerian
Basin right here in Africa.

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.310
It looks like at one time
this little pointy part

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:40.434
was nudged into
this part of Africa,

00:00:40.434 --> 00:00:41.850
that they were
actually connected.

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.290
And if you're a little
bit more creative,

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:44.706
there are other
parts of the world

00:00:44.706 --> 00:00:48.390
that you can kind of start to
see how they might have fit

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.720
in with each other in the past.

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:53.040
And that by itself, that's
just a very small clue,

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:57.290
but it kind of hints at well,
maybe if they at one time

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:00.550
were fitting next to each other,
if this was kind of connected,

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:02.757
then they've had to
moved apart at some time.

00:01:02.757 --> 00:01:04.840
Although it doesn't tell
us that it's still moving

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:06.687
or what might have
caused the movement.

00:01:06.687 --> 00:01:08.270
And it definitely
doesn't definitively

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:09.960
tell us that they even moved.

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.580
Maybe this is just a
coincidence that this coast

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:16.290
of South America looks
very similar to this coast

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.940
right here of Africa.

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:21.520
Now, the next clues
truly came over

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.330
I would say about the
last 60 or 70 years.

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:25.730
The first clue is
that OK, if you

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:27.449
go to the mid-Atlantic
ridge right here--

00:01:27.449 --> 00:01:28.990
So if you look at
the Atlantic Ocean.

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:33.320
Let me look at this
photograph right over here.

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:35.721
You don't normally see the
oceans highlighted like this.

00:01:35.721 --> 00:01:37.220
So let me make it
very clear to you.

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:41.030
This right here
is South America.

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:43.640
This right here is Africa.

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.920
This right here
is North America.

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.530
And so if you actually
look at the elevations

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:50.720
in the middle of the
ocean people noticed

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:52.910
in the middle of the
20th century that gee,

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:55.800
there's a ridge in the
middle of the Atlantic Ocean.

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:57.400
There's kind of a
mountain range that

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:00.930
goes straight up the middle
of the Atlantic Ocean.

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.660
So that by itself
doesn't tell you

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:06.030
that you have these plates
that are moving apart,

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.729
but it is kind of a
curious thing to look at.

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.199
And not only is
there this ridge.

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:12.810
There's lot of underwater
volcanic activity.

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.190
You have magma flowing
out and lava flowing out

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:18.550
into the water, and it's kind of
forming this ridge that really

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:20.472
goes across the
whole Atlantic Ocean.

00:02:20.472 --> 00:02:21.930
There are other
ridges in the world

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:23.910
like that, underwater ridges.

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.910
You have one over here
in the Pacific Ocean.

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:30.680
You have these here
in the Indian Ocean.

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.590
That's just a little
clue, but that by itself

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:38.600
doesn't tell you that
these plates are actually

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:40.820
moving apart at the ridge.

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:43.280
The more conclusive--
this is just

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:44.780
the beginning of
the clue-- but what

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:49.055
made this conclusive is
one, the separate discovery.

00:02:49.055 --> 00:02:50.430
And this is what's
interesting is

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:51.890
that you have these
separate discoveries

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:53.390
in different domains
that eventually

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:55.934
let you come to a
pretty neat conclusion.

00:02:55.934 --> 00:02:57.850
So you've had a separate
discovery that if you

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:00.500
look at different
eras of magnetic rock,

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:04.140
or maybe I should say magnetic
rock from different periods

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:05.441
in geologic time.

00:03:05.441 --> 00:03:07.440
And you can tell where
they are in geologic time

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:08.450
by how they're layered.

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:10.540
So this would be newer rock.

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:16.470
And then this would
be a little bit older.

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:21.630
And then this would
be even, even older.

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:23.670
Geologists noticed
something interesting.

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:28.762
If I were to take magnetic
rock, and if it was molten lava,

00:03:28.762 --> 00:03:30.970
and if it were to harden,
remember it's magnetic rock

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:33.250
so it would want to align
with the poles the same way

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:34.070
a compass would.

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:37.610
So if I had a bunch
of magnetic-- so

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:39.850
let's say this is
some lava right here.

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:45.270
And so the molecules
can align themselves.

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:47.770
Since it's a liquid and
they can align themselves,

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:50.750
they are going to naturally
want to align with the poles.

00:03:50.750 --> 00:04:00.990
So they'll naturally all want to
align in one direction because

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:02.910
of Earth's magnetic field.

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:06.180
And so when that lava
hardens into actual rock

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:10.180
that alignment will
kind of be frozen.

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:14.140
Now, if Earth's magnetic
field was constant over time,

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:16.690
then when you look at magnetic
rocks from any period,

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:22.077
you would expect them all to be
aligned in the same direction.

00:04:22.077 --> 00:04:24.410
So since we're taking a cross
section of rock here let's

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:28.841
say an alignment towards the
North pole looks like this.

00:04:28.841 --> 00:04:29.840
And I draw it like that.

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:32.242
That's kind of an arrow
pointing into our screen.

00:04:32.242 --> 00:04:34.450
And let's say an alignment
pointing to the South pole

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:35.430
would look like this.

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:38.179
This would be an arrow
pointing out of our screen.

00:04:38.179 --> 00:04:39.720
So what you would
expect is the newer

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:44.130
rock that kind of the alignment,
the field, the alignment

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:46.870
of the rock, would go into
the screen, and then the older

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:49.486
rock, it would still go
older into the screen.

00:04:49.486 --> 00:04:50.860
So if I were to
draw a top view--

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:51.930
Let me draw it
like this just so I

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:53.763
make sure that everyone
is on the same page.

00:04:53.763 --> 00:04:56.622
So let me just draw a
cross section like this

00:04:56.622 --> 00:04:58.330
so that we know what
we're talking about.

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:05.550
And so this is the
surface up here.

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:07.610
This up here is the surface.

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:11.160
When I talk about
going into the page

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:13.460
that means that
the magnetic rock

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:15.099
would be aligned
in that direction.

00:05:15.099 --> 00:05:16.890
And when I talk about
going out of the page

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:18.470
it means, so if
I were to draw it

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:21.810
like that, that means that
the magnetic rock would

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:23.030
be aligned in that direction.

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:26.430
Now, like I said, if the
magnetic field of Earth

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:31.270
never changed, then lava
that essentially cools down

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:34.850
into non-lava rock, or you
can say freezes into rock,

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:36.760
it would all point
into the same direction

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:41.730
regardless of when it hardened.

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:44.650
This would be the situation
in a constant magnetic field.

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:47.650
But what we've seen is
that that's not the case.

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:51.530
When you look at
older magnetic rock,

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:53.500
and depending on
how old you go, you

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:55.020
have the newer
rock that's aligned

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:56.530
with our current magnetic field.

00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:58.490
You go a little bit
older, and right now we

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:00.930
think it's about 780,000
years ago roughly.

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:03.420
You have to find rock of
that age, magnetic rock that

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:04.800
hardened at that time.

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:07.740
It's actually in the
opposite direction.

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:11.880
So actually, the magnetic
rock has hardened in a way

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:16.630
so it's as if the North Pole
was at the South Pole now,

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:18.550
the magnetic North pole.

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:20.970
So it's aligned in the
opposite direction.

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:23.530
So it's kind of pointing
out of the page here.

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:25.280
And then if you get
even older rock,

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:27.510
it's more aligned with
our traditional direction.

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:29.400
So it's more aligned than that.

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:33.100
And so the only
reasonable conclusion

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:36.000
that we can draw from this is
that Earth's magnetic field

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.140
has actually
fluctuated over time.

00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:52.330
Now, you're probably
thinking, Sal,

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:55.810
how is this relevant
to plate tectonics?

00:06:55.810 --> 00:06:58.837
Well, once you accept that
magnetic fields fluctuate

00:06:58.837 --> 00:07:00.420
over the history of
the Earth, there's

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:03.190
another interesting
observation you

00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:05.400
can make about the
rock that's kind

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:08.230
of at the basin of
the ocean floor.

00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:12.910
So not only do you have
this mid-Atlantic ridge,

00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:17.330
you have these volcanoes
spewing kind of new rock

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:20.120
into the ocean, creating this
kind of underwater mountain

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:23.160
ridge, but it also turns
out that the rock that

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:26.890
forms the sea
floor also contains

00:07:26.890 --> 00:07:29.680
a lot of magnetite,
which is magnetic.

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:33.975
And what's really interesting
about that-- so let me draw.

00:07:33.975 --> 00:07:35.350
So we're going to
have a top view

00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:36.516
just like we have over here.

00:07:36.516 --> 00:07:40.390
So let's say this is the
mid-Atlantic ridge right here.

00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:51.540
Now, this is really cool.

00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:53.030
So when they look
at rocks that are

00:07:53.030 --> 00:07:56.327
very close to the mid-Atlantic
ridge, they're aligned--

00:07:56.327 --> 00:07:57.910
and once again, we're
looking at rocks

00:07:57.910 --> 00:08:00.520
at the floor of the ocean--
they're aligned in a way

00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:03.930
that you would expect with
the current magnetic field.

00:08:03.930 --> 00:08:06.675
They are aligned just
like that, the way

00:08:06.675 --> 00:08:08.050
that you would
expect when you're

00:08:08.050 --> 00:08:10.410
looking at the magnetic rock
that's close to the ridge.

00:08:13.452 --> 00:08:14.910
But if you go a
little bit further,

00:08:14.910 --> 00:08:17.201
and when I say a little bit
I'm talking about thousands

00:08:17.201 --> 00:08:19.240
of miles, but when you
go further out from that

00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:22.989
you have stripes of
other magnetic rock

00:08:22.989 --> 00:08:24.655
that is going in the
opposite direction.

00:08:27.530 --> 00:08:28.565
It's going like this.

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:35.090
And what's even
cooler than the idea

00:08:35.090 --> 00:08:37.760
that it's switched directions
depending on how far you've

00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:39.360
gone from the rift
is that there's

00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:44.100
a symmetric stripe of
magnetic rock on exactly

00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:46.780
the same distance, or roughly
the same distance away

00:08:46.780 --> 00:08:48.627
from the rift
that's also pointing

00:08:48.627 --> 00:08:49.585
in that same direction.

00:08:54.522 --> 00:08:55.980
And you go a little
bit further out

00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:57.688
and you'll find some
rock that's pointing

00:08:57.688 --> 00:08:58.860
in the original direction.

00:09:01.510 --> 00:09:04.270
And even better, you go on
the symmetric other side

00:09:04.270 --> 00:09:06.860
of the actual ridge and
you find another set

00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:12.220
of rocks that's doing
the exact same thing.

00:09:12.220 --> 00:09:16.170
So if you accept that Earth's
magnetic field has kind of been

00:09:16.170 --> 00:09:20.100
flip flopping over time, the
only reasonable conclusion,

00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:23.420
at least that I could think of,
or the geologists can think of,

00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:28.630
is that sure, all
of this was formed

00:09:28.630 --> 00:09:30.390
at a similar period in time.

00:09:30.390 --> 00:09:32.760
This came out as
lava, magnetic lava,

00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:35.570
and then it all aligned
with Earth's magnetic field.

00:09:35.570 --> 00:09:37.320
And that's why it looks similar.

00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:41.497
You fast forward in time
some and the only way--

00:09:41.497 --> 00:09:43.330
Or actually, let's not
fast forward in time.

00:09:43.330 --> 00:09:45.660
The only way that these
could have formed,

00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:47.210
and they could have
been so similar.

00:09:47.210 --> 00:09:49.310
So if we rewind in
time, the only way

00:09:49.310 --> 00:09:52.930
that these purple magnetic rocks
could have aligned this way

00:09:52.930 --> 00:09:55.430
in exactly the same way and
exactly the same distance

00:09:55.430 --> 00:09:58.000
is if at some point they were
much closer to each other,

00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:59.333
if they were actually connected.

00:09:59.333 --> 00:10:04.240
So if we rewind in time maybe
at the mid-Atlantic rift

00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:09.070
you had all of the
purple rock coming out

00:10:09.070 --> 00:10:14.750
from those underwater
volcanoes, and at that time,

00:10:14.750 --> 00:10:18.470
Earth's magnetic field was the
opposite as it is right now.

00:10:18.470 --> 00:10:22.420
And then of course,
you had this blue rock

00:10:22.420 --> 00:10:25.660
that is looking like that.

00:10:25.660 --> 00:10:27.680
And so this seems like a
reasonable explanation.

00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:30.260
This rock and this rock
were at some point touching.

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:32.670
They were actually
formed at the exact place

00:10:32.670 --> 00:10:35.350
and at the same time.

00:10:35.350 --> 00:10:38.080
And so if this is the
case, if at one point

00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:39.790
this purple rock
was all together,

00:10:39.790 --> 00:10:42.820
and they formed at the same
time at the mid-Atlantic rift,

00:10:42.820 --> 00:10:44.530
we're assuming all
the rock was-- well,

00:10:44.530 --> 00:10:45.550
we don't have to make
that assumption--

00:10:45.550 --> 00:10:48.110
but if you assume that they've
formed at the same time,

00:10:48.110 --> 00:10:50.920
and that based on the pattern it
really does look like they do,

00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:54.347
and it's a symmetric
distance away from that rift,

00:10:54.347 --> 00:10:56.430
then the only reasonable
conclusion I can think of

00:10:56.430 --> 00:10:58.910
is that the rift has
had to move apart.

00:10:58.910 --> 00:11:01.410
The rift has had to move
apart from this period

00:11:01.410 --> 00:11:02.610
to that period.

00:11:02.610 --> 00:11:05.540
And there was a time when all
this blue rock was together.

00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:08.940
So that by itself, that frankly
is the most definitive evidence

00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:11.730
in the 1960s where it kind of
became conclusive that you did

00:11:11.730 --> 00:11:15.440
have these plates that were
moving away from each other.

00:11:18.742 --> 00:11:21.200
And obviously if the plates
are moving away from each other

00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:24.482
at some point, and that means
that just based on the way

00:11:24.482 --> 00:11:26.190
the map looks, at some
point they're also

00:11:26.190 --> 00:11:27.700
going to be moving
into each other.

00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:30.020
We could talk more about
that in future videos.

00:11:30.020 --> 00:11:33.070
But, you know, at
certain points one plate

00:11:33.070 --> 00:11:34.590
is moving under another.

00:11:34.590 --> 00:11:37.007
And we'll talk about how
that might partially explain,

00:11:37.007 --> 00:11:38.840
and we'll talk about
all of the explanations

00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:41.422
for why we think the plates
might actually be moving.

00:11:41.422 --> 00:11:43.630
But now, if we fast forward
to more present times now

00:11:43.630 --> 00:11:46.140
that we have GPS satellites
and all the rest,

00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:49.060
we can actually measure
the movement of the plates.

00:11:49.060 --> 00:11:52.500
This is actually
an image from NASA

00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:54.620
showing the vector
of the movements

00:11:54.620 --> 00:11:57.500
at different points on
the surface of the planet.

00:11:57.500 --> 00:11:59.750
And you can see we've
gotten a lot of vectors

00:11:59.750 --> 00:12:02.230
from the United States, so
it's almost hard to read

00:12:02.230 --> 00:12:04.385
since it's so chalk
full of vectors.

00:12:04.385 --> 00:12:06.620
But you can see right
over here in Hawaii.

00:12:06.620 --> 00:12:09.830
The Pacific Plate at that point
is moving in this Northwest

00:12:09.830 --> 00:12:12.800
direction as measured
by GPS satellites.

00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:16.050
And I want to make clear, this
movement is relatively slow.

00:12:16.050 --> 00:12:18.624
It's roughly the speed at
which fingernails grow,

00:12:18.624 --> 00:12:20.290
but if you do it over
millions of years,

00:12:20.290 --> 00:12:23.470
that actually amounts
to thousands of miles.

00:12:23.470 --> 00:12:26.422
So we're talking on the order
of about a centimeter a year

00:12:26.422 --> 00:12:27.380
for most of the plates.

00:12:27.380 --> 00:12:29.671
Some of the plates might be
moving a little bit faster,

00:12:29.671 --> 00:12:31.552
maybe close to 10
or 15 centimeters,

00:12:31.552 --> 00:12:33.135
but most are moving
about a centimeter

00:12:33.135 --> 00:12:35.332
a year, at the same rate
your fingernails are going.

00:12:35.332 --> 00:12:37.790
But this is fascinating because
we can actually measure it,

00:12:37.790 --> 00:12:39.200
because GPS is so accurate.

00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:41.200
Over here it looks like
the North American plate

00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:45.580
is kind of rotating
generally in that direction.

00:12:45.580 --> 00:12:50.320
The Nazca Plate right
here is moving roughly

00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:54.129
in that direction, moving
into the South American Plate.

00:12:54.129 --> 00:12:55.420
I'll leave you there right now.

00:12:55.420 --> 00:12:57.931
And actually before
I leave you there,

00:12:57.931 --> 00:12:59.430
this is another
thing that I got off

00:12:59.430 --> 00:13:01.638
the Wikipedia that shows
that same magnetic striping.

00:13:01.638 --> 00:13:03.670
It's maybe a slightly
neater drawing.

00:13:03.670 --> 00:13:06.566
I don't know which one might
be more helpful for you.

00:13:06.566 --> 00:13:08.190
But I'll leave you
there in this video.

00:13:08.190 --> 00:13:10.606
In the next video, we'll think
about some of the theories.

00:13:10.606 --> 00:13:12.317
We know now that the
plates are moving.

00:13:12.317 --> 00:13:13.900
Let's think about
some of the theories

00:13:13.900 --> 00:13:17.480
as to why they might
actually be moving.
