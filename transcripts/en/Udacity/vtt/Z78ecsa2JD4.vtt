00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:01.960
So if you've seen any of the other
interviews that I've done

00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:04.830
here at Udacity, you'll notice
that I'm now in the other chair.

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:07.670
And the reason is that what we're
talking about today is a subject near

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:08.300
and dear to my heart.

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:11.410
It's my dissertation topic,
which is intelligent tutoring systems.

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:14.370
So, Jason has graciously offered
to interview me on this one.

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:15.030
So.

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:15.870
&gt;&gt; So, all right, David.

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.500
Let's get started.

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:20.660
So what got you interested in working
in intelligent tutoring systems?

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:24.520
&gt;&gt; So from the time I was
16 until throughout my PhD,

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:26.070
I actually worked as a private tutor.

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.990
So I tutored mostly
high school subjects.

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.430
Math, physics, things like that.

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:33.168
And it was late in my Master's degree
when I became acquainted with a field

00:00:33.168 --> 00:00:35.400
called intelligent tutoring systems.

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.075
And it was basically, let's build
AI agents that can do the tutoring.

00:00:38.075 --> 00:00:41.680
And the opportunities offered by
them were absolutely enormous for

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:44.180
accessibility, availability,
cutting costs and

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:47.332
being able to distribute these things
to a large number of students.

00:00:47.332 --> 00:00:49.910
And so I really wanted to jump on board,
plus I always joke that

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:53.315
if anyone was going to replace me with
an AI agent, it may as well be me.

00:00:53.315 --> 00:00:53.870
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; So

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:58.340
my initial interest was really wanting
to bring the benefits of tutoring,

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:00.960
one on one tutoring where you have
real individualized feedback and

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.830
individualized attention to a much
broader audience of students that

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:05.470
wouldn't be able to
access it other wise.

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:06.840
&gt;&gt; Okay.
All right.

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.080
What is the most exciting possibility
of intelligent tutoring systems?

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.690
&gt;&gt; So, we've already seen intelligent
tutoring systems do some really exciting

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:15.480
things, things like
Carnegie Learning's Cognitive Tutor for

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:17.680
algebra in high school and
things like that.

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:20.880
But what I think is the most
exciting opportunity is

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.630
what the Internet can do to
actually scale these things up.

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:25.910
So right now, we have students
using them in classrooms and

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:28.330
they use them as complements
to their lessons, but

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:30.865
some new initiatives are looking at
actually putting that online, which is

00:01:30.865 --> 00:01:34.030
really powerful because it takes that
and it makes it available to everyone.

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:37.510
So things like IXL that do some
rudimentary kind of intelligent tutoring

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:40.720
system principles for the masses.

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:43.870
But what's really, really exciting, and
this is a little bit further out though,

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:47.030
is the idea that, in the future, we
might not just have intelligent tutoring

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:49.040
systems that can kind of
monitor what you do, and

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.105
give you feedback that it
already kind of knows about.

00:01:51.105 --> 00:01:51.690
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:54.220
&gt;&gt; But intelligent tutoring systems
that, themselves, can learn.

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:56.980
So if I have a intelligent tutoring
system equipped with some machine

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:59.370
learning that can look
at 100,000 students, and

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:01.620
look at what feedback it
gave to what mistakes and

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:05.470
what actually led to future improvement,
it can actually then improve itself.

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:08.449
It can learn what teaching strategies,
or what feedback,

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:12.710
or what responses are most useful to
students for certain kinds of errors.

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:16.580
&gt;&gt; And then it might be able to start to
unlock some principles of feedback or

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:19.790
some principles of teaching that
we don't even know about yet.

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:22.790
When I was tutoring back
in my earlier life,

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:24.890
I worked with maybe ten
students at a time.

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:28.650
I've probably worked with 50 or 60
students over the course of my career.

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.420
And I drew from that a lot.

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.620
But 50 or 60 students,
it's a decent knowledge base.

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:36.770
But if we had an AI agent that could
do it based on a 100,000 students or

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:40.000
a million students,
and experiences across

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.170
the entire course of their curriculum,
that would be incredibly powerful.

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.710
&gt;&gt; Absolutely.
&gt;&gt; And

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:46.663
the other thing is that when I'm
working with students, usually I'd get

00:02:46.663 --> 00:02:51.350
them maybe in ninth or tenth grade, and
very often what I would find is that

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:54.850
the difficulties they were having with
a certain concept in math in tenth grade

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:57.800
really went back to difficulties they
had with fractions in fifth grade.

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:58.390
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; And

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:00.920
really, the ideal would be,
a system like this would prevent

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:02.670
those difficulties from
arising in the first place.

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.400
It would teach them well in fifth grade.

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:09.030
But even if it didn't do that, if we
had a intelligent tutoring system that

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:12.720
worked with them throughout their
entire education, it would be able to

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.220
look back and say what did I
teach you back in fifth grade?

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:16.750
What difficulties did you have there?

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:18.000
And kind of leverage those right now.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.920
I know that this student has always had
a little bit of trouble with fractions.

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.245
So when I come to a new lesson I know
that I can anticipate giving a little

00:03:24.245 --> 00:03:25.570
bit more feedback on that.

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:28.460
And couching it in terms of what
I've told them in the past.

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:33.060
So, that kind of long term memory, that
kind of massive data bank really opens

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:36.660
up some really exciting possibilities if
we can figure out a way to harness it.

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:37.160
&gt;&gt; Oh, wow.

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:38.110
Absolutely.

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:40.269
&gt;&gt; What are some of the biggest
challenges facing intelligent

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:41.010
tutoring systems?

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:43.676
&gt;&gt; So, I think there's really two big
challenges that are presently facing

00:03:43.676 --> 00:03:44.880
intelligent tutoring systems.

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:47.503
One is the idea of
invisible information.

00:03:47.503 --> 00:03:49.440
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.
&gt;&gt; So when I'm working with a student

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:52.160
and they're working on a particular
problem, I can see the steps they're

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:54.800
writing out, that that is their first
step, that is their second step.

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:55.630
But when they make an error,

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:58.120
I don't necessarily know what
was going on inside their mind.

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:01.240
I can kind of use what they said and
use what they wrote to try and

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:04.870
extrapolate it, but
I don't have a real notion of that.

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:08.094
That comes up in things like algebra,
but it's even more important in things

00:04:08.094 --> 00:04:10.290
like science or
some of the more high level classes.

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:13.110
Ideally, we like to build intelligent
tutoring systems that deal with those

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:14.410
levels as well.

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:18.690
When the nature of the problems
themselves becomes much less formal and

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:20.529
much less structured.

00:04:20.529 --> 00:04:21.980
And in an algebra problem,
I know that there's,

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:24.480
you know, five steps to get to
the answer to this problem.

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:28.180
But if my problem is,
design a good user interface for

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:32.100
facilitating learning sign language,
I don't know what the problems are.

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:33.100
I don't know what the steps are.

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:35.270
I don't know how to evaluate that.

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:38.160
And so, for those big, open-ended
projects or those big things that aren't

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:41.320
really constrained environments, that's
where we have a lot of information

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:43.270
that's invisible, because it's
inside the student's own head.

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:45.880
And that makes it very difficult for
humans to operate on,

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:47.020
let alone computers.

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:48.530
If they can't see it,
they can't operate on it.

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:50.660
&gt;&gt; Right.
&gt;&gt; And then the other issue is that

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:53.900
there's information that we as
humans can process that right now,

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:55.690
it's difficult for agents to process.

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:56.310
&gt;&gt; For sure.

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:57.590
&gt;&gt; So when I'm working with a student,

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:59.940
I can tell based on their facial
expression, are they bored,

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:02.190
are they tired, are they really excited,
are they really confused,

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:03.570
are they really frustrated.

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:05.430
And those all inform
how I react to them.

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:07.130
If they're frustrated,
I'm going to be a little more patient.

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:09.720
If they're excited, I'm going to
maybe push a little bit further or

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:11.530
connect to some bigger topics.

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:14.690
Right now, computers are starting to
have a little bit of ability to do that

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:17.200
kind of facial recognition, but
it's not quite there yet and

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:20.000
it's not fast enough
to equip a tutor with.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.450
And so the other challenge that those
systems are really going to face is

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:28.200
processing the full range of information
that we humans can process or

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:31.300
reading the student, understanding that,
understanding a little bit about their

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:35.000
background and
the context in which they're working.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.028
So I think those are the two main
challenges that they'll need to

00:05:38.028 --> 00:05:38.640
overcome.

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:39.800
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:41.100
&gt;&gt; So, thank you again, Jason for

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:43.020
peppering me with
questions on my own topic.

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:45.925
&gt;&gt; Absolutely David,
anything for you, you know that.

00:05:45.925 --> 00:05:47.192
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And thank you all.
