00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:03.440
For much of this class we will be working with the data set of

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:05.540
World Cup game statistics.

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:09.740
Each row of our data set represents a single World Cup game,

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:11.650
excluding preliminary games.

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:15.360
And each column represents some piece of information on the game.

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.160
Here we have the year of the World Cup in which the game was played,

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.170
the time the game happened at.

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:25.520
The full date including the day and the month.

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:28.910
The two teams that played, team 1 and team 2.

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:33.670
The number of people who attended the match in person at the stadium.

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:37.030
Which stage of the World Cup the match occurred in.

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:39.120
The final score of the game.

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.050
The first number representing Team 1's score.

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:45.410
And the second number representing Team 2's score.

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:48.490
And whether or not the game went to penalty kicks.

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:53.270
One point on this is that penalty kicks only happen if the game was

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:55.720
tied by the time it ended.

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:58.640
Which chart, type of the charts we've covered earlier in

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:03.750
this lesson do you think is most suited to present the total attendance for

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.230
a given year of the World Cup?

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:09.530
In other words, you would aggregate all the rows of the games for

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:13.830
the same year and sum up the attendance for every one of those games.

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.820
And also think about, why would you choose that chart?

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.640
Please choose only one of the chart types below that you think

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.770
best represents the data, and also think about why you've chosen that chart.
