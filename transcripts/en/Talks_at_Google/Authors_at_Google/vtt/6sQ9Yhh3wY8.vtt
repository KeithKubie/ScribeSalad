JONATHAN: Good
morning, and welcome

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:12.070
to Talks at Google in
Cambridge, Massachusetts.

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:16.230
Today it's my great pleasure
to introduce Ethan Zuckerman.

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.970
Ethan directs the Center
for Civic Media at MIT,

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:23.340
and he teaches at
MIT's Media Lab.

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.530
He's the co-founder of the
global blogging community

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:29.890
Global Voices, and he
works with social change

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:33.560
nonprofit organizations
around the world.

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:36.930
Much of his research centers
on quantitative analysis

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.960
of media, computational
techniques to determine who,

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:44.900
what, and where feature in
traditional and participatory

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:46.440
media.

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.840
He's here today to discuss
his book, "Rewire, Digital

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:52.660
Cosmopolitans in the
Age of Connection,"

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:58.080
now in paperback, which you've
never seen before today, so

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:02.300
small secondary thing, the
book which "Publisher's Weekly"

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.480
called "a fascinating and
powerful reflection on what

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:09.820
it means to be a citizen of
the world in the internet age."

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:12.180
Please join me in
welcoming Ethan Zuckerman.

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.221
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:15.221 --> 00:01:16.970
ETHAN ZUCKERMAN: Thanks
so much, Jonathan.

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:18.511
And thanks, everyone,
for coming out.

00:01:18.511 --> 00:01:20.090
I really appreciate it.

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:22.670
Obviously it's an arduous
trek from across the street

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:23.390
to be with you.

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:28.210
So as you guys know,
I'm sure, writing

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:29.640
is a bit of an isolated process.

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.910
And so you go into this
cave for 12 to 18 months,

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:37.310
and you shut everything
out of your head

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:38.726
when you try to
get the book out.

00:01:38.726 --> 00:01:40.350
And then you put this
book out, and you

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.690
hope that the book
is still relevant.

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:46.902
You hope that the ideas
that you put forward still

00:01:46.902 --> 00:01:47.860
help explain the world.

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:50.420
So I was really
gratified shortly

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.800
after the book came out to get
a story that sort of summed

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.570
up for me the core point
that I was trying to make.

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:58.539
And as it happens,
it's a Google story.

00:01:58.539 --> 00:02:00.580
So I didn't make this up
especially for you guys.

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:02.205
This is the story
that I've been trying

00:02:02.205 --> 00:02:04.710
to tell people to get a
sense for the phenomenon

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:05.820
that I'm talking about.

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.330
But it centers on
this guy Hugo Barra,

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.490
who's quite senior at Google,
working on the Nexus product,

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:16.180
very much the person who would
stand up and show everyone

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.000
where this remarkable
phone was going.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.350
And you guys may remember
about 18 months ago

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:24.040
he announced that he was
going to leave Google.

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.160
And specifically he was
leaving Google for Xiaomi.

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.800
And Xiaomi was a company
that at that point

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.040
most Americans, including a lot
of Americans in the tech press,

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.120
knew very, very little about.

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:43.440
And so there was something
of a buzz in the tech press

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:44.960
around the idea
that someone would

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:49.300
leave this incredibly
prestigious job at Google

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:53.290
and go work for a Chinese
mobile phone manufacturer.

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:56.070
And so the tech press did
what they're so good at doing.

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:58.540
They actually dug deep down.

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:01.820
They found the story
behind the story.

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:04.000
And they started publishing
stories explaining

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.060
that what had
actually happened was

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:11.600
that Hugo Barra had
found himself involved

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:15.730
in a complicated love
triangle with Sergey Brin.

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:18.320
And of course, if you had
been dating a Googler,

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:20.460
and that Googler ended
up dating Sergey Brin,

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:24.240
there was only one logical
thing you could do.

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:27.730
You had to leave the United
States and go to a place

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:30.110
where Google's drones
couldn't reach.

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:32.620
And you were suddenly
outside of the orbit

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:34.190
of where Google
had any influence.

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:36.390
And this was obviously
the only thing

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:40.045
that could explain Barra
would give up a dream job

00:03:40.045 --> 00:03:42.420
and find himself going to work
for a Chinese mobile phone

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:43.770
manufacturer.

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:47.450
And this got reported with a
fair amount of seriousness.

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:51.420
You can look this up and you can
find the stories of this triad.

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:55.950
And so Barra took to the
stage at LeWeb last winter,

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:59.870
and he said, guys, you
really just don't get this.

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:03.280
If you want to be working on
tech right now, particularly

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:05.690
if you want to be
working on mobile tech,

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:09.110
it's an amazing
time to be in China.

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:10.830
And it's not just
an amazing time

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:13.350
to be in China
because you're looking

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:16.200
at 500 million people
on the internet,

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:19.707
you're looking at this
massive emergent middle class.

00:04:19.707 --> 00:04:21.290
It's not just a great
time to be there

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:23.952
because Xiaomi is actually
a pretty interesting company

00:04:23.952 --> 00:04:26.410
and doing innovative things on
top of the Android operating

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:28.870
system and building
really beautiful phones

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:31.980
and running them in small runs
on a unique business model.

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:34.020
It's an interesting
time to be in China

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:36.620
because the Chinese
internet does not

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:39.630
look a whole lot
like the US internet.

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:42.060
And in fact, a lot
of the tools that

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:44.390
have become dominant
in the Chinese internet

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:48.160
actually don't have
very neat US parallels.

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:51.130
We talk often about Weibo
as being sort of Twitter

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:51.920
on steroids.

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:56.560
It's actually significantly more
interesting in political terms.

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:59.700
It's really become sort of the
space for public discourse.

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:03.780
WeChat with the circles model
has done something that even

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:07.400
Google has actually had trouble
getting across with Plus,

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:10.270
but a really different
model for communication

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:12.640
within small groups
that's worked very well.

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:18.370
Alipay has brought digital cash
into ordinary, everyday use

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:20.210
in a way that, again,
isn't all that common

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:22.670
at this point in
the US or in Europe.

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:25.270
As much as we may be impressed
by what our friends over Amazon

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:28.230
are doing as far
as delivery, JD.com

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:31.780
putting things on people's desks
within four hours of ordering

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:35.240
is really an order of
magnitude beyond this.

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:37.410
And so I don't
expect these stories

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:39.500
to be particularly surprising
in a room like this.

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:42.950
But generally what I'm going
out and talking about what's

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:44.640
going on on the
Chinese internet,

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:46.640
I get a whole lot of
bafflement, because there's

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:50.620
this sense in which we
expect the Chinese internet

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:55.960
to be boring and stultified and
censored and non-generative.

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:57.860
And in fact, in
many ways it's one

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:01.900
of the most interesting spaces
that's going on right now.

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:05.091
And so I'm not actually here to
talk about the Chinese internet

00:06:05.091 --> 00:06:07.340
and why we should take the
Chinese internet seriously,

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:10.310
although it's a fun topic
and an interesting one.

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:14.270
What I really want to talk
about is this broader notion

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:17.100
that I've been wrestling
with in this book, which

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:20.600
is this possibility that atoms
may, under circumstances, be

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:22.620
more mobile than bits.

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:26.360
We're actually remarkably
connected to China

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:28.690
in terms of getting stuff
in and out of China.

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:31.670
We've all gotten our
heads used to the idea

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:34.510
that we are engaged
in supply chains that

00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:36.792
are deeply global in form.

00:06:36.792 --> 00:06:38.250
And you start
thinking about what's

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:40.470
involved with building the
laptop that I'm presenting

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:44.320
from, and you're involving
50 or 60 countries.

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:47.010
You've got container ships
moving between all of them.

00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:51.770
And this sort of miracle of
a designed-in-California,

00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:54.870
made-in-China,
delivered-directly-to-me

00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:59.960
product gives you a sense of
just how connected these sort

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:01.710
of networks have been.

00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:04.150
What's interesting
is that I'm making

00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:06.950
the argument in this book
that the digital networks that

00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:11.660
tie us together don't
actually work as effectively.

00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:14.030
And the way to get
this is you can't

00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:17.830
think about these networks
in terms of potential.

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:20.820
You have to think about
them in terms of flow.

00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:22.430
You can't just
think about the idea

00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:24.990
that in theory we're
capable of getting

00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:26.760
all sorts of
information out of China

00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:29.350
or all sorts of information
out of Sub-Saharan Africa.

00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:34.610
What I'm really asking is, where
does that information flow?

00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:37.752
It's really hard to map flow.

00:07:37.752 --> 00:07:39.210
We get it a little
bit when we look

00:07:39.210 --> 00:07:42.550
at a map like a
visualization of traffic.

00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:44.809
And we look at the
city of Cambridge,

00:07:44.809 --> 00:07:46.600
but we also look at
where you want to drive

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:49.272
and where you don't want
to drive at that point.

00:07:49.272 --> 00:07:50.980
This is a map of air
routes that actually

00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:53.620
does a nice job of flow.

00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:56.180
You get out of it is a
sense that you can probably

00:07:56.180 --> 00:07:57.712
get to any point in the world.

00:07:57.712 --> 00:08:00.170
But if you start looking for
where it's particularly thick,

00:08:00.170 --> 00:08:01.910
where it's
particularly connected,

00:08:01.910 --> 00:08:03.700
you start getting
very good indicators

00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:07.200
of where people
actually go in practice.

00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:10.190
But even a map like
this tends to disguise

00:08:10.190 --> 00:08:12.527
a little bit what's going on.

00:08:12.527 --> 00:08:14.610
What actually happens when
you look at air traffic

00:08:14.610 --> 00:08:17.060
is that about 90%
of it is domestic.

00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:20.080
It's actually almost
a rounding error,

00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:21.700
the international traffic.

00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:24.410
We think about it when we start
thinking about how we interact

00:08:24.410 --> 00:08:25.480
with people from
other countries.

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:27.896
We think about it when we think
about how disease spreads.

00:08:27.896 --> 00:08:30.520
We think about it when we think
about just-in-time delivery.

00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:35.110
But in fact, the vast majority
of this ends up being domestic.

00:08:35.110 --> 00:08:38.190
And what I'm finding is
that the same thing ends up

00:08:38.190 --> 00:08:42.054
happening when we start dealing
with flows of information.

00:08:42.054 --> 00:08:44.720
By the way, I have to think that
this is one of the great intern

00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:46.280
projects of all time, right?

00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:48.960
This guy Paul Butler
goes over to Facebook,

00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:51.400
says I'd like to map
Facebook, gets enough data

00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:53.430
that he's able to do
this visualization.

00:08:53.430 --> 00:08:56.740
You can find Zuckerberg
pointing to this map

00:08:56.740 --> 00:09:00.450
every single time he talks about
Facebook's global ambitions.

00:09:00.450 --> 00:09:02.610
So just in terms of
like constructing

00:09:02.610 --> 00:09:04.580
a map as rhetorical
document, I have

00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:06.400
to think that this is
sort of a fun thing.

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:08.900
But what this map very
clearly wants to tell

00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:12.970
you is that Facebook is this
incredibly global network.

00:09:12.970 --> 00:09:15.550
What it actually doesn't do a
very good job of telling you

00:09:15.550 --> 00:09:19.150
is how much of that
traffic on that network

00:09:19.150 --> 00:09:21.970
is people who are
literally in the same town,

00:09:21.970 --> 00:09:25.060
in the same city,
in the same country.

00:09:25.060 --> 00:09:29.180
We've got this illusion, this
vision of the cosmopolitan

00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:32.230
by looking at a network that
theoretically connects us all.

00:09:32.230 --> 00:09:34.420
But when we start
asking this question--

00:09:34.420 --> 00:09:36.560
where are we actually
getting our information?--

00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:39.440
what are we actually paying
attention to?-- are we hearing

00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:42.770
the story about Xiaomi?-- are
we hearing about Ebola before it

00:09:42.770 --> 00:09:45.280
becomes a crisis?--
in many cases,

00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:49.040
we're actually dealing with a
remarkably disconnected world.

00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:52.200
And for me, what I
study much of the time

00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:55.014
is what we pay attention
to in news media.

00:09:55.014 --> 00:09:55.930
And so this is a tool.

00:09:55.930 --> 00:09:57.388
This is actually
publicly available

00:09:57.388 --> 00:09:59.000
if you want to play
around with it.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:04.530
We are scraping 50,000
media sources in the US

00:10:04.530 --> 00:10:05.905
and then doing
visualizations day

00:10:05.905 --> 00:10:08.850
to day based on our own
geocoding coming out of it just

00:10:08.850 --> 00:10:11.930
to get a sense of what
we're paying attention to

00:10:11.930 --> 00:10:15.780
and the incredible imbalance
between domestic news

00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:16.980
and international news.

00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:18.960
In some senses it makes sense.

00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:20.770
Everybody pays more
attention to what's

00:10:20.770 --> 00:10:23.130
going on domestically than
they do internationally.

00:10:23.130 --> 00:10:26.620
But the extent to
which, at a moment where

00:10:26.620 --> 00:10:29.280
it's almost possible to get
information from anywhere,

00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:31.170
we have a tendency
to be overwhelmed

00:10:31.170 --> 00:10:35.260
by domestic information, is to
me sort of a surprising one.

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:39.660
But I want to talk about
why I'm interested in this.

00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:44.160
And for me, it has a lot
to do with my own history.

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:46.460
I got involved with building
internet-based businesses

00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:49.080
in 1994.

00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:51.730
I was the founding CTO for
a company called Tripod.com,

00:10:51.730 --> 00:10:53.870
which did homepage hosting.

00:10:53.870 --> 00:10:56.267
It get swallowed by Lycos.

00:10:56.267 --> 00:10:58.600
like: Lycos got sold off into
a million different parts.

00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:02.010
But a lot of the
things that people

00:11:02.010 --> 00:11:04.210
working on user-generated
content businesses

00:11:04.210 --> 00:11:08.350
are dealing with now we were
dealing with in the late 1990s.

00:11:08.350 --> 00:11:10.296
I came out of that
and said, well,

00:11:10.296 --> 00:11:11.420
this is really interesting.

00:11:11.420 --> 00:11:13.664
We built a really
big company that

00:11:13.664 --> 00:11:16.080
was the eighth largest site
on the web for a little while.

00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:18.220
We built it in a
town of 8,000 people

00:11:18.220 --> 00:11:19.730
in northwestern Massachusetts.

00:11:19.730 --> 00:11:22.856
I wonder if we could
do it in West Africa.

00:11:22.856 --> 00:11:24.730
Because of course that's
a logical next step.

00:11:24.730 --> 00:11:26.720
It's western Mass, West Africa.

00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:31.890
So I started a group that
invited technology volunteers

00:11:31.890 --> 00:11:34.440
to come over for three
to six months at a time

00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:36.910
and work in start-up
businesses in West Africa

00:11:36.910 --> 00:11:40.030
and try to do tech transfer
and help businesses get off

00:11:40.030 --> 00:11:41.340
the ground.

00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:46.550
And believe it or not,
this is in 1999 one

00:11:46.550 --> 00:11:49.390
of the hottest businesses
on the continent.

00:11:49.390 --> 00:11:52.500
This is Joy Online,
which has turned

00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:55.160
into Ghana's main
international portal.

00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:58.150
If you're a Ghanaian living
anywhere else in the world,

00:11:58.150 --> 00:12:00.790
this is your source of news
and commerce and revenue.

00:12:00.790 --> 00:12:03.370
This is your connection
to the rest of the world.

00:12:03.370 --> 00:12:05.250
And so I was hanging
out in Accra, Ghana

00:12:05.250 --> 00:12:07.850
with these businesses and
seeing amazing things,

00:12:07.850 --> 00:12:10.740
people building really
fascinating businesses,

00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:13.360
high levels of technical
sophistication,

00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:16.050
wondering why the world
hadn't figured out

00:12:16.050 --> 00:12:18.670
that Ghana was going to
be a great destination

00:12:18.670 --> 00:12:19.950
for outsourcing.

00:12:19.950 --> 00:12:23.010
And then something really
interesting happened.

00:12:23.010 --> 00:12:28.070
Ghana had an election, a
really good election in 2000,

00:12:28.070 --> 00:12:30.310
elected this guy John Kufuor.

00:12:30.310 --> 00:12:31.850
And Kufuor was an
interesting guy.

00:12:31.850 --> 00:12:34.250
He came from the opposition
party, the party that

00:12:34.250 --> 00:12:36.540
had been in power for
more than 20 years,

00:12:36.540 --> 00:12:38.530
gave up power voluntarily.

00:12:38.530 --> 00:12:41.520
This guy got elected in an
election that was universally

00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:44.604
seen as free and fair.

00:12:44.604 --> 00:12:46.520
And as you can tell, it
dominated all the news

00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:48.110
in the newspapers.

00:12:48.110 --> 00:12:50.170
So we, just to
remind you in 2000,

00:12:50.170 --> 00:12:54.020
were having a bit of an iffy
election here, Bush v. Gore,

00:12:54.020 --> 00:12:56.190
didn't go actually
all that smoothly.

00:12:56.190 --> 00:12:57.720
It was actually
going so badly here

00:12:57.720 --> 00:13:02.160
that Ghana offered election
observers to come down

00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:05.360
to Florida to try to help
them run this election.

00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:08.640
And unfortunately, this
incredibly good news story

00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:10.890
out of Africa ended
up getting something

00:13:10.890 --> 00:13:14.139
like 200 words in
the "New York Times."

00:13:14.139 --> 00:13:16.180
And I was looking at this
and essentially saying,

00:13:16.180 --> 00:13:19.050
there is no way that I
can do what I'm doing.

00:13:19.050 --> 00:13:21.590
There's no way that
I can figure out

00:13:21.590 --> 00:13:23.660
how to get American
companies to take Sub-Saharan

00:13:23.660 --> 00:13:26.300
Africa seriously
unless we start looking

00:13:26.300 --> 00:13:29.240
at this question of what
we pay attention to.

00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:31.530
And so I started
a scholarly career

00:13:31.530 --> 00:13:34.720
looking at this question
of, how do we pay attention

00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:35.906
to the rest of the world?

00:13:35.906 --> 00:13:37.530
And what's been really
weird about this

00:13:37.530 --> 00:13:42.160
is there's a huge shrinkage
in international attention.

00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:45.880
If you looked at international
newscasting in the 1970s,

00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:48.390
at least one out
of three stories

00:13:48.390 --> 00:13:49.516
was an international story.

00:13:49.516 --> 00:13:51.265
Now, there's some
reasons for this, right?

00:13:51.265 --> 00:13:53.610
This is the height of the
Vietnam War, a lot of this

00:13:53.610 --> 00:13:55.870
is America's
involvement in Vietnam.

00:13:55.870 --> 00:13:59.080
But there was a lot more
international attention

00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:00.950
at that particular
moment in time.

00:14:00.950 --> 00:14:04.241
And this erosion in
broadcast coverage

00:14:04.241 --> 00:14:05.740
is due to a lot of
different things.

00:14:05.740 --> 00:14:07.400
It's due to cost.

00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:10.070
It's a lot cheaper to
cover domestic events.

00:14:10.070 --> 00:14:11.700
To a funny extent,
politicians sort

00:14:11.700 --> 00:14:13.790
of cover themselves,
as do celebrities,

00:14:13.790 --> 00:14:16.860
whereas wars actually require
you get out on the ground.

00:14:16.860 --> 00:14:18.600
This has happened not
just in broadcast.

00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:23.030
We've replicated this finding in
print in the UK and in the US.

00:14:23.030 --> 00:14:26.490
We've seen a 45% decrease in
coverage of international news

00:14:26.490 --> 00:14:30.716
stories between the
1970s to the last decade.

00:14:30.716 --> 00:14:32.090
And when you think
about it, this

00:14:32.090 --> 00:14:35.240
goes completely
counter to what we

00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:37.550
would expect from
the technology.

00:14:37.550 --> 00:14:40.940
We would expect that in
the 1960s and 1970s when

00:14:40.940 --> 00:14:45.710
it was incredibly challenging
to go and get these stories--

00:14:45.710 --> 00:14:49.470
you had to go to
Vietnam, shoot on film,

00:14:49.470 --> 00:14:52.680
put the film in a canister,
ship it across an ocean,

00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:56.390
develop it, and then put it up
for broadcast-- that we would

00:14:56.390 --> 00:14:59.460
have a lot more information
coming out at a moment

00:14:59.460 --> 00:15:03.170
where you can put a crew on the
ground with a satellite phone,

00:15:03.170 --> 00:15:06.480
with a camera, get footage
from Haiti within 12

00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:08.520
hours of disaster happening.

00:15:08.520 --> 00:15:11.720
But most the time, that
isn't actually what happens.

00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:14.010
And one of the big reasons
why it doesn't happen

00:15:14.010 --> 00:15:19.160
is that we have a surprisingly
light appetite for news.

00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:21.780
This is work that I did just
scraping off of Ad Planner,

00:15:21.780 --> 00:15:25.050
back when you guys left it
open and I could scrape it,

00:15:25.050 --> 00:15:27.890
just trying to get
a sense for what

00:15:27.890 --> 00:15:32.600
was the appetite for domestic
versus international news

00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:36.340
in the largest internet
markets, so just looking

00:15:36.340 --> 00:15:39.340
at how much attention was
paid to various different news

00:15:39.340 --> 00:15:40.010
sites.

00:15:40.010 --> 00:15:41.610
Turns out that
the US is actually

00:15:41.610 --> 00:15:44.520
quite cosmopolitan in
our news attitudes.

00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:46.790
We pay a lot of
attention to the BBC.

00:15:46.790 --> 00:15:50.070
We have a very large Indian
expatriate population

00:15:50.070 --> 00:15:53.440
that religiously reads
"Times of India."

00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:56.690
But even with that
much internationalism,

00:15:56.690 --> 00:16:01.040
we're at roughly 94%
domestic sources.

00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:04.570
So consider "The Guardian,"
consider the BBC,

00:16:04.570 --> 00:16:05.570
consider all of that.

00:16:05.570 --> 00:16:07.950
We have a strong preference
for the domestic.

00:16:07.950 --> 00:16:11.740
It's much, much stronger in
most other nations, this sort

00:16:11.740 --> 00:16:15.280
of promise that we could
look at the internet,

00:16:15.280 --> 00:16:17.010
and I could read the
"Times of India,"

00:16:17.010 --> 00:16:20.680
I could read various different
Australian or Chinese papers

00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:22.570
depending on my language skills.

00:16:22.570 --> 00:16:24.720
Most of the time
this is not where

00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:27.290
we end up spending
our attention.

00:16:27.290 --> 00:16:30.950
So we end up actually very
dependent on the coverage that

00:16:30.950 --> 00:16:33.100
comes out of mainstream media.

00:16:33.100 --> 00:16:35.780
And that coverage
has had biases that

00:16:35.780 --> 00:16:39.140
have stuck with us for
a very, very long time.

00:16:39.140 --> 00:16:43.530
I've been mapping the "New York
Times" for about 10 years now.

00:16:43.530 --> 00:16:45.500
I actually have to mark
my maps very carefully,

00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:47.390
because I can never
tell by looking at them,

00:16:47.390 --> 00:16:49.770
because the pattern
doesn't really change.

00:16:49.770 --> 00:16:51.490
We're almost always
under-covering

00:16:51.490 --> 00:16:53.010
Sub-Saharan Africa.

00:16:53.010 --> 00:16:55.830
We're very rarely
covering Central Asia.

00:16:55.830 --> 00:16:58.380
We tend to have a very,
very strong interest

00:16:58.380 --> 00:17:00.840
in North America,
Western Europe,

00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:03.509
and increasingly
in India and China.

00:17:03.509 --> 00:17:05.550
But of course, now we're
in a digital age, right?

00:17:05.550 --> 00:17:07.290
So we've got
infinite shelf space.

00:17:07.290 --> 00:17:09.079
We're not constrained
by what comes out

00:17:09.079 --> 00:17:10.819
on the paper "New York Times."

00:17:10.819 --> 00:17:14.080
Now you start seeing something
like the Huffington Post trying

00:17:14.080 --> 00:17:15.579
very, very hard to
internationalize.

00:17:15.579 --> 00:17:17.770
And what you'll see
looking between the two

00:17:17.770 --> 00:17:21.630
is you actually end up
with a much paler map.

00:17:21.630 --> 00:17:25.849
You end up with significantly
less international exposure

00:17:25.849 --> 00:17:28.650
as you start moving from
the Times into HuffPo.

00:17:28.650 --> 00:17:31.869
You actually have a much
stronger concentration

00:17:31.869 --> 00:17:33.660
of stories coming out
of the United States,

00:17:33.660 --> 00:17:35.920
stories coming out of Europe.

00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:37.669
And so this is
why, in many cases,

00:17:37.669 --> 00:17:39.710
people sort of look and
say, well, wait a second.

00:17:39.710 --> 00:17:42.750
OK, so we still
have strong biases

00:17:42.750 --> 00:17:44.462
within existing
mainstream media.

00:17:44.462 --> 00:17:45.920
As we're moving
into digital media,

00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:50.340
we're ending up with possibly an
even more Ameri-centric media.

00:17:50.340 --> 00:17:52.040
What about this graph?

00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:55.610
Aren't we going to get
interesting international news

00:17:55.610 --> 00:17:56.530
through our friends?

00:17:56.530 --> 00:17:59.130
As social kicks
in, aren't we going

00:17:59.130 --> 00:18:00.890
to find out about
really important stories

00:18:00.890 --> 00:18:04.080
because our friends in other
countries know about them?

00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:06.502
So I had the great
good fortune to get

00:18:06.502 --> 00:18:09.460
to interrogate this
data a little bit

00:18:09.460 --> 00:18:12.810
with a guy named Johann Ugander,
who wrote this very, very

00:18:12.810 --> 00:18:16.760
helpful paper on the anatomy
of the Facebook social graph.

00:18:16.760 --> 00:18:19.290
And what this paper
suggests is actually

00:18:19.290 --> 00:18:21.940
a pretty surprising to
folks like me who study

00:18:21.940 --> 00:18:23.440
international contact.

00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:27.499
It's suggested that 15% of
the relationships on Facebook

00:18:27.499 --> 00:18:28.790
cross international boundaries.

00:18:28.790 --> 00:18:31.331
And I found myself looking at
this and going, that's amazing.

00:18:31.331 --> 00:18:33.450
That's so much
higher than we would

00:18:33.450 --> 00:18:35.980
get in any other
sort of statistic.

00:18:35.980 --> 00:18:37.564
And so we hammered
at it a little bit.

00:18:37.564 --> 00:18:39.813
And as we hammered at it,
we discovered, first of all,

00:18:39.813 --> 00:18:41.370
that a lot of this
was coding error.

00:18:41.370 --> 00:18:44.760
It's actually closer to 10%
that was actually international.

00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:48.790
And that 10% international
is actually highly clustered.

00:18:48.790 --> 00:18:51.290
To the extent that Scandinavians
hang out with other people,

00:18:51.290 --> 00:18:52.915
they hang out with
other Scandinavians.

00:18:52.915 --> 00:18:54.910
To the extent that
people in South America

00:18:54.910 --> 00:18:56.080
hang out with other
people online,

00:18:56.080 --> 00:18:57.260
it's other people
in South America.

00:18:57.260 --> 00:18:59.301
And that's more or less
what this graph shows us.

00:18:59.301 --> 00:19:03.470
But what we found that was
most remarkable in this

00:19:03.470 --> 00:19:07.370
is that the average
person has more like 2%

00:19:07.370 --> 00:19:10.800
to 3% international ties
rather than 10% to 12%

00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:12.110
international ties.

00:19:12.110 --> 00:19:17.560
And the reason for this is
if you are a Norwegian living

00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:19.480
and working in
the United States,

00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:22.504
you show up as having 80%
or 90% international ties

00:19:22.504 --> 00:19:24.670
within this data set, because
you're using something

00:19:24.670 --> 00:19:27.710
like Facebook to stay in
touch with everyone at home.

00:19:27.710 --> 00:19:31.060
So you may be what we refer
to as a bridge figure.

00:19:31.060 --> 00:19:34.850
You may be someone who is able
to bring interesting stories

00:19:34.850 --> 00:19:37.520
from Norway and bring
it into a US audience

00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:40.950
if that US audience is capable
of paying attention to it.

00:19:40.950 --> 00:19:46.100
But you are a very, very small
subset of the population.

00:19:46.100 --> 00:19:47.910
And the rest of
that population is

00:19:47.910 --> 00:19:52.260
dealing with a social network
delivering them stories

00:19:52.260 --> 00:19:54.410
and delivering them
information that's

00:19:54.410 --> 00:19:58.340
really governed by the
phenomenon of homophily.

00:19:58.340 --> 00:20:00.210
So homophily was a
word that I didn't

00:20:00.210 --> 00:20:03.040
know before I sat down to
start writing this book.

00:20:03.040 --> 00:20:04.780
When I found myself
dealing with it,

00:20:04.780 --> 00:20:08.680
it unlocked a whole trove of
sociological literature for me.

00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:10.920
Turns out that homophily,
which is basically

00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:14.020
the tendency of birds of a
feather to flock together,

00:20:14.020 --> 00:20:19.010
is probably the best
documented finding

00:20:19.010 --> 00:20:21.090
in contemporary sociology.

00:20:21.090 --> 00:20:25.750
People are incredibly
good at self-selecting

00:20:25.750 --> 00:20:28.500
into comfortable tribes
of one fashion or another.

00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:30.800
We see evidence that in
neighborhoods, people

00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:33.860
will move in next to
people of the same race,

00:20:33.860 --> 00:20:37.350
next to people of similar
socioeconomic status.

00:20:37.350 --> 00:20:41.189
You see the same thing when
you walk into a cafeteria

00:20:41.189 --> 00:20:42.980
and people don't know
each other very well.

00:20:42.980 --> 00:20:46.980
They tend to cluster by visible
characteristics like race.

00:20:46.980 --> 00:20:48.650
But if you actually
interview, you'll

00:20:48.650 --> 00:20:51.560
find out that their
unconsciously very

00:20:51.560 --> 00:20:54.460
good at clustering
themselves by religion,

00:20:54.460 --> 00:20:56.090
by socioeconomic status.

00:20:56.090 --> 00:20:58.000
One of my favorite
papers in this space

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:01.820
looks at students walking
into a computer lab

00:21:01.820 --> 00:21:03.940
and finds that
students end up sitting

00:21:03.940 --> 00:21:07.400
next to people who have
similar facial features.

00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:09.220
If you wear glasses,
you're likely to sit

00:21:09.220 --> 00:21:10.920
down next to someone
who has glasses.

00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:12.710
If you have long
hair, you sit down

00:21:12.710 --> 00:21:14.170
next to someone
who has long hair.

00:21:14.170 --> 00:21:16.003
And when you interview
people after the fact

00:21:16.003 --> 00:21:19.070
to try to explain this, they
say, they looked friendly.

00:21:19.070 --> 00:21:24.066
We're really good at
trying to find our tribe.

00:21:24.066 --> 00:21:25.440
And what's
interesting about this

00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:29.510
is that this tendency to
find our tribe, I think,

00:21:29.510 --> 00:21:32.060
is playing out online as well.

00:21:32.060 --> 00:21:34.550
When we're dealing
with curated media,

00:21:34.550 --> 00:21:38.430
like the "New York Times," we
pay more attention to our tribe

00:21:38.430 --> 00:21:39.760
than to the other tribes.

00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:42.080
We pay more attention to
North America and to Europe

00:21:42.080 --> 00:21:43.660
than we do to anywhere else.

00:21:43.660 --> 00:21:45.650
And in some ways,
the further we get

00:21:45.650 --> 00:21:47.270
in terms of cultural
distance, when

00:21:47.270 --> 00:21:49.760
we're talking about something
like Sub-Saharan Africa,

00:21:49.760 --> 00:21:52.660
you're going to get less
and less information.

00:21:52.660 --> 00:21:56.880
As we move into an era of
choice, where I, as the user,

00:21:56.880 --> 00:21:59.340
say, this is what I
want to know about,

00:21:59.340 --> 00:22:02.490
when I search for something,
when I customize my news,

00:22:02.490 --> 00:22:05.210
anything within that
paradigm basically

00:22:05.210 --> 00:22:10.830
now depends on my ability to
be conscious of my own choices.

00:22:10.830 --> 00:22:15.150
And unconsciously, I'm
likely to pay more attention

00:22:15.150 --> 00:22:17.160
to people who are like me.

00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:19.740
And so when I think about,
give me what's important,

00:22:19.740 --> 00:22:22.600
give me what I need to
know about in the world,

00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:25.990
I am likely to have a somewhat
biased approach to it based

00:22:25.990 --> 00:22:30.480
on my own natural tendencies
to pay attention to my tribe.

00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:34.302
And now as we start moving
into an era of social media,

00:22:34.302 --> 00:22:35.760
it's interesting
that this is going

00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:37.660
to play itself out even further.

00:22:37.660 --> 00:22:42.470
Because most of us have pretty
homophilous social networks.

00:22:42.470 --> 00:22:45.200
We have a strong
bias towards people

00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:48.760
who have the same ideology,
who have the same religion, who

00:22:48.760 --> 00:22:50.620
have the same basic background.

00:22:50.620 --> 00:22:53.380
And if you think about the fact
that a network like Facebook

00:22:53.380 --> 00:22:58.160
starts by literally trying to
recreate your high school class

00:22:58.160 --> 00:23:00.700
and put you back into
your town of origin

00:23:00.700 --> 00:23:02.860
and connect you with
all those people,

00:23:02.860 --> 00:23:07.170
you have a very, very
strong homophilous bias

00:23:07.170 --> 00:23:09.595
to what sort of information
comes in through there.

00:23:09.595 --> 00:23:11.470
Now the argument that
I'm making, by the way,

00:23:11.470 --> 00:23:14.680
is actually pretty different
from Eli Parser's argument

00:23:14.680 --> 00:23:16.790
in "The Filter
Bubble." he's saying

00:23:16.790 --> 00:23:18.740
it's all about the algorithms.

00:23:18.740 --> 00:23:19.780
They're lying to you.

00:23:19.780 --> 00:23:21.927
They're just trying to
give you what you want.

00:23:21.927 --> 00:23:24.260
I'm actually saying the problem
is much worse than that.

00:23:24.260 --> 00:23:27.080
The simple problem
is, because we

00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:31.670
have this very strong natural
tendency to pay attention

00:23:31.670 --> 00:23:34.140
to those who have a
lot in common with us,

00:23:34.140 --> 00:23:37.550
even a completely unbiased, a
completely un-logarithmically

00:23:37.550 --> 00:23:40.650
controlled network, would
still fall into something

00:23:40.650 --> 00:23:43.390
of this homophily trap
that I'm talking about.

00:23:43.390 --> 00:23:45.950
So why should we
care about this?

00:23:45.950 --> 00:23:49.490
I think the big
reason for me to care

00:23:49.490 --> 00:23:53.120
about this is that the really
big, really interesting

00:23:53.120 --> 00:23:57.230
problems probably don't
get solved locally.

00:23:57.230 --> 00:24:00.170
It's very hard to
find someone who

00:24:00.170 --> 00:24:03.960
believes that addressing
climate change in a serious way

00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:06.690
is going to be something
that the US does by itself.

00:24:06.690 --> 00:24:08.285
There may be
technological innovation.

00:24:08.285 --> 00:24:09.660
There may be major
breakthroughs.

00:24:09.660 --> 00:24:12.230
But at the end of the
day, this challenge

00:24:12.230 --> 00:24:16.170
of trying to figure out how
China, how India, how Myanmar,

00:24:16.170 --> 00:24:21.240
how Nigeria industrialize
without having the same carbon

00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:24.850
footprint that we have is an
enormous international problem

00:24:24.850 --> 00:24:27.789
that's actually going to
require us to have conversations

00:24:27.789 --> 00:24:29.830
with the emerging middle
class in those countries

00:24:29.830 --> 00:24:33.350
and try to figure out how to
both meet their aspirations

00:24:33.350 --> 00:24:35.379
and also try to
minimize the impact.

00:24:35.379 --> 00:24:36.920
But I think in some
ways, we actually

00:24:36.920 --> 00:24:39.135
have gotten a much
better example just

00:24:39.135 --> 00:24:40.760
in trying to figure
out what's happened

00:24:40.760 --> 00:24:43.080
with Ebola over the
last couple of months.

00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:45.675
If you spend as much time
reading about West Africa

00:24:45.675 --> 00:24:48.610
as I do-- and I do it, again,
because of my own homophilous

00:24:48.610 --> 00:24:49.360
tendencies, right?

00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:51.340
I hang out with a
lot West Africans.

00:24:51.340 --> 00:24:53.150
I read West African news.

00:24:53.150 --> 00:24:56.710
We knew that this outbreak was
something particularly scary

00:24:56.710 --> 00:25:00.800
and particularly
serious in mid-March.

00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:02.630
But what's interesting
about it is

00:25:02.630 --> 00:25:06.250
that there was almost
no attention to it.

00:25:06.250 --> 00:25:07.970
This is part of the
same suite of tools

00:25:07.970 --> 00:25:09.053
that I was showing before.

00:25:09.053 --> 00:25:10.900
This is the media
cloud set of tools.

00:25:10.900 --> 00:25:16.170
And what I'm looking at here is
the 25 largest-audience US News

00:25:16.170 --> 00:25:17.270
sources.

00:25:17.270 --> 00:25:21.300
And what I'm looking at here is
a search for Ebola and Guinea,

00:25:21.300 --> 00:25:23.150
which is that orange line there.

00:25:23.150 --> 00:25:25.670
And you'll see that back
in March, back in April,

00:25:25.670 --> 00:25:28.550
we were talking a little
bit about Ebola in Guinea.

00:25:28.550 --> 00:25:31.484
We have almost nothing
until the crisis really

00:25:31.484 --> 00:25:33.150
starts getting out
of control in Guinea.

00:25:33.150 --> 00:25:35.420
People are really,
really worried

00:25:35.420 --> 00:25:38.120
that large chunks of the country
are going to get knocked out.

00:25:38.120 --> 00:25:39.930
And we're talking
about this in July.

00:25:39.930 --> 00:25:42.320
Now, the blue line,
by contrast, shows you

00:25:42.320 --> 00:25:44.070
how we normally pay
attention to this.

00:25:44.070 --> 00:25:47.520
That's the search string
"Ebola and Texas."

00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:49.490
So as soon as this
hits national borders,

00:25:49.490 --> 00:25:52.080
as soon as this hits
people like us, people

00:25:52.080 --> 00:25:54.420
that we pay attention to,
people that we care about,

00:25:54.420 --> 00:25:57.480
we have this massive
surge in attention.

00:25:57.480 --> 00:25:59.630
The thing is, it's too late.

00:25:59.630 --> 00:26:02.600
This is now actually a
very serious epidemic.

00:26:02.600 --> 00:26:05.200
It's going to affect tens
of thousands of people.

00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:06.990
It's possible that
West Africa is

00:26:06.990 --> 00:26:09.620
going to end up being a
reservoir for this disease

00:26:09.620 --> 00:26:12.250
for some significant
time to come.

00:26:12.250 --> 00:26:14.780
We could have had a
great deal of impact

00:26:14.780 --> 00:26:18.390
on this had we jumped
into it very early on.

00:26:18.390 --> 00:26:21.540
But it's incredibly
hard for epidemics

00:26:21.540 --> 00:26:23.200
to get onto the news agenda.

00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:25.394
They're not like earthquakes,
where happens one day,

00:26:25.394 --> 00:26:27.810
it's an act of God, and everyone
sort of rallies together,

00:26:27.810 --> 00:26:29.514
and let's go save Haiti.

00:26:29.514 --> 00:26:31.180
It's the kind of thing
that you actually

00:26:31.180 --> 00:26:34.180
have to pay attention
to day after day

00:26:34.180 --> 00:26:36.030
and get a sense of
how serious it is.

00:26:36.030 --> 00:26:37.960
And there's a great
story on "Planet Money"

00:26:37.960 --> 00:26:43.010
about why it has proved almost
impossible to raise money

00:26:43.010 --> 00:26:44.810
to fight the Ebola epidemic.

00:26:44.810 --> 00:26:46.900
And instead, what
we have are people

00:26:46.900 --> 00:26:50.260
and in essentially saying,
let's just shut our doors.

00:26:50.260 --> 00:26:54.240
I think Ebola is actually a
lovely example of why this just

00:26:54.240 --> 00:26:56.100
doesn't make any sense.

00:26:56.100 --> 00:26:59.710
We know that people are going
to keep going back and forth.

00:26:59.710 --> 00:27:03.360
We know that people who are
caring for their families

00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:08.170
in West Africa are going to
find ways to cross borders.

00:27:08.170 --> 00:27:11.650
They're going to end up
doing it perhaps by lying.

00:27:11.650 --> 00:27:13.540
And if they lie about
where they've been,

00:27:13.540 --> 00:27:14.920
we're not going to
be able to monitor.

00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:17.253
We're not going to be able
to take people's temperatures

00:27:17.253 --> 00:27:18.530
twice a day for 21 days.

00:27:18.530 --> 00:27:20.050
We're also going
to lose the ability

00:27:20.050 --> 00:27:22.580
to send the medical
personnel who

00:27:22.580 --> 00:27:24.680
want to go over and
actually help with this

00:27:24.680 --> 00:27:26.147
and be able to go
back and forth.

00:27:26.147 --> 00:27:28.230
This is one of these
situations where this tenancy

00:27:28.230 --> 00:27:31.970
to say, we should just
withdraw from the world,

00:27:31.970 --> 00:27:34.110
when you start playing
it through, really

00:27:34.110 --> 00:27:35.930
doesn't make a
whole lot of sense.

00:27:35.930 --> 00:27:38.990
This is a situation that
in a connected world

00:27:38.990 --> 00:27:42.720
we all end up having
some responsibility for.

00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:46.590
But I think the reason
to care about this stuff

00:27:46.590 --> 00:27:48.030
isn't purely negative.

00:27:48.030 --> 00:27:49.940
And where I end
up in the book is

00:27:49.940 --> 00:27:53.130
talking about
affirmative reasons

00:27:53.130 --> 00:27:55.310
why you might want
to be paying more

00:27:55.310 --> 00:27:57.292
attention to the
rest of the world.

00:27:57.292 --> 00:27:58.750
And a lot of this
leans on this guy

00:27:58.750 --> 00:28:01.360
Ron Burt at
University of Chicago.

00:28:01.360 --> 00:28:05.730
And Ron left U Chicago
to go work for Raytheon

00:28:05.730 --> 00:28:07.980
and to pretty much conduct
just one of the greatest

00:28:07.980 --> 00:28:10.060
social science
experiments of all time.

00:28:10.060 --> 00:28:14.300
He got himself hired as a senior
vice president at Raytheon

00:28:14.300 --> 00:28:18.390
just as Raytheon was trying to
integrate five new companies

00:28:18.390 --> 00:28:20.660
that they'd found the money
to pay for after inventing

00:28:20.660 --> 00:28:22.430
the Patriot missile.

00:28:22.430 --> 00:28:25.530
And so you've got a
giant defense contractor

00:28:25.530 --> 00:28:28.200
trying to figure out its
own internal structure,

00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:30.700
how does it work
and how do ideas

00:28:30.700 --> 00:28:32.780
spread within the company.

00:28:32.780 --> 00:28:34.110
So he takes one department.

00:28:34.110 --> 00:28:36.620
He takes Internal Purchasing.

00:28:36.620 --> 00:28:39.840
And he interviews everybody
in the entire company,

00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:41.980
more than 1,000
people, and says,

00:28:41.980 --> 00:28:44.360
write down your best idea.

00:28:44.360 --> 00:28:46.650
How would you make
Raytheon better?

00:28:46.650 --> 00:28:48.010
People write them up.

00:28:48.010 --> 00:28:49.100
He anonymizes them.

00:28:49.100 --> 00:28:51.712
He puts them in front
of senior management.

00:28:51.712 --> 00:28:54.400
Senior management ranks
all of these ideas,

00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:56.500
identifies the people
within the organization

00:28:56.500 --> 00:28:58.100
who have the best ideas.

00:28:58.100 --> 00:29:01.900
And he tries to figure out
what this might correlate to.

00:29:01.900 --> 00:29:05.030
You would hope that this would
correlate to your highest

00:29:05.030 --> 00:29:07.730
ranking people, your
most experienced people.

00:29:07.730 --> 00:29:11.471
The answer is no, actually--
fairly loose correlation

00:29:11.471 --> 00:29:13.720
between whether you've been
with Raytheon for a while,

00:29:13.720 --> 00:29:15.678
whether you're in a senior
management position,

00:29:15.678 --> 00:29:17.650
whether you have a
good idea or not.

00:29:17.650 --> 00:29:21.870
It correlates incredibly
closely to the sociogram

00:29:21.870 --> 00:29:23.660
of the organization.

00:29:23.660 --> 00:29:27.920
If you are a bridge
between structural holes,

00:29:27.920 --> 00:29:32.260
if you are someone who travels
between different offices,

00:29:32.260 --> 00:29:34.890
if you are the person
in the Hong Kong office

00:29:34.890 --> 00:29:37.550
who is in touch every day
with the Honolulu office,

00:29:37.550 --> 00:29:39.900
if you are someone who has
moved throughout the company

00:29:39.900 --> 00:29:42.580
and so you have ties in a
lot of different offices,

00:29:42.580 --> 00:29:46.650
you are at, as Bert puts
it, an alarmingly high risk

00:29:46.650 --> 00:29:48.470
of having good ideas.

00:29:48.470 --> 00:29:50.710
He's able to look at
this whole organization

00:29:50.710 --> 00:29:54.620
and essentially say, we
think the best ideas,

00:29:54.620 --> 00:29:58.830
as judged by management, are
coming from the people who

00:29:58.830 --> 00:30:02.090
have the access to the most
diverse ways of looking

00:30:02.090 --> 00:30:03.446
at a problem.

00:30:03.446 --> 00:30:04.820
And he ends up
coming out of this

00:30:04.820 --> 00:30:06.240
with a really
interesting theory.

00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:11.580
He says, creativity is an
import-export business,

00:30:11.580 --> 00:30:14.980
that we think about
genius in terms

00:30:14.980 --> 00:30:17.800
of being Picasso and being able
to see the world in an entirely

00:30:17.800 --> 00:30:18.830
different way.

00:30:18.830 --> 00:30:21.570
But what genius is
most of the time

00:30:21.570 --> 00:30:23.620
is taking something
that's incredibly

00:30:23.620 --> 00:30:25.870
ordinary in another
setting and putting it

00:30:25.870 --> 00:30:28.300
into a totally
different setting.

00:30:28.300 --> 00:30:31.020
And as it turns out, I'm not
just randomly juxtaposing

00:30:31.020 --> 00:30:33.730
Picasso and a mask from Benin.

00:30:33.730 --> 00:30:38.070
Picasso started collecting
West African artwork shortly

00:30:38.070 --> 00:30:39.770
before he invented cubism.

00:30:39.770 --> 00:30:42.825
And if you think about
Cubism, what it largely is,

00:30:42.825 --> 00:30:45.770
is about taking these
sort of geometric shapes

00:30:45.770 --> 00:30:47.900
that come out of
African mask-making

00:30:47.900 --> 00:30:50.510
and bring it into
high art painting.

00:30:50.510 --> 00:30:55.620
Burt suggests that one of
our ways to try to be Picasso

00:30:55.620 --> 00:30:59.671
is to try to figure out how
to diversify those information

00:30:59.671 --> 00:31:00.170
networks.

00:31:00.170 --> 00:31:03.830
How do we amplify our
cognitive diversity?

00:31:03.830 --> 00:31:06.180
How do we make sure
that we are interacting

00:31:06.180 --> 00:31:10.560
with enough different people
who see a problem in enough

00:31:10.560 --> 00:31:13.810
different ways that we're
able to actually approach it

00:31:13.810 --> 00:31:16.200
from multiple
different approaches?

00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:18.330
So I've been working
on this question,

00:31:18.330 --> 00:31:22.940
this question of, how would
we build an internet that's

00:31:22.940 --> 00:31:27.590
good for looking at the entire
world, for the last 10 years

00:31:27.590 --> 00:31:29.040
or so.

00:31:29.040 --> 00:31:30.712
And I'm really bad at it.

00:31:30.712 --> 00:31:32.170
And one of the
reasons why it's fun

00:31:32.170 --> 00:31:34.990
to come to a place like
this is because the things

00:31:34.990 --> 00:31:38.030
that I've done so far
have been so remarkably,

00:31:38.030 --> 00:31:40.770
dramatically unsuccessful.

00:31:40.770 --> 00:31:42.800
This is the dramatically
unsuccessful project

00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:45.170
I've been working
on for 10 years.

00:31:45.170 --> 00:31:47.220
This is a community
called Global Voices.

00:31:47.220 --> 00:31:51.450
It's about 1,200 volunteers
in about 130 countries.

00:31:51.450 --> 00:31:55.170
They put out a daily
newsletter of what's

00:31:55.170 --> 00:31:58.090
going on in social media
all over the world.

00:31:58.090 --> 00:32:01.690
And so if people
right now in Djibouti

00:32:01.690 --> 00:32:05.000
are talking about whether the
overthrow of the government

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:09.130
in Burkina Faso provides
a model for Djiboutians

00:32:09.130 --> 00:32:11.505
to rise up against their
government, we've got it.

00:32:11.505 --> 00:32:14.660
And that happens to be the
lead story this morning.

00:32:14.660 --> 00:32:18.234
If people are talking
about pop music in Ukraine,

00:32:18.234 --> 00:32:19.900
and that was a lead
story the other day,

00:32:19.900 --> 00:32:21.330
that's what we've got out there.

00:32:21.330 --> 00:32:25.000
And our whole idea behind this
was we'd go after the supply.

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:27.610
We would basically
say, we know that we've

00:32:27.610 --> 00:32:29.130
shrunk how much
time we're spending

00:32:29.130 --> 00:32:31.840
on television or in the
newspaper international news.

00:32:31.840 --> 00:32:33.460
Let's go after the digital.

00:32:33.460 --> 00:32:36.060
We will look for people who
are great bridge figure.

00:32:36.060 --> 00:32:38.620
These are people who are
within these countries

00:32:38.620 --> 00:32:40.200
but also speak English.

00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:43.330
They can help you figure out
what's actually going on,

00:32:43.330 --> 00:32:45.820
what might you want
to pay attention to.

00:32:45.820 --> 00:32:48.830
And while I think the model
is really good, what we never

00:32:48.830 --> 00:32:51.340
thought about was demand.

00:32:51.340 --> 00:32:54.940
And we've never managed to get
this product more than about

00:32:54.940 --> 00:32:56.192
a million people a month.

00:32:56.192 --> 00:32:58.150
There's about a million
people who are actually

00:32:58.150 --> 00:32:59.140
quite passionate about it.

00:32:59.140 --> 00:33:00.431
They spend a lot of time on it.

00:33:00.431 --> 00:33:01.930
They're really excited about it.

00:33:01.930 --> 00:33:04.780
But most people
either don't agree

00:33:04.780 --> 00:33:06.870
or haven't gotten
the message that you

00:33:06.870 --> 00:33:10.666
would want to think about how
you get more diversity of what

00:33:10.666 --> 00:33:11.790
you're paying attention to.

00:33:11.790 --> 00:33:16.210
And so I've started working on
a very different paradigm, which

00:33:16.210 --> 00:33:17.590
is the Fitbit paradigm.

00:33:17.590 --> 00:33:21.350
So I would like to be a smaller,
less substantial person.

00:33:21.350 --> 00:33:22.960
For a very, very
long time I have

00:33:22.960 --> 00:33:24.501
been wearing this
thing in my pocket,

00:33:24.501 --> 00:33:26.690
and it helps me
figure out whether I

00:33:26.690 --> 00:33:28.860
want to change my
behavior on any given day,

00:33:28.860 --> 00:33:30.770
get a little bit
more walking in.

00:33:30.770 --> 00:33:35.490
And what I'm finding is that
I now want a Fitbit for media.

00:33:35.490 --> 00:33:38.640
I want to find some
way to let people

00:33:38.640 --> 00:33:40.782
see what they're
paying attention to

00:33:40.782 --> 00:33:42.490
and what they're not
paying attention to.

00:33:42.490 --> 00:33:44.448
And that's what underlies
most of this research

00:33:44.448 --> 00:33:48.150
around the media cloud products,
is trying to figure out,

00:33:48.150 --> 00:33:49.850
could we make it
possible for you

00:33:49.850 --> 00:33:53.160
to monitor what you're likely to
be knowledgeable about and not

00:33:53.160 --> 00:33:55.750
knowledgeable about
based on the media

00:33:55.750 --> 00:33:57.227
that you end up consuming?

00:33:57.227 --> 00:33:59.060
And my students have
started picking this up

00:33:59.060 --> 00:34:00.210
in really interesting ways.

00:34:00.210 --> 00:34:03.120
One of my doctoral
students, Nathan Matias,

00:34:03.120 --> 00:34:05.440
makes me show this
slide using my own data,

00:34:05.440 --> 00:34:08.560
because it's a really nice
way to put me on the spot.

00:34:08.560 --> 00:34:11.370
He's written very, very
good open source tools

00:34:11.370 --> 00:34:15.710
called Open Gender Tracker
that make educated guesses

00:34:15.710 --> 00:34:19.070
at the gender of someone
that you're reading.

00:34:19.070 --> 00:34:20.880
And looking at who
I follow on Twitter,

00:34:20.880 --> 00:34:23.512
I follow a lot more
men than women.

00:34:23.512 --> 00:34:25.970
And this turned out to be the
case for almost everybody who

00:34:25.970 --> 00:34:26.970
has ended up using this.

00:34:26.970 --> 00:34:29.989
I've actually found many of the
women in my professional circle

00:34:29.989 --> 00:34:30.989
will check two accounts.

00:34:30.989 --> 00:34:32.490
They'll have a
professional account,

00:34:32.490 --> 00:34:34.614
where they're following
twice as many men as women.

00:34:34.614 --> 00:34:37.350
They'll have a personal account,
which is much closer to 50/50

00:34:37.350 --> 00:34:38.570
or further along.

00:34:38.570 --> 00:34:41.460
But the whole idea is when
you can make this visible,

00:34:41.460 --> 00:34:43.620
you can start making
conscious choices on this.

00:34:43.620 --> 00:34:48.750
I am a lot less likely to follow
some random dude on Twitter

00:34:48.750 --> 00:34:50.639
than I am to follow an
interesting moment who

00:34:50.639 --> 00:34:52.490
comes into my stream
because I have

00:34:52.490 --> 00:34:54.489
to show this slide every
time I talk about this,

00:34:54.489 --> 00:34:57.096
and I'm embarrassed by it
every single time I do it.

00:34:57.096 --> 00:34:58.470
I have another
student who's been

00:34:58.470 --> 00:35:01.800
doing wonderful work
trying to figure out

00:35:01.800 --> 00:35:06.220
whether we can use the web and
some element of self-monitoring

00:35:06.220 --> 00:35:10.410
to try to bring some serendipity
into what you encounter online.

00:35:10.410 --> 00:35:14.370
And so she's built a tool that
looks at what news you read,

00:35:14.370 --> 00:35:17.300
figures out what parts of the
world you're reading about,

00:35:17.300 --> 00:35:20.110
and then when you open a new
browser tab simply sends you

00:35:20.110 --> 00:35:22.530
to a different city,
gives you the city map,

00:35:22.530 --> 00:35:25.600
gives you reading
suggestions, tries to push you

00:35:25.600 --> 00:35:29.480
in a direction of reading
about something unfamiliar.

00:35:29.480 --> 00:35:31.730
What I'm feeling really
good about in this

00:35:31.730 --> 00:35:34.766
is that I'm not
alone on this one.

00:35:34.766 --> 00:35:36.640
Of the things that's
been very interesting is

00:35:36.640 --> 00:35:40.790
to see Sir Tim Berners-Lee,
25 years into the web,

00:35:40.790 --> 00:35:45.890
standing up and saying, I'm not
sure we got the web we want.

00:35:45.890 --> 00:35:49.320
I'm not sure that the web that
we got, in Sir Tim's case,

00:35:49.320 --> 00:35:53.310
is a global enough, is open
enough, is free enough.

00:35:53.310 --> 00:35:55.730
And he's now trying
to get people together

00:35:55.730 --> 00:36:01.060
to look at this question-- do
we have to be stuck with the web

00:36:01.060 --> 00:36:02.010
that we have?

00:36:02.010 --> 00:36:05.800
And I think this mission, this
vision of essentially saying,

00:36:05.800 --> 00:36:08.340
we could fix what
we have, we could

00:36:08.340 --> 00:36:11.740
make something very different--
if you share my sentiment

00:36:11.740 --> 00:36:13.340
that it's important
to have a more

00:36:13.340 --> 00:36:15.980
global view of the world coming
out of it, people in this room

00:36:15.980 --> 00:36:18.650
are actually in a
remarkably good place

00:36:18.650 --> 00:36:22.350
to think about how you would
actually go ahead and rewire

00:36:22.350 --> 00:36:25.529
and try to think about how you
would put together a web that

00:36:25.529 --> 00:36:27.820
was better at making us
globally knowledgeable and more

00:36:27.820 --> 00:36:29.090
cosmopolitan.

00:36:29.090 --> 00:36:30.340
So that's what I'm working on.

00:36:30.340 --> 00:36:32.173
That's what I'm thinking
about in this book.

00:36:32.173 --> 00:36:33.560
The book is now
out in paperback.

00:36:33.560 --> 00:36:36.134
So if you had been
restricted by thinking about

00:36:36.134 --> 00:36:37.800
whether my ideas were
interesting enough

00:36:37.800 --> 00:36:40.810
to carry 1 and 1/2
pounds of them around,

00:36:40.810 --> 00:36:43.020
it's now down to
about half a pound.

00:36:43.020 --> 00:36:44.890
So if I've hit the
half-pound threshold,

00:36:44.890 --> 00:36:46.640
you should definitely
go get a copy of it.

00:36:46.640 --> 00:36:48.223
But I really appreciate
you listening.

00:36:48.223 --> 00:36:50.421
I'm happy to take some
questions if anyone has any.

00:36:50.421 --> 00:36:53.070
[APPLAUSE]

00:36:53.070 --> 00:36:55.510
Please.

00:36:55.510 --> 00:36:57.510
AUDIENCE: The first thing
is the guy at Raytheon

00:36:57.510 --> 00:37:00.134
who found that the bridge people
are more creative-- has anyone

00:37:00.134 --> 00:37:03.320
replicated that looking for
the direction of causality?

00:37:03.320 --> 00:37:07.120
Because my suspicion is
that many of the people who

00:37:07.120 --> 00:37:09.250
gravitate to those roles
have a certain kind

00:37:09.250 --> 00:37:11.127
of way of thinking.

00:37:11.127 --> 00:37:12.210
ETHAN ZUCKERMAN: Yup, yup.

00:37:12.210 --> 00:37:13.709
AUDIENCE: And then
the other one is,

00:37:13.709 --> 00:37:15.750
you seem to focus a lot
on geographic diversity.

00:37:15.750 --> 00:37:17.460
ETHAN ZUCKERMAN:
Yeah, absolutely.

00:37:17.460 --> 00:37:19.590
AUDIENCE: I mean,
is that just a limit

00:37:19.590 --> 00:37:22.050
you have because of how you
think about the problem?

00:37:22.050 --> 00:37:23.480
And do you know
anyone else who's

00:37:23.480 --> 00:37:26.860
thinking of it as non-geographic
in terms of diversity.

00:37:26.860 --> 00:37:29.106
I mean, you did the
gender on Twitter.

00:37:29.106 --> 00:37:29.572
ETHAN ZUCKERMAN:
Yeah, yeah. yeah.

00:37:29.572 --> 00:37:30.040
Yeah.

00:37:30.040 --> 00:37:30.623
No, thank you.

00:37:30.623 --> 00:37:33.100
That's an awesome
pair of questions.

00:37:33.100 --> 00:37:36.300
So the Rob Burt work has been
looked at very, very closely.

00:37:36.300 --> 00:37:39.730
That's a paper with
like 5,000 cites to it.

00:37:39.730 --> 00:37:42.860
What most people have
looked at is actually

00:37:42.860 --> 00:37:48.260
Raytheon's total inability to
use the suggestions he made.

00:37:48.260 --> 00:37:50.350
So essentially having
identified the smart people

00:37:50.350 --> 00:37:52.580
in the company, why
has Raytheon continued

00:37:52.580 --> 00:37:54.701
to be such a disaster?

00:37:54.701 --> 00:37:56.200
I don't know
specifically of someone

00:37:56.200 --> 00:37:57.910
who's verified your
hypotheses, but I

00:37:57.910 --> 00:38:00.220
think it's really
nice, which is,

00:38:00.220 --> 00:38:03.580
you may have certain people
gravitating to that place.

00:38:03.580 --> 00:38:07.270
In the book, I use Burt to talk
about this idea of a bridge

00:38:07.270 --> 00:38:07.900
figure.

00:38:07.900 --> 00:38:09.483
And for me, a bridge
figure is someone

00:38:09.483 --> 00:38:11.850
who's sort of straddling
two different worlds.

00:38:11.850 --> 00:38:13.625
And it's not just that
you're bicultural.

00:38:13.625 --> 00:38:15.000
There are a lot
of people who are

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:17.900
bicultural who choose
not to be a bridge.

00:38:17.900 --> 00:38:21.022
They're not actually interested
in brokering between the two.

00:38:21.022 --> 00:38:22.980
I think there probably
is a bridge personality.

00:38:22.980 --> 00:38:24.880
I wouldn't be surprised
at all to find

00:38:24.880 --> 00:38:27.720
that bridge personalities
gravitate there.

00:38:27.720 --> 00:38:30.750
You're totally right on
the extent to which I'm

00:38:30.750 --> 00:38:34.702
using geography as an
imperfect proxy for diversity.

00:38:34.702 --> 00:38:37.160
And what I end up talking about
in the book is I go further

00:38:37.160 --> 00:38:39.310
with it, is essentially saying,
what I'm really interested in

00:38:39.310 --> 00:38:40.320
is cognitive diversity.

00:38:40.320 --> 00:38:42.550
I'm really interested
in this question of,

00:38:42.550 --> 00:38:45.070
do you look at the world
in a different way?

00:38:45.070 --> 00:38:49.100
By spending a pretty substantial
chunk of my adult life in West

00:38:49.100 --> 00:38:50.860
Africa, I can
definitely tell you

00:38:50.860 --> 00:38:52.540
that the average
West African has

00:38:52.540 --> 00:38:55.270
a really different and
sometimes more hopeful

00:38:55.270 --> 00:38:57.937
set of cognitive tools to
take on different problems.

00:38:57.937 --> 00:38:59.770
And it has to do with
an educational system.

00:38:59.770 --> 00:39:01.970
And it has to do with the
society that you live in.

00:39:01.970 --> 00:39:05.390
But there's no guarantee that
that geographic difference

00:39:05.390 --> 00:39:07.560
is going to turn into
a cognitive difference.

00:39:07.560 --> 00:39:11.330
You can imagine taking a
friend of mine out of a West

00:39:11.330 --> 00:39:13.040
African primary
school, educating them

00:39:13.040 --> 00:39:15.540
in the same schools that I've
been in, working the same jobs

00:39:15.540 --> 00:39:17.930
that I do, we're going to
end up thinking a lot alike

00:39:17.930 --> 00:39:19.980
in many ways.

00:39:19.980 --> 00:39:22.830
There are definitely
people looking

00:39:22.830 --> 00:39:25.880
at questions around
gender diversity,

00:39:25.880 --> 00:39:28.024
around racial and
ethnic diversity.

00:39:28.024 --> 00:39:30.190
Over in our lab, the student
of mine, Nathan Matias,

00:39:30.190 --> 00:39:34.670
has been doing really
good, deep work

00:39:34.670 --> 00:39:37.800
on gender diversity and
representation in media.

00:39:37.800 --> 00:39:40.170
And there's actually a
very helpful community

00:39:40.170 --> 00:39:44.750
around there trying to
get a sense for why is it

00:39:44.750 --> 00:39:49.350
that it's only 16% of op
eds are written by women?

00:39:49.350 --> 00:39:52.540
And is this a place where
you could sort of put a lever

00:39:52.540 --> 00:39:54.500
and try to get not
only gender diversity

00:39:54.500 --> 00:39:57.754
but cognitive diversity
in the process?

00:39:57.754 --> 00:39:58.420
Other questions?

00:40:01.510 --> 00:40:04.020
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I have
a question about-- I

00:40:04.020 --> 00:40:06.980
like your comments about
connectedness in the world,

00:40:06.980 --> 00:40:07.650
right?

00:40:07.650 --> 00:40:10.370
And to some degree,
I think you expressed

00:40:10.370 --> 00:40:13.540
maybe some disappointment
about how even

00:40:13.540 --> 00:40:15.550
the connections that
there are internationally,

00:40:15.550 --> 00:40:18.020
that they are sort of obvious
to some degree, right?

00:40:18.020 --> 00:40:21.260
Me as a German, I might be more
connected to other Germans,

00:40:21.260 --> 00:40:23.890
so these connections are worth
less to some degree, right?

00:40:27.294 --> 00:40:29.710
I wonder if we have enough
tools for these kind of things.

00:40:29.710 --> 00:40:32.272
Like I mean, you mentioned like
the cafeteria model, right?

00:40:32.272 --> 00:40:33.730
You go into a
cafeteria and you sit

00:40:33.730 --> 00:40:38.460
next to people that are
similar to yourself, right?

00:40:38.460 --> 00:40:40.860
And I think in social
networks, it always

00:40:40.860 --> 00:40:43.190
tends to be that all the
new connection you make

00:40:43.190 --> 00:40:45.677
are obvious given the kind
of things you do, right?

00:40:45.677 --> 00:40:47.260
You travel to a
remote office and then

00:40:47.260 --> 00:40:49.593
maybe you get connected to
people in that remote office,

00:40:49.593 --> 00:40:50.580
right?

00:40:50.580 --> 00:40:52.160
Do you know if
there's any good tools

00:40:52.160 --> 00:40:54.810
to get randomly
connected, like sort

00:40:54.810 --> 00:40:57.200
of like a sort of
virtual cocktail hours,

00:40:57.200 --> 00:40:59.860
where you just socialize with
completely random people that

00:40:59.860 --> 00:41:02.280
also are interested
in socializing

00:41:02.280 --> 00:41:03.892
with other completely
random people?

00:41:03.892 --> 00:41:06.350
ETHAN ZUCKERMAN: So there's
two approaches to this problem.

00:41:06.350 --> 00:41:10.740
There are people who've
done pure randomness.

00:41:10.740 --> 00:41:14.336
And pure randomness doesn't
work necessarily all that well.

00:41:14.336 --> 00:41:15.710
To a certain
extent, Chatroulette

00:41:15.710 --> 00:41:17.870
is pure randomness, right?

00:41:17.870 --> 00:41:19.560
That was kind of the
theory behind it.

00:41:19.560 --> 00:41:21.530
Let's just open a chat
window, someone else

00:41:21.530 --> 00:41:22.740
arbitrarily in the room.

00:41:22.740 --> 00:41:24.770
The emergence of
the social norms of,

00:41:24.770 --> 00:41:28.500
and now let me show you my
genitals, was sort of emergent

00:41:28.500 --> 00:41:29.560
on top of that platform.

00:41:29.560 --> 00:41:31.851
But that may simply
be where you end up

00:41:31.851 --> 00:41:33.850
when you're dealing with
sort of pure randomness

00:41:33.850 --> 00:41:36.109
and pure anonymity.

00:41:36.109 --> 00:41:37.650
And there are people
playing with it.

00:41:37.650 --> 00:41:40.050
And then there are
services like StumbleUpon

00:41:40.050 --> 00:41:44.640
that are sort of trying
almost pure random.

00:41:44.640 --> 00:41:47.700
There's an app called
Random that works on this.

00:41:47.700 --> 00:41:50.230
The ones that I'm actually
much more interested in

00:41:50.230 --> 00:41:52.660
are trying to
engineer serendipity.

00:41:52.660 --> 00:41:55.970
And they're looking
for a connection

00:41:55.970 --> 00:41:59.530
where some aspect of it
is something in common,

00:41:59.530 --> 00:42:02.600
and some aspect of it
is something unexpected.

00:42:02.600 --> 00:42:05.780
So two really quick
models on this.

00:42:05.780 --> 00:42:10.320
Like a lot of people, like a lot
of geeks my age, I miss Usenet.

00:42:10.320 --> 00:42:13.420
And I miss sort of
the early '90s Usenet.

00:42:13.420 --> 00:42:16.250
And what I specifically miss
about the early '90s Usenet

00:42:16.250 --> 00:42:19.610
was that it was a
topic-organized internet.

00:42:19.610 --> 00:42:23.364
So if I found
myself on rec.photo,

00:42:23.364 --> 00:42:24.780
there was a good
chance that I was

00:42:24.780 --> 00:42:27.530
going to run into someone from
Japan or someone from Finland,

00:42:27.530 --> 00:42:30.990
but we were going to have
enough in common round emergent

00:42:30.990 --> 00:42:33.510
digital photography that
we would have a reason

00:42:33.510 --> 00:42:34.950
to have a conversation.

00:42:34.950 --> 00:42:38.261
And then we might have more
of that geographic diversity,

00:42:38.261 --> 00:42:40.510
maybe more of the gender
diversity, more of the income

00:42:40.510 --> 00:42:44.660
diversity coming from
having that topic in common.

00:42:44.660 --> 00:42:46.550
Where I'm now sort of
thinking about this

00:42:46.550 --> 00:42:49.180
is I actually think
Twitter is potentially

00:42:49.180 --> 00:42:50.690
a very interesting
tool for this.

00:42:50.690 --> 00:42:52.660
Because the connection
is pretty lightweight.

00:42:52.660 --> 00:42:54.650
You're sort of
sharing information.

00:42:54.650 --> 00:42:57.233
And so part of what I'm trying
to do-- one of the things we're

00:42:57.233 --> 00:42:58.730
playing around
with right now is,

00:42:58.730 --> 00:43:02.400
can I try to figure out what
your community of interests

00:43:02.400 --> 00:43:03.860
looks like on Twitter?

00:43:03.860 --> 00:43:07.630
And can I find a community that
is related but sufficiently

00:43:07.630 --> 00:43:08.510
different?

00:43:08.510 --> 00:43:10.870
So if I'm a social media
guru or whatever the hell

00:43:10.870 --> 00:43:15.330
that means in the US, can I
find that person in Nigeria?

00:43:15.330 --> 00:43:18.140
And in having that
element of difference

00:43:18.140 --> 00:43:20.170
as well as that
element of similarity,

00:43:20.170 --> 00:43:22.310
can there be enough that
we're likely to have

00:43:22.310 --> 00:43:24.032
that really
profitable connection,

00:43:24.032 --> 00:43:25.990
but enough difference
that we're likely to have

00:43:25.990 --> 00:43:27.180
something else of it?

00:43:27.180 --> 00:43:29.870
It's a really hard problem.

00:43:29.870 --> 00:43:32.380
And in doing sort of reading
recommendation around it,

00:43:32.380 --> 00:43:34.004
which is what Catherine
D'Ignazio and I

00:43:34.004 --> 00:43:37.670
spent a lot of time doing on
that Terra Incognita problem.

00:43:37.670 --> 00:43:42.090
We actually figured out that
it's probably not as simple as

00:43:42.090 --> 00:43:44.060
hi, have a chat.

00:43:44.060 --> 00:43:47.300
It's probably more like, can
I give you enough information

00:43:47.300 --> 00:43:50.290
that you would have something
to have a chat about?

00:43:50.290 --> 00:43:52.020
And so the model
that I'm in some ways

00:43:52.020 --> 00:43:55.100
really interested in is one
that started in Scandinavia,

00:43:55.100 --> 00:43:57.430
is now sort of playing out
in public libraries, which

00:43:57.430 --> 00:44:02.460
is the human library, which is
you identify a set of people

00:44:02.460 --> 00:44:03.970
from very different
walks of life,

00:44:03.970 --> 00:44:05.407
very different backgrounds.

00:44:05.407 --> 00:44:07.490
You put them in the library,
and you offer someone

00:44:07.490 --> 00:44:09.820
the opportunity to
go check out a person

00:44:09.820 --> 00:44:11.210
and sort of have a conversation.

00:44:11.210 --> 00:44:14.160
And whenever this has
been done at libraries,

00:44:14.160 --> 00:44:16.246
it sort of sells out
almost immediately.

00:44:16.246 --> 00:44:17.870
My wife and I were
sort of arguing over

00:44:17.870 --> 00:44:20.315
who got to do it at Williams
College in Williamstown,

00:44:20.315 --> 00:44:24.120
and we figured that random
professorial type was not

00:44:24.120 --> 00:44:26.330
as appealing as rabbi,
which was her identity.

00:44:26.330 --> 00:44:29.620
And so she signed up as
a rabbi and had like 9

00:44:29.620 --> 00:44:31.670
of her 10 slots filled
almost immediately.

00:44:31.670 --> 00:44:35.020
The one guy who was more
popular out in deep blue Western

00:44:35.020 --> 00:44:37.680
Massachusetts was Gun Owner.

00:44:37.680 --> 00:44:39.990
And everyone wanted to
go talk to this guy.

00:44:39.990 --> 00:44:42.480
And I'm now actually taking
shooting lessons from the guy.

00:44:42.480 --> 00:44:44.890
So there are really
interesting things

00:44:44.890 --> 00:44:48.040
that sort of happen when
you set up structures

00:44:48.040 --> 00:44:49.375
to allow people to meet.

00:44:49.375 --> 00:44:50.250
But I agree with you.

00:44:50.250 --> 00:44:51.390
I think in many
cases, it's something

00:44:51.390 --> 00:44:53.140
where we would want
to do a lot more work.

00:44:53.140 --> 00:44:54.190
Please.

00:44:54.190 --> 00:44:58.510
AUDIENCE: This is sort
of a modeled question,

00:44:58.510 --> 00:45:02.800
but I think-- well, my
viewpoint anyway-- we

00:45:02.800 --> 00:45:06.730
have a bit of a problem with
this partisan echo chamber.

00:45:06.730 --> 00:45:09.840
You can select news
sources that are never

00:45:09.840 --> 00:45:15.790
going to deliver you information
that challenges your worldview.

00:45:15.790 --> 00:45:20.970
But if I go look for
information sources

00:45:20.970 --> 00:45:27.360
that are not from my
partisan perspective,

00:45:27.360 --> 00:45:29.270
I wind up reading op
eds that sort of make

00:45:29.270 --> 00:45:32.110
me want to throw a brick
through my computer screen.

00:45:32.110 --> 00:45:35.950
And I don't know-- do you have
any thoughts on if there's

00:45:35.950 --> 00:45:43.870
a way out of this trap of
you want information that

00:45:43.870 --> 00:45:48.470
challenges you, but you don't
want information or opinion,

00:45:48.470 --> 00:45:51.184
maybe, that is repugnant.

00:45:51.184 --> 00:45:53.100
ETHAN ZUCKERMAN: I think
that's exactly right,

00:45:53.100 --> 00:45:55.090
and by the way, not
a muddled question,

00:45:55.090 --> 00:45:59.500
a nicely put question and right
at the heart of some really

00:45:59.500 --> 00:46:01.600
interesting debates
going on in the space.

00:46:01.600 --> 00:46:04.830
There's a huge
debate going on about

00:46:04.830 --> 00:46:09.530
whether the internet is
separating us politically.

00:46:09.530 --> 00:46:11.950
And I would say on one side,
probably the best articulated

00:46:11.950 --> 00:46:15.130
is a guy named Cass
Sunstein, who has said,

00:46:15.130 --> 00:46:18.640
I've done experiments
in deliberation.

00:46:18.640 --> 00:46:21.300
You put people in the room
with like-minded people,

00:46:21.300 --> 00:46:22.820
people get more extreme.

00:46:22.820 --> 00:46:25.280
If I hang out with the far
left, I get further left.

00:46:25.280 --> 00:46:28.850
You hang out with the far
right, you get further right.

00:46:28.850 --> 00:46:32.805
Gentzkow and Shapiro, really
pair of economists at Chicago,

00:46:32.805 --> 00:46:34.180
wrote a paper
essentially saying,

00:46:34.180 --> 00:46:36.000
no, no, no, the
internet's actually

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:39.330
much better than the
rest of the media.

00:46:39.330 --> 00:46:41.810
You're actually going to
get more diverse audiences.

00:46:41.810 --> 00:46:43.440
It's a really
controversial paper.

00:46:43.440 --> 00:46:45.950
I take it on at some
length in the book

00:46:45.950 --> 00:46:48.350
and come to a different
conclusion than they come to.

00:46:48.350 --> 00:46:50.070
But they're better
economists than I am,

00:46:50.070 --> 00:46:51.320
so they may be right.

00:46:51.320 --> 00:46:52.620
I may be wrong.

00:46:52.620 --> 00:46:56.070
My take on this would
be the first instinct,

00:46:56.070 --> 00:46:59.077
which is, OK, let
me turn on Fox News,

00:46:59.077 --> 00:47:01.410
and I'm going to understand
what they're thinking about,

00:47:01.410 --> 00:47:03.600
is probably wrong.

00:47:03.600 --> 00:47:07.771
Because you're going to the
absolute opposite pole of where

00:47:07.771 --> 00:47:08.270
you are.

00:47:08.270 --> 00:47:10.160
And it's really hard
to look at this other

00:47:10.160 --> 00:47:13.630
than, that's the enemy, I want
to figure out who they are,

00:47:13.630 --> 00:47:14.955
and I want to undercut them.

00:47:14.955 --> 00:47:17.350
I actually think
the thing to do is,

00:47:17.350 --> 00:47:19.210
when you're sort of
orthogonal with someone,

00:47:19.210 --> 00:47:22.895
to try to figure out how you
get the optimum sort of angle

00:47:22.895 --> 00:47:24.580
of consonance, right?

00:47:24.580 --> 00:47:30.590
So if I'm looking for a
conservative viewpoint

00:47:30.590 --> 00:47:33.310
that I might want to
pay real attention to,

00:47:33.310 --> 00:47:35.960
I'm not going to
look for someone

00:47:35.960 --> 00:47:38.560
who's contemptuous of
science and someone who's

00:47:38.560 --> 00:47:41.440
deeply religious and someone
who's from the American South.

00:47:41.440 --> 00:47:43.850
What I might end
up looking for is

00:47:43.850 --> 00:47:47.180
someone who is also from New
England, also in academia,

00:47:47.180 --> 00:47:51.220
but happens to think really
different things than I do.

00:47:51.220 --> 00:47:53.260
And when I'm able to
find those people,

00:47:53.260 --> 00:47:55.960
I find myself much
more challenged.

00:47:55.960 --> 00:47:58.380
And so that may only be a
15 degrees of difference

00:47:58.380 --> 00:48:00.335
rather than 180
degrees of difference,

00:48:00.335 --> 00:48:01.710
but that 15 degrees
of difference

00:48:01.710 --> 00:48:03.251
puts me in a place
where I'm actually

00:48:03.251 --> 00:48:06.660
forced to deal with the argument
and sort of read it through.

00:48:06.660 --> 00:48:08.520
And so what I'm
interested in is,

00:48:08.520 --> 00:48:12.000
can we start identifying those
people 15 to 30 degrees off

00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:14.841
of where we are, and then
find out what they read,

00:48:14.841 --> 00:48:16.590
and find out how we
meet them, and sort of

00:48:16.590 --> 00:48:19.100
find out how we sort of
have those conversations?

00:48:19.100 --> 00:48:21.350
These are the sorts of
systems that I would really

00:48:21.350 --> 00:48:23.722
like to be building.

00:48:23.722 --> 00:48:25.930
But I've only got sort of
three or four grad students

00:48:25.930 --> 00:48:26.600
over there.

00:48:26.600 --> 00:48:29.802
And this is a big company.

00:48:29.802 --> 00:48:31.510
You guys build a lot
of different things.

00:48:31.510 --> 00:48:34.620
I'm really interested in,
can I get other people

00:48:34.620 --> 00:48:37.460
in the tech industry who
are interested in exactly

00:48:37.460 --> 00:48:40.770
that question that you're
asking to sort of say,

00:48:40.770 --> 00:48:43.900
is this perhaps part
of our responsibility?

00:48:43.900 --> 00:48:45.610
Is this part of
what we should be

00:48:45.610 --> 00:48:50.180
asking our tools to do, is
not just give us what we want,

00:48:50.180 --> 00:48:54.110
but possibly giving us
what we need in civic terms

00:48:54.110 --> 00:48:57.490
to try to get to a more
inclusive society in one

00:48:57.490 --> 00:49:00.160
fashion or another?

00:49:00.160 --> 00:49:02.350
Anybody else?

00:49:02.350 --> 00:49:03.250
Hey.

00:49:03.250 --> 00:49:04.120
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:49:04.120 --> 00:49:07.320
So people listening to this
talk who may be very interested,

00:49:07.320 --> 00:49:09.270
but they're working
on another project,

00:49:09.270 --> 00:49:12.490
and a few months pass,
and they forget about it--

00:49:12.490 --> 00:49:16.650
how can we foster a more
frequent contact so that this

00:49:16.650 --> 00:49:17.900
stays on people's minds?

00:49:17.900 --> 00:49:19.850
ETHAN ZUCKERMAN: Well,
I am across the street.

00:49:19.850 --> 00:49:20.870
And you can come see us.

00:49:20.870 --> 00:49:22.150
And you can actually
get into to my building

00:49:22.150 --> 00:49:23.680
without ID, which
is always nice.

00:49:23.680 --> 00:49:30.220
But so a couple things--
I sort of soft-pedaled

00:49:30.220 --> 00:49:31.730
the Global Voices project.

00:49:31.730 --> 00:49:36.500
But there's actually a very
vibrant community of people

00:49:36.500 --> 00:49:38.800
around that really working
on this question of,

00:49:38.800 --> 00:49:40.675
how would you pay more
attention to the world

00:49:40.675 --> 00:49:43.240
and sort of how would you
fight the way in which

00:49:43.240 --> 00:49:45.330
those countries are
framed and understood?

00:49:45.330 --> 00:49:47.330
And so one of the things
that I would definitely

00:49:47.330 --> 00:49:49.990
encourage people to
do is to think about,

00:49:49.990 --> 00:49:52.790
is that something
to connect with?

00:49:52.790 --> 00:49:55.230
We are doing some
active experiments

00:49:55.230 --> 00:49:57.150
on trying to figure
out both, can we

00:49:57.150 --> 00:50:01.830
monitor media consumption
voluntarily, sort of opt in?

00:50:01.830 --> 00:50:04.470
And when we learn that
media consumption has

00:50:04.470 --> 00:50:05.960
certain biases
associated with it,

00:50:05.960 --> 00:50:09.160
can we do structured
recommendations of content?

00:50:09.160 --> 00:50:12.560
And for me, that strikes me
as a very interesting place--

00:50:12.560 --> 00:50:13.670
potential to collaborate.

00:50:13.670 --> 00:50:15.800
And we do have students sort
of working on that and sort

00:50:15.800 --> 00:50:17.216
of playing with
that, and you guys

00:50:17.216 --> 00:50:19.667
would be very welcome to
come across the street

00:50:19.667 --> 00:50:21.625
to the Media Lab, have
conversations about that

00:50:21.625 --> 00:50:24.780
and sort of figure
out where to go.

00:50:24.780 --> 00:50:27.150
The trick in sort
of writing a book

00:50:27.150 --> 00:50:31.240
is you're trying
to identify people

00:50:31.240 --> 00:50:33.090
who think a problem
is important enough

00:50:33.090 --> 00:50:35.660
that they want to put
some time into it.

00:50:35.660 --> 00:50:40.630
And so this is sort
of my plea to people

00:50:40.630 --> 00:50:42.130
who think this is
interesting enough

00:50:42.130 --> 00:50:44.900
that they want to work on it.

00:50:44.900 --> 00:50:48.050
And I'm now sort of advising
half a dozen projects

00:50:48.050 --> 00:50:50.830
around the world
of people who think

00:50:50.830 --> 00:50:53.437
this is an interesting
thing to explore and want

00:50:53.437 --> 00:50:54.395
to work together on it.

00:50:54.395 --> 00:50:56.100
I would love to be
involved with sort

00:50:56.100 --> 00:50:57.469
of more of those conversations.

00:50:57.469 --> 00:51:00.010
I would also love to be involved
in conversations with people

00:51:00.010 --> 00:51:01.670
who I've got it
wrong and I'm not

00:51:01.670 --> 00:51:03.910
framing the question
the right way

00:51:03.910 --> 00:51:05.570
or the most provocative way.

00:51:05.570 --> 00:51:08.650
But I would hope to
sort of open a door

00:51:08.650 --> 00:51:12.390
around this, either to that
existing, thriving community

00:51:12.390 --> 00:51:15.017
around Global Voices or
to the nascent community

00:51:15.017 --> 00:51:17.100
around civic media that
we have across the street.

00:51:21.970 --> 00:51:22.470
Please.

00:51:22.470 --> 00:51:23.844
AUDIENCE: I think
also that might

00:51:23.844 --> 00:51:25.770
be a good opportunity
for the plug.

00:51:25.770 --> 00:51:29.130
If anybody here is interested
in sort of topics like citizen

00:51:29.130 --> 00:51:31.770
journalism and stuff like
that, we have a team here

00:51:31.770 --> 00:51:34.250
in Cambridge working on
YouTube live streaming,

00:51:34.250 --> 00:51:36.310
where we sort of
worry a lot about news

00:51:36.310 --> 00:51:40.250
and how live streaming of
news sort of can impact

00:51:40.250 --> 00:51:43.107
these kind of questions around
news and citizen journalism

00:51:43.107 --> 00:51:43.940
and stuff like that.

00:51:43.940 --> 00:51:46.660
And we're now starting work
with MIT Media Lab, actually.

00:51:46.660 --> 00:51:49.309
YouTube is funding research
at the MIT Media Lab

00:51:49.309 --> 00:51:50.600
to sort of explore these ideas.

00:51:50.600 --> 00:51:51.975
So we've been
actually in contact

00:51:51.975 --> 00:51:54.410
with Ethan, people who
are interested to work

00:51:54.410 --> 00:51:55.150
on these things.

00:51:55.150 --> 00:51:56.900
ETHAN ZUCKERMAN: And
precisely the project

00:51:56.900 --> 00:51:58.060
we're talking about
working on together

00:51:58.060 --> 00:51:59.960
is trying to figure
out, how do you put

00:51:59.960 --> 00:52:03.550
enough context around the
live stream of an event

00:52:03.550 --> 00:52:06.330
that it's comprehensible to
someone who doesn't know where

00:52:06.330 --> 00:52:08.150
it's coming from?

00:52:08.150 --> 00:52:09.780
I was looking at
this the other day,

00:52:09.780 --> 00:52:13.920
and the protests about the
internet tax in Hungary

00:52:13.920 --> 00:52:15.597
were being live-streamed
on YouTube.

00:52:15.597 --> 00:52:17.680
And on the one hand, this
was sort of fascinating.

00:52:17.680 --> 00:52:20.660
It's really interesting
to see tens of thousands

00:52:20.660 --> 00:52:23.930
of Hungarians come out into the
street over an internet access

00:52:23.930 --> 00:52:24.820
issue.

00:52:24.820 --> 00:52:28.080
The flip side is that my
Hungarian is not very good,

00:52:28.080 --> 00:52:30.970
and there's no
information or sort

00:52:30.970 --> 00:52:32.750
of context going on on that.

00:52:32.750 --> 00:52:34.700
How do we turn that
amazing ability

00:52:34.700 --> 00:52:37.790
we have to now be in
the streets of Budapest

00:52:37.790 --> 00:52:39.224
watching that protest unfold?

00:52:39.224 --> 00:52:40.890
How does that turn
into that opportunity

00:52:40.890 --> 00:52:42.480
to actually get informed on it?

00:52:42.480 --> 00:52:46.250
So we're excited to work
with you guys on that.

00:52:46.250 --> 00:52:47.440
Thank you so much, guys.

00:52:47.440 --> 00:52:48.750
Please help yourself to a book.

00:52:48.750 --> 00:52:51.440
I'm happy to sign one
if anyone is interested.

00:52:51.440 --> 00:52:54.120
I'm happy to sign more than
one if anyone is interested.

00:52:54.120 --> 00:52:55.850
It's been really
great to be here.

00:52:55.850 --> 00:52:59.200
