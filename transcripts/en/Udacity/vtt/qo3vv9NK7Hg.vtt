00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:04.370
So we talked about organizations
as part of their security planning

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:06.670
need to have a security policy.

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:09.060
While Georgia Tech has a computer and

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:12.200
network use policy,
we talked about do's and don'ts.

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.120
What is okay to do, and
what you should not do.

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.610
So let's quickly sort
of look at some things

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:21.650
that are there in the Georgia Tech
computer and network use policy.

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:26.043
It does articulate, it does talk about
what some of the guiding principles are.

00:00:26.043 --> 00:00:29.209
Why does the policy
look the way it does?

00:00:29.209 --> 00:00:34.053
First of all, we want the policy guiding
principle is that we want in order to

00:00:34.053 --> 00:00:37.765
protect important IT resources
that Georgia Tech has.

00:00:37.765 --> 00:00:41.935
So when you protect, you're
talking about protecting the data,

00:00:41.935 --> 00:00:46.810
the services, and things like that
which are enabled by those resources.

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:51.440
Another guiding principle is that we
don't let anything illegal happen that

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.940
involves our computer systems,
our IT systems.

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:59.730
So these are the guiding principles,
but you should read the policy.

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.673
And here, we're just going to talk about
sort of couple of quick highlights,

00:01:04.673 --> 00:01:09.000
things that you might think jump out and
say, why do we have this?

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.460
So it talks about copyright and
intellectual property, actually.

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:13.930
So why is it talking about?

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:15.590
Of course, as a research university,

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:17.840
Georgia Tech creates
intellectual property and so

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.910
on, and that intellectual property
resides on our computers.

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:23.806
But at the same time, state campuses,

00:01:23.806 --> 00:01:27.510
they used to have a problem where
people would download music.

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:29.834
In particular,
they will download illegal music, and

00:01:29.834 --> 00:01:32.400
universities got into
trouble because of that.

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.350
So we're obviously addressing
that explicitly in the policy.

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.340
Remember, the policy is about dos and
don'ts, and if it is copyrighted

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.760
material or there's intellectual
property, how that should be handled.

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:46.810
Of course, it talks about that.

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:49.460
Interestingly, it also talks
about export controls.

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:54.090
While universities have people
from all over the world, and

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.680
people work with counterparts in
other countries and things like that,

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.870
when there's exchange of things across
national boundaries, of course,

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:05.470
export control becomes an issue.

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:10.820
And that's why it's interesting that
it sort makes its way into this policy.

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:13.621
But again, this is sort of
the guiding principle here,

00:02:13.621 --> 00:02:16.793
is that there are any legal
requirements we are okay with them.

00:02:16.793 --> 00:02:21.273
Georgia Tech's policy actually also,
remember one of the things we said,

00:02:21.273 --> 00:02:24.493
we have to make sure that
the people who responsible for

00:02:24.493 --> 00:02:27.376
it can be held accountable and
things like that.

00:02:27.376 --> 00:02:29.989
So it does address responsibility for

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:33.743
securing the resources or
the assets that we have, and

00:02:33.743 --> 00:02:38.001
it's kind of a distributed
responsibility at Georgia Tech.

00:02:38.001 --> 00:02:42.181
When you look at sort of the larger
network Office of Information Technology

00:02:42.181 --> 00:02:45.514
which is a central organization for
the entire university,

00:02:45.514 --> 00:02:47.920
well they're responsible for it.

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:53.860
But if you look at individual devices,
laptops, servers, or desktops, all

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:58.400
that is the responsibility of the unit
or the individual whose machine it is.

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.563
A unit for example,
School of Computer Science or

00:03:01.563 --> 00:03:05.783
the College of Computing, for
example, would be responsible for

00:03:05.783 --> 00:03:10.252
the computers that are used by
their staff, faculty, and students.

00:03:10.252 --> 00:03:14.779
But protecting the Georgia Tech
network that is the responsibility of

00:03:14.779 --> 00:03:16.168
the central office.

00:03:16.168 --> 00:03:18.455
As I said,
you should read the policy and

00:03:18.455 --> 00:03:21.290
all the different aspects
that are covered by it.
