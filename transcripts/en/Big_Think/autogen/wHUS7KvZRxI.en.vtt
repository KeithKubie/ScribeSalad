00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:42.880 align:start position:0%
but the truth is that we can't live
 

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:44.610 align:start position:0%
but the truth is that we can't live
without<00:00:43.030><c> finance</c><00:00:43.630><c> and</c><00:00:43.870><c> we</c><00:00:43.900><c> need</c><00:00:44.530><c> to</c>

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:44.620 align:start position:0%
without finance and we need to

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:46.600 align:start position:0%
rehabilitate finance and the reason we
 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.319 align:start position:0%
rehabilitate finance and the reason we
