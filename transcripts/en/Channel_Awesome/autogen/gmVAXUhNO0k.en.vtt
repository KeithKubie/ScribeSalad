in the age of I like it means you hated
 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.900
in the age of I like it means you hated
it for whatever reason but there was

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910
it for whatever reason but there was
 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.280
it for whatever reason but there was
something I realized watching this one

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290
something I realized watching this one
 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:41.510
something I realized watching this one
because one of my issues with the first

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520
because one of my issues with the first
 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.510
because one of my issues with the first
film not issue but I said if we're gonna

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520
film not issue but I said if we're gonna
 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.520
film not issue but I said if we're gonna
break the fourth wall so much when we

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530
break the fourth wall so much when we
 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.040
break the fourth wall so much when we
try to go serious like so dark and so

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050
try to go serious like so dark and so
 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.939
try to go serious like so dark and so
serious you know do the tones really mix

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949
serious you know do the tones really mix
 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.170
serious you know do the tones really mix
because then I'm always thinking like a

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180
because then I'm always thinking like a
 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.610
because then I'm always thinking like a
watch you do this fourth wall joke to

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620
watch you do this fourth wall joke to
 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.459
watch you do this fourth wall joke to
get out of that and stuff but I realized

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469
get out of that and stuff but I realized
 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.189
get out of that and stuff but I realized
that I think when you do combine the two

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199
that I think when you do combine the two
 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.250
that I think when you do combine the two
like that when you get into the really

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260
like that when you get into the really
 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.080
like that when you get into the really
serious moments are the extreme action

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090
serious moments are the extreme action
 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.580
serious moments are the extreme action
and stuff like that it makes the funnier

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590
and stuff like that it makes the funnier
 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.260
and stuff like that it makes the funnier
moments all the more funny because you

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270
moments all the more funny because you
 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.899
moments all the more funny because you
don't know when they're coming and I'm

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909
don't know when they're coming and I'm
 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.550
don't know when they're coming and I'm
thinking like the big action scene with

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560
thinking like the big action scene with
 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.200
thinking like the big action scene with
you know the trucks and everything and

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210
you know the trucks and everything and
 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.090
you know the trucks and everything and
I'm thinking that was the best thing in

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100
I'm thinking that was the best thing in
 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.630
I'm thinking that was the best thing in
the movie yes

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640
 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.490

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500
yeah it's twice that uh I mean I I guess
 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.289
yeah it's twice that uh I mean I I guess
this isn't technically MCU but it's a

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299
this isn't technically MCU but it's a
 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.719
this isn't technically MCU but it's a
Marvel property so it's twice a Marvel

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729
Marvel property so it's twice a Marvel
 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.760
Marvel property so it's twice a Marvel
property this year has been saved by a

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770
property this year has been saved by a
 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.130
property this year has been saved by a
car chase cuz Black Panther was the same

car chase cuz Black Panther was the same
 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.690
car chase cuz Black Panther was the same
thing - that was the best action

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700
thing - that was the best action
 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.490
thing - that was the best action
sequence and built in Black Panther as

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500
sequence and built in Black Panther as
 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.770
sequence and built in Black Panther as
