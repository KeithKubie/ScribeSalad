00:00:13.657 --> 00:00:15.745
How big was that fish you caught?

00:00:15.745 --> 00:00:16.832
This big?

00:00:17.107 --> 00:00:17.977
This big?

00:00:18.485 --> 00:00:20.123
This big?

00:00:20.123 --> 00:00:21.499
Without photographic evidence,

00:00:21.499 --> 00:00:23.830
there's nothing that proves you caught a whopper,

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:26.551
and that's been true since the dawn of fishing.

00:00:26.551 --> 00:00:28.782
In fact, hundreds of years ago,

00:00:28.782 --> 00:00:31.279
long before photography could capture the moment,

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:33.461
Japanese fishermen invented their own way

00:00:33.461 --> 00:00:35.428
to record trophy catches.

00:00:35.428 --> 00:00:38.149
They called it Gyotaku.

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:40.932
Gyotaku is the ancient art of printing fish

00:00:40.932 --> 00:00:42.559
that originated in Japan

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:44.312
as a way to record trophy catches

00:00:44.312 --> 00:00:46.702
prior to the modern day camera.

00:00:48.362 --> 00:00:49.959
Gyo means fish

00:00:49.959 --> 00:00:52.151
and taku means impression.

00:00:52.151 --> 00:00:54.044
There are several different stories about

00:00:54.044 --> 00:00:55.823
how Gyotaku came about,

00:00:55.823 --> 00:00:57.357
but it basically started with fishermen

00:00:57.357 --> 00:00:59.827
needing a way to record the species and size

00:00:59.827 --> 00:01:03.497
of the fish they caught over 100 years ago.

00:01:03.497 --> 00:01:05.666
Fishermen took paper, ink, and brushes

00:01:05.666 --> 00:01:07.043
out to sea with them.

00:01:07.043 --> 00:01:10.297
They told stories of great adventures at sea.

00:01:10.297 --> 00:01:12.464
Since the Japanese revered certain fish,

00:01:12.464 --> 00:01:14.544
the fishermen would take a rubbing from these fish

00:01:14.544 --> 00:01:17.213
and release them.

00:01:17.213 --> 00:01:18.070
To make the rubbing,

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:20.677
they would paint the fish with non-toxic sumi-e ink

00:01:20.677 --> 00:01:22.766
and print them on rice paper.

00:01:22.766 --> 00:01:24.509
This way they could be released

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.857
or cleaned and sold at market.

00:01:26.857 --> 00:01:29.500
The first prints like this were for records only

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.271
with no extra details.

00:01:31.271 --> 00:01:33.113
It wasn't until the mid 1800's

00:01:33.113 --> 00:01:34.908
that they began painting eye details

00:01:34.908 --> 00:01:37.498
and other embellishments onto the prints.

00:01:37.498 --> 00:01:40.911
One famous nobleman, Lord Sakai, was an avid fisherman,

00:01:40.911 --> 00:01:42.330
and, when he made a large catch,

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:44.032
he wanted to preserve the memory

00:01:44.032 --> 00:01:46.322
of the large, red sea bream.

00:01:46.322 --> 00:01:50.212
To do so, he commissioned a fisherman to print his catch.

00:01:50.212 --> 00:01:52.307
After this, many fisherman would bring

00:01:52.307 --> 00:01:54.598
their Gyotaku prints to Lord Sakai,

00:01:54.598 --> 00:01:55.794
and if he liked their work,

00:01:55.794 --> 00:01:57.685
he would hire them to print for him.

00:01:57.685 --> 00:02:01.484
Many prints hung in the palace during the Edo period.

00:02:01.484 --> 00:02:04.108
After this period, Gyotaku was not as popular

00:02:04.108 --> 00:02:06.653
and began to fade away.

00:02:06.653 --> 00:02:09.113
Today, Gyotaku has become a popular art form,

00:02:09.113 --> 00:02:10.407
enjoyed by many.

00:02:10.407 --> 00:02:13.076
And the prints are said to bring good luck to the fishermen.

00:02:13.076 --> 00:02:15.844
But the art form is quite different than it used to be.

00:02:15.844 --> 00:02:19.387
Most artists today learn on their own by trial and error.

00:02:19.387 --> 00:02:21.376
Before the artist begins to print,

00:02:21.376 --> 00:02:23.848
the fish needs to be prepared for printing.

00:02:23.848 --> 00:02:25.849
First, the artist places the fish

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:27.517
on a hollowed out surface.

00:02:27.517 --> 00:02:29.420
Then the artist spreads the fins out

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.480
and pins them down on the board to dry.

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.864
They then clean the fish with water.

00:02:33.864 --> 00:02:35.348
When it comes time to print,

00:02:35.348 --> 00:02:37.316
there are two different methods.

00:02:37.316 --> 00:02:40.603
The indirect method begins with pasting moist fabric or paper

00:02:40.603 --> 00:02:43.106
onto the fish using rice paste.

00:02:43.106 --> 00:02:45.243
Then, the artist uses a tompo,

00:02:45.243 --> 00:02:46.905
or a cotton ball covered in silk,

00:02:46.905 --> 00:02:50.532
to put ink on the fabric or paper to produce the print.

00:02:50.532 --> 00:02:52.117
This method requires more skill

00:02:52.117 --> 00:02:53.841
and great care needs to be taken

00:02:53.841 --> 00:02:55.610
when pulling the paper off the fish

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:58.623
so the paper doesn't tear.

00:02:58.623 --> 00:02:59.591
In the direct method,

00:02:59.591 --> 00:03:01.674
the artist paints directly on the fish,

00:03:01.674 --> 00:03:05.589
and then gently presses the moist fabric or paper into the fish.

00:03:05.589 --> 00:03:06.926
With both of these methods,

00:03:06.926 --> 00:03:08.833
no two prints are exactly alike,

00:03:08.833 --> 00:03:11.922
but both reveal dramatic images of the fish.

00:03:11.922 --> 00:03:13.055
For the final touch,

00:03:13.055 --> 00:03:15.223
the artist uses a chop, or a stamp,

00:03:15.223 --> 00:03:16.903
and signs their work,

00:03:16.903 --> 00:03:18.226
and can hold it up to say,

00:03:18.226 --> 00:03:21.119
"The fish was exactly this big!"
