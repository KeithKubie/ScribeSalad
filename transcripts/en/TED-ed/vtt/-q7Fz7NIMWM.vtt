00:00:06.654 --> 00:00:07.967
Ah, spring.

00:00:07.967 --> 00:00:11.738
Grass growing, flowers blooming,
trees growing new leaves,

00:00:11.738 --> 00:00:13.567
but if you get allergies,

00:00:13.567 --> 00:00:19.136
this explosion of new life probably
inspires more dread than joy.

00:00:19.136 --> 00:00:23.127
Step outside, and within minutes,
you're sneezing and congested.

00:00:23.127 --> 00:00:24.421
Your nose is running,

00:00:24.421 --> 00:00:26.283
your eyes are swollen and watery,

00:00:26.283 --> 00:00:27.896
your throat is itchy.

00:00:27.896 --> 00:00:32.559
For you and millions of others,
it's seasonal allergy time.

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:35.492
So what's behind this onslaught of mucus?

00:00:35.492 --> 00:00:38.328
The answer lies within you.

00:00:38.328 --> 00:00:39.775
It's your immune system.

00:00:39.775 --> 00:00:44.245
Seasonal allergies, also called hay fever,
or allergic rhinitis,

00:00:44.245 --> 00:00:49.205
are a hypersensitive immune response
to something that's not actually harmful.

00:00:49.205 --> 00:00:51.067
Pollen from trees and grass,

00:00:51.067 --> 00:00:56.442
and mold spores from tiny fungi
find their way into your mucous membranes

00:00:56.442 --> 00:00:59.182
and your body attacks 
these innocuous travelers

00:00:59.182 --> 00:01:02.303
the same way it would infectious bacteria.

00:01:02.303 --> 00:01:04.366
The immune system has a memory.

00:01:04.366 --> 00:01:07.552
When a foreign substance gets tagged
as threatening,

00:01:07.552 --> 00:01:10.476
white blood cells produce 
customized antibodies

00:01:10.476 --> 00:01:14.309
that will recognize the offender
the next time around.

00:01:14.309 --> 00:01:17.432
They then promptly recruit
the body's defense team.

00:01:17.432 --> 00:01:20.751
But sometimes, the immune system
accidentally discriminates

00:01:20.751 --> 00:01:24.096
against harmless substances,
like pollen.

00:01:24.096 --> 00:01:27.887
When it wafts in again, antibodies
on the surface of white blood cells

00:01:27.887 --> 00:01:30.246
recognize it and latch on.

00:01:30.246 --> 00:01:33.464
This triggers the cell to release
inflammatory chemicals,

00:01:33.464 --> 00:01:34.717
like histamine,

00:01:34.717 --> 00:01:36.427
which stimulate nerve cells,

00:01:36.427 --> 00:01:41.483
and cause blood vessels in the mucous 
membranes to swell and leak fluid.

00:01:41.483 --> 00:01:46.151
In other words, itchiness, sneezing,
congestion, and a runny nose.

00:01:46.151 --> 00:01:52.035
Allergies usually, but not always, show up
for the first time during childhood.

00:01:52.035 --> 00:01:55.640
But why do some people get allergies
and others don't?

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:00.078
Allergies tend to run in families,
so genetics may be one culprit.

00:02:00.078 --> 00:02:03.951
In fact, errors in a gene that helps
regulate the immune system

00:02:03.951 --> 00:02:06.716
are associated 
with higher rates of allergies.

00:02:06.716 --> 00:02:09.668
The environment 
you grow up in matters, too.

00:02:09.668 --> 00:02:12.216
Being exposed to an allergen as a baby

00:02:12.216 --> 00:02:15.957
makes you less likely to actually develop
an allergy to it.

00:02:15.957 --> 00:02:17.817
People who grow up on farms,

00:02:17.817 --> 00:02:18.951
in big families,

00:02:18.951 --> 00:02:22.908
and in the developing world also tend
to have fewer allergies,

00:02:22.908 --> 00:02:27.580
although there are plenty of exceptions,
partly thanks to genetics.

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:29.865
One theory is that as children,

00:02:29.865 --> 00:02:32.561
they encounter more of the microbes
and parasites

00:02:32.561 --> 00:02:36.619
that co-evolved with traditional
hunter-gatherer societies.

00:02:36.619 --> 00:02:39.128
Called the hygiene hypothesis,

00:02:39.128 --> 00:02:41.451
the idea is that when the immune system

00:02:41.451 --> 00:02:44.990
isn't exposed 
to the familiar cast of microbes,

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:49.592
it'll keep itself busy mounting
defenses against harmless substances,

00:02:49.592 --> 00:02:50.972
like pollen.

00:02:50.972 --> 00:02:55.161
Another theory is that an immune system
toughened up by a barrage of pathogens

00:02:55.161 --> 00:02:58.470
is less likely to overreact to allergens.

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:02.817
Pollen is a common offender,
just because we encounter so much of it,

00:03:02.817 --> 00:03:04.845
but there's a long list of substances:

00:03:04.845 --> 00:03:05.667
dust,

00:03:05.667 --> 00:03:06.682
animal dander,

00:03:06.682 --> 00:03:07.780
insect venom,

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:08.966
medications,

00:03:08.966 --> 00:03:10.096
certain foods,

00:03:10.096 --> 00:03:13.704
that can send your immune system
into overdrive.

00:03:13.704 --> 00:03:15.829
Some of these reactions can be scary.

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:19.175
An allergy can develop
into full-blown anaphylaxis,

00:03:19.175 --> 00:03:21.492
which typically brings on severe swelling,

00:03:21.492 --> 00:03:22.775
shortness of breath,

00:03:22.775 --> 00:03:24.965
and very low blood pressure.

00:03:24.965 --> 00:03:26.636
It can be deadly.

00:03:26.636 --> 00:03:30.568
The body can even have 
an allergic reaction to itself

00:03:30.568 --> 00:03:32.306
causing auto-immune disorders,

00:03:32.306 --> 00:03:36.622
like multiple sclerosis, lupus,
and type 1 diabetes.

00:03:36.622 --> 00:03:41.128
But even non-life threatening allergy
symptoms can make you miserable,

00:03:41.128 --> 00:03:42.799
so what can you do about it?

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:45.500
Medications can help reduce the symptoms.

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:49.071
The most common ones keep histamines
from binding to your cells.

00:03:49.071 --> 00:03:52.810
These antihistamines 
stop the inflammation response.

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:56.222
Steroids can help dial down 
the immune system.

00:03:56.222 --> 00:03:59.926
Another more permanent option
is immunotherapy.

00:03:59.926 --> 00:04:01.954
Deliberate, controlled exposure

00:04:01.954 --> 00:04:04.948
to gradually increasing 
amounts of an allergen

00:04:04.948 --> 00:04:09.458
can teach the immune system
that it isn't dangerous after all.

00:04:09.458 --> 00:04:12.929
And if you're really adventurous,
there's a less traditional option:

00:04:12.929 --> 00:04:15.341
intestinal parasites.

00:04:15.341 --> 00:04:18.719
When hookworms sink their teeth
into the intestinal wall,

00:04:18.719 --> 00:04:21.938
they secrete chemicals 
that blunt the immune system.

00:04:21.938 --> 00:04:26.349
Some studies suggest that hookworms
can treat allergies,

00:04:26.349 --> 00:04:27.508
which may be another reason

00:04:27.508 --> 00:04:30.989
allergies are more common 
in industrialized countries

00:04:30.989 --> 00:04:34.273
where hookworms are few
and far between.

00:04:34.273 --> 00:04:37.650
Of course, you can always just wait
your seasonal allergies out.

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:41.188
The spring pollen onslaught dwindles
by mid-summer,

00:04:41.188 --> 00:04:44.310
just in time for ragweed season.
