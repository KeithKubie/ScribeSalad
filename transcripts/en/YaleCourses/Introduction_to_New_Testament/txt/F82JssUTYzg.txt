Speaker 1:          00:01          We're going to continue with the lecture on the gospel of John that I talked about. Uh, last time I started last time. I want to finish up with some of the material on John that I didn't get to as much as I'd like to, and then we're going to switch to the letters of John First, second, and third, John, so we're going to do both of those things. Now remember, the rubric under which today's lecture happens is not just the gospel of John and not just the letters of John as I've brought up several times. The method that I'm teaching you right now in this class is the historical critical method as it was developed in the 20th century in Europe, in North America. This means that we're not reading these texts for just what the texts say about theology or even the early Church or doctrine or ethics or something like that.

Speaker 1:          00:50          We're trying to read the text in a way against the very intention of the text. We're taking the text as being something like a window that we can look through to try to construct as best as we can guess at it. What kind of social context, what kind of political context, what kind of church, uh, what kind of social groups these, uh, produced these texts and found them to be compelling, found them to be believable. So, um, there are lots of other ways to read this. Obviously the gospel of John is very important for Christian doctrine. It's the most, a Christological of the gospels. It has the highest form of Christology that is the Christologies, that's the most divine, uh, rather than simply being human, human. And uh, so it's very important for doctrine in, for theology and for faith. But what I'm doing right now is just one particular way of reading, which is reading this text as a clue, as a series of clues and traces that we might use to reconstruct what we think was going on in the first century with the growth of Christianity.

Speaker 1:          01:48          And I'm trying to show you by this, that there are different kinds of Christianity that grew up in different places, different geographical settings in different times. So what we call Johanan Christianity is what we're going to talk about today. And we're also, one of the wonderful things about the John Literature is that by having the Gospel, which is written, uh, at one time, and then having first John, which is a letter written after that time, we can tell that shows us a development of this form of Christianity. And then by having second and third, John, which we believe were written still later than first John, that gives us a third stage. So in fact, what I'm gonna be talking about is three or four stages in the development of Johanan Christianity as one branch of early Christian literature. So in order to do this, uh, I talked last time about how one of the things going on in the gospel of John is Jesus.

Speaker 1:          02:37          And the gospel of John Seems to start off lots of conversations and they lead to division. So the causation of division is one of the themes of the gospel of John. And to show that we're going to go walk through a couple of chapters. First look at chapter three. This is the story of Nicodemus. So get your bibles out and follow along with me because we're going to look at this in depth. They were going look at chapter eight a bit and then we're going to move off. I said division is the issue. So what we're going to talk about is what the division is. But one of the ways that this author does this is he sets up Jesus in these dialogues that don't actually work very well. Jesus is not good on interpersonal communication in the gospel of John. I'm sorry to have to tell you that and we'll talk about why that's the case.

Speaker 1:          03:24          So Jesus talks in riddles. So the question we're gonna have is why does Jesus talk in riddles and the gospel of John? What did he get out of that? Chapter three there was a pharisee named Nicodemus, a leader of the Jews. He came to Jesus by night and said to him, now by night, dark, this is kind of an thematic issue in the gospel of John, right? Notice I'm not going to bring up all these themes this time, but keep noticing these themes that I talked about last time as they occur. Even in this little passage, rabbi, we know that you are a teacher who has come from God and no one else can do these signs that you do apart from the presence of God. Jesus answered them. Very truly, I tell you, no one can see the kingdom of God without being born from above. How the hell does that follow from what Nicodemus just said?

Speaker 1:          04:17          He's a key. Gives Jesus a compliment. You're a teacher from God. No one else can do these signs that you do about the presence of God. Jesus has no one can see the Kingdom of God. What is there? Is there? Uh, thank you. Um, can Jesus say you're smart? You just got something there. No, Jesus starts off changing the subject. Jesus changes the subject and the gospel of John Quite a lot. You. No one can see the Kingdom of God without being born from above. Now you're reading it in English translation might text just said from above. Does anybody's translation have something different there besides from above without being born a new again, the problem is the Greek actually can be translated either being born again or being born all over again or being born from above. The same Greek word means both things. Now this is the one place basically in the Bible, which born again kind of language comes out.

Speaker 1:          05:16          So it's kind of ironic that there's a whole branches of American Christianity which based their entire theology and ideology on the idea. Have you been born again? Because really it's just from this passage. The other gospels don't talk about being born again. It's a rather rare metaphor in early Christianity. It comes from this chapter right here and it comes from a Greek word that could be just as easily translated, be born from above as be born again. So my English translators translated to decided to translate from above. But notice it's confusing for the here because Nicodemus then answers as if he heard it to be being born again. So Nicodemus said to him, how can anyone be born after having grown old Ken went into a second time into the mother's womb and be born? And Jesus said, Nicodemus, I'm speaking metaphorically and spiritually here. You need to understand that I don't mean particularly that someone has to be actually born physically from their mother again. No, Jesus doesn't say any of that, right? That's what Jesus should have said. Probably if Jesus really wanted to communicate with nicotine buzz, but apparently, and John Jesus is not that interested in communicating very directly with Nicodemus the cause. Jesus says, truly, I tell you, no one can enter the Kingdom of God without being born of water and spirit. What the hell does that mean?

Speaker 2:          06:47          Okay,

Speaker 1:          06:47          what is born of the flesh is flesh and what is born of the spirit is spirit. Do not be astonished that I said to you, you must be born from above. The wind blows where it chooses and you hear the sound of it, but you did not know where it comes from or where it goes.

Speaker 2:          07:02          All right. What does that mean?

Speaker 1:          07:04          Does it help you to know that the Greek word translated here? Spirit is also the Greek word which can be translated is wind. So notice the gospel of John is playing with you with puns. There's already two puns in this passage. One does the Greek word, is it Greek word f being born again or is it born from above? Well, you're not told in the text. In fact, it sounds like it may mean a little bit of both. And is this Greek Word Punch Numa? Is it supposed to represent the spirit as a theological term or is this supposed to represent breath or wind? It seems to be doing double duty anyway with all that stuff about wind blowing where it wills, so it is with everyone who's born of the spirit. Nicodemus tries one more time, said to him, how can these things be? In other words, Jesus, can you give me an explanation of what you're talking about? It's not an unreasonable request. Jesus answered, are you a teacher of Israel? And yet you don't understand these things.

Speaker 2:          08:06          Well that's helpful.

Speaker 1:          08:09          Truly, I tell you, we speak of what we know and testified to what we'd seen yet. You do not receive our testimony if I had told you about earthly things and you do not believe how you believe, I tell you about heavenly things. No one has ascended into heaven except the one who descended from heaven, the son of Man, and just as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so the son of man must be lifted up that whoever believes in him may have eternal life. Well, at this point, nicotine was just gives up. We don't hear about nicotine anymore in the story, so apparently he's decided I can't get a straight answer out of this guy.

Speaker 2:          08:37          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          08:37          and notice also how that Jesus starts off in a dialogical stance with nicotine buzz, but never answers his questions. And then Jesus almost gets kind of well nasty toward the end. He kind of just almost insults Nica demas rather than just explaining what he means. This is kind of the way Jesus sometimes talks in the gospel of John and my question is going to be why is Jesus just lacking in social skills? Look in chapter eight

Speaker 2:          09:13          let's see.

Speaker 1:          09:16          Look at chapter eight verse 31 another little interesting dialogue.

Speaker 1:          09:23          Jesus has been teaching and now Jesus said to the Jews who had believed in him. Now notice this scene starts out often in the gospel of John. The Jews are talked about as if there's something other than Jesus is of course, Jesus is a Jew, his disciples, the Jews, they're all Jews in this story, but the term the Jews gets packed in the gospel of John with this otherness and this is a reflection of that sectarianism I talked about last time, but now notice Jesus is now starting to talk to the Jews who believe in him. These are not the Jews who rejected him. That's very important to see at this point in the chapter. These are the Jews who now believe in him. If you continue in my word, you are truly my disciples and you will know the truth and the truth will make you free.

Speaker 1:          10:05          They answered him. We are the descendants of Abraham and have never been slaves to anyone. Why do you, what do you mean by saying you will be made free? And Jesus answered them? Well, I was speaking metaphorically. I meant that let's say your slaves to sin and if you follow me, then I will make you truly free in a spiritual sense. I mean, that's not what Jesus does, right? All right, 34 Jesus answered them very truly, I tell you, everyone who commits San as a slave to sin, the slave does not have a permanent place in their household. The Sun has a place there forever. So if the son makes you free, you will be free. Indeed. I know that you are descendants of Abraham, yet you look for an opportunity to kill me. Wait a minute, Jesus. These are the people who believe in you.

Speaker 2:          10:54          Oh,

Speaker 1:          10:55          because there is no place for free in you for my word. I declare what I have seen in the father's presence. As for you, you should do what you have heard from the father. They had to hand will Abraham is our father, where Jews, Jesus said to them, if you were Abraham's children, you would be doing what Abraham did, but now you are trying to kill me and a man who has told you the truth that I heard from God. That's not what Abraham did. You are indeed doing what your father said. They said him, we are not bastards. We are not illegitimate children. We have one father got himself so they try another tactic. While he won't, if you won't be satisfied with Abraham, is the bank with okay, we'll have God as our father. Jesus said, if God were your father, you would love me for I came from God and now I'm here. I did not come my own, but he sent me. Why do you not understand? What I say is because you cannot accept my word. You are from your father, the devil,

Speaker 2:          11:39          the devil.

Speaker 1:          11:40          These are the people who believe in him. It, and Jesus ends up the whole thing is I told, you know, they, they finally ended up saying, yeah, the Jews and in verse four days, did you him, are we not right in saying that you're a Samaritan and have a demon. So now they're both being antagonistic. And finally the, the chapter ends, uh, way down there as I talked about last time, uh, verse 56, your ancestor Abraham rejoiced that he would see my day. He saw it was glad. Then the Jews said to him, you are not yet 50 years old. Have you seen Abraham? Jesus said to him, very truly, I tell you before Abraham was I am. And there's that strong christological claim of God be of Jesus being God himself. And of course, so they picked up stones to throw at him, but Jesus hit himself and went out of the temple.

Speaker 1:          12:27          Notice there these things going on. Jesus speaks in riddles. And the gospel of John Jesus does not do what a good Yale instructor as opposed to do, which is explained things to you. Jesus talks in riddles when they ask questions, he responds. And with nonsequitors and then when they act like they want to believe in him, he pushes them and then start, you know, picking at him and accusing them of stuff. And eventually the scene ends up with everybody's all frustrated. Jesus is accusing them of trying to kill him and sure enough then they do start to try to kill him. And notice how in the gospel of John repeatedly these issues come down to Christology. Who is the person of Jesus? And the point at which they pick up the stones to throw at him is when he makes this claim by quoting exodus, the very name of God that Jesus himself is God. Now with all that going on, let's look at how this then plays itself out in the first letter of John

Speaker 1:          13:35          and just to back up, remember how diverse were finding Christianity, and we're going to start seeing that diversity now represented stuff in Christology, but we have seen it already in in geography, right? We've seen that in the corn to the book of acts. The Gospel spread out in concentrate circles from Jerusalem to Judea to Samarria to the ends of the earth. But we also saw how an acts, if you read it critically between the lines, you can see him. It didn't really spread that way. They were anonymous Christians who went off out of Jerusalem after a certain period of persecution and they took the message to say weenie and to different parts of the east of the, of the Mediterranean. And these were anonymous people. We don't know them, they weren't Peter. And then later Paul and Barnabas take things around and Phillip goes off to some area and maybe there's this Ethiopian Eunuch in the book of acts who's converted and he may take the gospel back to Ethiopia.

Speaker 1:          14:25          So the spread of Christianity historically was much messier than it really is portrayed in any straight forward way in the new testament. It seemed to have been spread by just people going to their home villages and hometowns and taking back this message that they had heard it different places. So the, the way the Gospel spreads, the way Christianity spreads is differently. We saw for example, then in Thomas Christianity, which seems to have been very popular in Syria and then all the way into India. That's a form of, that's a slightly different from the form of Christianity that's rising up in Rome in Rome at the time, and although church tradition says that Peter was the one who took the Gospel to Rome and founded the church there. Well, you have good re. We have good reasons as you can tell why we, historians tend to doubt that.

Speaker 1:          15:06          Why? Because we attend, we believe basically that, again, anonymous Christians who are lost to history probably were the first ones to took the gospel to Rome, and then Peter became connected up that to do with tradition. So there's a certain kind of Christianity that's growing up in Rome. There's another kind of, Christianity is growing up in Syria and India. There's another kind of Christianity this growing up in Antioch and and that part of a western Syria, and there's another chronic Christianity we don't know anything about at this point. That's probably growing up in Egypt. We just don't have enough sources to know what kind of Christianity may have been growing up in Egypt, so there's different geographical regions are experiencing different kinds of Christianity and those different kinds of Christianity are diverse with reflect to the Torah, the Jewish law, right? If there's another, if there's still a form of Christianity, this predominantly Jewish that's located in Jerusalem and it's led by James, the brother of Jesus, who seems to have been famous for advocating a certain kind of law, observant, tore obedient form of discipleship to Jesus, then you've got a form of Jewish Christianity that still seems to be keeping the law and we've seen that reflected possibly in the gospel of Matthew with it's teaching that the law is still something that people ought to obey.

Speaker 1:          16:21          We've seen though that the gospel of mark teaches a Christianity that maybe it exists. Some people say markers written in Rome, other people say maybe with mark was written in Syria or in Galilee, but with some kind of Christianity that is now predominantly gentile, although it still has Jewish elements, but these are people who are not keeping the law. They seem to believe that they don't have to keep the Jewish law. And then we've got the form of Christianity and Luke that we saw where the Torah, the law is not represents a certain kind of ethnic, um, an ethnic tradition of the Jews. So if you're Jewish, you should keep the law. But if you're a gentile, you don't need to keep the law. And then we saw from the Gospel of Thomas and the gospel of John, where is the concern about the law at all?

Speaker 1:          17:01          It's not really there. You can not read all the way through the gospel of John. Sure. There's some controversies about the sabbath, about what you can do on the sabbath. But disputes about observation of Jewish law are not really an issue in the gospel of Thomas and they're not really an issue in the gospel of John. What is at issue in the gospel of John is Christology. What do you believe about Jesus? So let's look at the different kinds of Christologies you get in early Christianity too. Before we move on to the letters first mark the gospel of John. What is Mark's Christology? What is his doctrine of Christ? Well, for one thing, according to mark, Jesus is the son of God. Now, that doesn't necessarily mean yet that Jesus is completely divine or equal God. You can be called a son of God without necessarily being God himself and this period of Christianity, but at least mark certainly considers Jesus the son of God.

Speaker 1:          17:58          He also though considers Jesus to be the Messiah. The Christ who has to suffer and use his suffering is for the purpose of ransoming us sinners. So now the Christology that Mark's working with is Jesus is the Messiah, the son of God. He's it's mandated that he suffered. So it's God's will that the Messiah suffer. And that's one of the reasons he writes his gospel is to convince his readers that Jesus is suffering and execution wasn't an accident and it wasn't a catastrophe and it was a calamity. It was God's will. It needed to happen. So the suffering son of God is part of Cri and Mark's Christology. If you get to Luke, as I've said before, this whole idea that Jesus, his death was a ransom is not in Luke. In fact, Luke excises, that part of mark when he's copying that part of mark, and he leaves out that ransom passage from mark because that doesn't fit his Christology for the, for the Christology of Luke. Do you remember Luke and acts? What does the Christology of Luke? Anybody want to venture of remembrance?

Speaker 1:          19:04          The martyr profit. Exactly. Jesus is the martyr prophet who's an example for Steven or Paul are all of us who are followers of Jesus were all martyr profits. We're called to be martyred profits. That's not a ransom for many. So Luke doesn't have a doctrine of the atonement, the Christian doctrine that says the death of Jesus was to pay for the sins of humanity or to redeem human beings from the debt of sin. So that's Luke's the gospel of Thomas. There's no death at all. And the gospel of Thomas, the Christology of the gospel of Thomas Though, is that Jesus comes across as practically an already resurrected figure. He's a knower. He's a, he's a figure of wisdom who's come from the father who had come from above and he comes to give his disciples a true knowledge. So Gilo Jesus as the revealer of hidden knowledge is the main Christology of the gospel of John. I mean the gospel of Thomas. Now the gospel of John, this is when you get closest to what will be seen as Orthodox Christianity. A lot of Orthodox Christology was set, at least at one of the main periods at the council of Nicea.

Speaker 1:          20:27          So we call this the council of Nicea. In three 25 of our RSCE was a council called together by the Emperor Constantine, who was tired of all these Christian squabbling, especially about Christology. And he got bishops and people from around the empire, and he tried to get them to come to an agreement. They wrote what has come down to be called the the nice seen creed. And a lot of Christians, Roman Catholics, Episcopalians, Anglicans, some other churches will actually say the Nicene creed in church as part of the liturgy. Right? Can anybody say it? We believe in,

Speaker 2:          21:09          yeah.

Speaker 1:          21:11          Yeah. Some of you know it. Yes. You know, the Nice increase, so that nice and creative about Jesus being very god from very God, God from God, light from light. True. Uh, big, gotten, not made because that was one of the Christological Dee Dee was so was Jesus son of God because he was born from eternity is as divine or did God say at one point, okay, he's a really good guy. I'm going to graduate him to divinity. Status was that was one Christology. So the Nicene creed said, note Jesus did not become divine. He always was divine. So the Orthodox Christology was set to a great extent by the Nicene creed in three 25 but how we're, how do we get from the year 30 when Jesus is crucified, the or 70 when the Jerusalem temple is destroyed in the gospel of Mark May have been published, the 50s when Paul was writing his letters, maybe the year in the nineties when the gospel of John is writing from the, from those times all the way to the year three 25 whether it's a whole lot of fighting going on between Christians trying to solidify what the Orthodox Christology should be and all of these different sources we've talked about.

Speaker 1:          22:17          The one that comes the closest to the Nicene creed is this Christology of the gospel of John Because according to John, Jesus is fully God co equal with the father. He's I am. That is identifying himself with the figure who appeared to Moses in the burning Bush. He's the descending and ask, sending redeemer. He's also the lamb of God sacrificed for the people and in his sacrifice he takes away the sins of the world. All of those elements that would end up becoming Orthodox Christianity, Orthodox Christology, those can be found in the gospel of John, but now how do we get from there to first? John, any questions about that? What I want you to really see is I want you to be able to anchor down, not just take my word for it, that will professor Martin knows all things about all things and he tells me that there are these different Christologies and these different early Christian documents and so that's what I'm going to write back on a paper. I don't want that. What I want you to do is be able to actually anchor down these ideas into these particular texts that come from particular different places in early Christianity. So any questions about that?

Speaker 2:          23:29          Yes sir.

Speaker 1:          23:33          The Christology of Matthew is quite a bit like mark. Matthew also believes that the death of Jesus, for example, was a, as a ransom for people and for sends, uh, uh, Matthew also that Jesus is the son of God and that he is the Messiah. Uh, exactly how divine Jesus is in the gospel of Matthew is up for grabs. It's, it's not clear, but he is. He definitely seemed to believe that Jesus is divine in some sense. So Matthew is, Christology is not too much different from Mark's. The one thing that makes him a bit different is that he seems to also take Jesus to be something like a new Moses who either who not is giving a new law, but it's interpreting the mosaic law in the proper way. So Jesus has a law giver and Jesus as a teacher is also important for Matthew's Christology. Any other questions? Okay. Look at first John, the first letter of John, right toward the end of the New Testament.

Speaker 2:          24:34          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          24:35          Now first, there are several different connections with First John Two the gospel that you can see immediately. So let's hop through the Gospel and see these first look at the very beginning. We declare to you what was from the beginning, what we have heard, what we have seen with our eyes, what we have looked at and touched with our hands concerning the word of life. That all should sound familiar. There's the seeing whoa teeth, the hearing motif, and even the touching thing. Cause if you remember, it's in the gospel of John that you have that famous scene where doubting Thomas wants to touch Jesus's body to make sure about that. This is the real Jesus. This life was revealed and we have seen it and testify to it. Testimony and testifying and witnessing as part of the gospel of John also and declare to you the eternal life.

Speaker 1:          25:18          Eternal life is one of the themes from the gospel of John that was with the father and was revealed to us. There's Jesus has the revealer. We declared what we have seen and heard so that you may also have fellowship with us and truly our fellowship is with the father and his son, Jesus Christ. We are writing these things so that our joy may be complete, so we're in the same world, the same linguistic, that'll the same discursive, the same theological world as the gospel of John. Look at one five this is the message we have heard from him and proclaim to you that God is light and in him there's no darkness. Ah, that wonderful light darkness motif. Look at verse seven if we walk in the light as he himself in the light, we have fellowship with one another and the blood of Jesus, his son cleanses us from all sin. The blood of Jesus being a significant there two two 29

Speaker 1:          26:08          if we know that he is righteous, if you know that he is righteous, you may be sure that everyone who does right has been born of him. So born of him recalls this birth stuff we've just seen in John Three in other words, and there are lots of others, if you just read through the first letter of John and you keep your ear attuned to those themes that you've already seen in the gospel of John, you can just underline them and highlight them all the way through the letter of John. So they're there. But there are some interesting problems with this letter. Also, look at chapter one verse eight if we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us. If we confess our sins, he who is faithful and just will forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness. If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar and his word is not in us. So all of us are sinners. Yay. You just have to confess your sin and Jesus lifts in kill. Your is saying, okay, we're all sinners. Anybody who says there's not, you're not centers to the problem. Look at chapter three verse five you know that he was revealed to take away sins and in him there is no sin, no one who abides in him sins.

Speaker 2:          27:22          Hmm.

Speaker 1:          27:24          I thought we just said, we're our centers. No one who sins has either seen him or know him or known him.

Speaker 2:          27:35          Hmm. That sounds a little problematic.

Speaker 1:          27:42          Everyone who commits sin is a child of the devil. For the devil has been sitting from the beginning. The son of God was revealed for this person to destroy the works of the devil. Those who have been born of God do not sin because God's seed abides in them. They cannot send because they'd been born of God. The children of God and the children of the devil are revealed in this way. All who do not do what is right or not from God, nor those who do not love their brothers and sisters. Okay? Now wait a minute. The first part, he says, we all sat and we have to confess our sins. This part it says, if you're in him, you don't sin. And if you do, send your on the devil. Look at five 18 we know that those who are born of God do not sin, but the one who is born of God protects them and the evil one does not touch them. Well, which is it? Do Christians in John's church sin or do they not send?

Speaker 2:          28:40          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          28:41          Is there a contradiction here in the text?

Speaker 2:          28:44          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          28:45          That's not the only weird place in this letter, look at what he says about love. Chapter two verse five

Speaker 1:          28:56          Chapter Two verse five whoever obeys his word, truly in this person, the love of God has reached perfection. By this we may be sure that we are in him. Okay, so love is supposed to be there. Two 10 [inaudible]. Whoever loves a brother. Now your English translation may say or sister, but the Greeks just says brother, and maybe it's post to include sisters also, but the gender of the Greek word is just brother at this point in the Greek, whoever loves his brother lives in the light and in such a person there is no cause for stumbling. Okay, so that talks about loving one's brother. Well, who is the brother? It seems like the brother for this writer are other members of the same community. He's not necessarily saying what your physical brother, your blood brother, but he's also not talking about just any human being.

Speaker 1:          29:52          Notice how this work several times. So look at two 15 so we're supposed to love and we're supposed to love our brothers, but two 15 do not love the world or the things in the world. The love of the father is not in those who love the world. Okay, so we're not supposed to love the world. Love not the world. Do not love the world. Remember the world for the word for world. I'd said last time was cosmos, the entire universe. Does this sound a little odd? If you think back on what may be the most famous verse in the entire New Testament, if you go to football games, anybody know what the most famous football verse is? John Three 16 see it. You know I'm posters. Did they still? Maybe they did that years ago. They don't still do the posters. I guessed right? Just one guy does it all over the whole NFL. Okay, so John Three 16 so yes sir.

Speaker 2:          30:53          Well, I was going to say during the bcs national championship game, the Florida quarterback war, John Three 16 on his eye, black. Did they win? They didn't win any. Made it the number one Google search during the game.

Speaker 1:          31:05          Great. So the Florida quarterback war John Three 16 on his cheeks, these cheeks I suppose. And um, and that's why they won. Okay, good. So what is John Three 16 say? Let's quote it. For God world. Y'All are wimpy. For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son. For God so loved the world. First John Two 15 do not love the world.

Speaker 2:          31:36          Hmm? Yes sir.

Speaker 1:          31:43          I believe so. I actually haven't checked. Does anybody have a Greek? Michael has a Greek. Michael is going to look it up while I continue, but this is a two 15 and see if a cosmos or some other word is the word for world though. We'll get back to you on that question. Okay, look at three one see what love the father has given us that we should be called children of God and that is what we are. The reason the world does not know us is that it did not know him. Okay, so love is part of that. Look at three 11 four this is the message you have heard from the beginning that we should love one another. Okay, so this is loving one another. It's not talking. Hear so much about loving the world. Look at three 14 we know that we have passed from death to life because we love one another.

Speaker 1:          32:32          Whoever does not love abides in deaths. Three 23 and this is his commandment that we should believe in the name of his son, Jesus Christ and love one another just as he has commanded us for seven beloved, let us love one another because love is from God. Everyone who loves is born of God and knows God for 11 a beloved. Since God loved us so much, we ought to love not the world, but one another. Verse 12 no one has ever seen God. If we love one another, God lives in us and his love is perfected in us.

Speaker 2:          33:01          What about the translation? Yep.

Speaker 1:          33:04          Okay. Same verb, same noun. And John Three 16 and uh, John First, John Two 15 so is there a contradiction? That's just all I'm asking. Where is the gospel of John Talks about God loving the world, the cosmos. And First John says you're not. Christians are not supposed to love the cosmos. Contradiction. Mom, we don't know. Maybe not. Look at four 16

Speaker 1:          33:30          so we have known and believed the love that God has for us. God is love. And those who abide in love abide in God and God abides in them. Keep reading. Love has indeed been perfected among us in this that we may have boldness in the day of judgment because as he is so are we in this world, in this world, there is no fear in love, but perfect love casts out fear for fear has to do with punishment and whoever fears has not reached perfection in love. We love because he first loved us. Those who say I love God and hate their brothers and sisters are liars and for those who do not love a brother, a sister whom they have not whom they have seen cannot love God whom they have not seen the command where we have from him is this. Those who love God must love all of humanity.

Speaker 2:          34:19          What? No,

Speaker 1:          34:22          I'm lying to you again. Follow along in your Bible. See, some of you went to sleep 21 the command, what we have from him is this. Those who love God must love their brothers. There's nothing in first John about loving the world, about loving humanity.

Speaker 2:          34:41          Okay?

Speaker 1:          34:41          About loving Amen. All humankind or mankind. There's nothing like that in the first letter of John. You have, what you do have in the first letter of John is that God is love, but that Christians, the followers of John must not love the world. The world doesn't love them. They don't love the world, does it? Again, I'm radically sectarian kind of stance. And in fact, there's nothing here about loving outsiders. According to the first letter of John. All this love that's talked about is basically centered only on the community of believers. It's an internal love. It's brotherly love, but that means that the term brothers is taken to mean me. Members of John's own community, there's nowhere that Christians in first John are told to love people outside the community. They're told repeatedly to love people inside the community. Yes, sir.

Speaker 2:          35:37          How

Speaker 1:          35:37          to brother? Just to the community of believers. Well, you just have to analyze the letter and see, you know, how does it occur here and just go through it. It's occurs all the way through. Uh, for example, I think you could definitely proved with the letters of Paul, uh, who specifically uses it for both gentiles and Jews, but only within the body of Christ. Whether that's the case here, you just have to read the letter. I would argue that it is and as precisely because I've read the letter as setting up this dichotomy between the outside cosmos and the inside brotherhood, but it's just a matter of reading the letter. The word in itself wouldn't necessarily supply that. Any other questions? Yes sir. Yes, I believe. Well, sometimes it fill out. Oh, and sometimes I got paid. Okay. And the epistles, it's almost always a guppy.

Speaker 1:          36:34          Any other questions? Okay. The radical, in other words, what I'm reading in first, John is it's representing again, a radical sectarian group. These are people who see themselves as a community set apart from the cosmos. The Cosmos is a, is a place of darkness and a place of the devil and that sort of thing. In fact. And so now it's like what is the cause of this radical sectarianism? This is the most interesting problem of the letter. Look at two 18 children. It is the last hour as you have heard that antichrist is coming. So now many antichrist have come. So there's these antichrist and knows this is they went out from among us, but they did not belong to us for if they had belonged to us, they would have remained in us. But by going out, they made it plain that none of them belongs to us.

Speaker 1:          37:24          So these are the people he's calling antichrist or people that used to be members of his own community and they left the community for some reason to, yeah, so they left that. Now Look at two 22 who is the liar, but the one who denies that Jesus is the Christ. So he's saying, you must believe that Jesus the Messiah. That's one thing. Is that the only thing? Not necessarily. This is the antichrist, the one who denies the father and the son. So some people he's saying have left the community because they're Christology is not high enough. They're not allowing the true son ship of Jesus. They're not allowing the messiahship of Jesus. They may be, you're saying he's just a prophet, or he's just a human being.

Speaker 1:          38:08          So that's one of the things that's going on. But look at five one everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ has been born of God. Everyone who loves the parent loves the child. So that's the main part about Jesus being the Christ. But now look at for chapter four verse two I'll start the beginning of chapter four. Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God. For many false prophets have out into the world. By this, you know the spirit of God. Every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God. And every spirit that does not confess Jesus is not from God. And this is the spirit of the antichrist. So one of the things that's going on here, now look at also five, eight just briefly, and we'll move on. Five, eight.

Speaker 1:          39:00          These are three that testify the spirit and the water and the blood. And these three agree. In other words, this author is objecting to some people who don't admit the messiahship of Jesus, and that may have been reflected also in the gospel. Remember, some of the reasons that some of the people there's this division is because the writer of the gospel of John believes that some people aren't willing to confess that Jesus is divine, that Jesus is the messiah that he's going to got. But now we get to a different situation. Apparently there are other people who have not come up in the community who may be accepting that Jesus was the Christ, but they're denying that he was fully human. They're denying that he was flesh and blood. And actually we do see different beginnings of different Christologies. The people we have a term for this, uh, these early Christians who said, they said that Jesus, maybe there was a human Jesus, but that's not really the Christ. The Christ was this spirit that maybe looked like he was human. In fact, some said, well, if he walked along a wet beach, he wouldn't leave footprints because he didn't have a physical body. He just was spirit. He just seemed to be a body. He seemed to be flesh and blood and that the Greek word for seem, he just looked like we'd get this term to call dust. SEDEX.

Speaker 1:          40:22          [inaudible] is the Greek word for to seem or to look like. So other Christians use this term as a label for those Christians who said Jesus wasn't truly flesh and blood, because how can a divine being be flesh and blood? That's a contradiction in terms. You can't have a being that's both God and flesh and blood because flesh and blood rots and dies and goes away. God is eternal. So God by definition can't be flesh and blood. And so they said, if Jesus is divine, he must not have been flesh and blood. He must've just seemed like he was flesh and blood. So other Christians said, oh, that's wrong. And they call these people, the seemsters does sedex. So docetism refers to a Christology that says Jesus has spirit, the Christ, his spirit, but not really flesh and blood. Human. And so notice how this author is arguing against different kinds of ideas and it shows a further split in early Christianity.

Speaker 1:          41:17          You have some people believing that Jesus was human but not fully divine. Other people believing that he was so divine that he wasn't even human. And this author is trying to hold together these two things, but now how this happened. So that's one of, that's what's going on. The Gospel of the first letter of John shows a community that's again divided, but now it's divided by some of the people within its midst going off because they thought you can't have a flesh and blood God. And therefore if you're going to have Jesus as God, he can't be flesh and blood. So they've left the community. Let's look at second. John, this is a little time and I'm going to read all the way through this one cause this is going to, we need to sort of figure what's going, it's a very short letter, the elder.

Speaker 1:          42:01          So he calls himself the elder. So he doesn't even give us his name, the elder to the elect lady and her children whom I love and the truth, and not only I, but also all who know the truth because of the truth that abides in us. And we'll be with us forever. Grace, blah, blah, blah. I was overjoyed to find some of your children walking in the truth, just as we have been commanded by the father. He's talking to an elect lady and her children, most of us think this is a metaphor that he's actually addressing this to a church. They elect lady probably means the church itself, not a particular human person, but that's just a judgment. Call my but now, Dear Lady, I asked you not as though I were writing to you a new commandment, but on one we had from the beginning.

Speaker 1:          42:38          Let us love one another. So there's that love thing. So we're nowhere. We're nowhere. It's still in the same kind of Christianity that we work with the others. This is love that we walk according to his commandments. This is the commandment. As you've heard from the beginning of this walking, many deceivers have gone out into the world. Those who do not confess that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh. There is those people again and he's such person is the deceiver and the antichrist be on your guard so that you do not lose what we have worked for, but may receive a full reward. Everyone who does not abide in the teaching of Christ but goes beyond it does not have God. Whoever abides in the teaching has both the father's son do not receive into the house or welcome anyone who comes to you and does not bring this teaching for two welcome is to participate in the evil deeds of such a person.

Speaker 1:          43:23          So the main purpose of this very short letter is to say to another church that's in the same kind of community with this one. There are people who've left our community and the reason is they don't believe Jesus was fully flesh and blood. Don't even let them come to visit you. These are traveling preachers who said, he says, don't receive them. Don't give them money. Don't give them food. Don't put them up in your guest room, just completely shunned them. So he's riding to another church because of this. Now look at Third John, the elder to the beloved Gaius. Now it's the same person writing, he says, but now it's to amending Gaius not to the elect lady. I pray that all may go well with you mean good health, blah, blah, blah, beloved, you do faithfully whatever you do for the friends, even though they are strangers to you, they have testified to your life before the church.

Speaker 1:          44:09          You will do well to send them on in a manner worthy of God, for they began their journey for the sake of Christ. Accepting no support from nonbelievers. So this is a letter that's been sent around probably with other traveling preachers, but these traveling preachers seem to be representatives of the elder himself, the author. So he's writing to a man named Gaius and says, you, you're a good guy. You receive our messengers. You receive the people that were sending around to preach. I have written something to the church. Oh, he did write a letter to the church. So now let's see what you see. He wrote another letter to the church. He's writing this letter to an individual, but Diotrephes who likes to put himself first does not acknowledge our authority. So if I come, in other words, die entre fees seems to be the leader of a church and has not allowed the elder to send his letter to that church.

Speaker 1:          45:00          He's intercepting letters and not allowing these things to be read aloud in the church. All these letters were supposed to be read aloud in churches. You see, if I come, I will call attention to what he is doing and spreading false charges against me and not content with these charges. He refuses to welcome the friends and even prevents those who want to do so and expelled them from the church. Diopter fees is refusing to welcome the messengers from the elder that the elder sent ahead of himself with the letter. That makes up second. John, is he what's going on here? There's a leader of this Joe hunting church probably after the writing of the Gospel, probably after the writing of first John and he rides second. John as a sort of introductory letter to a church and he says, I'm sending you some of my, My messengers, you know, received them.

Speaker 1:          45:49          Listen to the letter, give them what they need, help them out financially, put them up in your guest room and then send them on their way so they can travel around to other Christian churches. Something's gone wrong though. Maybe this is a different, maybe third John, we don't know. This is speculation. Maybe third John is another letter that he had to write to an individual in that town because his second John didn't work. Why it may be that those people disagreed with him about his Christology also, so they may have received the very people that he thought they shouldn't receive and so he rides. Third John Two an individual saying diopter fees is causing a bunch of problems, not receiving my messengers and not allowing my letters to be read in church. Do you see how this represents, this is all guesswork. We don't know what's going on, but we see several things about the letter.

Speaker 1:          46:41          There's a greeting, their well wishes. There's praise of the reputation and behavior. The recipients. He is, he attempts to establish a relationship. He talks to this person of this. He's a father, son or a patron client relationship and there's a letter of recommendation, send them on. This is what you do in the ancient world. You give a messenger and there's no post office. You know, you give a letter to someone who's traveling and that person gets to a friend of yours to where it doesn't and they show the letter. That letter is read outside of read aloud to the group and then you put that person up or those people up, you host them for a while, they talk and you share your messages and then you send them on. We give them a little bit of financial support to send them on their way to the rest of the travel.

Speaker 1:          47:22          So that's clearly what's going on. And both of these letters are letters of recommendation, typical letters of recommendation. But what makes it interesting is that second John seems to have been a letter of recommendation that didn't work, maybe. And then third, John had to be written to an individual because his letter couldn't get through to the whole church. So what's the cause of this division? Clearly the cause of division and the gospel of John is that some people are not accepting a high enough christology. They're not accepting that Jesus is truly divine. They might be accepting that Jesus is human, but not that he's divine. The situation has shifted slightly by the time we get to the first John the letter because there it seems like, yes, he's talked about some people are antichrist because they've denied that Jesus the Messiah, but other people are antichrist because they've denied that Jesus' flesh and he says they've gone out from among us.

Speaker 1:          48:22          So the church has been split again on the issue of Christology, but now the Christology is one. Do you accept the full flushness of Jesus? But then when you get to second John in third, John the split is the split now doctrinal, is it Christological or is this just a split over who gets to be the leader? Who gets to be the recognized leader of these church, these churches? Is it the elder to his letters have to be accepted in his emissaries, get accepted in different churches, or is it this Guy Die Otra fees? Is he sort of trying to buck the elder for the leadership and is there dispute over Christology? Do they disagree about Christology or is it now a purely a personnel leadership issue? It's very difficult to see, but you can very quickly see how though in these by looking at these four different documents, the gospel of John First, John Second, John Third, John Four different documents which may have been written in this, not by the same person, we don't think they're all written by the same person, but they're clearly written by the same school of early Christianity.

Speaker 1:          49:28          They share enough of the vocabulary, enough theology, and you can almost see four different stages of development and you see what we might expect. I remember I said that and grown up in Texas where I was said, let's make like a Baptist church and split early churches also seemed to split a lot. Is that what we see here, four different stages of a church with different kinds of divisions happening and therefore different kinds of Christianity developing to do to these divisions. Very possibly. Any questions about that? Questions, comments, outbursts? Now, what I've just given you is one reading of these texts and I've done a lot of speculating. For example, you could just say, well, second, John May have been written to one church and third, John's written to a totally, completely geographical region. That's entirely possible. I think it's interesting to put them in this way and read them this way, but that's just one historical reconstruction because a lot of what I'm teaching you is let's, how do you imagine history developing if all you have are these texts by which you construct the history of the early church. Next time we're going to shift gears dramatically because now we're not going to be talking about the historical situation of the text. We're going to be talking about how do you get through all these texts to try to figure out the historical Jesus himself? Did Jesus of Nazareth Really Exist? What did he do? What did he say? What did he think of himself? That's what we'll talk about next time.
