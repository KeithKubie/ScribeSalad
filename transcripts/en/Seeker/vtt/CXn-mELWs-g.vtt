00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.760
People tend to do this weird thing when they
meet a dog — we call them strange names

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:10.759
like sweetie-face and ask them if they know
they’re so cute! — in that odd, slow tempo,

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:13.450
higher pitched speech pattern we also use
with babies.

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:16.570
It’s actually a real thing called Pet Directed
Speech or PDS.

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:18.630
And a lot of us do it.

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:19.630
I know I do.

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:23.380
I talk to Pete differently when I’m leaving
than I do when we’re hanging out cuddling.

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:24.550
But he’s a cat so it’s moot…

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:30.130
But I do wonder if he notices or cares, and
likewise, if dogs care about how their owners

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:31.130
talk to them?

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:35.400
A study looked at how owners talk to their
dogs, specifically female owners.

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:40.060
In this study, 34 adult women were recorded
interacting with their dogs in four instances:

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:50.230
before being separated, reuniting after said
separation, playing, and giving commands.

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:55.030
They found the intricacies of PDS changed
— the women used a lower pitch before separation,

00:00:55.030 --> 00:01:00.270
a high pitch upon reuniting, a questioning
tone during play, and imperatives in giving

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.930
commands coupled with attention-getting measures.

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:07.080
Female owners, the study found, adapt their
verbal cues to the situation, giving their

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.890
pet hints about their intentions and emotions.

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:12.890
But does this really mean that pets care about
your tone of voice?

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:13.890
Maybe not.

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.000
Another study recorded women delivering a
set line — “Hi!

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.220
Hello cutie!

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:19.220
Who’s a good boy?

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:20.220
Come here!

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.220
Good boy!

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:22.220
Yes!

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:23.220
Come here sweetie pie!

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.830
What a good boy!” — to pictures of puppies,
adult dogs, and old dogs, then analyzed the

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:31.010
quality of their speech to find people use
a higher pitch with puppies.

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:35.680
The recordings were then played back to dogs
alongside normal speech to gauge reactions.

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:39.840
The researchers found that puppies reacted
more to dog-directed speech, specifically

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.530
that higher pitch got their attention whereas
older dogs didn’t really react more strongly

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:46.600
to one tone over another.

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.590
Older dogs, the researchers found, were more
responsive to a familiar voice.

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:52.310
Another study adds to this.

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:57.450
The researchers videoed 44 adult pet dogs
and 19 puppies listening to a voice recording

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.830
of a set phrase enounced in either Adult Directed
Speech, Pet Directed Speech, or Infant Directed

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:03.830
Speech.

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:06.671
They were looking for gaze as a measure of
the dogs’ attention and reaction to the

00:02:06.671 --> 00:02:07.870
voice recordings.

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:12.200
In this study, the adult dogs showed more
responsiveness than puppies to Pet than Adult

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:13.430
Directed Speech.

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:16.189
So we’ve got conflicting studies… what’s
actually going on here?

00:02:16.189 --> 00:02:19.159
Well, it’s difficult to really know without
further research.

00:02:19.159 --> 00:02:21.969
But there might be more to it than just speech
patterns.

00:02:21.969 --> 00:02:25.950
Dogs specifically are more in tune to human
body language than most animals — about

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.680
the level of an infant — which might be
why humans started domesticating them in the

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:30.680
first place.

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.849
And many owners feel their bond with a pet
is as strong as that with any human companion.

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:38.109
So perhaps it all comes down to the bond we
have with our own pets.

00:02:38.109 --> 00:02:42.290
While puppies are excited by anything and
everything new, the older dogs responsiveness

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:46.730
to a familiar voice does suggest that it’s
an owner-related reaction more than anything.

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:50.299
But hey, that won’t stop me from using weird
voices when I talk to Pete!

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:53.650
So that’s dogs and language, but what about
humans and language?

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:58.319
We looked into how bilingual brains perceive
time in this episode right here.

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:00.120
What weird ways do you talk to your pets?
