00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.980
(light music)

00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:05.080
- [Narrator] Today,
about 4.2 billion people

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:07.320
have access to a world of information

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:09.380
never before seen.

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:11.710
Such an extraordinary
level of connectedness

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:14.390
has revolutionized everything.

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:16.137
From science and technology,

00:00:16.137 --> 00:00:18.984
to commerce and romance,

00:00:18.984 --> 00:00:22.433
and virtually every aspect of out lives.

00:00:25.464 --> 00:00:26.530
(upbeat music)

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:29.430
Of all the technological
innovations in history,

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:33.460
few have made as strong of
an impact as the internet.

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:36.160
Comprised by a global
network of computers,

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:38.090
the internet allows for the transmission

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:39.910
of information and connectivity

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:42.593
at an unprecedented speed and scale.

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:45.880
Some of the first computer networks

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:48.720
began in the 1950s and 60s,

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:50.960
but unlike today's global network,

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.040
these early networks were centralized

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:56.050
within certain businesses and agencies.

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:59.900
It wasn't until 1969 when
centralized computer networks

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:01.183
became connected.

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.280
Funded by the US Department of Defense,

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.350
and developed by universities,

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.560
this host-to-host network
connection, called ARPANET,

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.820
a direct ancestor of the internet,

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.120
was the first of its kind.

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.650
The network grew, and by the 1980s,

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:20.360
incorporate networks at
research institutions

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.600
and other US Federal agencies,

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.490
such as the National
Science Foundation, or NSF.

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.680
The NSF connected these disparate networks

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.250
into one large one.

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:32.820
NSFNET, which shifted over from being

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.910
a federally run network
to a commercial enterprise

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:37.733
for internet service providers.

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:40.550
- Telecommunications is going to become

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:42.820
much much more important.

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:44.294
Your computer is going to become

00:01:44.294 --> 00:01:46.300
your window into the world, really,

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:47.133
in some degree.

00:01:47.999 --> 00:01:50.550
(modem connection noises)

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:52.280
- [Narrator] By the late 1990s,

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.770
this shift, along with the
rise of personal computers,

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.510
the world wide web, and web browsers,

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:01.010
allowed the general public
to access the internet

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:02.683
for the very first time.

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:06.860
Today, computers, smart
phones, televisions,

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:09.430
video game consoles, and other devices,

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:10.880
all tap into the network,

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:13.910
and transmit and receive
data almost instantly.

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:17.760
For example, by clicking
send in messaging apps,

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.060
text, audio, and video are converted

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.330
into pieces of electronic
data called packets.

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:25.610
These packets are then
tagged with a port number

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:27.310
and IP address.

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:29.810
Much like the mailing
address on an envelope,

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:32.710
the port number and IP
address direct the packets

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:35.750
to a given destination on the internet.

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:37.980
From there, the packets may travel

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:42.360
over Wifi, cellular data, or
an ethernet or phone line.

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.420
Through a series of routers,
modems, and servers,

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.240
then through fiber optic
cables or satellites,

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.760
and through a similar process in reverse

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.240
to reach the packets destination.

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:54.800
Once the packets arrive,

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:56.950
their data is reassembled into the text,

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:59.153
audio, or video that was originally sent.

00:03:00.676 --> 00:03:01.700
(machine buzzing)
(light music)

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:04.720
Since the days of the
earliest computer networks,

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:07.930
the internet has undergone
a tremendous transformation,

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:11.270
while also transforming
the world that created it.

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:12.860
From a closed off network,

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:14.710
to one that covers the globe,

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:17.270
the internet has provided
access to information

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:18.790
to every continent,

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:22.223
connecting people and
ideas like never before.
