&gt;&gt;Fernando Nilo - Davos Debates 2009

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:06.390
Hi YouTube community. My name is Fernando
Nilo. I am a [inaudible] entrepeneur from

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:12.590
[inaudible] and I'm here in Davos and I would
like to share my dream, mass ideas with the

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:20.370
community. We are recycling the e-waves, the
new ways of the century. Fax, scanner, DVD,

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:25.170
cellular, whatever you think it is electronics
are at the end of the line. In our labor jobs,

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.680
is the people who are in jail. They get the
freedom, nobody offer the job and then we

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:36.280
offer them a second chance at life. We are
recycling both people and the new ways of

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:43.760
the century. We would love to communicate
with you, to invite, to recycle property.

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:54.140
To invite to win the global warming problem
with recycling. Recycling is solution for

00:00:54.140 --> 00:01:02.230
the future. I would love to turn people, entrepeneurs,
CEO, OEM, everybody to think about the green

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:09.649
seal, looking for recycling and this is our
future. We should build together, a better

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:10.820
world together.
