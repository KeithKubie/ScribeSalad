00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:06.840
All of us were parented. For many of us, it
went well. We were loved, our views were respected,

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:13.730
our needs were tended to. It helped to make
us the more or less sane people we are now.

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:19.240
For others among us, things went really rather
badly wrong. Perhaps there was unreliability,

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:23.640
anger, humiliation, violence or worse.

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.650
If there was, we’re liable to have been
deeply marked. We may, even if it all happened

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.780
quite a number of years ago now, keep noticing
new ways in which the past is getting in the

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:40.820
way of a good life in the present. Our inadequate
parenting experiences undermine our ability

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:46.340
to have sound relationships, the right sort
of confidence and to extend adequate nurture

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:48.030
to ourselves.

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.990
We would like, of course, to move on. There
is something unbalanced and deeply cruel in

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:59.410
the idea of the first 12 years determining
the next 50.

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:05.869
We cannot change the past, but it does remain
open to us to correct at least some of its

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:06.869
repercussions.

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:14.420
We may learn to do this through a neglected
and yet deeply powerful process we call re-parenting.

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:19.200
How our parents behaved will have laid down
a template in our minds about how we should

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.700
respond to challenges. But we don’t need
to remain forever stuck with the kind of care

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:27.990
which we imbibed in the early years.

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:33.259
We by nature have an ability to parent ourselves.
What this means is, an ability to

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:38.289
- comfort ourselves at moments of difficulty
- to interpret the troubles that beset us

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:43.130
with imagination and kindness
- to encourage ourselves in the face of anxiety

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:47.349
and loss
- and to reassure the more fragile, agitated

00:01:47.349 --> 00:01:52.829
parts of us by drawing upon our experience
and our serene aspects

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:58.469
All this is what good parents do for their
children, but if this did not happen to us,

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:04.749
we can still - in adulthood - step in and
do it for ourselves. One part of the mind

00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:10.989
can speak to the other, one part can act as
the sane, resilient counterweight to the bruised

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:12.540
more immature side of the self.

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.540
We don’t need to be limited in our spirit
by those who were meant to care for us, we

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:18.250
can figuratively put an arm around our own
shoulder.

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:23.750
Our experience of the shortfalls of our own
parents offer us an expertise that is wasted

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:29.970
if it stays stuck at the level of criticism.
It should become the template for a far more

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:36.489
useful project: the creation of an inner ideal
parent, who acts in all the ways in which

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:40.010
the real thing should have done, but didn’t
quite.

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:45.150
Knowing so much about what we did not have
enables us to be experts at what we need - and

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.650
should believe we can provide for ourselves.

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:54.390
We already have the perfect inner parent;
it’s simply in many ways the opposite of

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:55.939
the one we had.

00:02:55.939 --> 00:03:02.280
Though childhood is a one off event in material
time, in psychological time, it is endlessly

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:07.670
recurring. The eight year old us is still
there - and we can talk to it and respond

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:13.840
to it in a way that allows it to mature and
strengthen in the way it always should.

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:20.560
We should make use of a much underestimated
capacity of reparenting ourselves.
