00:00:03.533 --> 00:00:06.643
Taylor Sterling is the world's fastest guitar player,

00:00:06.643 --> 00:00:11.533
able to play Flight of the Bumblebee
at 999 beats per minute.

00:00:14.943 --> 00:00:19.273
What the FAK?
The Facts and Knowledge on Speed.

00:00:20.342 --> 00:00:24.463
Italian physicist Galileo was credited
with being the first to measure speed

00:00:24.463 --> 00:00:27.493
by using the distance covered
and the time it takes.

00:00:27.493 --> 00:00:30.583
Nothing is considered to go faster
than the speed of light

00:00:30.583 --> 00:00:36.743
at 299,792,458 meters per second

00:00:36.743 --> 00:00:39.573
which is the cornerstone
of Einstein's theory of relativity.

00:00:39.573 --> 00:00:42.463
The first quantitative estimate
of the speed of light

00:00:42.463 --> 00:00:46.113
was made in 1676 by Ole Romer.

00:00:46.113 --> 00:00:49.863
It's plain to see the power of speed
when looking at tornados.

00:00:49.863 --> 00:00:54.233
The fastest recorded tornado
was on May 3, 1999 in Oklahoma City.

00:00:54.773 --> 00:00:59.233
The tornado had a wind speed
of 318 miles per hour.

00:00:59.233 --> 00:01:03.403
When it comes to the animal kingdom,
the fastest on land is the cheetah.

00:01:03.403 --> 00:01:07.253
It can run between 70 and 75 miles per hour

00:01:07.253 --> 00:01:12.203
and has the ability to accelerate
from 0 to 68 in three seconds

00:01:12.203 --> 00:01:14.483
which is faster than most cars.

00:01:14.483 --> 00:01:16.713
In the water, the sailfish prevails

00:01:16.713 --> 00:01:20.223
as the fastest swimmer
at around 70 miles per hour.

00:01:20.223 --> 00:01:23.483
But the sky is where you'll find
the fastest animal of all.

00:01:23.483 --> 00:01:26.593
The peregrine falcon is renowned for its speed

00:01:26.593 --> 00:01:31.113
reaching over 200 miles per hour
during its high-speed dives.

00:01:31.113 --> 00:01:33.963
While humans may not be able
to outrun a cheetah,

00:01:33.963 --> 00:01:38.173
they can perform a variety
of tasks very quickly such as drumming.

00:01:38.173 --> 00:01:40.413
George Urosevic of Australia

00:01:40.413 --> 00:01:44.413
achieved 1553 drum beats in one minute.

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:49.900
There's some incredibly
fast rappers out there

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:51.900
including Twista and No Clue,

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:54.950
but here's Rebel XD
breaking a speed rapping record

00:01:54.950 --> 00:02:00.680
by clocking in an impressive
683 syllables in 54.5 seconds.

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:04.860
[speed rapping]

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.670
Steve Whitmore beat out the famous micromachines guy

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:09.720
as the world's fastest talker.

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.450
He can say 637 words per minute.

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.088
[speed reading]

00:02:16.088 --> 00:02:18.568
It's hard to talk when you're
shoving food in your face

00:02:18.568 --> 00:02:21.168
as quickly as possible like Kobeyashi

00:02:21.168 --> 00:02:24.178
who holds competitive eating records
in meatballs, Twinkies,

00:02:24.178 --> 00:02:26.108
and several other foods.

00:02:26.108 --> 00:02:29.598
Or like Peter Czerwinski, AKA Furious Pete.

00:02:29.598 --> 00:02:32.298
He holds the record
for eating a whole raw onion

00:02:32.298 --> 00:02:34.818
in 43.53 seconds.

00:02:34.818 --> 00:02:36.708
And Joey Chesnut is the current champ

00:02:36.708 --> 00:02:39.218
of the Nathan's hot dog eating contest,

00:02:39.218 --> 00:02:41.438
winning six titles in a row,

00:02:41.438 --> 00:02:45.378
devouring 68 hotdogs and buns in ten minutes.

00:02:45.378 --> 00:02:48.308
Those guys might want to do some running
after digesting all that food,

00:02:48.308 --> 00:02:51.068
but they'll never go as fast as Usain Bolt.

00:02:51.068 --> 00:02:53.118
Born in 1986, the Jamaican sprinter

00:02:53.118 --> 00:02:55.718
is a three-time Olympic gold medalist

00:02:55.718 --> 00:02:59.928
for the 100 meter, 200 meters,
and the four by 100 relay.

00:02:59.928 --> 00:03:04.168
He ran an incredible 27.79 miles per hour

00:03:04.168 --> 00:03:06.038
during the 100-meter sprint.

00:03:06.038 --> 00:03:08.388
Running through Super Mario Brothers
at a ridiculous speed

00:03:08.388 --> 00:03:10.738
is Andrew Gardikis
who holds a world record

00:03:10.738 --> 00:03:14.428
with 4 minutes and 58 seconds
to complete the entire game.

00:03:14.428 --> 00:03:17.638
It's a speed run
without any cheats or assistance,

00:03:17.638 --> 00:03:20.928
and the time
that he claims is unbeatable.

00:03:20.984 --> 00:03:23.888
When it comes to unbeatable gunslingers,
there's Bob Munden.

00:03:23.888 --> 00:03:28.108
Munden owns eighteen world records
for fast draw competition

00:03:28.108 --> 00:03:32.748
with his unbelievably quick draw
being clocked at two one hundredths of a second.

00:03:32.748 --> 00:03:36.448
Let's give him a round of applause,
courtesy of the fastest clapper.

00:03:36.448 --> 00:03:40.538
Ken French clapped a world record
721 times in a minute

00:03:40.538 --> 00:03:43.928
at a pace of about twelve claps per second.

00:03:46.538 --> 00:03:48.868
If that doesn't blow your mind,
check out the world record

00:03:48.868 --> 00:03:53.938
for solving a Rubik's Cube
blindfolded, 28.8 seconds.

00:03:53.938 --> 00:03:56.227
When it comes to roller coasters,
the Formula Rossa

00:03:56.227 --> 00:03:59.967
at Ferrari World in Abu Dhabi
outruns the competition.

00:03:59.967 --> 00:04:02.797
It tops out at 150 miles per hour

00:04:02.797 --> 00:04:05.707
and accelerate in about 4.9 seconds

00:04:05.707 --> 00:04:07.947
using a hydraulic launch system.

00:04:07.947 --> 00:04:10.657
Mitsubishi developed the fastest elevators.

00:04:10.657 --> 00:04:13.377
They'll be located
in the Shanghai Tower in China,

00:04:13.377 --> 00:04:15.747
and they travel 59 feet a second

00:04:15.747 --> 00:04:19.267
and cover a distance of over 3000 feet per minute

00:04:19.267 --> 00:04:24.357
which will eclipse the current fastest elevators
in the Taipei 101 Tower in Taiwan.

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:29.017
The world's fastest camera is being used
to detect rogue cancer cells.

00:04:29.017 --> 00:04:31.377
The new optical microscope has the ability

00:04:31.377 --> 00:04:36.717
to detect rare cells with the sensitivity
of one part per million in real time.

00:04:36.717 --> 00:04:40.137
There's also a new player
in the world's fastest computer game

00:04:40.137 --> 00:04:42.517
developed by IBM.

00:04:42.517 --> 00:04:46.147
Sequoyah achieved 16.32 petaflops per second

00:04:46.147 --> 00:04:50.947
using 1,572,874 cores.

00:04:50.947 --> 00:04:54.277
Roughly capable of calculating in one hour

00:04:54.277 --> 00:04:58.287
what it would take 6.7 billion people
using hand calculators

00:04:58.287 --> 00:05:02.407
320 years of nonstop computing
to complete.

00:05:02.994 --> 00:05:05.527
Topping out at 268 miles per hour,

00:05:05.527 --> 00:05:07.727
the Bugatti Veyron Super Sport

00:05:07.727 --> 00:05:10.447
is the world's fastest production car.

00:05:10.447 --> 00:05:13.827
It boasts 1183 metric horsepower

00:05:13.827 --> 00:05:16.977
and costs around two and a half million dollars.

00:05:16.977 --> 00:05:20.037
The land speed record held by the Thrust SSC

00:05:20.037 --> 00:05:25.117
broke the sound barrier with a speed
of 763 miles per hour.

00:05:25.117 --> 00:05:28.717
But looking to demolish that record
is the Bloodhound SSC.

00:05:28.717 --> 00:05:31.427
Sporting a jet and hybrid rocket,

00:05:31.427 --> 00:05:33.447
the target of the supersonic car project

00:05:33.447 --> 00:05:36.347
is 1000 miles per hour.

00:05:36.347 --> 00:05:38.427
Currently holding the world record
for fastest train

00:05:38.427 --> 00:05:40.517
is the MLX01,

00:05:40.517 --> 00:05:42.627
a Japanese magnetic levitation train

00:05:42.627 --> 00:05:46.877
capable of a maximum speed of 361 miles per hour.

00:05:46.877 --> 00:05:50.807
The maximum speed in service
was set by the Shanghai Maglev Train

00:05:50.807 --> 00:05:54.827
reaching 268 miles per hour
during its daily service.

00:05:54.827 --> 00:05:58.757
When it comes to water speed records,
there's the spirit of Australia

00:05:58.757 --> 00:06:03.157
reaching 317 miles per hour in 1978.

00:06:03.157 --> 00:06:05.747
Rocky Robinson
set a world land speed record

00:06:05.747 --> 00:06:08.467
for a two-wheel streamlined motorcycle

00:06:08.467 --> 00:06:12.467
at 376 miles per hour.

00:06:15.177 --> 00:06:18.487
Flying with incredible speed is
the North American X-15,

00:06:18.487 --> 00:06:21.997
a rocket-powered aircraft
with the official world record for speed

00:06:21.997 --> 00:06:24.837
topping out with a flight in 1967

00:06:24.837 --> 00:06:28.777
that reached 4519 miles per hour.

00:06:28.777 --> 00:06:30.867
And the X-15 flew so high

00:06:30.867 --> 00:06:34.687
that pilots who reached an altitude
of fifty miles or more

00:06:34.687 --> 00:06:36.947
were considered astronauts.

00:06:36.947 --> 00:06:39.667
NASA has joined forces
with Boeing and Gulfstream

00:06:39.667 --> 00:06:41.667
to create a supersonic jet

00:06:41.667 --> 00:06:45.467
capable of flying
from London to Sydney in four hours.

00:06:45.467 --> 00:06:49.997
The Concord Jet topped out
at about 1350 miles per hour

00:06:49.997 --> 00:06:54.927
while this new one looks to reach
a top speed of 2500 miles per hour.

00:06:54.927 --> 00:06:59.507
Finally, flying ludicrously fast
is the Falcon Hypersonic Technology Vehicle-2

00:06:59.507 --> 00:07:00.967
developed by DARPA.

00:07:00.967 --> 00:07:03.487
They're creating rocket-launched,
unmanned gliders

00:07:03.487 --> 00:07:07.917
designed to fly 20 times
the speed of sound, or Mach 20,

00:07:07.917 --> 00:07:10.777
which is about 13,000 miles per hour,

00:07:10.777 --> 00:07:13.517
and their goal is to give the U.S.
a defense capability

00:07:13.517 --> 00:07:17.757
of reaching and/or deploying
anywhere on Earth in an hour.

00:07:17.757 --> 00:07:19.377
I'm going to leave you with this guy.

00:07:19.377 --> 00:07:22.887
He set the first world motorcycle
speed record in 1903.

00:07:22.887 --> 00:07:25.487
Who is he and how fast did he go?

00:07:25.487 --> 00:07:27.577
Before we go, here is last video's winner.

00:07:27.577 --> 00:07:30.307
