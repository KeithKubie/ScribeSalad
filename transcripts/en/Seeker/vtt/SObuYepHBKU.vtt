00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.149
Life, as anyone will tell you, is not fair.
But how important is fairness?

00:00:07.149 --> 00:00:13.160
Hello everyone, Crystal here for DNews.

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:18.320
Let’s play a game, I’m given $100 and
I can choose to offer to give some, or none,

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:23.220
to you. If you accept my offer, we both get
to keep the money, but if you don’t, we

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.680
both get nothing. How much of the 100 would
I have to offer you before you’d accept?

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:29.680
$20?

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:30.680
40?

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:32.210
How would you feel if I offered you $3?

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:36.989
You’d probably leave us both with nothing
just to spite me for being greedy. Right?

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.440
This set up is called an Ultimatum Game, and
it is used by behavioral scientists to study

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:46.600
the construct of “fairness”. In human
adults, any offer lower than 20% of the total

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:51.260
is usually rejected and researchers conclude
that this stems from a common expectation

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.300
of “fairness”. But how do we decide what’s
“fair”?

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.960
Our idea of fair changes over time. For children
younger than school age, what is fair is usually

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.609
what is equal. (When my sister was little,
she could never understand why I would get

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:08.010
more of something because I was older) but
as we develop, our sense of fairness shifts

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.049
to become rooted in merit based reasoning,
that’s why in adults it is more common for

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:16.890
higher value individuals be the most rewarded,
and researchers at MIT and the University

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.770
of Rochester recently proposed that this shift
correlates to when we learn to count.

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:26.689
These researchers studied 70 children between
the ages of 3 and 12 that belonged to the

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:31.700
Tsimane' tribe in the Amazon. Each child was
shown two drawings of identical children.

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.720
Then they were told that the children in the
drawings were sent to pick bananas, one child

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:40.990
had worked very hard and brought back 18 bananas,
and the other picked only 4. The researchers

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:45.229
then gave the participant children an even
number of paper cookies and asked them to

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:49.540
distribute the cookies as a reward to the
banana pickers. Children that could count,

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:54.020
distributed more reward cookies to the successful
banana picker instead of distributing cookies

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:55.570
evenly between the two.

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:00.540
These results were interesting because Tsimane’
children learn to count at varying ages, and

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.890
they saw that how these children bestowed
a reward and did not correlate with age as

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.300
in previous studies. The researchers propose
that children may understand the concept of

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.660
rewarding greater efforts before they learn
to count, but they can't accurately translate

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:18.110
that understanding into an appropriate distribution
because they can’t yet represent quantity

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:19.750
with numeric values.

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:21.910
So is “fair” ever “equal”?

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:26.550
Ideas of “fair” and equal are present,
not just in humans, but in primates too. A

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:31.099
now famous study done in monkeys by Sarah
Brosnan and Frans de Waal shows that when

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:35.830
two monkeys, in full view of each other, are
asked to perform an identical task but receive

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:41.170
unequal rewards the monkey who receives the
lowest reward reacts strongly and violently

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:44.510
to the inequality as, well, any one of us
would!

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:48.790
So what does this intrinsic understanding
of equality mean in our unequal society?

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:54.110
Economists Michael Norton and Dan Ariely published
results of an experimental survey in 2011

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:58.890
that shows Americans greatly underestimate
the level of inequality extant in our own

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:04.000
society and when asked, we even say we would
like a much more equal distribution of societal

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.659
wealth than both what we have and what we
think we have.

00:03:07.659 --> 00:03:12.040
However, when Norton and Ariely asked their
experimental subjects to design the wealth

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:16.349
distribution of a society that the subjects
would be willing to enter at any hierarchical

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:20.920
level, the participants did *not* create a
society that was mathematically equal across

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:26.159
all class designations. Implying, that even
when tasked with creating a fair and equal

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:31.590
social structure, we’d still like the possibility
of getting just a little bit more than everyone

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:32.590
else.

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:37.170
Sometimes, life just isn't fair. one place
where unfairness runs wild is in sports!
