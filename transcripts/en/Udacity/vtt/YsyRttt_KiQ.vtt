Of course it smells like strawberries and dish soap. Now we've been through

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:08.570
the first two steps, and we've got a nice solution that's mixed up,

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:12.850
mashed pretty well, digestive protein. We need to move to our third step,

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:16.748
which is where we filter out all the unwanted chunks of strawberry that are

00:00:16.748 --> 00:00:17.305
[SOUND]

00:00:17.305 --> 00:00:20.160
left over. And this is when we're actually going to use our coffee

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.210
filters and second glass. So what you can see here, is I'm

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:29.650
going to take two coffee filters, mainly because one just isn't quite enough.

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:33.915
I'm going to place it inside the cup here. And then I'm going to take

00:00:33.915 --> 00:00:34.980
[SOUND]

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.170
my strawberry mixture and I'm going to pour it

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.020
right here in the middle. Just like that.

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:49.770
Now I'm going to grab the coffee filters by both sides, and I'm just going

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:57.060
to lift up, and you'll see that

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:01.530
it's filtering through. This is liquid that contains

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.540
the salty DNA that's dissolved in it.

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:06.970
And all those big strawberry chunks are left

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:12.320
in the coffee filter. So I can squeeze the filter just a little bit, and

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.850
get even more out. Okay. Once you have

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:20.094
enough of this pink salty DNA strawberry liquid.

00:01:20.094 --> 00:01:25.210
Then you're ready to go on to the next, and forth step, where we precipitate the

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:27.495
DNA, with alcohol. So I'm going to go to

00:01:27.495 --> 00:01:29.900
the freezer, I'm going to get out our rubbing

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:30.225
[NOISE]

00:01:30.225 --> 00:01:33.240
alcohol that we put in there so it's, nice and cold.
