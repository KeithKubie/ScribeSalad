that as you go out in a car you drive
 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:18.470
that as you go out in a car you drive
the entire road network and you take a

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480
the entire road network and you take a
 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:19.939
the entire road network and you take a
look at it there could be cracks there

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949
look at it there could be cracks there
 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:21.830

what robotics does is we use a

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849
what robotics does is we use a
 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:28.880
what robotics does is we use a
smartphone and AI

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890
smartphone and AI
 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.890
smartphone and AI
and we can go out and we can take video

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900
and we can go out and we can take video
 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.380
and we can go out and we can take video
data in that same pattern that then gets

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390
data in that same pattern that then gets
 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.120
data in that same pattern that then gets
uploaded into our cloud systems where we

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130
uploaded into our cloud systems where we
 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.190
uploaded into our cloud systems where we
can process that data looking for the

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200
can process that data looking for the
 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.619
can process that data looking for the
same de-stresses except now it's a

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629
same de-stresses except now it's a
 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.690
same de-stresses except now it's a
machine that's doing it that's creating

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700
machine that's doing it that's creating
 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.819
machine that's doing it that's creating
an objective profile of your entire road

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829

budget where should they put those

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629
budget where should they put those
 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.450

resources should it be on that road or

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460
resources should it be on that road or
 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.729

that road robotics is sort of a small

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739

menial work you can do it systematically

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:10.790
menial work you can do it systematically
 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:13.760
menial work you can do it systematically
and by that you can increase

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770
and by that you can increase
 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.480
and by that you can increase
transparency in equity the whole idea

started with me getting the small grant

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650
started with me getting the small grant
 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.950
started with me getting the small grant
at CMU as a researcher and so I

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960
at CMU as a researcher and so I
 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.200
at CMU as a researcher and so I
developed my idea there developed the

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210
developed my idea there developed the
 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.359
developed my idea there developed the
algorithm and now to see that it

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369
algorithm and now to see that it
 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.740
algorithm and now to see that it
actually is used in a company and gets

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750
actually is used in a company and gets
 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.660
actually is used in a company and gets
recognition that's really that's really

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670
recognition that's really that's really
 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.090
recognition that's really that's really
great because it's not just that the

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100
great because it's not just that the
 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.969
great because it's not just that the
algorithms worked but it's actually

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:36.979
algorithms worked but it's actually
 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:40.070
