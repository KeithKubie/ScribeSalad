00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:03.990
- [Narrator] This
program is a presentation

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.193
of UCTV for educational and
non commercial use only.

00:00:10.311 --> 00:00:12.811
(happy music)

00:00:43.138 --> 00:00:43.971
- We're gonna start

00:00:43.971 --> 00:00:45.930
by reading a very short story by Borges.

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.270
This is probably not legal

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:49.550
'cause I'm gonna read you the whole story

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:52.393
but the whole story is only
a couple of paragraphs.

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:54.800
Borges and I,

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.813
yeah, I don't know whether
it's fair use or not.

00:00:56.813 --> 00:01:01.813
Borges and I, by Jorge
Luis Borges, 1899 to 1986.

00:01:02.447 --> 00:01:04.579
"The other one, the one called Borges,

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:06.800
"is the one things happen to.

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.067
"I walk through the
streets of Buenos Aires

00:01:09.067 --> 00:01:10.007
"and stop for a moment,

00:01:10.007 --> 00:01:11.617
"perhaps mechanically now

00:01:11.617 --> 00:01:13.427
"to look at the arch of an entrance hall

00:01:13.427 --> 00:01:15.147
"and the grillwork on the gate.

00:01:15.147 --> 00:01:17.007
"I know of Borges from the mail

00:01:17.007 --> 00:01:19.207
"and I see his name on
the list of professors

00:01:19.207 --> 00:01:21.207
"or in a biographical dictionary.

00:01:21.207 --> 00:01:24.427
"I like hourglasses, maps
and 18th century typography,

00:01:24.427 --> 00:01:27.297
"the taste of coffee and
the prose of Stephenson.

00:01:27.297 --> 00:01:29.997
"He shares these preferences
but in a vain way

00:01:29.997 --> 00:01:32.927
"that turns them into the
attributes of an actor.

00:01:32.927 --> 00:01:34.227
"It would be an exaggeration

00:01:34.227 --> 00:01:36.547
"to say that ours is a
hostile relationship.

00:01:36.547 --> 00:01:38.774
"I live, let myself go on living

00:01:38.774 --> 00:01:41.367
"so that Borges may
contrive his literature

00:01:41.367 --> 00:01:43.708
"and his literature justifies me.

00:01:43.708 --> 00:01:45.787
"It is no effort for me to confess

00:01:45.787 --> 00:01:48.077
"that he has achieved some valid pages.

00:01:48.077 --> 00:01:50.047
"But those pages cannot save me

00:01:50.047 --> 00:01:53.537
"because what is good belongs to no one,

00:01:53.537 --> 00:01:54.755
"not even to him

00:01:54.755 --> 00:01:57.697
"but rather to the
language and to tradition.

00:01:57.697 --> 00:02:01.127
"Besides, I am destined
to perish definitively

00:02:01.127 --> 00:02:04.313
"and only some instant of
myself can survive in him.

00:02:05.207 --> 00:02:08.217
"Little by little, I am
giving over everything to him

00:02:08.217 --> 00:02:10.097
"though I am quite aware
of his perverse custom

00:02:10.097 --> 00:02:13.177
"of falsifying and magnifying things.

00:02:13.177 --> 00:02:14.687
"Spinoza knew that all things

00:02:14.687 --> 00:02:16.697
"long to persist in their being,

00:02:16.697 --> 00:02:19.237
"the stone eternally wants to be a stone

00:02:19.237 --> 00:02:21.667
"and the tiger a tiger."

00:02:21.667 --> 00:02:24.780
Why am I laughing at a great
philosopher like Spinoza?

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.517
Well, I don't know.

00:02:26.517 --> 00:02:29.667
"I shall remain in Borges, not in myself

00:02:29.667 --> 00:02:31.867
"if it is true that I am someone.

00:02:31.867 --> 00:02:34.577
"But I recognize myself less in his books

00:02:34.577 --> 00:02:35.607
"than in many others

00:02:35.607 --> 00:02:38.507
"or in the laborious
strumming of a guitar.

00:02:38.507 --> 00:02:40.527
"Years ago I tried to free myself from him

00:02:40.527 --> 00:02:42.697
"and went from the
mythologies of the suburbs

00:02:42.697 --> 00:02:44.847
"to the games with time and infinity.

00:02:44.847 --> 00:02:46.707
"But these games belong to Borges now

00:02:46.707 --> 00:02:48.160
"and I shall have to imagine other things.

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:50.297
"Thus my life is a flight

00:02:50.297 --> 00:02:52.997
"and I lose everything and
everything belongs to oblivion

00:02:52.997 --> 00:02:54.387
"or to him.

00:02:54.387 --> 00:02:57.690
"I do not know which of
us has written this page."

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:00.086
So that's the story.

00:03:00.086 --> 00:03:04.399
Now, Jorge Luis Borges

00:03:04.399 --> 00:03:07.270
is definitely the author
of this short story,

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:08.110
the one who wrote it,

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:10.670
presumably edited it
over a period of time,

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:13.110
published it and who was
similarly responsible

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:15.363
for all the other works we know by Borges.

00:03:16.257 --> 00:03:18.683
I will call him the author.

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:21.740
Then there are two characters in it.

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:25.479
There's the one the author
calls and I will call Borges

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:28.590
and there's the other one
who I will call the writer

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:30.900
and the writer is referred to in the story

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:31.840
in the first person

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:34.683
that is with the word I in
the English translation.

00:03:35.919 --> 00:03:39.110
In the story, the writer
and Borges are presented

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:40.330
as the same person.

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:43.040
The writer is a famous
author named Borges,

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:45.040
although he's curiously alienated

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:46.460
from this aspect of himself

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:49.520
and so writes as if
Borges were someone else.

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:51.240
But the point of the story would be lost

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:53.126
if the writer were not Borges.

00:03:53.126 --> 00:03:55.610
Borges could've written a story like this

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:57.830
about some other author,
real or fictional,

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:59.770
and I suppose a possible interpretation

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:01.090
is that he's doing so,

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:03.870
that the fictional author also
happens to be named Borges

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:06.270
but I don't think it's a very
plausible interpretation.

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:08.950
I'll assume a more
straightforward interpretation.

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:10.150
So we have two identities,

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:12.863
the author is the writer,

00:04:12.863 --> 00:04:14.870
the one referred to as I

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:16.510
and the writer is Borges,

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:18.123
the one referred to with Borges.

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:20.360
In the story,

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:22.980
the writer tells us of a
number of relationships

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:24.090
that he has to Borges

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:27.450
and compares himself to
Borges in various ways.

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:29.550
These relationships are
perfectly reasonable

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:32.010
and familiar ones to have
to people other than oneself

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:34.970
but some of them are a
bit odd to have to oneself

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:37.823
and some of them are
impossible to have to oneself.

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:41.340
So the writer says he knows
of Borges from the mail

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:43.260
and sees his name on a list of professors

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:44.970
or in a biographical dictionary.

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:46.680
There's nothing mysterious

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:48.950
about one person knowing
about another in such ways.

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:52.030
I know of Barack Obama through
seeing him on television

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:54.210
and reading about him in the newspapers.

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:56.070
That's a reasonable and familiar way

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:58.370
to learn about someone else.

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:00.340
How about Barack Obama himself?

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:03.430
Can he know himself through
seeing himself on television

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:05.700
or reading about himself
in the newspapers?

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:07.640
Presumably, he can and does

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:10.210
learn some things about
himself in that way.

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:12.320
He might learn about a
funny expression he makes

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:13.980
by seeing Obama in the evening news.

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:16.280
He might learn what his exact words were

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:17.150
at a press conference

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:18.900
by reading the transcript the next day

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:20.960
in the New York Times.

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:22.110
But the writer makes it sound

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:24.437
as if he is only aware
of Borges' very existence

00:05:24.437 --> 00:05:26.810
through these third person ways

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:28.653
and that would be rather odd.

00:05:29.642 --> 00:05:32.750
It would not only be
odd but quite impossible

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:35.440
for Borges to survive the writer,

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:37.260
even if all that's meant by survival

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.040
is living on as a literary figure.

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:41.440
If Borges lives on in that
way, so will the writer,

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:43.150
they're one in the same person.

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:44.880
Other contradictions are only implied

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:47.918
as if the writer likes
hourglasses, Stephenson

00:05:47.918 --> 00:05:48.751
and the taste of coffee

00:05:48.751 --> 00:05:51.223
in a less vain and artificial
way than Borges does.

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:53.840
In following the writer's thoughts,

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:55.310
we must to a certain extent,

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:57.160
pretend that the writer is not Borges

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:00.560
but if we think of it as just
a story about two people,

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:01.770
one of whom reads about the other,

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:02.960
shares some of his tastes,

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:04.550
finds him pompous and annoying

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:06.100
and yet somehow supports him,

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:07.900
it loses its point.

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:09.020
The interest of the story

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:11.430
is the thoughts that the
writer has about himself,

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:13.140
thoughts that are most naturally expressed

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:14.720
in the forms of words usually reserved

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:16.930
for talking about someone else.

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:18.500
The writer is driven to these words

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:20.980
not only because of some fugue state

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:23.320
in which he has forgotten
that he is Borges

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:26.513
but in order to express a
certain alienation he feels

00:06:26.513 --> 00:06:29.071
about what certain aspects of himself

00:06:29.071 --> 00:06:31.146
and certain achievements of his,

00:06:31.146 --> 00:06:33.120
how he feels about them,

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:34.970
aspects and achievements he can convey

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:36.673
by the use of the name Borges.

00:06:37.803 --> 00:06:41.034
To understand how Borges' words work,

00:06:41.034 --> 00:06:46.018
we need to distinguish
between two kinds of beliefs

00:06:46.018 --> 00:06:48.440
or more generally attitudes.

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:50.110
But I'll say, just two kinds of beliefs

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:52.360
our words can express about ourselves

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:54.580
which I call self belief

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:57.920
and belief about the
person you happen to be.

00:06:57.920 --> 00:06:59.580
Now, to make these distinctions,

00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:01.980
I shift to the second
interesting part of the talk,

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:04.933
an anecdote that Ernst
Mach tells about himself.

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:09.533
So the dean should like
this being a physicist.

00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:15.320
Mach, in the analysis
of sensations early on

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:16.827
tells the following story about himself,

00:07:16.827 --> 00:07:18.720
"Not long ago," he writes,

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:22.297
"after a trying railway journey by night

00:07:22.297 --> 00:07:23.557
"when I was very tired,

00:07:23.557 --> 00:07:25.361
"I got into an omnibus

00:07:25.361 --> 00:07:28.363
"just as another man
appeared at the other end.

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:33.057
"What a shabby pedagogue that
is that has just entered,

00:07:33.057 --> 00:07:34.157
"thought I.

00:07:34.157 --> 00:07:37.600
"It was myself, opposite
me hung a large mirror."

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:39.790
Mirrors they have in buses and cable cars

00:07:39.790 --> 00:07:41.010
so that when they're crowded,

00:07:41.010 --> 00:07:43.607
the conductors can keep track of everyone.

00:07:43.607 --> 00:07:45.657
"The physionomy of my class accordingly

00:07:45.657 --> 00:07:47.507
"was better known to me than my own."

00:07:48.367 --> 00:07:52.110
Now Mach acquired a belief at
the beginning of the episode

00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:54.254
that we can imagine him expressing as

00:07:54.254 --> 00:07:57.763
one, that man is a shabby pedagogue.

00:07:58.770 --> 00:08:01.080
By the end of the episode he has another

00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:03.380
which we can imagine him expressing as,

00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:04.853
I am a shabby pedagogue.

00:08:05.890 --> 00:08:07.420
And just for bookkeeping

00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:09.530
and to make it easier to
compare him with Borges,

00:08:09.530 --> 00:08:11.040
we'll imagine that he went on

00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:12.717
to make an obvious inference and say,

00:08:12.717 --> 00:08:15.190
"Mach is a shabby pedagogue."

00:08:15.190 --> 00:08:17.460
So we've got three ways of expressing

00:08:18.424 --> 00:08:21.272
something that's true if and only if,

00:08:21.272 --> 00:08:23.900
a single person, Mach
is a shabby pedagogue.

00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:26.220
Two expresses self knowledge

00:08:26.220 --> 00:08:27.833
or at least self belief.

00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:31.564
While one and three really don't

00:08:31.564 --> 00:08:34.240
and yet one and three are,

00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:36.030
in a perfectly clear sense,

00:08:36.030 --> 00:08:39.080
a case of Mach knowing
something about himself.

00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:41.310
For example, we think of one as being true

00:08:41.310 --> 00:08:43.820
because Mach implies that he was, in fact,

00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:45.390
a shabby pedagogue.

00:08:45.390 --> 00:08:47.210
If Mach's being a shabby pedagogue

00:08:47.210 --> 00:08:48.930
is what makes one true,

00:08:48.930 --> 00:08:50.450
then one was about Mach

00:08:50.450 --> 00:08:53.360
and expressed a belief about Mach.

00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:55.900
But one is not an
expression of self belief.

00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:58.850
One, remember, is that
man is a shabby pedagogue.

00:08:58.850 --> 00:09:02.010
Self belief would be, I
am a shabby pedagogue.

00:09:02.010 --> 00:09:05.630
Similar remarks apply to three.

00:09:05.630 --> 00:09:07.560
I shall say that three and one express

00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:10.980
beliefs about the person
Mach happens to be

00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:13.113
while two expresses self belief.

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:16.546
To get a bit clearer
about the distinction,

00:09:16.546 --> 00:09:20.470
it would be helpful to elaborate
a little on Mach's case

00:09:20.470 --> 00:09:21.540
and number three.

00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:23.530
Suppose when he gets off the bus,

00:09:23.530 --> 00:09:26.270
Mach trips, falls and hits his head.

00:09:26.270 --> 00:09:28.930
For a day or two, he has amnesia.

00:09:28.930 --> 00:09:32.070
He can't remember his name
or what he does for a living.

00:09:32.070 --> 00:09:33.730
He reads the newspaper the next morning

00:09:33.730 --> 00:09:34.760
and in the gossip column,

00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:36.920
he encounters a story
about a shabby pedagogue

00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:39.187
seen on the bus the day before.

00:09:39.187 --> 00:09:40.657
"Shabby pedagogue turns out

00:09:40.657 --> 00:09:44.054
"to be famous scientist
Ernst Mach," it says.

00:09:44.054 --> 00:09:46.740
So Mach comes to have a belief

00:09:46.740 --> 00:09:48.745
he would express with three

00:09:48.745 --> 00:09:50.640
and that belief was true,

00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:52.350
if and only if, the person referred to

00:09:52.350 --> 00:09:54.310
by the newspaper as Ernst Mach

00:09:54.310 --> 00:09:55.470
is a shabby pedagogue

00:09:55.470 --> 00:09:56.930
and he is that person

00:09:56.930 --> 00:10:00.375
so in a sense, he comes to
have a belief about himself

00:10:00.375 --> 00:10:03.040
but only about the
person he happens to be,

00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:04.120
not really a self belief.

00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:06.110
But of course, ordinarily,

00:10:06.110 --> 00:10:07.990
the beliefs Mach expressed was one

00:10:07.990 --> 00:10:10.470
and expresses the next day with three

00:10:10.470 --> 00:10:12.210
would be integrated
with the sort of belief

00:10:12.210 --> 00:10:15.540
he expressed with two, the I expression,

00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:17.670
the I belief, the self belief.

00:10:17.670 --> 00:10:20.130
Ordinarily, the beliefs
we pick up about ourselves

00:10:20.130 --> 00:10:22.260
by looking in a mirror or
reading something about ourselves

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:23.450
using our own name,

00:10:23.450 --> 00:10:26.540
are quickly added to our
stock of self beliefs

00:10:26.540 --> 00:10:28.930
but the point is this
really amounts to something,

00:10:28.930 --> 00:10:30.093
it's not trivial.

00:10:31.509 --> 00:10:34.070
It amounts to more than
the beliefs in question

00:10:34.070 --> 00:10:35.799
merely being about us.

00:10:35.799 --> 00:10:37.500
We could acquire the beliefs

00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:38.900
without, in the intuitive way,

00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:41.130
realizing that the beliefs we had

00:10:41.130 --> 00:10:43.040
are beliefs about us,

00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:45.409
they wouldn't be self beliefs.

00:10:45.409 --> 00:10:48.250
And I'm claiming that
when we get back to Borges

00:10:48.250 --> 00:10:49.730
this will be a useful distinction

00:10:49.730 --> 00:10:51.290
so I'm gonna say more about it.

00:10:51.290 --> 00:10:54.300
Here's where the boring part sets in.

00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:56.583
For about 20 minutes, if you've got,

00:10:57.797 --> 00:11:00.580
if like my cell phone you
have a little bowling game

00:11:00.580 --> 00:11:01.680
on there or something.

00:11:03.959 --> 00:11:07.283
So this section's called
information games.

00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:10.470
Lets start by thinking

00:11:10.470 --> 00:11:13.110
bout the function of beliefs
and cognitions in general

00:11:13.110 --> 00:11:14.810
and then we'll work our
way back to self beliefs.

00:11:14.810 --> 00:11:16.190
Then we'll work our way back to Mach

00:11:16.190 --> 00:11:18.293
and then we'll work
our way back to Borges.

00:11:19.270 --> 00:11:20.190
It seems pretty clear

00:11:20.190 --> 00:11:22.900
that the reason we
perceive and form beliefs,

00:11:22.900 --> 00:11:26.100
the reason we perceive,
comma and form beliefs

00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:29.243
is to help us guide our actions.

00:11:30.812 --> 00:11:32.390
That is if things to right,

00:11:32.390 --> 00:11:34.200
we pick up information and perception

00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:37.040
that tells us what we have
to do to act successfully.

00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:38.480
I mean, there's a lot of other reasons

00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:39.867
for believing and perceiving

00:11:39.867 --> 00:11:42.328
but one suspects that evolutionarily

00:11:42.328 --> 00:11:44.863
that was an important part of it.

00:11:45.700 --> 00:11:48.260
What counts as success,
of course, in our actions

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:51.965
depends itself on our
beliefs, desires and needs.

00:11:51.965 --> 00:11:55.532
So, for example, a chicken needs seeds

00:11:55.532 --> 00:11:58.568
and similar things to survive

00:11:58.568 --> 00:12:00.680
and if it hasn't had any food for awhile,

00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:02.730
it will be hungry and desire to get some.

00:12:02.730 --> 00:12:05.150
It has eyes that are very
good at spotting seeds

00:12:05.150 --> 00:12:09.130
and the ability to peck at the
spot where it sees the seeds.

00:12:09.130 --> 00:12:10.210
So when it sees a seed,

00:12:10.210 --> 00:12:12.267
it's nervous system changes in a way

00:12:12.267 --> 00:12:14.710
that causes it to peck

00:12:14.710 --> 00:12:16.130
and as a result of this,

00:12:16.130 --> 00:12:18.500
it pecks in a spot where there is a seed

00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:20.870
if things go right and it gets nutrition.

00:12:20.870 --> 00:12:24.820
So information has been
picked up by the chicken

00:12:24.820 --> 00:12:26.380
and guided its perception,

00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:30.670
not in any way that I want
to suggest is too grand

00:12:30.670 --> 00:12:33.771
or resembles human consciousness.

00:12:33.771 --> 00:12:36.240
Certainly, it's the sort of thing

00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:39.932
that could be done by
robots even some years ago.

00:12:39.932 --> 00:12:44.840
But the point is there's a flow
of information into action.

00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:48.336
The action succeeds in the circumstance

00:12:48.336 --> 00:12:51.583
that the perception is
designed to register.

00:12:52.820 --> 00:12:55.330
So this is an example of what
I call an information game.

00:12:55.330 --> 00:12:56.410
In an information game,

00:12:56.410 --> 00:12:57.700
a system gets information

00:12:57.700 --> 00:13:00.100
typically about he world around it

00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:01.670
and then uses that information

00:13:01.670 --> 00:13:03.520
in the sense that it acts in a way

00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:06.430
that will be successful
given the information,

00:13:06.430 --> 00:13:09.577
that is given the truth of
the perception or belief.

00:13:09.577 --> 00:13:12.400
What characterizes
different information games

00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:14.750
is the relations between
the agent and time and place

00:13:14.750 --> 00:13:16.890
where the information is picked up

00:13:16.890 --> 00:13:18.240
and the agent and time and place

00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:19.750
where it is used.

00:13:19.750 --> 00:13:21.130
The chicken's game I call

00:13:21.130 --> 00:13:22.840
the straight through information game,

00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:24.810
the agent, time and place

00:13:24.810 --> 00:13:26.700
are pretty much the same
for pick up and use.

00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:29.823
I will now illustrate the
strengths of information game.

00:13:30.950 --> 00:13:32.800
I see that there's water in the glass

00:13:35.420 --> 00:13:36.253
and I drink it.

00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:39.750
Now if I'd seen there
was water in the glass,

00:13:39.750 --> 00:13:43.030
set it there and ran off
to go to the bathroom

00:13:43.030 --> 00:13:46.550
the way men of my age often
have to do and came back,

00:13:46.550 --> 00:13:48.650
that wouldn't be the straight
through information game

00:13:48.650 --> 00:13:52.220
because I would have to
reidentify it as the same glass.

00:13:52.220 --> 00:13:53.430
Searle might have snuck up

00:13:53.430 --> 00:13:56.050
and replaced the glass of
water with a glass of...

00:13:58.050 --> 00:13:59.510
(laughs)

00:13:59.510 --> 00:14:01.777
Chablis, from his vineyard or something,

00:14:01.777 --> 00:14:04.303
might not notice the difference.

00:14:08.230 --> 00:14:11.333
But people engage in far more
complex information games

00:14:11.333 --> 00:14:14.050
than the straight
through information game.

00:14:14.050 --> 00:14:16.853
Like many animals, including
chickens I suppose,

00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:19.880
we can track moving objects

00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:21.830
and accumulate information about them.

00:14:21.830 --> 00:14:23.130
I'm really not sure, chickens,

00:14:23.130 --> 00:14:27.090
but dogs certainly can.

00:14:27.090 --> 00:14:28.240
But here's a human example.

00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:32.990
A thief watches me take
money from the ATM.

00:14:32.990 --> 00:14:37.113
He picks up the information
that I have cash on me.

00:14:37.990 --> 00:14:40.670
Then he tracks me, looking
for an opportune moment

00:14:40.670 --> 00:14:43.010
to mug me and take the money.

00:14:43.010 --> 00:14:46.294
As he tracks me, he may accumulate
more useful information,

00:14:46.294 --> 00:14:48.290
where I put the money,

00:14:48.290 --> 00:14:51.670
how fast and strong I
seem to be or not be,

00:14:51.670 --> 00:14:53.770
whether I am carrying any weapons.

00:14:53.770 --> 00:14:57.490
He accumulates information
about the object he's tracking

00:14:57.490 --> 00:14:58.720
and when he strikes,

00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:00.980
he uses that accumulation of information

00:15:00.980 --> 00:15:02.159
gotten at different times

00:15:02.159 --> 00:15:05.103
and brings it to bear on how he acts.

00:15:06.724 --> 00:15:11.724
I call a third kind of
information detach and recognize.

00:15:11.780 --> 00:15:14.230
It is of great importance in human life,

00:15:14.230 --> 00:15:16.253
although probably not uniquely human.

00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:19.180
Perhaps rather than tracking me,

00:15:19.180 --> 00:15:20.320
the thief merely notes

00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:22.990
some identifying characteristics about me,

00:15:22.990 --> 00:15:23.823
what I look like,

00:15:23.823 --> 00:15:25.580
what I am wearing.

00:15:25.580 --> 00:15:29.270
Later in the day in a convenient
dark and secluded spot,

00:15:29.270 --> 00:15:32.940
he recognizes me as the person
who took cash from the ATM.

00:15:32.940 --> 00:15:35.020
He infers that since I
had a lot of money then,

00:15:35.020 --> 00:15:37.221
I still have a significant amount now.

00:15:37.221 --> 00:15:41.110
This information motivates his attack.

00:15:41.110 --> 00:15:43.705
So he picks up information
about me at one time,

00:15:43.705 --> 00:15:46.410
he breaks off his perception of me,

00:15:46.410 --> 00:15:48.400
that's what I mean by detach

00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:51.410
and then he later uses some of
the information he picked up

00:15:51.410 --> 00:15:52.858
to recognize me

00:15:52.858 --> 00:15:55.580
and then the other
information he picked up

00:15:55.580 --> 00:15:56.843
to guide his action.

00:15:57.800 --> 00:15:59.990
He recognizes me because of things

00:16:00.900 --> 00:16:02.740
like what I look like

00:16:02.740 --> 00:16:05.823
but what guides his action is
his belief that I have money.

00:16:08.020 --> 00:16:10.890
Finally and even more
characteristically human

00:16:10.890 --> 00:16:13.564
information game, communication.

00:16:13.564 --> 00:16:17.800
The thief sees me walking from
the bank down Hamilton Avenue

00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:18.680
towards my home.

00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:20.930
He phones the confederate
lurking at the corner

00:16:20.930 --> 00:16:22.530
of Hamilton and Guinda

00:16:22.530 --> 00:16:24.020
and tells him what I look like

00:16:24.020 --> 00:16:25.430
and that I am loaded with cash.

00:16:25.430 --> 00:16:28.143
This is kind of a typical
Palo Alto example.

00:16:29.730 --> 00:16:31.263
I know here in Berkeley,

00:16:32.230 --> 00:16:34.430
it seems strange to
worry about such things.

00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:39.690
The confederate waits
until he sees a shabby,

00:16:39.690 --> 00:16:42.571
gray haired, tweed jacketed pedagogue

00:16:42.571 --> 00:16:44.890
and then mugs me.

00:16:44.890 --> 00:16:47.630
Information picked up at
one time by one person

00:16:47.630 --> 00:16:49.730
is applied that is guides the action

00:16:49.730 --> 00:16:52.763
of another person at
another time, communication.

00:16:53.750 --> 00:16:55.450
In all these information games,

00:16:55.450 --> 00:16:59.747
we can distinguish between two roles.

00:16:59.747 --> 00:17:01.845
What I will call the source

00:17:01.845 --> 00:17:05.290
and with apologies to those
who actually know some Latin,

00:17:05.290 --> 00:17:06.730
the (speaking in foreign language)

00:17:06.730 --> 00:17:08.443
of an instance of the game.

00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:13.620
The source is the object
information is picked up about.

00:17:13.620 --> 00:17:15.560
The (speaking in foreign
language) is the object

00:17:15.560 --> 00:17:18.330
the action motivated and
guided by the information

00:17:18.330 --> 00:17:20.220
is directed at.

00:17:20.220 --> 00:17:21.370
In all of these stories,

00:17:21.370 --> 00:17:22.720
I was both the source

00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:24.320
and the (speaking in foreign language).

00:17:24.320 --> 00:17:25.320
I was the object

00:17:25.320 --> 00:17:27.750
the original thief picked
up information about

00:17:27.750 --> 00:17:29.580
and the object that was eventually mugged

00:17:29.580 --> 00:17:31.053
by one thief or the other.

00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:35.780
But clearly things don't always
go as they are supposed to.

00:17:35.780 --> 00:17:38.680
The source isn't always the
(speaking in foreign language).

00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:42.290
Suppose other gray haired
tweed coated shabby pedagogues

00:17:42.290 --> 00:17:44.036
who hadn't been to an ATM

00:17:44.036 --> 00:17:46.581
and is in fact quite penniless

00:17:46.581 --> 00:17:49.660
makes it to the corner of
Guinda and Hamilton before I do.

00:17:49.660 --> 00:17:51.500
The second thief may mug this fellow

00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:53.180
and come up penniless.

00:17:53.180 --> 00:17:54.820
In this case, I was the source,

00:17:54.820 --> 00:17:55.653
the other poor fellow

00:17:55.653 --> 00:17:57.010
was the (speaking in foreign language).

00:17:57.010 --> 00:17:59.260
The detach and recognize information game

00:17:59.260 --> 00:18:00.330
are detached beliefs,

00:18:00.330 --> 00:18:03.870
the ones not tied to any
perception have two duties.

00:18:03.870 --> 00:18:06.590
They must allow us to
recognize the source,

00:18:06.590 --> 00:18:07.800
that is ensure that the source

00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:09.181
is the (speaking in foreign language)

00:18:09.181 --> 00:18:12.240
and provide information about the source

00:18:13.626 --> 00:18:16.223
that will motivate action like mugging.

00:18:17.270 --> 00:18:18.720
The thug sees what I look like

00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:20.060
which will aid in recognition,

00:18:20.060 --> 00:18:21.160
sees that I have cash

00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:22.540
which provides motive for doing something

00:18:22.540 --> 00:18:24.723
but of course, either can go wrong.

00:18:26.270 --> 00:18:27.143
Okay.

00:18:35.670 --> 00:18:38.510
Notions, next section's called notions,

00:18:38.510 --> 00:18:39.983
files and buffers.

00:18:41.540 --> 00:18:44.900
Embedded deeply in folk
psychology and cognitive science

00:18:44.900 --> 00:18:47.050
is the idea that our
beliefs, desires and the like

00:18:47.050 --> 00:18:48.290
have a structure,

00:18:48.290 --> 00:18:50.105
that we have ideas

00:18:50.105 --> 00:18:54.010
that are somehow involved in
many different cognitions.

00:18:54.010 --> 00:18:55.640
I have beliefs about Stanford,

00:18:55.640 --> 00:18:57.564
desires involving Stanford,

00:18:57.564 --> 00:18:59.490
conjectures about Stanford,

00:18:59.490 --> 00:19:01.380
emotions that concern Stanford.

00:19:01.380 --> 00:19:04.685
My idea of Stanford is a
common element of all of those.

00:19:04.685 --> 00:19:07.110
Similarly, I believe that
Harvard is a university,

00:19:07.110 --> 00:19:08.380
Princeton is a university,

00:19:08.380 --> 00:19:10.120
MIT is a university,

00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:11.740
and the University of
California - Berkeley

00:19:11.740 --> 00:19:13.820
remains the greatest
university in the world

00:19:13.820 --> 00:19:15.460
in spite of the very sorry state

00:19:15.460 --> 00:19:18.580
of California's budget and so on.

00:19:18.580 --> 00:19:20.950
My idea of the property
of being a university

00:19:20.950 --> 00:19:23.330
is a common element in all of these.

00:19:23.330 --> 00:19:25.210
My belief that Stanford is a university

00:19:25.210 --> 00:19:26.043
has a structure,

00:19:26.043 --> 00:19:27.500
it involves these two ideas,

00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:29.830
of Stanford and of a university.

00:19:29.830 --> 00:19:31.010
For my purposes today,

00:19:31.010 --> 00:19:33.295
a rather crude taxonomy
of ideas will suffice.

00:19:33.295 --> 00:19:34.802
I distinguish between notions,

00:19:34.802 --> 00:19:38.848
ideas of things like Stanford

00:19:38.848 --> 00:19:41.180
and ideas of properties and relations

00:19:41.180 --> 00:19:42.973
which I just call ideas

00:19:42.973 --> 00:19:45.420
like my idea of a university.

00:19:45.420 --> 00:19:47.110
And among notions, I'll distinguish,

00:19:47.110 --> 00:19:48.340
and this is the important thing,

00:19:48.340 --> 00:19:50.870
between buffers and files.

00:19:50.870 --> 00:19:53.300
A belief involves notions being associated

00:19:53.300 --> 00:19:56.400
with various ideas and other notions.

00:19:56.400 --> 00:19:58.190
So the basic picture is this,

00:19:58.190 --> 00:19:59.670
our beliefs and other cognitions

00:19:59.670 --> 00:20:02.190
provide us with two connected databases

00:20:03.479 --> 00:20:07.290
which correspond to the
attached and detached

00:20:07.290 --> 00:20:12.220
distinction alluded to in the
phrase detach and recognize.

00:20:12.220 --> 00:20:14.730
Buffers are basically perceptual.

00:20:14.730 --> 00:20:17.670
They are attached to perceptions,

00:20:17.670 --> 00:20:20.693
to ways of knowing about
the object in question.

00:20:21.667 --> 00:20:24.200
They are of the objects we are perceiving

00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:26.096
or at least tracking,

00:20:26.096 --> 00:20:27.830
the objects in our hand,

00:20:27.830 --> 00:20:28.800
the objects we see,

00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:31.510
maybe the people we're
talking to on the phone,

00:20:31.510 --> 00:20:33.180
the one we're getting perceptual

00:20:33.180 --> 00:20:36.010
information and input about

00:20:36.010 --> 00:20:37.793
and are in that sense attached to.

00:20:40.352 --> 00:20:43.600
Files are notions we have of objects

00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:45.680
that are independent of
any perceptual relations

00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:47.460
they may have to us at the moment.

00:20:47.460 --> 00:20:48.830
As we navigate around the world,

00:20:48.830 --> 00:20:50.690
we are constantly filling up buffers

00:20:50.690 --> 00:20:53.420
with information about
objects we perceive,

00:20:53.420 --> 00:20:54.770
objects we see and hear,

00:20:54.770 --> 00:20:57.870
things we pick up and handle and so forth.

00:20:57.870 --> 00:20:59.880
A second database involves files

00:20:59.880 --> 00:21:03.096
as a result of previous
encounters now detached.

00:21:03.096 --> 00:21:05.420
Links are made between the databases

00:21:05.420 --> 00:21:06.880
as we recognize the objects

00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:08.410
of which we've formed buffers,

00:21:08.410 --> 00:21:11.230
of the very objects of
which we have notions.

00:21:11.230 --> 00:21:13.330
Excuse me, as we recognize the objects

00:21:13.330 --> 00:21:14.930
of which we have formed buffers

00:21:14.930 --> 00:21:17.730
as the very objects of
which we already had notions

00:21:17.730 --> 00:21:19.970
or mistakenly think we do.

00:21:19.970 --> 00:21:21.530
Here's a striking individual,

00:21:21.530 --> 00:21:22.640
an intelligent face,

00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:23.990
a kind demeanor,

00:21:23.990 --> 00:21:25.440
a strong athlete build.

00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:26.840
Who could it be?

00:21:26.840 --> 00:21:29.633
Sean Connery, John Searle?

00:21:30.781 --> 00:21:34.060
But what would Sean Connery
be doing at my talk?

00:21:34.060 --> 00:21:35.700
It must be Searle.

00:21:35.700 --> 00:21:37.240
So I have this buffer,

00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:39.430
the perceptual information goes in.

00:21:39.430 --> 00:21:40.710
After awhile, I sort it out

00:21:40.710 --> 00:21:42.170
and attach it to one of my files.

00:21:42.170 --> 00:21:45.710
I had a file of John
Searle for I don't know,

00:21:45.710 --> 00:21:48.560
since about 1966

00:21:48.560 --> 00:21:51.440
when he first read an article by him.

00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:54.481
He was probably only 40 or 50 then.

00:21:54.481 --> 00:21:56.510
(audience laughs)

00:21:56.510 --> 00:21:59.373
Where is John to see how
irritated he's getting.

00:21:59.373 --> 00:22:00.706
Oh, there he is.

00:22:02.076 --> 00:22:04.490
That's the picture, notions and files,

00:22:04.490 --> 00:22:06.052
my head's full of files

00:22:06.052 --> 00:22:09.230
and when I go to a new
place or a familiar place,

00:22:09.230 --> 00:22:11.470
I'm constant reattaching the files,

00:22:11.470 --> 00:22:12.860
that's how life works

00:22:12.860 --> 00:22:15.326
and that allows me to bring all the,

00:22:15.326 --> 00:22:17.347
when I saw Searle today I said,

00:22:17.347 --> 00:22:19.250
"Hi John."

00:22:19.250 --> 00:22:20.083
Why?

00:22:20.083 --> 00:22:20.916
'Cause I knew his name.

00:22:20.916 --> 00:22:21.749
How'd I know his name?

00:22:24.250 --> 00:22:27.090
In a better world, we'd just
all have our names right here

00:22:27.090 --> 00:22:29.760
but here I have to remember his name,

00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:33.100
that is I have to take the detached file

00:22:33.100 --> 00:22:35.240
and get it hooked up
with my perceptual buffer

00:22:35.240 --> 00:22:36.610
which is also my action buffer.

00:22:36.610 --> 00:22:40.193
I know how to say to
someone that I see, hi John.

00:22:44.069 --> 00:22:45.730
I'm gonna shift to another friend of mine

00:22:45.730 --> 00:22:46.680
named David Israel,

00:22:46.680 --> 00:22:48.380
some of you know him

00:22:48.380 --> 00:22:50.235
just because that's,

00:22:50.235 --> 00:22:52.970
I have some examples worked out

00:22:52.970 --> 00:22:54.280
with regard to David Israel

00:22:54.280 --> 00:22:56.760
who doesn't seem to have
shown up at the talk,

00:22:56.760 --> 00:22:57.610
for goodness sakes

00:22:57.610 --> 00:23:00.623
even though Berkeley is his alma mater.

00:23:02.404 --> 00:23:05.760
So I know a lot about Israel.

00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:07.160
I see Israel on the street.

00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:08.799
I say, "Hi David."

00:23:08.799 --> 00:23:11.230
I know he used to be obsessed with lists,

00:23:11.230 --> 00:23:12.650
he's going to Washington, DC,

00:23:12.650 --> 00:23:14.440
hob nobbing with the big wigs,

00:23:14.440 --> 00:23:16.410
listening to Dick Cheney
remember the old days

00:23:16.410 --> 00:23:17.750
when he was Secretary of Defense

00:23:17.750 --> 00:23:19.950
and Al Gore was inventing the internet.

00:23:19.950 --> 00:23:22.290
So this is a paragraph I wrote awhile ago.

00:23:22.290 --> 00:23:26.030
Information is kind of
piped up from my buffer

00:23:26.030 --> 00:23:26.870
to my notion

00:23:26.870 --> 00:23:29.590
and from my notion piped down to my buffer

00:23:29.590 --> 00:23:31.170
or downloaded or uploaded,

00:23:31.170 --> 00:23:32.433
whatever you want to say.

00:23:38.164 --> 00:23:39.360
One final piece of information,

00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:42.940
now Searle is now occupying
what I call an epistemic role

00:23:42.940 --> 00:23:43.773
in my life,

00:23:43.773 --> 00:23:45.580
I know that thrills him.

00:23:45.580 --> 00:23:47.600
That is I am actually seeing him

00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:50.937
which is a way you can pick
up information about people.

00:23:50.937 --> 00:23:53.510
Not a lot at this distance

00:23:53.510 --> 00:23:56.670
but I can see he's even older and grayer

00:23:56.670 --> 00:23:57.920
than last time I saw him.

00:24:00.470 --> 00:24:01.780
He's in front of me.

00:24:01.780 --> 00:24:04.230
Being in front of is a relation

00:24:04.230 --> 00:24:09.230
that is an epistemically
information providing relation.

00:24:11.242 --> 00:24:14.020
It's also a pragmatic relation,

00:24:14.020 --> 00:24:16.650
that is I could take action on Searle

00:24:16.650 --> 00:24:17.520
if I wanted to.

00:24:17.520 --> 00:24:20.220
I could run over and
kiss him on the forehead,

00:24:20.220 --> 00:24:22.600
I don't particularly intend to do that

00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:23.433
but I could do that,

00:24:23.433 --> 00:24:24.266
there is a way of doing that.

00:24:24.266 --> 00:24:25.940
Now David Kaplan,

00:24:25.940 --> 00:24:27.240
who I don't think is in the audience,

00:24:27.240 --> 00:24:30.075
he's not in an epistemic
pragmatic relation to me.

00:24:30.075 --> 00:24:32.580
I might desire to kiss David
on the forehead right now

00:24:32.580 --> 00:24:33.560
more than anything in the world,

00:24:33.560 --> 00:24:34.930
I can't do anything about it.

00:24:34.930 --> 00:24:36.687
There's no way to just,

00:24:36.687 --> 00:24:38.440
from anywhere in the world

00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:39.870
kiss David Kaplan on the forehead.

00:24:39.870 --> 00:24:41.740
You have to be in a pragmatic relation,

00:24:41.740 --> 00:24:44.113
a relation of kissing on the forehead.

00:24:47.190 --> 00:24:48.700
So an epistemic role

00:24:48.700 --> 00:24:51.360
is one such that when an
object placed in my life,

00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:52.953
there's a way of picking up information

00:24:52.953 --> 00:24:54.062
bout that object.

00:24:54.062 --> 00:24:56.510
I I can find out more about
the person in front of me

00:24:56.510 --> 00:24:58.240
by looking at him or her.

00:24:58.240 --> 00:25:00.320
I can find out more about
the person I'm talking to

00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:01.470
by asking them questions.

00:25:01.470 --> 00:25:04.060
I can find out more about
the object I'm handling

00:25:04.060 --> 00:25:06.640
by holding it up where I
can see it and so forth.

00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:08.920
A pragmatic role is one such that

00:25:08.920 --> 00:25:10.880
when an object plays it in my life

00:25:10.880 --> 00:25:12.540
I can do things with it or to it.

00:25:12.540 --> 00:25:14.960
I can throw the object I'm holding.

00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:16.500
I can hit the person in front of me

00:25:16.500 --> 00:25:17.540
or shake hands with him

00:25:17.540 --> 00:25:18.373
or startle him

00:25:18.373 --> 00:25:19.500
by doing something unexpected

00:25:19.500 --> 00:25:21.690
like kissing them on the forehead.

00:25:21.690 --> 00:25:23.100
Suppose that for some time,

00:25:23.100 --> 00:25:27.600
I've wanted to find out the
color of John Searle's eyes.

00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:29.850
I have a notion of John Searle.

00:25:29.850 --> 00:25:31.530
This means he plays a role in my life.

00:25:31.530 --> 00:25:33.490
He's an object at some point perceived

00:25:33.490 --> 00:25:34.720
or otherwise gained information.

00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:36.620
I've formed a notion of him.

00:25:36.620 --> 00:25:37.970
But that role at present,

00:25:37.970 --> 00:25:39.880
that role, just being
someone I have a file of

00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:41.810
isn't epistemic or pragmatic.

00:25:41.810 --> 00:25:43.530
Then here's a person in front of me.

00:25:43.530 --> 00:25:45.860
Some insinuated visa vie me

00:25:45.860 --> 00:25:48.058
that I can find out the color of his eyes

00:25:48.058 --> 00:25:51.010
and tell him how much
I admire intentionality

00:25:51.010 --> 00:25:52.150
even after all these years.

00:25:52.150 --> 00:25:55.310
But of course, even if he is John Searle

00:25:55.310 --> 00:25:56.534
I won't do these things

00:25:56.534 --> 00:25:58.610
if I don't recognize him,

00:25:58.610 --> 00:26:01.623
if I continue to think that
it's Sean Connery instead.

00:26:02.550 --> 00:26:05.020
In a way, and this is an important point,

00:26:05.020 --> 00:26:07.990
detached knowledge is inevitably partial.

00:26:07.990 --> 00:26:10.280
It's an important point
because detached knowledge

00:26:10.280 --> 00:26:13.280
seems to have become the
philosophical ideal of knowledge

00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:16.320
but it shouldn't be because it's partial.

00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:18.930
The view from nowhere is a partial view.

00:26:18.930 --> 00:26:21.120
It's not a deeper, more profound view

00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:23.470
than the view from somewhere.

00:26:23.470 --> 00:26:26.290
In a way, detached knowledge
is inevitably partial.

00:26:26.290 --> 00:26:28.240
It doesn't afford any action.

00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:30.510
By itself, it is of no help to us at all,

00:26:30.510 --> 00:26:32.463
at least in any very practical way.

00:26:33.302 --> 00:26:35.280
If I have a notion of David Israel,

00:26:35.280 --> 00:26:36.113
I can think of him.

00:26:36.113 --> 00:26:37.870
Maybe I can enjoy making up scenarios

00:26:37.870 --> 00:26:39.070
in which he figures.

00:26:39.070 --> 00:26:41.620
Imagine David Israel explaining
the structure of lists

00:26:41.620 --> 00:26:43.780
to George Bush, for example.

00:26:43.780 --> 00:26:45.683
But I wrote a short play about that.

00:26:46.572 --> 00:26:48.740
But nothing very practical.

00:26:48.740 --> 00:26:50.280
To do something to David Israel

00:26:50.280 --> 00:26:51.310
or with David Israel,

00:26:51.310 --> 00:26:52.650
you have to get into some relevant

00:26:52.650 --> 00:26:55.030
epistemic, pragmatic
relationship with him.

00:26:55.030 --> 00:26:56.470
The utility of detached knowledge

00:26:56.470 --> 00:26:58.530
is in its potential to augment

00:26:58.530 --> 00:27:01.020
the knowledge and object we are perceiving

00:27:01.020 --> 00:27:04.290
or at least in a position to act on has.

00:27:04.290 --> 00:27:07.670
Related to this is the
concept of know how.

00:27:07.670 --> 00:27:09.820
We know how to do things involving objects

00:27:09.820 --> 00:27:12.620
to achieve effects conditional
on what the objects are like.

00:27:12.620 --> 00:27:15.030
I know how to shake hands
or startle or irritate

00:27:15.030 --> 00:27:17.100
or find out more about
the object in front of me

00:27:17.100 --> 00:27:19.080
or to my right or in the next room.

00:27:19.080 --> 00:27:20.830
I know a lot about David Kaplan

00:27:20.830 --> 00:27:22.640
but I don't know how
to shake hands with him

00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:24.560
or startle him or irritate him

00:27:24.560 --> 00:27:27.640
except in so far as I
get into some epistemic

00:27:27.640 --> 00:27:29.810
pragmatic relation with him,

00:27:29.810 --> 00:27:31.976
that is I know how to
shake hands with people

00:27:31.976 --> 00:27:34.567
who play a certain role in my life

00:27:34.567 --> 00:27:36.790
as opposed to knowing how to shake hands

00:27:36.790 --> 00:27:38.120
with people per se

00:27:38.120 --> 00:27:39.922
or (speaking in foreign language)

00:27:39.922 --> 00:27:41.820
or whatever the right phrase is.

00:27:41.820 --> 00:27:42.653
Okay.

00:27:42.653 --> 00:27:46.320
Now we're headed back to
our targets, self belief.

00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:47.420
With all this in mind,

00:27:47.420 --> 00:27:49.390
let's return to Mach.

00:27:49.390 --> 00:27:50.810
The first thing to observe

00:27:50.810 --> 00:27:53.750
is that Mach does play
a very important role

00:27:53.750 --> 00:27:55.520
in his own life.

00:27:55.520 --> 00:27:58.370
The role we call self.

00:27:58.370 --> 00:28:00.050
Ones neighbor is the person

00:28:00.050 --> 00:28:02.890
who stands in the relation
living next door to one.

00:28:02.890 --> 00:28:04.850
Ones mother is the person who stands

00:28:04.850 --> 00:28:07.740
in the relation of
female parent of to one.

00:28:07.740 --> 00:28:09.470
These are important roles

00:28:09.470 --> 00:28:11.790
but ones self is the person

00:28:11.790 --> 00:28:13.190
who stands in the relation

00:28:13.190 --> 00:28:15.580
being identical with to one

00:28:15.580 --> 00:28:17.913
and it's an even more important role.

00:28:18.970 --> 00:28:23.010
Identity is an epistemic
and pragmatic relation.

00:28:23.010 --> 00:28:25.320
There are certain ways of
knowing about the person

00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:26.580
who is ones self

00:28:26.580 --> 00:28:29.200
that don't work for anyone else.

00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:31.120
There are certain ways of doing things

00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:32.450
to and with yourself

00:28:32.450 --> 00:28:34.639
that don't work for anyone else.

00:28:34.639 --> 00:28:36.220
There is a way of finding out

00:28:36.220 --> 00:28:37.630
if ones vest is linty

00:28:37.630 --> 00:28:38.930
that each person can use

00:28:38.930 --> 00:28:40.190
to find out about themselves

00:28:40.190 --> 00:28:42.390
that doesn't work for anyone else.

00:28:42.390 --> 00:28:43.660
When he gets to number two

00:28:43.660 --> 00:28:46.058
and says, "Ah, I am the shabby pedagogue,"

00:28:46.058 --> 00:28:49.600
he turns his head down
and he says, "My God."

00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:51.650
Then there is a way of
getting lint off yourself

00:28:51.650 --> 00:28:54.320
that doesn't work with anyone else,

00:28:54.320 --> 00:28:56.303
particularly, well nevermind.

00:28:57.303 --> 00:29:00.240
As university employees

00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:02.180
we've all gone through
sexual harassment training

00:29:02.180 --> 00:29:03.689
and we know you just can't go around

00:29:03.689 --> 00:29:06.713
doing that to other people with impunity,

00:29:07.607 --> 00:29:11.283
even if they're very, very linty.

00:29:16.137 --> 00:29:21.137
Methods for finding out whether
a person has a property,

00:29:21.770 --> 00:29:23.290
I mean some methods for finding out

00:29:23.290 --> 00:29:24.560
whether a person has a property

00:29:24.560 --> 00:29:27.110
are what I call normally self informative.

00:29:27.110 --> 00:29:29.340
That is, normally if you find out a person

00:29:29.340 --> 00:29:30.900
has a property using that method

00:29:30.900 --> 00:29:33.870
the person you're finding
out about is yourself.

00:29:33.870 --> 00:29:36.530
Just as normally if you find out a person

00:29:36.530 --> 00:29:38.640
by opening your eyes while
looking straight ahead,

00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:39.950
the person you're finding out about

00:29:39.950 --> 00:29:41.450
is the person in front of you.

00:29:43.715 --> 00:29:46.690
The method we imagine Mach using

00:29:46.690 --> 00:29:48.921
to see if there's lint
on his vest is like this.

00:29:48.921 --> 00:29:51.940
Philosophers can invent examples

00:29:51.940 --> 00:29:54.760
where the person whose
vest he sees in his way

00:29:54.760 --> 00:29:56.380
is not himself.

00:29:56.380 --> 00:29:58.330
Perhaps his eyes have been unknown to him

00:29:58.330 --> 00:30:00.320
remounted at the top of his head.

00:30:00.320 --> 00:30:01.590
So that when he bends down

00:30:01.590 --> 00:30:03.820
he sees the vest of the
person in front of him

00:30:03.820 --> 00:30:04.853
instead of his own.

00:30:07.860 --> 00:30:10.300
And so finds out in the
way one normally finds out

00:30:10.300 --> 00:30:11.940
about the lintiness of ones own vest

00:30:11.940 --> 00:30:14.700
that that persons vent is linty.

00:30:14.700 --> 00:30:17.270
Arguably, some methods
are not just normally

00:30:17.270 --> 00:30:19.960
but necessarily self informative.

00:30:19.960 --> 00:30:23.090
As ones method for finding
out ones own desires

00:30:23.090 --> 00:30:24.410
or whether one is in pain

00:30:24.410 --> 00:30:26.860
or whether one likes the
taste of a certain wine.

00:30:28.030 --> 00:30:30.390
Now my suggestion about
self belief is this.

00:30:30.390 --> 00:30:33.950
We each have what I call a self buffer.

00:30:33.950 --> 00:30:36.120
This is the repository of information

00:30:36.120 --> 00:30:38.390
picked up in normally informative ways

00:30:38.390 --> 00:30:40.470
and it is also the motivator of actions

00:30:40.470 --> 00:30:42.010
done in normally self effecting

00:30:42.010 --> 00:30:44.070
or self involving ways.

00:30:44.070 --> 00:30:47.835
Self belief is belief
involving these buffers

00:30:47.835 --> 00:30:51.283
which we can call self notions.

00:30:54.103 --> 00:30:58.130
If I was trying to give
an analysis of self belief

00:30:58.130 --> 00:31:02.150
instead of merely make the distinction

00:31:02.150 --> 00:31:03.890
to work back to Borges,

00:31:03.890 --> 00:31:06.370
I would bring in a third
kind of self knowledge

00:31:06.370 --> 00:31:07.610
we call primitive self knowledge

00:31:07.610 --> 00:31:09.421
which doesn't involve any notion at all

00:31:09.421 --> 00:31:11.533
but I won't.

00:31:13.170 --> 00:31:15.713
Just in case you were nervous about that.

00:31:15.713 --> 00:31:17.160
On the other hand,

00:31:17.160 --> 00:31:20.300
we have files of ourself too.

00:31:20.300 --> 00:31:22.010
Suppose the day Mach got on the bus

00:31:22.010 --> 00:31:23.440
was his first day of classes.

00:31:23.440 --> 00:31:25.560
Earlier in the day he
looked at the time schedule

00:31:25.560 --> 00:31:28.050
to see when his introductory
physics course met

00:31:28.050 --> 00:31:29.520
and in what lecture hall.

00:31:29.520 --> 00:31:31.520
He looks for his name in the same way

00:31:31.520 --> 00:31:33.230
he might look for someone else's name

00:31:33.230 --> 00:31:35.080
if he wanted to attend their lecture.

00:31:35.930 --> 00:31:37.730
I say a lecture by a colleague or visitor

00:31:37.730 --> 00:31:40.240
or in the same way that someone
else might look for his name

00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:42.200
to get to his class on time.

00:31:42.200 --> 00:31:43.670
When he sees that he has been assigned

00:31:43.670 --> 00:31:45.350
to teach a course that meets at 11 AM

00:31:45.350 --> 00:31:46.280
in lecture hall seven,

00:31:46.280 --> 00:31:49.250
he picks up information about himself

00:31:49.250 --> 00:31:51.150
in the same way he would
pick up information

00:31:51.150 --> 00:31:52.773
about anyone else.

00:31:54.151 --> 00:31:57.132
Or suppose I need to
call my own cell phone

00:31:57.132 --> 00:31:58.673
'cause I've misplaced it

00:31:58.673 --> 00:32:01.923
and I want it to ring so I can find it.

00:32:02.810 --> 00:32:04.723
Total hypothetical example.

00:32:05.564 --> 00:32:07.920
I don't remember my number

00:32:07.920 --> 00:32:10.040
so I look in my wife's address book

00:32:10.040 --> 00:32:11.790
that has my cell phone number in it.

00:32:11.790 --> 00:32:13.720
I find out about my own cell phone number

00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:14.680
in the same way I'd find out

00:32:14.680 --> 00:32:16.660
somebody else's cell phone number.

00:32:16.660 --> 00:32:17.850
In these sorts of cases,

00:32:17.850 --> 00:32:20.980
there is no use of normally
self informative methods,

00:32:20.980 --> 00:32:23.960
even though we're finding
out about ourselves.

00:32:23.960 --> 00:32:26.090
We find out information about ourselves

00:32:26.090 --> 00:32:28.790
in this same way we find out
information about others.

00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:32.330
When Mach saw what time his class met,

00:32:32.330 --> 00:32:34.360
the belief he picked up was about Mach,

00:32:34.360 --> 00:32:36.460
the person he happens to be.

00:32:36.460 --> 00:32:38.410
It will be integrated with his self notion

00:32:38.410 --> 00:32:39.870
with all the information he picks up

00:32:39.870 --> 00:32:42.643
about himself in normally
self informative ways.

00:32:43.550 --> 00:32:46.583
This is good because
this information has to

00:32:48.068 --> 00:32:53.068
motivate him to use normally
self motivated actions

00:32:53.880 --> 00:32:55.963
like walking to get to the class.

00:32:59.846 --> 00:33:02.270
This is what didn't happen the next day

00:33:02.270 --> 00:33:03.340
when he read the paper

00:33:03.340 --> 00:33:05.620
and learned that the
famous physicist Ernst Mach

00:33:05.620 --> 00:33:06.610
was a shabby pedagogue.

00:33:06.610 --> 00:33:08.010
He acquired a belief.

00:33:08.010 --> 00:33:09.740
The belief was about himself

00:33:09.740 --> 00:33:10.890
but he didn't acquire it

00:33:10.890 --> 00:33:12.950
with the normally self informative method

00:33:12.950 --> 00:33:14.420
and he didn't integrate it

00:33:14.420 --> 00:33:17.190
into that repository for all the beliefs

00:33:17.190 --> 00:33:18.300
acquired in that way

00:33:18.300 --> 00:33:20.500
and therefore it wasn't a self belief

00:33:20.500 --> 00:33:22.990
even though it was a belief about himself,

00:33:22.990 --> 00:33:24.740
about the person he happened to be.

00:33:26.385 --> 00:33:29.540
When he learned that what
time his class met and where,

00:33:29.540 --> 00:33:31.870
Mach had the job of getting
himself to the lecture hall

00:33:31.870 --> 00:33:33.090
at the right time.

00:33:33.090 --> 00:33:34.820
It is essential for this to happen

00:33:34.820 --> 00:33:37.520
that he get this information
into his self notion

00:33:37.520 --> 00:33:39.820
for the information oneself notion

00:33:39.820 --> 00:33:41.920
that guides ones actions.

00:33:41.920 --> 00:33:44.640
Mach knows how to get Mach
someplace by a certain time

00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:46.900
because he knows how to get
himself to a certain place

00:33:46.900 --> 00:33:48.350
by a certain time.

00:33:48.350 --> 00:33:50.960
There is no formula for
getting a certain person,

00:33:50.960 --> 00:33:53.320
Freud or Mach or Wittgenstein say,

00:33:53.320 --> 00:33:55.490
to lecture hall seven at 11 AM.

00:33:55.490 --> 00:33:56.440
What we know how to do

00:33:56.440 --> 00:33:58.423
is to get ourselves to a certain place.

00:34:01.377 --> 00:34:03.276
A place whose role in
our lives we can identify

00:34:03.276 --> 00:34:05.000
the lecture hall upstairs say,

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:07.800
at a time whose role in
our lives we can identify

00:34:07.800 --> 00:34:10.000
an hour from now say.

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:13.450
So far then, excuse me while I,

00:34:19.100 --> 00:34:22.970
so far then, the idea is
that we have self notions

00:34:22.970 --> 00:34:24.440
which are buffers in the sense

00:34:24.440 --> 00:34:26.070
that they're tied to epistemic

00:34:26.070 --> 00:34:27.860
and pragmatic relations

00:34:27.860 --> 00:34:30.030
and a role, the self role,

00:34:30.030 --> 00:34:34.200
that's a certain important
individual plays in our lives.

00:34:34.200 --> 00:34:36.020
And we also have files of ourselves,

00:34:36.020 --> 00:34:37.290
of the person that we happen to be,

00:34:37.290 --> 00:34:39.214
that contain information such as our names

00:34:39.214 --> 00:34:41.620
and possibly our social security numbers,

00:34:41.620 --> 00:34:44.060
telephone numbers, addresses,
office numbers and the like

00:34:44.060 --> 00:34:47.080
that connect with publicly
accessible sources of information

00:34:47.080 --> 00:34:49.120
from which we can gather
information about ourselves

00:34:49.120 --> 00:34:51.703
in the same way that others
gather data about us.

00:34:54.980 --> 00:34:56.010
A brief aside,

00:34:56.010 --> 00:34:57.270
we can also use these files

00:34:57.270 --> 00:34:58.720
to produce effects on ourselves

00:34:58.720 --> 00:35:01.440
in ways that are not
normally self effecting.

00:35:01.440 --> 00:35:03.980
Hume, frustrated with the
reception of his treatise,

00:35:03.980 --> 00:35:07.613
wrote an anonymous and
rather favorable review of it

00:35:07.613 --> 00:35:10.780
hoping the positive review
would have a favorable effect

00:35:10.780 --> 00:35:11.750
on his book

00:35:11.750 --> 00:35:15.390
in the same way of review
of someone else's book

00:35:18.260 --> 00:35:20.940
might favorably affect his fortunes.

00:35:20.940 --> 00:35:23.105
Or perhaps I break into the dean's office,

00:35:23.105 --> 00:35:24.690
sorry about this,

00:35:24.690 --> 00:35:26.987
break into the dean's
office late one night,

00:35:26.987 --> 00:35:28.840
hack into his computer,

00:35:28.840 --> 00:35:29.673
look up my name

00:35:29.673 --> 00:35:32.090
and add a few zeros to my salary

00:35:32.090 --> 00:35:33.900
and then in a fit of altruism

00:35:33.900 --> 00:35:35.650
do the same for Ken Taylor.

00:35:35.650 --> 00:35:39.410
So I affect my own salary
and Taylor's salary

00:35:39.410 --> 00:35:40.433
in the same way.

00:35:41.720 --> 00:35:42.910
But to return to the picture,

00:35:42.910 --> 00:35:45.550
we each have a self notion, a buffer,

00:35:45.550 --> 00:35:47.347
and a file of ourselves

00:35:47.347 --> 00:35:49.110
and clearly they are linked

00:35:49.110 --> 00:35:52.006
or they may just be different
aspects of the same,

00:35:52.006 --> 00:35:54.360
you can think of it as two manila folders

00:35:54.360 --> 00:35:55.720
with a rubber band around them

00:35:55.720 --> 00:35:57.810
or as one manila folder

00:35:57.810 --> 00:36:01.323
that has different kinds
of information in it.

00:36:02.642 --> 00:36:03.990
They're linked.

00:36:03.990 --> 00:36:06.171
Most of us know who we are.

00:36:06.171 --> 00:36:09.647
There are exceptions like
Mach after he bumped his head.

00:36:09.647 --> 00:36:12.987
One might even be wrong about who he is.

00:36:12.987 --> 00:36:15.153
Some people think they are Napoleon.

00:36:17.215 --> 00:36:20.070
I admire John Searle a lot.

00:36:20.070 --> 00:36:22.310
I often fantasize about being him

00:36:22.310 --> 00:36:23.980
and approaching life and philosophy

00:36:23.980 --> 00:36:27.100
with the intelligence, confidence
and energy that he does.

00:36:27.100 --> 00:36:28.973
This is actually sort of true.

00:36:34.176 --> 00:36:35.470
What would it be like

00:36:35.470 --> 00:36:38.373
to have so much confidence
and energy all the time?

00:36:39.800 --> 00:36:40.633
Well anyway,

00:36:41.525 --> 00:36:44.856
now maybe as I slip into senility,

00:36:44.856 --> 00:36:48.290
these fantasies will give way to delusion

00:36:48.290 --> 00:36:51.000
and I'll come to believe I am John Searle

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:53.800
and start showing up for
lectures he's scheduled to give

00:36:54.710 --> 00:36:56.790
or the graduate students
in the Stanford lounge

00:36:56.790 --> 00:36:58.730
will be arguing about whether Searle

00:36:58.730 --> 00:37:01.160
is a closet dualist or not

00:37:01.160 --> 00:37:04.553
and I'll say, "I am not a closet dualist,"

00:37:04.553 --> 00:37:06.243
and explain why.

00:37:08.186 --> 00:37:12.600
But most of us have it
right about who we are

00:37:12.600 --> 00:37:14.520
and herein lies a great difference

00:37:14.520 --> 00:37:17.253
between self notions and other buffers.

00:37:18.368 --> 00:37:22.143
Self notions don't need to be detached.

00:37:23.900 --> 00:37:26.810
I can accumulate information
about the person I'm looking at

00:37:26.810 --> 00:37:28.905
as I track him through the seminar

00:37:28.905 --> 00:37:30.100
or through the party,

00:37:30.100 --> 00:37:32.261
I don't know why I'm tracking
him through a seminar,

00:37:32.261 --> 00:37:35.500
but when I change my
glance or the party ends

00:37:35.500 --> 00:37:37.600
the information my buffer
needs to be detached

00:37:37.600 --> 00:37:40.690
either uploaded into a
preexisting file of the person

00:37:40.690 --> 00:37:41.610
if I recognize her

00:37:41.610 --> 00:37:44.010
or used as a basis for a new file.

00:37:44.010 --> 00:37:45.600
But I don't have to do that

00:37:45.600 --> 00:37:48.770
with my self notion of my John Perry file.

00:37:48.770 --> 00:37:51.180
There's only one person that ever has

00:37:51.180 --> 00:37:54.020
the relation of identity to me.

00:37:54.020 --> 00:37:56.300
There's only one person
I can ever know about

00:37:56.300 --> 00:37:59.290
using those normally
self informative methods.

00:37:59.290 --> 00:38:01.330
There's only one person I can ever act on

00:38:01.330 --> 00:38:03.700
using these normally
self affected methods.

00:38:03.700 --> 00:38:05.730
So if I get it right in the first place,

00:38:05.730 --> 00:38:07.803
it doesn't ever have to change.

00:38:09.300 --> 00:38:10.660
Once you have the connection right,

00:38:10.660 --> 00:38:12.360
it's good for life.

00:38:12.360 --> 00:38:15.940
Now the self notion is not
unique in that respect.

00:38:15.940 --> 00:38:18.380
I have a buffer for the planet I live on,

00:38:18.380 --> 00:38:20.890
the one I find out by looking around.

00:38:20.890 --> 00:38:24.180
So far I've never had
to detach and recognize,

00:38:24.180 --> 00:38:27.203
it's just always the same one, Earth.

00:38:30.439 --> 00:38:33.800
And I have a file for the universe I'm in

00:38:33.800 --> 00:38:36.470
and I've certainly
never had to detach that

00:38:36.470 --> 00:38:41.171
and I have a file for
the possible world I'm in

00:38:41.171 --> 00:38:43.840
and even a name for it, the actual world.

00:38:43.840 --> 00:38:44.673
Ken Taylor says,

00:38:44.673 --> 00:38:47.157
"If anything is immune to error
through a misidentification

00:38:47.157 --> 00:38:49.090
"it's the actual world."

00:38:49.090 --> 00:38:51.470
But we're not interested
in those deep topics,

00:38:51.470 --> 00:38:52.880
we're interested in I.

00:38:52.880 --> 00:38:54.830
Okay, so now we've worked our way

00:38:54.830 --> 00:38:59.084
from Borges to Mach to information games

00:38:59.084 --> 00:39:03.420
to roles and epistemic relations

00:39:03.420 --> 00:39:04.950
and pragmatic relations

00:39:04.950 --> 00:39:07.030
and then back to self notions

00:39:07.030 --> 00:39:10.958
and the identity is an
epistemic and pragmatic relation

00:39:10.958 --> 00:39:15.373
and now we're going back to Borges.

00:39:17.621 --> 00:39:22.621
So remember we've got the writer

00:39:23.829 --> 00:39:25.780
who identifies himself as I.

00:39:25.780 --> 00:39:27.420
We've got Borges,

00:39:27.420 --> 00:39:30.850
that is the person the
writer identifies as Borges

00:39:30.850 --> 00:39:32.990
and then we've got Borges himself

00:39:32.990 --> 00:39:33.823
who wrote the whole thing.

00:39:33.823 --> 00:39:34.720
They're all three the same

00:39:34.720 --> 00:39:37.602
but different ways of thinking of them.

00:39:37.602 --> 00:39:40.070
The writer refers to himself in two ways,

00:39:40.070 --> 00:39:41.700
in the third person and in the first

00:39:41.700 --> 00:39:46.700
with Borges, the name Borges
and with the pronoun I.

00:39:46.860 --> 00:39:48.480
He manages thereby to convey

00:39:48.480 --> 00:39:50.910
somewhat different thoughts to us.

00:39:50.910 --> 00:39:53.330
With Borges, he conveys
thoughts about himself

00:39:53.330 --> 00:39:55.140
tied to his public persona

00:39:55.140 --> 00:39:57.670
and information that
he has or could pick up

00:39:57.670 --> 00:39:59.363
in third person ways.

00:40:00.720 --> 00:40:01.830
With the first person,

00:40:01.830 --> 00:40:03.930
he manages to convey
thoughts about himself

00:40:03.930 --> 00:40:06.000
tied to information he
gets in self informative

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:07.620
or first person ways.

00:40:07.620 --> 00:40:10.600
At least, that's my
hypothesis of what's going on.

00:40:10.600 --> 00:40:13.020
What is the connection between
the grammatical categories

00:40:13.020 --> 00:40:14.435
of the first and third person

00:40:14.435 --> 00:40:17.240
and the distinction between self belief

00:40:17.240 --> 00:40:20.100
and belief about the
person one happens to be?

00:40:20.100 --> 00:40:21.552
Why do the writers

00:40:21.552 --> 00:40:23.910
two different ways of referring to himself

00:40:23.910 --> 00:40:25.230
express different thoughts

00:40:25.230 --> 00:40:28.610
and have different effects
on us the way that they do

00:40:28.610 --> 00:40:30.763
even though they refer to the same person?

00:40:32.350 --> 00:40:34.070
The two ways of referring to himself

00:40:34.070 --> 00:40:36.050
allow the writer to say things like,

00:40:36.050 --> 00:40:38.500
I know of Borges from the mail

00:40:39.650 --> 00:40:42.280
which is different from saying
I know of I from the mail

00:40:42.280 --> 00:40:44.210
or Borges knows of Borges from the mail.

00:40:44.210 --> 00:40:45.570
He's saying something different,

00:40:45.570 --> 00:40:48.080
I know of Borges from the mail.

00:40:48.080 --> 00:40:50.353
I try to free myself from him.

00:40:52.130 --> 00:40:53.190
He can say these things

00:40:53.190 --> 00:40:55.480
without seeming to imply the rather odd

00:40:55.480 --> 00:40:56.920
I know myself from the mail

00:40:56.920 --> 00:41:00.410
or I try to free myself from myself.

00:41:00.410 --> 00:41:03.850
Although the last two are
consequences of the first two

00:41:03.850 --> 00:41:05.462
given the fact that we know

00:41:05.462 --> 00:41:07.620
and without with the
story would have no point,

00:41:07.620 --> 00:41:09.173
that Borges is the writer.

00:41:11.600 --> 00:41:12.860
So the first statement means

00:41:12.860 --> 00:41:13.983
and conveys something quite different

00:41:13.983 --> 00:41:15.820
than I know of myself from the mail.

00:41:15.820 --> 00:41:17.480
I know of Borges from
the mail is one thing.

00:41:17.480 --> 00:41:19.797
I know of myself from
the mail is the other.

00:41:23.770 --> 00:41:25.860
Even though these sentences
from the author's pen

00:41:25.860 --> 00:41:28.450
seem to have in some sense
the same truth convictions.

00:41:28.450 --> 00:41:29.830
Since Borges is the writer,

00:41:29.830 --> 00:41:31.090
the first statement is true

00:41:31.090 --> 00:41:33.600
if Borges knows of Borges through the mail

00:41:33.600 --> 00:41:36.140
and the writer knows of the
writer through the mail.

00:41:36.140 --> 00:41:36.973
The second is true

00:41:36.973 --> 00:41:39.203
if Borges tries to free Borges from Borges

00:41:39.203 --> 00:41:42.270
and the writer tires to free
the writer from the writer

00:41:42.270 --> 00:41:44.170
but we do not draw these implications

00:41:44.170 --> 00:41:45.740
but find some less meaning

00:41:45.740 --> 00:41:47.880
that conveys something
about the writer's thoughts

00:41:47.880 --> 00:41:50.763
and how he is alienated
from aspects of himself.

00:41:51.650 --> 00:41:54.310
A familiar concept of the
truth conditions of a statement

00:41:54.310 --> 00:41:56.430
is simply that it is what has the hold

00:41:56.430 --> 00:41:58.240
of the things referred
to in the statement,

00:41:58.240 --> 00:41:59.453
the subject matter,

00:42:00.447 --> 00:42:02.980
is simply what has the hold

00:42:02.980 --> 00:42:05.320
of the things referred
to in the statement,

00:42:05.320 --> 00:42:07.000
the subject matter,

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:07.890
for the statement to be true.

00:42:07.890 --> 00:42:10.563
I'll call this the subject
matter truth conditions.

00:42:13.210 --> 00:42:15.050
Since the truth conditions are the same

00:42:15.050 --> 00:42:16.400
but what is conveyed is different,

00:42:16.400 --> 00:42:18.290
what is conveyed cannot depend on

00:42:18.290 --> 00:42:20.593
or depend only on the subject
matter truth conditions,

00:42:20.593 --> 00:42:24.550
that is if I like coffee
and Borges likes coffee

00:42:24.550 --> 00:42:26.430
can convey different thoughts to us

00:42:26.430 --> 00:42:28.660
but their subject matter
truth conditions are the same,

00:42:28.660 --> 00:42:30.950
namely that this guy Borges likes coffee.

00:42:30.950 --> 00:42:33.780
There's got to be more to
these thoughts and sentences

00:42:33.780 --> 00:42:35.300
than that.

00:42:35.300 --> 00:42:36.490
Clearly there's some difference

00:42:36.490 --> 00:42:39.100
that is made by the difference
between the first person I

00:42:39.100 --> 00:42:40.120
and the name Borges

00:42:40.120 --> 00:42:42.660
even though they both refer to Borges.

00:42:42.660 --> 00:42:44.610
We can borrow Frege's
term for the difference

00:42:44.610 --> 00:42:46.660
between the two co referring expressions,

00:42:46.660 --> 00:42:49.623
they are associated with
different modes of presentation.

00:42:50.550 --> 00:42:54.410
The terms Borges and the first person I

00:42:54.410 --> 00:42:55.360
written by Borges,

00:42:55.360 --> 00:42:56.490
both refer to Borges

00:42:56.490 --> 00:42:57.890
but the way they do so

00:42:57.890 --> 00:43:01.150
and so the way they present
Borges to us is different.

00:43:01.150 --> 00:43:03.758
What allows the sentences to
convey quite different thoughts

00:43:03.758 --> 00:43:06.230
even though the only
difference between them

00:43:06.230 --> 00:43:08.710
consists of which co
referring term was used?

00:43:08.710 --> 00:43:10.003
What is this difference?

00:43:11.871 --> 00:43:15.300
Those of us old enough to
remember General de Gaulle

00:43:15.300 --> 00:43:18.250
or Bob Dole for that matter

00:43:18.250 --> 00:43:20.770
will in the case of General de Gaulle

00:43:20.770 --> 00:43:23.300
will recall his curious
habit of referring to himself

00:43:23.300 --> 00:43:24.593
in the third person.

00:43:25.630 --> 00:43:28.040
I don't suppose he did this all the time

00:43:28.040 --> 00:43:29.190
but let's imagine that he did.

00:43:29.190 --> 00:43:32.150
So you're sitting at a
dinner party with de Gaulle

00:43:32.150 --> 00:43:34.090
whom we'll suppose is speaking English

00:43:34.090 --> 00:43:35.610
much as we've been ignoring the fact

00:43:35.610 --> 00:43:37.740
that Borges wrote in Spanish.

00:43:37.740 --> 00:43:42.320
So De Gaulle Says, "De
Gaulle would like some salt."

00:43:42.320 --> 00:43:43.730
So you pass him the salt.

00:43:43.730 --> 00:43:44.900
You see the deep connection

00:43:44.900 --> 00:43:47.864
with John's work on performatives

00:43:47.864 --> 00:43:50.740
and speech acts.

00:43:50.740 --> 00:43:54.470
There actually is a deep
connection but I digress.

00:43:54.470 --> 00:43:58.610
Why does it sound so pompous
when De Gaulle says this

00:43:58.610 --> 00:44:01.440
as opposed to just saying,
"I would like the salt."?

00:44:02.860 --> 00:44:03.840
The reason, I suggest,

00:44:03.840 --> 00:44:05.477
lies in the difference
between the way names work

00:44:05.477 --> 00:44:08.190
and the way pronouns like I work.

00:44:08.190 --> 00:44:09.450
There are simple conventions

00:44:09.450 --> 00:44:12.392
that allow us to refer
to persons with names.

00:44:12.392 --> 00:44:14.080
To use my favorite example,

00:44:14.080 --> 00:44:15.210
the name David Kaplan,

00:44:15.210 --> 00:44:17.260
which is the way of referring
to the famous logician

00:44:17.260 --> 00:44:20.360
is a way of referring to the
famous logician David Kaplan.

00:44:20.360 --> 00:44:21.400
The same name,

00:44:21.400 --> 00:44:22.430
it's my favorite example

00:44:22.430 --> 00:44:23.430
'cause he denies this

00:44:23.430 --> 00:44:25.800
'cause he thinks you individuate
names by their bearers

00:44:25.800 --> 00:44:27.600
but that's really not germane to today

00:44:27.600 --> 00:44:29.310
so I won't say anything more about it.

00:44:29.310 --> 00:44:31.340
The same name is also a way of referring

00:44:31.340 --> 00:44:33.573
to a professor in
Stanford's medical school.

00:44:34.500 --> 00:44:36.940
Two different conventions
established at different time

00:44:36.940 --> 00:44:38.180
by different parents

00:44:38.180 --> 00:44:40.450
that allow us to refer
to two different people

00:44:40.450 --> 00:44:42.780
with the name David Kaplan.

00:44:42.780 --> 00:44:45.400
And there are lots of other
David Kaplans in the world.

00:44:45.400 --> 00:44:48.100
There are more than 1,000
David Kaplans in California.

00:44:49.750 --> 00:44:50.830
See, you don't know either

00:44:50.830 --> 00:44:52.040
so nobody's really...

00:44:53.260 --> 00:44:55.710
Still, we can usually
figure out which conventions

00:44:55.710 --> 00:44:56.900
are being exploited,

00:44:56.900 --> 00:44:59.620
which David Kaplan is being talked about.

00:44:59.620 --> 00:45:02.160
Suppose you were at a dinner
party with David Kaplan.

00:45:02.160 --> 00:45:04.670
He's too far from the salt
to reach it and so are you

00:45:04.670 --> 00:45:06.300
but you are next to someone who can

00:45:06.300 --> 00:45:08.750
and you have discerned that
Kaplan would like the salt

00:45:08.750 --> 00:45:10.180
because of his baleful look

00:45:10.180 --> 00:45:11.570
in the direction of the salt cellar

00:45:11.570 --> 00:45:13.887
after his first bite of steak.

00:45:13.887 --> 00:45:15.880
"David Kaplan would like the salt, "

00:45:15.880 --> 00:45:18.310
you say to the fellow next to you.

00:45:18.310 --> 00:45:19.803
This doesn't sound pompous

00:45:19.803 --> 00:45:23.290
but note that it presumes that
the person you are talking to

00:45:23.290 --> 00:45:25.440
knows which of the
individuals around the table

00:45:25.440 --> 00:45:27.280
is named David Kaplan.

00:45:27.280 --> 00:45:28.530
You had an alternative way

00:45:28.530 --> 00:45:30.020
of getting the salt passed to Kaplan,

00:45:30.020 --> 00:45:31.587
you could've pointed to Kaplan and said,

00:45:31.587 --> 00:45:33.370
"He would like the salt."

00:45:33.370 --> 00:45:34.510
Which way you said it

00:45:34.510 --> 00:45:37.010
would depend on what you
felt you could assume

00:45:37.010 --> 00:45:38.710
about your addressee's knowledge,

00:45:38.710 --> 00:45:41.070
that is the two ways
of referring to Kaplan

00:45:41.070 --> 00:45:44.220
make different cognitive
demands on the listener.

00:45:44.220 --> 00:45:46.600
Using Kaplan's name doesn't sound pompous

00:45:46.600 --> 00:45:50.350
because you aren't assuming
everyone knows your name.

00:45:50.350 --> 00:45:51.490
This is what De Gaulle did

00:45:51.490 --> 00:45:53.120
and this accounts, I suggest,

00:45:53.120 --> 00:45:54.310
for it sounding pompous,

00:45:54.310 --> 00:45:57.243
although in his case, the
assumption was no doubt correct.

00:45:58.520 --> 00:46:00.800
So when we plan our utterances

00:46:00.800 --> 00:46:02.481
and assess the effect they have,

00:46:02.481 --> 00:46:04.430
and what people might learn from them

00:46:04.430 --> 00:46:06.030
and what they need to
know to understand them,

00:46:06.030 --> 00:46:08.330
it's not just the subject
matter truth conditions,

00:46:08.330 --> 00:46:10.930
who we're talking about and
what we're saying about them

00:46:10.930 --> 00:46:12.850
that we exploit and need to worry about.

00:46:12.850 --> 00:46:15.130
The effect of our utterances
and the thoughts they express

00:46:15.130 --> 00:46:17.230
depend on how we refer to things,

00:46:17.230 --> 00:46:20.210
not just on the things we refer to.

00:46:20.210 --> 00:46:22.230
When Borges refers to himself with I

00:46:22.230 --> 00:46:23.740
we think of him in one way,

00:46:23.740 --> 00:46:26.170
as the writer of the words we are reading.

00:46:26.170 --> 00:46:27.730
To think of Borges as the writer

00:46:27.730 --> 00:46:28.890
is to think of him as the one

00:46:28.890 --> 00:46:30.190
who's thoughts are being expressed

00:46:30.190 --> 00:46:31.260
in the words we read,

00:46:31.260 --> 00:46:32.840
that is his current thoughts,

00:46:32.840 --> 00:46:34.580
the one that guided the pen as he wrote

00:46:34.580 --> 00:46:36.700
or the fingers as he typed.

00:46:36.700 --> 00:46:39.070
The name Borges written
by Borges or anyone else

00:46:39.070 --> 00:46:40.570
refers to a virtue of conventions

00:46:40.570 --> 00:46:43.213
known by all who know him or know of him.

00:46:43.213 --> 00:46:45.010
So in using the first person

00:46:45.010 --> 00:46:46.410
in referring to his own name,

00:46:46.410 --> 00:46:49.110
Borges makes different
cognitive demands on the reader

00:46:49.110 --> 00:46:50.870
and we react to those different demands

00:46:50.870 --> 00:46:51.970
by interpreting the thoughts

00:46:51.970 --> 00:46:53.750
he wishes to convey differently.

00:46:53.750 --> 00:46:56.310
He in effect, asks us
to bracket the knowledge

00:46:56.310 --> 00:46:58.130
we don't need to use

00:46:58.130 --> 00:47:00.700
in understanding the
reference of his words.

00:47:00.700 --> 00:47:02.090
When he uses the first person,

00:47:02.090 --> 00:47:03.460
we bracket the facts we know

00:47:03.460 --> 00:47:06.400
through information we've
accessed through the name Borges.

00:47:06.400 --> 00:47:07.600
When he uses Borges,

00:47:07.600 --> 00:47:08.820
we bracket the facts we know

00:47:08.820 --> 00:47:10.380
in virtue of the user of the name

00:47:10.380 --> 00:47:11.999
being the referent of that name.

00:47:11.999 --> 00:47:14.930
So he invents two different characters,

00:47:14.930 --> 00:47:16.690
one is a writer who is telling us

00:47:16.690 --> 00:47:18.380
about his relation to the other,

00:47:18.380 --> 00:47:21.070
Borges, a well known author.

00:47:21.070 --> 00:47:22.490
These facts about language

00:47:22.490 --> 00:47:24.640
and about the difference
between names and pronouns

00:47:24.640 --> 00:47:25.490
and especially I,

00:47:25.490 --> 00:47:27.540
are a special case of
the general differences

00:47:27.540 --> 00:47:31.410
between role based and detached
system of information acts

00:47:31.410 --> 00:47:33.630
we considered above.

00:47:33.630 --> 00:47:36.150
I is a self affecting way

00:47:36.150 --> 00:47:37.730
of referring to a person.

00:47:37.730 --> 00:47:40.840
It is a way anyone has
of referring to himself

00:47:40.840 --> 00:47:43.630
and it doesn't depend on
knowledge of ones own name

00:47:43.630 --> 00:47:45.960
any more than eating the
sandwich in front of one

00:47:45.960 --> 00:47:48.110
depends on knowing ones own name.

00:47:48.110 --> 00:47:50.910
Borges is a detached way
of referring to Borges.

00:47:50.910 --> 00:47:53.240
Anyone can refer to Borges in that way,

00:47:53.240 --> 00:47:55.050
whatever role he plays in their lives

00:47:55.050 --> 00:47:56.920
and whether or not they

00:47:57.838 --> 00:48:01.350
and whether or not they
know who plays that role.

00:48:01.350 --> 00:48:02.410
I don't know what I meant by that

00:48:02.410 --> 00:48:04.359
but that's what it says.

00:48:04.359 --> 00:48:06.110
So a first interpretation,

00:48:06.110 --> 00:48:07.550
we now have enough materials

00:48:07.550 --> 00:48:10.220
for a first pass at an
interpretation of the story

00:48:10.220 --> 00:48:11.180
that Borges gave us.

00:48:11.180 --> 00:48:12.420
The author is the writer

00:48:12.420 --> 00:48:15.210
and has the thoughts the
writer is depicted as having.

00:48:15.210 --> 00:48:17.800
The writer and the author
both like maps, hourglasses,

00:48:17.800 --> 00:48:19.060
typography and Stephenson

00:48:19.060 --> 00:48:21.480
in a way the writer is
depicted as liking them.

00:48:21.480 --> 00:48:24.160
The characteristics attributed
to Borges by the writer

00:48:24.160 --> 00:48:26.380
liking these things in
a vain way, for example,

00:48:26.380 --> 00:48:29.140
are not the ones the author actually has.

00:48:29.140 --> 00:48:30.290
They are the ones he would have

00:48:30.290 --> 00:48:32.050
if the things attributed
to him by the press,

00:48:32.050 --> 00:48:34.010
critics, publicist, were correct.

00:48:34.010 --> 00:48:34.930
The works of the author

00:48:34.930 --> 00:48:36.710
together with the writings
of critics and the like

00:48:36.710 --> 00:48:39.080
have created a public concept or persona

00:48:39.080 --> 00:48:40.940
of the author that is not accurate

00:48:40.940 --> 00:48:42.940
and yet the author is
constantly exposed to it

00:48:42.940 --> 00:48:44.390
in the same way that everyone else is

00:48:44.390 --> 00:48:45.730
and cannot avoid it.

00:48:45.730 --> 00:48:47.940
The key to this pool of
accurate, semi accurate

00:48:47.940 --> 00:48:51.570
and inaccurate depictions of the author

00:48:51.570 --> 00:48:52.955
is his name Borges

00:48:52.955 --> 00:48:56.560
and so this name is used to
create a character in the story.

00:48:56.560 --> 00:48:58.950
We can pretend that the
concept correctly describes

00:48:58.950 --> 00:48:59.850
someone real

00:48:59.850 --> 00:49:02.388
towards which the writer
feels considerable annoyance.

00:49:02.388 --> 00:49:04.290
When the writer tries to do things

00:49:04.290 --> 00:49:06.830
and write things that don't
conform to the public persona,

00:49:06.830 --> 00:49:09.230
these things are simply absorbed
into the public persona,

00:49:09.230 --> 00:49:10.320
interpreted in its light,

00:49:10.320 --> 00:49:12.380
changing it but not making it accurate.

00:49:12.380 --> 00:49:16.090
He appreciates this concept of himself,

00:49:16.090 --> 00:49:17.320
the inaccurate one,

00:49:17.320 --> 00:49:19.980
as what will live on
along with his literature.

00:49:19.980 --> 00:49:21.133
Only by being the person

00:49:21.133 --> 00:49:23.170
that this concept inaccurately portrays

00:49:23.170 --> 00:49:25.660
will he continue to be known to survive.

00:49:25.660 --> 00:49:27.483
Thus, the penultimate sentences.

00:49:28.396 --> 00:49:30.927
"Years ago I tried to free myself from him

00:49:30.927 --> 00:49:32.877
"and went into the
mythology to the suburbs

00:49:32.877 --> 00:49:35.027
"to the games with time and infinity

00:49:35.027 --> 00:49:37.387
"but these games belong to Borges now

00:49:37.387 --> 00:49:38.807
"and I shall have to imagine other things.

00:49:38.807 --> 00:49:40.967
"Thus, my life is a flight
and I lose everything

00:49:40.967 --> 00:49:44.040
"and everything belongs
to oblivion or to him."

00:49:44.040 --> 00:49:46.880
But, unfortunately, the end of
the story if taken seriously

00:49:46.880 --> 00:49:49.050
belies this interpretation.

00:49:49.050 --> 00:49:50.837
He say, "I do not know which of us

00:49:50.837 --> 00:49:52.417
"has written this page."

00:49:53.263 --> 00:49:55.060
If the character Borges

00:49:55.060 --> 00:49:57.527
is simply the author's
personification for literary effect

00:49:57.527 --> 00:49:59.820
of an inaccurate concept of the writer,

00:49:59.820 --> 00:50:01.280
how could there be any possibility

00:50:01.280 --> 00:50:02.928
of Borges having written the page

00:50:02.928 --> 00:50:05.620
that didn't involve the
writer writing the page?

00:50:05.620 --> 00:50:07.700
How are we to interpret
that last sentence?

00:50:07.700 --> 00:50:08.870
It seems to open the door

00:50:08.870 --> 00:50:11.470
for a somewhat different
interpretation of the story.

00:50:11.470 --> 00:50:13.890
The writer and Borges are
both real, both agents,

00:50:13.890 --> 00:50:16.800
different aspects of selves of the author.

00:50:16.800 --> 00:50:19.254
So it makes some sense to attribute agency

00:50:19.254 --> 00:50:22.392
to one and not the other for some things

00:50:22.392 --> 00:50:23.750
and the other and not the one for others.

00:50:23.750 --> 00:50:26.260
But what sense can we make
of such multiple selves

00:50:26.260 --> 00:50:29.310
and bifurcated agency
with a single person?

00:50:29.310 --> 00:50:31.100
Well, I'll say a little bit about that

00:50:31.100 --> 00:50:32.840
and then I'll be done.

00:50:32.840 --> 00:50:34.970
So this section is called Borges' Selves.

00:50:35.900 --> 00:50:38.210
I think selves are basically just people

00:50:38.210 --> 00:50:40.460
seen as playing the
role of the same person

00:50:40.460 --> 00:50:41.810
as the subject of some verb,

00:50:41.810 --> 00:50:42.960
the agent of some activity,

00:50:42.960 --> 00:50:44.360
the thinker of some thought,

00:50:44.360 --> 00:50:46.210
the possessor of some
emotion and so forth.

00:50:46.210 --> 00:50:47.520
My neighbor is just a person

00:50:47.520 --> 00:50:48.750
who thought he was playing the role

00:50:48.750 --> 00:50:50.556
of the one who lives next to me.

00:50:50.556 --> 00:50:52.230
My father is just a person

00:50:52.230 --> 00:50:54.139
who plays a role of
being the male parent of,

00:50:54.139 --> 00:50:55.510
relative to me,

00:50:55.510 --> 00:50:56.490
neighboring father are

00:50:56.490 --> 00:51:01.490
role words and so is self.

00:51:01.720 --> 00:51:02.920
On this conception of selves,

00:51:02.920 --> 00:51:04.780
there's only one self per person

00:51:04.780 --> 00:51:08.040
and the person himself or herself is it.

00:51:08.040 --> 00:51:10.660
Still, we often use
phrases like the true self

00:51:10.660 --> 00:51:12.064
or the authentic self.

00:51:12.064 --> 00:51:15.460
Last year or so, Mel Gibson,
arrested for drunk driving,

00:51:15.460 --> 00:51:17.330
made a number of antisemitic remarks

00:51:17.330 --> 00:51:20.070
to the police person
who was arresting him.

00:51:20.070 --> 00:51:22.940
People debate, was that
Gibson's true self emerging

00:51:22.940 --> 00:51:25.638
in the uninhibited state
produced by his drunkenness

00:51:25.638 --> 00:51:28.770
or his his true self the one
that emerged when he sobered up

00:51:28.770 --> 00:51:31.710
and with all of his cognitive
faculties functioning

00:51:31.710 --> 00:51:33.680
was ashamed of what he had said?

00:51:33.680 --> 00:51:35.519
Without taking sides
on the real Mel Gibson

00:51:35.519 --> 00:51:38.210
or even committing yourself to the idea

00:51:38.210 --> 00:51:40.830
that some selves are more
authentic than others,

00:51:40.830 --> 00:51:42.520
I want to see what sense we can make

00:51:42.520 --> 00:51:45.910
of the idea of one person
having multiple selves.

00:51:45.910 --> 00:51:47.900
What I will suggest uses the concept

00:51:47.900 --> 00:51:50.420
of a motivating cognitive complex.

00:51:50.420 --> 00:51:52.560
We begin with the familiar idea

00:51:52.560 --> 00:51:55.493
that actions are motivated
by beliefs and desires.

00:52:00.260 --> 00:52:01.820
If I intentionally do A,

00:52:01.820 --> 00:52:03.553
there will be some combination
of beliefs and desires

00:52:03.553 --> 00:52:06.310
that plays two important
roles in my doing A.

00:52:06.310 --> 00:52:08.983
First, the beliefs and desires are what,

00:52:10.016 --> 00:52:12.645
the beliefs and desires
are what cause me to do A.

00:52:12.645 --> 00:52:14.920
Second, the contents of
the beliefs and desires

00:52:14.920 --> 00:52:17.830
rationalize in a relatively
weak sense of rationalize

00:52:17.830 --> 00:52:18.823
my doing A.

00:52:23.250 --> 00:52:26.830
Now, it's clear you can have
different motivating complexes

00:52:26.830 --> 00:52:29.500
affecting what you're
doing at different times,

00:52:29.500 --> 00:52:32.900
different roles you play
kind of take over your life

00:52:32.900 --> 00:52:34.060
but it can also,

00:52:34.060 --> 00:52:37.840
the competition can be
synchronic as well as diachronic.

00:52:37.840 --> 00:52:39.880
Consider getting out of bed.

00:52:39.880 --> 00:52:43.260
One motivating complex has
control of my thought processes.

00:52:43.260 --> 00:52:46.030
They rationally go over
what is best for me to do

00:52:46.030 --> 00:52:47.870
and determine that it
would be a really good idea

00:52:47.870 --> 00:52:49.890
to move my arms and legs and torso

00:52:49.890 --> 00:52:51.130
in such a way as to bring it about

00:52:51.130 --> 00:52:52.790
that I get out of bed.

00:52:52.790 --> 00:52:54.870
But nothing happens.

00:52:54.870 --> 00:52:55.960
On my diagnosis,

00:52:55.960 --> 00:52:58.320
the cognitive complex that
controls my deliberation

00:52:58.320 --> 00:52:59.770
doesn't control my torso.

00:52:59.770 --> 00:53:02.120
That's controlled by another live reason,

00:53:02.120 --> 00:53:06.913
one that says, "Good to
stay in bed, don't move,"

00:53:06.913 --> 00:53:09.350
"or procrastination,"

00:53:09.350 --> 00:53:10.600
but I won't go into that.

00:53:13.570 --> 00:53:18.310
So as a child, I was
imbued with many opinions

00:53:18.310 --> 00:53:19.720
that in retrospect I don't accept.

00:53:19.720 --> 00:53:21.700
Growing up in Lincoln, Nebraska,

00:53:21.700 --> 00:53:23.660
I was taught by my father and grandfather

00:53:23.660 --> 00:53:24.900
that Roosevelt was a demon

00:53:24.900 --> 00:53:26.020
as were most democrats,

00:53:26.020 --> 00:53:26.853
that there was

00:53:27.923 --> 00:53:31.085
something innately special
about Nebraska football,

00:53:31.085 --> 00:53:32.900
that the supposed superiority

00:53:32.900 --> 00:53:36.010
of places like Harvard and
Yale over our local university

00:53:36.010 --> 00:53:39.450
was a matter of snobism
of wealthy patricians.

00:53:39.450 --> 00:53:41.470
I think all of these cognitive structures,

00:53:41.470 --> 00:53:43.480
they no longer represent my true beliefs

00:53:43.480 --> 00:53:46.870
or really beliefs that I'll
live a shadowy half life

00:53:46.870 --> 00:53:50.640
in the recesses of the
darker regions of my psyche.

00:53:50.640 --> 00:53:53.160
When tired and annoyed
during those parts of my life

00:53:53.160 --> 00:53:55.960
spent with people of a
certain patrician caste

00:53:55.960 --> 00:53:58.700
who don't know or care where Nebraska is,

00:53:58.700 --> 00:53:59.620
the kind of people you meet

00:53:59.620 --> 00:54:02.240
that think that Chicago is
halfway between New York

00:54:02.240 --> 00:54:03.820
and San Francisco

00:54:03.820 --> 00:54:06.250
and kind of have never completely unfolded

00:54:06.250 --> 00:54:07.680
a map of the US

00:54:07.680 --> 00:54:11.010
to discover Texas,
Oklahoma, Kansas, Nebraska,

00:54:11.010 --> 00:54:12.203
North and South Dakota,

00:54:13.590 --> 00:54:17.100
at a bar with people
like this late at night,

00:54:17.100 --> 00:54:18.780
these subterranean near beliefs

00:54:18.780 --> 00:54:20.670
briefly seize control of my thoughts,

00:54:20.670 --> 00:54:22.840
although not usually my mouth.

00:54:22.840 --> 00:54:25.460
Perhaps if I were as
drunk as Mel Gibson was,

00:54:25.460 --> 00:54:27.500
I would find myself
complaining about Roosevelt

00:54:27.500 --> 00:54:29.050
and the New Deal and democrats.

00:54:30.707 --> 00:54:33.080
And I don't know, I was at
a department meeting once

00:54:33.080 --> 00:54:34.140
and of course, not all of you

00:54:34.140 --> 00:54:35.650
have ever been Nancy
Cartwright's colleague

00:54:35.650 --> 00:54:40.650
but I found myself saying rude
things to Nancy Cartwright

00:54:41.428 --> 00:54:44.880
while my consciousness
was totally in the control

00:54:44.880 --> 00:54:48.970
of a much saner individual
saying, "Shut up, you fool."

00:54:48.970 --> 00:54:50.640
So it happens.

00:54:50.640 --> 00:54:53.220
So motivating complexes may be embedded

00:54:53.220 --> 00:54:55.850
in larger structures of
belief about ones self

00:54:55.850 --> 00:54:56.860
and ones situation,

00:54:56.860 --> 00:54:59.670
desires and aspirations,
intentions and plans.

00:54:59.670 --> 00:55:01.990
They do not form a coherent whole

00:55:01.990 --> 00:55:04.350
and different complexes seize control

00:55:04.350 --> 00:55:05.500
of different ways of acting

00:55:05.500 --> 00:55:07.660
in various situations and moods.

00:55:07.660 --> 00:55:08.770
Borges in the story

00:55:08.770 --> 00:55:10.810
is not simply on this
second interpretation

00:55:10.810 --> 00:55:13.680
of personification of an
inaccurate public persona,

00:55:13.680 --> 00:55:15.910
but one part of a not totally coherent

00:55:15.910 --> 00:55:19.130
and integrated self concept, self notion.

00:55:19.130 --> 00:55:19.963
In certain moods,

00:55:19.963 --> 00:55:22.910
the author is Borges, the
public persona coincides

00:55:27.597 --> 00:55:30.808
with a subset of the author's
psyche that has control.

00:55:30.808 --> 00:55:33.130
At such times, the
author really does become

00:55:33.130 --> 00:55:35.100
a bit of an actor (speaking
in foreign language)

00:55:35.100 --> 00:55:36.480
writing and publishing things,

00:55:36.480 --> 00:55:37.940
giving interviews and talks

00:55:37.940 --> 00:55:39.800
that strike him in other moods

00:55:39.800 --> 00:55:41.300
as alien and pompous,

00:55:41.300 --> 00:55:43.550
though not without interest and value.

00:55:43.550 --> 00:55:45.447
Perhaps in productive authorial moods,

00:55:45.447 --> 00:55:47.330
the self conception that one has control

00:55:47.330 --> 00:55:49.890
when he walks in the
streets of Buenos Aires,

00:55:49.890 --> 00:55:53.160
anonymous, unaffected,
unmotivated by larger ambitions,

00:55:53.160 --> 00:55:55.527
can control only an inner
voice that says things like,

00:55:55.527 --> 00:55:57.260
"You're being a pompous ass,"

00:55:57.260 --> 00:55:59.730
or some more sophisticated
Borgesian version

00:55:59.730 --> 00:56:00.703
of such a thought.

00:56:01.540 --> 00:56:04.410
So interpreted there is
in some reasonable sense

00:56:04.410 --> 00:56:07.140
two selves corresponding to the
two characters in the story,

00:56:07.140 --> 00:56:08.910
corresponding to two self conceptions,

00:56:08.910 --> 00:56:11.540
two overlapping but differently
significant complexes

00:56:11.540 --> 00:56:13.940
of desires, ambitions and intentions

00:56:13.940 --> 00:56:15.080
both belonging in some way

00:56:15.080 --> 00:56:16.750
to the same self notion

00:56:16.750 --> 00:56:18.500
that Borges finds within himself,

00:56:18.500 --> 00:56:21.720
each taking control in turn
as mood and situation change

00:56:21.720 --> 00:56:24.350
and energy and ambition ebb and flow.

00:56:24.350 --> 00:56:27.270
If so, the answer to the question
posed by the last sentence

00:56:27.270 --> 00:56:29.660
would probably be Borges.

00:56:29.660 --> 00:56:31.800
The writer may have
originally had the thoughts

00:56:31.800 --> 00:56:33.600
the story tells us about

00:56:33.600 --> 00:56:36.810
but somebody had to write them
down, edit them, polish them

00:56:36.810 --> 00:56:38.250
and arranged for them to be published

00:56:38.250 --> 00:56:39.830
or we never would've seen them.

00:56:39.830 --> 00:56:41.740
This seems like the sort
of thing that Borges

00:56:41.740 --> 00:56:42.573
and not the writer

00:56:42.573 --> 00:56:44.750
would take the time and effort to do.

00:56:44.750 --> 00:56:46.770
That is, it's the sort
of thing that the author,

00:56:46.770 --> 00:56:50.010
under the influence of his
authorial cognitive complex

00:56:50.010 --> 00:56:50.843
would do.

00:56:50.843 --> 00:56:52.180
Thank you.

00:56:52.180 --> 00:56:55.635
(audience applause)

00:56:55.635 --> 00:56:58.218
(upbeat music)
